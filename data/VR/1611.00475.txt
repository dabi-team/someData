Abstract Based on high-resolution spectroscopy performed with the NES echelle
spectrograph of the 6-m telescope, we have studied the peculiarities of the spec-
trum and the velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere and envelope of the cool supergiant
V1027 Cyg, the optical counterpart of the infrared source IRAS 20004+2955. For
the ﬁrst time, a splitting of the cores of strong absorptions of metals and their ions
(Si II, Ni I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, Cr I, Fe I, Fe II, Ba II) has been detected in the stellar
spectrum. The broad proﬁle of these lines contains a stable weak emission in the
core whose position may be considered as the systematic velocity Vsys = 5.5 km/s.
Small radial velocity variations with an amplitude of 5–6 km/s due to pulsations
have been revealed by symmetric low- and moderate-intensity absorptions. A long-
wavelength shift of the Hα proﬁle due to line core distortion is observed in the stellar
spectrum. Numerous weak CN molecular lines and the K I 7696 ˚A line with a P Cyg
proﬁle have been identiﬁed in the red spectral region. The coincidence of the ra-
dial velocities measured from symmetric metal absorptions and CN lines suggests
that the CN spectrum is formed in the stellar atmosphere. We have also identi-
ﬁed numerous diﬀuse interstellar bands (DIBs) whose positions in the spectrum,
Vr(DIBs) =−12.0 km/s, correspond to the velocity of the interstellar medium in the
Local arm of the Galaxy.
Keywords: stars, evolution, AGB stars, circumstellar envelopes, optical spectroscopy.

1. Introduction

The cool supergiant V1027 Cyg of MK spectral type Sp = G7 Ia (Keenan and McNeil,
1989) is associated with the infrared source IRAS 20004+2955. Volk and Kwok (1989)
modeled the peculiar, very ﬂat, IR spectrum of IRAS 20004+2955 and concluded that the
object is observed at the very beginning of the evolutionary transition from the asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) to a planetary nebula. Kwok (1993) entered this star in his widely
known list of protoplanetary nebula (PPN) candidates, stars in transition to the planetary

nebular stage. However, V1027 Cyg has remained poorly studied until the present time;
there is no consensus on the evolutionary status of this star.

Based on UBV photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy, Arkhipova et al. (1992)
classiﬁed this star as a semiregular variable with an amplitude of brightness variations
increasing from V to U from 0.4 to 0.8 mag. These authors concluded that interstellar
extinction is responsible for the bulk of the reddening in V1027 Cyg, while the pattern
of brightness and color variability suggested that its variability is caused by pulsations.
Subsequently, having measured the radial velocities Vr with a correlation spectrometer,
Arkhipova et al. (1997) detected a radial velocity variability in the range −10 ÷ +20 km/s
and pointed out a strengthening of Ba II lines. All the values of Vr from Hrivnak and
Wenxian (2000) also ﬁt into this velocity range.

Based on the spectra taken with the echelle spectrograph of the 6-m telescope,
Klochkova et al. (2000a) determined the main parameters of V1027 Cyg (eﬀective tem-
perature Teﬀ = 5000 K, surface gravity log g = 1.0), its metallicity [Fe/H]⊙ =−0.2, and the
abundances of 16 elements in the stellar atmosphere by the model atmosphere method.
The nearly solar metallicity in combination with the low radial velocity of the star sug-
gest that V1027 Cyg belongs to the Galactic disk population. Taranova et al. (2009)
performed long-term JHKLM photometry for yellow supergiants and detected a small-
amplitude (≤ 0.25 mag) IR brightness variability with a probable period of about 237 days
in V1027 Cyg. Using the same observations, Bogdanov and Taranova (2009) computed
the model of a spherical circumstellar envelope and estimated the mass loss rate to be
1.3×10−5M⊙/yr.

The radial velocity variability of V1027 Cyg and the evidence for the peculiarity of
its spectrum found by Klochkova et al. (2000a) serve to us as a stimulus to continue the
observations of V1027 Cyg. In this paper we present the results of our optical spectroscopy
for this star performed with the 6-m telescope over several nights in 2013–2015. The goal of
these observations is a detailed study of the stellar spectrum and its possible variability as
well as the kinematic state of the atmosphere of V1027 Cyg, its circumstellar envelope, and
the interstellar medium toward this star with Galactic coordinates l = 67.4◦ and b =−0.3◦.
Our observational data are brieﬂy described in the next section. Subsequently, we pro-
vide information about the peculiarities of the proﬁles for the spectral features detected
from high-resolution spectra, analyze them, and discuss our results. Our brief conclusions
are presented in the last section.

2. Observational data

We took the spectra of V1027 Cyg at the Nasmyth focus of the 6-m telescope with the
NES echelle spectrograph (Panchuk et al. 2007, 2009). In combination with an image slicer
(Panchuk et al. 2003), the NES spectrograph provides a spectral resolution R≈60 000
in a wide wavelength range. A 2048×4096-pixel CCD array has been used at the NES
spectrograph since 2011, which has allowed the simultaneously recorded spectral range to
be extended considerably. The times of observations of V1027 Cyg with the 6-m telescope
and the recorded spectral range are given in Table 1. In addition, for comparison, we
invoke the stellar spectra taken during several observational sets in 1997 with the NES and
PFES echelle spectrographs and used in Klochkova et al. (2000a). The NES spectrograph
in its ﬁrst modifcation in combination with a 1k×1k CCD array provided a resolution
R≈35 000. The PFES spectrograph designed for the observations of faint stars with a
resolution R≈15 000 (Panchuk et al. 1997) is mounted at the prime focus of the 6-m
telescope.

The details of our spectrophotometric and positional measurements in the spectra were
described in previously published papers; the corresponding references to them were given
by Klochkova (2014). Note that applying the image slicer required a signiﬁcant modication
of the standard ECHELLE procedures of the MIDAS software package. The cosmicray
particle hits were removed by median averaging of two spectra taken successively one after
another. The wavelength calibration was performed using the spectra of a hollow-cathode
Th–Ar lamp. The data were extracted from two-dimensional echelle spectra with the
software package described by Yushkin and Klochkova (2005). The latest version of the
DECH code (Galazutdinov 1992) was used to reduce the extracted spectra. In particular, it
allows the radial velocities to be measured from individual features of complex lines typical
of the spectra of the investigated stars. The positional zero point of each spectrogram
was determined in a standard way, by referencing to the positions of ionospheric night-
sky emissions and telluric absorptions, which are observed against the background of the
object spectrum. The accuracy of measuring the velocity from one line in the NES spectra
is ≈1.0 km/s.

3. Main results

Previously unknown peculiarities of the spectrum

On the whole, the high-resolution optical spectrum of V1027 Cyg corresponds to its MK
classiﬁcaion G7 Ia (Keenan and McNeil, 1989). The absence of a visible emission in Hα is
quite unexpected for a pulsating variable (see Fig. 1). An emission in Hα was also absent
in the earlier spectra of this star taken with the 6-m telescope and used by Klochkova
et al. (2000a) to determine the atmospheric chemical composition of this star. A strong
(above the continuum level) and time-variable emission is a typical signature of long-
period variables (LPVs). The well studied LPV star R Sct, in the optical spectra of which
the intensity of the emission in Hα at some phases exceeds the continuum level manyfold
(Lebre and Gillet 1991; Kipper and Klochkova 2013), can serve as an example. An equally
powerful emission in Hα was recorded by Klochkova et al. (2006) in the spectrum of the
AGB star identiﬁed with the IR source IRAS 20508+2011. Over the four-year period of

observations of this object with the 6-m telescope the absorption–emission Hα proﬁle
changed from a bell shaped emission with a weak absorption in the core to a double–
peaked emission with a central absorption lying below the continuum.

However, in the absence of an emission in Hα, we detected a number of other, subtler
peculiarities in the spectrum of V1027 Cyg due to the high quality of our observational
data. We saw a new peculiarity of strong absorptions: the lines with a low lower-level
excitation potential (χlow < 1.5 eV) have a complex proﬁle including two absorptions
with close intensities separated by an emission peak. To illustrate this peculiarity, Fig. 2
presents a fragment of the spectrum containing the strong and split Mg I, Fe I, Fe II, and
Ti II absorptions. In addition, it emerged that the proﬁles of such strong absorptions are
variable in time. In Fig. 3, where the proﬁles of the two strong Ba II 6141 ˚A and Fe I 6393 ˚A
absorptions in the spectra taken on diﬀerent dates are compared, apart from line doubling,
line depth variability is clearly seen.

The diﬀerence in the behavior of lines with diﬀerent intensities is shown in Fig. 4, where
the proﬁles of the medium–intensity Fe II 6147 ˚A line are compared with the Ba II 6141 ˚A
line proﬁles. As can be seen from Figs. 3 and 4, the blue wing in the short–wavelength
component of the Ba II 6141 line is steeper than the red wing of the long–wavelength com-
ponent. This diﬀerence may point to a diﬀerence between the physical conditions under

which these spectral features are formed. The shape of the long-wavelength absorption
proﬁle is more stable, while the shape of the blue wing in the short-wavelength absorption
changes signiﬁcantly with time. The blue wing of the strong absorptions can be assumed
to be formed under nstable conditions in the outer layers of the supergiants extended
atmosphere aﬀected by pulsations. Note also that the blue wing in the short-wavelength
absorptions changes synchronously with the Hα core.

It is important to emphasize in connection with the revealed anomalies of the strong
absorptions that the abundances of chemical elements in the atmosphere of V1027 Cyg
calculated previously by Klochkova et al. (2000a) do not require any correction, because
in their calculations these authors used lines of a limited intensity with equivalent widths
smaller than 200 m˚A.

The only emission whose intensity exceeds considerably the continuum level in the
spectrum of V1027 Cyg is the emission component of the K I 7696 ˚A line. The P Cyg
proﬁle of this line in “Relative intensity – Radial velocity” coordinates is presented in
Fig. 5 in comparison with the proﬁle of the resonance Na I D lines. Comparison of the
K I 7696 ˚A and Na I D line proﬁles allows us to suspect the presence of a weak emission
feature in the long–wavelength wing of the Na I D lines.

Kinematic state of the stellar atmosphere

The presence of peculiarities in the proﬁles of strong lines and their variability suggest
that diﬀerential line shifts are probable in the spectrum and that these shifts are vari-
able in time. Therefore, for our search of radial velocity variations we selected low- and
moderate-intensity absorptions with symmetric proﬁles without any visible peculiarities.
Such absorptions are formed in deep layers of the stellar atmosphere and are not subjected
to the possible inﬂuence of kinematic eﬀects in the uppermost layers of the extended atmo-
sphere. Tables 1 and 2 present the heliocentric radial velocities Vr measured from various
types of spectral features in the available spectra of V1027 Cyg. We will rely on these data
in our subsequent analysis of the spectrum peculiarities.

Figure 3. Split Ba II 6141.42 ˚A (left) and Fe I 6393.6 ˚A (right) line proﬁles in the spectra of
V1027 Cyg for three dates of observations: October 13, 2013 (thick solid curve), April 28,
2015 (dashed curve), and September 3, 2015 (thin solid curve).

The mean velocities Vr(abs) corresponding to the positions of extensive samples of
symmetric absorptions are given in column 4 of Table 1. For three dates of observations we
obtained radial velocities in the range from −4.1 ± 0.1 to +9.1 ± 0.1 km/s. This variability
of Vr(abs) is a manifestation of the pulsations of the V1027 Cyg atmosphere. Recall that
the temperature of V1027 Cyg is Teﬀ = 5000 K, which, according to Soker (2008), is close
to the boundary of the transition from the AGB stage to the succeeding post-AGB one. As
follows from the paper by Aikawa (2010), the AGB star with parameters Teﬀ = 5000 K and
log g = 1.0 entered the instability strip and can have radial pulsations. Having analyzed
the long-term behavior of the UBV data for V1027 Cyg, Arkhipova et al. (2000) reached
the conclusion about pulsations of the star in the fundamental mode and the ﬁrst overtone
with periods of P≈ 306 and 250 days.

arrows indicate the mean radial velocities Vr(abs) from Table 2 measured from symmetric
absorptions in the spectra for each time of observations.

The results of our radial velocity measurements from the position of the component
in the strongest absorptions are quite unexpected. The mean velocities from the full
proﬁles of these strong features Vr(full) are given in the last column of Table 2. The
accuracy of measuring the position of the full proﬁle for the split absorptions is lower
than that for the remaining features of their proﬁle due to its asymmetry. However, the
accuracy is suﬃcient to conclude that the positions of the proﬁles are constant. These
positions of the strong absorptions are clearly seen in Fig. 4, where the proﬁles of the
strong Ba II 6141 ˚A line and the moderate–intensity Fe II 6147 ˚A line for three times of
observations are compared on separate panels. Here, the position of the weak Fe II 6147 ˚A
line in each spectrum coincides with the mean radial velocity inferred from symmetric
absorptions Vr(abs). At the same time, the position of the full Ba II 6141 ˚A proﬁle barely
changes from date to date and does not correspond to Vr(abs). This behavior can be
explained by the formation of this line in the outer atmospheric layers unaﬀected by
pulsations. For the strong absorptions we additionally measured the positions of the short-
wavelength, Vr(blue), and long-wavelength, Vr(red), components as well as the position
of the emission peak between them Vr(emis). The results of our Vr measurements from
these components and their errors are given in Table 2, columns 2–4, whence we conclude
that the radial velocities in columns 2–4 measured with a high accuracy are constant with
time. It follows from the constant positions of the emission features that they are formed
in the envelope regions that are external with respect to the supergiant atmosphere.

We have already noted above that the neutral hydrogen line proﬁle is an absorption
without any clear peculiarities expected for a G-type supergiant. However, as follows
from Table 2, the position of the Hα core systematically diﬀers from the expected one
corresponding to the mean radial velocity Vr(abs) for the corresponding date. A possible
explanation of the Hα position in the spectrum is suggested by Fig. 1, where an asymmetry
of the line core apparently attributable to the inﬂuence of an aspherical envelope is clearly
seen for all three times of observations. Evidence for asphericity of the V1027 Cyg enve-
lope also follows from the high degree of polarization (P = 7.7%) that was determined by
Trammell et al. (1994) from spectropolarimetric observations. Subsequently, having per-
formed multicolor polarimetric photometry, Parthasarathy et al. (2006) obtained a degree
of polarization ≈ 1%.

In the far red region of the spectrum for V1027 Cyg we identiﬁed CN molecular lines.
A fragment of the spectrum in the region 7960–8000 ˚A containing many weak lines (with
depths 10–15% below the continuum level) is presented in Fig. 6. We took the wavelengths
for the CN features from the VALD database. The coincidence of the radial velocities
measured from symmetric metal absorptions and CN lines points to the formation of the
CN spectrum in the atmosphere of V1027 Cyg, which is natural for such a cool star.

Interstellar Features and the Systemic Velocity Problem

Apart from the numerous absorptions forming in the supergiant atmosphere, we detected
at least ten weak absorptions in each spectrum of V1027 Cyg whose positions allowed them
to be identiﬁed with DIBs. Table 1 gives the mean velocities corresponding to the positions
of these features. Given the results of Vallee (2008), the velocity averaged over three
spectra, Vr(DIBs) =−12.0 km/s, corresponds to the velocity of the interstellar medium in
the Local Arm of the Galaxy.

Consider in more detail Fig. 5, where the Na I and K I 7696 ˚A line proﬁles are
compared and the mean velocities inferred from numerous symmetric absorptions,
Vr(abs) = 4.5 km/s, and DIBs, Vr(DIB) =−12.9 km/s, for a given date of observations
are indicated. Here, it can be seen that apart from the photospheric and interstellar
(Vr(IS) =−12.0 km/s) components, the broad NaI D line proﬁle apparently contains the
circumstellar and additional interstellar components (Vr≤ −17.0 km/s) that are not sepa-
rated at the spectral resolution of the NES spectrograph. The interstellar components
of these lines merge together to form a broad absorption in the velocity range from

Klochkova et al.: The optical spectrum of the variable V1027 Cyg

Vr≈ −17.0 to Vr≈ −33.0 km/s. The longestwavelength component with Vr ≈ −12.0 km/s,
just as the DIBs, is formed in the Local Arm of the Galaxy (Vallee 2006). As follows from
Fig. 5 and the data in the last column of Table 1, the position of the absorption compo-
nent of the K I 7696 ˚A line with Vr≈ −12 km/s is consistent with the DIB positions. This
coincidence may point to an interstellar formation of the K I absorption component. The
presence of a short–wavelength component with Vr≈ −33.0 km/s, which, according to
Vallee (2006), corresponds to the velocities in the Perseus arm, points to a more distant
position of the star. We emphasize that Kipper and Klochkova (2006) revealed the same
interstellar velocity components (Vr≈ −12.0 and −33.0 km/s) in the spectrum of the faint
star that is the optical counterpart of the IR source IRAS 20000+3239 with Galactic co-
ordinates close to those of V1027 Cyg: l/b ≈ 69/01 and 67/00 for IRAS 20000+3239 and
V1027 Cyg, respectively.

curve) line proﬁles in the April 28, 2015 spectrum of V1027 Cyg. The arrows indicate
the velocities in the spectrum for this date from Table 2 estimated from symmetric photo-
spheric absorptions and DIBs: Vr(abs) = 4.5 km/s and Vr(DIB)=−12.9 km/s, respectively.

The absence of information about the star systemic velocity prevents us from unam-
biguously interpreting the pattern of radial velocities in the atmosphere and envelope of

10

V1027 Cyg. There is no information about the detection of molecular or maser emission in
the published data on radio spectroscopy for IRAS 20004+2955 (Eder et al. 1987; Lewis
et al 1987; Bujarrabal et al. 1992). In the absence of such data, as the systemic veloc-
ity of V1027 Cyg we may take Vsys≈ 5.5 km/s, which is the value of Vr averaged over
all the emissions we detected: in the cores of the strong metal lines from Table 2 and
Ve(7696) = 6.1 km/s from the emission in the K I 7696 ˚A line.

All of the available Vr measurements based on the atmospheric absorptions from Table 2
with those published previously by Klochkova et al. (2000a) fall within the narrow range
−4.1 ÷ 10.3 km/s. The adopted systemic velocity Vsys = 5.5 km/s leads to the tentative
conclusion about a small radial velocity amplitude attributable to pulsations. Recall that
Arkhipova et al. (1997) obtained a wider range of values, Vr =−10 ÷ +20 km/s, from
low-resolution spectra.

4. Discussion

Anomalous proﬁles of strong absorptions (Si II, Ni I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, Cr I, Fe I, Fe II, Ba II)
have been detected in the spectrum of V1027 Cyg for the ﬁrst time. Our measurements of
the positions of individual features in these absorptions allow the proﬁles of these lines to
be considered as a single broad absorption whose position does not correspond to Vr(abs)
and does not change from date to date. This discrepancy between the velocities inferred
from strong and weak absorptions can be explained by the fact that the strong absorptions
are formed in the outer layers of the extended atmosphere unaﬀected by pulsations. Stable
weak emissions are observed in the cores of all the strongest absorptions. The mean
velocity of these emissions, in the absence of radio spectroscopic data for the IR source
IRAS 20004+2955, may be considered as the systemic velocity Vsys = 5.5 km/s.

Similar peculiarities of the spectrum are observed in R Sct, an RV Tau variable star,
whose evolutionary status is close to the evolutionary stage of V1027 Cyg. For example,
Kipper and Klochkova (2013) pointed out a splitting of the strongest absorptions in the
spectrum of R Sct and the presence of a weak and variable emission in Fe I and Ti I lines.
However, as has been noted above, in contrast to V1027 Cyg, the spectrum of R Sct near
minimum light exhibits an emission in Hα and Hβ as well.

Line doubling is a fairly common phenomenon observed in the spectra of variable stars of
various types. The propagation of a shock wave is a universally accepted cause of the dou-
ble absorption lines in the spectra of pulsating stars (for the details of this Schwarzschild
scenario, see Alvarez et al. 2000). The line doubling in the spectra for an extensive sample
of Mira variables was investigated by Alvarez et al. (2001). One of the most important
results of their publication is that there is no visual-amplitude threshold beyond which
line doubling only would occur in small-amplitude stars.

Recall that doubling or asymmetry of strong absorptions were detected in the spectra of
a small group of selected post-AGB stars. In contrast to V1027 Cyg, the atmospheres of all
stars from this sample are enriched with carbon and heavy metals. In particular, through
a spectroscopic monitoring with a high spectral resolution Klochkova (2013) detected a
splitting of strong absorptions with a low lowerlevel excitation potential in the spectrum
of the post-AGB supergiant V5112 Sgr for the ﬁrst time. Invoking the radio spectroscopic
data for the associated IR source IRAS 19500−1709 led to the conclusion that the short-

identiﬁed strongest (within this fragment) metal absorptions are also indicated.

wavelength components of the split absorptions are formed in a structured circumstellar
envelope. Thus, evidence for an eﬃcient dredge-up of the heavy metals produced during
the preceding evolution of this star into the envelope was obtained. A similar eﬀect was
detected (Klochkova et al. 2015) in the spectrum of the optically faint star associated
with the IR source IRAS 23304+6147, with large overabundances of carbon and heavy
metals having been revealed in its atmosphere (Klochkova et al. 2000b). The general
properties of a sample of post-AGB supergiants with a splitting of strong absorptions
are summarized in Klochkova and Panchuk (2016), where it was shown that the type of
proﬁles for strong absorptions could be connected with the morphology of the envelope
and with its kinematic and chemical properties.

However, despite the fact that the anomalies of the proﬁles of strong absorptions in the
spectra of the mentioned post-AGB stars and V1027 Cyg are similar in appearance, we
reached the tentative conclusion that the causes of the proﬁle distortion in the spectra of
these objects are diﬀerent. In the spectra of post-AGB stars at least one of the components
of the split absorptions is formed in the envelope detached from the central star. In
contrast, in the case of V1027 Cyg, the strong absorptions with split cores are formed in
the upper layers of the extended stellar atmosphere. Their positions are, on the whole,
stable; the pulsations manifest themselves as a weak variability of the short-wavelength
wings. Thus, the kinematics in the atmosphere of V1027 Cyg can be said to be stratiﬁed:
small-amplitude pulsations are observed in deep layers of the stellar atmosphere, while the
upper atmospheric layers are stable. Using their IR observations with the VLT, Lagadec

Klochkova et al.: The optical spectrum of the variable V1027 Cyg

et al. (2011) studied the images for a large sample of supergiants and showed the image
of V1027 Cyg to be point-like; the circumstellar dust envelope is not resolved.

The DIB positions, Vr(DIBs) =−12.0 km/s, correspond to the velocity of the interstellar
medium in the Local Arm of the Galaxy (Georgelin and Georgelin 1970). Using the
adopted systemic velocity Vsys≈ 5.5 km/s (LSR≈ 23 km/s) and the data from Brand and
Blitz (1993) on the velocity ﬁeld in the Galaxy, we can estimate the distance to the star,
d = 3.9 kpc. This estimate agrees well with the distance to V1027 Cyg that Bogdanov and
Taranova (2009) obtained by an independent method.

The IR spectrum of V1027 Cyg = IRAS 20004+2955 exhibits a strong emission at 10 µ
identiﬁed with silicates in the stellar envelope. This emission, which is typical of the spec-
tra of O-rich stars, served to Hrivnak et al. (1989) as a basis to consider IRAS 20004+2955
to be an analog of the well-studied source IRAS 18095+2704. However, the central
stars of these IR sources diﬀer in metallicity. For the central star of IRAS 18095+2704
[Fe/H] =−0.8 ÷ −0.9, according to Klochkova (1995) and Sahin et al. (2011), respectively,
while in the atmosphere of V1027 Cyg, as Klochkova et al. (2000a) showed, the metallicity
is nearly solar: [Fe/H] =−0.2. The high metallicity of V1027 Cyg and its location close to
the Galactic plane suggest that this star belongs to the disk population.

We think the central star of the IR source IRAS 20508+2011 already mentioned in
the text to be a closer relative for V1027 Cyg. The parameters of this star derived by
Klochkova et al. (2006) (its luminosity Mv≈ −3 mag, eﬀective temperature Teﬀ = 4800 K,
surface gravity log g = 1.5, metallicity [Fe/H] =−0.36, and chemical composition in whole)
are typical of an AGB star. The ratio of the carbon and oxygen overabundances allows
IRAS 20508+2011 to be assigned to the group of evolved stars with oxygen enriched
atmospheres ([O/C] =+0.9), which is consistent with the object position on the IR color-
color diagram. No overabundance of s-process elements was detected, just as in V1027 Cyg.
Since as yet there are no observations in water maser and OH bands for IRAS 20508+2011,
we cannot unambiguously classify the envelope. However, it can be asserted that in the
case of IRAS 20508+2011 we observe an extremely early PPN formation phase that comes
immediately after the termination of mass loss and apparently until the beginning of
envelope separation.

As has already been noted by Klochkova et al. (2000a), the set of main parameters of
V1027 Cyg (the location of this star close to the Galactic plane, its nearly solar metal-
licity, and the atmospheric abundances of chemical elements) more likely corresponds to
a classical supergiant, especially since the intensity of the O I λ7771 − 7775 ˚A triplet,
which served as a universally accepted luminosity indicator, is very high in the spec-
trum of this star. The total equivalent width of the triplet in the spectrum of V1027 Cyg
is W(7773) = 1.86 ˚A. Applying the Mv–W(7773) calibrations published by Klochkova et
al. (2002) and Arellano Ferro et al. (2003), we obtain the luminosity Mv =−8.0 mag for
V1027 Cyg, which is considerably higher than the luminosity of AGB stars but agrees well
with luminosity class Ia. However, we should keep in mind the possible error in the lumi-
nosity due to the application of the Mv–W(7773) calibration obtained from Cepheids and
other massive A–G supergiants of the Galactic disk to a star with an unclear evolutionary
status and the neglect of possible diﬀerences in oxygen abundance.

Taking the luminosity of the star to be Mv =−8.0 mag and the color excess to be
E(B−V) = 0.6 mag (Arkhipova et al. 2000), we estimate the distance to V1027 Cyg to

Klochkova et al.: The optical spectrum of the variable V1027 Cyg

be d≈ 7.5 kpc, which exceeds considerably the distance d = 3.9 kpc corresponding to the
systemic velocity of the star we adopted. The unreliability of the color excess and systemic
velocity estimates is responsible for the discrepancy. For example, if we use the interstellar
reddening Av = 3.6 mag estimated by Hrivnak et al. (1989) for V1027 Cyg by modeling
the ﬂux in the wide wavelength range 0.4–100 µ, then we will obtain d≈4.0 kpc. This value
agrees well with the distance inferred from the systemic velocity.

To reﬁne our conclusions about the star V1027 Cyg, we need its spectroscopic moni-
toring with an ultrahigh spectral resolution (R≥ 105) that will ensure the separation of
the components of the Na I D and K I 7696 ˚A line proﬁles, the reﬁnement of the proposed
velocity pattern, and, consequently, the reﬁnement of the distance to the star and its
evolutionary status.

5. Conclusions

Based on our high-spectral-resolution observations performed with the NES echelle spec-
trograph of the 6-m telescope, we detected the peculiarities of the spectrum and the
velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere of the cool supergiant V1027 Cyg, the optical counterpart
of the IR source IRAS 20004+2955. Small variations of the radial velocity Vr(abs) with
an amplitude of about 5 km/s due to pulsations were revealed by symmetric low- and
moderate-intensity absorptions.

Numerous weak CN molecular lines and the K I 7696 ˚A line with a P Cyg proﬁle were
identiﬁed in the red spectral region. The coincidence of the radial velocities measured from
symmetric metal absorptions and CN lines suggests that the CN spectrum is formed in the
stellar atmosphere. We identiﬁed also numerous diﬀuse interstellar bands whose positions
in the spectrum, Vr(DIBs) =−12.0 km/s, correspond to the velocity of the interstellar
medium in the Local Arm of the Galaxy.

A long-wavelength and time-variable shift of the Hα proﬁle due to line core and short-
wavelength wing distortion is observed in the spectrum of V1027 Cyg. A splitting of the
cores of the strongest absorptions of metals and their ions (Si II, Ni I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II,
Cr I, Fe I, Fe II, Ba II) has been detected in the stellar spectrum for the ﬁrst time. The
broad proﬁle of these lines contains a stable weak emission in the core whose position may
be considered as the systematic velocity Vsys = 5.5 km/s. Spectroscopy with an ultrahigh
spectral resolution is needed for a more deﬁnite interpretation of the radial velocity pat-
tern, for identifying the circumstellar and photospheric components in the Na I D line
proﬁle, and, consequently, for reﬁning the distance to the star and its evolutionary status.
