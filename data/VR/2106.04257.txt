Locomotion is one of the most essential interaction tasks in virtual reality (VR) with teleportation being widely accepted as the

state-of-the-art locomotion technique at the time of this writing. A major draw-back of teleportation is the accompanying physical

rotation that is necessary to adjust the users’ orientation either before or after teleportation. This is a limiting factor for tethered

head-mounted displays (HMDs) and static body postures and can induce additional simulator sickness for HMDs with three degrees-

of-freedom (DOF) due to missing parallax cues. To avoid physical rotation, previous work proposed discrete rotation at ﬁxed intervals

(InPlace) as a controller-based technique with low simulator sickness, yet the impact of varying intervals on spatial disorientation,

user presence and performance remains to be explored. An unevaluated technique found in commercial VR games is reorientation

during the teleportation process (TeleTurn), which prevents physical rotation but potentially increases interaction time due to its con-

tinuous orientation selection. In an exploratory user study, where participants were free to apply both techniques, we evaluated the

impact of rotation parameters of either technique on user performance and preference. Our results indicate that discrete InPlace rota-

tion introduced no signiﬁcant spatial disorientation, while user presence scores were increased. Discrete TeleTurn and teleportation

without rotation was ranked higher and achieved a higher presence score than continuous TeleTurn, which is the current state-of-

the-art found in VR games. Based on observations, that participants avoided TeleTurn rotation when discrete InPlace rotation was

available, we distilled guidelines for designing teleportation without physical rotation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Wolf et al.

Virtual reality oﬀers its users a potentially unlimited space to explore. Navigating this vast environment is a non trivial

task and has been the focus of a large body of related work. Although walking in VR has been shown to be superior

to walk-in-place and controller-based techniques [41], spatial restrictions set limits to how far a user can walk in a

straight line. To circumvent these restrictions, researchers propose to manipulate the virtual output presented to users

redirecting them on a curved path (redirected walking with curvature gain) [28]. However, the large radius required

to trick the users’ perception renders a naive implementation of this technique unpractical for daily application [31].

These limitations amongst others led to the rise of a seemingly “unnatural” and yet very eﬃcient locomotion technique:

teleportation (e.g., [7]). By simply pointing and pressing a button users can teleport to their destination in an instant.

This technique allows to overcome spatial restrictions of a small tracking space and has been shown to induce less

simulator sickness than controller-based continuous locomotion [13].

A major drawback of state-of-the-art teleportation is a missing rotation component. Considering the tethered design

of many commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs), users could get entangled by the cables during physical rotation.

Furthermore, physical rotation might not be feasible (e.g., due to a physical impairment) or desirable depending on the

context (e.g., during a sitting or lying body posture). In addition, the optical ﬂow during physical rotation can cause

a feeling of vection, i.e., the illusion of moving, and thus, induce simulator sickness [29]. Especially low-class HMDs

with only three degrees-of-freedom (DoF) are missing important parallax cues, which are necessary to compensate for

postural changes during a physical rotation. The result is a mismatch between virtual and physical motion, which can

induce simulator sickness and reduce the user experience [43].

In an eﬀort to extend teleportation-based locomotion by a rotation component, we identiﬁed two promising oppor-

tunities: rotation around the users’ position (henceforth “InPlace”) and rotation around the desired teleportation target
(henceforth “TeleTurn”), which can be found in commercial VR games (e.g., Robo Recall 1).

To prevent any physical rotation, Sargunam et al. compared controller-based rotation techniques (InPlace) in terms

of simulator sickness and disorientation and found discrete rotations at ﬁxed intervals to induce the least simulator
sickness [36]. While they suggested an interval of 30◦, this value stems from a preliminary study with no evaluation
of the impact on user presence, disorientation, and preference.

A commercially available, yet underexplored rotation technique is reorientation during the teleportation process

(TeleTurn). While selecting a teleportation destination, users can choose the new orientation that the user avatar should

assume at the new destination point. This new orientation is typically selected via a continuous gesture on a joystick

or touchpad and is displayed as an abstract arrow (see Figure 1 c) or the users’ avatar. However, a continuous gesture

for orientation selection has been shown to slow down the interaction and reduce user acceptance of this technique [7].

We are therefore interested in exploring the potential of a discrete version of TeleTurn to reduce interaction time and

increase the overall usability. Furthermore, it is unclear how users would apply InPlace and TeleTurn if both techniques

are made available for direct comparison.

Results of our exploratory user study (N=12) indicate that users preferred discrete InPlace rotation over discrete
TeleTurn with the largest rotation parameter (45◦) being the favorite. However, discrete TeleTurn rotation showed an
improvement over the current state-of-the-art, which is a continuous gesture for orientation selection.

Our contributions are therefore:

and TeleTurn rotation

2 RELATED WORK

2.1 Locomotion in VR

To navigate through virtual environments (VEs), previous work proposed upper-body leaning [24] and several joystick-

and keyboard-based locomotion techniques (e.g., [5, 33]). However, physical movement through VEs has been largely

shown to provide a better sense of orientation [10], target direction [42], and feeling of presence [41] even with a

moderate level of visual detail [32].

Due to spatial limitations of the tracking space, variations of physical walking were proposed. While some ap-

proaches included treadmills (e.g., [4]), walking-in-place [38, 40, 46] or jumping-in-place [48] to prevent users from

reaching the physical boundaries of their tracking space, other techniques tried to “trick” the users’ perception by

using manipulations without being recognized [39]. Since visual calibration has been shown to occur when the pre-

sented self-speed was manipulated [21], Williams et al. increased the users’ reach by scaling the translational gain, i.e.,

the users’ velocity [44]. In a follow-up study, Williams et al. extended this technique by “resetting” the users’ orienta-

tion when a physical boundary was reached, therefore forcing the users to physically reorient themselves towards the

tracking space [45]. Another variation of visual manipulation is redirected walking where users are nudged to walk on

a circular path by virtually rotating their view (e.g.,[28]). This technique, however, has been shown to be impractical

in its naive implementation since the required walking radius would exceed the size of a typical tracking space [31].

To circumvent this limitation, resetting techniques and alternative approaches to substitute physical turns to keep the

user within a limited physical space were proposed (e.g. [30]).

Another well-explored locomotion technique is teleportation. According to the classiﬁcation of locomotion tech-

niques for VR by LaViola et al., teleportation is a selection-based travel technique [18]. The users’ viewpoint is instantly

shifted to the destination that the user is pointing or looking at to prevent optical ﬂow and the possibly accompanying

motion sickness (e.g., [3, 8]). While some variants of teleportation limit the users to ﬁxed teleportation destinations

(i.e., ﬁx-point teleportation), studies have shown that free teleportation leads to a lower discomfort [13]. Although

teleportation can lead to disorientation [2, 6], it was subjectively preferred over joystick input in a study by Langbehn

et al. in 2018 [17].

2.2 Rotation in VR

Physical rotation in VEs has been shown to be less time consuming [25] and less error prone than controller-based

rotation [1]. A study by Ruddle and Péruch, however, reported contradicting ﬁndings regarding the sense of direction

when they compared physical and non-physical rotation in VEs [34]. Since physical rotation can be impractical due to

a static body posture or tethering [36], there have been approaches to reduce or prevent physical rotation completely.

Similar to translational gains by Williams et al. [44], Kuhl et al. proposed to scale the users’ physical rotation, therefore

reducing the physical rotation needed for a full turn [16]. This approach could be a beneﬁt for setups with very limited

tracking space (e.g., frontal tracking as used by the Oculus Rift CV1) or when tethering is an issue. Alternatively, Lin

et al. propose to apply a smaller ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) to reduce simulator sickness at the cost of user presence [19].

To combat this limitation and allow movement in a stationary position, Fernandes and Feiner suggest subtle dynamic

changes in the users’ FOV [11]. However, a study by Sargunam et al. compared controller-based rotation techniques to

4

Wolf et al.

prevent physical rotation and found that discrete rotation induced signiﬁcantly less simulator sickness than reduced

ﬁeld-of-view and continuous rotation techniques [36]. Since a frame of reference (usually egocentric) and landmarks

are very important for the users’ orientation in VEs [12, 22, 23], the question arises how large these discrete rotation
intervals can become until users become disoriented. A study by Rahimi et al. applied discrete rotation between 45◦
and 130◦ without a signiﬁcant increase in disorientation, however no evaluation of the eﬀect of rotation magnitude
was performed due to the randomized design of the experiment [27]. The underexplored impact of varying rotation

parameters on user performance and presence led us to investigate a range of discrete rotation angles in a user study.

3 USER EXPERIMENT

To evaluate how varying rotation parameters of the techniques InPlace and TeleTurn impact user performance, presence,
and simulator sickness, a repeated measures 3 × 4 factorial design study was conducted. Rotation parameters included

discrete rotation and the respective state-of-the-art for each technique.

3.1 Method

Our within-subject experiment had two rotation techniques as independent variables: InPlace and TeleTurn. Both tech-

niques were available in each condition and participants were free to choose one or alternate between them.

Rotation around the participants’ position was deﬁned by InPlace and had three levels: physical rotation (Physical),
representing the current state-of-the-art, and two levels of discrete, button-based rotation at ﬁxed angles (22.5◦ and
45◦). Rotation during the teleportation process was deﬁned by TeleTurn and had four levels: no rotation (None), which
represents state-of-the-art teleportation from related work, Continuous rotation via circling the thumb on a touchpad,

which is state-of-the-art in commercial VR games, and two levels of discrete, button-based rotation at ﬁxed angles
(22.5◦ and 45◦). The currently selected direction is indicated via a visual indicator (see Figure 1 c). Our experiment
therefore consisted of 3 × 4 = 12 conditions that were fully counter-balanced.

3.2 Implementation

To explore the potential of controller-based discrete rotation, the study environment for the experiment was imple-

mented for the Oculus Go HMD and its three DOF controller in Unity3D. Holding down the trigger button activated

a teleportation parabola, releasing the button executed the teleportation to the selected destination point. For consis-

tency, discrete rotation for both, InPlace rotations (i.e., yaw axis rotations around the users’ position) and TeleTurn (i.e.,

rotations during the teleportation process) was controlled by pressing either on the left or right side of the touchpad

to initiate a rotation to the left or right, respectively. The angle of discrete rotation depended on the condition (either
22.5◦ or 45◦). Only during the Continuous TeleTurn condition, the relative position of the users’ thumb on the touchpad
deﬁned the angle. Similar to previous work, we opted for fractions of 90◦ to allow fast 90◦ rotations that were necessary
to navigate an environment with orthogonal walls such as our labyrinth (see Figure 1 a). The complexity of our level

design was inspired by previous work. It has been shown that while a rotation oriented within-subject experiment

requires an environment that enforces repeated rotations, a lack of complexity (e.g., simple rooms) leads to learning

eﬀects [26, 35].

3.3 Participants

We recruited 12 volunteers (6 male, 6 female) from our institution with a mean age of 22.75 (SD=2.38). All partici-

pants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Five reported previous VR experience and all but one reported to use

physical rotation in VR instead of controller-based techniques.

3.4 Measures

After each condition, participants were asked to ﬁll out questionnaires assessing their experience. Aﬀective state was

measured as valence, arousal, and dominance using the three 5-point pictorial scales of the the self-assessment manikin

(SAM) [9]. Simulator sickness was assessed with the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ [15], 16 items on a 4-point

scale), while presence was measured with the igroup presence questionnaire (IPQ [37], 14 items on a 7-point scale).

Objective measures logged during each condition were the number of teleportations, the number of rotations, the

duration of teleportations (i.e., the time required to initiate and complete a teleportation including TeleTurn rotation),

and the score achieved (number of items collected). In a ﬁnal questionnaire, participants were asked to rank all 12

conditions by preference and provide general comments.

3.5 Procedure

After an introduction, participants completed informed consent forms and provided information on their demographic

background, including their VR experience. Afterwards, participants were explained the functionality of the HMD and

the controller and had the opportunity to try the diﬀerent rotation techniques. In each of the 12 conditions, participants

were asked to navigate through a labyrinth via teleportation and collect as many items as possible within two minutes

(see Figure 1 b). In each condition, participants started at the center of the labyrinth. Items were spawned in a semi-

random manner with equal diﬃculty. To estimate the users’ disorientation, they were asked to return to the center of

the labyrinth after each collected item, thereby gaining a score. Afterwards, they had to ﬁll out the questionnaires and

were asked to take a break to reduce carry-over eﬀects of simulator sickness. All conditions were counter-balanced

and only during conditions where InPlace was set to Physical participants were allowed to rotate physically, other-

wise rotation was performed via the controller. After the last condition, participants were asked to ﬁll out the ﬁnal

questionnaire including a ranking of the conditions and general comments. Each participant received ﬁve currency

(anonymized for review) of compensation at the end of the experiment.

3.6 Results

Due to the non-normal distribution of the collected data and multi-factorial design of the experiment, analysis was

performed with the Aligned Rank Transform by Wobbrock et al. with Bonferonni correction for pairwise compar-

isons [47]. For readability’s sake, descriptive statistics are presented in tables 1 to 4. For clarity of presentation, only

signiﬁcant main eﬀects and interactions will be reported below.

3.6.1 Presence. IPQ Total Score: There was a main eﬀect for InPlace (𝐹2,22 = 3.642, p=.029) and TeleTurn (𝐹3,33 =
5.913, p<.001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of InPlace revealed that 45◦ (M=3.76, SE=0.17) was signiﬁcantly higher
than Physical (p=.023, M=3.52, SE=0.18). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of TeleTurn showed that None (M=3.91, SE=0.23)
was signiﬁcantly higher than 22.5◦ (p=.003, M=3.50, SE=0.16) and 45◦ (p=.002, M=3.54, SE=0.21).

Table 4. Descriptive statistics by condition for the number of teleportations (Teleport), duration of teleportation (in ms), number of
discrete rotations in place (𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝐼 𝑃 ), and number of discrete rotations during teleportations (𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑇 𝑇 ).

3.6.4 Number of Teleportations. There was a main eﬀect for TeleTurn (𝐹3,33 = 9.774, p<.001). Post-hoc pairwise compar-
isons of TeleTurn revealed that None (M=88.36, SE=9.69) was signiﬁcantly higher than 22.5◦ (p<.001, M=67.89, SE=8.81),
45◦ (p<.001, M=66.50, SE=6.17), and Continuous (p<.001, M=64.39, SE=6.13).

3.6.5 Duration of Teleportation. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA with

Greenhouse-Geisser correction revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect for InPlace on the participants’ teleportation duration
(F (1.30,14.25) = 9.56, p=.005, 𝜂2
𝑝=.47, 𝜖=.648). Pairwise t-tests with Bonferonni correction revealed that the duration of
teleportation was signiﬁcantly higher in the InPlace Physical condition than in the InPlace 45◦ condition (p<.001). In ad-
dition, there was a signiﬁcant main eﬀect for TeleTurn (F (1.71,18.83) = 11.57, p=.001, 𝜂2
𝑝=.51, 𝜖=.571). Pairwise t-tests with
Bonferonni correction revealed that the duration of teleportations was signiﬁcantly lower in the TeleTurn None condi-
tion than in the TeleTurn Continuous (p=.001), TeleTurn 22.5◦ (p=.005), and TeleTurn 45◦ condition (p=.001). Furthermore,
there was a signiﬁcant interaction between InPlace and TeleTurn (F (2.61,28.75) = 4.80, p=.010, 𝜂2
𝑝=.30, 𝜖=.436). While tele-
portation duration was mostly unaﬀected by the InPlace level during TeleTurn None conditions, teleportation duration
in the TeleTurn 22.5◦ and TeleTurn 45◦ conditions was lowest with InPlace levels at 45◦.

3.6.6 Number of Discrete Rotations. Rotations were divided into rotations that happened in place, i.e. around the
participants’ position, (𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝐼𝑃 ) and rotations during teleportation, i.e. rotating the indicator arrow during tele-
portation, (𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑇𝑇 , see Figure 1 c). A Wilcoxon Signed Rank test revealed that the 𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝐼𝑃 ranks for the
InPlace 22.5◦ condition (mean rank = 27.04) were signiﬁcantly higher than in the InPlace 45◦ condition (mean rank =
23.46, Z=-2.15, p=.032). Median (IQR) 𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝐼𝑃 levels for the InPlace 22.5◦ and InPlace 45◦ condition were 127.00
(81.50 to 163.00) and 117.50 (78.50 to 139.00), respectively.

A Friedman’s ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the 𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑇𝑇 values for the three TeleTurn conditions
TeleTurn Continuous, TeleTurn 22.5◦, and TeleTurn 45◦ (X 2(2)=9.31, p=.009). Median (IQR) 𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝐼𝑃 levels for the

Augmenting Teleportation in Virtual Reality With Discrete Rotation Angles

TeleTurn Continuous, TeleTurn 22.5◦, and TeleTurn 45◦ conditions were 16.00 (7.25 to 32.00), 58.50 (1.50 to 112.75), and
43.50 (1.00 to 82.50), respectively. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were performed with a Bonferonni adjusted p-value
of .017. 𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑇𝑇 ranks were signiﬁcantly higher in the TeleTurn 22.5◦ condition (mean rank = 22.78) than in the
TeleTurn Continuous condition (mean rank = 8.77, Z=-3.12, p<.001) and 𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑇𝑇 ranks were signiﬁcantly higher
in the TeleTurn 22.5◦ condition (mean rank = 18.59) than in the TeleTurn 45◦ condition (mean rank = 11.17, Z=-3.06,
p=.002). Furthermore, 𝑅𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑇𝑇 ranks were signiﬁcantly higher in the TeleTurn 45◦ condition (mean rank = 24.07)
than in the TeleTurn Continuous condition (mean rank = 9.75, Z=-3.09, p=.002).

3.6.7 Participant Score. There was a main eﬀect for InPlace (𝐹2,22 = 4.188, p=.017) and TeleTurn (𝐹3,33 = 5.306, p=.002).
Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of InPlace revealed that 45◦ (M=3.00, SE=0.30) was signiﬁcantly higher than Physi-
cal (p=.013, M=2.23, SE=0.26). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of TeleTurn revealed that None (M=3.47, SE=0.45) was
signiﬁcantly higher than Continuous (p<.001, M=1.92, SE=0.24). On average, the Physical None condition achieved the
highest and the Physical Continuous condition the lowest score (see Figure 2).

3.6.8 Ranking of Conditions. There was a main eﬀect for InPlace
(𝐹2,22 = 42.439, p<.001) and TeleTurn (𝐹3,33 = 9.452, p<.001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of InPlace revealed that
45◦ (M=8.38, SE=0.35) was signiﬁcantly higher than 22.5◦ (p=.047, M=7.23, SE=0.34) and Physical (p<.001, M=3.90,
SE=0.30). Furthermore, 22.5◦was signiﬁcantly higher than Physical (p<.001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of Tele-
Turn revealed that None (M=8.17,
SE=0.69) was signiﬁcantly higher than 22.5◦ (p=.043, M=6.25, SE=0.36) and Continuous (p<.001, M=4.81, SE=0.60). Fur-
thermore, 45◦ was signiﬁcantly higher than Continuous (p=.002). On average, the 45◦ 22.5◦ condition achieved the
highest rank, while the Physical Continuous condition achieved the lowest rank (see Figure 2).

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 InPlace

Our results indicate that independent of the rotation interval, participants felt more pleased and in control with discrete
InPlace rotations (i.e., InPlace conditions 22.5◦ and 45◦) than with physical rotation. Even the largest rotation interval
did not aﬀect simulator sickness and spatial disorientation levels. In contrast, participants were able to navigate the

labyrinth more eﬃciently, which is reﬂected in the higher number of collected items. Both discrete InPlace conditions
were preferred over physical rotation, with the highest rotation interval (45◦) being the favorite. Although rotations
at 45◦ were considered “easier” (P7), they were not fast enough for some participants, calling for a “higher rotation
interval” (P4) or the possibility to “hold down the rotation button” (P12). Higher rotation intervals should therefore be

considered in future studies of InPlace rotation.

Implications: Some participants considered repeated button presses for both rotation types as too slow, while others

considered the rotation intervals as too large and imprecise. Depending on the user preference and environment, it

should be possible to adjust the rotation interval similar to adjusting the scrolling speed of a computer mouse.

4.2 TeleTurn

Since TeleTurn is a novel interaction technique included in a limited set of commercial VR games, we included the

None condition, which represents teleportation from related work (e.g., [7]), in addition to the Continuous state-of-

the-art in our user experiment. While participants preferred discrete TeleTurn rotations over the Continuous condition

and felt more pleased and in control, the TeleTurn None condition was superior in terms of interaction time (teleporta-

tion duration) and performance (participant score). This could be explained by the lack of experience regarding Tele-

Turn rotation. P9 considered TeleTurn rotation as “tedious” and preferred a “sequence” of InPlace rotation and straight

teleportation. This is consistent with the number of rotations observed. In conditions with discrete InPlace rotation,

the number of TeleTurn rotations was lower since participants were free to choose between either of the rotation modes.

Augmenting Teleportation in Virtual Reality With Discrete Rotation Angles

11

Implications: Participants mostly preferred rotation around their position (InPlace) over rotations during telepor-

tation (TeleTurn), since the technique was “intuitive to use [...] but diﬃcult to get used to” (P5). While a preview of

the new orientation direction in form of a visual indicator was helpful, some users might beneﬁt from a preview of

the perspective to be assumed in order to see a beneﬁt in TeleTurn over InPlace rotation. Similar to Liu et al., a por-

tal or a video screen ﬂoating next to the user could serve as a medium to achieve this eﬀect [20]. Furthermore, the

TeleTurn condition was new to most participants, suggesting that interaction time could be reduced due to learning

eﬀects, making the technique more eﬃcient. Since the current experimental setup set a time restriction, participants

could have been in favor of the fastest technique. Considering other applications, such as shooters, where teleporting

blindly to a new position might be dangerous, the time needed to select a new orientation via TeleTurn might be put

into a new perspective.

4.3 Summary

Overall, teleportation with physical rotation (Physical None condition), which is the current state-of-the-art of most
VR applications that feature teleportation, achieved the highest ranking score. A combination of 45◦ InPlace rotation
and no TeleTurn rotation (None) achieved the highest score and was the third most preferred condition, oﬀering a

viable alternative for scenarios where physical rotation is impractical or impossible (e.g., sitting or lying). The novel

TeleTurn technique with Continuous rotation in combination with physical InPlace rotation, as it is implemented in

some commercial VR games, achieved the lowest score and was the least preferred condition of our participants. Since
a combination of 45◦ InPlace and 22.5◦ TeleTurn rotation achieved the second highest score and was the second most
preferred condition, we consider that TeleTurn could successfully be improved over its Continuous state-of-the-art and

was well accepted by our participants.

5 LIMITATIONS

The experiment was performed with a three DoF HMD. Nevertheless we argue that the results can also be transferred

to six DOF tracking, since the focus of the study was on rotation and not translation. The small sample size in our

experiment could have been too low to ﬁnd small eﬀects between conditions and we explored only a limited range of

rotation angles that might have been in favor of our game level design. Values beyond the investigated range could yield

other results in terms of simulator sickness and player performance. Furthermore, spatial orientation was measured

via the number of collected items and the respective SSQ subscale. Alternatively, orientation could have been measured

via spatial updating which could result in a diﬀerent outcome [14].

6 CONCLUSION

In this work we investigated the nature and potential of discrete rotation in VR to avoid physical rotation and main-

tain user presence, performance, and prevent simulator sickness. Two rotation techniques, rotation in-place (InPlace)

and rotation during the teleportation process (TeleTurn), were evaluated with ﬁxed rotation intervals against their re-

spective state-of-the-art. Our results indicate that discrete InPlace rotation was preferred over physical rotation and

signiﬁcantly improved user presence and performance. The discrete TeleTurn variation was preferred over continuous

TeleTurn, which is the current state-of-the-art, and led to signiﬁcantly lower disorientation. InPlace rotation was largely

preferred over TeleTurn. As a result, participants adapted a locomotion style that combined discrete InPlace rotations

with straight teleportation without TeleTurn suggesting a complementary usage. From our ﬁndings we conclude that

teleportation without physical rotation is feasible while maintaining user experience and performance.
