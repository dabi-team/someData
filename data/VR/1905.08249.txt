ABSTRACT

We present results of a search for variable stars in a region of the globular cluster NGC 4147 based
on photometric observations with 4K×4K CCD imager mounted at the axial port of the recently
installed 3.6 m Devasthal optical telescope at Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences,
Nainital, India. We performed time series photometry of NGC 4147 in V and R bands, and identiﬁed
42 periodic variables in the region of NGC 4147, 28 of which have been detected for the ﬁrst time.
Seventeen variable stars are located within the half light radius . 0.48 arcmin, of which 10 stars are
newly identiﬁed variables. Two of 10 variables are located within the core radius . 0.09 arcmin.
Based on the location in the V /(V − R) colour magnitude diagram and variability characteristics,
7, 8, 5 and 1 newly identiﬁed probable member variables are classiﬁed as RRc, EA/E, EW and SX
Phe, respectively. The metallicity of NGC 4147 estimated from light curves of RRab and RRc stars
with the help of Fourier decomposition is found to be characteristics of Oosterhoﬀ II. The distance
derived using light curves of RRab stars is consistent with that obtained from the observed V /(V − R)
colour-magnitude diagram.

Keywords: Globular cluster: NGC 4147 – colour–magnitude diagram: Variables: RR Lyrae

1. INTRODUCTION

The study of variable stars in globular clusters has
been carried out by several groups using diﬀerent meth-
ods and techniques (e.g., Clement et al. 2001, Pritzl et
al. 2002, Layden et al. 2003, Clementini et al. 2005,
Corwin et al. 2006, Baker et al. 2007 and Kopacki et al.
2008). Globular clusters normally consist of low mass
population II stars and provide an ideal environment
for the search of RR Lyrae stars. The early investiga-
tions of globular clusters show that the more than 90%
of the known variables were of the RR Lyrae type. With
the advent of new technology, other types of variables in
the globular clusters are also discovered. Even after new
discoveries of variables, RR Lyrae stars still dominate

the variability populations in globular clusters. They
now constitute less than 70% of the known variables
(see Clement 2017).

NGC 4147 is a relatively small globular cluster of ra-
dius 0.48 arcmin, which is located at 21 kpc from the
Galactic center and 19 kpc from the Sun and has low
metallicity [F e/H] = -1.83 (Harris 1996; 2010 edition).
The 0.48 arcmin radius given in the Harris catalogue
(Harris 1996; 2010 edition) refers to the half light radius
of the cluster. The core and tidal radii of the cluster
are as 0.09 and 6.1 arcmin, respectively ((Harris 1996;
2010 edition). The reddening towards the cluster NGC
4147 is found to be E(B − V )=0.02 mag (Harris 1996;
2010 edition). Previous studies by Castellani & Quarta
(1987), Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) and Stetson et al.
(2005) have shown that, although NGC 4147 is a rel-
atively metal poor cluster with a predominantly blue

horizontal branch (HB) in its colour-magnitude diagram
(CMD), its RR Lyrae have short periods, characteristic
of more metal rich Oosterhoﬀ type I clusters. Mean-
while, the large proportion of RRc variables is typical of
an Oosterhoﬀ II cluster.

Up to now, the only known variables in NGC 4147 are
RR Lyrae. With much better plate scale and the large
aperture telescope, it should be possible to identify more
RR Lyrae and other variable stars in the crowded cen-
tral region of the globular cluster NGC 4147. Aiming
this, the observations of globular cluster NGC 4147 were
taken using the 4k×4k CCD camera, the ﬁrst light imag-
ing instrument mounted at the axial port of recently
installed 3.6-m Devasthal optical telescope (DOT) at
Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences
(ARIES), Devasthal campus, India (Pandey et al. 2017).
A time series photometry was carried out on 6 nights
from 23 March 2017 to 9 April 2017 in order to search the
photometric variables in the cluster NGC 4147. With
these new observations, we present precision of photom-
etry and compare the present results with the previ-
ously published work. The paper is organised as fol-
lows. In the next section, we present observations and
data reduction. In subsequent sections we present vari-
able identiﬁcation and discuss their association to the
cluster on the basis of V /(V − R) CMD, proper motions
and geometric probabilities. We discuss period determi-
nation of the known and newly detected variable stars
in subsequent section. Finally, we present study on RR
Lyrae variables as well as other variables detected in the
region of the globular cluster NGC 4147.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The CCD observations were carried using 3.6 m DOT
(f/9 Alt-azimuth mounting) at Aryabhatta Research In-
stitute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Devasthal
(Nainital), India. The telescope is equipped with 4k×4k
CCD imager which is mounted in the main port of the
telescope. The CCD imager has a pixel size of 15 µm
and a plate scale of 0.095 arcsec per pixel, covering ap-

proximately 6.23×6.23 arcmin2 ﬁeld of view over the sky.
The observations were taken in the 4×4 binning mode
with 1000 kHz readout. We have made observations in
V and R bands on 6 nights between 2017 March 23 and
April 9. In total, we have collected 339 and 302 frames
in the V and R bands, respectively. The exposure times
vary from 30 to 50 seconds. The FWHM of the ob-
servations varies between ∼ 0.7 to 1.0 arcsec. The sky
brightness was found to be high due to the bright Moon
on two nights. Bias and twilight ﬂats were also taken
along with the target ﬁeld. The log of observations is
given in Table 1.

The pre-processing of the images was performed using
IRAF1. The instrumental magnitudes of the stars were
obtained using the DAOPHOT package (Stetson 1987).
Both aperture and PSF photometry were performed as
PSF photometry gives better results for the crowded re-
gion. For the PSF photometry, we have selected bright
isolated stars across the ﬁeld to construct a character-
istic point-spread function (PSF) for the images. The
PSF photometry of all the sources was obtained using
the ALLSTAR task. Fig. 1 shows the observed ﬁeld of
globular cluster NGC 4147. The data of V and R bands
were merged by matching the coordinates using a radial
matching tolerance of 1 arcsec. We have detected 1057
stars in both V and R bands. DAOMATCH (Stetson
1992) routine of DAOPHOT was used to ﬁnd the trans-
lation, rotation and scaling solutions between diﬀerent
photometry ﬁles, whereas we have used DAOMASTER
(Stetson 1992) to match the point sources. DAOMAS-
TER was also used to remove the eﬀects of frame-to-
frame ﬂux variation due to airmass and exposure time.
This task makes the mean ﬂux level of each frame equal
to the reference frame by an additive constant. The
ﬁrst target image on 25 March 2017 was taken as the
reference frame.

The intensity weighted mean instrumental magnitudes
in V and R bands given by DAOMASTER (Stetson
1992) were transformed into the standard ones using the
photometric data of standard stars marked in the ﬁeld of
NGC 4147 by Arellano Ferro et al. (2004). We have also
used data of few stars taken as standard by Stetson et
al. (2005) to calibrate present instrumental magnitudes.
The following transformation equations were obtained

V = v + (−0.198 ± 0.021) × (V − R) + 4.800 ± 0.022
V − R = (1.036 ± 0.032) × (v − r) − 0.0874 ± 0.019

servatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities

Declination using CCMAP and CCTRAN tasks avail-
able in IRAF. The average photometric error of the data
was estimated using the observations of each star. The
average photometric error of stars along with identiﬁed
variables as a function of standard magnitude in V and

stars which are having photometric error .0.02 mag up
to V ∼ 18 mag. Whereas all the identiﬁed variables, ir-
respective of the photometric errors, are plotted in Fig.

2.1. Comparison with previous photometry

We have compared present photometric results with
the previous photometry given by Stetson et al. (2005)
and Wang et al. (2000). Data have been downloaded
from the Vizier catalog for both previous photometries.
The catalog by Stetson et al. (2005) lists BV data for
91 stars while Wang et al. (2000) presented photometry
for 115 stars. Cross-identiﬁcation yields 79 and 94 com-
mon stars with Stetson et al. (2005) and Wang et al.
(2000), respectively. Fig. 3 shows the diﬀerence ∆ (in
the sense present minus previous photometry) in V and
(V −R) between our photometry and previous photome-
tries. The ﬁlled circles represent the diﬀerence between
present V magnitudes and those by Stetson et al. (2005)
while open circles show the diﬀerence between present
photometry and the photometry by Wang et al. (2000).

Fig. 3 indicates that present V magnitudes match well
with those given by Stetson et al. (2005), whereas com-
parison of present V magnitudes with those obtained by
Wang et al. (2000) indicates fair agreement up to V ∼
16.0 mag. The present V magnitudes become fainter

redder and become even more redder with increase of V
magnitudes.

2.2. Variables identiﬁcation

The corrected instrumental magnitudes of variables
provided by the DAOMASTER were converted into
standard ones by obtaining transformation equations us-
ing standard stars. We have obtained transformation
equations as follows

V = (1.000 ± 0.002) × v + 4.845 ± 0.010
R = (0.998 ± 0.007) × r + 4.797 ± 0.005

The colour term was not used in the above equations
as it is found insigniﬁcant (see also Arellano Ferro et al.
2004). We have identiﬁed variable stars by inspecting
their light curves visually. The light curves of all the
stars were displayed using a code written in IDL and
each of them was visually inspected, and those showed
periodic/regular brightness variation were selected. We
have detected a total of 42 variables in the region of NGC
4147. Among these 42 variables, 28 variables have been
detected for the ﬁrst time and these variables are termed
as newly identiﬁed variables. Stars V20 and V31 could
not be detected in the R band while we could not detect
V12 in the V band. The optical data of variable stars
along with their identiﬁcation numbers are listed in Ta-
ble 2. Column 1 of Table 2 gives the identiﬁcation num-
ber of a variable. We have adopted the same nomencla-
ture for the known variable stars which have been used
by earlier studies (see Stetson et al. 2005). The identi-
ﬁcation numbers for new variable stars are assigned in
continuation of the past work. The positions of identi-
ﬁed variables are shown by the circles in Fig. 1. This
clearly shows that most of the variables identiﬁed in the
present study are found to be located towards the cluster
center. To understand the spatial distribution of iden-
tiﬁed variables in a better way, the radial distance (r)
of each variable is determined by estimating the cluster
center (RA=12h:10m:6.31 and DEC=+18d:32m:33.42s)
and given in Table 2. Two newly identiﬁed variables
V29 and V31 are located within the core radius . 0.09
arcmin. Seventeen variable stars including V29 and 31
are found to be distributed within the half light radius
. 0.48 arcmin, of which 10 stars namely V24, V27, V28,
V29, V30, 31, V32, V33, V35 and V36 are newly identi-
ﬁed variables. Data of all the detected variable stars in
present work is available online. The format of data is
as follows. The ﬁrst, second and third column represent
JD, magnitude and error, respectively.

In order to understand the nature of variable candi-
dates, it is necessary to ﬁnd out their association to the
globular cluster NGC 4147. We have used V /(V − R)
CMD and proper motion to identify probable members
of the cluster as the sample of identiﬁed variables is con-
taminated by the ﬁeld population. The V /(V −R) CMD
of the cluster NGC 4147 discussed in the next section,
clearly reveals contamination due to ﬁeld star popula-
tion.

stars which have large photometric errors > 0.02 mag up
to V ∼ 18 mag. However, we have considered and plot-
ted those variable stars which have photometric errors
> 0.02 mag. In this CMD, we could not plot three stars
namely V12, V20 and V31 as their (V − R) colours were
not available. The V /(V − R) CMD clearly shows a well
deﬁned main-sequence, giant, supergiant, and HB. From
V /(V − R) CMD, we have also noticed that there is no
gap present in the HB. The HB morphology of the clus-
ter was discussed in detail by Stetson et al. (2005), and
they found that NGC 4147 has a predominantly blue
HB which is diﬀerent from Oosterhoﬀ type I globular
clusters.

along with the age and distance modulus by compar-
ing present observations with theoretical models. The
distance modulus (V − MV ) and age of the cluster are
thus obtained as 16.40 mag and 12.58 gyrs, respectively.
The derived age of NGC 4147 is consistent with the
age of other globular clusters. Using distance mod-
ulus the distance to the cluster was calculated to be
17.49 kpc. The value of reddening E(V − R) towards
the cluster region estimated as 0.04 mag which fur-
ther yielded E(B − V ) (= E(V − R)/0.65) reddening
value as 0.06 mag. The metallicity [F e/H] of stars
can be generally calculated using the following relation
[F e/H] = log(Z/X) − log(Z/X)⊙, where Z/X is the
metal to hydrogen ratio (Harris 1996: 2010 Edition),
Smith 1995). The above conversion is used if the ele-
mental distribution is assumed to follow the solar abun-
dances. The metals in stars are often grouped into
two categories: α elements and Fe elements. The old
metal poor stars are typically α enhanced in the halo
and bulge of our Galaxy ([Fe/H] < −0.6 and [α/Fe]
∼0.3-0.4) (e.g. C´aceres & Catelan 2008 and references
therein). Therefore, to determine the relative iron abun-

dance with respect to the solar iron abundance for any
[α/Fe] value we have used the relation given by Val-
carce et al. (2012, 2013). Thus, the value of metallicity
[F e/H] with [α/Fe]=0.3 comes out be −1.47. If we con-
sider the value of [α/Fe]=0.4, the metallicity [F e/H]
comes out to be −1.57.

All the present variable candidates except V44 are
found to be located on the HB, red giant branch and blue
stragglers region, and these could be probable members
of the cluster. Due to lack of R band data the member-
ship of newly identiﬁed variables V20 and V31 can not
be determined.

3.2. Membership probability based on Proper motions

and geometric distribution

The proper motion data by Wang et al. (2000) have
also been used to determine the membership of identi-
ﬁed variables. Wang et al. (2000) have estimated proper
motion of stars having magnitudes B .17.0 mag using
three epoch data. As per their criterion a star having
membership probability ≤0.67 can be regarded as a non-

member by them. Wang et al. (2000) found that there
are quite a few stars with large membership probabil-
ities located above the HB. From their location in the
V /(V − R) CMD of NGC 4147, they suggested the ex-
istence of a second HB, and it might be due to their
binary nature. For the larger dispersion in the member
star sequence Wang et al. (2000) suggested that there
could be crowding problems near the cluster center that
reduced the accuracy of the photometric data.

Present data of variables have been cross-matched
with Wang et al. (2000) data within the 1 arcsec match-
ing radius and 23 stars were found common between
these two data sets. The known variables V2, V3, V4,
V6, V8, V10, V11, V12, V14, V16 and V17 detected in
the present work have membership probabilities ≥ 0.70,
hence these could be the members of the cluster. Wang
et al. (2000) considered V13 as non-member of the clus-
ter as its membership probability has been found to be
0.70. Proper motion data of known variable star V1
is not known. Only 10 newly identiﬁed variables have
proper motion data, of which four stars V24, V31, V37

and V42 have membership probabilities ≥ 0.70. For
stars V20, V23, V28, V32, V33 and V47 membership
probability was found to be either zero or ≤ 0.70. The
proper motions of cross-matched stars along with their
membership probability are listed in Table 3.

We have also used proper motion values of variable
stars taken from Gaia astrometric mission (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2018). The Gaia astrometric mission
has been launched in 2013 to measure positions, paral-
laxes, proper motions and photometry to obtain physical
parameters for millions of stars. There are 36 variable
stars which have proper motion values. For calculation
of membership probabilities using the proper motion
data of these 36 stars, we tried parametric approach
which is commonly used as described in Vasilevskis,
Klemola & Preston (1958). This approach assumes
a normal bivariate distribution for proper motion val-
ues for both ﬁeld and cluster stars. Distribution of
proper motion values for ﬁeld stars around our cluster
followed no standard form and therefore, we used the
non-parametric approach as described in Cabrera-Cano
& Alfaro (1990) through its implementation Clusterix
It iteratively improves
(http://clusterix.cerit-sc.cz/).
empirically determined cluster and ﬁeld stars distribu-
tions, without any assumption about their shape and

also uses positional data as supplementary information.
The proper motion cutoﬀ was set to 10 mas/yr and ra-
dius of the cluster to 6.5 arcmins. Table 3 lists proper
motion data and membership probability of 36 variable
stars. Table 3 shows that all these stars excluding V29
have membership probability more than 80%.

Rozyczka et al. (2017) discussed membership proba-
bilities of the variable stars based on their proper mo-
tions, spatial distribution and CMD location. They al-
low for the fact that stars with proper motion member-
ship probabilities less than 70% might still be cluster
members. In the case of M22, they proposed that if the
proper motion probability of the star is less than 70%,
but if it has geometric probability > 99% with condition
that if the star’s CMD location is appropriate for its
variability type, and its distance from the cluster center
is less than 3.3 arcmin (which is the half light radius for
M22), the star could be a member of the cluster. This
could be situation for V28, V32, V33 and V47 in NGC
4147. These stars are located in the crowded central
region of the cluster within the half light radius .0.48
arcmin, where it might have been diﬃcult to derive accu-
rate proper motions and distances. On the other hand,
V20 and V23 both have membership probabilities less
than 70% and are located much further from the cluster
center. They are probably ﬁeld stars. The geometric
membership probabilities of stars have been calculated
using the relation Pgeom = 1 − πr2/S given by Rozyczka
et al. (2017), where r is the radial distance from the
cluster center in arcsec and S is the size of the ﬁeld of
view in arcsec2. The value of S is taken as 139726.644
arcsec2. The determined geometric membership proba-
bilities of variable stars are listed in Table 3.

To assign membership status of the stars when no
proper motions are available, Rozyczka et al. (2017) sug-
gested another membership criteria based on geometric
probabilities >70%, CMD location and distance from
the cluster center. Using this criteria stars V21, V22,
V25, V26, V27, V29, V30, V34, V35, V36, V38, V39,
V40, V41, V43, and V46 could be probable members of
the cluster. Two stars V26 and V44 which are located
outside the half light radius and have geometric prob-
abilities <70% can be considered as ﬁeld stars. Thus,
the membership status of the each star decided on the
proper motion, CMD location and geometric member-
ship probabilities is given in Table 3. In Table 3, the
member stars are ﬂagged as ‘1’, whereas non-members
as ‘0’.

better periods even if the data are taken at irregular

were folded using these derived periods. The phased
light curves were visually inspected and we opted pe-
riod which gives the best folded light curve. Figs. 5 and

identiﬁed variable stars, respectively. The R band light
curves of variables have been phased with the period ob-
tained from their V band light curves. For better rep-

covered variable stars, we have folded their light curves
with the phase bin of 0.01.

We could not determine the period of star V1 on the
basis of present data due to our short observational base-
line. We have combined present data of star V1 with
that of Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) to determine its pe-
riod. A period of 0.50039 days for V1 was determined us-
ing LS periodogram. There was systematic oﬀset of 0.1
mag between present and Arellano Ferro et al. (2004)
data. We brought present magnitudes to the magnitudes
of Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) by applying the oﬀset.
The same procedure has been adopted in the case of
variables V6, V7 and V12 to determine their periods.
The phased light curves of V1, V6, V7 and V12 in both
V and R bands are plotted in Fig. 7. The periods and
amplitudes in V and R bands of 42 variable stars are
given in Table 2.

5. RR LYRAE VARIABLES

5.1. Known

The present study consists of 14 known variables
which have already been discovered and studied. The
studies of the cluster NGC 4147 by Davis (1917) and
Baade (1930) discovered one and three variable stars, re-
spectively. The photometric study by Sandage & Walker
(1955) reported 10 variable stars in the cluster region.
Newburn (1957) studied variable stars and discovered
three variable candidates. A study on variable stars in
NGC 4147 was presented by Mannino (1957). Clement
(1997) provided a list of 17 RR Lyrae stars in the re-
gion of NGC 4147. Arellano Ferro et al.
(2004) re-
ported results of V and R band CCD photometry of the
known RR Lyrae stars in NGC 4147 and derived signiﬁ-
cantly improved periods and discovered one new variable
V18. The periodicities of most variables were revised
and new ephemerides were calculated by Arellano Ferro
et al.
(2004). They have detected Blazhko eﬀect in
two stars namely V2 and V6 and found three variables
V5, V9 and V15 as non-variables which had been previ-
ously reported as variables. The variable V18 discovered
by them has period of ∼0.49205 days and amplitude of
∼0.15 mag. The physical parameters of RR Lyrae vari-
ables were also estimated by them. Stetson et al. (2005)
presented a detailed study on photometry and astrome-
try of the cluster NGC 4147. They reanalyzed ﬁve expo-
sures of the cluster obtained with WFPC2 on the Hub-
ble Space Telescope and presented calibrated CMDs and
colour-colour diagrams. They also found morphological
properties which were generally consistent with the pre-
vious published works. Star V18 discovered by Arellano
Ferro et al. (2004) was found non variable by Stetson

et al. (2005). They have also detected one new variable
V19 and characterized it as an RR Lyrae star.

The previously known RR Lyrae variables in the
present work have periods in the range from ∼0.26 to
∼0.60 days and their amplitude of brightness variation
in the V band ranges from ∼0.34 to ∼1.17 mag. Their
amplitudes, periods and location in the V /(V −R) CMD
are in agreement with that of RR Lyrae-type stars. The
known RR Lyrae variables have already been classiﬁed
as RRab and RRc type on the basis of their variability
characteristics in earlier works. The RRab variables V1,
V2, V6, and V7 are varying with larger V amplitudes in
the range of ∼1.02 to ∼1.17 mag. The periods of these
RRab stars vary from ∼0.49 to ∼0.61 days. All known
RRc variables namely V3, V4, V8, V10, V11, V14, V16,
and V17 have amplitudes in the range of ∼0.34 to ∼0.71
mag, while their brightness varies with the periods be-
tween ∼0.26 to ∼0.40 days. The periods of cataloged
variables V3, V4, V6, V7 V8, V10, V11, V12, V13, and
V17 are revised and found to be in agreement with previ-
ously determined periods. There are two stars V2, and
V14 whose periods derived using the present data are
diﬀerent from the periods reported in the previous stud-
ies. We could not detect brightness variation in stars
V5, V9, V15, and V18 using present data. This con-
ﬁrms the conclusion reached by Stetson et al. (2005)
and that these stars are no longer considered to be vari-
ables. Star V19 could not be detected in the present
work because it was outside of the present ﬁeld of view.
Now, we would like to discuss those known variables
whose periods, amplitudes and shape of light curves have
been found to be slightly diﬀerent from the previous
studies.

In the case of star V2 the derived period of 0.335070
days from the present data is not consistent with that
of earlier derived period (Arellano Ferro et al. 2004).
Further, the light curve of V2 could not be phased well
with this derived period. The present data was also not
phased well with the period ∼ 0.49 days reported by
Newburn (1957), Mannino (1957), Arellano Ferro et al.
(2004) and Stetson et al. (2005). The LS power spec-
trum of V2 is shown in Fig. 8(a), where the prominent
peak corresponds to a period of 0.335070 days, however
a period of ∼0.49 days is also present in the data. We
have made a comparison between power spectrum ob-
tained using present data and that obtained from data
of Arellano Ferro et al. (2004). Since the LS power spec-
trum is noisy, therefore, a CLEAN algorithm (Roberts
et al. 1987) was used to determine the period. Fig.
8 (b) shows the CLEANed power spectrum of present
data in V and R bands and the V -band data of Arel-
lano Ferro et al. (2004). CLEANed power spectra were

Variable stars in NGC 4147

13

obtained by using the loop gain of 0.1 and iteration of
100. The CLEANed power spectra clearly show the pe-
riod of 0.335070 from present data and ∼0.49 days from
Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) data. We have also applied
the same approach as applied for V1 to determine the
period of star V2. The LS and CLEANed power spectra
of combined data are shown in Fig. 8 (c) and (d), respec-
tively. Both power spectra show the prominent peaks at
periods 0.331181093 days and 0.493055397 days. The
combined data could not phased be well with a period
of 0.493055397 days as can be seen from its light curve
displayed in Fig. 9. This indicates that both periods
may be present in the data. Star V2 is a known RRab
type variable. The period ∼0.33 days in the present
study seems to be too short for a RRab type variable
and this might be due to the short observational base-
line. The ∼0.33 days period is an alias because of the
uncertainty in the number of cycles elapsed in one day.
A close inspection of the light curves plotted for V2 in
Fig. 5 reveals an overlap between the descending branch
and ascending branch at minimum light. This is very
clear in the R band light curve and to a lesser extent
in the V band light curve. It is an indication that the
∼0.33 days period is too short. A complicating factor in
the case of V2 is that it is a Blazhko variable. This has
been well illustrated by Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) with
their extensive data coverage. The data in this present
work have been obtained on only 6 nights and it ap-
pears that observations have been obtained at diﬀerent
Blazhko phases. We assume that this is the reason for
the disconnect near maximum light in the light curves
plotted in Fig. 9. In view of this, it is not surprising
that period searches with the current data do not favour
the ∼0.49 days period. Also it is not surprising that the
combined data of Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) and the
current study might favour the ∼0.33 days period be-
cause there are more observations in the current study
compared with Arellano Ferro et al. (2004). For further
study, the period of V2 is adopted as ∼0.493 days.

The V amplitudes of V6 and V7 are derived to be
∼1.02 and ∼1.09 mag, respectively. The present light
curves for V7 show signiﬁcant scattering in both V and
R bands, indicating presence of the Blazhko eﬀect (see
Fig. 7). However, Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) did not
ﬁnd any sign of the presence of Blazhko eﬀect in V7.

A large fraction of data for the stars V3 and V11 did
not phase well with their derived periods (see Table 2).
This suggests the presence of the Blazhko eﬀect in these
stars.

Star V12 was classiﬁed as RRab type variable. We
could detect V12 only in the R band.
In the bottom
panel of Fig. 7, we show the folded light curve of V12,

where the ﬁlled squares represent present data while
ﬁlled circles show data from Arellano Ferro et al. (2004).
Few data points from Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) which
are isolated from the light curve of V12, are shown by
asterisk symbol in Fig. 7. Excluding these data points,
the amplitude of this star was found to be ∼1.32 mag in
the R band, which is smaller than that derived by Arel-
lano Ferro et al (2004). A similar conclusion was also
drawn by Stetson et al. (2005) about the light curve and
amplitude of V12.

The period and amplitude of the star V13 derived from
the present data are consistent with those of the previ-
ous studies. Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) suggested it
to be a double mode RRd star or a Blazhko type RRc.
Their light curve shows a signiﬁcant scatter at the max-
imum, whereas present light curve in the V band shows
negligible scatter. However, they also mentioned that
their observations are not suﬃcient to conﬁrm whether
it is an RRd star or a Blazhko type RRc type star. Stet-
son et al. (2005) reported that their data did not phase
with the period given by Arellano Ferro et al. (2004).
From the present observations, we conﬁrm that V13 is
an RRc type variable.

The present period for the star V14 was found to be
∼0.26 days. The previous studies reported its period
∼0.52 days (Newburn 1957), ∼0.25 days (Arellano Ferro
et al. 2004) and 0.35 days (Stetson et al. 2005). For
this star we have found slightly diﬀerent period than
that from Arellano Ferro et al. (2004) and Stetson et al.
(2005). The previous studies have also indicated that
V14 is pulsating with diﬀerent periods.

5.2. Newly identiﬁed

Stars V24, V29, V32, V33, V35, V36, V42 and V47 are
new variables which are located on HB of NGC 4147. All
of them can reasonably be assumed as RR Lyrae stars
but another consideration is their amplitudes in V and
R bands. Amplitudes of pulsating variables are found
as a function of colour. As illustrated in table 10 of
the Stetson et al. (2005), the amplitude of variability is
always largest in B and smallest in I band for RR Lyrae
stars. Considering the above fact along with periods
and shape of the light curves, of 8 new HB stars we
classify stars V29, V32, V33, V35 and V42 as RR Lyrae
stars. Their amplitudes of brightness variation in V -
band are in the range of ∼0.17 to ∼0.62 mag, whereas
their periods of variability are found to be in the range
of ∼0.28 to ∼0.30 days. The R amplitudes of these
variables except V31 vary from ∼0.12 to ∼0.55 mag.
Furthermore, their periods and amplitudes suggest that
they could be probable RRc type variables.

Figure 9. The phased light curves of V2 in V (upper panel)
and R (lower panel) bands folded with period ∼ 0.493 days.
The present data are represented by ﬁlled squares while pre-
vious data (Arellano Ferro et al. 2004) are shown by ﬁlled
circles.

In V /(V − R) CMD, star V28 is located at the begin-
ning of HB i.e very close to the red giant branch. It has
been considered as a probable member of the cluster be-
cause it is located at a radial distance of ∼0.16 arcmin
from the cluster center. Apart from its location in CMD,
the period, amplitude and shape of light curve of V28
have close resemblance with those of RRc type variables.
Hence, it can be classiﬁed as RRc type variable.

Star V31 is found to be lying almost in the center of
the cluster at a radial distance of 0.047 arcmin. With
V magnitude of 16.547 mag, star V31 is comparable to
other HB stars. Its period and V amplitude are ∼0.282
days and 0.476 mag, respectively. The shape of light
curve, period and amplitude indicate that V31 might
belong to the RRc type population.

To conﬁrm the classiﬁcation of newly identiﬁed RRc
variables, we have plotted them along with the known
RR Lyrae variables except V12 in the Bailey diagram
(amplitude versus period diagram) which is shown in
Fig. 10. The ﬁlled and open circles represent known
RRab and RRc pulsators, respectively, while ﬁlled

squares show the newly identiﬁed RRc type variables.
As shown in Fig. 10, the known RRab and RRc vari-
ables are found to be distributed in two diﬀerent regions,
similar to previous studies in other globular clusters. All
the new RRc variables as shown in Fig. 10 are located
ﬁrmly among known RRc variables, and this further
suggests that their variability type is similar to RRc
type variables. Here, we note that star V42 has slightly
lower amplitude than that of the other RRc variables.
Hence, present study identiﬁes seven variables as RR
Lyrae stars and classify them as RRc type.

5.3. Fourier Decomposition and Physical parameters of

RR Lyrae variables

The Fourier decomposition technique consists of ﬁt-
ting the observed brightness variation of pulsating stars
with Fourier series

f (φ) = A0 + Σk=4

k=1 Ak cos(2πkφ + ψk)

where φ(= (t − t0)/P ) is the pulsational phase and t0
is the time of maximum brightness. The best ﬁt Fourier
series for one RRc star as a sample is shown in Fig. 11,
and the best-ﬁt Fourier parameters are given in Table
4. The structure of the light curve can be quantiﬁed in
terms of combination of low-order Fourier coeﬃcients,
in particular the amplitude ratio, Rk1 = Ak/A1 and

In the case of RRab variables the Fourier decomposi-
tion has done using a sine series. A careful inspection
of light curves for V3 and V11 reveals that these stars
show the Blazhko eﬀect. Therefore, we have divided V3
and V11 data into two parallel light curves with diﬀer-
ent nature as shown in Fig. 12, and these variables are
designated as V3(1), V3(2) and V11(1), V11(2). The
relation between the pulsation of RR Lyrae variables
and their physical parameters can be obtained from hy-
drodynamic pulsation models with deﬁned physical pa-
rameters, which are used to generate theoretical light
curves. The physical parameters, [F e/H], Tef f , and
MV for RRab stars were calculated using the equations
given by Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996), Kovacs & Jurcsik
(1996) and Jurcsik (1998). These derived physical pa-
rameters for RRab variables are given in Tables 5. For
RRc stars, using their phase diﬀerence parameter ψ31,
the metallicity [F e/H] is calculated from the relation
[F e/H] = 52.466P 2 − 30.075P + 0.131ψ2
31 + 0.982ψ31 −
4.198ψ31P + 2.424 given by Morgan et al. (2007), where
P represents period of the variable star. The calculated
values of [F e/H] for RRc type stars are listed in Table
5.

5.4. Oosterhoﬀ classiﬁcation and distance

determination

NGC 4147 was classiﬁed by Castellani & Quarta
(1987) as Oosterhoﬀ type I in spite of having a low
metallicity (-1.83; Harris catalogue). Oosterhoﬀ (1939)
divided globular clusters into two groups; Oosterhoﬀ
type I and Oosterhoﬀ type II. The Oosterhoﬀ type
I globular clusters are found to be more metal-rich
([F e/H] > −1.7) than Oosterhoﬀ type II ([F e/H]
< −1.7) (Smith 1995). Recently, Villanova et al.
(2016) presented an extensive spectroscopic study on
the globular cluster NGC 4147 and found its metallic-
ity [F e/H] =-1.84, which is comparable to the typical
metallicity of halo globular clusters.
Stetson et al.
(2005) estimated the value of [F e/H] as -1.55. The
present mean value of [F e/H] for RRab variables esti-
mated using hydrodynamic pulsation models is -1.658.
For RRc stars, the present mean value of [F e/H] comes
out to be -1.746, which is on the scale of Zinn & West
(1984). The iron abundance estimated for RRab stars is
on the Jurcsik & Kovacs (1996) scale, while the metal-
licity of NGC 4147 adopted by Harris (1996; 2010 Edi-
tion) is on the Zinn & West (1984) scale. Therefore,
to convert the present mean value of [F e/H] for RRab
stars into Zinn & West (1984) scale we have used a
relation ([F e/H]J = 1.431[F e/H]ZW + 0.88) given by
Jurcsik (1995). On the scale of Zinn & West (1984),

the mean metallicity of RRab stars is, thus, translated
as -1.774. The present average metallicity of RRab and
RRc variables is -1.760, which is slightly smaller than
that (-1.57) obtained from the cluster CMD by ﬁtting
theoretical models and found to be more close to the
value provided in Harris catalogue as compared with
that obtained by Stetson et al.
(2005). The present
mean [F e/H] value obtained from RRab and RRc vari-
ables seems to be consistent with that of Oosterhoﬀ
type II globular clusters.

The Oosterhoﬀ classiﬁcation of globular clusters is
also discussed based on mean periods of the RRc and
RRab variables, and ratio of the number of RRc to RRab
variables. For globular clusters van Agt & Oosterhoﬀ
(1959) determined the mean periods of the RRc and
RRab variables as 0.319 and 0.549 days, respectively.
Clement et al. (2001) found the mean RRab and RRc
periods for globular clusters as 0.559 days and 0.326
days, respectively, for Oosterhoﬀ type I, and 0.659 days

and 0.368 days, respectively, in the case of Oosterhoﬀ
type II. Based on mean periods of the RRc and RRab
variables, and ratio of the number of RRc to RRab vari-
ables Stetson et al. (2005) already gave a full discus-
sion of the Oosterhoﬀ classiﬁcation of NGC 4147. They
found that the mean periods of the RRc and RRab vari-
ables were characteristic of an Oosterhoﬀ type I cluster,
but the ratio of the number of RRc to RRab variables
was characteristic of type II. Since present work iden-
tiﬁed 7 new RRc type variables, we have revised the
value for mean period of RRc type stars only and the
ratio of the number of RRc to RRab variables. The cal-
culated mean period of RRc is found as ∼0.317 days.
The present mean period of RRc stars is in good agree-
ment with that given by van Agt & Oosterhoﬀ (1959).
The number ratio of the RRc including newly identiﬁed
RRc variables to the total number of RR Lyrae type
is calculated as N c/(N c + N ab)= 0.76, which is larger
than that (0.67) obtained by Stetson et al. (2005). This

conﬁrms blue HB morphology as concluded by Stetson
et al. (2005).

The mean value of absolute magnitude, MV , for RRab
stars is determined to be 0.792 mag. From this mean
MV , the distance modulus (V −MV ) of the cluster NGC
4147 is calculated and found to be about 16.25 mag,
which gives distance to the cluster as 17.30 kpc. The
mean apparent V magnitude of RRab variables is taken
as 17.049 mag, which has been calculated from V mag-
nitudes given in Table 2. The above derived distance
of the cluster NGC 4147 agrees with that (17.49 kpc)
obtained from the V /(V − R) CMD.

6. OTHER VARIABLES

There are several studies which show that globular
clusters also contain variables other than RR Lyrae
stars. These could be SX Phe, eclipsing binaries, semi-
regular (SR) and other types (McNamara 1995, Kaluzny
1996, Mazur et al. 2003, Arellano Ferro et al. 2011,
Kopacki et al. 2012, Kopacki 2015, Martinazzi et al.
2015). Recently, Kaluzny et al. (2016) and Rozyczka et
al. (2017) in the case of globular clusters NGC 2301 and
M22 presented numerous light curves for eclipsing bina-
ries and SX Phe variables, and classiﬁed them based on
their light curves, periods and amplitudes. The present
work contains 28 new variables, 7 of them have been
classiﬁed as RRc variables (see section 5.2). Out of re-
maining 21 variables, 17 variables namely V21, V22,

V24, V25, V27, V30, 34, V36, V37, V38, V39, V40,
V41, V43, V45, V46 and V47 are probable members of
the cluster. In order to classify these 17 probable mem-
ber variables we have studied light curves and variability
characteristics of several known eclipsing, SX Phe and
other type variables. We have classiﬁed these 17 proba-
ble member variables on the basis of their light curves,
period and amplitudes. Thus, based on the light curves
and other characteristics of variability, stars V21, V22,
V24, V25, V27, V30, V36, V37, V39, V40, V41, V46 and
V47 could be eclipsing binaries, out of which stars V24,
V27, V30 and V36 are found to be located within the
half light radius of the cluster. These stars, according to
variability types listed in the Moscow General Catalogue
of Variable Stars (GCVS), are classiﬁed as Eclipsing bi-
nary systems (E), Algol (Beta Persei)-type eclipsing sys-
tems (EA) and W Ursae Majoris-type eclipsing variables
(EW). Based on the light curves, stars V24, V36, V37,
V39 and V46 are classiﬁed as EA type, while stars V22,
V25 and V30 are classiﬁed as E type, and variables V21,
V27, V40, V41 and V47 as EW type binaries.

The shape of light curves for V34 and V43 look like
RR Lyrae variables. Their variability characteristics do
not match with their location in the V /V − R CMD.
Therefore, these two could be probable RR Lyrae stars
which might belong to the ﬁeld population, and these
are termed as suspected ﬁeld stars. In section 3.2, V34
and V43 were considered to be probable members of
the cluster on the basis of their geometric probabilities,
where we did not consider variability type. We could not
classify star V45 on the basis of its light curve, period
and amplitude.

The probable member variable, V38, is found to be
located at 0.846 arcmin away from the cluster center,
and in V /(V − R) CMD it lies in the location of blue
stragglers. The location in the V /(V − R) CMD, period
and amplitude of V38 suggest that it could be a probable
candidate of SX Phe type variables.

Stars V20, V23, V26 and V44 are identiﬁed as ﬁeld
stars based on their geometric probabilities. Among
these four stars, V20 and V44 seem to be EA type vari-
able based on their light curves.

We could not detect any SR type variable in the
present cluster, and this might be due to the short span
of the observations. In the CMD of globular clusters, SR
type variables are located near the top of the red giant
branch, brighter than the HB. According to the GCVS,
they pulsate with period from tens of days to more. A
good discussion of the SR variables in M13 was recently
presented by Osborn et al. (2017) in which they have
shown CMD positions, periods and classiﬁcations of SR
variables.

6.1. Classiﬁcation based on Fourier parameters

Automated classiﬁcation of variable stars is necessary
because of having large data sets. Recently, Graham et
al.
(2017) discussed the challenges in the automated
classiﬁcation of variable stars. A useful tool for au-
tomated classiﬁcation is Fourier decomposition of light
curves. Nowdays, the Fourier decomposition technique
is used to distinguish between eclipsing binaries and RR
Lyrae variables. An illustration of this technique is a pa-
per by Masci et al. (2014) which is on automated clas-
siﬁcation of periodic variable stars. Their paper deals
with RR Lyrae, EA and EW type variables and they
use the Fourier phase diﬀerence, φ21 and φ31, as well as
the amplitudes A2 and A4.

In view of above, to see the distribution and verify
present classiﬁcation of variables we have plotted all
the present identiﬁed variables in various combination
of their Fourier parameters in Fig. 13. The Fourier
parameters of all the present eclipsing binaries, ﬁeld
stars, and unclassiﬁed star V45 including one SX Phe
have been estimated in the similar manner as discussed
in section 5.3 and listed in Table 4. The A1/A4 dia-
gram of Fig. 13 shows that RR Lyraes and eclipsing
binaries are populated in the diﬀerent regions. In Fig.
13, the A1/A4 diagram shows more clear separation of
RR Lyraes and eclipsing binaries in comparison to the
A2/A4 and A3/A4 diagrams. The A2/A4 diagram seg-
regates diﬀerent type of variable stars more than the
A3/A4 diagram but not to that extent as the A1/A4 dia-
gram. In present study, it seems that EW type variables
are located with EA type in the A1/A4, A2/A4 and
A3/A4 diagrams, but in ﬁgure 3 of Masci et al. (2014),
within given range 0.05<A2<0.02 and 0.05<A4<0.01,
EW type variables are found to be distributed among
EA type variables. The distribution of present EA, EW
and RRc type variables seems to be consistent with that
given by Masci et al. (2014). It seems that the present
classiﬁcation of eclipsing binaries based on their light
curves is reasonable. The ψ31/ψ41 diagram shows that
new RRc member variables are located among previ-
ously known RRc type variables, while from this dia-
gram it is very diﬃcult to discuss the nature of present
eclipsing binaries.

7. SUMMARY

The V R CCD photometry and detection of 42 pe-
riodic variables in the region of NGC 4147 are pre-
sented using data taken from 3.6-m Devasthal Optical
telescope (DOT), Aryabhatta Research Institute of Ob-
servational Sciences (ARIES), India. For the majority
of the known variables, we present better light curves.
Twenty eight new variables have been detected in the

present work, and most of them belong to the HB and
red giant branch. Ten new variable stars are distributed
within the half light radius . 0.48 arcmin of the clus-
ter, of which two stars are located within the core ra-
dius . 0.09 arcmin. The membership of variable can-
didates has been established on the basis of V /(V − R)
CMD, proper motions and geometric probabilities, and
majority of them are found to be members of the clus-
ter. Seven newly identiﬁed probable members of the
cluster could be RRc type, while we have classiﬁed 8
new members as AE/E, 5 as EW type eclipsing binaries
and 1 as SX Phe type variable. The iron abundance
estimated from RRab and RRc type variables is indica-
tive of NGC 4147 being an Oosterhoﬀ type II cluster.
The distance modulus of the cluster derived from light
curves of RRab variables using Fourier decomposition
technique is ∼16.25 mag which agrees with that(16.40
mag) obtained from the cluster V /(V − R) CMD by ﬁt-
ting theoretical models.
