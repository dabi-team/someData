Abstract

Today, experiencing virtual reality (VR) is a cumbersome
experience which either requires dedicated infrastructure
like infrared cameras to track the headset and hand-motion
controllers (e.g. Oculus Rift, HTC Vive), or provides only
3-DoF (Degrees of Freedom) tracking which severely limits
the user experience (e.g. Samsung Gear VR). To truly en-
able VR everywhere, we need position tracking to be avail-
able as a ubiquitous service. This paper presents WiCap-
ture, a novel approach which leverages commodity WiFi
infrastructure, which is ubiquitous today, for tracking pur-
poses. We prototype WiCapture using off-the-shelf WiFi ra-
dios and show that it achieves an accuracy of 0.88 cm com-
pared to sophisticated infrared-based tracking systems like
the Oculus, while providing much higher range, resistance
to occlusion, ubiquity and ease of deployment.

1. Introduction

Immersive experiences like virtual reality (VR) require
accurate tracking of the headset and other accessories like
hand-motion controllers. Current commercial tracking sys-
tems like Oculus Rift [4] and HTC Vive [1] are outside-in
where the tracking is performed using infrastructure exter-
nal to the VR accessories. The external infrastructure is spe-
cialized and typically uses infrared (IR) cameras along with
sensors on the headset to perform the tracking. These sys-
tems are very accurate but have the following limitations:

•

•

•

They require installing specialized hardware and dedi-
cated infrastructure wherever user wants to experience
VR. So if a user wishes to use VR headsets anywhere
in her home, one would need IR cameras everywhere.
These systems are not occlusion resistant. For exam-
ple, if the camera is blocked by furniture or if the user
turns away from the camera, then the tracking fails.
These systems have limited range, typically around 2
m in front of the camera [8].

A competing technology to provide position tracking is
inside-out position tracking found in systems like the Mi-
crosoft Hololens [3]. These systems use cameras (both

against the dotted red ground truth trajectory.

RGB and depth sensing) and implement vision based track-
ing algorithms on the headset. These systems are both ac-
curate and infrastructure-free, however they come with cer-
tain limitations. Speciﬁcally, they signiﬁcantly increase the
complexity of the headset since they need to have several
cameras as well as complex algorithms running on the head-
set to provide tracking. Further they are not robust, track-
ing fails in environments with transparent or texture-less
objects (e.g. a white wall) [63]. Finally and most impor-
tantly, these systems cannot be used for tracking peripherals
such as hand-motion controllers; the complexity of inside-
out tracking is too high to be implemented on such periph-
erals which are meant to be lightweight and cheap.

In this paper, we present WiCapture, a novel VR posi-
tion tracking system which addresses the above limitations
of existing systems. WiCapture is a WiFi based position
tracking system. Headsets transmit standard WiFi packets
which are received by standard WiFi access points (APs).
The WiFi APs receive metadata from each WiFi packet re-
ception called Channel State Information (CSI) which en-
codes the transformation the environment has induced upon
the transmitted WiFi signals. WiCapture invents novel al-
gorithms that mine the CSI metadata to recover the position
of the headset accurately. It has the following properties:

•

•

WiCapture does not require special hardware, it uses
commodity APs that can be bought in retail stores.
WiCapture is occlusion resistant, it continues to work
even when the APs and headsets are occluded due to
furniture or other objects in between.

WiCapture has larger range and operates across rooms.
It is insensitive to room illumination or texture and it
can work in the dark. Further, headset complexity is
minimal, all the headset needs is a standard WiFi chip.
At a high level, as illustrated in Fig. 2, WiCapture ob-
tains the change in the position of the transmitter by using
the change in the phase of the CSI between packets. As
with the ToF (Time of Flight) cameras, the phase is dis-
torted due to the signal received from reﬂectors; this phe-
nomenon is called multipath propagation. However, un-
like ToF cameras where the light transmitter and camera
are time-synchronized, the phase of WiFi signal is also
distorted due to the lack of synchronization of clocks at
the WiFi transmitter and receiver. WiCapture tackles these
challenges using novel algorithms that compensate for these
distortions and provides accurate phase measurement which
in turn enables accurate position tracking.

1.1. Contributions

•

WiCapture is the ﬁrst commodity WiFi-based sub-
centimeter level accurate tracking system.
We developed a novel technique to overcome the dis-
tortion due to clock differences by exploiting the mul-
tipath. This is surprising as multipath is traditionally
viewed as a complication in localization systems [35].
WiCapture is the ﬁrst system that accurately disen-
tangles signal from different paths by using CSI from
multiple packets. The key observation is that the direc-
tion of the paths remain stationary over small intervals
of time and CSI of all the packets obtained within this
time can be used to resolve multipath accurately.
We built WiCapture using commodity Intel 5300 WiFi
chips [28] which demonstrated a precision of 0.25 mm
and a position tracking error of 0.88 cm.

1.2. Limitations

WiCapture’s current prototype however has two limita-
tions compared to existing systems. It has higher latency
since the tracking is computed in the network and then pro-
vided as an update to the headset. Second, it is less accurate
than current outside-in position tracking systems. We be-
lieve that WiCapture’s accuracy is acceptable for VR given
the signiﬁcant beneﬁts that WiCapture provides around de-
ployment, coverage and occlusion resistance.

2. Related work

Motion tracking has been of great interest with applica-
tions in 3D object reconstruction, virtual/augmented reality,
motion capture and motion control [58, 41]. Systems requir-
ing infrared LEDs or photodiodes on the tracked object have
short-range, limited ﬁeld of view, difﬁculty in tracking mul-
tiple objects, and require line of sight between tracked ob-
ject and sensor [36, 4, 63, 30, 49]. Pulsed laser light based

of the displacement of the target. WiFi waves in 5 GHz spectrum
have 6 cm wavelength. So, even millimeter-level motion creates
measurable phase shift.

systems, in addition, require time synchronization of multi-
ple laser light sources [30]. WiCapture does not share these
limitations as it has long range and typical obstructions like
walls and humans are transparent to WiFi signals.

Magnetic signal-based systems [48, 5] are occlusion-
resistant but have a small range and are affected by dis-
tortions due to ferromagnetic materials [56]. Radio fre-
quency signal based techniques using RFIDs (Radio Fre-
quency IDentiﬁcation) [55, 62] and ultrawideband [25] sig-
nals demonstrated centimeter-level accuracy but have lim-
ited range and require specialized infrastructure that is not
as ubiquitous as WiFi. Tracking systems using other modal-
ities like ultrasound [23, 52] and IR [7, 18] achieve high
accuracy but require infrastructure dedicated for tracking.

Infrastructure-free approaches using inertial measure-
ment units (IMUs) can only track the orientation of a de-
vice but not the position [22]. Visual-inertial navigation
systems [21, 45, 16] which use cameras and IMUs track
the motion of a camera using natural image features un-
like earlier systems [57] which required instrumentation of
the environment with markers. However, visual systems
have problems in environments with transparent or texture-
less objects [63] and are not applicable when the camera
is occluded; for example, a phone cannot track itself when
placed in a user’s pocket. However, when they are applica-
ble, we view WiCapture and infrastructure-free systems as
complementary solutions that together can potentially form
a robust and easy-to-deploy motion tracking system.

Disentangling multipath is a widely studied problem
in Time of Flight (ToF) cameras and wireless literature as
it enables several important applications like transient light
imaging [46, 38, 42], wireless imaging [10, 11] and lo-
calization [35, 54].
[26, 24, 34, 20, 29, 19, 13, 38, 32]
explored transmitting signals at multiple frequencies to re-
solve multipath in ToF cameras. Similarly, wireless local-
ization systems [35, 59] explored using multiple frequen-
cies to resolve multipath. Unlike all the previous systems,
we use signal received from multiple packets to improve the
accuracy of estimated multipath parameters. This hinges on
the fact that the multipath parameters like direction of the
propagation paths are stationary over small time periods.

WiFi-based localization systems can be broadly classi-

ﬁed into RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) based,
ToF based, and AoA (Angle of Arrival at the receiver)
based systems. Signal strength (RSSI) based systems have
2-4 m localization error [12, 17, 27] because of distor-
tions in RSSI due to multipath. RSSI ﬁngerprint-based ap-
proaches [64, 43] achieve 0.6 m error but require an ex-
pensive, recursive ﬁngerprinting operation. ToF based ap-
proaches achieve meter-level localization error [40, 61, 54].
AoA based approaches achieved state-of-the-art decimeter-
level localization error [35, 60, 37, 51, 31]. WiCapture on
the other hand is targeted towards estimating relative trajec-
tory rather than the absolute position. WiFi-based tracking
systems [65] can only classify the trajectory of the target
WiFi device into limited number (four) of known gestures.
[53] theoretically observed that sta-
tionarity of multipath parameters improves multipath esti-
mation accuracy.
[47] removed the effect of time offset
between laser source and camera receiver on the ToF mea-
surements by considering differential ToF between different
rays. WiCapture builds on these techniques and compen-
sates not only for time offset but also frequency offset be-
tween the source and the receiver.

Techniques-wise,

3. Preliminaries

In WiFi systems, data is chunked into units of efﬁ-
cient size for communication and each unit is called as a
packet [9]. At the start of each packet, a WiFi transmitter
sends a reference signal. A WiFi receiver correlates the re-
ceived signal with the reference signal and samples at time
zero to calculate Channel State Information (CSI). This is
similar to how image is formed in a ToF camera by cor-
relating the received signal at each pixel with a reference
signal [13]. So, each antenna is a sensor element which
performs job similar to a pixel in a ToF camera and CSI cal-
culated at WiFi receiver is similar to an image obtained at
a ToF camera. We now provide a brief primer on CSI (or
image) formation model. We included a glossary at the end
of the paper for WiFi-speciﬁc terms.

3.1. CSI calculation

Consider the reference complex sinusoid signal ej2πf t of
frequency f emitted by the qth antenna on the transmitter;
here j is the complex root of
1 and t is time. The signal
−
passes through wireless channel hq resulting in the received
signal hqej2πf t. CSI corresponding to the qth transmit an-
tenna, ˆhq, is obtained as

ˆhq =

(1)

where T is time for which sinusoid is transmitted and ν is
the phase of the receiver’s local sinusoidal signal relative to
the phase of the transmitter’s sinusoidal signal (see Fig. 4).
In indoor environments, similar to ToF camera systems,

AoD of θk, the target’s signal travels an additional distance of
d cos(θk) from the second antenna in the array compared to the
signal from the ﬁrst antenna. This results in an additional phase of

transmitted signal travels along multiple paths and the sig-
nals from all the paths superpose to form the received sig-
nal. Each path is associated with an AoD (Angle of Depar-
ture) from the transmitter and attenuation of the signal along
the path. We now describe the relation between the CSI and
these path parameters. For this description, we consider a
linear 3-antenna array (see Fig. 3) although the model can
be extended to any arbitrary antenna array geometry.

3.2. Wireless channel modeling

Consider an environment with L paths; e.g., the setup in
Fig. 5(b) has 2 paths. Let the spacing between two consec-
utive antennas at the transmitter be d (see Fig. 3). Let the
AP/receiver be in the same plane as the transmitter antenna
array. Let θk denote the angle of departure (AoD) from the
transmitter for the kth path using the convention shown in
Fig. 3. Let γk denote the signal received along kth path
from the ﬁrst transmitter antenna to the receiver.

The signal along kth path travels different distances from
different transmit antennas to the receiver. These differ-
ences result in different phases for CSI corresponding to
different antennas. As described in [60] and illustrated in
Fig. 3, the vector of signals received from the transmit an-
tennas along kth path can be written as (cid:126)a(θk)γk, where

(cid:126)a(θk) = [1 e−j2πd cos(θk)/λ e−j4πd cos(θk)/λ](cid:62).
This vector (cid:126)a(θk) is also known as the steering vector. We
have as many steering vectors as the number of paths.

(2)

The signals from different paths superpose and result in

the wireless channel hq. So, wireless channel,

transmissions which is on the order of milliseconds. So, the rela-
tive phase can be assumed to be constant for T period but changes
on the order of few hundred radians within few milliseconds.

the WiFi chip for the two packets can be written as

(6)

(cid:98)H1 = AFejν1 , (cid:98)H2 = ADFejν2 .
Eq. 6 relates the observed CSI to the transmitter’s dis-
placement. It is important to note that frequency offset of
20 kHz is typical and WiFi standard allows it to be as high
as 200 kHz [9]. This implies that the distortion in CSI due
to frequency offset is orders of magnitude greater than the
change caused by transmitter’s motion. For example, if two
consecutive WiFi packets are sent with a time-gap of 10 ms
(which is typical), then the relative phase between the trans-
mitter and receiver sinusoids can change by 630 radians and
is observed in practice [44]. To compare, if the transmitter
moved by 5 mm during the same 10 ms, then the change in
the phase of any path is less than 0.6 radians.

qth element is ˆhq. Wireless channel H would be related to
the observed CSI matrix using the relation, (cid:98)H = Hejν.

3.4. Phase distortion due to frequency offset

The transmitter and the receiver WiFi chips have differ-
ent clocks and this creates an offset between the frequencies
of the local reference sinusoids used at the transmitter and
the receiver. Moreover, the offset is not constant with time
as the clocks drift [66, 15]. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the
frequency offset results in a change in the relative phase be-
tween the sinudoids at the transmitter and the receiver (see
Equation 1) from packet to packet. Let νp be the relative
phase between the two sinusoids for pth packet. Then,

(cid:98)Hp = Hpejνp .
(5)
So, if the transmitter moved by (cid:126)δ between consecutive pack-
ets, then using Equations 3, 4 and 5, the CSI reported by

Fig. 5 shows how WiCapture would be deployed and
summarizes the solution procedure. The target transmits
normal WiFi signals. Each WiFi AP/receiver calculates CSI
(or image) and sends it to a central server. The server uses
CSI from all the access points (APs) to determine the po-
sition of the target by performing the following two steps:
1. Estimate AoD and complex attenuation of all the paths.
2. Use the attenuation from consecutive CSIs along with
AoD of the paths to estimate the displacement of the
transmitter during the time between consecutive CSIs.

4.1. Estimating AoD of all the paths

Let us rewrite the CSI for the ﬁrst packet from Eq. 6 as
(cid:98)H1 = A(Fejν1 ). We can observe that CSI is nothing but a
linear combination of steering vectors in A. If one obtains
the steering vectors, then ﬁnding the AoD of all the paths
is trivial using Eq. 2. However, the problem of obtaining
steering vectors from a single linear combination of theirs is
ill-posed. Prior work [53] has theoretically investigated that
the more number of linear combinations of steering vectors
with independent weights are provided, the higher the accu-
racy of the estimated steering vectors.

Note that the AoDs of paths are relatively stationary and
do not change rapidly from packet to packet. For example,
if the receiver is 3 m away from the transmitter, a tiny mo-
tion of 1 mm changes the AoD of any path by atmost 0.02
degrees, which does not cause any measurable changes in
the elements of the steering matrix. However, the weights in
the linear combination change signiﬁcantly as even a small
motion creates signiﬁcant change in the phase of complex
attenuation along a path.

Using this insight, CSI from P packets where AoD has
not changed much are concatenated using Eq. 7. CSI for any
of these packets is linear combination of the same steering
vectors. So,

X = [ (cid:98)H1 (cid:98)H2 . . . (cid:98)HP ] = AG,

ﬁrst step, for each AP, WiCapture obtains unit vectors along the direction of departure of all the paths. Here, there are two paths, green
and red paths, with directions (cid:126)rθ1 and (cid:126)rθ2 . The paths for ﬁrst packet are shown using solid lines and the paths for the second packet using
dashed lines. Next, the phase of complex attenuation along both the paths for both the packets is calculated. Finally, the effect of frequency
offset on the phase values, ν2

ν1, is removed to obtain equations dependent on just (cid:126)rθ1 , (cid:126)rθ2 and (cid:126)δ, which can be solved to estimate (cid:126)δ.

We will now show how the displacement of the WiFi
transmitter between two consecutive packets can be esti-
mated. Consider the CSI from the ﬁrst two packets.

However, as discussed in Sec. 3.4, the term ν2

term
phase due to frequency offset is not only unavailable but
also extremely hard to predict [15] making it hard to esti-
mate and remove the term ν2
ν1. This is precisely the
phenomenon that led to long-held notion that phase infor-
mation across packets is uncorrelated in commodity WiFi
systems [44] and is unusable for tracking.

−

Use attenuation-change between paths: Our unique in-
sight is that one can get rid of the effect of frequency offset
by using the phase of the signal from multiple paths. This
is surprising as multipath is traditionally viewed as a com-
plicating distortion that needs to be compensated in many
ToF depth sensor and WiFi localization systems [35, 33].
Notice that the effect of frequency offset is the same for all
the paths, i.e., the term, ν2
ν1, is present in the change of
phase for all the paths. So, effect of the clock differences
is removed by considering the change in the phase of signal
along a path with respect to change in the phase of signal
from another path.

5. Evaluation

We implemented WiCapture using off-the-shelf Intel
5300 WiFi cards which support three antennas. We em-
ployed Linux CSI tool [28] to obtain the CSI. The WiFi
cards operate in 5 GHz WiFi spectrum (f in Sec. 3). Also,
the CSI information is quantized, i.e., each of real and imag-
inary parts of CSI is represented using 8 bits.

−

The system used for evaluation consists of APs and a tar-
get device equipped with WiFi cards. The target/transmitter
has a 3
antenna circular array with distance between any
two antennas equal to 2.6 cm. The APs operate in monitor
mode. CSI is calculated once every 6 ms. So, the trajectory
is estimated at an update rate of 167 Hz for our evaluation
experiments. An implementation is provided in [2]. We use
U = 4 APs, set V = 10 s and L = 2 paths in Algorithm 1.

5.1. Stationary experiments

We start by examining the jitter/precision of WiCapture,
i.e., how stationary the estimated position is when the target
is stationary. This is important for VR because the scene
displayed on the VR headset is not expected to change when
the user is not moving. In our experiment, the target remains

different locations in a trajectory mechanically.

stationary and transmits 1000 packets. The access points
are placed at the corners of 5 m
6 m space. The standard
deviation of the trajectory obtained by using Algorithm 1
is used as the measure of jitter. The median jitter observed
over 21 experiments at different target positions is 0.25 mm.
We measured the jitter of Oculus DK2 system by placing
it at the same positions. The Oculus camera is placed at 0.75
m away from the headset. The median jitter observed for
Oculus DK2 is 0.10 mm. So, WiCapture’s jitter in position
estimation is comparable to that of a commercial position
tracking system which requires dedicated infrastructure.

5.2. Controlled tracking experiments

Next we evaluate the resolution of WiCapture. We
mount the target on a mechanical stage which has a least
count of 0.005 cm. The target is moved in increments of
0.1 cm and then in decrements of 0.1 cm so that it reaches
the initial position as shown in Fig. 6(a). The target trans-
mits a WiFi packet at each position. Trajectory estimated by
WiCapture is translated so that the initial position is origin.
The maximum error in estimation of position of any point
in the trajectory is 0.11 cm.

We conducted another experiment where the target is
moved mechanically to different positions on a trajectory
shown in Fig. 6(b). The maximum error in estimation of
position of any point in the trajectory is 0.27 cm. Note that
WiCapture resolves even millimeter-level target motion.

5.3. Extensive tracking experiments

Motion tracking accuracy of WiCapture is dependent on
the multipath environment, the material used in walls, the
presence of metallic objects, the density of WiFi AP de-
ployment and many other factors. In this evaluation, we test
WiCapture’s accuracy in different deployment scenarios.
Compared Approaches: To the best of our knowledge,
there exists no WiFi-based system that is geared towards
tracking the motion of a commodity WiFi chip. We faith-
fully implemented SpotFi, a state-of-the-art WiFi localiza-
tion system and compared WiCapture against it. We did

not compare with other non-vision based systems like ultra-
sound [39] because of limitations detailed in section 2 such
as extensive installation of dedicated infrastructure.

Ground truth: We use an Oculus DK2 [8] headset which
is rigidly attached to the target to obtain ground truth tra-
jectory. We placed the headset 0.9 m away from the Oculus
camera. Under these conditions, we calculated the accuracy
of Oculus position tracking to be at sub-millimeter level us-
ing mechanical stage experiments (see Sec. 5.2).

Metric (Trajectory error): To focus on the shape of the
trajectory alone, we translate the trajectory reported by each
of the systems (Oculus DK2, SpotFi and WiCapture) by the
initial position of the trajectory so that the initial position
of all the trajectories is origin. Similarly, since the refer-
ence coordinate axes of different systems are not aligned,
we rotate the trajectory reported by WiCapture (and SpotFi)
so that the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the
points of the rotated trajectory of WiCapture (and SpotFi)
and the points on the Oculus trajectory is minimized. Note
that we just shift and rotate the trajectories of WiCapture
and SpotFi but do not scale the trajectories. As in other mo-
tion tracking systems [55], absolute point-by-point position
difference between this shifted and rotated trajectories and
the ground truth trajectory is reported as the trajectory error.

Indoor ofﬁce deployment

5.3.1
Method: We deployed WiCapture in a 5 m
6 m room
with access points placed at the four corners and the target
is in the same room. This is the typical access point deploy-
ment density used in state-of-the-art WiFi localization sys-
tems [35]. We traced 97 trajectories with the target device.
Fig. 1 shows a sample trajectory. The target was moved in a
continuous manner on a table rather than point by point as
done in Sec. 5.2. Fig. 7(a) shows the experimental setup.
Analysis: From Fig. 8(a), WiCapture achieves a median
trajectory error of 0.88 cm. SpotFi’s median trajectory er-
ror, 132 cm, is more than two orders of magnitude larger
than that of WiCapture. WiCapture thus achieves sub-
centimeter-level motion tracking using commodity WiFi.

5.3.2 Occlusion deployment
Method: We evaluate WiCapture under challenging con-
ditions where the target is one room and all the APs are
occluded from the target either by furniture or by walls.
Fig. 7(b) shows the experimental setup which shows cou-
ple of APs where one AP is placed outside the room where
the target is placed and another AP is separated from the
target through a cubicle. We traced 64 different trajectories.
Analysis: Fig. 8(b) plots the CDF of the trajectory error of
WiCapture and SpotFi when either one or two access points
are outside the room where the target is placed. However,
note that all the access points are occluded whether they

particular method that is closest to this ground truth.
Analysis: From Fig. 9(a), 80th percentile AoD estimation
error by using multiple packets is 11 degrees and is 3
smaller than the error obtained by using a single packet.

×

5.4.2 Removing phase distortion from frequency offset
Method: We compare WiCapture against an alternate
method which solves a system of equations where each
equation equates the change in the phase of complex attenu-
ation of a path directly as a linear function of displacement
without considering the offset from the clock differences.
We call this alternate method as assume same clock.
Analysis: From Fig. 9(b), the trajectory estimation errors
are 6

worse when frequency offset is ignored.

×

6. Discussion and conclusion

All the major WiFi chip families (Atheros, Intel, and
Marvell) expose CSI [28, 51]. Hence, we believe WiCap-
ture can be added to any commodity WiFi infrastructure.

To enable high-speed communication, WiFi chips trans-
mit reference signals on multiple frequencies and receivers,
typically, have multiple antennas. Algorithm 1 can be ex-
tended to use these additional signals to improve AoD esti-
mation. Also, Algorithm 1 tracks the target when it moves
in a 2D plane. 3D tracking can be enabled by extending
Algorithm 1 to ﬁnd the direction of paths in a 3D space.

The paper focuses on positioning alone since that is the
hardest to provide. Orientation can be relatively easily ob-
tained via IMUs already available on many devices [6].

In conclusion, we developed and implemented a WiFi-
based motion tracking system and demonstrated its perfor-
mance in different deployment scenarios. A commodity
WiFi-based position tracking system would potentially en-
able VR on mobile devices and revolutionize number of ap-
plications that can be enabled on top of motion tracking.

AoD (Angle of Departure): The angle of a path with
respect to a line joining two antennas at the source.
AP: A WiFi access point or router.
CSI (Channel State Information): The received sig-
nal when the source transmits the reference signal.
Frequency offset: The difference in frequency of the
reference signal used at two WiFi chips.
Packet: WiFi chunks data into units of efﬁcient size
for communication and each unit is called as a packet.

are inside the target’s room or not. Under these conditions,
WiCapture achieves a median trajectory error of 1.51 cm.
Thus, even in the challenging conditions where the target is
occluded from the positioning system, WiCapture achieves
accuracy acceptable for many applications.

We further stress-tested by placing three or more APs
outside the room at which point the reconstructed trajecto-
ries accumulated large errors. So, WiCapture can provide
accurate tracking only when atleast two access points are
present which are not separated from the target by walls.

×

5.3.3 Outdoor deployment
Method: We evaluate WiCapture in a 5 m
6 m outdoor
space. The experiments are conducted in shade for accu-
rate Oculus measurements. Fig. 7(c) shows the experimen-
tal setup. We traced 89 trajectories.
Analysis: From Fig. 8(c), WiCapture achieves a median tra-
jectory error of 0.85 cm compared to SpotFi’s 57 cm trajec-
tory error. Thus, WiCapture can ubiquitously track a com-
modity WiFi device as long as there is WiFi infrastructure
irrespective of whether the target is indoors or outdoors.

5.4. Deep dive into WiCapture

WiCapture achieves accurate motion tracking due to two
novel techniques. First, WiCapture accurately resolves mul-
tipath by using multiple packets for estimation. Second,
WiCapture accurately removes the phase distortion due to
frequency offset between the transmitter and the receiver.
We now test the signiﬁcance of each of these factors individ-
ually. For the following experiments, we consider the data
from the indoor ofﬁce deployment scenario in Sec. 5.3.1.

5.4.1 Improved AoD estimation
Method: We compare WiCapture against an alternate
method which uses single packet for AoD estimation (set
P equal to 1 in Eq. 7). Error of a particular method (sin-
gle packet or multiple packets) is measured by using the
absolute difference between ground truth direct path AoD
