The angular momentum formalism provides a powerful way to classify atomic states. Yet, re-
quiring a spherical symmetry from the very ﬁrst line, this formalism cannot be used for periodic
systems, even though cubic semiconductor states are commonly classiﬁed according to atomic no-
tations. Although never noted, it is possible to deﬁne the analog of the orbital angular momentum,
by only using the potential felt by the electrons. The spin-orbit interaction for crystals then takes
the ˆL · ˆS form, with ˆL reducing to ˆL = r × ˆp for spherical symmetry. This provides the long-missed
support for using the eigenvalues of ˆL and ˆJ = ˆL + ˆS, as quantum indices to label cubic semicon-
ductor states. Importantly, these quantum indices also control the phase factor that relates valence
electron to hole operators, in the same way as particle to antiparticle, in spite of the fact that the
hole is deﬁnitely not the valence-electron antiparticle. Being associated with a broader deﬁnition,
the ( ˆL, ˆJ ) analogs of the (ˆL, ˆJ) angular momenta, must be distinguished by names: we suggest
“spatial momentum” for ˆL that acts in the real space, and “hybrid momentum” for ˆJ that also
acts on spin, the potential symmetry being speciﬁed as “cubic spatial momentum”. This would cast
ˆJ as a “spherical hybrid momentum”, a bit awkward for the concept is novel.

It is well established1–4 that the state classiﬁcation for
electrons in a spherical potential, i.e., a potential that
only depends on the modulus of the electron coordinate
r, is driven by the orbital angular momentum operator

ˆS is equal to (ˆJ2

where ˆp =
is the electron momentum operator.
This operator controls the interplay between the spin
and the spatial degree of freedom of atomic electrons,
via the spin-orbit interaction5 that for a spherical poten-
tial, takes the simple ˆL
ˆS form. This scalar product is
handled by introducing the angular momentum operator
ˆS2)/2,
ˆJ = ˆL + ˆS. Since ˆL
while ˆL2 and ˆS2 commute with the atomic Hamiltonian,
the derivation of the spin-orbit eigenstates just amounts
to deriving the ˆJ2 eigenstates, which is easy to do with
the help of the angular momentum formalism. Although
mathematically smart, the concept of angular momen-
tum is physically odd because ˆJ is the sum of two op-
erators that act in diﬀerent subspaces. Yet, the angular
momentum formalism provides a very elegant way to de-
rive the degeneracy of the various atomic states.

While ˆL commutes with the Hamiltonian for atomic
electrons in a spherical potential, this is not so for semi-
conductor electrons in a periodic potential6; so, the or-
bital angular momentum L would not be a conserved
quantity. Moreover, this quantity would be inﬁnite in the
large sample limit: indeed, semiconductor electrons have
a wave function that extends over the whole sample7,8.
The mean value of the r coordinate for such “itiner-
ant” electron goes to inﬁnity, whereas it stays ﬁnite for a
bound electron orbiting around a nucleus, whatever the
sample size.

crystal are commonly labeled along the atomic notations,
which is fully questionable from the very ﬁrst line because
these notations are related to problems having a spherical
symmetry. The valence electrons of such crystals have a
threefold spatial degeneracy9, labeled along the crystal
axes (x, y, z). Like atomic electrons, they suﬀer a spin-
orbit interaction that split this spatial degeneracy10–13 in
a way that should be similar with how the threefold ℓ = 1
atomic level splits, because the (x, y, z) cyclic permuta-
tions fundamentally corresponds to a spherical symme-
try “restricted to” a π/2 rotation. Consequently, even if
semiconductor electrons do not have an orbital angular
momentum due to the lack of spherical symmetry, they
should have a vector operator that plays a similar role.

The goal of the present work is to identify the
vector operator for periodic potentials that is conceptu-
ally similar to the orbital angular momentum operator
for a spherical potential, and to possibly classify the en-
ergy levels of semiconductor electrons without borrowing
atomic notations that rely on a concept invalid for a pe-
riodic system. To do it, we go back to the foundation of
the spin-orbit interaction, in order to follow the spirit of
the procedure that leads to the classiﬁcation of atomic
states.

The vector operator ˆL reduces to ˆL = r

The λ(r) scalar follows from enforcing ˆL to have the same
dimensionality as ˆL, that is, eigenvalues that scale as ~.
ˆp when
(r) potential has a spherical symmetry; but it is
the
fundamentally diﬀerent in the case of an itinerant elec-
tron in a periodic crystal; such electron does not orbit
around a particular nucleus; so, its position can not be
described by a distance r plus two angles (θ, ϕ). Still,
we will show that, in the case of a cubic crystal, the ma-
trix representation of the corresponding ˆL(cb) operator in
the threefold basis (x, y, z) taken along the crystal axes,
is identical to the one of the orbital angular momentum
ˆL in the threefold basis of the ℓ = 1 atomic level, pro-
vided that the (X, Y, Z) atomic axes, that are arbitrary
for spherical symmetry, are chosen along the cubic crystal
axes. As a direct consequence, the spin-orbit interaction
ˆL(cb)
ˆS must split the threefold spatial level of electrons
ˆS does
in a cubic crystal, in exactly the same way as ˆL
for the ℓ = 1 atomic level: we just have to introduce the
vector operator ˆJ (cb) = ˆL(cb) + ˆS; its eigenstates will
give the spin-orbit eigenstates for cubic semiconductors,
just as the angular momentum ˆJ resolves the spin-orbit
eigenstates of atomic electrons.

Yet, the diﬀerence that exists between ˆL deﬁned in
Eq. (4) for whatever potential symmetry, and ˆL deﬁned
in Eq. (1), calls for diﬀerent names. The vector ˆL has
been named “orbital angular momentum” because the
atomic electron is best described by two angles and a
distance with respect to the nucleus around which it or-
bits. It is clear that neither orbital nor angular can be
used to qualify ˆL because these words are too closely re-
lated to a spherical symmetry. We are left with what the
operator ˆL is: it acts in the real space. This is why we
suggest to call it “spatial momentum”. By adding the
spin to get ˆJ = ˆL + ˆS, we construct a hybrid operator
that acts in two subspaces. We suggest to call it “hybrid
momentum”. Of course, these two names encompass ˆL
and ˆJ, just as when a broader concept is introduced in
physics. Still, the precise matrix forms of these opera-
tors depend on the symmetry of the problem. This is
why it is necessary to add this symmetry to their name:
ˆL(cb) for cubic crystals should be named “cubic spatial
momentum”, while the “orbital angular momentum” ˆJ is

·

a “spherical spatial momentum” within this broader un-
derstanding. Note that since ˆS has a spherical symmetry,
the operators ˆL and ˆJ have the same symmetry.

The paper is organized as follows.
In Section I, we reconsider the spin-orbit interaction in

the case of atoms, to settle the procedure.

In Section II, we consider the ˆL operator deﬁned in
Eq. (4), and we calculate its matrix representation in
the threefold valence-electron subspace when the peri-
odic potential has a cubic symmetry. We show, by using
v, µ
with ℓz = (
the spatial basis
i
with µ = (x, y, z), that the ˆL(cb) operator has exactly
the same matrix elements as the orbital angular momen-
tum ˆL in the ℓ = 1 subspace. As a direct consequence,
the matrix elements of the “cubic hybrid momentum”
ˆJ (cb) = ˆL(cb) + ˆS in the sixfold spin-orbit eigenstate
subspace are just the same as the ones of the angular
momentum ˆJ in the six j = (3/2, 1/2) atomic states. As
a result, the operators ˆJ (cb) and ˆJ have the same eigen-
values and their eigenstates have the same forms. This
brings the long-missed support for using atomic notations
for cubic semiconductor.

|

In Section III, we show that although the valence hole
is for sure not a na¨ıve antiparticle, the relation between
the destruction operator of a particle and the creation
operator of its antiparticle1, established in relativistic
quantum theory16, stays valid for valence electron and
hole in a cubic semiconductor, on condition that we la-
bel the valence electrons along quantum indices
J
that correspond to the ˆL(cb) or ˆJ (cb) eigenvalues. This
provides a secure way for turning from valence electron
operator to hole operator when writing the semiconduc-
tor physics in terms of electrons and holes, as it should
for problems dealing with semiconductor excitations.

In Section IV, we discuss the possibility to extend the
ˆL concept deﬁned in Eq. (4), that we here use for elec-
trons in a cubic semiconductor, to crystals having a dif-
ferent symmetry. This should provide a smart way to de-
rive the spin-orbit eigenstates for semiconductor crystals,
without relying on the physically obscure group theory
formalism.

We then conclude.

II. SPIN-ORBIT INTERACTION FOR

the spatial operator ˆΛ deﬁned in Eq. (4).

The ﬁrst problem is to handle the periodicity of the

interaction of semiconductor electrons.
(b) Spatial basis for cubic crystals

×

The next problem is to perform calculations using a
spatial basis relevant to semiconductor electrons. From
the Bloch theorem, we know that electrons in a periodic
crystal are characterized by a band index n and a wave
vector k that is quantized as 2π/L for a sample volume
L3, in order to fulﬁll the Born-von Karman boundary
condition, f (r) = f (r + L), which allows extending the
crystal periodicity to a ﬁnite volume.

Valence electrons in the threefold level of a cubic crys-
tal have an additional spatial index that can be taken
as µ = (x, y, z) along the crystal axes, in contrast to the
(X, Y, Z) axes for atoms that can be chosen at will due to
spherical symmetry. The valence-electron wave function
then reads8

the degeneracy of the threefold spatial level (v, µ), for k =

on reciprocal lattice vectors:

To go further, we note that for crystals with inversion

the upper threefold valence level has an even parity, in

III. PHASE FACTOR BETWEEN
VALENCE-ELECTRON AND HOLE OPERATORS

Relativistic quantum theory16 gives the link between
the destruction operator of a particle with quantum in-
dices (j, jZ ) and the creation operator of its antiparticle1,
as

ˆaj,jZ = (

−

1)j

−

jZ ˆb†j,

jZ

−

(44)

To provide a strong physical support to these cubic
operators ˆL(cb) and ˆJ (cb), let us show that, although the
hole is deﬁnitely not a na¨ıve antiparticle of the valence
electron due to its interactions with the electrons that
remain in the valence band17, so that the hole is a many-
body object in itself, the above relation is still valid for
cubic semiconductors19, provided that we label the va-
lence electron states along the eigenvalues of the cubic
spatial momentum ˆL(cb) or the cubic hybrid momentum
ˆJ (cb) deﬁned in the preceding section.

The derivation of this result relies on

that follows from Eq. (44) taken for the spin, that is,

(46)

as imposed by cyclic permutations in a cubic crystal.

Equations (24,25) then give

IV. POSSIBLE EXTENSION

V

We wish to stress that the deﬁnition of the vector op-
erator ˆL given in Eq. (4) is completely general: it only
reads in terms of the electron momentum operator ˆp and
(r) felt by semicon-
the internal electrostatic potential
ductor electrons, without any restriction on the potential
symmetry. When this potential has the cubic symmetry,
it does not come as a surprise to ﬁnd that ˆL(cb) has ex-
actly the same matrix representation as the orbital angu-
lar momentum ˆL for the ℓ = 1 atomic level, because the
(x, y, z) orthogonal axes play the same role for a sphere
and a cube.

We can go further and ask whether the ˆL concept
can be extended to a crystal having less symmetry than
the cubic symmetry, for example when the crystal axes
(x, y, z) are not equivalent, or even not orthogonal. The
identity between the ˆL and ˆL matrices will not exist any-
more, but the ˆJ eigenstates, for ˆJ constructed in the
same way out of ˆL, may still provide a convenient way
to derive the semiconductor eigenstates in the presence
of spin-orbit interaction, without having to resort to the
group theory which is physically obscure when turning
to the double group, as required to handle the spin-orbit
interaction. The possible extension of the present work

to periodic systems with other potential symmetries de-
serves further investigation; it just constitutes the start-
ing point to move forward.

(i) To do it, we ﬁrst consider µ′ = µ. By using Eq. (18),

the above equation gives the ˆΛ(cb)

x

component as

V. CONCLUSION

·

Through a microscopic procedure, we here show that
the spin-orbit interaction in semiconductors has the same
ˆL
ˆS form as for atomic electrons, with ˆL being the ana-
log of the orbital angular momentum ˆL, as supported by
their identical matrix representations in the atomic ba-
sis and the Bloch-state basis for cubic semiconductors.
Our work thus provides the long-missed support for us-
ing atomic notations to label valence electron states in
GaAs-like semiconductors, in spite of the fact that the
electrostatic potential felt by semiconductor electrons is
not spherical but periodic. Up to now, the only clean
classiﬁcation for these electrons relied on the group the-
ory, which is deﬁnitively correct but overly heavy when
dealing with a crystal symmetry as simple as cubic.

As a strong support to this labeling, we also show that
the transformation from valence electron to hole opera-
tors in a cubic semiconductor, has the same phase fac-
tor as the one from particle to antiparticle in relativistic
quantum theory. This provides a secure way to describe
semiconductor physics in terms of electrons and holes
through eﬀective electron-hole Hamiltonian11,17 and ef-
fective coupling to the electromagnetic ﬁeld20,21.

It is our pleasure to acknowledge constructive discus-
sions with the Referee and with Benoit Eble, about the
appropriate way to name ˆL and ˆJ .
