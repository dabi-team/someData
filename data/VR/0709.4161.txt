Abstract–Currently available data on the ﬁeld of velocities Vr, Vl, Vb for open star
clusters are used to perform a kinematic analysis of various samples that diﬀer by heliocentric
distance, age, and membership in individual structures (the Orion, Carina–Sagittarius, and
Perseus arms). Based on 375 clusters located within 5 kpc of the Sun with ages up to
1 Gyr, we have determined the Galactic rotation parameters ω0 = −26.0 ± 0.3 km s−1 kpc−1,
0 = −0.45 ± 0.06 km s−1 kpc−3, the system contraction
0 = 4.18 ± 0.17 km s−1 kpc−2, ω′′

parameter K = −2.4 ± 0.1 km s−1 kpc−1, and the parameters of the kinematic center
R0 = 7.4 ± 0.3 kpc and l0 = 0 ± 1◦. The Galactocentric distance R0 in the model used has
been found to depend signiﬁcantly on the sample age. Thus, for example, it is 9.5 ± 0.7
kpc and 5.6 ± 0.3 kpc for the samples of young (≤ 50 Myr) and old (> 50 Myr) clusters,
respectively. Our study of the kinematics of young open star clusters in various spiral arms
has shown that the kinematic parameters are similar to the parameters obtained from the
entire sample for the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus arms and diﬀer signiﬁcantly from them
for the Orion arm. The contraction eﬀect is shown to be typical of star clusters with various
ages. It is most pronounced for clusters with a mean age of ≈ 100 Myr, with the contraction
velocity being Kr = −4.3 ± 1.0 km s−1.

INTRODUCTION

The Galactic rotation parameters have been repeatedly determined by many authors using
objects belonging to various Galactic structural components: from ionized and neutral hy-
drogen (Fich et al. 1989; Merriﬁeld 1992; Brand and Blitz 1993; Nikiforov 1999; Avedisova
2005), from distant OB associations of stars (Dambis et al. 2001; Mel’nik et al. 2001), and
from open star clusters (Zabolotskikh et al. 2002; Gerasimenko 2004; Popova and Loktin
2005b).

Open stars clusters (OSCs) are of great interest in studying the kinematics of the Galaxy,
since they are located in a wide solar neighborhood and have reliable distance and age
estimates.

Data only on the radial velocities Vr (Mishurov et al. 1997; Gerasimenko 2004; Popova
and Loktin 2005b) are commonly used for a kinematic analysis of OSCs, because the random
errors in the radial velocities are essentially distance-independent and, hence, distant objects
can be used. Note also that data only on the radial velocities are available for distant
hydrogen clouds (Fich et al. 1989; Avedisova 2005).

When such catalogs as Hipparcos (1997) and Tycho-2 (Hog et al. 2000) appeared, it
became possible to accurately determine the mean proper motions of OSCs (Beshenov and
Loktin 2004; Kharchenko et al. 2005b). A number of authors used simultaneously two
observed velocity components, Vr and Vl (Mishurov and Zenina 1999; Dambis et al. 2001),
or all three velocity components, Vr, Vl, and Vb (Zabolotskikh et al. 2002; Bobylev 2004),
to samples of stars within 3.4 kpc of the Sun. In this paper, we also used all three observed
velocity components.

One of the important problems is to determine the distance to the center of Galactic
rotation R0. This parameter is estimated indirectly from an analysis of the velocities of
objects by reconciling the adopted model with observational data. Only in recent years has
this parameter been estimated directly from objects of the Galactic nucleus (McNamara
2000; Eisenhauer et al. 2003). A summary of the R0 values determined in the last decade
by various methods can be found in Avedisova (2005) and an overview of the R0 estimation
methods is given in Nikiforov (2004).

The goal of this paper is to determine the Galactic rotation parameters (ω0, ω′

0) and
the parameters of the kinematic center (Galactocentric distance R0 and direction l0) from
currently available data on the ﬁeld of space velocities Vr, Vl, and Vb, distances, and ages of
OSCs and to study the kinematic peculiarities of various samples diﬀering by heliocentric
distance, age, and membership in individual arms.

DATA

At present, more than 1700 OSCs are known in the solar neighborhood. Data on their
proper motions, radial velocities, and positions are needed for our purposes. A catalog that
includes 652 OSCs (Kharchenko 2001; Kharchenko et al. 2005a, 2005b; Piskunov et al. 2006)
forms the basis for our work list. The advantage of this catalog is a homogeneity and a high
accuracy of the determination of mean cluster proper motions achieved by using the ASCC-
2.5 all sky catalog (Kharchenko 2001) compiled from Hipparcos (1997), Tycho-2 (Hog et al.
2000), and several other sources. The age estimates obtained by comparison with isochrones
are available for the clusters of this catalog. The cluster distance estimates are based on the
results by Loktin and Beshenov (2003), who reconciled the photometric estimates with the
Hipparcos distance scale.We took other data from the compilation by Dias et al. (2002) and
the WEBDA database (http://obsww.unige.ch/webda/).

For such open clusters as ASCC 16, ASCC 18, and Tr 10, we used the mean radial
velocities that we improved (Bobylev 2006) using the OSACA catalog (Bobylev et al. 2006a).
As a result, we compiled a database on the proper motions, radial velocities, and distances
of 394 OSCs. They are located within about 5 kpc of the Sun. Their ages do not exceed
1.5 Gyr. The radial velocities with estimates of their random errors are available for 270
(≈ 70% of the sample) clusters. Note for comparison, that Dias and Lepine (2005) used only
212 OSCs with measured proper motions and radial velocities served as a source for their
kinematic analysis.

To identify clusters belonging to various structures (e.g., the Orion, Perseus, and Carina-
Sagittarius arms), we use a probabilistic approach that we developed (Bobylev and Bajkova
2007). It is based on the approximation of the two-dimensional (XY ) probability density
function for the objects under consideration by a set of Gaussians that represent the proba-

2

bility density functions of individual features.

THE METHOD

In this paper, we use a rectangular Galactic coordinate system with the axes directed away
from the observer toward the Galactic center (l = 0◦, b = 0◦, the X axis), along the Galactic
rotation (l = 90◦, b = 0◦, the Y axis), and toward the North Galactic Pole (b = 90◦, the Z
axis).

The youngest disk objects that lie in the Galactic plane are commonly used to determine
the Galactic rotation parameters. As a result, the observed velocity component Vb is generally
not considered, while the component of solar motion w⊙ is assumed to be known (Dambis
et al. 2001; Gerasimenko 2004). At the same time, analysis of relatively distant objects
(Zabolotskikh et al. 2002; Bobylev 2004) showed that including the components w⊙ and Vb
in the model allows their values to be also determined reliably. Therefore, we dwell on this
more general approach. In the special case where the clusters are distributed in a ring (see
the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus sample below), we used a ﬁxed value of w⊙ = 7.2 km s−1
(Dehnen and Binney 1998).

The method for determining the kinematic parameters used here consists in minimizing

Note also that Eqs. (2)–(4) are written in such a way that the direction of rotation from the
X axis to the Y axis is positive.

In this paper, apart from the system of weights (6) described above, we also use a variant

of unit weights where wr = wl = wb = 1 for comparison.

The optimization problem (1)–(5) is solved for nine unknown parameters u⊙, v⊙, w⊙, ω0,
ω′
0, ω′′
0 , K, R0, and l0 by a coordinate-wise descent method (the sought-for parameters are
taken as the coordinates). According to this method, the increment zx for each unknown,
which we arbitrarily denote by x, is sought from a necessary condition for the existence of
an extremum of the functional F (zx):

dF (zx)
dzx

= 0.

(7)

The functional F (zx) is obtained by substituting Eqs. (2)–(4) for Vr(zx), Vl(zx), Vb(zx) into
(1) using (5) in which the variable x is replaced by x + zx.

Generally, Eq. (7) is a nonlinear equation for zx. Its numerical solution by the Newton

method is an iterative process. The value for zx at iteration i is

The solution for zx usually converges after 1–3 iterations. As a result of one descent, the
sought-for variable acquires a new value, x + zx. In our case, about 1000 descents in all nine
sought-for variables were required to obtain a solution with a suﬃciently high accuracy.

A suﬃcient condition for the existence of a global extremum is that the Hessian ma-
trix composed of elements {ai,j} = d2F/dxidxj, where xi(i = 1, ...9) denote the sought-for
parameters, be positively deﬁned everywhere. We calculated the Hessian matrix in a wide
domain of parameters: 4 ≤ u⊙, v⊙ ≤ 16, 2 ≤ w⊙ ≤ 11, −30 ≤ ω0 ≤ 0, −3 ≤ ω′
0 ≤ 6, −0.6 ≤
ω′′
0 ≤ 0.3, −4 ≤ K ≤ 5, 3 ≤ R0 ≤ 15, −20 ≤ l0 ≤ 10. Our analysis of the Hessian matrix
for both weighting variants for all of the cluster samples considered here showed it to be
positively deﬁned. This suggests the existence of a global minimum in this domain and, as a
result, the uniqueness of the solution. For unit weights, the Hessian matrix is also positively
deﬁned far outside this domain, which could not be established in the case of weighting
according to rule (6). However, as will be shown below, the adopted weighting allowed the
accuracy of the solutions obtained to be increased noticeably.

Interestingly, using weights of the form wr,l,b = 1/σ2

Vr,l,b provided no positive deﬁniteness
of the Hessian matrix in the domain considered. It thus follows that several local extrema
exist in this case. Therefore, to ﬁnd the correct solution, we must know the initial approx-

start from any point of the domain. This, in particular, explains the modiﬁcation of the
weights according to rule (6), which provided a global minimum in a fairly wide domain of
parameters.

We estimated the errors in the sought-for parameters by means of Monte-Carlo simula-
tions. The errors were estimated by performing 100 cycles of computations. At this number
of cycles, the mean values of the solutions virtually coincide with the solutions obtained only
from the input data, i.e., without any addition of the measurement errors.

CONSTRAINTS

In solving the optimization problem (1)–(5), we used the following constraints on the data:
(i) the magnitude of the peculiar velocity |Vpec| < 90 km s−1; (ii) the cluster height above
the Galactic plane |z| < 500 pc. The velocity Vpec is calculated with respect to the local
standard of rest u⊙ = 10.0 km s−1, v⊙ = 5.3 km s−1, w⊙ = 7.2 km s−1 (Dehnen and Binney
1998). According to constraint (i), four clusters were rejected. Constraint (ii) is important
only for clusters older than 50 Myr. According to this criterion, the seven oldest clusters
were rejected; all of the remaining clusters proved to be younger than 1 Gyr. After applying
an additional constraint on the sample radius, r < 5 kpc, 375 clusters remained out the
originally compiled list of 392 clusters, which served as the material for a further analysis.

RESULTS

Figure 1 presents the spatial distribution of OSCs in the Galactic XY plane. Since a kine-
matic analysis of OSC samples with age separation is also the goal of this paper, we separately
displayed the distributions of OSCs younger and older than 50 Myr in Figs. 1a and 1b, re-
spectively. We see from Fig. 1a that young clusters clearly reproduce three segments of the
spiral arms (Mel’nik et al. 2001; Dias and L´epine 2005; Popova and Loktin 2005a). The
concentration regions are marked in the ﬁgure by the ellipses: the Perseus arm is on the left,
the Orion arm is at the center, and the Carina-Sagittarius arm is on the right. We clearly see
that the distribution of older clusters (Fig. 1b) is considerably more uniform, more compact,
and concentrated closer to the Sun.

Figure 2 shows the mean errors σVr , σVl, and σVb as a function of the heliocentric distance.
Note that in solving the optimization problem (1)–(5), we take into account the peculiarities
of the error distribution using the weighting procedure (6).

Table 1 presents the results of our kinematic analysis of OSC samples with diﬀerent
sample radii (r < 5 kpc and r < 2.5 kpc) and age separation (younger and older than 50
Myr) using the two weighting methods. Column 1 gives the sample type and size; column
2 lists the centroid velocity components relative to the Sun; columns 3, 4, and 5 list the
rotation parameters; columns 6, 7, and 8 give the values of the K-eﬀect, R0, and l0. The
results obtained with unit weights and weights (6) are presented in the upper and lower parts
of the table, respectively. As can be seen from Table 1, the random errors in virtually all
parameters decrease when the system of weights (6) is used. For both weighting methods,
the diﬀerence in R0, which is signiﬁcant for the sample of old clusters, is largest. As can
be seen from Table 1, we obtain a discrepancy in ω′′
0 depending on the constraint on the
sample radius. Figure 3 shows how the parameter ω′′
0 aﬀects the Galactic rotation curve. To
properly compare the results and to construct the curves indicated in Fig. 3, we obtained
two solutions at ﬁxed R0 = 7.4 kpc:

ω0 = −26.7 ± 0.3 km s−1 kpc−1,
ω′
0 = 4.27 ± 0.11 km s−1 kpc−2,
ω′′
0 = −1.05 ± 0.06 km s−1 kpc−3,

(8)

for the r < 2.5 kpc sample and

ω0 = −26.0 ± 0.2 km s−1 kpc−1,
ω′
0 = 4.14 ± 0.10 km s−1 kpc−2,
ω′′
0 = −0.44 ± 0.04 km s−1 kpc−3

for the r < 5 kpc sample. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the diﬀerence in the rotation curve
due to the inﬂuence of the second derivative becomes noticeable as one receded from R0 to
distances exceeding ≈ 1.5 kpc.

The Oort constants A = 0.5R0ω′

0 calculated from the data in the
ﬁfth row of Table 1 are A = 15.4 ± 0.6 km s−1 kpc−1 and B = −10.6 ± 0.7 km s−1 kpc−1
and have no signiﬁcant diﬀerences for all solutions of Table 1.

0 and B = ω0 + 0.5R0ω′

In Fig. 4, linear contraction velocity Kr is plotted against heliocentric distance r and
mean sample age t. To obtain these characteristics, we divided the entire data set into four

6

groups in such a way that each group contained approximately the same number of clusters.
The dependences in Fig. 4 were derived at ﬁxed Galactocentric distance R0 = 7.4 kpc. It
follows from Fig. 4a that the contraction eﬀect is traceable at all heliocentric distances r > 1
kpc and is, on average, Kr = −3.2 ± 1.0 km s−1. As we see from Fig. 4b, the contraction
eﬀect is typical of star clusters with various ages, but it is most pronounced for clusters with
a mean age t ≈ 100 Myr; the contraction velocity in this case is Kr = −4.3 ± 1.0 km s−1.

To study the kinematic peculiarities of various structures, we analyzed clusters younger
than 50 Myr belonging to various arms (Fig. 1a). To identify the arms, we calculated the
probability that each cluster belonged to one or another arm and then attributed it to the
arm the probability of belonging to which was at a maximum. In this case, the probability
densities of cluster belonging to each arm were ﬁtted by Gaussians whose bases in the shape
of ellipses are shown in Fig. 1b. The results of our kinematic analysis in which all parameters
were found simultaneously are presented in the ﬁrst four rows of Table 2. The ﬁrst and second
two rows give, respectively, the results obtained with unit weights and with weights (6).

For the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus sample, which contains mostly distant clusters,
we also obtained a solution at ﬁxed w⊙ = 7.2 km s−1 using weighting (6). This solution is
given in the last row of Table 2. It shows that a change in parameter w⊙ by ∼ 2 km s−1
does not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the determination of other model parameters.

DISCUSSION

Parameters of the Kinematic Center

As can be seen from Table 1, the values of R0 obtained with various weighting methods
agree well, within the 1σ error limits. R0 = 7.4 ± 0.3 kpc that we found using clusters with
a mixed (in age) composition is in good agreement with the R0 estimates made by various
authors.

Thus, for example, in the opinion of Avedisova (2005), the most probable value of R0
lies within the range from 7.5 to 8.2 kpc. By analyzing the R0 determinations by various
authors, Nikiforov (2004) showed that the currently best value of R0 is 7.9 ± 0.2 kpc. Using
270 OSCs, Chen and Zhu (2007) obtained an estimate of R0 = 7.95 ± 0.62 kpc.

Note that the Galactocentric distance R0 = 7.4±0.3 kpc we found provides more evidence
for the short distance scale (Dambis et al. 2001) than the IAU recommendations (1985),
R0 = 8.5 kpc.

At the same time, as we see from Table. 1, R0 depends signiﬁcantly on the sample age.
Thus, for example, it is R0 = 9.5 ± 0.7 kpc for clusters younger than 50 Myr. On the other
hand, a value of R0 = 7.1 ± 0.6 kpc, which is close to that found from all 375 OSCs, was
found from clusters younger than 50 Myr that belong only to the Carina-Sagittarius and
Perseus arms, but not to the Orion arm (Table 2). Our separate study of the Orion arm
showed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence almost in all kinematic parameters (see Table 2).

Clusters older than 50 Myr are distributed fairly uniformly in space (Fig. 1b); the
inﬂuence of the Galactic spiral structure and the Local system of stars in their motions is
minor. One would think that they should be well suited to a reliable determination of R0,
but we found R0 = 5.6 ± 0.3 kpc for them (the lower part of Table 1). Based on a kinematic
analysis of the OSC radial velocities from various catalogs and, in particular, the catalog by

7

Piskunov et al. (2006), Nikiforov and Kazakevich (2006) point out a great uncertainty in
R0. In particular, they found R0 = 6 ± 0.7 kpc from a sample of old (log t > 8.8) clusters,
in good agreement with our result.

Analysis of the motions of the stars nearest the Sun showed that the vertex deviation
for the youngest stars reaches 30◦ (Dehnen and Binney 1998). Based on the clusters the
results of whose analysis are presented in Table 1, we found no signiﬁcant deviation from the
direction l0 = 0◦. This means that the rotation of the Galactic disk is nearly axisymmetric
on large scales.

The Galactic Rotation Curve

The parameters of the Galactic rotation curve that we found in solution (8) at ﬁxed R0 = 7.4
kpc (which, in our case, is best suited to a proper comparison) are in good agreement with
ω0 = −27.5 ± 1.4 km s−1 kpc−1, ω′
0 = −1.09 ± 0.19 km s−1
kpc−3 determined from open clusters by Zabolotskikh et al. (2002) for the short distance
scale and for R0 = 7.5 kpc. There is also good agreement with the results of our analysis of
distant OB stars (Bobylev 2004): ω0 = −28.0 ± 0.6 km s−1 kpc−1, ω′
0 = 4.17 ± 0.14 km s−1
0 = −0.81 ± 0.12 km s−1 kpc−3 (for R0 = 7.1 kpc).
kpc−2, ω′′

0 = 4.54 ± 0.24 km s−1 kpc−2, ω′′

We found the parameter ω′′

0 to decrease in absolute value with increasing sample radius.
Far from the Sun, the Galactic rotation curve constructed from our data (Fig. 3) disagrees
with the rotation curve constructed, for example, from the molecular gas (Avedisova 2005),
which is ﬂat in a wide R range, from 2 kpc to 15 kpc. Therefore, using a larger number of
terms in the expansion of ω0 in terms of r/R0 is of considerable interest in establishing the
shape of the Galactic rotation curve from OSCs far from the Sun.

The Contraction Velocity

It is interesting to compare the contraction parameter K = −2.4 ± 0.1 km s−1 kpc−1 that we
found from all clusters with the results by Torra et al. (2000). Based on the Ogorodnikov-
Milne linear model, these authors found K = −2.0 ± 0.4 km s−1 kpc−1 for OB stars of all
ages in the range of distances 100–2000 pc and K = −5.1 ± 1.5 km s−1 kpc−1 for OB stars
with ages t > 60 Myr in the range of distances 100–2000 pc. Fern´andez et al. (2001) and
Bobylev et al. (2006b) showed that including the spiral structure did not eliminate the K-
eﬀect. Based on our results (Fig. 4), we can assume that the observed contraction velocity
reﬂects the ﬁlling rate of the interarm space (Marochnik and Suchkov 1984), but a detailed
study of this eﬀect is outside the scope of our paper.

Kinematic Peculiarities of the Arms

In this paper, we applied no corrections for the inﬂuence of the spiral structure to the
observed velocities. However, the inﬂuence of the spiral structure was studied in our previous
paper (Bobylev et al. 2006b), where we showed that it has a major eﬀect on the centroid
velocity components relative to the Sun. This can explain the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
components ∆u⊙ ≈ 2 km s−1 and ∆v⊙ ≈ 5 km s−1 found from various arms.

Analysis of the kinematic parameters for young clusters belonging to the Orion arm
indicates that such parameters as ω0 = −31.7 ± 0.6 km s−1 kpc−1 and l0 = −3 ± 1◦ diﬀer

8

signiﬁcantly from the Galactic rotation parameters found from all clusters. This shows that
the Orion arm has an additional rotation with an angular velocity of ≈ 5 km s−1 kpc−1
around a center that may not be associated with the Galactic center.

CONCLUSIONS

We compiled a database on 375 OSCs from various present-day catalogs and published
sources. The clusters considered are located with < 5 kpc of the Sun. Their ages do not

The following Galactic rotation parameters were determined from data on the ﬁeld of
0 = 4.18 ± 0.17 km s−1
velocities Vr, Vl, Vb for these OSCs: ω0 = −26.0 ± 0.3 km s−1 kpc−1, ω′
0 = −0.45 ± 0.06 km s−1 kpc−3, the system contraction parameter K = −2.4 ± 0.1
kpc−2, ω′′
km s−1 kpc−1, and the parameters of the center of rotation R0 = 7.4 ± 0.3 kpc and l0 = 0◦.
In addition, we performed a kinematic analysis of various OSC samples diﬀering by
heliocentric distance, age, and membership in individual arms. The value of R0 was found
to depend on the sample age. Thus, for example, it is 9.5 ± 0.7 kpc for clusters younger
than 50 Myr and 5.6 ± 0.3 kpc for clusters older than 50 Myr. Our study of the kinematics
of young OSCs in various arms showed that the derived kinematic parameters are similar to
the parameters obtained from the entire OSC sample for the Carina-Sagittarius arms and
diﬀer signiﬁcantly from them for the Orion arm. The contraction eﬀect was shown to be
typical of star clusters with various ages and to be most pronounced for clusters with a mean
age of ≈ 100 Myr; the linear contraction velocity in this case is Kr = −4.3 ± 1.0 km s−1.
