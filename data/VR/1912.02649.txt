Fully 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of astrophysical phenomena represent a challenge in standard
data visualization for scientiﬁc purposes, for the amount of processed data and the wealth of scientiﬁc information they
contain. Recently, the potential of virtual reality (VR) hardware and software began to be exploited for the purposes
of scientiﬁc data analysis. Moreover, VR has also been adopted in diﬀerent ﬁelds of public outreach and education
with excellent outcome. To this end, YouTube and online multimedia digital stores host several VR titles with high
visual impact in the categories of Astrophysics and Space Science. However, the routinely scientiﬁc use of the VR
environment is still in its infancy and requires the development of ad-hoc techniques and methods.

In the ﬁrst half of 2019, we launched 3DMAP-VR (3-Dimensional Modeling of Astrophysical Phenomena in Virtual
Reality), a project aimed at visualizing 3D MHD models of astrophysical simulations, using VR sets of equipment.
The models account for all the relevant physical processes in astrophysical phenomena: gravity, magnetic-ﬁeld-oriented
thermal conduction, energy losses due to radiation, gas viscosity, deviations from proton-electron temperature equi-
libration, deviations from the ionization equilibrium, cosmic rays acceleration, etc. (e.g. Orlando et al. 2011, 2015,
2016, 2017).

The workﬂow to create VR visualizations of the models combines: 1) accurate 3D HD/MHD simulations performed
for scientiﬁc purposes, using parallel numerical codes for astrophysical plasmas (e.g. the FLASH code, Fryxell et al.
2000, or the PLUTO code, Mignone et al. 2007) on high performance computing facilities (e.g. CINECA, Bologna,
Italy); 2) data analysis and visualization applications (e.g. Interactive Data Language, YT project, ParaView, Visit,
MeshLab, MeshMixer) to realize navigable 3D graphics of the astrophysical simulations and quickly have a VR repre-
sentation of the models. The 3D representations are realized using a mixed technique consisting of multilayer isodensity
surfaces with diﬀerent opacities. Once the 3D graphics are ready, they are uploaded on Sketchfab, one of the largest
open access platforms to publish and share 3D virtual reality and augmented reality content. Our VR laboratory
includes two Oculus Rift VR sets of equipment and dedicated computers with advanced graphics cards to visualize
the models in VR. The laboratory is used to analyze the numerical results in an immersive fashion, integrating the
traditional screen displays, and allows scientists to navigate and interact with their own MHD models. At the same
time, we use the VR in educational and public outreach events in order to visualize invisible radiation, improve the
learners sense of presence and, eventually, increase the content understanding and motivation to learn.

We realized an excellent synergy between our 3DMAP-VR project and Sketchfab to promote a wide dissemination
of results for both scientiﬁc and public outreach purposes. We realized a Sketchfab gallery, ”Universe in hands”,
which gathers diﬀerent models of astrophysical objects and phenomena developed by our team for scientiﬁc purposes
and published in international scientiﬁc journals. More speciﬁcally these models describe (see Fig. 1): magnetic
structures of the solar and stellar coronae (e.g. Reale et al. 2016); the interaction between a star and its planet
(cf. Pillitteri et al. 2015); accretion phenomena in young stellar objects (e.g. Orlando et al. 2011); protostellar jets
(e.g Ustamujic et al. 2016); nova outbursts (e.g. Drake & Orlando 2010); the outcome of supernova explosions (e.g.
Orlando et al. 2016); the interaction of supernova remnants with the inhomogeneous surrounding environment (e.g.
Orlando et al. 2015); the eﬀects of cosmic ray particle acceleration on the morphology of supernova remnants (e.g.

Orlando et al. 2012). In addition we created a second gallery, ”The art of astrophysical phenomena”, which collects
artist’s view of astrophysical phenomena for public outreach purposes. The two galleries are publically available and
continuously updated to include new models.
