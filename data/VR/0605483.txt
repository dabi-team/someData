High resolution optical spectroscopy of an LBV-candidate
inside the Cyg OB2 association

3rd November 2018

Abstract For the ﬁrst time, we obtained the high-resolution (R = 15000 and 60000) optical spec-
tra for the extremely luminous star No. 12, associated with the IR–source IRAS 20308+4104,
a member of the Cyg OB2 association. We have identiﬁed about 200 spectral features in range
4552–7939 ˚A˚A, including the interstellar NaI, KI lines and numerous DIBs, which are the
strongest absorption lines in the spectrum, along with the HeI, CII, and SiII lines. A two-
dimensional spectral classiﬁcation indicates that the star’s spectral type is B5 ± 0.5Ia+. Our
analysis of the Vr data shows the presence of a Vr gradient in the stellar atmosphere, caused by
the infall of matter onto the star. The strong Hα emission displays broad Thompson wings and
time-variable core absorption, providing evidence that the stellar wind is inhomogeneous, and
a slightly blue-shifted P Cyg type absorption proﬁle. We concluded that the wind is variable in
time.

1. Introduction

Study of mass loss and chemical composition variations in the surface layers are important for our
understanding of the evolution of massive stars. It is crucial to establish the evolutionary stage and
the star’s luminosity. One widely used approach to stellar evolution study is to investigate stars
inside clusters and groups: the evolutionary stage, age, and luminosity can be determined more
reliably for group members, whereas these characteristics are rather uncertain for ﬁeld stars. It
is especially important to study group members that are rare, such as LBV–stars or Wolf–Rayet
stars. From this point of view, the Cyg OB2 (or VI Cyg) association, with an age of several million
years, is of special interest. The Cyg OB2 association contains a group of high luminosity stars with
very high masses (about 100 M⊙), and that is so large that the association may be considered as
a young globular cluster [1]. According to Massey et al. [2], unevolved O– and Of –stars have been
identiﬁed in the association, as well as an LBV candidate–the variable star No. 12 from the list
by Schulte [3]. Hereafter we will refer to this star as Cyg OB–No. 12. The star Cyg OB2–No. 12 is
among the brightest OB stars in the IR, due to the presence of circumstellar matter lost by the star
via its strong wind [4]. The star is identiﬁed with the IR source IRC+40430 = IRAS 20308+4104.
For a association distance of m − M = 11.m2, the star luminosity is log(L/L⊙) = 6.26 [5] and
its bolometric absolute magnitude is Mbol = −11m [6]. Massey and Thompson [6] classiﬁed the
star as B5 Ie, and Souza and Lutz [7] as B8 Ia, whereas the authors [8] considered it as one of
brightest A–supergiants in Galaxy. Later, Massey et al. [2] conﬁrmed the LBV candidate status
of Cyg OB2–No. 12 based on its membership in an association whose turnoﬀ point is near that

for the Milky Way’s most massive stars. The luminosity of Cyg OB2–No. 12 from its association
membership indicates that the star is one of the four most luminous stars in our Galaxy (see, for
instance, the diagram for S Dor stars in 9 and in the review of de Jager [5]). However, the star’s
visible ﬂux is strongly attenuated due to the large distance to the association and the presence of
strong extinction: the observed magnitudes are B = 14.m41, V = 11.m40. It was recognized long ago
that, apart from being distinguished by its high luminosity, Cyg OB2–No. 12 also displayed very
high reddening [10, 11]. Based on their photometric study of a stellar sample in Cyg OB2, Torres-
Dodgen et al. [12] estimated the distance m − M = 11.m2 ± 0.m2 and its distance d = 1.7 ± 0.m3 kpc,
and conﬁrmed that the high interstellar reddening for the association members (with a mean value
E(B − V ) = 1.m82) was satisﬁed by a normal law. The exception is Cyg OB2–No. 12, whose visual
extinction exceeds 10m (!). Obviously, spectroscopic studies of stars experiencing such a high degree
of reddening are possible only thanks to the relatively small distance to the association and the
high absolute luminosities of many of its members.

Lozinskaya et al. [13] also emphasized that the group of massive stars inside the Cyg OB2 asso-
ciation probably possessed the Galaxy’s strongest stellar winds, which are capable of signiﬁcantly
aﬀecting the ambient interstellar gas over some two to three million years. Cyg OB2–No. 12 is one
of the few late B stars known to radiate thermal radio emission [4]. The variability of its radio ﬂux
is surprising [14]. White and Becker [15] estimated the mass loss rate to be 4 × 10−5M⊙/yr, that is
too high for a normal supergiant, but consistent with the extreme luminosity of Cyg OB2–No. 12.
According to the criterion suggested by Humphreys and Davidson [8], a mass loss rate that high
indicates that Cyg OB2–No. 12 is an LBV star. Through his modeling of the IR spectral energy
distribution, Leitherer et al. [16] estimated the star’s eﬀective temperature to be Tef f =13600 K and
the envelope’s electron temperature to be Te=5000 K. The combination of a hot atmosphere and a
cool, dense envelope found for Cyg OB2–No. 12 is not unique: such structures are known for S Dor
stars [17]. The light from Cyg OB2–No. 12 is polarized [18]. The broadband polarimetry of Schulz
and Lenzen [17] at 0.3–1.1 µ displayed linear polarization exceeding 10%, providing evidence for a
nonspherical distribution of the circumstellar material, and hence for a nonspherically symmetri-
cal stellar wind. The accumulated observations show that Cyg OB2–No. 12 is a crucial object for
studies of late evolutionary stages for massive stars, creating the need for high-resolution optical
spectroscopy that would make it possible to classify the spectrum, and thereby reﬁne estimates of
the star’s fundamental parameters and the characteristics of its stellar wind.

2. Observations and data reducing

Our spectroscopic observations of Cyg OB2–No. 12 were acquired with the 6 m telescope of the
Special Astrophysical Observatory (Russian Academy of Sciences) using echelle spectrographs.
Our ﬁrst set of observations, obtained on June 12, 2001 using the PFES spectrometer [19] with
a 1040x1170-pixel CCD at the primary focus, yielded a spectrum in the interval 4542–7939 ˚A˚A
with a resolution of R = λ/∆λ ≈ 15000 (20 km/s). A second observing run was made on April
12, 2003 at the Nasmyth focus using the NES spectrograph [20] equipped with an image slicer
[21]. We obtained a spectrum in the range 5273–6764 ˚A˚A with a resolution of R ≈ 60000 (5 km/s)
using a 2048x2048 CCD. We used the PFES spectrometer to acquire spectra of bright, luminous
B stars for use in spectral classiﬁcation (see Section 3.1 for details). We removed cosmic-ray traces
via a median averaging of two consecutive exposures. The wavelength calibration was performed
using the spectrum of a ThAr hollow-cathode lamp. We recorded the spectrum of the hot, rapidly
rotating star HR 4687, which has broad lines, each night to subtract the telluric spectrum. The
preliminary reduction of the CCD images of our echelle spectra (removal of cosmic rays, background
subtraction, wavelength calibration, and extraction of the spectral orders) was performed using

the MIDAS (98NOV version) ECHELLE package. The ﬁnal reduction (continuum normalization,

Klochkova & Chentsov: Spectroscopy of Cyg OB2-No. 12

measurements of radial velocities and equivalent widths for various spectral features) was done
using the DECH20 program package [22].

3. Results

3.1. Main peculiarities of the Cyg OB2–No. 12 spectrum

The main features of Cyg OB2–No. 12 are evident even in low-resolution spectra [10]: it is an early-
type, very luminous star with very strong Hα emission and very strong diﬀuse interstellar bands
(DIBs). The Na D1,2 doublet lines display no obvious peculiarities. Wendker and Altenhoﬀ [4] note
that the Hα proﬁle is probably variable. Our high-resolution spectra permits us for the ﬁrst time
to make detailed line identiﬁcations, classify the spectrum, and measure radial velocities. Table 1
presents identiﬁcations of the spectral features in the spectra obtained on June 12, 2001 and April
12, 2003, along with their equivalent widths W , residual intensities r, and heliocentric radial ve-
locities Vr. Figs. 1 and 2 display fragments of the spectra of Cyg OB2–No. 12 and of the hypergiant
HD 168625 (B6 Ia+, Mv = −8.m5). The spectrum of HD 168625 was taken on June 19, 2001 with
the PFES spectrometer. These spectra are very similar, demonstrating that the stars have similar
temperatures and luminosities. In addition, DIBs are equally well represented in these spectra and
have similar intensities. The strongest of them, the 5780 and 5797 ˚A bands, dominate in Fig. 1,
but even the weak DIBs at 5766, 5773 ˚A, etc. have comparable intensities to the stellar NII, AlIII,
and SiIII absorption. The DIBs at 6376 and 6379 ˚A in Fig. 2 are almost as deep as the SiII (2) ab-
sorption. The majority of spectral features are shallow absorption lines with depths of 0.02-0.03 of
the continuum level, whose depths, equivalent widths, and radial velocities are uncertain (marked
with colons in Table 1). The signal-to-noise ratio in the blue was not high, and we used nonstan-
dard criteria for our quantitative spectral classiﬁcations. The sets of classiﬁcation criteria and the
wavelength intervals used for 2001 and 2003 overlap only partially. The classiﬁcation techniques are
described in more detail in [23]. Here we note only that the HeI, CII, NII, AlIII, SiII, SII, and FeII
lines were used. The W (Sp) calibration relations were based on the supergiant standard stars ǫ Ori
(O9.5Ia), HD 13854 (B1.2Iab), HD 14134 (B2.2Ia), HD 206165=9 Cep (B2.5Ib), HD 198478=55 Cyg
(B3.4Ia), HD 164353=67 Oph (B3.6Ib, Mv = −5.m6), HD 58350=η CMa (B3.9Ia), HD 13267=5 Per
(B5Ia), HD 15497 (B6Ia, Mv = −7.m0), HD 183143 (B7.7Ib, Mv = −8m), HD 34085=β Ori (B8.2Ia,
Mv = −7.m3), and HD 21291 (B9.3Ib, Mv = −6.m9). A comparison of the depths and equivalent
widths in our two spectra shows that, although the depths were slightly smaller in 2001 than in 2003
(due to the lower resolution), the equivalent widths did not diﬀer systematically. It is thus natural
that the spectral types derived for Cyg OB2–No. 12 for the 2001 and 2003 data were the same within
the errors: B5.0±0.5 and B4.8±0.5, respectively. The luminosity class for both Cyg OB2–No. 12 and
HD 168625 is Ia+. Evidence for the star’s high luminosity is also provided by the high intensity
of the OI 7773 ˚A IR–triplet, whose equivalent width is Wλ=1.14 ˚A, corresponding to an absolute
magnitude of Mv < −8m.

3.2. The Hα line proﬁle

Based on two spectra with 3 ˚A resolution taken three days apart, Souza and Lutz [7] concluded
that the radial velocity derived from the Hα emission line was variable. An absorption line at
6532 ˚A was detected in one of the spectra, whose posi- tion corresponds to an expansion velocity
of about −(1400 ÷ 1500) km/s. The spectrum with 7 ˚A resolution presented in [18] shows a similar
absorption feature (6526 ˚A). Our high-resolution spectra enabled us to study the ﬁne structure of
the Hα emission (Fig. 3). The proﬁle has broad wings extending to at least ±1000 km/s is slightly
asymmetric, with a weak absorption visible in its left wing, suggestive of a P Cygni type proﬁle; and
displays absorption features with variable shape in the core. These absorption features correspond

to transitions in the Hα line rather than to the telluric spectrum, whose contribution was carefully

4

Klochkova & Chentsov: Spectroscopy of Cyg OB2-No. 12

removed from the spectrum. We are inclined to interpret the emission wings of the Hα proﬁle
as being due to Thompson scattering on the envelope’s free electrons [24, 25, 26]. Stark emission
wings are formed in denser media, such as the deexcitation region behind the shock front in the
atmosphere of W Vir [27]. Following Wolf et al. [28], let us estimate the eﬃciency of Thompson
scattering for a hot envelope in which the hydrogen is completely ionized. In accordance with [15],
let us assume a mass-loss rate of 4 × 10−5M⊙/yr and a radius for the envelope equal to twice the
stellar radius (R⋆ = 338R⊙ [14]). It is more diﬃcult to estimate the escape velocity based on the two
absorption features observed in the Hα wing [7, 18]. The value of 1400 km/s used in [15] seems too
high. Note that the shell forming the narrow absorption feature must be spatially separated from
the shell forming the P Cygni proﬁle. It is not clear why the presence of this shell is not manifest
in the spectrum taken three days later [7]. The distance covered at such a speed over three days
is about 3.7 × 1013 cm, which is a factor of four higher than the envelope’s radius estimated in an
adiabatic cooling wind model, based on observations of free–free emission transitions at 6 cm [15].
This would imply that the optical spectral features are formed further from the star than the radio
emission. This discrepancy can be removed if we reject the assumption about spherical symmetry
for the envelope. In fact, if the wind extends diﬀerently in diﬀerent directions, its temperature in
a spherical approximation will be lower than the real temperature, as is observed (5000± 1500 K
[15]). For the above high escape velocity and large radius, the optical depth to Thompson scattering
in the spherically symmetric approximation [28] is insigniﬁcant, about 0.01. If the escape velocity
is lower by an order of magnitude, as is suggested in [14] (see also below our estimate of the highest
wind velocity), and the wind is not spherically symmetric, the Thompson scattering optical depth
increases by more than an order of magnitude. We conclude that the absorption features we have
detected at the peak and in the blue wing of the Hα line are variable, even after we have taken
into account the diﬀerent spectral resolutions of our observations.

3.3. Interstellar bands

The strength of the interstellar (and circumstellar) extinction of the light from Cyg OB2–No. 12
has made the star a popular target for studies of interstellar spectral features. In particular, the
strong absorption towards Cyg OB2–No. 12 is of considerable interest from the point of view to
investigate the discrete distribution of the absorbing material (cf., for example, Scappini et al.
[29] and references therein). For the ﬁrst time Souza and Lutz [30] detected IR–bands of the C2
molecule, and molecular features in the spectrum of Cyg OB2–No. 12 were subsequently analyzed
in a number of studies. In their high-spectral resolution study, Gredel and M¨unch [31] detected
a four-components structure in the IR (1,0) band of the C2 molecule’s Phillips system, which
displayed a range of velocities from −10.6 to +13.2 km/s, whereas Chaﬀee and White [32] observed
two components in the KI line with velocities from −12.9 to −4.3 km/s. Based on echelle spectra,
Gredel et al. [33] analyzed the physical conditions for the formation of the C2 and CN molecules in
detail, and also detected an interstellar RbI line. We also note that the star’s spectrum is densely
populated by interstellar features, as can clearly be seen in Figs. 1 and 2. As follows from Figs. 1
and 2 and Table 1, the intensities of the main DIBs and of the NaI lines are higher than those of
the strongest photospheric absorption lines (HeI, CII, SiII) in the spectrum of Cyg OB2–No. 12.
We discuss the structure of the NaID lines below, in connection with the systemic velocity of
Cyg OB2–No. 12.

3.4. The radial velocities pattern

Table 2 presents radial velocities for individual lines and averages for groups combining lines with
similar residual intensities. Possible systematic errors for the velocities in Tables 1 and 2 estimated

from the telluric and interstellar lines are within 2 and 1 km/s for the June 12, 2001 and April 12,

Klochkova & Chentsov: Spectroscopy of Cyg OB2-No. 12

5

2003 spectra, respectively. It is also necessary to take into account the diﬀering spectral resolutions
when comparing Vr (NaI) for the 2001 and 2003 spectra. Fig. 4 shows that, in the April 2003
spectrum, the main component with r ≈ 0.01 and Vr = −9 km/s is clearly separated from a
component with Vr = −34 km/s that is half as strong. The June 2001 PFES spectrum does not
separate these components, but the asymmetry of the proﬁle is appreciable, with the blue wing
being less steep. The random measurement errors for individual lines can be judged from the scatter
of the circles in the upper panels of Fig. 5, with the following caveats. The velocities were measured
from absorption cores, i.e., from the lowest parts of the proﬁles, with exclusion of the very deepest
portions having much lower intensity gradients. Of the two lines whose proﬁles are displayed in the
bottom panels of Fig. 5, the core in the June 2001 spectrum is sharper for the HeI absorption line,
so that its position can be measured more accurately, whereas the SiII absorption line is sharper
in the April 2003 spectrum. The SiII (2) lines (open circles in Fig. 5) are obviously blue shifted
relative to other absorption lines with the same depths, but the other lines may also possess small
mutual shifts, increasing the scatter of the data points in the Vr(r) diagrams. In addition, many of
the lines are asymmetric (as is also clearly visible in Fig. 5), and a small shift in r has a considerable
inﬂuence on the resulting value of Vr.

3.4.1. The systemic velocity

Unfortunately, there are no data on the radial velocities of any stars of the association besides
Cyg OB2–No. 12 itself and the spectroscopic binary Cyg OB2–No. 5, whose velocity is very uncertain
[34]. However, a rough estimate of the systemic velocity, Vsys, for Cyg OB2–No. 12 is possible based
on the diﬀerential rotation of the Galaxy. In our case, this estimate is facilitated by the fact that
the dependence of the velocity on distance is weak in the direction toward Cyg OB2 (along the
Cygnus arm), and almost disappears in the region of the Cyg OB2 association [35]. Under this
circumstance we used a wider range of acceptable distances for stars, HII regions, and cool gaseous
clouds whose radial velocities are to be used to estimate Vsys. The relation between the heliocentric
radial velocity, Vr, and Galactic longitude, l, for stars between 1 and 2 kpc selected from the catalogs
[36, 37, 38] gives the mean value Vr = −12 ± 3 km/s for the longitude of Cyg OB2 (l = 80◦). The
peak of the interstellar Hα emission proﬁle at l = 80◦ is also at Vr = −12 km/s [13, 39], and the
highest intensity of the CO radio emission is at Vr = −9 km/s [40]. A similar Vr value for the
Cyg OB2 association (about −10 km/s) results from the detailed analysis of the motions of stars
and interstellar matter in the Cygnus arm carried out by Sitnik et al. [41].

Let us supplement the above Vr estimates with those obtained speciﬁcally for Cyg OB2–No. 12.
According to McCall et al. [42], the CO emission has two intensity peaks, with Vr = −7 and
−2 km/s, and the interstellar absorption proﬁles of KI, CO, C2, etc. have up to ﬁve components
with Vr values from −13 to 12 km/s. The proﬁles of the interstellar NaI doublet in our high resolution
spectrum (Fig. 4) have two main components: the strongest is saturated and has Vr = −9 km/s,
while the shallower one is blueshifted and has Vr = −34 km/s. A similar division into components
with the same intensity ratio and velocities (−11 and −35 km/s) is observed in the NaI D2 line for
the nearby hypergiant P Cygni [43]. The blue shifted component is probably circumstellar, and is
associated with the stellar wind. Judging from its velocity, the main absorption feature is formed
immediately in front of the star, in the gas complex that Sitnik et al. [41] call BB. There are dips
at the bottom of this absorption feature, whose velocities (−13 and −6 km/s) coincide with those
for the components of the KI line according to Chaﬀee and White [32] and McCall et al. [42].
Finally, we should include our velocity estimates for stationary envelope emission lines (the ﬁrst
rows of Table 2). The weak FeII 7513 ˚A emission line, which is unfortunately the only one, gives
Vr ≈ −12 km/s; the upper, symmetric part of the Hα proﬁle, which experiences minimal distortion
from the absorption components, gives Vr = −10, . . . −15 km/s.

6

Klochkova & Chentsov: Spectroscopy of Cyg OB2-No. 12

As expected, all these estimates are close to each other. We adopt Vsys = −11 ± 2 km/s as the

systemic velocity for Cyg OB2–No. 12.

3.4.2. Temporal and line-to-line variations of Vr

Fig. 5 and the data in Table 1 show that the radial velocities measured from the absorption cores
vary in time and change with the line intensity. In both our spectra, the weakest lines (r → 1)
yield Vr values lower than Vsys (by 5 and 14 km/s, respectively, in 2001 and in 2003), testifying to
variable rates of expansion of the layers where these lines are formed. Stronger lines show positive
shifts relative to weaker ones, with the exception of the SiII lines, marked in Fig. 5 as open circles.
The slope of the ﬁlled-circle chain in the left panel of Fig. 5, corresponding to June 12, 2001, is
quite evident, whereas it is poorly represented in the upper right panel of Fig. 5 due to the limited
spectral range and some deﬁciencies of the April 12, 2003 data. The core of the deepest available
absorption line, HeI 5876 ˚A, shows the highest Vr, which exceeded Vsys by 10 km/s on June 12,
2001; according to McCall et al. [44], this shift reached values as large as 22 km/s.

3.4.3. Manifestations of the wind

The stellar wind from Cyg OB2–No. 12 is manifest itself most clearly in the Hα proﬁle. Fig. 3 shows
that the proﬁle shape varies with time, but its principal features are preserved: strong emission,
with a dip at the short-wavelength slope, a sheared peak, and extended Thompson wings. The
blueshifted absorption is barely visible in the June 2001 spectrum and is more pronounced in the
April 2003 spectrum, but can be traced at least to Vr = −160 km/s in both cases; i.e., to the same
limit that is reached by the blue wings of the absorption lines presented in Fig. 5. The wind’s velocity
limit is about 150 km/s. The intensity inversions in the upper part of the Hα proﬁle are especially
interesting. They indicate that the wind from Cyg OB2–No. 12 is not uniform: in addition to the
high velocity material noted above, it contains a fair amount of material that is nearly stationary
relative to the star, or is even falling onto the stellar surface. The coexistence of lines with direct
and inverse P Cygni proﬁles in the same spectrum, and even combinations of such features in the
proﬁle of the same line, has been noted for some LBVs at their maximum brightness [45, 46]. Such
a behavior leads us to reject the spherically symmetric wind model. It is possible that the slow
part of the wind also contributes to the absorption proﬁles; spectroscopic monitoring is needed
to check this hypothesis. So far, this possibility is supported by the coincident velocities for the
central dips of the Hα line and the wellformed cores of strong absorption lines (HeI 5876 ˚A in 2001
and SiII 6347 ˚A in 2003), as well as by the fact that the shift of all the absorption lines in the
2003 spectrum towards short wavelengths relative to their positions in 2001 was accompanied by
a similar shift of the central dip in Hα. At any rate, both the hydrogen lines and the strongest
absorption lines in the visual spectrum Cyg OB2–No. 12 (for the available part of the spectrum,
these are the HeI and SiII lines) are partially formed in the wind.

4. Conclusions

Our detailed spectroscopy of the extremely luminous star Cyg OB2–No. 12 in the stellar associa-
tion Cyg OB2 at 4552–7939 ˚A˚A has enabled us to identify about 200 spectral features, including
numerous interstellar features (NaI, KI, and DIBs). Using spectral classiﬁcation criteria developed
for red wavelengths, we have determined the star’s spectral type (B5 ± 0.5) and luminosity class
(Ia+). The intensity of the IR oxygen triplet, OI 7773 ˚A, leads to an absolute magnitude for the star
Mv < −8m. Our analysis of the radial-velocity pattern indicates the presence of a radial velocity
gradient in the atmosphere due to the infall of matter onto the star. We have detected ﬁne structure
of the proﬁle of the strong Hα emission: broad emission wings (to ≈ 1000 km/s), absorption at the

peak that varies with time, and weak P Cygni absorption features corre sponding to expansion

Klochkova & Chentsov: Spectroscopy of Cyg OB2-No. 12

velocities up to 150 km/s. The intensity inversion at the Hα peak provides evidence that the stellar
wind is not uniform: in addition to that part of the wind that moves away from the star, there
is also material that is at rest relative to the star, or is even falling onto the stellar surface. The
radial velocities measured from the absorptionline cores vary with time and with the line intensity.
The weakest lines (r → 1) in our two spectra give Vr values lower than Vsys (by 5 and 14 km/s,
respectively, in 2001 and 2003), testifying to a variable rate of expansion of the layers in which they
are formed. Our discovery of evidence that the wind is variable shows the necessity of spectroscopic
monitoring of this star.

Klochkova & Chentsov: Spectroscopy of Cyg OB2-No. 12

Figure 1. Fragment of the spectrum of Cyg OB2–No. 12 taken on June 12, 2001 (top) compared to
the corresponding fragment of the spectrum of the B5Iae+ star HD 168625 (bottom). The stellar
lines are marked, with their identiﬁcations given. The rest of the absorption features are DIBs; the
deepest lines are at 5780 and 5797 ˚A (Table 1).

Figure 5. Radial velocities in the atmosphere of Cyg OB2–No. 12. Top: the heliocentric radial
velocities versus the residual intensities. Circles correspond to absorption cores, the horizontal dash
to the FeII 7513 ˚A emission, and arrows to dips in the peak of the Hα proﬁles. The vertical dashed
lines show the direction and amount of wing shifts for the SiII 6347 ˚A and HeI 5876 ˚A lines, and the
horizontal dashed line corresponds to Vsys = −11 km/s. Bottom: the corresponding proﬁles of the
SiII 6347 ˚A and HeI 5876 ˚A lines.
