Abstract 

The  characteristics  of  ionized  and  HI  gas  in  the  peculiar  star/cluster  complex  in  NGC  6946, 
obtained  with  the  6-m  telescope  (BTA)  SAO  RAS,  the  Gemini  North    telescope,    and  the 
Westerbork  Synthesis  Radio  Telescope  (WSRT),  are  presented.  The  complex  is  unusual  as 
hosting  a  super  star  cluster,  the  most  massive  known  in  an  apparently  non-interacting  giant 
galaxy. It contains a number of smaller clusters and is bordered by a sharp C-shaped rim. We 
found  that  the  complex  is  additionally  unusual  in  having  peculiar  gas  kinematics.  The  velocity 
field of the ionized gas reveals a deep oval minimum, ~300 pc in size, centered 7" east of the 
supercluster.  The  Vr  of  the  ionized  gas  in  the  dip  center  is  100  km/s  lower  than  in  its 
surroundings, and emission lines within the dip appear to be shock excited. This dip is near the 
center of an HI hole and a semi-ring of HII regions. The HI (and less certainly, HII) velocity fields 
reveal  expansion,  with  the  velocity  reaching  ~30  km/s  at  a  distance  about  300  pc  from  the 
center of expansion, which is near the deep minimum position. The super star cluster is at the 
western  rim  of  the  minimum.    The  sharp  western  rim  of  the  whole  complex  is  plausibly  a 
manifestation  of  a  regular  dust  arc  along  the  complex  edge.  Different  hypotheses  about  the 
complex and the Vr depression’s origins are discussed, including a HVC/dark mini-halo impact, 
a BCD galaxy merging, and a gas outflow due to release of energy from the supercluster stars.  

1  INTRODUCTION 

            A bright isolated stellar complex shines in the outskirts of the spiral galaxy NGC 6946, 
about 5 kpc southwest of the galaxy centre. It was first reported by Hodge (1967), as an object 
somewhat  similar  to  the  system  of  the  giant  stellar  arcs  he  had  noted  in  the  LMC.  Thirty-two 
years  later  this  object  was  independently  found  by  Larsen  &  Richtler  (1999)  with  the  Nordic 
Optical Telescope (NOT); they described the complex as a round bright concentration of stars 
and  clusters  about  600  pc  in  diameter.  They  find  one  of  the  clusters  to  be  outstanding  by  its 
large size and brightness. The complex is remarkable also because of its sharp arc-like western 
edge, which is a 130-degree long segment of a regular circle (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. The peculiar complex  in NGC 6946. The  detail of image obtained at the Gemini North 
telescope (Gemini Observatories/AURA). The diameter of the complex is 22”. North at top, East to the 
left. 

          The properties of the star clusters in the complex have been first studied by Elmegreen et 
al.  (2000)  based  on  UBV  photometry  obtained  at  the  NOT.    Later  on    the  complex  was 
investigated in more detail  with the HST and Keck-I telescopes by Larsen et al. (2001, 2002), 
who  studied  the  star  formation  history  in  the  complex  and  determined  the  velocity  dispersion 
inside the giant cluster, its age (about 13 Myr) and luminosity (Mv = ~- 13.2). Its photometric and 
dynamical  masses  were  also  estimated  from  these  observations;  both  estimations  provide 
similar values close to 106 solar masses. It was possible therefore to suggest that the cluster is 
gravitationally bound and that it resembles a young globular cluster, eventually to evolve into an 
old  classical  globular  cluster.  Its  parameters  fit  those  for  giant  young  compact  clusters,  often 
called super star clusters (SSC).  
          Such clusters are commonly found in interacting galaxies and have been also detected in 
central  areas  of  galaxies  with  active  star  formation  (mostly  post-merging)  as  well  as  in  dwarf 
compact  galaxies.  However,  its  location  in  the  isolated    complex  of  peculiar  shape    in  the 
outskirts of a normal spiral galaxy makes this object peculiar.   Only half a dozen similar clusters 
are  known  in  such  galaxies,    most  of  these  being  less  massive      than  the  NGC  6946  cluster    
(Larsen  & Richtler,  2004). 
          The density  of  high luminosity stars  and clusters within  the Hodge complex is  so high 
that it may be classified as  a localized burst of recent  star formation,   the maximum   rate  of 
star  formation  there  being  some  30  Myr  ago    (Larsen    et  al.,    2002).      Such  star/cluster 
complexes (the younger of which are known also as super associations) are  very rare (one per 
cent of common complexes)  in normal galaxies  and  some  special   conditions  are  plausibly 
needed to trigger  a burst of star  formation  there  (Efremov,    2004a,b).  A smaller  version of 
the Hodge complex is known  in  M51,   it is the  G1 complex which is round and rather isolated,  
but  large clusters  are missing  there  (Bastian et al., 2005).   
          Long  slit  spectroscopy  along  three  selected  directions  was  obtained  with  the  6-m  BTA 
and  10-m  Keck-I telescopes (Efremov et al., 2002). The observed radial  velocity curves along 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 

the slits showed several dips and bumps superimposed on a smooth curve, compatible with the 
expected rotation curve for this region of the galaxy. The most intriguing feature of the spectra is 
the steep fall-off in the V(r)  curve at PA 83º, with a center 7" East of the SSC, in the region of 
the  lowest  brightness  of  Hα.  It  was  interpreted  as  the  outcome  of  an  expanding  semi-bubble.  
This  feature  has added one more peculiarity to the unique properties of the complex.  

The origin and evolution of the complex and  its  almost central SSC cannot be resolved 
without more detailed data on the kinematics and physics of the gas in and around the complex. 
To this end 3D spectroscopy of the ionized gas was carried out with the 6m BTA telescope of 
the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Observations and 
reduction have been done by V.L.Afanasiev. Data for HI gas in the region were also obtained, 
done  at  the  Westerbork  Synthesis  Radio  Telescope  (WSRT)  by  R.Boomsma  within  the 
framework  of  studies  of  the  whole  galaxy.  Some  results  obtained  by  E.J.Alfaro  and  B.García-
Lorenzo with the 4m WHT telescope (Roque de los Muchachos Observatory), N.Bastian  at the  
Gemini North telescope, and by S.Larsen at the Keck-II telescope are also presented.  

2 BTA observations and reductions  

      In August 2003 the complex was observed at the primary focus of the 6-m telescope  (BTA), 
using  the  Multi-Pupil  Fiber  Spectrograph  (MPFS)  (Afanasiev  et  al.  2001).  This  spectrograph 
gives  simultaneously  spectra  from  256  rectangular  cells,  1"  x  1"  in  size  each,  arranged  as  a 
rectangular matrix 16 x  16 squared arcsec. The detector was a CCD EEV42-40 (2048 x 2048 
pixels).  A  detailed  description  of  the  spectrograph  can  be  found  on  the  SAO  web-page 
(http://www.sao.ru/hq/lsfvo/devices/mpfs/mpfs_main.html).  

A  mosaic  of  four  frames  centered  on  the  SSC  position  was  obtained  together  with  two 
more  frames  at  east  and  north-east  locations  relative  to  the    SSC  center.  The  logbook  of  the 
observations is shown in Table 1, and the locations of the fields can be seen in Figs. 2 and 3.

         The  coordinates  of  the  centers  of  each  field  are  given  relative  to  the  SSC  center 
coordinates (RA 20h34m 32s.04; DEC +60º 08’ 14”.6; 2000.0). The observations were conducted 
with  two  diffraction  gratings:  600  rulings/mm  (dispersion  1.45  Ǻ/px)  and  1200  rulings/mm 
(dispersion  0.76  Ǻ/px).  The  first  grating  was  used  for  2D-spectrophotometery  in  the  studied 
fields,  and 
the 
field.  For 
for  analysis  of 
spectrophotometric standard stars G24-9 and BD+25º 4655 were used.

The reduction of the data was conducted by a standard mode (bias subtraction, cleaning 
for cosmic rays, correcting of geometrical and photometric distortion, wavelength and absolute 
flux  calibrations,  sky  background  subtraction)  through  the  software  package  MPFS_2K.lib, 
working in IDL. For every region, intensity line maps, intensity line ratio maps and velocity field 
maps were constructed from the cube of data. It is necessary to note, that because of the low 
line-of-sight  systemic  velocity  of  NGC  6946,  apart  from  the  typical  lines  of  hydroxyl,  the 
noticeable  line  of  telluric  Hα  is  very  close  to  the  emission  coming  from  the  target  galaxy.  To 
accurately remove this annoying sky line  we have used spectra from a separate field, distant 

 
 
 
 
 
far  enough  from  the  galaxy  (30').  Once  a  single  spectrum  of  the  sky  was  obtained,  it  was 
subtracted  from  the  2D-spectra  of  the  targets.  The  profile  of  the  Hα  emission  line  within  the 
complex was thus correctly isolated and defined.

3  OBSERVATIONAL RESULTS 

3.1 The  ionized gas data (BTA MPFS)  

3.1.1  Velocity  determinations 

         The velocity fields inside the complex and two nearby fields were obtained with the BTA 
MPFS  using  the  emission  lines  Hα,  [NII]  6548+6583  and  [SII]  6717+6731.  These  fields  are 
shown in fig.  2 and 3.   

Assuming  the  single  velocity  values  in  each  position,  the  errors  are  about  10  km/s  and 
comparison  with  the  long  slit  data  (figs.  4,  5,  6  in  Efremov  et  al..  2002)  demonstrates  a  good 
agreement  between  both  estimations.  A  roundish  depression  of  10  x  12"  (300  x  360  pc, 
assuming a 6.0 Mpc distance) in size is seen centered 7" east of the SSC, the radial velocity in 
its center being about 40 km/s, i.e. ~100 km/s smaller than that of the SSC and the neighboring 
gas. It is the cross-section of this depression by  the HII line-of-sight velocity curve along the PA 
83°    that  was    called  the  "fast  expansion"  in  Efrem ov  et  al.  (2002)  -  their  slit  at  PA  83°  very 
luckily intercepted this feature a bit to the North of its center. This feature is referred to below as 
the  “deep  dip”  or the  ”crater”  (Fig.  3).  A  smaller and  less  deep  depression  is  seen    NE  of  the 
complex  outside of it. Both features are within the region of the lowest Hα (and HI, see below) 
intensity at the star complex’s eastern border.  
          Two-component Gaussian  analysis  of emission profiles was carried out for the regions 
marked in Fig. 3 (right);  the resulting velocity distributions  are given in Fig. 4 and Table 2.

 The  observed  profiles  of  emission  lines  are  presented  there  as  the  superposition    of  two 
Gaussian curves.  The values of Vr for  each component  within the bright regions  1 – 5  in Fig. 
4  are rather  similar;  on average they are  +79 +/- 18 km/s  (the width is 225+/-23 km/s)  and  
+145 +/- 5  km/s (the width is 131+/-10 km/s). It is worth noting the  excellent agreement of the 
red velocity  with the SSC velocity,  +141 km/s (Larsen et al. 2006).

Fig. 4. The line of sight velocity distributions from the emission lines within the deep dip, the regions  
marked in the Fig. 3 (right) and  in the E1  and E2 outer fields. Representations by two Gaussians are 
given. The velocities mapped in Fig. 2 and 3 correspond to the barycentric (intensity weighted) velocities. 
See text and Table 2. 

Within      the  dip,    the  blue-shifted    component  of  the  emission  lines  is    wider  than  in  other    
regions.    It    corresponds  to    a  velocity  of  +13  km/s  (the  width  is  260  km/s),  whereas  the  red-
shifted  component  has  a velocity of +147 km/s and a width of 120 km/s, similar to values for 
the regions 1 – 5.   
          The  emission  line’s  barycentric  velocities  (i.e.  intensity  weighted,    obtained  as  those  Vr 
values, at both sides of which  the integrated  values of emission intensities are equal) within all 
6  areas  are    close  to  those  obtained  in  Efremov  et  al.  (2002)  and    correspond,  of  course,    to 
ones shown in  our  Figs. 2 and  3 above.   Taken at face value, the finding of two values of Vr 
with  similar  difference  inside  each    area    (about 60  km/s),  in  each  one  of  areas  1  –  5,    might  
imply that all  of these  areas are  rather close to the center of an expanding HII shell with  a 
systemic velocity ~112 km/s and a lower limit expanding velocity of ~30 km/s.     However, the 
red  components  over the  complex  are  about  the  same  and     closely  correspond  to  the     SSC 
velocity  and  to  the  average  HI  velocities  near  the  latter (but  outside  the deep  dip).    Note  also 
that (excluding the  dip region) the red components  are  stronger and narrower  than the blue 
ones.   The blue components are more different; region #4, closest to the supercluster, has a 
second  (after  the  dip)    blue    velocity  component.    Thus  the  overall  picture  looks  like  a  giant 
semi-shell with a  blue-shifted center and an outflow in the same direction.   This suggestion is 
consistent with the HI data, as will be discussed below.  

 
 
 
         The  night-sky  Hα  line  is  close  to  the  blue  side  of  the  Hα  line  of  NGC  6946  ,  and,  if  not 
properly subtracted,  might  shift  the barycentric velocity to a lower value, especially   in regions 
of  low  HII  gas  density.  This  has  led  to  wrong  conclusions  in  some  earlier  work  on  gas 
kinematics  in  NGC  6946,  as  described  by      Bonnarel  et  al.  (1988). We are  careful  to  exclude  
this possibility.   
           The  MPFS  results  were  obtained after careful  sky line subtraction, based on the  
spectrum  observed far from the galaxy, as was also done by Efremov et  all (2002).   A cross-
correlation of five emission lines was used, including the SII lines, which are completely 
uncontaminated by sky emission.

6730 Ǻ  are shown by vertical lines.  

3.1.2   Mechanism of ionization  

       From the ratio of emission line intensities within the deep dip ("fast expansion") Efremov et 
al. (2002) noted signatures of shock excitation in that region. With the BTA MPFS  data we are 
able to reinforce this conclusion strongly  and to obtain quantitative estimations.  Fig. 3 (right) is 
a monochromatic map of the complex in the Hα line, where the regions are marked within which 
the emission lines were studied in  detail. It is seen that the deep dip is near the center of a vast 
area in which the HII emission is quite low.  
         In  Table 3 and Fig. 6  the ratios of intensities of emission lines in these areas are given for 
[OIII] and [NII]  emission lines relative to Hα and Hβ.

The  dividing  line  between  photo-ionization  due  to  the  presence  of  hot  stars,  or  ionization 
produced by shock waves, is presented in  Fig. 6 according to the diagnostic tool, developed by 
Veilleux and Osterbrock (1987).  

Figure 6. The diagnostic diagram for the emission line ratios (MPFS) in the regions marked in Fig. 3 
(right). All ratios, except those for the deep dip region (shown as open circle), correspond to the ionization 
from hot stars, being to the left of the dividing curve. 

          The  line intensities  and  their ratio maps  are  presented in Fig. 7,  where  we can see 
how the low gas density (HII, NII and SII) is  associated with the  region of ionization by shocks. 
It  is  seen  also  that  ionization  by  shocks  appears  to  be  only  present  within  the  velocity  
depressions  - the deep dip and  a small region  north of it.

b) [SII] 6717 + 6731, c) [NII]/Hα, d) [SII]/Hα.  The contours  are Hα intensities.  Compare with Fig. 2. 

                 The  low  density  of  all  gas  species  within  the  deep  dip  region  leads  to  a  lower 
signal/noise  ratio  for  emission  line  intensities  there.  Because  of  this,  no  conclusion  was 
obtained for this region with the WHT INTEGRAL IFU data (see below).  However, as shown in 
Fig.  5  and  Table  3,  the  BTA  data  for  the  line  intensities      within  the  deep  dip  present    good 
    ratio  within  the  deep  dip  is 
enough  S/N    for  diagnostic  analysis.    It  is  seen  that  the  [NII]/Hα 
indeed larger than in all bright emission regions 1 – 5.   

The parameters of emission lines were also measured with the WHT in the same bright 
HII regions as ones measured with the BTA and were found to conform to expected ratios from 
photo-ionization (see below in Section 3.3). 
         It is worth noting that in the galaxy NGC 1084 (Moiseev, 2000) an increase of the [NII]/Hα 
ratio in the regions of ionized gas deviating from circular rotation was explained as  a signature  
of shock wave  fronts in these regions.

3.2 Velocity slice  through  the  deep dip (Gemini North) 

The  issue  of  the  radial  velocities    within  the  deep  dip    is  crucial    to  understand  this 
feature.  The relevant  data were obtained by  N. Bastian  at the Gemini  North telescope with 
the GMOS-N spectrograph on  the night of 2006-05-25.  The slit-width was set to 1", using the 
grating R831 centered around λ  6600Ǻ . This configuration provides a plate scale of 0.14"/pix 
and a dispersion of 1.3 Ǻ/pix, with a resolution of 3A around Ha. The total integration time was 
900 s. The spectral range was 5550 – 7600 Å.  No calibration in flux was done.   

The data were reduced using the standard Gemini reduction pipeline. 

First, only the Hα line profile was used, fitted with a single Gaussian, sky  line subtraction being  
done  from the outer part of the same long slit  spectrum, outside the main body of the galaxy.    
The slit position is shown in Fig. 8;  the resulting line-of-sight velocity   and flux profiles are in 
Fig.   9.    

Figure 8. The slit positions of BTA (used in Efremov et al. 2002) and Gemini North, overlaid onto the 
velocity field and R-band image. The Gemini  North slit goes through the deep dip at PA -50°. 

          We have also attempted to get line-of–sight velocities from the  lines of 
 [NII] 6584 and [SII] 6717, 6731,   which are well separated from any  
 significant telluric lines for the range of  velocities observed in the target spectrum.  Thus, we 
lose emission signal in favor of a better separation in the spectral axis  and    in favor of  being 
completely free from any sky line contamination.   
         In order to increase the signal to noise ratio of the 1D-spectra, we have binned  three rows 
along the spatial axis, leaving unaltered the spectral axis.        Line centroids, intensity peaks, 
line fluxes, FWHMs, and their corresponding errors, have been calculated making use of the 
DIPSO program in the STARLINK package. This analysis has been applied to the three 
emission lines mentioned above, as well as to two significant telluric lines within the analyzed 
spectral range.  The details of reduction will be published elsewhere (Sánchez-Gil et al., in 
preparation).   
          A weighted mean radial velocity curve has been calculated from the radial velocities of 
the individual lines weighted by the inverse of the radial velocity errors. The uncertainty of the 
mean radial velocity has been also calculated following classical statistical procedures. In the 
same way, the mean velocity dispersion and its error have been estimated from the same data  
(Fig. 10).

Figure 10. The data obtained with the Gemini North telescope from  the [NII] 
and   [SII] lines.  The  pixel numbers are the same as in Fig. 9. 

          It is important to note that the radial velocity curve  derived from forbidden lines (Fig. 10)  
agrees well with that obtained from the   Hα line  (Fig. 9). The somewhat lower velocities that 
are found from the forbidden lines within the regions of low flux may indicate a lower velocity of 
the shocked   clouds, like it was found in NGC 1084 galaxy (Moiseev, 2000). There is  also good 
agreement with velocities obtained from the MPFS  velocity   slice  along  the  Gemini  slit 
position (PA -50º).  Thus we may affirm   that our velocities are reliable even in the regions of  
the  lowest density of ionized gas.

3.3   The western rim 

          The western edge of the star/cluster complex is unusually sharp and lies along a circular 
arc 130-degree long (Fig. 1, 13, and 20). Such a regular stellar structural shape, to the best of 
our  knowledge,  is  otherwise  known  only  for  the  giant  stellar  arcs  in  the  LMC  (Hodge,  1967; 
Efremov,  2004b,c)  and  for  a  few  galaxies  which  appear  to  have  been  in  interaction  with    the 
IGM, such as NGC 2276 and DDO 265. In the latter cases the arc-like shape is evidently due to 
star formation, triggered in a bow shock by ram pressure along the galaxy’s leading edge. In a 
few other galaxies an arc-like (bow shock) shape is observed in the outer HI density contours 
(Efremov, 2002 and ref. therein).  

The issue arises whether this sharp regular edge is due to a large dust density along the 
western rim or it is the real shape of the star complex. In a map of extinction over the whole of 
NGC  6946,  constructed  from  B  and  K-band  photometry,  by  Trewhella  (1998),  an  arc  of  high 
extinction around the complex’s west edge may be noted, with AB being mostly between ~1.0-
2.0, whereas it is low in the central part of the complex. Similar but more detailed results were 
obtained from the HST stellar UBV photometry within the complex (Larsen et al. (2002).  

The  complex  was  observed  in  August  2003  by  E.Alfaro  and  B.García-Lorenzo  with  the 
INTEGRAL  device  at  the WHT  telescope. Within  the  bright  HII  regions  located  at  the  western 
and  southern  parts  of  the  complex,  the  light  absorption  based  on  the  Hα/Hβ  ratios  was 
determined and translated into magnitudes of B-band absorption;  the resulting map  is given in 
Fig. 11. 

Figure 11. Contours of AB light absorption based on WHT data. Values range from < 0.71m over most  the 
complex to > 2.85m  at  the upper right. The contours are overlaid onto the image from Fig. 2 left. The X,Y 
axes are in arc seconds,  the supercluster  is at (0, 0)  and  the deep dip centre  is at (-7, 0). 

It  is  seen  that    inside  the  bright  HII  regions    surrounding  the  star  complex  at  the West,   
AB values  are as large as 3.5m , whereas  inside  the complex  AB  is smaller  than  0.7m.   The 
bright HII region 4 (Fig. 3) is inside of the complex and  is unseen in Fig. 11.   

The      high  light  absorption  along  the  complex’s  western  edge  is  confirmed  by    Fig.  12,  
where the K-band image obtained by S.Larsen with the Keck-II telescope is given. The optical 
depth  in  the  K-band  being  10  times  smaller  than  in  the  B  band,  the  objects  behind  the  dust 
clouds may be seen and indeed, in Fig. 12 the complex has neither a sharp nor a regular edge  
at  the  west  or  anywhere  else.    These  results  suggest  that  the  arc-like  western  rim  is  mostly 
outlined  by  high  light  extinction,  as  was  proposed  earlier    (Elmegreen,  Efremov  &  Larsen,  
2000).

camera (SCAM) of the Nirspec spectrograph and is a sum of 3 exposures of 60 s each. The pixel scale is 
0.183"/pixel and the detector has 256x256 pixels, so the total field

14 

         The  older  red  supergiants  are concentrated  to  a  clump    between  the  western  rim  centre 
and the SSC, as is seen by eye (Fig. 13 left) and by star density averaging (Fig. 13 right) in the 
HST  data.  This  older  population  might  have  triggered  the  formation  of  a  younger  one,  which 
would  be  compatible  with  the  results  from  Larsen  et  al.  (2006),  who  found  a  super-solar 
[alpha/Fe] ratio, usually interpreted as a result of rapid, bursty star formation from gas enriched 
by a massive SNII. Indeed, the SF history inside the complex provides evidence for a maximum 
rate of star formation at least 10-15 Myr prior to the formation of the SSC (Larsen et al. 2002).   
        At any rate,   the spatial pattern formed by circular arrays of different aged stars,  observed 
in  Fig.  13  (see  also  Fig.  20  below),    is  difficult    to  explain.    What  is  still  surprising  is  that  the 
western rim of the complex, the circular arc, formed or not by dust, is   concentric to the arc of 
the bright blue stars inside the complex, the opening angle of both arcs being similar.  Also, the 
arcs of clusters are seen not only along the western rim, but  (shorter ones) at the complex east 
too,  again with the same centre,  which is also  the centre of the red supergiant  concentration.      
It is the red supergiant clump - and not the SSC  -  which  is the core of the Hodge complex.       

3.4   The HI gas data (WSRT) 

         Relevant data for our region were obtained by R.Boomsma while studying the distribution 
of HI over all of NGC 6946 using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT).  The 
results for all the galaxy  are given elsewhere  (Boomsma,  2007; Boomsma et al., in 
preparation).   It was found that the Hodge  complex is inside a region of low HI density, but  an 
oval  region of even  lower HI density (a hole) is seen to the east and northeast part of the 
complex  (Fig. 14) ,  being remarkably similar in position and shape  to the region of the shock 
excitation and low  ionized gas density, shown in the  Fig. 7.   
        This  HI hole   is #85 in the list of HI holes in NGC 6946  (Boomsma, 2007);   its size given 
there  is  1.4 x 1.0 kpc.    The hole is centered on the deep dip position and not the supercluster,    
the latter being   at the   western edge  of  the oval region of the lowest   HI and HII  density.     
The complex is surrounded with HII regions  (Fig.  14 and 15).

The low density regions are dark, the contours are for the R-band optical image.  Right: the Hα map

complex West are for HI densities around velocity 110 km/s (see Fig. 14), the ovals are approximate 
positions of HI holes, found in Boomsma (2007). 

          Figs. 16 and 17 compare the intensities and velocities of the HII and HI gas in the wide 
area surrounding the complex, demonstrating that the overall velocity of the HII and HI gas in 
the complex appears to be  in agreement  with the velocity of  the  surrounding regions, 
determined mainly by the galaxy rotation.

3.5   Gas velocity fields  

3.5.1   Circumcomplex shell expansion 

17 

We  are  now  in  position  to  compare  the  results  obtained  for  the  velocities  of  the  ionized  and 
neutral  gas  in  the  field  of  the  complex.    The  velocity  fields  of  HI    and      the  ionized  gas  are  
overlaid in Fig. 18.  The agreement is  mostly poor, as might be expected.  As we dealt  with the  
intensity-weighted    velocity  fields,      the  locations  of  velocity  extremes  in  the    sky    plane  is  a 
result from the interplay of respective  intensities  and velocities.  The rather low  HI resolution 
(13”  comparing  with  1’’  in  HII)  explains  why  the  most  remarkable  feature  of  the  ionized  gas 
velocity field, the deep dip, is unseen in HI velocity map,  though it is observed in the HI velocity 
slices. 

Figure 18.  The velocity fields for HI (WSRT, the ticked contours) and ionized gas (BTA, colored areas, 
see  Fig. 2, right).  The position of the supercluster  (at 0,0) is marked by the cross, the deep dip is the 
blue spot. The line of the largest gradient in the HI velocity field is shown, its PA= -30°. The conti nuous 
faint contours in the insert are for the HII emission intensity. The HI Vr contour lines have tics to the lower 
velocity side. 

The  line  going   through the local HI  velocity extremes in Fig. 18 (left), has the position 
angle    PA  -30°,  which  is  close  to the  orientation o f  the galaxy      kinematical  minor  axis:    -  32° 
from HII data (Bonnarel et al., 1988) and  -38° fro m  HI  (Boomsma, 2007).  A similar  velocity 
gradient is seen also  in the ionized gas velocity curve  for PA  -37°,  at a distance  -20” -- +10”    
from the SSC  ( Efremov et al., 2002, fig. 6 bottom), and it may be suspected also in the velocity 
field of the ionized gas. (Otherwise the respective features in the latter might be a part of the Hα 
velocity bump, surrounding the dip; see Fig. 19).  

The orientation of the line of maximum velocity gradient close to that of the galaxy minor 
axis is a signature of either expansion or contraction within the galaxy plane (see for example 
fig. 5 in Begum and Chengalur,  2003).  Considering that the near  side of  NGC 6946 is in the 
NW and  the Vr local minima is also at that side (Fig. 18),  the conclusion is that we are dealing 
with  expansion.    The  position    of  the  center  of  expansion      (the    point  at  the    line  of  maxima 
gradient  equally distanced  from maxima (150 km/s) and minima (120 km/s) closed contours of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 

Vr)   has the intermediate Vr = 135 km/s; the center is closer to the deep dip than  to the SSC 
(Fig. 18).   The velocity of the SSC is quite close  to the  median value between these extreme   
velocities;  according to  the recent determination by Larsen et al. (2006) it is  141 +/- 2 km/s, 
based on Keck IR spectra of the red supergiants in the SSC.    

The  extreme  difference  of    HI    velocities  along  the  line  of  maxima  gradient  is  30  km/s 
and, assuming  the galaxy  gas disk inclination is 38º ,   this Vr gradient might point to expansion 
of the HI gas in the plane of the galaxy with a velocity  ~30  km/s.     

  This value  is  the same as the one suggested by the splitting of emission lines  in the  
bright  HII  regions    1—5  (see  above,  Section    3.1).    This  evidently  implies  that  the  HI  and  HII 
supershells  expand  with  the  same    velocity.    Note  that  the    higher    (redder)  velocity  of  HI  is 
close  to  the  local  rotational  velocity  of  the  galaxy,    whereas  the  smaller  (blue)  is  much  lower.  
The same is true for the ionized gas velocities. 

Large negative deviations  are seen in velocity  slices  of both HI and ionized gas  in  the 

deep dip position and around it  (Fig. 19).  

Figure 19. The HI and Hα velocity curves along the PA 83°, going through th e SSC and the deep dip 
positions. HI (WSRT data, wide strip) and Hα (data from fig. 4b in Efremov et al. 2002, crosses) velocities 
curves demonstrate  the crater-like appearance. East to the left, 0 is at the SSC position. 

         The  features    of    these    slices  are  in  general  agreement  with  the    double  values  of 
velocities  of  the  ionized  gas,  found  in  Section  3.1    within    the  deep  dip  and    the  bright  HII 
regions.  Also,   the  HI holes or loops are  seen in each  of the HI slices through  the SSC  at 
locations of HI  density minimum  (Fig. 21 below).      
            We may conclude that the overall agreement of   the neutral and ionized gas line-of-sight 
velocities  suggests the expansion of a  circumcomplex  shell with velocity  ~30 km/s, although 
the picture is surely more complicated. The  red velocities of both ionized and neutral gas  are 
rather similar in different positions  , whereas  the blue ones are quite different.  
          The    largest  degree  of  shock  ionization  observed  just  at  the  deep  dip  position  (Fig.  7) 
might  imply  that  we  observed  there  the  shocked  remnants  of    impacting  clouds  which  have 
passed through the galaxy gas disk  and have triggered the expansion of the supershell. 

3.5.2    One-sided outflow from the circumcluster shell? 

         However, another explanation is  possible  for the nature  of the deep dip. It may be  the 
manifestation of a fountain of gas that was  blown out from the  galaxy disk  by the  pressure 
from the hot stars and the SNe  of the supercluster.  
          Earlier the  pressure from the SSC  and the non-uniform density in the ISM within the 
complex  were  suggested (Efremov et al. 2002)  to explain the  “fast  expansion” (called here 
the deep dip)  and its position far from the SSC.    These authors found also a  shell of HII gas 

 
 
 
 
 
       
 
19 

around the supercluster with radius ~6” (the circumcluster shell).    Now   we note    that  the 
distance  between the centers of the  dip  and  the supercluster  is the same 6 or 7”.   This   
suggests   that the  deep dip  is  nothing but a manifestation of the blow-   out  of the 
circumcluster shell from the (inclined) complex gas plane.   
        In this case we have  not  two shells, the  fast expansion  and the  circumcluster shell,  
(apart from the encompassing  HII/HI  supershell),  but  we  observe (as  the fast expansion)  
the break-through of the single circumcluster shell.  The outflow  is one-sided because the 
supercluster is  closer to the near side of the  gas layer,  the  distance of the supercluster  to this  
effective edge of the  gas  disc layer being  a bit  smaller than the present day radius of the 
circumcluster  shell.   The break site is located rather far (at 7”) from the supercluster because   
the gas disc   of the complex is inclined to the sky   plane.   We may be observing a classical 
chimney, produced by the energy output from the  supercluster, as was found in the NGC 1705 
dwarf galaxy, which also hosts a supercluster (Meurer et al., 1992). 
           The   bump  in the Hα and  HI velocity curves,  at the top of which is the dip (Fig.  19),   
might  then  be explained   by the returning motions of the gas clouds,  which were  blown  out 
through  the chimney earlier.    These clouds are naturally expected to be located more or less 
symmetrically around the chimney axis.   The latter, being orthogonal to the complex gas plane, 
is inclined to the line of sight and this  may explain  the asymmetrical appearance   of the 
velocity dip walls in Figs. 2 and 9.   The shock waves in the blown-out region  explain the shock 
ionization in this region. (Note,  anyway,  that all these features are seen also in some  models 
of a HVC impact (Santillán et al. 1999). 
           The    outflow  hypothesis    seems  to  have  a    confirmation.  As  is  seen  in  Fig.  20,      the  
complex  is bordered by a nearly regular circle, in spite of the galaxy plane inclination  being 38°  
(Boomsma  2007).  We  cannot  believe    the  star  complex  is  a  spherical  feature  (the  complex 
diameter  is  larger than the  thickness  of the  young  stellar  disc),  and  at this    inclination  a  circle  
within the galaxy plane should look like  an ellipse,   the  minor axis tips of which  should be  at 
the ticks  imaged  in Fig.  20. 

Figure 20. The cenhanced  image of the  complex . The circle around the complex has the diameter 22” = 
660 pc at 5.9 Mpc (Karachentsev et al.  2000). The position angle of major axis is 62°, minor  axis -2 8°, 
the galaxy inclination is 38° (Boomsma  2007). The  position of the deep dip is shown by the oval. See 
text. 

In order to see the observed circular edge, the complex plane should be tilted  by some  40°   in 
respect to the main plane of the galaxy, having the node line almost parallel to the minor axis of 
the galaxy. Otherwise, it may be the local corrugation of the galaxy plane in the complex region.  
These    corrugations  are    the  common  features  of  galactic  discs,  including  ours    (Alfaro  et  al. 
2001).    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20 

              Due to the complex plane  inclination  we do not see the site of the gas break-through 
from  the circumcluster shell  just at the supercluster position.   This site should be shifted along 
the direction, parallel to the galaxy minor axis (due to the general galaxy disk inclination), and 
also  along  the  direction,  parallel    to  the  galaxy  major  axis  (due  to  the  suggested    local  plane 
inclination in relation to the NGC 6946 disc).   The  observed position of the break-through hole  
in the shell  should be  then  somewhere  between  the  major and minor axes of the complex  
image,  which is indeed  observed (Fig. 20).           
           The  complicated  evolution  of  the  ISM  under  the  influence  of  the  stellar  winds  and 
supernovae  of a supercluster  was  modeled   in Tenorio-Tagle et al.  (2006); they found that 
multiple shells  within shells must be formed.  Such a picture may correspond to our observed  
circumcluster and circumcomplex shells and also to structures, seen in the x, Vr  plane  in Figs.   
19 and 21.    Kinematical evidence for multiple shells  around OB-associations and the related 
mechanism  of  triggered    star  formation  was  suggested  by  Chernin  &  Lozinskaya    (2002).  Of 
course the NGC 6946 supercluster is older than clusters considered in  both  models. 

3.5.3   The analogy between the Hodge and the Gould complexes  

        Assuming  that  tilt  and  gas  outflow  exist  in  the  NGC  6946  complex,    we  note  that  rather 
similar  features  were  found  in  the  Gould  Belt.    The    angle    of  its  plane  to  the  Galactic  one  is   
18º   (Pöppel 1997;  Perrot &  Grenier, 2003; Elias et al. 2006),  and two gas chimneys have 
been   found to  outflow  in the opposite directions, orthogonal to the Gould Belt plane,  to which  
the gas clouds and the younger stars  concentrate (Lallement  et al. 2003).     
          Thus we suggest    that the Hodge complex might be  a structure   rather similar to the 
Gould Belt, a star complex which the Sun lies within. The latter was probably formed as a result 
of an impact of a supercloud  (Wesselius & Feijes,  1973;  Comeron & Torra,  1992, 1994;  see 
also discussion in  Pöppel, 1997) and this might also be the case for the Hodge complex.   The 
important difference is, of course, the presence of the very rare object – a supercluster – in the 
NGC 6946 complex.    
          Is the Gould belt complex as a whole detached kinematically from the surrounding  stuff 
of the Galaxy?   Recently Bobylev (2006)  has used 49 clusters to determined the mean motion 
of the Gould Belt complex relative to the local standard of rest,  its velocity being  10.7 km/s  
and  the velocity vector lying  within the Galaxy plane.   Such a direction of peculiar motion 
cannot be seen in NGC 6946.  Seemingly nothing (apart from expansion) is known about the 
bulk motion  of the ISM  of  the  Gould complex.   However, for the gas in the Hodge   complex   
we may affirm that the systematic difference is small, if any; surely  nothing is known about the 
velocities of its stars and clusters (apart from the SSC).  The virial mass  of the  Gould belt  (1.5  
x  106  suns,  Bobylev 2006)  is lower than the stellar mass  of the  Hodge complex  (~107  suns,   
Larsen  et al.  2002). 

4 DISCUSSION 

4.1 The hypotheses of impact   

 We  consider first  the  suggestion  that     the    morphology    and    gas    velocity  field  of  the 
Hodge complex is due to the impact  of objects, coming either  from the halo of the galaxy or 
from the intergalactic medium (IGM).  As we have noted above, in some ways this complex is 
similar to the Gould belt complex,   for which  such an origin was suggested long ago.  

 There are more than a hundred HI holes in NGC 6946, some of which are accompanied 
by  HI  clouds  with  deviating  velocities  that    are  plausibly  responsible  for  the  respective  hole 
formation  (Boomsma  et  al.  2004;  Fraternali  et  al.  2004;  Boomsma  2007).      This  might  be  the 
case also for the  hole  #85  (Boomsma 2007),    surrounding the Hodge complex  and  centered 
on the deep dip.   

The shock ionization within the deep dip seems to agree with this suggestion, in spite of 
the  fact  that  such  ionization  is  expected  to  be  observable  for  a  rather  short  time.  After  the 
impact,  long  standing  interactions  of the  shock  waves,  triggering  star formation, may  exist,  as 
Santillán et al. (1999) have shown.

Some properties of the Hodge complex are really unique; therefore, the event which has 
triggered its formation might be also rare. Perhaps this is an example of a dark matter mini-halo 
impact  which  is  able  to  trigger  local  star  formation  and  produce  the  hole  in  the  gas  disc  of  a 
galaxy;  the gravitational effects of “dark impact” are noted by the galaxy disc both before and 
after      the  impact  itself  (Bekki  &  Chiba,  2006).    Low-mass  dark  matter  haloes  are  suggested 
(Braun  &  Burton,  1999;  Burton  &Braun,  2000)  to  be  associated  with  a  population  of  compact 
high velocity HI clouds  (CHVCs).   Recently  Thilker  et al. (2004)  concluded that  over 80% of  
95  HVC  which they detected  within 100 kpc around of M31   are of the  CHVC class.  Such 
mini-haloes/CHVCs  might be  quite numerous around large galaxies and  associated with the 
smallest spheroidal  dwarf galaxies  (Kleyna et al. 2005). 

The Hodge complex is located exactly in the centre of the "galactic coronal hole", the vast 
region, over which the magnetic field is oriented along the line of sight, i.e. at an inclination of 
~60°   to the plane of the galaxy (Beck, 1991, 2007).  Might both the vast “coronal hole” and  our 
complex  be    formed  as  a  result  of  the  passage  of  a  dark  mini-halo  (coupled  with  baryonic 
matter)  through the galaxy disk?      

In the   dark impact scenario,  the  impact would first provide the density enhancement 
necessary  to  trigger  star  formation  and  only  later  lead  to  the  hole  formation  (Bekki  &  Chiba, 
2006). The HI cloud velocities mostly follow the local HII velocities, as is seen in  Fig. 19, and 
they  might  be  the  NGC  6946  clouds  directed  by  the  impacted  dark  matter’s  gravitation.    The 
shock ionization around the deep dip position points to the presence of baryonic matter in the 
impacted clouds, as is expected.  
      All HI velocity  slices  through the SSC position (Fig. 21)  reveal   HI clouds, the  velocities of 
which   deviate  to lower  values than  the local galactic rotation.   This  is often observed  near  
HI  holes  in  NGC  6946  (Boomsma  2007),    and  is  seen  also  in  Fig.  16.  We  suggest    that    this 
might  be due to cloud movements  under  gravitation of massive impacted bodies.

supercluster is in the center of the field-wide cross.

      At  any  rate,  in  the  giant  expanding    hole/supershell  in  M101,  which  was  surely  formed  by 
stellar activity  the  cloud velocities deviate to both directions (Kamphuis et al. 1991).  Recent 
studies  suggest  that      subhaloes  of  dark  matter  inside  large  galaxies  might  be  much  more 
numerous  than  was  believed  (  Madau,  2007).  The  impact  hypothesis    is  compatible    with  
evidence  for  IGM    accretion    onto  the  NGC  6946  disk,  such    as  the  existence  of  a  HI 
protuberance  to the NW of NGC 6946, which might be the remnant of an accreted dwarf galaxy 
(Boomsma et al. 2004: Boomsma, 2007).    

The impacting  object, whether or not connected  with dark matter,  might   be a compact 
dwarf galaxy,  like one which  was suggested  to have triggered the formation  of a star-forming 
complex  in NGC  4559  (Soria et al. 2005). These authors  noted that the Hα  image suggests  
that the complex has  a ring-like appearance and a possibly responsible satellite dwarf is seen   
nearby.  

Recently, another   galaxy, NGC 922, was  suspected to form its very regular C-shaped   
eastern rim (quite  similar to the western rim of the Hodge complex) as a result of a high-speed  
drop-through    collision    of  a  small  galaxy,  seen  near  NGC  922      at  the  side  opposite  to  its 
eastern rim (Wong et al., 2006).  The relative position and  the arc-like rim’s  orientation  there 
are the  same as  for  our complex’s  western rim and  the deep dip.  The star-forming eastern 
rim of NGC 922 was suggested to have arisen as a result of a shock wave, expanded over NGC 
922 after the collision. The same origin is possible for the western rim of the Hodge complex, 
and    probably    of  the  whole  complex  with  its  SSC  and    the  regular  patterns  of    young  stars 
inside it.  

The star forming ring within the peculiar  galaxy Arp 10 was studied  recently  by Bizyaev, 
Moiseev,  &  Vorobyov  (2007).    They  found  clear  evidence  for      the  presence  of  an  impacting 
small  galaxy,  projected  still  on  Arp  10,  and  evidently  responsible  for  the  propagating  star 
formation in the latter.  

   Anyway, we note that we do not see a potentially responsible galaxy  near enough to 

NGC 6946.   

4.2  Merging or projecting BCD galaxy  

          We have noted the striking similarity of the Hodge complex to the NGC 1705 BCD galaxy, 
both having an SSC and a size around 0.7 - 1 kpc. This was one of the reasons to suggest that 
the complex might be in fact a foreground or merging BCD galaxy, the other reason being the 
absence of a HI hole around the supercluster  (Efremov et al. 2004).    

          Now, however, an HI hole has been found around the complex, though not centered on 
the SSC.  Also, the similarity  (outside the dip) between  the velocities of  the star complex (that 
of HI, HII and  the SSC) and surrounding NGC 6946 gas, as well as the absence of  evidence 
for any additional gas density in the complex,  make this hypothesis rather improbable.  

4.3 Nothing special?  

        The  peculiar  complex  hosting  the  SSC  might  be    just  a    result  of  processes  common  in 
spiral  galaxies.  A  massive  gas  cloud  is  easier  to  form  at  the  tip  of  a  density  wave  spiral  arm; 
later on it might undergo an instability event and form a first generation of stars (Elmegreen et 
al.  2000).    The  large  amount  of  energy  and  momentum  released  into  the  ISM  by  several 
generations  of  stars    (especially  those  in  the  SSC),  might  generate  a  hole/shell    whose 
expansion is  observed both in HI and ionized gas.  A (one-sided) gas outflow  might  then be 
formed, as suggested in Section  3.5.2.      
          At any rate,   the explanation of the deep dip feature  in the velocity field is an issue not  
directly connected with  the formation mechanism of the complex and the SSC.   The source of 
energy for the rapid  motion of HII and HI clouds inside the complex might well be the SSC, but  
this    may  tell  nothing  about  the  formation  of  the  latter.    It  is  necessary  to  explain  why  such 
complexes are not quite numerous at the tips of spiral arms.   Lastly, the complex is  at the tip of 
a short spur,   not  of a density wave spiral arm (see Fig. 1).

5  SUMMARY 

         Let  us  summarize  the  observed  data  on  kinematics  and  flux  distribution  of  ionized  and 
neutral gas in the Hodge complex region. An oval depression in line-of-sight velocities of ionized 
gas, about 300 pc across, is seen to the east of the supercluster, the velocity of the ionized gas 
in its center being ~100 km/s blue-shifted.  A symmetrical smaller  red-shift of the line-of-sight 
velocity  at  both  of  the  depression    sides  gives  the  HII  velocity  slice  a  crater-like  appearance. 
The SSC is ~200 pc from the crater center and the latter (not the SSC) is near the center of a 
much larger  HI hole.  
           The  velocity  field  of  HI  gas  reveals  a  gradient  in  the  SE  --  NW  direction,  which  is 
compatible  with  gas  expansion  within  the  NGC  6946  plane,  its  center  being  again  near  the 
crater.   In the intensity weighted HI velocity field there is no feature corresponding to the crater, 
because  of  the  13"  resolution  of  HI  data  (equal  to  the  crater  size).    However,  HI  clouds  with 
large negative velocities  are seen  there in the velocity slices.   

The peculiar complex  hosts  a supercluster and the velocity dip inside the encompassing 
expanding  HI/HII  hole.  We  cannot    conclusively  dterminewhich  event  was  the  first  to  trigger 
these  features.  The  most  simple  explanation  might  be  the  origin  of  the  SSC  inside  a  high 
pressure complex (plausibly the result of an impact) and then the  release of   energy of its stars 
seen  as  the  velocity  dip  rather  far  from  the  cluster,  due  to  the  inclined    gas  plane    of  the 
complex.  The gas outflow  might  not be bi-lateral if the SSC is outside the mid-plane of the gas 
disc. The impact event might explain  the regular arc-like   shape of the complex’s  western rim  
and  regular structures inside the complex.   

 In many respects – the SSC formation excluded – the scenario for the formation of the 
Hodge complex as a result of an impact event may resemble  those suggested for the formation 
of the Gould Belt complex  in the Milky Way galaxy.  The tilt of the resulting  complex plane after 
an oblique impact  and the active star formation  are  the intrinsic properties of such a  scenario 
(Comeron  &  Torra  1992,  1994).    The  formation  as  a  result  of  a  gas  cloud  impact  has  been 
suggested also for an isolated star complex in M83 (Comeron, 2001). 

  The  SSC    might    be  formed    due  to    post-impact    shock  wave    collisions    (Chernin, 
Efremov  &  Voinovich  1995),  which  are  suggested  in  Santillán  et  al.  (1999),    and      connected 
high gas pressure, which is favorable for the formation of massive but still bound clusters (e.g. 
Elmegreen & Efremov 1997). 

 Both spots  with maximal deviations of the ionized gas velocity  are inside the HII hole at 
the complex’s eastern part  -  they are  the  “crater”  and a much smaller spot  near the hole’s 
NE    edge.    Both  these  spots  are  also  those  that  demonstrate  the  maximal  degree  of  shock 
excitation.    In  the  framework  of  the  impact  hypothesis,  the  deviating  gas  velocities  might  be 
velocities of clouds which have passed through the galaxy disk. However, the shock excitation 
may  also  reveal  the  condition  of  gas  clouds  in  the  outflow  from  the  surroundings  of  the 
supercluster.    The      crater-like  velocity  feature        is  then  explained  by    the    (one-sided)  gas  
outflow,  driven by pressure from the SSC, as was   observed in  the galaxy NGC 1705 (Meurer 
et al. 1992, 1998).   

All  in  all,  the  impact  origin  seems  to  be  the  most  plausible  explanation  for  the  Hodge 
complex, especially considering that it hosts a supercluster and a surprisingly regular  C-shaped 
rim.  Most of the detected features of its gas kinematics might be due to the stellar winds and 
SNe from the supercluster.  We note in conclusion that until now the feature found 40 years ago 
in NGC 6946 is still the most enigmatic stellar system in the Local Universe, being similar in this 
relation only to the system of  the giant star/cluster arcs in the LMC,  also noted in  the same 
paper by Hodge (1967). 

Modeling  of  the  impact  of  HI  clouds  and  dark  mini-haloes  in  terms  of  the  observables 
(line-of-sight  velocities  versus  coordinates  on  the  sky)  will  be  necessary  to  compare 
meaningfully the theoretical predictions with the observational data.  We need also deeper and 
more  wide-field  stellar  data  as  well  as  higher  resolution  data  on  HII,  HI  and  CO  fluxes  and 
velocities.    The  issue  of  the  origin  of  the  features  of  the  Hodge  complex  is  crucial  for 
understanding the contemporary formation of supermassive bound clusters.
