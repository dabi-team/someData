ABSTRACT

1 INTRODUCTION

This paper investigates how the size of virtual space and objects
within it affect the threshold range of relative translation gains, a
Redirected Walking (RDW) technique that scales the user’s move-
ment in virtual space in different ratios for the width and depth.
While previous studies assert that a virtual room’s size affects rela-
tive translation gain thresholds on account of the virtual horizon’s
location, additional research is needed to explore this assumption
through a structured approach to visual perception in Virtual Reality
(VR). We estimate the relative translation gain thresholds in six
spatial conditions conﬁgured by three room sizes and the presence
of virtual objects (3 × 2), which were set according to differing An-
gles of Declination (AoDs) between eye-gaze and the forward-gaze.
Results show that both size and virtual objects signiﬁcantly affect
the threshold range, it being greater in the large-sized condition and
furnished condition. This indicates that the effect of relative trans-
lation gains can be further increased by constructing a perceived
virtual movable space that is even larger than the adjusted virtual
movable space and placing objects in it. Our study can be applied to
adjust virtual spaces in synchronizing heterogeneous spaces without
coordinate distortion where real and virtual objects can be leveraged
to create realistic mutual spaces.

Redirected Walking (RDW) is a locomotion method for Virtual
Reality (VR) based on natural walking. It allows movement in a
virtual space larger than the physical space a user is in, and can
be used to synchronize a virtual space and a physical space that
have different spatial conﬁgurations. Of the two main approaches
to RDW–adjusting rotation gains or translation gains–the majority
of studies on RDW have been focused on the former than the latter
on account of the fact that applying rotation gains can modify the
virtual space to a greater degree than applying translation gains.
However, RDW based on rotation gains often requires instant reposi-
tioning to avoid intermittent collisions with obstacles in the physical
world, which breaks the sense of immersion. Moreover, whereas
the coordinate systems of the real space and virtual space are prone
to error, translation gain modiﬁcation methods can generate a uni-
ﬁed coordinate system for both spaces without collision. Therefore,
translation gain-based RDW is more appropriate in situations where
heterogeneous spaces are converged into a single space for users to
share an immersive experience. To increase the effect of modifying
a VR client’s remote space for optimized mutual space generation,
the concept of relative translation gains was proposed to scale the
user’s movement in a virtual space in different ratios for the width
and depth [24].

In order to apply relative translation gains for RDW, it is nec-
essary to estimate the user’s threshold range, which refers to the
extent to which a user’s walking speed can be changed to adjust the
virtual movable space without the user noticing the difference in the
distance traveled. Previous studies have shown that RDW thresholds
are affected by visual cognitive elements such as visual composition
of Virtual Environments (VEs) or distractors [25, 35, 48]. In the case
of relative translation gains, Kim et al. [24] found that the threshold
range is greater in a large virtual space than in a small one and
inferred that the virtual horizon, located higher in the larger space,
may have caused users to become more insensitive to changes in
their in walking speed therein [52]. However, they did not present
any quantitative data regarding how the users actually perceived
the virtual horizon to support this assumption. Although the user’s
spatial perception of VEs is essential in estimating the RDW thresh-
old range, research focused on the relationship between these two
factors has been lacking.

In this study, we explore how the size dimensions and presence
of objects conﬁguring a virtual space affect the threshold range of
relative translation gains. Based on Kim et al.’s [24] study, we set
up six experimental conditions by combining three different room
sizes (Large, Medium, Small) with the presence of objects (Empty,
Furnished). The size conditions were set to disparate the location of
virtual horizon and the arrangement of objects were set to affects the
Angle of Declination (AoD) between eye-gaze and the forward-gaze.
We employed a mixed-subject method where three size conditions
were conducted within-subject and the presence of objects proceeded
with between-subject. Based on the user’s pseudo-Two-Alternative
Forced-Choice (pseudo-2AFC) responses on how they felt about
their perceived speed in VR, we estimated the threshold range by
ﬁtting it to the standard logistic psychometric function. In addition,
we measured the actual distribution of AoDs among users for all
conditions to analyze the acquired data with regard to the threshold
range.

Our statistical results show that both virtual room size and the
presence of objects signiﬁcantly affect the threshold range: The
threshold range was biased to be greater in Large condition than
in the Small and Medium conditions, and the Furnished condition
increased the threshold range to a greater degree than the Empty
condition. The distributions of AoD in empty rooms show that users
tended to focus their gaze on the virtual horizon for all sizes, which
indicates that the size of the room indeed affected the user’s visual
perception of the space and ultimately the threshold range. On the
other hand, the tendency was not apparent in the furnished rooms,
where objects functioned more as distractors that contributed to a
relative insensitivity to changes in the user’s walking speed rather
than as blockages to the virtual horizon that decreased the AoD.

Based on our ﬁndings, we suggest two design implications to
generate virtual spaces where the movable space can be increased to
a greater degree with RDW through relative translation gains. First,
the perceived movable space in VR should be larger than the adjusted
movable space, as illustrated in Figure 1(B). Second, objects should
be placed in the virtual space to increase the relative translation
gains further and expand the adjusted movable space, as shown in
Figure 1(C). Our study ﬁndings can be applied to create realistic
mutual spaces for remote collaboration by adjusting heterogeneous
VR clients’ spaces with relative translation gains and utilizing the
presence of real and virtual objects.
2 BACKGROUND

2.1 Redirected Walking Techniques

Various Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques have been intro-
duced to allow users to move around in a more expansive virtual
space beyond the limits of physical space, enabling immersive VR
experiences [8, 26, 36, 38]. Some applied curvature gains to steer
users to the center of the room or a speciﬁc target point [12, 20].
There were also RDW techniques with translation gain to move users
quickly in large-scale virtual spaces [21] and analyzed the strength
and weakness of translation gain-based locomotion methods accord-
ing to the location of the eye-level and the virtual space’s scale [1].
RDW methods have also been proposed to construct virtual spaces
during a scan and understand the user’s physical space [32]. Dong
et al. [16] introduced Smooth Assembly Mapping (SAM), which
decomposes large VE to smaller local patches and mapping together
into a real workspace. For multi-user scenarios, Azmandian et al. [4]
explored immersive VR experiences for redirected walking for two
users in the same physically tracked space, and Lee et al. [27] used
reinforcement learning in a multi-user environment with heteroge-
neous physical space.

In addition, Bachmann et al. [5] used artiﬁcial potential ﬁelds to
apply RDW and reset algorithms that consider physical obstacles
and users. More recently, Williams et al. [47] proposed an alignment-
based redirection controller called ARC, displaying the state-of-art
performance of real-time, space-adaptive redirection technique that

enables free movement. Such redirection techniques using rotational
gains [29, 31] were effective in expanding explorable VEs. However,
they are prone to collision with the physical environment in free
walking scenarios. While RDW using rotation gains is beneﬁcial
to increase the size of the virtual movable space, RDW based on
translation gains is advantageous in converging spaces with dis-
similar conﬁgurations into space with uniﬁed coordinate system.
Although translation gain and rotational gain were utilized together
to link spatial information between real and virtual spaces in some
cases [45, 47], research focused on translation gains and their po-
tential as an RDW method for mutual space generation has been
scarce.

2.2 Threshold Estimation and Perception

In order to leverage RDW, it is essential to obtain a threshold range
within which users will not be aware of the change in their walking
speed. Previous redirection controllers have mostly focused on in-
creasing the adjusted movable area in virtual space or minimizing the
number of instance redirections, but did not consider the acceptable
range of gains applied to RDW. Estimating this threshold range is
necessary because when the user recognizes the difference between
their real and virtual movements during RDW, their cognitive per-
formance is affected [9, 39, 41]. Steinicke et al. [44] ﬁrst proposed a
RDW threshold estimating method based on measuring the proba-
bilities of users’ responses regarding their perceived movement in
VEs. Following this study, several studies revisited the concept of
threshold range with current VR HMD devices [18, 50], and some
others showed that the threshold range for curvature gains could be
increased with repeated RDW trials or continuous walking [7, 51],
implying that more substantial curvature gain values can be obtained
and applied when users grow more familiar with RDW in VE.

Regarding how user perception of VEs affects threshold range
values, various cognitive factors were explored, such as the sense
of embodiment and the visual composition of VEs [25, 33, 35, 37].
Other studies attempted to explore how the size and layout of phys-
ical tracked space inﬂuence the performance of redirected walk-
ing controllers [3, 31]. In terms of visual perception in VR, pre-
vious studies stated users’ tend to underestimate virtual walking
speeds [2, 6, 10, 11] and the presence of distractors in VEs bias the
threshold range to be larger [14,15,17,48]. While Nguyen et al. [34]
reported that a room’s dimension does not signiﬁcantly affect curva-
ture gain thresholds, Kim et al. [24] stated that relative translation
gain thresholds differ according to the VE size and referred to Mess-
ing et al. [30] in assuming that this may be induced by the location
of the virtual horizon. While these studies addressed the relationship
between visual perception and threshold range, none of them utilized
quantitative data for more detailed and precise analyses.

2.3 Relative Translation Gains

Relative translation gains is an extended concept of translation gain
that enables spatial deformation without coordinate distortion and
enables more space-adaptive modiﬁcation than uniform translation.
Unlike other studies that investigated curvature gain, which utilizes
translation gains and rotational gains together, Kim et al. [24] sug-
gested relative translation gains, which refer to a pair of translation
gains that are applied to the width and depth axes of a plane, respec-
tively, as a method of adjusting the size of virtual spaces. Following
Kim et al.’s [24] deﬁnition, the ratio of the two translation gains in a
single pair of relative translation gains (2D translation ratio (αT )) is
represented as follows:

αT =

gT,x
gT,y

(1)

where gT,x is the VR environment’s x-axis translation gain, and
gT,y is the VR environment’s y-axis translation gain used as the refer-
ence translation gain. A relative translation gain threshold consists of

two boundary values: maximum 2D translation ratio and minimum
2D translation ratio. In the range between two values of relative
translation gain thresholds, a suitable value gT,x can be selected to
modify the VR user’s space to generate an optimal virtual movable
space. By applying relative translation gains, the VR user’s movable
space can be rescaled while sustaining the alignment of the coordi-
nate system between the physical and virtual space. Furthermore,
relative translation gains can be utilized to create mutual spaces for
immersive remote collaboration, as it does not incur sudden changes
to the coordinate system.

Kim et al. [24] estimated the threshold range of relative translation
gains in two differently sized virtual rooms where the larger room
(8 m × 6 m) was four times bigger than the smaller one (4 m ×
3 m). The two estimated 2D translation ratio values consisting
relative translation gain thresholds in the large virtual room were
0.85 (lower) and 1.29 (upper). This indicates that the participants’
perceived speed in a virtual environment can be changed from the
actual speed to be 15% slower or 29% faster without them noticing.
In the smaller virtual room, the estimated 2D translation ratios were
0.68 (lower) and 1.16 (upper).

Moreover, signiﬁcant differences were found in participants’ re-
sponses regarding their perceived walking speed between the two
size conditions. In reporting these results, Kim et al. [24] assumed
that they may be a result of differences in the location of the virtual
horizon, which are determined by room size based on a previous
study that perceived distance in the VR space was biased to be
larger when the location of horizon became lower [30]. However,
no quantitative data was presented to support the argument that rela-
tive transition gains depend on the height of the horizon in virtual
space. Therefore, our study aims to address the limitations of Kim et
al.’s [24] work by adopting a more structured approach in verifying
how the user’s visual perception in VEs affects threshold ranges for
relative translation gains.

3 METHOD
3.1 Research Questions and Hypotheses
The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of virtual room
size and objects on relative translation gain thresholds with more
quantitative data and provide recommendations on enlarging the
movable area of a virtual space. For this, we decided to use the
Angles of Declination (AoD) between the user’s eye-gaze and the
forward-gaze, as shown in Figure 2, to conﬁgure various spatial
conditions. The eye-gaze refers to the vector from the subject’s
eye position (Peye) to the subject’s eye-gazed point (Pgaze), and the
forward-gaze refers to the orthogonal projection vector of the eye-
gaze. The size of virtual rooms and the location of objects were
set according to different locations of virtual horizon formed by the
intersection between the room’s ﬂoor and the wall. We also aim
to observe how the users perceive the virtual space in each spatial
conﬁguration with a distribution of AoD in each condition. For these
goals, we set our research question as follows:

RQ1. How do virtual room size and object affect the threshold range

Figure 3: Top-view of the path in (A) Empty and (B) Furnished in
Medium size condition. Each number on the ﬂoor refers to a sequential

Zone 1, Z2 = Zone 2).

of relative translation gains?

RQ2. How do virtual room size and object affect the distribution of

AoDs?

To answer these questions, we set three room sizes (Large,
Medium, Small) and two layouts (Empty, Furnished) for our study
conditions. In doing so, we assumed that when the AoD distribution
get increases, the user will be more sensitive to changes in their
walking speed based on a previous study asserting that the user
becomes more sensitive to shortened distances in a VE where the
virtual horizon is farther away [52]. The Furnished condition was
set to shift the AoD distribution to the lower end compared with the
Empty condition. In accordance with the rationale behind the study
conditions, we derived our hypotheses as below:

H1-1. The probabilities of “larger” responses to all relative translation
gains will be lower in the Large condition than in the Medium
condition.

H1-2. The probabilities of “larger” responses to all relative translation
gains will be lower in the Large condition than in the Small
condition.

H1-3. The probabilities of “larger” responses to all relative translation
gains will be lower in the Medium condition than in the Small
condition.

H2-1. The probabilities of “larger” responses to all relative translation
gains will be lower in the Large × Empty condition than in the
Large × Furnished condition.

H2-2. The probabilities of “larger” responses to all relative translation
gains will be lower in the Medium × Empty condition than in
the Medium × Furnished condition.

H2-3. The probabilities of “larger” responses to all relative translation
gains will be lower in the Small × Empty condition than in the
Small × Furnished condition.

3.2 Study Design
We chose three paths out of ﬁve paths used in Kim et al. [24], con-
sidering the location of objects in the Furnished condition. Figure 3
shows the three paths we used for our study. Subjects repeatedly
performed the walking tasks in sequence from path 1 to path 3.

each size condition. Combined path and furniture are placed at the center of each condition.

Through path 1 and path 2, participants experienced the maximum
translation gain and minimum translation gain. On path 3, they expe-
rienced the square mean of the maximum and minimum translation
gain. Following relative translation gains conditions used for thresh-
old estimation in Kim et al. [24], we ﬁxed a reference translation
gain (gT,y) to 1.0. Another axis’s translation gain gT,x was set at
0.825, 0.875, or 0.925 to estimate the minimum 2D translation ratio,
and gT,x was set to 1.15, 1.2, or 1.25 to estimate the maximum 2D
translation ratio. These six relative translation gains were randomly
ordered and repeated seven times with the Latin-squared method for
within-counterbalancing.

As shown in Figure 2, the AoD (θAoD) between eye-gaze and the
forward-gaze can be measured from the position of the eye-gazed
point (Pgaze) and the position of the eye (Peye). We can compute
θAoD with the following formula:

θAoD = arctan(

)

where the position of

the eye is Peye =
(xgaxe, ygaze, zgaze) and the position of
(xeye, yeye, zeye). Pgaze and Peye were measured using HTC Vive
Pro Eye, SPanipal SDK, and TobiiXR plugin used in the experiment.
To determine the virtual room size, we assumed that a participant
whose eyes are 1.5 m above the ﬂoor surface (heye) is located at the
center of the virtual room. We then deployed a square-shaped virtual
conference room with walls located at the virtual horizon set for the
preconﬁgured AoD values. As shown in Table 1, we set the AoD to
be −10◦, −20◦, −30◦. In order to induce the following AoD setting,
lengths and widths of each VR room were set at 17 m, 8.2 m, 5.2 m.
We named each VR room’s size condition as Large (17 m × 17 m),
Medium (8.2 m × 8.2 m), and Small (5.2 m × 5.2 m).

In the Furnished condition, virtual objects were placed to shorten
the distance to the virtual horizon, thereby shifting the AoD dis-
tribution to the lower end compared with the Empty condition. In
order to do so, we chose a ﬁxed layout that could block the user’s
eye-gaze from reaching the wall with 5 clusters of virtual furniture
items commonly found in a conference room: two bookshelves, a
sofa, three boxes, a table with four chairs, and a TV with speakers.
To decide the location of each cluster of furniture, we divided them
into two groups. The ﬁrst group’s role was to block eye-gaze to

reach the virtual horizon made by the wall, and three sets of furniture
were placed as Figure 3(B). Two bookshelves were placed at the end
of path 1 to prevent user’s eye-gaze to reach to the wall while they
were walking in zone 1. Similarly, the sofa was located at the end of
path 2 and three boxes were placed at the end of path 3. The other
two clusters (A table cluster and a TV cluster) were deployed for
more realistic conference room construction. We named the virtual
room with furniture as the Furnished condition and the empty room
as Empty condition.

By combining three room sizes (Large, Medium, Small) with
two object layouts (Empty, Furnished), we generated six experi-
mental conditions to estimate relative translation gain thresholds, as
illustrated in Figure 4. To identify the effect of relative translation
gains on VR sickness, we added two additional conditions without
applying relative translation gains to the study. The VR sickness will
increase when users wear VR HMD for a long time, so if the RDW
technique affects the increase of VR sickness, this RDW is hard to
apply for the actual scenario. In order to see the effect of relative
translation gains on VR sickness, we compared post-Simulator Sick-
ness Questionnaire (SSQ) [22] scores with 42 trials without relative
translation gains and 42 trials with relative translation gains applied.
As Kim et al. [24] found that the post-SSQ were higher in a larger
virtual space, we chose the Large condition to observe the effect of
relative translation gains on VR sickness. We could ﬁnalize a total
of eight conditions: Small × Empty, Medium × Empty, Large ×
Empty, Large × Empty (No Gains), Small × Furnished, Medium ×
Furnished, Large × Furnished, Large × Furnished (No Gains).

The study was set up in an empty 6 m × 6 m physical indoor space
with four HTC VIVE base stations (v2.0) installed at the top corners.
We used Unity 3D (v2019.3.7f1) and steam VR Plugin (v1.16.10)
to implement a virtual conference room environment. Each room
was established based on the same conference room prefab, and
the combined paths and furniture were located at the center of each
room. We employed SRanipal SDK and TobiiXR Plugin to obtain
each participant’s eye-tracking data. We measured the AoD through
Equation 2 approximately 36 θAoD samples per second. From the
accumulated AoD values, we extracted ones obtained when users
made a change in their paths and when they were standing at a ﬁxed
position in the Start Zone to answer questionnaires.

3.3 Participants

The participants were recruited through the local university website
and paid $ 20 in remuneration. Of the 32 participants, 20 identiﬁed
as male and 12 as female. All participants were at least 18 years
old and all had normal vision or corrected to normal vision. The
mean age of the participants was 23.81 (SD = 3.86), and the mean
interpupillary distance (IPD) of them was 64.17 (SD = 1.89). Most
of them had a moderate level of experience in HMD-mediated VR
environments: 24 participants had worn VR HMDs up to ten times
before and four for more. Only four of them had no prior experience.
To reduce the learning effect and fatigue from using VR HMDs, we
separated participants into two groups and opted for a mixed-subject
method with the existence of virtual objects as the between-subject
variable and the size of the VR room as the within-subject variable.
As we assume the AoD may affect the threshold range, we balanced
the average height between the two groups, as given in Table 2. In
addition, we also maintained the gender ratio among the groups, as
it also might affect the outcome [48].

3.4 Study Procedure

The content and procedures of this study were approved by an Insti-
tutional Review Board. The ﬁrst group of participants experienced
four Empty conditions, and the other group experienced four Fur-
nished conditions. Figure 6 show the participant’s view through the
VR HMD during the experiment. Figure 6(A) is participant’s view
in Large × Empty condition where the ﬁrst group of participants
experienced and Figure 6(B) show the participant’s view of Large
× Furnished condition that the second group of participants experi-
enced. They walked along the three given paths in sequential order
while experiencing changes to their perceived speed between the
maximum and minimum translation gain values. After they walked
along three paths, they were asked to answer whether they felt their
movements in the virtual environment were “larger” or “smaller”
than in the real environment. We used a pseudo-Two-Alternative
Forced-Choice (pseudo-2AFC) which is widely used for estimating
redirected walking threshold range [18, 44, 48]. After they answered

this questionnaire and pressed the “next” button, they went to the
Start Zone and repeated 42 trials (six relative translation gains ×
seven repetitions). The order of the four conditions conducted in
each participant group was randomized and counterbalanced.

In the study sessions, participants ﬁrst wore an HTC VIVE Pro
Eye with a wireless HTC Vive Pro adapter attached to their heads
and held an HTC VIVE Pro controller in their hands to completed
an eye-tracking calibration session. They then conducted test trials
before the main study trials, which included walking along the
path and answering the pseudo-2AFC questionnaire. After the test
trial, they took off the VR HMD and ﬁlled out the pre-SSQ. Next,
they conducted the main study trials. They were permitted to take
breaks whenever they wanted and were required to answer the post-
SSQ after each condition was completed. After they ﬁnished every
condition, they were subject to a short semi-structured interview
on how the VR room’s conﬁguration affected their response to the
questionnaire. Each group of participants experienced 168 trials (42
trials × four experimental conditions) and took approximately 15
minutes for each experimental conditions. The total duration of each
study session was approximately two hours.

4.1 Statistic Result

We investigated how the size of a virtual space (Size) and the place-
ment of objects in it (Object) affect the user’s relative translation
gain thresholds (Gain) by comparing the probabilities of “larger”
responses. The Aligned Rank Transform (ART) for non-parametric
factorial ANOVA analysis (α = 0.05), proposed by Wobbrock et
al. [49], was applied to conduct a multivariate analysis for the within-
subject factor of Size (Large, Medium, Small), the between-subject
factor of Object (Empty and Furnished), and the factor of Gain
(Gain 1 Gain 6). All pairwise comparisons during the post-hoc
analysis were Bonferroni corrected. The six relative translation gain
factors represent the following pairs of x-axis and y-axis translation
gain values: Gain 1 = (0.825, 1), Gain 2 = (0.875, 1), Gain 3 =

(1.25, 1). We excluded two participants’ data as outliers, one in the
Empty condition on account of system malfunction and one in the
Furnished condition due to participant error.

We found signiﬁcant main effects of Size (F(2, 490) = 16.690,
p < .001), Object (F(1, 490) = 60.984, p < .001), and Gain
(F(5, 490) = 140.894, p < .001). The pairwise comparison revealed
signiﬁcant differences between pairs of Size conditions: Large and
Medium (p < .001), and Large and Small (p < .001). A signiﬁcant
difference between the Medium and Small condition (p > .05) was
not found. In the post-hoc analysis, four pairs of Gain levels showed
no signiﬁcant differences (Gain 1-Gain 2: p = .109; Gain 2-Gain
3: p = .977; Gain 4-Gain 5: p = .255; and Gain 5-Gain 6: p =
.517). On the other hand, all other pairs showed signiﬁcant differ-
ences (all p < .001). Conclusively, we found that the mean value
for the probability of “larger” responses was signiﬁcantly lower in
the Large room than both the Medium and Small room for all six
relative translation gains, as shown in Figure 5. Furthermore, the
mean probability value for the Furnished room was also signiﬁcantly
lower than for the Empty room across all gains.

4.2 Threshold Estimation

The results of ﬁtted psychometric functions of mean estimated thresh-
old values in six virtual room conditions are given in Figure 7. The
mean estimated threshold values of participants and Standard Error
of the Mean (SEM) are also presented in Figure 7. The graph’s
x-axis shows the translation gain for the x-axis (gT,x) in the VR
room where the reference translation gain (gT,y) is ﬁxed at 1.0. The
graph’s y-axis shows the probabilities of participants’ responses
to the question, “Was the virtual movement larger or smaller than
the physical movement?” We used a standard logistic psychometric
function to ﬁt the data as follows:

f (x) =

1
1 + eax+b

(3)

The Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) of each condition was
obtained from the ﬁtted psychometric functions. To detect thresh-
old value (2D translation ratio, αT ), we applied the 25% and 75%
criterion used by Steinicke et al. [44]. Table 3 shows the estimated

relative translation gain thresholds of each condition. αT,lower refers
to the lower boundary of a threshold range (minimum 2D translation
ratio), and αT,upper refers to the upper boundary of a threshold range
(maximum 2D translation ratio), which indicate that the participant’s
perceived speed of one axis in a VE can be slower or faster between
αT,lower and αT,upper without the user noticing the differences. Esti-
mated threshold values increased according to the size increases in
Empty conditions. Moreover, these threshold values were higher in
the Furnished condition than in the Empty condition for the same
room size.

4.3 AoD Distribution
Figure 8(A) shows the distribution of AoD according to each VR
room size condition. The x-axis of the graph is the AoD (θAoD)
between the user’s eye-gaze and the forward-gaze. θAoD = 0◦ means
a participant is gazing straight forward when they are walking. When

reversely, θAoD increases to a positive degree when they gaze upward.
The y-axis of the graph shows the density of normalized AoD for
each participant. The AoD degree with high density means many
participants gaze to that particular AoD. We measured participant’s
AoD from the position of the foveal area, but humans typically
recognize about 10 degrees downward from the location of the
foveal area while they are walking [19]. In the case of Large ×
Empty, the average AoD was set to −10◦ so that the user could
notice the virtual horizon in areas ranging from 0◦ to −10◦, Medium
× Empty from −10◦ to −20◦, and Small × Empty from −20◦ to
−30◦.

Based on this, we highlighted the AoD area where users could
perceive the room’s virtual horizon with the corresponding color
in each graph. The blue areas in Figure 8(A1),(B1) refers to the
virtual horizon-noticeable area of Large × Empty, the purple areas in
Figure 8(A2),(B2) to those of Medium × Empty, and the red areas in
Figure 8(A3),(B3) to those of Small × Empty. Figure 8(A1) shows
that in the Large condition, the presence of virtual objects biases the
distribution of AoD to be lower: the Furnished condition’s peak in
the highlighted area was higher than those of Empty condition, but
the peak near zero was also higher than that of Empty one, as shown
in Figure 8(A2). In the Small condition, the peak of highlighted area
in the Furnished condition is higher than in the Empty condition, as
shown through Figure 8(A3).

4.4 Post VR Sickness Comparison

A paired-sample t-test was conducted to compare the mean post-
SSQ Total Score (TS) by the participants after conducting the Large
× Empty (with gains) condition and the Large × Empty (no gain)
condition. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the mean post-SSQ
TS scores for Large × Empty (with gains) (M = 27.58, SD = 24.87)
and Large × Empty (no gain) (M = 24.27, SD = 23.95) conditions;
t = 1.20, p = 0.249. A paired-sample t-test was also conducted
to compare the mean post-SSQ TS score by the participants after
conducting the Large × Furnished (with gains) condition and the
Large × Furnished (no gain) condition. There was no signiﬁcant
difference in the mean post-SSQ TS scores for Large × Furnished
(with gains) (M = 29.16, SD = 14.50) and Large × Empty (no gain)
(M = 28.81, SD = 21.05) conditions; t = 0.076, p = 0.940. We
thereby conﬁrm that relative translation gains are not a signiﬁcant
factor for increases in VR simulator sickness.

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 Analysis

We verify the six hypotheses based on our statistical analysis and
AoD distribution graphs. Our results conﬁrmed the ﬁrst hypothesis
(H1-1): The probabilities of “larger” responses at all relative trans-
lation gains in the Large condition were signiﬁcantly lower than
in the Medium condition. Our results also supported the second
hypothesis (H1-2), as the probabilities of “larger” responses at all
relative translation gains in the Large condition were signiﬁcantly
lower than in the Small condition. These results indicate that par-
ticipants were less sensitive to the increase in their walking speed
in the Large room than in the Medium and Small rooms. Thus, our
results align with Kim et al.’s [24] in that the relative translation gain
thresholds increased to a greater degree when the virtual room size
became larger. Considering that the shape of virtual spaces used
in Kim et al.’s [24] study and ours differed, the former rectangular
and the latter square-shaped, we assert that the size of a VE is more
relevant in determining the threshold range rather than the shape of
the room or walking distance.

Furthermore, we were able to verify that the location of the virtual
horizon affects the threshold range in Empty conditions by recording
the user’s AoD distribution, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8(A1)-
(A3) shows that in each Empty condition, users lay their gaze most

frequently in the highlighted area, which indicates that they were
aware of the virtual horizon while they were walking. Although
the AoDs in three room size conditions were set incrementally, a
linear relationship between the average AoD and estimated threshold
values was not found. We assume that this is because the degrees of
AoD within which user take notice of the virtual horizon continu-
ously change while they are walking, and their height also affects
the AoD distribution. As AoD values were affected by the height
of participant’s eye-gaze and the location of the virtual horizon, this
implies that not only the size of a virtual room but also the height of
the user should be considered as factors in determining the threshold
range of relative translation gains.

On the other hand, the probabilities of “larger” responses at all
relative translation gains in the Medium room were not signiﬁcantly
lower than in the Small condition, thus rejecting our third hypothesis
(H1-3). We posit that this may be on account of the fact that the size
difference between the Medium (8.2 m × 8.2 m) and Small (5.2 m
× 5.2 m) condition was relatively smaller than the size differences
between the Large (17 m × 17 m) and Medium (8.2 m × 8.2 m) or
Large (17 m × 17 m) and Small (5.2 m × 5.2 m) condition. That
the AoD distribution of Medium × Empty (purple line) and Small
× Empty (red line) were similar as shown in Figure 8(A2),(A3)
supports this assumption.

Our results further lead us to reject H2-1, H2-2, and H2-3, in
which we postulated that the presence of virtual objects would lower
the location to the virtual horizon, thereby decreasing both the AoD
and the threshold range: Figure 5 shows the probabilities of “larger”
responses at all relative translation gains in the Furnished condition
were signiﬁcantly lower than in the Empty condition. This indicates
that users were less sensitive to the change in their walking speed
when objects were placed in the virtual space. Figure 8(A1) shows
that the presence of furniture led to a shift in the AoD distribution
for the Large rooms, meaning that the virtual horizon was perceived
to be lower. Although we assumed that this would raise the level of
user awareness regarding adjustments made to relative translation
gains, statistical results were to the contrary.

Based on previous studies suggesting that visual cognitive load
and attention inﬂuence the sense of vection in VEs [40, 46], we
assert that this is because across the three furnished conditions, vir-
tual objects were more dominantly perceived as distractions that
drove the user’s attention away from changes in their walking speed
than as blockages placed to shorten the distance to the horizon and
thereby reduce the perceived size of the virtual space. More recently,
Williams et al. [48] showed that the rotational gain threshold in-
creased when a distractor was present in the VE. We were also able
to identify evidence from semi-structured interviews with the par-
ticipants, in which they stated that the furniture in the virtual rooms
had caught their attention. Some stated that in estimating their own
speed, they relied on the speed at which the furniture moved towards
them as they were walking as a point of reference. When asked how
the overall experience during the task was, some commented that
they kept thinking of the furniture around them, and one of them
even “walked imagining what would be behind the furniture.”

This line of reasoning can also explain why the furnished condi-
tion was less effective in shifting the AoD distribution in the Medium
and Small rooms towards the lower end than the Large room, as
shown in Figure 8(A2),(A3): As the AoD value in perceiving the
virtual horizon was already small in these size conditions compared
to the Large room, objects in the room had a greater effect in dis-
tracting the users from the change in their walking speed and caused
them to gaze upward more frequently. Table 3 illustrates that the
estimated threshold value αT , upper in the Furnished conditions
were more than 0.1 larger than those of the Empty conditions. This
indicates that compared to the user’s walking speed in the Empty
conditions, that in the Furnished conditions could be increased as
much as 10% without them noticing the differences.

5.2 Implications

Relative translation gains allow users to move around in a more
expansive virtual space than the real space they are in, all the while
maintaining the alignment between the real and virtual space and
thereby creating a more stable environment for spatial deformation.
Our study shows that in the context of utilizing relative translation
gains for these purposes, the effect of expanding or transforming the
space can increase when the threshold range is shifted to a larger
degree. Therefore, we propose two design considerations to enhance
the effect of relative translation gains in expanding the size of the
adjusted movable space in VEs.

First, the perceived movable space should be made larger than the
adjusted movable space to obtain a wider range of relative translation
gain thresholds in constructing virtual scenes. However, users may
collide with the physical boundaries of the real space they are in
when they attempt to walk towards the perceived movable space
with this approach. Therefore, VR safety systems such as grid vi-
sualization, which is widely used for VR HMD-based playground
setups1, should be implemented in tandem. When a VR HMD
application requires securing a broad walkable virtual space, devel-
opers may consider constructing the virtual space with expanded
perceived movable space and limiting users’ actual movable area
through virtual object placement or other stimuli.

Second, placing objects in the virtual scene can further increase
the range of relative translation gain thresholds and the size of the
movable space, subsequently. Those who experienced the Furnished
condition stated that while they used the speed at which the furniture
in the space approached them to estimate their own speed, they were
less sensitive to an increase in speed compared to the Empty condi-
tion. Based on these responses and the estimated threshold ranges in
each condition, we conclude that even when the size of the perceived
movable space remains the same, objects function as distractors
and change the user’s perception of their own walking speed in VE.
Therefore, the developers should made informed choices regarding
the RDW threshold depending on the existence of virtual objects in
the virtual scene.

The implications derived from our study’s ﬁndings can contribute
to the generation of realistic and effective mutual spaces through
RDW based on relative translation gains for MR remote collabora-
tion. For example, organizing a mutual space in a large, furnished
conference hall where the perceived movable space can be consider-
ably larger than the adjusted movable space will be more beneﬁcial
than setting up an empty, nondescript virtual space conﬁgured by
walls that limit the perceived movable space to match the adjusted
movable space. As prior works have found that virtual objects are
regarded as obstacles or distractors along with real ones in an AR
scene as well [42, 43], leveraging the use of virtual objects in asym-
metric collaboration will result in a mutual MR space more suitable
for both the VR and AR side than other mutual space generation
methods with empty spaces as the default setting [28].

5.3 Limitations

Our study conﬁrms that the threshold range for relative translation
gains is affected by how users visually perceive a virtual space.
However, there are some limitations to our approach. First, the effect
of objects as distractors on the threshold range should be veriﬁed in
detail, as a systematic, quantitative data-based analysis on the degree
to which the objects attracted the user’s attention was not given in
our study. Although our study focused on the effects of the presence
or absence of objects in virtual room, further studies on various
conﬁguration of virtual spaces through the placement of objects are
needed. In addition, the effects of dynamic objects such as avatars
or interactive objects should be also be further investigated.

Second, our study was conducted with users placed solely in a
single space, which presents limits in applying its implications to
multi-user scenarios in multiple heterogeneous spaces. When more
than one user is simultaneously involved in RDW in a co-located
mutual space, each with different relative translation gains applied
according to the spatial conﬁgurations of their physical space, the
presence of other users and their actions may alter the effect of
space size and the existence of objects, as a previous study afﬁrmed
that the visual style and locomotion speed of another user’s avatar
inﬂuences the remote user’s perception [13].

Lastly, the effects of individual differences [24, 48] on the cog-
nitive threshold of relative translation gains should be explored.
Although we set the gender ratio between the two groups to be the
same and adjusted the average height between conditions to min-
imize the impact of these individual differences on the threshold
range, further research considering these differences is needed to
estimate personalized threshold ranges. By considering the effects
of spatial conﬁgurations and personal traits together, the accuracy of
relative translation gains and their threshold ranges can be further
enhanced in generating a uniﬁed mutual space.

6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this study, we examined the effects of virtual room size and the
presence of objects on the threshold range of relative translation
gains in six spatial conditions, which were conﬁgured according to
disparate Angles of Declination (AoDs) between the user’s eye-gaze
and forward-gaze. Relative translation gain thresholds are biased
to be higher in large virtual rooms, as the actual AoD distribution
shifts towards the higher end as the size of the room increases. The
presence of virtual objects also increased the threshold range of
relative translation gains, despite the fact that they had no apparent
effect on shifting the AoD distribution. In the furnished rooms,
objects functioned more as distractors that contributed to a relative
insensitivity to the change in their walking speed, inducing users to
become less sensitive be faster in the VE.

When creating a mutual space while maintaining the alignment of
the real space and the virtual space, relative translation gains could
be used as a technique to adjust the space of a VR user to the desired
shape beyond existing methods that identify common areas from
heterogeneous spaces [23, 28]. Based on our ﬁndings, we conclude
that constructing a virtual space where the perceived movable space
is larger than the adjusted movable space, as well as placing objects
in the space, can increase the space-deforming effect of relative
translation gains. Applied in this way, relative translation gains
can be used for adjusting heterogeneous virtual spaces to generate
realistic MR mutual spaces that consider the conﬁgurations of both
the physical and virtual space.

Our future study will investigate how varied conditions involv-
ing virtual objects inﬂuence users’ attention during RDW, ﬁrst by
controlling the number of objects in a virtual scene. Furthermore,
we will explore how the layout of virtual spaces conﬁgured by the
placement of objects affects relative translation gain thresholds, as it
was ﬁxed to a single conﬁguration in our current study. We will also
analyze the effect of each type of distractor with quantitative data
on the amount of time each distractor was gazed at. Finally, we will
expand our study to various multi-user remote MR collaboration
scenarios to verify the beneﬁts of relative translation gains in such
environments and how they inﬂuence user experiences.
