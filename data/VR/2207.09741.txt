ABSTRACT

In the optical spectra of the cold post-AGB supergiant GSC 04050−02366, obtained with the 6-meter BTA telescope with
a spectral resolution of R≥60 000 on arbitrary dates over 2019÷2021, a radial velocity variability is found. Heliocentric
Vr based on the positional measurements of numerous absorptions varies from date to date with a standard deviation
of ∆Vr≈1.4 km/s about the average value of Vr=24.75 km/s, which may stem out of the low-amplitude pulsations in
the atmosphere. The spectra of the star are purely absorption type, there are no obvious emissions. Intensity variability
of most of absorptions and Swan bands of the C2 molecule was discovered. A slight asymmetry of the Hα proﬁle is
observed at some observation dates. The position of Hα absorption core varies within 27.3÷30.6 km/s. Splitting into
two components (or asymmetry) of strong low-excitation absorptions (YII, ZrII, BaII, LaII, CeII, NdII) was found.
The position of the long-wavelength component coincides with the position of other photospheric absorptions, which
conﬁrms its formation in the atmosphere of the star. The position of the shortwave component is close to the position
of the rotational features of Swan bands, which indicates its formation in the circumstellar envelope expanding at a
velocity of about Vexp=16 km/s.

1. Introduction

In recent decades, a detailed spectroscopy of by far evolved stars that have passed evolutionary stages with nucleosynthesis
in the stellar cores and episodes with mass loss due to the stellar wind and ejection of the envelope is carried out at the
6-meter BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory RAS. Numerous results obtained within the framework
of the program are brieﬂy presented in the survey Klochkova et al. (2022). One of the main areas of our research is
spectroscopy of massive hypergiants with initial masses of 20−40 M⊙ near the luminosity limit on the Hertzsprung–
Russell diagram. Results of spectral monitoring at the BTA of these extremely rare objects are summarized in a recent
survey Klochkova (2019a). Less massive evolved far stars with initial masses of around 2−8 M⊙ are observed on the
asymptotic giant branch (hereinafter, AGB) in the form of red supergiants with an eﬀective temperature of Teﬀ ≈3000–
4500 K. By far evolved AGB stars at the stages of hydrogen and helium layer burning experience a signiﬁcant mass loss
due to the forceful (the rate in the interval of 10−8 ÷ 10−4M⊙/year) stellar wind (H¨ofner and Olofsson 2018). Owing to
the wind, an expanding envelope of gas and dust is formed around the star, the presence of which manifests itself in
the excess IR ﬂux, speciﬁc features in the radio, IR and optical spectra. Circumstellar gas and dust envelopes formed
at the RGB, AGB, and post-AGB stages of evolution appear in large excesses of IR radiation, which serves as the main
selection criterion for these objects (Kwok 1993).

Interest in AGB stars and their nearest descendants—post-AGB stars in particular stems from the fact that it is
in these stars, being in the short-term evolutionary stage, that physical conditions arise for the synthesis of nuclei of
heavy metals and their subsequent dredge-up into the stellar atmosphere. Owing to these processes AGB stars are the
main suppliers (over 50%) of all elements heavier than iron, synthesized as a result of the s-process, the essence of which
consists in a slow (compared to β-decay) neutronization of nuclei. The main features of stellar evolution near the AGB
and the results of up-to-date calculations of synthesis and dredge-up of elements are given in the papers by Bloecker
(1995); Herwig (2005); Di Criscienzo et al. (2016); Liu et al. (2018).

A part of AGB and post-AGB supergiants is accessible to optical spectroscopy with high spectral resolution. We
have published the surveys of these studies performed on the 6-meter telescope in the papers Klochkova (1997, 2014,
2019b). This program of observations also includes a cool supergiant GSC 04050−02366, associated with an IR source
IRAS Z02229+6208 (hereinafter IRAS Z02229). This star of spectral type G8–K0 Ia (Hrivnak and Kwok 1999) is faint in
the visible range due to a signiﬁcant interstellar and circumstellar extinction, hence it has a short and uncomprehensive
history of study.

The data of the InfraRed Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) indicated the presence of a powerful ﬂux at the 25 µm
band from the IRAS Z02229 source. This has stimulated the beginning of an active study of the object. 1999 turned
out to be especially fruitful in the study of the IRAS Z02229 system. Hrivnak and Kwok (1999), using low-resolution

optical spectra revealed the presence of absorption bands of the C2 and C3 molecules and assigned the object to a scanty
group of protoplanetary nebulae (PPN) with an emission at the wavelength of λ=21 µm. The same (Hrivnak and Kwok
1999) authors summarized the information about the IRAS Z02229 system, published by the time of their study: a
two-humped shape of SED, a color excess E(B − V ) = 1.0, a considerable expansion of the circumstellar envelope,
including its expanse in Hα; an intense envelope emission in the (3; 2) band of the CO molecule, which made it possible
to determine the systemic velocity of this object Vsys=+24.3 km/s and the envelope expansion rate Vexp=+15.2 km/s.
The main data required for our work, published on the star GSC 04050−02366, associated with the IR source IRAS Z02229,
are listed in Table 1. With such a high color excess, the object, the predecessor of GSC 04050−02366 at the previous AGB
stage, refers to the so-called ERO C-rich stars, according to the classiﬁcation of stars with mighty envelopes (Extremely
Red Objects) introduced by Groenewegen (2022). It is important to note here a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the eﬀective
temperature and color excess values for this star, determined by various methods: the method of atmospheric models in
Reddy et al. (1999) and Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) modeling using the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes (Kamath et al.
2022). The next important step of GSC 04050−02366 research was the widely cited work of Reddy et al. Reddy et al.

(1999). These authors, based on a high-resolution optical spectrum, obtained with the 2.7-m telescope echelle spectrograph
of the McDonald observatory, determined the parameters of the stellar atmosphere model and its detailed chemical
composition. As a result, Reddy et al. (1999) came to a conclusion that metallicity of the stellar atmosphere is reduced:
[Fe/H]⊙ = −0.5 at large excesses of carbon [C/Fe]⊙ = +0.8 and heavy metals of the s-process [s/Fe]⊙ = +1.4. Such
peculiarities of the chemical composition indicate that the star has passed the evolutionary AGB stage and the 3-d
dredge-up episode.

So far, there has been no further of the optical spectroscopy of GSC 04050−02366, which prompted us to start
spectral monitoring of the star with high spectral resolution. In this paper we present the results of the analysis of
several optical spectra of GSC 04050−02366, obtained with the 6-m BTA telescope on arbitrary dates over 2019÷2021.
The primary purpose of our work is to search for the possible variability of the spectral feature proﬁles and studying the
temporal behavior of the Vr pattern. Section 2 of the paper brieﬂy describes techniques of observation and data analysis.
Section 3 shows our results in comparison with those published earlier, in Section 4 we present a discussion of the results
obtained, while the main conclusions are listed in Section 5.

The spectra of GSC 04050−02366 were obtained with the NES echelle spectrograph (Panchuk et al. 2017), stationary
located at the Nasmyth focus of the 6-meter BTA telescope. The moments of observation of the star are listed in Table 2.

this fragment, including the edge of the C2 molecule band head at the wavelength near λ 5635 ˚A.

At present, the NES spectrograph is ﬁtted up with a large-format CCD with 4608×2048 elements sized 0.0135×0.0135 mm,
readout noise 1.8 e−. The registered spectral range in our spectra is ∆λ = 470 − 778 nm. To reduce ﬂux losses not falling
of spectral resolution, the NES spectrograph is equipped with an image slicer with a conﬁguration for 3 slices. Spectral
resolution is λ/∆λ ≥60 000, the ratio of signal to the level of noise along the echelle order in the spectra varies from 40
to 70. Moreover, the signal is signiﬁcantly reduced in the short-wavelength part of the echelle frame due to a signiﬁcant
absorption of stellar radiation in the circumstellar medium.

3. Spectral features and radial velocity behaviour

To identify the features in the spectra of GSC 04050−02366 we used the spectral atlas (Klochkova et al. 2007a,b) based on
detailed spectroscopy of a related post-AGB star HD 56126 (IRAS 07134+1005), as well as the spectral atlas (Barnbaum
1994) for carbon stars.

3.1. Radial velocity

All results of heliocentric velocity Vr measurements are given in columns (2)–(5) of Table 2. The average Vr values for
symmetrical absorptions, rotational components of Swan bands and interstellar features of the DIBs are given for the
samples of details and the errors of these means.

From the comparison of high-accuracy data in the second column of the Table, we obtain the radial velocity
variability: the average Vr value over the measurements of positions of many metal absorptions varies from date to
date around the mean value Vr=24.75 km/s with the standard deviation from the mean ∆Vr=1.4 km/s, which may be a
consequence of low-amplitude pulsations in the atmosphere.

3.2. Swan bands

As shown in Hrivnak and Kwok (1999); Reddy et al. (1999), one of the most noticeable features of the optical spectrum
of this star are the bands of carbon-containing CN, C2 and C3 molecules. All our spectra also contain the Swan bands
of the C2 molecule. Moreover, in the spectra we recorded over 2019−2021, all Swan bands are present as absorptions.
For illustration, Fig. 1 shows a fragment of the spectrum, including the Swan band molecules C2 (0; 1) with the head
on λ=5635 ˚A for four moments of observations. The variation in the intensity of the band cannot be explained by the
diﬀerence in the observation conditions, since the spectra of 2019–2020 are obtained on the observation nights with
excellent transparency and seeing β = 1′′ ÷ 1′′.5. Only at one night of 23.10.2021 the seeing was slightly worse: β ≈ 3′′.

Radial velocity, km/s

Fig. 2. Hα proﬁle in the “radial velocity–relative intensity” coordinates in the spectra of GSC 04050−−02366 obtained on diﬀerent
dates (the colors of the lines as in Fig. 1). Here and further the position of the dashed vertical line coincides with the value of the
systemic velocity Vsys=+24.3 km/s according to Hrivnak and Kwok (1999).

The variability of the band’s intensity in this ﬁgure can be explained by non-sphericity of the envelope, which
causes diﬀerent extents of its contribution to the observed spectrum. This assumption is consistent with the “elongated”
morphology type for the image of IRAS Z02229 obtained with the HST (Sahai et al. 2007). Nonsphericity of the dust
envelope in the IRAS Z02229 system is also conﬁrmed by a high level of polarization (Ueta et al. 2005, 2007; Akras et al.
2017). The inﬂuence of a powerful envelope on the observed spectrum of the star as a whole is manifested in such a way.

3.3. Hα proﬁle

The spectra of GSC 04050−02366 do not contain explicit emission features or wind components typical of early post-AGB
stars. As seen in Fig. 2, the Hα proﬁle in the GSC 04050−02366 spectra is almost symmetrical, only at some dates there
is a slight asymmetry of the proﬁle in the form of an elevation of its short-wave wing. Moreover, this is observed only for
those two observation time instants for which the Swan band is signiﬁcantly weakened in Fig. 1. As follows from the data
in the third column of the Table 2, the position of the Hα absorption core varies within 27.3−30.6 km/s. For most of
the dates, the core is redshifted by about 2 km/s. This diﬀerence, according to the data of Reddy et al. (1999), is many
times higher in the 1996 spectrum.

In the spectra of the cool supergiant with a slight metallicity deﬁcit ([Fe/H]=−0.5 (Reddy et al. 1999)) the
absorptions of rotational transitions in the Swan system bands are mostly blended. However, the high spectral resolution
of our data allows to single out selected features of the rotational transitions of the Swan bands, focusing on their
proﬁles, which are more narrow compared to the photospheric absorptions. The average values of the measured velocities
Vr(Swan), their errors and the number of used features are given in the fourth column of the Table 2.

3.4. Split absorptions

Reddy et al. (1999) noted that intensity of the BaII ion lines in the GSC 04050−02366 spectrum is too high, which makes
it diﬃcult to model them and calculate the barium abundance in the atmosphere of the star. Figure 3 demonstrates
the BaII 6141 line proﬁle in our spectrum for 06.12.2019. Here you can clearly see the complex structure of the proﬁle
of this line, split into two components. The “1” component is marked in this ﬁgure, the position of which is consistent
with the position of other photospheric absorptions, which indicates its formation in the atmosphere of the star. The
shortwave component “2” is an envelope component, since its position corresponds to the velocity of Vr≈9.0 km/s close
to the Vr calculated from the positions of rotational features of Swan bands. The same ﬁgure additionally shows the
proﬁles of strong absorptions LaII 6390 and YII 5200 split into similar components. As you can see in Fig. 3, the width

of the shortwave component of each line is signiﬁcantly lower than the one of the long-wavelength one, which conﬁrms
formation of the short-wavelength component in the envelope.

In the spectra of GSC 04050−02366, the strongest absorptions of metals or ions (KI, NaI, YII, ZrII, BaII, LaII,
CeII, NdII) with a lower energy level low excitation potential (χlow ≤ 1 eV) are split into two components or have
asymmetrical proﬁles. In the presence of an explicit splitting, the position of their long-wavelength component coincides
with the position of unsplit absorptions of other metals, which conﬁrms its formation in the atmosphere of the star.
Position of the shortwave component is close to the position of Swan bands features, which reﬂects its formation in the

circumstellar environment. This splitting eﬀect obviously increases the equivalent width of the corresponding absorptions
and given a reduced spectral resolution it has to be taken into account in determining the abundance of heavy metals.

Figure 4 compares the proﬁles of the split BaII 6141 and LaII 6390 proﬁles in the spectra over four dates of our

observations. In general, the character of splitting is the same for all observation dates.

3.5. Interstellar features

In the spectrum of a distant star near the Galactic plane we naturally expect to ﬁnd the presence of a set of interstellar
features, which is rather well illustrated by the proﬁles of the NaI 5895 (thick line) and KI 7699 lines in Fig. 5. Here,
the component “1” (Vr≈ 30 km/s) is formed in the stellar atmosphere, the component “2” (Vr≈ 7.4 km/s)—in the
circumstellar envelope, where the Swan bands are also formed. Only the “6” and “7” components are reliably identiﬁed
in the NaI 5895 line proﬁle. The component Vr=−7.5 km/s is present in the KI 7699 line proﬁle, its interstellar origin
is conﬁrmed by the agreement of this velocity with the velocities in the last column of Table 2 by the identiﬁed DIBs.
The velocity range from Vr=−2.0 km/s to Vr=−22.0 km/s, which contains the “3–5” components of the NaI proﬁle, is a
set of interstellar absorptions, not resolvable at the spectral resolution of the NES spectrograph. It should also be taken
into account that during long exposures of a faint star, a NaI emission of telluric origin may be registered, the position
of which in the heliocentric system of velocities varies from date to date of observations.

Let us mention that the close interstellar components (Vr=−8.5, −44.4, −65.3 km/s) of the NaI 5889 and 5895 lines
proﬁle have been identiﬁed earlier in the spectra of the central star of the IRAS 02441+6922 (Klochkova et al. 2017),
whose galactic coordinates l/b = 132◦.9/9◦.2 diﬀer little from the coordinates of IRAS Z02229. In the spectrum of this
object, the DIB sample positions were reliably measured: their position corresponds to the velocity of Vr=−9.3±0.3 km/s.
Interstellar components of the NaI doublet with close velocities were registered by Miroshnichenko et al. (2021) and in the
spectrum of a distant hot star VES 723, whose galactic coordinates are also close to the coordinates of GSC 04050−02366:
l/b = 132◦.4/1◦.1.

It is diﬃcult to identify the diﬀuse bands of DIBs in the spectra of the cool star with a rich absorption spectrum
combined with molecular bands. In addition to the strongest DIBs at λ 5780 ˚A and λ 6284 ˚A, we managed to identify
only a few DIBs whose average position, Vr≈ −6.7 km/s, agrees with the position of the interstellar component KI.

To conclude this Section, let us note that Reyniers et al. (2002) showed that the absorption at λ ≈ 6707.8 ˚A should
be identiﬁed with CeII λ 6708.099 ˚A. For example, the authors of Reddy et al. (1999); Klochkova et al. (2008) identiﬁed
this absorption in the spectra of post-AGB stars with the LiI λ 6707.76 ˚A line and concluded that there is an excess of
lithium in the atmospheres of these stars. Reddy et al. (1999) noted unreliability of ﬁnding the lithium abundance in
the atmosphere of GSC 04050−02366 based on absorption intensity near λ 6707 ˚A due to the possible blending by the
CN and Ce lines. We have reliably identiﬁed this absorption with the CeII λ 6708.099 ˚A line, since the radial velocity
measurements based on the position of this feature are in excellent agreement with the mean Vr from the metal lines.

4. Discussion of the results

All the GSC 04050−02366 spectra we have are purely absorption spectra. At the same time, we have revealed the
variability of the spectrum and the peculiarities of the behavior of a number of absorptions. Photometric observations of
this star also indicate a signiﬁcant variability. According to the observations of GSC 04050−02366 in 2014−2018 from the
ASAS-SN survey of (Kochanek et al. 2017), the apparent brightness of the star varies in the range of 11m. 6–12m. 2. Based
on the analysis of these long observations, the period P=443d.04 and variability amplitude ∆V = 0m. 47 estimates are
made in the ASAS-SN database. Somewhat earlier, the photometric features of GSC 04050−02366 among the sample of
related post-AGB stars were studied by Hrivnak et al. (2010). These authors revealed a long-term brightness variability,
the presence of several periods with a dominant one of around 153 days, as well as a combination of deep minima (up to
∆V ≈ 0m. 54) with ﬂatter ones. The set of photometric data for IRAS Z02229 and related objects allowed these authors
to make a choice in favor of pulsations, and not binarity, as the cause of variability.

There are no wind components in the GSC 04050−02366 spectra and emissions typical for the spectra of post-AGB
stars, occurring in the atmosphere of a star or in its circumstellar environment. For example, in the spectrum of HD 56126
(IRAS 07134+1005), the time-variable Hα proﬁle usually contains an emission (Klochkova et al. 2007b; Lebre et al. 1996).
In the optical spectra of V510 Pup (IRAS 08005−2356), a powerful emission component is present both in the proﬁles of
hydrogen lines, including the Paschen series lines, and in the selected lines of metal ions (Klochkova and Chentsov 2004).
The spectrum of the central star of the IR source RAFGL 5081 is quite peculiar. This star, like GSC 04050−02366,
has an eﬀective temperature Teﬀ ≈ 5400 K (Klochkova et al. 2017) close to the evolutionary transition from AGB to post-
AGB, according to Soker (2008). In the spectrum of RAFGL 5081, the Hα line has a multicomponent and time-variable
proﬁle, containing a weak emission (Klochkova et al. 2017). However, as follows from Fig. 2, Hα proﬁle in the spectra of
GSC 04050−02366 is almost symmetrical, its absorption core is located near the average velocity Vr=+24.8 km/s for all
times of observation.

In the spectrum of GSC 04050−02366 only forbidden emissions [O I] λ 5577, λ 6300 ˚A of telluric origin are registered.
A weak emission raises the shortwave Hα proﬁle wing only for those two observation dates for which the C2 molecule
Swan band is signiﬁcantly weakened in Fig. 1. This coincidence suggests the presence of asymmetry (or inhomogeneities)
in the envelope.

The diﬀerence of radial velocities given in columns (2) and (4) of Table 2, allows us to estimate the envelope
expansion velocity, Vexp≈16 km/s, which agrees with the result based on the CO proﬁle (Hrivnak and Kwok 1999). If we
consider the summary of Vexp values for post-AGB stars from Klochkova (2014), we can see that the envelope expansion
velocity in the IRAS Z02229 system is typical for the objects of this type. Note here that most of the post-AGB stars
with the envelopes enriched in carbon have a similar envelope morphology (bipolar or elongated halo) and an emission
at λ = 21 µm.

Comparison of results of positional measurements in the spectra we obtained on arbitrary dates of 2019−2021
revealed a variability of the heliocentric radial velocity: averaged over the measurements of the positions of the set of
absorptions, the velocity varies in the range of Vr=20.8 ÷ 26.1 km/s. The presence of Vr variability is also conﬁrmed by
the earlier velocity value Vr=18±1 km/s, given in the paper of Reddy et al. (1999) based on December 1996 observations.
The most probable cause of the radial velocity variability with the amplitude of about ∆Vr≈ 1.4 km/s can be the low-
amplitude pulsations that are typical for post-AGB stars (Aikawa 2010). The star GSC 04050−02366 with its fundamental
parameters falls into the region of Figure 1 in Aikawa (2010), populated with variable post-AGB stars. The presence of
pulsations in the atmosphere of this star is also conﬁrmed by the photometric variability with the amplitude of 0m. 47
based on the observations in the ASAS-SN database.

As a result of studying over the past 2–3 decades of the candidates in post-AGB stars, a group of objects with
atmospheres enriched in s-process heavy metals has been identiﬁed. A complete list of stars of this type with a large
set of data (Teﬀ , luminosity, color excesses, SED, chemical composition of the atmosphere) is published in the survey
by Kamath et al. (2022). Counterparts of GSC 04050−02366 based on the totality of the observed properties (excess of
carbon and heavy metals in the atmospheres, a large color excess owing to the powerful dust envelopes, spectral features
of carbon-containing molecules, emission at λ = 21 µm) are the central stars of the IR-sources IRAS 04296+3429,
IRAS 19500−1709, IRAS 20000+3239, IRAS 22223+4327 and IRAS 23304+6147. Post-AGB stars—the members of this
group—when the main parameters are close, have their own speciﬁc diﬀerences as well. For example, in the optical
spectrum of the post-AGB star V448 Lac in the IR source system IRAS 22223+4327, all group indications are registered:
radial velocity variability, manifestations of the circumstellar envelope in in the form of Swan system bands of the C2
molecule, the asymmetry of strong absorptions of SiII, YII, LaII, BaII ions (Klochkova et al. 2010). At the same time, at
certain dates of observations the spectrum of V448 Lac revealed an emission in the Swan band (Klochkova et al. 2010).
V448 Lac is also included in the reserved group of post-AGB stars with an emission at the wavelength of 21 µm (Volk et al.
1999). This emission does not yet have a speciﬁc identiﬁcation, despite the many proposed versions of (Zhang et al. 2009).
The IR source IRAS 04296+3429 system is also intriguing, which, similar to IRAS Z02229 has a powerful in-
frared ﬂux. The central star GSC 02381−0104 in this system has further advanced to the planetary nebula stage than
GSC 04050−02366, but in general, its fundamental parameters and energy distribution in the spectrum of this system
(Klochkova et al. 1999) are close to those of the IR-source IRAS Z02229 system. The distant star GSC 02381−0104 is
faint for the high-resolution spectroscopy (apparent brightness V> 14m), but its optical spectrum (G8 Ia) is close to that
of GSC 04050−02366, while it holds the record for emission intensity in the (0; 0) and (0; 1) Swan bands (Klochkova et al.
1999). A greater farness of this object from the AGB-phase probably leads to a signiﬁcant expansion of the enevelope,
which contributes to the formation of emission in the circumstellar details.

A nearby relative of GSC 04050−02366 is a post-AGB supergiant V5112 Sgr (IRAS 19500−1709), whose envelope
is also enriched in heavy metals, which manifests itself in the splitting of resonance absorption proﬁles (Klochkova 2013).
Along with this, the peculiarity of the optical spectrum of V5112 Sgr is more pronounced: the proﬁles of strong BaII
absorptions are split into three components. Two shortwave components origin in two diﬀerent layers of the structured
envelope of the star, formed at two previous stages of the evolution of the star and expanding with the velocities of
Vexp≈ 20 and 30 km/s.

The cool post-AGB supergiant GSC 04050−02366 belongs to the group of single post-AGB stars that have passed
the stage with the eﬀective s-process and the third mixing. This group currently includes about two dozen stars, all of
them are listed in the surveys by Klochkova (1997, 2019b); Kamath et al. (2022). The splitting of resonant absorptions
of metals due to their removal to the circumstellar environment was found in the spectra of only four of them.

5. Main conclusions

The main new results of this study are as follows:

1) detection of a temporal radial velocity variability based on the positional measurements of a great many of metal
absorptions. The velocity Vr varies around the mean value of Vr=24.75 km/s with the standard deviation from the
mean of ∆Vr=1.4 km/s, which may be a consequence of low-amplitude pulsations in the atmosphere;

2) detection of a temporal variability of the proﬁles of spectral features, including the intensity of most of absorptions
and Swan bands of the C2 molecule, as well as a weak Hα proﬁle variability;

3) detection of splitting into two components (or asymmetries) of strong low excitation absorptions (YII, ZrII, BaII,
LaII, NdII). The longwave component, whose position is consistent with the position of symmetrical absorptions of
other metals is formed in the atmosphere of the star;

4) the position of the short-wave component of the split absorptions coincides with the position of the Swan bands
features, which points to its formation in the circumstellar envelope expanding at a velocity of about Vexp=16 km/s.
Therefore, the post-AGB supergiant GSC 04050−02366 is the fourth object in the group of stars for which the takeaway
of the s-process heavy metals into the circumstellar envelope was discovered.
