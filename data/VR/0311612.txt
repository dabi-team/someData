ABSTRACT

We have measured the proper motion (PM) and kinematics of the ansae in
NGC 7009 using high dispersion echelle spectra and archive narrow band HST
images. Assuming that the ansae are moving at equal and opposite velocities
from the central star we obtain a system radial velocity of −53 ± 2 km.s−1, the
eastern ansa approaching and the western ansa receding at vr = 5.3 ± 1 km.s−1
with respect to this value. The PM of the eastern ansa is 28 ± 8 mas.yr−1, which
with our weighted distance to NGC 7009 of 0.86 ± 0.34 kpc gives Vexp = 112 ± 32
km.s−1. The electron temperature and density in both ansae were determined to
be Te ∼ 9000 ± 400 K and ne ∼ 2300 ± 400 cm−3. The dynamic age of the ansae
is ∼ 925 ± 260 yrs. and the implied PM of the central star is µCS = 1 ± 0.5
mas.yr−1. This is in qualitative but not quantitative agreement with previous
work.

Introduction

Most low and intermediate mass stars become White Dwarfs after a brief phase as
Planetary Nebulae (PNe) caused by heavy mass loss on the AGB (Iben & Renzini 1983).

Symmetrical and mildly asymmetrical PNe are explained by versions of the interacting wind
model (Kwok et al. 1978) but the mechanisms causing the strong asymmetries observed in
the majority of PNe are still unexplained. That both binaries and magnetic ﬁelds probably
play a role is now generally accepted. For an overview of formation mechanisms, models,
and asymmetries see Kastner et al. (2000).

The wealth of diﬀerent PNe shapes is shown in Balick (1987) and Schwarz et al. (1992),
and features have been described in detail by many authors: e.g. point symmetry (Schwarz
1993), bipolarity (e.g. Corradi & Schwarz 1995), multipolarity (Sahai & Trauger 1998),
BRETS (L´opez 1997) and Fast, Low Ionization Emission Regions or FLIERS (Balick et al.
1994) are all used to indicate the various observed morphologies.

NGC7009 has long been known to have a complex morphology. Aller (1941) described
the outer features as ansae (handles in Latin), and work by Reay & Atherton (1985), and
Balick et al. (1987) show that these ansae are expanding near the plane of the sky at high
velocities (∼ 102 km/s) relative to the nucleus.

Liller (1965) used photographic plate material to analyze the expansion of NGC7009,

including the ansae, for which they obtained 16 ± 3 mas.yr−1.

In this paper we present the kinematics and proper motion of the ansae using observa-
tional material from the HST and CTIO 4m echelle spectrograph, and show that the previous
results are qualitatively but not quantitatively correct.

2. Observations and data reduction

We extracted two sets of archive HST images with the “On the ﬂy” option. The WFPC2
sets were taken on 1996.04.28 (Balick et al. 1998) and on 2001.05.11 (Palen et al. 2002) in
an Hα/[NII] ﬁlter.

The 2001 images are shifted 20 ” east from the 1996 images. As the latter covered the
entire nebula, in the former the west ansa disappears from the ﬁeld of view. The two images
showed in Figure 1 are an average (for cosmic ray rejection) of each set.

We took CTIO 4m echelle spectra on 2002.07.29 with a spectral range between 410–
720nm, and a slit of 1.2′′ × 6.6′′. The mean seeing was 1.4′′. Flux calibration to 10% was
done with 58 Aql (HR 7596, Hamuy et al. 1992). The spectra were reduced in the usual
way, using IRAF, and resulted in an rms wavelength error of 0.00037nm, with residuals of
≤ 0.00075nm. Velocity resolution was 3.7 km.s−1.pix−1 or 10.2 km.s−1 for our slit width at
650nm.

Fig. 1.— Average of the set of HST images taken in 1996 (left) and 2001 (right). North is
down-left and east is down-right, and each image is 120” by 120”. There is a shift of 20 ”
in the east-west direction between them, which makes the western ansa disappear from the
2001 images. The two background stars marked with circles were used together with the CS
as reference points for proper motion calculation.

3. Results

3.1. Distance & proper motion

The distance to NGC 7009 is uncertain, but we computed the weighted average of the

14 available (Acker et al. 1992) values to be d = 0.86 ± 0.34 kpc.

The measurement of the central star’s position was made with the IRAF task imcentroid.
For the measurement of the position of the ansa, we conﬁned it inside a box of 5” square and
computed the centroid, using the imcentroid task and measured their displacements with
respect to the central star (CS) and two ﬁeld stars (shown in Figure 1) in two ways: the
displacements were measured in all the images, and an average displacement was obtained
for each epoch; next, the displacements were computed from the averages of the images for
each epoch. The centroid positions given in pixel values were converted to RA and DEC
using the metric task, within the stsdas package. This task corrects for the known geometric
distortions between diﬀerent CCDs. The diﬀerences in the results are an order of magnitude
smaller than the errors derived from centroid calculation and measurements between diﬀerent
chips. The various diﬀerential images are shown in Figure 2.

The displacements between the CS and the ansae are: 24.85±0.06′′& 25.01± 0.05′′(E;
1996 & 2001) and 26.77± 0.06′′(W; 1996 only). The detailed measurements with their
respective errors are shown in Table 1. Note that the adjusted standard deviations for 1996
and 2001 results are 0.01 and 9.6.10−3 respectively.

Even though this is a good determination for the angular displacement of the eastern
ansa, it is also possible that the central star is moving. Therefore, it is important to have
other reference points. The circles in Figure 1 indicate the position of the two ﬁeld stars
present on the images that could be measured. The angular displacements of the ansae in
each frame are listed in Table 2. These measurement are all equal within the errors.

The value we adopted for the displacement was the least squares shift of all measure-
ments: 0′′.14± 0′′.04. The time between images is 158883733s or ≈ 5yrs. computed from
the start time of the exposures, yielding a proper motion of the E ansa of 0′′.028 ± 0′′.008
yr−1, and the tangential velocity is Vexp = 112 ± 32 km.s−1 for d = 860pc.

We note that the rim of the inner nebulae also shows diﬀerential motion in more or
less the same direction as that of the ansae between the 1996 and 2001 images. We do not
attempt to compute the proper motion as this rim is likely to be a moving ionization front

with a very diﬀerent velocity than that of the bulk motion of the gas (weak R-front, Mellema
(2003)). This is unlikely to be the case for the ansae.

3.2. Radial Velocities

We computed the mean observed radial velocities of the ansae from 10 emission lines
ﬁtted with a Voigt proﬁle to be −58.5 ± 1.9 km.s−1 (E) and −47.9 ± 1.6 km.s−1 (W). When
using only the [NII] and Hα lines (the HST images were taken in these lines) we obtain
−58.3 ± 1.1 km.s−1 (E) and −47.7 ± 0.8 km.s−1 (W). The radial velocity diﬀerences between
the E and W ansae are: ∆Hα[N II] = 10.6 ± 1.4 km.s−1 and ∆All = 10.6 ± 2.5 km.s−1. We also
separately computed the mean values of the velocity for the forbidden and for the permitted
lines. They were also the same to within the errors. The observed radial velocities for
each detected emission line are listed in Table 3, and we also give the heliocentric and LSR
velocities and their average values.

3.3. Electron temperatures and densities

The line intensities of [NII] and [SII] were measured by ﬁtting Voigt proﬁles to derive
the electron temperature and density in both ansae. The line intensities were corrected for
reddening, assuming a recombination model B with T = 104 K and ne = 104 cm−3, and
an extinction coeﬃcient cβ = 0.26 (Lame & Pogge 1996). The line intensity ratios together
with electron temperatures and densities derived from them are listed in Table 4. The latter
results were obtained using the formulae from McCall (1984). The errors in the ratios were
calculated from the S/N in each line.

4. Discussion

Our radial velocities agree with those of Reay & Atherton (1985), who determined

± 6.2 km.s−1 using the [OI]6300 line. We get ± 6.1 km.s−1 using the same line.

– 8 –

Liller (1965) computes 16 mas.yr−1 for the angular expansion of the ansae; we obtain
28 ± 8 mas.yr−1. This diﬀerence is probably due to the low resolution of the photographic
plates, as Liller comments: “....the plate scale is such that photographic grain often competes
with seeing as the limiting factor in image deﬁnition”.

If the ansae were ejected at the same time from the CS and with equal & opposite
velocities, we can determine the PM of the CS (relative to the point of ejection, assumed
ﬁxed in space) and the age of the ansae from our data. We ﬁnd that the CS has moved
0.96± 0.04 ” since the ejection of the ansae, 920± 260 yrs ago. This gives a proper motion
for the CS of 1± 0.5 mas.yr−1 or 5 mas between our two epochs, negligible cf. the motion of
the ansae.

In the gas of NGC7009, the sound speed is about 10 km.s−1, implying that the ansae

move at supersonic speeds.

The Te and ne we obtain are similar to those found by others: Balick et al. (1994) quote
a value of Te = 8100K & ne = 1000 cm−3; Bohigas, L´opez & Aguilar (1994) quote a value of
Te = 9800K & ne = 2300 cm−3, both for the W ansa.

5. Conclusions

We conclude that the ansae in NGC7009 –which is at a distance of 860± 340pc– move
outward at the supersonic velocity of ± 112 km.s−1 near the plane of the sky (2.6 ± 1 degrees),
have a dynamic age of 920± 260 yrs, a proper motion of 28 ± 8 mas.yr−1, and that the CS
likely moves at 1 ± 0.5 mas.yr−1.
