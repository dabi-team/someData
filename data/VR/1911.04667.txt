ABSTRACT
We propose a concept of a novel interaction strategy for providing
rich haptic feedback in Virtual Reality (VR), when each user’s finger
is connected to micro-quadrotor with a wire. Described technology
represents the first flying wearable haptic interface. The solution
potentially is able to deliver high resolution force feedback to each
finger during fine motor interaction in VR. The tips of tethers
are connected to the centers of quadcopters under their bottom.
Therefore, flight stability is increasing and the interaction forces
are becoming stronger which allows to use smaller drones.

CCS CONCEPTS
• Human-centered computing → Virtual reality; Haptic de-
vices.

1 INTRODUCTION
A noticeable part of human-robot interaction involves the usage
of haptic and tactile feedback [Akahane et al. 2013; Tsykunov et al.
2019]. Along with that, there are several research projects related
to providing encountered-type kinesthetic and tactile feedback in
VR via drones.

In [Hoppe et al. 2018], an object or surface is connected to the
drone which is supposed to be touched by a human to deliver
passive or active tactile feedback. Authors in [Knierim et al. 2017]
also propose to hit the user with some object connected to a small
drone to provide a haptic sensation. Abdullah et al. in [Abdullah
et al. 2018] also proposed to push or pull the drone in Z − axis
direction to simulate force feedback for direct interaction. Abtahi et
al. in their paper [Abtahi et al. 2019] developed more complicated

scenario which incorporates rich interactions including passive
force feedback and texture mapping.

The main limitations of the proposed solutions include low sen-
sation resolution, instability during interaction, low impact force,
and big size of a drone. In particular, authors in [Abdullah et al.
2018; Abtahi et al. 2019] selected bigger size drones. Usually spacial
motion of human hands is fast. Although more powerful quadrotors
could provide more noticeable force feedback, they could be slow
for certain application. It is also hard to combine different types of
feedback at the same time because there are not enough space for
drones near the fingers.

2 MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS
In contrast with the discussed works, we propose to connect multi-
ple micro-quadrotors and each finger with leashes. String is able to
deliver a force vector (direction and magnitude) directly from the
drone to the finger.

2.1 High sensation resolution
Due to the leash length, the drones are not in the close proximity
near the fingers, therefore we can use multiple of them to deliver
haptic feedback to the close regions - neighbour fingers (shown
in Fig. 1). One option is to use one drone to deliver force to each
finger. Another way is to combine five fingers into three groups
and connect one drone to each group.

Two drones with different tether properties can be connected to
the same finger. Combination of different types of leash (e.g., elastic
or non-stretchable) could deliver a rich kinaesthetic feedback.

Using more that one drone allows to create high resolution
encountered-type haptic feedback. In this case each finger has to
be tracked by a localization system, such as Leap Motion.

2.2 Flight stability
During the interaction session the drones are not visible in VR,
which rises additional safety challenges. Usual physical interaction
strategy involves direct contact between the fingers and some part
of the drone. The point of contact is far from the center of the
drone [Abtahi et al. 2019; Hoppe et al. 2018], which generates high
and sudden external moment. Such a high moment leads to the
instabilities which are hard to overcome by a flight controller.

In the proposed solution tether is connected to the center of
the drone under the bottom providing higher flight stability. The
suggested design implies the selection of leash properties. One
option is to make an elastic leash, which ensures smooth interaction
and more safe flight.

2.3 Higher impact force
Each rotor, rotating at speed ωi produces a force and a momentum
which are defined as:

Fi = kf ω2

i , Mi = kmω2
i

(1)

where kf is the force coefficient, km is the momentum coefficient,
i = 1, 2, 3, 4 for the quadrotor [Mahony et al. 2012]. The resulting
control inputs to the drone frame are expressed as:

The coordinate systems of the drone and world frame are defined
as D and W , respectively. The majority of conducted research [Ab-
tahi et al. 2019; Hoppe et al. 2018; Knierim et al. 2017] utilize force
u1 that is produced by the rotors in xW or yW direction. However,
u1 acts along zD axis. During the interaction with human, drones
usually avoid highly aggressive maneuvers with high acceleration,
pitch, and roll angles, which produces small zD inclination. Force
calculated as u1zD has a small horizontal term (along xW and yW
axis), and, therefore, the impact with human is negligible.

Authors in [Abtahi et al. 2019] also partially employ the moments

u2 and u3 for the surface stiffness simulation. u2 defined as:

u2 = kf ω2

2L − kf ω2
4L

(3)

It is possible to see from (3) that the potential impact from moment
(combination of u2 and u3) is limited, comparing to u1. Only up to
two rotors actually contribute to the force feedback. In addition, u1
which requires a lot of power, suffers from highlighting u2 and u3.
We propose the concept in which the tether is connected to the
bottom of the quadrotor and the main force direction is along zw
axis. Therefore, the most powerful control input u1 is used to deliver
the force feedback while the drone is in well-stabilized position.

3 SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
We used Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotors and Robot Operating System
(ROS) environment for the drone control. The state of the human
hand and drones (position and orientation) are estimated with a
Vicon motion capture system (12 Vantage V5 cameras are covering
5m × 5m × 5m space). The position and attitude update rate was
100 Hz for all drones. For easy setup, we propose to connect the
tethers to the fingers with magnets.

Drones follow the human hand while the user is moving in the
virtual scene. We propose to predict the intersection between the
human hand and the virtual object and the corresponding drones
become activated and provide fine force feedback.

4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The novel type of device, flying wearable glove, was developed by us.
This type of the haptic interface considerably increases the working
area comparing with the desktop type devices. Additionally, it does
not produce fatigue to the user, as it is often the case with wearable
devices, because of zero weight.

Specifically, the proposed technology provides strong advan-
tages for rendering the interaction with horizontal virtual surfaces.
For example, playing virtual musical instruments, e.g., virtual pi-
ano can be a scenario for its application. Moreover, application of
WiredSwarm in VR surgical simulator will allow the user to feel
the interaction with tissue, muscles, and bones.

WiredSwarm technology can be extended to deliver haptic sen-
sation not only to the fingers but also to forearms and upper arms.
To achieve rendering of textures of virtual objects it is reasonable
to integrate vibromotors at the lower tip of the strings. In the future
work we will add experimental data and theoretical analysis on the
stability, resolution of force feedback, validation in a VR scenario.
