ABSTRACT

Virtual reality (VR) is an imminent trend in games, education, entertainment, military, and health
applications, as the use of head-mounted displays is becoming accessible to the mass market. Virtual
reality provides immersive experiences but still does not offer an entirely perfect situation, mainly
due to Cybersickness (CS) issues. In this work we ﬁrst present a detailed review about possible
causes of CS. Following, we propose a novel CS prediction solution. Our system is able to suggest
if the user may be entering in the next moments of the application into a illness situation. We
use Random Forest classiﬁers, based on a dataset we have produced. The CSPQ (Cybersickness
Proﬁle Questionnaire) is also proposed, which is used to identify the player’s susceptibility to CS
and the dataset construction. In addition, we designed two immersive environments for empirical
studies where participants are asked to complete the questionnaire and describe (orally) the degree
of discomfort during their gaming experience. Our data was achieved through 84 individuals on
different days, using VR devices. Our proposal also allows to identify which are the most frequent
attributes (causes) in the observed discomfort situations.

Introduction

We are currently experiencing the birth and development of a new entertainment platform. Virtual Reality (VR) delivers
immersive 3D graphics in entertainment applications, serious games, and training applications in health, technological,
military, or scientiﬁc domains.

Meanwhile, most users that experience head-mounted displays activities feel one or more symptoms of sickness,
primarily if the user is subjected for a long period of time [1]. According to Ramsey et al. [2], on average, eighty
percent of participants who experienced VR with Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) felt discomfort after the ﬁrst 10
minutes of exposure. Therefore, more extensive VR activities tend to cause stronger discomfort levels. However, the
level of discomfort still varies from individual to individual.

Figure 1: The methodology proposed in this work.

According to Hua [3], minimizing sickness in virtual and augmented reality applications is an unresolved challenge.
Discomfort resulting from VR can arise from three different leading causes: motion sickness, Visually Induced Motion
Sickness (VIMS), CyberSickness (CS) or simulator sickness.

Motion sickness is manifested by the divergence of information emitted by the human sensory system. This happens
when conﬂicts between the sensory organs that deﬁne orientation and position in space occur. Motion Sickness (MS)
is deﬁned as the manifestation of discomfort during a forced visual movement (without the movement of the body),
for example, during airplane ﬂights, boat trips, or even with land vehicles [4], [5], [6], [7]. This uncomfortable
experience also occurs in virtual environments and it is called Visually Induced Motion Disease.

VIMS symptoms are similar to MS. However, the difference lays on the fact that there is no physical movement in
VIMS or they are extremely limited [8]. Several studies categorized VIMS as MS symptoms when situations of visual
stimulation manifest irrespective of physical movements. Due to that, different studies in different VIMS contexts were
renamed to match the set of symptoms according to the environment they manifested.

Merhi et al. [9] deﬁne the occurrence of VIMS during experiments with video games as game sickness, Brooks et
al. [10] deﬁne the occurrence of VIMS in simulators as simulator sickness and McCauley and Thomas [11] deﬁne
VIMS as occurring speciﬁcally in virtual reality systems as CS. The CS, in turn, is comparable to the symptoms of MS
occurring in the real world, such as nausea, vertigo, dizziness, stomach problems, and others [12]. Symptoms of CS
mainly occur with head-mounted displays (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, among others) [13].

This work investigates the causes and solutions to CS while describing each current methodology. We also propose a
novel classiﬁcation solution for predicting the level of discomfort while using head mounted displays. The literature
still lacks a comprehensive description of cybersickness and related topics, with most works consisting of empirical
observations and reports [14], [15], [16].

As shown in Figure 1, we collected data from a personal questionnaire, from the game play experience while the user
was emerged in VR. Classiﬁers were used to predict the discomfort level of the user over the gameplay. The experiments
were separated in binary and quaterly classiﬁcations, where in the binary case the labels slight, moderate and severe
were merged into one: discomfort. The performance of classiﬁers is analysed and we also provide an attribute ranking
analysis before presenting the conclusions.

2 Related Work

In this section, we review related works, which are addressed in 3 categories related to CS: causes, strategies, and
prediction.

A PREPRINT - JUNE 30, 2020

2.1 Causes

Several factors can cause pain and discomfort when using head-mounted displays [17], [18]. Manifestations of CS can
lead to more intense symptoms, such as nausea, eye fatigue, neuralgia, and dizziness [19]. According to the literature
[20], [21], [22], [23], it is possible to highlight the main factors that contribute to the manifestation of CS symptoms
and the main strategies to minimize it.

1. Locomotion - According to Rebenitsch, 2016 [13], locomotion interaction speed, in this case, the movement,
is correlated to cybersickness (CS). Experiences where the participant has greater control of his movements
and is close to natural movements of the human body tend to manifest less cybersickness.

2. Acceleration - Visual accelerations without producing the response in the correspondent vestibular organ
cause uncomfortable sensations that result in CS symptoms. High accelerations during movements contribute
more to CS [24], [25].

3. Field of View - Decreasing the FOV display can mitigate the simulator disease [18], [22]. However, this also

decreases the immersion level.

4. Depth of Field - Inadequate simulation of focus on stereoscopic HMDs with ﬂow tracking devices creates
incredible images and, consequently, causes discomfort. In the human eye, focus forces blur effects naturally
and according to the depth of ﬁeld (DoF) and distance range of objects in the observed area [26]. Due to
ocular convergence, objects outside this range, located behind or in front of the eyes, are blurred [27].

5. Degree of Control - According to Stanney and Keneddy [25] some facts suggest that CS can be mitigated by
using experiences with a high level of control in terms of user movements in the virtual world, the authors use
the real example of a car driver being much less susceptible to symptoms of discomfort than other passengers
who are in the same vehicle.

6. Exposure - In a previous research [28], researchers showed that discomfort levels rise proportionally over

time.

7. Latency - or lag, has persisted for years as an obstacle in the preceding generations of HMDs [29], [30].
Latency is the time difference between the user input and the correspondent action within a virtual scenario to
take place.

8. Static Rest Frame - The lack of a static frame of reference (static rest frame) can cause sensory conﬂicts and,

ultimately, cybersickness.

9. Camera Rotation - Rotations in virtual environments with HMDs increase the chances of sensory conﬂicts
occurring. According to the study of Bonato et al. [31], the feeling of vection is greater in rotations when 2
axes are considered in comparison to just 1 axis. The work of Bubka et al. [32] reafﬁrms the study of Bonato
et al. However, Bubka et al. report that many individuals spontaneously reported symptoms of discomfort
after many hours after the end of the experience with the VR environment.

10. Postural Instability - Postural instability (Ataxia) is a postural imbalance or lack of coordination [24] [33]
caused when the body tries to maintain an incorrect posture due to the sensory conﬂict caused by the virtual
environment. In other words, postural instability is the reactive response to information received by the
vestibular and visual organs.

2.2 Strategies

Several factors can induce the manifestation of CS symptoms during exposure in virtual reality environments. This
manifestation can lead to profound malaise effects, such as nausea, eye fatigue, and dizziness. According to the
literature, these problems can be mitigated in several ways:

• Locomotion Strategies - Teleportation techniques assist with the mobility problem in virtual reality environ-
ments. In this strategy, the user can travel great distances by specifying the destination point of the trip, using
a wand or marker at the destination point [34]. Another technique is known as the trigger walk, and this uses
the concept of a natural walk to reach a particular destination. With each trigger pull, the user moves one step
towards the indicated direction [35].

• Acceleration Strategies - According to Berthoz et al. [36] it is possible to induce the sensation of movement
using haptic feedback. However, according to Pavard et al. [37], the human visual system can adapt to the
illusory movement, but cannot addapt to acceleration. According to Plouzeau et al.
[38], it is possible to
measure acceleration as a function of CS in RVs using an EDA (electro-dermal activity). According to surveys
[39], [40], the more predictable the movement and acceleration of the camera, the less effects of CS. The

technique of slow-motion effects provides less sudden movements and a lower rate of acceleration. This effect
works best combined with the blur strategy.

• Field of View Strategies - Vignette is a technique to gradually reduce the ﬁeld of view in order to reduce
uncomfortable sensations in virtual reality environments [41]. In the work of Norouzi et al. [42], a variation of
this technique where the vignette size and dynamic ﬁeld of view (FOV) are related to the camera acceleration
was applied. The Tunneling [43] strategy is also used, which reduces the size of the user ﬁeld of view at the
exact moment of the motion.

• Depth of Field Strategies - Some works include a depth of ﬁeld simulation (DoF) broker with software blur
to minimize the problem of vergence and accommodation [17], [28]. The solution presented by Carnegie and
Rhee [17] pointed to the reduction of the discomfort in HMD applications. More clearly, they suggested a
GPU-based solution for DoF simulation in these applications.

• Rotation Movement Strategies - Several works applied techniques such as the ampliﬁcation of movements
made by the head [44], [38]. Another example, rotation blurring, which is a technique implemented by
Budhiraja et al.
[45], applies a smooth gaussian blur to the image based on the magnitude value of the
accelerating rotation.

• Exposure Strategies - The CS level of participants increases proportionally in relation to the time of exposure
to the VR environment [28], [46]. Therefore, users are advised to periodically take a break out of VR in order
to avoid symptoms of discomfort.

• Rest Frames Strategies - People tolerate longer exposures without feeling discomfort when projections
systems are considered (example: CAVES). One of the biggest differences between VR and projection systems
is the rest frames. In projection-based systems, the edges of the screen and elements of the real world are
visible beyond the screens and act as resting frames [47]. According to Duh et al. [48], VR developers should
create suggestions for rest frames whenever possible.

2.3 Prediction

Garcia-Agundez et al. [49] aimed to classify the level of CS. The model follows a combination of bio-signal and game
settings. They collected user signals like respiratory and skin conductivity from a total of 66 participants. As a result,
they mentioned a classiﬁcation accuracy of 82% for binary classiﬁcation and 56% for ternary.

Jin et al. [50] separates factors that cause cybersickness in 3 groups: hardware characteristics (VR device settings and
features), software characteristics (the content of the VR scenes), and the individual user. The authors used classiﬁers to
predict the level of discomfort. A total of 3 machine learning algorithms (CNN, LSTM-RNN, and SVR) were used.
According to the results, the LSTM-RNN was the most viable model for the case.

In this work, we classify the level of cybersickness using parameters from an interactive game scene; this brings the
works of Garcia-Agundez et al. and Jin et al. closer to our goal. Both aim to classify CS before and/or after the
experience. In this work, we consider the entire VR experience, which means: before, during, and after the participation.

3 Methodology

Our feature set is composed of 34 attributes, divided into four groups:

• User Proﬁle Data: The proﬁle data was selected based on the literature and also on the experience acquired
during pilot tests of this work, we gathered this data through our Cybersickness Proﬁle Questionnaire (CSPQ).
The CSPQ contains questions such as gender, age, level of experience with VR, existence of any pre-symptoms
and ﬂicker sensibility. We also include information about whether the individual wears glasses, has any vision
impairments, information regarding the posture during the experiment (standing or sitting), and which eye is
the dominant eye.

Figure 2: The two games that were developed for this work (ﬂight game at the left and race game at the right).

• Questionnaire Data: Information ﬁlled in by the user about discomfort symptoms before and after the
experiment. The symptoms listed are from the VRSQ (Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire) [51], which is
a modiﬁed version of Kennedy’s traditional SSQ (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire) to address environments
virtual reality with HMDs speciﬁcally.

• Game data: Information such as (1) time stamp, (2) speed, (3) acceleration, (4) player rotation axis, (5) player
position, (6) region of interest, (7) size of the FOV, (8) frame rate and (9) discomfort level, which is the class
and is reported by the user at any time during the gameplay experience.

• Game conﬁguration data: Boolean information towards the (1) existence of static resting frames, (2)
existence of haptic response, (3) level of user control over the camera, (4) existence of depth of ﬁeld simulation
(DoF) and (5) whether the game primary camera moves automatically (without user intervention). These data
were selected based on the list of strategies shown in Table 1.

Two games were created for this work: a race and a ﬂight game. The games (made with Unity 3D) are part of the
complete software solution for this work. We collected data from a total 37 participants (9 female and 28 male) with
ages ranging between 18 and 60. The participants were able to quit the experiment whenever they wanted. Each
individual was asked to:

• Task 1 - Fill in the proﬁle questionnaire - CSPQ
• Task 2 - Fill in the virtual reality sickness questionnaire VRSQ (Q1)
• Task 3 - Participate in one of the VR games for up to 5 minutes (if possible).
• Task 4 - Fill in the virtual reality sickness questionnaire VRSQ (Q2).

Both games (racing and ﬂight) try to force the participant to perform habitual VR game movements, such as rotation,
translation, and perform acceleration changes. These movements can cause one or more symptoms of discomfort.
Figure 2 shows two players using HDM playing both games (ﬂight at left and race at right).

Once the data is collected, machine learning algorithms were trained to classify the CS. Each of the inputs stored by the
experiment contains a rating given by users related to discomfort (from 0 to 3, where 0 is none and 3 is severe) during
gameplay.

To further analyse the collected data, we seperate the experiments in three main scenarios: A, B and C. In what follows,
these scenarios are described:

• Scenario A - Classiﬁcation consisting of data from the racing game (3993 samples).
• Scenario B - Classiﬁcation consisting of data from the ﬂight game (5397 samples).
• Scenario C - Classiﬁcation using data from both scenarios together -A and B- (9390 samples).

The following classiﬁers were evaluated: BF Tree, CDT, Decision Strump, ForestPA, FT, Hoeffding, J48, J48 Graft,
JCHAID Star, LAD Tree, LMT, Nb Tree, Random Forest, Random Tree, Rep Tree, and Simple Cart. Experiments were

run using a 10-fold cross-validation in all scenarios. We also separated scenarios A, B and C into two new groups. The
ﬁrst group is a binary classiﬁcation (0-none or 1-discomfort, which includes from slight to severe classes). The second
group is a quaterly classiﬁcation containing all four classes (none, slight, moderate and severe). The distribution of
classes can be seen in Figure 3.

4 Results

It was using the valid race game data with a total of 3993 samples. We observed that the occurrence of the discomfort
reported by individuals occurs throughout the track (in Figure 4). However, the discomfort levels in speciﬁcs regions of
track have a more signiﬁcant accumulation.

In a comparative sample of reports of discomfort between individuals of the female gender (7 females with 1772
samples) and male (8 males with 2221 samples), We observed that in an accumulated result, the male participants
reported discomfort values greater than zero more often than individuals of the female gender (illustrated in Figure 5).

Biocca [52] and Kolasinski [23], who report those female individuals are more susceptible to symptoms of MS. Despite
being similar diseases, they have different environments and manifestations. Because of this, for this case, there is no
way to say if there is a difference between genders for the manifestation of CS-based only on the works cited in this
thesis. However, the results of this stage showed, in this speciﬁc testing stage, that the female audience reported less
discomfort compared to the male audience.

Table 3,4 shows the Accuracy and Kappa index for binary and quarterly classiﬁcations over scenarios A, B and C.

4.1 Binary Classiﬁcation

As previously mentioned, we also merged the discomfort level into a single class in order to perform binary classiﬁca-
tions, which are usually stronger than non-binary ones. Discomfort values that were previously represented as slight,
moderate, and severe are represented as discomfort.

In Scenario A, B, and C, the Random Forest classiﬁer proved to be the best with an accuracy of 94.0%, 99.0%, and
96.6% for the binary case.

4.2 Quarterly Classiﬁcation

For the quarterly classiﬁcation, the dataset was kept unchanged. This set of experiments contain 4 classes: none, slight,
moderate and severe. In Scenario A, the classiﬁer LMT (Logistic Model Trees) achieved the best result, which reached
the accuracy of 92.4%. In the Scenario B, the best result was obtained with Random Forest (98.9%). For Scenario C,
Random Forest also obtained the best classiﬁcation accuracy (95.4%).

4.2.1 Attribute Selection

We used the Classiﬁer Attribute Evaluator (using full set training with "leave one attribute out" method) in the Weka
machine learning framework to generate a ranking of all attributes using the best classiﬁer of the previous experiments
(Tables 3 and 4). This algorithm removes attributes from the dataset and evaluates how its removal impacts on the
performance of the classiﬁcation. After all attributes are evaluated, they are ranked in terms of impact. The best ones
stay at the top of the ranking.

For binary classiﬁcations and scenario A (racing game), the 5 most relevant attributes were: Time Stamp, Age, Gender,
Rotation on the z axis (CameraRotationZ) and Player Speed. For Scenario B (ﬂight game), the attribute ranking was
given as follows: Age, Position on the z axis (PlayerPositionZ), Experience, Vision Impairment and Rotation on the z
axis (CameraRotationZ).

These attributes ranked at the ﬁrst 5 positions for the different scenarios corroborates with the literature. For 2 out of 3
test scenarios, the time stamp was considered the most important for the classiﬁcation of discomfort. Player Speed,
Rotation (CameraRotationZ) as well as Gender and Age were also essential attributes.

In quarterly classiﬁcations, we obtained similar results. For Scenario A: Time Stamp, Age, Genre, Experience and
Player Speed were the top 5. Scenario B, the most relevant attributes were: Age, Position on the z axis (Player-

5 Conclusion

This is the ﬁrst work to use classiﬁers in order to predict discomfort over the track during the gameplay experience
considering a broad feature set, which includes user personal data. We also publicly provide the user data .

We built a data visualization application and performed a ﬁrst analysis of the collected data. It is possible to observe
that in 3993 samples of the racing game, most occurrences of discomfort reported by the participants occurred near or
during curves of the virtual track, which reinforces the association of CS to rotations. We also made an analysis between
genders which showed that female individuals reported lower incidents of discomfort compared to male participants in
our data.

Subsequently, the analysis in terms of machine learning consisted of three scenarios: Scenario A (data from the racing
game), Scenario B (data from the ﬂying game) and Scenario C (data from both games). We performed supervised binary
and quarterly classiﬁcations using 16 decision tree classiﬁers. Classiﬁers that resulted in the highest accuracy were:
Random Forests (Random Forest) and LMT (Logist Model Trees). The best accuracy was 99.0% and was obtained with
the Random Forest classiﬁer for scenario B (ﬂight game) in the binary classiﬁcation.

An attribute selection was also performed in order to identify the most relevant attributes. For all scenarios it was
observed that the most relevant attributes were the same, being: (time, position, and z-axis rotation) and proﬁle attributes
of the individual. These results corroborates the importance of attributes related to the individuals in the prediction
of CS. This assessment reinforces the theories and hypothesis present in the literature known so far. Time is notably
essential for the prediction of discomfort in virtual reality environments.

6 Next Steps

To construct a complete methodology, that contemplates the CS prediction and the automatic suggestion of strategies to
minimize the CS. It will be necessary to overcome the following challenges:

• Application and analysis of association rules in the data set of this thesis.

• Flight game analysis and inclusion of graphical visualization of discomfort.

• Realization of a new stage of experiment with individuals standing.

Figure 6: Updated methodology diagram overview. At the present moment of this thesis, the stage of automatic strategy
suggestion to minimize CS is listed as work in progress.

• Training with recurrent neural network model (LSTM).
• Investigation of alternatives with deep learning networks.
• Research on how to carry out automatic strategy suggestions with the value resulting from discomfort in

real-time.

• Inclusion of new attributes (in a synthetic way), with the captured data, for example, distances between the

player and the movement limits of the scenarios, total distance covered.

• Implementation of the ﬁnal game application in virtual reality with the prediction of the level of discomfort

and strategy suggestion in real-time.

• Weight modeling for the proﬁle questionnaire (CSPQ).

As far as is known, most CS causes can have one or more minimization strategies. Based on this knowledge, the present
methodology divides the problem of automatically suggesting in the following steps (Figure 6):

• Research: Identiﬁcation and association of causes and strategies
• Experiments: Application development, tests with participants, data collection and pre-elimination analysis
• CS Prediction (CS Prediction): classiﬁers, Training, binary classiﬁcation, quaternary classiﬁcation, attribute

ranking, association rules.

• Suggestion of CS minimization strategy (Strategies Suggestion).
