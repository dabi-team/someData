Abstract

Resonant ﬁeld ampliﬁcation, which may lead to locking or error ﬁeld penetration, involves driving

a weakly stable tearing perturbation in a rotating toroidal plasma. In this paper it is shown that

the locking characteristics for modes with ﬁnite real frequencies ωr are quite diﬀerent from the

conventional results. A calculation of the tearing mode amplitude assuming modes with frequencies

±ωr in the plasma frame shows that it is maximized when the frequency of the stable backward

propagating mode (−ωr) is zero, i.e. when v = ωr/k. Even more importantly, the locking torque

is exactly zero at the mode phase velocity, with a pronounced peak at just higher rotation, leading

to a locked state with plasma velocity v just above the mode phase velocity in the lab frame. Real

frequencies are known to occur due to the Glasser eﬀect[1, 2] for modes in the resistive-inertial

(RI) regime. This therefore leads to locking of the plasma velocity to just above the phase velocity.

It is also shown here that real frequencies occur over a wide range of parameters in the visco-

resistive (VR) regime with pressure, and the locking torque is similar to that in the RI regime.

The same is true in other tearing regimes, with real frequencies due to diamagnetic propagation.

Other nonlinear eﬀects and the possibility of applying external ﬁelds of diﬀerent helicities to drive

sheared ﬂows in toroidal plasmas are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Resonant ﬁeld ampliﬁcation[7] (RFA) is the response of a magnetically conﬁned toroidal

plasma to an externally applied nonaxisymmetric magnetic ﬁeld, an error ﬁeld. Error ﬁelds

are generally unavoidable, and in some cases such ﬁelds can be applied purposefully, as

discussed below. RFA can lead to error ﬁeld penetration (EFP) (EFP)[3–6, 20, 21] or

locking. The accepted view is that EFP involves locking the plasma rotation to just above

zero velocity in response to the error ﬁeld. If this occurs it can cause a loss of the beneﬁt of

sheared rotation on plasma stability, and on occasions can lead to disruptions in tokamaks.

It is well known that RFA occurs by means of coupling to a stable tearing mode, and that

the response is maximized when the tearing mode is near marginal stability[3–5, 7, 20, 21].
The dispersion relation for a spontaneous mode (with ˜ψ(rw) = 0) is ∆(γd) = ∆(cid:48), where
γd is the growth rate γ + ikv in the plasma frame and ∆(cid:48) and ∆ are the usual constant-ψ

matching parameters from the tearing mode outer and inner regions, respectively. Here, v

is the toroidal plasma velocity (E × B plus parallel velocity) at the mode rational surface.

The steady-state magnetic perturbation at the edge of the tearing layer at the mode rational

surface (k|| = 0) is called the reconnected ﬂux in the context of the constant-ψ approximation,

and is known to have the form

˜ψ(rt) = −

l21
∆(cid:48) − ∆(ikv)

˜ψ(rw).

(1)

Here, ˜ψ(rw) is the amplitude of the error ﬁeld applied at the wall, rt is the radius of the mode
rational surface, and l21 is an inductance coeﬃcient. We describe the results here in terms

of large aspect ratio cylindrical geometry, although one toroidal eﬀect, namely favorable

average curvature for safety factor q > 1, is of importance and is included. The quantities

∆, ∆(cid:48) and l21 are normalized so that the plasma radius is equal to unity.

For tearing modes in the viscoresistive (VR) regime[8, 9], with resistivity η and ion

viscosity µ, ∆(γ) has the form

∆(γ) =

µ1/6
|||1/3B1/3 ∆sγ = γτvr,

η5/6|k(cid:48)

(2)

where ∆s is a dimensionless positive constant of order unity. From Eq. (2) it is seen that

spontaneous VR tearing modes have real γ for all ∆(cid:48) and Eq. (1) shows that the largest
response to ˜ψ(rw) for stable plasmas is near marginal stability, where |∆(cid:48)−ikvτvr| is smallest.
This occurs for ∆(cid:48) → 0− with −ωr + kv = 0, i.e. v = 0.

The toroidal torque on the plasma, which comes from the Maxwell stress in the non-ideal

layer, takes the quasilinear form[3, 4]

Nm = −

| ˜ψ(rt)|2Im∆(ikv).

(3)

(This quantity is the integral over the tearing layer of ˜j||

˜Br and is formally a force in this
reduced model. In a tokamak, because of strong damping of the poloidal ﬂow, the toroidal

force component is most important, which gets multiplied by the factor rt/q(rt)R, where q is

the safety factor and R is the toroidal major radius. Thus there is a direct relation between

Nm and torque along the tokamak symmetry axis from toroidal force.) Using Eq. (1) it is

readily seen that this torque in the VR regime is

behaving as −v/(v2
vr, and symmetry about v = 0,
Nm(−v) = −Nm(v). The quantities | ˜ψ(rt)|2 and Nm as a function of ˆv ≡ kvτvr are shown
in Fig. 1, illustrating the behavior around v = 0.

Based on these results, it has been shown[3–5, 7] that models with a viscous response

torque at the layer Nv = N0(v0 − v) (where N0 represents a balance between the momentum

source and viscous drag, with no error ﬁeld to give an equilibrium ﬂow v0) can have three
rotation states, intersections with Nm + Nd = 0, for intermediate values of | ˜ψ(rw)|, as shown
in Fig. 1b. The bifurcation diagram illustrating these states is shown in Fig. 2. The fastest is

the rapidly rotating or high slip state, and the slowest is the penetrated or locked state. The
middle intersection represents an unstable or forbidden rotation. For small | ˜ψ(rw)| or large
N0 (or large v0), only the rapidly rotating state exists; for increasing | ˜ψ(rw)| or decreasing
N0 there is a bifurcation at ˜ψw1 past which the locked and intermediate states can exist.
For further increasing | ˜ψw(rw)| or decreasing N0, there is a bifurcation at ˜ψw2 past which
the two upper states coalesce and only the locked state can exist. Since ˜ψw2 > ˜ψw1, these
bifurcations have hysteresis[3, 4, 10, 11, 20].

gradient p(cid:48)(rt) and ﬁeld line curvature at the tearing layer, parallel dynamics, perpendicular

compression and particle transport, it is known that for suﬃciently high plasma β this is

modiﬁed to give[8, 12]

where A and B ∝ Ds are constant and Ds = −2rp(cid:48)/B2

θ R2q(cid:48)2 is the Suydam parameter. For
Ds > 0 (B > 0), this result leads to the observation that tearing modes are destabilized for all
values of ∆(cid:48) [8, 12], becoming electrostatic with γ ∼ (Ds/∆(cid:48))4 as ∆(cid:48) → −∞ [12]. In toroidal
θ R2q(cid:48)2 = (1 − q2)Ds,
geometry Ds is replaced by the Mercier parameter D = −2rp(cid:48)(1 − q2)/B2
giving B < 0. Again, q is the safety factor and R is the toroidal major radius. The 1 − q2

factor is due to the average curvature in toroidal geometry and leads to D < 0 for q(rt) > 1
and p(cid:48)(rt) < 0.

For favorable curvature D < 0 the dispersion relation ∆(γ) = ∆(cid:48) gives two real roots

with γ > 0 for ∆(cid:48) > ∆min ∝ |D|5/6. For ∆(cid:48) < ∆min, there are complex conjugate roots
with γ = γr ∓ iωr in the plasma frame; these roots have γr < 0 (are stable) if ∆(cid:48) < ∆c; the
quantity ∆c is also proportional to |D|5/6.[1, 2]

The possibility of complex conjugate roots (roots for the spontaneous modes with real
frequency) near marginal stability γr (cid:46) 0 or ∆(cid:48) (cid:46) ∆c, leads to the main result in this paper.

The reconnected ﬂux from Eq. (1) satisﬁes

The denominators |∆(cid:48) − ∆(ikv)|2 are minimized (| ˜ψ(rt)|2 is maximized) when the roots γ
corresponding to the spontaneous mode, with ∆(cid:48) = ∆(γd), are closest to zero in the complex

plane. This occurs when ±ωr + kv is closest to zero, i.e. the frequency of the backward

wave in the lab frame −ωr + kv is zero. See Fig. 3. This allows maximum interaction with

the zero frequency error ﬁeld. Note that at this point ∆i(ikv) is approximately zero so, by

Eq. (7), Nm is very close to zero where v = ωr/k.

FIG. 3. Sketch of the locus of roots in the RI regime with favorable curvature. The blue arrows

indicate the change in the roots as ˆv increases, with the backward wave complex frequency coming

closest to zero for v = ωr/k.

The quantities | ˜ψ(rt)|2 and Nm are shown in Fig. 4, the latter with the viscous torque
Nv(v). Note that the reconnected ﬂux is peaked away from v = 0, approximately where
v = ωr/k. Note also that Nm increases rapidly for v (cid:38) ωr/k, so that the error ﬁelds tend

to lock the plasma to just above the phase velocity of the tearing mode ωr/k, as shown in

Fig. 4, rather than to just above zero plasma velocity as in Fig. 1. This eﬀect produces a

positive asymptotic value of plasma rotation v → ωr/k for the locked state as boundary

ﬁeld is increased, as shown in Fig. 5. The upper line shows three equilibria, but with the
leftmost intersection having v (cid:38) ωr/k rather than v (cid:38) 0. For spontaneous modes which

are very weakly damped and have appreciable phase velocities, the locked state can have

signiﬁcant plasma rotation. Also note that the intersection with the lower line also indicates
three equilibria, but with two negative values of v, and one with v (cid:38) ωr/k. All of these

locked states with ﬁnite velocity exist in spite of the fact that the magnetic ﬁeld driven by

the error ﬁeld is steady, i.e. locked to the error ﬁeld. This eﬀect is related to the fact that

for RI (but not VR) resistive wall tearing modes, small rotation can destabilize the modes

by maximizing the coupling of the tearing modes to the resistive wall[13], even for Ds = 0.

We have formulated the inner layer equations in the RI regime with p(cid:48), curvature and par-

allel dynamics, but ignoring perpendicular compression and perpendicular particle transport,

in order to determine the importance of the last two eﬀects on the stability and propagation

sound speed (G0/b2

This with Eq. (9) shows the form of Refs. [1, 2], namely ∆(Q) = AQ5/4 − BQ−1/4, where

B ∝ G0 ∝ Ds. The unfavorable curvature (G0 > 0) results of Ref. [12] are recovered. In
particular, these results show that Q ∼ (G0/|∆(cid:48)|)4 as ∆(cid:48) → −∞.

The ﬁt in Eq. (10) works well in the favorable curvature case (G0 < 0) also, again for

suﬃciently large sound speed (small |G0/b2

0|.) Unlike in the unfavorable curvature case,
there is no evidence of unstable electrostatic resistive interchanges. That is, these modes

have complex Q and do not show up as poles in ∆(Q) on or near the real axis. These results

8

for favorable curvature show that the behavior observed in Refs. [1, 2] holds qualitatively

using only parallel dynamics, without including the divergence of the E × B drift and

perpendicular particle transport. In particular, there are complex roots for ∆(cid:48) < ∆min =
min(∆(Q)) ∼ |G0|5/6 and these roots become stable for ∆(cid:48) < ∆crit ∼ |G0|5/6. The locus of

roots is shown in Fig. 3.

The quantities | ˜ψ(rt)|2, −Nm and Nd as functions of the plasma rotation rate v shown in
Fig. 4 for ∆(cid:48) (cid:46) ∆c can be compared with those in Fig. 1. For such values of ∆(cid:48) the mode

is weakly stable and the torque is peaked just to the right of v = ωr/k, and negative to the

left of this rotation value. The slope of Nm(v) is steep near v = ωr/k, so the locked state is

just to the right of the phase velocity. As in the VR case in Fig. 1 (with ωr = 0), there can

be two other roots, the rapidly rotating state and an unstable middle root.

It is instructive to consider the case with p(cid:48)(rt) = 0 (G0 = 0) in the RI regime. As
shown in Fig. 6, the reconnected ﬂux | ˜ψ(rt)|2 in the RI regime with and ∆(cid:48) (cid:46) 0 also has two
peaks at kvτri (cid:54)= 0, corresponding to stable complex conjugate roots with Q ∼ |∆(cid:48)|4/5e±4πi/5.

However, the torque curve is not qualitatively diﬀerent from the VR curve in Fig. 1 for zero

pressure gradient, since Nm ∼ −Im(ikv)5/4 = −sgn(kv)|kv|5/4 sin(5π/8), which goes to zero

only at v = 0. It can easily be seen that the simple form for the VR regime (without pressure

gradient) Nm ∼ −v/(v2

1 + v2)( as in Refs. [3–5, 7]) does not hold quantitatively.

b = b0.

Equation (11) has the symmetry G0 → λG0, b0 → λb0, Q → λQ, so the invariants are

G0/b0 and G0/Q. Notice that this symmetry extends to λ < 0, i.e. Q → −Q, G0 → −G0

(and trivially to b0 → −b0.) The quantity ∆s is unchanged, but ∆(Q) → −∆(Q). Thus the

results for unfavorable curvature (G0 > 0) can be applied directly to the favorable curvature

(G0 < 0) case.

We will describe the results ﬁrst in terms of favorable curvature (G0 < 0). For large

values of |G0/b0| ∼ |p(cid:48)|/

leaving a nonmonotonic ∆(Q) curve as shown in Fig. 7. This curve is nonmonotonic for the

the maximum, there are complex roots. A plot of the locus of these roots is shown in Fig. 8.

We obtain a reconnected ﬂux curve and a torque curve shown in Fig. 9, similar curves to

those of in Fig. 4, for the RI regime. (The example in the VR regime in Fig. 9 is for a much

more weakly damped mode, leading to more peaked functions.)

For unfavorable curvature (G0 > 0), the symmetry G0 → −G0, Q → −Q shows that

similar complex roots occur, but they are weakly growing when the roots for G0 > 0 are

weakly damped.

the intersection at the lower positive ˆv, the locked state, again has ˆv (cid:38) ωrτvr rather than ˆv (cid:38) 0.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Our major new result relates to the torque Nm on the plasma as a function of velocity

v for tearing mode regimes with real frequencies, such as the resistive-inertial (RI) regime

with the Glasser eﬀect. We ﬁnd that Nm(v), which is concentrated in the tearing layer of

the driven mode, is exactly zero where v = ωr/k. This torque Nm(v) is peaked just to

right of v = ωr/k, as shown in Figs. 4 and 9. If we model the viscous torque driving the

plasma rotation as Nv = N0(v0 − v), then we ﬁnd that an error ﬁeld can cause locking to
a plasma velocity v with v (cid:38) ωr/k. Thus, the magnetic perturbation locks to the error

ﬁeld at rest in the laboratory frame, but the plasma locks to a velocity just above the ﬁnite
phase velocity v (cid:38) ωr/k of the spontaneous tearing mode. Further, our results show that
the plasma velocity asymptotes to this phase velocity as ˜ψ(rw) → ∞ or N0 → 0.

12

(a)(b)We have also shown that in the VR regime with pressure gradient and parallel dynamics

in the tearing layers, there is a realistic and wide range of parameters for which weakly

stable tearing modes with complex ω ≈ ±ωr + iγ can occur. That is, there is a Glasser

eﬀect in the VR regime as well as in the RI regime[1, 2].

In both regimes, the presence

of real frequencies ωr in the plasma frame implies that the driven tearing mode has a very

peaked maximum amplitude where the plasma velocity v equals the phase velocity ωr/k.

Tearing modes in the presence of diamagnetic eﬀects can also have real frequencies ωr ∝

ω∗, with a reduction in growth rate γ [14–17]. It is expected that diamagnetic propagation
will cause a similar locking of a plasma to a rotating state, v (cid:38) ωr/k. For such modes,

however, there will be no v → −v symmetry because the modes do not occur in complex

conjugate pairs.

For suﬃciently large error ﬁelds, the mode amplitude in the locked state can be high

enough to be in the Rutherford regime[18], where the magnetic island width w is compa-

rable to the tearing layer thickness.

In such cases, the linear theory for the mode (and

quasilinear theory for the torque) should still be qualitatively accurate. For reasonable

DIII-D parameters with moderate plasma rotation, we ﬁnd that the locking threshold is

suﬃciently small that the tearing mode amplitude is below or comparable to that for the

Rutherford regime, so that the above conclusions are valid.

At even higher error ﬁeld amplitudes, sound wave propagation can ﬂatten the pressure

around the island[19] and this weakens the mode propagation. For DIII-D parameters with

fast rotation, the locking threshold is for a large error ﬁeld, so that typically the plasma will

not lock. However, in the presence of such a large error ﬁeld, locking by a necessarily large

error ﬁeld can lead to the formation of a quite large island, and the ﬁnite frequency eﬀects

discussed in this paper, due to pressure gradient, may not be present.

We have one caveat about the linear tearing mode regimes and the nonlinear regimes

discussed above. These are useful for guidance but, for example, when analyzing modes in

the VR regime, the mode may move into another regime as the velocity increases. Also, the

correct regime may be diﬀerent for the locked and unlocked states in the same bifurcation

diagram.

These results provide a new viewpoint on the locking phenomenon: the locking force by

itself leads to a plasma velocity equal to the phase velocity of the spontaneous mode. (The

actual velocity of the plasma must be calculated using a balance the other torques, a mo-

13

mentum source due to neutral beams.) As an example of an application of this framework,

our results suggest the possibility of applying error ﬁelds with a spread in Fourier spectrum.

Then locking may occur in each tearing layer to just above the phase velocity for its Fourier

harmonic. If these phase velocities are not equal, then viscosity (e.g. NTV) should lead to a

sheared rotation between these mode rational surfaces. This possibility might be useful for

maintaining ﬂow shear to help stabilize other modes.
