Kinematic structure of the atmosphere and envelope of the
post-AGB star HD 56126

Special Astrophysical Observatory RAS, Nizhnij Arkhyz, Russia

October 29, 2018

Abstract We present results of an analysis of the optical spectrum of the post-AGB star
HD 56126 (IRAS 07134 + 1005) based on observations made with the echelle spectrographs of
the 6-m telescope with spectral resolutions of R = 25000 and 60000 at 4012–8790 ˚A. The proﬁles
of strongest lines (HI; FeII, YII, BaII absorptions, etc.) formed in the expanding atmosphere at
the base of the stellar wind have complex and variable shapes. To study the kinematics of the
atmosphere, the velocities of individual features in these proﬁles must be measured. Diﬀerential
line shifts of up to Vr = 15÷30 km/s have been detected from the lines of metals and molecu-
lar features. The star’s atmosphere simultaneously contains both expanding layers and layers
falling onto the star. A comparison of the data for diﬀerent times demonstrates that both the
radial velocity and the velocity pattern in whole are variable. The position of the molecular
spectrum is stable, implying stability of the expansion velocity of the circumstellar envelope
around HD 56126 detected in observations in the C2 and NaI lines.

1. Introduction

We studied the kinematic parameters of the atmosphere of the star HD 56126 (SAO 96709), which
belongs to the asymptotic giant branch (the post-AGB stage). In this short evolution stage, stars
are in the process of their transition from the AGB to becoming a planetary nebula; for this reason,
they are generally known as proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe). In the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram,
post-AGB stars evolve toward the left from the AGB, maintaining nearly constant luminosity while
becoming hotter. As descendants of AGB stars, these objects can be used to trace variations in the
physical conditions and chemical parameters of the stellar material due to changes in the sources
of energy release in the stellar interior, the ejection of the envelope, and mixing.

HD 56126 is the optical component of the IR source IRAS 07134+1005, which has a double
peaked spectral energy distribution (SED), typical for PPNe. In addition to this anomalous SED,
associated with the circumstellar dust envelope, the star also displays other characteristics of this
type of object [1]: the optical component of the PPN is a F5 Iab supergiant outside the galactic
plane (b=+9.m99); the central star is surrounded by an extended nebula whose angular size exceeds
′′
4
, according to Hubble Space Telescope observations [2] (the largest known for this type of PPN);
and the optical spectrum displays Hα emission and absorption with a variable line proﬁle [3]. In
addition to these general PPN characteristics noted by Kwok [1], subsequent studies of HD 56126
and the associated IR source revealed several important peculiarities expected for this evolution
stage: a large excess of carbon and s-process elements [4] and an emission feature at λ = 21 µ in the
IR–spectrum.

In the small subgroup of PPN having this emission, the presence of this 21 µ feature was found to
correlate with observational manifestations of the products of nucleosynthesis (the excess of carbon

and heavy metals in the outer layers of the atmosphere) [5, 6]. Thus, HD 56126 displays all the
properties ex pected for a post-AGB object, indicating the importance of detailed studies of its
optical spectrum with high spectral resolution in a broad wavelength range. Fortunately, HD 56126
is fairly bright (B = 9.m11, V = 8.27m), making it the most convenient carbon enriched PPN star
for high resolution spectroscopy.

The main moments of our study are spectral features identiﬁcation and comparison the spectra
of HD 56126 and the standard α Per (Sp = F5 Iab); search for proﬁle variability for spectral features;
analyses the radial velocities Vr to search for diﬀerential shifts; and studying the variability of the
radial velocity. In Section 2, we brieﬂy describe the techniques used for the observations, processing,
and analysis of the spectral data. The main conclusions concerning the spectrum of the star are
presented in Section 3.1, while Sections 3.2 and 3.3 present our radial velocity measurements derived
using various features of the spectrum, and discuss the temporal behavior of the radial-velocity
pattern. Our results are summarized in Section 4.

2. Observations and reduction of the spectra

We observed HD 56126 and α Per with the 6-meter telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory. All the spectra were obtained at the Nasmyth focus with the NES [7, 8] and Lynx
[9, 10] echelle spectrographs. In combination with a 2048×2048 CCD and the image cutter [11],
NES provides a spectral resolution of R = 60000. The Lynx spectrograph used with a 1K×1K CCD
yields R = 25000. The Table presents the observing dates and wavelength regions detected. The
spectral data were extracted from two-dimension echelle-spectra using the ECHELLE context in
the MIDAS package modiﬁed to take into account speciﬁc features of the echelle frames obtained
with these spectrographs (see [12] for details). Cosmic-ray traces were removed via median averag-
ing of pairs of consecutive spectra. The wavelength calibtration was carried out using spectra of a
hollow cathode Th-Ar lamp.

The further processing, including photometric and position measurements, was performed using
the DECH20 code [13], which makes it possible to ﬁnd the positions of spectral features by overlap-
ping their direct and mirrored proﬁles. To increase the accuracy of the radial-velocity measurement,
the least blended lines in the observed and corresponding synthetic spectra were compared.

In each spectrogram, the positional zero point was determined in the standard way, via calibration
using the positions of ionospheric night-sky emission lines and telluric absorptions in the star
spectrum. The accuracy of the velocity measured from one line in the spectra obtained with the
NES and Lynx spectrographs is about 1.0 and 1.5 km/s, respectively.

Interstellar features. Comparing our data with those obtained by other authors, we tested the
coincidence of the radial-velocity zero points using interstellar and circumstellar lines. Figure 1
presents the D2 NaI line proﬁles; both here and in the Table, to display the ﬁne structure of the
lines, we consider only spectra obtained with our maximum resolution, R = 60000. As a result, ﬁve
components of the D2 NaI line can be distinguished. Three blue-shifted interstellar components of
the D2 line in the spectrum of HD 56126, clearly seen in Fig. 1, yield the same Vr values within
the errors (columns 10–12 in the Table, with the averaged values Vr = 12.6, 23.6, and 30.9 km/s).
The stability of these values conﬁrms that these three components are formed in the interstellar
medium. The shift of the component of the D2 NaI line with Vr = 75.8 km/s is consistent with that
of the Swan bands of the C2 molecule (columns (8) and (9) of the Table), which indicates that
this component is formed in the circumstellar medium. It is obvious that the longest-wavelength
component, Vr = 88.5 km/s, is photospheric: its temporal behavior corresponds to that of other
photospheric absorption features. Note that such a structure of the D NaI lines is consistent with the
results obtained by Bakker et al. [14], who distinguished a weak component of the D2 NaI line with
< Vr > = 44 km/s, which is also seen in at least three of our spectra, yielding < Vr > = 46±1 km/s.
In addition, as we can see from Fig. 1, the blend of three blue-shifted components displays sharp
boundaries, making it possible to reliably measure the velocity for the blend as a whole. The average
value derived from our data, Vr = 20.3±0.3 km/s, coincides with that obtained by L’ebre et al. [16]
from spectra with lower resolution: Vr = 20±2 km/s.

As was shown by Crawford and Barlow [15], when the C2 and KI circumstellar features are
observed with ultra-high resolution, they split into components spaced at about 1 km/s. These
components yield the same set of velocities, but display diﬀerent relative intensities. This may
result in small systematic diﬀerences (also of the order of 1 km/s) in the velocities obtained for the
atomic and molecular circumstellar lines at lower resolution. Our measurements do not indicate
variations in these velocities, while the average values 77.2±0.5 km/s for C2 and 75.4±0.3 km/s
for NaI do not disagree systematically with those obtained by L’ebre et al. [16], Bakker et al.
[14, 17], and Crawford and Barlow [15]: 77.3÷77.6 km/s and 75.3÷76.8 km/s for C2 and NaI, KI,
respectively.

Hα line in the spectrum of HD 56126. The Hα lines in the spectra of typical PPNe display complex
(emission + absorption) variable proﬁles with asymmetrical core, P Cygni type proﬁles of various
kinds from direct to inverted, proﬁles with asymmetrical emission wings, or proﬁles containing two
emission components. A combination of such features is also frequently observed. As we can see from
Fig. 2, the Hα line in the spectrum of HD 56126 has both absorption and emission components,
which are not seen in the spectrum of the normal supergiant α Per. Figure 2 also clearly shows
the Hα absorption wings, extending to values close to those for the Hα wings in the spectrum of
α Per. Figure 3, which presents only the central parts of the Hα proﬁles for all our observations,
demonstrates the proﬁle variability from night to night.

Previously, based on their spectral monitoring of HD 56126, Oudmaijer and Bakker [3] concluded
that the Hα proﬁle is strongly variable on timescales of two months. The analysis of the variability of
the Hα proﬁle and the corresponding set of radial velocities using Fourier methods led L’ebre et al.
[16] to conclude that there are complex, pulsation-driven, dynamical conditions in the atmosphere
of HD 56126. The extensive set of high-quality spectral observations of HD 56126 over almost eight
years of Barth’es et al. [18] indicated that, apart from Hα, the Hβ line also varies. Analyzing
the proﬁle variability of both these hydrogen lines, these authors concluded that the observed
variability does not display any periodicity that could be related to variations of the radial velocity
and brightness of the star.

Swan bands. In addition to speciﬁc features of the HI line proﬁles, the peculiarity of PPNe optical
spectra is also manifest in the presence of numerous molecular absorption features, along with lines
characteristic of F–K supergiants. In the spectrum of HD 56126, with an eﬀective temperature
Teﬀ = 7000 K [4], the C2 Swan absorption band system is observed, as well as the red CN system,
ﬁrst identiﬁed by Bakker et al. [14]. Later, molecular bands in the spectra of PPNe in another
sample (including HD 56126), selected for the presence of the carbon-containing molecules C2, CN,
and CH+ in their envelopes, were studied in detail by Bakker et al. [17] using high-resolution spectra
(R = 50000). Judging from the velocity corresponding to the position of these bands, the absorption
molecular spectrum is formed in a restricted region of the envelope, close to the star [17].

Our spectra of HD 56126 contain several Swan bands. Figure 4 shows a spectral fragment
with the head of the C2 (0;0) band at 5165 ˚A, and compares again the spectra of HD 56126
and the normal supergiant α Per. We present a detailed list of Swan band spectral
fea-
tures in the spectrum of HD 56126 and their intensities and corresponding radial velocities at
http://www.sao.ru/hq/ssl/HD56126-Atlas/ Atlas.html. The radial velocities derived from the Swan
bands are analyzed in Section 3.2. Although Swan bands have been detected in emission in the spec-
tra of several PPNe [5, 17], no signs of emission in these bands or in the D lines of NaI have been
found in spectra of HD 56126 obtained in various years. This is consistent with the fairly simple
elliptical shape of the nebula surrounding HD 56126.

Apparently, emission in the Swan bands or the D lines of NaI is observed only in the spectra
of PPNe with bright circumstellar nebulae displaying pronounced asymmetry. This is conﬁrmed
by the spectroscopic results for IRAS 04296+3429 [19], IRAS 23304+6147 [20], AFGL 2688 [21],
IRAS 08005−2356 [22], IRAS 20056+1834 [23, 24], and IRAS 20508+2011 [25]. As a rule, the HST
images of these PPNe [2] display bipolar structure. We emphasize that most of these objects
belong to Type 1 (PPNe with polarized optical radiation) according to the classiﬁcation suggested
by Trammell et al. [26].

Based on the parameters of the PPNe whose spectra we have studied, including HD 56126, we
suggest that emission in the Swan bands and/or NaI D lines is observed in the spectra of PPNe
(and related stars with envelopes) in which the outward propagation of the radiation of the central
star is substantially hindered by absorption in the circumstellar dust envelope. Proﬁles of metal
lines. Figures 5 and 6 show that the proﬁles of strong lines of metals in the spectrum of HD 56126
are not symmetrical. In addition, comparisons of spectra obtained on diﬀerent nights indicate that,
for the metallic lines formed in the expanding atmosphere of the star (at the base of the wind), the
proﬁle shape varies with both time and line intensity. Parthasarathy et al. [27] had already noted
the asymmetry of the BaII 6141 ˚A line proﬁle in the HD 56126 spectrum. It cannot be ruled out
that the variability of the proﬁles is due to splitting of the absorption lines into components whose
positions and intensities are diﬀerent at diﬀerent times. High-spectral-resolution observations reveal
the multicomponent structure of metal lines in the spectra of various types of variable stars, such
as classical Cepheids (see, for example, [28]) or pulsating RV Tau [29] or W Vir type [30] stars, due
to the presence of shocks (see also references below). The possibility for several shocks to coexist in
the atmosphere of HD 56126 was shown by Barth’es et al. [18]. However, direct observation of the

splitting of metal lines in the spectrum of HD 56126 is complicated by broadening in the turbulent
atmosphere of the supergiant.

3.2. Variability of the radial velocity pattern

Some of PPNe display variability of the radial velocity Vr with characteristic timescales of sev-
eral hundred days, possibly providing evidence for binarity. Indeed, conclusive evidence for orbital
motion has been obtained for several optically bright objects with IR–excesses. For example, the
binarity of the high-lattitude supergiants 89 Her [31, 32] and HR 4049 [33] has been proven, the
corresponding orbit elements determined, and models of the systems proposed. Van Winckel et al.
[34] showed that HR 4049, HD 44179, and HD 52961 are spectral binaries with orbital periods of
about one to two years. Bakker et al. [35] studied the variability of complex emission–absorption
proﬁles of the NaI D lines and Hα for HR 4049 as functions of the orbital period using high resolu-
tion spectra. The individual components of these lines are formed either in the atmosphere of the
primary, in the disk in which both binary components are submerged, or in the interstellar medium.
The nature of the companions in suspected post-AGB binaries is still unknown, since there are no
directly manifestations of their radiation in either the continuum or in spectral lines: all known
post-AGB binaries are of type SB1. The companions could be very hot or very low luminosity main
sequence objects; white dwarfs cannot be ruled out either, as in the case of BaII stars. The Vr
variability in PPNe can also be complicated by diﬀerential motions in their extended atmospheres.
A detailed analysis of Vr for selected bright PPNe using spectra with high spectral and temporal
resolution reveals diﬀerences in the behavior of Vr determined from lines with diﬀerent degrees of
excitation, formed at diﬀerent depths in the stellar atmosphere.

In the following Section, we point out such diﬀerences in the behavior of Vr for HD 56126.
Variability of the radial velocity of HD 56126 was ﬁrst suspected in [4], based on a comparison of
published data with new data obtained on the 6-m telescope. In subsequent years, several authors
studied this variability using high resolution spectroscopy. Oudmaijer and Bakker [14] used a very
large collection of spectrograms with high time resolution and high S/N ratio, and concluded that
there was Vr variability on timescales of several months in the interval Vr = (84÷87)±2 km/s, with
an absence of variations with characterisctic timescales from minutes to hours.

L’ebre et al. [16] carried out detailed spectral monitoring of HD 56126. Applying a Fourier analysis
to radial-velocity data together with data for the brightness variability, they concluded that the
dynamical state of the atmosphere of HD 56126 and the pattern inherent to pulsating RV Tau
variables were similar. They interpreted the Hα variability as a result of shocks. Later, L’ebre et
al. [36] studied the variability of the Hα and Hβ lines. Having augmented the spectral data and
used also photometric observations, they determined the period of radial pulsations to be P = 36.d8.
Barth’es et al. [18] collected all reliable Vr measurements for HD 56126 (89 values obtained over eight
years) and analyzed them with photometric data, revealing the presence of Vr variability with a half-
amplitude of 2.7 km/s and the primary period P = 36.8±0.d2. The photometric variability displays
the same period, with a very low amplitude (0.m02). They concluded that the star’s variability
diﬀers substantially from the pulsations observed in RV Tau stars. With its fairly high temperature,
HD 56126 has evolved further than the RV Tau stage. The variability of the brightness and radial
velocity of HD 56126 may be due to ﬁrst-overtone radial pulsations caused by shocks that generate
complex, asynchronous motions in the upper hydrogen-rich layers of the star.

Our new Vr data for HD 56126 are summarized in the Table. Taking into account the large
probability of diﬀerential shifts in the outer layers of the stellar atmosphere, we present here Vr
values for individual lines and groups of lines. As we can see, the velocity variations are real, even
when they are detected for weak absorption lines (Rλ →0). The positions of circumstellar features
(the NaI D line and C2 Swan band; see columns 8 and 9 of the Table) display good consistency.
Their comparison with the data from column (4) yields an expansion velocity for the envelope

Vexp ≈ 11 km/s. Note that the position of the primary Hα component is not always consistent with
the positions of the D NaI lines and Swan band, whereas the behavior of the Hβ line is synchronized
with the FeII(42) line. There are still no suﬃcient reasons to consider HD 56126 a binary; however,
this cannot be conclusively ruled out, either. In this connection, it is worth noting the remark
made by Barth’es et al. [18] concerning the weak trend of the star’s radial velocity during their
long-term observations. This trend may provide evidence for the presence of a second component
in the system, with the orbital period exceeding 16 years. Our eight spectra, obtained at later
dates, cannot clarify this situation. The variability of the velocities derived from extremely weak
absorption lines, Vr(Rλ →0), may indicate binarity of the star, but it may also be a manifestation
of low-amplitude pulsations in circum-photospheric layers. Resolving the question of binarity for
HD 56126 requires that the behavior of Vr be followed over several years, with one or two spectra
obtained regularly each month.

3.3. Asymmetry of the proﬁles and diﬀerential shifts of the lines

When comparing our Vr values with those from other studies, we should bear in mind not only the
diﬀerent methods used, but also the spectroscopic peculiarity of the object, and the asymmetries
of lines in the spectrum of HD 56126 (Figs. 5 and 6). The line proﬁle shapes vary with both time
and line intensity. Therefore, we will consider separately the data for the line cores in columns 4–8
of the Table (i.e., the lower parts of the absorption lines or the absorption components of the Hα
proﬁles; or sometimes, in the case of line splitting, individual components), and supplement these
with the Vr estimates derived from the upper parts and edges of the proﬁles.

The large spectral interval recorded with the echelle spectrograph made it possible to study the
diﬀerential radial-velocity patterns measured from lines with diﬀerent intensities. For each of our
spectra, we constructed the dependence Vr(R) of the heliocentric radial velocity Vr measured in
the absorption core on its central depth R. Figure 7 shows some of these dependences characteristic
of HD 56126. The velocity of the center of mass of the star Vsys = 86.1 km/s [37] obtained from CO
observations at millimeter wavelengths is marked by the horizontal dashed lines.

Most of the points in these graphs are conﬁned within narrow, almost horizontal bands, in
which the vertical scatter is determined by the uncertainties for individual lines. The right ends of
the bands, corresponding to the strongest lines formed in the outer layers of the atmosphere, are
sometimes turned upwards or downwards. For α Per, the Vr(R) dependences are strictly horizontal
over the total interval of line depths. When the C2 molecular lines of HD 56126 appear in the
studied spectral interval, the corresponding points also form short strips below the main bands,
always at the same Vr level of about 77 km/s, as was noted above. In contrast, points corresponding
to lines of atoms and ions can occur at, above, or below the level of Vsys (Fig. 7). Column 4 of the
Table contains the average Vr values for the left edges of the main bands; i.e., the limiting values to
which they tend when the central absorption intensities approach the continuum level (their depths
Rλ →0).

Obviously, these can be considered the deepest layers of the atmosphere accessible to observations.
Radial velocities derived from moderate-intensity absorption lines in the spectrum of HD 56126 are
presented by L’ebre et al. [16] and Barth’es et al. [18]. These values were obtained from only
two lines, BaII 5854 and CI 6588 ˚A, but for several dozen observing epochs; the total range of
variation of Vr is 81÷93 km/s. Both of these lines lie on almost horizontal sections of our Vr(R)
dependences, to the left of the sharp breaks at R≈60 (Fig. 7c). The Vr values measured from
our eight spectra that contain at least one of these two lines vary from 84 to 91 km/s, within the
interval obtained by Barth’es et al. [18]. As we can see from Column 4 of the Table, the limits for the
variations of the average velocities derived from the weakest absorption lines are somewhat lower:
82.5 km/s< Vr(Rλ → 0)<89.8 km/s (±4 km/s relative to Vsys). The average values of our Vr(Rλ →
0) and for the two lines analyzed in [18] coincide within the errors (87.3±0.7 and 87.7±0.3 km/s).

Klochkova & Chentsov: HD 56126: structure of the atmosphere and envelope

7

The Vr values obtained from the stellar components of the NaI D lines (column 8 of the Table, the
value in parentheses) are close to Vr(Rλ →0), but less accurate.

Strong SrII and YII lines and other strong lines (with depths Rλ ≈ 60 − 70; points on the Vr(R)
dependences to the left of the breaks) display largeamplitude time variations and a predominance of
red shifts relative to the weakest absorption lines: 83 < Vr < 94 km/s (−3 km/s, +8 km/s relative to
Vsys). Both of these tendencies are even more pronounced in the FeII(42) and Hα lines (columns 5
and 6 of the Table): 77 < Vr < 98 km/s (−9 km/s and +12 km/s relative to Vsys). In three cases,
the velocity could also be estimated from reliably detected blue-shifted components of the FeII(42)
lines. The Hα proﬁle displays the highest variability, but for any proﬁle presented in Fig. 3, an
analogous proﬁle can be found among those presented by L’ebre et al. [16] and Barth’es et al. [18],
in terms of both proﬁle shape and the velocities derived from the absorption components. In our
spectra, Vr(Hα) (column 7 of the Table) varies from 54 to 88 km/s (−32 and +2 km/s, relative to
Vsys) for the main (deeper) components and from 43 to 112 km/s (−43 and +26 km/s relative to
Vsys) for the secondary components.

All the lines except those of hydrogen have the same type of asymmetry: their blue wing is
extended more than the red, i.e., the velocity measured from the upper part of the proﬁle (from the
wings) is smaller than the velocity measured from the core. The blue shift of the wings relative to the
core increases with line strength, either gradually or jump-like. In three of our spectra, obtained on
November 20, 2002, March 9, 2004, and November 12, 2005, the absorption lines remain symmetrical
up to Rλ ≈ 50 (horizontal sections of Vr(R) dependences in Fig. 7), but also display the above
asymmetry for the deepest lines (Figs. 5 and 6). The FeII(42) absorption lines are asymmetrical for
all our observing epochs (Fig. 6); on November 14, 2003 and November 12, 2005, the shift of their
wings relative to their cores reaches −11 km/s. In contrast, in the spectrum obtained on March
4, 1999, the asymmetry is seen even in the weakest lines; in the interval 5 < R < 50, as the lines
deepen and their blue shifts grow, the diﬀerence between the Vr values measured from the wings
and cores increases from −3 to −6 km/s, but the most blue-shifted FeII(42) absorption lines are
again almost symmetrical (Figs. 6 and 7a). The wings of strong lines are less shifted relative to
the weak lines than are their cores, and the velocities derived from the wings are closer to the
center-of-mass velocity of the star (deviations from Vsys are from −10 to +3 km/s). We can see
from Fig. 3 and the ﬁgures presented in [18] that both the blue the red slopes of the Hα absorption
component may be ﬂatter (we are speaking here of the central part of the proﬁle, rather than the
broad photospheric wings).

Strong absorption lines in the spectrum of HD 56126 display fairly clear-cut boundaries, from
which the velocities were also measured. These measurements show that the red boundary of the
proﬁle is substantially more stable than the blue. For the red boundaries of the strongest non-
hydrogen lines, it is suﬃcient to indicate the average velocity, namely Vr = 124±2 km/s, while
the velocity for the left boundaries ranges from 25 to 53 km/s. For Hα, the same estimates
yield Vr = 133±5 km/s and 10÷55 km/s. Thus, the deviations from Vsys are −33 ÷ −61 km/s and
+38±2 km/s in the former and −31 ÷ −76 km/s and +47±5 km/s in the latter case.

Summarising the measurements and analysis of the radial velocity pattern, we draw the following

conclusions.

– Our data for the radial velocities of HD 56126 are fairly accurate (the systematic errors are below
1 km/s), making it possible to combine them with the most accurate data obtained previously.

– We have found substantial diﬀerential shifts for lines of diﬀerent intensities within the same
spectrum (up to 15 km/s for metallic lines, and up to 30 km/s for Hα); these are the Vr(R)
dependences manifesting the Vr gradient. The time variability of the Vr(R) dependences indicates
that velocities should be measured using a large set of lines within an extended spectral interval.

– Both expanding matter and matter falling onto the star are seen in the stellar atmosphere.

– Data for extremely weak absorption lines are important (Vr(R →0)) for studies of the velocity
pattern; the detected variability of these velocities, 82.5< Vr(R → 0) < 89.8 km/s, may either
represent low-amplitude pulsations in the circumphotospheric layers or indicate the star’s bina-
rity.

– We have found complex and variable proﬁles of strongest lines (not only hydrogen, but also FeII,
YII, BaII, and other absorption lines) formed in the expanding stellar atmosphere (at the base
of the wind). Measurements for the velocities derived from individual features of these proﬁles
are needed for kinematic studies.

– We have conﬁrmed the stability of the expansion velocity for the circumstellar envelope of

HD 56126, determined from the C2 and D2 lines of NaI.

– High and ultra-high spectral resolution is needed to study, respectively, stellar and circumstellar

lines in the spectrum of HD 56126 displaying complex structures.

4. Conclusions

Our high resolution spectra of HD 56126 have revealed variability of various line proﬁles: along with
the previously known Hα proﬁle variability, the proﬁles of strongest lines (such as BaII, YII, and
FeII) also proved to be variable. The broad spectral range encompassed by our spectra enabled
us to measure radial velocities using spectral features that form at various depths in the stellar
atmosphere and circumstellar envelope.

We were able to distinguish the C2 absorption molecular bands (and their structure), as well
as bands identiﬁed with diﬀuse interstellar bands. We found substantial diﬀerential shifts in lines
of diﬀerent intensities within the same spectrum, i.e., appreciable Vr(R) dependences, as well as
variation of these shifts with time. This indicates the need for velocity measurements based on a
large set of lines in an extended spectral interval.

We conclude that both expanding layers and matter falling onto the star exist simultaneously in
the stellar atmosphere. The position of the molecular spectrum is stable, indicating stability of the
expansion velocity of the envelope.
