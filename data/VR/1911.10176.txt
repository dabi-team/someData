ABSTRACT

1.1 The Demand for a Standardized Measure

User embodiment is important for many virtual reality (VR) appli-
cations, for example, in the context of social interaction, therapy,
training, or entertainment. However, there is no validated instrument
to empirically measure the perception of embodiment, necessary to
reliably evaluate this important quality of user experience (UX). To
assess components of virtual embodiment in a valid, reliable, and
consistent fashion, we develped a Virtual Embodiment Question-
naire (VEQ). We reviewed previous literature to identify applicable
constructs and items, and performed a conﬁrmatory factor analysis
(CFA) on the data from three experiments (N = 196). Each experi-
ment modiﬁed a distinct simulation property, namely, the level of
immersion, the level of personalization, and the level of behavioral
realism. The analysis conﬁrmed three factors: (1) ownership of a
virtual body, (2) agency over a virtual body, and (3) change in the
perceived body schema. A fourth study (N = 22) further conﬁrmed
the reliability and validity of the scale and investigated the impacts of
latency jitter of avatar movements presented in the simulation com-
pared to linear latencies and a baseline. We present the ﬁnal scale
and further insights from the studies regarding related constructs.

1 INTRODUCTION

User embodiment can be referred to as “the provision of users with
appropriate body images so as to represent them to others (and also
to themselves)” [7, p.242]. With the availability of consumer VR
technology, it became apparent that the relevance of virtual embodi-
ment is not limited to the understanding of cognitive processes. In
addition, understanding virtual embodiment has concrete and direct
implications for research, design, and development. It is especially
relevant for applications that consider therapy [1, 16, 49, 51, 56, 57],
entertainment [34,44,55], as well as collaboration and social interac-
tion [6,36,37,59]. Previous research investigated virtual embodiment
in various studies. However, a consistent and validated instrument
for assessing components of virtual embodiment, to the best of our
knowledge, does not exist.

Previous studies adapted measures from originating experiments
such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI) [11], for example, individual
questionnaires and displacement measures. However, the assessment
of concepts such as virtual body ownership (VBO) is not consistent.
Effects are often assessed with single items, which was argued to be
problematic [15]. Approaches to cross-validating different measures
often failed (see [32, 58] for discussions). According to Boateng et
al. [10], the creation of a rigorous scale undergoes three stages: 1)
In the item development stage, the domain is identiﬁed, and items
are theoretically analyzed regarding their content validity. 2) In the
scale development stage, questions are pre-tested, and hypothesized
factors are explored with covariance analysis (e.g., exploratory factor
analysis), along with a consecutive reduction of items to an item pool
that remains internally consistent, followed by the factor extraction.
In the scale evaluation phase, the dimensionality is tested with CFA,
and consecutively, the reliability (e.g., Cronbach’s alpha) and validity
(i.e., relation to other constructs and measurements) are evaluated.
Gonzalez-Franco and Peck emphasized the request for a standard-
ized questionnaire and review assessments [23]. From those, they
“identify a set of questions to be standardized for future embodiment
experiences” [23, p. 4] which they organized in six experimental
interests (body ownership, agency and motor control, tactile sen-
sations, location of the body, external appearance, and response to
external stimuli). Progressing beyond a theoretical approach, we pro-
pose a scale that is data driven, and proceeded through all stages of
rigorous scale development (see also [10,19]), and is generally appli-
cable to many embodiment experiments. A scale should be reliable
(produce repeatable results within and across subjects irrespective
of the testing conditions), valid (measure the underlying constructs
precisely), sensitive (discriminate between multiple outcome levels),
and objective (shielded from third-party variable bias) [47, 80].

1.2 Contribution

We present the creation of a valid and consistent measurement in-
strument for assessing three components of virtual embodiment
(ownership, agency, and change in perceived body scheme). These
components were explored, conﬁrmed, and validated. We inves-
tigated the scale performance by exploring it’s relation to related
concepts and previous measures applied, and conﬁrm its validity, re-
liability, and sensitivity. We further provide insights into the impacts
of immersion, avatar personalization, behavioral realism, and latency
and latency jitter that were investigated with the experiments. The
questionnaire can be applied to various VR experiments to assess
virtual embodiment.

 
 
 
 
 
 
1.3 Embodiment

Embodiment is a part of self-consciousness and arises through mul-
tisensory information processing [21, 40, 42]. Previous literature
mainly considered three components of embodiment: A conscious
experience of self-identiﬁcation (body ownership), controlling one’s
own body movements (agency) [72], and being located at the posi-
tion of one’s body in an environment (self-location) [39, 42]. Re-
search also stresses the importance of the perspective with which
one perceives the world with (ﬁrst-person perspective) [8, 9].

Body ownership can be described as the experience and alloca-
tion of a bodily self as one’s own body, as “my body,” the particular
perception of one’s own body as the source of bodily sensations,
unique to oneself so that it is present in one’s mental life [20, 71, 72].
A key instrument in investigations of body ownership is the RHI [11].
The experiment stimulates ownership of an artiﬁcial body part in the
form of a rubber hand by simultaneous tactile stimulation (visually
hidden) of the physical hand combined with a parallel visual stimu-
lation of a rubber hand. Caused by the stimulation, participants start
to perceive the rubber hand as part of their body.

Agency, meaning the “experience of oneself as the agent of one’s
own actions - and not of others’ actions” ( [17, p. 523,] following
[20]) relates to body ownership [13,72,73]. Tsakiris, et al. described
agency as “the sense of intending and executing actions, including
the feeling of controlling one’s own body movements, and, through
them, events in the external environment” [72, p. 424].

Previous work showed that bottom-up accounts (multisensory
processing and integration) are an important driver [33, 71], and
that top-down processes (e.g., form and appearance matching) at
least modulate embodiment [13, 24, 72, 73]. Kilteni, et al. [33]
reviewed triggers and preventers of body ownership illusions and
summarized that cross-modal stimulation, for example, congruent
visuomotor and visuotactile stimulation supported ownership illu-
sions. In contrast, incongruencies (thus counter-acting sensorimotor
contingencies) hinder ownership. Further, visuoprorioceptive cues,
such as perspective shifts or modiﬁed distances, as well as semantic
modulations can impact ownership illusions [33].

1.4 Virtual Embodiment

Virtual embodiment was deﬁned as “the physical process that em-
ploys the VR hardware and software to substitute a person’s body
with a virtual one” [67, p.1]. Embodiment has received ongoing
attention in VR research, for example, regarding avatar hand appear-
ance [2, 27, 30, 61] and full body representations [46, 48, 52, 66, 74].
Avatars that represent a user are deﬁned as virtual characters driven
by human behavior [5]. Following video-based approaches [40],
researchers found that the concept of the RHI also applies to virtual
body parts [64], and entire virtual bodies [45, 65, 66].

To investigate and alternate virtual body perception, experimen-
tation has used mirrors in immersive HMD-based simulations [22],
and semi-immersive fake (magic) mirror projections [38, 74]. Ac-
cording to Slater, et al. [65], the induction time for body ownership
illusions varies between about 10 s and 30 min. Kilteni, et al. [32]
summarized ﬁndings and measures regarding self-location, agency,
and body ownership, and argue for a continuous measurement ap-
proach. Similar to Kilteni, et al. [33], Maselli and Slater concluded
from their experiments that bottom-up factors, like sensorimotor
coherence, and a ﬁrst-person perspective, are driving factors [46].
They argue that appearance moderates the experience insofar as
realistic humanoid textures foster body ownership.

An important effect regarding the embodiment through avatars
in VR is the Proteus effect [81, 82]. Yee and Bailenson found a
change in behavior, self-perception and participants’ identity when
taking the perspective of an avatar with altered appearance. Partici-
pants changed their behavior and attitude according to behavior they
attributed to their virtual representation.

In summary, the degree and the precision with which sensory stim-
ulation, appearance, and behavior are rendered, as well as the per-
spective that is presented are important aspects for user-embodying
interfaces [22, 33, 45, 46, 74, 75]. Design choices, for example, the
character type, or the realism of the replicated appearance and behav-
ior may strongly inﬂuence the perceptual phenomena of embodiment.
Measuring embodiment in a valid way, therefore, is crucial to VR
applications.

2 SCALE CONSTRUCTION

Previous assessments often base on the original RHI experiment [11].
A psychometric approach to assessing levels of embodiment toward
an artiﬁcial physical body part identiﬁed the latent variables of
ownership, agency, and location [41]. The assessment of location
included items focusing on the coherence between sensation and
causation, and locational similarities of artiﬁcial physical body parts.
Roth et al. [58] presented a proposal to assess virtual embodiment
with 13 questions from previous work [3, 11, 18, 22, 31, 41, 45, 50,
53, 66, 69]. A principal component analysis revealed three factors:
acceptance (covering the aspect of ownership perception), control
(covering the aspect of agency perception), and change (covering
the aspect of a perceived change in one’s own body schema). The
last factor may be especially important for studies that make use of
altered body appearances and the Proteus effect [58, 81, 82]. The in-
strument showed good reliability in further assessments [37, 74]. In
addition to necessary validation and consistency analysis, two down-
sides can be identiﬁed: 1) The measure is strongly constrained to
“virtual mirror” scenarios due to the phrasing, and 2) the components
are not balanced regarding the number of items. In particular, the
ownership component consists of only three statements. We based
our scale construction on their work and performed necessary im-
provements. Regarding the item development, we ﬁrst generalized
the phrasing of the questions to ﬁt generic scenarios. Second, we
added questions to balance the component assessment for ownership
(“It felt like the virtual body belonged to another person,” - adapted
from [50], “It felt like the virtual body belonged to me”) and agency
factors (“The movements of the virtual body were in sync with my
own movements”), respectively. The items are shown in Table 1.
For the scale development and scale evaluation, CFA was calculated
with the data from three studies (N = 196) that assessed the impacts
of particular manipulations hypothesized to affect embodiment. The
study results are discussed in detail in Section 3.

2.1 Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis

We performed the CFAs using R with the lavaan package. The
reporting of ﬁt indices is based on the recommendation made by
Kline [35]. As the assumption of multivariate normality was vio-
lated, we conducted a robust maximum likelihood estimation and
computed Satorra-Bentler (SB) corrected test statistics (see [14]).
The ﬁrst attempt did not yield an acceptable model ﬁt, and as the
modiﬁcation indices indicated, there were covariations in the error
terms of a particular item loading on several factors (“I had the
illusion of owning a different body from my own”). Therefore, this
item was dropped. A second attempt yielded an acceptable model
ﬁt. However, inspection of the modiﬁcation indices revealed covari-
ations in the error terms of two items loading on several factors (“I
had the feeling that the virtual body belonged to another person,”
“I enjoyed controlling the virtual body”). Thus, we excluded prob-
lematic items. Furthermore, items with a factor loading < .40 were
excluded (“I felt the need to check if my body really still looked like
what I had in mind”). The third CFA with the remaining 16 items
yielded a more parsimonious solution with a good model ﬁt, SB
χ 2 = 52.50, df = 51, p = .416, root mean square error of approx-
imation AC (RMSEA) = .013, 90% conﬁdence interval of robust
root mean square error of approximation [.000; .052], standardized
root mean square residual (SRMR) = .047, and a robust comparative
ﬁt index (CFI) = .998. Thus, the solution was deemed acceptable
to characterize these components of virtual embodiment. Table
2 depicts the standardized coefﬁcients. The reliability values for
ownership (α = .783), agency (α = .764), and change (α = .765)
were acceptable. The resulting scale is depicted in Table 3, its fac-
tors are illustrated in Fig 1. The scale was assessed in german. A
professional service was consulted for the translation.

3 VALIDATION

The validation of the VEQ is based on four studies that explored
individual aspects of virtual embodiment. We manipulated sim-
ulation properties that were hypothesized to affect the perceived
embodiment, namely, immersion (Study 1), personalization (Study
2), behavioral realism (Study 3), simulation latency and latency jitter
(Study 4). To assess the scale validity, we investigated correlations
to related concepts, reliability, and compared the scale performance
to related instruments. Participants were individually recruited (i.e.,
the studies were not performed in block testing fashion) through
the recruitment system of the institute for human-computer-media
at the University of W¨urzburg. All studies were approved by the
ethics committee of the institute for human-computer-media at the
University of W¨urzburg.

3.1 Study 1: Impacts of Immersion

Virtual embodiment was previously assessed in immersive head-
mounted display (HMD)-based systems in ﬁrst- and third-person
perspective (e.g., [66]), and with less immersive L-Shape displays
[76], or fake mirror scenarios [38]. Recent work conﬁrmed that
visual immersion (i.e., ﬁrst-person perspective and HMD) fosters
virtual embodiment [74]. Thus, we hypothesized H1.1: A lower
immersive display setup is inferior in inducing virtual embodiment.
According to the previous literature [32, 62, 63], we also assumed
that H1.2: Higher immersion results in higher presence. The latter
was also assessed to investigate the relation between the VEQ factors
and presence.

3.1.1 Method

In a one-factor (Medium) between-subjects design modifying the
level of immersion, participants were exposed to either a fake-mirror
projection, in which case the participant had a visual reference to
her or his physical body, or an immersive simulation displayed with
an HMD, in which case the participant saw her or his virtual body
from a ﬁrst-person perspective (Fig. 2). To provoke the perception
of virtual embodiment, participants were asked to perform motions
and focus their attention, similar to related experiments [38, 74], as
described in the following.

Procedure Fig. 3 shows the study procedure. Participants were
welcomed and informed, before the pre-study questionnaire with
demographics and media usage was assessed. Participants were then
equipped, calibrated, and given time to acclimatize to the simulation.
Similar to previous work [38, 74], audio instructions were then pre-
sented to the users to induce embodiment with a total duration of 150

Figure 2: Apparatus (Study 1). Left: The projection condition. Center: The HMD condition. Right: The female and male avatars used for Study 1.

Measures We assessed the VEQ (Cronbach’s α ≥.751) and
the igroup presence questionnaire (IPQ) [60], which was adapted
to ﬁt the presented scenario. The IPQ adaptation assessed general
presence (“In the computer-generated world, I had a sense of ‘being
there”’), spatial presence (e.g., “ I did not feel present in the virtual
space”; α = .786), involvement (e.g., “I was not aware of my real
environment”; α = .851), and realness (e.g., “How real did the
virtual world seem to you?”; α = .672). The responses were given
using a 7-point Likert-type scale (see the original source for the
anchors). Further assessments are not the subject of the present
reporting due to page limitations. No severe sickness effects occured.

Participants We excluded participants when problems or se-
vere tracking errors were noted. The ﬁnal sample consisted of 50
participants (32 female, 18 male, Mage = 22.18, SDage = 2.83). Of
those, 49 participants were students, and 46 participants had pre-
vious experience with VR technologies. The sample was equally
distributed (25 per condition).

3.1.2 Results

Comparisons T-tests were conducted for each individual mea-
sure. The VEQ factors were aggregated according to the scoring
depicted in Table 3. In the case of unequal variances (Levene-test),
corrected values are reported (Welch-test). The perceived change
in body schema was statistically signiﬁcantly different between the
projection condition (M = 2.61, SD = 1.46) and the HMD condi-
tion (M = 3.40, SD = 1.31; t(48) = −2.013, p = .0498, d = 0.61).
As expected, the HMD condition resulted in a stronger perception
of perceived change. Neither ownership (projection: M = 4.81,
SD = 0.85; HMD: M = 4.71, SD = 1.22) nor agency (projection:
M = 6.30, SD = 0.51; HMD: M = 6.18, SD = 0.72) showed a sig-
niﬁcant difference (ps≥ .497). Regarding the IPQ, we found a
signiﬁcant difference with general presence between the projection
condition (M = 3.88, SD = 1.45) and the HMD condition (M = 5.32,
SD = 0.99); t(42.30) = −4.098, p < .001, d = 1.16. This effect
was substantiated by a signiﬁcant difference in the spatial presence
measure between the projection condition (M = 3.88, SD = 1.32)
and the HMD condition (M = 5.03, SD = 1.20); t(48) = −3.218,
p = .002, d = 1.19, as well as for the involvement measure be-
tween the projection condition (M = 3.45, SD = 1.28) and the
HMD condition (M = 5.44, SD = 1.18); t(48) = −5.712, p < .001,
d = 1.62. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the realness measure
t(48) = −0.388, p = .70.

Correlations We calculated bivariate Pearson correlations. Ta-
ble 4 depicts the results. We found signiﬁcant correlations between
ownership and agency, as well as between ownership and general
presence, spatial presence, and realness. The change factor was cor-
related signiﬁcantly with the general presence assessment. Further,
we found correlations within the presence measures.

3.1.3 Discussion
The signiﬁcantly higher perception in the change of the perceived
body schema substantiates previous ﬁndings that showed that higher

s. In these instructions, users were asked to perform actions, mean-
ing to move certain body parts (e.g. “Hold your left arm straight out
with your palm facing down.”), and further focus on one’s own/the
avatar body parts, as well as the body parts of their avatar presented
in a virtual mirror. (“Look at your left hand.” [Pause] “Look at the
same hand in the reﬂection”), followed by a relaxing pose (“Put your
arm comfortably back down and look at your reﬂection”). The full
instructions are described in the supplementary material. Following
the exposition, the dependent measures were assessed.

Apparatus The scenarios and materials are depicted in Fig. 2.
Participants were tracked by an OptiTrack Flex 3 tracking system. A
Unity3D simulation displayed the stimulus via a fake mirror projec-
tion or an Oculus Rift CV1 HMD (2160 px × 1200 px, 90 Hz, 120
degrees diagonal ﬁeld of view). For the projection, the image was
rendered using a ﬁsh tank VR [78] approach with off-axis stereo-
scopic projection [12], and displayed by an Acer H6517ST projector
(projection size: sized 1.31 m high × 1.46 m width, active stero,
480 px × 1080 px per eye). The virtual projection was calibrated to
match the physical projection preferences, thus allowing a physically
accurate mirror image. The virtual camera/tracking point was con-
strained to the avatar head joint while accounting for the distances
of the eyes (head-neck model). The baseline motion-to-photon la-
tency was approximated by video measurement and frame counting
( [25, 75]) to 77 ms for the projection setup, assuming slightly lower
values for the HMD setup. In the virtual environment, the participant
was placed in a living room. A reference point was presented, as
well as a virtual mirror (in the projection condition, the projection
was the mirror; see Fig. 2). We used avatars created with Autodesk
Character Generator (Fig. 2) which were scaled (uniform) according
to the participant’s height.

immersion positively impacts embodiment (H1.1). While Waltemate,
et al. [74] also found immersion to impact ownership over a virtual
body, the proposed scale picked up that the ﬁrst-person perspective
HMD simulation speciﬁcally affected the perceived change of one’s
own body schema. We interpret this as a result of the presence of
a reference to the physical body in the projection condition, and
the absence of such in the HMD condition. This indicates a more
sensitive pinpointing of this effect by the VEQ. This was conﬁrmed
by the expected correlations between ownership and agency as sug-
gested in previous literature, and an absence of correlations of these
components with change. Despite relatively high ratings for agency,
and above scale mean ratings for ownership, these factors were not
signiﬁcantly impacted between conditions.

Supporting H1.2, several presence dimensions were affected. The
HMD condition resulted in greater presence. In addition, we found
positive relations between the VEQ and presence measures. Owner-
ship correlated with general presence, spatial presence, and realness,
whereas the change factor correlated only with the general presence
assessment. Therefore, we assume that presence and embodiment
interact positively. However, we cannot provide any insights into the
causality based on the analysis. We concluded that immersion is a
driving factor for embodiment regarding the fostering of the change
in the perceived body schema, as more immersive HMD-driven sim-
ulations allow for the perception of a virtual body from a ﬁrst-person
perspective without a physical body reference.

3.2 Study 2: User-Performed Personalization

Previous research investigated the use of photogrammetric avatars
and found that personalization can affect the identity with [43], and
the ownership over, a virtual body [30,38,74]. Based on these results,
we hypothesized H2.1: Personalization increases the perception of
ownership over a virtual body. However, whether this assumption
holds true using avatar creation tools instead of photogrammetric
scanning is an open question and the topic of Study 2.

3.2.1 Method
In a one-factor (Personalization) between-subjects design, we com-
pared the embodiment with an avatar from a creation tool to a
personalized avatar created with the same tool. Participants were
represented either as a gender-matched generic avatar (Caucasian–as
we expected a Caucasian sample) or by a personalized avatar they
created as a representation of themselves (see Fig. 4).

create an avatar (personalized condition) or to inspect the generic
avatar (generic avatar condition). In the personalized condition,
participants were taught the avatar generator software and provided
help. Participants were permitted to modify the virtual character’s
body measures (form, proportions), facial appearance, and hairstyle
in 15 min of preparation time. The clothing was kept similar in the
two conditions. Following the avatar creation/inspection, a similarity
measure was assessed. Participants were then calibrated and had
time to acclimatize to the simulation. Similar to Study 1, audio
instructions asking participants to perform movements and focus on
body parts were used for the embodiment exposition. In addition
to the instructions for Study 1, the participants were speciﬁcally
instructed to step closer to the mirror and pay attention to features of
the character’s appearance (e.g., “Look at the eyes of the mirrored
self,” “Look at the mouth of the mirrored self,” “Turn 90 degrees
and look at the mirrored self from the side”). The instructions lasted
for 180 s and are described in detail in the supplementary material.

Apparatus The apparatus consisted of a setup identical to the
HMD-based setup of Study 1, except that a FOVE 0 HMD (2560
px × 1440 px, 70 Hz, 100 degrees ﬁeld of view) was used as the
display.

Measures We measured demographic variables, the VEQ (αs
≥ .744), and affect using the PANAS scale in the short form [70] (PA:
α = .840; NA α = .319, dropped from analyses). As we expected
that personalization may also have an impact on self-presence, we as-
sessed Ratan and Hasler’s self-presence questionnaire [54], adapted
to the context of the study (excluded: “To what extent does your
avatars proﬁle info represent some aspect of your personal identity?”
and “To what extent does your avatars name represent some aspect
of your personal identity?”). Proto–self-presence (α = .781) was
assessed with items such as “How much do you feel like your avatar
is an extension of your body within the virtual environment?” Core
self-presence (α = .838) was assessed with items such as “When
arousing events would happen to your avatar, to what extent do you
feel aroused?” Extended self-presence (α = .661) was assessed
with items like “To what extent is your avatars gender related to
some aspect of your personal identity?” (5-point scale, see [54]).
To control for the manipulation, we measured the perceived similar-
ity toward the avatar (generic or personalized) before the exposure
(desktop monitor), and after the exposure (reﬂecting the experience):
“Please rate how much the virtual character is similar to you on the
following scale, where 1 equals no similarity and 11 equals a digital
twin.” Further measures such as sickness and humanness are not
part of the present discussion. No severe sickness effects occurred.

Participants We excluded participants when problems or severe
tracking errors were noted. The ﬁnal sample consisted of participants
(generic avatar: N = 25, personalized avatar: N = 23. 27 female,
21 male, Mage = 21.64, SDage = 2.25). All 48 participants were
students, and 45 participants had previous experience with VR.

generic condition (M = 4.36, SD = 1.26), but not to a signiﬁcant
level (p = .124). Similar images appeared regarding agency (person-
alized: M = 6.11, SD = 0.56; generic: M = 5.84, SD = 0.79), and
change (personalized: M = 3.55, SD = 1.53; generic: M = 2.97,
SD = 1.30); ps≥ .159. We found a signiﬁcantly higher positive
affect for the personalized avatar condition (M = 3.64, SD = 0.68)
compared to the generic avatar condition (M = 3.14, SD = 0.64;
t(46) = 2.655, p = .011, d = 0.75). We found a signiﬁcant ef-
fect for proto-self-presence, showing higher ratings for the per-
sonalized avatar condition (M = 3.59, SD = 0.67) compared to
the generic avatar condition (M = 3.04, SD = 0.81; t(46) = 2.528,
p = .015, d = 0.734). The perceived pre-exposure similarity with
the virtual character was higher for the personalized condition
(M = 5.30, SD = 1.72) compared to the generic condition (M = 4.64,
SD = 1.98), but not to a signiﬁcant level.
In the post-exposure
measurement, these differences were almost equal (personalized:
M = 5.13, SD = 1.71; generic: M = 5.16, SD = 2.04).

Correlations Bivariate Pearson correlations are presented in
Table 5. The ownership factor correlated with agency and change.
Agency and ownership correlated with the post-exposure similarity
measure, whereas the change factor did not. All embodiment factors
correlated with the proto-self-presence measure. Interestingly, the
agency factor correlated with a perceived positive affect.

3.2.3 Discussion
Contrasting our assumption and previous work on photogrammetric
personalization [38, 74], we did not ﬁnd evidence for H2.1. The
personalization procedure did not signiﬁcantly affect ownership,
or other VEQ factors. A mere self-performed personalization did
not provoke ownership to a strong degree, which is partially also
supported by the post-exposure similarity measure. The results
are limited by the fact that the participants’ clothing was not per-
sonalized and that the creation was limited in time, as well as the
participants’ software skillset. Yet, the manipulation affected the
perception, as participants perceived higher self-presence in the sim-
ulation. We found a positive association between the post-exposure
similarity, ownership and agency, conﬁrming their relation. The
correlations between the VEQ factors and the self-presence mea-
sures point at a relationship between embodiment and the perception
presence, potentially feelings and impressions that may be evoked
by simulation events when controlling an avatar.

We concluded that the self-performed, character generator-based
personalization procedure did not evoke signiﬁcanly higher per-
ceived embodiment, contrasting with the results for photogrammet-
ric personalization. Further, the study showed that covariance is
shared between aspects of self-presence and embodiment.

3.3 Study 3: Behavioral Realism
A comparison of different degrees of behavioral realism and the
impact on virtual embodiment, to our knowledge, has not yet been
investigated. As agency speciﬁcally relates to controlling one’s

sory data (exemple images). c Replication. d Gaze detail example.

own movements [72], we hypothesized H3.1: Increased behavioral
realism increases the perceived agency over a virtual body.

3.3.1 Method

In a two-factor (Facial Expressions, Gaze) between-subjects design,
we evaluated the impact of behavioral realism. Participants were
represented by generic avatars (see Fig. 4, top) and randomly as-
signed to one of four conditions: body motion only (BO), body and
facial motion replication (BF), body and gaze motion replication
(BG), and body, gaze, and face motion replication (BFG).

Procedure The procedure followed the general procedure (Fig.
3). Participants were welcomed and informed, before we assessed
the pre-study questionnaire. Participants were then calibrated and
had time to acclimatize. Audio instructions then asked participants
to perform bodily movements and focus on body parts. In Study
3, the participants were speciﬁcally instructed to move closer to
another marking in front of the mirror, and let their gaze wander to
speciﬁc focus points, trying to ensure an inﬂuence in perception of
the manipulation (e.g., “Fixate on the left eye of your mirrored-self,”
“Focus on the right ear of your mirrored self” etc.). For the facial
expressions, we asked participants to perform certain expressions
(e.g., “Open and close your mouth,” “Try to express happiness by
smiling at your mirrored-self,” etc.). The instructions lasted for 219 s
and are described in the supplementary material. After the exposure,
we assessed the dependent measures.

Apparatus We used the same apparatus and generic avatars
as in Study 2, and included the tracking of the participant’s gaze
using the FOVE 0’s eye tracking system as well as facial expression
tracking performed by a BinaryVR Dev Kit V1. Combining the two
individual eye vectors, the FOVE integration calculates the inter-
section point to estimate the convergence point in the virtual scene,
which is the approximate focus point of the user [79]. From this po-
sition, we recalculated the eyeball rotation. The BinaryVR Dev Kit
was used to gather information about lower facial deformation. The
3D depth-sensing device Pico Flexx (up to 45 Hz) was afﬁxed to the
HMDs. Its 2D and depth images were processed by the BinaryVR
Dev Kit to generate facial deformation parameters [29, 83]. Tracked
expression parameters were mapped to blendshapes, for example,
jaw open, and smile. The body tracking, facial expression, and gaze
data was fused in the simulation to drive the avatar (see Fig. 5).

Measures We assessed the VEQ (αs ≥ .732), a rating of the
avatar assessing humanness, eeriness, and attractiveness (αs ≥ .688)
[26], the self-presence measures previously applied in Study 2 (αs
≥ .645) [54], as well as affect (αs ≥ .674) [28,70]. We further asked
how real, how natural, and how synchronous the motion behavior
of the avatar appeared to the participants: “The movements were
realistic,” “The movements were naturalistic,” “The movements
were in synchrony to my own movements” (1–strongly disagree,
7–strongly agree). Further measures were excluded due to page
limitations. No severe sickness effects occurred.

Participants We excluded participants when problems or se-
vere tracking errors were noted. The ﬁnal sample for the analy-
sis consisted of 70 participants (46 female, 24 male, Mage = 21.3,
SDage = 1.82, all students), of whom 65 had previous VR experi-
ence. 17 participants were assigned to the BO condition, 18 to BF,
18 to BG, and 17 to BFG.

3.3.2 Results

Comparisons We calculated two-factor (gaze, facial expres-
sion) analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Although the BFG condition
was rated highest in ownership (Ms between 4.28 and 4.68) and
highest in control (Ms between 5.65 and 5.99), the differences were
not signiﬁcant. We found a signiﬁcant effect of gaze on the perceived
humanness; F(1, 66) = 7.826, p = .007, η 2
p = .106, indicating that
the perceived humanness was higher in the conditions with enabled
gaze tracking and replication (M = 3.07, SD = 0.78) compared to
the conditions with disabled gaze tracking and replication (M = 2.60,
SD = 0.60). No further signiﬁcant effects were observed.

3.3.3 Discussion

We did not ﬁnd supporting evidence for H1.3. Increased behav-
ior realsim did not signiﬁcantly impact the perceived embodiment
between conditions. The additional gaze replication resulted in a
greater perception of humanness. Regarding the perceived agency,
we interpret that the facial expression and gaze replication did not
have a strong inﬂuence in comparison to body movement, which
was always present and represents greater motion dynamics, and ar-
guably evokes a stronger visual stimulation. Future research should
investigate body movement as an additional manipulation factor.
Some limitations arise. The detection of facial and gaze behavior
was limited by the visual resolution of the display. However, the
participants stood especially close (about 50 cm) to the virtual mirror
during parts of the induction phase. Third, the induction phase might
have been too short for some participants, and as a result, the time
spent on the gaze and facial expression interaction might not have
been sufﬁcient.

3.4 Study 4: Latency and Latency Jitter

In an independent fourth study, we further validated the scale, specif-
ically targeting the agency factor. Previous work suggested that
latency negatively impacts virtual embodiment [77]. Thus, we hy-
pothesized H4.1: Latency negatively impacts components of virtual
embodiment. Although linear latencies were subject to previous in-
vestigations [77], the impact of latency jitter has not been assessed.

3.4.1 Method

In a one-factor (Latency Level) repeated-measures design, we eval-
uated the impact of latency and latency jitter, meaning the non-
periodic spontaneous peaks of latency, on the perception of the
factors of the VEQ. Participants were exposed to four conditions of
delayed and jitter-delayed simulation display (baseline, LB; small
latency, LS; large latency, LL; latency jitter, LJ).

Procedure The procedure followed the procedure depicted in
Fig. 3 in repeated fashion. We welcomed participants and informed
them, before assessing the pre-study questionnaire. The exposure
conditions were then presented to the participants in randomized
order. In each trial, the participants were calibrated, exposed to
the simulation and induction, followed by an assessment of the
dependent measures. In the audio instructions, the participants were
speciﬁcally instructed to perform more rapid and ﬂuid movements
(e.g., “Raise your left arm at moderate speed in front of you, and
lower it back down next to your hip. Repeat this movement ten
times, and focus on your arm while doing so”). The complete
audio instructions are described in the supplementary material. The
instructions lasted for 282 s.

Apparatus We used a similar apparatus Study 2. By buffer-
ing the tracking input data from the motion tracking system, arti-
ﬁcial delays were introduced into the simulation by buffering and
delaying the replication of the body motion tracking data. We pre-
vented biasing sickness effects and inﬂuenced only the delay of the
body movements, but did not inﬂuence the delay of the virtual
camera (head movements, respectively), which, therefore, trans-
formed according to the raw system delay without further modiﬁca-
tions. Thus, the body motion was delayed, whereas the camera/head
pose was not. We adapted the procedure described by Stauffert, et
al. [68] to introduce latency jitter, which uses a stochastical model
for latency distribution, introducing high-latency spikes into the
simulation. Motion-to-photon latency of the resulting simulations
was approximated by video frame counting (Canon, 1000 Hz). The
measures resulted in M = 90.12 ms (SD = 16.14 ms) for the simu-
lation baseline LB, M = 206.93 ms (SD = 16.47 ms) for the small
delay LS, M = 353.07 ms (SD = 15.38 ms) for the larger delay LL,
and M = 102.58 ms (SD = 49.71 ms) for LJ. LB, LS, and LL were
measured with 60 samples (see Fig. 6). Despite measuring N = 165
repetitions in the jitter condition LJ, the resulting mean and SD may
not accurately reﬂect the induced jitter, due to some spikes that could
not be captured using the motion-apex measurement applied. Users
were embodied with the generic avatars (see Fig. 4).

Measures We assessed the VEQ (αs ≥ .771) and performed
a comparison to the questionnaire developed for RHI experiments
by Kalckert and Ehrsson (KE) [31] (partly adapted from [41]), that
measures ownership (αs ≥ .801), ownership control (αs ≥ .655),
agency (αs ≥ .636), and agency control (αs between .239 and .563)
with a 7-point Likert-type scale (1–strongly disagree, 7–strongly
agree). Questioning was adapted to ﬁt the scenario (e.g., “The
rubber hand moved just like I wanted it to, as if it was obeying
my will” = “The virtual body moved just like I wanted it to, as
if it was obeying my will”). As manipulation control, we asked
how realistic, natural, and synchronous the movements of the avatar
appeared to the participants: “The movements were realistic,” “The
movements were naturalistic,” “The movements were in synchrony
to my own movements” (1–strongly disagree, 7–strongly agree).
Further measures are not part of the present discussion. No severe
sickness effects occurred.

Participants We excluded participants when problems or severe
tracking errors occured. The ﬁnal sample consisted of 22 participants
(17 female, 5 male, Mage = 21.77, SDage = 3.62, 22 students), of
whom 21 had previous experience with VR.

3.4.2 Results

Comparisons We calculated repeated-measures ANOVAs for
each dependent variable. Where the assumption of sphericity was
violated, we report Greenhouse–Geisser corrected values. Fig. 6
depicts the descriptive results. We found a signiﬁcant main effect
for ownership; F(3, 63) = 3.57, p = .024, η 2
p = .138. Similarly,
agency measure was affected; F(1.741, 63.553) = 7.50, p = .003,
η 2
p = .263. No signiﬁcant impacts were observed for change. We did
not observe any signiﬁcant main effects in the agency and ownership
measures of the scale adapted from KE [31]. The synchronicity
assessment showed a signiﬁcant main effect F(1.905, 40.005) =
7.077, p = .003, η 2
p = .252. In contrast, neither the realism, nor
the naturalness of behavior showed a signiﬁcant main effect. The
strongest linear latency injection (LL) yielded to the lowest scoring
of ownership and agency (see Fig. 6). The jitter condition was
similarly affected, but resulted in signiﬁcantly better ratings than the
condition with the largest latency injection. The lower level linear
latency (LS) had comparable results to the jitter-injected condition.
Similarly, the synchronicity ratings were affected (see Fig. 6).

Correlations Pearson correlations are depicted in Table 6. The
synchronicity assessment showed large correlations with the agency

factor of the VEQ and the agency factor of the scale from KE [31].
Furthermore, synchronicity showed a medium to large correlation
with the ownership factor, and the KE ownership factor. In turn,
ownership showed medium to large correlations with agency, and a
large correlation with ownership (KE) and ownership control (KE)
across all measures. Interestingly, we did not ﬁnd stable correlations
between the perceived naturalness, synchronicity, and realism of the
movement, providing room for further discussion.

3.4.3 Discussion

The results support H4.1, that embodiment is negatively affected by
simulation delays, which is in line with previous ﬁndings [77]. The
descriptive results reveal that a jitter (in the applied spectrum) can
result in a decreased perception of ownership and agency compared
to an average latency of approximately 207 ms, which emphasizes
the negative impact of latency jitter. However, the total delay of
about 353 ms performed worse than the jitter condition, which quan-
tiﬁes the impact of jitter to some extent. The correlations conﬁrmed
that the VEQ picks up modiﬁcations in movement synchronicity.
Although we found expected correlations between the agency fac-
tor and the additionally assessed agency (KE) and ownership (KE)
measures, variance analysis revealed that the VEQ showed greater
sensitivity in the present scenario. This may result from the fact that
the (KE) questions were developed for the RHI (i.e., physical world
body part) scenarios. Although the results conﬁrmed the expected
correlations between ownership and agency, we could show that the

change factor was not affected by modiﬁcations in the motion di-
mension, and thus, the VEQ validly discriminates the factors to this
regard. One limitation is that the agency control measure adapted
from the (KE) questionnaire had overall low reliabilities, which is,
in turn, a further argument for the proposed VEQ. In conclusion,
we found signiﬁcant impacts of latency and jitter on ownership and
agency, and could further quantify the impact of jitter.

4 GENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Overarching the individual ﬁndings of the studies, our high-level
goal was the construction and validation of the Virtual Embodiment
Questionnaire (VEQ). The proposed scale is not merely theoretical,
but instead, its factors are statistically conﬁrmed through rigorous
scale development. The CFA conﬁrmed the previously explored
factor of the change in the perceived body schema [58], which
could especially be relevant for VR applications in the context of
therapy and disorder treatment [51], as we assume it is a poten-
tial predecessor of the Proteus effect [81]. Future research may
investigate potential moderations, e.g., whether higher ownership
fosters a change perception. Regarding the performance of the VEQ,
acceptable to good reliabilities were conﬁrmed with analyses of
Cronbach’s α throughout all studies. In contrast to previous com-
ponent identiﬁcations [41], the VEQ focuses on virtual experiences.
Further, the VEQ showed higher sensitivity to manipulations com-
pared to a previous scale constructions [31] that aimed at assessing
physical world RHI-like experiments. Compared to related mea-
sures for physical world experiments (KE) [31], the VEQ reacted
more sensitive to performed latency manipulations. The VEQ also
reacted validly and sensitively in the regard that we could conﬁrm
and further specify the impact of immersion: immersion speciﬁcally
addresses the perception of a change in the perceived body schema.
We further showed that the proposed measure to part correlates
with related constructs of presence or self-presence but discrimi-
nates those from virtual embodiment components. By investigating
internal correlations of the VEQ, we could also conﬁrm a correla-
tion between agency and ownership as mentioned in previous works
(e.g., [13, 72]). The change component assessing the perceived
change of one’s own body schema seems to be separable, in most
regards. We interpret the conﬁrmation of this component to be specif-
ically relevant for VR. We conﬁrmed that immersion (ﬁrst-person
perspective and HMD display) is a driver of this component, and
thus desktop games or simulations or third-person VR simulations
may not evoke this perception.

Some limitations arise. In contrast to the suggestions by Gonzalez-
Franco and Peck, the VEQ does not include “external appearance,”
or “response to external stimuli,” which may be the subject of future
work. However, as also noted by Gonzalez-Franco and Peck [23]
and reviewed in Section 1, the previous literature topics body own-
ership, agency, and self-location in the context of embodiment
(e.g. [8, 9, 31, 32, 46, 51]). The VEQ lacks of the assessment of
self-location. The initial and updated questionnaire did not strictly
concentrate on this factor. We argue that disturbed self-location (self-
localization) is a factor typically present with disorders (paroxysmal
illusions) evoking disrupted body perception, such as heautoscopy,
out-of-body experiences, or autoscopic hallucinations (see [13, 42]).
Although self-location discrepancies can be assessed in RHI exper-

iments [11] or out-of-body experiences [4], it is typically not the
goal of VR applications to evoke such effects but rather to accurately
reassemble the user’s location, ﬁrst-person perspective (see [32] for
a discussion), and behavior. Therefore, self-location may be subject
to future extensions or alternatively assessed with implicit measures,
such as displacement measures [11]. The present ﬁndings are also
limited by the applied scenarios and the collected sample form and
size. Future work should consequently assess the reliability and
consistency of the VEQ, along with its application to different (non-
mirror) scenarios, such as user-embodying games, and more abstract
avatar types with varying form and appearances. In this regard, we
can only assume that the measure is objective (i.e., shielded from
third-party bias) on the basis of our results, as shown in a multi-study
setting. The questionnaire is available at [url] in [languages]. The
simulation codes are available upon request.

In conclusion, we presented the creation of a validated virtual
embodiment questionnaire (VEQ) that can be applied to various VR
experiments to assess latent factors of virtual embodiment.
