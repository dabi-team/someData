Abstract 

Despite  the  technological  advancements  in  Virtual  Reality  (VR),  users  are  constantly 

combating feelings of nausea and disorientation, the so called cybersickness.  Cybersickness 

symptoms  cause  severe  discomfort  and  hinder  the  immersive  VR  experience.    Here  we 

investigated  cybersickness  in  360-degree  head-mounted  display  VR.    In  traditional  360-

degree VR experiences, translational movement in the real world is not reflected in the virtual 

world,  and  therefore  self-motion  information  is  not  corroborated  by  matching  visual  and 

vestibular cues, which may trigger symptoms of cybersickness.  We have evaluated whether 

a  new  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  software  designed  to  supplement  the  360-degree  VR 

experience  with  artificial  6-degrees-of-freedom  motion  may  reduce  cybersickness.    Explicit 

(simulator  sickness  questionnaire  and  fast  motion  sickness  rating)  and  implicit  (heart  rate) 

measurements were used to evaluate cybersickness symptoms during and after 360-degree 

VR exposure.  Simulator sickness scores showed a significant reduction in feelings of nausea 

during  the  AI  supplemented  6-degrees-of-freedom  motion  VR  compared  to  traditional  360-

degree  VR.    However,  6-degrees-of-freedom  motion  VR  did  not  reduce  oculomotor  or 

disorientation measures of sickness. No changes have been observed in fast motion sickness 

and heart rate measures.  Improving the congruency between visual and vestibular cues in 

360-degree  VR,  as  provided  by  the  AI  supplemented  6-degrees-of-freedom  motion  system 

considered, is essential to provide a more engaging, immersive and safe VR, which is critical 

for educational, cultural and entertainment applications.

1. Introduction 

As we move through the external environment, the vestibular system in the inner ear provides 

a flow of information regarding the position of our head in the three-dimensional space.  The 

vestibular system comprises of three orthogonal semicircular canals (anterior, posterior and 

horizontal), that respectively sense rotational acceleration of the head in space and around 

the cardinal yaw, roll, and pitch axes, and two otolith organs (utricle and saccule) that sense 

translational  acceleration,  including  the  orientation  of  the  head  relative  to  gravity.    These 

signals  are  crucial  for  self-motion  perception  (Chen  et  al.,  2008)  confirming  the  essential 

vestibular contribution to the brain’s Global Positioning System. 

Typically, vestibular inputs are perfectly matching with optic flow information from the 

images moving across the retina.  The brain optimally integrates vestibular and visual signals 

to create a coherent perception of the direction and speed of self-motion (Butler et al., 2010; 

Fetsch et al., 2009; Greenlee et al., 2016).  However, there are some circumstances in which 

visual and vestibular signals for self-motion may not match and potentially conflict. This is the 

case of Virtual Reality (VR).  The promise of VR has always been enormous and the ability to 

immerse a user in a virtual environment through the use of 3D real-time computer graphics 

and advanced head-mounted display devices has been shown to be beneficial in a number of 

applications like engineering, education and entertainment.  VR has grown exponentially in 

popularity in recent years.  Improvements in resolution, latency, flicker rate and motion tracking 

have enhanced the VR experience.  However, a troubling problem remains where up to 80% 

of VR users experience debilitating symptoms of discomfort, disorientation, nausea, eyestrain, 

headaches  and  sweating,  a  malady  called  cybersickness  (LaViola,  2000;  Rebenitsch  and 

Owen, 2016). Cybersickness is characterised by severe and frequent disorientation symptoms 

(dizziness,  vertigo,  and  difficulty  in  focusing),  followed  by  nausea  symptoms  (stomach 

awareness,  increased  salivation,  and  nausea  itself),  and  least  oculomotor  symptoms 

(eyestrain, headache, and blurred vision), the so-called D>N>O profile (Rebenitsch and Owen, 

2016; Stanney and Kennedy, 1997).  This symptom profile distinguishes cybersickness from 

3 

 
other  types  of  motion  sickness,  such  as  simulator  sickness  and  sea  sickness.    Critically, 

cybersickness  may  hinder  the  immersive  and  interactive  qualities  of  VR  and  its  real-life 

applications (Yildirim, 2019). 

Although its causes are not entirely clear, cybersickness may be due to a discrepancy 

between vestibular and visual information about body’s orientation and self-motion (Gallagher 

and Ferrè, 2018; Reason and Brand, 1975; Reason, 1978).  In typical VR scenarios, such as 

a  VR  driving  simulator,  the  simulation  provides  accurate  optic  flow  patterns  of  the  road, 

surrounding  buildings,  people  and  other  parts  of  the  environment,  which  elicit  visual 

information of self-motion (vection; So et al., 2001).  The visual signals tell the brain that the 

user is moving with a certain speed and in a certain direction.  However, since the user is not 

actually moving, the vestibular organs signal zero angular or translational acceleration.  Thus, 

if  the  perception  of  vection  is  not  corroborated  by  self-motion  signals  transmitted  by  the 

vestibular  system,  a  sensory  conflict  is  likely  to  occur,  and  cybersickness  may  ensue.  

Accordingly, higher levels of cybersickness have been described in flight simulators and in VR 

games  in  which  a  high  level  of  sensory  conflict  is  present.    However,  other  accounts  of 

cybersickness have been suggested.  For instance, it has been proposed that the provocative 

stimulus  is  the  postural  instability  triggered  in  VR  (Stoffregen,  1991;  Stoffregen,  2014). 

Additionally,  the  sensory  conflict  account  has  been  refined  by  some  to  focus  mainly  on 

mismatches  between  the  estimated  and  true  environmental  vestibular  vertical  (Bos  et  al., 

2008). A common feature of these accounts seems to be that perceptual systems are highly 

reliable and accurate and VR technology challenges the senses and their integration. 

Recent  studies  have  shown  promising  results  in  reducing  cybersickness  by  visuo-

vestibular sensory re-coupling methods.  Cybersickness improves when the absent vestibular 

information  during  simulated  self-motion  are  mimicked  by  applying  natural  or  artificial 

vestibular stimulation.  For instance, using a rotational chair and timely coupling of physical 

movement with VR effectively reduced cybersickness symptoms (Ng et al., 2020).  Similarly, 

cybersickness  has  been  shown  to  improve  with  Galvanic  Vestibular  Stimulation  (GVS)  to 

artificially mimic vestibular cues in VR (Gallagher et al., 2020; Weech et al., 2018).

However, research has mainly focused on visuo-vestibular conflicts triggered by VR 

environments  in  which  vestibular  signals  are  absent.    That  is,  when  VR  users  feel  the 

sensation of travelling through a virtual environment, while actually remaining stationary in the 

real world.  Little is known on visuo-vestibular conflicts in VR scenarios in which the user is 

allowed to move, such as in 360-degree VR.  360-degree VR refers to videos or photos that 

are captured using specialist omnidirectional cameras comprised of multiple lens that enable 

filming of a full panoramic view of 360 degrees.  The user is therefore able to look around the 

entire scene and perceive an immersive experience.  However, in almost all 360-degree VR 

experiences, movement in the real physical world is not reflected in the virtual world.  In other 

words,  current-generation  360-degree  VR  supports  only  3-degrees-of-freedom  rotational 

motion where the virtual scene reflects changes in the rotation of the user’s head, but does 

not support translational motion.  Thus, VR lacks the 6-degrees-of-freedom self-motion that 

we  normally  experience  in  the  real  world  provided  by  multisensory  integration  between 

dynamic  visual  and  6-degrees-of-freedom  vestibular  cues,  as  well  as  the  within  channel 

integration between angular acceleration cues sensed by the vestibular semicircular canals 

and  translational  acceleration  sensed  by  the  otolith  organs.    Perhaps  not  surprisingly,  the 

sensory mismatch in traditional 360-degree VR may easily induce cybersickness symptoms.  

Many  studies  have  reported  various  physical  symptoms  such  as  headaches,  focusing 

difficulties and dizziness during 360-degree VR viewing (Carnegie and Rhee, 2015; Elwardy 

et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Padmanaban et al., 2018). 

Here,  we  consider  cybersickness  in  360-degree  head-mounted  display  VR.  We 

systematically explored the cybersickness profile in settings where there are minimal dynamic 

visual  inputs  combined  with  translational  vestibular  inputs.  We  also  investigate  the 

effectiveness of a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) based software in reducing cybersickness.  

Where previous VR applications have focused on a 3-degrees-of-freedom rotational motion, 

this software aims to reduce cybersickness through providing both rotational and translational 

motion.  We predict that this AI based software may improve the congruency between visual 

5 

 
and vestibular signals during VR exposure and enhance realism.  This may have a potential 

impact on immersive VR experience with fewer unwanted side effects of cybersickness.  

2. Methods 

2.1. Ethics 

The  experimental  protocol  was  approved  by  the  ethics  committee  at  Royal  Holloway, 

University of London. The experiment was conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki. 

Written informed consent was obtained prior to commencing the experiment.  

2.2. Participants 

Twenty-five healthy right-handed participants volunteered in the study (19 women; mean age= 

22.16  years,  SD  =  7.12  years).    The  sample  size  was  estimated  a  priori  based  on  similar 

experimental procedures (Gallagher et al., 2019; Gallagher et al., 2020), set in advance of 

testing  and  was  also  used  as  data-collection  stopping  rule.    Participants  with  a  history  of 

neurological, psychiatric, vestibular or auditory disorders were excluded.  

2.3.  An  AI-based  software  to  provide  6-degree-of-freedom  Virtual  Reality 

experience 

An AI-based software solution, copernic3601, has been developed by Kagenova2 to provide 6-

degrees-of-freedom motion in 360-degree VR by simulating translational motion (McEwen et al., 2020).  

When using copernic360 the user is able to move within the 360-degree VR experience, e.g. by walking 

around or leaning forward to inspect the content in the scene, and a synthetic view is generated based 

on the user's position in the scene.  In this manner full 6-degrees-of-freedom motion, including both 

translational and rotational motion, is supported.  This system is designed not only to provide a more

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
realistic and immersive experience but to also reduce the mismatch between visual and vestibular cues 

when in a 360-degree VR experience. 

To achieve this effect, copernic360 includes two main sub-systems: a back-end AI-based cloud 

processing system; and a front-end viewer system in the form of a game engine plugin.  The AI-based 

cloud system processes 360-degree VR video or photo content to recover an estimate of 3D geometry 

representing the scene.  First, AI-based depth estimation techniques are used to estimate a depth map 

corresponding to the 360-degree content.  A residual convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is 

adopted, with dilated convolutions (Yu and Koltun, 2016) in order to expand the receptive field for dense 

predictions, like depth estimation.  The architecture is similar to that previously presented by Li and 

colleagues (Li et al.. 2017), but adapted for spherical 360-degree content.  Second, the estimated 360-

degree depth information is then used to fit a parametric 3D geometry representing the scene, which is 

stored as additional meta data associated with the original content.  The geometry is fitted by minimising 

an  error  cost  function.    Third,  the  viewer  system  uses  the  meta  data  computed  by  the  AI-based 

processing system representing the parametric 3D geometry, along with the original 360-degree video 

or photo content, to then render a 3D textured representation of the scene.  The original 360-degree 

content is projected onto the 3D geometry to provide a texture for the geometry.  Finally, note that for 

360-degree video content, the entire process is repeated for each key frame of the video.  A key frame 

represents a frame where the content of the video has changed considerably compared to the prior 

frame (e.g., due to a cut between scenes or the content of a scene changing over time).  Between key 

frames the 3D geometry is interpolated.  In this manner, the user is then able to move about in the 

reconstructed scene with full 6-degrees-of-freedom motion and novel synthetic viewpoints of the scene 

are then rendered and served to the user depending on their position in the scene. 

A  custom  scenario  was  adapted  for  VR.    The  scenario  consisted  of  a  beach 

(https://www.atmosphaeres.com/video/445/Rocky+Headland) in which participants could move around 

for about 10 minutes.  Natural sounds were integrated such as the sounds of waves along with an 

auditory cue played every 20s.  The auditory cue signalled participants to provide a motion sickness 

scores and for the researcher to record heart rate variability (see below).  

7 

 
 
2.4. Experimental Design and Procedure 

Verbal and written instructions were given to participants at the beginning of the experiment.  Data from 

each participant was gathered in two experimental sessions.  Participants were exposed to the same 

scene  in  both  standard360-VR  (3-degrees-of-freedom  VR)  and  the  copernic360-VR  (6-degrees-of-

freedom  VR)  conditions.    The  order  of  experimental  conditions  was  counterbalanced  between 

participants.  In each session, participants were asked to wear an HTC Vive head-mounted display 

(HMD) and asked to walk in a square pattern with a 90 degrees turn in direction at each point (Fig. 1A).  

Participants were trained with the walking pattern before the VR began.  An auditory cue instructed 

participants to look down, explore the VR scene and touch the ground.  It was anticipated that this would 

invoke greater nausea in the conventional 3-degrees-of-freedom VR conditions due to the mismatch of 

visuo-vestibular cues.  A webcam was used to record the walking patterns as well as verbal responses. 

To assess levels of cybersickness, participants completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire 

(SSQ; Kennedy et al., 1993) following conclusion of the VR scenario.  This well-established questionnaire 

asks participants to score 16 symptoms on a four point scale (0=none, 3=severe). The questionnaire 

divides  symptoms  of  sickness  into  components  of  Nausea  (SSQ-N),  Disorientation  (SSQ-D)  and 

Oculomotor (SSQ-O) clusters (Kennedy et al., 1993).  Disorientation (SSQ-D) includes symptoms such 

as dizziness, vertigo and difficulty focusing.  Oculomotor (SSQ-O) includes physical symptoms such as 

eyestrain, headache and blurred vision.  Nausea (SSQ-N) is comprised of symptoms including stomach 

awareness,  increased  salivation  and  nausea  itself.    The  SSQ-N,  SSQ-O,  and  SSQ-D  scores  are 

calculated from the weighted totals using the following conversion formulas (Kennedy et al., 1993): 

SSQ-N = [ Sum obtained by adding symptom scores ] x 9.54 

SSQ-O = [ Sum obtained by adding symptom scores ] x 7.58 

SSQ-D = [ Sum obtained by adding symptom scores ] x 13.92 

Scores are then summed together to obtain a single score (Total, SSQ-T = (Nausea + Oculomotor + 

Disorientation) x 3.74). 

8 

 
 
 
During VR exposure, participants were asked to perform the Fast Motion Sickness Scale (FMS; 

Keshavarz and Hecht, 2011) and give a verbal rating of the level of nausea from 0-20 (0=no nausea; 

20= frank sickness).  Responses were collected every 20 seconds when an auditory cue was played 

during VR, before, and immediately after VR exposure.  Participants’ heart rate was also monitored 

throughout the VR scenario.  Heart rate (HR) has been shown to increase with greater levels of sickness 

in VR (Kim et al., 2005; Nalivaiko et al., 2015). Participants wore a smart watch (Mio ALPHA 2 smart 

watch,  Mio  Technology,  Taipei,  Taiwan)  which  provided  continuous  readings  of  heart  rate,  with 

measurements recorded at the same time as the FMS ratings.  Thus, heart rate was recorded once prior 

to commencing the VR scenario, every 20 seconds during the scenario, and once immediately following 

the scenario. 

Participants  were  also  asked  to  complete  the  Motion  Sickness  Susceptibility  Questionnaire 

Short-form  (MSSQ)  and  a  Gaming  Experience  Questionnaire  to  ensure  that  motion  sickness 

susceptibility and previous VR experience were similar across our sample. 

2.5. Data analysis 

Supporting data are available as Supplementary Material. 

The  data  was  analysed  using  parametric  tests.    Parametric  tests  are  a  preferred 

method in repeated measures randomised designs in which the interest is on the effects of an 

intervention/treatment vs. baseline/control (Vickers, 2005). Importantly, parametric tests have 

generally more statistical power than nonparametric tests, and are therefore are more likely to 

detect a significant effect when one truly exists. 

Paired  t-tests  were  used  to  analyse  differences  between  the  standard360-VR  (3-

degrees-of-freedom VR) and copernic360-VR (6-degrees-of-freedom VR) conditions.  T-tests 

were applied on the SSQ scales (SSQ-N, SSQ-D, SSQ-O) and total scores (SSQ-T). 

A 2 x 3 Repeated Measures ANOVA was used to explore the changes in FMS and HR 

measures across the time.  Average FMS value and peak FMS value during VR exposure 

were  entered  in  two  distinct  ANOVAs  comparing  differences  FMS  scores  between  VR 

9 

 
 
conditions (standard360-VR vs copernic360-VR) across time (Pre-VR, During-VR and Post-

VR).  Similarly, average HR value and peak HR value during VR exposure were entered in 

two distinct ANOVAs comparing differences in HR between VR conditions (standard360-VR 

vs copernic360-VR) across time (Pre-VR, During-VR and Post-VR). Mauchly’s test was used 

to investigate whether the assumption of sphericity was violated, and accordingly the degrees 

of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser.

Figure 1. Experimental Set Up and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) Results 

(A) Participants were exposed to a custom Virtual Reality (VR) scenario in both standard360-VR (3-

degrees-of-freedom  VR)  and  the  copernic360-VR  (6-degrees-of-freedom  VR)  setting.    (B)  Results 

showed  a  significant  reduction  in  nausea  on  the  Simulator  Sickness  Questionnaire  (SSQ)  in  the 

copernic360-VR  condition  compared  to  standard360-VR  (3-degrees-of-freedom  VR).    No  significant 

differences  emerged  on  the  oculomotor  and  disorientation  dimensions  of  the  questionnaire.    No 

significant difference also emerged on the total scores.

3. Results 

SSQ scores across VR experimental conditions can be seen in Fig. 1B. 

A significant reduction in nausea on the SSQ scale was observed in the copernic360-

VR  (6-degrees-of-freedom  VR)  condition  compared  to  standard360-VR  (3-degrees-of-

freedom VR) (t (24) = 2.17, p = .04, Cohen’s d = 0.44). Participants reported fewer symptoms 

of nausea in the copernic360-VR condition (M = 18.32, SD = 19.65) compared to standard360-

VR (M = 27.48, SD = 24.22). There were no significant differences between VR conditions on 

the oculomotor (t (24) = .128; p = .90, Cohen’s d = 0.02) and disorientation (t (24)= .929; p = 

.36, Cohen’s d = 0.19) dimensions of the SSQ. No differences between 6-degrees-of-freedom 

VR and 3-degrees-of-freedom VR conditions emerged in the SSQ total scores (t (24) =1.12, 

p = .28, Cohen’s d = 0.23). 

FMS scores across VR experimental conditions can be seen in Table 1.  FMS scores 

showed no significant effect of VR condition on average FMS rating (F (1, 24) = .32, p = .58, 

np2 = .013).  However, there was a significant main effect of time (F (1.34, 32.18) = 23.64, p 

<.001, np2=.50).  No interaction emerged between VR condition and time (F (1.42, 34.06) = 

.52, p = .60, ηp2 = .02).  Post-hoc Bonferroni tests showed that During-VR average FMS rating 

(M= 3.08, SE= .62) was significantly higher than Pre-VR FMS rating (M=.20, SE= .11) (t (24) 

= 5.38, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.08) across VR conditions.  There was no differences between 

During-VR and Post-VR FMS ratings (t (24) = -0.86, p = .17).  Post-VR FMS rating (M=3.34, 

SE= .72) was higher than Pre-VR FMS rating (t (24) = 4.99, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1).  A similar 

analysis  performed  on  peak  FMS  scores  during  VR  revealed  no  significant  effect  of  VR 

condition when peak FMS ratings were used (F (1, 24) = .77, p = .39, np2 = .031).  There was 

a significant effect of time on FMS peak ratings (F (1.58, 38.01) = 39.65, p<.001, np2 .62).  

There was no significant interaction between VR condition and time (F (2, 48) = .67, p = .52, 

ηp2 = .03).  Follow-up testing using Bonferroni correction showed that During-VR peak FMS 

rating (M=5.38, SE= .75) was significantly higher than Pre-VR FMS rating (M=.20, SE= .11) (t 

(24) = 7.61, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.52) across VR conditions. During-VR peak FMS rating 

was higher than Post-VR FMS rating (M=3.34, SE= .72) (t (24) = 4.92, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 

12 

 
0.98). Post-VR FMS rating was higher compared to Pre-VR FMS ratings (t (24) = 4.99, p < 

.001,  Cohen’s  d  =  1).  The  increase  in  FMS  ratings  indicates  increased  cybersickness 

symptoms over time. However, this increase was equally present across standard360-VR (3-

degrees-of-freedom VR) and copernic360-VR (6-degrees-of-freedom VR) conditions. 

HR values across VR experimental conditions can be seen in Table 2. There was no 

significant effect of VR condition (3-degrees-of-freedom VR vs 6-degrees-of-freedom VR) on 

average heart rate measures (F (1, 24) = 1.23, p = .28, ηp2 = .05).  A significant main effect 

of  time  (F  (1.38,  33.19)  =  4.22,  p  =.036,  ηp2=  .15)  emerged.  There  was  no  significant 

interaction between VR condition and time (F (2, 48) = 1.13, p = .33, ηp2 = .05).  Post-hoc 

Bonferroni tests revealed that Post-VR HR measures (M=102.28, SE= 2.95) were higher than 

During-VR average HR measures (t (24) = 2.54, p = .02, Cohen’s d = 0.51). No differences 

emerged between During-VR average HR measures (M= 98.33, SE= 2.28) and Pre-VR HR 

measures (M=96.14, SE= 2.83) (t (24) = 1.12, p = .27), and between Post-VR HR measures 

(M=102.28,  SE=  2.95)  and  Pre-VR  heart  rate  measures  (t  (24)  =  2.24,  p  =  .04).    A  similar 

analysis performed on peak HR values during VR revealed no significant effect of VR condition 

when peak HR values were used (F (1, 24) = 1.66, p = .21, np2 = .065).  There was a significant 

effect of time on HR peak values (F (2, 48) = 19.74, p<.001, np2 .45).  There was no significant 

interaction between VR condition and time (F (2, 48) = .37, p = .70, ηp2 = .02).  Follow-up 

testing using Bonferroni correction showed that During-VR the peak HR measures (M= 111.3, 

SE= 2.45) was significantly higher compared to both Pre-VR HR measures (M=96.14, SE= 

2.83) (t (24) = 7.24, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.45) and Post-VR HR measures (M=102.28, SE= 

2.95) (t (24) = 3.75, p = .001, Cohen’s d = 0.75). Post-VR HR measures were no different from 

Pre-VR  HR  measures  (t  (24)  =  2.24,  p  =  .04).    Although  heart  rate  increased  during  VR 

exposure, no differences emerged between standard360-VR (3-degrees-of-freedom VR) and 

copernic360-VR (6-degrees-of-freedom VR) conditions.

Despite the improvements in VR hardware, cybersickness is a predominant factor affecting 

VR experience and feeling of immersion.  The mismatch between visuo-vestibular cues can 

induce compelling feelings of nausea and discomfort.  In this study, we focused on a particular 

VR experience in which videos are captured using omnidirectional cameras which enable the 

filming of an entire 360 degrees scene.  In 360-degree VR the user is able to look and move 

around  the  entire  scene.    However,  360-degree  VR  only  supports  3-degrees-of-freedom 

rotational motion, which might easily conflict with the level of precise information transmitted 

by the vestibular organs as soon as the user moves their head. That is, traditional 360-degree 

VR  is  a  unique  setting  offering  minimal  dynamic  visual  inputs  combined  with  a  flow  of 

translational vestibular inputs. Here we investigated whether cybersickness in 360-degree VR 

can be reduced by a novel AI-based software (copernic360).  Both explicit (simulator sickness 

questionnaire and fast motion sickness rating) and implicit (heart rate) measures were used 

to quantify the changes in cybersickness. Our results showed a significant reduction in nausea 

symptoms  on  the  Simulator  Sickness  Questionnaire  (Kennedy  et  al.,  1993)  when  using 

copernic360-VR  compared  to  traditional  360-degree  VR.    Importantly,  the  oculomotor  and 

disorientation dimensions were not significantly different between VR conditions.  However, 

the significant reduction in nausea symptoms demonstrates the potential of the copernic360-

VR  software  in  improving  the  VR  experience.    As  anticipated,  we  observed  an  increase  in 

motion sickness ratings and heart rate towards the end of VR exposure.  While there were no 

significant differences between the copernic360 VR and traditional 360-degree VR conditions 

for these measures, the increase appears more marginal in copernic360-VR. 

Cybersickness  has  been  often  assessed  via  subjective  self-reports.    The  Simulator 

Sickness  Questionnaire  (Kennedy et  al.,  1993)  is  probably  the  most  frequently  used.    This 

questionnaire  breaks  down  motion  sickness  symptoms  into  three  main  categories: 

disorientation  (including  dizziness,  vertigo  and  difficulty  focusing),  oculomotor  (eyestrain, 

headache,  and  blurred  vision)  and  nausea  (stomach  awareness,  increased  salivation,  and 

15 

 
nausea  itself).    In  typical  VR  scenarios  in  which  the  user  is  experiencing  vection  while 

vestibular  cues  are  signaling  zero  angular  or  translational  acceleration,  cybersickness  is 

characterised  by  a  D>N>O  profile  in  which  the  most  severe  and  frequent  symptoms  are 

observed in the disorientation domain, followed by nausea symptoms, and least oculomotor 

symptoms (Rebenitsch and Owen, 2016; Stanney et al., 2003).  This pattern of symptoms has 

been explained by a sensory mismatch between visual and vestibular cues in VR which may 

lead to difficulties in forming and updating spatial maps of the external virtual environment and 

the organism (Lackner and DiZio, 2005), leaving the VR user disoriented.  Similar to previous 

studies,  here  we  observed  an  overall  D>N>O  profile  across  experimental  conditions 

(standard360-VR  and  copernic360-VR).    Although  copernic360-VR  numerically  reduced 

sickness  scores  of  disorientation,  nausea  and  oculomotor  symptoms,  it  only  significantly 

improves the nauseogenic aspect of the 360-degree VR experience. Importantly, nausea is 

consistently  experienced  in  360-degree  settings  (Gavgani  et  al.,  2017)  and  it  has  been 

associated with significant user drop out (Balk et al., 2013; Ehrlich and Kolasinski, 1998).  The 

congruency between visual and vestibular signals induced by the copernic360-VR technology 

allowed  for  a  reduction  in  self-reported  nausea  in  the  current  study.  Reducing  this  key 

symptom allows for a more immersive and interactive virtual experience.  This new technology 

may  offer  an  alternative  to  physical  setups,  artificial  stimulation  and  sensory  habituation 

protocols (Ng et al., 2020). 

Importantly, the scores obtained in the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (Kennedy et 

al.,  1993)  for  the  standard  360-degree  VR  condition  are  comparable  to  previous  studies.  

Nausea levels have been reported ranging from 14.91 to 30.21, oculomotor symptoms varied 

from  15.30  to  25.74,  and  disorientation  was  reported  markedly  higher  from  21.75  to  41.47 

(Ehrlich et al., 1998; Kolasinski and Gilson, 1998; Stanney and Kennedy, 1998).  The current 

VR  experience  was  characterised  by  a  similar  level  of  nauseogenicity.  However,  several 

factors influence cybersickness symptoms, and direct comparison between studies might not 

be straightforward. Not surprisingly, people susceptible to motion sickness are more likely to 

experience  cybersickness  (Rebenitsch  and  Owen,  2014).  Symptom  severity  and  incidence 

16 

 
 
increases with age (Arns et al., 2005). Some studies have indicated that females are more 

susceptible to cybersickness than males (Curry et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). Further, the 

technical characteristics of the VR equipment such as the weight of the headset as well as the 

VR environment might play a key role.  

We measured cybersickness self-reports and heart rate variability during VR exposure.  

The fast motion sickness scale provides continuous data and measures of sickness during the 

presentation of a sickness-inducing situation, not necessary cybersickness (Keshavarz and 

Hecht, 2011).  As expected, we observed an increase in cybersickness scores over the ten 

minutes  of  VR  exposure.    However,  the  scores  were  not  significantly  influenced  by  the 

copernic360-VR  technology.    It  is  important  to  note  that  fast  motion  sickness  scores  were 

overall very low and several participants never rated above zero.  Our VR scenario consisted 

of  a  realistic  beach  scene  accompanied  with  the  soft  sound  of  waves.  While  a  multimodal 

exposure to visual and audio cues in VR may have increased a sense of presence typically 

leading  to  more  sickness  discomfort  (Cooper  et  al.,  2018;  Kim  et  al.,  2014),  the  calming 

content of our scenario may have masked feelings of cybersickness (Amores et al., 2018). 

Accordingly, emotional and physical discomfort have been related to the Simulator Sickness 

Questionnaire  measures  (Somrak  et  al.,  2019).  This  might  suggest  that  the  VR  scenario 

developed for this experiment was not particularly sickness-inducing, or more in general 360 

VR is not as challenging as traditional VR.  That is, the content of the VR may have reduced 

or counteracted against feelings of cybersickness.  Further, the VR exposure is markedly less 

disorientating  when  compared  to  rollercoaster  or  first-person  shooter  scenarios.    This  may 

also explain the lack of significance found on the SSQ-D.  Lastly, the duration of VR exposure 

could be extended. Increased duration has been associated with cybersickness (Moss and 

Muth, 2011) with 10-20 mins of exposure leading to cybersickness (Häkkinen et al., 2019). 

Future studies should consider using a more conflicting VR scenario involving longer duration 

and  dynamic  movements.  For  instance,  one  could  use  a  motion  platform  to  dynamically 

change the tilt of the floor paired with a 360-degree video from aboard a ship. A longer duration 

17 

 
with greater mismatch might allow the benefits of 6-degrees-of-freedom VR to be tested more 

thoroughly.  

While  some  studies  have  reported  an  increased  heart  rate  in  VR  (Nalivaiko  et  al., 

2015), others report conflicting findings. For instance, when participants were exposed to VR 

across three days, there were no significant differences found in heart rate measures (Gavgani 

et  al.,  2017).  This  might  suggest  a  form  of  habituation  when  participants  are  repeatedly 

exposed to VR over a period of time, which may have happened in our experiment.  An effect 

of coperic-360-VR on heart rate measure of sickness during VR could have been potentially 

masked  by  the  content  of  the  VR  scenario  (Guna  et  al.,  2020).  We  cannot  exclude  that 

participants may have also adapted to the walking pattern, perhaps influencing the saliency of 

vestibular  cues  during  the  VR  which  might  have  in  turn  reduced  sensory  conflict  and 

cybersickness. Along with diversifying the walking pattern to reduce the effects of habituation, 

more  interaction  with  the  virtual  environment  could  be  encouraged.  Increased  interaction 

through  grasping  movement  or  changes  in  head  movement  may  induce  greater  mismatch 

between  visual  and  vestibular  cues  leading  to  cybersickness.  Thus,  future  studies  should 

consider  integrating  head  movements  to  increase  the  disorientation  effects  of  VR  and  the 

benefits of 6-degrees-of-freedom VR compared to 3-degrees-of-freedom VR. 

When  considering  the  benefits  of  copernic360-VR,  only  self-reported  nausea  was 

found  to  differ  statistically.  Nausea  symptoms  are  one  of  the  most  challenging  aspects  of 

cybersickness.  Importantly,  our  results  showed  that  copernic360  significantly  reduced  the 

feeling  of  nausea.  No  differences  were  found  in  the  other  sickness  domains  as  well  as  in 

physiological measures. Using a more conflicting VR scenario for an extended period of time 

is  recommended.  As  far  as  we  are  aware,  no  other  approaches  have  implemented  an  AI-

based 6-degrees-of-freedom technology to reduce cybersickness. Here, we offer new insights 

into  its  benefits  and  encourage  future  studies  to  explore  the  components  of  3-degrees-of-

freedom VR vs 6-degrees-of-freedom VR experiences.  

As VR continues to improve, more needs to be done to combat the unwanted effects 

of  cybersickness.  This  study  demonstrated  the  potential  of  a  novel  AI-based  software  to 

18 

 
increase  the  congruency  between  visual  and  vestibular  cues.    Crucially,  feelings  of  self-

reported nausea were reduced implying weakened feelings of cybersickness. Reducing the 

nausea  and  discomfort  perceived  by  individuals  is  crucial  in  allowing  the  application  and 

further utility of VR in educational, medicinal, cultural and entertainment settings.
