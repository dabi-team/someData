where 0 < µ < 3, ε is a positive parameter, V, Q are two continuous real function on R3 and G is the
primitive of g which is of critical growth due to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. Under suitable
assumptions on g, we ﬁrst establish the existence of ground states for the critical Choquard equation with
constant coeﬃcients. Next we establish existence and multiplicity of semi-classical solutions and characterize
the concentration behavior by variational methods.

where N
3, 0 < µ < N , arises in many interesting physical situations in quantum theory and plays an
important role in the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation where it accounts for the ﬁnite-range many-body
interactions. For N = 3, p = 2 and µ = 1, it was investigated by Pekar in [29] to study the quantum theory
of a polaron at rest. In [19], Choquard applied it as approximation to Hartree-Fock theory of one-component
plasma. This equation was also proposed by Penrose in [23] as a model of selfgravitating matter and is
known in that context as the Schr¨odinger-Newton equation. For a complete and updated discussion upon
the current literature of such problems, we refer the interested reader to the guide [28]. We also mention [14],
where the fractional case is treated.

In the present paper we are interested in the existence, multiplicity and concentration behavior of the

semi-classical solutions of the singularly perturbed nonlocal elliptic equation

where 0 < µ < 3, ε is a positive parameter, V , Q are real continuous functions on R3. As ε goes to zero
in (1.1), the existence and asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the singularly perturbed equation (1.1) is
known as the semi-classical problem. It was used to describe the transition between of Quantum Mechanics
and classical Mechanics. For the local Schr¨odinger equation

ε2∆u + V (x)u = g(u)

in RN ,

−

it goes back to the pioneer work [15] by Floer and Weinstein. Since then, it has been studied extensively
under various hypotheses on the potential and the nonlinearity, see for example [6,13,15,17,30–32,34] and the
references therein. Particularly, the existence and concentration of solutions for local Schr¨odinger equation
with critical exponent was investigated in [1, 9, 12, 38]. For a Schr¨odinger equation of the form

Wang and Zeng [35] proved that the concentration points are located on the middle ground of the competing
potential functions and in some cases are given explicitly in terms of these functions. Cingolani and Lazzo [10]
obtained a multiplicity result involving the set of global minima of a function which provides some kind of
global median value between the minimum of V and the maximum of K and Q. We also mention the paper [7]
by Ambrosetti, Malchiodi and Secchi where the authors considered the case Q = 0. Among other results, they
proved that the number of solutions of (1.2) is related with the set of minima of a function given explicitly
in terms of V, K, r, and the dimension N . Ding and Liu [13] considered

plays the role of limit equation in the study of the semiclassical problems. To apply the Lyapunov-Schmidt
reduction techniques, it relies a lot on the uniqueness and non-degeneracy of the ground states of the limit
problem which is not completely known for the ground states of the nonlocal Choquard equation (1.3). There
is a considerable amount of work on investigating the properties of this type equation. We refer to Lieb [19]

Recently, by using the method of moving planes, Ma and Zhao [22] proved that all the positive solutions of
equation (1.4) must be radially symmetric and monotone decreasing about some ﬁxed point. Which means
that the positive solution of equation (1.4) is uniquely determined up to translations. Especially, they studied
the classiﬁcation of all positive solutions to the generalized nonlinear Choquard problem

under the assumption of Berestycki-Lions type and studied the existence of solutions for the nonlocal equation
with lower critical exponent due to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. For N = 3, µ = 1 and F (s) =
2, the uniqueness and non-degeneracy of the ground states were proved in Lenzmann, Wei and Winter
s
|
in [21, 33]. Wei and Winter also constructed families of solutions by a Lyapunov-Schmidt type reduction
when inf V > 0 and Q(x) = 1. Cingolani et.al. [11] applied the penalization arguments due to Byeon and
Jeanjean [8] and showed that there exists a family of solutions having multiple concentration regions which are
p < 2N −µ
located around the minimum points of the potential. For any N
N −2
in (1.1), Moroz and Van Schaftingen in [26] developed a nonlocal penalization technique and showed that
equation (1.1) has a family of solutions concentrating around the local minimum of V with V satisfying
some additional assumptions at inﬁnity.
In [4, 5], Alves and Yang proved the existence, multiplicity and
concentration of solutions for the equation by penalization method and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. The
planar case was considered by [3], where the authors ﬁrst established the existence of ground state for the limit
problem with critical exponential growth and then studied the concentration around the global minimum set.

Thus (6
µ is the upper critical exponent due to the
Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, we also recall that 6 is critical Sobolev exponent for dimension 3. As
to the best knowledge of us, the existing results for the existence and concentration behavior of solutions
for the Choquard equation were obtained under the subcritical growth assumption, namely t < 6
µ. It is
then quite natural to ask if the nonlinearity g(u) in equation (1.3) is of upper critical growth in the sense
of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, does the ground state solution still exist? Furthermore, can we
establish the existence and multiplicity results for the singular perturbed critical Choquard equation (1.1) and
characterize the concentration phenomena around the minimum set of linear potential V (x) or the maximum
set of the nonlinear potential Q(x)? In the present paper we are going to answer the above questions and
to investigate the existence, multiplicity and the concentration behavior of the solutions of the Choquard
equation with critical exponent due to the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality.

admits a ground state solution.

Remark 1.4. As observed for the local Schr¨odinger equation, the subcritical perturbation is necessary to
secure the existence of a nontrivial solution. Note that if f (u) = 0 and u is a solution, we can establish the
following P ohoˇzaev identity

The following is a comparison result for the mountain pass values with diﬀerent parameters κ, ν, τ > 0,

Proof. From Theorem 1.3, let u be a weak solution of problem (1.7) with coeﬃcients κ2, ν2, τ2 at the energy
level Φκ2,ν2,τ2(u) = mκ2,ν2,τ2. By (f3), we know there is a unique t = t(u) > 0 such that

Φκ2,ν2,τ2(su),

Since u

Φκ2,ν2,τ2(u) = max

Φκ2,ν2,τ2(tu).

Similarly, there exists t0 > 0 such that Φκ1,ν1,τ1(t0u) = maxt≥0 Φκ1,ν1,τ1(tu). Then

εnzεn = y0, therefore lim

point of of vεj = uεj (x + yεj ). Consequently, εjzεj −
bεj lies in a ball BR(0). From Lemma 4.4, there is a positive solution for (SCC1) for ε > 0 small enough.
Therefore, the function wε(x) = uε( x
ε ) is a positive solution of (1.8). Thus, the maximum points xε and
zε of wε and uε respectively, satisfy the equality xε = εzε. Setting vε(x) := wε(εx + xε), for any sequence

6. Existence and multiplicity

In this section, we are going to prove the existence and multiplicity of solutions. First we have the following

existence result.

Theorem 6.1 (Existence of ground states). Suppose that the nonlinearity f satisﬁes (f1)-(f3) and the
potential function V (x) satisﬁes condition (V ). Then, there exists ε0 > 0 such that problem (SCC2) has a
positive ground state solution uε, for all ε < ε0.

SINGULARLY PERTURBED CRITICAL CHOQUARD EQUATIONS

Proof. It is easy to check that Jε also satisﬁes the Mountain Pass geometry. Let

mε := inf

u∈E\{0}

max
t≥0

Jε(tu) = inf

Jε(u).

Then, we know there exists a (P S) sequence at mε, i.e.,

and Jε(un)

→

Thus, by Lemma 5.3, if mε < mκ∞,1,1, then the existence of ground state solution is guaranteed. In what
follows, we ﬁx γ > 0 and Ψγ ∈

0 (R3) such that

By a direct computation,

Therefore, there is ε0 > 0 such that mε < mκ∞,1,1 for all ε

γ < mκ∞,1,1.
