ABSTRACT
This paper focuses on NGC 454, a nearby interacting pair of galaxies (AM0112-554,
RR23), composed of an early-type (NGC 454 E) and a star forming late-type compan-
ion (NGC 454 W). We aim at characterizing this wet merger candidate via a multi-λ
analysis, from near-UV to optical using SWIFT–UVOT, and mapping the Hα intensity
(I) distribution, velocity (Vr), and velocity dispersion (σ) ﬁelds with SAM+Perot-
Fabry@SOAR observations. Luminosity proﬁles suggest that NGC 454 E is an S0.
Distortions in its outskirts caused by the on-going interaction are visible in both op-
tical and near-UV frames. In NGC 454 W, the NUV-UVOT images and the Hα show a
set of star forming complexes connected by a faint tail. Hα emission is detected along
the line connecting NGC 454 E to the NGC 454 main H ii complex. We investigate
the (I − σ), (I − Vr) (Vr − σ) diagnostic diagrams of the H ii complexes, most of which
can be interpreted in a framework of expanding bubbles. In the main H ii complex,
enclosed in the UV brightest region, the gas velocity dispersion is highly supersonic
reaching 60 km s−1. However, Hα emission proﬁles are mostly asymmetric indicat-
ing the presence of multiple components with an irregular kinematics. Observations
point towards an advanced stage of the encounter. Our SPH simulations with chemo-
photometric implementation suggest that this mixed pair can be understood in terms
of a 1:1 gas/halos encounter giving rise to a merger in about 0.2 Gyr from the present
stage.

1 INTRODUCTION

Interactions modify the gravitational potential of the in-
volved galaxies and may lead to their merger. During the
interaction the stellar and gas components of each galaxy
respond diﬀerently to the potential variation. The outcome
is directly measurable in terms of morphology, kinematics
and, in general, of the physical properties of each galaxy,
such as their star formation rate and AGN activity. A com-
prehensive description of the job of interactions in shaping
galaxies and their properties as investigated in last decades

of extragalactic research is widely presented and discussed
by Struck (2011, and references therein).

Pairs of galaxies have been used as probes to study
interactions. Well-selected samples of pairs and catalogues
have been produced (see e.g. Karachentsev 1972; Peterson
1979; Rampazzo et al. 1995; Soares et al. 1995; Barton
2000). Single studies as well as surveys of pair catalogues
have been crucial to reveal several interaction eﬀects once
compared to isolated/unperturbed galaxy samples (see e.g.
Rampazzo et al. 2016, Section 5.3.2).

Although the vast majority of pair members have sim-
ilar morphological types, a ﬁrst light on the existence of
mixed morphology pairs has been shed by the Karachent-
sev (1972) Catalog of Isolated Pairs. Rampazzo & Sulentic
(1992) estimated that between as much as 10-25% of the
pairs in any complete (non-hierarchical) sample will be of the
mixed morphology type. At the beginning of 1990s, studies
about this kind of pairs were addressed to ascertain possi-
ble enhancement of the star formation activity, with respect

to non interacting samples, via mid and far infrared obser-
vations, at that time often hampered by a low resolution
(see e.g. Xu & Sulentic 1991; Surace 1993). Mixed morphol-
ogy pairs have been thought as the cleanest systems where
to verify possible mass transfer between the gas rich and
the gas poor member, typically the early-type companion.
Several candidates of mixed morphology pairs with star for-
mation and AGN activity, fueled by gas transfer between
components, have been indicated (see e.g. de Mello et al.
1995; Rampazzo et al. 1995; deMello et al. 1996; Domingue
et al. 2003). The literature reports in general a star forma-
tion enhancement in wet and mixed pairs (see e. g. Larson
& Tinsley 1978; Combes et al. 1994; Barton 2000; Barton
et al. 2003; Smith et al 2007; Knapen & Querejeta 2015;
Smith et al. 2016).

The fate of mixed, gravitationally bound pairs is to
merge, the available gas may trigger star formation for some
time, but it is still unclear what will be the merger product.
The role of mixed merger has been investigated by Lin et
al. (2008) who suggested that roughly 36% of the present
day red galaxies, typically early-type galaxies, have expe-
rienced a mixed merger. According to these authors mixed
(and wet) mergers will produce red galaxies of intermediate
mass, after the quenching of the star formation, while the
more massive part of the red sequence should be generated
by stellar mass growth via dry-mergers (VanDokkum 2005;
Faber et al. 2007).

In the context of star formation, the dynamics of the
(ionized, neutral and molecular) gas clouds during interac-
tion is a crucial topic. H I bridges as well as clouds larger
than 108 M(cid:12) are detected in wet interacting/merging pairs
with 20-40 km s−1 velocity dispersion (see e.g. Elmegreen
et al. 1993; Irwin 1994; Elmegreen et al. 1995). External
gas high velocity dispersion is possibly linked to an internal
high velocity dispersion of the clouds, increasing the star
formation eﬃciency. Combes et al. (1994) suggest that the
enhancement of the star formation in wet interacting galax-
ies may be connected to an increase of the molecular gas
that inﬂows toward the center by tidal torque. There are in-
dication that the brightness distribution of H II regions in in-
teracting objects diﬀers from unperturbed ones. Bright H II
regions can form by gas ﬂows during interaction. They are
on the average brighter than in isolated galaxies and have a
high internal velocity dispersion (15-20 km s−1) as reported
by Zaragoza-Cardiel et al. (2015). Furthermore, the number
of H II regions in interacting objects is bigger than in an iso-
lated galaxies with the same absolute magnitude, suggesting
that interactions do in fact increase the star formation rate.
The subject of the present study is the NGC 454 sys-
tem, a strongly peculiar, interacting (AM 0112-554; Arp &
Madore 1987) and isolated Reduzzi & Rampazzo (RR23;
1995) pair in the Southern Hemisphere. Johansson (1988)
described the system as “a pair of emission-line galaxies in
close interaction, or in the early-stage of a merger, consisting
of a large elliptical and a blue irregular galaxy”. Figure 1 dis-
sects the system according the regions labeled by Johansson
(1988) and Stiavelli et al. (1998). We will adopt their deﬁ-
nition along this paper adding the preﬁx NGC 454.

The East part of the system, (labeled E in Figure 1,
NGC 454 E hereafter), identiﬁes the early-type member of
the pair. NGC 454 E is crossed by dust lanes and it is dis-
torted by the interaction. The U, B, V Johnson and Gunn I

photometry by Johansson (1988) presented the East mem-
ber as a red elliptical with a luminosity proﬁle that follows
closely an r1/4 law (de Vaucouleurs 1948) out to 15(cid:48)(cid:48) from
the galaxy center. The Stiavelli et al. (1998) high resolution
HST imaging, in the F450W, F606W, and F814W ﬁlters,
shows that NGC 454 E is likely an S0. Their luminosity pro-
ﬁle, extending out to (cid:39) 30(cid:48)(cid:48), is much better ﬁtted by two
components: an r1/4 law describing the bulge plus an expo-
nential law (Freeman 1970) for a disk. The (B-V) color pro-
ﬁle indicates that the central part of the galaxy, i.e. r≤1(cid:48)(cid:48), is
red with 1(cid:46) (B-V) (cid:46)1.4 while the outside region is slightly
bluer with 0.8(cid:46) (B-V) (cid:46)1. The nucleus of NGC 454 E, ob-
served spectroscopically by Johansson (1988), revealed sev-
eral emission lines and matched two of the empirical crite-
ria proposed by Shuder & Osterbrock (1981) for a Seyfert
galaxy: the line-width of Hα is larger than 300 km s−1 and
the [OIII]λ5007˚A/Hβ ratio is larger than 3. However, none
of the high-excitation lines expected in this case, as HeII,
were detected (see also Donzelli & Pastoriza 2000; Tanvuia
et al. 2003). The AGN type of the nucleus has been re-
cently detailed by Marchese et al. (2012). Their analysis of
SWIFT, XMM-Netwon and Suzaku observations character-
izes the NGC454 E nucleus as a “changing look” AGN. This
is a class of AGN showing signiﬁcant variation of the ab-
sorbing column density along the line of sight.

The West region of the pair labeled in Figure 1 as W
(NGC 454 W hereafter) has been considered by Johansson
(1988) as the debris of an irregular galaxy. However, the
galaxy is so widely distorted by the on-going interaction
that the classiﬁcation is diﬃcult. Stiavelli et al. (1998) sug-
gested that it is the debris of a disk galaxy. NGC 454 W is
a starburst galaxy, as shown by the Hα image of Johansson
(1988, their Figure 6a and 6b). The spectrum of NGC 454 W
shows emission lines whose ratios, according to the above
authors, are due to photo-ionization by star formation and
shock heating.

The NGC 454 E region is particularly distorted in the
North-West side. This region, label as T (NGC 454 T here-
after) in Figure 1, has been studied by Stiavelli et al. (1998)
which found this is composed by a mix of the stellar popu-
lations of the NGC 454 E and the NGC 454 W. Moreover,
they found a similarity between the color of NGC 454 T re-
gion and that of the nearby sky and speculated about the
presence of a faint tail of stripped material in this region not
detected by the HST observations.

The picture of the NGC 454 system is completed
by three blue knots, NGC 454 SW, NGC 454 SE and
NGC 454 S, well detached from NGC 454 E, and likely con-
nected to NGC 454 W (Johansson 1988; Stiavelli et al. 1998).
Johansson (1988) suggested that these are newly formed
globular clusters of 3×106 M(cid:12) and 1-5×107 years stellar
age. Recently several investigations suggest that young in-
dependent stellar systems at z (cid:39) 0 start to form in tidal
debris (see e.g. review by Lelli et al. 2015).

Table 1 summarizes some basic characteristics of
NGC 454 E and W which appear as a prototype of an en-
counter/merger (∆Vhel=1±2 km s−1 Tanvuia et al. (2003))
between a late and an early-type galaxy, this latter having an
active and peculiar Seyfert-like nucleus. Therefore, the study
of this system can make progresses in our understanding of
the eﬀects of a wet interaction.

Our contribution consists of two correlated pieces of ob-

(Morrissay et al. 2007, GALEX) showed the strength of UV
observations in revealing rejuvenation episodes in otherwise
old stellar systems (see e.g. Rampazzo et al. 2007; Marino et
al. 2011; Rampazzo et al. 2011, and references therein). In
this context, we investigate the Near UV (NUV hereafter)
stellar structure of the NGC 454 system using Swift UVOT
UV images (see also Rampazzo et al. 2017, and references
therein). In order to study the ionized gas, connected to the
ongoing star formation, we use the SOAR Adaptive Module
(SAM) coupled with a Fabry-Perot to investigate its distri-
bution, the 2D velocity and velocity dispersion ﬁelds of the
Hα emission in NGC 454 W and in NGC 454 SW and SE
stellar complexes, likely debris of NGC 454 W. We ﬁnally
attempt to derive the parameters and the merger history of
the system using simulations.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we
present SWIFT-UVOT (§ 2.1) and the SAM+Fabry-Perot
(§ 2.2) observations of NGC 454 and the reduction tech-

2 OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION

2.1 SWIFT-UVOT observations

UVOT is a 30 cm telescope in the SWIFT platform operat-
ing both in imaging and spectroscopy modes (Roming et al.
2005). We mined the UVOT archive in the ASDC-ASI Science
Data Center retrieving the 00035244003 product including
images of the NGC 454 system in all six ﬁlters available. Ta-
ble 3 gives the characteristics of these ﬁlters and calibrations
are discussed in Breeveld et al. (2010, 2011).

The archival UVOT un-binned images have a scale of
0.(cid:48)(cid:48)5/pixel. Images were processed using the procedure de-
scribed in http://www.swift.ac.uk/analysis/uvot/. All
the images taken in the same ﬁlter are combined in a single
image using UVOTSUM to improve the S/N and to enhance the
visibility of NUV features of low surface brightness. The ﬁ-
nal data set of the U V W 2, U V M 2, U V W 1, U , B, V images
have total exposure times reported in Table 3.

UVOT is a photon counting instrument and, as such, is
subject to coincidence loss when the throughput is high,

whether due to background or source counts, which may
result in an undercounting of the ﬂux aﬀecting the brightness
of the source. Count rates less than 0.01 counts s−1 pixel−1
are aﬀected by at most 1% and count rate less than 0.1
counts s−1 pixel−1 by at most 12% due to coincidence loss
(Breeveld et al. 2011, their Figure 6).

Coincidence loss eﬀects can be corrected in the case
of point sources (Poole et al. 2008; Breeveld et al. 2010).
For extended sources a correction process has been per-
formed for NGC 4449, a Magellanic-type irregular galaxy
with bright star forming regions, by Karczewski et al. (2013).
Even though their whole ﬁeld is aﬀected, the authors calcu-
late that the statistical and systematic uncertainties in their
total ﬂuxes amount to ≈ 7-9% overall, for the NUV and the
optical bands.

We checked, indeed, that in UV ﬁlters the coincidence
losses may involve only few central pixels of the Irr galaxy,
i.e., NGC 454 W, never exceeding 0.1 count s−1 px−1 (in par-
ticular, the maximum value of the count rates is 0.043, 0.028,
and 0.047 count s−1 px−1 in U V W 2, U V M 2 and U V W 1 ﬁl-
ters respectively). Our NUV images are very slightly aﬀected
so we decided do not account for this eﬀect. Optical images
are more aﬀected. In the NGC 454 W region the eﬀect re-
mains ≤ 0.1 count s−1 px−1 in all the bands, in particular
it reaches 0.09, , 0.08, and 0.096 count s−1 px−1 in the U , B
and V ﬁlters respectively. As far as NGC 454 E is concerned,
in the U ﬁlter count rates are at most 0.084 count s−1 px−1,
and reach 0.2 in the B and V bands in the inner 5(cid:48)(cid:48). So, we
add to the photometric error in Table 3 a further error of
12% in optical bands to account for this eﬀect.

We compared our total magnitudes in Table 3 with
Prugniel & H´eraudeau (1998) which reported a total mag-
nitude B=13.32±0.05 and 13.44±0.064, respectively for the
whole NGC 454 system and for NGC 454 W. Once our mea-
sures are scaled to the Vega system (B=B[AB]+0.139) we
have B=13.43±0.15 and B=13.65±0.12, in very good agree-
ment with previous estimates.

Our (B − V ) color, integrated within a 31(cid:48)(cid:48) aperture
and corrected for galactic absorption for NGC 454 E and
NGC 454 W is 0.88±0.11 and 0.48±0.06, respectively, to be
compared with 0.80 and 0.32 from Johansson (1988).

2.2 Fabry-Perot observation

Fabry-Perot (FP hereafter) observations1 have been carried
out on Sept 30th 2016 as part of the SAM-FP Early Sci-
ence run at SOAR 4.1m telescope at Cerro Pachon (Chile).
SAM-FP is a new instrument, available at SOAR, combining
the adaptative optics SAM (Tokovinin et al. 2010a,b) and a
scanning Queensgate ET70 Etalon (Mendes de Oliveira et
al. 2017). The SAM module has been conceived to deliver
a 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)35 angular resolution across a 3(cid:48)×3(cid:48) FoV, depending on
atmospheric condition, using Ground Layer Adaptive Op-
tics (GLAO). The SAM instrument detector is a 4K×4K
CCD with a scale image scale of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)0454 (physical pixel of
15µ) on the sky (Fraga et al. 2013). The present observa-
tions have been binned over 4×4 pixels resulting in a scale
of 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)18/px. The interferometer used is a ET70 Queensgate

1 All Fabry-Perot data (cubes and moment maps) are available
at cesam.lam.fr/fabryperot/

scanning FP with an order of p=609@Hα. The FP piezos are
driven by a CS100 controller, positioned at the telescope. Ta-
ble 2 gives the journal of observation with the characteristic
of the etalon we used. At the center of the Free Spectral
Range we adopt the systemic velocity of 3645 km s−1 pro-
vided by NED (see also Donzelli & Pastoriza 2000; Tanvuia
et al. 2003, as more recent and independent sources).

Data have been reduced using home made Python
macros to handle Multi Extension Files from SAM and
building the data cube, some IRAF2 speciﬁc tasks and Ad-
hocw 3 software procedures have been used to handle the
cube. The data reduction procedure has been extensively
described by Amram et al. (1996) and Epinat et al. (2008).
The ﬁrst step, before the phase correction, is to perform the
standard CCD data reduction by applying bias and ﬂat-ﬁeld
corrections under IRAF as well as the cosmic removal using
L.A.cosmic procedure (van Dokkum 2001). Linear combi-
nations of dark images have been used to removed CCD
patterns in diﬀerent frames.

In addition to these canonical operations, it is necessary
to check and correct for several eﬀects, such as, misalignment
of data cube frames (due to bad guiding), sky transparency
variation throughout the cube, and seeing variation. Mis-
alignment variation across the 43 frames of the data cube
is less than half pixel, thus it is negligible. The sky trans-
parency has been corrected using a star in the FoV. It varies
between 81% to 98% during the observation: each frame has
been corrected accordingly using one channel as a reference.
The same star is also used to map the corrected seeing varia-
tion ranging from 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)71 to 0.(cid:48)(cid:48)90. We then applied a 2D spatial
Gaussian smoothing equivalent to the worse estimated cor-
rected seeing (0.(cid:48)(cid:48)90). Phase map and phase correction have
been performed using the Adhocw package and by scanning
of the narrow Ne 6599˚A line under the same observing con-
ditions. The velocities measured are very accurate compared
to the systemic velocity in Table 1, with an error of a frac-
tion of a channel width (i.e., < 3 km s−1) over the whole
FoV. The signal measured along the scanning sequence was
separated into two parts: (i) an almost constant level pro-
duced by the continuum light in a 15˚A passband around Hα
(continuum map, not presented in this work); (ii) a varying
part produced by the Hα line (Hα integrated ﬂux map). The
continuum is computed by taking the mean signal outside
the emission line. The Hα integrated ﬂux map was obtained
by integrating the monochromatic proﬁle in each pixel. The
velocity sampling was 11.6 km s−1. Strong OH night-sky
lines passing through the ﬁlters were subtracted by deter-
mining the level of emission away from our target (Laval et
al. 1987).

The velocity dispersion (σ hereafter) is derived from the
determination of the FWHM from the determined proﬁle.
Then the real dispersion velocity is found supposing that
diﬀerent contributions follow a gaussian function.

PSF model is a Gaussian of given FWHM and the convo-
lution is computed using FFT on oversampled vectors. We
use the nominal value of the FWHM of the PSF of the UVOT
ﬁlters. The residuals, µ − µSersic, are shown in two panels
of Figures 3, together with the values of the S´ersic indices
for each of the UVOT bands reported in the top right cor-
ner of the two panels. The S´ersic indices are in the range
1.09±0.13≤ n ≤1.79±0.06

We remind that the S´ersic law has three special cases
when n=1, the value for an exponential proﬁle, and n = 0.5,
for a Gaussian luminosity proﬁle and n=4 for a bulge. The
range of our S´ersic indices suggests that NGC 454 E has a
disk. Residuals in Figure 3 shows a trend starting at about
a1/4 (cid:39) 1.6(cid:48)(cid:48) consistently with a clear change in color in the
(U V M 2 − V ) color proﬁle.

4 IONIZED GAS MOMENT MAPS

We extract from SAM+FP observations the monochromatic
Hα emission map, the radial velocity and velocity dispersion
maps. In Figure 4 we show HST F450W image (Stiavelli et
al. 1998) (top left panel) on the same scale with our Hα
monochromatic map (bottom left panel), heliocentric radial
velocity map (top right panel), and velocity dispersion map
(bottom right panel) of the system, corrected from broaden-
ing.

SWIFT-UVOT OBSERVATIONS

The color composite images in optical and NUV bands from
the Swift-UVOT observations are shown in the top panels of
Figure 2. Images show that the NGC 454 W emission dom-
inates in the NUV bands. In NUV NGC 454 W1- W6 com-
plexes appear included in a unique envelope which elongates
up to NGC 454 SW and SE. In NUV two complexes, already
revealed in Hα by Johansson (1988), are projected between
NGC 454 SE and NGC 454 W. NGC 454 S, shown in Fig-
ure 1, appears connected to NGC 454 SW.

We derived the luminosity proﬁles and (U V M 2 − V )
and (B − V ) color proﬁles of NGC 454 E. They are shown
in the middle and bottom panels of Figure 2. Luminosity
proﬁles have been derived using the task ELLIPSE in the
package IRAF (Jedrzejewski 1987). These are not corrected
for galactic extinction. Since we aim at parameterizing the
galaxy structure we have truncated the proﬁle at ≈35(cid:48)(cid:48) (a1/4
= 2.43) where the distortion by NGC 454 W, in particular
in NUV, becomes dominant.

The (B−V ) color proﬁle tends to become bluer with the
galacto-centric distance as shown in Stiavelli et al. (1998).
The trend is much clear along the (U V M 2−V ) color proﬁle.
Stiavelli et al. (1998) parametrized the HST luminosty
proﬁles with a composite bulge plus disk model. Due to our
poorer resolution and PSF, to parametrize the trend of op-
tical and NUV surface brightness proﬁles we adopt a S´ersic
r1/n law (Sersic 1968), widely used for early-type galaxies
as a generalization of the r1/4 de Vaucouleurs (1948) law
(see e.g. Rampazzo et al. 2017, and references therein). We
best ﬁt a S´ersic law convolved with a PSF, using a custom
IDL routine based on the MPFit package (Markwardt et al.
2009), accounting for errors in the surface photometry. The

Both narrow band imaging (Johansson 1988) and spec-
troscopy (Donzelli & Pastoriza 2000; Tanvuia et al. 2003)
revealed Hα emission in the NGC 454 system. The bottom
left panel of Figure 4 shows the Hα monochromatic inten-
sity (I) map detected by our FP observations. Hα emis-
sion is revealed in the nucleus of NGC 454 E, in the NGC
454 W region and in the NGC 454 SE and SW complexes.
NGC 454 W region shows a structured Hα emission. In this
region we spot 6 complexes we labeled from W1 to W6,
roughly from North to South, as shown in Figure 4 (bottom
left panel).

NGC454 E has a Seyfert 2-type nucleus with broad, 250
and 300 km s−1, emission line proﬁles (Johansson 1988).
That ﬁts into the Free Spectral Range of our etalon (almost
500 km s−1). We apply a 5×5 px (0.212×0.212 kpc) boxcar
smoothing to enhance the signal in the nuclear zone. The
emission extends 3.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 × 2.(cid:48)(cid:48)0 (0.8 kpc × 0.7 kpc) around the
center of NGC 454 E. Integrating the signal within boxes
(see Figure 5) along the line connecting the NGC 454 E
nucleus to the brightest complex of NGC 454 W (we labeled
W1) we reveal emission lines whose proﬁles have complex
shapes.

The W1 complex is the brightest in NGC 454 W, show-
ing a nearly circular shape and a diameter of 5.(cid:48)(cid:48)7 (1.3 kpc);
the W6 complex is the larger, extending to 8.(cid:48)(cid:48)5 (2 kpc).
In the NUV map we may distinguish all the W1–W6 com-
plexes but they appear more extended and interconnected
than shown by our FP observations.

The NGC 454 SW and NGC 454 SE emission complexes
shown in Figure 4 are relatively weaker than the W1–W6
complexes. We need to integrate the signal within 5×5 pix-
els bins to detect a connection between these complexes as

4.2 Radial velocity map

Figure 4 (top right panel) shows the 2D radial velocity, Vr,
map of NGC 454. NGC 454 E velocity ﬁeld is diﬃcult to
interpret because this object is an AGN showing large line
proﬁles, almost covering our free spectral range. Neverthe-
less, a velocity gradient of 130 km s−1, across 4(cid:48)(cid:48)(0.94 kpc),
is measured.

Velocities in the NGC 454 W range over 70 km s−1, from
maximum of 3645 km s−1 measured in the W2 complex to a
minimum of 3575 km s−1 in the southern tip of W6 complex.
None of the W1–W6 complexes has a rotation pattern. The
W6 complex shows a velocity gradient of 35 km s−1 across a
length of 8.(cid:48)(cid:48)3 (1.95 kpc). The NGC 454 SW and NGC 454 SE
complexes do not present velocity gradients. With respect
to the W1-W6 complexes the SW and SE complexes are
receding with a systemic velocity of 3725 km s−1 and 3691
km s−1, respectively, with a velocity diﬀerence ∆V (cid:39)115-
145 km s−1 with respect to W1 complex.

4.3 Velocity dispersion map

The velocity dispersion, σ, map is shown in the bottom right
panel of Figure 4. As mentioned before, NGC 454 E shows
very broad proﬁles, very close to our free spectral range. In
those conditions, we prefer not to show a velocity dispersion
map for this galaxy. We measure σ values ranging from 14 to
42 km s−1 in the W3, W4, W5, W6 complexes. σ values of
NGC 454 SW and NGC 454 SE are homogeneous, between
20 and 29 km s−1 . We point out that values exceeding 10
- 20 km s−1 indicate supersonic motions (see e.g. Smith &
Weedman 1970). The W1 complex shows the highest values,
up to 66 km s−1, while in the W2 complex, σ ranges from
13 to 32 km s−1.

4.4 Emission between H II regions

Figure 5 and Figures 6 show several regions in be-
tween NGC 454 E and NGC 454 W1 (Figure 5),
NGC 454 SW and NGC 454 SE (Figure 6 top) and between
NGC 454 W3 W4 W5 and W6 (Figure 6 bottom).

Figure 5, regions 1 and 2 show the emission centered in
the elliptical. As mentioned before, the center of NGC 454 E
has a broad emission as shown in region 2. With an emission
peak above 3800 (in relative units) and a background of
2500, region 2 has a very high intensity considering that

shown in the Johansson’s Hα narrow band image. The bot-
tom panels of Figure 6 show emission lines proﬁles in several
areas of NGC 454 W, NGC 454 SE and NGC 454 SW.

Both the Hα image by Johansson (1988) and in our
NUV images show an elongated emission region between
NGC 454 SW and NGC 454 W1 complex, weaker than the
other regions. We also detect emission in between the SW,
SE complex and the SW1 region (see Figure 4). Our observa-
tion is showing a much smaller extension (1.(cid:48)(cid:48)1 corresponding
to 0.3 kpc) compared to Johansson (1988).

To summarize, the W1–W6 as well as SW and SE in
NGC 454 W are huge (up to 2 kpc wide) complexes of ion-
ized interstellar medium (ISM hereafter). Ionized ISM is also
found in NGC 454 E center and along the line connecting it
to NGC 454 W1 complex.

background is dominated by poisson noise and even if
we consider that the proﬁle has a FWHM of 300km s−1
(compared to the 500 km s−1 of the free spectral range), we
still see the emission of the center of the elliptical. Regions 3

shows the limit of our detection with an emission peak at
one σ above the continuum level. Regions 5 and 6 show

emission proﬁles between
the SE and SW regions. Emission is very clear across
both regions. No substantial velocity gradient is visible
even if the radial velocity of SW is 30 km s−1 lower than SE.

Figure 6 (bottom) shows the connection between the

remaining regions (NGC 454 W3 to W6). Emission is strong
and it is clear that all regions are connected. Zones 1 and 12
show asymmetric proﬁles, probably due to a second compo-
nent. A radial velocity gradient is visible between the south-
ern tip with zone 5 and region 1.

5 H II REGIONS DIAGNOSTIC DIAGRAMS

5.1 Description of the complexes

Complexes in NGC 454 W, share similar dynamical char-
acteristics both with Giant H ii Regions and the so-called
H ii Galaxies. Firstly, like GH iiRs, W1 has high supersonic
proﬁles (Smith & Weedman 1970) and, secondly, the
high velocity dispersion surrenders high monochromatic
emission. Several studies using Fabry-Perot interferometer
(Mu˜noz-Tu˜n´on et al. 1996) found this signature in nearby

Giant H ii Region, like NGC 604. More recently, still using
Fabry-Perot and IFU spectroscopy Bordalo et al. (2009);
Moiseev & Lozinskaya (2012); Plana & Carvalho (2017),
evidences have been found of such signature within dwarf
H ii galaxies.

Figure 7 considers three diﬀerent diagnostic diagrams
used to study the kinematics of H ii regions These diagnostic
diagrams are shown for NGC 454 W complexes (W1-W6
identiﬁed in Figure 4) and for NGC 454 SW and SE regions.
The W1 complex has the larger intensity range. We
will discuss the (I − σ) regimes in this region in Section 5.2
with a statistical approach.

The panels (a) in Figure 7 represent the intensity vs
the dispersion velocity (sigma). The W2 – W6 as well as
SW1, SW2 and SE complexes show similar intensity and
sigma ranges. In W3 – W6 as well as NGC 454 SW and
SE complexes the scatter of σ increases as the intensity de-
creases. As discussed by Moiseev & Lozinskaya (2012) (their
Figure 6) this shape is produced within star forming com-
plexes with signiﬁcant excursion of gas densities, indicating
low density, turbulent ISM. At high density (high intensity)
regime H ii regions have either nearly constant or low scat-
ter σ. However, towards lower density (low intensity) the
high perturbed/turbulent gas surrounding H ii regions may
emerge so decreasing the intensity the σ scatter may in-
crease. We have separated the diﬀerent regions: W3, W4,
W5 and W6 as SE, SW1 and SW2 complexes in these dia-
grams. The last row of Figure 7 shows the SE, SW1 and SW2
complexes I vs σ diagram, but none of the three complexes
shows a diﬀerent pattern. Introduced by Mu˜noz-Tu˜n´on et al.
(1996), the (I−σ) diagram has been used by those authors to
identify expanding shells by localising inclined bands. This
interpretation is based on the fact that the velocity disper-
sion should be higher at the center of the shell and the in-
tensity lower because less material is crossed along the line
of sight than at the shell inner and outer edges. Assuming

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

this pattern, the inclination of the band can also be inter-
preted in term of age of the shell itself. As the shell ages,
the velocity dispersion at the center decreases as well as
the intensity diﬀerence between the center and inner edge
of the shell (see ﬁgure 3 in Mu˜noz-Tu˜n´on et al. 1996). The
Moiseev & Lozinskaya (2012) interpretation tends to act for
larger scales, where high velocity dispersion is not related
to speciﬁc expanding shells, but rather belong to the diﬀuse
low brightness emission.

The panels (b) in Figure 7 represent the intensity vs.
radial velocity, (I − Vr), diagram of W1-W6 complexes in
NGC 454 W, and in the SW1, SW2 and SE.

The range of radial velocity, Vr, within complexes is
small, of the order of 20-40 km s−1 in the W3 – W6 and
NGC 454 SW1, SW2 and SE complexes. Large radial ve-
locity excursion at all intensities is found in W2. The W3,
W4, W5 and W6 complexes show diﬀerent radial velocities,
with W4 having the highest and W6 the lowest. W6 velocity
range is larger because of the velocity gradient we already
mentioned in Section 4. The separation in radial velocity be-
tween the SE, SW1 and SW2 complexes is shown in the plot
(b) of the last row of Figure 7. The complex NGC 454 SE,
SW and SW2 have a small variation, 10-20 km s−1, of Vr
while the monochromatic intensity range is similar to W3
– W6 complexes. It also appears that SW1 complex has a
closer radial velocity with SE than with SW2. According to
(Bordalo et al. 2009) (their ﬁgure 13b), a vertical band in
this diagram, representing a velocity variation in a short in-
tensity range, means a radial motion such as an expansion,
but it could also means an inﬂow. The physical mechanisms
in action are several including turbulence, winds, ﬂows, bub-
bles or the self gravity of the complexes at diﬀerent scales.
Even if a vertical band can appear in the plot representing
W2 (second row), it is diﬃcult to interpret it as a signature
of a radial motion, the intensity range being too wide.

in the same regions. Bordalo et al. (2009) pointed out that a
dependence between the variables may indicate systematic
relative motion of the clouds in the complex. They presented
an idealized pattern for this diagram. Inclined (Vr − σ) pat-
terns would represent systematic motion like Champagne
ﬂows, such that cloud of gas with high σ moves away from
us (positive slope) or toward us (negative slope).

We perform a standard Pearson’s product-moment cor-
relation test for the diﬀerent complexes of NGC 454, in or-
der to show the existence of systematic motions mentioned
above. Except for W1 and SW1, all regions show weak-
moderate correlation, according this test. W2 has a corre-
lation coeﬃcient of -0.34, W3 of -0.43, W4 of -0.23, W5 of
-0.27, W6 of -0.17. The SE and SW2 regions also have a

weak-moderate correlation with a coeﬃcient of 0.48 and -
0.25. All of them with a 99.9% conﬁdence level. The case of
SW1 is a bit more complex. The Pearson test is not conclu-
sive and we decide to use a robust correlation test in order to
put lower weight in marginal points. Using the WRS2 package
in R, we found a correlation of -0.2 with a 90% conﬁdence
level.

We perform a simple linear regression (the solid line
in Figure 7 panels (c)) for the regions where the Pearson
test shows a weak-moderate correlation: W2 to W6, SE and
SW2. In this context W2 and SW2 regions can be inter-
preted as complexes with relatively high dispersion, moving
toward the observer (negative slope). In the case of the SE

complex, the slope is positive and it can be interpreted as a
complex moving away from the observer.

Previous studies, on Giant H ii Region or emitting dwarf
galaxies, also used those diagnostic diagrams when these ob-
jects are smaller and the scale resolution much smaller than
here. For example NGC 604 study from Mu˜noz-Tu˜n´on et al.
(1996) or dwarf galaxies from Moiseev & Lozinskaya (2012)
or Bordalo et al. (2009) have respectively scale resolution of
3.31pc/(cid:48)(cid:48)and 21pc/(cid:48)(cid:48). This is ten times smaller than our ob-
ject. Even though, we found remarkable similarities between
diagnostics diagrams.

5.2 Statistical analysis of the (I − σ) diagrams for

W1 complex

We use the R statistical package (R Development Core Team
2009) to analyze the (I −σ) diagram of the W1 complex. R is
largely use in diﬀerent statistical analysis. The Mclust rou-
tine only has been recently used in astrophysics by (Einasto
et al. 2010) to detect structure in galaxies clusters. We aim
at ﬁnding how many independent components are present
(task Mclust), to locate them in the diagram and in the
σ map (so-called geographic location). Mclust is a R func-
tion for model-based clustering, classiﬁcation, and density
estimation based on ﬁnite Gaussian mixture modeling. An
integrated approach to ﬁnite mixture models is provided,
with routines that combine model-based hierarchical clus-
tering and several tools for model selection (see Fraley &
Raferty 2007).

k πk = 1), (µk, Σk) are the mean
the covariance matrix of the component k, and d is the di-
mension of the data. A central question in ﬁnite mixture
modeling is how many components should be included in
the mixture. In the multivariate setting, the volume, shape,
and orientation of the covariances deﬁne diﬀerent models
(or parametrization) with their diﬀerent geometric charac-
teristics. In Mclust, the number of mixing components and
the best covariance parameterization are selected using the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The task outputs µk,
Σk and πk for k running from 1 to m. Mclust also relates
each element in the dataset to a particular component in the
mixture. To gain some ﬂexibility on this classiﬁcation, we
combine the central result of Mclust, the number of com-
ponents m, with the result of another R task: the mvnor-
malmixEM function.

This task belongs to the mixtools package, which
provides a set of functions for analyzing a variety of ﬁnite
mixture models. The general methodology used in mixtools
involves the representation of the mixture problem as a

particular case of maximum likelihood estimation when
the observations can be viewed as incomplete data. The
code uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
that maximizes the conditional expected log-likelihood at
each M-step of the algorithm – see details in Benaglia et
al. (2009). The code returns the posterior probabilities for
each observation with respect to the m diﬀerent components.

Since running Mclust results m = 2 components, we
then use the task mvnormalmixEM, looking at two indepen-
dent classes with 80% conﬁdence in the (I − σ) maps. Once
these two classes have been found, we have represented them
in the (I − σ) diagram (Figure 8 upper panel) and in the σ
map (Figure 8 lower panel). The ﬁgure clearly shows the
two regions, one in the center (low dispersion and strong
emission) and the other surrounding it (high dispersion and
low emission). W1 is an extended ionized ISM complex so we
cannot easily apply the interpretative scheme of H ii regions.
We may exclude that W1 may be interpreted as an expand-
ing wind-blown bubble would have a diﬀerent signature in
a (I − σ) map: σ values should decrease from the center to
the edge of the shell, according Lagrois & Joncas (2009).
The two regimes evidenced by the statistical approach sup-
port the picture proposed by Moiseev & Lozinskaya (2012)
in which the W1 complex can be viewed as composed of
a giant dense HII region in the central part and turbulent
low-density gas cloud in its outskirt.

6 Hα LINE PROFILE DECOMPOSITION

Figure 4 (bottom right panel) shows the large range of σ
in the W1 complex with respect to the other complexes in
NGC 454 W as well as in the NGC 454 SW and SE. Figure 5
shows that emission lines are quite broad so that the high
velocity dispersion in the W1 complex can be attributed to
the presence of multiple components in the emission proﬁles.
Figure 9 shows line proﬁles resulting from the mapping of
the W1 and W2 complexes.

We perform a gaussian decomposition of the 14 Hα line

proﬁles (13 in W1 and one in W2 as a sort of control ﬁeld)
shown in Figure 9. Each region represents a 3×3 pixels box
(0.54(cid:48)(cid:48)×0.54(cid:48)(cid:48) area, 0.13×0.13 kpc). The decomposition has
been performed using a home made program with three dif-
ferent Gaussian components. We ﬁrst ﬁt the brightest com-
ponent, subtracts it and then ﬁt the two others, until the ﬁ-
nal ﬁt converges. Figure 9 shows the decomposition of these
proﬁles and the location of areas in W1 and W2. Table 4
lists the characteristics of the three Gaussian components
ordered by decreasing intensity component.

We are aware that a simple mathematical approach is
always unsatisfactory, since the composition is not unique,
but linked to a physical and kinematical interpretation, we
are reasonably satisﬁed with the result.

Considering the results of the decomposition reported
in Table 4, shown in Figure 9 we draw the following conclu-
sions:

The central region, labeled W1 7, has a symmetrical
proﬁle when compared to all the others regions. The σ of
the brightest Gaussian component of W1 complex has su-
personic values between 20 and 25 km s−1. The σ of the
main component of all regions in W1 is larger than in W2.
With respect to the systemic velocity the main Gaussian
component in W1 [1 to 5] is red-shifted while in the zones
W1 [9 to 11] is blue-shifted, sketching a sort of rotation pat-
tern being at the opposite sides of the W1 complex center.
We also can note that positions of the second component
with respect to the main one (second red-shifted component
at one side of the W1 complex, and the second blue-shifted
component at the other side) could be seen as a bipolar out-
ﬂow due to massive star formation.

Several zones of W1 clearly show proﬁles with an ap-
parent second component (e.g. W1 1, W1 2, W1 3, W1 4
and W1 6), while, in general, the other zones, including the
W2 zone, need fainter components to ﬁt the wings of the
line proﬁles.

We conclude that even with multiple Gaussian ﬁt anal-
ysis no un-ambiguous rotation pattern emerges in the W1

7 DISCUSSION

7.1 NGC 454: General view

In the NGC 454 system, there is no evidence of a velocity
diﬀerence between the two members. The pair is furthermore
strongly isolated as discussed in Appendix A. Our observa-
tions do not provide direct evidence of gas re-fueling of NGC
454 E on the part of NGC 454 W. We found, however, traces
of ionized gas beyond the nucleus as shown in Figure 5. We
detect broad emission line in the NGC 454 E nucleus but
the small Free Spectral range prevents us to disentangle the
presence of multiple components which may provide us in-
formation about possible gas infall (see e.g. Rampazzo et
al. 2006; Font et al. 2011; Zaragoza-Cardiel et al. 2013, and
references therein). However velocity gradient of about 130
km s−1 have been revealed in the central 4(cid:48)(cid:48). Swift-UVOT ob-
servations of NGC 454 E suggest that the galaxy is an S0
since a disk emerge in all the UVOT bands when a S´ersic
law is ﬁtted to the luminosity proﬁle. Both the (B − V )
and (M 2 − V ) color proﬁles become bluer with the galacto-
centric distance supporting the presence of a disk (see also
Rampazzo et al. 2017). The disk is itself strongly perturbed
by the interaction as can deduced by the distortion in the
NGC 454 T area (Figure 1).

Both Johansson (1988) and Stiavelli et al. (1998) specu-
lated whether the morphology of NGC 454 W pair member
was a spiral or an irregular galaxy, before the interaction.
The galaxy, strongly star forming, dominates in the NUV
images with respect to NGC 454 E. There is one evidence
coming out from our velocity map: no rotation pattern are
revealed, even in NGC 454 W1 complex. The velocity diﬀer-
ence between the complexes reaches ≈140 km s−1 (Figure 4)
if we include the NGC 454 SE an SW complexes, and it is
about 60 km s−1 considering only NGC 454 W1-W6. To
summarize, if NGC 454 W was a former spiral galaxy it ap-
pears completely distorted by the encounter and this latter
is not at an early phase. In the next section, we will investi-
gate the formation and evolution of this pair highligthening
a possible interaction which matches the global properties
of this pair, i.e. its total magnitude, morphology and multi-
wavelength SED.

NGC 454 SW, SE have a projected separation of ≈37.(cid:48)(cid:48)19
(8.7 kpc) and ≈39.(cid:48)(cid:48)86 (9.4 kpc) from the center of W1, i.e.
they occupy a very peripheral position with respect to the
bulk of the galaxy. Figure 1 and Figure 2 both show that
there is a very faint connection with the rest of the galaxy.
Our kinematical study suggests that the two complexes do
not show a rotation pattern. So NGC 454 SW and SE dif-
fer from tidal dwarf candidates as described in Lelli et al.
(2015). Figure 6 shows that Hα emission lines, detected also
in between the SW and SE stellar complexes, are not com-
posed of multiple components. According to the scheme pro-
posed by Moiseev & Lozinskaya (2012) the (I − σ) plots
(Figure 7) suggests that the ionized gas in SW and SE stel-
lar complexes have the characteristic of dense H ii regions
surrounded by low-density gas with considerable turbulent
motions (see the scheme in their Figure 6) not dissimilar
from W2-W6 complexes.

To summarize both the Swift-UVOT NUV observations
and the diﬀuse Hα emission indicate that NGC 454 W,
NGC 454 SW and SE complexes are strongly star forming
regions. The anatomy of these complexes made using (I −σ),

Using the characteristics of the Gaussian decomposition

diagnostic diagram, showing the (I − σ) diagram for the
main i.e. the brightest component. In Figure 10, top panel,
we present the mean σ per intensity bin. The associated er-
ror bar represents the standard deviation in the bin. The
red points represent the intensity and σ of the main com-
ponent (see component 1 in Table 4). As mentioned before,
σ is signiﬁcantly lower, still largely supersonic and similar,
on the average, to regions W2–W6, and SE-SW shown in
the bottom panel of Figure 10. However, the σ of the main
component in W1 shows a positive slope with I.

(I − Vr) and (Vr − σ) diagnostic diagrams indicates that H ii
shells of diﬀerent ages are present as well as zones of gas
turbulence as expected by the interplay of star formation
and SNae explosion in the IGM. Although our observations
did not reveal direct evidence of gas infall on the center of
NGC 454 E there is signatures of recent star formation, in
addition to the non thermal Seyfert 2 emission. Mendoza-
Castrej´on et al. (2015) reported the presence in Spitzer-IRS
spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which
are connected to recent star formation episodes (see eg. Vega
2010; Rampazzo et al. 2013, and references therein).

7.2 Possible evolutionary scenario

We investigate the evolution of the NGC 454 system us-
ing smooth particle hydrodynamical (SPH) simulation with
chemo-photometric implementation (Mazzei et al. 2014,
and references therein). Simulations have been carried out
with diﬀerent total mass (for each system from 1013 M(cid:12) to
1010 M(cid:12)), mass ratios (1:1 - 10:1), gas fraction (0.1 - 0.01)
and particle number (initial total number from 40000 to
220000). All our simulations of galaxy formation and evolu-
tion start from collapsing triaxial systems (with triaxiality
ratio, τ =0.84 (Mazzei et al. 2014), composed of dark matter
(DM) and gas and include self-gravity of gas, stars and DM,
radiative cooling, hydrodynamical pressure, shock heating,
viscosity, star formation, feedback from evolving stars and
type II supernovae, and chemical enrichment as in Mazzei &
Curir (2003). We carried out diﬀerent simulations varying
the orbital initial conditions in order to have, for the ideal
Keplerian orbit of two points of given masses, the ﬁrst peri-

centre separation, p, equal to the initial length of the major
axis of the more massive triaxial halo down to 1/10 of the
same axis. For each peri-centre separation we changed the
eccentricity in order to have hyperbolic orbits of diﬀerent
energy. The spins of the systems are generally parallel each
other and perpendicular to the orbital plane, so we studied
direct encounters. Some cases with misaligned spins have

been also analysed in order to investigate the eﬀects of the
system initial rotation on the results. From our grid of sim-
ulations we single out the one which simultaneously (i.e., at
the same snapshot) accounts for the following observational
constrains providing the best-ﬁt of the global properties of
NGC 454: i) total absolute B-band magnitude within the
range allowed by observations (see below); ii) the predicted
spectral energy distribution (SED hereafter) in agreement
with the observed one; iii) morphology like the observed one
in the same bands and with the same spatial scale (arc-
sec/kpc). The results we present are predictions of the sim-
ulation which best reproduces all the previous observational
constrains at the same snapshot. This snapshot sets the age
of the galaxy.

To obtain the SED of the whole system extended over
the widest wavelength range, we add to our UV and optical
Swift-UVOT total ﬂuxes (green points in Figure 11) the B, R
and IRAS data (red points in Figure 11) in NED, and the
J, H, K total ﬂuxes, derived from 2MASS archive images,
which perfectly agree with J, H and K values reported by
Tully (2015). All these data are corrected for galactic extinc-
tion as reported in §2.2 (Table 3) and §6. The black point
in Figure 11 is AKARI/FIS detection. The solid line (red) in
Figure 11 highlights the predicted SED.

The simulation which provides this ﬁt corresponds to a
major merger between two halos, initially of dark matter and
gas, of equal mass and gas fraction (0.1), with perpendicular
spins and total mass 4×1012 M(cid:12). Their mass centres are ini-
tially 1.4 Mpc away each other and move at relative velocity
of 120 kms −1. Table 5 reports the input parameters of the
SPH-CPI simulation best ﬁtting the global properties of the
system. The age of the system is 12.4 Gyrs at the best-ﬁt.
The far-IR SED accounts for a B-band attenuation of 0.85
mag so that the absolute B-band magnitude of the best-ﬁt
snapshot is -21.0 mag. This is the value to be compared
with that derived from the distance in Table 1 accounting
for an error of ±3.5 Mpc and a total B-band magnitude of
12.66±0.21 mag (from Table 3) , that is MB=-20.64±0.41
mag.

Our ﬁt of the far-IR emission implies a warm dust com-
ponent, heated by the UV radiation of H ii regions, and a
cold component heated by the general radiation ﬁeld, both
including PAH molecules as described in Mazzei et al. (1992,
1994), and Mazzei & Zotti (1994), with a relative contribu-
tion, rw/c=0.5 which means that 50% of the far-IR emission
is due to warm dust emission. The cutoﬀ radius of the cold
dust distribution in Figure 11 is 100 rc, rc being the core
radius (Mazzei et al. 1994).

The shape of the far-IR SED suggests the presence of
a large amount of dust: the ratio between the the far-IR

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2017)

luminosity and the observed luminosity in the UV to near-
IR spectral range is 2.5.

Figure 12 shows the morphology of our simulation at
the best-ﬁt age to be compared with that in Figure 2. We
point out that the West component dominates the UV mor-
phology and the Est component the optical one, as observed.
The simulation shows that these systems will merge within
0.2 Gyr.

Therefore, our approach points towards a picture where
E+S pairs can be understood in terms of 1:1 encounters
giving rise to a merger in less than 1 Gyr. Of course, this
framework deserves further investigation, that is beyond the
scope of this work.

8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We used SAM-FP observations at SOAR and Swift-UVOT
archival images to investigate the kinematical and photo-
metric properties of the NGC 454 interacting/merging sys-
tem.

According to the deﬁnition in Stiavelli et al. (1998),
we subdivided the system in NGC 454 E, the early-
type member, NGC 454 T, the perturbed area to the
North of NGC 454 W, the late-type member, and the two
NGC 454 SW and SE complexes South of the late-type. Fur-
ther subdivision of the NGC 454 W member into W1-W6
have been used to detail single Hα complexes revealed by
the monochromatic map (see also Johansson 1988).

We found the following results:
The Hα map shows that the emission is mostly detected
in the NGC 454 W system and in the NGC 454SW and
NGC 454 SE complexes. A Hα broad emission is revealed
in the center of NGC 454 E, with a velocity gradient of 130
km s−1 across 4(cid:48)(cid:48).

The radial velocity map does not have a rotation pat-
tern neither in the W1-W6 complexes in NGC 454 W, nor in
the two SW and SE complexes. W6 shows a velocity gradient
of 45 km s−1.

The velocity dispersion map shows that most of the W3-
W6, SW and SE complexes have a velocity dispersion in
the range 20-25 km s−1. The highest velocity dispersion, 68
km s−1 and the lowest, 15 km s−1, are measured in the W1
and W2 complexes, respectively.

We use (I − σ) (I − V ) (σ − V ) (see eg. Bordalo et
al. 2009) diagnostic diagrams to study the kinematics of the
W1-W6 complexes in NGC 454 W and the SW and SE com-
plexes. Diagnostic diagrams show that all regions, except W1
and SW1, have a weak-moderate correlation between the
radial velocity and the dispersion interpreted as systematic
motions toward or away from the observer. These diagrams

conﬁrm that W1 has high supersonic velocity dispersion and
a closer analysis could separate two populations, one in the
center with a low dispersion and a second, around it with
a higher σ. According to Moiseev & Lozinskaya (2012), W1
could show a Giant HII Region in the center and a turbulent
low-density gas cloud in its outskirt. This picture can be dis-
cussed further if we take into account the several large pro-
ﬁles in W1 show multiple components. If we only take into
account the main component (the brightest), the situation
is reversed, with a broader line in the center and narrowed
ones around. This can be interpreted as a expanding wind
blow bubble according to Lagrois & Joncas (2009).

Based on our SPH simulation with chemo-photometric
implementation, the global properties of the system, 12.4
Gyr old, are compatible with an encounter between two ha-
los of equal mass and perpendicular spin. They will merge
within 0.2 Gyr. The SED suggests a large FIR emission 2.5
times that in the NUV-NIR range.

The case of NGC 454 system suggests that a class of
mixed pairs form via the encounter/merging of similar mass,
evolving halos. The diﬀerent morphologies, emphasized by
multi-λ observations, mark a late phase of the merging pro-
cess.

The NGC 454 system: anatomy of a mixed on-going merger

19

APPENDIX A: THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE
NGC 454 SYSTEM

The NGC 454 system is an isolated pair, RR 23, in the
Reduzzi & Rampazzo (1995) catalogue. Assuming the dis-
tance given in Table 1 we used Hyperleda to inspect a box
of 4×4 Mpc2 for possible neighbors of this nearby system.
Table A1, which includes the pair members, provides the
galaxy identiﬁcation (col. 1 and col. 2), the right ascension
and declination (col.s 3 and 4), the morphological Type (col.
5), the heliocentric velocity (col. 6), the major axis diameter
d25 (col. 7) and the axial ratio r25 (col. 8) at µB=25 mag
arcsec2, the position angle (col. 9) and the total B-band ap-
parent magnitude (col. 10).

Most the galaxies in Table A1 are listed in A Cata-
logue of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations (Arp
& Madore 1987) where they are recognized either to show
peculiar fearures (AM 0058-580 compact galaxy with dia-
metric jets; AM 0102-573 disrupted galaxy + 2 companions;
AM 0126-525 ring or galaxy with loop; AM 0126-515 dis-
turbed spiral) or to be pair members (like our NGC 454
system i.e. AM112-554 I/A double + resolved knots)

Figure A1 shows the histogram of the recession velocity
distribution (1000 – 6000 km s−1) in an area of 4×4 Mpc2
around NGC 454 and the spatial distribution in the same
area of the nearby galaxies, shown in green in the top panel.
The nearby neighbors are disk galaxies either S0s or Spirals
according to the classiﬁcation of Hyperleda. The velocity
dispersion of these galaxies is 65 km s−1. This value has to
be compared with 327+12
−2 km s−1 of NGC 5486, the third
rich galaxy association in the nearby Universe (Marino et
al. 2016) and with 92 +3
−2 km s−11 of LGG 225 a very loose
group discussed in Mazzei et al. (2014). This picture con-
ﬁrms that NGC 454 system is isolated and located in a very
poor environment (see also Tully 2015).

This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX ﬁle prepared by
the author.
