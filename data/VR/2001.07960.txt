ABSTRACT

Fixation prediction (FP) in panoramic contents has been
widely investigated along with the booming trend of virtual
reality (VR) applications. However, another issue within the
ﬁeld of visual saliency, salient object detection (SOD), has
been seldom explored in 360◦ (or omnidirectional) images
due to the lack of datasets representative of real scenes with
pixel-level annotations. Toward this end, we collect 107
equirectangular panoramas with challenging scenes and mul-
tiple object classes. Based on the consistency between FP and
explicit saliency judgements, we further manually annotate
1,165 salient objects over the collected images with precise
masks under the guidance of real human eye ﬁxation maps.
Six state-of-the-art SOD models are then benchmarked on the
proposed ﬁxation-based 360◦ image dataset (F-360iSOD),
by applying a multiple cubic projection-based ﬁne-tuning
method. Experimental results show a limitation of the current
methods when used for SOD in panoramic images, which
indicates the proposed dataset is challenging. Key issues for
360◦ SOD is also discussed. The proposed dataset is available
at https://github.com/PanoAsh/F-360iSOD.

1. INTRODUCTION

The panoramic image, or 360◦ (omnidirectional) image,
which captures the content on the whole 360×180◦ viewing
range surrounding a viewer, plays an import role in virtual
reality (VR) applications and distinguishes itself from tradi-
tional 2-dimensional (2D) image which covers only one spe-
ciﬁc plane. Recently, commercial Head-Mounted Displays
(HMDs) are developed to provide observers an immersive
even interactive experience by allowing them to freely rotate
their head and thus focusing on desired scenes and objects.
Considering the fact that some salient parts of the 360◦ im-
age attract more human attentions than others [1], visual
saliency prediction in panoramas becomes one of the focused
issues within the ﬁeld of computer vision and is considered
as a key to study human observation behavior in virtual en-
vironments. The ﬁxation prediction (FP) and salient object
detection (SOD) are both closely related to the concept of
visual saliency. Thanks to the accessibility of HMDs and eye

trackers, image [2] and video (e.g., [3–5]) datasets have been
constructed for the deep learning-based FP in panoramic con-
tent. However, to the best of our knowledge, [6] is the only
study for SOD in 360◦ scenarios, which does not use the ﬁx-
ations as a guidance for the salient object annotation.

As shown in Fig. 1, 360◦ images tend to have richer
scenes and much more foreground objects compared to
ﬂat-2D images from traditional SOD datasets (e.g., [7–12]).
Therefore, it is more challenging to differentiate the salient
objects from the non-salient ones in panoramas. Preserving
360◦ images with a few obvious foreground objects while
discarding those ambiguous ones may bring selection bias to
the dataset, thus being inefﬁcient for exploring the real hu-
man attention behavior as viewing panoramic content. Based
on the strong correlation between FP and explicit human
judgements [13], and the successfully established ﬁxation-
based 2D SOD datasets [13–15], we argue that the salient
objects in panoramas can also be manually annotated with
the assistance of ﬁxations, thus representing the real-world
daily scenes. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a
ﬁxation-based 360◦ image dataset (F-360iSOD) with both the
object-/instance-level pixel-wise annotations is proposed; 2)
six newly proposed state-of-the-art 2D SOD models [16–21]
are benchmarked by ﬁve widely used SOD metrics [22–26]
on the proposed dataset in a cross-testing manner, with a
multiple cubic projection-based ﬁne-tuning strategy [27]; 3)
key issues for 360◦ SOD are discussed.

 
 
 
 
 
 
2. RELATED WORK

2.1. 2D SOD Datasets

ECSSD [7], SOD [8], PASCAL-S [9], HKU-IS [10], DUTS
[11] and DUT-OMRON [12] are the six most widely used
image datasets to benchmark the deep learning-based 2D
SOD models, these datasets all provide improved pixel-wise
object-level annotations and high challenges.
It is worth
mentioning that many deep learning-based SOD models are
trained on the training set of the DUTS since 2017. The
DUTS is so far the largest image dataset for SOD which
contains 10,553 images for training and a testing set of 5,019
images. SOC [28] is a more recently proposed SOD dataset
with 6,000 images and about 80 category labels. The dataset
includes 3,000 images without salient objects (or with only
the presence of background objects) and both the precise
object-/instance-level ground-truths. Further research [29]
also emphasizes the great importance of image depth (D)
information by proposing RGB-D-based SOD models. Be-
sides, similar to JUDD-A [13] (image SOD), there are two
video-based SOD datasets [14, 15] which also apply ﬁxations
to aid the manual annotation of salient objects, thus providing
new ideas for the future SOD dataset construction.

2.2. SOD Models for 2D Images

In recent years, fully convolutional network (FCN)-based
models dominate the ﬁeld of SOD. The FCN-based archi-
tecture differentiates itself from other deep learning methods
by giving saliency maps as outputs, rather than classiﬁca-
tion scores, thus managing to predict saliency maps in a
single feed-forward process by beneﬁting from an end-to-
end learning. EGNet [17] is one of the recently proposed
top-performanced state-of-the-art models. The method is
motivated by the idea that simultaneously learning the salient
edge and object information can help improving performance
of SOD models. It models these two complementary infor-
mation with an independent network outside the VGG-based
backbone. SCRN [20] is another newly proposed SOD model
that considers the edge information. It also implements the
SOD and salient edge detection in a synchronous way, by
stacking several so-called cross reﬁnement units in an end-
to-end manner. BASNet [16] proposes residual reﬁnement
module and hybrid loss to reﬁne the salient objects bound-
aries in predicted saliency maps. PoolNet [18] considers
improving the feature extraction efﬁciency of multiple layers
of current U shape architecture by adding two new modules,
which are both designed based on simple pooling techniques.
GCPANet [21] is a more recently proposed method which
brings improvements to the traditional bottom-up/top-down
networks by proposing four new modules. CPD [19] modiﬁes
the traditional encoder-decoder framework to directly reﬁne
high-level features by generated saliency maps, without the
consideration of low-level features. The idea here is different
from PoolNet and GCPANet, which try to integrate both the

low-/high-level features. Due to the limited space, we will
not include all the SOD models in this section (see recent
benchmark studies [28] for more).

2.3. Panoramic Datasets

As topic-related, there are two types of panoramic datasets
focusing on head movement (HM) prediction and FP, respec-
tively. Datasets such as 360-VHMD [30], VR-VQA48 [31]
and PVS-HM [32] contain only head tracking data, while
Salient!360 [2], Stanford360 [1], VQA-OV [3], VR-scene [4]
and 360-Saliency [5] provide ground-truth eye ﬁxations. Be-
sides, 360-SOD [6] is a newly proposed omnidirectional im-
age dataset for SOD. However, the salient objects are labeled
with pure human judgements, rather than ﬁxation-based guid-
ance. Besides, the dataset does not provide instance-level
ground-truths or object class labels.

3. A NEW DATASET FOR PANORAMIC SOD

Fig. 2: Statistics of the proposed dataset (F-360iSOD).
In this section, we present a new ﬁxation-based 360◦ image
dataset, called F-360iSOD, which contains 107 (52 indoor/55
outdoor) panoramic images with challenging real-world daily
scenes, 1,165 salient objects (from 72 object classes) manu-
ally labeled with precise object-/instance-level masks.

3.1. Image Collection

The F-360iSOD is a small-scale 360◦ dataset with totally
107 panoramic images collected from Stanford360 [1] and
Salient!360 [2] which contain 85 and 22 equirectangular
images, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the
Stanford360 and Salient!360 are the only panoramic image
datasets that provide raw eye ﬁxation data. All the images
of the proposed F-360iSOD are presented in equirectangular
format with a size of 2048×1024 for convenient processing.

3.2. Salient Object Annotation

Inspired by the 2D SOD datasets [13–15] where ﬁxation data
are used to aid the salient object annotation, an expert is asked

to manually annotate (by tracing boundaries) the salient ob-
jects with both the object-/instance-level masks on the col-
lected equirectangular images, under the guidance of ﬁxation
maps convoluted by a Gaussian with a standard deviation em-
pirically set to 3.34◦ of visual angle [2] (note that each of
the Gaussian-smoothed ﬁxation maps is thresholded with an
adaptive saliency value to keep the top one-10th of each self
before shown to the annotator). The whole annotation pro-
cess has been repeated three times to pass the quality check
implemented by two other experts, for the ﬁnal ground-truths.
Besides, nine images without any salient object annotations
are kept in F-360iSOD, to avoid the common bias of 2D SOD
datasets (as mentioned in [33]), brought by an assumption that
there is at least one salient object in each of the image.

3.3. Dataset Statistics

In F-360iSOD, each of the salient object belongs to one spe-
ciﬁc class. Generally, there are 1,165 salient objects from 72
categories, thus reﬂecting 7 aspects (human, text, vehicle, ar-
chitecture, artwork, animal and daily stuff) of the real-world
common scenes (Fig. 2). The person category occupies the
largest proportion with a number of instances of 386; other
relative large object classes include painting, text, building,
person face and car, with a number of instances of 92, 89, 86,
75 and 72, respectively.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

4.1. Dataset Split

The F-360iSOD consists of one training set and two test-
ing set, which are denoted as F-360iSOD-train, F-360iSOD-
testA and F-360iSOD-testB, respectively. The F-360iSOD-
train contains 68 equirectangular images from the Salient!360
[2], while the F-360iSOD-testA collects the remaining 17 (85
in total). Besides, the F-360iSOD-testB is established to en-
able the cross-testing for SOD models, with 22 images from
another panoramic image dataset (Stanford360 [1]).

4.2. Projection Methods

By wearing HMDs, people are able to freely rotate their head
to make multiple viewports focusing on the attractive regions
of the surrounding 360◦ content. Based on this prior knowl-
edge, we apply cubemap projection (where a 360◦ image is
projected into 6 rectangular patches) to process 68 panoramic
images (from F-360iSOD-train) with multiple rotation angles
(0◦, 30◦, 60◦ both horizontally and vertically [27]). Thus, we
gain 54 (6×3×3) patches representative of multiple ﬁelds of
view for each of the 360◦ image. 3672 (54×68) 2D patches
(256×256) are therefore generated and used as inputs for the
ﬁne-tuning of 2D SOD models.

4.3. Evaluation Metrics

To measure the agreement between manually labeled ground-
truths and model predictions, we adopt ﬁve widely used SOD

metrics: F-measure curves [22], weighted Fβ measure (Fbw)
[23], mean absolute error (MAE) [25], structural measure (S-
measure) [24] and enhanced-alignment measure (E-measure)
curves [26]. Note that the β2 is set to 0.3 in F-measure and
Fbw, aiming to emphasize more on precision as suggested in
[22]. F-measure, MAE and Fbw address the pixel-wise errors,
while S-measure evaluates the structural similarity between
predicted saliency maps and binary ground-truths :

S = α×So + (1 − α) × Sr,

(1)

where So and Sr denote the object-/region-aware structure
similarities, respectively; α is empirically set to 0.7 (α = 0.5
in 2D) to attach more importance on object structure, based on
the observation that panoramic images are usually dominated
by small salient objects distributed over the whole image (e.g.,
Fig. 1), rather than one or multiple spatially connected fore-
ground objects located at the center of the image. E-measure
is a more recently proposed SOD metric which combines both
the pixel-/image-level information:

QF M =

1
W × H

ΣW

i=1ΣH

j=1φF M (x, y),

(2)

where the φF M means the enhanced alignment matrix; the H
and M are the height and width of the foreground map.

4.4. Benchmarking Results

Fig. 3: F-measure curves and E-measure curves obtained by
six state-of-the-art SOD models on the F-360iSOD.

In our study, each of the SOD model is ﬁne-tuned on the F-
360iSOD-train with an initial learning rate of one-10th of the
default, and a batch size of 1. The training process will stop
as the S-measure value on the F-360iSOD-testA starts to go
down. As a result, it takes about 20 epochs for BASNet [16],
EGNet [17], CPD [19] and SCRN [20] to converge, while
70 for PoolNet [18] and 15 for GCPANet [21]. The quan-
titative and qualitative comparison between the six state-of-
the-art 2D SOD models on both the F-360iSOD-testA/B are
illustrated in Table. 1, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.

4.5. Discussions

Features of 360◦ datasets. All the benchmarking models are
constrained to some extent on the proposed F-360iSOD, even
though achieving high performances in 2D SOD [16–21].
The limitation is mainly due to the challenges brought by the
features of 360◦ dataset, such as equirectangular projection-
induced distortions, small objects and clutter scenes, etc.
Fixation-based complexity analysis. Since the panoramic
images tend to contain much more scenes and objects than
2D images, the ambiguity of saliency judgements in panora-
mas should also be considered, which can be quantiﬁed by
inter observer congruency (IOC) [34] and entropy based on
ﬁxation maps, which are re-smoothed with a Gaussian with a
standard deviation of 1◦ visual angle to reﬂect human foveal
size [34]. As an image with high IOC and low entropy is usu-
ally considered to be simple, the F-360iSOD-testB should be
easier to explore when compared with the F-360iSOD-testA
(Fig. 5), from a perspective of human judgements.
Unseen object classes. All benchmarking models fail on the

F-360iSOD. The F-360iSOD-train, F-360iSOD-testA/B are
annotated in black, blue and red, respectively.

F-360iSOD-testB, mainly due to the presence of unseen ob-
ject classes in Stanford360 [1], such as sharks, bells, robots,
etc. People are capable of recognizing new object categories
when provided with high-level descriptions. This strong gen-
eralization ability is still absent in current SOD models.
Instance-level ground-truths. To the best of our knowledge,
the proposed F-360iSOD is the ﬁrst 360◦ dataset that pro-
vides instance-level semantic labels for salient objects. Fu-
ture SOD models are capable of recognizing the individual
instances from multiple classes, which is crucial for practical
applications, e.g., image captioning and scene understanding.

5. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we propose a ﬁxation-based 360◦ image
dataset (F-360iSOD), with precisely annotated salient ob-
jects/instances from multiple classes representative of real-
world daily scenes. Six recently proposed top-performanced
SOD methods are ﬁne-tuned and tested on the F-360iSOD.
Results show a limit of current 2D models when directly ap-
plied to the SOD in panoramas. We believe the F-360iSOD
can be used as one of the basic panoramic datasets and thus
supporting future 360◦ SOD model development.
