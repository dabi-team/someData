Abstract – In a previous paper we showed that localized Superluminal solutions to the

Maxwell equations exist, which propagate down (non-evanescence) regions of a metallic

cylindrical waveguide. In this paper we construct analogous non-dispersive waves prop-

agating along coaxial cables. Such new solutions, in general, consist in trains of (undis-

torted) Superluminal “X-shaped” pulses. Particular attention is paid to the construction

of ﬁnite total energy solutions. Any results of this kind may ﬁnd application in the other

ﬁelds in which an essential role is played by a wave-equation (like acoustics, geophysics,

etc.).

1. – Introduction

In a previous paper[1] we constructed localized Superluminal solutions to the Maxwell

equations propagating along (non-evanescent regions of) a metallic cylindrical waveguide.

In the present paper we are going to show that analogous solutions exist even for metallic

coaxial cables. Their interest is due to the fact that they propagate without distortion

with Superluminal group-velocity.

Let us recall that already in 1915 Bateman[2] showed Maxwell equations to admit

(besides of the ordinary solutions, endowed with speed c in vacuum) of wavelet-type

solutions, endowed in vacuum with group-velocities 0

v

c. But Bateman’s work went

practically unnoticed, with the exception of a few authors as Barut et al.[3]. (Incidentally,

≤

≤

Barut et al.

even constructed a wavelet-type solution[4] traveling with Superluminal

group-velocity V > c).

In recent times, however, many authors started to discuss the circumstance that

all wave equations admit of solutions with 0

v

: see, e.g., refs.[5]. Most of

those authors conﬁned themselves to investigate (sub- or Super-luminal) non-dispersive

≤

≤ ∞

solutions propagating in the open space only: namely, those solutions that had been called

“undistorted progressive waves” by Courant & Hilbert[6].

Among localized solutions, the most interesting appeared to be the “X-shaped waves”,

which, predicted long ago to exist within Special Relativity in its extended version[7,8],

had been mathematically constructed by Lu et al.[9] for acoustic waves, and by Ziolkowski

et al.[10] and by Recami[11] for electromagnetic waves.

Let us stress that such “X-shaped” localized solutions are Superluminal (i.e., travel

with a speed larger than c in vacuum) in the electromagnetic case; and are “Super-sonic”

(i.e., travel with a speed larger than the sound-speed in the medium) in the acoustic

case. The ﬁrst authors to produce experimentally X-shaped waves were Lu et al.[13]

for acoustics, Saari et al.[14] for optics, and Mugnai et al.[15] for microwaves. Let us

also emphasize, incidentally, that all such solutions can have an interesting role even in

seismology, and probably in the gravitational wave sector.

Notwithstanding all that work[16], it is not well understood yet what solutions —

let us now conﬁne ourselves, for simplicity, to Maxwell equations and to electromagnetic

waves only— have to enter into the play in realistic experiments using waveguides, optical

2

ﬁbers, etc.

2. – The case of a cylindrical waveguide

As we already mentioned, in ref.[1] we constructed, for the TM (transverse magnetic)

case, localized solutions to the Maxwell equations which propagate (undistorted) with

Superluminal speed along a cylindrical waveguide. Let us take advantage of the present

opportunity for calling further attention to two points, which received just a mention in

ref.[1], with regard to eq.(9) and Fig.2 therein. Namely, let us here stress that:

(i) those solutions consist in a train of pulses like the one depicted in Fig.2 of ref.[1];

and that

(ii) each of such pulses is X-shaped.

A more complete representation of the TM (and TE) non-dispersive waves, traveling down

a cylindrical waveguide, will be forwarded elsewhere.

3. – The case of a coaxial cable

Let us now examine the case of a coaxial cable (a metallic coaxial waveguide, to

ﬁx our ideas), that is, of the region delimited by two cylinders with radius ρ = r1 and
ρ = r2, respectively, and axially symmetric with respect to the z-axis: see Fig.1. We
shall consider in this article both the TM case, characterized by the Dirichlet boundary

conditions[17] (for any time instant t)

Ez(ρ = r1; t) = 0 ;

Ez(ρ = r2; t) = 0 ;

(1)

and the TE (transverse electric) case, characterized by the Neumann boundary condi-

tions[17] (for any t)

∂
∂ρ

Hz(ρ = r1; t) = 0 ;

Hz(ρ = r2; t) = 0 .

(2)

To such aims, we shall ﬁrst generalize a theorem due to Lu et al.[18] (stated and

demonstrated below, in the Appendix), which showed how to start from a solution holding

in the plane (x, y) for constructing a three-dimensional solution rigidly moving along the

z-axis with Superluminal speed V . The Lu et al.’s theorem was valid for the vacuum.

In ref.[1] we set forth its generalization for a cylindrical waveguide, while here we are

going to extend it, as we said above, for a coaxial cable. Let us ﬁrst recall what Lu et

al.’s theorem is about.

If we assume that ψ(ρ; t), with ρ

The mentioned theorem holds for the free case, so that in general it does not hold when

introducing boundary conditions. We shall see, however, that it can be extended even to

the case of a two-dimensional solution ψ valid on an annular domain, a

Let us notice right now that transformations (4), with condition (1’) or (2’), lead

to a (three-dimensional) solution rigidly traveling with Superluminal speed V = c/ cos θ

inside a coaxial cable with internal and external radius equal (no longer to a, b, but) to

r1 = a/ sin θ > a and r2 = b/ sin θ > b,
applied also in other cases, provided that the boundary conditions depend on x, y only:

respectively. The same procedure can be

as in the case, e.g., of a cable with many cylindrical (empty) tunnels inside it.

4. – The transverse magnetic (TM) case

Let us go back to the two-dimensional equation (3) with the boundary conditions

(1’). Let us choose for instance the simple initial conditions ψ(ρ; t = 0)

One can notice that the present procedure is mathematically analogous to the analysis

in expansion (10). In Fig.2 we show, e.g., the two-dimensional functions

For any practical purpose, one has of course to take a ﬁnite number N of terms
2 of
eq.(10) for ﬁxed time (t = 0) and for N = 10 (dotted line) or N = 40 (solid line). Notice

Ψ2D(ρ; t)

|

|

that when the value N is ﬁnite, the ﬁrst one of conditions (6) is no longer a delta function,

but represents a physical wave, which nevertheless is still clearly bumped (Fig.2).

It is

rather interesting that, for each value of N, one meets a diﬀerent (physical) situation; at

the extent that we obtain inﬁnite many diﬀerent families of three-dimensional solutions,

by varying the truncating value N in eq.(12) below.

Actually, by the transformations (4) we arrive from eq.(10) at the three-dimensional

Superluminal non-dispersive solution Ψ3D, propagating without distortion along a metallic
coaxial waveguide, i.e., down a coaxial cable [V > c]:

which is a sum over diﬀerent propagating modes. The fact that V = c/ cos θ > c means

6

−

≡

(once more) that the group-velocity∗ of our pulses is Superluminal. For simplicity, in our
Figures we shall put z

η.

Let us notice that transformations (4), which change —as we already know— a into

r1 = a/ sin θ and b into r2 = b/ sin θ, are such that the maximum of Ψ3D is got for the
value ρ0/ sin θ of ρ. However, solution (12) does automatically satisfy on the cylinders
with radius r1 and r2 the conditions [Ψ3D ≡

Ez]:

Ψ3D(ρ = a/ sin θ, z; t) = Ψ3D(ρ = b/ sin θ, z; t) = 0 .

Till now, Ψ3D has represented the electric ﬁeld component Ez. Let us add that in

the TM case[20]:

As we mentioned above, for any truncating value N in expansion (10), we get a diﬀer-

ent physical situation: In a sense, we excite in a diﬀerent way the two-dimensional annular

membrane, obtaining (via Lu et al.’s theorem) diﬀerent three-dimensional solutions, which

correspond[1] to nothing but summation (12) truncated at the value N.

In Figs.3a,b, we show a single (X-shaped) three-dimensional pulse Ψ3D with θ = 84o,

and N = 10 or N = 40, respectively.

In Fig.4, by contrast, we depict a couple of elements of the train of X-shaped pulses

represented by eq.(12), for θ = 45o and N = 40.

∗Let us recall that the group-velocity is well deﬁned only when the pulse has a clear bump in space;
dω/dβ, quantity β being the wavenumber,
but it can be calculated by the approximate relation vg
only when some extra conditions are satisﬁed (namely, when ω as a function of β is also clearly bumped).
In the present case the group-velocity is very well deﬁned, but cannot be evaluated through that simple
relation, since ω is a discrete function of β: cf. eq.(9) and Sect.6, eq.(22), below.

In Fig.5 the orthogonal projection is moreover shown of a single pulse (of the solution
in Fig.4) onto the (ρ, z) plane for t = 0, with θ = 45o and N = 40. Quantities ρ and η
are always in centimeters.

5. – The transverse electric (TE) case

In the TE case, one has to consider the two-dimensional equation (3) with the bound-

ary conditions (2’), while the initial conditions (6) can remain the same.

As in Sect.4, one gets —still for axial symmetry in cylindrical co-ordinates— the

following solution to eq.(3):

are now to be obtained by the new relation

J1(kna)
N1(kna)

=

J1(knb)
N1(knb)

.

Again, the initial conditions (6) entail that

An Rn(ρ) = δ(ρ

(14)

ρ0), and

Bn Rn(ρ) =

−

0, so that all the coeﬃcients Bn vanish, and one gets the two-dimensional solution

6. – Rederivation of our results from the standard theory of waveguide prop-

agation

Lu’s theorem is certainly a very useful tool to build up localized solutions to Maxwell

equations: nevertheless, due to the novelty of our previous results, it may be worthwhile

to outline an alternative derivation[1] of them which can sound more familiar. To such

an aim, we shall follow the procedure introduced in ref.[1].

9

For the sake of simplicity, let us limit ourselves to the domain of TM (transverse

magnetic) modes. When a solution in terms of the longitudinal electric component, Ez,
is sought, one has to deal with the boundary condition Ez = 0; we shall look, moreover, for
axially symmetric solutions (i.e., independent of the azimuth variable, ϕ): Such choices

could be easily generalized, just at the cost of increasing the mathematical complexity.

Quantity Ez is then completely equivalent to the scalar variable Ψ
previous analysis.

Let us look for solutions of the form[1]

(18)

where R(ρ) is assumed to be a function of the radial coordinate ρ only, and K is a

normalization constant. Here we call c the velocity of light in the medium ﬁlling the

coaxial waveguide, supposing it nondispersive. The (angular) frequency ω is for the

moment arbitrary.

By inserting expression (18) into the Maxwell equation for Ez, one obtains[1]

dρ + ρ2 Ω2 R(ρ) = 0 ;

whose only solution, which is ﬁnite on the waveguide axis,

is

R(ρ) =

−

N0(ωa/c) J0(ωρ sin θ/c)

J0(ωa/c) N0(ωρ sin θ/c), which is analogous to eq.(8).

By imposing the boundary conditions R(ρ) = 0 for ρ = r1 = a/ sin θ and ρ = r2 =

b/ sin θ , one gets the acceptable frequencies from the characteristic equation:

J0(ωna/c)
N0(ωna/c)

=

J0(ωnb/c)
N0(ωnb/c)

,

(20)

so that one has a diﬀerent function Rn(ρ) for each value of ωn. Therefore, assuming[1]
an arbitrary parameter θ, we ﬁnd that, for every mode supported by the waveguide and

labeled by the index n, there is just one frequency at which the assumed dependence (18)

on z and t is physically realizable. Let us show such a solution to be the standard one

known from classical electrodynamics. In fact, by inserting[1] the allowed frequencies ωn
into the complete expression of the mode, we have:

.

By identifying β(ωn)
ωn cos θ/c, as suggested by eq.(21), and remembering the expres-
sion for ωn given by eq.(20), the ordinary dispersion relation is got[1]. We have therefore
veriﬁed that every term in the expansion (12) is a solution to Maxwell equations not

≡

diﬀerent from the usual one.

The uncommon feature of our solution (12) is that, given a particular value of θ,

the phase-velocity of all its terms is always the same, it being independent of the mode

index n:

Vph =

−1

β(ωn)

"

ωn #

=

c
cos θ

.

In such a case it is well-known that the group-velocity of the pulse equals the phase-

velocity[22]: and in our case is the velocity tout court of the localized pulse.

With reference to Fig.9, we can easily see[1] that all the allowed values of ωn can be
calculated by determining the intersections of the various branches of the dispersion rela-

tion with a straight line, whose slope depends on θ only. By using suitable combinations

of terms, corresponding to diﬀerent indices n, as in our eq.(12), it is possible to describe

a disturbance having a time-varying proﬁle[1], as already shown in Figs.3-4 above. Each

pulse thus displaces itself rigidly, with a velocity v

vg equal to Vph.
It should be repeated that the velocity v (or group-velocity vg ≡
responding to eq.(9) is not to be evaluated by the ordinary formula vg ≃

≡

v) of the pulses cor-

dω/dβ (valid for

11

 
quasi-monochromatic signals). This is at variance with the common situation in optical

and microwave communications, when the signal is usually an “envelope” superimposed

to a carrier wave whose frequency is generally much higher than the signal bandwidth. In

that case the standard formula for vg yields the correct velocity to deal with (e.g., when
propagation delays are studied). Our case, on the contrary, is much more reminiscent of

a baseband modulated signal, as those studied in ultrasonics: the very concept of a carrier

becomes meaningless here, as the discrete “harmonic” components have widely diﬀerent

frequencies[1].

Let us ﬁnally remark[1] that similar considerations could be extended to all the situ-

ations where a waveguide supports several modes. Tests at microwave frequencies should

be rather easy to perform; by contrast, experiments in the optical domain would face the

problem of the limited extension of the spectral windows corresponding to not too large

attenuation, even if work[23] is in progress in many directions.

Moreover, results of the kind presented in this paper, as well as in refs.[1,11,12], may

ﬁnd application in the other ﬁelds in which an essential role is played by a wave-equation

(like acoustics, seismology, geophysics, and relativistic quantum mechanics, possibly.).

7. – How to get ﬁnite total energy solutions

We shall go on following the standard formalism of Sect.6; what we are going to do

holds, however, for both the TM and the TE case. Let us anticipate that, in order to get

ﬁnite total energy solutions (FTES), we shall have to replace each characteristic frequency

ωn [cf. eq.(9), or eq.(14) or rather Fig.9] by a small frequency band ∆ω centered at ωn,
always choosing the same ∆ω independently of n. In fact, since all the modes entering the
Fourier-type expansion (12), or (16), possess the same phase-velocity Vph ≡
each small bandwidth packet associated with ωn will possess the same group-velocity
vg = c2/Vph, so that we shall have as a result a wave whose envelope travels with the
subluminal group-velocity vg. However, inside the subluminal envelope, one or more pulses
will be travelling with the dual (Superluminal) speed V = c2/vg. Such well-localized peaks
have nothing to do with the ordinary (sinusoidal) carrier-wave, and will be regarded as

V = c/ cos θ,

constituting the relevant wave. Before going on, let us mention that previous work related

12

to FTESs can be found —as far as we know— only in refs.[24] and [12].

Formally, to get FTESs, let us consider the ordinary (three-dimensional) solutions for

a coaxial cable:

ψn(ρ, z; t) = Kn Rn(ρ) cos [β(ω) z

ωt] ,

−

(23)

where coeﬃcients Kn coincide with the An given by eq.(11) or eq.(15’) in the TM ot TE
cases, respectively; and functions Rn are again given by eq.(8) or eq.(13’), respectively;
since the values kn,

kn ≡

ω2
c2 −

β2 ,

(24)

are equal to those found via the (two-dimensional) eq.(9) in the TM and via eq.(14) in

the TE case, simply multiplied by sin θ [because of the fact that, when going on from

the two-dimensional membrane to the three-dimensional coaxial cable, the internal and

external radia are equal (no longer to a, b, but) to r1 = a/ sin θ and r2 = b/ sin θ].

Let us now consider the spectral functions

Wn ≡

q2(ω

−

(25)

with the same weight-parameter q, so that ∆ω too is the same [according to our deﬁnitions,

at the price of incresing a little the mathematical
Fig.9). In any case, one could integrate from 0 to
complexity: we are preferring the present formalism for simplicity’s sake.

value of n in the above sum) expand the function β(ω) in the neighbourhood of the

corresponding ωn-value:

β(ω)

∂β
∂ω (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
where β0n = ωn cos θ, and the further terms are neglected since ∆ω is assumed to be small.
Notice that, because of relations (26) and (24), in eq.(28) the group-velocities, given by

ωn) + ...

It is rather interesting to notice that the FTES (29) is related to the X-shaped waves,

Let us go back to the important relation (28’), and to the discussion about it started

at the beginning of this Section. Let us repeat that, if we choose the ωn-values as in Fig.9,
all our small-bandwidth packets, centered at the ωn’s, get the same phase-velocity V > c
and therefore the same group-velocity vg < c [since for metallic waveguides the quantities
∂ω/∂β, so that it is V vg = c2].
n = ω2
k2
This means that the envelope of solution (29)-(30) moves with slower-than-light speed;
the envelope length‡ ∆l depending on the chosen ∆ω, and being therefore proportional
to qvg.

β2 are constant for each mode, and vg ≡

n/c2

−

However, inside such an envelope, one gets a train of (X-shaped) pulses —having
nothing to do with the ordinary carrier wave,§ as we already mentioned— traveling with
the Superluminal speed V . An interesting point is that we can choose the envelope length
so that it contains only one (X-shaped wave) peak: the Superluminal speed V = c2/vg of
such a pulse can then be regarded as the actual velocity of the wave. In order to have

just one peak inside the envelope, the envelope length is to be chosen smaller than the

distance between two successive peaks of the (inﬁnite total energy) train (12), or (16).

It should be noted, at last, that the amplitude of such a single X-shaped pulse (which

remains conﬁned inside the envelope) ﬁrst increases, and afterwards decreases, while trav-

eling; till when it practically disappears. While the considered pulse tends to vanish on

the right (i.e., under the right tail of the envelope), a second pulse starts to be created

on the left; and so on. From eq.(30) it is clear, in fact, that our ﬁnite-energy solution is

nothing but an (inﬁnite-energy) solution of the type in eq.(12), or in eq.(16), multiplied

by a Gaussian function.

In Figs.10 all such a behaviour is clearly depicted.

Acknowledgements

‡One may call “envelope length” the distance between the two points in which the envelope height is,

for instance, 10% of its maximum height.

§Actually, they can be regarded as a sum of carrier waves.

See the text. Again, the dotted line corresponds to N = 10, and the solid line to N = 40.

the TE case) onto the plane (ρ, z) for t = 0, with θ = 60o and N = 40.

Fig.9 — Dispersion curves for the symmetrical TM0n modes in a perfect coaxial waveg-
uide, and location of the frequencies whose corresponding modes possess the same phase-

[Actually, the phase-velocity c/ cos θ of all the terms in expansion (12) is always

the same, being independent of the mode index n: In such a case, it is known that the

group-velocity of the pulse (namely, the velocity tout court of the localized pulse) becomes

equal to the phase-velocity.]

Figs.10 — Time evolution of a ﬁnite total energy solution. Choosing q = 0.606 s, c = 1,
N = 40, a = 1 cm, b = 3 cm and θ = 45o, there is only one X-shape pulse inside
the subluminal envelope: see the text. The pulse and envelope velocities are given by

V = 1/cosθ and vg = 1/V : The superluminal speed V = 1/vg of such a pulse can be
regarded, of course, as the actual velocity of the wave. Figures (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)

and (f) show a complete cycle of the pulse; they correspond to the time instants t = 0,

t = 0.5 s, t = 1 s, t = 3 s, t = 3.5 s, and t = 4 s, respectively.
