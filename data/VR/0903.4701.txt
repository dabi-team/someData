ABSTRACT
We present a spectroscopic survey of candidate red giant branch stars in the extended
star cluster, EC4, discovered in the halo of M31 from our CFHT/MegaCam survey,
overlapping the tidal streams, Stream ‘Cp’ and Stream ‘Cr’. These observations used
the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) mounted on the Keck II
◦
telescope to obtain spectra around the CaII triplet region with ∼ 1.3
A resolution.
Six stars lying on the red giant branch within 2 core-radii of the centre of EC4 are
found to have an average vr = −287.9+1.9
−2.7 kms−1, tak-
ing instrumental errors into account. The resulting mass-to-light ratio for EC4 is
M/L= 6.7+15
−6.7 M⊙/ L⊙, a value that is consistent with a globular cluster within the
1σ errors we derive. From the summed spectra of our member stars, we ﬁnd EC4 to
be metal-poor, with [Fe/H]=-1.6±0.15. We discuss several formation and evolution
scenarios which could account for our kinematic and metallicity constraints on EC4,
and conclude that EC4 is most comparable with an extended globular cluster. We also
compare the kinematics and metallicity of EC4 with Stream ‘Cp’ and Stream ‘Cr’, and
ﬁnd that EC4 bears a striking resemblance to Stream ‘Cp’ in terms of velocity, and that
the two structures are identical in terms of both their spectroscopic and photometric
metallicities. From this we conclude that EC4 is likely related to Stream ‘Cp’.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years, the number, depth and coverage
of both photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the Lo-
cal Group has increased dramatically, resulting in the dis-
covery of a myriad of globular clusters (GCs) and dwarf

Observatory, which is operated as a scientiﬁc partnership among

nia and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The

spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) orbiting within its gravitational
potential. And whilst traditionally, satellite objects such as
these have been somewhat simple to classify in terms of
their half-light radii (rh ∼2-5pc for GCs cf. ∼few 100pc for
dSphs) and their dark matter content via the calculation of
their mass-to-light (M/L) ratios (M/L∼< 3 for GCs, which
are not considered to contain dark matter, cf. M/L∼>10 for
the dark matter dominated dSphs), recent discoveries of low-
surface brightness objects with properties common to both
GCs and dSphs have caused this historical divide to blur.
SDSS has been instrumental in this process within the con-
ﬁnes of our own Milky Way (MW), where in addition to
a host of dSphs, a number of low luminosity objects have

been discovered out in the halo with properties that see
them encroaching on the void in the size-luminosity param-
eter space between GCs and dSphs (Willman et al. 2005;
Belokurov et al. 2007; Simon & Geha 2007; Walsh et al.
2007; Belokurov et al. 2008). Similarly, wide-ﬁeld photo-
metric surveys of M31 and its extensive halo conducted
with the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide-Field Camera and
CFHT MegaCam (Ibata et al. 2001; Ferguson et al. 2002;
Ibata et al. 2007) have revealed equally puzzling entities
(Huxor et al. 2005; Mackey et al. 2006; Huxor et al. 2008),
as well as vast numbers of more “typical” GCs and dSphs
(Chapman et al. 2005; Martin et al. 2006; Ibata et al. 2007;
Huxor et al. 2008; Irwin et al. 2008; McConnachie et al.
2008).

Some of the more notable of these recent MW discover-
ies include the unusual objects Willman I, Segue I, Bootes
II and Leo V, all of which are low luminoisty objects (-
2> MV >-4.5), with half light radii between ∼ 20 − 40pc
(Willman et al. 2005; Belokurov et al. 2007; Walsh et al.
2007; Belokurov et al. 2008). There is also some debate as
to whether such objects are dark matter dominated, which
would suggest that they are members of the dSph population
or if they are merely unusually extended clusters, with no
sizeable dark matter component. In the case of Bootes II and
Willman I, these unusual combinations of size and luminos-
ity are also accompanied by internal metallicity dispersions
and popualtion variations (though in the case of Willman I,
this is subject to debate, see Siegel et al. 2008), traits that
are associated primarily with dSphs, not GCs. Also, some
of these faint satellites, such as Ursa Major II and Coma
Berenices, are observed to have mean metallicites that are
signiﬁcantly higher than would be expected for objects of
their luminosity (Simon & Geha 2007). It is important to
point out that such studies are hampered by low-number

statistics, but the results certainly indicate the existence of
an interesting population of low surface brightness satellites
within the Local Group. Similarly, in M31 a large popula-
tion of unusual extended clusters (hereafter ECs1) has been
uncovered in the outskirts of the halo that cannot easily be
classiﬁed as GCs or dSphs (Huxor et al. 2005, 2008). Objects
analogous to these ECs have also been discovered around
other nearby galaxies. Stonkut˙e et al. (2008) have identiﬁed
one such cluster in M33 and Hwang et al. (2005) found 3 re-
mote ECs in NGC 6822. The luminosities (−4 > MV > −8)
and half light radii (10–35 pc) of these objects places them
in an intriguing position in size-luminosity parameter space,
populating what was previously observed as a gulf between
dSphs and classical GCs (see ﬁg. 1).

Constraining the nature and properties of these low lu-
minosity objects is important to our understanding of galaxy
evolution and hierarchical structure formation. If they are
the tidally-stripped cores of dSphs, such as has been sug-
gested for Milky Way cluster, ω Cen, and the M31 clus-
ter, G1 (Bekki & Freeman (2003); Bekki & Chiba (2004);
Ideta & Makino (2004); Tsuchiya et al. (2004)), they are
relics of previous accretion events within their host galaxy.
If, however, they reside in the extreme tail of log-normal
size distribution of GCs they are suﬃciently unusual to war-
rant further investigation. A serious problem in determin-
ing the properties, such as mass and metallicity, of these
systems is correctly identifying which of the observed stars
are cluster members. With spectroscopic information, one
can separate stars that are kinematically associated with
the cluster from those that merely lie coincident with its

1 We emphasize that while we refer to our objects as “extended
clusters” (ECs), no judgment on the nature of these systems is
implied by this terminology.

Colour-Magnitude Diagram (CMD), and allow us to de-
rive dynamical constraints. In addition, the metallicity of
individual stars can be measured from the spectra of the
likely members via an inspection of the Near-Infrared CaII
lines (CaT), providing a measure for [Fe/H] that is inde-
pendent of the photometrically derived value. We can also
use the central velocity dispersion of the cluster to estimate
the instantaneous mass of the system, assuming it is per-
fectly spherical and in virial equilibrium (e.g. Illingworth
1976, Richstone & Tremaine 1986). One can then compare
the M/L ratio of ECs and other derived properties to those
expected of GCs and dSphs in order to determine if they
can be reconciled entirely with the global properties of ei-
ther, or if they are indeed members of another type of stellar
association that bridges the gap between the two.

To this end, we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of
the newly discovered extended clusters found in the halos of
M31 and M33 using the DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck II
to derive radial velocities and metallicities of RGB stars.
In this contribution, we discuss spectroscopic observations
in EC4. EC4 was discovered within the CFHT-MegaCam
survey (Huxor et al. 2008, Ibata et al. 2007) at a projected
radius of 60 kpc (coordinates presented in Table 1). It has
a half light radius of 33.7 pc and an absolute magnitude of
MV =-6.6 (Mackey et al. 2006), placing it in an usual posi-
tion in terms of its size and luminosity as can be seen in
Fig. 1.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS

The spectroscopic ﬁelds discussed in this paper are located
at a projected distance of ∼60 kpc from the center of M31.
The ﬁelds sit within Stream ‘C’presented in the Ibata et al.
(2007) M31 extended halo analysis,

Multi-object spectroscopic observations with the Keck-
II telescope and DEIMOS (Davis et al. 2003) were obtained
in photometric conditions with ∼ 0.8′′ seeing in Sept. 2004.
Target stars were chosen by colour/magnitude selection as
described in Ibata et al. (2005), ﬁrst selecting likely RGB
stars in M31 over all metallicities, and ﬁlling the remain-
ing mask slits with any other suitable stellar objects in the
ﬁeld. Two spectroscopic masks (F25 and F26 from the table
in Chapman et al. 2006) targeted the ﬁeld of the extended
cluster EC4 (Huxor et al. 2008). A combined total of 212
independent stars in both masks were observed in standard
DEIMOS slit-mask mode (Davis et al. 2003) using the high
resolution 1200 line/mm grating, and 1′′ width slitlets. Ten
of these target stars were speciﬁcally selected from HST pho-
tometry of EC4 to lie within the cluster. The top left panel of
Figure 2 shows the map of HST stars derived from imaging
in Mackey et al. (2006), and depicts the position of our spec-
troscopic candidates within the cluster. Our instrumental
setting covered the observed wavelength range from ∼ 7000–

A. Exposure time was 60 min, split into 20 min integra-
tions. The DEIMOS-DEEP2 pipeline (Newman et al. 2004)
designed to reduce data of this type accomplishes tasks of
debiassing, ﬂat-ﬁelding, extracting, wavelength-calibrating
and sky-subtracting the spectra.

The radial velocities of the stars in all these ﬁelds were
then measured with respect to spectra of standard stars ob-
served during the observing runs. By ﬁtting the peak of the

cross-correlation function, an estimate of the radial veloc-
ity accuracy was obtained for each radial velocity measure-
ment. The accuracy of these data, as estimated from the
CaT cross-correlation, varies with magnitude, having uncer-
tainties of < 10 km s−1 for most of the stars. The CMDs, ve-
locity errors, velocity histograms, and metallicities for these
ﬁelds are shown in Figure 2.

We address Galactic contamination in our spectroscop-
ically identiﬁed stars in a manner similar to Koch et al.
(2008), using a combination of radial velocity and the equiv-
alent width (EW) of Naiλ8183,8195 which is sensitive to sur-
face gravity, and is accordingly very weak in M31 RGB star
spectra, but can be strong in Galactic dwarfs (Schiavon et
al. 1997). The Besan¸con Galaxy model (Robin et al. 2004)
predicts that few contaminating foreground dwarfs with
vr < −160 kms−1 (as shown in Ibata et al. 2005) are present
in a standard DEIMOS ﬁeld (16.7’ x 5’), and the chance of
contamination within the small region of EC4 is almost nil.
This is further supported by the fact that very few RGB can-
didates at these velocities show any signiﬁcant Naiλ8183,8195
absorption lines, whereas stars with −160 to 0 kms−1 veloc-
ity show strong Nai absorption on average, consistent with
the ﬁndings of Guhathakurta et al. (2006), Gilbert et al.
(2006) and Koch et al. (2008). For this study, we ignore all
stars with vr > −160 kms−1, and we remove any stars from
our sample which have a summed EW(Naiλ8183,8195)> 0.8
in the velocity range vr < −160 kms−1.

In Fig. 2, we present the CFHT MegaCam colours of all
stars within our two DEIMOS ﬁelds, transformed into Lan-
dolt V and I using a two stage process detailed in Ibata et al.
(2007) and McConnachie et al. (2004). Ten stars were se-
lected to lie within EC4 by their colours and positions from
the HST CMD, also shown in Fig. 2. Of these ten, one was
subsequently identiﬁed as a galaxy in the HST/ACS image,
while another lies well oﬀ the cluster RGB, likely due to
contamination in the ground-based CFHT-MegaCam imag-
ing aﬀecting the colour measurements. The remaining eight
stars lie close to the cluster centre and fall along the top of
the narrow RGB from the HST imagery.

In analyzing the DEIMOS spectroscopy, one targeted
star lay exactly on the EC4 CMD, but had a discrepant ve-
locity from the others. Closer examination of the spectrum
revealed detections of the ﬁrst and second CaT lines with
a velocity of -277.3 kms−1, whereas the automated software
pipeline derived a cross-correlation ﬁt to larger skyline resid-
uals. We include this eighth star in the catalog as a viable
member of EC4, although we do not include it in subsequent
analysis owing to its poorly deﬁned velocity with respect to
other member stars; we list the properties of all these stars
in table 1.

2.1 Velocity accuracy

Velocities for these EC4 stars were initially presented in
Chapman et al. (2008), but since publication, we have dis-
covered a systematic eﬀect that was introduced into some of
our spectra from a crowding of slits within the EC4 region.
This caused slits over some stars to be truncated resulting
in a poor sky subtraction. The outcome was a broadening of
the third Calcium Triplet line in a number of spectra, aﬀect-
ing the automated velocity cross correlations. We have since
re-calibrated both our velocity and [Fe/H] calculations to

isochrones have been shifted to the average distance modulus of EC4, 24.31 (Mackey et al. 2006). The isochrone at [Fe/H]=-1.8 provides
the closest match for the likely EC4 stars in the left panel, and in the right panel while the more metal-rich Stream ‘Cr’ component can
be clearly seen at around [Fe/H]=-1.0, we also see an RGB component persisting at [Fe/H]=-1.8, which we attribute to Stream ‘Cp’.
Bottom left panel: CFHT-MegaCam CMD and radial velocity uncertainties of the observed stars in the Stream ‘Cr’/Stream ‘Cp’ ﬁelds.
Stars likely belonging to EC4 (red ﬁlled circles) and Stream ‘Cp’ (blue ﬁlled squares) are highlighted. The isochrones are also from the
Dotter et al. (2008) set, and correspond to (from left to right) -2.0, -1.5, -1.25 and -1.0. Bottom right panel: The velocities of observed
stars in the F25/F26 ﬁelds are shown in the top panel as a histogram, with EC4 member stars highlighted as a heavy histogram. The
stellar halo velocity dispersion (σv =125 kms−1) from Chapman et al. (2006) is shown normalized to the expected 9 halo stars at this
position from Ibata et al. (2007). To diﬀerentiate EC4 stars from the ﬁeld, we additionally plot the velocities against their radius from
the EC4 center in the centre panel, referencing the symbols to the CMD plot. In the lower panel, photometrically derived [Fe/H] from
CFHT-MegaCam is shown as a function of radial velocity, again referenced in symbol type to the CMD plot.

giving us more robust kinematics for EC4 than presented
previously.

While the cross-correlation errors for these CaT mea-
surements suggest relatively small velocity errors, an inde-

pendent check can be made on the 56 radial velocities of
stars lying in spectroscopic masks of both ﬁelds F25 and
F26. Velocity diﬀerences are shown in Fig. 3 highlighting
those corresponding to Stream ‘C’ (3 stars), Stream ‘D’ (2
stars), EC4 (3 stars), background halo (2 stars), and Milky

Way foreground (46 stars). Agreement between observing
nights for these stars is generally found within the 1σ er-
rors of the radial velocity measurements, suggesting that no
signiﬁcant systematic errors are present from instrumental
setup night to night. The dispersion in velocity diﬀerences is
∼6 kms−1 for both the M31 sample and the Milky Way sam-
ple taken separately. For these 56 stars, we have taken as the
radial velocity the error-weighted average of the measure-
ment from the two nights. We also display in the right-hand
panel of Fig. 3 a histogram of the velocity diﬀerences for
the overlap stars. Normalizing this histogram with respect
to the individual errors of the stars within the ﬁeld results in
a distribution that is reasonably ﬁt by a Gaussian centered
on -0.05 kms with a dispersion of 1.2 kms, suggesting that
instrumental errors night-to-night do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
derived values of velocity. We also investigated the correla-
tion between velocity diﬀerence and slit position along the
DEIMOS mask to see if there are any signiﬁcant rotational
eﬀects present that could cause a misalignment of the slits
from their target stars and introduce skewed velocity mea-
surements across the mask. A slight trend is observed across
the ﬁeld, likely due to rotation of the mask, but the eﬀect
◦
is to impose a drift of ∼ 0.2
A, corresponding to a velocity
of 8.1 kms−1 across the mask as a whole, or just 2 kms−1
for the region of EC4, which is well within typical velocity
errors.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Kinematics

Figure 2 shows the CFHT-MegaCam CMD and radial veloc-
ity uncertainties of the observed stars in the EC4 ﬁelds. Stars
likely belonging to EC4 are shown in red, allowing metallic-
ity comparison to the Dotter et al. (2008) isochrones. Fig-
ure 2 displays the stars as a velocity histogram, highlighting
the probable EC4 member stars as deﬁned by their veloci-
ties. The kinematics for EC4 are strikingly similar to those of
Stream ‘Cp’as discussed in Chapman et al. (2008), making it
diﬃcult to diﬀerentiate between the two objects on velocity
alone. However, owing to the low density of Stream ‘Cp’stars
within the 83.5 arcmin2 DEIMOS ﬁeld (5-7 stars associ-
ated to Stream ‘Cp’by Chapman et al. (2008)), it is unlikely
that a contaminating stream star would be found within the
∼ 0.8′ tidal radius of the cluster and hence we can use the
radial distance from the centre of the cluster as a discrim-
inant between the two populations. This is also plotted in
Fig. 2. Finally photometrically derived metallicities, [Fe/H]
= log(Z/Z⊙), are computed for the stars by interpolating be-
tween 10 Gyr old Dartmouth isochrones (Dotter et al. 2008).
The ﬁxed age and α-abundance of +0.4 adopted for metal-
licity comparison to the ﬁducials will of course introduce a
systematic uncertainty if signiﬁcant variations are present.
These photometric metallicities are plotted in Fig. 2 as a
function of radial velocity.

Figure 2 shows that eight of the stars targeted in the
cluster, EC4, can be kinematically identiﬁed with a distri-
bution of velocities centered at vr ∼-285kms−1. We exclude
one of these from the following kinematic analysis as the
noise in the spectrum is too high for us to ascertain a reli-
able velocity for the star. Of the remaining seven candidates,

six lie within 2 core radii of the cluster centre and therefore
are the most plausible EC4 members. The seventh star lies
further out at ∼ 4 core radii, a distance within which 99% of
the light of the cluster is contained, making its membership
uncertain. For this reason, we omit this star in the following
analysis also. The individual spectra for both plausible and
tentative members are shown in Fig. 5

The velocities for these six remaining stars are consis-
tent with a vr = -287.9+1.9
−2.4 kms−1 and an instrumentally
resolved σv,corr = 2.7+4.2
−2.7 kms−1 after accounting for veloc-
ity measurement errors in the maximum-likelihood sense de-
scribed previously (see e.g., Martin et al. (2007) for details
of the technique). Figure 4 shows the relative likelihood dis-
tribution of vr and σv when marginalizing with respect to
the other parameter (the quoted uncertainties correspond
to region containing the central 68.3% of the distribution
function). The parameter range that contains 68.3%, 95.4%
and 99.73% of the probability distribution (the 1, 2 and 3×
σ uncertainties) are highlighted with dashed lines. The plot
shows that the velocity dispersion of EC4 is consistent with
zero at the 1σ level.

Taking the measured value for the integrated light of
EC4, MV = −6.6 ± 0.1 (Mackey et al. 2006), we can as-
sess the dynamical mass of the cluster if we assume virial
equilibrium. The mass to light ratio of a simple spherically
symmetric stellar system of central surface brightness Σ0,
half brightness radius rh, and central velocity dispersion σ0
can be estimated as:

M/L = η

9
2πG

σ2
0
Σ0rh

(1)

(Richstone & Tremaine 1986), where η is a dimensionless
parameter which has a value close to unity for many struc-
tural models.

Using the values of rh=33.7±5 pc and rc=23.8±4 pc
in Mackey et al. (2006), one can calculate a tidal radius,
rt=165±24 pc. In order to get a value for central sur-
face brightness, one can simply integrate the King pro-
ﬁle in two dimensions, giving an area for the cluster of
3496 pc2. Using the distance modulus from Mackey et al.
of (m − M )0 = 24.31 ± 0.14 and assuming an absolute solar
magnitude of MV =4.83, we calculate the luminosity of the
cluster to be L=3.73+0.4
−0.3x 104 L⊙. Hence we derive a value
of µ0 = 10.7 ± 0.1 L⊙ pc−2 or 23.8 mag/arcsec−2 which is
fainter than typically observed in GCs (Noyola & Gebhardt
2006) but considerably brighter than would be expected for a
dSph of similar absolute magnitude (McConnachie & Irwin
2006).

We assume the velocity dispersion we measure for EC4
is representative of σ0 as all six stars lie within 2 core radii.
This assumption would cause us, if anything, to underesti-
mate σ0 as in models of bound stellar systems, like those
assumed in the core-ﬁtting method, the velocity dispersion
decreases with distance, as our EC4 sample does marginally
within the errors. If this is the case, the result would be that
we would underestimate the M/L ratio of EC4 also.
Assuming that σv = σ0, we ﬁnd M/L= 6.7+15

−6.7 M⊙/ L⊙
(with errors denoting the 1σ bound). Comparing this re-
sult with values of dSphs of similar luminosity, we ﬁnd it
unlikely that EC4 contains a sizable dark matter contribu-
tion. It is also unlikely that EC4 is the central remnant of a
dSph that has lost the majority of its mass via tidal inter-

action with M31 or surrounding substructure, as the models
of Pe˜narrubia et al. (2008) show that severe mass loss from
a dwarf spheroidal by means of tidal stripping actually in-
creases the value of M/L. This is because the tightly bound
central dark matter “cusp” of the dwarf is more resilient to
tidal disruption than the stellar component of the galaxy,
causing the object to become more dark matter dominated.
Another possibility is that EC4 is a stellar cluster undergo-
ing tidal stripping, causing it to have an inﬂated mass-to-
light ratio in comparison to more ‘typical’ GCs (though we
note that the M/L of EC4 is consistent with this population
within its 1σ errors). Signiﬁcant tidal debris from the clus-
ter is not evident in the HST photometry of Mackey et al.
(2006), though this could be due in part to the faintness of
the cluster.

3.2 Measurements of [Fe/H]

The metallicity of the cluster can be calculated using the
spectroscopic data obtained for each member star from
the equivalent widths of the CaT lines (as described in
Ibata et al. 2005). The spectra for the six plausible mem-
bers (plus the two tentative members) is shown in Figure 5,
where velocities and individual metallicities for each candi-
date are quoted also. The spectroscopic metallicity of the
six most probable member stars range from [Fe/H]=-1.5 to
[Fe/H]=-2.2. It is important to note that the errors on the
metallicities of each individual star are quite high (of order
∼ 0.4 dex) owing to the signal-to-noise of the data.

In Fig 6 we display the combined spectra for these stars
after normalizing by continuum and smoothed with a gaus-
sian of instrumental resolution. Over-plotted in red are the
3 Gaussian ﬁts to the CaT lines (also smoothed to corre-
spond to data). The lower plot is shown for comparison and
represents a continuum-normalized model atmosphere spec-
trum from Munari et al. 2005, re-sampled to R=6000 with

8 M. Collins et al.

Figure 6. Top spectrum: A straight average of reliable spectra plotted after normalizing by continuum and smoothing using a
Gaussian. Over-plotted in red are the 3 smoothed Gaussian ﬁts to the CaT lines. Lower spectrum: For comparison, a continuum-
normalized model atmosphere spectrum from Munari et al. 2005 is shown, re-sampled to R=6000 with log(g)=1.0, [Fe/H] = -1.5, Tef f
= 4500K and shifted down by 0.5 for ease of reference

log(g)=1.0, [Fe/H] = -1.5, Tef f = 4500K and shifted down
by 0.5 for ease of reference. Using the combined spectra, an
average metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.6±0.15 is determined for
the cluster. The errors in this value correspond to the un-
certainties in the measurements of the EWs of each CaT line,
using the method described in Battaglia et al. (2008). In a
previous paper by Mackey et al. (2006), a value of [Fe/H]=
-1.84±0.20 is derived for EC4 from HST photometry, which
agrees well with our result within the quoted errors.

It is also interesting to note that 3 FeI lines (at ∼8467,

◦
∼8515 and ∼8687
A) can be seen in our summed spectra
that appear to have similar EWs as their counterparts in
the template spectrum, implying that the model is a good
ﬁt in surface gravity and temperature space to our data. The
FeI lines could also allow us to estimate chemical abundance
ratios with better spectra in the future (see Koch et al. 2008;
Kirby et al. 2008).

Photometric metallicities for the most likely members of
EC4 were also determined, shown in the lower right panel of
Fig. 2, using isochrones from the Dartmouth stellar evoul-
tion database (Dotter et al. 2008). We selected isochrones
with an age of 10 Gyr (as this was quoted as the lower limit
for the age estimate for EC4 in Mackey et al. 2006), and a
value of [α/Fe]=+0.4 as GCs are typically observed with
α-abundances between +0.2 and +0.4. Then, using data
from the MegaCam survey we interpolated between these
isochrones to determine the photometric metallicity for each
member star. Using this method, the mean metallicity for
the cluster was determined to be [Fe/H]=-1.5 with a dis-
persion of ±0.1, which is more metal rich than the value of
-1.84±0.20 found by Mackey et al. (2006). However, in their
paper, they used globular ﬁducials to obtain metallicities
whereas we have used theoretical isochrones, which could
expain this diﬀerence. Our choice of age (10 Gyr) is also
younger than typical GCs, which could cause us to over-
estimate the metallicity. This discrepancy is discussed in
greater detail in the next section.

3.3 Association with Stream ‘Cp’

From its projected position in the halo of M31, EC4 appears
to sit within the tidal stream structure, Stream ‘C’, ﬁrst re-
ported in Ibata et al. (2007). The work of Chapman et al.
(2008) and Richardson et al. (2009) has since shown that
this stream represents two superposed structures, a metal
rich Stream ‘Cr’ and a metal poor Stream ‘Cp’. It therefore
seems natural to ask whether EC4 is related to either of
these structures and, if so, what their relationship is?

From a comparison of their kinematics we ﬁnd that,
whilst Stream ‘Cr’ is the denser of these two streams in the
region of EC4 (∼3 times the density of Stream ‘Cp’), it does
not seem likely that it is related to the cluster by either its
velocity (vr=-349.5kms−1 vs. -287.9kms−1 for EC4) or its
metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.7 vs. -1.6 for EC4). However, from
the 5 stars that were unambigously identiﬁed as members
of Stream ‘Cp’, Chapman et al. determine a systemic ve-
locity for the structure of vr= -285.0+1.7
−1.8kms−1, which is
very similar to the velocity of -287.9kms−1 that we derive
here for EC4. They also found a spectroscopic metallicity
for Stream ‘Cp’ of [Fe/H]=-1.3 which, taken at face value,
is more metal-rich than the value of [Fe/H]=-1.6 that we
ﬁnd for EC4. However, on a closer inspection of the data
used to calculate the metallicity for the stream, we note
that the same broadening of the third CaT line that we see
in the EC4 stars, is also observed in the Stream ‘Cp’ spec-
tra, which will have resulted in an over-estimate of [Fe/H]
for the stream. To correct this, we recalculate the metallicity
for the stream using the ﬁrst and second lines only and ﬁnd
[Fe/H]=-1.6±0.2, which is once again in remarkable agree-
ment with our EC4 result.

Photometrically, as stated in the previous section, we
ﬁnd a mean metallicity for EC4 of [Fe/H]=-1.5±0.1. Us-
ing the same set of isochrones and applying them to the
Stream ‘Cp’ stars we measure a mean [Fe/H]=-1.4 ±0.1,
again in reasonable agreement. However given the errors
from crowding and contamination within the CFHT data
and the discrepancies between value of -1.5 we calculate here
for EC4 and that of -1.84±0.20 calculated by Mackey et al.
(2006), it is important for us to assess whether the HST data
shows a similar agreement between the two populations. As

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

the spectroscopic Stream ‘Cp’ members were not observed in
the HST pointing, we are unable to directly compare them
to the EC4 members in the HST reference frame. Instead,
we separate the EC4 stars within the HST ﬁeld from the
surrounding halo region by imposing a radial cut of 0.8’,
which is beyond the tidal radius of EC4, and compare the
CMDs for both regions. This is shown in the top right panel
of Fig 2, where we display the HST CMDs with Dartmouth
isochrones overlaid in the F606W and F814W ﬁlters, again
with an age of 10 Gyr and [α/Fe]=+0.4, at metallicities of
[Fe/H]=-2.0, -1.8, -1.5, -1.0 and -0.75. As can be seen, the
isochrone with [Fe/H]=-1.8 is the best match to the EC4
data (left panel). Turning our attention to the surrounding
ﬁeld (shown in the right hand panel), we can see the more
metal rich Stream ‘Cr’ component quite clearly, but we also
see a population persisting at [Fe/H]=-1.8. Given the dis-
tance of these stars from EC4, it is unlikely that they are
bound members of the cluster, and hence we attribute this
population to Stream ‘Cp’, showing again a good agreement
in the photometric properties of both objects.

The above ﬁndings strongly suggest that EC4 and
Stream ‘Cp’ are somehow related to one another, and it is
worth considering whether these ﬁve stream stars (and con-
sequently, the surounding HST ﬁeld stars) could be far-ﬂung
members of EC4 itself, thereby simply representing rare or
tidally disrupted members of an otherwise isolated cluster
(without an associated tidal stream). These stars lie at large
radii from EC4 (2 to 10 arcmin, or ∼ 0.5 − 2 kpc), chosen
by chance in the spectroscopic masks, and are very unlikely
to be members of EC4 itself. They would represent 15-74
core radii of EC4 (30 pc) and therefore cannot belong to the
cluster unless it is strongly disrupted, or is in fact only the
cold core component of a more diﬀuse dwarf galaxy with an
outer second component of stars. Owing to its low value of
M/L (as discussed above), it is unlikely that this is the case.
It is more probable that EC4 and the Stream ‘Cp’ stars both
constitute tidally-stripped members of the as yet undiscov-
ered stream progenitor.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1

EC4 in the context of the dwarf spheroidal
M/L to L relation

Given that EC4 encroaches on the parameter space between
typical GCs and dSphs, it is interesting to compare EC4
with other local group dSphs to see if its properties are con-
sistent with this population. A comparison is made between
EC4 and some of the known Milky Way and M31 satellites
in Figure 7, where the Mateo (1998) relation between M/L
and the luminosity of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group has
also been plotted, with the blue hatched region represent-
ing the parameter space typically occupied by GCs. Most
of the newly discovered M31 dSphs are in agreement with
the relation within reasonable errors. It is obvious that EC4
is not consistent with this relation, and would need to be
of order ∼100 times more massive than we measure here
for it to be comparable with other dwarfs of similar lumi-
nosity. This strongly implies that EC4 does not contain a
signiﬁcant quantity of dark matter, and is not a member of
the dwarf spheroidal population. Instead we ﬁnd that many

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

9

of the attributes of EC4 are more consistent with those of
a globular cluster without any sizable dark matter compo-
nent. The half-light radius of 33 pc, though large for a clus-
ter, is signiﬁcantly smaller than what is typically observed
in dSphs. There are three unusual, seemingly dark matter
dominated objects where similar values of core radii to that
of EC4 have been observed - Willman I, Segue I and Leo V
(Willman et al. 2006; Belokurov et al. 2006, 2008) - though
whether these associations represent dwarfs or clusters is
also subject to debate (see e.g. Siegel et al. 2008). The ob-
jects are also vastly less luminous than EC4 at MV =-2.5,
MV =-3.0 and MV =-4.3. and therefore they are not directly
comparable. Another point to consider is that EC4 has a
very narrow RGB, suggesting that it is composed of a single,
probably old stellar population, without any evidence from
the CMD of radially dependent diﬀerences between inner
and outer parts (Mackey et al. 2006), which would suggest
an extended star formation history. This is in contrast to
dSphs where such trends amongst the population are typ-
ically observed, though there are a few exceptions to this
(e.g. Ursa Major I, Okamoto et al. 2008). Finally, while it is
conceivable that this object is associated with Stream ‘Cp’,
several other ECs with similar sizes and luminosities to EC4
are observed, both in M31, most notably ECs 1, 2 and 3
(Huxor et al. 2005; Mackey et al. 2006; Huxor et al. 2008),
and M33 (Stonkut˙e et al. 2008), that do not appear to be
associated with stellar streams and are therefore not obvi-
ous candidates for dwarfs undergoing tidal disruption. On
consideration of these results, we are led to conclude that
EC4 is most comparable to an extended globular cluster,
possessing no measurable dark matter component.

4.2 The origin of EC4

The location of EC4 in M31’s halo, overlapping with the
tangential streams ‘Cp’ and ‘Cr’, poses some interesting
questions about the origins of the cluster. EC4 lies in
a region where the metal-poor Stream ‘Cp’ has roughly
25% the stellar density of the metal-rich Stream ‘Cr’, al-
though our spectroscopy reveals that EC4 is likely related to
Stream ‘Cp’ with Stream ‘Cr’ overlapping only in projection.
Could Stream ‘Cp’ actually be the debris from disrupted
EC4 material? The integrated luminosity of Stream ‘Cp’ is
comparable to a faint M31 dwarf galaxy like And XV or
And XVI (Letarte et al. 2009), MV ∼ −9.5, which would
suggest the baryonic matter mass loss of EC4 (MV = −6.6
Mackey et al. 2006) would be dramatically larger than its
current intact mass. No distortion of the EC4 isophotes is
found in the HST imaging of Mackey et al. (2006), although
the faintness of EC4 means this is unlikely to be a good test
of ongoing mass loss or tidal distortion. Also, as noted in
section 3, dSphs that have undergone severe tidal disruption
are thought to increase their value of M/L and become more
dark matter dominated. The low value of M/L=6.7+15
−6.7 that
we report here is therefore inconsistent with such an event.
Using the results of Pe˜narrubia et al. (2008), we can esti-
mate what the initial M/L of EC4 might have been if it
had undergone heavy tidal stripping. They ﬁnd that for the
most extreme cases of tidal disruption (mass loss > 99.7%),
the velocity dispersions of dSphs decrease by a factor ∼4,
the core radii are trimmed by a factor ∼3 and the surface
density is decreased by factors up to ∼100. Applying these

10 M. Collins et al.

Figure 7. Comparison of the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and luminosity of EC4 with known dwarf galaxies from both the MW and M31
with central velocity dispersion estimates. The blue hatched region indicates the parameter space that GCs typically occupy. All the
estimates were made with the Richstone & Tremaine (1986) equation presented as equation (1). And XI, And XII, and And XIII (Collins
et al. in prep.) are all shown as upper limits, since their velocity dispersions are all unresolved by their measurements – the 1σ likelihood
contour is used to set a tentative limit. The red lines are curves of constant dark matter halo mass (1, 2, 4, 8× 107 M⊙ from bottom to
top), assuming a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 2.5 M⊙/L⊙. It can be seen that whilst EC4 would need to be ∼100 times more massive
than we have found here in order to consistent with dwarf galaxies of a similar luminosity, it is clearly distinct from the GC population
also.

approximate corrections to our measured EC4 parameters
gives an estimate for the initial M/L of less than 1, further
weakening the case for EC4 being a member of the dSph
population.

Regardless, it is likely that Stream ‘Cp’ and EC4 are
at least related by their kinematics and metallicities. If this
is the case, then EC4 could represent an intact cluster of
an as yet unidentiﬁed disrupting progenitor of Stream ‘Cp’
that has been stripped oﬀ its host and is now being carried
along in its wake. Such a phenomenon has been observed in
the MW, where several GCs have been identiﬁed within the
stream of the currently disrupting Sagittarius dwarf that
are thought to have been stripped from Sagittarius itself
(Dinescu et al. 2000; Mart´ınez-Delgado et al. 2002; Cohen
2004; Carraro et al. 2007). It is also possible that EC4 rep-
resents a cluster from M31’s halo that is now being carried
along within Stream ‘Cp’.

There exists another possibility for the origins of
Stream ‘Cp’ and EC4. It has recently been suggested in
Fardal et al. (2008) that by modeling the progenitor of the
Giant Southern Stream (GSS) in M31 as a disk galaxy rather
than a spherical, non-rotating galaxy as used in other mod-
els (Font et al. 2006; Fardal et al. 2007), many features of
M31’s halo, such as the Northeast and Western Shelves, can
be reproduced. Preliminary results from these models show
that with particular input conﬁgurations for the disk pro-
genitor (speciﬁc combinations of disk mass, radius and orien-
tation), the models can reproduce tangential arc structures,
similar in metallicity and orientation about the minor axis
to those observed by Ibata et al. (2007) and Chapman et al.
(2008). These arcs are the result of stripped debris from the
rotating progenitor being left in diﬀerent physical locations
depending on the disks orientation with respect to M31.

However these simulations do not reproduce the distinct
values of [Fe/H] as seen in Stream ‘Cr’ and Stream ‘Cp’. An-
other point to note is that initial results from modeling place
these simulated stream-like structures much further from the
centre of M31 than the observed streams, suggesting that
their appearance in simulations may be coincidental. Fur-
ther observational constraints and more in depth modeling
is required to determine whether these arcs (and EC4) could
be related to the GSS. If this were the case, then it suggests
that EC4 could have been formed in a larger dwarf galaxy,
and subsequently been stripped oﬀ as the progenitor was
tidally disrupted by M31.

Of course the possibility exists that EC4 is not asso-
ciated with the Stream ‘C’ structure at all, that it merely
overlaps the region in projection. Without precise distance
information, it is diﬃcult to rule this out completely, though
the striking similarities in the kinematics between the two
objects makes such a conclusion seem unlikely.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have conducted a Keck/DEIMOS sur-
vey of the extended cluster, EC4 in the halo of M31. We
have measured the velocities and metallicities for 6 proba-
ble member stars and ﬁnd values of vr=-287.9+1.9
−2.4 kms−1,
σv,corr = 2.7+4.2
−2.7 kms−1, and [Fe/H]=-1.6±0.15 for the clus-
ter. The velocity dispersion of EC4 suggests that no sizable
contribution of dark matter is present within EC4 as it has
a M/L=6.7+15
−6.7, although the results clearly carry large un-
certainties based on only 6 stars. We ﬁnd that EC4 is not
comparable with typical M31 and MW dwarf galaxies, as it
is not consistent with the well established M/L to L relation
for dwarfs. It is more comparable with a GC whose large

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

rh and M/L place it in the extreme tail of the log-normal
size distribution of globulars, without a sizable dark matter
component.

EC4 lies in the region of Stream ‘C’, and its kinematics
and metallicity are very similar to those of the more metal-
poor component, Stream ‘Cp’, suggesting that the two struc-
tures are related to one another. Owing to its current intact
mass and M/L ratio, EC4 is unlikely to be the disrupting
progenitor of the stream, but its strong kinematic resem-
blance suggests it is either a cluster that has been stripped
from the progenitor, or a stellar system that is being carried
along by the disrupted stream.

“Extended Clusters” possess some unusual and interest-
ing properties. Whether they are obscure globular clusters,
tidally stripped dwarfs or a “missing link” between the two,
they represent a relatively unstudied variant of stellar asso-
ciation. The work we have presented here indicates a need
for further spectroscopic surveys of similar objects within
M31 and other local group galaxies to be carried out, to see
if results such as those found for EC4 are present through-
out the EC population. It will be interesting to see if other
ECs have associated streamy substructure, and to discover
what role ECs play in the evolution of galaxies such as our
own MW.
