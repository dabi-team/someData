Abstract

In social choice theory, Sen’s value restriction and Pattanaik’s not-strict value restriction are both
attractive conditions for testing social preference transitivity and/or non-empty social choice set exis-
tence. This article introduces a novel mathematical representation tool, called possibility preference
map (PPM), for weak orderings, and then reformulates the value restriction and the not-strict value
restriction in terms of PPM. The reformulations all appear elegant since they take the form of minmax.
Keywords: social choice theory, value restriction (VR), not-strict value restriction (NSVR), prefer-

ence map

Introduction

Ever since Arrow’s seminal work of Impossibility Theorem (Arrow, 1950, 1951), seeking conditions
for transitive social preference and non-empty social choice set under the majority decision rule has
been a fundamental topic in social choice theory. So far, a number of restrictions have been identiﬁed
(Arrow,1951; Black,1958; Inada,1964,1969; Ward, 1965; Sen, 1966; Sen & Pattanaik, 1969; Pattanaik,
1970; Duggan,2016; and many others). Among those already identiﬁed, Sen’s value restriction (Sen,
1966) and Pattanaik’s not-strict value restriction (Pattanaik, 1970) are attractive since they both cover
some conditions precede them. The objective of this paper is to reformulate these two value-relevant
restrictions in another way.

The individuals preferences are assumed as weak orderings over a ﬁnite alternative set. A novel
mathematical tool, called possibility preference map (PPM), is introduced for representing the weak
orderings. A PPM is a square matrix, whose element indicates the possibility of a certain alternative
being ranked at a certain position. We then reformulate the value restriction (VR) and the not-strict
value restriction (NSVR) in terms of the PPM.

2 Preliminary

2.1 Social transitivity and social choice set

Each individual is assumed to hold a weak ordering as her preference over a ﬁnite set of alternatives.
Following Sen (1966) and Pattanaik (1970), individual i’s preferences over two alternatives x and y such as
”x is at least as good as y”, ”x is preferred to y” and ”x is indiﬀerent to y” are denoted by xRiy, xPiy and
xIiy, respectively. Let R, P and I denote the corresponding social preferences. Let N (xRiy), N (xPiy)

∗Email: houfj@bit.edu.cn.

and N (xIiy) denote the numbers of individuals of those holding xRiy, xPiy and xIiy, respectively. The
majority decision rule means:

⋄ xRy if and only if N (xRy) ≥ N (yRx),

⋄ xP y if and only if N (xRy) > N (yRx),

⋄ xIy if and only if N (xRy) = N (yRx).

If ”(xRy & yRz) → xRz” holds for every triple of alternatives, then the social transitivity is guaranteed
(Sen, 1966). A social choice set of alternative set S is deﬁned by a subset C(S) of S such that every
element in this subset is socially at least as good as every element in S (Sen & Pattanaik,1969).

2.2 Value restriction (VR) and not-strict value restriction (NSVR)

The value restriction (VR) is established over alternative triples (Sen, 1966). Regarding an alternative
in a triple, an individual associates, according to her preference over the triple, a value which can be
”best”, ”worst” or ”medium” with the alternative in consideration. To develop the VR, Sen distinguishes
concerned individuals between unconcerned individuals. If an individual is indiﬀerent between all the
alternatives, then she is called a unconcerned individual. Otherwise, she is a concerned one (Sen, 1966).
Value restriction (VR) A set of individual preferences over a triple is called value restricted when
there exist one alternative and one value such that none of the individuals think that the alternative
takes that value.

Sen (1966) proved a theorem of transitive social preference, that the majority decision rule yields a
transitive social ordering when the preferences of concerned individuals over every triple of alternatives
satisfy the VR and the number of concerned individuals over every triple is odd.

Sen’s value-restricted preference pattern combines the single-peaked preference pattern of Arrow
(1951) and Black (1958), the single-caved preference pattern of Inada (1964), and the two-group-separated
preference pattern of Inada (1964).

The not-strict value restriction (NSVR) is of conditions for non-empty social choice set. It involves
three patterns respectively called not-strict best (NSB), not-strict worst (NSW) and not-strict medium
(NSM). They are deﬁned quite similar to that of VR but with the strict preferences excluded either.
Pattanaik (1970) proved two theorems with one conﬁrming that the choice set is nonempty provided that
the NSB value restriction is fulﬁlled by each of the alternative triples, or that the NSW value restriction
is fulﬁlled by each of the alternative triples; and the other conﬁrming that the choice set of a triple
is nonempty provided that the NSM value restriction is fulﬁlled by the triple. Pattanaik (1970) also
pointed out that NSM value restriction is only suﬃcient for alternative set which includes not more than
3 alternatives. Pattanaik’s NSVR covers the case considered by Dummet and Farquharson (1961).

3 Possibility preference map (PPM)

The preference map (PM) is a mathematical tool for representing weak orderings over a ﬁnite alterna-
tive set. It is established on two assumptions: (a) each alternative corresponds to a set which contains the
alternative’s ranking position or positions; and (b) The alternatives in a tie are tied together occupying
consecutive positions (Hou, 2015a, 2015b).

Suppose that the alternative set is S = {x1, x2, . . . , xm} where 1 < m < +∞. A PM is deﬁned as

follows (Hou, 2015a, 2015b; Hou & Triantaphyllou, 2019).

Preference map (PM) The PM corresponding to individual j’s weak ordering over the alternative

set S = {x1, x2, . . . , xm} is deﬁned by a preference sequence P M (j) = [P M (j)

i

]m×1 such that

P M (j)

i = {|A(j)

i

| + 1, |A(j)

i

| + 2, . . . , |A(j)

i

| + |B(j)

i

|},

(1)

2

where the notation | (cid:5) | stands for the cardinality of a set; A(j)
alternative xi according to individual j’s preference, i.e., A(j)
for the indiﬀerence set of alternative xi, i.e., B(j)

i

i = {xq | xq ∈ S, xqIjxi}.

stands for the predominance set of
stands

i = {xq | xq ∈ S, xqPjxi}; and B(j)

i

For example, the PMs corresponding to the orderings of x1P x2P x3, x1Ix2P x3 and x1Ix2Ix3 are

x1

and





{1, 2, 3}



respectively.

To characterize not-strict preference more intuitively, we deﬁne a novel representation tool for weak

orderings based on the PM.

Possibility preference map (PPM) Let P M = [P Mi]m×1 be a PM corresponding to a weak
ordering. The PPM corresponding to the weak ordering is deﬁned by a m × m matrix [P P Mi,k]m×m such
that

P P Mi,k =

(

1
|P Mi| ,
0,

if k ∈ P Mi,

otherwise.

(2)

One can see from Eq.(2) that the PPM implies a speciﬁc exposition of the assumption for a PM that
the alternatives in a tie will occupy the consecutive positions with equal possibility, and the possibility
level is
|P Mi| . This sort of strategy can be traced back at least as early as Black (1976) when to assign
Borda scores to those alternatives in a tie.

To illustrate the concept of PPM, we reconsider the above three orderings. Their corresponding PPMs

are

Many interesting properties of the PPM might be concluded. For an individual’s PPM with respect to
a triple (x1, x2, x3), however, the following three desirable characteristics are suﬃcient for our discussion.

• if P P Mi,k = 1 then the individual would like to assign a strict value (best, worst or medium,

diﬀerentiated by k) to alternative xi.

• if 0 < P P Mi,k < 1 then the individual would like to assign a not-strict value (best, worst or medium,

diﬀerentiated by k) to alternative xi.

• if P P Mi,k = 0 then the individual does not like to assign position k to alternative xi.

4 Reformulation of value-relevant restriction

4.1 Reformulation of VR

From Section 3, we know that, if the (i, k) element of an individual’s PPM takes the value 0, then
alternative xi will not be ranked at position k. Thanks to this sort of desirable information possibly
conveyed by the PPM, we are able to reformulate the value restriction (VR).

Suppose the individual set is N = {1, 2, . . . , n} with 1 < n < +∞, and the individuals’ PPMs over a

triple (x1, x2, x3) are P P M (j) = [P P M (j)

i,k ]3×3, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.

4.2 Reformulation of NSVR in terms of PPM

Similar to subsection 4.1 but making use of the ﬁrst two desirable characteristics listed in the end of

Section 3, we reformulate the not-strict value restriction (NSVR) as follows.

♦ Not-strict Best (NSB) in terms of PPM A set of n individual preferences over triple (x1, x2, x3)

is not-strict best value restricted if and only if the following condition is satisﬁed

min
i∈{1,2,3}

< 1, k = 1.

(x1, x2, x3) is not-strict medium value restricted if and only if the following condition is satisﬁed

min

< 1, k = 2.

(8)

♦ Not-strict Worst (NSW) in terms of PPM A set of n individual preferences over triple
(x1, x2, x3) is not-strict worst value restricted if and only if the following condition is satisﬁed

min
i∈{1,2,3}

Illustration

For illustrative purpose, we test the reformulated restrictions on an example which was considered by

Sen (1966).

Example 1 Suppose the alternative set is S = {w, x, y, z}, and the individual preference orderings

are

Individual 1 : wI1xP1yP1z,
Individual 2 : xI2wP2zP2y,
Individual 3 : zI3xP3yP3w,
Individual 4 : zP4yI4xP4w,
Individual 5 : zP5yP5xP5w.

As pointed out by Sen (1966), there are 4 possible alternative triples and they are all value restricted, and
thus the majority decision yields a transitive social preference ordering, that is, xIzP yP w. Moreover,
the social choice set is nonempty, and it is {x, z}. In this example the individual set is N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Here we test the preferences’ value-relevant restriction characteristic.

individual preferences in Example 1 yields a non-empty social choice set under the majority rule.

6 Concluding remarks

In this article, a new mathematical tool, called possibility preference map (PPM), was introduced for
representing the weak orderings. Then, we used it to reformulate the value restriction and the not-strict
value restriction in social choice theory. The reformulations appear elegant since they all take the form
of minmax.
