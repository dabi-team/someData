Introduction

We release a set of hand textures for use in virtual reality (VR)
research. The textures cover all six skin-tone levels of the Fitz-
patrick scale [Fitzpatrick, 1988] in addition to three non-human
variants.

Hand representations are an increasingly common way for
users to interact in virtual environments and the hand appear-
ance an important part of the user experience and bodily self-
consciousness when immersed. Our resource allows researchers
to easily setup VR studies with visually realistic hand represen-
tations based on a standard skin tone scale.

Virtual hand representations are increasingly enabled by
consumer-oriented VR technology through built-in hand track-
ing support (e.g., the Oculus Quest1) as well as add-on products
that can add hand tracking support to headsets that do not oth-
erwise support it (e.g., the Leap Motion2). While these systems
usually provide hand models that work with their tracking, tex-
turing of these models is limited. For example, the Oculus and
Leap Motion SDKs both do not include hand textures.

Unfortunately, creating detailed textures for existing hand
models requires the expertise of a texture artist—a role not typi-
cally found in research teams. There are textured hands available
for purchase, but these usually use dierent underlying 3d mod-
els and hence are not directly compatible with the hand tracking
data. While it can be possible to adapt or create a hand skeleton
that matches a model to that data, that in itself is a task that
commonly requires expertise from a 3d artist. For researchers
that want to work with hand representations, but do not have
expertise in 3d modeling, rigging, and texturing, there hence is a
lack of easy to use options.

1.1 Applications for Textured Hands in VR
There are a range of VR research topics where hand textures
are useful. In particular, we see applications for the provided
resource in (1) embodiment research and (2) conducting remote
VR studies.

1.1.1 Embodiment Research

In VR, participants can experience illusory ownership of any
imaginable body, making it an increasingly important research
tool for understanding fundamental questions about the rela-
tionship between the body and the mind [Slater et al., 2009,
Maister et al., 2015].

Embodiment has been referred to participants feeling that,
when given a virtual body, that body’s “properties are processed
as if they were the properties of one’s own biological body” [Kilteni

1https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/
2https://www.ultraleap.com/product/vr-developer-mount/

et al., 2012]. One component of that is body ownership, the
notion that a participant’s “body is the source of the experienced
sensations” [Kilteni et al., 2012]. The relationship between the
virtual body and the sense of body ownership is complex [Maselli
and Slater, 2013].

Avatars, including hands, play an important role in embod-
iment research. For example, more human-looking avatars do
not necessarily lead to more body ownership [Lugrin et al.,
2015]. The sense of body ownership diers not just by visual
realism, but also depending on other properties, such as per-
spective [Maselli and Slater, 2013], or whether the hands are con-
nected [Seinfeld and Müller, 2020]. Furthermore, VR embodi-
ment research lacks standardized measures, tasks, or procedures,
making it even more challenging to converge on theory-building.

The hand textures provided, can therefore aid three common
challenges in VR embodiment research: (1) to match partici-
pants’ real skin-tone to not conict embodiment measures; (2)
to enable research in the important of visual congruence (e.g.,
by mismatching participants’ skin tone and virtual hand tex-
ture); and (3) to create a new standard procedure for employing
humans hands in VR embodiment research.

1.1.2 Remote VR Studies

The infrastructure for remote VR studies is still developing and
an active research area, and with the recent growing adoption
of consumer-level VR devices, remote VR studies have now
become a feasible alternative to lab studies [Mottelson et al., 2021,
Ratclie et al., 2021]. Such crowdsourced VR experiments can
replicate lab studies [Ma et al., 2018] and enable more seamless
recruitment of larger numbers and more diverse participants.
Furthermore, remote studies can happen even at times when
access to laboratories is restricted [Steed et al., 2020].

Before consumer VR devices were commonly available, pre-
vious studies have distributed Google Cardboard kits to partici-
pants [Mottelson and Hornbæk, 2017, Steed et al., 2016]. Simi-
larly, researchers have shown the feasibility of tapping into the
exiting VR software ecosystem, for example, running studies
inside the VRChat application [Sao et al., 2020].

Currently, the most popular VR devices for consumers are the
Oculus Quest 1 and 2. Both come with hand tracking support
and thus allow for running a range of studies that benet from
this level of delity (e.g., studies of grasping, embodiment, or
gesturing). As remote studies commonly have a diverse set of
participants, it is important that the hand representation they
work with reects this diversity. Hence, the skin-tone variants
we make available are an important component required for
running these studies.

1.2 VR Assets as Research Artifacts
With our hand texture resource, we provide a piece of infrastruc-
ture for VR researchers. While VR studies require a substantial
amount of technical expertise to set up, resources like ours can
ease that burden, but also allow for more more comparable re-
sults across studies. In recent years, there has been a growing
number of scientic resources similar to the Hafnia Hands. For
example, Regal et al. [2018] made assets available that make it eas-
ier to integrate questionnaires into VR scenes. With NavWell,
Commins et al. [2020] released a tool for creating and running
navigation experiments. This standardizes the study format, but
also substantially lowers the barriers for running such a study.
Most closely related to our hand texture resource is the Mi-
crosoft Rocketbox avatar library [Gonzalez-Franco et al., 2020],
containing many rigged humanoid 3D models readily available
as self-avatars, or as agents within VR environments.

2 Method
We commissioned the set of nine hand texture variants from
a 3d artist on Fiverr. Fiverr is a platform for connecting with
freelancers, focused on creative tasks such as video editing or
3d modeling. The set (shown in Figure 1) includes six dier-
ent human skin-tones, as well as three non-human hands: a
robot hand, an alien hand, and a skeleton hand. Each variant
comes with albedo, ambient occlusion, metallic, smoothness/
roughness, and normal maps and hence is compatible with com-
monly used physically-based shading models (such as the Unity
Standard Shader).

The textures are designed to work directly with the default
hand used by the Oculus Quest hand tracking. Currently, this
is the most widely used variant of hands for VR and also the
one most suited for remote studies due to the large user base of
consumers. However, note that the textures can, in principle,
be used with other hand models. Assuming the topology is
similar (as should be the case for models of human hands) this
would only require some changes to the UV coordinates of those
models. Additionally, we provide hand textures compatible with
the 3D hand models developed for the Oculus controllers; that
way researchers can utilize our hand resource for studies using
both free hand interaction and controller-based interaction.

We conducted an online and unsupervised study to evalu-
ate the suitability of the hands for remote evaluations, and to
get quantitative insights of their eects on embodiment. We
evaluate the eects of skin-tone matching as well as owning the
non-human hand variants. The study, its hypotheses, method,
procedure, and analyses approach was pre-registered3.

We used a within-subjects design with hand texture as the only
independent variable. Hand texture had three levels: skin-tone
matched, skin-tone mismatched, and non-human. Participants
completed three repetitions of a hand movement task with each
hand texture, balanced using a latin square, for a total of nine
trials per participant.

variants, an alien, a robot, and a skeleton hand. The skin-tone
variants are designed to look realistic, while the non-human
hands are more stylized.

gender) and young, with an estimated mean age of 28.9 (SD
9.6). The median reported skin tone was 3. Most participants
reported medium skin tones, with 86% in the 2–4 range on the
Fitzpatrick scale (6× 1, 36× 2, 36× 3, 24× 4, 7× 5, and 3× 6 on
the Fitzpatrick scale). Participants conducted the study from
32 dierent countries, most commonly the USA (18), Poland
(13), Germany (12), the UK (12), and Italy (8). The participants
were also experienced VR users, with the majority (51) having
more than 100 hours of VR experience.

2.2 Task
We employed a novel study task where participants followed
targets with their hands. The task required participants to act
with their hands, while also forcing them to focus on their hands.
Each trial took 60 seconds and was split in two equally long
phases: one for each hand, ordered randomly.

During the task, participants had to keep their hand inside
a framed box that appeared in front of them. After appear-
ing, the box moved along a randomly generated path within a
40 × 60 × 40 cm volume. We generated the path so each seg-
ment was at least 20 cm long. Box movement slowed down at
path nodes and accelerated in between, moving at an average
overall speed of 0.6 m per second. During each segment the box
also performed a random rotation to between −40°and 90°(left
hand) −90°and 40°(right hand) roll. The boxes changed color
to indicate whether participants’ hand were contained within,
prompting participants to follow study procedures. When par-
ticipants moved outside the boxes, we displayed a textual alert in
the background asking them to return their hand inside.

2.1 Participants
We recruited 112 participants from an internal email list of pre-
vious participants. Participants were predominantly male (103
male, 6 female, and 3 participants who did not want disclose

2.3 Procedure
We rst prompted participants for informed consent and col-
lected demographic information, using a virtual questionnaire.
We then asked participants about their skin tone, which then
formed the selection for the skin-tone matched condition. For

2

the skin-tone mismatched condition, we picked a hand texture
three levels away from the participant’s (i.e., 1 → 4, 3 → 6,
5 → 2, ...). We always used the alien hand texture for the
non-human condition. Participants then completed nine trials
(three with each hand) in random order. Overall, the study took
about 10 minutes. A rst warm-up round was used to determine
tracking quality. If mean condence for tracking was below
60%, the participant would retry until quality was satisfactory,
as per [Mottelson et al., 2021].

2.4 Measures

For each trial we measured four dependent subjective variables us-
ing questionnaires displayed in VR: To measure Resemblance
we used the Features question from [Banakou and Slater, 2014].
To measure Agency we used the Agency question from [Ba-
nakou and Slater, 2014]. To measure Body Ownership we used
the MyBody question from [Banakou and Slater, 2014]. To mea-
sure Humanness we used a scale from [Ho and MacDorman,
2017], composed of ve questions.

3 Validation

From the participants responses we seek to validate the suitabil-
ity of Hafnia hands for VR research. In particular, when used
for embodiment and remote studies, Hafnia hands need to (1)
resemble participants’ own hands and hence also elicit a higher
sense of body ownership. See Figure 2 for an overview of how
participants’ rated their experience with the hands.

We test the eects of hand representation on body ownership,
agency, and resemblance using Friedman tests for main eects.
For the humanness scale, we use a repeated-measure ANOVA.
We use Wilcoxon rank sum tests with Bonferroni correction for
post-hoc comparisons.

We nd an eect of hand representation on body ownership;
2 (2) = 109.77, p < 0.001. All pairwise comparisons were
χ
signicant (p < 0.001). For agency, there was a signicant main
2 (2) = 26.27, p < 0.001. Yet, only the alien hand and
eect χ
matched hand were signicantly dierent (p = 0.04). We also
2 (2) =
found an eect of hand representation on resemblance; χ
150.31, p < 0.001. All pairwise comparisons were also signicant
(p < 0.001). Finally, we also found a signicant eect of hand
representation on humanness; F (2, 222) = 189.6, p < 0.001.
Post-hoc tests found signicant dierences between the alien
hand and the two realistic hands (p < 0.001).

In summary, the hands provided as part of Hafnia hands
showed increased body ownership using a skin-tone matched
texture; increased resemblance with a skin-tone matched texture;
and decreased humanness with a alien texture. All registered
hypotheses were hence found to be true.

These results also validate the suitability of Hafnia hands
as a resource in embodiment and remote VR studies. Particu-
larly with respect to body ownership, skin-tone matched hands
provide a benet. Furthermore, we validated that the provided
non-human alien hand elicits the opposite response: low body
ownership, visual resemblance, and humanness. Hence, the set
of provided hand textures covers a wide spectrum of subjective
responses, which is required in a range of study designs.

4 Limitations
The sample for the evaluation was predominantly young and
male, which has previously been shown to cause bias in VR
research [Peck et al., 2020]. The hand textures visually resemble
relatively young human hands, making the sample’s age t the
study; however, future studies could entail textures matched
and evaluated for seniors. The hand textures were, however,
designed as gender neutral, whereas the evaluation consisted
of predominantly males. This is a limitation of the evaluation,
caused the bias of HMD owners’ demographics.

As a manually-created resource, Hafnia hands are limited in
the range of visual characteristics they cover. In addition to lack
of gender and age specicity, the hands also do not account for
several other properties, such as: dirtiness, ngernail length/
style/color, skin conditions, or ner nuances in skin-tone. A
potential solution for this are parametric hand texture mod-
els [Qian et al., 2020]. However, to make use of the wide range
of such models, a parameter acquisition step for each participant
is required. The quality of current model outputs also is not
consistently at the same level as artist-created textures and does
not include non-human textures at all.

While hands are perhaps the most important limb in embodi-
ment research (e.g., the rubber hand illusion), future research
resources and studies could consider creating resources enabling
full body VR embodiment studies.
