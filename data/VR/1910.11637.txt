ABSTRACT
Drawing tools for Virtual Reality (VR) enable users to model 3D
designs from within the virtual environment itself. These tools
employ sketching and sculpting techniques known from desktop-
based interfaces and apply them to hand-based controller interac-
tion. While these techniques allow for mid-air sketching of basic
shapes, it remains difficult for users to create detailed and compre-
hensive 3D models. In our work, we focus on supporting the user
in designing the virtual environment around them by enhancing
sketch-based interfaces with a supporting system for interactive
model retrieval. Through sketching, an immersed user can query a
database containing detailed 3D models and replace them into the
virtual environment. To understand supportive sketching within
a virtual environment, we compare different methods of sketch
interaction, i.e., 3D mid-air sketching, 2D sketching on a virtual
tablet, 2D sketching on a fixed virtual whiteboard, and 2D sketch-
ing on a real tablet. Our results show that 3D mid-air sketching is
considered to be a more intuitive method to search a collection of
models while the addition of physical devices creates confusion due
to the complications of their inclusion within a virtual environment.
While we pose our work as a retrieval problem for 3D models of
chairs, our results can be extrapolated to other sketching tasks for
virtual environments.

1 INTRODUCTION
Sketching in Virtual Reality (VR) allows users to design and create
objects in 3D virtual space. To aid users in the creation of complex
3D designs, existing methods are often supported by a retrieval
algorithm capable of finding complex designs based on a simple
sketch made by the user by searching a model database. Common
approaches can be divided into methods focusing on gestural inter-
action [14, 42] or techniques allowing to freely draw sketches in
either 2D [19] or 3D space [20]. Gestural interaction techniques are
widely used to execute an action as a trigger mechanism or depict a
simple trajectory in the design space. While gestures are generally
easy to use, they are usually not suitable for characterizing detailed
features of an object. A dictionary of gestures additionally limit the
ability of the user to freely express their desires. This is especially
so for the task of retrieval where flexibility is key to finding the
relevant content. However, both 2D and 3D sketches allow the user
to convey complex structures including their details. These tech-
niques extend the scope of potential designs to a large number of
objects within a collection with significant variations in terms of
both shape, color and texture.

While 2D drawing is familiar, the extension to 2D sketching of
3D objects is non-trivial where perspective and in turn the users
depictive ability plays an important factor. However, understanding
whether mouse or pen interaction, the familiar, translate into an
immersive environment is important to evaluate the contribution
of 3D approaches for retrieval and VR interaction in general.

Despite the growing interest in methods for Sketch-based Re-
trieval [9, 10, 21, 29, 30], only few examples apply to VR [20, 25].
The reason for this is twofold: (1) the ability for sketch descriptions
of an object to adequately express the model, and (2) ability for
users to get confidence with the depiction of structural elements.
Prior work by Giunchi et al. [20] utilized a Multi-View CNN to
solve for the first, and introduced on-model sketching in VR for the
second. In the same study, Giunchi et al.also performed a detailed
study of descriptors for use in 3D model retrieval.

While Giunchi et al. [20] showed how a combination of sketch
and model improves the user’s retrieval query, they only explore
a single modality of interaction, i.e., 3D mid-air sketching, and
its level of effectiveness. However, it is essential to understand
how different interaction methodologies can impact on both user

2.1 2D Sketching for Retrieval
Sketch-based Retrieval techniques using 2D sketches query rely on
a predefined database to obtain either a resulting image (SBIR) or
video (SBVR). SBIR approaches can be classified into blob-based
techniques that try to extract features for shape, color or texture for
the blob, or contour-based techniques that characterize the image
with curves and lines. Blob-based SBIR methods try to describe im-
ages using descriptions of the segments within the image, for exam-
ple, QBIC [4], which creates separate descriptors for the modalities.
Alternatively, topology models [35] can describe the blob charac-
teristics. Contour-based methods include elastic matching [5] and
grid and interest points approaches [11]. SBVR approaches mainly
address the optimization of objects between video and sketch query.
Collomosse et al. [13] applied Linear dynamic system to solve the
object matching. Hu et al. [22] introduced a hybrid technique that
takes advantage of object semantics. While, James et al. [23] pro-
posed a descriptor-based technique for fast indexable retrieval. To
improve on early methods for sketch-based retrieval, more recent
literature started to employ neural networks. An early example
was SketchANet [45], which performed sketch recognition using
Alexnet [24]. More recently, triplet convolutional neural networks
have gained interest as they have the capacity to deal with deep
embedding spaces [9]. Improving the image similarity metric is a
main challenge as these triplet architectures are used to measure
similarities between images and sketches [10]. Examples include
the work of Wang et al. [41], where they developed a learning model
based on triplets to describe the images considering fine-grained
similarities. This approach was extensively used in recent works
like in Wang et al.[40] where the embedding spaces of sketches and
3d models were joint, and in Li et al. [26] for images and 3D models.
All the aforementioned approaches focus on ’Drawing on a white-
board’ with generally singular or interactive search. While improve-
ments in the field of model retrieval increase accuracy, supporting
the user during sketching is imperative to increase performance.
One example is ShadowDraw [34], where the user is provided with
feedback related to texture, color, and shapes to improve image
retrieval task. During a sketching activity, the system provides the
user with a real-time shadow image to help free-form drawing and
achieve a better final sketch of the object. iCanDraw [16] helps
to solve drawing issues by exploiting algorithms for sketch recog-
nition. Lastly, Sketch-to-Collage [31] uses a query-by-sketch to
generate collages from an image collection and deploys an indexing
mechanism based on colors and shapes.

With the rapid growth of 3D model collections the retrieval
of a 3D model from a collection has received attention. However,
the nature of the sketch is abstract and iconic, and it does not
easily lend itself to describing an object in its details from a 2D
query. However for image retrieval two classes of descriptors were
introduced: model-based descriptors and view based descriptors.
For model-based there consists three types of descriptors: geometric
moment [8], surface distribution [28] and volumetric descriptors
[32]. The common goal for all of them is to extract the features
that describe the shape of the objects. View-based extracts features
from a collection of the 2D projections of the 3D models. Ansary et
al. [1] implement an indexing method that exploits 2D views and
Su [36] implemented a stack of convolutional neural network that

performance and user experience. In addition it is crucial to separate
the model component from the sketch component because the first
one tends to have supremacy over the second one when combined.
Therefore, we present a study to understand how users interact
with physical and virtual devices framed in a retrieval context.
Our work investigates different techniques for users to provide
initial sketch designs as input for sketch-based retrieval algorithms
in virtual environments. Therefore our contribution are as follows:

• Four methods of Sketch-based Retrieval interaction in VR:
– 3D Mid-Air Sketching, based on the method of Giunchi et

al. [20] using mid-air drawing using a controller;

– 2D Sketching on a VR Tablet, using a 2D tablet within the

virtual environment;

– 2D Sketching on a VR Whiteboard, using a VR plane to

annotate the model;

– 2D Sketching on a physical tablet, using a real world tablet

tracked in VR to annotate the model with strokes.
• An extensive user study over the four methods identifying

the advantages of methods with regards to the user.

In the remainder of this paper we outline related work (sec. 2), and
detail theon four interaction methods in sec. 3. We provide the
details of our user study (sec. 4), evaluate our results (sec. 5), and
summarize our contributions (sec 6).

2 RELATED WORK
Using Sketches for interaction has a long history, e.g., in the context
of the retrieval of images [15, 18, 21] or videos [22, 23], interaction in
2D [19], or more recently for interaction in 3D [20]. Given the multi-
modal interaction style there is a vast amount of literature that can
be considered relevant. We therefore focus on core techniques in
2D sketching (sec. 2.1) and 3D sketching in AR/VR (sec. 2.2).

takes multiple 2D projections of the 3D model generating a single
compact descriptor for the object.

2.2 3D Sketching in AR/VR
Rather than transforming 2D sketches into 3D representations, im-
mersive modeling environments allow users to sketch and design
3D content using mid-air interaction techniques. Such techniques
utilizing 3D space are intuitive to learn regardless of the user’s
expertise with the VR system [42]. A very early example of such
an approach called HoloSketch [14] combined head-tracked stereo-
scopic shutter glasses and a CRT monitor with a six-axis mouse or
wand for mid-air freehand drawing.

While 3D freehand drawing can support expert 3D artists [33]
and shows improving accuracy and uniformity of sketched objects
over time [43], interaction techniques for sketching in 3D are still
limited in terms of accuracy and user fatigue. Realizing an intended
stroke during sketching is firstly bound by the user’s perception of
depth [3]. When users are unable to determine their active drawing
location and spatial relationships with other contents inside the
scene, sketching errors occur. Additionally, the added complexity
of 3D compared to 2D sketching causes a higher cognitive load
and increasingly taxes the sensorimotor system [43]. Lastly, as the
absence of a physical resting surface leads to fatigue, accuracy is
negatively influenced accuracy over time [3].

3D freehand sketching approaches can be further classified in
categories that highlight the motivation as well as the limitation of
such type of interaction: metaphors and both virtual and physical
support surfaces.

For Sketch metaphor Wacker et al.[38] designed and implemented
a tool called ARPen, whose real-world position is tracked by a smart-
phone app, that lets the user interact via mid-air sketch. In addition,
they evaluated through a user study different techniques to select
and move virtual objects with such a tool. 3D sketching is used in
the work of Giunchi et al.[20] where the task is retrieving a target
model from a large collection of chairs combining sketch input with
3D models by using a multi-view CNN to improve accuracy during
the search. A user study where a searching task is proposed to the
participants compared the search based on sketch interaction with
simple browsing of the chair database. We develop our study consid-
ering the 3D sketch method based on the same freehand interaction
but focusing specifically on the aspect of sketch generation.

In recent years in VR environments, the use of 2D surfaces,Virtual
surfaces, has been explored to replace the inaccuracy brought by
3D tracking. Despite the lack of one dimension some tasks are
suited for a 2D device such as terrain editing [6], user interface
editing [7] or even object selection and manipulation [37]. Arora et
al.developed SymbiosisSketch AR [2] that combines 3D drawing
in mid-air with freehand drawing on a surface. They equipped the
user with an Hololens, a tracked stylus, and a tablet and created
a hybrid sketching system suitable for professional designers and
amateurs. Machuca et al.supported 3D immersive sketching using
multiple 2D planes to create 3D VR drawings [27].

A virtually rendered tablet in VR can not provide the same
latency-free response that a 2D tool or Physical surfaces can have,
different attempts of integrating a real physical 2D tablet have been
made. Arora compared traditional sketching on a physical surface

to sketching in VR, with and without a physical surface to rest
the stylus on [3]. Additionally, they investigated visual guidance
techniques to devise a set of design guidelines. Wacker et al.[39]
studied how accurately visual lines and concave/convex surfaces
let users draw 3D shapes attached to physical virtual objects in AR
and Dorta [17] draws on virtual planes using a tracked tablets.

3 SKETCH MODALITIES FOR VR
In the following section, we describe our implemented model re-
trieval system, our four sketch interaction methods and our back-
end which acts as retrieval system. For each method, the user is
immersed within a virtual environment and sketches either in 3D
mid-air (3D Sketching), on a virtual tablet, a virtual whiteboard or
on a tracked physical tablet.

3.1 Interaction Methodologies
We propose four distinct methods of interaction, 3 of them use 2D
sketch generated on different canvas and with different actions,
and only one of them make use of 3D sketch. We outline them in
detail below.

3D Mid-Air Sketching. This method, shown in Figure 2a, is
similar to existing systems for sketching in VR and is directly based
on the method for 3D mid-air sketching described in [20]. The user
directly sketches in 3D space using a hand-held controller. While
holding down the trigger button, a virtual stroke is applied in the
air at the current position. By dragging the controller through the
air, strokes are extended towards a continuous line. Once the trigger
button is released, the active stroke is considered to be completed,
and a new stroke can be initiated. There is no theoretical limit to the
volume the sketch can occupy and the user can create the sketch
in any position.

2D Sketching on a VR Tablet. With this method, we mimic a

natural method of sketching, but placed within VR.

A 2D panel is attached to the user’s non-dominant hand con-
troller, see Figure 2b, referencing the familiar painting palette. We
avoided a user movable panel due to the additional complexity
of modelling an unconstrainted position and orientation. As this
method aims to simulate sketching on a portable tablet, we de-
signed the 2D panel with a similar size to a commonly used tablet
device (Galaxy Tab A 10.1") with the largest dimension as side of
the squared panel. The actual sketching of lines is done using the
controller in the user’s dominant hand. This makes the interaction
technique a bi-handed approach as both hands are involved in the
process of sketch creation, i.e., one hand performs the sketch while
the other hand stabilizes the drawing canvas. Here, the 2D sketch
is not only limited in the third dimension, but also by the size of
the panel.

2D Sketching on a VR Whiteboard. Similar to VR Tablet, the
whiteboard method provides a panel onto which the user can sketch
in 2D, see Figure 2c. A familiar design paradigm, the whiteboard
technique extends the size of the tablet to that of a larger whiteboard
in order to provide more space for sketching.

The dimension of the whiteboard is linearly five times than the
virtual tablet, with the same pixel resolution. As the whiteboard is
positioned on a fixed location (centre of the room) inside the virtual

environment, this method does only requires the use of the user’s
dominant hand. The user could ask, before starting the session to
adjust the position of the whiteboard.

2D Sketching on a Physical Tablet. Using a real-world tablet
(Galaxy Tab A 10.1") approach offers the user a physical tablet to
perform 2D sketching while immersed in the virtual environment,
see Figure 2d. This mimics the most commonly technique used by
digital artists.

The tablet is positioned on a table and requires a short regis-
tration procedure before the start of a sketching session. While
the tablet is still limited in drawing space, the physical feedback
provided from the actual device aims to improve the stability dur-
ing sketching. The user is able to sketch using her finger, thus this
approach does not require the use of a controller. The user’s hands
are tracked using a LEAP motion device as the virtual environment
needs to visualize the correct position of the hands of the user. This
additional tracking is necessary as we noticed during a first imple-
mentation that the absence of the visual feedback for the finger
position led to an unpleasant experience. This was mainly due to
the user being unable to find the right location of contact between
her finger and the tablet.

3.2 Sketch and 3D collection
The 3D sketch is implemented as a colored strip with a wider section
that is exposed to the current camera. Consequently, all the virtual
cameras involved in the multi-view generation render the sketch-
oriented along the wider section independently from the length or
the trajectory of the stroke. The user can change the color of the
next sketch using the palette without modifying the strokes already
generated. The 2D sketches are simply implemented as sequences
of connected points on a canvas.

As chairs database we used a set of 3370 chairs that are part of
ShapeNet [44]. ShapeNet is a large collection of 3D models where
an extensive subset is made by chairs with or without colors or
textures.

3.3 Model Retrieval
To perform sketch retrieval, we implemented a back-end which
hosts a pre-loaded CNN model. This back-end answers the visual
queries containing the sketches by producing a list of the 40 models
that are considered more similar to the input sketch. We used the
VGG-M Matlab implementation of Su [36]. This implementation
provides a single visual descriptor after elaborating the snapshots
taken by VR software. The method works by generating a set of
structured camera views (snapshots) around the models. These
images are then passed through the CNN and a final descriptor is
generated. During the generation of the snapshots, the cameras
in the virtual environment move at different angles looking at the
center mass of the sketch and fit in the image its maximum extent.
The CNN uses the VGG-M model [12] which has 5 convolutional
layers and 3 fully connected ones. The encodings from each view are
then merged through view-pooling using a max function over the
views, using the final 3 fully connected layers of VGG-M to create
a descriptor. We removed the final layer of the model described
by Su et al., as it is normally used for classification purposes. In
contrast, for the other methods of interaction we bypass the pooling
step. An overview of the entire system is depicted in Figure 3.

4 EXPERIMENT
To compare our four interaction methods for sketching in VR, we
designed and conducted a user study performed in our lab.

Participants: We used a within-subjects experimental design to
help to reduce the number of participants and errors associated
with individual differences. To counterbalance possible carryover
effects, the methods were randomized between the users. As our
independent variable, we distinguish the methods used to sketch,
3D sketch, 2D sketch on a virtual tablet, 2D sketch on a fixed vir-
tual whiteboard and 2D sketch on a real tablet. We distinguish 3
dependent variables, namely the success rate, the completion time
of the task and the number of submitted queries during the search.
A total of 5 participants (4 male, 1 female, 25 − 43 age range with
avg. 34) volunteered for our study that was approved by ANON
ethics board. All participants had previous experiences with VR
and already used an Oculus RIFT and Touch.We opted for a within-
subjects study with a high number of searching tasks to minimize
the possible fluctuations in drawing skills emerging from a study
with many users on few chairs. A total of 32 searches were per-
formed by each user, 8 for each of the 4 methods. In total we have
160 searching sessions. The users did not declare to have particular
abilities in drawing or sketching, and they were compensated for
the test.

Apparatus: The rendering of the Virtual Environment was per-
formed in Unity 2018.2.13 using an Oculus RIFT DK1 headset with
a connected laptop computer. The specification of the laptop is:
Intel i7 CPU, 64 GB RAM with Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M graphics
card. The interaction with the 3D environment was provided by
both the Oculus Touch, i.e., two controllers paired with the headset,
and hand-tracking using a LEAP Motion device. For the real tablet
session, we use a Galaxy A6 tablet, tracked within Unity application
via an Oculus Touch controller attached on the top right corner

with Oculus Rockband VR Touch Guitar Mount Attachment.

Procedure: Before starting the experiment, each participant signed
a consent form and was instructed on the searching task. A period
of 15 minutes was dedicated to training the user to develop confi-
dence with the controllers, the sketch mechanism and the virtual
environment. Between each method, users had 3 minutes of rest
and they can perform the task seated or standing up.

Upon completion of the introduction, the experiment commenced.
Inside the virtual environment, users are placed inside a virtually
furnished room with a chair model in the center. The user searches
by sketching and then triggering the search system when he or
she wants. Results are displayed on a floating panel. The panel is
positioned on the left controller, and the selection is made via the
right-hand controller. The panel can display 10 chairs at a time,
and 40 chairs are the result of each query. Therefore the user can
navigate 4 pages with simple controls. We decided to display only
ten models per page in order reduce occlusion of the scene while
providing enough variety for the user to choose from.

For each method, participants were asked to perform sketch
searches for a given set of 8 different chairs in shape and textures.
For each session, the participant started with a randomly selected
sketch interaction method and performed the search for each tar-
get chair of the 8 proposed in a random order. Using the selected
method, the participant started sketching to initiate the search for
the presented target chair. Upon confirmation, the system provided
the user with a set of potential chairs considered to be most similar
to the created sketch. The participant could refine the search re-
sults by editing or detailing the sketch. When the participant was
satisfied with the results, one of the chairs from the proposed set
was selected. This selection concluded the search task and would
replace the presented 3D model inside the scene. Each session is
given a time limit of 3 minutes after which the search was consid-
ered terminated without a successful result. Additional functions
available to the participants during sketching with all the different
methods were: undo function to erase the sketch either entirely
or partially, and a color palette to characterize the sketch with a
chosen color.

The experimenter recorded success rate and completion time for
each task. The user’s experience with the current sketching method
was measured asking the user to rate the interaction on a scale
from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good).

5 EVALUATION
We investigated the differences between the four different methods
of interaction using sketches within a virtual environment. We
evaluated our study over the 8 distinct chairs presented to each
participant and 4 methods to test in terms of the accuracy of the
returned model, time, and the number of queries to complete the
task. To evaluate the accuracy we counted the number of success-
ful searches among the total number of searches. The number of
successful task completions for the 3D sketch was 37 out of 40
(92.5%), the 2D sketch with the whiteboard was 9 out of 40 (22.5%),
the 2D sketch with virtual tablet was 6 out of 40 (15%) and the the
2D sketch with real tablet was 5 out of 40 (12.5%). To evaluate the
efficiency we measured the time elapsed from the beginning to the
end of the search and count for each search the number of attempts
to submit the sketch to the system. The average time among all the
chairs for the the 3D sketch was 71 seconds, the 2D sketch with the
whiteboard was 156 seconds, the 2D sketch with virtual tablet was
169 seconds and the the 2D sketch with real tablet was 166 seconds.
The average number of attempts among all the chairs for the the 3D
sketch was 1.85, the 2D sketch with the whiteboard was 4.88, the
2D sketch with virtual tablet was 5.65 and the the 2D sketch with
real tablet was 2.9. We demonstrated how the variation in chairs
effects the different methods in the radar plot of Figure 4.

We showed in Figure 7 the cumulative number of attempts over
the different methods of interaction. It can be seen that the 2D
virtual tablet required a significant numbers of search triggers,
while the 3D sketch required the least. In Figure 5, we show how
the difference in 3D model effects the number of required search
triggers. These results mimic those of fig. 7, but also demonstrate
how different chairs provide challenges to the different interaction
methods. Interestingly, for 3D Sketching and Physical tablet the
figure has a similar profile across models as opposed to VR Tablet
and Virtual Whiteboard.

Finally, at the conclusion of the experiment the user evaluated
the different methods of interaction shown in Figure 6 is the cumu-
lative score. 3D sketch appears to provide the best user experience.
However, the trend is inconsistent with the number of triggers of
figs 7 and 5.

The difficulty in finding some 3D models with 2D techniques in the
database becomes evident from Figure 4. Despite all the methods

being intuitive, the 3D sketch is more accurate and satisfying to
the user experience.

In the case of 3D Sketch the user can depict the target chair
using more naturally the depth information, while in all the other
methods user can draw only a 2D projection of a three dimensional
data on a texture. Intuitively the search results will be improved
in terms of precision since more sketch features can be extracted
and evaluated by the system. The real tablet method introduces
physical feedback for the user as the draws are generated by the
finger when touching the surface, but essentially the output of
the interaction is the same for all the 2D techniques. As each user
performs 32 searches in total, they develop a plan to optimize the
search, exploring how the input impacts on the neural network and
exploiting eventual winning strategies for each method.

As 3D sketch interaction generates 12 input images from different
points of view, the 2D sketch can contribute only with one. With 2D
sketch, each user quickly developed the idea of selecting the most
significant view angle and tries to depict that projection. Despite
this, as the success rate for 2D methods is lower than 3D Sketching.
Some users tried to draw the different points of view in the same
texture, in some cases achieving successfully the target chair. Also,
while the 3D sketch does not require an accurate depiction, we
noticed that for each 2D methods the user tended to detail the
drawing to increase the probability of finding the target.

Figure 6: Each bar is the cumulative score given by each user
for a specific method.

As a consequence, a typical behavior noticed on the 2D canvas
is that the user preferred to fill accurately areas between the edges.
This disposition is not necessary for 3D where a few quick strokes
can be interpreted by the system as a filled surface. The motivation
for this differences is again the lack of information of 2D sketch
compared with the 3D counterpart, so the need to detail the 2D
drawing as much as possible emerges naturally.

problematic interaction lead the user to give up quickly, avoiding
an extensive search as in the other 2D methods.

All the aforementioned considerations impact on the user expe-

rience as shown in Figure 6.

5.2 Limitations
Despite 3D sketch showing positive feedback from the user study
compared to the other methods, we investigate some aspects and
limitations of this system to improve the search accuracy or experi-
ence. Below we outline the most important ones:
Query Descriptors In our study, we used VGG-M deep descriptor,
but recently a large number of CNN architectures has been designed
guided by the work of Giunchi et al.. We implemented our system
as distinct modules that can be replaced easily, threrefore being
relatively simple to extend the study to different neural networks
and machine learning models in order to make a comprehensive
survey. These solutions could also be fine-tuned to VR or learnt
through active learning to become bespoke to the users style. We
however focus on the user expeirence with the different modalities
in this study.
Expanded comparisons Although our study aimed to compare 4
comprehensive methods for retrieval using sketches in the style of
both 3D or 2D, the study could extend the study to other methods of
interaction. An additional method could be a tracked pen coupled
with the tablet to increase accuracy. An interesting follow-up would
be comparing the user experience and accuracy obtained in a virtual
environment with a real counterpart. In such case the interaction
with the physical tablet would likely create a more pleasing user
experience.
Sketch in Augmented Reality Understanding how users sketch
within a virtual reality allows us to perform controlled user stud-
ies, but many application fields require real-world interaction. By
trivial adaptations to this method, we could see applications within
Film & TV for set design or architecture for model creation. Such
applications require their nuances to be consider and would need
to take advantage of the aforementioned extensions.

In addition, we aim to compare the sketch mechanism with more
advanced user interfaces paired with state-of-the-art mechanisms
for searching objects in immersive environments such as text input
and faceted search. Moreover, we want to explore possible ways to
integrate sketch with additional information coming from a more
complex interface. Furthermore, several benefits can be achieved
providing functionalities such as brush size, erase and transform
operations that could mimic the basic functionalities of 2D photo
editing software.

6 CONCLUSION
In the task of scene modeling we have investigated different strate-
gies of interaction within Virtual Reality. Framed within the context
of database navigation and retrieval for scene modeling, sketch in-
teraction has been shown to be a satisfying method when compared
with text queries or even the simple database scrolling allowing
expressive visual description of the query and accurate results to
be retrieved. In addition, 3D and 2D sketch are extensively studied
in different contexts related to database navigation and we have

Figure 7: Each bar is the cumulative number of search trigger
events given by each user for a specific method.

This lack of efficiency for the 2D sketches harm the user experi-
ence. Essentially the 2D drawing is conditioned by a continuous
search of the feature that can trigger the right system’s response.
Therefore, this attitude denatures the process of intuitive and icono-
graphic representation of a model.

In terms of user interaction, for the aforementioned reasons 2D
sketch modalities required from the user more query submission to
the system (as shown by Figure 7), more attention, a firmer hand,
and in particular with virtual tablet two hands working at the same
time. This could have caused discomfort after a few minutes of
sketching and eventually a loss of accuracy.

Between 2D methods, the whiteboard shows better results than
the virtual tablet for two main reasons: firstly because of the fixed
texture to draw on, and secondly because of the larger canvas that
can include more details. Despite the distance between the surface
and the drawing hand is the largest between the 2D methods, this
result shows that this aspect does not have a negative impact on
the task.

The real tablet is interesting because of the physical interaction
that is completely absent in all the other methods. While at the
beginning of the session this is a pleasant novelty, contrary to what
was imagined the sketch done directly with the finger was less
precise if compared to the sketch generated by a remote controller.
Moreover, mixing virtual reality with a tracked canvas was not
sufficient to guarantee decent user experience. The absence of the
positional information of the finger lets the user, still immersed
in the scene, become disoriented during the drawing process as
it is unclear where is the finger respect to the canvas position.
Despite that we managed this issue using a Leap Motion to track
continuously the finger displaying an avatar, sometimes noise was
introduced and the user experience deteriorated rapidly. In addition,
as it inherited the lack of performance of the 2D techniques, this
method does not improve the results of the other 2D methods. This
could indicate that even synthetic haptic feedback could aid in the
drawing for the other methods even in 3D Sketching.

Both Figure 7 and Figure 5 combined with the success rate of the
methods motivate the low value of triggering events for 3D sketch
and real tablet techniques. 3D sketch had a high rate of success and
a low number of queries that indicates the high efficiency of the
method. On the contrary, even if the real tablet had few triggering
events it does not mean that is efficient. Its low success rate and

filled a needed missing comparative study performed within VR.
Our study fills this gap by comparing different sketch-based mech-
anisms including 3D, 2D sketch in virtual reality with a tablet or a
whiteboard and a method that considers the use of a physical tablet
while the participant is immersed in the virtual environment. In
our experiment, we collected the time to perform the task, the rate
of success, and the number of queries.

We analyzed the methods and discovered that amongst the 2D
methods, the provision a physical tablet did not improve the user ex-
perience. It is intuitive to conclude 3D sketching as a more suitable
user experience within VR, therefore overcoming the familiarity
of 2D based retrieval. We therefore pose 3D mid-air sketching as a
suitable direction within VR retrieval and related tasks.
