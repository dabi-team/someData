Abstract—Immersive video, such as virtual reality (VR) and
multi-view videos, is growing in popularity. Its wireless streaming
is an instance of general multicast, extending conventional unicast
and multicast, whose effective design is still open. This paper
investigates the optimization of general rate splitting with linear
beamforming for general multicast. Speciﬁcally, we consider a
multi-carrier single-cell wireless network where a multi-antenna
base station (BS) communicates to multiple single-antenna users
via general multicast. Linear beamforming is adopted at the BS,
and joint decoding is adopted at each user. We consider the
maximization of the weighted sum rate, which is a challenging
nonconvex problem. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm for
the problem to obtain a KKT point using the concave-convex
procedure (CCCP). The proposed optimization framework gen-
eralizes the existing ones for rate splitting for various types of
services. Finally, we numerically show substantial gains of the
proposed solutions over existing schemes and reveal the design
insights of general rate splitting for general multicast.

Index Terms—General multicast, general rate splitting, linear
beamforming, joint decoding, optimization, concave-convex pro-
cedure (CCCP).

I. INTRODUCTION

Conventional mobile Internet services include (traditional)
video, audio, web browsing, social networking, software
downloading, etc. These services can be supported by unicast,
single-group multicast, and multi-group multicast. Immersive
video, such as 360 video and multi-view video is growing
in popularity. When watching a tiled 360 video, the tiles in
a user’s current ﬁeld-of-view (FoV) plus a safe margin are
usually transmitted to the user in case of an FoV change. On
the other hand, when watching a multi-view video, a user’s
current view and adjacent views are usually transmitted to
the user in case of a view switch. When streaming a popular
immersive video to multiple users simultaneously, multiple
messages (e.g., tiles for 360 video and views for multi-view
video) are transmitted to each user, and one message may be
intended for multiple users [1], [2], as illustrated in Fig. 1. This
emerging service plays an important role in online gaming,
self-driving, and cloud meeting, etc. but cannot perfectly adapt
to the conventional transmission schemes mentioned above.
This motivates us to consider general multicast (also referred
to as general connection [3] and general groupcast [4]) where
one message can be intended for any user. Clearly, general
multicast includes the three conventional transmission schemes
as special cases.

References [1], [2] are pioneer works for supporting wire-
less streaming of a 360 video [1] and wireless streaming of a
multi-view video [2], which are instances of general multicast.

is adopted to convert general multicast to per resource block
single-group multicast. While the OMA-based mechanisms are
easy to implement, spatial multiplexing gain is not exploited.
On the other hand, non-orthogonal transmission mechanisms
achieve higher transmission efﬁciency but are also more chal-
lenging due to interference. Space Division Multiple Access
(SDMA) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) are
two solutions. The cost to suppress interference in SDMA can
be high when the channels for some users are spatially aligned,
while decoding interference in NOMA may not be possible
when the interfering message rate is too high. Thus, SDMA
and NOMA may also have unsatisfactory performance. Rate
splitting, originally proposed to effectively support unicast
services [5], can partially suppress interference and partially
decode interference and hence may circumvent the limitations
mentioned above.

In [5], [6], the authors investigate the simplest form of
rate splitting for unicast, hereafter called 1-layer rate splitting,
for the two-user interference channel [5] and two-user multi-
antenna broadcast channel [6], respectively. In [8], the authors
investigate the precoder optimization of 1-layer rate splitting
for unicast for Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output chan-
nels. Later, 1-layer rate splitting for unicast is extended to
general rate splitting for unicast [9], 1-layer rate splitting for
unicast together with a multicast message intended for all users
[10], and multi-group multicast [11], respectively. Speciﬁcally,
[9]–[11] focus on the optimizations of rate splitting with lin-
ear beamforming. Optimization-based random linear network
coding design for general multicast has been studied in [3]
for wired networks. Besides general rate splitting for general
multicast has been studied in [4] for discrete memoryless
broadcast channels. Here, we are interested in Gaussian fading
channels and speciﬁcally the linear beamforming design from
the optimization perspective. Besides,
the optimization of
rate splitting with linear beamforming for unicast and its
slight generalizations in [10], [11] cannot apply to general

 
 
 
 
 
 
multicast. Therefore, for general multicast, the optimization
of general rate splitting with linear beamforming remains an
open problem.

This paper intends to shed some light on the above issue.
Speciﬁcally, we consider a multi-carrier single-cell wireless
network, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communi-
cates to multiple single-antenna users via general multicast.
First, we present general rate splitting for general multicast
and characterize the achievable rate regions under linear beam-
forming at the BS and joint decoding at each user. Then, we
optimize the transmission beamforming vectors and rates of
sub-message units to maximize the weighted sum rate subject
to the achievable rate region constraints and power constraint.
Note that the proposed problem formulation includes those
in [9]–[12] as special cases. This problem is a challenging
nonconvex problem. Next, we propose an iterative algorithm
to obtain a KKT point using the concave-convex procedure
(CCCP). Finally, we numerically demonstrate substantial gains
of the proposed solutions over existing schemes and reveal the
design insights of general rate splitting for general multicast.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce general multicast in a
single-cell wireless network and brieﬂy illustrate its con-
nection with unicast, single-group multicast, and multi-group
multicast. Then, we present general rate splitting. Finally, we
illustrate the physical layer model and the implementation with
linear beamforming and joint decoding.

A. General Multicast

We consider a single-cell wireless network consisting of
one BS and K users. Let K , {1, . . . , K} denote the set of
user indices. The BS has I independent messages. Let I ,
{1, . . . , I} denote the set of I messages. We consider general
multicast. Speciﬁcally, each user k ∈ K can request arbitrary
Ik messages in I, denoted by Ik ⊆ I, from the BS. We do not
have any assumptions on Ik, k ∈ K except that each message
in I is requested by at least one user, i.e., ∪k∈KIk = I [3].
To facilitate serving the K users, we partition the message
set I according to the requests from the K users. For all
S ⊆ K, S 6= ∅, let

PS ,

Ik

I −



denote the set of the messages that is requested by each user
in S and not requested by any user in K\S [1]. Deﬁne





[k∈K\S

P , {PS|PS 6= ∅, S ⊆ K, S 6= ∅},
S , {S|PS 6= ∅, S ⊆ K, S 6= ∅}.

Thus, P forms a partition of I and S speciﬁes the user groups
corresponding to the partition. We refer to each element in P
as a message unit.1 We can see that different message units in
P are requested by different user groups in S.

1P and S are assumed to be given in [4].

Fig. 2. Wireless streaming of a tiled 360 video to three users. The
360 video is divided into 4 × 4 tiles. The users have different FoVs
which overlap to certain extent. K = 3, I = 8, I1 = {1, 2, 5, 6},
I2 = {2, 3, 6, 7}, I3 = {5, 6, 9, 10}.

Example 1 (Illustration of P and S): As illustrated in Fig. 2,
we consider K = 3, I = 8, I1 = {1, 2, 5, 6}, I2 = {2, 3, 6, 7},
I3 = {5, 6, 9, 10}. Then, we have P{1} = {1}, P{2} = {3, 7},
P{3} = {9, 10}, P{1,2} = {2}, P{1,3} = {5}, P{1,2,3} = {6},
P = {P{1}, P{2}, P{3}, P{1,2}, P{1,3}, P{1,2,3}}, and S =
{{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}. There are 6 message
units that are requested by 6 groups of users, respectively.
For example, message unit P{1} is requested only by user 1,
message unit P{1,2} is requested by user 1 and user 2, and
message unit P{1,2,3} is requested by user 1, user 2, and user
3.

Remark 1 (Connection with Unicast and Multicast): The
considered general multicast includes conventional unicast,
single-group multicast, and multi-group multicast as special
cases. When I = K, Ik = 1, k ∈ K, and Ik 6= Ik′ , k, k′ ∈
K, k 6= k′, general multicast reduces to unicast. In this case,
P = {{1}, {2}, . . . , {K}} and S = {{1}, {2}, . . . , {K}}.
When I = 1, implying Ik = 1, k ∈ K, and Ik = Ik′ , k, k′ ∈
K, k 6= k′, general multicast becomes single-group multicast.
In this case, P = {{1}} and S = {K}. When 1 < I < K
and Ik = 1, k ∈ K, general multicast reduces to multi-group
(I-group) multicast. In this case, P = {{1}, {2}, . . . , {I}}
and S = {{k ∈ K|Ik = {1}}, . . . , {k ∈ K|Ik = {I}}}. The
general multicast considered in this paper, general connection
in [3], and general groupcast considered in [4] mean the same.

B. General Rate Splitting

We consider rate splitting in the most general form for
general multicast to serve the K users [4]. It allows each user
group to decode not only the desired message unit PS but also
part of the message unit of any other user group, PS ′ for all
S′ 6= S, S′ ∈ S, to ﬂexibly reduce the interference level. For
all S ∈ S, let GS , {X |S ⊆ X ⊆ K}. Namely, GS collects
all 2K−|S| subsets of K that contain S. Deﬁne G ,
S∈S GS.
Obviously, S ⊆ G. First, we split each message unit PS into

Remark 2 (Connection with Rate Splitting for Unicast and
Multicast): When general multicast degrades to unicast, the
proposed general rate splitting reduces to the general rate
splitting for unicast proposed in our previous work [9], which
extends the one-layer rate splitting for unicast [5]. When
general multicast degrades to single-group multicast, the pro-
posed general rate splitting reduces to the conventional single-
group multicast transmission as GS = G = {K}, S ∈ S.
When general multicast degrades to multi-group multicast, the
proposed general rate splitting reduces to the one-layer rate
splitting for multi-group multicast [11].

C. Physical Layer Model and Implementation

The BS is equipped with M antennas, and each user has
one antenna. We consider a multi-carrier system. Let N and
N , {1, 2, . . . , N } denote the number of subcarriers and the
set of subcarrier indices, respectively. The bandwidth of each
subcarrier is B (in Hz). We consider a discrete-time system,
i.e., time is divided into ﬁxed-length slots. We adopt the block
fading model, i.e., for each user and subcarrier, the channel
remains constant within each slot and is independent and iden-
tically distributed (i.i.d.) over slots. We consider slow fading
and study an arbitrary slot. Let h , (hk,n)k∈K,n∈N ∈ CM×1
denote the system channel state. Assume that user k ∈ K

knows his channel state hk , (hk,n)n∈N and the system
channel state h is known to the BS.
For all G ∈ G, transmission unit

PG is encoded (channel
coding) into codewords that span over the N subcarriers. Let
sG,n ∈ C denote a symbol for
PG that is transmitted on the n-
th subcarrier. For all n ∈ N , let sn , (sG,n)G∈G, and assume
n ] = I. We consider linear beamforming. For all
that E[snsH
e
n ∈ N , let wG,n ∈ CM×1 denote the beamforming vector
PG on subcarrier n. Using superposition
for transmitting
coding, the transmitted signal on subcarrier n, denoted by
xn ∈ CM×1, is given by:

Here, P denotes the transmission power budget. Deﬁne G(k) ,

where the last equality is due to (5), and zk,n ∼ CN (0, σ2)
is the additive white gaussian noise (AWGN). In (7), the ﬁrst
term represents the desired signal, and the second represents
the interference. It is noteworthy that the main idea of rate
splitting is to make the undesired messages partially decodable
in order to reduce interference [9]. To exploit the full potential
of the general rate splitting for general multicast, we consider
joint decoding at each user.3 That is, each user k ∈ K jointly
PG, G ∈ G(k). Thus, the

III. OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM FORMULATION

In this section, we would like to optimize the transmission
beamforming vectors w , (wG,n)G∈G,n∈N and rates of
the sub-message units R , (RS,G)S∈S,G∈G to maximize

2When S = K, GS = {S} and the message unit PS will not be split. For

ease of exposition, we let PS = PS,S and RS = RS,S for S = K.

3We can easily extend it to successive decoding as in [9].

 
the weighted sum rate,4
S∈S αSRS, where the coefﬁcient
αS ≥ 0 denotes the weight for message unit PS, subject to the
total transmission power constraint in (6) and the achievable
rate constraints in (8). Therefore, we formulate the following
optimization problem.

(6), (8).

Remark 3 (Connection with Rate Splitting for Unicast and
Multicast): When general multicast degrades to unicast, Prob-
lem 1 reduces to the weighted sum rate maximization problem
for general rate splitting for unicast in [9]. When general mul-
ticast degrades to single-group multicast, Problem 1 reduces
to the rate maximization problem for single-group multicast in
[12]. Finally, when general multicast degrades to multi-group
multicast, Problem 1 can be viewed as a generalization of the
weighted sum rate maximization for multi-group multicast in
[11].

Note that the objective function is linear, the constraint in
(6) is convex, and the constraints in (8) are nonconvex. Thus,
Problem 1 is nonconvex.5

IV. SOLUTION

In this section, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain
a KKT point of Problem 1 using CCCP. First, we transform
Problem 1 into the following equivalent problem by intro-
ducing auxiliary variables e , (ek,n,X )X ⊆G(k),k∈K,n∈N and
u , (uk,n,X )X ⊆G(k),k∈K,n∈N and extra constraints:

Let (w⋆, R⋆, e⋆, u⋆) denote an optimal solution of Problem 2.

4The proposed problem formulation and solution method can be readily

extended to maximize the sum rate and worst-case rate as in [9].

5There are generally no effective methods for solving a nonconvex problem
optimally. The goal of solving a nonconvex problem is usually to design an
iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point or a KKT point (which satisﬁes
necessary conditions for optimality if strong duality holds).

Let (w‡, R‡, e‡(h), u‡) denote an optimal solution. It is obvi-
ous that (w‡, R‡) is an optimal solution of Problem 1. Next,
we transform the above problem to Problem 2 by relaxing the
constrains in (12) to the constraints in (11). By contradiction
and the monotonicity of the objective function with respect to
(w.r.t.) R in Problem 2, we can show that the constraints in
(11) are active at the optimal solution. Thus, (w‡, R‡, e‡, u‡)
is an optimal solution of Problem 2. Therefore, we can show
(cid:4)
Theorem 1.
Based on Theorem 1, solving Problem 1 is equivalent to
solving Problem 2. Problem 2 is a difference of convex func-
tions (DC) programming (one type of nonconvex problems)
and a KKT point can be obtained by CCCP [9].6 The main
idea of CCCP is to solve a sequence of successively reﬁned
approximate convex problems, each of which is obtained by
linearizing the concave part and preserving the remaining
convex part
the i-th
iteration, the approximate convex problem of Problem 2 is
given as follows. Let (w(i), R(i), e(i), u(i)) denote an optimal
solution of the following problem.

details of CCCP for obtaining a KKT point of Problem 2 are
summarized in Algorithm 1.7 As the number of iterations of
Algorithm 1 does not scale with the problem size [14], the
computational complexity for Algorithm 1 is the same as that
for solving Problem 3, i.e., O(K 3.521.75×2K

) as K → ∞.

Algorithm 1 implements CCCP. It has been validated in [13]
that solving DC programming through CCCP always returns

a KKT point. Therefore, we can show Theorem 2.
This paper focuses mainly on exploiting the full potential of
general rate splitting for general multicast. The computational
complexity of Algorithm 1 can be formidable with a large K.
We can use successive decoding to reduce the computational
complexity to O(K 1.5|S|1.522K) as in [9].8 We can also
apply rate splitting with a reduced number of layers together
with successive decoding to further reduce the computational

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we numerically evaluate the proposed solu-
tion obtained by Algorithm 1, namely Prop-RS. We consider

7In practice, we can run Algorithm 1 multiple times with different feasible
initial points to obtain multiple KKT points and choose the KKT point with
the best objective value.

8Note that |S| may not scale with K and how |S| scales with K relies
on the user requests. In the case of |S| = O(1), the reduced computational
complexity is O(K 1.522K ), as K → ∞.

9In the case of |S| = O(1) and |Glb| = O(1), the reduced computational

complexity is O(N 3.5K 3.5) as K → ∞.

three baseline schemes, namely 1L-RS, NoRS, and OFDMA.
1L-RS and NoRS extend 1-layer rate splitting [8] and SDMA
[15], both for unicast, to general multicast. More speciﬁcally,
1L-RS and NoRS implement Algorithm 1 to obtain KKT
points of Problem 1 with GS = {S, K}, S ∈ S and with
GS = {S}, S ∈ S, respectively. OFDMA considers the
maximum ratio transmission (MRT) on each subcarrier and
optimizes the subcarrier and power allocation [1].

In the simulation, we set K = 3, I = 7, I1 = {1, 4, 5, 7},
I2 = {2, 4, 6, 7}, and I3 = {3, 5, 6, 7}, as illustrated in
Fig. 3. As a result, we have P{1} = {1}, P{2} = {2},
P{3} = {3}, P{1,2} = {4}, P{1,3} = {5}, P{2,3} = {6},
and P{1,2,3} = {7}. Additionally, we set αS = 1/7, S ∈ S,
B = 30 kHz, N = 72, and σ2 = 10−9 W. We consider
spatially correlated channel with the correlation following the
one-ring scattering model as in [9]. When applying the one-
ring scattering model, let G denote the number of user groups.
We set the same angular spreads for the G groups and the same
azimuth angle for the users in each group as in [9]. Note that G
is related to the channel correlation among users. Speciﬁcally,
the correlation increases as G decreases. When G = 1,
all users belong to one group and have the same channel
covariance matrix. When G = 3, all users are in different
groups and have different channel covariance matrices. We

generate 100 realizations of random system channel state,
solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem for each
realization, and evaluate the average of the weighted sum rate
of each scheme over the 100 random realizations.

Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6 illustrate the average of the
weighted sum rate versus the number of transmit antennas
M , the total transmission power budget P , and the number of
user groups G, respectively. From the three ﬁgures, we have
the following observations. Firstly, the weighted sum average
rate of each scheme increases with M , P , and G. Secondly,
Prop-RS outperforms the baseline schemes. The gain of Prop-
RS over 1L-RS is because the proposed solution unleashes
the full potential of the ﬂexibility of rate splitting. The gain
of Prop-RS over NoRS arises because the cost for NoRS to
suppress interference is high. In contrast, rate splitting together
with joint decoding partially decodes interference and partially
treats interference as noise. The gain of Prop-RS over OFDMA
comes from an effective nonorthogonal transmission design.
Additionally, Fig. 6 shows that the gains of Prop-RS over
1L-RS and NoRS increase as G decreases, demonstrating the
advantage of ﬂexibly dealing with interference in the presence
of channel correlation among users. Fig. 7 shows the rates
of the transmission units in the proposed solution versus
the number of user groups G. We can see that
R{2},
and
R{3} increase with G, whereas
R{2,3},
e
and
R{1,2,3} decrease with G. This is because as channel
e
correlation among the users decreases, it is efﬁcient to decode
less interference and treat more interference as noise.

VI. CONCLUSION

While applications such as content delivery are responsible
for a large and increasing fraction of Internet trafﬁc, general
multicast communication will play a central role for future 6G
and beyond networks. This paper investigated the optimization
of general rate splitting for general multicast. We adopted

linear beamforming at the BS and joint decoding at each user.
We maximized the weighted sum rate under the achievable
rate region constraints and power constraint. We proposed
an iterative algorithm to obtain a KKT point. The proposed
optimization framework generalizes the existing ones for rate
splitting for unicast, single-group multicast, and multi-group
multicast. Numerical results demonstrate notable gains of the
proposed solution over existing schemes and reveal the impact
of channel correlation among users on the performance of gen-
eral rate splitting for general multicast. There are still some key
aspects that we leave for future investigations. One direction
is to go beyond linear approaches and investigate nonlinear
precoders such as binning. Another interesting perspective is
general multicast with partial channel state information at the
transmitter side.
