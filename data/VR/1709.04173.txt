Abstract For the ﬁrst time, based on long-term spectral monitoring with high spec-
tral resolution, the optical spectrum of the weak central star of the IR source
RAFGL 5081 has been studied. The spectral type of this star is close to G5÷8 II,
and its eﬀective temperature is Teﬀ≈5400 K. An unusual spectral phenomenon was
discovered: splitting of the proﬁles of broad, stationary absorption lines of medium
and low intensity. The heliocentric radial velocities Vr of all components of metal
absorption lines, the Na I D lines, and the Hα line were measured for all the obser-
vation epochs. The constancy of the absorption lines rules out the possibility that
the line splitting is due to binarity. The radial velocities of the wind components
in the proﬁles of the Na I D and Hα lines reach −250 and −600 km/s, respectively.
These proﬁles have narrow components, whose number, depth, and position vary
with time. The time variability and multicomponent structure of the proﬁles of the
Na I D and Hα lines indicates inhomogeneity and instability of the circumstellar en-
velope of RAFGL 5081. The presence of components with velocity Vr(IS) =65 km/s
in the Na I (1) lines provides evidence that RAFGL 5081 is located behind the Perseus
arm, i.e, no closer than 2 kpc. It is noted that RAFGL 5081 is associated with the
reﬂection nebula GN 02.44.7.
Keywords: stars, evolution, AGB stars, circumstellar envelopes, optical spectroscopy.

1. Introduction

As its name implies, the infrared (IR) source RAFGL 5081 (=IRAS 02441+6922) was
detected in the earliest balloon IR surveys. Later, Kwok et al. [1] included it in a list
of candidate asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Evolved AGB stars and stars in the
post–AGB stage, observed during the short evolutionary transition to a planetary nebula
(protoplanetary nebulae, PPN), have low-mass cores with masses of about 0.6 M⊙. The
degenerate cores are surrounded by extended gas–dust envelopes that formed due to the
substantial loss of stellar matter in earlier evolutionary stages. The presence of circum-
stellar gas and dust is manifest by the characteristic infrared, radio, and optical spectra
of PPN.

The optical spectra of these low-mass supergiants diﬀer from the spectra of classical
massive supergiants in the presence of molecular bands superimposed on the spectrum
of a cool supergiant, anomalies in the proﬁles of the H I, Na I, and He I absorption and
emission lines, and the presence of emission lines of some metals (for details and references,
see [2]). In addition, all these spectral features often vary with time. Overall, we observe the
following features in the optical spectra of post-AGB supergiants, which distinguish them
from the spectra of massive supergiants: complex proﬁles of H I containing absorption
and emission components that vary with time, absorption or emission molecular bands,
mainly of carbon-containing molecules, envelope components of Na I and K I resonance
lines, narrow forbidden or permitted emissions of metals formed in the envelope.

To date, there is no information about the central star of RAFGL 5081. Hrivnak et al. [3]
did not ﬁnd an optical counterpart of RAFGL 5081 in their study on the identiﬁcation
of OH/IR objects. There are neither spectral nor photometric observational data for
this object in the visual in the SIMBAD database. There are also very few publications
about observations of RAFGL 5081 in the other wavelength ranges. Using the results of
IR observations on the Canada–France–Hawaii telescope and IRAS data, Kwok et al. [1]
classiﬁed RAFGL 5081 as a member of a the group of sources with their maximum IR
radiation at λ < 10 µ, but could not say anything deﬁnite about the nature of the object.
No radiation is detected in CO, OH, or H2O [4, 5]. Note that the absence of molecular
and maser radiation is not rare for AGB stars (see, for instance, [6]).

In our current study, we have aimed to determine the main parameters of this object
and its evolutionary status based on optical spectroscopy. We emphasize that, since no
observations of the object in the optical range are available, our spectral observations are
the ﬁrst for RAFGL 5081. Section 2 briey describes the observational data, and Section 3
presents information about the proﬁles of features detected in high-resolution spectra.
We discuss the results and attempt to apply them to determine luminosity, distance, and
evolutionary status of the star. The results are further discussed in Section 4, and the
main conclusions are summarized in Section 5.

2. Observational data and reduction

A program of spectroscopic studies of AGB and post-AGB supergiants with IR excesses,
including some related stars with unclear evolutionary status, has been carried out on the
6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) over the past two decades.
The initial aim of the program was to dene the fundamental parameters of the studied
objects and to search for anomalies in the chemical compositions of their atmospheres
associated with the synthesis of elements in the preceding evolutionary stages. The set of
information obtained makes it possible to reliably establish the evolutionary status of the
star. During the realization of the program, the need arose for additional research aimed
at identifying peculiarities in the spectra and variability of spectral features with time. A
detailed study of the velocity ﬁeld in the atmospheres and envelopes of the program stars
was also necessary.

In the present study, we used spectra obtained at the Nasmyth focus using the NES
spectrograph [7], which, in combination with a 2048×2048 CCD array and image scanner,
provides a spectral resolution of R≈60 000. Since 2011, the NES spectrograph has been

Klochkova et al.: Gusty wind in the system of the infrared source RAFGL 5081

equipped with a large-format (2048×4096) CCD array, providing a signiﬁcant increase in
the simultaneously detected wavelength range. The details of the spectrophotometric and
position measurements of the spectra are described in earlier papers, which are referenced
in [2].

Table 1 presents information on the spectral data. To track the stability of these data
over the 14–year interval, we present heliocentric radial velocities Vr of several interstellar
lines and bands: three components of the Na I doublet and the narrowest DIBs at 5797,
6197, 6379, and 6614 ˚A (values obtained from the ﬁrst band only are followed by colons).
The two last rows of this table present the mean values of Vr and their uncertainties.
The close values of Vr in the last two columns conrm the interstellar origin of the longest
wavelength component of the Na I doublet. The spectrophotometric and position mea-
surements were carried out using 24 spectra obtained on arbitrary dates in 2001–2015.
The data for nearby dates were averaged, and data are accordingly represented in Table 1
by 20 epochs, and in Table 2 by 21 epochs.

3. Main features of the optical spectrum

The optical spectrum of the counterpart of RAFGL 5081 in the detected wavelength range
(3950–8480 ˚A is an absorption spectrum. Most of the lines belong to ions and neutral
atoms of iron-group elements; weak emission is present only in the long-wavelength wing
of the Hα line (see Fig. 1). Figure 2 compares a small fragment of the spectrum with a
corresponding spectral fragment for the cool supergiant HD 246299, identiﬁed with the
IR source IRAS 05381+1012. The spectrum of HD 246299 was obtained using the same
NES spectrograph and processed using the same procedures. Its spectral type was deter-
mined to be G2 I [8]. This comparison of the spectra of the two stars shows that their
spectral types are similar. The spectra also display similar line widths. Thus, in a ﬁrst
approximation, we can assume that the spectral type of the star is approxG5–8 II. This
estimate of the spectral type is consistent with the estimated eﬀective temperature of
the star, Teﬀ =5400±100 K, which we determined using the set of criteria of Kovtyukh
et al. [9]. A late spectral type for the optical counterpart of RAFGL 5081 is consistent
with the absence of signatures of molecular and maser radiation from the stellar envelope.
This indicates that the star has not yet begun its evolution away from the AGB. We note
here the study of Lewis [10], who examined the chronology of the appearance of various
masers in post–AGB stars.

A high luminosity for the star is indicated by the blue-shifted wind components of
the Na I (1), Hα, and Hβ lines, whose proﬁles are presented in Fig. 3, and by an absence
of broad wings in the photospheric Hβ and Hγ lines. A well-known criterion for stellar
luminosity is the equivalent width of the O I 7773 ˚A triplet, whose calibration was obtained,
e.g., in [11]. The equivalent width of this triplet in the spectrum of the counterpart
of RAFGL 5081 is W(OI) = 0.84 ˚A, implying the luminosity Mbol =−4m. This estimate
is not an accurate determination of the stellar luminosity, however, as the measured
value of W(OI) should be considered a lower limit, since the individual components of
the triplet overlap due to their large widths. In addition, the equivalent width of the
triplet can be aﬀected by the oxygen in the stellar atmosphere, whose abundance we
do not know apriori. The moderate luminosity enables us to reject a massive evolved

4

star (supergiant or hypergiant); a low-mass supergiant in the AGB stage is a more likely
candidate for RAFGL 5081. The large widths of the metallic absorption lines conﬁrms
also a high luminosity for the star. However, since the luminosity estimate based on the
equivalent width of the W(OI) triplet is not extremely high, the width of the metallic
absorption lines is more likely related to macroturbulence and/or the axial rotation of the
star.

The wind components of the Na I D and Hα proﬁles extend to short wavelengths, to
velocities of −250 and −600 km/s, respectively, as is clearly show in Figs. 1 and 3. Narrow
components are clearly visible in these proﬁles, whose number, depth, and positions vary
with time. The limits of the time variation of the Na I line can also be judged from
Fig. 4. The radial velocities for the cores of the components are presented in the third
column of Table 2. In one of the spectra obtained on October 28, 2015, which included
red wavelengths, the parameters of two interstellar components of the K I 7696 ˚A were
measured. The locations and relative depths of both component are shown in Fig. 4.
It is obvious that the expanding envelope of RAFGL 5081 is inhomogeneous, since up
to four clumps are present in the line of sight simultaneously. This inhomogeneity and
the asymmetry of the envelope are also manifest through appreciable instability of the
positions of the wind components of the Na I D and Hα line proﬁles. These features of
the Na I D and Hα line proﬁles suggests that the wind is non-stationary.

The proﬁles of photospheric metallic absorptions are also unusual. Nearly all of these
are split, and, unlike the wind absorption lines, are stationary. The lines in the spectrum of
RAFGL 5081 are broad and strongly blended, but the splitting of weak absorptions makes
their components distinguishable (e.g., the blue components of Ti I 6126 and Fe I 6128 ˚A in
Fig. 2). Other examples are shown in Fig. 5, which presents the proﬁles of several lines of
varying strength, from the weak Fe I 6042 ˚A line to the TiII+FeII 4549 ˚A line. This clearly
shows that blue and red components approach each other as the lines become deeper,
until the proﬁle becomes that of a single line.

The variation of the absorption proﬁles with their depth, shown through the dependence
of the radial velocity on the residual intensity, is illustrated in Fig. 6. The data here were
averaged over the spectra obtained on April 18, 2014 and October 28, 2015. Corresponding
Vr(r) dependences were constructed for each spectrum and used to estimate the radial
velocities for both absorption components (on average, at about −54 and +10 km/s).
These are presented in the second column of Table 2 on either side of the parantheses
containing the central velocity values, which were derived from the bisector of the proﬁle
as a whole. Figure 6 and Table 2 show that the central velocities do not change with either
line depth or with time.

The constance of the split lines excludes the possibility that the splitting is due to
binarity. This is all the more so as the binary components would have to be stars with
close values of their absorption intensities. It is also not possible to obtain the observed
proﬁle shape by superposing absorption and emission lines: on average, the depths of
the lines in the spectrum of RAFGL 5081 are the same as those of HD 246299, and their
equivalent widths are even larger.

Estimation of the velocity of the center of mass of the star (Vsys) is related to estimation
of its distance. As we noted in the Introduction, neither molecular nor maser radiation
from RAFGL 5081 are detected. This makes it natural to suppose that Vsys is close to the

average velocity of weak absorption features, Vsys≈ −21 km/s. Velocity estimates based
on the photospheric components of the Hβ, Hγ, and Hδ proﬁles and the Hα emission
component also support this hypothesis (see Fig. 1). It would also be useful to take into
account C2 and CN molecular absorption, which can form in the outer envelopes of cool
stars, but we could not identify such features in our spectra. It may be that these molecular
absorption lines will be found in spectra with higher resolution and higher signal-to-noise
ratio.

Let consider the narrow absorption features in the Na I (1) doublet in more detail. It
seems that only the two components of Na I (1) with velocities of −8.5 and −65.3 km/s,
whose positions coincide with the the position of the components of the K I 7696 ˚A line,
have an interstellar origin. Within the uncertainties, the average velocity estimated from
diﬀuse interstellar bands, Vr(DIBs) =−9.3 km/s, agrees with the position of the interstellar
Na I (1) component with Vr(IS) =−8.5 km/s, which forms in the local Galactic arm. Taking

into account the data of [12] for the Galactic structure, the presence of components with
the velocity −65.3 km/s in the Na I (1) proﬁles suggests that the star, which has Galactic
coordinates l/b≈ 133◦/9◦, is located behind the Perseus arm and is therefore no closer
than 2 kpc.

Adopting for RAFGL 5081 the above estimate Vsys≈ −21 km/s, the velocity of the
star appears peculiar. It cannot be ruled out that the third component with the average
velocity Vr =−44.4 km/s forms in the circumstellar medium. In this case, we can estimate
the expansion velocity of the envelope as Vexp≈ 23 km/s. Comparing this value of Vexp
with the data for the sample of post-AGB stars studied in [2] shows that this derived
velocity is typical for stars in the AGB and post–AGB stages.

4. Discussion of the results

The limited nature of the observational data available for RAFGL 5081 hinders reliable
determination of its fundamental parameters, accurate calculation of its chemical com-
position, and thus determination of its evolutionary status. One natural way to at least
partially solve these problems is to consider searches for similar objects among stars stud-
ied earlier. The long-term program of spectroscopy of anomalous supergiants with large
IR excesses carried out on the SAO 6-m telescope resulted in an extensive collection

Klochkova et al.: Gusty wind in the system of the infrared source RAFGL 5081

7

of high-quality spectra of objects of this type. We were able to draw some conclusions
concerning evolutionary changes in their fundamental parameters, their detailed chemical
compositions, and peculiarities of the kinematic states of their atmospheres and structured
extended circumstellar envelopes.

In particular, the analysis of the extensive collection of high-quality echelle spectra of
post–AGB stars enabled the detection of previously unknown features in the spectra of
selected post-AGB stars with atmospheres enriched in carbon and heavy s-process metals
and circumstellar envelopes containing carbon molecules: splitting (or asymmetric) strong
absorption lines [2, 13]. Using published IR and radio spectroscopic data, it was shown
that the individual components of the split absorptions are formed in the structured
circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars [2]. In this way, observational evidence for
enrichment of the circumstellar envelopes in heavy s-process metals was obtained. The
splitting into components of the proﬁles of the strongest heavy-metal absorption features
found in the spectra of the post–AGB supergiants V5112 Sgr [14], V354 Lac [15], and
CGCS 6918 [16], which have extended envelopes with complex morphologies, suggests
that the formation of a powerful structured envelope in the AGB stage is accompanied
by an outow of stellar nucleosynthesis products into the interstellar medium. Attempts to
ﬁnd a direct relationship between features of the optical spectrum and the morphology
of the circumstellar medium are complicated by the fact that the observed structure of
the envelope depends strongly on the inclination of the symmetry axis to the line of sight
and the angular resolution of both the spectral and imaging instrumentation.

Earlier, in our program of spectroscopy of supergiants with IR excesses, we studied the
F star V2324 Cyg, which displays some spectral features that place it outside the sample
of canonical post–AGB stars. The most important of these is the presence of strong and
variable Hα emission [17] in the spectrum of V2324 Cyg, which contains a wind compo-
nent with a velocity of up to 450 km/s. Other lines of neutral hydrogen and the Na I D
lines also have complex P Cygni-type proﬁles indicating high wind velocities. Moreover,
the proﬁles of metal absorption lines in the spectrum of V2324 Cyg are broadened by the
high microturbulence and rotational velocities: ξt = 6 km/s and Vrot = 69 km/s, respec-
tively [17].

V2324 Cyg is probably a massive star in the post-AGB stage, with an initial mass of
Minit ≥4 M⊙, judging from the very large excesses of Li and Na in its atmosphere. Excess
abundances of light metals and lithium can be the result of eﬀective hot bottom burning in
the course of the evolution of the most massive AGB stars (see, e.g., [18]). It is important
that fairly strong Li I 6707 ˚A absorption has also been reliably identiﬁed in spectra of the
optical counterpart of RAFGL 5081, with an equivalent width averaged over ﬁve spectra
of Wλ = 106 m˚A. The presence of this line indicates that RAFGL 5081 is among the more
massive AGB stars, in good agreement with its association with OH/IR sources [1]. Using
our estimate of Teﬀ, a surface gravity typical for cool supergiants, log g = 1.0, and the
microturbulence velocity ξt = 6 km/s, we obtained for Wλ = 106 m˚A the fairly high lithium
abundance log ǫ(LiI) ≈ 2.6, which should be considered a preliminary estimate only.

The optical component of the OH/IR star IRAS 18123+0511 was studied for the
ﬁrst time using spectra obtained with the SAO 6-m telescope [19]. Like in the case of
RAFGL 5081, IRAS 18123+0511 was not identiﬁed with any known optical object, and
no photometric measurements are available. According to [19], the abundance of iron-

8

Klochkova et al.: Gusty wind in the system of the infrared source RAFGL 5081

group elements (V, Cr, Fe) in the atmosphere of the central star of IRAS 18123+0511 is
one-third the solar value. The calculated abundance ratio O/C>1 is consistent with the
existence of silicate emission at a wavelength of about 9.7 µ in the IR spectrum of this
object. The presence of such a feature is characteristic of AGB stars with oxygen-enriched
atmospheres. The lithium 6707 ˚A doublet was measured quite conﬁdently in the spectra of
IRAS 18123+0511, but the calculated lithium abundance is extremely low. This can be ex-
plained by the destruction of lithium under the conditions of convection. The abundances
of s-process heavy metals is low compared to the metallicity: their average values are 0.6
the solar value. In general, the pattern of atmospheric abundances in IRAS 18123+0511
is consistent with our concept of a massive star in the early AGB stage. Its metallicity,
combined with its radial velocity and Galactic latitude, indicates that it belongs to the
old Galactic-disk population.

It is interesting to compare our results for RAFGL 5081 with those obtained earlier
for the cool supergiant V1027 Cyg, which is the optical counterpart of IRAS 20004+2955.
That source also lacks radio spectroscopy, however, SAO 6-m spectra were used to de-
termine the fundamental parameters of the atmosphere of the central star and the abun-
dances of a large number of elements [20]. Later, based on the results of monitoring
V1027 Cyg with the NES spectrometer on the 6-m telescope, a feature that was previ-
ously unknown for stars close to the AGB was detected in its spectrum [21]. Klochkova et
al. [21] discovered splitting of the cores of strong absorption lines of metals and their ions
(Si II, Ni I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, Cr I, Fe I, Fe II, Ba II). It turned out that the broad proﬁles
of strong lines contain a stable weak emission feature in the line cores, which splits the
proﬁle into components. It was shown that the mean position of the emission features
can be considered to be a systemic velocity, Vsys = 5.5 km/s. In addition, symmetric
weak and moderate absorption features displayed slight changes in radial velocity with
an amplitude of 5–6 km/s, due to pulsations. The results of radial velocity measurements
based on the positions of the components of the strongest absorption lines in the spec-
trum of V1027 Cyg were a mystery. The accuracy of measurements of the position of the
full proﬁle of a split absorption line is lower than the accuracy of the components of the
proﬁle itself due to asymmetry, but this accuracy is suﬃcient to draw conclusions about
the behavior of the position of the proﬁle with time. The position of the complete proﬁle
remains essentially constant, and does not correspond to the velocity derived from weak
absorption features. This can be understood if strong lines forming in the outer layers of
the atmosphere are stationary, and are not aﬀected by pulsations. These considerations
lead to the conclusion that the circumstellar envelope of V1027 Cyg is fairly stable.

Studying the spectra of the optical counterpart of RAFGL 5081, we again see the split-
ting of absorption features. However, as follows from the discussion in the previous sec-
tions, the properties of the optical spectrum of RAFGL 5081 diﬀer from those detected in
other stars with IR excesses. Currently, with the very limited observational data available
for this object, we cannot identify ﬁrm explanations for its spectral features, but we can
make some guesses. Judging from the IR uxes measured in [1], RAFGL 5081 is located in
region IV on the [12-25]–[25-60] IR-color diagram presented in [22], which contains stars
with high mass-loss rates and optically thick circumstellar envelopes. In addition, the
spectral energy distribution of RAFGL 5081 [1] indicates that the envelope has not yet
separated from the central star. Since the temperature of the central star is low, and is

not suﬃcient to excite the emission of the nebula, the nebula radiates due to scattering of
the radiation of the star. This suggests that we are observing an extended and outowing
pseudo-photosphere.

As in the case of the V1027 Cyg spectrum, it would be natural to suggest envelope
emission formed near the surface layers of this pseudo-photosphere as a factor leading to
the splitting of the absorptions in the spectrum of RAFGL 5081. The position of this emis-
sion would coincide with the velocity of the emission component in the long-wavelength
wing of the Hα line, which can be clearly distinguished at some times in Fig. 1. The large
widths of the emission and absorption lines can be explained by both rotation and a
high macroturbulence velocity in the pseudo-photosphere. However, the presence of en-
velope emission features is not consistent with the fact that the emission intensity in the
RAFGL 5081 spectrum is independent of the excitation potential of the line. One way to
explain the splitting of the absorption lines is to suppose the formation of a large-scale
structure that can be considered a predecessor of future rotating torus, disk, or pair of
lobes in the extended pseudo-photosphere of the cool supergiant. Freytag et al. [23] per-
formed simulations of the complex structure of the surface observed with a high spatial
resolution for nearby AGB stars. In particular, they noted that the origin of the asym-
metry of images of AGB stars could be deep convection in the form of giant, long-lived
convective cells.

In essence, the observed structure of a proto-planetary nebula shell is a record of the
evolution of the central stars mass loss. There currently exist successful theoretical models
that can explain the formation of such a complex morphology during the evolution of a
single AGB star. K¨oning et al. [24] suggested a PPN model based on a pair of cavities of
reduced density inside a dense spherical halo, and showed that it is possible to reproduce
all the morphological features observed in real bipolar PPNs through variation of the
model parameters (density, dimensions, and orientation of the cavity)

The need for continued studies of the IR source RAFGL 5081 using high-resolution
spectroscopy on the largest telescopes, in order to determine the parameters of the at-
mosphere model and calculate the elemental abundances, is clear to us. Observations
with high spatial resolution, as well as photometric monitoring, radio spectroscopy, and
spectropolarimetry, would also be useful. Spectropolarimetry with high spectral resolu-
tion would enable clariﬁcation of the positions of areas of formation of diﬀerent spectral
features, and, consequently, of the structure of the RAFGL 5081 system. The results of
spectropolarimetric observations of the IR source RAFGL 2688 [25] are relevant here. The
circumstellar envelope of that object has a complex structure due to bipolar and jet outows
from the central post-AGB star, with its outer, spherical envelope formed in the previous
AGB stage. The complex structure of such an envelope begins to form after the transition
from a spherical wind in the AGB stage to a superwind in the subsequent stage [26]. To
develop possibilities for polarimetric observations with high spectral resolution, an echelle
spectropolarimeter designed to operate at the primary focus of the SAO 6-m telescope is
currently in the assembly stage [27, 28].

Our interpretation of the multicomponent Na I (1) proﬁles is supported by the pres-
ence of Na I (1) components with the same velocities in the spectra of several distant
Galactic stars located in similar directions. For example, as part of the PPN spectroscopy
program, we studied the optical spectrum of IRAS 23304+6147 in detail [29] (Galactic

coordinates l/b≈ 113◦/0◦). This remote object belongs to a small subgroup of PPN with
atmospheres enriched in s-process products [13]. In the current context, it is important
that an interstellar component of the Na I (1) lines with the velocity Vr(IS) =−61.6 km/s
was identiﬁed in the optical spectrum of IRAS 23304+6147 [16], similar to the case of
RAFGL 5081. Moreover, the spectrum of this object also contains a circumstellar compo-
nent of the Na I (1) lines with velocity Vr =−41.0 km/s, close to the velocity observed in
the spectrum of RAFGL 5081. The circumstellar origin for this component in the spec-
trum of IRAS 23304+6147 is conﬁrmed by the excellent coincidence with the velocity
derived from the rotational lines of the C2 Swan bands. A similar pattern of interstel-
lar components is also detected in the spectrum of VES 695 – the optical counterpart
of IRAS 00470+6429 [30], with Galactic coordinates l/b≈ 122◦/2◦. As was shown by
Miroshnichenko et al. [30], this B[e]-type star is located at a distance of ≈2 kpc, and is
probably a member of the Cas OB7 association.

Consideration of the small number of available publications concerning RAFGL 5081
suggests that its optical counterpart is an unnamed weak star mentioned in the catalog
of van den Berg [31], where it is noted that reﬂection nebula No. 7 is associated with a
weak star to the south of RZ Cas. This nebula is designated GN 02.44.7 in the modern
catalog of reﬂection nebulae [32]. According to SIMBAD, the coordinates of RAFGL 5081
and nebula GN 02.44.7 coincide.

5. Conclusion

Based on long-term (2001–2015) spectral monitoring with high resolution performed on
the SAO 6-m telescope using the NES spectrograph, we have obtained for the ﬁrst time
optical spectra of the optically weak IR source RAFGL 5081.

Based on a comparison with related objects, the spectral type of the star is close
to G58 II. This spectral type is consistent with the eﬀective temperature of the
star, Teﬀ = 5400±100 K, estimated using spectral criteria. The equivalent width of the
O I 7773 ˚A oxygen triplet in the spectrum of the optical counterpart, W(OI) = 0.84 ˚A,
provides the preliminary estimate of the luminosity of RAFGL 5081 Mbol = −4m. This low
luminosity rules out the possibility that the object is a massive red supergiant. Li I 6707 ˚A
absorption is reliably identiﬁed in the spectrum of the counterpart of RAFGL 5081; its
equivalent width, Wλ ≈ 0.1 ˚A, testiﬁes that this object is a relatively massive AGB star
with initial mass Minit ≥ 4M⊙.

The heliocentric radial velocities Vr corresponding to the positions of all components
of metallic absorption lines, as well as the Na I D and Hα lines, have been measured
for all the observation dates. Analysis of the multicomponent proﬁles of the Na I (1) lines
revealed the presence of components with Vr(IS) =−65 km/s. Based on this, we concluded
that RAFGL 5081 is located in the Perseus arm, i.e., no closer than 2 kpc.

An unusual spectral phenomenon was found in the spectra of the star: the broad proﬁles
of medium- and low-intensity absorption lines are split and, unlike the wind absorption
lines, stationary. The constance ofthese absorption lines rules out that the anomalous
absorption proﬁles are due to binarity.

The radial velocities of the wind components of the Na I D and Hα lines reach values
of −250 and −600 km/s, respectively. These proﬁles contain narrow components, whose

number, depths, and positions vary with time. The time variability of the multicomponent
structure of the Na I D and Hα proﬁles indicate inhomogeneity and instability of the
circumstellar envelope of RAFGL 5081.
