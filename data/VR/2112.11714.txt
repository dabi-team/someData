Abstract

To adapt to diﬀerent environments, human circadian rhythms will be
constantly adjusted as the environment changes, which follows the
principle of survival of the ﬁttest. According to this principle, objec-
tive factors (such as circadian rhythms, and light intensity) can be
utilized to control time perception. The subjective judgment on the
estimation of elapsed time is called time perception. In the physical
world, factors that can aﬀect time perception, represented by illumina-
tion, are called the Zeitgebers. In recent years, with the development
of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, eﬀective control of zeitgebers has
become possible, which is diﬃcult to achieve in the physical world.

The Time Perception Control and Regulation in VR Environment

Based on previous studies, this paper deeply explores the actual per-
formance in VR environment of four types of time zeitgebers (music,
color, cognitive load, and concentration) that have been proven to have
a certain impact on time perception in the physical world. It dis-
cusses the study of the measurement of the diﬀerence between human
time perception and objective escaped time in the physical world.

Keywords: Time Perception, Zeitgebers, Cognitive Load, Immersive Virtual
Environments

1 Introduction

Humans’ time perception is a distinct perception from the other ﬁve senses:
sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste[1, 2]. We cannot feel time, since it is
not a three-dimensional entity, and it is generally believed that humans do not
have a speciﬁc organ to feel time[3, 4]. Time perception is represented by the
aggregation of diﬀerent cognitive senses, for example, the classic physiological
model of the Pacemaker-Counter Process considers time perception as a linear
system[5]. In other words, when we get new information, our brain needs to
ﬁrst reorder it and then deliver it to other parts of the brain. That is the reason
why we feel time ﬂows slower when exposed to an unfamiliar environment or
new information since our brain needs longer time to process[6]. To sum up,
when we are under some speciﬁc situations, our brain will work harder to
collect and process information. In that case, we will feel time seems to be
stretched and pass slower.

The time perception can be manipulated by some objective factors since
human circadian rhythms will adjust to the changes of the environment. For
example, although the human biological clock can be expressed as naturally
as a pre-programmed program, it can be inﬂuenced by the light-dark cycle[7],
temperature changes[8], time of three meals, social activities[9], and other
factors. Generally, these factors are signals from the environment that coordi-
nate the circadian rhythm of humans with the external environment and are
therefore called zeitgebers.

As early as 1965, Aschoﬀ has proposed the basic concept of zeitgeber[10],
and pointed out that the most important and direct zeitgeber in nature is
”light”, which has an irreplaceable inﬂuence on human health[11]. More Specif-
ically, diﬀerent external light will send optical signals to the biological clock by
passing through the retina’s optic nerve every morning or evening[12]. After
receiving these signals, the biological clock will regulate the corresponding cir-
cadian rhythm under the aﬀection of this zeitgeber. This can also explain why
ancient people work when the sunrise and rest when the sunset. Zeitgeber has

VIVE Pro Head Mounted Display (HMD). They will ﬁrst be asked to familiarize themselves
with the VR environment, then conduct color and music experiments. Then, the subjects
were asked to wear a portable EEG device (TGAM) to conduct cognitive load and concen-
tration experiments, and based on this experiment, the tension experiment was carried out.
By collecting and analyzing data, this paper aims to ﬁgure out the impact of ﬁve zeitgebers
on users’ time perception in the immersive virtual environment.

been used in many areas of life[13, 14], mainly in the medical ﬁeld[15], the
patient’s time perception can be changed by using drugs or hypnosis[16].

In recent years, the rapid development of VR (Virtual Reality) technol-
ogy makes us start thinking about whether the zeitgeber, which has been
widely used in the physical world, can also aﬀect the virtual world. However,
some researches have shown that situation in VR is diﬀerent[17]. On the other
hand, the application of zeitgeber in VR has much greater potential than in
the physical world. Not only because many IVEs (Immersive Virtual Environ-
ments) support near-natural audio-visual stimuli(Figure 2), similar to those
we generate in the physical world, but also most physical parameters can be
modiﬁed in VR environment[18]. The basis and rationale for the classiﬁcation
in (Figure 2) will be explained in later sections

Our work is inspired by [17], in which Liao et al. study various zeitgebers
for their experiments. For example, Liao divides the zeitgeber into auditory
and visual, while this paper divides them into short-time and long-time. As
the name implies, the former acts on a few minutes, or even a few seconds of
time perception. It is mostly used to aﬀect the user’s instantaneous reaction
speed. The latter acts on subjective time estimation over a period of time and
have a signiﬁcant impact on the overall experience of a given environment.
There are two reasons for this design. Firstly, the visual zeitgeber has not been
found to have signiﬁcant potential in the VR experiment, and its inﬂuence
on time perception is not stable. Secondly, emotional stimulation for a long
time (2-6 min) will decrease the arousal degree compared with the stimulation

with a short time, and prolonged-time usually has greater eﬀects on user’ time
perception (especially in VR)[19].

Addtionally, immersion is not considered as a variable which has eﬀect
on time perception in this paper. The ﬁrst reason is that conclusion about
immersion is usually not convincing enough due to the lack of a complete set of
methods for quantifying immersion. The second reason is that some researches
suggest that immersion and time perception may be separated[20] and do not
seem to change the time perception[21].

We hope to ﬁnd out the eﬀect of several important zeitgebers on time
perception, rather than simply determine whether it is related to the time
perception. Therefore, we selected four representative and signiﬁcant zeitgeber
to study.

3 Theoretical Basis of Zeitgebers

3.1 Audiovisual Zeitgebers: Color and Music

When we were investigating diﬀerent zeitgebers, we noticed a unique factor
called color. Color can regulate time perception by aﬀecting human mood and
instantaneous reaction time, that’s a short time. The most typical example is
the red warning lights used by ambulances to alert surrounding people in an
emergency. Indeed, in the physical world, some applications using color as a
long-time zeitgeber, such as the use of diﬀerent colors to regulate the mood
of guests during dining, to achieve a higher turnover rate[22, 23]. To sum up,
color is an extremely important zeitgeber in the physical world, and one of the
few factors that can aﬀect short-term time estimation.

However, in a VR environment, we only focus on the short-time eﬀects of
color. It is generally believed ability to react to changes in short time inter-
vals may share the same mechanism as time perception, which means we
could quantify human’s time perception by measuring their fast-paced move-
ment perception of the physical world, and we assume that the inﬂuence of

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

The Time Perception Control and Regulation in VR Environment

the diﬀerent color for time perception in short interval may have obvious
diﬀerence[24].

Whether in the physical[25] or the virtual world[26], red is the color that
has the best performance in attracting people’s attention. It is commonly seen
in many dangerous marks or advertising. In the physical world, many stud-
ies have explored the eﬀect of color on time perception. One of the typical
researches is, red is better than blue to make participants concentrate under
short visual stimulation conditions[27, 28]. This type of research is generally
conducted by presenting participants with a computer screen and asking them
to compare the duration of two diﬀerent colors[29]. These researches lack fur-
ther exploration on the practical application of result. We proposed a more
realistic application of the experiment to verify the impact of diﬀerent colors
on time perception.

Since color may have a signiﬁcant eﬀect as a short-time zeitgeber in VR,
what is the typical long-term zeitgeber corresponding to it? Corresponding
to it, we chose music as long-time zeitgeber, not only because they are both
indispensable and important parts of the VR environment, but also because
the current research on the eﬀect of music on the time perception has not been
very conclusive.

Speciﬁcally, as an indispensable element in the VR environment, back-
ground music plays a vital role, it can greatly improve the gaming experience
and sense of immersion of VR games[30]. By arousing speciﬁc emotions,
music can aﬀect human time perception indirectly[31]. However, most current
researches focus on exploring the inﬂuence of music on players’ concentration,
immersion, and other factors[32]. Their experiment conclusions are generally
based on analyzing participant heart rate[33] and EEG data[34], few consider
the participant’s sense of time. Also, these experiments are too focused on
the experiment itself, for example, the participant is only allowed to listen to
music during the experiment. The degree to which music in a game aﬀects the
user experience may be related to whether the player is noticed of the music,
and in some cases, the music may be ignored when the player’s sense is being
aﬀected by other factors of the game[35]. Therefore, we should not only select
suitable background music, but also select a suitable testing environment that
will not interfere with the background music.

3.2 Psychological Cognitive Eﬀect Zeitgebers: Cognitive

Load and Attention

Regrettably, previous studies on color and music have no deﬁnitive conclu-
sion since the inﬂuence of some environment variables, particularly immersion.
Although our experiment design has learned from and improved this point,
it is still diﬃcult to make a qualitative leap in conclusion. In that case, we
wanted to ﬁnd zeitgebers that had a vital eﬀect on the time perception, and
it must possess realistic meaning. After much deliberation, we settled on cog-
nitive load and attention. Both of them are concepts put forward by cognitive
psychology. Essentially, they regulate the sense of time by inﬂuencing the

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

The Time Perception Control and Regulation in VR Environment

psychological cognitive eﬀect[36]. Especially in the circumstances which have
obvious individual diﬀerences reﬂected more signiﬁcant eﬀects[37].

For former, even in some studies[17], cognitive load is considered as a par-
allel factor to zeitgeber, but we take it as an important zeitgeber[38]. Related
research has also been applied to the safe driving system, using professional
eye tracker and external conditions to judge the intensity of cognitive load,
and then infer the reaction time to cope with diﬀerent cognitive load in real
road conditions[38]. We designed an experiment to investigate users’ estimates
of time elapsed in a VR environment under diﬀerent cognitive loads. In part
of researches, cognitive load is one of the most important zeitgebers, which
has a signiﬁcant impact on time estimation in reality[39]. People under high
cognitive load are more likely to be impulsive than those who under low cog-
nitive load, that is, people under high cognitive load feel time ﬂows slower. In
general, cognitive load is the most important part of this paper, and the eﬀect
of cognitive load in virtual reality environment still need to explore, since we
strongly explore the eﬀect of cognitive load on time perception.

For latter, Attention is a zeitgeber that we realized during experiment, we
found through the questionnaire survey that in many cases, data could not
explain the phenomenon, because the individual diﬀerences of users were too
obvious. Therefore, in the second half of our research, we supplemented atten-
tion data collected using EEG devices as an important attempt to quantify
individual diﬀerences.

Attention is one of the most important Zeitgebers which partly reﬂect
individual diﬀerences and state of the participant when testing. Its impact on
the time perception is usually considered to by inﬂuencing Perceived Duration
of Intervals[36], which has an important position in many physiological models
of time perception[4, 40].

4 Methods for Quantifying Zeitgebers

4.1 Maximum Reaction Interval of Color

In this paper, a user-oriented HSV(Hue, Saturation, Value) color model was
adopted to explore the color inﬂuence on time. As the HSV value is high,
the color is bright and white, and it has been proved is proportional to
the color sensitivity[41, 42]. To reﬂect the impact of diﬀerent color systems
on the time perception, rather than making them more eye-catching using
brightness(value), we set the same value in HSV for test colors(Table 1).

To ensure that the experimental results have practical application signif-
icance, rather than simply reproducing the previous experiments in the VR
environment again, our experimental design is based on the function of color in
VR games. This is because how to draw the player’s attention through color as
a reminder in a highly complex environment with multiple colors in VR is an
important issue. Also, whether a VR scene can be modiﬁed to enhance player
immersion by changing the tone of the scene, and has profound application
potential. In this experiment, the Minecraft T M (Mojang Studios, 2009)i envi-
ronment was set up in VR. To simulate a game session, we built a puzzle-type
game in a dark basement. As shown in Figure 3, in the center of the basement
there is a screen with light blocks of diﬀerent colors. The left side of the screen
is a red light block set as the control group, and the right one is test colors
for the experimental group. This ﬁgure shows that subjects only face walls
and test light blocks, while behind is the circuit system built using the game
module. As a result, the subjects were not disturbed by colors other than the
walls. While the walls simulate the ambient color of the real application, we
set them relatively dim to maximize the impact of the test light blocks.

The experiment design refers to the time discrimination principles[24],
namely, test the participants’ time perception by conducting them to judge
the order in which the lights go out. Each participant will undergo 4 tests for 4
test colors. In the initial condition with both lights on, the red light was ﬁxed
for 1,000 ms after the participants pulled the switch. At the beginning, the test
light was lit for 700ms, then the participants need to decide which light went
out ﬁrst. If they can still choose the right light block, extending the test light
block lighting time by 10ms and then ask them to make a judgment again,
until the participants could no longer tell the diﬀerence between the two light
blocks. Their sensation about the diﬀerence were recorded and classiﬁed into

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

three categories: clear, vague, and invisible. It is noted that when the criti-
cal scintillation frequency is reached at 70Hz, scintillation cannot be perceived
by the human eyes, but the light modulation can still be sensed slightly[43].
Therefore, we estimated that the participants could not extinguish the time
diﬀerence when the time interval between two lights was less than 15ms and
chose 10ms as the interval to continuously reduce the time interval.

Based on previous studies and inferences, we make the following hypothesis:
for diﬀerent test color, the results of diﬀerent participants will be signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent.

The speciﬁc logic is shown in Algorithm 1, ﬁrstly we deﬁne s as sensitivity
of participants in the current time interval. s = 0,2,3 represents invisible, vague
and clear respectively. Therefore, the ideal situation is that s is always equal to
3 and the graph is a straight line parallel to the horizontal axis. Then, since it
is much easier to change from clear to vagueness (3 to 2) than from vagueness
to invisibility (2 to 0), we double the weight of the latter.

Secondly, in order to quantify the user’s sensitivity to color, we deﬁne a
variable: Maximum Reaction Interval. We use MRI to represent it in rest text.
MRI is inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the color, which is the shaded
part in Figure 4. This ﬁgure is one group of the test data, and the test light
color is CadetBlue. Node x is where the participants’ sensitivity jumped from
s=3 to s=2, and node y for s=2 to s=0(from the most left side and take the
absolute value). In that case, the larger the value of x and y is, the earlier the
time interval between two lights can be observed. Therefore, Area is inversely
proportional to the participant’s sensitivity to color, which is equivalent to a
deducted score. In other words, the larger the Area of the grey part (x +2y) is,
the larger the time interval is needed to be observed, and the less sensitive the
participants are to this color. Before analyzing the data, we used the Isolation

Forest method to screen for outliers and removed three sets of data that were
clearly outside the reasonable range Table 2).

Fig. 4 A Sample Set Data for Color Experiment

It can be clearly seen from the Table 2 that the area in grey is signiﬁcantly
higher than the other three in terms of average or total value. Indeed, from
common sense and previous studies, grey is almost one of the least obvious col-
ors, which can be used to delay instantaneous response and prolong subjective
time perception.

4.2 Pace and Matching Degree of Music

To simulate this game section, we selected four scenes provided by SteamVR,
all of which are game themes suitable for players to explore. For example, one
of the scenes is taken from the VR game Half-Life: AlyxTM T M (Valve, 2020)ii.

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

The Time Perception Control and Regulation in VR Environment

In the selection of experimental music, to avoid the inﬂuence of language on
the participant, and to make the experiment music play the role of background
music to the greatest extent, all experiment music selected from the original
soundtrack of the movies and games. Also, all of them are edited into the audio
clip of the same length based on not aﬀecting the musicality. At the same time,
to avoid the subjective inﬂuence brought by the music selection, each scene
contains two sets of experimental music, one has a faster pace, the other one
has a slower pace.

For each experiment scene, four groups of music will be tested: two of
them are experimental music, as the experimental group, one is the light music
control group, and the other is the no music control group. The testing time of
four experiments is controlled at the same length, nor each experiment scene,
four groups of music will be tested: two of them are experimental music, as
the experimental group, one is the light music control group, and the other is
the no music control group. The testing time of four experiments is controlled
at the same length, ninety seconds, and the participants are not informed of
the testing time in advance. After the music starts playing, the participant is
allowed to move freely in the scene and explore; when the music stop playing,
the participant needs to answer his subjective length of time. Also, at the start
of the experiment, the participant needs to explore the scene for one minute
and this time length will be informed. This is to let participant has a basic
concept of the speed of the time and avoid large diﬀerences in the experimental
results of diﬀerent participants.

The selection of the four scenes and their test music is shown in Table 3. The
second scene, Stormwind, for example, is taken from the famous MMORPG
(Massively Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game) World of Warcraft T M
(Blizzard Entertainment, 2004)iii, the main City of the Alliance in World of
Warcraft. In this experiment, we chose Stormwind (City Theme) and Legend
of Zelda Main Theme Medley as the test music of the two experimental groups.
The latter comes from the well-known Japanese RPG(Role-playing Game),
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild T M (Nintendo, 2017)iv game sound-
track. The two distinct test music groups were chosen as the experimental
group to study the matching degree, which will be explained in detail later.

4.3 Split-attention Eﬀect of Cognitive Load

The design of this experiment refers to the map exploration part of the open-
world game, how players can reach the designated position faster after receiving
the task assigned by NPC(non-player character). Unlike PC or console plat-
forms, VR devices are not easy to wear, so players cannot search strategy online
while playing. Therefore, a VR game developer needs to set clearer instruc-
tions to help the player ﬁnish the task when the game scene contains complex
elements.

We designed a pathﬁnding mission, set up an MC environment like the
color experiment, and designed three diﬀerent routes. After a certain amount of

prediction tests, it was proved that the three routes have the almost same com-
plexity. This is for preventing that experience the same route more times will
bring diﬀerent proﬁciency, which may lead to the deviation of the result. The
subjects were tested three times and followed a given guide. High, medium, and
low, three cognitive loads were randomly assigned to the three routes, which
corresponded to the text guide, graphic guide, and video guide, respectively.
For the volume of participants, G*power was used for a priori estimation
to determine how much sample size we needed to draw a strong conclusion.
We chose the single-tail test. Although the single-tailed test cannot reach
the signiﬁcance level of the two-tailed test, it is more sensitive to exploring
whether there is a strong correlation between the two parameters. Besides,
the experiment has a strong directional expectation. In other words, according
to previous studies(higher CL brings slower time), we are sure that the low-
probability event on one side will not happen. Generally, α was selected as 0.05,
statistical test power (1-β) was selected as 0.8, and the eﬀect size was selected
as 0.8. For the simulation results obtained, 32 groups of data are needed. In
that case, we selected 12 volunteers to carry out 36 groups of experiments. All
the participants were exposed to the VR environment for the ﬁrst time.

Cognitive load theory is referred to explain why diﬀerent types of guid-
ance diﬀer in cognitive load. Speciﬁcally, the limited processing capacity of
the human brain severely limits the acquisition of complex cognitive skills.
The famous cognitive psychologist John Sweller ﬁrst proposed this theory in
1988, its theoretical system is gradually improved. The present cognitive load
theory provides Structuring Instruction to promote teaching eﬃciency, such
as the famous goal-free Eﬀect[44]. Our experiment uses the split-attention
eﬀect[45], which means replacing multiple sources of information with one
integrated source can reduce cognitive load[46]. This eﬀect was why we set
diﬀerent cognitive loads by text, graphic, and video guidance. Also, this eﬀect
mainly inﬂuences novices, which exactly corresponds to the participants who
are exposed to MC (VR platform) for the ﬁrst time.

5 Experimental Results and Analysis

5.1 Eﬀect of Color on Reaction Speed

In the previous section, we use observational method directly to compare MRI
to determine color sensitivity. However, the conclusion obtained from this
aspect has some limitations, because we did not consider the changing trends
of s of each participant. Therefore, ﬁnally, according to the above data, the s
of all participants in each time interval are regularized and averaged, and the
average ﬁlter is used to remove the high-frequency information in the curve
and obtain the changing trend of the sensitivity of the 4 colors under diﬀerent
time intervals(Figure 5). The ideal situation in this case is that all participants
have a sensitivity of 3, which is 1 after regularizing.

Fig. 5 Normalized Sensitivity of Four Colors at Diﬀerent Extinction Intervals

For a highly sensitive color, the regularized mean value of s should change
more smoothly in this case. This is because the smaller the area corresponding
to the color with higher sensitivity, the less drastic change in the overall mean
value. Judging from the slope of each curve, cadet blue and grey are still the
most and least vivid colors, respectively. It should be noted that although the
blue in Figure 5 reaches its peak at the latest, it only proves that this color
is too early from the transition point of clear and vague perception, and this
shows no obvious connection with sensitivity.

Based on the above analysis, our conclusion is: in the VR environment, the
user’s sensitivity to the four colors is cadet blue ¿ chartreuse ≥ yellow ¿ grey.
The use of highly sensitive colors is conducive to enhancing the player’s instant
response and shortening the time estimation. Indeed, in the questionnaire sur-
vey after the experiment, we found that the experiment time of sensitive color
is estimated to be shorter.

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

As mentioned above, we chose these colors to avoid the inﬂuence of the
value in the HSV model, namely the brightness, on the experimental results.
In this case, according to MRI and weighted by the slope(Figure 5) of the
normalized sensitivity curve (CadetBlue: 0.40, Chartreuse: 0.51, yellow: 0.80,
grey: 0.75), we can get the following color sensitivity spectrum with the most
sensitive color red as the reference. The closer the color is to red, the more
conducive to enhancing the reaction speed. The faster the reaction, the faster
the subjective time, the shorter the estimated time.

Fig. 6 Color Sensitivity Spectrum (take red as reference)

5.2 Limited Inﬂuence of Music

In order to explore whether BPM will aﬀect users’ time perception, a normal
distribution test is conducted on Music Data. First, we treated control group
2 as a comparison and did not add it in test process. After that, all the data
in the same scene were tested, and then the data of same music type (same
test group) were tested. This is because we may conduct comparative analysis
on the scene or music in the experimental analysis part, so we need to conﬁrm
that the data are normal from both directions. Speciﬁcally, each scene contains
32 groups of experimental data, and each test group(music type) contains 24
groups of data. TD (Time Diﬀerence) is used as the test target, and Shapiro-
Wilk test is used as the test method. The reason for using Shapiro-Wilk test
is that each group of data is not more than 32 groups, which is a small sample
test. When the output p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, the data can
be considered as normal distribution [47]. The speciﬁc test results are shown
in Table 4(EG: Experimental Group, CG: Control Group). It can be seen that
the data are normal in all aspects.

To explore whether the pace of music aﬀects the player’s perception of
time, we performed a Kendall tau test, a non-parameter hypothesis test, to

determine their relevance [48]. To calculate the Kendall rank correlation coef-
ﬁcient tau, we ranked the pace of music according to its BPM and the time
diﬀerence according to its value, speciﬁc logic can be seen in Algorithm 2.

After determining that the data were normally distributed, we chose the
Kendall Tau Test, a nonparametric hypothesis test, to determine their cor-
relation. Since we conducted a total of 96 groups of tests in four scenarios,
the experimental results are too much. Here, we only show the results of one
experiment scenario(Table 5).

Firstly, TD(time diﬀerence) is the diﬀerence between the subjective esti-
mate time and the objective elapsed time in percent. For TD of -40% and
above, the subjective time estimation is 40% shorter than the objective time,
classiﬁcation method is shown in algorithm 2. Then, we divided the music into
ﬁve levels according to the rhythm. In this example, music with levels 1, 2,
and 3 have BPM(beat per minute) of 87.71, 101.55, and 115.66, respectively.
Sencondly, we conducted statistics on the data to ﬁnd the Kendall rank
correlation coeﬃcient(Equation 1) to determine whether there was a strong
correlation between the sequences, and Concordant and Discordant represent
C and D in equation. Correlation coeﬃcient obtained is 0.3125, for other

three groups are 0.0625,0.0360 and -0.2656. It indicates that the pace does not
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the time perception of testers.

Additionally, we also explored the impact of the degree of matching between
music and game scene on time cognition. Unfortunately, due to individual dif-
ferences, this parameter has not much reference value. Take Stormwind scenes
as an example. In theory, most participants should think that the former sound-
track(Table 3 experimental group1) matches the experimental scene better.
However, the results were surprising. Only half of the participants thought
that the Stormwind was more compatible with the scene, and a considerable
part of participants thought that it was not even as good as the light music.

Undoubtedly, music that better matches the scene will increase the player’s
immersion, thereby aﬀecting the player’s time perception. However, in reality, a
gamer who often play Japanese RPG game will not suddenly try a western-style
RPG game which is in a completely diﬀerent style. In other words, participant
A’s data in our experiment has no practical meaning. Moreover, the matching
degree cannot be perfectly quantiﬁed. In the experiment, we selected two sets of
music with totally diﬀerent styles, but in the practical situation, this parameter
will largely depend on the participant’s personal preference when the selected
music is in a similar style.

Since the matching degree has no obvious eﬀect on the time perception,
what is the reason for the huge diﬀerence in the user’s estimation of time in
the four scenarios? Our guess was how much the participants liked the music
and the setting, and how familiar they were with it.

Finally, in response to this result, we conducted a more in-depth investiga-
tion and analysis. We collected all types of games that the participants usually

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

16

play(last step in Algorithm 2), and their satisfaction with the test music, and
found that the experimental results are closely related to participants’ gaming
experience. The Figure 7 lists the results of the two sets of experimental music
in this scene. For participants A, he only plays Japanese RPG games, hence
he believes Legend of Zelda is more compatible with the scene, and he shows
a longer time perception in this music. Participants B and C who mainly play
western-style RPG games show the opposite result. They think Stormwind is
more suitable for the scene with faster time perception. For the rest of the
participants, they do not play RPG games, the degree of matching depends
on whether the testing music itself is songful or not.

Fig. 7 The Inﬂuence of Diﬀerent Music on Time Estimation in One Scene

Additionally, Table 6 shows the data of two experimental groups in a spe-
ciﬁc scene . The reason why the control group is not added is that the subjects
generally have no special feeling for the test music of the control group, and
there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in likeability and familiarity. Under the over-
all picture, it can also be seen that the matching degree between scenes and
music does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect time perception. This is because everyone
has a diﬀerent deﬁnition of a matching degree. As can be seen from the table,
almost all participants’ views on the matching degree of the two pieces of test
music are contrary to what we assumed, although we have selected test music
and the original soundtrack with extremely diﬀerent styles.

However, based on the test data of the Stormwind scene, it is the user’s
likeability and familiarity with the scene, music, and other elements that have
the greatest impact on time perception. This point is well reﬂected in the data
of No. 3. This user plays a lot of games in daily life, and most of them are large-
scale games with grand scenes which is quite similar to Stormwind. Because of

this, full marks of likeability and familiarity were given in the questionnaire,
and the test results were much shorter than the pre-set time. On the contrary,
the participant No.7, who had never been exposed to this type of scene but
was very familiar with JRPG (Japanese Role-Play Game) which is group 2
music comes from, showed a sharp contrast between the two test results. In
other words, familiarity with the scene and music helped shorten subjective
time estimates.

Furthermore, due to the limited selection of scenes in Stormwind, it is
diﬃcult to tell whether the likeability of music also aﬀects time perception.
To conﬁrm this, let’s look at data from another scene. It is a neutral scene
that will not be universally objectionable or attractive, which can maximize
the inﬂuence of music-likeability on time perception. We selected two kinds of

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

18

The Time Perception Control and Regulation in VR Environment

light music with diﬀerent styles (Table 3), and asked the subjects to choose the
one they preferred by comparison when ﬁlling in the questionnaire. According
to the data in the table, except for No. 7 and No. 4, all the results prove that
the music users prefer helps to shorten the subjective time estimate.

In summary, background music can not be counted as strong Zeigebers
in a VR environment, either from the aspect of pace or matching degree. As
an art form, music cannot be fully quantiﬁed. The same music can have a
completely diﬀerent listening experience by changing a few timbre and rhythm.
At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that background music lacks
musicality to some extent, and it generally plays the role of the setting of
the atmosphere[49]. It is not feasible for VR environment designers to focus
on background music in the expectation of having a signiﬁcant impact on the
player’s time perception since it can never have a direct eﬀect like game content
or game screen. Thinking about designing a piece of background music that is
as familiar and resonant as possible to the target users will be worked.

As an auxiliary way, background music can never be mighty inﬂuential as
the game content and game graphics. In other words, it cannot play a decisive
role. However, as an auxiliary means to regulate time perception in a virtual
reality environment, music can inﬂuence users’ time perception by aﬀecting
immersion to some extent. On the other hand, if individual diﬀerences can
be eﬀectively quantiﬁed, perhaps the eﬀect of music can be further subdi-
vided. Therefore, we take attention as one of the important manifestations of
individual diﬀerences and add it to the next part.

5.3 Acceleration Eﬀect of Low Cognitive Load

Table 7 synthesizes original data. Through a posterior analysis, we can simply
calculate Cohen’s d is 3.4891, eﬀect size (r) is 0.8675, the sample size is 36.
Then we set α is 0.05, using these parameters to calculate statistical test force,
which is 0.8174, and it is in line with the expectation.

Overall data can support the hypothesis, but only part of the data, mainly
graphic data, is not completely consistent. From the questionnaire and testing
process, we found for some participants, the graphic guidance was not even as
explicit as the text guidance. Someone with a weak ability to analyze picture
elements, text guidance even had a lower cognitive load. That is the reason why
graphic data is not completely consistent. As can be seen from the comparison
of Figure 8, the overall predicted trend remains unchanged with or without
graphic data. The data within the conﬁdence interval is from ordinary players,
and outside are from top players. According to the questionnaire survey, this
is because these participants learned game mechanisms quickly and felt the
task was too simple, thus their actual cognitive load was much lower than the
ordinary player, leading to their faster subjective time estimation.

The diﬀerence of graphic data lies in the correlation coeﬃcient which is 0.51
when graphic data is present and becomes 0.61 when removed. This suggests
that cognitive load is a low-intensity correlation zeitgeber without considering
graphic data, which can play a certain role in time judgment. However, it

The Time Perception Control and Regulation in VR Environment

Fig. 8 Prediction line between CL and TD with (right) and without (left) graphic data
regardless of Attention (conﬁdence level 95%)

can only be regarded as a moderately correlated factor if considering graphic
data. Meanwhile, we use the evaluation function SCORE to determine the
quality of the regression equation. The best score of the SCORE function is
1.0, and a negative value may occur in the case of a poor model. With and
without graphic data, the scores were 0.43 and 0.59, respectively. Therefore,
the disadvantages of graphic data in this analysis can be further demonstrated.

Fig. 9 ROC curve exclude Attention of predicted value and actual value with(a) and with-
out graphic data (b), and include Attention predicted value and actual value with(c) and
without attention (d)

The analysis of the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) gives
us the same conclusion in Figure 9 (a) and (b). Speciﬁcally, which is based on
a series of diﬀerent ways of binary classiﬁcation (boundary value or decision
threshold), with true positive rate as the ordinate and abscissa to draw the
curve of the rate of false positives[50]. The traditional diagnostic test evaluation
methods have a common feature that the test results must be divided into
two categories and then analyzed statistically. ROC curve evaluation method
is diﬀerent from the traditional ones, need not this limit[50]. In conclusion,
the ROC curve evaluation method applies to a wider range, which is also the
reason why this method is used in this paper.

In general, our method of analyzing relevant data is as shown in algorithm
3. Another dimension data (attention) will be added later, but the analysis
process remains the same.

5.4 Embodiment of Individual: Attention

We added data collected by a portable EEG device TGAM to calculate
attention, which reﬂected how focus the participants were. Particularly, an
optimization algorithm was used to improve EEG data[20, 51], and we gener-
ate two parameters: one is attention whose value varying in the range of 0-100,
and the other is attention level divided into eight grades (0-7).

Speciﬁc results are shown in Table 5, where noise/data represents the pro-
portion of noise interference in the collected EEG data, which can reﬂect that
our EEG data has little noise and good quality. As early as 1982 with the
introduction of the EEG equipment analysis of zeitgeber precedent [52], the
experiment explored the eﬀects of sleep on human circadian rhythm using vol-
unteer’s mental health evaluated by EEG data. In our experiment, we only
focus on whether attention contributed to time estimation.

T D = α + γ × CL

(2)

When Attention is not considered, the ﬁnal ﬁtting linear regression
equations is as Equation 2, α and γ equal to -0.63 and 0.21 when includ-
ing graphic data, while it becomes -0.50 and 0.16 when excluding. For the
equation with graphic data, we tried to replace outliers with Lagrange inter-
polation. However, due to the relatively small data set, the eﬀect has not been
signiﬁcantly improved. The CL(Cognitive Load) is set as 3 for text guidance
(high Load), 2 for graphic guidance (medium Load), and 1 for video guid-
ance (low Load). Due to the length of our experiment time, this prediction
equation is more accurate in short-term scenes and has certain reference sig-
niﬁcance for long-term scenes. However, due to insuﬃcient data sets and the
lack of consideration of individual diﬀerences, the prediction results are not
satisfactory.

It can be seen from the above results that lower cognitive load leads to
shorter time estimates. However, some data, especially graphic data, do not

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

The Time Perception Control and Regulation in VR Environment

strongly support this conclusion.The main reason, as in the music experi-
ment, is the inﬂuence of individual diﬀerences. An interesting question can be
proposed: time estimates can also be inﬂuenced by individuals’ diﬀering under-
standings of the interesting, complexity, diﬃcult and other attributes of testing
task[53]. One important parameter that we quantify individual diﬀerence is
Attention.

After the Attention analysis is added, we get four models as shown in
Table 8. In order to prove that the prediction can be more accurate after we
add the Attention analysis, we compare the prediction results with or with-
out graphic data. This is because, through the questionnaire survey and the
previous analysis, the graphic data are the data that can reﬂect the individ-
ual diﬀerences. As can be seen from the data in Table 8, the Score is 0.40 and
0.53 respectively when there is or is not graphic data. ROC curve (Figure 9
(c) and (d)) also gives similar results, the four groups of data in Table 1 is
corresponding to (a) to (d) in Figure 2 respectively. Obviously, image predic-
tion tendency with graphic data and Attention is more consistent with the real
situation, and its ﬁtting degree is higher in both amplitude and tendency.

Finally, the prediction equation with Attention as Equation 3. Speciﬁcally,
β, θ and λ are equal to -0.33, 0.17 and 0.04 respectively. Adding Attention as a
parameter can greatly improve the prediction accuracy with graphic data, and
to some extent, it is even better than eliminating the graphic data directly.

T D = β + θ × CL − λ × Attention level

(3)

Moreover, an interesting phenomenon can be found from the attention data:
the data that cannot prove the positive correlation between cognitive load and
subjective time estimation, such as the graphic data of subjects 6, 7, and 8,
all have signiﬁcantly lower attention in horizontal comparison(Table 7). Fur-
thermore, Due to the task design of our experiment, participants who were
top players or showed low interest in our experiment had low attention per-
formance (e.g. 1, 2). However, participants who showed high attention, longer
time estimation did not fully follow the rule of proportional to cognitive load
(e.g. 6, 7, 8). If we made the task harder, probably the eﬀect of attention would
be even more pronounced. This aspect also shows that we must add attention
to data analysis, which quantiﬁes individual diﬀerences to a certain extent.

There is a connection between attention and time: in general, higher attention
leads to a shorter time estimation.

6 Conclusion

After the above experiment and analysis, we can draw the following conclu-
sions:
• As a short-term zeitgeber, highly sensitive colors are conducive to enhancing
the instantaneous reaction of users and shortening the estimation of time
(CadetBlue ¿ Chartreuse ≥ Yellow ¿ Grey).

• In the VR environment, as an auxiliary method to control time perception
music, is mainly realized by the inﬂuence of immersion. The more famil-
iar and beloved the music is, the more conducive it is to shorten the time
perception.

• Cognitive load and attention are two vital Zeitgebers that aﬀect time per-
ception in VR together. Low cognitive load and high attention speed up
time perception the most.

• Attention reﬂects individual diﬀerences to some extent.

Zeitgebers have some diﬀerent approaches to inﬂuence time perception in
the physical and virtual world(Figure 2). In the VR environment, reasonable
use of the strong correlation between cognitive load and attention on time
perception can optimize the design of scenes. Zeitgebers such as color and
music can also be used as auxiliary methods to regulate time perception. These
may have implications for the physical world as well.

However, due to the inﬂuence of factors as screen resolution and scene
optimization, the principle of time perception in VR is diﬀerent. Learning the
same content, a person in the VR environment will spend less time than a
person in the physical world, also the person in the physical world will feel
time ﬂows slower. [54]. Besides, there is an interaction between immersion and
attention in the VR environment, that is, better immersion leads to higher
attention, which further aﬀects subjective time estimation[55]. Therefore, it
can be said that the VR environment itself has already aﬀected the user’s time
estimation.

7 Limitation & Future Work

There is no doubt that there is more work to be done. The emotion, which is
a vital zeitgeber that can reﬂect the speciﬁc state of the user in the virtual
environment and play a decisive role in the time perception is not taken into
consideration in this study. Particularly, studies have shown that people who
can regulate emotions can reduce or even ignore the impact of emotions on
time perception[56]. However, there are too many kinds of emotions that may
play a role in time perception, and it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd an eﬀective way to
quantify emotions due to the limitations of equipment and the experimental

Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template

24

The Time Perception Control and Regulation in VR Environment

environment. Thus, the emotion is factor emotion is not considered in this
study and it needs more work in the future.

In addition, our researches on color have type limitations, the selection of
experiment colors is restricted by the color brightness. Also, the experiment
method on Zeitgeber music needs to be improved as our data analysis cannot
strongly prove that music has a great impact on time perception. This is
because it is hard to quantify individual diﬀerences and multiple experiments
were conducted in a short time causing the participant familiar more with
the following experiment and leading to the experiment result variance. To
minimize such eﬀect, for the same Zeitgeber, every experiment was separated
by at least 2 days. However, this experiment method still needs to be improved
as the time estimation will be inevitably shorter when the participant is more
familiar with the environment. Furthermore, a higher ecological validity test
environment is necessary. If we can design a highly modular virtual reality
environment, makes the environment variables or factors can be artiﬁcially
adjust, rather than as used in this article some existing VR environment,
presumably can improve the rigor and reliability of the experiment.

As for the limitations, ﬁrst of all, we want to improve the inﬂuence of
emotions on the sense of time. In the physical world, emotion is also a very
important Zeitgeber like attention[57, 58]. In the experiments in this article,
we use 1 and 0 to represent the presence or absence of tension is the simplest
way to quantify emotions, but the eﬀect is not ideal due to various reasons.
Finding a better way to quantify this parameter is valuable.

Secondly, as an important parameter, the level of immersion is vital to
determine the quality of a VR environment whether the user can truly immerse
themselves in the virtual world. Besides, immersion can also be regarded as
a zeitgeber, since certain immersive experiences can make people feel time
ﬂows faster. Although there have been some studies that can refer to[59, 60],
there is no universal method that can eﬀectively parameterize users’ immer-
sion now. Indeed, the diﬃculty of expressing subjective feelings with objective
parameters is not only reﬂected in the hardware conditions but also in data
analysis. In particular, immersion can be subdivided into scene immersion and
emotional immersion[? ], it is very diﬃcult to achieve them at the same time.
In that case, we will also focus on creating a simple, eﬃcient, and low-cost
method to quantify immersion.

B Hardware Setup

Our IVEs ilnclude few parts. Firstly, as illustrated in Fig. 1, participants
wear an HTC VIVE Pro HMD to experiment with the immersive environ-
ment. The HMD provides a resolution of 1440 × 1600 pixels per eye, and the
binocular resolution is 2880 × 1600 with a refresh rate of 90 Hz and an approx-
imately 110 degrees diagonal ﬁeld of view. Secondly, we track its position
and orientation with SteamVRT M tracking system. Finally, we use Neurosky
TGAM(Thinkgear Asic Module) to collect EEG data. Non-immersive display
setup used a monoscopic display without head-tracking, which presented on a
Acer XV272UP display with a resolution of 2560 × 1440 and a refresh rate of
144Hz. We use a workstation for rendering and as the experimental platform,
whose processor is 4.90 GHz 8 Core i7-9700K processor, 32 GB(3200Mhz) of
main memory, and a GeForce GTX 2070 8GB graphics card.
