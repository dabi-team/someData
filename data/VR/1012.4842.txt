Abstract

A simple molecular thermodynamic approach is applied to the study of the
adsorption of gases of chain molecules on solid surfaces. We use a model based
on the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory for Variable Range (SAFT-VR)
potentials [A. Gil-Villegas, A. Galindo, P. J. Whitehead, S. J. Mills, G. Jackson,
A. N. Burgess, J. Chem. Phys. 106 (1997) 4168] that we extend by including
a quasi-two-dimensional approximation to describe the adsorption properties of
this type of real gases [A. Mart´ınez, M. Castro, C. McCabe, A. Gil-Villegas, J.
Chem. Phys. 126 (2007) 074707]. The model is applied to ethane, ethylene,
propane, and carbon dioxide adsorbed on activated carbon and silica gel, which
are porous media of signiﬁcant industrial interest. We show that the adsorption
isotherms obtained by means of the present SAFT-VR modeling are in fair
agreement with the experimental results provided in the literature.

1. Introduction

The main component of natural gas is methane, but small amounts of other
gases such as ethane, ethylene, propane, propadiene, butane, methylpropane,
2-methylpropane, and carbon dioxide are present. These components are in
negligible amounts in natural gas but become a problem when the methane is
stored through adsorption and are less volatile than the methane and therefore
preferentially occupy the active sites of the adsorbent. To solve the problem
of this type of pollutants one must know their speciﬁc adsorbate properties on
various adsorbents at ambient temperatures and a broad range of pressures.

The study of adsorption is very important for designing a good adsorbent.
A correct interpretation and quantiﬁcation of the adsorption isotherms are re-
quired for the development of adsorption technologies in the case of the separa-
tion and puriﬁcation of gases and liquids [1, 2]. A detailed molecular thermo-
dynamic model based on perturbation theory for ﬂuids with highly anisotropic
interactions has been developed by Wertheim [3] some time ago and has been
known as the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) since the works of
Chapman and collaborators [4, 5].

The SAFT approach in three dimensions has been used in a variety of sys-
tems and complexes relevant to the industry, and due to its predictive power
and versatility started to be widely used in chemical engineering. Recently,
Martinez and collaborators [6] modiﬁed the two dimensional form of SAFT-VR
approach (SAFT-VR-2D) to a quasi two-dimensional variant and obtained very
good results in the case of adsorbed gases such as methane and nitrogen on ac-
tivated carbon and in addition for as complex molecules as asphaltene adsorbed
on some natural porous rocks present in an oil well [7].

This paper presents the application of the SAFT-VR formalism, both in the
context of 2D [6, 7, 8] and 3D [9], to obtain the adsorption isotherms of ethane
(C2H4), ethylene (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the
case of activated carbon and silica gel as adsorbents at pressures up to 4 MPa
and for three diﬀerent temperatures.

2. Theory

In this section, we summarize the principal terms that enter the SAFT-VR
model in 2D and 3D and the way we combine them to get the quasi two-
dimensional approximation.

2.1. Adsorption of monomeric ﬂuids

The model consists of a simple ﬂuid of N particles with diameter σ in the
presence of a uniform wall [6, 7]. The interaction exerted by the wall on the
particles is of the square well (SW) type

upw(z) = 


∞ z < 0
−ǫw 0 < z < λwσ
0

λwσ < z ,



2

(1)

where z is the perpendicular distance of the particles from the wall, ǫw is the
depth of the well, and λwσ is the range of the attractive potential.

The system is divided into two subsystems: a ﬂuid whose molecules are near
the wall forming the adsorbed ﬂuid considered as a substrate of the wall and a
ﬂuid whose molecules are far from the wall forming the ﬂuid in the bulk. The
ﬂuids, both the adsorbed and the bulk phases, have diﬀerent properties because
of the presence of the wall. In particular, it is well known that the interaction
between the molecules depends on how close they are to the wall, in other words
the binary interaction between particles is diﬀerent in the adsorbed and the bulk
phases [10]. Thus, the particle density in the ﬂuid, ρ, is a function of z. To
describe the amount of adsorbed particles, we deﬁne the following parameter

∞

Γ =

Z
0

[ρ(z) − ρb]dz ,

(2)

where ρb is the particle density in the bulk region. Since the length scale in the
adsorbed ﬂuid is deﬁned by λwσ, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as

λw σ

Γ =

Z

ρ(z)dz − ρbλwσ

(3)

where the integral in the right hand side of Eq. (3) is the density of the adsorbed

adsorbed phase µads and the bulk phase µb should be equal. Therefore, ρads
can be obtained from the condition

The partition function of the adsorbed ﬂuid is given by

µads = µb .

Zads =

V N
ads
N !Λ3N Qads ,

(4)

(5)

where V N
ads is the volume containing the adsorbed ﬂuid, Λ is the de Broglie ther-
mal wavelength in terms of Planck’s constant, and Qads is the conﬁgurational
partition function of the adsorbed system.

Introducing the adsorption area S, we have Vads = Sλwσ, and Qads can be

rewritten as [6, 7, 8]

Qads = Q1DQ2D ,

(6)

where Q1D and Q2D denote the conﬁgurational partition functions in one and
two dimensions, respectively, and are given by

Q2D =

and

Q1D = exp (−N βupw(z

)) ,

(7)

(8)

where z∗ is that value of the coordinate z that guarantees the mean value of the
Boltzmann factor [6].

Then the ﬁnal expression for the partition function has the following form

ZN = Z ideal

2D QN

(9)

Applying the standard relation A = −kT ln Z, the Helmholtz free energy of the
adsorbed ﬂuid is given by

Aads
N kT

=

A2D
N kT

− ln

λB (cid:19)

(cid:18)

+ βupw ,

(10)

where A2D is the Helmholtz free energy of a two-dimensional ﬂuid with interac-
tions given by the binary potential φ(x, y). In perturbation theory up to second
order, the dimensionless Helmholtz free energy per particle, A2D/N kT , can be
written as follows

A2D
N kT

= ln(ρadsΛ2) +

AHD
N kT

+ βa2D

1 + β2a2D
2

.

(11)

Here AHD is the Helmholtz free energy for hard disks, β = 1/kT , a2D
and a2D
are the ﬁrst two terms of the 2D perturbation expansion. It is worth mentioning
that the expression for Q1D as appears in Eq. (8) is accurate and can be used
to deﬁne the energy parameter of the wall, ǫw. For the simple case where the
wall-particle interaction is given by a square well with range λwσ and energy
depth ǫw, we get upw(z∗) = −ǫw.

A similar expression in perturbations is considered for the ﬂuid in the bulk

Getting the chemical potentials µads and µb from Eqs. (10), (11), and (12), we

µ3D = µ2D + µw ,

where µ3D and µ2D are the chemical potentials in 3D and 2D, respectively, and
µw is the wall contribution to the chemical potential

2.2. Adsorption of chain molecules

In the SAFT-VR framework the theory presented in Subsection 2.1 can be
easily extended to the more general case of adsorption of homonuclear and het-
eronuclear chain molecules [11], which is one of the tasks of this work. In the
simpler case of homonuclear molecules, we consider the ﬂuid as made up of N
molecules each composed of m identical spherical units (monomers) of diameter

4

σ. We assume that both the particle-particle and particle-wall interactions are
described by square-well potentials. The thermodynamic equilibrium between
the bulk phase and the adsorbed phase of the ﬂuid is obtained by imposing the
condition in Eq. (13) of equal chemical potentials. The latter quantities are
derived from the SAFT-VR expressions for the Helmholtz free energies of chain
molecules in 3D and 2D.

SAFT-VR approach. The Helmholtz free energy A of chain molecular gases
is composed of three separate terms [4, 5]: one refers to the ideal gas free energy,
another to the free energy of monomeric units and ﬁnally the term corresponding
to the formation of chain molecules incorporating a given number of monomeric
units

where Ns is the number of monomer units of the chain molecule, and A3D and

grounds obtained from the corresponding radial distribution functions through
the well known relationship y(r) = g(r)eβu(r). Following the SAFT-VR proce-
dure, the functions g(r) are obtained as perturbation expansions

3. Results

A comparison of the theoretical adsorption isotherms with the experimen-
tal results for the following gases C2H4, C2H6, C3H8, and CO2 onto activated
carbon and silica gel is displayed in Figs. 1-12 at diﬀerent temperatures and
pressures. Table I and II show the parameters we have used to describe the
investigated simple ﬂuids both in the bulk phase and the adsorbed phase within
the SAFT-VR approximation [6, 8, 14, 15]. As seen from these tables, ethane,
ethylene, and propane are represented as ﬂuids of non-spherical monomers
(m = 1.2, 1.33, 1.67), while CO2 is represented as a dimer ﬂuid (m = 2). The
molecular diameters σ are the same both in the bulk and the adsorbed phases,
while the parameters of the SW attractive potential are diﬀerent from case to
case. These diﬀerences are due to the inﬂuence of the wall on the substrate of
particles. As mentioned in previous works [6, 7, 8], according to the theoreti-
cal results derived by Sinanoglu and Pitzer for a Lennard-Jones ﬂuid [10], the
energy of the potential well depth for the particle-particle interaction in the ad-
sorbed monolayer is reduced by a factor of 20%-40% with respect to their bulk
phase values. We chose a reduction of 20% in all cases. Once ǫads is selected
in this way, the range λads can be determined by reproducing the experimental
ratios between the critical temperatures of the bulk phase, T b
c , and the adsorbed
phase, T ads
/T b
c . The value of this ratio is known for the case
of noble gases and methane adsorbed on graphite surfaces, Rc ≈ 0.4. Next,
λads was determined from this ratio and the values of the set of parameters
m, σ, ǫ, λ, ǫads for ethane, ethylene, propane and carbon dioxide are those re-
ported in Table 1 and 2. We notice here that at higher conﬁnement regimes
for the ﬂuid, Rc could depend on the degree of conﬁnement for some types of
activated carbon as well as for silica gels and therefore, strictly speaking, our
results apply in the low conﬁnement regime.

, i.e., Rc = T ads

For the range parameter λw we used two values, 0.2453 and 0.8165. The ﬁrst
one corresponds to the value found for the adsorption of noble gases on graphite,
whereas the latter one is the upper limit used to describe the adsorption of a
monolayer according to the mean-ﬁeld approach [16]. The energy parameter was
adjusted to reproduce the experimental adsorption isotherms. In Figures 1-4,
the reported results for the adsorption on activated carbon were conducted at
temperatures of 301.4 and 338.7 K at pressures up to 3.5 MPa. One can notice

the good agreement between theory and experimental data, unless in Figure 3
where our SAFT-VR calculations although not very close to the experimental
data still follow their main trend. Figures 5-12 show the results of adsorption
on silica gel, for three diﬀerent temperatures, i.e., 278, 293, and 303 K. We can
see from these ﬁgures that the theoretical behavior agrees with the experimen-
tal data, except at high pressures where a deviation is noted which may reﬂect
the fact that the molecules are not spherical. Moreover, in the case of carbon
dioxide the quadrupolar contribution is not taken into account and it is known
that it inﬂuences the thermodynamic properties of both the bulk phase and the
adsorbed phases. Another feature that is not taken into account in the model is
the way the molecules adhere to the wall, that is, if their chain structure is per-
pendicular, parallel or diagonal to the wall. Despite these limitations, the model
provides very good theoretical results compared to the available experimental
data.

An advantage of this SAFT-VR thermodynamic model is that one only needs
to know the particle-particle and the wall-particle interaction energies together
with the molecular diameter, and requires the adjustment of only one parameter
that corresponds to the strength of the attraction energy of the wall, but this
adjustment is based on the experimental data of the adsorbate energy Uw, which
is known in the literature as the isosteric heat of adsorption. For example, in the
case of krypton adsorbed on graphite, Uw=11.72 kJ/mol [20] and corresponds
to a value of ǫ=8.168 [16], which is of comparable magnitude to the values used
in this work. On the contrary, other models use at least four parameters to
make adjustments and to reproduce the experimental data of the adsorption
isotherms and usually these models are semi-empirical [21].

4. Conclusions

We have applied the SAFT-VR approach to model adsorption isotherms
of simple ﬂuids with molecules of non spherical shape. To achieve this goal
we used a SAFT-VR approach in which the chemical equilibrium condition in

7

both 3D and 2D has been employed. For the cases of real ﬂuids considered it
is demonstrated that a good ﬁt of these theoretical predictions is obtained by
adjusting only a single parameter, which is the energy of the attraction interac-
tion of the molecules towards the wall. We improved further the predictions by
taking into account the positions of the particles on the wall as well as adding
a new term to the SAFT-VR-2D corresponding to the quasi-two-dimensional
quadrupole approximation. We recall that other semiempirical models available
in the literature [22, 23] make use of at least four adjustable parameters with-
out a clear physical interpretation, whereas the SAFT-VR parameters have a
molecular basis being related to the molecular forces acting in the adsorption
process.

On the other hand, the complicated porous structure of silica gels and some
of the activated carbons is at the origin of the fractal character of their surfaces.
Taking into account this fractality [24] and the distribution of pores in the
SAFT-VR approach implies introducing fractal type parameters that remains
as an interesting issue for future investigation.
