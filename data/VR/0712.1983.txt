Abstract. We report time-resolved V - and R-band CCD photometry of the eclipsing binary
RZ Cas obtained with 38-cm Cassegrain telescope at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory
during July 2004 – October 2005. The obtained lightcurves clearly demonstrates rapid pulsations
with a period of about 22 min. A periodogram analysis of these oscillations is also reported. On
m
12 January, 2005 (JD 2453383) we observed rapid variability with higher amplitude (∼0
.1),
that perhaps may be interpreted as a high-mass-transfer-rate event and inhomogeneity of the
accretion stream. Follow-up observations (both photometric and spectroscopic) of RZ Cas are
strictly desirable for more detailed study of such events.

1. Introduction

The A3V+K0 IV eclipsing binary RZ Cas is an active semi-detached Algol system
showing complex features in its lightcurve. It is well-known for demonstrating rapid pul-
sations (P ∼ 22 min) superimposed over its orbital eclipsing lightcurve. A brief overview
of previous investigations of RZ Cas can be found in Golovin & Pavlenko (2006).

2. Observations

RZ Cas was observed in July 2004 – October 2005 in the V and R bands from the
Crimean Astrophysical Observatory (Ukraine) by the authors, using a 38-cm Cassegrain
telescope equipped with an SBIG ST-7 CCD camera, cooled by a Peltier system to
about −20◦C. The ﬁeld-of-view covered a sky region of 12′ × 8′ and the pixel size was
0′′.9 × 0′′.9. The exposure time was 2s.5 for the R band and 5 or 10s for the V band.
To minimize dead time we used binning by a factor of 2. Data reduction was done
using the “Maxim DL” package. Reduction included bias, dark-frame subtraction and
ﬂat ﬁelding using twilight sky exposures. Since the ﬁeld of RZ Cas is not crowded, the
technique of aperture photometry was applied to extract the diﬀerential magnitudes.
The total number of useful frames was 4365. The brightness of RZ Cas was measured
with respect to GSC 4317−1578 (α = 02◦48′41′′.58; δ = +69◦35′31′′.3; J2000.0), while
GSC 4317−1437 (α = 02◦48′38′′.29; δ = +69◦37′29′′.9; J2000.0) served as a check star.
Unfortunately, no suitable comparison and check star could be including in the frames

(stars are at least 4m fainter than the variable star). The photometric error (determined
from the diﬀerence check star – comparison star ) is about 0m.01. Figure 1 illustrates a
15′ × 15′ image of the RZ Cas region from DSS. Variable, comparison and check stars
are marked.

To rule out the possibility of observing variations caused by the comparison star,
independent photometry of comparison star GSC 4317−1578 was performed with respect
to check star GSC 4317−1437.

3. Discussion

Figure 2 shows brightness variations during the maximal part of the lightcurve. Sep-
arate observing runs are manifested. As could be seen, pulsation amplitude could be
assumed to be about 0m.05 on average. A great deal of interest was caused by the fact
that on 12 January, 2005 (JD 2453383) we observed rapid variability with higher am-
plitude (∼0m.1), that perhaps may be interpreted as a high-mass-transfer-rate event and
inhomogeneity of the accretion stream. Periodogram analysis (Figure 3) reveals the fol-
lowing periods: For 12, January, 2005 :
P1 = 0.041895 ± 0.000849 (F1 = 23.87 ± 0.48)
P2 = 0.021238 ± 0.000218 (F2 = 47.08 ± 0.48)
P3 = 0.017470 ± 0.000148 (F3 = 57.24 ± 0.48)
P4 = 0.014323 ± 0.000099 (F4 = 69.82 ± 0.48)

For all the other remaining nights: P1 = 0.014489 ± 0.000169 (F1 = 69.02 ± 0.80) —
the period of pulsations of RZ Cas. P2 = 0.028354 ± 0.000646 (F2 = 35.27 ± 0.80) —
almost twice the value of P1.

4. Conclusions

We report here photometric observations of RZ Cas’ δ Scuti–like pulsations. We stress
attention to the abrupt increase in amplitude (up to ∼0m.1) on 12 January, 2005 that
perhaps may be interpreted as a high-mass-transfer-rate event and inhomogeneity of
the accretion stream. Follow-up observations (both photometric and spectroscopic) of
RZ Cas are strictly desirable for more detailed study of such events.
