Abstract

In this paper we present the results of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) ob-
servations carried out with the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) array and
the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) toward H2O masers in a young planetary nebula
K 3−35. From the VERA observations we measured the annual parallax and proper mo-
tion of a bright water maser spot in K 3−35. The resulting distance is D = 3.9+0.7
−0.5 kpc.
This is the ﬁrst time that the parallax of a planetary nebula is obtained by observations of
its maser emission. On the other hand, the proper motion of K 3−35 as a whole was esti-
mated to be µα = −3.34±0.10 mas yr−1, µδ = −5.93±0.07 mas yr−1. From these results
we determined the position and velocity of K 3−35 in Galactic cylindrical coordinates:
(R, θ, z) = (7.11+0.08
−18 pc) and (VR, Vθ, Vz) = (33±16, 233±11, 11±2)
km s−1, respectively. Additionally, from our VLBA observations we measured the relative
proper motions among the water maser spots located in the central region of the nebula,
which have been proposed to be tracing a toroidal structure. The distribution and relative
proper motions of the masers, compared with previous reported observed epochs, suggest

velocity winds and the expansion of the ionization front in the nebula.

Introduction

Determining the distance to astronomical sources represents one of the most challenging tasks
in modern astronomy. The measurements become more difﬁcult in the cases where there is no stan-
dard candle or ruler that establishes a direct relationship between an observable parameter and the
distance. This is the situation of planetary nebulae (PNe) for which our knowledge on the distance
still remains poor. The distance is a crucial parameter for studying the physical conditions and evolu-
tion of PNe. Furthermore, it also provides information on the location and velocity of these objects
within the Galaxy, which indicate the stellar population to which PNe belong and their kinematical
history in the Galaxy (see e.g. Imai et al. 2007). However, until now, the distances to less than 50 PNe
have been estimated individually with a reasonable accuracy (e.g. Guzm´an et al. 2009 and references
therein). While most of those measurements were performed through indirect methods that are based
on assumptions that cannot hold true in all cases, only about one third of them have been obtained
by a direct method: trigonometric parallax of the central star. This method demands very precise
astrometry (of the order of milliarcsecs) of a source at several epochs, resulting in a very arduous
task. Fortunately, in recent years the techniques of VLBI in radio astronomy have been improved in
such a way that, by carrying out careful astrometric observations, we can measure the trigonometric
parallax, and subsequently the distance to the cosmic objects with great accuracy (e.g. Imai et al.
2007; Loinard et al. 2007, Nakagawa et al. 2008; Reid et al. 2009; Moellenbrock et al. 2009, Sato
et al. 2010). An important constraint on these observations is that the sources must exhibit emission
with high surface brightness. This requirement is met by the maser emission. Therefore, we can
accurately determine the distance to PNe that present this type of emission by observing the masers in
their envelopes. Moreover, these observations can be used as a powerful tool to study the kinematics
of the circumstellar gas in water maser emitting PNe at very small scale.

K 3−35 is the ﬁrst PN for which the association with water maser emission was discovered
(Miranda et al. 2001). Since then, surveys of water masers toward very young PNe have been carried
out, aiming to ﬁnd more sources of the same type. As a result, two additional PNe have been found
to be harboring water molecules: IRAS 17347-3139 (de Gregorio-Monsalvo et al. 2004) and IRAS
18061-2505 (G´omez et al. 2008). These three sources are characterized by showing bipolar lobes
and a narrow and obscured equatorial band, as seen in the optical and infrared images (Miranda et
al. 1998; Sahai et al. 2007). Thus, it has been suggested that a bipolar wind and a high density
equatorial torus could be present in these PNe (G´omez et al. 2008; Tafoya et al. 2009), similarly to
those observed in their progenitors, the pre-planetary nebulae. The presence of dust and high density

2

gas could explain why the water maser molecules remain in the nebula even when the central star is
already emitting a large amount of ionizing photons (Tafoya et al. 2007).

Miranda et al. (2001) observed the water masers in K 3−35 with the Very Large Array (VLA)
and found that they are located in the central region of the nebula as well as at the tips of the two
point-symmetric radio lobes of the nebula. The masers at the tips of the radio lobes resemble those
of the so-called water fountain nebulae (Imai et al. 2002; Claussen et al. 2009), and they seem to be
associated with a bipolar, precessing wind. On the other hand, the masers in the central region appear
distributed along the equatorial, dark band, suggesting that they are associated with an equatorial
torus. This idea has been considered by Uscanga et al. (2008), who modeled the central masers of
K 3−35 as arising from a rotating-expanding ring-like structure. However, detailed measurements of
the internal motion of these masers are necessary to better understand the kinematics of the different
structures in this nebula.

In order to determine with higher accuracy the distance to the young planetary nebula K 3−35,
and to measure the proper and internal motions of the water masers in the nebula, we carried out multi
epoch VLBI observations. For this purpose, we have used the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry
(VERA) Array of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (Kobayashi et al. 2003) and the
Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) of the NRAO9. The details of the observations are described in
§2. The annual parallax and proper motion measurement of K 3−35, as well as the internal motions
of the masers are presented in §3. In §4 we discuss the results and their implications on the study of
K 3−35.

2. Observations and data reduction

2.1. VERA Observations

The observations of the K 3−35 H2O masers at ∼22 GHz with VERA were carried out during
16 epochs from 2007 October to 2009 August. Table 1 gives a summary of these observations. At
each epoch, the total observation time was about 8 hours, including the scans on K 3−35 and the
fringe phase and position reference source, J192559.6+210626 (hereafter J1925+2106), which is one
of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) sources. Since these two sources are spatially
separated by only 0◦.57 it was possible to use the VERA’s dual-beam system. The telescope ob-
served K 3−35 and J1925+2106 for 8 minutes every 20 minutes; in between, the target maser source
IRAS 19312+1950 and its correspondent reference source were also observed. The astrometric results
for that source are presented by Imai et al. (2010). The signals were digitized in four quantization
levels, and then divided into 16 base-band channels (BBCs) in a digital ﬁlter unit, each of which had
a bandwidth of 16 MHz. One of the BBCs was assigned to the frequency of the H2O maser emission
in K 3−35 while the other 15 BBCs were assigned to the continuum emission from J1925+2106.

tive agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.

The data correlation was made with the Mitaka FX correlator. The accumulation period
of the correlation was set to 1 second. The correlation outputs consisted of 512 and 32 spectral
channels for the H2O maser and reference continuum emission, respectively. A velocity spacing of
0.42 km s−1 was obtained in each spectral channel for the H2O maser emission.

The data reduction was mainly made with the Astronomical Imaging Processing System
(AIPS) package of the NRAO. To achieve a good astrometry, we performed the following proce-
dure. At ﬁrst, we recalculated the delay-tracking solutions for the correlated data using an improved
delay-tracking model. Through the whole data analysis, we adopted the coordinates of the delay-
tracking center: αJ2000 = 19h27m44s.023, δJ2000 = + 21◦30′03′′.44 for K 3−35 and αJ2000 =
19h25m59s.605352, δJ2000 = + 21◦06′26′′.16198 for the position reference source J1925+2106. The
delay-tracking solutions included delay contributions from the atmosphere, which were estimated us-
ing the global positioning system data (Honma et al. 2008). Subsequently, the differences due to
instrumental delays between the two signal paths in the dual beam system were calibrated using dif-
ferential delays, which were measured using artiﬁcial noise signals injected at the same time into
the two receivers. Then, fringe-ﬁtting and self-calibration were performed on the fringe phase and
position reference source data, whose solutions were applied to the maser emission data. Only the
solutions of the BBC with the same frequency as that of the H2O maser emission were used for the
fringe-phase compensation. Finally, the image cubes of the maser source were obtained by visibility
deconvolution through the CLEAN algorithm. A few CLEAN boxes were speciﬁed after trial imag-
ing. This is necessary to avoid false identiﬁcation of maser emission in the phase-referenced dirty
images, which have high-level side lobes due to imperfect phase compensation. The typical rms noise
in the emission-free spectral channel images is given in Table 1.

2.2. VLBA Observations

The VLBA observations were carried out at 3 epochs: 2003 September 24, 2003 November
20, and 2003 December 21. The observation settings were basically the same for the 3 epochs. The
ten antennas of the VLBA were used in all the epochs. K 3−35 was observed during intervals of
40 minutes, alternated with observations of ∼10 minutes on the calibrators J1925+2106, BL Lac and
3C345. The total on-source observation time was ∼6.5 hours. One IF with right circular polarization
was used for our measurements. The bandwidth was 8 MHz centered at 20 km s−1 with respect to
the local standard of rest (LSR). The data was correlated with the VLBA correlator in Socorro, NM,
sampling 256 channels, which resulted in a spectral spacing of 31.25 kHz, corresponding to 0.42
km s−1.

The data reduction was performed using the AIPS package. The amplitude calibration was
made using a priori knowledge of the gains and system temperatures of the system and antennas.
The residual delays were obtained using the source J1925+2106, and the bandpass calibration was
made by using the sources BL Lac and 3C345. After this calibration, we performed fringe-ﬁtting
for the spectral channel with the strongest emission. In this process, the information of the absolute

copied to the rest of the spectral data. The self-calibrated data was deconvolved through the CLEAN
algorithm; the rms noise in a single channel of the ﬁnal data cube was typically ∼5 mJy beam−1.
Subsequently, we proceeded to search for maser emission using the AIPS task SAD with the criteria
of detecting emission above 10 times the noise level. From the candidate maser emission, we selected
only those features that appeared in more than three contiguous spectral channels and found their
positions by ﬁtting a two-dimensional Gaussian model to the brightness distribution. The relative
positional accuracy of the detected maser spots was typically better than 10 µas.

3. Results

Thanks to the dual-beam system of VERA we were able to determine the positions of the
water masers of K 3−35 with respect to the ICRF, which is a quasi-inertial reference frame based
on the radio position of 212 extragalactic sources whose positions are known better than 0.5 mas
(Ma et al. 1998). The absolute position error of maser spots with respect to the reference source
achieved by our VERA observations was <
∼0.1 mas. Therefore, they were suitable to determine the
annual parallax and proper motion of K 3−35. On the other hand, our VLBA observations provided
only the relative positions of the masers with respect to a reference feature. In consequence, we did
not use them for the calculation of the annual parallax and proper motion of K 3−35 as a whole.
However, these observations provided higher sensitivity, allowing us to detect fainter maser features
than those detected with VERA. Thus, the VLBA observations were used to quantify the relative
internal motions of the masers. Following we describe the results of the observations from each array.

3.1. Annual parallax and proper motion of K 3-35

∼0.5 mas with a ∆v <

Table 2 shows the parameters of the water maser spots (i.e. maser emission in each individual
channel map) detected with VERA during 14 epochs of observation. We found maser emission in
the channels corresponding to the range of velocities vLSR ∼20.88 – 23.00 km s−1. The velocity
of these masers corresponds to that of those located in the central region of K 3−35. The masers
associated to the bipolar lobes, found by Miranda et al. (2001), are likely to have disappeared, given
that they were not detected neither by de Gregorio-Monsalvo et al. (2004), nor in our observations.
When the emission from all the epochs is velocity-integrated and mapped, we identify three maser
features, which are deﬁned as groups of maser spots that for a given observation epoch are spatially
separated by <
∼1.3 km s−1. These maser features correspond to physical maser
clumps and they are shown in the left panel of Figure 1, labeled as A, F and H (also see Table 2).
Notice that for the features A and F we have used the same labels as for those detected with the
VLBA, shown in Figure 2. The reason of doing this is that we noticed that the relative positions,
as well as the LSR velocities, of two of the maser features detected with VERA are quite similar to
those of the features labeled as A and F from the VLBA observations. Therefore, it is reasonable
to assume that they are the same maser features. The feature H was detected in two epochs with
VERA but not with the VLBA. Within each feature, the relative positions of the maser spots change
slightly (∼50 µas) from one epoch to another. This can be due to a combination of the uncertainty in
the determination of the position and the turbulent motion of the gas within the masing region. This
variation is signiﬁcant when compared to the parallax (∼250 µas, see below). Therefore, in order to
determine the annual parallax from the maser emission, it is necessary to trace the motion on the sky
of a spot that remains relatively stable in position within the masing cloud and that can be detected
during most of the epochs of observation. It has been found that this requirement is generally met
by the brightest spots, i.e. their positions are better determined and they are not signiﬁcantly affected

by the turbulent motions within the masing region (e.g., Imai 1999). From the three maser features
found in our observations with VERA, the feature F was detected in most of the epochs. Within
this maser feature, there are three spots with velocities at vLSR ∼22.15 km s−1, ∼22.57 km s−1and
∼22.99 km s−1; only the one at vLSR ∼22.57 km s−1was detected at sufﬁcient number of epochs to
be used for the parallax and proper motion measurements.

The motion on the sky of the maser spot at vLSR ∼22.57 km s−1 (m22.57) was modeled as
a combination of a linear proper motion and the sinusoidal component due to the annual motion
of the Earth. Thus, any other non-linear proper motion was considered to be negligible. In a ﬁrst
approach, we ﬁtted the data from all the observation epochs. We noticed that some data points showed
a signiﬁcant offset from the model, as compared to the rest of the observations. We also noticed that
the same offsets were found in the data of the source IRAS 19312+1950 (see §2.1). This source was
observed during the same observation runs as K 3−35 and the results of the observations are presented
by Imai et al. (2010). Since these two sources and their corresponding calibrators are different and
independent from each other, we concluded that the observed offsets of some data points from the
model must be due to a systematic problem during the observations at those epochs, which could not
be removed during the calibration process. Therefore, we ﬂagged out the points corresponding to the
epochs that showed the systematic offset and performed the ﬁtting again. The last column of Table 1
indicates whether the data was used for the ﬁtting or not; Table 3 shows the parameters of the data
points used in the ﬁtting process.

annual parallax was estimated to be 260±40 µas, which corresponds to a distance to the source of
3.9+0.7

−0.5 kpc.

Note that this result relies on the assumption that we are tracing the motion of the same maser
spot for all the epochs. It is known that the water maser emission of astronomical sources could be
very variable, even on time scales of days. Particularly, the distribution of the masers in K 3−35
seems to have changed signiﬁcantly since their discovery by Miranda et al. (2001). However, we are
conﬁdent that we are tracing the motion of the same maser spot in our VERA observations due to
the following reasons: i) We are using the maser emission from the same velocity channel map for
all the epochs (vLSR ∼22.57 km s−1). ii) The brightness of the maser spot used for the measurement
did not change signiﬁcantly during the observations (see Table 3). iii) If we were not observing the
same maser spot, the position would show sudden jumps as a function of time, instead of the smooth
linear-sinusoidal motion seen in Figure 1; that would be reﬂected as data points that show signiﬁcant
departures from the ﬁtted model. Therefore, even if the maser spot disappeared from one epoch to
another, it would be tracing the same physical maser clump after reappearing. On the other hand,

it is likely that the maser spot experienced non-linear motions during the two years of observations,
slightly departing from the linear-sinusoidal ﬁtted model. However, these departures are considered
within the error bars shown in Figure 1. Thus, our estimation of the distance is not affected.

3.2.

Internal proper motions of the water masers

From our VLBA observations we mapped the maser emission towards the central region of
K 3−35. The maser spots located at the tip of the lobes of K 3−35, as reported by Miranda et al.
(2001), were not detected in our images above a 3–σ noise level. The detected emission appears as
individual maser features spread over an area of ∼20 × 20 mas within a velocity range of vLSR ∼20 –
25 km s−1 and they are labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F and G in Figure 2. The integrated ﬂux density
of the strongest feature was approximately 20 Jy (see inset in left panel of Figure 2). This ﬂux is
higher than those observed by Miranda et al. (2001) and Tafoya et al. (2007) by a factor of ∼10. The
features A, B, E, F and G were detected in the three epochs of observation, while the features C
and D were only detected in two epochs (Table 4). In general the emission from each feature appears
in more than 3 channels (i.e. each maser feature consists of more than 3 maser spots). The relative

position of the spots within a maser feature changes slightly from each other (∼50 µas) at the different
epochs, due to the uncertainty of the position and to the internal turbulent motion of the gas in the
masing region. This variation is signiﬁcant when compared to the internal proper motions (see Table
5). Thus, following the same reasoning as in the case of the VERA observations (see §3.1), we have
used the position of the strongest spot of each feature to determined their relative proper motions.

The spot used for the self-calibration process, which is contained within the feature labeled as
A in Figure 2, was initially chosen as the reference point to derive the relative proper motions of the
other spots. We measured the offsets and then performed a linear least squares ﬁtting as a function
of time. The result gives us the motions of the masers as seen from an observer attached to the
feature A. However, since the absolute proper motion of the feature F was measured from the VERA
observations (see §3.1), we decided to change the frame of reference of the relative proper motions
from the feature A to the feature F by subtracting the corresponding proper motion vector (see Table
5). Subsequently, by adding the the absolute proper motion of the feature F to the the relative proper
motions of the other masers, we determined the absolute proper motions of all the features.

We noticed that the absolute linear proper motion of the feature F measured with VERA
coincides with the axis of the bipolar outﬂow of K 3−35, suggesting that this maser, and the others
as well, could be tracing the motion of the gas in the outﬂow. However, this proper motion is very
similar to that of the source IRAS 19312+1950: µα = −2.61 mas yr−1, µδ = −6.73 mas yr−1 (Imai
et al. 2010). This source is located in the sky very close to K 3−35 (∼2◦) at a very similar distance
from the Sun ∼3.8 kpc). This coincidence indicates that the proper motions of the masers in these
two sources are due to their motion within the Galaxy rather than to internal motions. Furthermore,
in the case of K 3−35, it is reasonable to assume that the magnitude of the internal motions of the
masers projected on the plane of the sky is of the same order as the radial velocity of the masers,
vrad∼5 km s−1 (∼0.3 mas yr−1), assuming a systemic velocity of the source of ∼26 km s−1(Tafoya
et al. 2007). This value is one order of magnitude smaller than the observed proper motions of the

masers. Thus, we conclude that these absolute proper motions are mainly showing the motion of the
whole nebula, which can be approximated as the average of all of them: hµαi = −3.34±0.10 mas yr−1,
hµδi = −5.93±0.07 mas yr−1. More speciﬁcally, this proper motion corresponds to that of a frame
of reference in which the sum of the motions of the masers equals zero. The velocity vectors of the
masers in that frame of reference are shown in the right panel of Figure 2 and the values of the proper
motions are given in Table 5.

4. Discussion

4.1. Distance to K 3−35 and its location in our Galaxy

The distance to K 3−35 has been commonly assumed to be D ∼5 kpc, as estimated from the
distance scale proposed by Zhang (1995). This distance scale is based on the correlation between the
ionized mass, the surface brightness temperature and the radii of the PNe. However, several other val-
ues have been estimated by other authors: Cahn et al. (1992) calibrated the parameters of several PNe
using the values from other PNe, for which the distances are well known, and estimated a distance to
K 3−35 to be D ∼4 kpc. Aaquist (1993) assumed that K 3−35 was associated to the L755 molecular
cloud for which the kinematical distance based on the velocity of the CO is D ∼9 kpc. van de Steene

13

 
& Zijlstra (1995) obtained a distance of 6.38 kpc based on a correlation of the brightness temperature
and size of the planetary nebulae. Phillips (2002) using the same correlation, but based upon nearby
sources, obtained a distance for K 3−35 of 2.08 kpc. Later, Phillips (2004) re-examined his method
and found a distance of 6.56 kpc. Recently, Giammanco et al. (2010) estimated the distance to PNe
by means of extinction measurements; they found a distance to K 3−35, D <1 kpc. This value is
much smaller than the previous ones and the one we present in this work. This could be due to the
fact that Giammanco et al. (2010) based their analysis on the extinction of the Hα emission, which
can be very uncertain for some PNe. This wide variety of values for the distance to K 3−35 shows
how poorly it has been constrained by these methods. It also shows that while the observations that
use some indirect technique to measure the distance to several PNe, in general, provide good statis-
tical results (uncertainty of 50% or less), the distance to individual objects, specially very obscured
young PNe, might suffer from large uncertainties, in some cases by a factor of 2 or more. This results
in a considerable error when determining other parameters of the nebula. From our observations we
have obtained the distance to K 3−35 to be D ∼3.9 kpc with an associated error of 18%. This re-
sult improves the accuracy of the value of the distance to this source and has the advantage of being
based on a direct measurement, without assumptions on the intrinsic parameters, extinction, etc. We
emphasize that this is the ﬁrst time that the distance to a PN is measure through the parallax of the
masers.

In previous works related to K 3−35, such as those of Miranda et al. (2001); Tafoya et al.
(2007); Uscanga et al. (2008); Gomez et al. (2009) in which several parameters of the nebula were
obtained, the adopted distance was 5 kpc. Our result improves the estimation of the distance to a value
that is a factor of ∼0.75 smaller than the value used by those authors. In consequence, it is necessary
to introduce a correction factor of 0.75 for the values of those parameters that scale linearly with the
distance, and a factor of ∼0.56, for those that scale as ∝ D2. Then, the masers associated with the
bipolar ionized lobes, detected by Miranda et al. (2001), are located at ∼3,800 AU from the center of
the nebula, which is also the extent of the ionized lobes. The projected distance to the masers located
near the central region of the nebula is only ∼65 AU. In general the time-scales depend linearly with
the distance, which means that they should be shorter by a factor of 0.75 and that K 3−35 did not
enter its PN phase until 1988. This result can explain why there was no He+ emission from K 3−35
in 1986 (see Miranda et al. 2001 and references therein). On the other hand, the molecular mass
of K 3−35 estimated by Tafoya et al. (2007) would change from 0.017M⊙ to ∼0.01M⊙, and the
Zeeman pair found by G´omez et al. (2009) would be located at around 110 AU, instead of 150 AU,
from the central star.

Given our result on the parallax, it follows that K 3−35 is located at a distance of 3.9+0.7

−0.5 kpc
in the direction with Galactic longitude l ∼56◦, located 140+25
−18 pc over the Galactic plane, as observed
from our Solar System. On the other hand, if we assume that the distance from the Sun to the center
of our Galaxy is R⊙ = 8.5 kpc (Dehen & Binney 1998), the galactocentric cylindrical coordinates of
K 3−35 are: (R, θ, z) = (7.11+0.08
−18 pc). Furthermore, we can estimate the motion

−0.06 kpc, 27±5◦, 140+25

14

of K 3−35 within our Galaxy by using our approximation of the proper motion discussed in §3.2.
First, we use again the assumption that the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center is R⊙ = 8.5
kpc; we also assume a Galactic rotation speed in the Solar circle, Θ⊙ = 220 km s−1, and a solar motion
with respect to the Local Standard of Rest (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙) = (11.1, 12.24, 7.25) km s−1 (Sch¨onrich et
al. 2010). Then, by following the formulae presented by Johnson & Soderblom (1987), we obtain a
velocity vector for K 3−35, (VR, Vθ, Vz) = (33±16, 233±11, 11±2) km s−1, with VR positive in the
direction of the Galactic center. If we consider a ﬂat rotation curve of the Galaxy, then the velocity of
the Local Standard of Rest of K 3−35 is ΘK3−35∼220 km s−1and the modulus of the deviation from
circular motion is ∼37±14 km s−1.

The derived values for the distance, height over the Galactic plane and peculiar motion of
K 3−35 are similar to those found by Imai et al. (2010) for the water maser emitting post-AGB star
IRAS 19312+1950, which lies only 2 degrees away from K 3−35. This suggests that they might be
tracing a similar population of stars, i.e. relatively high-mass (M⋆ >1.5M⊙) evolved stars, located in
the Galactic Thin Disk, and whose dynamical age, estimated from their velocity dispersion, is <
∼1 Gyr
(e. g. Soubrian et al. 2003). This would be in agreement with the idea that bipolar PN evolved from
progenitors with relatively higher mass than the average PN (Corradi et al. 1995). However, to further
understand the distribution and kinematics of evolved stars within our Galaxy, more measurements
toward this type of stars, similar to those presented in this work, are required.

4.2. The masers in the equatorial region

As previously mentioned, Miranda et al. (2001) found maser emission toward three regions in
K 3−35. The maser emission at the tips of the lobes was suggested to be associated with a bipolar
wind while the central masers were thought to be tracing an equatorial toroid. Uscanga et al.(2008)
modeled the kinematical distribution of the water masers in the central region of this source using
their radial velocity component. These authors found that the ﬁeld of the radial velocity of the maser
emission could be ﬁtted by a model of a rotating and expanding ring-like structure tilted 55◦ with
respect to the plane of the sky and with a position angle of 158◦. The expansion and rotation velocity
of this ring is 1.4 km s−1and 3.1 km s−1, respectively. To try to test this model, we calculated and
plotted the expected proper motions of the masers on the plane of the sky and compare them with
those from our observations. Since we do not know exactly the velocity of the masers with respect to
the central star, we plotted the proper motions of the masers with respect the the feature F . Then, we
changed the frame of reference of the model to the maser with the same radial velocity as that of the
feature F . According to the model, the masers would move <
∼1 mas in 4 years, thus, the distribution of
masers is not expected to change signiﬁcantly. Assuming this, we can directly superimpose the masers
and compare the velocity ﬁelds. We found that, while the magnitudes of the observed proper motions
are similar to those of the model, the directions do not coincide. This disagreement could be due
the fact that the masers presented by Miranda et al. (2001) could be arising in different maser clouds
from those observed with the VLBA four years later. This idea is supported by the observations toward

15

K 3−35 presented by de Gregorio-Monsalvo et al. (2004). These authors compared the positions of
the water masers from observations carried out in May 2002 to the masers presented by Miranda et
al. (2001) using the peak of the radio continuum as the point of reference. The separation of the
masers between the two epochs implies expansion velocities of the masers larger than 100 km s−1 in
the equatorial region, which results unlikely. This separation can be better explained if we consider
that K 3−35 is a very young planetary nebula whose ionized component is changing rapidly. Since
the water maser emission is arising in the regions where the gas has not been ionized, the separation
would be indicating the expansion of the ionization front, which would have a speed ∼100 km s−1.

5. Summary

We presented the results from observations of the water maser emission toward K 3−35 using
two VLBI arrays: VERA and the VLBA. From the VERA observations we have measured the annual
parallax of this source, yielding for the ﬁrst time a direct measurement of its distance: D ∼3.9 kpc
with an error of ∼18%. The value of the distance is a factor of 0.75 smaller than the previously
assumed value. This provides a correction factor of 0.75 for those parameters that scale linearly
with the distance and a correction factor of 0.56 for those parameters that scale as D2. This implies
that this PN is younger than previously thought. From our measurements of the proper motion and
distance, we also determine the location and kinematics of this source in our Galaxy. From the spatial
distribution and relative internal motions of the masers, we suggest that the central region of K 3−35
is evolving rapidly as expected for a young PN and could be due to the expansion of the ionizing front
and winds.
