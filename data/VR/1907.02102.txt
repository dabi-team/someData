ABSTRACT
We present a novel, real-time algorithm, EVA, for generating virtual
agents with various perceived emotions. Our approach is based
on using Expressive Features of gaze and gait to convey emotions
corresponding to happy, sad, angry, or neutral. We precompute a
data-driven mapping between gaits and their perceived emotions.
EVA uses this gait emotion association at runtime to generate ap-
propriate walking styles in terms of gaits and gaze. Using the EVA
algorithm, we can simulate gaits and gazing behaviors of hundreds
of virtual agents in real-time with known emotional characteristics.
We have evaluated the benefits in different multi-agent VR simula-
tion environments. Our studies suggest that the use of expressive
features corresponding to gait and gaze can considerably increase
the sense of presence in scenarios with multiple virtual agents.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, interest in developing intelligent virtual agents
has increased because of the applications in many areas including
gaming and social VR [19], evacuation simulations [34], therapy
and rehabilitation environments [56], training, etc. These applica-
tions require simulation of virtual agents that have personalities,
moods, emotions and exhibit human-like behaviors. Social robots,
too, require human-like appearance and behaviors to elicit more
empathy from humans interacting with them [54]. In the physical
world, humans communicate emotions and moods using speech,
gestures, and facial expressions. Non-verbal expressions, including
body posture and movements, are also important and used for social

generating virtual agents with various emotions. We com-
pute a novel data-driven gait emotion association and com-
bine them with gazing behaviors to create virtual agents
with different emotions. To simulate gazing, we use expres-
sive features such as direct (Happy, Angry) vs. averted gazing
(Sad) and neck flexion (Sad) vs. extension (Happy). To simu-
late gaits, we use expressive features such as body expansion
(Happy), compact posture (Sad), rapid and increased move-
ments (Angry, Happy), and slow movements (Sad).

interactions. Virtual agents and robots that can communicate using
both verbal and non-verbal channels are, therefore, important for
human-computer and human-robot interactions.

Emotions influence our interactions with the environment and
other agents [6]. The perception of someone’s emotional state helps

to define how we view their personality and how we react to their
actions [46]. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate the emotional
context in the simulation of intelligent virtual agents. In this paper,
we mainly focus on conveying emotions of virtual agents based on
gait and gaze.

Psychology literature refers to the features that are used to com-
municate emotional states through nonverbal movements as Ex-
pressive Features [55]. These features include facial expressions,
body postures, and movements [27]. During walking, an observer
uses the style of walking (i.e., gait) to assist the perception of emo-
tions [57]. Gait features such as the extent of arm swings, the foot
landing force, length of the strides, and erectness of the posture
have been shown to assist in the identification of emotions such
as sadness, anger, happiness, and pride [57]. For example, faster
walking combined with high arm swings is perceived as happy, and
a collapsed upper body with less movement activity is considered
as sad [27].

In addition to gaits, gazing behaviors also affect the perception
and expression of emotions [20]. As one of the critical components
of non-verbal communication [5], gaze increases the plausibility
of embodied conversational agents (ECA) [49]. A direct versus
an averted gaze also changes the perceptions of emotions; direct
gaze is associated with anger, whereas averted gaze is associated
with sadness [3]. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to expressive
features of gait and gaze features.

Main Results: We present two novel contributions:

1) A data-driven metric between gaits and perceived emotions based
on a user study. We chose happy, angry, sad, and neutral emotions
because they are known to persist for a prolonged interval of time
and are more apparent during walking [38]. Using the continuous
space representation of emotions [18, 28, 40, 41], we can combine
these four basic emotions to represent all other emotions of virtual
agents [42, 43]. This gait emotion association can also be used
to predict the perceived emotion of any new input gait with an
accuracy of 70.04%.
2) EVA: A novel, data-driven approach for generating emotions
in virtual agents, EVA, using the expressive features of gait and
gaze (Figure 1). EVA algorithm uses the gait emotion association to
generate gaits corresponding to different emotions. We combine
these gaits with gazing behaviors and create virtual agents that are
perceived as experiencing happy, angry, sad, or neutral emotions.1
We validate our algorithms using standard metrics of co-presence
[21]. The questionnaire measures the level of presence achieved
by a real user immersed in a virtual environment, based on the
emotional state of virtual agents generated using EVA. Our results
indicate that in scenarios with a high number of virtual agents,
expressive features can increase the sense of presence felt by the
users in the virtual environment. Our results also indicate that both
gait and gazing features contribute to the perceptions of emotions
in virtual agents. We observe that EVA simulates virtual agents
with desired emotions with an accuracy of 70.83%, and achieves
100% accuracy in terms of simulating emotion corresponding to
sadness.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present
related work on expressive features and emotions of virtual agents.

In Section 3, we give a brief overview of our virtual agent generation
algorithm and present the details of the gait emotion association.
In Section 4, we present the details of our EVA algorithm, which
uses the expressive features to generate emotions in virtual agents.
We present the details of our user evaluation in Section 5.

2 RELATED WORK
In this section, we give a brief overview of related work on expres-
sive features and emotions of virtual agents.

2.1 Expressive Features of Virtual Agents
Emotional states can be communicated through expressive fea-
tures such as nonverbal movements and gestures, including facial
expressions [55]. Ferstl et al. [19] studied the effect of the manipula-
tion of facial features for trait portrayal in virtual agents. Previous
research has used trajectories to convey dominance [52], approach-
ability [53], group entitativity [8], and personalities [9]. Biometric
data can also be used for predicting the emotions of individuals [66].
In this paper, we focus on the expressive features of gait and gaze
movements. Different methods have been proposed to simulate the
gait and gaze of virtual agents to convey a variety of behaviors in
virtual agents. Narang et al. [44] studied self-recognition in virtual
agents with walking gaits and avatars of real humans. Gaits have
been used to convey friendliness [50] and dominance [51] of virtual
agents. Gazing has been a focus of attention in many VR studies
too [45, 63]. Loth et al. [37] studied how users perceived the gaze
of virtual agents. Bailenson et al. [5] investigated the relationship
between gazing and personal space. In this paper, we combine both
gait and gaze behaviors to convey emotions in virtual agents.

2.2 Emotions of Virtual Agents
Affective computing has been applied to improve the simulation
of many human-like behaviors. Jaques et al. [25] investigated the
design of intelligent agents to promote bonding effectively. Liebold
et al. [32] discuss how humans understand and process emotions
in virtual environments. Lee et al. [31] present an emotion model
for virtual agents that deals with the resolution to ambivalence, in
which two emotions conflict. Pelczer et al. [48] present a method to
evaluate the accuracy of the recognition of expressions of emotions
in virtual agents.

Many approaches have been proposed to simulate emotions in
virtual agents using verbal communication [11, 58], facial expres-
sions [4, 7, 11, 19, 35, 60], gaze [30], gaits [39], and gestures [47].
McHugh et al. [39] studied the role of dynamic body postures on
the perception of emotion in crowded scenes. Clavel et al. [12] eval-
uated how both face and posture modalities affect the perceptions
of emotions in virtual characters. Lance and Marsella [30] used a
generative model of expressive gaze for emotional expression in vir-
tual agents. Many generalized virtual agent modeling frameworks
have been developed (e.g., SmartBody [59]) which model the anima-
tion, navigation, and behavior of virtual agents. Vinayagamoorthy
et al. [64] describe models of individual characters’ emotions and
personalities, models of interpersonal behaviors, and methods for
generating emotions using facial expressions. Liebold et al. [33] ob-
serve that multimodal (e.g., a combination of verbal cues and facial
expression) expressions of emotions yield the highest recognition

Figure 2: Overview: Our virtual agent generation algorithm
consists of two parts: (1) offline computation of gait emotion
association and (2) real-time generation of virtual agents
(EVA) with desired emotional characteristics using expres-
sive features. We obtain emotion labels for a set of motion-
captured gaits with a user study and model the gait emotion
association metric using these labels. At runtime, we take de-
sired emotions for each virtual agent as input and generate
expressive features corresponding to the desired emotions.

rates. Inspired by these approaches, we use a perception study (for
gait features) and psychological characterization (for gaze features)
to simulate emotions of virtual agents.

3 GAIT EMOTION ASSOCIATION METRIC
In this section, we provide an overview of our algorithm for gener-
ating emotions of virtual agents. We also describe the gait emotion
metric. This metric is used at runtime to generate gaits correspond-
ing to different emotions.

3.1 Overview
Our EVA algorithm (Figure 2) consists of two parts: (1) offline
computation of an association between gaits and emotions, and
(2) real-time generation of virtual agents with desired emotional
characteristics using expressive features. We obtain emotion labels
for a set of motion-captured gaits with a user study. We use these
labels and formulate a data-driven association between the gaits and
emotions. We can also use this association to predict the perceived
emotion of any input gaits. At runtime, we take desired emotions
for each virtual agent as inputs and use the gait emotion association
to generate gaits corresponding to the desired emotions. We also
combine our method with a multi-agent navigation algorithm (e.g.,
RVO [61]) for collision-free navigation of the agents in the virtual
environment. We combine gaze features according to the desired
emotion for each virtual agent.

3.2 Gait Dataset
We used a combination of publicly available datasets of walking
gaits to formulate our gait emotion association metric:
• BML [38]: This motion-captured dataset contains 120 different
gaits with four different walking styles 30 subjects (15 male and 15
female).

Figure 3: Gait Visualization: We presented 342 gaits visual-
ized from the viewpoint of a camera situated in front of the
mesh.
• CMU [1]: This motion-captured dataset contains 49 gaits obtained
from subjects walking with different styles.
• EWalk: This dataset contains gaits extracted from 94 RGB videos
using state-of-the-art 3D pose estimation [15].
• Human3.6M [24]: This motion-captured dataset contains 14
gaits acquired by recording the performance of five female and six
male subjects walking.
• ICT [44]: This motion-captured dataset contains 24 gaits obtained
from videos of 24 subjects.
• SIG [65]: This is a synthetic dataset of 41 gaits generated using
local mixtures of autoregressive models.

We visualized each gait using a skeleton mesh (Figure 3). We
rendered the gait visualizations from the viewpoint of a camera
situated in front of the skeleton mesh and generated a total of 342
gait visualizations.

3.3 EVA User Study
To compute our gait emotion association metric, we showed the
342 gait visualizations to participants in a web-based user study.
Based on the participant responses, we obtained emotion labels for
each video.

3.3.1 Experiment Details. We recruited 688 participants (279 fe-
male, 406 male, ¯aдe = 34.8) from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We
presented 10 randomly chosen videos to each participant. After
watching each video, the participant answered whether he/she per-
ceived the gait in the video as happy, angry, sad, or neutral on a
5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.
For each video, we obtained a minimum of 10 participant responses.

3.3.2 Results. We converted the participant responses to an integer
scale from [1, 5], where 1 corresponds to strongly disagree, and 5
corresponds to strongly agree. For each emotion e, we obtained
the mean of all participant responses (r e
i, j ) for each gait Gi in the
datasets:

value closer to 1 indicates that the two variables are positively
correlated and a correlation value closer to −1 indicates that the
two variables are negatively correlated. A correlation value closer
to 0 indicates that two variables are uncorrelated. As expected,
happy and sad are negatively correlated and neutral is uncorrelated
with the other emotions.

3.4 Gait Emotion Association
We used the participant responses to obtain emotion labels for the
gaits in the gait datasets. We obtained the emotion label ei for a
gait Gi as ei = e | r e
i > θ , where θ = 3.5 is an experimentally
determined threshold for emotion perception.

If r e

i < θ for all 4 emotions, then the corresponding gait Gi is not
emotionally expressive and we do not use it for metric computation
(21 gaits). If there are multiple emotions with average participant
responses greater than r e
i > θ , we choose the emotion with the
highest average participant response as the label ei for the gait Gi .
Using these gaits Gi and emotion labels ei , we define a function
GEA(e) that returns a set of gaits Gi for which the emotion label ei
matches with the emotion e as GEA(e) = {Gi |ei = e}. We refer to
this function as our novel gait emotion association metric.

We present the distribution of the gaits and their associated emo-
tions in Figure 4. The smallest emotion category, Neutral, contains
16.35% of the gaits, whereas the largest emotion category, Happy,
contains 32.07%, indicating that our data is equitably distributed
among the four emotion categories.

Figure 5: Prediction of Perceived Emotion: We can use gait
emotion association to predict perceived emotions of any
new gait. Given a new gait, we compute gait features using
psychological characterization [13]. We use an SVM classi-
fier trained using the gait emotion association to classify
these features into one of the four basic emotions with
70.04% accuracy.

3.5 Application: Prediction of Perceived

Emotion

We present an application of our gait emotion association to predict
the perceived emotion given any new gait. This allows us to extend
our gait emotion association to include any new gait by predicting
its perceived emotion value without having to obtain ratings from
participants.

We provide an overview of the application framework in Figure 5.
We use the gait emotion association to train an SVM. Given a
gait, we compute numerical values for its expressive features using
psychological characteristics [13, 26] corresponding to posture and
movement of joints. We use the SVM to classify our computed gait
features into one of the four basic emotions. We extract features
corresponding to both posture and movement modalities because
both are important for the accurate prediction of an individual’s
emotional state [27]. We assume a skeleton with 16 joints. Before
extracting features, we extract frames corresponding to a single
stride from the video, i.e., frames corresponding to consecutive foot
strikes of the same foot (walk cycle). We compute the posture and
movement features at each frame and aggregate them over the walk
cycle.

3.5.1 Posture Features. We use the following posture features:
• Volume: According to Crenn et al. [13], body expansion conveys
positive emotions, whereas a person has a more compact posture
during negative expressions. We model this by a single scalar value
corresponding to the volume occupied by the bounding box around
the human.
• Area: We model body expansion by two scalar values correspond-
ing to the areas of triangles between the hands and the neck and
between the feet and the root joint.
• Distance: Distances of the feet and the hands from the root joint

EVA: Generating Emotional Behavior of Virtual Agents using Expressive Features of Gait and Gaze

can be used to model body expansion (four scalar values of dis-
tances).
• Angle: Head tilt is used to distinguish between happy and sad
emotions [13, 26]. We model this using five scalar values corre-
sponding to the angles: (1) at the neck by the shoulder joints, (2) at
the shoulder joints by the neck and the other shoulder, (3) at the
neck by the vertical direction and the back, and (4) at the neck by
the head and the back.

We also include stride length as a posture feature. Longer stride
lengths convey anger and happiness, and shorter stride lengths
convey sadness and neutrality [26]. Suppose we represent the posi-
tions of the left foot joint jl F oot and the right foot joint jr F oot in
frame t as (cid:174)p(jl F oot , t) and (cid:174)p(jr F oot , t), respectively. Then the stride
length s ∈ R is computed as:
s = max
t ∈1..τ

|| (cid:174)p(jl F oot , t) − (cid:174)p(jr F oot , t)||.

(2)

We represent the posture features at frame t = {1, 2, .., τ } by a
13-dimensional vector Fp,t ∈ R13, where τ is the number of frames
in the walk cycle. Then, we can compute the posture features of
the gait Fp as the average of the posture features at each frame t
combined with the stride length:
t Fp,t
τ

Fp =

∪ s.

(3)

(cid:205)

3.5.2 Movement Features. High arousal emotions such as anger
and happiness are associated with rapid and increased movements,
whereas low arousal emotions such as sadness are associated with
slow movements [10]. We consider the magnitude of the velocity,
acceleration, and movement jerk of the hand, foot, and head joints
and compute the movement features Fm,t ∈ R15 at frame t. For
each of these five joints ji , i = 1, ..., 5, we compute the magnitude of
the first, second, and third derivatives of the position vector (cid:174)p(ji , t)
at frame t.

Since faster gaits are perceived as happy or angry and slower
gaits are considered as sad [26], we also include the time taken
for one walk cycle (дt ∈ R) as a movement feature. We define the
movement features Fm ∈ R16 as the average of Fm,t , t = {1, 2, .., τ }:

Fm =

(cid:205)

t Fm,t
τ

∪ дt .

(4)

We combine posture and movement features and compute the
gait features F as F = Fm ∪ Fp . In the end, we normalize the feature
values to [−1, 1] with −1 and 1 representing the minimum and
maximum values of the feature in the dataset, respectively.

3.5.3 Emotion Classification Accuracy. For each gait Gi in the
dataset, we have computed the gait features Fi and the associated
perceived emotion label ei . Using this gait emotion association,
we train an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel with a one-versus-
rest decision function of shape. For any new gait, we compute the
values of the gait features and use the trained SVM to predict its
perceived emotion. We obtain the accuracy results by performing
10-fold cross-validation on all six datasets (Section 3.2). We compare
the accuracy (Table 2) of our classification algorithm with other
state-of-the-art methods that predict emotions based on gaits:

• Karg et al. [26]: This feature-based classification method uses
PCA to classify gait features related to shoulder, neck, and
thorax angles, stride length, and velocity. This method only

matrix of the joint angles at each frame and uses similar-
ity indices for classification. Their algorithm achieves good
intra-subject accuracy but performs poorly for inter-subject
databases.

• Crenn et al. [13]: This feature-based method uses both pos-
ture and movement features and classifies these features
using SVMs. This method considers only the upper body and
does not model features related to feet joints for classifica-
tion.

• Daoudi et al. [16]: This method uses a manifold of symmetric
positive definite matrices to represent body movement and
classifies them using the nearest neighbors method.

• Crenn et al. [14]: This method is based on the synthesis of
neutral motion from an input motion and uses the residual
between the input and neutral motion for classification.

4 EMOTIONS IN VIRTUAL AGENTS (EVA)
In this section, we provide the details of our EVA algorithm, which
uses the gait emotion association to generate emotions in virtual
agents.

4.1 Notation
We define a gait G as a set of 3D poses P1, P2, ..., Pτ where τ is the
number of frames. The set of 3D positions of each joint Ji is referred
to as the pose of an agent P ∈ R3∗n where n is the number of joints.

4.2 Gait Generation
At runtime, for each agent, we take the desired emotion edes as
input. We use the gait emotion association metric and obtain a set of
gaits GEA(edes ) that correspond to the desired emotion. We choose
one of the gaits Gdes from GEA(edes ) and update the joint positions
of the agent in the virtual world using the joint positions from Gdes .
The selection of Gdes from GEA(edes ) can be made according to
many criteria (such as personality or preferred walking speed). In
our current implementation, we choose the gait randomly.

4.3 Local Navigation using Expressive Features
For navigation, we represent each agent on the 2D ground plane
and compute its collision-free velocity. We use a reciprocal velocity
obstacle-based method, RVO, to generate smooth, stable, collision-
free velocities [61]. RVO is an agent-based approach that computes

(11)

4.5 EVA Algorithm
During runtime, we first compute desired gait Gdes using gait
generation method described in Section 4.2. Next, we compute
collision-free trajectories and update the position of the agents
in the ground plane. We retarget the generated gait Gdes to the
avatar of the virtual agent using Unity’s skeleton retargeting [2]
and update the positions of the agent’s joints in the virtual world
using the joint positions from Gdes . We use the emotion-based
gazing behaviors to update the neck joint’s flexion and rotation
angles. The resultant virtual agents are then rendered to an HMD.

5 USER EVALUATION
In this section, we present the details of our user evaluation con-
ducted to evaluate the benefits of our virtual agent movement
generation algorithm (EVA) with and without gazing behaviors. We
compare its performance with a baseline method.

5.1 Experiment Goals and Expectations
We performed the user evaluation to determine whether or not
significant improvement in the sense of presence can be observed
by a real user immersed in a virtual environment based on the
emotional state of virtual agents computed using EVA. We chose
the sense of presence metric because it has been widely used to
evaluate the quality of a VR experience, and a higher sense of
presence is desirable for most VR applications [21, 45]. We wanted
to demonstrate that our algorithm improves the sense of presence,
thus improving the overall quality of the simulations. We compared
the following three virtual agent generation algorithms:
• Baseline: All virtual agents were simulated with a single neutral
gait. Virtual agents did not perform any gazing behaviors.
• EVA-O: Our novel virtual agent generation algorithm (EVA) with-
out any gazing behaviors. We generate gaits corresponding to the
four emotions: happy, angry, sad, or neutral.
• EVA-G: Our novel virtual agent generation algorithm (EVA) with
emotion-specific gaits along with the gazing behaviors.

controlling the rotations of the neck joint in the skeleton
mesh. Specifically, we control the two degrees of freedoms
associated with (1) neck flexion and extension, and (2) neck
left and right rotation.

a collision-free 2D velocity of an agent given its preferred velocity,
time horizon (tmax ), and current positions and velocities of the all
virtual agents in the environment. In other words, it computes a
velocity that can generate a collision-free trajectory at time tmax .
Based on the chosen gait Gdes for an agent i, we set the preferred
speed of the agent as the speed of the gait Gdes . The speed of the
gait vdes is computed as follows:

4.4 Gaze Behaviors
According to psychology literature, the direction of the gaze affects
the perception of emotions [3]. Direct gazes are associated with
approach-oriented emotions such as anger and averted gazes are
associated with avoidance-oriented emotions such as sadness [3].
Using these observations, we present an emotion-based gaze for-
mulation.

We control a virtual agent’s gaze by controlling the rotations
of the neck joint in the skeleton mesh. Specifically, we control the
angles corresponding to two degrees-of-freedom: (1) neck flexion
and extension and (2) neck left and right rotation. Given the de-
sired emotion edes for a virtual agent i, our goal to compute the
two angles θf l ex and θr ot . We present a visualization of our gaze
control angles in Figure 6. Here, the subscripts i and u represent
the virtual agent and the user respectively, and (x, y, z) represent
the 3D coordinates.
• Happy: According to prior literature, direct gaze and neck exten-
= happy,
sion are associated with happiness [3]. Therefore, for edes
the agent’s neck orientation is computed such that the virtual agent
gazes directly at the user with an upward head tilt. The neck angles
corresponding to edes

= happy are computed as follows:

= θhappy ,
θf l ex
θr ot = anдle( (cid:174)pu − (cid:174)pi , (cid:174)f ),

(6)

(7)

where θhappy is a negative constant value indicating neck extension
and anдle(∗, ∗) represents the angle between two vectors. We use
θhappy

= −5◦ for our validation study.

EVA: Generating Emotional Behavior of Virtual Agents using Expressive Features of Gait and Gaze

Symposium on Applied Perception, September 2019, Barcelona, Spain

Additionally, we also performed an emotion identification task,
where we wanted to estimate the accuracy of our EVA algorithm
in generating characters with the desired perceived emotions.

5.2 Experimental Design
We conducted the study using a within-subjects design. We showed
each participant four scenarios with virtual agents walking in dif-
ferent environments. For each scenario, participants performed
three trials corresponding to the three different virtual agent gen-
eration algorithms. The order of the scenarios and the trials was
counterbalanced. In each of the scenarios, we used a set of male
and female virtual agents. For EVA-O and EVA-G, the virtual agents
were simulated with desired emotions chosen randomly out of the
four categories: Happy, Angry, Sad, and Neutral. For the baseline,
all the agents were simulated using the gaits corresponding to the
Neutral category.

After the four scenarios were completed, the participants per-
formed the emotion identification task. For this task, we generated
eight virtual agents: two agents corresponding to each desired
emotion from Happy, Angry, Sad, and Neutral. We assigned male
and female virtual agents to each emotion in this task as well. We
displayed these virtual agents one-by-one to the participants. Par-
ticipants were asked to classify these agents as Happy, Angry, Sad,
and Neutral.

5.2.1 Procedure. We welcomed the participants and informed them
about the overall process and purpose of the study. We introduced
them to an HTC Vive HMD and informed that it might cause nausea
and slight discomfort. The experiment was approved by Institu-
tional Review Boards and the Office of Human Research Ethics.
Before beginning the experiment, the participants were invited
to read and agree to the approved consent form. They were also
informed that they could opt out of the experiment at any time. Dur-
ing the study, the participants could walk in the tracking space and
look around in the virtual environment by rotating their heads. Par-
ticipants provided optional demographic information about their
gender and age. The study required approximately 20 minutes, and
participants were compensated with a gift card worth $5.

Scenarios. We evaluated the virtual agent generation algo-

5.2.2
rithms in 4 different scenarios (Figure 7):

• Crossing: This scenario had 8 virtual agents crossing a busy

intersection in a city environment.

• Garden: This scenario had 4 virtual agents walking in a

small leisure garden.

• Parking: This scenario consisted of 8 virtual agents walking

in a parking lot near a set of stores.

• Scifi: This scenario consisted of 4 virtual agents walking

inside a fantastical residential pod.

In each of the scenario, we chose characters with low polygon
counts because they provide the capability to simulate a large num-
ber of virtual agents while maintaining the necessary frame rate
for VR. It also avoids the uncanny valley problem [23].

5.2.3 Participants. A total of 30 participants (20 male, 10 female,
¯xaдe = 25.4) from a university took part in the study.

5.2.4 Questions. To test the proposed hypotheses, we used a mod-
ified version of a well-established questionnaire by Garau et al [21].
These questions attempt to assess the various aspects of social pres-
ence [36]. In addition to a subset of the original questions, we asked
a question whether the virtual agents seemed to be experiencing
different emotions. Participants answered the Agree/Disagree type
questions on seven-level Likert items. We ask the following ques-
tions:
Q1, Spatial Presence: I had a sense of being in the same space as the
characters.
Q2, Awareness: The characters seemed to be aware of me.
Q3, Interaction: I felt that I should talk/nod/respond to the charac-
ters.
Q4, Realism: The characters seemed to resemble real people.
Q5, Emotions: The characters seemed to be experiencing different
emotions.

5.3 Results
In this section, we discuss the participants’ responses. We computed
average participant responses for all scenarios (Figure 8). We also
tested the differences between responses for the three algorithms
using the Friedman test. For this test, the simulation algorithm is
the independent variable, and the participant response is the de-
pendent variable. We present the test statistic value χ 2 and the
significance level p in Table 3. We observe significant differences
between the three compared methods for all questions across all
scenarios (except Q1 in Scifi and Garden scenario). We also per-
formed a post hoc analysis using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests.
We applied Bonferroni correction resulting in a significance level
at p < 0.017. We present the significance level (p) for pairwise
comparisons between the three algorithms in Table 5. We observe
significant differences between baseline and EVA-G, indicating that
our method of generating emotions in virtual agents using both gait
and gaze features performs consistently better than the baseline
method. We discuss the results in detail below:
• Spatial Presence: According to the higher averaged responses,
participants experienced a higher sense of being in the same space
as the characters simulated with EVA, as compared to the baseline.
For Garden and Scifi scenarios, we do not observe a significant
difference between the sense of presence felt by the participants
across the three algorithms according to the Friedman test. Because
of the insignificant differences in the Friedman test, post hoc tests
do not apply to these scenarios. For Crossing and Parking scenarios,
where there were more agents, we observe a significant difference

between the responses for different methods in the Friedman test.
The Wilcoxon tests reveal significant differences between the base-
line and EVA-G methods.
• Awareness: Participants felt that the virtual agents were more
aware of them compared to the baseline method as evidenced by the
averaged responses. We observe significant differences between the
responses across all scenarios using the Friedman test. Wilcoxon
tests reveal significant differences in the baseline vs. EVA-G and EVA-
O vs. EVA-G comparisons, highlighting the importance of gazing
behaviors in our algorithm.

• Interaction: Participants felt that they should talk/nod/respond
to the agents if their movement was simulated by EVA as compared
to the baseline as evidenced by the averaged responses. We observe
significant differences between the responses across all scenarios
using the Friedman test. Wilcoxon tests reveal significant differ-
ences for the baseline vs. EVA-G and EVA-O vs. EVA-G comparisons
highlighting the importance of gazing behaviors in our algorithm.
We also observe a significant difference for the baseline vs. EVA-O
comparisons for the Crossing and Garden scenarios, indicating the
importance of gaits in eliciting more response from the users.
• Realism: When EVA simulated the agents, they seemed to re-
semble real people more than when they were simulated by the
baseline algorithm as indicated by the participant responses. We
observe significant differences between the responses across all
scenarios using the Friedman test. Wilcoxon tests reveal significant
differences in the baseline vs. EVA-G, highlighting the importance
of both gait and gazing behaviors in our algorithm.
• Emotions: The agents seemed more likely to be experiencing
different emotions if the EVA algorithm simulated them compared
to the baseline algorithm according to the averaged responses. We
observe significant differences between the responses across all
scenarios using the Friedman test. Wilcoxon tests reveal significant
differences for all the pairwise comparisons (except for EVA-G vs.
EVA comparison in the Garden scenario).

5.4 Benefits of Expressive Features
These results show that expressive features provide the following
benefits:
• for scenarios with a higher number of virtual agents, virtual
agents simulated using expressive features improve the sense of
presence felt by the user,
• expressive features make the virtual agents appear more aware
of the user,
• elicit more response from the users, and
• increase the resemblance of the virtual agents to real people.

for corresponding pairwise comparisons.

5.5 Emotion Identification
For the emotion identification task, the participants identified the
emotions of the virtual agents correctly with an accuracy of 70.83%.
We present the confusion matrix in Table 4. We obtain 100% accu-
racy in simulating virtual agents that are perceived as sad and more
than 50% accuracy for all the emotions. These results indicate that
expressive features provide benefits for the perception of emotions
in virtual agents.

6 CONCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND

FUTURE WORK

We present a data-driven approach for generating emotions in
virtual agents (EVA) using expressive features. We use a novel data-
driven metric between gaits and emotions. We combine these gaits
with gazing behaviors and generate virtual agents that are perceived
as experiencing happy, angry, sad, or neutral emotions. We also
present an application of our gait emotion association to predict
how the real users will perceive the emotions of virtual agents
simulated with any new gait and achieve an accuracy of 70.04%.
We validated our EVA algorithm with user evaluation. Results of
this evaluation indicate that the expressive features can increase
the sense of presence felt by the user in the virtual environment
and make the virtual agents elicit more response from them.

Our approach has some limitations. Our approach only takes
into account expressive features of gait and gaze, and ignore the
impact of other agent characteristics related to appearance or facial
expressions or other non-verbal cues like appearance, voice, pupil
dilation, etc. for the perception of emotion [29]. We conducted the
evaluation in a multi-agent VR environment to measure the contri-
bution of our algorithm in a more interactive and immersive setting.
In the future, we would like to examine the gait emotion associa-
tion metric per agent to strengthen the desired emotion as much
as possible while dampening the others. Furthermore, we limited
this approach to walking activity. In future work, we would like
to extend our approach to other activities. Since previous research
shows that gender is recognizable from gaits [67], we would like to
consider the gender of the virtual agents while generating a gait
for them. We would also like to combine our approach with other
emotional cues and compare it with different algorithms that simu-
late other types of motion styles (e.g., personalities [17]). Finally,
we would like to examine the impact of the context and culture of

the observer on the perception of emotion from bodily expressions
using recent psychological findings [22].
