Abstract

Augmented and/or virtual reality (AR/VR) are emerging as one of the main applications in future

ﬁfth generation (5G) networks. To meet the requirements of lower latency and massive data transmission

in AR/VR applications, a solution with software-deﬁned networking (SDN) architecture is proposed for

5G small cell networks. On this basis, a multi-path cooperative route (MCR) scheme is proposed to

facilitate the AR/VR wireless transmissions in 5G small cell networks, in which the delay of MCR

scheme is analytically studied. Furthermore, a service effective energy optimal (SEEO) algorithm is

developed for AR/VR wireless transmission in 5G small cell networks. Simulation results indicate that

both the delay and service effective energy (SEE) of the proposed MCR scheme outperform the delay

and SEE of the conventional single path route scheme in 5G small cell networks.

I. INTRODUCTION

With the increasing popularity of various smart devices such as smart phones, tablets, Google

Glass, Apple Watch, etc., augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have the potential

to be the next mainstream general computing platform [1]. Based on high-deﬁnition (HD)

video services/applications, VR is able to mimic the real world by creating a virtual world

or by applying various on-spot sensory equipments, such that immersive user experiences can

be supported. In comparison, by augmenting more data information to the real world, AR is

able to enhance the perception of reality in a manner of reality-plus-data. Then, what is the real

difference between VR and AR? For instance, with VR, you can dive and swim with dolphins.

However, with AR, you can watch a dolphin pop out of your book. While VR provides an

immersive environment for the user to interact with that world by a head-mounted display, AR

makes the user see the superimposing content over the real world in mobile devices, such as

laptops and smart phones. Since real-time interactions and ﬂows of massive information are

involved in AR/VR applications, it will bring new challenges to the designs of future networks

[2] for accommodating online AR/VR applications. To be speciﬁc, for future ﬁfth generation (5G)

wireless networks, the applications of AR/VR require innovations in the cloud-based network

architectures [3], with an objective of signiﬁcantly improving the network throughput, delay

performance, wireless capacity, etc.

To support the enormous trafﬁc demands involved in AR/VR applications, there have been

a great number of research activities in 5G network studies [4]–[7]. N. Bhushan et al. [4]

pointed out that the 5G wireless networks could meet the 1000x trafﬁc demands over the

next decade, with additional spectrum availability, densiﬁcation of small-cell deployments, and

growth in backhaul infrastructures. Meanwhile, the massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO)

technique offers huge advantages in terms of energy efﬁciency, spectral efﬁciency, robustness

and reliability [5], which allows for the use of low-cost hardware at both base stations and user

terminals. Moreover, the large available bandwidth at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies

makes mmWave transmission techniques attractive for the future 5G wireless networks [6], [7].

On the other hand, the gigantic data trafﬁcs on the next generation of Internet have also been

investigated [8]–[10]. C. Walravens et al. [8] studied the high-rate, small packet trafﬁc in an

3

Ethernet controller and used a technique called receive descriptor recycling (RDR) to reduce the

small-packet loss by 40%. N. Laoutaris et al. [9] proposed using this already-paid-for off-peak

capacity to perform global delay-tolerant bulk data transfers on the Internet. M. Villari et al.

studied the osmotic computing by moving cloud resources closer to the end users, which is

regarded as a new paradigm for edge/cloud integration [10]. What’s more, some studies have

been investigated for video communications [11], [12], which play a signiﬁcant role in big data

communications. W. Xiang et al. [11] proposed a light ﬁeld (LF)-based 3D cloud telemedicine

system and extend the standard multi-view video coding (MVC) to LF-MVC, which can achieve

a signiﬁcant 23 percent gain in compression ratio over the standard MVC approach. G. Wang

et al. [12] proposed a new LF-MVC prediction structure by extending the inter-view prediction

into a two-directional parallel structure, which can achieve better coding performance and higher

encoding efﬁciency.

To reduce the network latency for high-speed reliable services like AR/VR and surveillance,

usage of different chromatic dispersion compensation methods were discussed to reduce the

transmission delay in ﬁber optical networks [13]. Low-delay rate control algorithms have been

proposed to address the delay problem in [14], [15]. For instance, for the AR applications

considered in [15], low-delay communications of the encoded video over a Bluetooth wireless

personal area network were investigated, by using a combination of the dynamic packetisation

of video slices together with the centralized and predictive rate control. Mobile AR and VR

have been used and studied recently [16]–[19]. A. D. Hartl et al. studied the veriﬁcation of

holograms by using mobile AR, where a re-parametrized user interface is proposed in [16]. The

privacy preservation of cloth try-on was studied in [17], by using mobile AR. In [20], S. Choi

et al. proposed a prediction-based delay compensation system for head mounted display, which

compensated delay up to 53 milliseconds with 1.083 degrees of minimum average error. In [21],

T. Langlotz et al. presented an approach for mitigating the effect of color blending in optical

see-through head-mounted displays, by introducing a real-time radiometric compensation.

Different from conventional video applications, AR/VR applications impose a strict require-

ment on the uplink/downlink transmission delays. Take the 360-degree video (an application

of VR) as an example, the jitter and visual ﬁeld delays, i.e., motion-to-photons (MTP) latency

should be limited within 20 milliseconds. Otherwise, the users will feel dizzy [1]. Therefore,

the transmission delay is one of main challenges for running AR/VR application over future

5G wireless networks. Moreover, few studies have investigated the issue of system energy

4

consumption for the heavy trafﬁc and high-rate transmissions required by AR/VR applications.

Motivated by these gaps, it is important to propose a 5G wireless network solution for reducing

the transmission delays and system energy consumption in AR/VR applications. The main

contributions of this work are summarized in the following.

1) Based on requirements of AR/VR applications, a solution with software-deﬁned network-

ing (SDN) architecture is proposed for future 5G wireless networks, which is able to

signiﬁcantly reduce the network latency.

2) To facilitate the AR/VR data provisioning, a multi-path cooperative route (MCR) scheme

is proposed for fast wireless transmissions from multiple edge data centers (EDCs) to the

desired user. Moreover, the delay model with the MCR scheme is analytically studied. The

lower and upper bounds of MCR delay are further obtained.

3) A service effective energy (SEE) model is proposed to evaluate the energy consumption of

MCR scheme in AR/VR applications. Furthermore, a service effective energy optimization

(SEEO) algorithm is developed for minimizing the SEE in 5G small cell networks.

4) Simulation results indicate that the delay and SEE of MCR scheme are better than the

delay and SEE of conventional single path route scheme for AR/VR applications in 5G

small cell networks.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II, a solution with SDN

architecture is proposed for AR/VR applications in 5G small cell networks, where storage

strategies of AR/VR data are discussed. Section III describes a comprehensive network latency

model. The MCR scheme is proposed and the MCR delay is investigated in Section IV. Moreover,

the lower and upper bounds of MCR delay is derived. The optimization problem of SEE is

formulated in Section V, where a two-step joint optimization algorithm is proposed for AR/VR

applications in 5G small cell networks. Simulation results and discussions are presented in

Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes this paper.

A. Network Model

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider a two-tier heterogeneous cellular network, where multiple small cell base stations

(SBSs) and EDCs are deployed within the coverage of a macro cell base station (MBS). The

MBS and EDCs are connected to the core networks through ﬁber to the cell (FTTC). An SDN

architecture is adopted to support the separation of data and control information in Fig. 1. As

5

the network controller, the SDN controller divides the control information into MBSs and data

information into SBSs and EDCs. MBSs are mainly responsible for the delivery of control

information and routing decisions. The EDCs are data centers deployed at the edge of core

networks, where massive AR/VR data are stored. All EDCs and SBSs, equipped with mmWave

transmission techniques, are parts of the 5G small cell network. Utilizing the mmWave multi-hop

transmission technique, AR/VR data streams can be transferred between EDCs and SBSs.

It is assumed that the MBSs, denoted by ΦM , follow a Poisson Point Process (PPP) with

density λM , the SBSs, denoted by ΦS, follow a PPP with density λS, the user terminals, denoted

by ΦU , follow a PPP with density λU , and the EDCs, denoted by ΦE, follow a PPP with density

λE, respectively in the two-dimension (2-D) plane. The distributions of MBSs, SBSs, EDCs and

user terminals are assumed to be independent of each other. To have a clear focus, only the

coverage of a single MBS is analyzed in this paper. For ease of exposition, the SBSs located

within the coverage of the MBS are denoted as a set

, whose number is expressed as

The set of EDCs located within the coverage of the MBS is denoted as

|U|

For a user terminal with AR/VR trafﬁc demands, a request is ﬁrst sent to an associated

MBS by uplinks. Upon receiving a user’s request, the associated MBS searches EDCs that are

located close to the requesting user. If however, there is an EDC located outside the macro

cell, then the associated MBS sends the request to the MBS to which this EDC belongs,

through the SDN controller. Upon receiving the routing information transmitted from the MBS,

the close-by EDCs transmit AR/VR data to the destination SBS that is located closest to the

requesting user. Finally, the destination SBS delivers the AR/VR data to the requesting user

by mmWave transmission links. In above solution, the SDN architecture is adopted to facilitate

the request/feedback transmissions from users by control information links. Moreover, the big

AR/VR data is promptly transmitted by multiple EDCs to the destination SBS. Utilizing the

buffering scheme of the destination SBS, the jitter of multi-path AR/VR transmission between

EDCs and the destination is minimized. Furthermore, the requirements of AR/VR applications,

e.g. low network latency and massive data transmission, are satisﬁed by this SDN solution in

5G small cell networks.

B. Storage Strategies of AR/VR Data

Consider a library

that consists of

AR/VR video contents. We deﬁne q =

q1, q2, ..., q

as the corresponding popularity distributions of these

K

|K|

|K|
AR/VR video contents that are arranged
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

in a popularity descending order, where qk (k

∈ K

) denotes the popularity of

|K|

the k

th popular AR/VR video content, i.e., the probability that an arbitrary user request is

|K|
and 1 6 k 6

−

for AR/VR video content k. Without loss of generality, the distribution of qk is assumed to be

governed by a Zipf distribution [23],

qk =

β

k−
|K|j=1 j−

,

β

(1)

where β is a positive value that characterizes the skewness of the popularity distribution, and

P

|K|

qk = 1.

|K|

In general, a subset of the

AR/VR video contents are stored in EDCs, whereas the

k=1
P
remaining video contents can be fetched from the remote data centers (RDC). For ease of
exposition, we let x = (xmk ∈ {
: EDCm ∈ M
placement strategy in EDCs, where xmk = 1 means that AR/VR video content k (k
stored at EDC EDCm (EDCm ∈ M
not stored at EDC EDCm. Since the storage capacity at each EDC is limited that cannot store

) denote the AR/VR video content

) is

, k

}

7

all

AR/VR video contents, generally there exist three storage strategies in existing studies.

|K|
1) First in ﬁrst out (FIFO): The contents stored at the EDC form a queue in a chronological

order until the storage capacity is reached. In this way, the content at the head of the queue

has to be removed for accommodating the newly incoming content at the tail of the queue.

2) Least recently used (LRU): The contents are stored at the EDC according to how frequently

they are requested by users recently. In this way, if the storage capacity of EDC is reached,

then the least recently used content will be replaced by the newly incoming content.

3) Popularity-priority: All contents are stored at the EDC in a popularity descending order

until the storage capacity is reached. In this way, the more popular content can be stored

by comparing the popularity of the newly incoming content with that of the least popular

content stored at EDC.

In our considered network model, the popularity-priority strategy is adopted to store the most

popular AR/VR video content data at each EDC. Although the popularity distribution of AR/VR

video contents may vary with time, to maintain cache consistency, we consider in this paper

a relatively static popularity distribution within a given interval. This assumption is valid in

examples including popular short news videos that are updated every 2-3 hours, new movies

that are posted every week, new music videos that are posted about every month.

For ease of analysis, it is assumed that each EDC has the same storage capacity, in which Ψ

(Ψ 6

|K|

) AR/VR video contents of the same size can be stored. Since the popularity-priority

strategy is adopted where each EDC stores the most popular contents independently, it ends up

with that the same Ψ most popular video contents are stored at each EDC, i.e.,

Ψ

IV. AR/VR MULTI-PATH COOPERATIVE TRANSMISSIONS

For AR/VR applications, not only a large network throughput is required for transmitting a

massive data, but also a low system delay is needed to support the user interactions. In traditional

networks the data is transmitted from a source to a destination through a ﬁxed path. In this case,

the maximum network throughput is restricted by the minimum transmission rate of links along

the path. It implies that the total network throughput is constrained by the most congested link

with the minimum transmission rate in the ﬁxed path. Moreover, the system delay is also limited

by the minimum transmission rate in the bottleneck of the ﬁxed path. To solve these issues, a

MCR scheme is proposed to meet the requirements of the massive data transmission and low

system delay for AR/VR applications.

A. Multi-Path Cooperative Route (MCR) Scheme

Considering the ﬂuctuation of wireless channels, it is very difﬁcult to transmit the massive

AR/VR data with the low system delay constraint by a ﬁxed path in 5G small cell networks.

On the other hand, the AR/VR data can be repeatedly stored in multiple EDCs according to the

content popularity. Therefore, the same AR/VR data can be cooperatively transmitted to a user

from adjacent EDCs. The basic multi-path cooperative route scheme is described as follows:

1) EDCs selection: According to the system model, multiple EDCs are located in a macro

cell. When the requested AR/VR data is stored at EDCs, B selected EDCs simultaneously

transmit the same AR/VR data to a destination SBS that is the closest to the requesting

user. In the end, this destination SBS transmits the AR/VR data to the user by mmWave

links.

2) Multi-path transmission strategy: B selected EDCs are incrementally ordered by the av-

erage distance ri, 1 6 i 6 B between the EDC EDCi and the destination SBS. The

EDCp, 1 6 p 6 B, is the selected EDC away from the destination SBS with an average
distance rp. The requested AR/VR data S is divided into B parts with the proportion
S. In

. Moreover, the selected EDC EDCp only need to transmit the data of

1
rp

·

ri

B

Pi=1

B

Pi=1

ri

14

this case, the closer EDC need to transmit the larger AR/VR data and the distant EDC

transmit a smaller amount of AR/VR data.

3) Relay SBSs selection: Based on the system model, SBSs are densely deployed in the

coverage of every MBS. When the maximum transmission distance of SBS with mmWave

transmission techniques is conﬁgured as rmmW , it is assumed that there exist more than

two SBSs in the distance rmmW . In this case, the requested AR/VR data is transmitted

to the destination SBS by wireless relayed SBSs. To minimize the relay delay in SBSs,

the relay route algorithm with the minimum hop number is adopted for the transmission

path between the requested EDC and the destination SBS. Relay SBSs are selected by

the relay routing algorithm with the minimum hop number, e.g., the shortest path based

geographical routing algorithm [29].

B. Delay Theorem of Multi-Path Cooperative Route Scheme

MCR Delay Theorem: When EDCs are deployed in a 5G small cell network, the AR/VR

data stored at B EDCs are simultaneously transmitted to a destination SBS by the MCR scheme.

The system delay of MCR scheme is expressed by

λE are the densities of SBSs and EDCs in the coverage of MBS. In a wireless route between

the EDC and the destination SBS, the wireless transmission is time slotted and one packet

is transmitted in each time slot τmmW . rmmW is the maximum transmission distance of SBSs

receiver, N0 is the noise power spectral density, WmmW is the bandwidth of mmWave links, σ

Proof: According to the MCR scheme, the destination SBS simultaneously receives the AR/VR

data from adjacent EDCs by multi-path wireless routes. Rp is the distance between the destination

SBS and the EDC EDCp. Without loss of generality, the probability density function (PDF) of

the distance Rp is assumed to be governed by [24]

V. SERVICE EFFECTIVE ENERGY OPTIMIZATION

A. Service Effective Energy

For the AR/VR applications, wireless transmissions are premised on the basis of QoS. In this

paper, the QoS is deﬁned by

QoS = 1

D 6 Dmax}
{

,

(33)

where 1

...
{

}

is an indicator function, which equals to 1 when the condition inside the bracket

is satisﬁed and 0 otherwise; Dmax is the maximum delay threshold for AR/VR applications.

On the other hand, a massive amount of wireless trafﬁc generated by AR/VR applications is

transmitted in 5G small cell networks. Hence, the energy consumption is another important metric

for evaluating the performance of the proposed MCR scheme. Considering the requirement of

QoS in AR/VR applications, the service effective energy (SEE) is deﬁned by

ESEE = Esys ·

QoS,

(34)

20

where Esys is the system energy of MCR scheme.

Based on the system model in Fig. 1, the system energy of MCR scheme includes the energy
consumed at MBSs, SBSs and EDCs. Without loss of generality, the energy consumption of
MBSs and SBSs is classiﬁed into the embodied energy, i.e., the energy consumed in the man-

ufacturing process of infrastructure equipments from a life-cycle perspective, and the operation
energy, i.e., the energy consumed for wireless trafﬁc transmissions [30]. The energy consumption

of EDCs is classiﬁed into the embodied energy, the operation energy and the storage energy,
i.e., the energy consumed for video storage at EDCs. As a consequence, the system energy of

MCR scheme is extended as

21

the total number of video contents Ψ is expressed by

is constrained within a maximum threshold Rmax for the optimal SEE. Considering functions

constrained by PM > PS > PU .

To solve the optimal SEE problem in (36), a two-step solution is proposed in this paper. In

Step 1, the required system delay is solved for the AR/VR MCR scheme. In Step 2, the SEE is

optimized for the AR/VR MCR scheme.

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

Based on the proposed system delay model of the MCR scheme, the effect of various system

parameters on the system delay of the MCR scheme will be analyzed and compared by numerical

simulations in this section. In what follows, the default values of system model are illustrated in

Table I. Moreover, the performance of SEEO algorithm is simulated and analyzed in this section.

Fig. 2 shows the ﬁber link delay with respect to the number of video contents considering

different skewness parameters of popularity distributions. When the skewness parameter of

popularity distribution is ﬁxed, the ﬁber link delay decreases with the increase of the number of

video content at EDCs. When the number of video content is ﬁxed, the ﬁber link delay decreases

with the increase of the skewness parameter of popularity distribution.

Fig. 3 depicts the backhaul delay with respect to the density of EDCs considering different

number of cooperative EDCs. When the number of cooperative EDCs is ﬁxed, the backhaul

delay decreases with the increase of the density of EDCs. When the density of EDCs is ﬁxed,

the backhaul delay decreases with the increase of the number of cooperative EDCs.

Fig. 4 illustrates the backhaul delay with respect to the density of EDCs under different

maximum transmission distances of SBSs and EDCs. When the density of EDCs is ﬁxed, the

backhaul delay decreases with the increase of the maximum transmission distances of SBSs and

Fig. 5(b) indicate that the gains in terms of backhaul delay decrease with the increase of the

density of EDCs.

In Fig. 6, the impact of buffer size of SBSs on the backhaul delay with different densities of

EDCs is investigated. When the density of EDCs is ﬁxed, the backhaul delay increases with the

increase of the buffer size of SBSs.

Fig. 7 presents the backhaul delay with respect to the density of SBSs under different maximum

distances between the EDC and the destination SBS. When the maximum distance between

the EDC and the destination SBS is ﬁxed, the backhaul delay increases with the density of

SBSs. When the density of SBSs is ﬁxed, the backhaul delay decreases with the increase of the

maximum distance between the EDC and the destination SBS.

Fig. 8 shows the system energy with respect to the density of EDCs under different numbers of

video contents stored at EDCs. When the number of video contents is ﬁxed, the system energy

increases with the density of EDCs. When the density of EDCs is ﬁxed, the system energy

increases with the increase of the number of video contents stored at EDCs.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The requirement of lower latency and massive data transmission for AR/VR applications

imposes a great challenge on future wireless networks. In this paper a solution based on the

SDN architecture is proposed for facilitating the AR/VR service provisionings in 5G small cell

networks. To meet the requirements of lower delay and massive data transmission in AR/VR

applications, a MCR scheme is proposed with an objective of achieving more efﬁcient AR/VR

wireless transmissions in 5G small cell networks, in which, a theorem on the delay of MCR

scheme is proposed. Furthermore, both the lower and upper bounds of the delay in the MCR

scheme are derived. Since VR technologies enable the user to interact with the virtual world,

VR technologies are more sensitive to the latency compared with AR technologies. The SEEM

algorithm is designed to minimize the network energy consumption while guaranteeing that

the delay is less than a given threshold by adopting the MCR scheme. Therefore, the SEEM

algorithm is relatively more suitable for VR applications than for AR applications. Simulation

results indicate performance gains on both the delay and the SEE of the proposed MCR scheme
