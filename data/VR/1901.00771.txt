1. Introduction

⊂

For many applications in asymptotic geometric analysis, convex geometry or even
optimization it is useful to approximate a given convex body by another one. For
example, the classical Rogers-Shephard inequality [1, Theorem 1.5.2] states that, for
Rn, the volume of the diﬀerence body K
K is “comparable”
a convex body K
with the volume of K. Precisely,
stands for the
n-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Rogers and Shephard also showed, with the
additional assumption that K has barycenter at the origin, that the intersection
body K
n . These
inequalities imply that any given body is enclosed by (or contains) a symmetric
body whose volume is “small” (“large”) enough. In many cases this allows us to
take advantage of the symmetry of the diﬀerence body (or the intersection body)
to conclude something about K.

K) has “large” volume. Namely,

Perhaps the most notable application of these kind of approximations can be
viewed when studying John/L¨owner ellipsoid (maximum/minimum volume ellip-
soid respectively). For example, if the Euclidean ball is the maximal volume ellip-
soid inside K, we can decompose the identity as a linear combination of rank-one
operators deﬁned by contact points [1, Theorem 2.1.10]. This decomposition plays a
key role in the study of distances between bodies, see [33] for a complete treatment
on this. We also refer to [26, 18, 17, 23, 24, 28] for many nice results/applications
which involve these extremal ellipsoids. A natural quantity that relates a given
body K with its ellipsoid of maximal volume is given by the “standard” volume
ratio

Using the Brascamp-Lieb inequality, Ball showed that vr(K) is maximal when K
is a simplex . The extreme case, among all the centrally symmetric convex bodies,
is given by the cube (see [1, Theorem 2.4.8]).

A natural generalization of this ratio is given by the following deﬁnition intro-
duced by Giannopoulos and Hartzoulaki [11] and also studied by Gordon, Litvak,
Meyer and Pajor [13]: given two convex bodies K and L in Rn the volume ratio of
the pair (K, L) is deﬁned as

where the inﬁmum (actually a minimum) is taken over all aﬃne transformations T .
In other words, vr(K, L) measures how well can K be approximated by an aﬃne
image of L. Note that the classic value vr(K) is just vr(K, Bn

Euclidean unit ball in Rn.

Given a convex body K, it is natural to ask how “good” an approximation of this
kind can be (in terms of the dimension of the ambient space). Namely, we want to

Khrabrov (based on the well-known construction due to Gluskin [14] used to
understand the diameter of Minkowski compactum), showed in [19, Theorem 5] the

where c > 0 is an absolute constant. The body L is found using the probabilistic
method (Khrabrov considered a random polytope whose vertices are sampled on
the unit sphere and showed that, with high probability, it veriﬁes Equation (4)).

On the other hand, it is very easy to see that vr(K, L)

Using Chevet’s inequality together with clever positions of K and L, Giannopoulos
and Hartzoulaki [11] were able to prove the following important and stronger result:

Moreover, we show that there are “many” (with high probability) random poly-

lower bound cannot be improved in general.

To obtain Theorem 1.1 we make some important changes in Khravrov’s proof,

which require ﬁner estimates, and use some approximation arguments.

We also deal, for same natural classes of convex bodies, with the upper bounds.
Our results are of probabilistic nature, so we will be interested in obtaining bounds
with high probability.

First we treat the case of the Schatten trace classes, the non-commutative ver-
sion of the classical ℓp sequence spaces. They consist of all compact operators on a
Hilbert space for which the sequence of their singular values belongs to ℓp. Many
diﬀerent properties of them in the ﬁnite dimensional setting have been largely stud-
ied in the area of asymptotic geometric analysis. For example, K¨oning, Meyer and
Pajor [21] established the boundedness of the isotropic constants of the unit balls of

To prove Proposition 3.1 we need a couple of lemmas. The ﬁrst one is a technical
tool which bounds the number of points in an ε-net for an adequate set. This
should be compared with [19, Lemma 5]: note that the set and the metric diﬀer.
This subtle but important modiﬁcation is the key ingredient we need.

Lemma 3.2. Let K

In order to prove Theorem 3.1 we will show that any given convex body can be
approximated by another one which fulﬁls the hypothesis of the previous propo-
sition. To do this we use Klartag’s solution to the isomorphic slicing problem
(which asserts that, given any convex body, we can ﬁnd another convex body, with
absolutely bounded isotropic constant, that is geometrically close to the ﬁrst one).

Theorem 3.5 ([20], Theorem 1.1 ). Let K

As pointed out by A. Giannopoulos and A. Litvak [12], an alternative proof of
the last proposition can be obtained by using the M -position, which seems a more
natural approach.

The M -position was discovered by Milman in relation with the reverse Brunn-
Minkowski inequality. We refer the reader to [1, Chapter 8] for a very nice treatment
on this topic.

4. Upper bounds

We now provide upper estimates for lvr(K) for diﬀerent classes of convex bodies.
Together with this inequalities we derive sharp asymptotic estimates. It should be
mentioned that, to bound vr(K, L), Giannopoulos and Hartzoulaki [17] managed
XL with small norm. To do this,
to ﬁnd randomly a unitary operator T : XK →
they used Chevet’s inequality for an adequate position of L. To our purposes we
will use the following high probability version of the Gaussian Chevet’s inequality
(tail inequality).

Given a convex body W

Rn we need to introduce a position ˜W highly related
with the well-known ℓ-position. It has been introduced by Rudelson in [31] and
its existence can be also tracked in the proof of the main theorem of the paper of
Giannopoulos and Hartzoulaki [11], who used this position together with Chevet’s
inequality to bound the volume ratio.

When a convex body in Rn satisﬁes the previous estimates we say it is in Rudelson

position.

First we will show how Rudelson’s position together with Chevet’s inequality can
be used to bound the largest volume ratio for some natural classes of convex bodies.
Observe that, by Remark 2.1 (3), bounding simultaneously the determinant (from
bellow) and the norm (from above) of an operator gives a bound for the volume
ratio. We will also need the following lower bound for the determinant of a random
Gaussian matrix, which can be found in [29, Corollary 1].

4.2. Tensor products. Another natural class of convex bodies for which we can
obtain sharp asymptotic bounds for the largest volume ratio are the unit balls of

In order to do prove Theorem 1.3, we need to have estimates of some geometrical
parameters of the involved spaces. Defant and Prengel [8] obtained asymptotic
estimates for many of them. We summarize their results in the next proposition.

All the proofs can be found in [8]. The comparison between the full and sym-
metric tensor products follows from [8, Proposition 3.1]. The estimates (1) and (2)

Recall the following result of Bobkov and Nazarov [6, Proposition 2.4 and Propo-
sition 2.5] (see also [25] or [5, Proposition 4.2.4]), which asserts that the normalized
