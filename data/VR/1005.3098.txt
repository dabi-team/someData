Abstract Optical spectra of the peculiar supergiant 3 Pup taken in 1997–2008 are used
to study the spectral peculiarities and velocity ﬁeld in its atmosphere. The proﬁles
of strong FeII lines and of the lines of other ions have a speciﬁc shape: the wings
are raised by emissions, whereas the core is sharpened by a depression. The latter
feature becomes more pronounced with the increasing line strength, and the increas-
ing wavelength. Line proﬁles are variable: the magnitude and sign of the absorption
asymmetry, and the blue–to–red emission intensity ratios vary from one spectrum to
another. The temporal Vr variations are minimal for the forbidden emissions and sharp
shell cores of the absorption features of FeII(42), and other strong lines of iron-group
ions. Therefore the average velocity for the above lines can be adopted as the systemic
velocity: Vsys = 28.5 ± 0.5 km/s. The weakest photospheric absorptions and photo-
spheric MgII, SiII absorptions exhibit well-deﬁned day-to-day velocity variations of up
to 7 km/s. Quantitative spectral classiﬁcation yields the spectral type of A2.7 ± 0.3 Ib.
The equivalent widths and proﬁles of Hδ and Hγ, and the equivalent width of the
OI 7774 ˚A triplet yield an absolute magnitude estimate of Mv = −5.m5 ± 0.m3, implying
the heliocentric distance of 0.7 kpc.

1. Introduction

The nature of the bright star 3 Pup (HD 62623 = HR 2996 = HIP 37677) has long remained
unclear. In the Bright Star Catalog [1] this star is listed as a A2 Iabe–supergiant. However,
3 Pup was also viewed as an object related to stars evolving towards planetary nebulae with
binary core [2]. The spectroscopic study of Plets et al. [3], who found the star’s atmosphere to
have a close-to-solar chemical composition, provided new evidence for the massive supergiant
nature of 3 Pup. However, the star has a property that is uncharacteristic to massive A-type
supergiants: a circumstellar dust shell. The shell shows up primarily in the form of IR–
excess (3 Pup was identiﬁed with the IR–source IRAS 07418−2850) and speciﬁc two-peaked
emission features in the optical spectrum.

The star’s magnitudes are B = 4.m12 and V = 3.m98, and the color excess E(B–V) = 0.m08 [4].
Its Galactic and equatorial J2000 coordinates are l = 244.◦4, b = –2.◦5 and α = 07h43m48s,
δ = −28◦57′ 17′′, respectively. The recently reﬁned parallax is π = 0.59±0.17 mas [5]. Because

of its high brightness 3 Pup was chosen as one of the several hundred stars used as the basis of
Harvard spectral classiﬁcation. However, whereas Cannon [6] assigned to it the same spectral
type A2 pec as to α Cyg (the peculiarity of both stars showed up in the form of too narrow
and weak hydrogen lines, i.e., both stars are supergiants), Maury [7] noticed that 3 Pup has
a somewhat lower temperature and luminosity than α Cyg, A2–A3 and Ib–II, respectively,
in the currently adopted notation.

Merrill [8] found some emission lines in the spectrum of 3 Pup: a double Hα line with a rel-
atively stronger red component (a P Cyg III type proﬁle according to Beals [9]), [OI] 1F 6300,
6364 ˚A, FeII(40) 6433, 6516 ˚A. He also suspected the presence of emission features in some
other FeII lines. Emission features in the proﬁles of Hβ, Hγ [10] and NaI(1) doublet [3]
were noticed only 60 years later. The known infrared emission features include the strong
CaII (2) 8498, 8542, 8562 ˚A triplet [11], and the [CaII] 1F 7291, 7324 ˚A doublet [12] (these
lines were erroneously attributed to [OII]). As for absorption lines, the eye estimates of their
intensities in the 3120–6565 ˚A wavelength interval [13, 14] conﬁrmed a lower excitation tem-
perature of 3 Pup, compared to that of αCyg, as it followed from classiﬁcation of Maury, and
revealed shell signatures in the star’s spectrum. In particular, the MgII (4) and SiII (1,2,3)
absorptions in the spectrum of 3 Pup are weaker than the same absorptions in the spectrum
of α Cyg, whereas the FeII (42) lines are enhanced compared to FeII (37, 38, 49) lines. The
diﬀerences between the spectra of a supergiant and a shell star are readily seen in Plate 22 in
the atlas of Morgan et al. [15], where they are illustrated on the examples of α Cyg (A2 Ia)
and 17 Lep (Ap sh). The temperature of 3 Pup is close to the temperatures of both stars,
but its spectrum is closer to that of 17 Lep by a number of features (the depth of TiII and
FeII lines and the widths of hydrogen lines).

It became clear from the ﬁrst inspection of the available spectra of 3 Pup that it must be
a very promising object for high-resolution spectroscopy: the star is bright and its spectrum
abounds in various, mostly weak, but well-deﬁned features. But however strange it may
appear, its optical and near infrared spectrum has not yet been thoroughly described. This
circumstance led us to include 3 Pup into our list of program stars with circumstellar shells
for a detailed spectroscopic analysis in order to study the expected spectral variability.

2. Observations and reduction of spectra

We obtained the spectra of 3 Pup with the NES echelle spectrograph mounted at the Nasmyth
focus of the 6-meter telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory [16, 17]. Observations
were made with a 2048×2048 CCD and an image slicer [17]. The spectroscopic resolution and
the signal-to-noise ratio are λ/∆λ = 60000 and S/N>100, respectively. To extend the time
interval of observations of 3 Pup, we use the intermediate-resolution spectra that we took in
1997–1998 in the prime focus of the 6-m telescope with the PFES echelle spectrograph [18].
We used a modiﬁed ECHELLE context [19] of the MIDAS package to extract one-dimensional
vectors from the two-dimensional echelle spectra. Cosmicray hits were removed via median
averaging of two successively taken spectra. Wavelength calibration was performed using the
spectra of a hollow-cathode Th-Ar lamp.

In addition to the spectra taken with the NES spectrograph, we used high-resolution
spectra of the star taken with the ESPaDOnS spectrograph [20] of the 4-m CFHT telescope,
and the cs23 spectrograph [21] operating in the coude focus of the 2.7 m telescope of the
McDonald observatory. The latter spectra were reduced using the IRAF software package.
Table 1 lists the dates of all observations, recorded regions of the spectrum, the spectrographs

employed, and the spectral resolution. Table 2 lists the inferred heliocentric radial velocities
Vr.

We used the telluric [OI], O2 , and H2O lines to control and correct the instrumental
matching of the spectra of the star and the hollow-cathode lamp. The last column of Table 1
indicates whether a correction has been applied, and the residual errors for each spectrum.
For a more detailed description of the procedure of radial velocity Vr measurement from
the spectra taken with the NES spectrograph, and the sources of errors, see [22]. The r.m.s.
error of the measured Vr for stars with narrow absorption lines in the spectrum is less than
0.8 km/s (the accuracy of the velocity inferred from a single line).

3. Discussion of the results

3.1. Peculiarity of the optical spectrum of 3 Pup

A comparison of the line proﬁles and parameters in our spectra of 3 Pup, and in the spectra
of the comparison stars obtained with the same spectral resolution showed that the shell
appears not solely in the form of several lines mentioned above. The shell signature grows
gradually both with the line intensity and line wavelength. Figure 1 compares the central
depths of absorption lines in the spectra of 3 Pup and α Cyg (the depth corresponding to
zero residual intensity is assumed to be equal to 100). Whereas MgII and SiII lines at any
intensities and in any part of the optical spectrum are deeper for α Cyg than for 3 Pup, the
TiII and FeII lines of low and intermediate intensity located in the blue part of the spectrum
are deeper for α Cyg, but with the increasing intensity, the depths of these lines in the spectra
of the two stars become closer to each other and the strongest TiII(13) and FeII(42) lines in
the spectrum of 3 Pup are deeper than the corresponding lines in the spectrum of α Cyg. In
the yellow part of the spectrum of 3 Pup, FeII absorptions are anomalously weak (the bottom
left corner of Fig. 1), they are all to a certain extent “raised” by emissions, in some of them
the absorption core of the proﬁle is uplifted to the continuum level. Note that in this case
the MgII and SiII absorptions in the spectrum of 3 Pup are weaker than the corresponding
absorptions in the spectrum of α Cyg both in terms of depths and equivalent widths (which in
the case of MgII 4481 are equal to 0.56 and 0.66 ˚A, respectively), and the equivalent widths of
the TiII (13) doublet are approximately the same in the spectra of both stars. As it is evident
from Fig. 2, the smaller widths of these lines in the spectra of 3 Pup are compensated by their
greater depth. The proﬁles of the TiII (13) and FeII (42) lines have the same shape. In Fig. 3
we compare the proﬁles of FeII lines of diﬀerent intensity in the spectra of 3 Pup and α Cyg
and with the proﬁles of the MgII 4481 line. In α Cyg all lines form near the photosphere, they
are symmetric and diﬀer only in depth. The only true photospheric line in the spectrum of
3 Pup is MgII 4481 A, whereas FeII features exhibit evident contribution of the shell, which
gives the proﬁles their speciﬁc shape: the wings are raised by emissions, whereas the line
core is sharpened. The latter shows up even for absorptions with depths R ≈ 20 and becomes
stronger with increasing line intensity, thereby explaining the upward bends of the symbol
chains in Fig. 1. Pointed cores are also typical for Hβ–H8 Balmer lines, their central depths
are smaller than the corresponding central depths in the spectra of α Cyg.

Emissions in the wings become apparent in high resolution spectra starting at least from
λ ≈ 4300 A. Figure 4 illustrates the variation of the line proﬁle with wavelength: as we move
from the blue part of the spectrum towards its red part, the absorptions gradually give way
to the two-peaked emissions with an intensity gap at the center. The proﬁle of the double

4

Chentsov, Klochkova & Miroshnichenko: Spectral variability of 3 Pup

emission of FeII(40) 6433 ˚A (the upper proﬁle in Fig. 4) repeats in Fig. 5, as compared to the
proﬁles of the CaII(2) 8542 ˚A permitted line and several forbidden lines. In the spectrum of
3 Pup the latter are represented not only by the [OI] 1F and [CaII] 1F doublets mentioned
above, but also by numerous weak [FeII] lines. A comparison of the emission proﬁles provides
important information about the geometry and kinematics of the 3 Pup shell. All forbidden
emissions in the accessible region of the spectrum have equally shaped proﬁles with the same
widths, and yield the same radial velocity within the errors. Permitted emissions diﬀer from
forbidden emissions by greater intensity gradients in the central parts of the proﬁles, they
are appreciably broader (for [OI] 6300 and FeII 6433 ˚A the full widths at the continuum level
are equal to 120 and 140 km/s, respectively) and are often systematically oﬀset with respect
to forbidden emissions (by 4 km/s on December, 25, 2004). The strong forbidden CaII (2)
triplet has rather interesting two-step proﬁles (in Fig. 5 it is represented by the emission
at 8542 A): the narrow double peak is appreciably shifted redward relative to the broader
“pedestal”. The radial velocity of the peak is close to the velocities of forbidden emissions,
whereas that of the lower component of the proﬁle, to the velocities inferred from permitted
emissions.

Line proﬁles vary with time. The most evident spectrum-to-spectrum variations are those
of the magnitude and sign of the asymmetry of absorptions and the blue-to-red emission
intensity ratios. Figure 6 shows these variations for the case of FeII lines and the D1 NaI (1)
line. The latter is less blended with atmospheric water absorptions than D2 line, and its inter-
stellar component shows a better outlined two–component core. The stellar and interstellar
components are easy to separate because of the variability of the former. The diﬀerences
between the proﬁles disappear at the residual intensity of r ≈ 85. Above this level we observe
the stellar NaI line, the shape of its proﬁle and its evolution with time resemble what we see
for the FeII 5363 ˚A line; below this level we observe the interstellar line, which, unlike what
we see in the case of FeII (42) lines, has almost vertical and stable slopes, they merge in the
85> r >15 interval.

3.2. Radial velocity variations

The anomalies of line proﬁles in the spectrum of 3 Pup aﬀect the inferred radial velocities,
which depend on the features and methods used to measure them, thereby making it diﬃcult
to compare our data with the published results of other authors.

The Lick spectrograms of 1908–24 used by Johnson and Neubauer [23] to classify 3 Pup as
a small amplitude spectroscopic binary were obtained on a blue-sensitive emulsion with an
average dispersion of about 20 ˚A/mm and were measured visually. The inferred velocities ap-
pear to refer to the region of the proﬁles of relatively strong lines with maximal photographic
density gradients. The proposed orbital elements (P = 137.d767, K = 3.6 km/s, γ = 25.4 km/s)
have been reproduced for more than 60 years in the catalogs of spectroscopic binaries in-
cluding the most recent such catalog [24]. Swings [13] used panchromatic plates and found
no velocity variations with time or from one group of lines to another. He inferred a mean
radial velocity of Vr ≈ 31 km/s. According to Crespin and Swensson [14], Vr ≈ 27 km/s.

In addition, several radial velocity of 3 Pup have been published that were measured from
high-resolution (up to 100000) spectra, but, unfortunately, the authors did not mention the
measurement method. Loden [25] used CCD echelle spectra taken during ﬁve successive
nights in February, 1991. He used 80 lines in the wavelength interval 3850–4870 ˚A to infer

Chentsov, Klochkova & Miroshnichenko: Spectral variability of 3 Pup

5

an average radial velocity of Vr = 28.7±0.2 km/s (in their more recent paper Loden and
Sundman [26] corrected slightly this result: 29.3±1.0 km/s).

Plets et al. [3] also had ﬁve CCD spectra at their disposal, which were taken from 1986
through 1991 in small, 30–50 ˚A wide, spectral regions between 3920 and 6180 ˚A with 5 to
10 lines in each region. The data for four of the ﬁve dates yield velocities that range from
27.7 to 30.9 km/s, i.e., are close to the result obtained by Loden [25]. However, the above
authors draw diﬀerent conclusions. Loden [25] found neither the variation of velocity with
time nor diﬀerential line shifts beyond the measurement errors. Plets et al. [3] combined the
new Vr value with some of Johnson and Neubauer data [23] to corroborate the spectroscopic
binarity of 3 Pup.

We performed our radial velocity measurements via a mutual wavelength shift so as to
align the direct and reversed images of the line proﬁle. In this way, we can determine the
velocities of individual features of the line proﬁle. The list of lines used to measure the ve-
locities can be found in Table 3. The complete electronic version of this table is available
at www.sao.ru/hq/ssl/3Pup-lines.ps and www.sao.ru/hq/ssl/3Pup/Table3.html. It contains
the results of identiﬁcation of the features; the adopted laboratory wavelengths; residual
intensities “r” (central values for the absorptions and peak values for the emissions), and
the heliocentric radial velocities for the absorption cores or for the whole emissions. Residual
intensities r are rounded here to hundredths (0.01) and radial velocities Vr, to 1 km/s. The
table contains only the data based on high-resolution spectra with the velocities controlled
and corrected by telluric lines. The residual discrepancy of the zero points of the radial veloc-
ity scales for diﬀerent observing dates does not exceed 0.6 km/s if estimated from interstellar
NaI (1) lines.

The top rows of Table 2 give the Vr values for NaI and other interstellar lines and bands.
The uppermost row lists the velocities of the interstellar components of NaI (1) lines as a
whole (i.e., averaged over all our measurements: 33.3±0.2 km/s). Below we list the velocities
of the two components (one under an other) in the cases where both can be discerned.
The short-wavelength component with Vr ≈ 28 km/s is stronger in KI (1) and CaII (1) lines
and the longwave component with Vr ≈ 37 km/s, in NaI (1) lines. Note that the velocities of
diﬀuse interstellar bands (DIB) are determined from diﬀerent sets of these bands because of
the diﬀerent operating wavelengths intervals.

Does the absorption depth correlate with the velocity measured from the same absorption?
Figure 7 shows the Vr(r) curves based on the data from Table 3. The strongest systematic
trend of velocity with depth was observed on December, 25, 2004. For this date the positions
of individual lines are shown on the plot: the weakest FeII, TiII, CrII absorptions (bottom
left), the FeII (42) triplet (top right), and MgII, SiII lines (below the iron-group lines). The
vertical scatter of symbols gives an idea of the accuracy of velocity measurements based on
lines of diﬀerent intensity. For the dates with appreciably smaller velocity diﬀerences than on
December, 25, 2004 we show in Fig. 7 only the generalized Vr(r) curves. The dependencies for
2006 and 2007, which are very close to each other, are shown by a single, almost horizontal
line. We used the Vr(r) curves in the generalization and averaging the radial velocity data
and list the results in Table 2.

Our measurements suggest that the most stable feature is the outer shell of 3 Pup. Velocity
variations with time are minimal, and the velocity values for forbidden emissions and sharp
shell cores of FeII (42) absorptions and other strong iron-group ion lines are close to each
other. The mean velocity averaged over the above lines (rows 9, 10 and 12–14 in Table
2, respectively) can be adopted as the systemic radial velocity for the system as a whole:

6

Chentsov, Klochkova & Miroshnichenko: Spectral variability of 3 Pup

Vsys = 28.5±0.5 km/s, which diﬀers from both likely values of γ = 25.6 and 23.5 km/s implied
by the model proposed by Plets et al. [3].

On the other hand, the weakest photospheric absorptions (r → 1, row 16 in Table 2) show
well deﬁned date-to-date velocity variations amounting to 7 km/s between December, 25,
2004 and December, 26, 2006. As is evident from a comparison of rows 15 and 16 of Table 2,
stronger and photospheric MgII and SiII absorptions show similar velocities and similar
velocity variations with time. The latter fact is immediately apparent even for permitted lines
(row 11 in Table 2), most of which are slightly blueshifted relative to weakening absorptions.
These facts, like the narrowing of forbidden emissions compared to permitted emissions,
are consistent with the interpretation of 3 Pup as a star with an equatorial disk and a
low-mass companion [3]. Our Vr values for photospheric absorptions lie within the limits
imposed by the radial velocity curve based on the data of Johnson and Neubauer [23], but
our fragmentary observations are insuﬁcient for its validation and correction.

The velocities of the absorption cores of the ﬁrst Balmer series lines, except Hα, appear
to be close to the velocities of strong FeII absorptions, i.e., to Vsys. The spectra taken on
December, 25, 2004 and December, 26, 2006 show a small Balmer progress. More conclusive
evidence for the radial gradient of velocity in the shell of 3 Pup is provided by the Hβ
(November, 4, 2008) and Hγ (December, 25, 2004) proﬁles. These proﬁles exhibit not only
the main cores used to infer the velocities Vr listed in Table 2, but also the blueshifted
components with Vr ≈ 0 km/s (see Fig. 8). The extra-atmospheric ultraviolet resonance lines
are shifted with respect to the photospheric lines even more, by (−50 ÷ −60) km/s [10].

3.3. Spectral type and distance

◦

The blue part of the spectrum of 3 Pup, where emission components of the lines are weak,
resembles the corresponding regions in the spectra of A2–3 Ib-type stars, and, in particular,
those of HD 207673 and BD +60
2542 (A2 Ib), HD 210221 (A3 Ib), and HD 13476 (A3 Iab) as
reported by Verdugo et al. [27, 28], who observed it with a resolution which is close to that of
our spectra. Given that the proﬁles of metal lines suﬀer from distortions that increase with
wavelength and line intensity, we performed quantitative classiﬁcation by shallow FeI, FeII,
and TiII absorptions and by the MgI and MgII lines in the 4280–4700 ˚A wavelength interval.
The calibration relations of the equivalent width as a function of spectral type W(Sp) are
based on the equivalent widths of A0–F0-type supergiants from [29]. In addition, we also
compared the ratios of the central depths in the blue parts of the spectra of 3 Pup and
η Leo (A0 Ib), HD 21389 (A0 Ia), α Cyg (A2 Ia), HD 17378 (A5 Ia) determined using NES
spectrograph. We estimated the luminosity class and Mv from the equivalent widths and
proﬁles of Hβ and Hγ (we show the latter for 3 Pup and comparison stars in Fig. 9). We also
estimated the luminosity from the equivalent width of the OI 7774 ˚A triplet (W = 1.42 ˚A,
which corresponds to luminosity class Ib). Our ﬁnal estimates of the spectral type and
absolute magnitude of 3 Pup are A2.7±0.3 Ib and Mv = −5.5 ± 0.3m, respectively.

The trigonometric parallax of 3 Pup, which corresponds to d>1.4 kpc, is too small (about
0.6 mas) and therefore too uncertain. The distance estimates based on the Av(d) dependen-
cies derived by Neckel and Klare [30] and Plets et al. [3] are equally unreliable. They indicate
that interstellar extinction increases slowly with distance towards 3 Pup, and that it reaches
Av(3 Pup)≈ 0.5m at d ≈ 1.4 kpc, whereas both the stellar and nonstellar radial velocities of
3 Pup are observed already at 0.3–0.5 kpc. Currently, the most accurate results for 3 Pup are

Chentsov, Klochkova & Miroshnichenko: Spectral variability of 3 Pup

7

provided by the method of spectroscopic parallax, which yields d ≈ 0.7 kpc for the E(B–V)
and Mv values mentioned above.

4. Conclusions

In the case of FeII lines in the spectrum of 3 Pup there is an evident contribution of the shell,
which gives the proﬁles their speciﬁc shapes: the wings are raised by emissions, whereas the
core is sharpened. The latter is apparent even for the absorptions with depths R ≈ 20 at
λ > 4300˚A and becomes more pronounced with increasing line strength. Sharpened cores
are typical of Balmer lines except for Hα.

The proﬁles of the CaII (2) triplet have a “twostep” shape: a narrow double peak is ap-
preciably redshifted with respect to the relatively broader “pedestal”. The radial velocity
of the peak is close to the velocities of forbidden emission lines, whereas that of the lower
component of the proﬁle is close to the velocities determined from the permitted emissions.
Line proﬁles vary with time: both the magnitude and the sign of the absorption asymmetry,
and the blue–to–red emission intensity ratios vary from one spectrum to another. The proﬁles
of all forbidden emissions in the recorded region of the spectrum have the same shapes and
widths and yield the same radial velocity within the errors.

Radial velocity variations of forbidden emissions and sharp envelope cores of FeII (42)
absorptions and other strong iron-group ion lines are minimal and the velocities of these
lines are close to each other. The mean velocity averaged over the above lines can be adopted
as the radial velocity of the system as a whole: Vsys = 28.5±0.5 km/s.

The weakest photospheric absorptions (with residual intensities r→100) and the photo-
spheric absorptions MgII, SiII exhibit bona ﬁde day-to-day velocity variations amounting to
7 km/s.

Shallow FeI, FeII, and TiII absorptions and MgI, MgII lines in the 4280–4700 ˚A wavelength
interval yield a spectral type of A2.7±0.3 Ib. The equivalent widths and proﬁles of Hδ and
Hγ, and the equivalent width of the OI 7774 ˚A triplet yield an absolute magmnitude of
Mv = −5.5 ± 0.3m.

Chentsov, Klochkova & Miroshnichenko: Spectral variability of 3 Pup

Figure 1. Comparison of the central line depths R in the spectra of 3 Pup (the vertical
axis) and αCyg (the horizontal axis). The open circles correspond to Ti II lines in the 3680–
5190 ˚A wavelength interval; the ﬁlled squares, to the FeII lines in the 3780–5170 ˚A wavelength
interval; the dots, to the FeII lines in the 5990–6520 ˚A wavelength interval, and the triangles,
to the MgII(4) and SiII(1,2,3) lines.

Figure 2. Spectra of αCyg (the thin line at the bottom) and 3 Pup (shifted upward by 20
scale points). The strongest lines are TiII (13) 3759 and 3761 ˚A. The spectrum of 3 Pup at the
borders of the ﬁgure is depressed by the wings of the H12 3750 and H11 3771 ˚A lines. Here
and in the subsequent ﬁgures the relative intensity r = 100 corresponds to the continuum
level.

Figure 7. Dependence of the radial velocity measured from the absorption core on its central
intensity. The dots show individual absorptions of iron-group ions in the spectrum taken on
December 25, 2004 and the solid line shows the Vr(r) curve averaged over these absorptions.
The mean Vr(r) dependencies for the same group of absorptions are shown by: the dotted line
(14.03.03), the dashed line (4.11.2008), and the dash-and-dot line (26.12.06 and 07.02.02).
The MgII and SiII lines are shown by the crosses (the spectrum of December 25, 2004), open
circles (December 26, 2006), and the square (4.11.2008).
