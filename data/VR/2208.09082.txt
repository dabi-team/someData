ABSTRACT

Virtual Reality (VR) users often encounter postural instability, i.e.,
balance issues, which can be a signiﬁcant impediment to universal
usability and accessibility, particularly for those with balance im-
pairments. Prior research has validated imbalance issues, but little
effort has been made to mitigate them. We recruited 39 participants
(with balance impairments: 18, without balance impairments: 21)
to examine the effect of various vibrotactile feedback techniques
on balance in virtual reality, speciﬁcally spatial vibrotactile, static
vibrotactile, rhythmic vibrotactile, and vibrotactile feedback mapped
to the center of pressure (CoP). Participants completed standing vi-
sual exploration and standing reach and grasp tasks. According to
within-subject results, each vibrotactile feedback enhanced balance
in VR signiﬁcantly (p < .001) for those with and without balance
impairments. Spatial and CoP vibrotactile feedback enhanced bal-
ance signiﬁcantly more (p < .001) than other vibrotactile feedback.
This study presents strategies that might be used in future virtual
environments to enhance standing balance and bring VR closer to
universal usage.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over one billion individuals, or 15% of the global population, have
a disability [1]. Virtual reality (VR) is inaccessible to a signiﬁcant
number of individuals with disabilities [2, 23, 24, 28, 51]. Unfortu-
nately, these people are seldomly considered throughout VR research
and development, resulting in experiences that are exclusive and
inaccessible. For instance, individuals with balance impairments
(BI) may not be able to stand during VR encounters comfortably.
This restriction may prohibit consumers from partaking in some por-
tions of the virtual reality experience. VR Head-Mounted Displays
(HMDs) severely destabilize users with BI as well as those without
BI [22, 39, 47]. Nevertheless, minimal research has been performed
to mitigate this effect. If these disparities could be rectiﬁed, people
with and without BI might beneﬁt from consumer VR technologies
more easily.

In the ﬁeld of assistive technology research, multiple feedback
approaches of different modalities [25, 53] have been developed
to enhance real-world balance. For instance, researchers have em-
ployed vibrotactile feedback to enhance the balance of individuals
with impaired eyesight [61]. Also, Mahmud et al. [?] investigated
the effect of vibrotactile feedback in virtual walking. The inﬂuence
of auditory feedback on gait in VR was also investigated in [?].

However, very few studies have been conducted on how vibrotactile
feedback affects balance in VR.

In this study, participants (i.e., persons with and without BI)
attempted to maintain balance while standing in virtual environ-
ments (VE) with different methods of vibrotactile feedback (i.e.,
spatial, static, rhythmic, and vibrotactile feedback based on the
center of pressure (CoP)). This research aims to make immersive
VR more accessible to all individuals. The ﬁndings are intended
to provide future VR developers with an understanding of how vi-
brotactile feedback may be used to enhance VR accessibility. Our
proposed contributions include the following:

• We developed four novel vibrotactile feedback (spatial, static,
rhythmic, CoP) techniques for balance improvement in VR.

• We conducted a study to determine the effects of our vibrotac-

tile feedback techniques on standing balance in VR.

• To improve generalizability, we recruited participants with
balance impairments due to Multiple Sclerosis (MS), who are
rarely considered in VR, and participants without MS.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Imbalance in VR
Although VR systems have great applicability and have increased
in utilization over the years, these systems possess several limiting
factors that make them less accessible and usable for all, especially
for populations with balance impairments (e.g., persons with multi-
ple sclerosis (MS)). One of the primary limitations reported in the
previous literature is that VR experiences can potentially negatively
inﬂuence an individual’s postural control mechanisms [58]. Postu-
ral control and balance are maintained using a variety of sensory
feedback information regulated by the central nervous system [20].
Sensory feedback information is predominately acquired indepen-
dently from visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems to main-
tain stability and balance [19]. Aging and neurological diseases
(e.g., MS) often contribute to the impairment of sensory feedback
systems which can subsequently deteriorate balance and stability in
these individuals [8, 9, 11, 35].

These feedback information systems are particularly important
in VR experiences that utilize HMDs. Particularly, VR HMDs can
disrupt visual feedback and manipulate an individual’s propriocep-
tive feedback systems due to end-to-end latency [40, 57]. Moreover,
balance in immersive VR can be impaired due to the dissimilarity of
tracking space between the virtual environment and the perceived
physical stimulus [40, 42]. Although balance loss in HMD-based
VR experiences has been acknowledged, minimal efforts have been
made to mitigate these issues.

There is considerable research that has investigated the applica-
tion of VR in rehabilitative settings aimed at improving postural
control and gait performance in individuals [6,7,14,18,21,41,43,46].
However, the majority of prior work has often been conducted in
non-immersive VR environments without the use of HMDs. More-
over, most of the previous research on assistive feedback in VR has
been primarily focused on the application of visual feedback [24].

 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, to address these matters, this study investigates the appli-
cation of assistive technology in the form of vibrotactile feedback to
improve balance in immersive VR.

2.2 Vibrotactile Feedback for Balance Improvement in

the Real-World

Previous research has suggested that providing different inputs such
as visual [3], auditory [13], or vibrotactile [54] feedback in real-
world applications can help mitigate instability issues and exces-
sive postural sway experienced by individuals with balance impair-
ments [32, 55, 63]. However, the application of vibrotactile feedback
is often preferred over other assistive feedback modalities because
vibrotactile feedback is thought to interfere minimally with other
senses like seeing or hearing, which can be inhibited by visual or au-
ditory feedback systems [27, 62]. The use of vibrotactile feedback to
improve balance in real-world applications, such as in rehabilitative
scenarios has been investigated in various previous studies.

For example, Kingma et al. recruited 39 participants with an
imbalance from severe bilateral vestibular loss to investigate how
vibrotactile feedback affects balance and mobility in the real world
[37]. Participants wore a tactor (i.e., vibrotactile motor that makes
vibration) belt around the waist for two hours every day for one
month. If they were moving, they were required to wear the belt.
The 12 tactors in the belt were activated via a microprocessor. They
asked participants verbally to rate balance and mobility scores on a
scale of 0 to 10 before and after one month of daily use of the belt.
The average mobility and balance scores increased signiﬁcantly (p
<.00001) compared to without the belt.

Rust et al.

investigated the effect of vibrotactile feedback on
trunk sway for ﬁfteen participants with MS in the real world [50].
Participants wore a headband with eight 150 Hz vibrators which
were positioned at 45-degree intervals. Vibrators were activated
when a sway threshold in the vibrator’s direction was surpassed.
Participants completed a series of training, gait, and balance tasks
in four weeks. The authors measured baseline trunk sway initially.
Then they measured trunk sway with vibrotactile feedback using the
SwayStar system. There was a substantial reduction in trunk sway
(p <.02) than baseline after one and two weeks of training with
vibrotactile feedback. The authors measured a carry-over effect in
the fourth week with no training in the third week. They also found
a signiﬁcant carry-over improvement (p <.02). However, standing
with eyes closed on a foam pad provided the best result with 59%
decreased pitch sway (p <.002) in their study.

Ballardini et al. [4] recruited 24 participants (Male: 11, Female:
13) to investigate the effect of vibrotactile feedback on standing
balance. They created a device that uses two vibration motors po-
sitioned on the anterior and posterior parts of the body to deliver
vibrotactile feedback. An accelerometric measurement encoding
was synchronized with the vibration that combines the location and
acceleration of the body center of mass in the anterior-posterior
direction. The purpose was to compare two alternative encoding
methods: 1) vibration always on and 2) vibration with a dead zone
(i.e., silence when the signal was below the given threshold). Finally,
they tested if the informational quality of the feedback inﬂuenced
these effects by using vibrations unrelated to the real postural oscilla-
tions (sham feedback). Nine participants were tested with vibration
always on, sham feedback, and ﬁfteen with dead zone feedback.
The ﬁndings revealed that synchronized vibrotactile feedback re-
duces sway signiﬁcantly in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral
directions. The two encoding approaches exhibited no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in lowering postural sway. The presence of sham vibration
increased postural sway, emphasizing the relevance of the encoded
information.

While these studies investigated balance in the real world, we
applied vibrotactile feedback in VR to ﬁnd how it affects balance in
VR.

3 METHODS

Our research studied the inﬂuence of several vibrotactile feedback
(spatial, static, rhythmic, and CoP) on balance in VR settings. On the
basis of the past research on assistive technology and VR balance,
we explored the following hypotheses:

H1: Each VR-based vibrotactile feedback (spatial, static, rhyth-
mic, and CoP) will considerably enhance balance compared to the
no vibration in VR condition.

H2: Spatial vibrotactile feedback will improve balance more

effectively than other vibrotactile feedback strategies.

H3: In the absence of vibrotactile feedback in VR, balance will

diminish compared to the baseline (non-VR) condition.

3.1 Participants, Selection Criteria, and Screening Pro-

cedure

To explore the inﬂuence of vibrotactile feedback on VR balance,
we recruited 39 participants (Male:18, Female:21) from the local
area. Six males and twelve females aged 18-75 had BI because of
MS. The other twenty-one participants (Male:11, Female:10) did
not have BI and did not have MS, arthritis, vestibular dysfunction,
or any other medical difﬁculties; however, they were comparable in
age, weight, and height to those with BI. In the BI group, 38.89%
participants identiﬁed as White, 44.44% as Hispanic, 5.56% as
African American, 5.6% as American Indian, and 5.6% identiﬁed
as Asian. 18.18% of those without BI identiﬁed as White, 22.73%
were Hispanic, 50% were African American, 4.55% were American
Indian, and 4.55% were Asian. Table 1 displays the mean (SD)
values for age, height, weight, and gender for both groups (with and
without BI). In our research, more females than men participated.
This is due to the fact that we recruited from the MS community,
which is statistically more frequent in females [1]. Every participant
could walk without support. The participants were recruited from
local MS support organizations, rehabilitation centers, and religious
communities. The authors’ verbal recruitment, email lists, websites,
and ﬂyers were the principal methods of recruitment.

Screening Procedure: First, we conducted phone interviews
with all participants to determine their eligibility for this research.
For instance, we ﬁrst asked them basic questions, such as the year
and date (to measure their cognitive abilities) and demographic infor-
mation. We did not choose anybody who could not comprehend the
questions or lacked English proﬁciency. Then, if known, we inquired
about the reasons for their balance issues. We also conﬁrmed that
individuals were demographically comparable across populations
(i.e., age, height, and weight). Participants who needed medicine
to enhance their balance or who could not stand without help were
eliminated from the research.

3.2 System Description

Vibrotactile Equipment: We used the following vibrotactile

equipment from bHaptics (https://www.bhaptics.com):

Vest: Participants wore a wireless vest that included 40 individu-
ally controllable ERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass) vibrotactile motors.
Twenty of them were on the front side, and the other 20 were on the
backside of the vest. The vest was adjustable with shoulder snap
buttons. The weight of the vest was 3.7 lbs.

Arm Sleeves: Participants wore arm sleeves with adjustable straps
on both forearms, which were placed in between the wrist and elbow.

Each arm piece had six ERM vibrotactile motors. The weight of
each arm piece was 0.66 lbs.

Forehead: We attached it to the HMD to cover around the fore-
head with six ERM vibrotactile motors. It had a weight of 0.18
lbs.

Fig. 1 shows the positioning of the vibrotactile motors.

Figure 1: Vibrotactile motors positions.

Audio-to-Vibrotactile Software: This software converts audio
inputs to corresponding vibrotactile outputs. It also allows for the
control of vibration intensity, which we adjusted to the user comfort
level in our study.

Balance Measurement:

In each condition, the participants’
center of pressure path was measured using the BTrackS Balance
Plate (https://balancetrackingsystems.com). The balance plate’s
sampling frequency was 25 Hz.

Safety Equipment: Participants used a harness to protect them
from falling. A partial weight-bearing suspension system was ﬁtted
to the harness. Kaye Products Inc. supplied both the harness and the
suspension system.

Computers, VR Equipment, and Software: The VEs were
developed using Unity3D. We used the HTC Vive Pro Eye, which
had a resolution of 2160 x 1200 pixels, a refresh rate of 90 Hz, and
a ﬁeld of view of 110 degrees. We used a Vive tracker afﬁxed to
the back of the bHaptics vest to track its position. Vive controllers
were used to tracking hand position and orientation while reaching
and grasping objects. To render the VE and record the data, we
employed a computer with an Intel Core i7 processor (4.20 GHz), 32
GB DDR3 RAM, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card, and
Windows 10 operating system. We collected the BTrackS Balance
Plate data using the NI LabView software (v. 2020) and streamed it
to Unity3D via sockets.

Physical Environment: Our lab environment was temperature-
controlled and had enough open space (> 600 sq ft.). For the
duration of the study, only the participant and the experimenters
were permitted in the lab.

3.3 Study Conditions
We examined four categories of VR-based vibrotactile feedback ap-
proaches and a condition with no vibrotactile feedback to determine
how vibrotactile feedback impacts balance in VR. The audio-to-
vibrotactile component of the bHaptics program translated the audio
into equivalent vibrotactile feedback for each vibrotactile feedback
condition. We utilized white noise instead of music or user-selected
tones to generate audio since white noise has been demonstrated to
alter the signal-to-noise ratio and increase performance owing to the
stochastic resonance phenomena [31].

3.3.1 Spatial Vibrotactile Feedback
To provide spatial vibrotactile feedback, ﬁrst, we utilized Google
resonance audio SDK in Unity for audio spatialization since the
plugin employs head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), and hence
this simulates 3D sound more accurately than Unity’s default [15,44].
The spatial audio in our study was simulated audio (rather than

recorded ambisonic audio). The simulated spatialized audio was
then sent to the audio-to-vibrotactile software, which generated
spatial vibrotactile feedback. The forehead bHaptics device vibrated
at varying levels as the user tilted their head. The vest’s vibration
was modiﬁed depending on its location as detected by the Vive
tracker. The vibration of the arm sleeves was altered based on the
location of the Vive controllers. The X, Y, and Z coordinates of the
3D audio source and the participant in the VE were 0,1,0 and 0,0,0,
respectively, which means the audio source was placed just in front
of the participant.

3.3.2 Static Vibrotactile Feedback

We provided white noise to the bHaptics audio-to-vibrotactile com-
ponent to generate static vibrotactile feedback. The location of the
user had no effect on the feedback. This strategy has also been docu-
mented in non-VR research to enhance the balance of adults [48].

3.3.3 Pitch and stereo pan feedback on Center of Pressure

(CoP)

Similar to static vibrotactile feedback, we transmitted white noise
to bHaptics audio-to-vibrotactile software. However, the pitch and
stereo pan altered depending on the center of pressure path received
from the balance board. We mapped the pitch to the center of
pressure from the x coordinate of the balance plate, and stereo pan
to the center of pressure from the y coordinate in Unity3D [30]. As
a result, when the participant moved from his center position on
the balance board to any other side (e.g., left, right, front, or back),
the participants felt greater vibration as we designed the vibration
intensity to increase with the increase of CoP and vice versa.

3.3.4 Rhythmic Vibrotactle Feedback

At every 1-second interval, we delivered a white noise beat to the
bHaptics audio-to-vibrotactile program to produce the rhythmic
vibrotactile feedback. The duration of the rhythmic audio clip was
also 1-second. Previous research indicated that hearing a constant
rhythm may enhance balance and walking in both persons with
neurological disorders and older adults in non-VR surroundings [26].

3.3.5 No Vibrotactile Feedback

This was utilized to evaluate the balance of participants in VR with
no vibrotactile input. To maintain consistency with earlier circum-
stances, participants continued to wear the HMD, bHaptics suit,
arm sleeves, and forehead part, but no vibrotactile feedback was
provided.

3.4 Study Procedure

Figure 2 shows the whole study procedure.

The research was authorized by the Institutional Review Board
(IRB). Before each user study, we sanitized all equipment (including
the HMD, controllers, balance board, objects, harness, and suspen-
sion system). The participants completed a COVID-19 screening
questionnaire and had their body temperature recorded at the start
of the study. The participant then read and signed an informed con-
sent form. We utilized the participants’ responses to questions on
handedness to ﬁnd out their dominant and non-dominant hands [17].
Then, we explained the whole study procedure. Participants were
then strapped to the harness and suspension system. Throughout the
duration of the trial, the participants were supported by the harness,
stood on the balance board, and wore no footwear.

3.4.1 Pre-Session Questionnaires

The participants completed an Activities-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁ-
dence (ABC) [52] and a Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)
[34] at the beginning of the study.

Figure 3: Participant performing baseline (left) and VR task (right) for
standing visual exploration task.

Figure 2: Study procedure.

3.4.2 Tasks

Participants completed a visual exploration task and a reach and
grasp task while standing. Tasks were performed in both VR settings
and a non-VR environment. VEs were simulations of the actual
settings. To minimize the likelihood of confounding factors, such
as the learning effect, we ensured that both tasks were done in a
counterbalanced sequence.

Standing Visual Exploration Task: At the beginning of each
condition and trial, a prerecorded instruction led participants to gaze
at markers placed in various positions across the room. The markers
had directional designations, and the instruction instructed them
to observe a certain marker each time. There was a two-second
wait between each direction in the instruction. The time was three
minutes in total. In the laboratory, we set several markers — ’Left,’
’Right,’ ’Top,’ ’Bottom,’ and ’Front’ — in their respective directions.
We monitored the head movements and generated pictures of the
participants to conﬁrm they were following the instructions. We
wanted all participants to view the laboratory in a standardized
manner to ensure consistency. During their exploration of the VE,
the participants stood straight on the balance board and were not
permitted to move their bodies except for their heads. We gathered
data in real-time from the BTrackS balance plate. Figure 3 shows the
comparison between baseline and VR tasks for the standing visual
exploration task. The actual environment and associated VE have
been shown in Figure 4. To design the standing visual exploration
task, we reproduced the task provided in [24]. We selected to execute
this motor activity in a laboratory VE because we wanted to compare
their balance in the VE lab to their balance in the actual lab.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: Participants grasped actual items
that were within their reach. We positioned four items (cubes - 5.08
cm) on the table at the designated locations. The distance between
each pair of items was 24 cm. The balance board was positioned
on the ground in the center of the table. The distance between the
table and balance board was 12 cm. Participants were barefoot
and placed each foot on the balance board’s speciﬁed locations.
The participants rested their non-dominant hands on their upper
thighs and reached and grasped the items with their dominant hands.

Figure 4: Standing visual exploration task: real environment (left) and
virtual environment (right).

Participants were permitted to reach the items by leaning forward to
their utmost comfortable distance without taking their heels off the
balancing board and standing upright. The participants were directed
to grasp the four items in a random sequence, lift them to chest level,
and then return them to their original location. To accomplish this
objective, we followed the task in [16]. Fig. 5 depicts the workspace
and a comparison of the actual world and virtual environment for
this activity. We selected this motor task because reaching is an
essential element of daily life, it has been used to test balance, and it
is frequent in VR [10, 33, 59].

environment (C) Virtual environment

3.4.3 Baseline Measurements without VR
The participants stood on a BTrackS Balance Plate while a har-
ness prevented them from falling. Then, we assessed their balance
throughout three trials of standing visual exploration and standing
reach and grasp tasks. Each trial lasted for three minutes.

3.4.4 VR Tasks
All of these are repetitions of the aforementioned baseline activi-
ties, with the exception that they were conducted in VR, resulting
in small changes. For both virtual activities, participants utilized

the HTC Vive HMD to view the virtual environment. We did the
following tasks under four distinct vibrotactile feedback and a VR
condition with no vibration and three times in each session while we
counterbalanced the vibrotactile conditions and tasks.

Standing Visual Exploration Task in VR: To explore the VE,
participants followed the same recorded instructions used for real-
world balance assessments. The same size virtual markers were set
in the same position as the baseline assessment. The measurement
procedure was the same as in the standing visual exploration task
used in the baseline.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task in VR: Using the con-
trollers, participants reached for and grasped virtual items within
their reach with their dominant hand. When participants touched
the virtual items with the controller, the color of the object changed
from blue to red. The participants then pressed the trigger on the
controller to grasp the items, lifted them to chest level, and released
the trigger when returning the item to its original location. The
virtual environment and measures were identical to the baseline task.

3.5 Post-Session Questionnaires

At the end of the study, participants completed an SSQ and a demo-
graphic questionnaire.

Participants required approximately two hours to complete the
study. At the end of the study, each participant was compensated 30
USD per hour and given money for parking.

4 METRICS

4.1 Center of Pressure (CoP) Velocity

In our research, CoP velocity was the key parameter of balance
measurement. We selected CoP velocity because it is generally rec-
ognized as a good measurement for evaluating balance [38]. Using
the following formula by Young et al. [64], we computed CoP from
the four pressure sensors on the BTrackS Balance Plate.

CoP(X,Y ) =

∑4

i=1 Weighti ∗ (xi, yi)
i=1 Weighti

∑4

(1)

Where (xi, yi) = coordinates of the pressure sensor i, Weighti =
weight or pressure data on the ith sensor, and CoP(X,Y ) = coordi-
nates of the CoP.

Then, we computed the CoP path for all samples using the fol-

lowing formula.

CoP Path =

(cid:113)

(CoPi+1X −CoPiX)2 + (CoPi+1Y −CoPiY )2

n−1
∑
i=1

(2)
Here, CoPiX = X coordinate of CoP at ith second, and CoPiy = Y

coordinate of CoP at ith second.

Finally, we calculated CoP velocity by dividing the CoP path for

all samples by the total data recording time for all samples (T).

CoP Velocity =

4.2 Activities-speciﬁc Balance Conﬁdence (ABC) Scale

ABC is a 16-item questionnaire in which each question inquires
about the participant’s conﬁdence in doing a particular daily living
activity [45]. The ABC score is computed by adding the percentages
from each question (1-16), with a maximum score of 1600 possible
points. The ABC percent is calculated by dividing the total by 16.

4.3 Simulator Sickness Questionnaire
The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) is a 16-item ques-
tionnaire in which each question inquires about the physiological
discomfort of the participant [34]. This test is necessary for identi-
fying individuals prone to severe cybersickness and examining the
link with postural instability.

5 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We used the Shapiro-Wilk test to examine the normality of the data.
The data for participants with and without BI were normally dis-
tributed for both tasks; p =.321, w = 0.89. Then, we conducted a
2×6 mixed-model ANOVA with two between-subject factors (par-
ticipants with BI and participants without BI) and six within-subject
factors (six study conditions: baseline, spatial, static, rhythmic, CoP,
and no audio) to identify any signiﬁcant difference in CoP velocities.
When there was a signiﬁcant difference, post-hoc two-tailed t-tests
were performed for comparisons of within and between groups. For
cybersickness analysis, we also used two-tailed t-tests comparing
pre-session and post-session SSQ scores for each participant group.
Additionally, we conducted two-tailed t-tests comparing the ABC
scores of both participant groups to assess the difference in phys-
ical ability. Bonferroni correction was used for all tests involving
multiple comparisons.

6 RESULTS
We compared CoP velocities between study conditions and obtained
the following results.

6.1 Within Group Comparisons on CoP Velocity
ANOVA tests revealed substantial difference for individuals with BI,
F(1,123) = 19.6, p < .001; and effect size, η 2 = 0.08 for standing
visual exploration task and F(1,123) = 51.3, p < .001; and effect
size, η 2 = 0.07 for standing reach and grasp task. We also found
substantial difference for individuals without BI, F(1,123) = 18.02,
p < .001; and effect size, η 2 = 0.06 for standing visual exploration
task and F(1,123) = 41.72, p < .001; and effect size, η 2 = 0.05 for
standing reach and grasp task. Next, for each group separately, we
conducted the following pair-wise comparisons applying two-tailed
t-tests to identify differences between speciﬁc study conditions.

6.1.1 Baseline vs. No Vibrotactile Feedback

Standing Visual Exploration Task: Experiment

results
showed a signiﬁcant difference between no vibrotactile (Mean, M
= 4.44, Standard Deviation, SD = 1.64) and baseline (M= 3.32, SD
= 0.95) condition; t(17) = 3.57, p = .002, r = 0.6 for participants
with BI. Similarly, we observed a signiﬁcant difference between
no vibrotactile (M = 4.33, SD = 1.32) and baseline (M= 3.66, SD
= 1.33) condition; t(20) = 3.28, p = .004, r = 0.76 for participants
without BI.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: We obtained a signiﬁcant
difference between no vibrotactile (M = 6.53, SD = 1.37) and base-
line (M= 5.5, SD = 1.42) condition; t(17) = 3.5, p = .003, r = 0.6 for
participants with BI. We also found a signiﬁcant difference between
no vibrotactile (M = 5.63, SD = 1.17) and baseline (M= 4.98, SD
= 1.07) condition; t(20) = 3.43, p = .003, r = 0.71 for participants
without BI. Thus, we observed a signiﬁcant increase of CoP velocity
in no vibrotactile in VR than the baseline condition in this case.

6.1.2 No Vibrotactile vs. Spatial Vibrotactile Feedback

Standing Visual Exploration Task: For participants with BI,
CoP velocity was signiﬁcantly reduced in the spatial condition (M
= 1.08, SD = 0.64 ) compared to no vibrotactile condition; t(17) =
10.96, p < .001, r = 0.68. For individuals without BI, CoP velocity
was substantially lower in spatial condition (M = 1.32, SD = 1.33)
than in the no vibrotactile condition; t(20) = 10.01, p < .001, r =
0.30.

2.75, SD = 1.36 ) relative to the absence of vibrotactile feedback for
persons without BI; t(20) = 7.29, p < .001, r = 0.72.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: We found that CoP velocity
was considerably reduced in static (M = 4.14, SD = 1.3) contrast to
the absence of vibrotactile feedback in VR; t(17) = 6.31, p < .001, r
= 0.28 for individuals with BI. CoP velocity was also signiﬁcantly
lower in static vibrotactile (M = 3.71, SD = 1.29) compared to the
absence of vibrotactile condition; t(20) = 5.77, p < .001, r = 0.24
for persons without BI. Hence, static vibrotactile outperformed the
no vibrotactile in VR conditions for both tasks.

6.1.5 No Vibrotactile vs. Rhythmic Vibrotactile Feedback

Standing Visual Exploration Task: We noticed that CoP ve-
locity was substantially reduced in rhythmic (M = 2.79, SD = 1.83)
compared to the absence of vibrotactile feedback for individuals
with BI; t(17) = 10.77, p < .001, r = 0.91. CoP velocity was also
considerably reduced in rhythmic vibrotactile (M = 2.55, SD = 1.33)
compared to the absence of vibrotactile feedback for persons without
BI; t(20) = 6.98, p < .001, r = 0.61.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: Experimental results
showed that CoP velocity was substantially diminished in rhyth-
mic (M = 4.04, SD = 1.6) compared to the absence of vibrotactile
feedback in VR for individuals with BI; t(17) = 6.7, p < .001, r =
0.44. CoP velocity was also considerably less in rhythmic vibrotac-
tile (M = 3.58, SD = 1.42 ) relative to the absence of vibrotactile
feedback for persons without BI; t(20) = 5.59, p < .001, r = 0.16.
Therefore, rhythmic vibrotactile performed better than the no vibro-
tactile feedback in VR.

6.1.6 Rhythmic Vibrotactile vs. Spatial Vibrotactile Feed-

back

Standing Visual Exploration Task: CoP velocity was substan-
tially diminished in spatial compared to rhythmic vibrotactile for
both individuals with BI (t(17) = 4.74, p < .001, r = 0.6) and for
individuals without BI (t(20) = 4.09, p < .001, r = 0.30).

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: Experimental results also
revealed that CoP velocity was considerably decreased in spatial
relative to rhythmic vibrotactile for individuals with BI (t(17) = 5.75,
p < .001, r = 0.41) and for individuals without BI (t(20) = 5.52, p <
.001, r = 0.58). Therefore, spatial vibrotactile performed better than
rhythmic vibrotactile to improve balance in our study.

6.1.7 Rhythmic Vibrotactile vs. CoP Vibrotactile Feedback
Standing Visual Exploration Task: CoP velocity was sub-
stantially reduced in CoP vibrotactile than rhythmic vibrotactile
for individuals with BI (t(17) = 4.55, p < .001, r = 0.17) and for
individuals without BI (t(20) = 5.12, p < .001, r = 0.69).

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: We also noticed signif-
icantly lower CoP velocity in CoP vibrotactile than rhythmic for
individuals with BI (t(17) = 4.34, p < .001, r = 0.49) and for indi-
viduals without BI (t(20) = 5.14, p < .001, r = 0.67). These results
suggested that CoP vibrotactile can be preferred over rhythmic vi-
brotactile to reduce imbalance issue in VR.

6.1.8 Rhythmic Vibrotactile vs. Static Vibrotactile Feedback
Standing Visual Exploration Task: The obtained CoP veloc-
ity indicated no signiﬁcant difference between rhythmic and static
vibrotactile for individuals with BI (t(17) = 1.1, p = .288, r = 0.74)
and for individuals without BI (t(20) = 0.99, p = .332, r = 0.77).

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: For individuals with and
without BI, there was no signiﬁcant difference between rhythmic
and static vibrotactile scenarios. For BI, t(17) = 0.43, p = .67, r =
0.77 and for without BI, t(20) = 0.96, p = .344, r = 0.89. Therefore,
there was no clear indication of which vibrotactile feedback could
be chosen between rhythmic and static to improve balance.

Figure 6: CoP velocity comparison between study conditions for
standing visual exploration task.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: For individuals with BI,
the resulting CoP velocity was substantially slower in spatial (M
= 2.01, SD = 0.96 ) than in the absence of vibrotactile condition;
t(17) = 13.66, p < .001, r = 0.32. CoP velocity was substantially
less in spatial (M = 2.18, SD = 0.88) than the absence of vibrotactile
condition for individuals without BI; t(20) = 10.92, p < .001, r =
0.03. Thus, spatial vibrotactile outperformed no vibrotactile in VR
for both standing visual exploration and standing reach and grasp
tasks.

6.1.3 No Vibrotactile vs. CoP Vibrotactile Feedback

Standing Visual Exploration Task: CoP condition (M = 1.17,
SD = 0.91) indicated substantial improvement of balance relative
to the absence of vibrotactile condition; t(17) = 9.84, p < .001, r
= 0.52 for individuals with BI. CoP velocity was also substantially
reduced in CoP vibrotactile (M = 1.48, SD = 0.97 ) contrast to the
absence of vibrotactile feedback in VR; t(20) = 10.38, p < .001, r =
0.44 for persons without BI.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: We observed that CoP
velocity was signiﬁcantly reduced in CoP vibrotactile (M = 2.11,
SD = 1.13) compared to the absence of vibrotactile feedback in VR;
t(17) = 9.91, p < .001, r = 0.13 for individuals with BI. CoP velocity
was also substantially reduced in CoP vibrotactile (M = 2.4, SD =
0.93 ) relative to the absence of vibrotactile feedback in VR; t(20)
= 9.67, p < .001, r = 0.04 for persons without BI. Therefore, the
CoP vibrotactile condition performed signiﬁcantly better than the
no vibrotactile feedback in VR for both tasks.

6.1.4 No Vibrotactile vs. Static Vibrotactile Feedback

Standing Visual Exploration Task: The obtained CoP velocity
was substantially reduced in static (M = 2.47, SD = 1.38 ) compared
to the absence of vibrotactile condition; t(17) = 7.07, p < .001, r
= 0.71 for individuals with BI. Experimental results also revealed
that CoP velocity was considerably less in static vibrotactile (M =

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: Experimental results did
not show a considerable difference between spatial and CoP vibro-
tactile condition for individuals with BI (t(17) = 0.31, p = .756, r
= 0.32) and for individuals without BI (t(20) = 0.96, p = .343, r =
0.38). As a result, it was unclear which vibrotactile feedback could
be chosen between spatial and CoP to solve gait disturbance issues
in VR environments.

Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 represent the experimental results for the
standing visual exploration task and standing reach and grasp task,
respectively. Table 2 represents the summarized results.

6.2 Between Group Comparisons
Results from mixed-model ANOVA and post-hoc two-tailed t-tests
indicated that there was a signiﬁcant difference in CoP velocities for
baseline conditions between the two groups (participants with and
without BI); t(38) = 8.31, p < .001, r = 0.41. However, we did not
observe any signiﬁcant difference between other study conditions.

6.3 ABC Scale
We administered ABC scale to all participants where 80% indicates
high level, 50-80% indicates moderate level, and < 50% indicates
poor level of physical functioning. We performed a two-tailed t-test
between the ABC score of the participants with BI (M = 63.28, SD
= 19.36) and those without BI (M = 93.67, SD = 9.98); t(38) = 4.11,
p < .001. The mean ABC score of the participants with BI was
63.28%, which suggested the participants with BI had a moderate
level of physical functioning. In contrast, the mean ABC score of
the participants without BI was 93.67%, which demonstrated their
high level of physical functioning.

6.4 Simulator Sickness Questionnaire
We conducted a two-tailed t-test comparing the pre-session SSQ
score and the post-session SSQ score for individuals with and with-
out BI. There was no substantial change between the pre-session
and post-session SSQ scores for both participant groups. We found
t(17) = 1.39, p = .07, r = 0.8 for individuals with BI, while t(20) =
1.18, p = .09, r = 0.49 for individuals without BI.

7 DISCUSSION
7.1 Effect of Vibrotactile Feedback on Balance
Balance increases when CoP velocity decreases [49, 60]. Our experi-
mental ﬁndings revealed the following effect of vibrotactile feedback
on balance.

7.1.1 No Vibrotactile in VR vs. All VR Based Vibrotactile

Feedback:

CoP velocity was signiﬁcantly (p < .001) slower throughout all
vibrotactile feedback compared to the no vibration in VR scenario

Figure 7: CoP velocity comparison between study conditions for
standing reach and grasp task.

6.1.9 Static Vibrotactile vs. Spatial Vibrotactile Feedback

Standing Visual Exploration Task: We found that CoP veloc-
ity was substantially less in spatial compared to static vibrotactile
scenario for both individuals with and without BI. For BI, t(17) =
6.01, p < .001, r = 0.76. For without BI, t(20) = 5.69, p < .001, r =
0.55.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: For both individuals with
and without BI, experimental results showed that CoP velocity was
considerably slower in spatial relative to static vibrotactile scenario.
For individuals with BI, t(20) = 8.31, p < .001, r = 0.41. For
individuals without BI, t(20) = 6.48, p < .001, r = 0.56. Thus,
spatial vibrotactile performed better than static in VR to improve
balance.

6.1.10 Static Vibrotactile vs. CoP Vibrotactile Feedback

Standing Visual Exploration Task: For both individuals with
and without BI, experimental results revealed that CoP velocity was
substantially decreased in CoP vibrotactile than static vibrotactile
feedback. For individuals with BI, t(17) = 5.65, p < .001, r = 0.71.
For individuals without BI, t(20) = 6.86, p < .001, r = 0.79.

Standing Reach and Grasp Task: We also observed sunstan-
tial decrease in CoP velocity in CoP vibrotactile condition compared
to static condition for both group of participants. For individuals
with BI, t(17) = 7.26, p < .001, r = 0.43. For individuals without
BI,t(20) = 5.48, p < .001, r = 0.55. Thus, CoP vibrotactile feedback
outperformed static conditions for both tasks.

6.1.11 CoP Vibrotactile vs. Spatial Vibrotactile Feedback

Standing Visual Exploration Task: No substantial difference
was found between spatial and CoP vibrotactile condition for both
individuals with BI (t(17) = 0.55, p = .586, r = 0.77) and individuals
without BI (t(20) = 0.67, p = .506, r = 0.3).

for participants with and without BI for both tasks (standing visual
exploration and standing reach and grasp). Thus, spatial, CoP, rhyth-
mic, and static vibration substantially improved balance for both
participants with and without BI. As a result, H1 can be accepted.
However, the results of this study suggested a divergence from
the past research [24]. They explored the inﬂuence of visual feed-
back on balance using the standing visual exploration task for both
individuals with and without BI in VR. They observed that visual
feedback enhanced balance in individuals with BI but found no
signiﬁcant effects of visual conditions on balance in those without
BI. Interestingly, based on our experimental ﬁndings, vibrotactile
feedback improved balance for both people with and without BI. In
earlier research [5], auditory input was also shown to be more useful
than visual feedback during VR walking.

7.1.2 Comparisons of All VR Based Vibrotactile Feedback:

In all tasks of standing visual exploration and standing reach and
grasp, spatial and CoP vibrotactile feedback performed signiﬁcantly
(p < .001) better than rhythmic and static conditions for individuals
with and without BI which supported our hypothesis H2. There
was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between groups in the spa-
tial and CoP vibrotactile conditions. Also, there was no signiﬁcant
difference between static and rhythmic vibrotactile feedback condi-
tions. This might be due to the fact that both activities tested were
stationary and used a simple VE. A study with more participants
and more complex VEs might ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference between
spatial and CoP or between static and rhythmic conditions.

7.2 Spatial and CoP Vibrotactile Feedback

According to the ﬁndings, spatial and CoP vibration enhanced bal-
ance substantially more than other vibrotactile conditions. When
the participants leaned slightly in either direction while standing on
the balance board or tilted their heads, the spatial and CoP vibration
intensities changed. As these two vibrotactile circumstances worked
substantially better than the other vibrotactile conditions, we hypoth-
esized that the vibration level that varies based on the participant’s
posture gives signiﬁcantly more effective feedback to participants
for adjusting their posture.

7.3 Between Group Comparisons

The ABC scores revealed that the physical functioning of partici-
pants with BI was signiﬁcantly lower than that of people without BI.
The difference in CoP velocities between the two groups’ baseline
conditions was also signiﬁcant. However, there was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference across the remaining VR scenarios. For ad-
ditional analysis, we subtracted baseline data from all conditions
to determine which group had the greatest improvement in balance.
The results of a mixed ANOVA and post-hoc two-tailed t-tests across
the two groups revealed that participants with BI improved their
balance more than those without BI. We hypothesized that since
participants with BI had impaired balance function, they would have
a greater likelihood of improving their balance in VR than people
without BI. This ﬁnding was also supported by previous research in
which it was discovered that people with BI improved their balance
and gait substantially more than those without BI [29]. Because the
individuals with BI improved their balance more than the people
without BI in VR, this could have been one reason why there was
no signiﬁcant difference between the two groups in VR despite a
considerable difference in baseline circumstances. However, more
research is needed to conﬁrm this.

7.4 Effect of Virtual Environment
We discovered that the CoP velocity was signiﬁcantly increased (p ¡
.05) in the no vibration in VR condition compared to the baseline
condition for both standing visual exploration and standing reach
and grasp tasks in both participant groups. As balance diminish

with the increase of CoP velocity, our hypothesis H3 was supported.
Prior studies revealed that postural instability often rises in VR
primarily because of sensory conﬂicts [22, 56], resulting in greater
CoP velocity in VR than in a baseline condition.

7.5 Cybersickness

We did not observe a signiﬁcant difference (p = .35) between the
pre-session and post-session SSQ scores. Participants may have
experienced some cybersickness due to the fact that our research
consisted of two distinct tasks, six distinct conditions for each task,
and three trials for each condition, which took approximately two
hours to complete the study. Cybersickness is frequent in VR ac-
tivities lasting more than 10 minutes [12, 36]. However, since there
was no illusion of self-motion in our VEs, our setting was tailored
to reduce cybersickness. Thus, we expect that cybersickness did not
have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the CoP velocity ﬁndings.

7.6 Limitations

The baseline measurement could be expanded. At the outset of the
study, participants were informed of the whole research protocol.
Then, we conducted several trials with them until they were used
to the experimental techniques. Additionally, we conducted three
baseline trials for each of the two tasks prior to beginning the vibro-
tactile conditions in VR. Each baseline trial lasted three minutes. We
refrained from expanding the baseline measurements because the
trials took approximately two hours to complete and included people
with MS who reported reduced physical functioning. To reduce the
learning effects, we counterbalanced both tasks and the vibrotactile
conditions in VR.

For CoP vibrotactile condition, we streamed the CoPx and CoPy
data from the balance board to Unity through sockets in order to
provide participants with CoP vibrotactile feedback based on their
balance board position. However, it is unknown how lower levels of
latency will alter our ﬁndings for this scenario.

One-second intervals were used to provide the ”rhythmic” vibro-
tactile feedback. We did not test this feedback condition across a
range of timeframes (e.g., two-second). For this reason, investiga-
tions that deliver ”rhythmic” vibrotactile stimulation with variable
time intervals may result in somewhat different conclusions.

Participants in the static vibrotactile feedback may have become
fatigued from listening to the vibration continuously. However, the
effect of fatigue in this situation was not quantiﬁed.

Noise was produced by the vibrating motors employed for vibro-
tactile feedback. Thus, it’s hard to determine whether the generated
noises affected balance improvement or not. To conﬁrm this, further
study will be required.

We did not modify the table height for the standing reach and
grasp task depending on the participant’s height, which may have
impacted the ﬁndings. However, there were no statistically signiﬁ-
cant variations in the heights of the participants (Table 1). Therefore,
we anticipated a minor impact.

Participants wore harnesses throughout the research to prevent
falls, which may have improved their balance somewhat. How-
ever, to ensure the consistency and safety of the research protocol,
we asked all participants to wear harnesses, regardless of whether
they had balance difﬁculties or not. Consequently, investigations
examining balance without a harness may obtain different ﬁndings.
The duration of the study was fairly lengthy, and participants
were expected to stand while experiencing the vibrotactile feedback.
This often led to weariness, and users were required to remove their
HMD and relax for a few minutes between sessions. This may have
enabled individuals to reestablish spatial awareness and balance,
which may have skewed the results.

Due to COVID-19 and our chosen test group, which included
individuals with BI caused by MS, the recruiting procedure was
challenging since many prospective volunteers had impaired immune

systems, putting them at high risk for COVID-19. Therefore, they
did not take part in the research. If the research had been conducted
outside of COVID-19, more people may have been recruited. In this
situation, we could have observed more signiﬁcant differences across
the various study conditions in VR for between-group comparisons.
Additional study is necessary to corroborate this.

8 CONCLUSION

In this study, we assessed the inﬂuence of several vibrotactile feed-
back modalities on VR balance. In our investigation, all vibrotactile
feedback conditions (spatial, CoP, rhythmic, and static) substantially
improved balance in VR. Spatial and CoP vibrotactile feedback
outperformed rhythmic and static conditions substantially. There
was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between spatial and CoP
conditions, nor between rhythmic and static conditions. Researchers
will be better able to comprehend the various types of vibrotac-
tile feedback for maintaining balance in an HMD-based VEs as a
consequence of these ﬁndings. In addition, this study may assist
developers in creating VR experiences that are more accessible and
useful for those with and without balance issues. We will investi-
gate locomotion challenges in our future research and evaluate the
efﬁcacy of vibrotactile feedback for gait improvement.
