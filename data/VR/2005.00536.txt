Abstract

Wireless virtual reality (VR) imposes new visual and haptic requirements that are directly linked

to the quality-of-experience (QoE) of VR users. These QoE requirements can only be met by wireless

connectivity that offers high-rate and high-reliability low latency communications (HRLLC), unlike the

low rates usually considered in vanilla ultra-reliable low latency communication scenarios. The high

rates for VR over short distances can only be supported by an enormous bandwidth, which is available

in terahertz (THz) frequency bands. Guaranteeing HRLLC requires dealing with the uncertainty that

is speciﬁc to the THz channel. To explore the potential of THz for meeting HRLLC requirements, a

quantiﬁcation of the risk for an unreliable VR performance is conducted through a novel and rigorous

characterization of the tail of the end-to-end (E2E) delay. Then, a thorough analysis of the tail-value-at-

risk (TVaR) is performed to concretely characterize the behavior of extreme wireless events crucial to

the real-time VR experience. System reliability for scenarios with guaranteed line-of-sight (LoS) is then

derived as a function of THz network parameters after deriving a novel expression for the probability

distribution function of the THz transmission delay. Numerical results show that abundant bandwidth

and low molecular absorption are necessary to improve the reliability. However, their effect remains

secondary compared to the availability of LoS, which signiﬁcantly affects the THz HRLLC performance.

In particular, for scenarios with guaranteed LoS, a reliability of 99.999% (with an E2E delay threshold

of 20 ms) for a bandwidth of 15 GHz along with data rates of 18.3 Gbps can be achieved by the THz

network (operating at a frequency of 1 THz), compared to a reliability of 96% for twice the bandwidth,

when blockages are considered.

I. INTRODUCTION

Virtual reality (VR) systems can create a sensorimotor and cognitive activity for users in an

artiﬁcially created world, thus, enabling a sense of total presence and immersion. However,

relying on wired VR systems signiﬁcantly limits the VR technology’s application domain.

Instead, the deployment of wireless VR, over cellular networks, can potentially unleash its true

potential [2] and [3]. In order to integrate VR services over wireless networks, it is imperative

to equip the wireless network with the ability to meet the stringent quality-of-service (QoS)

requirements of VR applications. On the one hand, it is important to ensure reliable low latency

communications [3], i.e., the instantaneous end-to-end (E2E) delay for wireless VR needs to

be very low in order to maintain a satisfactory user experience [4]–[6]. On the other hand,

along with high-reliability, wireless VR services also require high data rates to deliver the 360◦

content to their users. Unlike traditional low-rate ultra reliable low latency communications for

the Internet of Things [7], VR requires high-rate and high-reliability low latency communications

(HRLLC) where high reliability and high rates are simultaneously needed for the transmission of

large VR content packets [2]. Additionally, VR applications must immerse users in a seamless

experience, and, thus, existing reliability deﬁnitions such as in [8] must be extended accordingly

to encompass the unique timing requirements of VR. In particular, offering a high probability

of successful transmission must be considered within a given (low) latency constraint.

This challenge can be addressed only through the use of abundant bandwidth, available at

terahertz (THz) and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies [9]. In addition, support of high

reliability at these frequencies becomes plausible only for short distances, which is compatible

with the VR scenarios. Although deploying basic VR services is possible over 5G using mmWave

frequency bands, it is anticipated that a new generation of VR services, dubbed ultimate VR, will

soon be deployed [10]. In ultimate VR, perceptual and haptic requirements stem from soliciting

the ﬁve senses [2]. As discussed by Huawei Technologies in [11] and by the works in [3],

the stringent requirements of ultimate VR dictate an uncompressed bit rate of 1911.03 Gbps,

which warrants investigation of frequency bands beyond mmWave and brings the THz band

as a natural candidate. Furthermore, the established 5G standard by 3GPP for 360-degree VR

streaming services within Release-15 [12] motivates a sustainable support of VR services by

next-generation cellular systems. Particularly, ultimate VR will be a key element of beyond 5G

systems that will operate at THz bands. In fact, propagation at THz covers short range and is

susceptible to blockages and molecular absorption [13]. This results to an on-off behavior of the

3

wireless link and leads us to the hypothesis that, if properly managed, THz can potentially offer

HRLLC: simultaneously high rate, high reliability, and low latency for immersive VR experience.

Investigation of this hypothesis is the subject of this work.

A. Prior Works

A number of recent works addressed the challenges of wireless VR [3], [14]–[19]. In [3], the

authors discussed trends of wireless VR systems. The authors in [14] investigated the use of

communication-constrained mobile edge computing (MEC) systems for wireless VR. In [15],

the authors proposed a VR model using multi-attribute utility theory to capture the tracking and

delay components of VR QoS. Meanwhile, the recent works in [16]–[19] studied the problem of

HRLLC for VR networks. For instance, in [16], the authors introduced an MEC-based mobile

VR delivery framework that minimizes the average required rate. Meanwhile, the work in [17],

studied the challenge of concurrent support of visual and haptic perceptions over wireless

networks. The authors in [18] proposed a joint proactive computing and mmWave resource

allocation scheme for VR under latency and reliability constraints. A novel framework that uses

cellular-connected drone aerial vehicles was proposed in [19]. However, the prior works in [15]–

[19] only examine the average delays and data rates; thus reﬂecting limited information about

the wireless VR systems analyzed. In contrast, to guarantee HRLLC, it is necessary to obtain

the statistics of the delay in order to properly characterize the system’s reliability. Moreover, the

works in [15]–[19] do not consider the more challenging reliability problem at high-frequency

THz bands. Meanwhile, in [20], the authors investigate fundamental statistical issues related

to ultra-reliability of wireless networks. The work in [21] introduced the notion of probably

correct reliability (PCR) that is based on the probably approximately correct (PAC)-learning

framework in statistical learning. However, the works in [20] and [21] deﬁne reliability based

on an outage event, while ignoring the E2E behavior of the system. Finally, the use of THz has

recently attracted signiﬁcant attention (e.g., see [9] and [22]–[29]) as an enabler of high data rate

applications. However, these prior works in [9] and [22]–[29] focus primarily on the physical

layer, and they do not address HRLLC challenges for wireless VR.

B. Contributions

The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive performance analysis, in terms of

achievable delay, reliability, and rate, for a wireless THz network operating that serves VR

users. In order to assess the capability of THz network to meet the dual HRLLC, i.e., high-rate,

high-reliability QoS requirements of VR users, we make the following key contributions:

4

• We introduce a novel VR model based on a Matern hardcore point process (MHCPP):

Each VR user sends a request to its respective small base station (SBS) and the E2E delay

consists of the delay needed to process the VR images, the queuing delay, and the downlink

transmission delay over the THz links.

• Based on this model, to examine the instantaneous reliability of the system, we derive the

tail distribution of the E2E delay via its moments, thus characterizing the performance at

extreme events and providing insights on THz’s potential within a short communication

range given its high susceptibility to blockages and molecular absorption. Furthermore, to

scrutinize the risk of an unreliable VR user experience at THz, we derive the tail-value-at-

risk (TVaR) of the E2E delay based on rigorous tools from extreme value theory (EVT)

and economics [30], [31].

• Our analysis shows that the probability of line-of-sight (LoS) at THz frequencies, which

is inﬂuenced by the density of VR users and their mobility, plays a primary role in

characterizing the moments of the E2E delay. These results allow to characterize the tail

distribution of the E2E delay using the instantaneous VR content requests, channel, and

blockage parameters. Important insights are offered by the expected worst-case E2E delay,

and the conﬁdence level associated with the reliability.

• The asymptotic analysis of reliability is tailored to the unique THz network parameters.

It characterizes the E2E delay distribution by ﬁnding the cumulative distribution function

(CDF) of the E2E delay after deriving the probability distribution function (PDF) of the

transmission delay in a dense THz network.

To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that analyzes the reliability and latency achieved

by VR services over a THz cellular network.

C. Main Findings

Following these contributions, we answered the question of “Can THz provide high-rate

reliable, low latency communications for wireless VR?” as follows:

• For wireless VR services over THz networks, the characterization through quantities related

to average delay lead to overly optimistic performance prediction at THz. Instead, tail delays

reﬂect the performance during extreme events, such as a deep fade or a blockage. Analysis

of extreme events is fundamental, as the occurrence of any such event during a VR session

will lead to a disruption of the quality-of-experience (QoE). Our results show that, during

5

a typical VR session THz the tail of E2E delay can range from 30 ms to 90 ms leading

to an unreliable VR experience, even when the average delay is 20 ms. Hence, achieving

HRLLC requires new mechanisms that can guarantee LoS link and alleviate the harsh

propagation conditions at THz. For example, such is the intelligent environment based on

large multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) arrays [22] and [32].

• From our results, we observe that increasing the bandwidth and reducing the THz molecular

absorption coefﬁcient can reduce the risk of worst-case extreme events, but are not sufﬁcient

to sustain a reliable experience. Moreover, guaranteeing a TVaR with conﬁdence levels (i.e.

the reliability during extreme events) above 90 % is only possible at tail delays of 100 ms,

even at a signiﬁcant bandwidth of 30 GHz.

• One of the most fundamental challenges to THz’s reliability is the availability of LoS

component. Overcoming this challenge, ensures that THz can provide HRLLC via network

densiﬁcation and signiﬁcant bandwidths. In particular, our results show that, if one can

ensure that the THz network can continuously operate at LoS, a reliability of 99.999%

(with an E2E delay threshold of 20 ms) is achievable along with data rates of 18.3 Gbps,

thus, delivering promising rates to support ultimate VR’s needs.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the system model. Sections

III and IV, respectively, present the reliability analysis and asymptotic analysis of reliability.

Section V presents the simulation results and conclusions are drawn in in Section VI.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

Consider the downlink of a small cell network servicing a set V of V wireless VR users via

a set of small base stations (SBSs) operating at THz frequencies and densely distributed in a

conﬁned indoor area according to an isotropic homogeneous MHCPP with intensity η and a

minimum distance (cid:15) [33]. This process is a special thinning of the Poisson point process (PPP)

in which the nodes are forbidden to be closer than a minimum distance (cid:15), as in practice the

distance between adjacent SBSs cannot be arbitrarily small. Hence, this process can adequately

capture the distribution of VR SBSs in a conﬁned area. In our network, SBSs can also perform

MEC functions for VR purposes and the VR users are associated to the SBS with highest

signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR).

A. Blockage and Interference Model

We consider an arbitrary VR user in V located at a constant distance r0 from its serving

SBS. The chosen VR user and its serving SBS are referred to as tagged receiver and transmitter

respectively. The interference surrounding this VR user stems from a set M of M non-negligibly

interfering SBSs that are located within a radius of Ω around this user. Henceforth, SBSs that

are at a distance r ≥ Ω add no interference on the link between the VR user and its associated

SBS, Ω refers to the region of non negligible interference of the network. It is important to

note that interference occurs because we consider a highly dense THz network whose SBSs are

located at very close proximity [34], [35]. Moreover, in such a dense environment, THz bands

require a very narrow pencil beamforming (even narrower than mmWave). Such beamforming

architectures face major practical challenges given that they require a high available SINR link

and a narrow beamsteering angle, while providing localization and tracking of the user equipment

(UE) [36]. This also leads to higher susceptibility towards mobility, and does not completely

solve the interference problem, given the difﬁculty to perform beam re-alignment in a short time

[37].

Another key challenge facing THz communications in such a dense network is the inability

to penetrate solid objects. In fact, the electromagnetic properties of THz are different than

7

conventional bands, i.e., their penetration losses are higher whereas their reﬂection coefﬁcients

are reduced1 [38]. Subsequently, the susceptibility of THz to blockage jeopardizes its reliability,

thus, highlighting the importance of studying the probability of blockage, that further provides

insights about the tunable parameters needed to guarantee a LoS link between the SBS and

the VR user. Since we consider an indoor setting, two type of blockage are considered: self-

blockage and dynamic blockage. Self-blockage arises when a user blocks a fraction of SBSs by

its own body. We assume that each user makes an angle ω with the blocked SBSs. ω determines

the orientation of the user and is assumed to be uniformly distributed in [0,2π], as shown in

Fig. 1. The uniform probability here captures the free range of motion of mobile VR users in all

directions. In fact, real-world experiments in [39] show that the azimuth angle follows closely

a uniform distribution along [−π,π], thus, conﬁrming our selected range for ω. As such, the

self-blockage zone is deﬁned as the sector of a disc of radius B having an angle ω. Without

loss of generality, hereinafter, we assume that B = Ω, i.e., the blockage disc and the region

of non-negligible interference coincide, and, thus, we will use Ω to refer to this region. This

assumption is justiﬁed given that interferers and blockages are only non-negligible within a

speciﬁc radius surrounding a considered VR user. As such, this region draws the boundaries of

the THz communication range around the considered user. Thus, an SBS is considered to be self-

blocked if it lies in the self-blockage region of the considered VR user. Hence, the probability
of self-blockage will be [40]: P (Bs) = ω

2π , where Bs is a random variable that captures self-

blockage event.

The second type of blockage is dynamic blockage, which captures the event in which the LoS

signal between the considered VR user and its corresponding SBS is interrupted by other VR

users. The VR users contributing to dynamic blockage are moving in a blockage area of radius

Ω within which a set Q of q SBSs are susceptible to blockage. The VR users in this region

are referred to as dynamic blockers, and they are distributed according to a homogeneous PPP

with density ιB. The dynamic blockers move in a random direction in this area with velocity

vB. Subsequently, the overall dynamic blockage process can be modeled as an M/M/∞ queuing

1This behavior is similar to mmWave bands but is more pronounced for THz. For instance, while the molecular absorption

effect might be negligible for mmWave frequency bands, it is more signiﬁcant at THz frequencies and it needs to be taken into

consideration.

system2, as explained in [40]. The ﬁrst M stands for a Poisson arrival process of blockers with a

rate of κBi blockers/sec, and the second M stands for a blockage duration that is assumed to be

exponentially distributed with parameter ν blockers/sec. To make our calculations tractable, we

use the approach from [40] to model the dynamic blockage and further approximate the MHCPP

by an equivalent PPP of intensity ηP . This is justiﬁed by the fact that our dense network will

naturally have small distances between SBSs. Nevertheless, apart from this blockage modeling,

we keep the deployment according to an MHCPP rather than a ﬁltered PPP. A simultaneous

blockage event by two or more dynamic blockers for the same LoS link is a negligible event, and,

thus, it is assumed to be a null event. This is a result of the short range of THz communication

links and the low likelihood of two users simultaneously disrupting a link of a few meters.
Let r (cid:44) (ri)i=0,1,··· ,q be a row vector, where r0 denotes the distance between the VR user

and the associated SBS, and ri denotes the distance between the VR user and the blocked

SBS i ∈ Q. The SBS distances to the VR user are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) with distribution f (ri|q) = 2ri
by [40]: P (Bd|ri, q) = κBi

Ω2 . Hence, the probability of dynamic blockage is given
κBi+ν . Considering both self and dynamic blockage, the probability of

simultaneous blockage of all LoS links is given by:

2While an ideal model would follow an M/G/∞ queue as an alternating renewal process with exponentially distributed periods

B. Wireless Model and Data Rate

As shown in [35], the THz signal propagation is mainly affected by molecular absorption3,

which results in molecular absorption loss and molecular absorption noise. At THz, the gap

between the LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links is very signiﬁcant and more drastic than at

mmWave frequencies. Given that the distance between a VR user and its respective SBS is short

in our dense network, we consider only the LoS link. Consequently, the total path loss affecting

the transmitted signal between the SBS and the VR user will be given by [35]:

L(f, r) = Ls(f, r)Lm(f, r) =

(cid:19)2

(cid:18) 4πf r

τ (f, r)

,

(1)

where Ls(f, r) = ( 4πf r

c )2 is the free-space propagation loss, Lm(f, r) = 1
τ (f,r) is the molecular
absorption loss, f is the operating frequency, r is the distance between the VR user and the

SBS, c is the speed of light, and τ (f, r) is the transmittance of the medium following the Beer-

Lambert law, i.e., τ (f, r) ≈ exp(−K(f )r), where K(f ) is the overall absorption coefﬁcient of

the medium. For sub-THz frequencies (0.1−0.275 THz) K(f ) can be calculated using the model

suggested by [42]. Meanwhile, for frequencies higher than 0.275 THz, K(f ) can be obtained
from the high resolution transmission (HITRAN) database [43]. Let p (cid:44) (pi)i=0,1,··· ,M be a row

vector, where p0 represents the transmission power of the SBS servicing the considered VR user,

and pi represents the transmission power of the interference from any other SBS i ∈ M. The

total noise power is the sum of the molecular absorption noise and the Johnson-Nyquist noise

generated by thermal agitation of electrons in conductors. Consequently, the total noise power

at the receiver can be given by [35]:

the transmitted signal and considering the M backlogged SBSs in the region of non-negligible
interference, the aggregate interference will be [35]: I(r, pi, f ) = (cid:80)M
i e−K(f )ri. The
instantaneous frequency-dependent SINR at LoS will be:

where W is the bandwidth. Subsequently, the total instantaneous achievable rate is given by:
CT = P (Λ)CL + P (1 − Λ)CN (cid:117) P (Λ)CL.

(6)

Here, CN is the rate of the NLoS link and P (Λ) is the probability of an available LoS link
between the SBS and the VR user. The approximation in (6) is based on the signiﬁcant gap

between the power of LoS and NLoS links, thus leading to a negligible rate for the NLoS link.

Note that, P (Λ) is fundamental in our analysis given that it can degrade the rate and affect the

QoE of the VR users. Given the probabilities of static and dynamic blockages, in Section III,

the probability of LoS will be derived in terms of the network parameters.

C. Interference Analysis

From (5), we can see that the only random factor is the second term in the denominator which

corresponds to the interfering signals. For technical tractability, following [35], we assume that

this term tends to a normal distribution [45]. Note that, it has been shown in [35] that such an

approximation is realistic. Furthermore, ﬁnding the mean and variance of this term will allow

us to characterize the PDF of this random interference signal, as follows:

(8)

where (cid:15) is the minimum distance of the MHCPP, Ω is the region of non-negligible interference,

and the subscript i in pi is omitted given that the SBSs are assumed to have the same transmission

power. Thus, the interference distribution follows a normal distribution as a result of the high

density in the deployment of the SBSs as well as their distribution according to an MHCPP. THz

networks must be dense in order to combat the range limitations and to reduce the likelihood

11

of blockages. Given that the distances at THz tend to be small, it is necessary to introduce a

correlation between the nodes and prevent them from being arbitrarily close to each other. Hence,

our model not only reﬂects realistic THz deployment conditions, but it also highlights the fact

that interference converges asymptotically to a normal distribution, improving the tractability

of the analysis. Next, we analyze whether this network can provide HRLLC guaranteeing the

dual VR requirement and enabling a seamless experience. In fact, the rate requirement can

easily be achieved by taking advantage of the large THz bandwidth, nevertheless, the reliability

remains unclear. As such, to scrutinize the performance of the THz reliability in terms of the

E2E delay, we rigorously characterize the distribution of its tail, thus, outlining the worst-case

performance. Then, we analyze the moments of delay and, then, leverage this analysis to derive

the tail distribution and its associated TVaR.

III. RELIABILITY ANALYSIS
In this section, we examine the probability of blockage and use it to derive the tail distribution

of the E2E delay. Furthermore, we evaluate the TVaR of the E2E delay to scrutinize the risks

pertaining to an unreliable VR experience at the THz band.
A. Blockage Analysis

Given the electromagnetic properties of THz and its susceptibility to blockage, guaranteeing

a LoS path link is necessary to provide the promised high THz rate. Therefore, it is necessary

to quantify the probability of an available LoS link in terms of the channel parameters, thus,

characterizing the conditions needed to boost the QoE of the user. Next, given the static and

dynamic blockages modeled, we derive the probability of having an available LoS link:
Proposition 1. In the considered network, the probability of LoS is given by:

P (Λ) = 1 − exp(cid:0)κℵηP πΩ2(cid:1),

(9)

where Λ is the event of having a LoS path, and ℵ =

Proof: See Appendix A.

.

The probability of LoS in (9) captures the susceptibility of the THz links to blockage as an

exponential function of the network parameters. We observe that an increase in the density of

the VR blockers or in the region of blockage affects negatively the availability of LoS. Also,

the bigger the sector of the disc of self-blockage, the lower the availability of LoS.

B. Delay Analysis

1) Queuing Analysis: The service model of the VR content request in our wireless VR system

is illustrated in Fig. 2. In this model, once a VR user requests a new VR content, it goes through

12

Figure 2: Illustrative example of our queuing model.

two queues: A ﬁrst queue, Q1, for processing a 360◦ VR content, and a second queue, Q2,

for storing and transmitting the VR content over the wireless THz channel. In particular, Q1’s

processing tasks comprise rendering the VR content to be to be viewable on an head-mounted

display (HMD). In other words, the MEC processor needs to perform projective transformation

operations to render and reverse-project the VR content [46]. Also, the MEC processor needs

to process the virtual haptic feedback received by the VR user. Subsequently, it will render this

haptic feedback so that the VR user experiences different vibrations and forces while using the

VR gloves. We assume that the time a VR user needs for sending a request is negligible. Hence,

for each VR content request, the total delay depends on the waiting and the processing time

at Q1 and the waiting time and VR transmission delay at Q2. We consider a Poisson arrival

process for the VR content requests with mean rate λ1. The buffer of the processor is assumed

to be of inﬁnite size and the MEC processor at the SBS adopts a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-serve (FCFS)

policy. The service time for each request follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter

µ1 > λ1, to guarantee the stability of the ﬁrst queue Q1. Thus, we can model queue Q1 as

an M/M/1 queue. This model can reasonably capture the computation of tasks, as well as the

mobility of users requesting VR content [47]. According to Burke’s theorem [48], when the

service rate is larger than the arrival rate for an M/M/1 queue4, then the departure process at

steady state is a Poisson process with the same arrival rate. Hence, the arrival of requests to

Q2 also follows a Poisson process with rate λ2 = µ1. Similar to Q1, we assume an inﬁnite

buffer size and an FCFS policy for Q2. Note that, the service time of Q2 is the transmission

time of the SBS, that depends on the random wireless THz channel, i.e., the size of the VR

content, the LoS rate, and its associated probability of LoS. Thus, different from Q1, the second

queue Q2 is an M/G/1 queue. Our goal is to study when and how the proposed THz system can

guarantee the dual HRLLC QoS requirements of VR, i.e. visual and haptic perceptions. This dual

speciﬁcation requires a high data rate link for visual perception and a low latency communication

for the haptic. Under favorable channel conditions, THz can provide high rate links, however,

providing HRLLC may be challenging. Hence, our key step is to deﬁne the system reliability

and study the fundamental performance of the VR network in terms of HRLLC requirements.

This fundamental performance analysis will shed light on the capability of THz to provide a

dual-metric performance for VR: high rate and high reliability.

In our system, reliability cannot be deﬁned merely on average values of delays as done in

[3] and [15]. Given the stringent requirements of VR services, a full view on the statistics of

the delay must be taken into account to design a system capable of withstanding extreme and

infrequently occurring events such as a sudden user movement or a sudden blockage event which

can impact reliability. To analyze reliability, next, we derive the moments of the E2E delay and

use them to derive the tail distribution of the E2E delay. Based on the expression of the tail

distribution, the TVaR will be derived to characterize the value of the E2E delay at the tail, in

the presence of a risk of an unreliable user experience.

2) Tail Reliability Analysis: Fundamentally, to guarantee reliability in the face of stochastic

and dynamic wireless channels, its is necessary to analyze the instantaneous behavior of the

network rather than its average [49]. Furthermore, it is necessary to examine any instantaneous

exceedance of the E2E delay above a threshold that disrupts the QoS of the user. Hereinafter,

given that VR services call for perceptual and haptic requirements that are directly linked to the

QoE of the user; we deﬁne the reliability of the VR system as a guarantee that the instantaneous

E2E delay can be maintained below a target threshold δ. Formally and according to 3GPP

[8], reliability is deﬁned as the capability of transmitting a given amount of trafﬁc within a

predetermined time duration with high success probability. Nevertheless, given that our trafﬁc

consists of VR content that needs more stringent reliability measures to ensure a seamless

experience, we fortify that statement and make it more stringent by deﬁning reliability as the

probability that the E2E delay – deﬁned as the delay incurred between the time the VR user

requests a VR image to the time the image is received – remains below a stringent threshold δ.

Hence, the system is guaranteed to have ultra high reliability when this probability is high and

tends to 1. Furthermore, central statistical characteristics of the E2E delay such as the average

14

or median performance do not guarantee a continuously reliable system. Meanwhile, shifting our

focus to extreme values of the E2E delay and their corresponding limiting distribution allows us

to guarantee a highly reliable system under very difﬁcult conditions. In other words, analyzing the

behavior of E2E tail delay distributions is suited to capture the reliability response vis-`a-vis the

worst-case conditions, i.e., tail analysis will guarantee high reliability for a user experiencing

a deep fade or a sudden blockage. Thus, this guarantees an instantaneous and continuously

reliable THz system. Subsequently, we leverage the renowned EVT framework [30] to capture

the behavior of the tails and extreme statistics of interest. In fact, EVT has two different classes

of models, block maxima and peak-over-threshold models. Block maxima data points tend to

be measured over a particular period of time (e.g. VR session time in our case) and tend to

be time-sensitive. Meanwhile, peak-over-threshold models are only useful when the threshold

of observations is known a priori. Furthermore, peak-over-threshold models are usually used

in time independent data. Hereinafter, we are interested in the class of block maxima models.

Consequently, the EVT theorem is formally deﬁned as:
Deﬁnition 1. (Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem [50]) Given a sequence of i.i.d. variables

{x1, . . . , xn}, the distribution of Mn = max{x1, . . . , xn} representing the maximum value of

In our model, the sequence of i.i.d. variables corresponds to the sequence of E2E delays

experienced by the VR user; subsequently, this theorem paves the way to characterize the

distribution of the maximum E2E delay that a VR user can experience, and hence the worst-case

scenario. Consequently, next, we perform moment matching to match the moments of the GEV

distribution to those of the moments of the E2E delay over our THz network. First, for our

model in Fig. 2, given that Q1 is an M/M/1 queue, the mean of the total waiting time at Q1 will

moments and the GEV distribution, to ﬁnally characterize the tail distribution. Note that this

Proof: See Appendix B.

From (13), we can see that the average E2E delay is equally inﬂuenced by the mean of

the total waiting time in Q1, the utilization of Q2, and the mean of the transmission delay α

(and thus the THz environment). The waiting time in Q1 is mainly inﬂuenced by the number

of VR requests and the processing speed of the MEC server, which are beyond the control of

the wireless network. Meanwhile, the transmission delay depends on the average blockage rate

(which in turn is the complement of P (Λ) derived in (9) in Proposition 1) and the average THz

data rate. Clearly, the density of VR users, their mobility, and their requests for VR content

all play a role in the average behavior of the network. Next, we derive the second moment of

the E2E delay, thus allowing us later to capture the GEV of the E2E delay and examine the

instantaneous E2E delay and its consequent effect on the QoE.

Having the ﬁrst and second moment in (13) and (15) of the E2E delay allows us to derive

the moments of the highest order statistics of the E2E delay to ﬁnally characterize the tail

distribution. To do so, in what follows, we ﬁrst order the set of E2E delays and arrange them in

an increasing order of magnitude. Subsequently, we model the tail of the E2E delay to be the

highest order statistic, i.e., the maximum of the set. Given that we have obtained the ﬁrst and

second moments of the parent distribution of the E2E delay, we need to express the ﬁrst and

second moments of the highest order statistic in terms of the expectations formulated in Theorem

1 and Lemma 1. Thus, from [51], given the mean and variance of the parent distribution, we

can ﬁnd the highest order statistics expectation as:

Proof: See Appendix D.

Theorem 2 allows us to tractably characterize the tail of the distribution E2E , i.e., the worst

case distribution over all of the possible outcomes of randomness rather than just an average

value. Moreover, interestingly the tail distribution’s location µE is the average of the E2E delay.

Thus, the distribution of the tail of the E2E delay is centered around the mean of the E2E delay.

Moreover, the scale of the distribution is the variance of the E2E delay. We can see that the tail

variance is highly inﬂuenced by the ﬁrst three moments of the THz data rate, thus characterizing

the susceptible THz behavior to the dynamic environment. As for the shape, it depends on the

number of VR requests in each VR session. Therefore, the moments of the E2E delay mirror

variations of lower order statistics to obtain the highest order statistic distribution.

17

By obtaining the tail statistics and its distribution, we can further quantify the E2E delay value

given a speciﬁc level of risk of unreliable experience. In other words, we deﬁne the notion of

risk based on its conﬁdence level: a conﬁdence level of 99% means that we are 99% sure that the

worst-case delay will not exceed a speciﬁc value. Clearly, examining tail distributions not only

characterizes the worst-case scenario but also provides guarantees through risk measures, thus

providing more leverage for HRLLC. To formulate these risk measures, in actuarial sciences,

the value-at-risk (VaR) concept is deﬁned as a quantile of the distribution of aggregate losses,

VaR1−α = − inf t∈R{P (X ≤ t) ≥ 1 − α} [52]. However, VaR is an incoherent5 and intractable

risk measure. TVaR, on the other hand, is deﬁned as the expected loss conditioned on the loss

exceeding the VaR [53]. Thus, TVaR not only measures the risk but also quantiﬁes its severity,

making it a superior risk measure. In our context, the TVaR allows us to scrutinize the tail of

the E2E delay, at a given conﬁdence level. Thus, if the instantaneous E2E delay follows a PDF

Φ(t), such that the E2E delay does not exceed a certain threshold γ, we can deﬁne the risk of an
unreliable QoE to be related to the VaR as follows:(cid:82) ∞
Subsequently, we deﬁne χ to be the right-tail TVaR to be deﬁned as: χ = 1

γ Φ(t)dt = 1 − αC, where VaR(αC) = γ.

Given our knowledge about the GEV distribution, the TVaR for our network can be formally

derived next (following directly from Theorem 2).
Corollary 1. The TVaR of the E2E delay Te is given by:

(20)

As seen from (20), the TVaR is a tractable expression that is a function of the ﬁrst and second

moment of the E2E delay. These moments bring to view the fastness and robustness of THz

frequency bands and the MEC server in a dynamic VR environment. Based on these moments,

the TVaR provides us with the expected E2E delay conditioned on the E2E delay exceeding a

speciﬁc threshold. In other words, it helps shed light on the severity of exceeding the threshold,

by quantifying the expectation of the tail distribution. Considering the TVaR allows us to provide

the user a seamless experience with a reliability in the order of its conﬁdence level. A conﬁdence

5A coherent risk measure is a metric that satisﬁes properties of monotonicity, sub-additivity, homogeneity, and translational

invariance.

18

level of αC guarantees the maximum E2E delay to be below that threshold, αCth of the time.

Next, we perform an asymptotic analysis for reliability under idealized conditions in which

we assume the probability of LoS to be equal to 1.

IV. RELIABILITY FOR SCENARIOS WITH GUARANTEED LOS

Hereinafter, we assume the probability of LoS to be equal to 1, i.e., a continuous LoS is

available to the VR user. Thus, this facilitates our model further making it feasible to analyze

true CDFs and PDFs of the delay instead of relying on tail distributions. This special case scenario

is meaningful given that it portrays cases where the number of active VR users is signiﬁcantly

low in the indoor area and where the user’s orientation does not vary rapidly. Subsequently, for

our model in Fig. 2, given that Q1 is an M/M/1 queue, the PDF of the total waiting time at Q1

will be [48]:

ψ1(t) = (µ1 − λ1) exp (−(µ1 − λ1)t) .

(21)

Given that Q2 is an M/G/1 queue and that the queuing and service time of an M/G/1 queue are

independent, we ﬁnd the CDF of the total waiting time: Ψ2(t) = ΨQ2(t) ∗ ψT (t), where ∗ is the

convolution operator, ΨQ2(t) is the CDF of the queuing time at Q2 and ψT (t) is the PDF of the

transmission delay. The CDF of the total queuing time at Q2 will be [48]:

ΨQ2(t) = (1 − ρ2)

Γ

(22)

Here, Γ is the number of states that the queue has went through, i.e., the number of packets that

n=0

has passed through the queue during a certain amount of time and R(n)(t) is the CDF of the

residual service time after the n-th state. Note that R(n)(t) can be computed by obtaining the
residual service time distribution R(t) after n packets, R(t) = (cid:82) t

0 µ2(1 − ψT (x))dx, where t is
the time of an arbitrary arrival, given that the arrival occurs when the server is busy. To evaluate

the PDF of the E2E delay, we need the PDF of the transmission delay which is found next:
Lemma 2. The PDF of the transmission delay is given by:

It is important to note that the PDF in (23) does not follow a normal distribution since both

Υ and ζ depend on the transmission delay α. Burke’s Theorem allows us to infer that Q1 and

19

Q2 are independent, and, thus, the CDF of the E2E delay can be expressed as the convolution

of the PDF of the total waiting time in Q1 and the CDF of the total waiting time in Q2. By

using the dynamics in (21) and (22), the CDF of the E2E delay can formally expressed in the

following theorem which is a direct result of Lemma 2.

Theorem 3. The CDF of the E2E delay Te is given by:

Φ(t) = P (Te ≤ t) = ψ1(t) ∗ Ψ2(t) = ψ1(t) ∗ (ΨQ2(t) ∗ ψT (t))

Consequently, the reliability with respect to a certain threshold δ, is given by:

(cid:37) = P (Te ≤ δ) = Φ(δ).

(25)

The reliability deﬁned in (25) provides a tractable characterization of the reliability of the VR

system shown in Fig. 1, as function of the THz channel parameters. For instance, from Theorem

3, we can ﬁrst observe that the queuing time of Q2 depends on the residual service time CDF

and, thus, on the transmission delay. Also, given that the processing speed of a MEC server can

be considerably high, the E2E delay will often be dominated by the transmission delay over the

THz channel. In general, all the key parameters that have a high impact on the transmission

delay will have a higher impact on reliability. One of the most important key parameters is the

distance r0 between the VR user and its respective SBS; this follows from the fact that the

molecular absorption loss gets signiﬁcantly higher when the distance increases, which limits the

communication range of THz SBSs to very few meters. Indeed, the THz reliability will deteriorate

drastically if the distance between the VR user and its respective SBS increased. Also, in this

special case, the PDF of the E2E delay is tractable. Thus, providing the full statistics of the E2E

delay without having to examine averages and tails to scrutinize the risks pertaining to reliability.

In other words, the PDF of the E2E delay provides us with generalizable information, reﬂecting

the overall behavior of reliability in this model. Hence, while the tail reliability analyzed in

Section III is mostly threatened by the probability of blockage, in this scenario, the challenges

that need to be addressed to provide a robust reliability are the short communication range as

result of the molecular absorption effect, and the interference stemming from the high network

density. Moreover, given the QoS of a VR application is a function of the reliability, i.e., it

is the reliability of the system throughout the worst case scenario. VR users’ immersion and

experience will depend signiﬁcantly on the reliability. Therefore, maintaining reliability is a

it a seamless experience.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
For our simulations, we consider a setting in which VR users are receiving VR content as

they engage in a VR video game (Star Wars: Squadrons). The SBSs are deployed in an indoor

area modeled as a square of size 20 m × 20 m at T = 300 K. The simulation was performed

on MATLAB and all statistical results are averaged over 2, 500 independent runs. The main

simulation parameters are shown in Table II. The molecular absorption coefﬁcient has been

obtained using the HITRAN database for 1 THz and using the sub-THz model [42] for 0.2 THz.

The processing rate of Q1 is chosen to comply with existing VR processing units such as the

GEFORCE RTX 2080 Ti [54]. In what follows, we compare how the realistic scenario, i.e., when

considering blockages in Section II, contrasts with the asymptotic analysis we have performed

in Section IV where LoS is always guaranteed.

Fig. 3a shows that the simulation results match the distribution of the analytical result derived

in Theorem 2. The small mismatch between the analytical and simulation results stems from the

use of Jensen’s inequality. We can see that the tail of E2E delay is centered around 40 ms, but can

reach up to 100 ms. Moreover, Fig. 3b shows that the simulation results match the distribution

of the analytical result derived in (23). The small gap between the analytical and simulation

results stems from the use of the normal distribution assumption for the interference. Here, we

can see how that the transmission delay is low, i.e., it is centered at 0.75 ms, owing to the high

data rates at THz frequency bands.

Fig. 4 shows how the average, instantaneous, and tail E2E delays experienced by the user

during a VR session, vary, respectively for a carrier frequency of f = 1 THz. We can see that the

average E2E delay provides a positive viewpoint of the reliability of THz, as its upper bound is

limited by 20 ms. Moreover, for the instantaneous E2E delay, we can see how a single extreme

event (a sudden blockage) throughout the VR session can suddenly disrupt the VR experience.

This is why, it is important to model the distribution of tails characterizing these extreme events.

In that prospect, Fig. 4c shows a negative perspective of reliability, as the tails are lower bounded

by an E2E delay of 30 ms, i.e., any extreme event will lead to a minimum E2E delay of 30 ms,

thus leading to a sudden disruption of the user’s experience. Clearly, Fig. 4 reveals that average

designs overlook extreme events that disrupt real-time experiences. Therefore, it is important to

provide solutions that particularly improve the tail performance of THz, given that on average

reliability is high.

Similarly to Fig. 4, Fig. 5 characterizes the sub-THz performance of the average, instantaneous,

and tail E2E delays at a carrier frequency of f = 0.2 THz. The sub-THz performance also

portrays a positive viewpoint of the reliability of THz, whereby its upper bound is limited by

15 ms. Moreover, the instantaneous E2E delay shows a disruption due a single extreme event at

time 200 s of the VR session. Interestingly, the upper bound of the average, instantaneous, and

tail delay is considerably lower compared to the performance at f = 1 THz. Meanwhile, the

lower bound is higher. This is attributed to the fact that higher bands are characterized by an all

or nothing behavior. In other words, at higher carrier frequencies, lower transmission delays can

be achieved, thus leading to extremely low E2E delays at the lower bounds. Nevertheless, the

higher end of the THz frequency bands experiences a higher susceptibility to extreme events,

thus contributing to more breaks in the service and heavier tails.

Fig. 6a and Fig. 7a show the prominent effect of the bandwidth on the delays of Q1 and

Q2, in presence of blockages and for the idealized, guaranteed LoS scenario at THz and sub-

THz respectively. We can see that, in both cases, increasing the bandwidth ensures a reliable

performance, but remains limited by the processing speed at the MEC server. Nevertheless,

considering blockages increases Q2 delay on average from 0.3 ms to 4 ms at a bandwidth of

20 GHz for THz frequencies, and from 0.23 ms to 3.5 ms at a bandwidth of 20 GHz for sub-

THz frequencies. Therefore, in presence of blockage, increasing the bandwidth ((up to 30 GHz)

30 GHz) is not sufﬁcient to guarantee a high reliability. Interestingly, when increasing the

bandwidth at f = 0.2 THz the transmission delay sees a more signiﬁcant change. Thus, changing

the bandwidth has a greater impact when the network operates at f = 0.2 THz compared to

f = 1 THz. This phenomenon is observed due to the more pronounced extreme events at higher

carrier frequencies. In particular, Fig. 6b shows that the reliability of THz at f = 1 THz is limited

to 68% and 96% for a target delay of δ = 10 ms and δ = 20 ms at a signiﬁcant bandwidth of

30 GHz. In contrast, in the guaranteed LoS scenario, we need a bandwidth of 15 GHz to achieve

a reliability of 99.999 %, thus reducing signiﬁcant spectrum resources when LoS is available,

this also corresponds to a data rate of 18.3 Gbps. Meanwhile, at f = 0.2 THz, the performance

is limited to 80% and 98% for a target delay of δ = 10 ms and δ = 20 ms at a bandwidth of

30 GHz. However, this comes at the expense of a lower data rate of 11.5 Gbps.

To assess the reliability of the tails, Fig. 8a shows how the TVaR varies with respect to the

conﬁdence level αC. We can observe that while it is fairly easy to guarantee tail delays with

a conﬁdence of 80% at 30 ms, yet it is very difﬁcult to tame low E2E tail delay with a risk

percentile above 90 %. In fact, at a conﬁdence level of 99 %, the tail E2E delay becomes as

high as 450 ms, compared to 63 ms at a conﬁdence level of 90 %. Moreover, Fig. 8b shows the

effect of bandwidth on the TVaR at a conﬁdence level of 95 %: Clearly, an increased bandwidth

reduces the risk of occurrence of extreme events. Nevertheless, given the susceptibility of THz to

the dynamic network conditions, increasing the bandwidth remains limited by a best-case TVaR

of 100 ms. Additionally, taking into account the beam-tracking delay6 shows higher values of

prediction algorithm, similar to the one in [55].

TVaR. Hence, in this case, increasing the bandwidth remains limited by a best-case TVaR of

130 ms.

Fig. 9a shows the effect of the molecular absorption coefﬁcient on the E2E delay, we can

see that with a guaranteed LoS, the E2E delay increases monotonically with the molecular

absorption. Nevertheless, when blockages are considered, the THz electromagnetic properties

make it more susceptible to the dynamic environment as the molecular absorption coefﬁcient

increases, thus, increasing the occurrence of signal disruptions and leading to ﬂuctuations as the

molecular absorption increases. Moreover, we can see in Fig. 9b that the molecular absorption

has a more pronounced effect on the reliability of the system when considering blockages, this

is observed regardless of the reliability threshold δ. Clearly, for a threshold δ = 10 ms, the

availability of LoS improves the reliability by 13 % (from 70 % to 83 %).

Fig. 10 shows how the reliability varies as a function of the region of non-negligible interfer-

ence, in the guaranteed LoS scenario. We can see that, when the distance between the VR user

and the SBS increases, the region of non-negligible interference Ω has a higher impact on the

reliability, and the drop of reliability is sharper. This phenomenon is observed regardless of the

reliability threshold δ. Hence, even though the user can achieve high reliability, the dependence

of the molecular absorption on distance limits the user to a very short distance to its respective

SBS. Thus, the VR user can be guaranteed reliability regardless of the interference surrounding

it, given that it is at a proximity of the respective SBS.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the feasibility of ensuring reliability of VR services in the

THz band. To obtain an expression for the E2E delay and reliability, we have proposed a model

based on a two tandem queue, in which we have derived the tail distribution of the E2E delay

via its lower order moments. Subsequently, we have derived the TVaR of the E2E delay tail,

characterizing the worst case scenario. Furthermore, we have conducted an asymptotic analysis

where we derived the PDF of the transmission delay of a THz cellular network, based on

which, we have derived the E2E delay expression along with the reliability of this system. We

particularly have made the following observations regarding the reliability of THz networks:

• While it is necessary to increase the bandwidth and operate at regions of low molecular

absorption, e.g., indoor areas, to provide a reliable experience; extreme events resulting

from the unavailability of LoS links, disrupt the user’s QoE and increase the E2E delay

signiﬁcantly.

• Performance analyses based on the tail of E2E delays are fundamental to characterize

the THz performance, given the insights it provides on extreme events. In that regard,

guaranteeing a LoS is of primary importance to improve the tail performance. Such a

24681012Region of non-negligible interference (m)00.20.40.60.81Reliability26

guarantee becomes more challenging in outdoor areas and with highly mobile UE. It is

thus necessary to explore directions that optimize, and increase the availability of LoS links

in THz. One potential solution could be the deployment of RIS as done in our work in

[32]. Another method is to leverage the synergy of THz frequencies with lower frequency

bands at the control plane [56].

• Independent from the network architecture, guaranteeing continuous THz LoS links neces-

sitates predicting the user’s micro-mobility and micro-orientation at every time step. Having

such predictions in hand allows the network operator to mitigate the intermittent nature of

THz links. Thus, it signiﬁcantly improves the system reliability. Henceforth, the artiﬁcial

intelligence (AI) approaches suggested in [19], [32] and [56] can be extended to our studied

model, leading to a promising subject of future work.

• After guaranteeing a LoS availability, the THz reliability remains impeded by factors such

as the short communication range due to the molecular absorption effect and the interference

arising due to the high network density. Consequently, it is necessary to explore new

predictive mechanisms that can handle the large-scale nature of a wireless network and

that is reliable in face of high uncertainty and extreme network conditions.

B. Proof of Theorem 1

Proof: Based on (5), we express the transmission delay in terms of the VR content size L,

CL, and α, as follows:

α =

E[α] =

ϑ(P (Λ)CL)
[E(P (Λ)CL)]2 },

(28)

where the ϑ operator is the variance and Cov is the covariance.

Since the VR image size is constant, and that P (Λ) and CL are independent, we have: E[α] =

L

E[P (Λ)]E[CL] . Thus, we can now compute the expected value of P (Λ) and CL respectively

E[P (Λ)] =

where Z = κℵηP Ω2. Based on (5), the P (Λ) acts as a discount factor for the LoS rate. The LoS

rate expression has only one random term in (28) which is the interference that follows a normal

distribution. Subsequently, the rate is a convex function with respect to interference, and, hence,
using Jensen’s inequality CL(µI) ≤ E[CL(I)]. As a result, given that the transmission delay is a

concave function of the interference, the previous inequality sign is reciprocated. Consequently,

Next, we need to ﬁnd the variance of the transmission delay. Given that L is constant, and that

P (Λ) and CL are independent, according to the ﬁrst-order Taylor approximation:

Similarly to the ﬁrst moment, the rate squared as a function of interference is convex; using
Jensen’s inequality C 2
L(I)]. Consequently, the transmission delay squared is a

L(µI) ≤ E[C 2

concave function of the interference, this reciprocates the previous inequality. Hence,

of the total waiting time of Q1 as such, given that it is an M/M/1 queue: E[T 2

Moreover, to ﬁnd the second moment of Q2, we ﬁrst need to express the Laplace-Stieltjes

We can see that the only random term in (28) is the interference that is assumed to follow a
