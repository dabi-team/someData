Abstract – By a generalized bidirectional decomposition method, we obtain new Super-

luminal localized solutions to the wave equation (for the electromagnetic case, in particu-

lar) which are suitable for arbitrary frequency bands; several of them being endowed with

ﬁnite total energy. We construct, among the others, an inﬁnite family of generalizations

of the so-called “X-shaped” waves. Results of this kind may ﬁnd application in the other

ﬁelds in which an essential role is played by a wave-equation (like acoustics, seismology,

geophysics, gravitation, elementary particle physics, etc.).

1. – Introduction

Since many years it has been known that localized (non-dispersive) solutions exist to

the wave equation[1], endowed with subluminal or Superluminal[2] velocities.

Particular attention has been paid to the localized Superluminal solutions, which

seem to exist and propagate not only in vacuum but also in media with boundaries[3],

like normal-sized metallic waveguides[4] and possibly optical ﬁbers.

It is well known that such Superluminal Localized Solutions (SLS) have been experi-

mentally produced in acoustics[5], in optics[6] and recently in microwave physics[7].

However, all the analytical SLSs considered till now and known to us, with one ex-

ception[8], are superposition of Bessel beams with a frequency spectrum starting from

ν = 0 and suitable for low frequency regions. In this paper we shall set forth a new class

of SLSs with a spectrum beginning at any arbitrary frequency, and therefore well suited

for the construction also of high frequency (microwave, optical,...) pulses.

2. – “V -cone” variables: A generalized bidirectional expansion

Let us start from the axially symmetric solution (Bessel beam) to the wave equation

in cylindrical co-ordinates:

with the conditions

where J0 is the zeroth-order ordinary Bessel function, and where (as usual) kz is the
k⊥ is the wavenumber transverse
longitudinal component of the wavenumber while k

component magnitude. The second condition (2) excludes the non-physical solutions.

≡

It is essential to stress right now that the dispersion relation (2), with positive (but

2

not constant, a priori) k2 and real kz, while enforcing the consideration of the truly propa-
gating waves only (with exclusion of the evanescent ones), does allow for both subluminal

and Superluminal solutions!; the latter being the ones of interest here for us. Conditions

(2) correspond in the (ω, kz) plane to conﬁning ourselves to the sector shown in Fig.1;
that is, to the region delimited by the straight lines ω =

ckz.

A general, axially symmetric superposition of Bessel beams (with Φ′ as spectral weight-
function) will therefore be:

The base functions ψ(ρ, z, t) can be however rewritten as

The present procedure is a generalization of the so-called “bidirectional decomposi-

tion” technique[9], which was devised in the past for V = c.

The “V -cone” (shown in Fig.2a) corresponds in the (ω, kz) plane to the straight-lines
V kz = 0: that is, to the lines α = 0 and β = 0 (cf. Fig.2b); while conditions (2)

Inside the allowed region shown in Fig.1, we can choose for simplicity the sector delimited

by the straight-lines ω =

Let us observe that integrating over the intervals α, β

0 corresponds in eq.(3) to

≥
integrating over kz between
ω/V and +ω/V . But we shall choose in eq.(3) spectral
weights Φ′(ω, kz; k), and therefore spectral weights Φ(α, β; k) in eq.(3’) below, such as to
either eliminate or make negligible the contribution from the negative values of kz, that
is, from the backwards moving waves: thus curing from the start the problem met by

−

the “bidirectional decomposition” technique in connection with the so-called non-causal

components. Therefore, our SLSs will all be physical solutions.

Let us recall also that each Bessel beam is associated with an (“axicone”) angle θ,

linked to its speed by the relations[10]:

V /c) entering

−

eqs.(4b’),(4c’) are both negatives (since V > c). As a consequence, the inequalities (4b’)

and (4c’) result to be automatically satisﬁed: This means that we can actually choose

α > 0 and β > 0, as we did in eq.(3’).

In other words, the integration limits of our

eq.(3’) are contained by those discussed in connection with eq.(3), and are therefore ac-

ceptable. Indeed, they constitute a rather suitable choice for facilitating all the subsequent

integrations.

We shall now go on to constructing new Superluminal Localized Solutions for arbi-

trary frequencies, several of them possessing ﬁnite total energy.

In the simple case when β′ = 0, one completely dispenses with the “non-causal”
(backwards-moving) components of the bidirectional Fourier-type expansion (3’). For the

sake of clarity, let us go back to examining Fig.2b: The δ(β) factor in spectrum (7) does

actually imply the integrations over α and β in eq.(3’) to run along the α-line only; i.e.,

along the β = 0 straight-line (where ω = +V kz).
In this case, even more than in the
others, it is easy to verify that the group-velocity∗ of the present solution [cf. eq.(8) below]
V > 1. Let us, then, choose β′ = 0, and observe that for β = 0

In the present case, eq.(3’) can be easily integrated over β and k by having recourse to

∗Let us observe that the group velocity of the solutions considered in this paper can a priori be
evaluated through the ordinary, simple derivation of ω with respect to the wavenumber only for the
inﬁnite total energy solutions, as in the present case. However, for our SSP and SMPS solutions, below,
and in general for the ﬁnite total energy Superluminal solutions, the group-velocity cannot be calculated
through that simple relation, since in those cases it does not even exist a one-to-one function ω = ω(kz).

tics, and later on by others[12] in electromagnetism, once relations (6) are taken into

account. See Fig.3a.

Many other SLSs can be easily constructed; for instance, by inserting into the weight

function (7) the extra factor αm, namely Φ(α, β) = αm δ(β) exp[
aα], where m is a non-
negative integer, while it is still β′ = 0. Then an inﬁnite family of new SLSs is obtained
(for m

0), by using this time identity (6.621.4) of the same ref.[11]:

which is the ﬁrst derivative of the X-shaped wave, and is depicted in Fig.3b. One can

notice that, by increasing m, the pulse becomes more and more localized around its vertex.

All such pulses travel, however, without deforming.

Solution (8) is suited for low frequencies only, since its frequency spectrum (exponen-

tially decreasing) starts from zero. One can see this for instance by writing eq.(7) in the

(ω, kz) plane: by eqs.(4) one obtains

Φ(ω, kz) = δ

By contrast, when the factor αm is present, the frequency spectrum of the solutions
can be “bumped” in correspondence with any value ωM of the angular frequency, provided
that m is large [or a/V is small]: in fact, ωM results to be ωM = mV /a. The spectrum,
then, is shifted towards higher frequencies (and decays only beyond the value ωM).

Moreover, let us mention here that also in the spectra of the following pulses (consid-
ered in subsections 3.2 and 3.3 below) one can insert the αm factor; in fact, in correspon-

dence with the spectrum

Φ(α, β) = αm Φ0(β) e−aα ,

(7’)

one obtains as further solutions the m-th order derivatives of the basic (m = 0) solution

below considered. This is due to the circumstance that our integrations over α (as in

eq.(3’)) are always Laplace-type transformations. We shall not write them down explicitly,

however, for the sake of conciseness.

Diﬀerent SLSs can be obtained also by modifying (still with β′ = 0) the spectrum (7).

Some interesting solutions are reported in Appendix A.

Let us now construct SLSs more suited for high frequencies (always conﬁning our-

selves to pulses well localized not only longitudinally, but also transversely).

We are going now to build up suitable superpositions of ΨSFWM(ρ, ζ, η) in order to get
ﬁnite total energy pulses, in analogy with what is currently attempted[16] for the c-speed

FWMs.

3.3 – The Superluminal “Splash Pulses” (SSP).

In the case of the c-speed FWMs, in ref.[16] suitable superpositions of them were

proposed (the SPs and the “MPS pulses”) which possess ﬁnite total energy (even without

truncating them).

Let us analogously go on from our solutions (13) to ﬁnite total energy solutions, by

integrating our SFWMs (13) over β′ :

Let us repeat that our SSPs have ﬁnite total energy, as one can easily verify; we shall

come back to this result also from a geometric point of view. They however get deformed

while traveling, and their amplitude decreases with time: see Figs.6a and 6b.

It is worth

mentioning that, due to the form (7”) of the SSP spectrum, our solution (17) can be

regarded as the ﬁnite energy version of the classical X-shaped solution.

3.4 – The Superluminal “Modiﬁed Power Spectrum” (SMPS) pulses.

In connection with eq.(15), let us now go on to a more general choice for the weight-

in which the integration over β runs now from β0 (no longer from zero) to inﬁnity.

It is worthwhile to emphasize that our solutions (18), like solutions (17), possess a
ﬁnite total energy.§ Even if this is easily veriﬁed, let us address the question from an
illuminating geometric point of view. Let us add that their amplitude too (as for the

SSPs) decreases with time: see Figs.7a and 7b.

With reference to Fig.8, let us observe that the inﬁnite total energy solutions X, in

eq.(12), and SFWM, in eq.(13), correspond to integrations along the β = 0 axis (i.e., the

α-axis) and the β = β0 straight-line, respectively; that is to say, correspond to a delta
factor, δ(β

β0), in the spectrum (7), where β′

In order to go on to the ﬁnite total energy solutions (SMPS), eq.(18), we replaced the

delta factor with the function (16’), which is zero in the region above the β = β0 line,
while it decays[17] in the region below (as well as along) such a line. The same procedure

was followed by us for the solutions SSP, eq.(17), which correspond to the particular case

β0 = 0. The faster the spectrum decay takes place in the region below the β = β0 line

It seems important to stress also that, while the X and SSP solutions, eqs.(12) and (18),

mainly consist in low-frequency (Bessel) beams, on the contrary our solutions SFWM and

SMPS, eqs.(13) and (18), can be constituted by higher frequency beams (corresponding,

namely, to ω

V β0). This property can be exploited for constructing SLSs in the mi-

crowave or optics ﬁelds, by suitable choices of the V and β0 values.

§One should recall that the ﬁrst ﬁnite energy solution, the MFXW, diﬀerent from but analogous to

our one, appeared as eq.(4.6) in ref.[14].

¶The “depth of ﬁeld” is the distance along which the pulse (approximately) keeps its shape, besides

its group-velocity; cf. refs.[16,2].

(19c)

One can realize that constraint (19c), which followed from the wave equation, is compat-

ible with constraint (20).

Relation (20) is important, since it clariﬁes the “spectral origin” of the various local-

ized solutions introduced in the past literature (e.g., for v = c), which originated from

superpositions performed either by running “along” the straight-lines (20) themselves, or

in terms of spectral weights favouring ω, kz values not far from lines (20). In particular, in
V > c, relation (20) brings in a formal further support of our pro-
our case, in which v

cedures, as stated in Figs.2, 4 and 8. One may also notice that, when the pulse spectrum

does strictly obey eq.(20), the pulse depth of ﬁeld is inﬁnite (for instance, the classical

X-shaped wave and the SFWM can be regarded as corresponding to eq.(20) with n = 0
and n = 1, respectively.k While, when the spectrum is only (well) localized in the (ω, kz)
plane, near one of the lines (20), the corresponding pulse has a ﬁnite ﬁeld depth (as it is

the case for our SSP and SMPS solutions). The more “localized” the pulse spectrum is,

in the (ω, kz) plane, in the vicinity of a line (20), the longer the pulse ﬁeld depth will be.
We shall investigate all these points more in detail, in the next subsection.

5. – Some exact (Superluminal localized) solutions, and their ﬁeld depth

To inquiring more in detail into the ﬁeld depth of our SLSs, we can conﬁne ourselves

to the propagation straight-line ρ = 0. Then, we can ﬁnd exact analytic solutions holding
for any value of β′, without having to assume β′ to be small, as we had on the contrary
to assume for the SFWM, the SST and the SMPS solutions (see Sect.3, subsections 1, 2,

3). In fact, one is confronted with a simple integration of the type

Let us ﬁrst study the inﬁnite total energy solutions: namely, our SFWMs (skipping the

generalized X-type solutions).

5.1 – The case of the Superluminal Focus Wave Modes.

In the case of the SFWMs, solution (11) may be integrated for ρ = 0, without imposing

the small β0 ≡

Due to the linearity of the wave equation, both the real and the imaginary part of

eq.(11a), as well as of all our (complex) solutions, are themselves solutions of the wave

equation.

In the following we shall conﬁne ourselves to investigating the behaviour of

the real part.

In the case of eq.(11a) it is

Re [ΨSFWM(ρ = 0, ζ, η)] =

a cos(β0η) + ζ sin(β0η)
a2 + ζ 2

.

(11b)

The center C of such a pulse (where the pulse reaches its maximum value, M, oscillating

in space and time) corresponds to z = V t, that is, to ζ = 0 and η = 2z; its value being

MSFWM =

cos(2β0z)

.

(11c)

Notice that:

(i) at C one meets the maximum value M of the whole three-dimensional

pulse:

(ii) quantity M is a periodic function of z (and t), with “wavelength” ∆z0 (and

oscillation period ∆t0) given by

∗∗Also in the case of the SMPS pulses, below, we shall arrive at analytical solutions without any need

of imposing the condition that β0 ≡

β′ be small.

(11d)

respectively: in agreement with what anticipated in subsect.4.2-B.

The delta function entering our spectrum (7), entailing that β = β0, requires that

ω = V kz + 2V β0

(22)

which is nothing but the straight-line β = β0 of Fig.8; this fact implying by the way (as
we already saw) and inﬁnite ﬁeld depth, in accordance with the previous considerations

in subsect.3.4.

By comparing eq.(22) with the important “localization constraint” (20), with n = 1,

we just obtain the value ∆z0 of eq.(11d). In other words, the previously got relations
(11d) are exactly what needed for the localization properties (non-dispersiveness) of our

SFWMs.

Finally, let us examine the longitudinal localization of our oscillating beams. For

simplicity, let us analyse the “dispersion” of the beam when its amplitude is maximal;

let us therefore skip considering the oscillations and go on to the pulse magnitude: one
gets for the pulse half-height full-width the value D = 2√3a in the case of the magnitude
itself, and

D = 2a

(23)

in the case of the square magnitude. Let us adhere to the latter choice in the following,

due to a widespread use.

5.2 – The ﬁnite total energy solutions.

Let us now go on to the ﬁnite total energy solutions:

19

one has to insert into eq.(3’ ’) the spectrum (7’ ’), namely Φ = exp[

Let us explicitly observe that the chosen spectrum, by virtue of eqs.(4), entails that

these solutions (17a,b) do not oscillate, which correspond to ∆z0 → ∞
eqs.(20):

in agreement with what anticipated in subsect.4.2-C. Actually, the SSPs are

and ∆t0 → ∞

in

the ﬁnite energy version of the classical X-shaped pulses.

The maximum value M of eq.(17b) (a not oscillating, but slowly decaying only, solu-

tion) still corresponds to putting z = V t, that is, to setting ζ = 0 and η = 2z:

localization in the surroundings of the straight-line ω = V kz: Cf. also subsect.3.3.

At last, the longitudinal localization will be approximately given by

D

2a ;

(25)

namely, it is still given (for a

1 and b

1) by eq.(23). Notice that, since solution

(17a) does not oscillate, the same will be true for its real part, eq.(17b), as well as for the

square magnitude of eq.(17a): as it can be straightforwardly veriﬁed. Of course, equation

(25) holds for t = 0. During the pulse propagation, the longitudinal localization D seems

to increase, while the amplitude M decreases. Indeed, our preliminary calculations have

veriﬁed that the D-increase rate is approximately equal to the M-decrease rate; so much

so we obtain (practically) the same ﬁeld depth, eq.(24), when requesting the longitudinal

localization to suﬀer a limited increase (e.g., by 10% only).

b) The case of the Superluminal Modiﬁed Power Spectrum pulses — In the case of

the SMPS pulses with ρ = 0, one has to insert into eq.(3’ ’) the spectrum (7’ ’ ’), namely
Φ = e−aα e−b(β−β0), with β

β0. By integration, one gets

≥

ΨSMPS(ρ = 0, ζ, η) = e−iβ0η [(a

iζ)(b + iη)]−1 ,

−

(18a)

whose real part is easily evaluated. These pulses do oscillate while traveling. Their ﬁeld

depth, then calculated by having recourse to the pulse square magnitude, happens still

to be

ZSMPS =

b
6

(26)

like in the SSP case. Even the longitudinal localization of the square amplitude results

approximately given, for t = 0, by

D

≈

2a

(27)

as in the previous cases.

The ﬁeld depth (26) depends only on b. However, the behaviour of the propagating

pulse changes with the β0-value change, besides with b’s. Let us examine the maximum
amplitude of the real part of eq.(18a), which for z = V t writes (when ζ = 0 and η = 2z):

MSFWM =

1
ab

cos(2β0z) + 2[z/b] sin(2β0z)
1 + 4[z/b]2

.

(18b)

21

Initially, for z = 0, t = 0, one has M = (ab)−1 like in the SSP case.

From eq.(18b) one can infer that:

(i) when z/b

≪

1, namely, when z < Z, eq.(18b) becomes

MSMPS ≃

cos(2β0z)
ab

,

[for z < Z]

(28)

and the pulse does actually oscillate harmonically with wavelength ∆z0 = π/β0 and
period ∆t0 = π/(V β0), all along its ﬁeld depth: In agreement with what anticipated in
subsect.4.2-D.

(ii) when z/b > 1, namely, when z > Z, eq.(18b) becomes

MSMPS ≃

sin(2β0z)
ab

1
2 [z/b]

[for z > Z]

(28’)

Therefore, beyond its depth of ﬁeld, the pulse go on oscillating with the same ∆z0, but
its maximum amplitude decays proportionally to z (the decay coeﬃcient being b/2).

Last but not least, let us add the observation that results of this kind may ﬁnd ap-

plication in the other ﬁelds in which an essential role is played by a wave-equation (like

acoustics, seismology, geophysics, relativistic quantum physics, gravitational waves).

Let us recall that, due to the choice β′ = 0 and the consequent presence of a δ(β) factor
in the weight, all such solutions are completely physical, in the sense that they e don’t get

any contribution from the non-causal components (i.e., from waves moving backwards).

In fact, these new solutions are functions of ρ, ζ only (and not of η).

In particular,

solutions (A.2b), (A.2c), (A.2d), as well as others easily obtainable, are functions of ρ

via quantity X only. This may suggest to go on from the variables (ρ, ζ) to the variables

(X, ζ) and write down em the wave equation itself in the new variables: Some related

results and consequences will be exploited elsewhere.

which generalize the classical X-shaped solution; the Fig.3b depicts the ﬁrst of them (its

ﬁrst derivative) with the same parameters: see the text and eq.(10). The successsive

solutions in such a family are more and more localized around their vertex. Quantity ρ

by choosing small values of a. This can be even more easily seen in the (ω, kz) plane.

[17] The relaxation of the spectral delta correlation has been discussed (even if for a dif-

ferent set of coordinates, i.e., over a diﬀerent plane) also in the paragraphs associated

with eqs.(3.5),(3.6) in A.M.Shaarawi: J. Opt. Soc. Am. A14 (1997) 1804-1816, and with

eqs.(4.2),(4.3) in A.M.Shaarawi, I.M.Besieris, R.W.Ziolkowski and R.M.Sedky: J. Opt.

Soc. Am. A12 (1995) 1954-1964; while the need for a relaxation of that kind in order to

get ﬁnite energy solutions was mentioned (as we already said) in ref.[14], besides ref.[18].
