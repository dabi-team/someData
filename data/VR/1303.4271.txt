ABSTRACT

Context. The measurement of the Sun’s surface motions with a high spatial and temporal resolution is still a challenge.
Aims. We wish to validate horizontal velocity measurements all over the visible disk of the Sun from Solar Dynamics Observatory/
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) data.
Methods. Horizontal velocity ﬁelds are measured by following the proper motions of solar granules using a newly developed version
of the Coherent Structure Tracking (CST) code. The comparison of the surface ﬂows measured at high spatial resolution (Hinode, 0.1
arcsec) and low resolution (SDO/HMI, 0.5 arcsec) allows us to determine corrections to be applied to the horizontal velocity measured
from HMI white light data.
Results. We derive horizontal velocity maps with spatial and temporal resolutions of respectively 2.5 Mm and 30 min. From the
two components of the horizontal velocity vx and vy measured in the sky plane and the simultaneous line of sight component from
SDO/HMI dopplergrams vD, we derive the spherical velocity components (vr, vθ, vϕ). The azimuthal component vϕ gives the solar
diﬀerential rotation with a high precision (±0.037 km s−1) from a temporal sequence of only three hours.
Conclusions. By following the proper motions of the solar granules, we can revisit the dynamics of the solar surface at high spatial
and temporal resolutions from hours to months and years with the SDO data.

1. Introduction

The dynamics of the Sun’s surface is one of the major elements
in understanding the time evolution of its magnetic activity. It is
a real challenge to measure the surface motions at all spatial and
temporal scales and compare them to those coming from the sim-
ulations. Recently, the HMI instrument aboard the SDO satellite
allowed us a new step in that direction. By following the proper
motions of the solar granules, representative of solar plasma evo-
lution, it is possible to deﬁne the ﬂow ﬁeld on the solar surface
(Roudier et al. 2012) from a small spatial scale of 2.5 Mm up
to nearly 85% of the solar radius (Fig. 6 of that paper). We mea-
sured the velocities in a cartesian coordinate system, where x and
y denote the coordinates in the sky plane with x parallel to the
direction of the solar rotation and z directed towards the observer
along the line of sight. Beyond 0.85 R⊙, the vx and vy compo-
nents appeared to be noisy, but the vx component showed a trend
indicative of the solar rotation. In order to identify whether im-
provements could be made in the determination of the horizontal
velocities beyond that limit, we used simultaneous observations

of the Sun in white light at low (SDO/HMI) and high (Hinode)
spatial resolution.

In this paper, we describe a comparison between velocity
ﬁelds projected on the sky plane that are obtained in the south
pole region with Hinode data and SDO/HMI data using the CST
code (Rieutord et al. 2007; Roudier et al. 2012). In the next sec-
tion we discuss the corrections done in order to get an accurate
velocity close to the solar limb. From the vx, vy and Doppler ob-
servations, we describe the transformation to the local surface
velocities vr, vθ, vϕ. Finally, we present an application to mea-
sure solar diﬀerential rotation with a short time sequence (3h)
up to high latitudes with low noise. Discussion and conclusions
follow.

2. Observations

2.1. Hinode observations

We used data sets from the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT),
onboard the Hinode 1 mission (e.g., Suematsu et al. 2008;
Ichimoto et al. 2004). The SOT has a 50 cm primary mirror with
a spatial resolution of about 0.2′′at a wavelength of 550 nm. For
our study, we used blue continuum observations at 450.45 nm.
from the Hinode/SOT BFI (Broadband Filter Imager). The ob-
servations were recorded continuously on December 10, 2011,
from 16:11:33 to 19:07:05 UT. To get the limb as reference,
the south pole was observed at the position reported in the
Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) header of Hinode, i.e,
Xcent = −10.08′′ and Ycent = −969.84′′. The time step was 45
sec and the ﬁeld of view was 111.6 ′′ × 111.6 ′′ with a pixel size
of 0 .′′1089. After alignment, the useful ﬁeld of view reduced to
104′′ × 82′′. To remove the eﬀects of the oscillations, we applied
a subsonic Fourier ﬁlter. This ﬁlter was deﬁned by a cone in k-ω
space, where k and ω are spatial and temporal frequencies. All
Fourier components such that ω/k ≥ Vcut−oﬀ = 7 km s−1 were re-
moved so as to keep only convective motions (Title et al. 1989).

2.2. SDO/HMI observations

The HMI (Scherrer et al. 2012; Schou et al. 2012) onboard the
Solar SDO provides uninterrupted observations over the entire
disk. This gives a unique opportunity for mapping surface ﬂows
on various scales (spatial and temporal). Using the SDO/HMI
white light data on December 10, 2011, from 16:11:15 to
19:06:45 UT, we derived horizontal velocity ﬁelds from im-
age granulation tracking using the newly developed version of
the CST code (Roudier et al. 2012). The time step was 45 sec-
onds with a pixel size of 0.′′5. The solar diﬀerential rotation dis-
cussed in Sect. 6 was determined from SDO/HMI white light and
Doppler data taken on August 30, 2010 from 8:00:45 to 11:09:45
UT.

operated by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) in coopera-
tion with NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and
ESA (European Space Agency).

3. Hinode south pole ﬂow ﬁeld

Measuring the solar rotation near the poles is a diﬃcult task be-
cause there are few solar structures at high latitudes suitable for
tracking. However, the Hinode images allow us to follow so-
lar granules with good contrast up to the solar limb. First, we
compare results of two methods to measure the solar motion
close to the south pole using Hinode observations: local cor-
relation tracking (LCT) (November & Simon 1988) and CST
(Rieutord et al. 2007; Roudier et al. 2012). Both methods track
the horizontal motions of granules in the ﬁeld of view. More pre-
cisely, the LCT method of obtaining the horizontal velocity uses
a spatial window that simultaneously accounts for the solar gran-
ules and integranular structures and may cover several granules.
In contrast, the CST method measures the velocities by follow-
ing the trajectory of each granule, i.e., solar plasma, during the
life of the coherent object, which is deﬁned by its appearance and
disappearance if the granule does not split or merge. The data
were aligned and the P angle evolution corrected by 0.018◦/hour
in order to get a perfect co-alignment with SDO data used in the
following. On December 10, 2011, the B0 angle was −0.25◦,
resulting in insigniﬁcant projection eﬀects with a negligible evo-
lution during the observation period. Figure 1 shows good agree-
ment of the vx component from the LCT and CST up to latitude
75◦. Close to the limb, the eﬀect of the spatial window used in
the LCT prevents correct velocity determination. Figure 2 gives
a solar sidereal rotation rate close to the pole of around 11◦/day,
which corresponds to a polar period of 32.73 days. This is in
agreement with previous determinations (Beck 2000).

4. Comparison of the velocities from SDO and

Hinode

Our main goal is to compare the surface ﬂows measured with
a high spatial resolution (Hinode, 0.1′′) and a low resolution
(SDO, 0.5′′). We extracted the same ﬁeld of view from the SDO
data set as the Hinode one and performed a very precise co-
alignment of both sequences. To get the best co-alignment, the
south polar region was observed and the solar limb was taken as
an absolute reference. An additional check was performed after
the alignment process by locating the brightest features (facular
points) at the beginning and end of both sequences (Hinode and
SDO). A very good match of the structures indicated very good

ities, which were also k-ω ﬁltered. Figure 7 still shows good
agreement for the vx component and, in the same way, for the
siderial angular rotation, at the latitudes up to 78◦. The oﬀset of
0.4 km s−1 observed in vy component of the Hinode data at 0.5′′
is clearly visible in Fig. 7. We conclude that the oﬀset is caused
by the combination of the lower spatial resolution and decreas-
ing contrast to the limb. One has to bear in mind that we only
observe the south pole region in detail, where vy is practically
identical to the radial component of the ﬂow. Thus, our observa-
tion can be generalized so that the radial component is always
aﬀected by the oﬀset and we can correct for it. Indeed, diﬀerent
processes play a role in generating that radial component: at very
high heliocentric angles, one pixel covers several granules. The
granule part close to the limb is of lower contrast: it tends to be
lost in the segmented images. This introduces an artiﬁcial radial
motion of some granules that we see as the oﬀset in the vy com-
ponent on the central meridian when comparing high-resolution
(Hinode) and low-resolution (SDO) measurements. This radial
eﬀect was previously observed in our measurements, but its ori-
gin was not identiﬁed. Since we now have the origin of that error,
we can measure it and correct for it all over the Sun. One way to
get the radial oﬀset is to average the radial velocity component
over a circle centered on the solar disk. Due to the B0 angle, the
radial correction is not necessarily symmetrical in the northern
and southern hemispheres of the Sun. This is why we treat the
average process in the northern and southern regions of the Sun
separately. Figure 8 shows, for example, the plot of the measured
average radial component in the southern part and the overplot-
ted ﬁt obtained by using a polynomial function of the ﬁfth de-
gree. Figure 9 shows the entire proﬁle of the correction of the
radial velocity to be applied to the velocities vx and vy all over
the Sun (north and south), allowing a good representation of the
velocity ﬁeld around 90% of the solar radius. In the following,
this correction is applied systematically to all velocity ﬁelds.

alignment of both sequences during the 3 hours. We then ap-
plied the CST to both sequences to get the horizontal velocities
(vx and vy) over the entire ﬁeld of view. Figures 4 and 6 show
a good agreement up to 78◦of southern latitude. This indicates
that SDO observations can be used to determine the solar rota-
tion in the central meridian region up to signiﬁcantly high lati-
tudes. However, as shown in Fig. 5, the meridional component
measured on SDO data exhibits an oﬀset of 0.4 km s−1 relative
to the Hinode component, which was used as the reference (be-
cause the velocity is close to zero at the limb). Figure 5 shows a
good correspondence between Hinode and SDO velocities when
the 0.4 km s−1 oﬀset is removed (curve marked as SDO−0.4).
We tried to elucidate the origin of that oﬀset by determining all
possible errors as listed in Table II of Strous (2000). The esti-
mation on the SDO measurement gives a total error on the vy
component of around 0.034 km s−1, which is ten times smaller
than the measured oﬀset.

As described above, one of the major diﬀerences between
the two sequences is the pixel size, which is 0.1′′ and 0.5′′ for
Hinode and SDO, respectively. In order to analyze the sequences
under the same conditions, we degraded the pixel size of the
Hinode observation to the SDO one: 0.5′′. We then applied CST
to the Hinode degraded sequence to get the horizontal veloc-

From the velocity components vx and vy measured in the sky
plane and the simultaneous line of sight velocity vD measured
from the SDO/HMI dopplergrams (e.g., Fig. 11), we can de-
rive the spherical velocity components vr, vθ, vϕ, projected onto
spherical coordinates r, θ, ϕ using

vr(θ, ϕ) = cos θ ∗ sin ϕ ∗ vx

+ (sin θ ∗ cos B0 − cos θ ∗ cos ϕ ∗ sin B0) ∗ vy
+ (cos θ ∗ cos ϕ ∗ cos B0 + sin θ ∗ sin B0) ∗ vDop

vθ(θ, ϕ) = − sin θ ∗ sin ϕ ∗ vx

+ (sin θ ∗ cos ϕ ∗ sin B0 + cos θ ∗ cos B0) ∗ vy
+ (cos θ ∗ sin B0 − sin θ ∗ cos ϕ ∗ cos B0) ∗ vDop

vϕ(θ, ϕ) = cos ϕ ∗ vx

+ sin ϕ ∗ sin B0 ∗ vy
− sin ϕ ∗ cos B0 ∗ vDop

The system of coordinates is also shown in Fig. 10. We note
that ϕ is along the longitude and θ is along the latitude. The co-
alignment of all components has been checked carefully by us-
ing the information from FITS headers of the SDO data. Before
using the dopplergrams, some data reduction had to be applied.

First, the dopplergrams were averaged over the same time inter-
val as the vx and vy sequence, here three hours. The limbshift had
to be be corrected (Ulrich 2010) and, in this case, we used the
limbshift function determined by the SDO team over the month
of August 2010 (P. Scherrer, private communication).

By deﬁning z = 1 − cos ρ, where ρ is heliocentric angle,
the limb-shift correction (in km s−1) is given by limb-shift(z) =
−0.664z + 0.775z2 + 0.284z3. The mean velocity of the central
region of the dopplergrams was taken as zero origin. The dopp-
lergrams were resampled to the same size as the vx and vy com-
ponents.

This correction depends on the P angle as

On August 30, 2010, it was 0.13 km s−1 on vx and 0.04 km s−1
on vy, where ve is the Earth velocity component projected on the
Sun’s surface.

Figure 12 shows the resulting velocities vr, vθ, vϕ for the
three-hour sequence on August 30, 2010. The vr map exhibits the
radial component where the downﬂow is visible in the sunspot
regions. Close to disk center we observe a lower contrast of vr,
due to the low contrast in Doppler velocity in this part of the
Sun because of the mostly horizontal ﬂow on the Sun’s surface.
The vr component is not well determined close to the limb be-
cause the projection eﬀects are predominant. The vϕ component
clearly shows the solar diﬀerential rotation with a lower velocity
close to the pole. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that we
can measure and visualize the solar diﬀerential rotation with a
three-hour time sequence. The latitudinal component vθ map al-

lows us to essentially observe motion on supergranulation scales
with a comparatively short time sequence.

6. Determination of the solar differential rotation

One of the ﬁrst scientiﬁc applications of the CST algorithm on
SDO/HMI data described in Roudier et al. (2012) was to deter-
mine the solar rotation from the granule displacements. From the
longitudinal velocity component vϕ, it is possible to calculate the
solar diﬀerential rotation. In order to reduce the noise, we aver-
age vϕ over bands in longitudes. Figure 13 shows the computed
diﬀerential rotation averaged over bands limited to longitude of
(−2, 2), (−10, 10), (−20, 20), (−40, 40) degrees. The overplot-
ted continuous line represents the solar rotation measured by
the spectroscopic method (Howard & Harvey 1970), which is
our reference to evaluate the noise of our measurements. The
noise level is found to be 0.94, 0.37, 0.27, 0.267 ◦/day for the
set of above-mentioned longitudinal bands. Thus, the average

equatorial solar rotation determined for these four bands around
the central meridian is 1.99 km s−1 ± (0.133, 0.052, 0.038,
0.037) km s−1 for the diﬀerent longitudinal bands.

Our results show that, for the ﬁrst time, using the CST we can
get a determination of the solar rotation with a time sequence as
short as three hours at very high precision, namely, 1.9% in the
best case.

7. Discussion and conclusion

The comparison between high and low spatial resolution obser-
vations from the Hinode and SDO satellites allowed us to quan-
tify the quality of the horizontal velocities determined over the
full Sun. We found that the diﬀerential rotation along the central
meridian is well determined up to latitude 60◦. With a longer
time series, higher latitudes will be reached on depending the
B0 angle. Comparison of the meridional components shows an
oﬀset of 0.4 km s−1 due to a combination of three factors: the

low spatial resolution, the limb gradient contrast, and the seg-
mentation process. However, we describe a way to measure and
correct for the radial eﬀect all over the Sun and get nearly a full
Sun velocity measurement. From the velocities vx and vy mea-
sured in the sky plane and the simultaneous line of sight velocity
from SDO/HMI dopplergrams, we derived the spherical veloc-
ity components (vr, vθ, vϕ). From the longitudinal component, it
is possible to get the solar diﬀerential rotation with high preci-
sion ( ±0.037 km s−1) using a temporal sequence of only three
hours. This is remarkable because other methods require at least
one month of data. That particularity opens a new ﬁeld of study
of the solar rotation and motions over the solar surface. In this
way, we can revisit the dynamics of the solar surface at high spa-
tial and temporal resolution from hours to months and years with
the SDO data. In particular, it will be of great interest to com-
pare CST convective velocities with numerical simulations and
constraints from helioseismology (Gizon & Birch 2012) .
