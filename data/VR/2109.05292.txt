ABSTRACT
Myopia is an eye condition that makes it difficult for people to
focus on faraway objects. It has become one of the most serious
eye conditions worldwide and negatively impacts the quality of life
of those who suffer from it. Although myopia is prevalent, many
non-myopic people have misconceptions about it and encounter
challenges empathizing those who suffer from it. In this research,
we developed two virtual reality (VR) games, (1) "Myopic Bike" and
(2) "Say Hi", to provide a means for the non-myopic population

to experience the difficulties of myopic people. Our two games
simulate two inconvenient daily life scenarios (riding a bicycle and
greeting friends on the street) that myopic people encounter when
not wearing glasses. The goal is to facilitate empathy in people
with non-myopia for those who suffer from myopia. We evaluated
four participants’ game experiences through questionnaires and
semi-structured interviews. Overall, our two VR games can create
an engaging and non-judgmental experience for the non-myopic
people that has potential to facilitate empathizing with those who
suffer from myopia.

1 INTRODUCTION
Myopia (or nearsightedness) is a common vision condition with
which people can see nearby objects clearly but the further-away
ones are blurry [29]. Myopia happens when the shape of an eye
causes light rays to bend (refract) incorrectly, focusing images in
front of the retina instead of on the retina [29]. In general, low
myopia is less than 3.0 diopters (<-3.0 D), moderate myopia is less
than 6.0 diopters (-3.0 D to -6.0 D), and high myopia is usually
greater than 6.0 diopters (>-6.0 D).

Myopia is one of the most common eye problems worldwide. For
example, approximately 600 million residents in China are suffering
from myopia [53] and 4% of the population in the United States
are suffering from high myopia [41]. For non-myopic people, it is
often difficult to empathize with different levels of myopia, and
as such, it can be challenging to feel the distress and discomfort
experienced by those who have it [4]. We believe that the lack
of empathy toward the population with myopia could result in
inadequate considerations when designing products for myopic
people and inadvertently cause accessibility problems.

Recently, virtual reality (VR) games has shown great potential
as a medium to foster empathy in a non-judgemental but engaging
and fun way [39]. VR can offer players an embodied first-person
perspective to experience different severities of myopia throguh
the use of a virtual environment [2]. Unlike traditional displays
on mobile phones or monitors, VR gives the user a depth experi-
ence, bringing the most visual-based and non-tactile feedback in
such non-existent scenarios [26], which iempathy with patients
experiencings beneficial for scenario simulation and immersive
experience.

The use of extended reality to study health issues is not new.
For example, Xu et al. [51] designed a variety of VR exergames in
seated or standing postures using head-mounted displays (HMDs).
Likewise, Xu and colleagues [52] designed a high-intensity interval
training (HIIT) boxing VR game that allowed players to achieve high
heart rates and exertion, rapid fat burning, and reduced exercise
time with high intensity.

In this research, we explore the design of VR games that are
aimed to foster in non-myopic people empathy toward those around
us who suffer from myopia. To do this, we first collected opinions
from eight myopic and two non-myopic people through a survey.
We then investigated and studied the potential risks encountered
by myopic people when not wearing glasses. After, we developed
two VR myopic games, Myopic Bike and Say Hi (Figure 1). We
then recruited four participants with three levels of myopia to
evaluate the two games. We collected their feedback through semi-
structured interviews and questionnaires. These findings suggested
that these two VR games represent a good balance between having
an engaging game experience and developing empathetic feelings
toward people with myopia. Overall, the results of our research
suggest that VR games are a promising approach to foster empathy
toward myopic people.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Facilitating Empathy
One common definition of empathy is "the ability to perceive, un-
derstand, and respond to the experiences and behaviors of others"
[46]. According to Davis [8], empathy is manifested in three aspects:
(1) physical sensations, (2) emotional sensations, and (3) cognitive
awareness. As VR can provide users with an embodied and im-
mersive experience [6], it is a suitable and powerful platform to
foster empathy toward those with physical and visual disorders or
challenges [12].

Researchers have been using videogames and VR environments
to foster empathy toward specific populations [15, 21, 22, 44]. Their
findings suggest that VR games can elicit a strong sense of em-
bodied empathy because of VR’s immersive nature [11, 31, 32, 39].
Furthermore, the immersive features of VR games can also provide
benefits to individuals’ perceptions and behaviors [5, 17, 27, 43].
Bailenson et al. [17] found that two experiential aspects of VR,
immersion and embodiment, play an essential role in fostering em-
pathy. Similarly, Tong and colleagues [20, 47] designed a VR game
named AS IF, and found that it promoted empathy toward chronic
pain patients through an embodied avatar and game tasks. They
identified the critical role of embodiment in eliciting people’s empa-
thetic attitudes. Although previous studies have explored empathy
toward vulnerable populations, our study targets a unique group,
people with different levels of myopia.

2.2 Accessibility Designs for Visual

Impairments

Prior research on the accessibility design for those with visual im-
pairments in VR has focused on blindness [14, 28, 33, 34], guidance
systems [25, 36, 37, 48–50, 55, 56], and non-visual interfaces [1, 40].
Researchers also explored haptic interaction techniques for people
with visual impairments [19, 42, 54]. Krosl et al. [23] simulated the

Figure 2: Four conditions in Myopic Bike. We engaged three groups of users with different degrees of myopia (low, moderate
and high myopia), two from each group, in a pre-experiment data collection survey to help frame the design of the games
and, based on their feedback, we adjusted the Gaussian blur parameters to match the real-world myopic situations as much
as possible, which are 0, 1, 2 and 3 (Figures 2.1 - 2.4, respectively).

perspective of a person suffering from cataracts in AR to foster
empathy with patients experiencing. Prior work contributed tech-
niques that are useful for blind people or low vision populations.
Our two games focus on fostering empathy toward people with
severe myopia from those without myopia or with low or moderate
myopic conditions. We believe that it is only by truly experiencing
simulated difficulties of varying degrees of myopia that we can
truly achieve empathy and thus have a deeper awareness of their
challenges and ultimately provide improved accessibility designs
for myopic users.

3 MYOPIC GAMES
3.1 Background
Benford et al. introduced the concept of "uncomfortable interaction"
[3, 4], which explores the benefits and unexplored potential interests
of uncomfortable user experience in games. Our work falls under
the category of uncomfortable interaction from the perspective of
the players’ experience to deliver an entertaining and fun but also
enlightening and socially bonding experience [4], specifically in
the context of experiencing how myopic people feel about doing
common daily activities.

We first collected myopic people’s challenges in their daily lives
and non-myopic people’s perceptions of these challenges through
an online survey. We received a total of 10 responses (6 males and
4 females with an average age of 27 years), 8 from myopic people
(7 with moderate myopia in both eyes and 1 with low myopia in
both eyes) and 2 responses from non-myopic people.

Nine participants had prior some experience with VR devices.
Eight myopic people reported that if they forget to wear glasses in

their daily lives, they would be afraid of riding a bicycle because
they could not see any obstacles on their way. Six thought they
would be afraid of greeting people on the street because they could
not recognize them. The other two non-myopic respondents also
mentioned that they thought myopic people would be afraid to
use transportation and greet people because of any embarrassing
situation if they could not recognize them. Based on these initial
findings, we decided to design the two myopia games, one for each
scenario, i.e., Myopic Bike and Say Hi.

3.2 Innovations
Our two games have three innovative features. First, our targeted au-
dience are people and people with low to medium myopia. Second,
we provided four game levels, each mapped to a level of myopia, for
players to choose from to experience different degrees of myopic
situations. Third, our two VR games simulated challenges people
with myopia encounter in their daily life.

3.3 Myopic Bike
3.3.1 Game Concepts and Gameplay Mechanics. Myopic Bike of-
fers four levels of myopia for players to choose from (NoMyopia,
LowMyopia, ModerateMyopia and HighMyopia) (Fig. 2). Users play
a person with myopia riding a bike. Players need to reach the end
of the route with roadblocks (Fig. 3.1). There are three levels of
difficulty for each of the four myopia conditions according to the
number of roadblocks along the route (i.e., 40, 60, 80). Thus, players
need to be skilled at handling and maneuvering the bike to avoid
hitting the roadblocks and to not losing points. We also provide

group, the game will show either one or no person from the four
faces. Players need to select the one they know from all pedestri-
ans before they disappear (Fig. 4.1). The selected pedestrian will
provide positive or negative audio feedback after the player made
a choice. Players’ performances will be shown on a scoreboard (Fig.
4.2) when they complete the game.

We predefined the number of groups in each round and the
number of groups without any acquaintance (i.e., 20 and 4 in our
game). Moreover, for each group, pedestrians’ clothes and faces are
randomly allocated. There are three difficulty levels , the higher the
level, the more pedestrians are on the road (i.e., 1 per level in our
game).

3.5 Development and Apparatus
We used the Unity1 to develop the two myopic games and Ocu-
lus Rift S2 as the VR HMD. All development and evaluation were
conducted at a university’s research lab.

We recruited four participants from a local university, each from
a unique condition of myopia (including the non-myopic condition),
i.e., NoMyopia, LowMyopia, ModerateMyopia, and HighMyopia.
We collected their feedback from pre-prepared questionnaires, i.e.,
Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Although some studies
have questioned the validity of the GEQ, we hope our results still
depict interesting feedback on our games [24]. [18] (Table 1), a sub-
jective emotion questionnaire (SEQ) using 5-Likert scale questions
(Table 2), and conducted semi-structured interviews to analyze
the players’ preferences and empathy in each case [7]. We only
tested the low difficulty mode of both VR games and asked each
participant to experience all four myopic conditions and collected
the game scores. After each experimental condition, participants
were asked to complete the above-mentioned questionnaires. Par-
ticipants finished the two games in about thirty minutes.

take on the role of a pedestrian standing still and greeting "acquain-
tances" who are among other pedestrians. We use four international
famous people as "acquaintances" for players to choose. Before start-
ing the game, we show their pictures to the participants to ensure
they know these faces. Groups of pedestrians will walk facing the
player at the same speed, and disappear after 15 seconds. In each

CHI PLAY ’21, October 18–21, 2021, Virtual Event, Austria

All participants had fun playing the two VR myopia games, but
all had their own preferences. For instance, P1 (who does not have
myopia) talked about his VR experience of being a myopic person.
P1 said, "I enjoyed playing both VR myopic games, [because] I’m not
myopic, so this is the first time I’ve felt the inconveniences experienced
by people with different levels of myopia in their lives. It’s almost
impossible for me to see anything else in high myopia condition...".
P3 (who has moderate myopia) talked about his previous miscon-
ceptions about high myopia, saying that "I thought before that high
myopia might be nothing [different] [because] I was moderately near-
sighted. But after experiencing these two games I found I was wrong.
These two games have enhanced my empathy [toward people with
high myopia]."

4 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We acknowledge that our design work has limitations [13] and
that there are several possibilities to extend it. Our two VR games
represent myopic people’s challenges through two real-life scenar-
ios. Other scenarios are certainly possible. To help develop these,
we think that body interaction theories in HCI research can com-
plement our future work. For example, Merleau-Ponty’s "motor
intentionality" [45], Mueller et al.’s concept of limited body inter-
action [11] and their theoretical basis about using the body as an
interface for games [30] could enrich our notion of body control
for more immersive myopic simulations [35]. Future work can in-
vestigate how to better utilize the body as a more direct mode of
interaction to enhance the myopic game experience and achieve
better empathy in players.

Our study and game design can be further refined and the myopia
rendering in VR could be enhanced. We only blurred the screen
without using any other extra graphics rendering deformations or
transformations for players to experience different cases of myopia.
Moreover, moderate to high myopia is usually accompanied by
other ocular diseases such as astigmatism [16], which is difficult to
simulate in VR. Given that our main study was focused on myopia
experiences per se, future work could explore the possibility of
simulating the concomitant or superimposed ocular diseases in VR.
Regarding measuring empathy, we used a self-reported question-
naire to collect empathy changes. In future work, we plan to add a
way of capturing facial expressions [9, 10] and EEG signals, such as
Neo-Noumena [38], to record participants’ affective and biological
changes.

Further exploration is required to form a framework for devel-
oping myopic VR games. From the perspective of accessible design,
only by fully experiencing different levels of myopia can designers
effectively design accessible products for people with myopia [40].
Aside from product design, the ability to empathize with people
with different degrees of myopia is conducive to making our society
more inclusive and understanding towards those with visual chal-
lenges. Therefore, in the future we plan to include a larger sample
size to further evaluate our VR games, extract design inspirations
and recommendations. Our long term plan is to formulate a frame-
work that can guide the design of VR games aimed at fostering
people’s empathetic attitudes toward people with different degrees
of myopia.

5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented two VR myopic games, Myopic Bike
and Say Hi, that allows players to experience the challenges people
with myopia encounter in their everyday life. that myopic peo-
ple encounter when not wearing glasses. We evaluated these two
games with four participants and collected their feedback using
questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Findings suggested
that the two VR myopic games could foster empathy toward people
with myopia.
