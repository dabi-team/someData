Abstract In this chapter, we investigate phase retrieval algorithm for the single particle X-ray imag-

Introduction

The Phase Retrieval Problem

The mathematical formulation of phase retrieval is solving a set of quadratic equations. Methods
to solve the phase retrieval problem can be classiﬁed into two categories: convex and non-convex ap-
proaches. Convex methods like PhaseLift (Cand`es et al. (2013)), convert the quadratic system equation
to a linear system equation through a matrix-lifting technique. The PhaseMax method (Goldstein and
Studer (2017); Bahmani and Romberg (2017)) operates in the original signal space rather than lifting
it to a higher dimensional space. It replaces the non-convex constraints with inequality constraints that
deﬁne convex sets. The convex approaches have good recovery guarantees, but their computational
complexities are usually high when the dimension of the signals is large.

On the other hand, the non-convex approaches turn the phase retrieval into an optimization
problem. The most popular class of methods is based on alternate projection, such as the hybrid
input output (HIO) method (Bauschke et al. (2003)), the Error Reduction (ER) method (Fienup and
Wackerman (1986)) and the relaxed averaged alternating reﬂections (RAAR) method (Luke (2004)).
These methods are iterative projection methods, since they involve iterative projections onto the
constraint sets. Unlike the convex approaches, convergence is not guaranteed for these algorithms, and
stagnation may occur due to non-uniqueness of the solution (Fienup and Wackerman (1986)). A uniﬁed
evaluation of these iterative projection algorithms can be found in the paper of Marchesini (2007).
Recently, a method called Wirtinger ﬂow (Cand`es et al. (2015)) is proposed. It works well with spectral
method for initialization. The follow-up works include the truncated Wirtinger ﬂow (Chen and Cand`es
(2017)), truncated amplitude ﬂow (Wang et al. (2017)) and reshaped Wirtinger ﬂow (Zhang and
Liang (2016)). These methods have less computational complexities and have theoretical convergence
guarantees.

The randomized Kaczmarz algorithm is introduced to solve the phase retrieval problem by Wei (Wei
(2015)).The randomized Kaczmarz method can be viewed as a special case of the stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) (Needell et al. (2014)). For the phase retrieval problem, the method is essentially
SGD for the amplitude ﬂow objective. It was shown numerically that the method outperforms the
Wirtinger ﬂow and the ER method (Wei (2015)). The convergence rate of the randomized Kaczmarz
method for the linear system is studied in the paper of Strohmer and Vershynin (2009). The theoretical
justiﬁcation of using randomized Kaczmarz method for phase retrieval has been presented in the paper
of Tan and Vershynin (2019).

Challenges of X-ray Data Processing

The structure of biological macromolecules is the key to understand the living cells function and
behavior. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Bernstein et al. (1977)) currently has more than 173,110
structures, but many structures of biological molecules and their complexes have not been determined.
The cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and the X-ray crystallography have been successfully applied
in this ﬁeld. The X-ray crystallography has solved about 90% of these structures. However, growing
high quality crystals of biomolecules is challenging, especially for biologically functional molecules.
Therefore, determining structures from single molecules are appealing.

The use of the X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL) is a recent development in structure biology. The
idea behind this method is to record the instantaneous elastic scattering from an ultrashort pulse. The
pulse is so brief that it terminates before the onset of radiation damage (“diﬀract before destroy”) (Liu

Randomized Kaczmarz Method for Single Particle X-ray Image Phase Retrieval

3

and Spence (2016)). With this application, the single particle imaging becomes possible, even at room
temperature. It allows one to understand the structures and dynamics of macromolecules.

The diﬀerence between the Cryo-EM and the X-ray crystallography is that the Cryo-EM data
includes phase information of the structural factors, while the X-ray crystallographic diﬀraction data
only provide amplitude information, but lack phase information (Wang and Wang (2017); Scheres
(2012)). The illustrations and data processing examples are shown in the paper of Sorzano et al.
(2004); Xian et al. (2018), and Gu et al. (2020). In order to solve the biological structures, the phase
information is essential. It is normally obtained by experimental or computational means.

The challenges of XFEL single particle imaging also include the following: (i) the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) is low, and the information is inﬂuenced by noise; (ii) the orientation of each sample
particle is unknown, leading to the diﬃculty in data merging and 3D reconstruction; (iii) conforma-
tional heterogeneity places a hurdle for single particle identiﬁcation and reconstruction (Wang and
Wang (2017)). In this chapter, we investigate the phase retrieval algorithms of the XFEL data. The
baseline for a good phase retrieval algorithm is its robustness against noises and the incompleteness
of information (Shi et al. (2019)).

Phase retrieval with noisy or incomplete measurements

The number of photons detected by the optical sensor is of Poisson distribution. For the phase retrieval
problem contaminated by the Poisson noise, or has incomplete magnitude information, the prior
information is crucial to process the data. Research for imposing prior information to image processing
is shown in the literature (Le et al. (2007); Zhang et al. (2012); Hunt et al. (2018)).

In order to better reconstruct the data, one can consider a variational model by introducing
a total variation (TV) regularization, which is widely used in imaging processing community. TV
regularization can enable recovery of signals from incomplete or limited measurements. The alternating
direction of multipliers method (ADMM) (Glowinski and Le Tallec (1989); Wu and Tai (2010)), and the
split Bregman method (Goldstein and Osher (2009)) are usually applied to solve the TV-regularization
problem. They have been applied in the phase retrieval problem (Chang et al. (2016, 2018); Bostan
et al. (2014); Li et al. (2016)).

Besides TV regularization, Tikhonov regularization is another important smoothing techniques in
variational image denoising. It is often applied in noise removal. The phase retrieval problem with a
Tikhonov regularization has been solved by the Gauss-Newton method (Seifert et al. (2006); Sixou
et al. (2013); Langemann and Tasche (2008); Ramos et al. (2019)). Considering the sparsity constraints,
the ﬁxed point iterative approach (Fornasier and Rauhut (2008); Tropp (2006); Ma et al. (2018)) has
been applied for the problem with nonlinear joint sparsity regulation.

Outline

In this chapter, we further advance the convergence speed of the randomized Kaczmarz method for
phase retrieval. The idea comes from the fact that the randomized Kaczmarz method is a weighted
SGD, and the convergence rate of SGD is slower because of the random sampling variance. Therefore,
reducing the sampling variance can improve the convergence rate of the randomized Kaczmarz method.
Inspired by the stochastic variance reduce gradient (SVRG) method (Johnson and Zhang (2013)), we
present the variance-reduced randomized Kaczmarz method (VR-RK) for single particle X-ray imaging
phase retrieval. Considering the sparsity constraint and generality of the problem, we present the VR-
RK method under both the L1 and the L2 constraints for computational analysis. Numerical results
on the virus data show that the VR-RK method can recover information with higher accuracy at a
faster convergence rate. It helps recover the lost information due to the beam stop for blocking the
incidence X-ray beam.

The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. In section “Background: Phase Retrieval and
Stochastic Optimization”, we give a general overview of phase retrieval and stochastic optimization. In
section “Variance-Reduced Randomized Kaczmarz (VR-RK) method”, the proposed variance reduced
randomized Kaczmarz method, and its variation under L1 and L2 constraints are presented. The
evaluation of the algorithm is shown in the “Application: Robust Phase Retrieval of the Single Particle
X-ray Images” section, and the single particle X-ray image data are tested. The “Conclusion” section
concludes the chapter.

Background: Phase Retrieval and Stochastic Optimization

Phase Retrieval

Formulation of the phase retrieval problem is as follows:

min
x

m
(cid:88)

(yk − |(cid:104)ak, x(cid:105)|2)2.

k=1

(1)

where y is the measurement, x is the signal that need to be recovered, and ak is the measurement
operating vector. In the setting of forward X-ray scattering imaging at the far ﬁeld, ak is a Fourier
vector, and y is a diﬀraction pattern of the target. The problem in phase retrieval is the limitation of
optical sensors, which measures only the intensity.

The loss function of eq. (1) is expressed as the squared diﬀerence between measurement intensities
and the modelled intensities. It is a system of quadratic equation, and therefore it is a non-convex
problem.

To solve eq. (1), the alternate projection methods are often used, such as HIO, ER, and RAAR
methods as mentioned previously. These algorithms can be expressed in the form of ﬁxed-point equa-
tion. They can be implemented jointly to better avoid local minima.

When the loss function is expressed as the squared loss of amplitudes, the formulation can be

written as:

min
x

m
(cid:88)

√
(
k=1

yk − |(cid:104)ak, x(cid:105)|)2.

(2)

To solve eq (2), it is possible to apply the amplitude ﬂow algorithm (Wang et al. (2017)), which is
essentially a gradient descent algorithm that can converge under good initialization.

Stochastic Optimization and the Kaczmarz Method

The phase retrieval problem can be solved by stochastic optimization approaches. For the problem:

min
x

1
m

m
(cid:88)

k=1

fk(x),

(3)

the gradient descent method updating rule is: xk+1 = xk − tk
m

∇fk(xk), where tk is the step size at

each iteration, and m is the number of samples, or the number of measurements in the phase retrieval
setting. The gradient descent is expensive and it requires evaluation of n derivatives at each iteration.
To reduce the computational cost, the SGD is proposed:

m
(cid:80)
k=1

xk+1 = xk − tk∇fik (xk)

(4)

Randomized Kaczmarz Method for Single Particle X-ray Image Phase Retrieval

5

where ik is an index chosen uniformly in random from {1, · · · , m} at each iteration. The computational
cost is 1/m of the standard gradient descent. The SVRG is proposed to reduce variance of SGD, and
has a faster convergence rate (Johnson and Zhang (2013)). It is operated in epochs. In each epoch,
the updating process is:

xk+1 = xk − η

(cid:16)

∇fik (xk) − ∇fik (¯x) +

1
m

m
(cid:88)

i=1

(cid:17)

∇fi(¯x)

(5)

where η is the step size, and ¯x is a snapshot value in each epoch (Johnson and Zhang (2013)).

The Kaczmarz method is a well-known iterative method for solving a system of linear equations
Ax = b, where A ∈ Rm×n, x ∈ Rn, and b ∈ Rm. The classical Kaczmarz method sweeps through the
rows in A in a cyclic manner, and projects the current estimate onto a hyperplane associated with
the row of A to get the new estimate. The randomized Kaczmarz method randomly chooses the row
for projection in each iteration:

xk+1 = xk +

bik − (cid:104)aik, xk(cid:105)
||aik ||2
2

aik

(6)

where aik is the row of A. The randomized Kaczmarz can be viewed as a reweighted SGD with
importance sampling for the least squares problem (Needell et al. (2014)):

F (x) =

1
2

||Ax − b||2

2 =

m
(cid:88)

(aT

i x − bi)2.

i=1

(7)

The randomized Kaczmarz algorithm is essentially stochastic gradient descent for the amplitude
ﬂow problem in eq. (2). This suggests that the acceleration schemes for SGD, such as the variance
reduced approach, can be applied to the algorithm, and improve phase retrieval.

The update scheme for randomized Kaczmarz for the phase retrieval objective of eq. (8), according

to the paper of Tan and Vershynin (2019), is:

xk+1 = xk + ηkaik

where,

ηk =

Let µi(x) = ∇hi(x), and s be the size of the epoch. The Variance-Reduced Randomized Kaczmarz
algorithm for phase retrieval is shown in Algorithm 1.

To deal with this formula, the majorization-minimization (MM) technique and the C-PRIME

Application: Robust Phase Retrieval of the Single Particle X-ray Images

In this section, we present numerical results of phase retrieval of the single particle X-ray imaging
data.

Synthetic single particle data recovery experiment

The ﬁrst experiment is to test the reconstruction eﬃciency of the virus data, as shown in Figure 1.
The image size of Figure 1(a) is 755 × 755 pixels, and the pixel values are normalized to [0,1]. The
diﬀraction pattern (Figure 1(b)) is created by taking the Fourier transform of Figure 1(a). In this
experiment, X-ray scattering signals are mainly observed at low resolutions, corresponding to low
frequencies in Fourier space. A gap is placed in the center of the diﬀraction pattern to allow the
incident beam to pass through, to avoid damaging or saturating detector sensors. The gap results in
an information loss at low frequency regime, as shown in Figure 1(c). The low frequency information
corresponds to the overall shape of the object. Without which, it poses a challenge for reconstruction.

in the gap is 409.

We reconstruct the sample virus image from the diﬀraction pattern with detector gap in Figure
1(c). The VR-RK, Randomized Kaczmarz, HIO, and RAAR methods are tested in the MATLAB

platform. In order to reconstruct the data, a reference signal is used as a priori for preprocessing as
described in the paper of Barmherzig et al. (2019), and the numerical iteration is then performed.
Comparison of convergence rate and the relative square errors are shown in Figure 2 and Table 1.
The relative square error is deﬁned by: ||x − ˆx||2/||x||2, where x is the ground truth image, and ˆx is
the reconstructed image. The experiment shows that the VR-RK algorithm has a faster convergence
rate and a better reconstruction accuracy compared with the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm and
the iterative projection algorithms.

Recovery eﬃciency under constraints

To further illustrate the convergence rate, we compare the VR-RK algorithm and the randomized
Kaczmarz algorithm under L1 and L2 constraints on reconstructing the virus sample data. The cost
function changes per iteration is shown in Figure 3. From the ﬁgure, the loss function decays faster
in VR-RK than randomized Kaczmarz method.

Considering that the single particle X-ray imaging data are inﬂuenced by the Poisson noise, and
we examine the reconstruction accuracy at various noise levels, with (cid:15) from 0.005 to 0.1, and the
measurement under the noise: y = |Ax|2(1 + (cid:15)).

Table 2 shows the relative square error of reconstruction using diﬀerent phase retrieval algorithms
in various noise level. From Table 2, we can see that the VR-RK method outperforms other algorithms
under noise.

Results of the PR772 dataset

We test the VR-RK algorithm on the PR772 particle dataset (Reddy et al. (2017)). The image size is
256 × 256 pixels, and the pixel values are scaled to the range of [0, 255]. Illustration of the diﬀraction
pattern of the single particle data is shown in Figure 4(a) and Figure 4(e).

For this dataset, the shrinkwrap method is applied to obtain a tight object support (Shi et al.
(2019); Marchesini et al. (2003)), and the square root of the diﬀraction intensities is used as a reference
for the missing pixels during numerical iteration. An recovery example is shown in Figure 4, and more
recovery examples are presented in the supplementary materials.

We use the VR-RK algorithm, RAAR and HIO methods to recovery the data, and classify the
single-particle scattering pattern data and the non-single-particle scattering pattern data. We use
the VR-RK for computation. There are 497 samples with labels in the validation set (Shi et al.
(2019)). Among them, 208 are single-particle samples, and 289 are non-single-particle samples. We
use ISOMAP for data compression and clustering, and KNN for classiﬁcation. We use 4-fold cross
validation. The VR-RK has the best result. The AUCs of the binary classiﬁcation results are listed as
follows.

From the results, we can see that the VR-RK method can help recover the data, and improve

classiﬁcation rate.

Conclusion

single particle phase retrieval. The VR-RK method is inspired by the randomized Kaczmarz method
