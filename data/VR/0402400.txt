Abstract

The simultaneous partition problems are classical problems of the combinatorial ge-
ometry which have the natural ﬂavor of the equivariant topology. The k-fan partition
problems have attracted a lot of attention [1], [2], [3] and forced some hard concrete
combinatorial calculations in the equivariant cohomology [4]. These problems can be
reduced, by a beautiful scheme of [2], to a ”typical” question of the existence of a D2n
equivariant map f : V2(R3) → Wn − ∪A(α), where V2(R3) is the space of all orthonor-
mal 2-frames in R3 and Wn −∪A(α) is the complement of the appropriate arrangement.
We introduce the target extension scheme which allow us to use the equivariant ob-
struction theory as a tool for proving that: for every two proper measures on the sphere
S2, and any α = (a, a + b, b) ∈ R3
>0, there exists an α-partition of theses measures by
a 3-fan.
The signiﬁcance of these results, among other, is that, beside negative results [4],
the equivariant obstruction theory can pull oﬀ some positive results, which were not
attained by other means.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem

A k-fan (x; l1, l2, . . . , lk) on the sphere S2 is formed of a point x, called the center of the fan,
and k great semicircles l1, . . . , lk emanating from x. We always assume counter clockwise
enumeration on great semicircles l1, . . . , lk of a k-fan. Sometimes instead of lines we use
open angular sectors σi between li and li+1, i = 1, . . . , k. In that case we denote a k-fan
with (x; σ1, σ2, . . . , σk).
Let µ1, µ2, . . . , µm be proper Borel probability measures on S2. Measure µ is proper if
µ([a, b]) = 0 for any circular arc [a, b] ⊂ S2 and µ(U ) > 0 for each nonempty open set
U ⊂ S2. All results can be extended to more general measures, including the counting
measures of ﬁnite sets, see [2] for related examples.

Problem 1 Find all triples (m, k, α) ∈ N×N × Rk such that for any collection of m mea-
sures {µ1, µ2, . . . , µm}, there exists a k-fan (x; l1, . . . , lk) with the property

(∀i = 1, . . . , k) (∀j = 1, . . . , m) µj(σi) = αi

That kind of a k-fan (x; l1, . . . , lk) is called an α-partition for the collection of measures
{µj}m

j=1.

The analysis given in [2] shows that the most interesting triples are (3, 2, α), (2, 3, α), (2, 4, α).

1.2 The statement of results

We are interested in the problem of 3-fan partitions of two measures on S2, respectively.
We prove the following result:

Theorem 2 Lets choose α = (a, a + b, b) ∈ R3
measures µ and ν on the sphere S2 admit an α-partition by a 3-fan p = (x; l1, l2, l3), i. e.

>0 such that 2a + 2b = 1. Then any two proper

A2,3 ⊇ {(a, a + b, b) ∈ R3 | a, b > 0, 2a + b = 1}.

Remark 3 The case a = b = 1 was already considered in [2]

1.3 The solution scheme

The solution of the problem has two natural parts. The ﬁrst part is the reduction of the
problem to the question of the existence of the appropriate equivariant map. The second
part is and topological eﬀort to disprove the existence of a such map. There is also a third
part of the proof, the limit argument.
It extends the result from rational triples to real
triples, but we omited it because it is the standard part of every similiar proof.

Reduction to the equivariant problem:

• The conﬁguration space / test map procedure of Imre B´ar´any and Jiˇri Matouˇsek from
n ), such that there is

[2] reduces the problem to the question: Is there an α = ( a1
no D2n-map V2(R3) → Wn \ ∪A(α)?

• The extension of scalars equivalence from homological algebra, [5], allows us to change
n ), such that there is no

the initial equivariant question to: Is there an α = ( a1
Q4n-map S3 → Wn \ ∪A(α)?

n , a3

n , a2

• The elementary obstruction theory can convince us that the actual free Q4n action on
S3 is not of the essential importance. Thus we can always change it the way it pleases
us.

Obstruction theory approach:

• The dimensional reasons of the problem, π1(Wn \ ∪A(α)) 6= ∅, implies that there are
two essential obstructions. This forces us to introduce the target extension scheme,
and instead of dealing with two obstructions we have only one to compute. The target
extension scheme extends the Q4n space Wn \ ∪A(α) in such a way that connectivity
increases by one. Thus, the problem of the existence of the Q4n-map from S3 to this
extension has only one obstruction.

• Once we extend the complement Wn \ ∪A(α) we use the classical obstruction theory
and the ”map in general position” method to prove that appropriate obstruction is
not zero. This part of the proof goes in a small number of steps, like we described in
the section 3.7.

• The main step is the identiﬁcation of the obstruction cocycle. This is the point where
many previous papers have been broken ([12], proof of theorem 4.2, equality (25) and
[18], proof of theorem 6.1). We use the clear geometrical picture and simple testing
methods (in sections 4.8 and 4.9) to interpret the obstruction element as a non-zero
element of the appropriate coinvariant group.

This scheme of the solution, with diﬀerent extensions, can be applied to other cases of the
3-fan / 2-measures problem, as well on the 2-fan / 3-measures problem. The main idea of
extending the target space, of course with some variations, can be applied on every problem
of the existace of the equivaiant map to a complement of an arrangement, or to any space
that has natural extension candidates.

2 From a partition problem to an equivariant problem

2.1 Reduction to the equivariant problem

The reduction of the fan partition problem to the equivariant problem is done by the con-
ﬁgurations space / test map scheme. The main idea is to look at the space of all possible
solutions and to rephrase the question in terms of coincidences of the associated test map.
Imre B´ar´any and Jiˇri Matouˇsek demonstrated in [2] that the test map scheme can be applied
on the problem of α-partitioning of m-measures on S2 by spherical k-fans. In a very elegant
way this problem was reduced to the problem of the existence of the appropriate equivariant
map. We brieﬂy review this reduction for the (3, 2) case of this problem.

The conﬁguration space. Let µ and ν be two proper Borel probability measures on S2,
and Fk the space of all k-fans on the sphere S2. The space Xµ of all possible solutions
associated to the measure µ is deﬁned by

Xµ = {(x; l1, . . . , ln) ∈ Fn | (∀i = 1, . . . , n) µ(σi) = 1

n }.

Observe that every n-fan (x; l1, . . . , ln) ∈ Xµ is completely determined by the pair (x, l1)
or equivalently, the pair (x, y), where y is the unit tangent vector to l1 at x. Thus, the
space Xµ is a Stiefel manifold V2(R3) of all orthonormal 2-frames in R3. Keep in mind that
V2(R3) ∼= SO(3) ∼= RP 3.
Test map. Let Rn be an Euclidean space with the standard orthonormal basis e1, e2, . . . , en
and the associated coordinate functions x1, x2, . . . , xn. Let Wn be the hyperplane {x ∈ Rn |
x1 + x2 + . . . + xn = 0} in Rn, and suppose that α-vectors have the following form

α = ( a1

n , a2

n , a3

n ) ∈

1
n

N3 ⊆ Q3,

where a1 + a2 + a3 = n. Then test maps for the (3, 2) fan problem are deﬁned by

Fν : Xµ → Wn

Fν (p) = (ν(σ1) − 1
The action. The dihedral group D2n = hj, ε | εn = j2 = 1, εj = jεn−1 i acts both on the
possible solution space Xµ and the linear subspace Wn ⊆ Rn by

n , . . . , ν(σn) − 1
n )

Xµ :

(cid:26)

ε(x; l1, . . . , ln) = (x; ln, l1, . . . , ln−1)
j(x; l1, . . . , ln) = (−x; l1, ln, ln−1, . . . , l2)

, Wn :

ε(x1, . . . , xn) = (x2, . . . , xn, x1)
j(x1, . . . , xn) = (xn, . . . , x2, x1)

,

(cid:26)

for (x; l1, . . . , ln) ∈ Xµ and (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Wn. The action of D2n on Xµ is free.
Observe that the space of possible solutions Xµ is D2n-homeomorphic to the manifold V2(R3),
where V2(R3) is a D2n-space given by

ε(x, y) = (x, Rx(

2π
n

)(y)), j(x, y) = (−x, y),

and Rx(θ) : R3 → R3 is the rotation round the axes determined by x through the angle θ.
The test space. The test space in this problem is the union ∪A(α) ⊂ Wn of a smallest
D2n-invariant linear subspace arrangement A(α), which contains linear subspace L(α) ⊂ Wn.
The subspace L(α) is deﬁned by

L(α) = {x ∈ Rn | ξ1(x) = ξ2(x) = ξ3(x) = 0} ⊆ Wn,

where

ξ1(x) = x1 + . . . + xa1 ,

ξ2(x) = xa1+1 + . . . + xa1+a2 ,

ξ3(x) = xa1+a2+1 + . . . + xn.

Since the test map Fν is obviously D2n-equivariant, the following standard proposition is
proved.
Proposition 4 Let α = ( a1
n , a2
there is no D2n-equivariant map

n N3 ⊆ Q3 be a vector such that a1 + a2 + a3 = n. If

n , a3

then for any two measures µ and ν on S2, there exists an α-partition (x; l1, l2, l3) of measures
µ and ν.

2.2 Modifying Problem

Knowing the fact that for an odd n, there always exists a Zn-map f : S3 → V2(R3), B´ar´any
and Matouˇsek in [2] questioned if there is a Zn-map from the sphere S3 to the complements
of appropriate arrangements. To do something similar we extend the group, like in [18]
and [4]. We use well known “extension of scalars” equivalence from homological algebra, [5]
Section III.3.
The generalized quaternion group. Let S3 = S(H) = Sp(1) be the group of all unit
quaternions and let ǫ = ǫ2n = cos π
n ∈ S(H) be a root of unity. Group hǫi is a
subgroup of S(H) of the order 2n. Then, the generalized quaternion group, [6] p. 253, is
the subgroup

n + i sin π

Q4n = {1, ǫ, . . . , ǫ2n−1, j, ǫj, . . . , ǫ2n−1j}
of S3, of the order 4n. Let H = {1, ǫn} = {1, −1} ⊂ Q4n. Then, it is not hard to see that
the quotient group Q4n/H is isomorphic to the dihedral group D2n of the order 2n.

Proposition 5 Let the generalized quaternion group Q4n act on S3 as a subgroup, and on
Wn via already deﬁned D2n action by the quotient homomorphism Q4n → Q4n/{1, −1} ∼=
D2n. Then the following maps coexist:

D2n-map V2(R3) → Wn \ ∪A(α) and Q4n-map S3 → Wn \ ∪A(α).

By the coexistence we mean that the one map exists if and only if the other map exists, i.e.
the one can’t exist without the other.

Proof. Let us denote the target space Wn \ ∪A(α) with T . Also, observe that S3/{1, −1} ∼=
RP 3 ∼= SO(3) ∼= V2(R3)
⇒: Let F : V2(R3) → T be a D2n-map. The quotient map p : S3 → S3/{1, −1} ∼=
V2(R3) is a Q4n-map where the Q4n-acts on V2(R3) by the quotient homomorphism Q4n →
Q4n/{1, −1} ∼= D2n. Since, Q4n acts on both V2(R3) and T via the quotient homomorphism,
the given D2n-map F : V2(R3) → T can also be seen as the Q4n-map. Thus, the composition

F ◦ p : S3 −→ S3/{1, −1} ∼= V2(R3) −→ T

is the required Q4n-map S3 → T .
⇒: Let G : S3 → T be a Q4n-map. Observe that S3/{1, −1} ∼= V2(R3) can be seen as a
D2n ∼= Q4n/{1, −1} space by {1, −1}x
7−→ {1, −1}(gx), where x ∈ S3 and g ∈ Q4n. Since
the subgroup {1, −1} acts trivially on T , there is a factorization of the map G through the
quotient h : S3/{1, −1} → T such that G = h ◦ p. The map h is the required D2n-map

g{1,−1}

h(g{1, −1} · {1, −1}x) = G(g · x) = g · G(x) = g · h({1, −1}x) = (g{1, −1}) · h({1, −1}x).

Remark 6 The Q4n action on S3 is free. Also, the Q4n action on Wn is the restriction of
the following Q4n action on Rn. Let e1, .., en be the standard orthonormal basis in Rn. The
action is deﬁned by

ǫ · ei = ei mod n+1 and j · ei = en−i+1.

5

The free action on S3. Since the sphere S3 is 2-connected it turns out that the partic-
ular Q4n-action on S3 is not something we have to live with. The elementary equivariant
obstruction theory allows us to prove the following useful fact.

Proposition 7 If γ1 and γ2 are G-actions on S3 and γ1 is free, then there exists a G-map
f : S3 → S3 such that

(∀g ∈ G) (∀x ∈ S3) f (g ·1 x) = g ·2 f (x).

Proof. The statement is true because S3 is 2-connected, γ1 is free and so there are no
obstructions to extend a G-map from 0-skeleton to S3.
Thus, when the time comes we will be able to use any free Q4n action on S3 and we will
have the favorite one.

3 Obstruction theory approach

Once again, denote the target space Wn \ ∪A(α) with T . To answer a question of the
existence of Q4n-map S3 → T we will try to employ the classical obstruction theory. Since
the maximal elements of the arrangement A(α) are of the codimension 2 = (n − 1) − (n − 3)
in Wn, the complement is connected and the ﬁrst obstruction lives in H 2
Q4n (S3, π1(T )). In
this case it is very hard even to identify this group, not to mention to identify the particular
element in it. Even if we do manage to identify and calculate the ﬁrst obstruction, there is
a good chance that it is zero, so the second obstructions should be calculated. To omit this
diﬃculties we use the nature of the target spaces, introduce the target extension scheme and
then use the equivariant obstruction theory.

3.1 The Target extension scheme

According to the proposition 4 we would prefer to prove that there are no equivariant Q4n-
maps S3 → T . Thus the following scheme can be of some help.
The basic idea of the target extension scheme is to ﬁnd a Q4n space E which contains the
target space T and to prove that there is no Q4n-map S3 → E. Thus, this would imply that
there is no Q4n-map S3 → T .
Since the target space T is the complement of the arrangement, the basic idea can be reﬁned
as follows:

(A) Increase the codimension of the arrangement: Take an arbitrary hyper arrangement
J in Wn. By the hyper arrangement we mean the arrangement of hyperplanes and / or
closed hyperplane halfspaces. Then form the minimal Q4n-invariant arrangement A(J , α)
containing the family J ∩ L(α) = {J ∩ L(α) | J ∈ J }. Then inclusion ∪A(J , α) ⊆ ∪A(α)
implies that Wn − ∪A(J , α) ⊇ Wn − ∪A(α). Observe that the dimension of maximal
elements of the arrangement A(J , α) is n − 4. Let us denote (when it suits us) the new
union ∪A(J , α) by U ∗, and the new complement Wn − ∪A(J , α) by T ∗.

(B) Apply the obstruction theory to the new question: Is there a Q4n-map S3 → T ∗.
Since the codimension of maximal elements of the new deﬁned arrangement in Wn is 3,
the target space T ∗ is 1-connected and consequently 2-simple in the sense that π1(T ∗) acts

6

trivially on π2(T ∗). Thus by Hurewicz theorem π2(T ∗) ∼= [S2, T ∗] ∼= H2(T ∗; Z). Then the
part of the obstruction exact sequence ([8], [17]) we are interested in is

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)).

The exactness means that the set [S3, T ∗]Q4n 6= ∅ if and only if τQ4n (∗) ∈ H 3
Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z))
is equal to zero. The element τQ4n (∗) depends only on T ∗. Thus, the main question trans-
forms in

3.2 A map in the general position

We evaluate the class τQ4n (∗) by the so called ”map in the general position” standard
procedure, [17]. Since the set [S3
(2), T ∗]Q4n is a point, it suﬃces to calculate an obstruction
cocycle for the particular map h.
Let h : S3 → Wn be an arbitrary Q4n-simplicial map which is in the general position. What
we mean by the general position is that for any simplex σ in S3

h(σ) ∩ U ∗ 6= ∅ ⇒ dim(h(σ)) = 3 and h(σ) ∩ U ∗ = {p1, .., pk} ⊂ inth(σ).

Now let h : S3 → Wn be a Q4n-map in the general position. Then the associated cohomology
class of the obstruction cocycle cQ4n (h) ∈ C3
Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) = HomQ4n (C3(S3), H2(T ∗; Z))
In order to calculate it let us de-
[cQ4n (h)] = τ (∗).
for the map h is equal to τ (∗), i.e.
scribe the cocycle cQ4n (h) a little bit closer. Let σ be an oriented 3-simplex in S3. Then
cQ4n (h)(σ) ∈ H2(T ∗; Z) is the h∗ image of the fundamental class of ∂(σ) ∼= S2 by the map
h∗ : H2(∂(σ); Z) → H2(T ∗; Z), i.e.

cQ4n (h)(σ) = h∗[∂(σ)].

3.3 The nature of the obstruction cocycle

The following proposition will narrow our attention to the torsion part of the group
H 3
found in [4].

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) and will be the perfect control factor in our calculations. It can be also

Proposition 8 The cohomology class of the obstruction cocycle cQ4n (h) is a torsion element
of the group H 3

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)).

Proof. Let H be a subgroup of Q4n. The restriction map

r : H 3

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) → H 3

H (S3, H2(T ∗; Z))

7

on the cochain level sends c ∈ C3
Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) a Q4n-cochain to now H-cochain c ∈
H (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)). The deﬁnition of the obstruction cocycle implies that r(cQ4n (h)) is the
C3
obstruction cocycle for the extension of the H-map in the general position h. It is a known
fact ([5] Section III.9. Proposition 9.5.(ii)) that the composition of the restriction with the
transfer τ : H 3
Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) is just a multiplication by the index
[Q4n : H],

H (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) → H 3

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) → H 3

H (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) → H 3

[cQ4n (h)]

7−→

[cH (h)]

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z))
7−→ [Q4n : H] · [cQ4n (h)].

Particularly, let H be the trivial subgroup of Q4n. The sphere S3 is 2-connected and H is a
trivial group, so the map h can be extended to a H-map S3 → M . Thus, [cH (h)] = 0 and
consequently [Q4n : H] · [cQ4n (h)] = 0 in H 3

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)).

3.4 The Q4n cellular structures on S3

In order to start eﬃcient computations of the obstruction cocycle we need to describe the
concrete Q4n CW -structures of the sphere S3. The proposition 7 allows us to be very picky
in selecting the adequate cellular structures. We describe two Q4n cellular structures the
natural one and the most economical one, and the cellular map joining them. The direct
consequence of these discussions is the isomorphism

H 3

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) ∼= H2(T ∗; Z)Q4n .

The natural Q4n cellular-simplicial structure. This structure comes from the join
decomposition S3 = S1 ∗ S1 of the 3-sphere. Let the sphere S1 be represented by the
simplicial complex of the regular 2n-gon P2n. Then the sphere S3, as the simplicial complex,
is the join P (1)
2n be denoted by
a1, .., a2n and b1, .., b2n, respectively. The action of the group Q4n on S3 is deﬁned on vertices
by

2n of two copies of P2n. Let the vertex of P (1)

2n and P (2)

2n ∗ P (2)

ǫ · ai = ai mod 2n+1, ǫ · bi = bi mod 2n+1, j · a1 = b1

and it extends equivariantly to upper skeletons. Then, for example

j · ai = jǫi−1 · a1 = ǫ(2n−1)(i−1)j · a1 = ǫ(2n−1)(i−1) · b1 = b(2n−i+1) mod 2n+1
j · [a1, a2; b1, b2] = [b1, b2n; an+1, an].

The associated chain complex C = {Ci} has the form

0 −→ Z4n2

−→ Z8n2

−→ Z4n2+4n −→ Z4n −→ 0.

This Q4n cellular structure makes the beautiful rectangular middle section of the join repre-
sentation S3 = S1 ∗ S1 = [0, 1]∗ [0, 1]/ ≈, (with some identiﬁcations). The action is indicated
in the ﬁgure 1.
The economic Q4n cellular structure. The second one comes from the minimal resolu-
tion of Z by free Q4n-modules described in [6], p. 253. The associated cellular complex has

one Q4n 0-cell a, two Q4n 1-cells b and b′, two Q4n 2-cells c and c′, and ﬁnally then one Q4n
3-cell e. The associated chain complex D = {Di} has the form

0 → Z[Q4n]e

where

∂

→ Z[Q4n]c ⊕ Z[Q4n]c′ ∂

→ Z[Q4n]b ⊕ Z[Q4n]b′ ∂

→ Z[Q4n]e → 0

∂e = (ǫ − 1)c − (ǫj − 1)c′ ∂c = (1 + .. + ǫn−1)b − (j + 1)b′ ∂c′ = (ǫj + 1)b + (ǫ − 1)b′

∂b = (ǫ − 1)a

∂b′ = (j − 1)a

.

Thus, it will be enough to look at the obstruction cocycle cQ4n (h) on the maximal cell e,
and to prove that its image is or is not zero, when we pass to cohomology.
Computing equivariant cohomology. The explicit formulas for the chain complex {Di}
is lurking us to apply the HomQ4n (·, H2(T ∗; Z)) functor. The result is the equivariant cochain
complex

0 ←− H2(T ∗; Z) Γ←− H2(T ∗; Z) ⊕ H2(T ∗; Z) ← H2(T ∗; Z) ⊕ H2(T ∗; Z) ←− H2(T ∗; Z) ←− 0

where Γ(p, q) = (ǫ − 1)p − (ǫj − 1)q for p, q ∈ H2(T ∗; Z). The deﬁnition of the equivariant
cohomology and a standard calculation imply that

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)) = H2(T ∗; Z)/ImΓ ∼= H2(T ∗; Z)Q4n

where H2(T ∗; Z)Q4n denote the group of coinvariants of the Q4n-module H2(T ∗; Z), [5].
The chain map. There exist a cellular map f : D → C, which can be visualized on
the ﬁgure 1 by identifying top dimensional cell e of the economic cell structure with the
transparent-shaded fundamental domain.

Since we are interested in 3-cochains, i.e. elements of C3
know the concrete expression for the cellular map on the top dimensional cell e,

Q4n (S3, H2(T ∗; Z)), we only need to

f(e) = [a1, ǫa1] ∗ [b1, ǫb1] + [ǫa1, ǫ2a1] ∗ [b1, ǫb1] + ... + [ǫn−1a1, ǫna1] ∗ [b1, ǫb1],

where the simplexes on the right hand side are appropriately oriented.

3.5 Point classes

It is of utmost importance for computation of the obstruction cocycle c(h)Q4n to pinpoint
some elements from the coeﬃcient module H2(T ∗; Z). The similar discussion can be found
in [4].
Let {W1, W2, . . . , Wk} be the family on maximal elements of the arrangement A of linear
(closed half-)subspaces in an (n + m)-dimensional, Euclidean space E. Let also maximal
elements have the constant dimension dim Wi = n. Let ˆD(A) = ∪A ∪ {+∞} ⊂ E ∪ {+∞} ∼=
Sn+m be the compactiﬁed union and M (A) = E \ ∪A the complement of the arrangement.
Let the point x ∈ int(Wi \ ∪j6=iWj ) and let Dε(x) = x + Dε be a disc around x, where Dε
is the ε-disc in the orthogonal complement W ⊥
i . For a suﬃciently small ε the intersection
Dǫ(x) ∩ (∪j6=iWj ) vanishes and we assume ﬁx such an ε. We assume that Dǫ(x) is oriented
by the orientation inherited from the ambient orientation and the orientation prescribed of
Wi.
The point class [x] ∈ Hm(E, M (A); Z) of x is inclusion image of the fundamental class
of the pair (Dǫ(x), ∂Dǫ(x)). By the Excision axiom described ε has no eﬀect on the class
[x].
In addition, by the Homotopy axiom, [x] is uniquely determined by the connected
component of Wi \ ∪j6=iWj. The image kxk := ∂[x] of the point class [x] by the isomorphism
Hm(E, M (A); Z) → Hm−1(M (A); Z) is also called the point class of x and has all the
properties of the original one.

Figure 2: The point classes and the broken point classes

Proposition 9 Let A be the arrangement of linear subspaces as above. Let x ∈ int(Wi \
∪j6=iWj) = Wi \ ∪j6=iWj .

(A) The class [x] ∈ Hm(E, M (A); Z) does not vanish.
(B) If we assume that (∀j) i 6= j ⇒ codimWi (Wi ∩ Wj) > 1, then the class [x] does not

depend on particular x.

(C) If there is a subspace Wj such that codimWi (Wi ∩ Wj) = 1 and x1, x2 belong to

diﬀerent connected components of Wi \ ∪j6=iWj, then [x1] 6= [x2].

10

Proof. (A) By the Ziegler-ˇZivaljevi´c formula [19], has he wedge decomposition

ˆD(A) ≃ ˆW1 ∨ ˆW2 ∨ . . . ∨ ˆWk ∨ ...

where the displayed factors correspond to maximal elements. Let ∆( ˆWi) ∈ H m(E, M (A); Z)
be the Poincar´e-Alexander dual of the fundamental homology class [ ˆWi] ∈ Hn( ˆD(A); Z)
associated with the sphere ˆWi in ˆE. Then ∆( ˆWi)([N ]) ∈ Z is the intersection number
[ ˆWi] ∩ [N ], whenever this number is correctly deﬁned, for example if N is a manifold and
the intersection ˆWi ∩ N is transversal. From here we see that ∆( ˆWi)([x]) = 1 and so [x]
does not vanish.

(B) Since the assumption implies the connectness of the complement Wi \ ∪j6=iWj, the

statement follows by some homotopy.

i and x2 ∈ W 2

(C) When codimWi (Wi ∩ Wj ) = 1 the subspaces Wi and Wj are decomposed by the
j ∪ W 2
hyperplane Wi ∩ Wj into unions of closed half-spaces, Wi = W 1
j ,
i and W 1
respectively. Let us assume that x1 ∈ W 1
j
glued along the common boundary and compactiﬁed determine a sphere S ⊂ ˆE. Since the
Ziegler-ˇZivaljevi´c decomposition [19] involves a choice of generic points, the points can be
chosen in such a way that the sphere S appears in the decomposition. Precisely, the sphere
S is the factor \Wi ∩ Wj ∗ ∆(P<Wi∩Wj ) ∼= Sn−1 ∗ S0 ∼= Sn, where P denote the intersection
poset of the arrangement A. thus, the fundamental class [S] is nontrivial in Hn( ˆD(A); Z).
Like in the previous case, let ∆(S) ∈ H m(E, M (A); Z) be the Poincar´e-Alexander dual to
[S]. Then

i . The half-space W 1

i and Wj = W 1

i ∪ W 2

∆(S)([x1]) = ±1 and ∆(S)([x2]) = 0

and consequently [x1] 6= [x2].
The broken point class.
In order to simplify the exposition let A be a very special
arrangement consisting of two vector spaces W1 and W2 of the same dimension m inside the
vector space E = Rn+m. Let U = W1 ∩W2 be the intersection and k = dim(W1 ∩W2). Let us
also ﬁx V , a vector space of dimension n such that E = W1 ⊕ V = W2 ⊕ V , where ⊕ denotes
the direct sum of vector spaces. For x ∈ W1 ∩ W2 let Dε(x) be a disc x + Dε, where Dε is
the ε-disc in V . Then the broken point class of x, denoted by [x] ∈ Hn(E, E\W1 ∪ W2; Z), is
the fundamental class of the pair (Dǫ(x), ∂Dǫ(x)). In addition the image kxk := ∂[x] of the
broken point class [x] by the isomorphism Hn(E, E\W1 ∪ W2; Z) → Hn−1(E\W1 ∪ W2; Z)
is also called the broken point class of x and has all the properties of the original one.
An illustration for the case m = 1 and n = 2 can be seen in the ﬁgure 2. The same deﬁnition
stands even if W1 and W2 are closed half spaces intersecting over linear space U . The broken
point classes can be naturally expressed as linear combinations of the ordinary point classes.
The third picture in the ﬁgure 2 illustrates this situation.
Let us now suppose that k = dim(W1 ∩ W2) = dim(W1) − 1 = m − 1. Then there are two
diﬀerent broken point classes associated to every point x ∈ W1 ∩ W2, i.e. the broken point
class [x] depends on the choice of the vector space V . Let us omit the format proof of this
fact and illustrate this situation by the ﬁgure 3. The formal proof would go along the lines
of the proposition 9. The main property that diﬀers these two classes, brusquely explained,
is that if we substitute each sphere with the disc and move these discs a little bit:
1 and W −

(A) the ﬁrst disc will intersect simultaneously W +
(B) the second disc will intersect simultaneously W +

1 and W +

The coinvariants. When time comes to compute coinvariants the best news would be
that the Poincar´e-Alexander duality map and the Universal coeﬃcient isomorphism are
equivariant maps. Then the isomorphisms (2) would be isomorphisms of Q4n-modules,
and there would be no diﬀerence in what module we work. (Un)fortunately, the Poincar´e-
Alexander duality map is not a Q4n-map, but a Q4n-map up to a orientation character, while
Universal coeﬃcient isomorphism is an Q4n-map. If o is an orientation of the Q4n-sphere
Sn−1 or S2(n−1), then o determines Poincar´e-Alexander duality map γo [10]. In particular,
g · o = det(g) · o, where g ∈ Q4n ⊆ GLn(R), or g ∈ Q4n ⊆ GL2n(R).
The natural Q4n-action on the union ∪
A(J , α), inherited from the ambient Q4n-action,
respects the dimensional decomposition (3) of the (n− 4)-homology. When these homologies

b

13

are free, then the decomposition (4) becomes true even without Hom. Let us assume that
(n− 4)-homology of the arrangement
A(J , α) is free. In some calculation we will see that we
actually do not need the whole group to be free, but just some factors in the decomposition
(4). Therefore, if we would rather work with Q4n-module Hn−4(∪
A(J , α); Z) instead of
Q4n-module H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z) we have to modify the Q4n-action. Speciﬁcally, let
l ∈ Hn−4(∪

A(J , α); Z) and g ∈ Q4n, then

g ∗ l = det(g) g · l

on Hn−4(∪
form g ∗ x − x, g ∈ Q4n, x ∈ Hn−4(

A(J , α), Z). Then there is an isomorphism

The torsion of the coinvariants. The proposition 8 directs us to search for the obstruc-
tion cohomology class in the torsion part of the coinvariants. Therefore, if the coinvariants
are free, then the obstruction is zero and the map exists. Thus everythig we have done is
in vain. It is of utmost importance to get a feeling, when some G arrangement can produce
nontrivial torsion group in appropriate coinvariant group.
Let us discuss a few simple examples, which met all the above assumptions. These examples
come from the fan partition problems, and we work with cyclic groups in order to simplify
computations.

Example 11 Let A be the minimal Z8 arrangement in R8 containing subspace

L = {x ∈ R4 | x1 + x2 = x3 + x4 = x5 + x6 = x7 + x8 = 0} ⊂ W8.

The group Z8 = hεi acts by a cyclic permutation, i.e. ε · (x1, .., x8) = (x8, x1, .., x7). Then
det(ε) = (−1)8+1.
It is not hard to see that A = {L, εL, L ∩ εL}, L ∩ εL = {0}, and consequently the by Z-Z
decomposition (3),

H4(∪

Let l and ε · l be the generators of H4(∪
equality L = ε2L in R8 imply the equality l = ǫ(ε2 · l) in H4(∪
A; Z), where ǫ ∈ {1, −1}.
The sign ǫ depends on the nature of ε2. If ε2 changes the orientation of L, then ǫ = −1,
otherwise ǫ = 1. To calculate the sign ǫ we use a ε2-invariant decomposition R8 = L ⊕ L⊥,
where L⊥ denote the orthogonal complement of L. Then,

and ε2 acts on it by

ε2 · f1 = f2, ε2 · f2 = f3, ε2 · f3 = f4 − f1 − f2 − f3, ε2 · f4 = f4.

A; Z). Let us observe that

l ∼ ε ∗ l = det(ε)ε · l = −ε · l and l ∼ ε2 ∗ l = det(ε2)ε2 · l = − det(ε2) det(ε2)l = −l.

Thus, from this relations we can conclude that H2(Wn\ ∪ A; Z)Z8

∼= Z2.

Example 12 Let B be the minimal Z4 arrangement in R8 = R4 ⊕ R4 containing subspace

L = {x ∈ R8 | x1 = x5 = x1 + .. + x4 = x5 + .. + x8 = x3 + x7 = 0} ⊂ W4 ⊕ W4.

Let the action of Z4 = hεi be deﬁned by ε · (x1, .., x8) = (x4, x1, x2, x3; x8, x5, x6, x7). Then
det(ε) = (−1)4+1(−1)4+1 = 1. The arrangement A has 4 maximal elements L, εL, ε2L,

f4 = e5 + e6 + e7 + e8, f5 = e3, f6 = e7,

and ε2 acts on it by

ε2 · f1 = f5, ε2 · f2 = f2, ε2 · f3 = f6, ε2 · f4 = f4, ε2 · f5 = f1, ε2 · f6 = f3.

Since the sign of the permutation

is one then det(L∩ε2L)⊥ ε2 = 1.

In order to verify that the element ε2 does not change the orientation of the sphere \L ∩ ε2L ∗
S0, we analyze the action of ε2 on the homology H3( \L ∩ ε2L ∗ S0; Z). Since \L ∩ ε2L is a
2-sphere and, we saw, ε2 acts trivially on it, the isomorphism

(cid:18)

H3( \L ∩ ε2L ∗ S0; Z) ∼= ˜H0(S0; Z) ⊗ H2( \L ∩ ε2L; Z)
instructs us that it remains to look at the action of the ε2 on ˜H0(S0; Z). Keeping in mind
that S0 is the order complex of the lower cone of the element L ∩ ε2L, it is obvious that ε2
acts on H0(S0; Z) ∼= Z ⊕ Z by permuting generators of the two copies of Z and remembering
the orientation, i. e.

(x, y) 7→ det ε2(y, x)
Therefore, the deﬁnition of the augmentation implies that ε2 acts by multiplication on the
reduced homology ˜H0(S0; Z) ∼= Z. Thus, k = (det ε2) ε2 · k.
Again we compute the coinvariants H2(W4 ⊕ W4\ ∪ B; Z)Z4 using the modiﬁed action. The
following relations

l ∼ εi ∗ l = det(εi)εi · l = εi · l, k ∼ ε ∗ k = det(ε)ε · k = εk, k ∼ ε2 ∗ k = (det ε2)ε2 · k = k

imply that actually nothing ”torsion-like” happens and that H2(W4 ⊕ W4\ ∪B; Z)Z4

∼= Z ⊕ Z.

3.7 How to compute the obstruction cocycle

Finally, we are ready to give an algorithm for computing the cohomology class of the obstruc-
tion cocycle of the map in general position. Let us assume that additional hyper arrangement
J is already chosen.

Step 1: Let S3 be Q4n the simplicial complex earlier deﬁned. Deﬁne Q4n-map h : S3 →
It is enough to deﬁne an image of a single vertex,

Wn by deﬁning them on 0-skeleton.
because everything else is deﬁned by the equivariant request.

16

Step 2: Find all simplexes σij = [ai, ai+1; bj, bj+1] such that

h([ai, ai+1; bj, bj+1]) ∩ (L(α) ∩ J ) = {pt.}.

The intersection can’t have more than one point, because then at least the whole interval
will be in the intersection. This would mean that the map h is not in the general position.
Step 3: With the help of the cellular map between two introduced Q4n cellular structures

on S3, and previous step, count the following sets

h(e) ∩ (∪A(J , α)) and h−1(h(e) ∩ (∪A(J , α))) ⊂ e.

Step 4: Let us assume that every element y ∈ h(e) ∩ (∪A(J , α)) is contained in just one

and only one maximal element Ly of the arrangement A. Then

cQ4n (h)(e) =

I(e, Lh(x)) kh(x)k

(7)

x∈h−1(h(e)∩(∪A(J ,α)))
X

where I(h(θ), Lh(x)) is the intersection number of the oriented cell e and appropriate oriented
element Ly (Ly ∩ h(θ) = {y}) of the arrangement A(J, α).
If some y ∈ h(e) ∩ (∪A(J , α)) belongs to codimension one intersection of maximal elements
L(1)
the formulas is unchanged except the class kh(x)k is a broken point class. The
real trouble with this situation is that we need an extra eﬀort to identify this broken point
class. As we mentioned in section 3.5 the broken point class depends on the embedding of
the simplex (or its linear span) which intersects arrangement in y ∈ h(e) ∩ (∪A(J , α)).

y , .., L(k)
y

Step 5: Compute Hn−4(∪

A(J, α); Z) using decomposition (3). If there are no torsion we

actually calculated H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z).

Step 6: Compute the coinvariants H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z)Q4n by working in Q4n-module

b

Hn−4(∪

A(J , α); Z) using modiﬁed action - isomorphism (6).

Step 7: Express the obstruction element cQ4n (h)(e) ∈ H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z) as the

element of the group Hom(Hn−4(∪

b

A(J , α); Z), Z) via the isomorphism (2).

Step 8: Identify the class of the obstruction cocycle cQ4n (h)(e) in the group

b
Hn−4(∪

A(J , α), Z)/ ∼ .

If it is not zero we proved that the Q4n-map in question can not exist. Thus, propositions
4 and 5 imply that the appropriate fan partition exists. If it is zero, then the whole eﬀort
was in vane.

4 Computations and proof of theorem 2

The proof of the theorem 2 has two stages

• The proof for the wide class of special cases; in particular we prove theorem for all
n N3 ⊆ Q3 such that 2a + 2b = n, a, b ≥ 1. This proof goes along

n , a+b

n , b

α = ( a
n ) ∈ 1
the lines described in section 3.7.

• The limit argument extend the result from the class of special cases to the whole class

of triples α = (a, a + b, b) ∈ R3

>0, 2a + 2b = 1.

4.1 Finding hyper arrangement J

Before we try to prove the main theorem in steps described in the section 3.7, let us make
the fundamental step by deﬁning the additional hyper arrangement J in Rn. Let us deﬁne
hyperplanes H1, H2, K and half-spaces K +, K −, by

H1 = {x ∈ Rn| (a + b)(xa − x2a+b + x1 − xa+b+1) + xa+1 − x2a+b+1 + xn − xa+b = 0},
H2 = {x ∈ Rn| xa+1 + .. + xa+b = 0}, K = {x ∈ Rn| x1 + .. + xa+b = 0}
K + = {x ∈ Rn| x1 + .. + xa+b ≥ 0} and K − = {x ∈ Rn| x1 + .. + xa+b ≤ 0}.

The hyper arrangement J we would like to consider is

J = {H1 ∩ K +

1 , H2}.

Let us consider some properties of this arrangement which will produce crucial arguments in
the proof of the main theorem. The ﬁrst property is that εa+bH1 = H1 and εa+b does change
the orientation of the subspace H ⊥
1 . Indeed, let e = (a+ b)(ea − e2a+b + e1 − ea+b+1)+ ea+1 −
1 , then εa+b · e = (a + b)(e2a+b − ea + ea+b+1 −
e2a+b+1 + en − ea+b be a base vector of H ⊥
e1) + e2a+b+1 − ea+1 + ea+b − en. The other property is that εa+b(K + ∩ Wn) = K − ∩ Wn.

: x1 + x2 + .. + xa = xa+1 + .. + xa+b = xa+b+1 + .. + x2a+b = x2a+b+1 + .. + xn = 0.

The introduced setting provides us with the following facts:

(i) The intersection

I = L∗

1 ∩ εa+bL∗

1 ∩ εajL∗

1 ∩ ε2a+bjL∗

1 ∩ L∗

is a linear subspace of codimension one in both L∗
(ii) The following set of equalities stands

(iii) The element εa+b changes the orientation on I ⊥.

These properties will be the key arguments that the appropriate group of coinvariants
H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α), Z)Q4n have the nontrivial torsion part. The part of our arrangement
∪A(J , α) can be pictured like in the ﬁgure 6.

4.2 Step 1

Let us recall that we substituted the sphere S3 with the simplicial complex P (1)
2n ∗ P (2)
2n ,
where P2n is the regular 2n-gon. Earlier we have denoted vertices of two copies of P2n by
a1, .., a2n and b1, .., b2n, respectively. To simplify notation in calculation ahead let t = a1.
Let e1, .., en be the standard base of Rn and ui = ei − 1
n

ej, i ∈ {1, .., n}.

Figure 6: The part of the arrangement A(J , α)

We deﬁne the Q4n-map h : S3 → Wn ⊂ Rn which is in the general position by deﬁning it
on the vertex t by h(t) = u1. Then the request that h is Q4n-map imply

h(εit) = εih(t) = εi mod nh(t) = ui mod n+1
h(jt) = jh(t) = un
h(εijt) = εijh(t) = εi mod njh(t) = ui mod n.

In the future we will omit the ”mod n” part in the indexes on the right hand side, i.e. all
the indexes in Wn are calculated mod n.

4.3 Step 2

It is not hard to see from the deﬁnition that the image of the map h is h(S3) =

n

[ui, ui+1]∗

[uj, uj+1] ⊂ Wn, remembering that n + 1 is actually 1. Let us list all the simplexes of the
form [ui, ui+1] ∗ [uj, uj+1] ≡ [ui, ui+1; uj, uj+1] which intersect the subspace

i,j=1
S

L(α) = {x ∈ Wn| x1 + . . . + xa = 0, xa+1 + . . . + x2a+b = 0, x2a+b+1 + . . . + xn = 0}.

19

With a little linear algebra and combinatorics we see that the only simplexes from the image
h(S3) that intersects L(α) are:

Simplex

n u2a+b+1}

For r ∈

[2a + b + 1, n − 1]
[1, a − 1]

[a + 1, 2a + b − 1]

Whit the assumption that a, b ≥ 1 we analize two cases.

(1) If we introduce the hyperplane H1, then the only simplex that intersects L(α) ∩ H1

are

ρ1 = [ua, ua+1; u2a+b, u2a+b+1], ρ2 = [ua+b, ua+b+1; un, u1], ρ3 = [ua+b+1, ua+b+2; un, u1].

Precisely,

(L(α) ∩ H1) ∩ ρ1 = { a
(L(α) ∩ H1) ∩ ρ2 = { b

n ua + b
n ua+b + a
a+ b

n ua+1 + a

n ua+b+1 + b

n u2a+b + b
n u2a+b+1}
n un + a
n u1}
n ua+b+2+ b

n un+ a

a+b

b− b

n u1}.

(L(α) ∩ H1) ∩ ρ3 = {

a+b

n ua+b+1+

But when we add the inequality condition x1 + .. + xa+b ≥ 0, the intersection of L∗
L(α) ∩ H1 ∩ K + with the simplex ρ3 vanishes. Thus there are only two simplexes

1 =

[ua, ua+1; u2a+b, u2a+b+1] and [ua+b, ua+b+1; un, u1]

which intersects L∗

1, each of them in the single interior point,

v = a

n ua + b

n ua+1 + a

n u2a+b + b

n u2a+b+1 ∈ L∗

1 and w = b

n ua+b + a

n ua+b+1 + b

n un + a

n u1 ∈ L∗
1.

Thus, h(S3) ∩ L∗

1 = {v, w}.

(2) If we introduce the hyperplane H2 instead the hyperplane H1, there are only two

simplexes from h(S3) that intersects L∗

2 = L(α) ∩ H2. Those are

ρ1 = [ua, ua+1; u2a+b, u2a+b+1] and ρ2 = [ua+b, ua+b+1; un, u1]

and by another miracle they intersect L∗
L∗

2 = {v, w}.

2 in the same points as in the previous case, h(S3) ∩

Conclusion 13 This means that in order to analize the set h−1(h(e) ∩ (∪A(J , α))) ⊂ e we
only have to track down the pre images of v and w.

4.4 Step 3

2n ∗ P (2)

There are 16 simplexes in the sphere P (1)
simplexes [ua, ua+1; u2a+b, u2a+b+1] and [ua+b, ua+b+1; un, u1]. These simplexes are
σ2 = [ǫn+a−1t, ǫn+at; ǫ2a+bjt, ǫ2a+b+1jt],

σ1 = [ǫa−1t, ǫat; ǫ2a+bjt, ǫ2a+b+1jt],
σ3 = [ǫa−1t, ǫat; ǫn+2a+bjt, ǫn+2a+b+1jt], σ4 = [ǫn+a−1t, ǫn+at; ǫn+2a+bjt, ǫn+2a+b+1jt],
σ5 = [ǫ2a+b−1t, ǫ2a+bt; ǫajt, ǫa+1jt],
σ7 = [ǫ2a+b−1t, ǫ2a+bt; ǫn+ajt, ǫn+a+1jt], σ8 = [ǫn+2a+b−1t, ǫn+2a+bt; ǫn+ajt, ǫn+a+1jt],
θ1 = [ǫa+b−1t, ǫa+bt; jt, ǫjt],
θ3 = [ǫa+b−1t, ǫa+bt; ǫnjt, ǫn+1jt],
θ5 = [ǫ2n−1t, t; ǫa+bjt, ǫa+b+1jt],
θ7 = [ǫn−1t, ǫnt; ǫa+bjt, ǫa+b+1jt],

θ2 = [ǫn+a+b−1t, ǫn+a+bt; jt, ǫjt],
θ4 = [ǫn+a+b−1t, ǫn+a+bt; ǫnjt, ǫn+1jt],
θ6 = [ǫ2n−1t, t; ǫn+a+bjt, ǫn+a+b+1jt],
θ8 = [ǫn−1t, ǫnt; ǫn+a+bjt, ǫn+a+b+1jt]

σ6 = [ǫn+2a+b−1t, ǫn+2a+bt; ǫajt, ǫa+1jt],

By some miracle all these simplexes are in the orbit of the single simplex σ in the maximal
cell e. Moreover, the pre-images of intersection points with L∗

are all in the orbit of two points
n ǫa+bt + a
n ǫa+b−1t + b
in the simplex σ. In particular,

v∗ = a

n ǫjt and w∗ = b

n ǫa+b−1t + a

σ = [ǫa+b−1t, ǫa+bt; jt, ǫjt] = ǫjǫ−a+1σ1 = ǫ−2a−bσ2 = ǫ−n−2a−bσ3 = ǫjǫ−n−a+1σ4
= ǫ−aσ5 = ǫjǫ−n−2a−b+1σ6 = ǫjǫ−2a−b+1σ7 = ǫ−a−nσ8

= ǫjǫθ5 = ǫ−n−a−bθ6 = ǫ−a−bθ7 = ǫjǫ−n+1θ8

To illustrate the fact that points v∗ and w∗ from the cell e are mapped in the arrangement,
we track the change of the barycentric coordinates of points v, w and v∗, w∗ along the
actions. For example,

h(σ1) ∩ L∗
h(ǫajσ1) ∩ ǫajL∗
h−1 (h(ǫajσ1) ∩ ǫajL∗

(A) From σ = [ǫjt, jt; ǫa+b−1t, ǫa+bt] = ǫjǫ−a+1σ1 = ǫajσ1, we have
1 = { a
1 = { a
1) = { a
(B) From σ = [ǫa+b−1t, ǫa+bt; jt, ǫjt] = ǫ−2a−bσ2, we conclude that

Conclusion 14 Therefore,

card(h(e) ∩ (∪A(J, α))) = card(h−1(h(e) ∩ (∪A(J, α)))) = 2

and

4.5 Step 4

h−1(h(e) ∩ (∪A(J, α))) = {v∗, w∗}.

Before analyzing the obstruction cocycle, let us observe that

Then the equality 7 applied in this situation implies that the obstruction cocycle is

cQ4n (h)(e) = kh(v∗)k + kh(w∗)k

where τ1, τ2 ∈ {+1, −1}. In this situation classes kh(v∗)k and kh(w∗)k are broken point
classes determined by the h embedding of the boundary of the simplex σ, i.e. by the linear
subspace span{ua+b, ua+b+1, un, u1}.
Since, h(v∗) = ǫb · v and h(w∗) = w the obstruction cocycle is

cQ4n (h)(e) = ǫb · kvk + kwk .

where the ﬁrst broken point class is determined by the linear span of the simplex

ǫ−b[ua+b, ua+b+1, un, u1] = [ua, ua+1, u2a+b, u2a+b+1].

Also, observe that the equality

a

ǫaj · v = ǫaj ·

n ua+1 + a
and the fact that the permutation (4321) is even implies

n u2a+b + b

n u2a+b+1

n ua + b

= a

(cid:0)

n u1 + b

n un + a

n ua+b+1 + b

n ua+b = w

kwk = ǫaj · kvk .

Conclusion 15 The cohomology class of the obstruction cocycle, as we have seen, lives in
the group of coinvariants H2(Wn\∪A(J , α); Z)Q4n . Thus, instead of the original obstruction
cocycle cQ4n (h)(e) = ǫb · kvk + kwk = (ǫb + ǫaj) · kvk we can analize the cocycle

c′ = 2 kvk

where the broken point class kvk is determined by the linead span of the simplex

[ua, ua+1, u2a+b, u2a+b+1].

4.6 Step 5

Now we will ﬁnd the complete second homology H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z) via the isomorphism
(4). In order to do so we describe the ﬁrst two lower levels of the Hasse diagram of the inter-
section poset P (α) of the arangement A(J , α). With a little linear algebra and mentioned
properties of the added arrangement J , it can be seen that the n − 4 and n − 5 levels of the
Hasse diagram of the intersection poset P (α) are like in the ﬁgure 7.

Proof. For every element W ∈ P (α)<V such that dim W = n − 4 there exists a unique
element UW ∈ P (α)<V with the property dim UW = n − 5 and W < UW . There is a
monotone map f : P (α)<V → P (α)<V − {U | dim U = n − 4} deﬁned by

U 7−→

(cid:26)

U,
for dim U ≤ n − 5
UW for dim U = n − 4

which satisﬁes conditions of the Quillen ﬁber lemma. Thus, f induces a homotopy equiva-
lence and so

˜Hn−5−dim V (∆(P (α)<V )) = ˜Hn−5−dim V (∆(P (α)<V − {U | dim U = n − 4})) = 0.

because dim ∆(P (α)<V − {U | dim U = n − 4}) < n − 5 − dim V .

Conclusion 17 The previous lemma and equality impies that

H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z) ∼= Hn−4(∪

A(J , α); Z) ∼= Za+b ⊕ Z4(a+b).

4.7 Step 6

We compute Q4n coinvariants by working in the Q4n-module Hn−4(∪
A(J , α); Z) with the
modiﬁed action. Since action respects dimensional decomposition (4) we analyze n − 4 and
n − 5 dimension cases separatelly.

b

(A) Let l ∈ Hn−4(∪

A(J , α); Z) be the element which corresponds to the compactiﬁcation
2. Then l, ǫl, .., ǫa+b−1l is a base of the ﬁrst factor in the equality (8). There

of the subspace L∗
are to set identities which should be considered.
b
2 produces equality l = det(ǫa+b)ǫa+b · l = (−1)(n+1)(a+b)ǫa+b · l
2 = ǫa+bL∗
The identity L∗
in homology. Indeed, like in examples 11 and 12, we look at the orthogonal complement
2 and see that ǫa+b acts on a basis as the even permutation (3412). Then coinvariant
of L∗
calculation with modiﬁed action implies a trivial relation,

l ∼ ǫa+b ∗ l = det(ǫa+b)ǫa+b · l = det(ǫa+b)2l.

The second identity L∗
Like we mentioned, this is the consequence of the fact that ǫ−bj acts on a base of (L∗
the odd permutation (3214). Then,

2 produces equality l = (−1) det(ǫ−bj)ǫ−bj · l in homology.
2)⊥ as

2 = ǫ−bjL∗

l ∼ ǫ−bj ∗ l = det(ǫ−bj)ǫ−bj · l = − det(ǫ−bj)2 · l = −l.

Thus, the ﬁrst factor in the equality (8) reduces in the coinvariants to a single Z2.

(B) Since we want to ﬁnd the coinvariants we can concentrate on the ”genterating” part

of the Hasse diagram and its inner symmetries (ﬁgure 8)

On the other hand k + t = h. Since the sphere \L∗
1 ∗ S0 is invariant of the element
ǫa+b, there is a possible equality h = ±ǫa+b · h. Let us ﬁx the basis {e1 + .. + ea, ea+1 +

h ∼ ǫa+b ∗ h = det(ǫa+b)ǫa+b · h = − det(ǫa+b)2h = −h.

(10)

Since, ǫa+b · k − det(ǫa+b)t = det(ǫa+b)l and h = k + t, the relations 9 and 10 imply that

l ∼ det(ǫa+b)l = det(ǫa+b)(ǫa+b · k − det(ǫa+b)t) = ǫa+b ∗ k − t ∼ k − t and k + t ∼ −k − t.

Actually, we conclude that 4k = 0, or the second factor produces one Z4 .

Now we are ready to ﬁnd the image of the obstruction cocycle c′ = 2 kvk via the iso-
morphism ϑ : H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z) → Hom
. Actually we have
to compute (from (5)) the linking numbers of the sphere / boundary of the simplex S =
∂[ua, ua+1, u2a+b, u2a+b+1] (which represents the broken point class kvk) and spheres which

represents generators of the Hn(∪

non-zero values are those from the local picture Hn(
l lives in Z2 and our obstruction cocycle is 2 · (something) there is no need to compute the
image of l either.
By moving simplex [ua, ua+1, u2a+b, u2a+b+1] and analyzing its intersection with subspaces

Proof. The idea of the proof is very simple. Move our ﬁlled sphere / simplex a little
and look where it hits our arrangement and we are done. The reason for this to work is
in the deﬁnition of the linking - intersection number and the deﬃnition of (broken) point
classes. Let us recall that the linking /intersection number is ”very” invariant under small
movement of the sphere - disc. Thus if you want to check whether you calculated the
intersection number properly you move your sphere - disc and see what happens. Since
we are in linear / convex situation, besides the linking - intersection numbers (if correctly
deﬁned) are +1,-1 or 0, it is enought to consider small translatorions of a sphere - disc.

Thus, let us move our simplex σ by the generic ”small” vector s =
of complementary dimension aﬃne space span{ua+b, ua+b+1, un, u1} + s must hit all linear
spans of L∗

which implies the equivalence (12).
It looks like we forgot about the space L∗
2 and point w. The reason is that when ever we
move the simplex σ it will hit the space L∗
2. In respect of the direction we move σ the point
w will be in one or in another connecting component of L∗
2 − I. Thus, the broken point class
kwk appears in both equalities. Also, observe that we do not worry about the signs τi and
µi, they will not play any role in our calculation.

Conclusion 20 Let us observe that kv1k = ±ǫaj kv3k and kv2k = ±ǫaj kv4k. Thus, since
the class of our obstruction cocycle

c′ = 2 kvk = 2 (τ1 kv1k + τ2 kv3k + τ3 ky1k) = 2 (µ1 kv2k + µ2 kv4k + µ3 ky2k)

lives in coinvariants H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z)Q4n
cohomological cocycle

∼= Z2 ⊕ Z4 we can shift our attention to the

c′′ = 2τ3 ky1k .

4.9 Step 8

Before proving that the cohomology class of the obstruction cocycle c′′ = 2τ3 ky1k is not
zero, let us recall the nature of the Poincar´e duality isomorphism ϑ : Hm−1(Rn+m\∪A; Z) →

28

Hom(Hn(∪
T in ∪

A; Z), Z). As we have seen, for t ∈ Hn(∪

A; Z); Z) represented by a submanifold

A, the image ϑ(kxk) of t is given by the linking number

b

b

ϑ(kxk)(t) = link(S, T )..

b

Theorem 21 As we have already denoted, let l, k, h ∈ Hn−4(∪
2, \L∗
1 ∩ L∗
L∗
responding to spheres
A(J , α); Z) which contains l, k, and h such that
Hn−4(∪

2 ∗ S∗, \ǫa+bL∗

1 ∩ L∗

b

A(J , α); Z) be elements cor-
1 ∗ S∗. Then there exists a basis of

c

ϑ(ky1k)(l) = ±1, ϑ(ky1k)(k) = ±1, ϑ(ky1k)(h) = 0

(13)

b

and for every other base element d ∈ Hn−4(∪

A(J , α); Z), ϑ(ky1k)(d) = 0. Thus,

(1) ϑ(ky1k) = µ1l + µ2k ∈ Hn−4(∪
(2) c′′ = 2k 6= 0 in coinvariants H2(Wn\ ∪ A(J , α); Z)Q4n
We abuse notation in (2) and (3) using the fact that Hn−4(∪
be deleted) and omitting the notation of the cohomology class to simplify notation.

∼= Hn(∪
A(J , α); Z) is free (Hom can

A(J , α); Z) where µi ∈ {+1, −1};

A; Z)Q4n .

b

b

b

Proof. The proof can be read from the ﬁgure 9. For example, the required basis of
Hn−4(∪

A(J , α); Z) is composed of

b

(A) the orbit of l,
(B) k, h, ǫa+bh and element f corresponding to the sphere \ǫa+bL∗
(C) anything you want outside the I ”neighbourhood”, or precisely ǫk, ǫh, ǫa+b+1h, ǫf ,

1 ∩ ǫajL∗
1,

b

..., ǫa+b−1k, ǫa+b−1h, ǫn−1h, ǫa+b−1f .
This basis satisﬁes the property (13). Thus (1) and (2) follow directly with the knowing
that 4k = 0 in coinvariants.

Conclusion 22 Since we proved that the cohomology class of the obstruction cocycle is not
zero we are ready to sum up (remember Propositions 5 and 4):

There is no Q4n-map S3 → ∪A(J ,α)

=⇒ There is no Q4n-map S3 → ∪A
⇐⇒ There is no D2n-map V2(R3) → ∪A
=⇒ There is an ( a

n )-partition.

n , a+b

n , b

Once more, we have just proved that for every a, b > 1 and every two measures µ and ν on
S2, there exists an ( a

n )-partition (x; l1, l2, l3) of measures µ and ν.

n , a+b

n , b

4.10 The limit argument

The reasons for assuming nice properties for our measures will ﬁnally pop up. Let S ⊆ R3
>0
be the space of all 3-fan partitions, i.e. the space of all triples α = (a, b, c), a + b + c = 1
such that there exists an α-partition of measures µ and ν by a 3-fan. Since our measures µ
and ν are proper Borel probability measures, the space S is a closed subset of R3
>0. All we
did so far is proving the following inclusion

{( a

n , a+b

n , b

n ) ∈ Q3

>0 | 2a + 2b = n, a, b ∈ Z} ⊆ S.

The fact that S is closed implies the inclusion
>0 | a + b + c = 1} = cl{( a

{(a, b, c) ∈ R3

n , a+b

n , b

n ) | 2a + 2b = n, a, b ∈ Z} ⊆ S.

and therefore we are ﬁnally done.
