Abstract. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) project
performed its ﬁve year formal survey since Sep. 2012, already fulﬁlled the pilot survey and the
1
two years general survey with an output - spectroscopic data archive containing about 3.5
million observations. One of the scientiﬁc objectives of the project is for better understanding the
structure and evolution of the Milky Way. Thus, credible derivation of the physical properties
of the stars plays a key role for the exploration. We developed and implemented the LAMOST
stellar parameter pipeline (LASP) which can automatically determine the fundamental stellar
atmospheric parameters (eﬀective temperature Teﬀ , surface gravity log g, metallicity [Fe/H],
radial velocity Vr) for late A, FGK type stars observed during the survey. An overview of the
LASP, including the strategy, the algorithm and the process is presented in this work.

1. Introduction

LAMOST is a unique reﬂecting Schmidt telescope, with a large aperture and a wide
ﬁeld of view (Cui et al. 2012), sited at the Hebei province in China. It can simultaneously
observe 4000 celestial objects and obtain the spectra through the multi-ﬁber system.
After the previous two years commissioning survey and one year pilot survey, LAMOST
accomplished its 1st two years general survey (Zhao et al. 2012) in the period between
Sep. 2012 and Jun. 2014. The LAMOST First Data Release - DR1 (Pilot and the 1st
year survey data) published in Aug. 2013, contains more than 2.2 million spectra, the
majority of the targets are stars with a quantity of more than 1.9 million, others are
Galaxy, QSO and UNKNOWN (low S/N). The whole DR2 (DR1 plus the 2nd year
survey data, will be published at the end of 2014) sky coverage is demonstrated in the
Fig. 1. One of the two main components of the project is the LAMOST Experiment for
Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE) which is focusing on the formation
and evolution of the Milky Way (Deng et al. 2012). The LAMOST data processing and
analysis pipeline is integrated with three modulars: 2D pipeline (raw CCD data reduction,
extraction, wavelength calibration), 1D pipeline (classiﬁcation and the redshift estimation
for galaxy and QSO, Luo et al. 2012) and the LASP (Wu et al. 2011a).

2. Data and Strategy

The LAMOST spectra are with a resolving power of R∼1800 covering 3800 - 9000
˚A wavelength range. The consecutive data processing system of LAMOST is organized
with a central versioned main data base (MDB) which is supported by MySQL. The
observed data, the conventional observing information as well as all the intermediate
and ﬁnal output of each data reduction and analysis modular are all archived in this
MDB, the published spectroscopic data are in the format of ﬁts ﬁle. According to the

moon status, we approximately divided the survey into three parts: dark night, bright
night, and instrumental test night. The current selecting criteria for the LASP input are:
‘ﬁnal class’ is STAR and ‘ﬁnal subclass’ is late A or FGK type, with g band S/N > 15
and S/N > 6 for the bright and dark nights respectively.

3. Methods and Procedure

CFI method. The name CFI is an abbreviation of ‘correlation function interpolation’
(Du et al. 2012). Provided that the observed ﬂux vector is O, and the synthetic model
ﬂux vector is S, theoretically, the best-ﬁt pair is that cos<O,S > = 1. So it searchs for
the best-ﬁt by maximizing the value of cos<O,S > as functions of Teﬀ, log g and [Fe/H],
where cos<O,S > = (O ·S )/(|O |×|S |) which is referred to as correlation coeﬃcient. For
the selection of the synthetic spectral girds, CFI employed Kurucz spectrum synthesis
code based on the ATLAS9 stellar atmosphere model (Castelli & Kurucz 2003).

ULySS method. ULySS (Koleva et al. 2009, Wu et al. 2011b) determines the atmo-
spheric parameters via minimizing the χ2 between the observation and the model spec-
tra which are generated by an interpolator built based on the ELODIE stellar library
(Prugniel & Soubiran 2001,2007). The model is:

Obs(λ) = Pn(λ) × G( v , σ) ⊗ TGM( Teﬀ, log g, [Fe/H], λ), where Obs(λ) is the observed
spectrum sampled in logλ, Pn(λ) a series of Legendre polynomials of degree n, and
G( v , σ) a Gaussian broadening function parameterized by the residual velocity v, and
the dispersion σ. The multiplicative polynomial is meant to absorb errors in the ﬂux
calibration, Galactic extinction or any other source aﬀecting the shape of the spectrum.
The TGM function is an interpolator of the ELODIE library, it consists of polynomial
expansions of each wavelength element in powers of log(Teﬀ), log g, [Fe/H] and f(σ) (a
function of the rotational broadening parameterized by σ). Three sets of polynomials are
deﬁned for three temperature ranges (roughly matching OBA, FGK, and M types) with
important overlap between each other where they are linearly interpolated. The derived

intrinsic external accuracy of ULySS for the FGK stars are 43 K, 0.13 dex, and 0.05 dex
for the individual parameters (Wu et al. 2011b).

Procedure. Based on the algorithms CFI and ULySS, by ﬁtting the spectra, LASP
executed in two stages to eﬀectively derive the stellar parameters. Since the LAMOST
spectral ﬂux calibration is relative, in the 1st stage we measure the original observations,
in the 2nd stage, we measure the normalized spectra. Considering the low instrumental
response in both edges, as well as for optimizing the computing time and the storage
space, CFI and ULySS respectively select [3850, 5500] ˚A and [4100, 5700] ˚A as the ﬁtting
window. In each stage, ﬁrstly, we utilize CFI to quickly get a set of initial coarse estima-
tions, after that, by using CFI results as a guessed starting point, we adopt ULySS to
obtain more accurate and credible measurements as the ﬁnal output. CFI can rapidly se-
lect the appropriate stellar template ﬁtting range, this advantage helps eﬀectively reduce
the computational quantity and time for ULySS by using less guessed starting grid.

4. Conclusions

The data procession phase of the large survey project comprises three important tasks:
validation, calibration and in-mission software development. LASP is being improved and
will continue producing an enormous set of parameters for various stars. Thus critical
assessment of its measurements is signiﬁcant for the realization of the project’s scientiﬁc
goal. In one of the independent external validations, by comparing the common hundreds
of stars between LAMOST DR1 and the PASTEL Catalog (Soubiran et al. 2010), we
obtain precisions of 110 K, 0.19 dex, 0.11 dex and 4.91 km/s for Teﬀ , log g, [Fe/H] and Vr
respectively in the speciﬁed temperature range (Gao et al. 2014). A systemic compre-
hensive validation and calibration works according to diﬀerent spectral types and SNRs
have already been carried out, the results will be published in a separate work.

With the LAMOST DR1, a catalogue of stellar parameters which contains more than
1 million stars was simultaneous published, it has been characterized as the largest one
in the world so far. For the spectra acquired during the 2nd year survey, LASP already
preliminarily determined ∼ 0.8 million stars’ parameters. Considering the ﬁve years oper-
ation, further LAMOST survey will yield more than 6 million stars covering in a wider sky
area and depth, this will broaden the expected science especially for the characterization
of the Galaxy with more various evolutionary stages of the stars collected.
