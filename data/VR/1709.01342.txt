In the ﬁeld of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented
Reality (AR) technologies have made huge progress dur-
ing the last years [1–3] and also reached the ﬁeld of ed-
ucation [4, 5]. The virtuality continuum, ranging from
pure virtuality on one side to the real world on the other
[6] has been successfully covered by the use of immersive
technologies like head-mounted displays, which allow to
embed virtual objects into the real surroundings, leading
to a Mixed Reality (MR) experience. In such an envi-
ronment digital and real objects do not only co-exist,
but moreover are also able to interact with each other
in real-time. These concepts can be used to merge hu-
man perception of reality with digitally visualized sensor
data and thereby making the invisible visible. As a ﬁrst
example, in this paper we introduce alongside the basic
idea of this column [7] an MR-experiment in thermody-
namics for a laboratory course for freshman students in
physics or other science and engineering subjects which
uses physical data from mobile devices for analyzing and
displaying physical phenomena to students.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The paradigm experiment for heat conduction in met-
als can be realized with a metallic rod, heated on one side
while simultaneously cooled on the other [8]. Our setup
allows to observe the heat ﬂux through the rod, directly
on the real physical object, using a false-color representa-
tion. Moreover, also additional representations as, e.g.,
graphs and numerical values, can be included as digi-
tal augmentations to the real experiment, allowing for a
just-in-time evaluation of physical processes.

If the rod is perfectly isolated, after some equilibration
time the system will reach a steady state with a hot end
at temperature T1, a cold end at temperature T2, and a
constant spatial gradient along the rod axis, which allows
to calculate the thermal conductivity constant λ of the
material according to

λ =

L
A (T1 − T2)
if the constant heating power ˙Q and the dimensions, i.e.
length L and cross-section A, of the rod are known. Here

it is assumed that the full heating power ˙Q applied to
the warm end of the rod will be removed on the cold end
by cooling.

If the rod is not isolated, it moreover is possible to
calculate the loss of heat to the environment according
to h = α2λAL, using the decline factor α extracted from
an exponential ﬁt to the experimental data [9].

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

Our heat conduction experiment consists of cylindri-
cal metal sample rods with a length of L = 26 cm and
a diameter of d = 5 cm made of Aluminum and Copper,
respectively (cf. Fig. 1.b). The sample is heated at one
end with a cartridge heater and cooled at the other by a
standard CPU fan. The isolated version moreover has a
PVC insulation layer with a 3 mm slit along the rod, to
allow for thermal imaging of the rod inside (cf. Fig. 1.c).
The temperature data ﬁnally is extracted from thermal
images taken with an infrared camera placed in front of
the sample. Each pixel of the image along a ﬁxed line in
axial direction yields one temperature value, such that
the whole spatial distribution can be captured by a single
shot. The data is then passed to the Microsoft HoloLens
via WiFi, where the visualization is done. In the current
state, an App provides three diﬀerent representations of
the data: false-color image of the temperature values pro-
jected as “hologram” [10] directly onto the sample cylin-
der, numerical values at three pre-deﬁned points and a
temperature graph as a function of the position along the
rod hovering above the setup, cf. Fig. 1.a. The user may
switch the numerical and graph representation on and oﬀ
at will; moreover, it is possible to export the data as csv-
ﬁle at any time for later analysis. These functions can be
executed with the help of virtual buttons (cf. the three
white squares in Fig. 1.a) projected at the right end of
the rod which can be selected by the gaze and triggered
by hand gestures.

The beneﬁt of the MR-experiment setup is the possibil-
ity of keeping track of the real physical devices and repre-
sentations of the data simultaneously and in real-time as
the representations are continuously updated with new

case, the problem reduces to a linear ﬁt of the temper-
ature graph, yielding the slope and thus, with the help
of the constant heating power ˙Q = 50 W used in the ex-
periments via (1) the thermal conductivity constant λ.
In our tests (see Fig. 2.a,b) the isolated setup yielded a
value of λAl = (128 ± 11) Wm−1K−1 for the Aluminum
rod and λCu = (329 ± 27) Wm−1K−1 for the Copper
rod. As expected, due to the non perfect isolation of
the samples, these values are smaller than the reference
values found in literature, λAl,lit = 235 W/(m K) and
λCu,lit = 401 W/(m K), as the eﬀective heat ﬂux ˙Q along
the rod is reduced by loss to the environment.

With the help of the non-isolated rod the heat trans-
fer coeﬃcient h can be determined using the exponential
decline factor α (see Fig. 2.c,d) yielding hAl = (0.72 ±
0.01) WK−1 and hCu = (2.5 ± 0.01) WK−1, respectively.
These values are also underestimated for the same rea-
sons, however, compared to hAl,lit = (1.32 ± 0.01) WK−1
and hCu,lit = (3.05 ± 0.01) WK−1, where the literature
values for λ were used, they are reasonable regarding the
very simple insulation of the setup.

CONCLUSION

The MR experimental setup for a thermal ﬂux exper-
iment presented here, sheds new light on an experiment
well known in physics laboratory courses. The main fo-
cus of this design is to visualize the invisible and thus
to extend human perception to new regimes, e.g., tem-
perature and heat, thereby strengthening the connection
between theory and experiment. In this realization the
MR setting not only has the advantage of intrinsic con-

lows to experience an otherwise invisible quantity, like in
this case temperature, with human senses, thus extending
perception to new regimes. Furthermore, direct feedback
is implemented, such that students get an immediate im-
pression of eﬀects of the experimental parameters.

supposed to support the learning process of the students
[11, 12]. Moreover, the just-in-time evaluation of the data
yields the possibility for the students to directly examine
the process itself and the parameter involved, and imme-
diately compare the outcome to theoretical predictions
which we believe to enhance the links between theory and
experiment. Under that perspective the eﬀort to achieve
possibly more exact numerical values for quantities like
the thermal conductivity therefore seem to be less impor-
tant in this setting. Instead, the technical support during
the experimental phase will give students the possibility
to thoroughly examine the relationship between cause
and eﬀect and thus deepen their physical understanding.
