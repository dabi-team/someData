THE VIRIAL THEOREM FOR ACTION-GOVERNED THEORIES

Abstract. We describe a simple derivation of virial relations, for arbitrary physical systems
that are governed by an action. The virial theorem may be derived directly from the action, A,
with no need to go via the equations of motion, and is simply a statement of the stationarity
of the action with respect to certain variations in the degrees of freedom. Only a sub-class
of solutions that obey appropriate boundary conditions satisfy each virial relation. There
is a set of basic virial relations (one for each degree of freedom) of the form ∂Ai
c=1 = 0,
where Ai
c is the action in which one degree of freedom has been scaled by a constant factor c.
(cid:12)
Linear combinations of these may be put in simple forms, taking advantage of homogeneity
(cid:12)
properties of the action, and of dimensional considerations. When some of the degrees of
freedom are of the same type a tensor virial theorem presents itself; it may be obtained in
a similar way by considering the variation of the action under linear transformations among
these degrees of freedom. Further generalizations are discussed. Symmetries of the action may
lead to identities involving the virial relations. Beside pointing to a uniﬁed provenance of the
virial relations, and aﬀording general systematics of them, our method is a simple prescription
for deriving such relations. It is particularly useful for treating high-derivative and non-local
theories. We bring several examples to show that indeed the usual virial relations are obtained
by this procedure, and also to produce some new virial relations.

1. Introduction

In default of a general deﬁnition of the virial theorem we describe it, drawing from known
examples (see, for some of many,[1-9], and, in particular,[10]): It consists of a set of global
(integral) relations that are satisﬁed by a subclass of solutions of the equations of motion.
This sub-class is deﬁned by requiring that the solutions obey certain boundary requirements.
The derivation of these relations proceeds as follows: One contracts the equations of motion
with functions of the degrees of freedom and integrate over the variables on which the latter
depend. One then integrates by parts so as to reduce the order of derivatives, as many times
as possible–discarding boundary terms, as one proceeds, by imposing requirements on the
boundary behavior of the solutions. One ends up with a virial theorem consisting of (1) the
set of integral relations, and (2) the set of boundary conditions under which they apply.

[3][10][11-13], and the many uses described in [10] ).

The applications of this poor-man’s substitute for the equations of motion are many and
varied (see e.g.
Its usefulness draws
partly from the fact that it involves derivatives of the degrees of freedom of lower order than
appear in the equations of motion.
(We shall show, in fact, that the order of derivation
appearing is the same as that in the action itself.) Thus, for example, the applications in
astrophysics require knowledge of only particle velocities, which can be measured, and not of
the accelerations, which cannot. This feature also makes the virial theorem a useful tool for
checking numerical solutions of the equations of motion.

Here, we give a systematic treatment of the virial theorem, for arbitrary systems governed
by equations that are derived from a variational principle, in a way that highlights its origin,
and greatly facilitate its derivation in the case of higher order theories, and especially for
non-local theories.

We explain how the virial relations emerge from the action in sections 2 and 3, showing

that they are tantamount to stationarity of the action under certain increments in the degrees
of freedom; when the variation of the action under such increments may be expressed simply,
a convenient virial relation results. We demonstrate the procedure with various examples in
section 4.

2. Derivation of the virial relations from the action

Virial relations may be derived for action-governed systems as follows: The system is
1 ≤ i ≤ d, where, for each i, η(i) is the set of
described by d degrees of freedom fi[η(i)],
variables , η(i)
1 , ..., on which fi depends (time, path length, space-time coordinates for ﬁelds,
Fourier variables if the degree of freedom is described in some Fourier space, etc.). One
assumes that there exits an action A: a functional of fi, such that under a variation δfi in fi

δA =

dη(i) Qi δfi +

[Fi(δfi)]ends,

(1)

i Z

X

i
X

where Qi(f1, ..., fd, η(i)) is a functional of the degrees of freedom and a function of η(i) only;
Fi is a linear operator acting on δfi, and may depend as a functional on all the fis. The
]ends is a boundary term evaluated at the boundary of the respective η(i) space. One
term [
then postulates that the physical states are described by fis for which A is stationary under
variations δfi that annihilate the ends term. These fis are then the solutions of the equations
of motion

Qi(f1, ..., fd, η(i)) = 0

1 ≤ i ≤ d.

Consider now, as a speciﬁc change, a rescaling of a single degree of freedom fi

The change in the action is then, by eq. (1)

fi → (1 + ǫ)fi = fi + δfi.

δA = ǫ

dη(i) Qi fi + ǫ[Fi(fi)]ends.

On the other hand, we can write

Z

δA = ǫ

∂Ai

We thus have

Equation (7) is but an identity. If we now specialize to solutions of the equations of

motion (2) we get

= [Fi(fi)]ends,

c=1

(8)

is not satisﬁed by generic fi[η(i)] that are not solutions of the
which is non-trivial (i.e.
equations of motion ). It tells us that certain expressions derived from the action are pure
boundary terms.

The virial relation results when we further restrict ourselves to solutions for which the
ends terms may be discarded. This may happen because the particular fis satisfy boundary
conditions in η(i) space that render [Fi(fi)]ends zero, or, more generally, because for a large
enough η(i) volume the ends term remains ﬁnite while A becomes inﬁnite (in which case we
normalize by the volume, and the ends term vanish in the limit). We then obtain as our
desired virial relations

each satisﬁed on its own sub-class of solutions for which the ends term can be discarded.
Clearly, eq. (9) is just the relation we would get by taking the equation of motion derived by
varying A with respect to fi, then multiplying by fi, then integrating by parts as many times
as needed to reduce the order of derivatives back to that in A. The present method is then
but a way to shortcut this return journey to the equations of motion.

Linear combination of relations (9) with coeﬃcients αi–which should hold under the

appropriate boundary behavior–may be conveniently written as

where

Aα1...αd

c

≡ A(cα1 f1, ..., cαdfd).

c=1

(10)

(11)

Some of these linear combinations may be more useful than others. For example, some may
be reduced to simpler forms by employing homogeneity properties of the action, or its parts.
If there is a choice of αi for which Aα1...αd
= cβA, with β 6= 0, then, by eq. (10) , A = 0 is
one of the virial relations. (If β = 0 the d relations (9) are dependent, but the theory is then
degenerate.) This is the case for any system with a Newtonian kinetic action and harmonic
forces, in which case A = 0 implies the equality of mean kinetic and potential energies. It is
also the case for the Einstein-Hilbert action in vacuum, in which case the resulting relation
is just the integral of the trace of the equation of motion.
More generally, the action may be split into terms

c

all homogeneous with the same set of αis, but each with its own βa. Then

A =

Aa,

X

βaAa = 0

(12)

(13)

is one of the virial relations. This is the case for a system of particles with a Newtonian kinetic
action, and forces that are homogeneous in the positions (e.g power-law forces). Equation
(13) then tell us that the ratio of mean kinetic and potential energies is ﬁxed for the theory.
It is also the case for General Relativity with matter in the form of charged particles, and
electromagnetic ﬁelds (see sec. 6).

We may also apply dimensional analysis to obtain some useful combinations of the virial
relations. Suppose the action depends on some constants qp, 1 ≤ p ≤ n. Consider then,
for instance, how the diﬀerent quantities change under a change in the units of length by a
factor c. Depending on their respective dimensions, fi will change to cαifi, qp will change to
cγi qp, while A will change to cβA. (We assume that η(i) have no length dimension, as when
they denote the time, or if they do we redeﬁne them not to have such dimension, and then
we have to add to the qp another constant of the dimensions of length.) Dimensional analysis
then tells us that

A(cα1 f1, ..., cγ1 q1, ...) = cβA,

(14)

and so

Aα1...αd

c

= cβA(f1, ..., fd, c−γ1 q1, ..., c−γn qn).

From this and eq. (10) we then obtain

n

βA −

(15)

(16)

as one of the virial relations. This is particularly useful when A depends only on a small
number of constants.

3. Tensor virial theorems and further generalizations

– 3 –

Often, some of the degrees of freedom are of the same type–say fi for 1 ≤ i ≤ K,
collectively designated ~f . Then, further virial relations suggest themselves. (Examples of
degrees of freedom of the same type are the position coordinates of a particle, or indeed, of
diﬀerent particles, the components of the electromagnetic vector potential ﬁeld, the elements
of the metric tensor etc..)

We now consider the variation of the action under variations of the form

~f → M ~f ,

(17)

where M = 1 + E (with E inﬁnitesimal) is a constant K × K matrix. From eq. (1) we have

δA =

Eij

dη Qi fj + [Fi(fj)]ends

.

(18)

ij
X

(cid:20)Z

(cid:21)

(All the Qi and fi, i ≤ K, are deﬁned on the same η space.)

On the other hand, deﬁning

AM ( ~f , fK+1, ..., fD) ≡ A(M ~f , fK+1, ..., fD),

we see that

where

Thus

δA =

EijVij,

Vij ≡

(cid:12)

.

M ij =δij

Vij =

dη Qi fj + [Fi(fj)]ends.

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

As in section 2, we conﬁne ourselves to solutions of the equations of motion for which the
ends term in eq. (22) can be discarded and then

Z

Vij = 0,

(23)

which is the desired K × K-tensor virial theorem(the diagonal elements of relation (23) are
the same as eq. (9) ). In addition we still have, of course, the relations of type (9) for all the
degrees of freedom fi

i > K.

Symmetries of the action under transformations of ~f lead to constraints on the tensor
virial relations. For example, say that A is invariant under a rotations in ~f space, i.e., under
~f → U ~f , for any orthogonal matrix (continuously connected to the unit matrix). Then, from
eq. (20) ,
ij EijVij = 0 for any antisymmetric matrix E (the generators of the orthogonal
transformations). Thus, V must be a symmetric matrix: Vij = Vji is then an identity, and
there are only K(K + 1)/2 independent relations. Note that symmetries of the action do not
necessarily imply symmetries of the above type where only some of the degrees of freedom
are transformed.

P

The information held by the equations of motion on their solutions is inﬁnitely greater
than that supplied by the ﬁnite number of discrete, global relations that we have discussed so
far. It should be obvious then that one can derive an inﬁnite number of further such relations.
These emerge if we consider the variation of the action under general inﬁnitesimal increments
of the form

fi → fi + ξi(f1, ..., fd).

(24)

Here ξi may be a function of the degrees of freedom and also a functional of them, but it must,
of course, be “of the same type” as fi itself (in the sense that the action is deﬁned if we replace
fi by ξi). As before, if the ends term [Fi(ξi)]ends may be discarded, the variation of A under
(24) vanishes on solutions of the equations of motion. When, for given A and ξ, δA can be
written in a simple form–as was the case for the linear increments we had discussed earlier–a
useful relation may be obtained. The point is that because the increment (24) is deﬁned in

– 4 –

terms of the degrees of freedom themselves it enables us to formulate the extremum condition
on A, and the required boundary conditions, in terms of the fis themselves thus leading to
a virial-like relation. When it is not necessary to have a relations written in terms of system
properties alone, it may be useful to consider more general increments in which ξi is also an
explicit function of η(i). Thus considering fi → ǫijkfjfk will lead to higher-tensorial-order
relations (for a system of Newtonian particles they correspond to relations connected with
higher moments of the mass distribution–see section 5).

While these further relations are not as amenable to many of the uses as their predeces-
sors, they may be useful, depending on the particular case. For example, in connection with
checks on numerical solutions of the equations of motion the may provide checks of aspects
not covered by the basic relations (see section 4).

We have discussed virial relations as they apply to the full sub-class of solutions that
satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions. When one limits himself further to special
solution–such as ones with certain symmetry properties–the virial theorem may, in general,
be simpliﬁed; we shall not deal with such further restrictions.

4. Examples

Now let us look at some examples, mainly to demonstrate the procedure and various
relevant points discussed generally in the previous sections. We start with the archetype
of all virial theorems: that for a system of N Newtonian particles interacting via a general
N -body potential. The action for a ﬁnite time span (t1, t2) is

A = AK + AP ,

We have normalized the standard action by T ≡ t2 − t1, to make A ﬁnite for T → ∞.

The degrees of freedom are the 3N components rα

i of the positions. We get, straightfor-

wardly, from eq. (9) the 3N virial relations

hmi( ˙rα

where

hQi ≡ T −1

(29)

Usually this average is taken in the limit t1 → −∞, and t2 → ∞, and it then holds for
solutions in which all particles are bounded in a ﬁnite volume. The standard scalar virial
theorem for this case:

miv2

~ri · ~∇~ri Φ

(30)

i
(cid:10) X
is obtained by diﬀerentiating A[c~r1(t), ..., c~rN (t)] with respect to c (at c = 1). There is a

which is obtained from eq. (23) , by considering rα
j , for ﬁxed values of all indices.
Neither term is symmetric when the masses are not all equal, because neither term in the
action is symmetric under rotations in conﬁguration space. The standard tensor virial theorem

i → rα

i + ǫrβ

is obtained by taking the trace over the particle indices, or by considering rα
all values of i but ﬁxed α, β.

The kinetic term is now identically symmetric because the kinetic action is symmetric under

~∇~ri Φ which vanishes identically if Φ is rotationally invariant, in which case relation (32) is
identically symmetric in αβ.

(cid:11)

We now add a ﬁeld degree of freedom by considering a system of N gravitation particles
of masses mi and we also want to solve for the (Newtonian) gravitational ﬁeld ϕ(~r) which is
thus also a degree of freedom. The action is

Beside the scalar and tensor virial relations we wrote in the previous example (with
i miϕ[~ri(t)]), we now have a relation resulting from ϕ → cϕ which is
Φ[~r1(t), ..., ~rN (t)] =

captures more of the information in the equation of motion. By choosing J properly we may
accentuate diﬀerent regions of space, for example regions where there are better measurements,
or where better approximations can be made.

(cid:11)

(cid:11)

Consider now a system of particles governed by a general kinetic action, so the action is

of the form

A = AK[~r1(t), ..., ~rN (t), q1, ..., qn] − T −1

Φ[~r1(t), ..., ~rN (t)] dt.

(37)

Z

where AK is a general functional of the particle trajectories ~ri(t) (including higher-derivative
or, indeed, non-local actions, in which case the full world lines of the particles are integrated
on), and qp are constants. We apply eq. (16) noting that β = 2 (with our choise of normal-
ization A has dimensions of energy), and that Φ must be of the form

Φ = Φ0φ(~r1/l, ..., ~rN /l).

(38)

Here, Φ0, and l are constants with the dimensions of energy and length, respectively. Thus,
we obtain in generalization of the scalar virial theorem resulting from ~ri(t) → (1 + ǫ)~ri(t) (see
[13])

δgµνT µνg1/2d4x [14] ; so,
tensor, Tµν, is such that under a change δgµν we have δA ≡ (1/2)

requirements for this type of relation is satisﬁed if the metric becomes ﬂat at spatial inﬁnity
(so no gravitational waves escape to inﬁnity), and if there are periodic boundary conditions
in time (e.g. a stationary solution).

R

There is also homogeneity under Aα → cAα, which gives a virial relation

2AEM + Ae = 0

(50)

(requiring that no EM waves escape to inﬁnity).

There are tensor virial theorems for gµν and for Aα; the latter, for example, gotten by

considering Aα → Aα + ǫAβ reads

All these relations may be easily derived from the equations of motion, as is always the case
with low-order theories. We bring them here to show how they follow from our systematic
procedure, by mere inspection of the action, and without having to derive the equations of
motion ﬁrst.

By employing a more general conformal increment

eq. (49) generalizes to

gµν → gµν + ǫJ(gµν, Aα, ..)gµν,

[−(8πG)−1R + T ]Jg1/2d4x = 0,

(52)

(53)

and there is a similar generalization for eq. (50) .

The action may have terms quadratic in the curvature tensor–as is the case for the ﬁrst

order semi-classical corrections to General Relativity obtained from string theory–such as

R2g1/2d4x,

RµνRµνg1/2d4x,

These are invariant under gµν → cgµν, and do not modify relation (49) . In order to capture
them in a virial relation we may need to employ a tensor relation, or use one that is induced
by increments of type (24) .
