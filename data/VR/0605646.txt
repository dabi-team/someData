On the Iron content of NGC 1978 in the LMC: a metal rich,
chemically homogeneous cluster1

Francesco R. Ferraro2, Alessio Mucciarelli2, Eugenio Carretta 3, Livia Origlia3

ABSTRACT

We present a detailed abundance analysis of giant stars in NGC 1978, a mas-
sive, intermediate-age stellar cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud, characterized
by a high ellipticity and suspected to have a metallicity spread. We analyzed 11
giants, all cluster members, by using high resolution spectra acquired with the
UVES/FLAMES spectrograph at the ESO-Very Large Telescope. We ﬁnd an iron
content of [Fe/H]=-0.38 dex with very low σ[Fe/H] = 0.07 dex dispersion, and a
mean heliocentric radial velocity vr = 293.1 ± 0.9 km/s and a velocity dispersion
σvr = 3.1 km/s, thus excluding the presence of a signiﬁcant metallicity, as well
as velocity, spread within the cluster.

Introduction

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the nearest galaxy of the Local Group with a very
populous system of Globular Clusters (GCs) that cover a wide range of metallicity and age.
At least three main populations can be distinguished, namely an old population, coeval with
the Galactic GC system, an intermediate population (1-3 Gyr) and a young one (< 1Gyr).

Despite its importance, there is still a lack of systematic and homogeneous works aimed
at determining the accurate chemical abundances and abundance patterns of the LMC GC
system. Starting from the ﬁrst compilation of metallicity by Sagar & Pandey (1989), the

most systematic analysis remains the work by Olszewski et al. (1991), who estimate the
metallicity of 70 LMC clusters using the Ca II triplet. Other metallicity determinations are
based on the Lick spectral indices (de Freitas Pacheco et al. 1998), integrated infrared (IR)
spectroscopy (Oliva & Origlia 1998) or derived from Str¨omgren (Dirsch et al. 2000; Larsen
et al. 2000) and Washington (Bica et al. 1998) photometry.
Detailed chemical abundances of LMC GCs from medium-high resolution spectroscopy are
still scarce. Hill et al. (2000) (hereafter H00) measured Fe, O, Al, Ca and Ti abundances
of a few giants in four GCs (namely NGC 1866, NGC 1978, ESO 121 and NGC 2257), by
using high resolution UVES spectra. Korn et al. (2000) and Korn et al. (2002) measured a
few B stars in 4 young LMC clusters and inferred chemical abundances of Fe, C, N, O and
other α-elements (see also Richtler et al. 1989). Smith et al. (2002) measured 4 giants in
NGC 1898 and NGC 2203 and obtained accurate abundances of Fe, C, N, O, Na, Sc, Ti.
Results about the chemical composition of 4 old LMC GCs (namely NGC 1989, NGC 2005,
NGC 2019 and Hodge 11) are presented by Johnson et al. (2006), based on high-resolution
spectra taken with MIKE at the Magellan telescope.

In this letter we present the ﬁrst results of an undergoing project aimed at screening
the chemical composition of a complete sample of LMC GCs and their surrounding ﬁeld
populations, by using UVES/FLAMES. The major goal of our work is to derive a new
homogeneous metallicity scale based on high resolution spectroscopy together with a detailed
description of the abundance patterns of key metals as α, iron-group and neutron-capture
elements.
The ﬁrst target observed in our survey is NGC 1978. This intermediate-age (≈3.5 Gyr,
Girardi et al. 1995) cluster is very massive (∼ 2 · 105M⊙, Westerlund 1997) and located in
a high density stellar region, about 3.5◦ north of the bar ﬁeld.
It also shows a peculiar,
very high ellipticity (ǫ = 0.3, Geisler & Hodge 1980; Fischer et al. 1992). The multicolor
BVRI photometry by Alcaino et al. (1999) has shown a broad Red Giant Branch (RGB),
consistent with a metallicity spread [Fe/H]∼0.2 dex. On the basis of this evidence, the
authors suggested the possible existence of two diﬀerent sub-populations as the result of a
merging. This scenario was furtherly supported by H00 who analyzed the high resolution
spectra of two giant stars located in the south-east region of the cluster. They found [Fe/H]=–
1.1 and -0.82 dex, with a signiﬁcant star-to-star diﬀerence (∆[Fe/H]≈0.3 dex). However, the
same stars were previously observed by Olszewski et al. (1991), who found [Fe/H]=-0.46 and
-0.38, i.e. a much higher (by a factor of ≈3) metallicity and a much smaller (∆[Fe/H]≈0.08
dex) star-to-star diﬀerence.

In order to better understand the formation and evolution of NGC 1978, a detailed high
resolution spectroscopic study of a signiﬁcant sample of cluster stars is needed. Here we

present the detailed abundance of Iron for 11 giants in NGC 1978.

2. Observations & Spectral Analysis

In order to establish whether a metallicity spread is present throughout NGC 1978,
11 RGB stars were observed in two diﬀerent runs on October 2003 (ESO Program 072.D-
0342(A)) and February 2005 (as a back-up programme within the ESO Program 074.D-
0369(A)). We used the multi-object spectrograph UVES/FLAMES (Pasquini et al. 2002),
mounted at the Kueyen 8 m-telescope (UT2) of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). The
UVES set-up (RED ARM, centered at 5800 ˚A) provides a wavelength coverage of 4800-6800
˚A and a resolution R∼ 40000. The spectra have been acquired in series of 4-6 exposures of
≈45min each, ﬂat-ﬁeld corrected and average-combined together for a total exposure time of
3-5 hrs. The ﬁnal spectra have typical S/N ≥40. The selection of the target stars is based on
our high quality near-IR photometry of the cluster by using SOFI mounted at the ESO-NTT
(Ferraro et al. 2004a; Mucciarelli et al. 2006). Fig. 1 shows the position of the 11 giants in
the IR K,(J-K) Color Magnitude Diagram (CMD). The stars are also well distributed within
the cluster area, as shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 shows an example of the ﬁnal spectra used for the spectral analysis. From the
measured radial velocity (see Table 1) we ﬁnd that all the 11 stars are cluster members, with
a mean heliocentric velocity < vr >=+293.1±0.9 km/s, and a velocity dispersion σ=3.1
km/s, in excellent agreement with the vr = +292.4±1.4 km/s, previously determined by
Olszewski et al. (1991).

The analysis of the chemical abundances was performed using the ROSA package (Grat-
ton 1988). The line equivalent widths (EWs) of the observed spectra have been measured by
Gaussian ﬁtting the line proﬁles, adopting a relationship between EW and FWHM (see e.g.
Bragaglia et al. 2001); an iterative clipping average over a fraction of the highest spectral
points around each line has been applied to derive a local continuum. The details of the line
list and the corresponding atomic parameters are given in Gratton et al. (2003). The stellar
temperatures (Tef f ) have been estimated using the IR (J-K) color and the transformations
by Alonso et al. (1999, 2001) and Montegriﬀo et al. (1998). Since the diﬀerence between the
two temperature scales in the cool regime is always < 50 K, we adopted the average of the
two values. Gravity has been estimated accordingly to the location of the stars in the CMD
and using a theoretical isochrone of ∼3 Gyr and Z=0.008 from Cariulo et al. (2004), by
assuming a stellar mass of 1.37 M⊙, a distance modulus of (m − M)0=18.5 (van den Bergh
1998), a reddening of E(B-V)=0.1 (Persson et al. 1983) and the interstellar extinction law
deﬁned by Rieke & Lebofsky (1985). For the bolometric corrections we used those computed

– 4 –

by Montegriﬀo et al. (1998). Note that a slightly diﬀerent choice of the isochrone metallicity
indeed, by varying the former by
has a negligible impact on the inferred stellar gravity:
a factor of 2, the mass changes by ≈0.03 M⊙ which translates into a gravity variation of
≈0.01 dex. Conversely diﬀerent assumption for the cluster age can have some impact, we
ﬁnd that a 1 Gyr age variation implies a 0.05 dex gravity variation. Accordingly to Magain
(1984) prescriptions, the microturbulence velocity vt (see Table 1) is obtained by removing
the residual trend of the derived FeI abundances with the predicted line strengths X (deﬁned
as log gf − θχ), using a large number (typically 70-80) of FeI lines for each star. ATLAS
model atmospheres with convective overshooting by Kurucz (1993) are used to perform the
abundance analysis.

Table 1 shows the adopted atmospheric parameters and the values of [Fe/H]I 1 and
[Fe/H]II for all the program stars. The NF eI and NF eII number of lines used to derive the
abundance are also listed. We adopt reference solar log n(FeI)=7.54 and n(FeII)=7.49 for
neutral and ionized Fe, respectively (see Gratton et al. 2003). Given the low temperature
of the observed stars and in order to avoid spurious eﬀects due to line blending, only a few
safe lines were used to derive the FeII abundance. In particular, for three stars (namely,
NGC1978-21, NGC1978-34, NGC1978-23) no good lines are available.
Plots reported in Fig. 4 represent a test to the validity of our analysis. In particular, the
absence of any trend of ∆(F eI)/∆(χ) (where χ is the excitation potential) with respect to
Tef f (mid panel of Figure 4) supports the reliability of our temperature scale2. Similarly,
the absence of trend in upper panel is a good proof of the correctness of our microturbulent
velocities. We underline this point because H00 estimated (for similar stars in this cluster)
a larger value (tipically vt ∼ 1.9 km/s). This diﬀerence is clearly due to the diﬀerent
metodology used to calculate this parameter: H00 used the observed EWs and not, as we
do, the expected line strengths.

3. Results and discussion

Our spectroscopic analysis based on 11 cluster member stars provides an average iron
abundance from neutral FeI lines of [Fe/H]I=–0.38±0.02 dex and [Fe/H]II=–0.26±0.02 dex

1We adopt the usual spectroscopic notation:

[A]=log(A)star-log(A)⊙ for any abundance quantity A;

log(A) is the abundance by number of the element A in the standard scale where log(H)=12.

2We estimate that the typical Tef f derived from excitation equilibrium should be lower by δT ∼ 75 ± 100
K with respect to the photometric estimates. This systematic turns out to be comparable with internal
errors in Tef f .

from singly ionized lines. The overall metallicity dispersion is σ=0.07 dex. The overall
error budget in [Fe/H] has been computed accordingly to the uncertanties in the adopted
atmospheric parameters and in the measured EWs. Uncertainties in temperatures (typically
± 60 K) are estimated by taking in account the errors of the infrared colors (typically
δ(J − K) ∼ 0.02 mag) and reddening (δE(B − V ) ∼ 0.02 mag). The uncertainty in gravity
(± 0.08 dex) is obtained by quadratically summing uncertainties in temperature, in distance
modulus and in bolometric correction. 1σ random error (± 0.11 km/s) in microturbolent
velocity has been estimated from the slope of the abundance/line strenght relation. The
internal errors in [A/H] are typically less than 0.10 dex. Finally, the contribution of the
EW measurement uncertainties to the abundance error budget was estimated by dividing
the average rms scatter of FeI lines (assumed to represent the error of each individual line)
by the square root of the number of lines. Considering all these errors sources we obtain a
total uncertanty of ±0.07 dex for [Fe/H]I and ±0.17 dex for [Fe/H]II, fully consistent with
the (low) cluster metallicity dispersion. This conﬁrms the high homogeneity level in iron
content of this cluster3.

Our average metallicity is in good agreement with the previous estimate by Olszewski
et al. (1991), who obtained [Fe/H]=–0.42±0.04, while both these estimates disagree with
the signiﬁcant lower abundance ([Fe/H]=–0.96±0.15) found by H00. Unfortunately we did
not re-observed the two stars measured by H00, hence no direct comparison can be done.
However, the relatively large number of giants measured in this work and the accurate tests
we perform on the abundance analysis suggested that our result is quite solid. It is also worth
noticing that high metallicity estimate for this intermediate-age cluster is in agreement with
the recent ﬁnding (see e.g. Cole et al. 2000; Smith et al. 2002; Cole et al. 2005) that the
metallicity distribution of intermediate-age LMC ﬁeld stars shows a remarkable peak in the
abundance distribution at [Fe/H]≈ −0.4 ± 0.2 dex.

Though the discussion of the overall age-metallicity relation in the LMC is beyond
the purpose of this paper, the result obtained here deserves a few considerations.
It is
interesting to note that NGC1978 is in the age range where diﬀerent star formation (SF)
models provide signiﬁcantly diﬀerent predictions in the age-metallicity relation. For example,
the predictions of the two models discussed by Pagel & Tautvaisiene (1998) (see their Figure

3A further test about the validity of our analysis was performed. We divided our sample in two sub-
groups: the ﬁrst included stars with Tef f ∼ 3750K and the second with Tef f ∼ 3850K; only the coolest star
(NGC 1978-23) is excluded. The spectra of stars in each group have been summed and high S/N combined
spectra were obtained. We repeat the abundance analysis described above, using the average atmospheric
parameters for each group. The resulting [Fe/H] from these combined spectra is in excellent agreement with
the the iron content derived from individual stellar spectra, the diﬀerence being ≤ 0.03 dex.

4), show signiﬁcant diﬀerences for clusters in the 2-10 Gyr age range. The two models are
also discussed by H00 and compared with some observations (see their Figure 4a). Here
we just note that the current age estimate for NGC1978 (≈3.5 Gyr, Girardi et al. 1995),
and our metallicity determination, place the cluster in a position within the age-metallicity
diagram more consistent with a smooth SF rather than with a bursting model. Of course
no ﬁrm conclusion can be reached on the basis of only one cluster, however we strongly
emphasize how only the combination of accurate metallicities and age determinations could
signiﬁcantly improve our knowledge in the star formation history of the LMC. Hence an
accurate determination of the NGC1978 age based on highly accurate CMD is urgent to
properly locate the cluster in the age-metallicity diagram.

NGC 1978 is one of the most massive stellar cluster in the LMC and it has been sus-
pected to harbor a chemically inhomogeneous stellar population (see Sect. 1). Note that
both the most massive stellar systems in the halos of our Galaxy (ω Cen, M ∼ 3 · 106M⊙,
Merritt, Meylan & Mayor 1997) and M31 (G1, M ∼ 7 · 106M⊙, Meylan et al. 2001) show
evidence of a metallicity spread and a complex star formation history (Ferraro et al. 2004b;
Sollima al. 2005). Curiously, both these massive stellar systems show a relatively large el-
lipticity (ǫ ≈0.2), similar to NGC 1978. These properties have been interpreted as possible
signatures of a merging event4. Hence our ﬁndings deserve a few additional comments in
the context of the cluster formation. The fact that our targets are well distributed within
the entire cluster area (see Fig. 2) and that they show an high level of homogeneity in their
Iron abundance allows us to safely conclude that NGC 1978 does not show any signature of
metallicity spread. Also, the IR CMDs presented by Mucciarelli et al. (2006) do not conﬁrm
the presence of a signiﬁcant spread along the RGB (contrary to the claim of Alcaino et al.
(1999)). Of course, our ﬁnding makes the merging hyphothesis poorly convincing since it
would require either that the two sub-units had similar metallicity or that the two gas clouds
with diﬀerent metallicities eﬃciently mixed at better than δ[F e/H] = 0.07 dex before star
formation started. Both these occurrences are quite unlikely, hence we can safely conclude
that there is not signature pointing at a merging event in the formation history of this cluster.
Moreover, previous dynamical studies of this cluster (Fischer et al. 1992) already found no
evidence for merging. Finally, it is also worth noticing that ellipticity is a common feature of
many LMC and Galactic clusters (see e.g. Goodwin 1997) with no evidence of a metallicity
spread. A few explanations for a large ellipticity, other than merging, can be advocated, the
two most likely being either cluster rapid rotation and/or strong tidal interactions with the
parent galaxy.

4Note that several clusters in the MC appear to be binary (or show cluster-to-cluster interaction).
