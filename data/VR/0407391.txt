ABSTRACT
In response to criticism by Momany et al. (2004), that the recently-identiﬁed Canis
Major (CMa) overdensity could be simply explained by the Galactic warp, we present
proof of the existence of a stellar population in the direction of CMa that cannot
be explained by known Galactic components. By analyzing the radial distribution of
counts of M-giant stars in this direction, we show that the Momany et al. (2004) warp
model overestimates the number of stars in the Northern hemisphere, hence hiding the
CMa feature in the South. The use of a better model of the warp has little inﬂuence on
the morphology of the overdensity and clearly displays an excess of stars grouped at a
distance of D = 7.2 ± 0.3 kpc. To lend further support to the existence of a population
that does not belong to the Galactic disc, we present radial velocities of M-giant stars
in the centre of the CMa structure that were obtained with the 2dF spectrograph
at the AAT. The extra population shows a radial velocity of vr = 109 ± 4 km s−1,
which is signiﬁcantly higher than the typical velocity of the disc at the distance of
CMa. This population also has a low dispersion (13 ± 4 km s−1). The Canis Major
overdensity is therefore highly unlikely to be due to the Galactic warp, adding weight
to the hypothesis that we are observing a disrupting dwarf galaxy or its remnants.
This leads to questions on what part of CMa was previously identiﬁed as the Warp
and how to possibly disentangle the two structures.

INTRODUCTION

The recently-discovered Canis Major overdensity (here-
after CMa) appears to be an ongoing accretion event that
will contribute to the build-up of the Galactic thick disk
(Martin et al. 2004, hereafter Paper I). Found close to the
plane of the Milky Way disc, we argued this putative dwarf
galaxy may be the progenitor of the ‘Ring’ of stars that en-
compasses the Galaxy (Ibata et al. 2003; Crane et al. 2003),
which is seen most clearly in the Galactic anticentre di-
rection (Newberg, Yanny et al. 2002; Yanny, Newberg et al.
2003). This ‘Ring’ of stars may have been built progressively
as stars were removed from that dwarf galaxy by the disrup-
tive tidal forces of the Milky Way.

In Paper I, we extracted candidate M-giant stars from
the 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), following selec-
tion criteria used to study the tidal stream of the Sagittar-
ius dwarf galaxy (Majewski et al. 2003). By comparing the

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS

M-giant distribution above and below the Galactic plane,
we brought to light several large-scale Galactic asymme-
tries that we interpreted as the CMa dwarf galaxy and
the CMa tidal stream. Bellazzini et al. (2004, hereafter Pa-
per II) presented deep photometry of a ﬁeld at 4.2◦ from
the center of CMa and of Galactic open clusters that lie
fortuitously in front of the CMa overdensity. These data
give a good constraint on the distance to this population,
(m − M) = 14.6 ± 0.3, and also constrain the dominant stel-
lar population to be of intermediate age (∼ 4–10 Gyr) and
to be metal-rich (−0.7 ≤ [M/H] ≤ 0.0).

However, Momany et al. (2004, hereafter M04) ques-
tioned the existence of the CMa overdensity. They claimed
that it could be entirely explained by a simple shift of the
Galactic plane of 2 degrees to the South to model the Galac-
tic warp that is known to exist in this part of the sky. Using
the UCAC2 proper motion catalogue, they also showed that
the M-giants composing the overdensity are rotating around

the Milky Way in a prograde manner and at a tangential ve-
locity that is compatible with the disc.

Here, we use the radial starcount distribution and the
radial velocity of M-giants in the direction of CMa to show
the CMa overdensity cannot be explained by the Warp and
that its morphology and kinematics are clearly diﬀerent from
what would be expected from the Warp. We refer the reader
to Paper II for a comparison of observations in the CMa
region with the Besan¸con model of the Galaxy (Robin et al.
2003).

Throughout this work, we assume that the Solar ra-
dius is R⊙ = 8 kpc, that the LSR circular velocity is
220 km s−1, and that the peculiar motion of the Sun is
(U0 = 10.00 km s−1, V0 = 5.25 km s−1, W0 = 7.17 km s−1;
Dehnen & Binney 1998).

criticism on the use of

To account
the
Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998, hereafter S98) values
for dust extinction (which have been claimed to overestimate
the extinction in regions of high reddening), we now use the
Bonifacio, Monai & Beers (2000, hereafter B00) asymptotic
correction of these and redeﬁne our sample of M-giants (sam-
ple A of Paper I) accordingly. The magnitudes we consider
in this letter have all been de-reddened in this way.

2.1 Distances

In Paper I, we used the Red Giant Branch of the Sagittarius
dwarf galaxy as a reference to calculate the distances to
the M-giant stars in our sample A. As we already noted,
the uncertainty on the metallicity and age of the diﬀerent
stellar populations leads to a possible ∼ 30% uncertainty on
the distances, with the values obtained being a lower limit.
Since the present argument on the existence of an over-
density in Canis Major is mainly based on distance distribu-
tions, it is desirable to have an independent and more robust
method to validate our distance estimates. Therefore, we
ﬁrst apply the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) algo-
rithm of McConnachie et al. (2004), which they used to de-
termine the distances to the M31 group of dwarf galaxies. As
has been explained there, the I-magnitude has the advantage
of being only slightly dependent on metallicity. It is therefore
particularly adapted for the study of the CMa population for
which the metallicity has not yet been precisely determined.
However, to account for this lack of precise metallicity,
we double the uncertainties adopted by McConnachie et al.
(2004) for the I absolute magnitude of the tip, leading to
I = −4.04 ± 0.10 (Bellazzini, Ferraro & Pancino 2001).

Since the 2MASS catalogue we are using only provides
J, H and Ks magnitudes, we cross identiﬁed our sample A
with the DENIS catalogue that contains 190 million ob-
jects down to I=18.5. With the TRGB algorithm being
sensitive to contamination from foreground stars, we study
a large area to obtain suﬃcient statistics. In the region
230◦ < l < 250◦ and −20◦ < b < −5◦, 3628 stars among the
6480 2MASS M-giant stars have their counterpart in DE-
NIS and can be used to determine the TRGB of the CMa
population.

Applying the TRGB algorithm leads to i = 10.25 ±
0.03 for the magnitude of the tip, which corresponds to a
heliocentric distance of the Canis Major population of D =
7.2 ± 0.3 kpc. This is statistically equivalent to the previous
values of 7.1 ± 1.3 kpc of Paper I and of 8 ± 1 kpc of Paper II
but with a smaller uncertainty.

With this distance modulus, we are now able to ob-
tain a photometric parallax to the CMa stars in the same
way Majewski et al. (2003) did for the Sgr stars. Using the
2MASS colour-magnitude diagram of the same region, we
compute a linear ﬁt to the Red Giant Branch (RGB) of the
CMa population. As in Majewski et al. (2003), we restrict
the ﬁt to those stars having 0.9 < J − Ks < 1.1 and apply
a 2.5σ iterative rejection algorithm to discard the contami-
nating disc stars. This leads to the following ﬁt:

Ks = −8.9(J − Ks) + 18.0

(1)

with uncertainties slightly lower than 0.1 on the values. This
result is close to the one Majewski et al. (2003) deduced for
the Sagittarius dwarf, which explains the compatibility be-
tween the TRGB estimated distance to CMa and the esti-
mate of Paper I based on the Sgr ﬁducial.

Using a TRGB algorithm and a CMD ﬁt of the slope
of the Red Giant Branch of the Canis Major population,
we have derived a relation to estimate the distance to CMa
stars. Contrary to our previous estimates, this relation does
not require the use of the Sgr RGB as a reference and should
reduce the uncertainties discussed in Paper I. Throughout
this letter, we will now use relation (1) to estimate the dis-
tance to stars in the CMa region.

2.2 The Canis Major overdensity is not the Warp

Momany et al. (2004) discarded the possibility of an un-
known population in Canis Major, arguing that the overden-
sity presented in Paper I could be accounted for by correct-
ing S98 extinction values with the asymptotic correction in-
troduced by B00 and using b = −2◦ as the symmetric plane
of the Galaxy to model the Warp in the 235◦ < l < 245◦
region.

Since the CMa overdensity appears strong and peaked
in the radial distribution of M-giants in Paper I, we checked
the assumption of M04 by studying the radial distribution
of M-giants in the same region that they used: |b′| < 20◦
and 235◦ < l < 245◦, where b′ is the Galactic latitude cal-
culated from the warped Galactic plane. This is shown on
Figure 1 with the Galactic plane taken as b = −2◦. Even
when using this simple warp model of M04, the radial dis-
tribution of M-giants in the direction of CMa shows a clear
overdensity of stars at the position we previously identiﬁed
in Paper I (centred on D = 7.2 kpc). Moreover, the star
counts of the Northern hemisphere display an asymmetric
behaviour with an overabundance of stars, with respect to
> 11 kpc. The star counts
the South, for D ∼
should be symmetric in the lower distance interval since the
Warp only begins at D ∼ 6 kpc in the direction of CMa
(Yusifov 2004, hereafter Y04). Furthermore, underestimat-
ing the displacement of the Warp at large distances should
produce an overestimate of the counts in the Southern hemi-
> 11 kpc. The low distance overestimate is to
sphere for D ∼
be expected from contamination by local dwarfs; this is an
artefact of the simple M04 warp model at short distances,

< 5 kpc and D ∼

Figure 1. Radial distribution of M-giant stars above and under
the warped Galactic plane for 235◦ < l < 245◦ and |b′| < 20,
with the Galactic latitude from the warped plane b′ = b + 2◦.
The black histogram shows the distribution of Southern (b′ < 0◦)
stars, the grey histogram that of Northern stars (b′ > 0◦). The
dotted histogram represents the extra counts of stars in the South
compared to the North and is centered on D ∼ 7–7.5 kpc. The
northern hemisphere counts also show a contamination by local
stars that leads to an overestimate of stars at short and long
distances where the counts should be symmetric.

where the warp should not have any inﬂuence. In the same
way, fainter dwarfs that are contaminating the sample are
wrongly taken as M-giants at large distances.

Due to the fact that in M04, the star counts are summed
up along the line of sight, these overestimates of the North-
ern counts hide the presence of the (Southern) CMa over-
density visible at around 7–7.5 kpc. However, since the an-
gular maximum of the Southern warp is thought to be
only 30◦ away (at l ∼ 270◦, see e.g. Djorgovski & Sosin
1989; L´opez-Corredoira et al. 2002; Y04), the Galactic warp
should indeed be taken into account when dealing with the
CMa overdensity. Therefore, we re-analyze the radial dis-
tribution, but this time using the Y04 model of the warp.
To avoid as much as possible contamination of the M-
giants by local dwarfs, we impose a low latitude cut at
|b′| = 5◦ and we restrict the color range of our stars to
0.9 < J − Ks < 1.3. These limits are particularly impor-
tant since extinction reaches high values near the plane and
even with the B00 correction, a small underestimate of the
extinction shifts red disc stars a little redder and they can
enter the M-giant selection box. Shifting the lower colour
limit to the red also minimises this contamination.

The results are shown on Figure 2 and, as could be ex-
pected from the improvement over the previous simple warp
model, the CMa overdensity becomes more clearly visible.
Reducing our sample to higher latitudes (e.g. 7◦ < |b′| <
20◦) does not aﬀect the distributions, meaning that system-
atic selection eﬀects produced be extinction are not respon-
sible for the overdensity in the Southern hemisphere. It can
also be noticed that our more conservative M-giant selection
and this better modeling of the Warp corrects the asymme-
> 11 kpc, which was

before with twice as many stars as in Figure 1.

cal dwarfs in the high distance M-giant sample. Even con-
sidering that the Y04 warp model does not have as large a
displacement as the L´opez-Corredoira et al. (2002) 2MASS-
based model (see e.g. Figure 2 of Y04), it is only at higher
distances than the bulk of the CMa overdensity that the
two models actually deviate from each other. It could also
be argued that we are in fact observing the south Warp
curling back up to the Galactic plane at the edge of the
disc as it is seen for the gaseous warp (Burton 1988). In
this case, we would indeed expect the stars to pile up along
the line of sight when the Warp returns to the mean plane.
However, this happens for the gas at much higher distances
(DGC ∼ 18 kpc) and at the estimated CMa distance, the
gaseous warp gently dives in the Southern hemisphere (as
modeled here). Therefore, a model that is highly diﬀerent
from what is currently known of the stellar/gaseous warp
should be summoned to explain the CMa overdensity in a
Warp scenario.

Thus, we have to conclude that the CMa overdensity
presented in Paper I really is an unknown feature that ap-
pears in addition to the Galactic warp.

Using the warp model changes only slightly the counts
and morphology of CMa compared to Paper I. Indeed, the
number of M-giants that belong to the overdensity only
drops by ∼ 10%, the distance to the structure is still in
the same range and in good agreement with the TRGB re-
sult presented above, and its FWHM remains the same. This
means that at this location, the Warp is only contributing a
minor number of M-giant stars compared to the CMa over-
density.

3 RADIAL VELOCITIES OF CANIS MAJOR

M-GIANTS

To study this population and other low latitude struc-
tures at higher longitude in greater depth we undertook
a series of observations on the nights of April 7-12, 2004

4

N. F. Martin et al.

with the 2-degree ﬁeld (2dF) spectrograph at the Anglo-
Australian Telescope (AAT). We employed two diﬀerent
spectrograph settings, with the 1200V grating on spectro-
◦
A at 1

graph 1 (covering 4600–5600

◦
A/pixel) and with the
◦
A,

1200R grating on spectrograph 2 (covering 8000–9000

◦
also at 1
A/pixel). While a detailed analysis of this dataset
will be presented in forthcoming papers, we focus here
on the radial velocities of stars selected to be M-giant
candidates obtained with spectrograph 1 in a ﬁeld cen-
tered on the CMa overdensity. These were chosen from the
colour-magnitude region of sample A: 0.85 < J − Ks < 1.30,
0.561(J − Ks) + 0.22 < J − H < 0.561(J − Ks) + 0.36,
and
with estimated distances (using the above calibration) in
the range 4 kpc < D < 20 kpc.

The spectra were extracted using the ‘2dfdr’ reduction
software (Taylor et al. 1996), but then calibrated in wave-
length and corrected for contamination from sky emission
using algorithms developed by our group. Using Fourier
cross-correlation methods, the velocities of the stars were
calculated by comparison to a range of radial velocity stan-
dard stars of type F–M (both dwarfs and giants). The veloc-
ity value corresponding to the template that best-matched
the spectrum of the survey star was selected. The typical re-
sulting radial velocity uncertainty of well-measured M-giant
stars was 10 km s−1 in spectrograph 1.

The top panel of Figure 3 shows the distribution of the
radial velocities of the 75 M-giant stars present in two 2dF
ﬁelds centred on the bulk of the CMa overdensity — within a
dergee of (l, b) = (240.0◦, −8.8◦) and (l, b) = (240.0◦, −6.8◦)
— and within 2 kpc of its mean distance — 5.2 kpc < D <
9.2 kpc. The most striking feature is the bimodality of the
distribution. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test shows that there
is less than 0.1% probability that this distribution is drawn
from the best single-Gaussian ﬁt of the data. Therefore, a
maximum-likelihood ﬁt of the sum of two normal distri-
butions was performed and shows a ﬁrst peak centered at
61 ± 4 km s−1 with a dispersion of 9 ± 3 km s−1 and a more
populated peak centered on 109 ± 4 km s−1, with a disper-
sion of 13 ± 4 km s−1 (see Figure 4). Taking the radial ve-
locity uncertainties into account in the maximum-likelihood
ﬁt, as estimated from the cross-correlation peak width, the
velocity dispersions of the two peaks are 0 ± 9 km s−1 and
10 ± 4 km s−1, respectively.

Since the second peak contains almost twice as many
stars as the ﬁrst and since its stars are centered around
the distance of CMa (see bottom panel of Figure 3), we
tentatively identify it with the large CMa overdensity that
appears on Figure 2. Moreover, if these stars are orbiting
the Galaxy, they have a mean rotational velocity (vrot ∼
160 km s−1) that is too low for a thin disc, and is even
low for a slower thick disc population (vrot ∼ 170 km s−1,
where we assume a circular velocity of 220 km s−1 and take
the thick asymmetric drift of −51 ± 5 km s−1 found by
Soubiran, Bienaym´e & Siebert 2003). Though the precise
kinematic properties of the outer rim of the Galactic disc
are poorly known (and extrapolations from local measure-
ments are likely to be misleading), the low observed ve-
locity dispersion is surely incompatible with a thick disc
population, which has Solar Neighbourhood velocity dis-
persions of (σU , σV , σW ) = (63 ± 6, 39 ± 4, 39 ± 4) km s−1
(Soubiran, Bienaym´e & Siebert 2003).

Figure 3. The top panel shows the distribution of radial ve-
locities of the M-giant targetted in our two 2dF ﬁelds (see text
for details). A clear bimodality is present that we ﬁt by a dou-
ble Gaussian model (thin line) using a maximum-likelihood algo-
rithm. We identify the second, more numerous population centred
on vr = 109 km s−1, as the CMa overdensity. The bottom panel
presents the expected phase space behaviour of a population of
stars orbiting around the Galaxy with a mean rotational velocity
of vrot = 240 km s−1 (full line), vrot = 200 km s−1 (dashed line)
or vrot = 160 km s−1 (dotted-dashed line). The positions of the
M-giants have been overplotted as ﬁlled circles and the mean dis-
tance of the CMa overdensity is represented by the heavy dotted
line at D = 7.2 kpc. The light dotted lines represent our distance
selection criteria for the histogram of the top panel.

double Gaussian model ﬁt to the radial velocity data displayed
on Figure 3. The contours are spaced at 1σ intervals. The radial
velocity distribution of the CMa population is well constrained,
with a mean value of 109 ± 4 km s−1 and a dispersion of 13 ±
4 km s−1.

Why the Canis Major overdensity is not due to the Warp

5

The position and dispersion of the ﬁrst peak are diﬃ-
cult to explain. Indeed, its stars appear too far away to co-
incide with a thin disc population contaminating our sam-
ple which we would expect to be located at a distance of
D ∼ 3.5 kpc at this radial velocity (assuming a circular ve-
locity of 220 km s−1). It is possible that we are signiﬁcantly
overestimating the distances to these stars; the ﬁt to the
RGB we determined in section 2 is adequate for CMa but
populations of diﬀerent metallicity and/or age could follow
a diﬀerent relation. However, the very low dispersion of the
peak is unexpected for a disc population. Another explana-
tion would be that the CMa overdensity is composed of two
populations with diﬀerent mean velocity. The low dispersion
of the two peaks, similar to what is observed in tidal streams
(see e.g. Ibata et al. 1997 for the Sgr dwarf or Ibata et al.
2004 for the M31 stream), argues in favour of an accretion
scenario.

To summarize, the observed kinematics of M-giants
stars in the centre of the CMa structure do not show a dis-
tribution that would be expected for a single disc population
or a Warp orbiting the Milky Way.

plausible scenario, it could also be interesting to see whether
the low latitude structure presented by Rocha-Pinto et al.
(2004) in the Triangulum-Andromeda direction can be ex-
plained in this way or whether it is too far away from the
Galaxy to be created by the same accretion process.

Finally and with the recent discovery of a putative dis-
tant spiral arm in (mainly) the fourth quadrant of the Milky
Way (McClure-Griﬃths et al. 2004), it is worth considering
the possibility that the CMa overdensity is in fact the pro-
longation of this spiral arm to lower longitudes. Even if their
observations do not overlap with CMa, the radial velocity
we present here could be compatible with their velocities
that reach vr ∼ 110 km s−1 at l ∼ 255◦. The age of the
CMa stars (Paper II) and the structure of the overdensity
(Paper I) would however be hard to explain in this scenario.
The confusion between the CMa overdensity and the
Warp that caught Momany et al. (2004) brings up questions
on the real nature and dimensions of the Warp. How much
of the Canis Major overdensity has until now been taken as
the Warp? Disentangling the role and extent of each may
prove to be a diﬃcult task.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The clear asymmetry in addition to the Warp in the direc-
tion of Canis Major and the peculiar radial velocity of these
stars show that there is an extra population in this direction,
rotating around the Milky Way in a prograde direction at a
lower mean rotational velocity than what would be expected
for disc stars. This structure at the edge of the disc may in-
dicate that the Galaxy shows the same kind of substructure
that were recently discovered at the edge of the disc of M31
(Ferguson et al. 2002).

As we have already mentioned in Paper I, this CMa
population could be the remnant of the accretion of a
dwarf galaxy onto the Galactic plane. With a mean value
of vr = 109 ± 4 km s−1, the radial velocities of CMa falls in
the range of the radial velocities of the grouping of globular
clusters identiﬁed in Paper I (see their Figure 12),1 while it
also correlates well with the Crane et al. (2003) radial ve-
locities of M-giants belonging to the ring-like Galactic An-
ticentre Stellar Structure. Moreover, the low dispersion of
the distribution of radial velocities of CMa M-giants is com-
patible with an accretion scenario. While this could be a
sign that the ‘Ring’ and the CMa overdensity are related, it
should also be noted that the distances to these two features
are diﬀerent. Therefore, it may not prove possible to link the
two in a direct way and would require an alternate accretion
scenario, in which the CMa dwarf has been in the process
of being accreted for a longer time than previously thought.
In this case, it would not have created the ‘Ring’ and the
CMa overdensity in the same passage around the Milky Way
but in successive orbits, with its tidal arms wrapped a few
times around the Galactic disc. If simulations reveal this is a

1 However, the prograde simulation of an accretion presented
there is not compatible with the radial velocity of the CMa ﬁeld
since it predicts a velocity ∼ 200 km s−1 for the CMa dwarf. This
is not surprising as this explorative simulation was mainly made
to see if the accretion scenario could reproduce the observations,
and the kinematic information available at that time was meagre.
