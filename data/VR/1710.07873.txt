Abstract

The directionality of millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications introduces a signiﬁcant challenge

in serving fast-rotating/moving terminals, e.g., mobile AR/VR, high-speed vehicles, trains, UAVs.This

challenge is exacerbated in mmWave systems using analog beamforming, because of the inherent non-

convexity in the analog beam tracking problem. In this paper, we obtain the Cram´er-Rao lower bound

(CRLB) of beam tracking and optimize the analog beamforming vectors to get the minimum CRLB.

Then, we develop a low complexity analog beam tracking algorithm that simultaneously optimizes the

analog beamforming vector and the estimate of beam direction. Finally, by establishing a new basic

theory, we provide the theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed analog beam tracking algorithm,

which proves that the minimum CRLB of the MSE is achievable with high probability. Our simulations

show that this algorithm can achieve faster tracking speed, higher tracking accuracy and higher data

rate than several state-of-the-art algorithms. The key analytical tools used in our algorithm design are

stochastic approximation and recursive estimation with a control parameter.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the upcoming 5th generation (5G) system, many high-throughput applications will be

implemented to meet the increasing and diverse demands from users, such as mobile aug-

mented/virtual reality (AR/VR) [2], vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure (V2V/V2I) [3], high-speed

railway [4], and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [5]. Such explosively growing data trafﬁc can be

conveyed by using higher frequency bands, e.g., millimeter-wave (mmWave) [6]–[8]. Compared

with traditional sub-6 GHz band, the propagation paths in the mmWave band are sparse, i.e.,

only the line-of-sight path and a few relatively strong reﬂected paths exist [9], [10]. To ensure

enough receive power, the antenna array with high array gain and narrow beam is needed [11],

and it is critical to track these paths fast and accurately in highly mobile conditions.

When using the large scale antenna array in the mmWave systems, it is not feasible to equip

each antenna with a radio frequency (RF) chain and an A/D (or D/A) converter due to high energy

consumption and huge hardware cost [8]. Therefore, the hybrid (analog/digital) beamforming

structure with phased antenna arrays were proposed as one of the most economical solutions [8],

[12]–[16]. In this structure, the signals of all antennas are beamformed in the analog domain by

using phase shifters, and one or several A/D (or D/A) converters are used for digital processing.

This solution has been standardized by IEEE 802.11ad [17] and IEEE 802.15.3c [18], and is

actively discussed by several 5G industrial organizations [19], [20].

For each transmitter/receiver that is conﬁgured with a phased antenna array, only a small

amount of pilot symbols can be transmitted/received at a time. This would lead to a high pilot

training overhead for each terminal and thus less resource can be used for data transmission,

which becomes even worse when the beam directions change rapidly. Hence, one fundamental

challenge of mobile mmWave communication is how to accurately track the beam directions of

enormous highly mobile terminals and achieve high data rate & low pilot overhead, which has

been recognized in the industry as one important research task for 5G mmWave and massive

MIMO systems, e.g., [21]–[25]. This challenge is exacerbated in analog beamforming systems,

where only one A/D (or D/A) converter is equipped.

In this paper, we consider an analog beamforming system model and attempt to establish a

basic theory of analog beam tracking, which has not been taken into consideration in the former

studies. An efﬁcient analog beam tracking algorithm is developed, which simultaneously achieves

fast tracking speed, high tracking accuracy, high data rate, and low complexity. We prove that

this algorithm converges to real beam directions with high probability, rather than other sub-

3

optimal beam directions, at the maximum possible convergence rate for static scenarios. We also

demonstrate that this translates into a highly accurate tracking of a large number of beams that

are rotating at a high speed1. Note that even with this simpliﬁed model, there still exist many

difﬁculties to resolve the aforementioned challenge, which are summarized as follows:

1) Given a certain beam direction estimator, its estimation accuracy will be dependent on the

pilot training beamforming vectors. Hence, the optimal beam tracking scheme should jointly

optimize the analog beamforming vectors and the beam direction estimators.

2) Since only phase shifters are programmable for the analog phased antenna arrays, the

optimization of analog beamforming vectors is a non-convex optimization problem.

3) Due to the multi-peak property of analog beam pattern, the problem of optimizing the beam

direction estimators is non-convex, and there exist multiple locally optimal stable points.

In addition, it is worth mentioning that the design concept and analytical framework proposed in

this paper can potentially be generalized to more practical models, e.g., in one of our follow-up

studies, a joint channel coefﬁcient and beam direction tracking problem is solved [26].

The main contributions and results of this paper are summarized as follows:

•

•

•

We derive the CRLB of the beam tracking problem, which is a function of the analog

beamforming vectors. Then, by optimizing among all analog beamforming vectors, we

obtain the minimum CRLB. This minimum CRLB can help us ﬁnd the optimal solution.

We develop an analog beam tracking algorithm for tracking dynamic beams, which jointly

optimizes the analog beamforming vectors and beam direction estimators. The derived

update equation of this algorithm is proportional to the imaginary part of the received

signal, which makes the algorithm have very low complexity.

Theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed tracking algorithm is provided, showing

that the minimum CRLB of the MSE is achievable under a certain condition. As the

traditional stochastic approximation and recursive estimation theory (see [27], [28]) cannot

be directly applied, we establish a new basic theory to prove the convergence and asymptotic

optimality of our algorithm in static beam tracking scenarios in three steps: First, we prove

that it converges to a set of beam directions with probability one, including the real beam

direction and some sub-optimal beam directions (Theorem 1). Second, we prove that under

1These beams may come from either the same terminal or different terminals. For each terminal, the base station should keep

track of several different beams to overcome the negative effect of channel blockage on some of the beam directions.

4

certain conditions, it converges to the real beam direction with high probability, rather than

other sub-optimal beam directions (Theorem 2). Finally, if the step-size parameters are

chosen appropriately, then the mean squared error (MSE) of this algorithm converges to the

minimum CRLB, and hence the highest convergence rate is achieved (Theorem 3). To the

extent of our knowledge, this paper presents the ﬁrst theoretical analysis on the convergence

and asymptotic optimality of the analog beam tracking problem.

Simulations in both static and dynamic beam tracking scenarios suggest that the proposed

•

algorithm can achieve faster tracking speed, lower beam tracking error, and higher data rate

than several state-of-the-art algorithms with the same pilot overhead, e.g., [17], [29]–[33]. In

particular, the numerical results in static beam tracking scenarios reveal that this algorithm

can converge quickly to the minimum CRLB, which veriﬁes the theoretical performance

limit we have derived and proved. In dynamic beam tracking scenarios, at signal-to-noise-

ratio (SNR) = 10 dB, the proposed algorithm is capable of tracking 18.33◦/s and achieve

95% capacity by inserting only 5 pilots per sec (see Table I in Section VII-B for details),

which corresponds to very fast tracking speed. In addition, this algorithm can support much

lower SNR (e.g., -5 dB) and outperform the comparison algorithms a lot.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sections II, we introduce the related work.

In Sections III, the system model is described. In Sections IV, we formulate the beam tracking

problem and obtain its performance bound. In Section V and VI, a recursive beam tracking

algorithm is designed, which is proven to converge to the minimum CRLB in static beam

tracking scenarios. In Section VII, numerical results show that this algorithm converges very

fast to the minimum CRLB in the static beam tracking scenarios and achieves a better tradeoff

curve between MSE (or data rate) vs. angular velocity in dynamic beam tracking scenarios.

A. Beam Estimation and Tracking

II. RELATED WORK

There have been a large number of studies on beam direction estimation/tracking in mmWave

systems with analog beamforming arrays. We ﬁrst review the state-of-the-art algorithms:

1) Beam estimation: This kind of methods sweep the channel with predeﬁned spatial beams

and estimate the beam directions of the channel based on these observations. According to differ-

ent sweeping methods, we divide them into three categories: 1) Exhaustive sweeping [34]–[36]:

Narrow spatial beams are used to probe the channel exhaustively. It can guarantee a thorough

observation on the channel, but the pilot training overhead increases linearly with the number of

5

antennas, which will easily go beyond the limitation of transmission resource. 2) Hierarchical

multi-resolution sweeping [5], [37]–[40]: The hierarchical multi-resolution codebooks are used

to sweep the channel. 3) Random sweeping [30]–[32]: Several random analog beamforming

vectors are used to observe the channel. Compared with the exhaustive sweeping methods, the

latter two categories can reduce the pilot overhead a lot. However, the probing beams in these

schemes might be far from the real beam directions, making the corresponding observation SNRs

too low to contribute to the beam direction estimation.

2) Beam tracking: This kind of methods take the prior information of beam directions into

account. In [33], [41]–[43], the estimated beam directions are updated based on the latest esti-

mates. In particular, the algorithms in [41], [42] use predeﬁned probing directions to exhaustively

sweep the channel in each iteration. Each time when the sweeping process is ﬁnished, the beam

direction estimates will be updated recursively by using the latest observations and estimates.

Due to the use of exhaustive sweeping in these algorithms, a large number of beam directions

should be probed in each iteration, which introduces high pilot overhead. To avoid high pilot

overhead, [43] proposed to probe several directions around the newly estimated beam directions,

and [33] used two pilots to probe two different directions within the mainlobe in each iteration.

But the optimal probing directions are not given in these algorithms. In [44], the authors start to

study the optimization of analog beamforming vectors during pilot training, which is obtained

based on the latest estimate. However, its beam direction estimation is done without using the

historical estimation information. In these studies, they did not simultaneously optimize the pilot

training beamforming vectors and design the beam tracking scheme. In addition, these works

mainly used simulation results to verify the tracking performance without theoretical analysis

on the convergence performance. However, as the beam tracking problem is non-convex, the

convergence performance analysis is quite important.

B. Theoretical Analysis with Multiple Stable Points

In [45], the authors analyzed the theoretical performance of their recursive SNR tracking

algorithm. It proved that the algorithm can converge to the optimal solution asymptotically and

approach the optimal Cram´er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). In [45], the stochastic approximation

and recursive estimation theory given in [27] was used. However, this theory is mainly designed

for the problem with a single stable point, which cannot handle the multi-stable-points beam

tracking problem directly. In [28], the authors established a new theory that takes multiple stable

6

points into consideration. A theorem was given to prove that a recursive process can converge to

a unique point within the stable point set. But it still cannot handle the beam tracking problem, in

which the algorithm should converge to the real beam direction, rather than other local optimal

stable points. Because among all the stable points, only the real beam direction can provide an

acceptable received SNR. To analyze whether a recursive process can converge to one particular

stable point or not, [46] has proposed a new theory, in which the lower bound of probability of

convergence was derived.

B. System Model

Consider a receiver with a linear antenna array in Fig. 1, where M antennas are placed

along a line, with a distance d between adjacent antennas.2 The antennas are connected through

programmable phase shifters to a single RF chain, and the phase shifters are controlled to steer

the beam. In the mmWave band, the multi-path channel model is widely used [8]. In addition,

as block fading is often assumed in most literature, the channel vector is given by

Np

hn =

βn,ℓa(xn,ℓ),

(1)

where n is the time-slot number, Np is the number of distinct propagation paths, βn,ℓ is the

complex channel coefﬁcient of the ℓ-th path,

2In practical systems, both transmitter and receiver sides should be considered. Due to the transmitter-receiver reciprocity, the
beam tracking of both sides will have similar designs. Hence, we consider beam tracking algorithm design and performance
analysis on the receiver side. In the following sections, in order to make the mathematical expressions and derivations more
concise, the transmitter is simpliﬁed by using an omnidirectional antenna model.

the angle-of-arrival (AoA), and λ is the wavelength.

Thanks to the sparsity of mmWave channel and the use of large scale antenna array, the

interference between different paths is weak in most cases [9], [10]. Motivated by this, we

assume that the single-path beam tracking is considered and multiple propagation paths can

be tracked separately by using single-path beam tracking algorithms. This assumption was also

adopted in recent studies, e.g., [33]. Meanwhile, the constant-envelope constraint in phased

antenna arrays (i.e., only phase shifters can be controlled in the analog beamforming vectors)

makes beam tracking design much harder than the conventional fully digital arrays, which in

turn renders the evaluation of fundamental limits and the development of achievable schemes

extremely difﬁcult. To that end, for analytical tractability in this paper, we will focus on the

single-path case, in which one propagation path should be tracked.

For clarity, we omit the path number ℓ. As depicted in Fig. 1, the propagation path has an

AoA θn, and its channel vector is denoted by hn = βna(xn). We assume that βn changes much

slower than the beam direction xn, hence it can be treated as a ﬁxed and known parameter in
the latter part, i.e., βn = β.3 Let wmn ∈
m-th phase shifter. Then, the analog beamforming vector steered by the phase shifters is

consideration in our follow up paper [26].

A beam tracker determines the analog beamforming vector wn and provides an estimate ˆxn
of the spatial frequency xn after applying wn.4 From a control system perspective, xn is the

system state, ˆxn is its estimate, the beamforming vector wn is the control action, and yn is a

noisy observation that is determined by a non-linear and non-convex function of the system state

xn and control action wn. In the next section, we will formulate this beam tracking problem.

IV. BEAM TRACKING AND ITS PERFORMANCE BOUND

In Section IV-A, we ﬁrst formulate the beam tracking problem. Then, in Section IV-B, we

derive a performance bound for the beam tracking problem.

A. Problem Formulation

Let ψ = (w1, w2, . . . , ˆx1, ˆx2, . . .) represent a beam tracking policy, which contains a sequence

of beamforming vectors

wn, n

and beam direction estimators

. In particular,

we consider the set Ψ of causal beam tracking policies: The estimate ˆxn of time-slot n and the

control action wn+1 of time-slot n + 1 are determined by using the history of the control actions

(w1, . . . , wn) and the observations (y1, . . . , yn). The policy ψ is to be designed to minimize the

beam tracking error in each time-slot. Given any time-slot n, the beam tracking problem can

be formulated as

4Interestingly, by tracking the spatial frequency xn, we obtain a beam tracking algorithm with better robustness than tracking

the AoA θn; see Section VI-C for details.

9

where ˆxn in constraint (8) is an unbiased estimator of xn. Problem (7) is a constrained sequential

control and estimation problem that is difﬁcult, if not impossible, to solve optimally. First, the

system is partially observed through the observation yn. Second, both the control action wn

and the estimator ˆxn need to be optimized in Problem (7): On the one hand, because only the

phase shifts (w1n, . . . , wM n) in (3) are controllable, the optimization of wn is a non-convex

optimization problem. On the other hand, as the probability density function of yn is determined

by the non-linear and non-convex function of xn as given in (6), the problem of optimizing the

estimator ˆxn is also non-convex.

B. Lower Bound of Beam Tracking Error

Next, we establish a lower bound of the MSE5 in (7) under the static beam tracking scenarios,

where xn = x for all time-slot n. Given the control actions (w1, . . . , wn), the MSE is lower

bounded by the CRLB [27]

we use MSE throughout the paper. In addition, the MSE is also a suitable performance metric for any estimators, including the
biased and unbiased ones.

V. RECURSIVE ANALOG BEAM TRACKING ALGORITHM

In this section, we will introduce our new recursive analog beam tracking algorithm, which

tells how to recursively update the beamforming vectors and the estimates according to current

observations and historical estimates.

A. Frame Structure of Beam Tracking

We ﬁrst introduce the frame structure of the transmitted signals. The transmission is divided

into two stages: 1) coarse beam sweeping and 2) recursive beam tracking. As depicted in Fig. 2,

M pilots will be received successively in Stage 1, which is assumed to obtain an initial estimate

ˆx0. In Stage 2, one pilot is allocated in each time-slot (e.g., at the beginning of each time-slot

as in Fig. 2), and the estimate ˆxn as well as the control action wn are updated iteratively.

B. Algorithm Design

Based on the frame structure introduced in Section V-A, we design a recursive analog beam

tracking algorithm as described in Algorithm 1. Then, we will clarify how Algorithm 1 is

designed. Due to the non-convex property of the beam tracking problem in (7), a good initial

estimate ˆx0 obtained in Stage 1 is quite important for the success of tracking the real direction

xn in Stage 2. As depicted in Fig. 3, we can conjecture that a good initial estimate ˆx0 should

11

be within the mainlobe set

To achieve this goal, the exhaustive sweeping is used to thoroughly probe the channel (i.e.,

by using the beamforming vectors in (14)), and motivated by the orthogonal matching pursuit

method (e.g., [31]), the initial estimate ˆx0 is obtained by projecting the observation vector on a

redundant dictionary

in (15), where the size M0 of

determines the estimation resolution

and a larger size M0 provides a more accurate initial estimate.6 Our simulations suggest that, if

VI. ASYMPTOTIC OPTIMALITY ANALYSIS

In this section, we ﬁrst present the key challenge faced by Algorithm 1. Then, a series of three

theorems will be developed to prove its asymptotic optimality in static beam tracking, which

helps resolve this challenge. Finally, we will investigate an alternative scheme that can be used

to perform beam tracking.

A. Multiple Stable Points for Recursive Procedure

To obtain the points that the recursive procedure (16) and (17) might converge to, we will in-

troduce its corresponding ordinary differential equation (ODE). Using (5) and (16), the recursive

beam tracker in (17) can also be expressed as

one of the stable points of the ODE (27). Here the stable point of the ODE (27) is deﬁned as

a point v0 that satisﬁes f (v0, xn) = 0 and f ′v(v0, xn) < 0, which means that any starting point
from the neighbourhood of v0 will make the ODE converge to v0 itself.

As depicted in Fig. 3, f (v, xn) is not monotonic in v (i.e., Problem (7) is non-convex), and

within each lobe (i.e., the mainlobe or the sidelobe) of the antenna array pattern, there exists

one stable point. The local optimal stable points for the recursive procedure are given by

Since the noise power is not zero, i.e., ρ <

mainlobe and converge to one of the sub-optimal beam directions instead of the real beam

direction, even though the initial value is within the mainlobe. Note that except for xn, the

antenna array gain is quite low at other local optimal stable points in

(xn), where the loss of

S

antenna array gain is nearly 20 dB and will be higher if more antennas are conﬁgured. Hence,

14

one key challenge is how to ensure that Algorithm 1 converges to the real direction xn, instead

of other local optimal stable points in

(xn).

B. Step-size Design and Asymptotic Optimality Analysis

In static beam tracking, we adopt the widely used diminishing step-sizes, given by [27], [28],

[46]

where α > 0 and N0 ≥

0.

an =

α

, n = 1, 2, . . . ,

(29)

The traditional theory in stochastic approximation and recursive estimation does not provide

an available method to prove the convergence to the optimal solution and the minimum CRLB

under the condition of multiple stable points (see, e.g., [27], [28]). Therefore, we refer to the

method that uses the ODE to obtain the lower bound of probability of convergence to any stable

point [46]. By using these tools, we propose a new basic theory to analyze Algorithm 1. In

particular, we now develop a series of three theorems to resolve the challenge mentioned in

Section VI-A.

Theorem 1 (Convergence to Stable Points). If an is given by (29) with any α > 0 and N0 ≥

Hence, for general step-size parameters α and N0 in (29), ˆxn converges to a stable point

(x) or a boundary point. However, as mentioned in Section VI-A, among all these stable

in

S

points, only the real beam direction x can ensure the optimum antenna array gain, which is

much higher than other local optimal stable points. Therefore, we further consider the case that

ˆxn converges to the optimum solution x.

Theorem 3 tells us that α should not be too small: If α = α∗ in (31), then the minimum CRLB

on the RHS of (13) is achieved asymptotically with high probability, which ensures the highest

convergence rate8. In practice, we suggest to choose α = α∗ and N0 = 0 in (29). Interestingly,

Theorem 3 can be readily generalized to the track of any smooth function of x:

We can design the analog beam tracking algorithm by tracking either the AoA θ or its sine

x. The algorithm that tracks the spatial frequency x is provided in Algorithm 1. The algorithm

that directly tracks the AoA θ is described in Algorithm 2.

The convergence rate of Algorithm 2 can be characterized by Corollary 1 with u(x) = arcsin x.
In particular, Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 share the same asymptotic convergence rate when ˆθn
is very close to θ. On the other hand, if ˆθn

≈

tracking performance at the beginning. As the estimate gets closer to the real value, Algorithm

2 that tracks θ starts to oscillate or even escape the mainlobe, while Algorithm 1 is stable.

In addition, (16) and (17) in Algorithm 1 are less complicated than (37) and (38) in Algorithm

1 (although both algorithms are of low complexity). Because of these reasons, we choose to track

the spatial frequency x in this paper, instead of tracking the AoA θ directly. If the AoA is needed,

then one can use the arcsin function to obtain it, i.e., θ = arcsin x.

We compare Algorithm 1 with four reference algorithms:

VII. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

1) Least squares [29]: Sweep all the beamforming directions in the DFT codebook (14) and

use the least squares algorithm to estimate the channel response hn. Then obtain the analog

beamforming vector wn for data transmission by

wmn = ∠ˆhnm, m = 1, 2,

, M,

· · ·

(39)

where ˆhnm is the m-th element of the estimated channel response ˆhn.

2) Compressed sensing [30]–[32]: Randomly choose the phase shifts wmn from

1,

j
±

}

{±

to

receive pilot signals. Then use the sparse recovery algorithm to estimate the spatial frequency

xn, where a DFT dictionary with a size of 1024 is utilized.

3) IEEE 802.11ad [17]: This algorithm contains two stages: beam sweep and beam tracking. In

the ﬁrst stage, sweep the beamforming directions in the DFT codebook (14) and choose the

direction with the strongest received signal as the best beam direction. In the second stage,

18

probe the best beam direction and its two adjacent beam directions, then choose the strongest

direction as the new best beam direction. The second stage is performed periodically.

4) Kalman ﬁlter [33]: We use the coarse beam sweeping method as given in Algorithm 1 to

provide an initial estimate for the Kalman ﬁlter based algorithm. Then, in each iteration,

two training beamforming vectors around the newly estimated AoA are used, where the

observation angles’ offsets are set as

3.5◦. These offsets ensure that the observation angles

±

are within the mainlobe. For fairness, we assume that β is known in the Kalman ﬁlter based

algorithm, and only the AoA θn need to be tracked.

Two performance metrics are considered: (i) the MSE of the channel response hn, deﬁned by

16, M0 = 2M, d = 0.5λ. In the following subsections, we will investigate the static and dynamic

beam tracking scenarios separately.

A. Static Beam Tracking

In static beam tracking scenarios, we assume that one pilot is allocated in each time-slot.

Hence, these algorithms have the same pilot overhead. The received pilot signals of all time-

slots 1, . . . , n are used for estimating xn and hn in the compressed sensing and least square

algorithms. The step-size an is given by (29) with α = α∗ and N0 = 0. The simulation results

are averaged over 10000 random system realizations, where the beam direction x is randomly

generated by a uniform distribution on [

1, 1] in each realization.

−

Figure 5 plots the convergence performance of MSEh,n over time (i.e., pilot overhead). The

MSE of Algorithm 1 converges quickly to the minimum CRLB given in (35), which agrees with

Corollary 1 and is much smaller than those of IEEE 802.11ad, least square, compressed sensing

and Kalman ﬁlter algorithms.

B. Dynamic Beam Tracking

In dynamic beam tracking scenarios, where beam direction changes over time. In the beginning,

we assume that continuous pilot training is performed and an initial estimate is obtained for all

19

Fig. 5. MSEh,n vs. time-slot number n in static beam tracking.

the algorithms. After that, one pilot is allocated in each time-slot to ensure that these algorithms

have the same amount of pilot overhead.

The last M/2 pilot signals are used in the compressed sensing algorithm and the last M

pilot signals are used in the least square algorithm. For the IEEE 802.11ad algorithm, the

probing period of its beam tracking stage is 3 time-slots. For the Kalman ﬁlter algorithm, the

probing period is 2 time-slots. These parameters are chosen to improve the performance of these

algorithms. To keep track of the changing beam direction, the step-size an of Algorithm 1 is

ﬁxed as

an = α∗ =

−
which is determined by the conﬁguration of the antenna array and is independent of the SNR ρ.

in all the time-slots. The performance of Algorithm 1 is much better than the ﬁrst three reference

algorithms, and the Kalman ﬁlter algorithm has similar performance as Algorithm 1, which is

due to that the current angular velocity is quite low.

Next, we will consider different angular velocities. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate the average AoA

angular velocity. The rotation direction δn is chosen such that θn varies within [

π/3,π/3]. We

−

can observe that Algorithm 1 can support higher angular velocities and data rates than the other

algorithms when all 16 antennas are used. In addition, by using a subset of antennas, e.g., M = 4

or 8, for beam tracking and all 16 antennas for data transmission, the beam tracking regime of

Algorithm 1 can be further enlarged.

20

Fig. 6. AoA tracking in dynamic beam tracking.

Fig. 7. Achievable rate in dynamic beam tracking.

According to Fig. 9, Algorithm 1 can achieve 95% of the channel capacity when the angular

velocity of the beam direction is 0.064 rad/time-slot, the SNR is ρ = 10 dB, and M = 8. If

each time-slot (TTI) lasts for 0.2ms (e.g., in 5G systems [49], [50]), Algorithm 1 can support

an angular velocity of 0.064

1000/0.2 = 320 rad/s

×

≈

51 circles/s. Consider a TDMA pilot

pattern where 1000 beams are tracked by the antenna array periodically in a round-robin fashion

such that 1 pilot is sent in each time-slot. Note that these beams may come from either the same

terminal or different terminals, and the base station can keep track of several different beams

for each terminal. Algorithm 1 can support 0.32 rad/s (or 18.33◦/s) per beam for tracking all

these 1000 beams, which is 72 mph if the transmitters/reﬂectors steering these beams are at a

distance of 100 meters. And when it is needed to track extremely fast mobiles, we can insert

pilot symbols with higher density (or frequency) for each mobile. For example, in the 5G NR

standard, the subcarrier spacing of mmWave band is 60 kHz and each symbol spans 17.84 µs

[51]. At this symbol rate, the proposed algorithm can track a narrow beam rotating at an angular

velocity of 2.05

105 degrees/sec. This corresponds to a rotation frequency of 411 Hz, which

×

is way beyond the need of beam tracking. Hence, the tracking speed can be very fast.

In addition, we consider the condition that SNR is ρ = 0 dB and other parameters are the same

as Figs. 8 and 9. As depicted in Figs. 10 and 11, it can be seen that Algorithm 1 can provide

higher performance gain than the condition that SNR is ρ = 10 dB, when all 16 antennas are

used. Moreover, by using M = 8 antennas for tracking and all 16 antennas for data transmissions,

the beam tracking regime of Algorithm 1 can still be enlarged. But when M = 4 antennas are

used for tracking, the performance deterioration is quite signiﬁcant due to the low antenna gain.

Therefore, when SNR is low, more antennas are needed to ensure the good tracking performance.

At last, the performance of these algorithms under different conditions is summarized in Table

I. We can observe that the maximum trackable angular velocity of Algorithm 1 to achieve 95%

capacity is much higher than those reference algorithms, and more importantly, when SNR is

equal to or lower than 0 dB, Algorithm 1 still works well under most of the conditions, while the

ﬁrst three reference algorithms cannot meet the 95% capacity requirement even if the moving

speed is zero. Hence, the proposed algorithm can achieve a much faster beam tracking speed

than the other algorithms, over a wide range of SNR values.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have developed an analog beam tracking algorithm, and established its convergence and

asymptomatic optimality. Our theoretical and simulation results show that this algorithm can

achieve faster tracking speed, lower beam tracking error, and higher data rate than several state-

of-the-art algorithms. In our future work, we will consider hybrid beamforming systems with

multiple RF chains, two-dimensional antenna arrays, and multi-path channel model with fast

fading effects, based on the methodology developed in the current paper.
