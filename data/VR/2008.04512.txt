In this work, a quasi-linear model for plasma ﬂow response to the resonant magnetic perturba-

tion (RMP) in a tokamak has been rigorously developed in the resistive-inertial (RI) and viscous-

resistive (VR) regimes purely from the two-ﬁeld reduced MHD model. Models for plasma response

to RMP are commonly composed of equations for the resonant magnetic ﬁeld response (i.e. the

magnetic island) and the torque balance of plasma ﬂow. However, in previous plasma response

models, the magnetic island and the torque balance equations are often derived separately from

reduced MHD and full MHD equations, respectively. By contrast, in this work we derive both the

magnetic island response and the torque balance equations in a quasi-linear model for plasma ﬂow

response entirely from a set of two-ﬁeld reduced MHD equations. Such a quasi-linear model can

recover previous plasma ﬂow response models within certain limits and approximations. Further-

more, the physical origins of quasi-linear forces and moments in the ﬂow response equation are also

accurately calculated and clariﬁed self-consistently.

INTRODUCTION

Resonant Magnetic Perturbation (RMP) coils have been widely equipped in fusion de-

vices due to their emerging and promising potential for controlling plasma properties and

behaviors [1–6]. For example, experiment and simulation results in J-TEXT [7] show that

RMP coils can be employed to control tearing modes and runaway electron activities [8, 9].

In the last decades, edge localized modes (ELMs) suppression and mitigation by RMPs have

been realized in various tokamaks [10–12].

It is believed that the mechanism of ELM suppression or mitigation by RMP coils is

closely connected to the plasma response to external magnetic perturbations [13–17]. Pre-

vious theory models on error ﬁeld are often directly and heuristically applied to plasma re-

sponse in both the viscous-resistive and the Rutherford regimes [14, 18], which have recently

been extended to include the two-ﬂuid and neo-classical ﬂow eﬀects [15, 16]. Predictions

from those theory models are highly relevant to the interpretation of experimental results on

the RMP-induced ELM suppression (e.g. [14, 17, 18]). Nonetheless, most previous theory

models are constructed mainly on heuristic bases instead of more rigorous or self-consistent

derivations (e.g. [14, 19]). For example, in those models, the island evolution equation for

nonlinear plasma response is derived from reduced MHD model, whereas the torque balance

equation is a direct outcome of the full MHD equations.

In this work, we propose a more self-consistent approach to the derivation of the plasma

ﬂow response model in both the resistive-inertial (RI) and viscous-resistive (VR) regimes in

cylindrical geometry within the framework of the two-ﬁeld reduced MHD equations. The

model is composed of the plasma response equation and the poloidal angular momentum

equation in the spectral space of Bessel functions. By absorbing the rigid time-dependent

ﬂow into boundary perturbation and dropping the quasi-linear magnetic terms, we extend

our previous linear plasma response solutions in slab conﬁguration [19] to cylindrical geom-

etry in presence of rigid time-dependent poloidal ﬂow for both RI and VR regimes, which

can reduce to the earlier solutions in the case of steady state ﬂow, as well as the earlier

steady state solutions of linear plasma responses in corresponding regimes for the same as-

sumptions [20]. The extension of linear plasma response solutions to allow the presence

of time-dependent in addition to steady state ﬂow, enables the construction of quasi-linear

stresses that are more self-consistent with the dynamic nature of plasma ﬂow in the plasma

3

momentum equation. After obtaining the linear plasma response solutions, we further ex-

pand the poloidal angular momentum equation including the quasi-linear stresses in the

Bessel spectral space, where the quasi-linear forces retain the Maxwell torque without any

assumption on its radial proﬁle [18]. Under certain approximations, the newly derived torque

balance equation can naturally reduce to its less complete versions in Refs. [16, 19]. The

new derivation also allows us to clarify the physical meanings of the quasi-linear forces and

moments [22].

It should be noted that the toroidal ﬂow cannot be rigorously considered within the two-

ﬁeld reduced MHD framework adopted in this work. To study the dynamics of toroidal

ﬂow, at least the four-ﬁeld reduced MHD mode or full MHD model should be used. Also,

the quasi-linear magnetic eﬀects are neglected here, which should be included in the highly

nonlinear regime where the magnetic island width is much larger than the resistive tearing

layer width. Nonetheless, the self-consistent quasi-linear plasma ﬂow response model within

the framework of two-ﬁeld reduced MHD equations should provide a solid foundation to

the building of the plasma response model including toroidal ﬂow and quasi-linear magnetic

eﬀects next.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we introduce the reduced MHD

model in the cylindrical geometry. In Sec. III, the linear plasma response solutions in the RI

and VR regimes with time-dependent ﬂow are obtained. Meanwhile, we derive the poloidal

angular momentum equation in the Bessel spectral space and construct the relevant plasma

ﬂow response model in Sec. IV. Finally, a summary and discussion is given in Sec. V.

II. TWO-FIELD REDUCED MHD MODEL

In the cylindrical coordinate system (r, θ, z), we consider the plasma response to exter-

nal magnetic ﬁeld perturbation in a low-β, large aspect ratio, periodic “straight” tokamak

equilibrium. Introducing the ﬂux function ψ and stream function φ, the magnetic ﬁeld and
velocity can be written as ~B = Bz~ez + ~ez × ∇
ﬁeld, and ~v = ~ez × ∇
ﬁeld and velocity can be neglected. Then, the incompressible two-ﬁeld reduced MHD model

III. PLASMA RESPONSE SOLUTIONS WITH TIME DEPENDENT FLOW IN

RI AND VR REGIMES

In this section, we extend the previous plasma response solutions in slab conﬁguration [19]

to cylindrical geometry in presence of time-dependent poloidal ﬂow for both RI and VR

5

regimes. This part of the work is also an extension to the previous work on linear plasma

response solution in Ref. [20], where the steady state ﬂow instead of time-dependent ﬂow

is considered. The latter extension is more consistent with the quasi-linear plasma ﬂow

response model developed later in Sec. IV, where the plasma ﬂow evolves in response to

RMP and is indeed time-dependent.

A. Plasma response equations in inner and outer regions

deﬁne δψ1(r, t) = δψ1s(r)ψs(t) + δψ1c(r)ψc(t), where ψc = δψ1(a, t) and ψs(t) = δψ1(rs, t)

represent the external RMP ﬁeld and the corresponding plasma response in magnetic ﬁeld

on the resonant ﬂux surface, respectively. Besides, δψ1s and δψ1c satisfy that

δψ1s(rs, t) = 1, δψ1s(a, t) = 0, δψ1c(rs, t) = 0, δψ1s(a, t) = 1.

Then, the index ∆′ = [d ln δψ1/dx]rs can be rewritten as ψs∆′ = ∆′0ψs+∆′cψc = [dδψ1s/dx]rsψs+

Equations similar to Eqs. (12) and (13) are ﬁrst proposed in Ref. [21], where the formulas

of solutions are given for the steady states. Here, we extend previous results in Refs. [19, 21]

to the solutions of linear plasma response in cylindrical geometry with time-dependent rigid

ﬂow in both RI and VR regimes.

where the index ∆ = ∆(ω) is also conventionally named as ∆′ in our work. The rest of

deﬁnitions are conventional and can be found following Eq. (17) of Ref. [33]. It should be

noted that the relations in above Eqs. (23)-(26) are meant for steady state. In particular,

Eq. (26) is the steady state solution of Eq. (20). Thus, Eq. (8) in Ref. [14] does not directly

derive from Eqs. (23)-(26). In this work, we transfer the eﬀect of time-dependent ﬂow into
the phases of ˆψ1 and ˆφ1, thus the resulting linearized reduced MHD equations (10) and (11)

can be solved using Laplace transform as before [19, 26]. Our linear response solutions with

time-dependent ﬂow can be straightforwardly extended to various parameter regimes.

IV. QUASI-LINEAR PLASMA FLOW RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL MAGNETIC

PERTURBATION

In previous section, we have developed a systematic derivation of the plasma response

solutions with time-dependent ﬂow in the RI an VR regimes. To close the plasma ﬂow

response model, the quasi-linear equations for the ﬂow evolution are further derived in this

section.

A. The quasi-linear angular momentum equation in the Bessel function spectral

space

We expand the poloidal angular velocity as ∆Ωθ =

∞k=0 akJ1(µk ˆr)/ˆr, where ˆr = r/a, J1
is the ﬁrst order Bessel function, and µk are the k-th zero points of J1. Then, Eq. (5) can

Since δjz1, δφ1, and δF1 are localized around the rational surface, the Maxwell and

Similar to Ref. [22], we deﬁne the quasi-linear forces and moments as the zeroth and ﬁrst

moments of the relevant stresses, where Fm and Fr are the Maxwell and Reynolds forces,

and Nm and Nr are Maxwell and Reynolds moments, respectively. They are the lowest and

10

the next order terms in Taylor expansion series of the relevant stresses in the Bessel spectral

space.

Combining Eqs. (27), (30), and (31), one obtains the following equation

(36)

The above equation reduces to the previous poloidal torque balance equation in Bessel

spectral space if one neglects Fr, Nr, and Nm [16, 25]. Diﬀerent from the conventional model

in Ref. [18], the torque balance equation in real space is not needed, nor is any assumption

on the radial proﬁle of Maxwell torque. In contrast, we construct the quasi-linear plasma

ﬂow model from the plasma response solution and the poloidal angular momentum equation

in the Bessel spectral space, which can also be extended to include the toroidal ﬂow. On

the other hand, Cole et al. [22] argue that the forces tend to cause the tearing mode locking

whereas the moments determine the evolution of the ﬂow shear. From Eq. (36), one ﬁnds

that the plasma ﬂow as well as its shear can be modiﬁed by both the forces and the moments.

We further neglect the current gradient and ﬂow shear terms, and adopt the constant-

ψ assumption. Since δjz1 is an even function of x, and δφ1 and δF1 are odd functions of

x [22, 30], one can simplify Eqs. (32)-(35) as

Note that the quasi-linear moments in this work are exactly zero. When eﬀects such as ﬂow

shear in the inner region are considered, the plasma ﬂow evolution could be signiﬁcantly

inﬂuenced by the Maxwell and Reynolds moments [22].

Note that the Reynolds force in the steady state VR regime is exactly zero. In fact, the

above expressions for the Reynolds force in the steady state RI and VR regimes diﬀer from

previous results [22]. This is because our Reynolds force is deﬁned from δφ1 and δF1 in

the inner region, whereas the Fr in the previous work is calculated using the approximated

expressions of perturbed stream function and vorticity in the outer region. On the other

hand, the above expressions of the Maxwell force in both the steady state RI and VR regimes

recover the previous results except the geometry factors [22].

C. Analytical plasma ﬂow model in presence of RMP

When the island width W is still much smaller than the resistive tearing layer width

δlayer, quasi-linear magnetic terms may be neglected. Based on the Laplace transform and

Bessel expansion, we propose a rigorous derivation for the plasma ﬂow model in response

12

to RMP in cylindrical geometry. In this model, the island evolution is determined by the

linear plasma response solutions in the constant-ψ RI and VR regimes, i.e. Eqs. (17) and

(22), which are used to obtain the equation for plasma ﬂow in the Bessel spectral space.

We further demonstrate that quasi-linear moments are exactly zero and Reynolds force can

always be neglected. We summarize the model for plasma ﬂow below

Diﬀerent from previous work, the above equations (47)-(49) are naturally derived from

the two-ﬁeld reduced MHD model. Note that the plasma response solutions in the RI and

VR regimes, i.e. Eqs. (17) and (22), are appropriate only in the small island regime. When

W

≫

δlayer, quasi-linear magnetic terms should be included.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In summary, we have developed an analytical model for the quasi-linear plasma ﬂow

response to RMP in the RI and VR regimes within the framework of two-ﬁeld reduced MHD

equations. Neglecting the quasi-linear magnetic eﬀects, previous linear solutions on plasma

response in magnetic ﬁeld [19, 20] are extended to cylindrical geometry in presence of time-

dependent rigid poloidal ﬂow for both RI and VR regimes. The extension to the linear plasma

response solutions in presence of steady state ﬂow [20] is to allow time-dependent ﬂow, which

is more consistent with the quasi-linear plasma ﬂow response model developed in this work,

where the plasma ﬂow evolves in response to RMP and is indeed time-dependent. The

corresponding plasma ﬂow response equation including the quasi-linear forces and moments

is derived in the Bessel spectral space, without invoking any assumption on the Maxwell

torque or its radial proﬁle. Diﬀerent from previous works, our analytical model is built

purely from the two-ﬁeld reduced MHD equations, which allow us to accurately calculate

and clarify the physical origins of the quasi-linear forces and moments self-consistently.

Due to the limitation of the two-ﬁeld reduced MHD model, many physics elements for the

13

RMP induced plasma response have not been included. For example, two-ﬂuid, neo-classical,

ﬁnite-orbit-width, and ﬁnite-Larmor-radius eﬀects are known to have strong inﬂuence over

tearing modes as well as plasma response to RMPs near resonant surfaces[16, 33–35]. Fur-

thermore, our derivation is appropriate only in the small island regime (W

δlayer). We

≪

plan to address these important issues in future studies.

Appendix A: Derivation of equation for ∆Ωθ

We write any quantity as f = feq + δf , where feq = feq(r) and δf = δf (r, θ, φ, t)

are the equilibrium and perturbation parts of f . We expand the perturbed quantity as

δf =

∞l=

−∞

δfleil(mθ

nφ). Using the single helicity assumption, the quasi-linear equation

for the 0/0 component of δF , i.e. δF0, can be obtained from Eq. (2)
