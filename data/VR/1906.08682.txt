Abstract – 

Falling from elevated surfaces is the main cause of 
death and injury at construction sites. Based on the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports, an average 
of nearly three workers per day suffer fatal injuries 
from falling. Studies show that postural instability is 
the foremost cause of this disproportional falling rate. 
To  study  what  affects  the  postural  stability  of 
construction  workers,  we  conducted  a  series  of 
experiments  in  the  virtual  reality  (VR).  Twelve 
healthy  adults—all  students  at  the  University  of 
Nebraska-Lincoln—were  recruited  for  this  study. 
During  each  trial,  participants’  heart  rates  and 
postural  sways  were  measured  as  the  dependent 
factors.  The  independent  factors  included  a  moving 
structural  beam  (MB)  coming  directly  at  the 
participants, 
the  presence  of  VR,  height,  the 
participants’ self-judgment of fear, and their level of 
acrophobia. The former was designed in an attempt 
to simulate some part of the steel erection procedure, 
which  is  one  of  the  key  tasks  of  ironworkers.  The 
results of this study indicate that height increase the 
postural  sway.  Self-judged  fear  significantly  was 
found to decrease postural sway, more specifically the 
normalized total excursion  of the center of pressure 
(TE), both in the presence and absence of height. Also, 
participants’  heart  rates  significantly  increase  once 
they are confronted by a moving beam in the virtual 
environment  (VE),  even  though  they  are  informed 
that the beam will not ‘hit’ them. The findings of this 
study  can  be  useful  for  training  novice  ironworkers 
that will be subjected to height and/or steel erection 
for the first time.

Introduction 

The  growing  rate  of  injuries  and  fatalities  due  to 
falling is concerning. In 2017, more than 5147 workers 
died  at  job  sites,  from  which  887  were  fall-related 
accidents  [1].  Unfortunately,  these  fall-related  losses 
have reached to the highest level in the 26-year history of 
the  Census  of  Fatal  Occupational  Injuries  (CFOI)[2]. 
This fact indicates that current safety procedures, training, 
and precautions have not adequately limited these types 
of injuries and fatalities at construction sites. 

Therefore,  numerous  research  studies  have  been 
conducted to shed lights on the important predictors of 
falling  [3].  Some  studies  presented  risk  perception  of 
construction workers as the key driver for these incidents, 
suggesting  that  the  workers’  engagement  in  unsafe 
situations  results  in  severe  injuries  and  death  [4–6]. 
These types of studies are  valuable in investigating the 
risk-taking  behavior  of  construction  workers  [7]. 
However,  the  factors  affecting  postural  stability  of  the 
workers  can  address  more  fall  incidents,  considering 
scenarios in which the worker has already executed the 
task [8].  

Postural  stability  is  the  result  of  an  association 
between  three  main  sensory  cues,  namely,  visual, 
vestibular,  and  somatosensory  systems.  The  foremost 
mission of these balance control systems is to maintain 

 
 
36th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC 2019) 

the equilibrium of the center of mass of the body against 
direct  or  indirect  stimuli.  Accordingly,  to  find  the  root 
causes of postural instability, first, one needs to discover 
these  provoking  factors.  Interestingly,  from  the  three 
sensory cues for postural stability regulation, visual input 
is  the  proactive  mechanism  of  balance,  while  the  other 
two balance mechanisms of the body, triggered after the 
external  exposure,  considered  reactive  mechanisms. 
Therefore, the focus of this study would be mainly on the 
visual 
instigating  factors. 
According  to  Hsiao  and  Simeonov,  elevation,  moving 
visual  scenes,  and  depth  perception  are  the  most 
commonly visual perturbations affecting balance [8]. Not 
only 
instigating 
mismatch and affect balance, but the exertion of anxiety 
due to the unsafe nature of these factors, especially those 
present  at  construction  sites,  will  influence  postural 
stability as well.  

these  visual  perturbations  cause 

inputs  as  the  dominant 

Following this rational, many studies strived to find 
out  the  extent  to  which  anxiety  (fear)  impact  postural 
regulation  parameters.  Interestingly,  the  result  of  these 
studies demonstrated that the presence of fear, especially 
in great extents, will negatively impact postural stability 
[9,10]. Notably, most of these research studies examined 
fear  and  acrophobia 
fear  by  utilizing  various 
questionnaires. While these ‘passive’ questionnaires are 
reliable  in  measuring  the  self-judged  level  of  anxiety, 
however,  the  need  for  more  ‘active’  methods  in 
determining  the  anxiety  level  of  construction  workers, 
subjected to fearful visual perturbations, seems necessary. 
Methods  such  as  measuring  variations  in  the  facial 
temperature [11] the level of salivary cortisol [12], and 
heart  rate  [13]  can  imply  the  anxiety  level.  The  latter 
could be misleading since many activities will impact the 
heart rate and diminish the reliability of the results. On 
the  other  hand,  measuring  heart  rate  is  simple  and 
inexpensive due to the ubiquity of smartwatches such as 
Fitbit and Apple watch. Considering the caveats above, 
this study attempts to investigate if heartrate  variability 
across  different 
is  significantly  affected  by 
provoking visual factors.   

trials 

2  Point of Departure 

The  current  study  will  reinvestigate  the  impact  of 
visual stimuli and fear on the postural stability through 
the  precise  and  realistic  simulation  of  the  environment 
and  virtual  body  parts  (mixed  reality).  In  other  words, 
this research strives to create a virtual environment (VE) 
of  the  construction  sites,  in  which  participants  will  be 
exposed to 1. extreme height and 2. a moving structural 
beam directed towards participants as a part of the steel 
erection simulation. Also, the impact of these stimuli on 
the  heart  rate  of  the  participant  will  be  measured 
precisely.  To  our  knowledge,  very  few  studies  utilize 

heart  rate  for  these  types  of  tasks  happening  at  the 
construction sites.  

3  Background 

3.1  Impact  of  height  on  the  visual  sensory 
system.  As  previously  described,  one  of  the  most 
prominent reasons behind slip, trip, and falling is the loss 
of balance. As such, finding the influential factors which 
trigger instability in humans, especially those working at 
great height, is of utmost importance. The integration of 
the  visual,  vestibular,  and  somatosensory  sensory 
systems is essential in maintaining one’s postural balance. 
Some  studies  suggest  that  visual  sensory  system  is  the 
dominant  system  in  controlling  the  human  body’s 
postural  balance  [14]  and  essential  for  maintaining 
balance [15–17]. In addition, the visual  sensory system 
can compensate for the lack of other balance-dependent 
sensory  systems,  vestibular  and  somatosensory,  in  the 
presence  of  visually-induced  disturbances.  While  each 
sensory  system’s  weight  on  the  postural  stability  is 
dependent on the environmental context and goal of the 
study  [16],  the  importance  of  visual  input  as  the 
prominent indicator of postural balance alludes that study 
of  visual  perturbations  should  be  researched  more 
extensively. Considering one in three people has visual 
height  intolerance  [18],  many  studies  suggest  height  as 
an  important  stimuli  in  provoking  gait  instability  and 
susceptibility  to  falling  [19–22].  Studies  examining 
height and fear of falling have reported that the deficit of 
close  visual  contact  due  to  the  instigating  sensory 
mismatch, and fear-related reactions, especially close to 
two  main 
edges  of  elevated  surfaces,  are 
characteristics of falling from an elevated surface [8,23]. 
Following  these  findings,  the  current  study  aims  to 
explore  the  aforementioned  instigating  factors,  height, 
and the corresponding fear, on the postural sway of the 
participants subjected to virtual height.

3.2 Fear of height. Fear is a bodily response to a 
danger  or  hazard  in  the  form  of  emotional  or  physical 
reacts.  Sometimes,  these  responses  can  be  alarming, 
and 
adversely 
performance  ranging  from  the  reluctance  of  going  to  a 
dentist  to  changes  in  the  gait  and  postural  stability  on 
elevated surfaces [24,25]. In light of the foregoing, it is 
important to consider fear and the fear of height (person’s 
level  of  acrophobia)  as  leading  factors  influencing  gait 
and  postural  stability  [26].  Accordingly,  in  the  current 
study, 
the 
two  questionnaires  were  presented 
participants, one for generally measuring fear and one for 
exclusively  measuring  the  level  of  acrophobia  of  each 
subject. Although the focus of this study is on the height-
related factors impacting safety, the circular contribution 
of visuo-vestibular to the fear and anxiety should not be 
ignored  [21].  Coelho  and  Balaban  stated  that  visuo-

relationship  between  any  of 

vestibular are not only associated with the fear of height, 
but also with panic and driving. Therefore, along with the 
acrophobia questionnaire (AQ), the famous James Geer 
fear measurement scale [27] has been utilized to pinpoint 
the  potential 
the 
aforementioned fear aspects to the changes in the gait and 
postural stability parameters. Later, it will be shown that 
those questions related to sharp objects, driving, and auto 
accident,  height,  airplane,  roller  coasters,  and  death, 
appropriately  predict  height  while  only-height  related 
questions  were 
incapable  of  addressing  postural 
parameter  changes  due  to  height.  While  these  self-
judgmental scales possibly show the self-perceived fear, 
however, the consideration of physiological responses to 
the  experiment  trials  can  be  beneficial  as  well.  The 
number of heartbeats per minute (HBM) is suggested to 
be  a  good  indicator  of  the  emotional  responses  to  the 
unexpected thread or danger [13]. Therefore, in this study, 
the  HBM  factor  was  considered  to  be  informative  and 
included in the data collection process.   

4  Methodology 

4.1  Participants.  Based  on  the  flyer  approved  by 
the  institutional  review  board  (IRB),  we  recruited  13 
students from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). 
Although randomization was considered in the recruiting 
process,  we  attempted  to  selectively  recruit  an  equal 
number  of  males  and  females,  so  that  the  potential 
influential sex factor could be precisely considered. As a 
result, six females and seven males were selected for of 
this study. The average age of the volunteers was 29 years 
old. The participants had no previous falling experience 
or any problem with standing still. 

4.2 Apparatuses and software. To measure the 
center  of  pressure  (COP)  of  the  participants  and 
consequently calculate the postural sway parameters, the 
AMTI  force  plate  was  utilized,  which  is  capable  of 
accurately calculating COP based on the reaction forces 
of  the  plate.  Later,  by  utilizing  an  in-house  code  in 
MATLAB, all the necessary parameters for the postural 
sway, and heart rate  would be imported and calculated. 
The  HTC  Vive  Pro  headset  was  selected  for  the 
immersive virtual environment demonstration. We chose 
the Vive Pro over other brands since the resolution and 
display quality of the headset is believed to be higher. As 
for the game engine software, the Unity3D software [28] 
was  used,  so  that  the  creation  of  the  immersive 
environment and all the VR simulations such as induction 
of height and the moving structural beam would be easily 
performed.  Finally,  to  collect  the  heart  rate  of  the 
participants,  we  used  a  Fitbit  Versa.  To  easily  and 
precisely  synchronize  the  heart  rate  collection  with  the 
other  devices,  a  heart  rate  collector  application  was 
developed in Fitbit studio, so that the start and stop events 

for  each  trial  could  be  triggered  on  the  Fitbit  Versa 
remotely from a smartphone. 

4.3  Questionnaires.  Prior  to  the  experiments,  to 
predict  the  participants’  self-judgment  fear  scale,  the 
electronic  version  of  James  Geer’s  questionnaire  [27] 
was presented to each participant. In addition, to measure 
their level of acrophobia, participants were asked to fill 
out  the  Cohen  acrophobia  questionnaire  (AQ)  as  well 
[29]. As mentioned before, we attempted to find out if the 
results  of  these  questionnaires  can  be  promising  in 
predicting the physiological responses such as heart rate 
or postural sway, in different study setups.  

the  participants  became 

4.4 Experiments. The first part of the experiment 
was designed to help the participants get familiar with the 
VR  environment.  The  VR  environment  was  the  same 
environment  for  all  parts  of  the  data  collection.  To 
potentially  improve  the  feeling  of  presence  in  the  VR 
environment,  the  VR  model  was  enhanced  with  virtual 
legs. To ensure that the learning curve  effect  would be 
minimal  for  the  participants,  prior  to  conducting  the 
experiment, they were asked to stand, walk, and look at 
their virtual legs for 1 minute. The force plate was placed 
on  a  specific  location  in  an  office  so  that  the  initial 
standing  position  of 
the 
designated location in the  virtual environment (VE). In 
the second part of the experiment, the participants were 
asked to stand in the center of the force plate and open 
their legs to the extent to which they are comfortable and 
most stable. After 5 seconds, the participants were asked 
to  look  at  their  feet  once,  for  2  seconds,  with  the  least 
movement  possible.  This  movement  will  affect  the 
postural stability of the participants; however, they were 
instructed  to  perform  the  same  task  in  the  other  trials. 
Therefore,  the  data  collection  would  be  consistent  and 
not  biased.  This  trial  finished  after  20  seconds.  During 
the trial, the heart rate and COP of the participants were 
retrieved.  After  the  completion  of  the  first  part,  the 
participants  were  equipped  with  the  VR  headset,  while 
they were asked to hold the initial position of their feet 
on the force plate. In the second trial, the same procedure 
as the previous trial was undertaken, however, virtually. 
The participants  were asked to look at their ‘virtual 
feet’  in  the  same  way  as  before.  To  ensure  that  the 
experiment complies with that of the quiet stance postural 
balance, no subject was allowed to look down more than 
once. After 20 seconds, a moving structural beam hung 
from  a  crane  wire,  slowly  approached  the  participants. 
The  moving  beam’s  trajectory  was  in  line  to  the 
participant’s  site  of  view.  Before  the  start  of  this  trial, 
each participant was informed that the virtual beam will 
not  ‘hit’  them  and  will  stop  1ft  away  from  their  body. 
This part of the experiment took 10 seconds to finish. The 
last  part  of  the  experiment  was  almost  identical  to  the 
second  part  of  the  experiment,  however,  this  time  the 
participants  were  placed  on  the  17th  floor  of  an 

36th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC 2019) 

unfinished  building.  The  VE,  standing  beam,  moving 
beam,  lighting,  shadows,  and  other  virtual  scenes  were 
identical to the pervious trial, except the height. Again, 
before  the  start  of  this  trial,  all  the  participants  were 
informed  that  the  moving  beam  will  slowly  approach 
them and will not ‘hit’ or ‘pass through’ them. With the 
last  10  seconds  of 
the  moving  structural  beam 
approaching the participants, the overall duration of this 
part was 30 seconds.

5  Results and Analysis 

All  the  data  was  imported  from  different  text  files 
generated throughout the experiments and then tabulated 
 for statistical analysis. By using the MATLAB statistical 
toolbox,  standard  two-tail  T-test  was  performed  on  the 
table of experiment results. It is important to note that the 
normality  of  the  data  was  tested  by  performing  the 
Anderson-Darling test [30] and turned out to be valid for 
this study. For the first part of the analysis, all the data 
was tabulated for a within-subject design case in which 
the same subjects perform in all the levels of independent 
variables.  The  result  of  the  paired  T-tests  for  such  an 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
36th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC 2019) 

analysis  can  be  investigated  in  Table  2. The  dependent 
factors  were  heart  rate  and  postural  parameters.  The 
independent variables were the presence of VR, Height, 
MB on the ground (no height), and MB at height. Four 
postural parameters were considered in this research: 1. 
Total  Excursion  (TE)  of  the  COP  throughout  the  trial 
duration,  2.  Root-mean-square  (RMS)  amplitude  is 
representing  the  variability  (standard  deviation)  of  the 
COP  displacement.  3.  Maximum  absolute  amplitude 
distance of the COP traveled during the trial duration, and 
4.  Peak-to-Peak  (PP)  amplitude  is  expressing  the 

maximum displacement shown between two COP points 
during  the  trial.  As  shown  in  Table  2,  there  was  a 
statistically significant difference between the heart rate 
of the participants subject to the MB on the ground and 
at  height  with  the  P  value  of  0.00005.  Based  on  the 
descriptive  results,  the  HRMs  of  the  participants 
increased by almost 10 percent. Another interesting case 
was the significant increase in the TE of the participants 
exposed to VR  for the  first time.  Although prior to the 
data  collection,  they  experienced  VR,  the  significant 
increases in all the postural parameters were noticeable.

Besides, Table 2 demonstrates that the  mean difference 
between the TE of the subjects collected during the quiet 
stance in VR on the ground and their TE during the quiet 
stance in VR at height was statistically significant with 

the  P  value  of  0.05.  In  other  words,  the  TE  of  the 
participants increased when they were subjected to height. 
For each trial, to measure the impact of the participants’ 
self-judged  fear  values  on  the  heart  rate  and  postural 
stability, an in-between subject design was performed on 
the  tabulated  data.  James  Geer’s  fear  questionnaire

consists of 50 questions collected based on the empirical 
data and participants’ reports [27]. The questions range 
from auto accidents, being a passenger in an airplane, and 
height to hypodermic needles, being alone, and crowded 
places.  Since  many  of  these  questions  may  not  be 
strongly  correlated  to  our  physiological  responses  at 
height, we conducted various test aimed to find out which 
of  these  questions  best  describe  the  fear  of  height. 
Considering  Coelho  and  Balaban’s  visuo-vestibular 
study [21], and the result of this study, we find out that 
“sharp edges”, “being a passenger in an airplane”, “roller 
coasters”, “death”, “heights”, “driving a car”, and “auto 
accidents”, are strongly in line with the visuo-vestibular 
predicting  factors  and  leads  to  statistically  significant 
results in our study.  To account for the factor of sex, the 
participants  were  divided  into  two  groups  of  male  and 
female, respectively. The data was then sorted based on 
the  level  of  fear  reported  by  the  subjects  and  split  into 
two groups of less fearful and more fearful subjects. The 
same procedure was undertaken for the AQ factor. The 
result  of  the  unpaired  T-tests  on  the  two  groups  of  the 
participants can be seen in table 3.

By focusing on the P values of the T-tests on each of 
the  paired  groups,  the  significant  mean  differences 
between the groups are recorded in table 3. As reported 
in this table, in VR  with  no  height and the presence of 
MB, the male group has a statistically significant lower 
average  HRM  compared 
female  group. 
Interestingly,  the  difference  between  the  RMS  of  the 
‘fearful’ and ‘non-fearful’ group was significant (P value 
=  0.023)  for  the  same  scenario,  VR  with  MB  and  no 
height.  Besides,  the  presence  of  height  in  VR  played  a 
key role in differentiating between the RMS of the fearful 
and non-fearful participants; The participants with more 
self-reported fear had a higher RMS mean compared to 
those  with  less  self-reported  fear  (P-value  =  0.046).  A 
similar  effect  was  manifested  when  the  two  male  and 
female  groups  were  compared  concerning  their  HR 
differences during the quiet stance at height. Females had 
higher  HR  compared  to  males.  Notably,  no  statistical 
difference  was  spotted  between  the  male  and  female 
groups for RMS at height in the absence of MB. However, 
in  the  presence  of  MB  at  height,  the  result  of  T-test 
indicated  that  the  mean  RMS  of  the  females  was 
significantly higher (P value = 0.009) compared to that of 
males.  Another  important  observation  was  the  inability 
of  AQ  values in predicting the differences between the 
two  groups  of  subjects  separated  by  their  levels  of 
acrophobia. 

6  Discussion and Conclusion 

According to the statistical test results, the presence 
of a virtual environment has a substantial influence on the 
postural  sway  of  the  participants.  Except  for  postural 

variability, RMS, almost all the other postural parameters 
increased for the participants who were experiencing VR 
for the first time. Based on similar findings of previous 
studies, the observed increase in the postural sway—due 
to  the  exposure  to  the  immersive  environment—was 
predictable [31]. 

Furthermore,  participants  were  asked  to  ‘normally’ 
look at their feet during the quiet stance in VR with the 
absence of height. Due to the lower field of view of the 
VR  headsets  compared  to  that  of  a  person  without 
wearing  VR  headsets,  participants’  postural  balance 
might have been affected. Streepey et al., pointed out this 
limitation  as  a  lack  of  peripheral  visual  inputs  while 
wearing  glasses [32]. Therefore, although the existence 
of such a factor in the comparison between VR trial cases 
is  unlikely,  its  potential  impact  on  the  presence  of  VR 
cannot  be  rendered  negligible.  As  for  the  impact  of 
elevated  surfaces  on  balance,  the  presence  of  height 
the 
increased  subjects’  postural  sway.  Based  on 
statistically 
the 
significant  mean  differences  of 
participants’ TE, the presence of height factor was able 
to predict the difference in the means with the P value of 
0.05. This finding was also in line with the results of the 
Cleworth  et  al.,  study  [33].  They  suggested  that  the 
virtual  height  reduces  the  mediolateral  and  anterior-
posterior  balance  of  subjects  similar  to  the  real  height. 
Remarkably, the visual stimuli in the form of a moving 
object  increased  participants  heartbeat  dramatically. 
With  a  P  value  of  0.00005  both  with  and  without  the 
presence  of  height,  the  MB  significantly  increased 
participants’ heart rates. These findings suggest that tasks 
involving  handling  of  big  moving  objects,  e.g.,  steel 
erection, will increase the heart rate of first-time workers 
exposed to the great extents. This physiological response 
to  big  approaching  objects  should  be  studied  more 
extensively  since  the  noticeably  low  P-value  magnifies 
its importance in the context of safety. On the other hand, 
since the participants were informed that the approaching 
digital  beam  would  not  ‘hit’  them,  no  statistically 
significant  mean  changes  were  observed  for  their 
postural parameters.

Based on the results of the unpaired T-tests, those fear 
questions  related  to  driving,  height,  and  sharp  objects, 
derived 
fear  questionnaire, 
powerfully  predict  the  differences  in  the  RMS  in  the 
presence of virtual height. Accordingly, it can be inferred 
that fear increases RMS, in the presence of virtual height. 
In  other  words,  standing  on  elevated  surfaces,  people 
with  higher  self-judged  fear  values  have  more  postural 
sway variability compared to those with lower fear values. 
Adkin  et  al.  showed  that  fear  of  height  modifies  the 
postural  sway  [34].  Based  on  the  participants’  anxiety 
rating, they suggested that balance would be affected by 
the  fear  of  height  factor.  Similar  to  our  findings,  they 
concluded  that  both  physiological  variables,  such  as

groups  might 

However, to our surprise, the AQ values were not able 
to address any changes in the postural stability, nor were 
they  able  to  explain  heart  rate  for  different  scenarios 
during quiet stance. One explanation for the incapability 
of  AQ  to  address  mean  differences  between  the 
this 
corresponding 
questionnaire was designed to detect abnormalities rather 
than differences concerning the fear of height. Therefore, 
since most of the participants did not score high on this 
questionnaire, then they latent differences regarding fear 
of height was not noticeable. Following this rationale, a 
threshold-based  categorization  should  be  conducted  on 
the AQ results rather than the AQ mean-based approach. 
Since the threshold should not be less than 2 (Likert-scale 
range for AQ is from 1 to 5), so that it can detect people 
with acrophobia, and most of our subjects’ average AQ 
score was less than 2, we were not able to categorize with 
thresholds. 

With  respect  to  subjects’  gender,  at  height,  female 
subjects perceived a higher level of anxiety, in the form 
of HR, compared to male. Also, the average HR of female 
participants were higher compared to that of male, when 
they  were  confronted  by  the  moving  structural  beam. 
Another interesting result was the influence of gender on 
the  RMS.  With  the  P  values  less  than  0.05,  their  RMS 
values  were  significantly  lower  than  male  in  both 
regarding  bodily 
scenarios  with  MB.  Therefore, 
responses  in  the  proximity  of  big  moving  objects, 
seemingly,  women  HR  increases  more  than  men  and 
men’s RMS increases more than women. Considered as 
one  of  the  limitations  of  the  current  study,  prior 
information  regarding  VR  studies  could  influence  the 
postural stability of the participants as their uncertainty 
about  the  experiments  mixes  with  the  expectation  of 
being at height. This unwanted effect potentially explains 
the differences between the postural stability of male and 
female  groups  in  VR  with  the  absence  of  any  visual 
perturbations.
