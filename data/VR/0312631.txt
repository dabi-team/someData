Abstract. Photometry of the Q2237+0305gravitational lens in VRI spectral bands with the 1.5-m telescope of
the high-altitude Maidanak observatory in 1995-2000 is pre- sented. Monitoring of Q2237+0305 in July-October
2000, made at nearly daily basis, did not reveal rapid (night-to-night and intranight) variations of brightness of
the components during this time period. Rather slow changes of magnitudes of the components were observed,
such as 0.08m fading of B and C components and 0.05m brightening of D in R band during July 23 - October
7, 2000. By good luck three nights of observation in 1999 were almost at the time of the strong brightness peak
of image C, and approximately in the middle of the ascending slope of the image A brightness peak. The C
component was the most blue one in the system in 1998 and 1999, having changed its (V-I) color from 0.56m to
0.12m since August 1997, while its brightness increased almost 1.2m during this time period. The A component
behaved similarly between August 1998 and August 2000, having become 0.47m brighter in R, and at the same
time, 0.15m bluer. A correlation between the color variations and variations of magnitudes of the components
is demonstrated to be signiﬁcant and reaches 0.75, with a regression line slope of 0.33. A color (V-I) vrs color
(V-R) plot shows the components settled in a cluster, stretched along a line with a slope of 1.31. Both slopes
are noticeably smaller than those expected if a standard galactic interstellar reddening law were responsible for
the diﬀerences between the colors of images and their variations over time. We attribute the brightness and color
changes to microlensing of the quasar’s structure, which we conclude is more compact at shorter wavelengths, as
predicted by most quasar models featuring an energizing central source.

1. Introduction

The Q2237+0305 gravitational lens (the Einstein Cross) is
one of the most impressive manifestations of the gravita-
tional lensing phenomenon - four images of the same high-
redshift quasar (z = 1.695) are arranged almost symmetri-
cally around the lensing galaxy nucleus (z = 0.039) within
a circle of approximately 2′′ diameter. The Q2237+0305
system is an excellent target to study microlensing events,

because the light beams, corresponding to the 4 lensed
quasar’s images, pass through the interior, heavily pop-
ulated part of the lensing galaxy and thus, have a high
probability to intersect a signiﬁcant mass of microlens-
ing stars as they pass through the inner disc (Kayser &
Refsdal 1989).

The system has been intensively examined since 1987,
when the ﬁrst published measurements of magnitudes of
the individual lensed quasar components in g, r and i
Gunn ﬁlters were made by Yee (1988). The ﬁrst attempt to

build the light curves of the four quasar components was
made in 1991 by Corrigan et al. (1991). They brought to-
gether all the available Q2237 images of suﬃcient quality,
taken with diﬀerent telescopes and in a variety of pass-
bands, - Mould B, V and R and Gunn g, r and i, - and
reprocessed with a single algorithm. Having used the mul-
ticolor photometry data for 33 normal stars, whose (B−V )
colors ranged from -0.3 to 1.5, they calculated the relevant
color equations, which allowed them to reduce all the ob-
servations to a single passband. Their r Gunn and B light
curves cover the time period from September 1986 up to
December 1989, and include the ﬁrst microlensing event
observed in August 1988 by Irwin et al. (1989).

A further attempt to use all the available observational
data for Q2237+0305 was made in 1994 by construct-
ing ”diﬀerential” light curves, which were argued to be
free from the eﬀects of diﬀerent spectral bands, technique
of zero-pointing, and the quasar intrinsic brightness vari-
ations, (Houde et al. 1994). In addition to the data of
1986-89, contained in (Corrigan et al. 1991), other results
were used, taken in 1990 and 1991 by Crane et al. (1991),
Racine (1992), Rix et al. (1992), and Houde et al. (1994).
The ﬁrst program of regular photometric monitoring
of Q2237+0305 was started in 1990 at the Nordic Optical
Telescope, (Østensen et al. 1996). A large number of mea-
surements of the four quasar components in V, R and I
spectral bands during ﬁve years were obtained, which per-
mitted construction, with the use of Corrigan et al. (1991)
zero-pointing, of the historic light curves, covering 9 years
of observations.

No regular multi-ﬁlter monitoring of Q2237+0305 is
reported between 1996 and 1999, excepting our results
of V RI photometry for three nights on 17-19 September
1995, (Vakulik et al. 1997), and the similar results by
Burud et al. (1998), obtained with the Nordic Optical
Telescope for a close epoch, 10-11 October 1995. No night-
to-night or intranight brightness variations of the four
components have been found for these time periods, while
a noticeable change in the component B color as compared
to the observations by Yee in 1987 (1988) has been re-
ported in both works. A short time-scale monitoring with
the CFHT in June 14-16, 1992 should be mentioned here,
(Cumming & De Robertis, 1995), which also did not re-
veal any photometric variations in R and I bands during
a three-day period.

In 1999 and 2000, the results of V RI photometry in
1997 and 1998 with the Maidanak 1.5-m telescope were
published, (Bliokh et al. 1999) and (Dudinov et al. 2000a).
Recently, the superb results of a detailed long-term moni-
toring, obtained within the OGLE program from 4 August
1997 to 5 November 2000 has become publicly accessi-
ble, and partly presented in two papers of Wozniak et al.
(2000a) and (2000b). And in 2002, the results of moni-
toring of Q2237+0305 by GLITP collaboration appeared,
which cover the 4-month period October 1999 - February
2000 (Alcalde et al. 2002). The most recent publication of
the results of low-resolution observations with the 3.5-m
telescope at the Apache Point Observatory should be also

mentioned here, (Schmidt et al. 2002), which have given
the Gunn r lightcurves of A and B components for 73
dates between July 1995 and January 1998. In spite of a
rather low photometric accuracy, - an error bar of 0.1m to
0.2m is reported, - the data are of value ﬁrst of all because
they include the brightness peak of A component in 1996.
As far as we know, no more data about this event have
been ever published, though reported in private commu-
nication, (e.g. R. Østensen).

The brightness records taken in broad-band ﬁlters are
a good starting point for theorists to estimate the size
of the quasar radiating region in the visual (ultraviolet
rest frame) continuum, and to determine the range for
microlens masses responsible for the observed brightness
variations. Both the statistical analysis of long-term mon-
itoring data, and simulation of the isolated microlens-
ing peaks have been applied to calculate these values,
(Nadeau et al. 1991, Lewis & Irwin 1996, Refsdal & Stabell
1993, Webster et al. 1991, Wyithe et al. 2000a, Wyithe
et al, 2000b, Wyithe et al. 2002, Yonehara 2000), having
given the estimates of the quasar dimension, - 1015cm to
1016cm in the optical continuum, and a great variety of mi-
crolens masses ranging from 0.0006M⊙ < M < 0.006M⊙,
(Nadeau et al. 1991), to 0.1M⊙, (Wambsganss 1991), all
indicating however, that microlensing events in the system
are mostly caused by subsolar-mass objects.

These available models confront a problem which prob-
ably indicates a breakdown of the simple assumption that
the luminous quasar is a uniformly bright accretion disc.
The dilemma is that the short time scale of the observed
events like the C image peak in July 1999 and the A bright-
ness peak in November 1999 occur on such short time
scales that small accretion disc diameters are implied; such
small bright accretion discs would have occasional strong
brightness peaks of several magnitudes that are never ob-
served. This probably tells us that a more complex model
where the time scale of the brightness peaks is related to
a quasar structure crossing time, not the crossing time of
the entire quasar luminosity. We expect to apply, in a sub-
sequent report, the Schild and Vakulik (2003) double ring
quasar model that successfully models the long history of
Q0957+561 microlensing observations.

No systematic multicolor photometric measurements
existed until the monitoring program with the NOT was
started in 1990 (Østensen et al. 1996). Meanwhile, a sus-
picion was expressed by Corrigan et al. in 1991, and in
1992 by Rix et al. independently (Corrigan et al. 1991,
Rix et al. 1992), that the color indices of the components
might have changed since the ﬁrst three-color observations
by Yee, (1988). It was a very important statement, since
reducing diﬀerent datasets to a single light curve, (e.g.
Houde et al., 1994), as well as determining the extinction
law in the Q2237+0305 lensing galaxy, (Yee 1988, Nadeau
et al. 1991, Falco et al. 1999), are substantially based on
the assumptions, that ”all four components have identical
intrinsic color indices”, and ”their observed color diﬀer-
ences are due to diﬀerent degrees of interstellar extinc-
tion and reddening by the same extinction law”, (Houde

V.Vakulik et al.: Color eﬀects in Q2237+0305

3

et al. 1994), and ”the magniﬁcation is wavelength inde-
pendent... and time independent”, (Falco et al. 1999). In
particular, Falco et al. (1999) measured the value of RV
for Q2237+0305 to be equal 5.3 and came to a conclusion
about great diﬀerences in the extinction laws for lensing
galaxies from a sample consisting of 23 gravitational lens
systems. However, as it can be seen from Fig. 4 in Falco
et al. (1999), the diﬀerences may be signiﬁcant at wave-
lengths shorter than 550nm, while at larger wavelengths
the diﬀerence between the extinction curves does not ex-
ceed the error bars.

In discussing the results of the ﬁve-year V RI moni-
toring of Q2237+0305, Østensen et al. (1996) did not an-
alyze, however, any color changes in the system, having
noted only ”very nearly equal” colors for the components
A and B, as well as roughly equal colors of C and D, with
the extinction diﬀerence between the pairs of 0.6m in V
band, provided the extinction law follows λ−1, according
to Houde et al. (1994). Meanwhile, Vakulik et al. (1997)
and Burud et al. (1998) reported that the B component
became the most blue one in the system in 1995, as com-
pared to observations by Yee in 1987, (Yee 1988).

The next step in determining colors and color changes
in the Q2237+0305 system was made in V RI observa-
tions with the Maidanak 1.5-m telescope in 1997-1998,
presented in Dudinov et al. 2000a and Dudinov et al.
2000b. Variations of colors were argued to be signiﬁcant,
and a tendency of the components to become bluer as their
brightness increased has been demonstrated with the use
of all available multicolor data. Unfortunately, the remark-
able monitoring by Wozniak et al. 2000a and Wozniak et
al. 2000b has been made only in V band, and thus can not
be used to investigate the color changes, while the most
recent data of the GLITP collaboration have been taken in
V and R ﬁlters for a campaign of 4 months only (Alcalde
et al. 2002).

By this time, a great amount of observations of
Q2237+0305 in spectral ranges other than visual contin-
uum exists, - VLA observations at 20cm and 3.6cm (Falco
et al. 1996), observations in the near and mid-IR (Nadeau
et al. 1991; Agol et al. 2000), and in the quasar emission
lines (Fitte & Adam 1994; Racine 1992; De Robertis & Yee
1988, Lewis et al. 1998, Saust 1994). The observed mag-
nitudes of the components have been found to be almost
unaﬀected by microlensings in these spectral ranges, which
indicates that much larger quasar features radiate in IR
and in the radio, as well as in the emission lines, as com-
pared to the optical continuum. The recent detection of an
arc of C III] emission, connecting A, D and B components
(Mediavilla et al. 1998), should be regarded as a visual
proof of the extended emission line region of the source.
Because of the low sensitivity of a large source bright-
ness to microlensing, the brightness ratios for the compo-
nents, measured in these spectral ranges, were used to test
the validity of a great variety of the existing macrolensing
models, listed by Wyithe et al. (2002).

Observations in UV with the HST (Blanton et al. 1998)
and the recent X-ray imaging of Q2237+0305 with the

Chandra X-ray Observatory (Dai et al. 2003) should be
also mentioned here, which provided, in particular, highly
accurate relative coordinates of the components (Blanton
et al. 1998) and the upper limits for the physical size and
brightness of the Broad-Line Region producing Ly-α emis-
sion, (Dai et al. 2003). Also, the Chandra data permitted
calculation of the time delay between the A and B com-
ponents of 2.7 hours.

2. Observations

Our observations were carried out with the 1.5-m AZT-
22 telescope of the high-altitude Maidanak observatory,
(Central Asia, Republic of Uzbekistan), known for its su-
perb seeing conditions and a large number of cloudless
nights, (Ehgamberdiev et al. 2000). Because of technical
reasons, we had to use three diﬀerent CCD cameras in our
observations, Pictor-416 camera in 1995, Pictor-416 and
TI 800 x 800 cameras in 1997 and 1998, and ST-7 camera
in 1999 and 2000. And because of technical reasons again,
both f/8 and f/16 focal lengths were used in observations.
The LN-cooled TI 800 x 800 camera, with pixel size of
15µ, kindly provided by Prof.D.Turnshek, unfortunately
revealed some peculiarities, caused by the charge trans-
fer ineﬃciency, that is characteristic for the CCD’s of this
generation, (Turnshek et al. 1997). In particular, notice-
able stretching of stellar images in the direction of charge
transfer is observed, as well as a dependence of the PSF
upon coordinates at the chip plane. In addition, sensitivity
irregularities of the chip can not be corrected satisfactorily,
with the output of the ﬂatﬁelding procedure dependent on
the signal level. All these peculiarities reduced the actual
accuracy of photometry, that is seen in Tables 4 and 6.
telescope tracking system
spoiled the intrinsically good seeing of Maidanak site
sometimes and did not permit use of exposures longer
than 3 minutes. To provide suﬃciently high accuracy of
our photometry with such short exposures, we took images
in series, consisting of 10 to 20 frames each. The frames
were averaged before being subjected to photometric pro-
cessing, while a comparison of photometry of individual
frames enabled us to obtain an adequate estimate of the
random error inherent in a particular series.

Unfortunately, a poor

Most of images has been taken in R band, - 31 dates
in 1995-1999, (Table 4), plus 46 dates in 2000, (Table 5)
- which were obtained almost at a daily basis during 2.5
months. There is also photometry in V and I bands for 17
dates in 1995-2000, (Table 6). Some results have been pre-
sented in our previous publications (Vakulik et al. 1997,
Bliokh et al. 1999, Dudinov et al. 2000a, Dudinov et al.
2000b). We present here the results of all our observa-
tions, including those which have been never published.
In particular, the observations of July-October 2000 are
presented, which have been undertaken to search for short-
period (night-to-night) variations of brightness. The ap-
pearance of the Einstein Cross at six epochs between
October 1995 and August 2001 can be seen in Fig. 1,

4

which clearly demonstrates high photometric variability
in the system.

In addition to magnitudes of the components, the see-
ing conditions are also presented in Tables 4 and 5, - the
values of FWHM for particular nights, the scales and the
CCD camera used.

3. Photometric Reductions

inherent

in accurate photometry of
The diﬃculties
ground-based images of Q2237+0305, have been noted by
many authors, (Burud et al. 1998, Corrigan et al. 1991,
Vakulik et al. 1997, Yee 1988). They are due mainly to
its extremely compact spatial structure, with the wings
of the quasar images overlapping even under good seeing
conditions. Additional diﬃculties are due to the presence
of a rather bright foreground lensing galaxy, with its steep
radial brightness distribution. These are the main reasons
for poor agreement of the results of diﬀerent monitoring
programs, and even for a noticeable discrepancy in pho-
tometric results for the same data reduced with diﬀerent
algorithms, (Burud et al. 1998, Alcalde et al. 2002). In
photometry of the data of 1995-1999, we used the method
described in Vakulik et al. 1997, and Bliokh et al. 1999,
which is in general features similar to the double iterative
PSF subtraction method, proposed by Yee (1988), who
was the ﬁrst to present spatially resolved photometry of
the system. In short, the method consists of the following.
The PSF estimate is obtained from a reference star
image, and is further superimposed upon each image com-
ponent and the galaxy nucleus alternately, and then sub-
tracted in such a way, that no depressions would appear
in the residual brightness distribution. Such a procedure
is repeated iteratively until a stable convergence of esti-
mates of brightness and coordinates of the components
is achieved. Then, according to the resulting estimates,
the quasar components are subtracted, and the residual
galaxy brightness distribution is smoothed with a rather
broad median ﬁlter. After the resulting galaxy bright-
ness distribution is subtracted from the initial image, re-
moval of quasar components is repeated, followed again by
smoothing the galaxy brightness distribution with a suc-
cessively decreasing window. The iterative process stops
when the width of the median ﬁlter becomes of order of
the PSF width.

In processing our data for the 2000 observing season,
another method was applied, which used the known rel-
ative coordinates of the components and an analytical
model of the brightness distribution in the galaxy, repre-
sented as a sum of three two-dimensional Gaussian func-
tions. Before describing the algorithm, consider the basic
principles of photometry for compact groups of star-like
objects, that have been implemented in the known algo-
rithms of other authors.

Even in the images of Q2237+0305 taken with the
Hubble Space Telescope, the quasar components are star-
like and thus, in the isoplanacy region, the entire picture
(photometric model of the system) can be represented as

a sum of the PSF’s r(x − xk, y − yk), and the galaxy light
distribution g(x, y), and in the case of a sampled CCD
image, may be written as:

4

f (i, j) =

Ikr(i − xk, j − yk) + g(i, j),

(1)

k=1
X

where i and j are pixel numbers in x and y axes, chosen
in parallel to the CCD lines and columns, respectively.
The unknown parameters, - the coordinates of the compo-
nents in the detector reference frame, xk, yk, their relative
brightnesses Ik, and the galaxy light distribution g(i, j), -
are usually estimated from a requirement to minimize the
diﬀerence between a model and the observed brightness
distribution in the detected image according to some cri-
terion, - e.g. the minimum of the sum of square residuals
criterion:

Φ(p) =

(F (i, j) − f (i, j, p))2 = min.

(2)

i
X

j
X

Here F (i, j) is the brightness distribution in the detected
image, and the set of unknown parameters is denoted as p
for short. The estimate of the PSF can be obtained from
the images of reference stars near the object.

As was noted above, noticeable diﬃculties in photom-
etry of Q2237+0305 components are caused by the fore-
ground lensing galaxy, with its light distribution g(x, y)
being unknown. In minimizing Eq. 2, or another one sim-
ilar to it, - the galaxy brightness distribution is usually
represented either analytically, - (e.g. Burud et al. 1998,
Alcalde et al. 2002), or its digital form g(i, j) is estimated,
- e.g. the MCS algorithm (Magain et al. 1998, Burud et
al. 1998).

To solve the problem, iterative algorithms are often
used, which in fact approximately realize minimization of
Eq. 2, and also permit to obtain the estimate of g(x, y) ei-
ther analytically (Teuber 1993, Ostensen et al. 1996) or in
a digital form, (Yee 1988, Vakulik et al. 1997). The result-
ing analytic or numerical model can be treated further
in photometry of Q2237+0305 components as a known
function. Such an approach noticeably simpliﬁes the solu-
tion procedure, and provides good intrinsic convergence,
(Corrigan et al. 1991, Alcalde et al. 2002, Burud et al.
1998), but unfortunately, does not ensure the absence of
systematic errors in estimating the magnitudes of the com-
ponents caused by an inadequate galaxy model.

A new image subtraction method proposed by Alard
& Lupton (1999) and successfully applied by Wozniak
et al. (2000a, 2000b) and by Alcalde et al. (2002) in
Q2237+0305 photometry, is seemingly free from this weak
point. However, a comparison of photometry results for
Q2237+0305 published by the OGLE group and those ob-
tained with other methods, reveals some systematics in
the components magnitudes, that is probably caused by a
bias of brightness estimates in their reference image.

The PSF is usually represented either numerically, or
as an analytic function. In this work, the following ap-
proach was used. We transformed all the detected images

V.Vakulik et al.: Color eﬀects in Q2237+0305

to the same axisymmetrical Gaussian PSF with a pre-
assigned parameter σs using the inverse linear ﬁltration
procedure:

F (i, j) = ˜W

˜F0(ωl, ωn) · R(ωl, ωn)
˜r(ωl, ωn)

,

!

(3)

Here ˜F0(ωl, ωn) is the Fourier transform of the initial im-
age, F (i, j) is the transformed (standardized) image, and
˜W is the inverse Fourier transform operator. A complex-
valued inverse ﬁlter w(ωl, ωn) = 1/˜r(ωl, ωn) is composed
from the Fourier transform of the initial PSF r(i, j). A
function R(ωl, ωn) = exp[−σ2
n)/2] forms the
Fourier spectrum of the standardized image with the
Gaussian PSF for the given parameter σs. To construct the
inverse ﬁlter, a reference star about 64′′south-west from
the quasar, denoted as α star in Corrigan et al. (1991)
was used.

l + ω2

s (ω2

In doing so, we did not try to noticeably increase the
resolution in the initial images, and used a transforma-
tion (3) that is a linear one, and, in contrast to non-linear
ﬁltration methods, retains photometric accuracy. To ex-
clude dependence of the resulting PSF on the signal-to-
noise ratio in the Fourier spectrum of a speciﬁc image, we
also did not use any optimizing algorithms of image re-
construction, such as e.g. the well-known Wiener ﬁltering.
Since the restoring ﬁlter is normalized to unity at the
zero spatial frequency, such a transformation retains the
integral brightness of an image, and thus the estimates of
the components’ brightnesses can be made in the units of
the reference star brightness.

With such standardized images created, the sum in

Eq.1 can be represented as

s(i, j) =

4

k=1
X

Ik exp{−[(i − xk)2 + (j − yk)2]/2σ2

s },

(4)

where σs is an eﬀective width of the resulting PSF.

The distribution of light over the galaxy was repre-
sented by a sum of three two-dimensional Gaussian func-
tions:

g(i, j) =

3

=

Im exp{−[(i − xg) cos ϕm + (j − yg) sin ϕm]2/2η2

m−

m=1
X

− [−(i − xg) sin ϕm + (j − yg) cos ϕm]2/2ε2

m},

(5)

where xg, yg are coordinates of the galaxy center, Im are
normalizing coeﬃcients, ηm and εm are parameters deter-
mining the characteristic widths of the Gaussian proﬁles
along the major and minor axes respectively, with their
meaning understood from Eq. 5, and ﬁnally, ϕm deﬁnes
the major axes orientation. Therefore, the photometric
model of the system f (i, j, p) in Eq.2 can be represented
as a sum of two constituents, s(i, j) and g(i, j), which de-

sists of four pairs of coordinates xk, yk and coordinates of
the galaxy center xg, yg, normalizing multipliers Ik, Im,
the parameters ηm, εm, and orientations of axes ϕm of the
three Gaussian components of the galaxy model.

To calculate the parameters of the galaxy photometric
model, as well as the coordinates of the quasar compo-
nents, a set consisting of 14 best quality images was se-
lected that was obtained on September 2, 2000 in R ﬁlter
under the atmospheric seeing of 0.′′8 and better. The im-
ages were averaged and reduced, through the inverse linear
ﬁltration procedure described above, to the Gaussian PSF
with σs = 0.′′34, (FWHM of 0.′′8).

The least-squares algorithm was used to calculate the
brightnesses and coordinates of the components and the
parameters of the galaxy photometric model from the con-
dition expressed by Eq. 2. It should be noted, that in such
a way we obtain parameters of the galaxy model, that is
the result of the convolution of an actual galaxy light dis-
tribution with the Gaussian PSF with the given σs = 0.′′34.
Since Gaussian functions were adopted both for the PSF
and for the constituents of the galaxy model, the decon-
volved galaxy model parameters can be easily calculated.
Such deconvolved parameters are presented in Table 1.

In Table 2, the relative positions of the B, C, D compo-
nents and the galaxy center in the equatorial coordinate
system, calculated from the 14 selected images with the
procedure described above are presented. Our coordinates
agree within 0.′′015 with those obtained from the HST im-
ages (Crane et al. 1991, Blanton et al. 1998).

In the subsequent photometric processing of all the
available data, every image was reduced to a ”standard”
PSF, and the corresponding quasar image brightnesses
were estimated by minimizing the function (2), with the

 
6

V.Vakulik et al.: Color eﬀects in Q2237+0305

parameters of the galaxy model and the relative coordi-
nates of the components being ﬁxed, according to Tables
1 and 2. The α star from Corrigan et al.(1991) was used
as a secondary photometric standard, with its magnitudes
taken from this work.

Photometry of the image sets taken during a single
night does not show brightness variations that might be
regarded as signiﬁcant as compared to the photometry
uncertainties. Therefore, the brightness estimates taken
within a night were averaged, and the formally calculated
error in the mean can be regarded as a measure of the
inner convergence of our photometry. The method ensures
photometry with no seeing-dependent systematic errors,
inherent in some other methods, - for images with a PSF
up to 1.′′4.

4. Results of V RI photometry

Our photometry is presented in Tables 4,
5, and 6.
The magnitudes were zero-pointed with Yee’s (1988) ref-
erence star, with its magnitudes taken from Corrigan et
al. (1991). Our measurements in R band in 1997-2000 are
plotted in Fig. 2, where the OGLE data (Wozniak et al
2000b) taken in V ﬁlter are shown in grey. For better com-
parison, our data of Tables 4 and 5 are shifted by small
amounts along the vertical axis, - 0.1, 0.13, 0.15 and 0.3
magnitudes for A, B,C and D, respectively.

The most important brightness changes observed were:

1. An increase of the image A brightness, starting at the
end of 1998 and peaking, according to photometry of
Wozniak et al.(2000b) and Alcalde et al. (2002), in the
middle of November 1999. We observed almost 0.4m
brightening of A image between our observing seasons
in 1998 and 1999.

2. A monotonic decline of almost 1.0m in image B bright-
ness starting with our earliest, 1995.8 observation. It
has become the faintest component in R band by
September 2000.

3. A strong brightness peak in image C. Our observations
in July 19-22, 1999 were made near the brightness peak
of the C component, seen in the well-sampled light
curves of Wozniak et al. (2000b). The C image became
almost 1m brighter in R band between August 1997
and July 1999. Thus we have an excellent occasion to
detect the color change that accompanied the bright-
ness peak.

4. A noticeable growth of the D image brightness, which
is no more the faintest one since September 2000.

Our measurements, presented in Fig. 2 are in a good
qualitative agreement with more detailed and accurate
single-ﬁlter light curves of Wozniak et al. 2000b, taken
in V band for a similar epoch. A large scatter of points
for 1997 and 1998 in Fig. 2 are due to the dates, when the
TI 800 x 800 CCD camera was used. We compared our V
magnitudes, taken with the TI 800 x 800 camera in 1997-
98, (Table 6) with the same dates of OGLE monitoring,

and found that the OGLE V magnitudes are systemat-
ically smaller than our measurements with this camera.
The greatest diﬀerences are for the A and D components,
reaching approximately 0.2m, with 0.1m for B and C. As
seen from comparison of Table 4 with Table 5, where the
photometry with the ST-7 camera is presented, the latter
is almost an order of magnitude more accurate as com-
pared to the TI 800 x 800 data.

Our well-sampled and most accurate measurements,
made in July-September 2000 with the ST-7 camera, - the
datapoints near the right edge of Fig. ??, - can be seen in
Fig. 3 more in detail, (see also Table 5). For better clar-
ity, the light curves in Fig. 3 were arbitrarily shifted along
the magnitude axis, and ﬁt with quadratic polynomials,
with the 1% error strips shown. Variations of brightness
of all the components were moderate during this time pe-
riod, about 0.02m ÷ 0.03m per month, and may be ap-
proximated by the second-order polynomials quite well.
The brightness estimates for the A component are mainly
within a 1% deviation with respect to the ﬁtted curve. A
correlation between the rapid brightness variations of all
the components seen in Fig. 3 could be ascribed to quasar
intrinsic brightness changes, except that since their am-
plitudes are larger for the fainter components, these vari-
ations are probably not real and are more likely due to
errors.

We compared our photometry of July-September 2000
in V band with the OGLE data, obtained for the same
dates, and, since our data do not overlap with the obser-
vations of GLITP collaboration, we made a similar com-
parison between their photometry and that of OGLE. The
results of such a comparison are presented in Table 3.
Here, positive diﬀerences mean that OGLE magnitudes
are smaller. The diﬀerence between our photometry and
that of OGLE program will be even smaller for A, B and
C images if one takes into account 0.034m diﬀerence in
magnitude for α star adopted in Wozniak et al. (2000a)
and in this work, though systematics for the C component
will become larger.

5. Variations of color in Q2237+0305

The ﬁrst multicolor observations by Yee (1988) have im-
mediately shown, that the components diﬀer in their col-
ors. An obvious dependence of the components’ reddening
on the distance to the galaxy nucleus allowed Yee to ex-
plain it by selective extinction in the dusty matter of the

V.Vakulik et al.: Color eﬀects in Q2237+0305

7

lensing galaxy. This suggestion made it possible to esti-
mate the extinction law in the lensing galaxy, which, ac-
cording to Nadeau et al. (1991) and Yee (1988), is similar
to that in our Galaxy. It should be emphasized here, that
the conclusion was based on the analysis of color diﬀer-
ences of the components for a ﬁxed epoch.

As mentioned in the Introduction, a suspicion arose in
1991 and 1992, that the colors of the components might
have changed, (Corrigan et al. 1991; Rix et al. 1992). In
particular, Corrigan et al. did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant vari-
ations of (B − r) colors of the components with time,
but they were the ﬁrst to notice that ”there may be a
small color change in image A as the r magnitude gets
fainter” (Corrigan et al. 1991). They referred to the work
by Wambsganss & Paczinski (1991), where the possibility
is discussed that, if the quasar structure is wavelength de-
pendent, microlensing events will diﬀerently reveal them-
selves in diﬀerent spectral regions. In particular, according
to Wambsganss & Paczinski (1991), the bluer inner parts
of the continuum source might be more strongly ampliﬁed
as compared to the outer parts.

Rix et al. (1992), analyzing their observations in U
and R bands with the Hubble Space Telescope, plotted
their (U − R) colors against (g − i) colors of the compo-
nents, measured by Yee (1988), and concluded that they
”are only marginally consistent” with the reddening line
derived by Nadeau et al. (1991). They suggested, the dis-
crepancy could be due to either variable dust extinction
in the lensing galaxy, or to the eﬀects of microlensing
color changes, ﬁrst noted by Kayser et al. (1989) and
later investigated by Wambsganss & Paczynski (1991) and
Wambsganss (1991) in simulations.

We have already analyzed the behavior of the rela-
tive colors of the Q2237+0305 components qualitatively,
(Dudinov et al. 2000a and Dudinov et al. 2000b), based
upon our observations on Maidanak in 1995 (Vakulik et
al. 1997), and in 1997-1998, and also upon all available
multicolor observations by other authors, (Burud et al.
1998; Østensen et al. 1996; Rix et al. 1992; Yee 1988).
A tendency for the components to become more blue as
their brightness increases has been noted there, but no
quantitative relationships have been derived.

We present here our measurements of the colors of the
A,B,C,D components, and the attempt to quantitatively
analyze the behavior of (V −R) and (V −I) color indices of
the components using our data taken in 1995-2000. V RI
photometry is presented in Table 6, and (V − R) and (V −
I) colors can be seen in Table 7. Formal errors for these
quantities, calculated as the errors of the average, range
from 0.02m − 0.03m (A component) to 0.03m − 0.05m (D
component),
for the most accurate observations of 2000,
and, as seen from Table 6, are within 0.08m − 0.15m for
the observations of 1997-1998, made with the TI 800 x 800
camera.

As shown in the previous section, our photometry is
in quite satisfactory agreement with that obtained by
other observers for close epochs, (e.g. Alcalde et al. 2002,
Woznyak et al. 2000b). At any rate, the discrepancy does

not exceed that obtained when diﬀerent algorithms are
applied to the same data, (Alcalde et al. 2002, Burud et
al. 1998).

However, one should keep in mind the peculiarities of
Q2237+0305 photometry mentioned above in analyzing
and interpreting the lightcurves in general, and especially
those combined from heterogeneous observing data. With
this in view, more weight should be given to the analysis of
relative quantities, which are less sensitive to diﬀerences
in observational circumstances and algorithms of image
processing. In particular, relative colors and relative mag-
nitudes, as well as their variations are such quantities.
Examining their behavior in time, and their relationships
with each other in microlensings can be a valuable source
of additional information about the physical properties of
both the quasar and lensing galaxy. In particular, they can
be used to probe the spatial structure of the quasar at dif-
ferent wavelengths, (Wambsganss & Paczynski 1991), and
to determine the extinction law in the lensing galaxy.

A correlation between (V − I) colors of the compo-
nents and their R magnitudes can be seen from Fig. 4,
where the components are marked with diﬀerent symbols.
It is interesting to note, that B, C and D components
are arranged just along a line in this diagram, while the
A component forms a separate cluster of points. We can
not refute the possibility of some systematic errors in our
photometry, but we argue that they would hardly arrange
the B, C and D components along a single line so well,
- a correlation reaches 0.8 for them, - and separate the
A component so signiﬁcantly. Moreover, we studied the
systematic errors of our algorithms very carefully in sim-
ulation and found, that their eﬀect, if present, might only
slightly bias the color of the C and D components to larger
values, i.e. make them redder, as compared to A and B,
(see Vakulik et al. 1997 for more details). We see from Fig.
4, however, that the cluster of point for A image is shifted
towards redder colors with respect to the cluster for B, C
and D.

If all the components were equally macroampliﬁed, and
if both the colour diﬀerences of the components and their
variations in time were caused by the interstellar redden-
ing law, similar to that for our Galaxy, a linear relationship
between (V − I) and R could be expected, with a regres-
sion slope of about 0.42 for (V − I) base, (Schild 1977).
Microlensing events, with their still unknown brightness-
color dependence, would disturb and rearrange this order,
making the components follow the reddening line in the
average, but forming individual clusters of points, with
the patterns and stretches, determined by the level of mi-
crolensing activity at a particular time period, and by the
unknown character of color-brightness dependence of mi-
crolensings.

However, the existing macrolens models predict diﬀer-
ent macroampliﬁcations for the components. According to
the macromodel by Schmidt et al. (1998), rather well con-
ﬁrmed by the observations in emission lines (Fitte & Adam
1994; Racine 1992; Lewis et al. 1998, Saust 1994), and in
the IR spectral range, (Nadeau, et al. 1991; Agol, et al.

8

V.Vakulik et al.: Color eﬀects in Q2237+0305

2000), where no microlensing eﬀects are expected, the A,
B and D components must be almost equally macroampli-
ﬁed, with the ﬂux ratios of 0.25, 0.27 and 0.32 respectively.
The C component is expected to have the least macroam-
pliﬁcation factor by this model, - ﬂux ratio of 0.15 is pre-
dicted for it. It means, that in this case the components
can not be expected to sit along a line in the (V − I) vrs
R plot. In the presence of microlensings, the components
would produce a family of clusters, shifted with respect to
each other by the amount of ﬂux ratio diﬀerences.

We see in Fig. 4 another situation however. While B, C
and D components produce three overlapping clusters, all
of them being stretched approximately in the same direc-
tion, the A datapoints form a separate cluster, stretched
along a line with a slope similar to that of the joint B, C
and D cluster. All the points in the joint cluster are rather
well correlated, with a correlation index of 0.8 ± 0.1 and
a regression line slope of 0.33 ± 0.08. The points formed
by the A component are also rather well correlated, with
a correlation index of 0.84 and a regression line slope of
0.36.

To eliminate possible additive constituents of the color-
magnitude dependence, which may diﬀer for diﬀerent com-
ponents, and to focus on the analysis of changes, we stud-
ied a correlation between the deviations of (V − I) colors
from their average over the whole time period, and sim-
ilarly calculated variations of brightness in R band. The
diagram can be seen in Fig. 5. The quantities are rather
well correlated, with a correlation index of 0.75 ± 0.08,
and a regression slope of 0.31 ± 0.08, in a good agreement
with that of Fig. 4 for B, C and D components, but the A
component is not situated separately this time. The un-
certainties are given for an 80% conﬁdence interval.

A diagram of color (V − I) - color (V − R), which is
known to be of great diagnostic importance for the study
of dust extinction, is usually presented by all authors of
multicolor observations, e.g., Yee (1988), Rix et al. (1992),
Burud et al. (1998), but, as was noted above, only for a
ﬁxed epoch. In such a diagram, the color indices should
be proportional to each other for any color base and for
any type of dust extinction, with the slope determined
by the reddening law. The diagram, built with the use
of our measurements (see Table 6), can be seen in Fig.
6. A large range of color variations of the C component
should be particularly noted. It is quite real and can be
explained by the presence of observations of 1999 in our
data, - two asterisks near the origin. As was noted, these
data were obtained near the July 1999 brightness peak of
C, when it became almost 1m brighter during two years,
(Wozniak et al. 2000b), and exceeded the B component in
brightness. The datapoints in this diagram are found along
a line with a slope of approximately 1.31 ± 0.14, which is
much less than 2.15 for these color indices expected for
the interstellar reddening law in our Galaxy, (Schild 1977).
We conclude that if the extinction law in the lens galaxy is
similar to that of our Galaxy, the observed color changes
can not be explained by variable interstellar reddening.

6. Color Changes Associated with Brightness

Peaks

A further perspective of the nature of the observed color
changes comes from a comparison of the history of bright-
ness changes with the history of color changes. The general
features of long-term variations of the components mag-
nitudes during 1995-2000 in comparison with the simul-
taneously determined colors can be seen in Fig. 7. Since
durations of our observing seasons are small as compared
to the characteristic time scale of the long-term variations
of colors of the components, we calculated the mean val-
ues for (V − I) and R for every season, and plotted them
as a function of time, (the midpoint dates of each season
are used here).

Long-term variations of colors of the components are
clearly seen in this ﬁgure, as well as a tendency of the
components to change their color indices towards smaller
values (bluer color) as their brightness increases. But the
tendency is not always straightforward. Some reddening
of the components, preceding the subsequent decrease of
their color indices at the stage of component brighten-
ing can be also seen. As noted above, our observations in
July 1999 were made very close to the brightness peak of
C component, that is seen very well from the more com-
plete and well sampled light curves of the OGLE program,
Wozniak et al. (2000b), while the A component was just
in the middle of the ascending slope of its peak at this
time, according to the observations of OGLE and GLITP
programs, (Wozniak et al. 2000b, Alcalde et al. 2002).

The relationship between brightness change and color
is obvious and approximately as expected from models of
Wambsganss & Paczynski (1991). The most direct corre-
lation is found for image C, where (V − I) color is almost
perfectly anti-correlated with brightness. Thus as the C
quasar image brightened by almost 1.0m in R between
1997.5 and 1999.6, it became bluer by 0.42 magnitudes in
(V − I) color index (Fig. 7). A second interesting behavior
is seen in the brightness of image A, where we ﬁnd that the
brightness increased by 0.45m as the color became bluer by
0.15m in the (V − I) color index. Just as interesting is the
color history for image B, which underwent a sustained
slow brightness drop of 1.0m during our monitoring pe-
riod. As it gently declined in brightness, it became 0.25m
redder in (V − I) color from 1995.7 to 1998.8, and then
again became 10% (0.1m) bluer as the brightness contin-
ued to fade from 1998.8 to 2000.9.

We have already shown that this is not likely to be pro-
duced by a hole appearing in some absorbing clouds. If in-
stead we view the image C brightness peak as a microlens-
ing artefact where a compact object (star) in the lens
galaxy passed in front of the quasar and caused the tem-
porary brightening, we can compare to the calculations
in Figs 1, 2, and 3 of Wambsganss & Paczinski (1991).
Their models were crafted to apply to Q2237, and they
show approximately the correct brightness change (1m in-
crease in V ) and color change (0.4m bluer in (B − R))
for events with 1 year duration, and appear similar to

V.Vakulik et al.: Color eﬀects in Q2237+0305

9

the Wambsganss & Paczinski (1991) Fig. 2 i,j pattern of
a quasar image passing outside a cusp of a microlensing
star. We do not press these calculations further because
we feel that the failed Wyithe, Turner, and Webster (2000)
prediction of a subsequent large brightness change inval-
idates all models with such simple accretion disc approx-
imations. However almost any quasar model with an en-
ergizing central source produces quasar structure which
is more compact at shorter wavelengths. We expect to
produce separately a series of models that can reproduce
the observed eﬀects, based upon the double-ring Schild &
Vakulik (2003) model.

Although quasar emission lines contaminate the color
photometry in the continuum-dominated ﬁlter bands, we
doubt that the emission lines are responsible for the large
brightness-color eﬀects found here, given that the large
brightness changes observed are always associated with
microlensing of the quasar continuum.

7. Conclusions

1. Our observations demonstrate drastic changes of the
component magnitudes, which are inherently uncor-
related in this system, conﬁrming high probability
for microlensings, predicted for Q2237+0305 in 1989,
(Kayser & Refsdal 1989). The highest gradient of
brightness change was observed for the C component
between 1997 and 1998, - almost 0.07m per month in
our R ﬁlter. Almost the same value has been measured
by OGLE program in their V band for the same time
period. However, a much more rapid brightness change
of the C component was detected immediately after
its extraordinary brightness peak in July 1999 by the
OGLE program, - almost a 0.2m decrease per month
in their V band, (Wozniak et al. 2000b).

2. No strong microlensing event occurred in the system
during our detailed 2.5-months monitoring in July-
October 2000 but the fact that the B component
has become the faintest one, after its long continu-
ous fading beginning in 1995, (see Fig. 2 and Table 5).
No noticeable night-to-night brightness variations were
detected in this time period. Moderate brightness
changes were inherent in all the components, reaching
a 0.03m decrease per month for B and C, and 0.02m
brightening for D, (see Fig. 3 and Table 5).

3. All the components demonstrated variations of their
colors during 1995-2000, which we argue to be real and
signiﬁcant. The most prominent change of color was
observed for the C component, - 0.43m for its (V − I)
color index during two years. The (V − I) color indices
of A, B and D were less variable during the whole
time period, having changed from 0.3m to 0.5m for A,
from 0.2m to 0.5m for B, and from 0.7m to 0.45m for
D component, which became 0.2m bluer between 1997
and 2000, having approached the B component in color
and exceeded it in brightness.

4. The (V − I), (V − R) color-color plot shown in Fig. ??
incorporates all our observations. The regression slope

is 1.31 ± 0.14 for this diagram, i.e. much smaller than
a value of 2.16, expected for the reddening line in our
Galaxy for these color indices. We conclude that the
brightness and color changes observed are not caused
by time variations in reddening, but are more probably
caused by microlensing of source structure that is more
compact at shorter wavelengths.

5. The large brightness peak of the C component in July
1999 was accompanied by large color change in the
sense that as the C image brightness increased by al-
most 1m both in our R and Wozniak et al. (2000b) V
bands, the color became bluer by 0.43m in (V −I). This
is the sense and amplitude expected for microlensing
of an object that is smaller at shorter wavelengths, and
modelled previously by Wambsganss and Paczinski
(1991). The colors of the other components behave
similarly, though the amplitudes of their color vari-
ations are smaller, (see Fig. 7).

6. Returning to Fig. 4, where the relationship between
the (V −I) colors and R magnitudes of the components
is shown, we note that the plot is inconsistent with the
adopted models of macrolensing, e.g. Schmidt et al.
(1998). We think that most probably the A component
is macroampliﬁed almost 0.8m more than B, C and D,
which have almost equal ampliﬁcations.

We hope, that the data presented here will demon-
strate the importance of multiband observations of grav-
itationally lensed quasars in general, and Q2237+0305 in
particular. More detailed analysis of the obtained data
and simulation with the new quasar structure model, will
be presented in the next paper, which is in progress.

Fig. 1. Images of Q2237+0305 for six epochs, obtained in
R band with the 1.5-m Maidanak telescope; A component
is at the bottom, C is at the left.

Fig. 2. Photometry of Q2237+0305 A,B,C,D in R band
from observations with the 1.5-m Maidanak telescope in
1997-2000, (large symbols). Photometry in V band by
OGLE program is also plotted by smaller and fainter sym-
bols. Our data (Tables 4 and 5) are shifted arbitrarily for
better comparison, see Sec. 4 for more details. The appar-
ent brightness discrepancy near the image C 1999 bright-
ness peak results from the diﬀerent monitoring ﬁlter bands
used and a signiﬁcant color change during the brightness
peak event.

Fig.3. Photometry of Q2237+0305 A,B,C,D in R band
from observations with the 1.5-m Maidanak telescope in
2000, July 23 - September 7. The light curves of the com-
ponents are shifted arbitrarily along the magnitude axis
with respect to each other for clarity, and approximated
by second-order polynomials.

Fig. 4. (V − I) colors vrs R magnitudes, calculated for ob-
servations of 1995-2000. Note a separate cluster of points
for A component. A regression line slope for B, C and D
components is of 0.33 ± 0.08.

Fig. 5. Variations of (V −I) colors (vertical axis) vrs varia-
tions of R magnitudes, calculated for observations of 1995-
2000. A regression line slope is 0.31 ± 0.08.

Fig. 6. Color (V − I) vrs color (V − R) diagram
for Q2237+0305 A,B,C,D components, plotted from the
Maidanak data, taken in 1995-2000. A regression line slope
is 1.31 ± 0.14.

Fig. 7. Long-term variations of R magnitudes (upper
panel) and (V − I) colors (at the bottom) of A, B, C,
D components of Q2237+0305 from the observations of
1995-2000. Each point is a result of averaging within one
observational set.
