Abstract. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a valuable di-
agnostic and monitoring imaging modality. Proper image acquisition is
essential for diagnosis, yet current assessment techniques are solely based
on manual expert review. This paper presents a supervised deep learn-
ing framework for automatically evaluating and grading the quality of
TEE images. To obtain the necessary dataset, 38 participants of var-
ied experience performed TEE exams with a high-ﬁdelity virtual reality
(VR) platform. Two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures,
AlexNet and VGG, structured to perform regression, were ﬁnetuned and
validated on manually graded images from three evaluators. Two diﬀer-
ent scoring strategies, a criteria-based percentage and an overall general
impression, were used. The developed CNN models estimate the average
score with a root mean square accuracy ranging between 84%-93%, in-
dicating the ability to replicate expert valuation. Proposed strategies for
automated TEE assessment can have a signiﬁcant impact on the training
process of new TEE operators, providing direct feedback and facilitating
the development of the necessary dexterous skills.

Introduction

Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the standard for anaesthesia man-
agement and outcome evaluation in cardiovascular interventions. It is also used
extensively for monitoring critically ill patients in intensive care. The success of
the procedure is chieﬂy dependent on the acquisition of appropriate US views
that allow for a thorough hemodynamic evaluation to be conducted. To capture
high-quality TEE images, practitioners must possess reﬁned psychomotor abil-
ities and advanced hand-eye coordination. Both require rigorous training and
practice.

To facilitate the education of new interventionalists, standardize reporting
and quality, accreditation organisations have deﬁned a set of practice guidelines,
for performing a comprehensive TEE exam [5, 6]. Nevertheless, training is hin-
dered because performance evaluation is, almost exclusively, carried out through
expert supervision. Typically, senior medical personnel grade TEE exams and
review logbooks, a laborious process that requires signiﬁcant amount of time. As
a result, trainees rarely receive immediate feedback. Performance evaluation is
a key element in interventional medicine and alternative, preferably automated,
methods for evaluating TEE competency are necessary [14]. So far, objective
assessment in TEE is focused exclusively on the kinematic analysis of the US
probe with various motion parameters found to be indicative of the level of oper-
ational expertise [9,10]. Although these are important ﬁndings, probe kinematic
information is not available in clinical settings and only captured in simulation
systems. Recent studies emphasise the beneﬁts of virtual reality (VR) simula-
tors that oﬀer a risk-free environment where trainees can practice repeatedly
at the their own convenience [2]. Evidence of performance improvement after
training on VR systems, as well as skill retention and transferability have been
reported [1, 3, 4, 11, 13]. Incorporating performance evaluation and structured
feedback, will allow further use of VR platforms for training and assessment.

In this work, we introduce the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
for the automated evaluation of acquired TEE images. CNNs have found many
applications in medical imaging and computer-assisted surgery [8], but this is
the ﬁrst time they are applied to skills assessment. We aim to generate high-
level features in order to develop a system capable of assigning TEE performance
scores, essentially replicating expert evaluation. We generated a dataset of 16060
simulated TEE images from participants of varied experience and use it to retrain
two CNN architectures (Alexnet, VGG), converted to perform regression. Three
reviewers provided ground truth labels by blindly grading the images with two
diﬀerent manual scores. Tested on a set of 2596 images, the developed CNN
architectures estimated the average reviewers’ score with a root mean square
error (RMSE) ranging from 7%-14%. This level of accuracy, which is near the
resolution of the average scores from the three evaluators, highlights the potential
of CNN algorithms for reﬁned performance evaluation.

2 Methods

2.1 Dataset generation

We experimented using the HeartWorks TEE simulation platform, (Inventive
Medical, Ltd, London, U.K.) a high-ﬁdelity VR simulator that emulates realistic
exam settings (Fig. 1). Synthetic US images are generated based on an anatomi-
cally accurate cardiac model, illustrated in Fig. 1b, that is deformable to mimic a
beating heart. A detector on the probe’s tip extracts the position and orientation
of the US scanning ﬁeld which are then used to graphically render the 2D US
slice (Fig. 1c) from the 3D model. The data collection study consisted of a single
TEE exam in which participants had to capture 10 US views, shown in Fig. 2 in

a speciﬁc sequence. The selected views are a subset of the 20 suggested views rec-
ommended by ASE/SCA [6] and include planes from every depth window of the
TEE exam (mid-esophageal, transgastric and deep-transgastric)). Experiments
were performed under supervision by a consultant anaesthetist that introduced
the study and relayed the sequence of views. For capturing and storing data
the participant used a foot-pedal to generate a full-HD image and a short video
(∼ 1.5s) of the imaged US plane. Each video contained 44 frames.

In total, 38 participants of varied experience performed the experiments. The
population included accredited anaesthetists having performed more than 500
exams, less experienced practitioners and trainees in the early stage of their res-
idency. Participants were allowed time to familiarise themselves with the setup
and the simulator. Manual scoring was blindly performed by three expert anaes-
thetists based solely on the acquired videos/images. Each view was assessed with
two distinct image quality metrics. The ﬁrst metric is a criteria-based score eval-
uated on a predetermined checklist, of which each item was assigned a binary
value (0-not met, 1-met). The checklists for two of the views are depicted in Ta-
ble 1 and are derived following the latest ASE/SCA imaging guidelines for each
view [6]. This technique broadly evaluates three attributes, the correct angula-
tion of the US probe in each view, the presence/visibility of speciﬁc heart tissue
and the proper positioning of the probe in the oesophageal lumen. The number
of items varied for diﬀerent views so did the maximum score. The percentage of
criteria (CP) met over the total number was used to provide a uniform measure
among all views. The second score is a general impression (GI) assessment of
the US video/image scored on a 0-4 scale, which assess the overall quality of
the acquired image. Grades from the three evaluators were averaged to obtain a
single mean score per US view for each volunteer. As expected the two scores are

highly correlated (ρ ∼ 0.93). Inter-rater variability was independently evaluated
for each view, using the interclass correlation coeﬃcient (ICC) and Krippen-
dorﬀ’s Alpha (KA). Both metrics show very good agreement between the three
evaluators with ICC ∼ 0.9 and KA ∼ 0.8 for all views.

Fig. 3 illustrates two examples in the opposite ends of the quality spectrum
from views 3 and 7. The average quality scores are given inset and we annotated
the elements in the images that satisfy the criteria in the checklist of each view,
provided in Table 1. The images on the left are of poor quality and only meet
a small number of the checklists’ items. For example the top left ME AV SAX
image has the correct probe rotation and visualises the three cusps of the aortic
valve. It fails to meet the rest of the criteria. The bottom left image of the
TG2C view, only achieved correct probe angulation, but because of inadequate
positioning fails to satisfy the rest of the criteria. Consequently, both CP and
GI scores are low, since both images on the left side are of unacceptable quality.
Images on the right side are examples of ideally imaged views fully satisfying
the respective checklists and achieving full marks in both metrics.

We recorded 365 video sequences from the 38 participants with 15 views
failing to store properly. For our investigation, we extracted all 16060 (i.e. 365
x 44) frames from the stored videos and used the mean manual scores as labels.
All frames from a given video were labelled with the average score of that view
on the premise that reviewers assigned their grades after watching the short

videos so we consider that the mark equally represents all frames. No probe
movement takes place in the videos, only the simulated beating of the heart
model. Therefore the qualitative attributes of the stored view are the same in all
frames. We divide the dataset using the 80% - 20% rule for training and testing,
considering the total number of volunteers. Frames from 32 participants were
designated for training (13464) and from 6 for testing (2596).

2.2 CNN Architectures

We opted to develop CNN models for performing a regression task and train
them to learn to estimate the performance score as a single continuous vari-
able; CP ∈ {0, . . . , 100}, GI ∈ {0, . . . 4}. Since the checklists’ criteria and their
number are diﬀerent among views, it was not feasible to structure and train a
single model for evaluating individual criteria for all views. This would require
a non-eﬃcient approach with separate sub-models per view. Hence a single CP
score per view was computed and estimated. We experimented with two estab-

lished CNN architectures namely, Alexnet and VGG, originally built to perform
image classiﬁcation tasks [7, 12]. We repurpose them by restructuring their out-
put stage and consider 10 available classes, one for each TEE view. The ﬁnal
fully-connected (FC) layer of both CNNs is resized with a dimension of 10. One
additional FC layer with output size d = 1 and linear activation is added to com-
plete the regression operation and estimate the score. For classifying the input
to one of the TEE views, softmax activation is applied after the FC layer with
d = 10. Eﬀectively we structure our network so that it can be trained to both
estimate the performance scores and recognize the corresponding view of the
input. Fig. 4 illustrates the two customised architectures with the added layers.

3 Experimentation and results

CNN models were implemented with the TensorFlow framework. The training
dataset was randomized and images were resized from 1200x1000, to 227x227
for Alexnet and 224x224 for VGG. Batches of 128 (Alexnet) and 64 (VGG) were
used. The mean square error was set as the loss function and gradient descent op-
timization with adaptive moment estimation was performed with a learning rate
of 0.001. Both networks were initialized with publicly available weights from the
ILSVRC challenge [7, 12], apart from the additional dense layers we introduced,
which were assigned random weights and trained from scratch. Backpropaga-
tion was used to update the weights. The two architectures were independently
trained for each performance metric and convergence was achieved after 2K it-
erations for Alexnet and after 12K for VGG. The models were also trained to
classify images to their respective view, achieving over 98% accuracy. Table 2
lists overall RMSE results and the RMSE on score intervals, from estimating
the two image quality scores on the 2596 testing images. Both models perform
adequately but,owing to its denser structure, VGG outperforms Alexnet signif-
icantly and has smaller error variability, providing excellent accuracy for both
metrics. To obtain a single score per video, similarly to the three evaluators, we
grouped the predictions of the frames from the same video and averaged them.

4 Conclusions

In this article we demonstrated the applicability of CNNs architectures for au-
tomated quality evaluation of TEE images. We collected a rich dataset of 16060
simulated images graded with two manual scores (CP, GI) assigned by three
evaluators. We experimented with two established CNN models, restructured to
perform regression and trained these to estimate the manual scores. Validated
on 2596 images, the developed models estimate the manual scores with high ac-
curacy. Alexnet achieved an overall RMSE of 16.23% and 0.83, while the denser
VGG had better performance achieving 7.28% and 0.42 for CP and GI respec-
tively. These very promising outcomes indicate the potential of CNN methods
for automated skill assessment in image-guided surgical and diagnostic proce-
dures. Future work will focus on augmenting the CNN models and investigating
their translational ability in evaluating the quality of real TEE images.
