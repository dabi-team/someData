ABSTRACT

Rapid variability before and near the maximum brightness of supernovae has the potential to provide a better understanding of nearly
every aspect of supernovae, from the physics of the explosion up to their progenitors and the circumstellar environment. Thanks to
modern time-domain optical surveys, which are discovering supernovae in the early stage of their evolution, we have the unique
opportunity to capture their intraday behavior before maximum. We present high-cadence photometric monitoring (on the order of
seconds-minutes) of the optical light curves of three Type Ia and two Type II SNe over several nights before and near maximum
light, using the fast imagers available on the 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory and the 1.2 m telescope at Kryoneri
Observatory in Greece. We applied diﬀerential aperture photometry techniques using optimal apertures and we present reconstructed
light curves after implementing a seeing correction and the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA, Kovács et al. 2005). TFA yielded the
best results, achieving a typical precision between 0.01 − 0.04 mag. We did not detect signiﬁcant bumps with amplitudes greater than
0.05 mag in any of the SNe targets in the VR-, R-, and I- bands light curves obtained. We measured the intraday slope for each light
curve, which ranges between -0.37−0.36 mag day−1 in broadband VR, -0.19−0.31 mag day−1 in R band, and -0.13−0.10 mag day−1
in I band. We used SNe light curve ﬁtting templates for SN 2018gv, SN 2018hgc and SN 2018hhn to photometrically classify the
light curves and to calculate the time of maximum. We provide values for the maximum of SN 2018zd after applying a low-order
polynomial ﬁt and SN 2018hhn for the ﬁrst time. We conclude that optimal aperture photometry in combination with TFA provides
the highest-precision light curves for SNe that are relatively well separated from the centers of their host galaxies. This work aims
to inspire the use of ground-based, high-cadence and high-precision photometry to study SNe with the purpose of revealing clues
and properties of the explosion environment of both core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae, the explosion mechanisms, binary star
interaction and progenitor channels. We suggest monitoring early supernovae light curves in hotter (bluer) bands with a cadence of
hours as a promising way of investigating the post-explosion photometric behavior of the progenitor stars.

1. Introduction

The increasing rate of discovery of bright supernovae (SNe) a
few days after their explosion and several days before their max-
imum light has opened a new window into the physics of SNe.
Time-domain surveys such as the All-Sky Automated Survey
for Supernovae1 (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014), the Aster-
oid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System2 (ATLAS; Tonry et al.
2018), the Zwicky Transient Facility3 (ZTF; Masci et al. 2019),
the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey4 (Drake et al. 2009),
and the DLT405 (Tartaglia et al. 2018) enable us to obtain quick
follow-up observations of infant SNe. They can be used to inves-
tigate the progenitor channels, their circumstellar environment,
and the nature of the explosions. Even though several SNe of

diﬀerent types (e.g. Type Ia and IIP) have shown peculiar signs
in their early light curves and spectra (early blue or UV excess,
carbon absorption lines), most photometric surveys probe SNe
on timescales of days and, therefore, their intraday behavior both
before and after maximum brightness remains unknown. Rapid,
high-cadence photometric follow-up observations of young Type
I, II or superluminous SNe are warranted to probe the properties
of their progenitors. Early photometric monitoring of Type Ia
SNe has revealed crucial characteristics of the explosive stars.
Many studies have already found intriguing clues of undulations
in very early light curves of SNe. Marion et al. (2016) reported
a signiﬁcant detection of excess luminosity in multiple ﬁlters at
16 and 15 days prior to maximum in the light curves of SN Ia
2012cg. They compared the light curves and the B–V colors to
the Kasen (2010) models and found that the observations are
consistent with models for the interaction between a SN Ia and a
main-sequence companion star of 6 M(cid:12). In this single degener-
ate scenario, the SN Ia will expand until it encounters a compan-
ion, when matter is compressed and heated. As the ejecta sur-
rounds the companion star and a shock is formed, a gap opens

aInitially, it was spectroscopically classiﬁed as a Type IIn by Zhang et al. (2018).
bInitially, it was classiﬁed as a normal Type II supernova. According to Singh et al. (2019), this SN is a 1987A-like event object.

in the layers of the ejecta material and emission from the shock-
heated material can escape through it (Marietta et al. 2000). Op-
tical and UV excess can be produced for a few days after the
explosion from the radiative diﬀusion of the deeper layers of the
ejecta. A similar case may have been observed for the Type Ia SN
iPTF14atg at early times, which was interpreted as the collision
of the heated ejecta with a binary companion. Strong but declin-
ing UV emission was reported within four days of its explosion
(Cao et al. 2015), along with another interesting feature, persis-
tent C II 6580 Å absorption. Early observations of the Type Ia
SN 2017cbv (Hosseinzadeh et al. 2017) and iPTF16abc (Miller
et al. 2018) revealed early blue bumps, along with a combination
of unburned material in the early optical spectra. These cannot
be explained by either SN shock breakout or the SN ejecta col-
liding with a stellar companion. The features were interpreted
as evidence for ejecta interaction with the diﬀuse circumstellar
material or an unusual nickel distribution, which were inferred
by comparing them to models. Recently, Fausnaugh et al. (2019)
used early-time light curves of 18 Type Ia SNe observed in the
ﬁrst six sectors of TESS data to constrain the radii of any com-
panion stars, and thus the progenitor channels.

Pre-maximum light curves of Type II SNe have not only re-
vealed properties of the progenitors, but have also similarly re-
ported evidence of bumps. Garnavich et al. (2016) demonstrated
the potential of high-cadence photometry of SNe, using Kepler
photometry of two Type II-P SNe. For the ﬁrst time they ob-
served the shock breakout in optical light and measured precise
rise times, as well as the radius of the progenitor red supergiants.
The very early observations of SN 2016X (Type II-P; Huang
et al. 2018), showed another possible UV peak within 1-2 days
of the explosion, which was assumed to be the breakout of a blast
shockwave through the outer envelope of the progenitor star af-
ter the core-collapse explosion. Early photometric observations
of SN 2017gmr in the U and B band (Andrews et al. 2019) re-
vealed undulations, which were not further interpreted. These re-
sults demonstrate the power of early discovery and high-cadence
monitoring of all types of SNe to constrain the progenitor chan-
nels and explosion mechanisms of SNe.

Ground-based high-precision photometric monitoring stud-
ies are crucial to provide evidence for such variability in the op-
tical light curves. The ﬁrst ground-based high-cadence study of
Bonanos & Boumis (2016) presented photometry of the nearby
Type Ia supernova SN2014J, 15–18 days after maximum in the
galaxy M82 (Fossey et al. 2014). They reported evidence for
rapid variability at a 0.02–0.05 mag level on timescales of 15–
60 min on four nights. The following scenarios were suggested
for the origin of the variability: (i) clumping of the ejecta (Hole
et al. 2010); (ii) interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar
material (Foley et al. 2014); (iii) asymmetry of the ejecta (Wang

& Wheeler 2008) and (iv) the onset of the secondary maximum
(Pinto & Eastman 2000; Jack et al. 2015).

No predictions exist, however, for the intraday behavior of
the photometric evolution of infant SNe, the duration of the
bumps and the presence of periodicity on short timescales. High-
cadence observations of explosive transients, therefore, provide
a way to probe such short timescales over which energy might
be produced. For these reasons, we observed several bright SNe
(Table 1) with the aim of exploring their short timescale behav-
ior and searching for evidence of rapid variability, which is not
probed by the vast majority of photometric surveys of transients.
We employed high-precision photometric techniques widely ap-
plied in the exoplanet community to analyze the data, which have
not yet been adopted by the SNe community. This work aims to
demonstrate how well these methods work for early SNe obser-
vations.

The paper is structured as follows: the observations and data
reduction are described in Section 2, the photometric methods
are presented in Section 3 and the analysis in Section 4. The re-
sults are given in Section 5, while the discussion and conclusions
follow in Section 6.

2. Observations and data reduction

The selection criteria for our target SNe were primarily based
on their spectroscopic classiﬁcation as young and bright SNe
(<18 mag at discovery). Tables 1 and 2 include the observa-
tions, the sample and its properties. Furthermore, as we aimed to
achieve high-precision photometry, we selected targets that were
not heavily contaminated by the host galaxy. The 2.3 m Aristar-
chos telescope and the 1.2 m Kryoneri telescope were employed
to observe the targets. These SNe were selected as the best avail-
able targets during our allocated telescope time. Finder charts
illustrating the locations of the SNe in their host galaxies are
shown in Figure 1. The targets were monitored for short-term
variability with exposure times that yielded a signal-to-noise ra-
tio (S/N) > 70. Typically, our exposures ranged from 20 s–120 s
with a median cadence of 2 min. Sequences of images of at least
1 hour were obtained, yielding 200–300 images in total per tar-
get for 1–5 nights, mainly before and near the maximum light
(Table 1).

Ritchey–Chretien Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observa-
tory to observe SNe 2018hgc, 2018hhn and 2018hna. RISE2

is used for detecting transiting exoplanets. The ﬁeld of view of
the instrument is 10(cid:48) × 10(cid:48), providing a pixel scale of 0.60(cid:48)(cid:48). The
instrument uses a single broad ﬁlter, similar to the V+R pass-
band.

We used the wide-ﬁeld, high-cadence camera system
(Xilouris et al. 2018), installed on the prime focus of the 1.2 m
Kryoneri telescope to observe SN 2018gv and 2018zd. The in-
strument consists of two Andor Zyla 5.5 cameras, each with
a 2560 × 2160 front-illuminated scientiﬁc CMOS (pixel size
0.06×0.06 µm2) resulting in a pixel scale of 0.4(cid:48)(cid:48) and a 17(cid:48) ×14(cid:48)
ﬁeld of view. It provides the means to record a target simultane-
ously in two diﬀerent wavelength bands. A dichroic with a cut-
oﬀ at 730 nm splits the light beam, sending each resulting beam
to a diﬀerent camera. The cameras are equipped with R and I-
band Johnson-Cousins ﬁlters.

It should be noted that at the time of the observations, it was
not clear from the literature that bumps are primarily present in
the blue bands. The observations only suggested that bumps ap-
pear soon after the time of explosion. For these reasons, we opted
to use the available cameras with faster readout times and larger
ﬁeld of views, which are ideal for diﬀerential photometry and
high-cadence observations, without taking the wavelength of the
available ﬁlters into account.

2.2. Observational methodology & reduction

In order to achieve high photometric accuracy and be sensitive
to low amplitude undulations, we adopted techniques from the
exoplanet community, with the purpose of eliminating the sys-
tematic errors. When performing diﬀerential photometry (Sec-
tion 3), accurate bias-subtraction and ﬂat-ﬁelding are of major
importance. According to Irwin et al. (2007), the Poisson noise
is 200 e− for a typical detector with a gain of a few e− ADU−1 and
the ﬂat illumination level is of 20,000 ADU pixel−1=40,000 e−
pixel−1. Thus, a typical photometric aperture with a radius of 3
pixels contributes ∼1 mmag photon noise. For this reason, we
obtained a considerable amount of biases (150-300 frames) and
twilight ﬂat-ﬁelds (25-100 frames) each night to reduce the Pois-
son noise to less than 0.2 mmag (Irwin et al. 2007). The bias
frames were averaged together using the minmax in the reject
option of the zerocombine task in IRAF with a view of keep-
ing radiation events out of the master bias frame. The master ﬂat
frame was the result of combining all the frames using a me-
dian mode. The median value is an excellent way of removing
the eﬀects of hot pixels and cosmic rays, so these extreme values
do not aﬀect the calculation, as they would, if they would aver-
aged. The reject option was set to avsigclip, in which case the
"typical" sigma would have been determined from the data itself
rather than an a priori knowledge of the noise characteristics of
the CCD. Other related issues that can limit the photometric pre-
cision are: i) the positioning of the telescope, ii) fringing issues,
and iii) the diﬀerential variations on the quantum eﬃciency of

the pixels. With the aim of minimizing the contribution of these
eﬀects, we repositioned each star almost on the same pixel of
the detector using the autoguiding system of each telescope. The
read-out-noise of the detectors are insigniﬁcant, as it can be as
low as a few e− (< 10e− for RISE2 and Andor Zyla cameras).

We performed the photometric reduction scheme of bias cor-
rection, trimming of the overscan and ﬂat-ﬁelding correction us-
ing standard routines in the IRAF6 ccdproc package. Aperture
photometry was extracted for each supernova, as the targets were
isolated (Figure 1). In cases where relatively large undulations
were visible in the light curves (e.g., SN 2018gv, Section 5), we

also used point spread function (PSF) photometry to assess the
signal.

team (private communication) of each SN, are shown in Figure 2.

unexpectedly during the observational nights with the imal2.
Imal2 is a task of VAPHOT, which is an improved version of
the IRAF task imalign and is intended for aligning a large num-
ber of frames. It will measure each frame and then shift it. It
does not stop, if a frame cannot be shifted in comparison with
imalign task. It keeps track which images have been shifted and
it makes an entry named IMSHIFT into the frame-header, and
will not measure or shift an image again. The header entry tells
the size of the x, y shifts, so reversing the shifting is possible.
The diﬀerential time-series photometry was based on CCD aper-
ture photometry performed using VAPHOT (Deeg 2013), a pack-
age that works within the IRAF environment, similar to the stan-
dard aperture photometry task phot. The choice of the optimally-
sized apertures was of high importance in obtaining photometric
points with the lowest possible noise. We used apcalc, a subrou-
tine of the VAPHOT package to measure the optimum aperture
radius. apcalc ﬁnds the zero point in the derivative ∂(S /N)/∂r,
where S is the signal, N is the noise and r is the aperture radii.
The algorithm calculates the values σpsf, Nph,tot and σ1pix using
the equations:

where S is the signal, Nph is the number of photons inside an
aperture of a radius r, σpsf is the width of a Gaussian PSF, Nph,tot
is the total number of photons in the limit of an inﬁnite aperture
from the star, N is the total noise inside the radius r and σscin is
the scintillation noise, which is a constant, regardless the magni-
tude of the star or the aperture used. The photon noise inside a
radius r from the star, σNph is given by:

across each frame as PSF stars with pstselect and we built a
semi-empirical PSF model. Using the centroid of a star as the
proﬁle center and the sky level as determined for aperture pho-
tometry in allstar, the PSF model is shifted and scaled to ﬁt the
observed frame by non-linear least-squares. The scaling yields
the magnitude estimate. We found the instrumental PSF magni-
tudes to be shifted by 0.08 mag compared to the aperture pho-
tometry measurements, while the light curve shape and features
remained identical.

4. Analysis
Initially, diﬀerential light curves were created by extracting the
instrumental magnitudes from the aperture photometry and tak-
ing the diﬀerence between the supernova magnitude and 10–
15 comparison star candidates inside the ﬁeld of view, which
previously had been checked for intrinsic variability. We then
followed two approaches to subtract systematic eﬀects. One ap-
proach was to remove the seeing-correlated eﬀects following Ir-
win et al. (2007). The other approach was the implementation of
the signal-reconstruction-mode, the Trend Filtering Algorithm
(TFA, Kovács et al. 2005) from the VARTOOLS program (Hart-
man & Bakos 2016) to ﬁlter all sources of systematic noise from
the light curves, while preserving real variability. In the ﬁnal SNe
light curves, we applied the least-squares regression line, which
is the line that makes the vertical distance from the data points
to the regression line as small as possible in order to ﬁnd the
intraday slope. Least squares ﬁtting is a way to ﬁnd the best ﬁt
curve or line for a set of points. In this technique, the sum of
the squares of the oﬀsets (residuals) are used to estimate the best
ﬁt instead of the absolute values of the oﬀsets, while the errors
are measured based on the distances of the data points from the
ﬁtting curve.

4.1. Seeing-correlated variations

The uncertainty σBG(r) of
the sky-
background to the total signal within the aperture is calculated
by:

the contribution of

σBG(r) = σ1pixr

√

π,

(3.4)

where σ1pix is the average noise of one background pixel. The ra-
tio of the above equations gives the S/N, the well known "CCD
equation" (Howell 1989). Aperture photometry was performed
with radii selected to yield the maximum S/N. apcalc ﬁnds the
optimum aperture diameter in units of the FWHM of the PSF
and VAPHOT performs the aperture photometry on a series of
frames, with aperture sizes determined individually for each star
in a reference frame. We selected the frame with the lowest
FWHM as the reference image.

Irwin et al. (2007) demonstrated the strong correlation between
the FWHM and the magnitude for blended objects. As the
FWHM of the point sources increases due to variations in the
seeing, the amount of blended ﬂux increases. This method can be
used for ﬁnding objects that are blended and subtracting the vari-
ations in FWHM. To characterize the level of blending in each
light curve, we measured the seeing-correlated shifts of the tar-
get from its median magnitude. This was done by calculating the
correlation between the oﬀset of the magnitude to the median as
a function of the measured seeing and by ﬁtting a quadratic poly-
nomial. Figure 3 demonstrates this methodology for SN 2018zd
and Figure A.10 for all the objects. We therefore subtracted the
ﬁtting function from the light curve of our targets. Figures 4 and
A.3 illustrate the subtraction of the seeing correlation from the
instrumental light curves of our target.

We proceeded to perform PSF photometry with DAOPHOT
(Stetson 2011) on SN 2018gv, which indicated signs of variabil-
ity or bumps after the analysis (Section 4). We aimed to assess
the contamination of the host galaxy and validate the accuracy of
the aperture photometry results. We ﬁrst ran daoﬁnd in IRAF to
ﬁnd all the stars on each frame above the appropriate brightness
threshold, discriminating between extended sources, stars, cos-
mic rays and CCD defects and performed aperture photometry
with phot. We then chose a set of bright isolated stars spread

Image and photometric reduction methods cannot identify weak
and short-duration periodic irregular dimmings in the presence
of noise and various systematics. To address this deﬁciency, sev-
eral methods have been developed such as Kruszewski & Seme-
niuk (2003), SysRem by Tamuz et al. (2005), TFA by Kovács
et al. (2005), and PDT (Photometric DeTrending Algorithm Us-
ing Machine Learning) by Kim et al. (2009) to remove system-
atics during the post-processing phase. A detailed comparison
of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. Possible

The resulting values of white and red noise measurements

binned rms residuals as a function of the bin size plot for the
photometric data of SN 2018gv on the second night. The rms
of the binned residuals, rmsN, is shown as a black curve. The
grey error bars represent the uncertainty of rmsN. The red curve
shows the expected rmsσN in the absence of correlated noise.
The saw-tooth shape of the black curve arises from the change
in M, which becomes more signiﬁcant as N increases.

4.4. Light curve ﬁtting

We ﬁnally proceeded with a basic analysis of the SN light curves
in Figure 2 by ﬁtting Type I and Type II templates through the
SNcosmo framework (Barbary et al. 2016). For Type Ia light
curves we used the most recent version of the SALT2 light curve
ﬁtter (SALT2.4, Betoule et al. 2014; Guy et al. 2010). SALT2
characterizes the ﬂux density of a given SN as function of time t
and wavelength λ as:

f (t, λ) = x0[(M0(t, λ) + x1 M1(t, λ)]ecCL(λ),

(4.3)

where x0, x1 and c are the normalization, shape and color param-
eters, respectively. M0, M1 are the zeroth and ﬁrst components
of the model, and CL is the color law, which gives the extinction
in magnitudes for c = 1.

For Type II light curves, the spectral model for each SN that

we used is given by:

f (p, λ) = A × M(p, λ),

(4.4)

where M is the ﬂux deﬁned on a grid in phase p and wavelength
λ and A is the amplitude, a single free parameter of the model.
The resulting ﬁtting parameters for each SN are presented in
Section 5.

5. Results

5.1. SN 2018gv

SN 2018gv was discovered by Brimacombe et al. (2018a) on
UT 2018-01-15.68 at 16.5 mag in NGC 2525, a galaxy found in
the NED Galaxy Catalogue, with a distance modulus (m − M)
of 31.1 mag, 16.8 Mpc away (Tully et al. 2013). Spectroscopic
classiﬁcations with the LRIS spectrograph on the 10-m Keck
I telescope and with EFOSC on the ESO New Technology
Telescope at La Silla in the framework of ePESSTO8 using
SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007), indicated that SN 2018gv was
a very young, normal Type Ia supernova, 10-15 days before

tions for SN 2018zd. The panel shows the correlation between
the oﬀset of the magnitude to the median as a function of the
measured seeing. The data are plotted as red crosses and the
quadratic polynomial ﬁt is illustrated by the solid black line.

sources of these colored eﬀects are due to uncorrected instru-
mental eﬀects, the changing of the observing conditions, the im-
perfections in the data reduction or intrinsic systematic varia-
tions. These systematic and random noise sources are respon-
sible for creating trends in time-series data that undermine the
signals from the stars.

For our analysis we used TFA from the VARTOOLS pro-
gram (Hartman & Bakos 2016), which searches for temporal
features observed in the frame and subtracts the part of the target
time-series that is produced by the systematics. TFA utilizes the
fact that the same types of systematics appear in several stars in
the same frame. For this reason, a list of 10 light curve templates
for stars, which appeared non-variable through aperture photom-
etry in the same ﬁeld of view, was created manually to compute
the systematic errors in each frame for each target. TFA uses all
these available reference stars of the given frame in the template
and reproduces each target light curve by a linear combination
of these templates, optimized by least-squares. After a signal has
been identiﬁed in the residuals between the original time-series
and the systematics computed by TFA, the shape of the signals is
reconstructed. Figure 4 demonstrates the implementation of TFA
(bottom panel) compared to the initial instrumental light curve
(top panel). Photometric accuracy close to the photon noise was
achieved and the rms was substantially improved in all cases. Ta-
ble 3 shows the values of light curve rms scatter before and after
the implementation of TFA.

4.3. Noise estimation

We estimated the red and white noise for light curves that
showed undulations, which remained after applying corrections
for systematics, which are relatively common for ground-based
data. We implemented the time-averaging procedure outlined
by Winn et al. (2008) through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analysis to quantify the signiﬁcance of the variabil-
ity or bumps detected. We derived the residuals after subtracting
the best-ﬁtting model, in our case the quadratic polynomial ﬁt,
from the data points. Then, we measured the mean values of the
residuals that have been split into time-ordered bins of N ele-
ments, which are not overlapping, and we calculated the root
mean square of the binned residuals, rmsN. The process was re-
peated for a range of bin sizes (number of data points in each
bin) from one to half the data size. The uncertainty of rmsN is
computed as σrms = rmsN/
2M (Cubillos et al. 2017), where

curves from Shappee et al. (2014) and Kochanek et al. (2017)
to ﬁt the parameters of a SALT2 model to the photometric light
curve data (Figure 6). We measured a SALT2 shape parameter
of x1 = 1.14 ± 0.05, which is consistent with the properties of
Type Ia SNe (Yao et al. 2019), a color parameter c = 2.51 ± 0.03
and we determined that SN 2018gv peaked on HJD 2458150.69
± 0.03 in the V-band, which is in strong agreement with the

measurements of Yang et al. (2019).

Optical photometry of SN 2018gv was obtained using the
1.2 m Kryoneri telescope on HJD 2458141.4, nine days before
the maximum light according to the SALT2 ﬁt. The observations
were conducted during three runs on the same night because of
interruptions due to the weather conditions (clouds). Images in
the R and I bands were obtained simultaneously, with an expo-

sure time of 30 s and a total time coverage of 118 minutes in each
band. We kept the target near the same pixel of the detector using
the telescope guiding system. The light curve from the ﬁrst sec-
ond seems to have some variations of 0.15 mag (Figure A.2) even
after the subtraction of the seeing-correlated noise. We therefore
used nine non-variable comparison stars to create a trendlist tem-
plate to subtract the systematic eﬀects. After the implementation
of TFA, the rms was improved from 0.27 to 0.02 mag and the
variations decreased to an amplitude of 0.04 mag in the R band.
The rms was also improved signiﬁcantly in the I band (Table
3). On the third observing run the light curve shows a 0.05 mag
bump (Figure 4), which does not appear to be related to see-
ing or to systematic eﬀects. We continued with PSF photome-
try, with the aim of validating our photometric results. The same
trend with 0.05 mag amplitude was also apparent in the PSF pho-
tometry. We proceeded with the MCMC analysis to estimate the
time-correlated noise. The rms of the binned residuals was com-
puted to be 0.02 mag with a number of bins > 20. Therefore the
0.05 mag bump cannot be considered as a signiﬁcant undulation
after the red noise estimation due to its small amplitude. Most of
the trends on the ﬁrst run were due to seeing-correlated eﬀects
and were removed. The ﬁnal light curve has an improved rms
of 0.01 mag (Figure A.1). The mean intraday decline slope was
measured to be 0 mag day−1 in R band and –0.13 mag day−1 in I
band (Table 3).

5.2. SN 2018zd

SN 2018zd (otherwise known as Gaia18anr or ATLAS18mix)
was discovered by Itagaki (2018b) on UT 2018-03-02.49 at
17.8 mag in NGC 2146, a galaxy found in the Ned Galaxy Cata-
logue with m − M = 31.28 mag, 18 Mpc away (Adamo et al.
2012). It was classiﬁed by Zhang et al. (2018) on UT 2018-
03-05.7 as a Type IIn supernova, thirteen days before maximum
light. We used the ASAS-SN V-band light curves (Shappee et al.
2014; Kochanek et al. 2017) to ﬁt Nugent’s templates (Nugent

ting model was applied to estimate the tmax.

et al. 2002)9 and applied SNANA ﬁtting code (Kessler et al.
2009) for Type IIn SNe. As SNe Type IIn show intrisic variety in
their properties and the templates are based on only a few events
(SN 1999el, SN 2006ez and SN 2006ix), the analysis resulted in
a poor ﬁt. Therefore, we applied a low-order polynomial ﬁt and
we estimated that the SN peaked on HJD 2458188.6, which is
the ﬁrst determination of the SN maximum. Observations were
obtained at Kryoneri Observatory, initially based on the spectro-
scopic classiﬁcations as a young Type II SN during three photo-
metric nights. According to the V-band ﬁt, it was observed dur-
ing the maximum light in the R and I bands. Figure A.3 shows
the light curves for the ﬁrst observing night.

The photometric analysis yielded a precision below 0.05 mag
level and did not indicate any undulations in the light curves. We
applied the TFA with a template of ten comparison stars, whose
light constancy was checked using diﬀerential photometry. The
estimated values for the intranight decline rate and the rms be-
fore and after the implementation of TFA are shown in the last
two columns of Table 3 for the R and I bands, respectively. Most
of them were caused by seeing transitions as the second panel
of each ﬁgure shows. On the second night there was a drop of
∼ 0.2 mag, which was subtracted with the TFA (ﬁrst panel of
Figure A.4). The drop was due to an image shift that was not
perfectly corrected with the image alignment step. The ﬁrst part
of the light curve coverage of the second night of SN 2018zd is
excluded from the analysis and Figure A.4 (104 data points) due
to the consecutive large variations of seeing. Most of the trends
on the third run (Figure A.5) were due to variable seeing. The
ﬁnal light curve had an improved rms of 0.04 mag.

5.3. SN 2018hgc

SN 2018hgc (otherwise ASASSN-18xr, MLS181006:004205-
023744 or ATLAS18wrj) was discovered at 17.9 mag on
UT 2018-10-10 by the ASAS-SN group (Brimacombe et al.
2018b) in 2MASX J00420581-0237394 (otherwise WISEA
J004205.96-023739.1), a galaxy found in the NED Galaxy Cat-
alogue at a luminosity distance of 216 Mpc, which implies
m − M = 36.68 mag. The luminosity distance was derived us-
ing the redshift and the Cosmology-Corrected Quantities Ho =
73.00 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωmatter = 0.27 and Ωvacuum = 0.73. On UT
2018-10-14, it was classiﬁed as a Type Ia supernova (Dimitri-
adis et al. 2018). We used the ASAS-SN g-band light curve to

ﬁt the parameters of a SALT2 model to photometric light curve
data and to calculate the maximum date for the ﬁrst time. We
measured a SALT2 shape parameter of x1 = 4.8 ± 1.1, which is
consistent with the properties of Type Ia SNe (Yao et al. 2019),
a color parameter c = 25.19 ± 0.61 and we determined that SN
2018hgc peaked on HJD 2458411.44 ± 0.32 in the g-band (Fig-
ure A.11).

The photometric data were obtained with the Aristarchos
telescope approximately four days before the maximum light.
The target was observed for two consecutive nights with an
exposure time of 60–90s in the VR broadband ﬁlter. The re-
constructed light curves for both nights seem smooth below
0.05 mag, after the systematic errors were subtracted. The signs
of bumps with an amplitude of ∼ 0.04 mag cannot be considered
as rapid variability due to the large scatter. The rms improved
on both nights after the implementation of TFA (Table 3) and
the intraday decline rate was ∼ 0.31 ± 0.40 and –0.18 ± 0.01
mag day−1. Figure A.6 illustrates the results of the analysis of
the photometric data.

5.4. SN 2018hhn

SN 2018hhn (otherwise known as ATLAS18wrh or Gaia18del)
was ﬁrstly discovered by Grzegorzek (2018) in UGC 12222 on
UT 2018-10-14, at 17.1 mag and was classiﬁed by Prentice
(2018) as a Type Ia supernova approximately 11 days before
maximum light. The distance of its host is about z = 0.029,
which implies a m − M = 35.11 mag, 105 Mpc away (Springob
et al. 2009). We use the ATLAS o-band light curves (Shappee
et al. 2014; Kochanek et al. 2017) to ﬁt the parameters of a
SALT2 model to the photometric light curve data. We measured
a SALT2 shape parameter of x1 = 0.51 ± 0.69, which is consis-
tent with the properties of Type Ia SNe (Yao et al. 2019), a color
parameter c = −1.51 ± 0.48 and we measured that SN 2018hhn
peaked on HJD 2458417.10 ± 0.62 in o-band, which is the ﬁrst
determination of the SN maximum (Figure A.11).

We obtained observations between +2 to +6 days after maxi-
mum, using the 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope for four nights (Fig-
ures A.7 and A.8 present the light curves). The photometric re-
sults (bottom panel of Figure A.8) indicate stable light curves
with no undulations above 0.05 mag after the subtraction of the
systematic errors with TFA. The rms was improved to 0.01–
0.07 mag and the intraday decline rate was measured to range
between −0.37 ± 0.05 to 0.36 ± 0.24 mag day−1 over the four
observing nights.

5.5. SN 2018hna

SN 2018hna (otherwise known as Gaia18dﬀ or ZTF18acbwaxk)
was discovered by Itagaki (2018a) in UCG 7534 on 2018-10-23,
at 16.3 mag and was classiﬁed by Prentice et al. (2018) and Rho
et al. (2019), 39 days later, as a normal rising Type II supernova.
It appeared to have a low absolute magnitude and long rise time.
It was located at a distance of 10.5 Mpc (Karachentsev et al.
2013), which implies a m − M = 30.11 mag, hosted by a possi-
ble metal poor faint dwarf galaxy found in the Ned Galaxy Cat-
alogue. We used the ATLAS o-band light curve and attempted
to ﬁt Nugent’s templates (Nugent et al. 2002) for Type II and
IIn (based on blackbody templates from Di Carlo et al. (2002))
as well as Type IIP/IIL templates from Sako et al. (2011) and
Type IIP, IIn and II-pec from SNANA software (Kessler et al.
2009). None of the templates provided a good ﬁt covering the
early and late evolution of its light curve. According to Singh
et al. (2019), SN 2018hna is a 1987A-like event object, which is
relatively rare, and not well represented by normal Type IIP SN
templates. For this reason, we derived the peak epoch after ﬁt-
ting a low-order polynomial curve to the ATLAS data and HJD
2458499.1 is adopted as the epoch of maximum.

Two nights of photometric VR observations were obtained
with the 2.3-m Aristarchos telescope at Helmos Observatory, 80
and 76 days before the peak brightness according to the polyno-
mial ﬁt. The light curves of the SN (Figure A.9), after the imple-

mentation of TFA for both nights, do not show any signiﬁcant
undulation, as the rms was improved to 0.01 mag. The intraday
slope ranged from 0.01 ± 0.01 to 0.29 ± 0.14 mag day−1(Table
3).

6. Discussion and conclusions

The exact shape of the light curves of SNe in the early stages
contains critical information about the properties of the progen-
itors (initial radii, explosion mechanisms), the existence and the
composition of the circumstellar environment and the character-
istics of any companion stars (Piro et al. 2010; Rabinak & Wax-
man 2011; Piro & Morozova 2016; Kochanek 2019). Theoretical
models of SNe do not predict the behavior of SNe light curves
on short timescales (minutes or hours), which might be the key
observation for studying the progenitors of SNe and their cir-
cumstellar material.

Theoretically, the light emanating from SNe originates from
the following: a) radioactive decay of nickel and its associated
daughter products in the ejecta, b) energy that comes from the
collision with dense circumstellar material, which converts the
kinetic energy of the ejecta into radiative energy (e.g. SN 2010jl,
Zhang et al. 2012; Taddia et al. 2013; Piro & Nakar 2013; Piro
& Morozova 2016), c) shock heating caused by the interaction
of the ejecta with the companion star, in the case of binary sys-
tems and d) shock-deposited energy from the initial explosion.
The key feature of these events is that the energy deposition and
subsequent radiation do not need to follow a smooth, continuous
form but may exhibit discrete, brief events as the 1–2 day bumps
that have already been reported in a number of young SNe. Re-
cently, models produced by Moriya et al. (2018) predict u and g
band bumps on timescales of days in the early stages of SNe due
to high-density structures in the circumstellar medium caused by
the wind acceleration close to the progenitor.

Supernova explosions have mean expansion velocities on
the order of 2,000-10,000 km s−1. If we assume that the outer
edge of the explosion moves at 104 km s−1, it will cover a dis-
tance of 2 × 1015 cm over several weeks. Therefore, it is more
likely for supernovae to exhibit features of variability during
the ﬁrst week after the explosion. Moreover, SNe light curves
with blue bumps in the early evolutionary stages are now ob-
served and reported more often, due to the increased observing
cadence of many time-domain surveys; however, the origin of
these events remains controversial. A recent example is the Type
II SN 2017gmr (Andrews et al. 2019): SWIFT and ground based
observations soon after the explosion revealed a short timescale
(below one day) bump at a scale of 0.1-0.2 mag in U and B
bands, which has not been further investigated. The observation
of the intraday behavior of SNe is one of the keys for opening a
new window to the study of SNe light curves and their properties,
which at the moment lack predictions from theoretical models.

We have presented the ﬁrst systematic, ground-based, high-
cadence photometric study of early-time light curves of ﬁve
bright SNe. We suggested methods adopted from the exoplanet
community that can be applied to SNe light curve analysis to
improve photometric precision and to validate the bumps that
have been recently reported and we have demonstrated that these
techniques do work. Even though we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
bumps in our observed light curves, undulations in bluer bands
cannot be ruled out. The observation and analysis of the SNe
light curves included four main steps, which we propose as a
methodology for identifying early bumps:

Article number, page 10 of 22

1. The acquisition of a large number of calibration ﬂats and bi-
ases and the utilization of the guiding system to keep the
target on the same pixel.

2. The implementation of both optimal aperture photometry
and PSF photometry to create the light curves. Optimal aper-
ture photometry seemed to be suﬃcient for SNe well sepa-
rated from the center of the host galaxy.

3. The subtraction of seeing variations from the initial light
curves, which cause variability, following the procedure de-
scribed in Irwin et al. (2007).

4. The subtraction of systematic eﬀects and the improvement
of the photometric accuracy below 0.05 mag using the Trend
Filtering algorithm (Hartman & Bakos 2016).

Our main results are the following:

1. SALT2, Type II templates, and low-order polynomial ﬁts
were applied to the ASAS-SN and ATLAS light curves in
order to calculate the time of peak. A photometric classiﬁca-
tion of the Type of SN 2018gv, SN 2018hgc and SN 2018hhn
was derived from the template light curve ﬁtting. The dates
of light curve maximum for SNe 2018zd and 2018hhn have
been reported for the ﬁrst time. SN 2018hna showed a poor
ﬁt due to its long rise time, which cannot be predicted by the
present templates.

2. We measured the intraday slope of the early light curves by
applying a linear function to each reconstructed light curve.
The estimation of the intraday slope ranged from -0.37 ±
0.05 to 0.36 mag ± 0.24 day−1.

3. For SN 2018gv, which indicated undulations at a level of
0.05 mag, a MCMC analysis was performed to account for
both white and correlated noise (red) in order to quantify and
constrain the accuracy of the photometric results. The bump
did not appear to be signiﬁcant after the noise estimation.
4. We achieved a photometric precision of 1–4 mmag per target
on all nights. The sources did not show any sign of undula-
tion above 0.05 mag after the implementation of the above
methods during our observations in the R, I, and VR bands.
This does not rule out the existence of possible undulations
in bluer bands.

A key component of future work will be to investigate un-
dulations in the bluest bands with the tools that have been pre-
sented in this work and conﬁdently identify structure in the early
time light curves. We encourage the SN community to under-
take ground-based, high-cadence photometric surveys and ob-
tain blue photometric observations of diﬀerent types of SNe as
close as possible to the explosion time in order to understand
whether bumps are ubiquitous. Wide-ﬁeld transient surveys will
discover and monitor nearby infant SNe over the next few years
and will provide us with more instances of early SN discoveries,
which are needed to investigate intraday undulations. A large
sample of young SNe will enable stringent constraints on the
behavior of SNe light curves and will reveal properties of the ex-
plosion mechanisms and the circumstellar environment of every
type of SNe.
