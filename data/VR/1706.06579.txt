Abstract
Virtual Reality (VR) becomes accessible to mimic a "real-like" world now. People who have a VR experience usually can be
impressed by the immersive feeling, they might consider themselves are actually existed in the VR space. Self-consciousness
is important for people to identify their own characters in VR space, and illusory ownership can help people to "build" their
"bodies". The rubber hand illusion can convince us a fake hand made by rubber is a part of our bodies under certain circum-
stances. Researches about autoscopic phenomena extend this illusory to the so-called full body illusion. We conducted 3 type of
experiments to study the illusory ownership in VR space as it shows in Figure 1, and we learned: Human body must receive the
synchronized visual signal and somatosensory stimulus at the same time; The visual signal must be the ﬁrst person perceptive;
the subject and the virtual body needs to be the same height as much as possible. All these illusory ownerships accompanied by
the body temperature decreases, where the body is stimulated.

1. Introduction

William James [Jam13] developed a theory of two selves. The ﬁrst
one is the "Me" self, and the second one is the "I" self. The "me"
self refers to the aspects of someone that come from that person’s
experiences. The "me" self can break down into three sections, The
Material Self, The Social Self, and The Spiritual Self. The "I" self
is categorized into the thinking self. The Pure Ego was the name
given to the "I" self. James also thinks our body is the innermost
part of the material self. Gallagher’s [Gal00] studies between phi-
losophy of mind and the other cognitive science that are focused on
two aspects of self. They are the minimal self and the narrative self.
The minimal self is the procedure of human brain processes and
ecologically embedded body. He considered sense of ownership is
an integration of information (i. e. visual, tactile, somatosensory
etc.) processing in human brains. According to these various stud-

ies, we know the illusory ownership can be evoked in some condi-
tions that the other objects can be recognized as the subjects’ own
body parts by themselves. Recently, due to the fast development of
both computer graphic technologies and computer hardware per-
formances, VR has gained more attention now. It can replicate an
environment to allow the users achieving an immersive experience.
We have studied approaches and methods that can evoke the illu-
sory ownership in the VR environment. Especially, we use the Head
Mount Display (HMD) to evoke illusory ownerships with various
conditions.

2. Previous researches

Botvinick and Cohen reported a phenomenon that called Rubber
Hand Illusion (RHI) [BC98], which a rubber hand placed in front

 
 
 
 
 
 
P. Xiong, C. Sun & D. Cai / "Synchronize" to VR Body: Full Body Illusion in VR Space

of a healthy subject can misunderstand it as his or her own hand
under certain circumstances. Many researches on RHI have been
conducted recently. Some researches replaced the rubber hand with
other objects such as: a table [AR03], a rake, a curtain, and another
stick-shape objects [HP10]. They all made it clear that the subjects
felt if these objects were the part of their own bodies, but the other
studies (using stick-shape object [TH05]) also pointed out that the
non-hand-shape objects cannot evoke the RHI.

Full Body Illusion (FBI) is based on the research of human brain
disease that called Autoscopic Phenomena. The patients have a
strong illusion of the ownership of other human bodies. However,
the FBI can also occur in healthy humans. It possesses a similar
arousal method to the RHI. The research by Petkova & Ehrsson
[PE08] and Slater et al. [SPES09] used both a ﬁrst-person visual
perceptive of the mannequin and tactile stimulus to the test sub-
jects. The report evaluates the subjects’ illusion using verbal ques-
tionnaires. Lenggenhager et al. [LMB09] and Aspell et al. [ALB09]
tries some tests using a third person visual perceptive input, but the
subjects still felt the illusion by using the same evaluation methods.

In most of previous researches, the illusory ownership was evalu-
ated by the investigations about how strong the subjects can feel the
illusory ownership. However, we think oral investigations are still
unconvincing. With the other methods, electromyography (EMG)
was used to measure the difference of muscle activities when a
strong blow to the fake hand [TYY∗12]. They also veriﬁed that
the EMG difference and strength of illusory ownership are posi-
tively related. Furthermore, in [AR03], the human skin resistivity
was also measured if an illusory ownership is evoked. He/she is
easy to sweat when he/she is nervous or feels fear. So they made an
assumption that skin resistance can vary when illusory ownership
was evoked.

3. RHIs and FBIs measured by body temperature

In this paper, we evaluated the strength of illusory ownership by
measuring the body temperature, which based on the research of
Moseley et al. [MOV∗08]. When the RHI was evoked, the subjects’
hand temperatures were dropped.

3.1. RHI

First, we tried to evoke the RHI by using a virtual hand dis-
played in a HMD. There were 2 group of participants. Here, 8
participants (2 females and 6 males, mean±SD age = 24.5±1.59
years) were tested in RHI trial (Trial 1) and RHI control trial
(Trial 2) in actual world base on the experiment of Moseley et
al. [MOV∗08]. The other 8 participants (3 females and 5 males,
mean±SD age=25±2.27 years) were tested in RHI in VR space
trial (Trial 3). None of them have any cognition diseases and the
knowledge about RHI. We were keeping the indoor temperature
under 25oC. The rubber hand and virtual hand displayed in HMD
are the right hand.

Trial 1: Participants sat with their right hand resting on a ta-
ble, and we set a block to prevent the participants seeing their own
hand. A rubber right hand was place in front of the participants and
a towel was placed over the participants’ shoulder, hand, and the

end of the rubber hand as if the rubber hand was connected to the
participants’ shoulder. Then we use two paintbrushes to stroke the
rubber hand and the participants’ subject hand synchronously.

Trial 2: The rubber hand was removed. The participants were
instructed to look at the position where the rubber hand was placed
in Trial 1. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Trial 3: Participants sat and wore a HMD, where a virtual hand
resting on a virtual table are displayed as they are in front of the
participant. A paintbrush stroking animation is added on the virtual
hand with the same stroking pattern to the previous trials. The other
conditions remain unchanged. Paintbrush stroking in actual world
keep synchronized to the animation in VR space.

Method: For each trial, the test lasts 5 minutes and the hand’s
temperature was taken from a single spot on each participant’s hand
by a non-contact thermometer in every 30 seconds, which gave a
total of 11 temperature readings per participant.

Figure 2: The average hand temperatures of all subjects in Trial
1, 2, and 3.

As we expected, in Trial 1 and Trial 3, all participants’ hand
temperatures decreased about 0.6 degrees as illustrated in Figure
2. The T-test of the average temperature between Trial 2 (control)
and Trial 3 (VR RHI) is [t (10, 0.005) = 3.16, P = 0.0002 < 1%].
It has a signiﬁcant difference. However, the T-test of Trial 1 (RHI)
and Trial 3 (VR RHI) is [t (10, 0.025) = 2.228, P = 0.4592 > 5%].
There is no signiﬁcant difference between Trail 1 and Trial 3. Thus,
we can safely conclude that RHI in VR space (Trial 3) and the RHI
in actual world are related. The RHI can be also evoked in VR space
and the skin temperature decreases can be observed.

3.2. FBI

According to [LMB09] and [PE08], they evaluated the strength of
illusory ownership in both First Person Perceptive (1pp) and Third
Person Perceptive (3pp). In their tests, the subjects were asked if
they felt the body they are observing were their own body or the
mannequin stand in front of them were themselves. We considered,
if there was a contradiction between 1pp and 3pp which can affect
the physical body temperature decreases and it may not affect the
result of investigation.

Here, 5 participants (1 female and 4 males, mean±SD age =
24.5±1.59 years) were participant in both 1pp and 3pp experiment.
None of them have any cognition diseases and the knowledge about
RHI and FBI. We keep the indoor temperature under 25oC. For
each participant, we provided both a sleeveless shirt with two sym-
metrical holes on its back (the same level as shoulder blade) and a

shorts to the knee with two symmetrical holes, in order to measure
temperatures in 6 spots (four on the limbs and two on the back).
Then, the participants sat and wore the HMD.

1pp experiment: Participants sat and could see a seated virtual
body as if the participants see their own body through the HMD
screen. The participants’ chest was stroked while the virtual body’s
chest was stroked either synchronously or asynchronously.

3pp experiment: Participants sat and could see a virtual man-
nequin as if the mannequin was sitting in front of them through
the HMD. The participant’s chest and the mannequin’s chest was
stroked either synchronously or asynchronously.

Method: Two experiments were performed in order. Each ex-
periment has two trials, a synchronous and an asynchronous trial.
For each trial, stokes lasted 5 minutes and the body temperatures
were taken from the 6 spots in order by a non-contact thermometer
in every 30 seconds, which gave 11 body temperatures per spot, 66
body temperature measurements at one trial per participant.

Figure 3: (a) The temperature comparison between synchronous
and asynchronous stroke in 6 spot. (b) The average hand tempera-
ture changing between 1pp and 3pp synchronous trial.

In 1pp experiment, the body temperatures variations are show-
ing in Figure 3. (a). We set the synchrony and the temperatures
in different spots to be two factors. The average body temperatures
at each symmetrical spots on the left and right were evaluated by
ANOVA test. The signiﬁcant temperature differences in the sym-
metrical left and right spots such as: the left hand and the right
hand [F (2,4) = 0.001, P = 0.982 > 5%], the left calf and the right
calf [F (2,4) = 0.001, P = 0.687 > 5%], and the left back and the
right back [F (2,4) = 0.001, P = 0.778 > 5%] are all rejected. On
the other hand, when we assume the synchronicities are the signif-
icant factors, the all signiﬁcant average temperature differences on
the hand [F (2,4) = 0.019 < 5%], the calf [F (2,4) = 0.005 < 5%],
and the back [F (2,4) = 0.015 < 5%] cannot be rejected. Therefore,
we can safely conclude that a similar mechanism of human brain
functions can work on both RHI and FBI. Furthermore, when the il-
lusory ownership is evoked, a consistent temperature dropping can
be observed.

Next, we illustrated the average hand temperature variations of
both 1pp and 3pp synchronous trials by using T-test as indicated
in Figure 3. (b). There is a signiﬁcant difference [t (10, 0.005) =
3.169, P = 0.0008<1%]. We only utilized the temperature on the
hand, because we have already found that the signiﬁcant tempera-
ture differences over the 6 spots are rejected. For 1pp experiment,
there was a signiﬁcant difference in hand temperature decreases [F

(2,4) = 0.001, P = 0.019 < 5%]. But for 3pp experiment [F (2,4) =
1.861, P = 0.198 > 5%], the signiﬁcant temperature decreases was
rejected. But, the previous researches by [LMB09] and [ALB09]
claims that they did evoked the FBI in 3pp and they did not show
any physical evidence whether the FBI is evoked or not. We ob-
served these physical evidences only in 1pp experiment. Therefore,
we considered the actual systemic illusion occurred on both physi-
cal body and mental spirit only in the ﬁrst person perceptive.

4. FBI for different size virtual bodies

As some other researches suggest FBI can be affected by the au-
thenticity of virtual mannequin. Banakou et al. [BGS13] tested with
bigger and smaller virtual mannequins. In their tests, the subjects
gave positive oral answers on the illusory ownership for the both
conditions. Here, we intended to accept more explicit responses
from the subjects varying the body sizes.

There were 10 participants (all male, mean±SD age =
25.5±1.25 years) with the average height 175 cm. None of them
have any cognition diseases and the knowledge about RHI and FBI.
We kept the indoor temperature under 25oC. And prepared 4 differ-
ent size virtual bodies with the height of 140cm, 175cm, 250cm and
500cm. Using each different height body, the participants wore the
HMD, and were provided 5 minutes to adapt to their new bodies.

140cm experiment: A 140cm height mannequin was displayed
sitting in front of a mirror as participants could see themselves in
the mirror. There are two trials, each participant’s chest was stroked
while the mannequin’s chest was stroked either synchronously or
asynchronously. In the end of each trial, participants were asked if
they felt the ownership to the mannequin.

175cm experiment: A 175cm height mannequin was displayed.

The other procedures were identical to 140cm experiment.

250cm experiment: A 250cm height mannequin was displayed.

The other procedures were identical to 140cm experiment.

500cm experiment: A 500cm height mannequin was displayed.

The other procedures were identical to 140cm experiment.

Method: The method of these four experiments are the same
as the previous FBI tests except that we only measure the hand
temperatures.

As it shows in Figure 4. (a) and (b), we observed the average
temperature decreases only in the synchronous trials. There is a
signiﬁcant temperature difference between Figure 4. (a) and (b) [F
(1,36) = 38.399, P = 0.0001 < 0.1%]. As the results of four different
height mannequins in Figure 4. (a), all the temperature measure-
ments of four heights in the synchronous trials were decreased, and
we set the heights as the main effect can be rejected [F (3,36) =
0.08, P = 0.971 > 5%]. The consequence of these four experiments
we conducted is consistent with the previous research [BGS13].

However, although the factor of mannequin heights had no sig-
niﬁcant effect on the body temperature, we found that the decrease
rate of the body temperature is signiﬁcantly different varying the
different height mannequins. In Figure 4. (c), on the synchronous
trials, the 175cm and the 250cm trials have a large variation from
time 30s to 120s. Thus, we classiﬁed the 175cm and the 250cm tri-
als to be group 1 and the other two heights to be group 2. Then we

P. Xiong, C. Sun & D. Cai / "Synchronize" to VR Body: Full Body Illusion in VR Space

found there is a signiﬁcant difference between two groups [F (1,18)
= 4.89, P = 0.042 < 5%]. Furthermore, as it shows in Figure 4. (d),
on the asynchronous trials, the temperature did not change signiﬁ-
cantly and it can be tolerated as normal skin temperature changes.
On the synchronous trials, the body temperature decreases for each
height are, respectively, 0.42oC, 0.57oC, 0.58oC and 0.39oC. Also,
the temperature decrease amplitude of group 1 is larger than the
group 2 can be observed in Figure 4. (d). And the difference in
body temperature decreases in these two groups with a signiﬁcant
difference level [F (1,38) = 8.10, P = 0.035 < 5%].As the result
shows the temperature changing rate and the temperature decreases
amplitude between these two group are different. Thus, we can say
the group 1 has a stronger feeling of illusory ownership. Also the
175cm height is the average height of the participants, and one of
strongest feeling of illusory ownership was evoked in this height.
Therefore, the authenticity of virtual mannequin heights can affect
the strength of illusory ownership.

Figure 4: The average temperature decreases between the (a) syn-
chronous and (b) asynchronous trials. (c) The temperature chang-
ing rate of 4 heights under synchronous trials. (d) the amplitude
of body temperature decreases between synchronous and asyn-
chronous trials.

5. Conclusions

Illusory ownership is evoked in VR space by using HMD. The
evoked FBI can be measured by using the body temperature de-
creases. The FBI can only be evoked in 1pp tests. We consider the
evocation conditions of RHI and FBI are identical, and they can be
summarized into three conditions as follows:

1. Human body must receive both the synchronized visual and

somatosensory signals in temporal coincidence;

2. The visual signal must be the ﬁrst person perceptive (1pp);

3. The subject and the virtual body needs to be the same height

as much as possible.

The FBI can or may strongly induce or enhance the strong sense
of unity with the virtual characters or avatars in VR spaces. The
FBI can be used for teleoperation of avatar robots and can enhance
the immersive feeling in VR spaces such as those in 4D cinemas.
Manipulation of robots with different sizes is one of the unresolved
problems, and FBI may help to resolve this problem. However, fur-
ther researches are necessary to answer these questions. Also we
will conduct some case studies to help the VR to be more comfort-
able for the sensitive users and collaborate with other ﬁelds (neu-
roscience e.g.) by using openBCI device to ﬁnd out the impact on
long-term VR users in the future work.
