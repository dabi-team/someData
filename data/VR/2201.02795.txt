Abstract Immersive Colonography allows medical pro-
fessionals to navigate inside the intricate tubular geome-
tries of subject-speciﬁc 3D colon images using Virtual
Reality displays. Typically, camera travel is performed
via Fly-Through or Fly-Over techniques that enable
semi-automatic traveling through a constrained, well-
deﬁned path at user-controlled speeds. However, Fly-
Through is known to limit the visibility of lesions located
behind or inside haustral folds. At the same time, Fly-
Over requires splitting the entire colon visualization into
two speciﬁc halves. In this paper, we study the eﬀect
of immersive Fly-Through and Fly-Over techniques on
lesion detection and introduce a camera travel technique
that maintains a ﬁxed camera orientation throughout
the entire medial axis path. While these techniques have
been studied in non-VR desktop environments, their
performance is not well understood in VR setups. We
performed a comparative study to ascertain which cam-
era travel technique is more appropriate for constrained
path navigation in Immersive Colonography and vali-
dated our conclusions with two radiologists. To this end,
we asked 18 participants to navigate inside a 3D colon
to ﬁnd speciﬁc marks. Our results suggest that the Fly-
Over technique may lead to enhanced lesion detection at
the cost of higher task completion times. Nevertheless,
the Fly-Through method may oﬀer a more balanced
trade-oﬀ between speed and eﬀectiveness, whereas the
ﬁxed camera orientation technique provided seemingly

1 Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
of cancer-related death in the western world, with an
estimated 1.4 million new cases every year worldwide,
half of which end in death [1]. Computed Tomography
Colonography (CTC) is an imaging technique that has
been widely adopted for colonic examination for diag-
nostic purposes. Still, the colon is an organ with several
inﬂections and numerous colonic haustral folds along its
extension, making navigation inside CTC 3D models a
hard task [2].

While analyzing CTC content, radiologists work in
the standard workstation, i.e., desktop, monitor, mouse,
and keyboard. However, using a 2D display to analyze
3D structures can lead to missing information [3]. As
conventional systems rely on 2D input devices and sta-
tionary ﬂat displays, clinicians often struggle to obtain
the desired camera position and orientation, which re-
quires several cumulative rotations, making it hard to
perceive the colon structure in 3D. To visualize such
anatomically complex data, the immersion and freedom
of movement aﬀorded by VR systems bear the promise
to assist clinicians in improving 3D reading, namely
enabling more expedite diagnoses [4].

Travel is considered the most basic and essential
component of the VR experience, which is responsible for
changing the user’s viewpoint position and rotation in a
given direction [5]. Due to the complexity of large virtual
environments, several authors apply travel techniques

that rely on path planning, i.e., path-based or path-
constrained travel. In this family of techniques, the user
follows a previously deﬁned path, where users can still
control speed, viewpoint direction, and local deviation,
so that they can locally explore the virtual environment
[6,7]. Path-based travel can also be done automatically,
where both the path and the movement are predeﬁned
to create a smooth navigation experience. Such features
are welcome for virtual endoscopy applications [8, 9, 10].
Given the complexity of the colon’s structure, travel
follows a semi-automatic procedure that relies on center-
line estimation to constrain the direction of movement.
Still, users can control speed. The most conventional
way of CTC travel consists of the Fly-Through technique
[11], where camera orientation follows the centerline’s
direction. Nonetheless, VR could enable more natural
means of travel by decoupling camera orientation from
the direction of movement, in the sense that relative
orientation can diﬀer from the centerline’s direction.
That is the case of the Fly-Over technique, where rel-
ative orientation is perpendicular to the centerline’s
direction [12]. Although these techniques are commonly
used in conventional setups, they have yet to be thor-
oughly investigated in VR settings. Our work focuses on
camera travel as a critical component of surveying and
identifying pathological features in CTC datasets. The
semi-automatic nature of the process, combined with
the abrupt direction changes caused by the complexity
of the colon’s structure, may cause unwanted side-eﬀects
due to the diﬀerence between camera orientation in the
virtual world and the user’s real orientation [13]. We
propose an Elevator technique to overcome this issue,
where camera orientation changes to match the user’s
actual orientation. Using an immersive colonoscopy pro-
totype [14] we studied camera control techniques and
their eﬀectiveness on comprehensive landmark identiﬁ-
cation in order to address the following question: Which
of the considered travel techniques is the most suitable to
navigate inside the 3D reconstructed model of the colon?

2 Related Work

Navigation inside colon structures is a non-trivial and
challenging task task to perform. The Fly-Through tech-
nique has been widely adopted since it was ﬁrst pro-
posed by Lichan Hong [11]. Radiologists prefer this
type of visualization due to its similarities with con-
ventional colonoscopy, which includes dealing with the
same limitations. While moving in a given direction, le-
sion visibility is limited to the colorectal tissue exposed
to the normal of the viewing camera, which may lead
to missing signiﬁcant lesions. In order to address this
and reduce redundancy, colorectal ﬂattening proposed

mapping the colon’s cylindrical surface to a rectangular
plane to create a complete virtual view of the colon [15].
Nonetheless, ﬂattening algorithms are prone to error
and require additional training to understand such 2D
representation of the colon [16]. The unfolded cube pro-
jection proposed projecting all views of the colon on the
inside of a cube using six camera normals that move to-
gether along the centerline [17]. Even though unfolding
the cube enhances lesion visibility, scanning all sides is a
time-consuming task. Fly-Over is another visualization
technique that tries to solve Fly-Through’s limitations.
In this case, the colon is divided into two unique halves
by the centerline, each with a virtual camera [12]. This
method enables perpendicular perspective, producing
increased surface coverage (99% of surface visibility in
one direction vs. 93% in Fly-Through in two naviga-
tion directions) and equally good sensitivity. Despite
the Fly-Over’s positive impact, current CTC software,
such as the V3D-Colon1, syngo.CT Colonography2 only
include Fly-Through, ﬂattening, and the unfolded cube
visualization techniques since the use of the Fly-Over
is restricted for patent reasons. Still, these techniques
suﬀer from using a conventional 2D interface to interact
with a 3D model.

Since its inception, Virtual Reality (VR) has found
applications across the medical domain, namely in med-
ical education [18], surgical planning and training tasks
[19,20,21]. More recently, VR has also been applied to
diagnosis [22,23,24], where being able to sift through
large and complex image datasets is crucial to produc-
ing insightful and complete results. Thus, controlling
viewing position and orientation in expedited yet pre-
cise manners could potentially aﬀect signiﬁcant medical
decisions.

Diﬀerently from commonly used locomotion tech-
niques that often employ ﬂoor-constrained or 6DoF
travel metaphors [25], locomotion in tubular anatomi-
cal structures requires constrained navigation through
a pre-computed path [26,27, 28]. Navigating inside the
human body has been previously studied in a variety
of diﬀerent procedures, such as bronchoscopy [29] and
angioscopy [30]. Such procedures rely on constraining
the locomotion mainly along the center-axis of the gen-
erated 3D model, with varying forms of camera orienta-
tion. These structures are very complex and often need
the path to be computed interactively [29,30], which
makes the path-planning procedure more critical than
the travel technique used. Colon structures, on the other
hand, are not as ramiﬁed but contain haustral folds and
inﬂections that abruptly change the direction of move-
ment while traveling [31], which can promote unwanted

side-eﬀects, such as cybersickness and disorientation. As
a result, this could highly hinder physicians chances of
making the correct diagnosis in an eﬃcient and eﬀective
way [32,33].

Considering the advantages of VR to diagnostic
imaging, especially improved camera control, freedom
of movement, 3D perception, and enhanced scale, two
groups started to explore the immersive CTC experi-
ence. First, Mirhosseini et al. investigated a CAVE (Cave
Automatic Virtual Environment) in which the gastroin-
testinal walls were projected onto the room walls [3].
Despite suggesting potential improvement in reducing
examination time and enhancing accuracy, this type of
setup would be unrealistic in a natural clinical setting.
More recently, Mirhosseini et al. proposed an immersive
CTC system that leverages VR’s advantages to improve
lesion detection [34] while still relying on 2D interac-
tion techniques. Similarly, Randall et al. explored an
immersive VR prototype, obtaining encouraging feed-
back regarding overall faster diagnosis [35]. However,
none of these works focus on camera travel, or explore
a technique other than Fly-Through.

3 Immersive Navigation of a 3D Virtual Colon

We developed an interactive VR system to assist 3D
immersive navigation of subject-speciﬁc colon models
enabling travel via Fly-Through, Fly-Over or Elevator
camera modes [14].

3.1 3D Data

We used a single CTC dataset from The Cancer Imaging
Archive [36] (subject ID CTC-3105759107 ) and recon-
structed the 3D model using a freeware image-based
geometric modeling pipeline [37] (Figure 1).

The high contrast between luminal space (air: black)
and colon luminal surface (colon wall: light grey) facili-
tates 3D reconstruction (Figure 1(A)). Firstly, the 3D

colon structure is segmented using the active contours
method based on region competition (Figure 1(B-C)),
which depends on the intensity values estimated via a
global threshold ﬁlter (ITK-SNAP 3.6). Secondly, a 3-D
surface mesh of the segmented data is generated using
marching cubes. Thirdly, undesired mesh artifacts were
attenuated through a cycle of smoothing and decimating
operations (ParaView 5.3.0) and exported into a *.ply
(ASCII) ﬁle. Finally, the mesh ﬁle was converted to *.obj
(Blender 2.78) and imported into Unity. To compute the
3D centerline of the colon mesh, we used the algorithm
proposed by Tagliasacchi et al. [38] which solves the
3D mesh skeletonization problem by resorting on mean
curvature ﬂow (Figure 1(D)).

3.2 Interaction Design

Following conventional CTC practices, users are placed
inside the colon and navigate from the rectum towards
the cecum and vice-versa. All travel techniques follow
a predeﬁned centerline, i.e., follow the same path and
use the same input (touchpad) to indicate the direc-
tion of movement (forward or backwards) at a constant
speed (Figure 2). By default, the user is anchored to
the centerline to avoid unwanted intersections against
the colon walls, while they can freely move their heads
and/or body to look around and behind the virtual
colon’s tubular structure. However, users can opt to
step away from the centerline by physically walking
towards the colon wall and reach the lumen limits to
better examine local features. After exploring the colon
wall, users can reposition themselves by moving back
towards the centerline. To assist navigation, two arrows
pointing in opposite directions are placed in front of
(green: antegrade) and behind (red: retrograde) the user
accompanying the centerline (Figure 3).

Navigational and diagnostic tools are managed through

HTC Vive controllers (Figure 2). A menu appears every
time the touchpad is activated and tools are displayed by

pressing the corresponding widget buttons. In this work,
only the dominant hand controller was used to handle
both the direction of movement and tagging tasks.

3.3 Immersive Camera Travel Techniques

We considered three camera travel techniques which
allowed users to inspect the colon model and navigate
inside the luminal space: Fly-Through, Fly-Over and
Elevator.

Each technique diﬀers on how the user’s orientation
is represented within the virtual environment. Identical
to conventional CTC, the Fly-Through will make the
user feel inside a cave. In this technique, the virtual
camera follows the path without the need for users to
move their head. They can, however, move their heads
to see what is behind, below or above them. User orien-
tation follows the centerline’s direction, facing the center
of the colon throughout the tortuous tubular structure
(Figure 4(a)). Diﬀerently from the traditional Fly-Over
technique found in the literature [12] there is no need to
split the colon in two halves and assign a virtual camera
to each part. In this case, the inspection of the colon’s
walls is done by users’ head movement. The camera
will automatically keep the perpendicular perspective
in the eyes of the users,
facing the colon’s wall, while
they can move their heads to analyze their surround-
ings as they move along the centerline (Figure 4(b)).
Finally, the Elevator technique does not change camera
orientation, in order to match the user’s real orienta-
tion (Figure 4(c)). In this sense, the user will be facing
the walls in ascending and descending segments of the
colon, only facing the center of the colon whenever the
centerline’s orientation meets the user’s real orientation.
Ultimately, this could reduce cybersickness during the
VR trip, at the cost of increasing users’ chances of losing
the sense of direction.

4 Evaluation

We compared three diﬀerent camera travel techniques
in order to investigate their potential eﬀects on eﬃ-
ciency and diagnosis accuracy during CTC navigation:
Fly-Over, Fly-Through and Elevator. We used both
quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess the ease
of use, usefulness, eﬃciency and eﬃcacy of each tech-
nique. Eﬃciency was measured based on task completion
time, as eﬃcacy corresponded to the success rate, i.e.
the percentage of speciﬁc marks that were correctly
identiﬁed. Through questionnaires (see Appendix) we
assessed the subjective feeling of usefulness, ease of use
and disorientation of all three techniques, as well as
cybersickness [39].

In addition, we conducted a semi-structured inter-
view with two senior radiologists, in order to gain in-
sights into the most relevant aspects in the diagnostic

task, namely the impact of the accuracy rate and the
task completion time in choosing a technique.

4.1 Apparatus

Our setup relies on an oﬀ-the-shelf HTC Vive device.
It consists of a binocular Head-Mounted Display, two
game controllers and a Lighthouse Tracking System
composed by two cameras with emitting pulsed infrared
lasers that track all six degrees-of-freedom of head and
handheld gear (Figure 5). The tracking system gener-
ates an acquisition volume that enables users to move
freely within a 4.5x4.5x2.5 m3 space. We performed
user tests using an Asus ROG G752VS Laptop with
an Intel®Core™ i7-6820HK Processor, 64GB RAM and
NVIDIA GeForce GTX1070. The VR prototype runs
at 60 frames per second. All the code was developed in
C# using the SteamVR Plugin and Unity game engine
(version 5.5.1f1).

4.2 Participants

Eighteen participants (13 male, 5 female) took part in
our study, with ages between 18 and 25 years old (Mean
= 21.94; Standard Deviation = 1.98). Most participants
had an engineering background, namely Computer Sci-
ence (38.89%) and Biomedical Engineering (27.78%).
Most reported no previous experience in VR (66.6%) or
to use such systems less than once a month (27.78%).
One user reported to have claustrophobia.

followed by performing a training task with the tech-
nique they were assigned, to familiarize themselves both
with the technique and the virtual environment. Af-
ter that, they performed the test task followed by a
post-test questionnaire using a six-point Likert scale
to assess qualitative metrics, and a Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire (SSQ) to assess cybersickness. The task
consisted in ﬁnding speciﬁc marks, in the form of orange
3cm capsules (Figure 6), which were placed in both
easy and hard to ﬁnd locations in the colon, to simulate
the visibility of real lesions. Users were oblivious to the
total amount of marks (20 marks per technique) spread
throughout the colon. Instead, they were asked to ﬁnd
as many as they could, until they felt they had found
them all. This procedure was repeated for all three tech-
niques, which were assigned according to a balanced
latin-squares arrangement to avoid learning eﬀects.

4.4 Radiologists’ Qualitative Assessment

We conducted a semi-structured interview with two se-
nior radiologists with 15 and 20 years of experience,
both female and members of a multidisciplinary gas-
trointestinal oncology team. While both are familiar
with CTC, only one performs CTC regularly, while the
other only uses CTC for speciﬁc medical cases. Due to
pandemic restrictions, a single researcher conducted a
remote session with both participants, in which both
could freely share their opinions on the subject matter.
The session was video recorded and transcribed for data
analysis.

Fig. 7 Success Rate for each condition: Fly-Through, Fly-
Over and Elevator.* indicates statistical signiﬁcance.

For task completion time, success rate and SSQ
scores, a Shapiro-Wilk test revealed that the data were
not normally distributed. We thus applied a Fried-
man non-parametric test for multiple comparisons and
Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks post-hoc tests with a Bonferroni
correction, setting a signiﬁcance level at p ≤ 0.017. We
also applied these tests to Likert-scale data collected
via questionnaires and cybersickness scores.

There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the success rate
values depending on the technique used, χ2(2) = 7.600,
p = 0.022. Median (Interquartile Range) values for suc-
cess rate using the Fly-Through, Fly-Over and Eleva-
tor techniques were 79.47 (26.25), 89.47 (18.42) and
76.84 (36.77), respectively (Figure 7). Post-hoc anal-
ysis showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase of the
success rate between the Elevator and the Fly-Over
technique (Z = −2.386, p = 0.017). However, there were
no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the Fly-
Through and Fly-Over techniques (Z = −2.345, p =
0.019), nor between the Fly-Through and the Elevator
(Z = −0.734, p = 0.463).

Regarding task completion time, we found signiﬁcant
diﬀerences depending on the technique used, χ2(2) =
10.333, p = 0.006. Mean (standard deviation) task com-
pletion time values for the Fly-Through, Fly-Over and
Elevator techniques were 273.91 (100.05), 305.53 (124.38)
and 322.13 (135.49), respectively (Figure 8). Post-hoc

analysis showed statistically signiﬁcant decreases be-
tween Fly-Through and Fly-Over (Z = −2.548, p =
0.011), as well as between the Fly-Through and the El-
evator techniques (Z = −2.548, p = 0.011). Still, there
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the Fly-Over and
the Elevator (Z = −1.328, p = 0.184). We also did not
ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences between techniques regarding
SSQ scores, χ2(2) = 4.875, p = 0.087 (Figure 9).

As for qualitative metrics (Table 1), we found sta-
tistical signiﬁcance in the perceived usefulness of the
navigation technique (Q1) (χ2(2) = 7.35 p = 0.025).

Notably, users found Fly-Through more useful than
the Fly-Over technique (Z = −2.588 p = 0.01). We
also found statistical signiﬁcance regarding the ease of
understanding the direction of movement (Q2) (χ2(2) =
9.529 p = 0.009), but with no signiﬁcance between pairs
after performing a Bonferroni correction. Finally, results
indicate statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in perceived
disorientation (χ2(2) = 11.111 p = 0.004). In eﬀect,
users felt less disoriented by the Fly-Through technique
as compared either to Elevator (Z = −2.541 p = 0.011)
or Fly-Over (Z = −2.634 p = 0.008) methods.

troenterologists (who perform optical colonoscopies). We
have to locate and measure polyps, so we are able to
decide whether it is something too small, which needs to
be watched over time, or if it is something that needs to
be removed right away. That’s the exam’s main goal ”.

When asked to characterize visualization challenges
during endo-luminal navigation, radiologists agreed the
colon is a complex structure with many anatomical bar-
riers which directly impact the diagnostic task. In this
sense, they mentioned that “The colon is a tortuous
structure, which makes it diﬃcult for the machines to
fully capture the intestinal walls. This includes haustral
folds, inﬂections and the colon as a tortuous structure
by itself.” The haustral folds in particular, require ra-
diologists to navigate forward and backwards, in both
prone and supine positions: “In this type of exam, we
start by ascending from the rectum to the cecum, and
then coming from the cecum back to the rectum to try to
see both sides of the folds. This is part of the protocol,
we do it both for the images obtained in prone (lying face
down) and supine (lying face up) position. We try to
see it in both directions to lessen the probability of miss-
ing something”. Radiologists also pointed out ”There
is another type of pathology that results in a certain
degree of inﬂammation of the colon, which is aﬀected
by diverticula and a lower bowel distension. This makes
it harder to detect small polyps or any anomalies on
the colon’s wall, and to diﬀerentiate the type of lesions
found. Also, there are dirtier areas where bowel cleans-
ing is not as eﬀective, such as the right colon. Often,
exams are not conclusive because people still have fecal
matter inside their colon”.

Finally, radiologists were asked about their percep-
tions on the importance of the accuracy rate and task
completion time on diagnostic tasks. Firstly, they shared
their considerations on task completion time: ”Time is
surely a relevant factor, it has become more and more
important. After acquiring CTC data, we perform our
diagnostic task at the workstation. We need to navigate
the colon and if we ﬁnd any lesions, we need to mea-
sure them and mark them. This never takes less than 15
minutes, even for an experienced radiologist”. Still, they
perceive accuracy rate as more relevant, not only for
their performance, but also for patients’ health. As they
put it “I believe the accuracy rate is more important,
isn’t it? As long as the technique is accurate and enables
us to perform the medical diagnosis, it can be more time
consuming. If it was faster, it would be better, but we
will use it anyway. We will not discard it for that”. Also,
professionals highlighted the importance of the accuracy
rate by saying that “In any exam, the main goal is to
achieve a full pathology detection and achieve the highest
accuracy rate, close to 100%. We also know that it is

hard, not just with CTC, but also conventional optical
colonoscopy. I can’t recall the current accuracy rate of
CTC performed in a clean colon, in an exam that is
considered well done, but it is very close to the other
(optical colonoscopy). Sure that if we miss any lesions,
we also miss the opportunity of removing them and it
may be the case they eventually transform into a can-
cerous lesion. On the other hand, if we believe that we
detected a cancerous lesion, which turns out to be a false
lesion, and not a polypoid lesion, then we will be sending
the patient to undergo optical colonoscopy to potentially
locate and remove the polypoid lesion in a more invasive
procedure. That can happen in any exam! ”.

6 Discussion

We have presented a study on three diﬀerent techniques
for locomotion in VR Colonoscopy using head-mounted
displays. While ﬂy-through and ﬂy-over have been pre-
viously studied in desktop applications, we introduced
a third novel technique (elevator) and compared the
three via empirical tests with novice users. Overall, Fly-
Through has proven to be the best technique for im-
mersive colonoscopy navigation in the user tests we
conducted. Indeed, we found it to be the most eﬃcient
option, according to task completion times, besides be-
ing considered the most useful (Q1), easy to use (Q2)
and less disorienting (Q3) by the subjects. Even though
Fly-Over seemingly produced higher success rates, there
were no statistical diﬀerences that could support its use
over the Fly-Through, since the signiﬁcant increase in
task completion times would likely oﬀset those gains.
However, from a medical perspective, signiﬁcant im-
provements in accuracy would outweigh longer task
completion times, which would justify investigating this
technique further.

Additionally, users reported higher disorientation
while using the Fly-Over technique. Such results may be
attributed to the fact that Fly-Over had subjects facing
the colon walls most of the time. Orienting the camera
at a direction perpendicular to displacement severely
hampered their general perception of the tubular struc-
ture of the colon and the path they were following. This,
combined with marks located behind their backs, which
forced subjects to inspect the structure in several di-
rections to try and ﬁnd them, ultimately caused their
disorientation. Such results suggest that the Fly-Over
technique may be improved by devising new means and
interaction techniques for clinicians to visualize struc-

navigation. Finally, the Elevator technique was the least
favored option for navigating the virtual environment.
This may be due to the search strategy adopted by
most, which had to change after each abrupt movement
caused by the natural inﬂections of the colon’s structure.
That may also explain why this technique turned out to
be the least eﬃcient when compared to the other two
approaches, as users required more time to adapt and
adjust their orientation whenever the camera direction
changed. Surprisingly, we could not ﬁnd signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in terms of cybersickness reported by subjects.

face modalities to improve diagnostic and generalize our
results to more cave- and tunnel-like structures.

7 Conclusions

Conﬂict of interest

In this paper, we study Fly-Through and Fly-Over tech-
niques in immersive VR CTC, in terms of eﬃciency, ease
of use, usefulness and eﬀectiveness. We also compared
these to the Elevator, a novel technique in this domain
that combines both approaches to make virtual orienta-
tion match the user’s direction of movement throughout
navigation. Our results show that Fly-Through is still
the most eﬃcient and easy to use technique for immer-
sive VR CTC. We found the Elevator technique to be
less eﬀective and eﬃcient than both Fly-Through and
Fly-Over methods, but less disorienting than the Fly-
Over approach. This can be explained by the need to
physically turn one’s body to eﬀectively scan the colon
structure in all directions. Still, this limitation did not
aﬀect task eﬀectiveness, as in the Fly-Over technique
users could achieve higher success rates when ﬁnding
speciﬁc marks along the colonic structure. Thus, the
Fly-Over would be the technique of choice in order to
provide a more accurate analysis, and produce enhanced
readings, as it helps people to identify lesions even in
diﬃcult-to-scan locations despite being a more time-
consuming procedure. Indeed our experience suggests
that each interaction technique could be useful in its
own right, Fly-Through being most adequate to scan the
colon in a quick preview, while Fly-Over would likely
enable more reliable and comprehensive readings by clin-
icians, which would potentially make it their technique
of choice.

Still, our study had two main limitations. First, our
experimental task only aimed at reﬂecting the real clini-
cal task to a certain extent, i.e., limited lesion visibility
caused by the anatomical properties of the colon, while
orange capsules may signiﬁcantly diﬀer from lesions
such as polyps. Second, our participants had no clini-
cal background, which may impact the selection of the
ideal navigation technique to perform immersive VR
CTC analysis. Future work will include validating such
conclusions with medical professionals and using more
