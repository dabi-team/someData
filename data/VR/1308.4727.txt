ABSTRACT
We use UCAC4 proper motions and WISE W 1-band apparent magnitudes intensity-
mean for almost 400 ﬁeld RR Lyrae variables to determine the parameters of the
velocity distribution of Galactic RR Lyrae population and constrain the zero points of
the metallicity-< MV > relation and those of the period-metallicity-< MKs >-band
and period-metallicity-< MW 1 >-band luminosity relations via statistical parallax.
We ﬁnd the mean velocities of the halo- and thick-disc RR Lyrae populations in
the solar neighbourhood to be (U0(Halo), V0(Halo), W0(Halo)) = (−7 ± 9, −214 ±
10, −10 ± 6) km s−1 and (U0(Disc), V0(Disc), W0(Disc)) = (−13 ± 7, −37 ± 6, −17 ±4)
km s−1, respectively, and the corresponding components of the velocity-dispersion
ellipsoids, (σVR(Halo), σVφ(Halo), σVθ(Halo)) = (153 ± 9, 101 ± 6, 96 ± 5) km s−1
and (σVR(Disc), σVφ(Disc), σVθ(Disc)) = (46 ± 7, 37 ± 5, 27 ± 4) km s−1, respectively.
The fraction of thick-disc stars is estimated at 0.22 ± 0.03. The corrected IR period-
metallicity-luminosity relations are < MKs > = -0.769 +0.088 · [Fe/H]- 2.33 · log PF
and < MW 1 > = -0.825 + 0.088· [Fe/H] -2.33 · log PF , and the optical metallicity-
luminosity relation, [Fe/H]-< MV >, is < MV > = +1.094 + 0.232· [Fe/H], with a
standard error of ± 0.089, implying an LMC distance modulus of 18.32 ± 0.09, a solar
Galactocentric distance of 7.73 ± 0.36 kpc, and the M31 and M33 distance moduli
of DMM31 = 24.24 ± 0.09 (D = 705 ± 30 kpc) and DMM33 = 24.36 ± 0.09 (D
= 745 ± 31 kpc), respectively. Extragalactic distances calibrated with our RR Lyrae
star luminosity scale imply a Hubble constant of ∼80 km/s/Mpc. Our results suggest
marginal prograde rotation for the population of halo RR Lyraes in the Milky Way.

INTRODUCTION

RR Lyrae variables are A-F type giants undergoing core he-
lium burning, which pulsate with periods 0.2-1.2 d and have
masses and luminosities of M ∼ 0.7M⊙ and L = 40 − 50L⊙,
respectively. They are easy to identify by their periods and
characteristic light-curve shapes and, like other pulsating
stars, obey a period-metallicity-luminosity relation, which
in the case of the V - and K- bands appears to degener-
ate into the metallicity-luminosity and period-luminosity
relations, respectively (Catelan et al. 2004), both charac-
terised by a very low intrinsic scatter of 6 0.06 − 0.09m
(Wagner-Kaiser & Sarajedini 2013; Frolov & Samus 1998).
Because of the large ages (> 10 Gyr) of RR Lyrae variables
these stars occur in systems with old populations (globular
clusters, elliptical galaxies, halos and thick discs of spiral
galaxies, irregular galaxies) and can therefore serve as dis-
tance indicators, as well as kinematic and metallicity trac-

ers. Although their factor of ∼ 100 lower luminosities have
long left RR Lyraes somewhat overshadowed by Cepheids
as extragalactic distance indicators, recent progress in ex-
tragalactic stellar photometry has made them an eﬃcient
tool for mapping the Local Group, and one of the most im-
portant contributors to the ﬁrst rung of the cosmic distance
scale (Cacciari 2013).

However, for RR Lyraes to be properly usable to this
end, the parameters of the period-metallicity-luminosity re-
lations in various bands have to be established with adequate
precision. The problem is that although a consensus seems
to have emerged concerning the slopes of the corresponding
relations in various photometric bands, this still is far from
true for the respective zero-points: they, like 17 years ago,
”continue to defy a consensus” (Layden et al. 1996) with es-
timates reported by diﬀerent authors spanning a ∼ 0.3-0.5m
wide interval.

Six decades ago, Pavlovskaya (1953) was the ﬁrst to

apply the statistical-parallax technique to estimate the
mean absolute magnitude of RR Lyrae stars. Since then,
the method, continuously reﬁned, has been used exten-
sively by many authors (Pavlovskaya 1953; Rigal 1958;
van Herk 1965; Clube & Dawe 1980; Hawley et al. 1986;
Strugnell 1986; Layden et al. 1996; Popowski & Gould
1998a,b; Gould & Popowski 1998; Fernley et al. 1998a;
Tsujimoto 1998; Luri et al. 1998; Dambis & Rastorguev
2004;
2001;
Rastorguev, Dambis & Zabolotskikh 2005; Dambis 2009;
Kollmeier et al. 2012) with ever increasing samples of RR
Lyrae stars. The current, maximum-likelihood version of
the technique was ﬁrst proposed by Murray (1983), and
its practical application dates back to Strugnell (1986) and
Hawley et al. (1986). Layden et al. (1996) were the ﬁrst to
take into account the kinematic inhomogeneity of the local
RR Lyrae population by a priori attributing each star either
to the halo or thick-disc subsample based on metallicity
and velocity data. Luri et al. (1996) generalised the method
to explicitly incorporate the eventual multicomponent
structure of the population studied, and Luri et al. (1998)
applied the generalised technique to Galactic RR Lyrae
type stars. One of the solutions in our previous study
(Dambis 2009) also took into account the bimodal nature
of the velocity distribution without a priori partitioning the
sample into two groups.

Time has now come for yet another statistical-parallax
based study of RR Lyrae type stars to be performed
for two main reasons. First, impressive progress has been
achieved in the photometry of RR Lyrae variables, with
good light curves obtained for many stars. These include
(a) extensive optical data acquired both within the frame-
work of ASAS survey (Pojmanski 2002) and as a result of
our dedicated program of photometric observations of RR
Lyrae stars (Berdnikov et al. 2011a,b, 2012), and (b) in-
frared light curves acquired within the framework of WISE
all-sky photometric survey (Wright et al. 2010) supple-
mented by single-phase 2MASS JHKs-band measurements
(Cutri et al. 2003), which, given precise light elements, can
be converted to the corresponding intensity-mean magni-
tudes (Feast et al. 2008). As a result, bona ﬁde multicolour
intensity-mean magnitudes have for the ﬁrst time become
available simultaneously for the bulk of ∼ 400 Galactic ﬁeld
RR Lyrae type variables with known radial velocities and
metallicities, allowing the interstellar extinction to be ac-
curately determined for all these objects. Second, the re-
lease of the ﬁnal, fourth version of The US Naval Observa-
tory CCD Astrograph Catalogue (UCAC4)(Zacharias et al.
2013), which provides very accurate proper motions for most
of the stars down to an R-band limiting magnitude of about
16m, allows the statistical-parallax study to be based on a
single source of proper motions throughout the entire sky.

The primary aim of this paper is to reﬁne the infrared
and visual photometric distance scales of RR Lyrae variables
by further constraining the zero points of the V -, Ks-, and
WISE W 1-band period-metallicity-colour relations for these
stars via the method of statistical parallax, and use them to
estimate the distances to a number of Local group galaxies.
As a by product, we calibrate the (V − Ks)0 and (V − W 1)0
intrinsic colours of these stars and determine the kinematical
parameters of the local RR Lyrae star population.

Section 2 describes the observational data that we use

for our statistical-parallax analysis. In Section 3 we analyze
the interstellar extinction toward our sample stars and de-
rive the intrinsic-colour relations for RR Lyrae type stars
in terms of fundamental period and metallicity. Section 4
is devoted to the initial (provisional) distances to our sam-
ple RR Lyraes to be adjusted. In Section 5 we say a few
words about the statistical-parallax method employed and
the (kinematical and distance-scale) parameters to be deter-
mined. In Section 6 we present the results of our analysis.
In Sections 7, 8, and 9 we discuss the implications of our
results for the cosmic distance scale, rotation of RR Lyrae
populations, and cosmology, respectively. The ﬁnal section
summarizes the conclusions.

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA

First, we tried to collect the most complete possible sample
of Galactic ﬁeld RR Lyrae type variables with measured ra-
dial velocities and metallicities. The sample we use in this
paper is based mostly on that employed in our previous
statistical-parallax analysis of RR Lyrae variables (Dambis
2009), which, in turn, is based on the list of Galactic RR
Lyraes from the revised catalogue of 2106 Galactic stars
selected without kinematic bias and with available radial
velocities, distance estimates, and metal abundances in the
range -4.06[Fe/H]60.0 compiled by Beers et al. (2000). This
list includes a total of 388 Galactic RR Lyrae stars, which we
supplement with the data for 14 additional RR Lyrae type
variables from recent papers. Thus our ﬁnal sample contains
402 RR Lyrae type stars.

2.1 Periods and pulsation modes

Like in our previous study (Dambis 2009), we adopt the peri-
ods of the RR Lyrae type stars of our sample from the ASAS
catalogue (Pojmanski 2002), Maintz (2005), or the General
Catalogue of Variable Stars (Samus et al. 2013). The latter
was our source of pulsation modes. We use the formula PF
= log P + 0.127 (Frolov & Samus 1998) to fundamentalise
the periods of RRc type variables (ﬁrst-overtone pulsators).

2.2 Apparent intensity-mean magnitudes

2.2.1 V -band data

Layden et al. (1996) characterised the available V -band
photometry for Galactic ﬁeld RR Lyrae variables as a ”sur-
prisingly heterogeneous data set”, and this is still true after
17 years, although extensive optical data has been acquired
since then as a result of ASAS survey (Pojmanski 2002)
and our own dedicated program (Berdnikov et al. 2011a,b,
2012). In this paper, we derive the intensity-mean John-
son V -band magnitudes < V > based on nine suﬃciently
large overlapping sets of photoelectric and CCD observa-
tions (Bookmeyer et al. (1977) (1), ASAS (Pojmanski 2002)
(2), HIPPARCOS Hp-band photometry (ESA 1997) (3),
Lub (1977); van Genderen et al. (1980) (4), Clube & Dawe
(1980) (5), our own data Berdnikov et al. (2011a,b, 2012)
(6), Schmidt (1991); Schmidt et al. (1995); Schmidt & Seth
(1996) (7), Layden (1994, 1997); Day et al. (2002) (8),
Kinman (1961, 1982, 2002); Kinman & Brown (2010) (9)).

In the case of the data of Bookmeyer et al. (1977) and
Clube & Dawe (1980) we computed the initial
intensity
means < V > using Eq. (1) from Layden (1994). We
adopted the initial intensity-mean < V > magnitudes based
on HIPPARCOS Hp-band photometry from Fernley et al.
(1998a) or computed them in accordance with the pro-
cedure described by the above authors for stars lacking
in their paper. In the case of observations made in the
ﬁve-colour Walraven system we adopted the Johnson mag-
nitude means < V >m listed by Lub (1977) and com-
puted the corresponding magnitude means based on the
data reported by van Genderen et al. (1980). In the case
of ASAS data we determined the intensity means < V >
from the light-curve ﬁts deﬁned by the Fourier coeﬃcients
reported by Szczygie l et al. (2009) or computed them di-
rectly from ASAS data for the stars lacking in the list of
Szczygie l et al. (2009). We thus have a set of mean magni-
tudes < Vik > for our stars, where i and j are the number
of the dataset and the number of the star, respectively. As
mentioned above, < Vik > is the initial intensity-mean mag-
nitude estimate, except for the case of dataset i=4 (Lub
1977; van Genderen et al. 1980), which consists of magni-
tude means. We then determine the homogeneous intensity-
mean < Vk >f inal magnitudes for our stars and the correct-
ing oﬀsets ∆Vi by solving the following set of linear equa-
tions:

< Vk >f inal −∆Vi =< Vik >

(1)

We adopt the dataset of Bookmeyer et al. (1977) as our
standard system and set ∆V1 = 0 by deﬁnition. We col-
lected a total of 905 mean magnitude estimates for 384 stars
and hence have 905 equations for 384+8=392 unknowns.
The resulting oﬀsets ∆Vi are listed in column 4 of Table 1.
Other columns list the number of the dataset (column 1),
the references to the original data (column 2), the num-
ber of stars in the dataset (column 3), and remarks (col-
umn 5). The standard errors of the homogenised intensity-
mean magnitudes < Vk >f inal range from ∼ 0.015m to
∼ 0.035m. The oﬀsets can be seen to be generally small,
and only in three cases do they appreciably exceed 0.01m
in absolute value: these correspond to datasets (4) (Lub
1977; van Genderen et al. 1980), (5) (Clube & Dawe 1980),
and (7)(Schmidt 1991; Schmidt et al. 1995; Schmidt & Seth
1996). To reveal eventual metallicity-dependent systemat-
ics, we computed the intensity-mean magnitude diﬀerences
< Vik > − < V2,k > between each dataset and the largest
dataset (2) (ASAS) and ﬁtted them to a linear relation of
the form

< Vik > − < V2,k >= pi + qi · [F e/H].

(2)

We found, as expected, the resulting metallicity slopes qi not
to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from zero and range from -0.002 ±0.023
to +0.020 ± 0.046 for all datasets except no. 8 (Layden 1994,
1997; Day et al. 2002):

< V8 > − < VASAS >=

+ 0.104 ± 0.045 + (0.063 ± 0.031) · [F e/H].

(3)

However, even in this case the slope barely exceeds 2σ
and is actually due to three clear outliers at the high-
metallicity end (see Fig. 1). Note that two of these stars —
UY Aps (b = −11.39) and V494 Sco (b = −0.49) — are lo-
cated in crowded ﬁelds close to the Galactic equator, where

ASAS performance is degraded because of the large pixel
size (∼ 15 arcsec2). We therefore homogenize V -intensity
magnitudes without introducing any metallicity dependent
terms.

2.2.2 Ks-band data

As we already pointed out (Dambis 2009), the 2MASS
project, which mapped the entire sky in three near-infrared
bands – J, H, and Ks, provides homogeneous near-infrared
photometry for almost all Galactic RR Lyrae type variables
with known metallicities and radial velocities. Another im-
portant advantage of 2MASS data over available optical
photometry is its highly reduced sensitivity to interstellar

extinction, which is one order of magnitude smaller in the Ks
band than in the V band (Yuan et al. 2013). We adopt the
intensity-mean Ks-band magnitudes for most of the stars
of our sample from Dambis (2009). These are single-epoch
2MASS magnitudes phase corrected in accordance with the
procedure described by Feast et al. (2008) (including the
data adopted from Kinman et al. (2007) for 13 stars), which
are accurate to within ∼ 0.03m (summed quadratically with
error of the observed 2MASS Ks magnitude), or just raw

2MASS magnitudes with no phase correction applied (in
the case of no or too outdated ephemeris) for 32 stars.
For the additional 12 stars we determine the intensity-mean
Ks-band magnitudes by phase correcting their 2MASS Ks-
band magnitudes using the same procedure described by
Feast et al. (2008) (for ﬁve stars) or adopting the phase-
corrected 2MASS Ks magnitude from Kinman et al. (2007)
(one star) and Kinman et al. (2012) (six stars). We have
collected intensity-mean Ks-band estimates for all 403 RR
Lyrae type variables of our sample.

2.2.3 WISE W 1-band data

The WISE All-Sky Data Release, which was made pub-
lic last year (Cutri et al. 2012) and which mapped the en-
tire sky in four mid-infrared bands W1, W2, W3, and W4
with the eﬀective wavelengths of 3.368, 4.618, 12.082 and
22.194 µm, respectively (Wright et al. 2010), is even better
suited for building the distance scale of RR Lyrae type vari-
ables. Its chief advantages over 2MASS are the true homo-
geneity (measurements performed over the entire sky with a
single instrument operating beyond the earth atmosphere),
a factor of ∼ 1.7 smaller sensitivity to interstellar extinc-
tion (Yuan et al. 2013), and good phase coverage for short-
period variables with at least a dozen well-distributed mea-
surements available for all stars and over a thousand mea-
surements made for stars near the ecliptic poles. We used the
WISE single-exposure database to compute the intensity-
mean average W1-band magnitudes, < W 1 >, for a total
of 398 stars of our sample. Figure 4 shows the WISE W1
light curves for a TT Lyn, a typical RR Lyrae variable from
our list, and Fig. 5 shows the WISE W1 light curve of VW
Dor, which is located close to the South Ecliptic Pole at the
ecliptic latitude of -89.129◦.

2.4 Radial velocities

We adopted the mean radial velocities, VR, and their
standard errors, σVR, for most of the stars from Dambis
(2009), and the corresponding quantities for
the ad-
from Fernley & Barnes (1997) (BH Aur,
ditional stars,
V363 Cas, and EZ Cep), Jeﬀery et al. (2007) (CH Aql
and BK UMa), Pier et al. (2003) (RW Lyn), Kinman et al.
(2007) (MO Com), Kinman & Brown (2010) (DQ Lyn,
EN Lyn, BN UMa, and CK UMa). We also updated the γ
velocities for seven stars (WY Ant, XZ Aps, BS Aps, Z Mic,
RV Oct, V1645 Sgr, and AS Vir) based on the data reported
by For et al. (2011). We collected the mean radial velocity
estimates for all 403 stars of our sample. Figure 7 shows the
distribution of radial-velocity errors for stars of our sample.

the 403 stars of our list. Figure 8 shows the distribution of
proper-motion errors in right ascension (the top panel) and

2.3 Metallicities

For most of the stars of our sample we use the homogenised
metallicities on the Zinn & West (1984) scale adopted from
the compilation of Dambis (2009), which, in turn, is mostly
based on the catalogue of Beers et al. (2000). All these
metallicities are based on spectroscopic measurements. Our
sources of metallicities for the additional stars lacking in
the sample of Dambis (2009) were Fernley & Barnes (1997)
(BH Aur, V363 Cas, and EZ Cep, reduced to the Zinn
and West scale via formula (46) in Dambis (2009)), Layden
(1994) (ET Hya, , already on the Zinn and West scale),
Pier et al. (2003) (RW Lyn, reduced to the Zinn and West
scale via formula (46) in Dambis (2009)), Kinman et al.
(2007) (MO Com, reduced to the Zinn and West scale via
formula (46) in Dambis (2009)), Kinemuchi et al. (2006)
(EN Lyn, photometric metallicity on the Zinn and West
scale), Kemper (1982) (BK UMa and BN UMa, delta S val-
ues reduced to [Fe/H] on the Zinn and West scale). We com-
puted the photometric metallicities of CH Aql (from ASAS

”extinction at inﬁnity”. This approach should work well for
most of the stars except those located close to the Galac-
tic plane. We consider it better to compute extinction in
terms of the 3D extinction model by Drimmel et al. (2003).
To do this, we need to approximately estimate the distances
to our stars (we show below that choosing another, even
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent published relation, has no eﬀect on
the colour calibrations and extinction estimates obtained
in this section). We begin by estimating the absolute Ks-
band magnitudes of our sample stars by adopting (provi-
sionally) the following period-luminosity relation derived by
Jones et al. (1992) based on the results obtained using the
Baade-Wesselink method:

< MK(J ones) >= −2.33 · log PF − 0.88,

(4)

where K-band magnitudes are on the CIT system.
Given the negligible and statistically insigniﬁcant coeﬃ-
cient of the colour term in the transformation equation
(http://www.astro.caltech.edu/∼jmc/2mass/v3/transformations/)

(Ks)2M ASS = KCIT +

(−0.019 ± 0.004) + (0.001 ± 0.005)(J − K)CIT

(5)

and the fact that average (J − K) colour indices of RR
Lyrae type variables always lie inside the interval from 0.00m
to 0.50m, period-KCIT -band luminosity relation given by
equation (4) transforms into the following period-Ks-band
luminosity relation

< MKs >= −2.33 · log PF − 0.90,

(6)

which we use to compute the absolute Ks-band magni-
tudes of our stars. We then use the 3D extinction model
by Drimmel et al. (2003) to determine the amount of inter-
stellar extinction toward each star via the following itera-
tive procedure. We initially set the total Ks band extinction
equal to zero, AKs=0, and compute the distance (in kpc) by
the following formula:
d = 100.2·(<Ks >−AKs

−MKs )−2.

Figure 8. Distribution of proper-motion errors of sample stars
in right ascension (a) and declination (b).

We use this distance estimate and the star’s coordinates
to compute the reﬁned estimate of the amount of interstel-
lar extinction, AV , in terms of the model of Drimmel et al.
(2003), transform it into E(B − V ) = AV /RV (RV = 3.1
(Yuan et al. 2013)), compute AKs = RK · E(B − V ) (RKs =
AKs /E(B − V ) = 0.306 (Yuan et al. 2013)), and reﬁne the
distance estimate via formula (7). We repeat this procedure
until both d and AKs (and, naturally, E(B − V ), and AV )
converge.

A question naturally arises to which extent are our red-
dening estimates dependent on the adopted provisional dis-
tances to RR Lyrae type stars. To assess the eﬀect of a
diﬀerent set of input distance estimates, we repeated the
above procedure using two other popular period-metallicity-
< MK > relations, which, compared to PL relation (6),
yield brighter absolute magnitudes practically for all our
stars, on the average by ∼ 0.35m, translating into a factor
of ∼ 1.17 longer distances. The one was derived theoretically
by Bono et al. (2003):

< MKs >= −2.101 · log PF + 0.231(± 0.012) · [F e/H]

− 0.770(± 0.044),

(8)

and the other is an empirical one derived by Sollima et al.
(2008) based on observational data for globular-cluster RR
Lyrae variables:

< MKs >= −2.38(± 0.04) · log PF + 0.09(± 0.14) · [F e/H]

− 1.07(± 0.11),

(9)

We found the distances based on the period-metallicity-
< MK > relation of Bono et al. (2003) to yield AV values
that diﬀer by +0.0023±0.0004 with a scatter of 0.009 from
those computed with distances based on relation (6). The
corresponding diﬀerence for the calibration of Sollima et al.
(2008) is +0.0031±0.0006 with a scatter of 0.011. The dif-
ferences become truly negligible for the subsample of stars
with |b| > 25◦, on which our ﬁnal colour calibrations are
actually based (see below): +0.0002±0.0001 with a scatter
of 0.0016 for both the relation of Bono et al. (2003) and that
of Sollima et al. (2008). We can therefore safely assume that
all the colour calibrations derived below do not depend on
the provisional input distances used to estimate the inter-
stellar extinction toward the calibrating RR Lyrae stars of
our sample. Hence the ﬁnal colour calibrations remain un-
changed and so are the extinction values for low-latitude
stars that are based on them. We point out that the pro-
visional distances computed in this section serve the sole
purpose of estimating the interstellar extinction and are not
used below for any other end.

We now use the resulting AV , AKs , and AW 1 = RW 1 ·
E(B−V ) (RW 1 = AW 1/E(B−V ) = 0.18 (Yuan et al. 2013))
values to deredden the observed intensity-mean < V >, <
Ks >, and < W 1 > magnitudes:

< V >0=< V > −AV ,

< Ks >0=< Ks > −AKs,

< W 1 >0=< W 1 > −AW 1,

and the intrinsic colours:

(10)

(11)

(12)

(< V > − < Ks >)0 =< V > − < Ks > −(AV − AKs ), (13)

(< Ks > − < W 1 >)0 =< Ks > − < W 1 > −(AKs−AW 1), (14)

(< V > − < W 1 >)0 =< V > − < W 1 > −(AV −AW 1).(15)

We now calibrate the (< V > − < Ks >)0 intrinsic
colour index in terms of [Fe/H] and log PF . We proceed
based on the following two established facts. First, the ab-
solute V-band magnitude of RR Lyrae variables depends on
metallicity [Fe/H] and, for a given metallicity is independent
of period (Catelan et al. 2004):

< MV >= av + bv · [F e/H],

(16)

where the most recent reliable direct empirical estimates of
the slope bv are bv = 0.214 ± 0.047 (Gratton et al. 2004)
and bv = 0.25 ± 0.02 (Federici et al. 2012). These estimates
are based on the sole geometric assumption that the stars
in question are in both cases at the same distance from us.
Hereafter we adopt the simple (unweighted) average of the
two:

< MV >= av + 0.232(± 0.020) · [F e/H],

(17)

We prefer to rely on the above estimates rather than on
those based on Baade-Wesselink analyses (Cacciari et al.
1992; Skillen et al 1993; Fernley et al. 1998b), which de-
pend on more input assumptions and are therefore not
enough ”empiric”. However, we point out that the corre-
sponding slope estimates agree well with those mentioned
above: bv = 0.20 (Cacciari et al. 1992), bv = 0.21 ± 0.05
(Skillen et al 1993), and bv = 0.20 ± 0.04 (Fernley et al.

Lyrae variables depends on fundamentalised pulsation pe-
riod, PF , and, possibly, metallicity

< MKs >= ak + bk · [F e/H] + ck · logPF ,

(18)

with the logPF slope of ck = -2.33 (Jones et al. 1992;
Frolov & Samus 1998; Catelan et al. 2004), i.e.:

< MKs >= ak + bk · [F e/H] − 2.33 · logPF .

(19)

We subtract equation (19) from equation (16) to obtain:

(< V > − < Ks >)0 =< MV > − < MKs >=

= (av − ak) + (bv − bk) · [F e/H] + 2.33 · logPF .

(20)

We denote avk = av − ak and bvk = bv − bk to rewrite the
above equation as:

(< V > − < Ks >)0 = avk + bvk · [F e/H] + 2.33 · logPF , (21)

where the only two unknown quantities are avk and bvk. We
use the linear least squares technique (with 3σ clipping) to
solve the set of equations (21) for all 383 stars with available
< V >, < Ks >, and [Fe/H] to ﬁnd:

(< V > − < Ks >)0 = (1.883 ± 0.019)

(22)

+(0.159 ± 0.013) · [F e/H] + 2.33 · logPF ,

with a scatter of σ(< V > − < Ks >)0 = 0.12. Figure 9
plots the left-hand side of equation (21) as a function [Fe/H]
with linear ﬁt with parameters (22) superimposed.

Obviously, the 3D extinction model Drimmel et al.
(2003) should perform better for objects at high Galactic
latitudes and yield less accurate results in the vicinity of
the Galactic equator. This is immediately apparent from
the plot of residuals of equation (21) as a function of |b|
(Fig. (10)). Residuals can be seen to increase sharply at
|b| 6 25◦. We therefore make a new least-squares ﬁt leav-
ing only stars with |b| > 25◦:

(< V > − < Ks >)0 = (1.863 ± 0.024)

+(0.144 ± 0.016) · [F e/H] + 2.33 · logPF ,

with a scatter of σ(< V > − < Ks >)0 = 0.11. This re-
sult implies, given the adopted metallicity-< MV > relation
(17):

< MKs >= av−1.863+0.088(±0.026)·[F e/H]−2.33·logPF (24)

To make this relation as consistent as possible with the
period-< MKs > relation (6), we set av − 1.863 + 0.088 · (<
[F e/H] >) = −0.90 (here < [F e/H] > = -1.419 is the av-
erage metallicity of sample stars), implying av = 1.088 and
hence:

< MV >= 1.088 + 0.232 · [F e/H]

(25)

and

< MKs >= −0.775+0.088(±0.026)·[F e/H]−2.33·logPF (26)

We now assume that the WISE W1-band absolute mag-
nitudes of RR Lyrae type variables depend both on metal-
licity and fundamentalised period as:

< MW 1 >= aw + bw · [F e/H] + cw · logPF ,

(27)

We subtract equation (27) from equation (18) to obtain
(given that (< Ks > − < W 1 >)0 =< MKs > − <
MW 1 >):

(< Ks > − < W 1 >)0 = akw+bkw ·[F e/H]+ckw ·logPF , (28)

where akw = ak − aw, bkw = bk − bw, and ckw = ck − cw. We
then use the least squares method to solve equation set (28)
for stars with |b| > 25◦:

(< Ks > − < W 1 >)0 = (0.021 ± 0.032)

(29)

−(0.017 ± 0.012) · [F e/H] − (0.039 ± 0.071) · logPF ,

with a scatter of σ(< Ks > − < W 1 >)0 = 0.07. Both the
[Fe/H] and logPF terms are statistically insigniﬁcant and we

therefore seek the most simple solution setting bkw = 0 and
ckw = 0 and leaving only the constant term:

(< Ks > − < W 1 >)0 = (0.056 ± 0.004)

(30)

with a scatter of σ(< Ks > − < W 1 >)0 = 0.07 We
thus derive, in view of relation (26), the following period-
metallicity-< MW 1 > relation :

< MW 1 >= −0.831+0.088(±0.026)·[F e/H]−2.33·logPF , (31)

and the following (< V > − < W 1 >)0 intrinsic colour
calibration:

(< V > − < W 1 >)0 = 1.919(±0.024)

+ 0.144(±0.016) · [F e/H] + 2.33 · logPF ,

(32)

for RR Lyrae type stars. We now reﬁne this calibration by
deriving it directly from the observed (< V > − < W 1 >)
colours assuming that the period-metallicity-< MV > rela-
tion has zero log PF slope and the metallicity slope equal to
bv=0.232±0.020, and the period-metallicity-< MW 1 > re-
lation has the same log PF slope as the period-metallicity-
< MKs > relation (i.e., cw=-2.33) and unknown metallicity
slope:

(< V > − < W 1 >)0 = 1.884(±0.019)

+ 0.120(±0.012) · [F e/H] + 2.33 · logPF

(33)

with a scatter of 0.086. We now use this calibration to deter-
mine the colour excesses E(< V > − < W 1 >) = (< V >
− < W 1 >) − (< V > − < W 1 >)0 for most of the stars at
low Galactic latitudes (|b| 6 25) and convert these colour
excesses into E(B − V ) values by the formula

E(B − V ) = E(< V > − < W 1 >)/(RV − RW 1),

where we adopt RV = 3.1 and RW 1 = 0.18 in accordance
with Yuan et al. (2013). No intensity-mean < W 1 > mag-
nitudes are available for four stars with |b| 6 25. For these
stars we use calibration (24) to compute the colour excesses
E(< V > − < Ks >) = (< V > − < Ks >) − (< V >
− < Ks >)0, which we convert into E(B − V ) values by the
formula

E(B − V ) = E(< V > − < Ks >)/(RV − RKs ),

where RKs = 0.306 (Yuan et al. 2013). For the remaining
stars (i.e., those at |b| > 25) we adopt the E(B − V )
values E(B − V ) = AV /RV computed in terms of the 3D
interstellar extinction model by Drimmel et al. (2003) via
the iterative procedure described above.

The data used in this work (including the accurate coor-
dinates, proper motions (with source and standard-error es-
timate), radial velocities (with source and standard errors),
intensity-mean V -, Ks-, and W 1-band magnitudes (with
source and standard-error estimate), [Fe/H] (with source),

INITIAL DISTANCES

We now again deredden the observed intensity-mean < V >,
< Ks >, and < W 1 > magnitudes using formulae (10–12)
and the ﬁnally adopted E(B −V ) values. We then determine
the initial (assumed) distances to most of the RR Lyrae stars
of our sample based on the period-metallicity-< MW 1 >
relation (31). We use the the period-metallicity-< MKs >
relation (26) to compute the distances to ﬁve stars with no
intensity-mean < W 1 > magnitudes.

Our working sample consists of all stars with simultane-
ously available W 1-band intensity-mean magnitudes, metal-
licities, radial velocities, and UCAC4 proper motions (a total
of 387 stars). Below we apply the method of statistical par-
allax to this sample to determine a correction ∆ < MW 1 >
to the zero point of relation (31) so that

< MW 1(true) >=< MW 1(adopted) > +∆ < MW 1 > .

5 THE METHOD

Throughout this paper, we use the bimodal version of the
classical maximum-likelihood statistical-parallax method
(Murray 1983) as described in Section 2.4 of Dambis (2009).
In this case the likelihood function of obtaining all observa-
tions (apparent magnitudes, fundamental periods, metallic-
ities, radial velocities, and proper motions of all stars of the
sample studied) depends on fourteen parameters: (1) three
components of the relative bulk motion of the objects of the
ﬁrst (U0(1), V0(1), and W0(1)) and second (U0(2), V0(2), and
W0(2)) subsamples with respect to the Sun; (2) three di-
agonal components of velocity ellipsoid of the ﬁrst (σV 2
rg(1),
σV 2
ϕ(2), and σV 2
θ(2))
subsamples, (3) the inverse distance-scale correction factor,
f (the same for both subsamples), and (4) the fraction α of
stars that belong to the ﬁrst subsample (in the bimodal case
the fraction of stars that belong to the second subsample is
evidently equal to 1-α).

6 RESULTS

Layden (1995) and Layden et al. (1996) showed that the
kinematic population of RR Lyraes in our Galaxy breaks
conspicuously into two subclasses: halo and thick-disc stars.
As we pointed out in the previous section, we use the model
incorporating explicitly the bimodal velocity distribution
and compute 14 unknown parameters simultaneously. Ta-
ble 3 lists the results based on the entire sample.

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

Figure 11. Histogram of Galactocentric distances of sample stars

.

Note, however, that despite its mathematical sophisti-
cation, our analysis has at least one weak point: it assumes
that all the quantities characterising the velocity distribu-
tion ( U0, V0, W0, σVR, σVθ, and σW for the halo and thick-
disc subpopulations and their respective fractions) are loca-
tion independent. This is evidently not true, and the corre-
sponding eﬀect cannot be neglected given the large spread
of Galactocentric distances of sample stars (Fig. 11). To re-
duce the inﬂuence of this eﬀect, we repeat our computations
by applying the method to a trimmed sample: we leave only
stars with Galactocentric distances that diﬀer no more than
1.6 kpc from the provisionally adopted Galactocentric dis-
tance of the Sun (R0 = 8 kpc): 6.4 kpc 6 RG 6 9.6 kpc.
The corresponding results are presented in Table 4. Our re-
sult requires no absolute-magnitude zero point correction
(∆ < MW 1 > = +0.006 ± 0.088) and therefore we do not
have to adjust the initial distances or intrinsic-colour cali-
brations (23) and (30), which depend on the adopted extinc-
tion values, which, in turn, depend on the adopted distances
via the 3D interstellar extinction model by Drimmel et al.
(2003).

To check our results for the eventual biases, we use the
same procedure as that employed by Dambis (2009). We
generate for every our solution a set of 400 simulated sam-
ples consisting of objects with exactly the same sky loca-
tions as those of stars in the real sample. We simulate the
”observed” parameters of each object (i.e., the distance, ra-
dial velocity, and proper-motion components) based on the
distance of the corresponding star (which we divide by the
inferred distance-scale correction factor f plus the cosmic
scatter), the mean velocity components ((U0, V0, W0) of
one of the two subpopulations (chosen randomly in accor-
dance with the inferred fractions α and 1-α) with the corre-
sponding velocity ellipsoid (deﬁned by σVrg, σVϕ, and σVθ)
superimposed. We ﬁnally add to the radial velocities and
proper-motion components so computed the corresponding
simulated random errors with zero means and variances de-
termined by the standard errors of the actually observed
quantities. We apply our bimodal method to each of the

simulated samples to estimate the mean oﬀsets of all the
inferred parameters.

We ﬁnd our method to yield unbiased estimates for all
the parameters in the case considered, and therefore apply
no corrections to our results. We adopt the parameters given
by the solution based on the trimmed sample (Table4)as
our ﬁnal result, and, in particular, the corresponding cor-
rected zero point for the infrared PL relation, which is is
0.026m fainter than that the initially adopted value (see
formula (31)), implying the following corrected W1-band
period-metallicity-luminosity relation:

< MW 1 >= −0.825(±0.088)

+ 0.088(±0.026) · [F e/H] − 2.33 · logPF .

(35)

We also apply the same zero-point correction to the V-band
metallicity-luminosity relation given by formula (25) and the
Ks-band period-metallicity-luminosity relation given by for-
mula (26) to obtain the following corrected relations:

< MV >= 1.094(±0.091) + 0.232(±0.020) · [F e/H]

(36)

and

< MKs >= −0.769(±0.088)

∆ < MW 1 >

= +0.065 ± 0.083

+ 0.088(±0.026) · [F e/H] − 2.33 · logPF .

(37)

The implied period-metallicity-luminosity relation for the
CIT K band then is:

< MKCIT >= −0.750(±0.088)+

0.088(±0.026) · [F e/H] − 2.33 · logPF .

(38)

6.1 Comparison to earlier work

The only previous WISE W1-band luminosity calibration
of RR Lyrae type variables is that of Klein et al. (2011),
who found < MW 1 >= (0.421 ± 0.014) − (1.681 ± 0.147) ·
log(P/0.50118day) with no evidence for metallicity term
by computing posterior distances of 76 well observed RR
Lyrae based on the optically constructed prior distances.
Our PL relation is ∼ 0.16m fainter at P = 0.50118 and
[Fe/H]=-1.5, and this is due entirely to the prior distance
estimates adopted by the above authors, which are based on
the < MV > - [Fe/H] relation < MV >=0.93 + 0.23·[Fe/H]
(Chaboyer 1999). The diﬀerence in the slope appears to be
due to fact that Klein et al. (2011) do not fundamentalise
the periods of RRc type stars. We believe this to be a ques-
tionable approach given that (a) RRc type stars form a well-

deﬁned period-shifted (by δ log(P )=-0.127) branch of the
K-band PL relation (see, e.g., Frolov & Samus (1998)) and
(b) intrinsic Ks-W1 colours are practically constant for A-F
type stars, implying that < MW 1 > may serve as a proxy for
< MKs > and that the period-< MW > relation should have
practically the same slope as the period-< MKs > relation
(i.e., -2.33).

Our RR Lyrae V -band luminosity scale zero point
(< MV >=+0.72±0.09 at [Fe/H]=-1.6), albeit consistent
with most of the analyses based on the method of sta-
tistical parallax, diﬀers markedly from the most recent
such study of c-type RR Lyrae variables by Kollmeier et al.
(2012): they found < MV,RRc > = +0.52 ± 0.11 at a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.59, whereas formula (36) im-
plies < MV > = +0.73±0.09 for the same metallicity. This
can be compared with the statistical-parallax based esti-
mates < MV > = +0.71±0.12 (Layden et al. 1996) and
< MV > = +0.75±0.13 (Popowski & Gould 1998a), both
at [Fe/H]=-1.61; < MV > = +0.73±0.14 (Fernley et al.
1998a) at [Fe/H]=-1.53; < MV > = +0.69±0.10 (Tsujimoto
1998) at [Fe/H]=-1.58; < MV > = +0.65±0.23 (Luri et al.
1998) at [Fe/H]=-1.51, and < MV > = +0.76–0.78±0.10
(Dambis & Rastorguev 2001) at [Fe/H]=-1.60.

Our zero point of the K-band luminosity calibra-
tion is also consistent with the previous statistical-parallax
determinations < MKs > = -0.82±0.12 -2.33·log(PF )
(Dambis 2003), < MKs > = -0.89±0.09 -2.33·log(PF )
(Dambis & Vozyakova 2004), < MKs > = -0.94±0.06
-2.33·log(PF ) (Rastorguev, Dambis & Zabolotskikh 2005),
and < MKs > = -0.818±0.08 -2.33·log(PF ) (Dambis 2009)
compared to < MKs > = -0.901±0.09 -2.33·log(PF ) (for-
mula (37) with [Fe/H] ﬁxed at -1.5).

Both our V - and Ks-band absolute-magnitude cali-
brations agree well with the results obtained using the
Baade-Wesselink method: < MK > = -0.88 -2.33·log(PF )
and < MV > = 1.02+0.16·[Fe/H] (the latter implies
< MV > = +0.76±0.03 at [Fe/H] = -1.6) (Jones et al.
1992) and < MV > = 0.98+0.20·[Fe/H] (implying <
MV > = +0.66±0.05 at [Fe/H] = -1.6) (Fernley et al.
1998b)).

At the same time, our RR Lyrae luminosity scale is
inconsistent with HST trigonometric parallaxes of ﬁve RR
Lyrae type variables: our < MV >, < MKs >, and <
MW 1 > zero points are 0.34±0.05, 0.32±0.05, and 0.34±0.05
fainter than those inferred by applying the reduced paral-

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

= +0.006 ± 0.088

lax method to the HST parallax data Benedict et al. (2011).
The reason for such a discrepancy remains unclear.

Our V - and K- band luminosity scales are also apprecia-
bly fainter than the estimates based on analyses based on
theoretical models (Bono et al. 2003; Catelan et al. 2004)
and that deﬁned by the period-metallicity-< MK > rela-
tion of Sollima et al. (2008): < MK >=-1.07 - 2.38·log PF
+0.09·[F e/H]ZW . The latter is tied to the HST parallax of
RR Lyrae itself and is therefore naturally ∼0.3m brighter
than our period-metallicity-< MK > relation (see above).
Note, however, that our metallicity slope, which is equal
to +0.088±0.026, practically coincides with that of the rela-
tion derived by Sollima et al. (2008), but is appreciably shal-
lower than the values of 0.231±0.012 and 0.277 estimates de-
rived theoretically by Bono et al. (2003) and Catelan et al.
(2004), respectively. We compare our metallicity-< MV >
relation with the published ones in Fig 12. A similar compar-
ison of period-< MK > relations (at [Fe/H]=-1.6) is made
in Fig. 13.

We thus see that, as always before, the method of statis-
tical parallax, like the Baade–Wesselink method, continues
to yield RR Lyrae luminosities and distances that are at
the lower end of the estimates obtained using various tech-
niques. The cause of the discrepancies with other methods
remains unknown and can hardly be attributed to photo-
metric or astrometric errors given the dramatic improve-
ment of the quality of the corresponding data both in terms
of random errors and homogeneity. Neither can it be due to
eventual systematic errors in the estimated amount of in-
terstellar extinction, which is rather small for most of the
RR Lyrae variables considered: its average value in the V
band is less than 0.2m, and becomes negligible in the Ks and
W 1 bands (0.019m and 0.013m, respectively). Furthermore,
the < MKs >- and < MW 1 >-band absolute magnitudes
depend only slightly on metallicity and therefore metallic-
ity errors are very unlikely to introduce any signiﬁcant bi-
ases into these quantities. As shown by Popowski & Gould
(1998a,b), the same is true for eventual radial-velocity er-
rors and errors in the adopted kinematical model. We hope
that the upcoming GAIA mission will ﬁnally resolve this
controversy.

The kinematical results obtained appear to be consis-
tent with earlier statistical-parallax based results for RR
Lyrae type stars ((Layden et al. 1996; Fernley et al. 1998a;
Dambis & Rastorguev 2001; Dambis 2009; Kollmeier et al.

in their paper) and the fundamental kinematical study of
halo stars by Carollo et al. (2007) (Supplemental Table 1),
Carollo et al. (2010). As in our previous paper (Dambis
2009), we ﬁnd no signs of the outer halo population with ret-
rograde rotation and large σVR and σVθ velocity-dispersion
components, which was to be expected given that our sam-
ple contains very few distant enough stars.

7 DISTANCE-SCALE IMPLICATIONS

Carney et al. (1995) estimated the distance to the Galac-
tic centre to be R0 = 7.80 ± 0.40 kpc based on the
KCIT -band photometry of Galactic bulge RR Lyraes
and the assumed PL relation by Jones et al. (1992) (for-
mula (4)). Pietrukowicz et al.
(2012) ﬁnd the average
metallicity of Galactic bulge RR Lyrae type variables
to be < [F e/H] > = -1.02 on the scale of Jurcsik
(1995). This corresponds to < [F e/H] >ZW = 1.028 · (-
1.02) - 0.242 = -1.29 (Papadakis et al. 2000) on the
Zinn & West (1984) metallicity scale. The resulting zero
point of the (CIT) K-band PL relation for bulge RR
Lyraes is then equal to -0.750 + 0.088·(-1.29)=-0.863
(formula (38)), implying a solar Galactocentric distance of
R0 = (7.80 ± 0.40) · 10−0.2·(−0.863−(−0.88)) = 7.74 ± 0.40 kpc.
Groenewegen et al. (2008) performed Ks-band observa-
tions of 39 type-II Cepheids and 37 RR Lyrae type
in the Galactic bulge and estimated the RR
stars
Lyrae based distance to the Galactic
centre to be
R0 = 7.87 ± 0.64 kpc ± 0.26 kpc using the period-
metallicity-< MK > relation by Sollima et al. (2006).
When recalibrated to our period-metallicity-< MK >
relation, their RR Lyrae type star photometry yields a solar
Galactocentric distance of R0 = 7.19 ± 0.40 kpc ± 0.24 kpc.
Based on OGLE II observations of stars in the Galactic
bulge, Collinge, Sumi & Fabrycky (2006) ﬁnd the average
extinction-corrected intensity-mean V -band magnitude
of RR Lyrae type stars in the Baade window to be
< V0 >=15.44±0.05. Given the average metallicity of
[Fe/H]=-1.0 of bulge stars, our [Fe/H]-< MV > rela-
tion (36) yields an absolute magnitude of < MV >=+0.862,
implying a GC distance modulus of DMGC = 14.58±0.10,
or R0=8.24±0.39 kpc. The average of the three estimates,
R0=7.73±0.36 kpc, is consistent both with the result based
on the PL relation of type II Cepheids (R0 = 7.64 ±
0.21 kpc (Feast et al. 2008) and R0 = 7.99 ± 0.09 kpc
(Groenewegen et al. 2008)) and with the direct estimate
based on the orbital solution for the star S0-2 orbiting the
supermassive black hole at the Galactic centre (R0 = 8.28
± 0.15 ± 0.29 kpc (Gillessen et al. 2009)).

If applied to the Ks-band photometry for 30 RR Lyrae
type variables in Reticulum Dall’Ora et al. (2004) ([Fe/H]=-
1.71), PML relation (37) yields a distance modulus of 18.22
± 0.01 ± 0.09 (D = 44.1 ± 0.2 ± 1.7 kpc) for this clus-
ter, which is purportedly associated with the LMC. The
DReticulum/DLM Ccentre ratio can be estimated using a ge-
ometric model of the LMC, which is parametrised by the
inclination i and position angle of the line of nodes, P A by
the following formula:

DReticulum/DLM Ccentre =

cos i/[cos i cos ρ − sin i sin ρ sin(Φ − P A)]

(39)

(van der Marel & Cioni 2001), where ρ=11.4◦ and Φ=329◦
are the angular distance and position angle of Reticulum
with respect to the LMC, respectively (Schommer et al.
1992). Recent estimates of the LMC orientation parame-
ters P A and i (van der Marel & Cioni 2001; Olsen & Salyk
2002; Nikolaev et al. 2004; Persson et al. 2004; Koerwer
2009; Subramanian & Subramaniam 2010, 2013) yield
DReticulum/DLM Ccentre ratios ranging from 0.959 to 1.041
corresponding to distance-scale corrections ranging from -

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

RR Lyrae variables: visual and infrared luminosities, intrinsic colours, and kinematics

13

0.09 to +0.09 with a mean of -0.01 and a standard deviation
of 0.06. Hence the Reticulum distance derived yields an LMC
distance modulus of 18.21 ± 0.01 ± 0.09 ± 0.06 (D = 43.9 ±
0.2 ± 1.7 kpc ± 1.2 kpc). The Ks-band photometry of 10 RR
Lyrae type stars in the inner regions of the LMC with spec-
troscopically measured [Fe/H] (Borissova et al. 2004) yields
a distance modulus of 18.38 ± 0.04 ± 0.09 (D = 47.4 ±
0.9 ± 2.0 kpc), and the similar data (65 stars) obtained
by Szewczyk et al. (2008) imply an LMC distance modulus
of 18.30 ± 0.02 ± 0.09 (D = 45.7 ± 0.7 ± 1.9 kpc). The
V -band intensity-mean magnitudes and metallicities of 89
RR Lyrae type stars determined by Gratton et al. (2004)
analyzed in terms of our metallicity-V -band luminosity re-
lation (36) yield an LMC distance modulus of 18.34 ± 0.02
± 0.09 (D = 46.6 ± 0.7 ± 2.1 kpc). We thus derive an av-
erage LMC distance modulus estimate of DMLM C = 18.32
± 0.09 (D = 46.1 ± 2.0 kpc). This result is consistent with
the estimate based on the PL relation of classical Cepheids
and their HST trigonometric parallaxes: Feast et al. (2008)
report DMLM C = 18.39 ± 0.05 as inferred from the estimate
of Benedict et al. (2007) with the metallicity correction of
Macri et al. (2006). Our LMC distance modulus also agrees
with the recent LMC distance estimate based on type II
Cepheids (DMLM C = 18.37±0.09 (Feast et al. 2008)). How-
ever, it is ∼1.3-2.2σ smaller than the DMLM C = 18.46 ±
0.06 – 18.61 ± 0.05 (D = 49.2 ± 1.4 kpc – 52.7 ± 1.2 kpc) es-
timates implied by V - and Ks-band photometry of RR Lyrae
type variables in the LMC and HST triginometric parallaxes
of ﬁve Galactic RR Lyraes (Benedict et al. 2011), and ∼1.5σ
smaller than the DMLM C = 18.49 ± 0.05 (D = 49.97 ± 1.11
kpc) estimate inferred from observations of eclipsing bina-
ries (Pietrzy´nski et al. 2013) and the DMLM C = 18.48 ±
0.04 (D = 49.66 ± 0.92 kpc) estimate inferred from 3.6- and
4.5-µm observations of classical Cepheids made by Spitzer
Space Telescope and calibrated by HST guide-star paral-
laxes of 10 Galactic Cepheids (Monson et al. 2012).

Clementini et al. (2009) analysed archival HST pho-
tometry of stars in the metal-poor globular cluster B514 in
the M31 galaxy and identiﬁed 89 RR Lyrae type variables.
Our V -band luminosity calibration (formula (36)) implies a
distance modulus of DMB514 = 24.32 ± 0.12 (D = 731 ±
41 kpc)

Federici et al. (2012) collected and analysed archival
HST BV I photometry for 48 globular clusters in the M31
galaxy. They determined the apparent horizontal-branch V -
band magnitudes, MV (HB), and estimated the reddenings
and metallicities of these clusters by comparing their ob-
served colour-magnitude diagrams to the colour-magnitude
diagram ridge lines of a set of Galactic reference globu-
lar clusters. Given that in a globular cluster MV (HB) =
< MV (RRLyr) >, we apply formula (36) to the data of
Federici et al. (2012) to obtain an M31 distance modulus
estimate of DMM 31 = 24.201 ± 0.014 ± 0.090 (D = 692 ±
5 ± 28 kpc).

When applied to the results of an an extensive survey
of RR Lyrae type variables in three ﬁelds along the major
axis of the M33 galaxy by Yang et al. (2010), our V -band
metallicity-luminosity relation (36) yields a distance modu-
lus of DMM 33 = 24.36 ± 0.09 (D = 745 ± 31 kpc).

Table 5 summarises the RR Lyr (or horizontal-branch)
based distance estimates mentioned above, and other such
distance estimates for a number of Local-Group galax-

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

ies. Our distance moduli are, on the average, 0.13 smaller
than most recent published estimates. This diﬀerence is
due mostly to the diﬀerence in the zero points of the un-
derlying calibrations, which are generally based on some
reference LMC distance modulus (cf. our DMLM C =
18.34±0.09 with the estimates DMLM C (F reedman) =
18.477±0.033 and DMLM C (Riess) = 18.486±0.065 adopted
by Freedman et al. (2012) and Riess et al. (2011), respec-
tively.

8 ROTATION OF THE RR LYRAE

POPULATIONS

Our estimate for the distance to the Galactic center,
R0=7.73±0.36 kpc, combined with the proper motion of
Sgr A∗ along Galactic longitude, µSgrA∗ = 6.379 ± 0.026
mas/yr (Reid & Brunthaler 2004), implies a solar velocity
of V·=234±10 km/s. It follows from this that the halo RR
Lyrae population exhibits marginal prograde rotation with
a velocity of 20±15 km/s. The thick-disc RR Lyrae popula-
tion rotates at a velocity of 193±13 km/s.

9 COSMOLOGY

Our result, if taken at face value, would upscale the Hubble
constant as estimated by Freedman et al. (2012) (H0 = 74.3
± 2.1 km/s/Mpc) to H0 = 80.0 ± 3.4 km/s/Mpc, and imply,
if combined with ΩΛ= 0.74±0.02 (Mohlabeng & Ralston
2013) based on an analysis of a sample of 580 type Ia su-
pernovae in terms of a ﬂat, LCDM cosmological model, an
expansion age of 12.5 Gyr, which is consistent with the
globular-cluster ages of 12–13 Gyr (Carretta et al. 2000).

10 CONCLUSIONS

We collected homogenized data for 403 local Galactic ﬁeld
RR Lyrae variables: intensity-mean V -band, 2MASS Ks-
band, and WISE W 1-band magnitudes for 384, 403, and 398
stars, respectively; metallicity estimates on the Zinn & West
(1984) scale for 402 stars, UCAC4 proper motions for
393 stars, as well as radial velocities and interstellar-
extinction estimates for all 403 stars. We used the photo-
metric data combined the 3D interstellar extinction model
by Drimmel et al. (2003) to calibrate RR Lyrae star colours
in terms of fundamental period and metallicity and used
these calibrations to determine the log PF and metallicity
slopes of the 2MASS Ks-band and WISE W 1-band infrared
period-metallicity-luminosity relations. We performed a bi-
modal statistical-parallax solution on the subsample of stars
with both WISE W 1-band intensity-mean magnitudes and
UCAC4 proper motions available. We found the velocity
components (relative to the Sun) of the halo and thick-
disc populations along the direction of Galactic rotation
to be V0(Halo)=-214±10 km/s and V0(Disc)=-37±6 km/s,
respectively. The inferred velocity-ellipsoid components of
are (σVR(Halo), σVφ(Halo), σVθ(Halo)) = (153 ± 9, 101 ±
6, 96 ± 5) km s−1 and (σVR(Disc), σVθ(Disc), σW (Disc)) =
(46 ± 7, 37 ± 5, 27 ± 4) km s−1 for the halo and thick-disc,
respectively, and the fraction of thick-disc stars, 0.22 ± 0.03.

Remarks: a. Reticulum globular cluster. It may be rather distant from the centre of the LMC
and we therefore use a geometric model to estimate the distance to the LMC centre (see text). b. B514 globular cluster.

Our kinematical results agree well with those of other stud-
ies, and our ﬁnal IR period-metallicity-luminosity relations
and the V -band metallicity-luminosity relation are consis-
tent with most of the previous statistical-parallax based es-
timates (with the exception of the statistical-parallax analy-
sis of c-type RR Lyrae variables by Kollmeier et al. (2012))
and the results of the application of the Baade–Wesselink
method, but generally fainter than implied by the results

obtained using other methods. The distance moduli of Local
Group galaxies estimated using our derived IR and optical
luminosity calibrations are, on the average, 0.13 smaller than
recently published determinations, implying a Hubble con-
stant of ∼ 80 km/s and a rather small – 12.5 Gyr–expansion
age of the Universe.
