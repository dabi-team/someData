ABSTRACT

Context. Studies of the eﬀects of environment on galaxy properties and evolution require well deﬁned control samples. Such isolated
galaxy samples have up to now been small or poorly deﬁned. The AMIGA project (Analysis of the interstellar Medium of Isolated
GAlaxies) represents an attempt to deﬁne a statistically useful sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local (z≤0.05) Universe.
Aims. A suitable large sample for the AMIGA project already exists, the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG, Karachentseva 1973;
1050 galaxies), and we use this sample as a starting point to reﬁne and perform a better quantiﬁcation of its isolation properties.
Methods. Digitised POSS-I E images were analysed out to a minimum projected radius R ≥ 0.5 Mpc around 950 CIG galaxies (those
within Vr = 1500 km s−1 were excluded). We identiﬁed all galaxy candidates in each ﬁeld brighter than B = 17.5 with a high degree
of conﬁdence using the LMORPHO software. We generated a catalogue of approximately 54 000 potential neighbours (redshifts exist
for ≈ 30% of this sample).
Results. Six hundred sixty-six galaxies pass and two hundred eighty-four fail the original CIG isolation criterion. The available
redshift data conﬁrm that our catalogue involves a largely background population rather than physically associated neighbours. We
ﬁnd that the exclusion of neighbours within a factor of four in size around each CIG galaxy, employed in the original isolation
criterion, corresponds to ∆Vr ≈ 18000 km s−1 indicating that it was a conservative limit.
Conclusions. Galaxies in the CIG have been found to show diﬀerent degrees of isolation. We conclude that a quantitative measure of
this is mandatory. It will be the subject of future work based on the catalogue of neighbours obtained here.

1. Introduction

During the past 30 years it has become clear that galaxy proper-
ties (e.g. morphology, star formation, nuclear activity) and evo-
lution may be driven as strongly by environment as by initial
conditions. The role of environmental conditions is not yet fully
quantiﬁed for at least two reasons: 1) confusion about the deﬁni-
tion of “environment” and 2) lack of control samples of galaxies
minimally aﬀected by environment. The former confusion arises
because there are two kinds of (observable) environmental in-
ﬂuences: a) one-on-one and b) local galaxy surface density. A
single, sometimes diﬃcult to identify, neighbour can be capable

of a larger eﬀect than an enhanced local galaxy surface density.
Eﬀects related to local galaxy surface density can be especially
diﬃcult to quantify because automated sample selection can of-
ten miss these close neighbours. Ideally we seek a statistically
useful sample of galaxies that has been carefully cleaned of: a)
close neighbours and that reside in b) the lowest galaxy surface
density regions of the local Universe. In order to be statistically
useful the sample must be large enough to allow us to assess
environmental eﬀects both as a function of morphological type
and luminosity. The motivation of the AMIGA (Analysis of the
Interstellar Medium of Isolated GAlaxies1) project is to identify
such a sample of isolated galaxies.

The AMIGA project adopted the Catalogue of Isolated
Galaxies (CIG: Karachentseva 1973) as a starting point. The

strength of the CIG involves its size (1050 galaxies) and its selec-
tion with a strong isolation criterion. Redshifts are available for
almost the entire sample, which is large enough to allow severe
reﬁnement without reducing the resulting catalogue to a few tens
of galaxies. Previous papers in this series included: 1) improve-
ment in positional accuracy (Leon & Verdes-Montenegro 2003),
2) optical characterisation including derivation of the optical lu-
minosity function (AMIGA-I: Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2005),
3) morphological revision using POSS-II (and SDSS over-
lap) and type-speciﬁc OLF analysis (AMIGA-II: Sulentic et al.
2006) and 4) mid- and far-infrared properties using the IRAS
database (AMIGA-III: Lisenfeld et al. 2007). Studies of the ra-
dio continuum, HI (Espada et al. 2005, Espada 2006), CO and
Hα emission (Verley 2005) properties are in progress along with
a study of the small AGN population found in the sample. This
paper focuses on a reassessment of the isolation degree for all
galaxies in the CIG with Vr ≥ 1500 km s−1. A diﬀerent assess-
ment strategy is required for the nearest galaxies in our sample
which are all part of the local supercluster.

In our previous works we identiﬁed several CIG galaxies
failing Karachentseva’s criterion, hence motivating us to care-
fully revise the isolation of the CIG members. Here we perform
a census of the environment of the most isolated galaxies in the
local Universe (within ∼350 Mpc) located in the northern hemi-
sphere. In Sect. 2, we review previous work on isolated galaxies.
In Sect. 3, we present in detail the CIG as well as several revi-
sions and improvements performed in the bibliography. We also
illustrate the isolation deﬁnition using the Milky Way as an ex-
ample. In Sect. 4, we describe in detail the method used to revise
the isolation of the CIG galaxies, including a description of our
automated pipeline used to produce a catalogue of their potential
neighbours. We have also compiled redshifts for these possible
neighbours from available databases, as we explain in Sect. 5. In
Sect. 6, we revise Karachentseva’s catalogue in order to deter-
mine how many galaxies still remain isolated based on our new
data. We present our conclusions in Sect. 7. From our study we
conclude that a quantiﬁcation of the isolation is needed; this will
be presented in a future article (Verley et al. 2007, in prep.).

2. Previous work on samples of isolated galaxies

Interest in isolated galaxy compilations increased in the 1970s-
80s as evidence accumulated that mergers,
interactions or
simply high local galaxy environmental density can play
an important role in observed galaxy properties and evolu-
tion (Toomre & Toomre 1972, Sulentic 1976, Toomre 1977,
Larson & Tinsley 1978, Stocke et al. 1978). As recently as 1975
the consensus was against an interaction induced signature in
interacting galaxies (e.g., Allen et al. 1973). The CIG was criti-
cised as a poor ﬁeld sample because it obviously lacked global
homogeneity (Haynes & Giovanelli 1983). Given the identiﬁ-
able components of the CIG mentioned above it is not sur-
prising that the full CIG sample failed a covariance analysis
(Vettolani et al. 1986). The latter study oﬀered an alternative,
albeit small (43 galaxies), catalogue of very isolated galaxies.
Paradoxically only one CIG galaxy (CIG 319) was included
in this automated compilation while many were found to be
components of isolated binary galaxies (Catalogue of Pairs of
Galaxies, CPG) compiled by Karachentsev (1972) in a compan-
ion survey to the CIG. This result illustrates the danger inherent
in compiling 2D (or 3D) catalogues of isolated galaxies with a
sharp magnitude cutoﬀ. Such catalogues will often include ﬁrst
ranked galaxies in cluster cores as well as close (especially hi-
erarchical) binaries where one component falls just below the

cutoﬀ magnitude of the catalogue employed. The one clear re-
sult to emerge from the above eﬀort is that CIG 319 is likely to
be a very isolated galaxy.

A debate on the nature of the spatial distribution of galax-
ies took place in the mid-1970s: using the covariance function
of the distribution of galaxies, Peebles (1974a,b) found no ev-
idence of an initially homogeneous component of the galaxy
population and, on the contrary, endorsed the view of hierar-
chical series of densities. However, studying galaxies brighter
than 14th magnitude, Turner & Gott (1975) found two distinct
populations, one strongly clustered and a population of “single”
galaxies (32%) distributed homogeneously on scales ≤ 20 Mpc.
But Soneira & Peebles (1977) showed that the previous sample
did not constitute a true ﬁeld population and if such a population
existed, it amounted to substantially less than 18% in a cata-
logue selected by apparent magnitude. Huchra & Thuan (1977)
revised the Turner & Gott sample down to a fainter magnitude
(15.7 mag) and found that isolated galaxies could only represent
3.6% of all the galaxies. Vettolani et al. (1986) also emphasised
that isolated galaxies did not exist in an absolute sense because
clustering on large scale dominates in all regions of space (for
small redshift at least).

Studies comparing redshifts of isolated galaxies with red-
shifts of groups conﬁrmed that isolated galaxies generally be-
long to groups, but at such large distances from their cen-
tres (∼ 4 Mpc) that they have not undergone any physical
inﬂuence from these groups (Balkowski & Chamaraux 1981).
Haynes & Giovanelli (1983) showed that likewise most of the
isolated galaxies are outer components of groups or clusters.

independent

Hence, it seems diﬃcult to ﬁnd a truly isolated population
of galaxies, but instead one can have access to regions of very
low galaxy density, where the galaxies reﬂect properties char-
acterising their formation. However, during the past 30 years,
a variety of widely diﬀerent criteria has been used when deﬁn-
ing isolation (magnitude limited samples, redshift information
used or not, distance to the nearest galaxies diﬀerent from one
deﬁnition to the other, etc.), as shown by the abundant liter-
ature: Turner & Gott (1975), Balkowski & Chamaraux (1981),
Vettolani et al. (1986), Zaritsky et al. (1993), Aars et al. (2001),
Colbert et al. (2001), Pisano et al. (2002), Prada et al. (2003),
M´arquez & Moles (1996, 1999), M´arquez et al. (2002, 2003),
Varela et al. (2004). Most of these studies only sample ten to
approximately two hundred galaxies, which is not suﬃcient for
statistical analysis.
Studies with

usually
involve small numbers and show a surprisingly small
overlap with the CIG (e.g., Xanthopoulos & de Robertis
1991, M´arquez & Moles 1996, 1999, Morgan et al. 1998,
Aguerri 1999, Pisano & Wilcots 1999, Colbert et al. 2001,
Kornreich et al. 2001, Pisano et al. 2002, Madore et al. 2004,
Reda et al. 2004). In a few cases the samples include southern
objects that lie outside the CIG sky coverage. Many of them,
surprisingly, contain more overlap with catalogues of pairs or
triplets than with the CIG. This usually involves computer-based
compilations from a magnitude limited (2D or 3D) catalogue
(Turner & Gott 1975, Vettolani et al. 1986). If one of the galax-
ies in a pair falls below the magnitude limit of the catalogue
then the pair will be adopted as an isolated single galaxy more
readily than a CIG member. The pair isolation criterion is more
stringent if isolation is deﬁned in terms of pair separation rather
than a component galaxy diameter. Visual conﬁrmation of
isolation is essential and is one of the strengths of the CIG. This
list is not intended to argue about the relative merits of diﬀerent
isolated galaxy selection criteria. It is intended to show: 1) the

lack of consensus about what constitutes a reasonable isolated
galaxy or isolated galaxy sample, 2) how diﬃcult it can be to
compare diﬀerent results for diﬀerent selected isolated samples
and 3) the confusion about selection on the basis of nearest
neighbour vs. selection on the basis of local surface density.

Most galaxies in other samples that are found north of δ =
−3◦, and are missing from the CIG, reﬂect violation of the CIG
isolation criterion rather than having been overlooked during the
CIG compilation. The CIG isolation criterion is more stringent
than most others that have been used. One of the goals of the
AMIGA project is to extract from the CIG a signiﬁcant subsam-
ple of the most isolated galaxies which must represent the low
density tail of galaxy population in the local Universe. The re-
mainder of the sample will involve degrees of lesser isolation
where eﬀects of environment might begin to be detected. One of
our goals is to detect that threshold.

3. The Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies

3.1. Deﬁnition

The catalogue is composed of 1051 objects with apparent
Zwicky magnitude mzw brighter than 15.7 and declination >
−3◦. Karachentseva visually inspected the Palomar Sky Survey
prints, trying to identify those galaxies in the Catalogue of
Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies (CGCG, Zwicky et al. 1968)
which have no near similar size neighbours. Primary galaxies
with angular diameter Dp are considered isolated if any neigh-
bour with diameters Di (with Dp/4 ≤ Di ≤ 4Dp) has an appar-
ent angular separation Rip, from the primary galaxy, greater than
20Di.

This criterion statistically implies that all possible eﬀects of
a past interaction on the morphological or dynamical properties
of a CIG galaxy, or those concerning the enhancement of star
formation processes, have likely been erased at the present time.
Because this represents a lower limit on the time since the last
interaction between a CIG galaxy and a potential neighbour, the
CIG galaxies have apparently been isolated for much (if not all)
of their existence. For instance, for a CIG galaxy with Dp = 3′,
no neighbour with Di = 12′ may lie within 240′ and no neigh-
bour with Di = 0.′75 may lie within 15′. If one assumes an aver-
age Dp = 25 kpc for a CIG galaxy and a typical “ﬁeld” velocity V
= 150 km s−1 then an approximately equal mass perturber would
require 3×109 years to traverse a distance of 20Di (Stocke 1978).
This is a conservative criterion in the sense that, since no
redshift data is used for the isolation deﬁnition, a truly isolated
galaxy may be excluded from the CIG due to a projected back-
ground/foreground neighbour: galaxies isolated in space do not
necessarily appear isolated in the sky. As a result of these projec-
tion eﬀects the CIG is not fully complete. Nevertheless, the sam-
ple is still reasonably complete, according to the Schmidt (1968)
luminosity volume test which gives <V/Vm> = 0.42 at a Zwicky
magnitude of 15.0 (Huchra & Thuan 1977, Xu & Sulentic 1991,
Toledo et al. 1999, Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2005). On the other
hand all galaxies that are included should be isolated. The CIG
is a sample of galaxies isolated from similarly sized neighbours,
but it is clear that dwarf neighbours are not excluded.

Several reﬁnements of the CIG have been performed since
its selection. Karachentseva (1980) discussed her isolation cri-
terion and found that 24 galaxies (with known radial veloci-
ties) passed the isolation criterion and belong to pairs, groups,
or clusters. Other authors (Stocke 1978, Haynes & Giovanelli
1984, Xu & Sulentic 1991) reported that some CIG galaxies are,
in fact, members of interacting systems: CIGs 6, 7, 80, 197, 247,

851, 853, 938, 940, 946, 1027, 1028.

Adams et al. (1980) and Karachentseva (19862) reﬁned the

original isolation criterion by assigning the following codes:

– Code 0: Isolated according to Karachentseva (902 galaxies);
– Code 1: Marginally isolated (85 galaxies);
– Code 2: Member of a group or cluster (64 galaxies).

A few detailed studies of CIG galaxies (recognised
as very isolated) also exist, see for
instance: CIG 947
(Verdes-Montenegro et al. 1995); CIG 121 (Karachentsev et al.
1996); CIG 710 (Verdes-Montenegro et al. 1997); CIGs 164,
412, 425, 557, 684, 792, 824, 870, 877 (Marcum et al. 2004);
CIG 96 (Espada et al. 2005).

The CIG is complemented by catalogues of isolated pairs,
triplets and compact groups (largely quartets); none of them take
into account more hierarchical systems.

3.2. Would the Galaxy belong to the CIG?

In order to illustrate Karachentseva’s isolation criterion we have
applied it to the Milky Way for which the distances and sizes of
its neighbours are relatively well known (Grebel 2006).

The Milky Way is a common spiral galaxy (its stellar mass
is about 1011 M⊙), with a disk of about 30 kpc in diame-
ter. Hence, all the galaxies which would possibly violate the
Karachentseva’s criterion would have diameters between ∼ 7.5
kpc for the smallest and 120 kpc for the largest. As the neigh-
bour galaxies can lie at a distance as large as 20 times their
diameter away, we would have to check for all the members
within 2.4 Mpc. Among the nearby groups of galaxies, only the
Sculptor group (1.8 Mpc away) lies inside this limit, the others
are all further than 3 Mpc, hence not concerned (M 81: 3.1 Mpc;
Centaurus: 3.5 Mpc; M 101: 7.7 Mpc; M 66 + M 96: 9.4 Mpc;
NGC 1023: 9.5 Mpc; etc.). The Sculptor group has six mem-
bers: NGC 253 (diameter of 14.4 kpc), the brightest galaxy of
the group, would not violate the isolation criterion.

Hence, the question of the isolation of the Milky Way would
only involve galaxies of the Local Group. Our galaxy’s bright-
est satellite systems are the Magellanic Clouds. The Large

Magellanic Cloud is 49 kpc away and has a diameter of ∼
9.3 kpc: this neighbour violates Karachentseva’s criterion. The
Small Magellanic Cloud has a diameter of about 5.4 kpc and
would not be taken into account by Karachentseva’s criterion:
we see here a limitation of the criterion which does not take into
account dwarf companions, already mentioned in the previous
section.

farther away,

Belonging to the local Group but

the
Andromeda Galaxy (M 31) has an apparent angular major di-
ameter of 190′, corresponding to about 40 kpc. Its inﬂuence
would aﬀect any galaxy as far as 800 kpc from it, according to
the Karachentseva’s criterion. Since the distance separating the
Milky Way from the Andromeda galaxy is about 725 kpc, this
latter would also violate Karachentseva’s criterion. On the other
hand, the Triangulum galaxy (M 33) is about 840 kpc away and,
due to its relatively small diameter (∼ 16.2 kpc), would not exert
any noticeable inﬂuence on the Milky Way. This would be true
if the system Milky Way-M 33 would have been seen in the best
case (the line of sight perpendicular to the plane deﬁned by the
two galaxies). If the system is seen from other points of view,
the apparent distance separating the two galaxies will become
smaller and reach a point where the Milky Way would no longer
appear isolated relative to M 33. This illustrates the above re-
ferred eﬀect of incompleteness induced by a strong deﬁnition of
isolation, depending on apparent 2D distances.

4. The AMIGA revision

Despite the various revisions by the authors cited in Sect. 2, we
chose to improve Karachentseva’s sample by checking in an au-
tomated, homogeneous way the isolation of the galaxies and by
listing/classifying the neighbour galaxies.

4.1. The sample

We have excluded from our revision all the CIG galaxies with ra-
dial velocities lower than 1500 km s−1 (100 galaxies, see Fig. 1
for the velocity distribution of all the CIG galaxies) since, as
pointed out by Stocke (1978) and Haynes & Giovanelli (1984),
the area searched for potential neighbours of nearby CIG galax-
ies is spread over a large surface on the sky, which makes the
search overwhelming. Our ﬁnal target sample is composed of
950 CIG galaxies.

4.2. Data analysis

We developed an original method to check the isolation of the
CIG galaxies. This work was motivated by the fact that ob-
jects brighter than an apparent magnitude mB ≈ 17.5 are mis-
classiﬁed at a high rate in present on-line reductions of the all-
sky Schmidt surveys. Fainter than mB ≈ 17.5, the mean isopho-
tal surface brightness of stars begins to be comparable with that
of many galaxies, and the number of pixels per source at this
level (assuming a typical isophotal threshold of µB ≈ 23.5) is
too small to unambiguously diﬀerentiate stars and galaxies on
the basis of shape. In the following, we describe the method used
to reliably identify bright (i.e. mB < 17.5) galaxies around our
CIG ﬁelds of interest.

4.2.1. Size of the studied ﬁelds

In order to recover the bright galaxies with high success rate,
we reduced bright image classiﬁcation in our CIG ﬁelds us-

ing Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I E, central wave-
length = 6510 Å) images obtained with the Digitised Sky Survey
(DSS). We have assembled a software pipeline for producing
star/galaxy catalogues in the area around each CIG ﬁeld. The
digital images have a pixel size of 25 µm (1.′′7/pixel).

We chose to evaluate the isolation degree in a minimum
physical radius of 0.5 Mpc (H0 = 75 km s−1 Mpc−1), centred
on each CIG galaxy (see Fig. 2). Assuming a ﬁeld velocity of
150 km s−1, it would require at least 3.2 × 109 years for a neigh-
bour to travel over this radius. Due to pipeline capacity and
server limits, we could not handle ﬁelds larger than 55′ × 55′.
To reach the physical radius of 0.5 Mpc, the ﬁelds requiring a
larger size were composed of various 55′ × 55′ ﬁelds, with a
small strip overlapping between two adjacent ﬁelds. We devel-
oped a tool to keep only one source when an object was detected
more than once in adjacent ﬁelds. Below, we show the number
of CIG galaxies in each ﬁeld size employed:

– 767 galaxies with 55′ × 55′ ;
– 134 galaxies with multi-ﬁelds 110′ × 110′;
– 49 galaxies with multi-ﬁelds 165′ × 165′.

The 55′ × 55′ ﬁelds concerned galaxies with an observed
recession velocity greater than 4687 km s−1 (including the 62
galaxies with no velocity data, see Table 1); the 110′×110′ multi-
ﬁelds correspond to galaxies between 2343 and 4687 km s−1; the
165′ ×165′ multi-ﬁelds to recession velocities between 1500 and
2343 km s−1.

above the separation line (blue points) are classiﬁed as Galaxy,
while the ones below are classiﬁed as Star. The objects fainter
than the extent of the separation line are not classiﬁed, their type
is Unknown.

4.2.2. Detection of the sources

the
We used SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) to detect
sources in the images, with a threshold 3 times higher than
the root mean square of the background estimation. Before the
source extraction we applied a Gaussian convolution with a full
width at half maximum of 2 pixels and a size of 5 × 5 square
pixels. Then, all the objects larger than 4 pixels were detected,
which corresponds to a diameter smaller than 2 kpc at the typi-
cal distance of the CIG galaxies (corresponding to a velocity of
about 6500 km s−1, see Fig. 1).

4.2.3. Star/galaxy separation

The images were reduced using AIMTOOL in LMORPHO
(Odewahn 1995, Odewahn et al. 1996, 2002), and a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) driven star/galaxy separation procedure
was used to classify detected sources as: Star, Galaxy or
Unknown (for the faint, low resolution sources). Star/galaxy
separation was performed in the log(area) vs. magnitude
(SExtractor MAG ISO), which was found to robustly isolate
the stellar locus brighter than MB ≈ 17.5 in a random sample
of Schmidt plates. A typical star/galaxy separation parameter
plane from a POSS-I E image (CIG 714) is shown in Fig. 3.
The galaxies have a lower surface brightness than the stars and
in the Log(area) vs. magnitude plane, the two classes of ob-
jects fall in diﬀerent loci (Leon et al. 2000). The stellar locus
in Log(area) vs. magnitude plane was manually located using
an interactive GUI approach because the shape and location of
this locus changes signiﬁcantly on diﬀerent POSS-I Schmidt
plates. All the points that lie above the curve deﬁned by the blue
ﬁlled circles (which is described with a cubic spline) were clas-
siﬁed as Galaxy. The points below this curve were classiﬁed as
Star. Points lying outside the spline range (brighter or fainter
in magnitude than the extent of the red points) were classiﬁed
as Unknown. As a ﬁnal step, we archived our catalogues in the
form of ASCII ﬁles.

Fig. 4. Close-up view of the distribution of galaxies around CIG
714 (the bottom-right galaxy). The detected galaxies are marked
with blue ellipses, the stars are marked by red ellipses. The ob-
jects too small or to faint to be assigned a type are shown by the
green ellipses. The plate defects were removed from our object
extraction.

4.2.4. Visual checks

For a visual check, the GUI allows the user to view the image
catalogue in the form of coloured-ellipse markers over-plotted
on the DSS image (see Fig. 4). The blue ellipses indicate the
Galaxies detected, the red ones over-plot the Stars and the
green circles mark the sources that were not classiﬁed. One of
us (S. V.) systematically veriﬁed all the objects (Galaxy, Star
and Unknown) and changed the types if needed. This task was
very time consuming as the mean number of objects detected
amounted to 4000 per single 55′ × 55′ ﬁeld (up to 14 000 at low
galactic latitude). This visual quality control check was neces-
sary to reject cases of blended stellar images, which can occur
at mB < 17.5 with a non-negligible frequency, especially at in-
creasingly lower galactic latitudes (b < 45◦).

Finally, we also used POSS-II red (IIIa-F) plates of all our
Galaxy objects to perform a second check of our ﬁnal catalogues
of neighbours (55 154 stamps, visually checked by L. V.-M.).
The choice of POSS-II instead of POSS-I for this ﬁnal check
removed the detected plate defects in the POSS-I survey that
could have passed through our ﬁrst revision and provided a bet-
ter spatial resolution to distinguish compact galaxies from stars.
We summarise the results of this second visual inspection of the
Galaxy objects: 98% were conﬁrmed as Galaxy (∼ 54 000 ob-
jects), almost 2% were plate defects (1119 sources), while 0.04%
were Star (23 objects).

5. Redshifts of the catalogued neighbours

In order to evaluate the physical association of the (projected)
neighbours with the CIG galaxies, we searched for available red-
shifts in the bibliography. As explained above, Karachentseva
did not use redshifts to produce the CIG, since at that time few
of such data existed. Nowadays we are able to use more than a
dozen databases and surveys in order to search for the redshifts
and determine whether the catalogued neighbours are physically
associated with the CIG galaxies or just projected objects. We
used batch routines for all the 54 000 neighbours to access each
database, matching the coordinates within a tolerance of 6′′.

5.1. Redshift compilation

We compiled all the data coming from the various databases
(listed in the ﬁrst column of Table 2). We treated the diﬀerent
formats in order to obtain one single, homogeneous (J2000 coor-
dinates, heliocentric velocities) ﬁnal catalogue. A total of 16 126
(29.9%) objects have a redshift listed in at least one database.
The second column of Table 2 lists, for each database, the total
number of available redshifts.

The typical reported error on the velocities is about ∼
40 km s−1. For some galaxies, the redshifts were listed several
times, in various databases. The agreement is generally very
good (less than tens of km s−1) between the diﬀerent databases.
Only one redshift per neighbour was kept for the following
study. To have the most homogeneous ﬁnal database, we chose
to preferentially keep the data from the largest surveys. The
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) gave 12166 objects (75% of
the redshift sample) and besides this it gave the smallest error
and the most conﬁdent data. Next, in order, we used: the 2dF,
the CfA (velocity), NED, HyperLEDA, UZC. Because of the re-
dundancy, the UZCJ2000, CfA1, NOG4 and SSRS2 were not
used.

5.2. Classiﬁcation of neighbours

This search not only provides the redshift but also in some cases
a classiﬁcation as star/galaxy, providing a third check of our
results (see Sect. 4.2.4 for the ﬁrst and second checks). NED,
HyperLEDA, SDSS, CfA give types for the objects in their
databases, and in some cases, even when no redshift is available.
The statistical signiﬁcance of the type is improved as some ob-
jects without redshift have a determined type: the third column
of Table 2 shows the number of objects with a known type, and
the fourth column gives the percentage of Galaxy with respect
to this number. The CIG neighbours are classiﬁed as Galaxy
in more than 99.90% of the cases. These results validate our
method to separate galaxies from stars.

5.3. Catalogue of neighbourgalaxies

The parameters kept for each Galaxy were stored in the form of
ASCII catalogues; as an example, the ﬁrst lines of the catalogues
associated with CIG 1 and CIG 2 are shown in Table 3. The
entries are:

– Column 1: CIG number;
– Column 2: Neighbour number;
– Column 3: Right Ascension (Epoch J2000);
– Column 4: Declination (Epoch J2000);
– Column 5: Logarithm of the area of the galaxy (arcsec.2);
– Column 6: Apparent magnitude given by SExtractor

(MAG ISO parameter);

– Column 7: Projected distance in ′′ between the neighbour

and the associated CIG galaxy;

– Column 8: Diameter (D25) of the neighbour galaxy in ′′;
– Columns 9 & 10: Karachentseva’s criterion ﬂags, see

Sect. 6.1;

– Column 11: Recession velocity (in km s−1) of the neighbour

galaxy, when available;

– Column 12: Reference for the recession velocity: “1” refers
to SDSS, “2” to 2dF, “3” to Velo, “4” to NED, “5” to
HyperLEDA, “6” to UZC, “7” to CfA2 and “8” to NOG2.

The parameters used during the SExtraction make the diam-
eters of the detected objects about two times smaller than the ex-
pected estimation of D25, since the typical 3-sigma for a POSS-I
Schmidt plate background results in a brighter detection level of
µb ≈ 23.5 mags/sq. arcsec. In each ﬁeld, we calculated the scale
factor between the known D25 (from NED) and the SExtracted
value of the CIG diameter. We applied this scale factor to the
diameters of the neighbours in order to have an estimated value
of their true D25. When the scale factor was outside 2 σ from
the mean factor calculated with the CIG galaxies, we decided to
replace it by the mean value (equal to 2). Hence, in these ﬁelds,
the SExtracted factors of the neighbours were multiplied by 2 to
infer the values of the D25.

In Fig. 5, we show the distribution of the size of the neigh-
bour galaxies with respect to the size of the associated CIG
galaxy. Very few neighbours have a diameter larger than the di-
ameter of their associated CIG galaxy. The distribution increases
exponentially as the diameters of the neighbours get smaller:
the peak of the distribution is reached for the neighbours hav-
ing diameters of about one fourth the size of the diameter of the
associated CIG galaxy. This corresponds to the nominal factor
used by Karachentseva: the sizes of the neighbours taken into
account by Karachentseva’s isolation criterion are not equally
distributed between 0.25 and 4Dp, the vast majority of the neigh-
bours (about 88%) are at least two times smaller than their asso-
ciated CIG galaxy.

Taking also into account the neighbour galaxies having a di-
ameter less than 0.25 Dp allows us to go a step further and not
only exclude major interactions but to establish a gradient in the
degree of isolation with respect to small satellites. This will be
the subject of a further article (Verley et al. 2007, in prep.).

6. Discussion

6.1. Karachentseva’s criterion in light of available new

information

For practical reasons we could not cover ﬁelds as large as the
needed ones to fully verify Karachentseva’s criterion, but we
were still able to ﬁnd some of the CIG galaxies that failed her
criterion. According to Karachentseva, a perturbative neighbour
can be 4 times bigger and 20Di away from the CIG galaxy. This
is a huge distance: 20Di = 20 × 4Dp = 80Dp. We could only
cover this area for 74 ﬁelds: among them, 58 CIG galaxies are
isolated following Karachentseva’s criterion, while 16 are not
isolated.

Fig. 5. Distribution of the major axis of the neighbours with re-
spect to the major axis of their associated CIG galaxy. The red
dashed line represents the lower limit deﬁned by Karachentseva
to consider a neighbour as a potential perturber.

For the remaining ﬁelds, although we were not able to check
the whole 80 × Dp, we have found 284 CIG galaxies violating
Karachentseva’s isolation deﬁnition. Still, 666 CIG galaxies re-
main isolated accordingly to Karachentseva, taking into account
that we cannot assert that some of these latter galaxies will not
move from the “isolated” to the “not isolated” sample, if study-
ing a larger ﬁeld.

The majority of the neighbours (30 407 galaxies, 57.3%)
have sizes similar (within a factor of 4) to the one of their as-
sociated CIG galaxy, but only 1.4% of companions (734) are
within 20 times of their diameters away from the CIG galaxy.
We ﬁnd that 465 neighbours cumulate the two conditions, hence
violating Karachentseva’s criterion. As several of these neigh-
bours could be in the same ﬁeld around one given CIG galaxy, a
total of 284 CIG galaxies were concerned.

Two columns of Table 3 summarise these conditions:
Column 9 is “1” if the neighbour is within 20 Di and equal to
“0” if it is farther away; Column 10 is “1” if the neighbour has a

diameter similar to the one of the associated CIG galaxy (factor
4 in size) and equal to “0” otherwise. If at least one of the two
conditions is false, multiplying the last two columns, we ﬁnd
0 which means that the CIG galaxy is still isolated according to
Karachentseva’s criterion; if the two conditions are true, the mul-
tiplication gives 1: the CIG galaxy it is not isolated according to
Karachentseva’s criterion.

6.2. Redshifts

The distribution of the velocities available for the neighbour
galaxies is presented in Fig. 6. The mean recession velocity for
the neighbour galaxies is about 27 000 km s−1. Comparing this
value with the distribution of the CIG galaxies’ recession ve-
locities (Fig. 1) showing a mean at about 6624 km s−1, it appears
that the neighbour galaxies represent a deeper sample of galaxies
than the CIG. Hence, most of the neighbour galaxies are back-
ground galaxies and although some of the CIG galaxies violate
Karachentseva’s strict criterion, most of them still represent a
valuable population of isolated galaxies.

6.3. Paircandidates

As almost one third of the CIG galaxies failed Karachentseva’s
original criterion, we chose to lead a systematic study to identify
CIG galaxies possibly belonging to a pair system. The pair can-
didates are deﬁned as a CIG galaxy with at least one neighbour
(factor 2 in size with respect to Dp) within 5 × Dp. Table 4 lists
the 10 pair candidates found accordingly. The entries are:

– Column 1: CIG number and neighbour number;
– Column 2: Right Ascension (in ◦, Epoch J2000);
– Column 3: Declination (in ◦, Epoch J2000);
– Column 4: Projected distance (in ′′) from the neighbour to its

associated CIG galaxy;

– Column 5: Diameter of the galaxy (in ′′);
– Column 6: Recession velocity (when available, in km s−1) of

the galaxy.

CIG 19 has 2 neighbours nearby, one without known velocity
and one with a recession velocity very similar to the one of the
CIG galaxy: this constitutes a physical pair. Among the 4 other
pair candidates having velocity information, 3 CIG galaxies are
physically associated with their neighbours (CIGs 74, 488, 533)
while this is clearly not the case for CIG 683 (velocity diﬀerence
of ∼ 10 000 km s−1).

Unfortunately, no velocities are available for the neighbours
of the 5 remaining pair candidates (CIGs 36, 178, 233, 315, 934).
But, as four out of ﬁve pair candidates appeared to be real pairs
when the velocity is known, we can expect that, again, about
80% of the 5 pair candidates would be physically bounded.

6.4. Difference in velocity for a factor4 in size

In order to determine some of the characteristics of the neigh-
bour population considered by the Karachentseva’s criterion,
we have been able to estimate to what velocity diﬀerence the
factor 4 in size deﬁning the original isolation criterion corre-
sponds. First, we can see (Fig. 7) that the similar size (factor
4 in size with respect to the associated CIG galaxy) popula-
tion dominates up to a velocity diﬀerence of 20 000 km s−1 (the
mean value is about 17 700 km s−1). This high value for the ve-
locity diﬀerence between the neighbours and the CIG galaxies
makes the CIG a very restrictive sample compared to others

4 in size, unﬁlled histogram).

(mainly cuts at 500 or 1000 km s−1). For velocity diﬀerences
larger than 20 000 km s−1, the other sample (neighbours having
a size smaller than 0.25Dp or greater than 4Dp) dominates: the
mean value is about 25 700 km s−1.

Second, the distributions of the two samples appear mixed
due to the intrinsic recession velocity of each galaxy (the stan-
dard deviation is quite large: about 14 000 km s−1 for each sam-
ple), which is not a bijective function of the size. This indicates
that we need to take into account also the small neighbours (size
minor than 4 × Dp) that could have a velocity similar to the one
of their associated CIG galaxy and exert a noticeable inﬂuence.
A further analysis is needed to take into account this eﬀect: this
is discussed in a following paper (Verley et al. 2007, in prep.).

6.5. Difference in magnitude fora factor 4 in size

The magnitudes for the galaxies catalogued are calibrated on an
absolute scale, but it is possible to compare them to each other.
Using the magnitude diﬀerence between the neighbour galaxies
and their associated CIG galaxy removes part of the ﬂuctuation
of the zero point from one Schmidt plate to another. Allam et al.
(2005) and Xinfa et al. (2005) claim that an equivalent criterion
to Karachentseva’s one could be obtained by selecting the neigh-
bours within an interval of magnitude equal to 3 with respect to
the magnitude of the CIG galaxy, following the equation (MNeig.
and FNeig. are the magnitude and ﬂux of a given neighbour; MCIG
and FCIG the respective quantities for the CIG galaxy):

MNeig. − MCIG = −2.5 log(

FNeig.
FCIG

)

= 103/2.5 = 15.85

which is roughly equal to the square of the linear size chosen by
Karachentseva (42). In Fig. 8, we show the diﬀerence in mag-
nitudes with respect to the CIG galaxies for the neighbours that
have similar sizes to the CIG galaxies (the mean is 2 and the stan-
dard deviation 0.9) and the diﬀerence of magnitudes for the rest

of the sample (mean is 3.3 and the standard deviation is 1.2).
The overlap between the two distributions shows that a cut in
magnitude at 3 is a rather good approximation because it loses
only 10% of the neighbours selected by Karachentseva on the
basis of the linear size of 4. But the contamination also shows
that the hypothesis of ﬂat surface brightness proﬁle of galaxies
is not always true: the cut in magnitude includes a large num-
ber of galaxies not considered by Karachentseva. Hence, the two
deﬁnitions to seek for the neighbours are not fully equivalent.

7. Summary and conclusions

We have performed a systematic study to list all the projected
neighbours, down to a magnitude m ∼ 17.5, lying within
0.5 Mpc around the CIG galaxies. Our conclusions are the fol-
lowing:

1. Using automated classiﬁcation, some of the galaxies in the
CIG appear not to be isolated according to Karachentseva’s
original criterion. Nevertheless, this remains a valid sam-
ple as a starting point to obtain a reﬁned sample of isolated
galaxies. We give a ﬁrst catalogue distinguishing the isolated
CIG galaxies according to Karachentseva from those failing
the original criterion: a systematic and visual inspection of
the objects lead to about 54 000 neighbours.

2. We looked for the available redshifts of the neighbour galax-
ies in 12 databases: 30% have known velocities, and the
neighbour galaxies represent statistically a background pop-
ulation, with respect to the CIG galaxies.

3. We identiﬁed some physical pairs and pair candidates. When
a neighbour galaxy is found very near in projection from the
central CIG galaxy, its probability of being a physical com-
panion is high.

4. The factor 4 in size deﬁned in the original criterion takes into
account the majority of galaxies up to a velocity diﬀerence of
20 000 km s−1, which makes the CIG original criterion much
more restrictive than commonly used criteria which use ve-
locity diﬀerences of about 1000 km s−1.

5. Criteria based on magnitude diﬀerences to select the neigh-
bours are not fully consistent with Karachentseva’s criterion

based on the linear sizes. The discrepancy arises from the
fact that the surface brightness proﬁle of galaxies is not ﬂat,
but nevertheless they are similar criteria to a ﬁrst approxima-
tion.

6. A catalogue of the ∼ 54 000 neighbour galaxies is available
electronically at the CDS with positions, magnitudes, areas
as well as redshifts when available.
