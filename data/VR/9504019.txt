Abstract

We propose an extended quantum mechanical formalism that is based on a

wave operator ˆ̺, which is related to the ordinary density matrix via ρ = ˆ̺ˆ̺†.

This formalism allows a (generalized) unitary evolution between pure and

mixed states. It also preserves much of the connection between symmetries

and conservation laws. The new formalism is illustrated for the case of a

two level system.

Several proposals motivated by various considerations for generalizing the quantum

mechanical formalism have been made todate. In these programs one disposes of a fun-

damental quantum mechanical principle such as linearity, locality, or unitarity. Weinberg

suggested a nonlinear generalization and proposed precision tests of nonlinear corrections

to quantum mechanics [1]. Motivated by the apparent breakdown of unitarity in the black-

hole evaporation process, Hawking proposed that a synthesis of quantum mechanics and

general relativity requires giving up unitarity [2], and to some extent locality [3]. A model

which gives up both properties, was constructed by Marinov [4]. As a linear and local

phenomenological implementation of Hawking’s proposal, Ellis, Hagelin, Nanopoulos and

Srednicki (EHNS) [5], and Banks, Peskin and Susskind (BPS) [6], suggested a modiﬁed

Liouville equation for the density matrix ρ.

In particular, BPS showed that the requirements of linearity, locality in time, and

conservation of probabilities, lead to a modiﬁed equation with a “generic form”:

i¯h∂tρ = [H, ρ] + i

hnm(QmQnρ + ρQmQn −

2QnρQm),

Xn,m

(1)

Here, Qn are any Hermitian operators and hnm is c-number hermitian matrix. A suﬃcient

but not necessary condition ensuring the positivity of ρ, is that the matrix h is positive.

Equation (1) does not preserve trρ2. Thus pure states can indeed evolve to mixed states

[7].

Similar equations can be obtained from ordinary quantum mechanics for a subsystem

interacting with an environment [8]. Nevertheless, when gravity is involved one can argue

that the relevant “micro-environment” is hidden by black-hole horizons and is in principle

unobservable. This would render equation (1) a fundamental modiﬁcation of quantum

mechanics, rather then an artifact of interacting with an environment.

Modiﬁed evolutions like (1) were applied in various cases. EHNS proposed that the cor-

rections induced might be observed in the ultra-sensitive K0 −

¯K0 system. Furthermore,

1

Ellis et. al.

[9] and Huet and Peskin [10] examined the possibility that the observed CP

violation in the K0 −
rections. Related modiﬁcations where also proposed in connection with the “measurement

¯K0 system is, to some extent, due to non-quantum mechanical cor-

problem”, in order to generate a von-Neumann reduction for macroscopic systems [11, 12].

In what follows, we propose a diﬀerent approach.

It is also based on the Liouville

equation but not for the ordinary density matrix. It constitutes a linear, local, and unitary

extension of quantum mechanics. To this end, consider the density matrix in ordinary

quantum mechanics and focus ﬁrst on the case of a pure state. By analogy with the

relation ρ =

ψ

ψ

|

ih

|

, let us deﬁne the operator ˆ̺ by [13]:

If ˆ̺ satisﬁes a Liouville equation

ρ = ˆ̺ˆ̺†.

i¯h∂t ˆ̺ = [H, ˆ̺],

(2)

(3)

it is easy to see that the density matrix ρ = ˆ̺ˆ̺† also satisﬁes a Liouville equation with

the same Hamiltonian. The initial condition may be speciﬁed in terms of the “square root

operator” ˆ̺, rather than ρ. Thus, if the system is determined at t = t0 by an ordinary

complete set of measurements to be in the state

, (or ρ =

ψ0i

|

ψ0ih

ψ0|

|

), this sets the initial

condition for equation (3):

ˆ̺(t = t0) =

ψ0ih

ψ0|

.

|

(4)

Now we observe that (2) and (4) imply ρ(t = t0) = ˆ̺(t = t0), and since both quantities obey

the same equation of motion this relation holds at any subsequent time. The expectation

values of any observable A is obtained by the standard expression:

=

A
i

h

trAρ
trρ

=

trAˆ̺
trˆ̺

.

(5)

Hence eqs. (2-5) are equivalent to ordinary quantum mechanics [14].

2

It is therefore interesting to question whether eq. (3) can now be used as a new starting

point for a quantum mechanical extension. We shall assume that ˆ̺ is from now on a

general operator (not necessarily a projector) still obeying the initial condition (4), and

that expectation values are still obtained by the standard expression

=

A
i

h

trAρ
trρ

.

(6)

The density matrix however is from now on obtained via ρ = ˆ̺ˆ̺†.

The hermiticity and positivity of ρ is automatically ensured by ρ = ˆ̺ˆ̺†. We need that

the modiﬁed equation conserve probabilities, i.e, ∂ttrρ = ∂ttrˆ̺ˆ̺† = 0, but not necessarily

purity. The most general linear [15] and local generalization of eq. (3) which satisﬁes this

condition can be written as:

i¯h∂t ˆ̺ = [H, ˆ̺] + Lˆ̺ + ˆ̺R + gijKi ˆ̺K ′
j.

(7)

Here, L, R, Ki and K ′

j are any Hermitian operators, gij are real coeﬃcients, and the

summation convention was used.

Eq. (7) implies that the density matrix obeys:

i¯h∂tρ = [H + L, ρ] + gij(Ki ˆ̺K ′

j ˆ̺†

h.c.).

−

(8)

The “primary” object ˆ̺ can not be eliminated from eq. (8) which therefore cannot be

rephrased in terms of ρ only. Thus unlike the case of eq. (1), ρ plays here the role of

a “secondary” object. Eq. (8) also indicates that the term Lˆ̺ in eq. (7) gives rise to a

redeﬁnition of the Hamiltonian and that the term ˆ̺R can be eliminated. Indeed, the gauge

transformation, ˆ̺

→

ˆ̺U, where U is a unitary operator, does not aﬀect expectation values

and can be used to recast eq. (7) into the form:

i¯h∂t ˆ̺ = ˜H ˆ̺ + gijKi ˆ̺ ˜Kj,

(9)

3

where, ˜H = H + L, ˜Kj = UK ′

jU −1, and U = exp

i
(cid:20)−

R

t(R

H)dt′

(cid:21)

−

. Without the last term

this is simply a Schr¨odinger-like equation for the operator ˆ̺.

To further analyze eq. (7) we construct a Hilbert space. It is deﬁned as the linear space

of solutions of eq. (7) with all possible initial conditions at any t0. With the inner

ˆ̺
}

L ≡ {
product deﬁned as:

ˆ̺1, ˆ̺2i

h

= trˆ̺†

1 ˆ̺2,

(10)

becomes a Hilbert space. It follows from eq. (7) that this inner product is conserved and

L
hence the generalized dynamics suggested here manifests in

as a unitary evolution. The

L

inner product (10) may be regarded as an extension of the ordinary quantum mechanical

inner product. If the corrections induced after t = t0 by the new terms in the evolution

eq. (7) are small,

ˆ̺1, ˆ̺2i ≃ |h

ψ1|

ψ2i|

h

2. Note also that expression (6) for the expectation

value of of an observable A can be now re-expressed as:

A
i

h

ˆ̺, Aˆ̺
i
ˆ̺, ˆ̺
i

= h
h

.

(11)

Equations (7,9), and (10-11) suggest that ˆ̺ should be interpreted as a generalized “wave

operator”. The new feature here however, is that trρ2 = tr(ˆ̺ˆ̺†)2 is not conserved. This

manifests the new aspects of our unitary evolution as transition between pure and mixed

density matrices (ρ).

The generalized unitarity, namely the conservation of the inner product (10), can be

clariﬁed by rewriting eq. (7) in the Hilbert space

. For simplicity let us consider a system

L

with a ﬁnite, N-dimensional, Hilbert space and perform the extension described above.

The extended, N 2 dimensional, Hilbert space

can be spanned by a hermitian basis of

L

N 2

−

1 SU(N) matrices and the unit operator:

ˆ̺ =

1
√2

(̺01 + ̺iTi),

4

(12)

where Ti are SU(N) generators and ̺a are N 2 complex numbers. In this basis, the gener-

alized inner product between any two solutions is given by an ordinary vector product in

a N 2-dimensional Hilbert space:

ˆ̺1, ˆ̺2i

h

=

N 2−1

Xa=0

̺∗
1a̺2a.

We can also express eq. (7) in this basis as a Schr¨odinger-like equation:

i¯h∂t̺a =

Hab̺b = (

(qm)
ab + δ

H

Hab)̺b.

(13)

(14)

The condition for conservation of probabilities (and unitarity) is simply that the gener-

alized Hamiltonian,

Hab, is hermitian. The deceptive similarity of eq. (14) and ordinary
quantum mechanics Schr¨odinger equation in an N 2 dimensional space notwithstanding, we

emphasis that the only relevant, physical degrees of freedom are in those of the original

(N dimensional) Hilbert space.

Next we would like to express the observables Ai as hermitian operators in

. In general

L

we have in

L

N 4 independent hermitian operators. Therefore the mapping

Ai → Ai ∈ OL

(15)

of the original (N 2) observables Ai into the set of hermitian operators

OL in

L

is not one

to one. This mapping is constrained by demanding that

trAi ˆ̺ˆ̺† =

N 2−1

N 2−1

Xa=0

Xb=0

̺a(

Ai)ab̺b,

(16)

i.e., that

A
i

h

is expressible in

L

as a “standard” expectation value with respect to the

“amplitudes” ˆ̺a. We also require that the mapping (15) preserves commutation relations.

Therefore, an N-dimensional representation of SU(N) is mapped into an N 2 dimensional

representation of SU(N) in

servable Ai = ci01 + ciaTa to

OL, Ti → Ti. The linear transformation maps a general ob-
Ai ∈ OL still has the

+

a ciaTa. The operator

same eigenvalues as the original operator Ai. However all the eigenvalues are now N-fold

degenerate. Another set of operators, denoted by

Ai
do not correspond to observables. It can be shown that the role of the new terms in eq.

Dj, which remove the degeneracy of

(7) or δ

H

in eq. (14) is to generate correlations between

Ai and

Dj, which in turn induces

the transition to a mixed density matrix.

It was noted by Gross [16] and by Ellis et. al.

[5], that linear modiﬁcations of the

evolution laws for the density matrix (e.g. eq. (1)) generally breaks the one to one corre-

spondence between symmetries and conservation laws. We now show that in the present

formalism, this correspondence is partially restored. An observable

A ∈ OL that is a
/¯h)

iǫ

−
generates a sym-

A

constant of motion satisﬁes:

[

,

A

H

] = 0. Hence the unitary operator T = exp(

commutes with the unitary evolution operator U = exp(

it

/¯h), and

metry in

. The converse is not generally true. Since

L
hermitian operators in

L
OL may be mapped back to hermitian operators in the original N-
generates a symmetry

dimensional Hilbert space. Therefore, if some hermitian operator

−

H
is N 2-dimensional, not all the

A

G

in

L

and its expectation value, ̺∗

a(t)

Gab̺b(t), is conserved, it still may not correspond to

an observable.

To illustrate the general discussion above let us consider as an example the simple two

level system (e.g. a spin half particle in a constant magnetic ﬁeld). The mapping between

the original 2-d Hilbert space and the 4-d Hilbert space

will be spelled out in detail. Let

L

the “free” Hamiltonian be given by

H = E0 +

1
2

¯hωσ3.

(17)

We have seen that the terms Lˆ̺ and ˆ̺R in eq. (7) can be absorbed by a redeﬁnition of H

and K ′

j. Therefore, the modiﬁed eq. will be taken as:

i¯h∂t ˆ̺ = [H, ˆ̺] + K ˆ̺K ′,

(18)

6

where K and K ′ are functions of the Pauli matrices, and will be assumed to be time

independent. Energy conservation, ∂

∂t h

= ∂
∂t

hˆ̺,H ˆ̺i
hˆ̺,ˆ̺i = 0, implies that [σ3, K] = 0, hence

H

i

K = σ3. This leaves three unknown parameters which determine K ′:

K ′ = ασ1 + βσ2 + λσ3.

The present model diﬀers qualitatively from the model of BPS or EHNS: while eq.

(1) yields in general exponentially decaying (or exponentially increasing) solutions, our

modiﬁcations are oscillatory. Indeed the general solution of equation (14) is

̺a =

cµ̺µa exp(

Xµ=0,3

iλat),

−

(22)

7

where λα and ̺aα are the (real) eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively, of

Hab.

As an example consider the special case where only λ in eq. (20) is non-vanishing, and

the spin is found at t = t0 in the state

ψ0i

= cos η

2 | ↑ˆzi

+ sin η

2 | ↓ˆzi

. The solution in this

case is given by

ˆ̺(t) = 

2 sin(η)ei(ω+λ)t

1

2 sin(η)e−i(ω−λ)t
sin2(η/2)e−iλt



.



(23)

The resulting density matrix, ρ = ˆ̺ˆ̺†, oscillates periodically between a pure and mixed

state. For example in the simple case η = π/2

ρ(t) =

1





(24)

and trρ2 = 1

2 + 1

2 cos2(2λt).

Observable eﬀects due to these modiﬁcations can in principle be searched for in neutron

interferometry experiments [17]. In such interference experiments, one typically measures

an observable of the form

A(θ) =

1

e−iθ

1
2





eiθ



(25)

where θ is determined by the experimental set up. The expectation value of A is given in

our case by

The correction is indeed oscillatory. This should be contrasted with the exponential

exp(

2λEN HSt) decay of the interference obtained by EHNS.

What are the present experimental bounds pertinent to the three new parameters of the

two level system? We can use the two slit experiments of Zeilinger et. al. [18] with a 20A0

neutron beam, and the analysis of Pearle [19], to constrains the generic parameter λ to

10(sec)−1

parameters in the EHNS model is

We found that our modiﬁcation induces KL KS mixing generating CP violation in the

¯K0 system in a similar fashion as in the EHNS model. However, this mixing

two level K0 −
predicts a phase of the CP violating parameter ǫ, which is of by π/2 just as in the case

of the EHNS model [10]. Hence our modiﬁcation can account only for a small part of the

CP violation observed in the K0 −

¯K0 system. This leads to the generic upper bound of

K/Mpl which could be expected on dimensional

grounds if CP and/or CPT violations are due to eﬀects of quantum gravity. The hundred

fold larger parameter allowed by the neutron interference experiment in our model could be

important. In particular this renders smaller yet experimentally detectable CPT violations,

more likely in the present framework.

We have constructed a formalism based on an operator generalization of the wave

function which is linear, local, and unitary. As a consistency check of this proposal we note

that to some extent the proposed formalism can be embedded in the framework of ordinary

quantum mechanics. We can interpret ˆ̺ˆ̺† and ˆ̺† ˆ̺ as the reduced density matrices of a sub-

system and an environment, respectively. The generalized Hamiltonian

Hab in eq. (14) and
the amplitudes ̺a can then be interpreted as the Hamiltonian and wave function of the total

system, while the new terms in eq. (7,9) or (14) as describing an interaction between the

sub-system and the environment. Therefore, the consistency of the proposed equation of

motion follows from quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, postulate (4), ˆ̺(t = t0) =

ψ0|
which sets the initial condition for eq. (7) goes beyond any ordinary quantum mechanical

scheme. It would amount in quantum mechanics to an additional requirement that after

9

carrying a complete set of measurements on the sub-system, the wave function of the

environment becomes identical to that of the system. This additional constraint is not

satisﬁed in quantum mechanics. Therefore the predictions of this formalism will generally

diﬀer from that of a quantum mechanical system with an environment [20].

Finally, we note that the proposed formalism may also be relevant to the information

problem in black hole evaporation and to the measurement problem. In the latter case, for

large systems the modiﬁed evolution might under appropriate conditions give rise to loss

of coherence which amounts to a measurement.

[20] Although the oscillatory corrections found in the two-level system are common also in

the case of a coupling with some environment, the two cases are distinguishable. The

modiﬁed equation of motion of the two-level model under consideration can be mapped

to an ordinary quantum mechanics spin half sub-system which is coupled to another

spin half (the environment). The interaction term is then given by Hint = λσ1
