Abstract We present the results of a study of spectral features and the velocity ﬁeld in the at-
mosphere and the circumstellar envelope of the hypergiant V1302 Aql, the optical counterpart of
the IR source IRC+10420, based on high-resolution spectroscopic observations obtained in 2001–
2014. We measured radial velocities of the following types of lines: forbidden and permitted pure
emissions, absorption and emission components of lines of ions, pure absorptions (e.g., He i, Si ii),
and interstellar components of the Na i D–lines, K i, and DIBs. The heliocentric radial velocity
measured for pure absorptions as well as for the forbidden and permitted pure emissions is close
to the systemic radial velocity and equal to Vr = 63.7±0.3, 65.2±0.3, and 62.0±0.4 km s−1, respec-
tively. Positions of the absorption components of the lines with inverse P Cyg proﬁles are stable
and indicate the presence of clumps moving toward the star with a velocity of ∼20 km s−1. The
average radial velocity of the DIBs is Vr(DIB) = 4.6±0.2 km s−1. Comparison of the absorption
lines observed in 2001–2014 and those in earlier data shows no noticeable variations. We conclude
that the hypergiant reached a phase of slowing down (or termination) of the eﬀective temperature
growth and is currently located near the high-temperature boundary of the Yellow Void in the
Hertszprung-Russell diagramme.

1. Introduction

The evolutionary status of a very luminous star V1302 Aql, the optical counterpart of the IR source
IRC+10420, has been unclear. The variety of its properties allowed to classify it either as a Proto-
Planetary Nebulae (PPN) [1] or as a very massive star that has passed through the red supergiant
phase [2]. PPNe are currently thought to be low-mass peculiar supergiants with strong IR excesses
in a short-term transition from the Asymptotic Giant Branch to the Planetary Nebula (PN) stage.
They are descendants of intermediate-mass stars (initial masses 1–8 M⊙) which have passed several
evolutionary stages, including switching energy sources and stages with typical mass loss rates up
to 10−5 M⊙ yr−1 and even up to 10−4 M⊙ yr−1. As a result, a PPN is a low-mass degenerate C–O
core surrounded by a tenuous and usually an asymmetric envelope. As the core contracts, its eﬀective
temperature (Teﬀ ) rises and the star moves blueward in the Hertsprung-Russell diagramme (hereafter
HRD). This stage may last until Teﬀ reaches ∼30000 K, when ionisation of the circumstellar envelope
begins. At this time, the object is observed as a PN after hydrogen recombination lines and forbidden
lines of light elements show up in its spectrum. Luminosity of low-mass supergiants at the PPN stage
may reach log L/L⊙ ∼ 4.5 [3].

Yellow supergiants are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from PPNe, although a number of properties (high
luminosity, spectral features, presence of circumstellar envelopes) are similar in these two classes of
object. Predecessors of the former are massive (initial mass ≥ 20 M⊙) and the most luminous stars,

which lose a signiﬁcant part of their mass after leaving main-sequence, become red supergiants, and
later proceed to yellow supergiants. A typical luminosity of a yellow supergiant is log L/L⊙ ∼ 5.3–
5.9 [2]. These objects are located near the Eddington limit in an instability region which contains
hypergiants of spectral types from A to M [4, 5]. Wolf-Rayet stars and Luminous Blue Variables
may be their descendants [6]. Structured circumstellar envelopes of hypergiants formed during several
phases of a strong stellar wind with mass loss rates of 10−4 − 10−3 M⊙ yr−1 are sources of IR and
maser radiation as well as of numerous molecular emission lines. Nevertheless, the yellow hypergiant
ρ Cas, nearest to V1302 Aql in HRD and possessing an extended and unstable atmosphere [7], shows
no signs of circumstellar material [8].

Obviously, depending on the adopted nature and hence luminosity of an object, its distance estimate
may diﬀer by a factor of a few. However, data obtained during the last two decades from various
observations leave no doubts that V1302 Aql is an object at the yellow hypergiant stage (see review by
Oudmaijer et al. [6]) as well as later papers [9, 10]. Moreover, V1302 Aql is now considered to be the
most unambiguous massive Galactic object with a highest mass loss rate which undergoes a short-term
evolutionary transition from a red supergiant to a Wolf-Rayet star [11]. One of the most compelling
arguments conﬁrming its high-luminosity massive star status has been derived from spectroscopic
data obtained at the 6 m telescope of the Russian Academy of Sciences, when the authors [12] found a
signiﬁcant nitrogen excess in the atmosphere of V1302 Aql. In all the spectra obtained between 1997
and 2000, a He i 5876 ˚A lines with a large equivalent width of ≥200 m˚A was detected. With the object’s
Teﬀ ∼9200 K, such an equivalent width can be a consequence of a high luminosity and an enhanced
helium abundance in its atmosphere [13, 14].

Interest to V1302 Aql has been growing in the last decade due to detection of a 120 K a year Teﬀ
increase [12, 14, 15, 16] that allowed to suggest evolution toward the Wolf-Rayet stage. Humphreys et
al. [17] points out that V1302 Aql is a post red supergiant star which is crossing a critical HRD region
called the Yellow Void [18].

The Teﬀ increase stimulates us to continue spectroscopic monitoring of this mysterious object. High-
resolution spectroscopy is required to reﬁne the structure and kinematics of its circumstellar envelope.
The most adequate model to represent the observed kinematics is, in our opinion, the “rain” model
proposed by Humphreys et al. [17] even considering a bipolar model suggested later [10]. Observations
with a moderate spectral resolving power, R ∼ 8000, were obtained by Humphreys et al. [17] to test
the model. We obtained spectra with a much higher resolution (up to R ∼ 60000) that allows us to
better constrain the line proﬁles and measure their parameters with a much higher accuracy.

In this paper, we present the results of a new stage of a spectroscopic monitoring of V1302 Aql
in continuation of our study of this object [12, 14]. In Section 2 we describe our spectroscopic data,
Section 3 is devoted to discussion of the results, while Section 6 summarizes the conclusions.

2. Observational Data

We have added 16 new spectra to our collection of the V1302 Aql data in 2001–2014. The observing
dates and data spectral ranges are listed in the ﬁrst two columns of Table 1. Most spectra were obtained
with the ´echelle spectrograph NES with spectral resolution R = 60000 [19, 20]. Our ﬁrst spectrum
obtained on 2001 August 9 was taken with the spectrograph LYNX 1K×1K CCD, R ∼ 25000 [21].
One-dimensional data were extracted from 2D ´echelle spectra using the ECHELLE context in MIDAS
modiﬁed to features of the spectrographs used (see details in [22]). Cosmic particles were removed by
median averaging of two consecutive spectra. Wavelength calibration of the spectra was derived using
a Th-Ar hollow cathode lamp.

One of the spectra used in this paper was obtained at the McDonald Observatory on 2009 September
11 with the ´echelle spectrograph TS2 R = 60000 [23] in the coud´e focus of the 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith
telescope. This allowed us to ﬁll the gap in observations with the 6 m telescope for 2009. One-
dimensional data for this spectrum were extracted using the apall task within the echelle package
in IRAF. In particular, the spectral range of this observation allowed us to study proﬁles of the strong
lines of Ca ii 8408 ˚A and 8542 ˚A in the near IR region, which is not covered by the 6 m telescope data.

The remaining part of the data reduction, including measurements of the lines intensities and
positions, was done with the latest version of the DECH20t package [24]. This package, traditionally
used in our studies, permits radial velocity measurements for individual features of complex line
proﬁles. Only heliocentric radial velocities, Vr, are used throughout this paper. Their systematic errors
do not exceed 1 km s−1 for a single line. The latter can be seen in the last column of Table 1, where
Vr of the saturated interstellar components of the Na i D–lines are listed. Features in the spectrum of
V1302 Aql were identiﬁed using an earlier published atlas [25].

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Spectral type of V1302 Aql in 2001–2014

Earlier spectroscopic observations of V1302 Aql revealed a gradual transition from a normal F–type
supergiant [26] to an A5–type one [14]. The new spectral type estimates for 2001–2014 based on our
technique presented in [12, 14] give the following results. Pure absorption lines in the blue part of the
spectrum indicate a spectral type A6, while inclusion of criteria using He i and Si ii absorptions leads
to A3.5. Therefore we conclude that the current spectral type coincides with that derived in [12, 14]
within the uncertainties and that the objects Teﬀ does not grow anymore.

3.2. Line proﬁles in the spectrum of V1302 Aql in 2001–2014

As earlier, line proﬁles in the spectra of V1302 Aql vary from purely absorption with small deviations
from symmetry to P Cyg–type proﬁles and double-peaked emissions. Examples of these line proﬁles
are shown in Fig. 1. Variations of the intensities and proﬁles for the last 20 years taking into account
results from [12, 14, 17] are noticeable but small.

Hydrogen lines Hα and Hβ in 2001–2014 still have a characteristic double-peaked proﬁle, which was
observed in the 1990’s see Fig. 5 in [14]. Positions of both emission peaks and the central depression
have not changed since then. Variations of the residual intensities of the emission components of both
lines remained within 40%. The Hα proﬁles in two spectra are shown in Fig. 2.

A typical peak intensity ratio for the entire 20-year long period is seen in the spectrum taken in
2014. An unusual Hα line proﬁle, when the red peak is signiﬁcantly stronger than the blue one, is

detected in only one spectrum taken on 2007 November 24. In all other spectra the peak intensity ratio
is the opposite [14, 17]. Variations of the residual intensities of the strongest forbidden and permitted
Fe ii lines are even weaker (within 10%). In the last 7 spectra taken in 2012–2014 they are limited to
20% and 6%, respectively.

3.3. Radial velocities of various features in 2001–2014

According to [15], the average radial velocity of several rotational bands of the CO molecule with
respect to the local standard of rest is V(LSR) = 77 km s−1. The heliocentric systemic radial velocity
of the object is Vsys ∼ 60 km s−1. Humphreys et al. [17] determined Vsys = 58 − 60 km s−1 using a
combination of CO and OH bands. We note that the latter is also close to the velocities derived from
radio lines of other molecules (see [28] and references therein).

The relative stability of the spectrum of V1302 Aql in recent time and homogeneity of the obtained
material allowed us to move from reporting the variety of the spectral line shapes to following a

gradual transformation between diﬀerent shapes. Comparison of Figs. 1 and 3 with the data from
Table 1 convinces that such a transformation is real. The proﬁles shown in Fig. 1 are averaged from
the spectra taken in 2012–2014. A typical example of relationships between the radial velocities for
individual lines and their residual intensities is shown in Fig. 3. The same proﬁle types follow each
other from top to bottom in Fig. 1 and from left to right in Fig. 3 and in Table 1.

Variations of the average radial velocities of various line groups (see Table 1) are small as well. In
particular, all the radial velocities for the pure absorptions are in a range of 54–70 km s−1. Forbidden
lines are asymmetric (see Fig. 1a), such as the peak intensity is red-shifted with respect to the lower
part of the proﬁle by 6 km s−1 on average. The [Ca ii](1F) 7291 and 7324 ˚A emissions seen in our
spectra taken on 2009 September 11 and 2014 October 4 are much stronger that all other forbidden
lines but with no positional shift with respect to the latter. Radial velocities of the entire proﬁles and
their peaks are presented in Fig. 3a by circles and dots, respectively. The averaged radial velocities,
measured from lower parts of the forbidden line proﬁles, are listed in column 3 of Table 1.

Permitted emissions of the iron group are noticeably wider than the forbidden lines. For example, at
the same residual intensity of 1.5, the half-widths at the zero level are 70 and 50 km s−1, respectively.
The iron lines are clearly double-peaked with a weaker blue-shifted peak (see Fig. 1b). The radial
velocities of the lower parts of these emission proﬁles (in the same way as for the forbidden lines), are
shown in column 4 of Table 1 and represented by circles in Fig. 3b. The emission peak velocities are
shown by dots in the same Figure. The peak separation decreases from 50 km s−1 for weak emissions
to 26 km s−1 for the strongest ones, where it even reaches a triangular shape. It seems that the double-
peaked proﬁles are not just a sum of two narrower single-peaked emissions separated by 50 km s−1,
but that a partially ﬁlled absorption component formed in the stellar atmosphere also takes part in
the overall proﬁle formation.

It is seen in Figs. 1bc that a gradually deepening absorption “pushes down” the central part of the
proﬁle and eventually turns it into an inverse P Cyg–type proﬁle. Line proﬁles may have this kind of
shape in the following cases: when a narrow circumstellar absorption overlaps with a wide circumstellar
emission or when two narrower emissions with diﬀerent radial velocities join together. The inner slopes
would be shallower than the outer ones in the latter case. We observe steeper inner slopes instead,
therefore the emission components are separated by an absorption. It is possible to have a combination
of these two formation mechanisms as well as a double–ray version suggested in [10].

There a many lines with emission components on both sides of the absorption in the spectrum of
V1302 Aql. We include in the group of lines with an inverse P Cyg–proﬁle those with the continuum
above the absorption core, r <1. If the central depression is seen at r >1, the line is considered to have
a double-peaked proﬁle. Column 5 of Table 1 contains the average radial velocities for blue-shifted

emission and absorption components in the group of lines with P Cyg–proﬁles. Both such components
are shown by circles in Fig. 3c (an absorption asymmetry is shown for the strongest ones). The red-
shifted components are weaker (r <1.1) than the blue-shifted ones with an average radial velocity of
130±10 km s−1 in our spectra.

The proﬁles in Fig. 1 diﬀer from classic P Cyg–proﬁles which represent a spherically-symmetric
envelope with a radial velocity gradient. The latter show a relationship between the emission compo-
nent intensity and the absorption component depth. However the weakest absorptions in our proﬁles
(r <0.95) may be accompanied by blue-shifted emissions with any intensity in a range 1.0 < r < 1.4,
while the strongest absorptions (r ∼0.4) are seen with the weakest ones (r <0.15). This is seen in
Fig. 3 where the leftmost ﬁlled circles of the lower chain correspond to the leftmost (not the rightmost!)
circles of the upper chain.

The line proﬁles that are totally located below the continuum make the group of absorptions.
However, some of these lines, such as Fe ii (37,38), Ti ii (31), Cr ii, may have hidden outside emission
components, because their wings are narrower than those of Si ii and Mg ii with similar depths. Fig. 3d
shows the uncertain absorption group members by ﬁlled circles, while more reliable ones are shown
by open circles. In turn, we consider the most pure absorptions are the weakest ones, such as Si ii
(4,5) and He i 5876 ˚A (the left subgroup of the open circles in Fig. 3d). The average radial velocities
for the latter lines are given in column 6 of Table 1. A standard deviation for the pure absorption and
emissions is σ ≤ 0.4 km s−1 and σ = 0.2 km s−1 for the interstellar features.

Closeness of the radial velocities seen in Fig. 3 is noticeable in the following line groups:

– iron absorption lines in the blue part of the spectrum and absorption components of the lines with
inverse P Cyg–proﬁles (averaging all our data gives 81 and 80 km s−1, respectively). We consider
stable positions of the latter as an indicator of a matter infall;

– strong Si ii (2) absorptions (they are shown by a pair of open circles in Fig. 3d) and absorption
components of the Hα and Hβ lines (average radial velocities are 73 and ∼70 km s−1, respectively);

– the weakest absorptions and forbidden emissions (63.7 and 65.2 km s−1, respectively). Since the
former form in the deepest layers of the photosphere (or pseudo-photosphere) while the latter form
in an extended envelope, it is natural that the radial velocity of the latter is the closest to that of
the star’s center of mass, i.e. Vsys ∼ 60 km s−1.

The dotted line shows the Fe ii 5316 ˚A line proﬁle in the spectrum of V1302 Aql. Spectra of both stars

4. Interstellar features in the spectrum of V1302 Aql
Fig. 4 shows a complex proﬁle of the D1–line of a resonance Na i doublet. The mail part of its absorption
component forms in a cold interstellar gas in the line of sight, while a weaker red-shifted component
forms in the atmosphere of V1302 Aql. The latter is well reproduced by the absorption component of
the Fe ii 5316 ˚A line, and both can apparently be classiﬁed as lines with inverse P Cyg–proﬁles.

The main part of the Na i D–line proﬁle in a range of Vr = −25 − +50 km s−1 has interstellar
nature. As follows from a recent compilation of the data on the structure and kinematics of the Milky
Way [27], radial velocity in the direction of V1302 Aql increases with distance and reaches +50 km s−1
at a distance D = 5.3 kpc. Fig. 4 shows the Na i D1–line proﬁle in the spectrum of the B–type hypergiant
HD 183143, which is projectionally close to V1302 Aql (the Galactic coordinates l/b = 53.◦2/0.◦6 and
47.◦1/ − 2.◦5, respectively). However, as seen in Fig. 1 in [28], HD 183143 is located between the local
and Carina–Norma spiral arms, while the line of sight to V1302 Aql passes through the latter arm
between 3 and 8 kpc. Therefore, a distance toward HD 183143 is ∼2 kpc [29], and V1302 Aql is located
signiﬁcantly further away. Coincidence of the red boundary of the interstellar Na i absorption and
the maximum of above mentioned Vr(D) relationship indicates that V1302 Aql cannot be closer than
5.3 kpc. Its spectroscopic parallax moves it even further away to 6.5–8.0 kpc.

The K i 7665 ˚A line proﬁle shown in Fig. 4 also represents a combination of stellar and interstellar
components. The interstellar components are less saturated compared to those of the Na i D–lines and
split into three components. The weakest of them at Vr ∼ −10 km s−1 corresponds to the blue-shifted
component of the Na i D1 line (Fig. 4), while the other two at Vr ∼ 8 and 24 km s−1 are merged in the
Na i proﬁle. The stellar absorption component is located at Vr ∼ 84 km s−1. As clearly seen in Fig. 4,
the K i 7665 ˚A line proﬁle also has an emission component, whose position at Vr ∼ 84 km s−1 indicates
that it forms in the circumstellar envelope.

Using our large high-quality material, we measured positions of some diﬀuse interstellar band (DIB).
A list of those reliably identiﬁable in the spectrum of V1302 Aql was published in [25]. Note two
important points concerning the search and measurement of the DIB positions:

– the number of DIBs with measured Vr varies from one spectrum to another (from 5 to 17 features);

– the individual DIBs Vr diﬀer systematically.

The latter was mentioned by Oudmaijer [16], who has identiﬁed many DIBs in the object’s spectrum.
Over 30 of them are narrow and have equivalent widths of ≥20 m˚A. The author explained a large scatter
of the measured Vr (from 5 to 40 km s−1) by uncertain DIB wavelengths.

The last column of Table 1 lists average Vr for each of the observing dates in 2001–2014 of a small
group of the narrowest and most symmetric DIBs which show the smallest diﬀerential shifts. Their
standard wavelengths (5796.97, 5849.82, 6195.96, 6376.00, and 6379.24 ˚A) are taken from [30]. After
such a selection, the average Vr for all the dates came to 4.6±0.2 km s−1.

5. Closest analogs of the hypergiant V1302 Aql

In Sect. 1 we mentioned ρ Cas, a well-studied yellow hypergiant with a luminosity similar to that
of V1302 Aql. In particular, optical spectra of ρ Cas and a complex structure of its atmosphere and
envelope have been recently studied in detail [7, 31]. However if all features are taken into account,
the optical counterpart of the IR-source IRAS 18357−0604 turns out to be closer to V1302 Aql. Since
this object is very reddened, not much data have been published for it. Recently authors [32] took a
spectrum of IRAS 18357−0604 in the red and IR regions, estimated its distance D ∼6 kpc using its
systemic velocity, classiﬁed it an early A–type star, and concluded on a similarity of its spectrum
to that of V1302 Aql. The spectrum of IRAS 18357−0604 is dominated by asymmetric emissions of
low-excitation transitions, such as H i, N i, Fe i, Fe ii, Ti ii, [Fe ii], etc. According to these authors, line
proﬁle features of IRAS 18357−0604 indicate an asymmetry of its outﬂowing envelope. However unlike
in the spectrum of V1302 Aql, red-shifted components of broad double-peaked proﬁles of H i, Ca ii,
and N i in the spectrum of IRAS 18357−0604 are stronger than blue-shifted ones.

A bright star HR 8752, the optical counterpart of the IR source IRAS 22579+5640, is also a member
of the yellow hypergiants group. It is located much closer to the Sun compared to V1302 Aql, and
it is easier to study its features. HR 8752 is listed as a standard of MK–classiﬁcation with a spectral
type G0 Ia [33]. However comparing high-resolution spectra taken in 1973–1977, authors [34] have
detected a growth of its Teﬀ. The same authors studied kinematic properties of the star’s atmosphere
and envelope in detail and noted signs of a matter infall onto the star with a speed of 30 km s−1.
Later, based on a set of optical spectra of HR 8752 obtained with various instruments in 1973–2005,
Nieuwenhuijzen et al. [35] have analysed these data using a homogeneous approach. Adding data from
even a longer photometric monitoring, they restored temporal variations of the star’s fundamental
parameters, such as Teﬀ, luminosity, radius, color-index B − V , etc. One of their main results is a
conclusion about a gradual growth of Teﬀ from log Teﬀ = 3.65 circa 1900 to log Teﬀ = 3.90 in 2000.
Therefore, HR 8752 is the closest analog of V1302 Aql based on all features. At the same time, HR 8752
seems to have a lower mass compared to that of V1302 Aql judging on the HRD position [35].

Comparison of the spectral line proﬁles in our spectra of V1302 Aql in 2001–2014 indicates the
absence of a noticeable spectral variability, thus allowing to conclude that the hypergiant entered a
phase of a slow down (or termination) of the Teﬀ growth and approached the Yellow Void boundary,
which is called the White Wall [10]. Earlier authors [36] suspected stabilization of the star’s Teﬀ based
on a long-term photometric monitoring. New evolutionary loops may follow this episode, such as that
observed for HR 8752 on a timescale of 10 years [18]. Therefore, it seems very important to continue
monitoring of V1302 Aql.

6. Conclusions

Using a set of high-resolution spectra of V1302 Aql obtained in 2001–2014, we measured intensities
and positions of various spectral features that allowed us to analyse the proﬁle behaviour with time
as well as the velocity ﬁeld in various layers of the object’s extended atmosphere and its circumstellar
envelope. We concluded on a closeness of the Vr for the iron absorption lines in the blue spectral part
and absorption components with inverse P Cyg–proﬁles. Positions of the latter features that reﬂects
clumps falling onto the star with a velocity of ∼20 km s−1 has been stable for all the observing dates.
The position of the strong Si ii (2) absorptions and absorption components of the Hα and Hβ lines
varied insigniﬁcantly around 63.7 and 70.5 km s−1, respectively.

The Vr for the weakest absorptions, which form in the deepest observable photospheric (or pseudo-
photospheric) layers, and for the forbidden emissions, which form in an extended envelope (63.7 and
65.2 km s−1, respectively). The average Vr of the permitted emissions also weakly deviates from that

of the pure absorptions. It is equal to 62.0 km s−1 for all the observing dates. The average Vr of the
interstellar features is equal to 4.6±0.2 km s−1.

Comparison of the features in the spectra of V1302 Aql in 2001–2014 indicates the absence of a
noticeable variability. We conclude that the hypergiant entered a phase of a slow down (or termination)
of the Teﬀ growth and approached the high-temperature boundary of the Yellow Void.
