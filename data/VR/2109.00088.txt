ABSTRACT

Despite extensive searches and the relative proximity of solar system objects (SSOs) to Earth, many
remain undiscovered and there is still much to learn about their properties and interactions. This
work is the ﬁrst in a series dedicated to detecting and analyzing SSOs in the all-sky NOIRLab Source
Catalog (NSC). We search the ﬁrst data release of the NSC with CANFind, a Computationally Au-
tomated NSC tracklet Finder. NSC DR1 contains 34 billion measurements of 2.9 billion unique ob-
jects, which CANFind categorizes as belonging to “stationary” (distant stars, galaxies) or moving
(SSOs) objects via an iterative clustering method. Detections of stationary bodies for proper motion
µ ≤2.5(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(0.017◦day−1) are identiﬁed and analyzed separately. Remaining detections belonging to
high-µ objects are clustered together over single nights to form “tracklets”. Each tracklet contains de-
tections of an individual moving object, and is validated based on spatial linearity and motion through
time. Proper motions are then calculated and used to connect tracklets and other unassociated mea-
surements over multiple nights by predicting their locations at common times, forming “tracks”. This
method extracted 527,055 tracklets from NSC DR1 in an area covering 29,971 square degrees of the
sky. The data show distinct groups of objects with similar observed µ in ecliptic coordinates, namely
Main Belt Asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and Kuiper Belt Objects. Apparent magnitudes range from
10–25 mag in the ugrizY and VR bands. Color-color diagrams show a bimodality of tracklets between
primarily carbonaceous and siliceous groups, supporting prior studies.

1. INTRODUCTION

Although the sky has been extensively searched for
solar system objects (SSOs) over the last few hundred
years, new bodies are still being found today. Long
before the ﬁrst discovery of an asteroid (Ceres) at the
Palermo Observatory in 1801 (Cunningham et al. 2009)
until as recently as 1991, the process of identifying SSOs
depended entirely on the human eye. Through the ori-
gin of astronomical surveys speciﬁcally intended for SSO
detection, and later the addition of charge-coupled de-
vices (CCDs) for astronomy purposes by the Spacewatch
Telescope at the Steward Observatory (Gehrels 1991),
SSOs were spotted either by direct observation or by
“blinking” between physical exposures of the sky in a
lengthy process. This changed when Rabinowitz (1991)
created the ﬁrst automated method used for detecting

Earth-approaching asteroids in near real time using the
Spacewatch Telescope. With sequential exposures taken
by the telescope, the detection software identiﬁed trails
that moving objects (MOs) left in the ﬁrst two expo-
sures, and displacements between them and a third ex-
posure. This new method of MO detection marked the
beginning of a striking growth in the rate of asteroid
discovery, and of our knowledge of the solar system.

SSOs fall into categories based on their orbital pa-
rameters and composition, called “groups” and “fam-
ilies”. While groups have similar orbits, families are
more closely related as they often consist of fragments
from past collisions. Distinct to us by their high proper
motion and perihelia ≤ 1.3 AU, Near Earth Objects
(NEOs) are potential impactors due to their proximity.
It wasn’t until 2008 that the ﬁrst detection of an asteroid
before its impact was made by the Catalina Sky Survey
(CSS, Boattini et al. 2009). Various organizations and
warning systems like the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact
Last Alert System (ATLAS, Tonry et al. 2018) are ded-
icated to the NEO search, as even a relatively small

asteroid has the potential for mass destruction (Dear-
born et al. 2020) and lasting eﬀects on the Earth’s en-
vironment (Marchi et al. 2019; Koeberl & Ivanov 2019).
To address the problem, in 1991 the Spaceguard Sur-
vey Network was established by NASA in response to
direction from the United Stated Congress to increase
the detection rate of asteroids which cross Earth’s or-
bit (Morrison 1992). Spaceguard has led to a signiﬁcant
increase in surveys dedicated to discovering NEOs, and
in 2011 the NEO subset of the Wide-Field Infrared Sur-
vey Explorer (NEOWISE, Mainzer et al. 2011) reported
the completion of the initiative to identify 90% of NEOs
greater than 1 km in diameter. The search expanded in
2005 when NASA was instructed to ﬁnd 90% of NEOs
with diameters greater than 140 m within 15 years, a
time window which is closing. Despite CSS, NEOWISE,
ATLAS, the Pan-STARRS Survey (Denneau et al. 2013)
and further programs and surveys dedicated to reaching
this goal, surprise impacts continue; the 2013 event in
Chelyabinsk was caused by an undetected NEO with an
estimated diameter of 20 m (Popova et al. 2013). This
goes to show that blind spots still exist in our tracking
methods and additional SSO exploration is, at the very
least, beneﬁcial.
Observational

limitations also make it particularly
diﬃcult to detect many of the smaller subsets within
the NEO population, including Atens (Earth-crossing
orbit), Atiras (orbits within Earth’s), Vatiras(orbits
within Venus’s), and Earth Trojans (co-orbiting with
Earth). Due to their close proximity to the sun, mem-
bers of these groups elude observation and it is estimated
that only 5–7% of Atiras with absolute magnitudes less
than 20 (d ≈ 300 m) have been found (Ye et al. 2020).
The least studied groups are the Vatiras and the Earth
trojans, as only one of each has been discovered as of
2020 (Greenstreet 2020; Connors et al. 2011). Stud-
ies such as Markwardt et al. (2020)1,which searched for
Earth trojans using exposures from DECam,sometimes
require conﬁning the area included in their search in or-
der to optimize the chances of detection. This and other
surveys that constrain their ﬁelds to small sections of the
sky to improve detection prospects, like those performed
by Terai et al. (2013) and Ivezi´c et al. (2001), often do
not allow for orbit determination as the observation arcs
observed were too short to extrapolate.

Further out beyond the orbit of Mars, the Main Belt is
ﬁlled with dozens of dynamic asteroid groups and fam-
ilies that can be constrained by searches through large
catalogs (Lemaitre 2005). Main Belt Asteroids (MBAs)

1 Data from Markwardt et al. (2020) are included in the NSC

observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are shown to
have a bimodality of carbonaceous and rocky siliceous
objects (Ivezi´c et al. 2001), with size distributions es-
timated assuming consistent albedos throughout each
population. MBA size and color can be relatively well-
studied because of their abundance and our closeness,
but contrasting results raise questions. The steepest es-
timated size distribution is a simple power law ∼ 0.9
from the 2015 High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS)
campaign (Pe˜na et al. 2020), similar only to the results
of Parker et al. (2008), who also use SDSS data. How-
ever, the 2014 HiTS campaign reported a slope of ∼ 0.76
in the g band for brighter objects and ∼ 0.28 for faint
objects (Pe˜na et al. 2020), which is closer to more com-
mon results like those found by Gladman et al. (2009).
According to Pe˜na et al. (2020), this is likely due to
an interesting result described by Bhattacharya et al.
(2010), who reported that objects at ecliptic latitudes
b ≥ 5◦ observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope were
30% fainter than SSOs in the ecliptic plane (the 2015
HiTS campaign observed ﬁelds at a higher ecliptic lat-
itude than the 2014 campaign). Additional SSOs must
be observed to model a more accurate size distribution,
and to provide more insight on its relation to ecliptic
latitude.

At the far reaches of our Solar System, Trans-
Neptunian Objects (TNOs) are distant enough (semi-
major axis a (cid:38) 30 AU ) that they do not feel the eﬀects
of the main planets as much as objects in the inner Solar
System. This means that they are particularly suscep-
tible to external forces like galactic tides, passing stars,
or perhaps even a distant unknown planet. These inter-
actions with extrasolar forces provide insight into the
dynamics, formation, and history of the Solar System.
TNOs, which include Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) and
Oort Cloud Objects (OCOs), are essentially remnants of
the primordial Solar System, and studying their proper-
ties will provide stronger constraints on planet formation
theories.

The potential presence of an unseen planet or mass
has been explored by several authors after the discovery
of Neptune and its perturbed orbit. Pluto’s discovery
in 1930 conﬁrmed the existence of TNOs and alluded to
the possibility of another larger object, dubbed “Planet
X” by astronomer Percival Lowell. The most recent and
promising hypothesis was established when Brown et al.
(2004) discovered 90377Sedna (Sedna), the most distant
SSO known at the time. Sedna has an unusually eccen-
tric and inclined orbit, and one of the proposed causes of
this is the gravitational scattering by an unseen planet.
This hypothesis was further developed when Trujillo &
Sheppard (2014) discovered the second Sedna-like body,

NSC Solar System I

2012 VP133, orbiting at the very edge of the Kuiper belt
using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam, Flaugher et al.
2015). They found that both Sedna and 2012 VP133
showed clustering in the argument of perihelion (ω), the
angle between an inclined SSO’s perihelion and the point
where its orbital plane intersects with the ecliptic plane.
The mechanism by which this clustering is thought to
be achieved is referred to as “gravitational shepherding”,
which describes the eﬀect of a large body on the orbits
of nearby smaller bodies. As a small body passes by a
larger one, the latter’s nonzero net gravitational force on
the former alters its trajectory and shifts its orbit. To
this day, the gravitational shepherding due to a distant
massive planet, often referred to as “Planet 9”, remains
by far the best explanation for the clustering seen in
extra-TNOs.

Batygin & Brown (2016) added to this hypothesis by
showing a clustering in not only ω of Kuiper Belt orbits,
but a physical clustering of their perihelia as well. They
also report that the orbits of known KBOs with semi-
major axis a ≥ 227 AU all approach perihelion within
94◦ of longitude of each other, and all lie in an orbital
plane ∼ 22◦ from the ecliptic (Brown & Batygin 2016).
These numbers are supported by the recent discovery of
541132 Lele¯ak¯uhonua (2015 TG387) by Sheppard et al.
(2019). Two distinct groups of TNOs with similar ω
have allowed astronomers to derive theoretical orbits of
Planet 9.

Alternative explanations have been proposed and re-
jected; Khain et al. (2018) showed that the clustering
may be due in part to the primordial state of the So-
lar System, but would not have produced an eﬀect as
substantial as the one observed. Brown (2017) eﬀec-
tively ruled out observational bias as the cause, esti-
mating that the probability that the 10 KBOs known at
the time with a ≥ 230 AU were part of a larger popu-
lation with uniform ω was 1.2%. A later work (Brown
& Batygin 2019) reported a 0.02% probability that dis-
tant KBOs would be clustered as strongly as observed
in both ω and in orbital pole position if the sole reason
for this clustering was a detection bias.

Constraints on a mass and orbit for Planet 9 have
changed over the years, from Hogg et al. (1991) placing a
detectable limit on its mass of about 70 M⊕, to Batygin
et al. (2019) more recently constricting it to ∼5-10 M⊕
thanks to the greater number of known TNOs. Through
a numerical simulation, Brown & Batygin (2016) sug-
gested that the perihelion of Planet 9 would be between
150 and 350 AU, with an inclination within 30◦ of the
ecliptic.

Studies of the Kuiper Belt and searches for TNOs have
yielded small bodies and dwarf planets, but no body

large enough to cause the observed clustering of TNOs
has been found. Although the existence of Planet 9 itself
remains unconﬁrmed, the discovery of additional TNOs
through the work described in this paper could provide
further evidence. Estimations of its parameters require
a working knowledge of the most distant SSOs, hence
the need to continue the search for them. Similarities
between new and known objects may support the ev-
idence of Planet 9 and contribute to estimations of its
properties, while diﬀerences may lead to new hypotheses
for unidentiﬁed forces acting on TNOs.

Two common obstacles that surveys face include lim-
itations on the brightness of what can be detected (typ-
ical depth ≈ 19–24 mag, Denneau et al. 2013) and the
area of the sky covered by observations. SSO-based
surveys are often constrained to the ecliptic where the
bulk of the solar system’s mass is found, meaning more
surveys and catalogs with more sky coverage must be
searched to detect objects with high orbital inclinations
to explore relationships such as the latitude–magnitude
dependence shown by Pe˜na et al. (2020) and Bhat-
tacharya et al. (2010). Several wide-ﬁeld surveys have
been used to achieve this, such as CSS, the Near-Earth
Asteroid Tracking program (NEAT; Pravdo et al. 1999),
CCS, and the the Lincoln near-Earth asteroid program
(LINEAR; Stokes et al. 2000), although both NEAT
and LINEAR focus mainly on the northern celestial
hemisphere due to the location of the telescopes used.
The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST;
Ivezi´c et al. 2019) with the Rubin Observatory will ex-
tensively monitor the southern sky and is predicted to
increase the known number of all small body popula-
tions by 10–100× (Jones et al. 2016), and is expected
to be a signiﬁcant detector of NEOs Veres & Chesley
(2017). However, much of the northern sky will remain
unmonitored at the faint magnitudes.

Independent endeavors to create detection algorithms
that can be applied to any astronomical data, for ex-
ample the NEARBY Platform (Stefanut et al. 2019),
the Moving Object Processing System (MOPS) devel-
oped for Pan-STARRS, and other methods (e.g. Lieu
et al. 2019, Perdelwitz et al. 2018, and Holman et al.
2018) have varying degrees of success and can typically
be tuned to ﬁnd speciﬁc families of SSOs with similar
orbits. A recent example of this is THOR (Tracklet-less
Heliocentric Orbit Recovery), an algorithm developed
with detections from the Zwicky Transient Facility to
extract SSO detections by applying test orbits to the
data (Moeyens & Juric 2019).

This work describes the background and implementa-
tion of the Computationally Automated NSC-tracklet
Finder (CANFind), an approach designed to iden-

epoch measurements like the NOIRLab Source Catalog
(NSC)2. The NSC is a crowd-sourced catalog covering
3/4 of the sky, with 34 billion observations, most regions
are covered by at least 3 exposures. We test CANFind
on the ﬁrst data release of the NSC, and detect over
500,000 tracklets to magnitudes of 24 mag. 50,222 of
these 500,000 tracklets have g-r, r-i color-color infor-
mation showing a distinct bimodality of two general
asteroid types (carbonaceous and silicious). 85.9% of
tracklets were found within ±30◦ of the ecliptic plane,
and 60% have more than three measurements.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
the ﬁrst data release of the NOIRLab Source Catalog
and its beneﬁts for the use of SSO detection. CANFind
is explained in Section 3, an overview of the detection
eﬃciency simulation is in Section 4, the results are dis-
cussed in Section 5, and future work to be done with
NSC tracklets is described in Section 6. This introduces
a set of planned publications all involving SSO detection
in the NSC and subsequent investigation. Upcoming
projects will connect tracklets with more spatially dis-
perse measurements, ﬁt NSC tracklets to SSO orbits,
and analyze recovered SSO populations, morphology,
comet activity, and streaked detections.

2. NOIRLAB SOURCE CATALOG

This project uses the ﬁrst data release of the NOIR-
Lab Source Catalog (NSC; Nidever et al. 2018) to detect
SSOs. The NSC is a crowd-sourced catalog using public
data from the NOIRLab Science Archive processed in
a uniform manner. The NSC has 34 billion individual
observations of 2.9 billion distinct objects from 255,000

images spanning ﬁve years of observation from 2012–
2017. Data come from DECam on CTIO-4m, KPNO-
4m+Mosaic-3, and Bok-2.3m+90Prime from the DESI
Legacy Survey (Dey et al. 2019). Table 1 lists sev-
eral speciﬁcations from the instruments used by the
surveys included in the catalog. The NSC contains a
large amount of time series information that is useful
for searches of moving objects and photometrically vari-
able objects. Table 2 lists information from the 11 top-
contributing surveys in DR1.

The NSC data are publicly available through the Astro
Data Lab3, and can by accessed via SQL queries. The
catalog will be updated periodically, with the second
data release containing over 68 billion measurements of
3.9 billion objects (Nidever et al. 2020). Figure 1 shows

the object density (left) and exposure coverage (right)
of NSC DR1. An overview of NSC DR1 can be found
on the Astro Data Lab site4, and a complete description
is available in Nidever et al. (2018).

From the NSC DR1 exposures table, the average ex-
posure time is 96.28 s, with a minimum of 0.01 s and a
maximum of 1300 s. Figure 2 shows the number den-
sity for the full range of exposure times, broken down
by instrument. As described in Section 3.2, the NSC
is only searched for SSOs in areas covered by at least
3 exposures; the diﬀerence between the total exposure
list and the searched exposure list is also shown in Fig.
2. All exposures are run through the NOIRLab Com-
munity Pipeline. Flaugher et al. (2015) report a shutter
accuracy of ≤1ms for DECam, which provides both the
largest sample of exposures and the widest range of ex-
posure times. Images with long exposure times may con-
tain detections of faint TNOs detected as point sources
as well as streaking from SSOs exhibiting higher proper
motion; for an exposure time of 1300 seconds, an object
moving µ=20(cid:48)(cid:48)relative to the background would leave a
(cid:118)7.2(cid:48)(cid:48)trail, within the (cid:118)1080(cid:48)(cid:48)range of a typical single
DECam CCD (2048x4096 pixels with pixel scale 0.26).
The NSC measurements table (nsc dr1.meas) pro-
vides the main souce of data for this work. Each source-
extracted measurement is represented as a row of data
in the table, with a total of 34,658,213,888 rows. 31
columns of detection parameters include position and
positional uncertainty (RA, Dec), exposure ﬁlter, ap-
parent magnitude (mag auto), photometry information,
and the observation Modiﬁed Julian Date (MJD). An
overview of all columns of the measurements table table
is also available at Astro Data Lab5.

Use of the NSC may provide solutions to some of the
limitations common to SSO searches described in the
previous section. One issue is the potential for observa-

5 https://datalab.noirlab.edu/query.php?name=nsc dr1.meas

tional bias in the regions covered. The focus of surveys
is often away from the galactic plane, due to the higher
density of objects in that areapolluting the recovered
SSO population. NSC DR1 covers 3/4 of the sky and
approximately half of the galactic plane is included in
the observed region, meaning this project searches por-
tions of the sky that are under-examined for SSOs.

A drawback of the NSC is that exposures of the most
dense areas are often oversaturated, resulting in a lack of
distinction between real sources and image artifacts, and
therefore a higher rate of false positives in SSO searches
near the galactic plane (δ ≤ 15◦) and the Magellanic
Clouds (5◦ around LMC and 3◦ around SMC). The
NOIRLab Community Pipeline used in the NSC cali-
bration process masks saturated stars and their bleed
trails, however some eﬀects from bright saturated star
still get through including scattered light in the periph-
ery. These generally do not line up in any preferred
direction, and their eﬀect must be accounted for in the
validation of any tracklets found in the NSC.

The limiting magnitude of a survey is also very im-
portant: distant SSOs are quite faint and will be un-
detectable to most telescopes during the bulk of their
orbits due to low albedo or large distance. The depth
of most NSC exposures is approximately 23rd mag, an
adequate value for detecting TNOs whose magnitudes
are typically fainter than 20th mag. The NSC also con-
tains multi-band information that provide colors of ob-
jects and will shed further light on their properties. In a
study of the colors of almost 100 TNOs, Schwamb et al.
(2019) found two taxonomic groups, and the NSC should
contain measurements of enough TNOs for a similar in-
vestigation (see Sec. 5).

Any newly discovered objects may also clarify the size
distribution of solar system bodies. For instance, Shep-
pard & Trujillo (2010) showed a lack of discovered in-
termediate and small Neptune Trojans. Missing objects
may be uncovered in the NSC after orbit determination,
or may otherwise support these missing Trojans. By in-
vestigating the range of asteroid sizes, new parameters

can be established regarding the accretion and forma-
tion history of the solar system.

Finally, the NSC covers much of the southern celes-
tial hemisphere, which has been largely under-searched
in SSO surveys. Five years of observations indicates the
likelihood of orbiting bodies appearing in the NSC mul-
tiple times. An issue is the intermittent observational
pattern; certain areas of the NSC have insuﬃcient ex-
posure coverage for SSO detection, as the contributing
surveys were designed for various purposes. At least

three exposures of a ﬁeld are required to detect track-
lets as deﬁned in this work. Section 3.2 describes the
selection of areas with adequate NSC coverage.

Because of these reasons, the deep, multi-band, time-
series NSC information will allow this work to markedly
improve the census of solar system bodies and help our
understanding of planet formation. Detections of Planet
9 may be hiding in the NSC, and, at the very least, any
KBOs found in the catalog will provide further investi-
gation into its proposed existence.

3. MOVING OBJECT DETECTION METHOD

3.1. Spatial Clustering with DBSCAN on Hyalite

Here we describe the CANFind method used to detect
SSO moving objects in the NSC catalog. The source
code is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn6
(Pedregosa et al. 2011) machine learning package.
CANFind relies on two scikit-learn algorithms: the
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with
Noise (DBSCAN; Ester et al. 1996) and RANdom SAm-
ple Consensus (RANSAC; Fischler & Bolles 1981), a
linear regressor that is robust to outliers. Beginning
with the NSC meas table of individual exposure mea-
surements, the main steps are:

1. Initial spatial clustering with DBSCAN (eps =
0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)) to detect and remove stationary objects and
initial detection of moving objects with moderate
angular velocities.

2. Second spatial clustering with DBSCAN (eps =
11(cid:48)(cid:48)) to identify detections of SSOs which form
tracklets.

3. Validation of tracklets obtained in steps 1 & 2
using robust linear regression (RANSAC) and the
Pearson Correlation Coeﬃcient (PCC). Proper
motions of valid tracklets are measured.

4. Track formation and validation by linking track-
lets and unclustered measurements by using
proper motion to predict object position at com-
mon epochs.

A ﬂowchart outlining the process described in this sec-

tion can be seen in Fig. 3.

DBSCAN is used in an iterative process to assign mea-
surements to unique objects, both stationary and mov-
ing. DBSCAN clusters data in areas of high density,
and was developed in order to categorize the objects of
a database into relevant groups.

This particular algorithm was selected for a number of
reasons, the most important being that minimal knowl-
edge of the data set is required to establish the two DB-
SCAN input parameters set for this project; the eps-
neighborhood (eps) of a point, which is the maximum
distance between two points for one to be considered as
in the neighborhood of the other, and npoints, the min-
imum number of points required to deﬁne a cluster. In
the case of this work, DBSCAN is applied to measure-
ments using only the information of spatial location, and
eps and npoints are determined based on the type of ob-
ject being clustered. DBSCAN also does not require a
set number of priors, which is advantageous as there is
no way of knowing how many objects, stationary or oth-
erwise, will be in any area of the sky. One caveat is that
DBSCAN does not take into account the positional un-
certainties of measurements; they are, however, included
in the calculation of tracklet proper motion.

The second reason for the selection of DBSCAN is its
ability to identify clusters with arbitrary shape. This
allows one clustering method to be applied to all types
of objects in the NSC identiﬁed in this work.
It can
cluster the measurements of both stationary objects
(SOs), which lie in close proximity to each other in a
roughly spherical pattern, as well as the more linearly-
distributed measurements of moving objects. As DB-
SCAN is only used to connect intra-night detections,
more complex SSO motion can be ignored for the ex-
tent of its use. Furthermore, the capability of DBSCAN
to identify outlier points is essential to the method of ap-

8

Fasbender et al.

plication, as described in the following sections. Some
of scikit-learn’s other clustering algorithms oﬀer this
feature; for example the Variational Bayesian Gaussian
Mixture Model (VBGMM) was also considered as it can
identify clusters with both strong and weak linear corre-
lations. Ultimately, the number of necessary parameters
and the slow computation speeds (this algorithm is not
good for very large datasets) eliminated VBGMM in fa-
vor of DBSCAN.

Lastly, DBSCAN is very eﬃcient for large databases
with signiﬁcantly more than several thousand objects
(Ester et al. 1996). As we analyze billions of measure-
ments, it is essential that CANFind is as eﬃcient as pos-
sible to maintain reasonable computation times. This is
aided by Montana State University’s Hyalite computer
cluster, enabling the application of these methods on
the vast extent of the NSC through a parallelized frame-
work. Hyalite has 1,300 cores and 77 computing nodes
with either 64 or 256 GB of RAM. By running CAN-
Find on the Hyalite cluster, many areas of the sky can
be searched simultaneously and the computation time is
dramatically reduced.

We take advantage of the NSC coming pre-divided
into HEALPix7 (sections of equal area, G´orski et al.
2005) with NSIDE=265 indexed in the ring265 column
of the object table, and query 4 neighboring HEALPix
at a time to combine them into an area that takes CAN-
Find an average of 5 seconds to analyze, depending
on the number of sources and measurements present
in the ﬁeld. The resulting combined HEALPix, with
NSIDE=128 for a resolution of approximately 0.5◦,
is run through the CANFind process with several of
its neighboring HEALPix as a job on Hyalite’s slurm
queue. Although Hyalite allows several HEALPix to
be processed simultaneously, computation speed is ham-
pered slightly by PostgreSQL query limitations. Fewer
HEALPix can be analyzed per job in ﬁelds with high
object density, as this increases the query processing
time and slows down the job’s progression. Additionally,
jobs had to be submitted in incremental batches as the
database can only handle a limited amount of queries at
a time. Depending on the ﬁeld density, 1–10 jobs were
submitted every 10–60 minutes for 1–5 HEALPix per
job. Using roughly 10 nodes at a time with 32 or 40
CPU/node, the NSC took approximately one week to
analyze on Hyalite.

The rest of this section describes how DBSCAN is
used to assign NSC measurements to unique objects, vi-
sualized Figure 4. The ﬁrst iteration of DBSCAN iden-

tiﬁes and removes stationary objects moving less than
2.5(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(0.017◦day−1) for a separate vetting process,
leaving remaining measurements to be clustered into dis-
tinct moving objects during the second iteration. These
data will be ﬁt to solar system orbits to create object
candidates, and the properties of these candidates will
be derived and analyzed.

3.2. Selecting areas of the sky for initial tracklet search

The NSC has a very high object density within the
Galactic plane of the Milky Way. Exposures from the
galactic plane also contain a high number of very bright
and saturated stars which can cause various artifacts in
the source catalog. Because these artifacts heavily im-
pair the performance of the DBSCAN detection method,
fewer objects are expected to be extracted within ±15◦
of the galactic plane. This is exacerbated by the high
density of background objects in both the galactic plane
and the Magellanic Clouds, as crowding hampers the
ability of DBSCAN to diﬀerentiate unique sources. A
sample of tracklets extracted from these areas by CAN-
Find is examined in ﬁner detail in Section 5.

We used the HEALPix scheme with nside=128 to
break up the sky into smaller chunks to be analyzed
separately. For the initial search, only areas of sky with
adequate cadence to capture sequential displacements of
the faster-moving SSOs were used. The selection criteria
was that the HEALPix must have coverage from at least
three or more exposures taken within roughly 20 min-
utes of each other. This reduced the 153,472 HEALPix
covered by the NSC to 132,884 to be studied with CAN-
Find.

3.3. Vetting NSC Objects

Because some SSOs have proper motions low enough
to be represented in the NSC object table, we run
an additional test on all NSC objects with at least 3
detections and a recorded NSC proper motion above
0.0041(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(2.7e-5◦day−1). This value corresponds to
the average proper motion of 2015 TG387, a TNO with
the second-largest semimajor axis known to date (1085
AU) and an orbit stable over the history of the solar
system (Sheppard et al. 2019).

Every object above the minimum proper motion is an-
alyzed to estimate the likelihood that it is an SSO. With
a set residual threshold of 0.001◦, RANSAC is applied to
the spacial and temporal object data to remove galaxies
with several NSC detections over multiple years. The
curve fit function from scipy.optimize is applied to
the measurements of each object to calculate proper mo-
tion in RA and Dec [(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1].

A signal to noise cut of S/N≥4 was made on net proper
motion in order to reduce the contamination of stars

NSC Solar System I

Figure 4. An example spatial map of NSC measurements showing clear detections of three Solar System Objects (SSO). The
SSOs move rapidly (∼40(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1or 0.27◦day−1) and show a “tracklet” while background objects keep a ﬁxed position (panel a).
Measurements belonging to ﬁxed objects are clustered (panel b) and removed, leaving behind outlier measurements (panel c) to
be assigned to moving objects. A second iteration of clustering identiﬁes the SSO tracklets (panel d).

this reason, only the NSC measurement table was used
for this step. Panels a and b of Figure 4 demonstrate the
application of DBSCAN on 2,928 measurements from
the NSC in HEALPix pixel 124958 positioned a few de-
grees from the ecliptic plane, forming 48 clusters (SOs)
and leaving 38 outliers. The proper motions of many
of these objects are already given by the NSC catalog
and were referenced in the analysis for objects exhibiting
Solar System-like motions. The DBSCAN outliers are
retained to be assigned to faster-moving objects in the
next step. Because the source-extracted measurements
of resolved galaxies may be more than 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)apart, nearby
galaxies are often not identiﬁed in this ﬁrst step, and
must be removed later during the validation process.

3.5. Identifying Tracklets and Tracks

The identiﬁcation of tracklets and tracks is performed

in three steps:

Linking Measurements into Tracklets: Once
measurements of SOs are identiﬁed and removed, the
remaining measurements are assigned to unique mov-
ing objects by the second iteration of DBSCAN. When
closely-spaced exposures (∼20 minutes apart in this ex-
ample) are analyzed, measurements of fast moving ob-
jects form spatially linear structures called “tracklets”.
Because these measurements are farther apart from each
other than those belonging to SOs, a new eps of 11(cid:48)(cid:48)is
used, as seen in panel d of Figure 4. Each DBSCAN clus-
ter must now contain npoints ≥ 3 detections, according
to our deﬁnition of a tracklet as a collection of at least
three displaced detections of a unique object. There-
fore, each cluster is a tracklet that may represent the
detections of an SSO, and are referred to as “CANFind
tracklets”.

Tracklet Validation: Each clustered tracklet under-
goes a validation process to ensure that its measure-

surements between them, are linked together to form a track

3.5.

and galaxies among true detections of SSOs. To fur-
ther reduce this contamination, a cut on the reduced
chi squared value was made, keeping all objects with
χ2
ν ≤ 1.5. Despite quality cuts, it is expected that a
greater number of false tracklets are present in the 2095
objects that passed this validation step. Nonetheless,
they are considered to be tracks or tracklets, and there-
fore will be tested as SSO candidates with the rest of
the tracklets detected by CANFind.

3.4. Stationary Object Identiﬁcation

DBSCAN is ﬁrst used to identify measurements be-
longing to slow-moving or stationary objects using a rel-
atively small eps = 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)and npoints = 2. The eps value
was selected to reﬂect the original object identiﬁcation of
the NSC. The NSC object table was created by associ-
ating points within 0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)of each other, but this did not ac-
count for the faster proper motion (µ) of most SSOs. For

ments are consistently linear in space and time, and
to eliminate any falsely clustered data. Some nearby,
spatially-resolved galaxies with a roughly linear dis-
tribution of measurements are mistakenly clustered as
trackletsin this step, as DBSCAN often fails to iden-
tify them as stationary objects if that distribution is
too large. However, they are easily identiﬁed through
examination of their temporal information. In the cre-
ation of the NSC, multiple source detections from a sin-
gle galaxy were sometimes extracted from one exposure,
so resulting DBSCAN clusters do not produce a realistic
trajectory for an SSO.

To test each tracklet, its measurements are analyzed
using RANSAC on both the spatial coordinates and the
tracklet’s normalized (position,time) information. Any
outlier found by RANSAC is likely an incorrectly clus-
tered measurement, and is eliminated from the tracklet.
As an additional step, the Pearson Correlation Coef-
ﬁcient (PCC) is calculated for each tracklet. The as-
sumption that a true tracklet has measurements that
fall into a straight line motivates the PCC cutoﬀ value
of ≥ |0.9| used by CANFind. . If the spread of tracklet
measurements is too large, then the cluster likely only
contains measurements of a galaxy, not an SSO. This
validation process disposes of many erroneous tracklets,
making the next step of linking tracklets together a less
computationally expensive process.

Linking Measurements and Tracklets

into
Tracks: Track formation in CANFind is meant to asso-
ciate tracklets with both other tracklets and unclustered
measurements left from the previous clustering steps.
After a tracklet is veriﬁed, the slope values determined
by RANSAC are saved as the proper motion in RA and
Dec [◦day−1]. Using these values, a position-prediction
method is applied to the tracklets and remaining un-
clustered measurements within the HEALPix, allowing
them to be connected into longer “tracks”, which consist
of at least two tracklets and typically contain detections
from multiple nights. As the assumption of linear mo-
tion starts to fail for trajectories spanning so much time,
the track validation step is less restrictive than tracklet
validation; that is to say, the positional uncertainty al-
lowed for predicted positions of tracklet measurements
is large (0.005◦) compared to measurement uncertainty
to account for the deviation from linearity that SSOs
display over multiple nights.

The proper motion of a tracklet is used to project its
position to the observation time of other tracklets and
unclustered measurements. This is done twice - ﬁrst, the
calculated proper motion of a single tracklet is applied to
all other tracklets and unclustered measurements in the
healpix, and all points are moved to the location they
would hypothetically be at a common time. If the posi-
tions coincide within a few times their measurement un-

certainties, then the tracklets and unassigned measure-
ments are linked together into tracks. This is repeated
for every tracklet in the healpix. A second “projection”
process is applied for comparison, this time with each
tracklet moving at its own calculated velocity to a com-
mon epoch. An example of track formation is shown in
Figure 5.

To demonstrate the typical distribution of tracklets
within the ecliptic plane, Figure 6 roughly covers the
area of one DECam ﬁeld, with color as detection time.

4. EFFICIENCY SIMULATIONS

To test the eﬃciency and completeness of CAN-
Findand the NSC Object Vetting process to detect
moving objects, a simulation was created that gener-
ated synthetic tracklets with linear trajectories and a
range of proper motions that are characteristic of SSOs.
These tracklets had between 3 and 10 measurements,
and the average tracklet cadence was between 20 min-
utes (CANFind) up to several hours (NSC Object Vet-
ting). Measurements were given equatorial coordinates,
an observation date, and a magnitude between 14–25
with an uncertainty (magerr auto) that was then used
to calculate the positional error in (RA,Dec). These gen-
erated tracklets were separately added to un-analyzed
NSC measurements from a HEALPix (nside=128) in a
ﬁeld of average object density.

The ﬁrst set of tests varied the range of input tracklet
proper motion with the goal of determining biases set
by CANFind’s use of DBSCAN. Simulations of 100,000
tracklets each were run for diﬀerent ranges of µ to ex-
plore the upper and lower limits of CANFind’s range.
Results for 0 ≤ µ ≤100(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(0.67◦day−1), 0 ≤ µ ≤

15(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(0.1◦day−1), and 0 ≤ µ ≤ 8(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1 (0.053◦day−1)
are shown in Figure 7.

The performance of CANFind for a range of magni-
tude uncertainties was explored in a second set of tests
using an average FWHM value = 1.18 from the NSC
exposure table. The range of magerr auto was sampled
from several areas including the galactic plane, ecliptic
plane, and in a ﬁeld away from both planes. Between
simulations of 100,000 tracklets each for three ranges of
magnitude uncertainties (0.0002–0.002 mag, 0.002–0.02
mag, and 0.02–0.2 mag) CANFind’s detection eﬃciency
only changed slightly (97.6%, 97.2%, and 95.5% for the
three ranges, respectively).

In addition to the 600,000 tracklets tested over varying
µ and magerr auto, a cumulative 200,000 tracklet test
over full proper motion and uncertainty ranges found
that CANFind recovered 96.5% of synthetic tracklets
with average measurement spacing (∆s) between 0.5–
10.9(cid:48)(cid:48)for proper motions less than 1.4◦day−1(209(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1)
to within 1(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1of their input proper motion. The
limits of CANFind are a result of the parameters
used in both instances of DBSCAN. The ﬁrst itera-
tion (eps=0.5(cid:48)(cid:48)) to dispose of stationary objects sets
the lower limit, (center panel of Fig 7), and the up-
per limit (left panel of Fig. 7) is set by the second
iteration (eps=11(cid:48)(cid:48)). As a result, this search optimizes
CANFind to detect tracklets with cadences between
0.5–11(cid:48)(cid:48)(0.00012–0.003◦).

CANFind’s false positive rate was also tested in ﬁelds
of varying object density. Fake, linear sky-plane track-
lets were created with measurements spanning one night
or less, and given random, realistic positional uncertain-

12

Fasbender et al.

ties and observation times. One set of 1000,000 synthetic
“fake” tracklets was analyzed in a HEALPix 5◦ above
the galactic plane (35,993 objects, 159,191 exposures)
and in a HEALPix 6◦ above the ecliptic (7,990 objects,
248,004 measurements). The fake tracklets,
like the
“true” tracklets created for previous simulations, con-
sisted of 3 to 10 measurements spaced less than 0.003◦
(10.8(cid:48)(cid:48)) from each other. In both ﬁelds, 3% of fake track-
lets were falsely recovered by CANFind.

Finally, the eﬃciency of the track linking process
was tested at a range of velocities between 0 ≤
µ ≤60(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(0.4◦day−1). 100,000 tracks were created for
this test by extending a synthetic tracklet beyond the
timeframe of one night, either creating a new tracklet or
adding unlinked ”detections” of the object ”observed”
at a later time. Track measurements were given the
same information given in tracklet simulations, and all
complete tracklets created to form tracks were correctly
recovered by CANFind. 80% of the synthetic tracks
were completely identiﬁed by CANFind.

5. RESULTS

lets in ecliptic proper motion can be seen in Fig-
ure 8. The 2,094 tracklets detected by the NSC ob-
ject vetting process ﬁll the range between 0≤ µ ≤
2.5(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(0.017◦day−1) left by CANFind (Figure 9).
The distribution of tracklets in ecliptic coordinates is
shown in Figure 10. 177,949 tracklets (40%) contain
only three detections. 170,584 tracklets were detected
within 5% of the ecliptic, and 380,189 have negative
ecliptic longitudinal proper motions. Tracklets detected
at high ecliptic latitudes tend to be high in proper mo-
tion ((cid:118)100(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1, or 0.67◦day−1, and above). Figure
11 shows these objects following a color proﬁle similar
to stars and galaxies, suggesting a higher rate of false
tracklets in regions further from the ecliptic.

Samples of tracklets from high-density areas (galactic
latitude ≤ 15◦, 5◦ around LMC, 3◦ around SMC) were
examined in more detail. Despite greater NSC exposure
coverage in the galactic plane, CANFind detected more
tracklets near the Magellanic Clouds. A visual inspec-
tion of tracklets pulled from this area revealed a higher
number of false positives detected near the MCs.
It
is likely that fewer tracklets were found in the galactic
plane due to the crowding of sources and the optimal
spacing between exposures in the MCs.

Several clear structures in proper motion space can be
seen in Fig. 8, reﬂecting diﬀerent groups of SSOs. Most
tracklets have proper motions that indicate main-belt

resented as well. Most prominent, centered at roughly
µl=−40(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(-0.27◦day−1), µb=0(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1in µ-space is a
group of tracklets consistent with MBA proper motion.
The presence of Jupiter Trojans and Trans-Neptunian
objects are evident at µl=−20(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(-0.13◦day−1) and
µb=3(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1(0.02◦day−1). A noticeable feature of proper
motion distribution are the “wings”, which extend from
the MBA group. Terai et al. (2013) describe these struc-
tures as a result of the variety of inclination and semi-
major axes values of MBAs. A more detailed analysis
of each group will require orbital ﬁtting (see Sec. 6).

Tracklets were detected in all photometric bands in-
cluded in the NSC (ugrizY and VR). If a single tracklet
contained multiple detections in the same band, their
mean value was recorded as the tracklet’s magnitude in
that band. Figure 12 shows the normalized distribution
of magnitudes for the ugr bands extending to ∼ 24 mag.
Table 3 gives the number of tracklets with data in each
band. This overall distribution of tracklet detections in
the various bands largely reﬂects the underlying distri-

bution of exposures in the NSC, but may also be aﬀected
by the asteroid compositions.

lets show a bimodality in color identiﬁed in Ivezi´c et al.
(2001), most notably in g-r vs r-i (see Figure 13). Ob-
jects which fall in the redder group are mainly S-type
rocky (siliceous) asteroids, while those in the bluer group
are C-type (carbonaceous) asteroids. 45.5% of tracklets
fall roughly into the C-type group, with the remaining
fraction closer to S-type.

A fraction of the tracklet measurements were found
in images with exposure times long enough to produce a
trailing eﬀect, as no morphology cuts are made on track-
let measurements to remove elongated detections. NSC
measurements are found with Source Extractor (Bertin
& Arnouts 1996), which can identify objects of various
shapes including stars, elongated galaxies, and streaked
SSOs. As a result, some trailed measurements of SSOs
are identiﬁed and present in the NSC measurements ta-
ble. Figure 14 gives an example of trails left by a tracklet
detected by CANFind. For reference, 119 of the 255,454

NSC DR1 images have exposure times ≥ 1000 seconds,
and 881 have exposure times ≥ 600 sec. We ﬁnd an
approximate upper limit on the proper motion of CAN-
Find tracklets containing measurements from these im-
ages, proportional to exposure time. This corresponds
a the limit on trailed detections represented as single
source detections in the NSC. Trails longer than (cid:118)13”
are not identiﬁed by CANFind as the source extraction
process will incorrectly identify multiple sources from a
single streak, all with the same observation date. Future
analysis will properly identify longer trails.

6. FUTURE WORK

Recovered tracklet measurements, along with mea-
surements not associated with stationary objects, are
stored in a PostgreSQL database at MSU for ease of ac-
cess, similar to the one used to house the NSC in the
Astro Data Lab. In the future, we plan to run CAN-
Find on the second data release of the NSC and the
same techniques described in this paper will be applied
to the new data.

According to Weryk et al. (2020), the Isolated Tracklet
File (ITF) of the Minor Planet Center, the organization
responsible for the designation of all minor SSOs, holds
over 16.6 billion unlinked measurements. Once further
developed, CANFind may be applied to the ITF in hopes
of reducing its volume.

The following steps will be taken next:

tudes of NSC tracklets extracted by CANFind.

• Linking Dispersed Measurements of Moving Ob-
jects with the Hough Transform: While DBSCAN
eﬀectively extracts tracklets with closely-spaced
measurements, it does not identify those with a
more disperse layout. These detections will be
connected via the Hough Transform approach, a
feature extraction technique traditionally used to
isolate features in an image (Duda & Hart 1972),
often straight lines or simple shapes. The process
is related to the Radon Transform (Radon 1917)
and works roughly as follows: Every NSC mea-
surement will cast votes for all trajectory param-
eters (ρ, θ) consistent with that measurement and
the votes from other measurements accumulated
in a 2-D parameter/accumulator array. Multiple
measurements voting for the same line will suggest
a candidate trajectory, identiﬁed by peaks in the
accumulator array.

The development of a modiﬁed version of the
Hough Transform designed to work on data points
rather than images is the subject of ongoing work.

• Analysis of Trailed Detections: We plan to identify
and analyze streaked detections in NSC exposures
to determine further SSO candidates in NSD DR1.
While several tracklets detected by CANFind con-
tain trailed measurements, individual streaks re-
main unidentiﬁed. These will be identiﬁed using
new or existing software on exposures and ana-
lyzed using PSF ﬁtting.

• Orbit Determination: Due to retrograde motion,
linking tracks, tracklets, and unclustered measure-
ments to form potential solar system orbits re-
quires the use of an orbit ﬁtting program designed
to account for the eﬀects of the Earth’s motion on

the apparent trajectories of other moving objects.
Groups of measurements connected by a possible
solar system orbit will be designated as a solar
system object candidate, and will be studied and
reported to the Minor Planet Center.

Properties of derived orbits will be analyzed
against known objects. Many science questions
can be addressed, especially considering the great
quantity of observations available in the NSC.
Once all tracks and tracklets in NSC DR1 have
been identiﬁed using CANFind and the Hough
Transform approach, they will be ﬁt to possible
SSO orbits. We hold oﬀ on this step until as many
tracklets as possible can be identiﬁed in the NSC
for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of cor-
rectly matching tracklets corresponding to unique
objects.

• Comparison of Eﬃciency with THOR: The eﬀec-
tiveness of these detection methods will be tested
against the results of Tracklet-less Heliocentric
Object Recovery (THOR; Moeyens & Juric 2019),
which recovers known solar system objects by ap-
plying test orbits to object detections. THOR ap-
plies several orbits that are characteristic of dis-
tinct types of solar system objects to detections
in a region of the sky, and objects placed in very
similar orbits are evaluated and connected. When

CP-processed DECam exposures from NSC DR1 show 7(cid:48)(cid:48)trails with their Source-Extracted measurements over-plotted in red
crosses. The trail length for the exposure time matches the proper motion predicted by CANFind from the tracklet’s trajectory,
µ = 42(cid:48)(cid:48)hr−1. Note: For those interested, the “stationary” object behind the tracklet is white dwarf SDSS J093839.94+170357.7

tested on data from the Zwicky Transient Facil-
ity, THOR recovered 97.4% of known asteroids
(Moeyens & Juric 2019). However, THOR has
not yet been tested or optimized for NEOs and
cannot generate initial orbits. We will run THOR
on the NSC and compare the resulting set of solar
system objects to those detected by the methods
described above.

The CANFind source code and a complete catalog of
the tracklets detected in the NSC DR1 are publicly avail-
able at https://github.com/katiefasbender/CANFind.
The tracklet catalog includes information about each
tracklet’s mean (RA,Dec) position, date of ﬁrst obser-
vation, average magnitude in each of the NSC’s ﬁlters,
proper motion in both equatorial and ecliptic coordi-
nates [◦day−1], in FITS format.

7. SUMMARY

8. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We describe CANFind, a new Solar System object de-
tection algorithm which we have applied on DR1 of the
NOIRLab Source Catalog. We detected 524,501 track-
lets in 35,644 HEALPix of nside-128, covering 19% of
the sky. The majority of tracklets have photometric
data in the g, r, VR, and i bands, with fewer detec-
tions in u, z, and y. The 50,000 tracklets with mea-
surements in the g, r, and i bands show a bimodality
of siliceous and carbonaceous objects, supporting the
results of prior studies. In proper motion space, track-
lets fall into groups with motion indicating the presence
of Main Belt objects, Jupiter Trojans, Hilda asteroids,
and Trans-Neptunian objects. Roughly one third of all
tracklets were detected within 5◦ of the ecliptic.

In the near future, CANFind will be run on NSC DR2
which contains 68 billion measurements of 3.9 billion
unique objects (Nidever et al. 2020). The data will also
be searched using a modiﬁed Hough Transform approach
in order to link tracklets with detections that are farther
spaced-out. Tracklets found will be ﬁt to potential so-
lar system orbits and submitted to the Minor Planet
Center.
