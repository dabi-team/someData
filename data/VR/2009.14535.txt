Abstract
A major issue in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approaches is the numerical dissipation during the projection pro-
cess, especially under coarse discretizations. High-frequency details, such as turbulence and vortices, are smoothed out, leading
to unrealistic results. To address this issue, we introduce a Vorticity Reﬁnement (VR) solver for SPH ﬂuids with negligible com-
putational overhead. In this method, the numerical dissipation of the vorticity ﬁeld is recovered by the difference between the
theoretical and the actual vorticity, so as to enhance turbulence details. Instead of solving the Biot-Savart integrals, a stream
function, which is easier and more efﬁcient to solve, is used to relate the vorticity ﬁeld to the velocity ﬁeld. We obtain turbu-
lence effects of different intensity levels by changing an adjustable parameter. Since the vorticity ﬁeld is enhanced according
to the curl ﬁeld, our method can not only amplify existing vortices, but also capture additional turbulence. Our VR solver is
straightforward to implement and can be easily integrated into existing SPH methods.

1. Introduction

Fluid simulation is a hot topic in computer graphics, with huge re-
search and application demands. Within this context, the Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method simulates ﬂuids with large
deformations accurately and efﬁciently, showing abundant details
and vivid motion. In the past decades, several solutions have
been proposed to enforce incompressibility [SP09, ICS∗14, BK15].
However, numerical dissipation problems still remain and cause
a signiﬁcant loss of turbulence details [JST17, FGG∗17]. For in-
stance, vorticity dissipation is one of the major issues causing the
loss of details on the ﬂuid surface and in overall dynamic effects
[KBST19].

To maintain complex turbulence and vortex details on the ﬂuid
surface, some methods proposed to increase the apparent resolution
by seeding over surface points [MBT∗15], or use an adaptive volu-
metric mesh for grid-based ﬂuids [EB14]. However, these methods
only add details over a coarse discretization, without considering
the inner volume. Vorticity Conﬁnement (VC) methods add vor-
tices from the perspective of the entire ﬂow ﬁeld [FSJ01, MM13]
to recover dissipated details. However, VC methods tend to add
more energy than is dissipated, and can amplify only existing vor-
tices. Lagrangian vortex methods, such as vortex particles [PK05]
and vortex ﬁlaments [WP10], have been used to effectively simu-
late turbulent ﬂuids. While these methods maintain a divergence-
free velocity ﬁeld and have theoretically no numerical dissipation,
they require solving the equivalent of three Poisson equations to
obtain velocity from vorticity, which is computationally expensive.

To alleviate the above-mentioned problems and obtain more real-
istic turbulent ﬂows, we introduce a turbulence reﬁnement scheme
by correcting the vorticity ﬁeld. In continuum mechanics, vortic-
ity is a pseudovector ﬁeld that describes the local spinning motion
of a continuum. It can be deﬁned as the curl of the ﬂuidâ ˘A ´Zs ve-
locity ﬁeld. Like the divergence error issue mentioned in the DF-
SPH method [BK15], vorticity dissipation also reduces the realism
of simulations. To date, the kinetic energy from the vorticity ﬁeld
could be transformed into positive divergence, causing the loss of
surface details and of overall dynamic motion [ZBG15]. State-of-
the-art SPH approaches for ﬂuid simulation cannot solve this prob-
lem completely.

During the advection-projection process,

the advection step
maps the original velocity ﬁeld into a rotational part and a divergent
part, after which the pressure projection removes the divergent part,
leaving only the rotational part. The angular momentum is there-
fore lost in the simulation, with the effect becoming worse as the
time step size increases; see Fig. 2, the orange part of the diagram.
To alleviate this, we use the accurate vorticity ﬁeld derived from the
curl of the Navier-Stokes equations to correct the linear velocity for
each particle; see Fig. 2, the green part of the diagram. Moreover,
we use a stream function to reﬁne the velocity using a reasonable
augmentation of the vorticity ﬁeld which can restore vivid yet con-
trollable vortices and turbulence effects (as shown in Figs. 1 and 3
among others). Previous related work [XBP∗19] looked into cor-
recting the velocity ﬁeld through the vorticity recovered from the
kinematic viscosity by increasing the vorticity ﬁeld proportionally
by the energy dissipated, which is based on the rotational kinetic
energy. In contrast, we focus on getting the ideal vorticity ﬁeld di-

Figure 2: This diagram shows how the vorticity dissipates in the
advection-projection process. Linear velocity at time step n splits
into normal (red) and tangential (green) components during the
advection procedure. Next, projection eliminates the normal com-
ponent using the pressure force to keep the ﬂow divergence-free.

rectly from the curl of the Navier-Stokes equations, which is a more
physically reasonable model.

Summarizing, the main contributions of this paper are:

• A vivid turbulence-details generation method that recovers nu-

merical dissipation through vorticity ﬁeld correction;

• A novel vorticity-based constraint and stream function solution

for simulating turbulence;

• An orthogonal solver for the SPH ﬂuid framework with turbu-
lence simulation that can be easily integrated into other particle-
based methods and ﬂuid solvers.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
gives an overview of related work. Section 3 discusses the accuracy
of numerical calculations in SPH. Our vorticity reﬁnement scheme
is presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents and discusses our ex-
perimental results. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

2. Related Work

Fluid simulation is a well researched topic in computer graphics.
Early works on this topic include [Mon94, FM96, Sta99, MCG03].
For recent overviews, we refer to Bridson’s book [Bri15] and the
state-of-the-art report of Koschier et al. [KBST19]. We further dis-
cuss more speciﬁc work related to our context, namely SPH-based
ﬂuid simulation (Sec. 2.1) and turbulence simulation (Sec. 2.2).

2.1. Incompressibility and Numerical Accuracy in SPH Fluid

Simulations

Monaghan simulated free surface ﬂows with SPH [Mon94],
which laid the foundation for ﬂuid simulation. Later, Muller et
al. [MCG03] proposed to simulate ﬂuids using the ideal gas state
equation with surface tension and viscosity forces, but without full
incompressibility. An improved weakly-compressible SPH (WC-
SPH) method was proposed by Becker and Teschner [BT07]. The
use of the stiff equation of state (EOS) signiﬁcantly increased re-
alistic effects, but the efﬁciency of such methods is limited by the
size of the used time step. To further enforce incompressibility and
improve numerical accuracy, much effort has been invested into
implicit pressure solvers. Previous approaches can be categorized

as methods that project particle positions onto an incompressible
state using iterative EOS solvers, and pressure projection meth-
ods [IOS∗14], as follows.

He et al. [HLL∗12] and Solenthaler and Pajarola [SP09] pro-
posed predictive-corrective approaches that iteratively project par-
ticle positions onto an incompressible state. This is also done in
position-based ﬂuids (PBF) [MM13]. However, PBF avoids ac-
cumulating pressure or pressure forces that eventually update the
velocity and the position. Ihmsen et al. [ICS∗14] proposed im-
plicit incompressible SPH (IISPH) following the strategy of pres-
sure projections. Separately, Bender and Koschier [BK15] pro-
posed a method that enforces a low compression (0.01% ) and a
divergence-free velocity constraint (DFSPH). Among all the vari-
ants of the SPH method, the typical advection-projection models
are PCISPH [SP09], IISPH [ICS∗14] and DFSPH [BK15]. In this
paper, we use the DFSPH approach as a baseline for comparisons
of computational efﬁciency and stability.

It

is well known that SPH approaches suffer

from nu-
merical dissipation problems, especially for coarse discretiza-
tions [Mon94, dGWH∗15, BKKW18]. Ihmsen et al. [IOS∗14]
pointed out that SPH results in undesired dissipation and high-
frequency features are smoothed out. Therefore, avoiding dissipa-
tion for turbulence in ﬂuid simulation is needed to improve visual
realism.

2.2. Restoring Turbulence in Fluid Simulation

Restoring high-frequency details has been an important challenge
in ﬂuid simulation since its very beginning [KTJG08, JSMF∗18].
For Eulerian approaches, Stam’s scheme [Sta99] ﬁrst achieved re-
alistic and real-time ﬂuid simulation on consumer-grade graphics
hardware. However, the ﬁrst-order accuracy in both time and space
makes this method (and other extensions thereof) suffer from seri-
ous numerical dissipation. Kim et al. [KLLR05] proposed a higher-
order approximation. Jonas et al. [ZNT18] proposed an advection-
reﬂection solver for detail-preserving ﬂuid animation which leads
to two orders of magnitude reduction in energy loss. Rahul et
al. [NZT19] then established a connection between this method
and the implicit midpoint time integration scheme, and presented a
simple improvement to obtain an advection-reﬂection scheme with
second-order accuracy in time.

Hybrid particle-grid methods were subsequently proposed to
further reduce numerical dissipation. Zhu and Bridsonsâ ˘A ´Z FLIP
method for incompressible ﬂow [ZB05] signiﬁcantly eliminates the
dissipation in advection. Jiang et al. [JSS∗15] successfully restore
most of the rotational motion using a hybrid method.

Although the general simulation methods mentioned above can
handle numerical dissipation on a macroscopic level, both Eulerian
and Lagrangian approaches face challenges when simulating high-
frequency details such as turbulence. Therefore, methods speciﬁ-
cally designed for reﬁning turbulent details have emerged. These

4

S. Liu & X. Wang & X. Ban et al. / Turbulent Details Simulationfor SPH Fluids via Vorticity Reﬁnement

can be classiﬁed into three categories: up-res methods, vorticity
conﬁnement methods, and Lagrangian vortex methods [BKKW18],
as follows.

pressure force may introduce vorticity errors into the velocity ﬁeld
after the projection step. Although it maintains an incompressible
density ﬁeld, it is not necessarily divergence-free.

Up-res methods add high-frequency details over a coarse dis-
cretization. Mercier et al. [MBT∗15] proposed a post-processing
method to apply ﬁne turbulence over particle-based ﬂuid sur-
faces. High-resolution surface points are seeded after curvature
evaluation, and the detailed surface waves are then evolved over
coarse particles. Edwards and Bridson [EB14] proposed an adap-
tive volumetric-mesh method for grid-based ﬂuids by using the
adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method. Machine learning meth-
ods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [CT17] have
been applied in ﬂuid simulation to synthesize high-resolution tur-
bulence on rough simulation results based on a high-resolution
source. However, training CNNs is time-consuming and often re-
quires delicate hyperparameter tuning. Overall, up-res methods can
typically improve only surface effects.

Vorticity conﬁnement methods aim to ﬁnd existing vortices and
recover their dissipation. A new forcing term is added to increase
the velocity of target positions, and to enforce the rotation, of the
vortex. Lentine et al. [LAF11] improved vorticity conﬁnement to
be both energy conserving and momentum conserving. Jang et
al. [JKB∗10] used multi-level vorticity conﬁnement to acquire bet-
ter results. Macklin and Muller [MM13] presented a simple method
to amplify the existing vorticity through accelerating particles us-
ing SPH. Overall, vorticity conﬁnement methods provide a simple
way for preserving vortices, but are in general unable to create ad-
ditional turbulence details. Moreover, they are prone to adding ex-
cessive energy to the system so that energy conservation is likely to
be violated, leading to unstable results.

Lagrangian vortex methods build on the vorticity representa-
tion of the Navier-Stokes equations [PK05], which have less nu-
merical dissipation and more divergence retention than vortic-
ity conﬁnement methods. These methods can be applied to par-
ticles [WLB∗20], curves [AN05], ﬁlaments [EWPT17], and even
surfaces [WP10]. Yet, boundaries, such as non-rigid obstacles and
free surfaces, are difﬁcult to handle. Zhu et al. [ZYF10] proposed
to simulate vortex details around moving objects using Eulerian
grids. Golas et al. [GNS∗12] also treated boundaries of an Eulerian
grid to solve this issue. A disadvantage of these methods is that
the velocity ﬁeld has to be recovered by solving the Biot-Savart
integrals or a vector-valued Poisson equation. Recently, Bender et
al. [BKKW18] introduced the MicroPolar ﬂuid solver (MP solver)
for inviscid ﬂuids in order to capture the micro-rotation of ﬂuid
particles, achieving impressive visual turbulent features. Wang et
al. [WLB∗20] proposed a turbulence reﬁnement method based on
the Rankine vortex model for particle-based simulation. Zhang et
al. [ZBG15] proposed an Integrated Vorticity of Convective Kine-
matics (IVOCK) method to restore dissipated energy by measuring
vorticity loss in advection. This method can cheaply capture much
of the lost details for smoke and ﬁre, but does not work well for
liquid simulations. In [ZBG15], only the vorticity dissipated dur-
ing the advection step is considered. The reﬁned linear velocity in
their paper is the velocity after the advection step. This velocity
is then further affected by viscosity and the projection step. Vis-
cosity may become another source of vorticity dissipation and the

Our method is inspired by the idea of stream functions [ZBG15],
extended to Lagrangian ﬂuid simulations. This allows us to efﬁ-
ciently derive velocity reﬁnement from the vorticity ﬁeld. Recov-
ering turbulence from the curl form of the Navier-Stokes equations
has a long history. In 2005, Park and Kim [PK05] gave the gov-
erning equations of the vortex method and introduced the concept
of the stream function. [ZBG15] and our work, among many other
vortex methods, utilize this concept to reduce numerical dissipation
during simulation. In our method, we derive the dissipated vorticity
during the whole advection-projection step in the SPH approach.
This can be easily done with little extra computation overhead.
With respect to the concept of the stream function, we carry out
the Biot-Savart summation process within smoothing length, which
makes it less accurate but more efﬁcient than [ZBG15]; we show
this to be sufﬁcient to maintain stability. This is because, theoret-
ically, the reﬁned velocity is the curl of the stream function, and
any curl of a vector ﬁeld is divergence-free. Moreover, we imple-
mented our method using DFSPH (Divergence-free SPH), which
includes an extra divergence-correction solver, thereby eliminating
possible errors caused by the summation process. Moreover, we do
not need to solve the Biot-Savart integrals or a vector-valued Pois-
son equation. In contrast to the MP solver [BKKW18], in which the
motion equation is obtained from the MicroPolar model and dis-
cretized with SPH, we derive the vorticity equation from the curl of
the Navier-Stokes equations, and recover velocity from the vortic-
ity ﬁeld using stream functions. Our results show that our method
can not only enhance existing vortices, but also generate turbulence
at potential locations of new vortices.

3. SPH Discretization for Fluid Simulation

Traditional Lagrangian-based ﬂuid simulations use the ﬂuid gov-
erning equations, the Navier-Stokes equations, to solve for the po-
sition and velocity of each ﬂuid particle. The acceleration of the
ﬂuid particles is obtained by the combination of pressure apres, vis-
cous force avis, and gravity ag as

Dvvv
Dt

= apres + avis + ag = −

1
ρ

∇p + νv∇2vvv + g,

(1)

where D denotes the material derivative, ρ is the density of the ﬂuid,
p represents pressure, vvv is velocity, νv is the kinematic viscosity
coefﬁcient, a value that characterizes various ﬂuid types (set to νv =
0.05 in our experiments), g is the gravitational acceleration, and ∇2
denotes the Laplace operator.

The SPH approach can be used to discretize the Navier-Stokes
equations to numerically solve them. The continuous physical val-
ues in space can be discretized using a smooth kernel W as in

A (xxxi) = ∑

(cid:107)xxxi−xxx j(cid:107)≤h

with A (xxxi) being a certain quantity associated with particle i at
location xxxi. This quantity can be interpolated from the values of
neighbour particles, indexed by j, within a support radius h. The

where x = (cid:107)xxxi − xxx j(cid:107)/h and Wi j is a short form of W (cid:0)xxxi − xxx j, h(cid:1). To
obtain a better accuracy of the approximation of the divergence of
velocity, the gradient and the curl of velocity, we apply the differ-
ence form of the SPH discretization as:

1 ≤ x ≤ 2
x ≥ 2

,

which expresses the gradient (∇A), divergence (∇ · A), and curl
(∇ × A, in which case the right hand side is negative) of A. Since
the second derivative is often sensitive to particle disorder and sign
changes inside the support radius h, we use artiﬁcial viscosity to

Simulating incompressible ﬂuids in DFSPH follows several
steps, including advection and projection, and an extra diver-
gence correction step which is applied to keep the velocity ﬁeld
divergence-free. The whole process is summarized in Algorithm 1,
where ∆t denotes the size of one time step, aadv = avis + ag, and

4. Vorticity Reﬁnement Model for Turbulence Simulation

Our method is closely related to Lagrangian vortex methods,
namely it restores the velocity ﬁeld through vorticity. In our
method, besides velocity vvv, each particle has a vector vorticity at-
tribute ζζζ deﬁned as

ζζζ = ∇ × vvv.

(5)

In a particle system, vorticity is a quantity used to describe the ro-
tation of a particle. For the vorticity at the position of particle i, the
value can be derived using Eqn. 3 as:

ζζζi = ζζζ(vvvi) = ∇ × vvvi = ∑

(b) MP solver (νt = 0.05)

(c) Our method (α = 1.0)

Given that the numerical dissipation of vorticity occurs between
time steps, an ideal non-dissipative rate of change of vorticity is
required to know the exact vorticity loss in each projection step. We
achieve this through the curl of the Navier-Stokes equation (Eqn.1)
as:

∇ ×

(cid:19)

(cid:18) Dvvv

= ζζζ · ∇vvv + νv∇2ζζζ,

(7)

where ζζζ · ∇vvv is the stretching term, which is vital for physically
meaningful turbulence motion evolution. We use Eqn. 7 to obtain
the exact non-dissipative vorticity change of ﬂuid particles between
time steps, including boundary treatment [AIA∗12].

Note that ζζζ · ∇vvv in Eqn. 7 is a vector, which we compute, per
coordinate, using the difference form of the SPH approximation
(Eqn. 3) via

where vx

i is the x component of the velocity of particle with index
i, and similarly for y and z. For the particle with index i, the vector
ζζζi · ∇vvvi can be thus derived as

The Laplacian of ζζζ in Eqn. 7 is derived using the artiﬁcial approx-
imation analogous to Eqn. 4. Hence, for the particle with index i,
νv∇2ζζζi can be derived as

our method (α = 1.0 and α = 1.2) for a simulation of a stick (rod)
mixing water. Besides turbulence enhancement, our method stands
out in keeping the ﬂow trail visible and maintaining the stability
of the surface. As visible, the MP solver and our solver can obtain
different enhancement results.

4.1. Vorticity Reﬁnement

Similarly to the divergence error issue [BK15], vorticity dissipa-
tion can also hinder the performance of a simulation. Recent SPH
approaches [ICS∗14, BK15] for ﬂuid animation can only correct
negative divergence of the velocity ﬁeld. As a result, the kinetic en-
ergy from the vorticity ﬁeld is still allowed to be transformed into
positive divergence during simulation, causing the loss of surface
details and overall dynamic motions, effectively violating (the dis-
crete version of) Eqn. 5.

According to Eqn. 7, the ideal change of the vorticity ﬁeld with

respect to time, i.e., from time tn to tn+1, is:
Dζζζn
Dt

ζζζn+1 = ζζζn + ∆t

,

and the dissipative vorticity update is given by:

∆ζζζ = ζζζn+1 − ∇ × ˜vvv,

(11)

(12)

where ˜vvv is the (intermediate) velocity, as in the last line of Algo-
rithm 1.

We next explain how we apply the update of Eqn. 12. Assume
that we know the velocity and position of all ﬂuid particles at time
tn, and that the velocity at this time step is non-dissipative. We then
get the velocity and position at time tn+1 using the DFSPH ap-
proach. Next, we compute the vorticity at the current time tn and
the next time tn+1, denoted ζζζn and ˜ζζζ, respectively, from the ve-
locity ﬁeld using Eqn. 6. By our assumption, ζζζn is ideal, but ˜ζζζ
is dissipative due to numerical integration. Thus the ideal vortic-
ity value for a ﬂuid particle at tn+1, denoted ζζζn+1, is computed
based on ζζζn and the vorticity equation (Eqn. 7). Hence, the dissipa-
tive vorticity value for this particle in Eqn. 12 can be converted to
∆ζζζ = ζζζn+1 − ˜ζζζ. The dissipated vorticity is used to reﬁne the velocity
using the stream function, as explained next.

4.2. Solving Velocity via the Stream Function

Inspired by [ZB14], we express the relationship between the veloc-
ity vvv and the vorticity ζζζ using the stream function ψψψ as:

vvv =∇ × ψψψ,
∇2ψψψ = −ζζζ.

(13)

Greenâ ˘A ´Zs function provides a semi-analytical solution for the
stream function. The derivation from the stream function to linear
velocity can be solved using Eqn. 3. Generalized by the Helmholtz
decomposition, the stream function is the vector potential ψψψ of the
velocity ﬁeld vvv, which can be deﬁned as

ψψψ(xxx) =

(cid:90)

R3

∇ × vvv(yyy)
4π (cid:107)xxx − yyy(cid:107)

,

(14)

that is, the stream function ψψψ at position xxx is computed by integrat-
ing the curl of velocity vvv at position yyy over the three-dimensional

where Vj stands for the volume represented by the particle with
index j. Ideally, Vj should be inﬁnitely small and all distances (cid:107)xxxi −

only include neighbouring particles within a smoothing radius h in
Eqn. 15. This is justiﬁed by the fact that the inﬂuence of neighbour
particles shrinks with distance. Although the approximation could
potentially induce instability and dissipation, our results show that
this improves performance without sacriﬁcing turbulent details, as
already observed e.g. in [MCG03].

With the stream function obtained for each particle, the reﬁned

velocity for the particle with index i is derived as

∆vvvi = ∑
j

m j
ρ j

× ∇Wi j.

(16)

To extend the ﬂexibility of our method, we introduce an adjust-
ment parameter α ∈ R, with the default value of 1 representing
the ideal vorticity reﬁnement. It controls the amount of turbulence
added to every simulation time step. Therefore the reﬁned linear
velocity at tn+1 is expressed as

vvvn+1 = ˜vvv + α∆vvv.

(17)

Since the divergence of the curl of any ﬁeld is zero, the correction
of linear velocity due to vorticity does not cause any further diver-
gence deviations. Hence, our method does not contradict any SPH
principles, making it easier to implement into standard Lagrangian
approaches. Algorithm 2 summarizes our method, integrated with
the DFSPH technique for SPH simulation; see also Fig. 2.

5. Results and Discussion

We next test our novel Vortex Reﬁnement (VR) method on sev-
eral scenes, comparing it with the state-of-the-art micropolar (MP)
model and classical SPH approaches.

Both the VR and the MP method are integrated with DFSPH in
the following experiments to show the applicability of our method.
We used the boundary handling method proposed by Akinci et al.
[AIA∗12]. We implemented the entire framework in C++, with an-
imations rendered by Blender. Our simulation platform is a graphic
workstation with an Intel Xeon E5-2687w v4 (15M cache, 3.5 GHz,
12 cores) CPU, 80 GB RAM, and an NVIDIA Quadro P4000 GPU.

Similarly to the adjustment parameter α in our method, there is
a scalar νt in the MP method to control it. Based on the mechanism
of the MP method [Eri66, BKKW18], νt greater than νv can poten-
tially violate the second law of thermodynamics. In all experiments
below we set νv = 0.05. We therefore choose νt = 0.05 as a nat-
ural reﬁnement for the MP solver, which corresponds to α = 1 in
our method. However, to explore the stability and performance of
the methods, we test α greater than 1 and νt greater than 0.05; see
Figs. 5 and 9. As stated in [BKKW18], ﬂuids are reasonably stable
when νt ≤ 0.4.

5.1. Effectiveness and Comparison

To show the effectiveness of our approach numerically, we exe-
cuted two breaking-dam experiments, and we executed two other
experiments for parameter discussion and energy comparison with
other methods, as follows.

Breaking dam with a board. In Figs. 1 and 3, a board collides with
a breaking dam which only allows ﬂuid to go through the so-created
gap. Figure 3 shows the results with 1.18M particles. Only few vor-
tex effects can be seen using DFSPH. Water ﬂushes through the gap
and dissipates quickly without clear turbulence effects. Compared
to DFSPH, our solver generates several realistic vortices around
the board and corners. The MP solver also improves the visual re-
sult, but not as obviously as our method. Since our method reﬁnes
particle velocity based on the vorticity ﬁeld, vortices are naturally
preserved and turbulence is generated from the dissipated energy
in a realistic way. In Fig. 4, the vorticity magnitude of all parti-
cles is visualized. The comparison shows that both our method and
the MP method yield higher energy values than DFSPH. The MP
solver adds energy in a natural way, while our method recovers en-
ergy from numerical dissipation more effectively and is thus able
to simulate more details.

Breaking dam with three obstacles. As shown in Fig. 11, a break-
ing dam scenario with static obstacles was tested using 457K ﬂuid
particles. The ﬂuid ﬂows in from the left and hits the wall on the
right. Several waves are generated in the process, which then come
back and interact with three rigid bodies. Desirable turbulence can
be observed over the surface. We compared our method with the
DFSPH and MP solvers. In DFSPH, the ﬂuid seems to go around
the pillars and forms splashes, but scarcely any complex turbulence
effects. In contrast, our solver creates small-scale vortices instead
of just the ﬂuid smoothly ﬂowing around the pillars. Since these
small vortices cannot sustain a self-spinning state, they quickly
break down into turbulence. Compared to the MP solver in this
scene, our method seems to generate more turbulent details but
smaller vortices. The MP solver and our method can achieve dif-
ferent visual effects.

Energy Comparison. An energy comparison of a breaking dam
experiment (see Fig. 8) is shown in Fig. 7. The left plot shows the
energy comparison, while the right plot shows the energy increase
ratio relative to DFSPH. When t ∈ [2, 8], the ﬂuid keeps ﬂowing
and forming turbulence. If the energy is larger than that of DFSPH,
then energy is recovered (or added) successfully. After the water
surface calms down (after about 10s), the scene should contain only
potential energy (no kinetic energy). The energy of the traditional
DFPSH method can be used as a benchmark: If a method gener-
ates, at this time point, more energy than DFSPH, then this method
is considered to create additional energy. In this comparison ex-
periment, the energy values after 10s for both the MP solver with
νt = 0.05, 0.1 and for our method with α = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 are very
close to the DFSPH values. Our method with α = 1.3 and the MP
method with νt = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 have higher energy than DFSPH. In
some applications, in order to enhance the visual effect, one can use
such larger parameter values. However, this can very likely cause
excessive chaos and even instability such as unnatural turbulence
similar to boiling. Hence, we recommend to use our method with
α = 1.0 to ensure the energy is always in line with the underlying
physics.

Breaking dam with a hemisphere: parameter inﬂuence. In this
experiment (see Fig. 9) we ﬂush a hemisphere obstacle with a ﬁxed
volume of ﬂuid. This means only limited kinetic energy is involved
in this scenario (from gravitational potential energy). We simulated
the ﬂow using DFSPH, our method with α = 1 and α = 1.2, and
the MP solver with νt = 0.05, νt = 0.2 and νt = 0.4. When com-
paring the DFSPH approach with our method with α = 1 and with
MP with νt = 0.05, both methods are able to increase the turbu-
lence performance, but our result is more pronounced than the MP
one. To obtain more obvious turbulence effects, we increase the
turbulence control parameters in the two methods, which means
that more energy is added to the simulation. The renderings show
that our method with α = 1.2 yields more turbulence and the re-
sult is better than that of the MP solver with vt = 0.2. To keep our
method in line with the underlying physics, as explained for the ear-
lier example, we do not use higher parameter values. The MP solver
adds more turbulence in this scene. The obtained results are visu-
ally more salient for large parameter values, e.g. νt = 0.2. However,
νt cannot be increased indeﬁnitely. For example, if we set νt = 0.4
(Fig. 9, last row), the ﬂuid does not calm down, which is unnatural.
The detailed energy comparison is shown in Fig. 10. Our method

Figure 7: Comparison of energy changes for different methods using different parameter values in the breaking dam scene shown in Fig. 8.
Left: direct energy comparison. Right: energy increase ratio relative to DFSPH. When the ﬂuid is ﬂowing (t ∈ [2, 8]), our method and the MP
solver are able to add energy to the scene and enhance the visual effect. However, the MP solver with νt = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and our method with
α = 1.3 do not converge after t = 8 due to the excessive energy added.

DFSPH. Both our method and the MP method enhance the visual
effect. In contrast to the MP method, our method adds energy in a
physically reasonable way (no turbulence in front of the propeller)
and creates vivid turbulent details over the free ﬂuid surface. The
key areas are zoomed in on. Also, a vortex is observed with our
method after the propeller has stopped spinning (see also the sup-
plementary video).

Boat-sinking. In this scenario, a boat and two columns interact
with a breaking dam. Figure 6 shows the results using 1.7M ﬂuid
particles. The potential energy of the ﬂuid transforms into the ki-
netic energy of the ﬂuid particles and the boat. The water is ﬁrst
violently displaced when it hits the column and the boat, and next
gradually calms down as time goes by, ﬁnally reaching a stable
state. We see that the DFSPH method produces relatively weakly
turbulent details, which get lost quickly due to numerical dissipa-
tion. In contrast, our method and MP server shows more natural
dynamics with realistic turbulent effects on the ﬂuid surface. The
ﬂuid gradually calms down as time goes on. Our method and the
MP method achieve different styles.

Stirring water. In Fig. 5, a cylindrical stick was inserted into a
tank of water, and stirred at a uniform speed for several seconds.
The water splashed around due to the quick movement of the stick.
Observe that the trace left on the surface lasts longer in our method
than with the MP method, which is a critical point for boat-sailing
animation scenarios. After the stirring process, the stick is pulled
out of the ﬂuid, and the water starts to calm down. The DFSPH ap-
proach calms the ﬂuid down quickly due to numerical dissipation.
The surface details are clearer and sharper in our method. Also, we
notice a disturbance wave in the MP method, caused by the fact that
νt exceeds the kinematic viscosity.

The above three scenarios show that our method can keep sta-
bility when dealing with extreme conditions like strong collisions,
while physically preserving energy. Moreover, in the accompany-

Figure 8: A breaking dam scenario for the evaluation of energy
changes (461K ﬂuid particles); see Fig. 7.

can be applied to scenes that are more sensitive to physics laws,
such as adding more details to a relatively stably-ﬂowing scene. In
contrast, the MP method can be used in scenes where one wants to
create a stronger visual impact, such as collapses or violent shocks.

Overall, this experiment shows that the MP solver and our solver
can achieve different turbulence effects. Our method achieves bet-
ter turbulence results without adding energy sources. In contrast,
the MP solver can add small vortices, but when increasing its pa-
rameter values, energy sources will pop up and prevent the ﬂuid
from calming down.

5.2. Quality

To further demonstrate the turbulence quality of our method, we
simulated several complex scenarios with dynamic boundary con-
ditions and compared them with the MP solver.

Spinning Propeller. A propeller is slowly submerged into water,
after which it starts spinning at 3 radians per second. Fig. 12 shows
the results of this simulation using 1.29M ﬂuid particles for DF-
SPH, MP, and VR (our method). Observe that neither the complex
ﬂow nor strong turbulence effects are produced and preserved using

ing video it can be seen that our method not only ampliﬁes existing
vortices but also generates new ones.

Computational overhead. The computational overhead of our
method is negligible compared to the whole SPH simulation pro-
cedure. Table 1 shows the computing times for DFSPH, the MP
solver, and our method for different simulation scenes. The dif-
ferent computation times are explained as follows. Compared to
DFSPH, both turbulence methods (MP and ours) need to compute

the vorticity ﬁeld, i.e., solve for the Laplacian ∇2ζζζ. Further, ∇ × ζζζ
(in the MP solver) and ∇vvv (in our method) also need to be solved
for. The difference is that our method needs to compute ψψψ(ζζζ) and
∇ × ψψψ to get the reﬁned velocity, but as Table 1 shows, the extra
computational effort is negligible.

The water hits the cylinders and the right wall and bounces back,

gives rise to tiny vortices instead of the water simply going around
the pillars. Compared to the MP solver, our method seems to pro-
vide more turbulent details but smaller vortices in this scene.

ods. Our method can simulate typical turbulent scenes efﬁciently
and is relatively stable even for scenarios with highly turbulent
ﬂow. At the same time, we should note that some vorticity is lost
in such cases. While this small amount of loss does not affect the
general visual quality, decreasing it is an open topic for future re-
search, which can be expected to lead to even more realistic ﬂuid
simulations.

In the future, we aim to investigate merging our method with mi-
crostructural models, since these models show great potential for
rough simulation conditions and also have a close relationship with
viscosity. Improving computation accuracy is another potential fu-
ture research direction. Finally, increasing the computational scal-
ability of our method by e.g. efﬁcient and effective parallelization
is attractive for making our method directly applicable to complex
real-world and/or interactive simulations.

νt = 0.2, 0.4 does not converge after t = 15.

6. Conclusion and Discussion

We have presented a particle-based turbulence reﬁnement method
that recovers lost velocity from the difference between the theoreti-
cal and the actual vorticity value. Our method can not only increase
existing vortices signiﬁcantly by recovering numerical dissipation,
but also generates new turbulence at potentially different locations.
The turbulence-enhancement parameter of our method has a theo-
retically optimal value α = 1 that can increase turbulence without
adding too much energy. At the same time, one can easily adjust
this parameter to achieve different turbulence levels for different
simulation effects.

Experimental results show that, compared to the classical and
micropolar SPH methods, our method is able to enhance turbulent
effects more visibly. Furthermore, our method guarantees energy
conservation, even when using a large particle radius and/or a large
time step. This means that our method is still robust even under
extreme simulation conditions and can handle complex large-scale
scenes, as demonstrated in our simulation scenarios.

Numerical dissipation is difﬁcult to fully correct in SPH meth-
