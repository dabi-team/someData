Abstract. Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) is an important part of
VR applications. Many scientists are enriching the community with dif-
ferent variations that enable locomotion in VR. Some of the most promis-
ing methods are gesture-based and do not require additional handheld
hardware. Recent work focused mostly on user preference and perfor-
mance of the diﬀerent locomotion techniques. This ignores the learning
eﬀect that users go through while new methods are being explored. In
this work, it is investigated whether and how quickly users can adapt to
a hand gesture-based locomotion system in VR. Four diﬀerent locomo-
tion techniques are implemented and tested by participants. The goal of
this paper is twofold: First, it aims to encourage researchers to consider
the learning eﬀect in their studies. Second, this study aims to provide
insight into the learning eﬀect of users in gesture-based systems.

Introduction

Intuitive locomotion is an essential part of VR research and its applications. Usu-
ally a controller is used for virtual locomotion [1,8,5], but more recent work uses
other techniques such as vision-based tracking [7] or sensors that are attached
to the body [6,4]. The controller-based methods are extensively researched and
already in commercial use. Gesture-based locomotion is getting more attention
lately and requires more research to ﬁnd out which methods are adequate. Many
studies focus entirely on subjective user preference in researching and developing
such locomotion systems. Moreover, studies related to locomotion in VR usually
use a single ”ease-to-learn” question for participants to ﬁnd out if the technique
is easy to learn. This article addresses another important factor that is often

neglected. Namely, how quickly people can learn such a system. Complicated
methods lead to longer times to achieve objectives and ultimately to user frus-
tration. Therefore, attention should be paid to whether or not users can quickly
adapt to implemented techniques.

To investigate the learning eﬀect, a user study with 21 participants was con-
ducted. Four diﬀerent locomotion techniques based on hand gestures were imple-
mented and tested by each participant. People with minor and no background
in VR were recruited in order to remove additional bias or knowledge regarding
VR systems. This article focuses on the learning eﬀect that can be observed
among these lay people. More concrete, this work answers the following research
questions:

Do lay people signiﬁcantly improve their task completion time when using hand
gesture based locomotion during a second session compared to the ﬁrst?

How much do lay people adapt to the limitations of a hand tracking device after

a ﬁrst trial session?

Will lay people signiﬁcantly improve their eﬃciency (less number of teleporta-
tions) when using hand gesture based locomotion during a second trial ses-
sion?

This article is organized as follows: In section 2 relevant articles about the
learning eﬀect in VR locomotion are provided. The locomotion techniques used
for the experiment are introduced in section 3. In section 4 the experiment is
described and section 5 the research questions are answered. Finally, the results
are discussed in section 6 and concluded in section 7.

2 Background and Related Work

To the best of our knowledge, no paper was published that is focused on inves-
tigating the learning eﬀect of lay people for hand gesture based VR locomotion.
However, some work mentions learning eﬀect during their studies.

Zhao et al. [9] investigated diﬀerent techniques to control locomotion speed.
The gestures included Finger Distance, Finger Number, and Finger Tapping.
Users were asked within a questionnaire to subjectively evaluate the ease-to-
learn. According to the results, users found the proposed techniques easy to
learn. However, no quantitative analysis was performed to gain insights into the
learning eﬀect of participants.

Zielasko et al. [10] implemented and evaluated ﬁve diﬀerent hands-free navi-
gation methods for VR. The techniques included Walking In Place, Accelerator
Pedal, Leaning, Shake Your Head, and Gamepad. Using a questionnaire, the
authors came to the conclusion that the introduced techniques are easy to learn.
Kitson et al. [3] introduced NaviChair, a chair based locomotion technique
for virtual environments. Users were required to move within the chair to get dif-
ferent locomotion eﬀects. The authors compared this technique with a technique

Learning Eﬀect of Lay People in Gesture-Based Locomotion...

based on a joystick. During exit interviews, it was revealed that the joystick
variant is preferred by users because it was more accurate and easier to learn.

The work of Keil et al. [2] used VR locomotion techniques to measure users’
learning eﬀect in distance estimations. The authors found a signiﬁcant decrease
in distance estimation errors after a subsequent task.

This paper does not rely on a subjective questionnaire to answer whether
techniques are easy to learn. Instead, gathered data was quantitatively analysed
to measure the learning eﬀect of users.

3 Locomotion Techniques

In this section the locomotion techniques used for the experiment are introduced.
Four diﬀerent locomotion techniques, two two-handed and two one-handed, were
implemented. All techniques are hand gesture-based and do not require controller
or other handheld hardware. For details of the implementation of the proposed
techniques, the reader is referred to the work of Sch¨afer et al. [7]. In the following
text these four techniques are referenced as TwoHandIndex, TwoHandPalm,
OneHandIndex, and OneHandPalm. These techniques are depicted in Figure 1.

Fig. 1. The four locomotion techniques used for experiments. The two-handed tech-
niques use one hand for choosing a destination and the other hand for activating the
teleport via gestures. The one-handed techniques use one hand to choose the destina-
tion and the teleport is activated if the hand is kept still.

TwoHandIndex This method requires the user to use both hands for moving
through a virtual environment. The index ﬁnger on the right hand is used to
choose a teleport destination. If the left hand performs a certain gesture, telepor-
tation to the chosen destination is performed. The gesture consists of bending
and straightening the index ﬁnger, similar to a pointing gesture.

TwoHandPalm This method is similar to the TwoHandIndex technique. How-
ever, instead of using the index ﬁnger for navigation, the palm is used.

OneHandIndex Only one hand for navigation as well as performing teleportation
is used for this technique. When a pointing gesture is found, a ray emanating
from the tip of the index ﬁnger is activated. After the ray is visible, teleportation
will be performed after the hand is held still for 1.5 s.

OneHandedPalm Similar to OneHandIndex, only one hand is used for locomo-
tion. Instead of a pointing gesture, this technique uses the palm for navigation.
As soon as the user opens his hand, a ray emanates from the centre of the palm.
The teleportation is triggered after the hand is held still for 1.5 s.

4 Experiment

4.1 Objectives

The objective of the experiment was to answer the question whether users are
able to quickly learn hand gesture based locomotion. More precise, the research
questions mentioned in section 1 should be answered. Four techniques to control
locomotion in VR with hand gestures were implemented and performed by users.
Task completion time was used to measure the eﬃciency of the user with diﬀerent
techniques. Additionally, the number of teleportations required to reach the goal
and the number of times the hand tracking failed was collected to measure
improvements by the users.

4.2 Participants

The study was performed with 21 volunteers (15 Male, 6 Female). The sub-
jects’ age ranged between 25 and 60 years (M = 35.4, M edian = 31). A 5-point
Likert-scale (1 denotes less knowledge and 5 expert knowledge) was used as
a preliminary questionnaire to assess the experience of participants within the
relevant subject areas. 81 % of participants answered that they have good ex-
perience in software and computer (they answered with 4 or 5). Regarding VR
experience, 86 % of users have never worn a VR-HMD before and the remaining
14 % used a VR headset at least once.

4.3 Apparatus

The experiment was performed by using a gaming notebook. Hand tracking was
provided by the Leap Motion Controller. Samsung Odyssey+ was used as the
VR-HMD.

4.4 Experimental Task

Participants had to touch ten pillar-like objects in a virtual environment. These
objects were placed at ﬁxed positions in a large corridor (10 m high, 10 m broad
and 100 m long) with no obstacles other than the touchable pillar-like objects
as depicted Figure 2A.

Participants were required to move towards the pillars with the locomotion
techniques proposed in section 3. Once the user was close enough, a pillar could
be touched and its color changed to indicate it was touched (Figure 2B). The
task was completed once the participant touched all 10 pillars in the VE. The
task was repeated for each technique. The experiment was conducted in seating
position.

corridor. (B) Participant touching a pillar and changing its color to green.

4.5 Procedure

The experiment had a within-subjects design. Each trial session was performed
individually with the 21 subjects. The experiment was split into two phases:
Learning phase and evaluation phase. In both phases, the participants had to
move through the environment and perform the experimental task. In the learn-
ing, as well as the evaluation phase, all four techniques were used by the partici-
pants. Both phases are identical in terms of task and VE. The diﬀerence between
the two phases is the order of techniques, which was counterbalanced between
participants in the evaluation phase. In the learning phase, participants have
performed each technique for the ﬁrst time. Therefore, data is collected where
users performed each technique for the ﬁrst and the second time. A trial session
lasted about 43 minutes.

5 Answering the Research Questions

Data was collected during the experiment to answer the research questions.
No questionnaire regarding learning experience was given to the participants

and our ﬁndings are based solely on quantitative results. Task completion time
measured the time a participant required to complete the task. More precisely,
it represents the time from touching the ﬁrst pillar to the last inside the VE.
Additionally, the number of times the hand tracking was lost was collected.
This value represents the tracking failures of the chosen device. The tracking
failed if the participant moved a hand out of the reliable tracking range of the
device. For two-handed locomotion techniques, both hands had to be tracked
by the sensor and for one-handed techniques only the dominant hand had to be
tracked. This measure is particularly useful to measure the adaption of the user
to overcome the limitations of the tracking device. Furthermore, the number of
teleportations a user required to reach the goal was collected. The raw values
such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum are shown
in Table 1. One-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis and throughout
the paper signiﬁcance at the 0.05 level is reported.

ber of times the hand tracking was lost during a session, and number
of teleportations required to complete the task is shown.

5.1 Do lay people signiﬁcantly improve their task completion time

when using hand gesture based locomotion during a second
session compared to the ﬁrst?

To answer this question, the task completion time was taken into account. Lev-
ene’s test was conducted in order to ensure homogeneity of the input data
(p > 0.05). One-way ANOVA was used in order to answer whether users are
faster at completing the given task after performing a training. A comparison
was made between the learning phase of each technique and the correspond-
ing evaluation phase. The average values are depicted in Figure 3. The results
of the ANOVAs are: TwoHandIndex: F (1, 40) = 12.38, p = 0.001; TwoHand-
Palm: F (1, 40) = 8.298, p = 0.006; OneHandIndex: F (1, 40) = 2.04, p = 0.161;
OneHandPalm: F (1, 40) = 0.144, p = 0.707.

The results showed signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the task completion time for the
techniques TwoHandIndex and TwoHandPalm with p < 0.05. The techniques
OneHandIndex and OneHandPalm did not show signiﬁcance with p > 0.05.
Therefore, it can be concluded that users performed signiﬁcantly faster after
conducting a learning phase for the two-handed techniques. The one-handed
techniques however did not show signiﬁcant improvements.

5.2 How much do lay people adapt to the limitations of a hand

tracking device after a ﬁrst trial session?

Today, hand tracking devices have several limitations such as occlusion, low ﬁeld
of view, and tracking range. Scientists working in this ﬁeld know these limitations
and already avoid them unconsciously. Non-experts who have never been exposed

onds. Signiﬁcance Levels: *** = 0.001; ** = 0.01; * = 0.05; NS = No Signiﬁcance.

to this technology will discover many of these limitations. This inevitably leads
to many tracking errors until the user becomes aware of why the system has
problems. For this reason, the number of times the hand tracking failed during
a session was used as an indicator to answer this research question. Once the
user’s hands were no longer tracked, it was considered a loss of hand tracking. It
can be said that users unconsciously and unintentionally move their hands out of
the sensor’s FOV because they are not accustomed to the technology. Therefore,
this metric was used as an indicator of lay peoples learning eﬀect of the chosen
techniques. The average values are depicted in Figure 4. One-way ANOVA was
used to ﬁnd signiﬁcant improvements between the learning and evaluation phase.
Levene’s test assured homogeneity of the input data.

The result of the ANVOAs are: TwoHandIndex: F (1, 40) = 12.69, p = 0.001;
TwoHandPalm: F (1, 40) = 5.727, p = 0.021; OneHandIndex: F (1, 40) = 2.003, p =
0.165; OneHandPalm: F (1, 40) = 1.898, p = 0.176.

These results indicate, that the two-handed techniques showed signiﬁcant
improvements between the learning phase and the evaluation phase. The one-
handed techniques did not show signiﬁcance. The two-handed techniques show
overall increased tracking errors compared to the one-handed techniques. There-
fore, it can be concluded that people perform better when using one-handed
techniques. However, users are also able to signiﬁcantly improve with the two-
handed techniques by only doing one prior session with the technique.

5.3 Will lay people signiﬁcantly improve their eﬃciency (less
number of teleportations) when using hand gesture based
locomotion during a second trial session?

To answer this question, the number of teleportations was considered. Levene’s
test was conducted in order to ensure homogeneity of the input data. One-
way ANOVA was used to identify signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the learning
and evaluation phase of the experiment. The learning phase of each technique

was compared with the corresponding evaluation phase. The average values are
depicted in Figure 5. The result of the ANOVAs are: TwoHandIndex: F (1, 40) =
3.214, p = 0.08; TwoHandPalm: F (1, 40) = 0.001, p = 0.971; OneHandIndex:
F (1, 40) = 0.001, p = 0.975; OneHandPalm: F (1, 40) = 0.008, p = 0.931.

According to the one-way ANOVAs, there was no signiﬁcant improvement
observed for individual techniques between learning and evaluation phase (p >
0.05). Therefore, no learning eﬀect could be observed in teleportation behavior.

6 Discussion

The participants showed a signiﬁcant improvement in task completion time for
the two-handed techniques. The use of one-handed techniques showed no signiﬁ-
cant improvement between the ﬁrst and second phase of the experiment. During

10

Alexander Sch¨afer et al.

the experiment, subjects already expressed that one-handed techniques seem to
be more intuitive and henceforth would explain these results. However, after
performing the two-handed techniques for a second time, there was already sig-
niﬁcant improvement noticeable. This result is also backed by the fact that users
signiﬁcantly improved in regards to hand tracking failures. In the ﬁrst phase, the
users were uneasy because they ﬁrst had to understand the limitations of the
hand tracker. In the second phase, a clear improvement was noticeable. The num-
ber of teleportations required to reach the goal did not signiﬁcantly vary between
learning and evaluation phase. This could mean that the users understood how
to achieve the goal and the task was straightforward to understand.

7 Conclusion

This paper investigated the learning eﬀect of lay people performing hand gesture-
based locomotion. A user study with 21 participants was conducted. In this
study, four locomotion methods were utilised and the experiment was divided
into a learning phase and an evaluation phase. All four methods were carried
out twice by the subjects. The ﬁrst time a method was performed was referred
to as the learning phase and the second time as the evaluation phase. The study
revealed signiﬁcant improvements for the subjects while using two-handed tech-
niques. The participants were considerably faster and signiﬁcantly improved at
using the hand tracking device. Therefore, it can be said that users struggle
at ﬁrst and then, with just one more trial run, they can signiﬁcantly adapt
to gesture-based systems with two hands. Furthermore, no signiﬁcant learning
eﬀect was observed using one-handed techniques.
