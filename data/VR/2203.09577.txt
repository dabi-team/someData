ABSTRACT

We contribute MolecuSense, a virtual version of a physical molecule
construction kit, based on visualization in Virtual Reality (VR) and
interaction with force-feedback gloves. Targeting at chemistry edu-
cation, our goal is to make virtual molecule structures more tangi-
ble. Results of an initial user study indicate that the VR molecular
construction kit was positively received. Compared to a physical
construction kit, the VR molecular construction kit is on the same
level in terms of natural interaction. Besides, it fosters the typical
digital advantages though, such as saving, exporting, and sharing of
molecules. Feedback from the study participants has also revealed
potential future avenues for tangible molecule visualizations.

1 INTRODUCTION

3D models of molecules play a fundamental role in chemistry, both
in chemical education and in the frontier research, as the spacial
structures signiﬁcantly aid the understanding of molecular reactiv-
ity and properties. Traditionally, in the pre-digital ages, physical
models, often implemented as ball-and-stick models, have been
used extensively. In the recent two decades, this way of represent-
ing molecular models was more and more superseded by computer
graphics approaches.

Nevertheless, the traditional physical model bears a lot of advan-
tages, being literally more tangible and offering direct structural
manipulations like rotations around bonds which in a natural way
allow to explore the conformational space of the molecules. On
the other hand, the physical models have some limitations, they
become fragile and hard to handle at some larger scale, are difﬁcult
to store, to replicate or to share over large distances. On the contrary,
the molecular construction software can avoid these disadvantages,
and allow to precisely manipulate the position and conformation
of the atom cluster to create the structures that are more in line
with expectations. However, mouse-based interaction and the 2D
screens might hinder spatial and haptic thinking in 3D molecular
construction tasks.

Ideally, we would like to get a tool, that combines the beneﬁts
of these two approaches, by combining tangible experience creat-
ing these models with the digital amenities. In collaboration with
chemistry researchers, we thus decided to set out to explore how
Virtual Reality (VR) and force-feedback gloves could be used as an
alternative for creating and interacting with ball-and-stick molecules.
To test this idea, we built a VR-based prototype using the HTC
VIVE for output, and force-feedback SenseGloves as input. The

SenseGloves [2] enable users to grasp virtual objects by controlling
motors on the ﬁnger joints and thus have the potential to offer a
better presence than ordinary VR controllers [15]. While there exists
a plethora of molecule visualization in VR [8, 17], we hypothesized
that offering such force-feedback could make for an increased usabil-
ity and user experience, as existing approaches using stylus-based
feedback systems did [6, 14, 16, 25]. The idea is that interactions
such as grasping, holding, and manipulating are becoming more
natural and comparable to the current physical approach.

In summary, our work makes the following contributions:
• The design and implementation of the MolecuSense prototype,

that leverages VR and force-feedback.

• A preliminary usability evaluation of MolecuSense, revealing
some insights into the usage of modern force-feedback gloves
for virtual ball-and-stick molecules.

2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

In addition to the classic molecular construction kits, in which users
assemble the parts by hand, there are now also some computer pro-
grams for modelling molecules. With these programs, not only sim-
ple molecules can be formed, but far more complex calculations and
visualizations can be done depending on the focus. Avogadro [12],
for example, an open source program, supports the dynamic loading
of plug-ins and can therefore always be expanded, so that new types
of visualization can be viewed. Whereas traditional molecular visual-
izers show molecules in front of you, Molecular Rift, a VR molecule
construction kit presented by Norrby et al. [18], lets the user enter
the the interior of molecules and explore the unique and realistic 3D
effects offered by the VR. They developed a gesture-controlled VR
program to easily create molecules for drugs development, which
demonstrates its potential when investigating various molecular sys-
tems, and received very positive feedback from several focus groups.
One possibility to increase immersion in VR systems is the in-
tegration of haptic feedback. According to Ramsamy et al. [20],
presence and efﬁciency are increased when users can feel and touch
virtual objects. The means used to generate haptic feedback range
from devices placed on ﬁngertips to exoskeletal gloves. Exoskeletal
gloves, such as the SenseGlove [2] used in our study, cannot give
a feeling about the mass of the virtual objects, but it enables the
users to perceive the shape of virtual objects.The SoftGlove [23],
a further development of the SenseGlove, contains an exoskeleton
that lies over the hand and a size-adjustable glove with vibration
motors attached to it to improve the force feedback, i.e. the forces
acting on the individual ﬁngers and the ﬁt. In addition, more stable
ﬁngertip caps have been added to distribute the pressure evenly. This
prototype shows that immersion in VR can be improved by haptic
feedback, but also needs to be reﬁned in many areas.

Most closely related to our work are approaches that seek to incor-
porate haptic and force feedback into the construction of molecules.
Historical endeavors into that direction used mostly hand-grasped,
stylus-based, grounded devices [21]. Such approaches were found to
potentially enhance the spatial visualization [25]. Besides, such hap-
tic devices might provide force-torque feedback [14], and amplify
the atomic force in the molecular environment for better perception,
and eventually help the users ﬁnd the best docking position [6,16]. In
MolecuSense, we expand this line of research by looking at modern

 
 
 
 
 
 
force-feedback gloves as an input device, which provides a physical
perception about the shape of atoms and molecules.

3 PROTOTYPICAL DESIGN
For MolecuSense, we seek to combine digital amenities with the
tangible experience of molecule construction. To address that, we
visualize the atoms and their chemical bonds with a traditional ball-
and-stick model [26] in VR. The force-feedback gloves are used to
interactively generate and manipulate the molecule models.

3.1 Design Principles and Requirements
A molecule visualized in the ball-and-stick model consists of atoms
(balls) and bonds (sticks) connecting them. The chemical element
of each atom is indicated by the ball’s color and size; an example is
shown in Figure 2(b). The angles between sticks on the same atom
should be identical to the bond angles. Abstractly, we can think of
such models as a constrained 3D node-link diagram.

Existing graphical user interface of digital tools, such as TmoleX
[10, 24] and Avogadro [12], have sought to re-use this ball-and-stick
metaphor. By analyzing physical and digital tools, we have summa-
rized a list of basic tasks to interact with ball-and-stick models:

• T1. Creating/removing an atom.
• T2. Constructing a molecule by linking the atoms.
• T3. Moving/rotating a molecule.
• T4. Editing an existing molecule via an operation panel.
• T5. Saving/loading a molecule.

3.2 Visual Design
In MolecuSense, the atoms are represented by 3D spheres and chemi-
cal bonds by sticks, just as in the real physical model. For each atom,
we reserved a certain number of vacancies to build bonds, according
to the chemical valencies of that atom, which is its capability of
forming a certain number of chemical bonds, for instance, four for
Carbon and one for Hydrogen. For the atom with multiple vacan-
cies, we preset the position of each vacancy on its surface, to ensure
that the single bonds (sticks) connected to this atom form a stable
symmetric structure, such as the tetrahedral molecular geometry of
Methane (CH4).

In this paper, we focus on Carbon atoms with single chemical

bonds for illustrative purposes.

3.3 Construction of molecules
To support the tasks outlined above, we designed two gestures and
one additional mode for users to construct molecules.

Pointing gesture The virtual pointer has been widely used in
distant selection in virtual reality, for instance, gaze [28] and ray
emitted from hand-held controllers. In MolecuSense, we follow this
technique and realize it by pointing gesture. When a user makes a
”ﬁnger gun” gesture, the index ﬁnger will emit a ray (Figure 1(a)).
To select a target, the user needs to press the thumb towards the
index ﬁnger. This gesture can be used to click on distant buttons,
whose functions include creating/deleting an atom (T1) or opening
the folder to save/load (T5) a molecule structure. In addition, when
saving a molecular structure, we encoded the position and connection
data of the atoms into an XML ﬁle [7].

Grasping gesture The most natural way to interact with 3D
objects in virtual environments is to use humans hands [29], which
can be supported by force-feedback gloves. In MolecuSense, users
can manipulate a molecule by grasping any atom in the molecule,
including movement and rotation (T3). The atoms and molecules
with electron vacancies can be joined together via drag-and-drop.
When a user holds an atom close to an existing atom or molecule
and reaches a distance threshold, the existing one will ﬂash, as seen
in Figure 1(b). In this case, once the user releases the gesture, the
chemical bond represented by a default-length stick will link these
two structures (T2).

Edit mode When using the pointing gesture to select an atom
in an existing molecule, the edit mode will be activated/deactivated.
In this mode, the selected atom is marked red and frozen in space,
and the angles of all bonds connected to this atom will be presented
(Figure 1(c)). The user can manipulate the other atoms via the
grasping gesture, to changes the length and angles of bonds, which
can even be used to construct ring structures (T4). After releasing
the grasping gesture, all unselected atoms will be slightly adjusted
in position based on a simple molecular force ﬁeld with interatomic
spring forces.

3.4 Implementation

To implement our technical design, the gloves we use needed to
provide force feedback, tactile feedback and hand tracking at the
same time. A pair of SenseGloves, which were inspired by an
exoskeleton, served as a haptic input device in our prototypical
system. The motors on the ﬁngers of the SenseGloves enable it to
simulate the grip of the object and the surface type. In this study we
implemented MolecuSense in a virtual laboratory developed with
Unity 3D, and used a HTC VIVE Pro set, which consists of a HMD,
two base stations, and two 6-DOF trackers on the gloves (Figure 2
(a)).

4 USER STUDY

We designed MolecuSense to combine the advantages of digitization
and tactile interaction in VR. To verify this, we conducted a user
study to compare MolecuSense with existing molecular construction
tools that have only one of the above advantages: a PC-based tool,
which provides digital amenities, and a physical ball-and-stick con-
struction kit. While we did not have available a stylus-based haptic
device [6], studying the differences between different haptic devices
would be similarly interesting and poses fruitful avenues for future
work.

4.1 Study Design & Hypotheses

A total of 18 people at the local university participated in this study,
aged 19-39 years (13 males & 5 females). 12 of them majored in
chemistry, while the others had basic school knowledge of chemistry.
We conducted our study as a within-subject design, with TOOL
(VR, PC, physical model (PHY)) as the sole factor. Based on the
tasks proposed in Section 3.1, we chose TmoleX [10, 24] for the
PC condition and prepared an Orbit molecular model kit [1] for the
PHY condition (Figure 2). Both tools are also based on the ball-and-
stick model. We let the subjects perform a molecule construction
task involving carbon atoms, and measured the workload with a
questionnaire and task completion time, as well as the usability of
different tools.

We formulated two hypotheses for the experiment:
• H1. VR and PHY will cause less workload than PC.
• H2. There is no signiﬁcant difference between VR and PHY

in terms of the system usability.

4.2 Procedure & Task

Participants read the study description, and then completed the
form of consent and a demographic questionnaire. The participants
needed to use different tools to perform the same task. To avoid
order effects, we used a Latin Square to counterbalance the order of
the tools. The task consisted of the following sequence of steps:

1. Create the carbon skeleton of 2-methylbutane.
2. In edit mode, rotate the individual methyl groups in 2-

methylbutane into another conformation.

3. Delete / disassemble the molecule.
4. Load the prefabricated carbon skeleton of cyclopentane.
5. Delete at least one atom of cyclopentane and then use the rest

to create the carbon skeleton of norbornane.

6. Save the molecule (only in VR and PC).

When two atoms are close enough, the unheld one will ﬂash in green, indicating that the current distance can form a bond. (c) When the Edit
mode is activated, the selected atom will be marked in red and ﬁxed in space. Then the users can manipulate the unselected atoms and change
the length and angles of bonds.

After each session, the participants were asked to complete the
NASA Task Load Index (TLX) [13] and the System Usability Scale
(SUS) [5] based on the experience about the current tool. For our VR-
based tool, the participants ﬁlled also a presence questionnaire [27].
And for each tool, we recorded the total time that the participants
spent on completing the task. After all sessions, we conducted a
semi-open interview on subjective preferences and experiences using
the different conditions.

4.3 Results

Performance data were analyzed using One-Way Repeated Measures
ANOVA, with TOOL as the factor. For statistical analyses, we ﬁrst
ran the Shapiro Wilk’s test [22] for normality of dependent variables.
Then we used Greenhous-Geisser corrections [11] to adjust the
lack of sphericity and reported effect sizes with generalized Eta
squared (η 2
G) for ANOVA [4]. For post-hoc tests, we tested the
hypotheses with 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) and visualized them
respectively [9]. For statistical p-values greater than or equal to
0.001, we report their exact values; for the ones less than 0.001 we
report them as “p<.001”.

The TLX score for VR was trending higher than PHY (t=1.31,
p=.20).

4.3.2 System Usability

According to the result of SUS, the system usability was affected
signiﬁcantly by TOOL (F2,34=110.66, p<.001, η 2
G=.794). As seen
in Figure 3 (c), PC had consistently lower SUS scores than VR
(t=11.008, p=<.001) and PHY (t=11.94, p<.001). And the SUS
score for VR was sightly lower than PHY (t=0.66, p=.51).

4.3.3 Presence

We assessed the presence of MolecuSence with the average values of
the presence questionnaire. As shown in Figure 4, we also compared
the subscales of the questionnaire with the standard values provided
by UQO Cyberpsychological Laboratory [3]: (a) Realism, (b) Pos-
sibility to act, (c) Quality of Interface, (d) Possibility to examine,
and (e) Self-evaluation of performance. Although we do not have
the complete dataset for the standard level, it can still roughly be
observed, that MolecuSense had higher scores for all subscales than
standard level.

4.3.1 Completion Time & Workload

4.3.4 Subjective Feedback

As can be seen in Figure 3 (a), there is a signiﬁcantly statistical
main effect of TOOL on completion time (F2,34=67.863, p<.001,
η 2
G=.643). Overall, PHY had a consistently lower completion time
than VR (t=6.61, p<.001) and PC (t=9.08, p<.001). The completion
time for VR was signiﬁcantly lower than PC (t=3.98, p<.001).

The result of TLX questionnaire showed the same situation (Fig-
ure 3 (b)), that the signiﬁcant main effect was found for TOOL
(F2,34=46.718, p<.001, η 2
G=.376). PC had a consistently higher
TLX score than PHY (t=5.343, p<.001) and VR (t=3.99, p<.001).

According to the semi-open interviews, 16 out of 18 participants
preferred VR compared to the other two tools. The remaining two
participants both have professional backgrounds in chemistry. One
of them chose PC and the other preferred PHY, because they used
the corresponding tools frequently in daily work.

5 DISCUSSION

The study results offer preliminary evidence to support our hypothe-
ses H1 and H2.

Figure 3: Overview of the results of user study. (a) Completion time: PHY <VR <PC. (b) TLX: PHY <PC & VR <PC. (c) System Usability:

performing sub-tasks. We found that creating a fair error metric
is non-trivial, especially under the physical-model condition, in
which the participants’ errors could only be subjectively perceived
by themselves.

Although we found initial evidence toward our hypotheses, the
molecule construction task in our experiment were relatively simple
and only involved Carbon atoms. With more types of atoms and
more complex structures involved, the usability and workload of
MolecuSense might change.

7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented MolecuSense, a VR-based molecule
construction tool. This tool combines the advantages of digital
amenities and tactile experience, by allowing users to use force-
feedback gloves to manipulate atoms, build bonds, and eventually
construct molecules, as well as saving and loading molecule struc-
tures. A preliminary study was conducted to compare its workload
and usability with existing tools. The results showed that while this
VR-based molecular construction kit retains some advantages of
digitization, it is closer to the physical models in terms of natural
interaction than PC-based tools. We hope that our work on Mole-
cuSense will inspire other researcher towards using new forms of
interaction for visualization, and by doing so get closer toward the
much needed “science of interaction” for visualization [19].

H1 accepted: Both PHY and VR had lower values than PC in
terms of completion time and TLX scale, which supports that these
tools caused less workload. According to the subjective feedback,
the interactive way of constructing a model by hand felt natural and
intuitive, which evoked less mental and temporal demand.

H2 accepted: We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference between
VR and PHY in terms of SUS. Since we take PHY condition as an
example of tangible molecule construction, and that VR condition
meets the standard levels on most subscales of presence question-
naire, we think this provides evidence that MolecuSense might in-
herit the advantages of tactile feedback from physical models. Note,
that of course with the statistical framework taken, we can never
fully prove such a statement.

6 LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK

This research has limitations regarding prototype and user study.
Many users reported that technical ﬂaws of SenseGlove increased
the difﬁculty of the tasks, although MolecuSense was able to satisfy
the basic needs for preliminary construction. For example, the
ﬁngertips of the virtual hand did not completely correspond to the
real ﬁnger, which took the participants more time to perform the
gestures. In addition, the inaccuracy of force feedback in some
places made the participants miss the best positions, which together
with the cable in the glove limited the ﬁnger movements.

In terms of evaluation, we only measured the holistic completion
time under each condition, so we did not compare the impact of
each tool on different sub-tasks. Future work might also break it
down into the time metrics for individual tasks. Besides, we did not
include other objective metrics, such as the count of errors when
