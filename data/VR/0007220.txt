ABSTRACT

In order to investigate the dynamical status of Seyfert’s Sextet (SS), we have obtained a deep optical
(V R + I) image of this group. Our image shows that a faint envelope, down to a surface brightness
µoptical(AB) ≃ 27 mag arcsec−2, surrounds the member galaxies. This envelope is irregular in shape. It
is likely that this shape is attributed either to recent-past or to on-going galaxy interactions in SS. If
the member galaxies have experienced a number of mutual interactions over a long timescale, the shape
of the envelope should be rounder. Therefore, the irregular-shaped morphology suggests that SS is in
an early phase of dynamical interaction among the member galaxies. It is interesting to note that the
soft X-ray image obtained with ROSAT (Pildis et al. 1995) is signiﬁcantly similar in morphology. We
discuss the possible future evolution of SS brieﬂy.

INTRODUCTION

Since groups of galaxies are intermediate in number den-
sity between isolated galaxies and rich clusters of galaxies,
it is important to investigate their dynamical properties in
detail. Recently, the X-ray satellite ROSAT has been used
to investigate the dark matter content of a large number
of groups of galaxies because the hot gas probed in soft
X-rays is generally believed to be gravitationally bound to
the groups (Ponman & Bertram 1993; Ebeling, Voges, &
B¨ohringer 1994; Pildis, Bregman, & Evrard 1995; Saracco
& Ciliegi 1995; Ponman et al. 1996; Mulchaey & Zablud-
oﬀ 1998). As expected, the majority of groups of galaxies
detected by ROSAT show round-shaped morphologies in
the soft X-ray. On the other hand, a few groups such
as Seyfert’s Sextet (hereafter SS), show irregular-shaped
soft X-ray morphologies (Pildis et al. 1995). The X-ray
morphology can provide important information about the
dynamical status of groups of galaxies. Another useful
method to investigate the dynamical status is to search
for a faint optical envelope surrounding a group of galax-
ies (Nishiura 1998). In this paper, in order to investigate
the dynamical status of SS, we present a very deep optical
image of this group and compare it with the soft X-ray
halo obtained by Pildis et al. (1995).

SS is one of the most famous as well as densest com-
pact group of galaxies (Seyfert 1948a, 1948b). This group
is also a Hickson Compact Group of Galaxies, HCG 79
(Hickson 1982, 1993). The basic data of the galaxies
in SS are listed in Table 1 taken from Hickson (1993).
SS consists of four redshift-accordant galaxies (HCG79a,

HCG79b, HCG79c, and HCG79d). Note that HCG 79e
is a redshift-discordant galaxy which is believed to have
no physical relation to SS. Also, the NE optical fuzz is
now considered to be tidal debris associated with HCG
79b (Rubin, Hunter, & Ford 1991; Williams, McMahon,
& van Gorkom 1991; Mendes de Oliveira & Hickson 1994;
V´ılchez & Iglesias-P´aramo 1998). We assume a distance
to SS of 44h−1 Mpc determined using the mean recession
velocity of HCG 79a, HCG 79b, HCG 79c, and HCG 79d
referenced to the galactic standard of rest, VGSR = 4449
km s−1 (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), and a Hubble con-
stant, H0 = 100 h km s−1 Mpc−1.

2. OBSERVATIONS

2.1. Optical Imaging

Optical V R- and I-band deep images of SS were ob-
tained with the 8192 × 8192 (8K) CCD mosaic camera
(Luppino et al. 1996) attached to the f/10 Cassegrain fo-
cus of the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope at Mauna
Kea Observatory, on 20 May 1999 (V R) and 23 May 1999
(I). The camera provided a ∼ 18′ × 18′ ﬁeld of view. Two-
pixel binning was used yielding a spatial resolution of 0.26
arcsec per element. The integration time for each exposure
was set to 8 minutes. Twenty-three exposures for the V R-
band and 24 exposures for the I-band were taken; thus, the
total integration time amounted to 10,560 seconds in the
V R-band image and 11,520 seconds in the I-band image.
The seeing was ∼0.8 arcsec during the observation.

Data reduction was performed in a standard way us-
ing IRAF1. Flux calibration was made using the data of

band is not a standard photometric band (Jewitt, Luu &
Chen 1996), we adopted an AB magnitude scale for this
bandpass. The photometric errors were estimated to be
±0.05 mag for the V R-band and ±0.03 mag for the I-
band. The limiting surface brightnesses are µlim

2.2. Optical Spectroscopy

In order to investigate the nuclear activity of the mem-
ber galaxies of SS, we have performed optical spectroscopy
during the course of our optical spectroscopy program of
Hickson compact groups of galaxies (Shimada et al. 2000;
Nishiura et al. 2000). Optical spectra were obtained with
the Cassegrain spectrograph attached to the 188 cm tele-
scope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO)
on 22 February (HCG 79a), 15 August (HCG 79b), and 18
August 1996 (HCG 79c and HCG 79d). A 600 lines/mm
grating blazed at 7,500 ˚A was used. The spectral cover-
age was 6,200 ˚A – 6,900 ˚A with a spectral resolution of
2.4 ˚A at 6,500 ˚A. The integration time was 1800 seconds
for each galaxy. The spatial resolution was 1.75 arcsec
pixel−1 and the slit width was 1.8 arcsec. The seeing size
was 2 arcsec during the observations. The data reduction
was made using IRAF with a special package SNGRED for
the OAO spectrograph (Kosugi et al. 1995). Spectroscopic
standard stars (HD 84937, HD 161817, HD 217086, BD
322642, and Feige 15) were observed to calibrate the spec-
tra. One-dimensional nuclear spectra of the four member

galaxies were extracted by tracing the central two pixels;
i.e., 3.5 arcsec. The ﬁnal nuclear spectra are shown in
Figure 4.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. The Morphology of the Faint Optical Envelope

As shown in Figure 1 (a), Figure 2 (a), and Figure 3,
we can see a faint optical envelope surrounding SS both
in the V R image and in the I image. However, since the
member galaxies are very close together on the sky, we
cannot rule out a possibility that we may misidentify the
overlapping isophotes of galaxies for the real faint optical
envelope.
In order to conﬁrm the presence of the faint
optical envelope, it is necessary to subtract oﬀ models of
all the galaxies in SS. For this purpose we have made a
model of each galaxy in SS by ﬁtting a surface brightness
proﬁle of its outer region. In this procedure, we adopt a de
Vaucouleurs’ r1/4 law for HCG 79a and 79c and an expo-
nential law for HCG 79b, 79d, 79e. We also made a model
for the tidal debris east of HCG 79b (see Fig. 3) with
an exponential law. Surface photometry was carried out
using the Surface Photometry Interactive Reduction and
Analysis Library (Hamabe & Ichikawa 1992). We made an
image of the model SS by adding the above models. In this

procedure we use the ARTDATA package with the ﬁtting
parameters derived by the surface photometry. In Table
2 we list the parameters of our model galaxies. For the
model of the tidal debris east of HCG 79b, it seems that
there is a much better ﬁt would be found with a rounder
model at a larger position angle. Fainter parts of the de-
bris may be connected to the optical envelope. Therefore,
we have made our model ﬁt for the brighter part of the
debris and then subtracted it from the image.

The results are shown in Figure 1 (b) (VR-band) and 2

Figure 1 (c) (VR-band) and 2 (c) (I-band). Figure 5 and 6
show the VR- and I-band surface brightness proﬁles of all

proﬁles and solid lines indicate the proﬁles of the model

see the faint optical envelope surrounding SS both in the
V R image and in the I image.

Next, in order to check whether the skirts of the point
spread function (PSF) of the galactic nuclei contaminate
the faint optical envelope, we compared the surface bright-
ness proﬁles of all the galaxies in SS with that of a star
in the same frame of SS. The surface brightness proﬁle of
the star is shown as dotted lines in Figure 5 and 6. We

cannot ﬁnd any contribution of the light of the PSF to
the faint optical envelope surrounding SS both in the V R
image and in the I image. Throughout these two checks
we have conﬁrmed that the faint optical envelope is really
present around SS.

Using the images in Figure 1c and Figure 2c, we roughly
calculate the VR and I magnitudes of the faint optical en-
velope by integrating the light without any point sources
(i.e., stars in our Galaxy) within a circle of the centered
at α = 15h56m59.s6, and δ = +20d54m59.s6 with a radius
of 70 arcsec enclosing the optical faint envelope of SS. The
regions which appear black on Figure 1c and 2c are also
ignored. We obtain V RAB ≃ 14.5 and I ≃ 13.7 for the
envelope. The luminosity contribution of the envelope to
the total luminosity is ≈ 12 % in VR and ≈ 13 % in I.
This implies that the envelope consists of red stars. If we
assume that the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar compo-
nent of the optical faint envelope is M/L = 3.57 ± 0.43
(M⊙/L⊙) in I-band (Worthey 1994), we obtain the mass
of the optical faint envelope, Menv ≃ (9.1 ± 1.1) × 109M⊙.
The morphology of the faint optical envelope in the V R
image is quite similar to that in the I image. The overall
morphology of the individual galaxies is consistent with
that obtained previously (Sulentic & Lorre 1983). The
faint optical envelope shows an irregular shape. It is likely
that this shape is attributed either to recent-past or to
on-going galaxy interactions in SS. If the member galaxies
have experienced a number of mutual interaction over a
long timescale, the shape of the envelope might reason-
ably be expected to be rounder. Therefore, the irregular-
shaped morphology suggests that SS is in an early phase
of dynamical interactions among the member galaxies.

Rubin et al. (1991) and Nishiura et al. (2000) showed
that the optical rotation curve of HCG 79d is peculiar com-
pared to those of normal spirals. Williams et al. (1991)
obtained an H i map of SS and found that the H i emission,
whose intensity peak appears at the center of HCG 79d,
shows a southern extension from HCG 79d. They inter-
preted this as possible evidence for the interaction between
HCG 79d and 79b. It is thus strongly suggested that HCG
79d shows tidal eﬀects from this interaction.

Fig. 7.— The soft X-ray image (black contours) taken from Pildis
et al. (1995) is overlaid on our (V R + I) CCD image. The Soft X-
ray contours are drawn at 1σ, 2σ, 4σ, and 8σ above the background
level.

Finally, we compare our very deep optical image [V R+I;
Figure 3] with the soft X-ray image taken by Pildis et al.
(1995) in Figure 7. It is shown that the soft X-ray mor-
phology is quite similar to that seen in the optical. The op-
tical faint envelope is most likely attributed to stars liber-
ated from the member galaxies through past and on-going
tidal interactions. Therefore, the morphological similar-
ity between the optical and soft X-ray images implies that
the dark matter in SS was originally associated with the
individual galaxies and then has been liberated tidally to-
gether with the stars.

3.2. The Origin of Soft-X Ray Emission

The total soft X-ray luminosity of SS is given only as an
upper limit, LX,tot < 1.3 × 1041h−2 ergs s−1 with ROSAT
PSPC (Ponman et al. 1996; hereafter P96). On the other
hand, using the same data, Pildis et al. (1995) detected
soft X-ray photons at the 2.6σ level. The net count of
the extended soft X-ray emission was 28.4±11.1 during
the total integration time of 4910 sec. Using the software
Xspec2, we estimate the soft X-ray luminosity of the ex-
tended emission; LX ∼ 1.3 × 1040h−2 ergs s−1 for kT = 0.5
keV or LX ∼ 1.4 × 1040h−2 ergs s−1 for kT = 1 keV, where
the metal abundances are assumed to be 0.3 times solar. It
is diﬃcult to resolve X-ray emission from individual galax-
ies using the ROSAT PSPC because of the compactness
of SS itself, even if the exposure time were long enough.
It is possible that a part of the X-ray emission may be
associated with individual member galaxies. Here we also
attempt to examine whether or not the soft X-ray emission
of SS really arises from hot gas since supernova remnants,
low- and high-mass X-ray binaries, and/or active galactic
nuclei could also contribute substantially to the soft X-ray
emission to some extent if they are present in the member
galaxies.

First we estimate the expected soft X-ray luminosities
of discrete sources such as X-ray binaries in the individual
galaxies LX,gal. Such soft X-ray luminosities can be esti-
mated using the following empirical LX - LB relationship
for galaxies where LB is the absolute blue luminosity.
log LX = (2.47 ± 1.01) × log LB − (68.36 ± 44.08),

for early-type galaxies (Brown & Bregman 1998), and

log LX = (1.21 ± 0.03) × log LB − (13.29 ± 1.39).

2Xspec is available at http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/webspec/webspec.html

for late-type galaxies (Read, Ponman, & Strickland 1997;
Vogler, Pietish, & Kahabka 1996). In Table 1, we give a
summary of the expected soft X-ray luminosities for the
individual galaxies where LB is estimated using the appar-
ent blue magnitudes (Hickson 1993). Although HCG 79e is
the redshift-discordant galaxy, this galaxy also contributes
to the observed soft X-ray luminosity of SS because it lies
in a line of sight toward the group. We obtain an expected
total soft X-ray luminosity coming from individual soft X-
ray sources in the ﬁve galaxies; LX,gal ≃ 4.4×1039h−2 ergs
s−1, which is much lower than the observed soft X-ray lu-
minosity of SS.

Second, we estimate possible contributions of soft X-
ray emission from starburst phenomena in the member
galaxies, LX,Hii. The spectroscopic properties of the mem-
ber galaxies based on our optical spectra (Figure 4) are
summarized in Table 3. Our results show that HCG
79a, 79b and 79d have a weak Hii nucleus. HCG 79c
shows no emission-line activity. For starburst galaxies,
an average soft X-ray to optical B luminosity ratio is
log LX/LB ≃ −3.87 ± 0.19 (Read et al.
estimated as,
1997). We estimate that the soft X-ray luminosities from
an H II nucleus in HCG 79a, 79b and 79d are LX,Hii =
2.8 × 1039h−2, 4.8 × 1039h−2, and 7.1 × 1038h−2 ergs s−1,
respectively. Thus, we obtain a total soft X-ray luminosity
from starbursts in these galaxies, LX,Hii = 8.3 × 1039h−2
ergs s−1

The model estimated total soft X-ray luminosity from
SS, which is the sum total we have calculated above for
the soft X-ray luminosity of the individual galaxies, is
1.3 × 1040 ergs s−1. This value is nearly identical to our es-
timated value using Xspec, LX,tot = 1.3 × 1040h−2ergs s−1
with kT =0.5keV and Z=0.3 Z⊙ assumed, and LX,tot =
1.4 × 1040h−2ergs s−1 with kT =1.0keV and Z=0.3 Z⊙ as-
sumed.

Finally, we estimate the X-ray luminosity of hot gas
trapped by the gravitational potential of SS, LX,gas.
Mulchaey & Zabludoﬀ (1998) ﬁnd a correlation between
soft X-ray luminosity from hot gas within poor clusters
LX,gas and radial velocity dispersion σr of galaxies in them,

log LX = (31.61 ± 1.09) + log h−2 + (4.29 ± 0.37) × log σr.

Using this empirical relation, we obtain LX,gas = 6.2 ×
1040h−2 ergs s−1 using the observed value σr = 138 km
s−1 for SS. This value is a factor of ﬁve larger than the ob-
served X-ray luminosity. Since the sum total we calculate
for the soft X-ray luminosity of the individual galaxies is
high enough to explain the observed X-ray luminosity, it
is not necessarily to take account of the mass contribution
from the hot gas. Deeper X-ray observations of SS are
needed to discuss the nature of the hot gas in SS.

3.3. The Dynamical Properties of Seyfert’s Sextet

To discuss the dynamical properties of SS, we ﬁrst esti-
mate the dynamical mass of the system. Heisler, Tremaine
& Bahcall (1985) have proposed four mass estimators for
small-member galaxy associations such as compact groups
of galaxies; 1) the virial mass estimator Mvir, 2) the pro-
jected mass estimator Mproj, 3) the average mass estimator
Mavg, and 4) the median mass estimator Mmed. In order
to avoid accidental errors in each mass estimator, we es-
timate the total mass of SS by averaging masses derived

from these four estimators; Mtot ≃ 3.6 × 1011h−1M⊙. The
results are summarized in Table 4.

a Hickson et al.

(1992) obtained a virial mass of SS,
Mvir = 1.38 × 1011M⊙, using Mvir ≃ πV 2R/2G, where V
is the estimated intrinsic three-demensional velocity disper-
sion, V = [3(< v2 > − < v >2)− < δv2 >]1/2, v is
the measured radial velocity of the galaxy, δv is the esti-
mated velocity error, and <> denotes the average over all
galaxies in the group, R is the median length of the two-
dimensional galaxy-galaxy separation, G is the gravitational
constant. In this study we estimated the virial mass of SS us-
ing the virial mass estimator taken from Heisler et al. (1985),
(vi− < v >)2/2G Pi<j
Mvir = [3πN Pi
(1/Rij )], where N
is the number of member galaxies, vi is the radial velocity of
the i-th galaxy, Rij is the two-dimensional distance between
the i-th galaxy and the j-th galaxy.

Next, we estimate the mass including dark matter asso-
ciated with the member galaxies of SS, Mgal. The mean
mass-to-luminosity ratios for each Hubble type are as fol-
lows: 13.7 ± 0.3 for early-type galaxies (Bacon, Monnet,
& Simien 1985), and 9.1 ± 4.0 for Sdm galaxies, where
we have estimated a typical mass-to-luminosity ratio for
Sdm galaxies by averaging that of Sc galaxies, 5.2 ± 0.4
(Rubin et al. 1985), and that of irregular galaxies, 12.9 ±
7.5 (Lo, Sargent & Young 1993). Although HCG 79a and
79b are LINERs, the line emission has little eﬀect on their
B-band luminosities because the equivalent widths of Hα
emission, EW (Hα), of these galaxies are less than several
˚A (see Table 3). HCG 79d has a much larger EW (Hα).
However, its contribution to the total B-band luminosity
of SS is only a few percent. Therefore, the B luminosity
derived above can be regarded as the stellar B luminosity.
We thus obtain an estimate of the total (i.e., stars, gas,
and the dark matter) mass of the individual galaxies of SS,
Mgal ≃ 2.7 × 1011h−1M⊙; note that Mgal does not con-
tain the mass of dark matter in intragroup space. Since
this mass is 73±3 % of the estimated dynamical mass of
SS, it would appear that the majority of the dark matter
may still be associated with the member galaxies. Since
the dynamical mass measures the mass inside the circle
enclosing the galaxies and is therefore insensitive to any
mass outside it, we note that the ratio of 73% is an upper
limit.

3.4. Dynamical Evolution of Seyfert’s Sextet

We discuss the possible future evolution of SS. The
irregular-shaped soft X-ray morphology of SS suggests that

the dark matter in SS has not yet completely relaxed dy-
namically. This appears consistent with the following ob-
servations: 1) the member galaxies in SS show morpholog-
ical and kinematic evidence for violent interactions, and 2)
the majority of the dynamical mass of SS can be associated
with the member galaxies. It is thus strongly suggested
that SS is a dynamically-young, compact group of galax-
ies which will eventually merge. It has been numerically
shown that the merging time scale of a compact group of
galaxies, each member of which has a dark halo, is much
shorter (i.e., ∼ 109 yr) than the Hubble time (Athanas-
soula, Makino, & Bosma 1998). Therefore, it is expected
that SS will most likely merge into a single object within
a time scale less than 109 years and ﬁnally evolve into an
elliptical galaxy with a large, virialized halo. Such a fossil
group of galaxies has been reported; a soft X-ray source
RXJ 1340.6+4018 turns out to be an elliptical galaxy with
a large-scale (∼ 250 h−1 kpc) X-ray halo (Ponman et al.
1994; Jones et al. 2000). Other candidates may be the
elliptical galaxy NGC 4636 in the Virgo cluster of galaxies
(Matsushita et al. 1998) and an isolated elliptical galaxy
NGC 1132 (Mulchaey & Zabludoﬀ 1999).

Fig. 8.— The relationship between the mass-to-optical B-band
luminosity ratio and the size from Bahcall et al. (1995). The solid
line and dashed line indicate the best ﬁt lines for ellipticals and for
spirals, respectively. The ﬁlled circle indicates SS. The open circle
means NGC 1132. The ﬁlled square means NGC 4636. The cross
indicates RXJ 1340.6+4018.

Finally, we investigate the relationship between the
mass-to-light ratio (Mtot/LB where LB is the absolute
B luminosity) and the radius (R) of SS and compare it
with those of the candidate fossil groups and typical el-
liptical galaxies studied by Bahcall et al.
(1995). The
basic properties of the ellipticals with large-scale X-ray
halos are listed in Table 5 taken from Ponman et al.
(1994), Matsushita et al. (1998), and Mulchaey & Zablud-
oﬀ (1999). Summing the blue luminosities of the four
member galaxies, we obtain a total blue luminosity for SS,
LB,tot ≃ 2.0 × 1010h−2L⊙. We thus obtain a mass-to-light
ratio for SS, M/LB ≃ 18hM⊙/L⊙. The linear size of SS is
R ≃ 8h−1 kpc which is the radius of a circle including the
center of the four member galaxies. We also show these
quantities in Table 5.

It seems worthwhile noting that the relationship be-
tween M/LB and R for SS follows well that for elliptical
galaxies (Bahcall et al. 1995: see Figure 4). We therefore
suspect that the eventual merger remnant of SS may likely
evolve into an ordinary elliptical galaxy.
