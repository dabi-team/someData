Abstract—Virtual Reality (VR) and its applications have at-
tracted signiﬁcant and increasing attention. However, the re-
quirements of much larger ﬁle sizes, different storage formats,
and immersive viewing conditions pose signiﬁcant challenges to
the goals of acquiring, transmitting, compressing and displaying
high quality VR content. Towards meeting these challenges, it is
important to be able to understand the distortions that arise and
that can affect the perceived quality of displayed VR content. It
is also important to develop ways to automatically predict VR
picture quality. Meeting these challenges requires basic tools in
the form of large, representative subjective VR quality databases
on which VR quality models can be developed and which can be
used to benchmark VR quality prediction algorithms. Towards
making progress in this direction, here we present the results
of an immersive 3D subjective image quality assessment study.
In the study, 450 distorted images obtained from 15 pristine 3D
VR images modiﬁed by 6 types of distortion of varying severities
were evaluated by 42 subjects in a controlled VR setting. Both
the subject ratings as well as eye tracking data were recorded
and made available as part of the new database, in hopes that
the relationships between gaze direction and perceived quality
might be better understood. We also evaluated several publicly
available IQA models on the new database, and also report a
statistical evaluation of the performances of the compared IQA
models.

I. INTRODUCTION

V IRTUAL Reality (VR) and its applications have evolved

quickly in recent years since the launches of popular
head-mounted consumer displays like the Oculus Rift, HTC
Vive and PlayStation VR. Revenues from VR apps, gaming
and video reached nearly 4 billion dollars in 2017 and are
expected to soar more than ﬁvefold by 2022 [1]. Given the
recent availability of cheaper standalone headsets, like the
Oculus Go, and the development of faster and more reliable 5G
wireless networks, the installed base of headsets is expected
to grow substantially. VR is being used in an increasing va-
riety of consumer applications, including gaming, 360-degree
image and video viewing, and visually immersive education.
Websites like Youtube, Facebook and Netﬂix now support 360
image and video viewing and are offering a variety of online
resources, further stimulating more consumer participation in
VR.

Unlike traditional images, VR images are usually captured
using a 360 camera equipped with multiple lenses that capture
the entire 360 degrees of a scene. For example, the Samsung
Gear 360 VR Camera is a portable consumer VR device with
180° dual lenses that can capture images of resolution up to

5472 × 2736. The recent Insta360 Titan is a professional
360 camera with eight 200° ﬁsheye lenses that can capture
both 2D and 3D images of resolution up to 11K. After
the images are captured simultaneously by separate lenses,
they are stitched together to generate a spherical image. The
spherical image is usually stored in equirectangular projection
format. Stereoscopic images are usually stored in an over-
image is on
under equirectangular format, where the left
top and the right one is on the bottom. Unlike traditional
viewing conditions where people watch images and videos
on ﬂat-panel computer and mobile displays, VR offers a
more immersive viewing environment. Since the image can
cover the entire viewing space, users are free to view the
image in every direction. Usually, only a small portion of the
image is displayed as they gaze in any given direction, so
the content that a user sees is highly dependent on the spatial
distribution of image content, the object being ﬁxated on, and
the spatial distribution of visual attention. The free-viewing
of high resolution,
immersive VR implies signiﬁcant data
volume, which leads to challenges when storing, transmitting
and rendering the images which can affect the viewing quality.
Therefore, it is important to be able to analyze and predict the
perceptual quality of immersive VR image.

Both subjective and objective tools are needed to understand
and assess immersive VR images quality. Subjective VR image
quality assessment (VR-IQA) is a process whereby the quality
of VR images is rated by human subjects. The collected
opinion scores supply the gold standard ground truth on
which predictive models can be designed or tested. To our
knowledge, there are only a few existing VR databases that
include subjective measurements. Most only include traditional
distortions such as image compression artifacts, Gaussian
noise and Gaussian blur, but fail to capture distortions that
are unique to panoramic VR (2D and 3D) images. Towards
advancing progress in this direction, we have created a more
comprehensive database that both includes traditional image
distortions as well as VR-speciﬁc stitching distortions. We
also include eye tracking data that was obtained during the
subjective study. The new LIVE 3D VR IQA Database will be
made publicly available for free to facilitate the development
of 2D and 3D VR IQA models by other research groups. The
database can be accessed at http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/
VR3D/index.html.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
brieﬂy introduces current progress on objective and subjective
VR-IQA research. Section III describes the details of the
subjective study. Section IV discusses data analysis of the
subjective study results. Section V analyzes the performances
of a variety of objective IQA models on the new database,
and Section VI concludes the paper with some discussion of
future research directions.

II. RELATED WORKS

B. Objective Quality Assessment

A. Subjective Quality Assessment

Although it dates from at least as early as the 1970’s,
VR has been a topic of considerably renewed interest since
the appearance of the Oculus Rift DK1. Viewing images in
VR gives a more realistic and immersive viewing experience
arising from the large ﬁeld of view, 360° free navigation and
the sense of being within a virtual environment.

However, the immersive environment incurs a signiﬁcant
computational cost. VR images and videos are much larger
than traditional planar images displayed on computer or TV
screens and require much higher transmission bandwidth and
signiﬁcantly greater computational power. These demands
are hard to meet, often at
the cost of errors in capture,
transmission, coding, processing, synthesis, and display. These
errors often degrade the visual quality by introducing blur,
blocking, transmission, or stitching artifacts. Therefore, de-
veloping algorithms for the automated quality assessment of
VR images will help enable the future development of VR
technology. Developing these algorithms requires subjective
data for design, testing, and benchmarking. There are many
widely used image quality databases, such as the LIVE Image
Quality Assessment Database [2], the TID2013 database [3],
CSIQ [4], and the LIVE In-the-Wild Challenge Database [5].
These databases embody a wide variety of image distortions,
but they were built for the purpose of studying traditional
"framed" 2D images and are not suitable for building or testing
algorithms designed to assess VR images.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in developing
VR databases, and progress has been made in this direction.
Duan et al. [6] developed an immersive video database, con-
taining downsampling and MPEG-4 compression distortions.
In [7], Upenik et al. introduced a mobile testbed for evalu-
ating immersive images and videos and an immersive image
database with JPEG compression. Sun et al. [8] constructed
the Compression VR Image Quality Database (CVIQD),
which consists of 5 reference images and corresponding
compressed images created using three coding technologies:
JPEG, H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC. An omnidirectional IQA
(OIQA) database established by Duan et al. [9] includes four
distortion types, JPEG compression, JPEG2000 compression,
Gaussian blur and Gaussian noise. This database also includes
head and eye tracking data that compliment the objective
ratings. Another database that both includes head and eye
movement data, VQA-OV, was proposed in [10]. This database
includes impairments from both compression and map projec-
tion. Xu et al. [11] also established a database with viewing
direction data on immersive videos. However, most of the
available VR databases only include distortions that occur in
planar images, but without distortions that are speciﬁc to VR,
such as stitching. Moreover, newer compression methods such
as VP9 are relevant to the encoding of VR images, and these
other compression methods are likely to play a substantive
role in the future. Furthermore, amongst all the existing VR
databases, to the best of our knowledge there are no 3D VR
image quality databases as of yet.

Both MSE and PSNR were long used as the basic way
to assess image and video quality prior to the appearance of
modern image objective quality assessment (IQA) methods.
These IQA methods can be classiﬁed as: full reference (FR-
IQA), reduced reference (RR-IQA) , or no reference (NR-
IQA). Full reference IQA is appropriate when an undistorted,
pristine reference image is available. Reduced reference IQA
models only require partial reference information, and no
reference IQA algorithms operate without any reference image
information at all.

Popular modern FR picture quality models include the
Structural Similarity (SSIM) [12], its multiscale form, MS-
SSIM [13], Visually Information Fidelity (VIF) [14], FSIM
[15], GMSD [16], VSI [17] and MDSI [18]. NR-IQA models
have also been proposed, including BRISQUE [19], NIQE
[20], BLIINDS [21], and CORNIA [22].

Several VR-speciﬁc IQA models have also been proposed
over the years. Yu et al. [23] proposed a spherical PSNR
model called S-PSNR, which averages quality over all viewing
directions. The authors of [24] introduced a craster parabolic
projection based PSNR (CPP-PSNR) VR-IQA model. Xu et
al. [25] proposed two kinds of perceptual VQA (P-VQA)
methods: a non-content-based PSNR (NCP-PSNR) algorithm
and a content-based PSNR (CP-PSNR) method. WS-PSNR
[26] is yet another PSNR based VR-IQA method, which
reweights pixels according to their location in space. SSIM
has also been extended in a similar manner, as exempliﬁed by
S-SSIM [27]. Yang et al. [28] proposed a content-aware algo-
rithm designed speciﬁcally to assess stitched VR images, by
combining a geometric error metric with a locally-constructed
guided IQA method. A NR-IQA method designed to assess
stitched panoramic images using convolutional sparse coding
and compound feature selection was proposed in [29]. Given
the explosive popularity of deep learning, many more recent
VR-IQA methods have been learned to analyze immersive
images and videos, often achieving impressive results. For
example,
the authors deployed an end-to-end 3D
convolutional neural network to predict the quality of VR
the power of
videos without reference. In [31] and [32],
adversarial learning was utilized to successfully predict the
quality of images.

III. DETAILS OF THE SUBJECTIVE STUDY

A. Image Capture

We used an Insta360 Pro camera [33] to capture the VR
image in our 360 image database, due to its portability,
raw format availability, high resolution (7680 × 3840), and
good image quality. Instead of only capturing colorful, highly
saturated images, we collected a wide variety of natural scenes,
including daytime/night scenes, sunny/cloudy backgrounds,
indoor/outdoor scenes, and so on. We acquired 15 high-quality
immersive 3D 360° reference images containing diverse con-
tent. Most of the scenes were captured in Austin, Texas. For
each scene, 4 to 5 raw images (.dng format) were captured
to ensure that one with the least amount of motion blur and
stitching error could be selected. For each scene, an over-

under equirectangular 3D image was generated. We selected
the images to span a wide range of spatial information and
colorfulness, as shown in Figure 1. Spatial Information (SI)
is a measure that indicates the amount of spatial detail of
a picture, and it is usually higher for more spatially complex
scenes [34]. Color information is computed using Colorfulness
(CF) as proposed in [35] which represents intensity and variety
of colors in an image. Higher values indicate more colorful
images. Figure 1(c) depicts a scatter plot of SI vs. CF, showing
that our database includes a variety of images considering both
metrics. Examples of images in our database are shown in
Figure 2.

B. Test Images

Each of the selected 15 reference VR content was subjected
to 6 types of distortion, including Gaussian noise, Gaussian
blur, stitching distortion, downsampling distortion, VP9 com-
pression, and H.265 compression. The driving goal of our
study was to create a diverse and representative immersive
stereoscopic 3D image quality database for developing, testing,
and benchmarking VR-related IQA methods. We included
the traditional distortions as well as VR-speciﬁc stitching
distortions. We also included recent compression distortions,
including VP9 and H.265, to study and model the way they
compress and perceptually distort VR images.

The distortion levels were determined to ensure noticeable
perceptual separation between severity levels while also avoid-
ing obvious differences between neighboring levels. All of
the distortions other than stitching distortions were applied
directly to the equirectangular 3D image. The 360 images
were generated using Insta360 Stitcher. Since the resolution
images was 7680 × 3840, we scaled the
of the original
reference images to resolution 4096 × 2048 to match the
resolution of the VR headset used in the study (as well as
most commercial models) before applying the distortions. In
the following sections, we explain the way each of the different
distortions were applied to the 15 reference 3D VR images.

1) Gaussian Noise

Gaussian additive noise was applied to the unit normalized
RGB channels with standard deviations in the range [0.002,
0.03].

2) Gaussian Blur

We separated the left and right

images and applied a
circular-symmetric 2-D Gaussain kernel to the RGB channels
using standard deviations in the range of [0.7, 3.1] pixels. Each
RGB channel in both the left and right image was blurred with
the same kernel.

3) Downsampling

The left and right images were separated before adding
downsampling distortion. Each original immersive image was
downsampled to one of ﬁve reduced spatial resolutions using
bicubic interpolation. We used the HTC Vive for our subjective
experiments. This HMD presents a resolution of 1080×1200
and Field of View (FOV) of 110 degrees to each eye. The
preferred resolution between 3K and 4K can be found by
calculating the portion of solid angle that the FOV spans. We

3

set the maximum total resolution to be 4096×2048, as also
suggested in [36], [37], and the minimum resolution to be
820×820, thereby covering a wide range of qualities.

4) Stitching Distortion

We ﬁrst separated the left and right images and captured 14
perspective views from each image using MATLAB, covering
the entire spherical image to simulate a 14-head panoramic
camera placed at the center of each scene [28]. The viewing
directions we used are listed in Table I, where φ represents
the zenith angle, and θ represents the azimuth angle. The FOV
was set to 110 degrees. An example of the 14 views is shown
in Figure 4.

After obtaining a set of images captured by the virtual
lenses, we imported the views into the popular stitching tool
Nuke, and adjusted the orientation of each stitched image to
have the same orientation as its reference image, to avoid
introducing any further discomfort. Speciﬁcally, since the ﬁrst
viewing direction points to the zenith, we adjusted the ZXY
rotation parameters in Nuke such that the ﬁrst perspective view
(generated by the ﬁrst viewing direction) was on the right
position. This was done by searching the rotation matrix space
to ﬁnd the parameters that would rotate the ﬁrst view back to
the zenith.

to generate different

After adjusting the orientation of the stitched image, we
tuned the stitching parameters, mainly the convergence dis-
tance, error threshold and whether ‘reﬁne’ or ‘reject’ was
levels of the distortion. An
applied,
example of different levels of stitching distortion is shown in
Figure 5. The same procedure was applied on the left and right
images, and we ensured that the stitching distortion created
was at the same location in the two images to avoid further
discomfort arising from binocular rivalry.

5) VP9 Compression

VP9 compression was applied using the popular public
domain software FFmpeg, using the libvpx-vp9 encoder. We
varied the constant quality factor over the range [50, 63],
where lower values indicate better quality.

6) H.265 Compression

H.265 (HEVC) compression distortion was applied using
the FFmpeg libx265 encoder with different QP values ranging
from 38 to 50, where higher values imply increased compres-
sion and worse quality.

C. Subjective Testing Design

We employed the Single Stimulus Continuous Quality eval-
uation methods described in the ITU-R BT 500.13 recom-
mendation [38]. The human subjects entered their quality
adjustments on a continuous rating scale from 0 to 100, where
0 indicates worst quality.

Each viewing session was limited to a duration of 30
minutes and the subjects were free to take rests at any time.
The subjects were asked whether they were prone to discom-
fort when participating in either a VR or 3D environment
beforehand, to eliminate subjects who were not suitable for
this subjective study. The visual acuity of each subject was
determined using the Snellen test, and each subject was asked

to wear their corrective lenses to achieve normal vision when
participating in the study. Each subject also participated in a
RanDot Stereo test of their stereo vision and depth perception.
If any test showed impairment, the subject was recommended
not to take this test, but if the subject decided to perform the
test, the results were discarded. The range of Interpupillary
Distances (IPD) of the HTC Vive is 60.3mm-73.7mm. For
those subjects whose IPD was outside of this range, a period
of experimentation with the HMD was allowed. If the subject
felt uncomfortable, then it was recommended that he/she not

Detailed procedures of the subjective test are described in the
following sections.

1) Eye tracking

Eye tracking commenced at the beginning of each session.
Subjects ﬁxated on ﬁve red dots that ﬂashed sequentially in
the HMD at different positions [39], as shown in Figure 7.
These points are mapped in normalized coordinates so that
(0.0, 0.0) corresponds to the upper left corner and (1.0, 1.0)
corresponds to the lower right corner of the current viewport.
Each subject was asked to stare at each dot in succession, then
after the last dot disappeared, the system used the recorded dot
ﬁxations to calibrate the eyetracker. The process was repeated
if the calibration was not successful. If the calibration was
still not successful after ﬁve trials, the subject would be asked
to participate at another time. This situation happened twice
during our experiments.

2) Viewing and Scoring

The quality scale popped up automatically after 20 seconds
of viewing to limit each subject’s time viewing the images. To
avoid having the subject view the image after the time limit,
a grey canvas displayed as background of the rating bar, as
shown in Figure 8. The quality scale was in the center of the
subject’s ﬁeld of view, wherever they moved their head. Five
Likert labels “Bad, Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent" indicated the
range of ratings the subject could apply. To rate the images,
the subjects used the hand controllers supplied with the VR
headset to choose the desired score on the quality scale. After
the subject was satisﬁed with the score chosen, they clicked
on ’Submit and Next’ to see the next image. Once the subject
submitted the score, the name and score of the image were
written to ﬁle. The submission timestamp was also recorded to
determine the correspondences between the gaze data and the
image. The subsequent image was randomly chosen from all
the images in the session, subject to the previously mentioned
constraints on the display order. Detailed gaze data was output
by the Tobii Pro at the end of each session.

E. Subjects and Training

All subjects were students at The University of Texas at
Austin. The subject pool was inexperienced with image quality
assessment and image distortions. A total of 40 students were
involved in the study, and each image was rated by around 15
students.

Each subject was orally briefed about the goals of the study
and presented with the detailed procedure in written form. A
consent form was also signed by the subject. Each subject was
asked to view the image as much as possible and score the
images according to image quality only, without regard to the
appeal of the content. Before the actual session, each subject
viewed a training session of 10 images not included in the

Fig. 4. Example of 14 perspective views that were stitched together

perform the test. The data was also discarded when the subject
did not follow instructions.

Each subject participated in three sessions separated by
at least 24 hours apart. For each session, 9 contents and
60 distorted images were randomly selected. The "hidden"
reference image was included in each session. To reduce the
effects of memory comparisons, images of the same content
were separated by at least ﬁve images of different content.
The average viewing time for each session was 27 minutes,
with the average viewing and rating time for each image being
around 23 seconds.

D. Subjective Test Display

The subjective test was displayed on a HTC Vive VR
headset with a built-in Tobii Pro eye tracking system [39],
as depicted in Figure 6. The Tobii Pro Eye tracking is fully
integrated into the HTC Vive HMD. It
trackes the gaze
direction using the Pupil Center Corneal Reﬂection technique.
More speciﬁcally, it uses dark pupil eye tracking, where an
illuminator is placed away from the optical axis causing the
pupil to appear darker than the iris. Tobii Pro eye tracking has
an accuracy of 0.5°, a latency of approximately 10ms, and a
sampling frequency of 120 Hz. There are several data outputs
for each eye: device and system timestamp, gaze origin,
gaze direction, pupil position and absolute pupil size. Image
playback was supported by a dedicated high performance
server (Intel i7-6700, 32GB memory, 1TB hard drive, NVIDIA
TITAN X). The interface was built using Unity Game Engine.

IV. DATA ANALYSIS

Subjective Difference Mean Opinion Score (DMOS) were
computed according to [40].The difference scores for reference
images were 0 and were discarded for all sessions. Then per
session Z-scores were computed from the difference scores
and combined into a score matrix zij and a "viewed" matrix
sij, where 0 indicates the image was not seen by the subject
and 1 indicates the image was seen by the subject.

Subject rejection was performed using the ITU-R BT 500.11
[38] to discard unreliable subjects. To proceed with subject
rejection, we ﬁrst determined whether the scores assigned
by a subject were normally distributed, using the β2 test by
calculating the kurtosis coefﬁcient of the function:

and

database. These images were distorted in the same way as the
images in the database and spanned the same ranges of quality,
to give the subject an idea of the quality and distortions that
would be seen in the actual sessions. The subjects rated these
images accordingly using the same technique as in the actual
session to familiarize themselves with the controllers and the
VR headset.

If β2 fell between 2 and 4, the scores were assumed to be
normally distributed. Then:

if zj ≥ ¯zj + 2σj, then Pi = Pi + 1
if zj ≤ ¯zj − 2σj, then Qi = Qi + 1
If the scores were deemed to not be normally distributed,

then:

if zj ≥ ¯zj +
if zj ≤ ¯zj −

If Equation 1 and Equation 2 were both found to hold, then a
subject was rejected.

In our study, 2 out of 42 subjects were rejected. For the
remaining subjects, we mapped their Z-score to [0, 100] using
equation mentioned in [40]. Finally, the DMOS of each image
was obtained by computing the mean of the rescaled Z-scores
from 40 remaining subjects. A histogram of the recorded
DMOS and a plot of the correlations between each subject’s
ratings and DMOS are shown in Figure 9. The DMOS were
found to lie in the range [24.67, 76.99].

To explore the internal consistency of the subject data, we
randomly divided the subjects into two equal size groups,
and computed the Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefﬁcient
(SROCC) correlation between their scores. This was done
1000 times. After 1000 splits, the range of correlations was
found to be between 0.80 and 0.90 with a median value
of 0.87. Hence,
there was a high degree of inter-subject
agreement despite the more complex immersive viewing envi-
ronment. We also calculated correlations by distortion category
as shown in Table II. Clearly, stitching distortion resulted in
the lowest inter-subject correlation, which is not unexpected,
since stitching distortions are highly localized distortions and
their ratings are dependent on the amount of visual attention
they received from each subject.

Figure 10 plots the DMOS across all contents, where
each color coded curve corresponds to a different distortion
level. As shown in the ﬁgure, for downsampling and H.265
compression distortions, the DMOS associated with most of
the contents decreased with distortion level and the DMOS for
different distortion levels are clearly separated. Interestingly,
for Gaussian noise and VP9 distortions, the DMOS given
to some of the contents were not always monotonic with
distortion level. For stitching distortions, the DMOS across
distortion levels were mostly consistent but slighly entangled.
Figure 11 plots the DMOS ranges against distortion level
for each distortion type. There were overlaps of the conﬁdence
intervals for Gaussian noise, stitching and VP9 distortions.
Overlaps occurred at higher distortion levels for Gaussian
noise, at lower distortion levels for VP9 and over all regions
for stitching distortions. This indicates that more severe Gaus-
sian noise distortions as were light VP9 distortions were rated
similarly, while stitching distortions were less consistently
rated overall.

V. OBJECTIVE IQA MODEL COMPARISON

When evaluating the performance of IQA methods, we
computed the IQA scores separately on the left and right
images, and used the average of these as the overall IQA
score. Since BRISQUE requires training in advance, we split
the database randomly, using 80% of the data for training, and

7

20% for testing. No contents were shared between training
and testing. On each distortion type, BRISQUE was trained
and tested using only features extracted on images having
the corresponding distortion type, to allow measurement of
the best case median performance, since performance of
BRISQUE degrades in general when it has more distortions to
measure. This process was done 1000 times and the median
value was taken as the ﬁnal IQA score. The IQA scores of the
other methods were processed in the same way to avoid any
bias. We tested and compared the following IQA models on
our database.

1) Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) is the negative log-
arithm of the pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE)
function plus an additive offset between the reference and
distorted images.

2) Weighted-to-Spherically-Uniform PSNR (WS-PSNR) [26]
is a modiﬁcation of PSNR that measures distortions in
representation space and weights distortions according to
the corresponding projection area in observation space.
3) Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is a widely used full
reference image quality assessment model [12] which
captures local luminance, contrast, and structural infor-
mation.

4) Multiscale SSIM (MS-SSIM) [13] is a variation of SSIM
that captures quality information across multiple spatial
scales.

5) Visual Saliency-Induced Index (VSI) [17] is a full ref-
erence visual saliency-based IQA method that also inte-
grates gradient magnitude and chrominance features.
6) Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (GMSD) [16] is
a simple gradient-based IQA method. It also uses spatial
deviation pooling to aggregate the quality predictions.
7) FSIM [15] is a full reference IQA method that measures
image quality based on local measurements of phase
congruency and gradient magnitude.

8) Mean Deviation Similarity Index (MDSI) [18] is a full
reference image quality evaluator that fuses gradient
similarity, chromaticit, and deviation pooling features.
9) Spherical Structural Similarity Index (S-SSIM) [27] is a
weighted-to-spherically-uniform VR-IQA method which
scales pixels with equal mapped spherical areas by equal
factors when measuring distortion using SSIM.

10) BRISQUE [19] is a NR IQA model that uses natural scene

statistics features deﬁned in the spatial domain.

11) NIQE [20] is a completely blind (unsupervised) image
quality assessment model,
in which the quality of a
distorted image is computed in terms of its distance from
a learned NSS model.

A. Performance of Objective Methods

We tested the performance of the just-listed objective IQA
models using three metrics: the Spearman’s Rank Order Cor-
relation Coefﬁcient (SROCC), the Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefﬁcient (PLCC), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
The SROCC assesses how well the relationship between an
objective model prediction and human subjective scores can
be described using a monotonic function. The PLCC measures
the accuracy of prediction of different objective models after

performing a nonlinear logistic regression. We used a ﬁve-
parameter logistic function:

f (x) = β1(

−

eβ2(x−β3)

) + β4x + β5

(3)

where x are the predicted scores, f (x) is the mapped score,
and βi(i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are parameters to be ﬁtted that
minimize the mean squared error between the mapped scores
and the subjective scores. The Root Mean Squared Error is the
standard deviation of the prediction errors. The performances
of the compared IQA models is listed in Tables III, IV and
V. In addition, scatter plots of all of the considered objective
IQA models against DMOS are shown in Figure 12.

C. Analysis of Eye Tracking Data

We calculated gaze maps using the eye tracking data
recorded by the Tobii Pro. To do so, we added all gaze
points for the same content, treated each as an impulse, and
smoothed them by applying a Gaussian function with standard
deviation of 3.34° [41]. The computed gaze maps are plotted
in Figure 13. We also calculated the distribution of viewing
direction for all images, as shown in Figure 14. To visualize
the distributions of viewing direction with regards to the
considered distortions, exemplar plots for four of the contents
are shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16. Example gaze maps
on different distortions of the same content are also shown in
Figure 17.

B. Statistical Evaluation

D. Discussion of Results

To evaluate whether two IQA methods are signiﬁcantly
different, we performed an F-test on the residuals between the
IQA scores after non-linear mapping and the DMOS [2]. The
assumption is that the two sets of residuals are Gaussian with
zero means. Thus, to test whether they come from the same
distribution depends on whether they have the same variance.
The null hypothesis is that the residuals from one IQA come
from the same distribution and are statistically indistinguish-
able from the residuals from another IQA. Each entry in
the table consists of 6 symbols. A value of ‘1’ in the table
represents that the row algorithm is statistically superior to the
column algorithm, while a value of ‘0’ means the opposite. A
value of ‘-’ indicates that the row and column algorithms are
statistically indistinguishable (or equivalent). The position of
the symbols corresponds to the following datasets: Gaussian
blur, Gaussian noise, downsampling, stitching, VP9, H.265,
and all data. The results are shown in Table VI.

From Table III, IV and V, we can conclude that among
all methods tested, GMSD generally performed the best while
NIQE performed the worst. While WS-PSNR seems to per-
form better with respect to PLCC on stitching distortions,
from Table VI, we may see that GMSD provided better
quality predictions overall as compared to all other models.
WS-PSNR rewards locality, hence its good performance on
the stitching distortions. Since stitching distortion is highly
local and it greatly affects the overall score, the deviation
pooling used in GMSD is more efﬁcient
in capturing it
than methods using average pooling. In addition, stitching
distortion adds weak edges, which can be detected using the
gradient map of images. Though MDSI also uses deviation
pooling, it utilizes a fused gradient similarity map which is
less efﬁcient in detecting weak edges. As a result, it did not
perform as well. From the scatter plots, it is interesting to
notice that for several algorithms, the correlations for stitching

distortions were very poor. This might be because of the
locality property of stitching distortion that makes it more
difﬁcult. It was also interesting that both WS-PSNR and S-
SSIM performed better than their counterparts, which means
that applying a reprojection weight to modify traditional IQA
methods can help their performance on VR images. Overall,
GMSD was statistically superior to all of the other compared
methods, while NIQE was statistically inferior to almost all
of the others. Training on the subject data of these 3D VR
images was an important step of the NR models to capture

the unique perceptual peculiarities of the distorted VR image
viewing experience. This is reinforced by the wide disparity
in performance between the trained BRISQUE model and the
training-free NIQE model, since they use the identical set of
features!

From Figure 13 and 14 , we can also conclude that there
exists an equator bias when viewing VR images. Subjects
were more likely to view the center of the image (center
bias), but this also depended on the content and whether there
were objects of interest near the center. A good example is

Figure 13(e), where the subjects’ gaze was more attracted to
the person in the image than to the building, although it is
located at the center of the image. From Figure 15, we can
see that on the various considered distortions, the distributions
of the latitude viewing directions all followed the equator
bias. But from Figure 16, it may be observed that this was
not usually the case for the longitude viewing directions. For

all of the considered distortions, the distributions tended to
follow a similar trend, but on speciﬁc local distortions, the
directions of interests might shift, as shown in Figure 16(a).
By comparing the gaze maps of Figure 16(a) with Figure 17,
we can see that the areas of interests shifted when stitching
distortion was present. The appearance of stitching artifacts is
much more localized as compared to other distortions.

of subjective and objective picture quality,” IEEE Trans. Image Process.,
vol. 25, no. 1, pp. 372–387, 2016.

We have created a comprehensive 3D immersive image
database with 15 different contents and 6 distortion categories
rated by 40 subjects. This database is the ﬁrst to evaluate
the gaze-tracked quality of stereoscopic 3D VR images in an
immersive environment. We also evaluated the performance
evaluation of eleven popular image quality assessment algo-
rithms. As with all LIVE Databases [42], the new LIVE 3D
VR IQA Database is being made publicly and freely available
for others to develop improved 2D and 3D VR IQA algorithms.
Future work will focus on the use of visual saliency models
using the eye tracking data provided with this database, as well
as developing algorithms that target VR-speciﬁc distortions
like stitching, ghosting, and vignetting.
