SEMICLASSICAL STATES FOR CHOQUARD TYPE EQUATIONS WITH CRITICAL
GROWTH: CRITICAL FREQUENCY CASE

YANHENG DING, FASHUN GAO, AND MINBO YANG∗

Abstract. In this paper we are interested in the existence of semiclassical states for the Choquard type
equation

−ε2∆u + V (x)u = (cid:16) ˆRN

G(u(y))
|x − y|µ

dy(cid:17)g(u)

in RN ,

where 0 < µ < N , N ≥ 3, ε is a positive parameter and G is the primitive of g which is of critical
growth due to the Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequality. The potential function V (x) is assumed to be
nonnegative with V (x) = 0 in some region of RN , which means it is of the critical frequency case. Firstly,
we study a Choquard equation with double critical exponents and prove the existence and multiplicity
of semiclassical states by the Mountain-Pass Lemma and the genus theory. Secondly, we consider a class
of critical Choquard equation without lower perturbation, by establishing a global Compactness lemma
for the nonlocal Choquard equation, we prove the multiplicity of high energy semiclassical states by the
Lusternik–Schnirelman theory.

As ε goes to zero, the study of the existence and asymptotic behavior of the solutions is known as the
semiclassical problem which was used to describe the transition between Quantum Mechanics and Classical
Mechanics. In mathematical aspects the study of semiclassical problem goes back to the pioneer work [29]
by Floer and Weinstein. Since then, it has been studied extensively under various hypotheses on the
potentials and the nonlinearities, see for example [7, 8, 19, 20, 22, 26–28, 32, 33, 46–48, 53, 54, 58] and the
references therein.

However nonlocality appears naturally in optical systems with a thermal [38] and it is known to inﬂuence
the propagation of electromagnetic waves in plasmas [14]. Nonlocality also has attracted considerable
interest as a means of eliminating collapse and stabilizing multidimensional solitary waves [10] and it plays
an important role in the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation [25] where it accounts for the ﬁnite-range
many-body interactions. If K(x) is a function of Riesz type K(x) = 1
|x|µ , then we arrive at the singularly
perturbed Choquard type equation

was introduced in mathematical physics by Pekar [45] to study the quantum theory of a polaron at rest. It
was mentioned in [35] that Choquard applied it as approximation to Hartree-Fock theory of one-component
plasma. This equation was also proposed by Penrose in [40] as a model of selfgravitating matter and is known
in that context as the Schr¨odinger-Newton equation. Mathematically, Lieb [35] and Lions [37] studied the
existence and uniqueness of positive solutions to equation (1.4). The uniqueness and non-degeneracy of the
ground states were proved in Lenzmann [34], Wei and Winter in [52].

To study problem (1.3) variationally, we will use the following Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequality

frequently, see [36].

Proposition 1.1. (Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequality). Let t, r > 1 and 0 < µ < N with 1/t + µ/N +
Lr(RN ). There exists a sharp constant C(t, N, µ, r), independent of f, h,
1/r = 2, f

under some assumptions on µ, p and N , they proved that all the positive solutions of (1.7) must be

completely investigated the qualitative properties of solutions of (1.7) and showed the regularity, positivity

then it is easy to see that there are no nontrivial solutions. Because the problem was set in RN and the
convolution type nonlinearities are of critical growth, it is quite diﬃcult to study the critical Choquard
equation (1.7) due to the loose of compact embedding. For the upper critical exponent case, a critical
Choquard type equation on a bounded domain of RN , N
3 was investigated in [30], there the authors
generalized the well-known results obtained in [16]. The critical Choquard equation set on the whole space
was investigated in [2, 3], where the authors studied the case N = 2 with exponential critical growth and
the case N

3 with upper critical exponents separately.

existence of ground states were obtained in [3] by applying the Brezis-Nirenberg methods. The planar case
was considered in [2], where the authors ﬁrst established the existence of ground state for the problem with
critical exponential growth. If V (x) changes sign, the operator
∆ + V has essential spectrum below 0 and
then equation (3.2) becomes strongly indeﬁnite. In contrast to the positive deﬁnite case, it becomes more
complicated to study the strongly indeﬁnite Choquard equation due to the appearance of convolution part.
For p = 2 and µ = 1, the existence of one nontrivial solution was obtained in [18] by reduction arguments.

For the Choquard equation with lower critical exponent, Moroz and Van Schaftingen [43] studied the
existence of solutions by perturbing the linear part suitably. For recent progress on the study of the
Choquard equation we may refer the readers to [4, 44] for details.

The semiclassical problem for the Choquard equation has also attracted a lot interest recently. As far

as we know there are some papers considered the equation of the type

(1.12). If inf V > 0, Wei and Winter also constructed families of solutions by a Lyapunov-Schmidt type

Cingolani et.al. [24] applied the penalization arguments due to Byeon and Jeanjean [17] and showed that

In [5, 6], by applying penalization method and Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory,
Alves and Yang proved the existence, multiplicity and concentration of solutions for the equation (1.10)
with subcritical nonlinearities. For the critical growth case, the authors in [3] studied

states and then characterized the concentration behavior around the the global minimum set of V or
the global maximum set of Q. The planar case was investigated in [2], there the authors observed the
concentration of the maximum points of the solutions around the global minimum set of the potential.

In the present paper we continue to study the semiclassical problem for the Choquard equation, but
instead of problem (1.10), we are going to study problem (1.3). We must point out that problem (1.3) is
quite diﬀerent from (1.10), since there is no small parameter in front of the nonlinear convolution part.

(1.3) can still be transformed into an equivalent form (1.11). However, this scaling transformation does not
apply for equation (1.3) with general nonlinearities, even for g(u) = up + uq, p
= q. Involving the existence
of semiclassical states of equation (1.3), there are not so many results. If the nonlinearity is subcritical and

by using the local realization by means of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, they were able to establish
the existence of single-spike solution concentrating around the local minimum set of V (x) by penalization
techniques.

From the comments above, we know that the existing results for problem (1.3) with critical frequency
inf V (x) = 0 are all about the subcritical case. And there seems no existence and multiplicity results for
problem (1.3) with both of the upper critical growth and critical frequency. Then it is quite natural to ask
if we can establish existence and multiplicity of standing waves with critical frequency for the Choquard
equation with upper critical growth. The aim of the present paper is to give a positive answer to the this
question and we are going to study how the behavior of the nonnegative potentials and the upper critical
exponent will aﬀect the existence and multiplicity of semiclassical states of problem (1.3).

Firstly we are going to study the existence, multiplicity of semiclassical states of the Choquard equation

with double critical exponents, that is

Under some ﬂatness assumption on the potential, we ﬁnd that the combination of the upper critical exponent
and the lower critical exponent will still lead to the existence and multiplicity of semiclassical states with
small energy depending on the parameter ε.

In order to state the main results, we assume that 0 < µ < N and the potential V (x) satisfy

CRITICAL CHOQUARD EQUATIONS

7

An outline of this paper is as follows:

In Section 2, we study the Choquard equation with double
critical exponents and prove the existence of semiclassical states for equation (1.15) by energy estimates
and Mountain-Pass Theorem. We also proved that equation (1.15) has at least m pairs of solutions by
the Krasnoselski genus theory. In Section 3, we prove ﬁrstly a global compactness lemma for the nonlocal
Choquard equation and establish a convergence criteria for the (P S) sequences. And then we prove the
existence of multiple high energy semiclassical solutions of problem (1.16) by the Lusternik–Schnirelman
theory.

2. Critical problem with double critical exponents

To prove the existence of semiclassical states by variational methods, we introduce the Hilbert spaces

E :=

u

2.2. Multiple semiclassical states. In order to obtain the multiplicity of critical points, we will apply
the index theory deﬁned by the Krasnoselski genus. Denote the set of all symmetric (in the sense that

A = A) and closed subsets of E by Σ. For each A

Σ, let gen(A) be the Krasnoselski genus and

∈

−

i(A) := min
h∈Γ

gen(h(A)

∂Bε),

∩

where Γ is the set of all odd homeomorphisms h

(E, E) and ∂Bε is the closed symmetric set

such that Iε|∂Bε ≥

κε > 0. Then i is a version of Benci’s pseudoindex [11]. Let

Then if cεj is ﬁnite and Iε satisﬁes the (P S) condition at cεj, then we know cεj are all critical values for Iε.

Lemma 2.10. Let conditions (V1)

(V3) be satisﬁed, then the functional Iε satisﬁes:

−

(1). for each ε > 0, Iε(0) = 0 there exists ρε > 0 such that κε := inf Iε(∂Bρε ) > 0 where ∂Bρε =

The Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev inequality implies that Iε is well deﬁned on D1,2(RN ) and belongs to
And so u is a weak solution of (1.16) if and only if u is a critical point of the functional Iε.
