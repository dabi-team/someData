A Coordinated Volt/Var Control Scheme for 
Distribution Systems with High DER 
Penetration 

Yue Shi, Member, IEEE, Mesut Baran, Fellow, IEEE 

Abstract—In this paper, a new Volt/Var Control (VVC) scheme 
is proposed to facilitate the coordination between the conventional 
VVC  devices  and  the  new  smart  PV  inverters  to  provide  an 
effective voltage control on a system with high PV penetration. The 
proposed scheme decomposes the problem into two levels. The first 
level uses Load Tap Changer (LTC) and Voltage Regulators (VRs) 
to adjust the voltage level on the circuit to keep the voltages along 
the circuit within the desired range. The second level determines 
Var  support  needed  from  smart  inverters  to  smooth  the  fast 
voltage  variations  while  providing  effective  power  factor 
correction to keep the power losses at  minimum. The case study 
shows  that  the  proposed  VVC  method  is  very  effective  in 
maintaining  acceptable  voltages  on  the  system  under  various 
operating  conditions  while  meeting  the  operational  constrains.  
The results also show the computational efficiency of the method.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

A 

doption  of  Photovoltaics  (PV)  based  systems  at  both 
residential and commercial scale has accelerated recently. 
As more PV systems are integrated into a distribution feeder, 
they will start affecting the voltage control on the feeder, and 
when the voltage variations become excessive, some mitigation 
is needed. Conventional Volt/Var control (VVC) devices on the 
circuit: Load Tap Changer (LTC), Voltage Regulators (VRs), 
and  capacitor  banks  (Caps).  These  devices,  are  slow  acting 
devices  and  usually  employ  local  controllers,  and  hence  they 
cannot provide effective voltage control when PV penetration 
gets  high  on  the  circuit  [1]. The  variability  of  PV  output  can 
also cause excessive operation of traditional VVC devices [2].  
A  promising  approach  recently  emerged  is  the  use  of  the 
inverters (which serve as the main interface for interconnecting 
DERs  to  the  grid)  to  help  mitigate  the  voltage  violations  [3], 
[4].  To  make  effective  use  of  inverters  for  this  purpose, 
operation  of  these  inverters  need  to  be  coordinated  with  the 
existing VVC devices. These smart inverters can respond faster 
to the voltage violations, and local control approaches for these 
inverters  are  currently  being  finalized  under  IEEE  standard

1547 [3]. This paper focuses on coordination of these new smart 
inverters  with  the  conventional  Volt/Var  control  to  improve 
VVC in systems with considerable PV penetration.  

Most  of  VVC  schemes  proposed  in  the  literature,  aim  at 
determining the set points for the Volt-Var control devices at a 
given  operation  point,  and  thus  formulate  the  VVC  as  an 
optimal  power  flow  problem  [5]-[11].  However,  to  prevent 
excessive  VVC  device  operation  due  to  variability  of  PV 
requires  that  VVC  method  to  consider  a  large  time  horizon. 
Therefore, in this paper we extend the VVC problem and treat 
it as a tracking problem. 

Although the primary goal of VVC is to keep voltages within 
an acceptable range, the other goals include: 1) Power quality, 
such as the improvement of voltage profile and power factor. 2) 
Energy  saving,  for  example  power  loss  reduction  and  peak 
demand  reduction.  3)  Reduction  of  control  cost.  A  common 
approach to solve this multi-objective problem is to choose one 
as  the  main  goal  and  try  to  handle  the  others  by  adding 
constraints in the optimization method adopted [6]-[9]. 

Recently  proposed  VVC  methods  usually  adopt  a  model 
based optimization method [6]-[11]. Since VVC is a complex 
optimization problem, even for a single operating point, usually 
some approximation is adopted to solve the problem [12], [13]. 
Efforts have also been made to develop decentralized schemes 
[9], [14], [15], rather than SCADA based centralized schemes 
[6]-[8],  in  order  to  minimize  the  SCADA  requirements. 
However, performance of these methods is usually limited by 
the lack of system level model [19]-[21]. As a trade-off between 
centralized and decentralized  approach, this paper proposes a 
master-slave  architecture,  which  facilitates  the  coordination 
between the conventional control devices and PV inverters to 
provide an effective voltage control on a system with high PV 
penetration.  The  proposed  method  adopts  a  two-level  VVC 
architecture  in  which  smart  inverters  coordinate  with  other 
conventional VVC devices to provide effective voltage control 
on the feeder and to  mitigate excessive operation of LTC and 
VRs.  This  approach 
is  computationally  efficient  and 
accommodates  the  operational  constraints.  Thus,  the  method 
can be easily adopted for practical implementation. This is the 
other contribution of the paper.  

The paper is organized as follows: Section II illustrates how 
the problem is decomposed in two loops, a slower outer loop 
and  a  faster  inner  loop  in  order  to  coordinate  operation  of 

 
 
 
 
conventional VVC devices with smart inverters. Section II also 
presents the methods adopted to solve the sub-problems at each 
level. Simulation results are presented and discussed in Section 
III.  Finally,  Section  IV  summarizes  the  advantages  of  the 
proposed coordinated VVC scheme and concludes the paper. 

II.  COORDINATED VOLT/VAR CONTROL  

As  indicated  above,  the  goal  for  VVC  is  to  track  both  the 
slower load variations and the faster PV variations on a feeder 
with  the  goal  of  minimizing  voltage  variations  while  also 
avoiding the excessive operation of Voltage Regulators (VRs) 
and Cap Banks which may occur due to high variability in PV 
output.    To  achieve  this,  we  make  use  of  the  fact  that  the 
conventional VVC devices are intended to operate  at a  much 
slower pace than the smart inverters. Also,  while the VRs are 
mainly designed to adjust the voltages, Cap Banks and Smart 
Inverters are mainly reactive power support devices for power 
factor  correction  (and  thus  helps  lowering  the  power  losses). 
These  features  of  VVC  devices  helps  us  to  decompose  the 
problem [5]. This paper adopts this approach and decomposes 
the VVC problem into two loops, a slower voltage control loop 
and a faster Var compensation loop. Fig. 1 shows the proposed 
architecture. 

Voltage Control Loop 

The  voltage  control  devices,  LTC  and  VRs,  are  very 
effective in adjusting the voltage along the feeder, but they are 
slow acting devices. Hence, the goal in voltage control loop is 
to monitor the net load variations along the feeder, filter out the 
fast  variations  and  have  the  voltage  control  devices  respond 
only  to  slow  variations.  This  prevent  excessive  device 
operation.  This loop is slow, (which is chosen as 15 min in this 
paper) and provides the supervisory set points for the LTC and 
VRs. Details of the method adopted for this module is presented 
later in this section.  

Var Compensation Loop 

This  loop  provides  supervisory  set  points  for  the  smart 
inverters, and since these inverters are fast acting, this loop can 
be  faster  than  the  voltage  control  loop  (we  chose  it  to  be  5 
minutes). The main goal of this fast acting loop is to respond 
the  over/under  voltage  violations  that  may  occur  due  to  fast 
variability in PV output. If there is not enough Var support to 
correct the voltage violations, then this loop sends a signal to 
voltage control loop to have the voltage regulation devices to 
respond immediately. As indicated in Fig. 1, when there is no 
voltage  violation,  the  control  objective  changes,  and  the  loop 
determines Var compensation levels for the inverters in order 
to  minimize  the  power  loss  on  the  feeder.  An  optimization 
method is used to determine the proper Var support from the 
inverters in both cases. Details of this module are given later in 
this section. 

A.  Voltage Control Method 

As indicated before, the goal of the voltage control module 
is to monitor load variations and adjust voltage levels by using 
the LTC and VRs such that the voltages will remain within the 
acceptable range within the control window. Hence, as Fig. 1 

2 

Fig. 1 Two-level coordinated Volt/Var Control 

illustrates, once the module gets a new load update (assumed to 
be  every  five  minutes),  the  program  first  checks  if  the  load 
change  is  big  enough  to  cause  voltage  violation  without  Var 
support  from  inverters.  If  this  is  the  case,  and  this  condition 
persists during the control cycle then this indicates that the load 
has changed enough for the module to adjust voltage levels.  

Since,  LTC  and  VRs  operate  by  adjusting  their  taps,  the 
proper set point can best be determined by calculating the new 
tap  positions  needed.  Although  number  of  LTC  or  VRs  on  a 
distribution feeder are usually low, the number of possible tap 
positions each device  has (usually 33 tap  positions, including 
the zero-tap position) can make the search space considerably 
large, as the VRs usually operate on a phase basis.  For example, 
a system with one LTC and one VR has 33 × 33 × 33 × 33 =
1,185,92 possible  tap  position  combinations.    To  reduce  the 
search, a search method based on [16] has been developed. The 
method is based on the observation that  most of the time tap 
adjustments needed are small. Hence, instead of searching all 
possible 33 taps, the method considers moving the current tap 

of each device by two taps up and down:

. We found that this search can be reduced further by applying 
the additional rules given in Fig. 2. As the figure shows, starting 
from the  voltage control device  closest to the substation (e.g. 
LTC), tap position of that device varies while keeping the taps 
constant  for  other  downstream  voltage  control  devices.  Then 

voltage  is  calculated  for  each 

.  In  Fig.  2,  p 

represents phase a, b, or c. The idea behind the rules is to avoid 
searching  the  increasing  taps  when  over-voltage  violation 
occurs and to avoid searching the decreasing taps when under-
voltage violation occurs.  

Note that there are usually many different tap combinations 
that  will  bring  the  node  voltages  within  the  limits.  Hence,  a 
criterion  is  needed  to  select  a  solution.  In  this  paper,  the  tap 
position  combination  with  least  power  loss  is  selected  as  the

For  the  second  case,  when  we  need  to  determine  the  extra 

Var support, the objective function becomes: 

3 

(6)   

where 

which aims at determining the minimum Var support needed to 
bring  the  node  voltages  within  the  limits  (which  are  taken  as 
0.95 to 1.05 p.u.[17]). 

 Note  that  this  is  a  non-linear  programming  problem  with 
continuous  control  variables,  as  inverter  Var  support  is 
continuously  adjustable.  Sequential  line  search  methods  [12], 
[13], and Successive Linear Programming (SLP) methods [18] 
have been proposed to obtain the solution.  However, the SLP 
based method takes much time to update linear model and the 
linear trust region is usually not a good approximation [19].  

In this paper, a gradient based method is adopted to solve the 
Var problem. Essentially, the proposed gradient based method 
is a sequential line search method along the direction of steepest 
descent.  The  steepest  descent  (negative  gradient)  of  the 
objective function with respect to the control variables, −∇𝑓𝑢, 
provides  an  effective  direction  for  updating  the  control  [20], 
[21].  This  method  is  also  easy  to  implement  as  no  second 
derivative is needed. Furthermore, in this application, the past 
operating  point  provides  a  good  starting  point  for  the  next 
control update. 

Fig.  3  shows  how  the  steepest  descent  (updated  gradient 
method)  is  applied  to  solve  the  Var  problem.  As  the  figure 
shows, to obtain the optimal  solution, the gradient  is updated 
iteratively and an optimal step-size needs to be determined in 
each steepest descent direction. In this figure, the iterator i is for 
the outside loop to update the gradient. In each search along the 
steepest descent, the gradient ∇𝑓𝑢(𝑖)  is calculated first (details 
of  calculating  ∇𝑓𝑢  is  given  in  the  appendix),  and  then  the 
control variable is updated as 

(7)                    

In each gradient update, the challenge is to determine the best 
step size β*(i) such that the objective function (power loss) is 
minimized without violating voltage constrains. The best-step 
size  𝛽∗  can  be  found  by  an  inner  loop  search  where 
is 
 (1)                            
updated as    
(2) 

(8) 
for some γ > 1. The largest β(k) which achieves the maximum 
power  loss  reduction  without  violating  the  constraints  is 
selected  as 𝛽∗.  There’re  also  other  methods  such  as  Armijo’s 
rule [12] to determine 𝛽∗. However, adoption of this rule is not 
easy for a complex function like power loss function  [12], [13]. 
In the proposed method, the initial value β(0) is selected such 
that  the  minimum  Var  support  adjustment,  |∆𝑢|𝑚𝑖𝑛  is  some 
small value, for example 0.01 kVar.  

C.  A Master-Slave Control Architecture  

In a smart distribution system, Intelligent Electronic Devices 
(IEDs) enable communication and processing capability at the 
feeder level. In this study, each PV smart inverter is assumed to

criterion, as the power loss reduction is another goal of VVC. 
A  backward-forward  distribution  power  flow  solver,  DPF,  is 
used  to  determine  how  the  node  voltages  change  as  control 
variables are varied.   

B.  Var Compensation Method 

As  indicated  above,  this  module  uses  an  optimization 
method  to  determine  the  proper  Var  support  needed  from 
inverters  in  the  system.  The  objective  of  Var  compensation, 
under  normal  conditions,  is  to  improve  system  efficiency  by 
reducing  power  loss  on  the  system.  However,  when  there  is 
need for extra Var support for boosting the voltages, the module 
determines this extra Var support first.  

The  Var  compensation  problem  is  formulated  as  an 

optimization problem: 

s.t.

contains  the 
control variables, i.e. the Var support from smart inverters, 𝑄𝑖𝑛𝑣 
and  the  equality  constraints  (2)  correspond  to  power  flow 
equations.  

The objective function f, as indicated, is the power loss on the 
system under normal conditions. As the total power loss is the 
sum of the line losses,  f  will be:

have this capability - and by making use of it- we developed a 
master-slave  based  control  scheme  for  VVC  rather  than 
conventional  centralized  SCADA  based  control  architecture 
which requires all the data from the feeder to be sent to a central 
control  center.  In  the  proposed  scheme,  the  proposed  VVC 
scheme is implemented in a master controller which can sit at a 
local substation. The master controller then communicates with 
slave controllers which are implemented IEDs located near to 
PV  clusters.  These  slave  controllers  control  a  group  of  PV 
inverters. Details of this approach are given below. 

group the inverters on a feeder into smaller clusters and form a 
master-slave architecture.   

    2)  Master VVC unit and slave VVC units 

To  coordinate  the  control  among  the  groups,  a  “master 
controller”  is  used  to  act  as  a  supervisory  controller  and  to 
provide the update signals to slave units based on the proposed 
method. For Var compensation, the solution 𝑢∗is partitioned as 
shown in Fig. 4 according to the grouping of inverters and then 
sent to the corresponding slave units. The index j refers to index 

    1)  Grouping of the VVC devices 

Since  a  distribution  feeder  line  section  can  be  rather  short, 
the  distance  between  smart  inverters  can  be  short.  And 

therefore, sensitivity of the power loss with respect to 

 of 

Fig. 4 Partition of the solution of Var optimization 

smart inverters that are close to each other will be very similar. 
Indeed, when we examine the gradient ∇𝑓𝑢 we can see that it is 
the  case.  This  observation  indicates  that  we  can  group  the 
inverters  that  are  close  to  each  other  together  and  put  them 
under a local “slave controller”, so that all the inverters in this 
group can be controlled together. This is the approach used to 

of VVC slaves, and the vector

,  slave  j  allocates  the  reactive  power 
injection  based  on  the  capacity  of  reactive  power  support  of 
inverters. For each smart inverter i under VVC slave j:

where 

is  the  total  number  of  inverters  under  the  slave  j, 

is the reactive power capacity of inverter i under slave j.  

 Note  that  the  inverter  Var  capacity  depends  on  its  power 
output. To provide sufficient reactive power support when PV 
generation is high, the inverters are oversized with 25% more 

than  peak  generation,  i.e. 

.  Therefore,  the 

available reactive power varies as the PV output, PPV, changes:

III.  TEST RESULTS 

A.  Test System 

To  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  VVC 
scheme, the IEEE 34 node test feeder [22] is modified with PVs 
connected  to  all  nodes  with  load.  Since  these  inverters  can 
provide sufficient reactive power to improve the voltage profile, 
only one VR is needed in this modified system, and hence VR#2 
and Caps are removed. A three-phase controlled LTC is placed

thus the gradient update may not be needed. Indeed, the solution 
given in Fig. 8 does not update the gradient.   

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed gradient method, 
the  sequential  linear  programing  (SLP)  method  is  applied  to 
solve the same Var optimization problem. Table I compares the 
solution (Var compensation) from the two methods. As Table 1 
shows, the proposed gradient method reduces the power loss to 
210.077 kW which is close to the result of SLP method, 209.992 
kW.  Fig.  10  shows  the  new  voltage  profiles  obtained  by  two 
methods. Note that the new voltage profiles of two methods are  
nearly the same, and hence, these results confirm that proposed 
method  provides  very  good  solution.  Finally,  note  that  the 
proposed method is computationally much more efficient; the 
runtime  for  gradient  method  is  1.002s  which  is  much  shorter 
than SLP’s runtime, 5.902s.

at  the  substation,  and  three  phases  of  the  VR  is  controlled 
independently.  Fig.  6  shows  how  the  inverters  are  grouped 
based on sensitivity/gradient analysis. As the figure shows, in 
this  case  20  inverters  are  divided  into  6  groups.  To  simulate 
operation of the test feeder on a typical day, a 24-hour PV and 
load profile with a 5-min resolution, shown in Fig. 7, is used. 
Note that this corresponds to a challenging case as there is high 
PV  variability  causing  even  reverse  power  flow  during  short 
periods on the system.

B.  Performance of Var compensation method  

To validate the performance of the proposed gradient based 
method  for  Var  compensation,  two  operating  conditions  are 
simulated.  

Case 1: heavy load 

  This case illustrates the performance of the proposed Var 
compensation  method  during  the  peak  load  condition.  At  the 
initial starting point, there is no voltage violation, and hence the 
Var compensation tries to minimize the total power loss on the 
feeder.    Initial  Var  compensation  for  the  inverters  is  chosen 
such that it compensates for the reactive power of the local load.  

The initial step-size, β(0), corresponds to 

and 

 is selected to be 1.1.  

Fig.  8  shows  the  power  loss  reduction  obtained  during  the 
iterations of the gradient based method.   Fig. 9 shows typical 
convergence  profile  of  the  steepest  descent  method:  good 
monotone convergence during the first few iterations and then 
convergence  slows  down  as  the  solution  gets  close  to  the 
optimal  point.  This  indicates  that  in  practice  only  a  few 
iterations are needed to get a good solution.  Furthermore, our 
investigations  indicate  that  updating  the  gradient  at  every 
iteration does not improve the objective value considerably, and 

Fig.  10 Phase A feeder voltages for Case 1 

Case2: Light load 

Case 2 simulates the extra Var support needed during a light 
load  condition  where  voltage  violation  occurs  due  to  sudden 
change in PV output (event corresponds to 10:05 am in Fig. 7). 
In this case, LTC and VR do not respond to this event, but the 
Var  support  module  reacts  and  determines  extra  Var  support 
needed  from  the  inverter  to  eliminate  the  voltage  violation. 
Here, the gradient is updated because as the indicator variables

𝑤𝑖 change, they affect the gradient vector considerably. Fig. 11 
shows  how  the  node  voltages  during  the  iterations  of  the 
method. As the figure shows, the node voltages move towards 
the  acceptable  ranges  quite  rapidly  and  it  takes  only  a  few 
iterations to bring the voltages within 0.95 – 1.05 p.u.

C.  Performance of the VVC method 

A 24-h simulation is performed to verify the effectiveness of 
the proposed scheme. At the beginning of every control period 
of 5 minute, data for the new operating point (net load at each 
node) is obtained first by running the DPF. The VVC method is 
then run to determine the updated settings for the VVC devices. 
These  new  settings  are  then  sent  to  the  system  (which  is 
simulated  using  DPF)  and  this  control  cycle  is  repeated  in  5 
minute increments. 

Fig. 12 shows how the voltage control devices, LTC and VR, 
are  controlled.  From  the  results  we  can  see  that  there  is  no 
excessive operation of the devices.  Fig. 13 illustrates the reason 
for  each  operation.  Markers  “  *  ”  indicates  the  LTC/VR 
operation under normal conditions, i.e. the net load change in 

6 

15-min  period  is  large  enough  to  warrant  adjustment  of  tap 
settings.  Markers “ o ” indicate the tap adjustment needed when 
there  is  not  enough  Var  support  from  inverters  to  keep  the 
voltages within limit, therefore these operations can mainly be 
considered  as  the  extra  operations  due  to  power  variability 
caused by PVs. Markers “ + ” on the figure indicate Var support 
from  inverters  when  voltage  violation  occurs  due  to  sudden 
change in PV output. These points thus show that indeed Var 
support helps to respond the sudden voltage violations quickly 
and  this  in  turn  reduces  the  excessive  operation  of  voltage 
regulation devices. Fig.14 confirms that the system maximum 
and minimum voltages are always kept within the range 0.95 – 
1.05 p.u. 

Fig. 15 shows the Var support from the inverter at Node 830 
phase B. The simulation indicates that Var support is adjusted 
throughout the day for both loss reduction as well as for voltage 
control,  and  majority  of  the  smaller  adjustments  are  for  loss 
reduction under normal conditions (ie. no extra var support for 
voltage control).    

Fig. 16 shows the power loss profile under both the proposed 
method and the conventional VVC (used on the IEEE 34 node 
test  feeder)  during  the  day.  The  results  indicate  that  the 
proposed  VVC  provides  considerable  power  loss  reduction 
compared  to  the  conventional  VVC  scheme:  the  total  energy 
loss during the day in this case is 36.7% lower than that of the 
conventional  VVC  scheme.  Fig.  17  shows  the  Phase  A  tap 
operations of two VRs in the original system. As expected, with 
variability of system PV output and load, as shown in Fig. 7, 
conventional VR control results in excessive tap operations. 

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed  voltage control 
scheme, the 24-h simulation is repeated with a different voltage 
control  scheme.  In  this  case,  an  exhaustive  search  method 
employed for determining the optimal tap settings for voltage 
control  devices  when  they  need  to  respond  to  slow  load

Finally,  the  computation  time  of  the  proposed  coordinated 
VVC  method  is  quite  low,  288  executions  of  the  program 
(during 24-h simulation) takes 123s (0.43s per operating point 
on average). This clearly indicates the feasibility of the method 
in practice. 

IV.  CONCLUSIONS 

In  this  paper,  a  two-level  coordinated  Volt/Var  control  is 
proposed.  The  IEEE  34  node  test  feeder  is  used  to  test  the 
performance of proposed VVC scheme. The results show that 
the method handles the three operational requirements for VVC 
effectively: maintaining the node voltages within limits while 
avoiding  excessive  device  operations,  and  reducing  power 
losses. The test results also show that proposed gradient method 
for Var compensation is very effective in determining the Var 
support  from  DERs.  Results  based  on  a  daily  operation  also 
verify that the method minimizes the operation of the LTC and 
VR by using Var support from smart inverters to respond to the 
voltage variations caused by variable PV output.  

Runtime results also show that the proposed VVC method is 

fast and therefore appropriate for practical implementation.

V.  APPENDIX 

Calculation of Gradient 

Since  the  objective  function  in  the  Var  compensation 
problem in Section II is function of x only, we can use chain 
rule to calculate the reduced gradient 

 as follows:

changes. Fig. 18 and Fig. 19 show the LTC and VR Phase A tap 
profiles  for  the  two  methods.  The  two  figures  show  that  the 
exhaustive search method moves the taps more often with finer 
adjustments,  as  expected.  The  main  benefits  of 
these 
adjustments  are  better  loss  reduction,  as  shown  in  Fig.  20. 
However, the cost associated with excessive tap operation may 
outweigh the additional improvement in power loss reduction.
