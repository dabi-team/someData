Abstract Immersive Colonography allows medical pro-
fessionals to navigate inside the intricate tubular ge-
ometries of subject-speciﬁc 3D colon images using Vir-
tual Reality displays. Typically, camera travel is per-
formed via Fly-Through or Fly-Over techniques that
enable semi-automatic traveling through a constrained,
well-deﬁned path at user controlled speeds. However,
Fly-Through is known to limit the visibility of lesions
located behind or inside haustral folds, while Fly-Over
requires splitting the entire colon visualization into two
speciﬁc halves. In this paper, we study the eﬀect of im-
mersive Fly-Through and Fly-Over techniques on lesion
detection, and introduce a camera travel technique that
maintains a ﬁxed camera orientation throughout the
entire medial axis path. While these techniques have
been studied in non-VR desktop environments, their
performance is yet not well understood in VR setups.
We performed a comparative study to ascertain which
camera travel technique is more appropriate for con-
strained path navigation in Immersive Colonography.
To this end, we asked 18 participants to navigate in-
side a 3D colon to ﬁnd speciﬁc marks. Our results sug-
gest that the Fly-Over technique may lead to enhanced
lesion detection at the cost of higher task completion
times, while the Fly-Through method may oﬀer a more
balanced trade-oﬀ between both speed and eﬀective-
ness, whereas the ﬁxed camera orientation technique
provided seemingly inferior performance results. Our

1 Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
of cancer-related death in the western world with an
estimated 1.4 million new cases every year worldwide,
half of which end in death [1]. Computed Tomography
Colonography (CTC) is an imaging technique that has
been widely adopted for colonic examination for diag-
nostic purposes. Still, the colon is an organ with several
inﬂections and numerous colonic haustral folds along its
extension, which make navigation inside CTC 3D mod-
els a hard task [2].

While analyzing CTC content, radiologists work in
the standard workstation, i.e., desktop, monitor, mouse
and keyboard. However, using a 2D display to analyze
3D structures can lead to missing information [3]. As
conventional systems rely on 2D input devices and sta-
tionary ﬂat displays, users often struggle to obtain the
desired camera position and orientation, which requires
several cumulative rotations, hence, making it hard to
perceive the colon structure in 3D. To visualize such
anatomically complex data, the immersion and freedom
of movement aﬀorded by VR systems bare the promise
to assist clinicians to improve 3D reading, namely en-
abling more expedite diagnoses [4].

Travel is considered the most basic and important
component of the VR experience, which is responsible
for changing the user’s viewpoint position and rota-
tion in a given direction [5]. Due to the complexity of
large virtual environments, certain authors apply travel

techniques that rely on path planning, i.e. path-based
or path-constrained travel. In this family of techniques
the user follows a previously deﬁned path, where users
can still control speed, viewpoint direction and local
deviation, so that they can locally explore the virtual
environment [6,7]. Path-based travel can also be done
automatically, where both the path and the movement
are predeﬁned in a way that creates a smooth naviga-
tion experience. Such features are welcomed for virtual
endoscopy applications [8,9,10].

Considering the complexity of the colon’s structure,
travel follows a semi-automatic procedure which relies
on centerline estimation to constrain the direction of
movement, while users are given control over speed.
The most conventional way of CTC travel consists of
the Fly-Through technique [11], where camera orienta-
tion follows the centerline’s direction. Nonetheless, the
use of VR could enable more natural means of travel by
decoupling camera orientation from direction of move-
ment, in the sense that relative orientation can diﬀer
from the centerline’s direction. That is the case of the
Fly-Over technique, where relative orientation is per-
pendicular to the centerline’s direction [12]. Although
these techniques are commonly used in conventional
setups, they have yet to be fully investigated in VR
settings. Our work focuses on camera travel as a key
component on surveying and identifying pathological
features in CTC datasets. The semi-automatic nature
of the process combined with the abrupt movements
caused by the complexity of the colon’s structure, may
cause unwanted side-eﬀects due to the diﬀerence be-
tween camera orientation in the virtual world and the
user’s real orientation [13]. To overcome this issue, we
propose a technique called Elevator, where camera ori-
entation is changed in order to match the user’s real
orientation. Using an immersive colonoscopy prototype
[14] we studied camera control techniques and their ef-
fectiveness on comprehensive landmark identiﬁcation in
order to address the following question: Which of the
considered visualization techniques is the most suitable
to navigate inside the 3D reconstructed model of the
colon?

2 Related Work

Navigation inside colon structures is a diﬃcult and non-
trivial task to perform. The Fly-Through technique has
been widely adopted since it was ﬁrst proposed by Lichan
Hong [11]. Radiologists tend to prefer this type of visu-
alization due to its similarities with conventional colonos-
copy, which include dealing with the same type of lim-
itations. While moving in a given direction, lesion visi-
bility is limited to the colorectal tissue that is exposed

to the normal of the viewing camera, which may lead
to missing signiﬁcant lesions. In order to address this
and reduce redundancy, colorectal ﬂattening proposed
mapping the colon’s cylindrical surface to a rectangu-
lar surface to create a full virtual view of the colon [15].
Nonetheless, ﬂattening algorithms are prone to error
and require additional training to understand such 2D
representation of the colon [16]. The unfolded cube pro-
jection proposed projecting all views of the colon on the
inside of a cube using six camera normals that move to-
gether along the centerline [17]. Even though unfolding
the cube enhances lesion visibility, scanning all sides
of the cube is a time-consuming task. Fly-Over is an-
other visualization technique that tries to solve Fly-
Through’s limitations. In this case, the colon is divided
in two unique halves by the centerline, each with a vir-
tual camera [12]. This enables perpendicular perspec-
tive, producing increased surface coverage (99% of sur-
face visibility in one direction vs 93% in Fly-Through in
two navigation directions) and equally good sensitivity.
In spite of the Fly-Over’s positive impact, current CTC
softwares, such as the V3D-Colon1, syngo.CT Colonog-
raphy2 only include Fly-Through, ﬂattening and the
unfolded cube visualization techniques, since the use of
the Fly-Over is restricted for patenting reasons. Still, all
of these techniques continue to suﬀer from the drawback
of using a 2D interface to interact with a 3D model.

Since its inception, Virtual Reality (VR) has found
applications across the medical domain, namely in med-
ical education [18], surgical planning and training tasks
[19,20,21]. More recently, VR has also been applied to
diagnosis [22,23, 24], where being able to carefully ex-
amine large and complex image datasets is crucial to
producing insightful and complete results. Thus, con-
trolling viewing position and orientation in expedite
yet precise manners could potentially aﬀect signiﬁcant
medical decisions.

Considering the advantages of VR under the scope
of diagnostic imaging, especially improved camera con-
trol, freedom of movement, 3D perception and enhanced
scale, two groups started to explore the immersive CTC
experience. Mirhosseini et al. investigated a CAVE (Cave
Automatic Virtual Environment) in which the gastroin-
testinal walls were projected onto the room walls [3].
In spite of suggesting potential improvement in terms
of reducing examination time and enhancing accuracy,
this type of setup would be unrealistic in a real clini-
cal setting. More recently, Mirhosseini et al. proposed
an immersive CTC system which leverages the advan-
tages aﬀorded by VR to improve lesion detection [25],
while still relying on 2D interaction techniques. Sim-

ilarly, Randall et al. explored an immersive VR pro-
totype, obtaining promising feedback regarding overall
faster diagnosis [26]. However, none of these works focus
on camera travel, nor explore a camera travel technique
other than the Fly-Through.

3 Immersive Navigation of a 3D Virtual Colon

An interactive VR system was developed to assist 3D
immersive navigation of subject-speciﬁc colon models
enabling users to travel via Fly-Through, Fly-Over or
Elevator camera modes [14].

3.1 3D Data

A single CTC dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive
[27] was considered (subject ID CTC-3105759107 ). The
3D model was reconstructed using the image-based geo-
metric modelling pipeline that is composed by freeware
tools [28] (Figure 1).

The high contrast between luminal space (air: black)
and colon luminal surface (colon wall: light grey) facil-
itates 3D reconstruction (Figure 1(A)). Firstly, the 3D
colon structure is segmented using the active contours
method based on region competition (Figure 1(B-C)),
which depends on the intensity values estimated via a
global threshold ﬁlter (ITK-SNAP 3.6). Secondly, a 3-D
surface mesh of the segmented data is generated using
marching cubes. Thirdly, undesired mesh artifacts were
attenuated through a cycle of smoothing and decimat-
ing operations (ParaView 5.3.0) and exported into a
*.ply (ASCII) ﬁle. Finally, the mesh ﬁle was converted
to *.obj (Blender 2.78) and imported into Unity. To
compute the 3D centerline of the colon mesh, we used
the algorithm proposed by Tagliasacchi et al. [29] which
solves the 3D mesh skeletonization problem by resort-
ing on mean curvature ﬂow (Figure 1(D)).

ment: pressing the green arrow button the user moves for-
ward, while pressing the red arrow the user moves backwards.

3.2 Immersive Camera Travel Techniques

We considered three camera travel techniques which al-
lowed users to inspect the colon model and navigate in-
side the luminal space: Fly-Through, Fly-Over and Ele-
vator. All techniques follow a predeﬁned centerline, i.e.,
follow the same path and use the same input (touch-
pad) to indicate the direction of movement (forward or
backwards) at a constant speed (Figure 2).

Each technique diﬀers on how the user’s orientation
is represented within the virtual environment. Identical
to conventional CTC, the Fly-Through will make the
user feel inside a cave. In this technique, the virtual
camera follows the path without the need for users to
move their head. They can, however, move their heads
to see what is behind, below or above them. User ori-
entation follows the centerline’s direction (Figure 3(a)).
Diﬀerently from the traditional Fly-Over technique found
in the literature [12] there is no need to split the colon
in two halves and assign a virtual camera to each part.
In this case, the inspection of the colon’s walls is done
by users’ head movement. The camera will automati-
cally keep the perpendicular perspective in the eyes of
the users, while they can move their heads to analyze
their surroundings (Figure 3(b)). Finally, the Elevator
technique does not change camera orientation, in order
to match the user’s real orientation (Figure 3(c)). Ulti-
mately, this could reduce cybersickness during the VR
trip, at the cost of increasing users’ chances of losing
the sense of direction.

4 Evaluation

We compared three diﬀerent camera travel techniques
in order to investigate their potential eﬀects on eﬃ-
ciency and diagnosis accuracy during CTC navigation:
Fly-Over, Fly-Through and Elevator. We used both
quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess the ease of
use, usefulness, eﬃciency and eﬃcacy of each technique.
Eﬃciency was measured based on task completion time,

as eﬃcacy corresponded to the success rate, i.e. the per-
centage of speciﬁc marks that were correctly identiﬁed.
Questionnaires were used to assess the subjective feel-
ing of usefulness, ease of use and disorientation of all
three techniques, as well as cybersickness [30].

4.1 Apparatus

Our setup relies on the oﬀ-the-shelf HTC Vive device.
It consists of a binocular Head-Mounted Display, two
game controllers and a Lighthouse Tracking System
composed by two cameras with emitting pulsed infrared
lasers that track all 6 degrees-of-freedom of head and
handheld gear (Figure 4). The tracking system gener-
ates an acquisition volume that enables users to move
freely within a 4.5x4.5x2.5 m3 space. User tests were
performed on an Asus ROG G752VS Laptop with an
Intel®Core™ i7-6820HK Processor, 64GB RAM and
NVIDIA GeForce GTX1070. The VR prototype runs

at 60 frames per second. All the code was developed in
C# using the SteamVR Plugin and Unity game engine
(version 5.5.1f1).

4.2 Participants

Eighteen participants (13 male, 5 female) took part in
our study, with ages between 18 and 25 years old (Mean
= 21.94; Standard Deviation = 1.98). Most participants
had an engineering background, namely Computer Sci-
ence (38.89%) and Biomedical Engineering (27.78%).
Most reported no previous experience in VR (66.6%) or
to use such systems less than once a month (27.78%).
One user reported to have claustrophobia.

4.3 Methodology

Participants were asked to complete a demographic ques-
tionnaire to survey their personal proﬁle and previous
experience regarding VR and medical tools. This was
followed by performing a training task with the tech-
nique they were assigned, to familiarize themselves both
with the technique and the virtual environment. After
that, they performed the test task followed by a post-
test questionnaire to assess qualitative metrics. The
task consisted in ﬁnding speciﬁc marks, in the form of
orange capsules (Figure 5), which were placed in both
easy and hard to ﬁnd locations in the colon, to simulate
the visibility of real lesions. Users were oblivious to the
total amount of marks (20 marks per technique) spread
throughout the colon. Instead, they were asked to ﬁnd
as many as they could, until they felt they had found
them all. This procedure was repeated for all three tech-
niques, which were assigned according to a balanced
latin-squares arrangement to avoid learning eﬀects.

5 Results

In this section we present the results from our statistical
analysis to evaluate quantitative and qualitative mea-
sures regarding the three techniques tested. For task
completion time and success rate, a Shapiro-Wilk test
revealed the data was not normally distributed. We
thus applied a Friedman non-parametric test for multi-
ple comparisons and Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks post-hoc
tests with a Bonferroni correction, setting a signiﬁcance
level at p <= 0.017. Such tests were also applied to
Likert-scale data collected via questionnaires and cy-
bersickness scores.

There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the success rate
values depending on the camera travel technique used,
χ2(2) = 7.600, p = 0.022. Median (Interquartile Range)
values for success rate using the Fly-Through, Fly-Over
and Elevator techniques were 79.47 (26.25), 89.47 (18.42)
and 76.84 (36.77), respectively (Figure 6). Post-hoc anal-
ysis showed a statistically signiﬁcant increase of the suc-
cess rate between the Elevator and the Fly-Over tech-
nique (Z = −2.386, p = 0.017). However, there were
no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the Fly-
Through and Fly-Over techniques (Z = −2.345, p =
0.019), nor between the Fly-Through and the Elevator
(Z = −0.734, p = 0.463).

Over and Elevator.* indicates statistical signiﬁcance.

Fig. 7 Task Completion Time for each condition: Fly-
Through, Fly-Over and Elevator.* and ** indicate statistical
signiﬁcance.

Regarding task completion time, there were statis-
tically signiﬁcant diﬀerences depending on the cam-
era travel technique used, χ2(2) = 10.333, p = 0.006.
Mean (standard deviation) task completion time val-
ues for the Fly-Through, Fly-Over and Elevator tech-
niques were 273.91 (100.05), 305.53 (124.38) and 322.13
(135.49), respectively (Figure 7). Post-hoc analysis showed
statistically signiﬁcant decreases between Fly-Through
and Fly-Over (Z = −2.548, p = 0.011), as well as be-
tween the Fly-Through and the Elevator techniques
(Z = −2.548, p = 0.011). Still, there was no signiﬁ-
cant diﬀerence between the Fly-Over and the Elevator
(Z = −1.328, p = 0.184). We also did not ﬁnd signif-
icant diﬀerences between techniques regarding cyber-
sickness scores.

As for qualitative metrics (Table 1), we found sta-
tistical signiﬁcance in the perceived usefulness of the
navigation technique (Q1) (χ2(2) = 7.35 p = 0.025).
Notably, users found Fly-Through more useful than the
Fly-Over technique (Z = −2.588 p = 0.01). We also
found statistical signiﬁcance regarding the ease of un-
derstanding the direction of movement (Q2) (χ2(2) =
9.529 p = 0.009), but with no signiﬁcance between pairs
after performing a Bonferroni correction. Finally, re-
sults indicate statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in per-
ceived disorientation (χ2(2) = 11.111 p = 0.004). In
eﬀect, users felt less disoriented by the Fly-Through
technique when compared either to the Elevator (Z =
−2.541 p = 0.011) or the Fly-Over (Z = −2.634 p =
0.008) methods.

6 Discussion

Overall, Fly-Through has proven to be the best tech-
nique for immersive colonoscopy navigation in the user
tests we conducted. Indeed, we found it to be the most
eﬃcient option, according to task completion times, be-
sides being considered the most useful (Q1), easy to

use (Q2) and less disorienting (Q3) by the subjects.
Even though Fly-Over seemingly produced higher suc-
cess rates, there were no statistical diﬀerences that could
support its use over the Fly-Through, since the signiﬁ-
cant increase in task completion times would likely oﬀ-
set those gains. Additionally, users reported higher dis-
orientation while using the Fly-Over technique. Such
results may be attributed to the fact that Fly-Over had
subjects facing the colon’s walls most of the time. Ori-
enting the camera at a direction perpendicular to dis-
placement severely hampered their general perception
of the tubular structure of the colon and the path they
were following. This, combined with marks located be-
hind their backs, which forced subjects to inspect the
structure in several directions to try and ﬁnd them, ul-
timately caused their disorientation. Such results sug-
gest that the Fly-Over technique may be improved by
devising new means and interaction techniques for clin-
icians to visualize structures on their back without the
need to physically turn. By doing this they could com-
bine both the observed eﬀectiveness of the Fly-Over
technique with more eﬃcient means to support camera
travel in immersive CTC navigation. Finally, the Ele-
vator technique was the least favored option for navi-
gating the virtual environment. This may be due to the
search strategy adopted by most, which had to change
after each abrupt movement caused by the natural in-
ﬂexions of the colon structure. That may also explain
why this technique turned out to be the least eﬃcient
when compared to the other two approaches, as users
required more time to adapt and adjust their orienta-
tion whenever the camera direction changed.

Through is still the most eﬃcient and easy to use tech-
nique for immersive VR CTC. The Elevator technique
was found to be less eﬀective and eﬃcient than both
Fly-Through and Fly-Over methods, but less disorient-
ing than the Fly-Over approach. This can be explained
by the need to physically turn one’s body to eﬀectively
scan the colon structure in all directions. Still, this lim-
itation did not aﬀect task eﬀectiveness, as in the Fly-
Over technique users were able to achieve higher suc-
cess rates when ﬁnding speciﬁc marks along the colonic
structure. Thus, the Fly-Over would be the technique
of choice in order to provide a more accurate analy-
sis, and produce enhanced readings, as it helps people
to identify lesions even in diﬃcult-to-scan locations de-
spite being a more time-consuming procedure. Indeed
our experience suggests that each interaction technique
could be useful in its own right, Fly-Through being
most adequate to scan the colon in a quick preview,
while Fly-Over would likely enable more reliable and
comprehensive readings by clinicians.

Still, our study had two main limitations. First, our
experimental task only aims at reﬂecting the real clin-
ical task to a certain extent, i.e. limited lesion visibil-
ity caused by the anatomical properties of the colon,
while orange capsules may signiﬁcantly diﬀer from le-
sions such as polyps. Second, our participants had no
clinical background, which may impact the selection of
the ideal navigation technique to perform immersive
VR CTC analysis. Future work will include validating
such conclusions next to a group of medical profession-
als and the use of more generic ﬂying to be able to
generalize our results to a more broad area of cave-like
structures.
