1. INTRODUCTION 
Although  relevant  to  many  aspects  of  our  everyday  lives,  scientists  have  yet  to 
fully decipher the fundamental mechanisms of friction – that is, what occurs when 
two surfaces begin to slide against one another? Frictional slip is central to fields 
as  diverse  as  physics  (Baumberger  et  al.,  1999;  Ciliberto  and  Laroche,  1999; 
Filippov et al., 2004; Muser et al., 2001; Urbakh et al., 2004) tribology (Bowden 
and  Tabor,  2001;  Persson,  2000),  the  mechanics  of  earthquakes  (Andrews  and 
BenZion, 1997; Ben-Zion, 2001; Bouchon et al., 2001; Cochard and Rice, 2000; 
Dieterich and Kilgore, 1994; Heaton, 1990; Ohnaka and Shen, 1999; Rice et al., 
2001;  Scholz,  1998;  Xia  et  al.,  2004)  and  shear-driven  fracture  (Freund,  1979; 
Gao  et  al.,  2001;  Ravi-Chandar  et  al.,  2000;  Rosakis,  2002).  Beyond  their 
fundamental scientific interest, questions in the field of friction have relevance to 
the  issue  of  earthquake  measurement  and  predictions,  as  well  as  for  numerous 
industrial applications. 

In  1699  Guillaume  Amontons  gave  the  modern  formulation  of  the  static 
friction  laws.  In  1785 Charles-Augustin  de  Coulomb  added  the  first  formulation 
of dynamic friction laws and suggested a model that partially accounts for them. 
The  explanation  as to  why a  friction  coefficient exists and  is  independent  of  the 
(apparent)  contact  area  was  introduced  in  the  Micro  Contact  Interface  model 
(MCI)  of  Bowden  and  Tabor  (Bowden  and  Tabor,  2001)  in  the  1940's.  These 
authors were the first to note that, due to surface roughness, the real (net) area of 
contact  actually  consists  of  a  myriad  of  micro-contacts.  The  net  contact  area 
formed  by  these  micro-contacts  is  only  a  fraction  of  the  apparent  contact  area. 
Bowden  and  Tabor  noted  that  it  is  the  net  contact  which  is  responsible  for  the 
frictional force. The amount of net contact area formed is dependent on neither the 
surface  roughness  nor  geometry  of  the  bulk  material,  but  only  on  the  material's 
mechanical  properties  and  the  normal  load  applied.  When  two  surfaces  are 
brought into contact, their highest asperities touch first, and the load is carried by 
these  contact  points.  When  the  pressure  at  the  contact  points  is  larger  than  the 
microscopic yield stress of the material, these contact points flow together to form 
junctions  which  first  elastically  deform  to  increase  the  net  contact  area.  When, 
however, the pressure at a micro-contact approaches the material's yield stress, the 
net  contact  area will increase due  to both plastic deformation and  material flow. 
The resistance of these "welded" junctions to shear is the friction force. Here, we 

 
 
 
 
will present the results of direct measurements of the local net contact area along 
the entire interface in nearly “real” time. 

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
Before describing our results, we present, in this section, a detailed description of 
our  experimental  system.  Our  experiments  describe  the  dynamics  of  two  brittle 
PMMA  (Polymethylmethacrylate)  blocks  separated  by  a  rough  interface.  Each 
surface,  consisting  of  many  discrete  randomly  distributed  micro-contacts,  was 
artificially  roughened  to  an  approximate  roughness  of  up  to  2µm  (rms).  Slip  is 
initiated  by  loading  the  blocks  with  a  constant  normal  force  FN  while  slowly 
increasing the applied shear force, FS. We measure the dynamics of the interface 
by  means  of  real-time  visualization  of  the  net  contact  area  formed  by  the  rough 
interface between the two blocks. 

A schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is presented in Figure 1a. 
Two  PMMA  blocks,  a  slider  and  base,  are  placed  one  on  top  of  the  other.  The 
respective dimensions of the slider and base are 100-200 x 6 x 75 mm and of size 
300 x 27 x 30 mm, where we define X  as the direction of applied shear, Y  as the 
sample  thickness  and  Z  as  the  normal  loading  direction.  A  rough  interface  was 
formed  in  the  following  manner.  The  slider's  contact  face  was  first  diamond 
machined to a flatness of better than 0.05µm (rms) and then roughened to degrees 
of roughness which were varied between 0.05-5µm rms. The base block was first 
machined to within a 10µm flatness, and then hand-lapped to roughnesses which 
were varied to between 0.4-10µm rms. A non-machined, commercially flat (50nm 
rms) base was also used.  

Figure 1: (a) A schematic view of the experimental apparatus. A laser sheet is incident on a 
rough interface (inset) at an angle far beyond the angle for total internal reflection from the 
PMMA-air  interface.  Light  can  only  traverse  the  interface  at  either  the  actual  points  of 
contact or by tunneling across the interface. The transmitted light, imaged on a fast camera, 

 
 
is  therefore  a  direct  measure  of  the  net  contact  area  at  each  point.  (b)  For  an  interface 
formed by two rough materials the integrated intensity of light,  hence the  total net contact 
area, is proportional to the applied normal stress, FN. The data in the figure were obtained 
for  an  interface  whose  1µm  RMS  roughness  is  much  greater  than  the  50nm  tunneling 
distance at the 70° angle of incidence used. 

A normal load, FN, ranging from 1-5000N (1-10MPa depending on both FN and 
the surface area of the sample), was applied uniform in X and Y  to the slider. This 
was accomplished by coupling a stiff S-beam load cell, to which a point load was 
applied, to the slider via a soft “mattress”, consisting of an array of 40 soft springs 
with a total stiffness of 4 x 105 N/m. Although there was no feedback mechanism 
controlling  the  application  of  normal  load,  we  measured  FN  fluctuations  of  less 
than 2% during shear loading and overall sliding. 

The  shear  load,  FS,  which  was  varied  from  0-3  MPa,  was  applied  via  a 
stepping  motor  moving  in  discrete  steps  of  0.06µm  with  loading  rates  ranging 
from 1µm/sec to 10mm/sec. The stepper motor applied the shear stress to one side 
of an S-beam load cell of stiffness of 4 x 106 N/m. The opposite side of the load 
cell was attached to a 12mm diameter rod, which pressed against the trailing edge 
of the slider. Thus, shear was applied to the sample over an area whose center of 
mass was 6.5 mm above the interface. This introduced a small mechanical torque 
(2.6·10-3·FN N·m) in the loading which resulted in an initial 2.5% variation of FN 
over  the  length  of  the  interface.  Our  resolution  in  the  dynamic  measurement  of 
shear  was  limited  by  the  compliance  of  the  loading  system.  For  example,  the 
sharp 5-8%  decrease  of  FS  upon  the  onset  of  sliding was  accompanied  by  slight 
damped oscillations whose maximum amplitude was about 0.005FS and duration 
about 0.5ms. This limited our measurement accuracy for the trailing edge slip to 
about 2.5 µm. 

The  interface was illuminated by a 200 x 5mm laser sheet  (λ=660nm)  whose 
angle  of  incidence  (α)  was  much  larger  than  the  critical  angle  needed  for  total 
internal reflection (over 60º) from the acrylic-air interface. Since the cross-section 
of the laser sheet parallel to the interface plane is 200 x  5/cos(α), the laser sheet 
illuminated  the  entire  interface  6mm  wide.  The  intensity  of  both  the  transmitted 
and reflected light  as  a function of  space  and time was imaged by a fast CMOS 
sensor (VDS CMC1300 camera). The sensor can be configured to frame sizes of 
1280  x  N  pixels  with  frame  rates  of  500,000/(N+1)  frames/sec.  With  this  sensor 
we  were  able  to  visualize  the  instantaneous  net  contact  area  along  the  entire 
interface at rates of up to 4µsec per frame. For a 150 x 6 mm interface imaged at 
100,000 frames/sec (typical conditions in the experiments described below) each 
pixel  is  mapped  to  a  0.1  x  1.5  mm  section  of  the  interface,  where  the  higher 
resolution  is  in  the  propagation  direction.  Thus,  in  the  experiments  described 
below,  we  do  not  measure  the  contact  area  of  individual  micro-contacts  but, 

 
rather,  the  total  contact  area  of  the  relatively  large  (~  1500)  ensemble  of  micro-
contacts encompassed within each pixel. Individual micro-contact dynamics could 
be visualized with this method but, with the present 1280 pixel resolution of our 
sensors, at the expense of detecting the overall large-scale interface dynamics.   

For  the  experimental  conditions  used,  light  will  only  effectively  traverse  the 
interface, either at points of direct contact or by tunneling through the distance ‘h’ 
separating the two surfaces. When the interface is sufficiently rough, as in the  1µ 
RMS  typical  for  our  dynamic  experiments,  the  distance  separating  the  two 
surfaces  will  be  much  larger  than  the  exponential  decay  length  (d~50nm)  of  the 
evanescent light. As a result, the transmitted intensity, I(x,y), at each point along 
the  interface  is  proportional  to  the  net  contact  area  at  that  spatial  location.  This 
linearity  is  demonstrated  in  figure  1b,  where  the  spatially  integrated  transmitted 
intensity  is  shown  to  be  an  approximately  linear  function  of  the  applied  normal 
load. Thus, the total net contact area along the interface is a linear function of the 
applied  normal  stress,  providing  a  direct  validation  of  the  Bowden  and  Tabor 
picture  of  friction  (Bowden  and  Tabor,  2001;  Persson,  2000).    As  will  be 
described in detail in the next section, the slight curvature in evidence in Fig. 1b is 
due  to  small  tunneling  contributions  to  the  intensity  that occur  at  high  values  of 
FN. 

Data  acquisition  of  the  contact  area  was  performed  by  the  use  of  a  circular 
buffer  of  size  128MB  into  which  interface  visualization  data  was  continuously 
acquired.  Cessation  of  the  acquisition  was  triggered  at  a  preset  delay  from  the 
onset  of  sliding.  The  triggering  signal  was  obtained  by  means  of  an  acoustic 
sensor  coupled  to  the  leading  edge  of  the  slider.  In  this  way,  we  were  able  to 
acquire  contiguous  measurements  of  the  contact  area  over  the  time  interval  of 
250ms surrounding the onset of motion. 

3. CONTACT MODELS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE IMAGING METHOD 

Let  us  first  derive  the  Amontons-Coulomb  law  in  the  MCI  form  (Bowden  and 
Tabor, 2001). Two assumptions are made: 

and 

FN

Σ⋅= p

FS

Σ⋅= s

(1) 

(2) 

where FN, Σ, FS, p, s are, respectively, the normal load, real area of contact, peak 
tangential  strength,  penetration  hardness  (which  is  roughly  three  times  the  yield 
strength (Rabinowicz, 1995)) and shear strength respectively. Equation (1) states 
that the real area of contact is proportional to the load while in (2) the frictional 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
force  is  proportional  to  the  real  area  of  contact.    By  combining  (1)  and  (2)  we 
obtain the static friction coefficient, µs=s/p.    

Each  of  the  surfaces  in  contact  can  be  described,  in  principle,  by  its 
topography function Z(x,y), where Z is the height of the surface at the point (x,y). 
It has been argued (Archard, 1957; Greenwood and Williams, 1966) that, in order 
to treat friction, we can think of a surface as an ensemble of asperities of spherical 
shape with a given density, height distribution and radius distribution, designated 
as  n,  Φ(z)  and  F(ρ)  respectively.  Φ(z)  can  be  assumed  to  be  a  Gaussian 
distribution whose width, σ, is the roughness of the surface. F(ρ) is taken to be a 
delta  function  of  the  asperity  radius,  ρ.  This  constant  average  asperity  radius 
approximation  does  not  significantly  influence  the  results  of  the  following  MCI 
model (Buczkowski and Kleiber, 2000; Persson, 2000). Furthermore, it is possible 
to treat one surface as perfectly flat by adjusting the parameters used to describe 
the second surface. We follow this statistical approach and numerically generate a 
topography  function  Z(x,y)  having  a  constant  asperity  radius  ρ,  a  given  asperity 
, where σ1 
density, n and a Gaussian height distribution of width
and σ2 are the roughnesses of the two surfaces forming the interface. The values 
of these parameters where determined by surface scans performed with a contact 
profilometer  (Taylor  and  Hobson  Surftronix  3+),  and  verified  with  an  atomic 
force microscope. It should be noted that σ is measured to high accuracy, while ρ 
and n are only roughly evaluated from these surface scans. All of the calculations 
to  be  presented  are  performed  using  computer  generated  topography  functions. 
The results are independent of the specific surface generated.

In Equation 3, h is the distance between the mean of Z(x,y) and the flat opposing

the  surfaces,  otherwise  the  intensity  is  determined  by  the  amount  of  tunneling 
between the two surfaces.

area of the interface. By numerically inverting equations (5) and (6) we calculate 
the average distance, h, between the surfaces and use Eq (3) to compare the light 
intensity as a function of the applied load to the experiment. Circles in Figure 2 
present measurements of the light intensity passing through the interface as a 
function of the applied normal load for a well polished surface (50nm RMS). The 
dotted lines show the calculated transmitted intensities for the experimental 
conditions using Eq. (3) together with Eq. (5). The calculated curves were 
obtained by using the best fit values for the fully plastic (Eq 5) model. Two fitting 
parameters where used. The first parameter used was ρ⋅Y. The second parameter 
was a constant compensation necessary to account for the loss of light due to non 
evanescent scattering. The need for this correction is especially noticeable for 
smooth samples where, at low loads, the majority of the light is not transmitted at 
points of contact but scattered, since, at low loads, the contact size is much less 
than the 0.588µm  wavelength of the incident light. The values of n and  σ were 
obtained from the profilometer surface scan.

Figure  2:  Relative  light  intensity  transmitted  through  the  interface  as  a  function  of  the 
applied  load  for  smooth  samples.  Measured  values  (circles)  are  compared  to  values 
calculated using equations 3 and 5 (dashed line). (a)  PMMA on PMMA (b) PMMA on Glass 
In both (a) and (b) both sides of the interface had a 50nm rms roughness. 

The best fit of the plastic model (Fig. 2) to the measured light intensity yields an 
average  stress  of  150-400MPa  at  micro  contact  tips.  This  number  is  consistent 
with the measured penetration hardness strength by both Briscoe at al (Briscoe et 
al.,  1998)  and  Dietrich  at  (Dieterich  and  Kilgore,  1994)  al  for  similar  materials. 
There  is,  however  a  slight  but  systematic  deviation  between  measured  and 
calculated  intensities  in  Fig.  2.  We  interpret  these  slight  discrepancies  as  due  to 
elasto-plastic corrections (Kogut and Etsion, 2002; Kogut and Etsion, 2003) that 
should be made for the very smooth (50nm rms) surfaces used in Fig. 2.  

The  fully  elastic  model  (Eq  6)  was  also  tested  using  ρ  as  the  free 
parameter.  The  elastic  model  produces  highly  unrealistic  values  for  the  fitting 
parameters.  The  average asperity radius ρ~5nm is over two orders of magnitude 
lower  than  the  value  suggested  by  the  surface  scans,  and  the  average  stress  of 
10GPa at the micro contact tip is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the 
measured yield stress of PMMA. We thus conclude that, for this system, the pure 
plastic model of micro-contact tip distortion is the applicable one. 

The ratio of elastic to plastic deformation for a given material depends on 
the quantity ρ/σ, which is expected to decrease with surface roughness (Persson, 
2000). In figure 3 we present the measurements of the transmitted light intensity 
as a function of the applied load, for the considerably rougher interfaces formed 
by  two  PMMA  samples  with  a  500nm  rms  roughness.  Note  that,  for  these 
surfaces,  the  fully  plastic  model  provides  an  excellent  fit,  yielding  both  no 
noticeable systematic deviation and a value of ρ=0.2µm (Y was set to 200 MPa) 
in good agreement with the surface scans. 

For  rough  surfaces  (σ >> d),  as  presented  in  Fig.  1b,  a  linear  relation 
between transmitted light through the interface and normal stress is obtained. This 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relation  is  model-independent,  as  the  influence  of  the  different  contact  models 
comes in through the degree of tunneling that occurs across the interface, and in 
the rough interface limit tunneling through the interface is negligible. Thus, these 
conditions allow quantitative measurement of frictional properties of the interface 
without  the  need  for  any  assumptions  regarding  the  specific  deformation 
mechanism.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

4.1. Direct Measurements of the Net Contact Area 

Slip was initiated by increasing FS at a constant rate after setting a constant value 
of  FN.  The  dynamics  governing  the  block  detachment  process  (i.e.  interface 
rupture)  are  governed  by  well-defined  crack  like  fronts,  which  extend  in  the  Y 
direction  and  propagate  in  the  X  direction  along  the  interface.  We  use  dynamic 
measurements of I(x,y,t) to study these fronts.  

The  onset  of  slip  is  immediately  preceded  by  the  interplay  of  three 
different  types  of  coherent  crack-like  detachment  fronts;  fast  sub-Rayleigh  and 
intersonic  fronts,  both  of  which  have  been  previously  studied  (Rosakis  et  al., 
1999;  Xia  et  al.,  2004);  and  slow  fronts  (Rubinstein  et  al.,  2004)  These  fronts 
propagate across the interface (from the trailing to the leading edge), as shown in 
Figure  4a  and  Figure  4b.  We  define  these  fronts  as  “detachment  fronts”,  since 
they  precipitate  detachment  of  the  micro-contacts  which  form  the  interface.  Our 
measurements  are  not  sensitive  enough  to  determine  whether  local  Mode  I  type 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
conditions, yielding separation of the interface at the leading edge of these fronts, 
occurs.  Such  separation  may  occur  in  the  dynamics  of  slip  pulses  (Ben-Zion, 
2001; Bouissou et al., 1998). 

Behind a detachment front the net contact area is reduced, whereas ahead 
the contact area is unchanged. Detachment in our experiments is always initiated 
by  the  first  of  these  detachment  fronts,  the  “Sub-Rayleigh”  fronts,  which 
propagate  at  rapid  subsonic  velocities  up  to  and  including  the  Rayleigh  wave 
speed,  VR (VR=935m/s in  PMMA).  As  seen in  Fig.  4c  and  Fig.  4d,  sub-Rayleigh 
fronts lead to an approximate 10% decrease in the local contact area, immediately 
upon their passage. These fronts can be identified with earthquakes that propagate 
in the 0.2-0.8VR range. Upon detachment initiation, these fronts rapidly accelerate 
until  arriving  at  velocities  in  the  vicinity  of  VR.  At  this  point,  the  sub-Rayleigh 
fronts  suddenly  arrest  and  are replaced  by  two  additional  types  of  fronts,  which 
are simultaneously emitted.  

The  more  rapid  of  these  fronts  are  intersonic  fronts,  which  propagate  at 
speeds which are considerably higher than the shear wave velocity. These types of 
fronts have been observed in recent experiments (Rosakis et al., 1999; Xia et al., 
2004)  and  calculations  (Gao  et  al.,  2001;  Needleman,  1999)  of  explosively 
induced  shear  fracture.  There  is  also  evidence  for  such  fronts  in  the  seismic 
records (Bouchon et al., 2001) of recent earthquakes (e.g. Izmit, 1999). Although 
these  waves  traverse  the  entire  length  of  the  interface,  they give  rise  to  minimal 
(1-2%) detachment of the net contact area (figures 4c,d). The minimal detachment 
precipitated  by  these  fronts  makes  them  barely  discernable  in  our  direct 
measurements  of  net  contact  area  reduction,  as  shown  in  figure  4a.  Intersonic 
fronts  are,  however,  clearly  visible  when  the  temporal  derivative  of  the  contact 
area  at  each  location  along  the  interface  is  performed,  as demonstrated  in  figure 
4b.   

than  sub-Rayleigh 

 The second type of front, emitted upon arrest of the sub-Rayleigh fronts, 
is a new type of front, a “slow detachment front”. These fronts propagate one to 
two  orders  of  magnitude  more  slowly 
fronts.  Our 
measurements suggest that slow detachment fronts nearly always occur; either as 
isolated processes or in conjunction with the more rapid modes. These fronts are 
the  most efficient of the fronts for interface detachment, leading to about a 20% 
reduction  in  contact  area  upon  their  passage.  The  slow  fronts  also  cause  a 
significant amount of slip while in motion (over 25% of the overall slip before the 
onset  of  the  overall  motion  of  the  slider),  but  their  acoustic  signatures  are 
significantly weaker than those of the faster modes. In the experiment presented in 
Fig.  4a  these  slow  fronts  are  clearly  seen.  In  this  particular  experiment,  once 
initiated, the slow fronts traversed the entire interface. In many cases, however, a 
reverse transition from slow fronts back to sub-Rayleigh fronts occurs (Rubinstein 
et al., 2004), and the sub-Rayleigh fronts then conclude the interface detachment.  

 
Upon  the  initiation  of  sliding,  a  backward  propagating  front,  labeled  as  a 
“rebound  front”  in  figure  4b,  is  initiated.  These  fronts,  which  traverse  the  entire 
interface at intersonic velocities, are harbingers of the motion of the leading edge 
of the sample.

Figure 4: The dynamics of slip, prior to overall sliding, take place via the interplay between 4 
different  types  of  coherent  crack-like  fronts.  (a)  Each  horizontal  line  shown  is  the 
transmitted  intensity  I(x,t),  averaged  over  the  y  direction,  of  a  typical  experiment  as  a 
function of time. Successive lines spanning the 150mm long interface were acquired at 10µsec 
intervals.  These  intensity  measurements,  normalized  by  their  initial  values  at  each  spatial 
point,  are  color-coded  to  reflect  the  change  in  the  contact  area  at  each  spatial  point  as  a 
function  of  time.  Hot  (cold)  colors  reflect  increased  (decreased)  net  contact  area.  (b)  The 
temporal derivative, dI/dt, at  each  point x along  the interface  for  the data  presented  in  (a), 
color coded as above. 4 different types of fronts are labeled within the plot. The visibility of 
the fronts, which can also be seen in (a), is enhanced by the derivation.  (c) The relative drop 
in contact area, as indicated by the intensity drop (I-∆I)/I across each of the three forward-
propagating  fronts  shown  in  (a).  (d)  The  contact  area  reduction,  ∆I/I,  in  a  number  of 
different experiments for slow detachment fronts (squares), sub-Rayleigh fronts (circles) and 
intersonic  fronts  (diamonds)  as  a  function  of  their  measured  propagation  velocities.    Note 
both  the  large  differences  in  velocities  and  significant  differences  in  the  contact  area 
reductions of the different fronts. 

Let us now consider the overall relative motion of the base and slider. We 
define sliding as the combined motion of both the leading and trailing edges of the 
sample.  Interestingly,  sliding  does  not  occur  as  the  result  of  the  passage  of 
intersonic  fronts,  despite  the  fact  that  intersonic  fronts  are  seen  to  traverse  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
entire interface. Sliding is only initiated (Rubinstein et al., 2004) upon the arrival 
of  either  sub-Rayleigh  or  slow  detachment  fronts  at  the  leading  edge  of  the 
sample. Slip at the trailing edge of the sample is measured while these fronts are 
in  motion.  Until  their  arrival  at  the  leading  edge,  however,  the  base  and  slider 
remain effectively pinned and no measurable sliding takes place. 

Why  is  no  motion  at  either  the  leading  or  trailing  edges  initiated  by  the 
intersonic fronts? A possible explanation is that the intersonic fronts involve only 
a  small  sub-population  of  the  micro-contacts.  Thus,  upon  the  intersonic  front's 
passage, these "weak" micro-contacts are broken, whereas the larger population of 
stronger  micro-contacts  remains  intact.  This  picture  provides  an  explanation  for 
both the negligible amount of contact area freed by these fronts as well as the lack 
of overall motion precipitated by their passage.  

4b.Photoelastic Measurements 
The total internal reflection imaging method described above is very powerful in 
supplying real-time quantitative information about the net contact area. However, 
the  data  provided  by  these  measurements  are  limited  to  the  micron  thick  2D 
interface. In order to gain insight into the dynamic processes occurring within the 
elastic  bulk  above  the  interface,  we  conducted  additional  experiments  using  the 
photo-elastic set-up described schematically in figure 5a.  

Figure 5b shows a typical photo-elastic pattern visible at a slow frame rate 
of 1.93 KHz (256 Lines) illuminated with a pulse of 16µs duration.  PMMA is not 
an ideal material for photoelastic tests. Although birefringence can be induced in 
PMMA,  its  material  fringe  constant  is  almost  20  times  higher  than  polymers 
usually used in such tests (Ravi-Chandar et al., 2000; Rosakis et al., 1999; Xia et 
al., 2004). On top of this, our need for spatial resolution in the Z direction limits 
us  to  relatively  slow  frame  rates  with  our  present  visualization  equipment.  At 
these  slow  rates  and  long  exposure  times  we  are  unable  to  identify  rapidly 
changing individual fringes because of the smearing induced by these effects. The 
frame rates  are rapid  enough to capture  the dynamics of the slow fronts, but are 
not  adequate  for  detailed  visualization  of  the  sub-Rayleigh  or  intersonic  fronts. 
Higher frame rates (55,555 frame/sec) have limited resolution in Z (8 lines), but 
are  capable  of  capturing  some  of  the  dynamics  precipitated  by  the  more  rapid 
fronts. The qualitative data obtained by this method is indicative of the correlation 
between the dynamics at the interface plane and the stress distribution within the 
elastic body to which it is coupled. 

All 

three  fronts  of  detachment  are  observed 

the  photoelastic 
measurements taken in the near vicinity of the interface. Figure 5c shows an (x,t) 
plot  of  the  1D stress  pattern  during  the detachment  in  a  typical  experiment.  The 
stress is imaged 1mm above the interface (on the slider) at a frame rate of 55,555 

in 

 
 
 
frame/sec  with  a  16µs  illumination  interval.  Note  that,  unlike  the  contact  area 
measurements where the intersonic front was responsible only for a mild transient 
change  in  the  area  of  contact,  the  stress  change  caused  by  the  intersonic  front’s 
passage  is  clearly  visible  (especially  near  the  transition  point) and  the  change  in 
local  stress  fluctuations  induced  by  the  intersonic  front  persist  at  each  point,  x, 
until the arrival of the slow detachment front. Unlike the work performed in other 
recent  experiments  (Ravi-Chandar  et  al.,  2000;  Rosakis  et  al.,  1999;  Xia  et  al., 
2004), we have neither the temporal nor spatial resolution to resolve the detailed 
dynamics  of  the  faster  fronts  by  means  of  photo-elastic  measurements.  These 
measurements  do  establish,  however,  that  the  contact  area  measurements 
presented  above  are  indeed  complementary  to  previous  observations  of  rapid 
fronts (Rosakis et al., 1999; Xia et al., 2004). Furthermore, the slow fronts, which 
have  not  been  previously  observed  by  photo-elastic  methods,  are  easily 
observable  when  visualization  is  performed  over  sufficiently  long  temporal 
intervals.

5. Conclusions 

The  dynamics  of  friction  have,  traditionally,  been  considered  to  be 
governed by processes that occur at slow time scales, when the entire slider is in 
motion. We have studied the detailed processes that occur at the interface between 
two  blocks  of  like  material,  during  normal  loading  and  immediately  prior  to  the 
onset of frictional sliding. We first demonstrated how the nominal area of contact 
at  an  interface  can  be  measured  and  imaged.  We  showed  that  the  real  area  of 
contact  is  proportional  to  the  normal  load  and  we  demonstrated  that  the 
deformation of the asperities in this material is mainly plastic.  

When  sufficient  shear  force  is  applied  to  the  system,  the  detachment 
process,  in  which  extremely  short  time  scales  are  dominant,  takes  place  via  the 
interplay  of  3  different  types  of  detachment  fronts  that  propagate  along  the 
interface. We showed that slow detachment fronts, that travel at a speeds one to 
two orders of magnitude below the shear speed of the material, determine the over 
all time scale of the detachment process. This time scale is relevant to issues such 
as the initiation of healing and aging of an interface.   

No overall sliding of the two blocks occurs until either of the slower two 
modes traverses the entire interface. The onset of sliding, which is initiated by the 
detachment  fronts  described  above,  is  the  transition  from  static  to  dynamic 
friction.  The  10-20%  reduction  in  the  static  coefficient  of  friction  for  PMMA  is 
consistent with the overall 12% average reduction in the net contact area that we 
observe  prior  to  the  onset  of  sliding.    Thus,  this  work  elucidates  both  the 
mechanisms responsible for the transition from static to dynamic friction as well 
as possible key processes that take place in dynamics of fault nucleation. 

Although entirely reproducible, our quantitative results have been obtained 
solely for PMMA on PMMA and PMMA on glass interfaces. A relevant question 
is  that  of  the  generality  of  the  observed  phenomena.  Both  the  sub-Rayleigh  and 
intersonic  fronts  have  been  observed  in  a  series  of  recent  experiments,  in  which 
Mode II fracture was studied along weak interfaces (Coker et al., 2005). In these 
experiments,  which  were  also  performed  on  brittle  polymers,  entirely  different 
loading  configurations,  sample  sizes  and  geometries  were  used.  The  results  of 
these  experiments  consistently  demonstrated  the  existence  of  both  sub-Rayleigh 
and  intersonic  fronts.  These  fronts  were  also  observed  in  both  finite  element 
(Needleman,  1999)  and  molecular  dynamic  (Abraham,  2003;  Gao  et  al., 
2001)simulations which were motivated by these intriguing experimental results.  
In  more  recent  experiments  by  Xia  et  al  (Xia  et  al.,  2004),  the  transition 
from  sub-Rayleigh  to  intersonic  fracture  was  studied  in  detail.  Cracks,  moving 

 
 
 
 
along a weak interface, were observed to propagate at the Rayleigh wave speed, 
VR,  until  the  shear  stress  at  the  shear  wave  front  (traveling  ahead  of  the  main 
rupture)  becomes  high  enough  and  allows  the  creation  of  a  secondary  daughter 
crack  traveling  at  intersonic  speeds.  The  transitioning  to  intersonic  occurs  at  an 
FN-dependent  critical  length.  This  transition  process  and  dependence  of  the 
critical  length  on  FN  is  consistent  with  a  modification  (Xia  et  al.,  2004)  to  the 
Burridge-Andrews  model  (Andrews,  1976).  Our  experiments  yielded  no 
systematic  dependence  of  the  transition  length  with  normal  stress.  Instead,  we 
observed  that  the  generation  of  intersonic  fronts  (together  with  slow  fronts)  was 
triggered  when  a  sub-Rayleigh  front  reached  approximately  VR.  This  apparent 
contradiction  may  be  understood  in  the  following  way.  A  condition  of  the 
Burridge-Andrews mechanism for the transition to intersonic fronts is that, when 
the transition occurs, the initial front is propagating at the Rayleigh wave speed. 
The  loading  conditions  in  [(Xia  et  al.,  2004)]  indeed  produced  fronts  which, 
within  a few  millimeters,  attained  VR.  In  our  experiments,  the  acceleration  to  VR 
was  much  less  rapid,  and  this  condition  was  not  met  until,  in  general,  the  sub-
Rayleigh fronts were beyond the transition lengths measured in Xia et al's work. 
The  transition  to  intersonic  fronts  at  approximately  VR  in  our  experiments  may 
then  simply  reflect  the  fact  that  our  fronts  were  already  beyond  the  transition 
length at the time when VR was attained.  

Additional  important  differences  between  the  two  experiments  are  in  the 
loading configurations and initial conditions. In our experiments a constant value 
of  FN  is  first  imposed.  Shear  stress  is  then  adiabatically  increased  until  the 
transition  to  sliding  (which  is  mediated  by  the  detachment  fronts)  occurs.  Under 
these  conditions,  our  experiments  are  always  conducted  slightly  above  the  shear 
stress needed to overcome static friction. In the Xia et al. experiments, the system 
was always stable to sliding. These experiments were always conducted for stress 
levels  that  were  below  those  needed  to  overcome  static  friction,  but  above  the 
stress levels needed to maintain dynamic friction. Motion was triggered in the Xia 
et  al.  experiments  by  the  plasma-induced  pressure  caused  by  exploding  a  wire 
imbedded  within  the  interface.  This  is  not  a  small  perturbation,  and  its  effect  is 
decidedly  nonlocal.  The  rupture  fronts  along  the  interface  were  triggered  by  the 
propagating  shear  wave  generated  by  the  explosion.  We  surmise  that  the  shear 
wave was necessary to induce the initial motion along the interface, which locally 
"boosted" the system beyond the static friction threshold. This initial motion then 
could  evolve  into  an  intersonic  rupture.  As  this  perturbation  propagated  at  the 
shear  wave  velocity,  intersonic  rupture  was,  necessarily,  initiated  ahead  of  the 
sub-Rayleigh fronts. As in the two experiments, both the initial perturbations and 
loading conditions were so cardinally different, it is not entirely surprising that the 
transition  mechanisms  between  sub-Rayleigh  and  intersonic  fronts  would  be 
substantially different.  

The dissimilarities in the dynamic interplay between the sub-Rayleigh and 
intersonic  fronts  are,  perhaps,  related  to  the  differences  in  the  triggering  and 
loading  conditions  in  the  two  experiments.  In  the  Xia  et  al.  experiments,  sub-
Rayleigh  and  intersonic  fronts  were  observed  to  simultaneously  propagate  along 
the  interface,  with  the  initiation  of  the  intersonic  fronts  occurring  at  a  finite 
distance  ahead  of  the  sub-Rayleigh  front.    In  our  experiments,  intersonic  fronts 
were only generated upon arrest of the sub-Rayleigh fronts and, to our resolution, 
were initiated at the point of arrest. As the Burridge-Andrews mechanism predicts 
simultaneous  propagation  of  both  types  of  front,  this  observation  provides 
additional  evidence  that  this  mechanism  may  not  be  the  relevant  one  in  our 
experiments.   

The  character  of  the  intersonic  waves  in  both  experiments  also  appears 
quite  different.  Whereas  the  experiments  in  (Coker  et  al.,  2003;  Rosakis  et  al., 
1999; Xia et al., 2004) indicate that finite displacement of the interface occurs in 
the  wake  of  the  intersonic  fronts,  in  our  experiments  the  amount  of  slip 
displacement  generated  by  the  intersonic  fronts  is  negligible.  The  negligible 
contact  area  reduction  precipitated  by  intersonic  fronts  was  the  basis  for  our 
hypothesis  that  only  a  small  sub-population  of  the  asperities  takes  part  in  their 
motion. This hypothesis could also explain their lack of slip displacement in our 
experiments,  as  the  "unbroken"  asperities  surrounding  those  ruptured  by  the 
intersonic front would still pin the interface, allow only negligible slip.  

Slow  fronts  were  not  reported  in  the  previously  described  experiments 
(Coker et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2004), although both sub-Rayleigh and intersonic 
fronts were readily observed. The reason for this is probably due to the time scales 
involved. As the high-speed photography used in this previous work had a 50µs 
maximal  duration,  the  ~1mm  that  slow  fronts  would  have  traveled  within  this 
interval would have been nearly undetectable. Given the sound speeds of PMMA 
(Vp=2000m/s,  Vs=1000m/s)  and  the  geometry  of  our  experimental  configuration, 
reflected waves could play a role in  the dynamics of the slow fronts, since time 
scales  are  certainly  long  enough  for  acoustic  waves  to  traverse  the  sample 
numerous times. It is also conceivable that reflected stress waves could affect the 
dynamics of the fast fronts. Both of these issues require further study. 

There is, however, support for the generality of the slow fronts from two 
other  sources;  experiments  performed  by  Ohnaka  (Ohnaka,  2003;  Ohnaka  and 
Shen, 1999) on granite-granite interfaces and evidence obtained from the study of 
earthquakes. Ohnaka, using a discrete array of sensors distributed along a granite 
interface,  reported  evidence  of  coherent  disturbances  moving  along  the  interface 
at  much  slower  velocities  than  VR.  Interpreted  as  “nucleation  zones”,  these 
disturbances  preceded  rapid  sub-Rayleigh  propagation  and  their  propagation 
velocity  was  dependent  on  the  interface  roughness.  For  roughness  values 

comparable  to  our  experiments,  these  nucleation  zones  expanded  at  scaled 
velocities (~0.01VR) comparable to those that we obtain for slow fronts in PMMA. 
Further support for the existence of slow fronts in nature is given by recent 
reports  in  the  earthquake  literature  of  “slow”  or  “silent”  earthquakes.  These 
observations  (Crescentini  et  al.,  1999;  Linde  and  Sacks,  2002;  Rogers  and 
Dragert,  2003)  demonstrated  the  existence  of  events  in  which  significant  slip 
occurred,  but  with  a  minimal  acoustic  signature.  These  events  propagated  at 
velocities  significantly  slower  than  VR    for  hundreds  of  kilometers.  Such  slow 
events also accompanied (Ammon et al., 2005; Bilham, 2005; Lay et al., 2005) the 
recent  Sumatra-Andaman  earthquake  of  magnitude  9.3.  Both  analysis  and 
measurements  of  the  slip  in  this  massive  earthquake  indicated  that  an  a-seismic 
slow  front  propagated  at  approximately  300m/s  (less  than  0.1VR)  for  nearly  an 
hour in the northern section of the rupture and accounted for about 1/3 of the total 
slip in this devastating event.  

As this series of experiments appears to successfully model the rapid sub-
Rayleigh  and  intersonic  events  that  are  associated  with  earthquakes,  it  is 
conceivable that the slow fronts may indeed be analogs of these recently observed 
“silent”  earthquakes.  Little  is  currently  known  about  such  slow  earthquakes,  but 
evidence  is  mounting  that  these  events  may  be  much  more  common  than  was 
originally perceived.  In our experiments slow fronts are nearly always observed. 
Simulations(Ben-Zion  and  Andrews,  1998;  Lapusta  and  Rice,  2003;  Lapusta  et 
al., 2000) of earthquake nucleation suggest that slow nucleation fronts occur in the 
initial  period  of  earthquake  formation.  If  slow  detachment  fronts  are  indeed 
analogous to this type of earthquake-generated motion, it may be possible to gain 
significant insight into these important but elusive events by modeling them in the 
laboratory.
