ABSTRACT
We present a detailed study of the faint Milky Way satellite Draco II (Dra II) from
deep CFHT/MegaCam broadband g and i photometry and narrow-band metallicity-
sensitive CaHK observations, along with follow-up Keck II/DEIMOS multi-object
spectroscopy. Forward modeling of the deep photometry allows us to reﬁne the
structural and photometric properties of Dra II: the distribution of stars in colour-

metallicity-sensitive CaHK Pristine photometry conﬁrms this very low metallicity
([Fe/H] =
0.1 dex). Even though our study beneﬁts from a doubling of the
spectroscopic sample size compared to previous investigations, the velocity disper-
sion of the system is still only marginally resolved (σvr < 5.9 km s−1 at the 95 per
cent conﬁdence level) and conﬁrms that Dra II is a dynamically cold stellar system

1 INTRODUCTION

During the last decades,
important photometric surveys
such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York et al. 2000,
SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope And Rapid Re-
sponse System, Pan-STARRS1 (Chambers et al. 2016, PS1),
or the Dark Energy Survey (The Dark Energy Survey Col-
laboration 2005, DES) have led to the discovery of dozens of
Milky Way satellites. Some of these systems are extremely
faint (e.g., Belokurov et al. 2007; Bechtol et al. 2015; Drlica-
Wagner et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2015; Koposov et al. 2015b;
Laevens et al. 2015; Martin et al. 2015), but studying them
is important in order to better constrain the low-mass end of
the galaxy mass function (Koposov et al. 2009). Moreover,
systems conﬁrmed to be dwarf galaxies are thought to be
among the most dark matter dominated systems in the uni-
verse, potentially making them one of the best locations to
test the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (e.g., Bullock
& Boylan-Kolchin 2017).

However, the distinction between dwarf galaxies and
globular clusters can be challenging (e.g. Willman & Strader
2012; Laevens et al. 2014) yet crucial. In the ΛCDM model,
dwarf galaxies are located in massive dark matter halos.
Thus, they have deep potential wells that can leave a trail
of indirect observational evidence. For instance, they are
more extended for a given luminosity, which explains the
low surface-brightness nature of those systems and why deep
photometric surveys were needed to reveal their existence.
Dwarf galaxies are overall dynamically hot (i.e. their ve-
locity dispersion is larger than that implied by the mass
stored in their baryons alone, Martin et al. e.g., 2007; Si-
mon & Geha e.g., 2007), thus implying the presence of a
much higher mass than can be estimated from their stars
alone, while the typical velocity dispersion for faint clusters
is of order tenths of km s−1. Dwarf galaxies also share a few
chemical properties: they are overall more metal-poor than
old globular clusters with the same luminosity, and show
evidence of a large metallicity spread, which indicates that
the system has undergone chemical enrichment (Willman &
Strader 2012; Kirby et al. 2013). This is a strong indirect ev-
idence for the presence of a dark matter halo as the deeper
potential well of dwarf galaxies allows them to retain their
gas more eﬃciently against supernovae winds and shields
them against reionization, therefore allowing for the forma-
tion of successive stellar populations through time, despite
early star formation truncation (e.g., Brown et al. 2014). On
the contrary, most Milky Way globular clusters show very
low metallicity dispersion with σ[Fe/H] < 0.1 (Willman &
Strader 2012 and references therein). The few clusters with
signiﬁcant enrichment, such as ω Cen, are massive systems
and even thought to be dwarf galaxy remnants (Bellazzini
et al. 2008; Carretta et al. 2010).

As the detection of fainter satellites enabled by deeper
and deeper surveys continues, the line between dwarf galax-
ies and globular clusters becomes blurred. For this reason,
dwarf galaxy candidates have to be studied thoroughly:
deep observations in both photometry and spectroscopy are
needed to constrain the main chemical and structural prop-
erties of a given system.

Draco II (Dra II) is a Milky Way satellite discovered
by Laevens et al. (2015) in the Pan-STARRS1 3π survey.
At the time of its discovery, the satellite was found to be

compact (half-light radius rh = 19+8
−6 pc). Martin et al.
(2016a) carried out the spectroscopic follow-up of Dra II
and inferred a marginally resolved velocity dispersion of
σvr = 2.9 ± 2.1 km s−1. Visual comparison of spectra of
the few brightest Dra II member stars suggested that the
satellite could be metal poor ([Fe/H] < −2.1) and could ex-
hibit a metallicity spread. Martin et al. (2016a) tentatively
favoured Dra II being a dwarf galaxy, but pointed out that
the velocity dispersion of the system is only marginally re-
solved. Furthermore, no bright giant stars (g < 19) were
identiﬁed as Dra II members, making the estimate of the
chemical properties of the satellite challenging. Due to the
particular faintness of the satellite, and the small number
of bright members, kinematic evidence for a DM halo was
limited.

In this work, we reanalyze Dra II and present a de-
tailed study of its properties based on deep photometric
observations obtained with the Megacam wide-ﬁeld imager
on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT, Boulade
et al. 2003) and Keck II/DEIMOS spectroscopy (Faber et al.
2003) that complements the sample of Martin et al. (2016a).
In particular, we include here novel narrow-band photom-
etry that focuses on the metallicity-sensitive CaHK dou-
blet. We use these observations, which are part of a speciﬁc
dwarf-galaxy programme within the larger Pristine survey
(Starkenburg et al. 2017), to identify the metal-poor Dra II
stars and estimate the metallicity and metallicity dispersion
of the system.

The paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 describes
the observations and data of both our photometry and spec-
troscopy; Section 3 focuses on the analysis of the deep broad-
band g and i photometry to infer the structural and pho-
tometric properties of Dra II; Section 4 speciﬁcally centers
on the study of the narrow-band CaHK observations to de-
rive the metallicity and metallicity dispersion of the system;
and Section 5 revises the multi-object spectroscopic study
of Dra II. The paper concludes with a discussion and con-
clusions in Section 6.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA

2.1 Photometry

The photometry used in this paper was observed with the
wide-ﬁeld imager MegaCam on CFHT. It consists of deep,
broadband observations with gMC (487 nm) and iMC (770
nm) Megacam ﬁlters and narrow-band observations with the
new narrow-band CaHK Pristine ﬁlter that focuses on the
metallicity-sensitive Calcium H&K lines. This is the same
ﬁlter that is used by the Pristine survey (Starkenburg et al.
2017) to build a metallicity map of the Milky Way halo and
search for the most metal-poor stars in the Galaxy. The data
for Dra II, which were observed before the oﬃcial start of
the Pristine survey, are now folded into a dedicated eﬀort
by the Pristine collaboration to observe all northern, faint
Milky-Way dwarf galaxies or dwarf-galaxy candidates with
this ﬁlter (the Pristine dwarf-galaxy survey).

Observations were conducted in service mode by the
CFHT staﬀ during the night of April 5th, 2016 during con-
ditions of good seeing (∼ 0.5–0.7(cid:48)(cid:48)). Multiple sub-exposures
were observed in each band to better address CCD defects

and facilitate cosmic ray removal. Exposure times amounted
to 3 × 700 s, 5 × 500 s, and 3 × 705 s in the gMC, iMC, and
CaHK bands, respectively. After retrieval from the CFHT
archive, the images are processed with a version of the Cam-
bridge Astronomical Survey Unit pipeline (Irwin & Lewis
2001), which is speciﬁcally tailored to MegaCam data. We
refer the reader to Ibata et al. (2014) for more details. The
astrometric solution is derived using the catalogue of Pan-
STARRS1 stars (PS1; Chambers et al. 2016) that are located
in the ﬁeld and have uncertainties on the gP1 PS1 photome-
try lower than 0.1 mag. The astrometric solution is good at
the ∼ 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) level.

MegaCam gMC and iMC bands are then transformed
onto the PS1 photometric system by using the PS1 gP1 and
iP1 catalogs. Unsaturated MegaCam point sources are cross
identiﬁed with PS1 sources having photometric uncertainties
below 0.05 mag. To derive the colour equations between the
instrumental and PS1 magnitudes, we performed a second-
order polynomial ﬁt. We ﬁnd

polynomials coeﬃcients are propagated into the photometric
uncertainties. For clarity, we drop the P1 subscripts in the
rest of the text.

0 = −0.0235 ± 0.0019, ai

The narrow-band CaHK photometry is processed fol-
lowing the treatment presented in the paper describing the
Pristine survey and includes speciﬁc calibration steps to deal
with variations in the photometry as a function of the po-
sition in the ﬁeld of view (Starkenburg et al. 2017). The
Pristine model that translates (CaHK, g, i) into [Fe/H] is
recalculated for the PS1 photometric system and applied to
the Draco II photometry.

All MegaCam magnitudes are dereddened following
Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998) and using the extinc-
tion coeﬃcients from Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011), but it is
worth noting that Dra II is located in a low extinction area
of the sky, with a median E(B − V ) of 0.018 mag. We rely
on the CASU ﬂags to isolate point sources. The MegaCam
photometry are deeper than the original PS1 photometry
that enabled the discovery of Dra II but this means that
the MegaCam data saturate for magnitudes brighter than
i ∼ 17.7. For this reason, we complement the MegaCam data
set with the PS1 photometry for magnitudes brighter than
this limit. Finally, we clean the sample from stars for which
the information on either of the two broadbands is miss-
ing, we discard stars with photometric uncertainties larger
than 0.2 mag in either of the two bands, and we further
discard faint sources with g < 24.5. This latter cut removes
regions of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) for which
the star/galaxy separation becomes ineﬃcient and the data
are contaminated by a large number of background compact
galaxies.

The ﬁnal photometric sample comprises 12,638 stars
with broadband photometry, out of which 3,238 also have
good quality CaHK magnitudes. The spacial distribution
of a fraction of this sample, composed only of Dra II-like

stars, is shown in the left panel of Figure 1, where the sys-
tem is clearly visible as a compact stellar overdensity.

2.2 Spectroscopy

Dra II was observed during two diﬀerent runs using the
Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph
(DEIMOS) in multi-object spectroscopy mode: a ﬁrst mask
was observed in 2015 and was the focus of the study pre-
sented by Martin et al. (2016a) whilst the second run was
observed a year later on September 4th, 2016. We used our
group’s standard set-up for these observations, employing
the OG550 ﬁlter, the 1200 lines mm−1 grating and a central

wavelength of 7800

◦
A. This results in a FWHM resolution

at our central wavelength of ∼ 1.3

◦
A, and covers a wave-

length range of ∼ 6500 − 9000

◦
A. Such a setup allows us to
◦
well-resolve the Ca II triplet lines at ∼ 8500
A. These strong
absorption features are used to measure the line-of-sight ve-
locities of our observed stars. The mask was observed for 1
hour, split into 3 × 1200 seconds exposures.

Stars were selected for targeting using the colour-
magnitude diagram for Dra II and they were given a pri-
ority for observation based on their distance from a ﬁdu-
cial isochrone, which highlighted the main sequence turn-oﬀ
(MSTO), sub-giant and red giant branch of Dra II. We then
designed a slitmask using the IRAF DSIMULATOR soft-
ware package provided by Keck Observatories. In total, 96
stars were selected for observation, and 73 of these targets
returned spectra of suﬃciently high S/N such that a velocity
could be measured using the pipeline detailed in Ibata et al.
(2011) and Martin et al. (2016a). All stars with a signal-
over-noise ratio below 3.0 or a velocity uncertainty greater
than 15 km s−1 were ﬁnally discarded. Heliocentric veloc-
ities and equivalent widths from stars observed twice are
transformed into one single measurement by computing the
weighted mean and uncertainties from the two independent
velocity measurements. We do not investigate the potential
binarity of Dra II stars in great detail as the low signal-
over-noise of the spectra translate into typical velocity un-
certainties in the range 5-15 km s−1, which can make the de-
tection of any variability challenging. Martin et al. (2016a)
presented a spectroscopic study of Dra II using the 2015
dataset, however, the heliocentric velocities of the 2015 stars
in this work are slightly diﬀerent: using the usual method
of the Ibata et al. (2011) pipeline to derive the velocities,
the average diﬀerence of the 2015 and 2016 velocities is not
0 km s−1 as expected, but is shifted of a few km s−1. These
eﬀects appear when the velocities are derived through a non-
ﬂexible, but supposedly more precise method in the pipeline
of Ibata et al. (2011), that was used in the paper of Martin
et al. (2016a). In this work, using a slightly less precise, but
more ﬂexible method of the same pipeline to extract the
velocities, we are able to get rid of these systematics and
ﬁnd the expected mean diﬀerence in velocities for all stars
observed twice of 0 km s−1.

(2rh, see below) is presented in Figure 2 (left panel). For

based on the favoured model found in section 3. Right panel: Magniﬁed view of the central region.

Figure 2. Left panel: CMD of stars within two half-light radii (rh ∼ 3.0(cid:48)) of the Dra II centroid. The main sequence of Dra II clearly
stands out and points towards an old and metal-poor stellar population. The satellite seems to have very few, if any, giant stars. The
photometric uncertainties in the g band and g − i colour are shown every magnitude on the left of each panel. Middle panel: The
ﬁeld CMD obtained within a similarly sized region ∼ 25 arcminutes away from Dra II centroid. Right panel: CMD of all stars in the
photometric dataset, colour-coded according to the CaHK photometric uncertainties. Stars coloured in grey have CaHK uncertainties
above 0.2. The CaHK is clearly shallower than the broadband g and i photometry. Finally, the mask selecting only Dra II-like stellar
population is shown in solid, dark-grey line.

comparison, the CMD of a ﬁeld region of the same cov-
erage but selected in the outskirts of the MegaCam ﬁeld
of view is shown in the middle-left panel. The main se-
quence observed in the Dra II CMD is consistent with an old
and metal-poor stellar population (see below) as originally

pointed out by Laevens et al. (2015), but the MegaCam
data is much deeper and traces the main sequence of the
system more than three magnitudes below the turnoﬀ. The
exquisite MegaCam CMD is highlighted by the narrowness
of this sequence. The 50 per cent completeness of the data

in the g band is reached at g = 25.2 mag and i = 23.9 mag.
We conﬁrm that the main sequence of Dra II contains very
few stars brighter than the turnoﬀ and that the satellite is
particularly faint. Anticipating on the spectroscopic analysis
presented below, the right panel of Figure 15 highlights stars
with radial velocity measurements. Likely Dra II members
appear in red with vr ∼ −345 km s−1. With these velocities,
it is possible to isolate a handful of potential Dra II stars
just above the turnoﬀ. We ﬁnd no bright RGB stars and no
horizontal branch stars in the system.

3.1 Structural and CMD analysis

We take advantage of the deep MegaCam data and of the
better sampling of the system to revisit the structural analy-
sis performed by Laevens et al. (2015). The analysis is based
heavily on the algorithm presented in Martin, de Jong & Rix
(2008) and Martin et al. (2016b) and we separately infer the
CMD-properties of Dra II. Altogether, we aim to estimate
the structural properties of the system (the coordinate oﬀ-
sets of the centroid from the literature values, X0 and Y0,
the half-light radius along the major axis, rh, the elliptic-
ity1, (cid:15), the position angle of the major axis east of north,
θ, and the number of stars within the MegaCam data, N ∗),
along with its distance modulus m − M , Age A, metallicity
[Fe/H]CMD, and abundance in α elements [α/Fe].

sp

CM D

≡ {Xk, Yk} and (cid:126)dk

For any star k in our sample, the pieces of information
used at this stage are the coordinates of the star Xk and
Yk, projected on the sky on the plane tangent to Dra II’s
centroid, and the MegaCam magnitudes, gk and ik. For
clarity, we deﬁne (cid:126)dk
≡ {gk, ik}.
The suite of parameters we aim to infer is divided into a
set of structural parameters Psp ≡ {X0, Y0, rh, (cid:15), θ, N ∗, ηsp}
and a set of CMD-related parameters, PCMD ≡ {m −
M, A, [Fe/H]CMD, [α/F e], ηCMD}, with ηsp and ηCMD the
fractions of Dra II stars in the spacial and CMD data sets.
Following these deﬁnitions and keeping in mind that any
star could be a Dra II star or a ﬁeld star that belongs to
the Milky-Way contamination, we can express the spacial
likelihood of star k as

sp ( (cid:126)dk,sp|Psp) = ηsp(cid:96)DraII

We follow Martin et al. (2016b) and assume that Dra II
stars follow an exponential radial density proﬁle whereas
the ﬁeld contamination is taken to be ﬂat over the Mega-
Cam ﬁeld of view. However, and contrary to Martin et al.
(2016b), we assume N ∗ is a parameter to be determined by
the normalization. For this reason, the formalism is slightly
diﬀerent here. The radial density proﬁle of the system is
expressed as

To build the CMD models, we rely on a set of isochrones
for Dra II and build an empirical model for the ﬁeld contam-
ination. We base our CMD model of Dra II, (cid:96)DraII
CMD, on a set
of Dartmouth isochrones and luminosity functions2 (Dot-
ter et al. 2008) calculated for the PS1 photometric system.
For a given set of CMD parameters PCMD, we download the
isochrone and luminosity function (LF) of the stellar popula-
tion of this age A, metallicity [Fe/H]CMD, and α abundance
[α/Fe], and shift it by the distance modulus m−M . Since the
isochrones and LFs provided by the Darmouth library are
not continuous but discrete tracks, they are linearly splined.
The isochrones are then weighted according to their associ-
ated LF. At this stage, each isochrone is a continuous track
in CMD space with a ‘height’ equal to the luminosity func-
tion along it. We then generate a CMD PDF of where the
system stars are likely to be located by simply convolving
this track with the photometric uncertainties. With this for-
malism, we implicitly assume that Dra II contains a single
stellar population and any intrinsic spread in the properties
of the system will generate wider posterior PDFs. However,
as isochrones pile up towards the blue in the metal-poor
end regime ([Fe/H] < −1.4), only signiﬁcant metallicity or
age gradients would aﬀect our results. Finally, the colour-
magnitude space over which the PDF is calculated is im-
plemented with pixel sizes of 0.01 magnitude on the side,
so we further convolve the resulting PDF by a Gaussian of
dispersion 0.01 mag to avoid aliasing issues in our represen-
tation of the PDF. Since this PDF is supposed to describe
the observed Dra II features of the CMD, the completeness
of the data needs to be taken into account, therefore, each
track is weighted by the product of the completenesses in g0
and i0. This completeness is computed following the model
built by Martin et al. (2016b) on similar MegaCam data,
simply shifted to the appropriate reference median magni-
tude (the median magnitude of all stars in our photometry
with photometric uncertainties between 0.09-0.11). The ﬁ-
nal step normalizes this PDF to unity so it is properly de-
ﬁned. An example of the resulting model is shown in the
left-hand panel of Figure 3 for the speciﬁc set of parame-
ters PCMD = {m − M = 16.67, A = 13.5 Gyr, [Fe/H]CMD =
−2.4, [α/Fe] = +0.6}.

The model for (cid:96)MW

CMD is built empirically from the CMD
position of ﬁeld stars in the MegaCam data. We select all
stars beyond 5rh and bin them in CMD space. Each bin has a
width of 0.01 mag along both the magnitude and the colour
directions. In order to diminish the amount of shot noise
in the resulting binned CMD, we further smooth it with a
Gaussian kernel of width 0.1 mag in both dimensions. The
resulting smoothed CMD is presented in Figure 3 after its
normalization so it is a properly deﬁned PDF.

With the model being entirely deﬁned, we can now fo-
cus on the inference on the model’s parameters. Since the
structural side of the analysis can be biased by the presence
of the chip gaps visible in Figure 1, they are accounted for
by constructing a binary mask correcting the eﬀective area
of the ﬁeld. From the Ntot stars present in this region, the

with Psp(Psp) the combined prior on the model parame-
ters. These priors are listed in Table 3 and are chosen to
be uniform for an old stellar population, with distance and
structural parameters loosely close to the favoured param-
eters according to Laevens et al. (2015). Anticipating on
section 4, the systemic metallicity of the satellite is found to
be (cid:104)[Fe/H]CaHK
DraII (cid:105) = −2.7 ± 0.1 dex using the narrow-band,
CaHK photometry. This result is used as a Gaussian prior
to the CMD analysis.

In order to build the posterior N-dimensional distri-
bution function, we devised our own Markov Chain Monte
Carlo code based on a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hast-
ings 1970). To ensure convergence, we aim for an acceptance
ratio of ∼ 25 per cent and run the algorithm for a few million
iterations. Convergence is not an issue for this large num-
ber of iterations. Finally, for the CMD analysis, we restrict
ourselves to a speciﬁc region of the CMD: a visual inspec-
tion of the Dra II main sequence in Figure 2 shows that all
stars outside −0.5 < (g − i)0 < 2.0 are contaminants. For
this reason, there is no need to take them into account in
our analysis, and the following CMD and structural anal-
yses are performed only with stars with 15 < g0 < 24.5,
and −0.5 < (g − i)0 < 2.0. The resulting two-dimensional
marginalised PDFs are presented in Figure 4 for spacial and
5 for CMD parameters.

Our results are compatible with the ones presented by
Laevens et al. (2015) in the discovery paper of Dra II. From
the deeper MegaCam data, we conﬁrm the half-light radius
of the satellite to be rh = 3.0+0.7

before). Overall, the deeper MegaCam data allows for bet-
ter constraints with smaller uncertainties on all parameters.
The use of a Plummer proﬁle instead of an exponential pro-
ﬁle yields similar results. The radial proﬁle of the favoured
spacial model is presented in Figure 8.

The CMD part of the analysis yields a robust distance
estimate (m − M = 16.67 ± 0.05 mag; or a heliocentric dis-
tance d = 21.5 ± 0.4 kpc) that is slightly smaller than the
one proposed by Laevens et al. (2015), who estimated a dis-
tance modulus of ∼ 16.9 by eye. The favoured isochrone also
corresponds to a stellar population of A = 13.5 ± 0.5 Gyr,
[Fe/H]CMD = −2.40 ± 0.05 dex, and [α/Fe] = +0.6 dex.
The 1D PDFs of the CMD parameters are shown in Fig-
ure 5, while Figure 6 shows that this stellar population is a
good description of the features in the CMD of Dra II and
of the stars identiﬁed as members of the satellite through a
spectroscopic study (see section 5). The choice of showing
only 1D PDFs for the CMD inference is purely aesthetic:
each parameter is chosen over a grid that can have large
steps (e.g. [α/Fe] is chosen over a grid with 0.2 dex step),
which does not give representative or aesthetically pleasing

grid. This does not signiﬁcantly change our results.

The alpha-abundance ratio of the favoured model is to
be taken with caution as it reaches the limits of the [α/Fe]
range allowed by this set of isochrones. The alpha abundance
of 0.6 found above is high but not totally unrealistic for a
dwarf galaxy: Vargas et al. (2013) shows that faint Milky
Way dwarf galaxies such as Segue 1 (MV ∼ −1.5) are com-
patible with this result. Another ﬁt was performed using an

ness model used, the favoured CMD and spacial model are
used to simulate a Dra II-like population. The analysis is
then performed three more times: one time with our actual
completeness model, and two other times using the com-
pleteness model shifted by ± 0.5 mag respectively. The re-
sults of these analyses are all consistent within the uncer-

tainties, showing that the impact of the completeness model
is limited and that it does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect our results.

The systemic metallicity of the satellite appears consis-
tent with the luminosity-metallicity relation for DGs and
with the analysis previously proposed by Martin et al.
(2016a) in a qualitative analysis of their spectra. We re-
peat the Calcium-triplet equivalent-width analysis of Mar-
tin et al. (2016a) for the three low-RGB stars with S/N > 10
that used the Starkenburg et al. (2010) relation. It is worth
pointing out that this relation is calibrated for RGB stars.
However, Leaman et al. (2013) implies that it can be applied
to stars 2 magnitudes below the RGB and give consistent
results. The analysis yields a systemic metallicity for Dra II

of [Fe/H]spectro = −2.43+0.41
−0.82 dex, which is compatible with
our CMD analysis. Due to the lack of bright member stars
(the brightest used in this analysis has g0 = 18.8), it is
challenging to obtain tight constrains on the spectroscopic
metallicity of the satellite.

As a sanity check, the main sequence of Dra II can
be compared to the ﬁducials of old and metal-poor glob-
ular clusters constructed by Bernard et al. (2014). A few of
those ﬁducials are overlaid on the CMD of Dra II in Fig-
ure 7. From this ﬁgure, ﬁducials in the metallicity ranges
−2.4 < [Fe/H] < −2.0 and −1.8 < [Fe/H] < −1.4 provide
good visual match to the Dra II features and its spectro-
scopically conﬁrmed members (determined in section 5 be-

low and highlighted in yellow in the ﬁgure). The most metal-
poor ﬁducials, however, provide a better match for stars with
Pmem > 0.01 brighter than g0 = 19 mag. Although this does
not give any precise quantitative information on the metal-
licity of Dra II, it conﬁrms the metallicity measured from
the CMD-ﬁtting procedure and from spectroscopy.

Our spacial and CMD models can be used to estimate
the Dra II membership for each star by computing the ratio
of the satellite likelihood, LDraII ( (cid:126)d), over the total likeli-
hood LDraII ( (cid:126)d)+LMW . These membership probabilities are
reported in Table 3 for all stars in the spectroscopic sample.
The membership probability can also be used to draw the
density map of the Dra II-like stellar population. The ﬁeld is
binned with intervals of width 0.5 arcminutes in both X and
Y. For each bin, we count the density of stars. The map is
further convolved with a gaussian kernel of 2 arcminutes. To
identify potential structures, the distribution of background
pixels, i.e. pixels located further than 4.0rh, is ﬁtted with a
gamma distribution. Pixels with a density within the upper
68, 95, and 99.85 per cent of the total background pixels
distribution are represented with magenta, pink, and white
contours in Figure 9. This map tentatively reveals the exis-
tence of an extended Dra II-like structure over the ﬁeld of
view, consistent with the orientation of the major axis of the
satellite. This hint of extra-tidal features could be the sign
that Dra II could be tidal disrupting. The orbit of Dra II
we infer in section 6 is consistent with the direction of these
potential tails. We stress that this needs to be conﬁrmed
with a spectroscopic search for members in these regions.

Finally, we investigate the presence of mass segregation
within the system as this phenomenon can occur in globular
clusters, but not in dwarf galaxies, and could therefore be
used as a diagnostic for the nature of the satellite (Kim
et al. 2015). The stellar population models provided by the
Darmouth library give an estimate of the mass of a given star
following these isochrones. Using this piece of information,
each star within 3rh is associated with its most likely mass
by comparison with the favoured isochrone. This subsample
is then separated into three mass ranges (0.5 – 0.6M(cid:12), 0.6 –
0.7M(cid:12), and 0.7 – 0.8M(cid:12)). The cumulative number of stars
in each mass range with respect to their radial distance to
Dra II is ﬁnally computed. This procedure is repeated for
stars with a membership probability above 1, 35 and 50
per cent respectively to investigate the potential eﬀect of
the contamination on the analysis. The results are shown
in Figure 10 for the 35 per cent case. This analysis gives
no conclusive evidence of mass segregation in the satellite.
Choosing a membership probability threshold of 1 and 50
per cent does not change signiﬁcantly the results.

3.2 Luminosity and absolute magnitude MV

We rely on the method presented in Martin et al. (2016a) to
determine the total luminosity of the satellite: this method
uses the PDFs on the stellar population of Dra II and on
the number of stars within the MegaCam data, N ∗, to infer
the total luminosity of the system. Therefore, it does not
correspond to the sum of the ﬂuxes of all stars seemingly
members of Dra II in the observed CMD, but it can be seen
as a statistical determination of the luminosity of a system
with the structural and CMD properties of Dra II.

Figure 10. Normalised cumulative number of stars from 0 to
3 half-light radii, for three mass intervals : 0.8-0.7 M(cid:12) (blue),
0.7-0.6 M(cid:12) (purple) and 0.6-0.5 M(cid:12) (green). The analysis is per-
formed for all stars with a CMD membership probability above
35 per cent.

At every iteration in the procedure, we randomly draw
j value from the N ∗ PDF, as well as a set of stellar
a target N ∗
parameters (Aj, [α/Fe]j, [Fe/H]CMD,j, (m − M )j) from the
PDFs obtained through the inference of section 3.1. CMD
stars are then simulated according to the j-th stellar popu-
lation. The probability to draw a star at a given magnitude
g0 is given by the luminosity function. For each simulated
star, its colour (g − i)0 and magnitude g0 are checked. If
they fall within the CMD box used to perform the ﬁt in the
previous section, it is ﬂagged. The simulated star is then
independently checked against the completeness of the data
in both g and i. The g and i values are then converted into a
V magnitude using the colour equations presented in Tonry
et al. (2012). Once the number of ﬂagged simulated stars is
equal to N ∗
j , the ﬂux of all stars, ﬂagged or not, is summed
to yield the total luminosity, LV,j, of that realization of the
satellite. Those luminosity values are then converted into
absolute magnitudes, MV,j. Repeating this exercise several
thousands of times yields the PDFs presented in Figure 11.
From this analysis, Dra II emerges as a very faint satel-
lite, with a luminosity of only LV = 180+124
−72 L(cid:12), corre-
sponding to an absolute magnitude of MV = −0.8+0.4
−1.0 mag.
The satellite has a surface brightness of µ0 = 28.1 ± 0.7
mag.arcsec−2, comparable to the Milky-Way satellites with
the lowest surface brightness. Shifting the completeness
model by ± 0.5 mag does not signiﬁcantly change the in-
ferred luminosity. Most of the simulated CMDs contain no
RGB star much brighter than the turnoﬀ, which is compat-
ible with the absence of conﬁrmed RGB stars brighter than
g0 = 19.3 in our spectroscopic sample (Figure 7 and Table 2
for the member list) and with the observed CMD. This value
is however signiﬁcantly fainter than the one of Laevens et al.
(2015), who found a luminosity of 1259+1903
−758 L(cid:12). Two pos-
sible explanations for this diﬀerence can be proposed. First,
the photometry at hand in 2015 is 2 magnitudes shallower

than ours, thus only reaching the bright end of the main
sequence of Dra II. Finally, a small fraction of our simu-
lated CMDs still predicts the existence of a RGB star in the
satellite that could lead to a signiﬁcant increase in luminos-
ity. This is illustrated by the bright tail up to 800 L(cid:12) in the
left panel of Figure 11 which is only due to the existence of
one or two giant stars in a small fraction of our simulated
CMDs. One bright star (g < 16) in Dra II would poten-
tially be enough to solve the discrepancy between Laevens
et al. (2015) and this work. However, recent spectroscopic
investigations of bright Dra II candidates did not lead to the
identiﬁcation of any additional member with g < 17. There-
fore, the discrepancy found regarding the luminosity must be
caused by an overestimation of the additional overall num-
ber of stars by Laevens et al. (2015), driven by shallower
and noisier data.

4 NARROW-BAND CAHK ANALYSIS

The Pristine survey (Starkenburg et al. 2017) combines
CFHT narrow-band CaHK photometry with broadband
colours, typically g − i, to infer photometric metallicities
(hereafter [Fe/H]CaHK). A speciﬁc set of Pristine observa-
tions aims at observing all known northern Milky-Way dwarf
galaxy (or dwarf-galaxy candidate) with MV > −9.0. These
images are much deeper than the usual Pristine observa-
tions (1-hour vs. 100-second integrations) but remain shal-
lower than the broadband g and i photometry described in
section 3. Reliable CaHK photometry, i.e. with CaHK un-
certainty below 0.1, is achieved down to g ∼ 23.0.

In Figure 12, we show the typical colour-colour space
used by the Pristine collaboration, for which stars with
[Fe/H] ∼ −1 or lower reside in the bottom part of the
panel and more metal-poor stars towards the top. Compar-
ison via models and calibration onto thousands of stars in
common with the Segue spectroscopic survey allow us to

Figure 12. Pristine colour-colour diagram. The usual tempera-
ture proxy (g − i)0 is represented on the x-axis while the metal-
licity information is carried by the (CaHK − g) − 1.5 ∗ (g − i)
colour shown on the y-axis (see Starkenburg et al. (2017)). Stars
observed spectroscopically that pass the CaHK quality cut, i.e.
an uncertainty on the CaHK photometry below 0.1, are colour-
coded according to their heliocentric velocities. Small black dots
are ﬁeld stars and form a clear stellar locus of more metal-rich
stars ([Fe/H] ∼ −1 or above) while more metal-poor stars are lo-
cated towards above this sequence. Two iso-metallicity sequences
with [Fe/H] = −3.5 and [Fe/H] = −1.8 are shown as green and
red dashed lines, respectively. Most stars compatible with the
velocity of Dra II (red-orange) are located between these two se-
quences, and form a distinct, more metal-poor population than
the rest of the spectroscopic sample made of more metal-rich
halo and disc stars. The black dashed lines show a colour cut
of 0.1 < (g − i)0 < 1.1, which is applied to discard potential fore-
ground dwarfs. A, B and C are the three stars close to the Dra II
velocity peak that were discarded using the CaHK and CMD cuts
(see the text for more detail).

assign a [Fe/H]CaHK value to all these stars (Starkenburg
et al. 2017; Youakim et al. 2017). Two iso-metallicity se-
quences of respectively [Fe/H] = −3.5 (green dashed line)
and [Fe/H] = −1.8 (red dashed line) are shown in the ﬁgure
for illustration purposes. In the ﬁgure, we also highlight stars
that are part of our DEIMOS spectroscopic sample that will
be discussed in the next section. The group of likely Dra II
members at vr ∼ −345 km s−1 mainly clumps along a low
metallicity sequence that is compatible with the low metal-
licity inferred from the broadband photometry.

The Starkenburg et al. (2017) Pristine metallicity model
tends to slightly underestimate the metallicity at the low-
metallicity end. Therefore, before turning to the Dra II
CaHK data, we ﬁrst estimate and correct for this bias
when determining a [Fe/H]CaHK. We use the same cata-
logue Starkenburg et al. (2017) used to build their (CaHK,
g, i) to [Fe/H]CaHK model, with the same quality criteria
on the Pristine photometry and SEGUE/SDSS spectra. We
bin this sample of 3,999 stars into 0.2 dex bins in metal-
licity for stars in the interval −4.0 < [Fe/H]CaHK < −1.0.
For each of these bins, we determine the median value of
both [Fe/H]SEGUE and [Fe/H]CaHK. The bias is then deﬁned
as the diﬀerence between these two values. This set of val-
ues is then ﬁtted with a third-order polynomial to model

This bias is, at most, of ∼ 0.2 dex at [Fe/H] ∼

< −2.0.

For every star in the Dra II sample with uncertainties
on the CaHK magnitude below 0.1, we ﬁrst apply the model
of Starkenburg et al. (2017) to infer a photometric metallic-
ity, which we then correct for the bias modeled above. The
area-normalised metallicity distribution for stars within 2rh
of Dra II is shown in red in Figure 13. For comparison, the
black-dashed histogram shows the same distribution but for
ﬁeld stars, i.e. for all stars outside 5rh. Dra II stars stand
out quite prominently as a signiﬁcantly metal-poor overden-
sity compared to the ﬁeld contamination. A lot of stars in
the ﬁgure appear to be at the same photometric metallicity
around -3.0. However, the calibration of the Pristine model
becomes unreliable at [Fe/H]CaHK ∼ −3.0. The high number
of stars at ∼ −3.0 stars is probably a consequence of this.

Using Pristine metallicities, we want to infer both the
mean metallicity of the system, (cid:104)[Fe/H]CaHK
DraII (cid:105), and its dis-
persion σ[Fe/H]. In order to do so, we assume that the dis-
tribution of photometric metallicities in the Dra II sample
corresponds to a Gaussian-distributed Dra II population and
a contamination model Lbkg, which is constructed empiri-
cally from the ﬁeld data outside a 5rh radius. The metal-
licity distribution of this contamination sample is binned,
then smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 0.1 dex to account
for poor number counts in some metallicity bins. Finally, we
assume the following metallicity distribution model:

L({[Fe/H]CaHK,k, δ[Fe/H],k}|(cid:104)[Fe/H]CaHK

DraII (cid:105), σ[Fe/H])

tainty on the photometric metallicity of star k, and σk =

The inference analysis yields the two-dimensional joined
PDF of (cid:104)[Fe/H]CaHK
DraII (cid:105) and σ[Fe/H] presented in Figure 14.
The metallicity of the system is found to be (cid:104)[Fe/H]CaHK
DraII (cid:105) =
−2.7 ± 0.1 dex, with a metallicity dispersion lower than
0.24 dex at the 95% conﬁdence level. The favoured sys-
temic metallicity conﬁrms that Dra II is signiﬁcantly metal-
poor. The fraction of Dra II stars favoured by the analy-
sis is η ∼ 0.6, corresponding to a total of 41 stars. The
metallicity dispersion of the satellite cannot be resolved with
this dataset. Performing the analysis using an asymmetrical
gaussian does not change signiﬁcantly change our results.

In order to validate our inference based on the CaHK
metallicities, the same analysis is performed on the Pris-
tine data of two metal-poor globular clusters, M15 and
in this case as their
M92. Globular clusters are crucial
metallicity dispersion is expected to be too small to be re-
solved using purely photometric metallicities and they are
a good test of the quality of our constraints on σ[Fe/H].
Carretta et al. (2009a, C09) and Carretta et al. (2009b,
C09b) showed that both clusters have a similar spectro-
scopic metallicity, with [Fe/H]C09b = −2.34 ± 0.06 dex
for M15 and [Fe/H]C09 = −2.35 ± 0.05 dex for M92, as
well as metallicity dispersions around ∼ 0.05. The appli-
cation of our inference model to the globular cluster Pris-
tine datasets yields (cid:104)[Fe/H]M15(cid:105) = −2.32 ± 0.04 dex and
(cid:104)[Fe/H]M92(cid:105) = −2.38 ± 0.05 dex, compatible with the val-
ues of C09. As expected, the inferred metallicity dispersions
are unresolved for both clusters, as can be seen with the
coloured contours in Figure 14. The favoured models yields
43 stars for M15 and 25 stars for M92, comparable to the
41 stars studied in Dra II.

The inference on the metallicity mean and dispersion
for the two globular clusters is as expected and yields conﬁ-
dence that the CaHK metallicities are reliable. We therefore
conclude that Dra II is indeed a very metal-poor satellite
and we further note that despite similar numbers of member
stars in the three systems, the Dra II metallicity dispersion
PDF is wider than that of the clusters, which may hint at a
larger metallicity dispersion for Dra II.

5 SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSIS

We now investigate the dynamical properties of the satellite
using our spectroscopic data, for which the processing was
detailed in section 2.2. Examples of spectra can be found
in Figure 4 of Martin et al. (2016a), who display 4 spec-
tra of our 2015 run that are representative of the whole
dataset since the 2016 spectroscopic observations were per-
formed under similar conditions and have similar quality.
Their spacial and CMD distribution are shown in Figure 15.
The histograms of heliocentric velocities for our 2015 and
2016 runs combined are shown in the middle panel of Fig-
ure 16.

Dra II stars clearly stand out in Figure 16 as they form
a peak around −345 km s−1, as was already pointed out by
(9)
Martin et al. (2016a) in their initial analysis of the 2015
data set. A broader distribution around ∼ −45 km s−1 cor-
responds to stars from the Milky Way disc while Milky Way
halo stars are responsible for the sparsely distributed veloc-
ities throughout the range shown here. In order to better
constrain the dynamical properties of the system, one has

troscopic sample, we isolate stars with good CaHK photom-
etry (δCaHK < 0.1), metallicity uncertainties below 0.3 dex,
and, following Figure 13, with −3.5 < [Fe/H]CaHK < −1.8.
Further applying a CMD-cut along the favoured isochrone
of section 3.1 yields the cleaned velocity sample that is pre-
sented in the bottom panel of Figure 16. It is obvious that
the combined CaHK and CMD information has signiﬁcantly
cleaned the velocity distribution, leaving only highly proba-
ble Dra II stars. As a result, star A is clearly not a member:
not only is it far from the Dra II sequence in the CMD,
but it is also far too metal-rich to belong to the system.
Star B seems to be at the appropriate photometric metal-
licity to be a Dra II member but is oﬀset from the Dra II
main sequence by 0.1 mag in the CMD. This location cor-
responds to a part of the CMD where one might expect to
ﬁnd Dra II binary stars (Romani & Weinberg 1991), which
could mean that this star is a Dra II member in a binary
star and therefore not reliable for the velocity analysis. We
also conservatively discard star C for the same reason, even
though it falls within the Dra II velocity peak. Keeping star
C or discarding it does not change our results on the ve-
locity properties of Dra II. Including B in the sample also
has no signiﬁcant impact as its velocity uncertainty is large
(∼ 15 km s−1).

In order to derive the systemic velocity and velocity
dispersion of Dra II from this clean sample, we follow the
framework of Martin et al. (2018) and assume stars are nor-
mally distributed. The likelihood function is therefore

L({vr,k, δv,k}|(cid:104)vr(cid:105), σv) =

tainty ﬂoor tied to DEIMOS observations. Here we use the
value determined by Martin et al. (2016a, δv,sys = 2.3 km
s−1), which is compatible with the value we determine from
the few stars in common between the Dra II 2015 and 2016
samples.

v,k + δ2

The resulting 1D PDFs of the velocity dispersion and
systemic velocity are shown in Figure 17. These updated
results do not change signiﬁcantly from those presented by
Martin et al. (2016a), despite our slightly larger sample and
the removal of dubious members by using the CaHK photo-
metric metallicities. The velocity dispersion of Dra II is only
marginally resolved, whereas the inferred systemic velocity
is (cid:104)vr(cid:105) = −342.5+1.1
−1.2 km s−1. Assuming a mass-to-light ratio
(M/L) of 2 typical of MW globular clusters (McLaughlin &
van der Marel 2005), a Dra II-like GC with a size of ∼ 19 pc
and absolute magnitude of ∼ −0.8 mag is expected to have
a velocity dispersion of the order of ∼ 0.25 km s−1 if it is
in equilibrium and unaﬀected by binaries, using the relation
of Walker et al. (2009). Therefore, even with a dispersion
as small as ∼ 1 km s−1, Dra II would still possess a signiﬁ-
cant amount of DM but, unfortunately, the radial velocities
of the 14 members do not constrain the M/L ratio of the
satellite.

Figure 14. Two-dimensional joined PDFs of the systemic CaHK
metallicity and its associated dispersion for Dra II (black) and
the globular clusters M15 and M92 (blue and red-dashed line,
respectively). The marginalised one-dimensional PDFs are shown

contours represent the usual 1, 2 and 3σ conﬁdence intervals in
the case of a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution.

to isolate Dra II members as well as possible. Particular care
should be taken when handling the contamination by Milky
Way halo stars that are distributed within a broad velocity
range that includes the systemic velocity of the satellite. For
this reason, it would not be surprising to ﬁnd a few contam-
inating stars in the vicinity of the velocity peak of Dra II.
In particular, one can also notice the existence of two slight
outliers around the Dra II velocity peak, noted stars A and
B. It is quite challenging to know whether those stars are
bona ﬁde members based only on their kinematic properties.
This is a common problem when dealing with such faint sys-
tems for which only a handful of members are conﬁrmed: the
velocity dispersion and systemic velocity can be biased by
slight outliers that are in fact not members (McConnachie
& Cˆot´e 2010).

Pristine CaHK photometry can be very useful to clean
the spectroscopic sample as the Dra II stellar population is
very metal-poor, as shown in section 3.1. All Dra II members
are too faint to yield reliable spectroscopic metallicities but
it is expected that they can be disentangled from Milky-Way
contaminants by using the CaHK photometric metallicities
described in the previous section.

The Pristine colour-colour diagram presented in Fig-
ure 12 highlights the location of stars with heliocentric ve-
locities, which are colour-coded according to those. As men-
tioned before, the metal-rich stars from the disc form a clear
stellar locus at the bottom of the panel, whereas metal-
poor stars are always located above this locus. The two iso-
metallicity sequences that bracket the metallicity peak visi-
ble in Figure 13, with [Fe/H] = −3.5 and [Fe/H] = −1.8, are
represented by the green- and red-dashed line, respectively.
As expected, stars with velocities compatible with the sys-
temic velocity of Dra II (red-orange) are clearly isolated from
the metal-rich, foreground contamination from the Milky
Way. Most of the other stars from the spectroscopic sample
lie in or close to the metal-rich stellar locus. To help discrimi-
nate between Dra II stars and the contamination in our spec-

observed spectroscopically do not overlap small black dots as those correspond only to Dra II like population and do not represent the
full photometric dataset. Right panel: Distribution of the spectroscopic sample in the CMD within two half-light radii of Dra II. Stars

6 GAIA DR2 PROPER MOTIONS AND ORBIT

To determine the orbit of Dra II, we extract the proper mo-
tions (PMs) of all stars within half a degree from Dra II’s
centroid in the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018a). A cross-match between the 14 identiﬁed mem-
ber stars in section 5 is then performed, resulting in 10 mem-
bers with a PM measurement. The PMs of the 10 Dra II
members are shown in red in Figure 18. The uncertainty-
weighted PM of Dra II yields µ∗,DraII
= µDraII
cos(δ) =
α
1.26 ± 0.27 mas.yr−1 and µDraII
= 0.94 ± 0.28 mas.yr−1, and
is shown in Figure 18 as the large, green dot. These mea-
surements take into account the systematic error of 0.035
mas.yr−1 on the PMs for dSph as shown by Gaia Collab-
oration et al. (2018b). However, if we instead choose the
systematic error presented in that paper for the GCs, our
results do not change given the measured uncertainties on
µ∗,DraII

and µDraII

These measurements can be used to put constraints on
the orbit of the satellite. To do so, we rely on the GALPY
package (Bovy 2015). The MW potential chosen to inte-
grate Dra II orbit is based on the so-called “MWPoten-
tial14” deﬁned within GALPY, constituted of three compo-
nents: a power-law, exponentially cut-oﬀ bulge, a Miyamoto-
Nagai potential disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White DM halo.
A more massive halo is chosen for this analysis, with a mass
of 1.2 × 1012 M(cid:12) (vs. 0.8 × 1012 M(cid:12) for the halo used in
MWPotential14). We integrate 1000 orbits backwards and
forwards over 6 Gyr, each time by randomly drawing a po-
sition, distance, radial velocity, and PMs from their corre-

sponding PDFs, and extract for each realization the apoc-
enter, pericenter, and ellipticity. The orbit of the favoured
model (i.e. favoured position, distance, radial velocity and
PMs) is shown in Figure 19 in the X-Y, X-Z and Y-Z planes,
and colour-coded by time. Five random realizations of the
orbit are also shown in this ﬁgure as partially transparent,
grey lines.

This analysis yields a pericenter of 21.3+0.7

−1.0 kpc, an
apocenter of 153.8+56.7
−34.7 kpc and an ellipticity of 0.77+0.08
−0.06.
Dra II seems to be on a quasi-perpendicular orbit with re-
spect to the disk of the MW. Our orbit is compatible with
the one of Simon (2018), though they favour a slightly higher
apocenter due to their use of a light MW (0.8 × 1012 M(cid:12)).
This is conﬁrmed by the analysis of Fritz et al. (2018), whose
results are also consistent with ours. Our larger sample nev-
ertheless provides a more stringent constraint on the orbit
of Dra II. The fairly elliptical orbit and the small pericenter
we infer appear compatible with the idea that the satellite
has been severely aﬀected by tides and could explain the
low-surface brightness features seen in Figure 9 that roughly
align with the PM vector.

ern sky dwarf-galaxy candidates. We also present an analysis
of the extension of our multi-object spectroscopy observed
with Keck II/DEIMOS.

We estimate the structural parameters of Dra II and
infer properties that are compatible with the previous study
of the satellite by Laevens et al. (2015) albeit with smaller
uncertainties: the system has a half-light radius of rh =
−2.6 pc and is remarkably faint (LV = 180+124
19.0+4.5
−72 L(cid:12)).
Based on the CMD information of the observed stars, we
conﬁrm that Dra II hosts an old stellar population with an
age of 13.5±0.5 Gyr, a metallicity [Fe/H]CMD = −2.40±0.05
dex, [α/Fe] = +0.6 dex, and a distance modulus of m−M =
16.67 ± 0.05 mag. Using the Pristine photometry, we were
able to ﬁnd an estimate of the metallicity of Dra II with
(cid:104)[Fe/H]CaHK
DraII (cid:105) = −2.7 ± 0.1 dex. This inference is conﬁrmed
by the analysis of 3 Dra II spectroscopic members, which
yields [Fe/H]spectro = −2.43+0.41
−0.82 dex. The metallicity de-
rived from the three diﬀerent techniques are therefore all
consistent. However, the isochrone ﬁtting procedure is lim-
ited by the model grid, for which the lowest metallicity is
−2.45 dex. Three low-RGB stars were used to derive the
spectroscopic metallicity of the satellite using the Calcium
triplet relation of Starkenburg et al. (2010). However, this
relation is calibrated for RGB stars, though Leaman et al.
(2013) shows that it can give consistent results when ap-
plied to stars 2 magnitudes fainter. We therefore favour
the systemic metallicity inferred by the CaHK technique
as it does not suﬀer from these limitations. The metallic-
ity dispersion of Dra II is only marginally resolved for both
the spectroscopic and CaHK procedures. Similarly, applying
the same technique to the two old and metal-poor globular
clusters M15 and M92 yields no measurable metallicity dis-

persion, in line with expectations for globular clusters. Fi-
nally, we combined the CaHK and broad-band information
with our DEIMOS spectroscopy to isolate 14 likely member
stars. This sample is used to derive a systemic velocity of
(cid:104)vr(cid:105) = −342.5+1.1
−1.2 km s−1 and a marginally resolved veloc-
ity dispersion, conﬁrming that Dra II is a particularly cold
system. Finally, using the Data Release 2 of Gaia, we use 10
Dra II member stars to characterize the orbit of the system:
the apocenter and pericenter are found to be 153.8+56.7
−34.7 kpc
and 21.3+0.7

−1.0 kpc respectively.

Despite the deep photometry studied here and the ad-
ditional spectroscopy, the derived properties of Dra II are
still challenging to interpret and the nature of the system
remains uncertain. Dra II is placed in the general context
of Milky Way satellites in Figure 20 and, below, we discuss
two broad scenarios: whether Dra II is a globular cluster or
a dwarf galaxy.

7.1 Is Dra II a globular cluster?

Figure 20 (top-right panel) shows Dra II does not present
any clearly constrained dispersion in metallicity, in contrast
to conﬁrmed dwarf galaxies. Similarly, dwarf galaxies tend to
be dynamically hot whereas the spectroscopic analysis of 14
Dra II members only yields a marginally resolved velocity
dispersion. These two properties are compatible with the
globular cluster hypothesis.

The globular cluster scenario does not come without
diﬃculties, though. In particular, if the system contains no
dark matter, its potential well is entirely determined by its
very few stars. Using the formalism of Innanen, Harris &
Webbink (1983), the instantaneous tidal radius rt of a Milky
Way satellite of mass Mcluster at a distance of R, is given by

rt = 0.43(

Mcluster
MMW

)1/3R,

(11)

with MMW the mass of the Milky Way enclosed within that
radius R.

Using Dra II’s galactocentric distance (R ∼ 23.5 kpc)
and a cluster mass of 360M(cid:12), obtained from the measured
luminosity of Dra II and assuming a mass-to-light ratio of 2
(Bell & de Jong 2001), the tidal radius of Dra II is then a
mere ∼ 10 pc, i.e. much smaller than the extent of a system
with a measured half-light radius of 19.0+4.5
−2.6 pc. We would
then be observing Dra II just as it is being destroyed by the
Milky Way’s tides and, likely, on its ﬁnal passage around the
Galaxy. It would mean that we are observing Dra II during
a unique and short-lived moment of its lifetime, and would
be a way to explain the relatively high size of the satellite
compared to globular clusters of similar faintness : Kim 1
(rh ∼ 7 pc), Kim 3 (rh ∼ 2 pc) and Bal 1 (rh ∼ 7 pc)
discovered recently (Conn et al. 2018; Koposov et al. 2007;
Luque et al. 2016; Martin et al. 2016c).

Finally, the absence of any sign of mass segregation,
which could occur in self-gravity dominated systems such a
globular clusters (Kim et al. 2015), could also cast doubt
on the globular-cluster nature of Dra II, even though the
existence of mass segregation, especially in a GC possibly in
the midst of disruption, is not certain.

7.2 Is Dra II one of the faintest dwarf galaxies?

The top-left panel of Figure 20 showcases that Milky Way
dwarf galaxies follow a reasonably well-deﬁned luminosity-
metallicity relation (see also, e.g., Kirby et al. 2013). For
an extremely faint stellar system like Dra II, one would ex-
pect its metallicity to be very low ([Fe/H] ∼ −2.5) if it
were a dwarf galaxy, which is compatible with our results
using independently the CaHK photometry ([Fe/H]CaHK =
−2.7±0.1 dex) and spectroscopy of 3 low-RGB member stars
([Fe/H]spectro = −2.43+0.41
−0.82 dex). Given the scatter and pos-
sible stochastic eﬀects of the metallicity-luminosity relation
of dwarf galaxies (Revaz & Jablonka 2018), Dra II is entirely
compatible with this relation. Moreover, Dra II has a size

that await conﬁrmation. Hollow markers correspond to systems for which no metallicity dispersion measurement can be found in the
literature. The solid line in the top-left panel corresponds to the luminosity-metallicity relation of Kirby et al. (2013) for dwarf spheroidals
and dwarf irregulars. Dashed lines represent the RMS about this relation, also taken from Kirby et al. (2013). Among the 123 globular
clusters presented here, the properties of 116 were extracted from Harris (1996) catalog, revised in 2010. For the remaining ones (Kim
1, Kim 2, Kim 3, Laevens 1, Balbinot 1, Munoz 1 and SMASH 1) parameters of the discovery publications were used (Kim & Jerjen

(2012) and Willman & Strader (2012) are used to compile the properties of the dwarf galaxies represented here. The 18 dwarf galaxies
represented here are: Bootes I (Belokurov et al. 2006; Norris et al. 2010), Canes Venatici I (Zucker et al. 2006b), Canes Venatici II
(Sakamoto & Hasegawa 2006), Coma Berinices, Hercules, Leo IV and Segue I (Belokurov et al. 2007), Draco and Ursa Minor (Wilson
1955), Fornax (Shapley 1938b), Leo I and Leo II (Harrington & Wilson 1950), Pisces II (Belokurov et al. 2010), Sculptor (Shapley 1938a),
Sextans (Irwin et al. 1990), Ursa Major I (Willman et al. 2005b), Ursa Major II (Zucker et al. 2006a), Willman I (Willman et al. 2005a).
Their metallicity and metallicity spreads were drawn from Kirby et al. (2008), Kirby et al. (2010), Norris et al. (2010), Willman et al.
(2011). The dwarf galaxy candidates discovered recently and shown on this ﬁgure are Bootes II (Koch & Rich 2014), DES1 (Luque et al.
2016; Conn et al. 2018), Eridanus III (Bechtol et al. 2015; Conn et al. 2018; Koposov et al. 2015b), Hyades II (Martin et al. 2015),
Pegasus III (Kim & Jerjen 2015), Reticulum II and Horologium I (Koposov et al. 2015a), Segue II (Belokurov et al. 2009), and the most
signiﬁcant candidates of Drlica-Wagner et al. (2015) : Gru II, Tuc III, and Tuc IV.

larger than the vast majority of known Milky Way globular
clusters and, in particular, it is several times more extended
than GCs of roughly the same luminosity and metallicity, as
mentioned in the last section (bottom-left panel of Figure
20).

The inference on the metallicity dispersion of the satel-
lite was performed through the spectroscopic analysis of 3
low-RGB member stars, and a new technique using the pho-
tometric CaHK metallicities of 41 stars. Though both meth-
ods do not resolve a signiﬁcant metallicity dispersion, the
ﬁnal results do not rule it out for the system, because of the
faintness and low number of the stars used in both analy-
ses. Similarly, the velocity dispersion PDF of Dra II does
not rule out a dynamical mass higher than expected from
a globular cluster: if we use the Walker et al. (2009) equa-
tion 4 to estimate the dynamical mass, assuming a mass-to-
light ratio of 2 that is typical for globular clusters (Bell &
de Jong 2001), and the luminosity and half-light radius in-
ferred in this work, a Dra II-like globular cluster should have
a velocity dispersion around ∼ 0.25 km s−1. It is therefore
challenging to determine whether the satellite has a higher
dynamical mass than traced by its stars alone, as even a
velocity dispersion of the order of 1 km s−1 would indicate
that Dra II has a DM halo.

Figure 9 highlights that there might be extended tidal
structures around Dra II, consistent with the proper mo-
tion vector and the major-axis of the satellite. Its metallic-
ity is still compatible with brighter dwarf galaxies following
the metallicity-luminosity relation. Moreover, Pe˜narrubia,
Navarro & McConnachie (2008) showed that the velocity
dispersion of a disrupted dwarf galaxy tends be lower than
the original progenitor, consistent with the fact that Dra II
appears to be dynamically cold. Could Dra II then be the
ﬁnal remnant of a brighter dwarf galaxy that lost 90 per
cent of its mass through tidal interactions with the Milky
Way? Such a disruption would not be surprising given the
orbit of the satellite, with a pericenter of 21.3+0.7

−1.0 kpc.

7.3 Conclusion

The properties of Draco II tend to indicate that the satellite
is a potentially disrupting dwarf galaxy, which could explain
its total luminosity, metallicity, size, and relatively low ve-
locity dispersion. The orbit of the satellite, constrained with
Gaia PMs, shows that the satellite is very likely to be af-
fected by tidal processes, which is backed up by potential
tidal structures observed in the ﬁeld. However, the impos-
sibility, with our current dataset, to constrain the metallic-
ity dispersion of Dra II casts a doubt of the nature of the
satellite, which might well be a globular cluster observed at
the very end of its disruption process. Even though chal-
lenging, obtaining high signal-to-noise spectra of the faint
main-sequence stars of Dra II currently provides the only
hope of unravelling the mystery still surrounding Dra II.
