Degeneracy in Density Functional Theory: Topology in v- and n-Space

C. A. Ullrich∗ and W. Kohn
Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106
(Dated: October 31, 2018)

This paper clariﬁes the topology of the mapping between v- and n-space in fermionic systems.
Density manifolds corresponding to degeneracies g = 1 and g > 1 are shown to have the same
mathematical measure: every density near a g-ensemble-v-representable (g-VR) n(r) is also g-VR
(except “boundary densities” of lower measure). The role of symmetry and the connection between
T = 0 and T = 0+ are discussed. A lattice model and the Be-series are used as illustrations.

PACS numbers: 31.15.Ew, 31.15.Ar, 71.10.Ca, 71.15.Mb

Density functional theory (DFT) of electrons in an ex-
ternal potential v(r) uses the ground-state density n(r)
as basic variable [1, 2]. n(r) uniquely determines v(r)
(apart from a constant); conversely, for a given number,
N , of electrons, v(r) obviously determines n(r) uniquely
if and only if the ground state is non-degenerate. These
facts point to the interesting role of degeneracy in the
mapping v(r) ⇐⇒ n(r).

In 1982-3, Levy [3] and Lieb [4] discovered exam-
ples of well-behaved density functions, n(r), which could
not be reproduced as non-degenerate, non-interacting
ground-state densities of any v(r), and were called non-
v-representable (non-VR). In these examples, the n(r)
could be reproduced as weighted averages of densities of
degenerate ground states corresponding to a v(r).

Soon afterwards, Kohn [5] adopted a lattice version
of the Schr¨odinger equation, r → rl (l = 1, . . . , M ), in
which v(r) and n(r) become vl and nl and can be viewed
as M ′-dimensional (M ′-D) vectors: ~v ≡ (v1, . . . , vM ′ ),
with M ′ ≡ M − 1, vM = 0; and ~n ≡ (n1, . . . , nM ′ ), with
nM = N − (n1 + . . . + nM ′ ) [6]. The M lattice points
are enclosed by boundary points on which ~v = +∞ and,
accordingly, all wave functions vanish. It was shown in
[5] that in the M ′-D ~n-space there are ﬁnite M ′-D regions
in which all “points” (densities) are VR.

In 1985, Chayes et al. (CCR) [7], using a similar lattice
model, proved the following important result: Any well-
behaved ~n (0 < nl ≤ 1) can be uniquely represented as
weighted average of g degenerate ground-state densities
associated with a ~v. We call the special case g = 1 1-
VR, and the general case (g ≥ 1) g-VR. Thus, ~n-space is
ﬁlled by manifolds Sg, in each of which ~n is g-VR. Each
Sg maps on a corresponding manifold Qg in ~v-space.

This paper aims at an understanding of the topolo-
gies of the regions Sg and Qg and of the nature of the
boundaries between them. This has mathematical and
physical signiﬁcance, e.g. in the search for self-consistent
solutions of Kohn-Sham (KS) equations [8]. We shall see
that g-VR densities with g > 1 are not mathematically
exceptional and, in particular, do not depend on symme-
tries of the potential. As illustrations we shall present a
ﬁnite lattice model and the Be-series for Z → ∞ [9]. We
also discuss the relationship between T = 0 ensembles

and T = 0+ thermal ensembles. We limit ourselves to
systems that are everywhere nonmagnetic.

a) g = 1.

Interior regions in ~n-space. We ﬁrst recapitulate
Ref. [5] for 1-VR densities, and then generalize to g-VR.
Since there is a non-degenerate non-
interacting ground state with a ﬁnite gap, corresponding
to some ~v, we can use non-degenerate perturbation the-
ory to calculate the ﬁrst-order density change, 1nl, due
to a weak perturbing potential 1vl:

′

M

1nl =

χll′

1vl′ ,

Xl′=1

l = 1, . . . , M

′

.

(1)

Since, according to [1], the density ~n of a non-degenerate
ground state uniquely determines ~v (no arbitrary con-
stant since vM = 0), the homogeneous set of equations
corresponding to (1) has no solution other than 1vl′ ≡ 0,
so that (1) can be inverted:

1vl =

′

M

Xl′=1

χ

−1
ll′

1nl′

l = 1, . . . , M

′

.

(2)

Thus, any ﬁrst-order change of ~n preserving N produces
a density which is also 1-VR. This is the case in the entire
M ′-D neighborhood surrounding the point ~n, in which ∆
remains positive.

b) g > 1 [10]. We denote by Ψ1, . . . , Ψg a set of g
orthogonal degenerate ground-state wave functions cor-
responding to ~vg, with common energy E and ﬁnite gap
∆. The remaining eigenfunctions are Ψg+1, . . .. What
conditions must be imposed on inﬁnitesimal [O(λ)] po-
tential changes 1~v which will preserve this degeneracy?
In the space of the Ψj, the perturbed Hamiltonian matrix
is

Hij = Eiδij + 1V ij

i, j = 1, 2, . . . ,

(3)

′

M

Ei = E (i = 1, . . . , g), Ei ≥ E +∆ (i ≥ g +1), and 1Vij ≡
l=1hi|1vl|ji. Because of the ﬁnite ∆, the oﬀ-diagonal
1Vij with i ≤ g and j ≥ g + 1, or vice versa, can be
P
removed to all orders in λ by orthogonal transformations
leading to the decoupled g × g block Hamiltonian

˜Hij = Eδij + 1V ij + O(λ2)

i, j = 1, . . . , g .

(4)

 
 
 
 
 
 
Diagonalization by an orthogonal transformation Tij =
δij +1tij +O(λ2) and the requirement that the eigenvalues
remain degenerate gives a transformed Hamiltonian

¯Hij ≡

(cid:16)

−1 ˜HT

T

(cid:17)ij

= (E + 1ǫ)δij + O(λ2) .

(5)

On inverting the transformation and noting that every
matrix commutes with δij , one ﬁnds ˜Hij = ¯Hij + O(λ2).
Comparison with Eq. (4) leads to 1
2 (g − 1)(g + 2) con-
ditions of equal diagonal and vanishing oﬀ-diagonal 1Vij .
Thus, every point ~vg with a g-fold degenerate ground
state and ﬁnite ∆ is embedded in a manifold in ~v-space
of dimension Dg =
, in which the
2 (g − 1)(g + 2)
degeneracy g and a ﬁnite ∆ are preserved. Ground-state
(cid:3)
degeneracies in ~v-space are “rare” in the above sense.
Each ~vg gives rise to a set of ensemble densities,

~n =

(6)

with ~nj = ~nj (RgΨj), where Rg is a g-D orthogonal
transformation [ 1
2 g(g − 1) parameters] and the wj are
normalized weights (g − 1 parameters). Thus, all ~n′ in
a ﬁnite M ′-D neighborhood enclosing a g-VR ~n, deﬁned
by ∆(~n′) > 0 and wj > 0, are also g-VR: Degeneracy in
~n-space is not “rare”.

Boundary surfaces in ~n-space. Except for bound-
aries of D ≤ M ′ − 1, ~n-space is completely ﬁlled by M ′-D
regions Sg, with degenerate ground-state levels and a ﬁ-
nite positive gap to the nearest excited state.

Apart from “corners” (D ≤ M ′ − 2), interior regions
Sg in ~n-space are bounded by (M ′ − 1)-D internal and
external “surfaces” Σg, see Fig. 1. Each internal Σg
separates two interior regions Sg and Sg+1. A point ~n
on such a Σg corresponds to a (g + 1)-fold degenerate
ground state but with one of the g + 1 weights equal to
zero. On the g-side of Σg there is a g-fold degeneracy and
a small gap to the (g + 1)st state opens up from 0. On
the (g + 1)-side there is a (g + 1)-fold degeneracy and one
of the g + 1 weights starts from 0 and becomes positive.
External boundaries correspond to either one of the
nl becoming zero, reﬂecting particle conservation; or one
of the nl becoming 1, reﬂecting the Pauli principle. For
examples of both kinds, see the lattice model below.

Imposed symmetry conditions. Consider a Hamil-
tonian, invariant under a group G of the lattice with ir-
reducible representations h with D = gh. Let the ground
h mhgh due to mh oc-
state have total degeneracy g =
currences of h. If a small perturbation H ′ respecting the
group G is imposed, how many further conditions must
be met by H ′ so that the degeneracy is maintained?

P

We have shown above that the perturbation must have
vanishing oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements (MEs) between all
degenerate ground states, and equal diagonal MEs.

Oﬀ-diagonal MEs. The symmetry of H ′ assures imme-
diately that all oﬀ-diagonal MEs between h 6= h′ vanish

Thus, to ensure that the g-fold degenerate ground state
maintains its full degeneracy requires the imposition of

h[mh(mh − 1)/2 + mh] − 1 conditions.
Next we ask: for a ground state with g =

P
how many free parameters are there to create ensemble
densities invariant under group G of the Hamiltonian?

stricted way to assure that the density has the full sym-
metry of the Hamiltonian: Let ϕh,νh
(k = 1, . . . , gh) be a
set of orthogonal eigenfunctions, constituting a basis for
a given h of the group G, with occurrence νh = 1, . . . , mh,
such that all ϕh,νh
transform in the same way under G.

The total number of free parameters is given by those in
the rotation Rνh plus the number of independent weights
wh,νh , i.e.
h[mh(mh − 1)/2 + mh] − 1. We observe that
the total number of constraints on H ′ is equal to the total
number of free parameters in ~n. Therefore the dimension-
ality of the density invariant under G associated with any
set of degenerate states is the same, independent of G.

Lattice Example. We illustrate our topological re-
sults in an example including symmetry requirements in
~v- and ~n-space. Consider the singlet ground state of 4
non-interacting electrons, or, equivalently, 2 spinless non-
interacting fermions, whose wave functions ϕj
l are deﬁned
on a 13-point fcc lattice (see Fig. 2), and vanish on all
exterior points. The discrete Schr¨odinger equation is

gies and potentials will be measured in units of 2ma2/¯h2.
We consider cases of C4h symmetry: vl ≡ V1, l = 1–8;
vl ≡ V2, l = 9–12; v13 = 0. The lattice wave functions
belong to the following representations of C4h [11]: Ag (s-
like), Eu and Au (p-like), Eg and Bg (d-like), and Bu (f -
like). Ag occurs three times (1Ag, 2Ag, 3Ag), Eu occurs
twice (1Eu, 2Eu), all other representations occur only
once. The eigenfunctions and energies required solutions
of 3-, 2- and 1-D secular equations.

Consider the ground state of 2 non-interacting spinless
fermions. The lowest level is always 1Ag (1s-like). The
next level depends on V1 and V2, see Fig. 3. The (V1, V2)
plane divides into three distinct, inﬁnitely extended re-
gions (shown in yellow), in each of which the eigenfunc-
tion of the second level belongs to a particular irreducible
representation of C4h: Region 1a, 1Au (2pz-like); region
1b, 2Ag (2s-like); and region 1c, 1Eu (2px,2py-like). In-
side each region, the ground state is non-degenerate (not
counting degeneracies dictated by symmetry, such as in
the 2-D representation 1Eu).

On the boundary lines 2a, 2b and 2c (shown in blue),
crossings of levels belonging to diﬀerent representations
leading to two-fold (accidental) degen-
of C4h occur,
eracies. Along 2a, the potential has cubic symmetry
(V1 = V2), and the two lowest p-like levels (1Au, 1Eu)
coincide. On 2b, the 2Ag and 1Au levels cross, and on
2c, the 2Ag and 1Eu levels cross. All three boundary
lines meet in a single point, “3”, at V1 = V2 = 8. At this
point only, the ground state has a three-fold accidental
degeneracy. Note that the degeneracies on 2b and 2c are
not due to additional potential symmetries.

As shown above, a ground state with restricted symme-
h[mh(mh−1)/2+mh]−1
try maintains its degeneracy if
conditions are met. In the present example, mh = 1 al-
ways. Regions 2a, 2b, 2c are therefore lines (1 condition),
region 3 is a point (2 conditions) in the (V1, V2)-plane.

P

We now discuss all ~n with C4h symmetry. Like ~v, they
are fully characterized by two values, N1 and N2, the
total density at points 1–8 and 9–12. n13 = 2 − N1 − N2.
N1 and N2 are conﬁned within a stripe in the (N1, N2)
plane, with an “inner” boundary, with n13 = 1, reﬂecting

the Pauli principle (N1 + N2 < 1 would imply n13 >
1), and an “outer” boundary, with n13 = 0, reﬂecting
particle conservation (N1 + N2 ≤ 2).

The manifold of allowed densities in the (N1, N2) plane
is subdivided into diﬀerent regions, corresponding to
those of the (V1, V2)-plane. All of the regions in the
(N1, N2) plane have D = 2. This is in line with our
general topological results for g-VR densities.

Fig.

4 illustrates the highest occupied state along
paths in the (V1, V2) and (N1, N2) planes (see dotted
lines in Fig. 3 top and bottom): 1Au with weight 1 (re-
gion 1a), 1Eu with weight 1 (equal-weight combination of
2px, 2py-like states; region 1c), or a linear combination of
the degenerate 1Au and 1Eu (region 2a), with fractional
weights.

Physical Example: the Be-series. Be has a nomi-
nal electronic conﬁguration (1s)2(2s)2 and a term value
1S. Without interactions, 2s and 2p are degenerate.
The Be-series consists of neutral Be (Z = 4)[12], and

(˜r = Zr/4), this is equivalent to a series of Be-like atoms
with Z = 4 but with weakened interaction strength

erate conﬁgurations (1s)2(2s)2 and (1s)2(2p)2, (2p)2 =
3−1/2
j=1(2pj)2, need to be considered. This leads to
a 2 × 2 secular equation all of whose MEs are exactly
known [13]. The limiting density is explicitly 4-VR:

where the ϕ’s are scaled hydrogenic wave functions (for
Z = 4). The conﬁgurations (1s)2(2s)2 and (1s)2(2p)2
have amplitudes 0.974 and 0.225. (Unlike in CI expan-
sions [14], KS densities consist strictly of a ﬁnite number
of orbital densities for all Z).

From our previous discussion of boundary surfaces, we
observe that the density (9) is not on a boundary, since
there is no unoccupied degenerate state. Under these
conditions, any density n(r) suﬃciently near n0(r), in
general without any symmetry, is also 4-VR. In particu-
lar, there must be a ﬁnite range in 1/Z of the Be-series
where densities are 4-VR. This is borne out by numerical
calculations [15].

Density ensembles at T = 0 and 0+. Let ~vg be
a potential with g degenerate non-interacting, gapped
ground states, Φj, generating the 1
2 (g − 1)(g + 2)-D set
of ensemble densities (6). Now introduce a weak per-

4

turbing potential 1~v of order λ which, in general, splits
the degeneracy and leads to eigenstates and eigenvalues
Ψj = ¯RgΦj + O(λ); Ej = E + 1Ej, where 1Ej = O(λ),
and the corresponding densities are ~nj.

where Z =

that ¯RgΦj = Ψj and Z −1e−β
Ej = wj. As β∆ → ∞,
1v ∼ β−1 → 0 and ~n′ → ~n. This establishes the cor-
respondence between ensemble densities at T = 0 and
canonical densities at low temperatures, β∆ ≫ 1.

Concluding remarks. The problem of v-represen-
tability [3, 4] had cast a shadow of uncertainty over DFT,
which was very largely clariﬁed in [7]. Here, building on
CCR, we clarify the topology of the v(r)-n(r) mapping.
The Be-series and a lattice model are used for illustra-
tion. The transition from a dense discrete lattice, rl, to
a continuous variable, r, does not appear to oﬀer diﬃcul-
ties. An open issue is extension to spin magnetism.
