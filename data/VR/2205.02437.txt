in (a). Based on our psychophysical data collected for stimuli with varying visual characteristics, we model the likelihood distribution of the time users
take to process, react, and saccade to a target. If replacing the black placeholder in (a) with the three target candidates shown in (b), the resulting retinal
images exhibit identical perceptual similarity in terms of visual acuity, with all FovVideoVDP scores >9.5 per [Mantiuk et al. 2021]. However, they may trigger
significantly faster (leftmost of (b)) or slower (rightmost of (b)) reaction latencies with up to about 35ms difference, significantly affecting task performance.

We aim to ask and answer an essential question “how quickly do we react after
observing a displayed visual target?” To this end, we present psychophys-
ical studies that characterize the remarkable disconnect between human
saccadic behaviors and spatial visual acuity. Building on the results of our
studies, we develop a perceptual model to predict temporal gaze behavior,
particularly saccadic latency, as a function of the statistics of a displayed
image. Specifically, we implement a neurologically-inspired probabilistic
model that mimics the accumulation of confidence that leads to a perceptual
decision. We validate our model with a series of objective measurements
and user studies using an eye-tracked VR display. The results demonstrate
that our model prediction is in statistical alignment with real-world human
behavior. Further, we establish that many sub-threshold image modifications

INTRODUCTION

1
Measuring, modeling, and predicting how humans perceive and
act on displayed visual content are important tasks in computer
graphics, with applications in cinematic, real-time rendering, vir-
tual/augmented reality (VR/AR), display optimization, esports, video
compression/streaming, and visual design [Dunn et al. 2020; Man-
tiuk et al. 2004; Patney et al. 2016; Serrano et al. 2017; Sitzmann et al.
2018]. Perceptual image quality metrics predict the likelihood of
visibility of image artifacts that result from creative and technical
design, or are a side-effect of rendering, processing, or transmission.
While many such metrics already exist, research is primarily focused
on modeling the spatial/temporal acuity of the human visual system
(HVS), not on how viewers “react” after seeing the stimuli. Although
visibility may be closely related to behavior, there is evidence that
perceptually identical stimuli frequently result in significantly differ-
ent reactions for viewers [Mulckhuyse and Theeuwes 2010; Spering
and Carrasco 2015]. Since responses are critical in many interactive
applications such as esports and user interfaces, metrics that predict
user reactive performance are arguably in emerging and crucial
demand.

Researchers have so far exhaustively studied the acuity of the hu-
man visual system and established a significant body of perceptual
image-quality metrics [Hore and Ziou 2010], as well as perceptually-
optimized computer graphics techniques [Krajancich et al. 2021;
Patney et al. 2016]. Such methods have unlocked significant perfor-
mance and memory optimizations, as well as quality improvements.
A recent example is gaze-contingent rendering, which perceptually
optimizes rendering complexity for wide field-of-view (FoV) AR/VR
displays. The rendering methods achieve great savings in computa-
tion [Patney et al. 2016], bandwidth [Chen et al. 2022; Kaplanyan
et al. 2019; Krajancich et al. 2021], or enhancing visual cues [Krajan-
cich et al. 2020]. Researchers have also proposed perceptually-based
metrics that predict the visibility of artifacts in a user’s peripheral
vision [Mantiuk et al. 2021; Tursun et al. 2019]. However, to our best
knowledge, there is still very limited characterization of changes
to human reaction times when observing naturalistic visual stimuli
that are otherwise perceptually identical.

This paper proposes an analytical model for a user’s reaction time
as evidenced by their eye movements. Human eyes change visual
fixation three to four times every second [Fabius et al. 2019] via rapid
exploratory movements called saccades. Saccades allow for frequent
shifts of attention to better understand one’s surroundings and to
localize objects of interest, e.g., potential dangers [Purves et al. 2008].
Saccadic reaction latencies, after the eye observes a stimulus, are
closely tied to performance in a broad range of real-time applications.
For instance, subtly (as low as 4ms [Kim et al. 2019]) altered saccade
latency can significantly determine performance in competitive
esports [Koposov et al. 2020]. Each saccade involves perceiving a
stimulus, identifying the target [Lisi et al. 2019], sending oculomotor
neural signals, and controlling the extraocular muscles to reorient
the eyeballs. Due to these complex mechanisms, fully characterizing
changes in saccade/fixation as a function of changes in visual stimuli
remains an open problem in vision science and computer graphics.
Note that, unlike with visual quality metrics, both high and low
visibility of a target could hypothetically induce a longer processing

time for fine details or blurred content. That may lead to potential
non-correlation between acuity and saccadic latency [Kalesnykas
and Hallett 1994]. Therefore, we present a visual-oculomotor and
probabilistic model of the correlation between gaze-contingent vi-
sual stimuli and the timing of humans’ cognitive decisions to per-
form saccades. Our model adapts to different viewing tasks that
involve reacting to a stimulus in the visual field. Psychophysical
experiments demonstrate our model’s statistical effectiveness and
real-world applications such as customizing players’ action timing,
measuring esports competition fairness, and predicting performance
with various display environments.

We first conduct a preliminary psychophysical study. The results
reveal that peripheral artifact visibility fails to fully explain changes
in saccadic reaction latency. By leveraging the data, we develop a
probabilistic and closed-form visual-oculomotor model predicting
the likelihood of human saccadic latency after observing a given
visual stimulus. The model is neurologically inspired to depict a
decision-making process and is further established via machine
learning with our studied data. We validate our model using various
evaluation data partitioning and several realistic visual search tasks.
Our results demonstrate that meaningful changes in behavior may
occur even without visible artifacts, establishing the importance of
predicting user gaze behaviors. Our main contributions are:

• a series of psychophysical experiments characterizing the
disconnect between visual acuity and eye movement latencies
toward a target;

• a neurologically-inspired and closed-form probabilistic model
of human reaction time, built to effectively predict saccade
onset latency by learning from real user data;

• studies with natural images and complex tasks showing how
subtle target appearance changes may significantly alter re-
action performance, following our model’s predictions;

• demonstrations of the model’s additional applications to mea-
suring competitive game fairness and optimizing player per-
formance in esports.

data to the community at www.github.com/NYU-ICL/gaze-timing.

2 RELATED WORK
We propose a model for eye motion based on the characteristics of
the human visual system, and our primary applications lie in the
area of interactive computer graphics. Our model is an alternative
to metrics for visibility of image artifacts, which serve for similar
applications. Hence, we begin by discussing state-of-the-art in pe-
ripheral image perception and corresponding image quality metrics,
as well as recent advances in the area of gaze-contingent rendering.
We then discuss existing models for saccadic gaze motion and their
applications in computer graphics and related areas.

2.1 Human Vision and Image Quality Metrics
The HVS is a complex bio-system that perceives the visual world
using a series of optical components, retinal photoreceptors, and
neural structures, including the optic nerve and visual cortex. Al-
most all of these are highly non-uniform across the visual field. As a

consequence, our peripheral vision exhibits numerous peculiarities—
in addition to having significantly lower acuity than foveal (central)
vision, it is known to have nonuniform acuity for detection vs.
resolution tasks [Thibos et al. 1987b,a], high sensitivity for mov-
ing stimuli [McKee and Nakayama 1984] including high critical
flicker-fusion frequency [Hartmann et al. 1979], and reduced color
perception [Cohen et al. 2020; Noorlander et al. 1983].

Several models describe aspects of peripheral visual perception
and predict the visibility of stimuli at various visual eccentricities.
Many build on contrast sensitivity measurements across the visual
field [Barten 1999; Cajar et al. 2016; Daly 1992; Kelly 1979]. While
most metrics only consider spatial image characteristics [Rimac-
Drıje et al. 2010; Rimac-Drlje et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2001], some re-
cent developments also account for spatio-temporal perception [Kra-
jancich et al. 2021; Mantiuk et al. 2021]. However, all these metrics
for peripheral image quality only account for visibility of artifacts
and not for change of user behavior that might exist between per-
ceptually identical stimuli.

2.2 Gaze-Contingent Computer Graphics
Gaze-contingent rendering utilizes high-speed eye-tracking to iden-
tify the user’s gaze locations and to modify the rendered images
or display accordingly. Such techniques can often provide addi-
tional perceptual cues to improve immersion of displayed content,
e.g., perceived parallax [Konrad et al. 2020], stereo depth percep-
tion [Krajancich et al. 2020], and depth-of-field [Duchowski et al.
2014; Hillaire et al. 2008; Mauderer et al. 2014]. Leveraging the
perceptual differences between foveal and peripheral vision also
improves interactive computer graphics methods, which forms the
basis for gaze-contingent foveated rendering and displays. Foveated
methods reduce the complexity of graphics or display in the pe-
ripheral visual field, which results in an overall improvement of
performance or perceived quality [Franke et al. 2021; Guenter et al.
2012; Kaplanyan et al. 2019; Koskela et al. 2019, 2016; Meng et al.
2018; Patney et al. 2016; Polychronakis et al. 2021; Sun et al. 2017,
2020; Walton et al. 2021; Weier et al. 2016].

Existing gaze-contingent and foveated rendering algorithms rely
on how gaze location causes differences in spatiotemporal visual
perception. Typically, these methods are evaluated on the noticeabil-
ity of any visual artifacts they may introduce. Instead, we attempt to
model gaze behavior changes, e.g., saccadic latency, after observing
a stimulus. The reactive changes occur due to both subthreshold and
suprathreshold differences in visual stimuli, which can be leveraged
to predict or improve user performance in immersive visual tasks.

2.3 Models for Saccadic Eye Motion
Saccadic eye motion exhibits several unique qualities. We find lim-
ited studies in the literature that model the latency before the onset
of a saccade. Further, they do not characterize image features in a
way that may build a general-purpose metric. We discuss research
that explains the mechanism for latency that leads to a saccade and
build on this mechanism for our model.

First, the large, rapid gaze changes that occur during a saccade
are ballistic and exhibit a predictable trajectory [Bahill et al. 1975;

Kowler 2011]. Saccade amplitude, velocity, and duration are nonlin-
early related, and velocities of short saccades tend to have an asym-
metric, bell-shaped velocity profile [Bahill et al. 1975]. This behavior
lends to models that can characterize a saccade profile by only par-
tially observing it, and with a sufficiently fast eye-tracker, can predict
where an ongoing saccade will land via regression [Arabadzhiyska
et al. 2017] or neural network [Morales et al. 2021]. It can also
help improve the perceived latency of gaze-contingent computer
graphics, as studied by Albert et al. [2017].

Second, during a saccade as well as for a short period after, the
HVS experiences temporary perceptual blindness, as known as sac-
cadic suppression, and has been well-studied in literature [Burr et al.
1994; Diamond et al. 2000; Ibbotson and Cloherty 2009; Matin 1975].
Saccadic suppression naturally helps gaze-contingent graphics be
tolerant to higher eye-tracking latencies [Albert et al. 2017], and
has also been leveraged in VR redirected walking [Sun et al. 2018].
Third, saccadic eye movements have been shown to be inaccurate
and often undershoot their target [Becker and Fuchs 1969; Deubel
et al. 1982]. The magnitude of error in the landing position depends
on the degree of uncertainty in the target location as well as sensory
noise [van Beers 2007] and adaptation [Cotti et al. 2009]. Researchers
have proposed to model this uncertainty based on visual character-
istics of the target [Carpenter 2004; Lisi et al. 2019]. Such models
could help predict as well as correct for saccade errors by reducing
the frequency and size of missed and catch-up saccades. However,
we are not aware of such practical application of these models in
prior work.

Finally, another area of saccade behavior models is subtle gaze di-
rection [Bailey et al. 2009], which seeks to stimulate saccades toward
specific targets by modeling how the spatio-temporal characteristics
of a stimulus may attract a user’s gaze.

While the above studies thoroughly explain and utilize various
saccadic behaviors, we are not aware of computational models of
pre-saccadic reaction time as a function of changes in naturalistic
stimuli. Predicting this latency is potentially valuable for a variety
of applications, such as esports [Koposov et al. 2020].

Various research endeavors to explain the cognitive decision that
precedes and results in a saccadic eye movement. Several neuroe-
conomic approaches describe a generic decision-making process
where the perceptual measure of visual evidence is accumulated
stochastically. Once a threshold amount of evidence is collected, a
decision is made [Mazurek et al. 2003]. The diffusion model [Palmer
et al. 2005; Ratcliff 1978] suggests that the stochastic process may
be modeled as a random walk akin to Brownian Motion. Carpenter
[1995] assumes the rate of accumulation of visual evidence as a ran-
dom variable which stays constant throughout individual saccades,
as verified in [Reddi et al. 2003]. The above mechanisms suggest that
sub-threshold changes in a stimulus could non-trivially influence
the latency of saccade onset, as has been verified by [Mulckhuyse
and Theeuwes 2010; Spering and Carrasco 2015]. Further, since
stronger stimuli accumulate faster than weaker ones, the amount of
time required must be correlated with various visual characteristics
[Bell et al. 2006; Carpenter 2004; Mahadevan et al. 2018] and task
modalities [Yamagishi and Furukawa 2020]. There is also evidence
that the latency is a function of the target eccentricity and demo-
graphic [Mazumdar et al. 2019] but exhibits a distinct trend from

that of visual acuity [Kalesnykas and Hallett 1994]. Inspired by these
discoveries, we develop an analytical and data-driven model for sac-
cadic reaction latency, dependent on visual contrast, frequency, and
target locations. With competitive scenarios such as esports, we
further demonstrate how our model can guide virtual asset design
toward optimizing player performance and competition fairness.

3 PILOT STUDY: MEASURING SACCADIC LATENCY
We first conduct a psychophysical experiment with parameterized
stimuli to observe and measure the correlation between image char-
acteristics and the time it takes to process them in order to trigger a
saccade, and whether/how the correlation differs from that of visual
acuity. We anticipate the data collected from the participants to
serve as the inspirational and statistical basis toward a closed-form
predictive model.

Setup. The study was performed with an eye-tracked HTC Vive
Pro Eye head-mounted display as shown in Figure 2a. The hard-
ware details are specified in Table 1. During the study, participants
remained seated and perceived stimuli through the stereo display.
Before each experiment, a five-point eye-tracking calibration was
applied on each individual.

Participants. The psychophysical study was performed with 𝑛 = 5
participants (ages 22 − 28, 3 female) with normal or corrected-to-
normal vision. The participants were instructed to perform a series
of two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks for each trial. The
experiment was conducted during a single session split into 10
blocks, with each block containing 225 trials, i.e., 11250 trials in total
with all the participants. The procedure took around 2.5 hours for
each participant, including breaks between blocks, a short training
session preceding the experiment, and a debrief afterwards.

Stimuli and Tasks. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate the experiment

procedure and stimuli. The task is to:

(1) fixate at the center of the display,
(2) when visible, identify the orientation (i.e., symmetry axis)
of the Gabor pattern presented at some eccentricity in the
visual field, and

(3) make a saccade either to a left or a right target based on the

orientation of the Gabor pattern.

We include Gabor patches for all combinations of contrasts (𝑐 = {.05,
.22, .53, 1.0}), frequencies (𝑓 = {.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0} pixels-per-degree),
and eccentricities (𝑒 = {0◦, 10◦, 20◦}). Three conditions (with (𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒)
values of (.05, 4.0, 10◦), (.05, 4.0, 20◦), (.22, 4.0, 20◦)) were excluded
due to the patches not being detectable by all participants. The
eccentricity range was chosen to cover common scenarios since

the human gaze does not typically go outside 10◦ from the center
[Hatada et al. 1980], and most natural saccade sizes are less than 15◦
[Bahill 1975]. Unless otherwise specified, we use Weber contrast in
all our experiments and as input to our model.

At the beginning of each trial, the participants fixated at a cross
shown in the center of the screen. Once they successfully fixated on
the cross, it disappeared and a pair of Gaussian patches appeared
at 10◦ eccentricities to the left and right of fixation. These patches
served as the target locations to which the participants would sac-
cade to indicate their decision about the stimulus. After a small
delay—chosen randomly between 300 and 500 ms to avoid learning
effects—the primary stimulus (Gabor patch) appeared either at the
center of the screen (eccentricity=0◦), or at some eccentricity in the
inferior peripheral vision (eccentricity=10◦ or 20◦). We instructed
the participants to identify whether the Gabor stimulus was oriented
at a rotation of 45◦ clockwise from vertical, as shown in Figure 2a,
or 45◦ counter-clockwise from vertical. We further instructed them
to saccade to the target patch corresponding to their determination,
right for clockwise and left for counter-clockwise. During each trial
we recorded the subjects gaze at a rate of 120 FPS using the display’s
built-in eye tracker.

We varied the eccentricity, contrast, and frequency of Gabor
patterns across trials such that each combination of variables was
shown 5 times in each block for 10 blocks, yielding a total of 50 trials
per condition. To ensure the participants were completing the task
correctly, we discarded all trials where they do not complete the task
correctly, and repeat all mistaken trials at the end of the block until
all trials are completed. The order of these conditions was randomly
shuffled within each block to eliminate any bias. Meanwhile, all
features of the Gaussian target patches (only being used to cue
the saccade direction) remained unchanged throughout the trials.
For the practice session at the beginning of the experiment, each
participant performed one block of the study with identical settings
as in the actual study. Please refer to our supplementary video for
an animated illustration.

3.1 Results
Using a statistical saccade detection method in Section 5.3, we iden-
tify the saccadic latency as the duration between appearance of the
primary stimulus (Gabor patch) and the first frame of a participant’s
saccade. We notice that the saccade latencies exhibit an asymmet-
rical distribution as shown in Figure 2c. As the various features of
the stimulus are modulated, the overall shape of the distribution
remained consistent while the mean saccade latency varied by as
much as 25% or 100 ms as shown in Figure 3. Increasing the con-
trast of the stimuli decreases reaction latency, while increasing the
frequency increases the latency. Further, increasing the eccentricity
does not always reveal a monotonic effect, but instead a U-shaped ef-
fect with the lowest mean latency values (265 ms) plateauing at 10◦.
For breakdown visualizations, please refer to Figure 3/Appendix E
for the effects of individual characteristics and participants.

We also analyzed FovVideoVDP [Mantiuk et al. 2021] scores for all
stimuli used in the experiment. Using the median condition’s image
(𝑐 = 0.53, 𝑓 = 2 cpd, 𝑒 = 10◦) as reference, we observed 9.52 ± .03
(out of 10) value across all the stimuli being studied.

counter-clockwise orientation). The latency of the saccade response indicating the decision is recorded. Across trials, the contrast, frequency, as well as vertical
eccentricity of the reference Gabor stimulus are varied as experimental parameters. Target Gaussian patches are unchanged across all trials. (b) visualizes all
the stimuli used for this study. Chosen contrast values are 𝑐 = {0.05, 0.22, 0.53, 1.0} as measured by Weber contrast; frequency values are 𝑓 = {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0}
cpd. All stimuli were shown at eccentricity values of 𝑒 = {0◦, 10◦, 20◦}. (c) histograms of saccade latencies for one sample subject when the reference stimulus

Section 2.3). With {𝑐 = 0.53, 𝑓 = 2cpd, 𝑒 = 10◦ } as the reference stimulus, all stimuli images (from (b)) show high and similar FoVVDP scores (9.52 ± 0.03),
despite significant variances in their resulting saccade latencies.

data is aggregated using either contrast, frequency or eccentricity of the
reference Gabor patch, and averaged across the other two variables. Error
bars represent standard error of measurement. Reaction times decrease as
visibility of the stimuli is improved, and vice versa. Surprisingly, the reaction
latency when the stimulus is at the fovea is higher as compared to when it
is in mid-periphery.

3.2 Discussion
The above results and analysis reveal several remarkable discoveries
on the relationships between visual characteristics and saccadic
latency. First, using a state-of-the-art peripheral image similarity
metric [Mantiuk et al. 2021], we conclude that visual differences
between our stimuli are all well below the perceivable thresholds.
Yet, they result in a significant difference in saccadic latency. This
evidence confirms that perception of visual differences cannot alone
explain the changes in saccadic latencies. Second, the asymmetrical
probability distribution agrees with the discoveries of prior work in
measuring similar visual-oculomotor reactive latencies [Carpenter
and Williams 1995; Lisi et al. 2019; Palmer et al. 2011]. Third, at a
given eccentricity, as the visibility of the stimuli improves (either
by increasing contrast or by modulating the frequency), the latency
decreases. Meanwhile, the latency rises toward infinity whenever

visibility reduces and approaches the Contrast Sensitivity Func-
tion (CSF) threshold. Lastly, we observe a surprising effect that the
saccade latencies for a stimulus at the fovea are longer than in mid-
periphery. We hypothesize that the more analytic purpose of the
fovea causes feature extraction to take longer, similar to the results
reported by Kalensnykas et al. [1994].

The collected data and the observations drive our development
of a closed-form probabilistic model inspired by the computational
process of decision making, as detailed in the next section.

4 PROBABILISTIC MODEL OF SACCADIC REACTION
Driven by our preliminary study discoveries, we aim to establish
the computational relationship between saccadic reaction latencies
and visual characteristics of stimuli. In Section 4.1, we model the
saccadic behaviors as a random process of decision-making and
incorporate perceptual, cognitive, and individual uncertainties. Sec-
tion 4.2 shows how image characteristics such as contrast, frequency
and eccentricity relate to our model of saccadic onset latency for a
task. Sections 4.3 and 4.4 detail how we leverage our preliminary
study data to learn the resulting parameters for our model.

4.1 Random Process Model for General Decision-Making
The Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) has been leveraged in neuro-
economics and psychology to model decision-making behaviors in
perceptual tasks [Fudenberg et al. 2020]. Using this model, we may
quantify the reaction latencies for performing various tasks such as
to decide whether to stop a car upon seeing an approaching object, or
to correctly identify a friend from foe in a video game. Throughout
a decision process, DDM presents a measure of “evidence” which is
used to quantify how much confidence an individual needs to reach
a decision. “Evidence”, in this context, is accumulated over time,

This measure of earliest reach to the threshold, 𝑇 (𝛼; 𝜈), corresponds
to the reaction latency of the decision being made.

Solving for 𝑇 (𝛼; 𝜈) using Equations (1) and (3) (see Appendix A

Intuitively, random variables for evidence, 𝐴(𝑡; 𝜈) and latency,
𝑇 (𝛼; 𝜈), roughly describe inverse functions of the same stochas-
tic process, and fittingly follow Gaussian, and Inverse Gaussian
distributions respectively.

4.2 Saccade as a Visual-Oculomotor Decision-Making
Equation (4) depicts generic decision-making latencies, parameter-
ized with the evidence threshold, 𝛼, and mean evidence integration
rate, 𝜈. A saccade is a representative example of visual-oculomotor
decisions. A saccade latency results from processing visual stimuli
to gain enough evidence of the target, and then deciding to make
an eye movement. In this section, we determine how these two
parameters in Equation (4) relate to the characteristics of visual
content, such as contrast, frequency, and eccentricity, as well as the
nature of the visual task of interest.

The evidence threshold, 𝛼, is primarily dependent only on the
nature of the visual task. That is, what a visual task is asking an
individual to execute determines how confident the individual needs
to be in their belief to successfully make a saccadic decision. For
instance, Palmer et al. [2011] show that 𝛼 is invariant to modulations
in signal strength of the visual stimuli but varies across different
tasks such as feature search, conjunction search, and spatial con-
figuration search. In fact, Reddi et al. [2003] demonstrate that if an
individual is instructed to observe the same visual stimulus while
executing different tasks, the evidence integration rate, 𝜈, stays
constant while the evidence threshold, 𝛼, varies between the tasks.
We thus correlate 𝛼 with a visual task via a task description, 𝐷 ∈
𝒯, where 𝒯 is the set of all visual task descriptions which trigger
viewers’ saccades toward a target. Examples include searching for
characters of the opposing team in a given esports game, comparing
and choosing a preferred target, or the task described in Section 3.
The evidence integration rate, 𝜈, is shown to change depending
on the difficulty to process the visual content [Palmer et al. 2011].
Results from our preliminary study (Section 3.2) reveal that visual
characteristics have a complex, and non-monotonic relationship
with processing difficulty of the stimulus. The effects are also, to
some extent, naturally uncertain due to motor/neural noise and
individual variances.

These results motivate us to model 𝜈 as a function of contrast (𝑐),
frequency (𝑓 ), and eccentricity (𝑒) of the target stimulus—some of the
most important features which affect our perception of visual stimuli.
The decoupled nature of the task and visual parameters, therefore,
allow for modular computation of each parameter independently
to derive a saccade-tailored decision latency expression 𝑇𝑠𝑎𝑐 from

Fig. 4. Visualization of our stochastical model. The x-/y-axis indicates
time/perceptual evidence levels. With a task-determined evidence threshold
𝛼 and the image-determined accumulation speed 𝜈, each saccade decision is
modeled as a random walk process (for instance, the pink curve). When the
evidence accumulation reaches 𝛼, a saccade is triggered. Due to cognitive
noise and individual differences, each saccadic decision may vary (as in the
light gray curves), thus forming the action timing as a probabilistic event.

and once the amount of evidence reaches a minimum threshold, a
decision/action is triggered, as visualized in Figure 4. As soon as
a decision is made, the evidence is reset, and the process restarts,
preparing for the next decision.

The process of evidence accumulation is modelled as a random
stochastic process to reflect human reaction uncertainties and incon-
sistencies. As the name of the DDM suggests, the observed evidence
is modelled as a diffusion process with non-zero drift, also known
as Brownian motion.

Integration-and-action. We represent the measure of evidence
accumulation after time 𝑡 via a stochastic process, {𝐴(𝑡; 𝜈)}𝑡 ≥0. The
process is modelled as the trajectory following Brownian motion
with mean drift rate 𝜈. Formally, the process is expressed as
𝐴(0; 𝜈) = 0,
𝐴(𝑡; 𝜈) = 𝜈𝑡 + 𝑊 (𝑡)
𝑊 (𝑡) ∼ G(0, 𝑡),

(1)

where G is the Gaussian distribution.

As illustrated in Figure 4, at the beginning of a decision-making
process, no evidence has been accumulated to affect the confi-
dence of reaching a decision. Therefore, the initial evidence amount,
𝐴(0; 𝜈), equals to zero. As time, 𝑡, progresses, confidence builds
up with a mean rate of 𝜈, while also accumulating noise propor-
tional to 𝑡, due to various uncertainties in the process of evidence
accumulation.

The distribution of evidence, 𝐴(𝑡; 𝜈), at a given point in time, 𝑡,

can be simplified and expressed as a Gaussian distribution,

𝐴(𝑡; 𝜈) ∼ G(𝜈𝑡, 𝑡).
However, we aim to characterize the distribution of the latency when
enough evidence is collected to trigger a decision. More concretely,
we seek to find the distribution of the earliest time, 𝑇 (𝛼; 𝜈), when
the integrated evidence reaches a given threshold, 𝛼:

In the following sections, we determine how to obtain the analytical
forms of 𝛼 (𝐷) and 𝜈 (𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒) respectively by leveraging our collected
data. Further, note that, as intuitively visualized in Figure 4, 𝜈 already
universally determines the relative proportion between the mean
and variance of latencies. It depends on the stimuli characteristics,
and together with task-dependent 𝛼 that determines the absolute
time.

4.3 Measuring Evidence Threshold 𝛼 in eq. (6)
To fit our model to the pilot user study data from Section 3, we need
to compute 𝛼 for the task 𝐷𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑡 , and also fit a function which maps
(𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒) values to corresponding 𝜈 values.

Since our model is built with a single task description, denoted as
𝐷𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑡 , and is kept invariant throughout the entire study, we only
evaluate a single value of 𝛼. We leverage how the mean, E, and
variance, V of the IG distribution relate to its 𝛼 parameter to derive
an estimation given a sample of saccade latency 𝑇𝑠𝑎𝑐 (𝐷𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑜𝑡 , · ),

Note that 𝛼 only depends on the task but not the stimuli. Therefore,
we can choose any (𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒) in order to compute a 𝛼. Extending
the model from the pilot study task to novel tasks (e.g., stimulus
comparison) only requires a calibration via Equation (7) using a
sample drawn from the novel task.

4.4 Learning Evidence Integration Rate 𝜈 in eq. (6)
With the task-calibrated 𝛼, we optimize the evidence integration
rate, 𝜈 via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) given a combi-
nation of stimulus’ contrast, frequency, and eccentricity, {𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒}.
Note that since the task description, 𝐷, does not correlate with 𝜈,
the learned result is applicable to any arbitrary scenario and task.
Mathematically, we formulate 𝜈 as a function of {𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒}. To ensure
local smoothness of the desired function within this input domain,
we model the function as a Radial Basis Function Neural Network
(RBFNN),

where b𝑖 indicates the individual radial basis centers, and 𝜌 is a
Gaussian Basis function. In our experiments, we choose 𝑁 = 20.
Using our collected data from Section 3, we jointly train the RBFNN’s
weights 𝜆, centers b𝑖 , and Gaussian deviations 𝜎.

We need 𝜈 label values from our user study to obtain the RBFNN
parameters. Similar to Section 4.3, we utilize the relationship be-
tween the evidence integration rate, 𝜈, and the mean, E, of the IG
distribution:

ˆ𝜈 (𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒) ∼ E[𝑇 (· , 𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒)]−1.
The proportionality constant of this relationship depends on the
unit of time measurement and is set to 1 for simplicity, and scaled
to appropriate units as necessary.

Detailed learning implementation can be referred to in Section 5.4.
The final fitted model is visualized in Figure 5. Eccentricity’s U-
shaped effects on saccadic latency can be observed.

IMPLEMENTATION
5.1 Data Normalization
While saccade latencies vary according to the trends observed in Sec-
tion 3, the absolute values measured across different individuals can
vary significantly. In order to aggregate the data efficiently without
introducing large amounts of noise caused by individual variances,
we normalize the data as a first step during analysis. Specifically,
we pick a calibration condition from all the data collected from a
single experiment block and set the mean normalized duration of
this condition equal to 1. For the pilot experiment from Section 3,
the calibration condition was 𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒 = {1.0, 1.0, 0.0}. For the dual
task experiment from Section 6.3, the calibration condition was
𝑐 𝑓 , 𝑐𝑝 = {1.0, 1.0}. For the natural task experiment from Section 6.2,
the calibration condition was the control group. The choice of all
calibration conditions are arbitrary and we validated that it does
not affect the model’s predictive ability. See Appendix B for detailed
description of normalization.

5.2 Hardware and Stimuli Generation
All user study systems were implemented in the Unity Game Engine
and run on the HTC Vive Pro Eye with specifications in Table 1. The
synthetic image datasets used in Section 6.2 are generated using
3D-assets purchased from the Unity Asset Store and rendered using
the Cycles Rendering Engine included in Blender. When evaluating
the FoVVideoVDP scores of the stimuli used in our work, we used
the authors’ open-source implementations which provided configu-
rations for the HTC Vive Pro Eye. Some visualizations used in the
demo video were created using the Manim Mathematical Animation
Framework [2022].

5.3 Saccadic Latency Detection
Our method of detecting reaction times for saccadic events is mea-
sured by the time of onset of the “primary” saccade that is used to
move the gaze to the target location. We define the “primary” sac-
cade as the saccade that is onset and offset within 3◦ of the intended
gaze origin and target locations respectively. For saccade detection
we use the method presented by Engbert and Mergenthaler [2006].
Note that this saccade detection algorithm is not just limited to
microsaccade detection as the title might suggest, and has been used
by Lisi et al. [2019] for normal saccade detection.

Integration Rate Learning

5.4
To train the rate parameter, 𝜈 in Section 4.4, we train a Radial Basis
Function Neural Network (as formulated in Equation (8)) imple-
mented using the auto-differentiation library, Pytorch. We use the
Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.1. The training used 2000
epochs and took ∼ 180 seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.

6 EVALUATION
We gauge the ability of our model to generalize and consider possible
applications via a series of psychophysical and simulated experi-
ments. In Section 6.1, we first measure robustness and generaliz-
ability using data collected in Section 3. Next, in Section 6.2 we
provide three example tasks featuring complex stimuli (athletics,
esports, and photographic scenes), and compare the model’s predic-
tions with our user study data. In Section 6.3, we evaluate how our
model extends to more sophisticated tasks containing multiple stim-
uli of interest. Finally, we present two possible applications of our
model: evaluating esports competition fairness, and estimating how
human-display configuration can alter in-game target searching
performance in Section 7.

6.1 Model Performance and Generalizability
We present an analytical model whose parameters are learned based
on user-collected data. Thus, we need to evaluate our model’s per-
formance regarding both prediction accuracy and generalizability
beyond the specific trials and subjects included in the training data.
To this end, we perform a comparative analysis of alternate training
and testing partitions of the dataset.

Protocol. For each analysis, we reserve a different partition of the
dataset from Section 3 for testing, re-train the model in the same
way as in Sections 4.3 and 4.4, and then measure the accuracy of the

observations across various partitioning protocols. The results of
the randomly partitioned study (1) demonstrate the generalizability
of our model across trials without observed overfitting. Analysis of
the subject-partitioned study (2) verifies our model’s applicability
to unseen users, and thus general human saccadic behaviors.

We further performed an ablation study with individual visual
characteristic conditions ({𝑐, 𝑓 , 𝑒}) provided in Appendix F. It com-
pares each condition’s contribution to our model by training an
ablated version of the model with various conditions of the dataset
missing, and quantifying the size of the regression in the model’s pre-
dictive ability. The results show that across ablation conditions, the
Mean Squared Error (MSE) between ground truth and our model’s
prediction regresses by 50% on average.

6.2 Predicting Saccadic Behaviors with Altered Target

Appearances in Natural Tasks

In Section 3, we observed that unnoticeably subtle visual changes
may induce significantly varied reactive latencies, as was formulated
and predicted by our model in Section 4. In this experiment, we
evaluate our model’s application in several realistic target search
scenarios such as esports, and real-world photographs.

Via a series of psychophysical studies, we seek to determine: (1)
whether our model can extend to predicting saccadic reaction la-
tencies with natural task/stimuli; (2) whether we can imperceptibly
alter the appearance of objects while still introducing enough reac-
tive latency to materially influence real-world task performance. We
answer these queries in our experiment and compare our findings
to the model predictions.

Participants and setup. We recruited 14 participants (ages 22 − 33,
3 female) for this series of 2AFC experiments. Two participants
were excluded for inability to perform the tasks (self-reported diffi-
culty perceiving peripheral stimuli and target identification accuracy
greater than one standard deviation below the mean), resulting in
12 final participants. Two of the 12 participated in the preliminary
study in Section 3. The study was conducted during a 10-minute
sessions consisting of 153 trials per scene for each participant. The
hardware and setup remain the same as in Section 3.

Scenes and stimuli. To simulate a broad range of applications,
our user study stimuli consisted of three groups of images: (1) a
synthetic soccer scene, (2) a synthetic first-person view as an analog
for esports, and (3) digital photographs of an indoor shelf. Each
group contained 51 different images; each has the target stimuli
appearing at different locations (to avoid learning effects) on the
visual field, and serve as a trial. The background and targets from
each evaluation group are shown in Figure 7. Although shown in
color in the paper for visual clarity, all images were rendered with
grayscale on display to avoid bias from color cues.

Tasks. Participants were instructed to complete a similar 2AFC
decision task across all trial. At the beginning of each trial, they
were shown a background image containing several task-irrelevant
objects. After a randomized 1 − 1.5 second delay, an additional task-
relevant stimulus, either a target or non-target, appeared on the
scene as in Figure 7. Participants were shown both types of stimuli
ahead of the experiment. The task was to saccade to targets, or

re-trained model prediction on the reserved test data. We perform
two types of partitioning protocols for reserving the test set:

(1) Random: a random selection drawn from all data points (20%),
(2) Subject: all data from each individual subject (20%).

Metrics and results. We perform the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K.S.)
goodness-of-fit test between the reserved test data and our predic-
tion [Massey Jr 1951], and show the Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot
[Gnanadesikan and Wilk 1968] in Figure 6. A significant difference
on the K.S. test indicates a rejection of the null hypothesis that the
sampled data is drawn from the same distribution; failing to reject
the null hypothesis supports the accuracy and generalizability of
our model. The Q-Q plot visualizes the correspondence of two prob-
ability distributions at each quantile. . Data below the 𝑦 = 𝑥 line in
Figure 6 indicate an overestimation of saccade latencies and vice
versa for data above the line.

Figure 6 shows the Q-Q plot for the training and testing sets
across both partition protocols. The K.S. test fails to reject the null
hypothesis that the observed user saccade latency distribution is
drawn from our model-predicted distribution for (1) the random
partition, 𝐷 = .2, 𝑝 = .99, and (2) the individual subject partitions:

remain fixated if the stimulus was identified as a non-target. This
procedure allows us to measure the visual-oculomotor latency after
which a subject identifies the discernible feature of interest from the
stimulus. This emulates the common real-world scenarios where a
new “intruder” of potential interest enters the subjects’ visual fields.
Please refer to our video for dynamic illustrations of the task.

Conditions. Across each image set, we tested three variations of
the target stimulus in order to measure how changes in image fea-
tures affect saccade latencies. In one variation the target stimulus
had increased contrast and/or decreased frequency (Accelerated),
in another variation the target had decreased contrast and/or in-
creased frequency (Deferred), and a third unfiltered variation was
used as a control group (Control). Each participant performed 51
images × 3 conditions × 3 scenes, resulting in 459 trials total, i.e.,

5508 trials across the experiment. Measuring the precise frequen-
cies affecting saccade latency is a complex task requiring pooling
from multiband. Investigating a comprehensive pooling strategy
is beyond the scope of this work. Therefore, we approximate the
representative frequency as the Laplacian pyramid layer with the
highest corresponding contrast, for those images without a uniform
frequency pattern. Contrast and eccentricity computations were
trivial to compute without requiring pooling operations.

Results. We present the results of our experiments in Figure 7.
We again use the K.S. statistical test to evaluate alignment between
predicted and measured histograms across the different scenes for
each condition. We report the results of these tests below:

Please refer to Appendix G for the collected saccadic latency distri-
butions of individual participants and scenes.

Using the Control images as reference, we additionally calculate
the FovVideoVDP values for all images in our dataset. We find the
mean values to be above 9.5 for all Accelerated/Deferred images,
which indicates observers would be approximately at chance for
detecting differences between them.

We also debriefed each participant after the experiment on their
thoughts regarding the tasks, and most participants reported no
self-awareness of reaction time difference.

Discussion. Our results demonstrate agreement between the pre-
dictions made by our model and the observed saccadic latency dis-
tributions across 12 participants. We find significant differences
in saccadic latency across conditions, despite identical perceptual
appearance evidenced by the FovVideoVDP metrics.

Our prediction of the photographic scene results show correct
trends and distribution ratios, albeit for a scaled absolute time (in
ms) relative to the measured data. We attribute this scale variance
to the fact that natural images contain wide frequency bands and
our single-frequency pooling in the Laplacian Pyramid may discard
significant frequency information. This motivates interesting future
work on multi-frequency pooling models tailored for reaction time,
see Section 8.

6.3 Extending to Foveal-Peripheral Dual Tasks
In various real-world scenarios, humans perform tasks by jointly
analyzing both foveal and peripheral content, such as with reading,
film watching, and architectural design. In this experiment, we
extend and evaluate our model to such applications considering
dual tasks.

Modeling. Our visual system processes foveal and peripheral stim-
uli independently and in parallel for a variety of tasks [Ludwig et al.
2014]. That is, the foveal and peripheral pathways gather informa-
tion concurrently, and the decision to trigger a saccade waits until
both processes have finished. We hypothesize that these indepen-
dent foveal and peripheral stimulus processing units operate using
the integration-and-action process as described in Section 4.1.

In this model, processing times for both the fovea, 𝑇𝑓 , and pe-
riphery, 𝑇𝑝 , follow Equation (4), and can be adapted to specific task
descriptions and stimulus characteristics as shown in Equation (6):
𝑇𝑓 ∼ IG(𝛼 𝑓 , 𝜈 𝑓 )
𝑇𝑝 ∼ IG(𝛼𝑝, 𝜈𝑝 ),

(10)

where we create some shorthands for convenience:
𝛼 𝑓 = 𝛼 (𝐷 𝑓 ), 𝜈 𝑓 = 𝜈 (𝑐 𝑓 , 𝑓𝑓 , 𝑒𝑓 = 0◦)
𝛼𝑝 = 𝛼 (𝐷𝑝 ), 𝜈𝑝 = 𝜈 (𝑐𝑝, 𝑓𝑝, 𝑒𝑝 = 10◦).

(11)

Image Features Influence Reaction Time

•

144:11

𝑒𝑝 = 10◦ because the peripheral stimulus for this experiment was at
10◦ eccentricity. Then, as experimentally determined by prior litera-
ture on similar tasks [Ludwig et al. 2014], we model the total saccade
latency as the maximum value of these two random variables:

𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 = max(𝑇𝑓 ,𝑇𝑝 ).

Setup. To evaluate our hypothetical model for dual tasks, we con-
ducted a user study to measure how saccade latency changes as
we modulate foveal and peripheral stimuli independently. Unfortu-
nately, it is not possible to explicitly compute the 𝛼 𝑓 and 𝛼𝑝 values
as in Equation (7), because a user study for the dual task can only
sample the total saccade latency from Equation (12). That is, the
individual distributions, 𝑇𝑓 , and 𝑇𝑝 are not measured directly. Since
finding these threshold values directly is not possible, we infer them
via maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of the overall distribution
of 𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 , given a dataset of size 𝑛:

𝛼 𝑓 , 𝛼𝑝 = arg max

𝑛
∑︁

𝑖

log 𝐿(𝛼 𝑓 , 𝛼𝑝 ; 𝑡 (𝑖), 𝜈 𝑓 , 𝜈𝑝 ).

(13)

Please refer to Appendix C for the derivation of the likelihood
function for 𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 . The hardware setup in this experiment is the
same as described in Table 1.

Participants. We recruited 𝑛 = 12 participants (ages 22-33, 3 fe-
male) with normal or corrected to normal vision for a series of 2AFC
experiments. The study was conducted during a single 10 minute
session, including a total of 240 trials for each participant.

Stimuli and Tasks. At the beginning of each trial participants are
shown three Gabor patches as illustrated in Figure 8a: one at the
fovea, and two in the left and right peripheries at equal eccentrici-
ties of 10◦. The foveal Gabor is tilted either 45◦ or −45◦ from the
vertical axis; with chance probability, one of the peripheral Gabors
is selected to have the same tilt as the foveal Gabor, while the other
has the opposite tilt. The task is to identify and saccade to the pe-
ripheral Gabor of the same orientation as the foveal Gabor. For
each trial, the central and peripheral Gabor contrast values are sam-
pled from [0.05, 0.22, 0.53, 1.0], drawn independently. That is, taking
all combinations of central-peripheral Gabor contrast possibilities
yields a total of 16 conditions. The frequency of all Gabors was fixed
to 2.0 cpd (cycles-per-degree). Each participant also performed 15
randomly ordered practice trials before the start of the experiment.

Results. In Figure 8c, we show the relationship of both foveal and
peripheral contrasts with saccade latency, as well as the ground
truth data collected from our user study overlaid on top of the
surface plot. The MLE regression produces threshold values of 𝛼 𝑓 =
3.21 and 𝛼𝑝 = 3.56. Hence, the threshold ratio between the foveal
and peripheral components is 1 : 1.04. Similar to Section 6.1, we
present the Q-Q plot comparing the data to our model predictions
in Figure 8d. The K.S. statistical test again fails to reject the null
hypothesis that the observed user saccadic latencies are drawn from
our 𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 −predicted distribution (𝐷 = 0.1 and 𝑝 = 1.0).

Models which consider only the peripheral contrast (shown in
Figure 8b), or only the foveal contrast fail to accurately predict the
saccade latencies. We run the K.S. test for both of these conditions
and observe a significant difference between the data and the model

predictions: 𝐷 = 0.9 and 𝑝 = 0.002 for the foveal-only model, and
𝐷 = 0.8 and 𝑝 = 0.002 for the periphery-only model.

Discussion. When humans perform tasks involving both foveal
and peripheral analysis, we observe that a models considering only
one eccentricity fails to predict saccade latencies, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 8d and demonstrated by the K.S. tests. By comparison, the joint
model we propose in Equation (12), inspired by prior discoveries on
visual mechanisms, successfully predicts the latency distribution.

7 APPLICATION CASE STUDY: ESPORTS FAIRNESS
METRIC AND PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

A major application of our model is to measure and optimize human
performance in competitive, real-time, or time-sensitive tasks such
as defense, piloting, and esports. In this evaluation, we use esports
as an example. In real-world professional gameplay, we deploy our
model to: 1) measure game fairness in terms of character skin design
that triggers varied gaze motion performance between two teams; 2)
measure and optimize the human target search performance under
various screen resolutions, eye-display distances, and compare the
performance with traditional and immersive displays.

Data. We collected professional replay videos from a popular
esports game, Counter-Strike: Global Offense via YouTube. The
data contains a ≈ half hour long video footage where we uniformly
sampled 95 frames from beginning to the end. For each frame, we
exploit the virtual human tracking model YoLO [2016] that predicts
the team ID (Counter-Terrorist, CT and Terrorist TR), and bounding
boxes. We assume the observers gaze lies in the middle of the screen,
and apply our model to predict the time when the viewer reorients
their gaze to each target. We measure the visual characteristics with
a common display setting: a Samsung 32inch CH32H711 monitor,
2K 16:9 resolution, 70cm width, 300cd/𝑚2 brightness, and ≈ 1.33D
(diopter = m−1) eye-display distance (50◦ FoV).

7.1 Competition Fairness in Target Searching
The game has two opposing teams of characters. Regardless of game
task design and differences in tools, game fairness is an important
concern in esports [Chen et al. 2014]. Using our model and the de-
tected targets, we measure the average saccade latency of individual
groups.

Figure 9b shows the results. We observed a significant difference
between CT and TR groups: the average normalized latencies are
0.92 ± 0.02 for searching CTs and 0.95 ± 0.04 for searching TRs,
indicating a 3.3% difference. Given previous literature indicating the
mean saccade latency for CS:GO professional players to be about
282ms [Velichkovsky et al. 2019], 3.3% results in a 9.3ms reaction
variance. One-way repeated measures ANOVA showed the group’s
significant main effect on the saccadic latency, 𝐹1,93 = 11.4, 𝑝 = .001.
The results demonstrate a statistically significant difference be-
tween the two groups, in terms of them perceiving, processing,
and reacting to appeared targets. That is, a TR/CT saccading to
the other group is significantly faster/slower with no less than 2/1
frames on a 60/120FPS displays. The speed difference is remarkably
higher than the minimum latency, as low as 4ms, that leads to al-
tered esport performance among top-level competitors [Kim et al.
2019]. While this may have been one of the factors that contributed
to the imbalanced competitive game performance (higher winning
rate of TR on the map we analyzed) between these two groups 1, in
practice the asymmetric weapon and task designs might also have
played a role.

7.2 Optimizing Player Performance
A natural and extensively asked question is the role of eye-display
distance (e.g., regular monitors vs. VR displays) and screen resolu-
tion in professional competitions. Using our model, we measure the

dataset as Section 7.

Figure 9c visualizes our results by observing the altered reaction
performance. As before, we use the mean saccade latency for CS:GO
professional players to be about 282ms [Velichkovsky et al. 2019].
First, both teams are not at their best performance with the initial
1.33D eye-display distance, with the faster reaction of TRs search-
ing CTs. However, the teams reveal different trends by changing
the eye’s distance (thus FoV), which jointly alters target eccentricity
(𝑒) and frequency (𝑓 ) (cf. Appendix D). Particularly, the minimal
saccade latency towards CT targets is 273.5ms at 34.6◦ FoV (0.9D
eye-display distance). In comparison, the minimal latency towards
TR targets is 266.1ms at 61.5◦ FoV (1.6D eye-display distance). The
two curves intersect at 1.69D with an identical latency of 266.3ms.
We further simulate real-world use cases with different displays
(for instance, gaming with mobile devices or training with VR dis-
plays). In this experiment, we use the measures from the iPhone 13
(5.78 × 2.53 inches) with the commonly suggested 30cm (or 3.3D)
eye-display distance, leading to a 25.7◦ FoV. Under this circum-
stances, the saccade time to TR becomes higher than CT (324.3ms
vs 259.4ms) Similarly, the measurement with our virtual reality
HMD (90◦ overlapped FoV), the relative trend is swapped: saccading
to a TR becomes shorter than to a CT, with a 21.2ms difference
(276.0ms vs 288.0ms).

The above analysis indicates the sensitivity of eye display correla-
tion in determining performance and fairness in time-sensitive and
competitive scenarios. Surprisingly, the statistical performance bias
may swap with different eye-display relationships. For instance, with
a mobile/VR setting, the visual stimuli may bias with TR/CT play-
ers in terms of reaction performance. In addition to the commonly
referred measurement of visual similarity and task/map fairness,
our model presents a novel perspective in competitive and highly
dynamic scenario design, such as athletics, esports and defense.

8 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In our model, we consider a variety of factors which affect visual
stimuli – contrast, frequency, eccentricity – in the context of sev-
eral display environments (from mobile devices to VR displays).
However, a multitude of other factors may affect reaction time to
observed natural stimuli in the complex natural world. For instance,
making a cognitive decision among multiple potential targets may
depend on higher-level visual salience [Jarvenpaa 1990] and object
sizes [Lisi et al. 2019] whereas our model assumes pre-knowledge
of the intended saccade target. While our work showed promising
results for one foveal and one peripheral task, we cannot easily
extrapolate our results for significantly more complex tasks. In ad-
dition, we rely on a single max-pooling of image frequencies using
the highest contrast layer of the Laplacian pyramid (Section 6.2) for
model application in natural images. This may introduce an approx-
imation error, especially with complex and noisy natural images
(Figure 7c). Using an approach similar to Mantiuk et al. [2021] and
fitting a pooling model to user data collected from natural image
stimuli would be a useful direction of future work. To avoid any
bias introduced by color, we convert stimuli to gray-scale for the

psychophysical experiments. We leave the task of creating a multi-
band and color-aware model tailored for measuring reactive latency
for future work. Our model also does not consider scenarios where
motion [Jindal et al. 2021] and refresh rates [Krajancich et al. 2021]
may play a critical role, especially during saccades [Schweitzer and
Rolfs 2021]. We aim to extend our model to consider spatio-temporal
effects and complex dynamic scenarios in the future.

9 CONCLUSION
We demonstrated a significant difference between human visual
acuity (observation of a stimulus) and reaction latency (process-
ing after the observation). We formulated this behavior using a
neurologically-inspired probabilistic model that is motivated and
evaluated by a series of psychophysical studies. The surprising gap
we observe between observation and reaction raised new, previ-
ously unasked questions such as, “Are competitive digital activities
such as esports fair among teams, given the design of their appear-
ances?”, “How do human-display-content relationships alter our
performance in virtual environments?”, and “What settings optimize
reaction time without compromising visual content?”. We hope that
our model’s answers to these questions inspire researchers to ex-
plore new avenues in interactive computer graphics and immersive
virtual environments.

A DERIVING Equation (5)
For a Brownian motion process as described by Equation (1),

𝐴(0; 𝜈) = 0,
𝐴(𝑡; 𝜈) = 𝜈𝑡 + 𝑊 (𝑡)
𝑊 (𝑡) ∼ G(0, 𝑡),
the joint probability distribution of an evidence value 𝑎 observed at
time 𝑡 is described by the Fokker-Plank equation:

(14)

(cid:40)𝑝 (0, 𝑎) = 𝛿 (𝑎)
𝑝 (𝑡, 𝛼) = 0
where 𝑝 is the probability density function of particles behaving
according to Equation (1), and 𝛿 is the Dirac delta function. The
solution to the boundary value problem described by Equation (14),
with boundary conditions of Equation (15), is

(15)

(16)

This probability density function describes the joint probability of
observing any given pair of time 𝑡 and evidence 𝑎. Using this density
function, we first compute the probability of the evidence being
below the threshold, 𝛼. For the distribution of first passage time, 𝑇 ,
this probability is equivalent to the survival function. I.e.,

𝑆 (𝑡) = 𝑃 (𝑇 > 𝑡) =

B DATA NORMALIZATION PSEUDO-CODE
We describe the normalization and calibration procedures applied
that are necessary for optimizing and subsequently using the model
for novel applications.

Require: pilot study data

1: pick a pedestal condition (e.g. 𝑐 = 1.0, 𝑓 = 1.0, 𝑒 = 0◦)
2: for each subject do
3:

compute the average latency of pedestal condition, 𝑡pedestal
scale all latencies by 1/𝑡pedestal

4:
5: end for
6: train RBF network for computing 𝜈 in normalized units
7: return normalized 𝜈 predictor.

•

144:i

Once we obtain an optimized 𝜈 predictor, we apply the model to

a novel application as follows:

Require: target application sample data
1: measure the E and V of the latency
2: compute 𝛼 for data using eq. (7)
3: rescale 𝜈 by E of the data
4: return probability distribution described by 𝛼 and rescaled 𝜈.
Algorithm 2. Calibration.

Due to the inverse correlation between the step 4 in Alg. 1 and
the step 3 in Alg. 2, any selection of condition in step 1 of Alg. 1
does not lose the generality.

C DERIVING Equation (13)
We are interested in deriving an expression for the probability dis-
tribution function for 𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 as shown in Equation (12).

𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 = max(𝑇𝑓 ,𝑇𝑝 ).

We know that both 𝑇𝑓 and 𝑇𝑝 are Inverse Gaussian (IG) random
variables as detailed in Equation (10),

𝑇𝑓 ∼ IG(𝛼 𝑓 , 𝜈 𝑓 )
𝑇𝑝 ∼ IG(𝛼𝑝, 𝜈𝑝 ).

The probability that 𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 is less than some time 𝑡 is equivalent to
the statement that both 𝑇𝑓 and 𝑇𝑝 are less than 𝑡. I.e.,

where 𝐻𝑓 denotes the cumulative density function (CDF) of the
IG distribution with parameters 𝛼 𝑓 and 𝜈 𝑓 , and vice versa for 𝐻𝑝 .
The probability density function of 𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 is therefore equal to the
derivative of 𝐻𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 .

Taking the derivative from Equation (21) we get,

ℎ𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 (𝑡) = ℎ𝑓 (𝑡)𝐻𝑝 (𝑡) + 𝐻𝑓 (𝑡)ℎ𝑝 (𝑡).

(22)

Since we have an explicit expression for the PDF of 𝑇𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 , we can
finally write down an expression for the likelihood function from
Equation (13) as

𝐿(𝛼 𝑓 , 𝛼𝑝 ; 𝑡, 𝜈 𝑓 , 𝜈𝑝 ) = ℎ (𝑡; 𝛼 𝑓 , 𝜈 𝑓 )𝐻 (𝑡; 𝛼𝑝, 𝜈𝑝 )+
+ 𝐻 (𝑡; 𝛼 𝑓 , 𝜈 𝑓 )ℎ (𝑡; 𝛼𝑝, 𝜈𝑝 ),

(23)

where ℎ and 𝐻 are the PDF, and CDF functions of the IG distribution.

D FIELD-OF-VIEW VS ECCENTRICITY & FREQUENCY
The observed image characteristics of stimuli shown on a display
vary depending on how far the display is from the eye. We correlate
these effects using the field-of-view that the display occupies as a
measure of eye-distance. FoV is an intuitive way to measure eye-
distance as it can be used regardless of the specific dimensions of a
given display.

Given a display with width 𝑤, presented at an FoV of 𝜃fov, the

distance of the display equals

𝑑 =

𝑤/2
tan(𝜃fov/2)

.

(24)

If an observer is staring at the center of the display at FoV of 𝜃fov
(or equivalently at a distance of 𝑑), an object 𝑥cm away from the
center of the display will appear at

retinal eccentricity. Hence, we notice that changing the eye-distance
of a display alters the eccentricity at which stimuli appear in the
retina.

Additionally, we can use this relation to derive a rate-of-change
coefficient between physical distances (in cm), and retinal eccentrit-
icies (in degrees) by taking the derivative of eq. (25),

This measure of “degrees-per-distance” allows us to derive the
relationship between the spatial frequency of a pattern shown on the
screen, 𝑓display (in cycles-per-centimeter), and the retinal frequency
that an observer perceives, 𝑓retina (in cycles-per-degrees),

𝑓retina = 𝑓display

cos2 𝜃
Note that the observed frequency not only depends on the FoV,
but also the eccentricity at which the stimulus is shown. For the
simplest case where the stimulus is at the center of the screen, or
𝜃 = 0, the relationship simplifies to

𝑤/2
tan(𝜃fov/2)

Fig. 11. Ablation study plots when any single condition is removed (as described in Section 6.1) from the training dataset where eccentricity 𝑒 = 0◦. By
observing the corresponding model performance drop (i.e., stronger misaligment with the 𝑦 = 𝑥 line), we visualize individual visual characteristic condition’s
contribution to the model. We observe that the distribution of latencies for some conditions cause a larger regression in the model’s performance, such as
the conditions (𝑐 = 0.05, 𝑓 = 0.5, 𝑒 = 0◦) and (𝑐 = 0.05, 𝑓 = 4.0, 𝑒 = 0◦). These regressions are caused by the fact that the model strongly relies on the data
we collected for these specific conditions. Meanwhile, when conditions, such as (𝑐 = 0.53, 𝑓 = 1.0, 𝑒 = 0◦, are removed for ablation the model is able to
successfully interpolate their predictions, due to the abundance of neighbor conditions. To quantify the sizes of the regressions, we compute the MSE of
ablated models against the ground truth data, and compare how much the error increased/decreased when compared to the full model. On average, the MSE
of the ablated model regresses by as much as 50% when compared to the full model. However, the regression in performance is largely attributed by a few
conditions which we mentioned above with the condition (𝑐 = 0.05, 𝑓 = 4.0, 𝑒 = 0◦) exhibiting a 1100% increase in error. If we discount the extreme conditions,
we observe that the median MSE regression is equal to 7%.
