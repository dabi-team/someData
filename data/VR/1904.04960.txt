Abstract

Along with the development of virtual reality (VR), om-
nidirectional images play an important role in producing
multimedia content with immersive experience. However,
despite various existing approaches for omnidirectional im-
age stitching, how to quantitatively assess the quality of
stitched images is still insufﬁciently explored. To address
this problem, we establish a novel omnidirectional image
dataset containing stitched images as well as dual-ﬁsheye
images captured from standard quarters of 0◦, 90◦, 180◦
and 270◦. In this manner, when evaluating the quality of an
image stitched from a pair of ﬁsheye images (e.g., 0◦ and
180◦), the other pair of ﬁsheye images (e.g., 90◦ and 270◦)
can be used as the cross-reference to provide ground-truth
observations of the stitching regions. Based on this dataset,
we further benchmark six widely used stitching models with
seven evaluation metrics for IQA. To the best of our knowl-
edge, it is the ﬁrst dataset that focuses on assessing the
stitching quality of omnidirectional images.

1. Introduction

With the rapid development of immersive multimedia
content in virtual reality (VR), high-quality omnidirectional
images are required to provide a natural immersions of real-
world scenarios in head-mounted displays. Along with the
boost of stitching methods, there exists a huge demand
of the automatic quality assessment of stitched omnidi-
rectional images. Actually, the quantitative assessment of
stitching quality will be of a great help in the development
of VR equipment and computer-aided 3D modeling [1].

Many image quality assessment (IQA) methods [17, 9,
12, 4, 18] have been proposed d in the past decades. These
IQA researches have gain large successes in common im-
ages. Considering the image categories they focuses on,
these models can be roughly divided into two categories.
The ﬁrst category mainly focuses on the assessment of com-

Figure 1. Motivation of cross-reference stitching quality assess-
ment. We establish a cross-reference omnidirectional dataset with
quadruple ﬁsheye images captured at 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees. Tak-
ing two images in opposite directions for stitching, the other two
images can provide high-quality ground-truth references (green
boxes) to assess the stitched low-quality regions (red boxes).

mon daily images. Along with the denoising and deblurring
techniques, many commonly used indexes such as MSE
[25], PSNR [21] and SSIM [23] have been widely used to
evaluate the quality of the generated images. Some other
studies [2, 10] also use the deep models as the evaluation
metric to learn the assessment model automatically. For
example, Kang et al. [10] proposed a compact multi-task
convolutional neural network for simultaneously estimating
image quality and identifying distortions. Liu et al. [12]
further proposed a non-reference image quality assessment
with the ranking model of Siamese Network. However,
these models usually focuses on the photometric quality in-
dexes such as blurring, noise and color distortions, which
may be not suitable for the omnidirectional stitched images.
The second category of the IQA models mainly focuses
on the stitched images, which can also be used, more or less,
to evaluate the omnidirectional images. In recent years, few
studies have explored this less-explored task. For examples,
Yang et al. [4] proposed a light-weight model to evaluate
the stitched panoramic images based on ghosting and struc-

ture inconsistency. However, this proposed metric is de-
signed of normal 2-D plane image stitching, while the dual-
ﬁsheye images for generating 360◦ omnidirectional images
face large distortion and information loss in the bound-
ary areas. Duan et al. [5] established an omnidirectional
IQA dataset collected with four main distortions of 320 im-
ages and proposed a subjective method to assess the image
quality. However, this method may have difﬁculties to get
the perfect ground-truth in the stitching areas even with a
labour-consuming calibration.

To tackle these challenges, we mainly address our con-
cerns in the proposed dataset and models. To get the
high-quality ground-truth reference for the stitched regions,
we resort to the cross-reference dataset establishment. As
shown in Fig. 1, cross-reference is implemented within
overlapping region of two wide-angle images for stitching.
Taking four ﬁsheye images along a circle, the two images
of 0◦ and 180◦ are stitched into an omnidirectional image.
During stitching, geometry deformation occurs in the region
of stitching, so the stitching results of the other two images
of 90◦ and 270◦ can provide high-quality ground-truth ref-
erences for measuring such a deformation. To the best of
our knowledge, we establish the ﬁrst cross-reference omni-
directional image dataset which contains 292 quaternions of
ﬁsheye images as well as the stitched images generated by
seven methods.

2. Related Work

Many IQA methods have been proposed in the past
decades, which can be roughly grouped into three cate-
gories. Some pioneer works for image IQA [2, 9, 19]
focuses on both traditional IQA and common panoramic
stitching IQA. In this paper, we mainly focuses on the
quality assessment omnidirectional images, which is a less-
explored task with increasingly demands.

For the quality evaluation of stitched images, the related
research results are relatively few. For example, Yang et
al. [4] solved the problem of ghosting and structural dis-
continuity in image stitching by using perceptual geometric
error metric and local structure-guide metric, but for im-
mersed image, the evaluation method is not comprehensive
enough to detect the global chromatic aberration, and the
conditions of blind zone. Huang et al. [8] proposed the
quality evaluation of immersed images, mainly focusing on
resolution and compression, neither the quality evaluation
of stitching, nor on the image quality evaluation. In [11] the
authors using convolutional sparse coding and compound
feature selection which foucs on the stitching region for
stitched image assessment.

There are some existing dataset for panoramic images.
For example, Xiao et al. [24] proposed a SUN360 panorama
database covering 360x180 full view for a large variety of
environmental scenes, places and the objects within. How-

ever, to the best of our knowledge, the lack of research re-
sults on immersed stitching IQA datasets with dual ﬁsh-
eye images, to a certain extent, also restricts the related
research development.
In the traditional IQA, the exist-
ing datasets include LIVE [20] and JPEG2000 [16] dataset.
While the dataset for stitching image quality evaluation in-
cludes SIQA [4], but these mentioned datasets are not suit-
able for research requirements of 360 × 180 degree omni-
directional image stitching quality assessment. To this end,
we propose a novel OS-IQA database, looking forward to
addressing the absence which is convenient to the subse-
quent study by researchers.

3. The Cross-reference Dataset

3.1. Omnidirectional Dataset Collection

To address the absence of omnidirectional stitching IQA
dataset, we introduce a novel Cross-Reference Omnidirec-
tional Stitching IQA dataset (CROSS). We use a set of Sam-
Sung gear 360 ﬁsheye camera to capture data in various
conditions to enhance the robustness. The proposed dataset
is composed of images in 12 various scenarios, which can
be further concluded into two families: 1) Indoor : meet-
ing room, class room, stairs, underground park, dance room,
lounge, reading-room, lounge 2) Outdoor :
street, wild
area, basketball court and residential area.

Overall, the dataset contains 292 quaternions of ﬁsheye
images and the stitching results of seven methods. Some
representative examples of outdoor and indoor sceneries can
be found in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. The proposed dataset covers
many indoor and outdoor environments as well as natural
light and no-natural light conditions.

For the original ﬁsheye images, we take a highest resolu-
tion of 5792 × 2896 limited by the camera settings. For the
stitched images, the resolutions are up to the methods, as
summarized in Table 1. Note that since each scene consists
of images captured from various degrees, the synthesis area
in each stitching result contains the corresponding ground-
truth observations that are required for evaluation.

Figure 2. Outdoor scene images in the proposed CROSS datasets. Collected original ﬁsheye images are shown in the ﬁrst and third rows,
while the ground-truth omnidirectional stitching images are shown in the second and forth rows.

To this end, we advocate using the cross-reference im-
ages to evaluate the stitching quality. As shown in Fig. 3,
the center region of image B and D can serve as reference
of image A and C (and vice versa) due to the orthogonal
relationship of degrees. When evaluating the quality of the
stitched image at a degree, we call the ﬁsheye images in
orthogonal degrees as the cross-reference.

4. Stitching Quality Benchmark

4.1. State-of-the-art Stitching Methods

To further evaluate the stitching images, we randomly
select 192 quaternions from 8 different scenes from our
proposed CROSS dataset as the evaluation set. For our
learnable human guided classiﬁer, we use the rest 100 dual-
ﬁsheye image quaternions as training set. We adopt 6
widely-used state-of-the-art stitching methods to construct
our benchmark, including Samsung Gear 360 [7], Open-
Source [6], Stereoscopic Vision Projection (SVP) [13],
Isometric Projection (IP) [3] and Equidistant Projection
(EP) [11], ManMethod (Manual Method), which ﬁnally
yields 1344 stitched images in total for comparison.

The EP [11], IP [3], and SVP [13] methods are con-
ducted with different projection strategies which is a unfold-
fusion procedure in the spherical coordinates. Further more,
with the development of VR head mount equipment, Sam-
sungGear [7] proposed a model based on the fusion with

Figure 3. Cross-reference grouping. One group is consist of four
images with different camera angles. The ref-0 is short for refer-
ence areas in 0 degrees, and sti denotes the stitching areas. When
stitching the images of A and C, the image B and D can provide a
perfect ground-truth with less distortions.

3.2. Cross-reference Grouping

To get the highest resolution, we use a set of SamSung
gear 360 ﬁsheye camera to capture data in the form of im-
age groups. Each group consists of 4 images captured from
different orthogonal categories (0, 90, 180 270) degrees at
the same camera position. Taking two images in opposite
directions for stitching, there always exists two images can
provide ground-truth references without distortions.

(e.g., brightness and chromatism) automatically.

4.2. Human Subjective Evaluations

To make a establish of this dataset, we introduce the hu-
man subject evaluation as the groundtruth scores to mea-
sure these IQA methods. The human subject evaluation is
conducted with 12 expert participants, who evaluated these
images with a Head-Mounted Displays. To get the ranking
score of these stitching methods, we conduct the pair-wise

comparisons of every two images from a same group to get
the win-loss times as the ﬁnal score. In this manner, each
group stitched images is compared of n×(n−1)/2 times. It
cost averagely 5 ∼ 7s for one participants in each compar-
ison. This win-loss scores for every stitching methods are
adopted as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which represents
the human subjective evaluation results.

4.3. Model Benchmarking

To evaluate the effectiveness of OS-IQA methods, we
compare our methods with 7 widely-used IQA meth-
ods, including classical methods MSE [25], PSNR [21],
SSIM [22], no-reference quality assessment metrics,
BRISQ [14], NIQE [15], PIQE [17], and current method
based machine learning, CNN-IQA [9].

We ﬁrst use the 7 compared IQA methods to evaluate re-
sults of selected stitching models, which ﬁnally yields 49
scores, as shown in Table 2. To compare with these IQA
indexes, we use the ranking order (view in blue) to evaluate
these methods. The SamsungGear [7] averagely archives
best scores in stitching with minimal distortions and smooth
connections while the OpenSource method generate frac-
ture in stitching regions and color distortions.

The qualitative stitching results are shown in Fig. 5, from
which the SamsungGear [7] also generates superior results
than the other methods, which is consistent with the quanti-
tative bechmarking results.

5. Conclusions

In this paper, we ﬁrst establish a cross-reference omnidi-
rectional image dataset containing stitched images as well
as dual-ﬁsheye images with standard quarters of 0◦, 90◦,
180◦ and 270◦, which will be made publicly available for
researchers.
In this manner, each quaternion can provide
both stitching results and perfect reference groundtruth for
quality assessment. Based on this dataset, we further pro-
posed a benchmark to evaluate the state-of-the-art stitching
models, From which the Samsung Gear stitching method
shows the best performance in image quality. Based on this
dataset, we further benchmark 6 widely used stitching mod-
els with 7 evaluation IQA metrics. However, this dataset is

challenging and would be further a boost to the develop-
ment of omnidirectional stitching models. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst attempt that mainly focuses on
assessing the stitching quality of omnidirectional images.
