ABSTRACT.

We present the results of the ﬁrst two color VR observations of the Algol-
type binary system WZ Crv (12 h44m15.19s, -21d25m35.4s (2000)) which were
obtained using the remotely controlled telescope TOA-150 of Tzec Maun Ob-
servatory. We determined the moments of individual minima, the orbital pe-
riod and its derivative, the initial epoch, color indices V-R and temperature
estimates of the components. Also we noticed that the phase curve is asym-
metric: the second maximum is higher than the ﬁrst one. It indicates that
there is a spot in the photosphere of one of the stars in this system.

INTRODUCTION.

The Algol-type binary system WZ Crv had been discovered in 1936 and published
by Luyten [1] in 1937 with the number 686. Then it got the preliminary numbers
NSV 05914, EC 12416-2109 and GSC 6110.00930. The primary minimum is rather
deep. According to Luyten the brightness range is from 13.m0 to 15.m0.
In the
General Catalog of Variable Stars (Samus’ et al. [2]) the value of the period of WZ
Crv is P = 1.d78878, and the range of the brightness variations is 12.m76 – 14.m7 in
V-band. During the Edinburg-Cape Blue Object Survey (Kilkenny et al.
[3]) the
spectral classes G and F7 for the components had been determined. Two minima
timings were observed by Otero & Dubovsky [4] (CCD observations) and Locher [5]
(visual observations).

II OBSERVATIONS

. We observed the south Algol-type binary system WZ Crv (12h44m15.19s,
-21d25m35.4s) = NSV 5914 during the period from JD 2455321 to JD 2455395 using
the remotely controlled astrophysical refractor TOA-150 of Tzec Maun Observatory
(D = 150mm, F = 1100mm), located in Moorook, South Australia. This telescope
was equipped with SBIG ST-L-6K CCD camera with a ﬁlter wheel. The ﬁeld of
view is 57.5’ x 86.3’, the pixel scale is 3.37"/pixel. We observed in photometric
V-Bessel and R-Bessel ﬁlters and got 317 ﬁt points in each ﬁlter. The 120 sec
exposures were used. The images were calibrated by dark frames and ﬂat ﬁeld
frames.

To test our photometric system we observed the ﬁeld of the variable star AE
Aqr. The BVRI magnitudes in standard bands of 228 stars in the vicinity of AE
Aqr were determined by Henden [6]. We used 93 most bright stars and determined
the color transformation coeﬃcients:
d(Ri − R)
d(V − R)
d(Vi − V )
d(V − R)

= −0.033 ± 0.043.

= 0.015 ± 0.035;

where Ri and Vi are the magnitudes in the instrumental system, and V and R are
the standard magnitudes (by Henden). This means that our photometry system is
close to the standard one.

There is no photometry data for reference stars in the ﬁeld of WZ Crv in
AAVSO database or in any previous papers about this star. But there are SDSS
[7] photometry data in the “u, g, r, i, z” photometric system for the stars in the
vicinity of WZ Crv. We used 3 reference stars to calibrate our photometry: USNO-
A2.0 0675-12226641 (12h44m54.624s, -21d30m27.21s), USNO-A2.0 0675-12232415
(12h45m35.274s,
-
21d16m07.06s). The transformation formulae (Lupton, 2005,
[8]) were used to
i, z” data into BVR system. The information about the
convert the “u, g, r,
reference stars is given in the Table 1. Their positions and the position of the
investigated star WZ Crv are shown on the Fig. 1.

III Data analyzing.

We determined the period, the initial epoch and the values of maxima and minima
in both, V and R, bands with corresponding errors using our observations. The
software FDCN (Andronov [9, 10]) was used to compute the coeﬃcients of the
statistically optimal trigonometric polynomial ﬁt, using the least squares method,
which allows to calculate the necessary parameters and their errors estimates. The
statistically optimal degree of the trigonometric polynomial s = 9. The determined

3

values are:

P = 1.d788788 ± 0.d000033
T0 = HJD2455354.63500 ± 0.00031

minI(R) = 14.m004 ± 0.m005
minII(R) = 12.m751 ± 0.m006
MaxI(R) = 12.m588 ± 0.m005
MaxII(R) = 12.m534 ± 0.m005

minI(V ) = 14.m564 ± 0.m009
minII(V ) = 13.m052 ± 0.m010
MaxI(V ) = 12.m889 ± 0.m006
MaxII(V ) = 12.m868 ± 0.m007.

The phase curves are shown on the Fig. 2. Besides, we made the V-R phase
curve; the result is presented on the same Figure in the same scale. It shows that in
the primary minimum the temperature is lowest, and in the phase of the secondary
minimum the temperature is highest.

IV Analyzing of the Phase Curves

At the main (deeper) minimum, there is a horizontal part which is typically inter-
preted as a total eclipse of a smaller star (called “primary”) by a larger one (called
“secondary”), so during this time interval we see only a larger star. The brightness of
the star is m2 = mmin I. To determine this value, we have computed a sample mean
value of the measurements during this phase interval of assumed constant brightness
either in the ﬁlter V , or R. To determine the brightness of the eclipsed star, we
have to use the expression E0 = E1 + E2, where E0, E1 and E2 are intensities of the
binary system (both stars), primary and secondary stars, respectively. The intensi-
ties E are related to brightness (stellar magnitudes) m using the classical Pogson’s
formulae:

E
ES

= 10−0.4(m−mS ),

m − mS = −2.5 lg

E
ES

,

where ES and mS are the intensity and brightness of some calibration source. From
these expressions, one may determine the magnitude of the eclipsed primary star as

m1 = m0 − 2.5 lg (cid:0)1 − 10−0.4(m2−m0)

(cid:1)

The value of m0 is a subject of a special discussion. Sometimes the out-of-eclipse
parts of the light curve are not constant due to the “reﬂection” eﬀect (heating of
atmosphere of one star by an emission of another star) and the “ellipticity” eﬀect
(due to a tidal distortion of one or both stars). From the mathematical point of
view, these eﬀects may be modeled as a second-order trigonometric polynomial

x(φ) = C1 + C2 cos(2πφ) + C3 cos(4πφ) + C4 sin(2πφ) + C5 sin(4πφ).

The coeﬃcients C4 and C5 are close to zero for symmetric light curves. However,
for WZ Crv, the maximum at phase 0.75 is brighter than that at the opposite phase

4

0.25, so C4 is distinctly diﬀerent from zero, whereas C5 = 0 within error estimates.
Thus we decreased the number of the determined parameters to 4. The formulae
for the error estimates were presented by e.g. Andronov [9, 10]. The shape of
the secondary minimum shows a linear-like descending and ascending branch linked
with a parabola. Thus we have used the "asymptotic parabola" ﬁt (Marsakova &
Andronov [11]). Results for the brightness maxima in both ﬁlters V, R are presented
above. We estimated the smoothed brightness m0 at the phase φ = 0 of V =
12.m953 ± 0.m007 and R = 12.m634 ± 0.m004. For φ = 0.5, V = 12.m917 ± 0.m006 and
R = 12.m601 ± 0.m004. Thus the brightness of the primary is V1 = 13.m233 ± 0.m014,
R1 = 13.m000 ±0.m008 and (V −R)1 = 0.m237 ±0.m016. Similarly, we determined the
brightness of the eclipsed part of the secondary corresponding to the phase φ = 0.5:
V2e = 15.m251 ± 0.m014, R2e = 14.m824 ± 0.m054 and (V − R)2e = 0.m427 ± 0.m109.
The ratio of the intensities from the secondary to the eclipsing part is E2/E2e =
1.94 ± 0.20 and E2/E2e = 2.19 ± 0.05 for V and R. These values are the same within
their error estimates. If interpreting this ratio as the ratio of the eclipsed surfaces
(in the simplest model of zero limb darkening), one may estimate the ratio of the
radii R2/R1 = (E2/E2e)1/2 of 1.40 ± 0.07 and 1.48 ± 0.04, respectively. Theoretical
achievements are that this ratio is constant. However, the slight diﬀerence between
the ratio E2/E2e for V and R may be interpreted as a larger coeﬃcient of the limb
darkening in V as compared with that in R. This is in an agreement with results of
Al-Naimiy [12].

Using the color indices V −R, we estimated the temperatures of the primary and
secondary stars in this binary system. In the primary minimum the cooler bigger star
eclipses the hotter star. The ﬂatness of the primary minimum (Fig. 3) indicates that
in the primary minimum the eclipse is total. Thus, it is possible to determine the
approximate temperature of the ﬁrst component, using the color index V − R in the
phase of primary minimum. We determined the corresponding temperature, using
the empirical formula (Andronov & Baklanov [13]), which describes the dependence
between the color index V − R and the spectral class. There is a misprint in the
English version of the paper, the correct version is:

10000
T

= 1.948(±0.011) + 1.474(±0.019) · (V − R − 0.681).

In the total primary eclipse the value of the color index is V − R = 0.m560 ±
0.m012. Thus, the temperature of the second component is T = (5650 ± 66)K.
Using the calibration of spectral class temperatures of Allen (1973) [14] the “3-σ”
temperature “corridor” corresponds to the range of spectral classes of G2 – G6. Using
the determined color index (V − R)1 = 0.m237 ± 0.m016 for the primary component,
we estimated the temperature of ﬁrst component (7874±166)K and range of spectral
classes A6 – F1.

Assuming that the inclination of the orbit is rather close to 90◦, we determined

the lower limits for the relative radiuses of the stars, using the formulae

R1
a

R2
a

=

=

sin(πD) − sin(πd)
2

sin(πD) + sin(πd)

where R1 and R2 are the average radiuses of the stars, a is the orbital separation, i.
e. a distance between the centers of the components, d is the duration of the total
eclipse (in phases), D is the total duration of eclipse, from the beginning till the
very end (in phases too). The phases of the eclipse are from −0.0915 to 0.0915, the
phases of the total eclipse are from −0.017 to 0.017, which means that the values of
D and d are:

D = 0.183
d = 0.034

Thus, the lower limits of the relative radiuses:

R1
a
R2
a

= 0.219

= 0.325

The ratio R2/R1 = 1.48 determined from geometrical constrains is an excellent
agreement with that obtained using the ﬂuxes. Thus we conclude that the inclination
angle is close to 90◦.

The most interesting feature of the phase curves is the statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between values of maxima in both ﬁlters. This diﬀerence reaches 0.m060 ±
0.m003 in ﬁlter R and 0.m039 ± 0.m005 in ﬁlter V . The cause of such eﬀect might be
a cold or a hot spot in the photosphere of one of the stars.

To ﬁnd out if the spot is steady, we checked the ASAS database. There are
493 ﬁt points in ﬁlter V, which were obtained during the period from JD2451876 to
JD2455049. Using these observations we determined the period and the initial epoch.
The values are P = 1.d788797 ± 0.d0000021 and T0 = HJD2453494.2755 ± 0.0014
respectively. The phase curve is shown on the Fig. 4. There is no statistically sig-
niﬁcant asymmetry on this curve, perhaps, because of rather big error of individual
observations. Thus, using ASAS data, we can’t conclude on the stability of the spot.
On the other hand, according to the previous calculations, the spectral classes
of the components of WZ Crv are G2 – G6 and A6 – F1, which nearly completely
excludes the possibility of forming rather steady big cold spots in the photosphere
of at least one of the stars. More possible solution is the presenting of a hot spot as
the result of deep impact of the accretion stream from the ﬁrst component (donor)
directly into the photosphere of the second one (accretor) without forming the accre-
tion disk. In this case the hot spot will be rather steady, which might be conﬁrmed
by further observations.

V Period Variations and Mass Transfer

To study stability of the orbital period using the O-C analysis [15], we compiled a list
of the minima timings. The individual times of minima were published by Otero &
Dubovsky (2004) and Locher (2005). added the median time of minima, calculated
from our observations, from the NSVS database and from the ASAS database. ASAS
data covers rather long period of observations (9 years), so we divided this array

6

into three parts (JD 2451876-2452879, JD 2452977-2453908, JD 2454091-2455049)
and analyzed them individually. For the ASAS data, we have used several methods.
The period and the initial epoch of the best "complete" trigonometric polynomial
ﬁt of order 9 were used for further analysis. As for these data there is no evidence
for a statistical diﬀerence of maxima, we have used a “symmetric” trigonometric
polynomial ﬁt

x(φ) = C1 +

S

X
j=1

Cj+1 cos(2πj(φ − φ0)),

where φ is the phase corresponding to the moment of time t: φ = (t − T0)/P −
INT ((t − T0)/P ), where T0 is an “initial epoch”, P is a period and INT (x) is an
integer part of x.

The coeﬃcients Cj were determined using a linear method of least squares
and the parameter φ0 (phase of the main minimum) was determined by itera-
tions (non-linear method of least squares). Using the value of φ0, we have com-
puted a “mean” moments of time of minimum, which are closest to the mean time
of the observations similar to a “complete” trigonometric polynomial ﬁt x(φ) =
j=1 Cj+1 cos(2πj(φ − φ0j)) with phases φ0j, which are individual for each har-
C1 + P
monic. Symmetric trigonometric polynomial of 9-th order were used for the NSVS
data and the 3 intervals of the ASAS. They are listed in the Table 2.

For all ASAS data, we obtained HJDmin = 2453494.27648 ± 0.00115. However,
this value corresponds to a wide interval and thus shifted from the smoothing curve.
The minimum of Locher deviates signiﬁcantly from the ﬁt as well. This is due to
a large error estimate, which is by a factor of 3-27 times larger than the minima
timings determined from our observations and that of the NSVS and ASAS. Thus
we excluded the values from the ASAS (three subintervals together) and of Locher
[5] from our analysis. As there is no error estimate of the timing was published by
Otero & Dubovsky [4], we have used the same weight for all minima timings.

Thus, we analyzed 7 times of minima, and made the O-C diagram as the depen-
dence between the cycle number and the residual O − C = TE − (T0 + P E), i.e. the
diﬀerence between the observed and calculated times of minima. The O-C diagram
exhibits a parabolic shape, which is characteristic for secular period variations (cf.
Tsessevich [16]). The smoothing parabola is shown on the Fig. 5. The least-squared
method yields the equation for time of minima:

Tmin = 2451596.3722

±0.002

+ 1.788795
±0.000002

·(E − 918) + 1.09 · 10−8
±0.31·10−8

·(E − 918)2

9

From the diagram and the equation it is clear that the orbital period and, accord-
ing to Kepler’s law, the distance between the components increases. In assumption
of conservative system, we determined dP/dt:

dP/dt = (1.2 ± 0.3) · 10−8days/yr,

and the characteristic time of the period variations is

P/(dP/dt) = (4.02 ± 1.13) · 105yr.

It means that the matter streams rather fast from the less massive star to the
more massive one. In the case of WZ Crv it means that the second component lost
its mass and the matter streams throw the inner Lagrange point falls into the Roche
lobe of the second component, which completely consistent with the direct impact
accretion stream version of a hot spot.
