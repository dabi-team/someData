Abstract. Mid-air interaction is one of  the promising interaction  modalities  in  virtual reality (VR) due to its  merits in 
naturalness and intuitiveness, but the interaction suffers from the lack of haptic feedback as no force or vibrotactile feedback 
can  be  provided  in  mid-air.  As  a  breakthrough  to  compensate  for  this  insufficiency,  the  application  of  pseudo-haptic 
features  which create the visuo-haptic illusion  without actual physical  haptic stimulus can be  explored. Therefore, this 
study  aimed  to  investigate  the  effect  of  four  pseudo-haptic  features:  proximity  feedback,  protrusion,  hit  effect,  and 
penetration blocking on user experience for free-hand mid-air button interaction in VR. We conducted a user study on 21 
young subjects to collect user ratings on various aspects of user experience while users were freely interacting with 16 
buttons with different combinations of four features. Results indicated that all investigated features significantly improved 
user  experience  in  terms  of  haptic  illusion,  embodiment,  sense  of  reality,  spatiotemporal  perception,  satisfaction,  and 
hedonic quality. In addition, protrusion and hit effect were more beneficial in comparison with the other two features. It is 
recommended  to  utilize  the  four  proposed  pseudo-haptic  features  in  3D  user  interfaces  (UIs)  to  make  users  feel  more 
pleased and amused, but caution is needed when using proximity feedback together with other features. The findings of 
this study could be helpful for VR developers and UI designers in providing better interactive buttons in the 3D interfaces.

1.  Introduction 

Virtual Reality (VR) is a concept that has existed for several decades but has not gained much attention from 
the general public until the recent advancement of mass-market VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), which 
have renewed the interest in the design of 3D user interfaces (UIs) and 3D interaction techniques in immersive 
virtual environments. In such environments, head and hand tracking are often enabled by 6 degree-of-freedom 
tracking  technologies  that  potentially  provide  natural  and  direct  interaction  with  objects  stereoscopically 
displayed in the virtual world. Consequently, the user can manipulate virtual objects within reach in a similar 
way to grabbing or selecting objects in the real world. 

Selection is one of the fundamental tasks of user interaction in VR and 3D UIs (LaViola Jr. et al., 2017), 
and  button is  one  of the  fundamental  widgets  in  UI  both  physically  and  digitally  (Janlert,  2014),  inevitably 
evolving to the 3D form in VR (Speicher et al., 2019; van Dam, 1997). However, current 3D UIs are usually 
designed by adapting directly from the paradigm of 2D UIs (Lee et al., 2018) which leads to a gap in the user 
experience (Bowman et al., 2012). Interacting with the 2D UI in 3D space is known to be demanding due to the 
inherent difficulty of understanding and performing actions in 3D space (Herndon et al., 1994).  

In  the  HMD-based  VR,  head-gaze,  hand-held  controllers,  and  free-hand  mid-air  gestural  inputs  are 
considered  typical  interaction  modalities  (Speicher  et  al.,  2018).  Although  the  controller-based  interaction 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
turned out to be more responsive than the free-hand mid-air interaction (Caggianese et al., 2019; Dudley et al., 
2019), mid-air interaction is regarded as a natural and intuitive way of interacting with 3D UIs in VR (Lee and 
Hui, 2018). Since the release of the Leap Motion controller which supports real-time skeletal tracking of the 
user’s hands and fingers, steady efforts on technological advancements have been driven in the field of vision-
based hand tracking. The current market-dominating VR and augmented reality (AR) HMDs such as Oculus 
Quest 2 and Microsoft Hololens 2 are coming out with a decent real-time hand tracking capability enabled by 
inputs from embedded monochrome (Han et al., 2020) or depth (Ungureanu et al., 2020) cameras, facilitating a 
simple and easy implementation of controller-free mid-air interactions in VR. 

Although  mid-air  interaction  in  VR  demonstrates  the  remarkable  advantages  of  naturalness  and 
intuitiveness, the usability of VR UIs is highly dependent on the availability of haptic feedback. Many studies 
have proven that the interaction suffers when no haptic feedback is provided (Benko et al., 2006; Dudley et al., 
2019; Faeth and Harding, 2014; Hoggan et al., 2008; Shneiderman, 1997; Zhao et al., 2014). In order to provide 
the haptic feedback to inform users about the confirmation of their action, studies have used active haptics with 
wearable haptic devices such as smart gloves/thimbles (Blake and Gurocak, 2009; Bouzit et al., 2002; Bullion 
and  Gurocak,  2009;  Gabardi  et  al.,  2016;  Kim  et  al.,  2016)  and  contactless  modalities  such  as  ultrasounds 
(Arafsha et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2019; Shakeri et al., 2018), while passive haptics has 
been enabled by physical props (Azmandian et al., 2016; Joyce and Robinson, 2017; Strandholt et al., 2020). 
However, such approaches for providing the haptic feedback would eventually require compatible equipment, 
resulting  in  ineffective  and  bulky  experience  in  real-life  VR  usages  (Hwang  et  al.,  2017),  and  not  always 
available to users taking the practical considerations into account. Therefore, the lack of haptic feedback remains 
as the common problem of current mid-air button interaction. 

The  pseudo-haptic  method  which  uses  multi-sensory  contradiction,  where  visual  cues  create  haptic 
illusions without actual physical haptic stimulus (Hachisu et al., 2011) can be a breakthrough for compensating 
this issue (Chattopadhyay, 2016). Although it has been more than two decades since the first proposal of the 
concept of pseudo-haptics (Lecuyer et al., 2000), the adaptation of pseudo-haptic features into the design factors 
of buttons for modern VR is surprisingly lacking. A survey revealed that the design factors of buttons in VR 
such as sizes, positions, types, and shapes are not sufficiently addressed (Dube and Arif, 2019). Moreover, there 
have been very few comparative studies covering the fundamental factors of button design in VR (Bermejo et 
al., 2021). One recent preliminary study compared the planar (2D) and pseudo-haptic (3D) representations of 
UI widgets for menu interaction, and concluded the pseudo-haptic UI performs better in terms of workload, user 
experience, motion sickness, and immersion (Speicher et al., 2019). This demonstrates the potential of pseudo-
haptic features for improving user experience thereby making other features worth studying in the domain of 
mid-air interaction in VR. 

This study aims to investigate the effect of four pseudo-haptic features on the experience of the user 
touching  the  virtual  button  in  mid-air.  We  conducted  a  user  study  to  collect  ratings  on  various  subjective 
evaluation and user experience aspects when interacting with 16 buttons consist of different combinations of 
existence and nonexistence of four pseudo-haptic features. Then, we asked their preference towards each of the 
four pseudo-haptic features and the reasons behind their decisions.

2.1. Free-Hand Mid-Air Interaction 

Mid-air interaction is a type of kinesthetic interaction (Fogtmann et al., 2008), denoting touchless and gesture-
based  interactions  with  displays  or  devices  (Koutsabasis  and  Vogiatzidakis,  2019).  Free-hand  mid-air 
interaction possesses great potential in enabling natural UI in many user scenarios such as VR/AR applications, 
human-robot  interactions,  smart  homes,  and  autonomous  devices.  In  comparison  with  controller-based 
interfaces, users are free from holding a device and are allowed to engage with virtual objects directly via hand 

2 

 
 
motions, promoting intuitiveness of the UI as spatial gestures are closely linked to the inherent manipulation 
skill of the human (Hinckley et al., 1994). Free-hand interfaces require tracking systems to detect mid-air hand 
gestures of the user as input. In virtue of extensive research on vision-based hand pose estimation (Ahmad et 
al., 2019; Erol et al., 2007; Supančič et al., 2018), modern commercial VR/AR HMDs are capable of detecting 
hands in real-time with embedded cameras. 

Earlier works on free-hand mid-air interaction were explored across various modalities and application 
fields. Luo and Kenyon used scalable computing technologies to engage vision-based gesture interaction in a 
high-resolution tiled display setting (Luo and Kenyon, 2009). Hilliges et al. provided an easy way to handle 
digital contents in 3D by exploiting space above a standard interactive tabletop (Hilliges et al., 2009). Benko 
and Wilson combined free-hand pinch gestures with speech for the interaction of multiple users with a large 
curved display (Benko and Wilson, 2010). Nancel et al. developed a set of mid-air pan-and-zoom gestures to 
interact  with  graphics  on  a  wall-sized  display  (Nancel  et  al.,  2011).  Song  et  al.  studied  designs  of  mid-air 
interaction in a free-hand setting for object manipulation in a 3D virtual space (Song et al., 2012).  

Regarding direct interaction with floating virtual objects, several pioneering studies have explored using 
a Fresnel lens (Chan et al., 2010), a concave mirror (Butler et al., 2011), a see-through display (Hilliges et al., 
2012), and a stereo projector (Benko et al., 2012), whereas later implementations occurred more in the context 
of VR HMD. Speicher et al. and Bermejo et al. tested design features of 3D UI for mid-air interaction in VR 
(Bermejo et al., 2021; Speicher et al., 2019), while Speicher et al. and Fashimpaur et al. emphasized improving 
user performance and experience for VR text entry (Fashimpaur et al., 2020; Speicher et al., 2018). 

2.2. Pseudo-Haptics for Mid-Air Interaction 

Most  of  the  previous  works  on  pseudo-haptics  have  simulated  haptic  properties  by  offering  supplementary 
visual cues when the physical haptic cues were present by active devices or passive props (Abtahi et al., 2019; 
Abtahi and Follmer, 2018; Argelaguet et al., 2013; Ban et al., 2014; Dzidek et al., 2018; Hirano et al., 2011; 
Kimura and Nojima, 2012; Monnai et al., 2014; Punpongsanon et al., 2015, 2014; Samad et al., 2019; Sato et 
al., 2020; Ujitoko et al., 2015), thereby whether pseudo-haptic feedback could be made without a user's physical 
engagement with a tangible object remained uncertain. Interestingly, only a few studies attempted to create a 
haptic illusion in mid-air interaction when no external haptic inputs were given. Speicher et al. compared the 
experience of users for mid-air finger-based menu interaction with 2D and 3D UIs, and found 3D UI performed 
better  (Speicher  et  al.,  2019).  Kawabe  tested  the  stiffness  of  the  virtual  object  with  varied  ratios  of  object 
deformation magnitude to the hand distance and found the deformation-to-distance ratio affected the perceived 
stiffness (Kawabe, 2020). Kang et al. revealed visual and auditory cues can influence perceived roughness on 
virtual mobile gadgets in mixed reality (Kang et al., 2021). These studies have shown the feasibility of pseudo-
haptic feedback in mid-air interaction. 

Haptic  feedback  supports  interaction  by  providing  users  an  important  confirmation  of  a  successful 
action. Therefore, visually augmented pseudo-haptic features can enhance haptic illusion or provide additional 
information to strengthen confirmation of the action to attain the same benefits. There is a large body of research 
investigating such features. One attempt was to use shadows as depth cues to enhance illusions when selecting 
or  manipulating  virtual  objects.  Herndon  et  al.  visualized  the  spatial  relationships  between  objects  in  3D 
applications with shadows (Herndon et al., 1992), whereas Wanger investigated the effect of shadow sharpness 
and shape on the spatial relationships (Wanger, 1992). Chan et al. proposed the pseudo-shadow visual feedback 
which indicated the proximity of the finger on interacting with intangible displays, and found that feedback was 
helpful in improving user performance and satisfaction (Chan et al., 2010).

Another attempt was made in the design of UI widgets to adapt affordances of real-world objects. Planar 
2D UIs were transformed into protruded pseudo-haptic 3D UIs following the look of real-world widgets (e.g. 
buttons, switches, sliders, and control knobs) in addition to the stereoscopic cues to further enhance the illusion 
like the user is interacting with tangible objects. The comparisons were made for the stereoscopic display (Zilch 
et  al.,  2014)  and  the  VR  HMD  (Speicher  et  al.,  2019),  and  reported  superior  performance  of  protruded  3D 
widgets  in  terms  of  usability  and  user  experience  ratings.  Meanwhile,  a  recent  study  compared  2D  and  3D 
buttons for the numeric keypad typing task, and their results implied the 3D buttons induced lesser button press 
depth when haptic cues are provided, while 2D buttons induced higher entry speed than the 3D counterparts 
(Bermejo et al., 2021). 

One  feature  could  be  inspired  from  the  field  of  gaming,  where  the  game  designers  attempted  to 
maximize  the  feeling  of  hit  when  the  player  attacks  the  enemy  to  improve  enjoyment.  This  attempt  bears 
resemblance to the pseudo-haptic approach in the sense that it creates a sensual illusion of collision with extra 
visual effects. Studies have examined the impact of various visual (e.g. particle, afterimage, vibration, and view 
adjustment) and auditory (e.g. shooting sound, explosion sound, and groan) effects in the 2D shooting game 
(Kim  and Kim,  2004;  Seo and Kim,  2010)  and  the  2D  fighting  game  (Moon  and  Cho,  2012),  and revealed 
significant improvements on the feeling of hit with such effects. 

The other approach could be derived from the attempt to block the virtual hand from penetrating the 
virtual object, which eventually leads to the displacement between the real and virtual hands. This approach 
was first proposed by Lindeman et al. (2001), and was identified as evidence to prove visual dominance over 
proprioception (Burns et al., 2006) and haptic modality (Mensvoort et al., 2008). While extensive research has 
focused  on  utilizing  hand  displacement  for  the  selection  of  the  out-of-reach  objects  (Benda  et  al.,  2020; 
Gonzalez  and  Follmer,  2019;  Ogawa  et  al.,  2020; Tian  et  al.,  2020), limited  efforts  were  made  for  pseudo-
haptics. Pusch et al. applied hand displacement to provide haptic-like sensations by dynamically displacing the 
virtual hand in the simulation of force fields, and found most participants could feel force illusion that their 
hand was pushed inside the force field (Pusch et al., 2009). Rietzler et al. tested the pseudo-haptic feedback of 
the virtual hand not penetrating the static object, and reported a significant increase in immersion and enjoyment 
(Rietzler et al., 2018a). In this study, we adopt this feature to block the penetration of the finger in the context 
of button interaction in VR. 

It is worthwhile to examine the pseudo-haptic features on their effect on the user experience for mid-
air interaction in VR as the definitive conclusion cannot be made based on the prior works. In this study, we 
consider four aforementioned pseudo-haptic button design features: proximity feedback, protrusion, hit effect, 
and penetration blocking. 

3.  Methods 

3.1. Participants 

Twenty-one Korean young adults (13 males and 8 females) between the ages of 19 and 33 (M=23.8, SD=4.0) 
and with normal or corrected to normal vision participated in the experiment. All participants except one were 
right-handed.  Eighteen  participants  have  experienced  a  kind  of  headset-based  VR  applications  before  this 
experiment, but 16 of them used the VR headset no more than once a year, showing the majority of participants 
were light VR users. Six participants reported that they experienced mid-air interaction with the tracked virtual 
hand in VR. All participants gave consent for the experiment protocol approved by the University Institutional 
Review Board (IRB NO.: KH2021-009).

3.2. Experimental Design 

Four pseudo-haptic features were investigated in this study (Figure 1). The first feature, proximity feedback (PF) 
provided visual feedback when the finger goes near the button by showing a circle that enlarges as the finger 
approaches the button. The use of pseudo-shadow was avoided to be independent of the direction of light of the 
virtual environment. The second feature, protrusion (PT) enabled the contact surface to be protruded then pushed 
into the base, mimicking the affordance of the real-world 3D button. The design of the button was adopted from 
the one proposed in a previous study (Speicher et al., 2019) and the example described in the guideline for 
Oculus  developers  (Facebook,  2021).  The third  feature,  hit  effect  (HE)  added  an  extra  sparkling  visual  cue 
together with a small vibration of the button when triggered. Although shaking the screen induced the largest 
feeling of hit in a fighting game (Moon and Cho, 2012), it was not appropriate to be applied in VR since visually 
induced experiences of self-motion are known to cause motion sickness (Bonato et al., 2008). Therefore, two 
applicable  effects:  visual  vibration  and  collision  graphics  were  selected  for  this  study.  The  last  feature, 
penetration blocking (PB) prohibited penetration of the virtual hand which is shown to the user, although the 
real hand actually penetrated the button. Total 16 buttons with different combinations were created by enabling 
(O) or disabling (X) each of four features, and a 2 proximity feedback (

3.3. Experimental settings 

The participants experienced the virtual test environment with an Oculus Quest (resolution: 1440×1600 per eye; 
refresh  rate:  72  Hz)  VR  headset,  while  the  headset  was  connected  to  the  PC  through  Oculus  Link  via  a 
compatible USB 3.0 cable. The PC used to run the test environment was equipped with an Intel Core i7-7700 
processor running at 3.6 GHz, 16 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, running Windows 
10. Hands were tracked in real-time by the four fisheye monochrome cameras embedded in the Oculus Quest 
headset with the help of  an advanced hand detection network (Han et al., 2020). As hands were tracked by 
monochrome images, the background was covered by a black screen fence to prevent any potential deterioration 
of tracking performance (Figure 2-a). It is worth noting that although the virtual hand representation used in this 
study  is  not  the  most  human-like  hands,  it  does  not  severely  violate  the  human-likeness  thus  does  not 
significantly affect tactile experiences (Schwind et al., 2018). The screen fence was located 1.2 m away from 
participants,  providing  them  enough  space  to  freely  interact  with  the  virtual  targets  without  any  physical 
interruptions. 

Inside the virtual test environment developed using Unity 2019.4.15f1, 16 circular buttons were placed 
in front of the participant in a 4×4 square grid (Figure 2-b). The center of the grid was located 0.2 m (scale unit 
in Unity) below the height of the VR headset when the participant was standing. The distance between two 
neighboring buttons placed in the same row or column was 0.1 m, and the diameter of the buttons was 5 cm. 
The participants were allowed to freely step back and forth to adjust the distance to the buttons to find the best 
setting for them to comfortably interact with the buttons. It is worthy to note that the location of buttons was 
determined to facilitate minimum ergonomic cost (Evangelista Belo et al., 2021) while taking the hand tracking 
range of the Oculus Quest headset into account to guarantee stable tracking performance at all times.

the virtual environment was invisible to the participants in the actual experiment. 

3.4. Experimental Procedure 

First,  participants  filled  in  a  pre-test  questionnaire  asking  about  their  demographic  information  and  prior 
experience with VR. After participants were explained about four pseudo-haptic features and the difference 
between 16 buttons, they were asked to press each of 16 buttons (Figure 2-b) with the index finger of their 

6 

 
 
 
dominant hand twice following the pre-defined randomized order. Then, 11 subjective evaluation items about 
haptic  illusion,  embodiment,  sense  of  reality,  presence,  spatiotemporal  perception,  and  satisfaction  aspects 
(Gonzalez-Franco and Peck, 2018; Pusch et al., 2009; Schwind et al., 2018; Usoh et al., 2000) were asked and 
the responses were collected through 7-point Likert scales (Table 1). In addition, a short version of the User 
Experience Questionnaire (Schrepp et al., 2017) was used to collect pragmatic and hedonic quality aspects of 
user  experience (Table 1). After  participants  were  asked  to  answer  their  preference  on  each feature and the 
corresponding  reasons,  they  were  encouraged  to  select  a  single  most  preferred  button,  although  multiple 
selections  were  allowed  in  case  they  did  not  have  a  clear  preference  on  certain  features.  During  the  whole 
questionnaire session, questionnaire items were presented right next to the buttons all the time, and participants 
verbally gave the rating in their preferred order while freely interacting with buttons as many times as they 
wanted. 

Table 1. Items of the subjective evaluation and user experience questionnaires used in this study. Answers were 
given  through  7-point  Likert  scales  (Subjective  evaluation:  1=strongly  disagree,  7=strongly  agree;  User

3.5. Data Analysis 

Ratings for items of the subjective evaluation and user experience questionnaires were collected and arranged 
for statistical analysis. For all aspects, mean ratings within each category were used for the analysis. No outliers 
in ratings were detected according to the Grubbs’ outlier test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted 
to  check  the  statistical  significance  of  each  subjective  evaluation  item.  Minitab  19  was  used  to  conduct  all 
statistical analyses at a significance level of 0.05. The variation from participants was blocked. The effect size 
in  terms  of  eta-squared  (
 was  further  calculated  to  check  practical  significance.  A  general  rule  on  the

5.  Discussion 

5.1. Main Findings 

PF majorly contributed to spatiotemporal perception as it should be, adhering to its original intention of aiding 
the perception of distance between the finger and the button by providing additional visual cues. Visual feedback 
about motion pattern and position coordinates significantly influences early and later stages of hand movement 
(Saunders and Knill, 2004), and enhances parallel processing of the visual and kinesthetic information about 
the  ongoing  hand  movement  (Sigrist  et  al.,  2013).  This  could  be  especially  useful  in  the  immersive  virtual 
environment  where  distances  tend  to  be  underestimated  (Interrante  et  al.,  2006;  Knapp  and  Loomis,  2004). 
However, the negative effect of PF on the pragmatic quality indicating less value in traditional usability aspects  
(Schrepp  et  al.,  2006)  should  be  noted.  Detailed  analysis  on  individual  questionnaire  items  revealed  that 
participants felt the button with PF slightly more supportive (
=0.012) but moderately 
=0.087), which eventually led to lower ratings on the pragmatic 
more complicated (
quality. Chan et al. warned that continuous feedback could easily distract users as it provides extra visual cues 
during the entire interaction process but fails to inform the exact time the button is touched (Chan et al., 2010). 
The same result was observed in this study that 29% of participants disliked PF because it was distracting and 
continually gave undesirable pressure like they should press the button. Nevertheless, PF was favored by twice 
the number of participants (57%) and contributed to a slight improvement on other subjective aspects and a 
considerable improvement in the hedonic quality.

The positive effect of PT on user experience was expected as shown in several prior studies. Studies 
have shown 3D buttons were better than 2D buttons in terms of overall usability and memorability (Zilch et al., 
2014); overall user experience, workload, motion sickness, and immersion (Speicher et al., 2019); naturalness, 
perceived performance, and preference (Dube and Arif, 2020). On top of that, this study newly revealed the 
improvements  from  the  3D  button  in  haptic  illusion,  embodiment,  sense  of  reality,  and  spatiotemporal 
perception. Participants found the interaction more interesting and feel more like pressing the real-world button 
when  PT  is  enabled,  which  is  in  line  with  the  study  of  Speicher  et  al.  (2019)  where  participants  found  the 
affordance-oriented design of the 3D button more exciting and motivating. Participants in our study claimed PT 
also helped knowing when the button will be pressed, as the distance between the protruded surface and the 
base offered an extra visual cue. The cue acts similar to PF in a sense, but unlike PF, it relies on the stereoscopic 
depth cue of the button surface protruded towards the user.  In addition, some participants thought it was a good 
match with other features; for example, three participants conditionally preferred to have other features only 
when the button is protruded (one participant for each of PF, HE, and PB). 

By combining two effects: visual vibration and collision graphics, HE successfully emulated the feeling 
of  hit  and  corresponding  pseudo-haptic  sensation.  Visual  vibration  has  been  applied  to  the  cursor  to  evoke 
pseudo-haptic surface roughness of the touch screen (Costes et al., 2019), and stylized visual effects have been 
explored in simulating haptic properties of touching real and virtual objects in AR (Mercado et al., 2020), but 
to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study investigated pseudo-haptics of these two visual effects in mid-
air button interaction in VR. HE had a moderate to large impact on all subjective evaluation and user experience 
aspects except the pragmatic quality but especially, it induced the largest impact on satisfaction (MD=1.42) and 
hedonic quality (MD=1.91) among four investigated features. This result is reasonable considering this feature 
was inspired by special effects used in gaming, which put a huge emphasis on the entertainment and enjoyment 
of players. Interestingly, no participants disliked this feature. Participants claimed the hit effect not only made 
the interaction feel more interesting and tangible but also helped to know exactly when the button is pressed. 
Discrete feedback such as an instant visual transition or a sound effect is known to benefit interaction by clearly 
confirming a touch, yet provides little help before a touch (Chan et al., 2010). Therefore, the combination of PT 
and HE can be considered as a great harmony by offering advantages of both discrete and continuous feedback. 

13 

 
Notably,  PT  and  HE  were unconditionally  preferred  by  90%  of participants, and  buttons  with  both features 
enabled were chosen as the favorite by 79% of all choices (Figure 6-b). 

The effect of PB was statistically significant but had a small practical impact on all subjective evaluation 
and user experience aspects except presence. 52% of participants who preferred PB claimed it enhanced haptic 
illusion and helped know when the button is pressed by checking the hand movement is blocked. They felt 
awkward, not realistic, and out of control when the hand penetrates the button because this is not what people 
with common sense will expect to happen in the real world. This becomes clear if we see the result that the 
sense of reality was influenced the most among all aspects, with the mean difference of 0.65 and eta-squared of 
0.047. On the other hand, 19% of participants who did not like PB mentioned they felt their hand movement is 
restricted and awkward since it does not match with the movement of their real hand. This implies a caution is 
needed when applying this feature, as large offsets between the virtual and real hands over the threshold can 
place a big perceptional discrepancy between vision and proprioception (Burns et al., 2006). Although detection 
thresholds of hand redirection have been derived previously (horizontal/vertical offset: 4.5°, gain-based offset: 
0.88-1.07; Zenner & Kruger, 2019), a further investigation to identify the offset threshold that can severely 
damage user experience in this specific case is needed, as even obvious perceivable offsets were accepted and 
preferred by VR users in some cases (Rietzler et al., 2018a, 2018b). 24% of participants who did not have a 
preference on this feature explained they could not identify an obvious difference caused by enabling PB. As 
participants were not requested to press the button beyond the base when they interact with the button, buttons 
with and without PB could be perceived as indistinguishable for some participants who always stopped their 
finger at the base before penetration. 

It is worth mentioning the popular reasons for preference in all features were: (1) I felt an illusion of a 
reactive force or a touch (haptic illusion), (2) I felt like pressing the real-world button (sense of reality), (3) I 
easily knew the finger distance and the moment the button is pressed (spatiotemporal perception), and (4) I felt 
more interesting (hedonic quality). Haptic illusion (ρ=0.75), sense of reality (ρ=0.69), spatiotemporal perception 
(ρ=0.60), and hedonic quality (ρ=0.62) showed moderate to strong correlation with satisfaction. Our results 
provide a piece of empirical evidence that pseudo-haptic button design features could elevate such perception-
related items thereby improve the user experience of free-hand mid-air interaction in VR. 

According  to  the  results,  all  four  proposed  pseudo-haptic  button  design  features  either  majorly  or 
minorly contributed to improving user experience. However, it is doubtful whether more features will always 
lead to a better user experience. Although the button with all features enabled was chosen by the largest number 
of participants as their favorite, some results proved otherwise. Some participants pointed out a certain feature 
(especially  PF)  feels  distracting  when  too  many  features  are  used  together,  thereby  either  disliked  or 
conditionally  liked  corresponding  features.  For  instance,  two  participants  preferred  PF  and  HE  under  the 
condition  of  enabling  only  one  of  the  two.  Their  concerns  were  also  reflected  in  the  ratings  as  significant 
interaction effects which indicated the decrease of feature impact at combined usage among PF, PT, and HE. 

5.2. Design Implications 

Our  research findings  implied that  all  four investigated  pseudo-haptic  features  (PF,  PT,  HE, and  PB) could 
benefit users in terms of user experience. VR developers can consider adapting proposed features into the design 
of  3D  UI  to  improve  perceived  haptic  illusion,  embodiment,  sense  of  reality,  spatiotemporal  perception, 
satisfaction,  and  hedonic  quality  of  users.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  effect  of  PF  and  PB  were 
relatively minor along with a nonnegligible portion of disfavor compared to PT and HE. Therefore, an option 
to disable specific features could be beneficial for certain users, as individuals comprehend and interpret the 
haptic experience in different ways hence might want to tailor effects for their preferences (Schneider et al., 

14 

 
 
2017).  The  proposed  features  can  be  applied  to  general  3D  UIs  with  interactive  buttons  in  any  type  of  VR 
application to provide a more satisfactory and enjoyable experience to users. Except for PB which relies on a 
virtual representation of the real hand, we expect the remaining three features: PF, PT, and HE can be applied 
to 3D UIs in other application domains (e.g. AR) to merit users. 

5.3. Limitations and Future Work 

This  study  has  some  limitations.  First  of  all,  since  this  study  mainly  focused  on  investigating  the  effect  of 
pseudo-haptic features on user experience, the effect on task performance was not considered. A recent study 
from Bermejo et al. reported that the users with 2D buttons unintuitively achieved faster key entry speed than 
the 3D buttons in the numeric keypad typing task (Bermejo et al., 2021), showing the possibility that button 
protrusion  may  result  in  worse  performance  in  certain  task  scenarios,  although  Dube  and  Arif  reported 
contradictory results that 3D keys yielded lower error rate compared to 2D keys in the VR text entry task (Dube 
and Arif, 2020). Future work can further verify the effect of proposed features on the task performance for 
interacting with 3D UI or virtual keyboard where mid-air touch interaction with virtual buttons can frequently 
occur. Second, this study attempted to investigate the pure effect of visual cues hence excluded the auditory 
cues which were proven to be effective in addition to visual cues for multi-modal conditions (Bermejo et al., 
2021; Chan et al., 2010; Kobayashi et al., 2016; Lecuyer et al., 2001). The addition of auditory cues with proper 
sensory  integration  strategy  to  further  improve  the  user  experience  of  mid-air  interaction  in  VR  can  be 
investigated in future work. Third, the hit effect consisted of two visual components: a visual vibration effect 
and a collision graphics effect, so it is unclear whether the positive impact mainly came from the particle effect 
or the vibration effect. These two effects could not be investigated separately to keep the number of factors and 
experimental  conditions  manageable  in  this  study,  but  a  more  concrete  investigation  on  individual  effects 
deserves consideration in the future. 

6.  Conclusion 

We conducted a user study with 21 young subjects to investigate the effect of four pseudo-haptic button design 
features (proximity feedback, protrusion, hit effect, and penetration blocking) on user experience for free-hand 
mid-air button interaction in VR. All investigated features significantly and positively affected user experience 
in terms of haptic illusion, embodiment, sense of reality, spatiotemporal perception, satisfaction, and hedonic 
quality. In addition, protrusion and hit effect were more beneficial in comparison with the other two features. It 
is  suggested  to  use  the  four  proposed  pseudo-haptic  features  for  designing  3D  UI  to  make  users  feel  more 
satisfied and entertained, but caution is needed when using proximity feedback together with other features. The 
findings of this study may serve as a useful input for VR developers and UI designers to create better interactive 
buttons in 3D UI.
