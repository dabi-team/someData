Abstract Some evidences of wind variability and velocity stratiﬁcation in the extended
atmosphere has been found in the spectra of the supergiant V340 Ser (=IRAS 17279−1119)
taken at the 6-m BTA telescope with a spectral resolution R≥60000. The Hα line has a
P Cyg proﬁle whose absorption component (V=+34 km/s) is formed in the upper layers
of the expanding atmosphere close to the circumstellar environment. For four dates the
mean velocity has been derived from the positions of 300–550 symmetric metal absorptions
with an accuracy better than ±0.1 km/s: V⊙ = 59.30, 60.09, 58.46, and 55.78 km/s. A
lot of low-excitation metal lines have an inverse P Cyg proﬁle. The mean positions of
their emission components, V⊙= 46.3±0.4 km/s, diﬀer systematically from the velocity
inferred from symmetric absorptions, suggesting the presence of a velocity gradient in the
supergiant extended atmosphere. The multicomponent proﬁle of the NaI D lines contains
the interstellar, V⊙ = −11.2 km/s, and circumstellar, V⊙=+10 km/s, components and the
component forming in the upper atmospheric layers, V⊙=+34.0 km/s. The mean velocity
from 20–30 diﬀuse interstellar bands (DIBs) identiﬁed in the spectra, V⊙(DIBs) =−11.6±
0.2 km/s, agrees with the velocity from interstellar NaI and KI components. The equivalent
width of the oxygen triplet W(OI 7774) = 1.25 ˚A corresponds to an absolute magnitude of
the star Mv≈ −4.6m, which, taking into account the total (interstellar + circumstellar)
extinction, leads to a distance to the star d≈2.3 kpc.

1. INTRODUCTION

V340 Ser, the central star of the infrared (IR) source IRAS 17279−1119, was entered into a list
of stars with IR excesses by Oudmaijer et al. (1992). Later, having studied the Hubble Space
Telescope data for a large sample of IR sources, Si`odmiak et al. (2008) showed IRAS 17279−1119
to have a point image and classiﬁed V340 Ser as a postasymptotic giant branch (hereafter post-
AGB) star. These authors pointed out the presence of a near-IR excess, suggesting the presence

of warm circumstellar dust. Highly evolved stars with initial masses in the range 2 ÷ 8M⊙ are
observed at the post-AGB stage.

According to Bl¨ocker (1995a), at the preceding AGB evolutionary stage these stars are ob-
served as red supergiants with eﬀective temperatures Teﬀ≈ 3000 ÷ 4500 K. The AGB stage for
stars with the above masses is the ﬁnal evolution phase with nucleosynthesis in the stellar cores.
The interest in AGB stars and their closest descendants stems primarily from the fact that in
the interiors of these stars, which are at a short evolutionary stage, there are physical condi-
tions for the synthesis of heavy-metal nuclei and the dredge-up of nuclear reaction products
into the stellar atmosphere and then into the circumstellar and interstellar medium. Due to
these processes, AGB stars with initial masses below 3 ÷ 4M⊙ are the main suppliers of all the
elements heavier than iron synthesized through the s-process, which basically consists in slow
(compared to β decay) neutronization of nuclei. Fe nuclei serve as initial nuclei for the chain
of s-process reactions. In stars with initial mass below 3 ÷ 4M⊙ the required neutron ﬂux is
provided by the 13C(α, n)16O reaction, while in the case of more massive stars, with initial mass
above 4 ÷ 5M⊙, the analogous reaction proceeds on 22Ne nuclei. It should be emphasized that
these more massive AGB stars can also be the sources of lithium. The details of the evolution of
stars near the AGB and the results of present-day calculations of the synthesis and dredge-up
of elements are presented in Herwig (2005), di Criscienzo et al. (2016), and Liu et al. (2018).

The spectral type F2–3 II is given for the supergiant V340 Ser in the SIMBAD database. This
supergiant lies outside the Galactic plane, which already suggests that it probably belongs to
low mass evolved stars. By now the star has been studied by both photometric and spectroscopic
methods. A number of authors (in particular, Kazarovets et al. 2000; de Smedt et al. 2016)
classify V340 Ser as an RV Tau variable. The post-AGB stars of this category are located on
the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram in (or near) the instability strip and have near-IR excesses,
which serves as evidence for the presence of warm circumstellar dust that has not yet detached
from the photospheric layers of the star.

The abundances of chemical elements in the atmosphere of V340 Ser have been studied
repeatedly and quite reliably. Based on high-resolution spectra, but with a moderate S/N
ratio, Arellano Ferro et al. (2001) derived the model atmosphere parameters for this star:
Teﬀ = 7300 K, surface gravity log g = 1.25, and microturbulence ξt = 4.6 km/s. They found a
lowered metallicity, [Fe/H]⊙=−0.60, an overabundance of heavy s-process elements, and a
carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio C/O≈1. As a result, these authors supported the previous
conclusion (van Winckel, 1997) that the star belongs to the post-AGB stars that have passed
the third dredge-up.

The paper by Arellano Ferro et al. (2001) is also important in that its authors pointed
out the absence of selective depletion of chemical elements in the atmosphere of this star,
which usually distorts the elemental abundances in the atmospheres of related post-AGB stars
(for examples, see Klochkova (1995), Giridhar et al. (2000), Rao et al. (2012), Klochkova and
Tavolzhanskaya (2019)).

Based on high-resolution spectra, Rao et al. (2012) determined the model parameters and
detailed atmospheric chemical composition for a sample of post-AGB stars, including V340 Ser.
The model parameters adopted by them for this star are, i.e., Teﬀ = 7300±150 K, surface gravity
log g = 2.25±0.25, and microturbulence ξt= 4.7±0.25 km s, agree, within the error limits, with
the previously derived parameters from Arellano Ferro et al. (2001). At a lowered metallicity,
[Fe/H]⊙=−0.60, a nontrivial atmospheric chemical composition was found for V340 Ser: mod-
erate, but signiﬁcant enhancements of α-process elements, [α/Fe]=+0.44, and heavy s-process
metals, [s/Fe]=+0.69.

Later, using VLT+UVES spectra, de Smedt et al. (2016) again conﬁrmed the parameters
and chemical abundances of V340 Ser. The main goal of their study, the search for evidence
of lead in the atmospheres of the program stars, was not achieved, because for 14 post-AGB
stars with heavy-metal-enriched atmospheres the authors obtained only upper limits for the
abundance of this element. The paper of these authors is important in our study of the optical
spectra for V340 Ser, because, having performed a spectroscopic monitoring with the HERMES
spectrograph of the 1.2-m telescope, de Smedt et al. (2016) concluded that this star is a binary
by determining its orbital parameters. The period found by them is P = 365 days, the systemic
velocity is γ = 56.8 ± 0.5 km/s, and the velocity amplitude is ∆V r = 7.92 ± 0.44 km/s.

The behavior of the photometric parameters for V340 Ser has also been studied reliably.
Having performed a 7-year-long UBV monitoring of the star, Arkhipova et al. (2011) concluded
that its brightness is variable with an amplitude ∆V ≈ 0.2m typical of post-AGB stars and a
fundamental period P = 89.6 days. Appending the ASAS data distributed more uniformly in
time to their analysis, Arkhipova et al. (2011) determined the amplitude, ∆V ≈ 0.3m, and the
fundamental period, P = 89.8 days.

In this paper we present the results of our analysis of the optical spectra for V340 Ser taken
at the 6 meter BTA telescope in 2018–2020. The main goal of our work is the search for spectral
peculiarities and their variability with time. In Section 2 we brieﬂy describe the methods of
observations and data analysis. In Section 3 we present the results by comparing them with
the previously published ones and in Section 3 we provide our conclusions.

The spectra of V340 Ser were taken with the Nasmyth echelle spectrograph (NES) (Panchuk
et al. 2017) at the 6-m BTA telescope. The dates of observations of the star are listed in Table 1.
At these dates the NES was equipped with a large format 4608×2048 CCD with a pixel size
of 0.0135×0.0135 mm, the readout noise is 1.8 e−. The recorded spectral range is ∆λ = 470–
778 nm. To reduce the light losses without any loss of the spectral resolution, the NES is

4

Klochkova et al.: Optical spectroscopy of V340 Ser

equipped with an image slicer forming three slices. Each spectral order in the 2-dimensional
image of the spectrum is repeated three times with a shift along the cross dispersion. The
spectral resolution is ge60000, the signalto-noise ratio is S/N>100, it changes along the echelle
order from 100 to 150.

The one-dimensional data were extracted from the 2-dimensional echelle spectra with the
modiﬁed (taking into account the peculiarities of the NES echelle frames) ECHELLE con-
text of the MIDAS software package. The details of the procedure were described by Yushkin
and Klochkova (2005). The cosmic-ray particle hits were removed by a median averaging of
two spectra taken successively one by one. The wavelength calibration was carried out using
the spectra of a hollow-cathode Th-Ar lamp. The entire subsequent reduction, including the
photometric and positional measurements, was performed with the up-to-date version of the
DECH20t code developed by Galazutdinov (1992). Note that this code traditionally used by us
to reduce the spectra allows the radial velocities for individual features in the line proﬁles to
be measured. The systematic measurement errors of the heliocentric velocities V⊙ estimated
from sharp interstellar Na I components do not exceed 0.25 km/s (from one line); the random
errors for shallow absorptions are ≈ 0.5 km/s, the mean value per line. Thus, for the average
values of V⊙ in Table 1 the random errors are 0.05÷0.3 km/s, depending on the number of
measured lines. We identiﬁed the features in the spectrum of V340 Ser using the atlas of the
optical spectrum for the canonical post-AGB star HD 56126 (=IRAS 07134+1005, Sp = F5 Iab)
published by Klochkova et al. (2007a), which is based on the observational data of the 6-m
BTA telescope in combination with the NES.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Peculiarities of the optical spectrum for V340 Ser and radial velocity

stratiﬁcation

The spectral anomalies inherent in RV Tau stars are the emission components of the com-
plex and variable (with phase) Hα proﬁles, the HeI 5876 ˚A emission, the splitting of selected
absorptions, the multicomponent proﬁles of the NaI D lines, and the weak metal emissions
appearing at certain times of the cycle. The spectra of the prototype stars RV Tau, U Mon, and
AC Her studied by Baird (1982, 1984), Pollard et al. (1997), Klochkova and Panchuk (1998),
and Kipper and Klochkova (2013) serve as examples. Both the absorption splitting and the
emission in the HeI 5876 ˚A line are absent in our spectra of V340 Ser. The optical spectrum
of this star, which largely corresponds to the expected spectrum of an F2–3 supergiant, con-
tains some of the peculiarities listed above. First, the Hα proﬁle is complex, which is typical
of post-AGB stars. The proﬁle of this line presented in Fig. 1 in relative intensity – radial ve-
locity coordinates includes the broad absorption wings on which the absorption and emission
components are superimposed. As follows from Fig. 1, the positions of both components do not
change with time, but a weak variability of their intensity can be noted. The change in the
shape of the blue wing of the absorption component is more pronounced, reﬂecting a change
in the outﬂow velocity. A large diﬀerence between the velocities corresponding to the cores of
the emission and absorption components in the Hα proﬁle should be emphasized. As can be
seen from the data in Table 1 and Fig. 1, this diﬀerence is about 65 km/s and exceeds the same
parameter for the RV Tau stars studied by Pollard et al. (1997), including the star AD Aql, in
the spectrum of which the Hα proﬁle is close to the one recorded by us in the spectrum of
V340 Ser, by many times. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the Hβ proﬁle is a purely absorption one,

taken at diﬀerent dates: April 5, 2018 (black line), April 11, 2018 (green line), March 31, 2019
(red line), and April 2, 2020 (indigo line). The two solid vertical bars indicate the positions of
the TiI 6554.23 ˚A and CaI 6572.80 ˚A emissions. The vertical line marks the systemic velocity

it contains no visible emission features. As follows from Table 1, the position of the Hβ core
does not coincide quite closely with the positions of the atmospheric metal absorptions, it is
blueshifted by 5–6 km/s, suggesting a stratiﬁcation of the velocity pattern.

The circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars are often the sources of molecular and maser
emission, which allows their systemic velocity to be reliably recorded. However, for V340 Ser
there is no information about any envelope features in the radio band. The optical spectrum
of this star does not contain any evidence of molecules either and, therefore, we use γ =
56.8 ± 0.5 km/s from de Smedt et al. (2016) as the systemic velocity for this star.

Second, the Hα proﬁle in the spectrum of V340 Ser in Fig. 1 is a P Cyg type one. This
proﬁle type is typical of high-luminosity stars with an extended and expanding atmosphere.
Hα is formed in the upper layers of the extended stellar atmosphere. The intense absorption
component results from the absorption of radiation in the region in front of the star. The
position of the core of the absorption component (+34 km/s) points to its formation in the high
layers of the expanding atmosphere close to the circumstellar medium. The velocity of about
34 km/s diﬀers from the adopted systemic velocity, suggesting an expansion of the region in
which this absorption is formed. Such a proﬁle type is rarely encountered in the spectra of post-
AGB stars. Numerous examples of the varieties of the Hα proﬁle in the spectra of post-AGB
stars are given by Klochkova (1997), Sanchez Contreras et al. (2008), and Molina et al. (2014):
purely absorption proﬁles, complex P Cyg proﬁles, inverse P Cyg proﬁles, etc.

However, in this extensive collection of recorded proﬁles there is no proﬁle similar to the Hα
one in the spectra of V340 Ser. A variety of proﬁle types is observed in the papers by Gonzalez

et al. (1997) and Pollard et al. (1997) devoted to the spectroscopy of RV Tau stars, as in the
community of post-AGB stars as a whole. An Hα proﬁle with a strong redshifted emission
similar to the proﬁle in the spectrum of V340 Ser is encountered rarely, but, as has been noted
above, it was recorded by Pollard et al. (1997) in the spectrum of AD Aql. A signiﬁcant phase
variability of the Hα proﬁle, including the variability of the positions of both its components,
was recorded in the spectrum of this star. So far we have recorded no such signiﬁcant variability
of the positions and intensities of the Hα proﬁle components for V340 Ser. A change only in
the extent of the blue absorption wing is clearly seen in Fig. 1, tracing the variability of the
outﬂow velocity. A close Hα proﬁle type with a large velocity diﬀerence, >100 km/s, for the
absorption and emission components is also observed in the spectrum of the post-AGB star
89 Her (=IRAS 17534+2603). As an illustration, Fig. 3 shows a fragment of the spectrum for
89 Her taken on June 3, 2010, with the NES at the BTA telescope.

We see the inﬂuence of the wind distorting the blue wings of the strong SiII(2) 6347 and
6371 ˚A absorptions in the spectrum of V340 Ser in the right fragment of Fig. 4, where the
FeI 6359 ˚A emission and the λ = 6376 and 6379 ˚A DIBs are also marked. The distortion of the
SiII(2) 6347 and 6371 ˚A absorption wings in the proﬁles in relative intensity – radial velocity
coordinates is also illustrated by Fig. 5. Here the absorption cores of both proﬁles are shifted
relative to the adopted systemic velocity, but their positions agrees well with the velocity from
diﬀerent metal absorptions in the spectrum: in Table 1 for this date V⊙(abs) = 60.09 km/s.

Having obtained the set of radial velocities for V340 Ser by the cross-correlation method, de
Smedt et al. (2016) concluded that the star is binary and classiﬁed V340 Ser as a spectroscopic
binary with a period of 365 days. Later, using the same technique, Oomen et al. (2018) improved
the orbital elements for a sample of post-AGB stars in binary systems. For V340 Ser they provide

amplitude K =8.4±1.0 km/s.

Note two points. First, having high-quality spectra of this star, we found no evidence of
spectroscopic binarity. Second, as follows from the data in Table 1, having taken the spectra
of V340 Ser at arbitrary dates in 2018–2020, we recorded no radial velocity variability in the
star expected from the results by de Smedt et al. (2016) and Oomen et al. (2018). Given the
period about 1 year, we can assume that all our spectra were taken at close orbital phases.

of V340 Ser. The vertical line marks the systemic velocity γ = 56.8 ± 0.5 km/s (de Smedt et
al., 2016).

The necessity of continuing the spectral observations of V340 Ser and a detailed study of the
variability of the velocity pattern is obvious.

3.2. Metal emissions

The spectral fragments in Fig. 4 illustrate the following peculiarity of the optical spectrum for
V340 Ser that has not been noted previously in publications: the presence of weak emissions
of neutral metals with a low excitation potential of the lower level. Two such emissions in the
Hα wings are also clearly seen in Fig. 1. Table 2 lists all of such emissions identiﬁed by us in
the recorded wavelength range. The last column in this table gives the velocities corresponding
to the position of the emission feature. As follows from the data in Table 1, the mean veloc-
ity from the emissions changes insigniﬁcantly from date to date, from V⊙(em) =45.0±0.2 to
48.0±0.4 km/s. For each date V⊙(em) diﬀers systematically by ≥ 10 km/s from the mean ve-
locity inferred from the absorptions, suggesting a velocity stratiﬁcation in the extended stellar
atmosphere. The full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of these emissions forming in the outer
layers of the extended atmosphere of V340 Ser are about 0.25 ˚A or δV⊙ ≈ 10 ÷ 12 km/s, which
is twice the FWHM of the forbidden ionospheric [OI] emissions in the spectrum. It should be
emphasized that emissions are also present in several ion lines, for example, NdII 5102, YII 5509
and EuII 6645 ˚A. This peculiarity can aﬀect the abundances of chemical elements and, therefore,
it should be conﬁrmed in subsequent observations.

Such low-excitation emissions of neutral metals were previously recorded in the spectra of
the post-AGB candidates LN Hya (=IRAS 12538−2611) (Klochkova and Panchuk, 2012) and
V1648 Aql (Klochkova and Tavolzhanskaya, 2019), whose spectral types are close to that of
V340 Ser. For LN Hya metal emissions appeared in the spectra taken at its active phases in 2010,
when the inverse P Cyg proﬁle for the metal lines diﬀered signiﬁcantly from the one observed
at quiescent phases. The position of the Hα absorption component also diﬀered signiﬁcantly
from its position at other dates of observations. Furthermore, the Hα core was signiﬁcantly
(approximately by 15 km/s) redshifted relative to the symmetric metal absorptions.

The spectrum of the above mentioned post-AGB star 89 Her also contains a lot of low exci-
tation emissions, as was already noted previously by Waters et al. (1993). As an illustration,
Fig. 3 presents a fragment with narrow emissions of the spectrum for this star taken with the
NES. Emissions of metal atoms were also recorded in the 1980-s in the spectra of RV Tau stars.
We will also add the paper by Bopp (1984), whose author emphasized the appearance of such
emissions during deep minima of the star R Sct, which also belongs to RV Tau stars, to the
already mentioned papers by Baird (1982, 1984) and Klochkova and Panchuk (1998).

Some of the Fe, Co, and Ni emissions from Table 2 are also presented in the spectrum of the
yellow hypergiant ρ Cas with an extended envelope (for details and references, see Klochkova
et al. 2018). Besides, in the spectrum of ρ Cas the mean velocity from these emissions changes
insigniﬁcantly with time and diﬀers little from the systemic velocity of the hypergiant. The low
width of these emissions in the spectrum of ρ Cas and the coincidence of the velocities suggest
that these weak emissions are formed in the outer extended gaseous envelope whose sizes exceed
considerably the photometric radius of the star. Emissions are observed predominantly in the
periods of brightness decline in ρ Cas, which may point to a relative stability of the emission
measure observed against the background of a weakened photospheric spectrum.

3.3. DIBs and the multicomponent proﬁle of the NaI D lines

Despite its signiﬁcant distance from the Galactic plane (the Galactic latitude of the star
|b| > 12◦), numerous interstellar features were detected in the optical spectrum of V340 Ser. In
particular, two such features with wavelengths λ = 6376 and 6379 ˚A are clearly seen in Fig. 4.

tures the table gives the radial velocity corresponding to the DIBs positions and their equivalent

Figure 6. NaI 5889 and 5895 ˚A line proﬁles (dots) in the spectrum of V340 Ser. The positions
of the proﬁle absorption components forming in the interstellar medium (1), the circumstellar
medium (2 and 3), and the stellar atmosphere (4) are marked. The vertical line marks the
systemic velocity γ = 56.8 ± 0.5 km/s (de Smedt et al., 2016).

A high quality of our spectra for V340 Ser allowed us to resolve the NaI 5889 and 5895 ˚A D
lines into components and to measure the position of the interstellar KI 7696 ˚A absorption.
Individual absorptions, whose average positions are given in Table 1 and Fig. 6, are conﬁdently
distinguished in the NaI 5889 and 5895 ˚A lines proﬁle in our spectra. The position of the long-
wavelength absorption component (designated as 4 in this ﬁgure) for each date of observations
agrees, within the above error limits, with the mean velocity V⊙(abs) measured from a large
set of metal absorptions. Such agreement suggests the formation of this NaI D line component
in the stellar atmosphere.

According to the data from Table 1, the position of the shortest-wavelength component 1 of
the NaI doublet lines, V⊙ = −11.3 km s, is stable. Given the measurement errors, its position
coincides with the average velocity from the set of DIBs identiﬁed in the spectrum, suggesting
that this NaI doublet component is formed in the interstellar medium. In Fig. 6 we can see a
diﬀering steepness of the component wings, which also conﬁrms the proposed interpretation of
their formation regions.

Components 2 and 3 of the NaI D lines with velocities V⊙=+10.1 and +33.7 km/s are
redshifted relative to the mean radial velocity V⊙(abs) from the photospheric absorptions. It is
natural to assume that both these components are formed in the circumstellar medium and the
outer layers of the expanding stellar atmosphere. The component with a velocity of 10.1 km/s is

formed in an envelope expanding with a velocity typical of the envelopes of post-AGB stars (for
comparison, see the results by Bakker et al. (1995, 1997) and Klochkova (2014)). The component
with a velocity of 33.7 km/s is formed in the uppermost layers of the stellar atmosphere that
pass into the circumstellar medium undetached from the star. The absorption of the complex
Hα proﬁle is also formed here. These layers move with a velocity ≈23 km/s relative to the deep
atmospheric layers, where symmetric absorptions are formed. The multicomponent proﬁle of
the NaI doublet lines also contains the emission component 5 exceeding the local continuum in
Fig. 6. The position of this emission, V⊙ ≈ 104 km/s, is close to the position of the Hα emission
component.

Note the intensity ratio of the components in the NaI D1 (5895 ˚A) and D2 (5889 ˚A) lines.
If the corresponding NaI atomic levels are populated proportionally to the statistical weights,
then the D2/D1 ratio in the emission spectrum must be 2. In the spectra of V340 Ser the
emission feature 5 is clearly seen in the D2 line and is at the detection limit in the D1 line. As
the number density of NaI atoms rises, the role of the resonant scattering and self-absorption
processes increases and, as a result, the intensity ratio of the NaI emission doublet lines will
tend to 1.

In the spectra of stellar atmospheres we observe the D1 and D2 absorptions of equal inten-
sities (for example, component 4 in Fig. 6). As a rule, a similar picture is also observed in the

Klochkova et al.: Optical spectroscopy of V340 Ser

13

spectra of the interstellar medium (for example, component 1 in Fig. 6), suggesting a satura-
tion of the NaI doublet absorption proﬁles 4 and 1 due to self-absorption. In the spectra of
the circumstellar envelopes of V340 Ser the intensity ratios of the doublet absorption compo-
nents diﬀers signiﬁcantly: ≈1.3 and 1.5 for components 2 and 3, respectively. We conclude that
no saturation in the line cores has been achieved for both emission feature 5 and absorption
features 2 and 3.

Such a multicomponent proﬁle of the NaI D lines with a fragment of the long-wavelength
emission was recorded previously by Klochkova and Chentsov (2004) in the spectrum of the
post-AGB star V510 Pup (=IRAS 08005−2356). This star has evolved farther from the AGB
than V340 Ser and, therefore, has a detached envelope, which manifests itself, in particular, in
the presence of circumstellar Swan C2 absorption bands. Furthermore, emission from the OH
bands simultaneously at 1612 and 1667 MHz was recorded for the source IRAS 08005−2356,
which, according to Lewis (1989), in the absence of SiO and H2O masers suggests that the
object approaches the planetary nebula stage. Note that in the spectrum of V510 Pup Klochkova
and Chentsov (2004) identiﬁed the forbidden [CaII] 7291 and 7324 ˚A doublet emissions rarely
observed in the spectra of post-AGB stars. These low excitation forbidden emissions are typical
for the spectra of stars of selected types with a mass outﬂow and serve as evidence for the
presence of a circumstellar disk. In particular, these emissions were identiﬁed in the spectra
of the yellow supergiants V1302 Aql (=IRC+10420) (Klochkova et al. 1999) and V509 Cas
(=IRC+60379) (Aret et al. 2017; Klochkova et al. 2019; Klochkova 2019) and the spectra of B
supergiants with the B[e] phenomenon (Aret et al. 2012). In the spectra of V340 Ser we also see
an emission that could be identiﬁed with the forbidden 7291 ˚A line, which could point to the
probable presence of a circumstellar disk in the system. Unfortunately, the second line of this
doublet, [CaII] 7324 ˚A, which could conﬁrm the presence of a forbidden emission, falls between
adjacent orders in our echelle frame. Additional observations are needed to conﬁrm the presence
of this important spectral feature. At present, we have to identify the 7291 ˚A emission in the
spectrum with the low xcitation NiI line with λ=7291.449 ˚A.

Emission components in the NaI resonance lines with a FWHM ∆ ≈ 120 km/s were recorded
by Klochkova et al. (2006) in the spectrum of the cool variable AGB star associated with the
IR source IRAS 20508+2011. The multicomponent proﬁle of the NaI D lines in the spectrum
of the semiregular variable QY Sge is even more interesting. A broad emission with a FWHM
∆ ≈ 120 km/s was recorded by Menzies and Whitelock (1988), who assumed that the formation
region of the emission in the resonance lines is a fairly hot and inhomogeneous circumstellar
envelope, while the large emission width is due to the scattering of photons by moving dust
grains in the envelope. Having recorded both broad and narrow metal emissions in the spectrum
of QY Sge, Rao et al. (2002) developed the assumption of Menzies and Whitelock (1988) by
proposing a model with a circumstellar torus and bipolar jets. Subsequently, based on their
spectroscopic monitoring of QY Sge, Klochkova et al. (2007b) conﬁrmed the conclusion about
the emission formation in the circumstellar medium by showing the stability of its position in
time.

3.4. Distance to the star and its luminosity

We will estimate the luminosity of the star using the luminosity – OI 7774 ˚A triplet intensity
criterion known for F-G supergiants. In the spectra of V340 Ser the total equivalent width of
the oxygen triplet is Wλ(7774) = 1.25 ˚A, which is a typical value for post-AGB stars (for com-
parison, see the data from Molina et al. (2018)). The luminosity estimate for V340 Ser from

14

Klochkova et al.: Optical spectroscopy of V340 Ser

Wλ(7774) is fairly accurate, because, according to van Winckel (1997), there is no oxygen abun-
dance anomaly in the atmosphere of this star. Applying the calibration Mv←→ Wλ(7774) from
Takeda et al. (2018), we get an absolute magnitude Mv≈ −4.6m for V340 Ser. The luminosity
of V340 Ser derived in this way, logL/L⊙= 3.75, agrees well with its spectral classiﬁcation and
the luminosity expected from the theoretical views of Bl¨ocker (1995b) about the evolutionary
status of post-AGB stars.

To estimate the color excess E(B − V ) due to the interstellar extinction, we used the equiv-
alent widths Wλ(DIBs) measured in the spectra of V340 Ser for a sample of DIBs and the
calibration relations E(B − V ) ←→ Wλ(DIBs) from Kos and Zwitter (2013). Invoking seven
conﬁdently measured bands from Table 3 (4984, 5780, 5797, 6196, 6203, 6379, 6613 ˚A), for
which the calibration relations by Kos and Zwitter (2013) are available, we found the mean
color excess to be E(B − V ) = 0.59m. This color excess is deﬁnitely below the total reddening
E(B − V ), because some fraction of the stellar reddening is also attributable to the extinction
in the circumstellar medium. As follows from Fig. 6, the intensity of the circumstellar compo-
nents 2 and 3 is only slightly lower than that of the interstellar one, suggesting a signiﬁcant
contribution of the circumstellar extinction to the total reddening E(B − V ).

By modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) for V340 Ser, de Smedt et al. (2016)
estimated the total reddening: E(B − V ) = 0.76m. With this estimate of the color excess we
ﬁnd the total extinction to be Av≈ 2.43m (for the standard ratio R = 3.2). Taking into account
the mean apparent magnitude V = 9.63m from Arkhipova et al. (2011), we estimate the distance
to the star to be d≈2.3 kpc. The distance estimate d≈3.43 kpc for V340 Ser from the extensive
catalogue by Vickers et al. (2015) should be mentioned here. While modeling the SED for
post-AGB stars, these authors adopted the luminosity range L/L⊙ = 6000 ± 1500 for them.
Our luminosity estimate for V340 Ser from the IR oxygen triplet lies within this range. While
modeling the SED, Vickers et al. (2015) took into account the anomalous SED pattern for
IRAS 17279−1119 due to the presence of warm (≈855 K) and cold (≈171 K) dust. At the same
time, Vickers et al. (2015) found the reddening to be E(B − V )=0.45m, which is considerably
lower than the reddening from de Smedt et al. (2016) and even lower than the interstellar
reddening fraction derived by us from DIBs.

The Gaia DR2 catalogue (2018) gives a reliable parallax for V340 Ser, π=0.1577±0.0427 mas,
which leads to a signiﬁcant distance of the star: d≥6.3 kpc. However, in the 2016 version the
data for the star diﬀer signiﬁcantly: π=0.340±0.260 mas. This parallax gives a distance to the
star close to our estimate, but the parallax accuracy is too low. Here we should allude to the
paper by Xu et al. (2019), in which they compared the Gaia DR2 parallaxes with the VLBI
data and noted a large diﬀerence in these data for AGB stars with extended dust envelopes.
Furthermore, the large parallax oﬀset for Gaia DR2 relative to VLBI, −0.075±0.029 mas (Xu
et al. 2019), should be taken into account for distant objects.

On the whole, it can be asserted that the set of parameters for V340 Ser, i.e., its luminosity,
distance from the Galactic plane, lowered metallicity, and chemical peculiarities, is consistent
with its belonging to the post-AGB stage in the Galactic thick disk. Note that the set of
main parameters and chemical composition of V340 Ser allows this star to be included in the
homogeneous group of post-AGB stars with large enhancements of carbon and heavy s-process
metals identiﬁed by Klochkova (1997) and van Winckel and Reyniers (2000). All stars of this
group have structured, often bipolar, envelopes, where a lot of molecular and maser features are
formed. Furthermore, an as yet unidentiﬁed emission at 21µ is contained in the IR spectra of
all these stars (for more details, see Hrivnak et al. 2009). The circumstellar medium of V340 Ser
has no these features, i.e., its envelope has not yet detached from the stars and has not cooled

Klochkova et al.: Optical spectroscopy of V340 Ser

15

to the requires extent. Hrivnak et al. (2009) suggest that the feature at 21µ is formed in the
IR spectra of post-AGB stars with cold dust envelopes, with a temperature ≈120–150 K.

It is necessary to check whether V340 Ser belongs to RV Tau stars, because a star with the
main parameters Teﬀ= 7200 K and log L/L⊙=3.75 lies outside the instability strip, according
to the data by Kiss et al. (2007). Recall that, previously, Arkhipova et al. (2011) also questioned
this status of V340 Ser, while Si`odmiak et al. (2008) classiﬁed V340 Ser as a post-AGB star,
but not as an RV Tau one.

4. CONCLUSIONS

We studied the optical spectra of V340 Ser (=IRAS 17279−1119) taken at the 6-m BTA tele-
scope with a spectral resolution R≥60000. For four dates we measured the heliocentric radial ve-
locity from numerous metal absorptions (from 300 to 550 lines): V⊙= 59.30±0.05, 60.09±0.05,
58.46±0.06, and 55.78±0.06 km/s. Given the high accuracy of the velocity, these values of point
to a weak variability of the velocity with time.

The interstellar, V⊙=−11.20 km/s, and circumstellar, V⊙=+10 km/s, components and the
component forming in the uppermost atmospheric layers, V⊙=+34.0 km/s, were identiﬁed in
the NaI D line proﬁle. The values averaged over four spectra have an accuracy of ±0.2 km/s.
The mean velocity from 20–30 DIBs identiﬁed in the spectra, V⊙(DIBs)=−11.6±0.2 km/s,
coincides with the velocity from the interstellar NaI component.

The Hα line has a P Cyg type proﬁle, with the position of its absorption component

(V⊙=+34 km/s) pointing to its formation in the upper layers of the expanding atmosphere.

The weak emissions with an intensity ≈10% of the local continuum level were identiﬁed with
low excitation lines of metal atoms. Their stable positions, V⊙=46.3±0.4 km/s, systematically
diﬀer from the velocity inferred from atmospheric absorptions, suggesting the presence of a
velocity gradient in the upper layers of the stellar atmosphere.

Based on the equivalent width triplet Wλ(7774)=1.25 ˚A of the IR oxygen, we estimated
the absolute magnitude to be Mv≈ −4.6m, which, when taking into account the total (in
the interstellar and circumstellar media) extinction, leads to a distance estimate for the star
d≈2.3 kpc. This value is half the distance corresponding to the parallax of V340 Ser from DR2
Gaia (2018). Such a diﬀerence can be a consequence of the correction for the extinction in the
interstellar medium and the object’s circumstellar environment.

It is necessary to check whether V340 Ser belongs to RV Tau type stars, because a star with

the main parameters Teﬀ = 7200 K and log L/L⊙= 3.75 lies outside the instability strip.
