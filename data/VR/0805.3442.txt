ABSTRACT
Using the NIRSPEC spectrograph at Keck II, we have obtained infrared echelle spec-
tra covering the 1.5 − 1.8 µm range for giant stars in the massive bulge globular
clusters NGC 6440 and NGC 6441. We report the ﬁrst high dispersion abundance for
NGC 6440, [Fe/H]=−0.56±0.02 and we ﬁnd [Fe/H]=−0.50±0.02 for the blue HB clus-
ter NGC 6441. We measure an average α-enhancement of ≈ +0.3 dex in both clusters,
consistent with previous measurements of other metal rich bulge clusters, and favor-
ing the scenario of a rapid bulge formation and chemical enrichment. We also measure
very low 12C/13C isotopic ratios (≈ 5 ± 1), suggesting that extra-mixing mechanisms
are at work during evolution along the Red Giant Branch also in the high metallic-
ity regime. We also measure Al abundances, ﬁnding average [Al/Fe] = 0.45 ± 0.02
and [Al/Fe] = 0.52 ± 0.02 in NGC 6440 and NGC 6441, respectively, and some Mg-
Al anti-correlation in NGC 6441. We also measure radial velocities vr=–76±3 km/s
and vr=+14±3 km/s and velocity dispersions σ=9±2 km/s and σ=10±2 km/s, in
NGC 6440 and NGC 6441, respectively.

Key words: Galaxy: bulge, globular clusters: individual (NGC 6440 and NGC 6441)

INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years we have been undertaking a high-
resolution spectroscopic survey of the Galactic bulge in
the near-IR using NIRSPEC, a high throughput infrared
(IR) echelle spectrograph at the Keck Observatory (McLean
1998). The near IR spectral range is well suited to mea-
sure the obscured stellar populations in the inner Galaxy.
H–band (1.5–1.8 µm) spectra of bright giants in the bulge
globular clusters and ﬁeld population are ideal for detailed
abundance analysis of Fe, C, O and other α-elements, using
the approach of synthesizing the entire spectrum. The abun-
dance distributions in the cluster and ﬁeld populations are
important in constraining the history and timescale of bulge
formation and chemical enrichment (Rich 1990; McWilliam
1997; Matteucci, Romano & Molaro 199r98).

We have used this method to derive abundances for

vatory, which is operated as a scientiﬁc partnership among the
California Institute of Technology, the University of California,

servatory was made possible by the generous ﬁnancial support of

eight bulge globular clusters in the inner and outer bulge: the
resulting abundances for NGC 6553 and Liller 1 are given in
Origlia, Rich & Castro (2002), for Terzan 4 and Terzan 5
in Origlia & Rich (2004), for NGC 6342 and NGC6528
in Origlia, Valenti & Rich (2005), and for NGC 6539 and
UKS 1 in Origlia et al. (2005). We also measured de-
tailed abundances of bulge giants in the Baade’s window
(Rich & Origlia 2005) and in the inner ﬁeld at (l, b) =
(0, −1) (Rich, Origlia & Valenti 2007).

We ﬁnd α-enhancement at a level of a factor between
2 and 3 over the whole range of metallicity spanned by the
bulge clusters in our survey, from [Fe/H]≈–1.6 (cf. Terzan 4)
up to [Fe/H]≈–0.2 (cf. Terzan 5). Such an enhancement
has been also found in the observed bulge ﬁelds, without
any evidence of vertical abundance and abundance pattern
gradients.

In this paper we present the high resolution IR spectra
and the abundance analysis of bright giants in NGC 6440
and NGC 6441, two massive bulge globular clusters of
the inner bulge, located at (l, b) = (7.7, 3.8) and (l, b) =
(353.5, −5.0), respectively (Harris 1996).

During the 1990s, NGC 6440 has been photomet-
rically observed in the optical (Ortolani, Barbuy & Bica

near IR photometry, giving very similar [Fe/H]=-0.49 and
slightly higher E(B-V)=1.15, but in very good agreement

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

Near infrared, high-resolution echelle spectra of bright gi-
ants in the core of the bulge globular clusters NGC 6440
and NGC 6441 have been acquired with the infrared spec-
trograph NIRSPEC (McLean 1998) mounted at the Nas-
myth focus of the Keck II telescope. The high resolution

′′
43 (3 pixels) and a
echelle mode, with a slit width of 0.
′′
length of 12-24
and the standard NIRSPEC-5 setting,
which covers most of the 1.5–1.8 micron H-band, have been
selected. Typical exposure times (on source) are ≈8 min-
utes. NGC 6440 was observed on July 2003 and April 2007,
while NGC 6441 on July and 2002 and May 2006. A to-
tal of 10 and 8 giants have been measured, respectively.
Figs. 1, 2 show the IR image and the color-magnitude dia-
gram (Valenti, Ferraro & Origlia 2004) of the central region
of NGC 6440 and NGC 6441, respectively, with marked the
giant stars spectroscopically observed. The selected stars are
within a magnitude from the RGB Tip, that is suﬃciently
bright to give a good signal to noise in a relatively short
integration time and suﬀucently below the nominal RGB
tip in order to minimize possible contamination by brighter
AGB stars. Moreover, the selection of stars in the core region
maximizes the membership probability, although a spectro-
scopic conﬁrmation is always required. In NGC 6441 we also
selected two stars (our # 7 and #8, right panel of Fig. 2) in
common with Gratton et al. (2006) sample (their #7004050
and #7004434, respectively) for comparison, which lie in a
more external ﬁeld.

The raw two dimensional spectra were processed using
the REDSPEC IDL-based package written at the UCLA IR
Laboratory. Each order has been sky subtracted by using
the pairs of spectra taken with the object nodded along the
slit, and subsequently ﬂat-ﬁeld corrected. Wavelength cali-
bration has been performed using arc lamps and a second
order polynomial solution, while telluric features have been
removed by dividing by the featureless spectrum of an O
star. At the NIRSPEC resolution of R=25,000 several single
roto-vibrational OH lines and CO bandheads can be mea-
sured to derive accurate oxygen and carbon abundances.
Other metal abundances can be derived from the atomic
lines of Fe I, Mg I, Si I, Ti I and Ca I. Abundance analysis

is performed by using full spectral synthesis techniques and
equivalent width measurements of representative lines.

3 ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS

We compute suitable synthetic spectra of giant stars by
varying the stellar parameters and the element abundances
using an updated version (Origlia, Rich & Castro 2002) of
the code described in Origlia, Moorwood & Oliva (1993).
The main features of the code and overall spectral syn-
thesis procedure have been widely discussed and tested in
our previous papers and they will not be repeated here. We
only mention that the code uses the LTE approximation and
is based on the molecular blanketed model atmospheres of
Johnson, Bernat & Krupp (1980) at temperatures 64000 K
and the ATLAS9 models for temperatures above 4000 K.
The reference solar abundances are from Grevesse & Sauval
(1998).

Photometric estimates of the stellar parameters are ini-
tially used as input to produce a grid of model spectra, al-
lowing the abundances and abundance patterns to vary over
a large range and the stellar parameters around the photo-
metric values. The model which better reproduces the over-
all observed spectrum and the equivalent widths of selected
lines is chosen as the best ﬁt model. We measure equivalent
widths in the observed spectrum, in the best ﬁt model and
in four additional models which are, respectively, ±0.1 and
±0.2 dex away from the best-ﬁtting, as a further cross-check
of the inferred abundances and overall uncertainties listed
in Tables 1,2.

Stellar parameter uncertainty of ±200 K in temperature
−1 in
(Tef f ), ±0.5 dex in log-gravity (log g) and ±0.5 km s
microturbulence velocity (ξ), can introduce a further sys-
tematic 60.2 dex uncertainty in the absolute abundances.
However, since the CO and OH molecular line proﬁles are

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–8

very sensitive to eﬀective temperature, gravity, and micro-
turbulence variations, they constrain better the values of
these parameters, signiﬁcantly reducing their initial range of
variation and ensuring a good self-consistency of the overall
spectral synthesis procedure (Origlia, Rich & Castro 2002;
Origlia & Rich 2004).

Solutions with ∆Teﬀ = ±200 K, ∆log g=±0.5 dex and
−1 and corresponding ±0.2 dex abundance
∆ξ= ∓0.5 km s
variations from the best-ﬁtting one are indeed less sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (typically at 1 6 σ 6 3 level only,
Origlia & Rich (2004)). Moreover, since the stellar features
under consideration show a similar trend with variation in
the stellar parameters, although with diﬀerent sensitivity,
relative abundances are less dependent on stellar param-
eter assumptions, reducing the systematic uncertainty to
<0.1 dex.

4 RESULTS

By combining full spectral synthesis analysis with equiv-
alent width measurements, we derive abundances of Fe,
C, O and 12C/13C for the observed giants in NGC 6440
and NGC 6441. The abundances of additional α−elements,
namely Ca, Si, Mg and Ti, are obtained by measuring a few
major atomic lines. The 12C/13C isotopic ratio has been
determined by using the 12CO and 13CO second overtone
bandheads in the H band spectrum covered by our observa-
tions and a few isolated single roto-vibrational lines.

The near-IR spectra of cool stars also contain many
CN molecular lines. However, at the NIRSPEC resolution
most of these lines are faint and blended with the stronger
CO, OH and atomic lines, making diﬃcult to impossible a
reliable estimate of the nitrogen abundance.

Stellar temperatures are both estimated from the (J −

K)0 colors and molecular lines, gravity from theoretical evo-
lutionary tracks, according to the location of the stars on
the Red Giant Branch (RGB), and adopting an average mi-
croturbulence velocity of 2.0 km/s (see also Origlia et al.
1997). Equivalent widths are computed by Gaussian ﬁtting
the line proﬁles, typical values being a few hundreds m˚A, and
the overall uncertainty 610%. A table (see Table 3 with the
measured equivalent widths of representative lines for the
observed stars in NGC 6440 and NGC 6441 is available in
electronic form.

In order to check further the statistical signiﬁcance of
our best-ﬁtting solution, we compute synthetic spectra with
∆Teﬀ = ±200 K, ∆log g=±0.5 dex and ∆ξ= ∓0.5 km s−1,
and with corresponding simultaneous variations of ±0.2 dex
of the C and O abundances to reproduce the depth of the
molecular features. We follow the strategy illustrated in
Origlia & Rich (2004). As a ﬁgure of merit we adopt the
diﬀerence between the model and the observed spectrum
(hereafter δ). In order to quantify systematic discrepancies,
this parameter is more powerful than the classical χ2 test,
which is instead equally sensitive to random and systematic
scatters.

Since δ is expected to follow a Gaussian distribution,
we compute δ and the corresponding standard deviation
for our best-ﬁtting solution and the other models with the
stellar parameter and abundance variations quoted above.
We then extract 10,000 random subsamples from each test
model (assuming a Gaussian distribution) and we compute
the probability P that a random realization of the data-
points around a test model display a δ that is compatible
with an ideal best-ﬁtting model with a δ=0. P ≃ 1 indicates
that the model is a good representation of the observed spec-
trum. The statistical tests are performed on portions of the
spectra mainly containing the CO bandheads and the OH
lines which are the most sensitive to the stellar parameters.

4.1 NGC 6440

In order to obtain a photometric estimate of the stellar tem-
peratures and the bolometric magnitudes we use the near IR
photometry by Valenti, Ferraro & Origlia (2004) and their
E(B-V)=1.15 reddening and (m-M)0=14.58 distance modu-
lus. We also use the color-temperature transformations and
bolometric corrections of Montegriﬀo et al. (1998), speciﬁ-
cally calibrated for globular cluster giants. We constrain ef-
fective temperatures in the range 3500–4000 K, and we esti-
mate bolometric magnitudes Mbol 6 −3.2 (see Table 1). The
ﬁnal adopted temperatures, obtained by best-ﬁtting the CO
and in particular the OH molecular bands which are espe-
cially temperature sensitive in cool giants, are also reported
in Table 1.

Fig. 3 shows our synthetic best ﬁt superimposed on the
observed spectra of giant #4 in NGC 6440. From our over-
all spectral analysis we ﬁnd average [Fe/H]= −0.50 ± 0.02,
[O/Fe]= 0.33 ± 0.02 and [α/Fe] = 0.34 ± 0.02 (see Table 1).
We also measure an average carbon depletion ([C/Fe]=–
0.36±0.03 dex) and low 12C/13C ≈ 4.6 ± 0.7 isotopic ratio.
Our best-ﬁtting solutions have an average probability
P >0.99 to be statistically representative of the observed
spectra. The other test models with diﬀerent assumptions for

level.

From the NIRSPEC spectra we also derived stellar he-
liocentric radial velocities (see Table 1), ﬁnding an average
value vr = −74±4 km/s with a dispersion σ = 11 ± 3 km/s.
By excluding star #5, which is the most discrepant, we ﬁnd
vr = −76±3 km/s and σ = 9 ± 2 km/s. These values are in
good agreement with the one quoted in Harris (1996).

4.2 NGC 6441

We use the near IR photometry of Valenti, Ferraro & Origlia
(2004) and their E(B-V)=0.52 reddening and (m-M)0=15.65
distance modulus. We ﬁnd photometric temperatures in the
3800-4200 K range and bolometric magnitudes between -2.0
and -4.1 (see Table 2). The ﬁnal adopted temperatures, ob-
tained by best-ﬁtting the CO and the OH molecular bands,
are also reported in Table 2.

Fig. 4 shows our synthetic best-ﬁtting superimposed on
the observed spectra of giant #5 in NGC 6441. For this
cluster our abundance analysis gives an average [Fe/H]=
−0.50 ± 0.02,
[O/Fe]= +0.27 ± 0.02 and an overall av-
erage [α/Fe] = 0.28 ± 0.02. We also measure an aver-
age carbon depletion ([C/Fe]=–0.45±0.06 dex) and a low
12C/13C≈ 5.4 ± 0.9.

Our iron abundance for stars #7 and #8 is only 0.10 dex
lower and our average abundance 0.11 dex lower than in
Gratton et al. (2006), so fully consistent within the er-
rors. Our estimates for the other abundances are also sim-
ilar (within ±0.1 dex) with those quoted by Gratton et al.
(2006). Only Ca, which is rather low in Gratton et al. (2006)
compared to the other α-elements, is somewhat more dis-

crepant (≈0.2 dex) but still barely consistent within the er-
rors.

In order to further check the robustness of our best-
ﬁtting solutions, the same statistical test done for NGC 6440
has been repeated here. Our best-ﬁtting solutions have an
average probability P >0.99 to be statistically representa-
tive of the observed spectra, while the other test models are
only signiﬁcant at > 1 σ level.

By measuring the stellar radial velocities (see Table 2)
we ﬁnd an average vr = +13±3 km/s with a dispersion
σ = 10 ± 2 km/s, somewhat lower, but still in reasonable
agreement within the errors, with the values proposed by
Gratton et al. (2007) based on a sample of stars three times
larger, namely vr=+21 km/s and σ=13 km/s. Our radial
velocity is in excellent agreement with the vr=+15 km/s
estimated by Dubath, Meylan & Mayor (1997).

4.3 Aluminum lines

The Al doublet at λλ1.67506, 1.67634 is at one side of the
NIRSPEC-5 echellogram and easily measurable measurable
in stars with positive radial velocities as for the giants in

NGC 6441, while only the reddest line is barely measurable
in the giants of NGC 6440. These lines have been proved
to be reliable Al abundance indicators, having relatively
high excitation potential and forming quite deeply in the
stellar atmospheres, where the LTE regime still dominates,
even in giants with low temperatures and gravities (see e.g.
Baum¨uller & Gehren 1996). When available, the two lines of
the doublet provide very similar Al abundances within the
errors. However, since the λ1.67506 line is very close to the
edge of the echellogram, we only use it as a double check of
the Al abundance obtained from the λ1.67634.

Figs.5,6 show the observed spectra in the Al region with
overimposed our best ﬁt. The spectra of stars #2 and #3 in
NGC 6440 were too noisy at 1.67 µm to be used for reliable
Al abundance determinations.

We ﬁnd average [Al/Fe] = 0.45 ± 0.02 and [Al/Fe] =
0.52 ± 0.02 in NGC 6440 and NGC 6441, respectively (see
also Tables 1 and 2). Fig.7 shows the plot of the [Mg/Fe] vs
[Al/Fe] distribution for the two clusters. Although our sam-
ples are too small to draw ﬁrm conclusions, we ﬁnd some
evidence of an anti-correlation between the two abundance
ratios in NGC 6441, with a Spearman rank correlation co-
eﬃcient of -0.7, corresponding to a probability of only ≈5%

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Our high resolution spectroscopy in the near IR gives radial
velocities well in agreement with previous studies, and typ-
ical (|vr| 6 ±100 km/s) of the bulge population. Also the
inferred velocity dispersions are fully consistent with previ-
ous estimates and typical of massive globular clusters. Our
iron abundances for NGC 6440 and NGC 6441 conﬁrm the
1/3 solar abundance derived from photometric estimates, as
obtained from the RGB morphology and luminosity in the
optical as well as in the near IR.

The enhancement of the [α/Fe] abundance ratio, rel-
ative to the solar value, agrees well with other studies of
clusters and bulge ﬁeld. This reinforces the statement of a
ab-origin enrichment of the interstellar medium by type SNII
and an overall star formation process and chemical enrich-
ment on a relatively short timescale.

metallicity.

O-Na and Mg-Al anti-correlations have been recently
discovered in several massive globular cluster stars (see
e.g. Sneden et al. 2004; Johnson et al. 2005; Gratton et al.
2007; Carretta 2006,
and references therein). Recently,
Gratton et al. (2006, 2007) also ﬁnd evidence of such
anti-correlations in NGC 6441. Such star-to-star abun-
dance variations of O, Na, Al and Mg are currently
interpreted as inhomogeneities in the proto-cluster gas,
due to the pollution of a former generation of mas-
sive AGB stars. Indeed, the H-burning at high temper-
atures, as occurring in thermally pulsing AGB undergo-
ing hot bottom burning (Ventura et al. 2001; Gratton et al.
2007), allows the O-N, Ne-Na and Mg-Al nucleosynthesis
cycles(Langer, Hoﬀmann & Sneden 1993), although the lat-
ter requires higher temperatures than the previous ones,
and produces less prominent abundance variations. Na-Al-
rich and O-Mg poor globular cluster stars are thus ex-
pected to have formed within the kinematically cool ejecta
of such a ﬁrst generation of massive AGB stars (e.g.
Cottrell & Da Costa 1981; Cohen, Briley & Stetson 2002).
