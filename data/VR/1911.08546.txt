Abstract  

    Kuiper Belt Object (385446) Manwë-Thorondor is a multi-object system with mutual 
events predicted to occur from 2014 to 2019. To detect the events, we observed the 
system at 4 epochs (UT 2016 Aug 25 and 26, 2017 Jul 22 and 25, 2017 Nov 9, and 2018 
Oct 6) in g, r, and VR bands using the 4-m SOAR and the 8.1-m Gemini South telescopes 
at Cerro Pachón, Chile and Lowell Observatory’s 4.3-m Discovery Channel Telescope at 
Happy Jack, Arizona. These dates overlap the uncertainty range (±0.5 d) for four inferior 
events (Thorondor eclipsing Manwë). We clearly observe variability for the unresolved 
system with a double-peaked period 11.88190 ± 0.00005 h and ~0.5 mag amplitude 
together with much longer-term variability. Using a multi-component model, we 
simultaneously fit our observations and earlier photometry measured separately for 
Manwë and Thorondor with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our fit suggests Manwë is bi-
lobed, close to the “barbell” shape expected for a strengthless body with density ~0.8 
g/cm3 in hydrostatic equilibrium. For Manwë, we thereby derive maximum width to 
length ratio ~0.30, surface area equivalent to a sphere of diameter 190 km, geometric 
albedo 0.06, mass 1.4x1018 kg, and spin axis oriented ~75 deg from Earth’s line of sight. 
Changes in Thorondor’s brightness by ~0.6 mag with ~300-d period may account for the 
system’s long-term variability. Mutual events with unexpectedly shallow depth and short 
duration may account for residuals to the fit. The system is complex, providing a 
challenging puzzle for future modeling efforts.

1. INTRODUCTION 

   The distant body (385446)	Manwë-Thorondor is one of ~50 known Kuiper Belt 
Objects (KBOs) in a 7:4 mean motion resonance with Neptune1. The orbits of bodies 
within and near this resonance evolve over long time scales, leading to a mixing of the 
cold and hot (i.e. low and high inclination) classical populations (Lykawka & Mukai 
2005, Volk & Malhotra 2011). Because these two populations are known to have distinct 
physical properties, with the cold population dominated by objects with very red optical 
colors (Peixhinho, Lacerda, & Jewitt 2008, Fornasier, Barucci, & de Bergh 2009, 
Peixhinho et al. 2015) and a large fraction of binary systems (Noll et al. 2008), assessing 
the physical properties of the KBOs within and near the 7:4 resonance constrains the 
extent to which the two populations have mixed. For example, Sheppard (2012) measured 
optical colors for 11 KBOs in the 7:4 resonance, including Manwë-Thorondor, and found 
all but one with very red optical colors similar to those observed for the cold population. 
However, other than their colors and orbits, little else is known about the physical 
composition of these resonant bodies. 

   Manwë-Thorondor is therefore of particular interest, not only because the mutual orbit 
of the bodies fixes the mass of the system, but also because at recent epochs Manwë and 
Thorondor have been alternately eclipsing and occulting each other. Using Hubble Space 
Telescope (HST) observations obtained from 2006 to 2013, Grundy et al. (2011, 2014) 
precisely determined the shape and orientation of the binary orbit and the system mass, 
msys (Table 1 lists the orbit parameters). From these results they predicted mutual events 
with duration ~12 h occurring four to five times per year from 2014 to the end of 2019, 
with the timing of these events uncertain by ~1/2 day. Among the KBOs, the only well-
separated eclipsing binaries previously observed have been Pluto-Charon (Buie, Tholen, 
& Horne 1992) and Sila-Nunam (Grundy et al. 2012, Verbiscer et al. 2013, Benecchi et al. 
2014, Rabinowitz et al. 2014). Measuring the time dependence and depth of these events 
presents a unique opportunity to accurately determine the size, density, and albedo of the 
components, and to detect local variations in their surface color or albedo as one body is 
gradually hidden and then exposed by the other. 

   In this paper we report photometric observations of the Manwë-Thorondor system, 
taken with the dual goals of constraining the rotational properties and capturing at least 
one of the predicted mutual events. The HST observations previously reported by Grundy 
et al. (2012) show that Manwë and Thorondor differ in brightness by ~1.2 mag on 
average, with this difference changing significantly over time because of independent 
variability of 0.5 and 0.7 mag for Manwë and Thorondor respectively. Owing to the 
sparse and scattered epochs of the HST observations, Grundy et al. (2014) were unable to 
determine a rotational period for either body. They conclude, however, that it is unlikely 
the two bodies are tidally locked in a shared rotation state.  From dynamical arguments 
they suggest Thorondor may be chaotically rotating or else spinning very rapidly. Given 
these considerations, we would expect our new photometric observations to reveal an

   Section 2 of this paper presents our observations and reduction procedures. In Section 3, 
we analyze the observations using two different methods. The first approach is to fit a 
sinusoidal function to the dominant periodic component of the light curve. Motivated by 
the limitations of this approach, we then use a more complex, multi-component model to 
predict and fit the observations, with the assumption that Manwë is a bi-lobed object with 
the barbell shape expected for a contact binary. We discuss the implications of both 
model fits in Section 4 and 5. 

2. OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION PROCEDURES 

  The observations we report group into four epochs. Each epoch includes at least one 
night targeting a predicted inferior event (Thorondor and/or its shadow moving in front of 
or over Manwë). Superior events were not targeted because of their coincidence with 
bright moon nights. When possible, observations were also made on a second (ideally 
consecutive) night when no mutual event was expected. With the SOAR and Gemini 
telescopes, observations were made alternating Sloan g and r filters in order to measure 
the dependence of color on rotational phase. Table 2 lists the observing circumstances for 
each epoch along with the expected mid-times and maximum depths of the targeted 
mutual event, and the target’s solar phase angle (q) and heliocentric and geocentric 
distances (rhel and rgeo). Given the large uncertainty in the predicted event times, there is a 
significant chance for the events to occur in daytime before or after the targeted evening.

    2.1 Epoch 1 – SOAR Telescope Observations 

    The epoch 1 observations reported here were obtained in the SDSS r and g bands on 
two consecutive nights (2016 Aug 25 and 26 UT) using the SOAR Optical Imager (SOI) 
on the 4-m SOAR telescope at Cerro Pachón, Chile. The imager consists of a mini-
mosaic with two thinned, back illuminated E2V 2kx4k charge-coupled devices (CCDs), 
together covering a 5.26 arcmin square field. We used the 2x2-binned readout mode, 
yielding a pixel scale of 0.154 arcsec. On both nights we took advantage of the remote-
observing capabilities of the SOAR telescope, controlling the camera and telescope from 
our home institutions in the USA. Operators and staff at the observatory provided 
instrument support and monitored the telescope, camera, and weather status throughout 
the night. 

    On both nights we observed Manwë-Thorondor at 8- to 10-min intervals over a period 
of 8 hours (02:00 to 10:00 h UT), with a nominal observing cadence of four r-band 
exposures followed by one in g band. Most exposures were fixed at 450 and 600 s for the 
r and g bands, respectively. Except for small dithers between exposures, we targeted the 
same field on both nights. This allowed us to use an identical set of field stars to calibrate 
all the photometry.  The two-night motion of Manwë-Thorondor was 1.5 arcmin, well 
within the field covered by the camera. We also oriented the camera so that the target did 
not move across the gap between the two CCDs in the array. Both nights were clear with 
seeing variable from 0.5 to 2.0 arcsec (median 1.2 arcsec).  

    Our second night was nearly optimally timed to cover the mutual event with an 
expected mid-time, tmid = 05:25 h UT Aug 26, and duration ~10 h. Here we define mutual 
event duration to be the interval of time when the expected brightness diminution would 
exceed 0.1 mag (see Grundy et al. 2014).  Given the 12-h uncertainty in the timing and 

4	

	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
our ~8 h observation windows, our likelihood of detecting at least half the event was 
~29% (5.3% and 24.1% on the nights of Aug 25 and 26, respectively). For detecting at 
least a 10% diminution, our expected likelihood was ~64% (13% and 51% on the 
respective nights).  

    2.2 Epoch 2 – Gemini South Telescope Observations 

    The epoch 2 observations were obtained in SDSS r- and g-bands on 2017 Jul 22 and 
Jul 25 UT using the GMOS-S imager on the 8.1-m Gemini South telescope at Cerro 
Pachón (the second night was delayed by 2 nights due to bad weather). The time was 
awarded under Gemini’s “Fast Turnaround Time” program. The imager is an array of 
three Hamumatsu 2048x4176 pixel CCDs with a field of 6144 x 4224 pixels covering 
8.35 x 5.63 arcmin. With 2x2 binning, the pixel scale is 0.16 arcsec. The queued 
observations were obtained by onsite operators on both nights, and sequenced 
continuously while conditions were acceptable (most of night 1, part of night 2). We 
monitored the operations remotely with a Skype connection. 

    Sequences consisted of five r-band exposures (240 s each) followed by two g-band 
exposures (150 s each), repeated throughout the night. All exposures were dithered, with 
the same pointing used for all exposures on both nights. The target was centered in the 
field on the first night, but appeared near a gap between two detectors on the second night. 
Because of the dithering on the 2nd night, the target sometimes fell into the gap between 
two of the detectors. Both nights were marginally clear with seeing variable from 1.0 to 
2.0 arcsec and with median values 1.2 arcsec (night 1) and 1.6 arcsec (night 2). 

    2.3 Epochs 3 and 4 – Lowell Observatory’s Discovery Channel Telescope 
Observations  

    The epoch 3 observations were obtained on 2017 Nov 9 UT in r band using the Large 
Monolithic Imager (LMI) on Lowell Observatory’s Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) 
at Happy Jack AZ. The LMI is a single 6144 x 6160 pixel E2V CCD with 0.24 arcsec 
pixel scale (3x3 binned) covering a field 12.3 x 12.3 arcmin. Observations had been 
planned for the latter halves of both 2017 Nov 8 and 9 UT. Because of bad weather, only 
sparse observations were obtained, and only on the second night. All exposures were 
600s. Seeing was 1 to 1.5 arcsec. 

    The epoch 4 observations were obtained 2018 Oct 6 UT in a wide VR band, again 
using the LMI on the DCT. Seeing was stable, between 1.2 and 1.5 arcsec. The target was 
too faint to observe using narrower-band filters.  

   2.4 SOAR and Gemini Reduction Procedures 

   To obtain the SOAR and Gemini light curves, we first used standard techniques to 
remove bias and flat field artifacts from the raw images, relying on bias exposures and 
twilight flats taken on both nights. For both the SOAR and Gemini data sets, each 
consisting of 2 nights of observations, we then used two different procedures to calibrate 

5	

	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the data. With procedure 1 we used IRAF programs to obtain a relative calibration of the 
target magnitudes, with careful attention to account not only for the relative extinction 
and seeing from one exposure to the next, but also for the influence of faint field stars 
near the path of the target. With procedure 2 we obtained absolutely calibrated 
magnitudes, including color corrections, making use of a photometry pipeline that 
measures and calibrates source magnitudes for fields that are within the footprint of the 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  This second procedure is described in Rabinowitz et 
al. 2014.  

We describe our implementation of procedure 1 in detail below. 

   Step 1: We determined the magnitude zero points for all the images on both nights 
relative to a chosen best image (least extinction, best seeing) by measuring the 
instrumental magnitudes for a fixed set of field stars common to all the images. We used 
a large aperture with diameter nearly double the worst seeing (2.5 arcsec for SOAR,  3.2 
arcsec for Gemini) for the field star photometry, and also a smaller aperture comparable 
to the median seeing (1.2 arcsec for SOAR,  1.3 arcsec for Gemini) to determine an 
aperture correction for the target photometry (see step 4). 

  Step 2: For each night we constructed a median reference image by selecting the best 
images (least extinction, best seeing, deepest exposures), sky-subtracting them, shifting 
their pixels to achieve a common alignment, scaling them to compensate for their relative 
zero points, and then computing the median average at each pixel location.  

  Step 3: For each image acquired on a given night, we removed the field stars by 
subtracting the alternate night’s median reference image after shifting each image to align 
with the reference, and scaling the reference to have the same zero point as the image. An 
alternate night’s reference image was chosen to make sure there was no residual signal in 
the reference image at the location of the moving target.  

  Step 4: Using the same small aperture used in Step 1 to measure the field stars, we 
measured the magnitudes for the target in the reference-subtracted images. We then used 
relative zero points and aperture corrections determined from the field stars (step 1) to 
normalize the photometry.  

  For the r-band, we used procedure 1 to obtain a precise measure of the light curve shape 
and then relied on procedure 2 only to have an independent check on these measurements 
and to establish the magnitude offset and color terms required to transform the 
photometry into the Sloan system. For the g-band, because we had only one night of good 
data (Gemini) or because we did not have enough observations to construct a good 
median sky image for both nights (SOAR), we relied exclusively on the second procedure 
for all photometry.  

  For both procedures 1 and 2 we used a small aperture comparable to the median seeing 
to measure the target flux. Note that the motion of the target in the SOAR r-band images 
(nearly all with 450-sec exposure times) was 0.34 arcsec, leading to a negligible 

6	

	
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
influence on the photometry (<1% loss in signal) given the much larger photometric 
aperture (1.5”).  The g-band exposures were longer (600 sec), leading to a possible small 
trailing loss of ~1.5%. There was insignificant trailing loss in the short Gemini exposures. 

   For both the r and g photometry, we determined color corrections iteratively in two 
passes under the assumption that the corrections were the same for all images in a given 
band. In the first pass we made an initial estimate of g-r without color corrections, 
knowing this would require a later correction. In the second pass we used our estimate for 
g-r to determine the color corrections individually for each measurement. Then for each 
band we evaluated the mean color correction and used this to correct all the measurement 
from both nights. Our final estimate for g-r is derived from these color-corrected values 
for g and r.  

   2.5 DCT  Reduction Procedures 

   The DCT observations were reduced using the standard procedures described by 
Thirouin & Sheppard (2019).  

  The r-band data collected on 2018 Nov 8 were taken through clouds in poor conditions. 
We include the few observations that could be calibrated to standards, but give them no 
weight in the foregoing analysis. 

  The VR-band data were calibrated to r-band standards. In the analysis below, we 
attempt to simultaneously fit the resulting r-band light curve along with our r-band 
photometry from previous epochs to a common model, ignoring any possible changes in 
color over time that might affect the relative calibration of the r and VR bands to the 
same magnitude system.   

3. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 

   3.1 Photometric Measurements 

  Table 3 lists all our magnitude measurements, M, along with Julian Date (JD) at the 
start of each exposure, the measurement error, the exposure time of the associated image, 
and the telescope. Light travel-time corrections relative to a common epoch (JD 
2454300.0) were computed for each observation date and used in the analysis described 
below. For the r-band, the listed measurement errors do not include the systematic 
uncertainty from the absolute zero point calibration and color correction. They do include 
the uncertainties in the instrumental magnitudes and their relative normalization 
determined from the statistical noise in the measured sky and target flux. The zero point 
uncertainties for both the g- and r-band magnitudes are ~2%, based on unsaturated stars 
in the field with SDSS magnitude uncertainties < 10%. Measurements contaminated by 
cosmic ray hits or taken in poor observing conditions (wind bounce, high airmass, poor 
focus, or insufficient exposure time are excluded from the tables and the analysis 
described below.

    3.2 Earlier HST Photometric Measurements 

    Table 4 lists resolved photometry of Manwë and Thorondor (magnitudes MM and MT, 
respectively) previously obtained with the HST Wide-Field Planetary Camera2 (WFPC2) 
in the F606W band at seven different epochs from 2007 to 2013 (earlier observations on 
2006 Jul 25 are excluded because no F606W-band data were obtained). Given the 
allocated orbits, only a few observations were obtained at each epoch, with each epoch 
spanning < 0.1 day.  Grundy et al (2014) report magnitudes for Manwë and Thorondor 

13	

	
 
 
 
derived from these data after transforming F606W to V band and averaging the results 
from each epoch. Here we present the measurements without transformation or averaging. 
For each epoch, we also list q and the apparent separation, D, between Manwë and 
Thorondor. The listed magnitude errors are the variance with respect to the epoch mean. 
For the 2008 Sep 7 epoch, there is only a single measurement. We estimate an error of 
0.1 mag consistent with the error for other epochs. An asterisk (*) indicates rejected 
measurements in the foregoing analysis (outliers, measurements with unusually large 
variance, or measurements made when Manwë and Thorondor were too close together to 
deconvolve reliably).   

   For each HST observation, we also list a pseudo magnitude for Manwë+Thorondor, M*, 
which is the F606W magnitude that would be observed for Manwë+Thorondor 
(unresolved) if the magnitude of Thorondor were fixed at its weighted mean value, <MT> 
= 24.4 mag, determined from all the unrejected HST observations. The reason for 
constructing this derived signal will be discussed further below.  Here we note that if 
Manwë’s light curve is regular and periodic on a time scale of ~1 day, while Thorondor’s 
brightness varies on a time scale comparable to the time between observing epochs 
(months to years), then a single rotational model will fit both the long-term variability of 
M* observed with HST in the years 2007 to 2013 and the more recently observed short-
term variability we observe for the unresolved system with the SOAR, Gemini, and DCT 
telescopes.

    3.3 Period Determination and Sinusoidal Light-curve Fitting 

    Here we determine the rotation period P by simultaneously fitting a periodic function, 
M(t), to all the photometry listed in Table 3 with the exception of the first DCT epoch 
(2017 Nov 8) which were collected in bad observing conditions, as noted above. We also 
fit the un-rejected combined HST photometry of Manwë+Thorondor listed in Table 4, 
M*. As discussed above, we construct M* assuming a brightness for Thorondor fixed at 
its mean HST brightness. Our assumption, here, is that the light curve of Manwë is 
regular and periodic over the entire time period spanned by the observations, while the 
variability of Thorondor is on a time scale much longer than any given observation epoch. 
The constructed HST photometry would therefore have the same periodicity and shape as 
the average light curve observed over a single epoch from the ground. 

    Following Rabinowitz et al (2014), we express M(t) as  

M(t) = Hj + bq(t) + F(t)  

(1) 

where Hj is the mean reduced magnitude in band j at phase angle q = 0 (i.e. the absolute 
magnitude in each band), t is the light-travel corrected observation time, b parametrizes a 
linear dependence on q. Function F(t) is a single harmonic sinusoid with harmonic 
amplitude A and phase f,  

F(t) = (A/2)sin(p [2f + 4w(P,t)]) 

(2) 

where w(P,t) is the rotational phase, w(P,t)  =  (t-to)/P, referred to an arbitrary epoch, to. 
There are two peaks per rotation, corresponding to the light curve of a rotating ellipsoid.  

    The first row of Table 5 lists the minimum c2, the number of degrees of freedom, N 
(239 observations less 7 fitted parameters), and the best-fit 	values and uncertainties for P, 
b, A, f, the absolute magnitudes Hg, Hr , and HF606W, and g-r. Here, we have assumed to= 
JD 2544300.0. Here we use the c2	minimization procedure described in detail by 
Rabinowitz et al. 2014. We also used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the 68% 
confidence intervals of the associated parameters. These simulations preserve the 
observation times and measurement errors, but use the best-fit light curve to model the 
magnitude values. These confidence intervals are valid  if the best-fit light curve is a 

15	

	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
good representation of the observed signal (i.e. c2 ~ 1). The second row of Table 5 refers 
to an improved fit after making additional adjustments to the data. We discuss the 
differences in the resulting parameters and the significance of the estimated errors further 
in Sec. 3.4. 

   Note that the resulting confidence intervals were determined after adding a systematic 
error of 0.025 mag in quadrature to the measurement errors listed in Tables 3 and 4. This 
accounts for measurement errors associated with the residual signal left by incompletely 
subtracted stars and galaxies along the target trajectory.  Adding this offset affects only 
the confidence limits we find for the fitted parameters, not their best-fit values.  The 
listed errors for Hg, Hr, and HF606W do not include the calibration zero-point uncertainties 
(~ 0.02 mag).

Figure 1. Reduced		c2	vs period P for the best-fit double-peaked light curve, simultaneously fit to the 
SOAR, Gemini, and DCT observations of Manwë-Thorondor and to earlier HST observations of Manwë 
after adjustment to include a contribution from Thorondor (see text for details) . Left side shows full range 
of reduced c2	over full range of the period search. Right side shows values near minimum reduced c2.	See 
Table 5 for best-fit parameters. 

     Figure 1 shows the minimum reduced c2 we find versus P, with the best fit occurring 
at P = 11.88190 h with reduced c2 = 3.02 (239 observations and 7 fitted parameters). 
Note that there are many other c2	minima near the best fit (see right side of Fig. 1). These 
are aliases with separation DP ~ 0.027 h, equivalent to one extra period in the long 
interval (438 days) between the two data sets most critical for fixing P (Gemini in 2017 
Jul and DCT in 2018 Oct). The most significant secondary minimum occurs at P = 11. 
96254 h with reduce c2 = 3.232. From Monte Carlo simulations, we find that these 
aliases yield a lower c2	than the true period less than 1% of the time. Hence, we reject 
this secondary minimum at the 99% confidence level.

alteration (see text for details). Blue, black, red, and magenta squares represent the F606W, r, g, and VR 
bands, respectively.  All observations have been adjusted to remove their fitted dependence on solar 
phase angle. The solid black line shows the best fit double-humped sinusoid (see Table 5 for model 
parameters). Each light curve has been shifted arbitrarily in the vertical direction for clarity, with the g 
band shifted relative to r by subtracting the fitted value for  g-r. The error bars show the statistical 
measurement uncertainty plus a systematic error of 0.025 mag added in quadrature.  The dashed lines 
show the nominally predicted diminution from Thorondor eclipsing and occulting Manwë  (see Table 2 
and Grundy et al. 2014) where the dependence on rotational phase is computed assuming the period and 
phase parameters listed in Table 5. Green color indicates the phase range where the diminution exceeds 
10%. Note that rotational modulation is not modelled in these event predictions, and the uncertainty in 
the timing of these mutual events is equivalent to a full rotational phase. The duration and depth of the 
events are also uncertain by a factor ~2 given the uncertainty in the diameters of the two bodies.

described above), followed by the SOAR, Gemini, and DCT nights. See the figure legend 
for symbol explanations. Note that the bottom light curve is a second representation of 
the 2nd DCT epoch (2018 Oct 6) showing the assumed effect of increasing the brightness

contribution from Thorondor (see discussion below). Also note that g band data (red 
squares) are shifted relative to r-band data (black squares) by subtracting the fitted value 
for g-r listed in Table 5. All error bars include an added systematic error of 0.025 mag to 
account for residual, un-subtracted background flux along the target path in the images. 
The dashed lines show the nominally expected diminution from predicted mutual events 
at the relevant epochs, high-lighted in green where the diminution exceeds 10% 
(discussed further below). 

    It is clear by inspection of Fig. 2 that our best-fit, single-harmonic sinusoid accounts 
for most of the signal variation we see from night to night (~0.5 mag peak to peak) with 
the exception of the second-epoch of DCT observations. We discuss the DCT 
observations further, below. Excluding these DCT data, the most significance deviations 
from the fit occur on the first Gemini night (2017 Jul 22) over the phase range w = 0.1 to 
0.3. There the sinusoidal fit comes to gradual maximum whereas the observed light curve 
flattens and then dips by ~0.2 mag (near w = 0.25) relative to the fit. These deviations 
occur in both the g and r band, and are not an artifact due to un-subtracted background 
sources in the field along the target trajectory. The second peak (near w = 0.7, covered 
only with the SOAR observations) does not appear to flatten significantly relative to the 
sinusoid. However, these data have larger scatter than the Gemini observations. There 
could be some flattening in the second peak that is unresolved. 

    With respect to the 2nd-epoch DCT data, the best-fit sinusoid phases well with the 
observations, but the DCT data have a larger peak-to-peak variation  (~0.7 mag, 
compared to 0.5 mag for the model) and a fainter average signal (by 0.15 mag). The DCT 
light curve also flattens significantly from w = 0.07 to 0.25 relative to the sinusoid.  This 
mirrors a similar flattening in the Gemini light curve that occurs over the same w range. 
On the assumption that the disparities in the DCT observations are the result of a 
diminished flux from Thorondor relative to earlier epochs (as might be expected from the 
~0.7 mag variability observed by HST), we computed the hypothetical light curve we 
would have measured if the flux from Thorondor were increased to its nominal value.  

    The resulting adjusted light curve appears at the bottom of Fig. 2. Here we assume that 
the actual r-band magnitude of Thorondor at the time of the DCT observations was 25.4 
mag (one magnitude fainter than average F606W magnitude observed by HST). We 
brighten Thorondor by one magnitude to compute the adjusted light curve. It is apparent 
that the adjusted light curve is now in significantly better agreement with the best-fit 
sinusoid. The average brightness and the peak-to-peak variation of the two curves are 
nearly matched. Refitting the observations with this adjustment improves the reduced c2	
from 3.02 to 2.39. Significant differences remain, however. Between w = 0.0 and 0.2, the 
adjusted light curve rises more steeply (2.9 mag/period) than the sinusoid (2.0 
mag/period). This phase range was not recorded at earlier epochs, so we cannot verify if 
this inconsistency was present at earlier epochs.  

    The second row of Table 5 lists the new values for the light-curve parameters that 
result from fitting the adjusted observations.  The changes are insignificant for P, A, 
HF606W, and g-r. Given the improved c2, this validates our uncertainty estimates for these 

19	

	
     
 
 
 
parameters. There is a small, but significant change in b (from 0.00 to 0.05 mag/deg), 
which is coupled to small decreases in Hg and Hr (by 0.04 mag). These differences are a 
likely indication of our fitting uncertainty, which are larger than we have calculated from 
Monte-Carlo estimates.   

   From the above comparisons we can conclude that the combined light curve for Manwë 
and Thorondor is periodic, with the peaks and valleys consistently occurring at the same 
rotational phase from the earliest HST observations (2007 Jul) to the latest ground-based 
observations (2018 Oct).  For most epochs the light curve is sinusoidal to 1st order.  The 
significant differences seen in the latest DCT data could be explained by Thorondor’s 
long-term variability. In section 3.6 we present a multi-component model to better model 
the over-all shape of the observed light curves. 

    3.5 Possible Mutual Event Detections and Non-detections 

    Below we examine the light curves measured at each observed epoch to determine if a 
mutual event occurred. As will become evident, it is likely we detected none of the 
predicted events, or that our detections were at most marginal. The reasons could be that 
the time span of our individual light curves did not sufficiently cover the uncertainty 
window of the event times. More interestingly, it could be that the nominal event 
predictions, while based on the most likely assumptions, were unrealistic because of 
unusual shapes or sizes for Manwë and Thorondor. 

    Epoch 1 (SOAR data). As shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 2, we would have detected 
a significant diminution in brightness of Manwë-Thorondor on the 2nd SOAR night if the 
maximum diminution (0.66 mag), the event duration (~12 hour or 1 full rotational phase), 
and the event mid time were as predicted. Even if the event mid time were early by 8 
hours or late by 10 hours, the expected diminution would exceed 0.1 mag at the 
beginning or end of the observational window, respectively. However, given the close 
similarity of our light curves from both SOAR nights, it is clear that such a significant 
diminution did not occur. Taking into account only the uncertainty in the timing of the 
event, our non-detection had a likelihood of ~40%. 

    Epoch 2 (Gemini data). Based on the above outcome, we planned our Gemini 
observations to detect a subsequent inferior event on the assumption that the actual mid-
time would be outside the ±1 sigma uncertainty window. Unfortunately, bad weather 
prevented us from scheduling our second night optimally. We therefore have no coverage 
in epoch 2 to verify a late event time. However, the first Gemini night would have 
overlapped the nominally predicted event (with the diminution exceeding 0.1 mag) if the 
event predictions were early by at least 10 hours.  

   Comparing the phased light curves from our two Gemini nights to each other and to the 
earlier SOAR nights, it again appears that no significant diminution occurred. As 
discussed in the previous section, there are some significant deviations on the first 
Gemini night relative to the best-fit sinusoid. Some of these deviations (e.g. the dip at w = 

20	

	
 
 
 
 
    
 
0.25, or else the deeper than expected minimum near w = 0.45) might result from a 
mutual event if both maximum diminution and duration were smaller than expected. We  
address these deviations again after presenting an improved rotational model for the 
system in Sec 3.6. The main conclusion is that the mutual event did not occur earlier than 
expected if the depth and duration were as nominally predicted. This leaves open the 
possibility the event was late. 

   Epoch 3 (DCT 2017 Nov 9).  The DCT observations scheduled 2017 Nov 9 would have 
detected a nominally predicted inferior event if it were early by 20 hours (2 sigma). 
Given the poor weather conditions and sparse observations, no conclusions can be drawn. 
The observations are marginally consistent with the best-fit sinusoid at the 1-sigma level. 

   Epoch 4 (DCT 2018 Oct 6).  The DCT observations scheduled on 2018 Oct 6 would 
have covered a nominally predicted inferior event if it occurred earlier than predicted by 
5 to 14 h. However, the expected depth for this event was small  (0.05 mags).  As 
discussed above, the light curve we observed on this night deviates significantly from the 
best-fit sinusoid, with deeper minimum and a lower average brightness. If the event depth 
were much larger than predicted, some of these variances might be the outcome of the 
mutual event. To be consistent with the negative detections at earlier epochs discussed 
above, this would imply that the model used to predict the mutual events is grossly in 
error, with the events predicted at earlier epochs not occurring at all, or occurring with 
much lower diminution than expected.  We return to this discussion later, after presenting 
an improved rotational model. 

   3.6 A Multi-component Model 

   To better fit both the short- and long-term variations in the combined light curve of 
Manwë and Thorondor, we construct a model to predict the variability for a multi-
component system.  Here we assume Manwë is a contact binary, rotating with period, PM, 
and composed of two equal-sized lobes with matching, uniform albedos. This system is 
orbited by Thorondor, an independent body rotating with period PT. The model 
determines the relative positions of the Sun, Earth, and all other bodies in the system and 
computes the total brightness variations caused by the mutual occultations and eclipses. 
In this paper, we assume a Lambertian scattering law for all surfaces. 

    As a starting point, we assume Manwë is a barbell-shaped contact binary composed of 
two equal-sized, elongated lobes connected by a narrow bridge (see Fig. 3). As shown by 
Gnat and Sari (2010) and again by Descamps (2015), this is the shape expected for a fluid 
body with normalized rotational velocity, W = [3p/rG]1/2/P ~ 0.30, where r is the density 
and G is the gravitational constant. As W approaches the critical value 0.2815, the narrow 
bridge connecting the two lobes vanishes and the hydrostatic solution becomes a pair of 
disconnected tidally-locked bodies.  Descamps uses shape models with W ranging from 
0.30 to 0.32  to fit the light curves of the suspected contact-binary (139775) 2001 QG298 
(Sheppard & Jewitt 2004), and the main-belt contact-binaries (624) Hektor and (216) 
Kleopatra. Based on this earlier work, we choose the shape model corresponding to W = 
0.31.  With the rotation period we measure for Manwë (P = 11.88 h), this requires r = 

21	

	
 
 
 
 
 
0.80 g/cm3. This density value is near the nominal value measured for KBOs of 
comparable size (Stansberry et al. 2008), near the value (0.75 g/cm3) estimated by 
Grundy et al. (2014) for the combined system bulk density, and within the range of 
values estimated for other likely contact binaries (Thirouin & Sheppard 2017, 2018). 
Hence, this shape model is a good starting point for modeling Manwë’s light curve.

Figure 3. Shape models for Manwë used for the multi-component light curve calculations presented in 
this paper.  The barbell model (grey-shaded figure, with long axis,  2a, and maximum perpendicular 
radius, b) is the shape calculated by Descamps (2015) for a strengthless body with normalized rotational 
velocity [3p/rG]1/2/P = 0.31. To simplify our  light curve calculations, we represent each lobe of this 
figure by a pair of contacting spheres (orange shading) with respective diameters dA = 2b and dB = a – 
2b. 

   For simplicity and to speed our computations, we approximate each lobe of the barbell 
shape calculated by Descamps by a pair of contacting spheres, A and B, with diameters 
dA and dB, aligned with the long axis of the barbell. To set their relative scale, we refer to 
the shape parameters a and b (the half the length of the barbell and its  maximum cross-
sectional radius, respectively) given by Table 1 of Descamps (2015). Scaled to the radius 
of a sphere with the same volume as the barbell, a = 2.284 and b = 0.694. We set dA to a 
value slightly less than the  maximum cross-sectional diameter (1.8 x b) and dB to span 
the gap between sphere A and the barbell’s midpoint (a – 1.8 x b) . This yields dB/dA = 
0.830. At maximum brightness viewed perpendicular to its spin axis, Manwë then has a 
surface area equivalent to a single sphere with diameter dM = dA[2(1+(dB/dA)2)]1/2 = 
1.838dA and a volume equivalent to a sphere of diameter dMVOL = dA[2(1+(dB/dA)3)]1/3 = 
1.465dA = 0.797dM. With this shape, we are able to produce a light curve differing by less 
than 10% from the one generated by Descamps (2015) for the case W = 0.32, assuming 
the same scattering law.  

    To model Thorondor’s contribution to the long-term variations of the light curve, we 
assume a spherical body with diameter, dT, and a brightness that oscillates sinusoidally 
with period PT (single-peaked) and amplitude AT mag. This variation could be due to 
albedo variations across the surface (e.g. a dark surface feature rotating into and out of 

22	

	
 
 
	
	
view). We further assume Thorondor’s brightest visible hemisphere has an average 
albedo matching Manwë’s albedo. This would be consistent with the matching colors 
observed for Manwë and Thorondor (Grundy et al. 2014) and for most KBO binaries 
(Benecchi et al. 2009). We recognize that Thorondor’s shape is likely elongated and the 
dominant contribution to Thorondor’s brightness variations. This is an important 
consideration because in mutual events with Manwë, Thorondor’s shape is a significant 
factor affecting the short-term time dependence of the light curve. We therefore do not 
expect our simplified multi-component model to accurately predict light curves during 
these particular events. At all other times, however, the shape we assume for Thorondor 
is less important. We assume a spherical shape only as a convenience to calculate 
Thorondor’s peak brightness relative to Manwë. We revisit this assumption later. As long 
as the resulting variability is slow, periodic, and approximately sinusoidal, our model 
predictions will be valid. To avoid the complication of modeling the mutual events, we 
assume that no significant mutual event occurred during the observations, consistent with 
the conclusion of the previous section.  

   Despite our  simplifying assumptions, the list of input parameters we need to 
completely specify our multi-component model are numerous (see Table 6) : diameters dT 
and dM, the heliocentric orbit of the tertiary system, the orbital elements for Thorondor’s 
motion about Manwë’s center of mass, Manwë’s rotation period, PM, and the orientation 
of Manwë’s equator (ascending node, W, and inclination, i, referenced to the J2000 
equatorial frame) and parameters  PT and AT characterizing Thorondor’s rotational light 
curve. We must also specify a reference epoch (eT) for Thorondor’s rotational phase 
(chosen to be the date of the most recent minimum) and the rotational angle (µ) of 
Manwë’s long axis relative to the ascending node of Manwë’s equator at a given epoch.  

    Fortunately, most of these parameters are known or well constrained. We refer to the 
JPL Horizons website2 for the heliocentric orbital elements. We refer to Grundy et al. 
(2014) for Thorondor’s orbit about Manwë, but we adjust the orbital period within its 
range of error (adding 0.020 d) so that no mutual events occur during any of the epochs 
covered by the observations. We fix PM at the value we initially determine by fitting a 
sinusoid to the observed light curves (see Table 5). We set eT = JD 2458398.0, coinciding 
with the second DCT epoch, when we expect Thorondor to be near minimum brightness. 
We can also set dT and dM by adopting the nominal respective values, 92 and 160 km, 
estimated by Grundy et al (2014). However, we scale these values up slightly by a factor 
1.16 so that dM = 188 km and dT = 108 km. We then have an average density for the 
system, r = msys/[(p/6)*([0.839dM]3 + dT
our shape model.  

3)] = 0.80 g/cm3, matching the density required by 

   There are nine free parameters that remain to be determined by fitting our multi-
component model to the observations: the rotational orientation of Manwë (W, i, and µ), 
the light-curve parameters for Thorondor (PT, AT), the absolute magnitudes of the 
combined system in the observed pass bands (Hg, Hr) and the separate absolute 
magnitudes for Manwë and Thorondor in the F606W band pass (HM and HT). We

reference each absolute magnitude to the fixed epoch, t1 = JD 2457625.0, chosen to be a 
time when Manwë and Thorondor are both near the peak of their separate light curves. 
We note here that W and i are coupled. All pairs of values that yield the same angle, aM, 
between Manwë’s rotational pole and the Manwë-Earth direction (or anti-direction) at a 
given epoch will yield the same predicted magnitudes. Because the Manwë-Earth 
direction changes only by ~10 deg during the total time spanned by the observations 
(including HST), aM is nearly constant. The geometry provides little leverage for 
decoupling W and i. 

   To obtain the fit, we use the same c2 minimization procedure described above (see Sec. 
3.3). Instead of using a sinusoid to described the model light curve, F(t), in Eq. (1), we 
substitute the light curve computed using our multi-component model. As before, we 
simultaneously fit all the observations listed in Tables 3 and 4, but we now separate the 
HST photometry for Manwë and Thorondor into two independent data sets. For each 
value of F(t), we therefore calculate offsets dFM(t) and dFT(t), which we add to F(t) to 
yield the predicted magnitudes for Manwë and Thorondor, respectively. We also 
normalize F(t) differently than before, defining F(t1) = 0 mag at epoch, t1.  In our earlier 
sinusoidal fit, we normalize the model light curve so that F(t) = 0 mag at its average value. 
This leads to a relative offset for the computed values of Hg, Hr, and HF606W. Also, because 
of this normalization, it is only the ratio of model parameters dT and dM that affects the c2 
values of our fits. If our shape model is correct, however, then we know the density of the 
system. The sizes are then constrained by the known total mass.   

   Table 6 lists the resulting best-fit values for the free parameters and for the fixed 
parameters discussed above. The reduced c2 of the fit is 2.0 for 255 observations with 9 
free parameters. The residuals to the fit are listed in the last column of Table 3. This is a 
significant reduction compared to our sinusoidal fit (c2 = 3.02). Figure 4 shows the best-
fit model light curve compared to the observations. Except for the top curve, these are the 
same observations we present in Fig. 2, again plotted versus rotational phase, w(P,t)  =(t – 
t0)/PM, with the value for t0 listed in Table 6. The top curve shows the residuals to the fit 
of the magnitudes for Manwë and Thorondor separately measured with HST.  Figure 5 
shows the residuals for all the measured magnitudes plotted versus q (averaged over bins 
of width Dq = 0.01 deg).

   Figure 4 shows that the new light-curve fit is in significantly better agreement with the 
observations than the sinusoidal fit shown by Fig. 2. The model now matches the 
maximum of the light curve between rotational phases 0.1 and 0.4 (Gemini 2017 Jul 22 
and DCT 2018 Oct 6) while simultaneously fitting the V-shaped minima appearing in the 
Gemini and DCT light curves. Taking into account the long-term rotational variability of 
Thorondor, the model is now able to match the relatively deeper minimum and overall 
decrease in brightness for the combined system observed by DCT on 2018 Oct 6. There  
are some observations of Thorondor near rotational phase ~1.0 that have large scatter, 
and mostly fall well below the model prediction (magenta points in top curve). However,  
all these outliers correspond to the epochs when Manwë and Thorondor are separated by 
less than 0.08 asec (JD 2454399 and 2444766), making the deconvolution of the separate 
fluxes of Manwë and Thorondor unreliable. Because these observations have large errors, 
they have negligible influence on the model fit.

Figure 4. Reduced magnitude versus rotational phase for Manwë-Thorondor. These are the same data 
represented in Figure 2 (see  legend), but now compared to a model light curve in which Manwë is a 
contact binary composed of two equal-sizes lobes, each constructed as a pair of spheres (see Fig 3), and 
Thorondor has a rotational light curve with a ~300-d period and 0.55-mag amplitude.  The rotation 
period for Manwë matches the best fit value listed in Table 5. The orientation of the Manwë’s spin axis 
and Thorondor’s rotation period are optimized to best fit the observations (see Table 6). The assumed 
orbital period for Thorondor has been adjusted (within its measured uncertainty range) so that all the 
mutual events occur outside the time ranges of each night’s observations. Manwë has a surface area 
equivalent to a sphere with diameter 186 km, and Thorondor has a diameter of 107 km. A Lambertian 
scattering model is assumed for all surfaces. Note that the top curve now shows the residuals to the 
model fit of the magnitudes for Manwë (blue) and Thorondor (magenta) separately measured with HST 
in the F606W band. A phased light curve is not shown for these data because the light curve amplitude 
and shape are variant over the long time span of the HST observations. Also note that the bottom light 
curve is a duplication of the un-adjusted, 2nd-epoch DCT data shown second to the bottom in Fig 2.  

    Note that we do not make an exhaustive search of parameter space to obtain this fit. We 
first sample the parameters on a coarse grid, and then search a finer grid only near the 
best best-fit value of the coarse search.  The particular orientation we obtain for Manwë’s 
equator (W=192, i=27 deg) corresponds to a pole orientation with aM ranging from 69.0 
to 78.9 deg over the time spanned by the observations in Tables 3 and 4. The pole’s angle 
with respect Thorondor’s orbital pole is 12.5 deg. However, as we discuss above there are 

26	

	
 
other pole orientations that have consistent values for aM and yield fits with only slightly 
higher c2. For example, we obtain c2 = 2.25 with W = 339 deg and i = 30 deg. The

after subtracting the best-fit multi-component model (see Fig. 4 and Table 6). See Fig. 4 for symbol 
explanations. 

corresponding pole has a very different angle with respect to Thorondor’s orbit (55.5 deg) 
while the aM range (77.6 to 78.9) is not significantly changed.  

     Regarding the best-fit value for PT, we find alternate solutions with PT =3.2359  and 
331.13 d that yield nearly the same c2 as the best fit at PT = 309.03 days. The shorter 
period is very close to an integer ratio (13/2) with Manwë’s rotation period (0.495079 d), 
while the longer period is nearly an integer multiple (3) of Thorondor’s orbital period 
(110.176 d). Both of these alternative values are likely aliases of the best-fit period 
generated by sampling bias. When fitting simulated observations that have the same 
observation dates and error bars as the real data but with magnitudes generated using our 
multi-component model (assuming PT = 309.03 days), we find these same aliases. In 
94/100 simulated trials, however, the true period yields the best fit. Assuming our model 
is a realistic description of the system, we have 94% confidence that our fit has identified 
the true period. If the actual light curve for Thorondor is not sinusoidal, other period 
solutions are possible.

4. DISCUSSION  

    4.1 Color Variation 

    Table 5 list the best fit color, g-r = Hg – Hr = 0.81 ± 0.03 mag we obtain for Manwë-
Thorondor assuming a sinusoidal fit. Our multi-components fit yields nearly the same 
value (0.82). This is consistent with the value, g-r = 0.85 ± 0.06 mag, reported by 
Sheppard (2012). From inspection of Figure 2 or 4, we can also conclude that there is no 
significant deviation between the g- and r-band light curves. At the level of our g-band 
measurement errors (5 to 10%), there is no dependence of color on rotational phase. 
Because Manwë’s rotational variability is the dominant contribution to the light curve 
variability on short time scales, we can conclude that Manwë’s hemispherically-averaged 
color is uniform with rotational longitude, although there might be a dependence on 
latitude. To the extent that color is a tracer of albedo (as it is on Pluto; Olkin et al 2017), 
this also indicates a uniform hemispherically-averaged albedo. 

    4.2 Solar Phase Angle Dependence 

    We derive an unusually flat slope to the solar phase curve for both Manwë and 
Thorondor from our sinusoidal fit (b = 0.0 ± 0.01 mag/deg) and we obtain the same value 
with our multi-component fit. This flat slope is demonstrated by Figure 5, which shows 
that the residual magnitude to the multi-component fit has no significant dependence on q. 
While similarly flat phase curves for q in the range 0.1 to 1.0 deg have been observed for 
icy satellites, the dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt, and for the Haumea family members, 
most of the smaller and redder objects in the Kuiper Belt (with sizes and color similar to 
Manwë and Thorondor) have steeper phase curves (Rabinowitz et al. 2008, Verbiscer et 
al. 2019). The relatively flat phase curves for both Manwë and Thorondor require 
surfaces for both bodies with composition and/or scattering properties different from the 
general population (e.g. much higher albedo and larger ice fraction). Albedos much 
higher than we estimate from our multi-component model (see Table 6) would require 
smaller sizes and higher densities than we have estimated for both bodies, inconsistent 
with the shape model we have assumed. At very small phase angles (q < 0.1  deg, near 
the lower q range of our observations), the icy satellites exhibit strong opposition surges  
(Verbiscer, French, & McGhee 2004, Buratti, Bauer, & Hicks 2011). Our observations do 
not extend to sufficiently low phase angle to rule out this possibility for Manwë or 
Thorondor.  

    We note here that our analysis has not allowed for independent values of b for Manwë 
and Thorondor. It is possible that Thorondor has a steeper solar phase curve than the 
value we derive for Manwë and Thorondor together. The phase curve is sensitive to the 
rotational light curve we assume for Thorondor which is not well constrained by the 
observations (see further discussion below).

    4.3 The Shape, Mass, Density, Size, and Albedo of Manwë 

    We have shown that Manwë-Thorondor has a clear periodic component with a fixed 
period over the entire span of the observations. To 1st order (~10% precision) and over a 
time span of a few days, the variability is sinusoidal.  However, we obtain a better fit at 
all epochs (including fits to the separate Manwë and Thorondor photometry from HST) 
with a multi-component model where Manwë is a barbell-shaped, strengthless contact 
binary rotating at the dominant period (with two peaks per rotation) while Thorondor 
varies sinusoidally with a single-peaked period of ~309 days and amplitude ~0.55 mag.  
It is remarkable that we obtain this fit by tuning only 6 parameters (Thorondor’s 
rotational period and amplitude, Manwë’s spin orientation, and the rotational phases of 
Manwë and Thorondor). We must also make a small adjustment to the orbital period of 
Thorondor so that no eclipses occur, but no fine tuning is required for that purpose. It 
follows that our shape model is at least consistent with the observations.  

   If the shape model we have used is correct and Manwë is a strengthless body in 
hydrostatic equilibrium, then Manwë’s density (r ~ 0.8 g/cm3 ) is uniquely determined by 
its rotation period (PM ~11.88 h). The equivalent spherical diameters for Manwë’s volume 
and area (dMVOL = 150 km and dM = 188  km) and its mass (mM =1.41x1018 kg) follow 
directly from the known system mass (msys=1.941x1018kg) as long we have a good 
estimate for Thorondor’s relative mass, mT/mM. As we discuss below, our model fit to the 
photometry suggests mT/mM = 0.38 (or less if Thorondor’s shape is aspherical). It then 
follows that our estimates for dMVOL and dM are accurate to ~15% precision. Given the 
absolute magnitude we measure at maximum brightness in the F606W band, HM = 6.94, 
and assuming Manwë’s V-band magnitude is fainter than the F606W-band magnitude by 
DV, F606W = 0.383 mag (derived using synphot and Manwë’s F606W-F814W color, see 
Benecchi et al. 2009), we can then derive an albedo for Manwë, pM = 0.06. This is within 
the nominal range of albedos known for KBOs the size of Manwë (Brown and Butler 
2017, Stansberry et al. 2008).  

    4.4 The Size, Shape, Albedo, and Relative Mass of Thorondor 

   Regarding the shape and rotation of Thorondor, we have no good constraints except 
that the brightness variability must be at least as large as we have measured (> ~0.55 
mag) and the time scale of the variability must be ~300 days if it is periodic.  However, 
we do not have enough observations to verify periodicity.  Our model fit does require that 
the surface-area equivalent spherical diameters of Manwë and Thorondor at maximum 
brightness have a ratio close to the values we assume, dT/dM = 108/188 = 0.57 (assuming 
matching albedos). If Thorondor is spherical and has the same density as Manwë, then we 
derive the relative mass, mT/mM = [dT/dMVOL]3 = 0.38. Here we use the relation dMVOL/dM = 
0.797, which derives from the shape model we have assumed for Manwë. This estimate 
for mT/mM is an upper limit if Thorondor’s shape is non-spherical because a sphere has 
the smallest surface area to volume ratio of any shape.  

    From Sec 4.3, our assumption that Manwë is strengthless and in hydrostatic 
equilibrium allows us to determine dM with better than 15% certainty.  We can then 

29	

	
 
 
 
  
 
accept our estimate for Thorondor’s diameter, dT = 108 km, as similarly accurate for a 
sphere with an albedo at maximum brightness matching Manwë’s albedo. However, from 
the absolute magnitude we measure for Thorondor (HT = 7.73 mag), and assuming the 
same F606W- to V-band transformation we use for Manwë (DV, F606W = 0.383 mag), we 
derive a maximum-brightness albedo pT = 0.09, significantly larger than the 
corresponding albedo we derive for Manwë (pM = 0.06)  This violates an implicit 
assumption of our model. It is not possible for both our model and our observations to be 
correct in this case. 

   The likely source of this conflict is our assumption that Thorondor’s light curve is 
strictly periodic and sinusoidal over the entire time spanned by the observations. If we 
drop this assumption, we can artificially construct a light curve for Thorondor that yields 
a lower value for pT. For example, if we alter our model to predict a brightness for 
Thorondor that is ~50% higher during the time period spanned by the HST observations 
(2007-2013) compared to later observations (2016-2018), then HT increases by 0.44 mag 
and pT matches the value we derive for Manwë.  

   This brightness change would occur naturally if Thorondor is lenticular shaped (similar 
to the “Ultima” lobe of 2014 MU69; Stern et al 2019), rotating about its shortest axis (i.e. 
the lowest-energy rotation state) and Thorondor’s rotation pole is closely aligned with its 
orbital pole.  The orbital pole’s angle, aT, with respect to Earth’s line of site varies from 
81.6 to 86.3 deg during the HST epochs, and from 90.1 to 91.4 deg during the later 
observed epochs. To calculate the resulting change in brightness, assume Thorondor is a 
triaxial ellipsoid with semi-major axes, a > b > c. With a/c = 7.33, and b/c = 6.67, we 
have a flattened shape similar to the Ultima lobe, but with roughly half the relative 
thickness. Then from Eq. (4) of Connelly and Ostro (1984), Thorondor’s projected area, 
A, viewed from Earth is: 

A= pab[(sin aT sin w /[a/c])2 + (cos aT cos w /[b/c]) 2 + (cos aT) 2]1/2, 

where w is the rotational phase. This yields a mean visible surface area ~40% higher 
during the HST epochs than the later observed epochs, nearly matching the long-term 
variability we require for Thorondor.   

  Although a lenticular shape would explain the long term changes in Thorondor’s 
brightness, it would not explain the ~300-day variability we observe with amplitude 
~0.55 mag. However, such variability might arise from the precession of the orbital pole 
for this shape.  From Eq. (12) of Dobrovolskis (1995), the instantaneous rotational 
acceleration, d2w/dt2, for a triaxial ellipsoid on an eccentric orbit about a spherical 
primary at periapsis is: 

d2w/dt2 = -K(1-e)6 – 6pgT-2(1-e)3sin(2n) 

where T is the satellite’s orbital period, g = (a2-b2)/(a2+b2), n is the angle between the long 
axis and the direction to the primary, and K ~1.6x10-11 yr-2 for an icy body the size of 
Thorondor (scaled from the value estimated by Dobrovolskis  for Nereid). The extrema 

30	

	
   
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
for d2w/dt2 occurs when n is an odd multiple of p/4. With T = 110.176  d (see Table 1) 
and  g = 0.095 for the lenticular shape we have assumed for Thorondor, the extrema 
equate to ±0.0056 d-2. Given Thorondor’s slow rotation, this torque would be enough to 
alter Thorondor’s rotational velocity by as much as 25% in one orbit. If Thorondor’s 
rotational pole is tilted ~12.5 deg from its orbital pole (see discussion above), then the 
maximum torque would precess the rotational pole by ~70 deg about the orbital pole. 
Although the likely outcome over many orbits would be chaotic changes in Thorondor’s 
rotation period and pole orientation, similar to the chaotic rotation initially suggested for 
Pluto’s smaller moons (Showalter & Hamilton 2015), the resulting oscillations in aT 
might yield the ~300-day periodicity we observe for Thorondor at recent epochs. 

    4.5 Mutual Events 

   Our multi-component model does a good job of fitting the observed light curves on the 
assumption that no mutual events occurred during the observation windows. This is a 
plausible assumption given the large uncertainty in the event mid-times. However, we 
have explored alternative model fits for which significant mutual events do occur and 
significantly alter the model light curves. With fine tuning of the orbital parameters of 
Thorondor at values outside their ranges of uncertainty, it is possible to produce mutual 
event light curves that fit the observations approximately. If these solutions are correct, 
they would require significant secular changes to Thorondor’s orbit over the time 
spanned by the observations. Additional HST imaging would likely be required to verify 
these orbital changes.  

  There is the additional possibility that mutual events occur during the observation 
windows, but the resulting alteration of the light curves is marginal. For example, if 
Thorondor were to eclipse or occult the narrow connecting bridge between the lobes of 
Manwë, this would significantly reduce the expected depth and duration of the event. 
This scenario might be possible with an appropriate choice for the direction of Manwë’s 
pole (while keeping the same angle with Earth’s direction). If Thorondor has a lenticular 
shape that we view edge on during the mutual events (see discussion, above), then this 
would further shorten the events and reduce their depths. It is conceivable that such an 
event is the cause of the dip observed in the light curve with Gemini on 2017 Jul 22 at w 
= 0.25 (see discussion in Sec 3.5). We plan to explore such scenarios in a subsequent 
paper. 

   Regarding the detectability of future mutual events, there is a possibility that the event 
season is either longer or shorter than nominally predicted. Grundy et al. (2014) assumed 
a spherical shape for Manwë. However, if the barbell shape we obtain for Manwë is 
correct, then the orientation of Manwë’s rotational pole is a significant factor affecting 
both the duration of the events and the range of dates when the relative position of the 
Earth and Sun allow eclipses and occultations. Relative to the nominal diameter for the 
eclipse predictions (160 km) assumed by Grundy et al., Manwë may be  larger by a factor 
of 2 in one orientation, but smaller by a factor of 2 in the perpendicular direction. The 
shape and orientation of Thorondor also affect the predictions. For favorable orientations, 
the event season may be a year or two longer than previously predicted.

5. CONCLUSIONS 

   We present multi-epoch light curves of the Manwë-Thorondor eclipsing system that 
show complex variability. Although we collected this data with the hope that we would 
observe a significant mutual event, we do not see clear evidence of such events at any of 
the epochs covered by our observations. Instead, we find a system with a light curve that 
is clearly periodic from day to day, but changes shape, depth and amplitude over the 
course of a year.  The simplest explanation for not detecting the mutual events is that they 
did not occur when we were looking. Given their timing uncertainty, this explanation has 
a significant likelihood. This missed opportunity, however, has a silver lining.  The 
absence of the mutual events allows us to construct a relatively simple, multi-component 
model to fit the light curve we observe. The success of our model fit suggests that Manwë 
may be a tidally distorted bi-lobed body with the barbell shape expected for a strengthless 
body in hydrostatic equilibrium. From the constraints of the shape model and from the 
system mass and photometric constraints, we determine Manwë’s size, albedo, and 
density. The resulting values for these properties are  typical of other KBOs and contact 
binaries of comparable size.  

   We do not have tight constraints on Thorondor’s shape or size, but we can conclude 
that at recent epochs Thorondor was ~33% as bright as Manwë (at peak for both bodies), 
but had a significantly larger or brighter visible surface area during the time period 
covered by the earlier HST observations. This could be explained by an unusually 
flattened shape for Thorondor, viewed nearly edge on during the later epochs when Earth 
passes through Thorondor’s orbit plane and the mutual events are expected.  If confirmed, 
this shape and rotational orientation provide a valuable constraint in future efforts to 
determine the dynamical process that created the multi-body system. 

  In a subsequent paper, we hope to better explore the uncertainties of our shape model. 
There are likely a range of models that would work as well or better to fit the 
observations. Based on the range of values for the physical properties determined by 
these models, we could then determine their uncertainty ranges.  If models are found that 
yield much higher albedos for Manwë and Thorondor, these would be more consistent 
with the unusually flat solar phase curve we determine for both bodies.  

   Choosing the best shape model, we would be best prepared to explore the possibility 
that the small deviations we observe in the residual signal are associated with marginally-
occurring mutual events or an unusual shape for Thorondor. The Manwë-Thorondor 
system is complex, but promises to be a rich system for further exploration. Future 
ground- and resolved space-based observations would provide tighter constraints on the 
separate rotation states of Manwë and Thorondor, and may reveal properties of the 
system overlooked by our preliminary model.
