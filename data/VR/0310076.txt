Abstract. We have measured the expansion velocities and proper mo-
tion of the ansae in NGC 7009 using high dispersion echelle spectra and
archive narrow band HST images. Assuming that the ansae are moving
at equal and opposite velocities from the central star we obtain an aver-
age system radial velocity of −54 ± 2 km/s, the eastern ansa approaching
and the western ansa receding at vr = 5.5 ± 1 km/s relative to this value.
Only the proper motion of the eastern ansa could be measured, leading to
2.8± 0.8 arcsec/century, or vt = (130± 40)d km/s, where d is the distance
to the nebula in kpc. Additionally, the electron temperature and density
for each ansa was measured using line intensity ratios. The results are
Te ∼ 9000 K and ne ∼ 2000 cm−3 for both ansae within the errors.

Introduction

NGC 7009 is a good example of a planetary nebula with FLIERs1 The nebula
shows two pairs of condensations along the major symmetry axis. The outer
pair has been called ansae (=handles, Aller 1941). The condensations show
strong emission in low ionization lines and weak emission in high excitation ones.
Kinematic studies by Reay & Atherton (1985) and Balick, Preston & Icke (1987)
have shown that the ansae are moving very near the plane of the sky at velocities
∼ 102 km/s with respect to the central star. Here we aim to better determine
the kinematics of the ansae in NGC 7009, measuring radial velocities from high
dispersion echelle spectra and proper motions from archive HST images. As
a by-product, the electron temperatures and densities are measured from line
intensity ratios.

2. Observations and Data Reduction

The data consist of a set of echelle spectra and two sets of public HST images
taken in 1996 and 2001. The spectra were obtained during the night of July 29,
2002, with the CTIO 4m echelle spectrograph, which was optimized to cover the
spectral range 410 nm - 720 nm. The dimensions of the slit were 1.2′′ × 6.6′′, and
the mean seeing was 1.4′′. For wavelength calibration a Th-Ar lamp was used.
The ﬂux calibration was done with observations of the star 58 Aql (HR 7596).

The HST images were obtained from the HST archive. The ﬁrst set was
taken on April 28, 1996 using the WFPC2 with a [NII] 6583 narrow band ﬁlter
(Balick et al. 1998). The second set was taken in May 11, 2001 also with the
WFPC2 and the same ﬁlter (Palen et al. 2002).

The echelle spectra were reduced and calibrated using standard IRAF rou-
tines. The dispersion is 0.008 nm pixel−1, or 3.7 km.s−1.pixel−1 at 650 nm. The
HST images were retrieved from the archive using the On The Fly Calibration
option. The calibrated images of each set were median combined to eliminate
cosmic rays.

3. Results

3.1. Radial Velocities

The lines that could be identiﬁed in the spectra are listed in Table 1. The
central wavelength of each line was measured by ﬁtting a Voigt proﬁle. Almost
every line could be identiﬁed in two echelle orders, thus the value quoted is the
average of the two values in each order. The rest wavelengths of forbidden lines
were taken from Bowen (1960), while the values for the permitted lines were
taken from Moore (1945). Assuming symmetric expansion with respect to the
central star, the system velocity is the average of the ansae’s velocities, namely
−54±2 km.s−1, whereas the radial expansion velocity with respect to the central
star is vr = ±5.5 km/s.

3.2. Proper Motions
The HST images have a shift between 1996 and 2001 of 20′′ in the east-west direc-
tion, which makes the western ansa disappear from the 2001 images. Therefore,
only the proper motion of the eastern ansa could be measured. The position of
the ansa was determined by conﬁning it in a box of width 5′′ and calculating a

centroid. Three stars were selected as reference points for angular displacement
measurements, namely the central star and two background stars. The results
for the angular displacements are listed in Table 2. A fourth reference point was
determined by looking for a point that minimized the square of the distances
between the three reference stars, weighted by the error in each position. The
angular displacement relative to this point is listed as Least squares. An av-
erage between the displacements with respect to each star is also listed. The
proper motion is obtained by dividing the corresponding angular displacement
by the time diﬀerence between both set of images, nl. 5.038170123 yrs. All
displacements occur in the same direction, outward from the central star. Using
the least squares value for the proper motion, one gets a tangential velocity of
vt = (130 ± 32)d km/s, where d is the distance to the nebula in kpc. Comput-
ing a weighted average of 14 values from the literature (Acker et al. 1992) gave
0.86kpc or vt = (112 ± 32) km/s

3.3. Line intensities, Electron Temperatures and Densities

The line intensities of the [NII] and [SII] lines were measured in order to derive
the electron temperature and density in both ansae. Voigt proﬁles were ﬁtted to
each line using the IRAF task splot. The interstellar extinction correction was
made assuming a recombination model B with T = 104 K and ne = 104 cm−3,
and an extinction coeﬃcient cβ = 0.26 (Lame & Pogge 1996). The line intensity
ratios together with electron temperatures and densities derived from them are
listed in Table 3. The latter results were obtained using the formulae from
McCall (1984). The errors in the ratios were calculated from the S/N in each
line.

4. Comparison with previous results

The results for the radial velocities are in good agreement with previous de-
terminations.
If we take only the results for the [OI] 6300 line, we get a re-
sult equal within the errors to that of Reay & Atherton (1984), who measured
vr = ±6.2 km.s−1 with respect to the central star using a Fabry-Perot interfer-
ometer. The only available measurement of proper motion is that of Liller (1965),
who obtained 1.6 ′′/century using photographic plates, which is almost a factor

equal within the errors to those reported by Balick et al. (1994) and Bohigas et
al. (1994), while the electron density is within a factor of two from the results of
the same authors.
