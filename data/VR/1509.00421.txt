Abstract—The  Global  Asymptotic  Stability  (GAS),  Voltage 
Regulation (VR), and Power Regulation (PR) of the excitation and 
governor  control  system  are  of  critical  importance  for  power 
system security. However, simultaneously fulfilling GAS, VR, and 
PR has not yet been achieved. In order to solve this problem, in 
this paper,  we  propose a  Lyapunov-based  decentralized  Control 
(LBC)  for  the  excitation  and  governor  system  of  multi-machine 
power system. A completely controllable linear system is actively 
constructed  to  design  the  time-derivative  of  the  Lyapunov 
function  and  GAS  is  guaranteed  by  satisfying  the  condition  of 
GAS  in  Lyapunov  theorem.  At  the  same  time,  VR  and  PR  are 
performed by introducing both voltage and power to the feedback. 
The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested and validated 
on a six-machine power system.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

E

XCITATION control and governor control of generating units 
are  important  measures  for  improving  transient  stability 
and achieving Voltage Regulation (VR) and Power Regulation 
(PR) [1]-[16]. For excitation control design, enhancing system 
stability and maintaining VR are two main goals [3]. In [7], the 

 
 
 
 
 
Global  Asymptotic  Stability  (GAS)  and  the  VR  have  been 
simultaneously  addressed  by  nonlinear  control  design  of  the 
excitation  system.  However,  simultaneously  achieving  GAS, 
VR, and PR for both excitation control and governor control is 
still an open question.  

Governor control and excitation control are often considered 
as two independent controls [8]-[10]. In order to independently 
discuss  excitation  control  and  governor  control,  assumptions 
that neglect the mutual influence of the excitation system and 
governor system must be introduced, which results in lack of 
the  proof  on  GAS.  In  [8],  a  Differential  Geometric  Control 
(DGC) method is proposed only for the steam valve governor 
system to enhance transient stability, where the transient EMF 
in  q-axis  must  be  assumed  constant.  In  [9]  and  [10], 
decentralized  excitation  control  and  steam  valve  control  are 
discussed by Direct Feedback Linearization (DFL) to improve 
system  stability  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  mechanical 
power and the transient EMF in q-axis are constant.  Besides, 
neither VR nor PR can be achieved due to a lack of voltage or 
power feedback [8]-[10].  

By contrast, by considering the mutual interaction between 
the  excitation  and  governor  loops,  better  transient  stability 
margins can be provided [11]. Taking into account the mutual 
interaction, DGC is applied to design excitation and governor 
control [12]-[14]. In [12], a DGC-based decentralized control is 
proposed for the excitation and governor system of hydraulic 
generating  units.  The  GAS  can  be  achieved  because  there  is 
only  one  equilibrium  point  for  the  equivalent  linear  system. 
However,  since  voltage  and  power  are  not  considered  as 
feedback,  VR  and  PR  cannot  be  performed.  In  [13],  another 
DGC-based  method 
large  reheat-type 
turbo-generators.  But  GAS  cannot  be  achieved  because  the 
model  of  large  turbo-generators  with  High-Pressure  (HP), 
Intermediate-Pressure  (IP),  and  Low-Pressure  (LP)  cylinders 
and  re-heater  dynamics  is  too  complicated  to  be  completely 
linearized by DGC. In [14], although the DGC-based method 
achieves GAS and VR for condensing-type turbo-generators, it 
does not consider PR.  

is  developed  for 

Although GAS, VR, and PR are all very important for power 
system security, there is no existing research that can achieve 
all  of  them  at  the  same  time.  In  this  paper,  we  aim  at 
fulfilling  GAS,  VR,  and  PR  by  a 
simultaneously 
Lyapunov-based control (LBC) for the decentralized excitation 
and  governor  control  system.  Our  contributions  can  be 
summarized as follows: 

1)  The  GAS  of  a  system  is  guaranteed  by  satisfying  the 
condition of GAS in Lyapunov theorem based on the design 
of the eigenvalues of a symmetric real matrix; 
2) Voltage and power deviations are introduced to determine 
the negative definiteness of the time-derivative of Lyapunov 
function  based  on  a  completely  controllable  linear  system 
that is actively constructed by including voltage and power 
deviations to perform VR and PR through the control inputs; 
3)  The  proposed  LBC  method  can  simultaneously  achieve 
VR, PR, and GAS for different types of generators, such as 

2

the  hydraulic  generators,  the  condensing-type  generators, 
and the reheat-type generators.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, 
power system models for different types of generating units are 
introduced.  In  Section  III,  the  feedback  on  the  decentralized 
excitation  and  governor  control  is  addressed.  In  Section  IV, 
Lyapunov-based decentralized excitation and governor control 
is  proposed  for  multi-machine  power  systems.  Simulation 
results on a six-machine power system are presented in Section 
V to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. 
Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section VI. 

II.  MODELS OF EXCITATION AND GOVERNOR SYSTEMS 

Generator control systems include the excitation system and 
governor  system.  Here,  we  introduce  different  types  of 
excitation system and governor system. 

A.  Excitation System 

Extensive studies have been conducted for the designing of 
decentralized  excitation  controllers  to  enhance  power  system 
stability  [1]-[7],  [17].  In  these  studies,  the  excitation  control 
system is usually described by the classical third-order model, 
for  which  the  mathematical  expressions  and  symbols  can  be 
found in many references, such as [1]-[7]. 

B.  Governor Control System 

The  Hydraulic  Turbine  Governor  (HTG)  system  and  the 
Steam  Turbine  Governor  (STG)  system  are  introduced  as 
follows. 

(1) HTG control system 

The  HTG  control  system  is  used  to  drive  hydro-generator 
units. It exhibits high-order nonlinear behavior and can be very 
complex. Without considering the elasticity effect of the water 
column, the hydraulic turbine of HTG can be described as [12]:

(2) STG control system 

The  STG  control  system  is  used  to  drive  turbo-generator 
units.  It  usually  includes  Condensing-type  Governor  (CG) 
control  system  [8]  and  Reheat-type  Governor  (RG)  control 
system  [16].  The  CG  system  drives  small  turbo-generators, 
while the RG system is for large turbo-generators.

The  HTG  control  system  consists  of  the  control  and 
actuating  equipment  used  to  regulate  the  power  output  of 
hydro-  generators  by  controlling  water  flow.  The  key  to 
controlling  the  water  flow  is  to  regulate  water-gate  opening 
according  to  a  regulation  signal.  Therefore,  both  the  power 
output  and  the  water  gate  opening  are  considered  as  the 
feedback of nonlinear control as:

III.  FEEDBACK STATEMENT ON EXCITATION AND GOVERNOR 
CONTROL SYSTEMS 

In the control design of the excitation and governor systems, 
the feedback information is of great importance for achieving 
control goals. The feedbacks of voltage and power can be used 
to performing VR and PR [3], while the rotor speed feedback 
can  improve  the  transient  stability  of  power  systems  [2]. 
Besides,  some  feedback  information,  such  as  the  water  gate 
opening, should also be included in order to implement PR by 
regulating  the  output  of  active  power.  In  the  following,  we 
discuss the feedback information for the excitation system and 
different types of governor system. 

A.  Feedback Information of Excitation Control System 

The  excitation  system  is  the  only  way  to  regulate  the 
generator voltage and its primary objective is to maintain the 
voltage level at the generator bus. Thus voltage should be used 
as feedback. Besides, in real power systems the rotor speed is 
always used as the feedback input of power system stabilizer 

For the reheat-type governor control system, PR is controlled 
by  HP,  IP,  and  LP  cylinders.  From  (5),  (6),  and  (11),  the 
objective of the steam valve opening of the HP cylinder can be 
developed. Similarly, we can deduce the objective of the steam 
valve opening of the IP cylinder from (8) and (11). Accordingly, 
we use the following feedback:

IV.  DECENTRALIZED VOLTAGE AND POWER REGULATION 
CONTROL WITH GAS 

Here, GAS, VR, and PR are achieved for the excitation and 

governor control systems based on Lyapunov theorem.  

A.  Lyapunov Function  

Based  on  the  above  discussion  about  the  three  types  of 
1n  
governor control systems, we consider a power system with 
2n condensing-type  turbo-generators,  and 
hydro-generators, 
3n  reheat-type turbo-generators. By introducing the feedback 
in (12)-(15), a Lyapunov function is constructed as:

Remark  1:  Equation  (23)  is  designed  to  regulate  the 
differential trajectory  yΔ  through the control inputs. We  can 
actively construct such a system, because control can be viewed 
a special force presented by the designers to achieve the goals 
of the control design. According  to  linear control theory,  the 
system  illustrated  in  (23)  can  be  a  completely  controllable 
linear system by the constants 1
, jia , 
Remark 2: With complete controllability, the poles of (23) can 
be  arranged  arbitrarily  through  virtual  inputs,  by  applying

linear  control  method,  which  means  that  the  trajectory  of 
time-derivative  yΔ  can  be  controlled  by  virtual  inputs  based 
on pole arrangements. Therefore, we can use (23) to regulate 
the negative definiteness of (17). 
Remark 3: It is noted that (23) is constructed with the feedback 
information such as voltage and power deviations and thus we 
introduce both voltage and power deviations to determine the 
negative definition of the time-derivative of Lyapunov function. 
Therefore, GAS is closely related to VR and PR, and GAS, PR, 
and VR are considered simultaneously.  

For (23), the feedback can be solved as

D.  Statement on Performing GAS, VR, and PR 

in 

the 

feedback 

form  of 

The  Lyapunov  function  in  (16)  is  constructed  by  using  a 
quadratic 
(12)-(15).  The 
time-derivative of the Lyapunov function is also designed as a 
quadratic  form  of  the  above  feedback  through  control  inputs 
based on the design of a differential trajectory. Therefore, GAS 
is closely related to the tracking errors of the system variables 
such as terminal voltage and active power. While achieving the 
stability  of  a  system,  the  tracking  deviations  of  voltage  and 
active  power  are  also  decreasing.  When  the  system  finally 
stabilizes  in  a  steady  state  due  to  the  feedback  control,  the 
tracking errors of voltage and power will be also eliminated. In 
such a manner, GAS, VR, and PR are achieved simultaneously. 

V.  SIMULATION RESULTS 

Here, we present results to validate the effectiveness of the 
proposed  control  approach.  All  simulations  are  performed  in 
Matlab. 

A.  System Description 

To demonstrate a nonlinear control design, a power system 
with 3 generators is often used, as  in  [2],  [9], [10], and  [17]. 
However, in order to cover more types of generators, here we 
consider a six-machine power system illustrated in Fig. 1, for 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which Generator 1 represents the infinite bus, Generator 6 is a 
synchronous  condenser,  Generators  2  and  5  are 
large 
reheat-type generators, Generator 3  is  a  hydro-generator,  and 
Generator 4 is a small condensing-type generator. More details 
about the parameters of this system can be found in [8].

B.  Parameter Calculation 

For  generators  2-5,  the  models  in  (23)  have  a  total  of 

eighteen orders. By using the parameters in Table I, we have

When one considers the feedback gains in Table II, all of the 
eigenvalues of the matrix Ψ  in Section IV.C are negative real 
number  and  thus  Ψ  is  negative  definite.  Consequently,  the 
matrix Φ is  also  negative  definite.  Therefore,  GAS  can  be 
guaranteed because the condition in (28) and (29) is satisfied.  
As in Table II, we use the same gains for all of the generators. 
System  performance  may  be  improved  by  choosing  different 
feedback gains for different generators, which, however, is out 
of the scope of this paper.

C.  Simulation Analysis 

In  order  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed 
Lyapunov-based  Control  (LBC),  we  compare  it  with  the 
DGC-based methods [12]-[14]. Note that LBC can be used for 
all types of generators while each DGC-based method can only 
be  used  for  one  specific  type  of  generator.  The  DGC-based 
method  in  [13]  for  large  reheat-type  generators  is  called 
DGC-R for convenience. The DGC-based method in [12] for 
hydro-generators is called DGC-H. The DGC-based method in 
[14]  for  small  condensing-type  generators  is  called  DGC-C. 
Therefore,  generators  2-5  are  assigned  DGC-R,  DGC-H, 
DGC-C, and DGC-R, respectively.  

Although  DGC-R,  DGC-H,  and  DGC-C  are  all  proposed 
based on DGC, their control designs are significantly different. 
In Table III, we show whether or not each of them can achieve 
VR,  PR,  or  GAS.  As  discussed  in  Section  IV,  the  LBC, 
however, can simultaneously achieve VR, PR, and GAS for all 
types of generators.

(1) Performing VR 
At 0.25 s, there is a step change of voltage references from 
the initial condition to the regulation target, as shown in Table 
IV. By LBC and DGC-R, the expected voltage can be achieved, 
as  illustrated  in  Fig.  2(a).  From  Fig.  2(b),  power  outputs  of 
generators can also be maintained at initial values by LBC and 
DGC-R.

Although  the  power  output  of  generator  3  almost  keeps 
constant  by  DGC-H,  as  in  Fig.  2  (b),  its  terminal  voltage 
deviates  from  the  initial  value  due  to  the  lack  of  voltage 
feedback and the change of power flow, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). 
From Fig. 2, by DGC-C, the terminal voltage of generator 4 can 
be regulated to the expected value, but the active power output 
deviates from the initial value due to a lack of power feedback. 

(2) Performing PR 
At 0.25 s, there is a step change of power references, as in 

Table V. The dynamic response is shown in Fig. 3.  

By  LBC  and  DGC-R,  PR  can  also  be  achieved  while 
maintaining  the  initial  voltage.  By  DGC-H,  PR  cannot  be 
performed, and terminal voltage also deviates from the initial 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
value, because of it does not have voltage or power feedback. 
For DGC-C, although the terminal voltage can be kept at initial 
value, the expected output of active power cannot be achieved 
because of a lack of power feedback, as shown in Fig. 3(b). 

feedback  in  DGC-H,  the  terminal  voltages  of  the  other 
generators  can  be  maintained  by  using  LBC  and  DGC-based 
methods.

At  0.5  s,  a  three-phase  short  circuit  fault  is  applied  at  the 
beginning of line 11-12 in Fig. 1, and the line is removed after 
0.15  second.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4(a),  except  for  the  voltage

As  in  Fig.  4(b),  LBC  is  much  more  effective  than  the 
DGC-based methods in damping system oscillations caused by 
the three-phase short circuit fault. 

In  order  to  further  explore  the  benefits  of  the  proposed 
controller  in  enhancing  system  stability,  Critical  Clear  Time 
(CCT) is calculated by trial and error by considering different 
line faults and is listed in Table VI. When a three-phase short 
circuit fault occurs at line 11-12, the CCT of LBC is the same as 
that of the DGC-based methods. However, for the other faults, 
the LBC is much more superior to the DGC-based methods in 
improving  system  stability.  This  is  because  DGC-R  cannot 
achieve  GAS.  With  DGC-R,  the  system  stability  can  be 
enhanced in some cases when appropriate feedback gains are 
used, but this does not hold for the other cases because GAS 
cannot be theoretically guaranteed.

power  system  is  achieved  by  the  proposed  Lyapunov-based 
controller, and at the same time, voltage and power regulation 
are performed by introducing both voltage and power into the 
nonlinear feedback. Simulation results on a six-machine power 
system  demonstrate  and  validate  the  effectiveness  of  the 
proposed control method.

VI.  CONCLUSION 

VR, PR, and GAS are important for power system security 
and thus need to be considered in the excitation and governor 
control design. The GAS of a power system can be achieved by 
using some advanced control methods (such as DGC) [12], if 
VR  and  PR  are  not  considered.  However,  to  the  best  of  our 
knowledge, simultaneously fulfilling GAS, VR and PR in the 
excitation and governor control design has not been achieved.  
In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  decentralized  excitation  and 
governor  controller  to  tackle  this  challenge.  The  GAS  of  the
