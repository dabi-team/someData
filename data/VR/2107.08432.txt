INTRODUCTION  

In  virtual  reality  (VR)  games,  playability  and  immersion 
are  two  primary  factors  because  they  affect  gameplay, 
enjoyment, and performance. However, these two factors can 
be  adversely  affected  by  VR  sickness  (VRS)  symptoms. 
Despite  recent  advances  in  VR,  VRS  remains  a  significant 
challenge to overcome, especially in games, because it is often 
in-game 
difficult 
performance, gameplay, and experience[1].

to 

One technique that has been shown to mitigate some VRS 
symptoms  is  Teleport  [2].  Teleport  is  a  well-established 
technique that effectively allows users to skip discretely whole 
sections of the virtual environment and has presented excellent 
results in reducing nausea and oculomotor symptoms. On the 
other  hand,  its  trade-offs  often  involve  performance  loss, 
which  can  be  acceptable  in  some  contexts  but  might  not  be 
desirable  in  games.  This  issue  led  us  to  our  first  research 
question:  (RQ1)  What  are  the  trade-offs  in  immersion,  VRS, 
and  player  performance  when  using  Teleport  in  games, 
especially fast-paced ones like first-person shooters (FPS)? 

Recently researchers have  proposed other  techniques that 
can help reduce VRS. These techniques manipulate what users 
perceive in the head-mounted display (HMD) and how they see 
elements in the 3D virtual environment [1], [3]. Unavoidably, 
they also have their trade-offs. For example, some techniques 
use field-of-view (FoV) reduction to mitigate VRS ([4], [5]). 
More recently, others have attempted to provide a copy of the 
3D  view  and  display  it  as  a  2D  view  or  2D  frame  (2DF  for 
short) [6]. That is, it reduces the amount of visual detail that 
users see. This technique has been shown to produce the same 
level  of  immersive  experience  in  a  VR  FPS  game  but  with 
reduced  levels  of  VRS  and  without  affecting  players' 
performance and gameplay in the fast-paced game.  

Teleport  has  not  yet  been  compared  to  these  newer 
techniques,  like  2DF.  The  positive  results  of  2DF  led  us  to 
explore our next two research questions: (RQ2) Is Teleport a 
more effective VRS mitigation technique than a technique like 
2DF, which reduces aspects of the environment but still allows 
continuous  movement?  (RQ3)  Can  gamers  using  Teleport 
perform better than using a technique like 2DF?  

This research aims to answer these three questions to help 
understand what types of techniques are more useful in a fast-
paced  environment,  like  an  FPS  game,  in  VR.  To  study  the 
effects of 2DF as an alternative to Teleport in FPS games, we 
replicated the technique used in [6] and used it in a similar VR 
environment. Our results show that Teleport  offered a  worse 
trade-off than 2DF in player performance and provided similar 
levels of VRS. Our results suggest that a technique like 2DF 
could be a valuable alternative to Teleport in FPS games and 
other similar VR applications. 

The  main  contributions  of  this  paper  are:  (1)  a  deeper 
understanding of one of the most popular techniques (Teleport 
[2]) in games; (2) the replication and validation of a new VRS 
mitigation  technique  that  reduces  visual  detail  [6];  and  (3)  a 
comparison  of  their  effect  on  player  performance  and 
gameplay.  

II.  BACKGROUND 
VRS is very common and has been studied for quite some 
time [7]. Despite this, its origins and sources are still not fully 

 
 
 
 
understood. Two theories that have broad support are the Rest 
Frame  Hypothesis  [8],  [9],  and  the  Sensory  Conflict  Theory 
[10]. The Rest Frame Hypothesis posits that the human brain 
assumes that some stationary environmental objects can serve 
as reference points to view the world. Accordingly, using fixed 
gazing points or other visual objects [11], [12] can help reduce 
VRS.  The  Sensory  Conflict  Theory  assumes  a  mismatch 
between different sensory systems, which can cause sickness. 
For example, when there is visual movement (vection) but no 
vestibular  stimulation  (that 
the 
environment moving but one is not physically moving), people 
can  feel  disoriented.  One  of  the  factors  associated  with  its 
severity is the movement performed in the virtual world [13], 
[14].  Therefore,  applications  that  require  movement  and 
generate vection seem to increase users' likelihood of feeling 
sick. As such, these theories support the use of one of the most 
well-known techniques for locomotion in VR (Teleport  [2]), 
which does not require movement and is embedded in many 
commercial applications (e.g., Superhot VR [15]). 

things  and 

is,  seeing 

Other  types  of  techniques  that  do  not  require  reduced 
locomotion  have  also  been  proposed  to  reduce  VR  sickness 
[11],  [16],  [17].  Some  involve  altering  some  other  visual 
aspects of the virtual environment and have been investigated 
to determine their relative performance and advantages [18]–
[20]. These techniques can be grouped into two: (1) visual and 
(2)  locomotion.  Visual  techniques  do  not  explicitly  alter 
movement,  other  physics  properties,  and  environmental 
mechanics.  Examples 
the  viewing 
perspective or adding a gazing point. Locomotion techniques, 
on  the  other  hand,  alter  in  some  way  the  physics  to  distort 
movement.  Examples 
include  Teleport  and  geometry 
deformation [21].  

involve  changing 

A. 

Visual Techniques 

Visual techniques used to mitigate VRS vary widely in how 
they change the presentation of the VE. Some add information 
to the environment, such as Gaze Point [12], which gives users 
a central fixed rest frame. This technique is based on the Rest 
Frame Theory, which predicts that people get VRS because it 
is harder to find a stationary reference frame to rely on when 
navigating in VR. This technique takes different forms, such as 
a grid pattern [22], clouds in the sky [23], and minions [12].  

Other  visual  techniques  specific  to  HMDs  are  viewpoint 
snapping  [24]  and  rotation  blurring  [25].  Both  reduce  the 
players' amount of virtual movement while keeping the physics 
laws  aligned  with  the  real  world.  To  an  extent,  they  are  the 
equivalent  of  closing  one's  eyes  while  virtual  movement  is 
performed. Because no real movement happens and the virtual 
movement is not seen, there is no conflict between the senses. 
In their studies, they reduced the mean VRS by around 40%. 

Many visual  mitigation  techniques are based on reducing 
users'  field  of  view  (FoV).  FoV  reduction  has  been  widely 
studied and has led to positive results [4], [26]–[28]. It has been 
tested in simple tunnels [29] and can be inserted inside games. 
Also,  it  can  sometimes  be  used  in  dynamic  ways  by,  for 
example,  proportionally  changing  the  areas  reduced  with 
increased  movement  [27].  Yet,  some  people  cannot  adapt  to 
FoV  reduction  [26],  which  can  help  reduce  VRS  by  around 
30%. 

Figure 1:  Upper  part) The  concept used in  the  2D  View technique as  seen 
from the game editor; a 2D picture of the 3D environment is presented in front 
of the user's view. The 2D view is of configurable size. Lower part) The game 
implementation of the concept of the 2D view as seen from the player's eyes.  

A recent paper [6] introduced a technique that combines the 
features of various visual techniques, including Gaze Point and 
FoV  reduction.  It  provides  a  "picture"  of  the  3D  virtual 
environment displayed as a 2D view (see Fig. 1) and has been 
shown advantages over a simple gaze point. Its positive results 
were  due  to  the  use  of  a  2D  frame  to  view  the  3D  virtual 
environment.  In  some  instances,  the  mean  VRS  reduction 
could be as high as 50% [6]. 

B. 

Locomotion Techniques 

Geometry deformation [21] is a recent location technique. 
It changes the objects' mesh when the users walk towards them 
to reduce the virtual space that the users perceive as movement 
in the VR environment. However, because it is relatively new, 
it is unclear how well it would be accepted in a gaming context. 

Teleport  is  arguably  the  most  well-known  locomotion 
technique.  Teleport  moves  the  player  immediately  from  one 
place to another in a discrete way (see Fig. 2). It often uses a 
cut scene and removes the movement through the virtual world. 
Because no movement is present or seen by users, the level of 
sensory  conflict  is  minimal,  and  hence  the  level  of  VRS  is 
reduced.  Some  studies  show 
that  Teleport  can  be 
disadvantageous  for  performing  VR  tasks  because  it  can  be 
disorienting  [30]  and,  as  such,  it  may  not  be  an  appropriate 
choice  for  games.  On  the  other  hand,  other  researchers  have 
not  found  any  issues  with  disorientation  and  suggested  that 
Teleport is more enjoyable in games when compared to other 

 
 
 
forms  of  locomotion  [31].  Even  though  Teleport  presented 
mixed results in user experience  [30], [31], and some people 
even find it more sickening [32], [33], the mean reduction in 
VRS when using Teleport is around 50% [32], [34], which is 
similar to the best results of the 2DF [6]. 

Figure 2:  A  screenshot  of  the  standard  Teleport  technique  used  in  the 
introduction of a commercial HMD. 

The above findings led us to the following three research 
questions: (RQ1) What are the trade-offs in immersion, VRS, 
and player performance when using Teleport in a fast-paced 
game? (RQ2) Is Teleport a more effective mitigation technique 
than 2DF? (RQ3) Can Teleport led to better performance than 
a 2DF like technique?   

III.  EXPERIMENT DESIGN 

We  conducted  an  experiment  to  evaluate  how  Teleport 
would  behave  in  a  first-person  shooter  (FPS)  game  and 
compared it to the 2D view reduction technique [6] in terms of 
VRS,  user  performance,  and  immersion.  We  chose  the  2DF 
technique  to  compare  against  Teleport  because  it  has 
performed better than other similar techniques [6].  

We implemented the 2DF technique in Unity, as described 
in  [6]. Teleport's implementation was based on the  "Point & 
Teleport with Direction Specification" approach [35]. We used 
the  same  configurations  of  the  standard  SteamVR  Teleport, 
transition style, and speed. 

A. 

Game Environment 

The  game  for  our  experiment  was  developed  in-house  to 
avoid or minimize  confounding factors. It was a typical  FPS 
game in which players were required to navigate rapidly and 
destroy the enemies but avoid being hit by them to finish the 
game. It consisted of a maze for players to traverse through. 
There  were  hallways, chambers, and pillars that can be  used 
strategically within the maze. The adversaries were ellipsoids 
that shoot "energy balls" at the player. They would all attack 
upon locating the player's avatar.  

The maze was composed of tall grey walls and, to reduce 
path  memorization,  it  did  not  have  other  visual  cues.  Turns 
were designed to force the player to rotate during the game to 
increase  the  possibility  of  VRS  [36]–[39].  Moreover,  the 
pillars and chambers for hiding were meant to encourage the 
players  to  perform  actions  and  balance  shooting  and  hiding. 
There were no ambiguous paths or shortcuts. Consequently, all 
the players would follow roughly the same path. 

Figure 3:  Our  teleport  method;  a  player  can  see  the  destination  position 
(lower orange circle), and orientation (upper green circle). The enemies and 
walls follow the specifications given in [6] (i.e., monochromatic ellipsoids and 
grey walls).  

In  the  first  turns,  we  placed  each  kind  of  ellipsoid 
individually to give the players the chance to get familiar with 
their behavior and environment. After, the pace was increased 
by expanding the number of enemies up to the final hall, where 
most enemies were found (10).

Evaluation Metrics 

The  Simulator  Sickness  Questionnaire  (SSQ)  [40]  and 
Immersive Experience Questionnaire (IEQ) [41] were used in 
the experiment. SSQ covers three parts to measure the level of 
Nausea,  Disorientation,  and  Oculomotor.  The  overall 
weighted level for VRS (Total Severity) was calculated as the 
sum of these three parts. Each symptom uses a 5-point Likert 
Scale  from  least  severe  to  most  severe.  IEQ  is  also 
implemented this way. 

The  following  scoring  system  was  used  in  the  game:  the 
player would get 10 points for hitting a target and lose 10 points 
if hit by an enemy. The score can be negative. Based on this 
system, Accuracy was defined as the number of shots that hit 
the target divided by the total shots.  

We expected the players to be aware  that the  adversaries 
could  kill  them.  However,  as  the  experiment's  goal  was  to 
investigate several facets of the gameplay experience, we set 
the players' health points (HP) to be able to endure at least 4 
minutes  of  getting  hit  directly  to  guarantee  the  collection  of 
enough meaningful data. 

We  also  introduced  an  additional  measurement:  Jumps. 
Jumps  counts 
the  player's 
the  number  of  changes  in 
translational position after hitting a target, i.e., the number of 
different positions a player has when hitting different targets 
(see  Fig.  4).  We  treated  different  positions  between  two 
adjacent shots as one Jump. We expected this measurement to 
inform us of the players' movement behavior, reflecting how 
careful and focused participants were during the game. Also, it 
can be an influential factor in terms of comparing continuous 
and discrete movements. We used the Jumps measurement to 
explore  correlations  with  the  other  evaluated  scales.  Jumps 
were recorded in each experiment individually.

Experimental Procedure 

When  participants  reached  the  experimental  room  (an 
indoor  lab  on  campus),  they  were  asked  to  fill  in  a  pre-
experiment  questionnaire  to  collect  demographics  and  past 
gaming experience information. We assigned a specific order 
of these three versions for participants to follow using a Latin 
Square design to mitigate the accumulative sickness as much 
as possible. To let participants  become  familiar with the VR 
HMD and the Oculus Touch, we demonstrated the Oculus Rift 
using  an  official  game  demo  without  walking.  We  also 
introduced  the  rules  of  the  game  and  the  corresponding 
operations of the different versions. 

Participants  followed  the  defined  order  to  play  the  three 
versions.  After  completing  each  version,  they  were  asked  to 
answer the questionnaires mentioned above and rest as much 
as they wanted before continuing the next version.

Results 

We used both statistical inference methods and visuals to 
analyze the  data. A Shapiro-Wilk test  was conducted first to 
check for the normality of the data. We used parametric tests 
for  normally  distributed  data;  for  the  others,  we  used  non-
parametric tests. We conducted Mauchly's Test of Sphericity 
for  normally  distributed  data  and  employed  Repeated 
Measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction 
to  detect  overall  significant  differences.  We  applied  the 
Greenhouse-Geisser correction when faced with a violation of 
the  assumption  of  sphericity.  For  non-normal  data,  we 
conducted  the  Friedman  test.  If  there  was  a  significant 
difference,  we  then  ran  Wilcoxon  signed-rank  tests  with 
Benjamini-Hochberg  correction 
the 
difference occurred among different combinations. Finally, we 
used  Pearson's  correlation  for  normally  distributed  data  and 
Spearman's  correlation  for  non-normal  ones  to  identify 
correlations.

1)  Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) 

The results of the SSQ data are summarized in Fig. 5. The 
data  were  distributed  normally  in  the  four  sub-scales.  After 
conducting  the  Friedman  Test,  we  found  a  statistically 
significant difference in all four sub-scales:  χ2(2) = 8.391, p 
= .015 for Nausea, χ2(2) = 6.578, p =.037 for Oculomotor, χ2(2) 
= 11.577, p = .003 for Dizziness, and χ2(2) = 6.491, p = .039 
for Total Severity (or simply Total). 

Post-hoc  test  showed  no  significant  difference  among 
versions  in  Nausea  (Z  =  -1.848,  p  =  .065  for  3DVR  and 
Teleport  and  Z  =  -.205,  p  =  .838  for  Teleport  and  2DVR) 
except  2DVR  and  3DVR,  for  which  Z  =  -2.672,  p  =  .008. 
Median  (IQR)  Nausea  levels  were  3,  2,  and  5  for  2DVR, 
Teleport, and 3DVR, respectively.

Player P is in its first registered position when Enemy 1 is hit; B) State in which 
one Jump is counted because, when the bullet hits Enemy 2, Player P's position 
is different  from its original position in A); C) State in which no Jumps are 
counted because, when the bullet hits Enemy 2, Player P's position is the same 
its original position in A). 

IV.  EXPERIMENT 

Our experiment was designed to compare how Teleport and 
2DF fare against each other and no VRS mitigation technique, 
which was our baseline technique. For Teleport, along with the 
instantaneous  shift  in  position  to  the  pointed  area,  the  user's 
landing  orientation  after  teleportation  could  be  changed  by 
adjusting the direction of the arrow in the expected position of 
the teleportation (see Fig. 3). We chose to use 2DF surrounded 
by a dark background because it was reported to be the most 
effective  [6].  Hence,  we  evaluated  the  three  conditions:  3D 
view and VR HMD with Teleport (Teleport), 2D frame in a VR 
HMD (2DVR), and 3D view and VR HMD without Teleport 
(3DVR). 

In  addition,  as  stated  earlier,  to  compare  these  versions 
from  a  VRS,  user  performance,  and  subjective  immersion 
perspective,  we  used  Jumps.  Since  it  is  possibly  a  new 
measurement  tool,  we  analyzed  correlations  between  Jumps 
and the other measurements.  

A. 

Participants 

We recruited a total of 18 participants (9 females) from a 
local  university  with  an  average  age  of  20.0  (s.d.  =  1.90), 
ranging from 18 to 27. All volunteers had normal or corrected-
to-normal vision. None of them declared any history of color 
blindness  or health  issues.  Thirteen  participants  (72.2%)  had 
experience with VR systems. Three (16.7%) reported that they 
felt sick when playing regular FPS games on a PC.  

B. 

Apparatus 

We used an Oculus Rift CV1 as our HMD because it is one 
of the most popular off-the-shelf VR devices. A desktop with 
16GB  RAM,  an  Intel  Core  i7-7700k  CPU  @  4.20GHz,  a 
GeForce GTX 1080Ti dedicated GPU, and a standard 21.5" 4K 
monitor were used to drive the HMD. Also, we used a pair of 
Oculus Touch as our controller.  

 
 
 
Figure 5:  Mean  results of  SSQ  concerning  the  four  sub-scales  of  the three 
techniques. Bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 

Next,  we  observed  that  in  Oculomotor,  there  was  a 
significant difference between 3DVR and Teleport (Z = -2.129, 
p = .033) and between 3DVR and 2DVR (Z = -2.183, p = .029) 
after correction. However, the difference between Teleport and 
2DVR was not significant (Z = -.144, p = .885). Median (IQR) 
Oculomotor levels for 2DVR, Teleport, and 3DVR were 1, 0, 
and 2, respectively. 

In  terms  of  Disorientation,  after  we  applied  the  same 
correction, they all had a significant difference with each other. 
In detail, Z = -2.186, p = .029 for 3DVR and Teleport, Z =  -
3.051, p = .002 for 3DVR and 2DVR, and Z = -2.214, p = .027 
for  Teleport  and  2DVR.  Their  Median  were  2DVR  =  2.5, 
Teleport = 1, and 3DVR = 0.5, respectively. 

Finally, there was no significant difference among different 
comparisons  in  Total:  3DVR  and  Teleport  (Z  =  -1.122,  p 
= .262), 3DVR and 2DVR (Z = -1.156, p = .248) and Teleport 
and 3DVR (Z = -1.226, p = .220). The Median IQR were 2DVR 
= 6, Teleport = 4, and 3DVR = 6.5. 

2)  User Performance 

Fig. 6 shows the data for Score, Accuracy, Time, and Jumps 
of the three versions. For the score, Friedman Tests showed an 
overall  significant  difference  among  these  versions  (χ2(2)  = 
19.972, p =.000). Similarly, Jumps also differed significantly 
(χ2(2)  =  19.681,  p  =.000).  Similarly,  RM-ANOVA  tests 
revealed that Time differed statistically significantly (F (2, 34) 
=  4.260,  p  =  .022,  ηp2  =  .200).  However,  a  significant 
difference was not found for Accuracy ((F (2, 34) = 1.299, p 
= .286, ηp2 = .071). 

In  our  post-hoc  analysis,  Wilcoxon  signed-rank  tests 
showed  that  Score  in  all  versions  differed  significantly  with 
each other: 3DVR and Teleport (Z = -3.528, p = .000), 3DVR 
and 2DVR (Z = -2.369, p = .018), and Teleport and 2DVR (Z 
=  -3.158,  p  =  .002).  74.5,  7.5,  60.5  were  the  Median  (IQR) 
Score levels for 2DVR, Teleport and 3DVR, respectively. 

Our  post-hoc  analysis  also  revealed  that  for  Jumps  there 
was a significant difference between 2DVR and Teleport (Z = 
-3.681, p = .000), and between Teleport and 3DVR (Z = -3.485, 
p  =  .000).  However,  no  significant  difference  was  found 
between  3DVR  and  2DVR  (Z  =  -1.308,  p  =  .191).  Their 
Median were 3DVR = 74.5, Teleport = 23 and 2DVR = 66.5.  

In  terms  of  Time,  there  was  no  significant  difference 
between 3DVR and Teleport (p = .129),  between 3DVR and 
2DVR (p = 1.000), and between Teleport and 2DVR (p = .066).

techniques. Bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 

3)  Perceived Immersion 

RM-ANOVA  tests  showed  a  significant  difference  in 
overall immersion (F (2, 34) = 5.520, p = .008,  ηp2 = .245). 
Post-hoc  analysis  showed  that  immersion  in  3DVR  was 
significantly higher than in 2DVR (p = .017). However, there 
was no significant difference between 3DVR and Teleport (p 
= .187) or Teleport and 2DVR (p = .604). Fig. 7 shows the data 
for immersion among three versions.

Bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 

4)  Correlations between Jumps and other sub-scales 
Table  1  shows  a  summary  of  the  correlations  between 
Jumps  and  other  sub-scales  for  the  different versions.  It  was 
clear that in all three versions, there were strong and positive 
correlations between Jumps and Score, which were statistically 
significant: rs (8) = .824, p = .000 in 3DVR, r = .866, p = .000 
in Teleport, and rs (8) = .847, p = .000 in 2DVR.  It also showed 
that Jumps is not strongly and positively correlated with Time 
except in 2DVR (rs (8) = .621, p = .006). For Immersion, there 
was  a  strong  and  positive  correlation  in  3DVR  and  2DVR, 
where rs (8) = .613, p = .007 and r = .485, p = .041, respectively. 

For other sub-scales (Nausea, Oculomotor, Disorientation, 

Total and Accuracy), there were no significant correlations.

V.  DISCUSSION 
The results show differences in Nausea, Oculomotor, and 
Disorientation  among  the  three  techniques or  versions.  First, 
we  did  find  2DVR,  the  version  based  on  the  2D  frame 
technique, was better than 3DVR in Nausea and Oculomotor, 
indicating that 2DVR could make users feel lower VRS. This 
finding is aligned with the expectation that Teleport performed 
better than 3DVR in Oculomotor. 2DVR could help mitigate 
some  VRS  symptoms;  however, 
it  could  cause  more 
disorientation than the other versions. Because disorientation 
is  supposedly  one  of  Teleport's  disadvantages  [30],  it  is 
surprising that it was not the worst alternative. Based on  the 
Total score, we did not find it either to be particularly superior 
in mitigating VRS. 

Interestingly,  even  if  Teleport  did  perform  statistically 
better  in  some  aspects  of  VRS,  its  Score  and  Jumps  were 
significantly lower than the other versions. This result indicates 
that  participants  could  not  use  Teleport  well  in  a  fast-paced 
environment,  especially  for  FPS  games  requiring  intense 
operations and a high concentration level. However, we failed 
to find statistical differences between Accuracy in Teleport and 
the other conditions. In other words, these different techniques 
did not stand out regarding their effect on aiming and shooting.  

For  immersion,  3DVR  scored  higher  than  2DVR,  which 
diverged from the  results found in  [6]. This difference could 
have  resulted  in  the  difference  in  controllers.  We  used  a 
handheld  controller,  whereas  the  researchers  in  [6]  used  a 
keyboard  and  mouse,  the  combination  which  led  to  the  best 
performance  in  their  experiment.  We  were  unable  to  find 
statistically  significant  differences  between  Teleport  and 
3DVR.  

By our definition, Jumps were considered a measurement 
of how active users were during gameplay. Hence, it was not 
surprising  that  players  had  higher  scores  when  they  moved 
more frequently. VRS did not appear to correlate with Jumps, 
which  is  somewhat  unexpected  since  movement  can  be 
associated with VRS [42]. 

to  some  extent  but 

Our  results  suggest  that  both  Teleport  and  2DVR  could 
alleviate  VRS 
through  different 
mechanisms.  The  total  changes  in  shooting  position  did  not 
influence  VRS  levels  directly.  It  is  also  worth  noting  that 
players with more jumps had a higher immersion in 3DVR and 
2DVR, indicating that 2DVR could provide enough immersion 
for more active players. 

Regarding the three research questions, besides finding that 
Teleport trades a higher score for lower levels of Nausea and 
Oculomotor  and  higher  Disorientation,  we  were  unable  to 
detect other trade-offs (RQ1). Teleport was not much superior 
to 2DVR in reducing VSRS (RQ2). They both present a similar 
profile in that they have similar trade-offs in VRS. However, 
participants  had  worse  scores  with  Teleport 
(RQ3). 
Movements (Jumps) seem to be positively correlated with the 
score but did not have an influence on  Accuracy. This result 
shows that for players in these three versions, the more active 
they  were,  the  better  performance  they  would  have,  even  if 
players using Teleport had the lowest average Scores. 

From the above results, two main recommendations could 
be extrapolated. First, they suggest that 2DF could be a useful 
yet simple and low-cost technique that can be adopted for FPS 
games because it can lower or minimize VRS while keeping 
the  gameplay  experience  unaffected.  Second,  they  show  that 
Jumps, a measurement for movement and action, could be used 
as  a  possible  marker  for  bottlenecks  in  the  design  of  maps 
because lower Jumps seem to be associated with lower scores 
(i.e., lower performance). 

A. 

Limitations 

The  study  might  have  been  underpowered  to  detect 
differences in completion time. On the other hand, the number 
of participants is within the normal for this kind of experiment 
[43], and it had enough power to detect other important factors 
in the game experience.  

In this study, we did not evaluate different frequencies of 
teleportation and variations of Teleport. However, this does not 
invalidate  our  study,  given  that  we  applied  one  of  the  most 
standard variations of Teleport. The number of teleportations 
performed by the players showed little variation, as presented 
in the Jump sections, which might indicate that they are within 
what can be expected for normal gameplay.  

VI.  CONCLUSION 

In this paper, we explored the effect of Teleport and a visual 
reduction  technique  on  players'  performance  and  gameplay 
when  playing  a  first-person  shooter  (FPS)  game  in  virtual 
reality (VR). In particular, we assessed whether they could help 
lower the level of VR sickness (VRS) and their trade-offs. Our 
results suggest that, although Teleport is suitable for mitigating 
VRS, it could also lead to lower performance compared to the 
other technique, which reduced the 3D view into a 2D view. 
Teleport led to lower scores and limited movement while only 
reducing VRS by just a small margin than  the 2D technique. 
Our results show that the 2D reduction technique is useful and 
low-cost  and  can  be  adopted  for  FPS  games  because  it  can 
lower  or  minimize  VRS  symptoms  while  keeping  the 
gameplay experience unaffected.
