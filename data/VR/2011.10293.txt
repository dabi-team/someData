Abstract

The reliability of current virtual reality (VR) delivery is low due to the limited resources on VR head-

mounted displays (HMDs) and the transmission rate bottleneck of sub-6 GHz networks. In this paper, we

propose a dual-connectivity sub-6 GHz and mmWave heterogeneous network architecture empowered

by mobile edge capability. The core idea of the proposed architecture is to utilize the complementary

advantages of sub-6 GHz links and mmWave links to conduct a collaborative edge resource design,

which aims to improve the reliability of VR delivery. From the perspective of stochastic geometry,

we analyze the reliability of VR delivery and theoretically demonstrate that sub-6 GHz links can be

used to enhance the reliability of VR delivery despite the large mmWave bandwidth. Based on our

analytical work, we formulate a joint caching and computing optimization problem with the goal to

maximize the reliability of VR delivery. By analyzing the coupling caching and computing strategies at

HMDs, sub-6 GHz and mmWave base stations (BSs), we further transform the problem into a multiple-

choice multi-dimension knapsack problem. A best-ﬁrst branch and bound algorithm and a difference of

convex programming algorithm are proposed to obtain the optimal and sub-optimal solution, respectively.

Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance improvement using the proposed algorithms, and

reveal that caching more monocular videos at sub-6 GHz BSs and more stereoscopic videos at mmWave

BSs can improve the VR delivery reliability efﬁciently.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the interest of virtual reality (VR) in academia and industry has been un-

precedented [1]. To achieve the immersive experience, the most important task is to increase the

resolution of VR applications to the resolution of human eyes [2]. It is impractical to cache all

rendered VR videos locally at VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) in advance, especially in the

scenarios where user interactions are required. Moreover, users prefer to experience VR videos

anytime and anywhere, compared with being tied down by wired cables. Therefore, VR videos

are expected to be delivered real-time over wireless networks. However, the bandwidth required

for delivering VR videos is usually 4-5 times the bandwidth required for delivering conventional

high-deﬁnition videos [3], which puts tremendous pressure on the network bandwidth. On the

other hand, VR applications are typical ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC)

applications, and the end-to-end delay exceeding 20 ms can cause dizziness of users [4]. Thus,

it is essential to ensure the high reliability of VR delivery networks, which means that ensuring

more data packets delivered to HMDs within the latency requirement of VR applications for a

satisfactory VR viewing experience. In this regard, two fundamental problems for VR delivery

should be addressed: 1) How to enhance the reliability of VR delivery when delivering a large

amount of video data over wireless networks, and 2) how to enhance the reliability of VR

delivery when performing time-consuming projecting and rendering of raw VR viewpoints?

For the ﬁrst problem, using the current sub-6 GHz network is limited by the bottleneck of

wireless bandwidth and cannot meet the URLLC requirements of VR applications. The sufﬁcient

spectrum resources brought by millimeter wave (mmWave) communication are considered to

be the key enablers of 5G applications. Sufﬁcient bandwidth resources make it possible to

transmit large-capacity VR videos in real time. However, mmWave signals are prone to be

blocked and suffer severe fading. This poses a great challenge to VR applications, because

users may frequently experience blockage caused by buildings, human bodies, and environmental

facilities. To tackle the problem, dual-connectivity (DC) sub-6 GHz and mmWave heterogeneous

networks (HetNets) are promising for enhancing the reliability of VR delivery. DC is an appealing

technique for performance enhancement in wireless networks, and it allows the user to have two

simultaneous connections and utilize both radio resources [5]. Inherently, DC sub-6 GHz and

mmWave HetNets utilize the complementary advantages of the wide signal coverage in sub-6

GHz networks and sufﬁcient spectrum resources in mmWave networks, which is suitable for

3

reliability enhancement of VR delivery.

For the second problem, computation ofﬂoading is seen as a key enabler to provide the required

video projection rendering capabilities for VR delivery. Edge computing servers are suitable for

performing high CPU- and GPU-intensive computing tasks. By providing efﬁcient computing

resources close to users, mobile edge computing (MEC) strikes a balance between communication

delay and computing delay. Speciﬁcally, the HMD can upload the tracking information (e.g.,

game actions or viewpoint preferences) to the MEC server to ofﬂoad computing tasks. In this

case, the MEC server uses the computing resources to project monocular videos (MVs) into

stereoscopic videos (SVs), and sends the downlink SVs to the HMD. In addition, the caching

capability of MEC servers can help save the projection and rendering time.

Based on the above discussion, in this paper, we propose a mobile-edge empowered DC sub-

6 GHz and mmWave HetNet architecture, and aim to conduct a collaborative design of edge

network resources to enhance the reliability of VR delivery.

A. Related Work

1) Reliability Enhancement for Wireless Transmission: Ultra-reliable communication has be-

come the vital support of mission-critical 5G applications. Mei et al. [6] proposed a reliability

guaranteed resource allocation scheme in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks. Guo et al. [7]

extended the research to perform a reliability-aware resource allocation in V2V networks based

only on large-scale fading channel information. Popovski et al. [8] analyzed the fundamental

tradeoffs between ultra-reliability and some other metrics (i.e., latency, bandwidth occupancy

and energy consumption) for wireless access. Recently, the joint application of sub-6 GHz and

mmWave in HetNets has been proposed as an attractive solution to improve the network perfor-

mance [9]. Semiari et al. [10], [11] introduced DC mode into sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNets

to ensure data transmission reliability while considering the user association and scheduling.

DC implements carrier aggregation between sites through base station coordination to realize

diversiﬁed association, which can reduce the handover failure and wireless link failure, thus

improving the transmission reliability. DC mode has been extended to multi-connectivity (MC)

mode in [12], [13], which enables simultaneous connections of multiple air interfaces such as

cellular, device-to-device (D2D) and WiFi links to further support ultra-reliable applications.

2) DC-assisted mobile edge computing: Some prior works proposed to use DC technology for

mobile edge computing to achieve energy-efﬁcient computation ofﬂoading performance. Guo et

4

al. [14] studied the problem of computation ofﬂoading for multi-access mobile edge computing

in ultra-dense networks to reduce the overall energy consumption. Guo et al. [15] also extended

the scenario in [14] to the energy-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices with DC capability

to tackle the conﬂict between resource-hungry mobile applications and energy-constrained IoT

devices. Authors in [16], [17] investigated DC-assisted computation ofﬂoading scheme in non-

orthogonal multiple access system to minimize the total energy consumption. Note that these

works mainly focused on utilizing DC-assisted mobile edge computing to achieve green-oriented

computation ofﬂoading for data services. However, the beneﬁts of both edge caching and the

complementary sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands to the delay-sensitive VR application in the

DC-assisted mobile edge computing scenario have not been investigated.

3) Mobile Edge Computing for VR Delivery: Authors in [2], [18], [19] inspired the use of

MEC resources for VR delivery to obtain the potential performance gain, but they did not

establish theoretical formulation and provided efﬁcient algorithms. Some efﬁcient task ofﬂoading

algorithms in wireless cellular networks with MEC were proposed in [20]–[24]. The MEC task

ofﬂoading technology was introduced for the delivery of VR video in [25]–[27]. Sun et al. [25]

focused on balancing the local and edge computing resources to maximize the average bandwidth

usage for VR delivery. Dang et al. [26] extended the scenario in [25] to an edge fog computing

network to achieve an economical computing ofﬂoading scheme that minimized the average

delay for VR delivery. Chakareski et al. [27] proposed an edge server cooperation framework

to efﬁciently ofﬂoad the local computing tasks. It is worth noting that [25]–[27] focused on

improving the average bandwidth usage or delivery latency in MEC empowered VR delivery

networks. Nevertheless, little work has focused on improving the reliability of VR delivery.

B. Motivation and Contributions

As presented in existing related works, wireless channels and connections have a signiﬁcant

impact on the reliability of data transmission. In the context of VR delivery, these wireless

factors have not been well studied. First, the transmission delay and the reliability of wireless

VR delivery will be randomly affected by the path loss, fading, and signal blockage of wireless

channels. However, the impact of wireless channel ﬂuctuation on the performance of VR delivery

is largely overlooked in the existing literatures. For example, the authors in [26] simpliﬁed the

characteristics of wireless channels as a deterministic value of the minimum allowable trans-

mission rate of each VR viewpoint, without considering the randomness of wireless channels.

5

To this end, some probabilistic analysis is required to more accurately characterize the impact

of wireless channel ﬂuctuation on the transmission delay and the reliability of wireless VR

delivery. Second, although the dual-connectivity sub-6 GHz and mmWave technology has been

proved to improve the reliability of data transmission, existing works on VR delivery mostly

assumed single-connectivity (i.e., one wireless interface) for a HMD (e.g., see [20]–[27]). These

works mainly focused on the task ofﬂoading of VR video projection and rendering in the

MEC scenario. Nevertheless, DC is considered as a promising technology for realizing URLLC

applications, while the resource coordination for VR delivery in DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave

HetNets with edge caching and computing capability is challenging when the interface diversity is

implemented. On the one hand, it is essential to decide whether to deliver the viewpoint over sub-

6 GHz links or mmWave links when the requested viewpoint is not cached locally. This should

not only consider the inﬂuence of the wireless channel conditions, but also consider whether the

requested viewpoint is cached at sub-6 GHz BSs (µBSs) or mmWave BSs (mBSs), as well as

the impact of the limited computation resources of HMDs, µBSs and mBSs on the computation

delay. On the other hand, a proper resource coordination between sub-6 GHz networks and

mmWave networks is vital for adapting the computation-intensive VR videos. Speciﬁcally, local

cache can save the transmission delay of viewpoints at the cost of occupying limited local caching

capacity. Caching simultaneously at µBSs and mBSs can reduce the transmission delay of some

popular viewpoints with a higher probability, but at the cost of occupying more caching capacity

of BSs compared with caching at either µBSs or mBSs. In addition, the caching and computing

strategies in DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNets are coupled. If MVs are cached at µBSs or

mBSs, the caching capacity can be saved, but the computation time for projection is increased.

While caching SVs save the computation time at the cost of more caching capacity.

To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we utilize tools from stochastic geometry

to model the DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave channels and theoretically analyze the reliability

of VR delivery by comprehensively considering the inﬂuence of communication, caching, and

computation (3C). We then perform the resource coordination and jointly optimize the caching

and computing strategy, aiming to ensure higher reliability of VR delivery. The main contributions

of this paper are summarized as follows:

• We present a DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNet architecture empowered by edge caching

and computing capability, aiming to meet the requirement of ultra reliability of VR delivery.

Based on this architecture, we conduct a collaborative design of caching and computing

6

resource utilization that adapts to the complementary advantages of sub-6 GHz and mmWave

links by utilizing a stochastic geometry analytical framework.

• We derive closed-form expressions for the reliability of VR delivery in the DC sub-6

GHz and mmWave HetNet. We propose a link selection strategy based on the minimum-

delay delivery, and derive the VR delivery probability over sub-6 GHz links and mmWave

links. The relationship between the delivery probability and the difference of caching

and computing strategy in sub-6 GHz and mmWave tiers is provided. We theoretically

demonstrate that sub-6 GHz links can be used to enhance the reliability of VR delivery

despite the large mmWave bandwidth.

• Based on the analytical work, the coupling 3C resource allocation can be formulated as

a joint caching and computing optimization problem, which is designed for the feasibility

of practical implementation. By analyzing the coupling relationship between caching and

computing strategies at HMDs, µBSs and mBSs, we transform the problem into a multiple-

choice multi-dimension knapsack problem (MMKP). We propose a best-ﬁrst branch and

bound algorithm (BFBB) by calculating the upper and lower bounds of the MMKP to

obtain the optimal solution. To further reduce the complex of the algorithm, the problem

is transformed into a continuous optimization problem, and the difference of convex pro-

gramming technique is utilized to obtain a sub-optimal solution.

• We conduct numerical evaluation to validate the theoretical analysis of reliability with

respect to several key parameters, such as blockage density, CPU cycles, and cache size of

µBSs/mBSs/HMDs. Numerical simulations show great promise of the proposed DC sub-6

GHz and mmWave HetNet architecture to enhance the reliability of VR delivery. The results

also reveal that it is more advantageous to cache MVs at µBSs and cache SVs at mBSs for

enhancing the reliability efﬁciently.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst introduce the system model in Section

II. We then analyze the reliability of VR delivery over DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNets

and provide the link selection strategy to formulate the joint caching and computing problem in

Section III. In Section IV, we ﬁrst provide the BFBB algorithm based on the computation of upper

and lower bounds of the optimal solution, and a difference of convex programming algorithm with

lower complexity is proposed to maximize the reliability of VR delivery. Numerical simulations

are provided in Section V, and Section VI concludes this paper with summary.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

As illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider the VR delivery in a two-tier dual-connectivity (DC)

sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNet. Similar to [28]–[30], the locations of sub-6 GHz BSs (µBSs),

mmWave BSs (mBSs) and HMDs are modeled as three independent and homogeneous Poisson
Point Processes (PPPs)1, which are denoted by Φµ, Φm, ΦH of densities λµ, λm, λH, respectively.

DC is implemented at HMDs by performing packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer

integration [32], so a HMD can be simultaneously connected to a µBS and a mBS. Instead
of delivering 360◦ VR videos, µBSs and mBSs only deliver the requested MVs and SVs. As

mentioned above, MVs are projected and rendered using the computing resources at BSs or

HMDs to create SVs. The set of all viewpoints is denoted by J = {1, 2, · · · , J}. Each viewpoint

j ∈ J corresponds to an MV and an SV. The data sizes of the j-th MV and SV are denoted by

is at least twice larger than dM

j ≥ 2, due to

In the sub-6 GHz tier, all channels undergo independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh

fading. Without loss of generality, when a HMD located at the origin o requests the j-th viewpoint

from the associated µBS, its received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is given by,

hot-spot areas, the Poisson cluster process (PCP) can be a more realistic model which captures the clustering nature of base
stations and users in hot-spot areas [31]. Modeling the locations of base stations as PCPs will have an impact on the outage
and coverage performance of the HetNet, which will be considered in our future work.

In the mmWave tier, unlike the conventional sub-6 GHz counterpart, mmWave transmissions

are highly sensitive to blockage. We adopt a two-state statistical blockage model for each

mmWave link as in [33], such that the probability of the link to be LOS or NLOS is a function

of the distance between the HMD and its serving mBS. Assume that the distance between them

is r, then the probability that a link of length r is LOS or NLOS can be modeled as

ρL(r) = e−κr, ρN(r) = 1 − e−κr,

(2)

respectively, where κ is a parameter determined by the density and the average size of the

blockages [34]. Under dual-connectivity mode, we consider the blockage effects for the mmWave

tier by using the deﬁned LOS/NLOS probability function. Assume that the antenna arrays at

mBSs and HMDs perform directional beamforming with the main lobe directed towards the

dominant propagation path and having less radiant energy in other directions. For tractability in

the analysis, we adopt a sectorial antenna pattern [35]. Denote θ as the main lobe beamwidth, and

M and m as the directivity gain of main and side lobes, respectively. Then the random antenna

gain/interference G between the mBS and the HMD has 3 patterns with different probabilities,

which is given as

Independent Nakagami fading is assumed for each link. Parameters of Nakagami fading NL

B. Caching and Computing Model

The probability of the service request of the HMD for the j-th viewpoint is pj, j ∈ J .
Considering all J viewpoints, we have (cid:80)J
j=1 pj = 1. µBSs, mBSs, and HMDs all have caching
and computing capabilities. The cache size at µBSs, mBSs, and HMDs is C µ, C m, and C H,

∈ {0, 1} and yq,S

respectively. The caching decision for the MV and SV of the j-th viewpoint is denoted by
yq,M

or SV of the j-th viewpoint is cached at device q, otherwise yq,ω

j = 0. With the cache size

j ∈ {0, 1}, q ∈ {µ, m, H}. yq,ω

j ≤ C q.

j yq,M

j yq,S

j=1 dM

The computing decisions at µBSs, mBSs, and HMDs are considered to process the projection

and rendering. The CPU-cycle frequency of µBSs, mBSs, and HMDs is denoted by fq, q ∈

{µ, m, H}. The average energy consumption constraint of µBSs, mBSs, and HMDs is denoted

by Eq, q ∈ {µ, m, H}. Deﬁne ε as the number of computation cycles required to process the

projection and rendering of one bit input.

According to [36]–[38], the energy consumption of a CPU cycle can be expressed as kq = ηqf 2
q ,
where fq is the CPU-cycle frequency of device q, and ηq is a constant related to the hardware
architecture of device q. The computing decision for the j-th viewpoint is denoted by zq
j ∈ {0, 1},
where zq
j = 0. Then,
the average energy consumption of a device for processing a computing task of a viewpoint
can be calculated by averaging all J viewpoints, which can be expressed as (cid:80)J
j zq
j .
Considering that the HMD is energy-constrained, the average energy consumption of the device

j = 1 indicates that the projection is computed at device q, otherwise zq

for processing a computing task of a viewpoint should be limited, otherwise the onboard battery

will be depleted quickly, and the device will heat up due to the overload of the CPU, which will

degrade the user experience. Therefore, a constraint of the average energy consumption of the
device (cid:80)J
j zq
j ≤ Eq should be satisﬁed, which can ensure that the CPU of the device
will not be overloaded.

In the case where the requested viewpoint cannot be found in HMD cache, µBS cache or mBS

cache, the requested viewpoint is retrieved from the core network through the ﬁber backhaul
links with an extra backhaul retrieving delay τ r

III. RELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF VR DELIVERY AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

In order to investigate the reliability performance of VR delivery in DC sub-6 GHz and

mmWave HetNets, we refer to the reliability deﬁned by 3GPP [39], which is the probability

of experiencing an end-to-end latency below the threshold required by the targeted service.

Accordingly, using the law of total probability, the reliability of VR delivery can be expressed

as,

R =

where Tj is the end-to-end latency threshold2 required by the j-th viewpoint, τ l
j, l ∈ {µ, m}
denotes the end-to-end latency when the j-th viewpoint is retrieved over a sub-6 GHz link or

mmWave link. Delay contributions to the end-to-end VR delivery latency include the over-the-
air transmission delay τ l,t

2Instead of assuming a pre-determined minimum allowable transmission rate as in [26], we assume a pre-determined end-to-
end delay threshold for VR viewpoints, which is a more recognized and practical indicator to ensure the user experience of VR
videos, typically no more than 20 ms [4].

[2]. Thus, when the j-th viewpoint is delivered over a sub-6 GHz link or mmWave link, the

end-to-end delay is calculated as

A. Reliability Analysis over DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNets

The reliability of VR delivery is mainly affected by the channel uncertainty of wireless envi-

ronments. In wireless environments where temporary outages are common due to impairments

in SINR, VR’s non-elastic trafﬁc behavior poses additional difﬁculty. In this subsection, we

utilize the statistical wireless channel state information for sub-6 GHz links and mmWave links

described in Sec. II-A to analyze the reliability of VR delivery. Utilizing tools from stochastic

geometry, tractable expressions can be obtained to characterize the reliability of VR delivery.

The computing delay τ l,c

can be expressed as

(8)

Note that the transmission delay over sub-6 GHz links or mmWave links is affected by the

wireless channel ﬂuctuation. Thus, the transmission delay is a random variable related to the

distance between communicating nodes, the channel fading and the blockage probability for
mmWave links. When the computing delay τ l,c

j are obtained
under a given caching and computing strategy, we can obtain the transmission delay threshold
T l,t
j

j and the backhaul retrieving delay τ l,b

for the j-th viewpoint, which is deﬁned as

j = Tj − τ l,c

.

(9)

Then the calculation of the reliability of VR delivery can be transformed into the calculation of
the probability that the transmission delay is less than the threshold T l,t
j .

The data size of the j-th delivered viewpoint over wireless links also depends on the caching

and computing strategy, which can be calculated as

Proof. Please refer to Appendix B.

Taking into consideration the LOS or NLOS channel state, the delivery reliability (13) is the

CCDF of SINR over the mmWave tier. Then some remarks can be concluded from Proposition

2.

Remark 1: The reliability of VR delivery over the mmWave tier (13) indicates that the Laplace

transform of the interference L(r) in (14) is independent of the transmit power Pm.

Remark 2: (13) is a monotonically increasing function with respect to T m,t

j

, and a monotoni-

cally decreasing function with respect to Dm
j .

Remark 3: Considering a special case when the viewpoints are only delivered through LOS

links, then (13) is a decreasing and convex function with respect to the blockage density κ.

For DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave network, according to the addition rule for probability, the

delivery reliability for viewpoint j is calculated as

RDC

(15)

Note that RDC

is the expression of the reliability when the j-th viewpoint is delivered through

wireless links. On the other hand, if the MV or SV of the j-th viewpoint is cached in the HMD,

we assume that the end-to-end delay is less than the delay threshold with probability 1, i.e., the

reliability is set to 1. Therefore, the complete expression of the reliability can be written as

where 1(·) is the indicator function.

B. Link Selection Strategy and Problem Formulation

Since the DC mode is adopted at HMD, it is essential to give the criteria for delivery the

viewpoints over the sub-6 GHz link or the mmWave link. In this paper, since the end-to-end

14

delay is the key factor affecting the reliability of VR delivery, we propose the minimum-delay

delivery criteria in DC mode as the link selection strategy, which can be written as

l0 = arg min
l∈{µ,m}

τ l
j.

(17)

Proposition 3. When the j-th viewpoint is not locally cached by the HMD, based on the

minimum-delay delivery criteria, the probability that the mmWave link is selected to deliver

the viewpoint is given as,

Am

j =

(cid:90) ∞

, τ0 = τ m,c

j + τ m,b

j − τ µ,c

, and (·)+ = max(·, 0).

Proof. According to (17), the delivery probability over mmWave links can be expressed as

Am

j = P[τ m

j < τ µ

j ] = P[τ m,t

j < τ µ,t

j − τ0],

(19)

where τ0 = τ m,c

(20)

Accordingly, the probability that the mmWave link is selected to deliver the viewpoint is given

as Am

j = 1 − Aµ

j . Proposition 3 can be used to calculate the expected amount of transmitted data
over the sub-6 GHz link and the mmWave link. Thus, the expected number of MVs computed

at the µBS, mBS, and the HMD can be obtained, respectively.

Note that τ0 represents the difference of the delays (except for the transmission delays) between

mmWave links and sub-6 GHz links, where τ l,c
j
(8), respectively. From Remark 2, we can deduce that Am
j

, τ l,b
j

, l ∈ {µ, m} can be calculated by (7) and

is decreasing with τ0, which indicates

that the caching and computing strategy will have an impact on the delivery probability over

mmWave and sub-6 GHz links. For example, if the blockage density in the mmWave tier is low,

we can adjust the caching and computing strategy to get a smaller value of τ0, thus increasing

the delivery probability over mmWave links to improve the reliability of VR delivery.

Remark 4: From Remark 3 and the delivery probability over mmWave links (18), we conclude

15

that when the viewpoints are only delivered through LOS links, Am
j
function with respect to the blockage density κ. In addition, when κ → ∞, we have Am
and when κ = 0, Am

j → 0,
j < 1. This indicates that mmWave links cannot be utilized when the
blockage density is too high, while sub-6 GHz links can be utilized even if there is no blockage

is a decreasing and convex

for mmWave links. In other words, sub-6 GHz links can be utilized to enhanced the reliability

of VR delivery despite the large mmWave bandwidth.

Next, we can formulate the problem of maximizing the reliability of VR delivery in DC sub-6

GHz and mmWave HetNets by jointly optimizing the caching and computing decision at the

µBS, mBS, and HMD as follow,

constraint. (21c) is the average computing energy consumption at the HMD. (21d) is the average

computing energy consumption at the µBS or mBS. (21e) is the backhaul bandwidth constraint,

and (21f) ensures the binary decision of the caching and computing decision.

Remark 5: Note that the coupling 3C resources are jointly considered in MEC-enabled net-

works for performance improvement, though the communication part is not added as an opti-

mization variable in Problem P1. Speciﬁcally, the communication strategy Al

j is affected by the
caching and computing strategies reﬂected by τ0 as shown in Eq. (18), while the caching and

computing strategies in the formulated Problem P1 are affected by the communication strategy

Al

j involved in constraints (21c)–(21e). From the perspective of practical implementation, the
caching placement phase is prior to the viewpoint delivery phase (e.g., caching placement is

performed during off-peak time), so it is impractical to perform a joint communication, caching

and computing optimization. Instead, the caching and computing strategies are optimized based

on the probabilistic communication decision derived in Proposition 3, then the caching and

computing decisions can be determined by solving Problem P1, which is a practical solution for

16

3C resource optimization.

C. Problem Reformulation

Problem P1 is difﬁcult to solve because the objective function (21a) and the constraint (21e)

contain logical operations. Fortunately, we can explore the coupling relationship between the

caching and computing strategies to greatly reduce the solution space.

Lemma 1. For any viewpoint j ∈ J , the following caching and computing relationships hold,

(cid:107)yµ,S

j + zH

j = 1, then zl

j

(cid:107)ym,S
j

) ≤ 1,

j = 1 holds, l ∈ {µ, m}.

Proof. 1) means that the HMD and the MEC server (at the µBS or mBS) should not cache the

j-th viewpoint simultaneously. This is because when the j-th viewpoint is cached at the HMD,

the reliability is set to 1, thus there is no need to cache it at the MEC server.

2) means that there is no need to cache the MV and the SV of the j-th viewpoint simultaneously

at the HMD or the MEC server. This is because the caching and the computing strategy

is determined before delivering the j-th viewpoint, and caching MV or SV is two different

strategies, which should not exist simultaneously.

3) holds because when the MV of the j-th viewpoint is cached at the µBS or mBS, it should

be computed either at the MEC server or at the HMD. On the other hand, the computing strategy

over the sub-6 GHz link can be different from that over the mmWave link.

According to Lemma 1, the caching and computing strategies are coupled, which can be used

to reduce the solution space to 18 joint caching and computing strategies for the j-th viewpoint,

of the j-th viewpoint in the form of 9-tuple as

which are listed in Table II. In Table II, we rewrite the joint caching and computing strategies
yµ,S zµ, ym,M ym,S zm(cid:105)
.
To distinguish whether the MVs computed at the HMD is cached locally, or cached at µBSs or
zH(µ)

mBSs, we further rewrite zH

The 18 joint caching and computing strategies can be divided into 4 types based on different

caching strategies, i.e., local caching, caching at µBSs and mBSs simultaneously, caching at

µBSs or mBSs, and backhaul retrieving. In each type, different computing strategies are included.

Detailed descriptions are as follows,

• Local caching (Strategy 1, 2): In this type, the viewpoint j is cached locally at the HMD,

17

i.e. yH,M
j

= 1, or yH,S

j = 1. Since over-the-air transmission and backhaul retrieving are
not required in this case, the viewpoint j can be guaranteed to be obtained in time, so the
delivery reliability is set to 1. When yH,M

Problem P2 is a 18-choice 7-dimensional MMKP problem, which is proved to be NP-hard.

Speciﬁcally, J viewpoints are considered as J classes, while the 18 joint caching and computing

strategies belonging to each class j are considered as 18 items. The problem is to choose one

item from each class such that the proﬁt sum is maximized while satisfying the capacity and

energy consumption constraints.

IV. OPTIMIZATION OF JOINT CACHING AND COMPUTING

A. Optimal solution using BFBB algorithm

We propose a best-ﬁrst branch and bound (BFBB) algorithm to solve the MMKP problem P2.

The key idea of the BFBB algorithm can be described as follows: 1) Compute upper bounds and

lower bounds of the optimal solution and discard branches that cannot produce a better solution

than the best one found so far by the algorithm; 2) Utilize a priority queue to select the node

with the highest priority as the expanded node of the search tree.

1) Computation of upper and lower bound: First, to compute the upper bound of problem P2,

we construct an auxiliary problem P3, which relaxes the constraints into the sum of constraints

(22b)–(22d) as follows,

where (cid:36)jk =

For each viewpoint j, select the joint caching and computing decision k which maximizes

, and denote the corresponding decision as kmax for each viewpoint j. Let RUB denote the
j∈J Rjkmax, then there exist

Rjk
(cid:36)jk
upper bound of problem P3, and let (cid:36)0 = (cid:80)
the following two cases,

j∈J (cid:36)jkmax, R0 = (cid:80)

• (cid:36)0 > C0. In this case, the solution of problem P3 is upper bounded by

(24)

• (cid:36)0 < C0. In this case, the constraint (23b) is not violated when decision xjkmax is selected
for all j ∈ J . The remaining items are merged into the same class L, with items indexed by
(cid:96) = 1, · · · , Nf . The remaining items are sorted in descending order of R(cid:96)
(cid:36)(cid:96)
is converted into choosing the remaining items with the remaining capacity constraint equals
to C0 − (cid:36)0. Adopting greedy algorithm, we select the items in descending order of R(cid:96)
(cid:36)(cid:96)
ﬁll the remaining capacity until the capacity constraint is violated. In particular, denote
ˆ(cid:96) ∈ [1, (cid:96)] the index of the item that violates the remaining capacity constraint C0 − (cid:36)0,
which can be deﬁned as,

. Then, the problem

Then the solution of problem P3 is upper bounded by

Lemma 2. RUB is an upper bound for the auxiliary problem P3 as well as the problem P2.

Proof. The proof can be shown by contradiction for the ﬁrst case ((cid:36)0 > C0) of this lemma.
Suppose that there exists a solution ˆX = (ˆx1k1, · · · , ˆxjkj , · · · , ˆxJkJ ) satisfying problem P3 with

corresponding objective value ˆR = (cid:80)
Since ˆ(cid:36) = (cid:80)

(27)

For the second case ((cid:36)0 ≤ C0), the remaining capacity is ﬁlled with the remaining items as

a knapsack problem, so the upper bound can be obtained also by the greedy algorithm.

Since problem P3 is a relaxed problem of the problem P2, it is obvious that UB is an upper

bound for P2.

To determine an initial feasible solution that can be used as the starting lower bound, we

develop a heuristic algorithm for obtaining the lower bound of problem P2 as described in

Algorithm 1. The algorithm is based on the conception of aggregate resource saving [40]

considering the multiple resource constraints in P2. Speciﬁcally, the solutions for each viewpoint

that achieve lowest reliability is selected as initial solution. The solution is then upgraded by

choosing a new solution for a viewpoint which has the maximum aggregate resource saving while

increasing the objective function of total reliability. The aggregate resource saving is deﬁned as

∆(cid:36)jk = (cid:36)jkj − (cid:36)jk.

(28)

Note that there might be some solutions that violate the constraints but achieve higher reli-

ability. To obtain a tighter lower bound, we downgrade some of the solutions to get a feasible

solution, which may increase the total value of reliability.

2) Best-ﬁrst principle of priority: The candidate nodes to be expanded are stored in the priority

queue, and assume that the level of the search tree where a candidate node is located is denoted

as j0. Deﬁne the best-ﬁrst principle of priority as the maximum upper bounds of the candidate
nodes, which can be calculated as

The best-ﬁrst principle of priority P is the sum of the current reliability value of a candidate

node and its remaining possible reliability value, i.e., the upper bound of problem P4. Note that

the form of problem P4 is the same as that of problem P3, thus the upper bound of problem

P4 can be obtained using the similar method described in Lemma 2.

The advantage of applying the best-ﬁrst principle of priority is that the ﬁrst obtained feasible

solution using the branch and bound searching method achieves the maximum value of reliability

23

of VR delivery, which accelerates the searching process to ﬁnd the optimal solution faster.

3) The proposed BFBB algorithm: In this subsection, we propose the optimal joint caching and

computing solution based on BFBB algorithm to solve problem P2, as described in Algorithm

2. The BFBB algorithm starts by initializing 18 strategies of the ﬁrst viewpoint into the priority

queue, and using Algorithm 1 to obtain the lower bound of the solution. The next node to be

expanded is selected according to the best-ﬁrst principle of priority (29), and the lower bound
is then updated by directly computing the solution of xj0kj0
operation, the feasibility of the expanded child node is veriﬁed, and the upper bound of the

. To perform the branch and bound

extended child node is computed using (29). To accelerate the searching process, the lower

bound RLB is updated using Algorithm 1 in step 13, thus more branches of the search tree
can be pruned in step 11. The optimality of the BFBB algorithm is guaranteed by the best-ﬁrst

principle. Since the nodes added into the PQ all correspond to feasible solutions, when j0 = J,
i.e., at step 5, the algorithm obtains the biggest value such that xJkJ is feasible. Then xJkJ is
the optimal solution for problem P2.

B. Suboptimal solution based on DCP

In this subsection, a suboptimal solution for solving P2 is proposed by using difference of

convex programming (DCP) with lower computation complexity. First, we equivalently transform

P2 into a continuous optimization problem, which can be written as,

P5: min
{xjk}

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

−pjRjkxjk

(31a)

(31b)

(31c)

j∈J

k∈K

(22b), (22c), (22d), (22e),

where the binary variable constraint (22f) in P2 is substituted by continuous variable constraints

(31b) and (31c). Thus, by solving the continuous optimization problem P5, the computation

complexity is greatly reduced compared with that by directly solving P2. Nevertheless, the

constraint (31c) is a concave function instead of a convex function, which becomes the main

difﬁculty for solving P5.

To tackle this difﬁculty, we utilize a penalty function to bring the concave constraint into the

objective function, which can be written as,

(22b), (22c), (22d), (22e), (31b),

where φ is a penalty parameter and φ > 0, f (x) = (cid:80)
k∈K xjk(xjk − 1). To ensure the
equivalence between P5 and P6, according to the exact penalty property of DCP in [41], φ

(cid:80)

(cid:80)

k∈K xjk(1 − xjk) : (22b), (22c), (22d), (22e), (31b)}.

j∈J

Note that the objective function in P6 is in the form of a difference of two convex functions.

Therefore, we adopt DCP to solve this problem as outlined in Algorithm 3. Speciﬁcally, the

objective function is convexiﬁed by the afﬁne minorization function of the second term f (x) in

step 3. The complexity of Algorithm 3 lies in solving a series of convex problems in steps 3-6.

These convex problems can be solved using the polynomial interior point method [42], which

requires a third degree polynomial complexity in terms of the number of variables. Let L be the
total number of iterations, then the complexity of Algorithm 3 is O(L(JK)3), where J is the

number of viewpoints, and K is the number of strategies for the j-th viewpoint.

Remark 6:

It is worth mentioning that the authors in [26] proposed to use the Lagrangian

dual decomposition (LDD) approach to obtain a suboptimal solution of the MMKP problem. The

Lagrangian relaxation method was adopted in [26] to relax all the resource constraints into the

objective function, without considering the speciﬁc structure of the objective function and the

constraints, so it is hard to obtain a high-quality solution close to the optimal solution by using

the LDD approach. Besides, the solution of the Lagrangian relaxed problem is not necessarily

a feasible solution to the original problem, so the initial condition need to be changed multiple

times to obtain a feasible solution of the original problem. In comparison, we ﬁrst equivalently

transform the MMKP problem into a continuous non-convex optimization problem. To deal with

the concave function in the constraints, we exploit the speciﬁc structure of the problem and

bring the concave constraint into the objective function. Note that this is also an equivalent

problem transformation owing to the use of exact penalty property of the DCP problem. Further,

the DCP problem is solved by approximating the penalty function as its afﬁne minorization

function, which can obtain a high-quality feasible solution effectively, and will be validated in

Sec. V.

Remark 7 (Practical Implication): The proposed BFBB and DCP algorithms are implemented

based on the pre-known statistical channel state information of sub-6 GHz and mmWave links,

as well as the pre-known caching, computing and bandwidth resource information, thus they are

ofﬂine algorithms which can obtain the optimal and sub-optimal joint caching and computing

strategy, respectively. The overall decision is get made in two steps in the practical implemen-

tation. First, during the off-peak time, the HMD and the MEC servers obtain the joint caching

and computing strategy by using the proposed BFBB or DCP algorithm, and perform caching

placement according to the caching strategy. Second, in the viewpoint delivery phase, the HMD

calculates the end-to-end delay of sub-6 GHz links and mmWave links based on the channel

state information and the joint caching and computing strategy. Then the HMD selects the link to

receive viewpoint data according to the minimum-delay delivery criteria, thus the communication

strategy can be determined.

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

In this section, the performances of the proposed BFBB and DCP algorithms are evaluated

through numerical simulations. The default parameter values of network environment, mobile

edge resources and VR videos are listed in Table III. The µBSs, mBSs, and HMDs are scattered

in a square area of 1km × 1km based on three independent PPPs with densities listed in Table III,

and the mobility of the HMDs follows the random-walk model [43]. For the sake of comparison,

ﬁve benchmark algorithms are provided including the LDD algorithm used in [26], and the other

four benchmark algorithms listed as follows,

• Local SV caching (LSC): First, the SVs are cached locally at the HMD according to the

descending order of the popularity of the viewpoints until the caching capacity is full. Then,

the remaining SVs are cached at µBSs and mBSs according to the descending order of the

popularity until the caching capacities are full. Then the remaining viewpoints are delivered

via the backhaul.

27

• Local computing with MV caching preferentially (LC-MCP): The MVs are cached at the

HMD according to the descending order of the popularity of the viewpoints until the local

computing resources are fully utilized. If there remains caching capacity, the SVs are cached

until the caching capacity is full. The remaining MVs are cached at µBSs and mBSs until

the edge computing resources or caching capacities are fully utilized.

• µBS-only: Only µBSs are deployed in the VR delivery network, i.e., let λm = 0, and use

the proposed BFBB algorithm to make the joint caching and computing decision.

• mBS-only: Only mBSs are deployed in the VR delivery network, i.e., let λµ = 0, and use

the proposed BFBB algorithm to make the joint caching and computing decision.

A. Reliability Performance of the Proposed Algorithms

We ﬁrst evaluate the reliability of VR delivery with various network parameters as shown in

Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b). It is observed that the BFBB algorithm achieves the highest reliability, and

the DCP algorithm achieves reliability close to that of the BFBB algorithm, which is 97.8% of

that of the BFBB algorithm on average. This is because the proposed algorithms comprehensively

consider the characteristics of the sub-6 GHz link and the mmWave link to determine a joint

caching and computing strategy. Note that the LDD algorithm is not able to achieve the same

reliability performance as the DCP algorithm, which is mainly due to the operation of relaxing

all the constraints into the objective function without exploiting the speciﬁc structure of the

MMKP problem as the DCP algorithm does.

The reliability of VR delivery with various blockage densities is shown in Fig. 2(a). The

blockage model is in accordance with the NLOS probability function deﬁned in Sec. II-A,

and the blockages are generated according to the blockage density parameter κ and the NLOS

probability function. We assume independent LOS probability between different links, i.e.,

potential correlations of blockage effects between links are ignored, which causes negligible

loss of accuracy for performance evaluation [33], [34].

It is observed that the performance of

LC-MCP is better than that of LSC. This is because caching MVs in the HMD can save more

caching capacity and more viewpoints can be cached. Using the local computing capability of the

HMD can help more viewpoints to be played in time. The mBS-only can achieve performance

close to the proposed algorithms when the blockage density is low, while the performance is

signiﬁcantly reduced when the blockage density is increased. This is because the blockage effect

in the mmWave tier causes the link rate to drop rapidly, and the viewpoints cannot be transmitted

through the relatively stable sub-6 GHz link, making the reliability of VR delivery very low.

In contrast, the reliability of VR delivery using the µBS-only strategy remains unchanged with

28

(c)

average running time of the proposed algorithms with various numbers of viewpoints.

various blockage densities. This is because the wireless channel ﬂuctuation of the sub-6 GHz tier

is not affected by the blockages, which makes the reliability independent of blockage factors.

Fig. 2(b) shows the reliability of VR delivery with various delay thresholds. It can be seen

that the proposed BFBB and DCP algorithms also achieve higher reliability. The performance of

LC-MCP is better than that of LSC, especially when the delay threshold is low. This is because

LC-MCP can cache more viewpoints locally or at BSs, eliminating the backhaul retrieve delay,

which is more important when the delay threshold is low. Observing the µBS-only and mBS-only

algorithms, it is seen that mBS-only basically does not change with the increase of the delay

threshold, while µBS-only increases much with the increase of the delay threshold. This indicates

that the CDFs of the coverage probabilities of the two channels have different characteristics,

and it is necessary to combine the complementary advantages of the two channels to achieve

higher reliability.

Fig. 2(c) shows the average running time of the proposed algorithms with various numbers of

viewpoints, which is tested on the computer with an Intel Core CPU i5 with a clock rate of 2.30

GHz, and an RAM with 8 G. It is observed that the DCP algorithm runs much faster than the

BFBB algorithm, especially when the number of viewpoint becomes larger. This indicates that

the DCP algorithm is a more practical algorithm than the BFBB algorithm when applied to the

scenario where the number of viewpoints is large. On the other hand, the BFBB algorithm is also

meaningful, because it can be used to obtain the optimal solution of the MMKP problem, which

can be viewed as the upper bound of the reliability performance in the considered scenario. Based

on this optimal solution, the distance between the results obtained by the suboptimal algorithm

and the optimal algorithm can be calculated, which can be used to quantitatively measure the

performance of the suboptimal algorithm.

Fig. 4. Delivery probability over
mmWave links for various mmWave
network parameters.

The impact of caching capacities of µBSs and mBSs on the reliability of VR delivery is shown

in Fig. 3(a). In general, the reliability is higher with a larger caching capacity. It is observed that

the caching capacity has a greater gain in the reliability of VR delivery over mmWave links.
For example, the reliability is about 0.97 when C µ = 10, C m = 50, while the reliability is about
0.95 when C µ = 50, C m = 10. This is because the SVs cached at mBSs can be delivered over

large-bandwidth mmWave links, so that the SVs can be delivered to the HMD in time.

Fig. 3(b) shows the impact of CPU-cycle frequency reliability of µBSs and mBSs on the

reliability of VR delivery. It is observed that, it is not that the higher the CPU-cycle frequency,

the higher the reliability can be obtained. The reason is analyzed in conjunction with the energy

consumption limitation in the following subsection. Note that the reliability of VR delivery is

more sensitive to fm compared with fµ. In other words, the impact on the reliability is greater
when fm is changed. This is because the mBSs needs to consume more computing resources
to project and render the MVs into SVs, and deliver them over the large-bandwidth mmWave

links. In contrast, the number of MVs computed into SVs at µBSs is relatively small, which

results in less impact on the reliability.

B. Delivery Probability

The delivery probability over mmWave links is validated with various network parameters

as shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the delivery probability over mBSs decreases with

the increase of the blockage density due to the deteriorating channel conditions, which reﬂects

the importance of sub-6 GHz links to enhance the reliability of VR delivery despite the large

mmWave bandwidth. In addition, the delivery probability over mBSs increases when the CPU-

cycle frequency or the caching capacity of mBSs increases. This is because the increase in

caching and computing resources reduces the average end-to-end delay, thus more viewpoints

are delivered over mmWave links according to the minimum delay criterion.

C. Caching and Computing Strategies

We now evaluate the caching and computing strategies to obtain design insights. Fig. 5(a)
shows the proportion of different caching strategies under various fH and EH. It can be seen
that the locally cached viewpoints decrease when the local CPU-cycle frequency fH increases.
This is due to the local energy consumption limitation. Higher computing frequency leads to

higher energy consumption, as shown in Fig. 5(b). Therefore, the proportion of local computing

should be reduced, otherwise it will cause HMD to heat up and reduce the user experience.
Thus, more SVs are cached in the HMD. On the other hand, when fH is unchanged and EH is
increased, the proportion of local caching or simultaneously cached in µBS and mBS increases.

This is because the local energy consumption limitation is loosen, and more MVs can be cached

locally or at BSs. Then more MVs are delivered to the HMD over sub-6 GHz links or mmWave

links and computed into SVs locally, as shown in the proportion of local computing in Fig. 5(b).
It is worth noting that when fH = 109, the proportion of cached at µBS or mBS decreases with
the increase of EH. This is because the energy consumption limitation is strict at HMD when
EH is small, thus more SVs should be cached in the limited caching capacity at µBSs and mBSs
to avoid the backhaul retrieve delay. When EH increases, more MVs can be cached, so more

viewpoints can be cached simultaneously at µBSs and mBSs.

The proportion of cached MVs and SVs under various fH and EH is shown in Fig. 5(c). It
can be seen that SVs are mainly cached at mBSs, while MVs are more cached at µBS. This

indicates that it is beneﬁcial to cache more SVs at mBSs and deliver them over mmWave links,

while cache more MVs at µBSs and deliver them over sub-6 GHz links. This is reasonable,

because delivering more SVs over mmWave links will not increase the transmission delay much

due to the large mmWave bandwidth, and the computing delay is saved. On the contrary, more

MVs can be delivered over sub-6 GHz links due to the relatively low bandwidth.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we propose a dual-connectivity sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNet architecture

empowered by mobile edge capability, with the aim of improving the reliability of VR delivery.

Based on the differentiated characteristics of sub-6 GHz links and mmWave links, we utilize their

complementary advantages to conduct a collaborative design to improve the reliability of VR

delivery. From the perspective of stochastic geometry, we ﬁrst derive closed-form expressions for

the reliability of VR delivery. We propose a link selection strategy based on the minimum-delay

delivery, and derive the VR delivery probability over sub-6 GHz links and mmWave links. We

theoretically show the necessity of sub-6 GHz links to improve the reliability despite the large

mmWave bandwidth. We then formulate a joint caching and computing optimization problem

to maximize the reliability of VR delivery. By analyzing the coupling caching and computing

strategies, we further transform the problem into a MMKP and propose a BFBB algorithm to

obtain the optimal solution. To further reduce the complexity of the algorithm, we leverage DCP

algorithm to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance

improvement using the proposed algorithms, and shows great promise to improve the VR delivery

reliability in mobile-edge empowered DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNets.

In future work, a prospective direction is to improve the quality of experience (QoE) for

VR users in DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNets. The QoE of VR video transmission is

inﬂuenced by many factors such as the video rendering, quality of viewpoints, end-to-end delay,

and delivery reliability, which is more challenging for modeling and optimization. A QoE-driven

cross-layer design framework for mobile-edge empowered DC sub-6 GHz and mmWave HetNets

is anticipated, in which resource coordination that dynamically adapts to network conditions can

be designed to achieve QoE enhancement.
