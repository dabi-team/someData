ABSTRACT

We investigate the origins of the photometrically Very Red and Less Red Trans-Neptunian Objects.
We ﬁrst reanalyse the dataset of Marsset et al. (2019) and ﬁnd that, in addition to the known color-
inclination correlation in hot TNOs, a similar trend exists for color-eccentricity. We show that VR
TNOs are sharply constrained to eccentricities < 0.42 and inclinations < 21◦, leading to a paucity of
VR scattered disk and distant MMR objects. We then interpret these ﬁndings using N-body simula-
tions accounting for Neptune’s outward migration into a massless particles disk, and ﬁnd that these
observations are best reproduced with a LR-to-VR color transition line between ∼ 38 and 42 AU in
the primordial disk, separating the objects’ formation locations. For an initial surface density proﬁle
(Σ ∝ 1/r2), a color transition around 38 AU is needed to explain the high abundance of VR plutinos
but creates too many VR scattered disk objects, while a transition line around 42 AU seems to better
reproduces the scattered disk colors but creates virtually no VR plutinos. Our simulations furthermore
show that the rarity of VR particles at high eccentricity is possibly due to the absence of sweeping
higher order MMRs, and secular resonances, beyond 42 AU. Inspecting individual populations, we
show that the majority of VR SDOs originate as objects trapped in Neptune’s second and third order
MMRs. These then evolve due to diﬀusion, scattering, Kozai-Lidov cycles, and secular resonances into
their current orbits. Future unbiased color surveys are crucial to better constrain the TNOs dynamical
origins.

1. INTRODUCTIONS

Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) are fossils from the early days of the solar system, and give us a wealth of
information about its formation and evolution. In particular, the orbits of these objects can be used to constrain the
dynamical history of the giant planets, and their chemical composition can be linked to that of the protosolar nebula
in which they formed. Observationally, multiple TNOs dynamical groups have been identiﬁed and characterized.
These include ﬁrst the classical Kuiper belt situated between 42 and 48 AU, with two subcomponents: the cold
classicals with inclinations less than ∼ 5-6 degrees, and the hot classicals with higher inclinations and more complex
dynamical histories. Second are the resonant TNOs, consisting of objects trapped in a mean motion resonance (MMR)
with Neptune, with the 3:2 MMR (Plutinos) at 39.5 AU containing the largest number of known TNOs. The third
major TNOs dynamical group is the scattered disk (SDOs), consisting of high eccentricity and semimajor axis objects
scattered outward after close encounters with Neptune. These have mostly perihelions between 30 and 40 AU. Finally,
the detached objects are extreme SDOs that are now largely detached from the gravitational inﬂuence of Neptune.

Ali-Dib et al.

We refer the reader to the reviews of Gladman et al. (2008); Morbidelli et al. (2008); Nesvorn´y (2018); Morbidelli &
Nesvorn´y (2020) and the references therein for more detailed informations on the Kuiper belt and its structures.

Many Solar System dynamical evolution models have been invoked to try to explain the eccentricity and inclination
structure of TNOs over the years. While these models can now account for the overall shape of these structures,
we are still far from fully understanding how did the Kuiper Belt evolve into its current form. The ﬁrst dynamical
group to unveil some of its secrets were the resonant objects, where Malhotra (1993, 1995, 1996) showed these to be a
natural consequence of Neptune’s outward migration over multiple astronomical units to its current orbit. Neptune’s
migration also explains the origins of SDOs, as objects that were scattered outwards by Neptune during its migration
instead of getting trapped in a resonance, colliding with a planet, or escaping the Kuiper Belt (Duncan et al. 1995;
Luu et al. 1997). The cold classical belt on the other hand was originally thought to also be a result of Neptune’s
migration (Levison & Morbidelli 2003). Subsequent studies of the abundance and dynamical fragility of binaries in this
population however strongly implied that the majority of cold classicals must have formed in-situ (Parker & Kavelaars
2010; Petit et al. 2011; Nesvorn´y et al. 2011; Fraser et al. 2017; Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2019). Finally, the formation
of the hot classical population is yet to be fully understood, as models have not yet converged on an interpretation for
its higher-end of the inclination distribution. While Nesvorn´y (2015b) initially proposed that this might be due to a
very slow migration of Neptune, Volk & Malhotra (2019) proposed that the giant planets secular architecture plays a
more important role. More recently, Nesvorn´y (2020a) and Nesvorn´y (2020b) pointed out that these diﬀerences can be
explained by the diﬀerent assumptions for Neptune’s eccentricity evolution. While Volk & Malhotra (2019) adopted
a very low eccentricity and considered higher inclinations migration of Neptune, Nesvorn´y (2015b)’s results apply to
a regime of migration where Neptune eccentricity is modestly excited to ∼ 0.1 and then damped. The ν8 resonance
acts in this case to implant bodies in the Kuiper belt.

While simple models where Neptune migrates outward on a ∼ 10 Myr timescale into a mildly stirred up primordial
planetesimals disk reproduces an overall sketch of the Kuiper Belt (Hahn & Malhotra 2005), these usually fail to
explain the ﬁner details of these structures. Smooth migration models for example lead to an overabundance of
resonant particles, while in reality non-resonant orbits are more common by a factor 2-4 (Gladman et al. 2012).
This led Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y (2016) to propose that Neptune’s migration was “grainy”, physically caused by
interacting with a smaller number of Pluto-size bodies, in contrast with smooth migration. Kaib & Sheppard (2016)
then investigated the eﬀects of such migration on high-perihelion objects near the 3:1 MMR. Another peculiar feature
of the Kuiper belt is the “kernel”, a concentration of dynamically cold orbits around a = 44 AU (Petit et al. 2011).
While the origins and exact nature of this kernel is still far from being understood, Nesvorn´y (2015a) proposed that
it might be due to a sudden jump in Neptune’s semimajor axis during its migration due to a global instability in the
solar system. More recently, Gomes (2020) proposed that the kernel could be caused by an initial sharp edge around
44.5 AU, and subsequent diﬀusion of cold classical bodies from inside that edge.

Another line of evidence that can shed light on the dynamical history of the Kuiper Belt and the giant planets is
the chemical composition of TNOs, observed in proxy through their surface colors. One of the earlier such studies was
Tegler & Romanishin (1998); Tegler et al. (2003) who observed a “gray-red” (now termed “Less Red” (LR) and “Very
Red” (VR)) color bimodality in a sample of ∼ 15 then 91 diverse KBOs. This was followed by Peixinho et al. (2003)
who showed a bimodality in the colors of centaurs in particular, where roughly half of their ∼ 20 objects sample were
blue–gray, and the rest were very red. Using a large survey of 109 objects, Peixinho et al. (2004) noticed a correlation
between the inclination and color of the classical belt objects. This was conﬁrmed further in Peixinho et al. (2008) who
found that hot classicals with inclinations ≥ 10◦ were mostly blue, while cold classicals are dominantly VR. The cold
classicals were examined furthermore by the Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS; Schwamb
et al. 2019) who found them to be almost entirely VR (Peixinho et al. 2004; Fraser et al. 2017), with distinct surface
characteristics from the much rarer dynamically excited VR objects (Pike et al. 2017). The hot classicals were also
reexamined through surveys by Peixinho et al. (2012); Fraser & Brown (2012); Wong & Brown (2017) who concluded
that these separately also show a strong color bimodality with the same shape as that found in centaurs. Finally,
Marsset et al. (2019) (hereafter M2019) also examined a sample of hot classicals, centaurs, resonant, and scattered
objects using a dataset based on (but not exclusively) Col-OSSOS data for which discovery biases were modelled, and
reported that VR TNOs are strongly limited to inclinations less than ∼ 21◦. They hence concluded that a strong
color-inclination correlation exists in this dataset, that persists even when considering the diﬀerent sub-components
individually. They however stated that such correlation does not exist for eccentricity.

Eccentricity-color correlation

In section 2 of this paper, we ﬁrst reanalyse the dataset of M2019, and ﬁnd an overlooked strong correlation between
the eccentricity and color of hot classicals caused by diﬀerent objects than those responsible for the color-inclination
correlation. We then show that VR TNOs in this sample are strongly limited to eccentricities less than ∼ 0.42.
The scattered disk is hence found to be strongly dominated by LR objects, as hinted to by Peixinho et al. (2004)
and corroborated by M2019. This is in addition to the strong paucity of LR objects at inclinations > 21 deg found
by M2019. We conclude that VR TNOs are strongly contained to orbits with values below these two values in e-
inc space.
In section 3, we model and interpret these observations using N-body simulations, and investigate the
dynamical histories of the VR contaminants in the dominantly LR high eccentricity or inclination populations. We
ﬁnally summarize our results and conclude in section 4.

2. A REANALYSIS OF THE DATASET OF MARSSET ET AL.

2.1. Eccentricity vs color

In Fig. 1 we plot the eccentricities and inclinations of the M2019 sample as a function of the spectral slopes. Both
distributions show strong bimodality. First, as reported by M2019, TNOs with inclinations higher than ∼ 21◦ are
almost exclusively LR (also referred to as gray or neutral objects), with an observed LR/VR ratio of ∼ 8.16 if all
bodies are included. Second, we ﬁnd that the eccentricity distribution clearly shows a similar behavior, where objects
with eccentricities larger than ∼ 0.42 are predominantly LR with a LR to VR ratio of 5.37. This plot also shows that
a) the LR (aka “gray”, “neutral”) class is only found at e>0.4 for distant populations (scattered, detached, distant
resonant), and b) the VR (aka “red”) class is almost never found at e>0.4 for these distant populations. This is
discussed in more details in the next subsections.

We statistically test if the VR and LR populations have diﬀerent eccentricity distributions using using Kol-

mogorov–Smirnov (KS) and Anderson–Darling (AD) tests.

By considering the LR and VR sub-samples, a 2-sample KS test on the eccentricity distributions returns a statistic

of 0.19. The two samples Anderson-Darling on the other hand returns a statistic of 4.19.

To calculate the p-values of these statistics we freeze the LR eccentricity sample, then repeatedly bootstrap with
replacement a simulated VR sample from the frozen LR sample of equal size as the observed VR sample, then calculate
the probability that a random sample produces a test statistic larger than the observed population. This provides a
direct measure of the distribution of the statistic under the hypothesis that all objects are drawn from the LR sample.
We ﬁnally obtain p-values of 0.23% for the KS test, and 0.085% for the AD test, implying a ≥ 99% probability that
the LR and VR sub-samples have distinct eccentricity distributions. Both statistical tests therefore strongly suggest
that the LR and VR sub-samples have two distinct distributions.

Now we redo the same analysis, but accounting for the error bars on the color measurements. Our method consist
of bootstrapping the color and eccentricity distributions, but while replacing each color measurement with a value
uniformly sampled from its entire uncertainty interval. New color values are sampled with each bootstrap sampling.
We now ﬁnd the KS and AD tests p-values to be 0.2% and 0.05%, respectively. The two color sub-populations hence
are still very probably distinct even when accounting for the observational error bars.

Finally, the same analysis can be redone while excluding centaurs from the dataset, as these are a transient popula-
tion. For TNOs with inclinations higher than ∼ 21◦ we get a LR/VR ratio of 9.25, and for eccentricities larger than
∼ 0.42 we get a LR to VR ratio of 6.16. For these cases, the color-eccentricity 2 samples KS and AD tests statistics
are respectively 0.20 and 3.92, with p-values of 0.3% and 0.05% when accounting for the error bars.

2.2. Eccentricity vs inclination

Now we investigate whether the eccentricity-color and inclination-color correlations are related, as would be the case
for example if the eccentricities and inclinations of a given dominant population are highly correlated. In Fig. 3 we plot
the data on an eccentricity-inclination diagram, while showing the LR vs VR populations (left), and then separating
them into diﬀerent dynamical groups (center and right). We divide these plots into 4 quadrants. Q1 and Q2 contain
objects with e ≥ 0.42, while Q2 and Q3 contain objects with inc ≥ 21◦. The LR to VR ratios of these 4 quadrants are
respectively 3.125, 16.0, 5.0, and 0.93. Hence the sole quadrant with near unity ratio is Q4 containing the dynamically
colder objects. We conclude that VR TNOs are strongly limited in eccentricity-inclination space to below e = 0.42 and
inc = 21 deg. The high eccentricity or inclination populations only have Q2 in common (objects with simultaneously
high eccentricity and inclination), and hence it is worth investigating whether the color correlations survive if we
exclude these objects. First, by inspecting Q3 (inc ≥ 21◦ but e ≤ 0.42), it is clear that this population is diverse,

slope less than 20.6 [%/(103˚A)]) according to their photometric surface color, while VR (red) objects are to the right of the
line. Both orbital quantities show a strong correlation with color, where VR objects are strongly limited to inclinations less
than 21◦ as noticed by M2019, but also to eccentricities less than 0.42. The observed VR to LR ratio of low eccentricity or
inclination objects is around unity. While the high inclination LR objects are a mix of diﬀerent dynamical populations, the high
eccentricity LR objects are dominated by the scattered disk and high order mean motion resonances.

with multiple dynamical groups contributing to the inclination-color correlation as found by M2019. Inspecting Q1
however (inc ≤ 21◦ but e ≥ 0.42), we notice that they are predominantly scattered disk objects (the roles of individual
subpopulations are discussed in the next subsection).

When excluding Q2, the eccentricities 2-samples (LR and VR) KS test statistic drops to 0.15 with a p-value of
2.35%. It is hence statistically possible, but not certain, that the eccentricity-color correlation holds when excluding
high inclination objects. If it does, this would imply that the two correlations have diﬀerent physical origins, and
are not due to eccentricity-inclination correlated sub-populations. Performing a Spearman correlation test on the
eccentricties and inclinations of the entire dataset, we ﬁnd a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.18, with a p-value of 0.45% .
This hints that only a modest correlation exists between the two quantities in the dataset.

2.3. Individual populations

In Fig. 1 we also show the diﬀerent dynamical groups for all objects in the dataset. For ease of comparison,
we additionally plot the eccentricity vs spectral slope of the M2019 dataset objects, for the 5 dynamically distinct
subpopulations, in Fig. 2. To further test if the eccentricity-color correlation is dominated by a single dynamical
subpopulation, we will repeat the statistical tests of section 2.1 for each individual dynamical groups. The results are
summarized in table 1. We have excluded the classical Kuiper belt objects as all of them have eccentricities lower than
0.2, and are distributed almost evenly between LRs and VRs.

2.3.1. Centaurs

We ﬁrst start with centaurs, and ﬁnd a KS test statistic of 0.25, but a p-value of 18.6%. The AD test statistic is
-0.69 with a p-value 61.2%. Therefore, from our dataset, the LR and VR centaurs have indistinguishable eccentricity
distribution.

2.3.2. Resonant objects

For resonant bodies, we get a KS test statistic of 0.12, and a p-value of 46.5%. The AD test statistic here is -0.29
with a p-value of 85.3%. However note that, as seen in the Resonant objects panels of Fig. 2, while the plutinos contain
both LR and VR bodies, all objects beyond the 5:2 MMR are LR. This implies that higher order resonances, that
co-exist with the scattered disk, seem to contribute to the eccentricity-color correlation. As VR objects mostly have
ecc<0.42, it is expected that the color-eccentricity correlation does not exist in resonances interior to the 5:2 because
any object reaching e=0.42 in those populations would cross Neptune’s orbit and be scattered on short timescales.

Finally, we consider only scattered disk objects. In this case, the KS test statistic is 0.40, with a p-value of 17.5%,
and the AD test statistic is +1.18 with a p-value of 7.9%. This implies that the LR and VR scattered disk samples
have a 7.9% or 17.5% chance of being drawn from the same parent distributions, depending on the statistic test.

2.3.3. Scattered disk objects

2.3.4. Conclusions

Put together, these statistics imply that the eccentricity distribution diﬀerence between the two color groups is
caused by gray/LR objects strongly dominating in number in the scattering disk (and to a lesser extent, in the
detached object population but they are less numerous in our sample), and in high-order resonances where e > 0.42
is allowed. Moreover, this suggest that any Kuiper Belt formation model attempting to explain the data should
simultaneously account for the lack of VR objects in the scattered disk, and their signiﬁcant presence in the 3:2 MMR.

respectively. Center and right panels: Same as above, but showing the dynamical classiﬁcations of the objects, with the LR and

3.1. Numerical setup

In this section we interpret the observational results above using N-body simulations. The broad brush goal is to
put forward a theoretical framework to interpret the dynamical origins of the color-eccentricity and color-inclination
correlations, and use these to extract informations on the history of the solar system and the protoplanetary disk in
which it formed.

All simulations in the work were done using the REBOUND N-body integrator (Rein & Liu 2012; Rein & Tamayo 2015;
Rein & Spiegel 2015), along with its REBOUNDx add-ons package (Tamayo et al. 2020). Simulations were performed
using the MERCURIUS hybrid integrator that combines the fast and symplectic Wisdom-Holman integrator WHFAST,
with the slower and non-symplectic but 15th-order precision IAS15 integrator to eﬃciently resolve close encounters.
This integration scheme is analogous to MERCURY (Chambers 1999). We set ∆t = 0.5 yr for WHFAST, while IAS15 has
adaptive timestepping that we limit to a minimum of 10−4 yr. In WHFAST we turn oﬀ the whfast.safe mode ﬂag and
turn on the symplectic correctors up to 11th-order for a signiﬁcant increase in both accuracy and performance over
the default settings.

We set the critical radius inside of which the integration scheme switches the integrator from the fast WHFAST to the
more accurate IAS15 to a standard 3 Hill radii. Therefore, this is the radius at which the integrator assumes that a
close encounter is taking place. We ﬁnd that while smaller values lead to an unnacceptable loss of information, larger
values have a signiﬁcant numerical cost with diminishing return. For Neptune at its current location, the critical radius
is roughly 2.3 AU. Moreover, we follow Volk & Malhotra (2019) in modifying MERCURIUS to exclude the planets from
being ﬂagged as undergoing close encounters. The integrator will hence always integrate the planets with WHFAST, and,
during close encounters, switch to IAS15 only for test particles. This ensures that close encounters with planets do
not aﬀect their orbital histories, allowing them to be bitwise reproducible and machine independent. This modiﬁed
version of MERCURIUS is available upon request.

The system is initiated with the 4 giant planets on orbits summarized in table 2. Jupiter and Saturn start on their
current orbits, with their eccentricities and inclinations damped by a factor 2. Uranus and Neptune start signiﬁcantly
inward to their current orbits, and are then forced to migrate outwards on an e-folding timescale τm that we set to
60 Myr. Migration is implemented using a new REBOUNDx custom force analogous to the pre-existing modify-orbits-
forces. The new force, called exponential-migration, is now part of the standard Reboundx library, and is available
for general use. This force applies continuous velocity kicks to the particles :

The reasoning behind this simpliﬁed migration scheme is twofold. First, since our main goal is to gain an under-
standing into the origins of the eccentricity-color correlation, a simple model is easier to interpret and keep track of
the relevant physical processes. Second, the additional processes modeled in the more complicated models are usu-
ally introduced to explain some of the ﬁner details of the Kuiper Belt such as the abundance of bodies in individual
resonances, and the properties of the “kernel”. Since the number of objects in our observed dataset is limited, and
detailed statistical analysis of individual populations is not possible due to untracetable observational biases being
present in the colours sample, such additional model complexities are unlikely to allow for further signiﬁcant insights
at this point.

Our choice of τa (60 Myr) is motivated by the results of Nesvorn´y (2015b) who suggested that the ﬁnal inclinations
distribution of TNOs is strongly correlated to Neptune’s migration speed. However, as discussed in section 1, the
recent results of Volk & Malhotra (2019) suggest that the solar system’s secular structure, mainly the giant planets’
inclination secular modes f6, f7, and f8, also contributes to this distribution. Since these modes are very sensitive to
the planets initial eccentricities and inclinations, we follow Volk & Malhotra (2019) by ﬁne tuning the initial conditions
until we ﬁnd an adequate set of dynamical parameters. We hence run a large set of short simulations (∼ 800 Myr)
with just the 4 giant planets, where we ﬁx all of the parameters for Jupiter and Saturn, while allowing small random
perturbations to the initial semi-major axis (-0.1 < δa < 0.1), eccentricity (0 < δeU < 0.048 and 0 < δeN < 0.0092),
and inclination (0 < δiU [rad] < 0.013 and 0 < δiN [rad] < 0.03) for both Uranus and Neptune. We ﬁnally select the
set of free parameters that lead to the most reasonable giant planets architecture (closest semimajor axis, eccentricity,
and inclination to the observed values). Once these free parameters have been tuned, they are used in all of the
diﬀerent simulations, leading always to the exact same evolution of the planets due to the bitwise reproducibility of
our integration scheme. The exact nominal values we use are reported in the Appendix. The orbital evolution of
Uranus and Neptune in our simulations is shown in Fig. 4. At the end of the migration phase, Uranus’ eccentricity
and inclination are respectively within a factor of ∼ 2 and 1.25 of their current values. Neptune’s eccentricity and
inclination on the other hand are respectively within a factor of ∼ 1.6 and 1.7 of their current values. The ﬁnal periods
ratio of the two planets is almost identical to the measured value. We now calculate the secular frequencies amplitudes
of Neptune in our simulations and compare them to reality as suggested by Volk & Malhotra (2019). We hence use
linear secular theory as described in Murray & Dermott (1999). Neptune’s secular inclination evolution is controlled
by three modes: f6, f7, and f8. The frequencies of these modes to ﬁrst degree depend only on the semimajor axis
and planetary masses. Since we use the exact masses and match the ﬁnal semimajor axis very closely, we use the
same frequencies as today’s solar system with f6 = -25.73355 arcsec/yr, f7 = -2.90266 arcsec/yr, and f8 = -0.67752
arcsec/yr. The modes amplitudes are then obtained by ﬁtting the inclination’s equation of motion:

Our test particles disk is initiated with a semi-major axis distribution ∝ a−2 ranging from 22 to 48 AU, a Rayleigh

eccentricity distribution with a scale of 0.08, and a Rayleigh inclination distribution with a scale of 0.04 rad.

We start the simulation with a total of 8600 particles. Since the capture and retention probabilities in some TNOs

populations are very low, we use a particles cloning scheme to keep their number as high as possible.

At regular intervals (103 yr during Neptune’s migration, then 104 yr afterwards) we stop the simulation and check
if the number of particles has decreased (thus particles either escaped the domain edge at 500 AU or collided with
a planet or the sun). In this case we then clone a random sample of the remaining particles, with the sample size
automatically calculated to bring the total back to the initial particles number (8600). We “thermalize” the particles
clones by adding a random perturbation with an order of 10−6 − 10−5 rad to the mean anomalies. This scheme ensures

that a suﬃcient number of particles will still be present at the end of the simulation, without the signiﬁcant numerical
cost of cloning the entire particles population at regular intervals. At the end of our nominal simulation, we found that
36% of the initial unique particles population is still represented in the data, with the remaining 64% being clones.
Even though the entire initial particles parameters space is still represented in the ﬁnal data, original particles starting
inside 35 AU represents a small fraction of the total remaining particles. To check the validity of our cloning approach,
we compare the resulting test particles dynamical distribution at the end of Neptune’s migration to another simulation
where we simply clone all of the remaining particles whenever any escape. We ﬁnd that the ﬁnal semimajor axis,
eccentricity, and inclination normalized distributions are all very similar in the two cases, as KS tests indicate a less
than 1% probability that the 2 samples are drawn from diﬀerent distributions.

Finally, to represent the particles’ colors, we save each particle’s initial semimajor axis, and then map it to a “color”
parameter in the data analysis phase. Particles with an initial semimajor axis inside the color transition line are
LR, and vice versa. Our model’s Rebound Simulation Archives are available upon request, and allow for an exact
reproduction of our entire simulations and results.

3.2. Numerical results

3.2.1. Simulated orbits vs observations

Before we can discuss the origins of the color-eccentricity correlation, we need to make sure that our simulated
Kuiper Belt reasonably reproduces observations in the space of orbital parameters. We hence use the OSSOS Survey
Simulator 2.0 (Petit et al. 2011, 2017; Bannister et al. 2016, 2018; Lawler et al. 2018) to bias our numerical data and
then compare it directly to the observed OSSOS sample. We model the absolute magnitudes of the simulated objects
by sampling the empirical two-slopes distribution found by Fraser et al. (2014).

In Figure 5 (top panels) we show the semimajor axis - eccentricity/inclination distribution of our nominal model
post observational biasing using the survey simulator, compared to the OSSOS data. In Figure 5 (bottom panels)
we compare the eccentricity and inclination cumulative distributions of our model and the OSSOS data. Both ﬁgures
show good agreement between our nominal model and observations. While our eccentricity distribution is slightly
more low-eccentricity heavy than observations, possibly due to our choice for the particles initial semimajor axis
distribution ∝ a−2, our inclination cumulative distribution matches observations well. Note that, during testing,
we found the slow migration timescale to be important in reproducing the inclination distribution, as proposed by

Nesvorn´y (2015b). . Performing 2-sample A-D test, we ﬁnd a 97.5% chance that the two samples are drawn from the
same parent distribution. We obtain similar value for the eccentricities distributions, but only if we exclude e < 0.05,
as this is where the diﬀerence between the two plotted cumulative curves originates. Our model however is clearly
imperfect, as for example it predicts signiﬁcantly more objects in the 2:1 MMR than observed. We note that this is
probably a consequence of using smooth migration combined with a shallow disk proﬁle. This might not be a problem
if for example disk proﬁle is steeper and Neptune’s migration is grainy.

It is important to emphasize that we are not aiming to reproduce individual populations of the Kuiper Belt (such as
the ratio of particles between speciﬁc resonances, or the abundance of trailing particles), but rather for a reasonable
global sketch. This is because the dataset we are trying to explain is not large enough to allow for statistically studying
individual populations. textbf Moreover, our model also does not aim to ﬁt the cold classical population precisely,
as for example we did not include a jump in Neptune’s semimajor axis during its migration, which was shown to be
important in preserving the “kernel” of the cold belt (Nesvorn´y 2015a).

3.2.2. Color distributions: transition line location and color ratios

The origins of the TNOs’ surface colors are still far from being understood. In this work we investigate the possibility
that the colors are primordial as is implied from observations (Fraser & Brown 2012), and thus set by the local physical-
chemical structure of the protoplanetary disk when the objects formed. We assume a priori that the objects colors
depend entirely on their formation location. There hence must be an abrupt chemical or physical “color transition line”
in the disk that separated the formation zones of the LR and VR subpopulations. Tracing back the exact location of
this transition line from the colors of TNOs is complicated by the fact that both the color transition line’s location and

the details of Neptune’s migration will aﬀect the mixing ratio of the two colors. Breaking this degeneracy necessitates
knowing in advance either the transition line location, and using it to constrain the dynamics, or the other way around.
As our results in section 3.2.1 reproduced reasonably well the maximum eccentricities and inclinations of the observed
dynamically excited objects, we will ﬁx our dynamical model and vary the color transition location. We emphasize
however that the solution we ﬁnd is probably not unique, and assuming other early dynamical models might lead to
diﬀerent results.

Since our observational sample is limited, we will only ﬁt the general aspects of the color distributions: mainly that

VR objects are predominantly limited to eccentricities and inclinations below ecc=0.42 and i=21 deg.

We constrain the location of the color transition line using two diﬀerent approaches. First, we incrementally move
the transition line while checking for a VR objects cutoﬀ in eccentricity-inclination space, to ﬁnd the transition location
that brings the cutoﬀ as close as possible to e=0.42 and inc=21 deg. In Fig. 6 we plot the eccentricity and inclination
frequency histograms for the VR particles in our nominal model, for three diﬀerent transition line locations (40, 42,
and 44 AU). Note that a color transition line at or beyond 44 AU is observationally excluded due to the VRness of
the classical cold belt objects. We nonetheless include it for comparison. When considering inclinations we exclude
particles with e > 0.42, and for eccentrities we exclude particles with inc > 21 deg. This allows us to independently
constrain the color transition line based on the two diﬀerent parameters, without cross-contamination, in a similar
way to how we have analyzed the orbit distributions of the observed colours sample.

Inspecting the eccentricity plots (bottom panels), we ﬁnd a change in the distribution’s slope (a “plateau”) around e
∼ 0.4 for all three transition line locations. Moving the line outwards only decreases the number of VR particles with
e > 0.4 (so VR SDOs), without changing the plateau value. Comparing the ratio of VR objects with eccentricities
higher and lower than 0.42 with observations is hence needed to constrain the location of the color transition line using
only eccentricity data. Unconstrained observational biases in our dataset preclude us from doing that comparison.
Hence transition lines beyond 40 AU are all consistent with the eccentricity observations, even though if we take the
data at face value then a transition line at or beyond 42 AU is preferred.

Inspecting the inclinations distributions (top panels), we ﬁnd that for a transition line at 42 AU there is a sharp cutoﬀ
in the distribution around 23 deg. This cutoﬀ moves toward higher inclination values then disappears for transition
lines below 42 AU. Moreover, while it also moves toward lower inclination values for transition lines beyond 42 AU,
we exclude such values as mentioned above. Therefore, we conclude that in our nominal model, the strong limits on
VR objects in e-inc space is best reproduced by a color transition line at ∼ 42 AU.

A complimentary line of evidence that we can possibly use to constrain the location of the primordial color transition
line is the LR-to-VR color ratio of objects, inside and outside of the Q4 quadrant. This method can be more objective
and precise than our ﬁrst method. It is however strongly plagued by the uncertainties in the observational biases of
the dataset, in addition to the limited number of objects outside of the Q4 quadrant.

While we will hence use the LR to VR ratios as rough guidelines, and emphasize that observationally these ratios are
biased (Marsset et al. 2019). This analysis hence serves as a proof of principle for future studies with more data and
fully characterized discovery biases, rather than a deﬁnitive result on its own. For the observed and simulated ratios
to be directly comparable, we ﬁrst pass the simulations through the OSSOS Survey Simulator, but use an albedo of
12% for the VR objects, and 6% for the LR objects (Lacerda et al. 2014). We use a diameters distribution based on
the Jupiter Trojans, following Nesvorn´y et al. (2020). This is redone for each value of the color transition line. We
additionally follow M2019 in cloning all particles 10 times and randomizing their positional angles before feeding them
to the Survey Simulator, to improve the statistics. Note while this introduces observational biases to the simulations, it
does not alleviate the biases in the M2019 data discussed above. Moreover, we also caution the reader that the OSSOS
survey simulator should ideally be used for surveys with a recorded pointing history and a characterised detection
eﬃciency. Not all objects in the M2019 dataset have this information available. As a consequence, using the survey
simulator to compare our simulated TNO population to the observed M2019 population has its limits. For instance,
some surveys like OSSOS were designed to sample speciﬁc dynamical populations of TNOs (mostly the Plutinos in the
case of OSSOS, see Fig. 1 of Bannister et al. (2018)). So, by using the survey simulator without knowing the survey
pointing history, one may artiﬁcially increase or decrease the number of simulated objects from a speciﬁc dynamical
population. If this population has a distinct color ratio compared to other dynamical groups, this will introduce a
color bias in the simulated population.

By gradually moving the transition line, we again ﬁnd a best ﬁt color transition line around 40-42 AU, with lines
inside of 40 AU leading to a LR to VR ratio that is possibly too small outside of the Q4 quadrant. Our results,

Eccentricity-color correlation

11

compared to observations, are plotted in Figs. 7 and 8, for the unbiased and biased models respectively. For our
nominal model (smooth migration for Neptune, and a planetesimals disk with Σ ∝ 1/r2) we choose a transition at 42
AU, and ﬁnd a LR/VR ratios of 0.27 and 2.0 inside and outside of Q4, respectively. This compares decently with the
observations if we take them at face value, where LR-to-VR ratios are 1.08±0.24 and 6.94±2.97 inside and outside of
Q4, respectively. The intervals are 1-sigma Poisson error bars. For a transition line at 40 AU, these factors increase to
respectively 0.18 and 0.63. For a transition at 35 AU, our model produces a VR-to-LR ratio 1 to 2 orders of magnitude
lower than observations. These two ﬁgures (7 and 8) however also reveal a shortcoming of our model: the lack of VR
objects in the 3:2 MMR. While the observational dataset contains ∼ 10 such objects, our model produces virtually
none. This issue is also found in the grainy migration and cold disk models discussed later. This can only be rectiﬁed
if the color transition line is at or inside of 38 AU, leading to a much larger number of red objects in the scattering
disk. This tension between the observed VR objects in the scattering disk and those in the 3:2 MMR is not trivial to
interpret theoretically, as a perfect model should be able to both populate the 3:2 MMR with almost an equal number
of VR and LR objects, while virtually not scattering any VR objects into e≥0.42, or capturing any in the higher order
MMRs.

We hence conclude that a color transition line at either 38 or 42 AU is partially consistent with current observations,
and that more modeling and data are needed to resolve this paradox. We hence choose a more conservative color
transition line at 42 AU for the rest of this paper, as any VR objects in this case will still be VR for more close-in
transition lines.

Note that when calculating the ratio inside Q4 for our simulations, we exclude objects with inclinations less than 5
deg to be consistent with the observational sample. If we include these objects, our LR-to-VR ratio inside Q4 decreases
to 0.41. This signiﬁcant change is due to cold classicals being almost entirely VR in our simulations, in agreement
with observations.

For a deeper understanding of these ratios we plot the ﬁnal eccentricity and inclination of our particles as a function
of their initial semimajor axis in Fig. 9. The maximum inclinations reached for objects shows a strong negative
correlation with their initial semimajor axis, as one would expect since particles initially closer to Neptune will get
more dynamically excited. This negative correlation naturally leads to a smaller number of high inclination VR objects
than LR objects. Note that here we also notice that the model allows for the formation of the cold belt in situ, as
particles starting beyond 42 AU are mostly undisturbed and maintain their initially low inclinations. However, as we
did not ﬁne-tune the model to reproduce the details of the cold classicals, we do not dive further into this population’s
properties in our simulations.

The maximum eccentricities of objects on the other hand shows a much weaker negative correlation with the initial

semimajor axis, being roughly constant across all initial semimajor axis.

A simple maximal eccentricity - initial semimajor axis correlation hence does not explain the paucity of high eccen-
tricity VR particles. Inspecting the eccentricities of particles beyond 42 AU however reveals a strong “cliﬀ” around 45
AU, inside of which VR objects are as eccentric as LR objects, but beyond it the high eccentricity part of the diagram
is mostly empty. This absence of high eccentricity particles is located between 45 and 48 AU. This can be possibly due
to a lack of sweeping MMRs in the area between 45 and 48 AU. In fact, only the 2:1 MMR passes through this area
during Neptune’s migration, as the 5:3 ends up at ∼ 42.3 AU and the 7:4 at ∼ 43.7 AU. The next signiﬁcant MMR,
the 5:2, starts at ∼ 47 AU before ending at 55.5 AU. As the 2nd and 3rd order MMRs have capture probabilities that
scale with eccentricity as e−1 and e−1/2 instead of the e−3/2 found for 1st order MMRs (Hahn & Malhotra 2005), these
might be more relevant to the formation of high eccentricity red objects than the 2:1 MMR.

Another possible interpretation for the sudden decrease in the maximal eccentricity of red particles around 45 AU
can be found in the results of Holman & Wisdom (1993) who simulated the eccentricity distribution of particles
as a function of their semimajor axis, and found a cliﬀ outside of 42 AU. This can be attributed to the f7, f8, g7,
and g8 secular modes found inside 42 AU, and sharply disappear beyond it (Knezevic et al. 1991). These modes can
signiﬁcantly contribute to the particle’s dynamical excitation, and their absence beyond 42 AU will lead to dynamically
cold populations, the most prominent of which is the classic cold belt. The 42 AU secular structure transition location
reported by Holman & Wisdom (1993); Knezevic et al. (1991) however is diﬀerent than the 45 AU transition found in
our simulations, but this can be attributed to the many diﬀerences in the models. This include for example Uranus
and Neptune’s migration, that was not included in the Holman & Wisdom (1993) models, sweeping the outer edge
of the g8 resonance through the area before stopping at 48 AU. Moreover, as the solar system’s secular architecture
is very sensitive to the initial conditions and exact evolution of the 4 giant planets (Volk & Malhotra 2019), even

particles with inclinations higher than 21 deg.

mild diﬀerences between models can lead to signiﬁcantly diﬀerent secular architectures. What gives some credence to
this interpretation is that, when considering the low inclination red objects in the bottom panels of Fig. 9, we can
notice that at 48 AU, the particles maximum eccentricity distribution is once again suddenly similar to that of the LR
particles, with maximal eccentricities rising up to 0.8. This is consistent with Holman & Wisdom (1993) and Knezevic
et al. (1991) who both reported a reemergence of the g8 mode at 48 AU. In this picture, the paucity of VR objects at
high eccentricities is due to the narrowness of the initial semimajor axis interval that can lead to such particles, as its
constrained by the LR-VR color transition line on one side, and the secular resonances cliﬀ on the other.

3.2.3. Color distributions: Individual populations

The previous section gave us a bird’s eye view for the origins of the color eccentricity and inclination correlations by
linking the maximal eccentricity and inclination distributions to the initial semimajor axis of the objects. However,
this does not tell us how, physically, these high eccentricity or inclination VR objects reach their orbits. In this section
we hence inspect the dynamical history of individual particles in our simulations. Our aim is mainly to understand
the origins of the VR objects in the predominantly LR high eccentricity or inclination populations.

We start by examining Fig. 10 showing the initial semimajor axis of all of the outside of the (Q4) VR particles (with
either high eccentricity or inclination). We notice that the initial location of VR particles have no strong correlation
with the ﬁnal position of the particle in the e-inc diagram.

First we examine the VR population with e>0.42 and inc<21 deg (Q1). High eccentricity TNOs usually result from
either a scattering event by Neptune or capture in a MMR, thus evolving directly from Q4 to Q1. Manually inspecting
these simulated objects reveals that they usually originate as objects captured during Neptune’s migration in second
and third order MMRs, mainly the 5:2, 5:3, 7:4, and 3:1 resonances. These are then long term stable inside or near the
MMRs, sometimes up to a 109 years, before eventually undergoing a scattering event that put them on their current
orbit. The delayed scattering is probably due to the slow and stochastic diﬀusion of particles inside the MMRs, slowly
pushing them out into Neptune crossing orbits. Three representative examples are shown in Fig. 11. The ﬁrst case
shows a particle originating around 42.5 AU, then getting captured by a migrating Neptune in the 5:2 MMR as evident
through its smooth semimajor axis and eccentricity increase, and the libration of 5λp -2λN -3(cid:36)p resonant angle, where
λ and (cid:36) are respectively the mean longitude and longitude of perihelion. Once Neptune’s migration has ended, the
particle remains captured for ∼ 0.5 Gyr, before getting scattered by Neptune into an orbit with a ∼ 95 AU and e ∼

0.6. The inclination of this object is never above ∼ 15 deg. In the second example we show a case where the object
is captured in the 7:4 MMR for 2 Gyr, before exiting the resonance, encountering Neptune, and getting scattered to
55 AU , e ∼ 0.43, and an inclination of 10 deg. In the ﬁnal example, the objects is captured into the 3:1 MMR, and
remains stable in the resonance for the lifetime of the solar system with e ∼ 0.41 and inc ∼ 3 deg. It is worth noting
however that the 3λp -λN -2(cid:36)p angle librates only for the ﬁrst 3×108 yr, before starting to circulate. This indicates
that the particle might be on a stable orbit near, but not necessarily strictly inside, the MMR.

Next we examine the population of VR objects with e<0.42 and inc>21 deg (Q3). The fundamental mechanism
behind this population is Kozai-Lidov oscillations inside MMRs (Kozai 1962; Lidov 1962; Morbidelli et al. 1995;
Thomas & Morbidelli 1996; Morbidelli 1997), usually the same second and third order resonances seen above. In the
ﬁrst example, we show a particle getting swept by Neptune’s 5:2 MMR during its migration, increasing its eccentricity
at constant low inclination, before the Kozai-Lidov resonance is triggered as reﬂected by the libration of the argument
of the pericenter around the two stable modes at 90o and 270o (Wan & Huang 2007). The particle’s eccentricity and
inclination then start to oscillate inversely, periodically increasing the inclination while decreasing the eccentricity,

Figure 9. Top panels: the ﬁnal eccentricities and inclinations for all of our simulated particles as a function of their initial
semimajor axis. The blue box on the right panel delimits a zone with a paucity of high eccentricity VR objects, probably due
to the g7, g8, f8, and f8 secular resonances. Bottom panels: same as above, but limiting the inclinations plot to eccentricities

leading eventually to the particle escaping the resonance during a high inclination phase. This mechanism was initially
proposed by Gomes (2003); Gomes et al. (2005). The particle ﬁnally ends up with e ∼ 0.15 and inc ∼ 23 deg.
The second example we show follows the same steps, except the particle is caught in the 3:1 MMR, and has higher
eccentricity when the Kozai-Lidov oscillations are triggered. This leads ﬁnally to e ∼ 0.15 and inc ∼ 28 deg. We note
that in both examples we show the particles never undergo a close encounter, and thus their semimajor axis evolution
is smooth, with the particles ﬁnishing the simulation on near-MMR orbits. While this behavior is common for the
particles in this regime, it is not exclusive. However, if indeed kozai-Lidov oscillations without scattering create this
population, then we predict that the binary fraction of these objects should also be higher than for Q1/Q2 where
scattering oﬀ Neptune is more common.

Some of the particles in our simulation do undergo scattering events, and sometimes even MMR hopping. However
the Kozai-Lidov oscillations are present in the majority of cases. We also note that the majority of particles in this
category have inclinations relatively close to the 21 deg limit, usually less than 28 deg.

We ﬁnally examine the population of VR objects with e>0.42 and inc>21 deg (Q2) illustrated through our ﬁnal
example in Fig. 11. Multiple possible mechanisms contribute to this population. The simplest and most common,
shown in our ﬁrst example, starts with an inward scattering event that both increases the eccentricity of the particle,
and allows it to cross the f7 and f8 secular resonances between 38 and 42 AU (reﬂected through the libration of the
longitude of the ascending nodes Ωp - ΩN ), signiﬁcantly increasing its inclination. The particle is ﬁnally scattered
again, but outwards to its ﬁnal orbit. Multiple variations of this mechanism exist, including scattering from inside a
MMR after slow diﬀusion, and Kozai-Lidov oscillations bumping up the particle’s inclination moderately before the
scattering event and the secular resonance crossing. Since our color transition line is at 42 AU, and all major secular
resonances capable of inclination excitation are interior to it, then only particles scattered inward can cross these
resonances. The scattering naturally increases the particle’s eccentricity, leading to the strong correlation between
very high inclination (inc > 28 deg) and high eccentricity VR particles.

We summarize the three mechanisms responsible for red high eccentricity or inclinations objects in Fig. 12.

Figure 10. Normalized cumulative frequency distribution of the initial semimajor axis for the dynamically excited (Q1, Q2,
and Q3) VR particles at the end of our nominal simulation. As we set our color transition line to 42 AU, this is the minimum
value in the diagram. We see that all three subpopulations have similar initial location distributions even though, as argued in
section 3.2.3, they evolve into their characteristic orbits via diﬀerent mechanisms.

Our nominal model in the previous section assumed smooth planetary migration. In this section we investigate the
eﬀects of granular migration for Neptune. In the models of Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y (2016); Kaib & Sheppard (2016),
granular migration signiﬁcantly increases the number of particles that fall out of mean motion resonances. We add
granularity to our nominal model using a simple prescription based on that of Kaib & Sheppard (2016), who used a
parametric ﬁt to the N-body results of Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y (2016).

We create a distribution of roughly 20,000 positional jumps amplitudes δx [AU] by sampling the following Gaussian:

f (∆a) =

√

1
2σ2π

exp −

(∆a − µ)2
2σ2

(4)

where µ = ±3.75 × 10−4au and σ = 1.8 × 10−3au. Notice that the Gaussian mean is a factor ∼ 6 less than the value
used by Kaib & Sheppard (2016), since we ﬁnd that higher values lead to very high dynamical noise and chaotic
evolution for Neptune, signiﬁcantly more than in Kaib & Sheppard (2016). This is probably due to the diﬀerent
integrators used. We moreover set a maximum amplitude of ± 7.5 ×10−4 AU. We generate the jumps encounter times
similarly to Kaib & Sheppard (2016) by assuming that they are uniformly distributed until t=τm/10, and then they
fall oﬀ as t−1.15 until t=3τm. We ﬁnally apply the jumps to Neptune’s cartesian coordinate component x as:

Neptune.x = Neptune.x + δx

(5)

This contrasts with Kaib & Sheppard (2016) who applied the jumps to the semimajor axis directly. The main
reason for using the cartesian coordinates is because, in Rebound, orbital elements such as the semimajor axis are
protected attributes for the class member, and hence we cannot change them directly during a simulation from
within Python API. An alternative would be to create a Reboundx operator (instead of a force) that can directly
act on the semimajor axis. The issue with this approach is that the optimal integrator for our setup (Mercurius) is
incompatible with Reboundx operators. We hence choose to apply our jumps to Neptune.x directly, while turning on
the whfast.safe mode ﬂag, turning oﬀ the symplectic correctors, and making sure that the particles’ positions and
velocities are synchronized. Comparison of our smooth and granular models is shown in the top panels Fig. 13. While
Neptune’s two semimajor axis evolution curves are practically identical on large (AU) scale, the grainy migration curve
is signiﬁcantly more jittery at the 0.01 AU scale. We note that due to these jumps, the giant planets evolution here
is not bit by bit identical to the smooth case. While we start the system with the exact same initial conditions, and
the ﬁnal semimajor axis, inclinations, and Uranus’ eccentricity are very close to the smooth migration case, Neptune’s
ﬁnal eccentricity is a factor ∼ 2 higher.

Figure 12. A summary of the mechanisms responsible for red objects on high eccentricity or inclination orbits. Quadrant Q1
objects with high eccentricity but low inclination are initially captured in second and third order MMRs, before escaping the
resonance and getting scattered outward by Neptune. Quadrant Q3 red objects with high inclination but low eccentricity start as
either Q4 or Q1 objects, before undergoing Kozai-Lidov oscillations (usually inside the MMRs) that lift their inclinations while
decreasing their eccentricities. Finally, Q2 objects with both high eccentricity and inclination also start by getting captured in
a MMR, but then undergo an inward scattering by Neptune, allowing them to cross the f7 and f8 secular resonances, raising
their inclination. They are ﬁnally rescattered outwards to their ﬁnal orbits.

In the bottom panels of Fig. 13 we compare the ﬁnal test particles eccentricity and inclination distributions for
both models. We ﬁnd that grainy migration, in the limits of our implementation, leads to a factor ∼ 1.5 more high
eccentricity (e> 0.22) and inclination (inc > 8) particles than smooth migration, while equally decreasing the fraction
of dynamically colder particles. Inspecting the LR to VR particles number ratio, assuming our nominal color transition
line at 42 AU, we ﬁnd 0.29 and 1.91 respectively for inside and outside of Q4. These numbers are practically identical
to those obtained in the smooth migration case (0.27 and 2.0), indicating that the extra dynamically hot particles
obtained here preserve the color ratios.

In Fig. 14 we plot the VR particles eccentricity and inclination normalized frequency distributions for our granular
model, compared to the nominal case, considering three diﬀerent color transition lines. We notice that grainy migration
leads to more VR high inclination or eccentricity particles in almost all cases, and while it does seem to slightly push the
high inclination cliﬀ outwards into the cold classical belt, it does not aﬀect the location of the eccentricity distribution
plateau.

We hence conclude that the granularity of Neptune’s migration has little eﬀects on our results, considering the
sparsity of the observational data. We however emphasize that: 1- higher levels of granularity might change our

3.4. Eﬀects of the disk’s initial eccentricity and inclination

Our choice to initiate the simulation with a moderately stirred-up proto-Kuiper belt is motivated by many studies
showing possible primordial TNOs disk excitation due to the earlier dynamical history of the 4 gas giants (Chiang et
al. 2003; Tsiganis et al. 2005; Hahn & Malhotra 2005). These studies moreover showed that, as initially discussed by
Dermott et al. (1988), dynamically hot particles have a higher probability of being captured into Neptune’s higher
order MMRs, such as 3:1 and 5:2, during its migration.

To investigate the eﬀects of starting with a dynamically colder disk, we ran an otherwise identical set of simulations
where we sample the particles disk from a Rayleigh eccentricity distribution with a scale of 0.04, and a Rayleigh
inclination distribution with a scale of 0.02 rad, both a factor 2 below our nominal model. Comparisons of the ﬁnal
eccentricity and inclination distributions of VR particles exclusively are also plotted in Fig. 13. This show signiﬁcantly
more particles with e < 0.05 and inc < 2.5 deg for the cold case, while the nominal case has more particles in the
moderately excited range (e ∼ 0.12 and inc ∼ 5 deg). The cold case also seems to have less particles on very hot orbits,
but the statistic is too low for a deﬁnitive conclusion in this regard. We ﬁnally compare the LR to VR ratios between
the two cases, and ﬁnd values of 3.77 and 0.27 for outside and inside Q4, respectively. The cold disk case therefore
leads to the same LR-to-red ratio inside Q4 as the nominal case, but for more VR particles outside of it.

In Fig. 14 we plot the VR particles eccentricity and inclination normalized frequency distributions for our cold
model, compared to the grainy and nominal cases, considering three diﬀerent color transition lines. We notice that
the cold model have the same inclination cliﬀ and eccentricity plateau location as the hotter model, and therefore is
consistent with the same color transition location derived from our nominal case.

3.5. Eﬀects of the disk’s initial surface density proﬁle

Eccentricity-color correlation

21

The ﬁnal parameter we explore is the initial surface density proﬁle of the planetesimals disks. In our nominal model
above we used Σ ∝ r−2 as it reproduces reasonably well many aspects of the dynamical and color structures of the
Kuiper belt. This proﬁle however suﬀers from two possible issues:

• it might not be consistent with the mass of the cold classical belt, as it implies that the ratio between the mass
available at 30 and 45 AU is only 1.5. Assuming a mass of 3 × 10−4M⊕ for the cold classicals at 45 AU (Fraser
et al. 2014) (or ∼ 10−4M⊕ / AU), this imply a mass at 30 AU ∼ 10−4M⊕ / AU. This is orders of magnitude
less than the ∼ 1M⊕ / AU at 30 AU needed for Neptune’s migration (Nesvorn´y & Morbidelli 2012). If indeed
Σ ∝ r−2, this would mean that either the currently observed mass of cold classicals does not constrain the mass
initially available around 45 AU, or that cold classicals were depleted by 4 orders of magnitude. Note that an
alternative possibility is a heavy disk that ends at 42 AU, with a cold belt implemented later via the mechanism
of Gomes (2020).

• our conclusion that color transition lines below 38 AU produces too many VR objects to be consistent with
observations might be surface density proﬁle dependent. Other disk proﬁles, with less mass available around
30-38 AU, can possibly allow us to relax this constraint.

We will hence investigate the eﬀects of using diﬀerent initial surface density proﬁles. As running full simulations for
each case is numerical prohibitive, we will follow Nesvorn´y et al. (2020) in using a weighting scheme with our nominal
model to mimic a diﬀerent initial disk proﬁle. We hence assign each object a weight w(r) that follows the selected
surface density proﬁle. The weights for the nominal (1/r2) model particles are wnom(r) = 1 everywhere, and hence each
particle is only counted once in this case. For the weighted cases, each particle is counted Cw × wnom(r) × r2 Σnew(r)
times, where Cw is a normalization constant. For surface density proﬁles steeper than our nominal case, w(r) will be
> 1 at small semimajor axis, and < 1 in the outer disk. Note that this method in principle is inapplicable to particles
starting inside 30 AU, as their history is highly coupled to Neptune’s migration. Since our LR-VR transition line is
never inside 35 AU, this method should be reasonably accurate when studying the VR objects.

surface density proﬁles: Σ(r) =
r exp [−(r − 22)/2.5], a truncated power law with Σ ∝ 1/rγ with γ=1.4 inside 30 AU, and γ=1 outside of it, with a
scaling factor of 1000 at 30 AU, and ﬁnally a hybrid case with a power law inside 30 AU, and exponential decrease
outside. We also add an additional case with Σ(r) = 1
r exp [−(r − 22)/4.5], that while still underpredict the cold
classicals mass, we ﬁnd it to be an interesting case that leads to smaller ratios than the Σ(r) ∝ exp [−r/2.5] case.

in exploring three diﬀerent

(2020)

We ﬁrst start by investigating the possible presence and location of eccentricity and inclination cutoﬀs for VR objects,
as this is the most robust method to compare the models to the observations. In Fig. 15 we plot the ﬁnal eccentricity
and inclination normalized frequency distributions of VR objects for the 4 weighted initial proﬁles, and for 4 diﬀerent
color transition line locations. We ﬁrst notice that the 4 curves are partially correlated, which is a consequence of
using a weighting scheme. Looking closer, we notice that while none of the curves show an inclination cutoﬀ at 21 deg
for transitions at 35 or 40 AU, all 4 show a cutoﬀ to a certain extent for a transition at 42 AU. For the eccentricity,
we notice that all cases also show a plateau for transitions at 40 and 42 AU. All in all, while the 4 proﬁles do lead to
seemingly diﬀerent distributions, none of them necessitate a color transition location diﬀerent than our nominal model
(40 to 42 AU).

As our previous analysis showed no signiﬁcant eﬀects for using diﬀerent initial surface density proﬁles on the VR
particles e-inc cutoﬀ, We now follow up our by calculating the VR-to-LR ratio inside and outside of e = 0.42 and inc =
21 deg for the diﬀerent proﬁles, and inspecting VR objects inside the 3:2 MMR. As discussed for the nominal case, we
reemphasise that these numbers should be interpreted very loosely, as all of the observed ratios are biased and might
not be reﬂective of the intrinsic values even after correcting for the diﬀerent albedos and other eﬀects. They however
do oﬀer valuable informations when comparing the diﬀerent models together. Note that to obtain the reported ratios,
the weighting was done on the biased population obtained through the Survey Simulator, as for our nominal model.
The ﬁnal ratios for the diﬀerent proﬁles are summarized in table 3. We report the LR-to-VR ratios inside and outside
of ecc = 0.42 and inc = 21 deg. Our results show that, overall, the two exponential proﬁles with color transition at 35
AU leads to closer ratios compared to observations than the nominal case, with the added advantage over a 40-42 AU
color transition of populating the 3:2 MMR with VR particles. The exp(−r/2.5) case however also lead to a factor
5-10 less VR particles in this resonance than the nominal and exp(−r/4.5) cases, for the same transition location.
If the ratio observed by M2019 in the 3:2 is any reﬂective of the intrinsic value the exp(−r/2.5) case would not be
a good solution, even excluding that it does not ﬁt the eccentricity-inclination cutoﬀ. The acceptable color ratios

color transition locations. Plotted are 4 diﬀerent proﬁles: 2 exponential proﬁles with diﬀerent e-folding distances, a truncated
power laws case, and a hybrid case.

for these proﬁles with transitions at 35 AU, combined with our results in Fig. 15 showing that such transition does
not reproduce sharp e-inc cutoﬀs in the VR population, imply that the exponential proﬁles are leading to a smooth
decline in the VR population as a function of the eccentricity and inclination. While the exponential proﬁles might be
consistent with the observed color ratios in SDOs and plutinos, they are not consistent with the sharp constrains on
VR objects to inside e=0.42 and inc=21 deg.

Inspecting the truncated power law proﬁle case, we ﬁnd that it always leads to ratios inside and outside the ecc-inc
cutoﬀ that are much closer than the other cases. Finally, the hybrid case always leads to ratios much higher than the
other cases, sometimes by an order of magnitude.

From all of these 3 lines of evidences, we conclude that using diﬀerent initial surface density proﬁles does not seem to
eliminate the tension between the rarity of VR SDOs, the abundance of VR objects in the 3:2 MMR, and possibly the
color ratios contrast inside and outside of ecc = 0.42 and inc = 21 deg. Assuming that full simulations with diﬀerent
initial surface density proﬁles behave similarly to our weighted proﬁles, and that the unbiased color ratios are inline
with our dataset’s values, this hints that a more complex migration history for Neptune than assumed here might be
needed to solve this contradiction.

4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

4.1. Summary

1. By reanalyzing the dataset of Marsset et al. (2019) that includes data from Col-OSSOS and other surveys, we
show that VR TNOs are strongly limited to eccentricities less than ∼ 0.42. This result, taken together with the
color-inclination correlation of Marsset et al. (2019), implies that VR TNOs are constrained in e-inc space to
inside e=0.42, and inc = 21 deg.

2. Inspecting the individual populations in the dataset, we show that the color-eccentricity and color-inclination
correlations are created by diﬀerent bodies, with the dominant LR colors of SDOs and high order MMRs creating
the ﬁrst, and multiple diﬀerent populations contributing to the second. We however ﬁnd that the 3:2 MMR
contains both LR and VR objects in signiﬁcant amounts.

3. Using N-body simulations accounting for Uranus and Neptune’s migration, we show that the data is best ex-
plained through a primordial color transition line around 38-42 AU in the protoplanetary disk, with LR and
VR objects forming inside and outside of it, respectively. This is consistent with the results of Nesvorn´y et al.

Table 3. The LR-to-VR objects ratio inside and outside of the ecc = 0.42 and inc = 21 deg constrain for diﬀerent initial surface
density proﬁles and color transition line locations.

(2020) who hypothesized a roughly similar color transition line to explain the results of Marsset et al. (2019).
Our nominal model leads to LR-to-red objects ratio of 0.27 and 2.0 inside and outside of e=0.42 and inc = 21
deg, respectively. This is a factor ∼ 3 within the observational values where LR-to-VR ratios are ∼ 1.04 and
5.84.

4. We however ﬁnd a possible tension between the rarity of the VR objects in the scattered disk, and their abundance
in the 3:2 MMR, as a color transition line inside 38 AU is needed to explain the latter, but this also leads to a
large number of VR objects in the scattering disk. This tension is not alleviated when using diﬀerent disk initial
surface density proﬁles, although this was investigated using weighted proﬁles instead of full simulations.

5. We additionally ﬁnd that adding modest graininess to the migration does not change the LR-to-VR ratios of our

nominal model, as both VR and LR particles are equally aﬀected by this graininess.

6. We ﬁnally investigate the origins of the VR objects outside of the e=0.42 and inc = 21 deg quadrant, and ﬁnd
three distinct mechanisms behind these objects in the three diﬀerent parts of phase space. • VR objects with
e > 0.42 and inc < 21 deg usually start as particles trapped in second and third order MMRs for 108-109 yr,
before exiting the resonance, and getting scattered into higher eccentricity orbits by Neptune. • VR objects with
e < 0.42 and inc > 21 deg also start as particles trapped in the same MMRs, but then undergo Kozai-Lidov
oscillations inside the resonances, raising their inclination while lowering their eccentricity. This allows them
to escape the MMR and remain on the high inclination, low eccentricty orbits. • VR objects with e > 0.42
and inc > 21 deg yet again start as particles trapped in MMRs, including the same second and third order
resonances, but also the 2:1 MMR. These objects eventually escape the resonance, and get scattered inwards by
Neptune, thus crossing the f7, f8, g7, and g8 secular resonances. The scattering itself raises their eccentricity,
while the secular resonances crossing increases their inclination dramatically, putting them on high eccentricty
and inclination orbits.

4.2. Discussions

1. While we hope that our results will contribute to understanding the early evolution of the solar system, this
approach can beneﬁt greatly from both more data and simulations. For example, the limited scope and size
of the M2019 dataset did not allow us to inspect the precise LR-to-red ratios in the 4 individual e-inc space
quadrants (Fig. 3), or in individual MMRs.

24

Ali-Dib et al.

2. The numerical model we uses in this work can moreover be improved. While we did check smooth and granular
migration, in addition to cold and hotter initial TNOs disks, we tried only a single migration timescale value.
We moreover did not inspect migration schemes with “jumping Neptune” (Nesvorn´y 2015a), or short range
transport (Gomes 2020). We moreover fully simulated a single particles number density distribution, while other
distributions (exponential, truncated power law) were mimicked via a weighting scheme. Exploring these models
with full simulations might shed more light the tension between the abundance of VR objects in the 3:2 MMR,
and their absence in the scattered disk.

3. In our granular model, we used signiﬁcantly lower jump mean amplitude than Kaib & Sheppard (2016), as
higher values led to a chaotic evolution for Neptune. While this can simply be due to the diﬀerent codes (and
algorithms) used by the two groups, fully understanding the origins of this discrepancy is of interest for future
works.

4. The disk physical-chemistry interpretation of the color transition line at ∼ 38-42 AU is also an open question.
The simplest such transition imaginable would be the outermost snowlines (CO or N2).
It is however hard
to push any of these this far out without a very shallow temperature proﬁle, where CO snowlines are usually
observed to be inside 30 AU (Schwarz et al. 2016), although larger values are also possible (Qi et al. 2019). Other
possibilities are the NH3 or H2S retention lines as proposed by (Brown et al. 2011). Further constraining the
location of the color transition line using TNOs color observations can hence shed light on the physical-chemical
structure of the protoplanetary disk.
