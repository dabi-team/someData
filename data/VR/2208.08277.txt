Abstract—Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) is often
called a “killer” application of 5G systems because it imposes
very strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements related to
throughput, latency, and reliability. A high-resolution AR/VR
ﬂow requires a bandwidth of dozens of MHz. Since the existing
low-frequency bands (i.e., below 6 GHz) have limited bandwidth
and are overpopulated, one of the ways to satisfy high AR/VR
demands is to use wide frequency channels available in the
millimeter-Wave (mmWave) band. However, transmission in
the mmWave band suffers from high throughput ﬂuctuation
and even blockage, which leads to violation of strict AR/VR
latency and reliability requirements. To address this problem,
5G speciﬁcations introduce a Multi-Connectivity (MC) feature
that allows a mobile user to connect simultaneously to several
base stations. The paper considers a scenario with two base
stations: the ﬁrst base station operates in the low-frequency band
to provide reliable data delivery, while the second one operates in
the mmWave band and offers high data rates when the channel
conditions are favorable. An open question that falls out of the
scope of speciﬁcations is how to balance AR/VR trafﬁc between
two links with different characteristics. The paper proposes a
Delay-Based Trafﬁc Balancing (DBTB) algorithm that minimizes
resource consumption of the low-frequency link while satisfying
strict AR/VR QoS requirements. With extensive simulations,
DBTB is shown to double the network capacity for AR/VR trafﬁc
compared with the state-of-the-art trafﬁc balancing algorithms.

I. INTRODUCTION

Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) are rapidly evolv-
ing technologies that established a market of $209B in
2022 [1]. AR/VR is used in various areas, such as gaming
and entertainment, education, medicine, driving and aviation
training, etc. AR/VR applications generate a high-resolution
video stream that is played back on an AR/VR headset. To
reduce the complexity and the power consumption of AR/VR
headsets, a Cloud AR/VR technology has been proposed [2].
With this technology, an AR/VR video stream is generated
and encoded with popular video codecs (e.g., H.265 [3]) on a
high-performance remote server located on the Internet. The
video stream is then transmitted to an AR/VR headset that
renders and plays back the obtained video [4].

Typically, an AR/VR headset is connected to a network
these

with a wired or a Wi-Fi connection [2]. However,

options greatly limit user mobility as they offer local area
coverage (e.g., a room in an apartment). One of the ways
to provide more “freedom” to the AR/VR user is to use
cellular systems. Note that AR/VR trafﬁc imposes very strict
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements regarding throughput,
latency, and frame loss rate. For example, as shown in [2],
a 4K AR/VR stream requires a throughput above 60 Mbps,
a packet delivery time below 15 ms, and a video frame
loss ratio below 1%. Existing 4G systems cannot satisfy
such requirements because their very rigid design [5] results
in signiﬁcant data transmission delays exceeding 20 ms in
commercial networks [6].

5G systems can provide much higher capacity by using
wide channels available at high frequencies. Speciﬁcally, the
5G New Radio (NR) technology is designed to operate at two
Frequency Ranges (FRs): (i) FR1 contains frequencies below
6 GHz, which are traditionally used in cellular systems, (ii)
FR2 contains frequencies from 24 to 53 GHz and is called
the mmWave range. The base station (gNB) operating in
FR2 can use channels as wide as 1 GHz and, thus, provide
multi-Gbps data rates. Several papers study the feasibility of
using mmWave links for AR/VR trafﬁc delivery [7]–[9]. They
show that the mmWave link suffers from high throughput
ﬂuctuation and link blockage, which leads to a violation of
strict AR/VR latency and reliability requirements.

To improve reliability, the NR speciﬁcations of Release 16

introduce the Multi-Connectivity (MC) feature, which allows
a User Equipment (UE) to connect to several gNBs. In this
paper, we consider the case when a UE connects to two gNBs
called Master gNB (MgNB) and Secondary gNB (SgNB),
see Fig. 1. The MgNB operates in FR1 and, thus, provides
high coverage and reliability. The SgNB operates in FR2
and provides high data rates when channel conditions are
favorable. When channel conditions deteriorate (e.g., because
of a high probability of mmWave signal blockage), the data
rate can be even lower than in FR1 [10] and no link adaptation
algorithms such as [11] can improve the situation. In such a
case, the UE should use the FR1 link for data transmission.
With MC, downlink trafﬁc arrives at the MgNB, which serves
as a coordinator. For each packet, the MgNB decides whether
to send it via the FR1 link, via the FR2 link, or via both links
for better reliability. Thus, an open research question left out
of the scope of 5G speciﬁcations is how to balance the trafﬁc
to utilize several wireless links efﬁciently.

Most of the existing papers consider the problem of bal-
ancing enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) trafﬁc. The al-
gorithms proposed in these papers aim at maximizing the total
throughput [12]–[16]. In this paper, we show that these algo-
rithms cannot be applied to AR/VR trafﬁc because they do not
take into account strict latency and reliability requirements.
Consequently, we propose a Delay-Based Trafﬁc Balancing
(DBTB) algorithm that minimizes resource consumption of
the low-frequency link (i.e., the FR1 link) while satisfying
strict AR/VR QoS requirements. With extensive simulations
in NS-3, we show that DBTB doubles the network capacity
for AR/VR trafﬁc compared with the state-of-the-art trafﬁc
balancing algorithms.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we review the existing trafﬁc balancing algorithms designed
for 5G systems with the MC feature. Section III provides the
problem statement. In Section IV, we describe the proposed
algorithm. In Section V, we compare the performance of
the proposed and the existing algorithms in scenarios with
AR/VR trafﬁc. Section VI concludes the paper.

II. EXISTING ALGORITHMS

Consider a scenario with a UE connected to two gNBs:
an MgNB operating in FR1, and an SgNB operating in FR2.
Figure 2 shows the protocol stack of the gNBs and the UE.
With MC, the downlink trafﬁc arrives at the Packet Data
Convergence Protocol (PDCP) located at the MgNB. With
each data packet called Service Data Unit (SDU), PDCP
makes the following changes: it (i) compresses upper-layer
(e.g., IP/UDP) headers, (ii) chippers data, (iii) adds a PDCP
header which contains a unique sequence number. An SDU
with the appended header is called Protocol Data Unit (PDU).
With each PDCP PDU, the MgNB determines whether to
send it (i) via the local protocol stack (i.e., via the FR1 link),
(ii) via the SgNB stack (via the FR2 link) by using the Xn
interface, or (iii) via both links. The latter case is called Packet
Duplication (PD). When it is used, several copies of the same

Figure 2: NR protocol stack for a UE connected to two gNBs.

PDCP PDU may arrive at the UE. To remove duplicates and
provide in-sequence packet delivery, the UE uses sequence
numbers in the PDCP header [17].

The algorithm used by PDCP to balance the trafﬁc between
various links is not speciﬁed in 5G standards and shall be de-
ﬁned by vendors. Below we describe the existing algorithms.

A. Link Switching

With Link Switching, the MgNB uses one link at a time.
To select a link for data transmission, the MgNB uses one
or several metrics to choose the best link. The widely used
metrics are as follows.

∙ Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) or Signal
Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) [12], [13]. These
metrics are updated at the MgNB and the SgNB based
on periodic channel measurements.

∙ Expected data rate [16] that can be estimated, e.g., based
on the Shannon equation: 𝐶 = 𝐵 log2 (1 + 𝑆𝐼𝑁 𝑅),
where 𝐵 is the bandwidth of the considered link.
If the link quality signiﬁcantly changes with time,
the
packets already being transmitted via the link may be lost,
which is crucial for AR/VR applications.

B. Packet Duplication

With Packet Duplication (PD), all data packets are du-
plicated at PDCP and sent via both links. This approach
allows achieving high reliability [9], [13], [18]. However, it
signiﬁcantly increases channel resource consumption, which
is critical for the FR1 link because it has much lower
bandwidth than the FR2 link.

C. Packet Splitting

With Packet Splitting (PS), both links are used but pack-
ets are distributed between the links without duplication.
In this paper, we consider a variant of the PS algorithm
which provides the fractions of packets sent via each link
proportionally to the capacities of the links [19]. Assuming

that the link capacities do not vary signiﬁcantly with time,
this approach allows delivering a chunk of data (e.g., a video
frame) with minimal time. However, as we show in Section V,
this assumption does not hold for FR2 links, which leads to
violation of the video frame delay budget in some cases.

III. PROBLEM STATEMENT

In the paper, we consider the following scenario. An
AR/VR application periodically generates video frames. Each
video frame is divided into several packets that are sent to the
cellular network. The network shall transmit all the packets of
a video frame within a given delay budget denoted as 𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆.
As mentioned in Section I, 𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆 is of the order of a dozen
of milliseconds. If at least one packet of a video frame is not
delivered within 𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆, the whole video frame is considered
to be lost. To provide high quality for the AR/VR video at
the UE, the fraction of lost video frames shall not exceed
𝐹 𝐿𝑅𝑄𝑜𝑆, which is of the order of 10−2. Such a low value
means that almost all video frames shall be delivered in time.
The trafﬁc of the AR/VR application can be delivered to
the UE via two links (i.e., the FR1 link and the FR2 link).
The SgNB operating in FR2 provides high data rates and,
thus, can quickly deliver a large portion of data. However,
because of speciﬁc propagation properties, the data rate can
signiﬁcantly vary with time and even drop to zero. Thus, a
video frame may not be delivered within 𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆. In contrast,
the MgNB operating in FR1 provides stable but lower data
rates.

Our goal is to design an algorithm that delivers video
frames within the given delay budget 𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆 with the minimal
resource consumption of the FR1 link.

MgNB should start
its transmission). If the MgNB does
not receive an acknowledgment for the PDCP PDU before
time 𝑇𝑛 (Step 1.7), it forwards this PDCP PDU to the RLC
layer for further transmission (Step 1.8) and deletes it from
QUEUE#𝑖 (Step 1.6).

Transmission times 𝑇𝑛 in QUEUE#𝑖 are calculated as
follows (Step 1.4). For a newly arrived PDCP PDU (𝑛 + 1):

𝑇𝑛+1 = 𝑇𝑛𝑜𝑤 + (𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆 − 𝐷𝑅𝑒𝑇 𝑋 ) − 𝑠𝑛+1/𝐶,

(1)

where 𝑇𝑛𝑜𝑤 is the current time, 𝑠𝑛+1 is the size of the PDCP
PDU (𝑛 + 1), 𝐶 is the estimation of the FR1 link data rate,
and 𝐷𝑅𝑒𝑇 𝑋 is the time needed to make one retransmission.
The protocol stack at the MgNB is conﬁgured to provide
transmission reliability of 90% (i.e., a packet is lost with
0.1 probability after a single transmission attempt). Thus, to
provide data loss lower than 𝐹 𝐿𝑅𝑄𝑜𝑆, for some PDCP PDUs
retransmission will be required, which should be taken into
account in the overall delay budget. Since the addition of a
new PDCP PDU increases the time needed to transmit data
from QUEUE#𝑖, the MgNB recalculates the transmission
times of other PDCP PDU recursively (from tail to head of
the queue):

𝑇 𝑛𝑒𝑤
𝑛 = min(𝑇𝑛, 𝑇𝑛+1 − 𝑠𝑛/𝐶).

(2)

In the case of successful transmission of a PDCP PDU via
the SgNB, the SgNB sends an acknowledgment containing
the corresponding PDCP sequence number to the MgNB (Step
1.5). This PDCP PDU is removed from QUEUE#𝑖 (Step 1.6).
Since the number of PDCP PDUs in QUEUE#𝑖 has changed,
the MgNB can optionally recalculate transmission times for
the remaining PDCP PDUs (Step 1.4).

IV. PROPOSED ALGORITHM

B. Actions at the SgNB

This section presents the designed algorithm called Delay-
Based Trafﬁc Balancing (DBTB). The idea behind the DBTB
algorithm is as follows. Initially, the algorithm tries to transmit
data over the fast FR2 link. Then, if an estimation of the
delivery time via the MgNB for some packets exceeds 𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆,
these packets are transmitted over the reliable FR1 link. So,
the proposed algorithm always uses the fast FR2 link while
the reliable FR1 link is left only for “emergency” cases, i.e.,
when packets cannot be delivered in time via the FR2 link.
Below, we describe the actions performed by the MgNB

and SgNB (see ﬂowchart in Fig. 3).

A. Actions at the MgNB

First, we describe the actions performed at the MgNB.
When a data packet (PDCP SDU) arrives at the MgNB, the
MgNB executes the following actions: (i) assigns a sequence
number and creates a PDCP PDU (see Step 1.1 in Fig. 3),
(ii) sends it to the SgNB via the Xn interface (Step 1.2), and
(iii) stores its copy (Step 1.3). For that, the MgNB keeps a
separate QUEUE#𝑖 for each data stream 𝑖.

For the PDCP PDU with a sequence number 𝑛, the MgNB
calculates its transmission time 𝑇𝑛 (i.e., the time when the

Now let us consider the actions performed at the SgNB.
All PDCP PDUs arrived from the MgNB are put in the
RLC queue (Step 2.1). The SgNB periodically gets access to
the wireless channel and obtains an opportunity to transmit
some amount of data called MAC PDU (Step 2.2). In this
case, the SgNB can put several PDCP PDUs into the MAC
PDU. SgNB stores correspondence between the MAC PDU
sequence number and PDCP PDUs sequence numbers into a
special structure MAP#𝑖 (Step 2.3). The created MAC PDU
is sent to the physical layer for actual transmission (Step 2.4).
The SgNB receives acknowledgments for successfully de-
livered MAC PDUs (Step 2.5). Upon this event, the SgNB
uses MAP#𝑖 to determine the delivered PDCP PDUs se-
quence numbers (Step 2.6). The SgNB uses the Xn interface
to notify the MgNB about delivered PDCP PDUs (Step 2.7).

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

A. Simulation setup

To compare the performance of the proposed and the
existing trafﬁc balancing algorithms, we use the NS-3 simu-
lator [20] with the mmWave module developed in [21].

We consider a Dense Urban Macro scenario in which UEs
are randomly dropped inside a hexagonal cell. Two gNBs
operating in FR1 and FR2 are located at one of the edges
of the hexagon. The size of the cell (i.e.,
the maximum
distance between the gNBs and the UE) is 133 m, which
corresponds to the inter-site distance of 200 m. The main
simulation parameters are listed in Table I.

A server generates an AR/VR video stream and sends it to
a UE via a cellular system. The size of each video frame is a
random variable deﬁned by the video codec. The video frame
should be delivered within delay budget 𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆 = 15 ms. To
satisfy the AR/VR QoS requirements, the fraction of frames
not delivered in time shall not exceed 𝐹 𝐿𝑅𝑄𝑜𝑆 = 10−2.

and conﬁgure them as follows.

∙ Link Switching. Every 10 ms both the MgNB and the
SgNB measure SINR in the corresponding channels. The
measurements are collected at the MgNB. The MgNB
selects the link with the maximum estimated data rate
taking into account SINR and the channel bandwidth.
∙ Single FR1 gNB. This algorithm corresponds to Link
Switching in which the AR/VR trafﬁc is always for-
warded to the FR1 link.

∙ Single FR2 gNB. This algorithm corresponds to Link
Switching in which the AR/VR trafﬁc is always for-
warded to the FR2 link.

∙ Packet Duplication. The MgNB duplicates data packets

and sends them over both links.

∙ Packet Splitting. Based on the channel measurements,
the MgNB determines the data rate of each link 𝐶𝐹 𝑅1
and 𝐶𝐹 𝑅2. For each packet, the MgNB sends the packet
via the FR1 link with probability 𝑝 = 𝐶𝐹 𝑅1/(𝐶𝐹 𝑅1 +
𝐶𝐹 𝑅2). Otherwise, the MgNB sends the packet via the
FR2 link.

∙ DBTB (Delay-Based Trafﬁc Balancing). The Hybrid Au-
tomatic Repeat Request (HARQ) protocol at the MgNB
is conﬁgured such that the target loss probability for a
single transmission is 10−1 and the time needed to make
additional retransmission is 𝐷𝑅𝑒𝑇 𝑋 = 5 ms.

To evaluate the performance of the described solutions, we

consider the following indicators.

We implement the solutions described in Sections II and IV

∙ Frame Loss Ratio (FLR) is the fraction of video frames

amount of data because it uses a much wider channel. Since
signal attenuation is much higher in FR2 than in FR1, the
data rate of the FR2 link signiﬁcantly decreases with the
distance, which signiﬁcantly increases the channel resource
consumption (see Fig. 4(c)). Eventually, Single FR2 gNB does
not meet 𝐹 𝐿𝑅𝑄𝑜𝑆 at distances higher than 130 m.

The usage of Link Switching and Packet Splitting does not
allow increasing reliability in comparison with the Single FR2
gNB because most of the trafﬁc is forwarded via the FR2 link.
The reason is that the FR2 link has a much higher average
data rate than the FR1 link. Packet Duplication meets the
𝐹 𝐿𝑅𝑄𝑜𝑆 requirement because it always uses the FR1 link.
However, it provides the highest resource consumption in both
FR1 and FR2 links.

The proposed DBTB algorithm also satisﬁes the reliability
requirement but, in contrast to Packet Duplication, uses a
lower amount of the FR1 link channel resources (less than
2%, which is much lower than for Single FR1 gNB). As we
will show below, efﬁcient usage of the FR1 link resources is
fruitful for other AR/VR streams and other types of trafﬁc
that can be served by the MgNB.

C. Multiple AR/VR UEs

In the Multiple AR/VR UEs scenario, we consider multiple
AR/VR UEs randomly dropped inside a hexagonal cell.
Fig. 5(a) shows the ratio of satisﬁed users as a function of
the number of UEs. Following [22], we deﬁne the network
capacity for AR/VR trafﬁc as the maximum number of UEs
for which more than 90% UEs are satisﬁed. We can see
that Single FR2 gNB, Link Switching, and Packet Splitting
algorithms provide the network capacity of only 2 UEs. Note
that Packet Splitting provides a higher number of satisﬁed
UEs than other listed above solutions because it uses the
reliable FR1 link more frequently (see Fig. 5(b)).

Single FR1 gNB also provides low capacity (3 UEs)
because each AR/VR stream consumes a lot of channel
resources and the FR1 link has low bandwidth. Note that the
network capacity is reached when the average resource usage
is approximately 50%. The reason is that video frame size is
not constant. As detailed in Table I, the peak to average frame
size is 2, which means that for transmission of some video
frames two times more channel resources are needed. Thus,
the operator shall take into account AR/VR trafﬁc burstiness
when allocating channel resources.

The proposed DBTB algorithm increases network capacity
by four times compared to Single FR1 gNB and by two
times compared to Packet Duplication. Moreover, we can see
that DBTB consumes less than 10% of the MgNB resources.
Thus, the remaining resources can be used for serving other
trafﬁc types. So, we can conclude that the proposed algorithm
signiﬁcantly increases network capacity for AR/VR trafﬁc
and efﬁciently utilizes expensive low-frequency channel re-
sources.

not delivered within 𝐷𝑄𝑜𝑆.

∙ The ratio of satisﬁed UEs is the ratio of AR/VR UEs for

which FLR does not exceed 𝐹 𝐿𝑅𝑄𝑜𝑆.

∙ Resource usage is the fraction of channel resources
used for data transmission. Resource usage is measured
separately for the MgNB and the SgNB and shows the
utilization of the corresponding links.

B. Single AR/VR UE

In the Single AR/VR UE scenario, we consider a single
AR/VR UE located at a ﬁxed distance from gNBs. Fig. 4
shows the obtained results. We can see that Single FR1 gNB
provides FLR below 𝐹 𝐿𝑅𝑄𝑜𝑆 for all distances. As shown
in Fig. 4(b), a single AR/VR stream occupies approximately
15% of the FR1 link resources. In contrast, Single FR2
gNB requires fewer channel resources to transmit the same

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we considered a scenario in which AR/VR
trafﬁc is served in a 5G system that supports Multi-
Connectivity (MC). A mobile device is connected to two base
stations (gNBs): (i) the ﬁrst one operates in the low-frequency
band (FR1), (ii) the second one operates in the mmWave band
(FR2). We developed a new algorithm called Delay-Based
Trafﬁc Balancing (DBTB) that efﬁciently uses two links with
signiﬁcantly different characteristics. We compared DBTB
with the existing algorithms and showed that DBTB provides
signiﬁcant improvement in terms of the network capacity for
AR/VR trafﬁc and resource utilization of the FR1 link.

In future works, we are going to extend our algorithm for
scenarios in which a UE could be connected to multiple gNBs
operating in FR2.
