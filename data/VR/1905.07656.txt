Abstract—Guaranteeing ultra reliable low latency communi-
cations (URLLC) with high data rates for virtual reality (VR)
services is a key challenge to enable a dual VR perception: visual
and haptic. In this paper, a terahertz (THz) cellular network is
considered to provide high-rate VR services, thus enabling a suc-
cessful visual perception. For this network, guaranteeing URLLC
with high rates requires overcoming the uncertainty stemming
from the THz channel. To this end, the achievable reliability
and latency of VR services over THz links are characterized.
In particular, a novel expression for the probability distribution
function of the transmission delay is derived as a function
of the system parameters. Subsequently, the end-to-end (E2E)
delay distribution that takes into account both processing and
transmission delay is found and a tractable expression of the
reliability of the system is derived as a function of the THz
network parameters such as the molecular absorption loss and
noise, the transmitted power, and the distance between the
VR user and its respective small base station (SBS). Numerical
results show the effects of various system parameters such as the
bandwidth and the region of non-negligible interference on the
reliability of the system. In particular, the results show that THz
can deliver rates up to 16.4 Gbps and a reliability of 99.999%
(with a delay threshold of 30 ms) provided that the impact of the
molecular absorption on the THz links, which substantially limits
the communication range of the SBS, is alleviated by densifying
the network accordingly.

I. INTRODUCTION

Virtual reality (VR) is perhaps one of the most anticipated
technologies of the coming decade [1]. However, relying on
wired VR systems signiﬁcantly limits the VR application
domain. Instead, the deployment of wireless VR, over cellular
networks, can potentially unleash its true potential [1], [2]. In
order to integrate VR services over wireless networks, it is im-
perative to ensure ultra reliable low latency communications
(URLLC) [2]. Predominantly, the end-to-end (E2E) delay for
wireless VR needs very low (at the order of tens of mil-
liseconds) in order to maintain a satisfactory user experience.
Moreover, along with URLLC, wireless VR services will also
require high data rates in order to deliver the 360◦ content to
their users. Guaranteeing high data rates with URLLC requires
a major departure from classical URLLC services that were
limited to low-rate sensors [3]. To overcome this challenge,
one can explore the high bandwidth available at the terahertz
(THz) frequency bands which can enable high-rate wireless
access for VR [4]. However, the reliability of the THz channel
can be impeded by its susceptibility to blockage, molecular
absorption, and communication range. Thus, it is imperative
to understand whether THz frequencies can indeed provide an

immersive VR experience by delivering URLLC at high rates.
A number of recent works attempted to address the challenges
of VR communications [2], [5]–[8]. In [2], the authors discuss
the current and future trends of wireless VR systems. The
work in [5] introduces a perception-based mixed-reality video
streaming delivery system to provide the aggregate data rates
needed for VR services. In [6], the authors propose a VR
model using multi-attribute utility theory to capture the Mean-
while, the recent works in [7] and [8] study the problem of
ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC) for VR
networks. In [7], the issue of concurrent support of visual and
haptic perceptions over wireless cellular networks is studied,
while the work in [8] proposes a joint proactive computing
and millimeter wave resource allocation scheme under latency
and reliability constraints. However, these prior works [6]–[8]
only examine the average delays and data rates; thus reﬂecting
limited information about the systems analyzed. In contrast, to
guarantee URLLC, it is necessary to have a full view of the
statistics of the delay in order to properly characterize the
system’s reliability. Last, but not least, we note that the use of
THz has recently attracted attention (e.g., see [9] and [4]) as
an enabler of high data rate applications. However, these prior
works in [9] and [4] do not address issues of reliability or
low-latency for wireless VR systems. Clearly, there is a lack
in existing works that study the potential of THz frequencies
to deliver high-data rate VR services while providing URLLC.
The main contribution of this paper is to analyse the
delay and reliability performance of a cellular network op-
erating at THz frequencies and servicing VR users. The
ultimate goal is to assess how and when a THz network can
meet the dual requirements of the quality-of-service (QoS)
of a VR user,
in terms of URLLC and high data rates.
In particular, we introduce a novel VR model based on
a Matern hardcore point process (MHCPP). In the studied
model, each VR user sends a request
to its respective
small base station (SBS), which induces an E2E delay that
includes the delay needed to process the VR images and the
transmission delay over the THz links. Based on this model,
to ﬁnd the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the E2E
delay, we derive the probability distribution function (PDF) of
the transmission delay in a dense THz network. Subsequently,
this allows us to derive the reliability of the system and to
characterize the network parameters that affect this reliability.
To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that analyzes
the reliability and latency achieved by VR services over a
THz cellular network. Simulation results show that reliability
is mainly affected by the transmission delay, which can be
signiﬁcantly reduced by providing the system with higher

 
 
 
 
 
 
bandwidth or through densifying the network to maintain
short-range communication between SBSs and users,
thus
overcoming the molecular absorption effects and guaranteeing
reliability.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

V

Consider the downlink of a small cell network servicing
a set
of V wireless VR users via a set of SBSs dis-
tributed in a conﬁned indoor area according to an isotropic
homogeneous MHCPP with intensity η and a minimum
distance r [10]. This process is a special thinning of the
Poisson point process (PPP) in which the nodes are forbid-
den to be closer than a minimum distance r. Here,
the
parameter r indicates that
the distance between adjacent
nodes cannot be arbitrarily small in the real-life phenomenon.
Hence, this process can adequately capture the distribution
of VR SBSs in a conﬁned area. The SBSs can also perform
mobile edge computing (MEC) functions for VR purposes.

A. Wireless Capacity

M

We consider an arbitrary VR user in

that is at a constant
distance d0 from its respective SBS. Hence, the chosen VR
user and its respective SBS are referred to as tagged receiver
and transmitter respectively. The interference surrounding this
VR user stems from a set
of M non-negligible interfering
SBSs that are located within a radius of Ω around this user.
This interference occurs because we consider a highly dense
THz network whose SBSs are located at very close proximity.
Ω add no
Henceforth, the SBSs that are at a distance d
interference on the link between the VR user to its associated
SBS. As shown in [11], the signal propagation at the THz-
band is mainly affected by molecular absorption, which results
in molecular absorption loss and molecular absorption noise.
Given that the distance between the VR user and its respective
SBS is short in our model, we consider a line-of-sight (LoS)
link only, as also done in [9]. Consequently, the total path loss
affecting the transmitted signal between the SBS and the VR
user will be given by [11]:

user, and pi denotes the transmission power of the interference

From (5), we can see that the only random factor is the
second term in the denominator which corresponds to the
interfering signals. For technical tractability, following [11],
we assume that this term tends to a normal distribution [12].
Note that, it has been shown in [11] that such an approximation
is realistic. Furthermore, ﬁnding the mean and variance of this
term will allow us to characterise the PDF of this random
interference signal, as follows:

pi is omitted given that the SBSs are assumed to have the
same transmission power. As shown in [11], µI and σI can
be derived based upon the Poisson approximation for the
distances between the tagged receiver and the interferers.
Given the high bandwidth available at the THz band can
provide high-rate wireless VR, however, it is necessary to
analyze whether this network can provide URLLC. Next, we
will analyze the delay of the considered system and, then,
leverage this analysis to deﬁne reliability.

 
that reliability cannot be deﬁned merely on average values of
delays as done in [6] and [2]. Given the stringent requirements
of VR services, a full view on the statistics of the delay must
be to be taken into account in order to design a system capable
of withstanding extreme and infrequently occurring events
such as a sudden user movement that changes its distance
from its respective SBS or a sudden blockage between the
user and the SBS which can impact reliability.

B. Reliability Analysis

The reliability of the considered wireless VR system can
be deﬁned as a guarantee that the E2E delay can be main-
tained below a target threshold δ. Formally, reliability is the
probability that the E2E delay – deﬁned as the delay incurred
between the time the VR user requests a VR image to the time
the image is received – remains below δ. Hence, the system
is guaranteed to have high reliability when this probability is
high and tends to 1. For our model in Fig. 1, given that Q1
is an M/M/1 queue, the PDF of the total waiting time at Q1
will be [13]:

ψ1(t) = (µ1 −

λ1) exp (

(µ1 −

−

(9)

Moreover, given that Q2 is an M/G/1 queue and that the
queuing and service time of an M/G/1 queue are independent,
we can derive that the CDF of the total waiting time:

(11)

Ψ2(t) = ΨQ2 (t)

the number of states that the queue has went through, i.e., the
number of packets that has passed through the queue during a
certain amount of time and R(n)(t) is the CDF of the residual
service time after the n-th state. Note that R(n)(t) can be

III. RELIABILITY ANALYSIS

A. Delay Analysis

The service model of the VR image request in our wireless
VR system is illustrated in Fig. 1. As shown, once a VR
user requests a VR image, this request will go through two
queues: a ﬁrst queue, Q1, that pertains to processing a 360◦
VR image, and a second queue, Q2, that pertains to storing
and transmitting the VR images over the wireless THz channel.
Here, we assume that the time for sending a request by the
VR user is negligible. Hence, for each VR image request, the
total delay depends on the waiting and the processing time
at Q1 and the waiting time and VR transmission delay at
Q2. We assume that a VR image request follows a Poisson
arrival process with mean rate λ1. The buffer of the processor
is assumed to be of inﬁnite size and the MEC processor
at the SBS adopts the ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-serve (FCFS) policy.
The service time for each request follows an exponential
distribution with rate parameter µ1 > λ1, to guarantee the
stability of the ﬁrst queue Q1. Thus, we can see that the queue
Q1 is an M/M/1 queue. According to Burke’s theorem [13],
when the service rate is larger than the arrival rate for an
M/M/1 queue, then the departure process at steady state is a
Poisson process with the same arrival rate. Hence, the arrival
of requests to Q2 also follows a Poisson process with rate
λ2 = µ1. Similar to Q1, we assume an inﬁnite buffer size
and an FCFS policy for Q2. Note that, the service time of
Q2 is the transmission time of the SBS, that depends on the
random wireless THz channels. Thus, different from Q1, the
second queue Q2 is an M/G/1 queue. Our goal is to study
when and how the proposed THz system can guarantee the
dual QoS requirement required by VR, i.e. visual and haptic
perceptions. This dual perception requires a high data rate link
for visual perception and a low latency communication for the
haptic. Under favorable channel conditions, THz is capable of
providing high rate links, however, providing URLLC may be
challenging. Hence, our key step is to deﬁne the reliability
of this system and study the performance of the VR network.
This performance analysis will shed light on the capability of
THz to provide a dual-metric performance for VR. To analyze
reliability, next, we ﬁrst derive the PDF of the transmission
delay of our THz network. This expression will
then be
used to derive the CDF of the E2E delay characterizing the
reliability of the system and the QoS. It is important to note

Proof: Based on (5), we express the capacity in terms of

L and α as:

Consequently, the reliability can be deﬁned as the probability
of the E2E delay not exceeding a certain threshold δ, i.e.,

We can see that the only random term in (15) is the in-

It is important to note that the PDF in (19) does not follow
a normal distribution since both Υ and ζ depend on the
transmission delay α. Burke’s Theorem allows us to infer that
Q1 and Q2 are independent; therefore, the CDF of the E2E
delay can be expressed as the convolution of the PDF of the
total waiting time in Q1 and the CDF of the total waiting time
in Q2. By using the dynamics of (9) and (10), the CDF of the
E2E delay can formally expressed in the following theorem
which is a direct result of Lemma 1.

The reliability in (21) allows a tractable characterization of
the reliability of the VR system shown in Fig. 1, as function
of the THz channel parameters. Furthermore, from Theorem
1, we can ﬁrst see that the queuing time of Q2 depends on
the residual service time CDF and hence on the transmission
delay. Also, given that the processing speed of the MEC
servers can be considerably high, the E2E delay will often
be dominated by the transmission delay of THz. Moreover,
in general, all the key parameters that have a high impact
on the transmission delay will have a higher impact on
reliability. One of the most important key parameters is the
distance d0 between the VR user and its respective SBS; this
follows from the fact that the molecular absorption loss gets
signiﬁcantly higher when the distance increases, which limits
the communication range of THz SBSs to very few meters.
Indeed, the THz reliability will deteriorate drastically if the
distance between the VR user and its respective SBS increased.
Given that the QoS of a VR application is a function of the
reliability, i.e., it is the reliability of the system throughout the
worst case scenario. VR users’ immersion and experience will
depend signiﬁcantly on the reliability. Therefore, maintaining
reliability is a necessary condition to guarantee the QoS for the
user, thus increasing its satisfaction and yielding it a seamless
experience.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

For our simulations, we consider the following parameters:
T = 300 K, p = 1 W, L = 10 Mbits, f = 1 THz,
K(f ) = 0.0016 m−1 with 1% of water vapor molecules as
in [14], λ1 = 0.1 packets/s, and µ1 = 2 Gbps. These values
are chosen to comply with existing VR processing units such
as the GEFORCE RTX 2080 Ti [15]. The SBSs are deployed
20 m.
in an indoor area modeled as a square of size 20 m
All statistical results are averaged over a large number of
independent runs.

×

Fig. 2 shows that the simulation results match the distri-
bution of the analytical result derived in (12). The small gap
between the analytical and simulation results stems from the
normal distribution of the interference.

Fig. 3 (a) shows the prominent effect of the bandwidth
on the reliability at different δ. We can see that the relia-
bility monotonically increases with both the bandwidth and
reliability threshold δ. Subsequently, we can see that, in order
to achieve a reliability of 99.999% at δ =30 ms, we need a
bandwidth of 10 GHz. For our THz system, this corresponds to
a data rate of 16.4 Gbps. Clearly, the target reliability for VR
services can be achieved with high rates at THz frequencies,
assuming sufﬁcient bandwidth is available. Furthermore, the
reliability for δ = 10 ms saturates around W = 13 GHz.
This is due to the fact that the delay in Q2 has reached a
point where it is equal to the delay in Q1 in Fig.3(b); after
that point, the delay becomes dominated by the delay in Q1

rather than Q2. Furthermore, a very high reliability cannot be
achieved for δ = 10 ms in Fig. 3 (a) due to the delay at Q1.
Hence, the limitation in reliability for a very low threshold,
namely δ = 10 ms is mainly a result of the processing speed
at the MEC server. Also, it is important to note that before
the point of saturation, the reliability is mainly dominated by
the transmission delay which conﬁrms the result obtained in
(20).

In Fig. 4, we show how the reliability varies as a function
of the region of non-negligible interference. We can see
that, when the distance between the VR user and the SBS
increases, the region of non-negligible interference Ω has a
higher impact on the reliability, and the drop of reliability
is sharper. This phenomenon is observed regardless of the
reliability threshold δ. Hence, even though the user can achieve
high reliability, the dependence of the molecular absorption on
distance limits the user to a very short distance to its respective
SBS. Thus, the VR user can guarantee reliability regardless of
the interference surrounding it, given that it is at a proximity
from the respective SBS.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have studied the reliability of VR services
deployed in a THz cellular network. To obtain an expression
for the end-to-end delay and reliability, we have proposed a
model based on a two tandem queue. We have derived the PDF
of the transmission delay of a THz cellular network, based on
which, we have derived the E2E delay expression along with
the reliability of this system. We have shown that operating
at THz frequencies can potentially enable VR services to
have high reliability and high rates when provided with high

bandwidth and proximity to the respective SBS. Hence, the
design of these networks requires managing a tradeoff between
the bandwidth used and the average proximity of the user to
the respective SBS.
