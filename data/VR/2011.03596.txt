Abstract: As life expectancy is mostly increasing, the incidence of many neurological disorders is 
also constantly growing. For improving the physical functions affected by a neurological disorder, 
rehabilitation  procedures  are  mandatory,  and  they  must  be  performed  regularly.  Unfortunately, 
neurorehabilitation  procedures  have  disadvantages  in  terms  of  costs,  accessibility  and  a  lack  of 
therapists.  This  paper  presents  Immersive  Neurorehabilitation  Exercises  Using  Virtual  Reality 
(INREX-VR), our innovative immersive neurorehabilitation system using virtual reality. The system 
is based on a thorough research methodology and is able to capture real-time user movements and 
evaluate  joint  mobility  for  both  upper  and  lower  limbs,  record  training  sessions  and  save 
electromyography data. The use of the first-person perspective increases immersion, and the joint 
range of motion is calculated with the help of both the HTC Vive system and inverse kinematics 
principles applied  on skeleton rigs. Tutorial exercises  are demonstrated by  a virtual therapist, as 
they were recorded with real-life physicians, and sessions can be monitored and configured through 
tele-medicine.  Complex  movements  are  practiced  in  gamified  settings,  encouraging  self-
improvement and competition. Finally, we proposed a training plan and preliminary tests which 
show promising results in terms of accuracy and user feedback. As future developments, we plan 
to improve the system’s accuracy and investigate a wireless alternative based on neural networks.

1. Introduction 

Neurological disorders affect more and more people nowadays, especially given the fact that life 
expectancy  is  currently  increasing  and  we  are  facing  an  ageing  population.  According  to  the 
predictions of the United Nations, “by 2050, 1 in 6 people in the world will be over the age of 65, up 
from 1 in 11 in 2019” [1]. A highly comprehensive and detailed study spanned across three decades 
and  including  195  countries  shows  the  burden  of  neurological  disorders  [2].  In 2016,  neurological 
disorders  (including  stroke,  Parkinson’s  disease,  central  nervous  system  trauma  and  so  on) 
represented  the  first  cause  of  DALY  (disability-adjusted  life  years)  and  the  second  cause  of  death 
(16.5% of global deaths) [2]. People suffering from neurological disorders have their quality of life 
(QoL)  largely  affected,  in  terms  of  physical  activities,  mental  or  social  functioning  (usually  called

generically  as  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQL)  [3].  Physical  activities  including  walking, 
grabbing, clenching fist or other fine motor skills, day-to-day activities or deglutition are some of the 
functionalities commonly affected by neurological conditions that have serious consequences over 
the QoL of a person. In addition, cognitive, communication, or social functionalities are also affected. 
As neurological disorders represent the second cause of death at global level, innovative systems are 
needed for improving the QoL of the sufferers. 

Specific physical exercises are beneficial for both rehabilitation procedures and for preventing 
the advancement of a disorder. As many neurological disorders are untreatable or have permanent 
effects,  the  rehabilitation  should  focus  on  treating  the  symptoms  or  reducing  the  disease’s 
progression. Unfortunately, the number of therapists is limited, so that new alternatives are needed 
for  globally  improving  the  neurorehabilitation  process  [4].  The  progress  reached  until  now  in  the 
field of neurorehabilitation is not enough to reach the goals targeted by the United Nations in terms 
of sustainable development until 2030 [5]. More measures must be taken in order to help improve the 
quality of life of people affected by neurological diseases and decrease the effects or advancement of 
degenerative disorders. One of the ways of addressing the challenges faced by neurorehabilitation is 
by including consumable affordable devices based on emergent technologies (reducing the costs of 
each therapy session, increasing accessibility, reducing the number of therapists needed for face-to-
face interventions by providing tele-rehabilitation capabilities). The evolution of virtual reality made 
it  the  main  focus  of  numerous  studies  from  the  past  decade  which  show  that  VR  is  a  technology 
which facilitates the creation of realistic environments and training exercises suitable for a wide range 
of neurological disorders. Virtual reality can optimize individualized training, bring entertainment 
and motivation through gamified settings, replicate daily tasks and/or common environments (e.g., 
streets, shops etc.) and offer the perfect context for collecting the data needed for monitoring progress 
and evaluating the rehabilitation process [6]. 

We  present  Immersive  Neurorehabilitation  Exercises  Using  Virtual  Reality  (INREX-VR),  a 
complex  virtual  reality  (VR)  system  that  facilitates  the  neurorehabilitation  process,  by  allowing 
patients to self-train at home and have their progress monitored by specialists. The system targets 
neurological disorders such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease and trauma of the central and peripheral 
nervous  system,  so  that  it  includes  both  conditions  with  a  very  high  prevalence  (e.g.,  stroke)  and 
those affecting people of all age ranges (e.g., Parkinson’s affecting mostly elder people, the trauma of 
the nervous system affecting both young and elder) that can be rehabilitated using VR-based therapy. 
The  flexibility  of  the  proposed  framework  also  makes  it  suitable  for  medical  personnel  training 
(including  rehabilitation  physicians,  nurses,  kinesiotherapists  or  medicine  students).  By  using  a 
variety of affordable consumer devices and sensors (HTC Vive with motion tracking, Myo gesture 
control armband including electromyography - EMG, and pulse measurement), a great number of 
exercises can be performed in order to help recover lost functionalities, delay the advancement of a 
degenerative disorders, or improve and maintain physical condition. Furthermore, the data provided 
by  the  sensors  can  be  stored,  shared  and  further  analyzed  by  specialists,  in  order  to  assess  the 
progress, the stage of the disorder and the training process. Although they are medically grounded, 
all  proposed  exercises  are  gamified,  enabling  a  pleasant  and  engaging  experience,  maximizing 
patients’  involvement,  in  order  to  ensure  the  constant,  sustained  training,  for  relevant  results  on 
people’s QoL. 

In  the  following  chapters,  we  will  present  a  study  containing  both  an  analysis  of  the  current 
stage  of  neurological  rehabilitation  and  our  proposed  approach.  Section  2  presents  the  medical 
fundamentals  of  the  neurological  disorders  chosen  as  a  target  for  the  system,  and  the  existing 
solutions of classical therapy. Section 3 focuses on presenting a thorough research methodology and 
the state of the art of the modern, technology-based treatment methods. In Section 4, we describe the 
system, including functionalities, hardware and software components. Finally, Section 5 shows the 
preliminary results after testing the system with users, and we draw the conclusions and underline 
some possible future improvements in Section 6.

2. Neurological Disorders and the Classical Treatment 

We will further present the neurological disorders targeted by our system in terms of causes, 

symptoms and their classical treatment.   

Parkinson’s  disease  (PD)  is  described  as  a  progressive  disorder  which  affects  the  nervous 
system, sometimes  manifested  through a  slight  tremble of  one  of the  hands.  The  disorder’s  debut 
often  passes  unnoticed,  as  these  mild  symptoms  specific  to  the  disease’s  initial  stage  are  usually 
ignored or associated to other causes (e.g., aging). Parkinson’s disease has five main stages, where 
the patient’s condition is degrading progressively: starting from mild symptoms which do not affect 
their quality of life (stage 1), reaching serious balance and movement issues (stage 3) and walking 
incapacity and need of permanent assistance (stage 5). 

PD is an irreversible disorder of the nervous system, and since there is no existing treatment, 

prevention and diagnosis during early stages become extremely important. 

Most of the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are related to movement. Tremors are present as 
precocious symptoms for 70% of PD patients; they affect firstly one finger, then they extend to the 
entire hand and finally to the lower limb. Tremor appears when the limb is in resting position, which 
in fact stands as one of the reasons why exercising is essential in the case of PD patients [7]. When the 
disorder is diagnosed by observing the upper limb tremor or the slowness of movements, the stage 
of  the  disease  is  rather  advanced.  The  neurological  manifestations  of  PD  include:  bradykinesia 
(slowness  of  movements),  tremor  of  upper  and  lower  limbs,  high  muscle  tone,  increased  rigidity, 
with the back crooked similar to a question mark, freezing of gait (incapacity of moving even though 
the intention exists), lack of physiological co-ordination of arms when walking, micrographia (small 
and unreadable writing), hypomimia (facial expressions look like a mask), hypophonia (soft, quiet 
voice) [8]. 

Parkinson’s  disease  has  no  cure,  but  specific  treatments  can  slow  it  down  or  treat  specific 
symptoms/improve lost functionalities. Some of the available treatments include medication, surgery 
[9], implanting pluripotent stem cells (a modern procedure based on personalized, patient-specific 
treatment, which uses fetal cell transplantation for completing the affected neurons) [10,11]. 

As movement is extremely affected in PD, physical activities become very important, especially 
during the first three stages of the disease. They have an important role and can have benefits over: 
walking, balance, fine motor skills, joint mobility, flexed posture, facial mimics [8]. Physical activity 
for treating Parkinson’s disease must take into consideration the fact that the therapy must start with 
easy  exercises,  that  do  not  exhaust  the  patient,  and  their  intensity  must  increase  gradually.  Some 
recommendations include: 

• 

Performing  movements  on  the  rhythm  of  the  music,  which  can  be  both  motivating  and  can 
facilitate the exercises; 

•  Applying guiding markers and limits (either visual, auditory or haptic)—this can be achieved 
with special glasses/headsets and sensors, which can help patients maintain the same pace and 
continue exercising; 
Staying hydrated (as neurons responsible for thirst are also affected); 
Perform  physical  exercises  somewhere  around  noon  (stiffness  is  increased  in  the  morning, 
tiredness occurs in the evening). 

• 
• 

During exercises, various health parameters must be monitored, including blood pressure, heart 

rate and oxygen saturation [12]. 

Stroke  represents  a  neurological  disorder  which  appears  when  the  blood  flow  is  severely 
diminished or even disrupted in a brain region. As a consequence, it produces the death of brain cells 
which are not irrigated and oxygenized. The time period of the neurons’ destruction varies between 
a  few  minutes  to  several  hours,  producing  instantly  various  neurological  symptoms:  paralysis, 
numbness or weakness of the face, upper or lower limbs (according to the body area controlled by 
the affected brain cells). The consequences of stroke can be severe, including disability or even death, 
therefore a quick medical intervention is essential for saving the patient’s life and diminishing the 
disorder’s effects and complications [13].

Stroke symptoms include: speech and understanding difficulties, muscle weakness or paralysis 
of a limb (upper or lower) or of the right/left side of the face, sudden headaches, dizziness, nausea, 
visual  impairments,  balance  problems  (falling,  lack  of  coordination),  unconsciousness,  skin 
sensitivity of the affected limb/face side [13,14]. 

Stroke’s  general  treatment  requires  the  continuous  monitoring  of  the  neurological  state,  also 
including  the  measurements  of  important  health  parameters.  Immediate  interventions  involve 
endovascular  or  surgical  procedures.  Under  1/3  of  people  affected  by  stroke  manage  to  recover 
completely,  and  rigorous  rehabilitation  procedures  are  needed  in  order  to  maintain  physical, 
intellectual  and  social  functions  in  optimum  parameters.  Rehabilitation  in  the  case  of  stroke  is 
multidisciplinary,  including  specific  medication,  physiotherapy  (intensive  exercises  involving  the 
affected limb; if this is the case, functional electrical stimulation can improve efficiency), occupational 
therapy  (for  recovering  work  activities,  daily  activities,  hobbies  etc.),  speech  therapy,  cognitive 
training for attention deficit. 

For recovering the motor deficit, physical exercises can be performed either passively (with a 

therapist) or actively (alone), during the three broad stages of stroke rehabilitation [15,16]: 

2. 

1.  Flaccid stage—when the patient presents no muscle tone or voluntary movement, some of their 
reflexes  disappear;  correcting  posture  and  applying  therapeutic  massage  are  used  for 
maintaining joint and muscular integrity; 
Spastic stage—after  approximately 3 weeks  since the  occurrence of the  stroke,  muscle  tone is 
increased,  and  voluntary  movement  control  starts  to  appear;  this  stage  includes  kinetic 
rehabilitation programs, based on sensory-motor techniques, exercises for increasing muscular 
force and movement amplitude, as well as balance and posture; some of the used techniques are 
based on altering perception—mirror therapy (reflecting the movement of a non-affected limb 
over  the  affected  one,  creating  the  illusion  of  movement)  [17],  virtual  reality  therapy  (virtual 
limbs  created  in  the  virtual  environment,  with  real  movements  performed  repeatedly,  and 
usually augmented in the virtual world)—or on stimulation (muscular or cerebral stimulation). 
3.  Chronic/recovered stage—the motor deficit is established; therefore, it is very hard to recover at 

this stage; therapy is needed for health maintenance. 

Our system focuses on helping people in the second rehabilitation stage but can be further used 

for health maintenance. 

Other neurological disorders affecting the central and peripheral nervous system include spinal 
disc herniation, neuropathies, sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome or trauma caused by work-related or 
car  accidents.  We  will  shortly  describe  two  of  the  most  common  ones,  disc  herniation  and 
neuropathies. 

Disc  herniation  is  a  disorder  which  occurs  when  an  intervertebral  disc  is  deteriorated.  The 
herniated disc can come in contact with or press on nerves or on the spinal cord, thus causing pain, 
numbness and weakness at the limb level [18]. 

In  the  case  of  disc  herniation,  there  are  several  types  of  treatment  available:  conservative 
(avoiding  body  poses  which are causing  pain; exercising), medical  treatment,  kinesiotherapy, and 
surgery [19]. 

Neuropathies refer to a series of disorders which appear when nerves of the peripheral system 
(part of the nervous system, outside the brain and spinal cord) are being deteriorated. Different types 
of neuropathies include the affection of multiple individual nerves or the generalized affection of all 
peripheral nerves (e.g., neuropathy caused by diabetes). For 30% of cases, the cause of neuropathy is 
not  known,  30%  are  caused  by  diabetes,  while  others  include  trauma,  vitamin  deficit,  alcohol 
consumption, tumors, HIV and so on [20]. Present symptoms are motor or sensitive, including pain 
and limb numbness, and can lead to traumatic injuries, infections and metabolic disorders [9]. 

Neuropathies  treatment  can  be  done  through  medication,  alternative  treatment  (chemical  or 

electrical stimulation of the spinal cord), and physical exercises [9].

3. ICT Solutions for Neurological Disorders Treatment 

To establish the current state of the research in this field, and for determining the functionalities, 
goals and technologies used in the INREX-VR system, we conducted a research methodology based 
on  the  systematic  review  of  the  available  state  of  the  art.  We  collected  papers  from  four  major 
databases:  Elsevier  (Scopus),  IEEE  Xplore,  SpringerLink  and  PubMed,  from  January  1995  to  June 
2020. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) 
[21]  for  studying  relevant  articles,  for  analyzing  the  feasibility  of  our  system,  establishing 
functionalities, targeted users and validating the technological alternatives (Figure 1). 

Figure 1. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) steps for 
the research methodology 

The process of the PRISMA analysis that we applied includes four main stages (identification, 
screening, eligibility and inclusion), and seven detailed steps (as we divided the screening stage into 
four sub-stages). 

In  the  first  step,  we  managed  to  identify  a  total  of  2530  papers  from  the  four  mentioned 
databases. As a research tool, we used the following formula (1) for selecting the papers that contain 
these important topics in their title, abstract or keywords. The number of papers identified based on 
each database can be seen in Table 1: 

TITLE-ABS-KEY = ((“neurological disorder” OR “neurocognitive disorder” OR 
  “neurorehabilitation” OR “neurological rehabilitation”) AND “virtual reality”)

In the second step, we started the screening process of the papers. We removed duplicates, by 
using  two  steps:  firstly  we  removed  the  papers  having  the  same  digital  object  identifier—digital 
object identifier (DOI) (376 duplicates removed) and secondly, we compared the papers with no DOI 
based on a title/authors combination (thus eliminating duplicates or extended papers—43 additional 
duplicates removed). After this step, we obtained 2111 papers. At this moment, we could analyze the 
topicality  of  our  research  subject  across  the  years  (Figure  2).  The  increased  interest  can  be  easily 
observed in the last  20 years, coinciding with the  technological  advancement in the virtual reality 
field.

Figure  2.  Evolution  of  the  number  of  research  papers  related  to  virtual  reality-based 
neurorehabilitation in the last 25 years. 

In  the  third  step,  we  continued  the  screening  process  by  thoroughly  analyzing  the  titles  and 
abstracts of the selected studies; we thus eliminated 863 papers, including extended ones that were 
not  focusing  on  our  area  of  interest  (e.g.,  books,  chapters),  papers  that  referred  to  other  types  of 
neurocognitive  disorders  that  are  not  suitable  for  our  research  topic  and  rehabilitation  system 
proposition (e.g., autism, dementia, anxiety disorders, phantom  limb pain,  cerebral palsy),  papers 
focusing on economic aspects or legislation. We thus obtained 1248 articles. 

After  these  screening  steps,  we  analyzed  statistics  of  the  papers,  to  see  what  are  the  main 
technologies targeted. We identified papers focusing on robotics, virtual reality, augmented reality, 
mixed  reality  and  reviews/surveys  on  one  or  more  of  these  technologies  used  in  rehabilitation 
scenarios, general platforms focusing on experiments and/or treatment (Table 2).

Since  the  work  presented  on  this  paper  focuses  on  virtual  reality,  we  eliminated  the  general 
papers and the ones focusing mostly on a different type of technology (robotics, augmented reality 
or  mixed  reality).  Furthermore,  we  wanted  to  have  a  deep  insight  on  the  original  projects  using 
neurological  rehabilitation  and  virtual  reality,  therefore,  we  eliminated  also  the  reviews  and  the 
surveys. We thus performed the fourth step, the VR-focused screening and we got 501 papers (747 
excluded). 

For the fifth step, the screening was based on technological evolution: since technology evolves 
rapidly, including topics such as VR and sensors, we decided to keep only papers from the last 10 
years (105 papers were removed) and we got 396 papers left from the period 2010—2020. For the sixth 
step, we decided to filter the papers based on their International Scientific Indexing (ISI)—therefore 
113 papers were excluded and there were 283 left. In order to find the ISI papers, the advanced search 
was used for the entire batch of papers on Web of Science based on the papers’ digital object identifier 
(DOI) or based on title and authors combination (if they had no DOI). After this last screening step, 
we analyzed the disorders targeted by the 283 papers remaining. In Table 3, we identified the number 
of  papers  concerning  stroke,  Parkinson’s  disease,  brain  trauma  or  spinal  cord  trauma.  The  other 
papers address either multiple disorders (e.g., central nervous system trauma in general) or focus on 
a certain functionality/therapy, regardless of the targeted disorder (e.g., upper limb therapy, gait or 
balance control). We can observe that a high number of papers are focusing on stroke (also probably 
related to the high number of people affected by this disorder and the prediction related to its future 
burden [22] and rise in younger people [23]). We must take this into consideration for designing our 
system, yet make sure it is flexible enough for a larger number of disorders.

For the seventh and final step, we thoroughly analyzed the abstracts and the full papers (if the 
abstract was not detailed enough). We selected what we consider to be the most valuable for the final 
qualitative  assessment  and  for  establishing  the  characteristics  of  our  system—therefore,  scientific 
papers using sensors and trying to cover all three main disorders (PD, stroke, affections of central or 
peripheral nervous system) were preferred. In addition, we included all papers that presented home-
based systems, since an important part of our proposed system has the focus on self-training. The 
final number of records that were included in our state of the art analysis was 41 papers. After the 
final step of the research, we concluded that all papers could be classified based on different criteria 
(Figure 3). We are going to focus for the rest of our state of the art analysis on the last classification 
type, based on technology. 

Figure 3. Classification of research papers of the state of the art analysis based on different criteria. 

Among  the  first  technologies  used  for  neurorehabilitation  purposes  was  robotics.  From  end-
effector  to  exoskeletons,  robotic  devices  have  been  used  especially  for  upper  and  lower  limb 
rehabilitation, with positive results [24,25]. Unfortunately, robot-based solutions are not suitable for 
home  use,  as  they  can  be  difficult  to  maintain,  to  store  and  can  reach  costs  of  several  hundred 
thousands  of  dollars  [26].  In  clinical  settings,  combining  robotics  and  VR  can  bring  multimodal 
feedback, augment movement and speed up the recovery process [27]. Furthermore, studies show 
that combining these two technologies can bring great improvements for walking rehabilitation, as 
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals show that the brain activity is more intense when robot-assisted 
walking is accompanied by virtual environments (when compared with mirror therapy—seeing their 
own movements—or with unrelated visual stimuli) [28]. If robotics and VR-based neurorehabilitation 
also ensures the immersion of the person in the virtual environment [29] (e.g., by creating an accurate 
representation of the real limb in the virtual world and of the movements performed [30]), the user 
can  become  more  motivated  and  encouraged  to  continue  training.  In  addition,  the  evolution  of 
sensors’  reliability  and  accuracy  of  real-time  adaptive  learning  algorithms  can  decrease  the 
dependency of the patient on robotic or human assistance (from therapist or caregiver) [31]. 

Alternative  technological  solutions  for  neurorehabilitation  include  the  use  of  virtual  reality, 
motion and biological sensors, combined in different manners. Some of the earliest solutions from 
the last decade based on the extended definition of VR involved the use of a Nintendo Wii gaming 
console for upper-limb rehabilitation [32,33]. This gaming console is based on using various motion 
tracking sensors in a remote-control device for performing various movements (e.g., playing sports) 
with a virtual avatar that can be followed on a television screen, in a non-immersive virtual reality 
setting.  Despite  its  lack  of  immersion,  the  Wii  system  has  been  proven  to  be  more  efficient  for 

 
 
Sensors 2020, 20, 6045 

8  of  47 

rehabilitation  than  other  forms  of  treatment,  such  as  recreational  therapy  [32],  and  as  efficient  as 
classical physical therapy [34]. Other versions of the device, such as Wii fit, include a standing board 
which can be used for balance training [35]. As many technical solutions focus only on upper body 
rehabilitation, Microsoft Kinect comes as an alternative of assuring full-body tracking [36]. Studies 
show that Kinect-based VR neurorehabilitation can provide low-cost solutions that can help brain 
reorganization  which  stands  as  the  basis  of  motor  recovery  [37,38].  The  principle  of  most  Kinect 
applications is based on mapping human motions on poses of the virtual avatar’s limbs, in a manner 
as accurate as possible [39], for instance when playing sports such as tennis or boxing [40]. 

Immersion plays a significant role in VR-based applications, as studies show that non-immersive 
systems  can  lead  to  lower  performances  when  executing  classical  rehabilitation  movements  (e.g., 
flexion, extension, head rotation) [41]. Embodiment and sense of presence are proven to be improved 
for  both  healthy  and  neurologically  affected  individuals  if  the  virtual  training  procedures  are 
executed from a first person perspective as opposed to a third person one [42]. Furthermore, virtual 
mirror exercises (the user’s movements are mapped on a virtual limb seen through an immersive VR 
headset) seem to generate a higher degree of corticospinal response when compared to real mirror 
therapy (seeing the reflection of an unaffected limb during training) [37]. Immersion can be ensured 
by the use of virtual reality headsets (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR). Contrary to some 
people’s  belief, the proper  use  of  virtual reality  headsets, with proper  training and  for reasonable 
time  periods  has  no  negative  effects  (headaches,  falls  or  dizziness)  even  for  persons  affected  by 
neurological disorders [43]. Furthermore, elder people with neurological disorders managed to use 
high-resolution  head-mounted  displays  (HMD)  without  experiencing  sickness  or  stress  [44]. 
Therefore,  Oculus  Rift  has  been  successfully  used  for  head  and  neck  rehabilitation  [45]  or  for 
diminishing upper limb motor impairment [46]. Successfully combining motion detection systems 
(i.e.,  Kinect)  with  VR  headsets  (i.e.,  Oculus  Rift)  and  using  3D  game  engines  (i.e.,  Unity  3D)  for 
creating gamified exercises can improve a person’s mobility and quality of life [47]. In terms of high 
visual  fidelity  and  the  possibility  of  full-body  tracking,  HTC  Vive  systems  come  as  a  viable 
alternative,  as  studies  show  that  their  infrared-based  motion  tracking  capability  (for  position  and 
rotation)  is  extremely  accurate  (i.e.,  errors  of  “3.97  ±  3.37  mm”  for  human  distance  traveled, 
respectively, “0.46 ± 0.46 degrees” in angle rotation with a robotic arm) [48] when compared to high-
cost motion capture systems [49]. As HTC Vive proves useful for rehabilitation, it has been used for 
lower-limb impairments in combination with motorized pedals [50]. 

Most of the papers selected for qualitative analysis show that biosensors (EEG, EMG, heart rate 
monitoring, etc.) are important in neurorehabilitation systems, for assessing different physiological 
parameters, such as brain or muscle activity during training. Electromyography (EMG) can be used 
for analyzing the degree of muscular activity when performing different VR exercises [51] or the use 
of myoelectric signals for controlling prosthetics [52]. VR rehabilitation game examples include the 
use of Microsoft Kinect and Myo gesture control armband (with EMG integrated) for treating people 
with neurological disorders [53]. Regarding EEG monitoring, this helps studying the effects of VR 
training over neural reorganization and can be used as a facilitator for a brain–computer interface 
(BCI) [54]. Studies show that BCI leads to better performances in neurorehabilitation systems if it is 
part of an immersive system [55]. 

Studies regarding the users’ opinion related to VR neurorehabilitation systems underline that 
the  key  aspects  for  a  successful  system  include  “maintaining  therapeutic  principles”,  including 
“positive  feedback”  and  “avoiding  technology  failure”  [56].  Usual  techniques  developed  for 
neurorehabilitation  in  VR  systems  include  imitation,  multiple  repetition  of  the  same  exercises, 
eventually with different levels of intensity [57]. Augmentation is often used for enhancing the user’s 
movements  or  reactions  and  impacting  their  motivation,  either  through  physical  means  (e.g., 
pneumatic gloves [58], transcranial direct current stimulation [59] or functional electrical stimulation 
[60]) or through virtual ones (e.g., enhancing the person’s movement in the virtual environment) [61]. 
In addition, systems tend to lean more and more towards home-use and tele-rehabilitation, as these 
can  influence  the  person’s  motivation,  well-being  and  desire  to  train,  offering  a  more  accessible 
solution regardless of physical impairments. Tele-rehabilitation systems allow therapists to carefully 

 
Sensors 2020, 20, 6045 

9  of  47 

monitor the  patient’s progress and  activity remotely,  for both  desktop [62] or  mobile  applications 
[63]. Tele-rehabilitation does not need to be seen as a replacement of rehabilitation centers, but rather 
as a tool which provides continuity once the patient is discharged [64]. 

To  conclude,  a  virtual  reality  neurorehabilitation  system  should  balance  costs  and  efficiency, 
allow  home-based  training  and  be  adaptable  for  a  wide  range  of  disabilities  and  situations. 
Furthermore,  biosensor  inclusion  is  mandatory,  virtual  environments  and  movements  mapping 
should be immersive enough, while gamification principles must assure motivation and feedback. 

4. Our System 

After the thorough analysis of the existing state of the art regarding neurorehabilitation systems, 
we established the neurological disorders targeted by our own system proposal: stroke, Parkinson’s 
disease  and  trauma  of  the  central  or  peripheral  nervous  system.  As  for  the  main  technology,  we 
decided  to  use  virtual  reality.  Rehabilitation  treatment  using  virtual  reality  is  based  on  many 
principles used in classical rehabilitation (e.g., performing exercises for joint mobility, executing daily 
tasks). The VR-based rehabilitation treatment is not considerably different in terms of rehabilitation 
procedures, and VR should be rather viewed as a facilitator for creating virtual environments, games, 
tasks, monitoring activity and collecting data, performing exercises at home, relieving the therapist’s 
work by making them capable of supervising more patients at once through tele-rehabilitation. 

Our  neurorehabilitation  system  enables  the  creation  of  a  wide  range  of  customizable 
rehabilitation  exercises  which  can  be  used  for  self-training  using  consumer-grade  VR  devices. 
Realism, embodiment, engagement, gamification and a sense of presence are essential for creating a 
motivating self-training environment. Gamification elements, such as score, badges, challenges and 
level  of  difficulties  are  present  to  raise  the  engagement  of  the  user.  Movement  augmentation  is 
obtained through amplifiers that help people apply less effort than normally required for performing 
a certain action (e.g., throwing a ball in a virtual scene). The goal is to help improve the quality of life 
of the people affected by the mentioned disorders by offering physical assistance and helping them 
improve  lost  or  degenerating  body  functions  and  structures  so  that  each  person  can  become  as 
independent as possible when performing daily activities. The real therapist is therefore represented 
in the virtual environment as a virtual avatar, while tasks and feedback are provided automatically 
by  the  system.  The  role  of  the  real  therapist  is  not  neglected,  as  exercises  and  sensors  data  are 
centralized on a server from which they can be accessed and interpreted by specialists. The flexibility 
of the system also makes it suitable for medical personnel, such as medicine students, interns, nurses, 
and kinesiotherapists. 
Furthermore, 

the  existing 
neurorehabilitation practices, procedures and protocols, also focusing on maintaining the suitability 
for  elder  people.  Various  virtual  scenes  and  exercises  are  designed  according  to  the  model  of  the 
International  Classification  of  Functioning,  Disability  and  Health  (ICF)  [65],  focusing  on  the 
interactions between different biopsychosocial factors [66] (p.10)—health condition, body functions 
and structure, activity, participation and contextual factors (environmental and personal). 

requirements  were  established  based  on 

the  software 

Each of the designed exercises will be detailed according to the targeted biopsychosocial factors 

in the Software components sub-chapter. 

In  addition  to  patient  suitability,  ICF  protocols  are  recommended  for  the  training  process  of 
health  professionals  as  well  [67]  (p.  46).  They  can  be  used  for  students’  education  and  medical 
personnel  training,  providing  a  standardized  framework  based  on  a  biopsychosocial  approach. 
Therefore, we consider that a VR neurorehabilitation system based on ICF protocols can improve the 
education, collaboration and dedication of health professionals [68]. 

4.1. System’s Functionalities 

INREX-VR  targets  three  main  categories  of  actors:  patients  suffering  from  a  neurological 
disorder, trainees (students, interns, residents, etc.) and therapists (responsible for supervising the 
rehabilitation of one or more patients). This system is suitable for people suffering from medium or 
low disabilities, not for those with advanced disabilities (e.g., bed bound). It can help sufferers with 

 
Sensors 2020, 20, 6045 

10  of  47 

progressive neurological disorders so that they do not arrive in an advanced stage of gravity (e.g., 
suitable until stage 3 of Parkinson’s disease) or those affected by neurological disorders so that they 
recover lost functions. 

The  main  functionalities  focus  on  patients’  training  (either  through  a  “training  tutorial”  with 
classical rehabilitation movements, performed by a virtual trainer, or through rehabilitation games) 
and on medical personnel training (they can observe classical rehabilitation movements performed 
by  the  virtual  avatar  and  practice  them  on  their  own).  All  users  can  register  when  they  use  the 
application  for the first time  and each  patient  will  have their profile connected with  their real-life 
therapist.  Additional  functionalities  which  target  the  therapist  include  the  configuration  of  the 
training session of a patient (the therapist can view the profile of a patient and specify which of the 
system’s exercises are suitable for the patient’s condition and  severity of disorder, as well as their 
levels of difficulty or level of augmentation for the movements) and evaluation of the session (the 
therapist  can  see  the  results  of  the  exercises  performed  by  the  patient,  in  terms  of  accuracy  and 
movements  performed,  as  well  as  visualize  and  interpret  the  biosensors  data).  The  emotional 
evaluation of the person during training includes heart-rate monitoring, level of stress through skin 
conductance or emotion detection through facial recognition, if the system is used without the virtual 
reality headset. 

A simplified description of the system’s main use cases is presented in Figure 4. Other external 
functionalities include the setup and calibration of the hardware devices and sensors, which can be 
done by the patients themselves in the case of at-home neurorehabilitation (if their health condition 
allows  them  and  they  have  some  technical  knowledge),  by  a  caregiver  or  a  technical  support 
specialist.

4.2. System’s Architecture 

4.2.1. Hardware Components 

11  of  47 

The  hardware  components  are  chosen  based  on  their  technical  performance,  our  previous 
experience  with  them  and  their  suitability  for  our  system’s  requirements.  The  complete  physical 
architecture is displayed in Figure 5. 

Figure 5. Hardware components of the INREX-VR system. 

The central hardware component of the application is a complete HTC Vive Cosmos Elite VR 
system, including a headset, two HTC Vive base stations, two controllers and two Vive trackers. The 
HTC Vive Cosmos Elite headset offers a combined resolution of 2880 × 1770 pixels, representing an 
“88% resolution increase” when compared to the original Vive HMDs [69]. The HTC Vive system can 
be  easily  integrated  in  Unity3D  (our  main  software  development  program)  using  the  SteamVR 
software  development  kit.  The  VR  system  requires  a  first  time  configuration  by  placing  the  base 
stations  in  opposite  corners  and  ensuring  a  minimum  area  of  tracking  of  2  m  ×  1.5  m  [70].  Our 
standard setting includes the use of Vive controllers for arm movements and Vive trackers for leg 
movements in order to ensure the tracking of all limbs, but several alternative configurations have 
been tested: controllers for arm movements and one tracker in the torso region for full upper body 
tracking, trackers for arm movements instead of controllers for allowing the fingers’ movement. Vive 
controllers ensure user input (through buttons, grip, trackpad), while both controllers and trackers 
can provide haptic output. The HTC Vive system must be connected to a high-performance PC. Our 
setup choice consisted of a high-end VR compatible PC (Intel Core™ i7-9700K 12 M Cache, up to 4.90 
GHz processor, ASUS GeForce RTX 2070 ROG STRIX GAMING O8G 8 GB GDDR6 256-bit graphics 
card, 16 Gb DDR4 3200 MHz RAM memory and GIGABYTE Z390 GAMING X motherboard). 

Biosensors analysis is essential in the field of neurorehabilitation, therefore we included another 
consumer device, the Myo gesture control armband. The device is placed on the user’s forearm, and 
includes motion sensors for establishing orientation, rotation and acceleration, as well as eight EMG 
muscles  sensors.  Myo  has  several  gestures  configured  by  default  (e.g.,  clenching  fist,  spreading 
fingers) and each patient can have their profile calibrated when using Myo for the first time, so that 
gesture recognition is mapped on their muscular profile. Myo must be connected via Bluetooth to the 

 
 
Sensors 2020, 20, 6045 

12  of  47 

PC where the INREX-VR system is configured and can be integrated in Unity3D and Matlab with 
available software development kits (SDK). The armband can provide haptic feedback as well, with 
different levels of intensity. 

As  the  patient’s  comfort  and  emotions  must  be  monitored  during  the  use  of  the  INREX-VR 
system, we considered the integration of a Shimmer device for future tests, for monitoring the level 
of stress through skin conductance. For now, the heart rate is monitored using commercially available 
smart  bracelets  or  smart  watches.  The  Mi  fit  3  fitness  bracelet  used  in  our  system  uses  the 
photoplethysmography  (PPG)  technique  to  determine  the  heart  rate  and  other  health  parameters 
(oxygen saturation, effort levels) with the help of proprietary algorithms. PPG is a popular technique 
among health monitoring devices, as it is inexpensive, non-invasive and often uses a green LED light 
source  which  emits  light  towards  the  person’s  skin.  Green  color  is  preferred  as  it  reaches  deeper 
through the tissue and a photodetector  measures the amount of the reflected light to calculate the 
blood volume changes [71]. 

If the patient feels discomfort or is reluctant to use the VR headset, the INREX-VR offers also a 
lighter, limited version of use, as the gamified exercises targeting the upper limb are configured to 
work also just with Myo armband as a tracking device. In this case, emotion monitoring is ensured 
also by the emotion recognition software module which is described in Section 4.7. The simplified 
system for non-VR use is presented in Figure 6.

4.2.2. Software Components 

Virtual  reality  is  be  useful  for  the  field  of  neurorehabilitation,  as  it  can  allow  the  creation  of 
various  rehabilitation  exercises  through  3D  environments,  ensure  remote  supervision  from  the 
therapist  and  encourage  self-training,  if  it  is  sufficiently  motivating.  Motivation  can  be  achieved 
through gamification, embodiment and usefulness of the designed scenes.

4.3. Avatars Animations 

4.3.1. Real Time User’s Avatar Animation 

Studies analyzing the feeling of embodiment in VR environments date as far back as 1997 [72] 
and they underline the creation of a so-called “cyborg” connection—if the sense of presence is high 
enough in the virtual scene, the human mind can adapt more easily, creating a strong bond with the 
virtual environment. On the other hand, unnatural aspects in the virtual environment—unrealistic 
physics, unnatural body movement, inaccuracy between real gestures and those displayed in VR—
can  lead  to  detachment  and  lack  of  concentration.  These  aspects  are  essential  for  self-training  VR 
systems, where people need to be engaged, stimulated and immersed in order to have a continuous, 
sustained training process. 

The  lack  of  consumer-grade  full-body  trackers  has  often  led  to  compromises—VR  games  for 
instance usually show just the hand of the player rather than the whole upper limb in order to avoid 
any animation issue or decrease in embodiment. Many VR systems simulating body movements used 
expensive motion-capture sensors, but fortunately, the latest advancement in the field of consumer 
VR devices combined with inverse kinematics (IK) principles can lead to the successful creation of 
accessible and accurate simulations [73]. Inverse kinematics is highly used in robotics, from industrial 
robots to exoskeletons used in rehabilitation. This represents the process of calculating joint angles 
only from the coordinates of the end effector [74]. For instance, moving the hand will subsequently 
change the position and the rotation of the elbow and shoulder accordingly, in a natural manner. For 
achieving  this  with  a  VR  avatar,  the  3D  model  has  to  contain  a  skeleton  which  can  be  used  for 
representing the kinematic chain from Figure 8.

Figure 8. Avatar skeleton and relevant joints (left) and full-body kinematic chain (right). 

In order to ensure the immersion and embodiment in the neurorehabilitation scenes, the user 
can visualize their virtual body from a first-person perspective. Using IK-based animations for the 
first-person  avatar,  the  recovery  person  can  see  in  their  VR  headset,  in  real  time,  the  movements 
executed with their upper and lower limbs, or their head rotation. We achieve the inverse kinematics 
animations of the upper and lower limbs using Unity’s prototype Animation Rigging tool [75]. We 
create the animations in a similar way for lower and upper limbs, based on the skeleton hierarchy 
displayed  in  Figure  8.  Each  animation  of  an  individual  limb  is  a  rig  based  on  a  two-bone  IK 
constraint—root  bone  (arm/upper  leg),  middle  bone  (forearm/lower  leg)—controlled  by  the  end-
effectors (hand/foot). The appropriate transform pivots are placed in the two most important joints 
(e.g., wrist or ankle, where the sensors will be placed, and elbow or knee, the middle node used for 
computations). Basic IK principles are not sufficient, as the human body does not behave as robotic 
arms and additional constraints are needed (e.g., pronation and supination rotate both the wrist and 
forearm together, the wrist cannot be rotated individually with an angle higher than a threshold, etc.). 
Therefore, additional constraints were added for yaw, pitch and roll angles, based on testing basic 
gestures  (circular  feet  motions,  flexion/extension,  deviations  and  so  on),  and  we  added  twisting 
corrections for the elbow/hip joint to maintain natural movement. We also added animations to make 
sure  that  the  body  rotates  and  moves  with  the  head,  in  order  to  ensure  realism  in  every  scenario 
(when our sensors are placed only on the head and limbs, and not on the torso). The final step was 
mapping the Vive sensors-based components to the rig effectors. This mapping includes the pairing 
of  the  camera-headset  with  the  head  pivot,  controllers  to  the  wrist  pivots  and  trackers  to  the  feet 
pivots. Offset values can  be  configured from the  system’s interface, for both position and rotation 
transforms, so that we can ensure the customization of the animations.

4.3.2. Therapist’s Avatar Animations 

When  performing  the  tutorial  rehabilitation  exercises,  the  user  must  imitate  the  movements 
performed  by  the  virtual  therapist.  We  concluded  that  having  an  animated  therapist  avatar  can 
increase motivation and entertainment for the user, therefore, we used the same hardware system for 
recording  the  exercises  performed  correctly  by  a  real  physician,  which  is  part  of  the  system’s 
development team. With the help of the previously described IK system and the sensors attached on 
the real joints mapped on the therapist avatar’s joints, we recorded all the transform changes (position 
and  rotation)  occurring  at  each  frame  in  each  one  of  the  joints.  All  recorded  frames  are  therefore 
combined in a single animation clip which can later be attached on any avatar with the same skeleton 
rig  [76].  The  correspondence  between  the  real  movements  performed  by  the  therapist  and  the 
resulting animation of the  virtual avatar can be observed in Figure 9. The exercises are performed 
firstly with each limb at the time and at the end with both limbs together (in the case of the upper 
limb).

All  recorded  tutorial  exercises  were  chosen  based  on  usual  neurorehabilitation  procedures 
applied for the targeted disorders [15] (pp. 29–54), in collaboration with physicians. We describe them 
more thoroughly in the following subchapter. Furthermore, the same recording module can be used 
by the patient during their own training sessions, if they want to see them later or send them to the 
therapist for visual reference. 

4.4. VR Training Exercises Execution 

As people are often new to VR as a technology, a tutorial is needed for helping them get used to 
the INREX-VR system. This is the first purpose of the VR training exercises module, as it contains 
basic  exercises  (for  upper/lower  limb),  which  are  performed  by  the  animated  avatar  and  must  be 
imitated  by the  user. The exercises  were inspired by  and are similar  to  classical exercises  used by 
therapists  in  face-to-face  neurorehabilitation  processes,  yet  they  are  displayed  in  a  virtual 
environment as executed by trainers and imitated by users through self-training. Each of the exercises 
is summarized in Table 4 according to their ICF biopsychosocial factors [65] and described in more 
details below. The environmental factors of all the exercises refer to the use of a technological product, 
for clinical or personal use.

The tutorial exercises can be performed in two distinct environments: a nature setting, where 
the avatar that exemplifies the exercises is a fitness coach, and a rehabilitation center, where the avatar 
is a physician. The implementation of the two environments has the purpose of verifying if a relaxed 
natural environment, with no obvious connection to a rehabilitation setting, can make the users more 
comfortable, motivated and dedicated during training [77]. 

All exercises must be performed as in a “mirror”—e.g., when the avatar executes the movement 
with their right arm, the user must execute it with their left arm. All exercises are shortly described 
based  on  the  conventions  used  for  the  spatial  position  and  the  anatomic  planes  and  sections  [78], 
applied on our avatar’s reference position (Figure 10). The values provided are corresponding to the 
highest degree of mobility of that particular joint (not affected) and will be used for the automatic 
evaluation  of  movements.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  number  of  repetitions  can  be  viewed  more 
important than the precision, so people are encouraged to perform the exercises regardless of their 
mobility level. Furthermore, precision classes are important only for the testing procedure chapter, 
for data collection and research purposes only, if they are not displayed to the user during training. 
For  the  user,  only  information  related  to  scores,  time  or  challenges  are  important,  as  they  can 
contribute to increasing their motivation and training will.

Elbow joint exercises—Figure 12:

Extension/flexion of the forearm—starting position with the arms by the patient’s side, palms 
facing upward (supination); the forearm should be flexed so that the elbow joint reaches at least 
145° (up to 160°) (in the sagittal plane). The extension is represented by bringing the forearm to 
the initial position (elbow angle 0°); 
Pronation/supination of the forearm—supination and pronation are rotational movements in the 
transversal plane (along the longitudinal axis of the limb), supination representing the upwards 
movement of the palm, and pronation the downward movement [15] (p. 41). The movement is 
performed  from  0°  to  90°  (supination),  respectively,  from  0°  to  −90°  (pronation),  the  neutral 
position  being  the  one  with  the  arms  oriented  and  fully  stretched  forward,  with  the  thumb 
oriented upwards;

the hands close to the chest and the forearm oriented horizontally so that the elbow joint forms 
an angle of approximately 90° in flexion, a pushing motion is made towards the ground until 
the forearm is fully extended (elbow joint angle becomes 0°); 

•  Arm pushing (front)—training both elbow and fist joints; from a relaxed position, with hands 
raised at the shoulder level and the forearm oriented vertically (hands close to face), a forward 
pushing  movement  is  performed  until  the  forearm  is  perfectly  extended  (elbow  joint  angle 
becomes 0°), and the fist joint is at least 60° in extension in the sagittal plane.

Fist extension (Figure 13a)—with the arms stretched forward, from a pronation position, the fist 
joint must be rotated from 0° to 70° in the sagittal plane; 
Fist  adduction  (Figure  13b)—similar  with  the  waving  gesture;  from  the  extension  position 
presented in the previous exercise, the joint must be adducted with a maximum of 50°–55° in the 
frontal plane (exterior rotation). 

General upper limb exercises (force, coordination): 

Spinning  wheel—classical  exercise  especially  for  Parkinson’s  disease,  where  the  movement 
coordination  is  tested.  The  initial  position  is  the  same  from  the  “arm  pushing  (downwards)” 
presented  previously.  The  symmetry  of  the  execution  of  the  movements  is  evaluated  (the 
successive rotation transforms of the arm joints must have comparable values), so that the joint 
of each elbow forms an angle of at least 45° in the sagittal plane throughout the movement; the 
physical resistance is measured (for how long can the user execute the exercise without losing 
focus or coordination); 
Boxing training (jab punches) (Figure 13c)—this exercise aims to train the user for the boxing 
game  (Section  4.5),  with  the  most  basic  movement  of  this  sport—the  jab  punch.  The  starting 
position is similar to that of the exercise entitled “arm pushing (front)”, but the hand is relaxed 
or with a clenched fist, not in extension. The user must make a pushing movement towards an 
imaginary  adversary,  at  chest  or  face  level,  with  each  arm  at  the  time,  until  the  forearm  is 
perfectly extended; when one arm is pushed forward, the other returns to the neutral position 
(“guard”); the physical resistance (the time of repetition of the hits without interruption) and the 
speed of the hits are evaluated.

Exercises for the lower limb (Figure 14) are exemplified by the trainer standing up, but most of 
them can be performed by the patient when lying down (on the back or on the side), if their physical 
condition does not allow them to stand up. 
Hip joint exercises (whole lower limb): 

•  Hip flexion (0–90°)—the lower limb should be raised forward, keeping it perfectly stretched so 

that the hip joint approaches 90° in the sagittal plane; 

•  Hip abduction—the lower limb must be raised to the side, keeping it perfectly stretched so that 
the hip joint approaches 45° in the frontal plane; the patient’s pelvis must remain still and not 
tilt to the opposite side.

Knee joint exercises: 

20  of  47 

•  Knee flexion (forward)—the lower limb should be raised forward, with the knee flexed in the 

sagittal plane; 

•  Knee  flexion  (backward)—the  previous  exercise  can  be  executed  also  with  the  lower  limb 
oriented  backwards;  both  movements  should  consist  of  at  least  75°–80°  knee  rotation  in  the 
sagittal plane. 

Ankle joint exercises: 

•  Ankle flexion/extension—similar to a “toe stand” followed by “heel stand”; standing on toes is 
equivalent  to  an  extension  of  about  45°  in  the  sagittal  plane;  the  flexion  is  represented  by 
returning to the initial position, with a slight bend on the heels (maximum 20°).

4.5. Training in VR Games 

The second part of the neurorehabilitation process of a patient involves training in different VR 
games.  The  users must follow the  verbal or  written indications  and apply the moves learnt  in  the 
tutorial for accomplishing gamified tasks. These activities focus on adding fun,  gamified elements 
(score,  levels  of  difficulty,  challenges  and  badges),  for  motivating  the  patient  to  continue  the 
rehabilitation process. All VR games are assessed based on their ICF characteristics, as presented in 
Table  5.  Furthermore,  the  gamified  exercises  help  the  user  train  complex  skills  needed  for  daily 
activities and require the same movements: e.g., picking up a ball and raising it to launch it requires 
the same action as picking up a glass to drink. 

The gamified rehabilitation exercises are providing multimodal feedback: visual (virtual reality 
environments where real-world movements are mapped accordingly), haptic (impulses provided by 
the hardware devices for simulating physical contact in the games, applied on the targeted limb) and 
auditory (music, verbal tasks and hints, jingles).

Upper limb exercises 
The upper limb exercises include carnival games (where therapeutic movements are performed 
in gamified settings) and boxing, great for both rehabilitation and maintaining good physical shape. 

•  Hit targets—picking up a ball and throwing it to hit a tower of cans. The exercises of shoulder 
flexion–extension  (0°–180°)  from  the  tutorial  are  practiced  now,  as  well  as  actions  of 
grabbing/releasing of objects. The actions are performed in a very natural manner. Clenching 
the fist will activate the controller’s grab buttons, respectively, Myo’s specific gesture, for picking 
up a ball; the user must lift their arm and launch the ball at a certain speed; by releasing the grab 
buttons/unclenching the fist, the ball will be launched. Various levels of difficulty are obtained 
through  different  a  number  of  hit  targets  or  different  distances  between  the  player  and  the 
targets. Picking up the ball is simulated through vibrations (from the controller or the armband). 
Ball directing—a ball must be directed on a table which has a ramp at its end and land in holes 
with different scores. This game practices movements of the elbow from the tutorial, and a new 
ball  will  be  generated  in  the  person’s  hand,  which  is  the  grip  buttons  of  the  controller  being 
pressed. Similar launching actions are performed when the grip buttons are released. Difficulty 

• 

 
Sensors 2020, 20, 6045

is varied through the maximum number of available balls or through the distance between the 
player  and  the  table’s  end.  Picking  up  the  ball  is  simulated  through  vibrations  (from  the 
controller or the armband). 

•  Whack-a-mole—the user must hit as many moles as they can using a hammer, in 60 s. Both hand 
and elbow tutorial movements are being trained. The HTC Vive scenario includes the use of a 3 
×  3  matrix  of  moles.  Various  difficulty  levels  are  obtained  by  changing  the  moles’  spawning 
frequency  and  the  duration  until  they  are  “hiding”  back  in  their  holes.  Hitting  a  mole  is 
simulated through vibrations (from the controller or the armband). 
Boxing—the  user  must  perform  different  boxing  techniques  (guard,  jab,  cross  punch,  hook, 
uppercut), as performed by a virtual trainer. There are two scenarios—in a boxing ring with a 
mannequin and in front of a punching bag (heavier than the mannequin). The score is calculated 
based on the number of punches thrown in one minute. The contact with the target is simulated 
through vibrations (from the controller or the armband). 

• 

The upper limb exercises are also implemented to be used in a simplified manner without the 
HTC Vive system (in special situations when the user feels uncomfortable when using the headset or 
if  the  person  only  has  access  to  limited  hardware  devices  from  the  system).  In  this  situation,  the 
setting is adapted to be used with the Myo armband and actions are triggered based on the gestures 
performed with it (clenching fist for picking up objects, spreading fingers for releasing them, left only 
right movement of arm for hitting left–right targets and so on). The difference in perspective for the 
non-VR and VR scenarios, respectively, can be seen in Figure 15. For the whack-a-mole exercise, there 
are only three moles in the non-VR scenario, as the armband cannot track depth movements of the 
arm, so the moles are displayed on one row and must be hit by performing left–right translations.

Lower limb exercises 
Initially, the gamified rehabilitation exercises developed in our system with the animated avatar 
integrated  included  basic  physiotherapy  movements  (for  upper/lower  limb)  and  games  such  as 
picking up a ball and throwing it to hit targets, ball directing games, coordination games (whack-a-
mole), boxing, or slowly walking in virtual environments. However, walking in VR can cause motion 
sickness without proper training or for people who are new to this technology, and preliminary tests 
with people not familiar to using VR  showed that they feel discomfort and/or dizziness when the 
walking action from the real world is mapped similarly into the virtual one. This is why we changed 
our lower limb exercises and games, so that they focus more on the flexion/extension of the limb (e.g., 
football, dancing game—both done with the person standing in one fixed spot) rather than walking 
for long distances. 

 
Sensors 2020, 20, 6045 

23  of  47 

• 

Football—ball  shooting  to  hit  the  goal  from  a  fixed  position.  All  lower  limb  joints  are  being 
trained. Various degrees of difficulty include varying the distance to the goal (e.g., penalty, free 
kick), with or without a goalkeeper or a wall and hitting from a central or lateral position. Hitting 
the ball is simulated through vibrations of the tracker. 

•  Dancing—similar to the “arcade dancing games”. All lower limb joints are being trained. The 
user must touch colorful squares on the floor that are being lit in the rhythm of the music, as 
shown on an arcade screen. Different songs need different speeds of performing the steps and 
vary the difficulty. 

Because realism and attention to detail can have a major impact on user motivation, efficiency 
and dedication, the scenes were designed with great attention to the graphics, avoiding elements that 
can diminish the user’s  immersion. For  example, when using the Myo armband without the HTC 
Vive system (and as a result seeing only the avatar’s arms, without the rest of the body), a separate 
camera is used for permanently rendering the arms, as they should not pass through walls or other 
non-relevant objects that the user should not collide with (e.g., tables, arcade machines). The lighting 
of  the  static  objects  is  realized  in  Unity’s  “baked”  mode,  to  be  calculated  before  runtime  and  not 
dynamically in each frame (thus improving performance, which is essential for a VR application). 
Improved graphic effects are obtained by post-processing (Figure 16)—effects such as vignette, fog, 
ambient occlusion, depth of field, and color changes on RGB channels, with some of them deactivated 
in the case of VR (e.g., the vignette is visually pleasant on computer screens but can be tiring for the 
eyes on a headset).

4.6. Adaptive Learning Algorithm 

Adaptive learning is essential in a self-training application or distance learning system [79]. For 
keeping people motivated and encouraging them to self-improve, we decided that the games should 
include an adaptive learning algorithm which includes all gamified exercises. Each game starts with 
a  neutral  task  (medium  level  of  difficulty)  and  based  on  the  user’s  performance,  the  adaptive 
algorithm will determine the next level which should be performed by the user. Adaptive elements 
include varying the number of targets or the distance between the user and the targets (hitting cans, 
directing  balls),  spawning  frequency  and  hitting  time  window  (whack-a-mole),  ball  position—
centered  or  on  a  side—and  distance  to  the  goal  (football),  force  required  (all  exercises)  or  demos 
shown by a trainer (boxing). 

The adaptive learning concept is summarized in Figure 17, including the three main levels of 
difficulty and variations which can appear at each individual level, with examples taken from the 
games.  The  current  version  of  the  adaptive  learning  algorithm  takes  only  one  parameter  in 
consideration (e.g., distance) and will be further developed to include all aspects mentioned in this 
subchapter.

4.7. Session Configuration, Evaluation and Data Collection 

For starting a training session without a configuration from the therapist (i.e., if the system is 
used for the training of the medical personnel), tutorial exercises or games can be selected from the 
menu where they are grouped based on their targeted limb and/or joint. Session configuration can be 
personalized for the user’s profile, by selecting the most suitable exercises for their disorder or degree 
of impairment either from the Unity application (useful for clinical use or medical training) or from 
a mobile application. Different parameters can be customized, such as the number of repetitions to 
be performed, the training duration, as well as the force that the user must apply for succeeding in a 
game (this parameter is controlled through a force amplifier which must have greater values for more 
serious  impairments,  thus  assuring  movement  augmentation).  If  the  therapist  recommends 
performing  only  one  specific  level  of  difficulty,  they  can  manually  disable  the  adaptive  learning 
algorithm and set their desired level. 

In  addition  to  getting  used  to  the  system,  each  exercise  in  the  tutorial  has  the  role  of 
automatically evaluating the degree of mobility at the level of each joint. Thus, in each exercise, the 
maximum angle reached after performing the movement is analyzed, respectively the position of the 
relevant limb subdivision, based on mobility coefficients. The movements recorded by the therapist 
based on specialized rehabilitation treaties [15] are considered to have the ideal values accepted and 
the system calculates the deviation  of  the  movements performed by the user from these standard 
values. We therefore obtain a score of the exercise and can approximate the functional deficit of one 
or more joints. Each position/rotation evaluation is done according to the local coordinate system of 
each joint, respecting the previously mentioned conventions related to the spatial position and the 
orientation planes of the human body (e.g., for the left shoulder joint as shown in Figure 18, the axes 
are represented as follows: Ox—red, Oy—green and Oz—blue; an abduction/adduction movement 
of the shoulder, i.e., lateral lifting arms, will require a rotation around the Oy axis). Other data are 
also automatically computed by the system, such as the number of hits/score, the time of execution, 
and the speed of movement/force.

Relevant data, including game parameters and performance, movements and biosensors data 
are being saved locally and sent to a Firebase Realtime Database server through a Unity REST API 
[80]. They can be accessed from the same server by the therapist through their mobile application, in 
order to see the patient’s results and progress and change their exercises’ configuration accordingly. 
Emotion-related data are also saved in the same database (heart-rate values or emotions, in the case 
of non-VR use of the system). For detecting emotions through the facial expressions captured by the 
webcam, we used the RAGE (Realising an Applied Gaming “Emotion Detection Asset” created by 
the Open University of the Netherlands [81] which is capable of identifying the six basic emotions: 
happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, and anger [82] or if the user is having a neutral expression. 

5. Preliminary Results and Discussion 

5.1. Testing Procedure 

A preliminary laboratory testing study was conducted as a validation procedure, including six 
healthy subjects (Users 1–6). All healthy subjects from the first stage of testing were involved in the 
creation of the project as part of the development team or as physicians consulted for designing the 
exercises and establishing the functionalities of the system. According to clinical trials procedures, it 
was mentioned by the World Health Organization and the American National Institute of Health that 
testing a new drug, vaccine or medical device needs an “initial safety evaluation in healthy adults” 
[83].  These  healthy  volunteers  helped  collect  the  data  needed  in  studies  for  comparison,  also 
facilitating the development of new knowledge or the improvement of system functionalities [84]. 
Besides the definition of “normal” parameters (e.g., scores in rehabilitation games), tests with healthy 
subjects  help  assess  the  possible  risks  caused  by  virtual  reality  so  that  we  can  establish  risk 
management  strategies before testing  the  system  with patients  (e.g., side  effects  caused  by virtual 
reality,  a  lack  of  comfort  of  devices,  a  lack  of  relevance  or  appropriateness  of  exercises)  [85].  The 
second step of the testing studies included two elder patients suffering from neurological disorders, 
who tested a simplified version of the INREX-VR system (without the HTC Vive), testing all games 
for  the  upper  limb  and  all  training  exercises  for  both  upper  and  lower  limb.  These  two  users  are 
further referred as User 7 and User 8. Our future step of testing, after performing all improvements 
underlined  from  these  two  preliminary  tests,  includes  the  use  of  the  complete  VR  system  with  a 
higher number of patients. Unfortunately, the advancement of the testing phase is impossible at the 
moment, as we were not able to have access to patients in hospitals or rehabilitation centers in the 
past 6 months because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in our country. 

All test subjects provided their informed consent (Supplementary Materials S1_Patient-consent-
form). before starting the study and all protocols from the Declaration of Helsinki were respected. 
The overview of the test subjects can be observed in Table 6, including their self-expressed levels of 
technological and VR experience (skills) before testing the INREX-VR system, based on a five-point

Likert  scale  (i.e.,  excellent,  good,  fair,  low,  very  low).  The  level  of  physical  activity  is  appreciated 
based on the “Saltin–Grimby Physical Activity Level Scale” (inactive, light physical activity, regular

The VR system setup presented in Section 4.2.1 was used for all healthy participants (Users 1–
6). As VR components, User 4 used only the HTC Vive headset and upper limb controllers, without 
leg trackers. The HTC Vive headset was connected with the PC via cable, but the person assisting the 
testing procedures made sure it did not have any negative impact on the user’s experience (as the 
cable and testing zones were spacious enough). A high-end configuration allowed us to present the 
system to the user with the highest graphics quality  settings of the 3D scenes without any latency 
issues,  allowing  us  the  recording  process  of  some  training  procedures  at  the  same  time.  The  tests 
were conducted under the same conditions, with only one exception: when the health condition did 
not allow them to perform the exercises while standing up, the users were allowed to perform all 
exercises sitting down. Otherwise, the conditions are the same for all VR test subjects: same laboratory 
setting (same room, surface, light conditions, temperature), same software exercises mentioned in the 
procedure,  same  VR  setup  (headset,  controllers  for  hand  and  trackers  for  feet).  For  the  two  users 
suffering from neurological disorders, the testing took place at the users’ personal residence, with the 
non-VR version of the system (laptop and Myo gesture control armband, plus emotional evaluation 
from the facial expressions using the webcam). 

The testing procedure consisted of four main phases: phase 0 (accommodation—filling consent 
form, measuring health parameters, presenting, configuring and getting used to the system), phase 1 
(training exercises—one or two representative exercises for each one of the joints, performed one at 
a time, saving the maximum joint rotation values in text files and recording the training sequences as 
an  animations  clip  so  that  they  can  be  re-watched  and  analyzed  in  detail);  phase  2  (games—four 
upper limb games and one lower limb performed for 3 min, either adaptively in one long trial or with 
predefined levels of difficulties, in three distinct trials; scores and system mentions saved in text files); 
phase 3 (final feedback—answering a questionnaire with different aspects related to the use of the 
system). During the training phases of the procedure (phases 1 and 2 below), parameters such as the 
heart  rate  and  EMG  were  continuously  monitored.  EMG  datasets  from  the  patients  are  grouped 
based  on 
the  exercises  performed  and  are  available  as  Supplementary  Materials 
(S2_CompleteUserTestingData).  Table  7  describes  in  detail  each  one  of  the  phases  in  terms  of 
purpose, activities and performance measurements.

5.2. Synthetic Results 

29  of  47 

For each one of the training exercises from phase 1, we calculated the average angle across all 
trials for each user’s right/left limb, respectively, and we evaluated the range of motion degree (ROM) 
of each limb, as well as the execution time of each exercise (for both right and left limb together), for 
the  upper  body  (Table  8)  and  lower  body  (Table  9),  respectively.  The  range  of  motion  degree 
evaluation  was  established  with  the  help  of  physicians,  based  on  mobility  coefficients  used  in 
rehabilitation treaties [15] (pp. 33–34). We thus established a five-point Likert scale which is further 
described in Appendix A, Table A1 and includes the following marks: excellent (5), good (4), fair (3), 
poor (2), very poor (1). For personal health reasons, User 4 only executed the upper limb exercises 
which were performed while sitting down. Individual data collected at each trial for each user can be 
found  in  the  Supplementary  Materials  (S2_CompleteUserTestingData,  Tables  Table_User1  – 
Table_User8). 

According to the statistics, users performed best in the shoulder category, obtaining very good 
and good ROM results. For the fist exercises, the results were the lowest, partially because holding 
the  Vive  controllers  limits  the  hand’s  range  of  motion  to  a  certain  extent  and  prevents  finger 
extension. Further tests are required using also trackers for hands, similar to the ones used for feet. 
The  use  of  trackers  can  also  solve  the  elbow  supination  abnormality—normally,  the  movement  is 
restricted to 90° by musculoskeletal reasons, and values that are higher (e.g., User 2 and User 5 in 
Table 8) are obtained by involuntarily rotating the controller independently from the fist joint (i.e., 
rotating the device but keeping the hand still). From the average values table, as well as the detailed 
trial  recordings  (Supplementary  Materials  S3_RecordingAnimations),  we  can  observe  that  some 
exercises were performed at a higher angle than required (e.g., User 4 has an average angle of 109.4° 
for the right arm, and 108.6° for the left arm in the shoulder flexion exercise, even though they were 
asked to perform a 90° movement). In this particular case, a higher angle was translated as a very 
good  level  of  mobility,  but  the  lack  of  proprioception  can  be  caused  by  the  fact  of  not  being 
accustomed with the first person perspective from a virtual world. The user must be therefore helped 
and messages should be displayed on screen when a movement was correctly performed.

Table 9 shows that all users obtained very good and good results across all lower limb exercises. 
The performance is overall better than the one obtained for upper limb exercises, showing that Vive 
trackers are more suitable as they are kept in a fixed position on the user’s foot  (shoe) and do not 
restrict  the  movements  in  any  way.  The  ankle  flexion  exercise  obtained  the  lowest  performance 
scores, partially because users were asked to have the trackers fixed on their shoes and their rigidity 
can limit ankle flexion. Special foot straps for the trackers can allow them to be placed directly on the 
person’s foot for better ankle freedom. 

Similar  tests  were  performed  with  two  users  suffering  from  neurological  pathologies:  User  7 
with  diabetic  neuropathy  and  User  8  with  stroke.  They  followed  the  same  testing  procedure,  but 
tested the non-VR version of the system. Since this version does not allow the automatic evaluation 
of the classical training exercises (as it does not use the HTC Vive sensors), we measured them only 
manually using the goniometer and focused on the number of repetitions performed by the users. 
They performed the exercises in a sitting position, therefore the hip abduction exercise was skipped 
(must be performed standing up or laying on one side). One of the phenomena observed during the 
tests was that the users were obviously ambitioned to perform the exercises as well as possible—User 
7 had difficulties in performing day-to-day tasks and had severe hand trembling when picking up 
objects or lifting them. However, they were concentrating better when performing the exercises of 
the system and obtained better results than expected for both upper limb (Table 10) and lower limb 
exercises  (Table  11).  For  the  elbow  supination/pronation  exercise,  we  displayed  the  results  of  the 
supination/pronation for the right arm on one row, and those of the left arm on the next row.

We observe that in the case of non-healthy users, the numerical evaluation is better for unitary 
exercises  (e.g.,  fist  extension)  rather  than  for  complex  ones  (e.g.,  arm  pushing).  For  instance,  arm 
pushing  and  fist  extension  focus  on  the  same  joint  evaluation  (fist  joint),  but  in  the  case  of  arm 
pushing,  the  movement  is  more  complex,  requiring  more  movements  performed  simultaneously 
(arm  stretching,  elbow  extension)  and  patients  tend  to  concentrate  on  performing  the  complex 
movement  correctly  rather  than  having  a  high  fist  joint  angle.  This  can  occur  because  of  the 
deterioration of neurological functions with ageing which can affect concentration and multitasking 
capabilities [87]. In rehabilitation procedures, the time of execution is less important than the action 
of performing with success all the repetitions of an exercise which can further lead to the recovery of 
a lost function. Therefore, each one of the users was asked to perform the exercises at their own pace, 
with  the  difference  in  the  execution  time  (Tables  8–11)  being  mostly  related  to  the  age  or  sex 
differences  (e.g.,  younger  people  have  usually  better  joint  mobility  and  were  able  to  perform  the 
exercises faster, males have usually poorer lower limb mobility than females and therefore executed 
lower limb exercises slower). These aspects are, however, not very relevant for our system, as there 
is no need to oblige the users to perform the exercises at a certain speed, and they should concentrate 
on performing them correctly and with the required number of repetitions. 

For determining the accuracy related to the system’s evaluation of the healthy user’s movements 
in the training tutorial, the real angles of joints were measured using a goniometer mobile application 
[88] and compared with the values registered by the system. One measurement was performed with 
the goniometer at the beginning of each exercise, with each one of the users, and compared with the 
same trial as registered by the system. The accuracy for each measurement and the average accuracy 
for each exercise can be found in Table 12 for the upper limb and Table 13 for the lower limb.

The average accuracy obtained across all upper and lower limb exercises was of 95.59%, showing 

great potential for future developments and use with neurorehabilitation patients. 

For phase 2 of the testing  procedure, we  analyzed the performance obtained by each healthy 
user based on the score from each one of the trials, for each game (Table 14). For consistency reasons, 
we established a similar five-point Likert scale, with each grade described according to each game 
and  difficulty  level  in  Appendix  A,  Table  A2.  Hit  targets  is  the  only  exercise  where  we  kept  the 
adaptive algorithm to see the highest level of difficulty reached by a user; all other games included 
three  individual  trials  of  one  minute  each.  For  personal  health  reasons,  User  4  only  executed  the 
games  which  targeted  the  upper  limb.  A  detailed  score  for  each  user  can  be  consulted  in  the 
Supplementary Materials (S2_CompleteUserTestingData, Tables Table_User1 – Table_User8).

* User 4 performed only upper limb games for personal health reasons. 

The games which had the best results among all users and all trials were boxing, ball directing 
and whack-a-mole. Boxing and whack-a-mole required more basic movements (arm movement when 
holding the controller, without interacting with its input) and were easier to understand and use by 
all users, regardless of their level of experience with technology. The “hit targets” game required a 
more complex movement (clenching fist to press the controller’s grip buttons for picking up the ball, 
raising  arm,  coordinating  the  grip  release  moment  to  launch  the  ball  in  the  right  direction)  and

therefore  required  more  accommodation  time.  The  football  game  would  benefit  from  the 
personalization of the user’s avatar based on their height and lower limb dimensions. 

In Figure 19, the column chart shows for each game and each trial the users’ performance, in 
terms of their obtained grades. Trial 3 of the Ball directing game had the best results (five users with 
excellent performance, one user with good performance), while the first penalty trial of the football 
game had the worst results (three users with fair performance and two users with good performance). 
All games have a 100% accuracy (recorded data compared with self-assessment or observation from 
the supervisor/trainer—e.g., number of collisions with the punching bag, number of cans hit).

games and trials. 

Virtual reality and technology experience have no impact on the users’ accuracy in the classical 
training exercises. User 6, despite their lack of VR experience and only fair technology experience, 
performed good and very good in all training exercises, both classical and gamified. User 6 had great 
performance in all gamified exercises. If we compare the performances in relation to the user’s age, 
we can thus observe that they are not correlated, as people of all ages can perform well in all games. 
It should be noted that User 6 has a history of playing professional handball in their youth. 

In the case of non-VR training with people affected by neurological disorders, the Myo armband 
was not able to detect with a high accuracy the “clenching fist” gesture as input for game actions (e.g., 
picking up a ball). This caused frustration, as the user was able to pick up the ball occasionally, but 
Myo was detecting their fist release earlier, resulting in the ball dropping without throwing it towards 
the targets. A redesign is thus needed for games which require this gesture (i.e., hitting targets, ball 
directing) in the case of the non-VR system setting. We obtained better gesture detection in the case 
of  hand  waving  which  can be used as  a replacement, or  we can take  into consideration  the value 
provided by the peak to peak amplitude levels detected from the EMG sensors for upper forearm 
muscles. The boxing and whack-a-mole games were successfully performed by Users 7 and 8, as they 
required only rotation and direction input from the Myo armband. Coordination and lower reaction 
times  in  the  case  of  non-healthy  subjects  show  the  importance  of  adapting  the  exercises  to  their 
pathology  magnitude,  as  standard  configurations  lead  to  low  accuracies  (whack  a  mole—16.9% 
average accuracy for User 7, 27.13% average accuracy for User 8). On the other hand, boxing seems 
to be an exercise suitable and pleasant for all users, regardless of their health condition—Users 7 and 
8 obtained mostly good and very good boxing scores according to Table A2 (Annex 1) classification. 
Heart  rate was monitored  continuously during the  training procedure in  order  to  analyze its 
impact on the person’s effort levels. Table 15 shows the initial pulse of each user (when resting, in 
phase 0), the maximum pulse reached during training, the medium pulse across all training exercises 
as well as effort levels (relaxed, low or intense), as percentages of the training session.

* User 4, User 7 and User 8 performed the tests sitting. 

For Users 4, 7 and 8, we observe that the effort level was the lowest, with more than 98% of the 
training being performed at relaxed heart rate levels. As these users were performing the exercises 
while sitting, yet still obtaining good results during training, we can conclude that the system can be 
successfully used by people that cannot perform at high effort because of their health condition. 

For all users, we collected EMG data sent by the Myo gesture control armband via Bluetooth at 
200 Hz (Supplementary Materials S4_EMG). All data were collected on the eight individual channels 
corresponding to the eight sensors of Myo (Figure 20). Data were  grouped based on the exercises 
performed by each user, varying between 2500 and 16,000 EMG signal output values per exercise. 
The signal was normalized by default in the -128, 127 range and as shown by Nasri et al., it can be 
further interpreted by using the window method to select relevant data regions, classified by the use 
of neural networks to identify hand movements and gestures [89]. As underlined by Slutter et al., the 
action of “squeezing” tensions the upper muscles in the forearm corresponds to the EMG0, EMG1 
and EMG7 sensors [90]. As the exercise was performed while “squeezing” the HTC Vive controller, 
higher amplitude (peak-to-peak) values can be observed for these three specific sensors in Figure 20.

5.3. Feedback and Future Improvements 

In  our  testing  procedure,  we  involved  either  physicians  or  auxiliary  medical  personnel  from 
different medical specialties as test subjects, as well as people affected by neurological disorders. All 
tests were performed under the surveillance of a therapist which was part of the development team. 
All users appreciated the system and liked the graphics, scenes and ambience. When asked to choose 
where they wanted to perform the initial tutorial exercises, all users preferred the nature setting as 
opposed to the rehabilitation center one. 

The  gamified  exercises  were  appreciated  as  useful,  interesting  and  entertaining,  and  they 
animated  the  users’  competitive  spirit.  One  of  the  physicians  appreciated  that  the  games  were 
essential  for  rehabilitation,  as  psychological  limitations  are  overcome  by  the  desire  of  self-
improvement  and  movements  remain  restrained  only  by  the  patient’s  physical  limits.  Complex 
movements  are  being  trained  and  the  user  is  pushed  toward  progress  and  easier  rehabilitation. 
Suggestions included some changes to the classical training exercises procedure—the trainer should 
exemplify the movements to the user and they must be executed at the same pace as they are being 
shown, not at each user’s desired pace. This should also be configured by the therapist based on the 
patient’s  condition.  People  affected  by  neurological  disorders  appreciated  that  daily  training 
including all exercises would be tiring and each day should include only a few exercises, changing 
from  one  day  to  another  for  diversity  reasons.  The  test  subjects  would  love  to  see  more  games 
developed for training complex movements. 

Related  to  the  use  of  a  virtual  reality  system,  even  though  most  test  subjects  had  no  prior 
experience with this technology, none of them signaled any side effects. One of the physicians was 
expecting  to  feel dizzy and  have an unpleasant experience  prior  to  the use  of the  system  but  was 
pleasantly surprised as they were getting more and more used to the system from one trial to another. 
Future tests should be conducted with patients suffering from neurological disorders, including tests 
performed with the same subject for several days in a row, to observe progress and the long-term 
effects of the training process. 

Overall,  the  good  accuracy  of  95.59%  shows  great  potential,  yet  changes  can  be  made  for 
ameliorating it. We found no current studies which evaluated rehabilitation exercises performed by 
a user based on the most recent tracking technology used for the HTC Vive Cosmos Elite system, yet 
Jost  et  al.  showed  that  the  HTC  Vive  system  could  offer  a  higher  accuracy  in  both  position  and 
rotation for a robotic arm’s joints [48]. For improving our accuracy, future tests should be performed 
using trackers instead of controllers, for eliminating any differences between the tracking devices’ 
initial and final position and orientation relative to the person’s hand. Trackers are also very light (89 
g each [91]) and do not have to be picked up or held, as they are fixed using straps on the person’s 
fist  joint  or  foot,  respectively.  Furthermore,  the  AnimationRigging  Unity  package  used  for 
developing the inverse kinematics-based animations of our real-time avatar is still in the beta stage 
of development and its performance should be analyzed after its final launch. In addition, goniometer 
angles measured by using mobile applications depend on the mobile phone’s gyroscope precision. 
Studies show that their error can be up to 2.05° without performing a full calibration [92], so a physical 
goniometer should be used in future tests.

One of the biggest improvements which can also have a great impact on the accuracy is related 
to the personalization of the 3D avatar according to the user’s parameters. Currently, custom changes 
can be made to fit the trackers on the user’s hands/feet based on position and rotation offsets, but the 
3D  model’s  body  parts  cannot  be  scaled  according  to  the  user’s  height  and  limbs.  This  aspect  is 
essential,  as  inverse  kinematics  animations  act  differently  if  body  segments  (i.e.,  longer  arms, 
forearms) have different lengths. For adapting the use of case scenarios to each custom user, reference 
poses  should  be  recorded  for  each  patient  (e.g.,  user  relaxed,  with  arms  to  the  side),  not  use  the 
doctor’s  standard  recorded  poses  as  comparison  basis.  Improved  3D  avatars  can  also  reduce  the 
limitation of movements, which is sometimes influenced by the model’s mesh (e.g., forearm flexion 
cannot exceed a certain threshold if the mesh is not deformable to imitate the human skin and will 
produce unnatural effects). 

6. Conclusions 

In this paper, we presented INREX-VR, a virtual reality system using immersive exercises for 
neurorehabilitation.  People  suffering  from  neurological  disorders  see  their  lives  changing 
dramatically—from  day-to-day  activities  to  occupation  and  social  relationships,  the  impact  of  the 
disease over their quality of life is considerable. We took the evolution of sensors-based hardware 
devices  as  a  good  opportunity  for  capturing  training  exercises’  movements  and  performing 
rehabilitation  games  for  improving  people’s  QoL  through  self-training.  With  the  help  of  a  great 
variety of motion detection and biological sensors (HTC Vive system, Myo gesture control armband 
including EMG),  the system  was  suitable for both patients’ rehabilitation process and for  medical 
personnel  training.  The  main  goal  was  to  create  a  flexible,  extensible  system,  containing  gamified 
training exercises for a wide range of neurological conditions, which can improve the quality of life 
of  the  affected  persons.  All  data  provided  by  the  sensors  and  results  of  the  training  exercises  are 
centralized in order to be evaluated or configured by specialists using a mobile application. Besides 
the imitation of classical exercises performed by virtual therapists, the system also includes gamified 
settings, since repeating classical exercises can often decrease motivation as they lack entertainment 
and  competition.  Games  include  an  adaptive  learning  algorithm  which  can  increase  the  difficulty 
levels in real time based on the user’s performance. After discussions with rehabilitation specialists, 
we  confirmed  that  the  system  showed  potential  of  use  for  the  training  of  the  medical  personnel 
involved in the rehabilitation field. 

As presented by Corbetta et al., virtual reality systems can often prove to have better results for 
neurorehabilitation than standard therapy for walking speed, balance and mobility [93]. Our results 
are encouraging, yet future tests should also include neurorehabilitation patients for validating the 
system with impaired persons. Validity threats include the improper configuration and misuse of the 
system  (e.g.,  base  stations  not  placed  at  a  recommended  height  and  angle,  controllers  moved 
independently for “deceiving” the evaluation process). Misconfiguring the HTC Vive system and not 
updating  the  SteamVR  software  regularly  can  lead  to  tracking  issues  or  lost  tracking  (e.g.,  one 
controller disappears in the middle of the training process). These issues can be resolved by providing 
proper  instructions  about  the  system’s  use  and  ensuring  technical  assistance  for  configuration  or 
solving tracking issues. 

In the future, we intend to improve the accuracy of movement evaluation, and plan to develop 
the adaptive learning algorithm so that it is also applied on the classical training exercises, test the 
tele-medicine module with patients and include quizzes for assessing the knowledge of the medical 
personnel  which  use  the  application  for  their  own  training.  As  the  Myo  armband  is  not  available 
anymore on the  market, alternatives are needed for reproducing the project or distributing it on a 
larger scale. One of the alternatives is MyoWare Muscle Sensor, provided by Sparkfun. It is an EMG 
sensor powered by an Arduino board, which also allows the attachment of biomedical pads [94]. The 
use of eight such sensors will reproduce the output provided by the Myo armband in terms of EMG 
data, while the Arduino can be easily integrated into Unity with the use of a plugin [95]. Therefore, 
all data from the EMG can be used as input for the rehabilitation games, using peak-to-peak values 
from the sensors instead of the predefined gestures provided by Myo. This technology has been used

in research projects for assessing the physiological state of a person, in connection with Unity3D and 
the  virtual  reality  HTC  Vive  headset  [96].  Further  research  is  also  needed  to  address  people  with 
stereo blindness (who are not capable of synchronizing the two optical streams), for whom we take 
into consideration disabling 3D stereoscopic vision and rendering the scene only on the left/right eye. 
Furthermore, we plan to investigate the possibility of developing a light version of the system which 
could  be  used  with  low-cost  mobile-based  VR  headsets  for  upper  limb  rehabilitation  and  include 
neural networks for improving the movements’ automatic evaluation. We consider that INREX-VR 
opens  new  opportunities

neurorehabilitation, not as a replacement of a real-life therapist, but as a complementary tool.
