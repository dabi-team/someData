1  Introduction 

With the developments in web, mobile and virtual reality technologies as well as 
mass  adoption  of  smart  and  mobile  devices  by  all  people  in  the  current  society, 
significant opportunities have emerged for e-learning applications [16]. Location- 
based mobile phone software has been proved to  have the potential in support- 
ing  biology,  geography  and  math  lessons  for  students  in  schools  [12].  The  latest 
technologies  from  video  game  industry  make  it  becomes  easy  and  eﬃcient  to 
integrate the state-of-the-art graphics/interface and the educational aspect with 
poor  graphics  and  interaction  [1]  [25].  The  technologies  of  video  games  have 
attracted  considerable  attention  to  enhance  user  participation  and  motivation 
which should be a key concern in the design of an interactive human-computer- 
interaction(HCI)  interface  [5]  of  the  learning  enhanced  system  [10].  Technology 
enhanced learning brings multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and pandisciplinary 
educational  content in  diﬀerent  forms  [2]  oriented  to  diﬀerent culture  [40].  The 
dynamic  learning  environments  can  deliver  educational  benefits  as  educational 
oﬀerings  based  upon  various characteristics  of  individual  learners  [27].  Synthe- 
sizing  multimedia  operations  and  knowledge  sharing  aspects  has  also  attracted 
attention  from  the  research  community  [15].  The  combinations  of  technology 
enhanced learning and  other applied  information field  have been considered as 
promising practical research topics [36]. It has been argued that integration of

concepts from GIS into Information Technology (IT) can provide impressive op- 
portunities for education [38]. The guidelines for the design of 3D virtual learning 
spaces has been suggested before [26]. The related evaluation process has been 
proposed in previous research [16] [6]. Besides, a lot of other previous related re- 
searches have also inspired our research [28] [35] [39] [41] [30] [13] [9] [31] [29] [52]. 
In  virtual  reality  technology  trend,  geospatial  data  visualization  has  never 
been  developing  rapidly  [34].  With  the  development  of  VR  (Virtual  Reality) 
technology  and  widely  applications  in  various  areas,  the  requirements  to  VR 
are  also  increasing  rapidly.  Virtual  Reality  Geographical  Information  System 
(VRGIS),  a  combination  of  geographic  information  system  and  virtual  reality 
technology [14] has become a hot topic. Accordingly, ’3-D modes’ has been proved 
as  a  faster  decision  making  tool  with  fewer  errors  [33].  Meanwhile,  new  user 
interfaces for geo-databases is also expected [3]. With the popularity of network, 
the  VRGIS  platform  based  on  the  network  environment  also  becomes  a  trend. 
The  application  of  VRML,  X3D  and  other  online  VR  technologies  have  achieved 
networking of VR systems [37] [23] [21] [20]. 

WebVRGIS is preferred in practical applications, especially by the geography 
and urban  planning  [22]  [19], which is  based  on  WebVR [24].  Urban  simulation 
is  becoming  widely  noticed  nowadays,  and  some  simulation  systems  have been 
developed  in  this  area,  e.g.  ArcView3D  Analyst,  Imagine  Virtual  GIS,  GeoMe- 
dia,  etc.  WebVRGIS  engine  supports  steadily  real  time  navigation  in  virtual 
scenes which are constructed with massive, multi-dimensional data from various 
sources [55] [18] [47] [54] [46] [17] [48] [44] [45] [32] [53] [49] [50] [42] [43] [51]. 
3D  urban  landscape  database  with various  data  sources  can  be produced  to 
implement  spatial  analysis  and  3D  visualization  and  published  in  the  Internet 
environment  [11]  [7]  [8].  In  this  research,  we  plan  to  use  virtual  reality  geo- 
graphic  information  system  technology  as  an  education  tool  to  teach  the  geog- 
raphy courses. 

2  System  Overview 

3D geometrical analysis education model includes 8 sub-modules: entity set op- 
eration,  buﬀer  analysis,  overlay  analysis,  space  convex  hull  calculation,  space 
convex  decomposition,  3D  topology  analysis,  3D  Minkowski  sum  calculation, 
and 3D space intersection detection, as shown in figure 1. 

3  Functions 

Entity  set  operation  includes  4  sub-modules:  union,  meet,  diﬀerence,  and  equi- 
librium  diﬀerence.  In  the  space  entity,  union  outputs  a  new  entity  including  all 
input  entities.  Meet  outputs  the  common  part  of  all  input  entities.  Diﬀerence 
outputs  spatial  features  included  in  the  former  input  entity  but  excluded  from 
the  next  space  entity. 

Buﬀer analysis includes point, line, face, and body. Buﬀer analysis is served as 

one of spatial analysis tools used to solve proximity-related problems. It is used

to realize spatial extension of a spatial entity, determine the scope of influence of 
this  entity  in  3D  space,  and  reflect  the  gradual  change  law  of  its  influence  with 
distance variation. For instance, the buﬀer of special sphere with the radius as r 
(buﬀer distance R)  is  a  ball  with  the radius  as  r+R. 

Overlay  analysis  refers  to  an  analytical  method  in  which  two  or  more  geo- 
graphic element photos in the same region are overlapped under a unified spatial 
reference system to generate multiple attributive characters of this region. Over- 
lay  analysis  can  be  used  for  new  classification  of  multiple  attributes  generated 
after  such  overlay,  so  as  to  establish  spatial  correspondence  among  geological 
objects, and  extract  quantitative characteristics of some topics  within  the  scope 
of a certain region. 

Space  convex  hull  calculation:  in  3D  figure  application,  we  often  encounter 
such  an  issue:  determine  a  convex  polyhedron  with  the  minimum  volume  and 
including  several  given  points  in  the  space.  It  is  also  a  form  of  the  minimum 
coverage  problems  to  calculate  the  algorithm  of  convex  hull  including  spatial 
point sets. It is widely applied in the modeling of buildings. 

Space  convex  decomposition:  convex  decomposition  of  a  concave  polygon  is 
one of basic problems about computation geometry. It is applied in many fields. 
It  realizes  the  function  of  decomposing  complicated  space  convex  into  simple 
convex polygon. Most existing algorithms are of overall decomposition algorithm. 
However,  fewer  researches  are  made  on  partial  decomposition  algorithm.  The 
overall  decomposition  algorithm  is  time-consuming.  Therefore,  it  cannot  meet 
application needs of all projects. 

3D topology analysis: space topological  relation is an important part of spa- 
tial analysis. How to eﬀectively generate and judge space topological relation has 
direct impact on the eﬃciency of spatial information system. The establishment 
of 3D topological  relation  makes it easy  to  realize  various space operations  and 
information inquiry. Complicated surface features can be described with various 
bodies  filled  in  the  space,  hook  faces  constituting  those  bodies,  boundary  rings 
constituting those  hook  faces, arcs constituting those rings, and  nodes  on those 
arcs.  Generally  speaking,  body  is  basic  constitution  for  the  target  entity.  Any 
complicated  entities  are  deemed  as  composed  of  bodies  (natural  or  artificial). 
Body,  face,  line  and  point  are  dynamic  concepts.  They  are  interconvertible  un- 
der  diﬀerent  scales  or  diﬀerent  research  emphases.  The  following  6  groups  of 
relations  are  used  to describe  the space  topological  relation of 3D  vector struc- 
ture  in  the  spatial  information  system:  relation  between  complicated  surface 
feature  and  body,  relation  among  body,  complicated  surface  feature,  and  hook 
face,  relation  among  hook  face,  ring,  and  body,  relation  among  ring,  arc  and 
hook  face,  relation  among  arc,  node,  and  ring,  and  relation  between  node  and 
arc. 

3D  space  intersection  detection:  while  simulating  3D  animation  scenes,  nu- 
merous collision phenomena will be encountered. Essentially, these collision phe- 
nomena are points, lines, faces, and bodies. It is only necessary to judge whether 
they  intersect  in  3D  space,  and  work  out  intersecting  points,  intersecting  lines, 
intersecting faces, and intersecting bodies. 

 
 
 
4  Application   Scenarios 

The oriented city region simulation WebVRGIS engine is developed based on 
OpenGL and C++, which integrates VR and GIS seamlessly and supports mas- 
sive data. 

As  shown  in  figure  4,  the  user  is  watching  the  virtual  geographical  scene 
through  the  HMD.  The  HMD  is  the  VR  glasses  shell  by  which users  could  watch 
the anaglyph 3D scene generated  from smartphone screen.  The convergence-to- 
face part  of  the HMD  for light blocking  is  made by soft  holster  filling  of  sponge, 
so  it’s  not  oppressive  at  all.  In  addition,  it  can  modify  the  pupil  distance  (PD) 
and  depth  of  field  (DOF),  so  it  is  suitable  for  the  users  with  diﬀerent  myopia 
degree  and  PD.  The  input  methods  include  head  motion  and  remote  controller. 
The  head  motion  on  VR  glasses  only  supports  the  rotations  around  three  axis 
which are controlled by gyroscope sensor of  the smartphone. The head rotation 
actions  are  synchronous  with  the  rotation  of  the  camera  view  in  the  VR  scene, 
which brings  the  immersive perception  to  the  user  in  real  time.  Meanwhile,  the 
remote  controller  is  used  to  input  the  displacement  of  the  3D  scene  as  well  as 
manipulate the menu of the software configuration. 

5  Conclusion 

WebVRGIS  is  used  to  show  the  geographical  information  intuitively  as  an  en- 
hanced  learning  tool.  Geographical  information  has  several  characteristics,  ie. 
large  scale,  diverse  predictable  and  real-time,  which  falls  in  the  range  of  def- 
inition  of  Big  Data  defined  by  Faye  Briggs  [4].  Virtual  reality  is   a   promising 
and  suitable  technology  to  represent  geographical  bigdata.  In  future,  the  new 
technology  will  enhance  the  learning  process,  for  example,  multiple  users  may 
support the teacher to train a class at the same time.
