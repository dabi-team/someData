Abstract 

Virtual reality (VR) allows users to see and manipulate virtual scenes and items 

through input devices, like head-mounted displays. In this study, the effects of button 

size, spacing, and depth on the usability of virtual buttons in VR environments were 

investigated. Task completion time, number of errors, and subjective preferences were 

collected to test different levels of the button size, spacing, and depth. The experiment 

was conducted in a desktop setting with Oculus Rift and Leap motion. A total of 18 

subjects performed a button selection task. The optimal levels of button size and 

spacing within the experimental conditions are 25 mm and between 5 mm and 9 mm, 

respectively. Button sizes of 15 mm with 1-mm spacing were too small to be used in 

VR environments. A trend of decreasing task completion time and the number of errors 

was observed as button size and spacing increased. However, large size and spacing 

may cause fatigue, due to continuous extension of the arms. For depth effects, the touch 

method took a shorter task completion time. However, the push method recorded a 

smaller number of errors, owing to the visual push-feedback. In this paper, we discuss 

advantages and disadvantages in detail. The results can be applied to many different 

application areas with VR HMD.

1. Introduction 

Virtual reality (VR) allows users to see and manipulate virtual scenes and items via 

input devices (Mazuryk and Gervautz, 1996; Burdea and Coiffet, 2003). An American 

scientist, Ivan Sunderland, first pushed the idea of virtual display technology in 1965. He 

claimed, “A display connected to a digital computer gives us a chance to gain familiarity with 

concepts not realizable in the physical world” (Sutherland, 1965). VR technologies enable 

users to have interactive experiences with its engaging and intuitive nature. It even can 

captivate novices who are not familiar with new technologies (Zhang, 2017). As VR has 

consistently developed, the field of introducing VR technologies is progressively expanding, 

such as computer game (Martel and Muldner, 2017), virtual training (Bertram et al., 2015), 

automotive industry (Lawson et al., 2016), and healthcare (Rose et al., 2018). 

To have an immersive and engaging VR experience, input and output devices are 

required such as keyboard, data glove, and head-mounted display (HMD)). Among the 

options, the HMD is the most commonly used device in VR environments. The HMD, like 

Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard, provide intuitive and immersive experiences within a 

virtual environment. However, the VR HMD presents difficulties for traditional controlling 

devices, like physical keyboards (Kim and Kim, 2004). Therefore, indirect methods of 

manipulation, whereby VR interaction is presented by wielding a tool, are necessary 

alternatives to overcome the difficulties. These tools provide users more immersive 

interactions with VR (Sekuler and Blake, 1985). The Samsung HMD Odyssey, for example, 

is an external controller manufactured for VR environments. On the other hand, direct 

method of manipulation uses the human body to interact with the virtual world. This method 

has advantages over the indirect method (Mine et al., 1997). According to their results, the 

direct methods of manipulation enabled higher performance than the manipulation of virtual 

objects with users’ hands. It provided a more immersive virtual environment to users (Lubos 

et al., 2014). The direct method using human body is known to give a high focus and 

impression (IJsselsteijn et al., 2008), which are aspects that have a great influence on 

usability (Sun et al., 1995). Many studies have followed, studying the direct manipulation of 

virtual objects, owing to the potential applications in many different fields (Hofmann et al., 

2013). 

This study aims to understand hand input, a direct method, with VR HMDs and to 

enhance their use of buttons. To achieve these purposes, an experiment was conducted to 

investigate the effects of button size, spacing, and depth on the usability with hand 

interaction. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 demonstrates the method and 

Section 3 reports the results of the experiment. Then, key implications and limitations are 

discussed in Section 4. 

2. Method 

2.1. Subjects 

A total of 18 subjects (9 males and 9 females) voluntarily participated in the experiment. 

Their ages ranged from 18 to 27 years (mean = 23.56, SD = 2.59). The subjects were all 

right-handed. They had normal or corrected vision and freely moved their right hands. Eight 

had no experience with VR devices, whereas others had an average week’s experience. 

2.2. Experimental design 

The experiment used a three-factor (i.e., button size, button spacing, and button depth) 

within-subjects design. A balanced Latin Square was used to avoid transfer, learning, and 

fatigue effects. 

 
The independent variables in this experiment were button size (i.e., SIZE, 3 levels), 

button spacing (i.e., SPACING, 3 levels), and button depth (i.e., METHOD, 2 levels). Owing 

to the lack of literature related to button selection tasks in VR environments, the level of 

independent variables was determined based on studies related to the use of buttons on 

Kiosk-type front-screen devices (Scott and Conzola, 1997; Colle and Hiszem, 2004). 

Research related to the use of buttons on smart phones and personal digital assistants was 

also considered (Park and Han, 2010; Parhi et al., 2006; Park, 2010). 

The button sizes used in Kiosk-type front-screens were 16 mm, 18 mm, and 20 mm, 

and there were no time differences in input speed. Colle and Hiszem (2004) found that, 

among standard button sizes (i.e., 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, and 25 mm), the 20-mm buttons 

were preferred. Several studies on the use of smart phone buttons suggested that their sizes 

should be between 7 mm and 10 mm (Park and Han, 2010; Parhi et al., 2006; Park, 2010). In 

our experiment, a virtual board containing virtual buttons was located 500 mm away from the 

users’ eyes. The distance from a smart phone to user’s eyes is normally 322 mm to 362 mm 

(Bababekova et al., 2011). Thus, the button sizes in our experimental setting were obtained 

proportionally, resulting in sizes ranging from 10 mm to 15 mm. We conducted a pilot 

experiment prior to the main experiment, finding that there exists low accuracy of hand 

movement in VR. Therefore, we increased the button sizes slightly and set the three size 

levels to 15 mm, 20 mm, and 25 mm. These sizes were appropriate enough for subjects to 

sense the differences in button size. 

The level of spacing was also set based on the button-size studies on Kiosk-type 

front-screens and smart phones. Scott and Conzola (1997) claimed that spacing levels of 0 

mm, 2 mm, and 4 mm were not statistically different. They argued that, as the level of 

spacing increased, there existed a trend of increasing errors. Alternatively, Colle and Hiszem 

(2004) found that the spacing of 1 mm and 3 mm was not statistically different. For smart 

 
phones, when the button sizes were less than 4 mm, the spacing larger than 2 mm was 

recommended (Park, 2010). Therefore, the level of spacing in our experiment was set to 1 

mm, 5 mm, and 9 mm. In our pilot experiment, this spacing condition was appropriate, 

enabling users to sense the differences among the three levels.   

For button depth, there were two levels of touch and push methods. The depth of the 

touch method was 0 mm. The touch button sensed the event just as the virtual hand touched 

the button. In contrast, the push method required users to push and move virtual buttons to a 

certain threshold. The push-type virtual button sensed its event trigger when the given depth 

was reached. In the pilot test, the subjects were unable to recognize that the button had a 

depth requirement of 10 mm. Therefore, the depth of button was reset to 15 mm, so that it 

would be visually and clearly recognizable. 

2.3. Dependent measures 

Two types of dependent measures (i.e., pressing performance and subjective preference) were 

collected from the experiment. The pressing performance measures were time-related 

measures (i.e., task completion time, TIME) and accuracy measures (i.e., number of errors, 

ERROR). TIME was defined as the time required to complete the task of correctly pressing a 

target button. Trials with at least one error were eliminated from the data set as in a touch-key 

design study (Kim et al., 2014), because the error event caused increases of time. ERROR 

was defined as the number of incorrect button-pressing. Subjective preference (i.e., PREF) 

was evaluated by subjects on each experimental condition, scoring between 0 and 100 points. 

2.4. Apparatus 

The experiment was conducted using Oculus Rift, a VR HMD developed by Oculus VR. This 

device has an OLED display, 1,080 × 1,200 resolution per eye, a 90-Hz refresh rate, and 110° 

 
field of view. To detect hand motions, Leap motion was attached to the front of the VR 

device. The prototype used for conducting the selection task was implemented using Unity 

and C# programming languages. Virtual buttons were placed on a virtual board. The distance 

from the board and the users’ eyes was 500 mm. This value was derived based on a Korean 

body size survey conducted in 2015 by Statistics Korea. The arm length of the twenties is 583 

mm on average. This value was adjusted in our pilot test to 500 mm so that subjects could 

reach out their arms with ease. Additionally, the size of the virtual hand was set to 177 mm. 

This value was also based on the Korean body size survey in 2015. The size of a hand is 

measured from the lowest part of hand to the tip of the middle finger.   

 The experimental environment is shown in Fig. 1. An instructor and a subject were 

seated together on the same side of a table. Two sensors were placed on the left and right 

sides to sense the subjects’ HMD, onto which, Leap motion was connected via a desktop 

computer located in front of the instructor. The instructor constantly monitored the entire 

experimental process through the monitor.

2.5. Experimental procedure 

Subjects completed a demographic questionnaire prior to the experimental task. The 

demographic data included the individual’s age, VR experience, and gestural device 

experience. Each subject was given written instructions on experimental objectives and 

procedures. The subjects wore the HMD on their heads and performed practice trials to 

become familiar with the experimental environment and the virtual buttons. The experiment 

consisted of 18 conditions. After finishing each condition, subjects were asked to rate their 

subjective preference on button settings. When the entire experiment was finished, an 

interview session was conducted. We asked subjects to provide their personal opinions on the 

size, spacing, and depth of the buttons, as well as any inconvenient experiences during the 

experiment.   

2.6. Experimental task 

Subjects were presented with nine grey buttons in a 3  3 layout (see Fig. 2). When subjects 

pressed the space button on the keyboard with their left hand, the color of one randomly 

determined button changed to blue. In the main experiment, the subjects were instructed to 

select the blue button as accurately as possible. In this experiment, only visual feedback was 

provided without any acoustic or tactile feedback. The color of the button changes back to its 

original grey color when touched or pushed to the threshold limit by the subject’s index 

finger. Touching or pushing buttons other than the target button was recorded as an error. The 

task continued until the subjects correctly touched or pushed the target button. If the blue 

button was not lit on the board, the subjects could rest. When the subject was ready for the 

next task, he or she would press the space bar to continue. For one experimental condition, 

buttons on the board were required to be touched or pushed twice. A total of 18 selection 

tasks were needed for one experimental condition. Therefore, a single subject performed 324 

selection tasks in a single experiment.

3. Results 

An analysis of variances (ANOVA) was performed. For significant main effects, Bonferroni 

multiple comparison was conducted as post-hoc analysis. For significant interactions, simple 

effects tests were conducted. 

3.1. Task completion time (TIME) 

TIME was significantly affected by SIZE (F(2,34) = 11.787, p < .001) by SPACING 

(F(2,34) = 12.477, p < .001) and by METHOD (F(1,17) = 34.169, p < .001) (Table 1). As 

shown in Fig. 3, TIME appeared to decrease as SIZE increased. The SIZE of 15 mm showed 

the longest TIME (1.306 s), followed by 20 mm (1.162 s), and 25 mm (1.077 s). There was 

no significant difference in TIME for SIZEs of 20 mm and 25 mm. The SPACING of 1 mm 

showed the longest TIME (1.246 s), followed by 9 mm (1.153 s), and 5 mm (1.146 s). There 

was no significant difference in TIME for SPACINGs of 5 mm (1.146 s), and 9 mm (1.153 

 
s). The TIME required for the METHOD of touch and push were 1.063 s and 1.3 s, 

respectively, which were significantly different from one another. SIZE significantly 

interacted with METHOD (F(2,34) = 3.547, p < .05). When SIZE was 15 mm, the TIME 

difference between touch and push was larger than the other SIZEs (See Fig. 4). An analysis 

of simple effects showed that the SIZE effect was significant for both the touch METHOD 

(F(2,34) = 4.68, p < .05), and the push METHOD (F(2,34) = 19.05, p < .001). The METHOD 

effect was significant for the 15-mm SIZE (F(1,17) = 62.92, p < .001), for the 20-mm SIZE 

(F(1,17) = 12.32 p < .001), and for the 25-mm SIZE (F(1,17) = 12.37, p < .01).

3.2. Number of errors (ERROR) 

There was a significant effect of SIZE (F(2,34) = 19.592, p < .001), of SPACING (F(2,34) = 

86.527, p < .001), and of METHOD (F(1,17) = 13.249, p < .001) (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 

5, the number of ERRORs was the highest with 2.45 times when the SIZE was 15 mm. 20-

mm SIZE (1.26 times) and 25 mm SIZE (0.92 times) were the next highest ERROR 

producers. There was no significant difference between SIZEs of 20 mm and 25 mm in the 

 
 
 
 
post-hoc analysis. In SPACING, 1-mm SPACING recorded the highest number of errors 

(2.92 times). The 5-mm SPACING and 9-mm SPACING recorded 1.01 times and 0.7 times, 

respectively. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the two SPACINGs in the 

post-hoc analysis. For METHOD, the number of errors was 1.96 times and 1.12 times in the 

touch and push method, respectively. It showed that 1.96 times is statistically different from 

1.12 times. 

In addition, several interaction effects were discovered (see Fig. 6). SIZE significantly 

interacted with SPACING (F(4, 68) = 4.192, p < 0.01). The analysis of simple effects 

showed that the SIZE effect was significant for 1-mm SPACING (F(2,34) = 9.19, p < .001), 

for the 5-mm SPACING (F(2,34) = 14.11 p < .001), and for the 9-mm SPACING (F(2,34) = 

7.48, p < .01). The SPACING effect was significant for the 15-mm SIZE (F(2,34) = 22.16, p 

< .001), for the 20-mm SIZE (F(2,34) = 32.44 p < .001), and for the 25-mm SIZE (F(2,34) = 

9.27, p < .001). 

There were significant interactions between SIZE and METHOD (F(2, 34) = 4.384, p 

< .05). The analysis of simple effects showed that the SIZE effect was significant for both the 

touch METHOD (F(2,34) = 11.49, p < .001), and the push METHOD (F(2,34) = 9.89, p 

< .001). The METHOD effect was significant for the 15-mm SIZE (F(1,17) = 11.62, p < .01), 

but not for the 20-mm SIZE (F(1,17) = 3.33, p = 0.071), or the 25-mm SIZE (F(1,17) = 1.72, 

p = 0.193). Therefore, there was no evidence suggesting that the touch METHOD differed 

from the push METHOD in the number of ERRORs at 20-mm and 25-mm SIZEs.   

Lastly, SPACING and METHOD interacted (F(2,34) = 12.67, p < .001). The analysis 

of simple effects showed that the SPACING effect was significant for both the touch 

METHOD (F(2,34) = 35.64, p < .001), and the push METHOD (F(2,34) = 21.65, p < .001). 

The METHOD effect was significant for the 1-mm SPACING (F(1,17) = 18.39, p < .001), 

but not for the 5-mm SPACING (F(1,17) = 0.23, p = 0.63), or the 9-mm SPACING (F(1,17) 

= 3.01, p = 0.086). This means that there was no evidence that the touch METHOD differed 

from the push METHOD in the number of ERRORs at 5-mm and 9-mm SPACING.

The subjective preference (i.e., PREF) was affected by SIZE (F(2,34) = 61.79, p < .001), 

SPACING (F(2,34) = 36.28, p < .001) (see Table 3). However, METHOD (F(1,17) = 6.51, p 

= 0.13) was not statistically significant. The PREF was the lowest at 15-mm SIZE, which was 

worth 54.4 points. The 20-mm SIZE and 25-mm SIZE recorded 66.9 points and 71.9 points, 

respectively. There existed a trend that SIZE and PREF together increased. In SPACING, 1 

mm recorded 56.4 points, which was the lowest, followed by 5 mm and 9 mm with 68.2 

points and 68.5 points, respectively. As a result of the post-hoc analysis, SPACINGs of 5 mm 

and 9 mm showed no statistically significant differences. For METHOD, the touch method 

received a higher score (66.1 points), than the push method (62.7 points), but the difference 

was not statistically significant.

4. Discussion 

4.1. Button size (SIZE) 

The results showed that the subjects took more time to perform the selection tasks at 15-mm 

SIZE compared to 20-mm SIZE and 25-mm SIZE. More ERRORs were also recorded at 15-

mm SIZE. From the interview session, the subjects preferred larger SIZEs of buttons. Thus, 

the 15-mm SIZE for the VR HMD with a hand-motion environment was too small for utility. 

We developed linear regression models to understand the trend with each dependent 

measures (see Fig. 8). In all models, there is not enough evidence at the α = 0.05 level to 

conclude that there is lack of fit in the simple linear regression model. The models showed 

that TIME and ERROR tend to decrease as SIZE increases, and PREF tends to increase as 

SIZE increases. Within the experimental conditions, therefore, 25-mm SIZE is the most 

recommended. However, even if SIZE becomes very large, performance such as TIME and 

ERROR will be limited. To create a more accurate model that can explain this, it will be 

necessary to refine the SIZE range over 25 mm to explore the appropriate button SIZE in 

future research.   

Fig. 8. Plots of each dependent measure by SIZE. Trend line was drawn using a linear model. 

4.2. Button spacing (SPACING) 

Generally, it takes longer to perform a selection task in small SPACING conditions, because 

subjects must be more precise in their selection process. Similar results were obtained from 

this experiment. In 1-mm SPACING, the longest selection task time was spent, and the 

highest number of errors were recorded. The subjective preference score was also the lowest. 

Therefore, 1-mm SPACING was not appropriate for utility. Additionally, 9-mm SPACING of 

the touch method with 25-mm SIZE and the push method with 15-mm SIZE and 25-mm 

SIZE took longer to perform the task than 5-mm SPACING. This was because too large 

 
 
 
SPACING increases the selection range of users and leads to subjects reaching out even 

farther, requiring longer task completion time. Subject #3 stated, “When the SPACING 

increased, then I had to reach out farther, because the selection range was too spread out. My 

arm got tired.” The subject preference showed similar results in both 5-mm SPACING and 9-

mm SPACING. However, some of the cases in 9-mm SPACING were lower than those of 5-

mm SPACING. We also developed regression models to understand the trend (see Fig. 9). In 

case of ERROR, we developed quadratic model, because there is sufficient evidence at the α 

= 0.05 level to conclude that there is lack of fit in the simple linear regression model. The 

models showed that TIME and ERROR tend to decrease as SPACING increases, and PREF 

tends to increases as SPACING increases. R2 values of linear models for SPACING are lower 

than the values of models for SIZE, because the value of dependent measures at 5-mm and 9-

mm SPACING were analogous unlike 20-mm and 25-mm SIZE. All of these things taken 

together, 1-mm SPACING is not recommended within the experimental conditions and the 

optimal value of SPACING is between 5 mm and 9 mm. To find out more detailed optimal 

SPACING, the narrower range of SPACING (e.g. 5 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, and 9 mm) 

should be studied in the future. 

 
Fig. 9. Plots of each dependent measure by SPACING. Trend lines of TIME and PREF were 

drawn using the linear model, and trend line of ERROR was drawn using the quadratic 

model. 

4.3. Button depth (METHOD) 

The touch method, (depth = 0 mm), recorded a shorter task completion time compared to the 

push method, (depth = 15 mm). However, there were more errors in the touch method. Most 

subjects revealed that touching a button task finished as soon as the button was touched, 

which led them to quickly perform the tasks. This perhaps led to a shorter task completion 

time and more errors for touch buttons. However, pushing tasks required a little bit more 

concentration. Subject #10 said, “the buttons with the push method required more focus in 

performing the task. I felt I would have to put more force with the pushing method.” Subject 

#11 shared a similar experience, “even while I was pushing the button, I felt I would have to 

push in the same way as the button gets pushed.” In this paper, the difference of workload 

(i.e., touch and push method) was not investigated. However, we could infer from the 

collected opinions that the touch method recorded shorter task completion times because it 

required less workload. The lower number of errors in the push method may have occurred 

because of the visual feedback of the virtual buttons. Subjects could visually check and 

 
 
recognize the target button being pushed. If they began to push a wrong button, then they 

simply corrected their position to the target button before an error event was recorded. In 

subjective preferences, there was no significant difference between the touch and the push 

method. The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods obtained from the interview 

sessions can be summarized as follows. The touch method was faster, more convenient, and 

more familiar. Subjects who had used a tablet PC or an iPad were very familiar with the 

touch method. The disadvantage of the touch button was difficulty in recognizing when the 

index finger would make contact. Subject #9 said, “I was just reaching out my arm, but then a 

button simply got touched. I really did not mean it.” However, the advantage of the push 

method is visual feedback. Pushing a button gave visual feedback to subjects, which allowed 

them to obtain presence and immersive experiences. Subject #8 said, “I feel excited when I 

actually see the buttons going up and down.” Subject #18 also said, “when a button is being 

pushed, I felt I was actually pushing a button.” The disadvantage of the push button was the 

extra concentration and effort to push, which is absent during touching. Another disadvantage 

was the lack of physical feedback. Interestingly, no subjects complained about the lack of 

physical feedback of touch-buttons. However, most subjects stated it would be better if there 

were physical feedback when pushing a button. There was even a case where the lack of 

physical feedback had a large impact in the satisfaction of the push buttons. Subject #10 said, 

“Virtual push buttons looked real to me, but when I found out that it gave no physical 

feedback, I felt very awkward and weird.” In all, when designing a button for a selection task 

using hand interaction, a function bringing visible focus to the button being pointed to was 

recommended. With this function, users would be able to easily recognize which button 

would be touched or pushed before making contact. For systems that concentrate on an 

immersive experience, alarms or vibrating sensors can also be used to provide physical 

feedback. Electrical Muscle Stimulation is an example physical feedback, causing muscle 

contractions by sending small (i.e., mA scale) electrical impulses via electrodes attached to 

the skin (Lopes et al., 2015). 

4.4. Fitts’ law analysis 

In this subsection, we introduce the result of Fitts’ law analysis. Fitts’ law is a well-known 

model in which the movement time (MT) required to perform a pointing task is linearly 

correlated to the index of difficulty (ID) (Fitts, 1954). 

𝑀𝑇 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 × 𝐼𝐷   

ID can also be obtained. 

ID =   log2(

𝐷
𝑊𝑒

+ 1)

D represents the distance between two targets, and We is the effective target width, 

indicating the range of actual input hits around the target. It is defined as the width within 

96 % of the total touch points (Mackenzie, 1992; Zhai et al., 2004; Kong and Ren, 2006). To 

perform the Fitts’ law analysis, we extracted the time taken between task start and correct 

button-pressing. With standard deviation (SD) based on 2D coordination, we calculated the 

effective target width, (We = 4.133 SD). We also calculated the distance, D, using an index 

finger trajectory extracted by experimental software. Distance values were measured in 

millimeter and rounded off to the nearest 10th digit.   

The results of Fitts’ analysis are shown in Fig. 10. Whereas there was some limitation 

in our study, in that the starting point was not controlled perfectly, the coefficient of 

determination (R2) of our data, 0.90 for touch method and 0.93 for push method, was 

relatively high, compared to earlier studies on various devices. R2 of Fitts’ fitting was 0.83 

with a mouse (Card et al., 1978), 0.86 with a trackball (Epps, 1986), and 0.55 with a touchpad 

(Epps, 1986). However, our results were slightly lower than 0.96 with hand (Fitts, 1954) and 

0.98 with the joystick (Jagacinski and Monk, 1985). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
R2 was higher in the push method than in the touch. The movement time in the push 

method increased more than in the touch method as the ID increased, reflecting the fact that 

the push method had a longer task completion time.

4.5. Button location 

Our experimental objective was for subjects to touch or push a virtual button in 3 x 3 layout. 

In this section, we discuss task completion time and the number of errors, depending on the 

location of buttons. As Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 show, there exists an increasing trend in task 

completion time when the buttons were placed at the top-left corner and a decreasing trend in 

task completion time when the buttons were placed at the bottom-right corner. Since this 

experiment was held for right-handed subjects, buttons located at the bottom-right corner, 

which were easily approachable for right-handed subjects, showed the fastest task completion 

times. Alternatively, a longer duration of time was required for buttons located at the top-left 

corner. From the error perspective, the center button (i.e., Button #5) recorded the highest 

 
 
 
 
number of errors: 4.67 times. The reason can be inferred from the fact that this button was 

surrounded by all the other buttons. Subjects had difficulties touching or pushing the center 

button without inadvertently touching or pushing the surrounding buttons. High number of 

errors were recorded as 4.33 and 4.61 times at the top-left corner buttons (i.e., Buttons #1 and 

#4, respectively). This indicates that touching or pushing buttons located at the top-left 

corner, where the buttons were the farthest, was very difficult for right-handed subjects.

significant difference by Bonferroni post-hoc comparison with α = .05.

4.6. Gender 

In this subsection, we explore the gender effect on this experiment. In TIME, females took 

longer time (1.298 s) to complete the tasks than male subjects (1.065 s). However, the 

difference was not statistically significant (F(1,17) = 2.444, p = 0.138). There existed no 

other factors to noticeably affect the TIME factor. In ERROR, male subjects recorded higher 

numbers of errors, (1.932 times) compared to female subjects (1.154 times), where the result 

was significant (F(1,17) = 5.38, p < .05). There existed an interaction effect (see Fig. 13) 

between the SIZE and the gender effect (F(2,34) = 6.19, p < .01). From the simple effect 

analysis, the gender effect was significant at a SIZE of 15 mm (F(1,17) = 19.10, p < .001) and 

20 mm (F(1,17) = 5.82, p < .05). However, the gender effect at 25-mm SIZE showed no 

significant effect. The effect of SIZE showed that there existed significant differences 

between the male group (F(2,34) = 26.23, p < .001), and the female group (F(2,34) = 4.21, p 

< .05). For PREF, male subjects tended to give relatively higher subjective scores (69.3 

points) than females, (59.5 points), where the difference was not significant (F(1,17) = 1.221, 

p = 0.286). The gender effect had an interaction effect with METHOD (F(1,17) = 7.69, p 

< .05) (see Fig. 14). From the simple effect analysis, the gender effect showed a significant 

difference in touch METHOD (F(1,17) = 9.31, p < .01), and push METHOD (F(1,17) = 

10.35, p < .01). The METHOD effect was significantly important to female groups (F(1,17) = 

5.62, p <.05), whereas it was not so for the male group (F(1,17) = 0.22, p = 0.64). Thus, it can 

be inferred that females tend to prefer the touch method over the push method. However, 

males do not care whether the method was push or touch. This clearly describes that there 

exist the differences based on gender. In the debriefing session, there were different types of 

replies between the male and female groups. Five out of nine females negatively replied that 

the push method was difficult, because they had to exert more force. Two positively replied 

that the push button was visually amusing, because they could see that the button was being 

pushed. However, most males, six of nine, positively replied that the presence was high, 

owing to the visual effect, and felt happy about it. Only two replied that they experienced 

difficulties, because they had to focus more on the push METHOD. Additionally, they 

provided opinions that it was difficult to concentrate because there was no tactile feedback 

during touch.

5. Conclusion 

In this study, the effect of button size, spacing, and depth on the usability of VR HMDs with 

hand interaction was investigated. Within the experimental conditions, 25 mm was the best, 

in terms of SIZE. The spacing was optimal at between 5 mm and 9 mm, and the excessively 

large spacing increased the fatigue and caused aesthetic defects, affecting the subjective 

preference negatively. There was no significant difference in subjective preference between 

the two buttons, per the differences of depth. However, the touch method was faster than the 

push method. Yet, the number of errors was higher. It is important for the VR HMD to create 

immersive experiences with various feedback methods, given that the subjects required visual 

feedback for the touch method and requested tactile feedback for the push method. The 

results of this experiment are expected to be useful when designing VR buttons to control via 

hand interaction. Further research should explore various new experimental conditions. In 

this study, owing to the lack of research on button design in the VR environments, we 

substituted the experimental condition of other similar areas. This study is a starting point, 

and various new studies should be performed. Additionally, considering the scalability and 

applicability of VR HMDs, further investigation and experimentation into subject age is 

strongly recommended.
