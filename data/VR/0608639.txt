We present a set of 11 type Ia supernova (SN Ia) lightcurves with dense, pre-maximum
sampling. These supernovae (SNe), in galaxies behind the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), were
discovered by the SuperMACHO survey. The SNe span a redshift range of z = 0.11 – 0.35.
Our lightcurves contain some of the earliest pre-maximum observations of SNe Ia to date. We
also give a functional model that describes the SN Ia lightcurve shape (in our V R-band). Our

function uses the “expanding ﬁreball” model of Goldhaber et al. (1998) to describe the rising
lightcurve immediately after explosion but constrains it to smoothly join the remainder of the
lightcurve. We ﬁt this model to a composite observed V R-band lightcurve of three SNe between
redshifts of 0.135 to 0.165. These SNe have not been K-corrected or adjusted to account for
reddening. In this redshift range, the observed V R-band most closely matches the rest frame V -
band. Using the best ﬁt to our functional description of the lightcurve, we ﬁnd the time between
explosion and observed V R-band maximum to be 17.6±1.3(stat)±0.07(sys) rest-frame days for
a SN Ia with a V R-band ∆m−10 of 0.52mag. For the redshifts sampled, the observed V R-band
time-of-maximum brightness should be the same as the rest-frame V -band maximum to within
1.1 rest-frame days.

Introduction

1.1. Rise-time as a tool to discriminate between SN Ia explosion models

The realization that type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used as standardizable candles (Phillips 1993;
Riess et al. 1995, 1996; Hamuy et al. 1996, 1996b) led to an explosion in SN Ia science. Surveys to test
the Hubble Expansion Law at larger distances found that rather than exhibiting a constant or decelerating
expansion rate, the Universe has an accelerating expansion (Riess et al. 1998, Perlmutter et al. 1999).
The consensus explanation for the accelerating expansion is a negative pressure, or dark energy, permeating
the Universe. Today many teams are working to use SNe Ia as standard candles to better constrain the
properties of dark energy (ESSENCE, Matheson et al. 2005; SCP, Kowalski et al. 2005; SNLS, Astier et al.
2006). While the methods to standardize the SN Ia luminosity vary, the interpretation of all their results
rely to varying degrees on the basic assumption that SNe Ia belong to a single-parameter family.

Methods of standardizing SN Ia luminosity distance using the post-maximum lightcurve shape have
proven successful when veriﬁed against other standard candles such as Cepheids (Suntzeﬀ et al. 1999,
Gibson et al. 2000). These results do not necessarily indicate the existence of a single-parameter family of
progenitors, only that the behavior of SNe Ia post-maximum is similar. Still, the most widely considered
SN Ia progenitors are carbon-oxygen (C-O) white dwarfs in binary systems. Even accepting these systems
as the progenitors, questions remain concerning the mechanism and progression of the explosion. Many
competing theories (see Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000 and references therein) predict roughly the same post-
maximum behavior and vary only in the prediction of the pre-maximum, or rising, lightcurves and spectra.
Understanding the explosion mechanism may help us better understand how the population of SNe Ia, and
their progenitors, evolves over cosmological time. Many explosion models are sensitive to progenitor element
abundances which may vary depending on the environment. Combining existing information about the
diﬀerences between low- and high-z stellar populations and galaxies with a more accurate model of the SN Ia
explosion mechanism will help more tightly constrain the impact of evolution on SN Ia lightcurve shape.
Discriminating between competing explosion models, however, requires lightcurve coverage close to the time
of explosion which has been scarcely available.

The reasons for the lack of early pre-maximum lightcurve coverage are many-fold. Some SNe Ia searches
rely on a search-and-follow method where SNe are discovered and then followed by another, larger telescope.

– 3 –

Discovery often occurs near maximum brightness, and dense pre-maximum temporal coverage is not available.
Other surveys, similar to SuperMACHO, revisit the same ﬁelds every few days, obtaining consistent temporal
coverage over the entire lightcurve. These data sets have better pre-maximum coverage but still do not
generally provide densely-sampled pre-maximum lightcurves.
In order to maximize the number of ﬁelds
observed, most surveys use a long, multi-day gap between observations which is suﬃcient to standardize
the post-maximum behavior but often misses the earliest portion of the rise. For higher-z SNe where the
multi-day gap between observations translates to a shorter gap in the SN’s rest-frame, the earliest portion
of the rise is often too faint to be observed. As described more completely below, the SuperMACHO data
avoid these two pitfalls. This survey provides dense coverage (every other night) and deep imaging with its
custom, broadband V R ﬁlter.

1.2. SuperMACHO and Supernova detection

The SuperMACHO project is a ﬁve-year optical survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) aimed
at detecting microlensing of LMC stars (Stubbs et al. 2002). The goal of this survey is to determine the
location of the lens population responsible for the excess microlensing rate observed toward the LMC by the
MACHO project (see Alcock et al. 2000 and references therein) and, thereby, better constrain the fraction
of MAssive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) in the Galactic halo. The survey is conducted on the CTIO
Blanco 4m telescope using a custom V R broadband ﬁlter. SuperMACHO observes 68 LMC ﬁelds during
dark and gray time in the months of October – December. We completed our ﬁfth season of observations in
the second half of 2005. We process our images with a near-real time data reduction pipeline that employs
a diﬀerence-imaging technique (see Alard & Lupton 1998, Alcock et al. 1999, Alard 2000, and G¨ossl 2002 )
which enables us to detect small changes in ﬂux and to produce lightcurves uncontaminated by light from
nearby, non-varying sources.

We present here a uniform set of densely sampled pre-maximum SNe Ia lightcurves from the Super-
MACHO survey. From these we constrain the time to maximum brightness for SNe Ia. We present data
to provide constraints on SN Ia explosion models to aid in discriminating between competing theories. In
Section 2 we discuss our observations. In Section 3 we present our data. In Section 4 we use our data to
place limits on the time to maximum brightness and present a functional model for the SN Ia lightcurve
shape.

2. Observations

2.1.

Imaging

The lightcurves of the sources we report were obtained on the CTIO Blanco 4m telescope during the
2004 season of the SuperMACHO survey. The images were taken using the MOSAIC II wide-ﬁeld CCD
camera. With a plate scale of 0.27”/pixel, MOSAIC II’s 8 SITe 2Kx4k CCDs cover a 0.32 sq. deg. ﬁeld. On
a given night we image approximately 60 of our 68 ﬁelds so that we obtain relatively dense time-coverage
of the events we detect. All survey images are taken in a single, custom V R passband (see Figure 1 for
transmission curve). This broad ﬁlter enables us to detect ﬂux excursions while they are still too faint for
many narrower ﬁlters to detect at high S/N. We use an Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC) to suppress
the atmospheric dispersion through our broad ﬁlter. A detailed description of the data reduction pipeline
and event selection criteria will be available in Rest et al. (2007, in preparation) and Garg et al. (2007, in

– 4 –

preparation).

The images are processed using a near real-time pipeline. SuperMACHO surveys 50 million sources.
The diﬀerence-imaging technique we use enables us to limit our attention to a subset of those lightcurves
that includes only those that show changes in brightness. We identify candidate events by ﬁrst choosing,
from previous years’ data, the highest quality image for each ﬁeld to create a set of templates. We then
subtract the templates from the co-registered detection images to produce “diﬀerence images” showing only
sources whose brightness has varied since the template epoch. This diﬀerence-imaging technique enables
improved sensitivity to faint ﬂux excursions, particularly in crowded ﬁelds such as those in the LMC. We
consider any diﬀerence ﬂux detections coincident within a 1x1 pixel box in all images of a ﬁeld to be from a
single source and so caused by a unique ﬂux excursion event. We obtain a diﬀerence lightcurve for each ﬂux
excursion event by measuring the diﬀerence ﬂux under a point-source function whose center is forced to be
at the centroid of all the diﬀerence image detections clustered within that box. By performing this “forced
diﬀerence ﬂux photometry” on all images of an event location, we measure changes in diﬀerence ﬂux that
are below a triggering threshold of S/N > 5.

Each night’s data reveal hundreds of optically varying events. The majority of these are due to intrin-
sically variable stars, detector artifacts, cosmic rays, and diﬀraction spikes from nearby bright stars. To
limit the set of lightcurves to unique ﬂux excursions (such as microlensing, AGN activity, and supernovae)
of real sources, a series of cuts are applied to the lightcurves. These include the signiﬁcance of the measured
diﬀerence ﬂux and goodness-of-ﬁt to a ﬂat baseline in years prior to the event. Known variable sources
in the MACHO catalog and sources with more than 3 diﬀerence detections of S/N > 10 in previous years
are removed from the set. Finally, all remaining lightcurves and their associated detection and diﬀerence
images are inspected by eye to remove spurious detections caused by artifacts. This selection process whittles
the set of new candidate transient events discovered each night of the survey to approximately 20. Fits to
models of microlensing and SN Ia lightcurves and visual inspection of template and diﬀerence images (for
the appearance of host galaxies) are used to preliminarily categorize the events as microlensing, supernovae,
AGN’s, or other optical transients. The events are then placed in a queue for spectroscopic conﬁrmation
(see Section 2.2).

The ﬁnal lightcurves we present in this paper were produced using the N(N-1)/2 method (hereafter
“NN2”) of Barris et al. (2005). With this method, instead of using a single template, we diﬀerence all
possible image pairs to produce the ﬁnal lightcurve whose points are weighted combinations of the diﬀerence
ﬂux in all subtractions for a given observation. We use NN2 subtractions to provide cleaner diﬀerence
lightcurves for our SNe which are behind very crowded LMC ﬁelds and often close to other variable sources.

2.2. Spectroscopy

Both Magellan telescopes, Clay and Baade, were used to to obtain spectroscopic follow-up of events
identiﬁed by the CTIO 4m. On the Clay Telescope, the Low Dispersion Survey Spectrograph 2 (LDSS2;
Allington-Smith et al., 1994) was used to obtain longslit spectroscopy on our targets. The LDSS2 CCD
detector has a resolution of 0.378”/pixel. We used the following conﬁguration for the spectra obtained on
this instrument: the medium resolution (300 l/mm) blue grism blazed at 5000˚A, a slit of 0.75”, and no
blocking ﬁlter. The spectra have a nominal dispersion of 5.3˚A/pix over the useful wavelength range of
∼3800–7500˚A. On the Baade Telescope, we used the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph
(IMACS; Bigelow & Dressler, 2003) in longslit mode with the long camera (f/4 focus) and the medium

– 5 –

resolution, 300 l/mm, grating. In this conﬁguration the instrument provides a 0.111”/pix image scale with a
nominal dispersion of 0.743˚A/pix over a useful wavelength span of 3800–7500˚A without order blocking ﬁlters.
The nights were mostly photometric and the Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor provided image qualities of
∼0.6”–1.1” FWHM. To minimize slit losses due to atmospheric dispersion, we used a slit aligned to the
parallactic angle. Observations typically consisted of multiple integrations on a source. The S/N on each
target varied with the integration times, source brightness, transparency, and seeing.

Reduction of the spectra consists of the typical single slit processing using standard IRAF routines
for bias subtraction and ﬂat-ﬁelding. Cosmic ray removal is facilitated using the Laplacian Cosmic Ray
identiﬁcation routine of van Dokkum (2001). We co-add the processed 2D images of each target and extract
1D apertures using isolated regions around the target source for the background subtraction. We determine
the best 1D extraction by iterating through multiple target and sky regions to ensure proper source and sky
isolation within the crowded LMC ﬁelds. We ﬁnd the dispersion solution for each image using He Ne Ar
arc lamp observations that show a typical RMS of <0.5˚A. We use spectrophotometric standards (Feige 110,
Hiltner 600, and LTT3864) observed on the same night as the targets for ﬂux calibratation.

3. Data

3.1. Lightcurves

We present 11 SNe Ia from the 2004 observing season. Table 1 gives their positions and redshifts.
Tables 2–12 give the lightcurves for each object. The NN2 diﬀerence ﬂuxes in the lightcurves are given
normalized to a zero point of 25 (see Rest et al. 2005 for V R-band standardization procedure). Figures 2–
6 show the lightcurves with the time axis transformed to the SN rest-frame and relative to the time of
maximum brightness in the observed V R-band, tmax (see Section 4.2 for tmax determination procedure).
lightcurves shown.
We normalize the observed ﬂuxes to the ﬂux at maximum, V Rmax to obtain the f V R
The SNe are grouped by redshift, and each ﬁgure shows all SNe with similar redshifts (see Section 3.2 for
redshift determination procedure). We group the SNe Ia by redshift to limit the impact of K-corrections
(Hamuy et al. 1993, Kim et al. 1996, Schmidt et al. 1998, and Nugent et al. 2002) on our ﬁndings (see 4.3.1
for further discussion of K-corrections).

V Rmax

3.2. Spectra

Table 13 lists the telescope, instrument, observation date, and total integration time for each spectrum
presented. We determine the SN type and redshift by comparing the spectrum to a library of nearby SN
spectra (Matheson et al. 2006, in preparation). Following the method of Matheson et al. (2005) we classify
an event as a SN Ia if it shows the characteristic CaII H&K, SiII, FeII, and SII features (Filippenko 1997).
We choose a comparison spectrum from the nearby library that was obtained at approximately the same
SN phase as our spectrum. We determine the object’s redshift by redshifting the nearby spectrum until the
peaks and valleys match. This gives z to an accuracy of ∼0.01. Because we do not apply Galactic, LMC, or
host galaxy reddening corrections, the continuum shapes of our spectra sometimes appear ﬂatter and redder
than that of the nearby, reddening-corrected spectrum. Figures 7–17 show the spectrum of each SN with
the redshifted nearby comparison spectrum above. The SN’s redshift determined by this method is given in
Table 1.

– 6 –

Three of the spectra also exhibit strong host galaxy emission and absorption features. We use these
features to obtain more accurate redshifts for these sources and to verify the nearby SN comparison method
of redshift determination used for the remaining SNe. To determine the galactic redshifts we ﬁrst ﬁnd the
line centers of the emission and absorption features by ﬁtting a Gaussian proﬁle to each. We then calculate
the galaxy’s redshift by averaging the redshifts of the identiﬁed lines. Table 14 lists the SNe whose spectra
exhibit strong galaxy features, the lines seen, and the galaxy redshift. For reference, the table also lists the
redshift determined by the nearby comparison method. In all cases, the redshifts found by the two methods
agree within better than 0.01.

4. Discussion

4.1. Functional Model of SN Ia Lightcurve

To model our observed V R-band lightcurves, we choose the following function, φ(t), to describe the

diﬀerence ﬂux normalized to the diﬀerence ﬂux at the time of maximum brightness in the V R-band:

2

φ = 0.0 for t < tr
φ = (t−tr )
tr (tr−n) for tr < t < n
φ = 1 − t
for n < t < 0
ntr
φ = 1 − γt2 for 0 < t < m
m−t
τ − 1) for t > m
φ = 1 − m2γ + 2mγτ (e

2

where t is the SN phase in rest-frame days scaled such that t = 0 is the time of maximum, φ is the ratio of
observed V R-band ﬂux at t to maximum ﬂux, tr is the time of explosion, n and m are arbitrary SN phases
such that n < 0 and m > 0, γ is an arbitrary constant, and τ measures the decay time of the late-time
lightcurve. The early-time portion of our model is motivated by Riess et al. (1999). Riess et al. ﬁt their SN Ia
lightcurves prior to −10 days with the expanding ﬁreball model of Goldhaber et al. (1998) which has the
functional form of a parabola with a minimum at the time of explosion. We model the expanding ﬁreball as
φ = α(t−tr)2. We choose an exponential for the late-time lightcurve shape because we expect the luminosity
to be dominated by radioactive decay. For the exponential we pick the generic form φ = φoe− t−tm
τ + c.
The form of φ between −n < t < 0 and 0 < t < m is taken to be two arbitrary second degree polynomials
constrained to be 1 at t = 0. We use the forms φ = 1 − βt2 and φ = 1 − γt2 respectively. We leave
n and m as free parameters in our ﬁt. By requiring that φ be a smoothly connected function (i.e. that the
value of φ and its ﬁrst derivative are everywhere continous), we eliminate α, β, c, φo, and tm. This results
in the form of φ given above, with tr, τ , n, m, and γ as the 5 remaining free parameters.

In the following sections, we will use this model to estimate the time, tmax, of observed frame maximum
brightness, V Rmax, for each SNe and to place constraints on the interval between the time-of-explosion and
maximum brightness.

4.2. Estimation of tmax

For each SN presented, we determine tmax and V Rmax using the functional SN Ia model presented in

Section 4.1. We do so by adding tmax and V Rmax as free parameters to the model such that

– 7 –

fobs(tobs) = V Rmaxφ( tobs −tmax

z

)

where fobs is the observed ﬂux, tobs is the time of the observation, and z is the SN redshift.

Using the C-MINUIT implementation of the MINUIT1 minimization package, we individually determine
the best ﬁt for each lightcurve to fobs by minimizing χ2. Table 1 gives the tmax and V Rmax values for each
SN along with the parabolic errors returned by the MIGRAD processor in MINUIT. We emphasize that
these ﬁts are performed on the lightcurves as observed with no K-corrections, reddening corrections, or
adjustments to account for SN Ia lightcurve shape. We use these ﬁts to obtain estimates of tmax and V Rmax
for each SN and not to assess whether our model, φ(t), provides a good description of the SN Ia lightcurve.
We will discuss the validity of our model below in Section 4.3. For now we choose this model to estimate
tmax and V Rmax because we assume that the SN Ia lightcurve is a smooth, continuous function with single
maximum and an asymmetric shape. fobs(tobs) provides a generic model for such a curve and should give a
reasonable description of the maximum. To provide an initial assessment of this assumption we note that
for each SN the best ﬁt curve generally has a χ2 value close to 1.

For each SN, we use our estimation of tmax and its measured redshift to determine the rest-frame phase,
relative to tmax, of each observation. In the cases where a galaxy redshift is available (see Table 14), we use
its value for the SN’s redshift. Tables 2–12 give the phase and the signiﬁcance (S/N) of each measurement.
Table 1 lists the phase of the ﬁrst S/N>5 observation for each SN.

We scale the diﬀerence ﬂuxes to V Rmax and correct for time dilation using the redshift determined in
Section 3.2 to obtain the lightcurves shown in Figures 2–6. The SNe are presented grouped by redshift to
minimize the diﬀerences in the K-corrections for the SNe in each group. We expect the observed frame V R-
band lightcurve to vary with redshift as the V R ﬁlter samples diﬀerent portions of the rest-frame spectrum.
Because the spectra of SNe Ia near the time of explosion are not well-studied and because we lack multi-
epoch multi-band data for our lightcurves, we bin our data by redshift rather than apply K-corrections. We
choose a bin size of 0.03 in redshift to maximize the number of SNe per bin while keeping the diﬀerence in
K-corrections between redshifts within a bin small.

4.3. Construction of Composite of SN Ia Lightcurve

V Rmax

Using the normalized f V R

lightcurves presented in Section 4.2, we construct a composite SN Ia
lightcurve that is well-sampled from the time of explosion to +60 days. We include SNe from the redshift
bin z=0.135–0.165 to create the composite. For this redshift bin the center of our broadband ﬁlter corresponds
to approximately 5200˚A in the rest-frame, close to V -band. We would expect the light passing through this
ﬁlter to be continuum-dominated, though some FeII & III, SiII, and SII features are present (Filippenko
1997). We use our composite lightcurve to examine the SN Ia lightcurve. In particular we discuss how well
the functional form presented in Section 4.1 describes the lightcurve shape by performing a multi-parameter
ﬁt to the composite lightcurve. We also discuss the rise time to maximum brightness as parameterized by
tr in our functional model.

Using C-MINUIT to minimize χ2, we perform a multi-parameter ﬁt of φ(t) to the composite lightcurve,
including only data between −30 rest-frame days and +60 rest-frame days so as not to allow the ﬂat baseline
to dominate the χ2 of our best ﬁt. Though we ﬁt all four SNe simultaneously, we also reﬁt for tmax

– 8 –

and V Rmax of each individual SN in the composite. For each SN, the best ﬁt tmax obtained through the
simultaneous ﬁt agrees with the tmax found in the individual ﬁts in Section 4.2 to within one observed-frame
day. An initial ﬁt to all four SNe in the z=0.135–0.165 bin indicates that SM-2004-LMC-1060 is a much
faster decliner than the other SNe in the bin, a result that can be veriﬁed from a qualitative inspection of
Figure 3. Removing this SN from the composite lightcurve, we reﬁt φ(t) and ﬁnd a best ﬁt χ2/d.o.f. of 1.16
for 38 d.o.f.. A summary of the parameters and their 1σ parabolic error uncertainties is given in Table 15.

From this ﬁt we conclude that our functional model provides a reasonable description of the overall
shape of the observed V R-band lightcurve for a SN Ia with z between 0.135 and 0.165. To draw further
conclusions about the SN Ia lightcurve from the best ﬁt parameters, we must discuss them in the context
of the systematic eﬀects that might alter the overall composite lightcurve shape and also of any eﬀects
introduced by using multiple SNe with diﬀerent systematics to create the composite. We discuss the three
largest systematic eﬀects aﬀecting our composite lightcurve: 1) the lack of K-corrections to account for SNe
at diﬀerent redshifts; 2) intrinsic diversity in the SN Ia family; and 3) reddening from the host galaxies, the
LMC, and the Milky Way.

To examine the eﬀects of the systematics, we create a tool to construct empirical models of observed
V R-band lightcurves using a library of nearby SN Ia spectra and lightcurves. The lightcurve library spans
a wide range of ∆m15 values2 (see Phillips, M. M. 1993) and the spectral library provides a typical SN Ia
spectrum for each phase of the SN lightcurve from −10 to +70 rest-frame days (Nugent et al. 2002). We use
these libraries to construct observed V R-band lightcurves with a speciﬁed redshift and ∆m15 ranging from
0.8–1.9mag as follows. By applying the ∆m15 weighting method of Prieto et al. (2006), we ﬁrst construct
BV RI lightcurves for the speciﬁed ∆m15 value. We then “warp” the spectrum to match the expected,
rest-frame B − V color at each phase. Finally we convolve the transmission curve of the V R ﬁlter (see
Figure 1) with the redshifted spectrum and obtain the observed V R-band ﬂux for a given phase. We use
a similar procedure to construct reddened lightcurves. After warping the library spectrum to match the
expected color for the speciﬁed ∆m15 value, we approximate the host galaxy reddening by applying the
Cardelli et al. (1989) Galactic reddening law using Rv = 3.1 to the spectrum (see Riess et al. 1986b for
discussion of host galaxy reddening laws). We then redshift the spectrum and apply the LMC reddening
law of Fitzpatrick (1986) with Rv = 3.3. We also add the Galactic reddening using the Cardelli et al. law
with Rv = 3.1. Finally, as in the unreddened case, we convolve the reddened, redshifted spectrum with the
V R-band transmission ﬁlter to obtain the observed V R-band ﬂux. As with our own data, we normalize
these lightcurves to the ﬂux at the time of maximum to create model f V R

lightcurves.

V Rmax

We use this lightcurve simulation tool in the following sections to help us understand the impact of

systematic eﬀects on our ﬁndings.

4.3.1. K-corrections

The general K-correction formula (Schmidt et al. 1998, and Nugent et al. 2002) is used to “correct” for
the fact that, in a given ﬁlter, observations of SNe with diﬀerent redshifts sample diﬀerent portions of the
SN Ia rest-frame spectrum. The observations are typically normalized to the ﬁlter most closely matching the
portion of the rest-frame spectrum sampled by the ﬁlter in the observed frame. To apply such a correction

2The value of ∆m15 refers to the diﬀerence between the B-band SN brightness in magnitudes at maximum brightness and

at +15 rest-frame days.

– 9 –

to a given observation ideally requires a spectrum taken at the same phase as the observation. Because there
are few high-quality SN Ia spectra prior to −10 rest-frame days, we choose not to K-correct our lightcurves.
Instead, we choose SNe from a narrow range of redshifts to avoid introducing scatter into our composite by
sampling very diﬀerent portions of the SN Ia spectrum.

To estimate the variation between the SNe in our bin, we construct unreddened observed V R-band
lightcurves at the redshifts of the SNe in our composite using the lightcurve simulation tool described above.
We choose a ﬁducial ∆m15 of 1.2mag for these model lightcurves. Between −10 and +80 rest-frame days, the
ﬂux/maximum ﬂux ratio of the three lightcurves diﬀers by less than 3% with the maximum spread between
the three at approximately +15 days. All three lightcurves reach maximum brightness at the same phase
relative to rest-frame B-band maximum. On the rising portion, their f V R
lightcurves diﬀer by less than
0.2%. These tests indicate that the systematic error contributed to an estimate of the time to maximum
brightness using a composite lightcurve of SNe at redshifts between 0.135–0.165 without K-corrections is
negligible.

V Rmax

V Rmax

In addition to minimizing scatter between SNe at diﬀerent redshifts, K-corrections would provide a
means for matching our observed V R-band lightcurves to standard bands in the rest-frame. At z=0.15, the
central redshift of the SNe in our composite lightcurve, the observed V R-band most closely matches the
rest-frame V -band. To compare the lightcurves of the observed V R-band at z=0.15 and V -band at z=0,
lightcurves between −10 and +80 rest-frame days with ∆m15 of 1.2mag. Prior to
we construct f V R
maximum, the two lightcurves diﬀer by ∼2% and reach maximum brightness at approximately the same
phase relative to B-band maximum. Their times of maximum diﬀer by less than the resolution of our model
lightcurves which is ∼0.5 rest-frame days. Using a cubic spline ﬁt to the lightcurves near maximum, we ﬁnd
the diﬀerence in the times of maximum to be 1.1 rest-frame days. Post-maximum, the lightcurves diverge
with the observed V R-band lightcurve declining more rapidly. From this comparison we conclude that for
the rising portion of the lightcurve, the observed V R-band lightcurve–with the time axis shifted to the rest-
frame–is a close approximation of the rest-frame V -band lightcurve. The systematic error in an estimate of
the time to V -band maximum using the observed V R-band lightcurve will be less than ±1.1 rest-frame days.

4.3.2. SN Ia Diversity

Intrinsic diversity in the SN Ia family will also impact our estimate of the time-to-maximum from our
composite lightcurve. To reduce the most gross impact of this eﬀect, we remove the obvious fast riser and
decliner SM-2004-LMC-1060 from our composite lightcurve.

To account for the eﬀect of variation between the remaining SNe, we add a free “stretch” parameter,
s, for each of the SNe in the ﬁt following Goldhaber et al. (2001). Using C-MINUIT we perform a multi-
parameter ﬁt to the composite lightcurve and ﬁx the stretch parameter for one of the SNe in the composite
to 1, no stretch. Eﬀectively, the other SNe in the composite are normalized to the shape of the unstretched
SN. We choose SM-2004-LMC-944 as our ﬁducial SNe, because it has the median width of the 3 SNe in the
composite. We present the results of this ﬁt in Table 15. We characterize the “shape” of our best ﬁt by
the value of ∆m−10, the diﬀerence in magnitudes between the V R-band ﬂux at −10 rest-frames days and
at maximum. For the best ﬁt normalized to the shape of SM-2004-LMC-944, ∆m−10 is 0.52mag and the
time-to-maximum is 19.2±1.3 rest-frame days. Figure 18 shows the best ﬁt with the composite lightcurve.
The phases of the data points have been stretched according to the values of s returned by the best ﬁt. By
scaling the time-to-maximum by the best-ﬁt stretch parameters for each of the other SNe in the composite,

– 10 –

we can determine the time-to-maximum for diﬀerent values of ∆m−10. For SM-2004-LMC-803 which has a
∆m−10 of 0.53mag, the time-to-maximum is 18.96 rest-frame days. For SM-2004-LMC-797 with a ∆m−10
of 0.39mag, the time-to-maximum is 20.93 rest-frame days.

Our ﬁts indicate that, like the declining portion of the lightcurve, the shape of the rising lightcurve of
a SN Ia diﬀers between individual SNe in a way that can be paramaterized by a stretch factor. With our
current data, however, we cannot compare these rising lightcurve shape parameters with those describing
the decline rate. This is because our lightcurves are not reddening corrected and, as discussed below, the
declining portion of our lightcurves is the most sensitive to the impact of reddening. Without reddening
corrections we cannot meaningfully compare the rate of rise with the rate of decline in our lightcurves.
Further, because our V R-band lightcurve diﬀers most signiﬁcantly from the standard, V -band ﬁlter on the
decline, comparing our ﬁndings to previous work in standard passbands is also diﬃcult.

4.3.3. Reddening

Reddening from dust along the line-of-sight to the SNe also alters the shape of our composite lightcurve
and impacts our estimates of the parameters in our functional SN Ia model, including the time-to-maximum.
Because the SN spectrum evolves, the eﬀect of reddening changes with SN phase. The bluer the intrinsic
SN light, the larger the change in the observed color caused by dust along the line-of-sight. The light from
the SNe in our sample is reddened by dust in three diﬀerent locations: the host galaxy, the LMC, and the
Galaxy. The line-of-sight dust introduces two diﬀerent eﬀects into our composite lightcurve: 1) the overall
change in the shape of the composite lightcurve due to reddening and 2) increased scatter in the composite
lightcurve due to diﬀerences in the line-of-sight reddening to the three separate SNe in the composite.

V Rmax

To examine the overall impact of reddening, we use the lightcurve simulation tool described above
lightcurve with ∆m15 = 1.2mag at a redshift of 0.15. We then create
to create an unreddened f V R
reddened lightcurves. For the host galaxy reddening we refer to the distribution of color excesses found by
the ESSENCE survey (Wood-Vasey, private communication). Assuming Rv = 3.1, ESSENCE ﬁnds a mean
value for E(B − V ) of 0.06. To obtain a reasonable estimate of E(B − V ) through the LMC, we double
the mean value of the Galaxy-corrected E(B − V ) for LMC stars found by Harris et al. (1997) and use
E(B − V ) = 0.26±0.055. We also use E(B − V ) = 0.07±0.01 through the Galaxy toward the LMC as
suggested by Harris et al. who use the Oestreicher et al. (1995) SN1987A foreground reddening value. We
ﬁnd the ratio of the reddened model lightcurve ﬂux to the unreddened model lightcurve ﬂux at each phase,
and multiply this ratio by the data point in our composite lightcurve at the corresponding phase. For data
points prior to −10 days, we use the ratio at −10 days. In this way we eﬀectively “redden” our composite
lightcurve. We ﬁnd that in our V R-band at z=0.15, the impact of reddening is signiﬁcantly more severe on
the declining arm of the lightcurve. The maximum change in f V R
due to reddening on the rising arm
is ∼0.2%, while the maximum change on the declining arm is ∼5%. To get a more extreme estimate of
the impact of reddening, we also create a reddened lightcurve with a host galaxy E(B − V ) of 0.25. This
value represents approximately the 90th percentile host galaxy color excess found by the ESSENCE survey.
lightcurve by up to ∼0.5% on
Increasing the host galaxy reddening to this amount can change the f V R
the rising arm and ∼10% on the declining arm. Because the rising arm of the lightcurve is so much less
susceptible to changes caused by reddening, we focus our analysis on the rising portion of our composite
lightcurve and the constraints we can place on the time-to-maximum.

V Rmax

V Rmax

To understand how reddening impacts the value in the best ﬁt of the parameter tr, we reﬁt the reddened

– 11 –

composite to our functional model choosing SM-2004-LMC-944 as the ﬁducial SN for normalizing the stretch.
We ﬁnd that the estimate of the time-to-maximum, −tr, is increased by 1.6 rest-frame days. From this we
conclude that the systematic shift in the time-to-maximum caused by reddening is approximately +1.6 rest-
frame days. To examine whether the overall eﬀect of reddening is always to increase the time-to-maximum,
we choose extreme values for the color excess in the LMC, E(B −V ) = 1.26, and the Galaxy, E(B −V ) = 1.07
and reﬁt the “reddened” composite lightcurve. As expected, the estimate of the time-to-maximum is more
signiﬁcantly altered; the absolute value of tr increases by almost 2 rest-frame days. Notably, however, the
reddening only increases, and never decreases, the estimate of the time-to-maximum. From this we conclude
that the overall potential impact of reddening is to increase our estimate of the time-to-maximum by 1.6 rest-
frame days assuming reasonable values of the color excess due to reddening. We modify the value of our
time-to-maximum to reﬂect the impact of the reddening to obtain a best estimate of 17.6±1.3 rest-frame
days.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine how the uncertainties in the LMC, Galaxy, and host
galaxy reddenings as well as the diﬀerences between host galaxy reddening for each of the SNe impact our
estimate of the overall eﬀect of reddening. For each simulation, we create multiple realizations of a reddened
composite lightcurve in the manner described above. We perform a multi-parameter ﬁt on each realization
and calculate the robust mean value of the time-to-maximum and its standard deviation. To isolate the
eﬀect of the uncertainty in each source of reddening, we hold the color excess values of the other reddening
sources ﬁxed and vary the source of interest. For example, to understand how the uncertainty in the LMC’s
color excess aﬀects our estimate of the impact of reddening, we set the Galaxy’s E(B − V ) to 0.07 and the
host galaxy E(B − V ) for all three SNe to 0.06. For each realization, we draw the LMC’s color excess from
a gaussian distribution with a mean of 0.26 and a σ of 0.55, reﬂecting the values determined by Harris et al.
We perform a similar Monte Carlo holding the LMC and host galaxy reddenings ﬁxed while choosing the
Galactic color excess from a gaussian distribution centered at 0.07 with a σ of 0.01. Finally, we estimate the
combined impact of our uncertainty in the host galaxy reddening values and the diﬀerences between them
for each SNe. Holding the LMC and Galactic reddening ﬁxed in each realization, we choose a diﬀerent host
galaxy color excess for each SN from a distribution of host galaxy E(B − V ) similar to that found by the
ESSENCE survey.

For each of the simulations described above, the 3σ-clipped mean value of the time-to-maximum matched
that obtained by using the “best guess” values of the reddenings. The standard deviations about this mean
provides an estimate of the systematic uncertainty in our reddening-corrected time-to-maximum caused by
uncertainties in the reddening caused by each source. For the LMC, the standard deviation of the time-
to-maximum is 0.014. For the Galaxy the standard deviation is 0.012. For the host galaxy reddenings the
standard deviation is 0.067. Summing these numbers in quadrature, we arrive at an estimate of the total
systematic uncertainty in the time-to-maximum due to reddening, ±0.07 rest-frame days.

4.4. Comparison with Previous Findings

Our investigation of systematic eﬀects impacting our composite lightcurve yields the following conclu-
sions. The lack of K-corrections on our SNe chosen from the narrow redshift range of 0.135–0.165 will have a
negligible eﬀect on the overall shape of our composite lightcurve. Without K-corrections, however, we must
be careful in how we compare our observed V R-band lightcurve with the most closely matched rest-frame
ﬁlter, the V -band. We ﬁnd that the rising portion of our observed V R-band lightcurve is similar to the
rest-frame V -band, and that an estimate of the time-of-maximum from our composite lightcurve will diﬀer

– 12 –

from the V -band time-of-maximum by less than 1.1 rest-frame days. To account for intrinsic variability we
introduce a stretch parameter for each of the SNe in the composite lightcurve and normalize the shape to
SM-2004-LMC-944. We estimate that the overall eﬀect of reddening on the time-to-maximum is to increase
it by 1.6 rest-frame days. The systematic error in our estimate of the eﬀect of reddening is ±0.07 rest-frame
days.

Based on the ﬁts described above, the best ﬁt parameters to our functional model give a time-of-explosion
17.6±1.3(stat)±0.07(sys) rest-frame days before maximum V R-band brightness for a SN Ia with a ∆m−10
of 0.52mag. At a z of 0.15, we expect the observed V R-band to most closely match the rest-frame V -band
lightcurve, and we add an additional systematic uncertainty of ±1.1 rest-frame days to our estimate of the
time-to-maximum in the V -band. Our ﬁndings give a smaller value for the time-to-maximum than that of
Riess et al. (1999) for the ﬁducial V -band who ﬁnd a time-to-maximum of 21.1±0.2 days. The signiﬁcance
of this discrepancy is unclear. Our value for the time-to-maximum is normalized to an SN with V R-band
∆m−10 = 0.52mag. As described above, comparing our values of ∆m−10 with previous work is diﬃcult.
For this paper we note the discrepency but without a study that analyzes both our lightcurves and previous
data in the same way, we cannot comment on its signiﬁcance.

5. Conclusion

We present V R-band lightcurves and optical spectra of 11 SNe Ia behind the LMC discovered by the
SuperMACHO survey3. Our data include some of the earliest pre-maximum detections of SNe Ia. We
provide a functional model for the observed V R-band lightcurve from the time of explosion to +60 days by
ﬁtting a composite lightcurve to three SNe in the redshift bin of z=0.135–0.165. The data are ﬁtted without
K-corrections or reddening corrections; however, the set of SNe have been chosen to minimize the impact
(1998) to describe
of these eﬀects. Our function uses the expanding ﬁreball model of Goldhaber et al.
the lightcurve immediately following the explosion. The best ﬁt of our functional model to our composite,
observed V R-band lightcurve gives a time-to-maximum of 17.6±1.3(stat)±0.07(sys) rest-frame days for a
SN Ia with a ∆m−10 of 0.52mag. Our simulations indicate that the V R-band time-of-maximum at z=0.15
should match the rest-frame V -band time-of-maximum to within 1.1 rest-frame days.

We present these data to be used to test competing models of the SN Ia explosion mechanism by placing
observational limits on the time to maximum and the shape of the rising lightcurve. Analyses of our data
are limited by its being in a single band. While our broadband ﬁlter enables us to detect ﬂux earlier, we
cannot calibrate our lightcurves against the nearby sets of SNe Ia observed in BV RI.4 An ideal study should
include both a broadband ﬁlter and the standard ﬁlter set.
