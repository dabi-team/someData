Abstract Based on high-spectral resolution observations performed with the echelle
spectrograph NES of the 6–meter telescope, we have studied the peculiarities of
the spectrum and the velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere and envelope of the opti-
cal counterpart of the infrared source IRAS 23304+6347. We have concluded about
the absence of signiﬁcant variations in the radial velocity Vr inferred from atmo-
spheric absorptions and about its coincidence with the systemic velocity deduced
from radio data. The envelope expansion velocity Vexp = 15.5 km/s has been deter-
mined from the positions of rotational band lines of the C2 Swan (0; 0) band. A
complex emission–absorption proﬁle of the Swan (0; 1) 5635 ˚A has been recorded.
Analysis of the multicomponent NaI D doublet line proﬁle has revealed interstellar
components V(IS) = −61.6 and −13.2 km/s as well as a circumstellar component
with V(CS) =−41.0 km/s whose position corresponds to the velocity inferred from
C2 features. The presence of the interstellar component with Vr =−61.6 km/s in the
spectrum allows d = 2.5 kpc to be considered as a lower limit for the distance to
the star. A splitting of the proﬁles for strong absorptions of ionized metals (YII,
BaII, LaII, SiII) attributable to the presence of a short-wavelength component orig-
inating in the circumstellar envelope has been detected in the optical spectrum of
IRAS 23304+6347 for the ﬁrst time.

1. Introduction

In this paper, we continue to investigate the optical spectra of galactic infrared (IR)
sources identiﬁed with highly evolved stars at the short-lived post-asymptotic giant branch
(post–AGB) evolutionary stage, at which intermediate-mass (3÷8M⊙) stars rapidly pass
into the planetary-nebula phase. Our comprehensive studies of supergiants with large IR
excesses have led to the determination (or renement) of their evolutionary status. One
of the results of our spectroscopy for a sample of high luminosity stars, PPN candidates,
is the conclusion reached by Klochkova (2012) about the inhomogeneity of this sample.
Apart from PPNe, the sample produced on the basis of IR photometry and low-resolution
spectroscopy includes young pre-main sequence stars, high-luminosity stars of various
types, from low-mass semiregular variables to hypergiants.

The fact that PPNe belong to the post–AGB stage makes them extremely interest-
ing both in investigating the ﬁnal evolutionary stages of intermediate-mass stars and in
studying the chemical evolution of stars and galaxies as a whole. The atmospheres of
stars at such an advanced evolutionary stage have chemical peculiarities attributable to
the successive change of energy-releasing nuclear reactions accompanied by a change in the
structure and chemical composition of the stellar envelope, the mixing of matter, and the
dredge–up of nuclear–reaction products to the surface layers of the atmosphere. A small
homogeneous subgroup of PPNe with evolutionary overabundances of carbon and heavy
metals found in the atmospheres of their central stars has been identiﬁed over the last
two decades during the spectroscopy of a sample of PPN candidates at the worlds largest
telescopes (Klochkova 1995, 2013; Zaˇcs et al. 1995; Reddy 1997, 1999, 2002; Klochkova
et al. 1999, 2000a, 2000b; van Winckel and Reyniers 2000; Kipper and Klochkova 2006).
The circumstellar envelopes of these objects have a complex morphology and are generally
enriched in carbon, which manifests itself in the presence of carbon-containing C2, C3,
CN, CO, etc. molecular bands in their IR, radio, and optical spectra. These PPNe belong
to those few objects whose spectra exhibit the 21 µ envelope emission band (Kwok et al.
1999, Hrivnak et al. 2009). Despite an active search for appropriate chemical agents, there
is no ultimate identiﬁcation of this extremely rarely observed feature at present. However,
its presence in the spectra of PPNe with carbon-enriched envelopes suggests that this
emission may be due to the presence of a complex carbon-based molecule in the envelope
(for details and references, see Hrivnak et al. 2009).

A circumstellar gas–dust envelope manifests itself in peculiarities of the radio, IR, and
optical spectra of post–AGB supergiants. The optical spectra of PPNe diﬀer from those
of classical massive supergiants by the presence of molecular bands superimposed on the
spectrum of an F–G supergiant and by the anomalous behavior of the proﬁles for selected
spectral features. These can be the complex emission–absorption proﬁles of HI, NaI, and
HeI lines, the proﬁles of strong absorptions distorted by emissions or splitting, and metal
emissions. The manifestations of the circumstellar envelope in the optical spectra of PPNe
are considered in more detail in Klochkova (2014).

The previous results of our spectroscopy for PPNe with the 6-m BTA telescope were
published in a series of original papers and are summarized in the reviews by Klochkova
(1997, 2012, 2014). In this paper, we present new results of high-resolution spectroscopy
for the post–AGB star identiﬁed with the IR–source IRAS 23304+6147 (below referred to
as IRAS 23304). The central star of IRAS 23304 is a rather faint (B = 15.m52, V = 13.m15)
supergiant of spectral type G2 Ia lying near the Galaxy plane (b = 0.o58). According to
the high-spatial-resolution Hubble space telescope observations by Sahai et al. (2007), the
circumstellar envelope in this system has a complex structure including a multipole and
an extended halo with arcshaped features.

The ﬁrst study of the optical spectrum for the central star of IRAS 23304 belonging
to the group of stars with atmospheres enriched in carbon and heavy metals and the
calculations of elemental abundances in its atmosphere were performed by Klochkova
et al. (2000a), who determined the main parameters of the star: its eﬀective tempera-
ture Teﬀ = 5900 K, surface gravity, considerably reduced metallicity relative to the Sun
[Fe/H] = −0.61, and the abundances of 25 other chemical elements. Van Winckel and
Reyniers (2000) found similar chemical peculiarities based on a higher-resolution spec-
trum. However, in both publications aimed mainly at studying the fundamental parame-
ters of the star and the chemical composition of its atmosphere, little attention was given

Klochkova et al.: Peculiar spectrum of IRAS 23304+6347

to the peculiarities of its spectrum, the pattern of radial velocities, and their variability
with time.

In this paper, the peculiarities of the optical spectrum for the central star of IRAS 23304
and their variability are considered in more detail. Our observational data are brieﬂy
described in Section 2. The peculiarities of the proﬁles for the Hα, NaI D lines metal
lines detected from high-resolution spectra and molecular bands as well as the data on
the velocity ﬁeld in the supergiants atmosphere and envelope are considered in Section 3.
Main conclusions are presented in Section 4.

2. Observational data

In this paper, we use the spectra taken at the Nasmyth focus with the NES echelle spec-
trograph (Panchuk et al. 2007, 2009) on October 12, 2013. In combination with an image
slicer, the NES spectrograph provides a spectral resolution R ≈60000. A 2048×4096-pixel
CCD array has been used at the NES spectrograph since 2011, which has allowed the
recorded spectral range to be extended considerably. In addition, for comparison, we used
the spectra taken with the PFES echelle spectrograph (Panchuk et al. 1998) at the prime
focus of the BTA telescope with a resolution R≈15000 during several observational sets
in 1997.

The details of our spectrophotometric and positional measurements of the spectra were
described in previously published papers; the corresponding references to them are given in
Klochkova (2014). Note that applying the image slicer required a signiﬁcant modication of
the standard ECHELLE context of the MIDAS software package. The data were extracted
from two-dimensional echelle spectra with the software package described by Yushkin and
Klochkova (2005). The DECH 20 code (Galazutdinov 1992), which allows, in particular,
the radial velocities to be measured from individual features of complex lines typical for
the spectra of the program stars, was used to reduce the extracted spectra.

3. Peculiarities of the optical spectrum

It follows from our spectroscopy for the sample of PPNe that the following main types
of spectral features are observed in their optical spectra: (1) low or moderate-intensity
metal absorptions whose symmetric proﬁles have no apparent distortions; (2) complex
neutral hydrogen line proﬁles changing with time and including absorption and emission
components; (3) the strongest metal absorptions with a low lowerlevel excitation potential,
their variable proﬁles are often distorted by envelope features causing an asymmetry of
the proﬁle or its splitting into components; (4) absorption or emission bands of molecules,
mostly carbon-containing ones; (5) envelope components of the NaI and KI resonance
lines; and (6) narrow permitted or forbidden emission lines of metals originating in the
envelopes. The main diﬀerence between the spectra of PPNe and massive supergiants is
the presence of features of types 2–6.

All the main peculiarities of the optical spectra for PPNe are contained in the spec-
tra of the post–AGB star HD 56126. The latter may be considered by the combina-
tion of observed properties (a typical double-humped spectral energy distribution, an
F–supergiant spectrum with a variable absorption–emission Hα line proﬁle, the presence
of C2 Swan molecular bands in the optical spectrum originating in an outowing extended
envelope, large overabundances of carbon and heavy metals synthesized during the star

evolution through the s–process and dredged–up to the surface layers of the atmosphere
through mixing) as a canonical post–AGB star. As follows from Fig. 2 in the spectral atlas
(Klochkova et al. 2007) based on a long-term monitoring of HD 56126 with BTA, the Hα
proﬁle in its spectrum took all of the varieties listed above: an asymmetric core, a direct
or inverse P Cyg proﬁle, and a proﬁle with two emissions in the wings.

In the subgroup of PPNe with the 21 µ emission feature, the central star of the IR source
IRAS 23304 belongs to the coolest ones (its spectral type is G2 Ia), with the eﬀective
temperature Teﬀ = 5900 K. The temperatures in the central stars of IRAS 22272+5435
(G5 Ia) and IRAS 20000+3239 (G8 Ia) are even lower: Teﬀ = 5650 K (Klochkova et al.
2009) and 5000 K (Klochkova and Kipper 2006), respectively.

The Hα line. The Hα line in the PPN spectra has complex (a combination of emission
and absorption components), time-varying proﬁles of various types: with an asymmetric
core, P Cyg or inverse P Cyg ones, and with two emission components in the wings. The

presence of an emission in the Hα line points to a high mass loss rate and is one of the
criteria for searching and identifying PPNe. The Hα proﬁle in the spectrum of IRAS 23304
is also subjected to signiﬁcant changes: in Fig. 1 from Klochkova et al. (2000a), a strong
emission is superimposed on the short-wavelength wing of the absorption proﬁle typical
of G–supergiants. The proﬁle in the spectrum taken in 2013 and presented in Fig. 1 in
“relative intensity–Vr” coordinates has an absorption core of the same depth as that in
the 1997 spectrum, but it contains no peculiarities.

Molecular features. In their paper devoted to investigating the molecular compo-
nent of the PPN spectra, Bakker et al. (1997) point out the presence of C2 bands for
the source IRAS 23304 whose positions in the spectrum correspond to the circumstellar
envelope velocity Vr(CS) =−39.7 km/s, which leads to the envelope expansion velocity
Vexp = 13.9 km/s. The observations of two envelope CO bands give the envelope expan-
sion velocity Vexp = 9.2 and 10.3 km/s (Hrivnak et al. 2005). We emphasize that Bakker
et al. (1997) pointed out the presence of Swan bands in the form of absorption features.
The (0; 0) 5165 ˚A band was also recorded in our 1997 and 2013 spectra. However, the
intensity in the head of the (0; 1) band in both spectra exceeds appreciably the 5635 ˚A
local continuum level, i.e., we detected a complex absorption–emission proﬁle of the band
(0; 1) 5635 ˚A.

The table gives the radial velocity Vr(C2) =−41.3 ± 0.2 km/s that we measured from
the positions of the 24 rotational lines of the Swan 5165 ˚A band in the 2013 spectrum.
Taking into account the systemic velocity Vsys(CO) =−25.8 km/s from Woodsworth et al.
(1990), we obtain the envelope expansion velocity Vexp = 15.5 km/s. A velocity Vr(C2) ≈
−50 km/s was derived in Klochkova et al. (2000a) from the positions of the band heads
because of the lower spectral resolution. When an asymmetric head with a shade of violet
is convolved with a low-resolution, the position of the head is shifted to a short-wavelength
velocity, which explains the diﬀerence in the results of the measurements in the 1997 and
2013 spectra.

The NaI doublet resonance lines and diﬀuse bands. The heliocentric radial veloc-
ities for the main components of the NaI D lines presented in Fig. 1 are Vr =−61.6, −41.0,
−26.0, and −13.2 km/s (see the table). Here, it should be noted that the velocities for
these components diﬀer from those in our previous publication (Klochkova et al. 2000a).
The moderate resolution (R = 15000) in the spectra used in this paper was insuﬃcient for
the identiﬁcation of individual components in the complex NaI D line proﬁle.

The component of the NaI doublet lines whose position corresponds to the veloc-
ity Vr =−26.0 km/s originates in the stellar atmosphere, because its position agrees

6

Klochkova et al.: Peculiar spectrum of IRAS 23304+6347

with the positions of the overwhelming majority of symmetric stellar absorptions in
the spectrum of the optical counterpart of IRAS 23304. The longer-wavelength compo-
nent, Vr =−13.2 km/s, is interstellar and originates in the Local arm of the Galaxy. The
shortest-wavelength component, Vr =−61.6 km/s, of the NaI doublet is also interstellar; it
originates in the interstellar medium of the Perseus arm. The presence of an analogous in-
terstellar component with Vr≈ −63 km/s in the spectra of the B–stars HD 4841, HD 4694,
and Hiltner 62, whose positions in the Galaxy are close to the longitude of IRAS 23304,
serves as an argument for this. The spectra of these stars, members of the Cas OB7 associ-
ation, were studied by Miroshnichenko et al. (2009). The presence of the component with
Vr =−61.6 km/s allows us to consider the distance to the Cas OB7 association d = 2.5 kpc
from Cazzolato and Pineault (2003) as a lower limit for the distance to IRAS 23304.

Regarding the component of the NaI D lines with Vr =−41.0 km/s, it is natural to
assume that it originates in the expanding circumstellar envelope of IRAS 23304, where
the Swan bands are also formed (the close radial velocity Vr(CS) =−39.7 km/s corresponds
to their positions). Thus, we obtain an envelope expansion velocity Vexp≈13 km/s typical
for PPNe (Loup et al. 1993; Klochkova 2014).

According to the results of Miroshnichenko et al. (2009), there are diﬀuse interstellar
bands (DIBs) with velocities in the range −11 ÷ −14 km/s in the spectra of the hot
stars HD 4841, HD 4694, and Hiltner 62 mentioned above. It is also natural to expect
the presence of DIBs in the spectra of the optical counterpart of IRAS 23304. Luna et
al. (2008) provide their measurements of the positions of DIBs that have a very large
spread of Vr in the spectrum of IRAS 23304, from −26 to +5 km/s. We measured the
positions of ﬁve absorptions that could be identiﬁed with the 5797, 6196, 6203, 6207, and
6613 ˚A DIBs. The mean velocity for them is Vr(DIBs) =−15 km/s. If, however, we discard
the 6613 ˚A band blended in the spectrum of the supergiant by a strong YII line, then
we obtain a mean velocity Vr(DIBs) =−14.0 ± 1.3 km/s close to Vr =−13.2 km/s inferred
from the longestwavelength component of the NaI D lines. We see, that for a more deﬁnite
conclusion about the positions of DIBs in the spectrum of a cool supergiant, it is necessary
to have observational data with an ultrahigh spectral resolution, R≥100000.

Asymmetry of the proﬁles for strong absorptions of ionized metals. Thanks to
their high spectral resolution (R = 60000), the 2013 observations allowed us to detect one
more, previously unknown peculiarity of the optical spectrum for IRAS 23304, complex
(asymmetric or split) proﬁles of the strongest metal absorptions. This peculiarity is clearly
seen in Fig. 2, where the YII 5200 ˚A, LaII 6390 ˚A, and BaII 6141, 6496 ˚A, SiII 6347 ˚A line
proﬁles are presented. The BaII absorptions in the spectrum of IRAS 23304 are enhanced
to such an extent that their equivalent widths Wλ are comparable to those for the neutral
hydrogen lines: Wλ(6141) = 0.76 ˚A, Wλ(Hα) = 0.84 ˚A.

Let us consider the detected eﬀect in slightly more detail using the selected lines pre-
sented in Fig. 2 in “relative intensity – Vr” coordinates as an example. As can be seen
from Fig. 2 and the data in the table, the proﬁles of these lines include a component
whose position coincides with the positions of symmetric absorptions in the spectrum and
a short–wavelength component whose position corresponds to the velocity inferred from
the C2 Swan band. The proposed interpretation of the complex proﬁle is conﬁrmed by
our comparison of the line proﬁles in Figs. 1 and 2. The position of the short–wavelength
component also coincides with the position of the circumstellar component in the Na D1
proﬁle. Thus, it can be asserted that, apart from the photospheric component, the complex
BaII line proﬁle contains a component originating in the circumstellar envelope, suggest-

ing an eﬀecient dredge–up of the heavy metals produced during the preceding evolution
of this star into the envelope.

The separation between the atmospheric and circumstellar line components is about
15 km/s. All the lines of heavy-metal ions (BaII, YII, LaII) in which a proﬁle asymmetry
was detected are distinguished by a low lower-level excitation potential, χlow < 1 eV. As
the spectral resolution is reduced, the intensity of the envelope components will be added
to the intensity of the components originating in the atmosphere, which will lead to an
overestimation of the heavy element abundances determined from strong absorptions. The
abundances determined from low- and moderate-intensity lines will be more realistic.

A complex proﬁle for the absorptions of heavy metal ions that, apart from the pho-
tospheric component, also contains the circumstellar one was found previously in the
spectra of the related post–AGB stars V354 Lac = IRAS 22272+5435 (Klochkova 2009),
V448 Lac = IRAS 22223+4327 (Klochkova et al. 2010), and V5112 Sgr = IRAS 19500−1709
(Klochkova 2013). The envelope eﬀect in the spectrum of the high–latitude supergiant

8

Klochkova et al.: Peculiar spectrum of IRAS 23304+6347

V5112 Sgr, which enters the group of PPNe with an atmosphere enriched in carbon and
heavy metals and its IR spectrum contains the 21 µ emission feature, is of greatest inter-
est. An asymmetry and splitting of strong absorptions with a low lower-level excitation
potential were detected in the spectra of V5112 Sgr taken with the NES echelle spec-
trograph at the 6–meter telescope (Klochkova 2013). The eﬀect is maximal for the BaII
lines whose proﬁle is split into three components. The shape of the proﬁles for the split
lines and their positions change with time. Our analysis of the velocity ﬁeld led us to
conclude that both short-wavelength components of the split absorptions originate in the
structured circumstellar envelope of V5112 Sgr.

We emphasize that the strong SiII 6347 and 6371 ˚A lines in the spectrum of the optical
counterpart of IRAS 23304 are also asymmetric (Fig. 2). Apart from the photospheric
component, both these lines include a weak short-wavelength component whose position
points to its formation in the stellar gaseous envelope. This peculiarity of the SiII lines is
consistent with a signiﬁcant silicon overabundance in the stellar atmosphere (Klochkova
et al. 2000a; van Winckel and Reyniers 2000). Thus, for the ﬁrst time we have detected the
dredge–up of not only s–process elements but also silicon into the envelope. The synthesis
of silicon is possible through the capture of protons by heavier nuclei in the hot layers
of the convective envelope in massive AGB stars with initial masses higher than 4 M⊙.
A description of this so-called “hot bottom burning” (HBB) and the necessary references
are available in Ventura et al. (2011) devoted to the synthesis of Mg, Al, and Si through
HBB.

4. The velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere and envelope

The heliocentric radial velocity of IRAS 23304 that we measured from a large set of visually
symmetric absorptions is Vr(abs) =−25.7 ± 0.2 km/s. First, this velocity coincides with
the systemic velocity Vsys(CO) =−25.8 km/s inferred from the radio CO observations
performed by Woodsworth et al. (1990) for a sample of PPNe with the 21 µ band. Second,
the velocity we found agrees well with the velocity estimated from absorptions for two
times of observations of IRAS 23304 in 1994 (Vr =−26, −26 km/s from the data of van
Winckel and Reyniers (2000)) and three times of its observations in 1997 (Vr =−23.4,
−24.9, −25.3 km/s from the measurements by Klochkova et al. (2000a)).

This constancy of the velocity leads us to the preliminary conclusion about the ab-
sence of pulsations and signatures of binarity in the system. However, it should be noted
that Hrivnak et al. (2010) revealed a weak brightness variability of the object with an
amplitude of about 0.m2 and a period P ≈85 days as a result of their long–term photo-
metric monitoring of IRAS 23304. The parameters of the brightness and color variability
in IRAS 23304 derived by Hrivnak et al. (2010) are typical for PPNe with a temperature
close to that of IRAS 23304. As regards the Vr variability, the weak velocity variability
from the available, so far scarce data distinguishes this object among the remaining PPNe
with enriched atmospheres. Having studied the variability for seven such PPNe, Hrivnak
et al. (2011) found a pulsational Vr variability with amplitudes of ≈10 km/s.

It is pertinent to dwell on the methodological aspects of studying the velocity ﬁeld
in the atmospheres of PPNe. The overwhelming majority of the radial velocities used by
Hrivnak et al. (2013) were obtained with CORAVEL–type spectrometers. For deﬁniteness,
consider the results obtained by these authors for V354 Lac (IRAS 22272+5435). The
measurements were performed predominantly by various cross–correlation techniques. A

Klochkova et al.: Peculiar spectrum of IRAS 23304+6347

fundamental shortcoming of the single-channel methods is a mismatch between the scales
of the spectrum and the shifted spectral mask arising at any change in the stellar radial
velocity. In the period 1991–1995, Hrivnak et al. (2013) used the DAO cross–correlation
photometer (Fletcher et al. 1982; McClure et al. 1985). The above mismatch between the
scales was partly compensated for by a special design of the mask (a with a system of tall
slits in the range 4000–4600 ˚A, slope changing with distance from the mask center) and a
special law of mask motion (at 45o to the spectrum axis).

In their description of the DAO correlation photometer, Fletcher et al. (1982) point out
a systematic zero-point drift for the radial velocities (1 km/s in 2 h), which they managed
to reduce by half, to 0.5 km/s, by frequent zero-point calibration based on a comparison
spectrum. Since the correlation focus of the DAO 1.2–m photometer at the coude telescope
is not subjected to any mechanical deformations, the above zero-point drift for the radial
velocities is completely determined by the ﬁlling of the spectrograph aperture, variable
with the object‘s horizontal coordinates.

The Vr measurements in the period 2007–2011 performed from the spectra taken with a
CCD array in the range 4350–4500 ˚A are free from the mismatch of the scales, because the
mask is no longer mechanical but digital; besides, the wavelength range is shorter by four
times. The longer the spectrum interval intercepted by the mask, the more pronounced the
mismatch between the mask and spectrum scales. This problem was solved by T. Walraven
and J. Walraven (1972) by using short spectral orders, i.e., by applying echelle correlation
photometers.

The third series of radial-velocity measurements for IRAS 22272+5435 was performed
with an echelle correlation photometer whose design, in fact, copies the photometer of
Tokovinin (1987). Upgren et al. (2002) provided the errors calculated from the “cross-
correlation dip area-radial velocity error” relationship taken from Jasniewicz and Mayor
(1988) for this photometer based on 153 individual measurements performed for 149 stars.
Excluding the errors of more than 1.1 km/s, we obtained a mean error of 0.83 km/s for
142 stars from Table 1 in Upgren et al. (2002). For Tokovinins correlation photometer,
the error due to construction ﬂexure reaches 0.6 km/s, but it can be reduced to 0.1 km/s
by orienting the slit parallel to the vertical circle (Tokovinin 1987). However, the errors
due to atmospheric dispersion shifting the centers of the star monochromatic images
across the slit increase in this case. The angular width of the correlation photometer
slit is ≈1 arcsec; the centers of the monochromatic images for the extreme wavelengths
of the simultaneously recorded range (4000–6000 ˚A) will be separated virtually by the
same amount at a zenith distance of 45o. The estimate was obtained from the tables
of diﬀerential refraction calculated by Filippenko (1982) for the altitude h = 2 km. The
diﬀerential refraction eﬀect for the Moletai Observatory (h = 0.2 km) is more pronounced.
Let us estimate the radial-velocity error due to inaccurate centering of the star on
the slit. For an autocollimation photometer, the scales on the entrance slit and on the
mask are identical. For λ = 4400 ˚A, a shift of the spectrum by 0.0074 mm corresponds
to a Doppler shift by 1 km/s (Tokovinin 1987). This means that a radial-velocity mea-
surement error of 1 km/s can be obtained at an error in centering the star on the slit of
0.01 arcsec. An optical element “tangling” the rays along the slit width was used as the
slit in Tokovinins photometer. The slit width in the photometer used by Hrivnak et al.
(2013) is 0.11 mm (Upgren et al. 2002). The standard star and the program star cannot be
unambiguously set on the slit with an accuracy better than 0.1 arcsec even in the presence
of an autoguider. On the whole, it can be asserted that the instrumental eﬀects of the

10

Klochkova et al.: Peculiar spectrum of IRAS 23304+6347

single-channel correlation techniques limit the accuracy of Vr measurements at 0.8 km/s.
This value should be kept in mind when interpreting the peculiarities of the radial veloc-
ity curve for IRAS 22272+5435 provided by Zaˇcs et al. (2009). Recall that periodic radial
velocity oscillations with a semi-amplitude of 3.1 km/s were detected in this paper, with
the overall scatter of individual measurements from the mean heliocentric velocity reach-
ing ±5 km/s. Note that we obtain an accuracy of ≈0.8 km/s typical for cross-correlation
techniques from the spectra when measuring the position of a single line (Klochkova et
al. 2010). In the spectra of F–supergiants, the accuracy of Vr from an ensemble of several
hundred symmetric absorptions is an order of magnitude better.

In addition, in the case of a correlation technique of Vr measurements, the possible
peculiarities of the proﬁles for strong lines attributable to a complex pattern of the velocity
ﬁeld in the atmospheres of these stars and the inﬂuence of the circumstellar envelope on
the proﬁles are disregarded. Based on the spectra taken with BTA in a wide wavelength
range, we found an asymmetry and splitting of the proﬁles for low excitation lines in the
spectra of the post–AGB stars V5112 Sgr (Klochkova 2013), V354 Lac (Klochkova 2009),
and V448 Lac (Klochkova et al. 2010). This is primarily observed in the BaII, YII, and
LaII resonance absorption lines. A temporal variability of the proﬁles for the above lines
was revealed. The set of peculiarities of these proﬁles can be explained by a superposition
of spectral features: absorptions originating in the stellar atmosphere and an envelope
emission. The anomalies of the proﬁles and their variability can aﬀect signiﬁcantly the
conclusions about the pulsation properties. For instance, for V448 Lac, Klochkova et al.
(2010) detected diﬀerential line shifts reaching 8 km/s and a very low pulsation amplitude
∆Vr≈1–2 km/s, while Hrivnak et al. (2013) found an amplitude exceeding this value
manyfold.

The large spread of Vr for close times of observations of V354 Lac and V448 Lac (Hrivnak
et al. 2013) at a more regular brightness variation in the star can probably be explained
by the neglect of both instrumental and these subtle kinematic eﬀects. The amplitude
of the diﬀerential shifts in the atmosphere of the post–AGB star HD 56126 is even more
signiﬁcant (Klochkova and Chentsov 2007): they reach 15 km/s for metal lines. Thus,
apart from the pulsational variability with time, the pattern of Vr variations in the case
of PPNe can also be complicated by diﬀerential motions in the extended atmospheres
of the program objects. A detailed analysis of Vr based on high spectral- and time-
resolution spectra for the selected, brightest PPNe allows the diﬀerences in the behavior
of Vr determined from lines with diﬀerent degrees of excitation originating at diﬀerent
depths in the stellar atmosphere to be detected.

5. Conclusions

Based on high-spectral-resolution observations performed with the echelle spectrograph
of the 6-m telescope, we studied the peculiarities of the spectrum and the details of the
velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere and envelope of a faint supergiant, the central star of
the IR–source IRAS 23304+6347. Our comparison of the radial velocity Vr =−25.7 km/s
inferred from numerous low- and moderate-intensity symmetric absorptions with previ-
ously published results points to the absence of signiﬁcant variations in the velocity and
its coincidence with the systemic velocity deduced from radio data.

Based on our measurements of the positions for 24 rotational lines of the C2 Swan (0; 0)
λ 5165 ˚A band, we determined the envelope expansion velocity Vexp = 15.5 km/s, typical

for post-AGB stars. A complex emission–absorption proﬁle was detected for the Swan
(0; 1) 5635 ˚A band.

Our analysis of the multicomponent NaI D doublet line proﬁle revealed interstellar com-
ponents with velocities V(IS) =−61.6 and −13.2 km/s as well a circumstellar component
with V(CS) =−41.0 km/s whose position corresponds to the velocity inferred from C2
features. The shortestwavelength component (Vr =−61.6 km/s ) of the NaI D lines origi-
nates in the interstellar medium of the Perseus arm. Its presence allows d = 2.5 kpc to be
considered as a low limit for the distance to IRAS 23304.

Based on four features identiﬁed with diﬀuse interstellar bands (DIBs), we found the
mean velocity Vr(DIBs) =−14.0±1.3 km/s close to Vr =−13.2 km/s inferred from the long-
wavelength interstellar component of the NaI D lines. An asymmetry of the proﬁles for
strong absorptions of ionized metals (YII, BaII, LaII, SiII) attributable to the presence of
a short-wavelength component originating in the circumstellar envelope in these lines has
been detected in the optical spectrum of IRAS 23304 for the ﬁrst time. The overabundance
of silicon whose synthesis is possible through the hot bottom burning process in the
hot layers of the convective envelope in massive AGB stars suggests that the star being
investigated belongs to stars with initial masses higher than 4M⊙.
