Abstract. In this article we report a case study of a Language and
Culture-oriented transdisciplinary XR hackathon organized with Goethe-
Institut. The hackathon was hosted as an online event in November 2020
by our University Lab in collaboration with Goethe-Institut as a follow-
up to our previous co-organized event within our research group Living
Lab. We have improved the formula of the event based on lessons learned
from its previous edition. First, in one of the two hackathon tracks we
provided the participants with a custom VR framework, to serve as a
starting point for their designs to skip the repetitive early development
stage. In cooperation with our partner, Goethe-Institut, we have also
outlined best modern research-backed language-learning practices and
methods and gathered them into actionable evaluation criteria.

Introduction and Related Works

Hackathons have great potential for sparking inspiring ideas and collaborations
and they provide great informal learning opportunities for students [6,9,3] and
other participants, for example older adults, who may join hackathons as ex-
perts [4] - however, this massive potential is rarely realized in full. According
to a survey of 150 hackathon participants [1], they do not participate because
they want to build a product (26%), rather they do it for learning (86%) and
networking (82%), especially if it is a corporate event, where the primary motiva-
tion, both of the organizers and attendees is ﬁnding employment [11]. Therefore,
hackathons ought to be constructed in a more user-centric, or participant-centric
manner, with these predominant motivations in mind, especially in learning en-
vironments. For this reason, in this event organized a year we tried an approach
diﬀerent from our previous practice.

The online event we organized was a follow-up to an event co-organized with
Goethe-Institut a year prior, which we described in a case study at CHI 2021 [5]
together with a rich set of insights based on the way it was organized, conducted
as well as the ﬁnal projects and participants’ impressions. As project lifespan,
and thus learning, after hackathons is limited because of motivation, follow-up,
project understanding, team-composition, technologies used as well as a myriad
of other factors [7] we decided to address some of these issues in this second
edition.

First of all, we have built a clear set of guidelines and instructions in collabo-
ration with our domain-speciﬁc expert partner institution - the Goethe-Institut.
The same guidelines served to evaluate the projects after their completion. Next,
keeping the learning and inclusivity in mind, we have enabled the participants to
request features and changes to the hackathon formula prior to its launch. This
resulted in lowering a barrier to entry, as the potential participants requested
an additional track to enable them to participate without the requirement of
having a functional VR headset at home.

Therefore, we added the second track devoted to AR projects, without any
explicit hardware or framework but with a suggested broad pro-environmental
theme. In addition to this track, we had the default VR track we have previously
planned, which used our pre-fabricated custom VR framework to enable the par-
ticipants to easily skip the basic and repetitive programming requirements and
make the choice of technologies and the related trade-oﬀs a non-issue [10]. Fi-
nally, we provided opportunities to active and willing participants to develop
the projects further under the mentorship of experts in the ﬁeld of XR devel-
opment. Such extended, post-event mentorship, going beyond even the active
participation of the mentor in the teams’ decision making processes [8], can be a
valuable asset to the participants. The opportunity to pursue follow-up work is
well-aligned with participants’ prevailing motivation connected to learning new
things [1].

Therefore, in this case study, which falls well within the recent trends of
research-oriented hackathons [2], we report the analysis, further insights and
lessons learned from organizing a language and culture-oriented XR hackathon
with Goethe-Institut. We refer to the beneﬁts of using a provided technological
framework as well as an extensive set of expert guidelines and evaluation criteria,
both of which solved some of the problems we have faced in the previous edition
of the hackathon.

2.1 Key information

The hackathon was hosted as an online event on the 28-29.11.2020 by the XR
Lab of the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in collaboration
with Goethe-Institut and Kobo Association as a follow-up to our previous co-
organized event [5]. To launch and end the event as well as communicate key
information we used MS Teams, which was familiar to our students their online
classes were conducted on the same platform. During the hackathon participants
communicated with each other and with mentors using a dedicated Discord
server. Additionally, the launch and end of the hackathon, including ﬁnal project
presentations, were broadcast using Instagram stories.

2.2 Organization

AR track vs VR track with a Starting Framework The hackathon allowed
for a choice of two technology tracks - one for AR, and one for VR. There
were clear diﬀerences between them, as the AR track had a lower barrier to
entry (no need to have a VR headset) and allowed the participants to use any
technology of their choice. The project topic in this track had to fall within a
broader pro-environmental theme. In the VR path the participants’ task was
to use a custom VR Framework, programmed by our XR Lab, to create an
application for learning German with the use of modern immersive methods.
The provided framework was dedicated for the Unity environment and consisted
of the following parts:

– Scenes: MainMenu (interactive about and credits board, a player tutorial for
teleportation, interacting with objects (doors, grabbing) and instructions for
creating new scenes.

– Prefabs: Avatar (character animations for idle and talking) and Player (con-
taining everything needed to navigate in VR, including hand scripting)
– Scripts: ControllerHints, HandManager (controllers), PickupManager (inter-
acting with grabbable objects), Interactable (class for objects one can inter-
act with using the laser), HighlightChanger (to highlight objects which are
pointed at), HighlightMode, HighlightColors, Grabbable (for objects that
can be picked up with the hand or the laser) and TeleportArea (to map
where the player can teleport to)

The framework was accompanied by a comprehensive, 12-page manual out-
lining key functionalities, requirements and instructions for installing the devel-
opment environment components, such as SteamVR, Unity 2018 or 2019 and
the framework repository ﬁles.

Project Presentation The projects were submitted to each team’s own folder
on Google Drive. Each submission was to include a short video recording present-
ing the eﬀect of work (gameplay, assets, features etc) as well as a text ﬁle with
a link to the project’s repository on GitHub. The on-air 5 to 15-minute presen-
tation of the project, the video as well as live commentary by the participating
teams.

Judging Criteria and Jury For this hackathon, as the focus of our default
track was culture- and language-oriented we have crated an extensive set of
evaluation criteria with a description of each one, as shown in Fig 4. Seven judges,
experts in diﬀerent areas including languages, research, IT, VR-development and
art, could grant 0, 0.5 or 1 points to each project in each criterion depicted in 4.
Additionally, each judge had the ability to grant up to 2 additional points to the
projects they liked the most, provided they created their own criteria to justify
their choice. The judging process was constructed this way to test the evaluation
criteria chosen for this activity, as well as to enable the judges to form their own
criteria, which could replace some of the existing criteria with low predictive
value, or be added to the evaluation process in the future events.

3 Results

3.1 Teams and Tracks

The event was attended by 4 teams - including university and high school stu-
dents. Each team consisted of at least 1 programmer and 1 artist to provide
team diversity and transdiciplinarity, as per best practices [7]. The minimum
number of people in a team was 3 and the maximum 6. Five teams signed up
for the Hackathon, four took part in the competition, three of which completed
the project with participant count of 6, 6 and 5 in each of them. Team num-
ber 2 resigned during the competition, as they could not ﬁnish the project to a
satisfactory degree. All of the teams that successfully completed the hackathon
were from the VR track. Here, one limitation of the online event was connected
to granting appropriate space and time for ice-breaking activities and team for-
mation facilitated by social preferences of the participants [12].

3.2 Judging Criteria

The results of the evaluation can be seen in Fig 5. The categories of Believable,
Interactive and Implicit, as explained in Fig 4, failed to produce suﬃciently dif-
ferent scoring results, with the standard deviation between all projects and all
judges for these criteria at 0.19, 0.16 as well as 0.21. Similar results were obtained
from interviews with the judges after the judging process, as they remarked that
these criteria were either redundant (interactive, as VR by default is interac-
tive), too general (believable) or easily achievable, thanks to prior instructions
(Implicit Learning). Other criteria that the judges have speciﬁed themselves
were: graphics (4 times), innovative idea (3 times) and one time for each: mood,
humour, functionalities, eﬀects and potential.

3.3 Winning teams and outcomes

First place The winning project, created by team 1, was inspired by the at-
mosphere of traditional German outdoor festivals. This project was the most
developed visually, relying on a visually-pleasing environment with atmospheric
lightning, ambient music and custom models. The scene takes place in a night
setting, in a park area where a festival is located. The player starts out in front of
a gate leading into the festival grounds, surrounded by trees and warm lightning
from torches and ﬁreplaces. After interacting with the gate it opens, showing
an alley with multiple tents and characters in fairytale-like costumes consist-
ing of a cloak and a mask. Inside each tent there is a diﬀerent minigame based
on traditional childhood games widespread in Germany, such as Topfschlagen
(heat-cold), Ein, Zwei, Drei... Halt! (Baba Yaga is watching) and Feuer-Wasser-
Sturm-Blitz (ﬁre-water-air-ground). The avatars instruct the player in German
on how to proceed with each game; there are no subtitles to focus on improving
listening competence. After ﬁnishing all games, all the NPCs move to a big bon-
ﬁre located at the end of the alley, where an eﬃgy is burned. The team received
49 points from the pre-determined evaluation criteria, as well as additional 3.5

points for graphics, 2.5 points for the idea, 1 for the mood, 1 for eﬀects, and 0.5
for the potential.

Second place The premise used for this project (by the team number 3) was
a situation when an angry German mother is forcing the user to perform house-
hold chores, shouting the instructions in German. The environment conveyed
the local atmosphere in a humorous way, with the mother dressed in traditional
German apparel and over-the-top decorations in the interior (such as bedsheets
with the German national ﬂag or Rammstein poster on the wall). When pick-
ing up each object, its name was displayed in German, allowing the user to
check the vocabulary. The quality of performance inﬂuenced the behaviour of
the mother avatar, who reacted verbally in response to the user’s interactions
with objects, saying sentences such as “what are you doing?!” in the case of mis-
takes or “that’s my son!” when the task was done correctly. The environment
resembled an apartment with multiple chores to perform in diﬀerent rooms. In
the bedroom, the user had to pick up objects from the ﬂoor and place it in ap-
propriate locations, e.g. dirty clothing in a clothing basket. In the kitchen there
were dirty dishes to wash using a sponge. The environment was fully functional
and interactive, with features such as a script allowing dirty clothing to spawn
in a randomized way. The team grounded the application in a mnemonic device
of associating information with an unusual or weird situation, which facilitates
memorizing. They also presented ideas for the future development of the app,
listing possible additional functionalities and further improvements. The team
received 37.5 points from the pre-determined evaluation criteria, as well as 1 for
humour, 1 for functionalities, and 0.5 for potential.

Third place Team number 4 decided to make a game about cooking national
German dishes (cooked sausage with potatoes). They created a scenario de-
scribed as “You live in a cozy house near Munich, you’re expecting friends for
dinner tonight. Cook the best sausages with potatoes according to your great-
grandmother’s recipe”. They created a virtual kitchen in which the user had to
accomplish the task of cooking traditional German sausages with potatoes ac-
cording to instructions in German displayed above the kitchen worktop. Next to

instructions there was a timer counting down the time left to ﬁnish each stage.
Ingredients had to be found inside a fridge, put on a frying pan and into a pot
(which needed to be ﬁlled with water from the tap) placed on the stove and
served on a platter. Although it was not clearly visible in the prototype due
to the time constraints, the environment was intended to imitate a traditionally
furnished German kitchen and convey the atmosphere of local culture. The team
intended to extend the simulation with other recipes from the German cuisine.
The team received 29 points from the pre-determined evaluation criteria and no
additional points.

4 Discussion and Conclusions

In this article we reported a case study of a Language and Culture-oriented VR
hackathon with Goethe-Institut which was conducted online. Overall, in compar-
ison to our previous Hackathon, the projects presented during this edition were
more advanced, allowing for greater interaction and immersion. We improved
the formula of the event based on lessons learned from its previous edition and
based on this experience we oﬀer additional considerations:

1. First, we provided the participants with the ability to add their own
technology track to mitigate one of the biggest barriers related to having
specialized VR equipment at hand. Yet, in our case, granting the participants
more freedom did not work. The team in this track, despite having suggested
this track themselves, did not ﬁnish their project, as likely they lacked the
starting point provided by a pre-deﬁned framework and limiting technology
options.

2. Next, for our default track we have created a custom VR framework, to
serve as a starting point for the participants’ designs to skip the
repetitive early development stage. Based on our pre-hackathon experi-
ence and questions we recommend to add a test-run of the said framework at
least one day before the hackathon with a small ”quest” to complete involv-
ing all the technical skills needed to take part in the hackathon. The results
of the quest project would not count towards the hackathon scoring. We are
also considering developing the framework further based on participant feed-
back, especially to include more ready-made scripts to enable a greater range

10

Kope´c et al.

of interactions, without limiting the participants’ creativity by providing sets
of assets directed at a certain interpretation of the tasks. In general, the use
of programming frameworks is widespread in professional projects - therefore
we recommend this as a good practice during hackathons. Hackathon orga-
nizers, thanks to such provided framework, could better match the direction
of participants’ eﬀorts to the hackathon goal.

3. Finally, for this hackathon we outlined best modern research-backed language-
learning practices and methods and gathered them into actionable eval-
uation criteria to ensure better understanding of the goal. When-
ever expert knowledge and practices are expected to be exhibited by non-
professionals, such as in this case philology and methodology studies, it is
advisable to brieﬂy and clearly state the scope and expectations derived from
subject expertise. In our case, we evaluated our criteria against their perfor-
mance and have come up with an improved set for this speciﬁc purpose. The
best criteria were: engagement, culture, discovery, experiential, immersive
and communicative as explained in Fig 4 – to these criteria we would add:
graphics, innovative idea as well as potential for the project development.

We recommend the steps of providing a starting framework and extending
expert evaluation criteria, to encourage the creation of more advanced projects,
as well as to improve the experience of hackathon participation for the teams
- which in general thanks to these practices which allow them to focus their
creativity within a smaller range of possibilities, produce much better results.
These are especially important for online events, where direct com-
munication within teams as well as with experts and mentors may
be more diﬃcult - as such, then these solutions provide an easy and
common reference point.
