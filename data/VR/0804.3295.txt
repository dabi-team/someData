Abstract For the ﬁrst time high-resolution optical spectroscopy of the variable star
V2324 Cyg associated with the IR-source IRAS 20572+4919 is made. More than 200
absorption features (mostly Fe II, Ti II, Cr II, Y II, Ba II, and Y II) are identiﬁed
within the wavelength interval 4549–7880 ˚A. The spectral type and rotation veloc-
ity of the star are found to be F0 III and V sin i = 69 km/s, respectively. H I and
NaI D lines have complex P Cyg-type proﬁles with an emission component. Neither
systematic trend of radial velocity Vr with line depth Ro nor temporal variabil-
ity of Vr have been found. We determined the average heliocentric radial velocity
Vr=−16.8 ± 0.6 km/s. The radial velocities inferred from the cores of the absorp-
tion components of the Hβ and Na I wind lines vary from −140 to −225 km/s (and
the expansion velocities of the corresponding layers, from about 120 to 210 km/s).
The maximum expansion velocity is found for the blue component of the split Hα
absorption: 450 km/s for December 12, 1995. The model atmospheres method is
used to determine the star’s parameters: Tef f =7500 K, log g = 2.0, ξt = 6.0 km/s,
and metallicity, which is equal to the solar value. The main peculiarity of the chem-
ical abundances pattern is the overabundance of lithium and sodium. The results
cast some doubt on the classiﬁcation of V2324 Cyg as a post-AGB star.

1. Introduction

The poorly studied star V2324 Cyg (visible magnitude V=11.m63, color
indices
B−V=+1.m09 and U−B=+0.m58, and galactic coordinates l=89.o44, b=2.o39) is an op-
tical counterpart of the IR-source IRAS 20572+4919. The observed 12–60 µm ﬂux of the
star and its location on the IR color-color diagram suggest that this object is a candidate
young planetary nebula with a dust envelope [1].

According to current theories (see, e.g., [2]) objects observed during the short-lived
evolutionary stage of young planetary (protoplanetary) nebulae (pPN) are intermediate-
mass stars evolving oﬀ the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) toward the planetary nebula
phase. The initial mass of these stars lies in the interval 3–8 M⊙. During the preceding
AGB stage these stars have undergone essential mass loss in the form of powerful stellar
wind, so that the resulting protoplanetary nebula has the form of a degenerate carbon–
oxygen core with a typical mass of about 0.6M⊙ surrounded by an expanding gas-and-dust
envelope. The astronomers’ interest toward pPN is due, ﬁrst, to the fact that these objects

allow us to study the history of mass loss and, second, because they oﬀer us an unique

opportunity to observe the result of stellar nucleosynthesis, mixing, and dredge-up of the
products of nuclear reactions during the previous evolution of the star.

The particular attention of the astronomers towards pPN over the past decade yielded a
number of interesting results. The sample of pPN candidates was found to contain about a
dozen objects overabundant in heavy metals synthesized via neutronization of iron nuclei
under conditions of low neutron density (s-process). The physical conditions necessary for
eﬃcient s-process and subsequent dredge-up of the matter enriched in heavy nuclei can
be found just in stars at the AGB stage (for the history and modern understanding of the
problem see the review by Busso et al. [3]). An analysis of the spectra of the sample of pPN
objects showed that the expected overabundances of s-process elements are observed in
the atmospheres of those pPN stars whose atmospheres are carbon enriched and whose IR
spectra exhibit an emission at 21 µm [4, 5, 6, 7]. The overwhelming majority of pPN stars
exhibit neither carbon (O-rich stars), nor heavy-metal overabundance (see, e.g., [4, 8, 9]).
The correlation found between the overabundance of heavy metals in the star atmosphere
and the peculiarities of the IR spectrum of the star envelope should be explained, hence
the sample of well-studied pPNe should be extended.

We know little about the properties of the star V2324 Cyg. Arkhipova et al. [10, 11]
performed long-term UBV observations and found V2324 Cyg to be variable with an
amplitude of about 0.m3 in the U band and about 0.m2 in the V and B bands. The conclusion
made by Arkhipova et al. [11] about the absence of well-deﬁned pulsation periodicity in the
star’s light variations is of great importance. The above authors explain the photometric
variability of the star by the eﬀect of the stellar wind. The lack of pulsations was found
to be consistent with the rather early spectral type of the star – A3 I [11]. Note that
SIMBAD lists a diﬀerent spectral type – Sp = Fe. In the polarimetric survey [12] the source
IRAS 20572+4919 is classiﬁed as an object without polarization, and this fact may be
indicative of a spherical shape of the circumstellar shell. Hrivnak et al. [13] analyzed near-
IR spectra of a sample of pPN objects and pointed out the anomalous (ﬂat) form of the IR
spectrum and the lack of Brackett hydrogen lines in the spectrum of IRAS 20572+4919.
Kelly and Hrivnak [14], in their near-IR study of the pPN sample in the 2.1–2.3 µm
wavelength interval, classiﬁed the central star of the source as an F-type star and put it
among the small group of stars with a Brγ emission. Garcia-Lario et al. [15], who used
IR photometry to determine the evolutionary status of 225 IRAS sources, consider the
classiﬁcation of the IRAS 20572+4919 source as a “post-AGB” star to be tentative.

So far only low-resolution optical spectroscopy was performed for V2324 Cyg, however,
even low-resolution observations revealed the main peculiarities of the optical spectrum of
V2324 Cyg – NaI D-line emission and especially powerful emission in Hα. The Hα emission
was found more than 30 years ago [16]. Emission is naturally associated with the presence
of a circumstellar shell, which aﬀects Hα and NaI D-line proﬁles in the optical spectrum.
Recently, a 2˚A-resolution spectrum of V2324 Cyg has been published [17], which shows,
in particular, the presence of emission in the lines of the OI λ 7773 ˚A triplet.

In this paper we present the results of a spectroscopic monitoring of V2324 Cyg with
high spectral resolution performed with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences (SAO RAS). The aim of our study is
to detect the spectroscopic variability, analyze the velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere and
envelope of the star, determine the fundamental parameters, metallicity and chemical

composition, and reﬁne the evolutionary status of the star. In Section 1 we brieﬂy describes

the methods of observation and data reduction; in Section 3 we reports and analyzes the
results obtained, and ﬁnally in Section 4 we brieﬂy formulates the main conclusions.

2. Observations and data reduction

Our observations of V2324 Cyg were performed with the 6-m telescope of the SAO RAS.
The ﬁrst spectrum was taken in 1995 with a spectroscopic resolution of R=25000 with
the Lynx—echelle spectrograph [18] mounted in the Nasmyth focus. PFES combined
with a 1K×1K CCD, recorded the wavelength interval λλ 4720–6860 ˚A. The second spec-
trum was taken with the Primary Focus Echelle Spectrograph PFES [19] (R = 15000).
This spectrograph, combined with a 1K×1K CCD, recorded the wavelength interval λλ
4680–8590 ˚A. All the subsequent observations of the star we made in the Nasmyth focus
with NES echelle spectrograph [20], which provides a spectral resolution of R=60000.
Observations were performed using a large-format 2048×2048 CCD and with an image
slicer [20]. Table 1 lists the folowing data for each spectrum: date, average UT observing
time, integration time, wavelength interval, and the spectrograph employed.

We extracted the data from the two-dimensional echelle spectra using the modiﬁed [21]
context of MIDAS package. Cosmic-ray hits were removed via median averaging of two
spectra taken consecutively one after another. Wavelength calibration was performed using
the spectra of a hollow-cathode Th-Ar lamp. To perform subsequent reduction including
spectrophotometric and position measurements we used DECH20 [22] program.

3. Discussion of results

3.1. Peculiarities of the optical spectrum of V2324 Cyg

We obtained most of our spectroscopic data described in Table 1 with the limiting spec-
tral resolution R ≈ 0.1 ˚A. Even a preliminary examination of the high-resolution spectra
showed that V2324 Cyg is an F-type star with wide absorptions and P Cyg-type proﬁles for
some lines (in the recorded wavelength interval these are Hα, Hβ, D1 and D2 NaI lines).
Besides the expected emissions in Hα and in the lines of the NaD doublet, we found
another spectral peculiarity – the large widths of absorption lines, which is untypical for
a star with the post-AGB status.

Spectral type. Arkhipova and Ikonnikova [10] obtained an indirect estimate of the star’s
spectral type, B8–A2 Ib–II, based on the results of photometric observations. Pereira and
Miranda [17] found a later spectral type from a low-resolution spectrum, but report equally
high luminosity. The above authors chose the HD 842 star (an A9 I-type supergiant) from
the atlas of Jacoby et al.
[23] to be closest to V2324 Cyg in terms of spectrum. However,
the classiﬁcation of V2324 Cyg given by Pereira and Miranda [17] is not satisfactory for
two reasons:

1. The spectrum of V2324 Cyg reported by Pereira and Miranda [17] is also very similar
[23] – that of HD 64191 F0-3 III (the
to another spectrum of atlas of Jacoby et al.
δ Sct-type variable AD CMi). The depth ratio of the G-band to Hγ allows V2324 Cyg
to be classiﬁed even as an F5-type star, however, below we show that Balmer lines in
the spectrum of V2324 Cyg are anomalous.

2. The result of classiﬁcation may be distorted by the widths of absorptions [24], which

diﬀer strongly for V2324 Cyg and the comparison stars. The rotation velocities V sin i of

4

Klochkova et al.: V2324 Cyg—an F-type star with fast wind

V2324 Cyg, HD 842, and HD 64191 are equal to 69 km/s (as measured from our spectra),
16 km/s (also our estimate, but based on a spectrum adopted from ELODIE.3 [25] and
ELODIE.3.1 [26] libraries), and 12 km/s [27], respectively.

Our data allowed us to perform spectral classiﬁcation based on line intensity ra-
tios of neutral to ionized atoms. We primarily used numerous Fe I and some of the
Fe II absorptions. To build the calibration curves, we used the data from the atlas of
Klochkova et al. [28] and ELODIE.3 spectral libraries [25]. The latter paper is especially
convenient for us because it contains spectra with the lines of approximately the same
width as those in the spectrum of V2324 Cyg and we can directly compare their fragments
and proﬁles of lines and blends and compare the line depths rather than the equivalent
widths.

Within the spectral type F absorption depth ratios in the FeII/FeI line pairs decrease
from F0 to F8 and they are higher and decrease more abruptly for supergiants than
for main-sequence stars. The depth ratios for V2324 Cyg correspond to a spectral type
interval from A9–F0 V to F8–G0 I. The supergiant option must be rejected, because it
would imply too large line depths for the depth ratios in question.

The spectra of ELODIE.3 library [25] for stars with rotation velocities in the 60
to 80 km/s interval – HD 58923 (F0 III), HD 47072 (F0 II), HD 432 (F2 III(IV)), and
HD 219877 (F3 IV) – reproduce our spectra of V2324 Cyg fairly well. The above stars
have bona ﬁde parallaxes (ranging from 9 to 60 mas according to HIPPARCOS catalog)
and direct estimates of their absolute magnitudes yield 0.2< Mv <2.8m. These estimates
are consistent with the MK spectral types for the three stars and the only exception is
HD 47072 whose parallax is indicative of a III–IV luminosity class.

A comparison of the mean central depths Ro of absorption lines averaged over the
spectra of the comparison stars mentioned above with the mean depths averaged over our
spectra of V2324 Cyg show that, with a few strongest lines excluded, these averaged Ro
agree within errors to both for FeI and FeII. It is thus safe to assume that V2324 Cyg
is an early F-type giant or subgiant. We estimate the spectral type more accurately by
analyzing the dependences of the Ro(FeII)/Ro(FeI) ratios on spectral type Sp obtained
for stars of luminosity classes III and IV. Thus, e.g., the depth ratio for the pair of closely
located lines FeII(43) λ 4732 and FeI(554) λ 4737 decreases from 1.3 to 0.9, and that for
the FeII(40) λ 6433, FeI(62) λ 6431 blend, from 1.6 to 0.7 as one passes from F0 III to
F5 III. The corresponding ratios for V2324 Cyg are equal to 1.05 and 0.98, respectively.
Based only on moderate-intensity metal lines, we estimate the spectral type of V2324 Cyg
to be F2 III.

Spectral anomalies. Some of spectral features make V2324 Cyg diﬀer markedly from a
common early F-type giant. These are, ﬁrst and foremost, emissions in a number of lines.
In the wavelength interval accessible for us such emissions can be directly seen in Hα (see
Fig. 1) and in the NaI(1) doublet as red shifted components of their P Cyg-type proﬁles
(see Fig. 2). The peaks of emissions in NaI lines are cut by absorptions, however, we can
adopt r≈1.25 as the lower limit of residual intensity for D2 (Fig. 2). It follows from Fig. 1
that the peak of Hα emission in our spectra is higher than the continuum level at least
by a factor of three (and in two spectra, at least by a factor of four). A comparison of Hα
proﬁles in spectra taken at diﬀerent times is indicative of their variability: both the shape
and intensity of emission vary from one spectrum to another and so do the positions of

the emission and absorption peaks.

The Hβ also has a weak emission component whose intensity and position vary with
time (see Fig. 3). The presence of emission shows up in the asymmetry of the proﬁle. If
we cut the proﬁle into two parts by the vertical line Vr = 0, then its red part is raised
and the blue part, on the contrary, depressed. At Vr≈100 km/s the depth of the proﬁle
R≈ 0.1–0.2, and on August 20, 2003 it even reached the continuum level. At the same
time, the blue shifted core of absorption at Vr≈ −(100–200) km/s is deeper than the
corresponding feature in the spectra of any comparison star mentioned above (June 12,
2001 Ro ≈0.85).

The OI(1) λ 7774 blend in the low-resolution spectrum of Pereira and Miranda [17]
appears as emission, which is at least comparable to NaI(1) doublet in terms of intensity.
In our only spectrum taken on January 12, 2001 the OI(1) λ 7774 blend also appears to be
partly ﬁlled by emission: the equivalent width of the blend is W≈0.4 ˚A, which, according
to Faraggiana et al. [29] corresponds to luminosity class V for early F-subtypes and is
twice lower than for an average F2 III-type star.

Moreover, as we pointed out above, for comparing the depths of metal absorption lines
in the spectra of V2324 Cyg and those of comparison stars we discarded the strongest lines
– ﬁrst and foremost the FeII(42) and MgI(2) triplets. The average central depths Ro for the
comparison stars are ≈ 0.3, whereas for V2324 Cyg Ro(FeII)≈ 0.12 and Ro(MgI)≈ 0.16.
Almost all these lines are parts of close blends and dominate in these blends in the
spectra of normal stars. However, in the spectrum of V2324 Cyg these lines are weakened
and reduced to the level of other contributors (mostly FeI). We may try to attribute these
weaker intensities to the presence of emissions, however, this hypothesis fails to explain
why reduced intensity of the lines considered does not result in appreciable blueshifts of
FeII(42) and MgI(2) absorptions relative to weak and intermediate metal lines (like in the
case of the OI(1) triplet and in contrast to Hβ).

3.2. Radial velocities

The velocities that we discuss below are measured only from minimally blended lines.
Table 2 lists the main and in some cases also the blending components for these lines,
their central residual intensities r, and heliocentric radial velocities Vr.

We found no signiﬁcant date-to-date variations of the depths and velocities for selected
weak and intermediate (photospheric) absorptions. We cannot rule out low-amplitude
velocity variations (at a level of 1–2 km/s), but these variations may also be due to pul-
sations, binarity, or unaccounted systematic measurement errors. Therefore in Table 2 we
list for these stars only the mean Vr values averaged over the entire observational data.
For the Hβ, NaI(1), and Hα lines, which exhibited proﬁle variability, Table 2 gives the r
and Vr values for each observing date. For the latter two lines the “/” sign separates the
quantities corresponding to the absorption and emission components of their P Cyg-type
proﬁles.

The depths of selected photospheric absorptions in Table 2 lie in the interval
0.20<Ro <0.03. Radial velocity Vr does not exhibit appreciable systematic variation
with line depth Ro, thereby justifying the computation of the mean velocity Vr=−16.8 ±
0.6 km/s. This velocity must be close to the systemic velocity of the star, Vsys. No reli-
able determination of systemic velocity Vsys is available for V2324 Cyg, because no CO

molecular-band [30] or H2O maser [31] emission have been detected from the star.

6

Velocities inferred from the cores of the absorption components of the wind lines vary
with time. As is evident from Table 2, in the spectra containing Hβ and NaI D2 the ab-
sorption cores of these two lines yield close velocities, which vary from −140 to −225 km/s
(and the expansion velocities of the corresponding layers, from about 120 to 210 km/s).
The cores of Hα lines yield lower radial velocities: they vary from −180 to −280 km/s.
The highest expansion velocity (in the spectral domain recorded in our observations) is
estimated from the blue boundaries of Hα absorptions: it was as high as 450 km/s for the
blue component of split absorption measured on December 12, 1995.

3.3. Parameters and chemical composition of the atmosphere

Determination the fundamental parameters from spectroscopic data and of the elemental
abundances are diﬃcult to perform in case of V2324 Cyg because of the large width of
absorptions in its spectrum caused by large rotation velocity V sin i = 69 km/s. Below
we show that the errors of measured equivalent widths are the main contributors to the
uncertainty of the chemical composition.

We use the grid of model hydrostatic and LTE atmospheres for diﬀerent metallicity
values computed by Shulyak et al. [32] to determine the parameters of the star’s model
atmosphere – eﬀective temperature and surface gravity – needed to compute the chemical
composition and synthetic spectra. Fixing the main parameters – eﬀective temperature
Tef f and surface gravity log g – is known to be always the most diﬃcult part of the com-
putation of the chemical composition of a star. It is diﬃcult to use the photometric data
for the ﬁnding the eﬀective temperature for objects with uncertain evolutionary status
and hence with uncertain reddening. As we noted above, the H I Balmer-line proﬁles in
the spectrum of V2324 Cyg are distorted by variable emission. That is why we determined
the eﬀective temperature of the star from the condition that FeI abundance must be inde-
pendent on the excitation potential of the corresponding lines; chose the surface gravity
based on the condition of ionization balance for iron atoms and ions. The microturbulence
velocity ξt was determined from the condition that iron abundance must be independent
of line intensity. Because of the likely distortion of metal line proﬁles due to emission,
for the above procedures we selected only the lines, where such distortions were visually
small or lacking.

The validation criterion for the method is the lack of the dependence of the abundance
on the excitation potential of the corresponding lines for other chemical elements repre-
sented by numerous lines (ScII, TiII, CrII). Moreover, in the case of a bona ﬁde values of
the microturbulence velocity individual abundances must be independent on the equiva-
lent widths of the lines used in the computation. The typical accuracy of model parameters
for a star with eﬀective temperature of about 7500 K is ∆Tef f ≈ 200 K, ∆ log g ≈ 0.5 dex,
and ∆ξt ≈ 1.0 km/s. Table 3 lists the abundance errors due to the parameter errors men-
tioned above. From a comparison of the errors in Tables 3 and 4 one can see that the errors
of equivalent line width measurements are the main contributors to the uncertainties for
the most abundances.

The known test for the internal consistency of the inferred parameters consists in an
agreement between the observed and synthetic spectra. We compared the observed spec-
trum with the synthetic spectrum that we computed using the code of Shulyak et al. [32].
For computations we adopted the model atmosphere with solar chemical composition and

with the following parameters: Tef f = 7500 K, log g = 2.0, and ξt = 6.0 km/s. A compari-

Klochkova et al.: V2324 Cyg—an F-type star with fast wind

7

son of the observed and theoretical spectra (see examples in Figs. 4 and 5) demonstrates
their satisfactory agreement provided that we neglect HeI lines and the FeII(42) and
MgI(2) lines mentioned above, which are distorted by emission.

We adopted the oscillator strengths log gf and other atomic constants required for com-
puting the elemental abundances from VALD database [33, 34]. Table 4 lists the adopted
parameters of the model atmosphere Tef f = 7500 K, log g = 2.0, ξt = 6.0 km/s. We used
the solar chemical composition, with respect to which we compute the elemental abun-
dances of the star under study, from Asplund et al. [35]. We performed all our chemical
composition computations using the software developed by Shulyak et al. [32] and adapted
by the same authors to PCs operating under OS Linux. We computed plane-parallel LTE
models using the software described by Shulyak et al. [32] without hyperﬁne structure
and isotopic-shift corrections, which increase the widths of NiI and BaII lines.

The scatter of the elemental abundances inferred from the set of spectral lines is rather
small: the standard deviation σ does not exceed 0.3 dex (see Table 4). We determined
the parameters of the model atmosphere using only low and intermediate intensity lines
with equivalent widths W ≤ 0.25 ˚A, because the approximation of a state plane-parallel
atmosphere may inadequately describe the strongest spectral features. Moreover, some of
the strong absorptions in the spectrum could be distorted by the eﬀect of the circumstellar
shell. In the case of insuﬃcient resolution the intensities of the shell components add up to
the intensities of the components that form in the atmosphere. We computed the elemental
abundances for an extended set of spectral lines – for a number of elements (SiII, TiII,
FeI, FeII, BaII) we used lines with equivalent widths exceeding the equivalent-line width
limit mentioned above. Let us now analyze the chemical abundances by grouping elements
according to the type of their synthesis.

Light elements. As one might expect in the case of an evolved star, the abundances
of a number of light elements have changed. The overabundance of lithium computed
from the LiI line λ 6707 ˚A is immediately apparent. The equivalent width of this line was
measured with conﬁdence in all our spectra of V2324 Cyg and its averaged equivalent
width is W≥50 m˚A. We therefore consider the lithium overabundance [LiI/Fe]≥+0.68 to
be established beyond doubt. Figure 6 compares the observed and synthetic spectra of
the star in the region of the LiI 6707 ˚A line. We performed this computation with the
model-atmosphere parameters Tef f =7500 K, log g=2.0, and ξt=6.0 km/s and the elemen-
tal abundances listed in Table 4. This is the most interesting anomaly in the chemical
abundances pattern in the atmosphere of V2324 Cyg.

We ﬁnd a small underabundance of oxygen [O/Fe]=−0.12 combined with a small over-
abundance of carbon [C/Fe]=+0.35, implying an abundance ratio C/O> 1. Unfortunately,
the OI λ 5330.7, 6155.9, and 6158.1 ˚A oxygen lines employed are too weak and have their
equivalent widths determined with large errors because of the large widths of these lines
(in Table 4 the standard error for oxygen is σ = 0.28). Therefore the inferred oxygen
abundance is uncertain. No nitrogen lines were available in the wavelength interval cov-
ered by our observations and nitrogen abundance is of fundamental importance for the
determination of the evolutionary stage of the star. On the whole, concerning the CNO
triad the only certain result is the overabundance of carbon.

The sodium abundance was determined from the moderate intensity NaI λ 5682,
5688, and 6160 ˚A lines with small NLTE corrections
[36, 37]. Hence the sodium over-
abundance found, [Na/Fe]=+1.04, may be mostly due to the sodium synthesis in the

NeNa-cycle, which proceeds simultaneously with hydrogen burning in the CNO cycle.

8

The magnesium, whose abundance we determined from the two lines, MgI λ 4702.99 and
5528.40 ˚A, is also overabundant: [Mg/Fe]=+0.43. The sodium-to-magnesium abundance
ratio is [Na/Mg]=+0.61.

Iron-peak elements. The iron abundance, which is usually employed as the metallicity
indicator, does not diﬀer in the atmosphere of V2324 Cyg from the corresponding solar
abundance: log ε(FeI, FeII)=7.44. The reliably enough determined abundances of chro-
mium and nickel, which belong to the iron group, also diﬀer only slightly from the normal
values: [CrI,CrII, NiI/Fe]=−0.19. The solar metallicity of the star is consistent with the
systemic heliocentric velocity adopted in Section 2.2, V⊙ ≈ −17 km/s, which is typical of
Galaxy disk stars.

Heavy metals. The overabundance of barium with respect to iron, [Ba/Fe]=+0.46, is
something expected, but rarely found in the atmospheres of post-AGB supergiants. It
is much more common for atmospheres of these stars to exhibit overabundance of s–
process elements [5, 38]. However, we found no overabundance of yttrium, which is also
synthesized via slow neutronization. The overabundance of s-process elements or lack of
such overabundance depend on the initial mass of the star and on the mass-loss rate at
the AGB stage,which determine the evolution of the particular star and the mass of the
stellar core. Modeling of the third dredge-up process [39] shows that the eﬃciency of the
dredge-up of reaction products increases with the mass of the core (and hence with the
initial mas) of the post-AGB star. It also follows from Herwig’s computations [40] that
the eﬃciency of the dredge-up increases if we take into account penetrative convection at
the base of the convective zone.

Separation of chemical elements in the shell. As is well known, selective separation
of chemical elements in stars with gaseous-dusty shells may be an eﬃcient mecha-
nism producing anomalous elemental abundances. However, the solar iron abundance
for V2324 Cyg indicates that no condensation onto dust grains occurs in this shell, since
iron is an element that condenses eﬃciently onto dust grains. Further evidence is provided
by the normal zinc abundance, [Zn/Fe]=+0.09, which is consistent with the typical zinc
abundance [Zn/Fe]=+0.04 over a wide range of metallicities [41]. The lack of manifes-
tations of selective separation is diﬃcult to explain for a star with IR excess due to the
circumstellar shell.

Related objects. Earlier studied objects include pPN candidates with a chemical com-
position pattern similar to that found for V2324 Cyg. Arellano-Ferro et al. [42] ana-
lyzed a sample of post-AGB stars and found one of them—the hot star HD 172481
(IRAS 18384−2800)—also to be overabundant in lithium. The main parameters of this
star—Tef f = 7250 K and log g = 1.5—are also similar to those of V2324 Cyg. However, the
atmosphere of V2324 Cyg, unlike that of HD 172481, is overabundant with heavy metals.
Moreover, Reyniers and Van Winckel [43] suspected that HD 172481, unlike V2324 Cyg,
is a binary system and hence the two stars cannot be considered to be full analogs.

All parameters considered, the F-type star HD 331319 (the optical component of the
IRAS 19475+3119 source) is a closer analog of V2324 Cyg. This F-type star has close to
solar metallicity, it is overabundant in helium, oxygen, and light metals (Na, Si), while
being underabundant in titan and barium [8]. Like in the case of V2324 Cyg, the at-
mosphere of HD 331319, with Tef f =7200 K and log g = 0.5, is overabundant in lithium
[Li/Fe]=+0.62. It is interesting that Klochkova et al. [8] detected a HeI λ 5876 ˚A line with
the equivalent width of Wλ ≈ 38 m˚A in the spectrum of the F-supergiant HD 331319 and

concluded that helium in this star is of photospheric origin and hence the products of its

Klochkova et al.: V2324 Cyg—an F-type star with fast wind

synthesis have been dredged up during the evolution of the star. As for V2324 Cyg, we
cannot rule out that the HeI λ 5876 ˚A line may also be present in its spectrum, at least
at some observations. As one can see from Figure 4, where we compare the HeI λ 5876 ˚A
line in the spectrum of V2324 Cyg taken on June 12, 2001 with the synthetic spectrum
computed with parameters Tef f =7500 K, log g=2.0, ξt=6.0 km/s, the above situation is
possible. Neither of these two stars exhibits manifestations of selective separation of chem-
ical elements [42, 8].

However, despite their close eﬀective temperatures, metallicities, and details of chemical
composition, V2324 Cyg and HD 331319 diﬀer substantially in luminosity and rotation
velocity. Metal lines in the spectrum of HD 331319 are narrow and the star is of luminosity
class Ib, whereas lines in the spectrum of V2324 Cyg are broadened by rotation and it
is most likely of luminosity class III. The Hα proﬁles in the spectra of these two stars
also diﬀer signiﬁcantly. The Hα proﬁle in the spectrum of HD 331319 is typical of post-
AGB stars (see Fig. 1 in paper [8]), whereas the P Cyg-type proﬁle of the Hα line in the
spectrum of V2324 Cyg is closer to the corresponding proﬁles in the spectra of supergiant
stars. Recall that V2324 Cyg has a very high mass outﬂow velocity – it amounts to several
hundred km/s, which is one order of magnitude higher than the typical expansion velocities
of pPN envelopes.

There is another pPN candidate, which resembles V2324 Cyg in terms of spectral pe-
culiarities and chemical composition. We mean the spectroscopic binary BD+48o1220
which is the optical component of the IR-source IRAS 05040+4820. The variability of
the spectrum of this star has been recently discovered by analyzing the spectra obtained
with the 6-m telescope [44], and parameters and chemical composition for this star were
determined later [45]. Besides their close temperatures and abundances of a number of
chemical elements (solar metallicity, overabundance of lithium and sodium), the similar-
ity of BD+48o1220 and V2324 Cyg also shows up in the variability of proﬁles of metal
lines, which contain an emission component, and in the strong emission in the Hα line.
The hypothesis that BD+48o1220 and V2324 Cyg may be at close evolutionary stages is
also corroborated by the lack of spectral features in their radio spectra. However, these
two stars have a very important diﬀerence, namely, spectral classiﬁcation gives the lumi-
nosity class Ib for BD+48o1220. The surface gravities inferred via the method of model
atmospheres also diﬀer: log g=2.0 and 0.0 for V2324 Cyg and BD+48o1220, respectively.

3.4. The problem of luminosity and evolutionary status of V2324 Cyg

Kinematic distance determinations in the direction of V2324 Cyg (l≈89.o4, b≈2.o4) are
unreliable: radial velocity slightly depends on distance at least up to 2 kpc [46]. However,
color excess and equivalent widths of NaI(1) and DIB interstellar absorptions (see Table 5)
exhibit well deﬁned increasing with distance already within the local arm. Both param-
eters are appreciably smaller for V2324 Cyg than for the members of the large Cyg OB7
association the star projects on and which, according to Humphreys [47], is located at a
heliocentric distance of 0.8 kpc. A coarse estimate based on the above parameters yields
for V2324 Cyg a distance of d=0.5–0.6 kpc, implying a low luminosity of Mv ≈1.m6.
Spectrophotometric estimation based on our spectral type (F2III) and photometry by
Arkhipova and Ikonnikova [10] (V=11.m7 and B−V=1.m1) yields an even smaller dis-
tance, d=0.35–0.4 kpc. Such a low luminosity is also indicative of the low initial mass of

the star,which is inconsistent with the detected overabundance of lithium. According to

10

Klochkova et al.: V2324 Cyg—an F-type star with fast wind

Straniero et al. [48], lithium overabundance may arise during the evolution of the most
massive AGB stars with initial masses M ≈ 7M⊙.

However, lithium overabundance in the atmosphere of a low-luminosity star suggests us
an alternative evolutionary stage for V2324 Cyg. While analyzing possible mechanisms of
lithium enrichment of the Galactic interstellar medium, Romano et al. [49] focus attention
on the phenomenon of overabundance of Li in the atmospheres of F-type giants with IR
excesses. Some of these Li-rich giants, which have not yet reached the AGB stage and are
observed at the RGB, have low masses M < 2.5M⊙. As a mechanism for Li production
Romano et al. [49] suggest the “cool bottom process”, which is based on the production
of beryllium, its dredge-up toward the base of the convective envelope, and subsequent
decay down to lithium nuclei in the subsurface layers of the star. Here it is appropriate to
cite the recent paper by Jasniewicz et al. 50, who determined ε(Li) for a sample of solar
metallicity G–K giants and subgiants, and found that the highest ε(Li) is achieved for fast
rotating stars (V sin i ≥ 30 km/s). However, as we pointed out above, spectral features
in the form of emissions prevent us from adopting the red-giant status for the star under
study.

In conclusion, we have to admit that the evolution stage of V2324 Cyg remains unclear
despite the extensive amount of the data that we obtained. On the IR colour–colour
diagram IRAS 20572+4919 lies in domain IV populated by planetary and protoplanetary
nebulae. According to chronological sequences of Lewis [51], the lack of maser emission
in the OH and H2O bands [31] suggests that the system must be approaching the stage
of planetary nebula. This fact agrees with the conclusions of Garcia-Lario et al. [1] and
Arkhipova et al. [11] who consider V2324 Cyg as a post-AGB star. However, the post-
AGB stage is inconsistent with a number of properties of the star found as a result of our
research, ﬁrst and foremost, the low luminosity of the star: spectral classiﬁcation points
to luminosity class III. Here to the point to recall the paper [15], where the classiﬁcation
of the IRAS 20572+4919 source as a “post-AGB” star is considered as tentative.

The Hα proﬁle and very high wind velocity, which are usually found in supergiants, are
also inconsistent with the post-AGB status. We see the prospects for further reﬁnement of
the distance, mass, and nature of V2324 Cyg to be found in gathering data not only about
the object itself, but also about stars seen in the direction of the Cas OB7 association.

4. Conclusions

We performed high-resolution optical spectroscopy of the V2324 Cyg variable star – an
optical counterpart of the IR source IRAS 20572+4919. We identiﬁed more than 200
absorptions within the wavelength interval 4549÷7880 ˚A (these are mostly Fe II, Ti II,
Cr II, Y II, Ba II, and Y II lines) and determined the spectral type and rotation velocity
of the star to be F0 III and V sin i = 69 km/s, respectively. The main peculiarity of the
spectrum of the star are complex P Cyg-type proﬁles of the Hα and NaI D lines.

We analyzed 9 spectra taken in diﬀerent years (1995–2006) and failed to ﬁnd either
systematic trend of radial velocity Vr with line depth Ro, or temporal variability of Vr.
This result allowed us to adopt the mean value Vr=−16.8 ± 0.6 km/s as the systemic
velocity, Vsys ≈−17 km/s. We found velocities ranging from −140 to −225 km/s (and the
expansion velocities from about 120 to 210 km/s for the corresponding layers) from the

cores of the absorption components of the Hβ and NaI wind lines. We found the expansion

Klochkova et al.: V2324 Cyg—an F-type star with fast wind

11

velocity to be the highest for the blue component of the Hα split absorption: 450 km/s
for December 12, 1995.

By the model atmospheres method we determined the eﬀective temperature,
Tef f =7500 K, surface gravity log g = 2.0, microturbulence velocity ξt = 6.0 km/s, and
metallicity which appear to be equal to solar one. The main peculiarity of the chemi-
cal composition of V2324 Cyg is the overabundance of lithium and sodium.

The solar metallicity of the star combined with Vsys ≈−17 km/s allows us to classify
it as an object of the Galactic disk population. Main conclusion of this investigation is
the uncertainty of the evolutionary status of V2324 Cyg. Its properties are not entirely
consistent with either the post-AGB or RGB stage.

Table 4. Abundances ε(X) of elements in the atmosphere of V2324 Cyg. Here σ is the
standard deviation of the abundance and “n”, the number of lines used in the computation.
The computation was performed with the model-atmosphere parameters Tef f =7500 K,
log g = 2.0, and ξt = 6.0 km/s. The elemental abundances for the solar atmosphere are
adopted from [35]
