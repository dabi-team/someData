Abstract 

The  observations  of  the  two-periodic  magnetic  cataclysmic  system  EX  Hya  have  been 
carried  out,  using  the  telescopes  RC16  and  TOA-150  of  the  Tzec  Maun  observatory.  6  nights  of 
observations were obtained in 2010-2011 (alternatively changing filters VR). Also the databases of 
WASP, ASAS and AAVSO have been analyzed. Processing time series was carried out using the 
program MCV. We analyzed changes in the rotation period of the white dwarf, and based on our 
own  and  previously  published  moments  of  maximum.  The  ephemeris  was  determined  for  the 
maxima  of  the  radiation  flux  associated  with  the  rotation  of  the  magnetic  white  dwarf: 
Tmax=2437699.89079(59)  +0.0465464808(69).E-6.3(2) 
the 
characteristic timescale of the rotation spin-up of 4.67(14) .106 years. This contradicts the estimated 
value of the mass of the white dwarf of 0.42M , based on X-ray observations made by Yuasa et al 
(2010), however, is consistent with estimates of the masses of 0.79 M (white dwarf) and 0.108 M 
(red  dwarf)  previously  published  by  Beuermann  and  Reinsch  (2008),  and  the  assumption  that the 
capture  of  accreted  plasma  by  magnetic  field  of  the  white  dwarf  is  near  the  border  of  the  Roche 
lobe. Analyzed moments do not support the assumption of Mauche et  al  (2009) for a statistically 
significant  cubic  term  in  the  ephemeris.  Despite  the  presence  of  outbursts  in  EX  Hya,  there  are 
significant differences from the DO Dra, which supports the introduction to a detailed classification 
of  the  intermediate  polars  the  groups  of  "outbursting  intermediate  polars"  and  "magnetic  dwarf 
novae."

Introduction 

Intermediate  polars,  often  called  DQ  Her  star,  are  interacting  binary  systems  with  strong 
magnetic fields [1-3]. Gravity of the white dwarf leads to the gravitational capture of the part of the 
substance  of  the  secondary  component  near  the  inner  Lagrange  points.  Due  to  the  Coriolis  force, 
plasma  flux  deviates  from  the  center  line  and  forms  an  accretion  disk  around  a  white  dwarf.  A 
strong magnetic field destroys the inner part of the disk and leads to the formation of two accretion 
columns, which are one of the brightest sources of radiation in a wide spectral range from x - ray to 
infrared. The cyclotron radiation is characterized by the presence of polarization. The matter forms 
a  shock  wave  heats  up  and  settles  on  the  surface  of  the  white  dwarf.  Hot  gas  emits 
«bremsstrahlung» radiation in the hard (up to 50 Kev) X-ray range. Rare outbursts are possible (e.g. 
DO  Dra  [4]).  Usually  intermediate  polars  were  classified  as  nova-like  stars  with  relatively  small 
changes in average per night light (up to 1-2 magnitude).

EX Hya was firstly noted as a variable star in the catalogue of Brun and Petit in 1957 [5]. 
Later  it  was  continued  to  be  classified  as  a  dwarf  nova  (e.g.  [6]).  Papaloijzuu  and  Pringle  [7]  in 
1980  noted  that  the  ratio  of  photometric  periods  is  close  to  the  2:3,  Warner  and  Mac-Grau  [8] 
discussed two models  -  modulation of the  mass  flow and  the  magnetic  white dwarf (intermediate 
polar). Then, the object was classified either as dwarf nova, or as an intermediate polar [9], as the 
system displays characteristics of both classes of cataclysmic variables. We can talk about a group 
of «magnetic dwarf novae» or «outbursting intermediate polars» [4]. 

In this paper, we study variations of the rotation (spin) period of the white dwarf in the EX 
Hydra system. This work is part of the international project «Inter-Longitude Astronomy» [10] and 
the national project «Ukrainian Virtual Observatory» [11]. 

Observations 

Observations  were  carried  out  using  remotely-controlled  telescopes  TOA150  (15cm)  and 
BigMak  (35cm)  at  the  Tzec  Maun  observatory  (http://tzecmaun.org/).  We  obtained  5  nights  of 
observations in 2010 and 1 night in 2011, 129 expositions in the V filter and 118 in the filter Rc. For 
processing  of  CCD  frames,  we  used  the  program  MuniWin  (http://c-munipack.sourceforge.net/, 
http://munipack.astronomy.cz/). To improve the accuracy of measurements  of brightness, we used 
the  technique  of  “multiple  comparison  stars”,  described  in  [12,  13]  and  implemented  in  the 
computer program MCV (http://uavso.pochta.ru/mcv). 

We  obtained  the  tables  of  measurements  of  object  and  comparison  stars.  Journal  of 
observations  is  presented  in  the  Table  1.  Comparison  stars  are  marked  in  the  Fig.1,  a  list  of  the 
characteristics defined by A. Henden (ftp://ftp.aavso.org/public/calib/exhya.dat), are shown in table 
2.  As  the  primary  calibration  star,  we  used  C1.  It’s  magnitude  was  assumed  to  be  Rc=11.854m. 
Unfortunately,  for  other  comparison  stars,  the  measurements  in  this  photometric  system  are 
missing.  The  definition  of  coefficients  of  relation  between  the  standard  and  instrumental 
photometric  systems  is  impossible  at  this  stage.  Although  we  observed  in  two  filters,  and  light 
curves  were  plotted  in  the  instrumental  systems  V,  Rc,  bringing  the  color  indices  to  the  standard 
system it is impossible at this stage. However, our observations could be used in further works after 
calibration.

Photometric observations

In the journal of observations is given for all nights. An example of the light curve obtained 

for one of the nights is shown in Fig.2. We choose 2-periodic model of variability for smoothing: 

m(t)=m0-r1cos(1(t-T01)) -r2cos(2(t-T02))                                                     (1) 

where  m(t)  -  is  the  smoothed  value  of  brightness  at  time  t,  m0  -  average  brightness  of  theoretical 
function (generally different from the sample mean, see, e.g. reviews [14,15]), j=2/Pj, rj  - semi-
amplitude, T0j is the epoch for maxima of brightness (magnitude minima) of photometric wave with 
number  j  and  period  Pj.  Similar  approximation  was  used  during  the  study  of  other  intermediate 
polars,  e.g.  BG  CMi  [16],  MU  Cam  [17].  We  discovered  [17]  the  phenomenon  of  variability  of 
phase of maximum of photometric wave associated with the rotation of the white dwarf, on orbital 
phase in MU Cam. From a theoretical point of view, this could be interpreted by modulation of the 
accretion  flow  structure  by  the  magnetic  field  of  a  rapidly  rotating  white  dwarf.  From  the 
observational  point  of  view,  this  indicates  a  necessity  of  using  (for  the  study  of  slow  changes  of 
phase) «mean maxima» (averaged values over the orbital period). Thus, the formula (1) is optimal 
for  approximation  of  observations  of  intermediate  polars,  although  for  some  of  them  (e.g.  V405 
Aur), it is necessary to take in account harmonics of the first and/or second periods. 

As we took short intervals of observations for smoothing, we used published earlier  values 
of the periods P1=Porb=0.068233846d (orbital period), P2=Prot=0.046546504d (rotation period of the 
white dwarf). Below we examine the period variations.

Fig.  3.  Periodogram  of  EX  Hya  near  the  rotation  period  of  the  white  dwarf.  Maximum  peak 
corresponds to a period of 0d.046546. 

To determine the period for own observations, we conducted a periodogram analysis using a 
sine wave approximation [18,14]. Test-function S(f), where the trial frequency  f=1/P, is shown in 
Fig.  3.  The  highest  peak  corresponds  to  a  period  of  0d.046546.  Other  high  peaks  are  shifted  in 
frequency by ±k cycles per day, where k is an integer. 

Additionally,  we  analyzed  observations  from  AAVSO  (31908  observations  JD  2434847-
2455769), ASAS (688 observations JD 2451870-2455057), WASP (77 observations, JD 2453922-
2454307) databases. 

Periodograms on these data show low peaks, and the phase of the light curves do not show a 

good curve, which indirectly confirms the assumption about the variability of the period. 

Calculation of Phases in the Case of a Variable Period 

In the simplest case of a constant period P, each moment of time t corresponds to an integer 
cycle number j and phase , which can be calculated using the formula E=j+=(t-T0)/P, where T0 is 
the  initial  epoch  and  P  is  the  period  (e.g.  [19]),  i.e.,  t=T0+PE.  Although  the  period  EX  Hya  are 
being studied for many decades, for obtaining the phase curves, are commonly used the values of 
the period and the initial epoch obtained for a short interval of observations. In the specific case of 
EX Hya, as well as the general case of the use of observations from the surveys, the calculation of 
phase  for  variable  period  curves  and  study  phase  curves  for  long  term  observations,  becomes  an 
actual topic. Therefore, we give the explicit form of the formula, which we used earlier in [12, 16] 
without a detailed description. 

In the case of a variable period, one of the most common methods of research is the method 
of “O-C” diagrams that use only moments of typical events (minima of eclipsing stars, maxima of 
pulsating  stars  etc.).  Moments  are  published  in  separate  articles.  The  compiled  database  for 
hundreds  of  eclipsing  stars  is  presented  in  a  six-book  monograph  [20].  In  recent  years,  the

via 

the 

Parameters of variability are usually defined by modeling the deviations of moments of the 

characteristic events from a linear ephemeris, e.g. 

O-C=T(E)-(T00+P0E)=Q0+Q1E+Q2E2+Q3E3+..+QnEn+U(E)                            (2)

6 

Here U(E) may be, e.g., periodic components associated with the presence of the third (and more) 
body in the system like stars or planets. The instantaneous value of the period 

P(E)=dT(E)/dE=P0+Q1+2Q2E+3Q3E2+..+nQnEn-1+dU(E)/dE                        (3) 
This is slightly different from  «differential» definitions  PK(E)=(T(E+1)-T(E)) by  Kopal and Kurtz 
[21].  For  differentiable  functions  P(E),  using  the  Lagrange  formula,  it  is  possible  to  get 
PK(E)=P(E+(E)). Here 0≤(E)≤1 is the correction to the cycle number, which can be 0.5 in case of 
dP/dE=2Q2=const. In general case of slow changes of the period, |dP/dE|<<P, P(E)PK (E-0.5), and 
functions are almost the same. We use «instant» period for analysis. 

Using the values of the coefficients of the equation (3), obtained when modeling the «special 
points», one can determine the value of E for an arbitrary point in time. Theoretically, this means 
solution of the equation T(E)=t, however, in practice, it is possible to find the inverse function E(t) 
analytically only for the simplest cases. So the preferred is numerical method of iterations:  

E0=(t-T0)/P0,  

Ek+1=Ek - (t-T(Ek))/P(Ek)                                                                             (4) 

Obviously, if the right part is zero, only one initial approximation is necessary, in which we 
obtain the classical formula for a constant period. For polynomial models of degree higher than 2, 
we  used  this  method  in  the  study  of  the  intermediate  polar  BG  CMi  [16]  and  others. 
In uniform (in respect to the cycle number E) period variation dP/dE=2Q2, 

t(E) =T0+P0E+Q2E2

 ,                                                                              (5) 

and it’s possible to get the inverse function E(t) as the solution of a quadratic equation T(E)=t:

Analysis of variability of the rotation period of the white dwarf 

Previous analysis was made by Mauche et al. [23]. They published an ephemeris:

As the initial epoch, we have used the earliest timing in our list T00= 2437699.8920 (Vogt et 
al. 
[23]). 
Since the period variation is significant, the sequence of cycles should be corrected by one or even 
two cycles, which is indicated in the appropriate column of the Table. 1  [24]. Using the program 
MCV  [12],  we  determined  the  statistically  optimal  degree  of  the  polynomial  for  the  O-C 
approximation. It is equal to two. Parameter Q3 is not statistically significant, i.e. considerably more 
data  do  not  confirm  the assumption  by  Mauche  et  al.  [23].  Using  specified  data,  we  obtained  the 
ephemeris 

(Mauche  et  al.

Thus, on the specified time interval of 49  years, the deviations from the model of  uniform period 
change are not statistically significant.

O-C diagram and it’s ±1, ±2error corridors are shown on Fig. 4. Note that the errors of 
smoothing curve were calculated using correct formulae taking into account the covariance matrix 
of  the  errors  of  the  coefficients  rather  than  reduced,  taking  into  account  only  the  errors  of  the 
coefficients (see [18,15]). 

Using  the  coefficients  of  the  resulting  relation  (10),  we  calculated  the  phases  using  the 
formulae (6,8). The obtained phase curves according to the ASAS, TzecMaun V and R and AAVSO 
data are shown in Fig. 5. The first 3 curves correspond to the minima m~13.5m, and show almost 
sinusoidal shape. Significant scatter on the phase curve is due to not only errors of observation, but 
also to a significant orbital variability, comparable in amplitude with the  spin one. Some AAVSO 
observations  show  outbursts  up  to  9.3m,  however,  a  series  of  observations  during  the  night 
correspond to the level of 10.5m. 

The  amplitude  of  the  sine  changes  in  the  bright  state  (at  an  outburst)  is  the  same  (about 
0.3m), as in a low state. This is consistent with the assumption that the brightening of the accretion 
disk and accretion column occurs approximately in proportion. 

The significant shift of the maximum phase by phase-0.2 during the outburst is to be noted. 
A similar effect of the negative phase shift with increase of brightness is observed in the eclipsing 
polar  OT  J071126.0+440405  =  CSS  081231:071126+440405  [26,27]  and  is  explained  by  the 
smaller distance, at which plasma is captured by the magnetic field, when the mass flow increases. 

Two  light  curves  obtained  during  the  outburst,  slightly  differ,  as  seen  in  Fig.  5. 
Unfortunately, because of such differences, a detailed comparison of the characteristics of the light 
curves  at  minimum and maximum  is  impossible, and in the future, the  observations  during  a rare 
outbursts are required. Theoretical models of outbursts are discussed by Mhahlo et al [28].

Discussion 

EX Hya belongs to ourbursting intermediate polars, and the periodicity associated with the 
rotation of the white dwarf, is well expressed. This differs from DO Dra, often  mistakenly  called 
YY  Dra,  where  strict  periodicity  is  absent.  However,  sometimes  there  are  «transient  periodic 
oscillations»  [4],  a  period  which  varies  from  night  to  night,  and,  probably,  connected  with 
interaction  of  plasma  clouds  on  the  inner  part  of  the  accretion  disk  with  the  magnetic  field  of  a 
rapidly rotating white dwarf. 

Thus, we can conclude that the accretion columns above the atmosphere of the white dwarf 
in EX Hya are much more powerful (relatively to other sources of radiation), than DO Dra. Due to 
this,  EX  Hya  should  be  classified  as  an  “outbursting  intermediate  polar”,  and  DO  Dra,  as  a 
“magnetic  dwarf  nova”.  Despite  the  existence  of  outbursts  in  both  systems,  which  differ  from 
outbursts from the «non-magnetic» U Gem type dwarf novae stars, a distinction between systems is 
present, and the subtype classification should be used. 

The characteristic time of the change of the period (acceleration of rotation) 
=P0/|dP/dt|=P0

2/|2Q2|=4.67(14) .106 years                                                   (11) 

This  is significantly more than  the  synchronization time  s =96.7±1.5  and time of period changes 
=3.5(1).104  for  V1432  Aql  [29]  and 
than    for  BG  CMi  [16].  
It should be noted that some systems for decades does not show a statistically significant change of 
the period (e.g. 1RXS J180340.0+401214 = RXJ 1803 = V1323 Her), and unsolvable riddle about 
the failure of the phase fluctuations (on data from other author) for 0.5 period was connected with 
the  fact  that  the  authors  of  one  of  the  published  articles  did  not  consider  that  the  «maximum 
brightness» corresponds to the «minimum magnitude» [30].

Other  intermediate  polars  show  for  decades  either  an  increase  of  the  period,  or  its 

subsequent decrease (e.g. FO Aqr [31], V405 Aur [32]). 

According  to  current  theoretical  models  (e.g.  [33]),  the  change  of  the  equilibrium  spin 
period  occurs  at  essentially  higher  characteristic  time  of  billions  years.  Thus,  the  observed 
acceleration  of  the  rotation  is  a  short-term  phenomenon.  If  it  was  associated  with  the  suddenly 
increased mass flow, it should be associated with an increased flux of radiation. The light curve has 
outbursts,  however,  they  are  numerous,  and,  due  to  the  inertia  of  the  white  dwarf,  a  temporary 
increase  in  flow  during  outbursts  leads  to  a  transient  increase  in  luminosity,  but  the  long-term 
period change is affected by the average level of accretion only. 

Change  of  the  equilibrium  period  with  characteristic  time  of  hundreds  of  years  can  be 
attributed  to  fluctuations  in  the  accretion  rate  due  to  the  magnetic  activity  of  the  secondary 
component  -  red  dwarf  (Bianchini  [34],  Andronov  and  Shakun  [35])  or  by  small  changes  in  the 
distance  between  components  due  to  gravity  of  low-mass  third  body  (e.g.  red  or  brown  dwarf) 
(Andronov  and  Chinarova  [36]).  Another  mechanism  of  change  of  the  equilibrium  period,  which 
can take place at constant accretion rate, is the precession of the rotation axis of the magnetic white 
dwarf([37], [38], [39]). 

On the website http://www.ukaff.ac.uk/movies.shtml, there is animated model of the system  
EX Hya. Accretion disk is absent, the flow is deflected by the magnetic field and subsequently falls 
alternately on the magnetic poles. 

Moment of force, leading to the observed acceleration is equal to dJ/dt=Id/dt. 

One can estimate the angular momentum using the approximating formula 

I=(4.095-2.795M-3.207.exp(-2.455M) ).1050 g.cm2 

[40], where M is the mass of the white dwarf in the solar masses.  The mass estimate M=0.42 M 
[41] corresponds to I=1.777.1050 g.cm2 and dJ/dt=1.87.1033 g.cm2/s. Estimate of the accretion rate is 
dM/dt=1.36.1015  g/s,  assuming  the  evolution  of  the  binary  due  to  gravitational  radiation  [33]. 
Estimate  of the corresponding radius of the  capture of the accretion flow  Rc=3.4.1010  cm  exceeds 
the  value  of  the  distance  between  the  components  of  a=3.0.1010сm.  Thus,  it  is  necessary  to

corresponding parameters I=1.426.1050 g.cm2, dJ/dt=1.50.1033 g.cm2/s, Rc=1.16.1010см=0.318a. It is 
close  to  the  radius  of  the  Roche  lobe  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the  line  of  centers  for  the 
given  values  of  the  mass  ratio.  Thus,  the  obtained  value  of  the  acceleration  of  the  rotation  of  the 
white dwarf is in a better agreement with parameters [42] than [41].

The  O-C  diagram  based  on  decades  of  observations  is  well  described  by  the  quadratic 
parabola, and there are no grounds to assume that the acceleration rate of rotation of the white dwarf 
is slowing, and the possibility of cyclic fluctuations. In the absence of acceleration deceleration, the 
more likely suggestion is that the rotation period of the white dwarf will decrease significantly to 
the «main group» at the diagram “Pspin-Porb in the wide area of Pspin~0.1Porb [1]. Norton et al. [33] 
separated the group of stars of EX Hya type, as that corresponding to a weak magnetic field of the 
secondary star, which fills its Roche lobe. 

To  choose  between  these  models,  it  is  necessary  to  continue  regular  observations  of  EX 

Hya.
