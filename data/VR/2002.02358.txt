A comparison of mobile VR display running on 
an ordinary smartphone with standard PC 
display for P300-BCI stimulus presentation 

G. Cattan, A. Andreev, C. Mendoza and M. Congedo 

Abstract—  A  brain-computer 

interface  (BCI)  based  on 
electroencephalography  (EEG)  is  a  promising  technology  for 
enhancing  virtual  reality  (VR)  applications—in  particular,  for 
gaming. We focus on the so-called P300-BCI, a stable and accurate 
BCI  paradigm  relying  on  the  recognition  of  a  positive  event-
related potential (ERP) occurring in the EEG about 300 ms post-
stimulation.  We  implemented  a  basic  version  of  such  a  BCI 
displayed on an ordinary and affordable smartphone-based head-
mounted VR device: that is, a mobile and passive VR system (with 
no  electronic  components  beyond  the  smartphone).  The  mobile 
phone performed the stimuli presentation, EEG synchronization 
(tagging) and feedback display. We compared the ERPs and the 
accuracy  of  the  BCI  on  the  VR  device  with  a  traditional  BCI 
running  on  a  personal  computer  (PC).  We  also  evaluated  the 
impact  of  subjective  factors  on  the  accuracy.  The  study  was 
within-subjects,  with  21  participants  and  one  session  in  each 
modality.  No  significant  difference  in  BCI  accuracy  was  found 
between  the  PC  and  VR  systems,  although  the  P200  ERP  was 
significantly wider and larger in the VR system as compared to the 
PC system.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Examining  science fiction and fantasy  literature, it appears 
that people enjoy stories in which characters “enter” physically 
into  another  world.  The  NeverEnding  Story  (Wolfgang 
Peterson, 1984, Germany/USA), Jumanji (Chris Van Allsburg, 
1981, USA), Tron (Steven Lisberger, 1982, USA), Narnia (C.S. 
Lewis,  1950-1956,  UK)  and  His  Dark  Materials  (Philip 
Pullman,  1995,  UK)  are  just  a  few  examples  where  the 
protagonist  enters  another  world  or  embodies  a  fictional 
character.  In  Jumanji,  for  instance,  the  characters  become 
pawns in a board game, and in Narnia, children enter a parallel 
hidden world through a wardrobe, suddenly becoming warriors 
and  princesses.  This  embodiment  fantasy,  which  has  been 
interpreted as a desire to escape reality by the personification of 
someone else [1], [2], partially explains the widespread interest 
in virtual reality (VR) technology. In fact, VR provides a means 
to enhance the immersion, thus reducing the distance between 
the user and the avatar who enters another world. Taking this a 
step  further,  incorporating  brain–computer  interface  (BCI) 
technology into VR is potentially a promising step to improve 
the feeling of immersion. The present work contributes to the 
fusion of VR and BCI technology by implementing and testing 
a  BCI  displayed  on  VR  devices  running  on  ordinary 
smartphones—that is, a potentially ubiquitous VR technology, 
enabling the widespread diffusion of such technology.  

A BCI is an interface that allows for direct communication 
between the brain and an electronic device, bypassing the usual 
muscular and peripheral nerve pathways [3]. Research on BCIs 
started  in  the  early  1970s  with  the  work  of  Vidal  and 
collaborators [4], who designed an interface to control a cursor 
on a computer screen using only electroencephalography (EEG) 
signals  [5].  Further  research  has  strived  to  adapt  BCI 
technology for people suffering from severe motor disabilities 
[6]–[8].  More  recent  is  the  incept  of  BCI  technology  for  the 
general  public  (e.g.,  [9]).  These  applications  face  several 
limitations:  cumbersomeness,  cost  of  EEG  hardware,  lack  of 
reactivity of the system (low accuracy and/or low bit rate) and 
the need for calibration before each BCI usage [10]. 

For  several  reasons,  electroencephalography  (EEG)  is  the 
most suitable BCI modality to be used for the general public: it 
is  noninvasive,  transportable  and  inexpensive.  Traditionally, 
BCI applications relying on EEG use three different paradigms: 
namely,  steady-state-visually-evoked  potentials 
(SSVEP), 
P300 event-related  potential  (ERP) and  mental  imagery  (MI). 
SSVEP and P300 require sensorial stimulation of the user. They 
are named synchronous protocols because the interface decides 
when to send the stimulation, hence when the user can emit a 
command.  By  contrast,  MI  is  defined  as  asynchronous,  since 
the  user  may  decide  when  to  give  a  command  by  a  mental 
imagery task such as movement imagination [3]. In the present 
study,  we  focus  on  P300-based  BCIs.  The  P300  is  an  ERP 
produced by the brain about 300 ms after the presentation of a 
stimulus. We chose the P300 because this paradigm has a higher 
bit rate than MI while being less visually fatiguing than SSVEP. 
It  can  also  allow  the  selection  of  items  from  among  a  large 
number  of  options,  whereas  SSVEP  and  MI  are  practically 
limited to allowing selection among just a few items [11], [12]. 
Moreover, [13], [14] have reported an adaptive P300 BCI that 
does not require calibration. This makes BCI technology more 
suitable  for  the  general  public,  since  avoiding  the  need  for 
calibration  is  a  key  feature  in  providing  a  plug-and-play 
technology 
the 
encumbrance and cost of EEG hardware, the readiness of BCI 
technology is a matter of time, since both the bulkiness and the 
cost are currently being rapidly reduced (e.g., OpenBCI, New 
York, US). 

the  other  main  bottleneck, 

[15].  For 

For VR, we focus on head-mounted displays (HMDs, Figure 
1). The HMD we chose consists of a smartphone plugged into 
a plastic mask placed in front of the eyes. A software plugin, 
such as Google Cardboard (Google, Mountain View, US), helps 
to  split  the  screen  of  the  smartphone  into  two  sections,  each 
section  rendering  the  virtual  scene  for  a  different  eye.  We

distinguish  passive  HMDs,  which  do  not  incorporate  any 
electromagnetic  components,  from  active  HMDs,  which  do. 
Active HMDs provide better interaction with the VR, thanks to 
the incorporated speed and proximity sensors. In fact, standard 
sensors  in  mid-range  smartphones  accumulate  an  excessive 
amount of drift, which results in substantial imprecision when 
tracking the user position and orientation.  Nevertheless, in our 
study, we chose to focus on the use of passive HMDs because 
they  are  affordable  for  the  general  public  and  adapt  to  most 
currently  available  smartphones 
(Figure  1).  To  avoid 
unnecessary recalibration during the experiment, which did not 
involve  any  physical  interactions,  we  chose  to  disable  the 
smartphone sensors.

Figure  1.  VRElegiant  (a)  and  SamsungGear  (b)  are  two  popular  HMDs. 
VRElegiant (Elegiant, Austin, US) is a passive HMD: it does not incorporate 
electronics.  The  SamsungGear  (Samsung,  Seoul,  South  Korea)  is  an  active 
HMD that works only with specific smartphones from the manufacturer.  

Several previous studies have focused on the integration of 
BCI technology with VR gaming [10], [16]–[19]. These studies 
agree  that  the  use  of  BCI  in  VR  games  may  enhance  the 
immersion  feeling.  The  business  overview  presented  in  [10] 
also  outlines  that  there  is  a  concrete  market  with  increasing 
demands  for  BCI  and  VR  technologies,  in  particular  for  the 
gaming industry. As it had not been established whether the use 
of an HMD impacts the quality of the EEG data by interfering 
with  the  signal,  in  a  previous  study  we  compared  the  power 
spectrum of the EEG recorded with and without an HMD [20]. 
Our  results  showed  that  the  quality  of  EEG  signal  is  similar 
under  the  two  conditions.  Previous  studies  [16],  [21]–[24] 
conclude  that  performance  of  a  VR  BCI  is  equal  to  or  better 
than that of a personal computer (PC) BCI. Recently, study [25] 
has shown significant improvement in BCI training when using 
a modern HMD and the motor imagery paradigm.  However, it 
is difficult to compare the results of these studies because they 
use  different  VR  devices  and  EEG  paradigms.  For  example, 
[26]  describes  a  system  consisting  of  an  HMD  with  an  eye-
tracker,  whereas  [16]  presents  an  immersive  game  with  a 
CAVE.1  Moreover,  [16],  [21],  [24],  [26],  [27]  describe  BCI 
applications based on P300; [21], [23], [25], [28] applications 
with motor imagery; and [16], [21], [29] BCI systems based on 
SSVEP. References [24], [26] are studies combining an HMD 
and the P300 paradigm, as in the present study. However, both 
these studies use expensive materials and require a standalone 
workstation, thus their systems are not suitable for popularizing 
BCI+VR technology due to their price and bulk. 

In  contrast  to  these  studies,  the  P300-based  HMD  user

projections on between three and six of the walls of a room-sized cube. 

interface we developed runs independently on the smartphone 
and  not  on  a  PC.  We  also  implement  a  robust  BCI  based  on 
Riemannian geometry, meeting the functional requirements for 
BCIs of [15]. Finally, we correct the tagging latency in VR and 
PC,  which  has  never  been  done  before,  although  it  must  be 
corrected to compare the ERPs in the two conditions. 

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 
II describes the materials and methods. Three kinds of analysis 
are presented: analysis of the EEG data, comparison of the BCI 
performance  in  VR  versus  PC  and  analysis  of  the  user 
experience through a questionnaire. The results are discussed in 
Section III. Section IV presents our conclusion.  

II.  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

A.  Participants 

A  total  of  21  volunteers  participated  in  the  experiment  (7 
females), with mean (sd) age 26.38 (5.78) and median age 26 
years.  Eighteen of the subjects were between 19 and 28 years 
old. The  three  subjects  outside  this  range  were  33,  38 and 44 
years  old.  Before  the  experiment,  each  subject  was  informed 
that he or she would be exposed to electromagnetic radiation, 
as the device contained an active smartphone placed in front of 
the eyes. We excluded from the study all participants presenting 
with  a  risk  of  epilepsy  or  reporting  previous  experience  with 
motion  sickness.  All  participants  provided  written  informed 
consent  confirming  they  were  notified  of  the  experimental 
process,  the  data  management  procedures  and  the  right  to 
withdraw  from  the  experiment  at  any  time.  The  study  was 
approved  by  the  Ethical  Committee  of  the  University  of 
Grenoble  Alpes  (Comité  d’Ethique  pour  la  Recherche  Non-
Interventionnelle).  

B.  Hardware 

A VR system for the general public should be affordable and 
lightweight  but  at  the  same  time  should  provide  high-quality 
immersion  and  graphics.  It  should  also  be  able  to  detect 
precisely the user’s head position and rotation, so as to enhance 
the immersion feeling, as well as to minimize the inter-oculus 
latency  to  improve  the  detection  of  the  P300  signal.  For  this 
study,  we  chose  a  passive  HMD  mask  manufactured  by 
VRElegiant  (Elegiant,  Austin,  US)  (Figure  1a)  and  a  Huawei 
mate  7 
(Huawei,  Shenzhen,  China)  smartphone.  The 
VRElegiant  headset  (Elegiant,  Austin,  US)  is  affordable, 
comfortable and adapts to a wide range of smartphones. At the 
time  of  this  study,  the  Huawei  mate  7  was  a  middle-range 
smartphone, affordable for the general public. It also has a large 
screen (1920 x 1080), which is a desirable property to improve 
the  immersion  feeling  in  VR.  In  addition,  it  has  a  low  inter-
oculus latency in comparison to, for example, the Samsung S6 
(Samsung, Seoul, South Korea). These considerations and the 
others  that  led  to  the  choice  of  the  VR  material  we  used  are 
detailed in a separate technical report [30].  

In the PC condition, the application was run by a mid-range 
laptop. We found that the use of a standard i5 processor from 
Intel (Santa Clara, US) with an integrated graphic chipset could

run our application without problems. Still, the laptop may use 
up  to  16  GB  of RAM,  while  RAM  use on  the  smartphone is 
restricted to 2 GB. This and other considerations are to be taken 
into account if the data acquisition and processing are deployed 
to the smartphone. The screen of the laptop was a standard LCD 
screen with a refresh rate of 60 Hz and a resolution of 1920 x 
1080 pixels. The displayed texture looked the same as that seen 
on the smartphone screen except for some momentary effects 
of pixelation in VR.  

Concerning the EEG system, research is currently ongoing to 
provide  affordable  hardware  with  low  encumbrance  without 
sacrificing  the  quality  of  the  signal.  Current  low-cost  EEG 
headsets  such  as Emotiv  (Sydney,  Australia)  provide an EEG 
signal of lower quality than that of medical or research-grade 
EEG equipment [31], [32]. For this reason, in this study EEG 
signals  were  acquired  by  means  of  a  standard  research  grade 
amplifier  (g.USBamp,  g.tec,  Schiedlberg,  Austria)  and  the 
EC20  cap  equipped  with  16  wet  electrodes  (EasyCap, 
Herrsching am Ammersee, Germany), placed according to the 
10-20 international system. The locations of the electrodes were 
FP1, FP2, FC5, FC6, FZ, T7, CZ, T8, P7, P3, PZ, P4, P8, O1, 
Oz and O2. The reference was placed on the right earlobe and 
the ground at the AFZ scalp location. The amplifier was linked 
by USB connection to the PC, where the data were acquired by 
means of the open-source software OpenVibe [33], [34]. Data 
were  acquired  with  no  digital  filter  applied  and  a  sampling 
frequency of 512 samples per second. For the ensuing analysis, 
tags  were  sent  by  the application  to the amplifier  through  the 
USB  port  of  the  PC or  smartphone.  They  were  then  recorded 
along  with  the  EEG  signal  as  a  supplementary  channel.  The 
tagging  process  was  the  same  on  PC  and  VR  with  two 
exceptions:  for  the  smartphone  (VR),  a  mini-USB  to  USB 
adapter was necessary and different serial port communication 
libraries were used for the VR and PC.2  

C.  Procedures 

For all subjects, the experiment took place in a small room 
containing the laptop, the VR headset, the smartphone and all 
the  required  hardware  materials  for  acquiring  the  EEG  data. 
Subjects sat in front of the laptop. They were instructed to avoid 
movement  and  to  keep  the  same  position  during  the  whole 
experiment.  These  instructions  were  the  same  for  all  the 
experimental  conditions.  The  two  experimental  setups  are 
depicted in Figure 2. 

To compare the use of BCI with an HMD (VR) and without 
an HMD (PC), we developed a simple P300 interface consisting 
of a six-by-six matrix of white flashing crosses. The task of the 
subjects was to focus on a red square target (Figure 3). The user 
interface  was  identical  for  the  PC  and  VR  conditions.  It  was 
implemented  within  the  Unity  engine  (Unity,  San  Francisco, 
US) before being exported to the PC and VR platforms. In this 
way, we ensured that the visual stimulations were identical in 
the two experimental conditions.

Figure  3.  User  interface  at  the  moment  when  a  group  of  six  nontarget 
symbols (crosses) are flashing (in white).  

The experiment was composed of two sessions. One session 
ran  under  the  PC  condition  and  the  other  under  the  VR 
condition.  The  order  of  the  sessions  was  randomized  for  all 
subjects. Each session comprised 12 blocks of five repetitions 
(Figure 4). A repetition consisted of 12 flashes of groups of six 
symbols  chosen  in  such  a  way  that  over  the  course  of  one 
repetition,  each  of  the  36  symbols  flashed  exactly  two  times 
[35], [36]. Thus, in each repetition, two groups of six flashing 
symbols included the target, whereas the remaining 10 flashes 
where composed of a group of six nontarget symbols. The target 
symbol was the same for all five repetitions within a block. That 
is, a target symbol flashed exactly 10 times within a block (5 
repetitions  x  2  target  flashes).  The  onset  of  each  flash  was 
tagged into the EEG stream. 

After  each  block  of  five  repetitions  with  the  same target,  a 
random feedback message was given to the subject in the form 
of the item selection. A 2s pause was allowed between the end 
of  the  repetition  and  the  release  of  the  feedback  in  order  to 
mimic  network  latency  (such  as between  the  smartphone and 
OpenVibe). The feedback was “correct” if the selected symbol 
was the target, “incorrect” otherwise. The feedback was drawn 
randomly 
from  a  uniform  distribution  with  “correct” 
representing  70%  of  results.  The  use  of  random  feedback 
ensures that the performance of a participant  does not depend 
on  the  feedback,  avoiding  confounding  effects  due  to  inter-
subject  variability—for  instance,  the  subject’s  perceived 
confidence  or  frustration  in  operating  the  BCI,  which  may 
affect his or her actual performance and concentration. At the 
end  of  the  experiment,  the  user  answered  a  questionnaire, 
reported at the end of this document.

Figure 4. The experiment for each participant was composed of two sessions 
of 12 blocks, a block consisting of five repetitions of the same target. 

A pilot experiment showed that the inertial measurement unit 
the  smartphone  sometimes  accumulated  an 
(IMU)  of 
unexpected amount of drift, causing the virtual world to slowly 
move around the subject. Therefore, the IMU was deactivated 
for  the  experiments.  As  a  consequence,  the  application  was 
always fixed in front of the subject’s eyes.  

D.  EEG data analysis 
1)  Method 

As  pre-processing,  we  applied  a  fourth-order  linear  phase 
response IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) Butterworth filter in 
the  bandpass  region  1–20  Hz.  Then  we  used  a  linear  phase 
response IIR notch filter at 50Hz with a Q factor equal to 35. 
These filters were implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, 
USA)  using  the  butter  and  iirnotch  functions  associated  with 
the  filtfilt  function,  which  implements  zero-phase  digital 
filtering. The data were then down-sampled to 128 samples per 
second.  The  ensuing  analysis  was  carried  out  using  in-house 
software and the Brainstorm software [37]. We extracted from 
the  signal  epochs  of  1s  of  EEG  data  after  each  tag.  The 
timestamps  of the  tags  were  corrected  by  taking into  account 
the  average  latency  of  the  tagging in  the two conditions.  The 
latency  of  the  tagging method  was measured for  both  the  left 
and right screens in the VR condition. We kept the smaller of 
these two measures, as it corresponded to the first appearance 
of the stimulus on the screen [38]. All ERP epochs were shifted 
with respect to the tag according to the latency estimation. The 
estimated latencies (sd) for PC and VR were 38.1 (5.3) ms and 
117.23 (5.81) ms, respectively. There were a total of 120 target 
epochs (12 blocks x 5 repetitions x 2 flashes) and 600 nontarget 
epochs (12 blocks x 5 repetitions x 10 flashes) per subject for 
each experimental condition. Each set of 120 target epochs and 
600 nontarget epochs were arithmetically averaged.  Then, we 
computed for each subject the difference between the average 
ERPs  for  target  and  nontarget  epochs.  These  42  average 
differences of ERPs (21 subjects, two conditions) were entered 
into  a  paired,  two-sided,  cluster-based  permutation  test  [39] 
comparing  the  VR  versus  the  PC condition  (Figure 5).  In  our 
case,  clusters  were  constituted  on  the  basis  of  the  temporal 
(EEG samples from 0 to 1 s post-stimulus) and spatial (all scalp 
electrodes) adjacency of the effect. The cluster-based approach 
allows  circumventing  of  the  multiple  comparison  problem—
i.e., it ensures that the type I error rate is below the predefined 
alpha level, which in this study we set to the typical 0.05 level. 
The  test  was  run  using  the  ft_timelockstatistics  routine  in 
Fieldtrip [40], [41] (included in Brainstorm). In this routine, the 
cluster  alpha  threshold  was  set  to  0.025.  An  approximate  p-
value was obtained by means of 5,000 random permutations.

nontarget, respectively.  

2)  Results 
In  both  conditions,  ERPs  of  interest are  found  between  about 
100 ms and 700 ms (Figure 6). The cluster-based test revealed 
significant differences between the two conditions in the 148–
313-ms range in the central, frontal, left temporal, parietal and 
occipital  locations  (differences  were  not  significant  only  for 
electrodes  FP1,  FP2,  FC6  and  T8).  This  time  interval 
corresponds to the P200, which is statistically wider and larger 
in VR as compared to PC.

of the signal at the CZ, PZ and OZ electrodes (thick lines). The colored areas in 
orange and green display the ±1standard error areas of the nontarget and target 
ERP, respectively. At top are the scalp topographies of the grand average of the 
amplitude of the target minus nontarget epochs, averaged from 10 ms before to 
10 ms after each peak. The two vertical lines enclose the time period where the 
permutation test detected a significant difference between the PC and the VR 
conditions.  The  electrodes  marked  by  black  disks  comprise  the  significant 
cluster. 

Qualitative but not significant differences also appear in the 
shape,  amplitude  and  latency  of  the  other  ERP  components, 
which  however  all  have  similar  topographies  in  the  two 
conditions:  
-  The peak of the early negative visual potential (N100) with 
occipital topographic dominance appears ~15 ms later and with 
lower amplitude in the PC condition as compared to VR.

-  The P300 peak occurs with maximal amplitude at around 380 
ms  in  the  PC  condition  and  at  around  400  ms  in  the  VR 
condition,  in  both cases  with  central and  occipital  dominance 
but with lower amplitude in the VR condition.  
-  A late negativity (probably an N700) with frontal and central 
dominance appears with maximal amplitude at around 540 ms 
in  both  PC  and  VR,  with  a  higher  amplitude  in  PC.  The 
negativity begins earlier in PC (480 ms vs 500 ms in VR) but 
perdures longer in VR (~200 ms in PC vs 280 ms in VR).  

While  we  show  here  only  the  traces  at  representative 
electrodes CZ, PZ and OZ, the same peaks are identifiable in 
most of the electrodes. 

E.  Comparison of BCI performance 
1)  Method 

In this section, we test the performance of an offline classifier 
in the two experimental conditions. We extracted epochs of 600 
ms after each tag. We applied a simplified version of the spatial 
filtering described in [42] to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio. 
In summary, let us denote TA the set of size K containing all the 
targets  epochs  and  NT  the  set  of  size  L  containing  all  the 
nontarget  epochs.  We  compute C, the mean  of the  covariance 
matrices of all epochs, as 

𝐶 = 1
𝐾+𝐿

∑

𝑋 𝜖 ( 𝑇𝐴 ⋃ 𝑁𝑇)

𝑋𝑋𝑇

and compute 𝐶𝑇𝐴, the covariance matrix of the evoked potential 
of the target epochs, as 

𝐶𝑇𝐴 =   𝑋̅𝑇𝐴𝑋̅

𝑇 ,    where    𝑋̅𝑇𝐴 = 1

𝑇𝐴

𝐾

∑

𝑋 𝜖 𝑇𝐴 . 
𝑋

We then compute the generalized eigenvalue decomposition of 
C and 𝐶𝑇𝐴 as 

𝑈𝐶𝑈𝑡 =   𝐼𝑛  and 𝑈 𝐶𝑇𝐴 𝑈𝑡 =  𝛬, 

where U  is an invertible matrix, and Λ is diagonal and holds the 
generalized eigenvalues. Notice that the elements of Λ are also 
the  eigenvalues  of  𝐶 −1𝐶𝑇𝐴.  Spatial  filtering 
implies  a 
dimensionality reduction. To define the subspace, we take the 
four  generalized  eigenvectors  of  𝑈  corresponding  to  the  four 
largest eigenvalues in Λ. These eigenvectors correspond to the 
components  that  maximize  the  ratio  between  𝐶𝑇𝐴  and  C  and 
thus are the most discriminative. 

For cross-validation purposes, the 12 blocks were separated 
into  training  and  testing  sets.  To  determinate  the  optimum 
number  of  blocks  for  training,  the  performance  values  of  the 
classifier  were  assessed  for  different  training  sizes,  ranging 
from 10% to 90% of the total number of blocks in steps of 10%. 
For each training set and condition (PC or VR), we randomly 
selected epochs from the training blocks to build a Riemannian 
minimum-distance-to-mean (RMDM) classifier [15], [43] and 
used  the  remaining  blocks  for  testing.  We  implemented  the 
RMDM algorithm using the log-determinant distance and mean 
[44].  
For  each  training  set,  we  tested  the  RMDM  classifier  for 
different numbers of repetitions, from one to five, for each test 
block.  When  using  more  than  one  repetition,  we  averaged 
together  the  epochs  obtained  in  each  repetition  in  the  two 
flashing  conditions  (target  and  nontarget).  The  performance 

was assessed using three metrics. The first metric is the hit rate 
(HR),  which  is  the  proportion  of  time  the  target  is  correctly 
identified  by the  classifier.  Metric  HR  is interesting  from  the 
user perspective, since it naturally reflects the performance of 
the user according to the task. HR is also useful to compute the 
information transfer rate (ITR), which is a standard measure to 
evaluate the responsiveness of a BCI [3] in bit/min. It is defined

, where N is the number of

(BA),  which  is  defined  by

(

(respectively C and  D)  stand for the  number  of  correctly and 
incorrectly classified flashes of nontarget (resp. target) groups. 
In comparison to the HR, the BA takes into account also the rate 
of correctly classified nontarget symbols. The third metric is the 
area  under  the  receive  operating  characteristic  curve  (ROC-
AUC), which is a standard measure to evaluate the performance 
of  a  classifier  for  unbalanced  classes,  although  the  resulting 
score  is less intuitive.  Unlike  the  HR metric,  but like the  BA 
metric, ROC-AUC is a flash-based metric and not a repetition-
based metric. The area under the curve (AUC) of each metric 
was computed to provide a unique index of the performance of 
each  training  set.  Metrics  were  averaged  over  100  randomly 
chosen sets (Figure 7). As shown in Figure 8, the AUC of the 
classifier displays a logarithmic profile with a plateau starting 
at about 40 epochs. Since the AUC does not improve much after 
40 epochs, we kept this figure for training size. This implies that 
the  optimum  size  of  the  training  set  is  around  30%  (40/120 
epochs)  of  the  total  number  of  blocks,  independently  of  the 
experimental  condition.  We  conclude  that  the  VR  condition 
requires  the  same  amount  of  data  for  training  as  the  PC 
condition.

performance. 

The difference in the mean classification accuracy between 
the two conditions  as a  function  of the number of  repetitions 
(one to five) was evaluated using the BA metric by means of a 
two-way within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) where 
the first factor was the experimental condition and  the second 
factor was the number of repetitions. Only one metric (BA) was 
used to keep a reasonable level for the type I errors (fixed to α 
= 0.05). The  ANOVA  tests  were  conducted  with  and  without 
the three outsiders (i.e., the three subjects older than 28 years). 
There  was  no  difference  in  the  analysis  with  and  without 
outsiders, thus we present the results obtained with all subjects.

The ANOVA revealed no difference in classification accuracy 
obtained in the two experimental conditions. There was a main 
effect  on the  repetition factor  (p <  0.001). This  effect is  well 
expected, since averaging evoked potentials across repetitions 
increases

classification accuracy (Figure 9).

F.  Analysis of the questionnaire 
1)  Method 
At the end of the experimental session, the subjects answered a 
questionnaire, reported at the end of this document. From the 
questionnaire,  we  extracted  four  variables  (Table  2):  gender 
(Male or Female), amount of previous experience in VR (none, 
occasional  or  repetitive  experience),  sensation  of  discomfort 
and sensation of control preference (SCP). SCP is a subjective 
index taking one of two possible values depending on whether 
the  sensation  of  control  is  greater  in  VR  or  in  PC.  The 
differences between the means observed in the levels of these 
four variables were assessed by means of four two-way mixed-
model ANOVAs, where the above variables were the between-
subject factor and the experimental condition (PC or VR) was 
the within-subject factor. Using the method of Bonferroni, we 
adjusted the p-values threshold to α = 0.0125 (i.e., 0.05/4). 

Additionally, we tested whether a better sensation of control 
in VR (PC) was correlated to a preference for VR  (PC) using 
the phi coefficient [45], which measures the association of two 
binary variables (here the SCP and the preference for VR or PC, 
which was one if the subject preferred VR and zero otherwise). 
2)  Results 

Descriptive statistics of interest are as follows: 

-  66.67% (2.16) of the subjects preferred the VR condition. 
-  61.90% (2.23) of the subjects had a better or equal sensation 
of control under the VR condition as compared to PC. 
-  The experiment resulted in fatigue for 52.38% (2.29) of the 
subjects.  This  is  consistent  with  previous  studies  reporting  a 
high mental load with the visual P300 (e.g., [46] ). This outlines 
the need for smart design when using BCI with VR [10]. 
-  The  mean  (sd)  sensation  of  control  values  for  VR  and  PC 
were 6.48 (2.73) and 6.33 (2.58) on a 10-point scale which is in 
line with the probability of receiving correct feedback (70%).  
-  28.57%  (2.07)  of  the  subjects  reported  a  sensation  of 
discomfort  due  to  a  heavy  HMD,  the  effort  of  concentration, 
visual fatigue, a problem setting up the HMD or the flashing of 
stimuli groups distracting them from the target. These problems 
were also reported by subjects who did not report a sensation of 
discomfort.  

Note  that  for  binary  variables,  the  standard  deviations 
indicated within the brackets were computed using a binomial 
law. Participants also provided general remarks, summarized as 
follows: 
-  Include  the  correction  of  their  vision  in  the  HMD.  Also, 
setting the stereo convergence takes time for many subjects. 
-  Add feedback for error quantification. Indeed, it was reported 
that when the result was  incorrect, there was no indication on 
how close the participant has come to being correct, making it 
difficult to improve performance.

epochs used for training. The vertical lines are the standard errors: that is, the 
standard deviations divided by the square root of the number of subjects.  

2)  Results 
In Figure 9, the HR for PC (VR) is in the range 0.57–0.94 (0.52–
0.91)  depending  on  the  number  of  repetitions.  Although 
maximum  accuracy  selection  was  obtained  with 
five 
repetitions,  the  ITR  is  maximal  with  one  repetition,  as  the 
required time to select a symbol increases as a function of the 
repetition number. The highest ITR was 20.1 bit/min for PC and 
17.31 bit/min for VR.

-  Some  participants  reported  that  the  low  performance  was 
expected  because  of  their lack  of  focus.  Others  said  that  they 
found tricks to improve their accuracy by concentrating harder 
on  the  target,  viewing  all  the  crosses  in  the  periphery  or 
counting the flashes in their head.  

None of the ANOVA test results were significant. However 
we mention that the type II error rate for these tests, which we 
estimated using the g*power software [47], [48] that follows the 
method of Cohen [49], was rather high.  

The result from the phi-test showed a significant correlation 
(phi-coefficient  =  0.67,  n  =  14,  p  <  0.05)  between  a  higher 
sensation  of  control  for  a  condition  and  a  preference  for  that 
condition. This held for both conditions (phi-coefficient = 0.48, 
n = 7, p < 0.05). 

To  summarize,  effects  of  discomfort  were  reported  by 
participants whether or not they answered yes to the sensation 
of  discomfort  question  on  the  questionnaire,  suggesting  that 
there  is  no  link  between  these  remarks  and  the  sensation  of 
discomfort.  Results  from  the  questionnaire  also  suggest  four 
general remarks. First, people tried to explain their performance 
even  though  they  had  no  control  over  their  performance. 
Second,  the  sensation  of  control  was  in  line  with  the  given 
feedback.  Third,  the  sensation  of  control  was  higher  in  the 
preferred  experimental  condition.  Fourth,  the  majority  of 
subjects preferred the BCI running in VR.  

III.  DISCUSSION 

The P200 component of the ERP was significantly different 
in  the  VR  and  PC  conditions.  The  P200  is  part  of  the  long 
latency response, occurring after sensory responses and before 
high-level cognitive tasks such as the P300 [50]. It is involved 
in the cognitive process comparing sensory inputs with memory 
[51]  and  is  modulated  by  arousal,  attention  [50],  depth 
perception [52] or the intensity of the stimuli (see [24]).  

We  also  found  that  the  N100  component  was  more 
pronounced in VR than in PC, although this difference was not 
statistically significant. Since the N100 component is produced 
by  the two  parts  of the  brain  according  to  the location of  the 
stimulus,  the  effect  of  VR  stereoscopy  on  the  N100  was 
expected and already documented in [53].  

A  late  negativity appears  in  both  conditions. It may  be the 
N700,  an  ERP  component  involved  in  the  cognitive  task  of 
determining  concreteness  [54]–[56],  and  may  be  due  to  the 
geometry of the symbols we used (square, cross). 

The  P300  component  was  very  similar  in  the  PC  and  VR 
conditions.  Results 
studies  comparing 
from  previous 
stereoscopic vision with normal vision do not agree. In [57], the 
authors found that stereoscopy elicits higher but delayed P300, 
whereas [58] did not find any significant differences between 
the two  conditions. The two studies used a polarized monitor, 
but with a different refresh rate (60 and 240 frames-per-second 
in the first and second studies, respectively). The duration of the 
stimuli  as  well  as  the  inter-stimuli  interval  were  also 
considerably  longer  in  [58]  (respectively,  500  and  500  ms 
versus 100 and 30 ms).  

This  comparison  of  the  ERPs  in  PC  and  VR  has  been 
empowered  by  the  correction  of  the  timestamps  of  the  tags 

using the average latency of the tagging in the two conditions. 
Surprisingly, it exists a noticeable difference between these two 
latencies (38.1 ms in PC vs 117.23 ms in VR). As we explained 
in  [38],  this  difference  is  caused  by  hardware  and  software 
implementations,  whereas  in  general  is  not  related  to  the 
subject’s capability – except for people having an uncommon 
perception  of  the  display  image  rate  such  as,  for  instance, 
hardcore gamers or pilots. In [30] we exposed the methodology 
for computing these latencies. 

The variations in ERP amplitude we found are likely due to 
the different size and luminosity of the stimuli in VR and PC. 
They can also be explained by the latency between the two parts 
of  the  screen  in  VR,  as  a  high  latency  between  the  screens 
causes the stimulus to remain displayed longer. However, the 
effect of the duration of the stimulus on the ERP amplitude and 
classification may not be meaningful [59]. To our knowledge, 
no  previous  article  has  compared  stereoscopic  and  normal 
vision  with  an  HMD  while  correcting  appropriately  for  the 
latency, therefore our findings may be considered new. 

The AUC of our classifier ranges between 0.9 and 1.0, which 
is almost  the  same as the  AUC  reported in  [31].  In  spite of  a 
higher  ERP  amplitude  in  VR,  there  were  not  significant 
differences in classification accuracy between the VR and PC 
conditions, which may be explained by the fact that the P200 
component  is  stronger  but  also  more  variable  in  the  VR 
condition (Figure  6). This  result is consistent  with a  previous 
study on HMDs [24].  

We chose to disable the IMU to avoid the drift. The IMU is 
part  of  the  immersion  process  in  VR.  Thus  by  disabling  it, 
admittedly we did not make use of the main capabilities of the 
VR  system,  which  are  to  move  in  and  watch  in  a  3D 
environment.  For  instance,  we  may  expect  that  the  3D 
immersion  has a  higher impact on the  sensation  of control in 
VR, thus resulting in a significant effect on performance in VR. 
However,  our  objective  was  to  assess  whether  the  same  BCI 
task  performed  on  a  PC  may  also  be  achieved  in  VR  using 
inexpensive equipment, which to the best of our knowledge has 
never been  done  before. The present  study answers  this  basic 
requirement,  providing  a  first  point  of  comparison  for  further 
studies willing to develop options for BCI+VR technology for 
the general public. 

In  this  study  we  also  chose  to  concentrate  on  hardware 
tagging through the USB port because it had already been tested 
in [35]. However, by synchronizing clocks in the HMD and the 
acquisition  system,  it  would  be  possible  to  communicate 
without  a  cable.  This  method  is  enabled  in  the  OpenVibe 
platform [60] and could be used in building a mobile HMD with 
a  P300-based  BCI.  Indeed,  the  development  of  inside-out 
technology  allows  the  use  of  mobile  HMDs.  However,  the 
possibility to classify P300s when the subject is moving is still 
a subject of research [61]–[63]. The use of mixed interfaces, by 
taking  into  account  eye  blinks  [64]  or  auditory  stimuli  [46], 
[65],  for  example,  is  another  option  to  circumvent  these 
limitations.  In  particular,  the  gyroscope  and  accelerometer 
integrated in the smartphone may participate in the recognition 
of the user’s intention, or at least in the detection of artifacts. 

This  led  us  to  the  main  limitation  of  the  system  we

implemented, which is due to movement. While movement is a 
basic  input  for  VR,  it  interferes  with  the  acquisition  of  EEG 
signals.  At  the  same  time,  popular  VR  applications  such  as 
action  games  require  speed  and  accuracy,  which  are 
incompatible with the use of BCIs. Some of these aspects have 
been studied further in a previous publication [10]. There, we 
suggested restricting BCI to a few elements of the application. 
In general, applications with a slow gameplay are suitable, such 
as turn-based simulation or adventure games.

In  this  same  vein,  the  analysis  of  the  responses  to  the 
questionnaire highlights the impact of subjective factors on the 
user  experience.  In  particular,  we  found  that  the  subject’s 
sensation of control is higher in his or her preferred condition 
(PC or VR) and that the sensation of control is in line with the

Taken together, the last remarks are interesting for designing 
gaming  applications,  suggesting  that  the  design  of  the 
application is more important for gaming than the accuracy of 
the BCI itself. This conclusion was drawn in [18], [66], where 
it  was  suggested that  unreliable input can  be  used  to  develop 
fun  games.  Reference  [18]  integrates  a  BCI  control  into  a 
popular role-play fantasy game. The authors found that in spite 
of  weak  control  and  involvement  using  such  BCI—in 
particular,  the  accuracy  was  around  75%—the  experience  of 
fun was similar with and without BCI control. Although highly 
unreliable controls often result in frustration, it was also shown 
that players had less fun while experiencing a game with perfect 
control [66].

The  questions  asked  of  participants  in  the  questionnaire  are 
presented  in  Table  1.  In  the  analysis,  we  used  the  factors 
presented in Table 2. As an inclusion criterion, we submitted to 
statistical  analysis  only  the  factors  containing  at  least  six 
participants for each level. When the question was open, such 
as “How many hours a week do you play first-person shooters?” 
the levels were created by the authors. In some cases, there were 
not enough participants to fulfill our criterion, as was the case 
for questions 1, 2, 8 and 9 (see Table 1).

IV.  CONCLUSION 

Table 1. Questionnaire 

The  introduction  of  VR+BCI  technology  has  not  been 
investigated using affordable materials such as a passive HMD 
running on an ordinary smartphone. Yet, the price of high-end 
VR  materials  is  an  obstacle  to  the  popularization  of  a  mixed 
technology VR+BCI. This study evaluated the performance of 
a BCI  displayed  on  an  ordinary  VR  device  (a  smartphone) in 
comparison  to a  BCI  displayed  on a  PC,  while also assessing 
the 
several  user  experience  factors.  We  showed 
performance of a P300-based BCI coupled with a passive HMD 
is  comparable  to  the  performance  of  a  state-of-the-art  BCI 
displayed  on  a  PC.  In  other  words,  proper  ERPs  are  elicited 
using such an HMD, and the average classification accuracy is 
adequate.  These  results  extend  those  of  [24],  which  were 
gathered  using  the  same  kind  of  BCI  but  displayed  on  an 
expensive  HMD.  The  data  from  the  present  study  are  freely
