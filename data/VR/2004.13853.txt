Abstract 
The aim of this project is the development of a Virtual Reality Appli-
cation in order to document one kind of Balinese cultural heritage 
which are Temples. The Bali Temple VR application will allow users 
to do a virtual tour and experience the landscape of the temples and 
all objects inside the temples. The application provides an on-site 
tour guide using virtual reality that allows users to experience the 
visualization of the Balinese cultural heritage, which in this case are 
temples. The users can walk through the temples and can see the 3D 
objects of temples and also there is narration of every object inside 
the  temples  with  background  music.  Right  now,  the  project  has 
completed two temples for the virtual reality tour guide application. 
Those  temples  are  Melanting Temples  and  Pulaki Temples.  Based 
on the test results of its functional requirements, this virtual reality 
application has been able to run well as expected. All features that 
have been developed have been running well. Based on 20 respon-
dents  with  various  ages  and  backgrounds,  our  finding  shows  that 
The  Bali Temple VR Application  attracts  people  of  all  ages  to  use 
and experience it. They are eager to use it and hope that there will 
be more temples that they can experience to visit in this application.

Introduction

Bali is the smallest island and province of Indonesia. Bali, with its varied 
landscape of hills and mountains, rugged coastlines and sandy beaches, 
lush rice terraces and barren volcanic hillsides, all providing a picturesque 
backdrop  to  its  colourful,  deeply  spiritual  and  unique  culture,  stakes  a 
serious claim to be paradise on earth. Bali, the famed Island of the Gods 
has  many  cultural  heritages,  one  of  them  are  temples.  Bali  is  known  as 
an island of thousands temples. In every village in Bali, there are several 
temples  and  at  least  one  small  temple  in  each  home  of  Balinese  which 
reach to a total of 10.000. Balinese name of temple is pura. A pura is a 
Balinese Hindu temple and the place of worship for the adherents of Bali-
nese Hinduism in Indonesia. Puras are built in accordance to rules, style, 
guidance and rituals found in Balinese architecture. Most of the puras are 
found on the island of Bali, as Hinduism is the predominant religion on 
it, however many puras exist in other parts of Indonesia where there are 
significant numbers of Balinese people. Puras are part of cultural heritages 
in Bali.
Cultural  heritage  is  a  cultural  property  that  has  an  important  value  for 
understanding  and  developing  history,  science  and  culture  in  the  frame-
work  of  fostering  the  community  and  nation‘s  personality  [ThSR13]. 
Preservation  of  cultural  heritage  must  continue  to  be  carried  out  to 
preserve the culture that we have. Cultural heritage and natural resources 
are  increasingly  threatened  by  damage,  not  only  by  traditional  causes, 
but because social change and socio-economic conditions are worsening 
the  situation  and  as  a  great  phenomenon  of  damage  or  destruction  and 
awareness generally always comes too late for a cultural heritage, it‘s very 
important we take care. 
Being located on the Pacific Ring of Fire (an area with a lot of tectonic acti-
vity), Indonesia has to cope with the constant risk of volcanic eruptions, 
earthquakes,  floods  and  tsunamis.  On  several  occasions  during  the  last 
15 years, Indonesia has made global headlines due to devastating natural 
disasters  that  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  human 
and animal lives, plus having a destructive effect on the land area (inclu-
ding infrastructure, and thus resulting in economic costs). The fact that Bali 
is part of Indonesia which is situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the efforts

to prevent damage to cultural heritages need to be proactively managed 
by  means  of  preservation  of  cultural  heritages.  One  way  to  preserve  the 
cultural  heritage  which  in  this  case  are  temples  is  to  use  virtual  reality 
technology. One of the main advantages, in the fields of virtual realities is 
the complete virtual reconstruction of 3D environments, especially buil-
dings in full detail. Even if the cultural heritage is physically damaged, it 
can be virtually reconstructed through probabilistic approximations.
This  paper  presents  the  project  for  the  development  of  a  virtual  reality 
based  application  for  the  documenting  the  Balinese  temples  in  Bali, 
Indonesia. By having such a kind of model, we can reconstruct the buil-
dings  based  on  the  data  that  have  been  developed  in  the  virtual  reality 
application if, for example, things unexpected happen in the future. The 
Bali Temple VR application will allow users to do the virtual tour and expe-
rience the landscape of the temples and all objects inside the temples.

 State of Arts: Laboratory of Cultural Informatics Augmented and Virtual 
Reality Projects.
This  laboratory  focuses  on  research  related  to  culture.  One  focus  of 
research at this laboratory is the use of augmented technology and virtual 
reality  to  document  the  culture,  cultural  heritage,  arts,  folklore  in  Bali. 
Augmented  and  virtual  reality  technology  development  began  in  2013. 
We  first  developed  an  augmented  reality  book  containing  Balinese 
cultural  heritage  such  as  temples,  dances,  musical  instruments,  buil-
ding  ornaments,  and  others  [DKCW14][KDCA14]. The  working  concept 
of  augmented  reality  is  that  the  application  will  detect  images  in  books 
that will then bring up immovable objects. Then in 2015, we developed 
an augmented reality book containing legend and Balinese folklore. The 
object in the application is an animation of every Balinese folklore scene 
[DSKA15].  The  augmented  reality  project  continues  with  applications 
without books. The feature used in the application to get a marker is to use 
a  user-defined  target,  where  the  user  uses  images  that  are  nearby  which 
are then made into markers so that they can display animations from each 
scene [WiDS17]. The development of culture-based virtual reality at LCI 
began in 2018. The first virtual reality application developed were games 
for Balinese folklores [KhAP18]. Then, it was continued with the develop-
ment of virtual reality applications for temples in Bali that had previously 

32

been developed using augmented reality on the augmented reality book 
project.  The  latest  development  of  virtual  reality  application  for  Bali-
nese temples is the development of a 3D 360° Virtual Reality Video Pura 
Besakih prototype [CrPW17].

2.1  Analysis and Design 
Functional Requirements Analysis
After  gathering  and  analyzing  needs,  there  are  some  functional  require-
ments that are used as a basis for designing Bali Temple VR applications, 
which are:

a.  The application facilitates users to be able to take a tour in the 

temple area.

b.  Applications can display temple objects and their landscapes in 

three dimensions.

33

c.  The application can provide information in the form of audio and 

text about objects in the temples.

Tools and Materials
Based on the needs analysis carried out, the software that is needed for the 
development of virtual reality applications is:

•  Blender is used to create Pulaki Temple objects
•  Photoshop is used to edit temple object textures
•  Unity3D  with  StemVR  Library  is  used  to  create  the  virtual  reality 

application

•  Adobe Premiere is used to edit audio for temple object explanations.
The hardware that was used for the development and implementation of 
this application is:

•  PCs for developing and implementing the application.
•  HTC Vive

2.2  The Development Steps of Bali Temple VR Application
The  steps  in  developing  the  Bali Temple VR  consist  of  three  main  steps. 
First,  taking  real  images  of  temples  including  the  objects  inside  the 
temples by using a drone and perspective calculation in order to get the 
exact measurement. Second step is the development of 3D objects of the 
temples by using Blender. The third step is the development of VR appli-
cation by using Unity3D and the library Stem VR. The VR tool that is used 
is HTC Vive.

Implementation of 3-Dimensional Objects

3.1 
The  first  stage  in  the  development  of  the  augmented  reality  story  book 
is  the  creation  of  3D  objects  and  animations. The  tool  used  is  Blender 
version  2.70.  The  development  of  3D  objects  and  animation  involves 
several steps: 

a.  Modeling. This is the process of creating 3D mesh (characters and 
other 3D objects) using some mesh tools such as plane, cube, 
circle, uv sphere, icosphere, cylinder, cond, grid, and torus. The 
techniques that were used were extrude technique and mirror 
modification. 

b.  Materials & Texturing. This process is used to simulate a surface 
color or property of 3D mesh. This is based on a photorealistic 
interpretation of a real material or any materials that can produce 
similar surface colors and textures.

c.  After the objects and the landscapes are done they are exported to 

Unity3D.

Implementation of Virtual Reality Application

3.2 
The  development  of  the  virtual  reality  application  uses  Unity3D.  Before 
working  with  Unity3D,  Steam  VR  has  to  be  installed  in  order  to  use 
the  virtual  reality  features.  Steam VR  can  be  downloaded  on  the  Unity 
website, https://assetstore.unity.com/.
The steps for creating a virtual reality application are as follows:

a.  Several files must be imported to Unity3D. The files are 3D objects 

with format (.fbx) and the texture files of the entire objects.

b.  It is necessary to create a number of scenes in Unity3D, and then 
those scenes are stored in the Asset folder. The number of scenes 
depends on the number of temples. For example, the temple area 
is divided into five parts, meaning that five scenes are made. Every 
scene on Unity3D consists of Camera Righ, Directional Light, 
Steam VR Laser Pointer and Steam VR Teleporter.

c.  To run the teleporter in Unity, a mesh collider is set on the object 

to be targeted by the teleporter. For example, in the VR application 
that was developed, the temple page was used as the teleport 
target so users could walk around the temple area by directing the 
controller to the temple page.

d.  The final step is the process of building a Virtual Reality applica-

tion. Application settings can be set in the build file menu settings. 
In this setting you can select the scene to be built and you can also 
add application icons. Then, the Virtual Reality application is ready 
to be built and run. The application results will be in the apk or exe 
format.

4  Discussion

The application gives an on-site tour using virtual reality that allows users 
experience the visualization of the Balinese cultural heritage, which in this 
case are temples. The users can walk through the temples and can see the 
3D objects of temples and also there is narration of every object inside the 
temples with background music. 
There are several tests we have done. Based on the test results of its func-
tional requirements (black box testing), this virtual reality application has 
been able to run well as expected. All features that have been developed 
have  been  running  well.  We  also  tested  the  application  with  a  content 
expert to test the accuracy of the shape of each object temple created in 
the virtual reality application. The accuracy of the objects and landscapes 
are 90%. There are several objects that need to be polished.
In  order  to  get  the  response  from  the  people,  the  application  is  placed 
in the Museum Bali. The questionnaire that is used is a User Experience 
Questionnaire  (UEQ).  UEQ  is  used  to  measure  the  user  experience  of 
interactive  products. The  scale  of  the  questionnaire  cover  both  classical 
usability  aspects  (efficiency,  perspicuity,  dependability)  and  user  expe-
rience aspects (originality, stimulation).

Conclusion

The  Bali Temple VR  Project  gives  the  opportunity  to  document  cultural 
heritage in Bali where the main goal of this project is to preserve Balinese 
cultural heritage and to prevent loss of critical information when negative 
things like natural disasters occur in the future. In addition, this applica-
tion can be used as a tool to introduce the culture of Bali to the people 
who  are  interested  to  know  more. The  Bali Temple VR  application  can 
help users to find information about Balinese temples as cultural heritage. 
This application can be used as a documentation for cultural heritage for 
the Bali Provincial Cultural Service. This application can also help to intro-
duce  Pura  on  Bali  globally.  Currently,  only  two  temples  have  been  digi-
tized in the form of virtual reality applications and there are three temples 
that  are  under  construction. This  project  is  carried  out  with  self  funding 
from researchers. Hopefully, there will be a form of funding in the future 
that can help us develop virtual reality applications for digitally massive 
cultural heritage in Bali.
