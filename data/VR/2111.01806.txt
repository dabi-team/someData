ABSTRACT

We present Hα velocity maps for the HIghMass galaxies UGC 7899, UGC 8475,
UGC 9037 and UGC 9334, obtained with the SITELLE Imaging Fourier Transform
Spectrometer on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, to search for kinematic signa-
tures of late gas accretion to explain their large atomic gas reservoirs. The maps for
UGC 7899, UGC 9037, and UGC 9334 are amenable to disc-wide radial ﬂow searches
with the DiskFit algorithm, and those for UGC 7899 and UGC 9037 are also amenable
to inner-disk kinematic analyses. We ﬁnd no evidence for outer disc radial ﬂows down
to ¯Vr ∼ 20 km s−1 in UGC 9037 and UGC 9334, but hints of such ﬂows in UGC 7899.
Conversely, we ﬁnd clear signatures of inner (r (cid:46) 5 kpc) non-circularities in UGC 7899
and UGC 9037 that can be modelled as either bisymmetric (which could be produced
by a bar) or radial ﬂows. Comparing these models to the structure implied by photo-
metric disc-bulge-bar decompositions, we favour inner radial ﬂows in UGC 7899 and
an inner bar in UGC 9037. With hints of outer disc radial ﬂows and an outer disc warp,
UGC 7899 is the best candidate for late accretion among the galaxies examined, but
additional modelling is required to disentangle potential degeneracies between these
signatures in H I and Hα velocity maps. Our search provides only weak constraints
on hot-mode accretion models that could explain the unusually high H I content of
HIghMass galaxies.

INTRODUCTION

Galaxies within halos are surrounded by large coronas of
hot gas and grow as low-metallicity gas from the corona and
circumgalactic medium accrete onto them (Fraternali 2017;
Ho et al. 2017). Star-forming galaxies at low redshift have
the highest rates of star formation at early times when their
gas reservoirs are plentiful. The star formation rate of a typ-
ical galaxy decreases as its stellar mass increases: gas within
the galaxy is consumed to form stars. For this reason, gas
fraction and stellar mass have a strong negative correlation
(Catinella et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2014). This trend is con-
sistent with a cosmic downsizing scenario whereby as time
passes, the galaxies which contribute to the bulk of star for-

mation within the universe get less and less massive (Cowie
et al. 1997; Juneau et al. 2005; Fontanot et al. 2009).

The recently completed Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA
(ALFALFA) extragalactic survey detected 34 spiral galax-
ies that are both massive in atomic hydrogen, H I,
(MH I > 1010 M(cid:12)) and that have high gas fractions
(MH I/M∗) relative to their stellar masses (Huang et al.
2014; Haynes et al. 2018). Branded HIghMass, H I fractions
in the sample range 0.24 < MH I/M∗ < 9.2, with a median
gas fraction of 1.23 (Huang et al. 2014). The combination
of both high MH I and high MH I/M∗ distinguish HIghMass
from other gas-rich samples such as the “H I Monsters” (Lee
et al. 2014) and “H I GHz” (Catinella & Cortese 2014) sam-
ples. The four HIghMass galaxies studied in this paper are
UGC 7899, UGC 8475, UGC 9037, and UGC 9334, and their
optical SDSS images are shown in Figure 1.

UGC 9334. The white bar in the lower-right corner of each panel
shows the angular scale of each image. See Table 1 for conversions
between angular and physical distance.

Two possible explanations for the overabundance of H I
in HIghMass galaxies are that they have undergone ineﬃ-
cient star formation over cosmic time, or they have recently
accreted external gas to replenish what they depleted to
form stars. In other words, they may be either ‘star-poor’
and/or ‘gas-rich’ respectively.

Some HIghMass galaxies may be rendered star-poor if
they are embedded in dark matter halos characterized by a
high spin parameter (λ) (Peebles 1971), which implies that
the galactic disc is extended and sparse (Mo et al. 1998). Pre-
vious studies suggest that the λ of some HIghMass galaxies
are higher than average when compared to other local galax-
ies, but that for others is commensurate with the gas-rich
galaxy population (Hallenbeck et al. 2016). In addition, UV,
optical broadband, and Hα imaging of HIghMass galaxies
(Huang et al. 2014) suggests that the majority have higher
current SFRs than the parent ALFALFA sample, which does
not support the high-spin hypothesis.

However, the H I morphology and kinematics of HIgh-
Mass galaxies provide hints that they may have been inac-
tive in the past. Hallenbeck et al. (2014) found evidence for
inﬂowing H I across the entire disc of UGC 9037, and Hal-
lenbeck et al. (2016) identiﬁed a potential H I disc warp at
r > 20 kpc in UGC 7899. In addition, a variety of axisym-
metric instability indicators in H I and CO (Toomre 1964;
Hunter et al. 1998; Schaye 2004; Romeo & Wiegert 2011;
Romeo & Falstad 2013) suggest moderate to strongly unsta-
ble inner discs in both UGC 7899 and UGC 9037, which may
also be consistent with a fresh gas reservoir on the verge of
forming stars. These results may suggest that both galaxies
have accreted material from external reservoirs or acquired
it in a merger event(s).

Under the late accretion scenario, HIghMass galaxies
maintain their gas richness through the accretion of low-
metallicity gas from the corona and circumgalactic medium.
This process occurs after galaxy formation and is hence re-
ferred to as late accretion, and may explain numerous phe-
nomena not exclusive to the HIghMass sample (Armillotta
et al. 2016; Fraternali 2017). Some degree of accretion must
be ongoing to maintain star formation in galaxies (Pitts &
Tayler 1989; Fraternali & Tomassetti 2012; Saintonge et al.
2013). Unfortunately, in the absence of detecting accretion
directly, we only have circumstantial evidence for its oc-
curence (Sancisi et al. 2008; Fraternali 2017).

Cosmological simulations predict that galaxies build
up their gas reservoirs through either hot-mode accretion,
where infalling gas shock heats to the halo virial temper-
ature before condensing onto the disc, or cold-mode accre-
tion, in which infalling gas at temperatures lower than virial
ﬂows directly into the galaxy (Kereˇs et al. 2005). Analytic
models of outside-in hot-mode accretion presented in Pez-
zulli & Fraternali (2016) imply that radial ﬂows for a Milky
Way like disc are small over cosmic time ((cid:46) 1 km s−1),
while cold-mode accretion is most common in low-mass sys-
tems (total baryon mass Mgal (cid:46) 1010.3 M(cid:12)) and dominant
at high redshift (z > 3). However, the unusually large gas
reservoirs of the HIghMass galaxies combined with hints of
disc-wide non-circular ﬂows in H I make them good candi-
dates in which to search for kinematic signatures of cold or
hot accreting gas.

As such, searching for non-circular ﬂows in Hα, begin-
ning with a disc-wide search for radial ﬂows, is a logical next

in Hα than in H I (Sellwood & S´anchez 2010), and because
Hα maps galaxies at higher angular resolution, especially in
the inner disc where H II regions are more abundant.

This paper presents a search for signatures of late gas
accretion in four HIghMass galaxies by characterizing non-
circular ﬂows in their Hα velocity maps. We describe obser-
vations of UGC 7899, UGC 8475, UGC 9037, and UGC 9334
with the SITELLE Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrome-
ter (IFTS) at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
in Section 2. We search the resulting Hα velocity maps for
radial and bisymmetric non-circular ﬂows using the DiskFit
algorithm (Spekkens & Sellwood 2007; Sellwood & S´anchez
2010; Sellwood & Spekkens 2015) in Section 3, and discuss
our results in context of the late accretion hypothesis in Sec-
tion 4.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

2.1 Sample selection

We select galaxies from the HIghMass sample deﬁned in
Huang et al. (2014) that are suitable for our study. Eligible
galaxies with signiﬁcant Hα emission need to have interme-
diate inclinations (45◦ ≤ i ≤ 75◦): galaxies with high incli-
nations are not amenable to searches for non-circular ﬂows,
while those with low inclinations will exhibit little Doppler
shift across the disc. In addition, the Hα emission of the
targets must fall entirely within SITELLE’s 647 − 685 nm
SN3 band (Drissen et al. 2019), which is likely if their H I-
measured systemic velocities satisfy VH I (cid:46) 13000 km s−1.
From the 10 HIghMass galaxies that ﬁt these criteria (Huang
et al. 2014), we were able to observe UGC 7899, UGC 8475,
UGC 9037 and UGC 9334.

2.2 SITELLE Observations

UGC 7899 and UGC 9037 were observed during photometric
conditions in queue observing mode with SITELLE on 2016
March 6, while UGC 8475 and UGC 9334 were observed on
2017 July 3rd and 2019 April 5th respectively. SITELLE is
an Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (IFTS), which
produces spectra for each pixel in its ﬁeld of view (Drissen
et al. 2019). The observations were conﬁgured to detect Hα
with a resolution R ∼ 1500 in the SN3 ﬁlter. The corre-
sponding number of ∆λ = 0.45 nm moveable mirror steps
and reference wavelength for each observation are given in
Table 1. The spectra contained the [N II] 6548 ˚A and 6583 ˚A
doublet, in addition to the brighter Hα line, which was ﬁt
along with Hα to extract line-of-sight velocities. Because the
N II doublet is weaker than the Hα emission line, the eﬀect
on the ﬁts is mild and we do not consider the N II maps in
this analysis (Drissen et al. 2019).

Table 1 also contains the Moon’s illumination fraction
fillum and its mean angular separation ¯θsep from the tar-
get during the observations. Distributed photon noise from
the Moon limits the sensitivity of SITELLE (Drissen et al.
2014), making dark sky conditions ideal. While this was the
case for the UGC 7899, UGC 9037, and UGC 9334 runs,
the Moon phase and position were more problematic for our
run on UGC 8475. We compensated for the higher lunar

photon noise by increasing the integration time per step on
this target. Even so, the resulting data quality is lower for
this galaxy (see Section 2.4).

2.3 Data Reduction with ORCS

ORCS is a publicly available1 analysis engine for spectral
data cubes taken by SITELLE (Martin et al. 2015). ORCS
generates velocity maps from hyperspectral cubes by ﬁtting
an emission line proﬁle (sinc or sincgauss, the convolution
of a sinc and a Gaussian) to the spectrum of each pixel in a
user-generated Region of Interest (ROI) around the galaxy
within SITELLE’s ﬁeld of view. The ﬁtting algorithm re-
quires an initial guess for the emission line velocity, which
should be no more than a FWHM from the emission line
proﬁle centroid to return a reliable ﬁt. For a sinc proﬁle,
this is equal to FWHM = 1.21∆w, where ∆w is the veloc-
ity spectrum channel width. Since our targets are massive
disc galaxies at intermediate inclinations, their spectral ex-
tents vastly exceed the FWHM of our observing set-up. For
each target we therefore scripted ORCS to perform a se-
ries of sinc-proﬁle ﬁts using diﬀerent input velocities across
an ROI encompassing the entire galaxy to create a series
of partial maps. We use the velocity-uncertainty associated
with a given pixel as a proxy for the goodness of ﬁt to each
spectrum. Reliable ﬁts have signiﬁcantly lower velocity un-
certainties than unreliable ones, and we therefore construct
a velocity ﬁeld for each target by selecting the pixel values
within the ROI with the lowest velocity uncertainty across
all partial maps. We show the complete velocity and ve-
locity uncertainty maps of UGC 7899 that result from this
approach as an example in Figure 2.

2.4 Final Velocity Maps

Velocity ﬁeld pixels with the largest uncertainties tend to
be those for which ORCS failed to ﬁnd real emission and
instead returned the velocity of a spurious noise peak in
the vicinity of an input guess. In the outskirts of the galaxy
disc, spurious velocities quickly outnumber reliable ones and
destabilize the DiskFit models described in Section 3. To
avoid this, we ﬁlter out pixels with a velocity uncertainty
larger than a given value δVthres from the velocity maps re-
turned by the ORCS script described in Section 2.3. The
threshold values, δVthres are given in Table 1. Changes to
δVthres in the range 15-25 km s−1 produce minor changes to
the ﬁltered velocity ﬁeld input to DiskFit, but do not change
the characteristics of the models obtained. We note that for
the noisier UGC 8475 data, we additionally retained only
velocity map pixels at locations where the Hα ﬂux exceeded
Fthres = 4.8 × 10−17 erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2. This is subop-
timal, as a low-ﬂux pixel can still give an accurate measure
of gas velocity so long as the line peak is measured precisely.
We did not bin pixels spatially for UGC 7899, UGC 9037,
or UGC 9334, but used a bin size of 2 pixels for UGC 8475
to increase SNR at the cost of angular resolution. We ex-
perimented extensively with various bin sizes in order to
improve the ﬁlling factor of our velocity maps, but found

tortion, motivating a more quantitative analysis to constrain
non-circular ﬂows.

The patchy nature of the velocity maps suggests that
the observations trace spiral arms and the H II regions
within them, as opposed to the diﬀuse ionized gas (DIG)
(e.g. Haﬀner et al. 2009). This is especially apparent in
UGC 8475, UGC 9037, and UGC 9334, where their moder-
ate inclinations allow for a clearer distinction between arm
and interarm regions than in higher-inclination systems such
as UGC 7899. Unfortunately, since our observations probe
all ionized gas, we cannot disentangle H II regions from the
DIG, even though the latter has lower signal-to-noise. As
described in Section 3 below, the kinematic models that we
apply to the velocity maps are sensitive to coherent non-
circular ﬂows rather than local ones associated with indi-
vidual H II regions or spiral patterns. The velocity maps in
Figure 3 are therefore amenable to searches for radial ﬂows
from late accretion.

3 DATA ANALYSIS WITH DISKFIT

In this section we model the SITELLE velocity maps of
HIghMass galaxies presented in Figure 3 to search for non-
circular ﬂows. We describe the kinematic DiskFit models
that we adopt in Section 3.1 and the application of those
models to the velocity maps in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. We
combine our kinematic models of UGC 7899 and UGC 9037
with photometric decompositions to determine our preferred
models for each of these galaxies in Section 3.4. DiskFit is
a publicly available code2 developed by Spekkens & Sell-
wood (2007), Sellwood & S´anchez (2010), and Sellwood &
Spekkens (2015) for the purpose of modelling asymmetries
in the photometry (images) or kinematics (velocity maps) of
disc galaxies.

3.1 Kinematic Models

The kinematic branch of DiskFit applies physically-
motivated models to velocity maps of galaxies in order
to constrain the disc geometry and kinematic components.

that binning pixels for galaxies other than UGC 8475 had
no noticeable impact on the kinematic models.

Figure 3 presents the ﬁnal velocity and velocity-
uncertainty maps for UGC 7899, UGC 8475, UGC 9037,
and UGC 9334. Not all galaxy maps are ﬁlled out to the
same extent. For example, though the observing conditions
for UGC 7899 were better than they were for UGC 9037,
they were less optimal than the conditions for UGC 9334.
In addition, UGC 7899 appears to be more complete relative
to UGC 9037 and UGC 9334 because it is at a higher incli-
nation. Despite the diﬀerences in data quality, all galaxies
show signs of ordered rotation with no obvious signs of dis-

While DiskFit has the capacity to ﬁt for simple warps (Sell-
wood & Spekkens 2015), we consider only models of thin
ﬂat discs deﬁned by a kinematic centre (xc, yc), disc posi-
tion angle (φ(cid:48)
d), heliocentric systemic velocity (Vsys), and an
inclination (i), that do not vary with radius. A thin, ﬂat disc
is a reasonable assumption for the HIghMass galaxies given
their intermediate inclinations, the lack of strong warps in
their H I distributions (Hallenbeck et al. 2016) as well as the
fact that Hα lies primarily within the optical radius beyond
where warps tend to begin. In particular, the radius of the
disc at the 25th mag/arcsec2 isophote well exceeds the ex-
tent of our velocity maps for all of the galaxies (Huang et al.
2014), and warps in the radial range probed by our maps are
therefore unlikely (Briggs 1990; Garc´ıa-Ruiz et al. 2002).

We consider three physically-motivated kinematic mod-
els. The rotation-only model assumes that all of the detected
gas follows circular orbits as a function of galactocentric ra-
dius r about the galaxy centre:

Vmodel = Vsys + sin(i) (cid:2) ¯Vt(r) cos(θ)(cid:3) ,
where Vmodel is the modelled line of sight velocity, ¯Vt(r) is
the mean tangential velocity component at a given galacto-
centric radius, and θ is measured relative to the major axis
in the plane of the disc.

(1)

We also consider models with radial ﬂows which may
be indicative of accreting gas. In the radial ﬂow model, gas
ﬂows axisymetrically on both tangential and radial orbits:

(2)

Vmodel = Vsys + sin(i) (cid:2) ¯Vt(r) cos(θ) + ¯Vr(r) sin(θ)(cid:3) ,
where ¯Vr(r) is the mean radial velocity component at a
given radius. The physical interpretation of ¯Vr(r) depends
on which side of the disc minor axis is nearest to the ob-
server: ¯Vr(r) > 0 corresponds to inﬂows if the nearest point
of the disc has θ = 90◦, and outﬂows if the nearest point has
θ = 270◦. DiskFit allows non-circular components such as
¯Vr to be ﬁt across the entire disc or out to a user-speciﬁed
truncation radius rt. Equations 1 and 2 highlight the po-
tential degeneracy between the disc kinematics and geom-
etry, whereby errors in the latter can produce spurious ra-
dial ﬂows or rotation curve features (e.g. Wong et al. 2004;
Spekkens & Sellwood 2007; Sellwood et al. 2021).

While the goal of this work is to search for radial ﬂows,
bisymmetric ﬂows such as those produced by bars have a
similar signature in velocity maps because both m = 0 and
m = 2 harmonics in the disc plane project to m(cid:48) = 1 har-
monics in the sky plane (Schoenmakers et al. 1997; Spekkens
& Sellwood 2007). We therefore also consider a bisymmetric
model for non-circular ﬂows detected in the inner disc:

Vmodel = Vsys + sin(i)

(cid:104) ¯Vt(r) cos(θ) − ¯V2,t(r) cos(2θb) cos(θ)

− ¯V2,r(r) sin(2θb) sin(θ)

(cid:105)

,

(3)

where ¯V2,t(r) and ¯V2,r(r) are the tangential and radial com-
ponents of the bisymmetric ﬂow for r < rt at a ﬁxed bar
position angle φb in the plane of the disc, and θb = θ − φb.
Since φb does not depend on r, the bisymmetric model is
not sensitive to ﬂows in spiral arms, which DiskFit is not

equipped to probe. Equation 3 shows that ¯V2,t(r) or ¯V2,r(r)
become degenerate with ¯Vt(r) when φb = 0 or φb = π
2 . This
implies DiskFit cannot disentangle bisymmetric ﬂows close
to the major or minor axis of the galaxy from rotation (e.g.
Randriamampandry et al. 2016).

The sky-plane bar angle φ(cid:48)

b of the bisymmetric ﬂow can
be calculated from the disc-plane bar angle φb and the disc
geometry (Spekkens & Sellwood 2007):

b = φ(cid:48)
φ(cid:48)

d + arctan(tan φb cos i).

(4)

Because of the 2θb dependence of the non-circular ﬂow
terms in Equation 3, the best ﬁtting φb can represent ei-
ther the major or minor axis of the corresponding bar-like
distortion to the potential. For bisymmetric ﬂows caused by
a stellar bar, the sky plane position angle therefore corre-
sponds to φ(cid:48)
b from Equation 4 computed from either φb or
(φb + 90◦). We report both possibilities for φ(cid:48)
b for our bisym-
metric models.

DiskFit accepts a number of input parameter values.
The geometric parameters that were allowed to vary in the
models we consider include the disc position angle φ(cid:48)
d, in-
clination i, best ﬁtting center (xc, yc) and Vsys. In the case
of a bisymmetric ﬂow model, φb is also a free parameter.
The model also depends on ﬁxed parameters to specify the
spatial extent of the ﬁt, such as the radial model extent as
well as rt for any non-circular ﬂows.

In Sections 3.2 and 3.3, we describe our application of
these kinematic models to the ﬁnal velocity and velocity-
uncertainty maps for UGC 7899, UGC 8475, UGC 9037
and UGC 9334 shown in Figure 3. In all models, param-
eter uncertainties are determined from 1000 radial-rescaled
bootstrap realizations of the velocity maps as described in
Sellwood & S´anchez (2010). In order to assess the validity
of features in best-ﬁtting models to each velocity map as a
whole, we also model subsets of the data deﬁned by their
kinematics. Speciﬁcally, we isolate the approaching and re-
ceding halves of the disc about the best-ﬁtting minor axis, as
well as the Northern and Southern halves above and below
the best-ﬁtting major axis. Segmenting was performed using
the disc geometry from the best-ﬁtting rotation-only model.
When modelling the segmented halves, we let the position
angle and inclination vary (but account for the inclination
in comparing the rotation curves of diﬀerent segments) and
keep the centre ﬁxed to that obtained by the rotation-only
model of the whole galaxy. Finally, we use the distances in
Table 1 to convert galactocentric radius from angular to lin-
ear units when plotting kinematic components.

3.2 Searching for radial ﬂows across the entire disc

One goal of the analysis presented here is to indirectly detect
accretion by constraining radial ﬂows, and this is where we
begin. The poor data quality of UGC 8475 evident in Fig-
ure 3 prohibits detailed kinematic modelling, particularly in
the inner disc where velocity uncertainties are high. Thus,
we apply the radial ﬂow model in Equation 2 to the velocity
and velocity-uncertainty maps of UGC 7899, UGC 9037, and
UGC 9334, with the truncation radius set to the model ex-
tent in order to search for radial ﬂows across the entire disc
of each galaxy. The resulting ¯Vr(r) from models of the entire
map (black line), as well as of subsets of the data deﬁned

Figure 4. From top to bottom, ¯Vr(r) in radial ﬂow models applied
across the entire discs of UGC 7899, UGC 9037, and UGC 9334.
In all panels, the black lines show ¯Vr(r) obtained by modelling
the velocity ﬁeld as a whole, whereas the coloured lines represent
models applied to subsets of the data. The green upside-down
triangles and cyan diamonds show ¯Vr(r) for halves North and
South of the major axis. The red crosses and blue squares track
the halves above and below the minor axis, which correspond to
the receding and approaching halves respectively for these three
galaxies (see Figure 3).

The shading in the bottom panel indicates the approximate
extent of a bar aligned along the major axis of UGC 9334, and
thus where ¯Vr(r) and ¯Vt(r) in Equation 2 are degenerate.

relative to the kinematic major and minor axes (coloured
lines) of each galaxy are shown in Figure 4. As discussed
in Section 3.1, a non-zero ¯Vr(r) does not necessarily imply
physical radial inﬂows; rather we interpret a non-zero ¯Vr(r)
as a signature of non-circular ﬂows to be more fully char-
acterized in subsequent sections. We have veriﬁed that the
radial ﬂow proﬁles are unchanged if the disc geometries in
the kinematic models are ﬁxed to photometric values from
Huang et al. (2014); we therefore ﬁnd it unlikely that the
non-circular ﬂows discussed below result from errors in the
disc geometry.

The top panel of Figure 4 shows that the radial ﬂow
models of UGC 7899 consistently ﬁnd a non-zero ¯Vr(r) for
r ≤ 5 kpc, suggesting that the model has uncovered coher-
ent non-circular ﬂows in the inner disc. Further out, there
are hints of non-zero ¯Vr(r) at r ∼ 10 kpc and 15 kpc (cid:46) r (cid:46)
20 kpc, with model amplitudes as large as 50 km s−1 in the
latter region. However, these signatures are less coherent
across models of diﬀerent data subsets compared to ¯Vr(r)
in the inner disc. The most discrepant among subset mod-
els is that from the Northern half (blue line and squares),
which we speculate arises from a dearth of data North of the
major axis beyond r = 10 kpc in the velocity map. This is
illustrated in Figure 5, where sky-plane projections of the lo-
cations with r = 10 kpc (inner black ellipse) and r = 15 kpc
(outer black ellipse) are superimposed on the velocity maps
for UGC 7899. Models of the approaching segment (blue
lines and squares in the top panel of Figure 4) also return
¯Vr(r) ∼ 0 for r > 15 kpc. We therefore conclude that there
is a clear signature of non-circular ﬂows for r < 5 kpc and
marginal evidence for non-circular ﬂows beyond this radius
in UGC 7899. In Section 3.3, we will model the non-circular
ﬂows in the inner disc as both radial ﬂows and a bar-like
ﬂow and determine our preferred physical model.

The middle panel of Figure 4 shows that the radial ﬂow
models of UGC 9037 consistently ﬁnd a non-zero ¯Vr(r) for
r (cid:46) 3.5 kpc, suggesting that these models, too, have un-
covered coherent non-circular ﬂows in the inner disc. On
the other hand, all of the models return ¯Vr(r) ∼ 0 be-
yond the inner disc, albeit with some scatter between mod-
els of diﬀerent data subsets. Adopting the uncertainties on
the model applied to the velocity map as a whole (black
line) as an approximate upper limit, our models imply that
¯Vr(r) < 15 km s−1 in the outer disc of UGC 9037. In Sec-
tion 3.3, we will model the non-circular ﬂows in the inner
disc as both radial ﬂows and a bar-like ﬂow and determine
our preferred physical model.

The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows that the best-
ﬁtting ¯Vr(r) to the entire velocity map for UGC 9334 (black
line) dips below 0 for 10 kpc (cid:46) r (cid:46) 15 kpc and above 0
for 20 kpc (cid:46) r (cid:46) 25 kpc. The latter ﬂows are not consis-
tently recovered in diﬀerent subsets of the data. We there-
fore ﬁnd no convincing signature of non-circular ﬂows for
r (cid:38) 3 kpc for UGC 9334, with the models suggesting that
¯Vr(r) < 20 km s−1 on average across the disc. There is strong
evidence that ¯Vr(r) < 0 for r (cid:46) 3 kpc in all of the models,
which implies coherent non-circular ﬂows in that region. We
speculate that they stem from a bar aligned along the ma-
jor axis of UGC 9334 (Willett et al. 2013) that is visible
in the bottom panel of Figure 1. We highlight the approx-
imate extent of the bar region in blue in the bottom panel
of Figure 4, and note that the DiskFit’s bisymmetric model

models. Their best-ﬁtting disc geometries are given in Ta-
ble 2, which are in good agreement with photometric mea-
surements (Huang et al. 2014). The best-ﬁtting ¯Vt(r) for
these models are given in Figure 6 for UGC 8475 and by
the black line in Figure 7 for UGC 9334. To the best of our
knowledge, Figures 6 and 7 present the ﬁrst rotation curve
measurements for these galaxies in any tracer. Both curves
are ﬂat or mildly rising out to the last measured point, and
their amplitudes are consistent with estimates from single-
dish H I proﬁle widths and photometric disc inclinations
(Huang et al. 2014). We note that the Hα rotation curves
of massive galaxies are generally ﬂat (e.g. Catinella et al.
2006), and therefore that the mild rotation curve rise in both
galaxies could stem from a missed warp in our ﬂat disc mod-
els. However, the warp would need to begin well within the
edge of the optical disc in both galaxies, which we consider
unlikely.

The coloured lines in Figure 7 show ¯Vt(r) obtained from
rotation-only models applied to halves of the UGC 9334 ve-
locity map in Figure 3, deﬁned from the kinematic major and
minor axes of the whole-disc model given in Table 2. Models
for the (statistically independent) Northern and Southern
halves agree well within uncertainty across the disc, and all
of the curves are generally consistent for r > 15 kpc. How-
ever, for 3 kpc < r < 10 kpc, ¯Vt(r) for the receding (above
minor axis) half of UGC 9334 consistently exceeds that for
the approaching (below minor axis) half by ∼ 30km s−1,
suggesting a degree of kinematic lopsidedness. Relatively iso-
lated galaxies do sometimes exhibit morphological and kine-
matic asymmetries (e.g. Greisen et al. 2009; Reynolds et al.
2020), and the origin of this feature in UGC 9334 deserves
further study that we reserve for future work.

3.3.2 UGC 7899

Informed by the whole-disc radial ﬂow models of Section 3.2,
we apply rotation-only, inner bisymmetric and inner radial
ﬂow models to the velocity and velocity-uncertainty maps
for UGC 7899 in Figure 3. In all models, we set the trunca-
tion radius for the non-circular ﬂows as rt = 4.9 kpc, which
corresponds to the approximate extent of the coherent fea-
ture in the top panel of Figure 4 in integer pixel units; the
models do not depend strongly on this choice, with values in
the range 4.5 kpc < rt < 5.5 kpc returning similar results.
Figure 8 presents the best-ﬁtting models and residuals, Fig-

lipse) and r = 15 kpc (outer black ellipse) in the disc plane for
the best-ﬁtting kinematic model geometry in our preferred model
of UGC 7899 (Table 2) superimposed on the ﬁnal velocity map.
There is a dearth of data North of the kinematic major axis in
the map, which likely explains the discrepant ¯Vr(r) relative to
other radial ﬂow models in Figure 4 as well as the dip in the ro-
tation curve for UGC 7899 in that region in Figure 9. See text for
details.

(Equation 3) is degenerate for this geometry (Randriamam-
pandry et al. 2016; see Section 3.1). In Section 3.3, we will
therefore apply rotation-only models to the velocity map of
UGC 9334, with the caveat that they do not reliably trace
the physical structure of this system in the bar region.

3.3 Application of Kinematic Models

Informed by the radial ﬂow search of the previous section,
we present the rotation-only models to the velocity and
velocity-uncertainty maps for all four galaxies, as well as
inner bisymmetric and radial ﬂow models for UGC 7899
and UGC 9037. Section 3.3.1 presents rotation-only mod-
els for UGC 8475 and UGC 9334, and Sections 3.3.2 and
3.3.3 present applications of all three models to UGC 7899
and UGC 9037 respectively. The best-ﬁtting geometries for
all models are given in Table 2, and Figures 6 − 11 show
the models, residuals, and kinematic components. In Sec-
tion 3.4 we discuss our preferred models for UGC 7899 and
UGC 9037 among those applied to the data.

3.3.1 UGC 8475 and UGC 9334

As discussed in Section 3.2, the sparsity of the UGC 8475
data and the bar along the UGC 9334 major axis limit our
analysis of the velocity and velocity-uncertainty maps in Fig-
ure 3 for these objects to the application of rotation-only

disc geometry and rotation curves. The disc geometries are
consistent with previous photometric estimates from R-band
imaging (Huang et al. 2014, see also Section 3.4) and kine-
matic measurements from models applied to H I maps (Hal-
lenbeck et al. 2016).

We ﬁnd a ∼ 35km s−1 dip in ¯Vt(r) at r ∼ 13 kpc in
all three models, as well as in rotation-only models run on
diﬀerent subsets of the data relative to the kinematic ma-
jor and minor axes deﬁned by the disc geometry in Table 2.
We attribute this dip to a combination of UGC 7899 ve-
locity map properties from 10 kpc < r < 15 kpc in the
disc plane, a region highlighted by the black sky-plane el-
lipses in Figure 5. First, there is a clear dearth of emission
in the Northern (above major axis) half of the disc: this
likely underpins the change in ¯Vt(r) for the Northern half
of the galaxy (green line and upside-down triangles in up-
per panel of Figure 9) and the discrepancy in ¯Vr(r) in the
whole-disc radial ﬂow models (green line and upside-down
triangles in upper panel of Figure 4) for that subset. The gas
signature picks up beyond r > 15 kpc along the major axis
in particular, resulting in a rotation curve which recovers to
its previous plateau. Second, Figure 5 shows some evidence
for a disconnect between the gas in the Southern half of the
disc in that region and the emission at smaller r that may
connect to the tail-like structure to the South-West of the
galaxy. Ultimately, the dip in ¯Vt(r) at r ∼ 13 kpc most likely
stems from a complexity in the kinematics that is missing
in our models rather than a change in the underlying mass
distribution of UGC 7899 in the Hα tracer. This may corre-
spond to a warp in the disc, although it would lie well within
the outer H I disc warp suggested by Hallenbeck et al. (2016)
as well as the edge of the stellar disc (Huang et al. 2014).

Figure 9 also shows that the inner non-circular com-
ponents ¯V2,t(r) and ¯V2,r(r) in the bisymmetric model and
¯Vr(r) in the radial ﬂow model are both well-constrained,
with similar extents, amplitudes and uncertainties. Com-
bined with the similarities between the models, residuals
and ¯Vt(r) from Figures 8 and 9, we therefore ﬁnd that the
inner bisymmetric model and the inner radial ﬂow model de-
scribe the kinematics of UGC 7899 equally well. We discuss
our preferred model between the two in Section 3.4, and its
physical implications in Section 4.

Figure 7. ¯Vt(r) in rotation-only model for UGC 9334 applied
to the velocity and velocity-uncertainty maps in Figure 3. The
black points show ¯Vt(r) obtained by modelling the whole galaxy,
whereas the coloured lines represent models run on diﬀerent
halves of the disc, relative to the kinematic major and minor
axes of the whole-disc models, as described in the legend. For
UGC 9334, the segment above the minor axis corresponds to the
receding half of the disc, and the segment below the minor axis
corresponds to the approaching half. The shaded region is the
same as in Figure 4, and highlights the region where ¯Vt(r) does
not reliably trace rotation because of a bar aligned along the ma-
jor axis (see Figure 1).

ure 9 shows the kinematic components from the models, and
Table 2 reports the best-ﬁtting disc geometries.

Figure 8 shows that by eye, the data-model residuals in
the inner disc of UGC 7899 are both larger and more coher-
ent for the best-ﬁtting rotation-only model than for either
the best-ﬁtting inner bisymmetric or inner radial ﬂow mod-
els. The latter two models are nearly indistinguishable in
the sky plane, and the slightly larger residuals for the radial
ﬂow model relative to the bisymmetric model are expected
from its smaller number of ﬁtted parameters.

The kinematic components in Figure 9 and the disc ge-
ometries in Table 2 are well-constrained in all three mod-
els. Consistent with the ﬁndings of Holmes et al. (2015) for
the CALIFA sample, the disc geometries and axisymmetric
tangential components ¯Vt(r) between diﬀerent models are
identical to within uncertainty: all models return the same

dashed ellipse extends to the truncation radius rt (only phys-
ically relevant for the bisymmetric and radial ﬂow models but
plotted on the rotation-only model for consistency), within which
the discrepancy between the rotation-only and non-circular ﬂow
models is most severe. The black bar in the residual panels shows
the angular scale, and the colour bars show the velocity scale in
each column.

3.3.3 UGC 9037

Informed by the whole-disc radial ﬂow models of Section 3.2,
we apply rotation-only, inner bisymmetric and inner radial
ﬂow models to the velocity and velocity-uncertainty maps for
UGC 9037 in Figure 3. In all models, we set the truncation
radius for the non-circular ﬂows as rt = 3.3 kpc, which corre-
sponds to the approximate extent of the coherent feature in
the top panel of Figure 4 in integer pixel units; the models do
not depend strongly on this choice, with values in the range
3 < rt < 4 kpc returning similar results. Figure 10 presents
the best-ﬁtting models and residuals, Figure 11 shows the
kinematic components from the models, and Table 2 reports
the best-ﬁtting disc geometries.

The kinematic components in Figure 11 and the disc ge-
ometries in Table 2 are well-constrained in all three models.
The disc geometries are consistent with previous photomet-

the coloured lines represent ¯Vt(r) obtained from models run on
diﬀerent halves of the disc, relative to the kinematic major and
minor axes of the whole-disc models, as described in the legend,
with marker symbols consistent with Figure 4. In b), the blue and
red lines correspond to the tangential and radial components of
the bisymmetric ﬂow, ¯V2,t(r) and ¯V2,r(r) respectively. In c), the
green line corresponds to the inner-disc radial ﬂow, ¯Vr(r). The
∼35 km s−1 amplitude dip in ¯Vt(r) at r ∼ 13 kpc in all models
is likely due to a lack of data within that region of the disc (see
Figure 5 and text for details).

halves of the data relative to the kinematic major axis of the
whole disc model as described in the legend. The models for
these data subsets are generally consistent with one another,
particular for r < 10 kpc.

Figure 10 shows that by eye, the data-model residuals in
the inner disc of UGC 9037 are both larger and more coher-
ent for the best-ﬁtting rotation-only model than for either

eters from these runs are reported in Table 3, and can be
compared with their kinematically derived counterparts in
Table 2. We determine our preferred kinematic model by re-
quiring that the implied structure is broadly consistent with
our best-ﬁtting photometric decompositions.

els. The larger uncertainties in the inner bisymmetric ﬂows
(as compared to the inner radial ﬂow model) are character-
istic of bootstrap resampling with a model that has more
free parameters (e.g. Holmes et al. 2015). As is the case
for UGC 7899, the best-ﬁtting inner bisymmetric and inner
radial ﬂow models are nearly indistinguishable in the sky
plane. The similarities between the models, residuals and
¯Vt(r) from Figures 10 and 11 respectively, preclude draw-
ing conclusions from kinematic modelling alone. We discuss
our preferred model for UGC 9037 in Section 3.4, and its
physical implications in Section 4.

3.4 Preferred models for UGC 7899 and UGC 9037

Our analysis of the velocity and velocity-uncertainty maps
for UGC 7899 and UGC 9037 in Section 3.3.2 and 3.3.3
proved inconclusive with regard to determining the ideal
kinematic model for either system. Thus, we combine our
kinematic analysis with photometric modelling to deter-
mine our preferred physical model. We use the photomet-
ric branch of DiskFit to model the R-band imaging for
UGC 7899 and UGC 9037 presented in Huang et al. (2014).
The photometric branch of DiskFit, which uses the
same optimization algorithm as for the kinematic branch,
can decompose images into disc, bar and bulge components

As a check, we re-ran the disc-bar-bulge photometric models
for UGC 9037 with the disc geometry ﬁxed to the kinematic
values and recover a φ(cid:48)
b, phot that is consistent with the one
reported in Table 3. This is not unexpected since the photo-
metric disc geometry in a ﬂat-disc model is typically driven
by the outer disc morphology, while the photometric bar
geometry is driven by that of the inner disc.

The lack of consistency between the disc geometry and
bar angle for the inner bisymmetric ﬂow model and for the
disc-bulge-bar decomposition for UGC 7899 implies that we
cannot ﬁnd a bar-like model that consistently reproduces its
kinematics and morphology. We therefore favour inner radial
ﬂows to explain the non-circular motions in UGC 7899. Con-
versely, our kinematic and photometric models of UGC 9037
can be consistently modelled with an inner bar, and we
favour this interpretation for its underlying structure.

4 DISCUSSION

In this Section, we discuss the implications of the kinematic
models presented in Section 3 for the physical structure of
the HIghMass galaxies and the late accretion hypothesis. We
place our preferred models for UGC 7899 and UGC 9037 in
the context of other constraints on their structure in Sec-
tion 4.1. In Section 4.2, we consider our constraints on disc-
wide radial ﬂows for UGC 7899, UGC 9037, and UGC 9334
in the context of hot and cold gas accretion models.

4.1 The Structure of UGC 7899 and UGC 9037

While both our inner radial ﬂow models and inner bisym-
metric models for UGC 7899 and UGC 9037 adequately de-
scribe the measured Hα kinematics for these systems (Sec-
tions 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 respectively), a comparison between the
implied inner-disc structure with photometric disc-bar-bulge
decompositions suggest inner radial ﬂows in UGC 7899 and
inner bisymmetric ﬂows in UGC 9037. Here, we discuss those
interpretations in the context of other constraints on those
systems as well as in the broader gas-rich galaxy population.
Our preferred model for UGC 7899 is that of a disc
galaxy with inner radial ﬂows and marginal evidence for
non-circular ﬂows beyond the inner disc. We therefore do
not corroborate consistent ¯Vr(r) ∼ 20 km s−1 radial ﬂows
for 10 (cid:46) r (cid:46) 20 kpc suggested by some of the H I modelling

presented by Hallenbeck et al. (2016). However, our results
are still consistent with the overall picture of this galaxy’s
morphology, structure, and star formation from that study.
In both H I and Hα, UGC 7899’s Hα distribution is
visibly asymmetric (see Figures 1 and 3). Emission at the
northern, receding edge is more extended than the southern,
approaching lobe, which narrows (see Figure 2). Hallenbeck
et al. (2016) also show that the position angle of the H I
disc changes beyond r ∼ 20 kpc. These anisotropies may
indicate an H I warp, and the disconnect between the gas
in the Southern half of the disc and the emission at smaller
radii for 10 kpc < r < 15 kpc (Figure 5) may be related. We
return to the warp and outer disc kinematics in UGC 7899
in the context of late accretion in Section 4.2.

Under the assumption of trailing spiral arms (Lindblad
1963; Contopoulos 1971), we can determine the direction
of ﬁtted radial ﬂows in UGC 7899 as per Equation 2. The
spiral arm structure of UGC 7899 suggests that its motion
is clockwise in the plane of the sky. This implies that the
Eastern semi-minor axis (θ = 90◦) is the nearest point of
the disc, and therefore that ¯Vr(r) > 0 detected represents
inﬂows.

Hallenbeck et al. (2016) found that the surface densi-
ties of H I and H2 gas reach values of 30 M(cid:12) pc−2 and
10 M(cid:12) pc−2 respectively in UGC 7899, implying that this
gas is marginally unstable within r < 30 kpc, and strongly
unstable for r < 10 kpc. Since UGC 7899 is observed to most
actively form stars in its inner regions, this is consistent with
inner radial inﬂow. UGC 7899 has a typical SFR for its H2
mass, and its star formation eﬃciency drops as a function of
disc radius, suggesting that the bottleneck for star formation
is the atomic to molecular (H I-to-H2) conversion pathway
(Hallenbeck et al. 2016). This in turn suggests imminent star
formation in the central regions.

If the radial ﬂows we detect are fuelling this inner-disc
star formation, then their peak amplitude ¯Vr ∼ 10 km s−1
at r ∼ 2 kpc for UGC 7899 in Figure 9c allows for an
estimate of the gaseous mass inﬂux µ for a thin axisym-
metric disc via µ = 2πrΣg ¯Vr. If the ﬂows detected in our
Hα maps are present in the molecular and atomic phases,
then adopting a characteristic Σg ∼ 40 M(cid:12) pc−2 (Hallen-
beck et al. 2016) implies a mass inﬂow µ ∼ 5 M(cid:12) yr−1 or
Σµ ∼ 0.4 M(cid:12) yr−1 kpc−2 within that radius. If this gas
will be turned into stars to avoid the continuity problem
implied by radial ﬂows (Wong et al. 2004; Spekkens & Sell-
wood 2007), then the corresponding star formation rate and
central surface density exceeds estimates from Hα imaging
for UGC 7899 and other HIghMass galaxies (Huang et al.
2014). This further supports the conclusion that our pre-
ferred model for the inner non-circular ﬂows implies an im-
minent phase of signiﬁcant central star formation.

Our results for UGC 9037 favour inner-disc non-circular
ﬂows that can be explained by the bar that is visible in im-
ages of this galaxy (Figure 1). The extent and amplitude
of the inner bisymmetric ﬂow are broadly commensurate
with that found in Hα in CALIFA galaxies (Holmes et al.
2015). We do not corroborate the widespread non-circular
ﬂows farther out identiﬁed in some H I kinematic models
in Hallenbeck et al. (2014), instead placing an upper limit
¯Vr(r) (cid:46) 15 km s−1 on their amplitude for r (cid:38) 5 kpc (Sec-
tion 3.2). We discuss the implications of this limit in the
context of late accretion in Section 4.2.

MNRAS 000, 1–15 (2021)

While some H I models for UGC 9037 in Hallenbeck
et al. (2014) also suggested the presence of non-circular ﬂows
in the inner disc, they are distinct from the ones that we de-
tect in Hα. Importantly, the orientation of the central minor-
axis twist in the H I velocity maps (Figure 2 in Hallenbeck
et al. 2014) is opposite the one evident in the non-circular
ﬂow models of the Hα velocity maps presented here (Fig-
ure 10). When these signatures are both modelled as radial
ﬂows, the H I feature represents inﬂow while the Hα fea-
ture represents outﬂow if the spiral arms in UGC 9037 are
trailing.

While we prefer a bisymmetric ﬂow to explain the inner
non-circular ﬂows that we detect in UGC 9037 because of
their consistency with photometric models, we also note that
the outﬂows implied by our inner disc radial ﬂow models are
challenging to reconcile with constraints from other tracers.
Gas outﬂows can plausibly result from intense star formation
(Nath & Silk 2009), but we have no evidence for such an
event in UGC 9037.

The speciﬁc star formation rate and central H I surface
density of UGC 9037 are both greater than the typical value
for a galaxy with the same stellar mass (Huang et al. 2014;
Hallenbeck et al. 2014), and a variety of axisymmetric insta-
bility indicators (see Section 1) suggest that the H I phase is
marginally unstable in the inner region as well. These past
observations indicate that UGC 9037 may be on the verge
of a signiﬁcant central star formation phase. Our preferred
kinematic model for UGC 9037 - that of an axisymmetric
outer disc with an inner bar - may be consistent with this
basic picture, since bars can eﬃciently shuttle gas into the
galaxy interior (Oh et al. 2011). However, since bars are long-
lived this scenario implies that we are observing the system
at a special time, and it is therefore more likely that the bar
and central star formation potential are disconnected.

While galaxies with strong bars tend to be less gas
rich than those without (Masters et al. 2012), our kinematic
model for UGC 9037 as well as the bar in UGC 9334 that
precludes a search for inner non-circular ﬂows (see Figure 1
and Section 3.2) suggest that weak bars may be as common
in massive gas-rich galaxies just as they are in the broader
galaxy population (e.g. Erwin 2018). Notwithstanding the
small sample size considered here, this correspondence may
suggest that massive, gas-rich galaxies evolve secularly in a
similar manner to other galaxies.

4.2 Radial Flows and Late Accretion

We now turn to the implications of our constraints on non-
circular ﬂows in UGC 7899, UGC 9037 and UGC 9334 for the
late accretion hypothesis. As outlined in Section 1, cosmolog-
ical simulations suggest hot-mode accretion as the dominant
mechanism in the HIghMass galaxies given their relatively
high stellar masses. On the other hand, the high gas-richness
of the HIghMass galaxies raises the possibility that recent
cold-mode accretion played a role in building their H I reser-
voirs. We discuss both possibilities below.

To examine the hot-mode accretion scenario, we follow
the analytic framework described in Pezzulli & Fraternali

MNRAS 000, 1–15 (2021)

Non-circular ﬂows in HighMass galaxies

13

(2016), and estimate the accretion rate surface density in
the outer disc as

˙Σacc =

Σg ¯Vr
αr

,

(5)

where α is a unitless parameter measuring the local angu-
lar momentum deﬁcit of the infalling material relative to
the corotating disc ﬂow. For α (cid:38) 0.2 the corresponding disc
radial ﬂow amplitude grows with increasing r, and we there-
fore use the results of the disc-wide radial ﬂow searches in
Section 3.2 to constrain the accretion due to radial inﬂows
in the outer discs of UGC 9037 and UGC 9334 which may
have gone undetected at the resolution and sensitivity of our
observations.

Neither galaxy shows evidence for radial ﬂows in their
outer discs (see Figure 4). Adopting ¯Vr(r) < 20 km s−1 at
r ∼ 15 kpc appropriate for UGC 9334 as a conservative
upper limit on the radial inﬂow amplitude that we can de-
tect, a total disc gas surface density of Σg(r = 15 kpc) ∼
10M(cid:12) pc−2 (e.g. Hallenbeck et al. 2014), and an angular
momentum mismatch α = 0.3 on the higher end of that
considered by Pezzulli & Fraternali (2016), Equation 5 im-
plies an upper limit on the accretion rate surface density of
˙Σacc < 45 M(cid:12) pc−2 Gyr−1 in UGC 9037 and UGC 9334.
This is substantially higher than the current star formation
rate densities of HIghMass galaxies Huang et al. (2014), as
well as that of the Milky Way. Furthermore, given the inverse
relationship betwen ˙Σacc and α, our outer disc radial ﬂow
constraints allow for substantially higher ˙Σacc values than
estimated here for smaller angular momentum mismatches.
Thus, while we do not ﬁnd evidence for outer disc radial
ﬂows in UGC 9037 and UGC 9334, we have found weak
constraints on hot-mode accretion via these implied upper
limits on outer disc radial ﬂows. In particular, the predicted
accretion rates for the Milky Way are much smaller than
we can detect in the velocity maps, and as such they are
consistent with our data.

In Section 3.4, we advocated radial ﬂows as the pre-
ferred model for the inner disc (r (cid:46) 5 kpc) kinematics of
UGC 7899, and in Section 4.1, we argued that inﬂows of
the measured amplitude are consistent with other observa-
tions which suggest imminent central star formation in this
galaxy. We now discuss possible origins of these ﬂows. The
inconsistency between the radial dependence of the ﬂow con-
straints in UGC 7899 and that expected from the hot-mode
accretion models of Pezzulli & Fraternali (2016) suggests
that, if late accretion is at work, then cold-mode accretion
is the more likely explanation. This latter scenario would
require a signiﬁcant mass ﬂow of cold gas to reach the inner
disc of UGC 7899 (Section 4.1, Hallenbeck et al. 2016).

Unlike UGC 9037 and UGC 9334, UGC 7899 does have
hints of outer disc radial ﬂows that broadly increase with
radius (see 4), as well as evidence for a disconnect between
the detected Hα emission at 10 kpc (cid:46) r (cid:46) 15 kpc and that in
the rest of the disc (see Figure 5). It is also the only HIgh-
Mass galaxy imaged in H I thus far that shows evidence
for an outer warp in that tracer (Hallenbeck et al. 2016).
Among galaxies examined in this work, then, UGC 7899 is
the best candidate for late accretion, where both hot-mode
(outer disc radial ﬂows; e.g. Pezzulli & Fraternali 2016) and
cold-mode (outer disc warp; e.g. Shen & Sellwood 2006) ac-

14 D. Bisaria et. al.

cretion mechanisms may be at work. Attributing these fea-
tures to late accretion is premature, however, given the well-
known degeneracy between disc geometry and non-circular
ﬂows in kinematic models (see Section 3.1). If UGC 7899
does harbour a warp that begins far within the optical disc
(Section 3.3.2), then the application of ﬂat-disc models in
Section 3.2 may return spurious radial ﬂow signatures. A
cursory examination of this eﬀect in the H I mapping data
for UGC 7899 was carried out in Hallenbeck et al. (2016),
and a joint H I + Hα kinematic analysis may help disen-
tangle a warp and any outer radial ﬂows. We leave that
signiﬁcant task for future work.

Beyond the non-circular ﬂows examined here, a future
step for constraining the origin of the large H I reservoirs
in HIghMass galaxies is to compare gas-phase metallicities
to predictions from accretion models as well as to search for
pristine accreting gas (Pezzulli & Fraternali 2016; Fraternali
& Pezzulli 2018). SITELLE’s narrow SN3 ﬁlter precludes
this study from the data in-hand, but observations with its
SN1 and SN2 ﬁlters would aﬀord line ratio measurements to
carry out such an investigation (e.g. Rousseau-Nepton et al.
2018; Moumen et al. 2019; Flagey et al. 2020). But in this
work, we have not found direct evidence for late accretion
in the HIghMass galaxies examined.

5 CONCLUSION

We have presented new Hα velocity maps of the HIghMass
systems UGC 7899, UGC 8475, UGC 9037, and UGC 9334,
obtained with the SITELLE Imaging Fourier Transform
Spectrometer on CFHT, in order to search for non-circular
ﬂows indicating late gas accretion that might explain the
large H I reservoirs in these galaxies.

The SITELLE hyperspectral velocity cubes were cali-
brated with the ORCS package to produce arcsecond veloc-
ity and velocity-uncertainty maps (Section 2). The maps for
UGC 7899, UGC 9037 and UGC 9334 are suitable for de-
tailed kinematic modelling, but the poor sensitivity of the
UGC 8475 maps due to distributed photon noise from the
Moon precludes searches for non-circular ﬂows in this object.
We proceed to apply kinematic models to the velocity
maps for UGC 7899, UGC 9037 and UGC 9334 using the
DiskFit algorithm (Section 3). We ﬁnd no evidence for ra-
dial ﬂows in the outer discs of UGC 9037 and UGC 9334,
placing conservative upper limits of ¯Vr (cid:46) 15 km s−1 and
¯Vr (cid:46) 20 km s−1 for r (cid:38) 5 kpc, respectively (Section 3.2).
There are hints of outer disc radial ﬂows in UGC 7899 with
amplitudes as large at ¯Vr ∼ 50 km s−1.

We ﬁnd clear signatures of non-circular ﬂows in the in-
ner discs of UGC 7899, UGC 9037 and UGC 9334. The ma-
jor axis alignment of a bar-like optical feature in UGC 9334
precludes detailed modelling of that system, but we apply
rotation-only, inner radial ﬂow models and inner bisymmet-
ric models to the velocity maps for UGC 7899 and UGC 9037
to determine the likely origin of those asymmetries (Sec-
tion 3.3). We ﬁnd that inner radial ﬂow and inner bisym-
metric models describe their kinematics equally well, and
determine our preferred model for each galaxy by carrying
out disc-bulge-bar decompositions of R-band imaging using
the photometric branch of DiskFit and requiring physical
consistency with the kinematic models (Section 3.4). As a
result of this exercise, our preferred model for UGC 7899

is found to be a disc with inner radial ﬂows and marginal
non-circular ﬂows beyond, whereas UGC 9037 is best char-
acterized as a disc with an inner bisymmetric ﬂow and ax-
isymmetric rotation in the outer disc.

Our preferred model for UGC 7899 is an axisymmetric
outer disc with inner radial inﬂows. In this scenario, its en-
hanced central H I surface density indicates that UGC 7899
may be in the midst of a signiﬁcant star formation episode
(Section 4.1). We do not corroborate the coherent outer disc
ﬂows in this system implied by some lower-resolution H I
kinematic models, but there are hints of asymmetries at
large r in our Hα maps including non-zero radial ﬂow com-
ponents, asymmetries in the Hα distribution as well as a
dip in the rotation curve that likely stems from a discon-
nect between the gas in the Southern half of the disc at
10 < r < 15 kpc and that in the rest of the disc.

We posit that UGC 9037 harbours a weak inner bar that
is shuttling gas toward the galaxy centre, consistent with the
high inner H I and CO surface density measured in this sys-
tem and suggesting an upcoming episode of star formation
(Section 4.1). While we only favour a bar model for this
galaxy to explain its inner-disc kinematics, the photomet-
ric and kinematic signatures of weak bars in UGC 7899 and
UGC 9334 as well suggest that, as with the broader galaxy
population, these structures may be common in HIghMass
galaxies.

With hints of outer disc radial ﬂows and an outer disc
warp, UGC 7899 is the best candidate for late accretion
among the galaxies examined (Section 4.2). However, this
interpretation is muddled by the well-known degeneracy be-
tween non-circular ﬂows and disc warps in kinematic models,
which may be at work in the ﬂat-disc DiskFit models that
we have applied. A careful joint H I + Hα kinematic analysis
of UGC 7899 that allows for outer disc warps may help dis-
entangle these eﬀects, and gas-phase metallicity information
would also add additional constraints on late accretion.

In this work, we have found weak constraints on hot-
mode accretion from upper limits on outer disc radial ﬂows
implied by our data, but have not found direct evidence for
accretion in the HIghMass galaxies examined.
