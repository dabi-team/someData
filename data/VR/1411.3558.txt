1 Introduction

Classical Cepheids – F–K-type supergiants with ages from
20 to 200 Myr (Efremov 2003, Bono et al. 2005) – are good
tracers of the Galactic spiral structure and regions of high
gas density. Due to the period-luminosity relation the dis-
tances to classical Cepheids can be determined with an ac-
curacy of ∼ 10% (Berdnikov, Dambis & Vozyakova 2000;
Sandage & Tammann 2006).

Most of the recent studies of the spiral structure of the
Galaxy (see e.g. the review by Vall´ee (2013) and references
therein) have typically suggested a 2- or 4-armed spiral pat-
tern with a pitch angle of nearly i = 6◦ or 12◦, respectively.
In our previous studies (Mel’nik & Rautiainen 2009; Rauti-
ainen & Mel’nik 2010) we proposed an alternative to these
purely spiral models – a two-component outer ring R1R′
2.

The main advantage of the 4-armed spiral model is that
it can explain the distribution of HII regions in the Galactic
disk (Georgelin & Georgelin 1976; Russeil 2003; and other
papers) and the existence of so-called tangential directions
related to the maxima in the thermal radio continuum, HI
and CO emission which are associated with the tangents to
the spiral arms (Englmaier & Gerhard 1999; Vall´ee 2008).
The main shortcoming of this approach is the absence
of a dynamical mechanism to maintain the global spiral
pattern for a long time period (more than a few disk ro-
tations) (Toomre 1977; Athanassoula 1984). Generally, the
bar could support the spiral pattern, but in this case the spi-
ral pattern must rotate with the angular velocity of the bar
(Ωs = Ωb) (Englmaier & Gerhard 1999). The estimates of

the corotation radius (CR) of the Galactic bar do not ex-
ceed 5 kpc, which gives the lower limit for its angular ve-
locity Ωb > 40 km s−1 kpc−1 (Weiner & Sellwood 1999).
However, this model cannot explain the kinematics of the
Perseus region: the direction of the velocities of young stars
in the Perseus region, if interpreted in terms of the density-
wave concept (Lin, Yuan & Shu 1969), indicates that a frag-
ment of a Perseus arm must be located inside the corota-
tion circle (CR) (Burton & Bania 1974; Mel’nik, Dambis &
Rastorguev 2001; Mel’nik 2003; Sitnik 2003) implying an
upper limit Ωs < 25 km s−1 kpc−1 for its pattern speed,
which is inconsistent with the one mentioned above. At-
tempts have been undertaken to overcome this contradiction
by introducing an analytical spiral potential rotating slower
than the bar (Bissantz, Englmaier & Gerhard 2003). Note
that numerical simulations show that galactic stellar disks
can develop modes that rotate slower than the bar (Sellwood
& Sparke 1988; Masset & Tagger 1997; Rautiainen & Salo
1999, 2000). However, it is questionable whether the ampli-
tude of slow modes can be large enough to determine the
kinematics at twice the radius of the CR of the Galactic bar.
Another concept of the Galactic spiral structure is that
the disk rather than global modes forms transient spi-
ral arms. Sellwood (2000, 2010) advances the idea that
fresh and decaying instabilities are connected through reso-
nances, which is based on some speciﬁc features in the an-
gular momentum distribution of old stars in the solar vicin-
ity. Baba et al. (2009) build a model of the Galaxy with
transient spiral arms, which can explain the large peculiar
velocities, 20–30 km s−1, of maser sources in the Galactic
disk. Transient spiral arms must heat the galactic disk in few
disk rotation periods (Sellwood & Carlberg 1984). We can

suggest that young massive stars born in such arms should
also acquire large peculiar velocities. However, young stel-
lar objects (classical Cepheids, young open clusters, OB-
associations) in the wide solar neighborhood move in nearly
circular orbits with average velocity deviations of 7–13 km
s−1 from the rotation curve (Zabolotskikh, Rastorguev &
Dambis 2002; Mel’nik & Dambis 2009; Bobylev & Baikova
2012; and other papers).

Models of the Galaxy with the outer ring R1R′

2 can re-
produce well the radial and azimuthal components of the
residual velocities (after substracting the velocity due to the
rotation curve and the solar motion to the apex) of OB-
associations in the Sagittarius and Perseus stellar-gas com-
plexes identiﬁed by Efremov & Sitnik (1988). The radial
velocities of most OB-associations in the Perseus region are
directed toward the Galactic center and this indicates the
presence of the ring R2 in the Galaxy, while the radial ve-
locities in the Sagittarius region are directed away from the
Galactic center suggesting the existence of the ring R1. The
nearly zero azimuthal component of the residual velocity
of most OB-associations in the Sagittarius region precisely
constrains the solar position angle with respect to the bar
major axis, θb = 45 ± 5◦. We considered models with ana-
lytical bars and N-body simulations (Mel’nik & Rautiainen
2009; Rautiainen & Mel’nik 2010).

Models of a two-component outer ring are consistent
with the (l, VLSR) diagram by Dame, Hartmann & Thad-
deus (2001). These models can explain the position of the
Carina arm with respect to the Sun and with respect to the

bar. They can also explain the existence of some of the tan-
gential directions corresponding to the emission maxima
near the terminal velocity curves which, in this case, can be
associated with the tangents to the outer and inner rings. Our
model diagrams (l, VLSR) reproduce the maxima in the di-
rection of the Carina, Crux (Centaurus), Norma, and Sagit-
tarius arms. Additionally, N-body model yields maxima in
the directions of the Scutum and 3-kpc arms (Mel’nik &
Rautiainen 2011, 2013).

The elliptic outer rings can be divided into the ascending
and descending segments: in the ascending segments Galac-
tocentric distance R decreases with increasing azimuthal
angle θ, which itself increases in the direction of Galactic
rotation, whereas the dependence is reversed in the descend-
ing segments. Ascending and descending segments of the
rings can be regarded as fragments of trailing and leading
spiral arms, respectively. Note that if considered as frag-
ments of the spiral arms, the ascending segments of the
outer ring R2 have the pitch angle of ∼ 6◦ (Mel’nik &
Rautiainen 2011).

Two main classes of outer rings and pseudorings (in-
complete rings made up of two tightly wound spiral arms)
have been identiﬁed: rings R1 (pseudorings R′
1) elongated
perpendicular to the bar and rings R2 (pseudorings R′
2)
elongated parallel to the bar. In addition, there is a com-
bined morphological type R1R′
2 which exhibits elements
of both classes (Buta 1995; Buta & Combes 1996; Buta
& Crocker 1991; Comeron et al. 2013). Modelling shows
that outer rings are usually located near the OLR of the bar

(Schwarz 1981; Byrd et al. 1994; Rautiainen & Salo 1999,
2000; and other papers). However, the ring R1 can be lo-
cated further inwards, closer to the outer 4/1-resonance in
some cases (Treuthardt et al. 2008).

Buta and Combes (1996) have shown that for the galax-
ies in the lower red-shift range the frequency of the outer
rings is 10% of all types of spiral galaxies. However, it in-
creases to 20% for the early-type sample. Note, however,
that Comeron et al. (2014) obtained a larger frequency from
an analysis of the data from mid-infrared survey (Spitzer
Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies, Sheth at al. 2010):
16% for all spiral galaxies located inside 20 Mpc and over
40% for disk galaxies of early morphological types (galax-
ies with large bulges). They have also found that the fre-
quency of outer rings increases from 15 ± 2% to 32 ± 7%
when going through the family sequence from SA to SAB,
and decreases again to 20±2% for SB galaxies. The catalog
of Southern Ringed Galaxies by Buta (1995) gives the fol-
lowing statistics of the main ring classes: 18% (R1), 37%
(R′
2). Com-

1), under 1% (R2), 35% (R′

2), and 9% (R1R′

eron et al. (2014) generally conﬁrm these results: 35 ± 18%
of outer rings in barred galaxies are parallel to the bar and
65 ± 39% are oriented perpendicular to it. The small frac-
tion of galaxies with R1R′
2 rings may be due to the selection
effects – the rings R2 are often weaker than rings R1, more-
over rings R2 are often appear more conspicuous when ob-
served in the B-band. The completeness of the catalogs re-
garding the R2 features is difﬁcult to estimate. Generally,
the frequency of galaxies with outer rings R1R′
2 among
barred galaxies may be as high as few per cent. Note that
the catalog by Buta (1995) includes several tens of galaxies
with rings R1R′
2.

lar to each other. Of the two rings, R1 is located a bit
closer to the galactic center than the R2. Other examples
of galaxies with the R1R′
2 morphology that can also be
viewed as possible prototypes of the Galaxy are ESO 245-
1, NGC 1079, NGC 3081, NGC 5101, NGC 6782, and
NGC 7098. Their images can be found in de Vaucouleurs

Schwarz (1981) associates two main types of outer rings
with two main families of periodic orbits existing near the
OLR of the bar (Contopoulos & Papayannopoulos 1980).
The main periodic orbits x1(1) and x1(2) (in terms of the
nomenclature of Contopoulos & Grosbol 1989) are fol-
lowed by numerous chaotic orbits, and this guidance en-
ables elliptical rings to hold a lot of gas in their vicinity.
The rings R1 are supported by x1(2)-orbits lying inside the
OLR and elongated perpendicular to the bar while the rings
R2 are supported by x1(1)-orbits located slightly outside
the OLR and elongated along the bar. However, the role
of chaotic and periodic orbits appears to be different in the
center region and on the galactic periphery: chaos is domi-
nant outside the CR, while most orbits in the bar are ordered
(Contopoulos & Patsis 2006; Voglis, Harsoula & Contopou-
los 2007; Harsoula & Kalapotharakos 2009). Probably, it is
not only periodic orbits associated with the OLR that are re-
sponsible for the formation of the outer rings/pseudorings.
A concept has been proposed that the formation of outer
rings as well as that of spiral arms is determined by man-
ifolds associated with the Lagrangian points L1 and L2
(Romero-G´omez et al. 2007; Athanassoula et al. 2010).

The existence of the bar in the Galaxy is conﬁrmed
by numerous infra-red observations (Blitz & Spergel 1991;
Benjamin et al. 2005; Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2007; Church-
well et al. 2009, Gonz´alez-Fern´andez et al. 2012) and by
gas kinematics in the central region (Binney et al. 1991; En-
glmaier & Gerhard 1999; Weiner & Sellwood 1999). The
general consensus is that the major axis of the bar is ori-
ented in the direction θb = 15–45◦ in such a way that the
end of the bar closest to the Sun lies in quadrant I. The semi-
major axis of the Galactic bar is supposed to lie in the range
a = 3.5–5.0 kpc. Assuming that its end is located close
to its corotation radius, i.e. we are dealing with a so-called
fast bar (Debattista & Sellwood 2000), and that the rota-
tion curve is ﬂat, we can estimate the bar angular speed Ωb
which appears to be constrained to the interval Ωb = 40–65
km s−1 kpc−1. This means that the OLR of the bar is lo-
cated in the solar vicinity: |ROLR − R0| < 1.5 kpc. Studies
of the kinematics of old disk stars in the nearest solar neigh-
borhood, r < 250 pc, reveal the bimodal structure of the
distribution of (u, v) velocities which is also interpreted as a
result of the solar location near the OLR of the bar (Kalnajs
1991; Dehnen 2000; Fux 2001; and other papers).

In this paper we show that the morphological and kine-
matical features of the Cepheid sample considered are con-
sistent with the presence of a ring R1R′
2 in the Galaxy.
Section 2 describes the models and catalogues used; Sec-

tion 3 considers the special features in the distribution of
Cepheids; Section 4 studies the kinematics of Cepheids, and
Section 5 presents the main results and their discussion.

2 Models, catalogues, and calibrations

We used the catalogue of classical Cepheids by Berdnikov
et al. (2000) which is continuously improved and updated
by incorporating new observations (Berdnikov et al. 2009a,
2009b, 2011, 2014). The last version of the catalogue in-
cludes the data for 674 Cepheids (Berdnikov, Dambis &
Vozyakova 2014, in preparation). The procedure of deriv-
ing distances is based on the K-band period-luminosity re-
lation of Berdnikov, Vozyakova & Dambis (1996b) and
interstellar-extinction law derived in Berdnikov, Vozyakova
& Dambis (1996a). The interstellar-extinction values are
estimated using the B − V period-color relation of Dean,
Warren, and Cousins (1978). Note the natural spread of the
period-color relation does not introduce any substantial er-
rors in the inferred distance values because the K-band ex-
tinction is very small, AK = 0.274EB−V . Our procedure
in this case is essentially equivalent to using the V mλ We-
senheit function with the deviations from the mean period-
luminosity and period-color relations virtually cancelling
each other (Berdnikov et al. 1996a). Note the variations in
the distance scale up to 10% do not affect our conclusions.
We use the simulation code developed by H. Salo (Salo
1991; Salo & Laurikainen 2000) to construct two differ-
ent types of models (models with analytical bars and N-
body simulations) which reproduce the kinematics of OB-
associations in the Perseus and Sagittarius regions. Among
many models with outer rings, we chose model 3 from the
series of models with analytical bars (Mel’nik & Rautiainen
2009) for comparison with observations. This model has
nearly ﬂat rotation curve. The bar semi-axes are equal to
a = 4.0 kpc and b = 1.3 kpc. The positions and velocities
of 5 × 104 model particles (gas+OB) are considered at time
T = 15 (∼1 Gyr). We scaled and turned this model with re-
spect to the Sun to achieve the best agreement between the
velocities of model particles and those of OB-associations
in ﬁve stellar-gas complexes (Efremov & Sitnik 1988).

We adopt a solar Galactocentric distance of R0 = 7.5
kpc (Rastorguev et al. 1994; Dambis, Mel’nik & Rastorguev
1995; Glushkova et al. 1998; Nikiforov 2004; Feast et
al. 2008; Groenewegen, Udalski & Bono 2008; Reid et
al. 2009b; Dambis et al. 2013). As model 3 was adjusted
for R0 = 7.1 kpc, we rescaled all distances for model par-
ticles by a factor of k = 7.5/7.1. Note that the analysis of
morphology and kinematics of stars located within 3 kpc
from the Sun is practically independent of the choice of R0
in the range 7–9 kpc.

Table 1, which is available in the online version of the
paper, gives the positions, line-of-sight velocities and proper
motions of classical Cepheids. It ia also available at:

It includes 674 classical Cepheids from the new re-
lease of the catalog of classical Cepheids by Berdnikov et
al. (2014, in preparation). For every classical Cepheid we
give its designation in the General Catalog of Variable Stars
(GCVS) (Samus at al. 2007) or in the All Sky Automated
Survey (ASAS) (Pojmanski 2002), its type (see GCVS de-
scription), fundamental period PF , intensity-mean V-band
magnitude, J2000 equatorial coordinates α and δ, galac-
tic coordinates l and b, and heliocentric distance r. Ta-
ble 1 also gives the Cepheid line-of-sight velocities Vr (the
so-called γ-velocities, see Metzger, Caldwell & Schechter
1992), their uncertainties εV r and the references (1–6) to
the sources from which they are taken. The proper motions
of Cepheids were adopted from the new reduction of Hip-
parcos data (ESA 1997) by van Leeuwen (2007). Table 1
presents proper motions µα and µδ, their uncertainties εµα
and εµδ and the corresponding Hipparcos catalog number
nHip.

Table 2 lists the catalogs of line-of-sight velocities used
in our study. For each catalog it gives the corresponding
reference number used in Table 1, the authors of the cata-
log, the full reference to the paper/catalog, and the number
of velocities taken from each source. Some sources include
a series of papers by one group of researches and/or data
available only online.

3 Morphological evidence

3.1 Distribution in the Galactic plane

The distribution of Cepheids in the Galactic plane can re-
veal regions of high gas density which can be associated
with spiral arms or Galactic rings. Figure 2 shows the dis-
tributions of classical Cepheids and model particles. We can
notice two speciﬁc features here. First, the distribution of
Cepheids is reminiscent of ”a tuning fork”: at longitudes
l > 180◦ there is only one spiral arm (the Carina arm) to-
ward which Cepheids concentrate strongly while at longi-
tudes l < 180◦ there are two regions with high surface den-
sity located near the Perseus and Sagittarius regions. Sec-
ond, the concentration of Cepheids drops sharply in the di-
rection to the Galactic center while it decreases more grad-
ually in other directions. These features will be studied fur-
ther.

We also provide Figure 3 to emphasize the fork-
like structure in the distribution of Cepheids. Positions of
Cepheids are represented in coordinates (θ, ∆R), where θ
is the Galactocentric angle and ∆R = R − R0 is the differ-
ence between the Galactocentric distances of a Cepheid and
the Sun. Cepheids can be seen to concentrate to the Carina
arm at the negative angles θ and to the Perseus and Sagittar-
ius regions at the positive θ.

The position of two outer rings in the distribution of
model particles can be approximated by two ellipses ori-
ented perpendicular to each other. The outer ring R1 can be
represented by the ellipse with the semi-axes a1 = 6.3 and

b1 = 5.8 kpc, while the outer ring R2 ﬁts well the ellipse
with a2 = 8.5 and b2 = 7.6 kpc. These values correspond
to the solar Galactocentric distance R0 = 7.5 kpc. The ring
R1 is stretched perpendicular to the bar and the ring R2 is
aligned with the bar, hence the position of the Sun and that
of the sample of Cepheids with respect to the rings is deter-
mined by the Galactocentric angle θb of the Sun with respect
to the major axis of the bar. We now assume that Cepheids
concentrate to the outer rings to ﬁnd the optimum angle θb
providing the best agreement between the position of the
rings and the distribution of Cepheids.

Figure 4 shows three χ2 functions – the sum of normal-
ized squared deviations of Cepheids from the outer rings
(Press et al. 1987) – calculated for different values of the
angle θb. For each star we determined the minimum dis-
tances to the two ellipses and then took the smallest of the
two values. However, the χ2 function appears to be very
sensitive to the completeness of the sample. This problem
will be studied further. Here we show the results obtained
for three distance-limited Cepheid samples including stars
located within rmax = 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 kpc from the Sun.
Table 3 lists the parameters of different samples: the num-
ber N of Cepheids, the minimal value χ2
min, the standard
deviation σ0 of a Cepheid from the model distribution, and
the angle θb corresponding to χ2
min. In this section we con-
sider the parameters derived without any segregation over
periods, deferring the discussion of the values obtained for
short- and long-period Cepheids separately to section 3.2.
The ﬁrst three rows of Table 3 indicate that the χ2 functions
reach their minima at θb = 50◦, 37◦, and 25◦, respectively.
The random errors of these estimates are of about ±5◦. Note
that the different values of χ2
min represented in Table 3 are
derived for different samples and cannot be compared with
each other. This also holds true for the values of σ0.

The position angle estimates θb = 50 ± 5◦ and 37 ± 5◦
derived for the samples within rmax = 2.5 and 3.0 kpc,
respectively, agree well with the estimate θb = 45 ± 5◦
obtained from the kinematics of OB-associations (Mel’nik
& Rautiainen 2009; Rautiainen & Mel’nik 2010). It must be
”the fork-shaped” distribution of Cepheids that determines
the angle θb being close to 45◦. At longitudes l > 180◦ two
outer rings fuse together to form one spiral fragment – the
Carina arm, whereas at longitudes l < 180◦ two outer rings
are prominent, generating the fragments of the Sagittarius
and Perseus arms.

We can see that the estimates of θb decrease with in-
creasing rmax (Table 3). This shift can be attributed to nu-
merous stars scattered in the direction of the anti-center at
distances r > 2 kpc (Figures 2,3). Their inclusion into the
sample makes the outer ring R2 to be aligned with the line
connecting the Sun and the Galactic center. As the ring R2
is aligned with the bar, the increase of rmax must be accom-
panied by the decrease in θb.

On the whole, the optimum position angle θb providing
the best agreement between the distribution of Cepheids in-
side 3 ± 0.5 kpc and the model of the outer ring R1R′

3.2 Distribution over periods

There is a wide-spread opinion that only classical Cepheids
with long periods are suitable for study of the Galactic struc-
ture. Note that Cepheids with the periods P < 4 days ac-
tually require more thorough study for classiﬁcation. First,
some of them are oscillating in the ﬁrst overtone rather than
in the fundamental tone and this fact should be taken into ac-

count when computing the distances. Second, short-period
classical Cepheids can be confused with W Vir type vari-
ables which are old stars of population II. However, clas-
sical Cepheids have very speciﬁc features in light curves
(Hertzsprung Progression) (Hertzsprung, 1926) which dis-
tinguish them from Cepheids of other types.

The subdivision of Cepheids into long- and short-period
groups is a matter of convention. Usually, they are sepa-
rated by the period of 10 days. However, we believe that the
value of 8 days is more appropriate. Figure 5 shows the dis-
tribution of fundamental periods of Cepheids. We can see a
clear maximum in the distribution of Cepheids with periods
P < 8 days and almost a plateau distribution for Cepheids
with P > 8.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of classical Cepheids
with short (P < 8 d) and long (P > 8 d) periods in the
Galactic plane. It shows a conspicuous lack of long-period
Cepheids in quadrant III. However, short- and long-period
Cepheids generally show a similar behavior: they concen-
trate to the Carina arm in quadrant IV, to the Sagittarius re-
gion in quadrant I, and to the Perseus region in quadrant II.
We repeat our study of the χ2 functions for short- and
long-period Cepheids separately. Table 3 presents the pa-
rameters derived for Cepheids with periods P < 8 and
P > 8 days in three regions: rmax = 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5
kpc. We can see that the angles θb corresponding to χ2
min
derived for the short- and long-period Cepheids in the same
regions coincide within the errors. On the whole, short- and
long-period Cepheids demonstrate the same tendency.

3.3 Average surface density and extinction in different
directions

The average surface density and interstellar extinction of
Cepheids in different directions can provide us with addi-
tional information about the distribution of gas and dust in
the Galaxy. To study these characteristics, we subdivide the
sample of Cepheids into four sectors: the directions to the
center |l| < 45◦ and anti-center |l−180| < 45◦, those in the
sense of Galactic rotation |l − 90| < 45◦ and in the opposite
sense |l−270| < 45◦. For each sector we calculate the num-
ber of Cepheids in annuli of width ∆r = 1 kpc. The ratio of
the number of Cepheids in a quarter of an annulus to its area
gives us the average surface density n of Cepheids per kpc2.
This value depends on the sector and heliocentric distance
r. We also calculate the average V -band extinction AV for
Cepheids in different annuli and in different sectors. We
compute the AV value for each star as AV = 3.26EB−V
(Berdnikov et al. 1996a), where EB−V is the color excess
from the catalog by Berdnikov et al. (2000). Note that the
values of AV were not used in the determination of Cepheid
distances which were derived from the K-band magnitudes
and extinction AK (see also section 2).

Figure 7 (a) and (b) shows the variations of n(r) and
AV (r) along the heliocentric distance r calculated for the
four sectors. The surface density of Cepheids n in the direc-
tion of the center (|l| < 45◦) can be seen to drop sharply
with increasing r: it decreases by a factor of ∼ 10 from
the distance range of 0–1 kpc to that of 2–3 kpc. For com-
parison, this ratio amounts only 1.3–1.9 for the other three
sectors. The surface density of Cepheids in the direction of
the anti-center |l − 180| < 45◦ is less than in other direc-
tions within 4 kpc, for larger distances the estimates of n are

very uncertain. Extinction AV can also be seen to increase
sharply toward the Galactic center (|l| < 45◦).

Additionally, we consider the variations in the number
of Cepheids N and AV along the apparent distance mod-
ulus m − M (Figure 7cd), where N and the average ex-
tinction AV are calculated in 2m-wide distance modulus
bins. The distribution of N for the sector |l| < 45◦ peaks
at 13m, whereas those for the other sectors peak at 15m.
It means that Cepheids can generally be discovered out to
m − M = 15m with the current instruments. Probably,
the number of Cepheids N in the sector |l| < 45◦ drops
considerably beyond 13m due to their lower surface density
there. However, the alternative explanation is that crowd-

ing is much stronger in the direction of the Galactic center
|l| < 45◦, preventing the discovery of Cepheids. Possibly,
the survey VISTA variables in the Via Lactea (Saito et al.
2012) would help solve this alternative.

The bars in Figure 7 (b) and (d) indicate the errors in
extinction AV which are shown only for the direction of the
Galactic center |l| < 45◦ and anti-center |l − 180| < 45◦. In
other sectors, the errors of AV are less than 0.2m. We can
see that extinction AV in the direction of the Galactic center
|l| < 45◦ is greater than in other directions. Particularly, for
distance moduli m−M > 11m (r > 1.5 kpc), the extinction
AV in the direction |l| < 45◦ is greater than in the opposite
direction |l − 180| < 45◦ at a signiﬁcance level of P > 2σ.

respect of P = 8 days. Roman numbers indicate quadrants. We
can see the conspicuous lack of long-period Cepheids in quadrant
III.

Generally, these particularities can be explained in terms
of the model of the Galaxy with the outer rings located near
the Sun. It is probable that the line of sight directed toward
the Galactic center intersects the outer ring R1 (Figure 2)
which may contain a great amount of dust. Note that N-body
simulations show that the ring R1 forms not only in the gas
subsystem but also in the stellar component (Rautiainen &
Salo 2000). We can expect that a high concentration of old
stars in the ring R1 can be accompanied by a great amounts
of dust there.

sense opposite that of Galactic rotation |l−270| < 45◦ (Fig-
ures 7a). The latter result may be due to the great interest of
observers in the Carina arm and its extension.

Another criterion of the completeness of the sample can
be formulated on the basis of variations in the number of
Cepheids N along the visual distance modulus m−M (Fig-
ure 7b). Suppose that the sample is complete until the num-
ber of Cepheid N increases with increasing m−M . This es-
tablishes the limits of m−M = 13m for the sector in the di-
rection of the Galactic center (|l| < 45◦) and m−M = 15m
for the three other sectors. To transform these apparent dis-
tance moduli into distances, we must make an assump-
tion about extinction. The variation of AV with distance
modulus (Figure 7d) shows that the average extinction at
m − M = 13m in the sector (|l| < 45◦) is nearly 2.0m and
it is also close to AV = 2.0m at m − M = 15m in three
other sectors. So we can suppose that a Cepheid will be dis-
covered if its true distance modulus is (m − M )0 = 11.0m
in the sector (|l| < 45◦) and (m − M )0 = 13.0m in other
sectors, i.e if it is located within r = 1.6 kpc and r = 4.0
kpc, respectively which is consistent with our previous esti-
mates.

Let us consider another criterion of completeness which
is based on the distribution of apparent magnitudes (Szaba-
dos 2003, for example). Figure 9 shows the distribution of
apparent visual magnitudes mv of Cepheids from the cat-
alog by Berdnikov et al. (2000). The number of Cepheids
can be seen to increase with mv till the value 12m. Note
that the average apparent magnitudes mv of Cepheids in the
heliocentric distance intervals 2–3 and 3–4 kpc are 11 and
12m, respectively. So again we can suppose that the catalog
by Berdnikov et al. (2000) is nearly complete till ∼ 3 kpc.
To formulate more precisely, the incompleteness is getting
obvious at r > 3 kpc.

4 Kinematical evidence

4.1 Rotation curve

3.4 Completeness of the sample

To estimate the radius of completeness of our sample,
we need a hypothesis about the physical distribution of
Cepheids. On the one hand, Cepheids should not be dis-
tributed uniformly in the Galactic disk, they must concen-
trate to spiral arms or to Galactic rings. On the other hand,
Cepheids at larger distances are less likely to be discovered
than those situated close to the Sun. Let us suppose that spi-
ral arms or outer rings can increase the surface density of
Cepheids not more than by a factor of two. That gives us
a simple criterion: the sample is complete until the surface
density n(r) drops not more than to half its maximum value.
When applied to the four sectors this criterion suggests that
our sample is complete out to 2 kpc in the direction of the
Galactic center (|l| < 45◦), out to 3 kpc in two directions:
that of the anti-center |l − 180| < 45◦ and in the sense of
Galactic rotation |l − 90| < 45◦, and out to ∼ 4 kpc in the

Before studying the non-circular motions, we must deter-
mine the main parameters of the circular rotation of our ob-
jects. Using the rotation curve derived from the same sample
of objects allows us to avoid systematical effects due to the
eventual inconsistency of the distance scales of two differ-
ent samples.

We determine the parameters of the rotation curve based
only on the Cepheids located within 3.5 kpc from the Sun
(r < 3.5 kpc) and within 0.5 kpc (|z| < 0.5 kpc) from the
Galactic plane. This subsample includes 257 Cepheids with
available accurate line-of-sight velocities and 217 Cepheids
with Hipparcos proper motions. The approach we use to
solve the Bottlinger equations was described in detail in our
earlier papers (Dambis et al. 1995; Mel’nik, Dambis & Ras-
torguev 1999; Mel’nik & Dambis 2009), so we do not re-
peat it here. We list the inferred parameters of the rotation
curve and solar motion in Table 4, where Ω0 is the angu-
lar rotation velocity Ω(R) at R = R0; Ω′

centroid of the sample in the direction toward the Galactic
center and Galactic rotation, respectively; N is the number
of conditional equations. Table 4 also includes the parame-
ters derived for short- and long-period Cepheids separately
and those for OB-associations.

Figure 8 (top panel) shows the rotation curve derived
from an analysis of the line-of-sight velocities and proper
motions of Cepheids of all periods. For comparison, we
also show the rotation curve based on the data for OB-
associations (Mel’nik & Dambis 2009). The parameters of
the rotation curve derived for Cepheids and OB-associations
agree within their errors, see Table 4. Our Cepheid sample
yields Ω0 = 28.8 ± 0.8 km s−1 kpc−1 which is also con-
sistent with other studies of the Cepheid kinematics: Ω0 =
27.2 ± 0.9 (Feast & Whitelock 1997) and Ω0 = 27.5 ± 0.5
(Bobylev & Baikova 2012). However, there is a systematical
difference between the value of Ω0 obtained for Cepheids
and that inferred for OB-associations and maser sources,
Ω0 = 31 ± 1 km s−1 (Reid et al. 2009a, Mel’nik & Dambis
2009; Bobylev & Baikova 2010). The linear rotation ve-
locity at the solar Galactocentric distance estimated from
the kinematics of Cepheids is systematically lower than the
value derived from OB-associations. Moreover, the rotation
curve of Cepheids seems to be slightly descending, whereas
that of OB-associations is nearly ﬂat within the 3 kpc neigh-
borhood of the Sun. We are inclined to attribute these dif-
ferences to the fact that the distances and proper motions
available for Cepheids are less accurate than those of OB-
associations. Averaging the distances and proper motions of
stars within each OB-association may have given a consid-
erable advantage. This problem requires further study.

The lower panel of Figure 8 shows the scatter of indi-
vidual azimuthal velocities of Cepheids with respect to the
rotation curve. The standard deviation of the projected ve-
locities onto the Galactic plane from the rotation curve is
σ0 = 10.8 km s−1 for Cepheids of all periods.

We also calculated the parameters of the rotation curve
for short- and long-period Cepheids (Table 4). It can be

seen that parameters determined for Cepheids with P < 8
and P > 8 days are consistent within the errors except
for Ω0, which is conspicuously smaller for long-period
Cepheids. Note that the standard deviation of the velocities
from the rotation curve equals σ0 = 11.19 and 10.04 km
s−1 for short- and long-period Cepheids, respectively. The
small difference between them suggests that both groups of
Cepheids are suitable for study the Galactic structure.

4.2 Residual velocities of Cepheids and model
particles

Residual velocities characterize non-circular motions in
the Galactic disk. We calculate the residual velocities for
Cepheids as the differences between the observed heliocen-
tric velocities and the computed velocities due to the cir-
cular rotation law and the adopted components of the so-
lar motion deﬁned by the parameters listed in Table 4 (ﬁrst
row). For model particles the residual velocities are deter-
mined with respect to the model rotation curve. We con-
sider the residual velocities in the radial VR and azimuthal
VT directions. Positive radial residual velocities VR are di-
rected away from the Galactic center while positive az-
imuthal residual velocities VT are in the sense of Galactic
rotation.

Figure 10 shows the distribution of model particles with
negative and positive residual velocities VR and VT located
within 3.5 kpc from the Sun. The left panel demonstrates
the distribution of radial residual velocities VR. Model par-
ticles in the outer ring R1 (the one which is closer to the
Galactic center) have positive velocities VR (black circles),
whereas those in the ring R2 have negative velocities VR
(gray circles). Particles located at the Galactic periphery
(R > R0 + 2 kpc) have close to zero velocities VR (black
points). The right panel shows the distribution of azimuthal
velocity VT . Model particles in the ring R1 lying left of the
Sagittarius complex (l ≈ 15◦, r ≈ 1.5 kpc) have mostly
negative VT velocities while those situated right of it have
mostly positive VT velocities. It is not a chance coincidence
because the position angle of the bar θb was chosen in such
a way that model particles reproduce nearly zero velocities
VT of OB-associations in the Sagittarius complex (Mel’nik
& Rautiainen 2009). In the ring R2 we see the opposite ve-

locity gradient: model particles located at the negative x-
coordinates have mostly positive VT velocities (black cir-
cles), whereas those situated at the positive x-coordinates
have mainly negative VT velocities (gray circles).

Let us consider the distribution of Cepheids and model
particles with negative (VR < 0) and positive (VR > 0)
radial residual velocities (Figure 11). The left panel shows
the distribution of objects with negative radial velocities VR
which are supposed to belong to the outer ring R2. Within
r < 3.0 kpc from the Sun, the elliptic ring R2 can be rep-
resented as a fragment of the spiral arm. Its pitch angle ap-
pears to be i = 8.3 ± 3.9◦ and i = 6.0 ± 0.5◦ for Cepheids
and model particles, respectively. The positive value of the
pitch angle i indicates that the spiral arm is leading and cor-
responds to the solar position near the descending segment
of the outer ring R2. Since the ring R2 is aligned with the
bar, the location of the Sun near the descending segment of
the outer ring R2 reﬂects the well-known fact that the bar’s
end closest to the Sun lies in quadrant I.

Figure 11 (right panel) shows Cepheids and model parti-
cles with positive radial residual velocities (VR > 0). These
objects are expected to concentrate to the ascending seg-
ment of the outer ring R1. Unfortunately, we see no good
agreement here. However, Cepheids do not occupy all the
3-kpc solar neighborhood, they as well as model particles
with VR > 0 are mostly located at negative y-coordinates.
Figure 12 shows the dependence of azimuthal velocity
VT on coordinate x for Cepheids and model particles with
negative radial velocities (VR < 0). The objects studied are
located within 3 kpc of the Sun and are supposed to belong
to the descending segment of the outer ring R2. We consider
only Cepheids with small errors (εvl < 10 km s−1) of the
tangential velocity in the Galactic plane Vl. The value of 10
km s−1 corresponds to the average deviation of the Cepheid
velocity from rotation curve (σ0 in Table 4). The error εvl is
determined by the error of the proper motion in the Galactic
plane µl and the distance r, εvl = 4.74rεµl, where proper
motion is in mas yr−1 and the distance is in kpc. We use
the linear law to describe the VT -x relation: VT = ax + b.
The slope a for Cepheids and model particles appears to be
a = −2.0 ± 0.8 and a = −3.3 ± 0.1, respectively. Both
values of a are negative, and this trend for Cepheids has a
signiﬁcance level of P > 2σ.

Generally,

the kinematical

features obtained for
Cepheids with negative radial velocities VR are consistent
with the solar location near the descending segment of the
outer ring R2.

positive (VR > +3 km s−1) and close to zero (|VR| < 3 km s−1). The same was done for the azimuthal velocities VT . The solar position
angle θb for model particles is chosen to be θb = 45◦. The arrows show the locations of the fragments of the outer rings R1 and R2: the
ring R1 is closer to the center than the ring R2. The X-axis is directed in the sense of the Galactic rotation, the Y -axis is directed away
from the Galactic center. The Sun is in the origin. One tick interval along the X- and Y -axis corresponds to 1 kpc.

Fig. 11 Distribution of Cepheids (black circles) and model particles (gray circles) with negative (VR < 0) and positive (VR > 0)
radial residual velocities in the Galactic plane. Left: objects with VR < 0 are supposed to belong to the descending segment of the outer
ring R2. Right: objects with the positive radial residual velocities (VR > 0) are mostly located in quadrants I and IV. The X-axis is
directed in the sense of the Galactic rotation, the Y -axis is directed away from the Galactic center. The Sun is at the origin. One tick
interval along the X- and Y -axis corresponds to 1 kpc.

Fig. 12 Dependence of azimuthal velocity VT on coordinate x
for the Cepheids (black circles) and model particles (gray circles)
with negative radial residual velocities (VR < 0). These objects
are supposed to belong to the descending segment of the outer ring
R2. Both Cepheids and model particles demonstrate a decrease in
VT with increasing x.

ring R1R′
2 is obtained if the position angle of the Sun with
respect to the bar major axis is θb = 50 ± 5◦, 37 ± 5◦, and
25 ± 5◦, respectively. Averaging these values gives the ﬁnal
estimate of θb = 37 ± 13◦. It is ”the fork-like” structure
in the distribution of Cepheids that determines the angle θb
being close to 45◦: at longitudes l > 180◦ two outer rings
fuse together to form one spiral fragment – the Carina arm,
whereas at longitudes l < 180◦ two outer rings run sepa-
rately producing the Sagittarius and Perseus arm-fragments.

To study the surface density n and extinction AV of
Cepheids in different directions, we subdivide the sample
into four sectors and calculate the average values of n and
AV at different heliocentric distances r. The surface den-
sity n of Cepheids appears to drop sharply in the direction
of the Galactic center (|l| < 45◦). Furthermore, extinction
AV grows most rapidly just in this direction. These features
can be due to the presence of the ring R1 located in the di-
rection of the Galactic center at 1–2 kpc from the Sun.

Our analysis of variations in the surface density of
Cepheids along distance gives us the estimate of the com-
pleteness radius of the sample which appears to lie in the
2-4 kpc interval for the different sectors. A similar result
was obtained from an analysis of distance moduli and vi-
sual magnitudes. We adopt 3 ± 1 kpc as the average value.
Probably, within 3 kpc from the Sun, the apparent distribu-
tion of known Cepheids reﬂects their physical distribution
rather than instrumental-related difﬁculties in their discov-
ery and study.

The parameters of the rotation curve derived from
the samples of Cepheids and OB-associations (Mel’nik &
Dambis 2009) are consistent within the errors (Table 4).

We study the distribution of Cepheids and model par-
ticles with negative radial residual velocities (VR < 0),
which inside 3 kpc of the Sun must belong to the outer
ring R2. The selected Cepheids and model particles demon-
strate similar distribution in the Galactic plane: both sam-
ples concentrate to the fragment of the leading spiral arm
with the pitch angle of i = 8.3 ± 3.9◦ and i = 6.0 ± 0.5◦,
respectively. A similar leading fragment was found in the
distribution of OB-associations with negative radial resid-
ual velocities (VR < 0) (Mel’nik 2005). The appearance of
the leading fragment suggests that the Sun is located near
the descending segment of the ring R2. Moreover, selected
Cepheids and model particles exhibit similar variations of
azimuthal velocity VT in the direction of Galactic rotation
(the x coordinate).

All this morphological and kinematical evidence sug-
gests the existence of a ring R1R′
2 in the Galaxy. N-body
simulations show that the descending segments of the outer
rings R2 often include clumps and spurs (Rautiainen & Salo
2000). Probably, the Galactic outer ring R2 is not homo-
geneous in the solar neighborhood. The local Cygnus arm
(l = 70–80◦, r = 1–2 kpc) and the observed fragment of
the Perseus arm (l = 100–140◦, r = 1.5–3.0 kpc) can be
associated with some of these model spurs. Such spurs usu-
ally have a larger pitch angle than large-scale patterns like
segments of elliptical rings or global spiral arms. The nature
of the fragmentation is not clear, it can be of purely hydro-
dynamical origin (Dobbs & Bonnell 2006) or be associated
with slow modes forming in the stellar population of the
disk (Rautiainen & Salo 1999, 2000).
