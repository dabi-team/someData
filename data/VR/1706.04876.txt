METRIC RECONSTRUCTION VIA OPTIMAL TRANSPORT

MICHA L ADAMASZEK, HENRY ADAMS, AND FLORIAN FRICK

m

Abstract. Given a sample of points X in a metric space M and a scale r > 0, the Vietoris–Rips
simplicial complex VR(X; r) is a standard construction to attempt to recover M from X up to
homotopy type. A deﬁciency of this approach is that VR(X; r) is not metrizable if it is not lo-
cally ﬁnite, and thus does not recover metric information about M . We attempt to remedy this
shortcoming by deﬁning a metric space thickening of X, which we call the Vietoris–Rips thicken-
(X; r), via the theory of optimal transport. When M is a complete Riemannian manifold,
ing VR
or alternatively a compact Hadamard space, we show that the the Vietoris–Rips thickening satisﬁes
Hausmann’s theorem (VRm(M ; r) ≃ M for r suﬃciently small) with a simpler proof: homotopy
(M ; r) → M is canonically deﬁned as a center of mass map, and its homotopy
equivalence VR
inverse is the (now continuous) inclusion map M ֒→ VRm(M ; r). Furthermore, we describe the
homotopy type of the Vietoris–Rips thickening of the n-sphere at the ﬁrst positive scale parameter
r where the homotopy type changes.

1. Introduction

Let X be a set of points sampled from a metric space M ; the only information we retain about M is its
metric restricted to X × X. In general it is impossible to reconstruct the homotopy type of M from this
data, even if the set X is suﬃciently dense (say an ε-net). A remarkable theorem of Latschev [25] states that
if M is a closed Riemannian manifold and X is suﬃciently close to M in the Gromov–Hausdorﬀ distance,
then one can recover the homotopy type of M . Indeed, consider the Vietoris–Rips complex VR(X; r), which
has as its simplices the ﬁnite subsets of X of diameter less than r > 0. Latschev proves that for certain small
values of r, complex VR(X; r) is homotopy equivalent to M . The Vietoris–Rips complex was introduced
independently by Vietoris who deﬁned a homology theory for compact metric spaces ([41] and [26, VII
§5]), and by Rips who showed that torsion-free hyperbolic groups have ﬁnite Eilenberg–MacLane spaces [5,
Theorem III 3.21].

More recently, Vietoris–Rips complexes have been a commonly used tool in computational topology and
persistent homology [16].
If M is a manifold, what properties of M can one recover when given only a
ﬁnite data set X noisily sampled from M ? Latschev’s theorem motivates the construction of the Vietoris–
Rips complex VR(X; r) as a proxy for the homotopy type of M , but unfortunately one does not know
how to choose r appropriately without knowledge of the (unknown) curvature of M . In practice, computa-
tional topologists instead let the scale r vary from small to large, and compute the persistent homology of
VR(X; r) (i.e. the homology of VR(X; r) as r changes) to get a multiresolution summary of the data. The
topological perspective has aided the analysis of data arising from image processing [9], conformation spaces

introductions to persistent homology include [8] and [18].

Though we started with a metric space X, the Vietoris–Rips complex VR(X; r) does not come equipped
with a natural choice of metric. Indeed, VR(X; r) is not metrizable if it is not locally ﬁnite, meaning it is
impossible to equip VR(X; r) with a metric without changing the homeomorphism type. We use optimal
transport to build a family of metric spaces VRm(X; r) – the Vietoris–Rips thickenings – from the knowledge
of pairwise distances in X. In these metric spaces we can take abstract convex combinations of points in
If VR(X; r) is not
X whenever they are at distance less than r from one another, just as in VR(X; r).
locally ﬁnite then necessarily VRm(X; r) has a diﬀerent (metrizable) topology. Furthermore, if M is a
closed Riemannian manifold and X is Gromov–Hausdorﬀ close to M , then VRm(X; r) is not only homotopy
equivalent to M (for appropriate small r), but also Gromov–Hausdorﬀ close to M (Lemma 3.6). We prove
the following (see Lemma 3.6, Corollary 6.4, Property 6.6, Theorem 4.2):

Main Theorem. Let X be a metric space and r > 0.

(1) Metric space VRm(X; r) is an r-thickening of X; in particular the Gromov–Hausdorﬀ distance be-

tween X and VRm(X; r) is at most r.

(2) If VR(X; r) is locally ﬁnite, then VRm(X; r) is homeomorphic to VR(X; r).
(3) If X is discrete, then VRm(X; r) is homotopy equivalent to VR(X; r).
(4) If M is a complete Riemannian manifold with curvature bounded from above and below, then VRm(M ; r)

is homotopy equivalent to M for r suﬃciently small.

In the restricted setting where X is discrete, item (1) is stated by Gromov [19, 1.B(c)]. Similar properties
are discussed when X is a length space (and VRm(X; r) is called a polyhedral regularization of X) by
Burago, Burago, Ivanov in [7, Example 3.2.9]. The proof of Item (3) relies on the nerve lemma, and a
much more general statement is given in Remark 6.5. Item (4) is an analogue of Hausmann’s theorem [21,
Theorem 3.5] for Vietoris–Rips thickenings, and holds also for compact Hadamard spaces (Remark 4.3).
Whereas Hausmann’s homotopy equivalence VR(M ; r) → M relies on the choice of a total ordering of all
points in M , our homotopy equivalence VRm(M ; r) → M is now canonically deﬁned using Karcher or Fr´echet
means. Furthermore, the homotopy inverse of our map is the (now continuous) inclusion M ֒→ VRm(M ; r).
We prove that the compositions are homotopy equivalent to the corresponding identity maps by using linear
homotopies.

Motivation. We provide the following motivation for our work. In applications of topology to data [8], one
is given a sampling of points X from an unknown underlying space M and would like to use X to recover
information of M . There are a variety of theoretical guarantees [2, 4, 12, 25, 32] showing how Vietoris–
Rips complexes and related constructions built on a suﬃciently dense sampling X can be used to recover
information such as the homology groups and homotopy types of M . However, since M is unknown one does
not know if the assumptions needed for these results (such as having the Vietoris–Rips scale r be suﬃciently
small depending on the curvature of M ) are satisﬁed. In practical applications, one often allows the scale r
to vary from small to large and computes the persistent homology of VR(X; r). This is reasonable because
as X converges to M in the Gromov–Hausdorﬀ distance, the persistent homology of VR(X; r) converges
to that of VR(M ; r) [11]. However, very little is known about the limiting object, the persistent homology
of VR(M ; r), even when M is a manifold. Indeed, to our knowledge the only connected non-contractible
manifold M for which the persistent homology of VR(M ; r) is known at all scales r is the circle [1].1 When

1And easy consequences thereof, such as when manifold M is an annulus or torus with a particular metric [1, Section 10].
2

M is an inﬁnite metric space, we believe that the metric thickening VRm(M ; r) is in several ways a more
natural object than the simplicial complex VR(M ; r). As evidence for this claim, in Section 5 we describe
the ﬁrst new homotopy type of Vietoris–Rips thickenings VRm(Sn; r) of higher-dimensional spheres as scale
r increases. We conjecture (Conjecture 6.12) that these homotopy types are closely related to the (unknown)
homotopy types of Vietoris–Rips complexes VR(Sn; r) of higher-dimensional spheres, which determine what
the persistent homology of a dataset X will converge to when X is a denser and denser sampling of a sphere.
We would like to clarify the relationship between using either the Vietoris–Rips complex VR(X; r) or the
Vietoris–Rips thickening VRm(X; r) in applications of topology to data analysis. For X ﬁnite, the persistent
homology barcodes for VR(X; r) and for VRm(X; r) coincide (Corollary 6.10). It is known that for X inﬁnite,
the persistent homology intervals for VR(X; r) and VRm(X; r) can diﬀer at endpoints (open endpoints versus
closed endpoints, or vice-versa; see Remark 6.11). It is not known whether the two persistent homology
intervals are identical after ignoring endpoints, although we conjecture this to be the case (Conjecture 6.12).2
When X is inﬁnite, it is diﬃcult to determine the persistent homology of either VR(X; r) or VRm(X; r). A
disadvantage of the thickening is that Latschev’s theorem ([25]) is known only for X ﬁnite (Corollary 6.8),
although it is conjectured also for X arbitrary (Conjecture 6.9). A second disadvantage of the thickening is
that the stability of persistent homology ([11, Theorem 5.2]) is known only for X and Y ﬁnite (Corollary 6.13),
although it is conjectured also for X and Y arbitrary (Conjecture 6.14). Advantages of the thickening over the
complex are that the thickening is always a metric space, the proof of Hausmann’s theorem is more natural,
Hausmann’s theorem extends also to compact Hadamard spaces and to Euclidean submanifolds [3], there
are example spaces whose Vietoris–Rips complexes have uncountable homology but whose thickenings have
ﬁnite homology (Appendix C), and furthermore we are able to determine the homotopy types of Vietoris–
Rips thickenings of higher-dimensional spheres at larger scale parameters (Theorem 5.4). It is not yet clear
whether VR(X; r) or VRm(X; r) should be the primary object of study (despite our preferences for the
latter), but understanding either space improves one’s understanding of the other.

Organization. In Section 2 we introduce our primary tool, the Wasserstein or Kantorovich metric on
Radon measures of an arbitrary metric space; see Edwards and Kellerer [17, 23, 24]. We deﬁne Vietoris–
Rips thickenings in Section 3 and give some of their basic properties. Section 4 proves metric analogues of
Hausmann’s theorem and the nerve lemma. In Section 5 we leverage this new metric viewpoint to determine
the homotopy types of VRm(Sn; r), for all spheres Sn, at the ﬁrst positive scale parameter r where the
homotopy type changes. In Section 6 we study maps between simplicial complexes and thickenings, including
metric analogues of Latschev’s theorem and the stability of persistent homology.

Ivan Marin in [29] studies related constructions which produce geometric classifying spaces for a topological

group that is furthermore metrizable.

2. Preliminaries

Topological spaces. We write Y ≃ Z for homotopy equivalent topological spaces Y and Z. Given a
topological space Y and a subset Z ⊆ Y , let Z denote the closure of Z in Y . We denote the n-dimensional
sphere by Sn and the closed n-dimensional ball by Dn. Given a topological space Y , let C(Y ) be its cone—for
example C(Sn) = Dn+1. Furthermore, let Σ Y be the suspension of Y , and let Σi Y be the i-fold suspension
of Y . The join of two topological spaces Y and Z is denoted Y ∗ Z.

2And in the unexpected event that the persistent homology intervals for VR(X; r) and VRm(X; r) can diﬀer drastically,

then it is not clear which one should be the primary object of interest.

Metric spaces. Given a metric space (X, d), a point x ∈ X, and a real number r ≥ 0, we let BX (x, r) =
{y ∈ X | d(y, x) < r} (or B(x, r) when the ambient space X is clear from context) denote the open ball of
radius r about x. We let dGH(X, Y ) denote the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ distance between metric spaces X and
Y .

An r-thickening of a metric space X, as deﬁned in [19, 1.B], is a larger metric space Z ⊇ X such that

• the distance function on Z extends that on X, and
• d(z, X) ≤ r for all z ∈ Z.

If Z is an r-thickening of X it follows that dGH(X, Z) ≤ r.

Simplicial complexes. Let K be a simplicial complex; we do not notationally distinguish between an
If
abstract simplicial complex and its geometric realization. We let V (K) denote the vertex set of K.
V ′ ⊆ V (K), then we let K[V ′] denote the induced simplicial complex on vertex set V ′.

Vietoris–Rips and ˇCech complexes. Let X be a metric space and let r ≥ 0. The Vietoris–Rips sim-
plicial complex VR<(X; r) (resp. VR≤(X; r)) has X as its vertex set, and {x0, . . . , xk} ⊆ X as a simplex
whenever diam({x0, . . . , xk}) < r (resp. diam({x0, . . . , xk}) ≤ r). The ˇCech simplicial complex ˇC<(X; r)
k
(resp. ˇC≤(X; r)) has X as its vertex set, and {x0, . . . , xk} ⊆ X as a simplex whenever
i=0 BX (xi, r) 6= ∅
i=0 BX (xi, r) 6= ∅). We write VR(X; r) or ˇC(X; r) when a statement is true for either choice of
(resp.
inequality, < or ≤, applied consistently throughout.

The Wasserstein or Kantorovich metric. All of the statements in this subsection follow from [17, 23, 24],
and we mainly use the notation from [17]. Let (X, d) be an arbitrary metric space. A measure µ deﬁned on
the Borel sets of X is a Radon measure if it is inner regular, i.e. µ(B) = sup{µ(K) | K ⊆ B is compact} for
all Borel sets B, and if it is locally ﬁnite, i.e. every point x ∈ X has a neighborhood U such that µ(U ) < ∞.

The inﬁmum in this deﬁnition is attained (see [17, page 388], and also [23, 24]). This metric, which gives
a solution to the Monge-Kantorovich problem, has many names: the Kantorovich, Wasserstein, optimal
transport, or earth mover’s metric; see Vershik’s survey [40].

A generalization of the Kantorovich–Rubinstein theorem for arbitrary (possibly non-compact) metric

d(δx, δy) = d(x, y).

In [42, page 99], Villani writes “Wasserstein distances incorporate a lot of the geometry of the space. For
instance, the mapping x 7→ δx is an isometric embedding . . . but there are much deeper links.” Our Theo-
rems 4.2 and 4.4 are evidence that the Wasserstein distances, at small scales, incorporate not only geometry
but also homotopy information.

Remark 3.2. The Vietoris–Rips thickening VRm(X; r) need not be homeomorphic to its corresponding
complex VR(X; r). Indeed, as a simplicial complex VR(X; r) is metrizable if and only if it is locally ﬁnite;
see Sakai [34, Proposition 4.2.16(2)]. In other words, if VR(X; r) is not locally ﬁnite, then it is impossible
to equip it with any metric without changing the homeomorphism type.

Remark 3.4. The metric thickening VRm(X; r) is rarely complete or compact, except when X is ﬁnite
or discrete.
Indeed, see Section D. This situation could be improved by considering a diﬀerent space,
those measures µ whose support has diameter at most r, with no requirement that the support be ﬁnite.
Theorem 6.18 of [42] implies that if X is Polish (complete and separable), then this space of measures of
bounded support is Polish (indeed, it is a closed subset of a Polish space). Similarly, [42, Remark 6.19]
implies that this space of measures of bounded support is compact if X is. Furthermore, for X compact a
metric version of Hausmann’s theorem would still be true for this space of measures of bounded support, as
outlined in Remark 4.3. We instead consider the Vietoris–Rips thickening VRm(X; r) in which all measures
have ﬁnite support, as it is more directly related to the Vietoris–Rips complex (in which all simplices are
ﬁnite). Nevertheless, the space of measures of bounded support (without an assumption of ﬁniteness) is
natural to consider.

The Vietoris–Rips thickening is only one example of a more general construction.

Deﬁnition 3.5. Let X be a metric space and let K be a simplicial complex with vertex set V (K) = X.
The metric thickening K m is the following submetric space of P(X), equipped with the restriction of the

Lemma 3.6. If K m is a metric thickening of metric space X such that each simplex of K has diameter at
most r ≥ 0, then K m is an r-thickening of X.

We may therefore say K m is a metric r-thickening if each simplex of K has diameter at most r. Note

VRm(X; r) is a metric r-thickening and ˇCm(X; r) is a metric 2r-thickening.

We brieﬂy relate metric thickenings to conﬁguration spaces. Let X be a metric space and K a simplicial

complex on vertex set X. Denote the n-skeleton of K m by Sn(K m) = {
i=0 λixi ∈ K m | k ≤ n}, and
denote the conﬁguration space of n + 1 unordered points in X by Cn+1X. If K is the maximal simplicial
complex on vertex set X, then we have Sn(K m) \ Sn−1(K m) ≃ Cn+1(X) where a deformation retraction is
obtained by collapsing each open simplex to its barycenter. A related space is expn+1 X, the set of all ﬁnite
subsets of X of cardinality at most n + 1, as studied by Tuﬄey in [39].

3.1. Basic properties. We describe a basic result on the continuity of maps between metric thickenings
induced from maps on the underlying metric spaces, and a result on the continuity of linear homotopies on
metric thickenings.

Let X, Y be metric spaces and K, L be simplicial complexes with vertex sets V (K) = X, V (L) = Y .
Note that if f : X → Y has the property that f (σ) is a simplex in L for each simplex σ ∈ K, then the
induced map ˜f : K m → Lm deﬁned by
i λif (xi) exists. For example, if f : X → Y has the
property that d(x, x′) ≤ r implies d(f (x), f (x′)) ≤ r, then the induced map ˜f : VRm

A metric thickening K m abstractly is the space of convex combinations of points in X, and taking convex

in the following lemma.

Proof. Note that H is the composition of the continuous map (µ, t) 7→ (µ, f (µ), t) with L : K m × K m × I →
K m deﬁned by L(µ, ν, t) = (1 − t)µ + tν. For any map g : X → R with Lipschitz constant at most one, and

4. Metric analogues of Hausmann’s theorem and the nerve lemma

In this section we prove metric analogues of Hausmann’s theorem, the nerve lemma, and Latschev’s
theorem. Let M be a Riemannian manifold. Hausmann’s theorem [21, Theorem 3.5] states that there exists
some real number r(M ) suﬃciently small (depending on the scalar curvature of M ) such that if 0 < r ≤ r(M ),
then VR<(M ; r) is homotopy equivalent to M . Hausmann’s homotopy equivalence T : VR<(M ; r) → M is
extremely non-canonical; it depends on the choice of an arbitrary total ordering of all of the points in M .
Furthermore, if M is not a discrete metric space then the inclusion M ֒→ VR<(M ; r) is not continuous and
hence cannot be a homotopy inverse. By contrast, we use Karcher means to deﬁne a map g : VRm(M ; r) → M
which is a homotopy equivalence for r suﬃciently small (Theorem 4.2). A key feature of our proof is that
we give a canonical choice for map g, which furthermore has the continuous inclusion M ֒→ VRm(M ; r) as
a homotopy inverse. A similar proof works also for the ˇCech thickening in Theorem 4.4.

The following technology regarding Karcher means is from [22]. Let the complete Riemannian manifold

M and real number ρ > 0 satisfy the following conditions:

(i) For each m ∈ M , the geodesic ball B(m, ρ) of radius ρ about m is convex, meaning the shortest

geodesic between any two points in B(m, ρ) is unique in M and lies in B(m, ρ).

(ii) The manifold M has sectional curvature bounds δ ≤ K ≤ ∆, where if ∆ > 0 then we also assume

2ρ < 1

2 π∆−1/2.

Given a probability measure µ with support contained in an open ball B of M of radius at most ρ, the
function Pµ : B → R deﬁned by

Pµ(x) =

1
2

d(x, y)2 dµ

Zy∈M
has a unique minimum in B (see [22, Deﬁnition 1.3]). This minimizer is denoted Cµ, and called the center
of mass or the Karcher mean. Furthermore, [22, Corollary 1.6] bounds the variation of the Karcher mean:
if µ and ν are probability measures with support in an open ball B of radius ρ, then

(3)

d(Cµ, Cν ) ≤ (1 + c(δ, ∆)(2ρ)2)

d(x, y) d(µ × ν).

Z(x,y)∈M×M

Let K a simplicial complex on vertex set M such that the vertices of each simplex are contained in an open
k
i=0 λixi in the metric thickening K m is a measure with support
ball of radius ρ. Note that a point µ =
contained in an open ball of radius at most ρ. Using the Karcher mean, we deﬁne a map g : K m → M by
setting g(µ) = Cµ.

P

Lemma 4.1. Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold and ρ > 0 be a real number satisfying (i) and (ii).
Suppose K m is a metric thickening of M such that each simplex of K has diameter at most r < ρ. Then the
map g : K m → M is continuous.

j ∈ {x′

Hence for all µ, µ′ with d(µ, µ′) < ρ − r, we have

d(g(µ), g(µ′)) = d(Cµ, Cµ′ ) ≤ (1 + c(δ, ∆)(2ρ)2)

We can now prove our main result: the Vietoris–Rips thickening of a complete Riemannian manifold M

accurately recovers the homotopy type of M for suﬃciently small distance parameter r.

Theorem 4.2 (Metric Hausmann’s theorem). Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold and ρ > 0 be a
real number satisfying (i) and (ii). For r < ρ, the map g : VRm(M ; r) → M is a homotopy equivalence.

Proof. The inclusion map ι : M → VRm(M ; r) is an isometric embedding, and hence continuous. Since
r < ρ, the map g : VRm(M ; r) → M is deﬁned and continuous. We will show that ι and are homotopy
inverses. Note g ◦ ι = idM .

We must show ι◦g ≃ idVRm(M;r). Deﬁne H : VRm(M ; r)×[0, 1] → VRm(M ; r) by H(µ, t) = (1−t)µ+t(ι◦
g)(µ). Note H(−, 0) = idVRm(M;r) and H(−, 1) = ι ◦ g, and hence it suﬃces to show that H is well-deﬁned
and continuous.

k

To see that H is well-deﬁned, let µ =

i=0 λixi ∈ VRm(M ; r); it suﬃces to show that [x0, . . . , xk, g(µ)]
is a simplex in VR(M ; r). For the < case, note µ ∈ VRm
< (M ; r) implies {x0, . . . , xk} ⊆ B(xi, r) for all i,
giving g(µ) ∈ ∩iB(xi, r) by [22, Deﬁnition 1.3] as required. For the ≤ case, for each i and ε > 0 we have
that {x0, . . . , xk} ⊆ B(xi, r + ε), giving g(µ) ∈ ∩iB(xi, r + ε) for all ε > 0 and hence g(µ) ∈ ∩iB(xi, r). In
either case we have that [x0, . . . , xk, g(µ)] ∈ VR(M ; r), so H is well-deﬁned.

P

Map H is continuous by Lemma 3.9, and therefore g : VRm(M ; r) → M is a homotopy equivalence. (cid:3)

The paper [3] proves a variant of the metric Hausmann’s theorem when manifold M is instead a subset

of Euclidean space, equipped with the Euclidean metric.

Remark 4.3. The following observation is due to an anonymous referee. Generalize the deﬁnition of the
Karcher mean to arbitrary metric spaces, and suppose that X is a compact metric space and K a simplicial
complex with vertices in a subset of X, such that for any measure µ ∈ K m the Karcher mean is well-deﬁned,
and, in particular, unique. One such example is when X is a Hadamard space, i.e., a globally nonpositively
curved space [37, Proposition 4.3]. Then the map g in Lemma 4.1 is well-deﬁned and continuous. To see the
continuity of g, let µn ∈ K m be a sequence of measures converging to µ. Then by compactness of X their
Karcher means g(µn) have a convergent subsequence with limit point z. Now,

|g(µn) − x|2 dµn(x) ≤

|y − x|2 dµn(x)

ZX

for all y by deﬁnition of the Karcher mean. In particular, by passing to the convergent subsequence and
X |y − x|2 dµ(x) for all y. Thus z is the Karcher mean of µ.
taking limits we see that
Certainly the sequence g(µn) does not have an accumulation point diﬀerent from z, as this would contradict
R
9

X |z − x|2 dµ(x) ≤

R

the uniqueness of Karcher means. By compactness g(µn) converges to z = g(µ). This shows the continuity
of g. Notice that all we used is that Karcher means of a converging sequence of measures µn ∈ K m are
eventually contained in a compact set. By the same proof as that of Theorem 4.2, it follows that if X is a
compact metric space and VRm(X; r) is a metric thickening such that for any measure µ ∈ VRm(X; r) the
Karcher mean is well-deﬁned, then the continuous map g : VRm(X; r) → X is a homotopy equivalence.

Recall that the ˇCech complex ˇC(M ; r) has vertex set M and a k-simplex {x0, . . . , xk} if

k
i=0 Br(xi) 6= ∅.
For r suﬃciently small all these r-balls and their nonempty intersections are contractible, and thus ˇC(M ; r)
is homotopy equivalent to M by the nerve lemma. The metric ˇCech thickening ˇCm(M ; r) is not a simplicial
complex and the nerve lemma does not apply. Nonetheless, in a similar fashion to Theorem 4.2 we can show
that our metric analogue of the ˇCech complex is homotopy equivalent to M .

T

Theorem 4.4 (Metric nerve lemma). Let M be a complete Riemannian manifold and ρ > 0 be a real number
satisfying (i) and (ii). For r < ρ

2 , the map g : ˇCm(M ; r) → M is a homotopy equivalence.

Proof. We will show that the inclusion ι : M → ˇCm(M ; r) and the Karcher mean map g : ˇCm(M ; r) → M
are homotopy inverses. Note g is deﬁned and continuous by Lemma 4.1 since r < ρ
2 . As before deﬁne
H : ˇCm(M ; r) × [0, 1] → ˇCm(M ; r) by H(µ, t) = (1 − t)µ + tg(µ). By Lemma 3.9 it suﬃces to show that
(1 − t)µ + tg(µ) ∈ ˇCm(M ; r) for any µ ∈ ˇCm(M ; r). Let µ =
< (M ; r), that is, there is a
y ∈ M with d(y, xi) < r for all i. Since x0, . . . , xk ∈ B(y, r) we have that g(µ) ∈ B(y, r), which implies that
tµ + (1 − t)g(µ) ∈ ˇCm
< (M ; r). The ≤ case follows from the same approximation argument as in the proof of

5. Vietoris–Rips thickenings of spheres

In this section we study the Vietoris–Rips thickenings of n-spheres, and in particular, in Theorem 5.4
we describe the ﬁrst new homotopy type (after that of the n-sphere) that appears as the scale parameter
increases. In order to prove this result, we ﬁrst need to study the continuity properties of maps from metric
thickenings into Euclidean space.

Maps to Euclidean space. Let X be a metric space and K a simplicial complex with V (K) = X. We
study when a map from X into Rn induces a continuous map on a metric thickening K m of X. Given
a function f : X → Rn, by an abuse of notation we also let f : K m → Rn denote the map deﬁned by

λixi 7→

λif (xi), where

λif (xi) is a linear combination of vectors in Rn.

P

Remark 5.1. Note that f : X → Rn continuous need not imply f : K m → Rn is continuous. Indeed, as in

Remark 3.8, let

P

X = {(0, 0)} ∪ {( 1

simplicial complex on vertex set X. Note that µn = n−1

The next lemma follows from [42, Theorem 6.9] if X is Polish, (or from [35, Theorem 5.11] if X is
Euclidean). We have included a proof since for ﬁnitely supported measures, the result also holds in the
non-Polish case.

Lemma 5.2. Let K m be a metric thickening of metric space X. If f : X → Rn is continuous and bounded,
then so is f : K m → Rn.

To see that f : K m → Rn is bounded, note that f (K m) is contained in conv(f (X)).

(cid:3)

A similar result, which is not hard to verify, is that if K m is a metric thickening of metric space X, and

if f : X → Rn is c-Lipschitz, then so is f : K m → Rn.

Vietoris–Rips thickenings of spheres. Let An+2 be the alternating group on n+2 elements. For example,
the group A3 is isomorphic to Z/3Z, and the group A4 is also known as the tetrahedral group. In a non-
canonical fashion, we can view An+2 as a subgroup of SO(n+ 1), as follows. Fix a regular (n+ 1)-dimensional
simplex inscribed in Sn inside Rn+1, with the center of the simplex at the origin. The (n + 1)-simplex has
n + 2 vertices, and An+2 as its group of rotational symmetries. We can therefore associate each element
g ∈ An+2 with a rotation matrix in SO(n + 1) that permutes the vertices of the simplex in the same way that
g does. After this non-canonical identiﬁcation as a subgroup, An+2 acts on SO(n + 1) via left multiplication,
and we let SO(n+1)
as the moduli space of regular
(n + 1)-simplices inscribed in Sn ⊆ Rn+1.

be the orbit space of this action.3 We also think of SO(n+1)

Denote by Sn the n-dimensional sphere equipped with either the Euclidean or the geodesic metric, and
let rn be the diameter of an inscribed regular (n + 1)-simplex in Sn. We will show in Proposition 5.3 and

of SO(n + 1) using a diﬀerent inscribed (n + 1)-simplex.

Let f : VRm

its corresponding linear combination in Rn+1. This map f is continuous by Lemma 5.2. Let π : Rn+1 \ {~0} →

inscribed in VR≤(Sn; rn). More precisely,

< (Sn; rn), or VRm

We will show that the homotopy inverse to πf is the inclusion map i : Sn ֒→ Y , which is continuous only
since Y is equipped with the Wasserstein metric. Clearly πf ◦ i = idSn . In order to show i ◦ πf ≃ idY ,
deﬁne homotopy H : Y × I → Y by H(µ, t) = (1 − t)µ + t · iπf (µ). This map is well-deﬁned because

i=0 λixi, then {x0, . . . , xk, πf (µ)} is a simplex in Y ; see [3]. Since πf is continuous, map H is

6. Maps between Vietoris–Rips complexes and thickenings

Let X be a metric space and K a simplicial complex on vertex set X. We study some of the basic
relationships between the simplicial complex K and the metric thickening K m. Note there is a natural
bijection from the geometric realization of K to K m, given by
λiδxi. We will show that
the function K → K m is continuous, a homeomorphism if X is ﬁnite, and a weak equivalence if X is
discrete (Property 6.1–6.6). The reverse function K m → K is continuous if and only if K is locally ﬁnite
(Property 6.3). By an abuse of notation, we will let µ denote both

λixi 7→

P

P

λiδxi and

λixi.

As corollaries, we deduce that in the restricted setting of ﬁnite metric spaces, there are metric analogues
of Latschev’s theorem and the stability of persistent homology (Corollaries 6.8 and 6.13). We conjecture
that these theorems hold also in the case of arbitrary metric spaces (Conjecture 6.9 and Conjecture 6.14),
but this is currently unknown.

One could also compare the spaces considered in this section to the metric of barycentric coordinates in [5,

Section 7A.5] and [15]. A related construction is given in [30].

Proposition 6.1. If K m is a metric thickening, then the function K → K m is continuous.

Proof. The simplicial complex K is equipped with the coherent topology, and therefore a map K → K m
is continuous if and only if its restriction σ → K m is continuous for each closed simplex σ in K. If σ is
13

a k-simplex, then its topology is induced from the Euclidean metric after embedding σ into Rk+1 in the
standard way. After giving σ this metric, one can show that σ → K m is Lipschitz and hence continuous. (cid:3)

Proposition 6.2. If K m is a metric thickening of a ﬁnite metric space X, then the function K → K m is
a homeomorphism.

Proof. Denote the function by h : K → K m. For any closed simplex σ in K, note h(σ) is closed in K m
since a convergent sequence of points in h(σ) must converge to a point in h(σ). In the proof of Property 6.1
we showed that each map h : σ → h(σ) is Lipschitz after equipping σ with the Euclidean metric, but more
is true: the map h : σ → h(σ) is bi-Lipschitz and hence a homeomorphism. Therefore h−1 : K m → K is
(cid:3)
continuous as it is formed by gluing together continuous maps on a ﬁnite number of closed sets h(σ).

Proposition 6.3. Let K m be a metric r-thickening. The map K m → K is continuous if and only if K is
locally ﬁnite.

Proof. Suppose K is locally ﬁnite. Let {µj} be a sequence converging to µ =

k
i=0 λixi in K m. Deﬁne

Y = {x ∈ X | there exists i and x′ ∈ X with d(xi, x′), d(x′, x) ≤ r}.

P

Note that Y is ﬁnite since local ﬁniteness of K implies there are only a ﬁnite number points x′ within distance
r from any xi, and also only a ﬁnite number of points x within distance r from any x′. There exists some
J such that j ≥ J implies µj ∈ K[Y ]m, since for any µ′ /∈ K[Y ]m we have dKm (µ′, µ) > r. Since {µj}j≥J
converges to µ in K[Y ]m, Property 6.2 implies that {i(µj)}j≥J converges to i(µ) in |K[Y ]|, and hence also
in K.

For the reverse direction, suppose K is not locally ﬁnite. Then some point x ∈ X is contained in an
inﬁnite number of simplices, and hence in an inﬁnite number of edges. Let x1, x2, x3, . . . be a sequence of
distinct vertices in X such that each [x, xi] is an edge of K. The sequence (1 − 1
i δui converges to
δx in K m. However, this sequence does not converge to x in the geometric realization of K. Indeed, any
convergent sequence together with its limit point is compact, but the set {x} ∪ {(1 − 1
i xi | i ≥ 1} is
not compact in the geometric realization of K because it is not contained in a ﬁnite union of simplices. (cid:3)

i )δx + 1

i )x + 1

Combining Property 6.1 and Property 6.3 gives the following.

Corollary 6.4. If K m is a metric r-thickening and K is locally ﬁnite, then the function K → K m is a
homeomorphism.

Remark 6.5. We now develop machinery which will allow us to understand the homotopy type of K m using
the nerve lemma. The argument is similar to that used in [2, Theorem 5.2] to prove a version of Hausmann’s
theorem for simplicial complexes embedded in Euclidean space.

Let X be an arbitrary metric space and let K be a simplicial complex on vertex set X. For σ ⊆ X, denote

by

st(σ) =

λxx ∈ K m | σ ⊆ τ, τ ∈ K, λx > 0,

λi = 1

the star of σ. We will consider the covering of K m by the sets U = {st(x) | x ∈ X}. For any ﬁnite σ ⊆ X
x∈σ st(x) = st(σ). Note st(σ) = ∅ if and only if σ /∈ K; this implies that the nerve of U is
we have that
1
isomorphic to K. If st(σ) is nonempty it is contractible:
let µ =
|σ| x be the barycenter of σ, then

is a deformation retraction to the point µ. It follows that the sets in U and their ﬁnite intersections are either
empty or contractible. Hence whenever the nerve lemma applies to the covering U, we get as a consequence
that K is homotopy equivalent to K m. In particular, since every metric space is paracompact [36, 33], the
nerve lemma as stated in Corollary 4G.3 of [20] applies whenever U is a family of open sets.

If X is discrete then the sets st(x) are open, and we obtain:

Proposition 6.6. If K m is a metric thickening of a discrete metric space X, then K ≃ K m.

Proof. Fix x ∈ X; we only need to show that st(x) is open. Since X is discrete, there exists some ε(x) > 0
such that BX (x, ε) = {x}. Given µ ∈ st(x), let λx > 0 be the coeﬃcient of x. Note that any point in the
open ball BKm(µ, λxε) must contain a positive coeﬃcient for x. It follows that BKm(µ, λxε) ⊆ st(x), and
(cid:3)
hence st(x) is open in K m.

Remark 6.7. For X = R (which is not discrete), the open star of 0 is not open in VRm
that the sequence 1

We end this section with three corollaries of Property ??. Latschev’s Theorem [25] states that if M
is a closed Riemannian manifold, then for any r suﬃciently small there exists a δ (depending on r) such
that if dGH(M, X) < δ, then VR<(X; r) ≃ M . We immediately get an analogue of Latschev’s theorem for
Vietoris–Rips thickenings when X is ﬁnite.

Corollary 6.8 (Metric Latschev’s theorem). If M is a closed Riemannian manifold, then for any r suﬃ-
ciently small there exists a δ such that if ﬁnite X satisﬁes dGH(M, X) < δ, then VRm

< (X; r) ≃ M .

Proof. Since X is ﬁnite, Property 6.2 gives that VRm
have VR<(X; r) ≃ M by Latschev’s theorem [25].

< (X; r) and VR<(X; r) are homeomorphic. Then we
(cid:3)

Conjecture 6.9. We conjecture that Corollary 6.8 is true even for X inﬁnite.

The next two corollaries relate to persistent homology [16, 10]. If X a metric space, then VRm(X; −),
VR(X; −), ˇCm(X; −), and ˇC(X; −) deﬁne ﬁltered topological spaces (since r ≤ r′ implies VRm(X; r) ⊆
VRm(X; r′)). We let PHi(VRm(X; −)) denote the persistent homology module of VRm(X; −) in homological
dimension i ≥ 0.

Corollary 6.10. Let X be a ﬁnite metric space. For any dimension i ≥ 0 the persistent homology modules
PHi(VRm(X; −)) and PHi(VR(X; −)) are isomorphic, and the persistent homology modules PHi( ˇCm(X; −))
and PHi( ˇC(X; −)) are isomorphic.

Proof. Note that if r ≤ r′, then the following diagrams commute.

The result now follows from Property 6.2.

(cid:3)

Remark 6.11. When the metric space X is inﬁnite, it is known that the persistent homology modules
≤ (X; −)) and PHi(VR≤(X; −)) can diﬀer at the endpoints of intervals. For example, PH3(VRm

consists of the single half-open interval [ 1

( 1

3 , 2

5 ), whereas PH3(VR≤(S1; −)) consists of the single open interval

Conjecture 6.12. We conjecture that for M a Riemannian manifold, the persistent homology modules
PHi(VRm(M ; −)) and PHi(VR(M ; −)) are identical up to replacing closed interval endpoints with open
endpoints, or vice-versa.

Corollary 6.13. Let X and Y be ﬁnite metric spaces and i ≥ 0. Then

db(PHi(VRm(X; −), PHi(VRm(Y ; −))) ≤ 2dGH(X, Y )
db(PHi( ˇCm(X; −), PHi( ˇCm(Y ; −))) ≤ 2dGH(X, Y ),

where db denotes the bottleneck distance between persistent homology modules.

Proof. This follows from Corollary 6.10 and [11, Theorem 5.2].

(cid:3)

Conjecture 6.14. We conjecture that Corollary 6.13 is true even for X and Y inﬁnite.

Appendix A. Metric thickenings and the Gromov–Hausdorff distance

In this section we study how the Vietoris–Rips thickening behaves with respect to the Gromov–Hausdorﬀ
distance between metric spaces. The ﬁrst result along these lines is Lemma 3.6, which implies that the
Gromov-Hausdorﬀ distance between X and VRm(X; r) is at most r.

If X and Y are isometrically embedded in a common metric space Z, then we let dZ

H(X, Y ) denote the

Hausdorﬀ distance between X and Y in Z.

Lemma A.1. If X and Y are metric spaces with dGH(X, Y ) = ε, then

dGH(VRm(X; r), VRm(Y ; r)) ≤ r + ε
dGH( ˇCm(X; r), ˇCm(Y ; r)) ≤ r + ε

Proof. Let δ > 0. Let Z be a metric space containing isometric embeddings of X and Y with dZ
H(X, Y ) ≤ ε+δ.
Note that VRm(Z; r) contains isometric copies of VRm(X; r) and VRm(Y ; r). Given µ ∈ VRm(X; r), note
by Lemma 3.6 we have

dVRm(Z;r)(µ, VRm(Y ; r)) ≤ dVRm(Z;r)(µ, Y ) ≤ dVRm(Z;r)(µ, X) + dVRm(Z;r)(X, Y )

= dVRm(X;r)(µ, X) + dZ

H(X, Y ) ≤ r + ε + δ.

The same argument works symmetrically for any µ ∈ VRm(Y ; r), giving
dVRm(Z;r)

(VRm(X; r), VRm(Y ; r)) ≤ r + ε + δ.

H

Since such a Z exists for every δ > 0, this shows that dGH(VRm(X; r), VRm(Y ; r)) ≤ r + ε. An identical
argument works for ˇCech complexes.
(cid:3)

Remark A.2. The dependence of this bound on r cannot be completely removed. Consider X = { −r−ε
and Y = { −r+ε
[ −r+ε

Lemma A.3. If X and Y are metric spaces, then

dGH(VRm(X; ∞), VRm(Y ; ∞)) = dGH(X, Y ).

Proof. Let Z be a metric space equipped with isometric embeddings of X and Y such that dZ
H(X, Y ) ≤
dGH(X, Y )+ε. Note that VRm(Z; ∞) contains isometric copies of VRm(X; ∞) and VRm(Y ; ∞). If
λixi ∈
VRm(X; ∞), then there exist points yi ∈ Y with dZ(xi, yi) ≤ dGH(X, Y ) + ε, and therefore the distance in
VRm(Z; ∞) between

λiyi ∈ VRm(Y ; ∞) is at most dGH(X, Y ) + ε. It follows that

λixi and

(VRm(X; ∞), VRm(Y ; ∞)) ≤ dGH(X, Y ) + ε.

Since such a Z exists for every ε > 0, this shows dGH(VRm(X; ∞), VRm(Y ; ∞)) ≤ dGH(X, Y ).

For the converse direction, let Z be any metric space equipped with isometric embeddings of VRm(X; ∞)
and VRm(Y ; ∞). Note that Z also contains isometric embeddings of X and Y . Without loss of generality,
there is a point x ∈ X with dZ (x, y) ≥ dZ
H(X, Y ) for all y ∈ Y (perhaps after interchanging X with Y ). It
follows that for the corresponding Dirac delta mass δx ∈ VRm(X; ∞), we have dZ (δx,
H(X, Y )
H(X, Y ) ≥ dGH(X, Y ). Since this is
for all
P
true for all metric spaces Z equipped with isometric embeddings of VRm(X; ∞) and VRm(Y ; ∞), we obtain
(cid:3)
dGH(VRm(X; ∞), VRm(Y ; ∞)) ≥ dGH(X, Y ).

H(VRm(X; ∞), VRm(Y ; ∞)) ≥ dZ

λiyi ∈ VRm(Y ; ∞). Hence dZ

Appendix B. Crushings

Let X be a metric space and let A ⊆ X be equipped with the subspace metric. The goal of this
section is to prove that if there is a crushing of bounded speed from X onto A, then the inclusion maps
VRm(A; r) ֒→ VRm(X; r) and ˇCm(A; r) ֒→ ˇCm(X; r) are homotopy equivalences.

Recall from [21] that a crushing from X onto A is a continuous map F : X × [0, 1] → X satisfying

(i) F (x, 1) = x, F (x, 0) ∈ A, F (a, t) = a if a ∈ A, and
(ii) d(F (x, t′), F (y, t′)) ≤ d(F (x, t), F (y, t)) whenever t′ ≤ t.

For notational convenience, deﬁne ft : X → X by ft(x) = F (x, t). We say that a crushing has bounded speed
c if d(ft(x), ft′ (x)) ≤ c|t − t′| for all x ∈ X.

Lemma B.1. If there is a crushing of bounded speed from X onto a subset A ⊆ X, then the inclusion maps
VRm(A; r) ֒→ VRm(X; r) and ˇCm(A; r) ֒→ ˇCm(X; r) are homotopy equivalences.

Proof. Let F be a crushing from X to A of bounded speed c. Note that (ii) implies d(ft(x), ft(y)) ≤ d(x, y),
and hence each ft is 1-Lipschitz.

Let ι : A ֒→ X denote the inclusion map. Since ι and f0 : X → A are 1-Lipschitz, the maps ˜ι : VRm(A; r) ֒→
VRm(X; r) and ˜f0 : VRm(X; r) → VRm(A; r) are deﬁned and continuous by Lemma 3.7. We will show that
˜ι and ˜f0 are homotopy inverses. Since f0 ◦ ι = idA, it follows that ˜f0 ◦ ˜ι = idVRm(A;r).

We must show ˜ι ◦ ˜f0 ≃ idVRm(X;r). Consider the map ˜F : VRm(X; r) × [0, 1] → VRm(X; r) deﬁned by

(cid:3)

The proof for the ˇCech case is identical.

Appendix C. Examples where H∗(VR≤(X; r)) has infinite rank but H∗(VRm

≤ (X; r)) does not

Example C.1. Let X = [0, 1] × {0, 1} ⊆ R2. In [11, Section 5.2.1] it is remarked that VR≤(X; 1) with the
standard metric has uncountable 1-dimensional homology.

We now show that VRm

≤ (X; 1) with the Wasserstein metric is contractible. Note that a crushing of

bounded speed 1 from X to {(0, 0), (0, 1)} is given by F : X × [0, 1] → X deﬁned via

F ((s, 0), t) = (ts, 0) and F ((s, 1), t) = (ts, 1).

Hence by Lemma B.1 we have

VRm

equipped with the ℓ1 metric. In [11, Proposition 5.9] it is shown that VR≤(X; r) with the standard metric
has uncountable 1-dimensional homology for all r ∈ [1, 2].

We now show that VRm

≤ (X; r) with the Wasserstein metric is either homotopy equivalent to S0 or con-
tractible. Note that a crushing of bounded speed 2 from X onto {(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)} is given by F : X ×[0, 1] →

F ((s, 0, z), t) = (ts, 0, tz) and F ((s, 1 + 1

Appendix D. Vietoris–Rips thickenings are usually not complete

The following results show that the Vietoris–Rips thickening of a complete space need not be complete,

and that the Vietoris–Rips thickening of a compact space need not be compact.

Let X be a metric space and K a simplicial complex on vertex set X. Recall the n-skeleton of K m is
k
denoted Sn(K m) = {
i=0 λixi ∈ K m | k ≤ n}. The sets Sn(K m) are a countable closed covering of K m.
If the Sn(K m) have empty interior and hence are nowhere dense, then by Baire’s category Theorem K m
cannot be complete.

y0, . . . , yn+1 ∈ X with d(x0, yj) < min{ε, r − diam({x0, . . . , xk})} for all 0 ≤ j ≤ n + 1. Note µ′ =
