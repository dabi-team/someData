ABSTRACT
The RAVE survey, combined with proper motions and distance estimates, can be
used to study in detail stellar kinematics in the extended solar neighbourhood (solar
suburb). Using 72, 365 red clump stars, we examine the mean velocity components
in 3D between 6 < R < 10 kpc and −2 < Z < 2 kpc, concentrating on North-South
diﬀerences. Simple parametric ﬁts to the (R, Z) trends for Vφ and the velocity dis-
persions are presented. We conﬁrm the recently discovered gradient in mean Galac-
tocentric radial velocity, VR, ﬁnding that the gradient is marked below the plane
(δhVRi/δR = −8 kms
/kpc for Z < 0, vanishing to zero above the plane), with a Z
gradient thus also present. The vertical velocity, VZ , also shows clear, large-amplitude
) structure, with indications of a rarefaction-compression pattern,
(|VZ | = 17 kms
suggestive of wave-like behaviour. We perform a rigorous error analysis, tracing sources
of both systematic and random errors. We conﬁrm the North-South diﬀerences in VR
and VZ along the line-of-sight, with the VR estimated independent of the proper mo-
tions. The complex three-dimensional structure of velocity space presents challenges
for future modelling of the Galactic disk, with the Galactic bar, spiral arms and exci-
tation of wave-like structures all probably playing a role.

1 INTRODUCTION

The more we learn about our Galaxy, the Milky Way,
the more we ﬁnd evidence that it is not in a quiescent,

stable state. Rather, the emerging picture is of a Galaxy
in ﬂux, evolving under the forces of internal and exter-
nal interactions. Within the halo, there is debris left by
accretion events, the most signiﬁcant being the Sagittar-
ius stream (Majewski et al. 2003) at a mean distance of
d
40 kpc associated with the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy (Ibata, Gilmore & Irwin 1994). In the intersection
of halo and disk there are also indications of accretion de-
bris, such as the Aquarius Stream (0.5 < d < 10 kpc,
Williams et al. 2011) as well as local halo streams such as
the Helmi stream (d < 2.5 kpc, Helmi et al. 1999). While
within the disk itself there is evidence of large-scale stel-
lar over-densities: outward from the Sun at a Galacto-
centric distance of R = 18
20 kpc there is the Mono-
−
ceros Stream (Newberg et al. 2002, Yanny et al. 2003), in-
ward from the Sun (d
2 kpc) there is the Hercules thick
disk cloud (Larsen & Humphreys 1996, Parker et al. 2003,
Parker et al. 2004, Larsen, Humphreys & Cabenela 2008).
The origin of all such structures is not yet fully under-
stood: possible agents for the Monoceros ring are tidal
debris (see e.g., Penarrubia et al. 2005), the excitation of
the disk caused by accretion events (e.g., Kazantzidis et al.
2008) or the Galactic warp (Momany et al. 2006), while
Humphreys et al. 2011 conclude that the Hercules cloud is
most likely due to a dynamical interaction of the thick disk
with the Galaxy’s bar.

∼

Velocity space also exhibits structural complexity. In
the solar neighbourhood various structures are observed
in the distribution of stars in the U V plane, which diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from a smooth Schwarzschild distribution
(Dehnen 1998). These features are likely created by
the combined eﬀects of the Galactic bar (Raboud et al.
1998, Dehnen 1999, Minchev et al. 2010, Famaey et al.
2007)
(De Simone, Wu & Tremaine
2004; Quillen & Minchev 2005, Antoja et al. 2009) or
both (Chakrabarty 2007, Quillen et al. 2011). Dissolv-
ing open clusters (Skuljan, Cottrell & Hearnshaw 1997,
De Silva et al. 2007) can also contribute to structure in the
U V plane. Finally, velocity streams in the U V plane can be
explained by the perturbative eﬀect on the disk by recent
merger events (Minchev et al. 2009, Gomez et al. 2012).

and

Venturing beyond the solar neighbourhood into the so-
lar suburb, Antoja et al. 2012 used data from the RAdial Ve-
locity Experiment (RAVE) (Steinmetz et al. 2006) to show
how these resonant features could be traced far from the
Sun, up to 1 kpc from the Sun in the direction of anti-
rotation and 0.7 kpc below the Galactic plane. Additionally,
Siebert et al. 2011 (hereafter S11), showed based on RAVE
data that the components of stellar velocities in the direc-
tion of the Galactic centre, VR, is systematically non-zero
3 kms−1/kpc.
and has a non-zero gradient δ
A similar eﬀect was seen in the analysis of 4400 RAVE
red clump giants by Casetti et al. 2011. The cause of this
streaming motion has been variously ascribed to the bar,
spiral arms, and the warp in conjunction with a triax-
ial dark-matter halo, or a combination of all three. Re-
cently, Siebert et al. 2012 have used density-wave models
to explore the possibility that spiral arms cause the ra-
dial streaming, and were able to reproduce the gradient
with a two-dimensional model in which the Sun lies close
to the 4:1 ultra-harmonic resonance of two-arm spiral, in
agreement with Quillen & Minchev 2005 and Pomp´eia et al.

2011. While structure in the U V plane smears out with
the increase of sample depth (at d > 250 pc), Gomez et
al. (2012a,b) showed that energy-angular momentum space
preserves structure associated with “ringing” of the disk in
response to a minor merger event for distances around the
Sun as large as 3 kpc, consistent with the SEGUE and RAVE
coverage.

In this paper we examine the kinematics of the red
clump giants in the three-dimensional volume surveyed by
RAVE, focusing particularly on diﬀerences between the
northern and southern sides of the plane. The full space
velocities are calculated from RAVE line-of-sight velocities
(Vlos), literature proper motions and photometric distances
from the red clump. We have suﬃcient stars from the RAVE
internal data set for the stellar velocity ﬁeld to be explored
within the region 6 < R < 10 kpc and
2 < Z < 2 kpc.
While studies such as Pasetto et al. 2012a,b, distinguish be-
tween thick- and thin-disk stars, we do not. Distinguish-
ing between the thin, thick disk and halo require either
kinematic or chemical criteria, each of which have their
individual issues and challenges, which we wish to avoid.
Rather, our aim here is to describe the overall velocity
structure of the solar neighbourhood in a pure observa-
tional/phenomenological sense. The interpretation of this
based on thin or thick-disk behaviour is then secondary.

−

In S11, VR as a function of (X, Y ) was examined. Here
we extend this analysis to investigate particularly the Z de-
pendence of VR, as well as the other two velocity compo-
nents, Vφ and VZ, with a simple parametric ﬁt for Vφ pre-
sented. We ﬁnd that the average values of VR and VZ show a
strong dependence on three-dimensional position. We com-
pare these results to predictions of a steady-state, axisym-
metric Galaxy from the Galaxia (Sharma et al. 2011) code.
To visualise the 3D behaviour better, various projections are
used. Further, the detection by S11 of the gradient in VR us-
ing only line-of-sight velocities is re-examined in light of the
results seen in 3D, extending the analysis to include VZ.
As an aside, parametric ﬁts to the velocity dispersions are
presented.

The paper also includes a thorough investigation into
the eﬀects of systematic and measurement errors, which al-
most everywhere dominate Poisson noise. The assumptions
used to calculate photometric distances from the red clump
are examined in some detail, where we model the clump
using Galaxia. The eﬀects of using alternative sources of
proper motion are shown in comparison with the main re-
sults, as we found this to be one of the largest systematic
error sources.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we dis-
cuss our overall approach for the kinematic mapping, the
co-ordinate systems used and initial selection from RAVE.
In Section 3 we present a detailed investigation into the use
of the red clump stars as a distance indicator, where we in-
troduce a Galaxia model of the red clump to model the dis-
tance systematics. In Section 4 we present our error analysis,
investigating systematic error sources ﬁrst before discussing
measurement errors, Poisson noise and the ﬁnal cuts to the
data using the error values. In Section 5 we examine the 3D
spatial distribution of our data before going on in Section
6 to investigate the variation for VR, Vφ and VZ over this
space. Also presented are the variations in velocity disper-
sions with (R, Z) and a simple functional ﬁt to these trends.

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–22

In Section 7 we use the line-of-sight method to investigate
the VR and VZ trends towards and away from the Galactic
centre, while ﬁnally, Section 8 contains a summary of our
results.

2 RED CLUMP KINEMATICS WITH RAVE

DATA

2.1 Co-ordinate systems and Galactic parameters

As we are working at large distances from the solar posi-
tion, we use cylindrical co-ordinates for the most part, with
VR, Vφ and VZ deﬁned as positive with increasing R, φ and
Z, with the latter towards the North Galactic Pole (NGP).
We also use a right-handed Cartesian co-ordinate system
with X increasing towards the Galactic centre, Y in the di-
rection of rotation and Z again positive towards the NGP.
The Galactic centre is located at (X, Y, Z) = (R⊙, 0, 0).
Space velocities, U V W , are deﬁned in this system, with U
positive towards the Galactic centre.

To aid comparison with the predictions of Galaxia
(see Section 2.3), we use mostly the parameter values that
were used to make the model for which Galaxia makes
predictions. Thus, the motion of the Sun with respect to
the LSR is taken from Sch¨onrich, Binney & Dehnen 2010,
namely U⊙ = 11.1, V⊙ = 12.24, W⊙ = 7.25 kms−1. The
LSR is assumed to be on a circular orbit with circular veloc-
ity Vcirc = 226.84 kms−1. Finally, we take R⊙ = 8 kpc. The
only deviation from Galaxia’s values is that they assumed
that the Sun is located at Z = +15 pc, while we assume
Z = 0 pc.

S11 explored the variation of the observed VR gradient
on the values of Vcirc and R⊙, ﬁnding that changing these
parameters between variously accepted values could reduce
but not eliminate the observed gradient in VR. We do not
explore this in detail in this paper but note that the trends
that we observe are similarly aﬀected by the Galactic pa-
rameters; amplitudes are changed but the qualitative trends
remain the same.

2.2 RAVE data

The wide-ﬁeld RAVE (RAdial Velocity Experiment) sur-
vey measures primarily line-of-sight velocities and addition-
ally stellar parameters, metallicities and abundance ratios
of stars in the solar neighbourhood (Steinmetz et al. 2006;
Zwitter et al. 2008; Siebert et al. 2011; Boeche et al. 2011).
RAVE’s input catalog is magnitude limited (8 < I < 13)
and thus creates a sample with no kinematic biases. To the
end of 2012 RAVE had collected more than 550,000 spectra
with a median error of 1.2 kms−1 (Siebert et al. 2011b).

We use the internal release of RAVE from October 2011
which contains 434,807 RVs and utilizes the revised stellar
parameter determination (see the DR3 paper, Siebert et al.
2011b for details). We applied a series of cuts to the data.
Firstly, those stars ﬂagged by the Matijeviˇc et al. 2012 au-
tomated spectra classiﬁcation code as having peculiar spec-
tra were excluded. This removes most spectroscopic bina-
ries, chromospherically active and carbon stars, spectra with
continuum abnormalities and other unusual spectra. Further

cuts restricted our sample to stars with signal-to-noise ra-
tio ST N > 20 (STN is calculated from the observed spec-
trum alone with residuals from smoothing, see Section 2.2 of
the DR3), Tonry & Davis 1979 cross-correlation coeﬃcient
< 400 masyr−1, eµα, eµδ < 20 masyr−1,
R > 5,
RV < 600 kms−1 (see Section 4.4) and stars whose Spec-
traQualityFLAG is null. Where there are repeat observa-
tions, we randomly select one observation for each star. With
this cleaning, the data set has 293,273 unique stars with stel-
lar parameters from which to select the red clump.

K > 0.5 with the object
tion includes a colour cut J
of favouring giants. We imposed this colour cut through-
out this region to facilitate the comparison to predictions
by Galaxia. The selection of red clump stars is unaﬀected
by this cut. Additional data cuts and selections were per-
formed later in the analysis and are broadly a) the selection
of red-clump giants (Section 3.3), b) removal of stars with
large extinction/reddening (Section 4.1.5), and removal of
data bins with large errors in measurements of mean veloc-
ity (Section 4.4).

As a sample with alternative distance determinations,
we also used an internal release with stellar parameters pro-
duced by the pipeline that was used for the third Data Re-
lease (VDR3) and the method of Zwitter et al. 2008 from
September 2011 with 334,409 objects. We cleaned the sam-
ple as above, leaving us with 301,298 stars.

A newer analysis of RAVE data is presented in the 4th
RAVE data release, Kordopatis et al. (in preparation). This
applies an updated version of the Kordopatis et al. 2011
pipeline to RAVE spectra. Selecting red clump stars us-
ing the stellar parameters from this pipeline does not pro-
duce signiﬁcantly diﬀerent results to those selected using
the VDR3 pipeline above; the conclusions of this paper are
unaﬀected by the pipeline used for the red-clump selection.

2.3 The Galaxia model

In Williams et al. 2011 we introduced the use of the Galaxy
modelling code Galaxia (Sharma et al. 2011) to investigate
the statistical signiﬁcance of the new Aquarius stream found
with RAVE. In this study we use Galaxia both to provide
predictions with which to compare our results, and to inves-
tigate the eﬀects of contamination of the red-clump sample
by stars that are making their ﬁrst ascent of the giant branch
(see Section 4.1.1). Galaxia enables us to disentangle real
eﬀects from artifacts of our methodology, and further to un-
derstand the population we are examining.

Based on the Besan¸con Galaxy model, the Galaxia
code creates a synthetic catalog of stars for a given model of
the Milky Way. It oﬀers several improvements over the Be-
san¸con model which increase its utility in modelling a large-
scale survey like RAVE, the most signiﬁcant of which is the
ability to create a continuous distribution across the sky in-
stead of discrete sample points. The elements of the Galactic
model are a star formation rate, age-velocity relation, initial
mass function and density proﬁles of the Galactic compo-
nents (thin and thick disk, smooth spheroid, bulge and dark
halo). The parameters and functional forms of these compo-
nents are summarized in Table 1 of Sharma et al. 2011.

We follow a similar methodology to that described in
Williams et al. 2011 to generate a Galaxia model of the

described in Section 3.2, the RAVE data were then divided
into three signal-to-noise regimes and a sample drawn from
the Galaxia model so that, for each regime, the I-band
distribution was matched to that of the RAVE sample in
5◦ squares. The Galaxia I-band was generated after
5◦

3 THE RED CLUMP

The helium-burning intermediate-age red clump has long
been seen as a promising standard candle (Cannon et al.
1970), with its ease of
identiﬁcation on the HR dia-
gram. In recent years there has been a renewed inter-
est in the red clump for distance determination, e.g.,
Pietrzy´nski, Gieren & Udalski 2003 studied the clump in the
Local Group, down to the metal-poor Fornax dwarf galaxy.
Here we investigate the use, selection and modelling of this
population in solar-suburb RAVE data.

3.1 The Red Clump K-band magnitude

The K-band magnitude of the red clump, while being rela-
tively unaﬀected by extinction, has also been shown obser-
vationally to be only weakly dependent on metallicity and
age (Pietrzy´nski, Gieren & Udalski 2003; Alves 2000), so a
single magnitude is usually assigned for all stars in the red
clump. Studies such as Grocholski & Sarajedini 2002 and
van Helshoecht & Groenewegen 2007 have shown that there
is some dependence on metallicity and age which can be
accounted for by the theoretical model of Salaris & Girardi
2002.

If models correctly predict the systematic dependence
of MK of the red clump on metallicity and age, this would
have implications for our study of kinematics in the solar
suburb, for with increasing distance above the plane the
metallicity will decrease and the population become older.
From Burnett et al. 2011 we estimate that the population

Given the disagreement over the K-band magnitude for
the clump and possible metallicity/age variations, we in-
vestigated the use of the three normalizations for MKs for
our derivation of the RAVE red clump distances. Table 1
summarizes these values, where the Version A is the stan-
dard value from Alves 2000 and Grocholski & Sarajedini
2002, while Version B is the new value from Groenewegen
2008. Version C is derived from the theoretical models
of Salaris & Girardi 2002 and attempts to take into ac-
count some of the possible systematics for lower metallic-
ity stars, where we use the variation of age and metallicity
of RAVE stars described above (i.e., MKs (RC) =

a simple linear relation of MKs with Z, where the value for

3.2 The Galaxia red clump

To establish the best selection method for the red-clump
stars we ﬁrst tried to match the observed distribution of
the selected RC stars with the prediction of Galaxia. The
errors in RAVE stellar parameters decrease with STN, so
the red clump is more localized at higher STN values. Fur-
ther, the errors in Teﬀ and log g are correlated. To account
for this in the modelling of the clump, we split the data
into three regimes: STN values between 20 < STN < 40,
40 < STN < 60 and 60 < STN. We then generated Galaxia
models for each STN regime for 5◦
5◦ squares, match-
ing the I-band distribution of Galaxia to that of RAVE

tribution has mean log g

at lower STN it elongates but does not shift. Thus, the ef-
fect seen in the RAVE data appears not to be astrophysical
in origin but rather a result of the parameter determination
from RAVE spectra (for a discussion on systematic trends of
stellar parameter estimates with SNR see DR3). Also, there
is an absence of horizontal-branch stars below J

in the RAVE data relative to the prediction by Galaxia.
This latter diﬀerence does not aﬀect our results as they are

Figure 2 gives the distributions of the entire RAVE

motion, µ =
are also given, with an additional spread of 2 kms−1 and
2.7 masyr−1 added to the Galaxia line-of-sight velocity and
proper motion, respectively, to simulate the observational
uncertainties. These values give the average value of the er-
ror in these quantities for the RAVE catalog stars. Here we
see that Galaxia reproduces quite well the basic distribu-
tions of the two observational kinematic parameters which
aﬃrms our use of it in comparisons. The small diﬀerence in
the proper motion distribution could suggest that the actual
errors in proper motion are slightly larger than estimated.

4 ERROR ANALYSIS

The most problematic errors are systematic ones. There are
multiple ways that these can be introduced into the kine-
matics. We examine these in some detail before discussing
measurement errors in Section 4.2, Poisson noise in Section
4.3 and the ﬁnal data cuts in Section 4.4.

4.1 Systematic error sources

4.1.1 Contamination by ﬁrst-ascent giants

−

In the (J
K, log g) plane the red clump is overlaid on the
ﬁrst-ascent giant branch (see Figure 1). Our selection cri-
teria therefore also select ﬁrst-ascent giants, including some
sub-giants, which can lead to distance and velocity errors.
To assess how this contamination aﬀects our distances and
kinematics, we use the red-clump selected stars from the
Galaxia model and compute a distance to them assuming
a single red-clump magnitude. These results can then be
compared to the true values for the model stars. Galaxia
uses mainly Padova isochrones and with a median red-clump
K-band magnitude of MKs (RC) =
1.50. This is slightly
diﬀerent to that applied above to our data, but is not sig-
niﬁcant as we are only performing an internal comparison
with Galaxia.

−

Figure 3a shows the histogram of the parallax errors.
The distributions can be decomposed into two Gaussians;
one representing the red clump and the other ﬁrst-ascent
giants. Note that the histogram of distance errors does not
have such a tidy Gaussian decomposition, hence why we
work with the parallax errors. The spread in the red-clump
values is caused by the clump’s distribution in age and
metallicity; the average MK value chosen is not true for all
red-clump stars. The ﬁrst-ascent giants have larger errors
because while their log g values may overlap with the clump,
their absolute K-band magnitude can be quite diﬀerent.
40 per cent
From this decomposition we estimate that the

of selected stars are actually red-clump stars and the rest
are ﬁrst-ascent giants. Fortunately however, the mean of
the background distribution is very similar to that of the
red clump, with a systematic shift of only
2 per cent in
distance. In Figure 3b we plot the cumulative distribution
of the distance errors. From this we can see that despite
the high level of contamination, 80 per cent of stars have
distances errors of less that 25 per cent.

Z
|

To establish just how these distance errors aﬀect our re-
sults, we calculated (VR, Vφ, VZ) for stars in the solar cylin-
der (7.5 < R/kpc < 8.5) from the pseudo-data produced by
Galaxia using both the true distance to each star, and the
distance one infers from the star’s apparent magnitude and
a single RC MK . The upper panels of Figure 4 show the
resulting plots of mean velocity components as a function
of
. In the panels for VR and VZ the diﬀerences between
|
the velocities from true distances (solid line) and from ones
derived from a single absolute magnitude (dashed line) are
noticeable only at the limits of the surveyed region. In the
case of Vφ the single value of MK leads to a consistent un-
5 kms−1. The lower panels of Figure
derestimation by
4 show the corresponding results for stars that lie within
0.5 kpc of the plane, binned in R. Again the impact on VR
and VZ of using a single absolute magnitude is evident only
at the survey limits. We conclude that the use of a single
value of MK does not signiﬁcantly compromise our results.

∼

4.1.2 MK normalisation

In Section 3.1 we introduced three diﬀerent normalizations
for the MK value for the red clump. Figure 5 shows the eﬀect
of using these diﬀerent normalizations on the average values
of VR, Vφ, VZ for stars in the solar cylinder (top row of
panels) and for stars within 0.5 kpc of the plane (lower row).
We see that the diﬀerences in distance produced by the three
normalizations has an insigniﬁcant impact on the average

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–22

velocities: only at the limits of the survey, where sample
sizes are small, do the diﬀerences reach 15 kms−1. Thus the
dispersion in the velocity errors, on the order of 10 kms−1,
caused by the single MK assumption are averaged over and
thus all but vanish. It is only those bins - the farthest ones
- with the lower number of stars that show any eﬀect.

Given that the eﬀect of the absolute-magnitude nor-
malisation is minor, we use only normalization A for the
remainder of this analysis.

4.1.3 Proper motions

the

RAVE proper motions are derived from several sources,
catalog gives PPMX
although the majority of
(Roeser et al. 2008) or UCAC2 (Zacharias et al. 2004)
proper motions. To investigate the contribution of system-
atic proper-motion errors, we cross-matched with two ad-
ditional proper-motion catalogs, the third US Naval Obser-
vatory CCD Astrograph Catalog, UCAC3 (Zacharias et al.
2010), and the Yale/San Juan Southern Proper Motion Cat-
alog, SPM4 (Girard et al. 2011). The UCAC3 proper mo-
tions suﬀer from strong plate-dependent systematic distor-

exclude stars with δ >

20◦ in this catalog.

−

−

Figure 6 shows the mean values of VR, Vφ and VZ with R
20◦,
and Z for stars below δ =
1 < Y < 0 kpc calculated
using the three sources of proper motions, where the restric-
tions in δ and Y were made to keep as uniform as possible
the fractions of stars that have entries in each of the three
catalogs. The mean velocities do change with proper-motion
source, with the discrepancies largest between RAVE proper
motions and those from the SPM4 catalog. The divergence
is largest for Z <
1 kpc for VR and Vφ with diﬀerences up
to 20 kms−1 in Vφ. Some of these variations may be the
result of diﬀerent coverage of the sample volume – which we
have tried to minimize with the restrictions on δ, Y above.

Nevertheless, it does indicate that the proper motions are a
signiﬁcant source of systematic error.

It is diﬃcult to say a priori which catalog is closer to the
truth; a detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this pa-
per. Given that the systematic diﬀerences between proper-
motion catalogs can cause signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the de-
rived velocities, we use all three proper motion catalogs in
our further analysis, concentrating on the two most diver-
gent proper motions, namely those in the RAVE and SPM4
catalogs.

4.1.4 Binary stars

Two types of spectroscopic binaries can potentially aﬀect
our results; single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) stars
and double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) stars. Both
kinds introduced an additional velocity variation to the sam-
ple, with the magnitude much larger for SB2 stars. For the
SB2 stars, there is the additional problem that the RAVE
processing pipeline assumes that each observed spectrum is
that of a single star.

−

Matijeviˇc et al. 2011 uses repeat observations to esti-
mate the fraction of single-line spectroscopic (SB1) binary
stars in the RAVE sample, ﬁnding a lower limit of 10
15 %
of the sample consists of SB1 stars. The technique is biased
towards shorter period binaries, but can be used to gauge
the contribution to the measured dispersions from SB1 stars.
In Matijeviˇc et al. 2011 the mode of the distribution in the
velocity variation from the SB1 stars is 6 kms−1. Unde-
tected, long period binary stars will have smaller velocity
variations. Thus, the small additional velocity dispersion on
a limited fraction of the red clump stars from SB1 sources
can be neglected, especially as we are measuring mean ve-
locities in this paper. The fraction of SB2 stars in RAVE is
much smaller; Matijeviˇc et al. 2010 estimates 0.5 % of the
sample are SB2 stars. Many of these are ﬂagged however,
as well as any other peculiar stars, and have been removed
from the sample. Unresolved SB2 stars are fortunately rare
(Matijeviˇc et al. 2010) and these and the remaining SB2
stars do not aﬀect our results substantially.

4.1.5 Extinction correction

As in Williams et al. 2011, extinction is calculated itera-
tively from the distances using Schlegel et al. 1998 dust
maps and assuming a Galactic dust distribution as in
Beers et al. 2000. Note that the maps were adjusted using
the correction of Yasuda, Fukugita & Schneider 2007. The
extinction reaches relatively large values of AK > 0.1 for
< 10◦. However, the eﬀect on the velocities is minor; the
b
|
eﬀect of the extinction correction on the total space velocity
is greater than 5 kms−1 in only 1.6 per cent of red clump
stars. These stars were excluded from further analysis, leav-
ing 72,365 stars in our red clump sample.

|

4.2 Measurement errors

The non-systematic sources of errors in the kinematics can
be broadly broken into (i) the contribution of random un-
certainties in the measurements and (ii) the ﬁnite sample
size for each volume bin. We will examine each of these in

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–22

The wobbly Galaxy

turn, before discussing any kinematic cuts that were applied
to the data.

The Monte Carlo method of error propagation enables
an easy tracking of error covariances, so we employ it here by
generating a distribution of 100 test particles around each in-
put value of distance, proper motion, line-of-sight velocity2
and then calculating the resulting points in (VR, Vφ, VZ).
We assume that the proper motions and line-of-sight veloci-
ties have Gaussian errors with standard deviations given by
the formal errors for each star. For the distribution in dis-
tance for each star however, we generate a double-Gaussian
distribution in the parallax as in Figure 3, which we then
invert to derive the distance distribution. This takes into
account the fact that errors in distance are due both to the
intrinsic width of the RC and the mis-classiﬁcation of other
giants. The ratio between the RC and ﬁrst-ascent giants for
Galaxia model stars changes with distance, where we found
a smaller amount of contaminants for d > 1 kpc. The double-
Gaussian in parallax then has dispersions (0.05, 0.26) mas at
a ratio of 2 : 1 for d 6 1 kpc and 4 : 1 for d > 1 kpc.

4.3 Poisson noise

In each of the bins that are used to calculate the mean veloc-
ities, there are a ﬁnite number of stars N , so Poisson noise
contributes to the errors in the derived kinematic properties.
These errors scale as 1/√N . To establish the error contri-
bution from this source we used Bootstrap case resampling
with replacement: for each kinematic quantity we derived
a distribution in the values by randomly resampling from
the distribution of values in the bin. The variance in each
value could then be calculated from the resulting distribu-
tion. Poisson errors can dominate over measurement errors
in bins at large distances that contain very few stars.

To ensure that Poisson errors do not dominate our
plots, we only use bins which have Nstars > 50 and only
include those points that have errors in the mean of less
than 5 kms−1 (see Section 4.4).

4.4 Data cuts

There are several ways in which to prune the data to those
that are deemed more reliable. However, pruning is liable to
introduce kinematic biases. We investigated the eﬀects on
the measured velocities of trimming data via a) proper mo-
tion, b) error in proper motion, c) distance errors, d) mag-
nitude of total velocity and e) total velocity error, eVtotal.
In general, we found that as we increase the cut-oﬀ point
there is a steady increase in velocity dispersion and ﬂuctua-
tions in the average velocity, asymptotically approaching a
value as the number of stars approaches the full sample. It
is therefore diﬃcult to justify cuts that remove a signiﬁcant
proportion of stars. We therefore introduced cuts that re-
move only the outlier values, as given in Table 3, and we do
not perform a cut on eVtotal.

Since we seek only to follow trends with R, Z, we do
not distinguish between halo, thick and thin disk stars. The
cuts in total velocity therefore aim to be inclusive of halo
stars; the 600 kms−1 limit is
3σ the halo dispersion of

5 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION

Before examining the velocity trends it is helpful to examine
the spatial distribution, to see which regions the RAVE red
clump selection function samples. Figure 7 gives the XY Z

distribution for the RAVE red clump stars, where we have
diﬀerentiated between stars above and below the plane for
clarity. Due to RAVE’s magnitude limit, the red clump stars
sample a region between 0.3 < d < 2.8 kpc. This, combined
with RAVE’s uneven sky coverage between the Northern
and Southern Galactic hemispheres, means that the sample
region is mostly outside d > 0.5 kpc and Quadrants 1 and 2
above the plane are not sampled.

We now discuss the trends in each velocity component.

6 VELOCITY TRENDS

6.1 Vφ

Figure 8 displays the trends in mean VR, Vφ, VZ (hereafter
we drop the bracket notation for averages) as functions of
R for 0.5 kpc thick slices in Z using 0.5 kpc bins in R. Re-
sults are shown for three choices of proper motions: those
in the RAVE, UCAC3 and SPM4 catalogs. Also shown are
the results of the pseudo-data from Galaxia: the blue line
is obtained using the true distances to pseudo-stars, while
the green line uses distances inferred from RC magnitudes.
Figures 10, 12 and 13 display essentially the same results as
contour plots in the (R, Z) plane. However, to save space we

The top two panels of Figure 10 show that, as we might ex-
pect, Vφ is largest in the plane and decreases fairly symmet-
rically both above and below the plane. At given values of
Z, Vφ also decreases inwards. These trends are independent
of the distances used (RC or Zwitter) and of the adopted
proper-motion catalog, and they are exactly what the Jeans
equations lead us to expect: Vφ decreases as the asymmet-
ric drift increases and the asymmetric drift increases with
the velocity dispersion (see e.g. Binney & Tremaine 1998,
eq. (4.34)). In Figure 11 the velocity dispersion trends in Vφ

the data imply that Vφ falls away as we move away from
the plane signiﬁcantly more rapidly than Galaxia predicts.

6.2 VR

In the top panels of Figure 12, contours of constant VR are by
no means vertical, whether one adopts the proper motions in
the RAVE or SPM4 catalogs. In fact, with the SPM4 proper
motions the contours are not far from horizontal. Thus the
3 kms−1/kpc reported by S11 is
radial gradient δVR/δR =
at the very least just one aspect of a complex phenomenon.
In fact, if the SPM4 proper motions are correct, the trend
in VR is essentially that the further stars are from the plane,
the more they are moving away from the Galactic centre.

−

The middle panel of Figure 8 shows this situation in a
diﬀerent way by showing that the red curves for the SPM4
data are horizontal within the errors at all distances from
the plane, but they move down from VR

RAVE data-points tell a diﬀerent story in that in the panels

two panels for Z > 0 the data points from the RAVE proper
motions are consistent with no trend in VR with R with
the exception of the innermost point in the panel for Z

is consistent with the value of δVR/δR reported by S11 in

If the dominant gradient in VR is essentially in the
vertical direction and an even function of Z as the SPM4
proper motions imply, the suspicion arises that it is an ar-
tifact generated by the clear, and expected, gradient of the
same type that we see in Vφ. The gradient could be then
seen to be caused by systematics in the proper motions cre-
ating a correlation between the measured value of VR and
Vφ (see e.g. Sch¨onrich, Binney & Asplund 2012). In Section
7 we re-explore the line-of-sight detection of the VR, which is
a proper-motion-free approach to observing the radial gradi-
ent, which however corroborates the existence of a gradient
and North-South diﬀerences.

Sch¨onrich 2012 found a larger value of U⊙ = 14 kms−1
compared to that used in this study and S11, and suggest
that this larger value would reduce the gradient in VR. In
Figure 9 we plot V s
R, the Galactocentric radial velocity with
U⊙ = 14 kms−1. The qualitative trends are unaﬀected by
the higher value of U⊙, with the values only shifted down,
bringing the values in the 0.5 < Z < 1.0 kpc bin closer to
those predicted by Galaxia.

In Figure 14 the location of the spiral arms is overlaid
for reference on the full XY Z plots of VR trends. There
is some indication that structure in VR is coincident with
spiral arms in the
0.5 kpc region, with Quad-
rant 3 and Quadrant 4 showing the largest gradient. With

that spiral resonances would play a role. However, the recent
results of S12 which explained the gradient in terms of such
resonances suggests that they do exert an inﬂuence at large
distances from the Galactic plane. The diminishment of the
gradient at positive Z values is also evident in this ﬁgure.
Further modelling in 3D is required to understand if the
North-South diﬀerences in the gradient can be explained in
terms of resonances due to spiral structure, which one would
expect to produce eﬀects symmetric with respect to Z.

The bottom panels of Figure 12 shows the correspond-
ing Galaxia model for the red clump. Here we see that there
is an absence of the observed North-South asymmetry, and
further, we conﬁrm that the asymmetry is not produced by
using the red clump distance estimate. We have explored
the inﬂuence of changing the distances using the Zwitter
distances. We found that these alternative distance calcu-
lations also show the same overall R, Z variations for VR,
while exhibiting some diﬀerences in various regions. This
indicates that while the distances may inﬂuence the quan-

titative results, qualitatively the overall trends remain the
same.

6.3 VZ

The top panels of Figure 13 show that both proper-motion
catalogs yield a similar dependence of VZ on (R, Z). We see
a ridge of enhanced VZ that slopes across the panel, making
an angle of approximately 40◦ with the R axis and cutting
that axis at approximately the solar radius. This feature is
most pronounced in the bottom-left panel, for proper mo-
tions in the RAVE catalog. If we assume the LSR VZ value
is zero, and thus the top of the ridge has VZ = 0, we could
interpret the stars interior to this point showing an overall
rarefaction: stars below the plane move downwards, while
those above the plane, move upwards. Exterior to R = 8 kpc
the behaviour is reversed and shows a compression; below
the plane stars move upwards, while above the plane stars

move downwards. The amplitude of these variations is large;
= 17 kms−1 as seen from Figure 8.
up to

The results for the SPM4 and UCAC3 proper motions
do not exhibit quite so large an amplitude in the VZ varia-
tions, but as shown in Figure 13 for SPM4, exhibit a similar
overall behaviour, with the line of higher VZ running diag-
onal across the RZ plane. However, in Figure 8 we see that
below the plane, the alternative proper motion results do
not show the large dip in VZ at R = 9 kpc, though this is
mostly due to the smaller sampling area in the XY plane
of the alternative proper motion sources. Above the plane,
the behaviour of the results from the various proper motion
sources is similar, with clear deviation from the Galaxia
model’s predictions in the bottom panels of Figure 13. The
Galaxia model itself shows a random pattern of high and
low VZ of the order of 5 kms−1. There is some smoothing
spatially of these ﬂuctuations with the use of RC-magnitude
derived distances, though the observed pattern is not gener-
ated with this distance method. In general, the proper mo-

Figure 14. The trends in average Vφ (top), VR (middle) and VZ (bottom) as a function of (X, Y, Z) position in the Galaxy for RC
stars only using RAVE catalog proper motions. The position of the spiral arms (red lines) are also plotted.

tions dominate the calculated VZ values, and the diﬀerences
in observed structure reﬂect this. Nonetheless, it is reassur-
ing that the overall pattern is recovered in Figure 13 with
each proper motion catalog source.

Recently, Widrow et al. 2012 found with main-sequence
SDSS stars that the vertical number-density and VZ pro-
ﬁles suggest vertical waves in the Galactic disk excited by
a recent perturbation. A direct comparison with their re-
sults and ours is not possible as their stars are outside the
RAVE spatial sampling region. However, our results sup-
port this proposition: the rarefaction and compression be-
haviour seen in the top panels of Figure 13 is indicative
of wave-like behaviour. This could then be seen as further
“ringing” behaviour of the disk caused by a recent accretion
event, as in Minchev et al. 2009; Gomez et al. 2012. Indeed,
Gomez et al. 2013 further suggest that such vertical waves
may have been excited by the Sagittarius dwarf as it passed
through the disk. Their simulations ﬁnd deviations of up to
8 kms−1 in VZ in a heavy-Sgr scenario.

Turning now to Figure 14 we ﬁnd some suggestion that
the VZ ﬁeld shows some alignment with spiral-arms fea-
ture, even at signiﬁcant distances from the plane. Below
1.5 kpc is
the plane, the Sagittarius-Carina arm at X
aligned with the low VZ velocities seen with the RAVE cat-
alog proper motions for Y < 0. In this representation, the
SPM4 and UCAC3 proper motion results also show a dip in
their VZ velocities around this area, though the feature is
not as pronounced as for the RAVE catalog proper motions.
The Perseus arm is also aligned with an area of lower VZ at
X =
0.5 kpc. Across all values of Z,
the alignment of the VZ features with the spiral arms is less
clear for Y > 0, which below the plane may be explained by

1.25, Y < 0, Z <

the proximity of the Hercules thick disk cloud.Siebert et al.
2012 showed how spiral density waves could be used to ex-
plain the VR streaming motion. Siebert et al. (in prepara-
tion) goes further to investigate how they could also create
the VZ structures, coupled to VR.

200 pc for R = 8

These results suggest that there are large-scale verti-
cal movements of stars, with various cohorts at the same Z
moving in opposing directions. In Casetti et al. 2011, it was
proposed that while the Galactic warp starts at the solar
radius, the small elevations of the warp at these distances
(70
10 kpc (L´opez-Corredoira et al.
2002)) and the large distances of the RAVE stars from the
plane would mean that kinematics of stars would be little
aﬀected by the warp. In Russiel 2002, the nearby Sagittarius-
Carina arm as traced by star-forming complexes is found to
lie mostly below the plane by 100
200pc, which suggests
that nearby spiral arms can be inﬂuenced by some warp-
ing. Whether the warp is long-lived or a transient feature
would have implications for the associated velocities. The
complexity of the vertical velocity distribution suggested by
our results would tend to point towards transient features:
they suggest a non-equilibrium state. A multi-mode travel-
ling wave caused by a recent accretion event, or structure
associated with the disk’s spiral arms, would be the most
likely explanations for the observed velocity structure.

6.4 Velocity dispersion trends

The second moments of the velocity components increase
with increasing Z and decreasing R in a smooth fashion as
expected, with Figure 11 showing the results for σ(Vφ). As
for Vφ, they can be ﬁt by a simple parametric function.

eters are valid for the same ranges given in Table 4.

Figure 15 displays the trends in the dispersion of
Vφ, VR, VZ as a function of Z for 0.5 kpc thick slices in R
using 0.5 kpc bins in Z. Also plotted are the results based on
UCAC3 and SPM4 proper motions, and the Galaxia model
results using the “true” model distances plus RC-calculated
distances. Unlike the mean-value trends, the diﬀerences be-
tween the various proper motion sources is minimal. We see
however that the Galaxia model results indicate that the
use of RC-calculated distances can lead to an increase in
the measured dispersion values, particularly for VR. Inter-
estingly however, there is a reasonable agreement between
the results of Galaxia and that observed with RAVE.

We note that the dispersions were corrected for errors
following the same methodology of Casetti et al. 2011. This
method adjusts a guess of the true dispersion, σV , in velocity
component V until

The velocity dispersions exhibit linear behaviour in R
and parabolic behaviour in Z. Thus, a ﬁt to the dispersion
trends was found to be provided by the simple form

The similar coeﬃcients for each velocity component under-

7 VELOCITY GRADIENT: LINE-OF-SIGHT

DETECTION

In S11 the gradient in VR was ﬁrst investigated using the
line-of-sight velocity, Vlos, along narrow lines towards the
centre and anti-centre. The rationale for this approach was
to observe the VR gradient independent of the proper mo-
tions. The complicated 3D structure of the Galactic VR pro-
ﬁle was not considered so we revisit this approach, keeping
in mind the 3D trends.

From Equations 1 and 7 in the Appendix, we see that
if we are to consider the Vlos as representative of U (and
VR), technically it would be better to ﬁrst subtract the
so
solar motion from the line-of-sight velocity, to obtain V ′
los.
Otherwise the components above and below the plane will
be shifted from each other, which can be problematic if the
sample shifts from above-the-plane to below-the-plane, po-
tentially producing spurious trends. This was omitted in the
analysis of Figure 3 from S11, however, it did not aﬀect the
conclusions as the models were similarly shifted.

plot against R rather than d cos lcosb as this is easier to in-
terpret and there is little diﬀerence between the two values.
We plot the results with and without the LSR correction,
with the curve being ﬂattened in the latter with the removal
of the U⊙ component. We also plot the trends for a thin-
disk as in S11, using 100 Monte Carlo realizations. We see
here that not correcting for the solar motion does not aﬀect
the conclusions. Note that with the updated data sets the
VR streaming motion is slightly less apparent in both the
RC and Zwitter results than it was in S11: the model with
3 kms−1/kpc is a better ﬁt to the data. Also,
∂(VR)/∂R =
the diﬀerences between the RC and Zwitter trends around
the solar radius in Figure 16 is a result of the diﬀerent geo-
metric sampling of the two.

In Figure 17 we examine the V ′

los cos b results split into
North and South components. In this we open up the cri-
teria a bit to within 7 deg of the centre and anti-centre
direction to reduce the eﬀects of Poisson noise and make
the trends clearer. Here we see that that diﬀerences can
be discerned between the North and South trends, how-
ever, they are opposite to that seen in the previous sec-
10 kms−1/kpc)
tion; the gradient is in the North (
is stronger though absent in the South (0 kms−1/kpc)) for
R < 8 kpc. Plotting the corresponding results for VR in Fig-
ure 18, we ﬁnd that the including the proper motion results
shifts the overall values so that the northern trends are more
10 kms−1/kpc and the southern
in line with δVZ/δR =
5 kms−1/kpc. Despite the disparity with
δVZ/δR =
the actual numbers, the cause of which is discussed below,
both V ′
los cos b and the VR nonetheless exhibit diﬀerences be-
tween the north and south trends, opposite to those found
in Section 6.2.

To understand the reversal of the trends note ﬁrst that
the selected sample cuts across a range of Z as we change
R so these plots combine the R and Z trends seen previ-
ously. Second, the necessary restriction on l means that we
are sampling a very narrow beam and thus do not see the
global patterns, but only those along that beam. In Figure
14 Quadrants 3 and 4 show the largest gradient, which we
miss with the beams. Hence, these plots emphasize the 3D
nature of the VR values in the solar neighbourhood: what
you measure very much depends on where you look, be it
north or south, and at diﬀerent R and Z values.

This condition is for the most part met in the low latitudes

plots. This positive trend in VZ appears to stop just beyond
the solar circle at R
8.5 kpc. In contrast to VR above, this
behaviour is consistent with what was found in Section 6.3.
Note that the diﬀerences between the observed magni-
tude of the trends in V ′

can be explained by the fact that both V ′

components of U and W . For small l, V ′
U ′ sin b cos b + W ′ cos2 b. The
W ′ cos b sin b and V ′
−
cross-terms mean that there is some ‘leakage’ of the VZ
trends into V ′
b cos b, which work
to either diminish or enhance the observed trend in the single
component. Nonetheless, the fact that there are diﬀerences
between the north and south for the single components at
all is further evidence of the 3D variations of the velocity
values.

The VR and VZ trends, as seen via the line-of-sight ve-
locities and proper motions respectively, are unaﬀected by
potential systematics in the distances: a change of the dis-
tance scale would not aﬀect the fact that a trend is seen
at all. This is particularly so for the diﬀerences observed
between the northern and southern samples. Furthermore,
both the SPM and UCAC3 proper motions give similar re-
sults as in Figures 19, with a stark negative trend above the
plane and a positive trend below for the region R < 8.5 kpc.
Thus, neither the distances nor the proper motions intro-
duce large systematics into this method of detection.

8 CONCLUSION

−

−

−

Using RAVE red clump giants we have examined in detail
the ﬁrst moments of the velocity components in a large vol-
ume around the Sun. We ﬁnd diﬀerences between the North
and South in the streaming motion reported in Siebert et al.
2011 in Galactocentric radial velocity, VR. Above the plane,
10 kms−1 for
there is a large outward ﬂow (VR = 8
0 < Z < 1 kpc) with a shallow or non-existent gradient. Be-
low the plane, there are lower values of VR outside the solar
1 < Z <
circle, down to VR =
0.5 kpc. This is associated with a much steeper gradient in
−
R, particularly in Quadrants 3 and 4, the largest gradient
being δVR/δR =

10 kms−1 at R = 9 kpc,

8 kms−1/kpc for

1 < Z <

0.5 kpc.

The behaviour of VZ shows a surprising complexity sug-
gestive of a wave of compression and rarefaction: there is a
ridge of higher VZ passing at an angle of 40◦ to the plane,
intersecting the plane at roughly the solar radius. Assuming
the LSR VZ to be zero, stars interior to the solar circle and
above the plane are moving upwards, while those below the
plane, downwards. Exterior to the solar circle, stars both
above and below are moving on average towards the plane.

centre.

Physically, the VZ velocity ﬁeld implies alternate rar-
efaction and compression, as in a sound wave. Thus our
three-dimensional velocity ﬁeld conﬁrms the recent one-
dimensional results of Widrow et al. 2012 in which North-
South diﬀerences in the velocities of SDSS stars suggested
vertical waves in the Galactic disk. Two likely causes of these

waves are either a recently accreted satellite or the disk’s
spiral arms. Further modelling will hopefully help decide
between these two scenarios.

Vφ is much more regular than the other two compo-
nents, showing the most qualitative agreement with the
mock sample created with the Galaxia model
for the
Galaxy and the expected increase of Vφ with increasing Z
and decreasing R. The model gives a much ﬂatter proﬁle of
Vφ with Z however than the data; at Z = 0 kpc we mea-
sure Vφ values 5 kms−1 larger than Galaxia, falling to
1 kpc. There is some hint of
−
−
an increased lag in Vφ near the plane associated with spiral
arm features. We present a simple parametric ﬁt to the Vφ
dependence on R and Z.

We also trace the second moments of the velocities as
a function of R and Z, providing a simple parametric ﬁt to
these trends as well.

The red clump is increasingly being used as a standard
candle for ﬁeld stars, given its ease of identiﬁcation and the
relative insensitivity of the MK magnitude to age and metal-
licity. We modelled our selection of RC stars using Galaxia,
showing a surprisingly high level of contamination by ﬁrst-
ascent giants despite a tight selection in the log g-(J
K)
plane. However, given that the majority of these giants have
a similar magnitude to the red clump itself, the eﬀect on the
distances does not render them unusable. It means though
that there is further complexity in the metallicity-age mix-
ture of selected red clump stars: the population is by no
means homogenous in age and abundance.

−

The assumption of a single MK magnitude for the RC
and the proper motions are the largest sources of system-
atic error in our analysis. Indeed, a deeper study into proper
motion diﬀerences is required to establish which of the cat-
alogs is most trustworthy. Nevertheless, we have established
that North-South diﬀerences do exist in VR and VZ despite
these problems. For VR a line-of-sight detection, which ex-
cludes the proper motions, shows gradients above and below
the plane despite the pencil beams in this analysis pointing
away from the area of the largest gradient in Quadrants 3
and 4. These results particularly illustrate the 3D nature
of the velocity ﬁeld. For VZ, results using the three proper
motion sources give the same rarefaction-compression be-
haviour, albeit with some variation in the details.

The 3D structure in VR and VZ presents challenges to
future modelling of the Galactic disk under the inﬂuence
of the bar, spiral features and any other perturbations (be
they temporally localised or not). It is not intrinsically clear
indeed if the structure in the two are coupled or arise from
diﬀerent physical mechanisms.

APPENDIX

The peculiar motion of the Sun is given in the Cartesian values
(U⊙, V⊙, W⊙). We deﬁne the line-of-sight velocity and proper mo-
tion vectors in (l, b) co-ordinates corrected for reﬂex of the solar
motion:
V ′
V ′
V ′

los = Vlos + (U⊙ cos l cos b + V⊙ sin l cos b + W⊙ sin b),
l = Vl + (−U⊙ sin l + V⊙ cos l),
b = Vb + (−U⊙ cos l sin b − V⊙ sin l sin b + W⊙ cos b).

The reason we do the correction this way round (rather than
simply in (U, V, W )) is because we wish to see how the line-of-sight
velocities and proper motions are constituted. For example, the
Sun is moving up towards the Galactic pole. To correct for this in
the line-of-sight velocity when looking above and below the plane
this contribution from W⊙ is subtracted and added respectively.
Hence, the solar motion must be corrected for before examining
trends in Vlos, especially if averaging over positive and negative
z.

The (U, V, W ) components are given by
los cos l cos b − V ′
los sin l cos b + V ′
los sin b + V ′

U = V ′
V = V ′
W = V ′

l sin l − V ′
l cos l − V ′

b cos b,

b cos l sin b,
b sin l sin b,

where U is positive towards the Galactic centre. For small l this
reduces to

b sin b,

los cos b − V ′
U = V ′
V = V ′
l ,
los sin b + V ′
W = V ′

b cos b.

Similar results are obtained near l = 180 deg, obviously with some
sign changes. To convert to cylindrical co-ordinates we ﬁrstly de-
ﬁne the Cartesian values corrected for the circular velocity at the
solar radius;

VX = U

VY = V + Vc,0

VZ = W
