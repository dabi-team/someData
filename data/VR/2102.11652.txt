Abstract 

Studies on prospective memory (PM) predominantly assess either event- or time-based 
PM by implementing non-ecological laboratory-based tasks. The results deriving from 
these paradigms have provided findings that are discrepant with ecologically valid 
research paradigms that converge on the complexity and cognitive demands of everyday 
tasks. The Virtual Reality Everyday Assessment Lab (VR-EAL), an immersive virtual 
reality (VR) neuropsychological battery with enhanced ecological validity, was 
implemented to assess everyday event- and time-based PM, as well as the influence of 
other cognitive functions on everyday PM functioning. The results demonstrated the 
importance of delayed recognition, planning, and visuospatial attention on everyday 
PM. Delayed recognition and planning ability were found to be central in event- and 
time-based PM respectively. In order of importance, delayed recognition, visuospatial 
attention speed, and planning ability were found to be involved in event-based PM 
functioning. Comparably, planning, visuospatial attention accuracy, delayed 
recognition, and multitasking/task-shifting ability were found to be involved in time-
based PM functioning. These findings further suggest the importance of ecological 
validity in the study of PM, which may be achieved using immersive VR paradigms.

Introduction 

Prospective memory (PM) involves the ability to remember to initiate an action in the future. 
The PM action may be associated with either a certain event (i.e., event-based PM; e.g., when 
you pass the supermarket, buy a pint of milk) or a specific time (time-based PM; e.g., at 3 pm 
watch the weather forecast). PM functioning is crucial for many aspects of everyday life, 
varying from minor (e.g., brushing your teeth after having breakfast) to vital importance (e.g., 
having an insulin injection after dinner). PM impairment is common in healthy older 
individuals (Huppert, Johnson, & Nickson, 2000), as well as in clinical populations such as 
Parkinson’s disease (Kliegel, Altgassen, Hering, & Rose, 2011), individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment (Costa, Caltagirone, & Carlesimo, 2011), Alzeimer’s disease (Jones, 
Livner, & Bäckman, 2006), and autism spectrum disorder (Sheppard, Bruineberg, 
Kretschmer-Trendowicz, & Altgassen, 2018). The study of everyday PM may assist in our 
understanding of real-life PM functioning, and consequently provide ways to improve 
functioning in individuals with PM impairments.  
Cognitive functions associated with prospective memory 

The two main theoretical models of PM are the preparatory attentional and memory (PAM) 
theory and the multiprocess theory (Anderson, McDaniel, & Einstein, 2017). These two 
theoretical models have attempted to explain the implications of attentional and memory 
processes in everyday PM functioning. Based on the PAM theory, PM functioning relies on 
attentional processes for monitoring both environmental and internal cues, which may assist 
an individual in recalling their intended PM action (Smith, 2003; Smith, Hunt, McVay, & 
McConnell, 2007). The multiprocess framework suggests that passive monitoring may also 
assist in detecting target cues, resulting in reflexive associative retrieval of the intended PM 
action (McDaniel & Einstein, 2000; McDaniel & Einstein, 2007). More recently, the dynamic 
multiprocess framework has been proposed, which suggests a dynamic interplay between top-
down and bottom-up monitoring and retrieval processes for PM functioning (Scullin, 
McDaniel, & Shelton, 2013; Shelton & Scullin, 2017). The dynamic multiprocess framework 
emphasises the importance of contextual information and/or formulating an effective plan of 
action in PM functioning (Scullin et al., 2013; Shelton & Scullin, 2017). Contextual 
information may indicate the probability of detecting a target cue related to the intended PM 
action in the current environment (Marsh, Hicks, & Cook, 2008; Scullin et al., 2013; Shelton 
& Scullin, 2017). In addition, an effective plan of action is facilitated by associating potential 
environmental cues with the intended PM action (Scullin et al., 2013; Shelton & Scullin, 
2017).  

The formulation of an effective plan of action is based on Gollwitzer’s implementation 
intention, which is an encoding technique for future actions by associating a cue with the 
intended action (i.e., “if I encounter X then I will do Y”; Gollwitzer, 1999). Planning ability, 
an executive function, involves thinking about the future, organizing and prioritizing future 
actions (Miyake et al., 2000; Morris & Ward, 2004). In everyday life, planning defines when 
and where an action will take place, and updates/prioritises the plan of action based on the 
received information (e.g., I received a letter notifying me of my overdue electricity bill, so, 
tomorrow I will need pay it after work; Morris & Ward, 2004). Indeed, effective planning has 

been found to improve PM functioning (Azzopardi, Auffray, & Kermarrec, 2017; Gonneaud 
et al., 2011; Liu & Park, 2004; McDaniel & Scullin, 2010; McFarland & Glisky, 2009; Milne, 
Orbell, & Sheeran, 2002; Mioni & Stablum, 2014; Vanneste, Baudouin, Bouazzaoui, & 
Taconnat, 2016; Zuber, Mahy, & Kliegel, 2019). Another executive function which is often 
found to contribute to PM functioning is task-shifting (Azzopardi et al., 2017; Gonneaud et 
al., 2011; McFarland & Glisky, 2009; Mioni & Stablum, 2014; Vanneste et al., 2016; Zuber et 
al., 2019). Task-shifting pertains to the ability to inhibit one’s attention on the current task, 
and shift it to another task (Miyake et al., 2000).  

However, as mentioned above, everyday PM consists of both event- and time-based PM 

(Einstein & McDaniel, 1996). Hence, including only event-based tasks in the assessment of 
PM does not allow for generalisation of the results to PM functioning in the daily life (e.g., 
Einstein, Smith, McDaniel, & Shaw, 1997; Einstein, McDaniel, Manzi, Cochran, & Baker, 
2000; Mullet, Scullin, Hess, Scullin, Arnold, & Einstein, 2013; Scullin, McDaniel, Shelton, & 
Lee, 2010; Smith, 2003; Smith et al., 2007). Time-based tasks may have similar aspects to 
event-based tasks (e.g., a cue which reminds an individual of the intended PM action), but 
they significantly differ in other aspects (Glickson, & Myslobodsky, 2006; Zuber et al., 
2019). A key difference is the requirement to monitor the time in time-based tasks (Glickson, 
& Myslobodsky, 2006; Zuber et al., 2019). However, individuals do not appear to constantly 
monitor time. Instead, the most common behaviour is to monitor time strategically (Cona, 
Arcara, Tarantino, & Bisiacchi, 2012; Kliegel, Martin, McDaniel, & Einstein, 2001).  By 
implementing strategic time monitoring, individuals check the time and then estimate when 
they should check it again, and adjust correspondingly the frequency of their monitoring 
(Cona et al., 2012; Kliegel et al., 2001).   

The importance of ecological validity 

Evidence for the role of attentional, memory, and executive functioning processes in PM 
functioning derives predominantly from experiments which have implemented laboratory 
tasks. These laboratory tasks incorporate simple, static stimuli within a highly controlled 
environment, which do not resemble the complexity of real-life situations (Parsons, 2015).  
For example, a PM laboratory experiment may incorporate a single on-going task such as a 
computerised lexical decision task where the participant should indicate whether the presented 
word is a real or fictional word, together with a comparable computerised PM task, where the 
participant should indicate when a specific word appears. Hence, the laboratory tasks 
incorporate a simple testing environment (e.g., two-dimensional) and stimuli (e.g., static), 
with almost automatic responses (i.e., in milliseconds) provided using a keyboard, a relatively 
short testing duration (e.g., 15 minutes) and delay from encoding the PM intention (e.g., up to 
10 minutes), and a single on-going task and a PM task with low demands. 

Importantly, the implementation of non-ecologically valid PM tasks may provide 

discrepant results compared to ecologically valid research paradigms (Marsh, Hicks, & 
Landau, 1998). Ecologically valid tasks substantially converge with the complexity and 
cognitive demands of corresponding everyday tasks (Chaytor & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003; 
Franzen & Wilhelm, 1996; Spooner & Pachana, 2006), which allows the findings to be 
generalised to everyday functioning (Chaytor & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003; Haines et al., 

2019; Higginson, Arnett, & Voss, 2000; Mlinac & Feng, 2016; Parsons, 2015; Phillips, 
Henry, & Martin, 2008). The implementation of ecologically valid tasks is therefore required 
to examine the role of attentional, memory, and executive functioning processes in everyday 
PM functioning.  
Naturalistic Experiments 
Ecologically valid research paradigms have predominantly involved assessments in real-life 
settings such as performing errands in a shopping centre or a pedestrianized street (e.g., 
Garden, Phillips, & MacPherson, 2001; Marsh et al., 1998; Shallice & Burgess, 1991). In PM 
research, these naturalistic experiments do not tend to consider diverse types of PM tasks 
within the same paradigm. The most replicated discrepancy between the findings from 
laboratory and naturalistic tasks is the so-called age-prospective-memory-paradox 
(Kvavilashvili, Cockburn, & Kornbrot, 2013; Niedźwieńska & Barzykowski, 2012; Phillips et 
al., 2008; Uttl, 2008). In laboratory tasks, there are significant age-related differences on both 
event-based and time-based tasks between younger and older adults, while in naturalistic 
tasks, older adults perform at least comparably to younger adults (Kvavilashvili et al., 2013; 
Niedźwieńska & Barzykowski, 2012; Phillips et al., 2008; Uttl, 2008). This paradox may be 
attributed to factors such as individual differences (Phillips et al., 2008; Shelton & Scullin, 
2017; Uttl, 2008) in the use of compensatory strategies and external memory aids, which are 
common strategies in daily life for performing PM tasks (Phillips et al., 2008; Uttl, 2008).  
However, real-world tasks suffer from several limitations such as an inability to be 

standardized for use in other clinics or laboratories, reduced feasibility with certain 
neurological populations (e.g., schizophrenia patients), augmented time, fiscal, procedural and 
bureaucratic demands, as well as diminished experimental control over external factors 
(Parsons, 2015). An example of diminished control can be seen in the study of Niedźwieńska 
and Barzykowski (2012) where the scoring was dichotomous in terms of 0 or 1, without 
considering other factors (e.g., using external aids) that assist in performing PM tasks, and 
this may have caused ceiling effects.  
Virtual Reality 
An alternative approach to achieve ecological validity is the implementation of non-
immersive virtual environments, which are able to simulate real-life tasks, are cost-effective, 
require less administration time, enable increased experimental control, and can be 
implemented in other clinical or research settings (Parsons, McMahan, & Kane, 2018; Werner 
& Korczyn, 2012; Zygouris & Tsolaki, 2015). However, non-immersive virtual reality (VR) 
tasks can be difficult for individuals without gaming backgrounds (e.g., competency in using 
a keyboard and mouse to interact with the virtual environment; Zaidi, Duthie, Carr, & 
Maksoud, 2018) and they are substantially less ecologically valid than immersive VR tests 
(Parsons et al., 2018; Rizzo, Schultheis, Kerns, & Mateer, 2004). On the other hand, 
immersive VR tests benefit from the same advantages as non-immersive ones, but they also 
benefit from enhanced ecologically validity (Bohil, Alicea, & Biocca, 2011; Parsons, 2015; 
Rizzo et al., 2004; Teo et al., 2016). Notably, the first-person view and ergonomic/naturalistic 
interactions within immersive VR environments are proximal to real-life actions, as a result 
they significantly alleviate the differences in performance between gamers and non-gamers 
(Zaidi et al., 2018). Therefore, an immersive VR research paradigm appears be the most 
efficient approach to study everyday PM functioning. 

  
The Virtual Reality Everyday Assessment Lab 
The Virtual Reality Everyday Assessment Lab (VR-EAL) was recently developed as an 
immersive VR neuropsychological battery assessing everyday cognitive functions such as PM 
(i.e., event-based and time-based), episodic memory (i.e., immediate and delayed 
recognition), attentional processes (i.e., visual, visuospatial, and auditory), and executive 
functioning (i.e., planning and task-shifting abilities; Kourtesis, Korre, Collina, Doumas, & 
MacPherson, 2020b). The convergent, construct, and ecological validity of the VR-EAL has 
been examined against established ecologically valid paper-and-pencil tests including the 
Cambridge Prospective Memory Test (Wilson et al., 2005), the Rivermead Behavioral 
Memory Test–III (Wilson, Cockburn, & Baddeley, 2008), the Test of Everyday Attention 
(Robertson, Ward, Ridgeway, & Nimmo-Smith, 1996), and the Behavioral Assessment of 
Dysexecutive Syndrome (Wilson, Alderman, Burgess, Emslie, & Evans, 1997; Kourtesis, 
Collina, Doumas, & MacPherson, 2020a). Importantly, there is no performance difference in 
the VR-EAL between gamers and non-gamers. Also, participants rated the VR-EAL scenarios 
and tasks as significantly more similar to everyday tasks than the equivalent ecologically valid 
paper-and-pencil tasks (Kourtesis et al., 2020a).  

Hence, the VR-EAL appears to better resemble the complexity and cognitive demands 
of real-life tasks, as well as assessing both event- and time-based PM, and cognitive processes 
(i.e., attentional, memory, and executive functioning) which have been found to be associated 
with PM functioning. The VR-EAL is significantly closer to real life situations due to 
attributes such as the complexity and synthesis of the environment (i.e., a realistic and 
complex 360o environment), the quality of the stimuli (i.e., dynamic and realistic), the 
duration of the experiment (i.e., approximately 70 minutes), the naturalistic and ergonomic 
interactions within the testing environment, the response type (i.e., naturalistic) and time (i.e., 
in seconds), the length of the delay between encoding the PM intention and performing the 
PM action (i.e., 15 – 60 minutes), as well as including several cognitively demanding ongoing 
and PM tasks. 
The current study 
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the cognitive functions that are 
involved in everyday event- and time-based PM functioning using an ecologically valid 
immersive VR paradigm in a single sample. As discussed above, the relevant literature 
postulates that attentional, memory, and executive processes are implicated in PM 
functioning. Thus, we hypothesize that attention, memory, and/or executive functioning will 
be involved in everyday PM functioning. However, since ecologically valid and laboratory 
paradigms does not provide convergent findings, we expect that the implementation of an 
ecologically valid assessment may indicate the increased importance of certain cognitive 
functions (e.g., delayed recognition, visuospatial attention, and planning), while it may 
decrease the importance of other cognitive functions (e.g., immediate recognition, visual 
attention, and multitasking).  In terms of delayed recognition, the VR-EAL scenario lasts 
approximately 70 minutes which allows one to investigate the importance of recognising a 
cue after a long delay. Also, the inclusion of several diverse everyday tasks (PM and non-PM) 
within a realistic scenario may indicate the importance of prioritising activities (i.e., planning 
ability) in real life PM. Furthermore, the VR-EAL activities are performed in a naturalistic 
way, which substantially differ from the almost immediate responses in laboratory paradigms 

(i.e., reaction times in milliseconds). Hence, allowing the examinee to perform the tasks in a 
naturalistic way (e.g., in seconds) may reveal the decreased importance of multitasking/task-
shifting ability in everyday PM functioning. Finally, the VR-EAL scenario takes place within 
a complex, dynamic, and immersive 360o environment, hence, the importance of visuospatial 
attention processes (i.e., directing attention to a specific area of the environment and 
identifying items of interest within this specific area) may be seen as more important than 
visual attention processes (i.e., identifying items of interest within the visual field). 

Methods 

Participants and Procedure 

Participants were recruited via social media and the internal mailing list of the University of 
Edinburgh and were the same cohort as in Kourtesis et al. (2020a). Forty-one participants (21 
females) with a mean age of 29.15 years (SD = 5.80, range = 18-45) and mean education of 
13.80 years (SD = 2.36, range = 10-16) were recruited. The study was approved by the 
Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences Research Ethics Committee of the University 
of Edinburgh. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. All participants 
received verbal and written instructions regarding the procedures, possible adverse effects of 
immersive VR (e.g., cybersickness), utilization of the data, and general aims of the study. The 
participants attended the session individually. Upon their arrival, they were instructed by the 
examiner how to use the VR equipment. Then the participants were immersed into the VR-
EAL, where they had a practice period without time restrictions to get familiarised with the 
basic controls and configuration. When the participants felt comfortable interacting within the 
virtual environment of VR-EAL, the VR-EAL’s scenario commenced. All participants 
completed all tasks (i.e., non-PM and PM) and the full VR-EAL scenario. After exposure to 
VR, the Virtual Reality Neuroscience Questionnaire (VRNQ; Kourtesis, Collina, Doumas, 
&MacPherson, 2019b) was administered to assess cybersickness symptomatology.   

Materials 

Hardware 

An HTC Vive HMD with two lighthouse stations for motion tracking and two HTC Vive 
wands with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) for navigation and interactions within the virtual 
environment were implemented in accordance with our previously published technological 
recommendations for immersive VR research (Kourtesis, Collina, Doumas, & MacPherson, 
2019a). The spatialized (bi-aural) audio was facilitated by a pair of Senhai Kotion Each 
G9000 headphones. The size of the VR area was 5m2, which provides an adequate space for 
immersion and naturalistic interaction within virtual environments (Borrego, Latorre, Alcañiz, 
& Llorens, 2018). The HMD was connected to a laptop with an Intel Core i7 7700HQ 
2.80GHz processor, 16 GB RAM, a 4095MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card, a 
931 GB TOSHIBA MQ01ABD100 (SATA) hard disk, and Realtek High Definition Audio. 

VR-EAL 

VR-EAL assesses everyday cognitive functions such as PM, episodic memory (i.e., 
immediate and delayed recognition), executive functioning (i.e., planning, multitasking) and 
selective visual, visuospatial and auditory (bi-aural) attention within a realistic immersive VR 
scenario lasting around 70 minutes (Kourtesis et al., 2020a). See Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2 
for a summary of the VR-EAL tasks assessing each cognitive ability. Also, a brief video

Prospective Memory. VR-EAL considers both event-based and time-based PM tasks. The PM 
tasks are divided into five event-based tasks and four time-based tasks. In the event-based 
tasks, the participant should remember to perform a PM action when a specific event occurs 
(e.g., take medicines after breakfast). In the time-based tasks, the examinee should remember 
to perform a planned action at a specific time (e.g., call Rose at 12 pm). The following is a 
scoring example. At the end of a scene, the examinees should press a button to confirm that 
all the tasks in the scene have been completed. If the examinees have already taken their 
medication (i.e., PM task) before pressing the final button, then the scene ends, and the 
examinees receive 6 points. Otherwise, the first prompt appears (i.e., “You Have to Do 
Something Else”). If the examinees then follow the prompt and take their medication, they 
receive 4 points. If the examinees press the final button again, then the second prompt appears 
(i.e., “You Have to Do Something After Having your Breakfast”). If the examinees follow 
this prompt and take their medication, they receive 2 points. If the examinees press the final 
button again, then the third prompt appears (i.e., “You Have to Take Your Meds”). If the 
examinees follow this prompt and take their medication, they then receive 1 point. If the 
examinees repress the final button without ever taking their medication, they get zero points, 
and the scene ends. Scores range from 0 to 6. 

There are also two misleading tasks. One is related to an event (i.e., event-based) and 
the other to a specific time (i.e., time-based). However, in the misleading tasks, the examinee 
should respond negatively to the virtual human prompts to perform a task because there is not 
a task to perform. The misleading tasks serve two purposes. The first is deception to examine 
whether the examinee is simply responding affirmatively to all PM task prompts. If the 
examinee responds affirmatively, then s/he loses points (see Table 1). The second is that these 
false prompts are common in everyday life (e.g., a friend invites you to watch an episode of a 
TV series together, but you decline because you remember that the episode will be aired 
tomorrow and not today). Hence, their inclusion increases the ecological validity of VR-EAL.  

Episodic Memory. Both immediate and delayed episodic memory are assessed. Firstly, 

the participant needs to memorize a shopping list which is presented audio-visually. 
Immediately after the presentation of the list, the participant is presented with 30 grocery 
items (i.e., immediate recognition). The examinee should choose the ten target items (i.e., 
create the shopping list) from an extensive array of items, which also contains five qualitative 
distractors (e.g., semi-skimmed milk versus skimmed milk), five quantitative distractors (e.g., 
1 kg potatoes versus 2 kg potatoes), and ten false items (e.g., bread, bananas etc.). Similarly, 
the participant should choose the same 10 items when they arrive at the supermarket 
approximately 20 minutes later (delayed recognition). The examinee gains 2 points for each 
correctly chosen item, 1 point for selecting a qualitative or quantitative distractor, and 0 points 
for the false items. Scores range from 0 to 20. 

Multitasking/Task-Shifting. The ability to multitask is examined using a cooking task, 
where the participant should prepare and serve his or her breakfast (e.g., sausages, omelette, 
and a cup of tea/coffee) and place a chocolate pie in the oven. Scoring relies on the 
animations from each game object (i.e., the omelette and the sausages). At the beginning of 
the animation, both items have a reddish (raw) colour which gradually turns to either a 

 
    
yellowish (omelette) or brownish (sausages) colour, and finally both turn to black (burnt). The 
score for each pan depends on the time that the examinee removes the pan from the stove and 
places the pan on the kitchen worktop. Equally, the score for boiling the kettle is measured in 
relation to the stage of the audio playback (e.g., the kettle whistles when the water is ready) 
when the kettle is placed on the kitchen worktop. Scores range from 0 to 16. 

Planning. Planning ability is assessed by asking participants to draw their route around the 
city (e.g., visiting the bakery, supermarket, library, and returning home) on a 3D interactive 
board. The road system comprises 23 street units. When the examinee selects a unit, 1 point is 
awarded. The ideal route to visit all three destinations is 15 units; hence, any extra or missing 
units are subtracted from the total possible score of 15. Up to 4 more points are awarded for 
the time taken to complete the task. Scores range from 0 to 19. 

Visuospatial attention. Visuospatial attention is assessed by asking the participant to find and 
collect 6 specific items (i.e., a mobile phone, a £50 note, a library card, the flat keys, a red 
book, and car keys) from the living-room. A reminder of these items remains on the wall (i.e., 
the items are displayed as 3D objects with labels). However, there are also distractors (i.e., 
magazines, books, a remote control, a notebook, a pencil, a chessboard, and a bottle of wine) 
in the room. The examinee receives 2 point for each target item collected (6 target items). 
Also, up to 4 points are awarded for the speed of detecting the items. If the examinee attempts 
to collect one of the distractors, it counts as an error. Up to 4 points are awarded for the 
accuracy of detecting items. Scores range from 0 to 20. 

Visual attention. Visual attention is measured while the participant is seated as a passenger in 
a car next to a driver. The participant should identify all the targets (i.e., 16 posters of a radio 
station) on both sides of the road, while s/he needs to avoid any distractors (i.e., 8 posters that 
are a different shape and 8 posters with a different background colour). The examinee is 
awarded 1 point when a target poster is “spotted” and subtracted 1 point when a distractor 
poster is “spotted”. Scores range from 0 to 16. 

Auditory Attention. Auditory attention is also examined while the participant is seated as a 
passenger next to a driver. The participant should detect all the target sounds (i.e., 16 bell 
sounds) presented on both sides of the road, while avoiding the distractor sounds (i.e., 8 high 
pitch bells, and 8 dongs). If the examinee presses the trigger on the right controller to detect a 
target sound originating on the right side (i.e., controller and sound on the same side), then 
s/he gets 2 points. If the examinee presses the trigger on the right controller to detect a target 
sound originating on the left side (i.e., controller on the opposite side), s/he gains only 1 point. 
If the examinee responds to a distractor sound, irrelevant of its origin or the controller used to 
respond, 1 point is deducted. Scores range from 0 to 32. 

Statistical Analyses 

All the statistical analyses were conducted using R language (R Core Team, 2020) in 

RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020). The stats (R Core Team, 2020) and the car (Fox & Weisberg, 

 
 
 
 
2019) packages were used for conducting the linear regression analyses and the diagnostics. 
The pwr package (Champely, 2020) was used to perform the statistical power analysis for 
each model. The ggstatsplot package (Patil, 2018) was used for visualising the results.  

Linear regression analyses 

The normality assumption for the event- and time-based scores was examined using the 
Shapiro-Wilk Normality test. The Non-Constant Error Variance test was used to check the 
homoscedasticity assumption for the models. The variance inflation factor for each model’s 
predictors was calculated and checked to detect multicollinearity. A statistical power analysis 
was conducted for each model. Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate 
which everyday cognitive functions predict everyday PM functioning. The models were 
compared by conducting analyses of variance. The criteria for the comparisons between the 
models were the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), the F statistic and its significance 
level, the variance explained (i.e., R2), and the statistical power of each model. 

1st step. Initially, 9 separate models were created, each with a single cognitive 
predictor. The 9 models were compared against one another. The best model among them was 
then used to build the models in the next step.  

2nd step. In this step, another 8 models were created, each with two cognitive 

predictors. In each model, the first predictor was the predictor from the best model in the 
previous step. The other predictor was one of the other cognitive function scores. These 8 
models were then compared against each other. The best model was then compared to the best 
model from the previous step. If the best model from the current step was better than the best 
model from the previous step, then the predictors of the best model from the current step were 
used to build the models in the next step. 

Following steps. The procedure described above was continued until the best model 
from the previous step was better than the best model from the current step. Then, the best 
model from the previous step was accepted as the best final model.  

Results 

The majority of participants reported no cybersickness symptoms (i.e., nausea, dizziness, 
disorientation, fatigue, or instability), while no one reported cybersickness symptoms stronger 
than a mild feeling, which postulates that cybersickness symptoms did not affect the 
participants’ performance. The descriptive statistics for the VR-EAL scores are displayed in 
Table 2. The Shapiro-Wilk Normality test yielded non-significant results for both the event-
based (p = .106) and time-based (p =.179) scores, postulating that the event- and time-based 
scores were normally distributed. Equally, the results of the Non-Constant Error Variance test 
for each model were not significant, indicating that each model’s residuals were 
homogeneous. The variance inflation factors for the models’ predictors varied from 1 – 1.6, 
suggesting an absence of multicollinearity.

functioning is significant. The model explained 32% of the variance and it had a substantially

Discussion 

This study aimed to examine the cognitive functions implicated in everyday PM functioning 
using immersive VR. The findings show that delayed recognition and planning ability 
significantly predict event- and time-based PM functioning respectively. The final models 
included delayed recognition, visuospatial attention speed, and planning ability for event-
based PM functioning and planning, visuospatial attention accuracy, delayed recognition, and 
multitasking/task-shifting ability for time-based PM functioning. These findings highlight the 
importance of attention, memory, and executive functioning in everyday PM functioning.  

Event-based prospective memory 

Delayed recognition explained some of the variance in event-based everyday PM functioning. 
This is in line with previous lab-based studies that have demonstrated that memory processes 
influence PM functioning (e.g., Smith, 2003; Smith et al., 2007; McDaniel & Einstein, 2000, 
2007). The current findings indicate similarities with episodic memory, where better memory 
encoding and maintenance (i.e., in this case the PM intended intention) facilitates more 

 
 
efficient retrieval (Frankland, Josselyn, & Köhler, 2019; Tulving, 1983; Tulving & Thomson, 
1973; Xue, 2018). In PM, the association between an X PM cue and Y PM action appear to 
facilitate better encoding as well as maintenance of the intended PM action (Gonneaud et al., 
2011; McDaniel & Scullin, 2010; Zuber et al., 2019), which highlights the role of delayed 
recognition in everyday event-based PM functioning. Indeed, Gonneaud and collaborators 
(2011) found that retrospective processes are significant in event-based PM functioning, but 
they are of secondary importance in time-based PM.  

Furthermore, the inclusion of visuospatial attention speed (i.e., the ability to select and scan 
an area of interest to detect an item of interest) in our event-based PM model emphasizes the 
importance of contextual information in PM functioning. Again, this supports previous 
findings (e.g., Marsh, et al., 2008; Scullin et al., 2013; Shelton & Scullin, 2017). It is also in 
line with the dynamic multiprocess framework, where attentional processes are implemented 
for contextual information and/or the plan of action (Scullin et al., 2013; Shelton & Scullin, 
2017). In our best model for event-based PM functioning, both visuospatial attention speed 
and planning ability were included. Visuospatial attention speed may indicate the ability to 
rapidly scan the surrounding environment to retrieve information, which may be valuable for 
informing and/or updating the formulated plan of action. In line with our findings, the 
findings of several studies have postulated the role of planning in event-based PM (e.g., 
Gonneaud et al., 2011; McDaniel & Scullin, 2010; Zuber, Kliegel, & Ihle, 2016; Zuber et al., 
2019).  

Time-based prospective memory 

Planning ability was found to explain a substantial amount of the variance in time-based PM 
functioning. This highlights the important role of planning ability in time-based PM 
functioning, which is in line with previous studies that have also demonstrated that planning 
influences time-based PM (e.g., Azzopardi et al., 2017; Liu & Park, 2004; McFarland & 
Glisky, 2009; Mioni & Stablum, 2014; Vanneste et al., 2016). Beyond formulating an 
effective plan of action, the inclusion of planning may also indicate the importance of 
strategic time monitoring, which avoids the cognitively demanding task of constantly time 
monitoring (Cona et al., 2012; Kliegel et al., 2001). In strategic time monitoring, when 
individuals check the time, they estimate when they should check it again based on a 
predefined plan of action, and adjust correspondingly the frequency of time monitoring (Cona 
et al., 2012; Kliegel et al., 2001).  

Similarly, the involvement of visuospatial attention accuracy in time-based PM may 

be an indication of effective time monitoring. In VR-EAL, the watch is attached to the left 
hand/controller of the participant which is accessible at all stages of the scenario (see scene 10 
in Figure 1). Most of the time, the watch is not within the participant’s view (see Figures 1 
and 2). Time monitoring requires the participant to detect and focus on the watch. 
Consequently, visuospatial attention accuracy highlights the crucial role of time monitoring in 
time-based PM functioning (McFarland & Glisky, 2009; Mioni & Stablum, 2014; Vanneste et 
al., 2016).  However, this finding may also indicate the importance of contextual information 
in time-based PM functioning. For example, the detection of a medication bottle may remind 

the individual that s/he needs to take her/his medicine at a specific time. This contextual 
information may assist the individual in implementing strategic time monitoring, as well as 
maintaining the PM intention.     

The delayed recognition was also included in the time-based PM model, which 
supports previous findings, where episodic memory was implicated in time-based PM 
functioning (e.g., Mackinlay, Kliegel, & Mäntylä, 2009; McFarland & Glisky, 2009). 
However, the effect of delayed recognition was not significant, which indicates that its role in 
our model appears to be supplementary, as was previously seen in Gonneaud and 
collaborators (2011). Finally, the inclusion of task-shifting in the best model of time-based 
PM appears to be in accordance with the findings (e.g., Azzopardi et al., 2017; Gonneaud et 
al., 2011; McFarland & Glisky, 2009; Mioni & Stablum, 2014; Vanneste et al., 2016; Zuber et 
al., 2019). However, in our study, task-shifting did not appear to have an important effect on 
time-based PM functioning. Its inclusion in the best model may have a secondary role, and 
indicate the ability to inhibit the task at hand, and shift attention towards time monitoring.   

Ecological Validity 

As previously suggested, the implementation of lab-based, non-ecological PM paradigms may 
provide findings which are discrepant with the findings of ecologically valid research 
paradigms (Marsh et al., 1998). This has been further supported by the so-called age-
prospective memory-paradox where significant age-related differences were found on 
laboratory PM tasks, while they were not found with ecologically valid PM tasks 
(Kvavilashvili et al., 2013; Niedźwieńska & Barzykowski, 2012; Phillips et al., 2008; Uttl, 
2008). These discrepancies may be attributed to the use of compensatory strategies and 
external memory aids, which are common strategies in daily life for performing PM tasks 
(Phillips et al., 2008; Uttl, 2008). Our findings further support the necessity for adopting 
ecologically valid paradigms to study everyday PM functioning.  

In our current study, the implementation of a long-lasting scenario (i.e., approximately 
70 minutes) demonstrated the importance of recognising a cue after a long delay (i.e., delayed 
recognition), especially for event-based PM. Importantly, the VR-EAL attempts to simulate a 
common day in the real-world. The inclusion of several everyday tasks (e.g., preparing 
breakfast, shopping, finding the keys, transporting, interacting with others, and taking meds) 
highlighted the importance of prioritising the activities (i.e., planning ability) in everyday PM 
functioning, especially for time-based PM. Furthermore, the implementation of a complex, 
dynamic, and immersive 360o environment appeared to highlight the importance of 
visuospatial attention processes in everyday PM functioning, while the simple visual attention 
processes did not appear crucial. Lastly, enabling participants to perform the VR-EAL tasks 
through ergonomic and naturalistic ways seemed to diminish the importance of 
multitasking/task-shifting ability in PM functioning, as has been previously seen in laboratory 
paradigms. Our findings, hence, postulate the importance of ecological validity for examining 
PM functioning and generalising the findings to daily life. Also, our findings suggest the 
importance of cognitive abilities in everyday PM functioning, such as episodic memory, 
visuospatial attention, and planning, which were either undermined (e.g., delayed recognition 
and planning) or not even considered (e.g., visuospatial attention) in non-ecologically valid 

 
laboratory paradigms, where the duration is short (e.g., 5-15 minutes), there is only a single or 
small number of tasks, and the testing environment is simple and limited (e.g., 90 - 180o field 
of view). The role and importance of these cognitive functions should be further studied in 
future ecologically valid studies.    
Limitations and future studies 

Our study has some limitations. The sample size was relatively small, although it 

allowed us to perform sound statistical analyses with high statistical power. Future studies 
should include a larger population which would allow a factorial analysis involving the 
components of PM. Also, our participants were only young adults. A more diverse population 
including both younger and older adults may help to elucidate the effect of aging on PM 
assessed using the VR-EAL. VR-EAL also has the limitation that it cannot measure time 
monitoring and this should be integrated into a future version of the VR-EAL. Furthermore, 
while simulations of everyday life like the VR-EAL are suitable for the investigation of real-
life PM, they may be susceptible to confounding factors, such as environmental stimuli (e.g., 
a building with several signs) or an interaction with a 3D character (i.e., the requirement of 
communicational skills), which were not experimentally controlled. Laboratory tasks have the 
advantage of isolating confounding factors and allowing the examination of specific 
processes. However, laboratory PM tasks in their current form suffer from limitations such as 
a two-dimensional environment, keyboard-based responses, static stimuli, and a lack of 
realism. A solution would be the modernization of laboratory tasks using immersive VR 
technology, which would reduce the divergence from real-life conditions, and enable a 
meticulous examination of PM and the role of other cognitive functions in everyday PM 
functioning.  

Conclusions 

 The findings of this study demonstrated the importance of delayed recognition, planning, and 
visuospatial attention in everyday PM. Delayed recognition and planning ability were found 
to be especially crucial in event- and time-based PM respectively. In order of importance, 
delayed recognition, visuospatial attention speed, and planning ability were found to be 
involved in event-based PM functioning. Comparably, planning, visuospatial attention 
accuracy, delayed recognition, and multitasking/task-shifting ability were found to be 
involved in time-based PM functioning. These findings further suggest the importance of 
ecological validity in the study of PM, which may be achieved using immersive VR 
paradigms.
