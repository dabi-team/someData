ON VIETORIS–RIPS COMPLEXES (WITH SCALE 3) OF HYPERCUBE
GRAPHS

SAMIR SHUKLA

Abstract. For a metric space (X, d) and a scale parameter r ≥ 0, the Vietoris-Rips complex
VR(X; r) is a simplicial complex on vertex set X, where a ﬁnite set σ ⊆ X is a simplex if and
only if diameter of σ is at most r. For n ≥ 1, let In denotes the n-dimensional hypercube graph.
In this paper, we show that VR(In; r) has non trivial reduced homology only in dimensions 4
and 7. Therefore, we answer a question posed by Adamaszek and Adams recently.

A (ﬁnite) simplicial complex ∆ is d-collapsible if it can be reduced to the void complex by
repeatedly removing a face of size at most d that is contained in a unique maximal face of ∆.
The collapsibility number of ∆ is the minimum integer d such that ∆ is d-collapsible. We show
that the collapsibility number of VR(In; r) is 2r for r ∈ {2, 3}.

1. Introduction

For a metric space (X, d) and a scale parameter r ≥ 0, the Vietoris-Rips complex VR(X; r)
is a simplicial complex on vertex set X, where a ﬁnite set σ ⊆ X is a simplex if and only if
diameter of σ is at most r, i.e., VR(X; r) = {σ ⊆ X : |σ| < ∞ and d(x, y) ≤ r ∀ x, y ∈ σ},
here | · | denotes the cardinality of a set. The Vietoris-Rips complex was ﬁrst introduced by
Vietoris [37] to deﬁne a homology theory for metric spaces and independently re-introduced
by E. Rips for studying the hyperbolic groups, where it has been popularised as Rips-complex
[26, 27]. The idea behind introducing these complexes was to create a ﬁnite simplicial model
for metric spaces. The Vietoris-Rips complex and its homology have become an important
tools in the applications of algebraic topology. In topological data analysis, it has been used
to analyse data with persistent homology [10, 14, 41, 42]. These complexes have been used
heavily in computational topology, as a simplicial model for point-cloud data [15, 16, 17, 20]
and as simplicial completions of communication links in sensor networks [21, 22, 36]. For more
on these complexes, the interested reader is referred to [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 18, 25, 33, 38, 39].

Consider any graph G as a metric space, where the distance between any two vertices is the
length of a shortest path among them. The study of Vietoris-Rips complexes of hypercube
graphs was initiated by Adamaszek and Adams in [3]. These questions on hypercubes arose
from work by Kevin Emmett, Ra´ul Rabad´an, and Daniel Rosenbloom related to the persistent
homology formed from genetic trees, reticulate evolution, and medial recombination [23, 24].

For a positive integer n, let In denotes the n-dimensional hypercube graph (see Deﬁnition 2.2).
In [3], Adamaszek and Adams proved that VR(In; 2) is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of
spheres of dimension 3. By using a computer calculation they proved the following.
Proposition 1.1. [3] Let 5 ≤ n ≤ 7 and 0 ≤ i ≤ 7. Then ˜Hi(VR(In; 3); Z) 6= 0 if and only if
i ∈ {4, 7}.

Further, they asked, in what homological dimensions do the Vietoris-Rips complexes VR(In; 3)
have nontrivial reduced homology? It is easy to check that the complexes VR(In; 3) are con-
tractible for 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 and VR(I4; 3) ≃ S7. In this paper we prove the following.
Theorem A. Let n ≥ 5. Then ˜Hi(VR(In; 3); Z) 6= 0 if and only if i ∈ {4, 7}.

Let ∆ be a (ﬁnite) simplicial complex. Let γ ∈ ∆ such that |γ| ≤ d and σ ∈ ∆ is the only
maximal simplex that contains γ. An elementry d-collapse of ∆ is the simplicial complex ∆′

from ∆ to the void complex ∅. Clearly, if ∆ is d-collapsible and d < c, then ∆ is c-collapsible.
The collapsibility number of ∆ is the minimal integer d such that ∆ is d-collapsible.

The notion of d-collapsibility of simplicial complexes was introduced in [40]. In combinatorial
topology it is an important problem to determine the collapsibility number or bounds for the
collapsibility number of a simplicial complex and it has been widely studied (see [12, 19, 31, 34,
35]). A simple consequence of d-collapsibility is the following:

Proposition 1.2. [40]
complex of dimension smaller than d.

If X is d-collapsible then it is homotopy equivalent to a simplicial

Recently, Bigdeli and Faridi gave a connection between the d-collapsibility and the chordal
complexes; and proved that d-collapsibility is equivalent to the chordality of the Stanley-Reisner
complexes of certain ideals [11]. For applications regarding Helly-type theorems, see [9, 29, 30].
One of the consequences of the topological colorful Helly theorem [30, Theorem 2.1] is the
following.

Proposition 1.3. [19, Theorem 1.1] Let X be a d-collapsible simplicial complex on vertex set
V , and let X c = {σ ⊆ V : σ /∈ X}. Then, every collection of d + 1 sets in X c has a rainbow set
belonging to X c.

In this paper we prove the following.

Theorem B. For n ≥ 3, the collapsibility number of VR(In; 2) is 4.

Theorem C. For n ≥ 4, the collapsibility number of VR(In; 3) is 8.

Flow of the paper: In the following Section, we list out various deﬁnitions on graph theory
and simplicial complexes that are used in this paper. We also ﬁx a few notations, which we use
throughout this paper. In Section 3, we consider the complex VR(In; 2) and prove Theorem B.
The Section 4 is devoted to the complex VR(In; 3) and divided into three subsections.
In
Section 4.1, we give a characterization of maximal simplices of VR(In; 3). In Section 4.2, we
prove Theorem C. Finally in Section 4.3, we prove Theorem A. In the last section, we posed a
few conjectures and a question that arise naturally from the work done in this paper.

A graph G is a pair (V (G), E(G)), where V (G) is the set of vertices of G and E(G) ⊆

2. Preliminaries and Notations

V (G)

denotes the set of edges. If (x, y) ∈ E(G), it is also denoted by x ∼ y and we say that x is
(cid:1)
adjacent to y. A subgraph H of G is a graph with V (H) ⊆ V (G) and E(H) ⊆ E(G). For a subset
U ⊆ V (G), the induced subgraph G[U ] is the subgraph whose set of vertices V (G[U ]) = U and
the set of edges E(G[U ]) = {(a, b) ∈ E(G) | a, b ∈ U }.

(cid:0)

A graph homomorphism from G to H is a function φ : V (G) → V (H) such that, (v, w) ∈
E(G) =⇒ (φ(v), φ(w)) ∈ E(H). A graph homomorphism f is called an isomorphism if f is
bijective and f −1 is also a graph homomorphism. Two graphs are called isomorphic, if there
exists an isomorphism between them. If G and H are isomorphic, we write G ∼= H.

Let G be a graph and v be a vertex of G. The neighbourhood of v is deﬁned as NG(v) =

{w ∈ V (G) | (v, w) ∈ E(G)} and the closed neighbourhood NG[v] = NG(v) ∪ {v}.

Let x and y be two distinct vertices of G. A xy-path is a sequence xv0 . . . vny of vertices of
G such that x ∼ v0, vn ∼ y and vi ∼ vi+1 for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. The length of a xy-path is
the number of edges appearing in the path. The distance between x and y is the length of a
shortest path (with respect to length) among all xy-paths and it is denoted by d(x, y). Clearly,
if (x, y) ∈ E(G), then d(x, y) = 1. By convention, d(v, v) = 0 for all v ∈ V (G).

Deﬁnition 2.1. A (ﬁnite) abstract simplicial complex X is a collection of ﬁnite sets such that
if τ ∈ X and σ ⊂ τ , then σ ∈ X.

The elements of X are called simplices or faces of X. The dimension of a simplex σ is equal
to |σ| − 1. The dimension of an abstract simplicial complex is the maximum of the dimensions
of its simplices. The 0-dimensional simplices are called vertices of X. If σ ⊂ τ , we say that σ
is a face of τ . If a simplex has dimension k, it is said to be k-dimensional or k-simplex. The
boundary of a k-simplex σ is the simplicial complex, consisting of all faces of σ of dimension
≤ k − 1 and it is denoted by Bd(σ). A simplex which is not a face of any other simplex is called
a maximal simplex or facet. The set of maximal simplices of X is denoted by M (X).

The join of two simplicial complexes K1 and K2, denoted as K1 ∗ K2, is a simplicial complex
whose simplices are disjoint union of simplices of K1 and K2. Let ∆S denotes a (|S| − 1)-
dimensional simplex with vertex set S. The cone on K with apex a, denoted as Ca(K), is
deﬁned as

Ca(K) := K ∗ ∆{a}.
In this article, we consider any simplicial complex as a topological space, namely its geometric
realization. For the deﬁnition of geometric realization, we refer to book [32] by Kozlov. For
terminologies of algebraic topology used in this article, we refer to [28].

Let X be a simplicial complex and τ, σ ∈ X such that σ ( τ and τ is the only maximal
simplex in X that contains σ. A simplicial collapse of X is the simplicial complex Y obtained
from X by removing all those simplices γ of X such that σ ⊆ γ ⊆ τ . Here, σ is called a free face
of τ and (σ, τ ) is called a collapsible pair. We denote this collapse by X ց Y . In particular, if
X ց Y , then X ≃ Y .

Deﬁnition 2.2. For a positive integer n, the n-dimensional Hypercube graph, denoted by In,
is a graph whose vertex set V (In) = {x1 . . . xn : xi ∈ {0, 1} ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ n} and any two vertices

n

x1 . . . xn and y1 . . . yn are adjacent if and only if

in one position (see Figure 2.1).

We now ﬁx a few notations, which we use throughout this paper. For a positive integer n,
we denote the set {1, . . . , n} by [n]. Let v = v1 . . . vn ∈ V (In). For any i ∈ [n], we let v(i) = vi.
For {i1, i2, . . . , ik} ⊆ [n], we let vi1,...,ik ∈ V (In) deﬁned by

vi1,...,ik (j) =

v(j)
{0, 1} \ {v(j)}

if j /∈ {i1, . . . , ik},
if j ∈ {i1, . . . , ik}.

Observe that for any two vertices v, w ∈ V (In), d(v, w) =

|v(i) − w(i)| and d(v, w) = k if and

only if w = vi1,...,ik for some i1, . . . , ik ∈ [n]. Clearly, NIn(v) = {vi : i ∈ [n]}. For i, j, k ∈ [n], we
let K i,j,k
:= {v, vi,j , vj,k, vi,k}. For the simplicity of notation, we write N (v) and N [v] for the
v
sets NIn(v) and NIn[v] respectively.

3. The complex VR(In; 2)

In this section, we prove Theorem B. We ﬁrst characterise the maximal simplices of VR(In; 2).

Lemma 3.1. Let n ≥ 3 and σ be a maximal simplex of VR(In; 2). Then one of the following
is true:

(i) σ = N [v] for some v ∈ V (In).
(ii) σ = {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0} for some v ∈ V (In) and i0, j0 ∈ [n].
(ii) σ = K i0,j0,k0

for some v ∈ V (In) and i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n].

v

Proof. We consider the following cases.

Case 1. There exists a w ∈ σ such that N (w) ∩ σ 6= ∅.
Let us ﬁrst assume that there exists a vertex w ∈ σ such that N (w) ∩ σ = {v}. Since
w ∈ N (v), w = vp0 for some p0 ∈ [n]. We show that σ = N [v]. Suppose there exists l0 ∈ [n]
such that vl0 /∈ σ. Since σ is maximal, there exists x ∈ σ such that d(x, vl0 ) ≥ 3. Further, since
v ∈ σ, d(v, x) ≤ 2. For any t ∈ [n] \ {l0}, since d(vl0 , vt) = 2, we see that x 6= vt and therefore
d(v, x) = 2. Here x = vi,j for some i, j ∈ [n]. Since N (w) ∩ σ = {v}, p0 /∈ {i, j}. But then
d(x, w) = 3, a contradiction. Thus N (v) ⊆ σ. Since v ∈ σ, we see that N [v] ⊆ σ. Suppose there
exists y ∈ σ such that y /∈ N [v]. Then d(v, y) = 2 and therefore y = vs,t for some s, t ∈ [n].
Choose k ∈ [n] \ {s, t}. Then d(vk, y) = 3, a contradiction as vk ∈ σ. Hence σ = N [v]. Thus σ
is of the type (i).

Now assume that |N (w) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 for all w ∈ σ. Let u ∈ σ. There exists i0, j0 ∈ [n] such
that ui0, uj0 ∈ σ. Thus {u, ui0 , uj0} ⊆ σ. Since |N (ui0) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 and ui0 6∼ uj0, there exists
z ∈ σ \ {u} such that z ∼ ui0. Then z = ui0,k for some k ∈ [n] \ {i0}. Since uj0 ∈ σ,
d(uj0, y) ≤ 2, thereby implying that k = j0. Thus {u, ui0 , uj0, ui0,j0} ⊆ σ. Suppose there
exists q ∈ σ \ {u, ui0 , uj0, ui0,j0}.
If q ∼ u, then q = ui for some i ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0}. Here
d(q, ui0,j0) = 3, a contradiction. Hence q 6∼ u, i.e., d(u, q) = 2. Then q = vj,k for some j, k ∈ [n].
If {i0, j0}∩ {j, k} = ∅, then d(ui0,j0, q) = 4, a contradiction. Hence {i0, j0}∩ {j, k} 6= ∅. Without
loss of generality we assume that i0 ∈ {j, k}. In this case d(q, uj0) = 3, a contradiction. Thus
σ = {u, ui0 , uj0, ui0,j0}. Hence σ is of the type (ii).

Case 2. N (v) ∩ σ = ∅ for all v ∈ σ.
Let v ∈ σ. Clearly, {v} is not a maximal simplex and therefore there exists x ∈ σ, x 6= v.
Since N (v) ∩ σ = ∅ and d(v, x) ≤ 2, we see that d(v, x) = 2. There exist i0, j0 ∈ [n] such that
x = vi0,j0. Hence {v, vi0,j0} ⊆ σ. For any t ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0}, since d(vi0,t, v) = 2 = d(vi0,t, vi0,j0),
we see that {v, vi0,j0, vi0,t} ∈ VR(In; 2). Thus {v, vi0,j0} is not a maximal simplex and therefore
there exists y ∈ σ \ {v, vi0,j0}. Clearly, d(v, y) = 2. There exist i, j ∈ [n] such that y = vi,j. If
{i, j} ∩ {i0, j0} = ∅, then d(y, vi0,j0) ≥ 3, a contradiction. Hence {i, j} ∩ {i0, j0} 6= ∅. Without
loss of generality assume that i = i0. Thus {v, vi0,j0, vi0,j} ⊆ σ. Since N (v) ∩ σ = ∅, vi0 /∈ σ.
Further, since σ is maximal, there exists z ∈ σ such that d(z, vi0 ) ≥ 3. Clearly d(v, z) = 2
and therefore z = vk,l for some k, l ∈ [n]. Since d(z, vi0 ) ≥ 3, i0 /∈ {k, l}. Using the fact that
d(z, vi0,j0) = 2 = d(z, vi0,j), we conclude that {k, l} = {j0, j}. Thus {v, vi0,j0, vi0,j, vj0,j} ⊆ σ.
Suppose there exists a w ∈ σ such that w /∈ {v, vi0,j0, vi0,j, vj0,j}. Here, d(v, w) = 2 and therefore
w = vs,t for some s, t ∈ [n]. Since d(w, vi0,j0) = 2, {i0, j0} ∩ {s, t} 6= ∅. Further, d(w, vi0,j) = 2
implies that {i0, j} ∩ {s, t} 6= ∅ and d(w, vj0,j) = 2 implies that {j0, j} ∩ {s, t} 6= ∅, which is not
possible. Hence σ = {v, vi0,j0, vi0,j, vj0,j} = K i0,j0,j
(cid:3)

. Thus σ is of the type (iii).

v

Lemma 3.2. Let n ≥ 3 and σ ∈ VR(In; 2) be a maximal simplex. If for some v, |N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 3,
then either σ = K i0,j0,k0

for some i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n] or N (v) ⊆ σ.

v

Proof. Let |N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 3. If n = 3, then |N (v)| = 3 and therefore N (v) ⊆ σ. So assume that
n ≥ 4. Suppose N (v) 6⊆ σ. Then there exists l0 ∈ [n] such that vl0 /∈ σ. Since |N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 3,
there exist i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n] such that {vi0, vj0, vk0 } ⊆ σ. Clearly, l0 /∈ {i0, j0, k0}. Since vl0 /∈ σ
and σ is a maximal simplex, there exists x ∈ σ such that d(x, vl0 ) ≥ 3. Observe that for any
vertex u, if d(v, u) = 1, then d(u, vl0 ) ≤ 2. Hence d(v, x) ≥ 2. If d(v, x) ≥ 4, then d(vi0, x) ≥ 3,
a contradiction as vi0 ∈ σ. Hence d(v, x) ≤ 3. If d(v, x) = 3, then x = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n].
4

Since d(vi0, x) ≤ 2, i0 ∈ {i, j, k}. Similarly j0, k0 ∈ {i, j, k}. Hence {i, j, k} = {i0, j0, k0}. Thus
σ = {vi0 , vj0, vk0, vi0,j0,k0} = K i0,j0,k0
vi0 ,j0,k0 .

Suppose d(v, x) = 2. Here, x = vi,j for some i, j ∈ [n]. If i0 /∈ {i, j}, then d(x, vi0 ) = 3, a
contradiction as vi0 ∈ σ. Hence i0 ∈ {i, j}. By similar argument, we can show that j0, k0 ∈
(cid:3)
{i, j}. Hence {i0, j0, k0} ⊆ {i, j}, which is not possible. Thus, N (v) ⊆ σ.

We now review a result, which will play a key role in the proof of Theorem B.
Let X be a simplicial complex on vertex set [n] and let ≺: σ1, . . . , σm be a linear ordering of
the maximal simplices of X. Given a σ ∈ X, the minimal exclusion sequence mes≺(σ) deﬁned
as follows. Let i denote the smallest index such that σ ⊆ σi. If i = 1, then mes≺(σ) is the null
sequence. If i ≥ 2, then mes≺(σ) = (v1, . . . , vi−1) is a ﬁnite sequence of length i − 1 such that
v1 = min(σ \ σ1) and for each k ∈ {2, . . . , i − 1},

vk =

min({v1, . . . , vk−1} ∩ (σ \ σk))
min(σ \ σk)

(

if {v1, . . . , vk−1} ∩ (σ \ σk) 6= ∅,
otherwise.

Let M≺(σ) denote the set of vertices appearing in mes≺(σ). Deﬁne

d≺(X) := max
σ∈X
The following result was stated and proved in [35, Proposition 1.3] as a special case where X is
the nerve of a ﬁnite family of sets and then generalized by Lew for arbitrary simplical complex.

|M≺(σ)|.

Proposition 3.3. [34, Theorem 6]
then X is d≺(X)-collapsible.

If ≺ is a linear ordering of the maximal simplices of X,

We are now ready to prove main result of this section.

v

Proof of Theorem B. Since VR(In; 2) is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of spheres of di-
mension 3, ˜H3(VR(In; 2)) 6= 0 and therefore by using Proposition 1.2 we conclude that collapsi-
bility of VR(In; 2) is ≥ 4. It is enough to show that VR(In; 2) is 4-collapsible. From Lemma 3.1,
each maximal simplex of VR(In; 2) is of the form either (i) N [v] or (ii) {v, vi, vj, vi,j} or (iii)
K i0,j0,k0
. It is easy to check that the sets of these three types of maximal simplices are pairwise
disjoint sets. Choose a linear order ≺1 on maximal simplices of the type (i). Extend ≺1 to a
linear order ≺ on maximal simplices of VR(In; 2), where maximal simplices of the type (i) are
ordered ﬁrst, i.e., for any two maximal simplices σ1 and σ2, if σ1 = N [v] for some v and σ2 is of
the type (ii) or (iii), then σ1 ≺ σ2. Let τ ∈ VR(In; 2). Let σ be the smallest (with respect to
≺) maximal simplex of VR(In; 2) such that τ ⊆ σ. If σ 6= N [v] for all v ∈ V (In), then |σ| = 4
and therefore by deﬁnition |M≺(τ )| ≤ 4. So, assume that σ = N [v] for some v ∈ V (In). We
ﬁrst prove that |M≺(τ ) ∩ N (v)| ≤ 3.

Let mes≺(τ ) = (x1, . . . , xt). Suppose |M≺(τ )∩N (v)| ≥ 4. Let k be the least integer such that
|{x1, . . . , xk}∩N (v)| = 3. Clearly, k < t. Let {x1, . . . , xk}∩N (v) = {xi1, xi2, xi3}. Observe that
xk ∈ {xi1, xi2 , xi3}. We show that {x1, . . . , xk+1} ∩ N (v) = {xi1, xi2, xi3}. Let γ be a maximal
simplex such that γ ≺ σ.
If {x1, . . . , xk} ∩ (σ \ γ) 6= ∅, then xk+1 ∈ {x1, . . . , xk}. Hence
{x1, . . . , xk+1} ∩ N (v) = {xi1, xi2 , xi3}. If {x1, . . . , xk} ∩ (σ \ γ) = ∅, then {xi1 , xi2, xi3} ⊆ γ.
From Lemma 3.2, either N (v) ⊆ γ or γ = K i0,j0,k0
. Hence N (v) ⊆ γ.
Thus xk+1 /∈ N (v), thereby implying that {x1, . . . , xk+1} ∩ N (v) = {xi1, xi2, xi3 }. If k + 1 = t,
then we get a contradiction to the assumption that |M≺(τ ) ∩ N (v)| ≥ 4. Inductively assume
that for all k ≤ l < t, {x1, . . . , xl} ∩ N (v) = {xi1, xi2, xi3}. By the argument similar as above we
can show that {x1, . . . , xt} ∩ N (v) = {xi1, xi2, xi3}, a contradiction. Thus |M≺(τ ) ∩ N (v)| ≤ 3.
Since σ = N [v], we conclude that |M≺(τ )| ≤ 4.

. Since γ ≺ σ, γ 6= K i0,j0,k0

From Proposition 3.3, VR(In; 2) is 4-collapsible. This completes the proof.

4. The complex VR(In; 3)

(cid:3)

In this section, we prove Theorem A and Theorem C. This section is divided into three
In

subsections. In the next subsection, we characterise the maximal simplices of VR(In; 3).

5

subsection 4.2, using the minimal exclusion sequence, we prove Theorem C. Finally, in subsection
4.3, using Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homology, we prove Theorem A.

We ﬁrst ﬁx some notations, which we use throughout this section. For any n ≥ 1, let
∆n = VR(In; 3). We say that a simplex σ ∈ ∆n cover all places, if for each i ∈ [n] there exist
v, w ∈ σ such that v(i) = 1 and w(i) = 0. For each i ∈ {n} and ǫ ∈ {0, 1}, let Ii,ǫ
n be the induced
subgraph of In on the vertex set {v ∈ V (In) : v(i) = ǫ}. Observe that Ii,ǫ
n ∼= In−1.

4.1. Maximal simplices. We give a characterisation of maximal simplices of ∆n in Lemma 4.7.
We ﬁrst stablish few lemmas, which we need to prove Lemma 4.7.

Lemma 4.1. Let n ≥ 5 and σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex such that σ cover all places. Then
N (v) ∩ σ 6= ∅ for all v ∈ σ.

Proof. Suppose there exits v ∈ σ such that N (v) ∩ σ = ∅. Since v1 /∈ σ and σ is a maximal
simplex, there exists x ∈ σ such that d(x, v1) ≥ 4. It is easy to see that if d(x, v) ≤ 2, then
d(x, v1) ≤ 3. Hence d(v, x) = 3. Here, x = vi0,j0,k0 for some i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n]. If 1 ∈ {i0, j0, k0},
then d(v1, x) = 2. Hence 1 /∈ {i0, j0, k0}. Since vi0 /∈ σ, there exists y ∈ σ such that d(y, vi0 ) ≥ 4.
Here d(v, y) = 3. Hence y = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n]. If |{i0, j0, k0} ∩ {i, j, k}| ≤ 1, then
d(y, vi0,j0,k0) ≥ 4, which contradict the fact that vi0,j0,k0 ∈ σ. If i0 ∈ {i, j, k}, then d(vi0 , y) = 2,
a contradiction. So i0 /∈ {i, j, k} and therefore {i0, j0, k0}∩{i, j, k} = {j0, k0}. Hence y = vj0,k0,l0
for some l0 ∈ [n] \ {i0}. So, {v, vi0,j0,k0, vj0,k0,l0} ⊆ σ. Since vj0 /∈ σ, there exists z ∈ σ such
that d(z, vj0 ) ≥ 4. Here, d(v, z) = 3. Since d(z, vi0,j0,k0) ≤ 3 and d(z, vj0,k0,l0) ≤ 3, we conclude
that z = vi0,k0,l0. Further, since vk0 /∈ σ, there exists w ∈ σ such that d(w, vk0 ) ≥ 4. Here
d(v, w) = 3. Since d(w, vi0,j0,k0) ≤ 3, d(w, vj0,k0,l0) ≤ 3 and d(w, vi0,k0,l0) ≤ 3, we conclude
that w = vi0,j0,l0,. So, {v, vi0,j0,k0, vj0,k0,l0, vi0,k0,l0, vi0,j0,l0} ⊆ σ. Since n ≥ 5, there exists
p ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0, k0, l0}. Observe that vi0,j0,k0(p) = vj0,k0,l0(p) = vi0,k0,l0(p) = vi0,j0,l0(p) = v(p).
Since σ cover all places, there exists u ∈ σ such that u(p) = {0, 1} \ {v(p)}. Since N (v) ∩ σ = ∅,
u 6= vp. Thus, either d(v, u) = 2 or d(v, u) = 3. If d(v, u) = 2, then u = vp,r for some r ∈ [n].
If r /∈ {i0, j0, k0}, then d(u, vi0,j0,k0) = 4, a contradiction. Hence r ∈ {i0, j0, k0}. Without
loss of generality we assume that r = i0. In this case d(u, vj0,k0,l0) = 4, a contradiction. Hence
d(v, u) = 3. Here u = vp,s,t for some s, t ∈ [n]. If |{s, t}∩{i0, j0, k0}| ≤ 1, then d(u, vi0,j0,k0) ≥ 4.
Hence {s, t} ⊆ {i0, j0, k0}. Without loss of generality we assume that {s, t} = {i0, j0}. Then
d(u, vi0,k0,l0) = 4, a contradiction. Thus there exists no u ∈ σ such that u(p) = {0, 1} \ {v(p)},
(cid:3)
which is a contradiction to the hypothesis that σ cover all places. Hence N (v) ∩ σ 6= ∅.

Lemma 4.2. Let n ≥ 5 and let σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex such that σ cover all places. If
there exists a w ∈ σ such that N (w) ∩ σ = {v}, then N (v) ⊆ σ.

Proof. Since w ∈ N (v), w = vs for some s ∈ [n]. Without loss of generality we assume that
v = v1 . . . vn, where vi = 0 for each i ∈ [n] and s = n, i.e., w = vn. Suppose N (v) 6⊆ σ. There
exists l0 ∈ [n] such that vl0 /∈ σ. Clearly, l0 6= n. Since σ cover all places, there exists x ∈ σ
such that x(l0) = 1. Further, since x 6= vl0, d(x, v) ≥ 2. Thus, either d(x, v) = 3 or d(x, v) = 2.
We consider the following two cases:

Case 1. d(x, v) = 3.
Here, x = vl0,i0,j0 for some i0, j0 ∈ [n].

If n /∈ {i0, j0}, then d(x, vn) = 4. Since vn ∈ σ,
d(x, vn) ≤ 3 and thereby implying that n ∈ {i0, j0}. Without loss of generality we assume that
n = j0, i.e., x = vl0,i0,n.

From Lemma 4.1, there exists y ∈ σ such that y ∼ x. Clearly y 6= v, vn. There exists j ∈ [n]
such that y = xj. If j /∈ {l0, i0, n}, then d(y, v) ≥ 4. Hence j ∈ {l0, i0, n} and thereby implying
that d(y, v) = 2. If j 6= n, then y = vl0,n or y = vi0,n. In both the cases y ∼ w = vn, which is
not possible since N (w) ∩ σ = {v}. Hence j = n and y = vl0,i0. So, {v, vn, vl0,i0,n, vl0,i0} ⊆ σ.

Since vi0,n ∼ vn = w and N (w) ∩ σ = {v}, we see that vi0,n /∈ σ. Further, since σ is a
maximal simplex, there exists z ∈ σ such that d(z, vi0,n) ≥ 4. Observe that for any vertex
t, if t ∼ v, then d(t, vi0,n) ≤ 3 and therefore we see that z 6∼ v. Since z, v ∈ σ, d(z, v) ≤ 3.
Thus, either d(z, v) = 3 or d(z, v) = 2. If d(z, v) = 3, then z = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n].
6

Observe that if n /∈ {i, j, k}, then d(z, vn) = 4, a contradiction as vn ∈ σ. Hence n ∈ {i, j, k}.
Without loss of generality we assume that i = n, i.e., z = vn,j,k. But, then d(z, vi0,n) ≤ 3,
which is a contradiction as d(z, vi0,n) ≥ 4. Thus d(z, v) = 2. So, z = vi,j for some i, j ∈ [n]. If
{i, j} ∩ {i0, n} 6= φ, then d(vi,j, vi0,n) ≤ 3. Hence d(z, vi0,n) ≥ 4 implies that {i, j} ∩ {i0, n} = ∅.
If {i, j} ∩ {l0, n, i0} = ∅, then d(vi,j, vl0,i0,n) ≥ 4. Since vl0,i0,n ∈ σ, {i, j} ∩ {l0, i0, n} 6= ∅.
Thus, we conclude that {i, j} ∩ {l0, i0, n} = {l0}. Hence z = vl0,k0 for some k0 6= i0, n. So,
{v, vn, vl0,i0,n, vl0,i0, vl0,k0} ⊆ σ.

Since vl0,n ∼ vn and N (vn) ∩ σ = {v}, vl0,n /∈ σ. Hence there exists p ∈ σ such that
d(p, vl0,n) ≥ 4. Observe that for any u ∼ v, d(u, vl0,n) ≤ 3 and therefore p 6∼ v. Thus,
d(p, v) ≥ 2. Suppose d(p, v) = 3. Then p = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n]. If n /∈ {i, j, k}, then
d(p, vn) = 4, a contradiction as vn ∈ σ. Hence n ∈ {i, j, k}. Without loss of generality we
assume that i = n, i.e., p = vn,j,k. But, then d(p, vl0,n) ≤ 3, which is a contradiction. Thus
d(p, v) = 2. So, p = vi,j for some i, j ∈ [n].
If {i, j} ∩ {l0, n} 6= φ, then d(vi,j, vl0,n) ≤ 3.
Hence {i, j} ∩ {l0, n} = ∅. If {i, j} ∩ {l0, i0, n} = ∅, then d(vi,j, vl0,i0,n) ≥ 4. Since vl0,i0,n ∈ σ,
{i, j} ∩ {l0, i0, n} 6= ∅. Hence {i, j} ∩ {l0, i0, n} = {i0}. Thus p = vi0,j for some j 6= n, l0. If
j 6= k0, then d(p, vl0,k0) = 4, which is a contradiction as vl0,k0 ∈ σ. Hence p = vi0,k0. So,
{v, vn, vl0,i0,n, vl0,i0, vl0,k0, vi0,k0} ⊆ σ.

Since n ≥ 5, there exists j0 ∈ [n] \ {l0, i0, k0, n}. Further, since σ cover all places, there
exits q ∈ σ such that q(j0) = 1. Observe that 0 = v(j0) = vn(j0) = vl0,n,i0(j0) = vl0,i0(j0) =
vl0,k0(j0) = vi0,k0(j0) and therefore q /∈ {v, vn, vl0,i0,n, vl0,i0, vl0,k0, vi0,k0}. Since d(vj0 , vl0,i0,n) =
4, q 6= vj0. Hence d(q, v) ≥ 2.

(1.1) d(q, v) = 2.

Here, q = vj0,i for some i ∈ [n]. If i /∈ {l0, i0, n}, then d(q, vl0,i0,n) ≥ 4. Hence vl0,i0,n ∈
σ implies that i ∈ {l0, i0, n}. However, since d(vj0,l0, vi0,k0) = 4 = d(vj0,i0, vl0,k0) =
d(vj0,n, vi0,k0), we conclude that i /∈ {l0, i0, n}. Thus, there exist no q ∈ σ such that
q(j0) = 1, which is a contradiction to the assumption that σ cover all places.

(1.2) d(q, v) = 3.

Here, q = vj0,i,j for some i, j ∈ [n]. Observe that if |{i, j} ∩ {l0, i0, n}| ≤ 1, then
d(q, vl0,i0,n) ≥ 4, which is not possible since vl0,i0,n ∈ σ. Hence {i, j} ⊂ {l0, i0, n}. If
n /∈ {i, j}, then d(q, vn) = 4, a contradiction as vn ∈ σ. Hence n ∈ {i, j}. Without
loss of generality we assume that i = n, i.e., q = vj0,n,j, where j ∈ {l0, i0}. It is easy
to see that d(vj0,n,l0, vi0,k0) ≥ 4 and d(vj0,n,i0, vl0,k0) ≥ 4. Since vi0,k0, vl0,k0 ∈ σ, we see
that q /∈ {vj0,l0,n, vj0,i0,n}. Thus, there exists no q ∈ σ such that q(j0) = 1, which is a
contradiction.

Case 2. d(x, v) = 2.
Here, x = vl0,s0 for some s0 ∈ [n]. So, {v, vn, vl0,s0} ⊆ σ. Since vl0,n ∼ vn = w and
N (w) ∩ σ = {v}, vl0,n /∈ σ. Hence there exists y0 ∈ σ such that d(y0, vl0,n) ≥ 4. Observe that
for any t ∼ v, d(t, vl0,n) ≤ 3 and therefore y0 6∼ v. Thus, d(y0, v) ≥ 2. Suppose d(y0, v) = 3.
Then y0 = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n].
If n /∈ {i, j, k}, then d(y0, vn) ≥ 4, a contradiction
as y0, vn ∈ σ. Hence n ∈ {i, j, k}. But, then d(y0, vl0,n) ≤ 3, again a contradiction. Thus,
d(y0, v) = 2. Here, y0 = vi,j for some i, j ∈ [n]. If {i, j} ∩ {l0, n} 6= ∅, then d(y0, vl0,n) ≤ 3.
Hence {i, j} ∩ {l0, n} = ∅. Further, if s0 /∈ {i, j}, then d(y0, vl0,s0) ≥ 4. Hence s0 ∈ {i, j}.
Therefore y0 = vs0,t0 for some t0 ∈ [n], t0 6= l0, n. So, {v, vn, vl0,s0, vs0,t0} ⊆ σ.

Since vs0,n ∼ vn and N (vn) ∩ σ = {v}, vs0,n /∈ σ. Hence there exists z0 ∈ σ such that
d(z0, vs0,n) ≥ 4. By the argument similar as above for the y0, we see that d(z0, v) = 2. Therefore
z0 = vi,j for some i, j ∈ [n]. If {i, j}∩{s0, n} 6= ∅, then d(z0, vs0,n) ≤ 3. Hence {i, j}∩{s0, n} = ∅.
If l0 /∈ {i, j}, then d(z0, vl0,s0) ≥ 4 and if t0 /∈ {i, j}, then d(z0, vs0,t0) ≥ 4. Since vl0,s0, vs0,t0 ∈ σ,
we conclude that {i, j} = {l0, s0}, i.e., z0 = vl0,t0. So, {v, vn, vl0,s0, vs0,t0, vl0,t0} ⊆ σ.

Since n ≥ 5, there exists m0 ∈ [n] \ {n, l0, s0, t0}. Further, since σ cover all places, there
exists p0 ∈ σ such that p0(m0) = 1. Clearly, u(m0) = 0 for all u ∈ {v, vn, vl0,s0, vs0,t0, vl0,t0}.
Hence p0 /∈ {v, vn, vl0,s0, vs0,t0, vl0,t0}.

Claim 1. p0 = vm0.
Proof of Claim 1. Since p0, v ∈ σ, d(p0, v) ≤ 3. Suppose d(p0, v) = 3. Then p0 = vm0,i,j
If n /∈ {i, j}, then d(p0, vn) = 4 and therefore n ∈ {i, j}. Further, if
for some i, j ∈ [n].
{s0, l0} ∩ {i, j} = ∅, then d(p0, vl0,s0) ≥ 4, which is not possible since vl0,s0 ∈ σ. Hence {i, j} ∩
{l0, s0} 6= ∅ and therefore we see that p0 is either vm0,n,s0 or vm0,n,l0. But d(vm0,n,s0, vl0,t0) = 5
and d(vm0,n,l0, vs0,t0) = 5. Hence p0 6∈ {vm0,n,s0, vm0,n,l0}. Therefore d(p0, v) ≤ 2.

If d(p0, v) = 2, then p0 = vm0,i for some i ∈ [n]. Since vl0,t0, vl0,s0 ∈ σ and d(vm0,s0, vl0,t0) =
4 = d(vm0,t0, vl0,s0), we conclude that i 6∈ {s0, t0}. But, then d(p0, vs0,t0) = 4, a contradiction as
(cid:3)
vs0,t0 ∈ σ. Hence d(p0, v) = 1. Therefore p0 = vm0 . This completes the proof of Claim 1.

So, {v, vn, vl0,s0, vs0,t0, vl0,t0, vm0 } ⊆ σ. Since σ is a maximal simplex and vl0 /∈ σ, there exists
q0 ∈ σ such that d(q0, vl0) ≥ 4. Observe that for any t, if d(v, t) ≤ 2, then d(t, vl0 ) ≤ 3. Hence
d(v, q0) = 3. Here, q0 = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n]. If n /∈ {i, j, k}, then d(q0, vn) ≥ 4. Hence
n ∈ {i, j, k}. If l0 ∈ {i, j, k}, then d(q0, vl0) ≤ 3. Hence l0 /∈ {i, j, k}. Further, if s0 /∈ {i, j, k},
then d(q0, vl0,s0) = 5 and therefore we see that s0 ∈ {i, j, k}. Without loss of generality we
assume that i = n and j = s0, i.e., q0 = vn,s0,k. If t0 6= k, then d(q0, vl0,t0) ≥ 4, a contradiction
as vl0,t0 ∈ σ. Hence k = t0, i.e., q0 = vn,s0,t0. But, then d(q0, vm0 ) = 4, a contradiction. Thus,
there exists no q0 such that d(q0, vl0) ≥ 4, a contradiction.

Therefore we conclude that N (v) ⊆ σ. This completes the proof.
Recall that for a v ∈ V (In) and i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n], K i0,j0,k0

v

= {v, vi0,j0, vi0,k0, vj0,k0}.

Lemma 4.3. Let n ≥ 5 and let σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex such that σ cover all places. If
there exists a w ∈ σ such that N (w)∩σ = {v}, then σ = N (v)∪K i0,j0,k0
for some i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n].
Proof. From Lemma 4.2, N (v) ⊆ σ. Since w ∼ v, w = vl0 for some l0 ∈ [n]. Suppose there
exists x ∈ σ such that d(x, v) = 3. Then x = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n]. Choose t ∈ [n] \ {i, j, k}.
Then d(x, vt) = 4, a contradiction as vt ∈ N (v) ⊆ σ. Hence d(v, x) ≤ 2 for all x ∈ σ. Since
N (w) ∩ σ = {v}, vi,l0 /∈ σ for all i ∈ [n], i 6= l0. Further, since σ is a maximal simplex
and v1,l0 /∈ σ, there exists x0 ∈ σ such that d(x0, v1,l0 ) ≥ 4. For any p ∼ v, d(p, v1,l0 ) ≤ 3
and therefore d(x0, v) = 2. Hence x0 = vi0,j0 for some i0, j0 ∈ [n]. If {i0, j0} ∩ {1, l0} 6= ∅,
then d(x0, v1,l0 ) ≤ 3. Hence {i0, j0} ∩ {1, l0} = ∅. Thus {v, v1, . . . , vn, vi0,j0} ⊆ σ. Since
vi0,l0 /∈ σ, there exists y0 ∈ σ such that d(y0, vi0,l0) ≥ 4. For any q ∈ N (v), d(q, vi0,l0) ≤ 3
and therefore d(y0, v) ≥ 2. Since d(x, v) ≤ 2 for all x ∈ σ, we see that d(y0, v) = 2. Hence
y0 = vi,j for some i, j. If {i, j} ∩ {i0, j0} = ∅, then d(y0, vi0,j0) ≥ 4. Hence {i, j} ∩ {i0, j0} 6= ∅.
If i0 ∈ {i, j}, then d(y0, vi0,l0) ≤ 3. Hence i0 /∈ {i, j}. Thus y0 = vj0,k0 for some k0 6=
i0, l0. So, {v, v1, . . . , vn, vi0,j0, vj0,k0} ⊆ σ. Since vj0,l0 /∈ σ, there exists z0 ∈ σ such that
d(z0, vj0,l0) ≥ 4. By an argument similar as above for y0, we can see that z0 = vi0,k0. So,
{v, v1, . . . , vn, vi0,j0, vj0,k0, vi0,k0} ⊆ σ.

Suppose there exists p ∈ σ such that p /∈ {v, v1, . . . , vn, vi0,j0, vi0,k0, vj0,k0}. Since d(v, x) ≤ 2
for all x ∈ σ and p /∈ N (v), we see that d(v, p) = 2. Here, p = vi,j for some i, j ∈ [n]. Since
d(p, vi0,j0) ≤ 3, d(p, vi0,k0) ≤ 3 and d(p, vj0,k0) ≤ 3, we see that {i, j} ∩ {i0, j0} 6= ∅, {i, j} ∩
{i0, k0} 6= ∅ and {i, j} ∩ {j0, k0} 6= ∅. But this is possible only if {i, j} = {i0, j0}, or {i, j} =
{i0, k0} or {i, j} = {j0, k0}. Thus σ = {v, v1, . . . , vn, vi0,j0, vi0,k0, vj0,k0} = N (v) ∪ K i0,j0,k0
. (cid:3)
Lemma 4.4. Let n ≥ 5 and σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex. If |N (w) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 for all w ∈ σ,
then there exists ˜v ∈ σ such that |N (˜v) ∩ σ| ≥ 3.

v

Proof. Let |N (w) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 for all w ∈ σ. If |N (w) ∩ σ| ≥ 3 for all w ∈ σ, then we are done.
So assume that there exists v ∈ σ such that |N (v) ∩ σ| = 2. There exist i0, j0 ∈ [n] such that
{v, vi0 , vj0} ⊆ σ. Since |N (v) ∩ σ| = 2, vi /∈ σ for all i 6= i0, j0. Choose p ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0}. Since
vp /∈ σ and σ is maximal, there exists x0 ∈ σ such that d(x0, vp) ≥ 4. Observe that for any
u ∈ V (In), if d(v, u) ≤ 2, then d(vp, u) ≤ 3. Hence d(v, x0) = 3. Here, x0 = vi,j,k for some
i, j, k ∈ [n]. If i0 /∈ {i, j, k}, then d(x0, vi0 ) = 4, a contradiction as vi0 ∈ σ. Hence i0 ∈ {i, j, k}.
By similar argument, j0 ∈ {i, j, k}. Thus x0 = vi0,j0,k0 for some k0 ∈ [n].
If k0 = p, then

8

d(x0, vp) = 2, a contradiction. Hence k0 6= p. So, {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,k0} ⊆ σ. Since vk0 /∈ σ,
there exists y0 ∈ σ such that d(y0, vk0) ≥ 4. By an argument similar as above, d(v, y0) = 3 and
y0 = vi0,j0,l0 for some l0 ∈ [n]. If l0 = k0, then d(y0, vk0) = 2, a contradiction. Hence l0 6= k0.
So, {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,k0, vi0,j0,l0} ⊆ σ. Observe that N (vi0,j0,l0) ∩ {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,k0} = ∅. Since
|N (vi0,j0,l0) ∩ σ| ≥ 2, there exists z0 ∈ σ such that z0 ∼ vi0,j0,l0. Further, d(z0, v) ≤ 3 implies
that z0 ∈ {vi0,j0, vi0,l0, vj0,l0}. We consider the following cases.

(1) z0 = vi0,j0.

In this case, {vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,l0} ⊆ N (vi0,j0) ∩ σ. We take ˜v = vi0,j0.

(2) z0 = vi0,l0.

(3) z0 = vj0,l0.

In this case, {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,k0, vi0,j0,l0, vi0,l0} ⊆ σ. Since |N (vi0,j0,k0) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 and
N (vi0,j0,k0) ∩ {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,l0, vi0,j0,k0, vi0,l0} = ∅, there exists u0 ∈ σ such that u0 ∼
vi0,j0,k0. Now d(v, u0) ≤ 3 implies that u0 ∈ {vi0,j0, vi0,k0, vj0,k0}. Since d(vj0,k0, vi0,l0) =
4 and vi0,l0 ∈ σ, we see that u0 6= vj0,k0. If u0 = vi0,j0, then {vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,l0} ⊆ N (u0)∩σ
and we take ˜v = u0. If u0 = vi0,k0, then {v, vi0,l0, vi0,k0} ⊆ N (vi0)∩σ and we take ˜v = vi0.

In this case, {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,k0, vi0,j0,l0, vj0,l0} ⊆ σ. Since |N (vi0) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 and
N (vi0) ∩ {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,k0, vi0,j0,l0, vj0,l0} = {v}, there exists w0 ∈ σ, w 6= v such that
w0 ∼ vi0. Since w0 6= v, we see that w0 = vi0,i for some i ∈ [n]. If i /∈ {j0, l0}, then
d(w0, vj0,l0) = 4, a contradiction as vj0,l0 ∈ σ. Hence i ∈ {j0, l0}.
If i = j0, then
w0 = vi0,j0 and {vi0, vj0, vi0,j0,l0} ⊆ N (w0) ∩ σ. We take ˜v = w0. So, assume that i = l0,
i.e., w0 = vi0,l0.

Here {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,k0, vi0,j0,l0, vj0,l0, vi0,l0} ⊆ σ. Since |N (vi0,j0,k0) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 and
N (vi0,j0,k0) ∩ {v, vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,k0, vi0,j0,l0, vj0,l0, vi0,l0} = ∅, there exists q0 ∈ σ such that
q0 ∼ vi0,j0,k0. Since d(v, q0) ≤ 3, we see that q0 ∈ {vi0,j0, vi0,k0, vj0,k0}. Further, since
d(vj0,k0, vi0,l0) = 4, q0 6= vj0,k0. If q0 = vi0,j0, then {vi0 , vj0, vi0,j0,l0} ⊆ N (q0) ∩ σ and we
take ˜v = q0. If q0 = vi0,k0, then {v, vi0,l0, vi0,k0} ⊆ N (vi0 ) ∩ σ and we take ˜v = vi0.

This completes the proof.

Lemma 4.5. Let n ≥ 5 and σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex such that σ cover all places. Let
|N (w) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 for all w ∈ σ. If there exists a v ∈ σ such that |N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 3, then N (v) ⊆ σ.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that v = v1 . . . vn, where vi = 0 for all i ∈ [n].
Suppose N (v) 6⊆ σ. Then there exists l0 ∈ [n] such that vl0 /∈ σ. Since |N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 3, there
exist i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n] \ {l0} such that {vi0 , vj0, vk0} ⊆ σ. Further, since σ is maximal and vl0 /∈ σ,
there exists x0 ∈ σ such that d(x0, vl0 ) ≥ 4. Observe that d(v, x0) = 3 and therefore x0 = vi,j,k
for some i, j, k ∈ [n]. Since d(x0, vl0) ≥ 4, l0 /∈ {i, j, k}. If i0 /∈ {i, j, k}, then d(x0, vi0) = 4,
a contradiction as vi0 ∈ σ. Hence i0 ∈ {i, j, k}. By similar arguments, j0, k0 ∈ {i,j, k} and
therefore x0 = vi0,j0,k0. So, {v, vi0 , vj0, vk0, vi0,j0,k0} ⊆ σ.

Observe that for any u ∈ {v, vi0 , vj0, vk0 , vi0,j0,k0}, u(l0) = 0. Since σ cover all places, there
exists y0 ∈ σ such that y0(l0) = 1. Since vl0 /∈ σ, y0 6= vl0. Hence d(v, y0) ≥ 2. Suppose
d(v, y0) = 3. Then y0 = vl0,i,j for some i, j. If k ∈ {i0, j0, k0} \ {i, j}, then d(y0, vk) ≥ 4, a
contradiction as vk ∈ σ. Hence d(v, y0) = 2. So, y0 = vl0,i for some i ∈ [n]. If i /∈ {i0, j0, k0},
then d(y0, vi0,j0,k0) ≥ 4. Since vi0,j0,k0 ∈ σ, we see that i ∈ {i0, j0, k0}. Without loss of generality
we assume that i = i0, i.e., y0 = vl0,i0. So, {v, vi0 , vj0, vk0, vi0,j0,k0, vl0,i0} ⊆ σ.

Observe that N (vl0,i0)∩{v, vi0 , vj0, vk0, vi0,j0,k0, vl0,i0} = {vi0}. Since |N (vl0,i0)∩σ| ≥ 2, there
exists z0 ∈ σ, z0 6= vi0 such that z0 ∼ vl0,i0. Further, since z0 6= vi0 and vl0 /∈ σ, z0 = vl0,i0,i for
some i ∈ [n]. If i 6= j0, then d(z0, vj0) = 4, a contradiction as vj0 ∈ σ. Hence z0 = vl0,i0,j0. But
then d(z0, vk0 ) = 4, a contradiction. Hence N (vl0,i0) ∩ σ = {vi0 }, which is a contradiction.

Thus, we conclude that N (v) ⊆ σ.

Lemma 4.6. Let n ≥ 5 and σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex such that σ cover all places. If
|N (w) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 for all w ∈ σ, then there exist v, w ∈ σ such that v ∼ w and σ = N (v) ∪ N (w).
9

Proof. Using Lemma 4.4 and Lemma 4.5, we conclude that there exists v ∈ σ such that N (v) ⊆
σ. Hence {v, v1, . . . , vn} ⊆ σ. Observe that N (v1)∩{v, v1, . . . , vn} = {v}. Since |N (v1)∩σ| ≥ 2,
there exists x0 ∈ σ, x0 6= v such that x0 ∼ v1. Then x0 = v1,i1 for some i1 ∈ [n]. So,
{v, v1, . . . , vn, v1,i1 } ⊆ σ. Choose i2 ∈ [n] \ {1, i1}.

Observe that vi2 ∈ σ and N (vi2 ) ∩ {v, v1, . . . , vn, v1,i1} = {v}. Since |N (vi2 ) ∩ σ| ≥ 2, there
exists y0 ∈ σ, y0 6= v such that y0 ∼ vi2. Further, since y0 6= v, we see that y0 = vi2,i for
some i ∈ [n]. If i /∈ {1, i1}, then d(y0, v1,i1) = 4, a contradiction as v1,i1 ∈ σ. Hence either
y0 = vi2,1 or y0 = vi2,i1. If y0 = vi2,1, then {v, v1,i1 , vi2,1} ⊆ N (v1) ∩ σ. Hence from Lemma 4.5,
If y0 = vi2,i1, then {v, v1,i1 , vi2,i1} ⊆ N (vi1 ) ∩ σ and
N (v1) ⊆ σ. Thus N (v) ∪ N (v1) ⊆ σ.
therefore Lemma 4.5 implies that N (vi1 ) ⊆ σ. Hence N (v) ∪ N (vi1 ) ⊆ σ.

Thus, we have shown that there exist vertices v, w ∈ σ such that v ∼ w and N (v)∪N (w) ⊆ σ.
We now show that σ ⊆ N (v) ∪ N (w). Suppose there exists z0 ∈ σ such that z0 /∈ N (v) ∪ N (w).
Since w ∼ v, w = vl0 for some l0 ∈ [n]. Clearly, d(z0, v) ≥ 2. Suppose d(z0, v) = 2. Then
z0 = vi,j for some i, j ∈ [n]. If l0 ∈ {i, j}, then z0 ∼ vl0, which is a contradiction as z0 /∈ N (w).
Hence l0 /∈ {i, j}. Choose k0 ∈ [n] \ {l0, i, j}. Since N (vl0) ⊆ σ and vl0 ∼ vl0,k0, we see that
vl0,k0 ∈ σ. But then d(z0, vl0,k0) = 4, a contradiction. Now let d(z0, v) = 3. Then z0 = vi,j,k for
some i, j, k. Choose p ∈ [n] \ {i, j, k}. Then N (v) ⊆ σ implies that vp ∈ σ. But d(z0, vp) = 4, a
(cid:3)
contradiction. Thus, we conclude that N (v) ∪ N (w) = σ.

We are now ready to give a characterization of maximal simplices of ∆n. Recall that for
n is the induced subgraph of In on the vertex set {v ∈ V (In) : v(i) = ǫ}.

i ∈ {n} and ǫ ∈ {0, 1}, Ii,ǫ

Lemma 4.7. Let n ≥ 4 and let σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex. Then dim(σ) ∈ {7, n + 3, 2n − 1}.
Moreover, if dim(σ) 6= 7, then either σ = N (v) ∪ N (w) for some v ∼ w, or σ = N (u) ∪ K i,j,k
for some u and i, j, k ∈ [n].

u

Proof. Proof is by induction on n. Let n = 4. For any two vertices v, w ∈ V (I4), let {v, w}
denote a simplicial complex on two vertices, i.e., {v, w} ∼= S0. Let v = 0000. It is easy to check
that
∆n = {v, v1,2,3,4}∗{v1, v2,3,4}∗{v2, v1,3,4}∗{v3, v1,2,4}∗{v4, v1,2,3}∗{v1,2, v3,4}∗{v1,3, v2,4}∗{v1,4, v2,3},
the join of 8-copies of S0. Therefore each maximal simplex of ∆4 is of dimension 7. So assume
that n ≥ 5. Inductively assume that result is true for each VR(Ir; 3), where 4 ≤ r < n.

Let σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex. Suppose σ cover all places. Then from Lemma 4.1,
|N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 1 for all v ∈ σ. If there exists a vertex w ∈ σ such that N (w) ∩ σ = {v}, then
from Lemma 4.3, σ = N (v) ∪ K i0,j0,k0
for some i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n]. Clearly dim(σ) = n + 3. If
|N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 2 for all v ∈ σ, then from Lemma 4.6, there exist v, w ∈ σ such that v ∼ w and
σ = N (v) ∪ N (w). It is easy to check that dim(σ) = 2n − 1.

So, assume that σ does not cover all places. There exists l ∈ [n] such that v(l) = w(l)
for all v, w ∈ σ. Without loss of generality we assume that v(l) = 0 for all v ∈ σ. Observe
that σ ∈ VR(Il,0

n ∼= In−1, by induction hypothesis, either dim(σ) = 7 or; σ = NIl,0

the maximality of σ. Hence dim(σ) = 7. This completes the proof.

4.2. Collapsibility. In this section, we prove Theorem C. We ﬁrst establish few lemmas, which
we need to prove Theorem C.

Let X be a topological space and A be a subspace of X. Recall that a retraction of X onto

A is a map r : X → A such that r(a) = a for all a ∈ A.

Lemma 4.8. Let n > m and let H be an m-dimensional cube subgraph of In. Then there exists
a retraction r : ∆n → VR(H; 3).

10

Proof. Observe that, there exist sequences (i1, . . . , in−m) and (ǫ1, . . . , ǫn−m), where i1, . . . , in−m
∈ [n], ǫ1, . . . , ǫn−m ∈ {0, 1} such that H is the induced subgraph of In on the vertex set {v ∈
V (In) : v(ij) = ǫj ∀ 1 ≤ j ≤ n − m}. Deﬁne r1 : V (In) → V (I i1,ǫ1
) as follows: for v ∈ V (In)
and t ∈ [n],

ǫ1
We extend the map r1 to ˜r1 : ∆n → VR(Ii1,ǫ1
; 3) by ˜r1(σ) := {r1(v) : v ∈ σ} for all σ ∈ ∆n.
Let σ ∈ ∆n and let v, w ∈ σ. Then d(v, w) ≤ 3.
If v(i1) = w(i1), then r1(v) = r1(w)
and therefore d(r1(v), r1(w)) = d(v, w). If v(i1) 6= w(i1), then d(r1(v), r1(w)) = d(v, w) − 1.
So, d(r1(v), r1(w)) ≤ d(v, w) ≤ 3. Thus, ˜r1(σ) ∈ VR(Ii1,ǫ1
; 3). Hence ˜r1 is well deﬁned.
Clearly ˜r1 is onto and for any σ ∈ VR(Ii1,ǫ1
If
m = n − 1, then we take r = ˜r1. Suppose m < n − 1. Let n − m = k. Assume that we have a
retraction ˜rk−1 : ∆n → VR(Hk−1; 3), where Hk−1 is the induced subgraph of In on the vertex
set {v ∈ V (In) : v(ij) = ǫj ∀ 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1}. Deﬁne rk : V (Hk−1) → V (H) as follows: for
v ∈ V (Hk−1) and t ∈ [n],

Extend the map rk to ˜rk : VR(Hk−1; 3) → VR(H; 3) by ˜rk(σ) := {rk(v) : v ∈ σ} for all
σ ∈ ∆n. Clearly, ˜rk is a retraction. We take r as the composition of the maps ˜rk and ˜rk−1.
(cid:3)
This completes the proof.

Lemma 4.9. Let n ≥ 5 and σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex. If for some v, |N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 4, then
N [v] ⊆ σ.

Proof. Let |N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 4. Suppose N (v) 6⊆ σ. Then there exists a l0 ∈ [n] such that vl0 /∈ σ.
Since |N (v) ∩ σ| ≥ 4, there exist i0, j0, k0, p0 ∈ [n] such that {vi0 , vj0, vk0, vp0} ⊆ σ. Clearly
l0 /∈ {i0, j0, k0, p0}. Since vl0 /∈ σ and σ is a maximal simplex, there exists x0 ∈ σ such
that d(x0, vl0) ≥ 4. Observe that for any vertex u, if d(v, u) ≤ 2, then d(u, vl0 ) ≤ 3. Hence
d(v, x0) = 3. Here, x0 = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n].
If i0 /∈ {i, j, k}, then d(x0, vi0 ) = 4,
a contradiction as vi0 ∈ σ. Hence i0 ∈ {i, j, k}. By similar arguments, we can show that
j0, k0, p0 ∈ {i, j, k}. Hence {i0, j0, k0, p0} ⊆ {i, j, k}, which is not possible. Thus, N (v) ⊆ σ.

Suppose v /∈ σ, then there exists a vertex y0 ∈ σ such that d(v, y0) ≥ 4. Suppose d(v, y0) = 4.
Let y0 = vi,j,k,l. Since n ≥ 5, there exists t ∈ [n] \ {i, j, k, l}. Then d(y0, vt) ≥ 4, a contradiction
as vt ∈ σ. Hence d(v, y0) ≥ 5. But then d(vi0 , y0) ≥ 4, again a contradiction. Hence v ∈ σ.
(cid:3)
Thus, N [v] ⊆ σ.

Lemma 4.10. Let n ≥ 5 and let σ ∈ ∆n be a maximal simplex. Let there exists a vertex v such
that {vi0,j0, vi0,k0, vj0,k0, vp0, vq0} ⊆ σ, where p0, q0 /∈ {i0, j0, k0}. Then σ = N (v) ∪ K i0,j0,k0
Proof. We ﬁrst show that vi0 ∈ σ. If vi0 /∈ σ, then there exists y0 ∈ σ such that d(vi0, y0) ≥ 4.
Observe that d(v, y0) ≥ 3.
(1) d(v, y0) = 3.

.

v

Here, y0 = vi,j,k for some i, j, k ∈ [n]. Since d(y0, vp0) ≤ 3 and d(y0, vq0) ≤ 3, we see
that p0, q0 ∈ {i, j, k}. Without loss of generality we assume that i = p0 and j = q0, i.e.,
y0 = vp0,q0,k. Then either d(y0, vi0,j0) ≥ 4, or d(y0, vi0,k0) ≥ 4, or d(y0, vj0,k0) ≥ 4, a
contradiction as vi0,j0, vi0,k0, vj0,k0 ∈ σ.

(2) d(v, y0) ≥ 4.

Observe that if d(v, y0) ≥ 5, then d(y0, vp0) ≥ 4, which is not possible, since y0, vp0 ∈
σ. Hence d(v, y0) = 4. There exist i, j, k, l ∈ [n] such that y0 = vi,j,k,l. Since d(y0, vp0) ≤
3 and d(y0, vq0) ≤ 3, we see that p0, q0 ∈ {i, j, k, l}. Further, since d(vi0 , y0) ≥ 4, i0 /∈
{i, j, k, l}. If {j0, k0} 6⊆ {i, j, k, l}, then d(y0, vj0,k0) ≥ 4, a contradiction as vj0,k0 ∈ σ.
Hence y0 = vp0,q0,j0,k0. But then d(y0, vi0,j0) ≥ 4, a contradiction.

11

Hence vi0 ∈ σ. By similar arguments vj0, vk0 ∈ σ. Since {vi0 , vj0, vk0, vp0, vq0} ⊆ N (v) ∩ σ,
is
(cid:3)

from Lemma 4.9, N [v] ⊆ σ. Hence N (v) ∪ K i0,j0,k0
a maximal simplex and therefore σ = N (v) ∪ K i0,j0,k0

⊆ σ. From Lemma 4.3, N (v) ∪ K i0,j0,k0

By using Lemma 4.7, we write the set of maximal simplices of ∆n, M (∆n) = An ∪ Bn ∪ Cn,

Bn = {σ ∈ M (∆n) : σ = N (v) ∪ N (w) for some v, w ∈ V (In), v ∼ w} and

Lemma 4.11. Let n ≥ 5. Then by using a sequence of elementary 8-collapses, ∆n collapses to

Proof. Let σ ∈ An. Then σ = N (v) ∪ K i0,j0,k0

∪ {vi0, vj0, vk0, vi} : i ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0, k0}}.

Proof of Claim 2. Without loss of generality we assume that {i0, j0, k0} = {1, 2, 3}. From
Lemma 4.10, ({v1,2, v1,3, v2,3, v4, v5}, σ) is a collapsible pair. Thus, σ ց σ \ {v4}, σ \ {v5}, σ \
{v1,2}, σ \ {v1,3}, σ \ {v2,3}. Observe that σ \ {v1,2} ⊆ N (v) ∪ N (v3), σ \ {v1,3} ⊆ N (v) ∪
N (v2), σ \ {v2,3} ⊆ N (v) ∪ N (v1). From Lemma 4.7, for any u ∼ w, N (u) ∪ N (w) is a
maximal simplex in ∆n and therefore we see that ∆n collapses to a subcomplex X1, where
M (X1) = M (∆n) \ {σ} ∪ {σ \ {v4}, σ \ {v5}}.

Hence claim is true if n = 5. So assume that n ≥ 6. From Lemma 4.10, ({v1,2, v1,3, v2,3, v5, v6},
σ) and ({v1,2, v1,3, v2,3, v4, v6}, σ) are collapsible pairs in ∆n. Hence ({v1,2, v1,3, v2,3, v5, v6}, σ \
{v4}) and ({v1,2, v1,3, v2,3, v4, v6}, σ \ {v5}) are collapsible pairs in X1. Thus, σ \ {v4} ց
σ \ {v4, v6}, σ \ {v4, v5}, σ \ {v4, v1,2}, σ \ {v4, v1,3}, σ \ {v4, v2,3} and σ \ {v5} ց σ \ {v5, v4}, σ \
{v5, v6}, σ \ {v5, v1,2}, σ \ {v5, v1,3}, σ \ {v5, v2,3}.

Observe that σ \ {v4, v1,2}, σ \ {v5, v1,2} ⊆ N (v) ∪ N (v3), σ \ {v4, v1,3}, σ \ {v5, v1,3} ⊆ N (v) ∪
N (v2), σ \ {v4, v2,3}, σ \ {v5, v2,3} ⊆ N (v) ∪ N (v1). Therefore, we conclude that X1 collapses
to the subcomplex X2, where M (X2) = M (∆n) \ {σ} ∪ {σ \ {v4, v5}, σ \ {v4, v6}, σ \ {v5, v6}}.
Hence claim is true if n = 6. Let n ≥ 7 and inductively assume that ∆n collapses to the

subcomplex Xn−5, where

M (Xn−5) = M (∆n) \ {σ} ∪ {σ \ {vl1, vl2 , . . . , vln−5 } : {l1, l2, . . . , ln−5} ⊆ {4, 5, . . . , n − 1}}.
Let {i1, i2, . . . , in−5} ⊆ {4, 5, . . . , n−1}. Observe that |{4, 5, . . . , n−1, n}\{i1, i2, . . . , in−5}| =
2 and n ∈ {4, 5, . . . , n−1, n}\{i1, i2, . . . , in−5}. Let {n, p} = {4, 5, . . . , n−1, n}\{i1, i2, . . . , in−5}.
Using Lemma 4.10, we observe that σ \ {vi1 , . . . , vin−5 } is the only maximal simplex in Xn−5,
which contains {v1,2, v1,3, v2,3, vp, vn}. So, ({v1,2, v1,3, v2,3, vp, vn}, σ\{vi1 , . . . , vin−5 }) is a collap-
sible pair in Xn−5. Therefore σ\{vi1 , . . . , vin−5 } ց σ\{vi1 , . . . , vin−5 , vp}, σ\{vi1 , . . . , vin−5 , vn},
σ\{vi1 , . . . , vin−5 , v1,2}, σ\{vi1 , . . . , vin−5 , v1,3}, σ\{vi1 , . . . , vin−5 , v2,3}. Clearly, σ\{vi1 , . . . , vin−5 ,
v1,2} ⊆ N (v) ∪ N (v3), σ \ {vi1 , . . . , vin−5, v1,3} ⊆ N (v) ∪ N (v2), σ \ {vi1 , . . . , vin−5 , v2,3} ⊆
N (v) ∪ N (v1). Thus, we conclude that Xn−5 collapses to a subcomplex X ′

n−5, where

M (X ′

n−5) =M (∆n) \ {σ} ∪ {σ \ {vi1 , . . . , vin−5 , vp}, σ \ {vi1, . . . , vin−5 , vn}}∪

{σ \ {vl1, vl2 , . . . , vln−5} : {l1, l2, . . . , ln−5} ⊆ {4, 5, . . . , n − 1} \ {i1, . . . , in−5}}.

By applying an argument similar as above for each {l1, l2, . . . , ln−5} ⊆ {4, 5, . . . , n − 1}, we get
that Xn−5 collapses to the subcomplex Xn−4, where

M (Xn−4) = M (∆n) \ {σ} ∪ {σ \ {vl1 , vl2, . . . , vln−4 } : {l1, l2, . . . , ln−4} ⊆ {4, 5, . . . , n}}.

Observe that {σ\{vl1 , vl2, . . . , vln−4 } : {l1, l2, . . . , ln−4} ⊆ {4, 5, . . . , n}} = {K 1,2,3
i ∈ [n] \ {1, 2, 3}}. Thus, by induction we get that ∆n collapses to a subcomplex Xn−4, where

We are now ready to prove main theorem of this section.

Proof of Theorem C. We ﬁrst show that ∆n is 8-collapsible.
It is easy to check that each
maximal simplex of ∆4 is of dimension 7. Hence ∆4 is 8-collapsible. So assume that n ≥ 5.

n, where
M (∆′

{vi, vj, vk, vl} : v ∈ V (In), {i, j, k, l} ⊆ [n]}. Since n ≥ 5, by using the cardinalities of the

Choose a linear order ≺1 on elements of Bn. Extend ≺1 to a linear order ≺ on maximal
simplices of ∆′
n), if
σ1 ∈ Bn and σ2 ∈ Cn ∪ Dn, then σ1 ≺ σ2. Let τ ∈ ∆′
n. Let σ be the smallest (with respect to
≺) maximal simplex of ∆′
n such that τ ⊆ σ. If σ ∈ Cn ∪ Dn, then |σ| = 8 and thereby implying
that |M≺(τ )| ≤ 8. So assume that σ ∈ Bn. There exist v, w ∈ V (In) such that v ∼ w and
σ = N (v) ∪ N (w). We ﬁrst prove that |M≺(τ ) ∩ N (v)| ≤ 4.

Let mes≺(τ ) = (x1, . . . , xt). Suppose |M≺(τ )∩N (v)| ≥ 5. Let k be the least integer such that
|{x1, . . . , xk} ∩ N (v)| = 4. Clearly, k < t. Let {x1, . . . , xk} ∩ N (v) = {xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4}. Observe
that xk ∈ {xi1, xi2 , xi3, xi4}. Let γ be a maximal simplex such that γ ≺ σ. If {x1, . . . , xk} ∩
(σ \ γ) 6= ∅, then xk+1 ∈ {x1, . . . , xk}. Hence {x1, . . . , xk+1} ∩ N (v) = {xi1 , xi2, xi3, xi4}. If
{x1, . . . , xk} ∩ (σ \ γ) = ∅, then {xi1, xi2 , xi3, xi4} ⊆ γ. From Lemma 4.9, N (v) ⊆ γ. Thus
xk+1 /∈ N (v), thereby implying that {x1, . . . , xk+1} ∩ N (v) = {xi1 , xi2, xi3, xi4}. If k + 1 = t,
then we get a contradiction to the assumption that |M≺(τ )∩N (v)| ≥ 5. Inductively assume that
for all k ≤ l < t, {x1, . . . , xl} ∩ N (v) = {xi1, xi2 , xi3, xi4}. If {x1, . . . , xt−1} ∩ (σ \ γ) 6= ∅, then
xt ∈ {x1, . . . , xk}. Hence {x1, . . . , xt} ∩ N (v) = {xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4}. If {x1, . . . , xt−1} ∩ (σ \ γ) = ∅,
then {xi1, xi2, xi3, xi4} ⊆ γ. From Lemma 4.9, N (v) ⊆ γ. Thus xt /∈ N (v). Hence we get
that {x1, . . . , xt} ∩ N (v) = {xi1 , xi2, xi3, xi4}, which is a contradiction to the assumption that
|M≺(τ ) ∩ N (v)| ≥ 5. Thus |M≺(τ ) ∩ N (v)| ≤ 4.

By using an argument similar as above, |M≺(τ ) ∩ N (w)| ≤ 4. Since τ ⊆ N (v) ∪ N (w), we

see that M≺(τ ) ≤ 8. From Proposition 3.3, ∆n is 8-collapsible.

Let X be the Vietoris-Rips complex of a 4-dimensional cube subgraph of In. Then using
Lemma 4.8, there exists a retraction r : ∆n → X. Since X ∼= ∆4 and ∆4 ∼= S7, we see that
˜H7(X; Z) 6= 0. Further, since r∗ : ˜H7(∆n; Z) → ˜H7(X; Z) is surjective, ˜H7(∆n; Z) 6= 0. Using

4.3. Homology. The main aim of this section is to prove Theorem A. We ﬁrst establish a series
of lemmas, which we need to prove Theorem A. We always consider the reduced homology with
integer coeﬃcients.

For 1 ≤ i ≤ n and ǫ ∈ {0, 1}, let ∆i,ǫ

n = VR(Ii,ǫ

The following lemma play a key role in the proof of Theorem A.

Lemma 4.12. Let n ≥ 5 and let p ≤ n − 2. Then any p-cycle c in ∆n is homologous to a
p-cycle ˜c in ∂(∆n).

aiσi in ∆n, if ai 6= 0, then we say that σi ∈ z. For a cycle z
Proof. For any chain z =
in ∆n, let µ(z) = {σ ∈ z : σ /∈ ∂(∆n)}. Let c be a p-cycle in ∆n. If µ(c) = ∅, then c is a
p-cycle in ∂(∆n). Suppose µ(c) 6= ∅. We show that c is homologous to a p-cycle c1 such that
|µ(c1)| < |µ(c)|. Let σ ∈ c such that σ /∈ ∂(∆n), i.e., σ cover all places. Let τ be a maximal
simplex such that σ ⊆ τ . Using Lemmas 4.1, 4.3 and 4.6, we see that either τ = N (v) ∪ K i0,j0,k0
for some v and i0, j0, k0 ∈ [n] or τ = N (v) ∪ N (w) for some v ∼ w.

Let i ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0, k0}. Observe that for any x ∈ τ \ {vi}, x(i) = v(i). Since σ cover all places
and x(i) = v(i) for all x ∈ τ \ {vi}, we see that vi ∈ σ. Thus, {vi : i ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0, k0}} ⊆ σ.
Clearly, y(t) = v(t) for all y ∈ {vi : i ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0, k0}} and t ∈ {i0, j0, k0}. Since σ cover all
places and vi0,j0,k0 /∈ τ , we conclude that |σ| ≥ n − 1. Since p ≤ n − 2 and σ is p-dimensional,
we see that |σ| = n − 1.

Suppose v ∈ σ. Let {x0} = σ \ {{v} ∪ {vi : i ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0, k0}}}. For any t ∈ {i0, j0, k0} and
y ∈ {v} ∪ {vi : i ∈ [n] \ {i0, j0, k0}}, y(t) = v(t). Hence the fact that σ cover all places implies
that x0 = vi0,j0,k0, which is not possible since vi0,j0,k0 /∈ τ . So, v /∈ σ. Clearly, σ ∪ {v} ∈ ∆n.

Recall that for any simplex η, Bd(η) denotes the simplicial boundary of η. Let the coeﬃcient
of σ in c is (−1)maσ and the coeﬃcient of σ in Bd(σ ∪ {v}) is (−1)s. Deﬁne a p-cycle c1 as
follows:

c1 =

(

c − aσBd(σ ∪ {v})
c + aσBd(σ ∪ {v})

if m and s are of same parity,
if m and s are of opposite parity.

Clearly, c is homologous to c1. Observe that σ /∈ c1. Let γ ∈ c1 such that γ /∈ c. Then
observe that v ∈ γ and γ ⊆ τ . But we have seen above that if v ∈ γ, then γ ∈ ∂(∆n), i.e., γ
does not cover all places. Thus, we see that |µ(c1)| < |µ(c)|. Since |µ(c)| is ﬁnite, by repeating
the above argument ﬁnite number of times, we get a cycle ck such that c is homologous to ck
and |µ(ck)| = 0, i.e., ck is a p-cycle in ∂(∆n). We take ˜c = ck.

Case 2. τ = N (v) ∪ N (w).
For any k ∈ [n] and γ ∈ ∆n, we say that γ cover k-places, if there exist i1, . . . , ik ∈ [n] such

for each 1 ≤ l ≤ k, we get x, y ∈ γ such that x(il) = 0 and y(il) = 1.

Observe that if σ ⊆ N (v) or σ ⊆ N (w), then σ can cover at most p+1-places. Since n > p+1,
σ can not cover all places, a contradiction to the assumption that σ cover all places. Hence
N (v) ∩ σ 6= ∅ and N (w) ∩ σ 6= ∅.

Since w ∼ v, w = vq for some q ∈ [n]. Suppose v, w ∈ σ.

If N (w) ∩ σ = {v}, then
σ = {v, w, vi1 , . . . , vip−1 } for some i1, i2, . . . , ip−1 ∈ [n] \ {q}. Observe that σ cover only p-places,
namely i1, . . . , ip−1, q. Hence |N (w) ∩ σ| ≥ 2. Then σ = {v, w, vi1 , . . . , vis, vq,j1, . . . , vq,jt}, for
some i1, . . . , is, j1 . . . , jt ∈ [n], where s + t = p − 1. Here σ can cover at most p places, namely
i1, . . . , is, j1, . . . , jt, q and σ covers p places only if {i1, . . . , is} ∩ {j1, . . . , jt} = ∅. Since p < n, σ
does not cover all places. Hence {v, w} 6⊆ σ.

Suppose v ∈ σ. Then w /∈ σ.

If N (w) ∩ σ = {v}, then σ = {v, vi1 , . . . , vip} for some
i1, i2, . . . , ip ∈ [n]. Observe that σ cover only p-places, namely i1, . . . , ip. Hence |N (w) ∩ σ| ≥ 2.
Let σ = {v, vi1 , . . . , vis, vq,j1, . . . , vq,jt}, where i1, . . . , is, j1 . . . , jt ∈ [n] and s + t = p. Here σ
can cover at most p + 1 places, namely i1, . . . , is, j1, . . . , jt, q and σ covers p + 1 places only if
{i1, . . . , is} ∩ {j1, . . . , jt} = ∅, q /∈ {i1, . . . , is}. Thus, we conclude that v /∈ σ. By an argument
similar as above, w /∈ σ.

Let the coeﬃcient of σ in c is (−1)maσ and let the coeﬃcient of σ in Bd(σ ∪ {v}) is (−1)r.

Deﬁne a p-cycle d1 as follows:

d1 =

(

c − aσBd(σ ∪ {v})
c + aσBd(σ ∪ {v})

if m and r are of same parity,
if m and r are of opposite parity.

Clearly, c is homologous to d1 and |µ(d1)| < |µ(c)|. Since |µ(c)| is ﬁnite, by repeating the
above argument ﬁnite number of times, we get a cycle dk such that c is homologous to dk and
|µ(dk)| = 0. We take ˜c = dk.
This completes the proof.

and therefore contractible. From Proposition 4.13, X ≃ N({Xil,ǫl}). For any i, j ∈ [4] and
ǫ, δ ∈ {0, 1}, let {(i, ǫ), (j, δ)} be a simplicial complex on vertex set {(i, ǫ), (j, δ)}, which is

• if i 6= n, then X ⊆ VR(H; 3) for some (i + 1)-dimensional cube subgraph H of In.

Observe that for any i < n and an i-dimensional cube subgraph H of In, there exist two

Hence ˜Hj(X) = 0 for j ≤ 3. Let p ≥ 2. Inductively assume that for any l < p, i1, . . . , il ∈ [p]

for j ≤ 3. If Y ∩ Xp = ∅, then ˜Hj(X) = ˜Hj(Y ) ⊕ ˜Hj(Xp). Hence ˜Hj(X) = 0 for j ≤ 3. Let

any i-cycle c in Z is homologous to an i-cycle ˜c in ∂(Z) for i ≤ 3. Hence it is enough to show

If U ∩ Zq = ∅, then ˜Hj(Z) = ˜Hj(U ) ⊕ ˜Hj(Zq). By induction
hypothesis 2, ˜Hj(U ) = 0 and ˜Hj(Zq) = 0 for j ≤ 3. Hence ˜Hj(Z) = 0 for j ≤ 3. Let U ∩ Zq 6= ∅.
By Mayer-Vietoris sequence for homology, we have

j = 5, then since ˜H5(U ) = 0, ˜H5(Zq) = 0 and the map h4 : ˜H4(U ∩ Zq) −→ ˜H4(U ) ⊕ ˜H4(Zq) is
injective by Lemma 4.17, we get that ˜H5(Z) = 0.

(cid:3)

This completes the proof.

We are now ready to prove main result of this section.

Proof of Theorem A. Using Theorem C and Proposition 1.2, we see that ∆n is homotopy equiv-
alent to a subcomplex of dimension less than 8. Hence ˜Hi(∆n) = for all i ≥ 8. Let X be the
Vietoris-Rips complex of a 4-dimensional cube subgraph of In. Then using Lemma 4.8, there
exists a retraction r : ∆n → X. Since ∆4 ∼= S7 and X ∼= ∆4, we see that ˜H7(X) 6= 0. Further,
since r∗ : ˜H7(∆n) → ˜H7(X) is surjective, ˜H7(∆n) 6= 0.

If n ≤ 6, then result follows from Proposition 1.1. So assume that n ≥ 7. Since ∆n ∈ W n
n ,
Lemma 4.19 implies that ˜Hj(∆n) = 0 for j ∈ {5, 6}. Let Y be the Vietoris-Rips complex of a 5-
dimensional cube subgraph of In. From Lemma 4.8, there exists a retraction r1 : ∆n → Y . Since
Y ∼= ∆5, using Proposition 1.1 we conclude that ˜H4(∆n) 6= 0. From Lemma 4.15, ˜Hi(∆n) = 0
(cid:3)
for i ≤ 3. This completes the proof.

5. Future Directions

In Theorem A, we have shown that VR(In; 3) has non-trivial homology only in dimensions
4 and 7. Further, the complex VR(In; 2) is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of 3-spheres.
For r ∈ {2, 3}, since VR(In; 2) has non trivial homology only in dimension i ∈ {r + 1, 2r − 1},
we make the following conjecture.

Conjecture 1. For n ≥ r + 2, ˜Hi(VR(In; r); Z) 6= 0 if and only if i ∈ {r + 1, 2r − 1}.

The following is a natural question to ask.

Question 5.1. Let n ≥ r + 2. Is VR(In; r) homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of spheres of
dimensions r + 1 and 2r − 1 ?

In Theorems B and C, we have proved that the collapsibility number of the complex VR(In; r)

is 2r for r ∈ {2, 3}. This leads us to make the following conjecture.

Conjecture 2. For n ≥ r + 1, the collapsibility number of VR(In; r) is 2r.
