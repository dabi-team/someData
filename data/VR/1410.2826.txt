LIVSIC-TYPE DETERMINANTAL REPRESENTATIONS AND HYPERBOLICITY

E. SHAMOVICH AND V. VINNIKOV

ABSTRACT. Hyperbolic homogeneous polynomials with real coefﬁcients, i.e., hy-
perbolic real projective hypersurfaces, and their determinantal representations,
In this pa-
play a key role in the emerging ﬁeld of convex algebraic geometry.
per we consider a natural notion of hyperbolicity for a real subvariety X ⊂ Pd of
an arbitrary codimension ℓ with respect to a real ℓ − 1-dimensional linear subspace
V ⊂ Pd and study its basic properties. We also consider a special kind of determi-
nantal representations that we call Livsic-type and a nice subclass of these that we
call very reasonable. Much like in the case of hypersurfaces (ℓ = 1), the existence of
a deﬁnite Hermitian very reasonable Livsic-type determinantal representation im-
plies hyperbolicity. We show that every curve admits a very reasonable Livsic-type
determinantal representation. Our basic tools are Cauchy kernels for line bundles
and the notion of the Bezoutian for two meromorphic functions on a compact Rie-
mann surface that we introduce. We then proceed to show that every real curve in
Pd hyperbolic with respect to some real d − 2-dimensional linear subspace admits
a deﬁnite Hermitian, or even real symmetric, very reasonable Livsic-type determi-
nantal representation.

The study of hyperbolic polynomials originated with the theory of partial differ-
ential equations. A linear partial differential equation with constant coefﬁcients is
Pd(R) such that the symbol p, considered as a
called hyperbolic if there exists a
R for every
homogeneous polynomial, satisﬁes p(a)
Pd(R). This led G¨arding [19, 20] and Lax [30] to consider such polynomials
x
and the hypersurfaces X(R) =
they deﬁne. In particular,
G¨arding proved in [20] that if p is hyperbolic with respect to a as above then the
connected component C of a in Pd(R)
X(R) is convex and p is hyperbolic with
\
respect to any a′ in C (in the case when X is irreducible or X(R) is smooth, C
Pd(R) such that p is hyperbolic with respect to a′). More
simply consists of all a′
precisely, the cone over the set C in Rd+1 has two connected components, each
one a convex cone. During the last two decades these hyperbolicity cones came
to play an important role in optimization and related ﬁelds [8, 24, 37]. Among
other applications, hyperbolic polynomials played a key role in the recent proof
by Marcus, Spielman and Srivastava of the Kadison–Singer conjecture in operator
algebras [33].

A simple way to manufacture hyperbolic polynomials is to consider Hermitian
.
matrices A0, . . . Ad such that A0 > 0, and set p(x0, . . . , xd) = det
Then since A0 > 0, we see easily (using the fact the eigenvalues of a Hermitian
(cid:17)
matrix are real) that p is hyperbolic with respect to (1 : 0 : . . . : 0). Furthermore, the
Rd+1 : p(x)
is given by the linear
connected component of (1, 0, . . . , 0) in

j=0 xj Aj > 0, i.e., the hyperbolicity cone is a spectrahedral
cone [36] which is the feasible set of a semideﬁnite program, see [34, 35, 41] as
well as the recent survey volume [10]. In this case we say that p admits a deﬁnite
Hermitian determinantal representation.

Using the correspondence between determinantal representations and kernel
line bundles [42] that goes in its essence back to Dixon [15], and a detailed analy-
sis of the real structure of the corresponding Jacobian variety, it was shown by the
second author in [43] that for a smooth real hyperbolic curve in P2, deﬁnite de-
terminantal representations are parametrized by points on a certain distinguished
real torus in the Jacobian.
In particular, every smooth real hyperbolic curve in
P2 admits a deﬁnite determinantal representation, a fact established previously
by Dubrovin [16]. A technique using the Cauchy kernels for vector bundles was
developed in [7] (following [6]) to provide a construction of determinantal repre-
sentations for any plane algebraic curve. This technique was later used by Helton
and the second author in [26] to prove that every real hyperbolic plane curve ad-
mits a deﬁnite Hermitian and even a real symmetric determinantal representation,
settling a conjecture of Lax [30]. (The result in [26] is in the nonhomogeneous set-
ting of real zero polynomials — the explicit translation to the homogeneous setting
of hyperbolic polynomials and the connection to the Lax conjecture were worked
out in [31].)

If we consider hypersurfaces in Pd for d > 2, we immediately see by a count of
parameters argument [14] or by a Bertini theorem argument as in [9] that a generic
hypersurface does not admit a determinantal representation (except for quadrics
and cubics in P3). Determinantal representations of possibly singular and multiple
hypersurfaces in Pd were considered in details by Kerner and the second author
in [27] to which we also refer for further references. It was proved by Branden
in [11] that even if we allow multiplicity structure not every real hyperbolic hy-
persurface will admit a deﬁnite determinantal representation. We refer to [44] for
an up-to-date survey on deﬁnite determinantal representations of real hyperbolic
hypersurfaces and linear matrix inequality representations of the corresponding
hyperbolicity cones; see also [29] for a recent progress.

In Section 2 we deﬁne a special kind of determinantal representations that we
call Livsic-type determinantal representations that generalize both linear determi-
nantal representations of hypersurfaces and the determinantal representations of
curves considered in [32] in the context of multivariable operator theory and multi-
dimensional systems (vessels). We then show that a speciﬁc subclass of Livsic-type
determinantal representations, that we call very reasonable, has especially nice
properties. In particular, if X admits a very reasonable Livsic-type determinantal
representation, then the associated hypersurface Y in the Grassmanian G(ℓ

Equivalently, every real 1-dimensional Schubert cycle through V in the Grassma-

connected component C(V ) of V in G(ℓ
Y (R) has a natural convex-
ity property that we call slice-convexity, and that X is hyperbolic with respect to
any V ′
C(V ). It is an open question whether C(V ) (more precisely any of the
two connected components of the cone over it in the Pl¨ucker embedding) has a
different property of being extendably convex in the sense of Buseman [12] (an
intersection of a convex set in the ambient space with the image of the Grassma-
nian), or whether, in the case when X is irreducible or when X(R) is smooth, C(V )
coincides with the set of all ℓ
1-dimensional real linear subspaces V ′ so that X is
hyperbolic with respect to V ′.

We also demonstrate that if X admits a very reasonable Livsic-type determinan-

tal representations that is deﬁnite Hermitian, then X is hyperbolic.

Sections 4–7 are dedicated to Livsic-type determinantal representations and hy-
perbolicity for curves in Pd. While our methods are a generalization of the methods
used in [7] and [26], it is both more natural and more convenient to set them in
the framework of Bezoutians on a compact Riemann surface.

In Section 4 we introduce the notion of a Bezoutian of two meromorphic func-
tions with simple poles on a compact Riemann surface; this notion originated in the
study of Hankel-type realizations for meromorphic bundle maps on a compact Rie-
mann surface as transfer functions of overdetermined 2D systems (vessels) [5], and
seems to be appropriate for studying localization of zeroes just as in the classical
(genus zero) case. Similar notions of resultants of meromorphic functions on a Rie-
mann surface were considered by Gustafsson and Tkachev in [?] and [?]. We limit
ourselves to proving several basic properties of the Bezoutian that are essential for
our purposes here, and postpone a more general development of the theory and ap-
plications (as well as clarifying the relation to the work of Shapiro and the second
author [38–40]) to a future publication. In Section 5 we consider Bezoutians on
compact real Riemann surfaces (a Riemann surface equipped with an antiholomor-
phic involution τ or equivalently the desingularization of a real algebraic curve)
and in particular on those of dividing type. We show how the Bezoutian relates
to dividing functions, i.e., real meromorphic functions that map a half of the com-
pact real Riemann surfaces of dividing type onto the upper half plane and that are
closely related to the hyperbolicity of the Riemann surface birationally embedded
as an algebraic curve in a projective space.

In Section 6 we use the Bezoutians to show that every curve X

Pd admits
a very reasonable Livsic-type determinantal representations, generalizing the con-
struction of [7] in the case d = 2 and (essentially) the construction of Kravitsky [28]
(see also [32]) in the case of rational curves (genus zero). Finally, in Section 7 we
extend the results of [26] in the case d = 2: we show that every curve X in Pd
Pd
hyperbolic with respect to some d
admits a deﬁnite Hermitian and even real symmetric very reasonable Livsic-type

determinantal representation. Furthermore, when X is irreducible, the set of all
1, d)(R) such that X is hyperbolic with respect to V ′ is given by a linear
V ′
matrix inequality (in the coordinates of the Pl¨ucker embedding).

∈
Our terminology is quite standard. All our varieties are over the ﬁeld C of com-
plex numbers, are reduced unless explicitly stated otherwise, and we identify the
Pd is a real sub-
variety with the set of its (closed) points over C. We say that X
variety if X is deﬁned over the reals (i.e., by homogeneous polynomial equations
with real coefﬁcients); we then denote by X(R) the set of points of X that are ra-
tional over R (i.e., have real coordinates). When we consider the dimension or the
codimension of X we assume that X has pure dimension (i.e., all the irreducible
components of X have the same dimension) unless the converse is explicitly speci-
ﬁed. We denote by G(m, d) the Grassmanian of m-dimensional linear subspaces in
the d-dimensional projective space Pd.

We will assume that Cd+1 is equipped with the standard scalar product. For V a
subspace in Cd1 we will write V ⊥ for the orthogonal complement of V ; note that if
a subspace is real then so is its orthogonal complement. For most of our purposes
V ⊥ could have been replaced by any complementary subspace, but the use of the
orthogonal complement will streamline some proofs and simplify notations. We
will also use the standard scalar product to identify Cd1 with its dual, a fact that we
will use later both implicitly and explicitly.

onal projection onto it with respect to the standard scalar product on Rd+1. Then
the distance between two spaces is the norm of the difference of the associated

the distance between each two consecutive points will be less than ǫ/ℓ. Therefore
by the triangle inequality they are all contained in the ball with radius ǫ around V .
This shows that the set of witnesses contains the ball with radius ǫ/2√2ℓ around V

Hyperbolicity of hypersurfaces has been studied extensively since the notion was

introduced. A few analogous questions arise in our setting.

Consider the Grassmannian embedded in PN via the Pl¨ucker embedding. This
embedding is projectively normal and since Pic(G(ℓ
1, d)) ∼= Z we obtain that
every hypersurface in the Grassmannian is obtained via an intersection with a hy-
persurface in PN .
In a series of works H. Buseman discussed various notions of
convexity of a subset of the cone over Grassmannian (in the Pl¨ucker embedding),
e.g. [12]. In particular he calls extendably convex those sets in the cone that are
intersections with convex sets in the ambient space.
Question 3.13. Let X be an irreducible real variety in Pd with codim X = ℓ >
1 and let Y

Remark 4.2. In particular note that due to cancellation of the constant factors of
automorphy appearing when we change the choice of ˜pj, we get that the formula is
independent of the choice of those lifts.

This leads us to the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 4.3. We deﬁne the Bezoutian of the functions f and g with respect to
the divisor D as the matrix Bχ,D(f, g).

One can see immediately from the proof that is D

D′ are two effective re-
(D), then Bχ,D(f, g) is a submatrix of Bχ,D′
duced divisors on X and f, g
and furthermore Bχ,D′ (f, g) is obtained by padding Bχ,D(f, g) with zeroes to the
required size.

∈ L

≤

There are a few choices made in the construction of the Bezoutian matrix.
Changing the lifts of the pj will result in the conjugation of Bχ,D(f, g) by diagonal
unitary matrices of the constant factors of automorphy of χ. Similarly changes in
coordinates result in conjugation by the respective matrices of transition functions.

The following corollary is immediate from the deﬁnition of the Bezoutian:

Proof. If ϕ(χ) is a half-period and it is off the theta divisor, it must be an even

K(χ, q, p) in this case. Therefore

bχ(f, g)(p, q) = bχ(f, g)(q, p) and thus the resulting Bezoutian is symmetric.

5. REAL RIEMANN SURFACES AND DIVIDING FUNCTIONS

In this section we’ll keep the notations from the previous section and assume
that X is equipped with an anti-holomorphic involution τ . Set X(R) the set of
X(R) has two connected
ﬁxed points of τ . Recall that X is called dividing if X

The following proposition is in fact contained in [2] and [1], we will recall the

proof for the sake of completeness.

Proposition 5.2. Let f be a dividing function on X, then it has only simple poles and
zeroes and its residues at the poles, with respect to a real local coordinate with positive
orientation, are negative. Conversely, if X is dividing and f is a real meromorphic
function on X with simple real poles and negative residues with respect to positive real
local coordinate, then f is dividing.

X(R). Let t be a real local coordinate centered
Proof. Let p be a zero of f , then p
at p. We note that if we have a zero of higher order that f (t) = atk + . . ., hence
if t is small enough it can not preserve the part of the disc with positive imaginary
part, unless k = 1. Since if f is dividing then so is
1/f , hence a similar conclusion
applies to poles.

−

∈

In order to prove the second part of the claim we ﬁx a real positively oriented

local coordinate t at a pole, then:

tf (t) = a.

lim
t
→−

Since the limit exists in particular the limit exists when we approach 0 along the
positive imaginary axis. Then the imaginary part of f (t) is also positive by assump-
tion and hence the real part of tf (t) is always negative, and hence so is the limit.

Conversely, assume that f is a real meromorphic function on X with simple real
poles and negative residues with respect to positive real local coordinate. Then

22

E. SHAMOVICH AND V. VINNIKOV

Im(f ) is a harmonic function on X+ and it vanishes at every point of the boundary,
except for the poles. The above limit argument shows that in fact for a positively
oriented coordinate the imaginary part of f is positive on X+ near the poles. There-
fore, from the minimum and maximum principle for harmonic functions it follows
(cid:3)
that Im(f ) > 0 on X+.

Remark 5.3. Another way to see that the residues are negative is as follows. Let p
be a simple pole of f and t again a real positive local coordinate centered at p. Write
the Laurent expansion of f with respect to t: f (t) = a/t + b + . . .. We have that if
Im t > 0, then the sign of Im(a/t) is the opposite of the sign of a, so for t of very small
modulus we conclude that a has to be negative.

Let us assume from now on that X is dividing and X(R) has k components,
1. We can pullback τ to an anti-holomorphic involution on ˜X, we’ll
X0, . . . , Xk
denote the pullback by τ as well. We recall the construction of a special sym-
metric basis for the homology of X from [43]. We take a point si on Xi and for

From now let us assume that C is a real curve, then the involution on Pd obtained
from complex conjugation of coordinates, induces an anti-holomorphic involution
on X. Note that dim H 0(X,
) is the
subspace spanned by the real sections µ0, . . . , µd, then in fact ι is a map from X to
PW ∗. We identify PW ∗ with PW , by setting the basis µ0, . . . , µd to be orthonormal.
Furthermore a section ν
W is real if and only if it is a linear combination of
the µj with real coefﬁcients. Let us assume that there exists a real linear subspace

Proof. Consider V

Then every real hypersurface containing V is spanned by sµ0 + tµ1 and V , where

Now if V is spanned by real sections ν2, . . . , νd. We can complete this set to

hyperbolicity is invariant under real coordinate changes, we see that we get the

This discussion leads us to the main result of this section.

2-dimensional linear subspace U

Theorem 7.2. The curve C admits very reasonable Hermitian Livsic type determinan-
tal representations γ, parametrized by ﬂat unitary line bundles in T0, a real subtorus
of the Jacobian variety of the desingularizing Riemann surface of C, such that for ev-
Pd, we have that γ(U ) is deﬁnite if and
ery real d
only if C is hyperbolic with respect to U . In particular if the line bundle is two-torsion,
then the resulting determinantal representation is real symmetric.
Proof. Fix χ a ﬂat unitary line bundle on T0, by [43, Cor. 4.3] h0(χ
∆) = 0.
Then by Proposition 5.6, we have that each γij is Hermitian, since the λj are real
functions with real poles.

It sufﬁces to prove that if C is hyperbolic with respect to U then γ(U ) is deﬁnite,
since the converse has already been proved. However, we note that by Lemma
6.1 we have that for every such U there exist two functions κ0 and κ1, such that
by Lemma 7.1 λ = κ1/κ0 is dividing. Since γ is very reasonable we note that
implies that γ(U ) is invertible. Now we note that γ(U ) = Bχ,D(κ0, κ1)
U
and hence we can apply Proposition 5.7 to get the result. To get a real symmetric
(cid:3)
representation apply Propostion 4.5.

If C admits a very reasonable Hermitian Livsic type determinantal representa-
tion γ, then so does the hypersurface, Y , corresponding to it via the incidence
correspondence. Now we can lift the determinantal representation to some hyper-
PN . If C is hyperbolic with respect to some real d
surface, Y ′(γ)
2-dimensional
⊂
Pd, then by the above theorem γ(V ) is deﬁnite; we conclude
linear subspace V
that Y ′(γ) is hyperbolic with respect to V . On the other hand if Y ′(γ) is hyperbolic
with respect to V then so is Y , and thus by Proposition 3.5 C is hyperbolic with
respect to V ; applying the theorem again we see that γ(V ) is deﬁnite. Therefore
we obtain:
