We present the results of the blazar 3C 345 monitoring in Johnson-Cousins BV RI bands for the period 1996 – 2006.
We have collected 29 V and 43 R data points for this period; the BI light curves contain a few measurements only. The
accuracy of our photometry is not better than 0.03 mag in the V R bands. The total amplitude of the variability obtained
from our data is 2.06 mag in the V band and 2.25 mag in the R one. 3C 345 showed periods of ﬂaring activity during
1998/99 and 2001: a maximum of the blazar brightness was detected in 2001 February – 15.345 mag in the V band and
14.944 mag in the R one. We conﬁrm that during brighter stages 3C 345 becomes redder; for higher ﬂuxes the colour
index seems to be less dependent on the magnitude. The intra-night monitoring of 3C 345 in three consecutive nights in
2001 August revealed no signiﬁcant intra-night variability; 3C 345 did not show evident ﬂux changes over timescales of
weeks around the period of the intra-night monitoring. This result supports the existing facts that intra-night variability is
correlated with rapid ﬂux changes rather than with speciﬁc ﬂux levels.

1 Introduction

Blazars are a sub-class of active galactic nuclei (see the re-
view paper of Angel & Stockman 1980). The most notable
feature of blazars is their violent variability at all wave-
lengths on time scales from about an hour or less to years.
It is now believed that the physical processes in relativistic
jets are responsible for the observed behaviour of blazars
(e.g. Schramm et al. 1993a; Wagner et al. 1995; Otterbein
et al. 1998; Lobanov & Roland 2005).

The violent variability of blazars is very helpful in un-
derstanding their nature; so, they were targets of a num-
ber of monitoring campaigns like Hamburg Quasar Moni-
toring (HQM; Borgeest & Schramm 1994; Schramm et al.
1994a, 1994b) in the past and Whole Earth Blazar Telescope
(WEBT) in the present days. In particular, the international
coordinated programme WEBT proved to be very effective
in obtaining blazar light curves of dense temporal coverage
(e.g. Villata et al. 2006).

We started to monitor selected blazars with the 2.0-m
telescope of the Rozhen National Astronomical Observa-
tory (NAO), Bulgaria, in 1996 inspired by Dr. K.-J. Schramm
and following the international collaborations MEGAPHOT
(Schramm et al. 1993b) and Joint Optical Monitoring Pro-
gramme of Quasars (JOMPQ; Schramm et al. 1994c). The

blazar 3C 345 (1641+399, z = 0.5928) is among the most
highly variable blazars in our list. Regular photometric mon-
itoring of 3C 345 has been carried out since 1965; the his-
torical light curve of the source was constructed and studied
by Schramm et al. (1993a), Zhang et al. (1998) and Howard
et al. (2004, hereafter H04). We present in this paper the re-
sults of our monitoring of the blazar 3C 345 for the period
1996 – 2006.

Another aim of this study is to present our results of the
intra-night monitoring of 3C 345; note that the character-
istics of 3C 345 intra-night variability are not well estab-
lished. Kidger (1989) was the ﬁrst one who drew attention
to the intra-night variability of 3C 345: he detected ﬂicker-
ing on time scales of hours with amplitudes of about 0.1 –
0.2 mag. Furthermore, Kidger & de Diego (1990) reported
0.47 B mag brightness drop in 13 minutes, whereas H04 de-
tected no signiﬁcant intra-night variability; H04 found that
the occurrences of intra-night variability are correlated tem-
porally with long-term optical activity of the objects stud-
ied. Thus, intra-night monitoring of 3C 345 was undertaken
by us in order to shed more light on the intra-night variabil-
ity characteristics of this source.

The paper is organized as follows. The observations and
data reduction are described in Sect. 2. The photometry and
resulting light curves are presented in Sect. 3. The results
are discussed in Sect. 4. A brief summary of our results is
presented in Sect. 5.

2 Observations and data reduction

The observational data of 3C 345 were obtained using the
2.0-m Ritchey-Chr´etien and the 0.5/0.7-m Schmidt telescopes

of NAO, the 0.6-m Cassegrain telescope of the Belograd-
chik Astronomical Observatory (BAO), Bulgaria, and the
1.3-m Ritchey-Chr´etien telescope of the Skinakas Observa-
tory (SO), Crete, Greece. Standard Johnson-Cousins BV RI
ﬁlters were used in all observations. Focal reducers were oc-
casionally used at NAO (FoReRo) and BAO. The following
CCD cameras were used as detectors of the 2.0-m telescope
of NAO: 375 × 242 SBIG ST-6, 1024 × 1024 Photomet-
rics AT200, and 1340×1300 Princeton Instruments VersAr-
ray:1300B. The CCD cameras ST-6 and VersArray:1300B
were used in single nights: 1996 August 12/13 and 2005
March 12/13, respectively. The 0.5/0.7-m telescope of NAO
and the 0.6-m telescope of BAO were equipped with identi-
cal 1530 × 1020 SBIG ST-8 CCD cameras. The 1.3-m tele-
scope of SO was equipped with 1024 × 1024 Photometrics
CCD camera.

Multiple V R frames of the 3C 345 ﬁeld were taken in
each night allocated for the monitoring; BI frames were
taken occasionally. Twilight ﬂat ﬁeld, zero exposure, and
dark current frames were taken as well. Dark frames were

taken when ST-6/8 CCD cameras were used and zero frames
were taken in the case of the other cameras. The binning
factor of the CCD cameras was changed depending on the
observing conditions.

The intra-night monitoring of 3C 345 was performed
at BAO by RB during three nights of 2001 August: 18/19,
19/20, and 20/21. The blazar was imaged through V RI ﬁl-
ters for a period of about 3 – 4 hours each night; the expo-
sures were 120 sec for all passbands.

Reduction of the 3C 345 frames was done depending
on the CCD camera used: ST-6/8 CCD data were dark sub-
tracted and ﬂat ﬁelded using the camera software, whereas
the data acquired by means of the other cameras were de-
biased and ﬂat ﬁelded using ESO-MIDAS package. The cos-
mic ray hits were cleaned and the individual frames were
aligned and co-added using ESO-MIDAS. The frames ob-
tained in the course of the intra-night monitoring were dark
subtracted and ﬂat ﬁelded only.

3 Photometry and light curves

We used differential photometry technique to obtain the 3C 345
light curves in order to be independent of the photometric
conditions. Field stars #4 and #19, calibrated by Gonz´alez-
P´erez, Kidger & Mart´ın-Luis (2001), were used as a control
star and as a reference one, respectively (see Table 1 and
Fig. 1). Stars #4 and #19 are designated as D and E, respec-
tively, in Smith’s et al. (1985) paper.

The ﬂux measurements of all objects of interest were
performed using DAOPHOT package (Stetson 1987) run
within ESO-MIDAS. Instrumental magnitudes were mea-
sured through a set of apertures with radii of 1/2/3×FWHM
pixels; the sky background value was estimated in a centred
annulus with an inner radius of 7 × FWHM pixels and con-
taining 1000 pixels. The calibrated magnitudes of 3C 345
were calculated relative to star #19 without taking into ac-
count the colour term in the transformation equations; the
light curves of star #4 were obtained in the same way as the
blazar ones and were used to estimate the accuracy of the
photometry.

We adopted as ﬁnal magnitudes the ones measured through

1 × FWHM radius aperture – using this aperture the control
star light curves show the smallest clipped standard devia-
tion in all passbands. The 3σ clipping technique was used
to eliminate the deviant data points – if such are present –
in the control star light curve under the assumption of the
control and reference star non-variability. The blazar data
points corresponding to the eliminated control star points
were also eliminated. We got a total of three V band and
three R band data points removed from the light curves by
this technique. The formal errors of the ﬁnal blazar and con-
trol star magnitudes include the errors of the instrumental
magnitudes as returned by DAOPHOT and the errors of the
standard magnitudes of reference star #19.

The nightly weight-mean V RI magnitudes of the blazar
were obtained from the intra-night data and added to the

nitudes were calculated taking the larger between (1) the er-
ror estimate based on the individual magnitude errors, and
(2) the error estimate based on the scatter of magnitudes in-
volved in averaging about their weight-mean value.

The measured light curves of 3C 345 are tabulated in
Table 2 (B band), Table 3 (V band), Table 4 (R band), and
Table 5 (I band) and are presented in Fig. 2 (V band) and
in Fig. 3 (R band). The ﬁnal light curves contain a total of
4 data points in the B band, 29 – in the V band, 43 – in
the R band, and 6 – in the I band. The Universal Time is
taken at the middle of each (B)V R(I) observing set; Julian
Days are geocentric. The telescopes used are abbreviated in
a self-explanatory way in the tables. The sufﬁx FR used in
the tables means that focal reducer has been employed.

Note that due to the small number of BI data points the
computed throughout the paper statistical parameters of the
blazar and control star BI light curves are approximate and
should be used with care.

sequently, the systematic errors introduced due to the colour
term skipping in magnitude calculation are rather negligi-
ble.

The standard deviations of the control star BV RI light
curves are 0.014 mag, 0.033 mag, 0.031 mag, and 0.013
mag, respectively. We found that the standard deviations of
the V R bands are larger than the mean formal errors of the
calibrated 3C 345 V R magnitudes by factors of 2.7 and 2.1,

respectively. Based on the scatter of the control star magni-
tudes, we conclude that the accuracy of our V R photometry
is not better than 0.03 mag; actually, the accuracy should be
worse because control star #4 was brighter than the blazar
during the monitoring period.

4.2 V − R colour index

The V − R colour index dependence on the R magnitude is
plotted in Fig. 4. Using a weighted linear ﬁt in the interval
of the R magnitudes fainter than R0 = 15.5 mag, we got
the following anti-correlation

V − R = (2.242 ± 0.226) − (0.114 ± 0.014)R,
with a correlation coefﬁcient r = −0.718, i.e. during the
brighter stages 3C 345 becomes redder. The cut-off mag-
nitude R0 was introduced by us as the dependence of the
colour index on the ﬂux seems to be less pronounced for
brighter stages of the source (see Fig. 4). The value of R0
was determined by eye and should be considered as approx-
imate because the region where the “colour index – mag-
nitude” relation changes its slope is not well covered with
data points. Schramm’s et al. (1993a) Fig. 4 could be re-
garded as a support in favour of the cut-off magnitude intro-
duction. However, the presence of a cut-off magnitude is not
so obvious inspecting Zhang’s et al. (2000) “colour index –
magnitude” ﬁgures.

Fitting over the entire range of magnitudes, we got
V − R = (1.762 ± 0.179) − (0.085 ± 0.011)R,

Fig. 6

The same as in Fig. 5, but for the R band.

with a correlation coefﬁcient r = −0.734. In this case the
ﬁtted coefﬁcients are in good agreement with those obtained
by Schramm et al. (1993a) who used 1991/92 data and by
Zhang et al. (2000) who used 1991/92 and 1996/97 data.

4.3 Intra-night variability

The V RI intra-night monitoring light curves are presented
in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, and Fig. 7, respectively. No signiﬁcant
intra-night variability patterns or gradients could be identi-
ﬁed by eye. To quantify the intra-night variability of 3C 345
we used the variability parameter C proposed by Jang &
Miller (1997). Given the standard deviations of the blazar
and of the control star light curves, σ(3C 345) and σ(star #4),
respectively, the variability parameter is deﬁned as

C =

σ(3C 345)
σ(star #4)

.

If C > C0 (C0 = 2.576), then the source is consid-
ered variable at the 99% conﬁdence level. Note that for the
period of the intra-night monitoring the blazar and the con-
trol star were of compatible brightness; so, the parameter
C cannot be a subject to signiﬁcant systematic errors due
to the different ﬂux densities of the objects considered. A
further complication of the above simple criterion for vari-
ability could be considered when multi-colour observations
are available: one could expect correlated variations in dif-
ferent passbands to be observed, i.e. the median value of C
over all passbands for a given night to be larger than C0. The
criterion C > C0 was met in the ﬁrst night (C = 2.7 in the
R band) and in the third night (C = 2.9 in the V band) of

tions used by H04 were performed when 3C 345 was fainter
compared to the period of our intra-night observations.

4.4 Long-term variability

the intra-night monitoring. However, the computed median
values of C over the V RI bands are 1.6, 1.0, and 2.1 for the
consecutive nights, respectively. So, we could conclude that
for the period of the intra-night monitoring 3C 345 did not
show signiﬁcant intra-night variations.

The gradients of the V R long-term light curves for the
period 2001 July/August, i.e. around the dates of the intra-
night monitoring, are −0.32 ± 0.07 and −0.29 ± 0.06 mag
per year, respectively; the weight-mean magnitudes com-
puted for the nights of intra-night monitoring were also in-
cluded in the gradient calculation. The gradients were esti-
mated using a weighted linear ﬁt to the 2001 July/August
V R data points; this part of the light curves and the cor-
responding ﬁts are presented in Fig. 8. The standard de-
viations of the V R long-term light curves for the period
2001 July/August are 0.026 and 0.023 mag, respectively;
the same data points were used as in the gradient calcula-
tion. Therefore, 3C 345 did not show signiﬁcant ﬂux changes
over timescales of weeks around the period of the intra-
night monitoring1. This result is in agreement with H04’s
conclusion that the presence of intra-night variability occurs
more frequently while the ﬂux is changing. We observed
no evident intra-night variability while the source was in a
bright stage. This supports H04’s ﬁnding of no correlation
between the presence/absence of intra-night variability and
the ﬂux level of sources; the intra-night variability observa-

1 One could see that 2001 July/August part of the long-term light curves
is not well sampled; so, our conclusion should be used with some caution:
its truthfulness depends on the blazar behaviour during the gaps in our
monitoring.

One could see from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 that 3C 345 was in a
bright stage during 1998/99 and 2001, i.e. the blazar showed
periods of ﬂaring activity. In particular, a maximum in 3C 345
brightness was detected in 2001 February: 15.345 mag in
the V band and 14.944 mag in the R one – values com-
patible with the 1991/92 outburst ones (see Schramm et al.
1993a). Another ﬂare of brightness could be seen at the
end of July 2006. Unfortunately, our measurements are too
sparse to be able to follow the individual ﬂares accurately.

The total amplitude of variability detected by us for the
period 1996 – 2006 is 1.40 mag in the B band, 2.06 mag in
the V band, 2.25 mag in the R band and 1.00 mag in the I
band; one should keep in mind the very different sampling
of BI and V R light curves.

The high brightness level observed during 2001 is in
agreement with Zhang’s et al. (1998) prediction that the fol-
lowing large outburst of 3C 345 should be at its maximum
around 2002 January. This prediction was made on the basis
of the period of 10.1 ± 0.8 years found by them.

5 Summary

We have presented the results of the blazar 3C 345 monitor-
ing in Johnson-Cousins BV RI bands for the period 1996 –
2006. The total amplitude of variability obtained out of our
data is 2.06 mag in the V band and 2.25 mag in the R one.
3C 345 showed periods of ﬂaring activity during 1998/99
and 2001: a maximum of the blazar brightness was detected
in 2001 February – 15.345 mag in the V band and 14.944
mag in the R one. The intra-night monitoring of 3C 345 in
three consecutive nights in 2001 August did not reveal sig-
niﬁcant intra-night variability.

Our measurements should be considered as a part of the
international efforts aimed to obtain a dense temporal cov-
erage of the light curve of 3C 345. The availability of well
sampled multi-frequency light curves is of importance to
reveal the source of the blazar activity (e.g. Schramm et al.
1993a; Lobanov & Roland 2005).

The tabulated long-term BV RI and intra-night V RI
light curves of 3C 345 and of star #4 could be found at
www.astro.bas.bg/∼bmihov.

The European Southern Observatory Munich Image Data Anal-
ysis System (ESO-MIDAS) is developed and maintained by the
European Southern Observatory.

The design and manufacturing of the the Focal Reducer Rozhen
(FoReRo) were performed in the workshop of the Institute of As-
tronomy, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, with ﬁnancial support
by the Ministry of Education and Science, Bulgaria (contract F-
482/2201).
