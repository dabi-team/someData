Abstract—In this paper, we study the optimal

transmis-
sion of a multi-quality tiled 360 virtual reality (VR) video
from a multi-antenna server (e.g., access point or base
station) to multiple single-antenna users in a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiple
access (OFDMA) system. We minimize the total transmission
power with respect to the subcarrier allocation constraints, rate
allocation constraints, and successful transmission constraints, by
optimizing the beamforming vector and subcarrier, transmission
power and rate allocation. The formulated resource allocation
problem is a challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization
problem. We obtain an asymptotically optimal solution in the
case of a large antenna array, and a suboptimal solution in the
general case. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst work providing
optimization-based design for 360 VR video transmission in
MIMO-OFDMA systems. Finally, by numerical results, we show
that the proposed solutions achieve signiﬁcant improvement in
performance compared to the existing solutions.

I. INTRODUCTION

By using an omnidirectional camera to capture a scene
of interest in all directions at the same time, a 360 virtual
reality (VR) can be generated. In many VR applications,
e.g., VR gaming, VR concert, and VR military training,
a 360 VR video has to be transmitted to multiple users
simultaneously. Transmitting a 360 VR video over wireless
networks enables users to experience immersive environments
without geographical or behavioral restrictions. In this paper,
the main focus is on optimally transmitting a 360 VR video
in a multi-user wireless network.

A 360 VR video has a much larger size than a traditional
video. When watching a 360 VR video, a user is perceiv-
ing it from only one viewing direction at any time, which
corresponds to one part of the 360 VR video, known as ﬁeld-
of-view (FoV). Tiling technique is widely used to improve the
transmission efﬁciency for 360 VR videos [1]. Transmitting
the set of tiles which cover predicted FoVs can reduce
the required communication resources, without affecting the
quality of experience. When transmitting a tiled 360 VR video
in a multi-user wireless network, if there exists a tile required
by multiple users concurrently, multicast opportunities can be
utilized to improve transmission efﬁciency. Recently, [2]–[7]
study streaming of a tiled 360 VR video from a single-antenna
server to multiple single-antenna users in wireless networks,
where multicast opportunities are exploited. In particular, in

our previous works [2], [3], the optimal transmission of a
single-quality tiled 360 VR video is studied. In practice, pre-
encoding each tile into multiple representations with different
quality levels allows quality adaptation according to users’
channel conditions. In [4]–[7], the optimal transmission of a
multi-quality tiled 360 VR video is considered, with the main
focus on the optimization of quality level selection for each
tile.

Despite the fruitful research in the literature, the perfor-
mance of wireless transmission of a tiled 360 VR video is
still limited. In fact, the results in [2]–[7] all consider single-
antenna servers, which cannot exploit
the spatial degrees
of freedom. The performance of wireless systems can be
signiﬁcantly improved by deploying multiple antennas at a
server and designing efﬁcient beamformers. Among various
multi-antenna technologies, MIMO-OFDMA is the dominant
air interface for 5G broadband wireless communications, as
it can provide more reliable communications at high speeds.
For instance, in [8], [9], the authors consider multi-group
multicast in MIMO-OFDMA systems. Speciﬁcally, In [8], the
subcarrier and power allocation is considered to maximize
the system sum rate. However, the solution proposed in [8] is
heuristic, and hence has no performance guarantee. In [9], the
authors study the optimization of beamformers to minimize
the total transmission power, and obtain a stationary point of
the beamforming design problem based on successive convex
approximation. Note that in [9], messages on each subcarrier
have different beamformers, resulting in a substantial increase
in the number of variables and hence the computational
complexity for solving the optimization problem.

In this paper, we consider the optimal

transmission of
a multi-quality tiled 360 VR video in a MIMO-OFDMA
system. With more advanced physical layer techniques than
those in [2]–[7], we expect the stringent requirements for 360
VR video transmission to be better satisﬁed. We minimize
the total transmission power by optimizing the beamforming
vectors and subcarrier, transmission power, and rate allocation,
under the subcarrier allocation constraints, rate allocation con-
straints, and successful transmission constraints. This problem
is a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, and
is very challenging. We obtain its asymptotically optimal
solution in the special case of a large antenna array, by
exploiting decomposition, continuous relaxation, and Karush-
Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. We also obtain a suboptimal
solution in the general case, applying continuous relaxation
and difference of convex (DC) programming. Note that the

transmission of a tiled 360 VR video in this paper can be
viewed as multi-group multicast. Previous works studying
in MIMO-OFDMA systems do not
multi-group multicast
investigate the special case of a large antenna array where
an asymptotically optimal solution can be obtained [8], [9].
Note that the proposed formulation in this paper, with one
beamforming vector for each subcarrier, can achieve the same
performance as the formulation in [9] but with much lower
computational complexity in the general case. Finally, numer-
ical results show substantial gains achieved by the proposed
solutions over existing schemes.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

,

We consider the streaming of a multi-quality tiled 360
VR video from a server (e.g., access point or base station)
to K users in an MIMO-OFDMA system as illustrated in
Fig. 1.1 The server is equipped with M transmit antennas
and each user wears a single-antenna VR headset. Denote
as the set of user indices. When a VR user
K
is interested in one viewing direction of a 360 VR video, the
user watches a rectangular FoV of size Fh
rad),
the center of which is referred to as the viewing direction. In
addition, a user can freely switch views when watching a 360
VR video.

Tiling is adopted to improve transmission efﬁciency of the
360 VR video. In particular, the 360 VR video is divided
into multiple rectangular segments of the same size, which
are referred to as tiles. Let Uh and Uv denote the numbers

(e.g., display resolutions of devices, channel conditions, etc.),
each tile is pre-encoded into L representations corresponding
to L quality levels using High Efﬁciency Video Coding
(HEVC), as in Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
(DASH). Denote
as the set of quality levels.
For all l
, the l-th representation of each tile corresponds
to the l-th lowest quality. For ease of exposition, we assume
that the encoding rates of the tiles with the same quality level
are identical. Let Dl (in bits/s) denote the encoding rate of the
l-th representation of a tile. Note that D1 < D2 < . . . < DL.
We consider the duration of the playback time of one group
of pictures (GOP),2 over which the FoV of each user does not
change. Let rk
denote the quality level for the FoV of

that Problem 3 is a nonconvex problem due to the rank-one

Substituting Q†(M)

S,l,n) into Problem 2 and
adopting the continuous relaxation and KKT conditions as
in [3], we can obtain an asymptotically optimal solution of
Problem 1, whose form is analogous to that in Lemma 1 in
[3]. Please refer to [11] for details. The asymptotically optimal
solution can achieve competitive performance at large M .

B. Suboptimal Solution in General Case

In the general case (of arbitrary M ), a low-complexity
algorithm is developed to obtain a suboptimal solution of
Problem 1 using continuous relaxation and DC programming.
First, by replacing the constraints in (1) of Problem 1 with

the following constraints:

µS,l,n

0,

≥

S ∈ I

, l

∈ LS, n

,

∈ N

(12)

the relaxed version of Problem 1 involving only continuous
optimization variables is obtained. Next, by the change of
variables WS,l,n , √ηS,l,nµS,l,nwn, the constraints in (6),

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we compare the proposed solutions with
two baseline schemes. Baseline 1 serves K users separately
(i.e., adopts unicast), and adopts the normalized maximum
ratio transmission (MRT) beamformer for each user on each
subcarrier. Baseline 2 jointly considers the FoVs of all users
(i.e., adopts multicast for a message, if there exists a multicast
opportunity) as in this paper, and adopts the normalized MRT
beamformer for a massage on each subcarrier obtained based
on the channel matrix of all users requiring this message
on each subcarrier [14]. Then, for each baseline scheme, the
optimal subcarrier, power and rate allocation is obtained by
solving Problem 2 for the respective MRT using the method
proposed in [3]. In this simulation, we set βk = 1 for all
15, B = 39

kHz, N = 64, σ2 = 10−9 W, and assume hn,k, n

are randomly and independently distributed according

to
V enice [15]. The 360 VR video encoder named Kvazaar
is adopted. Set L = 5, and choose Dl, l
as in [6].
Given the viewing direction of a user, the associated FoV
Fv can be determined. To avoid delay in view
of size Fh
switching, extra 15◦ in the four directions of the requested
k for each user k
FoV is transmitted, determining

First, we evaluate the average power over 1,000 random
choices for the viewing directions of 1-5 users from 30 users
in [15]. Fig. 2 (a) illustrates the average power versus the
number of users K. We can see that the average powers
of the proposed solutions and baseline schemes increase
with K, as the transmission load increases with K. Given
the unsatisfactory performance of Baseline 1, we no longer
compare with it in the remaining ﬁgures. Fig. 2 (b) illustrates
the average power versus the number of antennas M . We
can see the powers achieved by the proposed solutions and
baseline schemes decrease with M . Besides, by Fig. 2 (b), we
can observe that the proposed asymptotically optimal solution
achieves better performance than Baseline 2 when the number
of antennas is larger than 8. Next, we show the impact of
concentration of the viewing directions of all users. We choose

the viewing directions of 5 users out of 30 users in [15], i.e.,
(νk, γk)k∈{1,...,5}, as shown in Fig. 3. Based on the chosen
viewing directions, we consider ﬁve sets of viewing directions,
i.e., (ν1 + ∆, γ1), (ν2 + ∆, γ2), (ν3, γ3), (ν4 −
∆, γ4), and
∆, γ5), ∆ = 1, . . . , 5, and evaluate the corresponding
(ν5 −
average powers. Note that ∆ reﬂects the concentration of the
viewing directions of the 5 users. In particular, the concentra-
tion increases with ∆. Fig. 4 shows the average power versus
the concentration parameter ∆. It can be observed that the av-
erage power of each multicast scheme decreases with ∆, since
multicast opportunities increase with ∆. Finally, from Fig. 2
and Fig. 4, it can be observed that the proposed solutions
perform better than the baseline schemes. Speciﬁcally, the
proposed solutions outperform Baseline 1, as they achieve a
higher spectral efﬁciency utilizing multicast opportunities. The
proposed solutions outperform Baseline 2, as they carefully
choose beamforming vectors.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we studied optimal transmission of a multi-
quality tiled 360 VR video to multiple users in an MIMO-
OFDMA system. We minimized the total transmission power
by optimizing the beamforming vector and subcarrier, trans-
mission power and rate allocation. This is a challenging mixed
discrete-continuous optimization problem. We obtained an
asymptotically optimal solution in the case of a large antenna
