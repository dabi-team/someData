Abstract. We study the spin-down of a neutron star at-
mosphere during the Type I X-ray burst in low mass X-ray
binaries. Using polar cap acceleration models, we show
that the resulting stellar “wind” torque on the burning
shell due to the ﬂowing charged particles (electrons, pro-
tons and ions) from the star’s polar caps may change the
shell’s angular momentum during the burst. We conclude
that the net change in the angular momentum of the star’s
atmosphere can account for rather large frequency drifts
observed during Type I X-ray burst.

1. Introduction

It is believed that thermonuclear ﬂashes in pure helium or
mixed hydrogen/helium layers on the surface of weakly-
magnetic (B ≤ 1010 G) accreting (at rate 10−11M⊙ yr−1
< ˙M < 10−8M⊙ yr−1) neutron stars cause the observed
Type X-ray bursts in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs)
(Hansen & Van Horn, 1975; Maraschi & Cavaliere, 1977;
Lewin, van Paradijs, & Taam, 1995; Woosley & Taam,
1976; Bildsten, 1998). The accumulated hydrogen and he-
lium on the surface of the neutron star by accretion ig-
nites and burns periodically. General observed features
of Type I X-ray bursts, such as burst ﬂuorescences (∼
1039 erg), burst recurrence times (∼ few hours), and
burst durations (∼ 10 − 100 s); are successfully explained
by spherically symmetric thermonuclear runaway mod-
els (Lewin, van Paradijs, & Taam, 1995; Bildsten, 1998).
Recent observations from ten LMXBs with the Rossi X-
ray Timing Explorer have revealed nearly-coherent oscil-
lations during Type I X-ray bursts with frequencies in the
range ν0 ∼ 270 − 620 Hz (van der Klis, 2000; Strohmayer,
2001). Such highly coherent oscillations are interpreted as
rotational modulation of surface brightness asymmetries:
burning starts locally at some points, creates a brightness

asymmetry, and spreads over the entire stellar surface as
the star rotates. This can be understood by noting that
the timescales for accretion between bursts is much longer
than the burst duration, so the existence of identical con-
ditions over the whole surface of the star for the burning
instability to start simultaneously is very unlikely. There-
fore, these oscillations provide a direct measurement of
the neutron star spin frequency (Strohmayer et al., 1996).
Further, observing such oscillations supports the idea that
the neutron stars in LMXBs are the progenitors of the
millisecond radio pulsars, see Bhattacharya (1995) for a
review.

The discovery of such high coherence, large modula-
tion amplitudes, and stable frequency oscillations while
providing the convincing evidence that the burst oscilla-
tion frequency is related to the neutron star spin frequency
(Strohmayer, 2001), however, has brought many new puz-
zles. An initial puzzle seen in the observations was that the
oscillation frequency increases by ∆ν ∼ a few Hz during
the burst. Strohmayer et al. (1997) ﬁrstly proposed that
this frequency shift is due to the conservation of angular
momentum of the decoupled burning shell from the neu-
tron star in which the shell undergoes spin changes as it
expands and contracts during the Type I X-ray bursts.
Motivated by this proposal, Strohmayer & Markwardt
(1999) and Miller (1999, 2000) modeled the observed fre-
quency evolution and found that the oscillations are co-
herent, as expected if rotation is the cause. But the ﬁrst
theoretical investigations on understanding the problem
was done by Cumming & Bildsten (2000) who studied the
rotational evolution of the neutron star atmosphere dur-
ing a thermonuclear burst by considering one-dimensional
vertical hydrostatic expansion. Since the nuclear burning
time scale (> fraction of a second) is much bigger than
the vertical sound crossing time scale through the burn-
ing layer (∼ microseconds), the outer layers of the neu-
tron star atmosphere are always in hydrostatic balance.
So by assuming conservation of the angular momentum
of the shell, a hot burning layer expands hydrostatically
by ∆R ∼ 20 m (Ayasli & Joss, 1982; Hanawa & Fulimoto,
1984; Bildsten, 1998), and lags behind the neutron star by
∆ν ∼ νs(2∆R/R) ∼ 1Hz(νs/300Hz)(∆R/20m)(10km/R)

where νs is neutron star spin frequency and R the radius.
As the layer cools down and contracts, the rising oscilla-
tions due to a temperature inhomogeneity, drifts upward
as we seen by ∆ν of few Hertz. By assuming that the
burning shell rotates rigidly, they found rough agreement
with the observed values with fractional frequency shifts
∆ν/ν0 ≤ 0.8%.

However, recent observations suggested that purely ra-
dial hydrostatic expansion and angular momentum con-
servation alone cannot account for explaining rather large
frequency drifts (∆ν/ν0 ∼ 1.3%) observed in some bursts
(Galloway et al., 2001; Wijnands et al., 2001). As pointed
out by Galloway et al. (2001), the required expansion
by these frequency drifts is 4-5 times larger than the
one predicted by Cumming & Bildsten (2000), see Table
1. In order to achieve the rather large frequency shift,
Cumming et al. (2001) improved the calculations done by
Cumming & Bildsten (2000) by including the general rel-
ativistic corrections for either slowly or rapidly rotating
star. In agreement with Abramowicz et al. (2001), they
found that the general relativity has small eﬀect on the
angular momentum conservation law (∼ 5 − 10%). Com-
paring with the data, for a rigidly rotating atmosphere,
they obtained that the expected spin-down is a factor of
two or three less than the actual observed values. In an-
other attempt, Spitkovsky et al. (2001) considered a two-
dimensional hydrodynamics model that the burning spots
can spread over the neutron star surface. Due to the com-
bination of the radial expansion of the burning shell and
rotation of the star, they proposed that horizontal hy-
drodynamics ﬂows may arise in the neutron star burning
ocean during the Type I X-ray burst. By taking into ac-
count the action of the Coriolis force due to the rapid
rotation of the star, they showed that the horizontal ﬂows
may explain many features of observed bursts such as the
very short rise time of X-ray bursts and the lack of burst
oscillations in several bursts. Further, they argued that
during cooling the hot ashes left by burning front, there is
temperature gradient between equator and pole, increas-
ing toward the pole, which drives a zonal thermal wind
directed backward to the neutron star rotation. 1 They
found that only if the frequency drift due to the radial
expansion is combined with the geostrophic drift caused
by backward zonal ﬂows, one may expect to observe the
rather large frequency drifts of burst oscillations in tails
of some bursts.

Previous models are based on the angular momen-
tum conservation of the expanding/contracting neutron
star atmosphere during the Type I X-ray burst. Al-
though these models are mostly successful in explaining
the many features of Type I bursts, the rather large fre-

1 Actually they showed that due to the hydrostatic balance
the material will likely ignite sooner at the equator rather than
the pole. As a result, one would expect the burning front cools
down at the equator ﬁrstly.

quency drifts observed in some bursts are still unresolved
(Strohmayer & Bildsten, 2003).

Because of no coherent pulsations seen in persistent
emission from the majority of neutron stars in LMXBs,
it is believed that they are weakly magnetized (B ≤ 109
G). So, in previous studies the eﬀect of magnetic ﬁeld of
the neutron star was ignored in the rotational evolution of
burning atmosphere during the X-ray bursts. In this pa-
per we study the change in the angular momentum of the
burning shell during the Type I X-ray burst. This study
is based on polar cap particle acceleration models in the
pulsar polar cap regions. Due to the star’s rotation and
magnetic ﬁeld an electric ﬁeld must be induced in mag-
netosphere, i.e. E = −(Ωs × r) × B/c, that has non-zero
component along the magnetic ﬁeld lines (E|| = E·B) (see
for recent review Mestel, 1998). Ωs is the angular velocity
of the star, and r is a distance outside of the star. The
parallel electric ﬁeld accelerates charged particles along
the open magnetic ﬁeld lines above the polar caps up to
ultrarelativistic energies toward the star’s light cylinder
(rlcΩ = c). Here, we argue that, for typical magnetic ﬁeld
B ∼ 108 G, the net charged particles ﬂowing from star
surface to inﬁnity in the pulsar polar caps, would exert a
stellar wind torque on the burning shell that may cause
the angular momentum of the shell to change during the
burst. We show that the net change in the angular momen-
tum of the shell during the burst can account for rather
large frequency drifts of burst oscillations.

2. The model

The theory of particle acceleration in pulsar magneto-
sphere has been studied for three decades, after pioneering
work by Goldreich & Julian (1969) on pulsar electrody-
namics. The charged particles accelerated by the parallel
electric ﬁeld (relative to the magnetic ﬁeld lines) escape
from the surface along the open ﬁeld lines which extended
beyond the star’s light cylinder (of radius rlc ∼ 5 × 109/νs
cm, where νs in Hertz), and form a relativistic stellar wind.
Several kind of acceleration mechanisms has been devel-
oped (Mestel, 1998), however, the one proposed by Arons
(1979, 1981) may apply likely to X-ray burst pulsars that
we will consider here. Arons assumed that charged parti-
cles (electrons and ions) ﬂow freely from the neutron star
surface due to the thermal activities. Freely escaping par-
ticles from the neutron star surface depends on the binding
energy (referred as the cohesive energy for ions and as the
work function for electrons) and the surface temperature.
For typical magnetic ﬁeld of a neutron star in LMXBs
(∼ 108 G), the threshold temperature for thermionic emis-
sion of electrons is Te ∼ 104 K and for ions is Ti ∼ 103 K
(Luo, Shibata & Melrose, 2000) that are 104 − 105 lower
that surface temperature of the neutron star in LMXBs.
Further, due to the thermonuclear activities on the surface
of the star during the X-ray burst, the particles’ kinetic en-

ergy would increase signiﬁcantly. Therefore, freely ﬂowing
particles is very likely from the surface of such a pulsar.

Outward ﬂowing charged particles above the pulsar po-
lar caps along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines causes the
Goldreich-Julian (corotation) charge density ρGJ ∼ Ωs ·
B/2πc cannot be kept balanced (Harding & Muslimov,
1998). As a result, a strong electric ﬁeld develops along
the magnetic ﬁeld, E||, above the magnetic poles due
to the departure of total charge density ρe from the
Goldreich-Julian charge density, starts from zero at the
surface and grows with distance above the surface. Even
though ρe = ρGJ, and therefore E|| = 0 at the surface,
the curvature of the ﬁeld lines causes the area of the
open-ﬁeld region to increase, so that ρe increases faster
than ρGJ, and then a charge deﬁcit grows with distance
(Harding & Muslimov, 1998). Calculation of the parallel
electric ﬁeld is so complicated and depends on several
mechanisms that work to enhance or screen the ﬁeld. In a
series of papers Harding & Muslimov (1998, 2001, 2002);
and Harding, Muslimov & Zhang (1998) have extensively
studied the inﬂuence of pair production, inertial frame-
dragging eﬀect, curvature radiation, and inverse Compton
scattering on the E||. They showed that for the unsatu-
rated region with altitude in range 0 < z ≪ (ΩsR/c)1/2 ≃
0.1 (for Ωs = 600π(νs/300 Hz) rad/s and R ∼ 106 cm)
above the stellar surface, the parallel electric ﬁeld grows
linearly with height as E||(θ, φ, z) = E0(θ, φ)z, while for
the saturated region with z > (ΩsR/c)1/2, the parallel
electric ﬁeld that is nearly constant respect to the alti-
tude, drops by three order of magnitudes. Here θ and φ are
spherical polar and azimuthal angles, and z is the altitude
in units of stellar radius. The amplitude E0(θ, φ) depends
on magnetic ﬁeld strength B, spin frequency νs, and ori-
entation of the magnetic ﬁeld symmetric axis relative to
the star spin axis χ. In a simple form, one can estimate
E|| when the charged particles ﬂow freely from the neu-
tron star surface (see Arons, 1981; Usov & Melrose, 1995;
Harding & Muslimov, 2001) as

Note we calculated E|| here for a typical neutron star in
LMXBs with nearly perpendicular ﬁeld orientation rela-
tive to the spin axis. The relative fraction of electric force
to the gravity force above the burning front during the
burst, ie. z ∼ 10−3, for electrons and protons are ∼ 8×104
and ∼ 42, respectively. As a result, electrons, protons, and
even ionized helium atoms can be accelerated easily along
the magnetic ﬁeld lines by parallel electric ﬁeld presented
in the polar caps of neutron stars in LMXBs. Since the
magnetic ﬁeld lines in the polar cap regions are not closed
and extended beyond the star’s light cylinder, the accel-
erated particles in these regions may leave the neutron

star magnetosphere. The resulting ﬂow of particles from
the polar caps to inﬁnity produces a relativistic “stellar
wind”, that exerts a “stellar wind torque” (Michel, 1991)
on the shell, and then causes the net angular momentum of
the shell to change during the burst. The net wind torque
exerted on the shell due to the out ﬂowing charged parti-
cles from the star polar caps is estimated by Michel (1991)
for the Goldreich-Julian charge density to be

TW = I 2/4cΩs

(2)

where I = ηnGJevApc is the total current of the charged
particles ﬂowing from the polar caps with the area Apc ≈
1.6πR3/Rc that is 10% of total star’s area (4πR2). Here

s)1/3 is the corotation dis-
1.6 × 10−19 C, Rc = (GMs/Ω2
tance for a star with mass Ms, and v ≥ 0.1c is average
speed of particles at z ∼ 10−3. The velocity of particle
grows up quickly to ∼ c at z ∼ 0.1 as it is accelerated
by E||. η ≥ 1 is a dimensionless factor (free parameter
of the model) such that the quantity ηnGJ represents the
actual number density of particles that accelerated and
left the star due to the parallel electric ﬁeld. The value of
η ≃ 1 for old and isolated neutron stars (with no observed
bursts), i.e. the space charge density is nearly Goldreich-
Julian charge density for these stars. But in neutron stars
in LMXBs with an ocean of accumulated hot matters,
the value of η must be greater than 1, due to the free
ejection of particles from the front surface of the ocean.
Further, during bursting the accumulated materials with
T ≥ 108 K on the neutron star surface , the kinetic energy
of particles inside the ocean abruptly increases and then,
the space charge density would increase signiﬁcantly in re-
gions with non-zero parallel electric ﬁeld. As a result, one
would expect that the number particles that may leave
the shell would increase during the burst.

It is necessary to note that for neutron stars in LMXBs
with accretion rate, 10−11M⊙ yr−1 < ˙M < 10−8M⊙ yr−1,
the existence of pulsar wind torque might not be consis-
tent with accretion. One would expect the motion of the
accreting material to oppose and shut oﬀ the radio pul-
sar wind, and contribute to the angular momentum of the
system. This scenario is unlikely “during the X-ray burst”
due to the following reasons: huge thermonuclear explo-
sion on the surface of the star causes expolsive eruption
the accumulated materials from the surface during the
burst with a mass bulk velocity close to the speed of light.
As a result, one would expect the action of accretion to
more or less shut oﬀ in this period, e.g by evacuation of
part of the inner accretion disk during radius expansion.
Furthermore, it has been suggested the action of accretion
torque is balanced by the gravitational radiation torque
in neutron stars in LMXBs, see Bildsten (1998a, 2002) for
details. Therefore, the increased angular momentum due
to accretion is lost to gravitational radiation. The latter
mechanism provides a natural explanation for the rota-

tion of stars in a narrow range of frequencies, νs ∼ 300
Hz. Finally, the magnitude of accretion torque Ta ∼

tude smaller than that of the wind torque Tw ∼ 9.32×1033
dyn cm for η ∼ 1000 and B ∼ 108 G, see Eq. (3) and the
discussion below Eq. (9).

Equation (3) gives the exerted torque on the neutron star
surface due to the ﬂowing charged particles from the pul-
sar polar caps. Therefore, the burning shell of the neutron
star will experience this torque as it expands during the
burst. The angular momentum of the shell at a distance
R from the center of the star in Newtonian dynamics can
be written as

2.1. Before the X-ray burst

In this period the star accumulates materials in the
ocean that more or less rigidly corotates with the star
(Cumming et al., 2001). The parallel electric ﬁeld inside
the ocean is nearly neutralized due to redistribution of
charge particles of the ocean. So in this period, the electric
ﬁeld more or less start from zero above the front surface of
the shell and increase by height due to the charge deﬁcit
caused by free emission of charged particles from the front
surface. The space charge density above the front surface
would be bigger than but not to far from the Goldreich-
Julian charge density and increases by time due to the
thermonuclear activities in the oceans. So we expect that
η ∼ 10 − 100.

However, the polar cap acceleration is more or less sup-
pressed due to strongly accreting plasma in this period. As
a result, the pulsar wind torque would be negligible.

Furthermore, because of nearly rigid rotation of the
ocean with star the net wind torque during this period
will be acted more or less on the star itself. Therefore, Eq.
(7) should be corrected for this period as

ℓ = κM R2Ω,

(4)

∆Ω
Ω (cid:19)shell

(cid:18)

= −(Tw/κ′MsR2Ω) ∆t,

where constant κ = (I/M R2)shell depends on the equation
of state and κ ≤ 2/3 (an uniform spherical shell). Here M
and I are the mass and moment inertia of the shell. Equa-
tion (4) may be corrected by ℓ = κM R2 sin2 θΩs/(1 −
2GMs/R)1/2 for a relativistic spherical star and by ℓ =
κM R2 sin2 θ(Ωs − ω)/(1 − 2GMs/R)1/2 for a rotating rel-
ativistic star (see Cumming et al., 2001). Here ω = Js/R3
where Js is the total angular momentum of the star. How-
ever, as shown by Cumming et al. (2001), the relativistic
corrections have small contributions to the ﬁnal results,
and so we ignore them. The time evolution of the angular
momentum of the shell will be

(R2Ω)shell = −Tw/κM,

(5)

∆
∆t

or

(R2Ω)shell(2∆R/R + ∆Ω/Ω)shell = −(Tw/κM )∆t.

(6)

Therefore, the change in the angular velocity of the burn-
ing shell will be

(∆Ω/Ω)shell = −2∆R/R − (Tw/κM R2Ω) ∆t.

(7)

Here we assumed that the change in the mass of the shell
is order of or less than (∆R/R)2 and then we neglect it
(see Cumming et al., 2001). Equation (7) represent the
change in angular velocity of the shell during the burst.
Now we discuss the change in angular velocity in three
stages, before the X-ray burst or the recurrence period,
the rising period, and after the burst.

is clear, the net wind torque on the shell/star in this period
and so the change in angular velocity of the shell/star is
negligible.

2.2. The rising time

This period starts with abruptly thermonuclear ignition
of the accumulated hydrogens and heliums during the re-
currence time. The burning layers expand in less than
∼ 1 second up to z ≃ 2 × 10−3 (Ayasli & Joss, 1982;
Hanawa & Fulimoto, 1984; Bildsten, 1998). In this period,
as in the hydrostatic models, we assume that the rota-
tional evolution of the expanding shell is nearly indepen-
dent of the star itself.

As we mentioned before, in this period due to the huge
thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the star, the
accumulated materials are explosively erupted out of the
star with a mass bulk velocity close to the speed of light.
The outgoing plasma density within period of time ∆t ∼ 1
second, is ∼ [(Apc/4πR2)Mshell]/Apc that is 10 times (or
more) larger than in-falling plasma density macc/Apc due
to the accretion ﬂow at the same period of time. Here
macc = ˙M ∆t is the average mass of accreting materials
during ∆t. As a result, one would expect the action of
accretion to more or less shut oﬀ during this period.

Vahid Rezania: Large frequency drifts during Type I X-ray bursts

The parallel electric force at height z ≃ 2 × 10−3 is 80
times bigger than gravitational force for hydrogen atoms,
see Eq. (1). Therefore, the charged particles that rise with
the expanding layers will be accelerated toward the out-
side of light cylinder by the strong parallel electric ﬁeld
along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines. Further, the sudden
thermonuclear explosion of the accumulated materials in
the ocean causes the thermal energy of the charged par-
ticles to increase. Consequently, we expect that the num-
ber density of particles that may leave the magnetosphere
ηnGJ in this period increases signiﬁcantly. The resulting
wind torque for η ∼ 103 will give a net change in angular
velocity of the shell as

where κ = 2/3 and ∆R ≃ 10 m is the average change

η ∼ 103 and B ∼ 108 G, the net change in angular
velocity of the shell given by Eq. (9) is in good agree-
ment with large frequency shifts seen in observations. We
note that for η ∼ 103, the number of particles that left
the star ∆N ∼ 4πηnGJR2∆R is much smaller than to-
tal number of particles in the ocean N ∼ M/mp, i.e.
∆N/N ≃ 4 × 10−7. As expected, the change in mass of
the shell is order of (∆R/R)2 ∼ 10−6. In Table 1 we cal-
culate the quantity ηB for both 300 Hz and 600 Hz spin
frequencies (for those which applicable), to produce the
frequency shifts observed in various systems. As a result,
the suggested magnetic ﬁelds are in range 1 − 10 × 107 G
for η ∼ 100 − 1000. This is consistent with other observa-
tional evidences about the magnetic ﬁeld of neutron stars
in LMXBs.

2.3. After the X-ray burst

At ﬁnal stage, after the thermonuclear ﬂash, the expansion
will be stopped by the star’s gravity force, and then the
expanded layers start to contract as they cool down. Be-
cause of the charge redistributions during the expansion,
the original induced electric ﬁeld is neutralized inside the
expanded shell. So the magnitude of the parallel electric
ﬁeld inside the ocean will drop to zero, and then the elec-
trostatic acceleration will cease inside the ocean. Due to
the lack of outward electrostatic acceleration, the ocean’s
particles are mostly accelerated downward by strong grav-
ity. Furthermore, the action of accretion plasma is start-
ing to recover, and as a result, the polar cap acceleration
will shut down in this period. Although, because of new

charge distribution, a new parallel electric ﬁeld may de-
velop above the burned front we expect that the polar
cap particle acceleration mechanism is more or less un-
likely after the burst. As a result, the number of particles
that may leave the star will decrease as well, i.e. η ≤ 10.
Further as the shell cools down, it gets closer and closer
to the star, and then its coupling to the star gets stronger
and stronger. This can be understood by noting the mag-
netic ﬁeld near the star’s surface opposes the diﬀerential
rotation arising between shell’s layers and surface of the
star during the burst. Therefore, the net wind torque will
be acting more and more on the whole star again rather
than shell itself, and so we neglect it, see Sect. 2.1.

The magnetic recoupling of the shell forces the shell
to spin up until it achieves the star’s spin frequency. The
shell gains its angular momentum deﬁcit (M R2∆Ω)shell,
from the star, and then it reduces the angular velocity
of the star by δΩs = (M/Ms)∆Ω ≃ 10−12∆Ω which is
negligible. As a result, one would expect that the oscil-
lations’ frequency will increase as the shell spins up by
∆ν/ν0 ∼ ∆Ω/Ω. In Fig. 1, we compare the corresponding
changes suggested by previous studies (Strohmayer et al.,
1997; Cumming et al., 2001) and the one we discussed
here. As is clear, due to the exerted torque by the particle
wind in the polar cap regions, the shell’s spin frequency,
and then the oscillations’ frequency decrease more than in
the calculation by Cumming et al. (2001) during the ris-
ing time. Therefore, we expect to observe larger change in
oscillations’ frequency during the burst tail.

3. Discussion

Among the ∼ 50 known Galactic LMXBs, the highly co-
herent burst oscillations with large modulation amplitudes
and stable frequencies in range ν0 ∼ 270 − 620 Hz are seen
in ten LMXBs during Type I X-ray bursts. These oscilla-
tions are most commonly seen during tails of bursts, when
the burning is thought to have spread over the whole sur-
face and obviously asymmetry is no longer present, are
not observed in all Type I X-ray bursts from the same
source. While it is believed that the oscillation frequency
is closely related to the neutron star spin frequency due
to the observation of the kHz quasi-periodic oscillations in
the persistent emission (van der Klis, 2000), there is still
an ambiguity that whether the oscillation frequency is the
spin frequency or twice the spin frequency. Further, as seen
in observations, the oscillation frequency increases by ∆ν
a few Hz during the burst. This frequency shift is ﬁrstly ex-
plained by Strohmayer et al. (1997) that the burning shell
decouples from the star, and undergoes spin changes due
to the conservation of angular momentum of the shell as
it expands and contracts during the Type I X-ray bursts.
Further observations and studies suggested that purely ra-
dial hydrostatic expansion and angular momentum conser-
vation alone cannot explain rather large frequency drifts
(∆ν/ν ∼ 1.3%) observed in some bursts (Cumming et al.,

6

Vahid Rezania: Large frequency drifts during Type I X-ray bursts

2001; Galloway et al., 2001; Wijnands et al., 2001). For re-
cent review on the thermonuclear bursts and their prop-
erties see Strohmayer & Bildsten (2003).

In this paper, we addressed the latter problem by
studying the evolution of angular momentum of the burn-
ing shell during the Type I X-ray bursts in LMXBs. Based
on particle acceleration models near a pulsar polar cap re-
gion (Mestel, 1998), we studied the change in the angular
momentum of the burning shell during the Type I X-ray
burst. The net charged particles that accelerated by par-
allel electric ﬁeld in star’s polar caps, ﬂow from the star
surface to inﬁnity through open magnetic ﬁeld lines, would
exert a torque on the burning shell (called wind torque)
and cause the angular momentum of the shell changes dur-
ing the burst. We introduced a dimensionless factor η that
the quantity ηnGJ represent the number density of the
ejected particles from the burning layers above the pulsar
polar caps. We showed that for η ∼ 100 − 1000 (during
X-ray bursts) and a typical magnetic ﬁeld B ∼ 1−10×107
G in the pulsar polar caps, the rather large observed fre-
quency drifts of burst oscillations can be explained by the
resulting wind torque exerted on the burning shell. In Ta-
ble 1, we obtained the values for ηB for both 300 Hz and
600 Hz spin frequencies that causes the corresponding fre-
quency drift observed in each burst. As is clear, the result-
ing magnetic ﬁelds’ strength is in a good agreement with
other observations from the neutron stars in LMXBs, such
as the lack of coherence pulsations in persistent emission.
Above the neutron star’s polar caps particles ﬂow out-
ward along the open magnetic ﬁeld lines and a steady
charge density cannot be maintained at the Goldreich-
Julian density everywhere. Consequently, a strong elec-
tric ﬁeld develops along the magnetic ﬁeld, extracts the
‘primary’ charged particles with density n ∼ nGJ (for
a star with no burst activity, see Sect. 2) from the sur-
face and accelerate them to high Lorentz factor (∼ 107).
According to the polar cap models, the predicted radi-
ation luminosity for a typical millisecond pulsar would
be E ∼ 1033(νs/300 Hz)5/28(B/108 G)−1/7 ergs/s that
is comparable to γ-ray luminosities. So, one may expect
to observe γ-rays in millisecond pulsars that has been de-
tected only in PSR J0218+4232 by EGRET (Kui et. al.,
2000). However, polar cap particle acceleration is limited
by various energy loss mechanisms such as curvature radi-
ation, resonant and nonresonant inverse Compton scatter-
ing, and pair production. The accelerated particles along
the magnetic ﬁeld lines suﬀer energy loss and emit photons
through the curvature radiation. Further, these particles
scattered by soft thermal X-ray photons emitted from the
hot surface and loss energy via inverse Compton scatter-
ing. In addition, the high energy photons resulted from
the curvature radiation and/or inverse Compton scatter-
ing produce a cascade of ‘secondary’ e± pair particles
with a number density ne± ∼ 105n above polar cap re-
gion that change the charge distributions and screen the
electric ﬁeld (see for more detail Harding & Muslimov,

2001). In millisecond pulsars (with no burst activities)
the polar cap particle acceleration mechanism was stud-
ied by Luo, Shibata & Melrose (2000). They showed that
in these pulsars this mechanism, which is relatively eﬃ-
cient in accelerating charged particles in the star’s polar
caps, mostly suﬀers energy loss from the radiation of ac-
celerated particles along the ﬁeld lines ( curvature radi-
ation). So the maximum energy attainable by the parti-
cle is limited by energy loss through the radiation reac-
tion. They found that the maximum Lorentz factor that
might be achieved by an individual particle at z ∼ 0.1
c/e)1/4 ∼ 107, however, the Lorentz fac-
is Γ = (6πε0E||ρ2
tor for the bulk pair plasma is much smaller ∼ 100. The
latter may explain the lack of detection of high energy γ-
rays in these stars. Here E|| is given by Eq. (1) and ρc ∼
(4/3)(cR/2πνs)1/2 ∼ 5 × 104(300 Hz/νs)1/2(R/106 cm) m
is the curvature radius of the ﬁeld lines.

For neutron stars in LMXBs with intermediate accre-
tion rate 10−11M⊙ yr−1 < ˙M < 10−8M⊙ yr−1, how-
ever, the polar cap acceleration mechanism mostly suf-
fers from the action of accretion plasma. Because of the
large plasma density (macc/Apc) of the accretion ﬂow to-
ward star’s polar caps, the parallel electric ﬁeld in the po-
lar cap regions would be shorted out and the polar cap
acceleration mechanism would be suppressed. We note
that, this scenario is not likely during X-ray bursts due
to the explosively erupting materials from the surface
and possible evacuation of part of inner disk. In this pe-
riod with ∆t ∼ 1 second, the eruptive plasma density
is 10 times larger that the accreting plasma density, ie.
∼ [(Apc/4πR2)Mshell]/Apc ∼ 10 macc/Apc.

– Table 1: In this table we obtain the lowest radius expan-
sion ∆R (based on hydrostatic expansion models) and the
scaled magnetic ﬁeld ηB (based on the polar cap parti-
cle acceleration models) for some X-ray bursts in LMXBs.
We calculate these quantities for two chosen values of the
star spin frequency, νs = 300 Hz and νs = 600 Hz, such
that the corresponding frequency shift is comparable with
observations. ν0 is the oscillation frequency and ∆ν its cor-
responding shift seen during the burst. The value of ηB is
based on the assumed value of ∆R ≃ 20 m for both spin
frequencies, see Eq. (9).

In this ﬁgure we schematically compare the change in angular velocity of the expanding shell and then
oscillations’ frequency during the type I X-ray burst suggsted by Cumming et al. (2001) (dotted line) and the one
proposed here (solid line). Due to the exerted torque on the shell by the particle wind from the magnetic polar cap
regions during the burst, we expect a larger depth in ∆Ω rather than the model discussed by Cumming et al. (2001).
As a result, the larger drift would be expected in the burst tail. The solid and dotted curve after the burst are drawn
schematically to show star-shell recoupling in this period.
