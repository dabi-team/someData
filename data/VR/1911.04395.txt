ABSTRACT
TouchVR is a novel wearable haptic interface which can deliver
multimodal tactile stimuli on the palm by DeltaTouch haptic dis-
play and vibrotactile feedback on the fingertips by vibration motors
for the Virtual Reality (VR) user. DeltaTouch display is capable of
generating 3D force vector at the contact point and presenting mul-
timodal tactile sensation of weight, slippage, encounter, softness,
and texture. The VR system consists of HTC Vive Pro base stations
and head-mounted display (HMD), and Leap Motion controller for
tracking the user’s hands motion in VR. The MatrixTouch, BallFeel,
and RoboX applications have been developed to demonstrate the
capabilities of the proposed technology. A novel haptic interface
can potentially bring a new level of immersion of the user in VR
and make it more interactive and tangible.

1 INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, many different entertainment applications, games, and
simulators that implemented with VR/AR technologies are available
in the market. However, the most VR/AR applications have a lack of
providing feasible feedback to the user. In order to sense the physical
interaction with the virtual environment, it is needed to reproduce
tactile senses, which are a crucial component to accomplish the
full immersion. Achieving a real touch simulation is a rather hard
task which includes a representation of parameters of an object
such as shape, hardness, weight, texture, and temperature. Some
wearable interfaces for simulating the grasping of rigid objects in a
virtual environment have been proposed, such as Wolverine [Choi
et al. 2016], and Grabity [Choi et al. 2017]. They can provide the
sensation of contact, gripping, gravity, and inertia. A number of
haptic interfaces provide both kinesthetic and cutaneous stimuli to
the hand [Son and Park 2018], [Hinchet et al. 2018].

We propose a novel wearable haptic interface for providing cu-
taneous feedback both at the fingertips and on a palm in VR envi-
ronment (Fig. 1 (a)).

2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
A wearable haptic interface provides cutaneous feedback on the
palm by DeltaTouch haptic display [Trinitatova and Tsetserukou
2019] and vibrotactile feedback on the fingertips by vibration mo-
tors (tablet type, 8x3 mm). DeltaTouch is a wearable haptic display
to provide multimodal tactile stimuli at the palm of the user based
on the parallel inverted delta structure attached at the hand of
the user (Fig. 1 (b)). The DeltaTouch device provides a sense of
touch at one point in the palm of the user. The unique feature is
that display can generate 3D force vector at the contact point to
simulate the direction of applied force and sliding direction with
arbitrary pressure. The inverted Delta mechanism is proposed to
achieve compact and lightweight structure. The vibration at the
contact point is achieved by a vibration motor mounted in the end
effector and can be used with vibration motors on the fingertips
for simulation of the texture of the object. The display is worn on
the user’s hand in such a way that the bottom platform is fixed on
the palm via elastic tapes, while the end effector can freely move
along the palm within the boundary of the base platform. And the
vibrations motors are fastened to the fingertips via elastic tapes
with velcro. The VR setup includes HTC Vive Pro base stations and
head-mounted display (HMD), and Leap Motion controller attached
to the headset for tracking the user’s hands motion in VR.

3 VR APPLICATIONS
We created several VR applications with different scenarios of user-
objects interaction to demonstrate the various types of provided
tactile feedback. The applications were implemented with the Unity
game engine. During the demonstration user will wear TouchVR
haptic interface in both hands and HTC Vive HMD. The first appli-
cation is designed to demonstrate interactions with different objects
in the VR room. The user can feel the motion of a spider in any
direction and its weight on the palm or pulse beat and shake of the
dragon egg reproduced by the haptic stimuli on the palm of the
user by DeltaTouch display and vibration motors (Fig. 2).

b) Interaction with the shaking egg.

The application BallFeel is designed to demonstrate the sensation
of bouncing the ball in the hands of the user to get the immersive

experience of VR games (Fig. 3). In the MatrixTouch application,
the user can immerse into the digital matrix, representing a 3D
array of running lines (Fig. 1 (c)). The RoboX application allows the
player to operate the object at a distance via gestures of the hand
with the help of tactile feedback. During the collision of the robot
with obstacles, the player feels the vibrotactile feedback (Fig. 1 (d)).

4 CONCLUSIONS
We have proposed a Virtual Reality system augmented by a novel
haptic interface with multimodal tactile feedback. A wearable haptic
display can present 3D force vector at the user palm and multimodal
stimuli (contact, pressure, slippage, texture) at the user’s palm,
while vibration motors provide the vibrotactile feedback to the
fingers. The future work will be aimed at expanding the multimodal
feedback. The additional modality will be provided by attaching a
Peltier element at the tip of the haptic display. Thus, the user will
be capable of experiencing continuous thermal feedback along the
palm skin during motion of DeltaTouch. The haptic interface can be
applied in medical and rehabilitation systems, teleoperation, and VR
simulators (e.g., NurseSim [Nakagawa et al. 2014]). The developed
wearable cutaneous interface can potentially significantly improve
the immersion into VR experience.
