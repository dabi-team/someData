We study the dependence of the vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) on frequency disorder, vibrations,
near-ﬁeld eﬀects and density in molecular polaritonics. In the mesoscopic limit, static frequency
disorder alone can already introduce a loss mechanism from polaritonic states into a dark state
reservoir, which we quantitatively describe, providing an analytical scaling of the VRS with the level
of disorder. Disorder additionally can split a molecular ensemble into donor-type and acceptor-type
molecules and the combination of vibronic coupling, dipole-dipole interactions and vibrational
relaxation induces an incoherent FRET (F¨orster resonance energy transfer) migration of excitations
within the collective molecular state. This is equivalent to a dissipative disorder and has the eﬀect of
saturating and even reducing the VRS in the mesoscopic, high-density limit. Overall, this analysis
allows to quantify the crucial role played by dark states in cavity quantum electrodynamics with
mesoscopic, disordered ensembles.

INTRODUCTION

The strength of light-matter coherent exchanges is en-
hanced when conﬁned light modes, such as provided by op-
tical cavities, are utilized. For N ideal two-level quantum
emitters, equally coupled to a cavity mode, a collective
enhancement proportional to N 1/2 can be obtained [1].
This is evident in the scaling of the collective vacuum
Rabi splitting (VRS) in cavity quantum electrodynamics
(cQED) [2–4]. In the particular case where more com-
plex emitters, such as organic molecules (J-Aggregates,
dye molecules, etc.), are collectively coupled to optical
or plasmonic resonators, these standard results of cQED
have been extensively invoked to describe the collective
Rayleigh scattering loss from a cavity [5], the modiﬁ-
cation of energy transfer and transport [6–11], charge
transport [12–15] or chemical reactions in the presence of
strong light-matter interactions [16–19]. However, molec-
ular polaritonics is characterized by emitters with large
inhomogenous broadening, coupled to local vibrational
baths and with strong near-ﬁeld interactions, in which case
analytical approaches are typically limited to only a few
molecules and often with only one vibrational mode [20–
23]. The numerical complexity of treating many electronic
and vibrational degrees of freedom renders such problems
hard to solve even with extensive simulations [24–26].

We propose here a fully analytical approach which
allows to quantify the eﬀect of disorder on light-matter
interactions in the strong coupling regime. In a ﬁrst step,
we introduce the formalism for the case of pure two-level
systems (involving electronic transitions only) with gen-
eral applicability to cQED with atoms, quantum dots,
superconducting qubits, etc. [27–29]. In a second step,
we exemplify the application of this formalism to more
complex systems involving electron-phonon interactions
and in particular to molecular polaritonics [18].

The two main conceptual ingredients of our approach
consist in the move to a collective basis for N emitters and

the occurrence of a natural averaging in the mesoscopic
limit (as opposed to averaging over many realizations [30–
33]). As widely acknowledged, polaritons are formed by
one bright superposition state hybridized with light while
the rest of N − 1 dark states are only indirectly coupled
owing to disorder [20, 34–38]. We take an open system
dynamics approach to derive an analytical rate for the
irreversible loss of energy from polaritonic states into the
dark state manifold accompanied by a degradation of the
VRS. In the bare basis, we elucidate the reduction of the
VRS by showing that particles which are too far detuned
or too lossy can fall out of the macroscopic polaritonic
superposition.

We then apply our formalism to molecular polaritonics
where the interplay between static disorder, near-ﬁeld
couplings and vibrational relaxation leads to a FRET
process characterized by incoherent transfer of excitations
from energetically higher donor-type to lower frequency,

 
 
 
 
 
 
acceptor-type molecules (see Fig. 1). We map this problem
into an incoherent dynamics in Lindblad form describing
migration of excitation at rates analytically computable
and derive the scaling law for the VRS with density ap-
plying the open system dynamics previously derived for
pure two-level systems.

The paper is structured as follows: we introduce the
Tavis-Holstein-Cummings model for N molecules each
with two electronic and n vibronic degrees of freedom
coupled to a conﬁned cavity mode in Sec. II. We then
proceed by analyzing the cavity transmission in the pres-
ence of frequency disorder in Sec. III and show how a
mesoscopic average leads to a decay of polaritons into
the dark state manifold. To characterize the degree of
participation of quantum emitters to the collective strong
coupling condition, we introduce a measure of macro-
scopicity of quantum superpositions reaching value N for
perfect superpositions and unity for complete mixtures.
The eﬀects of dipole-dipole couplings together with vibra-
tional relaxation are taken into account in Sec. IV and
the elimination of the dark state reservoir is revisited,
this time including the process of incoherent excitation
migration within the molecular ensemble. Finally, we
conclude and present an outlook in Sec. V.

We consider N molecules indexed by j = 1, ...N

The vibronic coupling is obtained as a harmonic approx-
imation of a Morse potential surface by expanding the
electronic potential landscapes around their minima: the
diﬀerence between the minima in the ground and excited
state leads then to the Huang-Rhys factors λ2
k. Such a
model is widely employed [20, 21, 40, 41] especially for
molecules in condensed matter environments, as fast vi-
brational relaxation insures that states with more than
one vibrational excitation are never reached.

The cavity mode is described by bosonic operator a at

current experiments operate on the brink of the ultra-
strong coupling regime [42–44], polariton dynamics is well
reproduced within this approximation.

We then proceed by writing the master equation of the

system

∂tρ = i[ρ, H] + L[ρ],

where the dissipative dynamics is included in the Lindblad
part. For a collapse operator O with rate γO the Lindblad
term applied to a density operator ρ is

All channels of dissipation are then modeled as standard
Lindblad superoperators with collapse operators a, σj, bjk
and loss rates κ, γ, Γk.

III. EFFECTS OF DISORDER

We will ﬁrst show the eﬀect of frequency disorder as the
occurrence of dark state resonances in the (linear) spectral
response of the cavity when driven with an external (weak)
laser source. The pump is modelled via the following
Hamiltonian

Hd-d = (cid:80)

Hd = iη(a†e−iω(cid:96)t − aeiω(cid:96)t),

(7)

where the pump frequency is ω(cid:96) and the weak drive am-
plitude is η. The equations of motion for the averages
α = (cid:104)a(cid:105) and βj = (cid:104)σj(cid:105) then read

˙βj = −i(ω − ω(cid:96) + δj − iγ)βj − igjα,
˙α = −i(ωc − ω(cid:96) − iκ)α − i(cid:80)

In a more compact form we can write

˙v = −iM v + vd,

where the vector of amplitudes is v = (β1, . . . , βN , α)(cid:62),
driving is included also in vector form as vd =
(0, . . . , 0, η)(cid:62) and the drift matrix is explicitly given in
Appendix A.

A. Steady state cavity transmission

In steady state, the equations above lead to the normal-
ized cavity amplitude transmission t = κ (cid:104)a(cid:105) /η expressed

order is a trivial renormalization of the collective coupling

from g
tion of the molecular dipoles, as discussed in Appendix
D).

In the following we restrict the discussion to the case
of identical couplings gj = g (for all j). For a given real-
ization of disorder, Fig. 2a shows two polaritonic peaks
N obtained by the hybridization of a symmet-
at ±g
ric collective state to the cavity ﬁeld. Non-zero disorder
introduces couplings to N − 1 orthogonal asymmetric
states visible in the cavity transmission as unequal height
peaks between the polaritons. In the mesoscopic limit
(see Fig. 2b), a natural averaging occurs which leads to a
smoothing out of the additional peaks. Also, the polari-
ton’s height is decreased while their width is increased
suggesting a loss mechanism which we will quantitatively
address in the following in a transformed bright-dark
basis.

For k = N , the equations above indicate that the bright
state is the only one coupled to the cavity mode with the
expected collective rate gN . However, disorder induces
couplings to the whole manifold of dark states and within
the dark manifold as well.

We can more compactly write the equations above as
∂tV = −iMcollV where V = (D1, . . . , DN −1, B, α)(cid:62) and
the drift matrix is

C. Elimination of the dark reservoir

The procedure we will employ roughly follows the il-
lustration in Fig. 2c showing ﬁrst the identiﬁcation of a
bright state and then the elimination of the dark reservoir
resulting in an eﬀective unidirectional loss of energy from
the polaritonic states. The elimination of the dark state
manifold can be done in an exact way without making a
Markovian approximation, which would imply that the
dark state reservoir has no memory and therefore it would
allow to set all derivatives of Dk to zero. Instead, we for-
mally integrate the equations for Dk to obtain (Appendix
C)

and obtain a memory kernel describing a generally non-
Markovian loss process. In the mesoscopic limit, one ﬁnds
f (t − t(cid:48)) ≈ Θ(t − t(cid:48))w2e−i(¯δ−iγ)(t−t(cid:48)) sinc(2w(t − t(cid:48))). Now
one can identify a Markovian limit as a particular case
of wide frequency distributions w (cid:29) γ. The Markovian
result is then simply reproduced by seeing that the kernel
f (t−t(cid:48)) naturally tends to a delta function. In such a case
the treatment can be simpliﬁed by setting all derivatives

to zero in Eqs. (12) to ﬁnd the dark state amplitudes

pative dynamics

˙B = −i (cid:2)(¯δ − δdark) − i(γ + γdark)(cid:3) B − igN α,

(20)

where the eﬀect of the reservoir is to induce an eﬀective
frequency shift δdark and loss rate γdark obtained as the
real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the following
expression

The analytical results are in excellent agreement with
numerical simulations (see Fig. 2d) which also indicate
that both ¯δ and δdark vanish. From here we can deduce
the dependence of the VRS on disorder which can be
obtained by diagonalizing the dynamics in the reduced

This is an important result later generalized to molecules
to analytically quantify the eﬀect of time-dependent
disorder associated with continuous shifting of electronic
resonances via vibronic driving. The VRS is illustrated
in Fig. 2e as a function of increasing disorder. The initial
increase of the polariton splitting occurs in the case
κ > γ as the maximum value of 2gN is reached when
γ + γdark = κ. The complete degradation of the strong
coupling condition occurs when the disorder level is of
the order of the cavity photon loss. The validity of the
Markovian approximation is graphically illustrated in
Fig. 2f.
In Appendix C, we perform a more in-depth
analysis of the non-Markovian regime by means of the
quantum Langevin equations approach.

N − 1 for δ (cid:29) κ (see Fig. 2g). For
large w, this behavior indicates that, when disorder is
strong more particles are likely to have frequencies very
far from the cavity resonance, which ﬁnally leads to the
degradation of the strong coupling condition as clearly
illustrated in Fig. 2e.

E. Macroscopicity of mesoscopic quantum
superposition states

As the VRS can be derived from a Hamiltonian for-
mulation restricted to the single excitation subspace it
is interesting to also investigate the connection between
VRS, as observed for example in the cavity transmission
and the properties of the quantum superposition state.
To this end, we propose a simple measure of quantum
macroscopicity

Let us now provide further clariﬁcations of the mecha-
nism of VRS degradation owed to inhomogeneous broad-
ening by reverting our analysis to the alternative bare

j ∈ {1, . . . , N }. The cavity mode excitation is repre-

Notice that the measure is tuned such that it equals

the time dynamics of the introduced measure of macro-
scopicity in three distinct cases for three diﬀerent initial
states. We distinguish between an initial state with max-
imal macroscopicity (the W-state) and two states with
single particle participation (mixed state versus single
excitation state). The important result illustrated in
Fig. 3b shows that by coherently driving the cavity mode
one can create maximal macroscopicity independently on
the initial state. Also, in the presence of disorder, the
macroscopicity is diminished for all initial states by the
same amount. According to the interpretation obtained
in the VRS case, one can see that for this given real-
ization of disorder two far-detuned particles fall out of
the macroscopic superposition thus diminishing C by 2
[Fig. 3c]. In conclusion, we ﬁnd that cavity driving can
create macroscopicity while disorder and strong donor
behavior can destroy it. It will therefore be interesting
to extend such a measure beyond the single excitation
subspace and to pursue in the future an analysis of the
connection between collective strong coupling and the
macroscopicity of quantum superposition states.

important role. We will provide here a semi-analytical
approach incorporating the competition between static
disorder, vibronic and dipole-dipole couplings together
with vibrational relaxation which can lead to a migration
of excitation from a higher energy molecule (donor) to a
lower energy one (acceptor) (as illustrated in Fig. 1b).
As such ensembles are typically subject to strong
inhomogeneous broadening, an automatic separation
into donor-like and acceptor like molecules will then
take place. To quantify the emergent incoherent FRET
migration behavior we provide a phenomenological model
which allows analytical and numerical insight into the
scaling of the VRS of molecular ensembles with density.

A. FRET migration of excitation

For two near-ﬁeld coupled adjacent molecules j and
j(cid:48), each with a single vibrational mode bj and bj(cid:48) we
perform a polaron transformation which leads to the fol-
lowing transformed operators ˜σj = Q†
jσj and ˜σj(cid:48) = Q†
j(cid:48)σj(cid:48)

Under the assumption of low population of the excited
electronic levels, the dipole-dipole interaction couples the
quantum Langevin dynamics of the two molecules

IV. REDUCTION OF THE VRS IN
MOLECULAR POLARITONICS

Light-matter interactions in molecular ensembles are
strongly modiﬁed in the presence of electron-vibron
coupling as well as by the incoherent dynamics of molec-
ular vibrations. In addition, in standard experimental
situations densities are very high meaning that near
ﬁeld eﬀects such as dipole-dipole couplings can play an

This coupled dynamics can be solved in perturba-
tion theory, assuming that Ωjj(cid:48)
is small compared to
the vibrational relaxation rates. The solution indicates
an eﬀective, largely unidirectional, energy transfer at
rate κjj(cid:48)
ET from molecule j to molecule j(cid:48). The rate is
computed by assuming multiple paths of energy trans-
fer between the two molecules involving all vibrational
modes. We assume an initially electronically excited state
with no vibrations present |ej; 01, 02...0n(cid:105) of molecule j
and ground state without vibrations |gj(cid:48); 01, 02...0n(cid:105) for
molecule j(cid:48). The emission of molecule j leads it into state

summing over all the paths of incoherent migration mod-

within the ensemble, the FRET migration leads to an
eﬀective disorder in dissipation rates. This is directly in-
corporated in Eqs. (8) by amending the diagonal elements
of the evolution matrix

B. VRS scaling at high densities

The expression of the energy transfer rate in Eq. (32)
greatly simpliﬁes numerical simulations as it allows one
to introduce an eﬀective model of loss where for each
pair of molecules j and j(cid:48) a collapse operator σjσ†

Results are then possible for large systems (where a direct
simulation of the evolution of the master equation is
untractable) by a simple diagonalization of this matrix.
The obtained scaling presented in Fig. 4c shows that the
FRET mechanism can lead to a strong deviation from
the standard one ubiquitous in cavity QED with

Beyond numerical estimates, a fully analytical approach
based on the formalism introduced in the previous section

An averaging over disorder and position is possible
assuming homogeneous media showing a scaling of ¯κET
with N 2. This allows for a ﬁt of the result in Fig. 4c
showing that saturation stems from the strong increase
of ¯κET with density squared.

C. Reduction of VRS owing to strong donors

A very simple analysis in terms of bright and dark
states can then shed insight into this scaling by assuming
the eﬀect of large decay onto the VRS. Assuming N − 1
molecules with identical decay rates γ and a single lossier
molecule with γ(cid:48) similar conclusions as in section III
referring to disorder are obtained. We can again cast the
equations as

˙β1 = −γ(cid:48)β1 − igα,
˙BN −1 = −γBN −1 − ig

the polariton frequencies decrease to ±g
illustrated in Fig. 4d). For the many strong donors case
we illustrate in Fig. 4e the gradual degradation of the
VRS in time, from g
N to zero, when successively parti-
cles are turned from weak to strong donors. Following
this interpretation, we added histograms in the inset

√

√

We proposed here an analytical approach which al-
lows to quantify the eﬀect of disorder on light-matter
interactions in the strong coupling regime and which is
extendable to molecular ensembles characterized by vi-
bronic eﬀects as well as near ﬁeld eﬀects owing to the
electromagnetic vacuum. Employing a phenomenological
model that incorporates all these aspects in an eﬀective
incoherent FRET migration of energy, scalings of the VRS
with increasing density have been obtained, showing a
strong divergence from the standard
N scaling in the
absence of particle-particle interactions.

√

The models used throughout the paper, albeit of lim-
ited validity, are standard and widely employed. For
example, while the Holstein model for electron-vibron
coupling is limited to molecules with large vibrational
relaxation (such that anharmonicity is not reached) it pro-
vides a proper description to light-molecule [21, 23, 46]
and molecule-molecule interactions [23, 47]. The Tavis-
Cummings model has also been universally used to predict
and explain eﬀects such as cavity mediated energy trans-
fer [8–10, 23], energy and charge transport [6, 7, 12–15],
cavity chemistry [16–19] etc. However, as some exper-
iments are showing eﬀects brought on by the onset of
the ultrastrong coupling regime (such as for example
the work function of a material [48]), recent theoreti-
cal works suggest that such regime is challenging and
interesting [49, 50] and approaches are greatly interdisci-
plinary mixing aspects of quantum optics with quantum
chemistry methods [51]. In the future, we will extend
our formalism based on linear quantum Langevin equa-
tions to include counter-rotating terms in the light-matter
interaction Hamiltonian.

since (cid:80)N −1

shift becomes δdark → 0 for large N and γdark = w2/γ.
A rough approximation can be performed in the case ˜λj (cid:29) γ for most j ∈ {1, . . . , N − 1}. Here we set again

reality the sorted eigenvalue distribution follows ˜λj =
2πw erf −1(2j/N − 1) for j ∈ {1, . . . , N − 1} when N → ∞,
which is the quantile function of the Gaussian distribution for the energy disorder. The best approximation is given
for q = 2 resulting in γdark = (π/4)w as shown in Fig. 5b while δdark = 0.

Here we want to derive a ﬁrst-order FRET rate between two near-ﬁeld coupled molecules j and j(cid:48), each with a single

For simplicity, for the numerical simulations, we will assume parallel orientation of all dipoles. The dipole-dipole
interaction then expresses as Ωjj(cid:48) = 3
2 γ/(k|rj − rj(cid:48)|)3 with wavenumber k = 2π/λ0 (λ0 is the wavelength of the
electronic transition) [52]. We will consider initial excitation of molecule j and assume molecule j(cid:48) to be in the
electronic ground state initially. The equation of motion for the acceptor’s population reads:
