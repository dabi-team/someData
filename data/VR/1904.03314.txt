ABSTRACT
The on-going vertical phase mixing, manifesting itself as a snail shell in the Z − VZ phase space, has been
discovered with the Gaia DR2 data. To better understand the origin and properties of the phase mixing process,
we study the vertical phase-mixing signatures in arches (including the classical “moving groups”) of the VR −Vφ
phase space near the Solar circle.
Interestingly, the phase space snail shell exists only in the arches with
Vφ − VLSR
. 30 km/s, i.e., stars on dynamically “colder” orbits. The snail shell becomes much weaker and
|
eventually disappears for increasingly larger radial action (JR), quantifying the “hotness” of orbits. Thus one
should pay closer attention to the colder orbits in future phase mixing studies. We also conﬁrm that the Hercules
stream has two branches (at fast and slow Vφ), which may not be explained by a single mechanism, since only
the fast branch shows the prominent snail shell feature. The hotter orbits may have phase-wrapped away already
due to the much larger dynamical range in radial variation to facilitate faster phase mixing. To explain the lack
of a well-deﬁned snail shell in the hotter orbits, the disk should have been perturbed at least 500 Myr ago.
Our results offer more support to the recent satellite-disk encounter scenario than the internal bar buckling
perturbation scenario as the origin of the phase space mixing. Origin of the more prominent snail shell in the
Vφ color-coded phase space is also discussed.

The Milky Way disk is not in a complete dynamical equi-

that is phase mixing in both horizontal and vertical direc-
tions. Since the full phase-space information of individual
stars may be obtained, the Milky Way is unique and valu-
able to reveal the disk dynamical evolution in detail. The
picture of the Milky Way evolution is complicated, which
is affected by both internal and external perturbations. The
resonances of the bar and spiral arms can signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
ence the stellar orbits to cause the radial migration in the disk
(Friedli et al. 1994; Sellwood & Binney 2002; Roškar et al.
2008; Minchev & Famaey 2010) and to generate substruc-
tures in the velocity phase space for stars in the solar neigh-
borhood (Dehnen 2000; Fux 2001; Antoja et al. 2009, 2011;
Quillen et al. 2011; Hunt & Bovy 2018). Large scale bulk
motions observed in the Galactic disk (e.g., Siebert et al.
2011; Carlin et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2015; Tian et al. 2017;
Wang et al. 2018a,b) could also be induced from dynamical
processes related to the bar and spiral arms (Siebert et al.
2012; Debattista 2014; Faure et al. 2014; Monari et al. 2015,
2016). Moreover, satellite galaxies or sub-halos interact-
ing with the Milky Way can perturb the disk to generate
warps, ﬂares or other vertical motions such as the bending and
breathing features in the outer disk (Hunter & Toomre 1969;
Quinn et al. 1993; Kazantzidis et al. 2008; Purcell et al. 2011;

Laporte et al. 2018a,b).

Using the revolutionary Gaia data Antoja et al. (2018) dis-
covered clear evidence of vertical phase mixing in the solar
neighborhood for the ﬁrst time. A clear snail shell can be
seen in the Z −VZ phase space. As ﬁrst shown in Laporte et al.
(2019), the phase space snail shell is also prominent in the
number density contrast map. This feature can be understood
as the phase mixing process in a vertically perturbed disk,
where the vertical oscillation frequency depends on the oscil-
lation amplitude, generating a snail shell structure in Z − VZ
space (Tremaine 1999; Antoja et al. 2018). Candlish et al.
(2014) investigated the evolution of the phase mixing pro-
cess for disrupting star clusters that show development and
winding of a phase space spiral due to the anharmonic os-
cillation5. In fact, the concept of phase mixing/wrapping has
been implied in several previous works. Minchev et al. (2009)
showed that an unrelaxed disk can produce wave-like features
in the velocity phase space that get closer due to the phase
wrapping. As shown in Quillen et al. (2009), external per-
turbations could excite phase mixing for stars in the disk to
induce streams in the velocity distribution. de la Vega et al.
(2015) found that phase wrapping excited by external pertur-
bations might account for the bending and breathing modes
in the disk. The North/South asymmetry in the vertical stellar
number density proﬁle discovered in Widrow et al. (2012) is
also a reﬂection of the snail shell with all the stars projected
on the Z axis.

The phase space snail shell shows up more clearly when
color-coded with azimuthal velocity (Vφ) of stars (Fig. 1c
in Antoja et al. 2018), which was suggested to indicate
the tight correlation between the in-plane and vertical mo-
tions. The two motions are clearly entangled, but there are
still important details to be clariﬁed (Binney & Schönrich

2018; Darling & Widrow 2019). Laporte et al. (2019) found
snail shell at different stellar age bins, and the shape
of the snail changes systematically across the Galactic
disk.
Similar results are also obtained in other studies
(Tian et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2019). One possible cul-
prit of the vertical perturbation is the merging Sagittar-
ius dwarf with the last pericentric passage occurred at
∼
300 − 900 Myr ago (Antoja et al. 2018; Binney & Schönrich
2018; Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2019; Laporte et al. 2019). The
other competing scenario is the spontaneous bending waves
as a source of
long lived internal vertical perturber
(Chequers & Widrow 2017), also including the perturbation
from a bar buckling event (Khoperskov et al. 2019).

It has been well known that the velocity phase space in
the solar neighborhood, e.g., VR − Vφ, shows complex kine-
matic substructures, known as “moving groups” (Dehnen
1998; Skuljan et al. 1999; Famaey et al. 2005; Antoja et al.
2008). Gaia revealed new conﬁgurations in the phase space,
which are the multiple arches in the VR − Vφ space and di-
agonal ridges in the R − Vφ space (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2018a; Antoja et al. 2018). The arches appear for the whole
range of azimuthal velocity, with all the classical moving
groups embedded in the more extended arched substructures
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018a). Ramos et al. (2018) re-
marked that the more roundish moving groups and the elon-
gated arches are morphologically different entities, with some
moving groups belonging to the same arch. To the ﬁrst order,
the velocity phase space could be considered as an assem-
bly of arches. Previous studies argued that internal dynam-
ical effects of structures in the Galactic disk mainly gener-
ate kinematic features with radial velocity (U) and azimuthal
velocity (V ) with respect to the local circular motion within
50 km/s (Minchev et al. 2009). On the other hand, stars
∼
with larger radial and azimuthal velocities resembling arc-like
features in the U − V plane may be related to the disk ringing
effect caused by external interactions with satellite galaxies
(Minchev et al. 2009; Gómez et al. 2012).

Considering the different internal or external origins of the
arches, the connection between the arches and previous verti-
cal perturbation events is still an open question. For example,
Michtchenko et al. (2019) reported that the snail shell is only
produced by the classical moving groups, with no evidence of
incomplete vertical phase mixing from external perturbations.
This apparent inconsistency with other works needs to be bet-
ter understood by properly dissecting the velocity phase space
into distinct arches. Here we utilize the second Gaia data re-
lease (DR2) with radial velocity, proper motions and parallax
available to investigate the properties of different arches in
the Z − VZ phase space. Hopefully, this study will shed light
on the origin of the snail shell and the correlation between the
in-plane and vertical motions. The sample is described in §2.
The results are shown and discussed in §3, and summarized
in §4.

2. SAMPLE
2.1. Sample Selection
Gaia DR2 opens a new era of precise stellar dynam-
ics, providing astrometric parameters for 1.3 billion sources
down to G
21 mag, as well as line-of-sight velocities
for 7.2 million stars brighter than 12 mag, with the me-
dian parallax uncertainty for bright sources (G < 14 mag) at
0.03 mas and the proper motion uncertainty at 0.07 mas/yr
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018b). We adopted the same sam-

Arches are separated with the dotted lines. Table 1 also lists the classical
moving groups and the corresponding arches that they belong to.

ple selection as Antoja et al. (2018), i.e., selecting stars with
positive parallaxes ϖ with relative uncertainty less than 20%
(ϖ/σϖ > 5). As pointed out by Antoja et al. (2018), the sam-
ple selection makes 1/ϖ a reasonably good distance estimator
(Schönrich & Aumer 2017; Luri et al. 2018).

The sample consists of 6.2 million stars, covering the re-
gion with 4 < R < 13 kpc. Following Antoja et al. (2018), we
adopt (X⊙, Y⊙, Z⊙) = (−8.34, 0, 0.027) kpc as the Sun posi-
tion (Reid et al. 2014). The local standard of rest (LSR) circu-
lar velocity VLSR is set to 240 km/s (Reid et al. 2014). Here we
adopt the peculiar velocities of the Sun with respect to LSR
as (U⊙,V⊙,W⊙) = (11.1, 12.24, 7.25) km/s (Schönrich 2012).
Our main results are not affected if we choose other measure-
ments of the solar peculiar motion, e.g., Tian et al. (2015)
or Huang et al. (2015). The typical velocity uncertainty is
about 1 km/s for the radial, azimuthal, and vertical velocities
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018b; Antoja et al. 2018).

In this study, we select the stars in a narrow annulus in the

0.1 kpc), which contains

solar neighborhood (R = 8.34
∼
±
0.93 million stars. The VR − Vφ phase space distribution of
stars in the solar neighborhood is known to show a variety
of arches and clumps. The position of the major arches are
consistent with recent works (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018a;
Antoja et al. 2018; Ramos et al. 2018). We conﬁrm that the
stars in this sample show the same snail shells in the Z − VZ
phase space when color-coded with the number density, VR,
and Vφ as in Antoja et al. (2018).

To evaluate the inﬂuence of the parallax bias in the Gaia
catalog, we also tested our results with the parallax corrected
Gaia sample (Schönrich et al. 2019). The parallax corrected
sample size is reduced to 60% of that used here. The snail
shell patterns in both samples are in excellent agreement; our
results and main conclusions are unaffected by the parallax
correction, since most of the stars are still very close to the
solar neighborhood.

We further dissect the sample in the VR −Vφ phase space into
different arches containing the classical moving groups, e.g.,
Sirius, Hyades, Coma Berenices (hereafter Coma for brevity),
Pleiades, and Hercules. By applying the Stationary Wavelet
Transform (Starck & Murtagh 2002) on the VR − Vφ distribu-
tion of Gaia DR2 data in the solar neighborhood, Ramos et al.
(2018) identiﬁed 12 arches (A1 to A12). Adopting the posi-
tions and extensions of the arches in Ramos et al. (2018), we
dissect the velocity phase space into different regions corre-
sponding to these 12 arches.

We identify the gaps between these arches by adjusting the
contrast level of the number density map (see Appendix for
more information). Fig. 1 shows the arches separated by the
dotted lines in the velocity phase space. Clearly, the arches
are well separated.6 The classical moving groups, such as the
Sirius, Coma and Hyades-Pleiades, are embedded in arches
A4, A5, and A7, respectively. Note that arches A8 and A9
together form the Hercules stream (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2018a; Ramos et al. 2018). Considering their azimuthal ve-
locity difference, we refer to A8 as the Hercules Fast branch
with median Vφ
209 km/s, and A9 as the Hercules Slow
branch with median Vφ
202 km/s. Properties of the arches
are listed in Table 1. VZ is not considered when classifying
arches.

To further increase the visibility of the snail shell, we gen-

inter-shell region in the ∆N map has values typically less than

showing only those regions with ∆N

−0.03.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

6 Arches A10 and A11 are grouped together due to the ambient boundary

between them.

3.1. Dissecting the Phase Space Snail Shell
The Z −VZ phase space distributions of the arches are shown
in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, which are color-coded with number den-
sity N, number density contrast ∆N, enhanced map, radial ve-
locity VR and azimuthal velocity Vφ. The arches are grouped
according to the prominence of the phase space snail shell.
The arches with prominent snail shells are shown in Fig. 2,
arches with moderate snail shells in Fig. 3, and arches with
indistinct snail shells in Fig. 4.

In Fig. 2, for each arch, the snail shells revealed in N, ∆N
and enhanced maps are almost identical. The snail shell pat-
tern is slightly different in the VR and Vφ color-coded phase
space compared to the number density map, but the ampli-
tude contrast of the snail shell is only 2 − 4 km/s. This may be
due to the variation of the snail shell shape with the radial or
azimuthal velocities for each arch, which will be discussed in
greater detail in Section 3.5. For arch A8, there seems to be
no visible snail shell in the VR or Vφ color-coded phase space.
From the VR − Vφ phase space in Fig. 1, it seems that the
snail shell only exists for arches with 210 . Vφ . 270 km/s
(i.e.,
. 30 km/s). This velocity range corresponds
to the dynamically colder orbits, which are closer to circular
orbits. Stars with velocities outside that region are denoted as
hotter orbits.

Vφ − VLSR

We also quantify the amplitude/contrast of the snail shell.
For the Z − VZ phase space distribution of each arch, along a
constant Z slit, ∆N proﬁle as a function of VZ is extracted. The
Z slit range listed in Table 1 is purposely chosen to cut through
the shell (local maximum) and inter-shell regions (local min-
imum). Proﬁles of the number density contrast are shown in
Fig. 5. The colder orbits (top panel) show large ﬂuctuations
with a similar zigzag pattern due to the multiple intersections
of the snail shell with the slit, while the hotter orbits (mid-
dle panel) show roughly ﬂat proﬁles with small ﬂuctuations,
indicating the weak or indistinct snail shell in the hotter or-
bits. To quantify the amplitude of the snail shell, in each pro-
ﬁle, we measure the difference between the maximum value
within −30 < VZ < −20 km/s and the minimum value within
−20 < VZ < 10 km/s. The results are also listed in Table 1.
Clearly, the amplitude/contrast of the snail shell in colder or-
bits (
0.3) is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the hotter orbits
(

∼
0.03).

FIG. 2.— The Z − VZ phase space of arches A4, A5, A7 and A8 showing prominent snail shell pattern. From left to right, the columns correspond to the
phase space distribution color-coded with number density N, number density contrast ∆N, density enhanced map, radial velocity VR and azimuthal velocity Vφ,
respectively. Each pixel corresponds to 0.02 kpc × 1.2 km/s. The Gaussian kernel width used to construct the density contrast map is empirically chosen as 14
pixels to best highlight the snail shell. Note that in the VR and Vφ color-coded phase space, the median value has been subtracted.

Fig. 6 shows the phase space distributions for all the stars
on colder orbits (top row; including A3, A4, A5, A6, A7,
and A8) and hotter orbits (bottom row; including A1, A2, A9,
A10, A11, and A12). Stars on the colder orbits clearly show
a very prominent snail shell in the number density (left) and
Vφ color-coded phase space (right), and a slightly weaker snail
shell in the VR color-coded phase space (middle). On the other
hand, the hotter orbits (the bottom row) do not exhibit the
clear snail shells in the number density, VR or Vφ color-coded
phase spaces. If the phase space snail shell really exists in the
hotter orbits, it is signiﬁcantly blurred or incoherent. The bot-
tom panel in Fig. 5 compares the density proﬁles between the
combined colder and hotter orbits, conﬁrming our argument
for the prominent snail shell in the colder orbits only. No-
tice that in Fig. 6, for the colder orbits, the snail shell patterns
between the ∆N and Vφ color-coded phase spaces are differ-
ent. This probably indicates that the snail shell shape varies
across the arches in the colder orbits. This will be discussed
in greater detail in Section 3.5.

As shown in Fig. 4, the phase space distributions of arches

A10, A11 and A12 are more elongated along the VZ axis than
arches A1 and A2. This is consistent with simple theoreti-
cal expectation of approximately harmonic oscillators. The
difference between the median azimuthal velocities of the
arches at high and low Vφ is
100 km/s, corresponding to
∼
3.5 kpc in terms of the difference in the guiding radius
∼
(Rg)7. Therefore, compared to the arch at higher Vφ, stars
with lower Vφ have much smaller Rg, where both the verti-
cal oscillation frequency and vertical velocity amplitude are
ΩzZmax), resulting in a more elongated dis-
larger (VZ,max
tribution along the vertical velocity axis in the Z − VZ phase
space. This simple argument is also consistent with the snail
shape variation found by Laporte et al. (2019) in their Fig. 15
for a region centered on R = 6 kpc, which is more elongated
along the VZ axis compared to the snail shell at R = 10 kpc.
Similar results are also seen in Wang et al. (2019).

of the radial oscillation (or “hotness”) of orbits. We use
the action-based galaxy modeling package AGAMA (Vasiliev
2019) to directly compute JR of each star in our sample, with
the best-ﬁt potential from McMillan (2011) adopted. JR has
the dimension of angular momentum. Its unit in our paper
is kpc2Myr−1. Fig. 7 shows the JR color-coded VR − Vφ phase
space distribution of our sample. As expected, JR is smaller
for nearly circular orbits with velocity closer to the circular
velocity of the LSR. Fig. 8 shows the Z − VZ phase space
distributions for stars in different JR ranges. The snail shell
becomes much weaker for increasingly larger JR values; the
snail shell is indistinct with JR > 0.04. This phenomenon is
expected since stars with large JR occupy a wide range of
guiding radius distribution, resulting in a signiﬁcantly blurred
snail shell. Moreover, hotter stars respond poorly to dynami-
cal perturbations.

This could also explain why the snail shells of arches A3
and A6 shown in Fig. 3 are not as prominent as those in Fig. 2
(for A4, A5, A7, and A8). Stars in A3 and A6 have large
radial action (JR > 0.04) to blur the snail shell feature.

In Fig. 7, the red ellipse represents the contour of JR = 0.04,
which agrees well with the azimuthal velocity ranges of colder
orbits marked with the two black dashed lines. The Z − VZ
phase space distributions of stars with JR < 0.04 and JR > 0.04
are shown in Fig. 9. Clear snail shell can only be seen for the
subsample with JR < 0.04. The lower panels with JR > 0.04
show a signiﬁcantly blurred or incoherent snail shell feature.
This agrees with Fig. 6, conﬁrming that hotter orbits (with
larger radial oscillation) do not show prominent snail shell in
the phase space. Arches A3 and A6 are partially included
in the sample with JR > 0.04 to result in a blurred snail shell
feature in the lower right panel of Fig. 9 for the Vφ color-coded
phase space.

The median JR of our sample is 0.018, which is very similar
to the result in Bland-Hawthorn et al. (2019) within a few per-
0.0195 after being converted to our unit). The larger
cent (

∼

JR subsample (above the median JR) of Bland-Hawthorn et al.
(2019) shows a weak phase space snail shell. Apparently,
their high JR subsample contains a signiﬁcant fraction of
colder orbits deﬁned by us, thus giving rise to the weak snail
shell.

3.2. Two Branches of the Hercules Stream
The Hercules stream, as a prominent low azimuthal veloc-
ity structure in the velocity phase space, has been extensively
studied in the literature. Stellar spectra of individual stars
in the stream suggest multiple stellar populations with dif-
ferent ages and metallicities, arguing against the stream as
a disrupted stellar cluster or the debris of a satellite galaxy
(Famaey et al. 2005; Bensby et al. 2007). Previous theoretical
works have suggested that the Hercules stream is due to the
dynamical effects of the bar and/or spiral arms (Dehnen 2000;
Antoja et al. 2014; Pérez-Villegas et al. 2017; Hunt & Bovy
2018).

Gaia DR2 showed that

the Hercules stream is com-
posed of two branches at different azimuthal velocities
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018a; Ramos et al. 2018). For the
two branches of the Hercules stream, it is surprising to see that
only the fast branch (arch A8; bottom row in Fig. 2) shows
the prominent snail shell but not for the slow branch (arch
A9; middle row in Fig. 4). This difference should be physical
and not due to small number statistics, since the slow branch
(A9) even has
40% more stars than the fast branch (A8)
as listed in Table 1. Therefore, the Hercules stream may not
be a homogeneous kinematic structure. If the two branches
can be explained by a single mechanism, then it is difﬁcult
to understand the difference in the vertical phase space distri-
butions, considering the small azimuthal velocity difference
(

7 km/s) between the two branches.

3.3. Phase Mixing in Colder and Hotter Orbits

6

FIG. 4.— The Z −VZ phase space of arches A1, A2, A9, A10, A11 and A12 showing blurred or absent snail shell feature. The layout is the same with Fig. 2.
The snail shells here are indistinct compared to Figs. 2 and 3.

The snail shell in the Z − VZ phase space reﬂects the ver-
tical phase mixing with anharmonic oscillation (Antoja et al.
2018). Stars with larger vertical action JZ have smaller ver-
tical oscillation frequency ΩZ (Binney & Schönrich 2018).
Binney & Schönrich (2018) also showed that ΩZ depends sen-
sitively on Vφ, with smaller ΩZ at larger Vφ, which forms
a narrow and sequential distribution in ΩZ − √JZ plane for
each Vφ; the snail shell shape may change slightly at differ-
ent Vφ. Our result shows clear phase space snail shells for
stars in individual arch on the colder orbits. The snail shell

shapes of these arches are also slightly different from each
other as shown in Fig. 2. This is roughly consistent with
Binney & Schönrich (2018); each arch usually has a small
Vφ range, which corresponds nicely to a narrow strip in the
ΩZ − √JZ plane to induce a clear phase space snail shell.

Binney & Schönrich (2018) suggested that the unclear snail
shell in the phase space number density distribution observed
in Antoja et al. (2018) is due to the fact that stars lie in a
“broad swath” in the ΩZ − √JZ plane. As shown in the top
left panel of Fig. 6, all the stars on colder orbits combined to-

density distribution. These results may indicate that the distri-
bution of stars on colder orbits in the ΩZ − √JZ plane is more
well-deﬁned and narrower than “a broad swath”.

Both the analytical estimation and simple test particle simu-
lations using galpy8 (Bovy 2015) with the MWPotential2014

bits (. 0.7 kpc).

local sample from a range of guiding radii. As shown in
Bland-Hawthorn et al. (2019), given the same amplitude of
the vertical perturbation, stars on circular orbits at larger ra-
dius will form a more loosely winding phase space snail shell
at lower vertical oscillation frequency than the stars on cir-
cular orbits at smaller radius. The snail shell at larger radius
becomes more elongated in the Z direction, but reduced in the
VZ direction (Ωz
VZ,max/Zmax). Due to the large radial range
of the hotter orbits, the elongation of the Z −VZ phase space el-
lipse changes during its radial oscillation, leading to a blurred
distribution and faster phase mixing.

∼

Stars on the hotter orbits have probably phase-wrapped
away already to show signiﬁcantly blurred and indistinct snail
shell, while the stars on the colder orbits are still in the pro-
cess of vertical phase mixing. To demonstrate this argu-
ment we perform a simple simulation with 100,000 test parti-
cles in a realistic Milky Way potential (Irrgang et al. 2013;
Antoja et al. 2018) to track the evolution of the hotter and

colder orbits. Note that our test particle simulation is de-
signed to mimic an external vertical perturbation. We have
veriﬁed that it can well reproduce the simulation results in
Antoja et al. (2018), e.g., their Fig. 3a and Extended Figs. 3a
and 3b.

To consider the fact that the perturbation happened in the
past, and we observe the stars in the solar neighborhood at
present, we retro-tracked the orbits to make sure their present
location is indeed near the solar radius. Initially all test parti-
cles are distributed around R = 8.34 kpc with median Vφ = 280
km/s (σφ = 15 km/s) and median VR = 0 km/s (σR = 20 km/s),
representing arches A1 and A2 at higher Vφ. Then the particle
orbits are integrated backwards without vertical perturbation
(VZ = 0, Z = 0). The distributions of the test particles in X − Y
plane at 300 Myr ago is shown in panel (a1) of Fig. 10. Then
we impose the vertical perturbation on all the particles in two
approaches.

The ﬁrst approach is similar to Antoja et al. (2018), where

history of the Galactic disk.

∼

We have shown that the existence or the lack of the promi-
nent phase space snail shells is connected to the dichotomy of
colder and hotter orbits, and to the different arches in the VR −
Vφ phase space. Our results and explanations strongly argue
against the suggestion that the phase space snail shell is only
produced by the major moving groups with no evidence of
the ongoing vertical phase mixing (Michtchenko et al. 2019).
There are two obvious counter arguments to their suggestion.
Firstly, arches A3 and A6, which do not contain any of the
major moving groups, still show phase space snail shell. Sec-
ondly, the Hercules Slow branch (A9), being a major moving
group, shows no prominent snail shell feature.

3.4. VR and Vφ Color-Coded Phase Spaces
Binney & Schönrich (2018) suggested that the vertical and
radial oscillation frequencies (ΩZ, ΩR) anti-correlate with Vφ
(hence the angular momentum or the guiding radius Rg). Stars
with different Vφ follow a narrow and sequential trend in the
ΩZ − √JZ plane, leading to the formation of the snail shell in
the Vφ color-coded phase space. On the other hand, faster
ΩR leads to faster change of VR. Therefore, the VR color-
coded phase space shears into a spiral that differs from the Vφ
color-coded phase space spiral in the tightness of the wind-
ing (Binney & Schönrich 2018). Different simulations also
indicate that the coupled motions in horizontal and verti-
cal directions lead to clear snail shells in VR and Vφ color-
coded phase spaces (Darling & Widrow 2019; Laporte et al.
2019). In particular, the bar buckling perturbation scenario
predicts the most clear snail shell in VR color-coded phase
space (Khoperskov et al. 2019).

However, for some arches in colder orbits, VR or Vφ color-
coded phase spaces show no clear snail shell (see Fig. 2). It
may be understandable for arches with a narrow range of Vφ.
For example, the Vφ range of arch A4 (Sirius) is only 15 km/s,
which is difﬁcult to highlight snail shell (with larger ∆Vφ) in
the Vφ color-coded phase space. In Fig. 6, if we combine all
the stars on colder orbits, a moderate snail shell in Vφ (and
even weaker in VR) color-coded phase space is present. These
results suggest that the coupling between the in-plane and ver-
tical motions may be weaker for the colder orbits than previ-
ously expected.

3.5. The Enhanced Snail Shell in the Vφ Color-Coded Phase

Space

Mathematically speaking, the Vφ color-coded phase space
in Antoja et al. (2018) is just the number weighted average
of the azimuthal velocity of all the arches. In an ideal case,
imagine that there is only one arch at some Vφ and a feature-
less background at lower Vφ. If all the stars in this arch are ar-
ranged into a snail shell shape in Z −VZ number density phase
space, then the combination with the smooth background at
lower Vφ naturally results in a pronounced snail shell color-
coded in Vφ, which, in principle, has the same shape as the
snail shell in the number density distribution.

To demonstrate this argument, we create a featureless back-
ground by combining all the stars on the hotter orbits9. The

and Vφ, respectively.

the test particles are displaced vertically (median Z = −0.3
kpc and VZ = 0 km/s with dispersions of 0.2 kpc and 2 km/s).
For the 300 Myr case, after the perturbation, the Z − VZ phase
space distribution is shown in panel (a3) of Fig. 10. After 300
Myr evolution, almost all the test particles now arrive in the
solar radius as shown in panel (a2) in the X − Y plane, with a
snail shell feature in the number density contrast map (∆N) of
the Z − VZ phase space distribution in panel (a4). In addition,
we test to impose the same vertical perturbation on test parti-
cles at 400, 500, 600, and 700 Myr ago. The number density
contrast map (∆N) of the ﬁnal Z −VZ phase space distributions
of the four tests are shown in Panels (b1)−(b4) in Fig. 10.

In the second approach, under the impulsive approxima-
tion of the external perturbation (Binney & Schönrich 2018),
a vertical velocity kick is imposed to all the test particles
with the vertical positions barely changed (median Z = 0 and
VZ = −10 km/s with dispersion of 0.02 kpc and 10 km/s). Pan-
els (a1) − (a4) and (b1) − (b4) in Fig. 11 show the test particle
simulation results. Combining Figs. 10 and 11, it seems that
the snail shell becomes blurred or indistinct if the perturbation

was imposed at least
For comparison, we perform similar test particle simulation
on colder orbits in arch A4 (Sirius). The test results are shown
in Fig. 12. Clearly, the snail becomes more tightly wound
with the perturbation imposed at earlier stages. Compared to
the snail shell shape in Fig. 2 for the colder orbits, test particle
500 − 600 Myr ago
simulations with perturbations imposed
seem to agree well with the snail shell shape displayed by the
colder orbits in Fig. 2.

∼

∼

The test particle simulations support our conclusions on the
faster phase mixing of the hotter orbits. It seems that the ver-
tical phase mixing should have started at least 500 Myr ago,
or there is not enough time for the snail shell pattern in hotter
orbits to phase-mix away. Our result helps put tighter con-
straints on the vertical perturbation event of the Milky Way
300 − 900 Myr ago
disk, which was suggested to occur
(Antoja et al. 2018). The lack of snail shell pattern can of-
fer a new perspective, and can place important constraints on
the occurrence time of the phase mixing event.

∼

Clearly, these test particle simulations still have limitations.
For example, Darling & Widrow (2019) found that the phase
space snail becomes less wound in a self-consistent simula-

background is then combined with each arch on the colder or-
bits, namely, A4, A5, A7, and A8. Clear snail shells can be
seen in the Vφ color-coded phase space of each composition
shown in Fig. 13. Consistent with our expectation, for each
arch in Fig. 13, the shape of the Vφ color-coded snail shell is
consistent with the corresponding ∆N map as shown in Fig. 2.
On the other hand, if we combine arches with different snail
shell shapes at different Vφ, then the outcome color-coded
with Vφ (or VR) will be a snail shell slightly different from
the number density map of the combination. To test this ar-
gument, we combine arches A4 and A7 together. The result

is shown in Fig. 14. Apparently, the number density contrast
map and VR and Vφ color-coded phase spaces show slightly
different snail shell shapes, especially in the inner region of
the phase space. This is mainly due to the different snail shell
shapes between the two arches. From Fig. 2, we can see that
the shapes of the snail shell of the arches are not identical,
especially in the central part of the phase space. Therefore,
combining the arches in the colder orbits would result in dif-
ferent snail shell shapes between the number density map and
the Vφ (or VR) color-coded phase spaces, as shown in Figs. 6
and 9. As shown in Fig. 2, for each arch on colder orbits, the
snail shell shapes are also different between the number den-
sity map and Vφ (or VR) color-coded phase spaces, although
the amplitude contrast of the snail shell is only 2 − 4 km/s.
This is probably due to the slight variation of the snail shell

shape with Vφ (or VR) for stars in each arch.

To summarize, it is the colder orbits that manifest the effect
of ongoing vertical phase mixing, with the hotter orbits pro-
viding a featureless background to highlight the snail shell of
the colder orbits in the Vφ color-coded phase space. Moreover,
combining the arches on colder orbits could result in different
snail shell shapes color-coded in VR or Vφ compared to the
number density map.

4. SUMMARY

We provide a new perspective to understand the origin of
the snail shell in the Z −VZ phase space and its dependence on
the radial and azimuthal velocities with the Gaia DR2 data.
We identify arches in the VR − Vφ phase space, which include
classical “moving groups” or “kinematic streams”. Connec-
tion between the arches and the snail shell is investigated in
detail. Interestingly, the snail shell only exists for stars on the
colder orbits (
. 30 km/s). Arches A3 (γLeo), A4
(Sirius), A5 (Coma), A6, A7 (Hyades-Pleiades), and A8 (Her-
cules Fast) all show prominent or moderate snail shell in the
phase space number density distribution, but not for the arches
A1, A2, A9 (Hercules Slow), A10, A11, and A12 (Arcturus),
which are mainly composed of stars on hotter orbits.

The snail shell shapes are slightly different for the arches on
the colder orbits. The amplitude of the snail shell is quantiﬁed
by the difference between the local maximum and minimum
of the ∆N proﬁle along a narrow Z slit in the phase space.

than those of the hotter orbits (

We use the radial action JR to quantify the extent of the ra-

12

dial oscillation (“hotness”) of orbits. The snail shell becomes
much weaker for larger JR values, and essentially disappears
with JR > 0.04. Thus one should focus more on the colder or-
bits in the future phase mixing study, with stars on the hotter
orbits removed.

We also conﬁrm that the Hercules stream is composed of
two branches with different Vφ. Only the fast branch (A8)
shows the prominent snail shell, but not the slow branch (A9).
The Hercules stream may not be a homogeneous kinematic
structure, which probably formed via different physical pro-
cesses.

It seems that stars on hotter orbits have sufﬁciently phase-
mixed to show signiﬁcantly blurred and indistinct snail shell
in the Z − VZ space. The hotter orbits typically have much
larger dynamical range in the disk than the colder orbits.
Therefore, stars on hotter orbits make blurred elliptical ro-
tation in the Z − VZ phase space, which leads to faster phase
mixing. These results help to put tighter constraints on the
vertical perturbation history of the Milky Way disk. To ex-
plain the lack of snail shell in the hotter orbits, the Milky Way
disk should be perturbed at least 500 Myr ago.

Khoperskov et al. (2019) proposed that during the buckling
process, the bar can generate bending waves in the disk to
form the phase space snail shell. The bar buckling scenario
predicts more pronounced snail shell in the VR color-coded
phase space, rather than the Vφ or number density color-coded
phase space. However, this is not seen in our results. They
also suggested that the snail shell can sustain for
4 Gyr due
to the persistence of the bending wave in the disk. It is not
clear if this scenario could explain the lack of snail shells in
hotter orbits. In addition, the contribution of the bar buckling
mechanism on the Milky Way disk vertical perturbation may
be much weaker compared to that of the Sagittarius dwarf
(Laporte et al. 2019). Also this bar buckling scenario may
have some difﬁculties explaining recent observations on phase
space distributions of different stellar populations (Tian et al.
2018; Laporte et al. 2019). Apparently, more theoretical ef-
forts are needed in the future to better constrain the time of
impact and to potentially determine the mass of the perturber.

∼

The coupling between the in-plane and vertical motions for
the colder orbits may be weaker than previously thought.

The colder/hotter dichotomy in terms of the appearance of
the phase space snail shell also provides a natural explana-
tion on the signiﬁcant snail shell in the Vφ color-coded phase
space. Since only the colder orbits exhibit the effect of ongo-
ing vertical phase mixing, the featureless phase space distri-
bution of the hotter orbits provides a background to highlight
the snail shell of the colder orbits in the Vφ color-coded phase
space. Moreover, combining the colder orbits together could
result in different snail shell shapes in the VR or Vφ color-
coded phase space compared to that in the number density
map.

ARCHES IDENTIFICATION

The normalized empirical density distribution of the VR − Vφ phase space is estimated with 1

1 (km/s)2 bin size. With the
wavelet transform method, Ramos et al. (2018) found the locations and extensions of the arches in the VR − Vφ space. To classify
stars into different arches, it is necessary to determine the gaps between these arches identiﬁed in Ramos et al. (2018). Across the
VR − Vφ phase space, the stellar number density could vary up to two orders of magnitude from one arch to another, also for the
gaps between the different arches. In fact, gaps between the arches with different number densities can be better visualized with
different display contrast, i.e., changing the minimum and maximum number densities to be shown in the phase space. Fig. 15
illustrates the VR −Vφ phase space distribution of our sample with different number density contrast. The left panel has the lowest
10−5), highlighting the arches with the lowest number density, i.e., A1,
number density threshold (between 1.0
A2, A10, A11, and A12. Due to the ambient boundary between A10 and A11, they are not separated but grouped as a single arch
10−4,
in the analysis. In the middle panel, the lower and upper number density thresholds are increased to 4.5
respectively, leaving gaps at the higher number density visible. Arches A3, A6, A8, and A9 can be well separated. The right
10−4
panel in Fig. 15 highlights the three major arches in the highest density region with number density threshold between 1.0
and 3.0

10−4, namely, A4 (Sirius), A5 (Coma) and A7 (Hyades and Pleiades).
