A Two-Stage Coordinative Zonal Volt/VAR 
Control Scheme for Distribution Systems with 
High Inverter-based Resources

Abstract--This  paper  presents  a  two-stage  zonal  Volt/VAR 
control  scheme  for  coordinating  inverter-based  resources  (IBR) 
with utility-owned voltage regulators (VR) to regulate voltage in 
unbalanced  3-phase  distribution  systems.  First,  correlations 
between nodal voltages are derived from nodal voltage sensitivity 
studies.  Then,  the  feeder  is  partitioned  into  non-overlapping, 
weakly-coupled  voltage  control  zones  based  on  nodal  voltage 
correlations.    IBR  are  used  in  the  first  stage  to  regulate  voltage 
changes  continuously  and  VR  are  used  in  the  second  stage  to 
regulate large voltage deviations.  An online VR voltage setpoint 
tuning strategy is developed to reduce excessive tap changes and 
avoid  large  voltage  fluctuations  without  retrofitting  existing  VR 
controllers.  In  addition,  the  proposed  algorithm  uses  real-time 
voltage measurements only from the critical nodes (typically less 
than 4% of total nodes) to reduce the sensing and communication 
needs. Actual distribution feeder topologies and load and PV time-
series  data  are  used  to  verify  the  performance  of  the  algorithm. 
Because  the  method  is  a  rule-based  approach,  it  runs  extremely 
fast, requires fewer measurements, and requires no retrofit to the 
existing VR control mechanisms. Simulation results show that the 
performance of the proposed method in terms of voltage control 
results and average numbers of VR tap changes are satisfactory.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

I 

N power distribution system, conventional Volt/VAR control 
(VVC)  relies  mainly  on  utility-owned  voltage  control 
devices,  such  as  capacitor  banks,  on-load  tap  changers 
(OLTC),  and  step-type  voltage  regulators  (SVRs).  In  recent 
years,  distribution  systems  with  high-penetration  of  inverter-
based resources (IBRs), primarily photovoltaic (PV) systems, 
have  seen  a  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of  switching  of 
Volt-VAR  devices,  significant  shortening  their  equipment 
lifespan [1].  Although IBRs’ variable power outputs can cause 
larger,  more  frequent  voltage  fluctuations  than  passive  loads, 
the superb real and reactive power regulating capability of IBRs 
also  makes  them  potential  high-quality  VVC  resources. 
However, because the distributed nature of IBRs, it is essential 
that a coordinative VVC scheme is developed so that they can 
work with conventional VVC devices in harmony to maintain 
nodal voltages within operational limits and reduce losses. 

A  common  approach  for  distribution  system  VCC  is  to 
formulate an optimal reactive power flow problem that is solved 
either  centrally or distributedly [2-7]. A centralized approach 
assumes that a centralized controller has full observability and 
controllability  of  all  controllable  devices  (including  utility-
owned VVC device and IBRs). Thus, by determining the on/off 
status  or  computing  the  optimal  voltage  setpoints  of  those 
devices,  the  optimization  objectives,  such  as  minimizing 
voltage  fluctuations,  losses,  the  number  of  switching,  or 
operation costs can be achieved.  

Although  the  centralized  VVC  has  the  advantage  of 
achieving global optimum when controlling voltage within the 
operational limits at both the local and system levels, it  relies 
the  availability  of  high-quality,  wide-band  2-way 
on 
of 
communication 
sensor/actuator on IBRs and utility VVC devices, making large-
scale implementations cost prohibitive.

and  wide 

networks 

Because  voltage  issues  can  be  best  resolved  at  the  place 
where  a  voltage  violation  occurs,  optimization-based,  zonal 
VVC approaches draw increasing attention in recent years. The 
zone-based  method  approach  first  partitions  a  distribution 
network into non-overlapping zones and then decomposes the 
VVC optimization problem into sub-problems, each optimizing 
the control actions inside a VVC zone. In [8-13], a number of 
partition  methods  are 
including  K-means 
clustering, spectral clustering, affinity propagation clustering, 
community  detection,  binary  particle  swarm  optimization 
(BPSO), and power flow tracing and agglomerative algorithms. 
In [14, 15], the authors break a distribution feeder into several 
zones  based  on  the  service  area  and  operation  reach  of  a 
regulating  device  to  reduce  computational  complexity  and 
minimize VVC devices switching actions.  

introduced, 

However,  the  aforementioned  optimization-based  zonal 
VVC  approaches  still  require  real-time  observability  of  the 
whole  distribution  feeder  using  state  estimation.  The  main 
challenge  in  distribution  state  estimation  is  that  the  lack  of 
redundant, synchronized, and statistical characterized real-time 
data  in  current  distribution  feeders  [16].  Another  main 
drawback in the existing approach (e.g., [12, 14-15]) is that the 
optimization algorithm yields the optimal tap-position instead 
of the voltage set-point plus a bandwidth used for controlling

an SVR. This adds retrofit costs in field implementation. Thus, 
although the optimization-based control approach can achieve 
satisfactory results on small-scale actual distribution system [8-
9, 12] and/or small IEEE test feeders [9-13], its implementation 
cost  would  be  high  in  distribution  systems  with  hundreds  or 
thousands  of  nodes  supplying  unbalanced  loads  with  high-
penetration of IBRs.  

Therefore,  in  this  paper,  we  developed  a  two-stage, 
coordinative  zonal  VVC  algorithm  to  operate  utility-owned 
VCC  devices  in  conjunction  with  IBRs.  First,  correlations 
between  nodal  voltages  are  derived  from  nodal  voltage 
sensitivity  studies.  Then,  the  feeder  is  partitioned  into  non-
overlapping,  weakly-coupled  voltage  control  zones  based  on 
nodal voltage correlations.  IBRs are used in the first stage to 
regulate voltage changes continuously and VRs are used in the 
second stage to regulate large voltage deviations.  An online VR 
voltage  setpoint  tuning  strategy  is  developed  to  reduce 
excessive  tap  changes  and  avoid  large  voltage  fluctuations 
without  retrofitting  existing  VR  controllers.  In  addition,  the 
algorithm uses  real-time voltage measurements from  only  the 
critical  nodes  (typically  less  than  4%  of  total  nodes).  This 
significantly reduces the sensing and communication needs. 

The contributions of the paper are summarized as follows. 
•  Developed  a  critical  node  identification  method  to 
minimize the monitoring and communication needs. 
•  Developed a coordinative VVC control algorithm that 
uses  IBRs  to  cope  with  fast,  quick  voltage  variations 
while  using  conventional  VVC  devices  to  cope  with 
larger  voltage  excursions  using  measurements  only 
from the critical nodes.  

•  Treated each phase separately to effectively account for 

the unbalanced loads in distribution systems. 

•  Developed a computation-lite, priority-list based zonal 
IBR control scheme for correcting voltage violations in 
each IBR zone.  

•  Used  VVC  control  signals  provided  by  conventional 
VVC devices (i.e., voltage setpoint, bandwidth and time 
delays) so no retrofit is required. 

•  Developed an online voltage setpoint tuning strategy to 
adjust  their  voltage  set-points  of  the  VVC  devices  so 
they  can  ride  through  voltage  fluctuations  caused  by 
IBRs  while  maintaining  voltage  within  the  desired 
operational limits. 

II.  CONVENTIONAL VCC CONTROL MECHANISM 

Conventional  voltage  regulators  (VR),  such  as  SVR  and 
OLTC, are autotransformers equipped with a load tap changing 
mechanism for regulating voltage at their secondary-sides [17]. 
A typical tap changer can provide a  total regulation  range of 
±10%  of  the  nominal  voltage  with  16  steps  up  and  16  steps 
down. This results in 0.625% change per step or 0.75 V change 
per step on a 120 V voltage base.  

As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  there  are  three  adjustable  control 
𝑉𝑅, deadband, 𝐷𝐵𝑉𝑅, and 
𝑉𝑅  [18].  The  secondary  voltage  of  a  voltage

Normally  in  a  long  radial  distribution  feeder,  an  OLTC  is 
located at the feeder head, usually inside a primary substation. 
A  few  SVRs  are  deployed  in  a  cascade  fashion  to  regulation 
voltage along the feeder. Coordination between the OLTC and 
the cascaded SVRs  is achieved by time coordination [14, 15, 
19], i.e. by setting up different 𝑡𝑑 to ensure that VVC actions 
are  taken  sequentially.  In  the  example  given  in  Fig.1,  we 
set 𝑡𝑑

𝑂𝐿𝑇𝐶 < 𝑡𝑑
SVR  has  a  load  drop  compensation  (LDC)  feature  for 
regulating  voltage  at  a  remote  load  center  node  instead  of 
regulating the SVR secondary voltage. Although we did not use 
LDC to develop our method in this paper, the method can be 
readily extended to include LDC.

Conventional VVC devices are tuned and operated assuming 
one-directional  power  flow,  i.e.  voltage  drops  are  one-
directional.  However,  IBRs  can 
the 
distribution  feeder,  causing  voltage  to  increase  in  the  IBR 
nodes. Thus, even if the secondary voltage of a SVR is within 
range,  the voltages of the  downstream nodes may  exceed the 
voltage operation. As shown in Fig. 2, the settings of a VR are: 
𝑉𝑠𝑒𝑡 = 122 𝑉  and 𝐷𝐵 = 4 𝑉.  When  there  is  no  PV  in  the 
downstream nodes, all nodal voltages are within the operation 
limits; when there are PV installed on the downstream nodes, 
voltages at the end nodes will exceed the upper operation limit. 
In the next section, we will introduce the 2-stage coordinative 
VVC  for  managing 
time-
coordination  manner  that  exploits  the  fast  reactive  power 
regulating capability of the IBRs and allow the IBR-based VVC 
to  be  seamlessly  integrated  into  the  existing  VVC  control 
framework.

III.  CONTROL METHODOLOGY 

In  this  section,  we  will  first  give  an  overview  of  the  two-
stage, coordinative zonal Volt/VAR control scheme. Then, the 
critical  node  identification  method  and  the  first-  and  second- 
stage control algorithms are presented. 

A.  An Overview of the Algorithm 

As shown in Fig. 3, to correct voltage violations locally, the 
feeder will be partitioned into 𝐾 IBR control zones (𝐾 = 5 in 
Fig. 3a) and 𝐺 VR control zones (𝐺 = 4 in Fig. 3b). There is 
one IBR controller inside each IBR control zone. The controller 
receives  voltage  measurements  from  the  critical  nodes  its 
control zone. There is one VR controller inside each VR control 
zone. The VR controller can be installed on a VR device (i.e., a 
SVR or an OLTC). The VR controller receives measurements 
from the VR device and the critical nodes inside its zone.

(b) 

Fig. 3. (a) IBR Control Zones and (b) VR Control Zones. 

The  time  coordination  between  the  IBR  and  VR  zones  is 
shown in Fig. 4. In the first stage, a priority-list based reactive 
power  dispatch  algorithm  is  executed  with  a  time  step  of  1-
minute (i.e.,  ∆𝑡 = 1 minute) to decide which IBR in the IBR 
zone will provide the required reactive power support. The first-
stage  control  objective  is  to  continuously  regulate  the  local 
voltage  violations  using  the  superb  reactive  power  regulating 
capability  of  IBRs.  In  the  second  stage,  the  VR  controller 
determines the voltage set-point (i.e., 𝑉𝑆𝑒𝑡) for the SVR or the 
OLTC  at  a  time  step  of  2-minute.  The  second-stage  control 
objective  is  to  remove  voltage  deviations  that  cannot  be 
compensated by IBRs.  

The 

time  coordination  between 

the  upstream  and 
downstream VR devices are done by the time delay settings, as 
shown in the zoom-in plot in Fig. 4.  The time-coordination of 
the  two-stage  coordinative  VVC  exploits  the  fast  reactive 
power regulating capability of IBRs to effectively reduce the 
number of switching of VR devices without depleting the IBR 
reactive power regulation capability.

B.  Critical Nodes Identification 
To  reduce  the  monitoring  and  communication  needs,  we 
identify  a  group  of  critical  nodes  (see  nodes  highlighted  in 
purple in Fig. 3), where extreme voltages (i.e., the nodes with 
the highest or lowest voltages in each zone) are most likely to 
be  observed.  There  are  two  approaches  for  critical  nodes 
identification:  statistic-based  and  model-based.  The  statistic-
based approach can be used if voltage measurements at all load 
nodes  on  a  distribution  feeder  are  available.  If  nodal  voltage 
measurements are not available, a modeling based approach is 
needed to identify the critical nodes.  

In  this  paper,  we  present  a  model-based  approach  using 
Monte-Carlo  simulation.  First,  we  disaggregate  the  yearly 
feeder-head profile (normally available to utilities) to each load 
node using the method introduced by Wang et. al in [20]. Then, 
generate  yearly  PV  outputs  from  solar  irradiance  data  in  the 
area. After that, a yearly quasi-static power flow (365 days at 1-
minute interval) will be run on the test feeder with the targeting 
PV penetration to obtain the hourly feeder voltage distribution. 
This allows us to identify the hours where voltage violations are 
most  likely  to  occur.  In  the  simulation,  we  consider  the  PV 
penetration as the percentage of the peak of the aggregated PV 
output to the peak load on the feeder.  

As  shown  in  Fig.  5,  simulation  results  show  that  voltage 
violations are most likely to happen between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.. 
Therefore,  we  run  power  flow  study 𝐶  times  by  randomly 
sampling PV and nodal load profiles between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.. 
After each run, record the highest and the lowest voltage nodes 
inside each IBR and VR control zone as the critical nodes for 
each zone.  

After  all  𝐶  power  flow  cases  are  completed,  divide  the 
critical nodes obtained into a high-occurrence group, 𝑿, and a 
low-occurrence  group,  𝒀,  based  on 
the  occurrence 
threshold, 𝑇𝐻, so we have

C.  First-stage IBR-based Zonal VVC 

To  implement  the  IBR-based  zonal  VVC,  we  need  to 
partition  the  feeder  into  non-overlapping,  weakly-coupled 
voltage  control  zones  using  nodal  voltage  correlations. 
Specifically, the distribution feeder is divided into 𝐾 PV smart 
inverters zones (IBR  zones) per each phase based on voltage 
reactive power sensitivity correlations using method introduced 
in  [21].  Then,  a  distributed,  priority-list  based  zonal  control 
scheme  is  developed  to  correct  voltage  violations  based  on 
voltage-load  sensitivity.  Note  that  this  is  a  non-optimization 
based approach. Compared with approach introduced in [21], in 
this paper, only voltage measurements from critical nodes are 
used  instead  of  using  voltage  measurements  from  all  nodes 
inside the IBR zone.  

    1)  Clustering Method for IBR Zone Identification 
A fast incremental clustering (FIC) method is used to cluster 
load  nodes  based  on  voltage-load-sensitivity  matrix  (VLSM) 
with respect to reactive power changes, 𝑉𝐿𝑆𝑀𝑄.  First, group 
loads  on  the  same  phase  together  so  that  each  phase  can  be 
in 
treated  separately 
distribution  systems.  Next,  a  power  flow  based  method 
introduced in [22] is used to calculate 𝑉𝐿𝑆𝑀𝑄 as

where 𝑞𝑖,𝑗 is an entry in 𝑉𝐿𝑆𝑀𝑄; 𝑁 is the number of load nodes; 
𝐵𝐴𝑆𝐸 is the base voltage at load node 𝑖 for a given scenario; 
𝑉𝑖
𝑄   is  the 
 ∆𝑄𝑗  is  the  reactive  power  perturbation  at  node 𝑗;  𝑉𝑖,𝑗

Compute 𝑉𝐿𝑆𝑀𝑄 for 1000 scenarios and calculate the mean 
and  the  standard  deviation  of  the  jth  column  of 𝑉𝐿𝑆𝑀𝑄 ,  as 

Fig. 5. Hourly nodal voltage distribution. 

To determine the final set of the critical nodes for each IBR 
and VR control zone, the following two rules are used. First, all 
nodes in 𝑿 are considered as critical nodes. Second, a voltage 
difference test is conducted to decide if a node in 𝒀 is a critical 
node. Assume there are  𝐼𝑤 times in 𝐶 where 𝑦𝑤 was identified 
as a critical node and store the index of those power flow runs 
in 𝐿𝑤.  We  can calculate  the  voltage  difference  between  node 
𝑦𝑤 and all the existing critical nodes in 𝑿 for all  𝐼𝑤 runs in 𝐿𝑤, 
∆𝑉𝑦𝑤, as 

∆𝑉𝑦𝑤 =

First, for the uth critical node in X, 𝑥𝑢 , calculate the maximum 
𝑚𝑎𝑥, as 
voltage difference between 𝑦𝑤 and 𝑥𝑢  in all  𝐼𝑤 runs, ∆𝑉𝑦𝑤,𝑋

∆𝑉𝑦𝑤,𝑋

𝑚𝑎𝑥( 𝑢) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (∆𝑉𝑦𝑤(𝑢, 1:  𝐼𝑤 ))                    (5) 

Then, calculate the smallest ∆𝑉𝑦𝑤,𝑋

𝑚𝑖𝑛, as 

𝑚𝑎𝑥 , ∆𝑉𝑦𝑤
𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛(∆𝑉𝑦𝑤,𝑋

∆𝑉𝑦𝑤

𝑚𝑎𝑥)                      (6)  

Let  ∆𝑉𝑡ℎ be the voltage threshold that determines whether or 
not a less-frequently occurred critical nodes should be included 
𝑚𝑖𝑛 < ∆𝑉𝑡ℎ, node 𝑦𝑤 will not be 
to the critical load list.  If ∆𝑉𝑦𝑤
considered in the final critical node set. Otherwise, it will.  

Note that voltage difference test is conducted to assess the 
voltage difference between a low-occurrence critical node and 
the high-occurrence critical nodes in the same IBR or VR zone. 
If  the  voltage  difference  is  minimal,  then  there  is  no  need  to 
include 𝑦 as a new critical node. This will significantly reduce 
the  number  of  critical  nodes  and  improve  the  computational 
speed in practice. 

As an illustration, assumer ∆𝑉𝑡ℎ = 0.001 𝑝. 𝑢.  and there are 
two  high-occurrence  critical  nodes  and  one  low-occurrence 
node (with only 4 occurrences). By the first rule, the two high-
occurrence  critical  nodes  are  considered  as  critical  nodes. 
Assume  that  the  voltage  differences  between  the  low-
occurrence node and the two critical nodes are  

0.0018
4.1 × 10−4 3.8 × 10−4 4.5 × 10−4 4.4 × 10−4]. 

0.0018           0.0017        0.0017

∆V1 =   [
Then, we have 

∆𝑉1,𝑋

𝑚𝑎𝑥 = [

∆𝑉1

𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 4.5 × 10−4 < ∆𝑉𝑡ℎ = 0.001 𝑝. 𝑢. 

Thus,  this  low-occurrence  node  will  not  be  considered  as  a

where 𝑣 is the index of the load node inside IBR zone 𝑘,  𝑚𝑘 is 
the total number of load nodes inside the IBR zone 𝑘, and  𝐾 is 
the total number of IBR zones.  

If  𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑙,𝑘 calculated for all 𝐾 zones are below the correlation 
threshold, 𝛼, a new IBR zone will be created. Otherwise, put 
node  𝑙  into  an  existing  IBR  zone  with  the  maximum 𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑙,𝑘. 
Because  FIC  groups  load  nodes  by  comparing   𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑙,𝑘  to 𝛼, 
increasing 𝛼 will increase the number of IBR zones. The FIC 
algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1.

    2)  IBR Zonal Control Mechanism 
In  real-time  operation,  at  time 𝑡,  voltage  measurements 
𝑽̂𝑘,𝑢(𝑡) (∀𝑢 ∈ 𝑈) at critical nodes in each IBR zone are sent to 
the IBR controller. If a voltage violation is detected in the 𝑘th 
IBR zone  (See point 1 in Fig. 7),  the 𝑘thIBR zone controller 
will identify the extreme critical node,𝑟, which is the node with 
the  highest  over-voltage,  or  the  node  with  the  lowest  under-
voltage. The extreme voltage violation, ∆𝑉𝑘,𝑟(𝑡) is calculated as   

∆𝑉𝑘,𝑟(𝑡) = {

where 𝑉1_𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑉1_𝑚𝑖𝑛 is the predetermined first-stage nodal 
voltage upper and lower limit, respectively.

Fig.7. IBR-based voltage correction process. 

To regulate the voltage at critical node 𝑟 in the 𝑘th IBR zone, 
a  distributed,  priority-list  based  zonal  IBR  control  scheme  is 
developed.  Let 𝑃𝐿𝑘 represent the priority list in the in 𝑘th IBR 
zone.   All  node 𝑣  in  IBR  zone  𝑘  will  be  assigned a  priority, 
𝑃𝐿𝑘,𝑣, which is calculated from 𝑐𝑣,𝑟  using (10) and ranked  in 
the  descending  order.  The  controller  dispatch  IBRs  starting 
from  the  top  of  the  priority  list  in  a  sequential  manner  until 
∆𝑄𝑘,𝑅𝑒𝑞(𝑡) is met or all IBR resources are depleted.  

To 

a  voltage 

avoid  voltage  oscillations, 

return 
band, [(𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛,1 + 𝜀𝑑) , (𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥,1 − 𝜀𝑢)], is defined, where 𝜀𝑢 and 
𝜀𝑑 are the two voltage return margins. If voltage at the extreme 
critical node returns to the idle zone (see point 2 in Fig. 7), the 
IBR controller will do nothing; if the voltage returns to the reset 
zone (see point 3 in Fig. 7), the IBR controller will return IBRs 
to the unity power factor mode based on the reversed priority 
list where (12) and (13) are used to calculate ∆𝑄𝑘,𝑅𝑒𝑞(𝑡). This 
will  let  the  IBRs  return  to  the  unity  power  factor  operation 
model based on the reversed priority list.  

Note that in this method, only voltages measurements at the 
critical nodes in an IBR zone are used as the inputs to the IBR 
controller,  while  for  the  method  introduced  in  [21],  voltage 
measurements from all nodes in the IBR zone are required.

generated  clusters  during  different  operation  conditions.  As 
shown in Fig. 9, load nodes on different phases (i.e., phase 𝑎, 
𝑏, and 𝑐) are clustered using multiple correlation thresholds 𝛼 
under 1000 different PV/load scenario.  

There  are  different  numbers  of  IBR  zones  on  different 
phases,  so  each  phase  needs  to  be  treated  separately.  FIC 
generated  a  stable  number  of  clusters  up  to 𝛼 ≤ 0.96.  When 
using 𝛼 ≥ 0.97 to cluster load nodes, the number of nodes in a 
cluster may vary for different operation conditions.  

This shows that the correlation between voltage and reactive 
power is consistent for nodes on the same phase under a wide 
range  of  operation  conditions  as  long  as  we  don’t  use  an 
extremely  high 𝛼.  In  this  paper,  we  choose  𝛼 = 0.96,  which 
results in one IBR zone in phase b and two IBR zones in phase 
a and c, respectively. The IBR zones are shown in Fig. 3(a).

where ∆𝑉 is a voltage margin. Also, let 𝑡 < 𝑇 so that the IBR 
control  will  be  implemented  in  a  faster  pace.  Those  settings 
allows  the  IBR  controllers  to  take  the  first-stage  actions  for 
correcting the local voltage excursions while the VR controllers 
will correct large, system-wise voltage deviations.  

IV.  SIMULATION RESULTS 

A  12.47  kV  three-phase  unbalanced  actual  distribution 
feeder  model  representing  a  real  circuit  located  in  North 
Carolina is selected to verify the effectiveness of the proposed 
methods. The topology  of the feeder is shown in Fig. 3. The 
feeder includes 1283 nodes, 370 of which are load nodes. The 
feeder load disaggregation algorithm presented in [20] has been 
used to allocate 1-min resolution residential load profiles from 
Pecan Street [24] to every load node on a test feeder. This step 
is important to give each load node a realistic individual load 
profile  and  will  prepare  the  nodal  load  profiles  for  running 
quasi-static  power  flow  simulations.  The  disaggregation 
algorithm  was  applied  to  the  distribution  feeder  and  it  has 
allocated 427 households aggregated to a substation load peak 
at  1.82  MW.  To  model  high-PV  penetration  scenarios,  each 
household has a 5 kW PV system connected to it summing to a 
total  2.135  MW  of  PV  installation.  It  is  assumed  that  each 
inverter is sized such that its total apparent power can reach up 
to 110% of its rated  active power capacity. Also, we assume 
that each PV system is equipped with a smart inverter that can 
inject and absorb reactive power. 

A.  IBR Zone Identification 
We  performed  FIC  at  multiple  randomly  sampled  PV  and 
nodal load profiles between 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. to observe 
the  voltage  sensitivity  correlations  effect  on  the  number  of 

(c)

(a) Phase a, (b) Phase b, and (c) Phase c. 

B.  Critical Nodes Selection 
Five  IBR  zones  (see  Fig.  3a)  were  identified  when 
setting 𝛼 = 0.96. The utility-owned assets include an OLTC at 
the  feeder  head,  one  three-phase  SVR  and  two  single-phase 
SVRs,  resulting  in  four  VR  zones  (see  Fig.  3b).  The 
OLTC/SVR are all single-phase auto-transformers. 

Run Monte Carlo simulation for 10,000 between 9:00 a.m. 
and 8:00 p.m. (see Fig. 5) and set 𝑇𝐻 = 5% and 𝑉𝑡ℎ = 0.001 
p.u.. The numbers of critical nodes identified for the IBR and 
VR zones are presented in Table I and Table II, respectively. 

A sensitivity study is performed to quantify the impact of the 
number of Monte Carlo run on the number of identified critical 
nodes.  As  shown  in  Fig.  10,  the  total  number  of  identified 
critical nodes for the IBR and VR zones stabilized after 30,000 
run. Because the VR control zones overlap with the IBR zones 
(see Fig. 3), the critical nodes in the IBR zones are a subset of 
the critical nodes in the VR zones. If we count non-overlapping 
critical nodes in both the IBR and VR zones together, there are 
51 critical nodes identified, representing 3.9% of the nodes on 
this feeder. In many cases, infrequently-occurred critical nodes 
can  be  replaced  by  frequently-occurred  critical  nodes.  
Therefore,  performing  a  voltage  difference  check  can 
significantly reduce the number of critical nodes.

larger ∆𝑉, we shift more voltage regulation tasks from the VR 
devices to the IBRs so that voltage fluctuations are mainly taken 
care of by the local IBR devices.  

Figure 11(b) shows that voltages at all nodes on the feeder 
are  maintained  within  the  ANSI  limits.  Note  that  this  is 
achieved by monitoring only the voltages at the critical nodes.  
Also,  the  proposed  first-stage  control  (i.e.  reactive  power 
compensation from IBRs) is capable of estimating the required 
reactive power support from PV smart inverters when voltage 
violations  exist  and  reset  the  smart  inverters  back  to  unity 
power factor when the voltages return within proper limits, as 
shown in Fig. 12. The total reactive power contribution by each 
IBR zone inverters for a winter month is shown in Fig. 13(a).  
Note that in (13), the voltage-reactive power sensitivity, 𝑞𝑟,𝑟, 
at critical node 𝑟 is used to estimate the reactive power required 
from each IBR. In general, the voltage sensitivities vary when 
the feeder is reconfigured or the nodal load pattern changes. For 
the  feeder  used  in  this  simulation,  the  voltage  sensitivity 
variations between a winter day (low load and high PV) and a 
summer day (high load and high PV) are typically within 5%. 
In  practice,  we  recommend  that  the  voltage  sensitivities  be 
calculated offline to account for seasonality load changes and 
feeder reconfiguration events.

In the base case, only the utility-owned VR devices are used 
and  all  OLTC/SVR  are  operating  under  local  control  with 
𝑉𝑠𝑒𝑡 =123 V, 𝐷𝐵 = 4 V, and time delays between 30 s to 60 s. 
In  the  coordinative  voltage  control  cases,  set  𝑉2_𝑚𝑎𝑥 =
1.049 𝑝. 𝑢. and 𝑉2_𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 0.96 𝑝. 𝑢. so the zonal voltage will be 
controlled  to  be  within  the  ANSI  limits.  Let  the  IBRs  adjust 
reactive power output every one minute (i.e.,  𝑡 = 1) with 𝜀𝑢 =
0.001 𝑝. 𝑢.  [21]  and  let  VR  devices  adjust  their  voltage 
setpoints  every  two  minutes  (i.e., 𝑇 = 2)  with  𝐷𝐵 = 4V.  Set 
the  time  delays  of  VR  devices  as: 𝑇𝐷𝑂𝐿𝑇𝐶 = 75 s, 𝑇𝐷𝑆𝑉𝑅2 =
𝑇𝐷𝑆𝑉𝑅3 = 90 s,  𝑇𝐷𝑆𝑉𝑅4 = 105 s.   To evaluate the impact of 
∆𝑉 (voltage margin introduced in (17)) on voltage coordination 
between the VR device and IBRs, we tested four ∆𝑉 settings: 0, 
0.002, 0.004, and 0.006 V. 

The  results  of  a  winter  month,  where  voltage  regulations 
have been frequently observed, are presented to demonstrate the 
performance  of  the  proposed  algorithm.  The  simulation  time 
step  is  1  minute.  As  shown  in  Table  III,  if  the  IBRs  do  not 
provide voltage regulation, although the voltage regulators act 
frequently, voltage violations still persist. This can also be seen 
in the voltage profile shown in Fig. 11 (a).   

The  results  in  Table  III  also  show  that  a  larger  ∆𝑉  can 
significantly  reduce  the  tap  changes  but  increase  the  reactive 
power  outputs  of  the  IBRs.  This  is  because  by  setting  up  a

As shown in Figs. 14 and 13(b), the number of tap changes 
is reduced significantly. This demonstrates the effectiveness of 
the  IBR  and  VR  coordination  scheme  as  well  as  the  online 
voltage setpoint tuning method.

V.  CONCLUSION      

In  conclusion,  the  proposed  two-stage,  zonal  Volt/VAR 
control scheme  for  coordinating  IBRs  with utility-owned  VR 
devices can effectively reduce the number of tap changes of the 
VR  devices  while  maintaining  nodal  voltages  within  the 
operation  limit.  Because  the  IBR  and  VR  control  zones  are 
partitioned  based  on 
the  nodal  voltage-reactive  power 
sensitivities  per  each  phase,  the  unbalanced  loads  can  be 
accounted for when regulating voltages. Coordination between 
IBRs and VR devices can be successfully achieved by selecting 
different  voltage  control  targets  and  letting  the  IBR  control 
execute  at  a  smaller  time  interval  than  the  VR  control. 
Simulation results demonstrated that this enables IBRs to react 
to  very  fast,  small  voltage  fluctuations  while  letting  the  VRs 
correct  persistent,  larger  voltage  deviations.  Finally,  the 
proposed  online  voltage 
tuning  mechanism 
significantly reduced the number of tap changes. The algorithm 
uses  real-time  voltage  measurements  from  only  the  critical 
nodes  (less  than  3.9%  of  total  nodes)  and  requires  neither 
optimization nor the feeder model, making the computing time 
negligible  with  minimal  sensing  and  communication  needs. 
Thus, the algorithm can be deployed on grid edge computation 
platforms without retrofitting the existing VR devices.
