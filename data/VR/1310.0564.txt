High–latitude supergiant V5112 Sgr: enrichment
of the envelope with heavy s-process metals

Abstract High–resolution (R = 60 000) echelle spectroscopy of the post–AGB super-
giant V5112 Sgr performed in 1996–2012 with the 6-meter telescope BTA has revealed
peculiarities of the star optical spectrum and has allowed the variability of the velocity
ﬁeld in the stellar atmosphere and envelope to be studied in detail. An asymmetry
and splitting of strong absorption lines with a low lower–level excitation potential have
been detected for the ﬁrst time. The eﬀect is maximal in Ba II lines whose proﬁle is
split into three components. The proﬁle shape and positions of the split lines change
with time. The blue components of the split absorption lines are shown to be formed
in a structured circumstellar envelope, suggesting an eﬃcient dredge–up of the heavy
metals produced during the preceding evolution of this star into the envelope. The
envelope expansion velocities have been estimated to be Vexp ≈ 20 and 30 km/s. The
mean radial velocity from diﬀuse bands in the spectrum of V5112 Sgr coincides with
that from the short–wavelength shell component of the Na I D lines, which leads to the
conclusion about their formation in the circumstellar envelope. Analysis of the set of
radial velocities Vr based on symmetric absorption lines has conﬁrmed the presence of
pulsations in the stellar atmosphere with an amplitude ∆V r ≤ 8 km/s.
Keywords: stellar evolution, post-AGB stars, envelopes, spectra.

1. Introduction
The high-latitude supergiant V5112 Sgr with Galactic coordinates l = 23.o98, b =−21.o0 and
spectral type Sp = F2–F6 (Parthasarathy et al. 1988), identiﬁed with the strong infrared
source IRAS 19500−1709, belongs to semiregular variable post-asymptotic giant branch
(post–AGB) stars. Intermediate mass stars (their initial masses are 3–8M⊙) that evolve
from the AGB, losing their matter through a stellar wind, are observed at this short stage.
The secular variability of the main parameters observed in post–AGB stars stimulates their
spectroscopic monitoring. A spectroscopic monitoring of selected AGB and post–AGB stars
has been performed with the 6-meter telescope BTA over the last decade. The main goal
of the monitoring program is to reveal a peculiarity and probable variability of the spec-
trum and to study the temporal behavior of the velocity ﬁeld in the extended atmosphere
and envelope of peculiar supergiants. By now, based on observational data from the 6–m
telescope, we have found spectroscopic variability in V510 Pup (Klochkova and Chentsov
2004), BD+48o1220 (Klochkova et al. 2007a), V2324 Cyg (Klochkova et al. 2008a) and the

optical counterparts of the infrared sources IRAS 01005+7910 (Klochkova et al. 2002) and
IRAS 20508+2011 (Klochkova et al. 2006).

Original results concerning the variability of the optical spectrum and the velocity ﬁeld
in the atmospheres have also been obtained for the variable stars CY CMi (Klochkova
1995; Klochkova et al. 2007b), QY Sge (Klochkova et al. 2007c), V354 Lac (Klochkova 2009;
Klochkova et al. 2009), and V448 Lac (Klochkova et al. 2010). The BTA spectroscopy for
post–AGB stars is presented in more detail in our review (Klochkova 2012). Recently,
Klochkova and Panchuk (2012) published the results of their spectroscopic monitoring for
the high–latitude supergiant LN Hya whose observations revealed a peculiarity and variabil-
ity of the proﬁles of strong Fe I, Fe II, Ba II, Si II, and other lines. Weak emissions of neutral
atoms (VI, MnI, CoI, NiI, FeI) appeared in the June 1, 2010 spectrum. These features of the
stellar spectrum detected for the ﬁrst time suggest that the physical conditions in the upper
atmospheric layers of LN Hya changed rapidly in 2010.

This paper is devoted to a detailed study of the optical spectrum for V5112 Sgr. The study
of its photometric variability has a fairly long history (Arkhipova et al. 2010; Hrivnak et al.
2011). However, as yet no deﬁnitive conclusions about the causes, type, and parameters of
the photometric variability have been reached. The cyclic variability amplitude of V5112 Sgr
is low; it does not exceed ∆V ≤ 0.2m in V and changes with time. As regards the variability
period, it has been determined incompletely: as Hrivnak et al. (2010) showed, the dominant
period is 38d in V.

A peculiarity of the infrared spectrum for IRAS 19500−1709 is the presence of a peculiar
emission feature at 21 µ (Kwok et al. 1999). The small group of objects with the as yet
unidentiﬁed 21 µ emission feature includes post–AGB stars with an atmospheric chemical
composition changed in the course of their own evolution. A generalization of the results
of several publications appeared in the late 1990’s (Klochkova 1995; van Winckel et al.
1996; Reddy et al. 1997; van Winckel 1997) led Klochkova (1997) and Decin et al. (1998)
to conclude that the atmospheric chemical composition of all post–AGB stars with the 21 µ
emission feature changed through the dredge-up of carbon and heavy metals synthesized
through the s–process. Subsequent studies of an extended sample of objects conﬁrmed this
conclusion. At present, about a dozen post–AGB stars with the 21 µ emission feature have
been studied in our Galaxy. Their main list is contained in Hrivnak et al. (2010), a paper
devoted to investigating the photometric variability of this type of stars.

IRAS 19500−1709 is the highest-latitude object in the group of sources with the 21 µ band.
The location of V5112 Sgr at a high Galactic latitude already suggests that it belongs to an
old population of the Galaxy. Its low metallicity (van Winckel et al. 1996) conﬁrms this
classiﬁcation. The atmospheric chemical composition of the star studied in detail by these
authors is typical of post–AGB stars with the 21 µ band: the atmospheres of these stars
exhibit large overabundances of carbon and s–process elements synthesized during their
preceding evolutionary stages. As follows from Table 11 in van Winckel (1997), V5112 Sgr is
the record–holder in the overabundances of carbon and s–process elements in the atmosphere.

The circumstellar envelope of V5112 Sgr is also enriched with carbon and is a CO emission
source (van der Veen et al. 1993). The ﬂux emitted by the circumstellar envelope in IRAS
bands is comparable to the visible ﬂux from this star (Hrivnak et al. 1989). Note that the
infrared ﬂux from most of the highlatitude F supergiants is low. In particular, no infrared
excess whatsoever was detected in the prototype star, the supergiant UU Her. The super-
giant LN Hya, the optical spectrum peculiarities and the velocity ﬁeld variability in whose

Klochkova: High–latitude supergiant V5112 Sgr

atmosphere were studied by Klochkova and Panchuk (2012), is also a member of this small
Galactic population (Sasselov 1984).

As can be seen from the above references, several papers devoted to investigating the
chemical peculiarities of V5112 Sgr have been published in the last 20 years, while there
is virtually no information about the peculiarities of its optical spectrum and its behavior
with time. To make up for this deﬁciency, we took new high–quality optical spectra for
V5112 Sgr in 1996–2012. Analysis of this observational material provided previously unknown
information concerning the variability and peculiarities of the star optical spectrum and the
detailed picture of radial velocities Vr in its atmosphere and envelope. In this paper, we
brieﬂy describe the methods of spectroscopic observations and spectrum processing as well
as present and discuss our results.

2. Observations, processing and analysis of spectra

We obtained spectroscopic data for V5112 Sgr at the Nasmyth focus of the 6-m BTA telescope
at the Special Astrophysical Observatory with the NES echelle spectrograph designed by
Panchuk et al. (2007, 2009). The observations were performed with a 2048×2048–pixel CCD
array and an image slicer (Panchuk et al. 2009). The observations on August 2, 2012, were
carried out with a larger 2048×4096–pixel CCD, which provided a considerable increase in
the recorded spectral range. The spectral resolution is λ/∆λ ≥ 60000; the signal-to-noise
ratio is S/N≥100. The mean dates of observations (JD) and the recorded spectral range are
given in Table 1.

One–dimensional spectra were extracted from two–dimensional echelle frames using the
ECHELLE context of the MIDAS software package modiﬁed by Yushkin and Klochkova
(2005) by taking into account the peculiarities of the NES optical scheme. Cosmic-ray hits
were removed by a median averaging of two spectra taken successively one after another. The
wavelength calibration was made with a hollow–cathode ThAr lamp. The extracted spectro-
scopic data were processed with the DECH20t software package developed by Galazutdinov
(1992). Telluric [O I], O2, and H2O lines were used to check the instrumental reconciliation
of the spectra for the star and the hollow–cathode lamp. The procedure for measuring the
heliocentric radial velocity Vr from the NES spectra and the sources of errors are described
in more detail in Klochkova et al. (2008b) and Klochkova and Tavolzhanskaya (2010). The
rms measurement error of Vr for stars with narrow absorption lines in the spectrum is ≤1.0
km/s (the accuracy from a single line).

3. Main results

In this section, we describe the main anomalies and variability of the line proﬁles as well as
the related peculiarities in the behavior of the velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere and envelope
of V5112 Sgr.

The overwhelming majority of absorption features in the stellar spectrum with low and
moderate intensities have symmetric proﬁles without any anomalies. It is these numerous
features that we used to study the behavior of the star radial velocities with time. Having
analyzed our sets of Vr based on symmetric absorption lines, we concluded that there is
no correlation between the line intensity and the corresponding Vr. This allowed us to con-
sider the averaged radial velocities for each spectrum in the subsequent analysis. The mean
velocity Vr(metals) reliably determined from numerous symmetric absorption lines is given

in column 4 of Table 1. As follows from this table, Vr(metals) changes from date to date
with a small amplitude ≤ 8 km/s relative to the systemic velocity Vsys = 13 km/s obtained
by Bujarrabal et al. (1992) and van der Veen (1993) from CO molecular lines. Obviously,
this radial velocity variability with a small amplitude is attributable to the stellar pulsations
studied in detail by Hrivnak et al. (2011). Based on a large set of measurements, these au-
thors concluded that the radial velocity of V5112 Sgr changes only slightly near its mean
Vr≈14 km/s, which is very close to the systemic velocity Vsys = 13 km/s.

The Hα proﬁle. Emission components in the Hα proﬁle are typical of post-AGB stars
(see examples in Fig. 2 from Klochkova (1997)) and are among the main criteria for selecting
such objects (Kwok 1993). As follows from Fig. 1, the Hα proﬁle contains emission compo-
nents in all our spectra for V5112 Sgr. An Hα proﬁle with a double–peaked emission feature
typical of post–AGB stars was recorded in 2010 and 2012. Having analyzed a large volume
of spectroscopic observations for post–AGB stars near the Hα line, Sanchez Contreras et al.
(2008) classiﬁed the proﬁles of these stars. Using their classication, we attribute the Hα pro-
ﬁle in the spectrum of V5112 Sgr in quiescent phases to the EFA (emission–ﬁlled absorption)
type. According to universally accepted views, this proﬁle type points to the existence of a
long–lived circumstellar gas reservoir. The line width is determined primarily by the eﬀect
of scattering by free electrons and by the kinematics of the circumstellar structure.

Note the abrupt change of the Hα proﬁle type in the spectrum of V5112 Sgr that occurred
at the turn of the new century: in 1996, we recorded a proﬁle inverse to the P Cyg one, while
in the 2000s, as follows from Fig. 1, the proﬁle contained already two emission components.
We emphasize that this change of the Hα proﬁle type that we detected occurred concurrently
with a signiﬁcant change in the object photometric characteristics found by Hrivnak et al.
(2010) during a long–term monitoring.

The radial velocity derived from the absorption components of neutral hydrogen lines
changes with time (Fig. 1). However, the small number of measurements (from one to four
for diﬀerent H I lines) did not allow us to reveal any regular patterns in the behavior of
Vr(H I).

indicates the systemic velocity Vsys = 13 km/s.

Strong absorption lines. Analyzing our highquality spectra of V5112 Sgr taken in a
wide wavelength range, apart from the variable Hα proﬁle, we revealed other, previously
unknown, peculiarities of the spectrum.

First, we found the strongest absorption lines of metals (Si II, Ba II, Y II, Zr II) originating
in the star high atmospheric layers to have anomalous proﬁles: asymmetric with an extended
blue wing or split into individual components. As an example, Fig. 2 presents fragments of the
spectra with BaII 4554 and BaII 4934 ˚A lines in the August 2, 2012 and July 7, 2001 spectra,
respectively. Anomalous split proﬁles of the resonance lines for various chemical elements
are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. A diﬀerent width of the components is clearly seen here: for the
long–wavelength component, it is approximately twice the width of the short–wavelength
ones shifted considerably relative to the systemic velocity. This diﬀerence in widths suggests
that the long–wavelength and blueshifted components are formed under diﬀerent physical
conditions. Note line splitting can also be seen in that Ba II 4934 ˚A the fragment of the
spectrum for V5112 Sgr from van Winckel (1997).

It should be emphasized that proﬁle anomalies were detected only for the absorption lines
of those metals for which large overabundances were detected in the stellar atmosphere. At
the same time, the proﬁles of even the strongest absorption lines of ironpeak elements have

no anomalies. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 2 from our comparison of the Ba II and Fe II
lines with similar intensities.

Second, comparison of the line proﬁles in the spectra of V5112 Sgr taken on diﬀerent nights
revealed signiﬁcant variability of the proﬁle shape and positions of the split–line components.
To illustrate the variability eﬀect, Fig. 3 presents the proﬁles of two Ba II lines with the most
prominent proﬁle asymmetry and variability for several dates of observations.

Consider in more detail the picture of radial velocities based on the components of split
absorption lines. Table 2 presents Vr for the individual components of the Ba II lines for
four dates of observations. As follows from our comparison of the data from the last two
columns of this table, the positions of the long–wavelength components of the Ba II lines
change synchronously with those of the symmetric absorptions. Thus, we have reason to
believe that the red component of the Ba II lines is formed in the stellar atmosphere. The
position of the blue component itself changes only slightly with time, deviating from the
mean Vr ≈ −16.2 km/s by ±0.6 km/s. Thus, given the systemic velocity Vsys = 13 km/s, we
ﬁnd that the short–wavelength component of the Ba II lines (and other split absorption lines)
is formed in layers expanding with a velocity Vexp(1) ≈ 30 km/s.

dates: August 2, 2012 (thin solid and (b) line), June 13, 2011 (thick solid line), August 14,
2006 (dotted line), and July 7, 2001 (dashed line): left – Ba II 4554 ˚A, right – the Ba II 4934 ˚A.

Here, it is important to note that a similar expansion velocity, Vexp ≈ 30–40 km/s, was
found by Bujarrabal et al. (1992) based on the recording of the CO emission proﬁles in the
millimeter spectrum of IRAS 19500−1709 associated with the star V5112 Sgr. Bujarrabal
et al. (1992, 2001) emphasize that the proﬁles of the CO bands for IRAS 19500−1709 are
two–components ones: a central narrow emission component originating in a medium with
a low (about 10 km/s) expansion velocity is superimposed on a high–velocity component. In
our optical spectra, the split absorption line proles also exhibit a second component located
between the short–wavelength and atmospheric ones: for the Ba II lines, the velocity corre-
sponding to the position of the middle component is, on average, Vr ≈ −7.1 km/s. Thus, we
obtain the following estimate for the expansion velocity of the layers in which this component
is formed: Vexp(2) ≈ 20 km/s.

The Na I resonance doublet was detected for four dates of observations. As follows
from Fig. 5 and the data from columns 5 and 6 of Table 1, the doublet D line proﬁle is
complex. Two components are reliably identiﬁed at our spectral resolution. The position of
the long–wavelength component of the Na I D lines changes with time, being in agreement
with the positions of the symmetric metal absorptions originating in the stellar atmosphere
for each date. In contrast, the position of the short–wavelength component of the Na I D lines
is essentially constant with time. The mean velocity determined from the short–wavelength
component is Vr−9.0 km/s, which is close to the position of the middle component in the split
Ba II lines. Obviously, this stable short–wavelength component of the Na I D lines is formed
in the circumstellar envelope, because we cannot expect the presence of interstellar Na I lines
in the spectrum of a star so far away from the Galactic plane. Bartkevicius (1992) gives the

color excess E(B−V) = 0.10m in the catalog of UU Her stars. The multiband photometry of
V5112 Sgr performed by Hrivnak et al. (1989) is also indicative of a low reddening.

A complex proﬁle that also contained the circumstellar component, in addition to the
photospheric and interstellar ones, in the spectra of post–AGB stars with envelopes was
previously observed only for the D lines of the Na I doublet. In particular, this is also true
for the star V354 Lac, in the spectrum of which the circumstellar component of the Na I
D lines was identiﬁed by Reddy et al. (2002). The proﬁle of the Na I D lines and other
peculiarities of the spectrum for this star were studied in more detail by Klochkova (2009)
and Klochkova et al. (2009) based on BTA spectra. The circumstellar absorption components
of the Na I D lines were also identiﬁed in the spectrum of HD 56126 that was well studied
by Bakker et al. (1997), Klochkova et al. (2007b), and Klochkova and Chentsov (2007). In
addition, the cases of a manifestation of the circumstellar gaseous–dusty envelope in the form
of emission components of the Na I D lines are known. As an example, we provide spectra
for the star V510 Pup identiﬁed with the infrared source IRAS 08005−2356 (Klochkova and
Chentsov 2004), the bipolar nebula AFGL 2688 (Klochkova et al. 2004), and the semiregular
variable QY Sge = IRAS 20056+1834 (Kameswara Rao et al. 2002; Klochkova et al. 2007c).
We emphasize also that weak absorption features identiﬁed with the so–called diﬀuse bands
(DBs) well known in the spectroscopy of the interstellar medium are present in the optical
spectrum of V5112 Sgr. As an illustration, Fig. 5 presents the proﬁles in “intensity–radial
velocity” coordinates for one of the bands at 6195.96 ˚A in two spectra. The choice of this
band is dictated by the fact that it is narrow and least blended in the spectra of F– and
G–supergiants. Because of the large intensity diﬀerence between the absorption features, the
scales of the vertical axes diﬀer approximately by a factor of 10. This ﬁgure suggests that

the positions of the circumstellar component of the Na I D2 line and the 6195.96 ˚A band
coincide.

In the the wavelength range 5780–6613 ˚A, we measured Vr(DB) from the positions of the
reliably identiﬁed 5780, 5797, 6196, 6234, and 6379 ˚A features. We took the exact wave-
lengths of these bands from the list by Hobbs et al. (2008). In the August 2, 2012 spectrum,
the equivalent widths of these features are W = 83, 40, 30, 8, and 18 ˚A, respectively. The
inaccuracy of the mean velocity determined in the spectra of V5112 Sgr is ≤ ±0.5 km/s. As
follows from the last row in Table 1, the mean (over the spectra) Vr(DB) = −8.9 km/s is in
excellent agreement with the velocity derived from the short–wavelength component of the
Na I D lines.

The derived coincidence suggests that the weak diﬀuse bands we detected originate in
the circumstellar envelope. This fact is not so trivial as it may seem, because after the
publication of the results by Luna et al. (2008), it has been widely believed that the diﬀuse
bands originate only in the interstellar medium; the physical conditions in the circumstellar
envelopes of post–AGB stars are not conducive to their formation. Luna et al. (2008) reached
this conclusion by studying high–resolution spectra for a sample of post–AGB stars. We
compared our measurements of W and Vr with the data of these authors for V5112 Sgr
and point out satisfactory agreement in W. However, the measurements of Vr for V5112 Sgr
from Luna et al. (2008) have a low accuracy due to the inclusion of the wide band at 6284 ˚A,

located in the blue wing of a very strong Y II absorption line in the spectrum of V5112 Sgr.
Yttrium has a large overabundance in the stellar atmosphere: according to van Winckel
(1997), [s/Fe] = +1.3. Therefore, the 6613.7 ˚A line proﬁle has anomalies typical of the strong
absorption lines of heavy metals in the spectrum of V5112 Sgr.

4. DISCUSSION

As we have pointed out above, an optical manifestation of circumstellar envelopes has been
found previously in the D lines of the Na I doublet. The results of observations of the circum-
stellar envelopes around Mira–type stars in the K I 7665 and 7669 ˚A lines are also known (see
Guilain and Mauron (1996) and references therein). Based on high–resolution spectra, apart
from Na I and K I, Mauron and Huggins (2010) also detected other metals in the gas phase
in the Mira–type star CW Leo (the infrared source IRC +10216), which has an extremely
extended structured envelope with an angular size of about 200 arcsec: Ca I, Ca II, and Fe I.
In this work, we have detected a manifestation of the envelope in lines of heavy metals
in the spectrum of a star at a later evolutionary stage for the ﬁrst time. The main new
result of our study is the detection of a multicomponent Ba II line proﬁle and an asym-
metry of the low–excitation absorption lines for a number of other metals in the spectrum
of V5112 Sgr. Previously, we found a distortion of the proﬁles of the strongest absorption
lines for three more post–AGB stars with similar parameters: CY CMi = IRAS 07134+1005,
V354 Lac = 22274+5435, and V448 Lac = 22223+4327.

Table 3 gives basic properties for these related post–AGB stars. In addition to the common
signatures of protoplanetary nebulae (PPN) formulated by Kwok (1993), a further study of
these stars and associated infrared sources revealed a number of important properties. In

particular, an emission feature at λ = 21µ was detected in the infrared spectra of all four
objects being compared. The 21 µ band was ﬁrst detected in the infrared spectra of four
PPNs by Kwok et al. (1989); a decade later, the same authors (Kwok et al. 1999) published
a list of already a dozen PPN, among which there are also the four stars from Table 3. Based
on high–spatial–resolution Hubble space telescope snapshots, Sahai et al. (2007) and Ueta
et al. (2000, 2008) concluded that the envelopes of these four stars have diﬀerent aspherical
morphologies (see column 4 in Table 3). The last two columns in this table give the expansion
velocity Vexp of the circumstellar envelope from millimeter (column 5) and optical (column
6) observations.

Among the objects listed in Table 3, the semiregular variable V354 Lac (spectral type
G5 Iap, as inferred by Hrivnak (1995)) is closely analogous to V5112 Sgr in envelope struc-
ture and spectrum peculiarities. The spectroscopic monitoring of this star performed by
Klochkova et al. (2009) at the 6-m BTA telescope with resolution R = 60000 revealed a split-
ting of the strongest absorption lines with a lower–level excitation potential χlow < 1 eV.
Analysis of the kinematics showed that the short–wavelength component of the split line
is formed in the star extended gas–dust envelope. This splitting is most clearly seen in the
proﬁle of the Ba II 6141 ˚A line with an equivalent width W≈1 ˚A. The Doppler separation
between the absorption components of this line is about 35 km/s. The position of the short–
wavelength component of Ba II coincides with the position of the circumstellar component in
the proﬁle of the Na I D-lines, which is formed in the same layers where the Swan C2 molec-
ular bands are also formed. This coincidence suggests that, apart from the atmospheric
component, the complex Ba II 6141 ˚A line proﬁle contains the component originating in the
circumstellar envelope. Such a splitting (or asymmetry of the proﬁle because of the ﬂatter
blue wing) is also observed for other Ba II lines (λ 4554, 5853, and 6496 A) as well as for
the strong La II 6390 ˚A, Nd II 5234 ˚A, 5293 ˚A, Y II 5402 ˚A, lines. In the spectrum of V354 Lac,
the lines of these heavy–element ions are enhanced to an extent that their intensities are
comparable to those of the neutral hydrogen lines.

Based on BTA spectra, Klochkova et al. (2007b) and Klochkova et al. (2010) found pecu-
liarities and variability of the optical spectra for two other stars from Table 3, CY CMi and
V448 Lac, respectively. The proﬁles of the strongest metal absorption lines in the spectrum
of these two stars are asymmetric. All lines, except the hydrogen ones, have the same type
of asymmetry: the blue wing is more extended than the red one, i.e., the radial velocity
measured from the upper part of the proﬁle (from the wings) turns out to be lower than that
measured from the core. The blueshift of the wings relative to the core increases as the line
strengthens, gradually or abruptly. In addition, we see from our comparison of the spectra
taken at diﬀerent dates that the proﬁle shape of these lines originating in the star expanding
atmosphere (at the base of the wind) changes both with time and with line intensity. We
emphasize that no clear splitting into components has been found in the collection of BTA
echelle spectra for CY CMi and V448 Lac even for the most intense absorption lines. The
expansion velocity was measured with a high accuracy for both stars from several tens of
rotational lines of the Swan C2 molecular bands and it was concluded that the molecular
envelope expansion is stable.

Note that a probable splitting of the absorption lines into components with diﬀerent
positions and intensities for diﬀerent dates of observations must not be ruled out a priori.
Observations with an ultra–high spectral resolution are needed to test this assumption.

The diﬀerence in proﬁle peculiarity type for two pairs of stars, V5112 Sgr and V354 Lac
with split proﬁles of the strongest absorption lines of selected elements as well as CY CMi

12

Klochkova: High–latitude supergiant V5112 Sgr

and V448 Lac with asymmetric but unsplit proﬁles, suggests that a complex morphology of
the circumstellar envelope could be a factor causing the proﬁle peculiarity and variability
for strong lines. We see from the data in Table 3 that the envelope for the pair of V5112 Sgr
and V354 Lac with split absorption lines is bipolar, while for CY CMi and V448 Lac there
is no splitting and the extended envelopes have a less distinct structure. The validity of
this assumption is also conﬁrmed by the fact that in the spectrum of V5112 Sgr, for which
Bujarrabal et al. (1992) detected slow (Vexp = 10 km/s) and fast (30–40 km/s) expansion
based on CO bands, we see a three–component proﬁle structure for strong absorption lines.
The split line proﬁles include the photospheric and two shell components, one of which,
by analogy with the CO proﬁle, originates in the envelope formed at the AGB stage and
expanding with a velocity Vexp(2) ≈ 20 km/s and the other originates in the envelope with
an expansion velocity Vexp(1) ≈ 30 km/s formed later.

At present, there are no universally accepted views of the formation of deviations from
spherical symmetry for PPN. An asymmetry (in particular, bipolarity) of the structures in
selected PPN was detected in several types of observations. Having investigated the po-
larization of the near–infrared emission for a sample of extended nebulae, Gledhill et al.
(2001) identiﬁed three diﬀerent shapes of these objects: isotropic, bipolar, and nebulae with
a dominant core. IRAS 19500−1709 in polarized light is a typical bipolar nebula with two
lobes and a dust lane. Having analyzed high–spatial–resolution HST optical images for a
sample of PPN, Ueta et al. (2000, 2008) concluded that the optical thickness of the circum-
stellar matter is a decisive factor in the formation of a particular type of stellar envelope
morphology.

A brief overview of the physical mechanisms for the formation of these complex structures
can be found, for example, in Lagadec et al. (2011). As a rule, it is assumed that the dense
spherical envelope formed at the AGB stage expands with a low velocity, while the axisym-
metric part of the envelope formed later, at the post–AGB stage, undergoes fast expansion.
The sequence of these processes gives rise to a gradient of the optical thickness in the direc-
tion from the equator to the polar axis of the system. The existence of a companion in the
system and/or the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld can also be the physical factors due to which
the spherical symmetry of the stellar envelope is lost in the short interval of evolution be-
tween AGB and post–AGB (see Huggins et al. 2009; Leal–Ferreira et al. 2012; and references
therein). Recently, Koning et al. (2013) proposed a simple PPN model that was constructed
based on a pair of evacuated cavities inside a dense spherical halo. The authors showed that
all of the morphological peculiarities observed in real bipolar PPNs could be reproduced by
varying parameters (the matter density in the cavity, its size and orientation).

As Sahai et al. (2007) pointed out, the diﬀerence in the shape of “extended halo” and
“bipolar” nebulae could be purely visual, because the observed shape depends strongly on
the inclination of the axis to the line of sight and on the angular resolution of the structure.
For instance, according to Nakashima et al. (2009), the extended envelope of CY CMi has
no clear structure in the form of jets, cavities, etc.

In future, it is especially important to study with a high resolution (R ≥ 60000) the optical
spectra of other related stars from the sample of objects with the 21 µ emission feature with
atmospheres enriched with heavy s–process metals. In particular, this also applies to the faint
stars with carbon enriched envelopes identiﬁed with the infrared sources IRAS 04296+3429
and 23304+6147. According to the data by Klochkova et al. (1999, 2000), the atmospheres of
the central stars of both sources are enriched with carbon and heavy metals, while according

Klochkova: High–latitude supergiant V5112 Sgr

13

to the observations by Sahai et al. (2007), the envelope of IRAS 04296+3429 has a bipolar
shape and the envelope of IRAS 23304+6147 probably has a quadrupole shape.

5. Conclusions

Based on our high–resolution echelle spectra of the post–AGB supergiant V5112 Sgr taken
in 1996–2012 at the 6–m BTA telescope, we detected peculiarities and variability of the
spectrum and the velocity ﬁeld in the stellar atmosphere and envelope. An asymmetry and
splitting of strong metal absorption lines, which is maximal for the Ba II lines whose proﬁle
is split into three components, have been found for this star for the ﬁrst time. The proﬁle
shape of the split lines and their positions are variable in time.

We determined two envelope expansion velocities Vexp ≈ 20 and 30 km/s consistent with
the picture of envelope expansion from millimeter observations. The coincidence of Vr deter-
mined from the short–wavelength components of the split absorption lines with the velocities
derived from CO molecular bands and the short–wavelength component of the Na I D lines
suggests that the short–wavelength components of the heavy–metal lines are formed in a
structured circumstellar envelope. Thus, evidence for an eﬃcient dredge–up of the heavy
metals produced during the stars preceding evolution into the envelope has been obtained
for the ﬁrst time.

Analysis of the set of radial velocities Vr inferred from symmetric absorption lines con-
ﬁrmed the presence of pulsations in the stellar atmosphere with a pulsation amplitude
∆Vr≤ 8 km/s.

The mean (from three spectra) radial velocity determined from diﬀuse bands in the spec-
trum of V5112 Sgr agrees excellently with the velocity derived from the short–wavelength
shell component of the Na I D lines. This leads us to conclude that the diﬀuse bands are
formed in the circumstellar envelope.
