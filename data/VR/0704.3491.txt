Abstract

We report the serendipitous ﬁndings of 13 faint meteors and 44 artiﬁcial space objects by Subaru
SuprimeCam imaging observations during 11–16 August 2004. The meteors, at about 100km altitude, and
artiﬁcial satellites/debris in orbit, at 500km altitude or higher, were clearly discriminated by their apparent
defocused image sizes.

CCD photometry of the 13 meteors, including 1 Perseid, 1 Aquarid, and 11 sporadic meteors, was
performed. We deﬁned a peak video-rate magnitude by comparing the integrated photon counts from the
brightest portion of the track traversed within 33 milliseconds (ms) to those from a 0-mag star during the
same time duration. This deﬁnition gives magnitudes in the range 4.0 < Vvr < 6.4 and 4.1 < Ivr < 5.9 for
these 13 meteors. The corresponding magnitude for virtual naked-eye observers could be somewhat fainter
especially for the V-band observation, in which the [OI] 5577 line lasting about 1 sec as an afterglow could
contribute to the integrated ﬂux of the present 5–10 min CCD exposures.

Although the spatial resolution is insuﬃcient to resolve the source size of anything smaller than about 1
m, we developed a new estimate of the collisionally excited column diameter of these meteors. A diameter
as small as a few mm was derived from their collisionally excited photon rates, meteor speed, and the
volume density of the oxygen atoms at the 100km altitude. The actual column diameter of the radiating
zone, however, could be as large as few 100m because the excited atoms travel that distance before they
emit forbidden lines in 0.7 sec of its average lifetime.

Among the 44 artiﬁcial space objects, we conﬁrmed that 17 were cataloged satellites/space debris. This
shows the usefulness of SuprimeCam wide-ﬁeld imaging programmed to study the faint meteor population
and faint space debris.

Introduction

Scientiﬁc observation of meteors is not a simple task
because of the diﬃculty in predicting their appearance in
time and position. The brightness of a meteor depends on
the size and the velocity of the meteoroid. Typical mete-
ors seen by the naked eye or by video cameras are caused
by meteoroids larger than about 0.01mm (Ceplecha et
al. 1998). However, the luminosity distribution of meteors
at its fainter end is not well-known. Moreover, the scien-
tiﬁc deﬁnition of the magnitude of meteors is not well es-
tablished because of the variety of parameters involved in
making observations, for example, the speed and distance
of the meteor and the spatial and spectral resolution and
the spatial and spectral coverage of the instrument used,

which can be the naked-eye, a video camera, an intensiﬁed
camera, a CCD camera, or another device.

Hawkins and Whipple (1958) and Cook et al. (1962)
evaluated the width of meteor trails by comparing the
measured trail width on photographs with those of stars
and derived a typical value in the order of 1m. Note
that this evaluation is from broadband images and the
decomposition analysis is a rather delicate process, as in-
dicated by some nominal negative values that were derived
(1958). Kaiser et al. (2004)
in Hawkins and Whipple
made two station, short-baseline (≤ 100m) high resolu-
tion measurements of 34 faint meterors to evaluate the
trail width using intensiﬁed CCD cameras and found that
their FWHM were generally less than 1m. Jenniskens et
al. (2004) serendipitously obtained an extended spectrum

of a meteor trail with FORS1 on VLT but the apparent
extension turned out to be caused by the defocus eﬀect
and the meteor was not spatially resolved.

The present paper reports the serendipitous observation
of meteors made with the wide-ﬁeld SuprimeCam of the
8.2m Subaru Telescope during the Perseid meteor shower
of 2004.

Perseid meteors are known to be associated with the
parent comet 109P/Swift–Tuttle , which was ﬁrst recorded
in BC 68 and returns every 135 years with recent visits in
1862 and 1992. The perihelion of 109P/Swift–Tuttle re-
mained outside the Earth’s orbit for at least for last 2000
years, but the current perihelion is at 0.958 AU. Its orbit
is highly eccentric e = 0.963 and highly inclined i = 113◦.4
with the velocity relative to the Earth as large as about 60
km/s (Lyytinen and Van Flandern 2004). When it comes
close to the Sun, a new trail is produced; at least ﬁve such
dust trails are known from passages corresponding to AD
1348, 1479, 1610, 1737, and 1862. Taking the perturba-
tion of Jupiter, Saturn and other planets into account,
Lyytinen and van Flandern (2004) calculated that the
one-revolution dust trail from the 1862 encounter passed
within 0.0013 AU from the Earth’s orbit at about 21 UT
on 11 August 2004.

2. Observations and Data Reduction

The data used were obtained serendipitously during ob-
servations on other projects. Broadband imaging obser-
vations of M31 and narrowbands imaging observations of
the Subaru Deep Field were made with the SuprimeCam
(Miyazaki et al. 2002) attached at the prime focus of the
Subaru Telescope (Iye et al. 2004) during four nights, 12–
15 August 2004, Hawaiian Standard Time (HST=UT-10),
shortly after the expected epoch of Perseid meteor events.
During the course of these observations, we serendip-
itously noticed several tracks recorded on the CCD im-
ages. Although no elaborate statistical assessment of the
mean rate of meteor/artiﬁcial satellite tracks recorded on
SuprimeCam was available at that time and although we
didn’t know how to securely discriminate meteors and ar-
tiﬁcial satellites without having double–station observa-
tions, we suspected that the event rate observed during
this period could be signiﬁcantly larger than the average.
Although we recognized that some of these recorded tracks
must have been artiﬁcial satellites, we took a closer look.
We asked SuprimeCam observers on the preceding four
nights, 8–11 August, including the Perseid peak epoch,
to check their images as well; one of these observers, I.
Iwata, reported ﬁnding nine tracks in his images. Two
other observers who conducted SuprimeCam imaging did
not ﬁnd such tracks during this period.

Table 1 summarizes the observational parameters of
all of the detected tracks recorded during eight nights of
SuprimeCam observation, 8–16 August 2004, HST. Tracks
#1−#9 were reported by I.Iwata. Tracks #10−#43 were
noticed by one of our authors, M.T., while taking a quick
look at the observed images onsite. Tracks #44−#56 also
were later noted by M.T. while reducing the imaged data.

Fig. 2. Track #50 813 56 5

Track #57 was found by M.I. while reducing the meteor
images for this paper. Eventually, this eight-night series
of SuprimeCam observations yielded 57 tracks.

brightest 5 arcmin portion. See section 4 for further de-
tails.

Figures 1 to 5 show typical images among the recorded
57 tracks. The ﬁgure 1 labeled #11 812 39 8, for exam-
ple, shows about 1800 × 1800 pixel portion of the image
of track #11 recorded on the 8th CCD of the 39th ex-
posure frame taken on 12 August, HST. To elucidate the
tracks, the surface brightness ranges of these images were
adjusted individually to give high contrast.

As will be explained later, Figure 1 was identiﬁed as
satellite COSMOS 2363 = ID98077B = NORAD#25594,
ﬂying at a high orbit with a slant range 20,000 km and an
orbiting period of 675.73 min. The brightness variation in
this frame is visible because of the rotation of the satellite.
Similar light modulation along the track was noticed also
for #5, #36, and#45.

Figure 2 is another

satellite DIAMANT B-P4 =
ID75010A = NORAD#07654, ﬂying at a low orbit, be-
low 1500 km, with an orbital period 107.69 min.

Figure 3 is a Perseid meteor at a distance of about 106
km. The track is blurred because of the signiﬁcant defocus
eﬀect that occurs when the SuprimeCam is focused to
inﬁnity.

Track #30 in Figure 4 is a sporadic meteor. This me-
teor exhibited an outburst in which its luminosity in-
creased by a factor of seven during its passage through
the SuprimeCam FOV. Another even fainter track of #57
crossing almost orthgonally to #30 is seen in the lower
left corner of this image.

Figure 5 is the brightest saturated satellite image among

the sample.

The usual procedures were taken to subtract bias,
and ﬂat-ﬁelding the raw frames was performed using the
SuprimeCam Data Reduction package SDFRED (Yagi et
al. 2002; Ouchi et al. 2004).

3.1.

Image Width

An object with a diameter D at a distance d from the
telescope, imaged by the SuprimeCam with focal length
f focused to the inﬁnity under a typical seeing of s in
radian, will have an image size w, as given by

w = pf 2D2d−2 + δ2F −2 + f 2s2,

(1)

where the second term denotes the blurred image size due
to the defocus δ of a beam with focal ratio F = 2 given by

δ = f 2/(d − f ).

(2)

Note that the pixel scale of SuprimeCam is 0.20 arc-

sec/pixel with 15µm pixel.

Figure 6 shows the calculated FWHM image width (in
arcsec) as a function of distance d under typical seeing
size of 0.8 arcsec (s = 4 × 10−6 radian) for objects with
size D=1m, 3m, and 10m. At the distance of meteors, 100
km < d < 200 km, the second term of the defocus eﬀect is
the leading term; the defocused images of meteors should
have an image size larger than 8 arcsec at a distance of

to Perseids and Aquarids are not completely denied, we con-
sider the nine meteors with ”Spo/P?”, and ”Spo/A?” deno-
tation to be sporadic meteors, based on the sporadic meteor
event rate as described in the discussion.

Column (12): Angle distance Ψ of the telescope pointing

from the radiant point.

Column (13): Meteor angular speed Ω. Except for Perseid
#17 and Aquarid #25, we adopted a canonical angular speed
◦
of 10

/s for sporadic meteors to simplify matters.

Column (9) of Table 3 shows the deviation of the position
angle δθPer of the track from the nominal Perseid radiation
point. For the daily radiant ephemeris for the Perseid me-
teor showers, we refer to Arlt (2003) and Lyytinen and van
Flandern (2004).

The spread in Perseid radiants was estimated to be
about 2–3 degrees wide (cf.Jones and Sarma 1979; Lindblad
and Porubcan 1995; Molau and Arlt 1997).
The anal-
ysis of Perseid meteors observed in 1997 (Shigeno et
al.;
http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/msswg/Ob970812.txt),
showed that the actual distribution of the radiant points of 23
bright meteors, with magnitudes ranging from 0.5 – 8.5 mag
◦
and mean magnitude 4.76, spread about 3
, while a fainter
group of 14 meteors in the range 6 – 8.5 mag, with mean mag-
◦
nitude 7.00, spread in a much wider region, 60
in right as-
◦
cension and 20
in declination. This suggests that the radiant
points of fainter meteors may spread much wider in space.

Track #17 is aligned to the position angle of the Perseid
◦
radiant point within 1
, and we associate this meteor with the
◦
Perseids. Tracks #43, 52, 57, 19, 23, and 34 are within 15
from the direction of the Perseid radiant point and although
some may be Perseids, considering the ﬁnding of Shigeno et
al.(1997), we prefer to consider them sporadic meteors based
on the mean event rates independently evaluated in other
ﬁelds.

Column (10) shows the angle deviation δθAqr to (N)δAqr
meteor radiation point. Here, we identify track #25, whose
track position angle is pointing within 3◦ from the Aquarid

less than 200 km. Note that size information of an object
smaller than 1 m cannot be retrieved from its defocused
image width.

Figure 7 shows the actual FWHM track width distribu-
tion of the 48 measured tracks. The distribution shows a
clear separation of the two populations. Thirteen tracks
are wider than 10 arcsec and correspond to meteors and
the remaining 35 tracks are narrower than 6 arcsec and
correspond to satellites and space debris.

3.2. Position Angle

Several meteor groups are known to appear during the time
period of the observations as shown in Table 2. Cassiopeids
are considered to be a parted family of Perseids.

We performed a cross-check to determine if the position an-
gles of the observed tracks point to any of the radiant points
of these meteor groups. Table 3 summarizes the results of the
meteor identiﬁcation and lists some of the physical parameters
that were measured for these 13 meteor tracks. An explanation
of the procedures adopted to derive the physical parameters is
given after the short description of each column:

Table 3. Meteors recorded during 10–16 August in their order of appearance.

radiant point, with this group of meteoroids. Again, some of
the tracks #27, 44, and 30, with angle deviation less than 12◦,
might also be members of this group, or other nearby Aquarid
groups, (S)δAqr, (N)ιAqr, or (S)ιAqr, as shown in Table 2.
Note that the position angle matched best to (N)δAqr for all
four tracks. We interpret that all of the meteors except track
#25 are largely sporadic, according to the same reasoning.

The remaining two, #40 and 54, did not match the radiant
points of the groups listed in Table 2 and are considered here to
be secure sporadic meteors. The number of sporadic meteors
in our sample is therefore at most 11.

Figures 8 and 9 show the identiﬁed meteor tracks recorded
in several contiguous CCDs. Contrast levels were adjusted
individually to make the tracks visible. Some of the meteors
showed signiﬁcant changes in their luminosity during their pas-
sage of the SuprimeCam FOV. The luminosity proﬁle of these
images is discussed in section 4.2. Note that doubly split im-
ages of meteors #27 and #43 are due to the defocused central
obscuration of the telescope.

The distance d to the meteor is given in column (4) of Table 3
using the relation d = H/sin(El), where the luminous altitude
H=100 km was assumed. The angular speed, Ω, of the meteor
entering the luminous height at a velocity v with an angular
separation Ψ, from the radiant point is given in column (13)
by

Ω = v sin(Ψ)/d,

(3)

for a Perseid and an Aquarid meteor, respectively. For other
sporadic meteors, we adopted a common canonical value of 10
degrees/sec, for simplicity.

4. Photometry

4.1. Absolute photometry and nominal CCD magnitude

We performed absolute photometry of the CCD frames by
imaging twice in each night two of the following four photo-
metric standard star ﬁelds, SA110, SA92, PG2332+055, and
MARK(Landolt 1999). The photometric zero points of V-
band and Ic-band were established by 14 to 24 standard stars
in the magnitude range 11.8 ≤ V ≤ 16.3 and 10.7 ≤ Ic ≤ 15.3
available in each shot.

For example, the Ic-band zero point of the CCD frame
SUPA00338307 for #17 and SUPA00339230 for #25 were
33.39 and 33.39 mag, respectively. The V-band zero point

of SUPA00339888 for #30 and SUPA00338900 for #19 were
34.47 and 34.48 mag respectively. The deviation of these zero
points was well less than 0.1 mag.

Table 4 summarizes the photometric properties of the 13
meteoroids. Deﬁnition of columns (1) to (5) are common to
those in Table 3. Column (6) denotes the nominal integrated
magnitude, mnom
, of the brightest 5 arcmin portion of the
track, as derived by comparing the integrated ADU counts,

5′

F nom

5′ = wIp × 1500,

(4)

where the factor 1,500 is the number of pixels along the 5
arcmin portion of the track with those of standard stars for
longer integration time. For example, the Perseid meteor #17
has wIp = 2584ADU/pixel, and the total ADC F5′ within the
brightest 5 arcmin track length is 3.9 × 106.
The nominal magnitudes are given by
5′ = −2.5log(F nom
V nom

) + 34.47,

(5)

5′

and
5′ = −2.5log(F nom
I nom

5′

) + 33.39.

(6)

Note that this is a nominal magnitude because CCD pho-
tometry for temporary luminous objects like meteors gives
apparently fainter nominal magnitudes for CCD images with
longer exposure times.

To characterize the meteor magnitude more quantitatively,
taking into account its luminous time, we introduce a possi-
ble deﬁnition of meteor magnitudes in column (8) by calculat-
ing/assuming the meteor angular velocity. This is discussed in
sections 4.2 and 4.3. The physical meaning of column (9) is
discussed in section 5.1.

Column (3): Filter band used for imaging

Column(9): Calculated maximum diameter of collisionally
excited meteors column Dcol. See section 5.1 for further de-
tails.

4.2. Video-rate magnitude

The number of 0.2 arcsec pixels that span a video frame of
0.033 sec, for a meteor with angular speed Ω deg/s is 3600 ×
0.033Ω/0.2 = 590Ω pixels. The total ADC for the brightest
observed part of the track Fvr in 33 msec is then

Fvr = wIp × 590 × Ω

= F nom

5′ × Ω × 590/1, 500,

(7)

where wIp is the average ADU count integrated perpendicu-
larly across the track over the blurred image of the meteor
given in column (4) of Table 4. For example, the Perseid me-
teor #17 has wIp = 2584ADU/pixel and an angular speed of
◦
Ω = 15.5
. The total ADC
F33 within a video-rate frame, corresponding to a track length

, or 9,200 pixels, would then be about 2.4 × 107.
of 0.52
We deﬁne the video-rate magnitudes Vvr and Ivr by

◦
/sec at an elevation angle EL = 70

Vvr = V5′ − 2.5log(Ω) − 9.64,

and

Ivr = I5′ − 2.5log(Ω) − 8.88,

(8)

(9)

where the oﬀsets of 9.64 and 8.88 correspond to the
magnitude diﬀerences 2.5 log(600/0.033×590/1500) and 2.5
log(300/0.033×590/1500), respectively.

These values are shown in column (8) of Table 4. Note that
the actual video-rate magnitude could be somewhat fainter
than the values given in column (8) as this magnitude is cal-
culated assuming that the brightness remains at a constant
maximum value throughout the 0.033sec.

4.3. Magnitude Linking to Visual Estimation

Note, however, that the magnitude mvr given here cannot be
linked well to the magnitudes reported by most of eye-witness
observers. Quantitative comparison between the ”integrated”
meteor brightness and background stars is not straightforward
because the eﬀective length of integration time corresponding
to the eye response time and the residual memory time has not
been well calibrated. The eye-witness magnitude may give a

much fainter value than the currently introduced photometric
deﬁnitions of meteor magnitude, mvr. Another physical factor
to be considered in calibrating magnitudes is the time proﬁle
of meteor radiation. Because a small, but signiﬁcant, fraction
of the photons in the V-band is emitted at the [OI] 5577A for-
bidden line that lasts 1–3 sec, the actual duration of emission
recorded in the present observation would be longer than the
adopted video-rate and hence the actual magnitude corrected
for this afterglow duration time, mcor, could be at most 2–3
mag fainter than Vvr.
In the Ic band, where the OI 7774A
and N2 bands are dominant and no signiﬁcant forbidden line
contributes, such an afterglow eﬀect would be negligible.

Therefore, most of the currently observed meteors could pos-
sibly be as faint as 7 –8 mag to visual observers. However, we
will not pursue a rigorous quantitative calibration between eye
estimate magnitudes and the photon counting magnitude in
this paper.

4.4. Luminosity Proﬁles

Figures 10 and 11 present a luminosity proﬁle scanned along
the track of all of the recorded meteors. The ADU count aver-
aged over the FWHM is shown in these plots. Bright spikes in
the proﬁle are due to stars and/or hot pixels and the lower en-
velope of the proﬁle indicates the meteor luminosity. Some of
the meteors, for example, #19 and #23, show fairly constant
brightness. However, the meteor #30 ﬂared up by a factor of
7 in brightness and meteor #27 showed a gradual change in
luminosity by a factor of 3 within the recorded frame. The
FWHM track length for the ﬂare-up of meteor #30 is about
500 arcsec (= 2500 pixels), corresponding to an elapsed time
of 14 msec. This event could be employed to constrain the
ablation process through the use of an appropriate model.

5. Discussion

5.1. Rate of Sporadic Meteors

To evaluate the rate of sporadic meteors, we examined
209 SuprimeCam frames (2090 CCD images) obtained for the
Subaru Deep Field (SDF) during 2001–2004, which are pub-
licly available in the Subaru data archive. 173 frames are in
the I
band with an exposure time of 210 to 300 sec, and 46
frames are in the V band with an exposure time 720 to 900
sec. Most of the exposures were taken in March, April, and
May. The total exposure time of these frames amounted to

21.6 hours, somewhat longer than the 19 hours for the cur-
rent M31 observation. A total of 29 meteor events was con-
ﬁrmed in these SDF images. The SDF is in the constellation
of Coma, where a modest meteor group was expected around
19 January. However, considering that the SDF observations
were made much later than this shower period and that no
other prominent meteor showers occurred during this time, we
regard most of the SDF meteors as sporadic. Since we have no
information that allows us to subtract possible shower events
in SDF meteors, we retained all of the 29 SDF meteors as well
as 13 M31 meteors in the current observation to compare their
general event rates. The average event rate of SDF meteors
thus obtained is 1.96 ± 0.63 times larger than, but comparable
to what we obtained in the M31 ﬁeld, supporting the conclu-
sion that most of the meteors observed are also sporadic. We
could not determine whether the factor of two diﬀerence in the
event rate is signiﬁcant.

5.2. Cross Section of the Collision Column

As shown in Figure 6, the current defocused observation can-
not resolve a source size smaller than about 1m. However the
following consideration gives a crude size estimate of the col-
umn cross section where the meteor collided with atmospheric
atoms.

Adopting the system’s photon detection eﬃciency of 50%
by taking the optics throughput, ﬁlter transmission, and CCD
quantum eﬃciency into account, and applying the ADC con-
version factor of 2.6 e/ADC for the SuprimeCam, we can eval-
uate the integrated photon counts.

For example, the meteor track #19 produced a total of 5.7×
108 photons received in the V-band by the Subaru Telescope
during its 33 msec travel of L = 2 km length at 60km/sec
and at about 100km in height, corresponding to a distance
of 138km from the telescope. Assuming isotropic emission,
one can derive the total number of photons emitted by this
meteor during the 33msec as Nphoton = 2.6×1018 photons. The
average density of neutral oxygen atoms at a 100km height is

about nOI = 1018 m−3. As a fraction η of all of the photons
are emitted in [OI] 5577 by collisional excitation, this requires
the eﬀective cross section S, given by the following equation;

ηNphoton = nOI SL.

(10)

A typical meteor spectrum gives a rough estimate of the
fraction of [OI] contribution in the V-band at about η = 0.1.
By inserting the observed numbers for meteor #19, we obtain
−5m2, corresponding to an eﬀective diameter of
S = 8.3 × 10
the collision column of Dcol = 10.3mm. The diameter of the
collision column thus calculated is given for four meteors ob-
served in the V-band in column (9) of Table 4, which is in the
range of 2.4mm ≤ Dcol ≤ 10.3mm .

Note that this value represents the diameter of the column
where the main body of the meteor collided with atmospheric
atoms, molecules, and electrons, and where the successive cas-
cade collisions of these particles with the neutral oxygen atoms
took place. These collisions excited the neutral oxygen atoms
to the energy level, which released the subsequent forbidden
line [OI] 5577.

On average, the actual emission of the forbidden line oc-
curred 0.7 sec after the collisional excitation. Therefore, the
excited oxygen atoms were dispersed by thermal motions up
to few hundred meters away from the original collision column
before producing the forbidden-line radiation. The size of the
radiating zone of the forbidden line, therefore, would be as
large as few 100 m.

Note that this should be the size observed in [OI]5577
monochromatic images of meteors. The width of meteor im-
ages recorded in normal broadband frames represents the size
of the hot column, which is much narrower than the [OI] wake
column and would be about 1 cm – 1 m. This is consistent
with the independent result of two station, short baseline ob-
servation of 34 faint meteors using intensiﬁed CCD cameras
(Kaiser et al. 2004).

5.3. Radiation Eﬃciency and Meteor Mass

The kinetic energy Ek of a meteor particle of mass m with

relative velocity to the Earth v is given by

Ek = mv2/2.

(11)

Again, by assuming isotropic radiation, a photon detection
eﬃciency of 50%, and an ADC conversion factor of 2.6 e/ADC,
we can estimate the total number of photons Nph emitted by
the meteor during, for example, the 33msec from the video-rate
ADC count Fvr measured by the Subaru Telescope.

Nph = 4πd2Fvr/πR2 × 2.6 × 2,

(12)

where d is the distance to the meteor and R=4.1m is the radius
of the Subaru primary mirror.

The total photon energy emitted is then

Ep = hνNph,

(13)

where hν is the mean energy of a photon, and the conversion
eﬃciency ǫ of thermalized energy into photons is therefore,

ǫ = Ep/Ek.

(14)

Or, conversely, if we assume ǫ = 0.002 Campbell-Brown and
Koschny (2004), we can estimate the mass of the meteor from
its magnitude as
m = 2Ep/v2ǫ

(15)

For meteor #19, for example, Ep= 0.94J, for an average V -
−19J. The corresponding mass would
−6kg= 1.1 mg

band photon of 3.6 × 10
therefore be m = 1.92/(30,000)2 /0.002 = 1.1 × 10

5.4. Faint meteor population and [OI] imaging

Pawlowski et al. (2001) observed very faint Leonid mete-
ors in 1999 using an intensiﬁed CCD system mounted on a
3m liquid mirror telescope (LMT). Although their observation
was sensitive down to 18 mag, the integrated magnitude along
the track ranged from 5 to 10 mag, corresponding to a meteor
mass of 100 to 1 µg. They estimated that the number ﬂux
of these small Leonid meteors was about 1/hour/km2 perpen-
dicular to the Leonid stream. Pawlowski’s LMT observation
◦
with IICCD, covering a 0.28
ﬁeld, enabled detection of 140
non-Leonid events per hour, which is astonishing. Our present
observation was not as deep as their detection sensitivity due
to the defocus eﬀect of SuprimeCam. Dedicated meteor imag-
ing with SuprimeCam focused to about 150 km distance would
yield about a 3 mag gain in sensitivity and would provide im-
portant information on the faint population of meteors.

SuprimeCam Perseid radiant point imaging using an inter-
mediate band ﬁlter IB550 to make [OI] 5577 line imaging would
be useful to study the collisional excitation proﬁle of the meteor
events and their successive line emitting time proﬁle as shown
by the drifting meteor wakes. Two-dimensional images of each
wake will show proﬁles of collisional excitation and their drift-
ing emission. SuprimeCam should be oﬀset by about 1.5mm
to focus at 150 km distance, which is close to, but still within,
the limit of the top-unit travel dynamic range. Such an obser-
vation will also give clues to the faint population of meteoroids
and would be worth planning.

6. Satellites and Space Debris

◦

Some of the tracks were promptly identiﬁed by K.Y. as arti-
ﬁcial satellites by cross-checking with the NORAD Two-Line-
Element database of registered orbit data for 8,888 satellites as
of 15 August 2004, which was provided by Mike McCants via
Yokohama Kagaku-kan. The possible satellites that pass the
◦ × 1
1
FOV centered at the telescope pointing during the 5
minute before the start of exposure and 5 minute after the end
of exposure were listed up and compared to the recorded track
for its position angle. Satellite tracks candidates thus identi-
ﬁed are given their NORAD number in the fourth column of
Table 5. No check was performed to determine whether the
satellite was in a sunny region and thus reﬂected sunshine.

A separate, more extensive check was performed by C. H.
at JAXA based on the Two-Line-Element data released by
the NASA/GSFC Orbital Information Group. For example,
Figure 12 shows the tracks of artiﬁcial objects that came close
to the observed ﬁeld of track#11 at the time of exposure. In
this case, the artiﬁcial object, ID98077B, was conﬁrmed to pass
the SuprimeCam FOV during the 600 sec exposure time to
take the image #11 812 38 along the direction of the observed
track. However, the track found in Figure 13, for example, did
not match to any of the 8,888 listed artiﬁcial bodies.

As shown in Table 5, seventeen tracks among the 44 non-
meteor tracks coincided with recorded artiﬁcial satellites or
space debris. Twenty-seven tracks, however, were not identi-
ﬁed with an object in any available catalog. Some of these
might be uncatalogued space debris objects. A possible error
in orbital elements due to the secular changes of orbit, espe-
cially for low orbits objects, can also lead to cross-identiﬁcation
failure.

Group (Data on 08/11/2004 – 08/16/2004).

7. Conclusion

The Subaru prime focus camera, when focused to inﬁnity,
gives a conspicuously defocused image of meteors. The meth-
ods to discriminate meteors from artiﬁcial satellites/space de-
bris were discussed. Serendipitous detection of 13 meteors dur-
ing the later phase of the Perseid shower period was reported,
but only 1 was securely identiﬁed as a member of the Perseids.
Another meteor was ascribed to the Aquarids, but most of
the remaining meteors were likely sporadic ones. Photometric
magnitudes of these meteors were measured from the CCD
frames by introducing a deﬁnition of video-rate magnitude
to integrate ﬂux along the tracks. Problems in linking eye-
estimated magnitudes by visual observers to these photometric
CCD magnitudes were discussed.

Simple calculation of the number of collisional excitations
required to account for the [OI] 5577 forbidden line ﬂux pro-
vides a new method to evaluate the diameter of the collision
In this way, we derived, for the
columns of these meteors.

ﬁrst time, that the sizes of the collision columns of these me-
teors are approximately a few mm in diameter. Considering
the relatively long lifetime (0.7 sec) for releasing the [OI] 5577
emission, the actual column size of the [OI] 5577 line-emitting
region would be few 100m in diameter due to the thermal dif-
fusion of excited oxygen atoms before releasing the forbidden
line photons.
