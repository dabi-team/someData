ABSTRACT

With the rapid development of augmented reality (AR) and
virtual reality (VR) technology, human-computer interaction
(HCI) has been greatly improved for gaming interaction of
AR and VR control. The ﬁnger micro-gesture is one of the
important interactive methods for HCI applications such as in
the Google Soli and Microsoft Kinect projects. However, the
progress in this research is slow due to the lack of high quality
public available database. In this paper, holoscopic 3D cam-
era is used to capture high quality micro-gesture images and
a new unique holoscopic 3D micro-gesture (HoMG) database
is produced. The principle of the holoscopic 3D camera is
based on the ﬂys viewing system to see the objects. HoMG
database recorded the image sequence of 3 conventional ges-
tures from 40 participants under different settings and condi-
tions. For the purpose of micro-gesture recognition, HoMG
has a video subset with 960 videos and a still image subset
with 30635 images. Initial micro-gesture recognition on both
subsets has been conducted using traditional 2D image and
video features and popular classiﬁers and some encouraging
performance has been achieved. The database will be avail-
able for the research communities and speed up the research
in this area.

as its immersive user experience and usability [19]. There
displays support the 3D gesture systems and need free space
to support ﬂexible interaction [17].. However, these systems
lack the ability to capture quality and accurate objects which
could be seen as one of its major drawbacks[2]. Recently,
some new research from Leap Motion [10] and Google Soli
Project [8] created new techniques for 3D detection that has
huge potentials for success. Holoscopic 3D (H3D) imaging
system is a novel potential technique which can satisfy the
higher demand of user interactive experience. Detection of
precision 3D micro-gesture can make use of the wide view
coverage the of Holoscopic 3D camera to capture accurate
ﬁnger movement [16].

This paper aims to use the H3D imaging system to create
a unique 3D micro-gesture database, further to promote the
gesture recognition. Even using H3D system is depart from
precedents in capture and recognition of the gesture area, this
technology was mature to use the 3DTV and display area.
Meanwhile, the H3D system also supports the RGB high qual-
ity dynamic and static data, and it is renowned for high accu-
racy and true 3D to excellence than traditional 3D capture
devices.

1. INTRODUCTION

Gesture is a remarkable interaction way for Human Computer
Interaction (HCI), which is a conventional non-verbal com-
munication method. It is one type of pervasive body language
that can be used for communication. However, with the devel-
opment of the gaming interaction and wearable device, pre-
cise ﬁnger gesture have more advantages than body gesture,
especially for control devices[4] The ﬁnger movement is one
of the micro-gestures that can accurately manipulate the de-
vice. Kinect and RBG-D camera are popular sensors for gam-
ing in the Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)
community with its low-cost been a major advantage, as well

HCI appeared early in 1983 [18], which use multiple modal-
ities such as voice, gestures (e.g. body, hand, arm, ﬁnger,
etc.). For example, Siri [3] is a very popular voice-based in-
terface. However nature gesture is another way to interact
with the computer. The trend of the HCI is user experience of
intuitionistic and effective [17]. Gesture is a touchless, non-
intrusive method for HCI, and it is represented as the diverse
type of the gestures [13]. Manipulative type of gesture ap-
pears the most popular one from the preciously literatures.
The aim is to control entity being manipulated through the
actual movements of the gesturing hand and arm [7]. Hand as
a direct input device is more and more popular, as one of the
outstanding interaction methods.

The Kinect and RGB-D camera are very popular in re-
cent years due to the beneﬁts of Kinect and RGB-D camera

that have low cost and wide availability as a sensor [15] to
capture gestures. However, RGB-D camera suffers from the
underside artefacts such as the edge inaccuracies, low object
remission and holes owning [2]. The Kinect sensor offers the
information of the depth measurement and create coordinates
of the 3D objects. Although the abundant development toolk-
its can support the human body recognition, the weakness is
its lacking ability to capture the ﬂexible and robust mecha-
nism to perform high-level gesture [5].

Leap Motion (LM) [14] is a device that can be used to
detect the hand and ﬁnger dynamic movements through its
API software. The API has the robust pre-processing function
which can reduce the complexity of the user control. How-
ever, LM is a monocular video sensor which is a challenging
for capturing the abundant dynamic hand gestures and ﬁnger
micro movements [9].

Holoscopic 3D camera is a single aperture sensor not only
to represent the real-time and represents a true volume spa-
tial optical model of the object scene but also to record the
viewing natural continuous parallax 3D objects within a wide
viewing zone [21]. It provides a new way to capture micro-
gestures.

Isaac et al. [17] presents a review summary of 21 ges-
ture datasets from previous research and publicly datasets, in
which 7 databases are for hands. Most datasets are recorded
using to the Kinect or RGB-D camera as the sensor.

In order to the support the diversiﬁcation of the gesture
recognition and encourage development of the human com-
puter interaction, We propose a new 3D gesture database in-
cluded the three ubiquitous micro gestures that are most the
popular ones used in the Google Soli project. Those are in-
tuitive and unobtrusive manipulative gesture. This database
is not only include the continuous dynamic data, but also
contained the abundant static data to support the 3D micro-
gesture recognition.

3. DATABASE CONSTRUCTION

3.1. Micro-gestures

There are many micro-gestures that can be used for control
in AR and VR applications. In this research, three intuitive
micro-gestures are selected refer to the Google Soli project [8]
as shown in Fig.1. The three gestures are based on the human
intuitiveness when they try to control display. For instance,
the button gesture is the submission, dial gesture shows that
user want to slight change the current situation, and the slider
gesture is to express the slide up or down to adjust the volume
and options. This three gesture belongs to the manipulative
type of the gesture, which use to touch- less control the de-
vices or simulation console.

3.2. H3D imaging technology

H3D imaging technology is success for use in the 3D cinema,
3D-capable televisions and broadcasters. The H3D camera
used here is built from the 3D Vivant Project (3D Live Im-
merse Video-Audio Interactive Multimedia) [1] and the pur-
pose is to capture high quality 3D images. The developed
camera includes micro-lens array, relay lens and digital cam-
era sensors. The principle of the holoscopic 3D imaging is
shown in Fig.2. The 3D holoscopic image’s spatial sampling
is determined by the number of lens. It shows that the cap-
tured 2D lenslet array views is slight different angle than its
neighbor and reconstructed image in relay [1]. The detailed
parameters of the camera are shown in Fig.3.

Holoscopic 3D camera sensor has unique optical compo-
nents which support the continuous parallax RGB image sys-
tem, contain the depth information viewpoint images. The
ﬁgure show the H3D imaging having the full color with full
parallax. H3D imaging is comprised of the 2D array of micro
images.

The H3D sensor is a crucial requirement for the capture
of the objects. This database uses the H3D imaging system
to support the dynamic and static RGB data. And its not only
can record the continuous motion, but repetitive lens array can
extract different angles viewpoint images. The uniqueness to
encourage the innovation of gesture capture and recognition.

positions are the close and far locations where the objective
lens set to 45cm and 95cm. The other two positions are from
left and right hand side for the convenience of the partici-
pants. In the close position, we set a hollow frame to help
the participant to ﬁnd the 3D micro-gesture capture zone. We
remind the participants the gesture name while record their
ﬁnger movements. The participants can perform their micro-
gesture at their own speed. The recording are done during the
time around 15 minutes for one participant.

We prepared two different colour backgrounds, two dif-
ferent distances of close and far from end of the camera lens to
gesture area. The recorded imaging resolution is 1086x1902,
and the micro lens is 28x28. Participants are successively
stand each pre-established position to play three gestures around
3-5 seconds. The three gestures are involved button, dial and
slider.

3.4. Participants

In total, 40 participants attended the recordings including 17
female participants and 33 male participants, who all read the
participant information sheet guidance and sign the research
ethics application forms before the recording. There is no
any limited of age and race for the participants and We re-
spect the participants will. Some participants wear married
rings and watches during the recording on ﬁnger movements.
These increase the datas noise and bring more challenges. We
recorded the participants double hands in order to increase the
diversity of the data. The detailed information about the data
acquisition is summarized in Table 1.

3.5. HoMG Database

For the data collection, the recordings from 40 participants
are selected to make the HoMG database. The recordings
were done under different conditions. One participants were

The recording H3D gesture place, as in Fig.4. A green
screen room is used for the recording where it can offer clear
and professional recording background to reduce noise. Be-
fore the recording, the holoscopic 3D camera adapter and sur-
face are set up in advance. Canon 5D camera is used and the
ﬁlm speed is ISO200, shutter 1/250. Holoscopic 3D camera
adapter is calibrated and the lens are corrected.

Considering to the inﬂuence from distances, angles, and
backgrounds, we prepared 4 positions for participants. Two

recorded 24 videos. In total, 960 videos are included in the
database.

For micro-gesture recognition, it can be done based on
single image or can be done from a short video. So this
database was divided into two subsets: image based and video
based micro-gesture subsets.

3.5.1. Video subset

There are 40 subjects and each subject has 24 videos due to
the different setting and three gestures. For each video, the
frame rate is 25 frames per second and length of videos are
from few seconds to 20 seconds and not equally. The whole
dataset was divided into 3 parts. 20 subjects for training set,
10 subjects for development set and another 10 subjects for
testing set. In this way, the micro-gesture recognition are per-
son independent.

3.5.2. Image subset

Video can capture the motion information of the micro-gesture
and it is a good way for micro-gesture recognition. However,
it needs more data and take long time. It is very interesting to
see whether it is possible to recognise the micro-gesture from
a single image with high accuracy.

From each video recording, different number of frames
were selected as the still micro-gesture images. In total, there
are 30635 images selected. The whole dataset were split into
three partitions: a Training, Development, and Testing par-
tition. There are 15237 images in the training subsets of 20
participants with 8364 in close distance and 6853 in far dis-
tance. There are 6956 images in the development subsets of
10 participants with 3077 in close distance and 3879 in far
distance. There are 8442 images in the testing subsets of 10
participants with 3930 in close distance and 4512 in far dis-
tance.

4. INITIAL INVESTIGATION ON MICRO-GESTURE
RECOGNITION

The initial investigation are carried out independently for video
and image based micro-gesture recognition study. We would
like to see how high performance can be achieved from each
way.

4.1. Video based micro-gesture recognition

There are many good features that can be extracted from each
video to capture the movement of the ﬁngers. Here LBP-
TOP [20] and LPQTOP [6] are selected. These features can
not only calculate the distribution of the local information
of each frame, but also the distribution of ﬁnger movements
along to the time. From each video, the frame size was re-
duced to 74x42 from 1920x1080 ﬁrstly, then a feature vector

with dimension of 768 is extracted using LBPTOP and LPQ-
TOP for the classiﬁcation. For the classiﬁcation, it is a three
class classiﬁcation problem. There are lots of classiﬁers avail-
able. Here, most popular ones such as k-NN, Support Vector
Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes classiﬁers are chosen for
comparison purpose.

Table 2 shows the accuracy using three different classi-
ﬁers under different distance on video based micro-gesture
recognition. From this table, it can be seen that LPQTOP is
better than LBPTOP for feature extraction. SVM is better
than k-NN and Naive Bayes classiﬁers in most cases. The ac-
curacy on close distance is better than far distance because the
detailed information of the ﬁnger movement can be captured.
For the testing set, both training and development sets were
used for training. Overall, 66.7% accuracy can be achieved
even use the feature extraction methods from all videos in the
testing set.

4.2. Image based micro-gesture recognition

For each image, 2D texture features such LBP [11] and LPQ
[12] were extracted to represent each image. These two fea-
tures captured the edge and local information of the 2D image
in different ways and form a histogram feature vector with
dimension of 256. Popular classiﬁcation methods such as k-
NN, SVM and Naive Bayes classiﬁers were used for recog-
nising the three different micro-gestures.

Table 3 should the experimental results on video based
micro-gesture recognition by training on the training set and
tested on development and testing subsets. From this table, it
can be seen that for most of the classiﬁcations, around 50%
accuracy can be achieved.

gesture recognition on development (Dev.) and testing sets

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS

5.1. Conclusions

This paper introduces a unique holoscopic 3D micro-gesture
database (HoMG), which is recorded under different settings
and conditions from 40 participants. The data recording uses
the similar the H3D system of ﬂy viewing to capture the par-
ticipants precise ﬁnger movements. The H3D imaging system
supports robust 3D depth micro lens array to capture dynamic
and static information. The HoMG database has 3 unobtru-
sive manipulative gestures in two different backgrounds, two
different distances, left and right hands. These micro-gestures
can be used to control multifarious displays. This database
would speed up the research in this area.

The database is further divided into video and image sub-
sets. Initial investigation on micro-gesture recognition is con-
ducted. For the comparison, video based method achieved
better performance as it has dynamic ﬁnger movement in-
formation in the data. However, this method needs much
more data and computing time. Image based method is con-
venient for the user and might have more applications, es-
pecially on the portable devices. Even with the standard 2D
feature extraction methods and basic classiﬁcation methods,
72.5% recognition accuracy can be achieved for micro-gesture
videos and over 50% accuracy for micro-gesture images. This
baseline methods and results will give a foundation for other
researchers to explore their methods.

5.2. Future works

From the initial investigation, it can be seen that the recogni-
tion accuracy can reach around 66% even just using the 2D
image processing methods. For 3D image processing meth-
ods, such as extracting the different viewing point images and
extract 3D information of the micro-gesture, high accuracy
will be achieved. This will be our future works.
