Evidence for Corotation Origin of Super Metal-Rich Stars in LAMOST-Gaia: Multiple
Ridges with a Similar Slope in φ versus Lz Plane
Yuqin Chen,∗ Gang Zhao,∗ and Haopeng Zhang∗

ABSTRACT
Super metal-rich (SMR) stars in the solar neighborhood are thought to be born in the
inner disk and came to present location by radial migration, which is most intense at the
co-rotation resonance (CR) of the Galactic bar. In this work, we show evidence for the
CR origin of SMR stars in LAMOST-Gaia by detecting six ridges and undulations in the
φ versus Lz space coded by median VR, following a similar slope of −8 km s−1 kpc deg−1 .
The slope is predicted by Monario et al.’s model for CR of a large and slow Galactic
bar. For the ﬁrst time, we show the variation of angular momentum with azimuths from
−10◦ to 20◦ for two outer and broad undulations with negative VR around −18 km s−1
following this slope. The wave-like pattern with large amplitude outside CR and a wide
peak of the second undulations indicate that minor merger of the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy with the disk might play a role besides the signiﬁcant impact of CR of the
Galactic bar.

1. INTRODUCTION

With the release of the Gaia data, rich structures in the phase-space distribution have been revealed.
For instance, multiple ridges displayed in velocity space were found by Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018)
and Ramos et al. (2018). Fragkoudi et al. (2019) also reported the ridge of the Hercules moving group,
and many features, so-called ”horn” and ”hat”, in the R versus Vφ coded by mean VR velocity. The
origins of these rich structures is a debate topic with the Hercules moving group as a typical case.
It has been suggested that the Hercules moving group, ﬁrst reported in Dehnen (1999), was formed
outside of the bar’s outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) based on a faster bar (Monari et al. 2016).
However, P´erez-Villegas et al. (2017) favored for the scenario that orbits trapped at the co-rotation
resonance (CR) of a slow bar could produce the Hercules moving group in local velocity space. Based
on the Galactic model of P´erez-Villegas et al. (2017), Monari et al. (2019b) proposed that no fewer
than six ridges in local action space that can be related to resonances of this slow bar, which induces
a wave-like pattern with wavenumber of m = 6 excitation. However, Friske & Sch¨onrich (2019)
explained the ridges in the average Galactocentric radial velocity as a function of angular momentum
and azimuth as a wavenumber m = 4 pattern caused by spiral arms.

Most of the observed structures in the phase-space distribution can be explained by diﬀerent com-
binations of non-axisymmetric perturbations, making their modeling degenerate (Hunt et al. 2019).
Meanwhile, the relative contribution of the CR and OLR resonances (e.g. for the Hercules moving
group) is diﬀerent between the slow and fast rotation speed of the Galactic bar. The combination of
diﬀerent resonances due to various perturbations make it diﬃcult to discover their origins. Following
the ridges as a function of azimuth provides a promising way to disentangle the eﬀect of diﬀerent res-
onances. In this respect, Monari et al. (2019a) shows that the Hercules angular momentum changes
signiﬁcantly with azimuth as expected for the CR resonance of a dynamically old large bar. They
proposed that such a variation would not happen close to the OLR of a faster bar at least for 2 Gyr
after its formation.

In this letter, we investigate the variation of angular momentum (Lz) with Galactic azimuth (φ)
coded by VR using SMR stars in the LAMOST-Gaia survey as tracers. Since SMR stars in the solar
neighborhood are thought to originate from the inner disk (Kordopatis et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2019,
2003), features related to the CR resonance of the Galactic bar should be easily identiﬁed in this
special population.

2. DATA

SMR stars with [Fe/H] > 0.2 and spectral signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) larger than 10 are selected
from LAMOST DR7 (Zhao et al. 2006, 2012; Cui et al. 2012; Deng et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2015),
which provide radial velocity and updated stellar parameters based on methods in Luo et al. (2015).
Then we cross-match this sample with Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) to obtain proper
motions, and limit stars with errors in proper motions less than 0.05 mas/yr, and the renormalized
unit weight error of RU W E < 1.44 (Lindegren et al. 2018). Bayesian distances are from the StarHorse
code (Anders et al. 2019) using Gaia EDR3 and stars with relative error less than 10% are adopted.
The radial velocity are based on the LAMOST survey, and stars with errors in radial velocity larger
than 10 km s−1 are excluded from the sample.

Galactocentric positions, spatial velocity and orbital parameters (apocentric/pericentric distances,
Rapo and Rper) are calculated based on the publicly available code Galpot with the default potential
(MilkyWayPotential) provided by McMillan (2017). Note that Lz are calculated with the deﬁnition
of Equation (3.72) as presented in Binney & Tremaine (2008), while Monari et al. (2019a) adopted
an approximate value of RVφ. We use the cylindrical coordinate (VR, Vφ, VZ) with the Sun’s distance
from the Galactic centre R = 8.21 kpc, the solar peculiar velocity of (U(cid:12), V(cid:12), W(cid:12)) = (11.1, 12.24,
7.25) km s−1 (Sch¨onrich et al. 2010) and the circular speed of Vc = 233.1 km s−1 (McMillan 2011).
The sample have 214,199 star stars with velocities between −300 km s−1 and +300 km s−1 , and
the velocity dispersions of (36.1,23.1, 17.3) km s−1 in (VR, Vφ, VZ). Their Galactic locations are of
7 < R < 10 kpc, and −0.5 < Z < 1.5 kpc with peaks at R = 8.5 kpc and |Z| ∼ 0.25 kpc, respectively.

3. THE φ VERSUS Lz PLANE
Figure 1 shows the φ versus Lz space coded by median VR for SMR stars. There are six ridges
and undulations, generally following a similar slope of −8 km s−1 kpc deg−1 , which is predicted for
stars with orbits trapped at CR in the Galactic model of Monari et al. (2019b). The red ridge with
positive median VR following the red line of Lz = −8 ∗ φ + 1600 km s−1 kpc corresponds to the
Hercules moving group in Monari et al. (2019a), and for comparison we plot the green line, which
has a zero slope with Lz = 1600 km s−1 kpc at φ = 0, as expected for the OLR in the bar model.

3

Note that the range of mean VR in Monari et al. (2019a) (their Fig. 2) is of ±20 km s−1 , while the
coverage of ±50 km s−1 in median VR is adopted in our Fig. 1. The uncertainties of the median VR
for these features are of 0.5-1.0 km/s.

Except for the Hercules moving group, two ridges (with intercepts of 1380 and 1920 km s−1 kpc)
and three undulations (with intercepts of 1500, 1800 and 2100 km s−1 kpc) are clearly shown. The
similar slope in the Lz versus φ plane for the six ridges and undulations indicates that the bar’s
resonance is not limited within the location of Hercules moving group (Lz = 1600 km s−1 kpc), but
has signiﬁcant eﬀect in the solar neighborhood ( Lz = 2100 km s−1 kpc).

Meanwhile, positive median VR are found for the inner region of Lz < 1700 km s−1 kpc, above which
median VR are negative except for a narrow ridge of Lz = −8 ∗ φ + 1920 km s−1 kpc with median VR
in the order of 10 km s−1 . This transition may indicates that minor merge event might start to take
eﬀect, which signiﬁcantly increase the variation amplitude and make the undulations wider. Since
the slope of −8 km s−1 kpc deg−1 persists, we expect that the role of the CR is still signiﬁcant in the
outer region of Lz > 1700 km s−1 kpc for SMR stars. Interestingly, Gaia Collaboration et al. (2022)
found a somewhat similar velocity distribution with a lower velocity variation (see their Fig. 16),
but a change in the sign of VR velocity (as a function of Galactocentric angle) at a radius of 10 kpc,
in phase with the bar angle, is not seen in our SMR sample because only a small fraction of SMR
stars in our sample could reach to 10 kpc.

Although the wave-like pattern between the ridges and undulations are found for both the inner
and outer regions but the amplitudes and the widths are diﬀerent. The two blue undulations in the
outer region have (negative) median VR of ∼ −18 km s−1 , while the two ridges in the inner disk have
(positive) median VR around 21 km s−1 . The width of the outest undulation at Lz = 2100 km s−1 kpc
is largest, spanning a range of 2.5 kpc from 7 to 9.5 kpc in term of guiding radius Rg, and the median
VR is the most negative, which indicates extra mechanisms, such as the minor merge of the Sgr dwarf
galaxy, may play an important contribution to this undulation.

4. THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF PERICENTRE AND APOCENTRE DISTANCES

In order to know how far these SMR stars can reach in the Galactic inner and outer disks, Fig. 2
shows the distribution of pericentre and apocentrc distances for all stars (red solid lines) and stars
aligned with the Sun and the Galactic centre (black dash lines). Then we ﬁt the distributions with
two gaussian functions for stars at the solar azimuth (φ = 0) and obtain two peaks for pericentre and
apocentre distances respectively. The main peak of pericentre distance is at 7.25 kpc and a second
peak at 5.62 kpc, while the histogram of apocentre distance shows a main peak at 8.6 kpc and the
second peak at 9.4 kpc. It is found that 79% SMR stars excurse within 4 kpc around the location
of the Sun at 8.2 kpc. The second peak of pericentre distance at 5.6 kpc is interesting because it is
close to the CR position at 6 kpc in P´erez-Villegas et al. (2017) and very close to 5.5 kpc in Bovy
et al. (2019) for a slow bar. There are 36% SMR stars with pericentre distance less than 6.5 kpc,
and they are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the CR of the Galactic bar. Finally, the apocentre distribution
has a second peak at 9.4 kpc, which is within the the bar’s OLR at about 10.5 kpc according to
P´erez-Villegas et al. (2017).

5. COMPARISON WITH THE GALACTIC BAR MODEL

Based on a realistic model for a slowly rotating large Galactic bar with pattern speed of Ωb =
39 km s−1 kpc−1, Monari et al. (2019b) show no fewer than six ridges in local action space that can

4

Figure 1. Median VR in the φ versus Lz space for SMR stars.The red lines for ridges (high VR) and
blue lines for undulations (low VR) correspond to a slope of −8 km s−1 kpc deg−1 (expected for CR), while
the green line corresponds to 0 km s−1 kpc deg−1 (expected for OLR). Note that the red line of Lz =
−8φ + 1600 km s−1 kpc corresponds to the location of the Hercules moving group as previously reported by
Monari et al. (2019a).

be related to resonances with the bar. It is interesting that SMR stars in the present sample do show
six ridges and undulations in the Lz versus φ plane. For direct compariosn, we adopt the Galactic
coordinate frame for stellar velocity (U,V,W) and show the R − V diagram coded by median −U in
Fig. 3, which matches their Fig. 6 quite well. Speciﬁcally, the ridge at Lz of 1380 corresponds to CR
(their green line) feature and the undulation at Lz = 2100 km s−1 kpc ﬁts the OLR (their red line)
feature. The two ridges (at 1600 and 1920 km s−1 kpc) are associated with the 6:1 (pink) and 3:1
(purple) resonances, and one undulation at 1800 km s−1 kpc is related to the 4:1 (blue) resonance.
Note that the two ridges at Lz = 1380 km s−1 kpc and Lz = 1600 km s−1 kpc in the present work
are the same as the strong positive VR features near Lz = 1400 and Lz = 1600 observed in the solar
neighborhood by Chiba & Sch¨onrich (2021) based on Gaia DR2 as a result of the bar’s resonance.
They also suggested a slow bar with the current pattern speed of Ωb = 35.5 km s−1 kpc−1, and placed
the corotation radius at 6.6 kpc. Moreover, Chiba et al. (2021) introduced a decelerating bar model,
which can reproduce with its corotation resonance the oﬀset and strength of the Hercules stream in
the local VR versus Vφ plane and the double-peaked structure of mean VR in the Lz − φ plane due to

the accumulation of orbits near the boundary of the resonance. Further work on the comparison of
the model’s result with observation is desire.

In sum, the multiple ridges and undulations found for SMR stars in Fig. 1 can be explained by
the bar resonances in the model of Monari et al. (2019b). Their similar slope indicates that these
features (even in the OLR region) are aﬀected by the CR of the slow and long bar. But the strong
VR modulations from ridges to undulations and very wide range in the last undulation beyond the
CR region suggest that minor merger may also play an role in the Galactic disk.

Finally, we investigate chemical signatures of the six ridges and undulations based on abundances in
Li et al. (2022), and there are 42,109 SMR stars with [Mg/Fe] ratios available. There is no diﬀerence
in [Mg/Fe] among ridges and undulations. Both have a peak at [Mg/Fe] ∼ 0.05 dex, typical for the
old bar. Based on the LAMOST middle resolution survey, Zhang et al. (2021) also suggested that
SMR stars have slightly enhanced [Mg/Fe] = 0.08 dex. Note that stars from the Sgr dwarf galaxy
itself usually have low [Mg/Fe] ∼ −0.05 at [Fe/H] ∼ −0.4, and there is no star with solar metallicity
as shown in Fig. 9 of Zhao & Chen (2021). Therefore, these SMR stars in the present work are not
from the Sgr dwarf galaxy itself, but the minor merge event of the Sgr dwarf galaxy with the Galactic
disk could induce strong modulations of VR from ridges to undulations, and make the undulation at
Lz = 2100 km s−1 kpc becomes wider.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have detected, for the ﬁrst time, six ridges and undulations following a single slope in the φ
versus Lz plane coded by median VR from a speciﬁc population of SMR stars based on LAMOST
DR7 and Gaia EDR3. Speciﬁcally, the variation of radial velocity with angular momentum Lz and

azimuth φ for the six ridges and undulations is seen with a similar slope of −8 km s−1 kpc deg−1 ,
which is predicted for stars with orbits trapped at the CR of a slow bar in the model of Monari
et al. (2019b). The median VR shifts from positive to negative values at Rg ∼ 7.4 kpc (for φ = 0,
Lz ∼ 1700 km s−1 kpc). This transition may indicate the role of minor merge starts to take eﬀect
together with the contribution from the CR of the bar. The most outer undulation around Rg ∼ 8.7
kpc (for φ = 0, Lz ∼ 2100 km s−1 kpc) has a wide feature (three times larger than ridges), which
is probably also related to the minor merge event of the Galactic disk with Sgr dwarf galaxy, but
this remains an open question for further study in the future. Moreover, since the major merge
event by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus galaxy bring its metal-rich component (Zhao & Chen 2021),
and the accreted halo stars with special chemistry (Xing et al. 2019), into the solar neighborhood,
it is interesting to probe how major merge events take eﬀect on the existence of these ridges and
undulations. Finally, many moving groups exist in the solar neighborhood (Zhao et al. 2009), and it
is of high interest to probe if they may leave some imprints in the φ versus Lz plane coded by median
VR as the Hercules moving group.
