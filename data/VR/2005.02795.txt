Abstract 

With  advances in  Building  Information  Modeling  (BIM),  Virtual  Reality  (VR)  and  Augmented  Reality 

(AR)  technologies  have  many  potential  applications  in  the  Architecture,  Engineering,  and  Construction 

(AEC) industry. However, the AEC industry, relative to other industries, has been slow in adopting AR/VR 

technologies, partly due to lack of feasibility studies examining the actual cost of implementation versus an 

increase in profit. The main objectives of this paper are to understand the industry trends in adopting AR/VR 

technologies and identifying gaps between AEC research and industry practices. The identified gaps can 

lead  to  opportunities  for  developing  new  tools  and  finding  new  use  cases.  To  achieve  these  goals,  two 

rounds of a survey at two different time periods (a year apart) were conducted. Responses from 158 industry 

experts  and  researchers  were  analyzed  to  assess  the  current  state,  growth,  and  saving  opportunities  for 

AR/VR  technologies for the  AEC  industry.  The  authors  used t-test for  hypothesis testing.  The findings 

show a significant increase in AR/VR utilization in the AEC industry over the past year from 2017 to 2018. 

The industry experts also anticipate strong growth in the use of AR/VR technologies over the next 5 to 10 

years.

Introduction 

One of the largest industries in the United States is the AEC industry with expenditure reaching over $1.162 

trillion in 2017 (Statista 2017). Over 98% of construction projects incur cost overruns and delays (Changali 

et al. 2015). Many projects experience rework, costing 5% to 20% of the total contract value (Forcada et 

al. 2017). The main causes of rework include lack of communication among different construction parties, 

lack of adequate visualization capability to recognize design conflicts, and lack of support for advanced 

communication  technologies  (Fayek  et  al.  2003;  Gamil  and  Abdul  Rahman  2018).  Addressing  these 

deficiencies can decrease the number of unforeseen issues and, therefore, rework in construction projects 

(Gamil and Abdul Rahman 2018). 

Over the past decade, BIM has found a wide range of applications in the AEC industry (Noghabaei 

et al. 2019, 2020; Noghabaei and Han 2020; O’Neill et al. 2020; Sherafat et al. 2019b; a, 2020; Volk et al. 

2014; Yalcinkaya and Singh 2015). In this paper, BIM is defined as the process of generating and involving 

digital representation of a building or construction and their characteristics. BIM is not just the production 

of  3D  models  (Chong  et  al.  2016)  therefore  it  can  be  used  for  different  functions  such  as,  improving 

communication,  decision  making  enhancement,  and  visualization.  Furthermore,  BIM  can  accelerate 

information  integration  form  design  to  construction  (Liao  and  Ai  Lin  Teo  2018).  BIM  technology  has 

improved and revolutionized the way designers, engineers, and managers think about the buildings and 

enables  them  to  predict  and  solve  problems  that  might  occur  during  the  life-cycle  of  a  building.  BIM 

technology  has  enabled  designers  and  engineers  to  detect  clashes  and  simulate  different  construction 

scenarios for more efficient decision making. BIM technology revolutionized the AEC industry in many 

different  aspects,  such  as  technical  aspects,  knowledge  management,  standardization,  and  diversity 

management  (Ghaffarianhoseini  et  al.  2017).  However,  BIM  still  has  some  inherent  shortcomings.  For 

instance, BIM does not provide robust visualization for cluttered construction sites and the existing software 

packages  provide  limited  user  experiences  (i.e.,  lack  of  interactive  visualization  using  a  keyboard  and 

2 

 
mouse)  (Du  et  al.  2018).  In  addition,  the  other  challenge  in  many  construction  projects  lies  within 

interoperability of BIM tools and IFC (McCuen et al. 2012). Moreover, investigations have shown that BIM 

has some limitations in real-time on-site communication (Wang et al. 2013). Additionally, the stakeholders 

who  are  not  familiar  with  BIM  solutions  are  not  able  to  utilize  its  capabilities,  such  as  improved 

communication  through visualization.  Finally,  BIM  does  not  provide sense  of realism  while  immersive 

virtual  mock-ups  with  a  one-to-one  scale  can  create  improved  interaction  with  BIM  which  results  in 

improved communication at the end (Heydarian et al. 2015). 

To  address  some  of  the  inherent  deficiencies  of  BIM,  researchers  proposed  the  use  of  new 

technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). In this paper, AR is referred to a 

physical  environment,  whose  elements  are  augmented  with  and  supported  by  virtual  input  and  VR  is 

referred to a simulated virtual environment, representing a physical environment. Accordingly, Immersive 

Virtual  Environments  (IVEs)  are  environments  where  user  interaction  is  supported  within  a  virtual 

environment. AR/VR technologies can potentially address these deficiencies and enhance BIM in several 

aspects,  such  as  real-time  on-site  communication  (Wang  et  al.  2013).  AR/VR  can  also  improve 

communication  among stakeholders  and provide  better  visualization  for  engineers,  designers, and  other 

stakeholders, enabling one-to-one fully immersive experience (Biocca and Levy 2013). Furthermore, IVEs 

have the necessary potentials to achieve knowledge synthesis to improve design process  (Dossick et al. 

2015).  Despite  all  these  benefits,  the  AEC  industry  is  far  behind  other  industries  in  adopting  AR/VR 

technologies. 

Many industries implemented AR/VR in a successful way. For example, AR/VR has applications 

in manufacturing (Berg and Vance 2017; Choi et al. 2015), retail (Bonetti et al. 2018; Dacko 2017), mining 

(Pedram et al. 2017; Zhang 2017), education (Greenwald et al. 2017; Merchant et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 

2018)  and  healthcare,  especially  for  simulating  surgeries  (Atwal  et  al.  2014;  Khor  et  al.  2016;  de 

Ribaupierre  et  al.  2014).  Recent  studies  indicate  the  benefits  of  AR/VR  in  the  AEC  industry  by 

demonstrating potential applications, such as safety training (Li et al. 2018), visualization (Fogarty et al. 

2018;  Paes  et  al.  2017),  communication  (Du  et  al.  2018),  and  energy  management  (Niu  et  al.  2016).

Although research suggests AR/VR technologies can be very effective, the AEC industry has been very 

slow in adopting these technologies, which could be partly due to lack of feasibility, examining the actual 

cost of implementation versus an increase in profit.  

The main objective of this study is to understand the industry trends (growth pace) and limitations 

in adopting AR/VR technologies, as well as identifying new opportunities for leveraging AR/VR. Through 

a  set  of  comprehensive  survey,  the  authors  investigated  the  utilization  growth  of  AR/VR  technologies 

within the AEC industry. Furthermore, this paper aims to understand potential cost and time savings and 

find opportunities for AR/VR developments in order to improve communication and visualization among 

different  stakeholders.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  a  series  of  two  surveys  over  a  one  year  period  is 

conducted where over 150 AEC industry experts have provided their feedbacks and visions on growth and 

utilization of AR/VR technologies within the AEC industry.  

Literature Review 

In this section, the authors investigated the potentials and applications of AR/VR technologies in AEC and 

other domains such as, education, healthcare, mining industry, and retail industry. This comparison between 

AEC and other domains shows potential use cases of AR/VR in AEC industry. 

AR/VR in Other Domains 

Over the past decade, many researchers in different fields have investigated how AR/VR tools can enhance 

the communication of information among users. For instance, in the retail industry, Javornik (2016) and 

McCormick et al. (2014) demonstrated that AR/VR applications are rapidly evolving and increasingly used 

over  the  past  years.  Dacko  (2017)  quantitatively  analyzed  more  than  250  Mobile  Augmented  Reality 

(MAR) applications for shopping. The results demonstrated that MAR is beneficial (i.e., efficiency or better 

shopping value) to the retail industry and presented actions to leverage MAR for smart retail.  

In addition to the aforementioned industries, the mining industry is one of the pioneer industries in 

adopting  AR/VR  technologies.  Grabowski  and  Jankowski  (2015)  demonstrate  that  a  VR  solution  can 

enhance occupational health and safety of coal mining workers by presenting a pilot study. In this study, 

4 

 
the workers were trained by professionals who had adequate experience with safety training. They tested 

different motion capture systems, Head-Mounted Displays (HMD), joysticks as input methods, and training 

scenarios and compared the results. The results showed that VR technology can be a very effective platform, 

substitute on-site training, and prevent trainees from exposure to dangers and risks that are common in a 

mining  environment.  Zhang  (2017)  developed  a  VR-based  training  system  for  the  mining  industry  and 

demonstrated that having more immersion using devices like magic leap can improve the training systems. 

Pedram et al. (2017) evaluated the VR-based safety training systems and concluded these systems have a 

positive learning experience.  

AR/VR technologies have been receiving much attention in  the  healthcare industry due to their 

immersion capabilities. Mosadeghi et al. (2016) conducted a case study with over 500 hospital patients. 

The patients viewed VR simulations such as ocean exploration and tour of Iceland to reduce the stress level. 

Then, they conducted a survey on anxiety and pain level. The results demonstrated that most of the inpatient 

users expressed that VR experience was pleasant and it was capable of reducing pain and anxiety. Tashjian 

et al. (2017) designed a similar experiment with 50 patients. Patients viewed a 15-minute VR simulation 

called Pain RelieVR. This simulation designed in a way that can reduce the stress through a game-like 

experience. They monitored the heart rate and blood pressure of the patients during the experiment. The 

results  of  this  experiment  indicate  that  VR  can  significantly  reduce  pain  versus  traditional  control 

distraction condition. Dascal et al. (2017) reviewed the applications of VR in healthcare industry between 

2005  and  2015  and  concluded  that  VR  has  shown  more  success  in  three  areas:  eating  disorders,  pain 

management, and cognitive and motor rehabilitation. In addition, Pelargos et al. (2017) investigated the 

potentials of using AR/VR in neurosurgery. They concluded that healthcare industry needs more AR/VR 

tools for educational purposes. 

There are also many researchers in education who have investigated AR/VR technology. Akçayır 

and  Akçayır  (2017)  presented  a  comprehensive  review  of  usage,  challenges,  and  advantages  of  AR 

technology in the education industry. They determined that AR can enhance learning achievements and 

motivate students. Potkonjak et al. (2016) show the growth in online education and distant-learning that 

5 

 
uses IVE. Wei et al. (2015) developed an AR-based teaching system. They showed that teaching using their 

AR-based application increases student motivation and improves the innovation and creativity of the design 

outputs in a design course. Nikolic et al. (2009) developed a VR-based tool that is proved to be a reliable 

and effective solution to the challenges faced by students in visualizing 3D structures. It allows students to 

visualize and review various designs through a VR environment. The efficiency and usefulness of the tool 

were assessed by surveys, group interviews, and in-class exercises. The results showed that subjects had a 

far better understanding of concepts when using a VR interface. 

AR/VR in AEC 

Usage  of  AR/VR technologies  in other fields  such  as  healthcare,  education,  and  retail  has  shown  to  be 

useful for improving human behavior, student learning enhancement, increasing revenues in retailing. The 

other fields are growing in this area and also recently, AEC has grown too, but more in some specific areas 

and not across the entire industry mainly because of lack of budget in the industry and as a result, AEC 

industry has not adopted these tools, but it is possible to improve budget and enhance scheduling if AR/VR 

are effectively used. 

Utilization of IVEs in an engaging experience for end-users in project design process, and 

combining  IVEs  sense  of  presence  and  BIM  models  can  enhance  the  opportunity  to  evaluate 

different alternative design options in a time and cost efficient approach.  

The AEC industry has many potential use cases for utilizing AR/VR technologies such as, safety 

training, improving BIM visualization and communication, BIM-based immersive tools, energy savings, 

and understanding end-users (occupants) preferences. Li (2018) performed a case-study on personalized 

safety training in an IVE in order to achieve more efficient safety training with better results. Sacks et al. 

(2013) conducted a research study to evaluate the long-term effect of VR safety training in comparison to 

the traditional approaches. They performed an experiment with two groups of 30 respondents. They gave a 

VR-based training to the first group while the second group has gone through the traditional safety training 

program. The results of the study indicated that the VR-based safety training program is significantly more 

6 

 
effective than the traditional approach in both short term and long term. Le et al. (2015) developed an online 

VR framework that enables workers to perform dialogic learning, role-playing, and social interaction to 

provide better safety and health education for the workers. They concluded that the platform effectively 

improves  health  and  safety  education.  Jeelani  et  al.  (2017)  developed  a training  strategy  that  simulated 

construction  accidents  in  the  VR  environment to  demonstrate  accident causation  and  the  importance  of 

thorough hazard recognition and proper risk perception. After training, the workers were able to identify 

more hazards, perceive them with a higher level of risk and were able to use effective management strategies 

to control the hazards concluding that VR environments provide a high degree of realism which improves 

training outcomes. 

Balali et al. (2018) developed a framework for cost estimation in construction using VR technology. 

They  used  a  real-time  VR  model  that  can  give  the  stakeholders  and  the  users  the  ability  to  change  the 

material of the walls, floors and other parts and the model  provides them the price  impact  in real-time. 

Linking cost estimation to VR can be beneficial to the AEC industry, especially to estimators. Du et al. 

(2018) introduced a cloud-based VR system called CoVR to improve communication among stakeholders 

in a construction project. CoVR is able to import BIM data and visualize it in a multiuser interactive virtual 

environment. This platform enables remote stakeholders to have social and face-to-face interaction with 

others. The researchers conducted a survey on CoVR and the results demonstrated that CoVR can enhance 

communication. Williams et al. (2015) developed an MAR application that can augment BIM models on 

top  of  the  real  world  building.  This  application  has  the  potentials  to  help  technicians  to  optimize  and 

visualize their model and data promptly in an AR application.  

Some researchers used IVE to develop interactive training environment for workers, technicians, 

and engineers. Goulding et al. (2012) introduced a VR-based interactive environment that enables a user to 

interact with triggered problems on a construction site and make decisions. They can see how their decisions 

affect project cost and schedule. The respondents of this study were interested in the tools and believed that 

VR provided better interaction and improved the decision making. Fang and Cho (2016) developed a virtual 

prototyping platform to improve crane safety. In this platform, a lift crew, consisting of a planner, rigger, 

7 

 
 
signalman, and operators, virtually perform lifting operations. The results indicate that this tool can improve 

the operator’s confidence and safety. Kayhani et al. (2018) developed a VR platform that can simulate the 

heavy mobile crane lift in a modular construction. This platform enables the lift crew and engineers simulate 

the  lift  in  an  IVE  and  evaluate  different  options  in  real-time.  This  platform  can  simplify  the  heavy  lift 

planning, improve the lift crew’s performance on the construction site, and reduce human error. 

Furthermore, some studies used IVE for improving the degree of presence in lighting condition 

assessment and energy management (Birt et al. 2017; Kuliga et al. 2015). Niu et al. (2016) developed a 

design  approach  combining  VR  and  design  with  an  intent  concept  that  can  help  in  closing  energy 

performance gap caused by occupants’ behavior. The results indicate that the developed framework can 

help designers detect design patterns that can predict actual occupant behaviors. Heydarian et al. (2015b) 

conducted an experiment to compare the respondents’ sense of presence in a VR environment versus a real 

environment.  A  realistic  model  of  a  room  with  different  lighting  options  was  created.  The  respondents 

selected similar options in VR versus real room. The results showed that VR is effective in obtaining user 

feedback. The feedback can improve the end-user satisfaction rate and performance in design (Heydarian 

et al. 2017). In another IVE study, Heydarian et al. (2016) evaluated how psychological factors such as 

defaults  and  personality  traits  may  influence  occupant’s  lighting  and  shading  interactions;  through 

collecting data from over 150 participants, they concluded that without any additional cost, defaults can be 

used to significantly reduce the lighting electricity consumption in commercial buildings.    

Method 

Since the implementation of AR/VR technologies is still relatively new in AEC industry, there is not much 

empirical  data  on  these  topics.  In  order  to  gather  data,  the  authors  came  up  with  a  number  of  research 

methods.  First,  the  authors  designed  a  detailed  online  questionnaire.  The  detailed  questionnaire  was 

reviewed by three BIM specialists as well as three researchers within the field of construction engineering 

and management to ensure questions are clear and not misleading. The authors designed the questionnaire 

in a way to be able to analyze the growth of these technologies by collecting responses at two different time 

8 

 
periods. Finally, by further analysis on the survey results, the authors were determine the industry trends 

and visions over AR/VR technologies. 

The questionnaire is formulated to gather the information about the AEC industry’s adoption of 

AR/VR  technologies  over  the  past  year.  Moreover,  the  questionnaire  investigated  the  opportunities  for 

AR/VR technologies to improve stakeholders’  communication and identify experts’ predicted return on 

investment.  The  questionnaire  is  designed  to  analyze  the  growth  of  these  technologies  by  collecting 

responses at two different time periods – once in spring 2017 and again in spring 2018. The online surveys 

were hosted on https://new.qualtrics.com/. Qualtrics enabled the authors to keep a record of the computer 

address  from  which  the  survey  was  completed  using  internet  protocol  (IP)  and  assign  an  identification 

number (ID) to the user’s IP. Qualtrics excluded duplicated data by checking respondents’ profiles, IPs, 

IDs, and entries from database for analyzing survey results. The excluded responses were mainly from the 

respondents who didn’t complete the survey so that the authors could not accredit their credibility for the 

goals of this research.  

As a first step, a set of 27 survey questions were designed to target a range of AEC professionals, 

such as engineers, designers, researchers, managers, and owners. The survey questions were divided into 

five  sections:  1)  general  information,  2)  company  related  information,  3)  BIM  knowledge,  4)  general 

AR/VR  related  information,  and  5)  visions  for  future  of  AR/VR.  The  first  three  sections  capture  the 

background and experience of the respondents. Then, AR/VR is evaluated in the next two sections. Table 

1. Description of target areas and objectives with respect to different parts of the survey describes the main 

sections, gathered data, and the objective of each section in more detail.

evaluation 

The first and second rounds of the survey had 94 and 64 respondents, respectively. The surveys 

were distributed directly among professionals within the AEC industry and also through the Construction 

Management  Association  of  America (CMAA)  organization.  CMAA  was  chosen  since  it  is  has  a  great 

combination of 16000 members in AEC industry from both public and private sectors across the USA. 

CMAA  expert  members  are  from  different  parties  such  as  owners,  architects  and  designers,  general 

contractors,  and  construction  managers.  Since  CMAA  has  this  wide  range  of  members  from  different 

parties, the authors decided to use CMAA for distributing the surveys. The authors conducted the first round 

of survey in March through May 2017 and the second round in January through March 2018. The surveys 

were distributed in two rounds to measure the impact and growth of AR/VR in the AEC industry and enable 

the realistic evaluation of the current state of AR/VR.  

The first section of the survey attempts to identify the general information of the respondents, such 

as age, gender, occupation, and professional experience. In the next section, the respondents answer several 

questions about their companies, such as geographical location, size, and type of projects (e.g., residential 

commercial,  institutional,  etc.).  The  third  section  examines  the  respondents’  competency  in  BIM 

technology and applications (i.e. quality control, progress monitoring).  

In the next two sections, the survey results assessing AR/VR utilization in the AEC industry as well 

as the future opportunities for AR/VR applications are presented. First, the respondents are asked what 

types  of  AR/VR  devices  they  have  used  and  how  many  AR/VR  experts  they  have  in  their  companies. 

10 

 
 
Through these questions, the authors were able to evaluate the respondents’ familiarity with AR/VR tools 

and their companies’ effort in integrating these technologies with on-going and future projects. In the last 

section, the respondents were asked to answer a few questions about their vision on the future integration 

of AR/VR technologies within the AEC industry. The questions in this section were designed in a way that 

demonstrates  AR/VR  potentials  for  future  developments.  For  example,  the  respondents  were  asked  to 

identify  the  sectors  (i.e.,  education  and  healthcare  facilities)  and  the  project  size  that  can  best  leverage 

AR/VR  technology.  The last  section  evaluated the  visions  for  cost  and  time  saving  through  integrating 

AR/VR  technologies  in  construction  projects.  The  last  two  questions  evaluate  how  the  respondents 

predicted the increase in end-users satisfaction when AR/VR technology is used and their limitations in 

AEC-related applications. By understanding the potential and maturity of AR/VR technologies, industry 

leaders can better understand the potential use-case of these tools. The identified industry trends can help 

industry leaders make better investment decisions on these technologies. 

Survey Findings and Results 

In this section, the survey responses are analyzed to (1) understand the current state and growth of AR/VR 

in the AEC industry over the past year, (2) identify opportunities of AR/VR development in improving 

communication and visualization, and (3) understand the benefits, that are foreseen by AEC practitioners, 

of adopting AR/VR technologies.  

In order to account for participant privacy, the surveys did not ask for any personal information 

such as, name, company name, and etc. from the participants. To detect whether participants took part in 

both rounds, the authors added a question to the second survey asking the participants whether they had 

participated in the same survey study previously. The results for this question demonstrated that none of 

the participants in the second round of survey participated in the first round. The survey results are analyzed 

as follow to understand these trends.

General Respondent Information 

Overall in both surveys, 71% (67% and 77% respectively in each survey) of the respondents were male and 

29% were female (33% and 23% respectively in each survey). Respondent’s age ranged from 25 to 60 with 

the  average  of  32  overall  in  both  surveys.  Approximately,  70%  of  the  respondents  (78  out  of  114 

respondents who were willing to share their age) were 30 years old or younger. Respondents were also 

asked about their roles in the AEC industry. The survey had four groups and the result is summarized in

The professional experience is another important indicator of the expertise of the respondents. Most 

of the respondents with expertise in BIM and AR/VR technologies were relatively young. Overall in both 

surveys,  approximately  75%  of the  respondents  indicated  that they  had  10  years  or less  of professional 

experience in the AEC industry. Fig. 1 shows the number of years the respondents have spent at their current 

companies and Fig. 2 presents how many years they have worked in the AEC industry.

Company Related Information 

The overall distribution of the respondents is shown in the following heat map (Fig. 3). Darker areas are 

places with more respondents. Among the respondents with AR/VR experience, California had the highest 

rate,  51%, of participation (22  out of 43 respondents with high  level  of  AR/VR  experience).  After that 

Illinois was the second highest rate, 12% (5 out of 43 respondents with high level of AR/VR experience). 

The third state was New York with 9% (4 out of 43 respondents with high level of AR/VR experience).  

Fig. 3. Companies’ locations 

The numbers of employees and project values can be used to infer the size of a company, which 

can help determine how companies with different sizes envision the future of the AR/VR technologies. As 

Table 33 demonstrates, 17% of overall respondents were currently working at companies with more than 

5000 employees (14% in survey 1 and  21% in survey 2),  26% were in  1000-5000 employees company

survey 2), and 36% were less than 200 employees company (40% survey 1 and 29% survey 2). Participants 

working for the AEC industry (excluding researchers) were also asked to identify what type of project(s) 

they were mainly involved with based on the average project cost (i.e., >$100 million, $10 - $50 million, 

etc.). As Table 44 shows, approximately 45% of participants were working on projects > $10 million in 

value and 50% on projects less than $5 million. It is important to note that participants had the option of 

choosing more than one answer for this question.

The respondents had a wide variety of project types. The project types are divided into five different 

sectors, such as residential, commercial, institutional, transportation, and industrial (Fig. 4). Approximately 

60% of the participants indicated they are involved with vertical projects and 15% working on horizontal 

projects. Combining the result from this question and other questions (i.e., the number of VR experts), can 

demonstrate the growth and adoption of AR/VR technologies in these sectors.

BIM Knowledge and Experience  

To  assess  BIM  knowledge  of  the  respondents,  several  questions  related  to  BIM  were  asked.  The  first 

question was about the BIM usage level. More than 75% of the respondents answered that they use BIM 

tools at least once a month. In addition, more than 90% of the engineers use BIM on a monthly basis. High 

usage of BIM among engineers demonstrates the importance of this technology for the industry. Fig. 5 

shows the BIM usage rate for the respondents.

The second question in this section was about the experience of the respondents with BIM tools. 

86% of the respondents expressed that they have had some experience with BIM tools and only 14% of the 

respondents have never used any BIM tool at all. Among the respondents with no BIM experience, 63% 

were engineers, 16% were managers, and 22% were researchers. The results show, although AEC research 

strongly recommends BIM, still many engineers have not used and were never trained to use any BIM tools.

The last question in this section was about applications of BIM used by the respondents. The top 

three applications of BIM were clash detection, model validation, and visualization and trade coordination. 

Using  BIM  for  facility  management  purposes,  energy  and  light  simulations,  transportation,  and  cost 

estimation were the least options that were chosen by the respondents. Although there were several BIM 

tools available in the aforementioned areas, the adoptions of BIM tools in these areas were significantly 

lower as shown in Fig. 7. However, the deficiency of BIM in these areas means more room for potential 

applications of AR/VR technologies.

AR/VR Knowledge and Experience  

This  section  evaluates  the  adoption  of  AR/VR  technologies  in  the  AEC  industry  over  the  past  year  by 

comparing the result of the first round of the survey with the result of the second round. In each survey, the 

respondents were asked about their familiarity with AR/VR equipment and whether they have  used any 

related tools. As shown in Fig. 8, there has been a significant increase in respondents’ familiarity and use 

of AR/VR tools from the first survey to the second survey. This growth indicates that companies and AEC 

professionals are becoming more familiar and interested in adopting AR/VR tools. 

16 

 
 
 
Fig. 8 shows how many of the respondents used AR/VR devices and applications in general. The survey 

made it clear that in this question, AR/VR is not only for the AEC industry, however, the survey made it 

clear that the “use” is only for the AEC industry in Figures 13, 14 and 15 further represents how these tools 

are being or will be used with the AEC industry

expertise and understanding categories, respectively, between the two surveys. This growth indicates there 

has  been  a  significant  increase  in  integration  of  AR/VR  tools  within  AEC  projects,  where  industry 

professionals are more exposed to these tools and have a better understanding of their capabilities.

Respondents were also asked about which VR devices they are more familiar with and recommend 

to be used. The results of both surveys indicate that respondents are most familiar with and recommend 

Oculus  Rift  (approximately  45%),  followed  by  HTC  Vive,  Samsung  Gear,  and  Microsoft  HoloLens. 

Comparing the results of first and second surveys, respondents’ significantly increased recommending the 

use of HTC Vive as well as slight increase in Microsoft HoloLens. Consequently, recommendations for

companies. As it is shown in Fig. 11, more employees are becoming familiar with AR/VR tools among the 

respondents’ companies. This result may also indicate that the industry is adopting AR/VR technologies at 

a fast pace.

Visions of the Future AR/VR 

This section was designed to determine the opportunities of AR/VR in the AEC industry. Respondents were 

asked to predict whether AR/VR will be used on all or majority of the projects within the next 5 to 10 years. 

More than 70% of all respondents chose “probably yes” or “definitely yes,” indicating a significant increase 

in the adoption of AR/VR technologies. In addition, over the past year, the percentage of “definitely yes” 

and “probably yes” increased by 14%, indicating a rapid and positive change in the industry trend. Fig. 12 

presents respondents’ predictions on the AR/VR usage in the AEC industry for the next 5 to 10 years.

The respondents were also asked to identify the limitations of AR/VR technologies; 21% of the 

respondents mentioned that lack of budget, 17% indicated upper management’s lack of understanding of 

these technologies, and 17% of the respondents mentioned design teams’ lack of knowledge as the main 

limitation  for  AR/VR  utilization.  Fig.  16  presents  this  result.  Addressing  these  limitations  can  further 

increase the adoption of AR/VR technologies in the AEC industry.

The last question of this section asked respondents for their estimate of time and cost savings (if 

any) in different phases of a project by adopting AR/VR technologies. The respondents’ options for this 

20 

 
 
 
question  were  based  on  the  savings in terms of the  project cost  percentage.  Approximately  55%  of  the 

respondents predicted more than 1% savings can be achieved by integrating VR/AR tools during the design 

and construction phases. Over 60% predicted savings of 1% during the operation phase. Fig. 17 shows the 

result in the design and construction phases. Fig. 18 shows the operation phase.

Discussion and Analysis  

This section further discusses the survey results and how the results were analyzed. The main softwares 

that  the  author  used  were  IBM  SPSS  and  Excel.  Furthermore,  the  authors  mainly  used  unpaired  t-test 

hypothesis testing in this section.  

To  measure  the  growth  of  confidence  level  of  the  respondents,  the  respondents’  prediction  on 

whether or not AR/VR technologies will be used on the majority of the projects within the next 5 to 10 

years was analyzed. The result from unpaired t-test indicates that there was a significant difference in the 

scores (definitely not=0, probably not=1, might or might not=2, probably yes=3, definitely yes=4) of this 

question  for  first  survey  (M=2.63,  SD=1.13)  and  second  survey  (M=3.20,  SD=0.76);  p  =  0.001.  These 

21 

 
 
 
results  suggest  that  the  confidence  level  of  respondents  about  the  future  of  AR/VR  technologies  in  the 

second survey are significantly higher than respondents in the first survey. This means that the AEC experts 

are paying more attention toward the AR/VR technologies. The increase in the number of employees with 

some level of expertise in AR/VR technologies between the two surveys also supports this finding.  

In addition, although it seems that respondents who are relatively younger (i.e., less than 35 years 

old) believe that AR/VR technologies will be used on the majority of the projects within the next 5 to 10 

years,  the  survey  results  indicate  that  older  generations  are  more  confident  about  the  future  of  these 

technologies. The number of participants who are relatively young (less than 35 years old) is 78 and the 

participants  from  the  older  generations  had  a  total  number  of  36.  The  rest  of  the  participants  were  not 

interested in sharing their age so the authors ignored their answers for this analysis. These numbers shows 

that  the  authors  had  large  enough  samples  to  assume  that  the  distribution  of  the  data  was  normal.  An 

unpaired t-test was conducted to compare younger (younger than 35 years old) and older (older than 35 

years old) generations’ idea about the future of AR/VR. There was a significant difference in the scores for 

younger  generations  (M=2.86,  SD=1.01)  and  older  generations  (M=3.29,  SD=0.77);  p  =  0.025.  These 

results  suggest  that  older  generations’  positive  beliefs  about  the  future  of  AR/VR  technologies  are 

significantly higher than younger generations.  

Moreover, the increase in the number of employees with some level of AR/VR expertise indicates 

the growth in utilization of such technologies. Performing unpaired t-test on survey data shows that there 

was a significant difference in the number of employees with some levels of AR/VR expertise between the 

first  survey  (M=1.24,  SD=2.99)  and  the  second  survey  (M=3.55,  SD=0.65);  p  =  0.015.  These  results 

suggest that there was a significant increase in employees becoming familiar with these technologies over 

the past year. Moreover, the authors used unpaired t-test and investigated the growth in employees expertise 

and  there  was  a  significant  difference  in  the  scores  (hardly  at  all=0,  not  very  well=1,  average=2,  very 

well=3,  extremely  well=4)  of  AR/VR  for  the  first  survey  (M=0.64,  SD=1.18)  and  the  second  survey 

(M=1.27, SD=1.51); p = 0.009. These results demonstrate that AR/VR related expertise of the respondents 

in the second survey was significantly improved compared to the first survey. Using unpaired t-test and 

22 

 
dividing the companies into two groups of small companies (less than 1000 employees) and big companies 

(more than 1000 employees) shows that there was a significant difference between the number of AR/VR 

experts for the small companies (M=1.44, SD=3.69) and the big companies (M=2.81, SD=5.56); p = 0.07. 

This suggests that bigger companies are using these technologies more than small companies. 

To  show  the  prediction  of  AEC  experts  about  the  potential  savings  of  AR/VR,  the  authors 

performed  an  unpaired  t-test  on  the  results  from  the  last  two  question  of  the  survey.  Unpaired  t-test 

demonstrates that there was a significant difference in the potential cost and time savings score (percentage 

of entire project value) in design, construction, and operation by utilizing AR/VR. The results for the first 

survey (M=3.21, SD=6.7) and the second survey (M=4.17, SD=10.97), p = 0.049 suggest that respondents’ 

prediction about savings through AR/VR was significantly increased in the second survey. Also, unpaired 

t-test shows that there was a significant difference in the potential predicted savings scores of AR/VR from 

respondents with no BIM experience (M=2.90, SD=2.94) and BIM experts (M=3.80, SD=2.71); p = 0.033. 

These  results  suggest  that  respondents  with  higher  BIM  experience  predict  significantly  more  savings 

through AR/VR compared to respondents with no BIM experience.  

Using the survey results, lack of budget, lack of understanding of upper management about AR/VR 

technologies, and lack of knowledge of design teams were the top three reported limitations for utilizing 

AR/VR technologies. Also, an unpaired t-test on the survey results indicates that there was a significant 

difference  in  the  AR/VR  expertise  between  engineers  (M=0.76,  SD=1.19)  and  managers  (M=1.34, 

SD=2.71);  p  =  0.033.  These  results  suggest  that  although managers  seem  not  experienced  with  AR/VR 

related technologies, they are significantly more experienced than the engineers. This suggests that the AEC 

industry  needs  more  AR/VR  experts  to  fill  this  gap  and  overcome  the  limitations  of  utilizing  AR/VR 

technologies.  Additionally,  15%  of  respondents  identified  the  lack  of  communication  among  software 

platform as one of the in survey 1; however, this number was significantly reduced (by 3%) in survey 2, 

indicating that algorithms and plugins are being developed that have improved this limitation. Furthermore, 

the data does not show any more significant results by analyzing, gender, occupation, company location, 

and company project type.  

23 

 
Although  AEC  industry  is  far  behind  other  industries  such  as  healthcare  and  retail  in  adopting 

AR/VR technologies in research literature, the results of this study showed that AEC industry is changing 

its previous path and therefore it is utilizing these technologies more than before. In addition this study 

determined the main limitations for AEC industry to adopt these technologies as well as revealing the areas 

that show more promises for the industry. This article also presented how different parties in AEC envisions 

future of AR/VR technologies as well as savings that can be achieved using AR/VR technologies. 

Conclusions and Future Vision  

This paper presents two rounds of a survey that were conducted at two different time periods with about a 

year part. The results were analyzed to assess the current state, growth, and saving opportunities for AR/VR 

technologies in the AEC industry. The results of the surveys show that the industry experts foresee a strong 

growth in the  use  of  AR/VR  technologies  over the next 5  to  10  years.  Furthermore,  the results  show  a 

significant increase in AR/VR utilization in the AEC industry over the past year and potential opportunities.  

The surveys show some inherent limitations in adopting new AR/VR technologies, such as lack of 

budget, upper management’s lack of understanding of these technologies, design teams’ lack of knowledge. 

Due to lower profit margins on construction projects, one major limiting factor that prevents the industry 

from  adopting  AR/VR  technologies  is  the  lack  of  availability  of  cost/benefit  analysis.  Owners  and 

companies are not willing to invest their money without knowing the true costs and benefits (i.e., time and 

cost savings). Therefore, there is a need for empirical studies that assess the true costs of implementing 

these technologies and reduction in costs and time from design to operation and maintenance phases. With 

regards to the other two major limitations, the results show that within the one year period between the two 

surveys,  the  number  of  people  within  the  respondents’  companies  that  are  familiar  with  AR/VR 

technologies has significantly increased; this may indicate that upper management and designers/engineers 

will become more familiar with the capabilities of these tools in the near future as these tools become more 

accessible to the general consumer.  

24 

 
Although this paper focuses on the benefits of both the AR and VR technologies, a more detailed 

study is required to better identify the benefits of each technology within the AEC industry. For instance, 

the survey results indicate that these technologies can be very effective for model visualization, validation, 

and clash detection, which are tasks related to pre-construction. However, with recent  advancements in 

mobile augmented reality and machine learning, it is expected that AR head-mounted displays provide a 

better assistant  to  project teams  during the construction  phase  (e.g.,  real-time safety  feedback,  progress 

monitoring)  or  facility  managers  during  the  operation  phase  (e.g.,  sensor  data  visualization,  energy 

simulations) in comparison to VR tools. 

Although respondents indicated that communication among software has improved within the past 

year, there still exists a number of limitations that can improve the capabilities of VR/AR technologies for 

AEC professionals. For instance, there is no robust approach for transferring all BIM information along 

with cost data into VR platform. Importing BIM models into a 3D engine is a challenge because some of 

the  building  information  (i.e.,  material  library)  might  be  lost  during  the  export  and  import  process. 

Moreover, connecting several VR headsets to enable a group meeting in a virtual space can enhance and 

improve communications among stakeholders. These problems have to be solved in order to convince the 

AEC industry to spend more money on the development and adoption in this area.
