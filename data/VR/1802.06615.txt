Abstract Based on the high resolution spectral monitoring conducted at the 6-m BTA tele-
scope, we study the optical spectrum of the high-latitude variable V534 Lyr. Heliocentric
radial velocities Vr corresponding to the positions of all metal absorption components, as
well as the Na I D and Hα lines were measured during all the observational dates. The
analysis of the velocity ﬁeld examining the lines of various nature revealed a low-amplitude
variability of Vr based on the lines with a high excitation potential, which are formed in
deep layers of the stellar atmosphere, and allowed to estimate the systemic velocity of
Vsys ≈ −125 km s−1 (Vlsr ≈ −105 km s−1). The distance estimate of d ≈ 6 kpc for the
star leads us to its absolute magnitude of MV ≈ −5.m3, what corresponds to the MK
spectral classiﬁcation. The previously undetected for this star spectral phenomenon was
revealed: at certain times a splitting of the proﬁles of low-excited absorptions is observed,
reaching ∆Vr = 20–50 km s−1. A combination of the parameters: reduced metallicity
[Met/H]⊙ = −0.28, increased nitrogen abundance [N/Fe] = +1.10, large spatial veloc-
ity, high luminosity, a strong variability of the emission-absorption proﬁles of H I lines,
splitting of metal absorptions at diﬀerent times of observations and the variability of the
velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere allow us to classify V534 Lyr as a pulsating star near the
HB and belonging to the thick disk of our Galaxy.
Keywords: stars, evolution, post-AGB stars, pulsating stars, optical spectroscopy.

1. Introduction

During the past two decades, the 6-meter telescope BTA hosts an investigation of the spectra
of numerous supergiants with a large excess of IR-radiation, presumably belonging to the stage
of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB. The program also includes a study of
some related stars with an unclear evolutionary status. At the post-AGB stage, far evolved
intermediate-mass stars are observed, with initial masses at the main sequence 2 ÷ 9M⊙.
Before the AGB stage, these stars are cool (with eﬀective temperature of Teﬀ ≈ 3000–5000 K)
red supergiants. After they have exhausted helium, a degenerate carbon-oxygen core is formed
in the core of AGB stars with an initial mass between 2–4 M⊙. This core is surrounded by
alternately energetically active layers of He and H combustion. Most of the time, the hydrogen
layer provides the energy release, but as the products of hydrogen burning join the helium

layer, a brief ignition of helium occurs in the latter. This conﬁguration of the internal structure
of the star is unstable, the theory predicts a fairly eﬀective mixing and dredge-up (due to the
penetrating convection) of heavy metals synthesized in nuclear reactions, accompanying these
processes of energy release into the atmosphere of the star (see the survey [1] and references
therein).

Our initial goal was to determine the fundamental parameters of investigated stars and to
search for the chemical composition anomalies in their atmospheres, related with the synthesis
of chemical elements during the previous evolutionary stages. As the program runs, additional
research became crucial, aimed to search for the time variability of spectral features and the
velocity ﬁelds in the atmospheres and envelopes of studied stars. This expansion of the task
required conducting for each program object of multiple observations with high spectral reso-
lution in a broad wavelength range. The main results we have obtained from the spectroscopic
data at the 6-m telescope are summarized in a number of recent publications [2, 3, 4]. Let
us brieﬂy note the most important of them. Firstly, the parameters and chemical composition
of the atmospheres for several tens of stars with an excess in infrared ﬂux were determined.
Secondly, evolutionary variations in chemical composition (a large excess of the s-process or
hot-bottom-process elements) were found for seven stars [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Based on the repre-
sentative sample of stars, studied by us and the authors of [10], we formed a subsample of
post-AGB stars with the atmospheres rich in the s-process carbon and heavy metals, and with
the carbon-rich circumstellar envelopes. The analysis of properties of this subsample led us to
the conclusion on the interrelation of the peculiarity of line proﬁles, manifested in the presence
of the emission component of the Na I doublet D lines, in the character of molecular features,
asymmetry, permitted or forbidden metal emissions, formed in the envelopes, and in the split-
ting of strong absorption proﬁles with a low lower-level excitation potential, with kinematic
and chemical properties of the circumstellar envelope and with the type of its morphology [2].
The presence of the above-mentioned features is the main diﬀerence of the spectra of post-
AGB stars from the spectra of massive supergiants. The splitting into the components of the
proﬁles of strongest heavy-metal absorptions in the spectra of selected post-AGB supergiants we
have detected allowed us to conclude that the process of formation of a structured circumstellar
envelope is accompanied with an enrichment by the products of stellar nucleosynthesis [3].
Variability of the observed proﬁles of the absorption-emission Hα line and metal lines, as well
as the type change (absorption/emission) of the C2 molecule Swan bands registered in several
objects are caused by the variations of the parameters or the structure of the circumstellar
envelope. The Hα proﬁle type (pure absorption, pure emission, P Cyg or inverse P Cyg-type,
with two emission components in the wings) is not related to the chemical composition of
the atmosphere of the central star. The main factors inﬂuencing the Hα proﬁle type and its
variability are the mass loss rate, the velocity of stellar wind, kinematics and optical thickness
of the envelope.

We have discovered the peculiarities, previously unknown in the optical spectra of the AGB-
candidate stars. In particular, based on the observations, also performed with the NES echelle
spectrograph of the 6-m telescope, the spectral features and the velocity ﬁelds in the atmosphere
and the envelope of the cool AGB-supergiant V1027 Cyg [11], the optical component of the
IR source IRAS 20004+2955 were studied. For the ﬁrst time, the spectrum of this star revealed
the splitting of the cores of strong metal absorptions and their ions (Si II, Ni I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II,
Cr I, Fe I, Fe II, Ba II). The broad proﬁle of these lines contains a stably located weak emission

in the core, the position of which can be considered as the velocity of the center of mass of the
system (for brevity, we shall further refer to it as the systemic velocity) Vsys = 5.5 km s−1. From
the symmetric small and moderate-intensity absorptions, weak radial velocity variations were
revealed with an amplitude of 5–6 km s−1, caused by pulsations. A red-wave Hα proﬁle shift was
observed, caused by the distortion of the line core. In the red spectral region, numerous weak
lines of the CN molecule and the K I 7696 ˚A line, which has a P Cyg-type proﬁle are identiﬁed.
An agreement of radial velocity, measured from the symmetric absorptions of metals and the CN
lines indicates formation of a CN spectrum in the atmosphere of the star. Numerous interstellar
bands, DIBs, were identiﬁed, the position of which in the spectrum, Vr(DIBs) = −12.0 km s−1,
corresponds to the velocity of the interstellar medium in the Local Arm of the Galaxy.

Absolutely new results were obtained for a nameless faint star [12], associated with a powerful
source of IR radiation RAFGL 5081. Its optical spectrum has been studied for the ﬁrst time
based on the long-term spectral monitoring with high spectral resolution. The estimates of
the spectral class of the star Sp ≈ G5–8 II and its eﬀective temperature Teﬀ ≈ 5400 K were
made. We detected a hard-to-explain spectral phenomenon: a splitting of the medium and low-
intensity proﬁles of stationary absorptions. Stationarity of absorptions eliminates the possibility
of explaining the double peaks owing to the spectral binarity of the star. Radial velocities for the
wind components of the Na I D lines and Hα line proﬁles reach −250 km s−1 and −600 km s−1
respectively. These proﬁles contain narrow components, the number, the depths and positions
of which vary with time. The time-variable multicomponent structure of the Na I D lines and
Hα line proﬁles indicates the heterogeneity and instability of the circumstellar envelope of
RAFGL 5081. According to the presence in the Na I (1) line proﬁles of the components with
the velocity of Vr(IS) = −65 km s−1, it is concluded that RAFGL 5081 is located behind the
Perseus Arm, i.e. not closer than 2 kpc. Note that this object is associated with a reﬂective
nebula GN 02.44.7. The problem of photometric monitoring for determining the variability
parameters of the central star RAFGL 5081 is set.

In the study of sources with a large IR ﬂux excess, we identiﬁed the stars outside the expected
AGB and post-AGB stages. It turned out that among such objects, in addition to AGB- and
post-AGB stars, there exist massive stars of extremely high luminosity with extended and struc-
tured circumstellar envelopes. The most famous object that has for many years been preferably
considered as a star in the post-AGB stage is V1302 Aql, which has numerous peculiarities in
the spectrum. For a long time, the evolutionary status of this supergiant, associated with a pow-
erful IR source IRC+10420, was unclear. The set of observed properties of V1302 Aql allowed
to consider it as a star at the post-AGB stage or as a very massive star, past the red supergiant
stage. It is obvious that depending on the accepted status, and hence on the luminosity of
the object too, the estimate of its distance from the observer may diﬀer several times. One
of the decisive arguments, conﬁrming the status of a massive evolved star for V1302 Aql was
obtained by us in the analysis of spectral data at the 6-m telescope when the chemical compo-
sition of its atmosphere was ﬁrst determined and a signiﬁcant excess of nitrogen was found [13].
Detection of a rapid growth of the eﬀective temperature [13, 14] allowed to assume that the
star quickly evolves with the Teﬀ increase rate of about 120 K a year. The phenomenon was for
us an incentive to continue the spectral monitoring of this mysterious object. In the study of
the V1302 Aql spectra over the period of observations of 1992–2014 the conclusion was drawn
that the yellow hypergiant entered the phase of deceleration (or the suspension) of growth of
the eﬀective temperature and approached at the H–R diagram the high-temperature boundary

of the Yellow Void [15]. It is appropriate to mention here the star HD 179821, which has for
several decades appeared in the papers as a post-AGB candidate, and only a detailed analysis
of the high-quality data of a long-term spectral monitoring with the echelle spectrographs of
the SAO RAS 6-m BTA telescope and the McDonald observatory 2.7-m telescope (USA) led
to the conclusion that it belonged to a family of massive evolved stars [16].

The experience obtained in the analysis of the spectra of stars of diﬀerent luminosity and
mass allows us to hope for a success in the study of stars with an obscure evolutionary status.
The object of the present study is the star V534 Lyr (HD 172324, HIP 91359), located at the
galactic latitude b = 18.◦58. Our interest to this relatively bright (V = 8.m16) star is due to the
fact that Trams et al. [17] included V534 Lyr in the list of high-luminosity stars at high Galactic
latitudes (HGL). These authors attributed the major part of investigated objects to the post-
AGB candidates. However, due to the lack of data on the IR ﬂux, they classiﬁed V534 Lyr only as
an alleged candidate in post-AGB. An additional stimulus to the study of V534 Lyr for us is the
emission in the H I lines, found in the early paper by Bonsack and Greenstein [18] and conﬁrmed
later [19]. This star was repeatedly studied using various photometric systems [20, 21, 22] and
spectral methods, but up to now, none of the available publications has a deﬁnite conclusion
on its evolutionary status (see Table 1, in which the basic papers examining V534 Lyr are
listed [23, 19, 24]).

The purpose of this paper is to determine the main parameters of V534 Lyr using the high-
quality optical spectral data, to search for the possible variability in time of the spectrum and
the pattern of radial velocities in the atmosphere of the star, and to reﬁne its evolutionary
status. Section 2 brieﬂy describes the used observational data and details of its processing.
The data on the spectral features obtained from the high-resolution spectra and the detected
proﬁle features are given in Section 3. We make an attempt here to apply our data for the
determination of luminosity, remoteness and evolutionary status of the star, as well as present
a method for determining the parameters of the stellar atmosphere and calculating the abun-
dances of chemical elements. Section 4 discusses the results of our study. The main conclusions
are summarized in the ﬁnal Section 5.

2. Observations and processing of spectra

In this study we used seven high-resolution spectra of V534 Lyr (R = 60 000), obtained with the
NES echelle spectrograph [25] of the 6-m BTA telescope on arbitrary dates in 2010 and 2017,
as well as the earliest of our spectra, which was obtained on July 8, 2000 with the PFES echelle
spectrograph installed in the primary focus of the 6-m telescope with a lower resolution of
R = 15 000 [26, 27], which imposed some restrictions on its use. Extraction of one-dimensional

spectra from two-dimensional echelle frames was executed using a modiﬁed version [28] of the
ECHELLE context from the MIDAS software suite. The removal of traces of cosmic particles
was done by the median averaging of two spectra obtained successively one after another. The
wavelength calibration was carried out using the spectra of the hollow-cathode Th-Ar lamp.
For the subsequent spectrophotometric and positional reduction of one-dimensional spectra we
used a modiﬁed version of the DECH20t code [29]. The control of instrumental matching of the
spectra of the star and the hollow-cathode lamp is made from the telluric lines [O I], O2 and
H2O.

In more detail, the procedure for measuring the radial velocity Vr based on the spectra
obtained with the NES spectrograph, and sources of error are described in [30]. The mean
square Vr measurement error for stars with narrow absorptions in the spectrum does not ex-
ceed 1.0 km s−1 (one-line accuracy [30]). The initial data concerning the obtained spectra are
presented in the ﬁrst three columns of Table 2.

3. Main results

3.1. Peculiarities of the V534 Lyr spectrum

A peculiar feature of the optical spectrum of V534 Lyr is a powerful emission of the Hα proﬁle,
which was noted in all the papers dealing with the spectroscopy of this star (see, for example, [19,
24] and references therein). The Hα line, which is present in seven of eight our spectra, is the
most intense. The variations of its proﬁle with a two-peak emission are signiﬁcant. In the earliest

6

Klochkova et al: On the evolutionary status of high-latitude variable V534 Lyr

spectrum (July 8, 2000) the entire emission proﬁle is located above the continuum. However,
in the subsequent spectra the core of the absorption component which is formed in the surface
layers of the atmosphere falls below the level of the continuum. The position of the absorption
component, as well as the intensities and positions of the emission components vary, but the
intensity of the long-wave peak is always higher than that of the short-wave peak (Fig. 1).
The shift of the blue border of the absorption component relative to the vertical dashed line,
corresponding to Vsys increases in the spectrum of September 24, 2010: Vr − Vsys ≈ −50 km s−1.
A drastic proﬁle variation is observed in the 2017 spectrum. Instead of the two-peak proﬁle
we observe a P Cyg-type proﬁle, the absorption component of which is shifted by Vr − Vsys ≈
−70 km s−1. The Hβ proﬁle is registered in a smaller number of dates, but this is enough to
notice how the stronger of the emission components passes from the red wing to the blue wing
(Fig. 2). Similar variations of Hα and Hβ proﬁles in the spectrum of V534 Lyr were found in
the paper [24]. As it can be seen in Fig. 2, in the spectrum obtained on June 8, 2017, there was
a change in the Hβ proﬁle type to the P Cyg-type with the maximum shift of the absorption
component. A few days later, on June 13, 2017, we can see the splitting of the Hβ absorption
component in the absence of Hα proﬁle variation.

namely A2 Ia, is close to V534 Lyr, but the intensities of the He I 4026 ˚A line are markedly
diﬀerent.

3.2. Radial velocity pattern

Generalized results of radial velocity measurements for each time of observations are presented
in Table 2. Columns (5)–(8) contain the values obtained by averaging the velocities for: the
Fe II 6318, 6384 and 6385 ˚A emission, in the 2017 spectra the Fe II 6493, 7496, 7513 ˚A, emis-
sions, the He I, S II absorption cores, and the doublet Si II (2) absorption core, the cores of the
components of Fe II absorptions, respectively. The last column lists velocity from the Fe II lines
with a low lower-level excitation potential. In the spectra for four dates, these lines are split into
two components, hence two mean velocity values are given: based on the long-wave components,
and below these values the mean velocity for the short-wave components is indicated. Let us
stress that for all the times when it is present in the spectrum the splitting reaches large values:
∆Vr = 20–50 km s−1. In the 2000 spectrum, due to its reduced spectral resolution the absorp-
tion component measurements are unreliable. For this reason, the data for this spectrum are
not given in Fig. 4, which presents the dependences of radial velocity from the central residual
intensity of the corresponding line, Vr (r). One or two signs (in cases of the split absorptions)

the low-excitation Fe II absorptions, the rings – He I, S II, the horizontal lines – mainly the
Fe II 6318, 6384, 6385 ˚A, emissions, and in the spectra of 2017 – the Fe II 6493, 7496, 7513 ˚A
emissions as well. These Fe II emissions are formed in extended envelopes and, being station-
ary for some super- and hypergigants, are used to estimate their systemic velocities Vsys [31].
According to our data, in the investigated star V534 Lyr the velocities determined based on
the emissions at diﬀerent dates of 2010 diﬀer by approximately 5 km s−1, and diﬀerent lines
are shifted by various values, though all in one direction. In the 2013 spectrum, the position of
these emissions is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the previous ones. At the same time, in each of
the dates, the position of the emissions is close to those for the unsplit absorptions, and hence
the velocities in column (5) are close to the velocities in column (6), measured from the upper
parts of absorptions.

The half-width of the Mg II 4481 ˚A line in the V534 Lyr spectrum is δλ = 0.5 ˚A. Using the
dependences of the half-widths of this line on the rotation velocity of the star from [32], we get
a low rotation velocity v sin i = 5–6 km s−1.

Table 2 and Fig. 4 show temporal variations of the positions of all lines and proﬁle shapes of
some of them. The latter phenomenon is mainly associated with the upper layers of the atmo-
sphere. This can be seen, for example, from the fact that the low-excitation Fe II absorptions
in the spectra obtained on 6 April, 2010, June 1, 2010 and October 12, 2013 are split, and the
high-excitation absorptions formed deeper remain single in these dates. Figure 5 demonstrates
this for the Fe II 5363 and 5506 ˚A lines (the low-level excitation potentials 3.2 eV and 10.2 eV
respectively), while Fig. 6 – for the Fe II 5169 ˚A line, the strongest of the of the low-excitation
absorptions in the visible part of the spectrum (its low-level excitation potential is 2.9 eV),
and Si II 6371 ˚A (the lower-level potential is 8.1 eV). In the bottom plot of Fig. 5 (July 30,
2010 and September 24, 2010) the proﬁle of Fe II 5363 ˚A is only slightly asymmetric, and in
the top plot (April 6, 2010) it is split into two components, close in depth and spaced from
each other by 48 km s−1. The proﬁle of Fe II 5169 ˚A (Fig. 6) from April 6, 2010 also consists of
two components, though possessing diﬀerent depths, separated by 56 km s−1. Figure 6 shows
an intermediate case of proﬁle transformation. The absorption of Si II 6371 ˚A (the lower-level
excitation potential of 8.1 eV) in the results of April 6, 2010 observations is clearly not split,
but it is noticeably broadened as compared with the data obtained on September 24, 2010 (in
the spectrum of July 30, 2010 it is absent).

6, 2010 the absorptions are shallower and wider in the wings than in the data from July 30,
2010 and September 24, 2010, while these diﬀerences are relatively small in the high-excitation
Fe II lines, as well as in the He I and S II lines, and are noticeably larger in the low-excitation
Fe II lines. The depths of Fe II 5506 ˚A, determined from the spectra on the dates indicated are
practically identical, while for Fe II 5363 ˚A and Fe II 5169 ˚A they diﬀer by 2.5 and 2.6 times,
respectively. The absorption growth of the Fe II 5363 ˚A line in the observations of April 6,
2010 was by September 24, 2010 compensated by the narrowing the way that its equivalent
width has returned to the previous value. We believe that the broadening and splitting of the
low-excitation Fe II lines are related to the features of the velocity ﬁeld in the upper layers of

the atmosphere, rather than to the appearance of the emission components in them. In the
region of the V534 Lyr spectrum available to us, the latter is conﬁdently observed only in the
hydrogen lines. At certain moments, as noted above, the spectrum revealed weak Fe II 6318,
6384, 6385 ˚A emissions. In the 2017 spectra, the Fe II emissions in the longer-wavelength region
of 7388, 7496, 7513 ˚A were observed.

The diﬀerence in velocities is small: the Vr variations from date to date are from 11 km s−1
for He I and S II to 24 km s−1 for the high-excitation Fe II absorptions. From the data given in
the tables and ﬁgures with line proﬁles, it can be concluded that the radial velocity gradient
in the atmosphere of V534 Lyr was minimal, and it was the most stable on July 30, 2010,
September 24, 2010 and on June 8, 2017: the diﬀerential shifts of lines on these dates are
close to the measurement errors, the widths and anomalies of their proﬁle shapes are minimal.
Assuming that the average radial velocity on these dates were close to the velocity of the
center of mass of the star, we accept Vsys ≈ −125 km s−1 (Vlsr ≈ −105 km s−1) as the ﬁrst
approximation. This estimate is also close to the average velocity values in columns (5)–(7) of
Table 2. Close values of the means and amplitudes are given in [18] and [24], but one must bear
in mind that in these papers the velocities were obtained by averaging over all the measured
lines, not analyzing their features.

3.3. Luminosity and distance of the star

The ﬁrst estimate of the two-dimensional spectral class of V534 Lyr was made by V. Morgan:
B9 Ib [33]. Bonsack and Greenstein [18] changed its spectral class to A0 Iabe, based on the

fact that the Balmer series in the spectrum extends to H24, and the Hβ and Hγ lines have the
emission components, while the amplitude of radial velocity variation is higher than the typical
for the Ib supergiants. The latter argument reinforces the signiﬁcant and variable diﬀerential
shifts of the lines, in particular, the Balmer progress observed on October 12, 2013 (the growth
of Vr from Hα to Hδ from −157 km s−1 from −133 km s−1), and noted by the authors of [24, 18]
and observed by us variability of intensities and positions of the emission features of the H I line
proﬁles. As can be seen in Fig. 1, in the 2000 and 2010 spectra the Hα emission is two-peak,
and the intensity of the red peak is always above the blue one. However, in June 2017, Hα has a
P Cyg-type proﬁle, which in a couple of months acquires the character of a two-peak emission.
The variability of the Hβ proﬁle is similar: as illustrated in Fig. 2, its emission component
passes from the red wing to the blue one. According to the results of observations from June 8,
2017, the Hβ proﬁle is of a P Cyg-type with a powerful and shifted into the short-wave region
absorption, which gets split in the spectrum obtained a few days later, on June 13, 2017.

The spectral class A0 Iab corresponds to the distance to V534 Lyr of d = 5.7 kpc [18].
The interstellar Na I (1) and Ca II (1) line proﬁles in the stellar spectrum also imply its great
remoteness. The presence in them of the components with Vr = −46 km s−1 (Fig. 7), taking into
account the data of Brand and Blitz [34] points to d > 7 kpc. A great remoteness of the star
could be conﬁrmed by its parallax π = 0.379 mas, measured by the GAIA, however, in the DR1
catalog it is burdened with a large error of ±0.378 mas. A noticeable own motion 3.′′6 ± 0.′′8 in
the 35 catalog at d ≈ 6 kpc corresponds to the velocity 103 km s−1, directed to the plane of
the Galaxy. In combination with Vlsr ≈ −105 km s−1 this yields the spatial velocity of about
140 km s−1.

The presence of interstellar components in the Na I (1) and Ca II (1) lines forced us to under-
take a search for possible DIBs. Luna et al. [36] in their study of interstellar and circumstellar
absorption for the sample of post-AGB stars, found two such features (5780 and 5797 ˚A) in the
spectrum of V534 Lyr. However, their measurements of the DIB positions are widely scattered.
In our spectra, there are no features that could be reliably identiﬁed with the known DIBs.

Figure 7. The stellar (dashed line) and interstellar parts of the Na I D2 and Ca II K line proﬁles
in the spectrum obtained on October 12, 2013. The vertical dotted line is as in Fig.1.

The only feature that can be identiﬁed with the strongest of the known bands, 5780 ˚A is very
weak in the spectrum of V534 Lyr – its depth is only around 0.015.

The obtained distance estimate of d ≈ 6 kpc for the high-latitude star with the apparent
stellar magnitude of V = 8.m58 [21] leads us to the value of its absolute magnitude: MV ≈ −5.m3,
which, according to [37], corresponds to the spectral class of V534 Lyr. Vickers et al. [38], model-
ing the energy distribution in the spectrum stars, obtained the distance of d ≈ 3.19 ± 0.43 kpc.
This reduced distance estimate leads to a decrease in the absolute magnitude, MV ≈ −3.m94,
and worsens the agreement of spectral class and luminosity.

The luminosity of the star can be determined from the equivalent width of the oxygen IR
triplet O I 7773 ˚A in the spectrum of V534 Lyr: Wλ = 1.99 ˚A. Using the calibration from [39, 40],
we get a very high luminosity, MV ≈ −8.m0. However, this estimate is burdened by considerable
errors, since both calibrations were obtained by the authors of [39, 40] for the population I super-
giants. The star we are investigating, V534 Lyr, obviously does not refer to massive supergiants.
In addition, its luminosity estimate is also distorted by the speciﬁc chemical composition of the
atmosphere, primarily, by an anomalous oxygen abundance.

3.4. Determination of model atmosphere parameters and chemical abundances

To determine the main parameters of the model: eﬀective temperature Teﬀ and surface gravity
log g, we used our standard method [41], which was successfully used in the studies of spectra of
various types of stars. The parameters Teﬀ and log g were determined based on the requirement
of the ionization balance, i.e. the equality of iron abundance, calculated from the Fe I and Fe II
lines. Microturbulent velocity ξt was also found using the standard method from the condition
of absence of the dependence of iron abundances log ǫ (Fe I, Fe II), determined from a set of
lines, on their equivalent widths Wλ. To account for possible variations, the parameters Teﬀ and
log g were found for each available time of observations. The obtained individual temperatures
Teﬀ, given in column (4) of the Table 2, diﬀer from each other only slightly. Their diﬀerences are
within the error limits of determining this parameter; therefore, to calculate the abundances of
chemical elements, we used the mean value of Teﬀ = 10 000 K. This estimate agrees with the
previous Teﬀ estimate from [24] perfectly well, which is an additional indication of the constancy
of stellar temperature. Note that earlier in the paper by Arellano Ferro et al. [19] the condition
of solar helium abundance in the atmosphere was accepted for determining the temperature of
V534 Lyr which led to a higher value Teﬀ = 11 500K.

We controlled the identiﬁcation of features in the spectrum of V1 534 Lyr involving the at-
las [42] with high-resolution spectra of A-supergiants. The content of chemical elements in the
atmosphere of the studied star is calculated from the equivalent line widths in the LTE ap-
proximation. The calculation of the model atmosphere, the abundance of chemical elements
and the calculation of synthetic spectra are performed using the WIDTH9 code based on the
Kurucz model grid [43], adapted for the OS Linux environment [44]. The excitation potentials
and oscillator strengths for all the lines, as well as the broadening constants are taken from the
Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD) [45].

Taking into account the above-described peculiarities of the V534 Lyr spectrum, we calcu-
lated its chemical composition from the equivalent widths of the absorptions measured in the
spectrum of June 8, 2017. In the choice of observational material, we were guided by the reg-
istered wavelength range and the absence of absorption splitting in the spectrum (Fig. 4 and
Table 2). To increase the number of lines we partially involved the data on the equivalent widths
of unsplit lines from the 2013 spectrum. The results of the calculation performed with the pa-
rameters Teﬀ = 10 000 K, log g = 2.5, ξt = 4.0 are presented in Table 4, where the number of
lines used and the root-mean-square error of determining the element abundances are indicated.
In the last column of the table the relative values of [X/Fe]⊙ are given, for the calculations of
which we used the information about the element abundances in the photosphere of the Sun
according to Asplund et al. [46].

4. Discussion

The presence of an emission-absorption proﬁle of the Hα line, in which the position of the
emission components and their intensity ratio vary with time is a sign of passage of a shock
wave in the stellar atmosphere. In addition, we see a low-amplitude variability of radial velocity
from the lines with a high excitation potential, which are formed in deep layers of the stellar
atmosphere. Therefore, we have registered the signs of pulsational instability of the star. In
the spectra of V534 Lyr we found a previously unknown feature: splitting of proﬁles of selected
metal absorptions at separate times of observations. This kind of metal line splitting indicates

the pulsations of W Vir-type stars. A good example is the velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere of
W Vir itself [47]. An additional argument conﬁrming the presence of pulsations is given to us
by the analysis of individual velocities based on the split lines in the spectrum of June 13, 2017,
where the degree of splitting of the low-excitation absorptions varies depending on the depth
of absorptions. This diﬀerence is illustrated by the data in the last line of Table 2 and the panel
of Vr (r) dependences in Fig. 4, obtained on June 13, 2017.

The parameters of the model atmosphere and the chemical element abundances in the at-
mosphere of V534 Lyr we have determined diﬀer little from the previously published [24]. Here
we will consider the features of the chemical composition only brieﬂy. A detailed analysis of
the chemical composition of this star is diﬃcult for a number of reasons: a very limited set
of obtained abundances of chemical elements; application of the standard model atmosphere
in the case of a star whose atmosphere is unstable and probably subject to the inﬂuence of
shock waves. A contribution of error due to the neglect of the eﬀect of deviation from the local
thermodynamic equilibrium is also possible. However, their impact on the metallicity estimate
for a hot star is small [48].

The main groups of elements whose relative abundances allow us to judge on the stage of
evolution of the star and its belonging to this or that population of the Galaxy are as follows:

16

Klochkova et al: On the evolutionary status of high-latitude variable V534 Lyr

the CNO-triad, the iron group (Cr, V, Fe, Ni), the α-process light metals (Mg, Al, Si, P, S) and
the s-process heavy metals. The abundance of iron in the atmosphere of V534 Lyr is slightly
lowered: [Fe/H]⊙ = −0.28, which, in combination with a high radial velocity Vr ≈ −125 km s−1
points to the fact that the star belongs to the thick disk of the Galaxy. The abundance of metals
of the iron group (Cr, V, Mn, Ni) is slightly diﬀerent of the iron abundance: [Met/Fe]⊙ = +0.06.
To determine the status of a far-evolved star, the principal in the element prevalence is
the abundance of elements of the CNO group. We have reliably determined a high nitrogen
abundance [N/Fe]⊙ = +1.10 from two N I lines of low intensity. The nitrogen excess in the
atmosphere of the supergiant can be the result of the ﬁrst mixing, at which the removal of
products of the CN-cycle during the burning of hydrogen in the core is in force. A large helium
excess, [He/Fe]⊙ = +1.27 is a result of a sequence of nuclear reactions in the stellar core and
their subsequent mixing. The excess of oxygen in V534 Lyr is illustrated in the bottom panel of
Fig. 3, where the fragments of the spectra of V534 Lyr and α Cyg containing the O I 6155–6157 ˚A
oxygen lines are mapped. We can also clearly see here a weakening of the Fe II ion lines in the
spectrum of V534 Lyr in comparison with the spectrum of α Cyg. The abundances of light metals
(Mg, Al, Si, P, S), synthesized owing to the α-process are strengthened in the atmosphere of
V534 Lyr on the average by [α/Fe] = +0.4. The strengthening of light metals is consistent with
the fact that the star pertains to the thick disk of the Galaxy, as evidenced by the results of
the extensive sample of thick-disk stars with a close metallicity [49].

With respect to the observed set of properties, a hot star HD 105262, which is located in the
Galaxy at a high latitude of b = 72.◦47 and has the B9–A0 spectral class can be regarded as an
analog of V534 Lyr. In the SIMBAD database this star is cataloged as a post-AGB supergiant.
Earlier this star, having no IR excess, was considered as a representative of an earlier stage
of evolution, namely, of the horizontal branch (hereafter – HB). Klochkova and Panchuk [50],
using the photographic spectra determined the parameters of Teﬀ = 8500 K, the surface gravity
log g = 1.5, reduced metallicity [Fe/H]⊙ = −1.2 and a detailed chemical composition of the
atmosphere. In their recent work, Giridhar et al. [51] obtained the same parameters of the
model, though the metallicity is much lower: [Fe/H]⊙ ≈ −1.9. This diﬀerence can be explained
by a higher spectral resolution of the spectra in [51]. For the comparison we make between
V534 Lyr and HD 105262, a large excess of nitrogen, found in the atmosphere of HD 105262 [51]
is important. Both stars have a low rotation velocity, v sin i = 6 km s−1. For HD 105262, rotation
velocity is measured from the high-resolution spectra in [52]. Belonging to the HB stage can
explain the absence in V534 Lyr and HD 105262 of the circumstellar dust and infrared excess
caused by it.

The spectral features, similar to the peculiarities of the spectrum V534 Lyr are observed
in the A-supergiant BD+48◦1220. The optical high-resolution spectra based on which a
signiﬁcant variability of the H I and metal line proﬁles were obtained over several obser-
vational seasons at the 6-m BTA telescope combined with an echelle spectrograph [53].
The analysis of this spectral material by the atmospheric model method with the param-
eters Teﬀ = 7900 K, log g = 0.0, ξt = 6.0 has shown that the metallicity BD+48◦1220 is
close to solar: [Fe/H]⊙ = −0.10 [54], and the chemical composition of its atmosphere dif-
fers little from that of V534 Lyr. As in the case of V534 Lyr, a large helium excess was
detected, [He/H] = +1.04 and an equally signiﬁcant excess of oxygen [O/Fe]⊙ = +0.72 dex.
At that, the carbon excess is small, [C/Fe]⊙ = +0.09, and the ratio [C/O] < 1. The abun-
dances of light metals are changed: [Na/Fe]⊙ = +0.87 at [Mg/Fe]⊙ = −0.31. But the most

Klochkova et al: On the evolutionary status of high-latitude variable V534 Lyr

important – in the atmosphere of BD+48◦1220 a large excess of
lithium is detected
[Li/Fe]⊙ = +0.62, what indicates the transfer of this element, synthesized at the AGB stage,
into the atmosphere. In addition, it was concluded on the probable eﬃciency of the mechanism
of selective separation of chemical elements onto the dust particles of the envelope. A full set
of the available data (luminosity Mv ≈ −5m, velocity Vlsr ≈ −20 km s−1, reduced metallicity
and the features of the optical spectrum and chemical composition) conﬁrms the status of the
O-rich post-AGB star with the initial mass of 4 ÷ 9M⊙. Thus, the star BD+48◦1220, having a
number of properties close to V534 Lyr is a supergiant at a more advanced stage, after AGB.
We therefore see that the observed properties of V534 Lyr, with the exception of its high
luminosity and location outside the plane of the Galaxy do not give any grounds for classifying
it as a post-AGB star. The main fact is that V534 Lyr does not have an IR excess or chemical
composition anomalies expected for the post-AGB supergiant. Let us consider other possible
variants of its status. The lack of a dust envelope at a suﬃciently high luminosity allows to
consider it as an object at the stage after the red giant branch, located at an evolutionary stage
above the HB. The source of energy release in the stars at this stage, past the helium ﬂash in
the core is the burning of helium in the core and hydrogen in the layer. A large mass loss is not
expected in these supergiants. To conﬁrm this status of the star one can rely on a convenient
diagram log g–Teﬀ (Fig. 1 in [52]). The set of fundamental parameters of V534 Lyr corresponds
to the HB stars in the diagram. A low rotation velocity v sin i = 5–6 km s−1 is also consistent
with the supposed status near the BHB: it is known that HB stars rotate slowly [55, 48]. The
results we obtained here for V534 Lyr make up another conﬁrmation of the conclusion [2, 56]
on the heterogeneity of the sample of PPN candidates.

A combination of the observed features of V534 Lyr: the presence of pulsations in deep layers
of the atmosphere, reduced metallicity, the type and variability of the emission-absorption Hα
proﬁle allows us to assume that the star belongs to pulsating population II stars that are located
in the instability band above the HB and evolve to the AGB. Depending on the mass and hence
on the period of pulsations, it can be a BL Her or W Vir-type star. A direct indication of the
status of the pulsating star is provided by the optical spectrum features: two-peak emissions and
time-variable Hα and Hβ line proﬁles (Figs. 1 and 2), the presence at some times of observations
of the absorption splitting (Fig. 5) and the presence of a velocity gradient in the atmosphere,
registered on June 13, 2017, which is clearly visible in Fig. 4.

It is useful to pay attention here to the study of the chemical composition of a sample of 19
variable population II stars [57], based on the high-resolution spectroscopy. To calculate the
abundances of chemical elements, the authors used only the spectra in which there were no
signs of splitting (or asymmetry) of absorptions or emissions in the Balmer line series. Maas
et al. [57] made a conclusion about the fundamental diﬀerence of the chemical composition in
BL Her or W Vir-type stars: in the atmospheres of the BL Her-type stars, the Na abundance
is higher than that in the W Vir-type stars. This conclusion gives us grounds to more likely
classify the investigated star V534 Lyr to the Virginids: we failed to ﬁnd any of the Na I lines
in the spectra of V534 Lyr, expected in the case of an excess of this element in the atmosphere.
Typical representatives of the W Vir-type stars are the globular cluster members. An example
is the Virginid V1 (K 307), a member of the globular cluster M 12. The authors of [58] deter-
mined its main parameters (Teﬀ = 5600 K, log g = 1.3) and metallicity [Fe/H] = −1.27, which
agrees with the metallicity of other members of M 12. The atmosphere of this Virginid revealed
altered abundances of CNO-elements, while nitrogen is in excess: [N/Fe] = +1.15 dex. Relative

18

Klochkova et al: On the evolutionary status of high-latitude variable V534 Lyr

abundances of Na and the α-process elements: Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Ti are also strengthened
in a various degree. The main feature of the spectrum of K 307 is the presence of complex
absorption-emission proﬁles of the Hβ and Hα lines (see Fig. 2 in [58]), similar to the proﬁles
in the spectrum of V534 Lyr.

The basic kinematic and chemical parameters for an extensive sample of HB stars in the
thick disk are considered by Kinman et al. [59]. Our assumption that V534 Lyr can be a thick
disk star in the stage above HB (post-HB) is conﬁrmed by a large spatial velocity of the studied
star, the absence of a dusty circumstellar envelope, and a speciﬁc chemical composition of the
atmosphere. A factor complicating the ﬁxation of the stellar status is that stars of several
evolutionary stages can be located above the HB: it can be young enough stars, evolving to
RGB, as well as the stars more advanced in the stellar evolution after or yet before the AGB.
The answer to the question critical for more speciﬁc conclusions is on the possible binarity of
V534 Lyr. The Vr variations with time are probably caused by pulsations, however, a spectral
SB 1-type binarity is not yet excluded. The found velocity variability based on the Fe II emission
(2) can be considered an indication on the possible binarity of the star. Note here the results of
S¸ahin and Jeﬀery [60], who, having analyzed the variability of photometric data for V534 Lyr
did not ﬁnd an explicit period and assumed that the variations can be short-period. There are
currently no reliable photometric and spectral data required for the study and determination
of the variability parameters of brightness and spectrum. Therefore, it is extremely necessary
to conduct a long-term and detailed monitoring of V534 Lyr for the ﬁnal conclusions about the
nature of its variability.

5. Conclusions

Based on the observations at the 6-m telescope with the NES echelle spectrograph (R = 60 000)
we investigated the features of the optical spectrum of V534 Lyr, a high-latitude star with an
uncertain status. For all the observation dates, heliocentric radial velocities Vr correspond to
the positions of all the components of metal absorption, as well as the Na I D and Hα lines
were measured. The analysis of the velocity ﬁeld from the lines of diﬀerent nature revealed
a small-amplitude Vr variability from the lines with a high excitation potential, which are
formed in deep layers of stellar atmosphere, and allowed us to estimate the systemic velocity
Vsys ≈ −125 km s−1 (Vlsr ≈ −105 km s−1). The estimated distance d ≈ 6 kpc for a high-latitude
star leads to the absolute magnitude estimate of MV ≈ −5.3m, which agrees with the spectral
classiﬁcation of V534 Lyr.

We discovered an as yet unknown for this star spectral phenomenon: splitting of proﬁles
of the selected metal absorptions at separate times of observation. For all the moments when
splitting is present in the spectrum, it reaches large values: ∆Vr = 20–50 km s−1.

The spectral class of the star is close to A0 Ib, while its eﬀective temperature is Teﬀ ≈
10 500 K. Metallicity, reliably determined by metal lines of the iron group (Cr, V, Mn, Ni)
slightly diﬀers from the abundance of this element: [Met/Fe] = +0.06. The nitrogen and helium
excess indicates an advanced evolutionary stage of the star. A low iron-group metal abundance
in combination with a high radial velocity indicates that the star belongs to the thick disk of
the Galaxy.

The whole of observed peculiarities of V534 Lyr: the presence of probable pulsations in deep
layers of the atmosphere, splitting of metal absorption proﬁles with the low lower-level excitation

potential registered at separate times of observations, reduced metallicity, type and variability
of the emission-absorption Hα and Hβ proﬁle allows us to place the star amid the pulsating
population II stars, which are located in the instability band near the HB. In general, we can
conclude that there is a complete discrepancy between the properties of V534 Lyr we have
registered and the post-AGB stage, where the star was referred to in the previously published
papers.
