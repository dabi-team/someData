ABSTRACT
We present Keck II/DEIMOS spectroscopy of the three distant dwarf galaxies of M31 Lacerta I,
Cassiopeia III, and Perseus I, recently discovered within the Pan-STARRS1 3π imaging survey. The

Cassiopeia III, the high quality of the data obtained for 126 and 212 member stars, respectively, yields

reliable constraints on their global velocity dispersions (σvr = 10.3 ± 0.9 km s−

within their half-light
radius. These translate to V -band mass-to-light ratios of 15+12
5 in solar units. We also use our
spectroscopic data to determine the average metallicity of the 3 dwarf galaxies ([Fe/H] = −2.0 ± 0.1,
−1.7 ± 0.1, and −2.0 ± 0.2, respectively). All these properties are typical of dwarf galaxy satellites of
Andromeda with their luminosity and size.

Lac I, Per I — galaxies: kinematics and dynamics

1. INTRODUCTION
The systematic coverage of the northern sky yielded by
the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3π survey provides a spatially
complete mapping of the regions around Andromeda
(M31), irrespective of the close proximity of the Galactic
plane. This has led to the discovery of three dwarf galax-
ies: Cassiopeia III (Cas III or Andromeda XXXII), Lac-
erta I (Lac I or Andromeda XXXI; Martin et al. 2013b),
and Perseus I (Per I or Andromeda XXXIII; Martin et al.
<
2013a), all reasonably bright (−12 <
∼ − 10) and
within 30◦ of M31. As they all three have M31-centric
distances between 145 and 375 kpc, they are thought to
be distant satellites of M31. Such distant dwarf galaxies
would have a signiﬁcant weight in constraining the mass
of their host (e.g. Watkins et al. 2010) or even its proper
motion (van der Marel & Guhathakurta 2008). How-
ever, their usefulness in this endeavor depends on the
conﬁrmation that these three systems are indeed satel-
lites of M31.

∼ MV

We have consequently embarked in a spectroscopic pro-
gram to gather spectra of numerous stars in these sys-
tems with the DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck II. Our
goal is not only to determine the systemic velocity of the
three dwarf galaxies to conﬁrm that they are bound to

M31, but also to infer their internal dynamics, masses,
and metallicities, and how these compare to the proper-
ties of other (mainly closer) M31 dwarf galaxies.

In this Letter, we present the ﬁrst results of our cam-
paign and constrain the systemic velocities, velocity dis-
persions, and metallicities of the three dwarf galaxies.
This work is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the
observations and data reduction, Section 3 describes our
analysis and results, and we discuss their implications in
Section 4.

2. OBSERVATIONS
The selection of targets for the DEIMOS observations
is based on the PS1 photometry for Lac I and Cas III
(Martin et al. 2013b) and a rederivation of the photome-
try from the PS1 images in the case of Per I (Martin et al.
2013a). Sources were selected to be compatible with red
giant branch (RGB) stars from the three dwarf galaxies
<
∼ 1.1) and priorities were
(iP1,0
set to favor stars closer to the tip of the RGB for which
the photometric uncertainties are smaller. We created 2
masks for Lac I, 4 for Cas III, and 1 for Per I. The result-
ing targets for which we acquired good quality spectra
are highlighted in the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)
and spatial distributions of Figure 1, color-coded by the
dwarf-galaxy-membership probability we calculate in the
next Section.

The Lac I and Cas III observations were conducted
during the nights of August 28–29, 2013, under good to
exquisite conditions (clear sky, seeing in the range 0.4–
0.9′′). Each mask was observed for a total of 7200 s, split
into six 1200 s subexposures. A realignment of the masks
was performed after every subexposure to ensure that
we could track the stability of a star’s location inside
its slit. Moreover, once on target, we observed NeAr-
KrXe arc lamps before and after the acquisition of a

mask to facilitate the wavelength calibration. The sin-
gle Per I mask was acquired on the night of October 3,
2013 since this galaxy was not yet discovered at the time
of the other observations. This mask was observed for
3 × 1200 s under reasonable seeing conditions (∼ 1′′), but
with ﬂeeting clouds. In addition, one of the two Lac I
masks was also reobserved during this night to check the
stability of the setup and data reduction over time. For
all the observations, the instrumental set up covers the
5600–9800 ◦A wavelength range with the 1200 line/mm−
1
grating at a spectral resolution of ∼ 0.33 ◦A/pixel. The
Lac I and Cas III spectra have typical signal-to-noise
per pixel S/N > 10 at iP1 = 21.0 and S/N > 4 at
iP1 = 22.0. For the Per I mask with a shorter integra-
tion time, 3 < S/N < 6.

The spectra are extracted and reduced through a
custom-built pipeline that follows the procedure de-
scribed in Ibata et al. (2011) and Collins et al. (2013).
In addition, the quality of our spectra is good enough
that we can use the Fraunhofer A band line in the range
7595–7630 ◦A to calculate small telluric corrections that
stem from minute misalignments of the stars in the slits
(e.g. Sohn et al. 2007). Heliocentric radial velocities, vr,

are measured from the three strong lines of the Calcium
triplet at 8498, 8542, and 8662 ◦A. We only keep in our
sample stars for which S/N > 2 per pixel, the uncer-
1, and
tainty on the velocity, δvr, is smaller than 10 km s−
1.
−600 < vr < 200 km s−

Our observations include a sizable sample of 82 good-
quality repeat measurements, which allows for a reli-
able determination of the uncertainty ﬂoor of our ob-
1, as deﬁned in equation
servations, ǫ = 3.4 ± 0.5 km s−
(1) of Simon & Geha (2007). This uncertainty ﬂoor is
added in quadrature to the measured velocity uncertain-
ties, which also include the uncertainty from the telluric
correction. Multiple observations of the same star are
combined through the uncertainty-weighted average of
their velocities before adding the uncertainty ﬂoor.

A visual inspection of the spectra betrays the presence
of a handful of carbon stars in both Lac I and Cas III,
identiﬁed from the characteristic “serrated” shape of
their spectra. Although the detailed study of these stars
is beyond the scope of this Laper, their presence could
indicate that Lac I and Cas III host intermediate age
populations. These carbon stars were removed from the
data sets studied in this Letter.

ties at the large M31-distances of the three dwarf galax-
ies include part of the systemic proper motion of M31,
they are still mainly dominated by the M31 systemic ra-
dial velocity. The diﬀerence, vr,M31, between hvr,gsri and
1 therefore informs us as to whether
hvM31
the dwarf galaxies are likely to be bound to M31. As can
be seen in Figure 3, all dwarf galaxies are likely bound
to M31 despite their large M31-centric distances, under
the assumption that they have reasonable proper mo-
tions. Lac I and Per I could potentially be beyond the
escape velocity of M31 if we are to assume that our cos-
mic neighbor has a low mass (< 1.5 × 1012 M
), but
this appears unrealistic given its large number of satel-
lite dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and stellar streams
(e.g. Martin et al. 2013a; Diaz et al. 2014).

The high quality of the Lac I and Cas III samples, with
126 and 212 member stars, respectively, also yields good
constraints on their velocity dispersions, which we infer
1. In the
to be σvr = 10.3 ± 0.9 km s−
case of Per I, the constraints on the velocity dispersion
is much weaker since they rely on only 12 stars. The
1, but only models with
favored value is σvr = 4.2 km s−
1 can reasonably be rejected (at the 90-
σvr > 10 km s−
percent conﬁdence level). All the properties of the dwarf
galaxies are summarized in Table 1.

Marginalizing over all models for a given dwarf galaxy,
we also calculate the membership probability of every
star in the sample for this dwarf galaxy. In all three cases,
there is a clear separation between the contamination
and the likely member stars, which all have very high
membership probabilities.

We use equation (11) of Walker et al. (2009) to infer
an estimate of the dynamical masses of Lac I and Cas III,
folding in the uncertainties on the structural parameters
(sampling from the MCMC chain of Martin et al. 2013b),
those on the distance modulus (Martin et al. 2013b), and
those on the velocity dispersion by sampling the MCMC
chain calculated above. This yields Mhalf = 4.2+0.8

length region surrounding the triplet (8400–8700 ◦A). We
then divide the spectrum by the continuum ﬁt, resulting
in a normalised spectrum from which we can measure the
equivalent widths of the Ca triplet by simultaneously ﬁt-
ting the continuum level using a polynomial and the 3
Ca lines using 3 Gaussian proﬁles. Each line ﬁt is then
checked for contamination from nearby sky lines by com-
paring the ratios of their equivalent widths with the ex-
pectation from higher resolution studies of the Ca triplet
in RGB stars (e.g. Battaglia et al. 2008). Contaminated
lines are excluded from the determination of the ﬁnal
equivalent width for the triplet (see Collins et al. 2013
for more details). Finally, we use the Starkenburg et al.
(2010) relation to determine the value of [Fe/H] for each
star from this equivalent width measurement10 and its I-
band absolute magnitude, converted from the PS1 pho-
tometry (Tonry et al. 2012).

A comparison of the metallicity yielded by stars ob-
served on multiple masks implies that the uncertainties
on these individual [Fe/H] measurements are sizeable
(∼ 0.4 dex), preventing a measure of the metallicity
spread. We can nevertheless use the large size of the
samples to derive a precise median metallicity. These
are derived from a Monte Carlo sampling of the individ-
ual metallicity values and their associated uncertainties,
yielding [Fe/H] = −2.0 ± 0.1 and −1.7 ± 0.1 for Lac I and
Cas III, respectively.

In the case of the lower quality Per I data, we are
limited to generating a single stacked spectrum of the 12
stars with a high membership probability. This spectrum
yields the average metallicity [Fe/H] = −2.0±0.2 for this

the recalibration of this relation to use either 2 or 3 clean Calcium
triplet lines.

3.2. Metallicities
In the case of Lac I and Cas III, we measure the metal-
licity, [Fe/H], of each member star using the equivalent
widths of the Ca triplet lines. First, we determine the
continuum for each star by ﬁtting a B-spline to the wave-

of MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies and Local Group dwarf
irregular galaxies (equation (3) of Kirby et al. 2013) and
may not faithfully represent M31 satellites.
It should
also be noted that the metallicity of many of the M31
satellites are rather uncertain as they are usually mea-
sured from only a handful of stars. Overall, these do
not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from our [Fe/H] measurements for
Cas III and Per I. Lac I appears more metal-poor than
expected, but this could also be due to an overestimation
of its (uncertain) luminosity. Conﬁrmation of its depar-
ture from the luminosity-metallicity relation will have to
be conﬁrmed with deeper photometry than accessible by
the PS1 survey.

While the left panel of Figure 4 focusses on the com-
parison of the size and mass of the dwarf galaxies with
dark-matter dominated models, it is interesting to note
that the velocity dispersion values we measure are in
agreement with the MOND-ian predictions calculated by
McGaugh & Milgrom (2013). The favored low velocity
dispersion we infer for Per I, albeit with large uncer-
tainties, is also in agreement with similar predictions by
Pawlowski & McGaugh (2014).

Finally, it should be mentioned that, although Cas III
overlaps with the thin rotating disk of Andromeda dwarf
galaxies (Ibata et al. 2013), its velocity indicates that it
is moving counter to the global motion of that structure.
A detailed study of the dynamics of Lac I and Cas III,
based on their large velocity samples, will be the topic of
a future contribution.

locities (Figure 3).
In the case of Lac I and Cas III,
we obtain good constraints on their velocity disper-

All the properties we derive for the three dwarf galax-
ies are typical of other M31 (or Local Group) satellite
galaxies, as we exemplify in Figure 4 in which we com-
pare the dwarf galaxies with the other Andromeda dwarf
galaxies in the context of the Collins et al. (2014, left
panel) size-mass relation, and the luminosity-metallicity
relation of Kirby et al. (2013, right panel). The only
point of mild tension comes from the metallicity of the
dwarf galaxies; these are on the low side of expectations.
