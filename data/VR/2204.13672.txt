ABSTRACT
We map the 3D kinematics of the Galactic disc out to 3.5 kpc from the Sun, and within 0.75
kpc from the midplane of the Milky Way. To this end, we combine high quality astrometry
from Gaia EDR3, with the radial velocities from Gaia DR2, and from major spectroscopic
surveys including APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST. We construct an axisymmetric model
for the mean velocity ﬁeld, and then subtract this on a star-by-star basis to obtain the peculiar
velocity ﬁeld in the Galactocentric components, 𝑉𝜙, 𝑉𝑅, 𝑉𝑧, as well as the heliocentric line-
of-sight, 𝑉los. The velocity residuals are quantiﬁed using the power spectrum, and we ﬁnd that
the peak power (𝐴) in the midplane (|𝑧| < 0.25 kpc) is (𝐴𝜙, 𝐴R, 𝐴Z, 𝐴los)=(4.2, 8.5, 2.6, 4.6),
at 0.25 < |𝑧|/[kpc] < 0.5, is (𝐴𝜙, 𝐴R, 𝐴Z, 𝐴los)=(4.0, 7.9, 3.6, 5.3), and at 0.5 < |𝑧|/[kpc] <
0.75, is (𝐴𝜙, 𝐴R, 𝐴Z, 𝐴los)=(1.9, 6.9, 5.2, 6.4). Our results provide for the ﬁrst time, a measure
of the streaming motion in the disc in the individual components. We ﬁnd that streaming is
most signiﬁcant in the Galactocentric radial component, and at all heights (|𝑍 |) probed, but
is also not negligible in the other components. Additionally, we ﬁnd that the patterns in the
velocity ﬁeld overlap spatially with models for the Spiral arms in the Milky Way. Finally, we
demonstrate using a simulation that phase mixing of disrupting spiral arms can generate such
residuals in the velocity ﬁeld, where the radial component is dominant, just as in the real data.
The simulation also suggests that with evolution of time both the amplitude and the physical
scale of the peculiar motion decreases.

INTRODUCTION

Mapping the spatial and kinematic properties of the Milky Way disc
has been an ongoing endeavour for several decades. These eﬀorts,
spread across wavelength, and sky coverage, have shown us that
the Galactic disc is a complex structure. Non-axisymmetric features
of varying scalelengths and scaleheights, such as the Galactic bar
(Babusiaux & Gilmore 2005; Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2008; Wegg
et al. 2015), and Spiral arms (Reid & Brunthaler 2004; Reid et al.
2019; Poggio et al. 2021), pervade the stellar disc. Additionally,
observations have shown that the disc is roughly ﬂat out to the
Solar radius, and then bends away from the plane, to give a warped
appearance (Drimmel & Spergel 2001; Yusifov 2004; Chen et al.
2019). In recent years, the kinematic signatures of this stellar warp

in vertical velocities, have also been mapped (Poggio et al. 2017;
Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018b; Poggio et al. 2018).

Much of the mapping of the disc has relied on large photo-
metric and spectroscopic surveys, such as SDSS (Jurić et al. 2008;
York et al. 2000), RAVE (Steinmetz et al. 2020), APOGEE (Majew-
ski et al. 2017; Jönsson et al. 2020) , LAMOST (Cui et al. 2012;
Zhao et al. 2012), and GALAH (De Silva et al. 2015). Such magni-
tude limited surveys have provided large statistical samples of stars
with line-of-sight velocity (𝑉los), and chemical abundances. Using
standard-candle like tracers (ex: red clump giants, RC hereafter),
to estimate distances, the kinematics could then be mapped out to
several kpc from the Sun. Using Red Clump stars from the RAVE
survey, Williams et al. (2013) showed that stars in the disc are par-
ticipating in bulk motion, and that there are diﬀerences in the bulk
motion (or streaming) North and South of the Galactic plane. In
particular, for the Galactocentric radial velocity (𝑉𝑅), they found

evidence of a large outward ﬂow above the plane, and inward ﬂow
below the plane. For the Galactocentric vertical velocity (𝑉𝑧), they
ﬁnd a wave-like pattern, where, stars interior to the Solar circle
and above the plane are moving upwards, while those below, down-
wards. Similar wave-like compression/rarefaction was also seen in
both number density and bulk velocity in the SDSS data by Widrow
et al. (2012), and also towards the Galactic anti-center with LAM-
OST data (Carlin et al. 2013).

The results from these studies have hinted at large scale ve-
locity ﬂows and ﬂuctuations in the Galactic disc. If the Galaxy is
axisymmetric, and in dynamical equilibrium, we expect negligible
ﬂuctuations in the residual velocity ﬁeld. Bovy (2015, B15 here-
after) studied the deviations from an axisymmetric model for the
line-of-sight velocity ﬁeld, for a sample of red clump giants from
the APOGEE survey (Bovy et al. 2014). They found that the power
spectrum of the velocity residuals had a peak of about 11 km s−1,
and the corresponding physical scale was about 2.5 kpc. Their re-
sult suggested the presence of streaming motion on scales an order
of magnitude larger than the Solar neighbourhood. Furthermore,
B15 found that the peak power in the velocity residuals, could be
minimised if the azimuthal component of the Solar peculiar veloc-
ity was 𝑉(cid:12) = 22.5 km s−1, i.e., about 10 km s−1 higher than the
widely used 𝑉(cid:12) = 12.24 km s−1 (Local Standard of Rest, Schönrich
et al. 2010). Thus, such large-scale streaming motion has important
implications for the local standard of rest.

However, while the RC is a very useful distance tracer, in-
trinsic population variance (Girardi 2016; Nataf et al. 2016) can
introduce systematic errors in the distance estimates. In particular,
in Khanna et al. (019a, K18 hereafter), we showed that standard
spectro-photometric schemes for selecting RC stars, contaminate
the samples with a high mass tail of core Helium burning stars, that
are not standard-candles. The distance estimates for these high mass
(brighter) contaminants are under-estimated. In K18, we expanded
on the work by B15, and showed that some of the high velocity
residuals in the red clump 𝑉los maps, could be due to incorrect
distance estimates for the high mass tail stars. Using a RC sample
by combining the GALAH and APOGEE surveys, we probed the
non-axisymmetric motion in the midplane of the Galactic disc, as
well as out to 1 kpc away from the plane. As in B15, we subtracted
an axisymmetric model for the 𝑉los, but allowing for ﬂexibility in
the circular velocity proﬁle (radial and vertical), as well as on the
dispersion scale length. We showed that, after taking into account,
various systematics, the peak power in the velocity residuals was
no more than about 6 km s−1 in the midplane, and consistent with
Poisson noise away from the plane.

With the advent of the Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016)
astrometric datasets, we now have at our disposal proper motion
measurements for over a billion stars in the Galaxy. The second
data release (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018a, Gaia DR2) also pro-
vided line-of-sight velocities for about 7 million stars mostly with
magnitude 𝐺 < 13 (Soubiran et al. 2018, RVS henceforth). In De-
cember 2020, the astrometry and photometry were updated as part
of The Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021a,
Gaia EDR3). The release is based on 33 months of observations
and marks a signiﬁcant improvement over the previous Gaia DR2,
bettering precision in proper motion by nearly a factor of two, and in
parallax by 30%. Combined with radial velocities from the RVS set,
this forms a very powerful dataset to probe the disc kinematics. The
typical precision of proper motion catalogues in the pre-Gaia era,
of the order of 2 mas 𝑦𝑟−1 down to magnitude 15 (Zacharias et al.
2017), has now been improved by nearly two orders of magnitude.
The immense impact of the improved dataset can be seen across sev-

eral works that have, and keep discovering new substructure across
the Galactic disc (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018c; Antoja et al.
2018; Ramos et al. 2018; Fragkoudi et al. 2019; Bland-Hawthorn
et al. 2019; Khanna et al. 2019; Trick et al. 2019; Hunt et al. 2019;
Monari et al. 2019; Trick et al. 2021; Laporte et al. 2020; Eilers
et al. 2020; Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021b).

In this paper, we exploit the high precision astrometry from
Gaia EDR3, and combine it with radial velocities from Gaia DR2,
and the major spectroscopic surveys available. We use this dataset
to probe the kinematics of the disc in 3-dimensions, i.e., in the in-
dividual Galactocentric velocity components as well as in the line-
of-sight component. We subtract an axisymmetric model for each
component and analyse the velocity ﬂuctuations and the power spec-
trum in each. We compare our ﬁndings to a simulation of disrupting
spiral arms, and oﬀer a few possible scenarios for the patterns ob-
served in the data.

2 DATASETS:

2.1 Observational: Astrometry & Radial velocities

Fortunately, in addition to Gaia RVS, we also have access to sev-
eral ongoing spectroscopic surveys with publicly available radial
velocities. These supplementary measurements vary in their sky
coverage, magnitude and also precision, but in combination with
the RVS, allow one to create an extended radial velocity sample
(xRVS) with high precision astrometry from Gaia. In particular, we
crossmatch within a radius of 5 arcsec, the Gaia EDR3 catalogue
with data from, the LAMOST DR6 Low Resolution (LR, Wang et al.
2020), and Medium resolution (MR, Liu et al. 2019) surveys, RAVE
DR6 (Steinmetz et al. 2020), GALAH DR3 (Buder et al. 2021),
APOGEE DR16 (Ahumada et al. 2020), and SEGUE DR10 (Ahn
et al. 2014). On top of this, as recommended by the LAMOST DR6
release note1, we apply a +7.9 km s−1 oﬀset to the LAMOST LR
velocities. For those stars, where Gaia DR2 RVS is unavailable, we
assign radial velocities in the following order: GALAH, APOGEE,
RAVE, LAMOST, and ﬁnally, SEGUE. This is in accordance with
the typical accuracy of the line-of-sight velocity by these spectro-
scopic surveys. Our initial xRVS consists of 10,828,676 stars in all,
and the distribution by survey is shown in Figure 1. Our dataset is
dominated by radial velocities from Gaia DR2, followed by LAM-
OST 𝐿𝑅, and then the remaining surveys. The typical uncertainty in
the radial velocities (𝜎𝑉los ) from LAMOST 𝐿𝑅, tends to be around 7
km s−1 (Li et al. 2021), which is much higher than that in the other
surveys. Thus, we restrict our sample to 𝜎𝑉los

< 7 km s−1.

Despite the high quality of data, systematics and spurious as-
trometry have been identiﬁed in Gaia (Fabricius et al. 2021). These
can usually be ﬁltered out using quality parameters such as the re-
normalised unit weight error (RUWE), astrometric_excess_noise ,
visibility_periods_used , and others. Rybizki et al. (2022) showed
that such simple ﬁltering does not necessarily remove spurious
sources. They trained a neural network classiﬁer on selected qual-
ity ﬁlters using high and low signal-to-noise data, and provide
’Astrometric-ﬁdelity (AF)’ for the entire Gaia EDR3 dataset, such
that 0 (bad) < AF < 1 (good), with AF = 0.5 roughly dividing the
two regimes. The distribution of Astrometric-ﬁdelity for our xRVS
dataset is shown in Figure 2, where over 90% of sources lie above
the AF = 0.5 threshold and have ’good’ astrometry available. For
all our analysis we thus discard data with AF < 0.5. Furthermore,

normalised distribution of 𝑉los from the individual surveys. Panel (b) shows that most of the radial velocities are from Gaia DR2, followed by LAMOST, and
then the remaining surveys.

2.2 Simulations: phase-mixing of Spiral arms

The Gaia dataset has revealed rich kinematic substructure in the
Galaxy. These features have been linked to both internal (due to
action of the Galactic bar & spiral arms) and external (such as ac-
cretion events) sources of perturbations. In Khanna et al. (2019,
K19 hereafter), we showed that phase-mixing triggered by disrupt-
ing spiral arms can explain some of the the phase space structures
discovered with Gaia DR2 data, in particular, the diagonal ridges
visible in the (𝑅, 𝑉𝜙) plane and arches in the (𝑉𝑅, 𝑉𝜙) plane. Given
that these features are present on large physical scales of several kpc,
it is interesting to explore what the signatures of such phenomena
are present in the peculiar velocity ﬁeld. The full details related to
the setup of the simulation are given in K19. Brieﬂy, we setup test
particles in the conﬁguration of four Archimedean spirals. The ra-
dial velocity was sampled from N (0, 20), and the azimuthal velocity
from N (Θ(𝑅), 20), where Θ(𝑅) denotes the circular velocity and N
denotes a Gaussian distribution. For simplicity, the particles were
all setup to be in the plane of the model galaxy, and thus also have
zero vertical velocity. A total of 640000 particles were evolved for
650 Myr (in timesteps of 6 Myr) in the MWPotential2014 potential
using the galpy package (Bovy 2015). We compare the simulation
to observed data in subsection 4.2.

3 METHODS

3.1 Coordinate transformations

Throughout this paper, we adopt a right-handed coordinate frame in
which the Sun is placed at a Galactocentric distance of 𝑅 (cid:12) = 8.275
kpc. This is consistent with the latest ESO Gravity measurement,
of the orbit of the star S2 around the Milky Way’s supermassive
black hole (Gravity Collaboration et al. 2021). The Sun thus has
Galactocentric coordinates (𝑋, 𝑌 , 𝑍) = (−8.275, 0, 0.25) kpc. The
cylindrical coordinate angle 𝜙 = tan−1 (𝑌 /𝑋) increases in the anti-
clockwise direction, while the rotation of the Galaxy is clockwise.
The heliocentric Cartesian frame is related to Galactocentric by

Figure 2. Astrometric ﬁdelity (AF) for the xRVS sample. AF above 0.5
corresponds to good astrometric solutions, and nearly all of our dataset
satisﬁes this condition.

we restrict our sample to 𝜎𝜛 /𝜛 < 0.2, in order to estimate dis-
tances by inverting the parallax (𝜛), to which we also apply the
recommended zero-point oﬀset of 0.017 mas. Thus after applying
our quality ﬁlters on the radial velocities, and astrometry, our ﬁnal
xRVS dataset consists of 𝑁 = 9, 407, 060 sources in total. We restrict
our sample to be within a heliocentric distance of 3.5 kpc.

In order to correctly propagate the uncertainties in the var-
ious astrometric quantities, we make use of the set of correla-
tion coeﬃcients between astrometric parameters (ra, dec, parallax,
pm_ra, pm_dec) provided in Gaia EDR3 (Lindegren et al. 2021).
By combining the correlation coeﬃcients (given as ‘ra_pmra_corr’,
’dec_pmra_corr etc), with the standard uncertainties in each (e.g.,
’ra_error’, ’dec_error’ etc), we construct a covariance matrix, and
sample 20 times from this using a multivariate normal distribution.
The radial velocity uncertainties are also included in the matrix,
however, we assume these to have zero correlation with the astrom-
etry.

𝑋hc = 𝑋 + 𝑅 (cid:12), 𝑌hc = 𝑌 and 𝑍hc = 𝑍. 𝑋hc is negative toward
ℓ = 180◦ and 𝑌hc is positive towards Galactic rotation. For trans-
forming velocities between heliocentric and Galactocentric frames
we use ( (cid:164)𝑋(cid:12), (cid:164)𝑌(cid:12), (cid:164)𝑍 (cid:12)) = (𝑈(cid:12), Ω(cid:12) 𝑅 (cid:12), 𝑊(cid:12)). Following Schönrich
et al. (2010), we adopt (𝑈, 𝑊) (cid:12) = (11.1, 7.25) km s−1, while for
the azimuthal component we use the constraint of Ω(cid:12) = 30.24 km
s−1kpc−1, which is set by the proper motion of Sgr A*, i.e., the Sun’s
angular velocity around the Galactic center (Reid & Brunthaler
2004). This sets the azimuthal velocity of the Sun to 𝑉𝜙, (cid:12) = −250
km s−1, rounded to three signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

3.2 Axisymmetric model and peculiar velocity maps

Our goal is to quantify the deviations in the motion of individual
stars, with respect to a mean ordered 3D velocity ﬁeld. To achieve
this, we ﬁrst construct a simple axisymmetric model, assuming
that the mean rotational motion, 𝑉𝜙,mod, is a function only of 𝑅,
and |𝑧|. Additionally, we also assume equilibrium in the other two
components, such that, 𝑉𝑅,mod = 0, and 𝑉𝑧,mod = 0. The 𝑉𝜙,mod,
can be constructed in two diﬀerent ways, a) by dividing the data
into thin vertical slices in 𝑧, and interpolating the rotation curve
as a function of 𝑅; or alternatively, b) we can follow the approach
as in K18, where we take into account the vertical gradient in the
azimuthal velocity, by ﬁtting a 2D polynomial, such as,

𝑉𝜙,mod (𝑅, 𝑍) =

2
∑︁

2
∑︁

𝑖=0

𝑗=0

𝑎𝑖 𝑗 (𝑅 − 𝑅 (cid:12))𝑖 𝑍 𝑗 .

(1)

This Galactocentric model is then transformed to the helio-
centric frame, again using ( (cid:164)𝑋(cid:12), (cid:164)𝑌(cid:12), (cid:164)𝑍 (cid:12)) = (𝑈(cid:12), Ω(cid:12) 𝑅 (cid:12), 𝑊(cid:12)), as
described in subsection 3.1.

Thus, we can subtract oﬀ for each star, 𝑖, the mean motion
in the four velocity components, 𝑉𝜙,𝑅,𝑧,los, in order to obtain the
peculiar velocity, Δ𝑉𝑖 = 𝑉𝑖 − 𝑉𝑖,mod. We divide the data into three
slices in |𝑧|, namely, a) midslice: |𝑧|/[kpc] < 0.25, b) upperslice:
0.25 < |𝑧|/[kpc] < 0.5, and, c) topslice: 0.5 < |𝑧|/[kpc] < 0.75. In
each |𝑧| slice, then, we present maps of the residual velocity ﬁeld, by
binning up stars in the (𝑥, 𝑦) plane, with a resolution of 0.25 × 0.25
kpc2. In order to minimise the Poisson noise, we require a minimum
number of 100 stars per pixel, and call this quantity, 𝑁𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑏𝑖𝑛. This
ensures that the standard error in the mean velocity is well below 1
km s−1 per pixel. Our data slicing, binning, and coordinate system,
are illustrated in the number density maps shown in Figure 3.

3.3 Fourier analysis

In order to further characterise the non-axisymmetric motion in the
Galaxy, we perform Fourier analysis on the peculiar velocity maps.
If 𝐴kl is the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the image ℎ (our
maps in xy plane) and Δ𝑥 and Δ𝑦 are the size of the bins along the
𝑥 and 𝑦 directions, the 2D power spectrum of the peculiar velocity
ﬁeld is then given by

𝑃𝑘𝑙 =

1
𝑁eﬀ

| 𝐴kl|2Δ𝑥Δ𝑦.

(2)

Here 𝑁eﬀ = (cid:205)𝑖 (cid:205) 𝑗 𝐻 (𝑛𝑖 𝑗 − 100) is the eﬀective number of bins in
the image, where 𝐻 is the Heaviside step function and 𝑛𝑖 𝑗 is the
number of stars in the (𝑖, 𝑗)-th bin. Next, we average 𝑃𝑘𝑙 azimuthally
in bins of 𝑘 =
𝑦, to obtain the 1D power spectrum 𝑃(𝑘).

𝑘2
𝑥 + 𝑘2

√︃

The 𝑃(𝑘), as deﬁned above satisﬁes the following normalization

Therefore, √︁𝑃(𝑘) that has dimensions of km s−1 and denotes
the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations. The presented formalism ensures
that the estimated power spectrum 𝑃(𝑘) is invariant to the changes
in the sizes of the bins, to the changes to the overall size of the
image box, and to bins with missing data. Finally, we locate the
coordinates (𝑘, √︁𝑃(𝑘)) of the peak(s) in our power spectrum, using
the scipy.signal.ﬁnd_peaks2 routine.

Noise: To illustrate the robustness of our results, we also com-
pute the power spectrum of a peculiar velocity ﬁeld consisting purely
of noise. For this, we generate 100 random images, where, the value
in each pixel of an image is sampled from a normal distribution
with zero mean and dispersion equal to one standard deviation of
the residual velocity (Δ𝑉𝑖) in each pixel of the real image. Follow-
ing this, we compute the power spectrum for each noise image, and
from the sample, we obtain the power at the 50𝑡 ℎ (median), 84𝑡 ℎ,
and 16𝑡 ℎ percentiles, and thus the spread due to noise.

Uncertainties: Propagating uncertainties from the physical to
the Fourier space is not a trivial exercise. So, in order to estimate the
uncertainty in the amplitude √︁𝑃(𝑘), we compute the power spec-
trum for 20 random data realisations, sampled from a multivariate
Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix given by the errors
and correlation from the Gaia EDR3 catalogue, as described in
section 2. From this, we again use the power at the 50𝑡 ℎ (median),
84𝑡 ℎ, and 16𝑡 ℎ percentiles, and thus the spread due to uncertainties
in our observables.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Data: Combined vertical slices

4.1.1 Residual velocity maps

We ﬁrst apply our method to slices in |𝑧|, i.e., where data in symmet-
ric slices (above and below the Galactic plane) has been combined.
The best ﬁtting parameters for Equation 1 are listed in section B, and
the ﬁt itself is illustrated in Figure 4, for the individual |𝑧| slices. In
Figure 5, we show the 2D heliocentric (𝑥𝑦) maps of velocity residu-
als (Δ𝑉𝑖) in the four components, i.e., 𝑉𝜙,R,z,los. Figure 5(a-d) shows
the maps for the midslice, Figure 5(e-h) shows the upperslice, and,
Figure 5(i-l) shows the topslice. Moving from top to bottom in this
scheme is thus akin to moving away from the Galactic plane.

First, looking at the the midslice, it is immediately clear that the
residual velocity ﬁeld is not smooth across at least three components,
i.e., 𝑉𝜙,R,los. There are regions of high |Δ𝑉𝑖 |, that span across
several pixels, and translate to a physical scale of 100s of parsecs.
The magnitude of the |Δ𝑉𝑖 | is of the order of 10 km s−1, in the 𝑉R,los
components, and about 5 km s−1 in the 𝑉𝜙 component. On the other
hand, Figure 5(c) shows that the Δ𝑉𝑖 map in the 𝑉𝑧 component, has a
relatively smoother distribution, and shows a clear positive Δ𝑉𝑖 with
a magnitude of about 5 km s−1, towards the outer disc. In addition to

in Figure 5(e) appears smoother compared to Figure 5(a). The large
scale features in the Δ𝑉𝑅 component, in Figure 5(f) are also not too
dissimilar to that in Figure 5(b), however, we do note the absence
of the peculiar pixels seen in the midslice. In the Δ𝑉𝑧 component,
shown in Figure 5(g), the positive residuals towards the outer disc
are more prominent compared to Figure 5(c). Overall, the maps in
the upperslice retain the large scale features seen in the midslice,
but appear smoother.

Finally, for the topslice, in Figure 5(i-l) we notice that the
peculiar pixels are completely absent, and the velocity residuals
appear spread over an even larger area compared to the two lower |𝑧|
slices. In all three |𝑧| slices, the Δ𝑉los map shows a superposition of
features in the other three components 𝑉𝜙,R,z. This is not surprising,
given that the other components all contribute towards the line-of-
sight velocity. As a consequence of this, the component with the
highest velocity residuals dominates the Δ𝑉los map.

Using parallaxes and proper motions of masers, from the
BESSEL survey, Reid et al. (2019) built a log-periodic model of
the Galactic spiral arms. Using the model (their Table 2.), in each
panel in Figure 5, we overplot the heliocentric positions of the main
arms: Norma-Outer (Norma hereafter), Perseus, Local, Sagittarius-
Carina arm (Sgt-Car hereafter), and Scutum-Centaurus-OSC arm
(Sct-Cen hereafter). We ignore the thickness of the arms, as this
would make the maps diﬃcult to read. The mean locations of the
arms shows that the Norma arm (in red) lies just outside the ex-
tent of our data selection. There is however, a signiﬁcant overlap
between the other four spiral arms and the data. In particular, we
note in Figure 5(b,f,j), the presence of a strong gradient in the Δ𝑉𝑅
component along 𝑌hc = 0, that lies exactly at the location of the
Perseus arm (in black). The gradient gets weaker with |𝑧|, but is
still present in the highest slice. Interestingly, the positive residuals

as near (𝑋hc = −0.9, 𝑌hc = 1.2), and (𝑋hc = −2.5, 𝑌hc = 0), in

pixels are clearly still present even after reduced Poisson noise.

For the intermediate region, i.e., upperslice, the features are
largely unchanged compared to the midslice. The Δ𝑉𝜙 component

the Δ𝑉𝑅 component is on average +ve. Finally, the resultant Δ𝑉los
component also has a positive feature near the location of the local
arm.

4.1.2 Power spectrum

Next, in Figure 6, we show the power spectrum of the Δ𝑉𝑖 in each ve-
locity component, and for each of the three |𝑧| slices. For each veloc-
ity component, we mark the position of the ‘peak’ in the power spec-
trum, with a black cross. Additionally, the coordinates (𝑘, √︁𝑃(𝑘))
of the peaks, are also included in the plot labels. The typical 1𝜎
uncertainty on √︁𝑃(𝑘) is of the order of 0.2 km s−1. Lastly, the top
axes in each panel plots the quantity, 1/𝑘, in order to give a sense of
the physical scale associated with the peaks in the power spectrum.
Looking at the the midslice ﬁrst, and considering only the
values of the peaks in the power spectrum, Figure 6(a) shows that

the peak is highest in the 𝑉𝑅 component (√︁𝑃(𝑘) = 8.5 km s−1),
and lowest in the 𝑉𝑧 component (√︁𝑃(𝑘) = 2.6 km s−1). The peak
in the 𝑉los component is smaller than the dominant component
(𝑉𝑅), with a value of √︁𝑃(𝑘) = 4.6 km s−1. Lastly, the peak in
the 𝑉𝜙 component, is at √︁𝑃(𝑘) = 4.2 km s−1. With the power
spectrum we also have the location of the peaks in 𝑘 or real (1/𝑘)
space. In the midslice, most of the power is concentrated between
wavenumbers, 0.2 < 𝑘 < 0.4, corresponding to physical scales
between, 5 > 1/𝑘 > 2.5 kpc. In particular, we note that the peak in
the 𝑉𝑅 component is more concentrated (at high wavenumber, low
physical scale ∼ 2.5 kpc) ompared to the broader peaks in the 𝑉𝜙
& 𝑉𝑧 components. This corroborates the ﬁndings in Figure 5(a-d),
where the maps of Δ𝑉𝑖 were visually smoother for the 𝑉𝜙 & 𝑉𝑧
components, compared to the 𝑉𝑅 component.

In the upperslice, in Figure 6(b), the patterns are not too dis-
similar from the midslice, in that, once again, the peak in the power
spectrum is the highest in the 𝑉𝑅 component (√︁𝑃(𝑘) = 7.9 km

Figure 6. Power spectrum of velocity residuals, Δ𝑉𝑖, for the combined (|𝑧 |) slices, corresponding to the kinematic maps shown in Figure 5. The quantities in
brackets denote the coordinates (wavenumber 𝑘, power √︁𝑃 (𝑘)) of the peak in each component, marked with a black cross. In the midslice, the highest power
is in the 𝑉𝑅 (radial) component, and the lowest is in the 𝑉𝑧 component. As we go above the plane, the amplitude drops in all components except for in the 𝑉𝑧
component. The radial streaming motion dominates in all |𝑧 | slices. The proﬁle with the dashed line shows the power spectrum expected due to noise, and is
essentially negligible.

s−1). The power in the 𝑉𝜙 component (√︁𝑃(𝑘) = 4.0 km s−1), is
very slightly lower than that in the midslice, but the location of
the peak has shifted slightly towards lower wavenumbers. However,
given the broad distribution of these peaks, we caution against using
the peak locations as strict values. In general, though, the power in
the 𝑉𝑅 component is still dominant and more concentrated in this
intermediate |𝑧| slice. It is interesting to note, also, that the values
of the peaks have dropped for the 𝑉𝑅 and 𝑉𝜙 components, while
increasing in the 𝑉𝑧 component. Furthermore, the peak in the 𝑉los
has also increased by 0.7 km s−1. This is most likely a consequence
of the combination of the high power in both 𝑉𝑅 and 𝑉𝑧 contributing
towards the 𝑉los component.

Finally, for the topslice, Figure 6(c) shows that while the peak
power is still the highest in the 𝑉𝑅 component (√︁𝑃(𝑘) = 6.9 km
s−1), the peak in the 𝑉𝑧 component is now at its maximum (√︁𝑃(𝑘) =
5.2 km s−1). Furthermore, the distribution of the power spectrum
in the 𝑉𝑧 component is also more concentrated compared to the
lower two |𝑧| slices. The power in the 𝑉𝜙 component has reduced
to √︁𝑃(𝑘) = 1.9 km s−1, and the proﬁle is ﬂat across 𝑘. The 𝑉los
component is highest (√︁𝑃(𝑘) = 6.4 km s−1) compared to the lower
two slices, and follows closely the amplitude of the 𝑉𝑅 and the 𝑉𝑧
components. The evolution of the peak power in each component
with height above the plane is illustrated in Figure 7.

4.2 Comparison with phase-mixing simulation

We now use the simulation run by K19 to explore the residual
velocity ﬁeld in the scenario where disrupting spiral arms is a source
of perturbation, and phase-mixing as the Galaxy relaxes, produces
the kinematic structures such as ridges and arches seen in Gaia DR2.
We carry out the analysis described in section 3, in exactly the same
manner as for the observed data, except that since our simulated
particles are all conﬁned to the plane, we limit our comparison to
the midslice only, and likewise, since there is no vertical motion in
the simulation, we only consider the three components 𝑉 (𝜙, 𝑅, los).
For each timestep, we produce maps of velocity residuals similar

increases.

to Figure 5. Our simulation is by no means supposed to be a one-
to-one comparison with the Milky Way, but for the purpose of a
simple comparison, we handpick two snapshots, one at an early
stage (230 Myr), and another at a later stage (487 Myr) of the
phase-mixing process. In Figure 8, we present the Δ𝑉𝑖 maps for
these two snapshots, and compare it to the midslice maps in the data.

shows the Δ𝑉𝑖 at 230 Myr. At this early time, there are very high
residuals (both -ve and +ve), present in the three components, and
these manifest as broad diagonal features. Interestingly, the radial
(Δ𝑉𝑅) component seems to dominate in the simulation as well, and
as in the data, the Δ𝑉𝑙𝑜𝑠 component follows most of the pattern
of the radial component. In comparison, at later times (487 Myr),
Figure 8(g-i) shows that the residuals are now conﬁned in much
thinner stripes, and the amplitude also seems lower. Notwithstanding
the caveat that our simulation is not selection-function matched, our
crude qualitative comparison, does however show that the diagonal
residuals seen in the data have a similar appearance to that noted in
Figure 8(g-i).

As was done for the observed data, we also produce a power
spectrum of Δ𝑉𝑖 for the selected snapshots. Figure 9(a,d) reproduce
the power spectrum of the data in the midslice, Figure 9(b,e) presents
the power at 230 Myr, and Figure 9(c,f) at 487 Myr in the simulation.
At 230 Myr, Figure 9(b) shows that the power is dominated by the
Δ𝑉𝑅 component (peak at √︁𝑃(𝑘) = 29.7 km s−1), and is much higher
than the peak power in the Δ𝑉𝜙 component (√︁𝑃(𝑘) = 8.5 km s−1).
At 487 Myr, Figure 9(c), the peaks have dropped to √︁𝑃(𝑘) = 9.7 km
s−1 in the Δ𝑉𝑅 component, and to √︁𝑃(𝑘) = 5.2 km s−1 in the Δ𝑉𝜙
component. Furthermore, the peaks seem to have shifted to smaller
physical scales, for example in the Δ𝑉𝑅 component, the peaks shift
from 1/𝑘 = 2.5 kpc (at 230 Myr), to 1/𝑘 = 1.4 kpc (at 487 Myr).
Our simulation is setup as a 4-arm spiral Galaxy, however, we can
also restrict to using only a 2-arm setup. The results in this scenario
are presented in Figure 9(e-f). This seems to have two clear eﬀects,
i.e., at a given snapshot a) the amplitudes of the peak power in each
component is higher in the 2-arm model, b) the peaks shift slightly
onto larger physical scales. The physical scale of the peaks at 487
Myr, in the 2-arm model, are a closer match to the observed data.

Lastly, in Figure 10, we plot the peak power (panel a) and
the corresponding physical scale (panel b) in the components
𝑉 (𝜙, 𝑅, los), at each snapshot through the simulation. Overall, as
the mock Galaxy relaxes following the initial perturbation, the peak
in the power spectrum drops to lower amplitudes, and also shifts
towards smaller physical scales with time. Detailed simulations of
the Galaxy could perhaps match such properties of the current mea-
sured power spectra in order to time various perturbation events in
the Milky Way’s history.

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 The Local Standard of rest

We have explored the non-axisymmetric motions of stars out to 3.5
kpc from the Sun, using a dataset with high-precision 6D phase-
space. The maps of velocity residuals reveal large bulk ﬂow in
the Galactocentric Radial direction, and also non-negligible bulk
motion in the azimuthal and the vertical directions. This is the ﬁrst
time the velocity residuals in a large volume have been quantiﬁed
in the individual components. This is thanks to the availability of
high precision proper motion and line-of-sight velocities from the
Gaia survey. Previous studies mapping the large scale kinematics
of the disc were mostly restricted to the line-of-sight velocities to
deduce the global motion. In K18, using Red Clump giants, we
showed that the peak power in the Δ𝑉los component was about
6.3 km s−1 in the midslice. This value seems to be a little higher
than our new estimate of 4.6 km s−1, as shown in Figure 6(a).
However, we can now also note that the line-of-sight velocities do
not tell the complete story, and that the residuals are very high in

Spiral arms. The values for each arm are taken from Castro-Ginard et al.
(2021), where we have averaged over all ages, and also shown in the brackets,

the Galactocentric radial direction. Away from the plane, in K18
we found the peak power in Δ𝑉los to be about 5 km s−1, however,
due to the sparse data coverage, our measurements were largely
consistent with noise. Figure 6 shows that the residuals in the line-
of-sight velocity in the midslice and the upper slices only diﬀer by
about 1 km s−1, but thanks to the resolved components, we can
now understand why this is the case. The contribution from the
azimuthal streaming motion decreases with an increase in height
above the plane, but this is compensated by the increase in residuals
in the vertical component, while the radial component does not
decrease sharply. If the principle mechanism responsible for the
streaming motion are features such as the Spiral arms of the Galaxy,
our results suggest a strong coupling between the in-plane and out-
of plane motions, and that these extend out to around 1 kpc from
the midplane.

B15, also used red clump giants, and had found that the power
spectrum for the Δ𝑉los component can be minimized for a choice
of 𝑉𝜙, (cid:12) − 𝑉𝑐, (cid:12) =22.5 km s−1, i.e., for a value about 10 km s−1
higher than the local standard of rest suggested by Schönrich et al.
(2010). The peak of the their power spectrum was of the order of this
diﬀerence of 10 km s−1, and they attributed this to the amplitude of
the streaming motion in the disc. Our estimates of the peak power
are still lower by about a factor of 2, compared to B15. In particular
we note that the maximum power in the Δ𝑉𝜙 component does not
exceed 4.2 km s−1, and so in contrast with B15, we ﬁnd that the local
standard of rest value for the azimuthal Solar peculiar velocity does
not require a massive but perhaps a moderate revision. However,
given the signiﬁcant residuals in the radial direction, a revision of
that component certainly does not seem unreasonable.

As demonstration of

the high quality astrometry from
Gaia EDR3, Gaia Collaboration et al. (2021c) used the apparent
proper motion of about 1.6 million quasar-like objects, to directly
determine that the centripetal acceleration at the Solar System is
𝛼 = 5.05 ± 0.35𝜇as 𝑦𝑟−1. Right after, Bovy (2020) neatly combined
this result, with typical values for 𝑅 (cid:12) and ΩSgr (proper motion of
Sgr A*), to derive 𝑉(cid:12) = 8.0 ± 8.4 km s−1. While this independent
determination of the Solar peculiar velocity is largely in agreement
with that by Schönrich et al. (2010), the uncertainties on the accel-
eration are at present too high. Nevertheless, this value would also
support that the streaming motion in the azimuthal direction is not
very high, as we ﬁnd in our power spectrum analysis.

5.2 Connection to Spiral arms

In Figure 5, on the velocity residual maps, we overplotted the loca-
tion of the main spiral arms in the Milky Way according to recent
models. The concurrence of the proﬁle of a few of the arms and pat-
terns in velocity residuals is interesting to note. For decades there

(panels a-c), and our Phase-mixing simulation from Khanna et al. (2019), at 𝜏 = 230 Myr (panels d-f), and at 𝜏 = 487 Myr (panels g-i). In all three cases, the
residuals are highest in the Δ𝑉𝑅 component. At later stages in the simulation, the Δ𝑉𝑖 pattern seems to appear like that in the observed data.

has been a long standing debate over the nature of the Spiral arms
in the Galaxy, and broadly speaking, there are two competing the-
ories. In the standard density wave theory proposed by Lin & Shu
(1964), the spiral arms are treated as static density waves that move
through the disc with their own pattern speed and are long-lived.
The gas and stars in the disc are then slowed down in the arms due
to gravitational attraction. Such spiral arms (called Lin-Shu type)
cannot be material arms, otherwise they would quickly wind up due
to diﬀerential rotation and thus break up. On the other hand, is the
idea of Flocculent spiral arms, that are local overdensities that coro-
tate with the disc, and over time shear due to diﬀerential rotation.
These can also be generated by non static or transient density waves,
for example, D’Onghia et al. (2013) showed that Giant molecular
clouds (GMC) can generate self-perpetuating spiral arms.

Since we only see the Milky Way edge on we cannot directly
observe the spiral arms. However, through a combination of long
baseline interferometry (e.g., with the VLBI), accurate parallax and
proper motions have been measured for MASERS in high mass star
forming regions, which have broadly been able to map the mutliple
arms in the Milky Way, such as the model by Reid et al. (2019)
that we overplot in Figure 5. With the availability of high precision
6D phase space for a large number of stars, there have been no-
table recent eﬀorts in using the dynamics of stars to map the spiral
arms in the Milky Way. One of these methods exploits the kine-

MNRAS 000, 1–12 (2022)

matic and age information of Open Clusters. The basic assumption
is that Open Clusters are born in Spiral arms. By integrating back-
wards, the orbits of present day Open cluster members, the cluster
reveals the position of a spiral arm at a past time equal to its age.
And by integrating the orbits forward from their birth location, the
present day Spiral arm locations can be compared to their analytical
predictions. Two recent works have implemented this method, but
ﬁnd completely opposite results. Using Gaia DR2 data, Dias et al.
(2019) ﬁnd that the pattern speed of the main spiral arms in the
Galaxy are all consistent with each other and have a value around
Ω 𝑝 = 28.2 km s−1 kpc−1. In contrast, using a much larger, and
more recently updated list of Open Clusters, Castro-Ginard et al.
(2021) ﬁnd that individual arms diﬀer quite a bit in their pattern
speeds, and are also able to derive an age-dependence on Ω 𝑝. We
have compiled the results from the two works in Table 1, where
we also include an estimate for the Co-rotation radius of each arm.
According to Dias et al. (2019), the Solar neighbourhood is well
inside the corotation of all the arms, since they all share the same
pattern speed. On the contrary, according to Castro-Ginard et al.
(2021), only the Perseus and Sgt-Car arms have their corotation
radius beyond the Solar neighbourhood.

dict the global stellar response to spiral perturbations in the Galactic

this is shown for a 2-arm spiral model. In such a 2-arm conﬁguration, the shift in the peak power is smaller compared to that in the 4-arm model. In all cases,

creting satellite). They integrate stellar orbits in a 2-arm Lin-Shu
type spiral potential and produce maps of mean Galactocentric ra-
dial velocity (𝑉𝑅). They show (their ﬁgure 6.) that inside corotation,
in the region traced by the arm, the mean 𝑉𝑅 is negative (of the order
of -7 km s−1), i.e., stars exhibit bulk motion towards the Galactic
center. Meanwhile, in the region between the arms, the stellar radial
motion is positive, i.e., stars exhibit bulk motion towards the anti-
center. Outside corotation, the pattern is reversed. In Figure 5(b),
the local arm clearly overlaps with a region of negative Δ𝑉𝑅. More-
over, adjacent to this is also present, a strong positive Δ𝑉𝑅 feature
that also runs from positive to negative 𝑌hc. If we assume the ﬁxed
pattern speed of the Galactic spiral arms as suggested by Dias et al.
(2019), this would place corotation at 8.9 kpc, i.e., well beyond the
position of the local arm (8.26 kpc). Then the simulations by Faure
et al. (2014) can explain the patterns observed around the Solar
neighbourhood. On the other hand, according to the individual arm
pattern speeds from Castro-Ginard et al. (2021), only the Perseus,
and the Sgt-Car arms have a corotation radius beyond the position of
the local arm, and so in that case the Faure et al. (2014) model does
not ﬁt the observed pattern around 8.26 kpc. Furthermore, along the
Perseus arm, the Δ𝑉𝑅 shows a gradient across the 𝑌hc = 0 line, not
seen in the Faure et al. (2014) maps. The Perseus arm also shows

a correlation between the radial and the vertical velocity residuals,
so the two might be connected in this region.

A full exploration of the role of the Spiral arms is beyond the
scope of this paper, nevertheless, it is interesting to note this overlap
of patterns in the velocity residuals and the spiral arm locations, and
the diversity of the patterns itself, could be hinting at the diﬀerent
nature of the arms involved. While some of the velocity residuals
could be due to resonant features such as those predicted by Faure
et al. (2014), disrupting/transient spiral arms such as those in our
phase-mixing simulation could also have a signiﬁcant contribution.

6 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Using a large dataset of about 10 million stars, with 6D phase-space
information, we have characterised the velocity ﬁeld in the Galactic
disc out to 3.5 kpc from the Sun. We subtracted axisymmetric
models in the individual velocity components, 𝑉𝜙,𝑉𝑅,𝑉𝑧, and 𝑉los,
and performed Fourier analysis to determine the amplitude and
physical scale of streaming motion in the disc. We ﬁnd that the
streaming motion is dominant in the 𝑉𝑅 component, and does not
show too much variance with Galactic height |𝑧|. The streaming in

Figure 10. Time evolution of peak power (panel a), and the corresponding physical scale (panel v) in the components 𝑉 ( 𝜙, 𝑅, los) for the phase-mixing
simulation. Panel (a) shows that the peak in each component drops with time, and that the 𝑉𝑅 component dominates at all times. Panel (b) shows that the
physical scale of the peaks shifts from higher to lower values with time. A time interval of about 50 Myr is used in the plots. Essentially, as the mock Galaxy
relaxes, the streaming motion occurs on smaller scales and with smaller amplitude.

in the 𝑉𝑧 component, is also lower than in 𝑉𝑅, but increases with
|𝑧|, likely reﬂecting the signature of the Galactic warp. The physical
scale of the power spectrum implies that the Solar neighbourhood is
participating on a large scale streaming motion, and this could have
potential implications on the currently assumed Local Standard of
Rest. We also ﬁnd that the predicted location of spiral arms seem
to correlate with the patterns observed in the velocity ﬁeld, and
particularly interesting are the correlations between the in-plane
and out of plane velocity components. Finally, our test particle
simulation of phase-mixing of disrupting spiral arms oﬀers one,
of a multitude of physical scenarios that could be causing such
streaming motion in the disc.

In the very near future, Gaia DR3 will expand the radial ve-
locity dataset by a factor of four, to 32 million sources3. Addition-
ally, the survey will also make public Astrophysical parameters for
nearly 500 million sources. This will be a truly unprecedented and
invaluable chemodynamic dataset that could help piece together the
interplay between various structural components and the large scale
kinematic processes underway in the Milky Way.
