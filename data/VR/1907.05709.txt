Frequency Ablations for Various Needle Geometries and
Locations

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract Purpose: Radio-frequency ablations play an important role in the
therapy of malignant liver lesions. The navigation of a needle to the lesion
poses a challenge for both the trainees and intervening physicians.
Methods: This publication presents a new GPU-based, accurate method for the
simulation of radio-frequency ablations for lesions at the needle tip in general
and for an existing visuo-haptic 4D VR simulator. The method is implemented
real-time capable with Nvidia CUDA.
Results: It performs better than a literature method concerning the theoretical
characteristic of monotonic convergence of the bioheat PDE and a in vitro
gold standard with signiﬁcant improvements (p < 0.05) in terms of Pearson
correlations. It shows no failure modes or theoretically inconsistent individual
simulation results after the initial phase of 10 seconds. On the Nvidia 1080 Ti
GPU it achieves a very high frame rendering performance of >480 Hz.
Conclusion: Our method provides a more robust and safer real-time ablation
planning and intraoperative guidance technique, especially avoiding the over-
estimation of the ablated tissue death zone, which is risky for the patient in
terms of tumor recurrence. Future in vitro measurements and optimization
shall further improve the conservative estimate.

1 Introduction

Niclas Kath∗ et al.

In liver cancer therapy besides the conservatively used open laparotomy [9,
30], there are several options for the treatment of primary liver tumors.

The oral endoscopic access is chosen for lesion in or at the main ducts (e.g.
CHD). The minimally invasive laparoscopic access (endoscopic keyhole surgery)
is favorable for peripheral liver boundary tumors. For smaller tumors in the
vicinity of hepatic arteries, the minimally invasive and lower-risk radio-frequency
ablation (RFA) [3] is possible (Fig. 1a). RFA is the most common [9] and
geometrically ﬂexible ablation technique (see Fig. 1b) for focal tumors and
therefore is the basis of this work. A needle containing an electrode is used to
access the target, and the electrode is used to emit high frequency currents to
the needle tip. Fluoroscopy or ultrasound [23] image guidance helps to navi-
gate the tip to the target lesion. Compared to open laparotomy, the survival
chance is only 2% worse [30]. The long chained proteins of the cells disintegrate
leading to the tissue ablation. Clinically, total necrosis instantaneously occurs
at temperatures below −40 ◦C (cryoablation) or exceeding 60 ◦C for most cell
types [28].

Uncommonly used, microwave ablation is a rather new technique which heats
tissue around a coil in the tip to remove cancer tissue [26]. Radiation tip
brachytherapy is more common in the lower abdomen targeting the cervix or
prostate [22,21]. The treatment of spherical or ellipsoidal tumours is faster,
subject to shorter ﬂuoroscopy exposition and more painless [2] with cryother-
apy [12], which destroys tumour cells with ice crystals from quick freezing
and thawing [29]. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is another treat-
ment option (yet more side eﬀects) for rather small or otherwise unresectable
tumours extending the lifetime of patients [15]. Laser ablation based on dis-
persed laser light from ﬁbers is another safe and successful thermal ablation
technique [11].

The ablation principle is shown in Fig. 1a. Currents from a radio-freqency
generator heat up the tissue around the needle tip. Within the 4D VR nee-
dle ablation simulator from our group [8,19, 23,16,5,6], we use an eﬃciently
parallel calculable temperature model [31] specialized to liver lesions. The new
GPU-based algorithm also compares qualitatively (patient safety) favorable to
the literature [13,14] and theoretical characteristics. Keep in mind throughout
the rest of the paper in RFA planning, overestimation of the heat zone can be
deadly by ﬁnally leaving residual tumor cells (under-treatment) and the 100%
reproducability of simulations (no statistical errors). Currently, the training of
ablations is carried out in a risky set-up directly on the living patient. How-
ever, VR training and planning simulations such as ours [7,8] are on the rise
and safe over-real-time ablation planning is highly relevant for intraoperative
planning systems.

2 Material and Methods

The calculation of the heat distribution is based on virtual body models, which
essentially consist of segmented 3D CT image data. To better found our argu-
mentation, we ﬁrst show some theoretical thoughts.

2.1 Theoretical Background

The fundamental solution of the second order hyperbolic partial diﬀerential
heat equation (PDE) [4]:

˙T = k∇2T

(1)

describes the temperature T distribution in a solid medium over time. k is a
constant describing the temperature (substance or energy) spread rate. Now,
we can introduce a border condition with an initial point source T (x, 0) =
g(x) = δ(x) of heat at a known position, i.e. 0 with heat 1 ◦C. This is known
as the fundamental heat distribution problem solved by convolution.
The fundamental solution to the above problem is a typical Green’s function:

2.1.1 General Formal Framework

Generally, a linear combination of solutions of other well-known fundamental
problem solutions subject to other elementary initial (IC, initial temperature
distribution) or border conditions (BC, constant heat source) or slight modi-
ﬁcations in the PDE term in Eq. 2 on the right hand side (AT) [4]:






˙T = k · ∂T
T (x, 0) = g(x)
T (0, t) = h(t)

∂x2 + f (x, t) additional terms f (AT)

initial condition (IC)
boundary condition (BC)

(3)

where the ﬁrst line is the fundamental Laplacian with other additive terms
f (x, t), IC corresponds to a initial temperature distribution (later: image) at
time point zero and BC suits to represent a constant heat source h(t) = T0.
In this chapter for brevity, we set g(x) = 0 and concentrate to solve the AT
and BC problems for our needs.
For elaborating just the characteristics, we sum up the math: The solution
with respect to the special terms, set here to f (x, t) = 0, g(x) = 0, h(t) = T0,
is a linear combination of appropriate Green’s function solutions resulting from
the linear operation of convolutions of the type shown in Eq. 2 (Bell curves).
This translates perfect to the characteristic simulation problem of needle ab-
lation, e.g. using a needle tip heat source T (0, t) = h(t) = δ(x) · 90 ◦C. The
solution of the time convolution:

shows monotonic convergence of temperature (Figs. 2b, 2c).

2.1.2 Cell Decay Terms from the Comparison Work

Linte et al. [13] proposed a tissue state decay term based on an inverted
Arrhenius equation:

with symbols c(t) as the healthy cell concentration at time t, R as the univer-
sal gas constant (8.31
mol K ), A as a frequency factor for the kinetic expression
(Hz), ∆E denotes the activation energy for the irreversible cell damage reac-
tion ( J
mol ) and T denotes the tissue temperature (◦C) [13,33]: Damaged tissue
with no cooling by blood ﬂow corresponds to α = 0 at some later time point,
and fully functional tissue is represented by α = 1 at t = 0 as shown in Fig. 3.
α is a monotonically decreasing term from 1 to 0 under-weighting the blood
cooling.

2.2 Specialized Methods for Liver Ablation Simulation

The segmented regions of the virtual bodies [20,17,18] are assigned a structure-
speciﬁc temperature, e.g. a liver blood vessel has a constant temperature of
37 ◦C. The temperature ﬂow in the human body consists of three constituents
[1]: (1) Heat conduction from warm to cold tissue. (2) Cooling by blood ﬂow
[31]. (3) Metabolic heat generation. The model to compare against for tem-
perature propagation using liver ablations in this work is the modiﬁed Bioheat
equation as stated in Linte et al. [13,31]:

Robust GPU-based RFA-Simulation

Assessment of the relevant contribution of diﬀerent terms of Eq. 8 vs. in vitro
experiments [13] has lead us to a more robust simpliﬁed simulation equation
used in this work for liver tumor ablation:

kg ◦C ), t the time (s), K the liver thermal conductivity (0.52 W

The variables denote the resistive heat transfer at Linte’s needle tip σ|(cid:79)V |2
(with V as the electric potential (V)), the blood density ρp ( kg
m3 ) and the tissue
state coeﬃcient α(t) (Sec. 2.1.2) from Eq. 8. Eq. 9 incorporates the metabolic
heat generation Qm of liver cells (10 714 W
m3 ) [10]. In both equations, ρ the spe-
ciﬁc density of liver tissue (1079 kg
m3 ), cp denotes the liver tissue heat capacity
m ◦C ), T
(3540
the temperature (◦C), wb the liver blood ﬂow rate (16.687 kg
), cb the heat

J
capacity of the blood (3617
In contrast to Linte, in our planning system we model the needle tip or heat
source with complex geometries (e.g. umbrellas), blood vessels as boundary
conditions and breathing motion simulation, use a metabolic heat source Qm
and neglect external cooling Qp (air) ( W
m3 ) from the historical Pennes formula
[31]. The simulation of breathing motion is optionally possible, see Sec. 2.3.
Compared to Pennes [31], this work ignores the external sources spatial heat
up phase qp in ( W
m3 ), because in our situation in the liver there is no constant
external cooling (air) and the blood cooling is already included in the middle
term on the right side of the PDE. Moreover vs. Linte, we use a liver-speciﬁc
Qm [10]. Finally, Linte’s tissue decay term from Eq. 7 contains a singularity
regarding c(0) and yields high values near t = 0.
For 3D continuous space, the partial diﬀerential equation can be written as:

(10)

The ﬁnite-diﬀerence method (FDM) with symmetric partial diﬀerence quo-
tients is used to discretize the partial derivatives on a regular grid of voxels,
i.e. here for x:

∂2Ti
∂x2 ≈

(11)

(cid:77) x denotes the voxel distance between two voxels in the x-direction in mil-
limeter. Neighbours to a voxel with index i are the predecessor i − 1 and
the successor i + 1 in the x-direction. The voxel distances (cid:77) y and (cid:77) z as
well as indices j OliveGreenand k are used accordingly in the equations. Now,
Eq. 10 can be transferred by substitution into 3D voxel image space T n
i,j,k for

n ∈ N0. wbi,j,k , cbi,j,k and Qmi,j,k denote the parameters declared for Eq. 10
voxel-wise.
The Neumann boundary conditions for the blood vessel and needle tip voxels
are ideally assumed as completely isolating, i.e. maintaining a constant tem-
perature (37 ◦C). This is based on the reasonable assumption that any heating
of the blood is immediately carried away by blood ﬂow or constant tip heat
by external energy:

∂2T
∂x2 = 0, for neighbouring voxel outside of liver (towards vessel or tip).

(13)

2.3 Consideration of Breathing Motion

In the 4D simulation of a liver puncture, the movement of the thorax, and
here mainly the diaphragm and upper abdomen, during breathing is taken
into account [8,19]. The simulated temperature images are deformed in the
reference coordinate space X with a diﬀeomorphic motion vector ﬁeld ˆu into
the breathing motion’s curved coordinate space x (Fig. 4):

(cid:0)xt + ˆu−1(xt, t)(cid:1) .

T (xt) = Tref

(14)
The motion vector ﬁelds are computed from consecutive 3D CT phase images
(static breathing states) taken from a breathing cycle scanned over time in a
4D CT data set. Non-linear registrations are calculated between the phases re-
sulting in inter-phase compensation motion vector ﬁelds uphase. In a keyframe
approach, consecutive vector ﬁelds uphase and uphase+1 serve to interpolate
the motion of the cycle as scanned. In a linear regression approach, the vector
ﬁelds (regressand) and a breathing surrogate signal (regressor, e.g. breathing
volume) yield a time variant vector ﬁeld ˆu(xt, t), optionally with surrogate
induced irregular breathing motion [24,25].

2.4 Implementation

The Bioheat equation is a computationally intensive formula. Thus, the Bio-
heat equation is implemented using Nvidia CUDA and runs massively paral-
lelized on a GPU with thousands of computing cores [27].

Robust GPU-based RFA-Simulation

The used subsampled and segmented CT data set (dimensions 2562x234, spac-
ing 1.552 mm2 x2 mm) is converted into a ﬁrst thermal image (t = n = 0) for
Alg. 1. The voxels’ label values of the segmented data set are replaced by the
temperatures of the denoted tissue [10].
Upon this start image (Fig. 5), the heat equation Eq. 12 is calculated and yields
a temperature update value per voxel. In our VR simulator, an image double
buﬀer [32] is used to avoid rendering artifacts from unﬁnished calculations.
Double buﬀering switches back and forth between two buﬀers using memory
pointers, see Alg. 2.

2.5 Evaluation Methods

The temperature propagation simulation proposed here has been compared
with in vitro measurements on real tissue and the simulation by Linte et al.
[13,14]. To compare in a fair manner, the model of this work is calculated on
the same high resolution 0.5 mm3 voxels. The 2.5 mm geometry of the needle
tip is modelled congruent to Linte et al. [13] as a voxel hemisphere by ﬁve
voxels in xy-direction and three voxels in z-direction. Temperatures of 90 ◦C
and 60 ◦C are applied. Simulation time steps of 0.1 s were selected.
Linte et al. [13,14] conducted clinically relevant in vitro experiments. Alas,
they were not reproducible by us to create more data samples, mainly either
because the algorithm was not reproducable or made available from the au-
thors work. The gold-standard for the comparison experiments in Linte’s in
vitro experiments results from repeated measurements using fresh tissue sam-
ples. Symmetrically arranged temperature probes were placed in 2.5 mm and
5 mm distance from the heat source. Four according reference mean curves
result for two distances vs. two ablation temperatures (60 ◦C and 90 ◦C) [14].
Our according in silico simulation measurement points are shown in Fig. 6.
The ”thread per block conﬁguration” performance of the method is measured
in frames per second (FPS). For measurements, a consumer Nvidia GTX 1080
GPU is used with 8 Gb memory and 2560 CUDA cores.

3 Results

First the quantitative results (Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10), then qualitative simulation
examples near a blood vessel and using a complex ablation electrode geometry
are shown (Figs. 11, 12).

3.1 Simulation of Heat Propagation

The experiment with a radius of 5 mm and an ablation heat of 90 ◦C is a key
experiment, where Linte’s method shows signiﬁcant under-planning in terms
of ablation time (vice versa: ablation zone predicted too big). His method is
unsafe and would harm the patient. It is important to note, simulation results

8

Niclas Kath∗ et al.

are absolutely reproducible without standard deviations. The temperatures
measured in vitro (gold standard) and our simulation did not exceed the tis-
sue death threshold of 42.5 ◦C (Fig. 8) after one minute. With smaller errors
the model presented here as well as the in vitro determined temperatures are
below the threshold of 42.5 ◦C. The model of Linte [13] is on average farther
away from the gold standard with a larger range of ﬂuctuation of SD= 0.99 ◦C.
The model from this paper delineates the temperature distribution for dying
cells more accurately, robustly and safer than the comparative model [13] as
no failures (Fig. 10) or overestimations are observed (Figs. 8, 9). Statistically,
this work’s model shows a systematically more similar, stable and theretically
sound temperature curve to the gold standard. Summing up, in the key exper-
iments with 90 ◦C or 60 ◦C and 5 mm radius (Fig. 8), Linte critically or totally
fails. Overall, our model results are similar to the in vitro temperatures, which
reﬂects in signiﬁcantly high (p < 0.005) Pearson correlation coeﬃcients (Fig.
13).

The simulation of the model of this work proves a theoretically sound mono-
tonically converging heating process (Figs. 14a, 14b).

In the qualitative results and without the inﬂuence of a tissue border, the
propagation of the cell death zone converges to a spherical shape ((Fig. 11a)).
If another colder tissue structure inﬂuences the heat zone, its shape adapts
to the boundary of the other tissue due to enhanced cooling (Fig. 11b, c).
Finally, a consideration of the simulation of complex needle geometries such
as umbrella needle shapes (Fig. 12) is interesting for the treatment of larger
tumors (r >5 mm). First the tissue between the individual hot wires heats
up in vitro and then the heat zone converges to a spherical shape. The ﬁrst
supplied movie demonstrates the development of the ablation zone over one
minute1. Second in the context of the 4D-VR simulator with simulated breath-
ing motion according to Eq. 14, a tumor lesion with a yellow fringe is shown
in the top left simulated ﬂuoroscopy view 2. In the movie footage, the yellow
border of the ablation zone corresponds to 42.5 ◦C and red denotes 90 ◦C.

3.2 Rendering-Performance

All kernel conﬁgurations (Tab. 1) achieve over 24 frames per second (FPS) by
far, making it possible to achieve a smooth display needed in moving images
display. All conﬁgurations could be used for real-time simulation of tempera-
ture propagation. The approximately 12% faster runtime of the conﬁguration
with 64 · 3 · 3 threads per block is due to the better use of the shared memory
of CUDA in the calculation of the ﬁnite diﬀerences.

4 Discussion

A highly eﬃcient, accurate and safe planning method for ablation prediction is
proposed in this work. It has been shown that the model of this work achieves
qualitatively plausible and quantitatively robust and safe results with diﬀerent
ablation temperatures and in terms of heat distribution. We take into account
the inﬂuence of tissue boundaries (e.g. blood vessel cooling) and complex nee-
dle tip geometries. Unfortunately, we do neither have access to lab equipment
or more in vitro/in silico data for the ablations nor an implementation of
Linte’s algorithm. Summing up the quantitative evaluation, the model from
this work predicts the temperature distribution for dying cells more accurately,
robustly and reliably than the comparative model [13]. With smaller curvature
errors, the model presented here as well as the in vitro determined tempera-
tures are below the threshold of 42.5 ◦C (Fig. 8) in a key experiment and show
a systematically more similar temperature curve vs. the gold standard and
most importantly vs. theoretical curves. In the studies, the model of this work
shows a conservative underestimation of temperature, but in contrast to the
comparison work it shows no failures, overestimates and irregular ﬂuctuations
around the gold standard while being very near to our elaborated theoretical
characteristics.
The presented model simulated single frames with a far over-fulﬁlling frame
rate (FPS>24 Hz, x23) for our VR planning simulator [7] and in general. In
contrast to Linte et al. [13], the tissue state coeﬃcient and thermal resistance
are not considered, but the metabolic heat generation Qm of the liver is. The
heat zones from this work are consistently closer to reality, i.e. the radius of the
heat zone is more accurate and safe preventing tumor recurrence. The system-
atic underestimation in Fig. 7 means a more conservative planning and is safer
than an overestimation, which is critical to the patient (tumor recurrence). In
only this experiment, the comparison method [13] won, but lost in the other
three challenges for temperature (ablation zone) overestimation (Figs. 8, 9)
or ﬂat-line (Fig. 10). Note again, simulation result diﬀerences are absolutely
reproducible with no standard deviations, i.e. they are highly signiﬁcant per
se - even if the mean gold standard curve is with statistical deviations.
The theoretical monotonically convergence characteristic is hurt in Linte’s
method. In RFA planning, overestimation of the heat zone can be deadly by
leaving residual tumor cells. We attribute this advantage of our method to the
dubious α-term used by Linte depriving blood cooling too early. Additionally,
several questions are not answered in his work: How is the cell concentration
determined at the beginning of the ablation (t = 0), what exactly is the formula
for the function c(t), and how is the singularity avoided. These open issues are
the strongest argument to use our method, which is transparently presented
here. We were not able to get the source code from Linte or re-implement his
method due to the imprecise method descriptions. We were left to compare
against his provided experimental and simulation results. In the light of ab-
solutely reproducible mathematical simulations, our method is a signiﬁcantly
better option. The mean comparison gold standard from Linte’s experiments

10

results from multiple experiments. Our future research is the clariﬁcation what
factors are represented in the experimental (linear) error correction terms to
make our model even better and later come up with a fully theoretical ap-
proach once the remaining error factors are identiﬁed - e.g. we could use a
better tissue decay term with a clear estimator c(t) for healthy cell concentra-
tion. In future research, new in-vitro experiments with signiﬁcant sample size
are planned by us without necessarily comparing to Linte et al.
