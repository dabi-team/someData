ABSTRACT
We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discovered M31 satel-
lites And XV and And XVI, lying at projected distances from the centre of M31 of 93
and 130 kpc respectively. These satellites lie to the South of M31, in regions of the
stellar halo which wide ﬁeld imaging has revealed as relative voids (compared to the
∼degree-scale coherent stream-like structures). Using the DEep Imaging Multi-Object
Spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope, we have deﬁned probable members
of these satellites, for which we derive radial velocities as precise as ∼ 6 km s−1
down to i ∼21.5. While the distance to And XVI remains the same as previously
reported (525±50 kpc), we have demonstrated that the brightest three stars pre-
viously used to deﬁne the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in And XV are in
fact Galactic, and And XV is actually likely to be much more distant at 770±70
kpc (compared to the previous 630 kpc), increasing the luminosity from MV ≈ −9.4
to MV ≈ −9.8. The And XV velocity dispersion is resolved with vr =-339+7
−6 km s−1
and σv = 11+7
−5 km s−1. The And XVI dispersion is not quite resolved at 1σ with
vr =-385+5
km s−1. Using the photometry of the conﬁrmed
member stars, we ﬁnd metallicities of And XV (median [Fe/H]= −1.58, interquar-
tile range ±0.08), and And XVI (median [Fe/H]= −2.23, interquartile range ±0.12).
Stacking the spectra of the member stars, we ﬁnd spectroscopic [Fe/H]= −1.8 (-2.1)
for And XV (And XVI), with a uncertainty of ∼ 0.2 dex in both cases. Our measure-
ments of And XV reasonably resolve its mass (∼ 108 M⊙) and suggest a polar orbit,
while the velocity of And XVI suggests it is approaching the M31 escape velocity given
its large M31-centric distance.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, systematic searches have been performed
in earnest within the Local Group, both photometrically
and spectroscopically, in order to fully catalogue its pop-
ulation of satellite galaxies. There are several motivations
behind these endeavours, with one of the more hotly dis-
cussed being that of the so-called “missing satellites prob-
lem” (Moore et al. 1999; Klypin et al. 1999), which is an
observed discrepancy of 1-2 orders of magnitude between

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS

the number of satellite galaxies produced within cosmo-
logical simulations and the number we see orbiting the
Galaxy and M31 today. And whilst these surveys have
approximately doubled the known satellite populations
of both galaxies within recent years (Zucker et al. 2004;
Willman et al. 2005; Chapman et al. 2005; Belokurov et al.
2006a; Martin 2006; Zucker et al. 2006a,b; Belokurov et al.
2007a; Majewski 2007; Belokurov et al. 2007a; Irwin et al.
2008) we are still far from reconciling the observations with

simulations. Several theories have been put forward in or-
der to address this issue. Survey completeness is a widely
debated topic (see e.g. Tollerud et al. 2008; Simon & Geha
2007), particularly with respect to the MW, where observa-
tional eﬀorts are hampered by obscuration from the disk
and the bulge. Future all-sky surveys may ﬁnd a wealth
of ultra-faint satellites that would allieviate this gap be-
tween observation and theory. Another proposed solution
is that the satellite galaxies within the local group inhabit
increasingly dark matter dominated halos as they become
fainter (Bullock, Kravstov & Weinberg 2000; Stoehr et al.
2002), so that even the faintest of dwarf galaxies would re-
side within massive dark matter halos.

Penarrubia et al. (2006, 2008a, 2008b) demonstrate that
within the LCDM working frame, dwarf spheroidal galaxies
(dSphs) are well embedded within the dark matter halos
that surround them. For the brightest dwarf galaxies in the
MW they ﬁnd that 0.01 < Rc/rs < 0.1, where Rc and rs
are the stellar core radius and the NFW scale radius, respec-
tively. That implies that these systems are fairly resilient to
tidal interactions, so that they can lose a large fraction of
their initial dark matter mass before the stellar component
starts being disrupted.

An observational test of these suggestions is then to
measure the stellar light and dynamical mass of faint dwarf
galaxies in the Local Group. With spectroscopic informa-
tion, one can measure the central velocity dispersion of
the satellite, which has been shown to be a good indica-
tor of the instantaneous mass of a dwarf galaxy within
the radii of the luminous tracers (e.g. Oh, Lin & Aarseth
1995; Piatek & Pryor 1995), even if the dwarf is not in
virial equilibrium or perfectly spherical. Several approaches
have been taken to derive the total mass of the system
from the central velocity dispersion (e.g. Illingworth 1976;
Richstone & Tremaine 1986; Gilmore et al. 2007). Recent
detailed modelling of dwarf galaxy velocity dispersions sug-
gests a lower dynamical mass limit of ∼ 107 M⊙ (Strigari et
al. 2008).

Spectroscopic data on the dSphs of the local group is
also desirable in order to give us a better understanding of
the nature of these tiny galaxies. The discovery and study
of the faintest members of this population has shown that
at the low luminosity end of the spectrum, these satellites
do not behave as expected from the study of their brighter
counterparts. In particular, they begin to deviate signiﬁ-
cantly from established trends between mass and metallicity,
and M/L vs light. In the brighter MW dwarfs, the lack of
very metal poor stars (Helmi et al. 2006), the stellar popu-
lations (Unavane et al. 1996) and diﬀering abundance pat-
terns from the MW halo (Shetrone et al. 2001) reinforce the
point that the surviving, isolated dwarfs have diﬀerent envi-
ronmental conditions than those which phase mixed into the
MW stellar halo. However, the ultra-faint MW satellites do
show evidence of very metal poor stars (Kirby et al. 2008),
possibly suggesting these dwarfs are remnants of the halo
building blocks.

By aquiring kinematic data for the Local Group satel-
lites, we can isolate the likely dwarf member stars from the
Colour Magnitude Diagrams (CMD), perform independent
checks on the metallicities derived photometrically, and also
estimate their total masses so we can place them more fully
in the context of the dSph population, and determine if there

truly is a breakdown in these relations at low luminosities,
and if so, at what point this divergence begins to take eﬀect.
Another motivation behind obtaining kinematic data
for the satellite populations of the MW and M31 is to
achieve a greater understanding of the dynamics of the Lo-
cal Group as a whole. The mass contained within the in-
ner few 10’s kpc of both is relatively well constrained from
optical and HI data, as well as globular cluster and plan-
etary nebulae tracer populations (see e.g. Kochanek 1996;
Carignan et al. 2006), but probing the outer halo at large
radii proves to be more of a challenge. An ideal method for
measuring the total masses of the MW and M31 is to use
their satellite galaxies as direct tracers of their potentials. As
they are located at large distances from their hosts (∼few
100’s kpc) they probe the full extent of their mass distri-
butions. Such a method has been used previously in both
the MW and M31 (Evans et al. 2000; Wilkinson & Evans
1999; Gottesman, Hunter & Boonyasait 2002), however the
associated errors on their measurements are huge (of order
∼twice the measurements themselves) due to the low num-
ber of satellite galaxies with reliable kinematic and distance
data available to them. In the years since these results were
published, more than 20 satellite companions of the MW
and M31 have been discovered, many of which have also
been studied spectroscopically. If kinematic data on all the
satellites within the Local Group can be obtained, we will
be able to better constrain the masses of these two “sister”
galaxies.

With these goals in mind, it remains crucial to obtain
radial velocities for newly discovered dSphs in order to un-
derstand their mass distribution and orbital properties. As
a step towards this end, we have used the Keck II DEep
Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph to derive radial veloci-
ties and metallicities of stars within two new satellites dis-
covered in Ibata et al. (2007), And XV and And XVI.

2 OBSERVATIONS

Multi-object Keck observations with DEIMOS (Faber et al.
2003) for And XV and And XVI were made on 2007 Oct 8–
9, in variable conditions (with 0.6–1.0′′ seeing and patchy
cirrus). To obtain improved S/N in a reasonable exposure
time for the faint (i = 20.5 − 22.5) RGB stars targeted,
we employed the lower resolution 600 line/mm grating. For
the CaII triplet (CaT) lines, which are reasonably resolved
at this lower (R∼3000) resolution, the trade-oﬀ is a strong
function of the location of the spectral features of inter-
est relative to the strong night sky OH recombination lines.
◦
A over the CaT
While we detect continuum at S/N>3 per
regions for faint (i ∼ 22) stars, the velocity errors can suﬀer
larger systematic errors when they lie close to OH lines, and
the velocity accuracy can vary considerably with continuum
S/N. Our chosen instrumental setting covered the observed
wavelength range from 0.56 − 0.98µm. Exposure time was
60 min on each dSph, split into 20-min integrations. Data
reduction followed standard techniques using the DEIMOS-
DEEP2 pipeline (Faber et al. 2003), debiassing, ﬂat-ﬁelding,
extracting, wavelength-calibrating and sky-subtracting the
spectra.

The radial velocities of the stars were then measured by

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

ﬁtting the peak of the cross-correlation function derived us-
ing a template spectrum consisting of delta functions to the
◦
A) at the wavelengths of the CaT
instrumental resolution (3
absorption lines. This procedure also provides an estimate
of the radial velocity accuracy obtained for each measure-
ment. The velocity uncertainties typically range from 6 to
25 km s−1. Target stars were assigned from a broad (1 mag)
box around the general outline of the RGB of the dwarf.
A narrower box of 0.3 mag around the RGB was then con-
structed with higher priorities. In both of these selection
boxes, the priority was scaled as a function of i-mag so that
brighter stars had more chances of being observed. The re-
mainder of the mask space was ﬁlled with target stars from
a broad region encompassing RGB stars in M31 over all
possible metallicities and distances. The And XV, And XVI
masks had 143, 131 target stars respectively. The small num-
ber of candidate members compared to the total amount of
stars observed is simply due to the fact that the footprint of
DEIMOS is much wider than the small angular size of the
dwarf galaxies, therefore, there are many more stars that are
not part of the main dSph targets.

3 RESULTS

The spatial distributions of the stars in the regions of
And XV, And XVI are shown in Figure 1. Candidate mem-
ber stars from the DEIMOS spectroscopy are highlighted
(listed in Tables 1 & 2). Member stars are selected by hav-
ing a velocity which lies within 2σ of the median of the
obvious kinematic clumps of stars in each dwarf ﬁeld. Note
that for And XV, the member stars are highlighted diﬀer-
ently for robust and tentative members, deﬁned below in
terms of the strength of the cross-correlation peak in the
velocity determination. CFHT-MegaCam colour-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) of stars within a three arcminute radius
of And XV and And XVI are shown in Figure 2, again with
likely member stars highlighted. The red giant branches of
both dwarfs are clearly visible, while the horizontal branches
are reasonably detected. In the case of And XV, three stars
previously assumed to lie near the TRGB have been shown
by their velocities and NaI doublet equivalent width (EW)
to be foreground Galactic dwarf stars. We then revise the
distance estimate of And XV from the 630±60 kpc previ-
ously reported (Ibata et al. 2007), estimating the true tip of
the RGB is ∼0.5 mag fainter than the i = 20.4 previously
assumed. Adopting MTRGB = -4.04 ± 0.12 from Bellazzini,
Ferraro & Pancino (2001) for the absolute I-band magnitude
of the RGB tip, and convert into the Landolt system using
the colour equations in Ibata et al. (2007) and those given by
McConnachie et al. (2004); this yields a distance modulus
of m − M = 24.4 ± 0.2 or a distance of 770±70 kpc (ver-
sus the previous 630±60 kpc). This revised distance agrees
with that obtained by considering the magnitude, g ∼ 25.3,
of the Horizontal Branch (Fig. 2). The change in distance
increases the luminosity from MV ≈ −9.4 to MV ≈ −9.8. In
And XVI, as all stars near the TRGB were conﬁrmed spec-
troscopically as members of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy, the
Ibata et al. (2007) distance estimate of 525 ± 50 kpc remains
unchanged. The horizontal branch for And XVI (Fig. 2) at
g ∼ 24.5 (0.8 mag diﬀerence from And XVI) agrees well with
our proposed 0.5 mag diﬀerence in the TRGB between the

two dwarf spheroidals. In Fig. 2, we also overlay 13 Gyr old
Padova isochrones with solar-scaled chemical compositions
(Girardi et al. 2004), at the TRGB distance and median
metallicity obtained from member stars (see below), provid-
ing a reasonable ﬁt in both cases. The use of an old (13 Gyr)
isochrone can be justiﬁed by the predominantly old nature
of the majority of the recently detected M31 satellites.

The distribution of stars in And XV and And XVI is
shown in Fig. 3 as a function of their radial velocity. The
stars are then shown as a function of radius from the cen-
ters of the dwarfs with half-light radii indicated. Photomet-
ric [Fe/H] is estimated by comparison to Padova isochrones
(Girardi et al. 2004) corrected for extinction (Schlegel et al.
1998) and shifted to the revised distances of the dSphs.
These [Fe/H] values are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of
their radial velocity, revealing the tight range in metallicities
of both And XV (median [Fe/H]=-1.58, interquartile range
±0.08), And XVI (median [Fe/H]=-2.23, interquartile range
±0.12). For And XV the median [Fe/H] and its dispersion
are identical using either the robust spectra or including the
tentative spectra as well, lending further evidence to these
stars likely being And XV members.

One-dimensional spectra of member stars in And XV
and And XVI are shown in Figs. 4 & 5 respectively. And XV
spectra are separated into robust members with cross-
correlation peak > 0.2, and more tentative member stars
with cross-correlation peak < 0.2, but still lying on the
well deﬁned RGB of And XV. The inverse variance weighted,
summed spectrum is shown in the bottom oﬀset panel for
each dSph. All candidate member spectra for And XVI are
considered to be robust by the above criteria. While not
shown in the spectra, the NaI doublet is undetected sig-
niﬁcantly in the individual stars, and also in the stacked
spectra. The NaI equivalent width is sensitive to the surface
gravity, and thus is a good discriminant of Galactic fore-
ground dwarf stars (Schiavon et al. 1997), although at these
large negative velocities, the probability is very low that any
identiﬁed star in our CMD selection box would be Galactic.
Stars with velocities < 150 km s−1, consistent with Galactic
stars typically have well detected NaI doublet lines in our
DEIMOS spectra. The spectroscopic [Fe/H] has very large
errors in most of the individual spectra, however a reason-
able comparison can be made between the [Fe/H] derived
from the stacked spectrum and the median photometric
[Fe/H]. We ﬁnd [Fe/H]= −1.8 (-2.1) for And XV (And XVI)
by measuring the EW of the CaII triplet lines as in Chap-
man et al. (2005), on the Carretta & Gratton (1997) scale.
A large uncertainty, measured from the summed sky spec-
trum, of ∼ 0.2 dex is due primarily to sky-subtraction resid-
uals making it diﬃcult to deﬁne the continuum level of the
spectrum. Koch et al. (2008) have also demonstrated that
high quality Keck/DEIMOS spectra of stars in the M31 halo
are amenable to further chemical analysis, showing a range
of species (mostly FeI and TiI lines) which become weaker
for the more metal-poor stars. For And XV and And XVI,
even the stacked spectra do not detect signiﬁcant absorp-
◦
tion at the TiI lines (8378, 8426, and 8435
A). Our stacked
spectra do not have the requisite S/N to detect the antici-
pated EW based on stars of similar metallicity from Koch
et al. (2008), although roughly tripling the S/N of the spec-
tra would be more than suﬃcient (∼ 4× integration time

in typical Mauna Kea weather conditions, compared to the
rather poor conditions under which the present data were
taken).

For our samples of member stars with large and vari-
able velocity errors (typically 6–25 km s−1), the Maximum
Likelihood approach (e.g., Martin et al. 2007) provides a
method to assess the true underlying velocity distribution
of the dSphs. Figure 6 shows the results of our analysis of
And XV and And XVI plotting the one dimensional distri-
butions 1, 2, 3×σ values. The And XV dispersion is resolved
with vr =-339+7
km s−1, where little

diﬀerence is found from using only the best seven member
stars (from Fig. 4) versus using all 13 candidate members
(including the six more tentative velocities measurements).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have been able to further constrain the properties of the
dSphs And XV, And XVI by measuring velocities and metal-
licities and assigning probable member stars to each galaxy.
While this represents a signiﬁcant addition to our knowledge
about these dSphs compared to the photometric discovery
and characterization (Ibata et al. 2007), our spectroscopic
measurements are generally not precise enough to provide
robust measures of the velocity dispersions. And XV has a
most likely dispersion ∼ 10 km s−1 (while And XVI is more
poorly constrained but has a 1σ upper limit of 10 km s−1)
which would translate to a ∼ 108 M⊙ halo mass using the
method of Richstone & Tremaine (1986) as has been done
for other M31 dSphs with better constrained velocity dis-
persions (e.g., Chapman et al. 2005, Majewski et al. 2007).
This is similar to that proposed by Gilmore et al. (2007)
for a limiting dark matter halo mass in the smallest galax-
ies, however we cannot conﬁdently rule out that the disper-
sions are smaller than our measurements suggest. Longer
Keck/DEIMOS exposures under good conditions could sig-
niﬁcantly improve these results. The relatively well popu-
lated RGBs of both dSphs suggests that enough member
stars could be obtained to begin to measure the velocity
dispersion proﬁle, a much more reliable constraint on the
dark matter halo mass (Gilmore et al. 2007).

As mentioned, both dSphs lie in relative voids (free of
degree-scale substructure) in the M31 halo maps of Ibata
et al. (2007). In our spectroscopic samples there are rela-
tively few remaining M31 halo stars once the likely And XV,
And XVI member stars and Galactic foreground are removed
(3 and 6 candidate halo stars respectively, and some of
these are likely to be Galactic by their proximity to the
low-velocity regime of Milky Way stars). This is consistent
with the extrapolated M31 halo proﬂe (Ibata et al. 2007)
out to 93 kpc and 130 kpc respectively. However, this sug-
gests that signiﬁcant spectroscopic eﬀorts would be required
to properly characterize the (substructure-free) halo in the
100-150 kpc regime. Nonetheless, the average spectroscopic
[Fe/H]=-1.5 of these 9 conﬁrmed M31 halo stars is consistent
with a lack of metallicity grandient in the underlying metal
poor ([Fe/H]=-1.4) halo found within the inner 70 kpc of
M31 (Chapman et al. 2006). Spectroscopic studies of RGB
stars along the minor axis of M31 have been prone to inad-

vertently sampling stream-like substructure (Gilbert et al.
2006; Koch et al. 2008; Chapman et al. 2008), but they also
do ﬁnd a range of metallicities in the 100-150 kpc regime
consistent with the [Fe/H] in these dSph ﬁelds.

We have described before in Chapman et al. (2008) the
expected probabilities of halo star contamination to ﬁelds
at these distances. Here we run a simple Monte Carlo simu-
lation of the expected eﬀect of the contaminant on the ob-
served σv. We take two distributions, for the halo (120km/s
σv at 100kpc projected) and for each dSph as measured
here. We then draw randomly from these distributions, ask-
ing how often halo stars land in some window indistin-
guishable from the dSph. We then remeasure the dwarf σv
whenever star(s) from the halo are present. We ﬁnd a halo
star lands in the And XV window 25% of the time, and in
And XVI 9% of the time. In 100 samples with a contami-
nating halo star(s) lying in the dSph, the velocity disper-
sion was measured to range 11-12 km/s (And XV, assumed
σv=11km/s) and 8-9 km/s (And XVI, assumed σv=8 km/s).
Thus the aﬀect of halo stars lying in the velocity window is
small relative to the errors in estimating σv.

We then turn to the orbital properties of these dSphs.
And XV lies near the minor axis of M31, at about the same
distance and heliocentric velocity as M31 (785 kpc and vr ∼-
300 km s−1). As such, its orbit must be close to polar with
a large implied tangential velocity component. By contrast,
at the large M31-centric distance of And XVI (∼270 kpc),
its velocity of ∼ −400 km s−1 pushes it towards the escape
velocity of M31 (assuming the mass modeling of Geehan et
al. 2006; see Chapman et al. 2007 Fig. 4 for a depiction of
the M31 dwarf galaxies in this context). This is compara-
ble to the orbital properties other recently discovered dSphs
(And XII: Chapman et al. 2007; And XIV: Majewski et al.
2007). In particular, And XII is traveling near the escape ve-
locity of the entire Local Group. Finding so many satellites
near the escape velocity of M31 may suggest that the total
mass of M31 has been somewhat underestimated to date.

And XVI appears to sit spatially within a preferred dis-
tribution of satellites of M31 (Koch et al. 2006; McConnachie
& Irwin 2006), falling towards us at ∼ 100 km s−1 (with
an unknown tangential component). However, And XV sits
somewhat outside of this distribution (in both position and
likely orbit) and may represent one of the growing number of
discovered M31 satellites which hint at a more complicated
environment than was apparent with the ﬁrst generation of
discovered satellites.

Figure 3. Distribution of stars in And XV (top), And XVI (bot-
tom) as a function of their radial velocity (upper panels). The
stars are then shown as a function of radius from the centers of
the dSphs, with half-light radius drawn as a dashed line (mid-
dle panels). Photometric [Fe/H] as described in the text is shown
on the bottom panels, revealing the tight range in metallicities
of And XV ([Fe/H]∼-1.6), And XVI ([Fe/H]∼-2.2). Symbols are
highlighted as in Figs 1&2.

Figure 2. CFHT-MegaCam colour-magnitude diagrams of stars
within a three arcminute radius of And XV (top) and And XVI
(bottom). The MegaCam mags are calibrated on SDSS-like sys-
tem as AB mags. The red giant branches of both dSphs are clearly
visible, while the horizontal branch is reasonably detected in both
cases. Candidate member stars from the DEIMOS spectroscopy
are highlighted (ﬁlled squares – robust members, ﬁlled triangles
– tentative members). In the case of And XV, three stars previ-
ously assumed to lie near the TRGB have been shown by their
velocities and NaI doublet EWs to be Galactic foreground (open
pentagons). The revised TRGB and horizontal branch distance
to And XV is 770 kpc as described in the text. 13 Gyr old Padova
isochrones are overlaid, at the TRGB distance and median metal-
licity obtained from member stars, providing a reasonable ﬁt in
both cases.

inverse variance weighted summed spectrum is shown in the bot-
tom oﬀset panel.

Figure 4. Spectra of candidate member stars in And XV. Top
panel shows robust members with cross correlation peak > 0.2.
Bottom panel shows more tentative member stars with cross cor-
relation peak < 0.2, but still lying on the well deﬁned RGB
of And XV. The inverse variance weighted summed spectrum is
shown in the bottom oﬀset panels for each subsample.

Figure 6. Likelihood distributions of member stars in And XV
(top) and And XVI (bottom). The point shows the most likely val-
ues of radial velocity and velocity dispersion, dashed lines showing
the 1, 2, 3×σ distributions. For And XV, we show likelihood distri-
butions of the seven best candidate members. The And XV disper-
sion is resolved with vr =-339+7
