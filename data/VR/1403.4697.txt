ABSTRACT
We have examined the relationship between the velocity parameters of SiO masers
and the phase of the long period variable stars (LPVs) from which the masers orig-
inate. The SiO spectra from the v=1, J=1-0 (43.122 GHz; hereafter J1→0) and the
v=1, J=2-1 (86.2434 GHz; hereafter J2→1) transitions have been measured using the
Mopra Telescope of the Australia Telescope National Facility. One hundred twenty
one sources have been observed including 47 LPVs contained in the American As-
sociation of Variable Star Observer Bulletin (2011). The epoch of maxima and the
periods of the LPVs are well studied. This database of spectra allows for phase de-
pendent comparisons and analysis not previously possible with such a large number
of sources observed almost simultaneously in the two transitions over a time span of
several years. The velocity centroids (V Cs) and velocity ranges of emission (V Rs)
have been determined and compared for the two transitions as a function of phase.
No obvious phase dependence has been determined for the V C or V R. The results of
this analysis are compared with past observations and existing SiO maser theory.

Key words: Physical Data and Processes – Masers. Stars – Variables

1 BACKGROUND

1.1 V Cs and V Rs

The determination of the V C and V R were recently pre-
sented (McIntosh & Indermuehle 2013a) and will only be
brieﬂy reviewed here. Mathematically, the V C is the sum of
the antenna temperature Ta in each velocity channel times
the velocity with respect to the local standard of rest vlsr of
the velocity channel over the range of emission divided by
the sum of the Ta in each velocity channel over the range of
emission as shown in equation 1.

V C =

P (Tavlsr)
P Ta

(1)

The summation extends over the range of emission.
The V R is calculated to be the region where the Ta
exceeds three times the standard deviation of the antenna
temperature of the background noise. The standard devia-
tion is determined from velocity channels far away from the
emission range of the source.

McIntosh & Indermuehle (2013a) examined the V Cs
and V Rs of the SiO maser transitions without regard to the

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS

phase of the star. In this work we found that the V R1→0 was
generally broader than the V R2→1, 6.4kms−1 to 4.2kms−1,
respectively. The V C1→0 are slightly more positive than the
V C2→1. These diﬀerences indicate that the J1→0 occurs in
a dynamically diﬀerent region of the circumstellar environ-
ment than the J2→1. This conclusion is consistent with the
observational results of Soria-Ruiz et al. (2007, 2004). The
V C is a well suited parameter to compare our single dish
observations to VLBI observations, as it is weighted to the
brightest emission. This eﬀect is apparent in the ﬁgures B1-
B3 in Assaf K. A. et al. (2011). Kim J. et al. (2014) have
compared SiO and H2O maser emission from a 401 evolved
stars. They ﬁnd that SiO emission is less dependent on the
optical phase than the H2O masers. While this is a relative
conclusion only, it indicates no strong phase relationship for
the V R, a ﬁnding which complements our own.

Phillips et al. (2003) concluded that J1→0 and J2→1
emission can form at comparable radii and in related
columns of gas although their VLBI maps show few over-
laps between the two transitions. Recent theoretical devel-
opments vary in predicting the radii at which the J1→0
and J2→1 emission occur. Gray et al. (2009) have the J2→1
emission at larger or smaller radii than the J1→0 emission
depending on the phase. Yun & Park (2013) show no dis-

cernible diﬀerence in the radii at which the maser originate
at any phase presented.

1.2 Phase Determination

The phase of the star is the optical phase. It is determined by
subtracting the Julian Day Number of the most recent stellar
maximum from the Julian Day Number of the observation
and dividing by the stellar period. The phase varies from
zero to one. The stellar maxima and periods were obtained
from the AAVSO Bulletin 74 (AAVSO 2011). Stellar periods
were added or subtracted from the Bulletin 74 maxima as
needed to determine the most recent maxima. 1 gives the
stellar periods used for the sources.

1.3 Maser Velocity Parameters

Gray et al. (2009) investigated the dynamics of the cir-
cumstellar region in which the SiO masers originate and
have provided the most thoroughly developed theory for the
maser spectra in LPVs from phase 0.1 to 0.4. They model
and depict a shock traveling out from the star generating dif-
ferent velocities, red shifted or more positive and blue shifted
or more negative, at diﬀerent distances from the star. As the
shock travels out the velocities change as a function of dis-
tance from the star and phase. Gray et al. (2009) predicted a
phase dependent V R1→0 varying from about 8 to 13kms−1.
The V R2→1 varies from about 7 to 12kms−1. The diﬀerence
between the V Rs in the two transitions is phase dependent
and diﬃcult to quantify from the information presented, but
the V R1→0 always appears to be greater than the V R2→1.
In their Figure 12 they show that at a phase of 0.4 only the
J1→0 emission should be present, at a phase of 0.3 the maxi-
mum V R should occur in the J1→0 emission, several kms−1
broader than the emission at phase of 0.1, and the V C1→0
should undergo a redward shift with increasing phase. No
shift in the peak or V C is indicated for the J2→1 transition.
Yun & Park (2013) have developed a coupled escape
probability model for SiO maser emission. They present sev-
eral ﬁgures indicating the V R in the J1→0 and J2→1 tran-
sitions. In their Figure 7, the J2→1 emission is consistently
broader than the J1→0 emission, and the V R1→0 and V R2→1
vary by a factor of more than ﬁve over the stellar period.
The emission at their epoch 6 is several times broader than
the emission at the other epochs depicted. For their Epoch
11 the J1→0 is very weak and narrow. Since diﬀerent dis-
tances from the star are aﬀected diﬀerently by the proposed
shock travelling out from the star, it is reasonable to expect
that masers forming at diﬀerent distances from the star will
exhibit diﬀerent V Rs and slightly diﬀerent V Cs. The obser-
vations of the velocity parameters of the emission provide
information on the locations as well as the motion of the
masing material.

2 OBSERVATIONS

The 22 m Mopra radio telescope is located in New South
Wales, Australia. At Mopra each maser source is ﬁrst
pointed on to ascertain adequate positioning inside the
beam. The observations are then executed as 16 cycles

on and 16 cycles oﬀ observation, thus lasting 64 sec-
onds per on/oﬀ pair. For J2→1 observations the rms noise
was about 1.8 Jy. For J1→0 observations the rms noise
was about 0.6 Jy. The velocity resolution was 0.23kms−1
(J1→0) and 0.12kms−1 (J2→1). The Mopra monitoring pro-
gramme observes 121 sources since 2008 and is described in
the data catalogue by Indermuehle B. et al. (2013). LPVs,
semi-regular variables, irregular variables, OH-IR stars, and
the Orion SiO maser source were observed approximately
monthly in J1→0 and J2→1 between 2008 and 2012. LPVs
were chosen for this analysis because they present a rela-
tively uniform collection of sources and a group of stars for
which theoretical models of the SiO maser emission have
been developed. For the 47 LPVs observed, the stellar ve-
locity, the number of observations in each transition, and
the number of observations of both transitions within 24
hours are given in Table 1. The sources are listed in the
AAVSO Bulletin (AAVSO 2011) as LPVs with well deter-
mined maxima and periods. Non detections of the sources
have not been included in the following analysis.

3 VELOCITY PARAMETERS AND RESULTS

3.1 V C Comparison

Since observations indicate and theories predict that the
J1→0 and J2→1 masers exist at diﬀerent distances from the
star a phase dependent diﬀerence in the V C2→1 and V C1→0
might exist as the proposed shock propagates outward from
the star. Figure 1 shows the V C2→1 V C1→0 versus phase.
No phase dependence of the V C diﬀerence is obvious. There
are also predictions that the V C should have a redward
shift in the V C1→0 versus phase (Gray et al. 2009). Fig-
ure 2 shows the V C1→0 at the phase indicated minus the
V C1→0 at the earliest observed phase during a stellar cycle
(normalized to the earliest observed phase). At least ﬁve ob-
servations of the source during an individual phase period
had to be available to include the information in this anal-
ysis. This requirement insured that only data representing
observations spread over the phase period were analyzed.
Again there is no obvious systematic redward or blueward
shift . Figure 3 presents the same information for the J2→1.
For this transition the blueward spread is larger than the
redward spread, but again no deﬁnitive trend is obvious.

Cho, Kaifu, & Ukita (1996) subtracted the stellar ve-
locity from the “mean velocity” of the J1→0 and the SiO
v=2, J=1-0 emission from 43 late type stars. They con-
cluded, based on the data shown in their Figure 5, “The
mean velocity of the 28 SiO v=1 and v=2 masers as a func-
tion of the optical phase shows that the redshifted emission
is dominating during the phases from 0.3 to 0.8, while the
blueshifted emission appears from phase ≈ 0.85 and is dom-
inating during phases 0.0-0.2 (or 1.0-1.2).” Figure 4 shows
the results of a similar analysis with our data subtracting the
stellar velocity from the velocity centroid. We have approxi-
mately 10 times as many data points as Cho, Kaifu, & Ukita
(1996). No phase dependent shift of the V Cs with respect
to the stellar velocity is obvious.

3.2 V R Comparison

Many observers have concluded that the SiO maser in-
tegrated ﬂux density is a maximum at a stellar phase
of between 0.05 and 0.2 (Hjalmarson & Olofsson 1979;
Pardo et al. 2004). Alcolea et al. (1999) stated that there
was a variable contrast of the integrated ﬂux density over
the period of the stars. The contrast was deﬁned as the “in-
tensity ratio between consecutive maximum and minimum
epochs.” The average contrast was approximately three but
ranged from four to 20 for Mira. These conclusions have
generally been based on observations of the brightest maser
sources and all the sources were not LPVs. While the in-
tegrated ﬂux density versus phase has been well examined,
the V R has not been previously examined as a function
of stellar phase. Figures 5 and 6 show the velocity ranges
of the J1→0 and J2→1 transitions respectively. The veloc-
ity range of emission does not reproduce the phase depen-
dence of the integrated intensity. There is no obvious max-

c(cid:13) 2013 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–4

imum or minimum in the V R of either transition versus
phase. The V R1→0 generally exceeds the V R2→1 as stated in
McIntosh & Indermuehle (2013a). Figure 8 in Kim J. et al.
(2014) shows the full width at zero power versus optical
phase for SiO masers, which is a similar metric as we are
employing and showing in our Figure 5. It is interesting to
see that they do not ﬁnd a strong correlation either between
optical phase and peak emission from SiO masers in their
large sample of 401 late type stars.

4 FUTURE WORK

In the future the Mopra SiO maser database will be used
to look for periodicities in velocity parameters of individual
sources. L2 Puppis, a semi-regular variable, has been exam-
ined and a 139 day periodicity in the SiO V C has been found
(McIntosh & Indermuehle 2013b). This periodicity likely in-
dicates a non-radial pulsation of the star. Periodicities in

asymmetries in the circumstellar environment. The case of
L2 Puppis is similar to that of ﬁndings by a VLBI study
of TX Cam (a source too far north to be in the Mopra
catalogue) in which periodicity in SiO emission has been
observed by Gonidakis I. et al. (2013).

5 CONCLUSIONS

The Mopra database provides the ﬁrst large data set of LPV
SiO maser spectra (essentially simultaneous observations in
J2→1 and J1→0 from 2008 until 2012) to allow the compari-
son of the V Cs and V Rs versus phase with theoretical model
predictions. The velocity comparisons extracted from these
observations will inform and constrain the development of
future models of the circumstellar environment and maser
dynamics. The analysis of the V Cs and V Rs of 47 LPVs as a
