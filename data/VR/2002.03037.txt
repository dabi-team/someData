ABSTRACT
Virtual Reality enables the exploration of large information spaces.
In physically constrained spaces such as airplanes or buses,
controller-based or mid-air interaction in mobile Virtual Reality
can be challenging. Instead, the input space on and above touch-
screen enabled devices such as smartphones or tablets could be
employed for Virtual Reality interaction in those spaces.

In this context, we compared an above surface interaction tech-
nique with traditional 2D on-surface input for navigating large planar
information spaces such as maps in a controlled user study (n = 20).
We ﬁnd that our proposed above surface interaction technique results
in signiﬁcantly better performance and user preference compared to
pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-pan when navigating planar information
spaces.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent progress in Virtual Reality (VR) technology has enabled the
possibility of allowing users to conduct knowledge work in mobile
scenarios. While the vision of a spatial user interface supporting
knowledge work has been investigated for many years (e.g. [84, 85]),
the recent emergence of consumer-oriented VR headsets now make
it feasible to explore the design of portable user interface solutions
[35].

Lately, commercial VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) are pro-
gressing to ’inside-out’ tracking using multiple built-in cameras.
Inside-out tracking allows a simple setup of the VR system, and

the ability to work in un-instrumented environments. Further, 3D
ﬁnger tracking might be supported by traditional computing de-
vices such as smartphones [114], which at the same time provide
complementary high accuracy 2D touch input.

Given the capability of spatial hand and ﬁnger sensing, it is pos-
sible to see VR extending the input space of existing computing
devices such as touch screens to a space around the devices, enhanc-
ing their usage. For example, knowledge workers can utilize existing
2D surface tools, new 3D tools, as well as using space around the de-
vices and in front of the screen, reachable while sitting, to represent
and manipulate additional information.

However, while VR is promising for mobile work it also brings
its own additional challenges. For example, mobile information
workers might many times be conﬁned to a small space, such as
the case of traveling in an airplane or a bus. While they can view
potentially very large information spaces through their HMD, the
ability to interact with those spaces might be limited in constrained
physical spaces, restricting the suitability of ample spatial gestures
[35]. Hence, we see it as important to examine interactions in
potentially small input spaces. Also, while VR lends itself for
interaction with three dimensional data, many knowledge worker
tasks are still bound to two dimensional information surfaces [35].
In this context, this paper explores how to efﬁciently navigate
multiscale information spaces in a small input space using a combi-
nation of VR HMD and a touch surface. Speciﬁcally, we explore the
navigation of 2D planar information spaces such as maps using small
spatial ﬁnger movements above a touchscreen while simultaneously
allowing users to view beyond the boundaries of the touchscreen
using a VR HMD.

Our contribution lies in the design and evaluation of such as spa-
tial interaction technique for navigation of large planar information
spaces. In a user study (n = 20) we show that the proposed technique
outperforms traditional 2D surface gestures.

2 RELATED WORK

Our work builds on the areas of spatial and around device interaction
as well as multiscale navigation, which will be reviewed next.

 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1 Spatial Interaction

In the context of spatial user interfaces, a large number of techniques
for selection, spatial manipulation, navigation and system control
have been proposed [58]. Regarding object selection, Argelaguet et
al. [4] presented a survey on 3D selection techniques. For a recent
survey on 3D virtual object manipulation we refer to Mendes et
al. [67]. Also, for spatial interaction across mobile devices (mostly
in non-VR settings) recent surveys are available [18, 33].

For VR, spatial pointing techniques are of special interest, often
relying on virtual hand or raycasting techniques. In the context
of raycasting, Mayer et al. [66] investigated the effects of offset
correction and cursor on mid-air pointing and Schwind et al. [94]
showed that avatar representations can have an effect on ray-casting-
based pointing accuracy. For virtual hand-based pointing, Barrera
et al. [9] indicated effects of stereo display deﬁciencies. Chan et
al. [21] explored the use of visual and auditory feedback for facili-
tating spatial selection. Teather et al. [109] also investigated visual
aids for 3D selection in VR. Lubos et al. [64] and Yu et al. [119]
investigated 3D selection in VR headsets, where Lubos found that
visual perception has a larger effect on target acquisition than motor
actions. Stuerzlinger and Teather proposed guidelines for targets
in 3D pointing experiments [106]. The performance of 2D touch
and mid-air selection on stereoscopic tabletop displays has been
explored by Bruder et al. [16, 17]. Further, a number of techniques
have been proposed for 3D object selection in the presence of object
occlusion (e.g., [3, 11, 28, 102, 104]).

Besides, unimodal techniques, the combination of touch with
mid-air, has drawn attention from researchers. For example, out-
side of VR, M¨uller et al. [70] investigated the use of touch and
mid-air interaction on public displays, Hilliges et al. [44] studied
tabletop settings. Multiple works have proposed to utilize handheld
touchscreens in spatial user interfaces for tasks such as sketching,
ideation and modelling (e.g., [5, 26, 31, 46, 83]), navigation of vol-
umetric data [98], 3D data exploration [63] or system control [13].
Spatial manipulation has seen particular interest in single-user set-
tings (e.g., [8, 48, 61, 65, 69, 107, 108]) but also in collaborative
settings [32].

Evolving from the magic lens [12] and tangible interaction con-
cepts [112] tangible magic lenses allow to access and manipulate
otherwise hidden data in interactive spatial environments. A wide va-
riety of interaction concepts have been proposed within the scope of
information visualization (for surveys we refer to [110, 111]). Both
rigid shapes (e.g., rectangular [99]) or circular [101] and ﬂexible
shapes (e.g., [103]) have been utilized as well as various display me-
dia (e.g., projection on cardboard [20,99]), transparent props [15,88],
handheld touchscreens [36, 60], or virtual lenses [62] and sizes [73].
Also, the combination of touch and gaze has seen recent interest for
interaction in spatial user interfaces (e.g., [45, 55, 79, 86, 93]).

Recently, Satriadi et al. and Austin et al. [6, 87] investigated hand
and foot gestures for map navigation within Augmented Reality
in tabletop settings. Our work relates in the use of above surface
interaction, but focuses on the interaction in constrained spatial
environments.

Within this work, we concentrate on the use of mid-air inter-
action in conjunction with touch screen interaction for navigating
potentially large planar information spaces such as maps.

2.2 Around Device Interaction

Along with the reduction of the size and weight of mobile and
wearable devices, the need for complementary interaction meth-
ods evolved. Research began investigating options for interaction
next to [72], above [30, 53], behind [25, 115], across [22, 89], or
around [116, 123] the device. The additional modalities are either
substituting or complementing the devices’ capabilities.

Different sensing solutions have been proposed such as infrared
sensors (e.g., [19]), cameras (e.g., [7,118], acoustic sensing (e.g., [40,

41, 71], piezo sensors (e.g., [116]), depth sensors (e.g., [23, 54, 95],
electric ﬁeld sensing ( [124]), or radar-based sensing (e.g., [114].
Several approaches also investigated how to enable around-device
interaction on unmodiﬁed devices (e.g., [34, 90, 96, 97]).

In VR, around device interaction has been studied in conjunction

with physical keyboards for text entry (e.g., [68, 74, 75, 91]).

This prior work, alongside commercialization efforts (e.g., for
radar-based sensing [114], which recently made its way into com-
mercial products such as Google Motion Sense1) motivate us, that
around-device interaction on mobile devices has the chance to be-
come widely available for consumers.

2.3 Multiscale Navigation

To deal with large information spaces, multiscale interfaces [10, 39,
78] introduce the scale dimension, sometimes called Z2. Cockburn et
al. [24] give a comprehensive overview of overview+detail, zooming
and focus+context interfaces including techniques for multiscale
navigation. Many techniques make use of a separate zoom/scale
dimension and a scroll/pan dimension to select a target value in
the multiscale space [37]. Prior work indicated, that multiscale
navigation with 2D interfaces obeys Fitt’s law [38, 39]. Perluson et
al. [77] investigated bimanual techniques for multiscale navigation.
Appert et al. [2] investigated 1D multiscale navigation with a mouse-
based zooming technique.

In VR, multiscale collaborative virtual environments have been
studied (e.g., [29, 56, 59, 80, 81, 121]) and various metaphors (such
as world-in-miniature) have been investigated for navigation tasks
(e.g. [1, 51, 117]). Further, Zhang et al. [57, 105, 120] introduced a
progressive mental model supporting multiscale navigation and also
indicated that navigation in multiscale virtual environments can be
challenging [122].

For mobile devices, Jones et al. [47] investigated mid-air inter-
actions for multiscale navigation afforded by mobile depth sensors
and discussed design implication for mid-air interactions and depth-
sensor design. Kister et al. [50] combined spatially-aware mobile
displays and large wall displays for graph explorations. Kratz et
al. [52] proposed a semi-automatic zooming technique as an alter-
native to multi-touch zooming but could not indicate signiﬁcant
performance beneﬁts. For mouse-based interaction in desktop en-
vironments, Igarashi and Hinckley proposed rate-based scrolling
with automatic zooming to obtain a constant perceived scrolling
speed in screen space. To this end, when the user scrolled fast, the
view autonatically zoomed out. The authors indicated a comparable
performance to the use of scroll bars.

Spindler et al. [100] compared pinch to zoom and drag to pan with
mid-air spatial navigation utilizing absolute mappings and found that
navigating a large information space by moving the display devices
outperforms navigation with 2D surface gestures. Pahud et al. [76]
compared 2d surface gestures with spatial navigation but derived at
different ﬁndings (spatial navigation was slower than 2D navigation).
Related, Hasan et al. [43] compared dynamic peephole pointing and
direct off-screen pointing with on-screen 2D gestures for map based
analytic tasks. They found that while the spatially aware techniques
resulted in up to 30% faster navigation times, 2D onscreen gestures
allowed for more accurate retrieval of work space content.

Our study also compares to a 2D surface gesture baseline tech-
nique, but compare it to relative-rate controlled above surface in-
teraction technique, which is suitable for a wide variety of usage
scenarios, including interaction in physically constrained environ-
ments such as trains or touchdown places.

3 ABOVE SURFACE INTERACTION FOR MULTISCALE NAVI-

GATION IN MOBILE VR

Within this research, we set out to support efﬁcient navigation of
large information spaces using a potential small interaction space
(such as the space on and above a smartphone or a tablet) using
a combination of spatial interaction and a touch surface. In this
joint interaction space between touchscreens and VR headsets, the
touchscreen can be utilized for ﬁne grained 2D touch interactions,
while the VR headsets allows to visualize content beyond the device
boundary of the touchscreen. Within this scenario, spatial tracking
of users’ hands and ﬁngers could be achieved either by camera-based
inside-out tracking on the VR headset (which at the same time could
spatially track the position of the smartphone through marker-based
or model-based tracking), by smartphone-integrated sensing, or a
combination of both.

Inspired by the large amount of prior work, we followed an itera-
tive approach with multiple design loops consisting of conceptualiza-
tion, implementation and initial user tests (dogfood tests) [27, 113].
For prototyping purposes we relied on an external outside-in track-
ing system (OptiTrack Prime 13) in conjunction with a HTC Vive
Pro headset.

First, we explored an absolute, position-controlled mapping of
ﬁnger height to the scale of the virtual information space. With
this technique, the height of the ﬁnger above the smartphone dis-
play until a previous empirically determined maximum height (5
cm above the display) was directly mapped to a scale level of the
virtual display. The scaling changed linearly between minimum and
maximum ﬁnger height. While initial user tests indicated that this
mapping felt natural, the accuracy of the technique is dependent on
the the maximum scale of the information space.

To overcome this limitation, we implemented a relative, rate-
controlled mapping, in which the scale level was constantly in-
creased or decreased with a certain speed dependent of the height of
the ﬁnger over the display (see Figure 1, a-d). For this approach, the
volume above the smartphone display was separated into two smaller
spaces of the same size. The ﬁrst space extended from above the
display surface to half a previous deﬁned maximum height. The sec-
ond area extended from this height to the deﬁned maximum height.
If the ﬁnger was in the lower volume, the scale level increased. If
the ﬁnger was in the upper volume, the scale level decreased. The
point between those areas at half maximum height, theoretically
would result in a scale change of 0. We experimented with a ”dead
zone” in the center (i.e. expanding the volume in which no scale
change would occur).
Initial user tests, indicated that the scale
change around the center was sufﬁciently low that no extended dead
zone was necessary. We also experimented with a dead zone directly
above the touch surface but came to similar conclusions.

For zooming out, a zoom base speed parameter determining the
maximum reachable zoom speed was multiplied with the ﬁnger
height above the display normalized between half maximum height
and maximum height. The result was used to decrease the map size
by this factor. Similarly, for zooming in, the height was normalized
between half maximum height and the minimum ﬁnger height, see
Figure 1.
If the user touched the screen however, the zooming
process was stopped so she could still conduct touchscreen input
without constantly zooming in or moving on the other axes.

The movement on the two other axes in both techniques was han-
dled equally. The position of the ﬁnger on the x axis or respectively
the y axis relative to the display middle point was multiplied with
a plane base speed parameter and was used to determine the speed
in this direction, resulting in a rate-controlled change of the x,y
position. In order to make sure that the user could always see where
exactly the ﬁngertip was hovering, a small ﬂat white disc with a 5
mm diameter indicated where a ray cast perpendicular to the touch
surface would hit the display. This point also functioned as the pivot
point for zooming.

Initial user tests indicated that the rate-controlled mapping re-
sulted in both in better performance (i.e. task completion time) and
was more preferred than the absolute one. Especially, on the larger
map we tested (1.392m * 0.655m and a touchscreen width to virtual
map width ratio of 1:13,2 compared to 13.92m * 6.55m and a ratio
of 1:132), the user would have to zoom more to get to the mini-
mum scale level. Speciﬁcally, the range between the display surface
and a physically possible maximum ﬁnger height was too small to
provide a smooth scale change. A small change in ﬁnger height
would map to a large scale change. This made accurate and precise
navigation very difﬁcult. Compared to this, the relative movement
was perceived much more smooth and precise on all map sizes.

All base speed parameters were empirically determined. For the
zoom base speed, this value was 0.05 and for the plane base speed,
this value was 0.001. Please note that the zoom speed constant
of 0.05 is dependent on the maximum ﬁnger height (in our case
5 cm) and the plane base speed parameter is dependent on the
smartphone display size. For other ﬁnger heights or display sizes
those parameters can be linearly interpolated. Also, the maximum
ﬁnger height of 5 centimeters above the display empirically produced
the best results for various users.

4 USER STUDY

We aimed to compare the relative, rate-controlled mapping, which
outperformed the absolute, position-controlled mapping in initial
tests, with commonly used technique for navigating 2D information
spaces on touch screens. To this end, we utilized the well known
pinch-to-zoom and drag to pan interaction techniques and conducted
a multiscale target search and selection task in a map navigation
scenario.

4.1 Study Design

We followed a within-subjects design with two independent vari-
ables: INTERFACE and MAP SIZE.

INTERFACE had two levels: 3D NAVIGATION utilized the relative
above surface interaction technique described in the previous sec-
tion. The BASELINE condition utilized 2D pinch to zoom and drag
to pan known from mobile map applications. The parameters for pan
and zoom were chosen to mimic the Google Maps pan and zoom
experience on the smartphone used in the user study (see Apparatus
section), including inertia and pivot point for zooming. The BASE-
LINE technique utilized the smartphone touch screen for sensing.
We also veriﬁed that the navigation performance when wearing a
VR HMD matches performance when not wearing an HMD but
interacting with a mobile phone only version of the application. A
small white ﬂat disc was used to visualize the pivot point of zooming,
in this case the middle point between the two ﬁngers used for zoom.
The users’ ﬁngers used for interaction (typically thumb and index
ﬁnger of the dominant hand) were visualized as colored spheres with
10 mm diameter (same as the target size).

There were two MAP SIZEs: SMALL MAP had a size of 1.45 m
* 0.69 m resulting in ratio between touch screen width to virtual
map width of 1:13.8. LARGE MAP had a size of 144.71 * 69.11 m
resulting in ratio between touch screen width to virtual map width of
1:1380. In a pilot study, we evaluated an additional map size (with a
touchscreen width to virtual map width ratio of 1:138), but found
no additional insights compared to the large map size and, hence,
excluded it from the main study.

Within each of the four conditions (2 INTERFACEs x 2 MAP SIZEs,
participants needed to select targets at three TARGET DISTANCEs:
SMALL DISTANCE, MEDIUM DISTANCE and LARGE DISTANCE. The
order of TARGET DISTANCE was randomized within each condition,
ensuring that each of the three TARGET DISTANCES appeared exactly
ﬁve times per condition. The target distances were deﬁned relative to
the length of the diagonal of each MAP SIZE corresponding to 0.125
* map diagonal for SMALL DISTANCE, 0.25 * map diagonal for

Figure 2: Left: View on the VR scene in the 3D NAVIGATION condition at a small scale. The active target is shown as blue dot, inactive targets
as red dots. The pink sphere indicates the ﬁngertip position, the white disc below the pivot point for zooming. The touch screen area of the
smartphone is shown as semi-transparent blue rectangle with red border. Right: View on the VR scene in the BASELINE condition at 1:1 scale.
The circular targets are complemented with 3D ﬂag symbols to indicate that targets can be selected. The two ﬁngertips used for zooming are
indicated by yellow and pink spheres. The pivot point indicated by the white disc is visualized half-way between both ﬁngertips.

MEDIUM DISTANCE and 0.5 * map diagonal for LARGE DISTANCE.
Hence, SMALL DISTANCE corresponded to 0.2 m on the SMALL MAP
and 20 m on the LARGE MAP. MEDIUM DISTANCE corresponded
to 0.4 m on the SMALL MAP and 40 m on the LARGE MAP. LARGE
DISTANCE corresponded to 0.8 m on the SMALL MAP and 80 m on
the LARGE MAP.

The conditions were blocked by MAP SIZE, i.e. the starting order
of INTERFACE was counter-balanced within each MAP SIZE but
both INTERACTION TECHNIQUEs were conducted sequentially for a
single MAP SIZE. The order of MAP SIZE was also counterbalanced
(e.g., participant i starting with MAP SIZE SMALL MAP, participant
i+1 starting with LARGE MAP.

4.2 Task

Participants were asked to conduct a target search and acquisition
task. To this end, they had to identify a target on the map, navigate
to the target and eventually select it.

In each condition, the participants were asked to ﬁnd and click
a total of 15 circular targets with a diameter of 10 mm on a map.
This target size was scale-independent (i.e. the target was always
displayed with a 10 mm diameter), but the target could only be
selected in the largest map scale (zoomed in to the maximum scale
level). The active target was highlighted in blue, while all other
potential targets were colored red. In order to click the target, the
participant had to navigate close enough so that the target was inside
the touch screen bounds (and at scale level 1:1). When this was
achieved, it was possible to selecting it by dwelling the ﬁnger on
the real world smartphone display at the target location for one
second. This delay time was used to separate an accidental touch
from an indented click. If the participant failed to hit the target at
ﬁrst attempt, an error was logged. In order to progress to the next
marker, the participant still had to eventually achieve a successful
hit afterwards. After successfully selecting the target, a new target
was highlighted. The new target was always selected to ﬁt a certain
distance to the previous target, respectively the origin for the ﬁrst
target. Those distances were separated in three categories. Near,
middle and far. Each target distance was randomly used 5 times
adding up to 15 total targets per condition. The task started at the
maximum scale level.

4.3 Procedure

After welcoming, participants were asked to ﬁll out a demographic
questionnaire. This was followed by a short tutorial video, which
gave ﬁrst information about the to be fulﬁlled tasks and the two
implemented interaction techniques. Thereafter, we conducted a
training phase for the ﬁrst condition, in which participants clicked
6 targets, 2 of each distance type, to get used to the controls. This
training phase was later repeated before each condition with the

respective technique. After ﬁnishing this training phase, the actual
test condition was carried out. After each condition, the participant
ﬁlled out three questionnaires, the system usability scale SUS [14],
the NASA Task Load Index TLX [42] and the Simulator Sickness
Questionaire SSQ [49]. The conditions were blocked by MAP SIZE.
The starting order of the blocks (SMALL MAP and LARGE MAP) as
well as the order of the INTERFACEs in each block were balanced
across participants. After each block, the participants answered
an additional questionnaire concerning their personal preferences
related to both methods. After the ﬁrst block, the participants had
the possibility to take a 10 minute break before proceeding with
the next block. Following both blocks and all questionnaires, the
participants were asked to participate in a semi-structured interview,
in which further feedback was collected. Finally, participants were
thanked and compensated with a 10 Euro voucher.

The duration of each condition was strongly dependent on the
speed of the participant, the map size and the used navigation method.
Together with the questionnaires and the short interview, the overall
average duration of the experiment was 60 minutes.

4.4 Apparatus

For capturing the touch input and sending it via WiFi to the main
application on a PC, we used an Android application on an Amazon
Fire Phone running Fire OS 4.6.3. The smartphone dimensions
were 139.2 mm 66.5 mm 8.9 mm (width x height x depth), with a
touchscreen of size 105 mm x 60 mm. For 3D Tracking, we used
an OptiTrack Prime 13 system, consisting of 8 cameras, of which
3 were Prime 13w wide ﬁeld-of-view cameras and Motive Version
1.10.3. The main study application was a running on a PC with
windows 10, an Intel Xeon E5 - 1650 CPU, a Nvidia GeForce GTX
1070 graphics card and 64 GB RAM. The VR Headset used was
the HTC Vive Pro. Both applications, the one on the smartphone as
much as the one running on the PC were created in Unity 2018.3.2f1.
While the HTC Vive Pro and the ﬁngertips of users could have been
tracked with mobile sensing solutions [92] the HMD and ﬁngers
were equipped with retro-reﬂective markers for increased accuracy,
see Figure 4.

4.5 Participants

We recruited 20 participants from a university campus with diverse
study backgrounds. All participants were familiar with touch sen-
sitive screens. From the 20 participants (7 female, 13 male, mean
age 24.4 years, sd = 2.973, mean height 175.8 cm, sd = 9.463, 15

3 participants rarely but more than once, 5 participants occasion-
ally and 2 often. Three participants indicated they don’t play video
games, 1 participant only once, 4 rarely, 6 occasionally, 3 frequently
and 3 very frequently. Five participants wore contact lenses or

sickness ratings were detected between conditions.

4.6.1 Target Acquisition Time
The times to acquire individual targets averaged over all target dis-
tances are depicted in Figure 3, left (for individual distances, see
Appendix). An omnibus test revealed signiﬁcance main effects of
INTERFACE (F1,18 = 59.91, p < .001, η 2
p = 0.77, 1 − β = 1.0), and
(as expected) for MAP SIZE (F1,18 = 199.05, p < .001, η 2
p = 0.92,
1 − β = 1.0) and TARGET DISTANCE (F2,36 = 45.83, p < .001,
η 2

p = 0.72, 1 − β = 1.0).
As expected, signiﬁcant interactions have been indicated between
INTERFACE and MAP SIZE (F1,36 = 29.61, p < 0.001, η 2
p = 0.622,
1 − β = 0.99), MAP SIZE and TARGET DISTANCE (F2,36 = 11.08,
p > 0.001, η 2
p = 0.38, 1 − β = 0.99), but not between INTERFACE
and TARGET DISTANCE (F2,36 = 3.06, p = 0.059, η 2
p = 0.15, 1 −
β = 0.56). We did not observe any asymmetrical effects [82].

Holm-Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc testing revealed that there
were signiﬁcant differences between each level for target distance
(p < 0.001, as expected), map size (p < 0.001, as expected) and
between BASELINE (mean target acquisition time over all map sizes
and target distances: 59.62 seconds, sd = 23.95) and 3D NAVIGA-
TION (mean target acquisition time over all map sizes and target
distances: 33.52 seconds, sd = 8.10) (p < 0.001).

Also, Holm-Bonferroni adjusted pairwise t-tests between BASE-
LINE and 3D NAVIGATION for each combination of MAP SIZE
and TARGET DISTANCE indicated that 3D NAVIGATION resulted in
signiﬁcantly faster target acquisition times compared to BASELINE.
Similar results were obtained when excluding one participant
whose target acquistion times were substantially larger than the
times of the other participants (depicted as outlier in Figure 3, left).
These results are omitted for brevity.

In other words, participants acquired targets signiﬁcantly faster

with 3D NAVIGATION compared to BASELINE.

4.6.2 Errors
We looked at two different error types. First, we looked at the
number of wrongly selected targets. No target selection error was
made in any condition. Second, we counted the occasions when a
target was not hit at ﬁrst touch down (i.e. the ﬁnger was dwelling
outside of the target circle for more than a second), see Figure 3,
right. No signiﬁcant main effects or interactions were indicated.

In other words, no signiﬁcant differences between 3D NAVIGA-

TION and BASELINE were detected.

4.6.3 Workload

weighted NASA TLX [42]) are depicted in Table 1.

right handed while 1 was left handed. Nineteen participants used
their right hand to conduct the task and 1 used the left hand. For
zooming in the 2D BASELINE interface, 15 participants used their
thumb together with their index ﬁnger and ﬁve participants used
their index ﬁnger in combination with their middle ﬁnger.

4.6 Results

Statistical signiﬁcance tests for log-transformed target acquisition
time was carried out using general linear model repeated mea-
sures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with Holm-Bonferroni
adjustments for multiple comparisons at an initial signiﬁcance level
α = 0.05. We indicate effect sizes whenever feasible (η 2
p). We had
to exclude performance data (target acquisition time and errors) for
one participant due to logging errors.

For subjective feedback, or data that did not follow a normal
distribution or could not be transformed to a normal distribution
using the log-transform (errors), we employed the Aligned Rank
Transform before applying RM-ANOVA.

The results in the following sections can be summarized as fol-
lows: Participants acquired targets signiﬁcantly faster with 3D NAV-
IGATION compared to BASELINE. 3D NAVIGATION also resulted in
signiﬁcantly higher SUS scores, signiﬁcantly lower demand ratings
(as indicated by Nasa TLX) and was preferred by more participants.

SUS ratings > 68 (with BASELINE-LARGE MAP resulting in a mean
score of 66).

A signiﬁcant main effect for INTERFACE was indicated for the

interaction between INTERFACE and MAP SIZE was also indicated
(F1,19 = 6.09, p = 0.02, η 2

In other words, 3D NAVIGATION resulted in signiﬁcantly higher

4.6.5 Simulator Sickness

Results from the simulator sickness questionnaire SSQ [49] are de-
picted in Figure 6. Omnibus tests revealed no statistically signiﬁcant
main effects or interactions for any SSQ dimension.

In other words, no signiﬁcant difference for simulator sickness

could be indicated between 3D NAVIGATION and BASELINE.

4.6.6 Preferences and Open Comments

When asked to rank the interaction techniques, all 20 participants
preferred 3D NAVIGATION for LARGE MAP. For SMALL MAP, 15
participants preferred 3D NAVIGATION and 5 preferred BASELINE.
As beneﬁts of 3D NAVIGATION, 8 participants mentioned it to
be faster with one saying I have the feeling that it is faster” and two
mentioning it was also fast to learn. Three participants mentioned
that they felt it enabled more precise navigation. Five participants
it was easier to learn and ”more ﬂuid” with one mentioning With
2D [BASELINE] I need more steps to zoom in or out. 3D [3D
NAVIGATION] just feels better and four mentioning that using only
a single ﬁnger for navigation felt more intuitive than the 2 ﬁnger
pinch gesture.

Regarding drawbacks of the 3D NAVIGATION technique one
participant mentioned that the fast zooming gave me slight dizziness
on the large map, but all in all its better, because it is faster. Another
participant mentioned I was losing the feeling on zoom range on
single colored map parts and 2 participants mentioned that they
accidentally touched the screen, which led to an interruption of the
zoom process.

Regarding beneﬁts of BASELINE, one participant mentioned that
this technique helped better in the ﬁnal stage of the target acquisition
phase by stating For me it was more precise because the frame is
stable in the last step of target acquisition. Two participants men-
tioned that they liked that a hovering ﬁnger does not invoke zooming.
Three participants mentioned that they like the technique because
they were used to it and three mentioned that they felt the technique
to be fast enough on the small map. In contrast, two participants
also mentioned that the technique was too slow for navigating on the
large map as well as to imprecise. Another participant mentioned my
ﬁngertips start to hurt if I touch the displays or things [in BASELINE]
for too long, 3D on the other hand feels nice.

We further noticed differences regarding the amount of zooming
used by the participants in the different conditions. Overall, the
participants zoomed less on SMALL MAP for both interfaces. On

a normalized scale, where 0 equals the minimum zoom scale (i.e.
the whole map is visible within the smartphone boundaries) and
1 equals the maximum scale, the average scale across all partici-
pants was 0.425 for 2D Navigation and 0.357 for 3D Navigation on
SMALL MAP, compared to 0.065 and 0.064 for 2D Navigation and
3D Navigation on LARGE MAP (please remember that participants
started the task at the maximum scale 1 and had to be at that scale in
order to select a target). In 70 instances for BASELINE respectively
30 instances for 3D NAVIGATION on SMALL MAP, the participants
found and clicked the highlighted target without zooming out at
all. However, this was never the case in any of both conditions on
LARGE MAP. Those differences can be attributed to the fact that
on SMALL MAP, a larger proportion of the map was already in the
participants ﬁeld of view when zoomed in.

5 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS

Our study indicated that the proposed relative, rate-controlled tech-
nique outperformed the BASELINE technique in terms of task com-
pletion time on both MAP SIZEs. No differences in terms of errors
were detected. While we assumed that potentially, differences be-
tween the conditions could appear for simulator sickness due to the
faster scale change in 3D NAVIGATION, this assumption was not
conﬁrmed by the SSQ ratings.

The indications from workload and usability ratings were more
nuanced. While for workload, 3D NAVIGATION resulted in signif-
icantly lower frustration and overall demand for both MAP SIZEs,
for the TLX dimensions temporal effort, performance and effort
signiﬁcant differences were solely indicated for the LARGE MAP.
No signiﬁcant differences were indicated for mental or physical
demand. One potential explanation for this might be that while
holding the ﬁnger in mid-air (even with support of the palm lying
on a resting surface) might induce fatigue, so does the repetitive use
of pinch-to-zoom gestures.

Also, regarding usability ratings, 3D NAVIGATION was solely
rated signiﬁcantly higher for the LARGE MAP. These quantitative
results are also echoed by the qualitative feedback. While for LARGE
MAP all participants preferred 3D NAVIGATION, for SMALL MAP,
ﬁve out 20 preferred the BASELINE condition. This is also reﬂected
by one participant stating ”2D [baseline] on the small map is man-
ageable but on the big map it is too much trouble”.

With these ﬁndings in mind, we can still suggest the proposed
relative, rate-control navigation technique can serve as viable option
for navigating multiscale planar information spaces on and above
touchscreens.

As a limitation we can see, that in the experiment, the smart-
phone was lying on a surface, which also functioned as a resting
surface for both interaction techniques. While this represents well
the intended target usage in physical constrained spaces such as an
airplane seat with a tray, other use cases, such as free hand usage
or usage while walking could result in other ﬁndings, speciﬁcally
regarding expected fatigue of the techniques. Further, in such sce-
narios, approaches that utilize the touchscreen pose for spatially
navigating an information space (such as the work by Spindler et
al. [100]) could be used and potentially outperform the proposed
approach. Also, the results might change if other form factors such
as tablets will be employed. Further, while we took care to select
a representative range of information space sizes, the results might
change when investigating further scales. Finally, one could argue
that given spatial ﬁnger tracking on modern VR headsets, there is
no need for a supporting touchscreen at all. While this is true for
spatial interaction, and, eventually for sliding motions on physical
surfaces such as tables, selecting items through nuanced touches
on the surface without touchscreens (or other contact-based sen-
sors) will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. Not using a
touchscreen also strips away further potential interaction possibili-
ties (which we did not investigate in this work) that could arise due

to the tangible nature of smartphones and tablets [107].

6 CONCLUSION

The combination of physical touchscreen devices such as smart-
phones and tablets with Virtual Reality headsets enables unique
interaction possibilities such as the exploration of large information
spaces.

In this context, a controlled laboratory study with 20 partici-
pants indicated that a relative, rate-controlled multiscale navigation
technique resulted in signiﬁcantly better performance and user pref-
erence compared to pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-pan when navigating
planar information spaces.

In future work, we plan to investigate the technique in further
usage scenarios (such when standing or walking) and to explore
the rich interaction space that opens up when combining traditional
compute devices such as smartphones, tablets or notebooks with VR
headsets capable of spatial tracking of the HMD, traditional input
devices such as smartphones and the user’s hands.
