Fig. 1. Our real-time mobile 3D pose estimation system is based on a single monocular cap-mounted ﬁsheye camera that is attached
to a standard baseball cap. The setup is lightweight and enables 3D pose estimation in everyday situations.

Abstract— We propose the ﬁrst real-time system for the egocentric estimation of 3D human body pose in a wide range of unconstrained
everyday activities. This setting has a unique set of challenges, such as mobility of the hardware setup, and robustness to long capture
sessions with fast recovery from tracking failures. We tackle these challenges based on a novel lightweight setup that converts a
standard baseball cap to a device for high-quality pose estimation based on a single cap-mounted ﬁsheye camera. From the captured
egocentric live stream, our CNN based 3D pose estimation approach runs at 60 Hz on a consumer-level GPU. In addition to the
lightweight hardware setup, our other main contributions are: 1) a large ground truth training corpus of top-down ﬁsheye images and 2)
a disentangled 3D pose estimation approach that takes the unique properties of the egocentric viewpoint into account. As shown by
our evaluation, we achieve lower 3D joint error as well as better 2D overlay than the existing baselines.

1 INTRODUCTION

The goal of this work is to solve the problem of mobile 3D human pose
estimation in a wide range of activities performed in unconstrained real
world scenes, such as walking, biking, cooking, doing sports and ofﬁce
work. The resulting 3D pose can be used for action recognition, motion
control, and performance analysis in ﬁelds such as sports, animation
and health-care. A real-time solution to this problem is also desirable
for many virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications.
Such 3D human pose estimation in daily real world situations im-
poses a unique set of requirements on the employed capture setup and
algorithm, such as: mobility, real-time performance, robustness to long
capture sequences and fast recovery from tracking failures. In the past,
many works for outside-in 3D human pose estimation have been pro-

posed, which use a single or multiple cameras placed statically around
the user [13, 32, 33, 37, 40, 50]. However, daily real world situations
make outside-in capture setups impractical, since they are immobile,
can not be placed everywhere, require a recording space without oc-
cluders in front of the subject, and have only a small recording volume.
Motion capture systems based on body-worn sensors, such as iner-
tial measurement units (IMUs) [63] or multi-camera structure-from-
motion (SFM) from multiple limb-mounted cameras [46], support
mobile capturing. However, these setups are expensive, require tedious
pre-calibration, and often require pose optimization over the entire
sequence, which prevents real-time performance. Most closely related
to our approach is the EgoCap [39] system that is based on two head
mounted ﬁsheye cameras. While it alleviates the problem of a limited
capture volume, the setup is quite heavy and requires uncomfortable,
obtrusive large extension-sticks. EgoCap also requires dedicated 3D
actor model initialization based on keyframes, does not run at real-time
rates for the full body, and has not been shown to be robust on very
long sequences.

In contrast, we tackle the unique challenges of real-time ubiquitous
mobile 3D pose estimation with a novel lightweight hardware setup
(see Fig. 1) that converts a standard baseball cap to a device for accurate
3D human pose estimation using a single ﬁsheye camera. Our approach
fulﬁlls all requirements mentioned at the outset: 1) Our hardware setup
is compact, lightweight and power efﬁcient, which makes it suited
for daily mobile use. 2) Our approach requires no actor calibration
and works for general and dynamic backgrounds, which enables free
roaming during daily activities. 3) From the live stream of the cap-

 
 
 
 
 
 
but imposes a constrained recording volume, has high setup time and
cost, and breaks when the subject is occluded in crowded scenes. On
the other hand, mobile hand-held solutions require a team of opera-
tors [16, 65, 69]. In contrast, our system does not require any additional
operators than the user, a multi-camera setup or complicated synchro-
nization and calibration of multi-camera systems. This makes our
system more practical in everyday situations.

Monocular Human Pose Estimation Monocular human pose
estimation is a requirement for many consumer-level applications. For
instance, human-computer interaction in living-room environments
was enabled by real-time pose reconstruction from a single RGB-D
camera [4,47,66]. However, active IR-based cameras are unsuitable for
outdoor capture in sunlight and their high energy consumption limits
their mobile application. Purely RGB-based monocular approaches
for capture in more general scenes have been enabled with the advent
of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and large training datasets
[11, 20, 44, 62]. Methods either operate directly on images [28, 32,
56, 57, 73], lift 2D pose detections to 3D [5, 10, 21, 68, 74], or use
motion compensation and optical ﬂow in videos [1, 58]. The most
recent improvements are due to hierarchical processing [38, 60] and
combining 2D and 3D tasks [33, 36, 72]. Our approach is inspired
by the separation of 2D pose and depth estimation by [72], which,
however, assumes an orthographic projection model that does not apply
to the strong distortion of our ﬁsheye-lens and is different in that
it predicts relative, hip-centered depth instead of absolute distance.
While these approaches enable many new applications, the camera is
either ﬁxed, which imposes a restricted capture volume, or needs to be
operated by a cinematographer that follows the action. We build upon
these monocular approaches. We generalize them to a head-mounted
ﬁsheye setup and address its unique challenges, such as the special
top-down view and the large distortion in the images. The robustness
and accuracy is signiﬁcantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art
by a new training dataset and by exploiting the characteristics of the
head-mounted camera setup with a disentangled 3D pose estimation
approach.

Body-worn Motion Sensors For some studies, the restricted cap-
ture volume of static camera systems is overcome by using inertial mea-
surement units (IMUs) [55,63] or exoskeleton suits (e.g., METAmotion
Gypsy). These form an inside-in arrangement, where the sensors are
body-worn and capture body motion independent of external devices.
Unfortunately, the sensor instrumentation and calibration of the subject
cause long setup times and makes capturing multitudes of people dif-
ﬁcult. Furthermore, IMU measurements require temporal integration
to obtain position estimates, which is commonly addressed by ofﬂine
batch-optimization to minimize drift globally [63]. We aim at lower
setup times and real-time reconstruction with minimal latency, e.g., for
interactive virtual reality experiences.

Mobile Motion Capture Self-contained motion capture in every-
day conditions demands for novel concepts. By attaching 16 cameras
to the subject’s limbs and torso in an inside-out conﬁguration Shiratori
et al. recover the human pose by structure from motion on the environ-
ment, enabling free roaming in static backgrounds [46]. For dynamic
scenes, vision-based inside-in arrangements have been proposed. The
camera placement is task speciﬁc. Facial expression and eye gaze have
been captured with a helmet-mounted camera or rig [24, 54, 64], hand
articulation and action from head-mounted [51, 52, 67] or even wrist- or
chest-worn cameras [26, 43]. The user’s gestures and activity can also
be recognized from a ﬁrst-person perspective [8, 14, 27, 31, 35].

However, capturing accurate full body motion in such a body-
mounted inside-in camera arrangement is considerably more challeng-
ing, as it is difﬁcult to observe the whole body from such close proxim-
ity. Yonemoto et al. propose indirect inference of arm and torso poses
from arm-only RGB-D footage [70] and Jiang attempted to reconstruct
full-body pose by analyzing the egomotion and observed scene [22],
but indirect predictions have low conﬁdence and accuracy. A ﬁrst ap-
proach towards direct full-body motion capture from the egocentric
perspective was proposed by Rhodin et al. [39]. A 3D kinematic skele-
ton model is optimized to explain 2D features in each of the views of

mounted camera, our approach estimates 3D human pose at 60 Hz.
4) Our online frame-by-frame pose estimation solution is suitable for
capturing long sequences and automatically recovers from occasional
failures.

As is true for most of the recent outside-in monocular 3D human
pose estimation methods, our approach is also based on a deep neural
network. However, existing methods do not apply well to our setting.
First, their training data is captured with regular cameras and mostly
from chest high viewpoints. Thus, they fail on our images, which are
captured from a top-down view and exhibit a large radial distortion
(see Fig. 2). Second, most of the existing methods directly estimate 3D
human pose in the form of 3D joint locations relative to the pelvis and
do not respect the 2D-3D consistency. This not only makes them yield
bad 2D overlay of 3D pose results on the images, but also makes the
3D pose estimation less accurate, since even a small 2D displacement
translates to a large 3D error due to the short focal length of the ﬁsheye
camera. Third, the close proximity of the camera to the head creates
a strong perspective distortion, resulting in a large upper body and
very small lower body in the images, which makes the estimation of
the lower body less accurate. To solve these problems, we propose
a new ground truth training corpus of top-down ﬁsheye images and,
more importantly, a novel 3D pose estimation algorithm based on
a CNN that is speciﬁcally tailored to the uniqueness of our camera
position and optics. Speciﬁcally, instead of directly regressing the
3D joint locations, we disentangle the 3D pose estimation problem to
the following three subproblems: 1) 2D joint detection from images
with large perspective and radial distortions, which is solved with a
two-scale location invariant convolutional network, 2) absolute camera-
to-joint distance estimation, which is solved with a location sensitive
distance module that exploits the spatial dependencies induced by the
radial distortion and ﬁxed camera placement relative to the head and 3)
recovering the actual joint position by back-projecting the 2D detections
using the distance estimate and the optical properties of the ﬁsheye
lens. Our disentangled approach leads to not only accurate 3D pose
estimation, but also good 2D overlay of results, since, by construction,
the 3D joint locations will exactly re-project to the corresponding 2D
detections.

To the best of our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst approach that
performs real-time mobile 3D human pose estimation from a single
egocentric ﬁsheye camera. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline meth-
ods on our test set. Our datasets and code are publicly available at
http://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/wxu/Mo2Cap2/.

2 RELATED WORK
In the following, we categorize relevant motion capture approaches in
terms of the employed setup.

Studio and Multi-view Motion Capture Multi-view motion
capture in a studio typically employs ten or more cameras. For
marker-based systems the subject has to be instrumented, e.g., with
a marker or LED suit. Marker-less motion-capture algorithms over-
come this constraint [6, 15, 19, 25, 34, 48, 49, 53, 59, 61], with recent
work [2, 7, 13, 37, 40, 42, 50] even succeeding in outdoor scenes and
using fewer cameras. The static camera setup ensures high accuracy

a stereo ﬁsheye camera mounted on head-extensions similar in struc-
ture to a selﬁe stick. While enabling free roaming many application
scenarios are hampered by the bulky stereo hardware. This approach
achieves interactive framerates for upper body tracking only, while
ours enables real-time 3D pose estimation for the full human body. To
be less intrusive, we propose a lightweight hardware setup based on a
single cap-mounted ﬁsheye camera, which requires an entirely different
reconstruction algorithm since the optimization used by Rhodin et al.
intrinsically requires stereo vision with a large baseline. Furthermore,
our algorithm is capable of estimating 3D pose from a single frame,
which reduces the chance of long-term tracking failures and enables
capture of arbitrarily long sequences without manual intervention.

3 THE MO2 CAP2 APPROACH
Mo2Cap2 is a real-time approach for mobile 3D human body pose
estimation based on a single cap-mounted ﬁsheye camera. Our headgear
augments a standard baseball cap with an attached ﬁsheye camera. It is
lightweight, comfortable and very easy to put on. However, the usage
of only one camera view, the very slanted and proximate viewpoint and
the ﬁsheye distortion makes 3D pose estimation extremely challenging.
We address these challenges by a novel disentangled 3D pose estimation
algorithm based on a CNN that is speciﬁcally tailored to our setup. We
also contribute a large scale training corpus of synthetic top-down view
ﬁsheye images with ground truth annotations. It covers a wide range of
body motion and appearance. In the following, we provide more details
on these aspects.

3.1 Lightweight Hardware Setup
Our work is the ﬁrst approach that performs 3D real-time human
body pose estimation from a single head-mounted camera. Previous
work [39] has demonstrated successful motion capture with a helmet-
mounted ﬁsheye stereo pair. While their results are promising, their
setup has a number of practical disadvantages. Since they mount each
of the cameras approximately 25 cm away from the forehead, the weight
of the two cameras translates into a large moment, making their helmet
quite uncomfortable to wear. Furthermore, their large stereo baseline
of 30-40 cm in combination with the large forehead-to-camera distance
forces the actor to stay far away from walls and other objects, which
limits usability of the approach in many everyday situations.

In contrast, our setup is based on a single ﬁsheye camera mounted
to the brim of a standard baseball cap (see Fig. 1), which leads to a
lightweight, comfortable and easy-to-use head-gear. Installed only 8cm
away from the head, the weight of our camera (only 175g) translates
to a very small moment, which makes our setup practical for many
scenarios. Note, there exist even smaller/lighter cameras we could use,
without making any algorithmic changes to our method. One could even
integrate the small camera inside the brim, which would make the setup
even lighter. Such engineering improvements are possible, but beyond
the scope of this paper. Our ﬁsheye camera has a 182◦ ﬁeld of view
in both the horizontal and vertical direction. This allows capturing the
full body under a wide range of motion, including fully extended arms.
However, our hardware setup also makes 3D pose estimation more
challenging since 1) explicit depth is not available in our monocular
setup and 2) due to the shorter forehead to camera distance, the body
is viewed quite obliquely. Solving 3D pose estimation under such
challenging conditions is the key contribution of our paper.

3.2 Synthetic Training Corpus
We now present our egocentric ﬁsheye training corpus that enables
training of a deep neural network that is tailored to our unique hardware
setup. Capturing a large amount of annotated 3D pose data is already a
mammoth task for outside-in setups and it is even harder for egocentric
data. Since manual labeling in 3D space is impractical, [39] proposes
to use marker-less multi-view motion capture with externally mounted
cameras to get 3D annotations.

However, even with the help of such professional motion capture
systems, acquiring a large number of annotated real-life training exam-
ples for the egocentric viewpoint is still a time consuming and tedious
recording task. It requires to capture the training data in a complex

multi-view studio environment and precise 6 DOF tracking of the cap-
mounted camera, such that the 3D body pose can be reprojected to the
egocentric viewpoint of interest. Furthermore, scalability to general
scenes requires foreground/background augmentation, which typically
relies on extra effort of capturing with green screen and image seg-
mentation with color keying. Given the difﬁculty of capturing a large
amount of training data, the EgoCap [39] system does not scale to
a large corpus of motions and real world diversity of human bodies
in terms of shape and appearance, as well as diversity of real scene
backgrounds. Furthermore, their dataset cannot be directly used for our
method, due to the different camera position relative to the head.

In contrast, we alleviate these difﬁculties by rendering a synthetic
human body model from the egocentric ﬁsheye view. Note that the
success of any learning based method largely depends on how well
the training corpus resembles the real world in terms of motion, body
appearance and environment realism. Therefore, care must be taken
to ensure that 1) the variety of motion and appearance is maximized
and 2) that the differences between synthetic and real images are mini-
mized. On one hand, to achieve a large variety of training examples, we
build our dataset on top of the large scale synthetic human SURREAL
dataset [62]. We animate characters using the SMPL body model [30]
with uniformly sampled motions from the CMU MoCap dataset [12].
Body textures are chosen randomly from the texture set provided by
the SURREAL dataset [62]. In total, we render 530,000 images (see
Fig. 3), which encompass around 3000 different actions and more than
700 different body textures. On the other hand, to generate realistic
training images, we mimic the camera, lighting and background of the
real world scenario. Speciﬁcally, images are rendered from a virtual
ﬁsheye camera attached to the forehead of the character at a distance
similar to the size of the brim of the used real world baseball cap. To
this end, we calibrate the real world ﬁsheye camera using the omni-
directional camera calibration toolbox ocamcalib [45] and apply the
intrinsic calibration parameters to the virtual camera. Characters are
rendered using a custom shader that models the radial distortion of
the ﬁsheye camera. Note that the camera position with respect to the
head might change slightly, due to the camera movements and vary-
ing wearing angles and positions of the cap. To simulate this effect,
we add a random perturbation to the virtual ﬁsheye camera position.
Random spherical harmonics illumination is used with a special pa-
rameterization to ensure a realistic top down illumination. All images
are augmented with the backgrounds chosen randomly from a set of
more than 5000 indoor and outdoor ground plane images captured by
our ﬁsheye camera. To gather such background images, we attach the
ﬁsheye camera to a long stick to obtain images that do not show the
person holding the camera. Furthermore, we applied a random gamma
correction to the rendered images, such that the network becomes in-
sensitive to the speciﬁc photometric response characteristics of the used
camera.

Our synthetic dataset contains the ground truth annotation of 2D and
3D joint positions, which can be easily generated using the body model

Fig. 4. Our disentangled 3D pose estimation method, which is speciﬁcally tailored to our cap-mounted ﬁsheye camera setup, consists of three
modules: The two branched 2D module estimates the 2D joint location heatmaps of the full body from the original image and the lower body from
the zoom-in image. The distance module estimates the distance between the camera and each joint. The joint position module recovers the
actual joint position by back-projecting the 2D detection using the joint-to-camera distance estimate and the intrinsic calibration of the ﬁsheye camera.

and the camera calibration. Speciﬁcally, we provide the joint positions
of the following 15 body joints: neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips,
knees, ankles and toes. The 3D joint positions are with respect to
the ﬁsheye camera coordinate system for our egocentric setup. The
joint-to-camera distances are computed based on the 3D joint position
(see Sec. 3.3). The 2D joint position annotation is provided in the
form of 2D heatmaps. To this end, we ﬁrst project the ground truth 3D
joint positions onto the image space using the camera calibration. The
projections are then resized to a resolution of 64 × 64, and we put a
Gaussian kernel of size 5 × 5 and standard deviation 0.8 at each of the
2D joint positions. Finally, the 2D heatmaps are further downsampled
to 32 × 32.

3.3 Monocular Fisheye 3D Pose Estimation
Our disentangled 3D pose estimation method consists of three modules
(see Fig. 4).

The 2D module of our method estimates 2D heatmaps of the joint
locations in image space, where we adopt a fully convolutional architec-
ture that is suited for 2D detection problems. As mentioned before, the
strong perspective distortion of our setup makes the lower body appear
particularly small in the images and therefore leads to lower accuracy
in the estimation of the lower body joints. To solve this problem, we
propose a 2D pose estimation module consisting of two independently
trained branches, which see different parts of the images. The origi-
nal scale branch sees the complete images and predicts the 2D pose
heatmaps of 15 joints in the full body. The zoom-in branch only sees
the 2× zoomed central part of the original images. This zoom-in branch
predicts the 2D heatmaps of the 8 lower body joints (hips, knees, ankle
and toes), since these joints project into this central region in most of
the images captured by our cap-mounted camera. Our zoom-in branch
yields more accurate results on the lower body than the original scale
branch, since it sees the images at 2× higher resolution. The lower
body heatmaps from the two branches are then averaged.

The distance module performs a vectorized regression of per-joint
absolute camera space depth, i.e., the distance between the camera
and each joint, based on the higher and medium level features of
the 2D module. In contrast to the fully convolutional architecture of
our 2D module, here we use a fully connected layer that can exploit
the spatial dependencies in our setup induced by the radial distortion
and ﬁxed camera placement relative to the head. Please note that
absolute distance estimation is not practical for the classical outside-in

camera setup, where the subject is ﬁrst cropped in 2D to a normalized
pixel scale from which 3D pose is estimated, by which absolute scale
information is lost.

At last, the joint position module recovers the actual joint position
by back-projecting the 2D detections using the distance estimate and
the intrinsic calibration (including the distortion-coefﬁcients) of the
ﬁsheye camera. To this end, we ﬁrst read out the u, v coordinates of
each joint from the averaged heatmaps. Then, given the calibration of
the ﬁsheye camera [45], each 2D joint detection [u, v]T can be mapped
to its corresponding 3D ray vector [x, y, z]T with respect to the ﬁsheye
camera coordinate system:

Our disentangled 3D pose estimation method ensures that the 3D
joint location will exactly reproject to its 2D detection, handles the
scale difference between upper and lower body and leverages location
dependent information of the egocentric setup as a valuable depth cue,
and therefore results in more accurate 3D pose estimation than previous
architectures trained on the same data.

Implementation of our network Each branch of our 2D module
consists of 15 residual blocks [18] and performs a deconvolution and
two convolutions to upsample the prediction to the heatmap size of
32 × 32 pixels given images of resolution 256 × 256 pixels as input.
In addition to the euclidean (cid:96)2 loss on the ﬁnal heatmap predictions,
we add two additional intermediate supervision losses (after 11 and 14
residual blocks) for faster convergence during training and to prevent
vanishing gradients during back-propagation. The architecture of the
distance module is based on 2 additional residual blocks, 2 convolution
and 1 fully connected layer. We concatenate the output features of the

pose estimation approach leads to signiﬁcant gains in reconstruction
accuracy.

Multi-stage Training Our training corpus is based on synthetically
rendered images. To make our network better generalize to real world
imagery, we train it in multiple stages using transfer learning. First,
we pre-train the 2D module of our network on an outside-in pose esti-
mation task based on the MPII Human Pose [3] and LSP [23] datasets.
These real images with normal optics enable our network to learn good
low-level features, which, at that feature level, are transferable to our
egocentric ﬁsheye setup. Afterwards, we ﬁne tune the two branches
of the 2D module separately on the images from our synthetically
rendered ﬁsheye training corpus and the 2× zoomed version of them re-
spectively. Note that in order to preserve the low level features learned
from real images, we decrease the learning rate multiplier to 0.001 for
the initial 13 residual blocks. Afterwards, we ﬁx the weights of the 2D
module and train our distance module. The Euclidean loss is used for
the ﬁnal loss and all intermediate losses. In all training stages, we use a
batch size of 24, and we train the 2D module for 50k iterations, and the
distance module for 70k iterations. For the ﬁne tuning stages, we use a
learning rate of 0.05. AdaDelta is used for optimization [71].

4 RESULTS
We study the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach in different
scenarios. Our Mo2Cap2 system runs at 60 Hz on an Nvidia GTX
1080 Ti, which boils down to 16.7 ms for the forward pass. Thus,
our approach can be applied in many applications in which real-time
performance is critical, e.g., for motion control in virtual reality.

In the following, we ﬁrst evaluate our approach qualitatively and
quantitatively. Then, we demonstrate that our disentangled 3D human

4.1 Qualitative Results

Our lightweight and non-intrusive hardware setup allows the users to
capture general daily activities. To demonstrate this, we captured a test
set of 5 activities, including both everyday and challenging motions, in
unconstrained environments: 1) making tea in the kitchen, 2) working
in the ofﬁce, 3) playing football, 4) bicycling, and 5) juggling. Each
sequence contains approximately 2000 frames. The sequences cover a
large variety of motions and subject appearances (see Fig. 5 for exam-
ples). We can see that our method estimates accurate 3D poses for all
sequences. Even interactions with other people or objects are captured,
which is a challenge even for multi-view outside-in methods. Note that
we capture the bicycling and juggling sequences to provide a compari-
son with the state-of-the-art egocentric 3D pose estimation approach
of [39], since they also show results for these two actions. We can see
that our monocular method yields comparable and sometimes more
stable results than their binocular method. Also note, in contrast to [39],
our method runs in real-time on the full body, and does not require
3D model calibration of the user or any optimization as post-process.
The complete results on all sequences are shown in the supplementary
video.

4.2 Quantitative Results

Existing, widely used data sets for monocular 3D pose estimation, e.g.,
Human3.6M [20], are designed for outside-in camera perspectives with
normal optics, not our egocentric, body-worn ﬁsheye setup. In turn, our
absolute distance estimation without image cropping only applies to

body-mounted scenarios. In order to evaluate our method quantitatively,
we therefore captured an extra test set with ground truth annotation
containing 8 different actions across 5591 frames, recorded both in-
doors and outdoors with people in general clothing. The recorded
actions include walking, sitting, crawling, crouching, boxing, danc-
ing, stretching and waving. The 3D ground truth is recorded with a
commercial external multi-view marker-less motion capture system [9].
Fig. 6 shows our 3D pose results overlaid on the input images (left)
and from a side view (right), where the ground truth 3D pose is shown
with the thinner skeleton. Since our method does not estimate the
global translation and rotation of the body, in order to quantitatively
compare our method to the ground truth, we apply Procrustes analysis
to register our results to the ground truth. Following many other 3D
pose estimation methods [32, 33], we rescale the bone length of our
estimated pose to the “universal” skeleton for quantitative evaluation.
The average per-joint 3D error (in millimeters) on different actions is
shown in Tab. 1. Note that our accuracy is comparable with monocular
outside-in 3D pose estimation approaches, even though our setting is
much more challenging.

4.3 Inﬂuence of the Network Architecture

We also quantitatively compare our disentangled architecture to other
state-of-the-art baseline approaches (see Tab. 1) on our egocentric ﬁsh-
eye data. The latter were originally developed for outside-in capture
from undistorted camera views. Speciﬁcally, we compare to the vector-
ized 3D body pose prediction network of [32] (referred to as 3DV’17)
and the location map approach used in [33] (referred to as VNect).
As all three methods are based on a ResNet, we modify their archi-
tectures to use the same number of ResNet blocks as ours for a fair
comparison. We also apply the same intermediate supervision to all
three method and use the same training strategy. We train all networks
on our synthetic training corpus of egocentric ﬁsheye images. One can
see that our disentangled 3D pose estimation approach outperforms
these two state-of-the-art network architectures by a large margin (in-
doors: 19.5%, outdoors: 14.7% over 3DV’17) in terms of mean joint
error (in mm), see Tab. 1. This demonstrates that our architecture is
especially well suited for our monocular ﬁsheye setup. In addition, our
disentangled representation leads to good 2D overlay, since the 2D and
3D detections are consistent by construction. A comparison of the 2D
overlay results of the three different methods is shown in Fig. 7. One

variations in motion, body shape and appearance. Since we train on
synthetically rendered data, this is easily possible. 2) The reconstruction
of 3D body pose under strong occlusions is challenging, since such
situations are highly ambiguous, such as when the arms are raised
above the head and thus cannot be seen by the camera. In these cases,
there are multiple distinct body poses that could give rise to the same
observation, thus 3D pose estimation can fail. Fortunately, since our
approach works on a per-frame basis, it can recover directly after the
occluded parts become visible again. 3) Our per-frame predictions
may exhibit some temporal instability, similar to previous single-frame
methods. We believe that our approach could be easily extended by
adding temporal stabilization as a post-process, or by using a recurrent
architecture. Several typical failure cases are shown in Fig. 9. Despite
these limitations, we believe, that we took an important step in the
direction of real-time ubiquitous mobile 3D motion capture. Our current
capture setup conveniently augments a widely used fashion item. In
future work, we will explore the design space more broadly and also
experiment with other unconventional body-mounted camera locations.

5 APPLICATIONS
Our egocentric 3D pose estimation system can be used for various
applications such as action recognition, motion control, and perfor-
mance analysis. Especially, our system provides a novel natural human-
computer-interaction (HCI) solution for recent popular virtual reality
(VR) and augmented reality (AR) systems. Speciﬁcally, body gesture-
based HCI translates the natural movements of the user’s body into
tangible actions in a virtual world. This allows the users to immerse
themselves in a virtual environment and interact with the virtual con-
tent more intuitively. Previous solutions typically rely on controllers
or outside-in vision-based tracking systems. In contrast, our system
provides a compact, inside-in and controller-free solution, which can
be integrated in the VR headsets and therefore does not require external
tracking devices. In VR games, our system allows the users to control
a virtual character with their full body movements [41], instead of only
hands for typical controller-based systems. The users will also have
a better perception of their full body movements, which is important
typically for many sports games. Similarly, the same technology can
also be used for sports training or health-care, where the motion capture
results can be used for motion analysis, performance monitoring or fall
detection. In VR/AR-based telepresence applications, our system can
be used to capture the body motion, which can then be used to animate
an avatar, without complicated multi-camera motion capture systems.
Importantly, beneﬁting from our mobile egocentric setup, users are not
restricted to a ﬁxed recording volume and therefore can roam freely
while being captured.

6 CONCLUSION
We proposed the ﬁrst real-time approach for 3D human pose estimation
from a single ﬁsheye camera that is attached to a standard baseball cap.
Our novel monocular setup clearly improves over cumbersome existing
technologies and is an important step towards practical daily full-body

results accurately overlay on the images, while the results of the baseline

can see that our 3D pose results accurately overlay on the images, while
the results of the baseline methods exhibit signiﬁcant offsets.

We further perform an ablation study to evaluate the importance of
the zoom-in branch of our 2D module. We compare to two incomplete
versions of our method: 1) with zoom-in branch completely removed
(referred to as Ours w/o zoom) and 2) without averaging the heatmaps
from the two branches, but only using those from the original scale
branch (referred to as Ours w/o averaging). We can see from Fig. 8
that, beneﬁting from the zoom-in branch, our full method yields sig-
niﬁcantly better overlay of the lower body joints. Quantitatively, our
disentangled strategy alone (Ours w/o zoom) obtains 6mm (8%) and
5mm (5.5%) improvement over 3DV’17 in the indoor and outdoor
scenarios respectively. Using the features from the zoom-in branch in
distance estimation (Ours w/o averaging) gains an additional improve-
ment of 2mm and 1mm. Using the averaged heatmaps (our full method)
yields 7mm (12.5%) and 6mm (7.6%) improvement. This evaluation
shows that the 2D-3D consistency obtained by our disentangled strategy
and the more accurate 2D prediction from the zoom-in branch are the
key contributors to the overall improvement.

4.4 Discussion

We have demonstrated compelling real-time human 3D pose estimation
results from a single cap-mounted ﬁsheye camera. Nevertheless our
approach still has a few limitations that can be addressed in follow-
up work: 1) Similar to all other learning-based approaches, it does
not generalize well to data far outside the span of the training corpus.
This can be alleviated by extending the training corpus to cover larger

motion capture. 3D pose estimation is based on a novel 3D pose
regression network that is speciﬁcally tailored to our setup. We train our
network an a new ground truth training corpus of synthetic top-down
ﬁsheye images, which we will make publicly available. Our evaluation
shows that we achieve lower 3D joint error as well as better 2D overlay
than exisiting baseline methods, when applied to the egocentric ﬁsheye
setting. We see our approach as the basis for many exciting new
applications in several areas, such as action recognition, performance
analysis, and motion control in ﬁelds such as sports, health-care, and
virtual reality.
