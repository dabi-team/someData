ABSTRACT

0 = −0.876±0.067 km s−1

Spatial velocities of all currently known 28 masers having trigonometric parallaxes,
proper motion and line-of-site velocities are reanalyzed using Bottlinger’s equations.
These masers are associated with 25 active star-forming regions and are located in
the range of galactocentric distances 3 < R < 14 kpc. To determine the Galactic
rotation parameters, we used the ﬁrst three Taylor expansion terms of angular rotation
velocity Ω at the galactocentric distance of the Sun R0 = 8 kpc. We obtained the
following solutions: Ω0 = −31.0 ± 1.2 km s−1

−13.2±1.5 km s−1 kpc−1 and circular velocity of the Solar neighborhood rotation V0 =
248±14 km s−1
. Fourier analysis of galactocentric radial velocities of masers VR allowed
us to estimate the wavelength λ = 2.0 ± 0.2 kpc and peak velocity fR = 6.5 ± 2 km
s−1 of periodic perturbations from the density wave and velocity of the perturbations

near the location of the Sun. Phase of the Sun in the density wave is
estimated as χ⊙ ≈ −130o ± 10o. Taking into account perturbations evoked by spiral
density wave we obtained the following non-perturbed components of the peculiar
Solar velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR =

INTRODUCTION

Study of Galactic parameters, especially of the Galactic ro-
tation curve, is of great importance in solving a number of
problems, such as estimating the mass of the Galaxy, de-
termining the distribution of matter, estimating the hidden
mass, studying dynamics and structure of the Galaxy and
its subsystems, etc.

For this purpose masers having trigonometric paral-
laxes, line-of-sight velocities and proper motions (Reid et
al., 2009) are of great interest. Currently measurements of
parallaxes with mean error of several percents are fulﬁlled
with radio interferometers for three tens of masers in the
various active high-mass star-forming regions. Because these
masers are associated with very young (< 105 yr) OB stars,
their kinematics reﬂects the properties of the youngest part
of the Galactic disk.

Analysis of motions of 18 masers was made by a number
of authors (Reid et al., 2009; Baba et al., 2009; Bovy et al.,
2009; McMillan & Binney, 2010). For the ﬁrst time Reid
et al. (2009) suggested that high-mass star-forming regions
15 km s−1) lag circular rotation. McMillan
signiﬁcantly (

≈

c(cid:13) 2010 RAS

& Binney (2010) suggest that much of this lag could be
accounted for by increasing the value of the Solar motion in
the direction of galactic rotation from 5 to 11 km s−1.

±

The question of particular interest is the peculiar veloc-
ity of the Sun with respect to the LSR, (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR.
On the basis of Str¨omberg’s relation, Dehnen & Bin-
ney (1998) determined the vector (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR =
(0.4, 0.6, 0.4) km s−1 using proper motions of
(10.0, 5.3, 7.2)
12000 main sequence stars from the Hipparcos catalogue.
≈
These results were conﬁrmed by Aumer & Binney (2009):
(0.3, 0.5, 0.3) km s−1,
(U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR = (10.0, 5.3, 7.1)
who applied the same method to proper motions from the
revised version of the Hipparcos catalogue (van Leeuwen,
2007). In the work of Sch¨onrich et al. (2010), where gra-
dient of metallicity of stars in the Galactic disk was taken
into account, this velocity is diﬀerent: (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR =
km s−1. Using another
(11.1, 12.2, 7.3)
suggested that
approach, Francis & Anderson (2009)
this velocity is: (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR = (7.5, 13.5.2, 6.8)
(1.0, 0.3, 0.1) km s−1.

(0.7, 0.5, 0.4)

In the present work, we are trying to establish relation-
ship between motions of all currently known masers having

parallaxes, proper motions and line-of-sight velocities, and
parameters of the Galactic spiral density waves (Lin & Shu,
1964), and to estimate components of the peculiar velocity
of the Sun with respect to the LSR. This goal is achieved
by determining parameters of the Galactic rotation curve, as
well as other kinematic parameters, by means of Bottlinger’s
equations. Fourier analysis of periodic deviations of observa-
tional velocities of masers from the Galactic rotation curve
is aimed to obtain some estimates of spiral density wave
parameters.

2 DATA

Input data on methanol masers with trigonometric paral-
laxes and proper motions from VLBI measurements are
taken from the papers of Reid et al. (2009), Rygl et al.
(2010). We added also H2O masers SVS 13 in NGC 1333
(Hirota et al., 2008a), IRAS 22196+6336 in Lynds 1204G
(Hirota et al., 2008b) and G14.33–0.64 (Sato et al., 2010),
with parallaxes and proper motions measured in the frame-
work of VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry)
program. Note that, for maser NGC 281–W listed in Reid
et al. (2009), we used observational data obtained by Rygl
et al. (2010) with the quoted uncertainty for 6.7 GHz masers
smaller than the Sato et al. (2008) 22 GHz masers. For the
nearest star-forming region in Orion, along with the data
on maser Orion–KL (Hirota et al., 2007), we use indepen-
dent VLBA observations of radio star GMR A (Sandstrom
et al., 2007) with line-of-sight velocity with respect to the
5 km s−1 (Bower et al., 2003). It is
LSR (Vr)LSR =
the Bower’s et al. (2003) opinion that the GMR A source
is a young star of T Tau type (WTTS). We use also a very
young object a supergiant S Per (Asaki et al., 2007) with
0.7 km s−1 from Famaey
39.7
line-of-sight velocity Vr =
et al. (2005).

All 28 objects being studied are listed in Table 1. In
Fig. 1, one can see only 25 points because X, Y coordinates
of some objects are very close to each other. For example,
three masers Cep A, IRAS 22198 and L 1206 form practically
a single point in the XY plane.

Fig. 1 is drawn in galactocentric Cartesian coordinates
X and Y . As one can see from this picture, only one maser
has inaccurately measured parallax. That is the maser W51
(in the ﬁrst Galactic quadrant), with relative error of par-
allax eπ/π = 0.36. In fact, only this maser requires calcula-
tion of upper and lower bounds on its distance. But, because
this maser lies in the horizontal part of the Galactic rotation
curve, hereafter we use an average estimate of the heliocen-
tric distance r
σR. The
same distance estimates are used also for other masers.

σr or galactocentric distance R

We reduce line-of-sight velocities of masers with re-
spect to the LSR to the heliocentric coordinate system
using the standard Solar motion velocity: (α, δ)1900 =
(270◦, +30◦), V = 20 km s−1, hence (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR =
(10.3, 15.3, 7.7) km s−1 (Reid et al., 2009).

It is very important for the purposes of our study to
know the accurate value of R0. A review of R0 estimates
made by a number of authors can be found in the paper
by Avedisova (2005), where the average value is derived as
R0 = 7.80
0.33 kpc. Note that the most reliable values
of this parameter were obtained only recently. Analysis of

cations of the Sun and Galactic Centre (GC) are indicated. The

motion of the star S2 around the black hole in the Galactic
Centre gave R0 = 8.4
0.4 kpc (Ghez et al., 2008). This value
is in a good agreement with observations of orbits of 28 stars
0.33 kpc
near the Galactic Centre during 16 yr: R0 = 8.31
(Gillessen et al., 2009).

±

±

In general, modern estimations show that the most
probable value of R0 is close to 8.0 kpc, and error of its
determination is close to 0.3 kpc. For the sake of reliability,
we’ll consider that the value of R0 lies in the 7.5
8.5 kpc
range.

3.2 Determining Projections Vθ and VR

Components of spatial velocities U, V, W of masers are de-
termined from observed radial (line-of-sight) and tangential
velocities Vr, Vl, Vb in the following way:

W = Vr sin b + Vb cos b.

Then we ﬁnd two projections of these velocities: VR, directed
radially from the Galactic Centre towards an object, and Vθ,
orthogonal to VR and directed towards Galactic rotation:

3.3 Fourier Analysis of Velocities

At the next step, we consider deviations from circular veloc-
ities ∆Vθ and galactocentric radial velocities VR.

Spectral analysis consists in applying direct Fourier
transform to the sequence of residual velocities following
way:

V (λk) =

1
M

M

i
X

V i exp

j

2π
λk

Ri

,

(cid:19)

−

(cid:18)

(13)

where V (λk) is the k-th harmonic of Fourier transform, M
is the number of measurements of velocities V i with coordi-
nates Ri, i = 1, 2, . . . , M , and λk is wavelength in kpc; the
latter is equal to D/k, where D is the period of the origi-
nal sequence in kpc. In density wave theory, λ denotes the
distance between adjacent spiral arms along the Galactic
radius vector.

Understanding the results of spectral analysis is easy in
the framework of linear theory of density waves. According
to this approach (Burton & Bania, 1974; Byl & Ovenden,
1978),

VR =

fR cos χ,

∆Vθ = fθ sin χ,

(15)

where χ = m[cot(i) ln(R/R0)
θ] + χ⊙ is phase of the spiral

wave (m is number of spiral arms, i is pitch angle, χ⊙ is the
phase of the Sun in the spiral wave (Rohlfs, 1977)); fR and
fθ are amplitudes of radial and tangential components of
the perturbed velocities which, for convenience, are always
considered positive.

For the case when perturbations VR and ∆Vθ are
considered as periodic functions of logarithm of R, the
following expression for the phase is appropriate: χ =
(2πR0/λ) ln(R/R0) + χ⊙
R0) + χ⊙ (Mel’nik
et al, 2001), what allows us to use Fourier analysis (13).

4 RESULTS

4.1 Galactic Rotation Curve

Firstly we investigated solutions of equations (1)–(3) using
the diﬀerent number of Taylor expansion terms of Ω for
diﬀerent values of R0. Direct construction of the rotation
curve using the rotation parameters obtained above showed
that every additional expansion term leads to signiﬁcant
widening of the conﬁdence interval. We revealed that it is
enough to take three terms of Taylor expansion to construct
a smooth, suﬃciently accurate Galactic rotation curve in
the galactocentric distance range of 3 < R < 14 kpc. In-
deed, adding subsequent terms to the expansion practically
does not change the shape of the curve, and additional terms
do not diﬀer statistically from zero. So, in this sense we
found the optimal solution. Results of this study are shown
in Fig. 2, whence we can see that the shape of the rota-
tion curve signiﬁcantly depends on the adopted value of R0.
Thus, variation dR0 = 0.5 kpc leads to variation of the ro-
20 km s−1. As one can see
tational angular velocity dVθ
from Fig. 2, inﬂuence of inaccuracy in R0 is particularly
strong in the Solar neighborhood.

As one can see from Fig. 3a, errors in parameters (16)
lead to strongly increasing errors in the rotational angular
velocity Ω(R) when R > 10 kpc. Due to this the conﬁdence
interval for the linear rotation curve Vθ(R) (Fig. 3b) starts
to exceed the criterion adopted above, dVθ = 20 km s−1, at
R > 10 kpc. In general, we can conclude that the Galactic
rotation curve found above approximates our initial data
with fully adequate accuracy over the range of distances of
3 < R < 10 kpc.

curve was ﬁtted using a chi-square optimization technique.
As it is seen from the picture, the approximation curve is
not representative enough to make any conclusions.

with the main periodogram peak shown in Fig. 5b, which

tion curve built using this main low-frequency Fourier spec-
trum peak extending from λ = 3 kpc to λ = 1.5 kpc and
ﬁtted using the chi-square optimization, is shown in bold

As one may see from this ﬁgure, residual velocities of
most of masers form a suﬃciently compact ellipse of smaller
dispersion. Most of deviations from this compact distribu-
tion are due to the following three masers: G23.66
0.13,
G23.43
0.18 and NGC 1333 (f2). The detail NGC 1333 (f2)
reﬂects inner velocity dispersion within maser NGC 1333
which itself forms an expanding shell (Hirota et al., 2008a).
Maser G23.66
0.13 has signiﬁcantly negative radial velocity
which reﬂects a certain peculiarity in its motion.

The question of great interest is how density wave per-

the estimate of Solar motion by Sch¨onrich et al. (2010) and
Francis & Anderson (2009).

We could not determine the value of χ⊙ using deviations
from circular velocities of masers. But in order to conﬁrm our
results obtained above using Galactic radial velocities VR of
masers, we analyzed also a sample of Open Star Clusters
(OSCs) from the compilation of Bobylev et al. (2007) which
was based on the catalog of Piskunov et al. (2006), along
with the line-of-sight velocities from the CRVOCA catalog
(Kharchenko et al., 2007). We selected 117 young OSCs (age
< 50 Myr) in radius r < 2 kpc using the following restriction
for modulus of residual velocities: √∆U 2 + ∆V 2 + ∆W 2 <
50 km s−1.

Results of analysis of deviations from circular velocities
∆Vθ using Galactic rotation parameters (16) and galacto-
centric radial velocities VR are shown in Figs. 8a and 8b,
respectively. We can see a good agreement between the
approximation curves shown in panels (a) and (b): wave-
lengths are almost similar, diﬀerence in phase is about
π/2, peaks are also comparable (6-8 km s−1). Periodograms
of deviations from circular velocities and radial velocities
are shown in Fig. 9. To obtain approximation curves in
Fig. 8, we used low-frequency Fourier spectra up to wave-
lengths λ = 1.3 kpc and ﬁtted the amplitude of pertur-
bations using the chi-square optimization. Spectral anal-
ysis of VR (Fig. 9b) reveals periodic motion with wave-
length λ = 1.9(0.23R0) kpc. Spectral analysis of ∆Vθ
(Fig. 9a) displays three dominant peaks at wavelengths
λ = 2.21(0.28R0 ), 1.1(0.13R0), 0.47(0.058R0 ) kpc (compare
with results by Clemens (1985):λ = 0.22R0, 0.12R0, 0.05R0).
Now we can compare these results with those obtained
using radial velocities VR of masers. We can see a good agree-
ment in the behavior of the approximation curves shown
in Fig. 8b and Fig. 6 in the Solar area. Fourier spectrum
of radial velocities of masers VR reveals a dominant peak
of amplitude 6.5 km s−1 at wavelength 2 kpc. In addition,

5.2 Spiral Structure Parameters

The estimate λ = 0.22R0 of the distance between ad-
jacent spiral arms was obtained by Clemens (1985). For
R0 = 8.5 kpc used here it gives λ = 1.8 kpc which is in
a good agreement with the value λ = 2.0 kpc obtained in
our study using 28 selected masers, as well as with λ = 1.9
obtained from 117 young OSCs. Mel’nik et al. (2001) ob-
0.2 kpc by analyzing velocities
tained the estimate λ = 2.0
of OB associations in the 3-kpc Solar neighborhood. An in-
dependent estimate λ = 1.7

range of 6 < R < 9 kpc (Bobylev et al., 2008).

5.3 Peculiar Velocity of the Sun

It is worth mentioning some results of determination of the
non-perturbed LSR velocity parameters obtained simultane-
ously with parameters of the Galactic rotation, taking into
account perturbations evoked by the spiral wave density.
(2, 2) km s−1
For example, these are: (U⊙, V⊙)LSR = (2, 5)
(Mishurov et al., 1997); (U⊙, V⊙)LSR = (7.8, 13.6)
±
(1.3, 1.4) km s−1 (Mishurov & Zenina, 1999); (U⊙, V⊙)LSR =
(1, 1) km s−1 (L´epine et al., 2001). Let us men-
(9, 12)
tion also the results of Fern´andes et al. (2001), obtained
using diﬀerent samples of OB stars: (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR =
(0.7, 1.0, 0.5) km s−1 and of Cepheids:
(8.8, 12.4, 8.4)
(U⊙, V⊙, W⊙)LSR = (6.5, 10.4, 5.7)

Figure 9. Periodograms of deviations from (a) circular velocities
∆Vθ and (b) radial velocities VR for 117 young OSCs.

From the results listed here, we can see that values of
(U, V ) components of the LSR velocity are always smaller
than the corresponding components of the standard Solar
motion velocity (U⊙, V⊙, W⊙) = (10.3, 15.3, 7.7) km s−1.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Spatial velocities of all currently known 28 masers hav-
ing estimates of trigonometric parallaxes are reanalyzed.
To determine the Galactic rotation curve, we used the
ﬁrst three terms of Taylor expansion of the Galactic an-
gular rotational velocity at the galactocentric distance of
the Sun R0 = 8.0 kpc. Coeﬃcients obtained from Bot-
