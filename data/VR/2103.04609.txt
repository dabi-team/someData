ABSTRACT
Next-generation wireless communication technologies will allow
users to obtain unprecedented performance, paving the way to new
and immersive applications. A prominent application requiring
high data rates and low communication delay is Virtual Reality
(VR), whose presence will become increasingly stronger in the
years to come. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first
traffic model for VR applications based on traffic traces acquired
from a commercial VR streaming software, allowing the community
to further study and improve the technology to manage this type of
traffic. This work implements ns-3 applications able to generate and
process large bursts of packets, enabling the possibility of analyzing
APP-level end-to-end metrics, making the source code, as well as
the acquired VR traffic traces, publicly available and open-source.

1 INTRODUCTION
The growing demand for high-performance telecommunication net-
works is driving both industry and academia to push the boundaries
of the achievable performance.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) proposes re-
quirements for International Mobile Telecommunication-2020 (IMT-
2020) Enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) such as peak Downlink
(DL) data rate of 20 Gbps with 4 ms user plane latency [8], for ex-
ample by exploiting the large bandwidth available in the Millimeter
Wave (mmW) spectrum. Similarly, Wireless Local Area Networks

(WLANs) are also harvesting the potential of the mmW band with
a family of standards known as Wireless Gigabit (WiGig), including
IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ay. While the former, first standardized in
2012 [7] and later revised in 2016 [6], is able to reach bit rates up to
8 Gbps, the latter is close to being officially standardized [14] and
promises bit rates up to 100 Gbps.

These specifications for wireless systems enable a new gener-
ation of demanding applications such as high-definition wireless
monitor, eXtended Reality (XR) headsets and other high-end wear-
ables, data center inter-rack connectivity, wireless backhauling, and
office docking, among others [15].

In particular, XR, an umbrella name including technologies such
as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), has been tar-
geted as a key application with growing interest in the consumer
market [5]. Compact and portable devices with limited battery
and computing power should be enabled to wirelessly support this
type of demanding applications, to provide a fully immersive and
realistic user experience.

To reach the limits of human vision, monitors with a resolution
of 5073×5707 per eye with 120 FPS refresh rate will be needed [5].
These specifications suggest that rendering might be offloaded
to a separate server as head-mounted displays should be light,
silent, and comfortable enough to be worn for long periods of
time. This poses a significant strain on the wireless connection,
requiring ∼167 Gbps of uncompressed video stream. Clearly, real-
time 360 video compression techniques allow to largely reduce these
throughput requirements down to the order of 100–1000 Mbps, at
the cost of some processing delay.

While throughput requirements are already very demanding, low
latencies are the key to the success or the failure of XR applications.
In fact, many studies showed that users tend to experience what is
called motion or cyber sickness when their actions do not correspond
to rapid reactions in the virtual world, causing disorientation and
dizziness [3–5, 9, 11]. Motion-to-photon latency is thus required
to be at most 20 ms, translating into a network latency for video
frames of 5–9 ms [5, 15].

In its simplest and most ideal form, raw XR traffic with a fixed
frame rate 𝐹 could be modeled by periodic traffic, with period 1/𝐹
and constant frame size 𝑆 proportional to the display resolution.
Real traffic, though, is first of all compressed with one of the many
existing video codecs, and then properly optimized for real-time
low-latency streaming, resulting in encoded video frames of vari-
able size. Furthermore, the complexity of a given scene can also
affect the time required to render it as well as the obtainable com-
pression factor. Together, these factors make both the video frame

 
 
 
 
 
 
size and the period random, possibly correlated both in time and in
the frame-size/period domains.

Given the interest of both industry and consumers in XR appli-
cations and the peculiarity of the generated traffic, networks and
networking protocols might be optimized to better support this type
of traffic, ensuring its strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.
To the best of our knowledge, no prior work on XR traffic mod-
eling exists. Cloud gaming [1] was identified as a closely related
problem, where a remote server renders and streams a video to
a client with limited computational resources, which only feeds
basic information to the rendering servers, such as keys pressed
and mouse movements. The main difference with the problem un-
der analysis is given by the more restrictive QoS constraints of XR
applications, mainly due to the limits imposed by motion sickness.
Furthermore, in cloud gaming, client and server are often in differ-
ent WLANs, making it harder to obtain reliable measurements of
packet generation times. In fact, due to the specific constraints and
requirements of XR applications, we expect the rendering server to
be in a local network rather than being remotely accessed via the
Internet.

Most works in the literature focus on network performance and
limitations of cloud gaming [16], and we could find only two main
contributions addressing traffic analysis and modeling. The authors
of [2] provide a simple traffic analysis for three different games
played on OnLive, a cloud gaming application that was shut down in
2015. The analysis focuses on packet-level statistics, such as packet
size, inter-packet time, and bit rate. They measured the performance
of the streaming service under speed-limited networks, showing
an evident frame rate variability. In [12], the authors tried to model
the traffic generated by two games, also played on the OnLive
platform. In particular, they recognized that video frames were split
into multiple fragments, and re-aggregated them before studying
their statistics. A number of DL and Uplink (UL) data flows were
recognized, and characterized in terms of application packet data
unit size and packet inter arrival time. Unfortunately, correlation
among successive video frames was not modeled and the analysis
referred to a single game played with an average data rate of about
5 Mbps.

The novelty of this paper can be summarized as follows:

(1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative
model for APP-level XR traffic based on over 90 minutes of
acquired and processed VR traffic, with adaptable data rate
and frame rate;

(2) we provide a flexible Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) module for
simulating applications with bursty behavior able to charac-
terize both fragment-level and burst-level performance;
(3) we provide an implementation of the proposed XR traffic
model, as well as a trace-based model, on the bursty applica-
tion framework;

(4) as a side contribution, several acquired VR traffic traces are
made available, allowing researchers to (i) use real VR traffic
in their simulations and (ii) further analyze and improve VR
traffic models.

In the remainder of this work, we will describe the traffic acqui-
sition and analysis in Section 2, propose a flexible XR traffic model
in Section 3, discuss about the ns-3 implementation of the bursty

application framework in Section 4, validate the model and show a
possible use case in Section 5, and finally draw the conclusions of
this work and propose future works in Section 6.

2 VR TRAFFIC: ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS
The traffic model that will be described in Section 3 is based on a
set of acquisitions of VR traffic. In the remainder of this section,
the acquisition setup and the statistical analysis of the acquired VR
traffic traces will be presented.

2.1 Acquisition Setup
The setup comprises a desktop PC (equipped with an i7 processor,
32 GB of RAM, and an nVidia GTX 2080Ti graphics card) acting as a
rendering server, and transmitting the information to a smartphone
acting as a passive VR headset. The two nodes are connected via
USB tethering to avoid random interference from other surrounding
devices and the less stable wireless channel.

To stream the VR traffic, the rendering server runs the appli-
cation RiftCat 2.0, connected to the VRidge app running on the
smartphone.1 This setup allows the user to play VR games on the
SteamVR platform for up to 10 minutes, enough to obtain multiple
traffic traces that can be analyzed later. The application allows for
a number of settings, most notably (i) the display resolution and
scan format (kept fixed at the smartphone’s native resolution, i.e.,
1920×1080p), (ii) the frame rate, allowing the user to choose be-
tween 30 FPS and 60 FPS, and (iii) the target data rate (i.e., the data
rate the application will try to consistently stream to the client)
which can be set from 1 to 50 Mbps.

To simplify the analysis of the traffic stream in this first work,
no VR games were played, acquiring only traces from the SteamVR
waiting room with no audio. The waiting room is still rendered
and streamed in real time, thus allowing the capture of an actual
VR stream. Furthermore, in order for SteamVR to fully start and
load the waiting room, traces were trimmed down to approximately
550 s each.

We noticed that the encoder used to stream the video from the
rendering server to the phone was able to reduce the stream size
when the scene was fairly static, thus preventing us from reaching
data rates higher than 20 Mbps with the phone in a fixed position.
Small movements from the phone were sufficient to obtain a data
rate close to the target one.

Traffic traces were obtained using Wireshark, a popular open-
source packet analyzer, running on the rendering server and sniffing
the tethered USB connection. The traffic analysis was performed at
30 and 60 FPS for target data rates of {10, 20, 30, 40, 50} Mbps, for a
total of over 90 minutes of analyzed VR traffic.

2.2 Traffic Analysis
By analyzing the sniffed packet traces, we discovered that VRidge
uses UDP sockets over IPv4 and that the UL stream contains several
types of packets, such as synchronization, video frame reception
information, and frequent small head-tracking information pack-
ets. In DL, instead, we found synchronization, acknowledgment,

and video frame packets bursts. We also found out that the ap-
plication stream is based on ENet, a simple and robust network
communication layer on top of UDP.

Video traffic is, as expected, the main source of data transmission
(Figure 1a). Video frames are easily categorized by their transmis-
sion pattern: a single frame is fragmented into multiple smaller
1278 B packets sent back-to-back. By reverse-engineering the bits
composing the UDP payload, it was possible to identify 5 ranges of
information in what appears to be a 31 B APP-layer header, specifi-
cally (i) the frame sequence number, (ii) the number of fragments
composing the frame, (iii) the fragment sequence number, (iv) the
total frame size, and (v) a checksum. Thanks to this, we were able
to reliably gather information on video frames, allowing for robust
data processing.

Figure 1b shows that UL traffic only accounts for 110 kbps for
30 FPS acquisitions and 120 kbps for 60 FPS acquisitions, while
non-video DL traffic is only about 2.5 kbps for 30 FPS acquisition
and 5 kbps for 60 FPS acquisitions, regardless of the target data rate,
and for this reason, they were ignored in the proposed analysis.

It follows that, considering 𝑅 the target data rate and 𝐹 the
application frame rate, the average video frame size is expected to
be close to the ideal 𝑆 = 𝑅/𝐹 , as shown in Figure 1c. Note that the
𝑥-axis reports the empirical data rate rather than the target data
rate, i.e., the average data rate estimated from the acquired traces,
which differ slightly as shown in Figure 1a.

Furthermore, Figure 1d shows that the average Inter-Frame Inter-

arrival (IFI) perfectly matches the expected 1/𝐹 .

Usually, when compressing a video, both intra-frame and inter-
frame compression techniques are exploited. Specifically, Intra-
coded frames (I-frames) use compression techniques similar to
those of a simple static picture. Instead, Predictive-coded frames
(P-frames) exploit the temporal correlation of successive frames to
greatly reduce the compressed frame size. Similarly, Bipredictive-
coded frames (B-frames) exploit the knowledge from subsequent
frames as well, other than previous frames, to further improve the
compression efficiency at the cost of non-real-time transmission.
Video compression standards such as H.264 [13] define the pat-
tern of compressed frame types between two consecutive I-frames,
which is commonly referred to as Group of Pictures (GoP).

The traffic traces show that GoPs are not deterministic, and tend
to be larger at lower target data rates, likely to take advantage of the
higher compression generally provided by P-frames. Furthermore,
lower target data rates may introduce a small delay to also encode
the more efficient B-frames, thus improving the visual quality while
decreasing the overall responsiveness. However, the strategy used
by the application to map the specified target rate into a certain
GoP format is proprietary and undisclosed, so that we could only
observe some general trends.

3 TRAFFIC MODEL
In this section, we will describe how we model frame sizes and
inter-frame periodicity, leaving the model validation to Section 5.

3.1 Modeling Frame Periodicity
To fully characterize and thus generate a realistic frame period,
more information is needed such as (i) the distribution of the frame
period, (ii) the parameters of this distribution, (iii) the correlation
between successive frame periods, and (iv) the correlation between
the current frame size and the frame period.

To simplify the model, in this first analysis we assume the cur-
rent frame size and the frame period to be independent, and we
consider the stochastic process representing the frame period to be
uncorrelated. We thus focus only on the distribution of the frame
period.

Among all measurements taken at both 30 and 60 FPS, the lo-
gistic distribution was often the best-fitting one, among all of the
tested distributions. For this reason, we choose to model the frame
periods as independent and identically Logistic-distributed random
variables 𝑋 ∼ Logistic(𝜇, 𝑠) with Probability Density Function
(PDF)

𝑝 (𝑥 |𝜇, 𝑠) =

𝑒−(𝑥−𝜇)/𝑠
𝑠 (1 + 𝑒−(𝑥−𝜇)/𝑠 )2

,

.

where 𝜇 is the location parameter, 𝑠 > 0 is the scale parameter, and
E[𝑋 ] = 𝜇, std(𝑋 ) = 𝑠𝜋
√
3

Given the great accordance between the expected frame period
and the empirical one (shown in Figure 1d), we can easily set E[𝑋 ] =
𝜇 = 1
𝐹 . Instead, to model the standard deviation of the proposed
Logistic random variables, we need to further process the acquired

data, although for a powerful enough rendering server we expect
the standard deviation to also be inversely proportional to the frame
rate.

Figure 2a shows the average standard deviation of the acquired
traces at both 30 and 60 FPS. We notice that the average standard de-
viation at 30 FPS is 2.7855 ms, while at 60 FPS it is equal to 1.3646 ms,
with a perfect ratio of 2.04. This suggests that our rendering server
is powerful enough to reliably handle streams at both frame rates
since the standard deviation of the IFI nearly doubles as the frame
rate halves, as expected.

While the data is not enough for a robust generalization, it does
suggest that a higher frame rate 𝐹 yields lower IFI standard devia-
tion 𝑑, keeping a roughly constant ratio with the average IFI, with
an inverse law: 𝑑 = 𝑐
𝐹 . Assuming that this inverse law holds, we
compute the average 𝑐 obtained by the sets of acquisitions at 30 and
60 FPS, equal to 𝑐 = 0.0827.

3.2 Modeling Frame Size
Following the discussion in Section 2.2, we propose to model the
frame size distribution of the video frame with a Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM), i.e., 𝑉 (𝑆) ∼ 𝐺𝑀𝑀 (𝝁 (𝑆), 𝝈 2 (𝑆)), with PDF

𝑉 (𝑆) = 𝜒𝐼 (𝑆)𝑉𝐼 (𝑆) + (1 − 𝜒𝐼 (𝑆))𝑉𝑃 (𝑆),
where 𝜒𝐼 (𝑆) is the indicator function for I-frames which takes the
value of 1 with probability 𝑤𝐼 (𝑆) and 0 otherwise, and 𝑉𝑓 (𝑆) ∼
(cid:17), 𝑓 ∈ {𝐼, 𝑃 }. Clearly, the fitted normal variable

𝜇𝑓 (𝑆), 𝜎 2

(cid:16)

𝑓 (𝑆)

with the lower mean will be associated to P-frames while the one
with the higher mean will be associated to I-frames.

To generalize the model, the parameters of the GMM should be

extended to arbitrary target data rates.

Starting from the GMMs of the acquired traffic traces, the mean
frame sizes of I- and P-frames are generalized by fitting linear
models, while their standard deviations are better fitted by a power
law, both as a function of the expected average frame size 𝑆. Since
a target data rate approaching zero would require video frames to
also approach zero, we force the linear fit to have no intercept, i.e.,
𝜇𝐼 (𝑆) = 𝑠𝐼 𝑆, 𝜇𝑃 (𝑆) = 𝑠𝑃 𝑆, 𝜎𝐼 (𝑆) = 𝑎𝐼 𝑆𝑏𝐼 , and 𝜎𝑃 (𝑆) = 𝑎𝑃 𝑆𝑏𝑃 as
depicted with dashed lines in Figures 2b and 2c.

By setting E[𝑉 (𝑆)] equal to 𝑆 we get

(cid:40)E[𝑉 (𝑆)] = 𝑤𝐼 (𝑆)𝜇𝐼 (𝑆) + 𝑤𝑃 (𝑆)𝜇𝑃 (𝑆) = 𝑆
𝑤𝐼 + 𝑤𝑃 = 1

,

from which 𝑤𝐼 (𝑆) = 𝑤𝐼 = 1−𝑠𝑃
, regard-
𝑠𝐼 −𝑠𝑃
less of 𝑆. Setting 0 ≤ 𝑤𝐼 , 𝑤𝑃 ≤ 1 results in a requirement for 𝑠𝐼 and
𝑠𝑃 , specifically, 𝑠𝑃 ≤ 1 ≤ 𝑠𝐼 .

and 𝑤𝑃 (𝑆) = 𝑤𝑃 =

𝑠𝐼 −1
𝑠𝐼 −𝑠𝑃

To make the model more robust, we first fit the GMM 50 times
with random initial conditions and pick the best-fitting model, and
then weigh the linear fit of the parameters proportionally to the
goodness of the GMM fit.

To improve the reliability of our model, when fitting the GMM
means and standard deviations we use the empirical data rate as the
independent variable instead of the target data rate since the two
differ slightly as noticed in Section 2.2. In fact, we aim at modeling
the general behavior of the application while trying to generate the
amount of traffic requested by the user as closely as possible.

Figure 2b shows that the means of the GMMs are fitted well
by a linear model in the 𝑆 domain, which is used to simultane-
ously process the data of the acquisitions obtained both at 30 and
60 FPS, yielding the fitter parameters 𝑠𝐼 = 1.1764 and 𝑠𝑃 = 0.9008.
The fitted slopes result in 𝑤𝑃 = 0.64, which fits well the 30 FPS
acquisitions, with slightly worse performance at 60 FPS.

On the other hand, the GMMs standard deviations show a more
noisy fit (Figure 2c), yielding parameters 𝑎𝐼 = 26.2065, 𝑏𝐼 = 0.5730,
𝑎𝑃 = 9.0399, and 𝑏𝑃 = 0.6251. This suggests an approximate
square-root relationship between the average frame size 𝑆 and the
standard deviation of the GMMs. The logarithmic plot helps the
visualization by transforming a power law into a simple linear
relationship.

Frame sizes are independently drawn from the mixture model
instead of simulating a GoP, since different GoPs were found for
different target data rates, and always with a non-deterministic
nature.

4 NS-3 IMPLEMENTATION
To properly model and test the performance of VR traffic over
a simulated network, a flexible application framework has been
implemented in ns-3 and made publicly available [10]. The frame-
work is based on the ns-3.33 release and aims at providing a novel
additional traffic model, easily customizable by the final user.

The proposed framework allows the user to send packet bursts
fragmented into multiple packets by BurstyApplication, later
re-aggregated at the receiver, if possible, by BurstSink. Since the

generation of packet bursts is crucial to model a wide range of
possibilities, a generic BurstGenerator interface has been de-
fined. Users can implement arbitrary generators by extending this
interface, and three examples have been provided and will be de-
scribed in Section 4.2. Finally, each fragment comprises a novel
SeqTsSizeFragHeader, which includes information on both the
fragment and the current burst, allowing BurstSink to correctly
re-aggregate or discard a burst, yielding information on received
fragments, received bursts, and failed bursts.

More details on the implementation and the rationale behind

these applications will be given in the following sections.

4.1 Bursty Application
Inspired by the acquired traffic traces described in Section 2.1,
BurstyApplication periodically sends bursts of data divided into
multiple smaller fragments of (at most) a given size. Since burst
size and period statistics can be quite general, the generation of
the burst statistics is delegated to objects extending the Burst-
Generator interface, later described in Section 4.2. BurstyHelper
is also implemented to simplify the generation and installation of
BurstyApplications with given BurstGenerators to network
nodes and examples are provided.

Each fragment carries a SeqTsSizeFragHeader, an extension
of SeqTsSizeHeader which adds the information on the fragment
sequence number and the total number of fragments composing the
burst, on top of the (burst) sequence number and size as well as the
transmission time-stamp. After setting a desired FragmentSize in
bytes, the application will compute how many fragments will be
generated to send the full burst to the target receiver, although the
last two fragments may be smaller due to the size of the burst not
being a multiple of the fragment size, and the presence of the extra
header.

Traces notify the user when fragments and bursts are sent, while
also keeping track of the number of bursts, fragments, and bytes
sent, making it easier to quickly compute some simple high-level
metrics directly from the main script of the simulation.

4.2 Burst Generator Interface
A generic bursty application can show extremely different behav-
iors. For example, an application could send a given amount of
data periodically in a deterministic fashion, or the burst size or
the period could be random with arbitrary statistics, successive
bursts could be correlated (e.g., the concept of GoP for video-coding
standards such as H.264 [13]), and even the burst size and the time
before the next burst might be correlated.

To accommodate for the widest range of possibilities, a Burst-
Generator interface has been defined. Classes extending this in-
terface must define two pure virtual functions:

(1) HasNextBurst: to ensure that the burst generator is able to
generate a new burst size and the time before the next burst
(also called next period in the remainder of this paper);
(2) GenerateBurst: yielding the burst size of the current burst

as well as the next period, if it exists.

Three classes extending this interface are proposed and briefly
discussed in the remainder of this section, allowing users to gen-
erate very diverse statistics without the need to implement their
own custom generator in most cases.

Simple Burst Generator. Inspired from OnOffApplication, Sim-
pleBurstGenerator defines the current burst size and the next
period as generic RandomVariableStreams. Users are thus able to
model arbitrary burst size and next period distributions, by: using
the distributions already implemented in ns-3; implementing more
distributions; or simply defining arbitrary Cumulative Distribution
Functions (CDFs) for EmpiricalRandomVariables.

Limitations for this generator lie in the correlation of the gener-
ated random variables: burst size and next period are independently
drawn as are successive bursts.

VR Burst Generator. VrBurstGenerator is a direct implementa-
tion of the model proposed in Section 3, where bursts model video
frames.

Similar to the RiftCat software described in Section 2.1, this
generator makes it possible to choose a target data rate and a frame
rate.

While traces were taken at specific frame rates and target data
rates, the proposed model attempts to generalize them, although
without any knowledge on the quality of the generalization beyond
the boundaries imposed by the streaming software.

To generate the frame size and the next period, Logistic-
RandomVariable and MixtureRandomVariable have been im-
plemented in ns-3.

A validation of the proposed model based on this burst generator

will be discussed in Section 5.

Trace File Burst Generator. Finally, users might want to repro-
duce in ns-3 a traffic trace obtained by a real application, gener-
ated by a separate traffic generator, or even manually written by a
user (e.g., for static debugging/testing purposes). For these reasons,
TraceFileBurstGenerator was introduced, taking advantage of
CsvReader to parse a csv-like file declaring a (burst size, next pe-
riod) pair for each row. Once traces are imported, the generator
will sequentially yield every burst, returning false as output to
TraceFileBurstGenerator::HasNextBurst after the last row
of the trace file is yielded, thus stopping the BurstyApplication.
A StartTime can be set as an attribute, allowing the user to
control which part of the file trace will be used in the simulation.
This can be especially useful when the total simulation duration is
shorter than the traffic trace, making it possible to decouple users
by setting different start times.

Several VR traffic traces using different frame rates and target
data rates are available [10] in the described format for a total of over
90 minutes of processed acquisitions, comprising some relevant
metadata as part of the commented header. Interested readers can
thus simulate real VR video traffic in their ns-3 simulations, or
expand the analysis performed in Sections 2.2 and 3.

4.3 Burst Sink
An adaptation of the existing PacketSink, called BurstSink, is
proposed for the developed bursty framework. This new applica-
tion expects to receive packets from users equipped with Bursty-
Applications and tries to re-aggregate fragments into packets.
While the current version of PacketSink is able to assemble
byte streams with SeqTsSizeHeader, there are two reasons why
BurstSink was created, specifically (i) to stress the dependence
of this framework on UDP rather than TCP sockets, as the acquisi-
tions suggested, thus expecting individual fragments sent unreliably
rather than a reliable byte stream, and (ii) to trace the reception at
both the fragment and the burst level.

The application implements a simple best-effort aggregation
algorithm, assuming that (i) the burst transmission duration is
much shorter than the next period, and (ii) all fragments are needed
to re-aggregate a burst. Specifically, fragments of a given burst are
collected, even if unordered, and, if all fragments are received, the
burst is successfully received. If, instead, fragments of subsequent
bursts are received before all fragments of the previous one, then
the previous burst is discarded. Information on the current fragment
and burst can easily be recovered from SeqTsSizeFragHeader,
allowing the application to verify whether a burst has been fully
received or not. If needed and suggested by real-world applications,
future works might also introduce the concept of APP-level Forward
Error Correction (FEC).

Traces notify the user when fragments are received and when
bursts are successfully received or discarded, together with all the
related relevant information. Furthermore, similarly to the Bursty-
Application, also the BurstSink application keeps track of the
number of bursts, fragments, and bytes received.

5 MODEL VALIDATION AND POSSIBLE USE

CASES

This section will present a comparison between the acquired VR
traces and the proposed model, as well as an example use case.

For both the comparison and the example, we show the results
of full-stack simulations highlighting the importance of accurately
modeling a traffic source by using (i) the proposed model and (ii)
the acquired traffic traces. For full-stack simulations we consider a
simple Wi-Fi network based on IEEE 802.11ac, sending data over a
single stream and using MCS 9 over a 160 MHz channel.

5.1 Model Validation
A comparison between the modeled distributions and the acquired
traffic traces is shown in Figures 3 and 4.

In particular, as expected from Figure 2a, the IFI standard devia-
tion is a loose fit, and thus CDFs shown in Figure 3 show a fairly
large deviation between the model and two examples of acquired
traces, namely the highest and lowest target data rates acquired for
both available frame rates. This is to be expected given the large
variance of the acquired data, although the objective of our model
is to generalize the behavior of a real application for both data rates
and frame rates, making it extremely hard to represent well the
acquired data.

Figure 4 shows the CDFs for frame sizes at different frame rate
and target data rate. The 30 FPS data is overall fitted well by the

proposed model, and two examples at different target data rates
are shown. On the other hand, the 60 FPS data shows a different
behavior with respect to the model. A first explanation is that the
60 FPS traces always have a higher empirical data rate than the
target one, so the red dashed lines are generally to the right of
the blue lines. Furthermore, doubling the frame rate at a constant

data rate halves the average video frame size, making it necessary
to use more sophisticated encoding techniques to still be able to
obtain a good enough video quality by biasing the relative size and
frequency of I- and P-frames. Still, our model is able to capture the
overall distributions, making it possible to generate novel traffic
data with parameters that were never acquired.

End-to-end results in Figure 5 show good accordance between
models and empirical data, except for the 95th percentile of the
delay. In fact, the proposed model shown in blue shows good accor-
dance with the traffic traces, suggesting that it is able to emulate
sufficiently well the traffic statistics to obtain similar full-stack
results.

It is also important to notice the difference between fragment-
wise and burst-wise statistics. For applications such as VR, where
the whole burst needs to be received to acquire the desired informa-
tion, it is crucial to measure burst-level performance to get a deeper
understanding of the system performance. In general, fragment-
level metrics will be more optimistic than those at the burst level,
which may lead to incorrect conclusions.

5.2 Examples of Use Cases
To exemplify the uses of the proposed model, we discuss a possi-
ble scenario of interest where we test how well an IEEE 802.11ac
network can support intense VR traffic, for example in a VR arena.
In Figure 6, we show the simulation results for a scenario with
multiple users running VR applications with a target rate of 50 Mbps
in a Wi-Fi network. We compare the acquired trace file, where
Stations (STAs) import and generate disjoint parts of the trace file,
with the proposed model, both at 30 and 60 FPS.

Notice that the fixed target data rate of 𝑅 =50 Mbps, average
video frame size 𝑆 and frame rate 𝐹 will have the same ratio resulting
in double the frame size for 30 FPS streams with respect to 60 FPS.
For a network with fixed channel capacity, this translates to a delay
which will also double assuming that processing, queuing, and
other delays independent of the burst size are negligible, hence
explaining the different delay performance of the two frame rates
in Figure 6.

From Figure 6a, it is possible to see that the average burst delay is
below the maximum tolerable delay of 5-9 ms specified in [5] for up
to 8 users at both 30 and 60 FPS, although the delays of the 30 FPS
streams are higher than those of the 60 FPS streams, as expected.
Instead, if a good overall quality of experience should be granted,
the same bound for the 95th percentile of the delay would only
allow up to 5 users in the system for 30 FPS streams, or 7 users for

60 FPS streams, as shown in Figure 6b, thus greatly reducing the
arena capacity for increased reliability and overall user experience.

6 CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented a simple VR traffic model based on over
90 minutes of acquired traffic traces. While being simple, ignoring
second-order statistics, and being based on an ideal setting, this
model marks a starting point for network analysis and optimization
tailored for this novel and peculiar type of traffic, introducing a
more realistic traffic model into ns-3.

The proposed ns-3 framework for bursty applications is publicly
available and open source [10], together with the implementation
of the proposed traffic model and the actual traffic traces experi-
mentally obtained. We also attempted to generalize the model to
arbitrary target data rates and frame rates, allowing users to ex-
periment with arbitrary application-level settings that suit their
specific research.

The model has been built upon a framework to simulate bursty
applications in ns-3, where burst size and period can be customized
with little additional code, and traces for burst-level metrics col-
lections allow the user to better analyze a complex application
QoS.

Future works will focus on improving the quality and generality
of this approach. For example, second-order statistics will be taken
into account, trying to better characterize the statistics of GoPs.
More acquisitions will be taken, possibly longer, with different
streaming and video encoding settings, on several VR applications.
Finally, more complex settings will be considered, e.g., adding head
movements, in order to analyze possible correlations between them
and the generated traffic.
