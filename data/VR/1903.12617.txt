Some Experimental Results of Relieving Discomfort in Virtual 

Reality by Disturbing Feedback Loop in Human Brain 

Wei Qionghua1    Wang Hui2    Wei Qiang3 

Abstract 

Recently, great progress has been made in virtual reality(VR) research and application. However, virtual 

reality  faces  a  big  problem  since  its  appearance,  i.e.  discomfort  (nausea,  stomach  awareness,  etc). 

Discomfort can be relieved by increasing hardware (sensor, cpu and display) speed. But this will increase 

cost. This paper gives another low cost solution. The phenomenon of cybersickness is explained with the 

control  theory:  discomfort  arises  if  feedback  scene  differs  from  expectation,  so  it  can  be  relieved  by 

disturbing feedback loop in human brain. A hardware platform is build to test this explanation. The VR 

display  on  a  Samsung  S6  is  blurred  while  head  movement  is  detected.  The  effect  is  evaluated  by 

comparing responses to the Simulated Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) between a control and experimental 

condition. Experimental results show that the new method can ease discomfort remarkably with little 

extra cost. As a result, VR may be used more widely in teaching (like foreign language, medicine). It's 

also reasonable to expect likewise merits in other VR applications.

1 Introduction 

1Virtual reality has made great progress recently. 

Many  kinds  of 

implementations  appeared. 

Among them, Head Mounted Display (HMD) is 

an  important  device.  Users  can  get  satisfactory 

3D  immersion  by  using  HMD.  However,  many 

users  have  reported  discomfort  due  to  the 

prolonged  use  of  HMD.  This  discomfort  may 

lead to stronger effects, such as nausea, eyestrain, 

headache, and vertigo(Kennedy et al. 1993). It is 

crucial to ensure that the VR application does not 

drop  frames  or  produces  delays.  It's  possible  to 

reduce latency by increasing sensor/display speed, 

but this lead to higher cost. Consequently, many 

scholars try to solve the problem by other means.

For  example,  Kijima  and  Ojika  try  to  reduce 

tracking latency by sampling the orientation and 

position  as  late  in  the  rendering  process  as 

possible  (Kijima  and  Ojika  2002).  This  allows 

the rendering of visible image to be based on very 

up-to  date  tracking  information,  but  has  limited 

quality as only basic adjustments may be made so 

late in the rendering process. David J. Zielinski et 

al. try to  mitigate  the effects  of low frame rates 

(Zielinski et. al. 2015). In their technique, the low 

frame rate simulation images are displayed with 

low  persistence  by  blanking  out  the  display 

during  the  extra  time  such  image  would  be 

displayed.  Although  helpful  for  low  frame  rate, 

adding  black  frames  may  lead  to  eyestrain. 

Xingyao Yu et al. try to reduce simulator sickness 

caused  by  the  low  refresh  rate  of  display  in 

smartphone-based  VR  system  by  adding  static 

symbol(cross or Minion logo) on the screen of the 

smartphone  (Yu  et  al.  2016). But adding symbol 

introduce  extra  disturbance.  This  may  be 

undesirable 

for 

teaching.  Moreover,

The  collective  set  of  symptoms  associated  with

2005) .   

al.  2005)  or  Visually  Induced  Motion  Sickness 

(Howarth  and  Hodder  2008).  This  kind  of 

cybersickness  cannot  be  relieved  by  previous 

approaches. 

This paper tries to explain discomfort caused 

by  VR  environment  with  control  theory,  i.e. 

discomfort  will  happen 

if  feedback  (scene 

perceived by eye) differs from expectation when 

head  rotates.  Consequently,  blurring  display 

(disturbing feedback loop) may relieve this kind 

of  discomfort  (Wei  et  al.  2017).  In  fact,  this 

explanation  can  also  explain  some  interesting 

phenomenon  observed,  i.e.  researchers  have 

found that stroboscopic glasses (at the 8Hz level) 

are  effective  in  reducing  nausea  (Reschke, 

Somers  and  Ford  2006).  It's  also  interesting  to 

point out that Yu et  al. think blurring display can 

cause discomfort more quickly  (Yu  et  al.  2016), 
which is contrary to our results. The reason lies 

that  they  did  not  know  the  relation  between 

discomfort and feedback error, so they didn't blur 

image on correct time. 

In our research, a set of hardware is designed 

to test the new theory(explanation). Experiments 

are carried out to evaluate  the effect of the  new 

strategy. A standard questionnaire, the Simulator 

Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) is used to quantify 

simulator sickness symptoms. SSQ is used since 

other 

studies  have 

attempted 

to 

relate 

characteristic  changes  in  the  physiology  of 

cybersickness  with  user  responses  on  the  SSQ, 

finding 

strong  correlations  between 

some 

self-report  and  physiological  measures,  so  SSQ 

2 The view of control loop 

Many  factors  can  cause  discomfort  in  VR 

environment.  Among 

them, 

latency 

and 

simulation  motion  are  two  main  causes  that  are 

difficult to deal with. But the discomfort caused 

by these two factors can be explained in a view of 

control  theory.  Fig.1  is  the  structure  of  general 

control  system,  which  includes  sensor,  main 

processor,  actuator,  object  to  be  controlled.  The 

principle of the system is very simple: the sensor 

measures a quantity of the object to be controlled, 

the processor compare the quantity with a desired 

value. The processor then calculates an order and 

sent  it to the  actuator. This  way, the  quantity of 

the object is kept on a desired value. 

The  perception  and  action  of  human  being 

also conform to this pattern. For a human being, 

the  brain  is  the  processor,  the  muscle  that  can 

move the head is actuator, the head is the object to 

be controlled, and the eyes are sensor. Generally 

speaking, if the brain wants to change view, it will 

give order to muscles to rotate the head (or move 

the eye). At last, the scenes eye perceived should 

be  the  same  as  desired.  Moreover,  the  scene 

perceived  should  coincide  with 

the  scene 

expected  during  the  process  of  head  rotating. 

Discomfort may occur if those two scenes differ 

from each other.

loop in human brain, discomfort and cybersickness 

can  be  relieved  in  VR  environment.  This  is 

practical  especially  in  VR  teaching  and  training. 

For example, teacher talks with students in a fixed 

site when VR is used as background for language 

teaching.  There's  no  need  for  fast  movement  or 

quick  action/response 

then.  At  that 

time,  a 

technique  in  film  industry  can  be  used,  i.e.  The 

viewpoint  can  jump  from  one  point/direction  to 

another (even though it remains first person point 

of  view).  The  continuous 

transition  can  be 

removed by VR devices.  In this way, the relation 

between feedback error and cybersickness  can be 

broken and discomfort can be avoided. 

However, 

there's  a  shortcoming  to  this 

technique. When human beings are watching films, 

they are in a totally passive mode. The viewpoints 

are  determined  by  director  only.  While  in  VR 

environment, 

a  user  wants 

to  determine 

viewpoint/direction  himself.  Disturbing  feedback 

loop  will  interfere  with  his  will.  So  the  feedback 

loop should be kept partially. As a result, the scene 

in  user's  eyes  should  be  blurred  only  when  his 

head/eyes moving. The scene should change with 

his  movement,  so  that  the  user  can  stop  the 

movement  when 

the  scene  agrees  with  his 

expectation. 

Note  that,  quickness  is  also  needed  in  this 

3 Hardware and experiment design 

3.1 Hardware 
Fig.2 is the structure of the hardware platform used 

in  our  research.  The  core  of  the  platform  is  a 

STM32F4  processor.  The  motion  detector  is  a 

MPU6050 gyroscope, which is spliced on a side of 

a VR glasses. It is used to detect motion of user's 

head. The STM32F4 processor communicates with 

MPU6050 by means of IIC protocol at the speed of 
200 kHz clock frequency. The processor requests 
and gets angular speed data from gyroscope every 

1ms.  The  processor  will  generate  pulse  and  send 

pulse  to  four  MOSFET  (H-bridge)  to  generate 

1kHz 80Vp-p square wave if all angular speed data 

in  x-y-z  direction  is  smaller  than  6.1

.  The 

output  of  the  H-bridge  is  connected  to  liquid 

crystal sheet placed between VR glass lens and a 

smartphone (a Samsung S6). As a result, the liquid 

crystal  becomes  transparent.  On  the  contrary,  if 

angular  speed  in  any  direction  is  bigger  than 

6.1

,    the  processor  stops  generating  square 

wave,  the  liquid  crystal  will  change  to  blurred 

mode at that time(transparency less than 10%).

results 

and 

analysis 

4.1 Experimental results 
The  results  of  the  responses  to  the  SSQ  in  both 

the  experimental  and  control  conditions  were 

analyzed  using  the  parametric  matched  samples 

t-test. The results for the Matched Samples t-test 

can  be  viewed  in  Table  2.  Significant  decreases 

between 

the  experimental  and 

the  control 

conditions were revealed for general discomfort, 

eyestrain,  nausea, stomach awareness  and  dizzy 

(eyes open). 

4.2 Analysis on some phenomena 

a) According to section III.B, the principle of the 

platform  was  explained  to  participants  before 

experiment.  So 

they  knew 

the  relationship 

between  blurred  vision  and  head  motion.  They 

also  knew  the  vision  would  become  clear  again 

after  head  stop  moving.  However,  this  process 

was forgotten for one participant. As a result, the 

participant  felt  very  discomfort  (nausea)  in  3 

minutes. The experiment had to be stopped. After 

the participant was told about the relationship an 

hour later, the participant did not feel discomfort   

during  the  latter  experiment  and  the  experiment 

ended after 20 minutes. This example may show 

that the error in feedback loop is a direct cause of 

discomfort,  and  the  consciously  interfering  of 

human  brain  can  play  an  important  role  in  this 

loop.
