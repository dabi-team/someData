Abstract 

Immersive virtual reality (VR) emerges as a promising research and clinical tool. However, several 
studies suggest that VR induced adverse symptoms and effects (VRISE) may undermine the health 
and safety standards, and the reliability of the scientific results.  In the current literature review, the 
technical reasons for the adverse symptomatology are investigated to provide suggestions and 
technological knowledge for the implementation of VR head-mounted display (HMD) systems in 
cognitive neuroscience. The technological systematic literature indicated features pertinent to 
display, sound, motion tracking, navigation, ergonomic interactions, user experience, and computer 
hardware that should be considered by the researchers. Subsequently, a meta-analysis of 44 
neuroscientific or neuropsychological studies involving VR HMD systems was performed. The meta-
analysis of the VR studies demonstrated that new generation HMDs induced significantly less 
VRISE and marginally fewer dropouts. Importantly, the commercial versions of the new generation 
HMDs with ergonomic interactions had zero incidents of adverse symptomatology and dropouts.  
HMDs equivalent to or greater than the commercial versions of contemporary HMDs accompanied 
with ergonomic interactions are suitable for implementation in cognitive neuroscience. In conclusion, 
researchers’ technological competency, along with meticulous methods and reports pertinent to 
software, hardware, and VRISE, are paramount to ensure the health and safety standards and the 
reliability of neuroscientific results.

Introduction 

In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has attracted attention, demonstrating its utility and 
potency in the field of neuroscience and neuropsychology (Rizzo et al., 2004; Bohil et al., 2011; 
Parsons, 2015). Traditional approaches in human neuroscience involve the utilization of static and 
simple stimuli which arguably lack ecological validity (Parsons, 2015). VR offers the usage of 
dynamic stimuli and interactions with a high degree of control within an ecologically valid 
environment which enables the collection of advanced cognitive and behavioral data (Rizzo et al., 
2004; Bohil et al., 2011; Parsons, 2015). VR can be combined with non-invasive imaging techniques 
(Bohil et al., 2011; Parsons, 2015) and has been effective in the assessment of cognitive and affective 
functions and clinical conditions (e.g., social stress disorders) which require ecological validity 
(Rizzo et al., 2004; Parsons, 2015) for their assessment, rehabilitation and treatment (e.g., post-
traumatic stress disorder) (Rizzo et al., 2004; Bohil et al., 2011).  

However, researchers and clinicians have reported caveats with the implementation of immersive VR 
interventions and assessments, particularly when head mounted display (HMD) systems are utilized 
(Sharples et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2015; de Franca & Soares, 2017; Palmisano et al., 2017). A 
predominant concern is the presence of adverse physiological symptoms (i.e., cyber/simulation-
sickness which includes nausea, disorientation, instability, dizziness, and fatigue). These undesirable 
effects are categorized as VR Induced Symptoms and Effects (VRISE) (Sharples et al., 2008; Davis 
et al., 2015; de Franca & Soares, 2017; Palmisano et al., 2017), and are evaluated by using 
questionnaires such as the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (Kennedy et al., 1993) and the Virtual 
Reality Sickness Questionnaire (Kim et al., 2018). 

VRISE may risk the health and safety of participants or patients (Kane & Parsons, 2017; Parsons et 
al., 2018), which raises ethical considerations for the adoption of VR HMDs as research and clinical 
tools. Additionally, the presence of VRISE has modulated substantial decline in reaction times and 
overall cognitive performance (Plant & Turner, 2009; Nalivaiko et al., 2015; Plant, 2016; Nesbitt et 
al., 2017; Mittelstaedt et al., 2018), as well as increasing body temperature and heart rates (Nalivaiko 
et al., 2015). Also, the presence of VRISE robustly increases cerebral blood flow and oxyhemoglobin 
concentration (Gavgani et al, 2018), the power of brain signals (Arafat et al., 2018), and the 
connectivity between stimulus response brain regions and nausea-processing brain regions (Toschi et 
al., 2017). Thus, VRISE could be considered confounding variables, which significantly undermine 
the reliability of neuropsychological, physiological, and neuroimaging data. 

VRISE are predominantly mediated by an oculomotor discrepancy between what is being perceived 
through the oculomotor (optic nerve) sensor and what is being sensed via the rest of the afferent 
nerves in the human body (Sharples et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2015; de Franca & Soares, 2017; 
Palmisano et al., 2017). Nevertheless, technologically speaking, VRISE are derivatives of hardware 
and software inadequacies, i.e., the type of display screen, resolution and refresh rate of the image, 
the size of the field of view as well as non-ergonomic movements within an interaction in the virtual 
environment (VE; de Franca & Soares, 2017; Palmisano et al., 2017). Notably, VR HMDs have 
substantially evolved during the last two decades. Important differences may be seen between the 
HMDs released before 2013 (old generation) and those released from 2013 onwards (new 
generation). While the last old generation HMD was released in 2001 (i.e., nVisor SX111), the year 
2013 is used to distinguish between old and new generation HMDs, since it is the year that the first 
new generation HMD prototype (i.e., Oculus Development Kit 1) was released. This systematic 
review attempts to clarify the technological etiologies of VRISE and provide pertinent suggestions 
for the implementation of VR HMDs in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology. In addition, a

meta-analysis of the neuroscience studies that have implemented VR HMDs will be conducted to 
elucidate the frequency of VRISE and dropout rates as per the VR HMD generation.

Technological systematic review 

In Table 1, a glossary of the key terms and concepts is provided to assist with comprehension of the 
utilized terminology. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using a decremental stepwise method to perform the literature review 
(see Figure 1).  The selected papers and book chapters included an explicit explanation and 
discussion of VRISE and users’ experiences pertinent with the specified technological features of the 
VR hardware and software. Digital databases specialized in technologies were used: 1) IEEE Xplore 
Digital Library; 2) ACM Digital Library; 3) ScienceDirect; 4) MIT CogNet; and 5) Scopus. Two 
categories of keywords were used, where each category had three or more keywords and each paper 
had to include at least one keyword from each category in the main body of the text.  The categories 
were: 1) “virtual reality” OR “immersive virtual reality” OR “head-mounted display”; AND 2) 
“VRISE” OR “motion sickness” OR “cyber sickness” OR “simulation sickness”. Finally, the 
extracted information from the identified papers was clustered together under common features (i.e., 
display, sound, motion tracking, navigation, ergonomic interactions, user experience, and computer 
hardware).

Terms & Concepts 

Explanation/Definition 

Head Mounted Display (HMD) 

A display device which is worn on the head and provides an immersive 

virtual reality for the wearer. 

Development Kit (DK) HMD 

A prototype device, which is utilized by the VR Software developers to 

develop VR software before the commercial version of an HMD. The 

DKs are not provided for general use. 

Commercial Version (CV) HMD  

The final version of an HMD, which is dispersed to the market for 

general use. 

Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) 

A type of display/screen that uses the light-modulating properties of 

liquid crystals. Liquid crystals emit light indirectly, instead of using a 

reflector to produce images. 

Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) 

A type of display/screen that uses an organic compound film that emits 

light in response to an electric current. OLEDs are used as displays in 

devices such as television screens, computer monitors, and smartphones. 

Field of View (FOV) 

The area captured by the display device. The size of the FOV and the 

size of the display device directly affect the quality of the image. 

Refresh Rate & Frame Rate 

The refresh rate is the number of times that the hardware updates its 

display per second. It involves the repeated display of identical frames. 

The frame rate indicates the frequency that software can add new data to 

a display. 

Resolution 

The number of distinct pixels in each dimension displayed in a frame. 

Motion tracking 

facilitated by motion sensors which detect the position of motion trackers 

The process of tracking the movement of objects or people.  It is 

embedded in devices (e.g., HMDs and 6 DoF controllers). 

Controllers/Wands with 6 degrees of freedom 

Controllers which have 6DoF of movement in 3-D space on three 

(DoF) 

directional axes (i.e., Forward-Back, Left-Right, Up-Down) and three 

Direct Hand Interaction 

A motion tracking device (i.e., a motion sensor) which directly tracks 

rotational axes (i.e., Roll, Pitch, Yaw). 

Teleportation 

A navigation system, which allows the user to be transferred to a new 

location in the virtual environment without physically moving in the real 

hand movements  

environment. 

Ergonomic Interactions 

These resemble real-life interactions, which optimize user experience 

and overall VR system performance (see also 3.2.3 Definition of 

Ergonomic Interactions). Ergonomic interactions are facilitated by and 

restricted to the capabilities of the VR hardware and software. 

Virtual Environment (VE) 

A three-dimensional artificial environment which is displayed on a 

display device and allows the users to interact with it.

2.1  Technological Etiologies of VRISE 

2.1.1 Display 

VR HMDs use the following three types of screens: Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT); Liquid Crystal 
Display (LCD); and organic light emitting diode (OLED).  LCD screens replaced CRT ones due to 
VRISE (Costello, 1997). LCD, in comparison to CRT, alleviated the probability of visual 
complications and physical burdens (e.g., fatigue) (Costello, 1997). However, the suitability of LCD 
was challenged by the emergence of OLED screens. While old generation VR HMDs mainly utilize 
LCD screens (Costello, 1997), the commercial versions of new generation VR HMDs predominantly 
use OLED screens (Kim et al., 2017). The OLED screens have been found to be better than LCD 
screens for general implementation in VR, because of their faster response times, lighter weight, and 
better color quality (Kim et al., 2017). OLED screens decrease the likelihood of VRISE and offer an 
improved VR display (Kim et al., 2017). 

Three more factors related to display type are crucial for the avoidance of VRISE: the width of the 
Field of View (FOV) (Rakkolainen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017); the resolution of the image per eye 
(Hecht, 2016; Rakkolainen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017; Brennesholtz, 2018); and the latency of the 
images (frames per second) (Hecht, 2016; Rakkolainen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017; Brennesholtz, 
2018). A wider FOV significantly decreases the chance of VRISE and increases the level of 
immersion (Rakkolainen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017). The canonical guidelines suggest a lowest 
threshold of 110o FOV (diagonal) (Hecht, 2016; Rakkolainen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017; 
Brennesholtz, 2018). In addition, an increased refresh rate and resolution alleviates the danger of 
discomfort or VRISE (Hecht, 2016; Rakkolainen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017; Brennesholtz, 2018). 
The refresh rate should be ≥ 75Hz (i.e., ≥ 75 frames per second) (Goradia et al., 2014; Hecht, 2016; 
Brennesholtz, 2018), while the resolution is required to be higher than 960 x 1080 sub-pixels per eye 
(Goradia et al., 2014). 

2.1.2 Sound 

A second important consideration for a user’s experience in VR is the sound quality. The integration 
of spatialized sounds (e.g., ambient and feedback sounds) in the VE may increase the level of 
immersion, pleasantness of the experience, and successful navigation (Vorländer & Shinn-
Cunningham, 2014), while they significantly decrease the likelihood of VRISE (Viirre et al., 2014). 
However, the volume and localization of sounds need to be optimized in terms of audio spatialization 
to ensure a user’s experience is pleasant without adverse VRISE (Vorländer & Shinn-Cunningham, 
2014; Viirre et al., 2014). 

2.1.3 Motion tracking 

Motion tracking in VR is a precondition for naturalistic movement within an immersive VE (Slater & 
Wilbur, 1997; Stanney & Hale, 2014). Motion tracking allows the precise tracking of the user’s 
physical body within the VE (i.e., it allows the computer to provide accurate environmental feedback, 
which modulates and consolidates the awareness of the position and movement of the user’s body). 
This phenomenon is called proprioception or kinesthesia (Slater & Wilbur, 1997) and is linked with 
vestibular and oculomotor mediated VRISE (Slater & Wilbur, 1997; Plouzeau et al., 2015; Caputo et 
al., 2017). Hence, motion tracking should be adequately rapid and accurate to facilitate ergonomic 
interactions in the VE (Caputo et al., 2017).

 Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience 

2.1.4 Navigation  

A highly important factor in the quality of VR software and to avoid VRISE is the movement of the 
user in the VE (Porcino et al., 2017).  New generation HMDs deliver an adequate play area for 
interactions to facilitate ecologically valid scenarios (Porcino et al., 2017; Borrego et al., 2018). 
However, there are restrictions in the size of the play area, which does not permit navigation solely 
by physical walking (Porcino et al., 2017; Borrego et al., 2018). Teleportation allows movement 
beyond the play area size and elicits a high-level of immersion and pleasant user experience, whilst 
alleviating VRISE (Bozgeyikli et al., 2016; Frommel et al., 2017; Porcino et al., 2017). In contrast, 
movement dependent on a touchpad, keyboard, or joystick results to high occurrences of VRISE 
(Bozgeyikli et al., 2016; Frommel et al., 2017; Porcino et al., 2017).  Therefore, teleportation in 
conjunction with physical movement (i.e., free movement of the upper limbs and walking in a small-
restricted area) is the most suitable method for movement in VR (Bozgeyikli et al., 2016; Frommel et 
al., 2017; Porcino et al., 2017). Yet, there are additional factors such as external hardware (i.e., 
controllers and wands), which are needed to facilitate optimal ergonomic interactions in VR. 

2.1.5 Ergonomic Interactions 

Ergonomic and naturalistic interactions are essential to minimize the risk of VRISE, while non-
ergonomic and non-naturalistic interactions increase the occurrence of them (Slater & Wilbur, 1997; 
Stanney & Hale, 2014; Plouzeau et al., 2015; Caputo et al., 2017; Porcino et al., 2017). Importantly, 
controllers, joysticks, and keyboards do not support ergonomic and naturalistic interactions in VR 
(Plouzeau et al., 2015; Bozgeyikli et al., 2016; Caputo et al., 2017; Frommel et al., 2017; Porcino et 
al., 2017; Sportillo et al., 2017; Figueiredo et al., 2018). Instead, wands with 6 degrees of freedom 
(DoF) of movement (e.g., Oculus Rift and HTC Vive wands), and realistic interfaces with direct hand 
interactions (e.g., Microsoft’s Kinect) facilitate naturalistic and ergonomic interactions (Sportillo et 
al., 2017; Figueiredo et al., 2018). Both hardware systems facilitate easy familiarization with their 
controls and their utilization (Sportillo et al., 2017; Figueiredo et al., 2018). However, direct hand 
interactions are easier than 6DoF controllers-wands in terms of familiarization with their controls and 
efficiency (Sportillo et al., 2017; Figueiredo et al., 2018). Direct hand interactions were also found to 
offer more pleasant user experiences (Sportillo et al., 2017; Figueiredo et al., 2018), although, they 
are substantially less accurate than 6DoF controller-wands (Sportillo et al., 2017; Figueiredo et al., 
2018).  

2.1.6 User Experience 

Notably, ergonomic interactions might be available to the user; however, the user is required to learn 
the necessary interactions and how the VE functions to facilitate a pleasant user experience (Gromala 
et al., 2016; Jerald et al., 2017; Brade et al., 2018). The inclusion of comprehensible tutorials where 
the user may spend an adequate amount of time acquiring the necessary skills (i.e., navigation, use 
and grab of items, two-handed interactions) and knowledge of the VE (i.e., how it reacts to your 
controls) is crucial (Gromala et al., 2016; Jerald et al., 2017; Brade et al., 2018). Additionally, in-
game instructions and prompts should be offered to the user through interactions in the VE (e.g., 
directional arrows, non-player characters, signs, labels, ambient sounds, audio, and videos) (Gromala 
et al., 2016; Jerald et al., 2017; Brade et al., 2018). 

2.1.7 Computer Hardware 

The computer hardware (i.e., the processor, graphics card, sound card) should at least meet the 
minimum requirements of the VR software and HMD (Anthes et al., 2016). The performance of VR 
HMDs is analogous to the computing power and the quality of the hardware (Anthes et al., 2016; 

7 

 
 
 
 
 Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience 

Stanney & Hale, 2014; Borrego et al., 2018). The processor, graphics card, sound card, and operating 
system (e.g., Windows) need to be considered and reported because they modulate the performance 
of the software (Plant & Turner, 2009; Plant, 2016; Kane & Parsons, 2017; Parsons et al., 2018). 
Research software developers and researchers are required to be technologically competent in order 
to opt for the appropriate hardware and software to achieve their research and/or clinical aims (Plant, 
2016; Kane & Parsons, 2017; Parsons et al., 2018). 

2.2  Conclusions  

Based on the outcomes of the above technological review, VR HMDs should have a good quality 
display-screen (i.e., OLED or upgraded LCD), an adequate FOV (i.e., diagonal FOV ≥ 110o), 
adequate resolution per eye (i.e., resolution > 960 x 1080 sub-pixels per eye), and an adequate image 
refresh rate (i.e., refresh rate ≥75Hz) to safeguard the health and safety of the participants and the 
reliability of the neuroscientific results (see Table 2). Also, the VR HMD should have external 
hardware which offers an adequate VR area, fast and accurate motion tracking, spatialized audio, and 
ergonomic interactions. The computer’s processor, graphics card, and sound card should meet the 
minimum requirements of the VR software and HMD too. New generation VR HMDs appear to have 
all the necessary hardware characteristics (i.e., graphics, level of immersion, and sound) to be used in 
ecological valid research and clinical paradigms (Borrego et al., 2018; see Table 2 for a comparison 
between old and new generation HMDs).  New generation VR HMDs have the required hardware to 
support and produce high-quality spatialized sounds in VEs (Borrego et al., 2018). Additionally, new 
generation VR HMDs have integrated rapid and precise motion tracking which facilitates naturalistic 
and ergonomic interactions within the VE (Borrego et al., 2018).  

Both the Oculus development kit (DK) 1 and DK2 do not meet the minimum hardware features 
highlighted by the technological review, despite being new generation VR HMDs (see Table 2). The 
DK1 has substantially lower resolution per eye and image refresh rates, while the DK2 has 
marginally acceptable refresh rates, yet a slightly lower resolution per eye. These DKs are not 
available for general use but are used by professional developers to produce beta (early) versions of 
their games or apps (Goradia et al., 2014; Suznjevic et al., 2017). Moreover, they were removed from 
the market after the release of the Oculus Rift CV. VR HMDs should have hardware characteristics 
equal to or better than the commercial versions (CV) of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive in order to 
ensure the health & safety of the participants, as well as the reliability of the neuroscientific results 
(i.e., physiological, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data). The researchers and clinicians 
should have the technological competence to choose an HMD which is equal to or greater than the 
CVs of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive (e.g., Valve Index, HTC Vive Pro, Oculus Quest, Pimax VR, 
and StarVR). 

However, the VR software’s features are equally important. The VR software should include an 
ergonomic interaction and navigation system, as well as tutorials, in-game instructions, and prompts. 
A suitable navigation system should combine teleportation and physical movement, while ergonomic 
interactions should include those that simulate real-life interactions by using a direct hands system or 
6DoF controllers. Also, the tutorials, in-game instructions, and prompts should be informative and 
easy to follow, especially for experimental or clinical purposes where users should be equally able to 
interact with the VE (Plant & Turner, 2009; Plant, 2016; Kane & Parsons, 2017; Parsons et al., 
2018). The criteria for effective VR software are displayed in Table 3. These criteria should be met 
before implementing VR software for research and/or clinical purposes. Otherwise, researchers or 
clinicians may compromise the reliability of their study’s results (Plant & Turner, 2009; Plant, 2016;

Kane & Parsons, 2017; Parsons et al., 2018), and/or jeopardize the health and safety of their 
participants/patients (Kane & Parsons, 2017; Parsons et al., 2018).   

The above features enable researchers or clinicians to administer a sophisticated and pleasant VR 
experience, which substantially alleviates or eradicates adverse VRISE. Therefore, the technological 
competency of neuroscientists and neuropsychologists is a precondition for the efficient adoption and 
implementation of innovative technologies like VR HMDs in cognitive neuroscience or 
neuropsychology.

3  Meta-analysis of VR studies in cognitive neuroscience 

3.1  Literature Research and Inclusion Criteria 

We followed the PRISMA guidelines to conduct the literature research using a decremental 
approach, where the selection commenced with a relatively vast accumulation of abstracts and 
concluded with a diminished list of full papers that comprise standardised and detailed VR research 
paradigms. The procedure is described in Figure 2. The following databases were used for the 
literature research:  1) PsycInfo; 2) PsycArticles; 3) PubMed; and 4) Medline. Two categories of 
keywords were used, with three keywords in each category. The minimum threshold for each study 
was the inclusion of at least one keyword from each category in the main body of text. The keywords 
for each category were: 1) “virtual reality”; OR “Immersive”; OR “Head Mounted Display”; AND 2) 
“Psychology”; OR “Neuropsychology” OR “Neuroscience”. Additional filters and criteria were: 1) 
chronological specification (2004 and later); and 2) a comprehensive description of the VR research 
methods in conjunction with the research aims and results. Finally, the selected studies were 
allocated into two groups according to the generation of the implemented VR HMD. Two tables 
display the studies that utilise old generation (Table 4) and new generation (Table 5) HMDs.

3.2  Data Collection and Coding  

3.2.1 Target Variables 

The principal aim of the meta-analysis was to measure the frequency of VRISE in neuroscience or 
psychology studies using a VR HMD. However, only six studies reported VRISE quantitatively (i.e., 
using a questionnaire). For this reason, we considered only the presence or absence of VRISE. The 
dichotomous VRISE variable (i.e., presence or absence of VRISE) was quantified (i.e., absent 
VRISE = 0; present VRISE = 1) to facilitate a comparison (i.e., Bayesian t-tests) between the studies 
that used old generation HMDs, new generation DK HMDs, and new generation CV HMDs, as well 
as the examination of potential correlations with other variables (i.e., Bayesian Pearson’s correlation 
analysis). 

A secondary aim of the meta-analysis was to inspect the dropout rates in neuroscience or psychology 
studies that used VR HMDs. However, as the vast majority of studies had no dropouts, studies with 
some dropouts (e.g., 3, 5, 6) were statistically considered as outliers. For this reason, we considered 
the existence of dropouts in each study. The dropout variable was dichotomized as presence = 1 and 
absence = 0. This dichotomous dropout variable was used to investigate whether using a certain 
generation HMD (i.e., old generation HMDs, new generation DK HMDs, or new generation CV 
HMDs) could increase/decrease the dropout size. We compared (i.e., Bayesian t-tests) the dropout 
rate across studies that used old generation HMDs, new generation DK HMDs, and new generation 
CV HMDs. We also inspected whether the dropout rates correlated with other variables by using 
Bayesian Pearson’s correlation analysis. 

3.2.2 Grouping Variables  

We subdivided studies into groups based on the HMD generation they used. Hence, two groups of 
studies were created and compared by using Bayesian t-tests; the first group included studies that 
utilized old generation HMDs, while the second group included studies which utilized new 
generation HMDs (i.e., both DKs and CVs).  

The new generation studies were further distinguished and compared by using Bayesian t-tests based 
on the type of new generation HMDs adopted (i.e., DK or CV). Two sub-groups were formed; the 
first group included studies that utilized DK HMDs, and the second group included studies that 
utilized CV HMDs.  

Furthermore, the recency of the HMD technology was compared by using an ordinal variable where 
1 indicated old generation HMDs, 2 indicated new generation DKs, and 3 indicated new generation 
CVs. This ordinal variable allowed us to inspect whether the HMD generation correlated with other 
variables by using Bayesian Pearson’s correlation analysis. 

Lastly, we considered the type of interactions, where the type of interactions were expressed in a 
binary form (i.e., non-ergonomic interactions = 0 and ergonomic interactions = 1). This allowed a 
comparison between the VR studies which had ergonomic interactions and the VR studies which had 
non-ergonomic interactions by using a Bayesian t-test. It also allowed us to inspect whether the 
interaction type correlated with other variables (i.e., Bayesian Pearson’s correlation analysis).

 Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience 

3.2.3 Definition of Ergonomic Interactions  

In line with the definition of ergonomic interactions in our technological review, we considered 
interactions to be ergonomic or non-ergonomic based on their proximity to real-life interactions. We 
provide some examples below to clarify our criteria: 

Example 1 - Ergonomic Interaction: if the VR software required the participant to look around 
moving his or her head. 

Example 2 - Non-Ergonomic Interaction: if the VR software required the participant to look around 
by using a joystick or mouse.  

Example 3 - Ergonomic Interaction: if the VR software required the user to interact with objects (e.g., 
pushing a button, holding an item) in the VE or to navigate within the VE by using either 6DoF 
controllers or direct-hand interactions.  

Example 4 - Non-Ergonomic Interaction: if the VR software required the user to interact with objects 
(e.g., pushing a button, holding an item) in the VE or to navigate within the VE by using a keyboard 
or joystick (e.g., Xbox controller).  

3.3  Statistical Analyses 

Bayesian statistics were preferred over null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). The Bayesian 
factor (BF10) was therefore used instead of p-values for statistical inference, although we do report 
both BF10 and p-values. P-values measure the difference between the data and the null hypothesis 
(H0) (e.g., the assumption of no difference or no effect), while the BF10 calibrates p-values by 
converting them into evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H1) over the H0 (Cox & 
Donnelly, 2011; Bland, 215; Held & Ott, 2018). BF10 is considered substantially more parsimonious 
than the p-value in evaluating the evidence against the H0 (Cox & Donnelly, 2011; Bland, 2015; Held 
& Ott, 2018). Also, the difference between BF10 and the p-value in evaluating the evidence against H0 
is even greater in small sample sizes (Held & Ott, 2018). Bayesian Factor (BF10) threshold ≥ 10 was 
set for statistical inference in all analyses, which indicates strong evidence in favor of the H1 (Rouder 
& Morey, 2012; Wetzels & Wagenmakers, 2012; Marsman & Wagenmakers, 2017), and corresponds 
to a p-value <.01 (e.g., BF10 = 10) (Cox & Donnelly, 2011; Bland, 2015; Held & Ott, 2018). JASP 
software was used to perform the statistical analyses (JASP Team, 2018). Bayesian independent 
samples t-tests were conducted to investigate the difference in VRISE frequency and dropout 
occurrence between old and new generation HMDs, as well as between new generation DKs and 
CVs. A Bayesian Pearson’s correlations analysis examined the possible statistical relationships 
amongst the HMD generations, VRISE presence, the type of interactions, and dropout occurrences. 

3.4  Results 

3.4.1 The Implementation of Old and New Generation HMDs in Cognitive Neuroscience  

The studies that utilized old generation HMDs are displayed in Table 4 and recruited 1200 
participants in total. Nine out of 22 studies examined stress disorders, 7 of these were VR exposure 
therapy (VRET) studies either for phobias or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while 2 studies 
attempted to assess stress levels in context (e.g., assessment of social stress during a job interview).  
In 9 studies, there were VR assessments of cognitive functions, 2 studies assessed memory, 3 studied 
attention, 3 examined executive functions, and one examined visuospatial ability. Two of the studies 
involved social cognition while only one involved paranoid thinking. Lastly, only one study provided 

15 

 
 
 
 
 Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience 

rehabilitation sessions in VR for patients with spinal injuries. The targeted age groups were young 
adults in 18 studies, middle-aged adults in 8 studies, older adults in one study, and children in one 
study. 

The studies that utilized new generation HMDs are displayed in Table 5 and recruited 982 

individuals in total. Specifically, 376 individuals were recruited in 10 studies where new generation 
DKs were used, while 606 individuals were recruited in 12 studies where new generation CVs were 
used. Nine out of the 22 studies attempted to assess cognitive functions (i.e., memory, attention, 
visuospatial ability, executive functions), 4 investigated anxiety disorders (i.e., fear of death, social 
stress, general anxiety disorder), 3 provided sensorimotor rehabilitation interventions, 3 studies 
examined the effects of presence in specific VEs, 2 assessed social cognition and one study offered a 
psychoeducational session to patients with motor-related disorders. Lastly, the targeted age groups 
were young adults in 18 studies, middle-aged adults in 6 studies, and older adults in 4 studies. 

3.4.2 Meta-Analysis 

The descriptive statistics are presented in Figures 3 and 4. In Figure 3, the number of studies with 
VRISE are displayed according to their HMD generation and interaction type. In Figure 4, the 
dropouts and sample sizes are presented according to their HMD generation, VRISE presence, and 
interaction type. The presence of VRISE substantially becomes less frequent when new generation 
HMDs are implemented (Figure 3). In new generation HMDs, VRISE are present in only 4 out of 22 
studies, while across 982 participants, there are only 11 dropouts. In contrast, in old generation 
HMDs, VRISE are present in 14 out of 22 studies, while in a total sample size of 1200 participants, 
there are 58 dropouts.  

In the 14 old generation HMDs studies where VRISE are present, half of them involved ergonomic 
interactions and the other half involved non-ergonomic interactions. Similarly, there is an equal 
distribution of dropouts (29 in each) between the old generation HMDs studies that had ergonomic 
and non-ergonomic interactions. When only old HMDs with ergonomic interactions are considered, 
VRISE are present in 7 out of 12 studies, while in an entire sample size of 598, the dropouts are 29. 
In the studies with new generation DKs, non-ergonomic interactions had an increased presence of 
VRISE than the ones with ergonomic interactions. Also, in the studies which used DKs with non-
ergonomic interactions, 7 participants out of 158 dropped out, while in studies with ergonomic 
interactions, only one participant out of 218 dropped out. Importantly, when new generation CVs 
with ergonomic interactions are exclusively considered, there are no VRISE or dropouts in any of the 
11 studies with 546 participants. Finally, VRISE were only present in one study using a new 
generation CV HMD, where 3 participants dropped out. This study was the only one with a new 
generation CV HMD that did not involve ergonomic interactions. 

The Bayesian independent samples t-test highlighted that studies involving new generation VR 
HMDs have significantly less frequent VRISE (BF10 = 144.68; p < .001). The difference in the 
existence of dropouts was not substantial, yet the studies with new generation HMDs have less 
frequent dropouts (BF10 = 4.69; p < .05) than studies with old HMDs. Notably, the studies which used 
a new generation CV HMD have significantly less frequent VRISE (BF10 = 46.39; p < .001) but not 
less frequent dropouts (BF10 = 1.66; p = .16) than the studies which used a new generation DK HMD. 
Finally, the studies which implemented VR software with ergonomic interactions had substantially 
less frequent VRISE (BF10 = 19.54; p < .001) and dropouts (BF10 = 16.01; p < .001) than studies 
which used VR software with non-ergonomic interactions.

 Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience 

The Bayesian Pearson’s correlations demonstrated a substantial negative correlation between the 
presence of VRISE and the HMD generation (BF10 = 328.03; r (44) = -0.56, p < .001), while the 
presence of VRISE robustly demonstrated a positive correlation with the existence of dropouts (BF10 
= 83510.53; r (44) = 0.68, p < .001). Also, the utilization of ergonomic interactions was significantly 
negatively correlated with VRISE (BF10 = 20.11; r (44) = -0.42, p < .001) and the existence of 
dropouts (BF10 = 16.11; r (44) = -0.41, p < .001).

3.5  Discussion 

The results of the meta-analysis indicated that VR HMDs have been implemented in diverse clinical 
conditions and age groups, as well as the unquestionable difference between old generation and new 
generation HMDs. There were significantly more frequent VRISE in the studies involving old 
generation VR HMDs compared to studies with new generation HMDs. Additionally, the frequency 
of VRISE correlated negatively with the HMD generation. Hence, the older the utilized HMD, the 
higher the VRISE frequency. Moreover, the existence of dropouts significantly and positively 
correlated with the presence of VRISE. 

Nevertheless, one potential reason for the higher dropouts in old generation studies is that several 
studies included follow-up sessions (e.g., VRET) and participants may have opted not to return to 
complete the remaining sessions for reasons other than the presence of VRISE.  However, in the old 
generation studies, the dropout rates were low in relation to the size of the population, albeit there 
were VRISE present. The low dropout rates in the old generation HMD studies may be due to the 
fixed intervals between the VR sessions where the participants were able to rest and obtain relief 
from any adverse effects they were experiencing.  

Furthermore, the incidence of VRISE in old generation HMD studies may be due to anxiety levels 
(Bouchard et al., 2011) or be self-induced (Almeida et al., 2017) as several of the studies had either 
stress-related aims or included participants with stress disorders. However, several of the new 
generation HMD studies also had comparable aims and/or populations and included patients with 

18 

 
 
 
 
 Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience 

clinical conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and movement disorders) 
which have high comorbidity with stress and anxiety (Factor et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2000; Jenner, 
2003; Allen & Bayraktutan, 2009). Also, the rates of self-induced VRISE are expected to be equal in 
both new and old generation HMD studies. In addition, the reporting of VRISE may be for reasons 
unrelated to the quality of the hardware or software (e.g., subjectivity in the reporting of VRISE, 
individual differences in the experience of VRISE) (Kortum & Peres, 2014; Almeida et al., 2017). 
However, this modulation is again expected to have affected both new and old generation HMD 
studies in a similar way.  

Beyond the difference between old and new generations HMDs, a substantial difference is observed 
between DK and CV new generation HMDs. Significantly fewer VRISE were present in the studies 
that used a CV, indicating the superiority of new generation CV HMDs compared to new generation 
DK HMDs. Furthermore, the studies (i.e., both old and new generation studies) which utilized VR 
software with ergonomic interactions had robustly less frequent VRISE and dropouts than the studies 
which implemented VR software with non-ergonomic interactions. However, the ergonomic 
interactions do not appear to mitigate the dropout frequency and the incidence of VRISE in old 
generation HMDs. In contrast, VRISE were present in more DK studies with non-ergonomic 
interactions compared to DK studies with ergonomic interactions. Similarly, more participants 
dropped out from DK studies with non-ergonomic interactions. Notably, there were no VRISE or 
dropouts in CV studies with ergonomic interactions. Therefore, the contribution of ergonomic 
interactions in the reduction of VRISE increases when newer and better HMDs are utilized. To 
conclude, the findings of the meta-analysis are aligned with the outcomes of the technological 
review.

General Discussion 

4.1  Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience and Neuropsychology 

The findings of our technological literature review suggest that the hardware features of old 
generation HMDs and new generation DKs do not meet the minimum hardware features that alleviate 
or eradicate VRISE. Instead, the technological literature review postulates the suitability of new 
generation CVs which have specific hardware capabilities to alleviate VRISE. However, VR 
software attributes (e.g., ergonomic interactions) are equally vital.  

Secondly, the findings of our meta-analysis of 44 neuroscientific or neuropsychological studies using 
VR are aligned with the outcomes of our technological review, where VRISE were substantially less 
frequent in studies which utilised new generation VR HMDs. In particular, the studies which used 
new generation CVs accompanied by ergonomic interactions did not have any VRISE or dropouts. 
Therefore, the combined outcomes of the technological review and the meta-analysis indicate that the 
appropriate VR HMDs are those with hardware characteristics equal to or greater than the HTC Vive 
and Oculus Rift, though the VR HMD should be implemented in conjunction with VR software 
which offers ergonomic interactions.    

However, researchers may have to opt for an HMD based on their available budget. For example, the 
Oculus Rift costs around $400, while the HTC Vive costs around $500. Moreover, the majority of 
HMDs also require a VR-ready desktop PC or a laptop to be operated, so a researcher needs to 
additionally spend around $500-$1500 for a desktop computer or laptop to utilise these HMDs. 
Hence, the combined cost would be between $800 and $1900. The cost of VR equipment (e.g., both 
HMD and computer) may lead researchers to use HMDs that are cheaper, albeit that they are more 

19 

 
 
 
 
 Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience 

likely to result in VRISE. However, in the market, there are plenty of cost-effective alternatives that 
meet the minimum hardware criteria. For example, the Oculus Quest is a standalone HMD (i.e., it 
does not require a PC, a laptop, or a smartphone to be operated) and it costs approximately $400. 
Hence, a researcher can spend the equivalent of the price of a neuropsychological test or a 
smartphone to acquire and use an HMD that meets the minimum hardware criteria to lower the 
presence of VRISE.   

Nonetheless, the selection of an appropriate VR HMD and software requires technological 
competency from the researchers, clinicians, and/or research software developers. Unfortunately, the 
meta-analysis results do not indicate that technological knowledge of VR has been well established in 
neuroscience. Of course, the utilisation of old generation HMDs and new generation DKs pre-2016 is 
justified as the new generation CVs were not available. However, in our meta-analysis, 25 studies 
were conducted between 2016 and 2019, where half of these studies (13/25) implemented an 
inappropriate HMD (i.e., old generation HMD or new generation DK). However, 10 studies used a 
DK2 which has a marginally lower resolution than the minimum hardware criteria, while our meta-
analysis results indicated that its utilisation in conjunction with ergonomic interactions appears to 
alleviate the frequency of VRISE, but not as effectively as the CV HMDs. Furthermore, one fifth of 
the studies did use a new generation HMD, but they did not have ergonomic interactions in their VR 
software. Therefore, at this time, VR technological competence does not seem to have been well 
established in neuroscience. As a result, in the studies since 2016, the health and safety of the 
participants may not substantially guaranteed, and the reliability of the results may be questionable, 
as VRISE substantially decreases reaction times and overall cognitive performance (Plant & Turner, 
2009; Nalivaiko et al., 2015; Plant, 2016; Nesbitt et al., 2017; Mittelstaedt et al., 2018), as well as 
confounding neuroimaging and physiological data (Toschi et al., 2017; Arafat et al., 2018; Gavgani 
et al, 2018). The selection of an appropriate HMD is paramount for successfully implementing VR 
HMDs in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.  

However, the implementation of the currently available and appropriate HMDs in neuroscience and 
neuropsychology should be compatible with the research aims. For example, in research designs 
where the user should be active (i.e., navigating, walking, and interacting within the VE) instead of 
being idle, or in a standing or a seated position, the researcher should opt for the best HMD that 
permits intense body movement and activity. In this setting, the Oculus Rift was found to be inferior 
to the HTC Vive on pick-and-place (i.e., relocating objects) tasks, whilst the HTC Vive also provided 
a substantially superior VR experience for users compared to the Oculus Rift (Suznjevic et al., 2017). 
Moreover, the HTC Vive provides an interactive area that is twice the size (25 m2) of the Oculus 
Rift, albeit that both are very accurate in tracking (Borrego et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the HTC Vive 
was found to lose motion-tracking and the ground level becomes slanted when the user goes out of 
bounds (Niehorster et al., 2017). This shortcoming solely affects studies where the participant needs 
to go out of the tracking area. In most neuroscientific designs, the recommended maximum play area 
by HTC (6.25 m2) or by Borrego et al., 2018 (25 m2) are both substantially adequate for conducting 
ecological valid experiments (Borrego et al., 2018, Borges et al., 2018). Nonetheless, the slanted 
floor or lost tracking is not a hardware problem but a software one (Borges et al., 2018). In cases 
where the participant is required to go out of the tracking area, the tracking problem or the slanted 
floor may be easily corrected by adding 3 additional trackers (Peer et al., 2018), using software with 
an improved algorithm (freely distributed by NASA Ames Research Centre) (Borges et al., 2018), or 
by simply updating the firmware of the lighthouse base stations. In summary, the researchers should 
be technologically competent to not only identify and implement a safe HMD and software, but an 
HMD and software that facilitate the optimal research methods pertinent to their research needs and 
aims.

 Technological Competence in VR Neuroscience 

As discussed in our technological review, the quality of the implemented VR software is equally 
important to avoid VRISE. Our meta-analysis of VR studies indicated that the utilisation of 
ergonomic interactions is crucial albeit with the utilisation of an appropriate HMD. For example, 
Detez et al. (2019) used the HTC Vive to investigate physiological arousal and behaviour during 
gambling (Detez et al., 2019). However, the interactions and navigation within the VE were 
facilitated by using a typical controller (Detez et al., 2019). Hence, their VR software did not support 
the utilisation of the ergonomic 6DoF controllers (both hands) of the HTC Vive, which facilitate 
naturalistic navigation (e.g., teleportation) and interaction within the VE. Consequently, Detez et al.’s 
(2019) participants experienced VRISE (Detez et al., 2019) and 3 of their participants discontinued 
their sessions and so their data were discarded (Detez et al., 2019). Importantly, Detez et al. (2019) 
only reported the presence of VRISE and dropout size. They did not provide any quantitative data on 
the intensity of VRISE, or the quality of their software attributes (e.g., graphics, sound, tutorials, in-
game instructions and prompts) (Detez et al., 2019). Indeed, only six of the studies in the meta-
analysis provided adequately explicit reports on VRISE and VR software. Since Detez et al. (2019) 
assessed reaction times and heart rates, these data are likely to be affected by VRISE, despite the 
study having a rigorous experimental design and using the HTC Vive. Therefore, it is important to 
use appropriate VR software and external hardware to prevent risks to the health and safety of the 
participants as well as the reliability of the results.  

4.2  Limitations and Future Studies 

The above technological review and meta-analysis of VR studies evidenced the importance of 
technological and methodological features in VR research and clinical designs. However, our meta-
analysis of VR studies has some limitations. The meta-analysis considered VR studies with diverse 
populations and designs, which may have affected the frequency of VRISE and the existence of 
dropouts. Uniformity across studies (e.g., considering only VRET, assessments or a specific clinical 
population) was not possible due to the scarcity of neuroscience studies involving VR, especially 
using new generation HMDs. Moreover, the review did not consider any software details due to the 
scarceness of such descriptions in published studies. Future VR studies should report software and 
hardware features to allow an in-depth meta-analysis. Equally, only six studies provided quantitative 
reports of VRISE intensity, consequently, only the presence or absence of VRISE was considered. 
The dichotomous consideration of VRISE is susceptible to reports based on subjective criteria and 
individual differences, but this is likely to have affected the VRISE rates in both old and new 
generation studies. Future studies should aim to appraise the quality of the software and intensity of 
VRISE (e.g., using questionnaires). Studies should also attempt to clarify the acceptable duration of 
immersive VR sessions, which will aid researchers in designing their studies appropriately. 
Importantly, the cost of the VR software development should also be considered. Finally, studies 
should attempt to provide software development guidelines that enable researchers and/or research 
software developers to develop VR research software without depending on third parties (e.g., 
freelance developers or software development companies) and these guidelines should embed 
suggestions and instructions for VR software development, which meet the criteria discussed above. 

4.3  Conclusion 

The use of VR HMDs is becoming more popular in neuroscience either for clinical or research 
purposes and VR technology and methods have been well accepted by diverse populations in terms 
of age groups and clinical conditions. A more pleasant VR experience and a reduction in VRISE 
symptomatology has been found using new generation CV HMDs, which deliver an adequately high 
display resolution, rapid image refresh rate, ergonomic design and has controllers which allow 

21

naturalistic navigation and movement within the VE environment, especially when there is restricted 
teleportation. The outcomes of the current technological review and meta-analysis support the 
feasibility of new generation VR CV HMDs to be implemented in cognitive neuroscience and 
neuropsychology. The findings of the technological review suggest methods that should be 
considered in the development or selection of VR research software, as well as hardware and 
software features that should be included in the research protocol. The selected VR HMD and the VR 
research software should enable suitable ergonomic interactions, locomotion techniques (e.g., 
teleportation), and kinetic mechanics which ensure VRISE are reduced or completely avoided. A 
meticulous approach and technological competence are compulsory to consolidate the viability of VR 
research and clinical designs in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology.

Table 1. Glossary of key terms and concepts 

Terms & Concepts 

Explanation/Definition 

Head Mounted Display (HMD) 

A display device which is worn on the head and provides an immersive 

virtual reality for the wearer. 

Development Kit (DK) HMD 

A prototype device, which is utilized by the VR Software developers to 

develop VR software before the commercial version of an HMD. The 

DKs are not provided for general use. 

Commercial Version (CV) HMD  

The final version of an HMD, which is dispersed to the market for 

general use. 

Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) 

A type of display/screen that uses the light-modulating properties of 

liquid crystals. Liquid crystals emit light indirectly, instead of using a 

reflector to produce images. 

Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) 

A type of display/screen that uses an organic compound film that emits 

light in response to an electric current. OLEDs are used as displays in 

devices such as television screens, computer monitors, and smartphones. 

Field of View (FOV) 

The area captured by the display device. The size of the FOV and the 

size of the display device directly affect the quality of the image. 

Refresh Rate & Frame Rate 

The refresh rate is the number of times that the hardware updates its 

display per second. It involves the repeated display of identical frames. 

The frame rate indicates the frequency that software can add new data to 

a display. 

Resolution 

The number of distinct pixels in each dimension displayed in a frame. 

Motion tracking 

facilitated by motion sensors which detect the position of motion trackers 

The process of tracking the movement of objects or people.  It is 

embedded in devices (e.g., HMDs and 6 DoF controllers). 

Controllers/Wands with 6 degrees of freedom 

Controllers which have 6DoF of movement in 3-D space on three 

(DoF) 

directional axes (i.e., Forward-Back, Left-Right, Up-Down) and three 

Direct Hand Interaction 

A motion tracking device (i.e., a motion sensor) which directly tracks 

rotational axes (i.e., Roll, Pitch, Yaw). 

Teleportation 

A navigation system, which allows the user to be transferred to a new 

location in the virtual environment without physically moving in the real 

hand movements  

environment. 

Ergonomic Interactions 

These resemble real-life interactions, which optimize user experience 

and overall VR system performance (see also 3.2.3 Definition of 

Ergonomic Interactions). Ergonomic interactions are facilitated by and 

restricted to the capabilities of the VR hardware and software. 

Virtual Environment (VE) 

A three-dimensional artificial environment which is displayed on a 

display device and allows the users to interact with it.
