Abstract

Micro- or minor alloying of metallic glasses is of technological interest. An originally ductile Pd-based monolithic
bulk metallic glass (Pd40Ni40P20) was selectively manipulated by additions of Fe or Co. The alloying eﬀects were
extreme, showing either exceptional ductility upon Co addition or immediate catastrophic failure upon Fe addition when
tested under uniaxial compression or 3-point bending. The amorphous structure was characterized prior to deformation
with respect to its medium-range order (MRO) using variable resolution ﬂuctuation electron microscopy (VR-FEM).
We observe striking diﬀerences in the MRO between the ductile and brittle metallic glasses, with the ductile glasses
exhibiting a rich structural diversity and MRO correlation lengths up to 6 nm. The MRO heterogeneity seems to enable
easier shear banding and hence enhance the deformability.

Keywords: bulk metallic glass; micro-alloying; ﬂuctuation electron microscopy; diﬀraction; amorphous; deformation

Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are promising candidates
for applications [1–4]. However, most BMGs lack ductil-
ity. This is particularly so under tension where, at the end
of the elastic regime, immediate catastrophic failure pre-
dominates [5]. Progress has been made in recent years in
developing monolithic BMGs exhibiting respectable duc-
tility during cold rolling, bending or compression tests [6–
14]. The key parameter for the plasticity seems to be
the structural heterogeneity of the amorphous materials,
which can be manipulated for example by micro- or mi-
nor alloying [7, 10, 15–19]. However, the structural hetero-
geneity is still an ill-deﬁned entity although it is frequently
referred to in connection with the amorphous structure
of monolithic metallic glasses. Thus, understanding the
amorphous structure is of importance. For this purpose,
the concept of medium-range order (MRO) is used to de-
scribe structural correlations in the amorphous state hav-
ing length scales beyond that of atomic bonding. Diﬀerent
MRO models have been proposed which suggest MRO cor-
relation lengths or sizes in the range of about 1 nm [20],
1 − 2 nm [21, 22], 1 − 3 nm [23–25], 1 − 4 nm [26–28] or gen-
erally larger than > 0.5 nm (short-range order) [29–34].
In this study we address the structure-property relation
using a ternary Pd-based BMG (Pd40Ni40P20), which was
selectively manipulated by minor additions of Fe or Co.
The glassy materials were characterized using variable res-
olution ﬂuctuation electron microscopy (VR-FEM). FEM
is a microscopic technique based on a statistical analy-
sis of the variance V (|(cid:126)k|, R) determined from diﬀracted
intensities of nanometer-sized volumes obtained by scan-
ning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) microd-

iﬀraction [28, 30, 35–37]. The advantage of FEM is that
it contains information on the pair-pair correlations from
higher order correlation functions and hence on the MRO
[28, 31, 38–40]. The normalized variance V (|(cid:126)k|, R) of the
spatially resolved diﬀracted intensity I of a nanobeam
diﬀraction pattern (NBDP) is therefore a function of the
scattering vector (cid:126)k and the coherent spatial resolution R:

where (cid:104) (cid:105) indicates the averaging over diﬀerent sample po-
sitions (cid:126)r or volumes, and R denotes the FWHM of the elec-
tron probe [32]. Sampling with diﬀerent parallel coherent
probe sizes, R, is called VR-FEM [41, 42]. It gives insight
into the structural ordering length scale and, using either
peak height or peak integral, provides a semi-quantitative
measure of the MRO volume fraction. Diﬀerences in the
MRO may then be compared with diﬀerences in the prop-
erties of the BMGs [31, 38, 40, 43].

Pd40Ni40P20 samples were produced by melting pure
ingots of Pd (99.5%) and Ni2P (99.9%) in a melt spinner
under argon atmosphere. This master alloy was subse-
quently manipulated by additions of 1 at.% Co or 0.6 at.%
Fe. Prior to casting, the ingots were cycled with boron ox-
ide (B2O3) to purify the samples. For the deformation
tests samples were cut out of the ingots using a diamond
wire saw to give dimensions of 4 mm (length) x 3 mm (di-
ameter) providing a 4:3 aspect ratio [44, 45]. Uniaxial
compression tests were performed in an Instron (Instron,
model 1195) using a strain rate of 2.5 × 10−5 s−1. The
test device was equipped with home-made anvils of extra
hardened B¨ohler S290 microclean steel. Since it has been
demonstrated that compression tests to examine plasticity

are sensitive to both alignment and shape geometry [45],
3-point bending tests were also performed. For brevity,
these results are not included here but they conﬁrmed the
results of the compression tests [10, 43, 46]. More com-
prehensive details of the sample processing and deforma-
tion are given in reference [10, 47]. Electron-transparent
samples were prepared by electropolishing with a BK-2
electrolyte [48] at 16.5 V / −20 ◦C using a Tenupol 5 elec-
tropolishing device (Struers A/S, Denmark).
VR-FEM was performed at 300 kV in a Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc Themis 300 G3 transmission electron microscope
(TEM). NBDPs were acquired with parallel coherent probe
sizes between 0.8 and 8.5 nm at FWHM using a 10 µm C2
aperture. The probe current was set to 15 pA. The relative
foil thickness (t/λ) of the TEM samples was determined
by the log-ratio method using the low-loss part of electron
energy loss (EEL) spectra [49]. All FEM data presented
here were recorded under similar experimental conditions
of t/λ, beam current and acquisition time in order to be
sensitive to changes in the MRO measured by the normal-
ized variance signal. The dwell-time was 4 s for the indi-
vidual NBDPs acquired with a CCD camera (US 2000) at
binning 4 (512x512 pixels). The camera length used was
77 mm. All probe sizes were measured prior to the FEM
experiments directly on the Ceta camera using Digital Mi-
crograph plugins by D. Mitchell [50]. FEM analyses were
performed on the diﬀracted intensities I((cid:126)k, R, (cid:126)r) of sets of
100 individual NBDPs taken from the same scanned areas.
The normalized variance proﬁles were calculated using a
pixel by pixel analysis according to the annular mean of
variance image (ΩV Image(k)) [51–53]. These are shown
in the Supplementary Material (see Figs. S1-S3). MRO

volume fractions were estimated by averaging the peak
heights of the ﬁrst variance peak (Vﬁrst) for each material
and subsequently normalizing to that of the Pd40Ni40P20
master alloy (see Tab. 1).

Results from previous deformation tests [10] are revis-
ited and shown in Fig. 1a. The Pd40Ni40P20 master al-
loy itself shows a remarkable ductility of about 8 % plas-
tic strain. A plastic strain to failure of about 10 % was
achieved with Co addition (1 at. %), while Fe addition (0.6
at. %) led to failure shortly after reaching the elastic limit.
A compilation is given in Tab. 1.
In the following, our main focus is laid on the glassy struc-
ture in order to elucidate factors governing the deforma-
tion behavior of metallic glasses. ”Classical diﬀraction“
analysis (X-ray diﬀraction or selected area electron diﬀrac-
tion (SAED)) conﬁrmed the amorphous nature of the glasses
and revealed no diﬀerence between the investigated mate-
rials that would explain the large diﬀerence in deforma-
bility (see Fig. S4 and reference [10]). The results of
the FEM analyses are displayed in Fig. 1b in the form
of Stratton-Voyles plots [55],
in which the peak inten-
sity of the ﬁrst normalized variance peak V (k) at k =
4.8 nm−1 is plotted against 1/R2 [56]. As expected, one
sees a general decrease of V(k) as R increases. Superim-
posed on this are peaks or plateaus occurring when the
probe size matches MRO correlation lengths present as
a high volume fraction. The less well deﬁned the MRO
correlation length, the wider the plateau. The correlation
lengths were determined using the maximum and mini-
mum data points in the plateau to calculate an arithmetic
mean. The plateaus are indicated by the coloured boxes in
Fig. 1b. The curve of the (PdNiP)-Fe alloy exhibits a sin-

gle plateau, yielding an average MRO correlation length
of (1.6 ± 0.5) nm. The Stratton-Voyles plot for the very
ductile (PdNiP)-Co sample, however, shows three distinct
plateaus indicating a much more diverse MRO distribution
with the following MRO correlation lengths: (1.3±0.3) nm,
(2.2±0.5) nm and (5.3±0.7) nm. The PdNiP ternary mas-
ter alloy displays two distinct plateaus at (1.3 ± 0.6) nm
and (3.5±0.6) nm. These results were conﬁrmed by further
data sets taken from diﬀerent regions in the three samples.
Thus, a pronounced heterogeneity in terms of multiple and
larger MRO correlation lengths was observed for the duc-
tile materials which was not present in the brittle material.
The estimated MRO volume fractions reveal decreases of
about 12 % for Co addition and 4 % for Fe addition rela-
tive to the Pd40Ni40P20 master alloy. All key values of the
FEM analyses are listed in Tab. 1 and these are critically
reviewed below.

First of all, it is worth noting that the Poisson(cid:48)s ratio
of the three BMGs investigated (here ν = 0.4) remained
unaﬀected by the minor alloying [10]. Thus, an explana-
tion for good deformability based on the relatively high
Poisson(cid:48)s ratio can be excluded here [57].
Next, we discuss the observed MRO correlation lengths
extending up to 6 nm. Our understanding of MRO is that
it describes ordering in terms of a correlation of structural
motifs present in the glassy solid at length scales beyond
the ﬁrst neighbour (short-range order) [34, 58]. That is,
the spatial correlations arise from connected clusters which
may serve later as seeds for crystallization. MRO mani-
fests itself in the form of speckles in the diﬀraction pattern
[38, 42]. Since the inspection of the individual NBDPs
(∼ 6000 in total) revealed only speckle contrast and no
diﬀraction spots (reﬂections), we exclude the presence of
crystalline fractions in the form of distinct nanocrystals for
the investigated materials. Thus, the present FEM anal-
yses display only MRO. Experimentally reported MRO
correlation lengths in the literature are typically < 2 nm.
Thus, our observation of lengths up to about 6 nm may at
ﬁrst appear surprising. However, ﬁrstly it is clear from our
data, that not all BMGs contain larger correlation lengths.
Secondly, in order to detect larger correlation lengths one
must probe with larger probe sizes. Thirdly, diﬀerent cor-
relation lengths may be present depending on the thermo-
mechanical history. Further, as stated in the introduction,

some models suggest MRO correlation lengths extending
beyond the 2 nm range. Here we show for the ﬁrst time
MRO correlation lengths extending up to 6 nm and thus
experimentally conﬁrm MRO correlation lengths > 2 nm
suggested by various models [23–28].
Next we address the question how the plasticity is aﬀected
by the MRO volume fraction present in the three materi-
als. A comparison between the relative MRO volume frac-
tions and the mechanical behavior shows no correlation
(see Tab. 1) since the MRO volume fractions decreased in
both modiﬁed alloys. Thus, there is no trend apparent to
explain the observed mechanical behaviour. Further, the
ductility is not explained by the presence of larger MRO
correlation lengths in the ductile BMGs, because a recent
study [19] showed that simply increasing MRO size led to
embrittlement. Thus, it must be the diversity of the MRO
(heterogeneity) which leads to improved ductility.
Finally, we address the question how the MRO relates to
shear banding in BMGs. Upon inhomogeneous deforma-
tion, that is at low temperatures and high stresses, metallic
glasses exhibit plasticity in the form of a macroscopic slid-
ing along localized regions called shear bands having thick-
nesses of about 15 nm or less [59–61]. The deformed sam-
ples which were ductile revealed a high number of ﬁnely
dispersed shear bands penetrating through the surfaces
[62], while the brittle Fe-doped material developed only a
few shear bands of which one of them led to catastrophic
failure [10, 62]. Thus, the plasticity of metallic glasses
is based upon their ability to form multiple shear bands
[63]. Our observations strongly suggest that the ductility
is related to the structural heterogeneity in terms of the
diversity of MRO enabling easier shear banding.

In conclusion: While X-ray diﬀraction or SAED re-
vealed no diﬀerence that explains the diﬀerence in de-
formability, VR-FEM presents clear evidence that minor
alloying has a huge impact on the correlation of the glassy
structures beyond the typically reported 2 nm range, which
directly aﬀects the ductility of the material. This, in turn,
makes minor alloying very promising for tuning the prop-
erties of metallic glasses via MRO engineering.
