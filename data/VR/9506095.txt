ABSTRACT

We present faint galaxy counts from deep V RI images obtained with the Keck Telescope.

These images reach R ∼ 27 in median seeing FWHM ∼ 0.5–0.6 arcsec and we detect a
integrated galaxy number density of 7 × 105 degree−2, equivalent to 3 × 1010 galaxies in the
observable Universe. In addition we present median galaxy colors as a function of magnitude;
bluing trends are visible in all colors to R ∼ 24.5. Fainter than R ∼ 24.5, however, the typical
(V −R) color becomes redder again, (V −I) remains constant, and (R−I) becomes yet bluer.
These trends are consistent with the V RI count slopes, implying a decrease in the V slope
at the faintest levels, which our data supports. Taking advantage of our good seeing we
also present median half-light radii for faint galaxies, these show a steady decline at fainter
magnitudes, leading to an intrinsic half-light radius of ∼ 0.2 arcsec for a typical R ∼ 25.5–26
galaxy. Irrespective of the redshift distribution, the extremely high galaxy surface densities
and their small intrinsic sizes are consistent with a scenario in which the majority of the very
faint ﬁeld population are dwarf galaxies or sub-galactic units.

Introduction

The issue of the total number of galaxies in the visible Universe is more than an academic curiosity;
number counts as a function of apparent magnitude hold important clues to the formation and evolution
of galaxies (see Koo & Kron 1992 for a review). The study of very faint ﬁeld galaxies using CCDs was
pioneered by Tyson (1988) who found an integrated number density of ∼ 2 × 105 degree−2, or ∼ 1010
galaxies over the whole sky at B ∼ 26. Two more recent studies which are notable for their depth and
resolution are those of the Hawaii group (Lilly et al. 1991) and the Durham group (Metcalfe et al. 1991,
Metcalfe et al. 1995). The latter now reach galaxy surface densities in excess of 4 × 105 degree−2 for a
small ﬁeld at a limiting magnitude of B = 27.5. Equivalent surface densities are also being achieved in the
near-infrared, K (Gardner et al. 1994, Cowie et al. 1995, Djorgovski et al. 1995).

Potentially the most interesting result from these studies, ﬁrst observed by Lilly et al. (1991) and
conﬁrmed by Metcalfe et al. (1995) with deeper data, is the change in the slope, α (where log dN/dm ∼ α m),

Institute of Technology and the University of California.

of the deep B counts. The diﬀerential galaxy number counts in the B-band show a decrease in slope from
αB ∼ 0.5 to αB ∼ 0.3 at B ∼ 25 (equivalent to R ∼ 24–24.5). In addition, Roche et al. (1993) claim
that the amplitude of the two-point angular correlation function reaches a minimum around B ∼ 25.
Taken together these two observations have been interpreted by Metcalfe et al. (1995) as a signature of an
increasing dominance of low luminosity galaxies at z >∼ 1. These features, if conﬁrmed and observed in other
passbands, will constrain galaxy evolution models, although redshift information will be required before
any strong conclusions can be drawn.

This letter presents the ﬁrst deep optical counts with the 10-m Keck Telescope. These V RI
observations are both deeper, at a given completeness limit, than previous published observations and more
signiﬁcantly were obtained in good seeing, FWHM ∼ 0.5–0.6 arcsec, providing a wealth of information on
the very faint ﬁeld population.

2. Observations and Analysis

2.1. Observations and Reduction

The observations presented here were obtained by S.R. Kulkarni and J.G. Cohen to study the optical
emission from two high galactic latitude pulsars. Thus for our purposes the ﬁelds provide randomly selected
samples of the faint ﬁeld population. These data were obtained on the night of 1994 August 8 using the Low
Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS, Oke et al. 1995) on the 10-m Keck Telescope, Mauna Kea. The
imaging mode of LRIS provides a 5.7 × 7.3 arcmin ﬁeld onto a thinned Tek detector with 0.21 arcsec/pixel
sampling and 8.0e− readnoise. Conditions during this run were good and the night was photometric; a log
of the observations is given in Table 1. The raw frames, with individual exposure times between 0.5–1.5ks,
were debiased and then ﬂatﬁelded in a standard manner using dome ﬂatﬁelds. For each passband the
dithered frames, with pointing oﬀsets of 10–20 arcsec, were registered and combined using standard IRAF
routines and a clipped-average algorithm to produce the ﬁnal images. We reproduce a randomly chosen
1 × 1 arcmin region from the R frame of 1640+22 in Figure 1.

Photometric calibrations were derived from observations of Landolt (1992) standard stars at air masses
very close to those of our science observations. We estimate the average errors in our absolute calibrations
to be δ <∼ 0.02. Color diﬀerences between the standard stars and typical faint galaxies give systematic errors
of a similar size. The estimated reddening is E(B −V ) = 0.07 (Stark et al. 1992) for both ﬁelds and so we
have applied zero point corrections of δV = 0.16, δR = 0.12 and δI = 0.07. We conservatively estimate our
absolute magnitude calibrations to be good to <∼ 0.1 mag.

2.2. Analysis and Photometry

To analyse these images we elected to use the SExtractor image analysis package (Bertin 1994).
This package is a fast, image analysis program which can detect (using a standard isophotal limit and
area cut algorithm), robustly deblend and analyse sparse and moderately crowded galaxy ﬁelds. The
program provides positions, shapes, image proﬁles, half-light radii, isophotal and aperture magnitudes for
all deblended objects detected on a frame. To detect objects we ﬁrst smooth the frame with the point

– 3 –

spread function, then thresholded it at a level of 2.5σ of the sky noise in the raw frame and identify objects.
This threshold provides a typical point source detection limit of R ∼ 27.2 and appeared optimal in our
incompleteness and noise object analyses.

To obtain total magnitudes for our galaxies we have followed the approach used by Djorgovski et
al. (1995). For the fainter objects we use a ﬁxed aperture (1.5 arcsec diameter or ∼ 2–3×FWHM) to
measure magnitudes, these are then aperture corrected to a 5.6 arcsec diameter under the assumption
that the objects have roughly stellar proﬁles, a correction of δ ∼ −0.14 at R = 26. This assumption was
tested by stacking many faint objects to make “average” faint galaxies with high enough signal-to-noise
for large aperture photometry; we ﬁnd that the average galaxies have aperture corrections close to those
of the stars (as expected from their typical sizes, see below). For the brighter objects in the ﬁeld, those
with isophotal diameters larger than our adopted ﬁxed aperture, we measure isophotal magnitudes above a
surface brightness threshold of 0.9σ of the sky noise (Table 1) and similarly correct to 5.6 arcsec diameter.
The majority of the objects with magnitudes brighter than R ∼ 20.5 are saturated in our frames; we do
not present counts brighter than this limit. To measure colors for our objects we smooth all the frames to
the eﬀective seeing of the worst frame (the V data), before measuring photometry in 1.5 arcsec diameter
apertures for all the objects selected from the R catalogs.

Removal of stars from our object catalog is necessary at brighter magnitudes. With the good seeing

experienced during these observations it is relatively straightforward to use image concentration to identify
the stellar locus to a depth of R = 24.5. Comparison of the colors of these candidate stars to those in
Landolt (1992) conﬁrms their identiﬁcation and supports our estimates of the errors on our absolute color
calibrations of <∼ 0.1 mag. At R = 24.5 the stellar fraction is <∼ 6% and falling, so we do not apply any
correction for stellar contamination fainter than R = 25.

2.3. Completeness Modelling

Non-detection, failure to detect an object that is really there; false detection, detection of non-real,

noise objects; and magnitude errors, incorrect measurement of an object’s ﬂux, all plague faint galaxy
counts. These problems become progressively worse at fainter magnitudes, with their relative importance
depending upon the slope of the counts (because magnitude errors “scatter” plentiful faint objects into
brighter magnitude bins; Eddington bias) and the details of the data reduction procedures.

We assess non-detection and magnitude errors simultaneously with a Monte Carlo simulation that

involves adding artiﬁcial galaxies to the data and re-applying the detection algorithm. In order to simulate
both the mean properties and morphological diversity of faint galaxies we create artiﬁcial objects by
extracting galaxy images at magnitude levels for which errors are negligible and dimming them by 2.5
magnitudes, at a constant angular size. It should be noted that if the scale sizes of galaxies decrease at
fainter magnitudes (c.f. §3) then this procedure will tend to overestimate our incompleteness. Extensive
simulations (> 104 objects per frame, dropped in one at a time) were used to create a large matrix Pij
each element of which is the probability that a galaxy with magnitude mj is detected with a measured
magnitude mi. This matrix contains all of the completeness and magnitude error information. On the
assumption that the counts do not turn over quickly (i.e. α does not change rapidly with magnitude near
the limit of the data), Pij can be projected into a total detection rate ri, the ratio of number observed to
true number at magnitude mi. The true number of galaxies in bin i can then be estimated by dividing the
observed number Ni by the detection rate ri.

To correct for false detections we have created noise frames identical to our observations, geometrically

– 4 –

remapped, combined and analysed them in the same manner as the observations. We subtract the number
counts of noise objects found in these simulated frames from our observed counts. This correction is a few
percent or less, even in our faintest magnitude bins.

The faintest magnitude at which the counts can be reasonably completeness-corrected is subjective;
we truncate our counts at or before the 50% completeness level, beyond which the Poisson errors, or any
other error estimates, lose their meaning.

3. Results and Discussion

We plot in Figure 2 the raw and corrected diﬀerential galaxy number counts from our two ﬁelds. We

measure slopes from the combined ﬁeld counts of: αV = 0.404 ± 0.015 for V = 22–24.25, ﬂattening to
αV = 0.28 ± 0.05 at fainter magnitudes, αR = 0.321 ± 0.001 for R = 21–27 and αI = 0.271 ± 0.009 for
I = 19.5–25.5. We see no obvious variation in the R and I slopes. The evidence for the break in V count
slope at V ∼ 24.5 is certainly not pronounced, but it is stronger in the deeper, wider-area 1640+22 data,
and as we show below it is also seen in the median galaxy colors. The integrated, corrected number counts
are 2.9 × 105 per sq. degree to V = 26.5, 7.3 × 105 to R = 27, and 4.1 × 105 to I = 25.5. We also plot on
Figure 2 counts by other workers. The discrepencies in the count slopes at bright magnitudes may arise
from other groups choosing ﬁelds devoid of bright galaxies, this biases them towards underdense regions
producing a systematic undercount of galaxies at bright and intermediate magnitudes and thus a steeper
slope to the counts. At faint limits we ﬁnd reasonable agreement between the slopes of the various datasets,
with residual diﬀerences in normalisation consistent with the diﬀerent photometric corrections applied by
diﬀerent workers and our quoted photometric errors.

The color distributions for our faint galaxy sample are shown in Figure 3. All show a bluing trend with
fainter magnitude until R ∼ 24–24.5, where a typical galaxy has a ﬂat spectral energy distribution in ν fν
(corresponding to (V − R) ∼ 0.5 and (R − I) ∼ 0.5). Fainter than R ∼ 24–24.5 the typical (V −R) colors
turn-around and become redder, while the (V −I) colors ﬂatten out and the (R−I) continue to become
bluer (c.f. Steidel & Hamilton 1993). If we are observing the same population in all three bands, then these
trends in median color should be reﬂected in diﬀerent count slopes in V RI. At R <∼ 24 the bluing trends
indicate αV > αR > αI as observed. After the turn-around, the colors imply a decrease in αV from steeper
than I at the bright end, to matching the I slope at the faint end. This change in V -band slope is indeed
seen in the counts, although its signiﬁcance is not high.

The good seeing of our observations allow us to study the angular sizes of the faint galaxy population.
We plot in Figure 4 the observed half-light radii, rhl, measured from the R-band images. A gradual, near
linear, decline is seen in the median size of faint galaxies to R ∼ 25.5–26, at which point the median size is
only just distinguishable from the stellar locus. Representing the faint ﬁeld population as exponential disks
leads to an estimate of the intrinsic half-light radius of a typical R = 25.5–26 galaxy of rhl ∼ 0.2 arcsec.
−1
50 kpc at any redshift in any world model, so it is clear
This angular size corresponds to less than 2.9 h
that the typical objects we are detecting are either intrinsically smaller or produce a larger fraction of their
emission in their nuclear regions than local bright galaxies. Splitting the sample in two in each magnitude
bin on the basis of (V −I) color shows no statistical diﬀerence between the sizes of the blue and red galaxies.

In conclusion, we have presented deep galaxy counts in V RI passbands. We ﬁnd a decrease in slope in
our bluest passband, V , at the faint end similar to that seen in the B-band by Metcalfe et al. (1995) at an
equivalent apparent magnitude. Beyond R ∼ 24 it appears that galaxy counts approach log dN/dm ∼ 0.3 m
in all bands, shallow enough to remove the threat of a divergence in the integrated night sky brightness. If

– 5 –

we are not seeing to very high redshift, either because the Universe is Einstein-de Sitter and we are running
out of volume, or because there are few luminous, high redshift ﬁeld galaxies, then the common faint-end
slope in the galaxy counts is a measure of the shape of the galaxy (or possibly pre-galactic fragment, in view
of the small angular size of the faintest objects) luminosity function at the faint end. In these scenarios, the
slope of 0.3 implies a faint end luminosity function Φ(L) ∼ L−1.75 at large look-back times, in contrast to
L−1 observed locally (e.g. Loveday et al. 1992). The faint counts may thus conﬁrm, at higher redshift, the
steepening of the faint-end slope of the luminosity function suggested by analyses of spectroscopic samples
at brighter magnitudes (Eales 1993, Ellis et al. 1995). Interestingly, the roll-over at V ∼ 24.5 is within reach
of the new generation of large telescopes and therefore we may hope for direct spectroscopic observations of
galaxies in this intriguing magnitude range.

Figures

Figure 1 A randomly selected 1 × 1 arcmin ﬁeld from the R image of 1640+22. Objects with magnitudes
in the range R = 26.0–26.5 are marked. Notice the minimal crowding in the frame.

Figure 2 Plots of diﬀerential galaxy counts as a function of magnitude in the V RI passbands in the two
ﬁelds. The raw and corrected counts are represented with skeleton and solid symbols respectively, circles
for ﬁeld 1640+22, squares for 2229+26. The error bars are Poisson plus (on the solid points) an estimated
uncertainty in the completeness correction. Least-square linear ﬁts are shown with solid lines (there are two
ﬁts to the V counts split at V = 24.25). Where applicable, the work of other authors is shown with open
points, these are truncated at the same completeness limit as our data. The following corrections have been
applied to transform the diﬀerent passbands onto our system: Lilly et al. (1991) I = IAB − 0.48 and Steidel
& Hamilton (1993) R = RAB + 0.16.

Figure 3 The typical colors of the faint galaxy population as a function of R magnitude in the two ﬁelds.
The points are medians of samples of 401 galaxies in each bin. The horizontal error-bars show the extent
of the magnitude bin, while the vertical error-bars are 95% conﬁdence limits calculated using boot-strap
resampling of the data, non-detections are included. 1σ limits within our photometry aperture lie outside
the region of the color planes plotted. Note the turn-around in the (V −R) colors at R ∼ 24.0–24.5 and the
ﬂattening of the (V −I) colors at the same magnitude.

Figure 4 The half-light radii as a function of apparent R magnitude for all the objects in our two ﬁelds.
The points are medians of samples of 401 galaxies with error-bars deﬁned in a similar manner to Figure 3.
The seeing diﬀerence between the ﬁelds has been removed by shifting the 2229+26 points. The dotted line
marks the locus of stars, these are excluded from the medians. Each of the dashed lines is a linear ﬁt to the
variation of apparent half-light radius with source magnitude for an exponential disk with a ﬁxed, intrinsic
half-light radius, labelled in arcsec. The solid line shows the detection limit as a function of half-light radius
for an exponential disk. For the most extended sources (rhl >∼ 0.6 arcsec) a bias is visible, such that the
source sizes are progressively underestimated at fainter magnitudes. This bias arises from a combination of
incompleteness beyond R ∼ 25 and the use of inappropriate aperture corrections, the corrections applied
are calculated for “typical”, hence compact, faint galaxies. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the median
source size in the ﬁeld shrinks more rapidly than expected for a population with a ﬁxed intrinsic angular
size. By R ∼ 25.5–26 the half-light radii is asymptotically approaching the stellar locus and indicates a very
small intrinsic size for these faint galaxies, rhl ∼ 0.2 arcsec.
