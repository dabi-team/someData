Reconnecting vortices in a superﬂuid allow for the energy transfer between diﬀerent length scales
and its subsequent dissipation. The present picture assumes that the dynamics of a reconnection
is driven mostly by the phase of the order parameter, and this statement can be justiﬁed in the
case of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), where vortices have a simple internal structure. There-
fore, it is natural to postulate that the reconnection dynamics in the vicinity of the reconnection
moment is universal. This expectation has been conﬁrmed in numerical simulations for BECs and
experimentally for the superﬂuid 4He. Not much has been said about this relation in the context
of Fermi superﬂuids. In this article we aim at bridging this gap, and we report our ﬁndings, which
reveal that the reconnection dynamics conforms with the predicted universal behaviour across the
entire BCS-BEC crossover. The universal scaling also survives for spin-imbalanced systems, where
unpaired fermions induce a complex structure of the colliding vortices.

Introduction— The quantum turbulent state is a tan-
gle of vortex lines, and decays through their interactions,
as was already proposed by Feynman [1]. The recon-
nections of quantum vortex lines have thus been pos-
tulated as the principal mechanism of the decay of the
quantum turbulent state [2–5], which made the under-
standing of reconnection dynamics crucial for this ﬁeld.
The numerical studies of reconnections were ﬁrst per-
formed in the context of the superﬂuid 4He with the
vortex ﬁlament model [6, 7] and then with the micro-
scopic Gross–Pitaevskii equation (GPE) [8]. The semi-
classical model of vortex reconnection was proposed by
Nazarenko and West [9], where the vortex lines before
and after the reconnection were modelled as two hyper-
bolae on the same plane. The resulting solution implied
that the relative distance δ between the lines scales with
the time to the reconnection moment t∗ as ∼ |t − t∗|1/2.
The same scaling could be less rigorously predicted by
dimensional analysis assuming that the process of vortex
collision is mainly driven by topology of the order pa-
rameter, as was ﬁrst numerically veriﬁed for a BEC by
A. Villois et al. in [10] and later also by Galantucci et al.
in [11]. This assumption is justiﬁed for weakly interact-
ing BECs, where we have one-to-one mapping between
the order parameter and other characteristics such as ve-
locity ﬁeld or density distribution. In the recent Ref. [11]
the extensive simulations of the GPE also test the scaling
law at larger distances, where it changes to δ(t) ∼ |t−t∗|.
Since the scaling is also in agreement with experimental
measurements for superﬂuid helium [12] it is natural to
conjecture that the law should be universal.

Despite many experiments with topological defects in
ultracold gases of fermions [13–16], it has not been dis-
cussed whether or not the same scaling would be present
in Fermi superﬂuids. These systems can be tuned from
the BCS regime of weak attraction through the strongly

interacting gas (unitarity limit) to the BEC regime of
bosonic molecules, which is across the famous BCS-BEC
crossover [17]. Vortices in a Fermi gas have a more com-
plicated internal structure when compared to weakly in-
teracting BECs [18, 19], and a direct relation between the
order parameter and particle density or velocity ﬁeld is
lost. When introducing spin imbalance to the system, a
degree of freedom that is not accessible for BECs, the vor-
tex cores are ﬁlled by a surplus of the majority spin com-
ponent [20, 21]. Therefore, it is no longer obvious that
the simple square-root scaling postulated by dimensional
analysis for the BEC should be universal. In particular, it
was recently observed that the vortex core in a polarized
Fermi superﬂuid has a very rich structure due to the oc-
cupation of the Andreev states inside, and it can lead to
the reverse circulation in the core [22]. For larger spin po-
larization it is possible that the vortex is accompanied by
the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase [23]
In Fig. 1a we present conﬁguration with two perpendicu-
lar vortices immersed in a strongly interacting Fermi gas.
In the vicinity of one line (vertical), we applied an exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld to induce spin polarization of the core
p(r) = [n↑(r) − n↓(r)]/[n↑(r) + n↓(r)], where nσ stands
for the particle density with spin σ = {↑, ↓}. A priori
it is not even clear if the vortex reconnection for such
an exotic conﬁguration would take place, but our direct
numerical simulations (DNS) by means of density func-
tional theory clearly demonstrate that vortices undergo
a reconnection, as we present in Fig. 1c-e and in the data
shown in Fig. 2(b). Dynamics of the process is more com-
plicated as compared to one observed in BECs: before
the reconnection the vortices locally equilibrate via spin
tunneling process (Fig. 1c), and only then the exchange
of lines takes place. In this article we test universality
of the scaling law δ ∼ |t − t∗|1/2 across the whole BCS-
BEC crossover also allowing for eﬀects arising from spin
polarization. Due to the complexity of numerical simula-
tions we restrict ourselves to testing the said scaling only
for small distances between the vortex lines, where the
square-root dependence is expected to hold on the BEC

distribution function fβ(E) = 1/(exp(βE) + 1) is in-
troduced to model the temperature kBT = 1/β eﬀects
and in the calculations we set T → 0. Chemical poten-
tials µσ are used to control the particle numbers when

tions. These are obtained as self-consistent solutions of
a static variant of Eqs. (1). The particle densities are

On the other side of the resonance (1/kFa >

the attraction is strong enough to bind atoms with op-
posite spins into spinless dimers, which subsequently
condensate and form BEC: the Gross–Pitaevskii equa-
tion (GPE) becomes reliable in this regime. Here we
used both the standard and the reﬁned formulation of
the GPE, known as the Extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF)
model which take into account that dimers consist of two
atoms of the fermionic type [25–27]:

and density is related to the condensate wave function
as n = 2|Ψ|2. The extra factors of two appearing in
the density deﬁnition, in the denominator of the kinetic

a composite structure of a dimer, which consist of two
fermionic particles. The interaction term arises as a
functional derivative of the density functional EETF =

Close to the resonance (1/kFa ≈ 0) strong quantum
correlations dominate and the system forms the unitary

The model— A straightforward approach to accurately
model the dynamics across the BCS-BEC crossover is to
implement appropriate methods dedicated to each of the
interaction regimes. It is convenient to parametrize the
interaction strength via dimensionless quantity 1/akF,
where a is an s-wave scattering length and kF =
(3π2n)1/3 is a Fermi wave vector corresponding to the
total density n. The BCS side of the resonance (1/kFa <

−1) corresponds to weak interactions where fermions
with opposite spins form Cooper pairs. This is the regime
of applicability of the mean-ﬁeld Bogoliubov-de Gennes
(BdG) equations, which deﬁne the evolution of quasipar-
ticle wave functions (uη(r, t), vη(r, t))T :

a)-e) we show the minimal distance as a function of time to reconnection before (empty symbols) and after (full symbols) the
collision for various polarizations and values of 1/kF a. The solid lines show ﬁts of the data to the relation in Eq. 6. The ﬁtted
exponents are close to 1/2 (marked by a dashed line) and have been measured as: (a) 0.51, 0.53; (b) 0.48, 0.47, 0.53, 0.51,

data sets are in diﬀerent colour (or grayscale) and with diﬀerent symbols. In panels f) and g) we show the vortex conﬁguration
shortly before and shortly after the reconnection event, respectively for the unpolarized Fermi gas at unitarity. The color code
(or grayscale) along the vortex line corresponds to its curvature and the arrows show tangent vectors to the vortex lines at the
points of minimal distance. In panel h) we plot the expression tan(φ/2)A+/A−, where φ is the angle between the asymptotes
of the hyperbolae formed by the lines at the same time t before and after the reconnection. We show three data sets, two for
the UFG and one in the BCS regime.

strongly correlated regime [24, 28, 29]. The ASLDA ap-
proach utilizes concepts of density functional theory and
overcomes deﬁciencies of the BdG approach when applied
to strongly interacting systems. At a formal level time-
dependent ASLDA equations have the same structure as
Eqs (1) and (2), where the single-particle Hamiltonian
and the pairing ﬁeld are given by (in order to simplify
the notation we omit the position and time dependence
of the densities):

Here Uσ(n↑, n↓, ν) is a Hartree-Fock term which models
the eﬀects of strong interactions. Moreover, the pairing
ﬁeld ∆(n↑, n↓, ν) depends on both particle densities and
the anomalous density. In turn the ASLDA approach in-
troduces additional coupling between the density modes
and pairing modes, which is not present at the BdG level.
Coupling constant γ and further couplings entering the
Hartree-Fock terms were tuned to provide a remarkable
agreement with the quantum Monte Carlo calculations
for both uniform and trapped systems at unitarity. For

the explicit form of the single-particle Hamiltonian and
the pairing ﬁeld see section 9.3 in [17]. In the calcula-
tions presented here we forced the eﬀective mass m∗ to
be equal the the bare mass m in order to speed up our
calculations. This modiﬁcation does not induce any qual-
itative changes, and only quantitative modiﬁcation at a
level of a few percent is generated, see the Supplementary
Material of [27].

Numerical procedure— Direct numerical simulations with
all three approaches were executed on a 3D spatial grid
of size 643 with a lattice spacing in the range dx/ξ ∈
(1.75, 2.5) when measured in units of coherence length
ξ. We have tested that lattice of this size is suﬃcient
to reproduce the scaling law δ ∼ |t − t∗|1/2 for BEC
regime with reasonable accuracy, in accordance with pre-
vious studies [11]. Tests with relatively low computa-
tionally demanding GPE also showed that increasing the
grid size to 2563 does not change the results qualita-
tively. Studies are conducted in the zero temprature
limit. Spatial derivatives were calculated using spectral
methods, by means of Fourier transforms. Static BdG
and ASLDA equations are solved by a series of succes-
sive diagonalizations of the Hamiltonian matrix (2) un-
til self-consistence. Static solution for the ETF model

was generated by means of imaginary time projection
method and for time dependent problems we used the
Adams-Bashforth-Moulton (predictor-corrector) scheme
of the ﬁfth order as the integrator. More details on the
implementation can be found in Refs. [29, 32].

Lattice formulation imposes periodic boundary condi-
tions. In order to get rid of the interaction of vortices
with their own images we introduced potential walls at
the borders. We choose the potential to vary smoothly
from zero in the bulk region to a ﬁnite value close to the
boundary, so that all the derivatives are continuous. To
this end we chose the potential at a single boundary of
the form:

Vext(x) = V0






s(x − l, w, α)

x ≤ l
l < x ≤ l + w
x ≥ l + w

(3)

where w is the width of the transient regime where Vext
has an intermediate value, and l is the width measured
from the box center where Vext = 0. The function
s(x, w, α) has the form

s(x, w, α) =

The total external potential is a sum of all such poten-
tial contributions for every wall of the simulation cube.
In Fig. 3 we show a 3D visualization of the simulation
domain together with cross-sections demonstrating the
spatial distribution of selected quantities, for the case
corresponding to Fig. 1.

The protocol of our numerical experiments is the fol-
lowing: we start from initially straight, perpendicular
vortex lines, separated by a distance δ0, in order not to
favour either a parallel or antiparallel conﬁguration. The
starting point is obtained by imprinting the phase pat-
tern of the order parameter (superﬂuid gap ∆ for the
Fermi superﬂuid or condensate’s wave function Ψ for the
condensate of dimers) and subsequently allowing the sys-
tem to ﬁnd the lowest energy state corresponding to this
topological constraint.
In the case of a UFG or BCS
regimes, this corresponds to iterating of the BdG and
ASLDA equations until self-consistency is achieved, and
in the case of the condensate of dimers it corresponds to
the imaginary time evolution of the GPE. Next, we allow
the system to evolve in time by executing time dependent
variants of the methods. In the presented data sets, the
vortex lines undergo a reconnection, which is preceded by
the lines bending towards each other around the points
where the reconnection will take place. After the recon-
nection the vortex lines separate and move apart, see
visualization in Fig. 1c-f. Finally, we extract the vortex
lines from the data sets as a sequence of coordinates and
analyze the dynamics of these lines.
In particular, we
measure the minimal distance δ(t) between the lines as
they approach the reconnection and the tangent vectors
of the vortex lines. The reconnection time t∗ has to be
extrapolated, and we adopt two approaches: ﬁrst we es-
timate the reconnection time as the weighted average of

distance δ: t∗ = (δ−t+ + δ+t−)/(δ− + δ+), where (−)
refers to the earlier point in time and (+) to the later
point. Second, we estimate the same reconnection time
by ﬁtting the linear function δ(t)2 = a±t + b± to both
data sets before (−) and after (+) the provisionally cho-
sen reconnection time, where we take only a restricted
number of data points on each side. Then the reconnec-
tion time is estimated as: t∗ = −(b+ − b−)/(a+ − a−).
Both approaches provide estimates of t∗ wich are in good
agreement.

where (r, ϕ, z) are cylindrical coordinates of point r.
Then, the quasiparticle wave functions have a well de-
ﬁned angular momentum m = <vη| ˆLz|vη>
<vη|vη> . In the context
of the investigation of the impact of the internal vortex
structure on the reconnection dynamics it is important
to have a correct representation of the states inside the
vortex core. This is related to the question of a required
lattice resolution. In Fig. 4 we present numerically ex-
tracted values of the expectation values of the angular
momentum of ˆLz for a vortex state solution with re-
spect to the lattice resolution. The most important are
states inside the pairing gap ∆, called Andreev states,
since they give rise to non-zero density inside vortices
in fermionic systems. We ﬁnd that for lattice resolution
ξ/dx >
∼ 1.7 the numerically represented wave functions
have a well-deﬁned angular momentum: the deviation of
<vη| ˆLz|vη>
<vη|vη> from the nearest integer value is no more than

0.01.

Figure 4. Expectation values of the angular momentum of
ˆLz for states residing in the paring gap ∆ for vortex solution
in a unitary Fermi gas (ASLDA method). Calculations were
done for lattice of the same size as used for the reconnection
studies (643). The resolution ξ/dx >
∼ 1.7 is required to obtain
correct numerical representation of the Andreev states. For
lower lattice resolution, for example ξ/∆x = 1.3, deviations
from the integer value for the angular momentum are clearly
visible.

For extracting the positions of the vortices we used the
algorithm presented in [30], with the modiﬁcation that in-
stead of searching for zeros in the paring ﬁeld/condensate
wave function, we were searching for points around which
its phase has a non-zero winding number. This modiﬁca-
tion greatly improves the stability of the tracking algo-
rithm for the cases of BdG and ASLDA calculations. The
algorithm searches for the vortex lines’ positions with
subgrid resolution and the precision of extracting the po-

sitions of individual lines was estimated to be 0.2dx and
the accuracy of the measurement of relative distance is
∆δ ≈ 0.46 dx.
Results— Numerical results for the minimal distance δ(t)
are tested against their compatibility with the formula

δ(t) = A±|t − t∗|α±

(6)

where the ﬁtting coeﬃcients A and α are allowed to
be diﬀerent before (−) and after (+) the reconnection.
In Fig. 2c-e we present numerically extracted values of
δ(t) for systems being in the three regimes: BCS regime
(1/kF a = −1.1), unitary regime (1/kF a = 0) and BEC
regime (1/kF a = +1.2). In these runs we imposed the
system to be spin-symmetric, i.e number of spin-up N↑
and spin-down N↓ particles are equal. For better visi-
bility, the distance between the reconnecting points as a
function of the time to the reconnection event is plotted
in the logarithmic scale together with the slope corre-
sponding to ∼ t1/2. For the BEC regime (panel e) the
results for a lattice of size 643 and 2563 are provided and
demonstrate robustness of our results with respect to the
lattice size. In the plot referring to the unitary regime
(panel d) we show the results for diﬀerent temporal and
spatial resolutions. Clearly, there is no qualitative change
between these two data sets. In most cases, we observe
that the separation of the vortex lines is faster than their
approach before the collision, and this is reﬂected in the
coeﬃcient A± in front of the Eq. (6). This ﬁnding is con-
sistent with the recent work, Ref. [31]. The exponent in
the power law arising from the ﬁtting procedure remains
close to α± ≈ 1/2. Reduced chi-square statistics for de-
viations from the expected law |t − t∗|1/2 stays below
one for each case, conﬁrming compatibility. The ﬁtted
exponents are summarized in the table I. In the supple-
mental material [33] we provide a list of movies with the
visualization for each case.

The tests are supplemented by runs for spin imbal-
anced systems N↑ > N↓, see Figs 2a-b, with the same
conclusions as for the spin-symmetric cases. Also an ex-
otic case, where only one vortex line drags the polar-
ization has been considered, as shown on Fig. 1, and it
also exhibits postulated scaling. The imbalanced runs
were realized by imposing diﬀerence of chemical poten-
tials between spin-components h = (µ↑ − µ↓)/2 in BdG
and ASLDA equations. The diﬀerence is kept below the
Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit h < ∆ (where ∆ stands
for the superﬂuid gap) in order not to destroy the su-
perﬂuidity in the bulk and, at the same time, it is large
enough to generate signiﬁcant polarization p of the vortex
cores.

Finally, we are interested in the geometry of colliding
vortex lines, and to this end we calculate the tangent
vectors along the lines. Motivated by the theory pre-
sented in Ref. [10] and simulations for the BEC therein,
we want to check if the reconnection is always between
the locally antiparallel segments of the vortex lines, and
to test the relation tan φ/2 = A−/A+ (assuming the ex-
ponent α± = 1/2 is the same before and after the recon-

between the asymptotes of the hyperbolae formed by vor-
tex lines before and after the collision, see Figs 2f-g. In
panel (h) the expression A+ tan(φ/2)/A−, which is ex-
pected to be one for the reconnection, is plotted against
the time to the reconnection. We conﬁrm that the val-
ues are approaching one as the time to the reconnection
decreases.
Conclusions— In conclusion, we extended the analysis of
the reconneting vortex lines to the wide range of physical
systems and observe a similar behaviour as was predicted,
simulated and observed for the weakly interacting BECs.
As a result of the analysis, the scaling of the distance

function of time in the form δ(t) ∼ |t − t∗|1/2 can be
regarded as universal and conforms to predictions from
simpliﬁed theoretical models. This universality can be

attributed to the mechanism of the reconnection which is
primarily driven by the topology (phase) of these defects,
which is universal for all superﬂuids.
