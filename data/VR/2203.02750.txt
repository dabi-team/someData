On Rotation Gains Within and Beyond
Perceptual Limitations for Seated VR

Abstract—Head tracking in head-mounted displays (HMDs) enables users to explore a 360-degree virtual scene with free head
movements. However, for seated use of HMDs such as users sitting on a chair or a couch, physically turning around 360-degree is not
possible. Redirection techniques decouple tracked physical motion and virtual motion, allowing users to explore virtual environments
with more ﬂexibility. In seated situations with only head movements available, the difference of stimulus might cause the detection
thresholds of rotation gains to differ from that of redirected walking. Therefore we present an experiment with a two-alternative
forced-choice (2AFC) design to compare the thresholds for seated and standing situations. Results indicate that users are unable to
discriminate rotation gains between 0.89 and 1.28, a smaller range compared to the standing condition. We further treated head
ampliﬁcation as an interaction technique and found that a gain of 2.5, though not a hard threshold, was near the largest gain that users
consider applicable. Overall, our work aims to better understand human perception of rotation gains in seated VR and the results
provide guidance for future design choices of its applications.

1 INTRODUCTION

V irtual reality (VR) technology has developed signif-

icantly over recent years, providing immersive vir-
tual environments (VEs) for various applications includ-
ing games, training, and rehabilitation [57]. Consumer-level
head-mounted displays (HMDs) such as HTC Vive, Valve
Index, Oculus Quest, equipped with accurate head and
body tracking techniques, enable users to explore virtual
scenes more freely than ever before. However, realistic
physical movements are still a fundamental concern in VR,
which has been proven to be essential for understanding
and interacting with VEs [41], [56]. The most common way
is a one-to-one mapping that alters the virtual position in
the exactly same manner as real ones. Although providing
a high level of consistency and naturalness [3], it is not the
desired way in many VR situations. Recovering movements
in ﬁdelity might not be possible due to the absence of large
physical space. More importantly, VR is increasingly used
for home and public entertainment purposes covering a
wider range of users, in which scenarios users are mostly
seated and prefer more convenient and relaxed interactions
while excess body movements might be tiring and un-
comfortable. Existing surveys also demonstrate that sitting
provides more comfort and causes fewer safety concerns in
leaning-based interfaces [68].

This motivates research into techniques that facilitate
users to explore and navigate the VE when being seated.
Classical methods include steering with directions given
by gaze, torso or upper body [67], walk-in-space tech-
niques [66] or manipulation with hand-based input devices,
but still requires a swivel chair for 360-degree viewing. An-
other solution is to utilize modiﬁed interaction techniques
for better travel and view control, speciﬁcally redirection
techniques. Based primarily on the visual dominance effect
[7], these works manipulate the mapping between physical
movements and virtual ones. For instance, redirected walk-
ing [42], [52] allows users to explore virtual worlds that
are much larger than the actual physical space by slightly
bending the walking path without being noticed. In terms
of head movements, users can view a 360-degree virtual
scene with much less head motion with ampliﬁed head
rotation [22], [29], [41], [46], which also provides higher-
ﬁdelity control than joystick or mouse techniques. However,
unsuitable ampliﬁcation factors have been found to damper
task performance and introduce sickness [41], [46].

Obviously, head rotations cannot be changed in an ar-
bitrary way. Previous works have estimated the detection
thresholds (the range within which users cannot detect the
manipulation of a certain redirection technique) of several
types of gains for redirected walking [4], [53]. During their
experiment for estimating rotation gains, either in-place or
during walking, users can turn their bodies freely when
moving their heads. However, in seated situations such as
non-turning chairs and sofas, although upper body move-
ment is available, people may prefer only to rotate their
heads as it potentially offers a more convenient and comfort-
able experience. We thus revisit the problem of estimating
the range of imperceptible rotation gains for seated VR,
ﬁrst studied by [21], with modern hardware and controlled
upper body motion. In addition, previous work found that

 
 
 
 
 
 
JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015

rotation gains within the upper detection thresholds are
generally less than 1.5 (e.g. results in [53], [62]) and far from
sufﬁcient for 360-degree exploration for stationary use. Also,
while overt manipulation has already been studied in head
rotation, researchers have not well-explored users’ subjec-
tive preferences to those large gains and how strong a user
might be manipulated. This necessitates further research
into the understanding of rotation gains beyond perceptual
limitations.

Therefore, our research focuses on answering the follow-

ing questions:

• Q1: What are the detection thresholds of rotation

gains for seated VR restricted to head motion only?

• Q2: To what extent can users accept gains larger than

the detection threshold when seated?

In this paper, we address the above questions with two
user studies. The ﬁrst study is a psychophysical experiment
utilizing a two-alternative forced-choice methodology and
estimating detection thresholds of rotation gains in seated
VR with psychometric functions. We conﬁrmed that com-
pared to the standing condition, people are even more
sensitive to manipulations while seated. To bridge the gap
between imperceptible gains and real-world applications,
we further investigate whether gains beyond the threshold
can be tolerated. Therefore, in the second study, we use a set
of applicability items including naturalness, and sickness
and asked participants to give their subjective ratings that
were later used for comparison between different levels of
gains. We revealed that most participants thought gains
up to 2.5 were practical for usage. Our ﬁndings provide
valuable insights and open up further research directions
for seated VR applications.

2 RELATED WORK
Our work builds on previous research about natural and
semi-natural navigation in VR and human perception of
them. In this section, we provide an overview of current
advances on redirection techniques, threshold detection, as
well as how our research relates to them.

2.1 Redirection Techniques

Redirection techniques have to date been investigated in
many situations such as redirected walking [42], [43], [51],
[52], hand remapping and redirected touching [1], [10],
[25], [33], [63], jumping [17], [32] and head rotations [46],
[51]. The main goal of these techniques is to overcome the
problems of limited space or physical incapabilities [58]. If
only one-to-one mapping is employed, users’ walking will
be constrained by the room space and arm reach by their
arm length.

Redirected walking (RDW), proposed by Razzaque et
al. [42], is a common locomotion technique for natural
traveling in VEs without joystick controls. Rotations and
translations are applied imperceptibly so that users adjust
their movements to walk along a curved physical path
as if to move on a virtual straight line. The ratio of al-
tered position and tracked physical position is deﬁned as
gain [53] or control/display ratio [12]. Langbehn et al. [27]
suggested that RDW also enabled users to walk on already

2

curved paths and introduced the concept of bending gain.
Researchers later investigated how to make RDW more
applicable in various ways. Razzaque et al. [43] exam-
ined redirection in CAVE-like environments that are not
equipped with 360-degree screens. Their method allowed
users to virtually move around without facing the missing
back wall, which was achieved by gradually rotating the
virtual scene towards the direction of the front screen. Seven
League Boots [20] instead ampliﬁed movements considering
both user gaze direction and travel direction to increase
walking distance. Studies also devised RDW algorithms for
gymnasium-sized spaces [18]. To encourage users to steer
towards predeﬁned locations, guidance ﬁelds [55] could
be used. Additionally, the reorientation process could be
less obvious to users when distractors were placed in the
VE [39].

However, physical walking is not always possible, in
many VR applications the user is seated or standing with
only head and upper body motion available. Recently,
novel techniques were proposed to tackle this issue, i.e.
manipulation of lateral camera motion in response to the
corresponding head motion in VR [49], or translating the
motion of in-place pedaling to virtual walking [14]. Other
researched approaches include hand and head redirection
techniques [8], [12], [16], [25], [30], [40]. Highly related to
our work is redirected head rotation, especially for seated
VR. This can be done through head scrolling as introduced
in [66] where virtual scenes would rotate towards the center
view when the head rotation angle surpassed a predeter-
mined threshold. Norouzi et al. [36] further extended it
by using eye movements to control the virtual view angle.
Another line of work is redirected head movements with
ampliﬁed head rotations that introduce less sickness than
scrolling [28]. Head rotations are ampliﬁed using an ampli-
ﬁcation factor (or rotation gains) to allow viewing for a large
range with relatively small physical turns. Le Ngoc et al. [29]
explored rotation ampliﬁcation for ﬂight simulation and
concluded that no signiﬁcant extra workload or simulator
sickness would be induced. Jay et al. [22] demonstrated that
ampliﬁed head rotation even improved the performance of
visual search tasks. Freitag et al. [13] detected no signiﬁcant
negative effect of rotation gains on simulator sickness and
presence in CAVE systems but found evidence of reduced
spatial knowledge. Further experiments that compared four
levels of ampliﬁcation factors in both CAVE and HMD sys-
tems were conducted by Ragan et al. [41]. Although the per-
formance on search tasks was not affected by ampliﬁcation,
they found obvious sickness problems and worse spatial
orientation with large rotation gains. Instead of using a
constant mapping, rotation gains can be altered dynamically
without being noticed by users [64]. Langbehn et al. [28]
showed that dynamic gains caused less sickness and had
higher usability. Zhang et al. [65] designed a velocity-guided
ampliﬁcation function that outperformed linear mapping on
visual searching and counting tasks. Sargunam et al. [46]
combined dynamically ampliﬁed and guided head rotations
that allowed a full 360-degree virtual range exploration with
comfortable physical rotation, whose rotation adjustments
resembled those used in washout ﬁlters for motion simula-
tion [19], [59].

Although previous works enhanced user experience or

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015

facilitated performance, there is generally a lack of under-
standing of how much rotation gain is imperceptible or
applicable for seated VR. Rotation gains for RDW provide
a reasonable reference, but considering the ﬂexibility differ-
ence between the two, a comparison of them will certainly
provide precious information for devising ampliﬁcation
techniques for seated VR applications.

2.2 Detection Thresholds

Redirection techniques cannot be applied without consid-
eration of magnitude, therefore studies have applied psy-
chophysical methods to determine detection thresholds. The
methodology widely used recently is to present participants
a certain level of stimuli in each trial and force them to
choose from two options (i.e., Was the virtual movement
larger or smaller than the physical movement?). The propor-
tion of correct answers for each level is then calculated and
ﬁtted to a psychometric function. Based on this, detection
thresholds can then be estimated. This procedure is typically
called 2AFC and employed in a lot of previous literature
that also focuses on threshold estimation of redirection
techniques
[1], [10], [37], [53], [63]. Grechkin et al. [15]
proposed to name it pseudo-2AFC since only one stimulus
is presented in each trial but in our paper we still follow the
terminology 2AFC.

Estimating rotation gains in redirected walking has been
well studied. Steinicke et al. [53] found a detection threshold
for rotation gains for redirected walking between 0.64 and
1.24 (lower and upper bound) by 2AFC. Bruder et al. [4]
reported similar gains at 0.68 and 1.26. The same authors [5]
detected no signiﬁcant differences in 13 participants be-
tween two gender groups, 0.69 and 1.19 for men, 0.66 to
1.26 for women. Other researchers estimated rotation gains
with varying experimental conditions. Paludan et al. [38]
studied threshold gains in the presence of 4 objects and
16 objects and found values at 0.81 - 1.19 and 0.82 - 1.20
respectively. When visual cues were presented, thresholds
for rotation gain with or without audio were revealed are
similar [35]. Seraﬁn et al. [48] estimated detection thresholds
to be at 0.28 to 1.2 with only auditory stimuli and Freitag et
al. [13] derived thresholds from 0.85 to 1.18 for CAVE-like
environments. Williams and Peck [62] investigated rotation
gains considering FOV, gender and distractors. Recently,
thresholds under controlled rotational speeds were also
tested and participants were less sensitive to rotation gains
with decreased rotational motion [6].

In the context of rotation gains for seated conditions,
Jaekl et al. [21] ﬁrst conducted experiments that asked
seated participants to adjust rotation gains by a step of 0.05
until the VE was stable. They found detection thresholds
for the yaw axis of 0.88 and 1.33 in a 10 participants
experiment. Jerald et al. [23] reported 2D scenes presented
by a screen can be rotated up to 11.2% with the direction
of head rotation and 5.2% against the direction of head
rotation in a seated setting. Bruder et al. [4] also conducted
experiments for seated conditions and reported gains of 0.77
to 1.26. However, their experiments required participants to
sit on a rotatable wheelchair and use joysticks for initiating
rotations and they might get proprioceptive cues from their
hands in this way. Our work resembles the work of Jaekl et

al. [21] as we also measure seated rotation gains but differs
in the aspect that our experiment requires users to rotate
their heads without upper body movement, which is not
explicitly controlled in their work [21].

2.3 Overt Manipulation

According to Suma et al. [54], redirection techniques can
be classiﬁed as overt and subtle in terms of noticeability
to users. While subtle methods have the beneﬁt of being
less noticeable, they have limited potential to improve the
overall user experience (i.e. reduce the physical movement
to a considerable amount). This can be achieved by overt
manipulation such as teleportation, resetting [61], or use
of perceptible gains. Rietzler et al. [45] conﬁrmed that
users could accept curvature gains far beyond perceptual
thresholds in RDW. Simeone et al. [50] designed another
overt walking technique in the context of room-scale VR,
which was faster and preferable than compared techniques.
Concurrently, Telewalk [44] combined observable transla-
tion and curvature gains to allow endless virtual walking
along a real-world path with a pre-deﬁned radius. However,
these techniques might break the sense of presence and
introduce extra motion sickness. Furthermore, Schmitz et
al. [47] studied the amount of rotation gain that reduces self-
reported presence through a search and collect task. They
showed that rotation gains above detection thresholds still
allow providing immersive experiences.

For seated VR, rotation gains within the detection thresh-
old are not sufﬁcient for 360-degree virtual viewing, since
head rotation of at most 90 degrees is available [28]. Many
existing head ampliﬁcation techniques can be seen as overt,
where they either use a large rotation gain constantly [26],
[28], [41] or in part of the remapping curve [28], [46]. As
reported by Ragan et al. [41], noticeable problems were
identiﬁed with an ampliﬁcation factor of 4. Inspired by these
studies, we aim to determine the threshold that users are
aware of but still ﬁnd acceptable to use.

3 EXPERIMENT 1: ROTATION GAIN THRESHOLDS

The goal of the ﬁrst experiment is to determine the detection
thresholds of rotation gains when users are seated restricted
to head movements only. Before starting the experiments
and analyzing the rotation gains, we were interested in
estimating the angles that users feel comfortable in such a
scenario.

When users are stationary seated, the largest physical
angle that they can perform without twisting their body
both on the left and right side is less than 90◦ [28]. However,
we were interested to determine the angle that they feel
comfortable with, which we anticipate to be smaller. We
deﬁne this angle as the maximum comfortable rotation angle. In
order to quantify this angle, we conducted a pilot study. We
asked 10 participants (6 male and 4 female, mean age 21.7) to
rotate their heads to the maximum comfortable rotation an-
gle using a VR headset. We asked them to perform this task
three times both in the left and right direction and captured
the angle from the headset sensors. We then calculated the
averages for the maximum comfortable rotation angle for
left 62.5◦ (SD = 9.6) left and for right 61.6◦ (SD = 10.8) (Fig.

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015
1). Values ranged from 43◦ to 76◦, with 6 participants’ angles
were in the range of 60◦ to 70◦. This indicates that many
users prefer smaller head movements than what they are
physically capable of. Note that measures including wearing
masks, cleaning the equipment before and after experiments
and keeping a safe social distance were taken to prevent the
spread of COVID-19 in all the experiments in this paper.

angle, which is less than 90 degrees in both directions.

3.1 Experiment Design

The main goal of this experiment is to estimate the detection
thresholds of rotation gains in a seated scenario. For the ex-
periment, we deployed a 2AFC task during which a random
gain was applied constantly in each trial and the yaw axis of
the head rotation in the VR HMD was ampliﬁed accordingly.
The forced-choice aims to avoid bias because when subjects
do not know the answer, they will have a probability of 50%
to be correct [53]. The rotation angle in the real world was
randomized between 60◦ and 70◦ with an average rotation
angle of 65◦ to conﬁne the movement close to most users’
maximum comfortable rotation angle. We did not include
angles less than 60 since participants were not able to notice
if angles were lower within 10 degrees. The rotation also
would be not enough and required more turn around.

The experiment contains two blocks: seated and standing
which only differ in the posture during the rotation and the
order of blocks were counterbalanced between participants.
In the seated block, participants only rotated their heads,
while in the standing block they could move their bodies
freely. Rotation gains ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 with steps of
0.1 were included. Each gain was repeated six times and
participants had to ﬁnish a total of 4 random practice trials
+ 11 gains × 6 repeats = 70 trials in both blocks. The trial
ordering was randomized for each participant. Answers and
response times (from the time the question was shown to
the time they made the selection) of the participants were
logged for analysis.

For each trial, participants rotated their heads in the
direction of a virtual arrow that appeared at the center of
their vision. They rotated until hitting a red cylinder, indi-
cating that they should turn their heads backward till they
noticed another cylinder at the center of their vision. Then,
they needed to rotate to the neutral position and the trial
was ﬁnished. The experiment design allowed participants
to experience enough virtual rotation and avoided head
strain since the maximum angle was 70◦ and the ﬁnal head
rotation angle was close to zero.

Once a trial ended, the HMD would fade to light navy
and participants were prompted with the question “Was
the virtual movement smaller or greater than the physical
movement?” (smaller, greater) and had to submit their
answer with a hand controller. After making the choice,
they needed to select the “Next” option in the scene to
proceed. The virtual environment in the next trial would be
rotated at a random angle to avoid familiarization with the
orientation. If a break was needed, “Next” should remain
unselected before the experiment resumed. To avoid pos-
sible distractions or hints, the arrow and cylinders would
disappear after participants started to rotate in the right
direction. Participants were encouraged to rotate with a
normal speed without overshooting the cylinder position.
The accuracy of their response was not given in any trial.

The virtual scene consisted of a city block with blue sky,
grasses, trees, roads and buildings with different colors. The
participant was positioned at a lane and in the center of the
buildings. The environment had rich textures and realistic
shadows that provided sufﬁcient optical ﬂow when users
rotated their heads (See Fig. 2 for the virtual scene and an
exemplar process of a trial).

3.2 Apparatus

We used an Oculus Quest 2 headset with the default 6DOF
position and orientation tracking system, as well as the
right-hand controller since all participants chose to use their
right hands to answer the questions. The interpupillary
distance (IPD) of the HMD (3 levels for Oculus Quest 2)
was calibrated for each participant to avoid that the display
was blurry. The system has around 110◦ diagonal FOV, a
90Hz refresh rate and a 1832 × 1920 resolution per eye. The
software was developed using Unity3D 2020.3.12f1c1 64bit
(with Oculus Integration plugin). During the experiment,
the headset was connected to a desktop computer with a
cable which was long enough to not hamper movement, so
the experimenter was able to monitor the virtual scene mir-
rored on the computer display. Ambient background sounds
were played to avoid the orientation cues introduced by
real-world sounds. For the seated block, participants sat
on a non-rotating chair with little movements of the upper
body. For the standing block, participants stood in-place and
rotated their heads and upper bodies freely. The setup is
shown in Fig. 3.

responses to different levels of stimulus [60]. The gain at
which users respond “greater” with half probability is called
the point of subjective equality (PSE), which means they
cannot detect stimulus at this level. Detection thresholds
were the gains where participants have 25 percent and
75 percent possibilities to give the response of “greater”,
manipulations in between were considered imperceptible
to users. We used quickpsy [31] (version 0.1.5.1), an R
package to perform data analysis that uses the following
psychometric function:

ψ(x; γ, λ, α, β) = γ + (1 − γ − λ) ∗ F (x; α, β)

(1)

where γ and λ are the guess rate and the lapse rate that
adjusts leftward and rightward asymptotes and can be set
to zero if probabilities are close to zero near x = 0.0 and x =
1.0 [1]. F (x; α, β) denotes a sigmoidal-shape function with
asymptotes at 0 and 1. The choice of F has little impact on
threshold calculation [31], thus we adopted the cumulative
normal distribution function as in [10], [62]:

where α represents PSE and β its standard deviation respec-
tively. Three participants with a probability of ﬁt less than
0.05 were considered to have a bad ﬁt and were excluded
from data analysis. Gains at the 25%, PSE and 75% were
calculated. Fig. 4 shows the ﬁtted curves and thresholds. We
observed a goodness of ﬁt of the psychometric function of
p = 0.85 for seated, and p = 0.99 for standing.

for each tested gain and the ﬁtted psychometric curve (error bar shows
one standard error). The left and right edges of the colored region show
the 25% and 75% detection thresholds.

From the psychometric function, we found a bias for
PSE at 1.09 and 1.10 for the seated and the standing block
respectively, meaning that most users tend to overestimate
head rotations (See Table 1 for individual results). The 25%
and 75% threshold is 0.89 and 1.28 for the seated block, a
smaller range than for the standing block (0.80 and 1.40).
We further compared the thresholds with a 2 genders × 2
blocks ANOVA. Results demonstrated a signiﬁcant effect of
block, both in 25% threshold (F (1, 18) = 12.015, p = 0.003)
and 75% threshold (F (1, 18) = 6.666, p = 0.019), and no
interaction effect was found. This indicates that people are
more sensitive to lower and upper bounds of detection

seated block (right).

3.3 Participants
20 subjects, age 19-25, including 10 male (M = 21.6, SD =
2.17) and 10 female (M = 21.3, SD = 2.26) successfully
accomplished the study, 3 additional participants ﬁnished
the experiment but were excluded from data analysis (See
Sec. 3.5). Most of them were students or members from the
campus and had diverse backgrounds. All participants had
a normal or corrected-to-normal vision (13 wear glasses or
contact lenses) and were physically and mentally healthy for
the experiment. 4 participants had multiple VR experiences
before, 8 had experienced some VR before, and 8 had never
experienced VR.

3.4 Procedure

Upon their arrival at the lab, participants ﬁlled in a con-
sent form and a demographic questionnaire (age, gender,
amount of prior experience with VR). Each of them received
$20 for compensation. Then the experimenter explained the
goal and task of the experiment. Participants either started
with the standing or seated block after the experimenter
helped them adjust and put on the HMD. At the beginning
of a block, four practice trials were included for participants
to get familiar with the process during which they were
allowed to ask questions. Afterwards, they began to repeat
the remaining formal trials with head rotation and 2AFC
selection. Participants were allowed to take a short break
after each trial that lasted no longer than three minutes.
After completing all trials of the ﬁrst block, they would
have a 10-minute compulsory break and then proceed
to the second block. A Kennedy-Lane Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire (SSQ) [24] was completed before and after
each block. The entire procedure took about 90-100 minutes
including explanation, trials, breaks and questionnaires.

3.5.2 Response Time

With the logged response time for each trial, we removed
outliers following the 1.5 interquartile rule and boxplotted
the data (See Fig. 5). On average, participants reacted timely
and gave their answers within four seconds. Times were
the longest with gains at 1.0 and 1.1, which indicates that
they caused confusion to users. On the other hand, it took
the shortest time for participants to decide at gains 1.5. We
performed a comparison of response time with an ANOVA
considering 11 gains × 2 genders × 2 blocks. There were
signiﬁcant main effects of gain (F (10, 180) = 3.611, p <
0.001) and block (F (1, 18) = 7.458, p = 0.014), a trending
effect of gender (F (1, 18) = 3.950, p = 0.062). There is also
an interaction effect between gender and gain (F (10, 180) =
2.345, p = 0.013).

3.5.3 Simulator Sickness

In order to measure simulator sickness, we calculated the
SSQ total severity (TS) score. We measured a mean SSQ-
score of 6.36 (SD = 6.68) and 27.87 (SD = 29.26) be-
fore and after the seated block, 4.30 (SD = 4.52) and
30.48 (SD = 32.00) before and after the standing block.
A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the data was
not normally distributed. We analyzed the results with
a Wilcoxon signed-rank test at the 5% signiﬁcance level
and found that the SSQ score was signiﬁcantly higher
after experiencing the seated block (p = 0.0004) and the
standing block (p = 0.0003). ANOVA found no signiﬁcant
effect of block (F (1, 18) = 0.505, p = 0.486) or gender
(F (1, 18) = 1.199, p = 0.288) on the SSQ-score change as
well as any interaction effect (F (1, 18) = 0.554, p = 0.466).

3.6 Discussion

Our results indicate that participants are unable to dis-
criminate a real rotation deviating from a ﬁxed virtual
rotation of 90◦ between −11.8% and +22.0% while seated.
In the standing condition, real rotations can deviate between
−25.6% and +28.7%, which indicates that users are more
sensitive to rotation modiﬁcation in stationary conditions
with restricted body movements. The results are quite in-
teresting considering the movement cues that participants
received. In the seated block, they mainly relied on visual
information for the virtual environment, while for the real
world they sensed their head rotation through the vestibular
system and lacked proprioceptive cues from the upper body
compared to standing condition. If only vestibular and
visual cues were presented, the subordinate proprioceptive
cue is removed while the dominant cues remained (vestibu-
lar stimulation dominates over other sensory cues of motion
[2], [62]). It would be easier for users to tell the difference
between real and virtual motion with less conﬂict. On the
other hand, the relative movement between the head and
upper body in the seated block also makes real-world head
movements more palpable to participants.

Our thresholds for the standing condition are tighter
than those in Williams and Peck’s work [62] that also tested
on a 110◦ FOV. A possible reason is that for a fair compar-
ison, we set the same range of head rotation angles in both
blocks considering the maximum angles users could rotate
while seated. With limited head rotation, participants re-
ceived less proprioceptive cues than in previous work. This
also suggests that even when users stand, the manipulation
should be more conservative with applications that involve
mostly forward interactions.

The results in the seated block update the previous
ﬁndings under the condition of controlled upper body
movement by Jaekl et al. [21] using a state-of-the-art device.
Our experiment further reafﬁrms that there is a trade-off
between less physical movements and sense of naturalism.
With only head motion, the gains are more susceptible to be
noticed compared to standing. Therefore, HMD designers
and application developers need to be more cautious to
apply rotation gains in seated VR situations.

We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference between two gen-
ders as in [62]. However, the age range of male participants
in their experiment has much larger deviance. We cannot

rule out the possibility of age inﬂuencing detection thresh-
olds. The difference might also be explained by individual
differences. We found PSE varies largely among participants
(0.97 to 1.22 and 0.96 to 1.37 for seated and standing) and
the discrepancy [62] is even larger.

Head rotation within perceptual limitations allows users
to interact with virtual content naturally. However, accord-
ing to our results, the upper detection threshold for seated
VR is even smaller than previously estimated for redirected
walking. When being stationary seated, users can only ex-
plore 1.28 × 90 × 2 = 230 degrees even if they rotate their
head from −90 degree to 90 degree. This would be already
at their physical limit and much larger than their maximum
comfortable rotation angle, but still far from sufﬁcient for 360-
degree of free viewing.

4 EXPERIMENT 2: APPLICABILITY

In the previous section, we analyzed the thresholds for
detecting an ampliﬁed rotation. However, when looking
into aspects of applicability it is more important to explore
how a complete 360 scene with limited head motion can be
experienced. In this case, it is more reasonable to regard an
ampliﬁed head rotation as an interaction technique rather
than conﬁne it within the undetectable range. Earlier work
has demonstrated that rotations gain can be used beyond
perceptual limitations [28], [41], [46]. However, these works
performed either evaluation within a speciﬁc task or com-
parison with other non-linear mappings. Freitag et al. [13]
classiﬁed rotation gains into negligible, tolerable and unﬁt for
continuous use in CAVE system, which also motivates us to
explore user acceptance of rotation gains in sitting scenarios.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on users’
reactions to higher levels of gains and how much gain, even
if it can be noticed, could be accepted by users when they
are seated.

To address this gap, we designed and conducted our
second experiment. We used a set of items proposed by
Rietzler et al. [45] to measure the applicability of a gain.
The ﬁrst item is naturalness. It describes how much partic-
ipants feel the rotation has deviated from the most natural
mapping. The second item combines nausea and sickness
and reﬂects the assumption that high gain will possibly
introduce more sense of disorientation and motion sickness.
We decided against using comfort as an item as Rietzler et
al.’s results [45] in the boxplots showed that the distribution
of pleasant and applicable was highly consistent. Instead
we included physical movement as a third item since in
seated VR, the amount of physical movement required for
different gains have a great discrepancy. Note that physical
movement cannot be properly estimated from head rotation
data because users need to move their upper body at least
in a one-to-one mapping. The fourth item we used for
measuring applicability is applicability of a gain itself and
directly reﬂects users’ willingness to use a gain for seated
VR applications [45].

4.1 Design

In our experiment, we analyzed the preferences of users
towards rotation gains starting from 1.0 with a step of 0.5.

7

We set the upper bound to 3.5 by which users would only
need 51-degree head rotation for 180-degree viewing, an
angle smaller than the maximum comfortable rotation angle
of most users. We divided the experiment into two blocks
to investigate possible adaptation effects. We randomized
gains and tested twice in both blocks and participants had
to accomplish 2 practice + 2 blocks × 6 gains × 2 repeats =
26 trials.

One of the goals for our experiments was to make it
independent of a speciﬁc task avoiding that participants
might be inﬂuenced by task-speciﬁc actions and that the
results may fail to be generalized. Thus we used a 360-
degree free viewing task that did not include any time
pressure. We placed a white plate in the virtual world
located at 180-degree. Once hit by the user this would turn
to green. Each trial contained a 360 × 4 = 1440 virtual degree
rotation in a continuous process (See Fig. 6) and would
provide enough exposure for a certain gain. The virtual
rotation was the same for each gain for a fair comparison.
Participants initiated their head rotation with the direction
marked by an arrow until the plate appeared in the center of
their eyes. They then rotated in the opposite direction to hit
the plate again three times. Afterwards, they rotated back
to the neutral position and questions would be displayed.
We used a seven-point Likert scale questionnaire to collect
user feedback to the four statements listed below (1 means
totally disagree and 7 means totally agree).

• Rotating the head like this in a virtual world is

natural.

• Rotating the head like this in a virtual world requires

•

a lot of physical movements.
I have a strong feeling of nausea or sickness in the
trial.

• Rotating my head like this in a VE is applicable.

We did not explicitly control the head rotation speed of
participants but we suggested that participants rotate with
a normal and comfortable speed to see the scene clearly.
Furthermore, participants were told to not move their upper
body unless necessary (this happened at gains of 1.0 and
1.5 for most participants). A possible consideration is that
participants might infer the rotation gain from the position
of the plate, but it is less a problem. First, we did not point
out the exact virtual position of the plate in our instructions
and the virtual scene would be rotated in each trial, making
it hard to deduce how large the gain was. Second, the ques-
tion should be answered based on the subjective experience
during a trial regardless of the value of the gains.

4.2 Participants

We recruited 13 participants from the campus (mainly stu-
dents and employees of Tsinghua University, none of them
participated in the ﬁrst experiment). The participants were
aged between 19-27 (6 male and 7 female, mean age 21.3,
SD = 2.12) and all successfully accomplished the study.
All participants had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision
(9 wear glasses or contact lenses) and were physically and
mentally healthy. Among them, 3 were novice VR users who
never experienced VR before, 6 had at least some experience
with VR and 4 rated themselves as frequent VR users. 6 of
them reported extensive video game experience.

Fig. 6. The rotation process of the second experiment in the virtual
scene when the initial direction was left. Participants started from the
innermost half-circle, rotated in the direction of the start arrow, they
changed their directions when hitting the plate and rotated according
to the second smallest circle. They followed the same strategy for the
remaining circles. The pattern looks similar if the initial direction was
right.

4.3 Procedure

The apparatus was similar to the ﬁrst experiment. We
obtained informed consent from participants before the
beginning of the experiment. Each of them received $12 for
compensation. Then participants would be briefed about the
goal and the process of the experiment. The experimenter
later helped participants to adjust (the IPD and band length)
and to wear the HMD after they ﬁnished a demographic
survey and the SSQ questionnaire. Then two practice trials
would start after which participants could ask questions
about the procedure. After each trial, the four questions
mentioned above would be displayed and participants were
asked to answer them with a controller. We logged answers
for further analysis. All participants ﬁnished the experiment
with the Oculus Touch right-hand controller. Throughout
the experiment, we strongly advised participants to take
a 10-20 second break after any trial to mitigate the accu-
mulation of sickness. Participants could also choose to take
longer breaks up to two minutes. After the practice run,
the ﬁrst block would start. A 5-minute rest was enforced
between the ﬁrst and second block during which partici-
pants ﬁlled another SSQ. Afterward, they proceeded to the
second block. The third SSQ would be distributed once all
trials were completed. The entire procedure took about 60
minutes.

4.4 Results

We collected the results and further analyzed them using
the appropriate statistical tests.

4.4.1 Applicability items

A Friedman test indicated a statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ence in each of the items depending on the different gains
(Fig.7, χ2(5) = 55.752, p < 0.0001 for naturalness, χ2(5) =
61.991, p < 0.0001 for physical, χ2(5) = 34.068, p < 0.0001
for sickness, χ2(5) = 30.798, p < 0.0001 for applicable). We
further used a Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni

correction for multiple pairwise comparisons and reported
signiﬁcance at 5% level.

Naturalness. There were signiﬁcant differences between
1.0 and other gains (p < 0.01). Users could easily notice the
manipulation was beyond the threshold if the gain was not
1.0. We did not measure a signiﬁcant difference between 1.5
and 2.0 (p = 0.12), but naturalness continued to diminish
signiﬁcantly when compared both of them with gains larger
than 2.0 (p < 0.05).

Physical. Similar to naturalness, the physical movement
answers between a gain of 1.0 and others were signiﬁcantly
different (p < 0.001 for all tests). For seated VR, gains
equal or greater than 1.5 could effectively reduce physical
motion. The differences between 1.5 and 2.0, 2.0 and 2.5
were not signiﬁcant (p = 0.845, 1.00), however, 1.5 differs
signiﬁcantly from 2.5 and larger (p < 0.05 for all tests), 2.0
differs signiﬁcantly from 3 and larger (p = 0.004, 0.003).
For gains greater than 2.5, users did not feel that their
movements in the virtual world require a lot of physical
movement (p > 0.05 for tests between any of 2.5, 3.0 and
3.5). Users only needed to rotate their heads up to 72 degrees
for a gain of 2.5, close to the maximum comfortable rotation
angle. Hence, gains exceeding 2.5 seem to not inﬂuence the
feeling of decreased body motion to a substantial extent.

Sickness. The sickness scores were only signiﬁcantly
different when comparing gains of 1.0 to 3.0 and 3.5
(p = 0.018, p = 0.020), as well as 1.5 to 3.0 and 3.5
(p = 0.026, p = 0.020).

Applicability. Applicability differed signiﬁcantly between
gains of 1.5 and 3.0 (p = 0.027), 1.5 and 3.5 (p = 0.008),
2 and 3 (p = 0.016), 2 and 3.5 (p = 0.004), 2.5 and 3.5
(p = 0.024).

We also plotted the proportion of acceptance for each
gain in both blocks (Fig. 8). Applicability with scores greater
than 4, equal to 4 and less than 4 were considered ac-
ceptable, neutral and unacceptable respectively. The three
most applicable gains were 2.0, 1.5 and 2.5. However, their
acceptances in the second block decreased, possibly due to
the increase of sickness levels.

(green), neutral (gray) or unacceptable (red) in two blocks.

4.4.2 View Time

The view time reveals how long participants experienced
a gain, referring to the duration between the time they
started rotating their head and the questions appeared.
Participants spent on average 20 to 30 seconds for every
gain, only slightly longer for smaller gains (See Fig. 9). It
was interesting to note that users tended to alter their head
rotation speeds according to different gains so that they
traversed the virtual scene with a similar speed.

Fig. 9. View Time for each gain when observed in our experiment
(Observed) or when participants keep the same head rotation speed as
the gain is 1.0 (Reference). For the Observed line, the error bar shows
one standard deviation. See how participants adjust their head rotation
speed according to the gain and cost more time than reference.

We analyzed the view time with an ANOVA considering
6 gains × 2 blocks × 2 genders. A signiﬁcant difference was
found of block (F (1, 24) = 4.649, p = 0.0319) and gender
(F (1, 24) = 16.155, p < .0001). Users rotated faster in the
second block and female participants spent more time than
male participants. No other interaction effects were found.

4.4.3 Simulator Sickness

We measured the SSQ scores before the experiment, during
the middle break and after the all trials (Table 2). A Wilcoxon
signed-rank test with a 5% signiﬁcance level found that SSQ

score in the middle was signiﬁcantly higher than that at the
start (p = 0.002). The ﬁnal SSQ score was also signiﬁcantly
higher than the middle (p = 0.036).

4.5 Discussion

Rotation gains of 1.0 caused the least sickness and were still
considered to be the most natural. In redirected walking
techniques participants often favored no additional manip-
ulation (e.g. [45]), but this is not the case for seated VR
head ampliﬁcation in which physical movement is also an
essential concern. To fully explore the virtual scene, the
most natural mapping required users to move their bodies
extensively. Actually, there is a balance between physical
turning and naturalness along with sickness. We found that
participants have diverse opinions about a gain of 1.0. Three
participants regarded it as applicable, among them two
gave the highest applicability score, while other participants
rated it as not applicable for seated VR.

Most users preferred manipulation that made them
move less. From the results, we can see that a gain of 2.0
was rated the best in terms of applicability and about 60%
participants would accept rotation gains at 2.5, far exceeding
the detection thresholds. A gain of 2.5 is close to the verge
of a usable gain since it does both, it reduces movements
and seems to not increase nausea as we could not measure
a signiﬁcant difference compared to a gain of 1.0. Further-
more, 27% and 19% of the subjects were even comfortable
with gains at 3.0 and 3.5. However, we cannot neglect the
fact that in the second block, users lowered their ratings for
large gains. This is most likely due to their cybersickness
increased with time (see the SSQ score in Table 3) especially
with the rotation gains changed from trial to trial. In the
second block, they leaned toward more natural gains.

Therefore, we have afﬁrmed that head ampliﬁcation can
be treated as an interaction technique and noticeable gains
are usable for seated VR. Though gains around 2.5 were
applicable for many participants, they may not be suitable
for long time usage and should be examined carefully for
different users. We particularly highlight the importance of
an individual setup. One may either favor natural rotation
or tend to be “lazy” and not willing to move, or even a single
user can be versatile and have contradicting preferences
over time. Moreover, now that users are already aware of
the manipulation, the design can enable them to alter the
gain instantly to their current need, which might prolong
the available time for large gains and avoid possible adverse
side effects. If the region of interest is already known, it is
ideal to combine ampliﬁcation with redirection as in [46] to
reduce the time to constantly rotate around and be exposed
to higher gains. Our results provide reference to the range of
gain possible for the ampliﬁcation phase. It is also possible
to combine large rotation gains with other techniques such
as viewpoint snapping that reduce continuous viewpoint
motion by skipping frames to reduce cybersickness [11].

Head rotation speed is also an interesting aspect worth
discussing. Although participants were advised to main-
tain a normal speed during the experiment, they could
actually adjust it because the experiment design did not
strictly enforce the speed. If they rotated with the same
speed regardless of gains, the amount of visual information
received per time frame for rotation gain at 3.0 would be
three times than that of 1.0, making users more prone to
sickness and making it hard to see the virtual scene clearly.
Our results showed that they would instead rotate slower
with larger gains to assure the inﬂux of optical ﬂow did not
ﬂuctuate too much. Whereas not the main goal of our study,
it is possible to further investigate users’ sensitivity and
acceptance to rotation gains with controlled head rotation
speeds. The relationship has already been established in
redirected walking [34].

5 SIMULATION
We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference in the amount of
physical movement between a gain of 2.0 and 2.5. Both gains
enabled users to traverse the 360-degree scene with only
head movements and are an option for practical use. Hence,
we performed a computer simulation to further explore how
the movement may differ in more complex situations. We
selected a visual searching task that involved enough head-
turning: users needed to rotate their head to hit n balls
(here hit means the head yaw angle is equivalent to the
ball rotation). In practice, the ball might be a target in a
game, or an interesting character in a movie. At any time,
only one ball would appear at the scene and when a ball
is hit another one would be randomly generated elsewhere.
We experimented with several levels of restrictions on the
distance between two continuous balls (no restrictions or at
least some degrees apart) considering that balls might be
compact or scattered. The parameter n was empirically set
to 10. For simplicity, we assumed that users would always
rotate in the right direction of the next ball. We compared a
constant gain of 2.0, 2.5 and other two non-linear methods
that also enabled 360-degree within 180-degree head rota-
tion (2 − cos(θ) in [46], quadratic in [28]). Each restriction
pattern was repeated 1,000,000 times. We calculated how
many angles were needed for the head rotation and beyond
maximum comfortable rotation angle (set to 60 degree). The
results are shown in Table 3.

to more. We found whether the function of the tracked head
angle and virtual angle was concave or convex contributed
greatly to the result. 2 − cos(θ) was completely concave
between 0◦ and 90◦, so it was expected to have more
physical rotations given the same virtual ball distribution.
Quadratic was concave from 0◦ to 45◦ and convex from
45◦ and 90◦, hence the overall movement was similar to
that of a gain at 2.0, but movement beyond the maximum
comfortable rotation angle was much less. We admit that the
difference was accumulated from massive trials, it might
not be notable in actual use. However, it still told us that
concavity was a crucial consideration when designing a
suitable remapping function or strategy.

6 LIMITATION AND FUTURE WORK
Our ﬁrst two experiments suffer from the problem of limited
sample size and age distribution due to pandemic issues.
This might introduce a bias in our results. Another issue
is that in this paper, participants only rotated their heads
while in reality a small amount of upper body movement is
also acceptable even when seated. This needs to be studied
more deeply. In the second experiment, though we provided
enough time for participants to experience a certain gain, it
was far from a real application. Our results may only serve
as an upper bound and might not be used constantly. Fur-
ther research can focus on experiments that enforce longer
exposures to large gains and in more practical applications.
In this context, controlling the amount of cybersickness to
an affordable range might be a major concern. Also, the
inﬂuence of ampliﬁcation on spatial orientation was not
examined in our work, but we can be safe to conclude that
it would worsen as gains became larger. If the virtual scene
involves a lot of traveling or is not familiar to users, design-
ers should be more conservative for ampliﬁcation as users
may be confused in their orientation. Future work could also
examine the difference of spatial orientation, presence or
user performance for these large gains according to related
methodologies in [13], [28], [41]. Another factor we did
not explore is scene complexity. The scene complexity will
have an impact on the amount of optical ﬂow users would
experience during rotation. It could be that they might
accept large gains with simple scenes. We left it for future
work as the complexity was hard to distinguish and should
be addressed by delicate experiment design. Additionally,
conducting our experiments under controlled head rotation
motion is also a promising direction as it inﬂuences the
perception of users toward rotation gains [6].

Regarding the simulation, we only examined four types
of mappings but it is possible to extend it to dynamic rota-
tion gains (e.g. time dependent [64], velocity dependent [65],
or different rates of change [9]), pitch and roll direction and
be combined with other seated VR interaction techniques.
It can also be used to verify the effectiveness of proposed
redirection strategies and guide the design of user studies.

Generally, a gain of 2.5 required the least physical mo-
tion. A gain of 2.0 and quadratic were almost the same, and
they were much less than 2 − cos(θ). As for the movement
beyond the maximum comfortable rotation angle, the order-
ing was gain at 2.5, quadratic, gain at 2.0, 2−cos(θ) from less

7 CONCLUSION
The primary goal of our research was to investigate human
perception of altered head rotation in seated VR. We ﬁrst
conducted a psychophysical experiment using a 2AFC de-
sign to estimate detection thresholds of rotation gains in a

sitting and a standing condition. We found that users were
more sensitive to rotation gains while they are seated com-
pared to when they are standing with whole body rotation.
We further performed another experiment to analyze if they
could accept gains beyond the threshold and conﬁrmed that
suitable gains, even noticeable, could substantially decrease
the extensive movement needed by one-to-one mapping
while introducing little unnaturalness and sickness.

Our research provides insights about using rotation am-
pliﬁcation as an interaction technique for seated VR. Gains
larger than thresholds can be used to modify the head
movements in VR based on the preference of individuals
and the purposes of applications.
