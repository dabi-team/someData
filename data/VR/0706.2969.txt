Abstract. We analysed the high resolution spectra of a RU Cam,
classiﬁed as W Vir type star. The atmospheric parameters of RU Cam
were estimated Teﬀ =5250 K and log g=1.0. The hydrogen deﬁciency
of RU Cam was not conﬁrmed. The iron abundance, [Fe/H]=−0.37,
is close to the solar one. Abundances of most other elements are also
close to normal. We found considerable excesses of carbon and ni-
trogen:
[C/Fe]=+0.98, [N/Fe]=+0.60. The carbon to oxygen ratio is
C/O>1. The carbon isotopic abundance ratio is equal to 12C/13C=4.5.
For sodium a moderate overabundance Na/Fe=+0.55 was obtained. For
two moments of observations we found close heliocentric velocity values,
vr=−21.7 ± 0.8 and −23.1 ± 1.0 km s−1. Both spectra contain a pe-
culiar feature – an emission component of Na I doublet which location
agrees with the radial velocity from the bulk of metallic lines. For our
two observing moments we found no dependence of radial velocities on
the formation depth or on excitation energy for metallic lines.

1. INTRODUCTION

RU Cam is a variable star of W Vir type (Harris, 1985) with a
photometric period P ≈ 22.0d (Samus et al. 2004). Harris (1985) es-
timated the star’s distances from the Sun and from the galactic plane
as d=1.6 and z=0.7 kpc. These distances are based on photometric
data and well agree with the value of the star’s Hipparcos paral-
lax π=0.59 mas. RU Cam has a rich history of photometric stud-
ies. Variability of its radiaton was found a century ago by Ceraski
(1907). After that a lot of publications were devoted to studies of its
peculiar photometric behavior since the star has variable pulsating
magnitude and period. In 1965–1966 its irregular pulsation abruptly
decreased in amplitude from 1 mag to about 0.1–0.2 mag (Demers &

light curve (Kollath & Szeidl 1993).

On the contrary to high photometric popularity, RU Cam has
not been so popular for spectroscopists. Among the ﬁrst few was
Sanford (1928) who classiﬁed RU Cam as a carbon star. In the Cat-
alogue of Carbon Stars by Stephenson (1973) the star has a number
CGCS 6891. The estimated spectral types of RU Cam are R0, K0var,
C0.1, and C3.2.e. Chemical composition of RU Cam was studied
ﬁrst by Faraggiana & Hack (1967). Based on high resolution spec-
tra and using the curve-of-growth analysis, they concluded that the
star’s metallicity is close to normal. The carbon excess of the star
was found to be not larger than 2–3, the abundances of Ca, Ti, V,
Ni, and of rare earths are also sligthly overabundant relative to Fe.
Somewhat later Wallerstein (1968) determined also the atmospheric
parameters and reached similar conclusions about the metallicity of
RU Cam. These results were obtained with photographic observa-

advantages of both modern spectroscopy and analytical possibilities,
we undertook a new research of RU Cam spectra.

2. OBSERVATIONS

Our high resolution spectra were taken with the Nasmyth Echelle
Spectrometer (Panchuk et al. 1999; Panchuk et al. 2002) of Russian
6 m telescope on Dec., 05 2006 (JD 2454074.6) and on Feb.,07 2007
(JD 2454138.5). The spectrograph was equipped with an image slicer
(Panchuk et al. 2003). As a detector a CCD camera with 2052 ×
2052 pixels produced by the Copenhagen University Observatory was
used. The spectra for 2006 cover 516–669 nm without caps until
610 nm and the spectra for 2007 cover 452–602 nm without gaps.

The spectra were reduced using the NOAO astronomical data
analysis facility IRAF. We describe the reduction procedure in Kip-
per & Klochkova (2005, 2006).

As measured from the Th-Ar comparison spectra the resolution

is R ≈ 42 800 with FWHM of comparison lines about 7 km s−1.

3. ANALYSIS and RESULTS

3.1. Atmospheric parameters

We mentioned above that RU Cam has been found to be a Pop. II
Cepheid. At the same time it is among the few which are carbon

stars. If we assume that RU Cam is a Pop. II cepheid one could derive
from its light period of 22 days Teﬀ=5250 K, log g=1.2, MV = −2.4,
and M/M⊙ = 0.6 (Hall, 2000). These parameters were conﬁrmed by
Bergeat et al. (2002), who found for RU Cam Teﬀ=5215 K, Mbol=−1.8
If we adopt M/M⊙=0.6 the
and pulsational mass Mpuls=0.57 M⊙.
surface gravity with found Mbol and temperature will be log g=1.44.
(1998) presented the calibrating relations be-
tween the spectral line depths and the excitation temperature for F–
K supergiants. Using their relations for 15 pairs of lines we found
Tex=5227±216 K. According to these data the model (5250/1.5) from
Kurucz’s grid (Kurucz, 1993) was chosen as a starting model. The
independence of abundances on excitation energy of the lines was con-
ﬁrmed for Fe I lines (Fig. 1, right panel). However, the ionization equi-
librium of iron was not satisﬁed and the surface gravity was therefore
reduced. As a result the ﬁnal model (5250/1.0) was adopted. Also
the microturbulent velocity using Fe I lines was chosen ξt=4.3 km s−1
(Fig. 1, left panel, illustrates a propriety of such a choise). Afterwards
the other elements showed slightly diﬀerent ξt giving the error of ξt
about 0.5 km s−1.

3.2. Chemical abundances

The abundances were found using the Kurucz’s program WIDTH5.
Oscillator strengts were taken from Thevenin (1989, 1990) except of
those of C and O, which were taken from Wiese et al. (1996).

As follows from Table 1, the abundances determined for most chem-
ical elements are close to the chemical composition of the Sun (As-
plund et al., 2005). Metallicity of RU Cam is slightly decreased with
[Fe/H]=−0.37. The result is consistent with the normal values of
ratios [El/Fe] for a set of iron-group elements: Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Ni.
We note that the metals with the high condensation temperature
(Ca and Sc) also have the solar relative abundances:
[Ca/Fe]=0.00
and [Sc/Fe]=0.03. This points on ineﬀectiveness of selective depletion
processes by dust formation. That agrees with nondetection of dusty

IR–source associated with RU Cam.

At the same time we obtained the considerably modiﬁed content of
CNO–triad: [C/Fe]= +0.98, [N/Fe]=+0.60 and the carbon to oxygen
ratio C/O> 1. Overabundances of carbon and nitrogen mean that
matter which had been mixed into outer atmospheric layers had been
processed through He–burning. This points to an advanced evolu-
tionary stage of RU Cam. The obtained abundances indicate that the
matter in RU Cam suﬀered helium burning followed by CN cycling and
mixing to the surface of the star. The carbon abundance found from
the atomic carbon lines was conﬁrmed by synthesizing the C2 Swan
bands log A(C) = 9.00 ± 0.05 and the nitrogen abundance was deter-
mined from the CN red system bands log A(N) = 8.00 ± 0.30. The
Bell’s (1976) line-list was used for spectrum synthesis. The carbon
isotopic abundance ratio 12C/13C=4.5±0.5 was determined using the
C2 Swan system (1,0) bands at 473.7 and 474.4 nm and (0,1) bands at
562.55 and 563.50 nm. At these wavelengths Bell’s list does not give
good wavelength match and therefore the list compiled by Alexander
(1991) was used. Earlier determinations of the carbon isotopic ratio
for RU Cam were by Climenhaga (1960), who found 12C/13C=5.7 and
Fraggania & Hack (1967) 12C/13C=9.

In addition to CNO –excess, we obtained a moderate sodium over-
abundance, [Na/Fe]=+0.55 which could be expalined by activity of
Ne–Na cycle. One could suspect that this Na-excess could be overes-
timated due to the non-LTE eﬀects in the atmosphere of cool super-
giant. But, according to Takeda et al. (2003), for the used lines the
non-LTE eﬀects are practically insigniﬁcant being less than −0.10 dex.
For Na I D lines, however, these eﬀects are very large amounting to
–1.0 dex in the most worse cases. This is one of the reasons why Na I
D lines are not suitable for abundance determinations. For the illus-
tration these lines were synthesized taking into account the hyperﬁne
structure of the lines (McWilliam et al. 1995). In Fig. 3 the results
are plotted. The used abundance is by 0.9 dex larger than found from
weaker lines.

Abundances of all heavy metals (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) are
not enhanced. Their relative contents are close to the solar ones. As a
whole, the chemical composition of RU Cam is not coincident with the
chemical abundances pattern typical for W Vir type stars in globular
clusters. Atmospheres of these evolved stars are metal-poor and en-
riched by helium, carbon, and heavy metals of s–process (Gonzalez &
Wallerstein, 1994). We have to note also that the chemical abundance
pattern of RU Cam diﬀers from the chemical composition of W Vir it-
self – the archetype of population II cepheids. According to Barker et

6

T. Kipper, V. Klochkova

al. (1971) W Vir is a metal-poor star, its metallicity [Fe/H]=−1.1, its
content of heavy metals is essentially decreased relative to metallicity:
[Met/Fe]=−2.2.

Lloyd Evans (1983) selected a small group (7 stars) of pulsat-
ing stars having a carbon excess and called them carbon cepheids.
These stars show strong absorbtion bands of C2, CH, CN and the ab-
sence of any enhancement of the heavy metals produced in s–process.
RU Cam was listed among these objects. Two of this group mem-
bers V553 Cen and RT TrA were studied by Wallerstein & Gonzalez
(1996) and Wallerstein et al. (2000). In order to compare the results
we present in the last column of Table 1 the chemical abundances of
V553 Cen obtained by these authors. The results for RT TrA are very
close to that of V553 Cen. The comparison shows almost coinciding
abundance pattern. The carbon isotopic abundance ratio for V553 Cen
and RT TrA 12C/13C=4.0–5.0 is also close to that of RU Cam. Both
these stars have been associated with shorter period subclass of Pop. II
cepheids BL Her. They are somewhat hotter and less luminous than
RU Cam. At the moment no evolutionary sequences could predict
their chemical composition.

3.3. Hydrogen deﬁciency

Bergeat et al. (2002) when deriving the parameters of RU Cam
added a HdC label to it. However we found that the Hα and Hβ
lines are quite normal for early K spectral type. We compare the
proﬁles of the Hα and Hβ lines in RU Cam with those in Arcturus
(K1.5III) spectrum (Fig. 2). On our request RU Cam was observed
by K. Annuk on June, 06 2007 with the Tartu Observatory 60” tele-
scope with resolution R ≈ 2500 near the CH G-band near 430 nm.
Comparison of this spectrum with the synthesized CH band spec-
trum gave satisfactory ﬁt. For synthesizing we used the Bell’s line-
list, model (5250/1.0) and normal H content. We therefore judge that
RU Cam is not hydrogen deﬁcient. A similar result was obtained by
Faraggiana & Hack (1967).

4. RADIAL VELOCITIES

In the following we call the spectra obtained on Dec., 05 2006
for shortness as SpI, and the ones obtained on Feb., 07 2007 as
SpII. The corrections due to the solar motion we adopted for SpI is
+9.37 km s−1 and for SpII −12.64 km s−1. To improve the accuracy
we selected only weakly blended lines. For SpI we measured 158
lines and for SpII – 150 lines. All results concerning radial velocities

are presented in Table 2. The average radial velocity obtained from
metallic lines for SpI was vr=−21.7 ± 0.8 km s−1 and vr=−23.1 ±
1.0 km s−1 for SpII. The errors indicated are the weighted by the
number of lines standard deviations of measurements for diﬀerent
metals. Coincidence of our two vr values is explained by similar
phase of our observations since the observing moments are separated
by approximately 64 days what is close to 3P.

Our vr values agree very well with the earlier published data.
Wallerstein & Crampton (1967) found after RU Cam has ceased its
light variations vr = −22.9 ± 2.2 km s−1. Much earlier Sanford had
(1928) found the velocity variation vr ≈ −3 ÷ −37 and the systemic
velocity –23.9 km s−1. Later Barnes et al.
(1988) conﬁrmed this
interval of vr variability.

If the radial velocity is completely caused by Galactic rotation at
the distance of 1.7 kpc in direction of RU Cam it would be –14 km/s.
Our measured velocity is reached at the distance of 2.7 kpc. This is
also the upper limit posed by Wallerstein (1968). If the distance is
so large the star’s bolometric magnitude would be Mb = −3.9. This
means that log g should be lowered 0.5 dex, which is not impossible
considering our errors. This luminosity is already higher than the
carbon stars formation limit by third dredgeup on TP-AGB. But
this is not certainly true for V553 Cen and RT TrA. It is doubtful if
the shorter and longer period carbon cepheids have diﬀerent origins
and exactly the same chemistry.

The Na I D lines in the RU Cam spectra have composite proﬁles.
First, they show a two-components structure (Fig. 3). We propose
that there are emission components close to the core of both D–lines.
As follows from Table 2, location of Na I–emission to vr practically

8

T. Kipper, V. Klochkova

coincides with the average vr value from numerous metallic lines.
Secondly, the red wings of Na I proﬁles are slightly sharper than the
blue ones. Earlier Faraggiana & Hack (1967) detected emission core
in the H and K lines of Ca II. These authors believed that emissions

fairly high galactic latitude, l=+29o, its interstellar extinction does
not exceed 0.01m (Wamsteker, 1966). This means that we see Na I
lines without interstellar components. This suggestion is conﬁrmed
by the comparison of the observed and theoretical spectra near the
Na I doublet (Fig. 3). It is natural to suggest for a pulsating star that
emission components of D–lines Na I indicate the presence of a shock
wave in the stars atmosphere. But permanency of both intensity and
location of emissions is doubtful in the framework of this proposal.
In accordance with Faraggiana & Hack (1967), we are apt to think
that a gaseous envelope reveals itself in the Na I emissions.

Faraggiana & Hack (1967) found an evidence of vr stratiﬁcation:
spectral lines of diﬀerent excitation give diﬀerent vr. Having numer-
ous accurate vr values, we check whether the radial velocities depend
on excitation energy or the formation depth of the lines. For this aim
we used Fe I, Fe II, Ti I and Ti II lines. As a result, for two moments
of observations we found no dependence on formation depth as de-
ﬁned in Kurucz’s program WIDTH5 or on excitation energy for these
lines. As is evident in Fig. 2 the Hα proﬁle is asymmetrical and if
the blue wing is mirrored, then vr=−24.9 km s−1. If the full line is
ﬁtted vr=−20.6 km s−1. This asymmetry could well be caused by
the emission in red wing. The Hβ line is more or less symmetri-
cal and vr=−19.4 km s−1. The metal lines are more blueshifted than
the hydrogen lines, but taking into account the accuracy of vr mea-
surements, we may conclude that the position of both H I lines is
consistent with the value of vr derived from numerous metallic lines.

5. CONCLUSIONS

Based on the high resolution spectra of a carbon star RU Cam,
we obtained its atmospheric parameters Teﬀ=5250 K, log g=1.0, ξt =
4.3 ± 0.5 km s−1, and detailed chemical composition. As a result, the
hydrogen deﬁciency of RU Cam was not conﬁrmed. The iron abun-
dance, [Fe/H]=−0.37, is close to the solar one. The abundances of
most other elements are also close to normal. We obtained consid-
erably altered abundances of carbon and nitrogen:
[C/Fe]=+0.98,
[N/Fe]=+0.60. The carbon to oxygen ratio is C/O> 1. The sodium
overabundance, Na/Fe=+0.55, is real since the non-LTE eﬀects for
the studied Na I lines are small. As a whole the chemical composition
of RU Cam is not coincident with the chemical abundances pattern
typical for W Vir type stars.

The heliocentric velocity values vr= −21.8 ± 1.8 and −23.2 km s−1
taken for 2 close photometric phases are coincident within the error
box.

Both spectra of RU Cam contain a peculiar feature – an emission

10

component of Na I doublet whose location agrees with the radial
velocity from the bulk of metallic lines.

As a whole, taking into account the position above galactic plane,
the close to the solar metallicity of RU Cam, details of chemical com-
position and value of its systemic velocity vr=−24 −1, we may con-
clude that this far evolved star belongs to thick disc population of
Galaxy.
