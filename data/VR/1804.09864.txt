Rate-Utility Optimized Streaming 
of Volumetric Media for Augmented Reality 

Jounsup Park, Philip A. Chou, and Jenq-Neng Hwang1 

Abstract  –  Volumetric  media,  popularly  known  as 
holograms,  need  to  be  delivered  to  users  using  both  on-
demand and live streaming, for new augmented reality (AR) 
and  virtual  reality  (VR)  experiences. 
  As  in  video 
streaming,  hologram  streaming  must  support  network 
adaptivity  and  fast  startup,  but  must  also  moderate  large 
bandwidths,  multiple  simultaneously  streaming  objects, 
and  frequent  user  interaction,  which  requires  low  delay.   
In this paper, we introduce the first system to our knowledge 
designed specifically for streaming volumetric media.    The 
system  reduces  bandwidth  by  introducing  3D  tiles,  and 
culling them or reducing their level of detail depending on 
their relation to the user’s view frustum and distance to the 
user. 
  Our  system  reduces  latency  by  introducing  a 
window-based  buffer,  which  in  contrast  to  a  queue-based 
buffer allows insertions near the head of the buffer rather 
than only at the tail of the buffer, to respond quickly to user 
interaction.    To allocate bits between different tiles across 
multiple objects, we introduce a simple greedy yet provably 
optimal  algorithm 
for  rate-utility  optimization.  We 
introduce utility measures based not only on the underlying 
quality  of  the  representation,  but  on  the  level  of  detail 
relative  to  the  user’s  viewpoint  and  device  resolution. 
Simulation  results  show  that  the  proposed  algorithm 
provides  superior  quality  compared  to  existing  video-
streaming  approaches  adapted  to  hologram  streaming,  in 
terms  of  utility  and  user  experience  over  variable, 
throughput-constrained networks.

INTRODUCTION 

From  the  moment  the  first  commercial  systems  for 
streaming video on demand over the Internet were released in 
1997 until the present, streaming video on demand has grown 
exponentially  along  several  dimensions.  The  first  systems 
streamed 176x144 (QCIF) video at 15 frames per second (fps), 
over  56  Kbps  modems,  compressed  to  40  Kbps.  Today, 
1920x1080 (Full HD) video at 30 fps is regularly streamed to 
broadband users at 20 Mbps, thanks to a doubling of  the last 
mile bandwidth to the consumer every 2.5 years, and a doubling 
of the compression quality every 10 years, or faster. During the 
same period, the Internet backbone capacity has increased 40% 
annually  to  about  300  Tbps,  not  including  the  proprietary 
networks  of  content  providers  such  as  Amazon,  Facebook, 

Google,  and  Microsoft  [1].  Cache-based  content  distribution 
networks, originally developed for web traffic, were leveraged 
by  basing  streaming  video  protocols  on  HTTP,  and  making 
video  servers  look  like  stateless  web  servers,  both  for  on-
demand  and  live  streaming.  The  combination  of  these 
developments  has  positioned  over-the-top  (OTT)  streaming 
video on demand to become the dominant means for consuming 
video, in any form,  worldwide. The upcoming deployment of 
5G will cement this position by commanding mobile platforms 
as well. 

While  OTT  live  and  on-demand  streaming  video  are  on 
their way to becoming the dominant  way of delivering video, 
new  forms  of  immersive  media  have  recently  been  born, 
offering experiences  well beyond ordinary  video.    Such  new 
forms of immersive  media include  spherical video  for  virtual 
reality  (VR),  and  volumetric  media,  popularly  known  as 
holograms, for  augmented reality (AR) as  well as VR. These 
new media will also be streamed live and on demand. 

Spherical (or 360° or omnidirectional) video has a number 
of variants, including simple monoscopic spherical video with 
two degrees of freedom (DOF), allowing the user to change the 
azimuth  and  elevation  of  the  field  of  view,  suitable  for  web 
browsers; 3DOF video, allowing changing yaw, pitch, and roll 
with  correct  stereo  parallax,  more  suitable  for  head  mounted 
displays; 3DOF+ video additionally allowing short translational 
motion  due  to  the  head  pivot  to  reduce  motion  sickness;  and 
omnidirectional  6DOF  video  allowing  a  few  steps  of 
translational motion. Of these, the only one with any significant 
deployment  is  the  simple  monoscopic  2DOF  spherical  video.   
Essentially, this is ordinary video projected onto a sphere, with 
the  user  at  the  center.  The  sphere,  at  4𝜋  steradians,  is  about 
200 times the steradians of view required to see a picture placed 
at  a typical distance of four times the  picture diagonal. Thus, 
the  bandwidth  of  simple  monoscopic  2DOF  spherical  video 
could  be  over  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  that  of 
ordinary video. Fortunately, though the user may turn her gaze 
in any direction, her view is foveated. This allows the spherical 
video to be streamed more efficiently by attempting to stream 
high  resolution  only  where  the  user  is  looking,  and  low 
resolution elsewhere. This is an approach taken in several works 
[15]-[20] For example, the  spherical video can be partitioned 
into  tiles,  and  the  tiles  can  be  streamed  with  different 
resolutions depending on where the user is looking.

Just  like  streaming  ordinary  video,  streaming  spherical 
video  must  be  network-adaptive,  that  is,  adaptive  to  network 
variability.  For  this  aspect  of  streaming  spherical  video,  the 
same network-adaptive techniques used for streaming ordinary 
video  can  be  used:  buffering,  monitoring  and  predicting  the 
state  of  the  network,  and  selecting  representations  at  the 
appropriate bit rates to stream in order to maximize the quality 
perceived by the user.   

The  main  new  challenge  that  spherical  video  presents  to 
streaming media is the higher level of user interactivity required 
for spherical video than for ordinary video. For ordinary video, 
user  interactivity  is  usually  limited  to  starting,  stopping,  and 
perhaps fast forwarding the video. For these user interactions, 
only starting has had a significant impact on the algorithms used 
to determine how to fetch data over the network. Indeed, in the 
early  years  of  streaming,  the  problem  of  starting  fast  while 
building  the  buffer  was  a  key  problem,  solved  at  first  by 
bursting  the  transmission  rate  [2],  then  by  slowing  down  the 
playback [3], and finally by playing back at lower quality until 
the buffer is established [4]. For spherical video, however, there 
is  user  interactivity  not  just  at  the  start.  Any  time  during 
playback the user can quickly change where she is looking, with 
a momentary glance or turn of the head to change the azimuth 
and  elevation  of  the  viewport.  Thus  streaming  for  spherical 
video must be user-adaptive. To keep average bandwidth low 
while  keeping  the  quality  perceived  by  the  user  high,  it  is 
necessary to predict the variation in user behavior and pre-fetch 
the  data  in  advance  or  else  react  quickly  to  make  up  any 
shortfall  with  low  latency.  In  this  sense,  user-adaptivity  is 
exactly analogous to network-adaptivity. 

Streaming volumetric media, or holograms, for AR or VR 
must  handle  even  higher  levels  of  user  interaction  than 
streaming spherical video for VR. Since holograms support full 
6DOF, or free-viewpoint, not only may a user turn her head to 
change  her  view  direction,  but  she  may  also  navigate  freely 
among  a  multitude  of  holograms,  changing  both  her  view 
direction  and  position  in  space,  in  the  process  potentially 
changing  her proximity to the various holograms over a wide 
range of distances, and changing the direction from which she 
sees the holograms. 

In  this  paper,  we  address  the  problems  of  streaming 
holograms in AR/VR, using novel approaches to accommodate 
the higher level of user interactivity. We introduce the notion of 
a window as a buffer, replacing the traditional notion of a queue 
as a buffer. Using a window rather than a queue, it is possible 
to  respond  quickly  to  an  unforeseen  user  action  by  inserting 
updated content just-in-time before it is played back, rather than 
inserting it at the end of the queue  and subjecting the user to 
large latencies. When network behavior and user behavior are 
predictable,  the  window  acts  as  a  queue.  We  also  extend  the 
notion  of  2D  tiles  used  in  spherical  video  to  3D  tiles  for 
holograms, so that different tiles may have different resolutions 
depending on where the user is positioned and looking relative 
to each tile, thus saving bandwidth by focusing on what the user 
is  looking  at.  While  the  concept  of  3D  tiles  may  seem 
straightforward,  there  are  several  complicating  issues.  First, 
many of the 3D tiles, as regions of space, are empty a significant 
part of the time. Thus, even if the user viewpoint is not changing, 
the  set  of  tiles  occupied  by  content  and  visible  to  the  user  is 
content-dependent  and  changing.  Especially  considering  that 
there can be many more tiles in 3D than in 2D, this requires an

efficient  way  to  index  and  address  the  tiles  for  holograms  in 
AR/VR not needed for spherical video in VR. Second, in  3D 
the  tiles  may  be  occluded  or  far  away.  When  streaming 
spherical video, the distance from the user to the scene is not 
variable. However,  when  streaming  holograms, the  scale  of  a 
tile  in  the  user’s  view,  and  hence  the  utility  of  its  decoded 
representation, can change dramatically as an inverse function 
of the user’s distance to the tile, and may also be limited by the 
resolution of the rendering device. We develop a model of the 
utility of the tile representations based not only on its bitrate and 
whether the  tile is  visible, but also on the distance of the tile 
from  the  user.  Finally,  we  develop  a  greedy  yet  optimal 
algorithm for maximizing the utility of the tiles subject to a rate 
constraint and couch it within the client buffer manager of the 
streaming  client,  to  request  an  optimal  set  of  tiles  at  every 
transmission  opportunity.  The  algorithm  naturally  handles 
bitrate  allocation  between  multiple  holograms  streaming 
simultaneously,  as  well  as  their  playback  at  different  speeds.   
We  believe  our  work  is  the  first  to  address  streaming  of 
volumetric media or holograms for AR or VR.   

An overview of our system for streaming volumetric media 
is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  On  the  left,  a  web  server  stores  the 
volumetric  media  objects,  or  holograms,  for  streaming.  Each 
object  is  represented  as  a  sequence  of  voxelized  point  cloud 
(VPC)  frames,  the  frames  are  grouped  into  groups  of  frames 
(GOFs), and the sequence of GOFs is divided temporally into 
segments.  Each  segment  is  independently  compressed  to  a 
small set of representations, each representation at  a different 
bitrate. The bitrates are constant across all segments. Each GOF 
is divided spatially into tiles, which are independently coded.   

to  describe 

A  media  presentation  description  (MPD),  or  manifest, 
accompanies  each  object 
the  collection  of 
representations,  while  a  segment  index  accompanies  each 
segment  to  index  the  collection  of  tiles  within  the  segment.   
On the right, the buffer manager in an HTTP client downloads 
the manifest, downloads the segment index for each segment in 
the  window,  estimates  the  throughput,  estimates  the  user 
position, calculates the optimal collection of 3D tiles that will 
maximize utility for a given rate constraint, requests the tiles, 
downloads them into the buffer, advances the window, releases 
the tiles that fall out of the window for rendering, decoding, and 
presentation by the application, and repeats. 

Experimental  results  show,  regarding  network  adaptivity, 
that our system has higher throughput and robustness compared 
to previous state of the art algorithms. Further, regarding user 
adaptivity,  it  offers  lower  latency  and  higher  quality  than 
alternative designs, because the buffer is a window rather than 
a queue, and our utility maximization algorithm knows how to 
manage such a window. 

This paper is organized as follows. Section II covers related 
work.    Section III details our system. Sections IV and V detail 
our  utility  functions  and  rate-utility  optimization  algorithm.   
Section  VI  presents  experimental  results,  and  Section  VII 
concludes.

A.  Network-adaptive video streaming 

Throughput  and  latency  through  the  Internet  from  a 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
streaming server to a client is not always stable. Therefore, the 
content  must  be  buffered  by  the  client  to  ensure  continuous 
playback.  During  periods  where  the  network  throughput 
momentarily drops or even goes to zero, the content already in 
the buffer may be played back without the user noticing a stall, 
or  rebuffering  event.    Furthermore,  the  content  quality  (as  a 
function of its bitrate) may have to be varied over time to adapt 
to  changing  network  conditions.    During  periods  where  the 
network throughput drops for an extended period, the quality of 
the  content  may  have  to  be  reduced  to  match  the  lower 
throughput.    If the network throughput increases later, then the 
quality  of  the  content  may  be  increased,  or  alternatively,  the 
duration of the buffer may be increased, or both. How to adapt 
the bitrate of the content as a function of what is happening with 
the network and the state of the buffer, while avoiding stalls and 
giving the user the maximum average quality without too many 
quality changes, is known as client buffer management, and has 
been the core issue in streaming media to the present time. 

The early work on video streaming assumed packet-level 
communication between a server and client. Practical systems 
were  frequently  built  on  top  of  lossy  protocols  such  as 
RTP/UDP and RTCP/UDP. The emphasis was on sender-driven 
streaming, although client-driven approaches were considered.   
As an example, Chou and Miao  [5]  performed rate-distortion 
optimized  streaming  of  packetized  media  in  an  environment 
where individual packets were transmitted or requested, whose 
delivery could be confirmed only after a round trip time, during 
which  many  packets  would  be  “in  the  air”  necessitating  a 
Markov decision process model for determining which packets 
to  transmit  or  request.  The  emphasis  was  on  a  continuum  of 
quality enabled by fine grained scalable (FGS) coding. 

Eventually  the  early  lossy,  packet-level,  FGS  streaming 
was simplified by chunking the packets into longer segments of 
time,  transmitting  them  by  a  reliable  protocol  (TCP),  and 
chunking the quality into a sparse set of multiple bitrate (MBR) 
representations,  which  were  simulcast.  [6][7]  was  one  of  the 
first works in this area, proposing a receiver-driven approach to 
streaming  of  MBR  content.  By  transmitting  the  chunks  over 
HTTP/TCP  as  the  reliable  protocol,  this  receiver-driven 
approach became ideally suited to clients of web servers, and 
thus became the basis for practical systems and protocols such 
as  Microsoft  Smooth  Streaming,  Adobe  HTTP  Dynamic 
Streaming (HDS), Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).    The 
approach  was  eventually  standardized  as  Dynamic  Adaptive 
Streaming  over  HTTP  (DASH)  [8].  In  these  approaches,  the 
streaming  client  appears  to  the  web  server  as  a  web  client, 
issuing HTTP GET requests to obtain the data. (In practice, a 
content distribution network, or CDN, intercepts such requests 
and returns the requested data from a nearby cache. Whether the 
data is returned from the original web server or from a CDN is 
not  directly  visible  to  the  client.)  The  client  first  obtains  a 
manifest,  known 
the  media 
presentation  description  (MPD),  which  describes  the  media 
chunks, e.g., the segments and their bitrates, for a stream. The 
client buffer management algorithm  then uses the manifest to 
determine which chunks to request, and when to request them, 

terminology  as 

in  DASH 

depending  on  how  long  it  takes  for  the  requested  chunks  to 
arrive over the network.   

The DASH protocol does not specify  which client buffer 
management  algorithm  to  use.  An  implementor  is  free  to 
implement  any  algorithm.  Various  algorithms  have  been 
proposed  [9].  Recent  client  buffer  management  algorithms 
model the client buffer as a queue of segments.    Each segment 
can have a different bitrate.    The client buffer manager (CBM) 
simply  determines  the  bitrate  for  the  next  segment,  requests 
from the server the chunk with that bitrate for the next segment, 
receives the chunk, and puts it at the end of the queue.    Thus, 
the only algorithmic question is which bitrate to request for the 
next segment, and when to request it. 

Recent client buffer management algorithms fall into two 

categories:  throughput-based  and  buffer-based  algorithms.   
With  throughput-based  algorithms,  clients  request  the  video 
bitrate for each segment  based on  the client’s estimate  of  the 
current  network throughput. This is an intuitive way to select 
the  video  bitrate.    However,  throughput  estimation  error  can 
cause buffer depletion, leading to rebuffering events.    Jiang et 
al.  [10]  introduced  a  throughput-based  algorithm,  FESTIVE, 
that  improves  throughput  estimation  by  considering  outliers. 
Luca  el  al.  [11]  introduced  a  throughput-based  algorithm, 
ELASTIC, that eliminates the on-off transmission pattern that 
makes  throughput  estimation  difficult,  thereby  making  the 
estimation more robust.    Li et al. [12] reduced the throughput 
estimation error by taking the on-off pattern into account. These 
algorithms improve throughput estimation accuracy, but do not 
consider buffer status to achieve better performance. 

With  buffer-based  algorithms,  clients  request  the  video 
bitrate for each segment based on the buffer occupancy. When 
the buffer occupancy is high, which means that the buffer has 
enough video frames to play without receiving new frames for 
quite a while, a client may request a video segment with a high 
bitrate  even  though  it  may  take  a  long  time  to  download. 
Otherwise,  the  client  may  request  a  low  bitrate,  in  order  to 
download  the  segment  quickly  and  build  the  duration  of  the 
buffer.    Huang  et  al.  [13]  proposed  a  buffer-based  algorithm 
that considers only the current buffer occupancy to request the 
bitrate  of  the  next  segment.    Used  by  Netflix  for  long 
entertainment videos, in steady state it typically builds over 90 
seconds of buffer occupancy, making playback in the absence 
of  much  interaction  extremely  robust.    Spiteri  et  al.  [14] 
provide a non-linear model to select better video bitrates among 
a limited number of choices.   

Unfortunately,  neither 

rate-based  nor  buffer-based 
algorithms are well suited for VR or AR streaming applications, 
in which user interaction is frequent.    Buffer-based algorithms 
rely on large buffer durations for their stability, while rate-based 
algorithms pay little or no attention to buffer duration.    Neither 
is appropriate when user interactions are frequent, because the 
buffer duration translates directly to the delay experienced by a 
user between an interaction by the user (say a head turn) and a 
change in the content being played back.    Such a delay should 
be sub-second, certainly not much longer. 

B.  Tile-based streaming of spherical video 

Streaming  spherical  video  is  more  challenging  than 
streaming ordinary video, because spherical video has orders of 
magnitude  more  pixels  for  the  same  angular  resolution  as 
ordinary  video.    However,  a  user  can  foveate  on  only  one 
portion of the spherical video at any given moment. Thus, large 
portions of the spherical video behind the user or away from the 
foveal region may be streamed with much lower bitrate than the 
portion in the foveal region [15]-[20] . One way to achieve this 
is  with  tiles  [15][16][18][20].  In  tile-based  streaming,  the 
spherical video is partitioned spatially into smaller tiles, which 
are  independently  encoded  and  packaged  as  video  streams  at 
different bitrates. The client buffer manager tracks not only the 
network  throughput  and/or  buffer  status,  but  also  tracks  the 
user’s view direction, and requests different representations for 
each  tile  depending  on  the  user’s  view  direction,  and  more 
importantly,  depending  on 
the  client  buffer  manager’s 
prediction of what the user’s view direction will be at the time 
the  requested  representations  will  be  played  back  to  the  user 
after  making  their  way  through  the  buffer.  Fig.  2  shows  the 
architecture of a tiled spherical video streaming system. 

Since multiple tiles are delivered at the same time through 
the same network resource, which has limited bandwidth, the 
client buffer manager must allocate the available bit rate among 
the tiles, to provide the best experience to the client.    Alface, 
Macq, and Verzijp [15] introduced an algorithm that selects a 
bitrate for each tile to maximize a utility function subject to an 
overall bitrate constraint.    The utility function is based on the 
probabilities that the user will be looking at different tiles, at the 
time that the tiles are played back to the user,  𝑇  seconds in the 
future  if  𝑇   is  the  current  buffer  duration.    The  algorithm 
selects  higher  bitrates  for  tiles  with  higher  probability  to  be 
looked at  𝑇  seconds in the future.    Because prediction of the 
user’s view is imperfect, even when  𝑇  is only a few seconds, 
most  tile-based  bitrate  selection  algorithms  elect  to  spend  at 
least a minimal bitrate on every tile, so that the user will see at 
least a minimum level of quality even with an unexpected head 
turn. 

C.  Volumetric media communication 

Volumetric media have existed at least since the invention 
of the Gabor hologram in 1948 [21]. In recent years they have 
been created using depth cameras and  surface reconstruction, 
e.g., [22][23][24], rather than laser interferometry. 

To  date,  communication  of  volumetric  media  has  been 
driven  mostly  by  immersive  telepresence,  e.g.,  [25][26] 
[27][28][29][30].    Immersive  telepresence,  now  sometimes 
referred  to  as  holographic  telepresence,  holopresence,  or 
holoportation,  is  two-way  interactive  communication  like 
telephony,  which 
involves  very  different 
communication protocols and algorithms than streaming media 
on  demand  or  live  broadcast,  principally  because  the  latency 
and fan-out requirements are so different. 

traditionally 

To  our  knowledge,  there  has  been  no  published  work  to 
date  on  streaming  volumetric  media  on  demand  or  live 

broadcast.  One  work  comes  close,  in  that  it  addresses  the 
creation of  “streamable free-viewpoint video” [31]. In [31], a 
high-quality  point  cloud  is  computed  for  each  frame  from 
dozens of RGB and IR cameras in an outside-in configuration.   
The  point  cloud  is  used  to  create  a  watertight  mesh  using 
Poisson  surface  reconstruction,  and  surface  colors  are 
computed  by  blending  information  from  the  RGB  cameras.   
Keyframes are selected and the group of frames (GOF) between 
keyframes  is re-meshed into  a temporally-consistent dynamic 
mesh. The sequence of color texture maps within each GOF is 
compressed  as  a  group  of  pictures  (GOP)  in  an  H264  video 
sequence  inside  an  MP4  file,  and  the  associated  geometry  is 
compressed separately and included in the MP4 file in a custom 
Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) unit, suitable for streaming.   
However,  no  streaming  experiments  are  performed,  and  no 
protocols  or  algorithms  that  may  address  the  increased  user 
interactivity  requirements  of  volumetric  media  streaming  for 
applications such as AR are discussed.     

Compression of volumetric media is currently in a period 
of  rapid  improvement.  Early  work  assumed  that  volumetric 
represented  as  meshes.  Therefore,  mesh 
media  were 
compression 
images/video 
techniques  such  as  geometry 
[32][33],  and  graph  wavelets  [34][35]  were  examined.   
However, as point cloud capture became more prevalent, later 
work  dropped  the  requirement  of  compressing  meshes  per  se 
and  turned  towards  compressing  only  what  is  necessary  to 
reconstruct the geometry and its color attributes at the decoder.   
Thus volumetric media began to be represented and compressed 
as point clouds [36]-[46].    Point cloud compression (PCC) is 
now the subject of an MPEG standardization effort  [47]. The 
point  cloud  codecs  generally  assume  the  point  clouds  are 
voxelized. That  means  the  points  (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧)   are  quantized  to  a 
voxel  grid  within  a  bounding  cube.  A  voxel  is  said  to  be 
occupied if it contains a point, and any  𝑁 × 𝑁 × 𝑁  grouping 
of  voxels  is  said  to  be  occupied  if  it  contains  any  occupied 
voxels. By grouping voxels together into independently coded 
tiles,  it  is  possible  to  extend  the  basic  idea  of  tile-based 
streaming 
However, unlike the tiles in spherical video, the set of occupied 
tiles is sparse, changing, content-dependent, and possibly large.   
Furthermore,  the  set  of  visible  tiles  is  not  only  content-
dependent but also viewpoint-dependent due to occlusions.

How  to  stream  such  tile-based  partitions  of  volumetric 
media in the presence of user interactivity is the subject of our 
work. 

III.  WINDOW-BASED CLIENT BUFFER MANAGER 

In this section, we detail several concepts of our window-

based client buffer manager (CBM):    the window-based buffer, 
the file format and how it supports multiple objects and tiles, 
the  interface  between  the  client  buffer  manager  and  the 
playback  engine  to  support  user  interaction,  and  the  CBM 
operation. 

A.  Window-based buffer 

When  a  user  wearing  a  head  mounted  display  turns  her 

horizontal axis is user time  𝑡, for example, the user’s wall clock 
time.    The vertical axis is media time  𝜏, for example, the wall 
clock  time  at  which  the  content  was  recorded.    The  figure 
shows two monotonically increasing functions:  𝑊𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙(𝑡)  and 
𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡) .    At  any  given  user  time  𝑡 ,  the  vertical  interval 
[𝑊𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙(𝑡), 𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡)]   between  these  two  functions  is  the 
window of content that may be in the client buffer at any given 
user  time.    As  user  time  𝑡   advances,  the  window  moves 
upward.    Content  leaving  the  trailing  edge  of  the  window  is 
released  to  the  decoder  for  playback.    Content  entering  the 
leading edge of the window is newly available for the client to 
request from the server. 

  Specifically, if the user seeks to media time  𝜏0  and plays 
the content at speed  𝜈  beginning at time  𝑡0, then at any time 
𝑡 ≥ 𝑡0  the content at media time 

𝑊𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙(𝑡) = 𝜏0 + 𝜈(𝑡 − 𝑡0) 

is released from the buffer as it leaves the trailing edge of the 
window, so that it can be decoded and played back to the user.   
At the same time  𝑡, the client buffer manager may fetch content 
as far ahead as media time 

𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡) = 𝑊𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙(𝑡) + 𝜈Δ𝑊(𝑡 − 𝑡0), 

where  Δ𝑊(𝑡)  is  a  window  size  function.    The  window  size 
function  is  the  number  of  seconds  of  user  time  in  the  buffer.   
The  window  size  function  that  we  use  in  our  experiments, 
illustrated in Fig. 3, is 

Δ𝑊(𝑡) = {

1 + 𝑡 0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 4

5

4 ≤ 𝑡.

(1) 

For this function, the window size grows from 1 to 5 seconds 
over  the  first  4  seconds  of  playback  time,  then  remains  at  5 
seconds. The purpose is for window size to start small to allow 
playback to begin quickly, but to grow soon to allow playback 
to be robust to network dropouts.  Other functions besides  (1) 
are also possible, such as the logarithmic function  𝛼 + 𝛽 log(𝑡) 
used in [5]. 

Early work (by one of us) used this kind of a window-based 
approach for rate-distortion optimized streaming of packetized 
media [5]. In that work, in the case of client-driven streaming, 
the client used a rate-distortion criterion to decide which packet 
within  the  window  to  request  at  each  request  opportunity.   
Because a packet is small, the time to transmit  it is generally 
small  in  comparison  to  the  round  trip  time.  Moreover,  the 
packet  could  be  lost  or  delayed,  creating  uncertainty  about 
whether  it  would  be  received  by  the  decoding  deadline,  and 
therefore uncertainty about whether other packets that depend 
on it would have any value.    These factors forced [5] to use a 
relatively complex Markov decision process to  make its rate-
distortion decisions. In the present paper, we take an analogous 
window-based approach to rate-utility optimized streaming, but 
instead  of  requesting  a  single  packet  at  a  time,  our  CBM 
requests large chunks of data at a time from a web server. The 
return of  the  data can be  modeled as happening immediately, 
because  the  round  trip  time  is  negligible  compared  to  the 
transmission  time.  Furthermore,  the  requested  data  can  be

head,  or  picks  up  an  object  to  examine  it,  a  portion  of  the 
content, which until that moment may have been streaming at 
low resolution, is immediately required to be displayed at high 
resolution.    The  same  thing  can  happen  with  a  handheld 
display,  for  example  when  an  object  is  streamed  to  a  mobile 
phone, and the user suddenly spins the object around or zooms 
in to see a portion of the object at higher resolution. 

In traditional streaming, the buffer is a queue.    The length 
of  the  queue  in  terms  of  seconds  of  content  in  the  buffer  is 
typically on the order of five seconds (or over 90 seconds in the 
case of a typical buffer-based algorithm), to make the streaming 
robust  to  underflow  in  the  event  of  an  unforeseen  drop  in 
network throughput.    Unfortunately, a long queue means that 
the user experiences a long delay between her action (e.g., head 
turn) and a change in the level of fidelity or resolution needed 
in response.    This is unacceptable in AR and VR applications, 
where user interaction is frequent.   

Our  solution  is  to  eliminate  the  notion  of  the  buffer  as  a 
queue.  Instead,  we  treat  the  buffer  as  an  interval,  or  window, 
that  advances  over  the  media  presentation  timeline.    The 
leading  edge  of  the  window  corresponds  to  the  tail  of  the 
traditional  queue,  where  groups  of  frames  (GOFs)  are 
traditionally  inserted,  while  the  trailing  edge  of  the  window 
corresponds to the head of the traditional queue, where GOFs 
are traditionally extracted for decoding and playback. However, 
a window-based CBM may ask the server for any GOFs inside 
the window, not just a GOF at the leading edge of the window.   
Moreover,  a  window-based  CBM  may  ask  for  a  GOF  in  the 
window that has already been transmitted and may be sitting in 
the buffer at a low resolution. For example, the CBM may ask 
for a higher resolution version of a GOF that is about to exit the 
trailing edge of the window and be played back to the user, even 
if it already exists in the buffer at a lower resolution. In this way, 
a  window-based  CBM is able to respond  with low latency  to 
unexpected user interactions.

Period  contains  all  content  within  a  certain  duration.   
There may be multiple Periods. 

AdaptationSet contains content that can be selected by 
the user (or programmatically by the user’s agent) to be played 
during the period. In standard DASH, each AdaptationSet is 
typically  a  video,  audio  language  1,  or  audio  language  2.   
When  extended  to  volumetric  media,  each  AdaptationSet 
may contain a single dynamic hologram (i.e., an object) or its 
audio  track.    An  AdaptationSet  is  either  selected  or  not 
selected in its entirety. If the  AdaptationSet is a hologram, 
maxwidth is the width of the bounding cube of the hologram 
in  voxels,  maxFrameRate  is  the  maximum  frame  rate  of  the 
hologram,  cubeToObject  is  the  transformation  from  the 
bounding cube coordinate system into the  object’s coordinate 
system, tileWidth is the width of each tile in voxels (relative 
to maxwidth), startTime is the media start time (𝜏0) within 
the  period,  mimeType is  a  new  MIME  type/subtype  such  as 
holo/hvr, and codecs is the name of the codec. 

SegmentTemplate is the template for all the segments in 
the AdaptationSet. Duration is the length of each segment 
(in timescale units).    Media is the template in a text format 
such as 

ObjectName_$bandwidth$_$width$_$framerate$_$nu
mber$.hvr 

StartNumber is the $number$ of the first segment, typically 
0.    $bandwidth$, $width$, and $framerate$ indicate the 
representation used. 

Representation  contains 

the 
representations  available  for  the  AdaptationSet. 
  The 
information  includes  id  (a  text  description),  bandwidth, 

information  about

orange 
modeled  as  returning  with  certainty,  because  the  data  are 
transmitted over a reliable protocol (HTTP/TCP). This greatly 
simplifies  the  decision  logic  in  the  CBM.  The  rate-utility 
optimization algorithm that we use in this paper is optimal, but 
it reduces to a simple greedy algorithm, as explained in Section 
V.   

B.  Multiple objects 

In  streaming  holograms,  unlike  streaming  video  or  even 
streaming  spherical  video,  it  may  be  common  to  stream 
multiple objects simultaneously. Each object represents a single 
performance, such as a single person performing a single pose.   
In  general,  multiple  objects  will  be  streamed  together  and 
composited  at  the  client.  The  client  must  know  how  to 
composite  the  objects  by  spatio-temporal  transformations, 
which  are  specified  elsewhere.  The  objects  may  come  from 
different web servers.   

In  our  framework,  each  of  the  objects  that  play  back 
simultaneously  may  have  a  different  seek  time  𝜏0   and 
playback  speed  𝜈 .  However,  all  such  objects  are  assumed  to 
begin playback at a common user time  𝑡0  and have a common 
window function  Δ𝑊(𝑡). Thus the windows onto each object 
may have different media times, but they coincide in user time. 

C.  File format 

Here  we  outline  a  possible  file  structure  consistent  with 
DASH, with some extensions or modifications (noted in italics) 
to  handle  tiled  holograms.    Other  file  structures  are  also 
possible. 

Fig. 4 shows the structure of files available on the server.   

There are three types of files: manifests, segments, and segment 
indices.    The  manifest  for  an  object  is  the  meta  data  for  the 
object, as it contains a list of all the other files for the  object, 
and  their  properties.    The  segments  contain  the  data  of  the 
object, as they are the elements of a temporal partition of the 
object’s media into intervals of equal duration.    Each segment 
comes in various representations, which are different qualities, 
spatial resolutions, or temporal resolutions.    A segment index 
accompanies each segment, to index into representations, GOFs, 
and tiles of the segment.    These file types are now described 
in detail. 

Manifest 

The  manifest  for  an  object  comprises  the  object’s 
properties, a list of its representations, and a schema or template 
for  mapping  a  desired  time  segment  and  representation  to  a 

width (i.e., the number of voxels across the bounding cube, in 
this representation), and framerate to indicate the bandwidth 
and level of detail (LOD) of the representation. 

Segment 

The  segment  ObjectName_$bandwidth$_$width$_ 
$framerate$_$number$.hvr is the chunk of the media file 
containing an encoding of the  object from time ($number$ - 
startnumber)  *  duration  up  to  but  not  including  time 
($number$  -  startnumber  +  1)  *  duration,  in  the 
representation  with  the  given  $bandwidth$,  $width$,  and 
$framerate$.    An initial segment can also be specified. 

A  segment  consists  of  a  sequence  of  GOFs  (groups  of 
frames).    Each  GOF  consists  of  an  optional  GOF  header 
followed by a sequence of tiles.    Tiles that contain content are 
occupied.    Only occupied tiles appear in each GOF.    The tiles 
appear in Morton order, and are indexed by their Morton codes.   
The Morton code of a tile is the interleaving of the bits for the 
coefficients of the tile’s position  𝑥,  𝑦, and  𝑧  in the bounding 
cube coordinate system. 

Segment Index 

There  is  one  segment  index  file  for  each  segment.    The 
segment index is an index into its associated segment and all of 
its  representations.    The  segment  index  will  be  used  by  the 
client to identify particular representations for particular tiles in 
particular GOFs in the segment.    The segment index needs to 
be  compact,  and  (like  the  segment)  is  a  binary  file.    If  a 
segment is stored in a file 

ObjectName_$bandwidth$_$width$_$framerate$_$nu
mber$.hvr 

then the segment index can be stored in an associated file 

ObjectName_$number$.idx 

(or in another file designated by a filename extension decided a 
priori). 

The  segment index contains  pointers to the GOFs and to 
the tiles of the segment, so that the tiles for each GOF can be 
downloaded  independently  as  desired.    The  segment  index 
information includes: 
gofCount 
Gof[gofCount] 
startTime 
duration 
frameCount 
tileCount  
Tile[tileCount] 
mortonCode  
normalCode 

Representation[representationCount] 

gofByteOffsetInSegment 
gofHeaderByteCount 
Tile[tileCount] 

byteCount 

StartTime  is  the  start  time  of  the  GOF;  duration  is  its 
duration.    FrameCount is the number of frames in the GOF.   

each 

representation  of 

TileCount is the number of tiles in the GOF.    MortonCode 
is the Morton code for a tile.    NormalCode is a code for the 
dominant  normal  direction  of  the  tile.    Both  position  and 
normal direction may be used to  test whether a tile is visible.   
For 
segment,  GofByte 
OffsetInSegment is the byte offset of the GOF in the file for 
its  segment  and  representation,  GofHeaderByteCount  is  its 
size,  and  Tile[n].byteCount  is  the  size  of  the  nth  tile.   
Note that all representations for a segment have the same GOF 
and  tile  structure.    Only  byte  offsets  and  counts  may  be 
index  files  for  different 
different  across 
representations of the same segment. 

the  segment 

the 

If  visibility  testing  is  not  required,  there  need  be  only  a 
single tile (the whole cube, having Morton code 0). If visibility 
testing  is  desired,  there  may  be  hundreds  of  tiles  per  GOF, 
depending  on  the  granularity  of  the  visibility  testing.    Even 
with  a  hundred  tiles,  four  representations,  32  bits  per 
mortonCode and byteoffset, and GOF size of 4 frames, the 
bitrate  for  the  segment  index  should  be  at  most  only  about 
100*(32+4*32)*30/4  =  120  Kbps,  which  is  about  1%  of  a 
typical  total  bit  rate.    However,  we  may  wish  to  have  many 
frames per GOF, few tiles per GOF, and few representations to 
keep the segment index bitrate as low as possible. Or the client 
can fetch only the relevant parts of the segment index (e.g., for 
low-bitrate representations). 

When  subsets  of  nearby  tiles  are  accessed,  they  can  be 
grouped together into a single byte range, as part of a multi-part 
byte range request for the tiles in the segment.    This is made 
efficient by having the tiles in Morton order. 

D.  Client buffer manager interfaces 

The client buffer manager (CBM) has two interfaces: one 
to the web server or CDN and one to the playback engine (PE). 

The  interface  between  the  CBM  and  the  web  server  is 
solely  through  HTTP  requests,  for  efficiency  preferably 
HTTP/2 [48], which allows the client to communicate with the 
server in a binary format to create multiple streams that can be 
prioritized  and  for  dependencies  between  streams  all  over  a 
single connection. 

The  interface  between  the  CBM  and  the  PE  could  be 

something like the following. 

•  The  PE  tells  the  CBM  the  URLs  of  the  manifests  of  the 
objects  that  it  wishes  to  stream,  the  seek  time,  the  playback 
speed, and whether to loop or not.    It also provides initial user 
point(s)  of  view  in  world  coordinates  (i.e.,  3D  user  position, 
azimuth, elevation, and horizontal FOV).    Finally, it provides 
some device resolution information: pixels across the horizontal 
FOV.    The  latter  is  used  to  evaluate  the  utility  of  different 
levels of detail. 

•  The  CBM  opens  the  manifests,  downloads  the  initial 
segment and the segment index of the first segment(s) of each 
representation  of  each  object,  downloads  the  lowest  bitrate 
representation of the objects for a default period of media time 
(e.g.,  𝜈   seconds),  places  the  received  representations  in  the 

buffer, and notifies the PE that at least  𝜈  seconds of content is 
in the buffer so that it can begin playback. 

•  The PE notifies the CBM every time it pulls something out 
of the buffer, so that the CBM can update the head of the buffer. 

•  The  PE also notifies the CBM  of any change  in  the  user 
frustum or frusta, which will be any time the user updates his or 
her position or look direction relative to the object. 

•  The CBM will continue to download content into the buffer.   
It  will  notify  the  PE  on  any  significant  change  to  the  buffer.   
For example, if the PE tries to access the buffer and it is empty 
(but not yet EOF), then the buffer underflows.    The CBM will 
notify the PE when there is once again  𝜈  seconds in the buffer 
to begin playback. 

E.  Client buffer manager operation 

At the core of the operation of the CBM is a data structure 

for the buffer that mirrors the structure of the files on the server.   
There is an array of objects.    Each object contains information 
from the  manifest, and an array of segments.    Each segment 
contains  an  array  of  GOFs.    Each  GOF  contains  an  array  of 
(occupied) tiles.    Thus in this data structure a tile is not only 
spatial but also temporal (as an element of a GOF in a segment) 
and  is  furthermore  associated  with  an  object.    Each  tile  (in 
each  object,  segment,  and  GOF)  contains  the  utility[𝑚 ]  and 
bitCount[𝑚] for each representation  𝑚 = 1, … , 𝑀  of the  tile, 
and  contains  the  selected  representation  𝑛   of  the  tile.    The 
initial representation  𝑛  is set to 0, meaning that the tile initially 
has no representation, and by convention utility[0] = bitCount[0] 
= 0.    Once the representation for a tile is actually fetched, then 
the tile also contains the fetched data.    The CBM may request 
a newer (better) representation for a tile at any time, in which 
case the older representation of the tile is overwritten. 

The representation of a tile at the current playback time is 
fed to the PE to decode and render.    Although not illustrated 
in the pseudo code in the Appendix, it is possible for the PE to 
loop playback, in which case the CBM will continue to upgrade 
the representations on every subsequent pass until there are no 
more upgrades possible. 

The CBM thread begins when the CBM is notified by the 
PE to begin playback.    The, the CBM downloads the manifests 
of  the  specified  objects,  determines  the  initial  segments, 
downloads  the  indexes  for  those  initial  segments,  determines 
the GOFs required to play the first  𝜈  seconds of each object, 
requests the lowest bitrate representation for all the tiles in those 
GOFs, and waits to receive the requested data from the server.   
When the data are received, the start time  𝑡0  is declared, and 
the CBM notifies the PE to begin playback.    From that point 
on, the “buffer” at time  𝑡 ≥ 𝑡0  is the set of all tiles for which 
data has been received (in all GOFs in all segments in all objects) 
whose media times are within the window (shown in Fig. 3) at 
time  𝑡.    Furthermore,  from  that  point  on,  the  PE  on  its  own 
thread extracts data from the buffer at the trailing edge of the 
window and decodes it for presentation. 

Beginning at time  𝑡0, the CBM enters a request-wait cycle, 

with the CBM requesting data from the server at each request 
opportunity  𝑡𝑖,  𝑖 = 0,1,2, …, and between requests, waiting for 
the  data  to  be  returned.    At  each  request,  the  CBM  requests 
just enough data so that the expected length of time for the data 
to be transmitted from the server to the client (the “on” part of 
the cycle) is  𝑇  seconds.  𝑇  is chosen large enough so that the 
length of time for the request to go out to the server (the “off” 
part of the cycle) is a negligible fraction of the cycle, so that 
that  the  downlink  bandwidth  is  nearly  fully  utilized.    At  the 
same  time,  𝑇   should  be  small  enough  so  that  the  client  can 
quickly  adapt  to  unexpected  changes  in  the  network  or  user 
behavior.    We use  𝑇 = 0.5  seconds in our experiments. 

From the CBM point of view, all the action happens at the 
request opportunities. Between request opportunities, the CBM 
simply  waits.    At  request  opportunity  𝑡𝑖 ,  the  CBM  first 
estimates  the  network  throughput  𝐶𝑖    by  smoothing  the 
instantaneous  estimate  𝐶̂𝑖 = 𝑅𝑖−1/(𝑡𝑖 − 𝑡𝑖−1) ,  where  𝑅𝑖−1   is 
the number of bits requested at the previous request opportunity.   
A typical way to smooth the instantaneous throughput estimates 
is  with  a  first-order  autoregressive  filter,  𝐶𝑖 = 𝑤𝐶𝑖−1 +
(1 − 𝑤)𝐶̂𝑖, for some weight depending on the memory of the 
network.    We use  𝑤 = 0.75  in our experiments.    This gives 
a bit budget of  𝑅𝑖 = 𝐶𝑖𝑇  for the current request. 

Given the bit budget  𝑅𝑖  for the request, which tiles (within 
the  window)  and  their  representations  to  request  are  decided 
based on maximizing an expected “utility” to the user, subject 
to the bit budget.    Specifically, if  𝒲  is the list of tiles in the 
window,  𝒩 = {𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒. 𝑛}  is the list of current representations for 
the 
list  of 
representations for the tiles in  𝒲  after the request is fulfilled, 
the CBM chooses  ℳ  to maximize the total utility 

in  𝒲  ,  and  ℳ = {𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒. 𝑚}    is 

tiles 

the 

𝑈(ℳ) = ∑ 𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒. 𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦[𝑡𝑖𝑙𝑒. 𝑚]                        (2)

from 

tile.m  differ 

representations 

Note that the latter sum is only over tiles in the window whose 
future 
the  current 
representation  tile.n,  since  only  then  will  the  representation 
tile.m have to be requested from the server and its size in bits 
count towards the bit budget. A request for a new representation 
is made, if possible, by combining the requests for all tiles in 
the  same  segment  with  that  representation  into  one  multipart 
byte range request. 

At  every  request  opportunity,  the  trailing  edge  of  the 
window  (i.e.,  the  current  playback  time)  advances  by  some 
amount (namely the time that has elapsed since the last request 
opportunity), and the leading edge of the window also advances 
by the same amount (or a greater amount, at the beginning of 
playback, when the window size is still growing). Most of the 
requested tiles will fall into the part of the window that is newly 
opened. However, tiles may still be requested in other parts of 

 
the  window,  especially  if  there  is  a  surge  of  new  bit  rate 
available, of if the user viewpoint moves and causes new tiles 
to become visible. The CBM is able to get these newly visible 
tiles within  𝑇  seconds, as it is not restricted to requesting tiles 
only at the leading edge of the window. 

The utility of a tile is a function of (among other things) the 
user’s view pose and frustum, which are passed from the PE to 
the CBM and must be kept updated as the user moves.    If the 
user  suddenly  move  her  head,  the  utility  of  some  tiles  may 
increase, causing them to get higher priority and hence causing 
the CBM to request them in a higher quality or resolution than 
they received than at any previous request opportunity. How the 
utility  is  calculated  is  detailed  in  Section  IV,  and  how  the 
maximization is performed is detailed in Section V. 

IV.  UTILTY MEASURES 

The  utility  of  a  tile  depends  on  how  much  useful 
information  it  brings  to  the  user. This  depends  in  turn  on  the 
relationship of the tile to the viewpoint of the user, as illustrated 
in Fig. 5. If a tile is outside the viewpoint of the user, then it has 
no utility. If it far away, then its utility may be low because it 
covers a small area. On the other hand, as the tile moves quite 
close, then its utility may saturate because its spatial resolution 
is intrinsically finite.    And of course a tile coded with a higher 
bitrate  will  generally  have  a  higher  spatial  resolution,  higher 
temporal  resolution,  and/or  higher  PSNR.  Unfortunately,  the 
utility of a tile in the far future is uncertain, because the user’s 
viewpoint in the future is uncertain. Hence in principle one can 
evaluate only the expected utility of a future tile. To complicate 
matters, frequently there are multiple points of view, certainly 
in stereoscopic systems, but possibly also in multi-user systems. 

We model the (expected) utility of a tile as a function of the 
bandwidth of the representation selected for the tile, weighted 
both by the number of distinguishable voxels in the tile and by 
the  probability  that  the  tile  will  be  visible  (i.e.,  in  the  user’s 
frustum and facing the user) when it is decoded and rendered. 

To be more specific, we change notation from the previous 
section.    For  tile  𝑘 ,  with  representation  𝑛𝑘 ,  and  viewpoints 
𝑣 ∈ 𝒱, the utility  𝑈𝑘(𝑛𝑘)  of the tile is given by 

𝑈𝑘(𝑛𝑘) = 𝑢(𝐵𝑛𝑘) × max
𝑣∈𝒱

{𝐿𝑂𝐷𝑘(𝑛𝑘, 𝑣) × 𝑃𝑘(𝑣)}, 

indicating 

the  representation,  𝐿𝑂𝐷𝑘(𝑛𝑘, 𝑣)    is 

where  𝑢(𝐵)    is  a  function 
the  utility  per 
distinguishable voxel of the tile as a function of the bandwidth 
the  number  of 
of 
distinguishable voxels of the tile if the tile is visible from the 
current viewpoint  𝑣, and  𝑃𝑘(𝑣)  is the probability that the tile 
would  visible  when  rendered,  if  the  current  viewpoint  is  𝑣 .   
The  latter  two  factors  depend  on  the  spatial  resolution  of  the 
representation, the size of the tile, the point of view relative to 
the tile, and  the  resolution  of the viewing device.    However, 
the only parameter that the CBM can control to maximize the 
utility is  𝑛𝑘. All three factors are described in detail next.   

the  bandwidth  of 

increasing  function  of 

an 
representation, as a proxy for the quality of the representation.   
Though the utility of quality to any given user is hard to quantify, 
in general it should be monotonically increasing, should flatten 
out  at  high  bitrates,  and  should  be  zero  when  nothing  is 
transmitted. Thus we model the utility as an affine function of 
the logarithm,

representations  𝑚 = 1, … , 𝑀. These coefficients are then kept 
constant  for  the  duration  of  playback.  Many  Mean  Opinion 
Score (MOS) tests frequently show such a logarithmic pattern 
[49].   

B.  Distinguishable voxels in a tile 

We model the number of distinguishable voxels in a tile as 
the number of distinguishable voxels in the square area roughly 
covered  by  the  tile,  that  is,  the  number  of  degrees  of  view 
linearly  across  the  tile  times  the  number  of  distinguishable 
voxels per degree of view linearly across the tile, squared.    In 
turn, the number of degrees of view  linearly across the tile is 
approximately the width of the tile divided by the distance  of 
the tile from the viewpoint (times  180/𝜋).    Furthermore, the 
number  of  distinguishable  voxels  per  degree  of  view  linearly 
across  the  tile  is  the  minimum  of  the  number  of  voxels  per 
degree of view linearly across the tile and the number of pixels 
per  degree  of  view  across  the  display.    This  information  is 
computed based on the user’s view pose and frustum, and the 
display resolution, passed to the CBM from the PE. 

To be specific, let the width of the tile in the real world be 
the width of the tile in voxels (object.tileWidth) times its cube-
to-world scale (object.cubeToObjectScale), and let the field of 
view of the tile (in radians) at unit distance be approximated by 
its real-world width.    Let position of the tile in the real world 
be  its  (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧)   position  in  voxels  (as  determined  from  its 
Morton 
translation 
(object.cubeToObject plus object-to-world translations), and let 
the  distance  to  the  position  of  the  tile  from  viewpoint  𝑣   be 
𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡(𝑣). Then the approximate field of view across the tile in 
radians is

is  the  number  of  distinguishable  voxels  in  the  square  area 
roughly covered by the tile.   

C.  Probability that a tile will be visible 

The last part of the utility model is the probability  𝑃𝑘(𝑣) 
that if the current viewpoint is  𝑣  then tile  𝑘  will be visible at 
by  the  time  the  tile  emerges  from  the  trailing  edge  of  the 
window and is displayed to the user. 

The  uncertainty  of  whether  tile  𝑘   will  be  visible  by  the 
time  it  emerges  from  the  window  is  due,  of  course,  to  the 
uncertainty  of  the  user’s  behavior  in  the  interim.    If  the 
viewpoint of the user could be accurately predicted, then  𝑃𝑘(𝑣) 
could be set close to 0 or 1. If it were close to 0, then the utility 
of the tile  would be close to 0, and no bits  would  need to be 
wasted transmitting the tile. The bits could be used instead to 
improve the quality of tiles for which  𝑃𝑘(𝑣)  is close to 1. 

Thus,  for AR  streaming,  user  prediction  is  an  important 
problem,  just  as  network  prediction  is  important  for  all 
streaming.  User  adaptivity  and  network  adaptivity  are 
analogous. The  problem of  user prediction is therefore a new 
area for research in AR streaming. 

  In this paper, however, we keep the user prediction model 

very simple. Specifically, we predict that if a tile  𝑘  has media 
time  𝜏𝑘, it will be visible to the user when it emerges from the 
window if its position is visible to the user in the current view 
𝑣  at time  𝑡, with prediction error probability 0.1 if the tile is 
early  in  the  window  (close  to  the  trailing  edge  𝑊𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙(𝑡) ), 
increasing linearly to 0.4 if the tile is late in the window (close 
to the leading edge  𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡) = 𝑊𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙(𝑡) + Δ𝑊(𝑡)).    That is,

Where  𝑃𝑘
This  is  a  simple  model  of  increasing  uncertainty  of  what  the 
user will be looking at further away in time.    Undoubtedly the 
model can be easily improved using machine learning.   

V.  UTILITY MAXIMIZATION 

In  this  section,  we  present  an  algorithm  for  utility 
maximization that is greedy yet provably optimal.    To begin, 
let us re-write the constrained maximization problem (2) and (3) 
as maximizing 

𝐾
𝑈(ℳ) = ∑ 𝑈𝑘(𝑚𝑘)
𝑘=1

𝐾
𝑅(ℳ) = ∑ 𝑏𝑘(𝑚𝑘)
𝑘=1

≤ 𝑅𝑖, 

where  ℳ = {𝑚1, … , 𝑚𝐾}  are  the  representations  for  all  tiles 
1, … , 𝐾  in the window, and  𝑏𝑘(𝑚)  is the number of bits that 
would  be  required  to  get  representation  𝑚   for  tile  𝑘 .    If 
𝑚 = 𝑛𝑘 ,  the  representation  for  tile  𝑘   that  is  already  in  the 
buffer, then  𝑏𝑘(𝑛𝑘) = 0,  because it takes no additional bits to 
get representation  𝑛𝑘  for tile  𝑘.    If there is no representation 
for tile  𝑘  yet in the buffer, then  𝑛𝑘 = 0  and still  𝑏𝑘(0) = 0.   
By convention,  𝑈𝑘(0) = 0. 

Because we can restrict our search for the optimal  ℳ  to 
the  upper  convex  hull  𝒮̂    of 
the  set  of  points  𝒮 =
{(𝑅(ℳ), 𝑈(ℳ))}   in  the  rate-utility  plane 2 ,  we  can  instead 
solve the easier problem of maximizing the Lagrangian 

𝐾
𝑈(ℳ) − 𝜆𝑅(ℳ) = ∑[𝑈𝑘(𝑚𝑘) − 𝜆𝑏𝑘(𝑚𝑘)]
𝑘=1

for some  𝜆 > 0.    Moreover,   

2  Not only does the convex hull  𝒮̂  outperforms  𝒮  in the sense that for any 
point  (𝑅, 𝑈) ∈ 𝒮, there exists a dominating point  (𝑅̂, 𝑈̂) ∈ 𝒮̂  such that    𝑅̂ ≤

𝑅  and  𝑈̂ ≥ 𝑈, but also every point on  𝒮̂  can be achieved with timesharing or 
randomization between points in  𝒮.

for tile  𝑘  lies on the upper convex hull  𝒮̂𝑘  of the set of points 
𝒮𝑘 = {(𝑏𝑘(𝑚), 𝑈𝑘(𝑚))}   in  the  rate-utility  plane,  and  the 
points on the vertices of the convex hull are swept out in order 
of increasing  𝑏𝑘(𝑚)  as  𝜆  decreases from infinity to zero.

As  an  example,  Fig.  6  shows  (with  the  tile  index  𝑘 
rate-utility  points  𝒮 =

a 

{(𝑏(𝑚), 𝑈(𝑚)): 𝑚 = 0, … ,5} ,  with  index  0  corresponding  to 
the  null  representation  and  indices  1-5  corresponding  to  five 
representations  for  the  tile’s  object  in  order  of  increasing 
object.bandwidth[m]. Points 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 lie on the upper 
convex  hull  𝒮̂   in  order  of  increasing  𝑏(𝑚) .    Let  𝜆01 ,  𝜆12 , 
𝜆24, and  𝜆45  be the slopes of the line segments between these 
points on  𝒮̂.    Then the optimal representation for this tile for 
any given  𝜆  is 

𝑚(𝜆) =

0
𝜆01 < 𝜆 < ∞
1 𝜆12 < 𝜆 ≤ 𝜆01
2 𝜆24 < 𝜆 ≤ 𝜆12
4 𝜆45 < 𝜆 ≤ 𝜆24
0 ≤ 𝜆 ≤ 𝜆45
5

. 

{

For  this  tile,  𝜆01   is  a  threshold  for  𝜆   above  which  no 
representation  is  requested.    The  maximum  such  threshold 
across  all  tiles  is  a  threshold  for  𝜆    above  which  no 
representations  are  requested  for  any  tiles.    As  𝜆   decreases 
from this threshold,  𝑏𝑘(𝑚𝑘(𝜆))  increases for every tile  𝑘, and 
hence  𝑅(ℳ)  also increases.    Thus  𝜆  can be decreased step-
by-step  until  the  constraint  𝑅(ℳ) ≤ 𝑅𝑖   would  be  violated.   
For this  value of  𝜆, the representation  𝑚𝑘(𝜆)  for tile  𝑘  can 
be requested from the server if  𝑚𝑘(𝜆) > 0.    This is our basic 
rate-utility optimization algorithm.   

One modification to the basic algorithm is crucial to be able 
to  update,  at  a  request  opportunity  𝑡𝑖,  the  representation  of  a 
tile that remains in the window and already has a representation 
from request opportunity  𝑡𝑖−1, for example, if the tile suddenly 
increases in utility because the user has turned to look at it.    In 
the  modification,  the  representation  of  tile  𝑘   from  previous 

 
 
 
 
request  opportunities  is  saved  in  variable  𝑛𝑘 ,  and  𝑏𝑘(𝑛𝑘)   is 
set  to  0,  the  rationale  being  that  to  obtain  representation  𝑛𝑘 
again at the current request opportunity would take 0 bits.    The 
utility  𝑈𝑘(𝑛𝑘)   is  left  unchanged.  With  this  modification,  the 
initial point on the upper convex hull for tile  𝑘  is  (0, 𝑈𝑘(𝑛𝑘)) 
rather  than  (0,0) .    This  raises  the  initial  point  of  the  upper 
convex hull, thus flattening the convex hull, making it difficult 
to  reach  other  representations  along  the  upper  convex  hull 
unless  𝜆  is allowed to become large (e.g., if the estimated bit 
budget  𝑅𝑖   suddenly  becomes  large)  or  unless  some  other 
representation  suddenly  increases  in  utility  (e.g.,  if  the  user 
turns her head to look at the tile).    The full algorithm is shown 
in Table 1, and illustrated in Fig. 7.

VI.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

In this section, we first evaluate the network-adaptivity of 
our  window-based  algorithm,  in  the  absence  of  any  user 
interaction.    Following that, we evaluate the user-adaptivity of 
our algorithm. 

A.  Network-adaptivity evaluation 

We  compare  our  window-based  algorithm  (WBA)  with 
throughput-based and buffer-based algorithms (TBA and BBA) 
by  stripping out of  our algorithm the  ability  to deal  with  any 
user interaction, including rate-utility optimization. What is left 
is  an  algorithm  that  at  each  request  opportunity  𝑡𝑖  puts  just-
received  content  at  the  end  of  the  queue,  and  requests  new 
content  whose  media  time  𝜏   is  expected  to  be  newly 
uncovered by the leading edge of the window at time  𝑡𝑖+1, that

is,  𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡𝑖) < 𝜏 ≤ 𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡𝑖 + 𝑇). The  bandwidth  𝐵𝑖  of  the 
representation of the content requested at time  𝑡𝑖  is the highest 
bandwidth available less than

. 

(6) 

where  𝐶𝑖   is  the  network  throughput  estimated  at  time  𝑡𝑖 .   
Thus  the  client  will  request  more  data  when  the  estimated 
throughput is high and the current buffer pointer  𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡𝑖)  is 
close  to  the  target  buffer  pointer  𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡𝑖 + 𝑇).    The  buffer 
occupancy, which is the amount of media time in the queue, at 
any given time  𝑡  is  𝑊𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑑(𝑡) − 𝑊𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑙(𝑡)  in this case.   

is  deterministically  controlled 

All  three  algorithms  (WBA,  TBA,  and  BBA)  are  tested 
under the same network conditions, which are a combination of 
random  and  deterministic  processes.  Specifically,  the  packet 
arrival process is modeled as a Poisson random process whose 
to  model 
mean  value 
environmental factors such as service providers, traffic patterns, 
and wireless technologies. The throughput of wireless networks, 
for example, depends on the channel conditions and density of 
users.    In  this  paper,  we  consider  two  different  scenarios.   
The first scenario (Fig. 9(a)) is a stable network in which the 
mean packet arrival rate is constant. If the client is connected to 
the Internet through a wired network and there are only a few 
users, the network throughput may be very stable. The second 
scenario  (Fig.  9(b))  is  a  variable  network  in  which  the  mean 
packet arrival rate changes frequently. If the client is connected 
to the Internet through a wireless network and there are many 
users  within  a  small  area  competing  for  the  same  wireless 
network  resources,  the  network  throughput  may  be  very 
unstable.   

Fig  10.  shows  simulation  results  for  the  stable  network 
condition.  The  proposed  algorithm  (WBA)  is  compared  with 
the  throughput-based  algorithm  (TBA)  and  the  buffer-based 
algorithm (BBA). The first row shows the buffer occupancy in 
GOFs and the second row shows the bandwidth selection results. 
There are 5 representations on the server, at bandwidths C1, C2, 
C3,  C4,  and  C5  (4Mbps,  8Mbps,  12Mbps,  16Mbps,  and 
20Mbps respectively). The buffer occupancy of TBA increases 
continuously  because  it  selects  a  representation  with  slightly 
lower  bitrate  than  the  estimated  throughput.  However,  it 
neglects  the  buffer  status,  and  it  make  the  buffer  occupancy 
increase, which means that it forfeits the chance to select better 
representations after the buffer becomes large. In contrast, the 
buffer occupancy of BBA stops growing and it chooses better

representations. When the buffer occupancy  is large, it drives 
the  client  to  request  better  representations  with  higher 
bandwidths. The proposed algorithm shows a pattern similar to 
that of BBA, but it has better average throughput than both TBA 
and  BBA,  because  it  considers  the  estimated  throughput  and 
buffer occupancy at the same time.   

Fig 11. shows simulation results  for the variable network 
condition. The proposed algorithm again achieves the highest 
average  bitrate  (8.6  Mbps  compared  to  6.91  Mbps  and  5.26 
Mbps), and furthermore there are no stall (buffer underflow or 
rebuffering) events. TBA and BBA also do not have any buffer 
underflow  events,  because  TBA  chooses  bitrates  that  are 
smaller  than  the  estimated  throughput,  and  BBA  tries  to 
increase  the  buffer  occupancy  rather  than  receiving  higher 
bitrates. BBA needs a  much larger buffer occupancy  than the 
proposed method to prevent rebuffering events.   

The  point  of  this  study  is  not  to  show  that  the  proposed 
WBA is superior to the commonly used TBA or BBA, but rather 
to show that WBA is state-of-the-art from a network adaptation 
point  of  view,  and  that  it  does  not  give  up  any  ability  to  be 
network-adaptive while also being user-adaptive.   

B.  User-adaptivity evaluation 

We  next  investigate  the  performance  of  the  proposed 
method when users are moving or controlling the viewpoint in 
AR applications. Deterministically generated camera paths are 
used to model user behavior. The camera path-1 (Fig. 12) starts 
far from the object and get close to the object, which models the 
zoom-in  and  zoom-out.  The  camera  path-2  (Fig.  13)  moves 
around  an  object  seeing  the  object.  This  is  for  modeling  the 
rotation of an object in a client’s display. As camera move close 
to the object, smaller number of tiles is visible and those tiles 
should have higher quality.     

To see the advantages of using the proposed algorithm for 
tile-based streaming, utility values are measured with different 
tile  sizes.  Fig.  14.  shows  simulation  results  for  the  stable 
network condition, and Fig 15. shows simulation results for the 
variable  network  condition.  Depth  indicates  the  number  of 
dyadic divisions of cube to form tiles. With smaller tile sizes, 
we can achieve better utility in both cases, since we can allocate 
more bits to only visible tiles. Simulation results with a moving 
camera  are  provided 
the  visibility  adaptation 
performance  of  the  proposed  algorithm.  We  perform  the 
simulations with two different speeds of camera movements to 
model slow and fast interactions.     

to  show 

Fig 12. Camera Path-1

(b) Fast interaction 

Simulation results show that the algorithm chooses higher 
bitrates  for  visible  tiles.  In  the  variable  network  condition, 
sometimes network throughput gets very bad, but the window-
based algorithm can tolerate the low throughput using existing 
data  in  the  buffer  and  requesting  lower  bitrates  to  save 
bandwidth. The buffer management algorithm takes advantage 
of GOPs that already exist in the buffer when the video clip is 
repeated, re-using such GOPs without requesting new data, or 
alternatively  upgrading 
to  a  higher  quality 
the  GOP 
representation. Using this  feature, the  client can continuously 
improve the quality of video. We can also see that the speed of 
camera  movement  does  not  affect  the  average  representation 
level of the visible parts. The average representation level of the 
visible parts is hardly degraded when the camera moves faster 
when smaller tiles are applied. However, we still can achieve 
better average representation level of the visible parts by using 
smaller  tiles,  because  it  helps  to  reduce  the  redundant  data 
streaming.   

The proposed algorithm can  be used for  multiple  objects 
without  changing  the  algorithm.  To  illustrate,  we  run  a 
simulation  with  five  objects.  Fig.  16  shows  the  location  of 
objects, and the camera path. The multiple objects compete for 
limited bandwidth.    Fig. 17. shows the estimated throughput, 
and the utility values of each object. The algorithm allocates the 
more bits to visible tiles of visible objects, since utility is high 
only when they are visible. However, the AR streaming system 
is always ready for a sudden change of user behavior. Therefore, 
the algorithm also requests non-visible tiles with lower quality 
to ensure that some data exists out of the user’s view. Moreover, 
as it repeats the video, the user receives more tiles with better

VII.  CONCLUSION 

This is the first paper, to our knowledge, to deal with on-
demand and/or live streaming of volumetric media for VR/AR 
applications.  The  main  new  aspect  of  streaming  volumetric 
content for VR/AR applications, compared to streaming video 
(or  even  spherical  video),  is  the  high  amount  of  user 
interactivity.    This  requires  the  streaming  to  be  not  only 
network-adaptive but also user-adaptive. Thus, new approaches 
are needed to minimize both network bandwidth and perceived 
latency due to user interaction.   

We  introduce  window-based  buffering  to  address  the 

problem  of  minimizing 
Window-based buffering, in contrast to queue-based buffering, 
allows data to be requested for any part of the window, not just 
at the end of the queue. Fundamentally, this makes it possible 

latency  after  user 

interaction.

Window-based buffering has been used before, in the early 
days  of  streaming,  for  packet-level  requests.  This  proved 
complicated, essentially because the round trip time (RTT) for 
a  packet  request  dominated  its  download  time,  and  packet 
delivery was not guaranteed. The uncertainty of having many 
required 
unreliable  packets 
sophisticated  tools  such  as  Markov  decision  processes  to 
optimize  the  packet  requests.    In  contrast,  in  our  system  we 
request  relatively  large  chunks  of  data  over  HTTP,  whose 
download  time  dominates  the  RTT  and  whose  delivery  is 
guaranteed.    Hence the requests can optimized serially.    We 
introduce a simple greedy yet provably optimal algorithm for 
maximizing  the  expected  utility  of  each  request  under  a  rate 
constraint.   

the  air  simultaneously 

We  introduce  3D  tiling  to  concentrate  network  resources 
on areas of interest to the user.    2D tiling has been used for a 
similar purpose in spherical video streaming. However, 3D tiles 
must be handled differently than 2D tiles because 1) there are 
polynomially many more 3D tiles than 2D tiles and 2) whether 
a  tile  is  occupied  by  content  or  not  is  content-dependent  and 
hence varying. We address both problems by creating a compact 
index into the set of occupied tiles in every group of frames. A 
further issue is that 3D tiles, unlike 2D tiles, may be occluded, 
depending on the viewpoint of the user. 

Finally,  we  develop  a  comprehensive  utility  measure  for 
each tile that takes into account the bitrate (as a proxy for the 
quality)  of  its  representation,  the  spatial  resolution  of  its 
representation, whether the tile is in the user’s view and facing 
the  user, the  distance  to the  user, the  spatial resolution of the 
display, and the time from when it is requested to when it will 
be displayed. We present a simple user prediction model, and 
pose a new research direction on user prediction modeling. 

Our  solution  to  volumetric  streaming  is  consistent  with

modern HTTP streaming and requires only minor modifications 
to, for example, DASH, such as information in the manifest to 
support  the  notion  of  a  volume  and  its  coordinate  system 
relative to the user, as well as tiles and segment indexes for the 
tiles.  Throughout  the  paper,  we  provide  details  of  how  our 
solution supports features such as 

•  State-of-the-art network-adaptivity, 
•  Tile-based culling depending on predicted user frustum to 

save bandwidth, 

•  Tile-based  level-of-detail  depending  on  predicted  user 
distance (and display resolution) to save bandwidth, 
•  Bandwidth  allocation  among  multiple  simultaneous 

objects, 

•  Sub-second response time to load new representations as 

necessary for user interaction, 

•  Fast start, 
•  Seek and fast-forward trick modes, and 
•  Quality improvement on subsequent replays if the data are 

stored. 

Simulation  results  show  that  even  in  the  absence  of  tiles 
and  rate-utility  optimization,  our  algorithm  has  both  higher 
throughput  and  fewer  rebuffering  events 
than  existing 
algorithms,  in  both  stable  and  variable  network  conditions.   
Simulation  results  also  show  that  our  algorithm  handles  user 
interaction for volumetric video as expected, with sub-second 
latency.
