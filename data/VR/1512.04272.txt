Abstract.  We  report  on  analysis  of  the  two-color  VR  CCD  observations  of  the 

newly  discovered  variable  2MASS  J18024395+4003309  =  VSX  J180243.9 

+400331  obtained  using  the  1-m  telescope  of  the  Mt.  Lemmon  Observatory 

(LOAO) in the field of the intermediate polar V1323 Her. The extended version of 

this  conference  talk  we  published  in  2015JASS...32..127A.  The  variability  was 

reported  in  2012OAP....25..150A,  and  the  object  was  monitored.  The  two-color 

observations  covered  all  phase  interval.  The  object  is  classified  as  an  Algol-type 

variable  with  tidally  distorted  components,  and  shows  an  asymmetry  of  the 

maxima  (the  O‘Connell  effect).  For  phenomenological  modeling,  we  used  the 

trigonometric  polynomial  approximation  of  statistically  optimal  degree,  and  a 

recent  method  “NAV"  (New  Algol  Variable)  using  local  specific  shapes  for  the 

eclipse. Methodological aspects are described, especially for the case of few color 

observations.  Estimates  of 

the  physical  parameters  based  on  analysis  of 

phenomenological parameters, are presented. 

Introduction 

For  the  phenomenological  modeling  of  eclipsing  binary  stars,  Andronov 

(2012a) proposed the “New Algol Variable” algorithm. It was also presented in the 

“Czestochowski  Kalendarz  Astronomizny  –  2013”  by  Andronov  (2012b).  The 

 
 
method  was  improved  for  the  case  of  unknown  period  and  initial  epoch,  which 

may be also independent variables, by Andronov et al (2015a). The applications to 

6 more stars was presented by Tkachenko et al. (2015). 

 The variability of the object 2MASS J18024395 +4003309, which is located 

in the field of the intermediate polar V1323 Her by Breus (2012). This object got a 

name  VSX  J180243.9+400331  (hereafter  shorter  VSX1802)  and  an  object 

identifier 282837. Unfortunately, no GCVS name is given to this object yet.  

Due to a relatively large angular distance (14’) from V1323 Her, VSX1802 

is  seen  in  the  field  of  V1323  Her  only  at  the  CCD  images  with  a  focal  reducer. 

This was the case  for one  night reported by  Andronov et al. (2012), who  noted a 

sharp  profile  of  the  minimum.  Additional  observations  from  the  Catalina    survey 

(Drake  et  al.  2009)  allowed 
T0=2456074.4904, P=0.3348837±0.0000002d.

to  determine  photometric  elements 

Observations and Periodogram  Analysis 

Due  to  the  installation  of  the  focal  reducer  at  the  1-m  telescope  of  the  Mt. 

Lemmon  Astronomical  Observatory,  Korea  (LOAO), 

the  field  of  CCD 

observations increased and allowed studies of objects in the field, in an addition to 

the  main  targets  (in  this  case,  the  intermediate  polar  V1343  Her).  Totally  we 
obtained 196 observations in V (range 16.51m – 17.51m) and 242 observations in R 
(range 15.88m – 16.77m). The total duration of observations was 45.5 hours during 

11  nights  in  R  and  8  nights  in  the  alternatively  changing  filters  VR.  To  improve 

accuracy  of  the  calibration,  we  have  used  the  method  of  “artificial  comparison 

star” (Andronov and Baklanov 2004, Kim et al. 2004). 

For the periodogram analysis, we have used the trigonometric polynomial fit 

of a degree s: 

(cid:1876)(cid:3004)((cid:1872)) = (cid:1829)(cid:2869) + ∑ ((cid:1829)(cid:2870)(cid:3037)

(cid:3046)
(cid:3037)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)

. cos 2(cid:2024)(cid:1858)(cid:1872) + (cid:1829)(cid:2870)(cid:3037)(cid:2878)(cid:2869)

. sin 2(cid:2024)(cid:1858)(cid:1872))

,                (1) 

where coefficients (cid:1829)(cid:3080), (cid:2009) = 1. . (cid:1865), (cid:1865) = 1 + 2(cid:1871) are computed using the least squares 

method and the  test function  (cid:1845)((cid:1858)) was used (cf. Andronov 1994, 2003), and f is 

frequency  (in  cycles/day)  .  For  eclipsing  binaries,  the  peaks  at  odd  multipliers  of 

the orbital frequency are typically much smaller than that for even multipliers. For 

 
the filters V and R, the peaks occur at similar values, which are close within error 

estimates to the value f=2.986111±0.000002 cycles/day (Andronov et al. 2012), so 

we adopted their ephemeris:  

Min I. BJD = 2456074.4904 + 0.3348837.E                     (2).  

We  confirm  cycle  numbering  and  mention  that  the  true  frequency  differs  by  a 

value of 0.5/year from the estimate based on 3 minima by Parimucha et al. (2012).  

To  determine  statistically  optimal  degree  s  of  approximation  (1),  we  have 

used  different  criteria  (see  Andronov  1994,  2003  for  detailed  discussion). 

According to the classical Fischer’s criterion, we got s=14 for the filter V and s=8 
for  R,  with  a  false  alarm  probability  of  FAP=10-3.  Criterion  of  the  best  r.m.s. 

accuracy  corresponds  to  s=6,  i.e.  much  smaller  value.  The  Gibbs  effect  causes 

apparent  waves  at  the  out-of-eclipse  part  of  the  light  curve,  which  are  not 

physically  justified.  In  the  trigonometric  polynomial  approximation  with  s=6,  the 

frequency  f  is  a  free  parameter  determined  using  differential  corrections 
(Andronov, 1994). The best fit estimate of periods is  P=  0.3348842d± 0.0000005d 
(filter V), 0.3348845d±0.0000004d (R). The difference from the value in (1) is not 
statistically significant, but a weighted mean is 0.3348844d±0.0000003. The mean 
moments of the primary minima are 2456238.9186 ± 0.0005d (V), 24 56320.9663± 
0.0007d  (R).  They  correspond  to  different  cycles,  as  the  nights  in  V  and  R  are 

generally  different,  and  Andronov  (1994)  argued  that  the  best  accuracy  estimates 

are for moments, which are closest to the sample mean of time. For such approach, 

there is no necessity that the moments should be in the interval of observations in 

some particular night. 

Phenomenological  vs. Physical Modeling 

For physical  modeling, usually the  method of Wilson and Devinney (1971) 

is  used,  which  was  realized  in  some  computer  programs  (e.g.  Zola  et  al.  1997, 

2010).  However,  for  the  majority  of  stars,  including  the  studied  one,  we  do  not 

have  spectroscopic  observations  needed  to  determine  the  mass  ratio  and 

temperatures.  So  one  may  try  to  make  estimates  using  phenomenological 

modeling. 

Using the NAV algorithm, we have determined approximations for a grid of 

values  of  the  eclipse  width  = (cid:1829) 8  with  a  determination  of  the  parameters 

describing the shape of eclipse   

(cid:1834)((cid:1878), (cid:2010)) = (cid:3420)(1 − |(cid:1878)|(cid:3081))(cid:2871)/(cid:2870),

if   |(cid:1878)| < 1
(cid:1) 

0                       else

The dimensionless variable z is related to phase  as  

(cid:1878) =

(cid:3435)(cid:2879)(cid:3116)(cid:3439)(cid:2879)(cid:2919)(cid:2924)(cid:2930)(cid:3435)(cid:2879)(cid:3116)(cid:2878)(cid:2868).(cid:2873)(cid:3439)


.   

For =0, the shape is narrow and is physically unrealistic, for =1, the shape at the 

center of eclipse is triangular, for =2 is parabolic, and for (cid:2010) → ∞ tends to a 

rectangle. 

Review on the methods for determination of the extrema was presented by 

Andronov (2005). The complete theory of statistical properties of the smoothing 

function in a case of arbitrary functions and additional (wavelet-like) time- and 

scale-dependent weight functions was presented by Andronov (1997). Other 

shapes for phenomenological modeling of eclipses based on modifications of the 

Gaussian are discussed by Mikulášek et al. (2012) and Mikulášek (2015). 

To get a single value of (cid:1829)8 for two filters, we made a scaled sum of the test 

functions 

(cid:2004)((cid:1829)(cid:2876)) =

(cid:2004)(cid:3023)((cid:1829)(cid:2876))
(cid:2004)(cid:3023),(cid:3040)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)

+

(cid:2004)(cid:3019)((cid:1829)(cid:2876))
(cid:2004)(cid:3019),(cid:3040)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)

and determined the filter half-width (cid:1829)(cid:2876)=0.1177 corresponding to a minimum.  

The classical phenomenological parameters listed in the GCVS (Samus et al. 
2014) were determined (Andronov et al. 2015a): Max I = 16.567m±0.006m, Max II 
=  16.592m±0.006m,  Min  I  =  17.493m±0.014m,  Min  II  =  17.281m±0.008m,  Min  I-
Max I= 0.926 m, Min II-Max I= 0.714 m (filter V). 

These  phenomenological  parameters  may  be  used  for  estimates  of  the 

physical  parameters.  For  this,  one  may  use  the  “simplified”  model  of  spherical 

components  without  effects  of  ellipticity,  reflection  and  limb  darkening  (Kopal 

1959,  Shulberg  1970,  Tsessevich  1971,  Malkov  et  al.  2007,  Andronov  and 

Tkachenko 2013). If using the phenomenological parameters mentioned above, the 

 
 
 
 
corresponding point at the “depth – depth“ diagram (Fig.1 in Malkov et al. 2007) 

lies  close  to  the  line  “R”  of  equal  radii,  but  slightly  outside  the  allowed  region. 

This is obviously explained because more correct is to use the “NAV” parameters 

(cid:1829)(cid:2874) and (cid:1829)(cid:2875) instead of the classical Min I-Max I and Min II-Max I. 

The sharp shape of the eclipses also argues for similar characteristics of the 

two stars. Assuming that the components are Main Sequence stars, it is possible to 

use  statistical  “Mass-Radius-Luminosity”  relations  (e.g.  Allen  1973,  Cox  1980) 

and to apply them for the analysis along with (cid:1829)(cid:2874) and (cid:1829)(cid:2875).  

In our case of two-color photometry, one  may check the solutions  for each 

color.  Andronov  et  al  (2015a)  discussed  the  procedure  in  detail.  Here  we  would 

like  to  note  that  the  results  are  self  consistent,  with  only  few  per  cent  of 

uncertainty, mainly due to different estimates of the statistical dependencies. Using 

the oversimplified form of the MS  mass-radius relation (cid:1844) =

.(cid:3014)
(cid:3019)
(cid:3014)

 (Faulkner 1971) 

and, combining with the third Kepler's  law, we obtain  for the  inclination (cid:1861) = 90o, 

(cid:1839)(cid:2869) = 0.745,   (cid:1839)(cid:2870) = 0.854, (cid:1839) = (cid:1839)(cid:2869) + (cid:1839)(cid:2870) = 1.599,
a=1.65.109m=2.37R


 and relative radii r1=R1/a=0.314 and  r2=R2/a=0.360.  

 the 

orbital 

separation 

Generally, these are minimal estimates of the radiuses and masses, as for the 
inclination  (cid:1861) ,  differing  from  90o,  we'll  get  larger  estimated  values.  In  the 
assumption  of  one  total  eclipse,  one  may  write  cos  i<|r2-r1|=0.046,  thus  87.4o≤i≤ 
90o,  0.999≤sin  i≤1,  so  for  VSX  1802  the  effects  of  inclination  onto  estimates  of 

radii  and  masses  are  negligible.  According  to  Cox  (2000),  the  spectral  classes  of 

the stars are G8 and K2 for the mass estimates mentioned above.
