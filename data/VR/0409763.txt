ABSTRACT

We present V R magniﬁcation ratios of QSO 0957+561, which are inferred
from the GLITP light curves of Q0957+561A and new frames taken with the
2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope about 14 months after the GLITP monitoring.
To extract the ﬂuxes of the two close components, two diﬀerent photometric tech-
niques are used: pho2comC and psfphot. From the two photometric approaches
and a reasonable range for the time delay in the system (415–430 days), we do not
obtain achromatic optical continuum ratios, but ratios depending on the wave-
length. Our ﬁnal global measurements ∆mAB(λV ) = 0.077
0.023 mag and
∆mAB(λR) = 0.022
0.013 mag (1σ intervals) are in agreement with the Oslo
group results (using the same telescope in the same seasons, but another photo-
metric task and only one time delay of about 416 days). These new measurements
are consistent with diﬀerential extinction in the lens galaxy, the Lyman limit sys-
tem, the damped Ly α system, or the host galaxy of the QSO. The possible values
for the diﬀerential extinction and the ratio of total to selective extinction in the
V band are reasonable. Moreover, crude probability arguments suggest that the
ray paths of the two components cross a similar dusty environment, including a
network of compact dust clouds and compact dust voids. As an alternative (in
fact, the usual interpretation of the old ratios), we also try to explain the new ra-
tios as caused by gravitational microlensing in the deﬂector. From magniﬁcation
maps for each of the gravitationally lensed images, using diﬀerent fractions of
the surface mass density represented by the microlenses, as well as diﬀerent sizes
and proﬁles of the V –band and R–band sources, several synthetic distributions of

[∆mAB(λV ),∆mAB(λR)] pairs are derived. In some gravitational scenarios, there
is an apparent disagreement between the observed pair of ratios and the simu-
lated distributions. However, several microlensing pictures work well. To decide
between either extinction, or microlensing, or a mixed scenario (extinction +
microlensing), new observational and interpretation eﬀorts are required.

Introduction

The ﬁrst lensed quasar QSO 0957+561 (Walsh, Carswell, & Weymann 1979) is an
important laboratory to study the evolution of multiwavelength magniﬁcation ratios in a
lens system and the nature of the involved physical phenomena. However, although a
lot of magniﬁcation ratios were measured during the last twenty years, there is no a fair
and complete picture accounting for them. The magniﬁcation ratio (in magnitudes) is de-
ﬁned as the diﬀerence between the magnitude of Q0957+561A and the time delay cor-
rected magnitude of Q0957+561B. At an observed wavelength λ and time t, the ratio is
∆mAB(λ, t) = mA(λ, t)
mB(λ, t + ∆tAB), where ∆tAB is the time delay between the two
components. Diﬀerent studies have stablished that the radio magniﬁcation ratio does not
depend on the time and it is close to
0.31 mag (e.g., Conner, Leh´ar & Burke 1992; Garrett
et al. 1994). Moreover, the optical emission-lines ratio agrees with the radio magniﬁcation
ratio: ∆mAB(radio)
0.31 mag (e.g., Schild & Smith 1991).

These radio/optical results suggest that the macrolens magniﬁcation ratio must be of

mag.

On the other hand, the measurements in several optical ﬁlters (mostly containing optical
continuum light) disagree with the macrolens ratio. The R–band magniﬁcation ratio has
been more or less constant for about 15 years, but relatively far from the expected ratio for
no extinction/microlensing (Pelt et al. 1998; Oscoz et al. 2002; Ovaldsen et al. 2003a):

telescopes in diﬀerent observatories. Another intriguing result was obtained from the Apache
Point Observatory (APO) data. Kundi´c et al. (1997) used the 3.5m telescope at the APO,
and estimated magniﬁcation ratios of ∆mAB(λg, 1995)
≈
0.21 mag. These last gr ratios were analyzed by Press & Rybicki (1998), who did not obtain
any fair conclusion. However we feel that the r-band ratio is strongly biased because of the
methodology to derive it. From the gr light curves, Kundi´c et al. (1997) simultaneously
ﬁtted the magniﬁcation ratios (magnitude oﬀsets) and the contaminations of the lens galaxy.

Nevertheless, as the contamination of the lens galaxy in a given optical band is basically a
noisy magnitud oﬀset, the Kundi´c et al.’s technique only works when the magniﬁcation ratio
is noticeably larger than the contamination. Thus, whereas the g–band ratio may be close
to the true ratio in that optical band, the r–band ratio could represent the sum of two
contributions: a part related to the true magniﬁcation ratio and an important contribution
due to the lens galaxy. We note that the intensive R–band data agree with this reasonable
hypothesis.

−

Once we solved the R

r paradox, it seems still necessary to do a detailed analysis
of the magniﬁcation ratios in the red and blue regions of the optical continuum, study the
possible evolution of the ratios, and try the interpretation of the results from diﬀerent per-
spectives (e.g., extinction and microlensing). In order to justify the optical continuum ratios,
gravitational microlensing scenarios are so far the favorite ones. Two facts determine this
choice. First, radio–signals and optical emission–lines reasonably come from regions much
larger than the optical continuum sources, so microlensing exclusively would change the ﬂux
from the optical continuum (compact) sources. Moreover, a dusty environment could lead
to emission–lines ratios diﬀerent to
0.31 mag. Second, there is ambiguity on the chro-
maticity/achromaticity and evolution/rest of the ratios (using the oldest data, some authors
claimed the existence of a drop in 1983: ∆mAB(λR, 1983)
0.3 mag, which would repre-
sent the recuperation of the macrolens magniﬁcation ratio and would be diﬃcult to interpret:
a void in a dust cloud crossing the A image, or an interface between two consecutive dust
clouds or microlensing events?). This ambiguity permits to assume achromaticity and rest,
which are fully consistent with sources moving across a roughly constant magniﬁcation pat-
tern (on the scale and path of the sources). However, Press & Rybicki (1998) remarked that
the excessive constancy of the optical ratios from 1980 through 1995 (and so, the constancy
of the magniﬁcation) is relatively discordant with a microlensing scenario.

In this paper (Section 2) we present new V R magniﬁcation ratios of QSO 0957+561.
The data correspond to the 2000/2001 seasons.
In Section 3, the results are compared
with the predictions of a dusty intervening system. In Section 4, we study the feasibility of
an interpretation based on a population of microlenses within the deﬂector (lens galaxy +
cluster). Finally, the main conclusions and future prospects are included in Section 5.

2. Optical continuum magniﬁcation ratios

We observed QSO 0957+561 from 2000 February 3 to 2000 March 31, as well as in
2001 April. All observations were made with the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT)
in the V and R bands. The main period (in 2000) corresponds to the Gravitational Lenses

– 4 –

International Time Project (GLITP) monitoring, which was already reduced, analyzed and
discussed (Ull´an et al. 2003). In 2001 April, we obtained frames at two nights. Unfortunately,
only the frames on April 10 are useful for photometric tasks. We used the Bessel V and R
passbands, with eﬀective wavelengths of λV = 0.536 µm and λR = 0.645 µm, respectively.
Therefore, as the source quasar is at redshift zs = 1.41, we deal with the rest-frame ultraviolet
continuum (0.222–0.268 µm).

From the GLITP brightness records of Q0957+561A and the about 14 months delayed
Q0957+561B ﬂuxes, one can ﬁnd the V –band and R–band magniﬁcation ratios. Thus, ﬁrst,
we take the Q0957+561A ﬂuxes in Figs. (6–7) of Ull´an et al. (2003). These ﬂuxes were
derived from two photometric approaches: pho2com and psfphot, which led to two datasets
consistent each other. Second, using the pho2com task, the subtraction of the lens galaxy in
the Q0957+561B region is not perfect, and some additional correction must be incorporated
(Serra-Ricart et al. 1999). Ull´an et al. presented GLITP correction laws that qualitatively
agree with contamination trends for the IAC–80 telescope/camera (operated in the Teide
Observatory by the Instituto de Astroﬁsica de Canarias), so we use the pho2com method
and the GLITP contamination laws to extract clean ﬂuxes of Q0957+561B on 2001 April
10 (at the time tB). The combined technique (pho2com + corr) is called pho2comC. Third,
we obtain the ﬂuxes of Q0957+561B at tB through the psfphot task. In this photometric
technique, the way to determine the brightnesses of the two quasar components and the
lens galaxy is from PSF ﬁtting. We use the code developed and described by McLeod et al.
(1998), which was kindly provided us. Several details on the psfphot approach were included
in section 2 of that paper. The V –band (blue ﬁlled circles) and R–band (red ﬁlled circles)
ratios are presented in Figure 1. While the top panel contains the results from pho2comC, the
bottom panel includes the psfphot results. The ∆mAB diﬀerences are computed in a simple
way: given an optical ﬁlter, a task and a time delay ∆tAB, we compare the Q0957+561A
∆tAB and the Q0957+561B ﬂux at tB. Only relatively
data in a 5–days bin centered on tB −
populated bins are taken into account, i.e., bins with 3 or more data. It is a clear matter
that the ∆mAB(λV , 2000) = ∆mAB(λV ) and ∆mAB(λR, 2000) = ∆mAB(λR) are not similar.
In other words, given a photometric approach and a time delay, the magniﬁcation ratios are
not achromatic, and it is apparent the existence of a correlation between the ratios and the
corresponding wavelengths, with the higher ratio for the smaller wavelength.

However, as we only have one frame in both ﬁlters (V and R) at tB, the V R ﬂuxes
of Q0957+561B are not so well–determined as the free–of–peaks–of–noise and binned ﬂuxes
of Q0957+561A. Due to this fact, there is a small discrepancy between the V R ratios from
the two photometries. Fortunately, Ovaldsen et al. (2003b) reported V R ﬂuxes of QSO
0957+561 through ﬁve nights (one in 2000 January and four in 2001 March) of intensive
monitoring at the NOT. The Oslo group used the same telescope in the same seasons,

– 5 –

although they reduced the frames from another method (diﬀerent to pho2comC or psfphot)
and only tested the V R magniﬁcation ratios for a delay of about 416 days. Their typical
values ∆mAB(λV ) = 0.065 mag (blue open circles in Fig. 1) and ∆mAB(λR) = 0.026 mag
(red open circles in Fig. 1) agree with our results, and roughly represent a gap larger than
the gap associated with psfphot, but smaller than the pho2comC gap. Once we conﬁrm
the absence of strongly biased results, as the V R estimates for a given photometry do not
seem to be very sensitive to the delay value, we introduce delay–averaged V R ratios.
In
this ﬁrst step, the eﬀective ratios are: ∆mAB(λV ) = 0.097
0.011 mag and ∆mAB(λR) =
0.012
0.007
±
mag, from pho2comC and psfphot, respectively. The eﬀective measurements are obtained
from the averages of the typical values and errors for the diﬀerent delays. In a second step,
taking into account the estimates from the two photometric techniques, we infer the ﬁnal
global measurements. These V R measurements are: ∆mAB(λV ) = 0.077
0.023 mag and
0.013 mag (1σ intervals). Each 1σ interval accounts for both the
∆mAB(λR) = 0.022
scatter between the typical values and the formal uncertainty of the photometric methods.
The two individual contributions are added in quadrature.

3. Dust system

We are going to discuss the feasibility of two physical scenarios, which are usually
introduced to explain optical ratios in disagreement with the expected macrolens ratio. The
relative extinction of Q0957+561A is our ﬁrst option. This relative extinction may be caused
by dust in an intervening system. What system?. As the Milky Way is a bad candidate (the
psfphot measurements and a hypothetical dust system at z = 0 lead to unphysical extinction
parameters), one can discard the diﬀerential extinction inside the Galaxy. However, in QSO
0957+561, we have four more candidates. Lens galaxies can generate diﬀerential extinction
between the components of lensed quasars (e.g., Falco et al. 1999, Motta et al. 2002). Thus,
the z = 0.36 lens galaxy is an obvious candidate.
It was discovered by Stockton (1980),
and it is a giant elliptical galaxy residing in a cluster of galaxies. The light related to the
A component and the light associated with the B component cross over two galaxy regions
20 h−1 kpc, where the Hubble constant is given by H = 100 h km
that are separated by
s−1 Mpc−1, Ω = 0.3, and Λ = 0.7. Besides the lens galaxy, there are two Ly absorption-line
systems at redshifts z = 1.1249 and z = 1.3911 (e.g., Michalitsianos et al. 1997). The object
closer to the observer (z = 1.1249) is a Lyman limit system. For this system, spectra of QSO
0957+561 showed that the absorption in component A is marginally greater compared with
component B. Therefore, assuming that more gas implies more dust, a relative extinction of
Q0957+561A could be produced at z = 1.1249. Michalitsianos et al. (1997) did a detailed

∼

– 6 –

study of the damped Ly α system at z = 1.3911. In this far object, there is a strong evidence
for diﬀerent H I column densities between the lensed components, with the line of sight to
image A intersecting a larger column density. The result NA(H I) > NB(H I) was also
claimed by Zuo et al. (1997), who suggested the possibility of a diﬀerential reddening by
dust grains in the damped Ly α absorber. At z = 1.3911, the ray paths of the lensed images

scheme by Smette et al. 1992, but using an Ω = 0.3 and Λ = 0.7 cosmology). Apart from
the lens galaxy and the Ly absorption–line systems, one can also consider the source’s host
galaxy at z = 1.41.

delay–averaged V R magniﬁcation ratios from pho2comC and psfphot, which are considered
as two extreme cases: a big gap of 0.085 mag (pho2comC) and a small gap of 0.025 mag
(psfphot). The Ovaldsen et al.’s measurement would correspond to an intermediate case of

The results are showed in Figure 2. The solid line represents the extinction parameters from
the pho2comC ratios, whereas the dashed line traces the parameters from the psfphot ratios.
In Fig. 2, the red points are the solutions for zdust = 0.36 (lens galaxy), the green points are
the solutions for zdust = 1.1249 (Lyman limit system), the blue points are associated with
zdust = 1.3911 (damped Ly α system), and the yellow points are associated with zdust = 1.41

derived. In the Galaxy, typical paths have a ratio of total to selective extinction RV ≈
3.1,
while paths through typical and non–typical extinction regions have values in the range 2–6.
The RV values in far galaxies can be even higher. For example, the z = 0.68 spiral lens
B0218+357 has RV ≈
7–12 (Falco et al. 1999; Mu˜noz et al. 2004). Therefore, the results
on RV seem reasonable. On the other hand, the range for diﬀerential extinction agrees with
typical values in lens systems, and as a general conclusion, the observations can be explained
by means of a dusty scenario.

−

– 7 –

How is the structure of the dust system?. The ray paths of the two components cross
either diﬀerent environments (i.e., B crosses an empty zone and A crosses a dusty zone) or
the same dusty environment. In the ﬁrst case, as the emission–lines sources do not experience
(important) diﬀerential extinction and the optical continuum compact sources suﬀer it, the
A zone would include a compact dust cloud in the trajectory of the A beam together with a
random distribution of similar clumps of dust. The distribution of clouds cannot signiﬁcantly
perturb the radiation from the emission–lines sources. If the projected (into the source plane)
cloud radius is Rcloud = 0.01 pc, i.e., similar to the expected radial size of the whole accretion
disk around a 108 M⊙ black hole, then the time of cloud crossing by the optical continuum
region (OCR) is of about 30 years (considering ROCR < Rcloud and an eﬀective transverse
velocity of 600 km s−1; e.g., Wambsganss et al. 2000). If we also consider the existence of N
dust clouds in front of the broad–line region (BLR) as well as a typical radius RBLR = 0.1
pc, the surface covering factor of the dust would be fdust/BLR = N(Rcloud/RBLR)2 = 10−2N.
As fdust/BLR should be much smaller than 1 (fdust/BLR << 1), a constraint on the surface
density of clouds can be derived in a simple way. It must be much smaller than 104/π clouds
pc−2, so the probability to see a cloud crossing phenomenon is equal to or less than 10%.
The situation is better in the second case, when the A and B zones are within the same
environment. While a homogeneous distribution of dust is not consistent with the optical
continuum ratios, an inhomogeneous distribution works well. We assume an environment
constituted by a network of compact dust clouds and compact empty regions (Rcloud = Rvoid
= 0.01 pc), with a cloud in the trajectory of the A beam and a void in the trajectory of
the other (B) beam.
In this picture, the optical continuum ratios would be anomalous,
but the emission–line ratios would be very close to the macrolens ratio, because two large
regions contain a very similar amount of dust. Moreover, both the probability of a cloud
crossing (component A) and the probability of a void crossing (component B) are of about
50%. Hence, the probability of a cloud(A)/void(B) crossing is crudely of 25%. For the farest
candidate (host galaxy), the common environment is a very reasonable approach, and for
the nearest candidate (lens galaxy), the common environment could be due to the presence
of an inhomogeneous dust lane with a length of

20 kpc.

≥

4. Microlensing

To explain the chromatic ratios, the gravitational microlensing of QSO 0957+561 is
our second option. While the emission-lines regions are not magniﬁed from gravitational
microlensing, the optical continuum compact sources could be aﬀected by this physical phe-
nomenon. Using the values for the normalized surface mass density (convergence) and the
shear, we produce 2–dimensional magniﬁcation maps with a ray shooting technique (Wamb-

– 8 –

sganss 1990, 1999). These values are: κA = 0.22, γA = 0.17, κB = 1.24, and γB = 0.9 (Pelt
et al. 1998). With respect to the fraction of the surface mass density represented by the
microlenses, we consider three cases: (a) all the mass is assumed to be in granular form
(compact objects), (b) 50% of the mass in granular form, and (c) the mass is dominated
by a smoothly distributed material, with only 25% of the mass in compact objects. All the
microlensing objects are assumed to have a similar mass M and are distributed randomly
over the lens plane. We obtain detailed results for M = 1M⊙, and comment the expected
results for smaller masses (M < 1M⊙). The eﬀect of the source is taken into account by
convolving a selected source intensity proﬁle with the magniﬁcation maps. We consider two
diﬀerent circularly–symmetric proﬁles: a p = 3/2 power–law (PL) proﬁle and a Gaussian
(GS) proﬁle. The PL proﬁle was introduced by Shalyapin (2001), and it is roughly consistent
with the standard accretion disk. The GS proﬁle is not so smooth as the PL one, and it
was used in almost all previous microlensing studies in QSO 0957+561. In our model we
assume that the V –band source has a characteristic length (intensity distribution) of RV =
1015 cm
3
(large source), and the source size ratio q = RV /RR is given by about 0.8 or 1/3. For the
λ4/3 (e.g., Shalyapin et al.
standard accretion disk model, one has the relationship R(λ)
2002), and consequently, the standard ratio q
0.8, which is close to the critical ratio (q
= 1). It is also assumed that the source, the deﬂector and the observer are embedded in a
standard ﬂat cosmology: H = 100 h km s−1 Mpc−1, h = 2/3, Ω = 0.3, Λ = 0.7.

In other recent analyses about QSO 0957+561 microlensing (Refsdal et al. 2000; Wamb-
sganss et al. 2000), the authors concentrated on the time evolution of ∆mAB in a given optical
band. Refsdal et al. (2000) used a GS source and found 90% conﬁdence level constraints
for the microlenses mass M and the source radius R: M = 2
×
1015 cm. On the other hand, Wambsganss et al. (2000) claimed that the microlenses mass
0.1 M⊙ for small GS sources (3σ limit). All these previous constraints are based
must be
on the hypothesis of a Gaussian source, and moreover, as the analyses were focused on the
time domain, some hypotheses about both the eﬀective transverse velocity and the random
microlens motion were needed. However, our approach is diﬀerent, because we wish to study
the spectral evolution of ∆mAB at a given emission time. In this paper, we discuss both
the GS and PL proﬁles and do not need to introduce a dynamical hypothesis. In fact, in
relation to multiepoch simulations, multiband simulations have the advantage of being free
from assumptions on the peculiar motions of the quasar and deﬂector, and the orbits of the
microlenses in the lens galaxy and cluster centre.

×

The key idea is that the V R magniﬁcation ratios are generated by two circular concentric
sources with diﬀerent size. The common center of the V –band and R–band sources is placed
at two arbitrary pixels of the two magniﬁcation patterns, and we look for the corresponding

– 9 –

[∆mAB(λV ),∆mAB(λR)] pair. For a given set of physical parameters, we can test a very large
number of pairs of pixels (104), and thus, obtain a distribution of pairs of magniﬁcation ratios.
In the [∆mAB(λV ),∆mAB(λR)] plane, for q = 1 (critical source size ratio), the simulated
distributions would lie exactly on the ∆mAB(λR) = ∆mAB(λV ) straight line (critical line).
However, when q
= 1, we must infer 2D distributions, including points at non-zero distances
(in magnitudes) from the critical line. The 2D distributions in the six panels of Fig. 3 have
been derived by using a deﬂector with only granular matter (M = 1M⊙) and GS sources. In
Fig. 3 (and also Fig.4), the results for the small, intermediate and large V –band sources are
depicted in the top, middle and bottom panels, respectively. The left panels correspond to
a standard q, and the right panels correspond to a non–standard q (q = 1/3). We also draw
the rectangle associated with the 1σ measurements. It is apparent that larger diﬀerences
between RV and RR imply wider distributions. In Fig. 3, we only see a very interesting
region of the whole plane, which includes the observed magniﬁcation ratios. The reader can
extrapolate the six behaviours in this region towards a larger region along and around the
critical line. In order to get a good resolution, instead of the whole 2D distributions, we
decided in favour of a smaller (but representative) region. What about the PL intensity
proﬁle?. In Fig. 4, we again consider all the mass in compact objects of M = 1M⊙, but PL
sources. The new distributions are diﬀerent to their partners in Fig. 3 (with similar values
of RV and RR). However, for obtaining quantitative conclusions, some additional analyses
are needful.

We make 12 histograms N(d) for the 12 scenarios where 100% of the mass is contained
in compact objects (M = 1M⊙). Each histogram represents the number of points at diﬀerent
distances d (in magnitudes) from the critical line. Given the [∆mAB(λV ),∆mAB(λR)] pair,
∆mAB(λR)]/√2, and the diﬀerence
the distance from the critical line, d = [∆mAB(λV )
∆mAB(λR), diﬀer only in a factor √2. Therefore, we
between ratios, D = ∆mAB(λV )
analyze histograms N(d), which are basically D distributions. The points above the critical
line have negative distances (d < 0), whereas the points below the critical line have positive
distances (d > 0). All the histograms are showed in Fig. 5: GS proﬁle and standard q (top
left panel), GS proﬁle and q = 1/3 (top right panel), PL proﬁle and standard q (bottom
left panel), and PL proﬁle and q = 1/3 (bottom right panel). We use blue lines for the
small V –band source, green lines for the intermediate V –band source, and red lines for the
large V –band source. The four arrows indicate the distances from the critical line to the
four vertexes of the 1σ rectangle in Figs. 3 and 4. If the true [∆mAB(λV ),∆mAB(λR)] pair
would be within the 1σ box, then the true distance would verify d
0.013 mag. Here, we
assume that the true pair is placed at d
0.013 mag, so probabilities P (d < 0.013 mag) are
computed. Some probability distributions (histograms) lead to very high values of P (d <
0.013 mag), and thus, we can rule out the corresponding scenarios. On the contrary, other

d relationships are relatively consistent with the constraint. The estimates of P (d <
90%, which suggest realistic
0.013 mag) appear in Table 1, and we see several values
physical parameters, or in other words, viable scenarios. In the GS proﬁle case, the feasible
pictures are related to either the large V –band source or an intermediate V –band source
together with a non–standard R–band companion. In the PL proﬁle case, from the P
90% criterion, all the scenarios seem to be plausible.

(right panel) components as well as the 10000 pairs of pixels (white marks) used to produce
Figs. 3, 4 and 5. For the B component, the granular mass density is high and the caustic
network almost takes up the whole map. The 104 highlighted pixels in each map are ran-
domly distributed, so the sampling is not biased. In Fig. 7, the chromatic microlensing is
apparent. The caustic maps in Fig. 6 are convolved with the largest Gaussian sources (RV =
RV ). In the three top panels of Fig. 7, we include the V –convolved

map for the A component (left), the R–convolved map for the A component (centre), and
the diﬀerence between the two convolutions (right). The results for the B component appear
in the three bottom panels of Fig. 7: V –convolution (left), R–convolution (centre), and
diﬀerence (right). It is clear that the convolutions with the V –band source are diﬀerent to
the convolutions with the R–band source. This fact gives rise to the appearance of chromatic
eﬀects, i.e., there are diﬀerence signals in the two right panels.

When all the mass is not contained in compact objects, i.e., a certain mass fraction
is smoothly distributed, we can repeat the above–mentioned procedure and obtain new
2D distributions, histograms, probabilities, etc. To avoid an ”excess of complementary
material” (ﬁgures), only the P (d < 0.013 mag) values are included in Table 1. Two diﬀerent
cases are analyzed in this paper: 50% of the mass in granular form (50% of the mass in
a smoothly distributed component), and 25% of the mass in compact objects (75% of the
mass is contained in a smoothly distributed material). As the percentage of mass in compact
objects decreases, it is more diﬃcult to ﬁnd scenarios in agreement with the observational
constraint. In fact, when the mass is dominated by a smoothly distributed material, almost
all the physical pictures are ruled out by the observations at the 90% level. Only two rare
scenarios (where the source sizes are in a relation 1:3) lead to P (d < 0.013 mag)
90%,
or equivalently, P (d
0.013 mag) > 10%. Although from a population of microlenses of
M = 1M⊙ we are able to test an important set of physical situations, we must also think
about the expected results from a population of microlenses of M < 1M⊙. In the extreme
(but still plausible) case of M = 10−2M⊙, the physical size of the magniﬁcation maps (the
maps are 2048 pixels a side which cover a physical size of 16 Einstein radii) reduces in a
factor 10 (just the factor that relates the Einstein radii for 1 M⊙ and 10−2M⊙). Now, the

We remark that the discussion is based on arrays of 2048 by 2048 pixels, which cover 16

to the availability of high performance computers.

5. Conclusions and future work

We present in this work a very robust estimation of the V R magniﬁcation ratios of
QSO 0957+561. The new measurements are based on observations (in 2000–2001) with
the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope, two diﬀerent photometric techniques, and a reasonable
interval for the time delay in the system. Our 1σ estimates ∆mAB(λV ) = 0.077
0.023
mag and ∆mAB(λR) = 0.022
0.013 mag are supported by the results in Ovaldsen et al.
(2003b). A ﬁrst conclusion is the relation ∆mAB(λV ) > ∆mAB(λR), which means that the
optical continuum magniﬁcation ratios are not achromatic, and moreover, the higher ratio
corresponds to the smaller wavelength.

To explain the measurements, two alternatives are explored: a dust system between the
quasar and the observer, or a population of microlenses in the deﬂector (the most popular
picture). We ﬁnd that the observed ratios are consistent with both alternatives, i.e., diﬀer-
ential extinction in a dust system and gravitational microlensing in the deﬂector. We cannot
rule out the existence of a dusty scenario constituted by a network of compact dust clouds
and compact empty regions, with a cloud in the line of sight to the Q0957+561A component
and a void in the trajectory of the Q0957+561B beam. The new estimates cover a narrow
spectral range (0.536–0.645 µm), and this fact plays a dramatic role in the discrimination of
possible physical scenarios. We think that future accurate measurements at a large collection
of wavelengths, with a good coverage of the 0.2–1 µm range, will decide on the feasibility
of a dust system in QSO 0957+561 and other things. For example, the GTC (a segmented
10.4 meter telescope to be installed in one of the best sites of the Northern Hemisphere:
the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain. First light
is planed for 2005) will have an instrument (OSIRIS) with very interesting preformances.
10−3 µm over the
OSIRIS will incorporate tunable ﬁlters with FWHM from 10−4 to 7
whole optical wavelength range, and thus, tunable imaging of the two quasar components
at two epochs (separated by the time delay) could lead to solve the current puzzle (dust or

microlenses?) and infer tight constraints on the physical parameters of the favoured alter-
0.36µm) may also be a decisive
native. Observations in the ultraviolet wavelength range (
tool. In particular, if the actual origin of the magniﬁcation ratio anomalies is a dust system
in the lens galaxy.

≤

If the 0.2175 µm extinction bump would be unambiguously detected (assuming dusty
scenarios in the 0.36–1.41 redshift interval, the rest-frame wavelength of the peak corresponds
to 0.30–0.52 µm in the observer frame), then the current extinction/microlensing degenera-
tion would be broken. In this last case (detection of extinction), one may try to derive a very
rich information: the diﬀerential extinction, the ratio of total to selective extinction in the
V band, the macrolens ratio, the redshift of the dust, and so on (e.g., Falco et al. 1999). On
the other hand, if the dusty scenarios would be ruled out from future observations at lots of
wavelengths, the multiwavelength ratios may be used to decide on the viable gravitational
microlensing scenarios. From a simple analysis, we show that several microlensing scenarios
are ruled out by the new observations at the 90% level (see Table 1 and Sect. 4), so future
detailed data could lead to important constraints. The future observational work will require
new ingredients in the microlensing scheme, e.g., new source intensity proﬁles (in particular,
the standard accretion disk proﬁle; Shalyapin et al. 2002), or a two mass population of
microlenses, describing the granular matter in the lens galaxy and the granular matter in
the cluster centre (e.g., Schechter, Wambsganss & Lewis 2004). Sophisticated source models
could be also included. The double ring structure suggested by Schild & Vakulik (2003) is
an obvious candidate. These authors have described the R–band source, but they did not
quote the chromatic behaviour of the ﬁve model parameters: the radius of the large ring,
the radial thickness of the large ring, the radius of the small ring, the thickness of the small
ring, and the brightness ratio of the two rings, which is a basic issue to simulate multiwave-
length magniﬁcation ratios. The extinction and microlensing hypotheses can be tested in
both the frequency and time domains, and several previous eﬀorts focused on the possible
microlensing variability (e.g., Refsdal et al. 2000; Wambsganss et al. 2000). Obviously, the
observations in the time domain (evolution of the magniﬁcation ratios) have a great interest.
However, when they are compared to microlensing simulations, the microlensing framework
must incorporate dynamical information, i.e., the confrontation between the observed evo-
lution and the microlensing scheme requires additional free parameters (which are needless
in multiwavelength studies). Finally, we note that the two alternative schemes (only dust
or only microlenses) might be biased models of the actual situation, and a mixed scenario
(extinction + microlensing) is also possible. Very recently, to explain spectrophotometric
observations of the lens system HE 0512
3329, Wucknitz et al. (2003) proposed this mixed
model.
