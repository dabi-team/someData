The interaction of laser cooled and trapped atoms with resonant light is limited by the linewidth
of the excited state of the atom. Another precise optical oscillator is an optical Fabry-P´erot cavity.
The combining of cold atoms with optical oscillators is emerging as an area with great potential for
precision measurements and the creation of versatile quantum optics systems. Here we show that
when driven atoms are in the collectively strongly coupled regime with the cavity, exhibiting vacuum
Rabi splitting (VRS), lasing is observed for the emitted light, red detuned from atomic transition.
This is demonstrated experimentally by the observation of a lasing threshold, polarisation purity,
mode purity, and line narrowing. The laser is created spontaneously by the atomic emission into
the cavity mode, which stimulates cavity emission, and is capable of operating continuously without
a seed laser. The gain mechanism is understood by theoretical modelling and illustrates why the
observed lasing is generic to the coupled system. This opens up a range of possibilities of using the
phenomenon for a variety of new measurements.

INTRODUCTION

While both cold atoms [1, 2]and cavity physics [3, 4]
are central to atomic physics, few experiments combine
an intra-cavity ensemble of cold atoms with a cavity [5–
10]. Cooled and trapped atoms are spatially localized,
natural linewidth limited and have high local densities,
which permits ease of spectral and spatial overlap with
cavity modes. When a large number of these atoms
are contained within the cavity mode volume, and the
atom-cavity system is brought into resonance, a collec-
tive strong coupling of atoms and light alters [3, 6, 9, 11–
15] the transmission properties of resonant probe light
through the cavity. This manifests in a change from a sin-
gle transmission peak per spatial electromagnetic (EM)
mode with a Lorentzian lineshape for an empty cavity, to
zero transmission of the probe on atomic resonance and
on scanning the probe light around the atomic transition,
symmetric red and blue detuned transmission peaks are
observed. The frequency diﬀerence between the trans-

atom-cavity coupling and Nc is the eﬀective number of
atoms coupled to the cavity mode.

In this article, we trap within the cavity mode, ﬂuo-
rescing and continuously driven MOT atoms. The atom
numbers in the present experiment are such that the col-
lective strong coupling regime of atom-cavity mode in-
teraction is accessible. We then pose the question, what
is the eﬀect of externally driven atoms on the coupled
atom-cavity system? The answer is surprisingly diﬀer-
ent from the non-driven system. On scanning the cavity
length, the system now emits light out of the cavity at
red and blue detuning of the cavity with respect to the
atomic resonance frequency. Since the magento-optical
trap (MOT) lasers are also the drive lasers and are red

detuned, the experimentally broken symmetry reﬂects in
the emission of light from the cavity atoms in a dramatic
manner, where the red detuned light emitted is a laser
and the blue detuned light is not a laser. Evidence of
lasing for the red detuning is obtained from the series of
experiments discussed below. The lasing here is not due
to population inversion in the gain medium but due to
multi-photon processes as is discussed in the theoretical
analysis. The lasing is seeded by spontaneous emission
from the driven atoms and not by an external seed/probe
laser. When this system is probed with an external cav-
ity probe laser, Fano-like resonances and line narrowing
is seen, which is much narrower than all the line widths
that are natural to the system, providing irrefutable ev-
idence of lasing by the driven atom-cavity system.

In recent times, understanding lasing with diﬀerent
gain mechanisms
[7, 16–24] has accelerated. For ex-
ample, one such process relies on quantum interference
between probability amplitudes in multilevel atoms and
does not require population inversion [16, 17]. Raman
processes between diﬀerent hyperﬁne levels and sub-
levels [7, 18, 19], levels involving external degrees of free-
dom [20, 21] have been exploited as gain mechanisms in-
cluding laser involving a single atom [22]. Much progress
in understanding the role of collective eﬀects on las-
ing [21, 23, 24] has been made. William et.al [7] showed
lasing using three diﬀerent gain mechanisms, Mollow
gain, Raman transition between Zeeman sublevels and
gain due to four-wave mixing, all of which were achieved
with the same gain medium. Raman transition between
Zeeman sublevels as a gain process was used by the same
group to demonstrate random laser without any cavity
and seed laser [25]. In the experiments here we demon-
strate that continuous lasing triggered by spontaneous
emission by the driven, non-inverted population of atoms
in the cavity mode is possible, robust and natural under
reasonable experimental conditions. The gain mechanism
for the lasing action is a result of multi-photon scatter-
ing [26, 27]. However, unlike previous works [7, 27], we

by a seed laser. Lezama et.al [28] have earlier seen las-

ing in an atomic beam experiment, but the atom-cavity
coupling was very small for any co-operative eﬀect to
manifest.

II. THE EXPERIMENT

√

The experimental schematic is as shown in the Fig. 1,
85Rb atoms are cooled and trapped in a Magnet-optical
trap (MOT). The centre of the MOT and centre of the
Fabry-P´erot cavity formed around it are made to over-
lap [9, 29]. The atomic ensemble is constantly illumi-
nated by the six MOT light beams. There is no light
incident on the cavity mirrors. The atom-cavity is in col-
lective strong coupling regime, i.e., g0
Nc > Γ, κ [3, 30].
Here g0/2π = 201 kHz is maximum single atom coupling
strength, Γ/2π = 6.06 MHz is atomic exited state de-
cay rate, 2κ/2π = 9.5 ± 0.1 MHz is cavity full width
at half maximum (FWHM) and Nc is an eﬀective num-
ber of atoms coupled to the cavity. Using an annular
piezoelectric transducer (PZT) attached to one cavity
mirror, the length of the cavity and hence its resonance
frequency (ωc) can be tuned. On scanning ωc around the
atomic transition, with frequency ωa (3-4(cid:48) transition of
D2 line [31], which is also the cooling transition for the
MOT), two peaks are observed in cavity emission. The
cavity emission is monitored using a Photo Multiplier
Tube (PMT) and a CCD camera. One peak is red de-
tuned side, and another peak is formed blue detuned to
the atomic transition at ωa as shown in Fig. 2(a). Both
these peaks show TEM00 spatial mode structure imaged
in the camera, i.e., the cavity output has Gaussian in-
tensity proﬁle. Other spatial modes also show similar
two peaked behaviour. The peak heights and frequencies

of both the peaks depend on Nc and power in the MOT
beams. The red detuned peak is only visible above a crit-
ical number of atoms (Nc ∼ 20 × 103) as seen Fig. 2(a)
and grows rapidly to dominate the blue detuned peak for
atom number Nc ∼ 33 × 103. In addition, from Fig. 2(a)
the peaks are seen to broaden as Nc increases.

√

Fig. 2(b) shows change in peak separation when Nc is
changed, as the cavity length is changed to scan across
the atomic resonance frequency. Blue dots in Fig. 2(b)
show corresponding vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) calcu-
lated for the same number of atoms and cavity parame-
ters, when the cavity is on atomic resonance, and external
weak probe light scans the atom-cavity system. From this
close agreement between the measured frequency split
and the VRS calculation we can see that the observed
split depends on g0
Nc, similar to VRS and hence we
conclude that the observed splitting and the atom-cavity
collective strong coupling are very closely related. How-
ever, this is the case only beyond a certain atom number
in the cavity mode. Below a critical value of Nc, the red-
detuned peak disappears while the blue detuned peak
persists, as seen in Fig. 2(c). Here a clear threshold is
seen in the measured heights of the red detuned peak,
while the blue detuned peak shows no threshold over the
measurement range. It is also evident from Fig. 2(b) and
Fig. 2(c) that the agreement with the VRS calculation
starts degrading at the larger values of Nc, which coin-
cides with the tendency towards saturation of the red
detuned peak height.

are (a) 22 mW/cm2 and (35 ± 1) × 103, (b) 30 mW/cm2 and (33 ± 1) × 103, (c) 36 mW/cm2 and (29 ± 1) × 103, (d) 45 mW/cm2
and (24 ± 1) × 103, (e) 60 mW/cm2 and (21 ± 1) × 103, (f) 75 mW/cm2 and (23 ± 1) × 103 respectively.

Fig. 3 shows how the peaks change when the power
of the MOT laser is increased. For very low power the
red detuned peak vanishes and when the power in MOT
laser is high the blue detuned peak vanishes. Increasing

the power increases total atom number but also increases
the spatial size of the atomic cloud in MOT. The increase
in size is attributed to an increase in temperature of the
MOT atoms [32–34]. The increase in size lowers Nc, and

(a)(b)(c)as fewer atoms overlap the cavity mode, the rate of ﬂuo-
rescence into the cavity decreases. Here, along with the
change in Nc, we can expect to see a competition between
the light emitted in the cavity mode by the atoms with
the stimulated emission of the excited atoms by the MOT
beams. This is because we go well above the saturation
intensity of the atoms, even at the detuned frequencies of

the MOT beams, for the case in Fig. 3. In this case, the
spontaneous emission that the blue detuned peak repre-
sents competes poorly against stimulated emission into
the MOT beams, compared with the red detuned peak.
This provides experimental evidence of crucial diﬀerences
between the blue and red detuned emission peaks ob-
served.

the height of the blue detuned peak, and red dots denote the height of the red detuned peak. Red dashed and blue dashed are

The smooth curves are obtained by ﬁtting cosine function multiplied by a linear function, (cid:0)a + b cos [ π

function is used to correct for the systematic eﬀect of atom number decrease during long measurements. (b) Cavity output

TEM10 mode. (xv) shows an instance of TEM00 mode. Here, for TEM00 mode Nc = (33 ± 1) × 103, it will be lower for higher
order modes. The power of MOT cooling laser is 36 mW/cm2 for all the cases.

III. SIGNATURES OF LASING

The threshold behaviour seen only in the red detuned
peak in Fig. 2(c) is suggestive of lasing in this driven
atomic system coupled to the cavity mode. Since dur-
ing lasing one mode experiences large gain compared to
others as stimulated emission ensures that the dominant
mode wins, so to check for lasing by the atom-cavity sys-
tem, we check for purity of the state of light that comes
out of the cavity. The ﬁrst check is for the polarisation
state of the cavity emitted light using a polariser (Thor-
labs LPNIRE100-B) with variable polarisation angle in
between the cavity mirror and the PMT. Fig. 4(a) shows
the change in peak height of both red and blue detuned
peaks as the polarization angle is changed. The polarisa-

tion of the red detuned peak is considerably purer than
that of the blue detuned peak. From the ﬁts to data, the
visibility for the red detuned peak is around 95 % and for
the blue detuned peak is around 43 %. The small change
in amplitude with polariser angle is due to the slight de-
crease in atom number as the measurement progressed.
Also from Fig. 4(b), it can be seen that the shape of the
blue detuned peak depends on polariser angle. The peak
and the wings of the blue detuned peak seem to be op-
positely polarised. This shows that the light out of the
cavity for the red peak is strongly polarised and indica-
tive of a single cavity mode present in the cavity. On the
other hand, the blue detuned peak has multiple modes in
coexistence, which is indicative of no mode competition
and therefore is detected as a mixture of several simulta-
neously existing modes. The consistent explanation for

(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)(v)(vi)(vi)(vii)(ix)(x)(xi)(xii)(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)(v)(vi)(vii)(viii)(ix)(x)(xi)(xii)(xiii)(xiv)(xiii)(xiv)(xv)TEM01TEM10(a)(b)(c)5

this is that the light out of the cavity for the red peak is
lasing. All the data mentioned above was for TEM00 spa-
tial mode as there are no nearby modes within the cavity
linewidth which will compete with this mode. This is ver-
iﬁed by imaging the spatial mode emitted by the cavity.
However, for higher spatial modes there is competition
between the cylindrical and rectangular modes which are
nearly degenerate as can be seen explicitly from Fig. 4(c).
Here again for the red detuned peak a single dominant
spatial mode is observed while the blue detuned cavity
emission peak shows multiple spatial modes of similar in-
tensities. The purity of polarisation and the spatial mode
is strong evidence for lasing in the case of the red detuned
peak. The sharp threshold for the red detuned peak and
the rapid increase in peak height as the atom number is
increased is characteristic of lasing behaviour arising due
to non-linear response with increase in an gain [35].

To measure the frequency at which the gain occurs, we
pass a probe beam through the cavity and monitor the
transmission. Fig. 5(a) shows the transmitted intensity

when the frequency of the probe beam is scanned while
keeping the cavity detuning ﬁxed on the red detuned peak
of the last graph in Fig. 2(a). The blue trace represents
the output with MOT atoms, and the red trace is the
output when there are no atoms in MOT (the magnetic
ﬁeld is switched oﬀ). As is evident from the diﬀerences in
the transmission in Fig. 5(a), the probe beam experiences
gain which is more than the total losses when interacting
with atoms inside the cavity. The shift between blue and
the red curve is due to lasing without any probe laser
as we make sure that the cavity detuning is ﬁxed on the
red peak of the last graph in Fig. 2(a). In addition to
gain, the blue trace also shows a Fano-like structure in-
dicating interference between two or multiple probability
amplitudes for emission [36] which suppresses the lasing
action. Fig. 5(b) shows line narrowing even in the ab-
sence of Fano structure slightly away from the red peak
of the last graph in Fig. 2(a). A similar experiment on
the blue detuned peak attenuates and shows a tendency
to broaden the transmitted light.

FIG. 5. Probe transmission spectra when atoms are present inside the cavity. For (a) and (b), the blue trace shows cavity
probe transmission when driven atoms are present in the cavity, and the broken red trace is probe transmission curve without
atoms.(a) This ﬁgure shows a gain and Fano-type structure in the presence of atoms. The cavity length is such that we are
near the top of the red detuned peak of the last graph in Fig. 2(a). We can see a gain in the probe at around 33 MHz. The blue
curve in the background is ﬁt to the sum of Lorentzian and inverted Lorentzian both of FWHM 4.5 MHz, and the red dashed
curve for the empty cavity is a Lorentzian with FWHM of 9.5 MHz. (b) This ﬁgure shows line narrowing and gain without the
Fano structure when the cavity is slightly red of the red detuned peak of the last graph in Fig. 2(a). A Lorentzian ﬁt to the
blue trace gives FWHM of 3.3 MHz and is shown as the blue curve. Here, for (a) and (b) Nc = (33 ± 1) × 103. (c) Without

is 36 mW/cm2.

IV. GAIN MECHANISM

The phenomenon of gain in probe beam when two-
level atoms are strongly driven by another drive laser is
well known. B. R. Mollow was ﬁrst to predict such gain
mechanism [37] using semi-classical arguments and phe-

nomenologically including atomic decay rates. Haroche
et.al [38] also did similar calculations during the same
year. This was later observed in an experiment with
sodium beam by Wu et.al [27]. Grynberg et.al [26] later
calculated the cross-section for such gain using micro-
scopic perturbation theory. They showed that in the

-60-40-2002005101520(cid:1)pa(MHz)V(mV)(a)(c)(e)(d)(f)(b)presence of a strong laser the atomic states get dressed,
and the gain arises because of multi-photon processes be-
tween the dressed states. In the case where the driving
laser is red detuned, this type of gain occurs only when
the frequency of probe is to the red side of the drive laser
frequency. For blue detuned peak such multi-photon pro-
cesses lead to loss due to absorption. The mechanism for
the gain here is similar to the work discussed above, with
the additional consideration that the cavity-atom collec-
tive strong coupling regime introduces certain diﬀerences
discussed below.

In the regime deﬁned by collective strong coupling,
weak probe transmission through the cavity is split
into two peaks when atoms are present in the cav-
ity. This eﬀect is called VRS and is a well-known phe-
nomenon [3, 6, 30]. Fig. 5(c) is a measurement of such
a split for which the MOT lasers were switched oﬀ, and
all the atoms were in the ground state [9]. Here, if the
cavity resonance frequency is matched with the atomic
frequency we see a symmetric splitting on the red and
the blue side of the atomic resonance. However, if the
cavity resonance is blue (red) detuned with respect to
the atomic frequency the blue (red) detuned VRS peak
is bigger than red (blue) detuned one [30] and blue (red)
peak shifts away (towards) from atomic frequency. How-
ever, when the drive laser with a frequency diﬀerent from
atomic transition is switched on, symmetry is broken be-
cause of unequal gain and loss. Fig. 5(d,e,f) shows such
a scenario. For Fig. 5(d), when the MOT drive lasers are
present, the frequency spectrum remains unchanged, but
the heights are completely diﬀerent, indicating an un-
equal total loss. The drive (MOT cooling laser) is to the
red side of atomic frequency. For Fig. 5(e) even though
the cavity resonance is set to the blue of the atomic reso-
nance, the red detuned peak is dominant. In the absence
of drive laser, the height of blue detuned peak would have
increased, and the height red detuned peak would have
diminished. However, due to Mollow gain in the the red
detuned probe and Mollow loss in the blue detuned probe
in the presence of the red detuned drive we see the op-
posite in Fig. 5(e) with respect to what is expected in
the case when the atoms are not optically driven. Equal
height for the two peaks is obtained when the cavity
resonance is 8MHz detuned towards blue of atomic fre-
quency as shown in Fig. 5(f). In addition to this there
also seems to be gain around -13 MHz which is the drive
frequency. This is because of coherent energy exchange
between drive and cavity. The observations mentioned
above are explained using a semi-classical theory in the
discussion section.

In addition to gain in the probe, we also observe lasing
without any seeding (no probe light). This is because of
the coupling of light into the cavity by the ﬂuorescing
atoms. B. R. Mollow was ﬁrst to calculate the ﬂuores-
cence spectrum of a two-level atom driven by a strong
monochromatic laser [39]. Such a spectrum can be com-
puted from ﬂuctuations of atomic coherence [40] and is
shown in the Fig. 7. There is some light at ∼ 30 MHz

red of the atomic transition. This resonance ﬂuorescence
provides the ﬁrst photon which is ampliﬁed by the driven
atoms.

V. DISCUSSION

To explain and interpret why the gain and lasing in the
red-detuned peak from the driven-atom, cavity coupled
system occurs we discuss the results of a model devel-
oped to understand the system. The model contains all
the essential elements required to understand the lasing
observed. We consider 2-level atoms coupled to one of
the modes of a Fabry-P´erot cavity, which is probed by a
monochromatic laser of frequency ωp and the atoms are
driven by a single drive laser with frequency ωd. The
probe and drive light ﬁelds are assumed to be classical.
The average photon number in the cavity is calculated
using a semi-classical theory of atom-light interaction.
Fig. 6 shows cavity transmission spectrum as a function
of the frequency of probe laser using Eqn. A.16. From
Fig. 6 it is evident that for red detuning the probe laser
experiences gain and for blue detuning experiences loss.
This is completely consistent with the experimental ob-
servations in Fig. 5. When the gain of probe laser from
atoms exceed the loss from the atoms-cavity system, we
see lasing as shown in Fig. 6(b) providing an explana-
tion for the lasing of the red-detuned peak.
In addi-
tion, the parameters in our calculations are such that
4|Ω|4 < |∆da|3Γ and 4|Ω|2 < |∆da|2, where 2Ω is Rabi
frequency of the drive laser, ∆da is detuning of drive laser
from the atomic transition and Γ is decay rate of the
atomic excited state due to spontaneous emission. This
is opposite to the conditions necessary for gain in probe
beam according to [26] and [37] respectively, where the
system was required to be driven hard. However, here
the presence of cavity enhances the interaction, and we
see gain even without the very demanding requirements
on parameters in the earlier experiments. On changing
the detuning of the cavity with respect to the atomic
transition, the collective eigenstate (VRS) also shifts in
frequency. When the cavity is blue detuned with respect
to the atomic transition, the red VRS peak shifts towards
the atomic transition and the blue peak shifts away from
the atomic transition. This makes it possible for the red
VRS peak to be in resonance with the MOT cooling laser
which is 13 MHz red detuned from the atomic transition
when the detuned cavity resonance is to the blue side.
As can be inferred from Fig. 7 the atomic ﬂuorescence
is dominant at MOT/drive laser frequency. Hence, the
combined system of atoms and cavity becomes resonant
for most of the ﬂuorescent light, when the cavity is blue
detuned with respect to the atomic transition. This ex-
plains the observation of the blue peak in the experiment
as shown in the Figs. 2(a), 3 and 4(b). This blue peak
is unpolarised as the ﬂuorescence can be of any polarisa-
tion.

VI. CONCLUSION

7

In conclusion, when a MOT of actively driven atoms
is collectively strongly coupled to a Fabry-P´erot cavity,
lasing is seen in the red detuned emitted light from the
atom-cavity system. The lasing for a stabilized cavity
and MOT atom number is continuous in nature. This
driving ﬁeld is the same as the MOT light which cools and
traps the atoms and results in continuous operation of the
laser from the coupled atom-cavity system. The lasing is
seen for the red detuned peak because symmetry is bro-
ken in favour of the red detuned peak due to the MOT
light, which also conﬁnes the atoms eﬀectively and cou-
ples it to the cavity mode. In principle the lasing could
be achieved on the blue detuned peak if the driving fre-
quency and the trap mechanism were not connected and
the driving light was blue detuned with respect to the
atomic transition. The observed phenomena are there-
fore generic to the driven atom-cavity system and have
potential to be of interest for basic studies and for appli-
cations. To analyse the basic processes of this phenomena
a semiclassical theory of light-matter interaction is pre-
sented in the discussion section and appendix, where the
role of Mollow gain and dispersion due to the collective
strong coupling of atoms to the cavity and the change in
the dynamics of the system is explained. Here, we took
the decay of the atomic excited state phenomenologically
similar to B. R. Mollow [37]. Theoretically, it would be
interesting to know how the laser properties change if
a full quantum and multimode description including the
vacuum modes [26] is used. The vacuum modes and the
drive ﬁeld can be then integrated out similar to the ap-
proach of open quantum optics [17] giving an eﬀective
non-linear interaction between the photons in the cavity
and the atoms. Future work can be taken up to observe
the properties of this type of non-linear laser, such as
photon statistics, phase diﬀusion and squeezing, as pre-
dicted by single mode theories of Zakrzewski et.al [41–43]
and Agarwal [44, 45]

FIG. 6. Probe transmission through the cavity as a function
of detuning from the atomic transition. Blue is empty cavity
transmission, the dotted brown curve is the VRS and red
dashed curve shows probe transmission when atoms are driven
by classical light. The two graphs are for diﬀerent detuning
of the cavity from atomic transition, (a) ∆ca = 0 and (b)
∆ca = −15 MHz. Other parameters are strength of drive
ﬁeld, Ω/(2π) = 6 MHz, strength of probe ﬁeld η/(2π) = 4.75
MHz, atom-cavity collective strong coupling, gt/(2π) = 30
MHz, Γ/(2π) = 6 MHz, cavity FWHM, 2κ/(2π) = 9.5 MHz,
and ∆pa = −13 MHz. α is ﬁeld amplitude inside the cavity.
The photon number is equal to |α|2.

and the experiment, the total intensity of all the MOT
beams and dipole moment for isotropic beam case gives
Ω/(2π) ≈ 6 MHz as an estimate. However, theoreti-
cal treatment is for single drive beam whereas there are
six beams, all with diﬀerent polarisation and non-zero
relative phase diﬀerence between them. The calculation
therefore is a lower estimate of the light-atom interaction,
since sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms will try to localise
atoms towards intensity maxima formed by the six MOT
beams increasing eﬀective value of Ω [34]. In addition,
for the analysis we have assumed the cavity ﬁeld to be
very weak, such that the atomic coherence, ρ is only ﬁrst
order in cavity ﬁeld, α. There is a possibility of gain to
be higher order in α which has not been considered here.
Hence exact quantitative comparison is not possible with
the present model, but qualitatively we do not expect the
physics behind the observations to change.

logically for cavity ﬁeld and atoms respectively. This approach is similar to the one taken by B. R. Mollow [37]. For
the calculation here, the cavity ﬁeld is assumed to be classical and is denoted by a coherent state |α(cid:105). Using the

As multiple frequencies are involved, we transform the time-dependent equations (A.2) into Fourier space. For

To understand the physics we discuss the various interactions sequentially. First, we neglect the classical driving
of the atoms, i.e. Ω = 0 and assume that the cavity ﬁeld (probe laser) is so weak that the atoms remain mostly in
ground state, i.e ˜ρe,j(ω) = ˜ρ∗

e,j(ω) ≈ 0. For such a case the cavity ﬁeld is,

˜α(ωd) =

j is total g for all the atoms and is equal to g0

gt =
Nc, where g0 is the single atom-cavity mode coupling
and Nc is an average number of atoms coupled to the cavity and can be calculated using an overlap of the cavity
mode and the atomic density distribution. ∆pc = ωp − ωc and ∆pa = ωp − ωa are detunings of the cavity probe
laser from the cavity and the atomic frequencies respectively. Eqn. (A.4) gives the usual splitting in the cavity peak
(VRS/normal mode splitting). The splitting between two peaks is equal to 2gt = 2g0

Nc.

Now, in the absence of a cavity all the atoms behave in same way. This is because all are driven equally by the

classical drive ﬁeld. The atomic variables in this case are,

˜ρ(ωd) =

−2iΩ(2i∆da + Γ)
Γ2 + 4∆2
da + 8|Ω|2

and ˜ρe(0) =

4|Ω|2

Γ2 + 4∆2

da + 8|Ω|2

(A.5)

∆da = ωd − ωa is detuning of drive laser from the atomic transition. The j subscript is removed as the atom-ﬁeld
interaction strength is same for all the atoms. The atomic coherence oscillates only at frequency ωd and all other
frequency components are zero.

b. Perturbative calculation

For our experiment, Ω2 (cid:29) g2

0|α|2 and hence the eﬀect of the cavity on the atoms is very small and adds only small
perturbations to values in (A.5). The perturbed atomic variables can be written as, ˜ρj(ω) = ˜ρ(ωd)δ(ω − ωd) + ˜(cid:15)j(ω),
˜ρe,j(ω) = ˜ρe(0)δ(ω) + ˜(cid:15)e,j(ω)and ˜ρ∗
e,j(ω). Here, (cid:15) is perturbation to density matrix elements of
atoms due to interaction with the cavity. Keeping only the unperturbed part in the convolution functions gives a set
of linear equations,

(A.7)

This requires ωp = ωd as seen in eqn (A.7) and results in an elastic exchange of energy from drive ﬁeld to cavity ﬁeld
via atoms and the cavity will gain photons even if it is not driven by an external ﬁeld.

For other frequencies the perturbation term ˜(cid:15)j(ω) is important, hence we proceed to derive it using Eqn (A.6).

Eqn (A.6b) can be rewritten as,

(cid:27)

+ i∆a(ω)

−

˜ρ(ωd) − iΩ {2˜ρe(0) − 1}

δ(ω − ωd)

(A.8)

The right-hand side of above equation is zero for all ω because the term ˜ρ(ωd) was derived by putting the linear
equation in right-hand side bracket with ω = ωd to zero in the absence of a cavity as can be inferred from Eqn (A.3)
by putting the cavity ﬁeld terms to zero. This gives,

e,j(ωd − ω)(cid:9) = 0

(A.9)

Using (A.9) and ˜(cid:15)∗

e,j(ωd − ω) ≈ 0 gives ﬁrst order term for ˜(cid:15)j(ω),

˜(cid:15)j(ωp) = −igj

˜α(ωp) {−2˜ρe(0) + 1}
2 − i∆pa

(cid:8) Γ

(cid:9)

= −igj ˜α(ωp)C1(ωp)

(A.10)

This is similar to the value of ˜ρ(ω) used to calculate Eqn (A.4) but with an extra factor of {−2˜ρe(0) + 1}. This
factor comes because of change in population diﬀerence between excited and ground state and eﬀectively reduces the
coupling as the cavity ﬁeld sees fewer atoms in the ground state.

Now for excited state population if we do not neglect the term, ˜(cid:15)∗

e,j(ωd − ω),

(iωd − iω + Γ)[˜ρe(0)δ(ωd − ω) + ˜(cid:15)∗

e,j(ωd − ω)]

j (2ωd − ω)(cid:9)

After rearranging we get,
(iωd − iω + Γ)˜(cid:15)∗
= (cid:2)−(iωd − iω + Γ)˜ρe(0) + i (cid:8)Ω∗ ˜ρj(ωd) − Ω˜ρ∗

Again the right hand side is zero for all ω. The complete set of equations to calculate ˜(cid:15)j(ωp) at the cavity probe

j (ω)(cid:9) = 0

(A.13c)

(A.13d)

If the cavity is only driven at one frequency, ωp, α(2ωp − ω) = 0 in above equations. From (A.13) it can be seen
that in addition to oscillating at the frequency ωp the atomic coherence also oscillates at frequencies ωp ± ∆pd, where
∆pd = ωp − ωd. This was an assumption made by B. R. Mollow in his article [37] for solving free space scenario of
the same problem as ours. We arrive at it using Fourier transforms. Hence, for non-zero ˜(cid:15)∗

e,j(ωd − ω) we get,

˜(cid:15)j(ωp) = −igj ˜α(ωp)[C1(ωp) + C2(ωp)]

(A.14)

Where C1(ωp) is same as in (A.10) and the value of C2(ωp) is,

C2(ωp) =

Nc = 22 × 103, Γ/(2π) = 6.06 and MOT laser linewidth 1 MHz. Most of the light emitted is at MOT laser/drive frequency.
y-axis shows the rate of photon emission into the cavity at that particular wavelength. This rate is upper bound on the actual
rate because in the calculation of the rate we assume that all the atoms are at the centre of the cavity and hence all the light
emitted by the atoms which fall on the cavity mirrors come back to the centre and form the cavity mode. Also, the emission
from atoms is assumed to be isotropic. Hence the rate is ζ× total rate of photon emission, where ζ = 0.009 depends on the
solid angle subtended by the mirrors at the centre of the cavity. The red sideband and blue sideband have centre frequencies
−30.6 MHz ≈ (∆pa − (cid:112)4Ω2 + ∆2

pa)/(2π) MHz and 4.6 MHz ≈ (∆pa + (cid:112)4Ω2 + ∆2

pa)/(2π) respectively.
