Abstract Highly–resolution optical
the IR–source
IRAS 01005+7910 are used to determine the spectral type of its central star, B1.5 ± 0.3, iden-
tify the spectral features, and analyze their proﬁle and radial velocity variations. The systemic
velocity Vsys = −50.5 km s−1 is determined from the positions of the symmetric and stable proﬁles
of the forbidden [N I], [N II], [O I], [S II], and [Fe II] emission lines. The presence of the [N II] and
[S II] forbidden emissions indicates the onset of the ionization of the circumstellar envelope and
the fact that the star is very close to undergoing the planetary nebula stage. The broad range of
heliocentric radial velocity Vr estimates based on the core lines, which amounts to about 34 km s−1,
is partly due to the deformations of the proﬁles caused by variable emissions. The variations of the
Vr in the line wings are smaller, about 23 km s−1, and may be due to pulsations and/or hidden bi-
narity of the star. The deformations of the proﬁles of complex absorption–emission lines may result
from variations of their absorption components caused by the variations of the geometry and kine-
matics in the wind base. The Hα lines exhibit P Cyg III type wind proﬁles. Deviations of the wind
from spherical symmetry are shown to be small. The relatively low wind velocity (27–74 km s−1
from diﬀerent observations) and the strong intensity of the red emission (it exceeds the continuum
level by up to a factor of seven) are typical for hypergiants rather than the classical supergiants.
IRAS 01005 is an example of spectral mimicry of a low mass post-AGB star masquerading as a
massive hypergiant.

1. Introduction

The IR–source IRAS 01005+7910 (hereafter referred to as IRAS 01005) is located high above the
Galactic plane at a latitude of b = 16.◦6. Its optical counterpart is a peculiar B–type supergiant,
B = 11.m5, V = 11.m2. The position of the source in the IRAS–color diagram is consistent with it under-
going the stage of a protoplanetary nebula (PPN). According to the chronological sequence of Lewis [1],
the absence of OH and CO emissions [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] indicates that the object is close to the planetary
nebula stage (PN). Klochkova et al. [7] obtained essential results for the central star of IRAS 01005.
The above authors determined the fundamental parameters of the supergiant (Teﬀ = 21500 K, surface
gravity log g = 3.0, metallicity [Fe/H] =−0.31, and the abundances of a number of chemical elements)
and conﬁrmed its post–AGB status. Another important result of the above study is the discovery of
carbon overabundance (C/O > 1) in the atmosphere of the central star.

The IR spectrum of the circumstellar envelope of IRAS 01005 exhibits spectral features of the
carbon-containing fullerene molecule (C60) [8, 9]. IRAS 01005 is the hottest post–AGB star among
those whose spectra exhibit the so far unidentiﬁed features at 3.3 and 3.4 µm [10]. The high Galactic
latitude of IRAS 01005 combined with its low metallicity indicates that the star belongs to the old
population of the Galaxy.

Klochkova et al.: Spectral variability of the IR-source IRAS 01005+7910

Several teams studied the photometric variability of IRAS 01005. Hrivnak et al. [11] noted variations
of the object on a time scale of less than several days which is too short for PPNe. Arkhipova et
al. [12] performed long-term U BV photometric monitoring of several hot PPNe including IRAS 01005
and found these objects to exhibit rapid irregular light variations. Based on these observations of the
low-amplitude PPN light variations, Arkhipova et al. [12] concluded that the parameters of the stellar
winds of these stars show variations and/or micropulsations with characteristic periods of several
hours.

The optical spectrum of IRAS 01005 has so far not been studied in suﬃcient detail. Based on low–
resolution observations, Hu [13] determined its spectral type to be Sp = B2 Ie and pointed out the
P Cyg proﬁle of the Hα line in the spectrum of IRAS 01005. He found no diﬀerences between the
spectra of the star taken ten years apart. However, Klochkova et al. [7] identiﬁed spectral features
in the spectra taken with echelle spectrographs of the 6–m telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory and found variations in the spectrum of the central star. The spectrum contains C II,
O II, N II, Al III, and Si III absorption lines, the Mg II λ 4481 ˚A line, and emission features identiﬁed
with Si II and the forbidden [Fe II] lines. The proﬁles of the hydrogen Balmer lines, the resonance
Na I doublet, the He I and Fe III lines contain both the emission and absorption components. The
optical spectrum was found to show substantial variations: the neutral helium lines vary from direct
to inverse P Cyg proﬁle on time scales from several days to several months. The lines of the Na I
resonance doublet contain ﬁve absorption components with the velocities of −11, −28, −52, −65,
and −73 km s−1, and the absorption proﬁle of the λ 5890 line is superimposed onto the high-velocity
emission component whose width coincides with that of the emission components of the hydrogen
lines. The observed variability of the spectrum provides a stimulus for further investigation of the
optical component of the IR source IRAS 01005.

In this paper we report the results of long-term monitoring of IRAS 01005 carried out with the aim
to study the variability of the optical spectrum. Note that unlike our previous study [7], here we use
only the high-resolution spectroscopic data. Section 2 brieﬂy describes the technique of observations
and data reduction and Section 3 presents the main results.

2. Observational data and their reduction

In this study we use twenty three high-resolution spectra (R =60 000) taken with the NES echelle
spectrograph [14, 15] of the 6–m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory during the period
from 2002 to 2013. It is important for spectral variability studies to use only the spectra taken with the
same spectrograph, albeit in diﬀerent wavelength intervals. Unfortunately, the spectra also diﬀer by
their exposure levels (signal-to-noise ratios S/N ). The dates, wavelength intervals, and maximum S/N
ratios are listed in the ﬁrst, second, and third columns of Table 1 respectively. To reduce the spectra,
we used the DECH program [16], which, in particular, can smooth r(λ) curves without appreciable
loss of resolution and measure radial velocities from paricular features of complex lines, which are
typical of our spectra, by superimposing the direct and mirrored images of their proﬁles.

All the radial velocities mentioned in this paper are heliocentric. The laboratory wavelengths used
to determine these velocities are listed in Table 2. Most of them are adopted from the NIST database1
and were validated by the spectra of the stars 10 Lac (O9 V) and ι Her (B3 III) with narrow lines
taken with the same spectrograph as the one used to observe IRAS 01005. In a number of cases (He I
triplets, C II and Mg II doublets, etc.) we use the eﬀective wavelengths. We indicate the number of the
multiplet in parentheses both in the text and in Table 2.

If telluric lines were present in the spectrum we used these to control and correct the inferred radial
velocities. We additionally controlled the stability of the radial velocity system by interstellar lines,
mostly those of Na I (1). We took into account the distortions due to the blending of these lines by
telluric H2O absorptions and Na I emissions, and, in the case of the D2 line, also by the C II (5) triplet.
All these distortions vary in time. Figure 1 illustrates their presence in the spectrum of November 13,
2005 and the complex structure of the D2 Na I (1) 5890 ˚A line proﬁle. The heliocentric radial velocities

−10.2 km s−1. The velocities of the two outermost (the deepest) components are listed in Table 1
(column 4). Judging by these velocities, the systematic errors of the radial velocities listed in other
columns of Table 1 do not exceed 1 km s−1.

3. Main results

3.1. Line-proﬁle and radial velocity variations

Klochkova et al. [7] showed that the proﬁles of most of the lines vary both in time and within the
same spectrum, from line to line. The proﬁles and their presumable formation regions can, to a ﬁrst
approximation, be subdivided into three types:

• narrow emissions—the tenuous extended envelope;

• emission-absorption proﬁles—the transition region from the photosphere to the envelope and, in
particular, stellar wind;

• absorptions—the photosphere.

The accuracy of single-line velocity measurements is determined by the noise (S/N ) and the gradient
of residual intensity in the line proﬁle (∆r/∆λ). As is evident from the example shown in Fig. 2, the
proﬁles in the spectrum of IRAS 01005 vary with time and from line to line. The accuracy of velocities
based on individual-line measurements can be estimated from the scatter of the corresponding symbols
in Fig. 3, which shows the Vr(r) dependences in the spectrum taken on May 29, 2013. The average
velocity errors for this spectrum, which has the S/N ratio typical of our data and the broadest
wavelength coverage, are equal to 0.5 km s−1, about 1 km s−1, and about 3 km s−1 for the forbidden
emissions, the absorption cores, and the weak emission components of Fe III lines respectively.

The least complex (symmetric) and stable proﬁles among the narrow emissions are those of the
[N I], [N II], [O I], [S II], and [Fe II] forbidden lines. The presence of forbidden [N II] and [S II] emissions
is indicative of the onset of the ionization of the circumstellar envelope and of the closely imminent
planetary nebula stage. The average radial velocities (measured on diﬀerent dates from diﬀerent sets
of these lines) are listed in column 5 of Table 1. Temporal variations of the velocities of forbidden
lines are close to those of interstellar absorption features, i.e., to the measurement errors. The velocity
appears to have remained constant during our observations. Averaging over the entire dataset yields
a value of −50.5 ± 0.2 km s−1. In Fig. 4 we compare the proﬁle of one of the stellar lines, [N I] 5198 ˚A,

Figure 3. Dependence of the radial velocity Vr on residual intensity r for the lines in the spectrum
of IRAS 01005 taken on May 29, 2013. Each symbol corresponds to an individual line. The ﬁlled
circles correspond to the forbidden emissions (r > 1.0, velocities measured by the peaks) and He I
and ion absorptions (r < 1.0, velocities measured by the cores), and the open circles—to the emission
(Vr < −60 km s−1) and absorption (Vr > −40 km s−1) components of Fe III line proﬁles.

with that of the [O I] 5577 ˚A telluric emission: the former is appreciably broader and has a half-width
of about 10 km s−1.

Unlike the radial velocities, the intensities of the forbidden lines exhibit small variations (with a
maximum amplitude of residual intensities equal to 5–6%). The reality of these variations is supported
by the fact that they occur synchronously in diﬀerent lines, by their absence over a two–day period,
and the fact that relative intensity variations of the lines in the [N I] 5198, 5200 ˚A, [Fe II] 4814, 5158 ˚A
and other doublets, which are limited only by observational errors, are substantially smaller 2–3%.
The part of the spectrum of IRAS 01005 available to us contains several weak O I emissions. Note
that the very strong OI (1) 7773 ˚A triplet is observed in absorption [7]. Its intensity might suggest
that weaker lines — members of multiplets (9) (6454–56 ˚A˚A) and (10) (6156–58 ˚A˚A) — should also
have the form of absorptions with the depths of R≈ 0.02, however, they cannot be distinguished from
noise in our spectra and are possibly ﬁlled with emissions. Pure emissions belong to the multiplets
(5) 4368 ˚A, (23) 5958 ˚A and (22) 6046 ˚A, and their mean residual intensities are equal to 1.04, 1.05, and
1.11 respectively. We show the proﬁle of the latter line in Fig. 4. The width and mean radial velocity
(−50.8 ± 1 km s−1) of the O I emission are close to the corresponding parameters of the forbidden
lines. The fact that forbidden lines and O I emissions form in the slowly expanding stellar envelope
suggests that the latter should also be responsible for the formation of narrow emission components
of the complex proﬁles of the ﬁrst members of the Balmer series. During our observations the wind
components of these features showed appreciable intensity variations, but maintained a P Cyg III type
proﬁle according to Beals with the red emission peak much higher than the blue one. Figure 5 shows
examples of the top parts of complex Hα proﬁles and the last column of Table 1 lists the radial velocities
of the absorption and emission extrema of their wind components based on our entire observed data.

Visual inspection shows that variations of the envelope ﬂux are more pronounced in hydrogen lines
than in forbidden O I emissions. Quantitative estimates are hindered by the blending of envelope and
wind emissions, however, they can be performed by comparing all the available Hα proﬁles. The range
of peak intensities of narrow components amounts to about 20% if the intensity variations at the
corresponding wavelengths in the wind components are taken into account. Figure 5 shows the upper
parts of the Hα proﬁles with relatively strong (August 21, 2013) and weak (November 22–25, 2002)

envelope components. As is evident from these proﬁles, the strongest (and hence least deformed by
blending) narrow Hα emissions are more or less as wide as the forbidden emissions and are minimally
shifted relative to them. As the component weakens, its peak shifts redward with its radial velocity
changing from −50 km s−1 on August 21, 2013 to −43 km s−1 on November 22–25, 2002.

The Si II lines also appear to form, at least partially, in the envelope. This is primarily evidenced by
the fact that in the part of the spectrum of IRAS 01005 available to us almost all these lines appear
in emission (the only exception is the 4128 and 4131 ˚A absorption–emission doublet). Furthermore,
averaging over the entire radial velocity data for the emission peaks yields a value close to −50 km s−1.
However, Si II lines diﬀer from the envelope emissions considered above by the shape and variability
of their proﬁles. The radial velocities of their peaks vary with time from −46 km s−1 to −54 km s−1,
and their residual intensities and halfwidths—by 10% and 30% respectively. The time scale of these
variations can hardly be determined from our data, however, note that these variations do not exceed
the measurement errors at least over two-day time intervals (November 25–27, 2002; November 13–15,
2005; and November 3–5, 2008).

Figure 6 shows examples of Si II line proﬁles. The dashed line shows the line enveloping of the 17
proﬁles of the strongest line, Si II 5979 ˚A, shifted along the Vr axis. It resembles the silhouette of Mount
Fuji on Japanese woodblock prints: a sharp peak (r ≈ 1.22), incurved slopes (∆Vr ≈ ±20 km s−1 at
half maximum), and a broad base (up to ±90 km s−1). The proﬁle of the Si II 6347 ˚A line becomes
sharply asymmetric from time to time: one of its slopes “sags,” sometimes even below the continuum
level (e.g., the blue slope on April 13, 2003). These proﬁle deformations may be due, as in the case
of hydrogen lines, to variations of their absorption (photospheric) components and also to variations
of the geometry and kinematics at the wind base. An inspection of columns 6 and 7 of Table 1 shows
that the proﬁles of April 13, 2003 and November 15, 2005 compared in Fig. 6 correspond to almost
equal absorption-feature radial velocities.

As we pointed out above, the Hα lines, free from superimposing narrow envelope emissions, have
P Cyg III-type, i.e., almost wind-type, proﬁles. Figure 7 illustrates this fact for two wind intensity levels
(the residual intensity of the red Hα and Hβ emission peaks varies by 50% and 70% over our entire

observed data set). The main emission peaks and absorption depressions are located on opposite sides
of the vertical line that marks the velocity determined from forbidden emissions (−50.5 km s−1). As
is evident from the last two columns of Table 1, for Hα and Hβ this also remains true for all our
remaining spectra. Note that both the shifts ∆Vr = (Vr+50.5 km s−1) and their scatter are small:
−74 < ∆Vr < −27 km s−1 for the Hα absorption minimum and 18< ∆Vr <31 km s−1 for the main
emission peak. Such a relatively low wind velocity, as well as the high intensity of the red emission
peak (it exceeds the continuum level by up to a factor of seven), are typical of hypergiants rather than
classical supergiants. Hence IRAS 01005 represents a case of spectral mimicry of a low mass post–AGB
star masquerading as a massive hypergiant.

The deviations of the wind structure from spherical symmetry are small. This is evidenced by the
symmetry in the lower parts of the Hα proﬁles (1.2< r <1.8), the fact that the radial velocities Vr
inferred from them are close to −50 km s−1, the inverse correlation between the intensities of the blue
and red emission peaks, as well as the inverse correlation between the depth of the absorption minimum
and the height of the red emission peak and the direct correlation between the absorption depth and
its blueshift. The conclusion about insigniﬁcant deviations of the wind from spherical symmetry is
consistent with the shape of the circumstellar envelope of IRAS 01005. Si´odmiak et al. [17] classiﬁed the
high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope image of this object as belonging to the SOLE morphological
type, which is dominated by the ﬂux of the central star. The circumstellar envelope is irregular and
contains several lobes of diﬀerent size.

The He I proﬁles are more diverse. Figure 8 shows pairs of most dissimilar He I 5876 and 5016 ˚A line
proﬁles. The He I 5876 ˚A line, which is the strongest in the visible part of the spectrum, forms higher
than the other He I lines, and therefore it is not surprising that in 12 out of our 20 spectra its proﬁle
reproduces the direct P Cyg proﬁle of the Hβ or Hα line and follows its intensity variations. This
similarity persisted, e.g., from November 22 through December 3, 2002. Another case is illustrated
in Fig. 8 by the proﬁle of April 13, 2003, where the shifts of the extrema (i.e., the ∆Vr quantity
introduced above) are equal to −45 and 22 km s−1, or, for Hα, −50 and 31 km s−1. However, such
similarity often disappears. In the proﬁle of November 13, 2005, shown in the same ﬁgure, the main
emission peak is on the blue rather than the red side of the absorption depression with the shift equal

downwards by 0.5). The solid lines show the proﬁles with the highest and lowest emission intensity
(taken on April 13, 2003 and November 13, 2005 for 5876 ˚A, and on December 2, 2002 and May 29,
2013 for 5016 ˚A, respectively), and the dashed lines show the lines enveloping of the corresponding
sets of proﬁles.

to ∆Vr ≈ −32 km s−1 and −6 km s−1 for the former and latter respectively. The corresponding shifts
for Hβ are equal to +17 and −25 km s−1. Note that this is not the case of the direct P Cyg proﬁle
of the He I 5876 ˚A line becoming an inverse P Cyg proﬁle, because both the emission and absorption
features are located on the same side of the “−50 km s−1 line.”

The proﬁle of the weaker He I 5016 ˚A line is less complex and more stable, it contains a single and
rather narrow emission component (with an average halfwidth of 18 km s−1). The most variable of its
parameters is the residual intensity, which, according to our data, varies by about 30%, whereas the
radial velocity oscillates near the “−50 km s−1 line” from −62 to −43 km s−1.

The proﬁles of even weaker He I lines become increasingly similar to the emission-absorption proﬁles
of the heavier elements: C II, N II, and Fe III (Fig. 9). The latter features have the most typical proﬁles
and we therefore list the velocities of their extrema in column 8 of Table 1 (the similarity of the
proﬁles allowed us to replace the unavailable reliable Fe III lines by He I line measurements in two
cases). Interpreting the proﬁles of the He I 4713 ˚A and other lines as inverse P Cyg proﬁles, i.e., as
a manifestation of the global contraction of their formation layers, appears to be justiﬁed in some
cases, however, most of our spectra show only an emission superimposed onto the blue slope of the
absorption proﬁle. The upper part of Fig. 9 demonstrates this fact by an example of the proﬁle of the
pure absorption O II 4676 ˚A line of similar intensity.

The lines that form at the wind base and in the transition layer between the wind and the pho-
tosphere are also variable in all their parameters. Our data demonstrates conclusively the proﬁle
variations at least over a two–day time interval. This is immediately apparent from Fig. 10. Whereas
the diﬀerences between the He I 5048 ˚A and N II 5679 ˚A line proﬁles appearing over a six-hour time
interval (the left-hand fragment of the ﬁgure) are still close to the measurement errors, the corre-
sponding variations over a two–day time interval (the right-hand fragment) become signiﬁcant and
quite measurable: thus the equivalent width of the N II 5679 ˚A line increased from 0.15 to 0.22 ˚A.

More or less pure photospheric absorptions are usually asymmetric: their cores are redshifted relative
to the wings. We therefore measured the radial velocities of these lines not only by their cores but

to r = 1.0.

Figure 11. Top: variation of the radial velocities of weak absorptions in the spectrum of IRAS 01005
measured by their cores (the ﬁlled circles) and wings (the open circles) from day to day (between
January 25, 2002 and August 21, 2013). The data for close dates are connected by solid lines; in
other cases—by dashed lines. The dates are marked for which the line proﬁles are given in the bottom
panel. Bottom: a comparison of the N II 4630 ˚A (left) and N II 5679 ˚A (right) proﬁles for dates with
large discrepancies between the measured radial velocity values.

Figure 11 shows graphically the radial velocities from columns 6 and 7 of Table 1. Their temporal
variations should be viewed relative to the radial velocity of the star as a whole, i.e., the systemic radial
velocity Vsys. It is reasonable to set this velocity equal to the radial velocity of forbidden emissions,
i.e., adopt Vsys = −50.5 km s−1. This assumption is supported by the fact that the radial velocity
values Vr for the wings, which correspond to the deepest accessible atmospheric layers, are closer to
the adopted Vsys than the Vr values for the line cores. More importantly, absorptions with Vr ≈Vsys
are least deformed by emission features or are even totally free of them (see the lower panels in Fig. 11,
where we compare the proﬁles of two N II lines at the epochs of large discrepancies between the inferred
radial velocity values). According to our data, the spread of Vr estimates for the line cores amounts
to 34 km s−1, and can partly be due to the deformations of the proﬁles by variable emission features.
The spread of Vr estimates for the wings is smaller, 23 km s−1, and can be interpreted as a result
of pulsations and/or hidden binarity of the star even despite the low accuracy of the corresponding
measurements. The hypothesis that the star may be pulsationally unstable is consistent with a similar
interpretation of the rapid variability of the photometric parameters of the star [12].

3.2. Binarity and pulsations of post-AGB stars

Many of the PPN candidates exhibit light and radial velocity variations on time scales of several
hundred days which may be indicative of their binary nature. Conclusive evidence for orbital motions
has been obtained for several optically bright stars undergoing the PPN stage. For example, the high-
latitude supergiants 89 Her [18, 19], HR 4049, HD 44179, and HD 52961 [20] are shown to be binary,
and the above authors determined the orbital elements and proposed the corresponding binary models
for these systems. The nature of the companions in suspected binary post–AGB stars so far remains
unknown because of the lack of their direct manifestations in the continuum or spectral lines: all the

 
 
 
12

Klochkova et al.: Spectral variability of the IR-source IRAS 01005+7910

known post–AGB binaries are of the SB1 type. A possible companion can be either a very hot object
or a low-luminosity main-sequence star. It can also be a white dwarf, like in the case of Ba–stars.

According to theoretical computations of Gautschy [21], pulsations are a typical feature of post-
AGB stars throughout a wide temperature interval, 3.8 ≤ log Teﬀ ≤ 4.9. Manifestations of atmospheric
pulsations were earlier found for a number of stars at the PPN stage. Such is the case of the well-studied
semiregular variable CY CMi (the optical component of the IR–source IRAS 07134+1005). The radial
velocity variability of this star was ﬁrst suspected in [22] from a comparison of the published data with
those obtained with the 6–m telescope. Somewhat later Lebre et al. [23] used the Fourier technique
to analyze the variability of the Hα proﬁle in the spectrum of CY CMi and the corresponding radial
velocity data, and concluded that the atmosphere of this star has complex pulsation driven dynamics.
Barth`es et al. [24] acquired an extensive set of quality spectra of CY CMi spanning an eight-year
period and concluded that the radial velocity of the star varies with a half-amplitude and main period
of 2.7 km s−1 and P = 36.d8 ± 0.2 respectively. Photometric variations have the same period and a very
small amplitude of 0.m02.

Klochkova et al. [25, 26] analyzed the kinematics of the atmosphere and envelope of CY CMi by
studying spectral features of various intensity, found the kinematic pattern to be variable, and pointed
out that the variations of the radial velocities measured from extremely weak absorptions possibly
indicate that the star is a binary, but may also be a manifestation of low-amplitude pulsations in
circumphotospheric layers. To determine conclusively whether CY CMi is a binary it is important to
monitor the Vr variations over several years acquiring one to two spectra every month.

Hrivnak et al. [27] analyzed the pulsations in the atmosphere of V448 Lac and in that of a related
post–AGB star V354 Lac (IRAS 22272+5435) based on long-term observations of light, color, and
radial-velocity variations. The above authors determined the periods, period ratios, and pulsation
amplitudes for these stars and found that the pulsation properties of post–AGB stars are not always
consistent with the results of theoretical computations for this evolutionary stage [28] and diﬀer from
the corresponding properties of classical Cepheids. The stars CY CMi, V354 Lac, and V448 Lac, which
were found to be pulsationally unstable, are a part of the group of F–type supergiants enriched in
carbon and s–process heavy metals synthesized during prior evolution. The basic information about
this group of related PPNe can be found in [11, 29]. Klochkova et al. [30] found evidence for variations
of the velocities of the absorption features in the spectrum of a hotter post–AGB star — the A–type
supergiant BD+48◦1220 = IRAS 05040+4820.

3.3. Lines of the Na I doublet and DIBs

The heliocentric radial velocities of the ﬁve main components of the Na I D lines (Fig. 1) averaged over
our entire dataset are equal to −72.5, −65.3, −52.2, −27.7, and −10.2 km s−1, and hence agree within
the quoted errors with the results reported in our previous paper [7] and with those reported in a recent
paper [9]. The weak component of the Na I D lines whose position corresponds to Vr = −52.2 km s−1
forms in the stellar atmosphere, whereas the two red components are of interstellar origin and form
in the Local arm of the Galaxy. The blue component (Vr = −65.3 km s−1) may also form in the
interstellar medium, in the Perseus arm. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of a similar
interstellar component with Vr ≈ −63 km s−1 in the spectra of the B-type stars HD 4841, HD 4694,
and Hiltner 62 [31], which are members of the Cas OB7 association. The Galactic latitudes of these
stars are close to that of IRAS 01005. This hypothesis leads us to conclude that IRAS 01005 should
be a very distant object. The distance to the Cas OB7 association is equal to d = 2.5 kpc [32] and can
be viewed as a lower estimate for the distance to IRAS 01005.

Note that Klochkova et al. [33[ also found a strong interstellar Na I D line component with a close
velocity Vr = −61.6 km s−1 in the spectrum of the faint G-type supergiant identiﬁed with the IR–
source IRAS 23304+6347, located close to the Galactic plane at a Galactic longitude that diﬀers by
about 10◦ from that of IRAS 01005.

As for the bluemost component of the Na I D lines with the velocity of Vr = −72.5, it seems
quite logical to conclude that it forms in the expanding circumstellar envelope in the system of the

Klochkova et al.: Spectral variability of the IR-source IRAS 01005+7910

13

IRAS 01005 source. In this case we derive an expansion velocity of Vexp ≈ 22 km s−1, which is typical
for PPNe (see [34, 29]).

The spectra of the B–type stars HD 4841, HD 4694, and Hiltner 62 contain DIBs with velocities
ranging from −11 to −14 km s−1 [31]. We also identiﬁed four DIBs in the spectra of IRAS 01005
at 5780, 5797, 6195, and 6613 ˚A. The positions of these features correspond to a radial velocity of
Vr = −13.5 km s−1, which agrees with the velocity inferred from three bands by Iglesias–Groth and
Esposito [9] and with the measurements made by Luna et al. [35] from the 5780 and 6613 ˚A bands.
The measurements of other DIBs in IRAS 01005 spectrum reported by Luna et al. [35] have large
errors. The same is true for the measurements of the positions of the components of the D lines of the
Na I doublet by the same authors.

3.4. Spectral type of the IRAS 01005 central star

We derive a spectral type of B1.5±0.3 for the star based only on the weak and minimally deformed
C II/III, N II/III, O II/III, Si III/IV, and other absorptions, and a direct comparison of the spectrum
of IRAS 01005 with those of V1853 Cyg (B1 Iae), 9 Cep (B2.3 Ib), and other early type supergiants
from the atlas [36]. The H I and He I lines yield a luminosity class Ib for IRAS 01005. Klochkova et
al. [7] found for IRAS 01005 a similar spectral–type estimate B1.7 ± 0.5. Note that the spectral types
of metal–poor stars with the chemical composition altered during evolution determined by comparing
the spectra of these objects with those of Population-I stars may be fraught with systematic errors.
The hot post–AGB supergiants V1853 Cyg [37], V886 Her [38], LS III 52◦24 [39], and several more
stars in the southern sky are related objects for IRAS 01005 [40, 41]. Gauba and Parthasarathy [42]
report a list of 15 hot post–AGB stars, analyze the speciﬁc features of their IR–spectra, and determine
the parameters of their circumstellar envelopes. Of special interest among the hot post-AGB stars is
the high-latitude Be–star V886 Her (IRAS 18062+2410), which is similar to IRAS 01005 in terms of
basic parameters. An analysis of extensive observational data for V886 Her suggests that it is rapidly
evolving toward the PN stage [43, 44, 45].

4. Conclusions

Based on 23 high-resolution spectra (R = 60 000) of the IR–source IRAS 01005+7910 that we took
with the 6–m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory, we determined the spectral type and
luminosity class (B1.5±0.3 Ib) of the central star, identiﬁed numerous spectral features, analyzed the
variations of their proﬁles and radial velocity.

We determined the systemic radial velocity of the star Vsys =−50.5 km s−1 from the positions of
symmetric and stable proﬁles of forbidden emission features of [N I], [N II], [O I], [S II], and [Fe II]. The
presence of forbidden emissions of [N II] and [S II] is indicative of the onset of the ionization of the
circumstellar envelope and the approaching planetary nebula stage.

The span of radial-velocity estimates Vr based on the line cores, which amounts to 34 km s−1, is
partially due to the proﬁle deformations caused by variable emissions. The span of Vr estimates based
on the line wings is smaller, about 23 km s−1, and can be due to pulsations and/or hidden binarity of
the star. The deformations of the proﬁles of absorption-emission lines may be due to the variations of
their absorption (photospheric) components with varying geometry and kinematics in the wind base.
Our observed data leads us to conclude that variations become quite measurable over a two–day time
interval.

The Hα lines have P Cyg III-type wind proﬁles. We show that deviations of the wind from spherical
symmetry are small. We ﬁnd the wind velocity to be small (27–74 km s−1 at diﬀerent observing epochs)
and the red emission to have high intensity (exceeding the continuum level by up to a factor of seven)
which is typical of hypergiants rather than classical supergiants.

According to our measurements, the heliocentric radial velocities of the ﬁve main components of
Na I D lines are equal to Vr =−72.5, −65.3, −52.2, −27.7, and −10.2 km s−1 (Fig. 1) and agree with
the published data within the errors. The weak component at Vr =−52.2 km s−1 forms in the stellar
atmosphere and the two redder components are of interstellar origin and form in the Local arm. The

14

Klochkova et al.: Spectral variability of the IR-source IRAS 01005+7910

presence of the Vr =−65.3 km s−1 component, which appears to form in the interstellar medium of
the Perseus arm, allows us to adopt d = 2.5 kpc as a lower estimate for the distance to IRAS 01005.
The bluemost component, Vr =−72.5 km s−1, may form in the circumstellar envelope expanding at a
velocity of Vexp ≈22 km s−1, which is typical of PPNe.

Table 2: Identiﬁcation of the lines in the spectrum of
IRAS 01005, their residual intensities (r) and heliocentric ra-
dial velocities (Vr). The letter “e” indicates the emissions
and emission components. Spectral variability prevents av-
eraging over several spectra, and therefore the 3530–4575 ˚A,
4590–5455 ˚A, and 5495–6731 ˚A wavelength intervals are rep-
resented by the spectra of November 15, 2003, November 13,
2005, and January 18, 2005, respectively. The less reliable
measurements are marked by colons.
