Nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimators have
been widely applied in analysis of productive eﬃciency. Typically
they are deﬁned in terms of convex-hulls of the observed combina-
tions of inputs × outputs in a sample of enterprises. The shape of
the convex-hull relies on a hypothesis on the shape of the technology,
deﬁned as the boundary of the set of technically attainable points
in the inputs × outputs space. So far, only the statistical properties
of the smallest convex polyhedron enveloping the data points has
been considered which corresponds to a situation where the tech-
nology presents variable returns-to-scale (VRS). This paper analyzes
the case where the most common constant returns-to-scale (CRS) hy-
pothesis is assumed. Here the DEA is deﬁned as the smallest conical-
hull with vertex at the origin enveloping the cloud of observed points.
In this paper we determine the asymptotic properties of this estima-
tor, showing that the rate of convergence is better than for the VRS
estimator. We derive also its asymptotic sampling distribution with
a practical way to simulate it. This allows to deﬁne a bias-corrected
estimator and to build conﬁdence intervals for the frontier. We com-
pare in a simulated example the bias-corrected estimator with the
original conical-hull estimator and show its superiority in terms of
median squared error.

1. Introduction. Consider a convex set Ψ in Rp+1

+ which takes the form

Ψ = {(x, y) ∈ Rp+1

+ : 0 ≤ y ≤ g(x)},
where g is a nonnegative convex function deﬁned on Rp
+ such that g(ax) =
ag(x) for all a > 0. Suppose that we have a random sample (Xi, Yi) drawn
from a distribution which is supported on Ψ. In this paper, we are inter-
ested in estimating the “boundary” function g from the random sample. In
particular, we study the asymptotic distribution of the estimator

Ψ is the convex-hull of the rays Ri ≡ {(γXi, γYi) : γ ≥ 0} for all sample

The problem arises in an area of econometrics where one is interested in
evaluating the performance of an enterprise in terms of technical eﬃciency.
In this context, Xi is the observed input vectors of the ith enterprise, Yi is
its observed productivity and Ψ is the production set of technically feasible
pairs of input and output. The property that g(ax) = ag(x) for all a > 0,
or, equivalently, Ψ = aΨ for all a > 0, is called “constant returns-to-scale”
(CRS), and the commonly used estimator of Ψ in this case is the CRS-version
of the data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimator deﬁned by

The problem that we describe in the ﬁrst paragraph can be generalized
to the case of vector-valued y ∈ Rq. This is particularly important in the
speciﬁc problem that we mention in the above paragraph where productivity
is typically measured in several variables. For this, we consider a conical-hull
of a convex set A in Rp+q
Ψ ≡ {(x, y) ∈ Rp+q

+ : there exists a constant a > 0 such that (ax, ay) ∈ A} ∪ {0}.

The set Ψ is convex and satisﬁes the CRS condition

for all a > 0.

We are interested in estimating the “directional edge” of Ψ in the y-space,
deﬁned by

λ(x, y) = sup{λ > 0 : (x, λy) ∈ Ψ}

using a random sample from a density supported on Ψ. In the case where
q = 1, the directional edge is linked directly to the boundary function g by
the identity g(x) = yλ(x, y). We consider the estimator

ˆλ(x, y) = sup{λ > 0 : (x, λy) ∈

To date, nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimators have
been discussed or applied in more than 1800 articles published in more than
400 journals [see Gattouﬁ, Oral and Reisman (2004) for a comprehensive bib-
liography]. DEA estimators are used to estimate various types of productive
eﬃciency of ﬁrms in a wide variety of industries as well as governmental
agencies, national economies and other decision-making units. The estima-
tors employ linear programming methods, similar to the one appearing in
(3), along the lines of Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (1978) who popularized
the basic ideas of Farrell (1957).

Typically these DEA estimators are indeed deﬁned in terms of convex-
hulls of the combinations of inputs × outputs (Xi, Yi) in a sample of ﬁrms.
The shape of the convex-hull relies on a hypothesis on the shape of the
technology deﬁned as the boundary of the set Ψ of technically attainable
points in the inputs × outputs space. So far, only the statistical proper-
ties of the smallest convex polyhedron enveloping the data points has been
considered which corresponds to a situation where the technology presents
variable returns-to-scale (VRS). Convergence results for DEA–VRS have
been derived by Korostelev, Simar and Tsybakov (1995) in the case of uni-
variate output and by Kneip, Park and Simar (1998) in the multivariate
case. Asymptotic distribution of the DEA–VRS estimators was obtained in
the bivariate case (p = q = 1) by Gijbels et al. (1999), for univariate output
by Jeong and Park (2006) and for the full multivariate case by Jeong (2004)
and Kneip, Simar and Wilson (2008).

VRS is a ﬂexible assumption, but in many situations the economist as-
sumes that the technology presents CRS: the ﬁrst version of the DEA estima-
tor derived by Farrell (1957) was for this situation. Here the DEA estimator
Ψ is deﬁned, as above, after (3), as the smallest conical-hull with a vertex
at the origin enveloping the cloud of observed points. The properties of this
b

4

B. U. PARK, S.-O. JEONG AND L. SIMAR

estimator have not been investigated, yet it was conjectured that one would
gain some eﬃciency in the estimation by imposing the appropriate CRS
structure to the estimator.

In this paper we determine the asymptotic properties of the DEA–CRS
estimator deﬁned in (3), showing that the rate of convergence is better than
that of the VRS estimator. We derive also its asymptotic sampling dis-
tribution with a practical way to simulate it. This allows us to deﬁne a
bias-corrected estimator and to build conﬁdence intervals for the frontier.
We compare, in a simulated example, the bias-corrected estimator with the
original DEA–CRS estimator and show its superiority in terms of median
squared error.

2. Rate of convergence.

In this section we give the ﬁrst theoretical result,
the convergence rate of the estimator ˆλ, as deﬁned in (3), in the general case
of p, q ≥ 1. Before presenting the result, we ﬁrst give two lemmas which will
be used in the proof of the ﬁrst theorem.

Lemma 1. For any α, β > 0, it holds that λ(αx, βy) = α
ever (αx, βy) ∈ Ψ and (x, y) ∈ Ψ. The same identity holds for ˆλ.

β λ(x, y) when-

Proof. The lemma follows from the CRS property (2) since

λ > 0 :

The following lemma is also derived from the convexity of Ψ and

Ψ.

Lemma 2. For all r ∈ [0, 1] and for all (x1, y1), (x2, y2) ∈ Ψ,

b

λ[r(x1, y1) + (1 − r)(x2, y2)] ≥ rλ(x1, y1) + (1 − r)λ(x2, y2).

The same inequality holds for ˆλ.

Our ﬁrst theorem on the rate of convergence relies on the following as-
sumptions. In what follows, we ﬁx the point in Ψ where we want to estimate
λ, and denote it by (x0, y0). Throughout the paper, we assume that (Xi, Yi)
are independent and identically distributed with a density f supported on
Ψ ⊂ Rp

+ and that (x0, y0) is in the interior of Ψ.

+ × Rq

(A1) λ(x, y) is twice partially continuously diﬀerentiable in a neighborhood

of (x0, y0).

(A2) The density f of (X, Y) on {(x, y) ∈ Ψ : k(x, y) − (x0, λ(x0, y0)y0)k ≤

ε} for some ε > 0 is bounded away from zero.

Theorem 1. Under the assumptions (A1) and (A2), it follows that

ˆλ(x0, y0) − λ(x0, y0) = Op(n−2/(p+q)).

Proof. We apply the technique of Kneip, Park and Simar (1998). Put

Bp(t, r) = {x ∈ Rp

p-vector with the jth element equal to 1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , p. Similarly, deﬁne
Ds = Bq(y(s)
0 , h/2) for s = 1, . . . , 2q. Take h small enough so that Cr ×Ds ⊂ Ψ
for all r = 1, . . . , 2p and s = 1, . . . , 2q. For r = 1, . . . , 2p, consider the conical
hull of Cr,

Cr = {x ∈ Rp

+ : ∃a > 0 such that ax ∈ Cr}.

Similarly, deﬁne Ds. Deﬁne

(Ur, Vs) = arg min

λ(Xi, Yi).

(Xi,Yi)∈Cr×Ds
Since the number of points in Xn falling into Ψ ∩ [Cr × Ds] is proportional
to nhp+q−2, we have by assumption (A2),
λ(Ur, Vs) = 1 + Op(n−1h−p−q+2),

r = 1, . . . , 2p, s = 1, . . . , 2q.

Taking h ∼ n−1/(p+q) completes the proof of the theorem. (cid:3)

Remark 1.

In the case where Ψ is a convex set in Rp+q without hav-
ing the CRS property (2), the DEA (data envelopment analysis) estimator
Ψ replaced by the convex-hull of (Xi, Yi) is com-
deﬁned as in (3) with
monly used. In this case, the DEA estimator of λ(x0, y0) is known to have
n−2/(p+q+1) rate of convergence which is slightly worse than n−2/(p+q) [see
Kneip, Park and Simar (1998)]. The CRS property reduces the “eﬀective”
dimension by one.

3. Asymptotic distribution.

In this section we derive a representation
for the asymptotic distribution of the estimator ˆλ deﬁned in (3). This rep-
resentation enables one to simulate the asymptotic distribution so that one
can correct the bias of the estimator to get an improved version of ˆλ. We
work with the case where q = 1 ﬁrst and then move to the general case where
q > 1. The result for the case q = 1 is essential for the generalization to q > 1.

3.1. The case where q = 1. We consider the set

Ψ = {(x, y) ∈ Ac × R+ : 0 ≤ y ≤ g(x)},

where g is a nonnegative convex function deﬁned on a conical-hull Ac of a
convex set A ⊂ Rp

+ such that

(5)

g(ax) = ag(x)

for all a > 0,

and that, for all x1, x2 ∈ Ac with x1 6= ax2 for any a > 0,

(6)

g(αx1 + (1 − α)x2) > αg(x1) + (1 − α)g(x2)

for all α ∈ (0, 1). In this case, λ(x0, y0) = g(x0)/y0 so that the problem of
estimating λ(x0, y0) reduces to that of estimating the function g at x0. The
estimator of g(x0) that corresponds to ˆλ(x0, y0) deﬁned in (3) is given by
ˆg(x0) = y0ˆλ(x0, y0) = sup{y : (x0, y) ∈

Ψ}.

(7)

We note that the CRS condition (5) is satisﬁed, not only by linear functions

of the form g(x) = c⊤x, but also by those functions g(x) = c(xr
for all positive numbers c and positive integers r.

Deﬁne Si by S⊤

T on Ψ such that the transformed data T (Si) behave, asymptotically, as an
i.i.d. sample from a uniform distribution on a region that can be represented
by a simple (p − 1)-dimensional quadratic function in the transformed space.
The reduction of the dimension, by one, for the boundary function is due
to the CRS property (5). This is consistent with the dimension reduction as
we noted in Remark 1 in the previous section.

ASYMPTOTIC DISTRIBUTION OF CONICAL-HULL ESTIMATORS

7

The key element in the derivation of the asymptotic distribution of ˆg(x0)
is to project the data Si onto a hyperplane which is perpendicular to the
vector x0 and passes through x0. The projected points lie under the locus
of the function g on the hyperplane, and the estimator ˆg(x0) equals the
maximal y such that (x0, y) belongs to the convex-hull of the projected
points. The asymptotic distribution of the estimator ˆg(x0) is then obtained
by analyzing the statistical properties of the convex-hull of the projected
points.

Let Q be a p × (p − 1) matrix whose columns constitute an orthonormal
0 , the subspace of Rp that is perpendicular to the vector x0.

Think of the transformation

(cid:19)

This transformation maps x to a vector which corresponds to x in the new
coordinate system where the axes are x0 and the columns of Q. The ﬁrst
component of T1(x) is nothing other than the projection of x onto the space
spanned by x0, and the vector of the rest components is its orthogonal
complement in Rp. Thus, the inverse transform T −1

is given by

where z⊤ = (z1, z⊤

It would be more convenient to use a transformation that takes x0 to
the origin in the new coordinate system. This can be done by the following
transformation:

for the inverse map of T2. In fact, kx0k2/x⊤
the projection of cx onto the linear span of x0 equals x0 itself. Thus

0 x is introduced to factor out a common scalar

Deﬁne a (p − 1)-dimensional function g∗ by g∗(z2) = g(x0 + Qz2). For a
function ψ, let ˙ψ and ¨ψ denote, respectively, the gradient vector and the
Hessian matrix of ψ. Since, for any u ∈ Rp−1,

u⊤¨g∗(z2)u = (Qu)⊤¨g(x0 + Qz2)(Qu)
and also (Qu)⊤(Qu) = u⊤u, it can be seen that g∗ is convex if g is convex.
In particular, (6) implies the strict convexity of g∗. Note that g∗ does not
have the CRS property (5), however.

Next, we introduce a further transformation on the new coordinate sys-
tem (z, y). This transformation maps the equation y = g∗(z2) to a perfect
quadratic equation in the further transformed space. Since g∗ is strictly con-
vex, −¨g∗(0)/2 = Q⊤(−¨g(x0)/2)Q is positive deﬁnite and symmetric. Thus,
there exist an orthogonal matrix P and a diagonal matrix Λ such that
−¨g∗(0)/2 = P ΛP ⊤. The columns of P are the orthonormal eigenvectors,
and the diagonal elements of Λ are the eigenvalues of the matrix −¨g∗(0)/2.
Let T3 be a transformation that maps Rp to Rp deﬁned by

(8)

T3 : z 7→ (z1, n1/(p+1)z⊤

2 P Λ1/2)⊤.

Note that this transformation does not change z1, the ﬁrst component of z.
Also, deﬁne a map T4 : Rp × R → R by

(cid:21)

The transformation we apply to the data (Xi, Yi) is now deﬁned by

T : (x, y) 7→ (T3 ◦ T2(x), T4(T2(x), y)).

We explain how the equation y = g(x) can be approximated, locally at
(x0, y0), by a (p − 1)-dimensional quadratic function in the new coordinate
system transformed by T . Let (v, w) ∈ Rp × R represent the new coordinate
system obtained by the transformation T . Write v⊤ = (v1, v⊤
2 ) with v2 be-
ing a (p − 1)-dimensional vector. Then, the inverse transform of T maps v
and w, respectively, to

Thus, for arbitrary compact sets C1 ⊂ Rp−1 and C2 ⊂ R, we obtain using
the CRS property (5) that, uniformly for v1 ∈ R+, v2 ∈ C1 and w ∈ C2,

y = g(x)

{E(Z1 − Z2)2 ∧ 1 : L(Z1) = µ1, L(Z2) = µ2}.

positive deﬁnite and continuous at 0 and that the density f of (X, Y ) is uni-
formly continuous on Hε(x0) for an arbitrarily small ε > 0. Let Ln1 and Ln2
denote the distributions of n2/(p+1)[ˆg(x0) − g(x0)] and Zn(0), respectively.
Then, d(Ln1, Ln2) → 0 as n tend to inﬁnity.

Computation of the distribution of Zn solely depends on knowledge of κ.
Thus one can approximate the distribution of ˆg(x0) by estimating κ and
then simulating Zn with the estimated κ. The approximation enables one to
correct the downward bias of ˆg(x0) and get an improved estimator of g(x0).
Estimation of κ and bias-correction for ˆg(x0) will be discussed in Section 4.

Proof of Theorem 2. We ﬁrst give a geometric description of the

estimator ˆg. Consider a hyperplane in Rp deﬁned by

Ψ(x0) ≡ {(x0 + Qz2, y) ∈ Ac × R+ : z2 ∈ Rp−1, 0 ≤ y ≤ g(x0 + Qz2)},

the set Ψ(x0) in (20) can be represented by {0} × Ψ∗(x0) where

Let f denote the density of the original random vector (X, Y ) and f ∗
denote the density of the transformed vector (Z2, Y ′). The arguments in
the preceding paragraph imply that the distribution of ˆg(x0) − g(x0) equals
that of ˆg∗(0) − g∗(0) where ˆg∗ is the convex-hull estimator of g∗ constructed
from a random sample of size n generated from the density f ∗. Let κ∗ =
det(Λ)−1/2f ∗(0, g∗(0)) where Λ is the diagonal matrix with its entries being
n as a version of ˆg∗ constructed from
the eigenvalues of −¨g∗(0)/2. Deﬁne Z ∗
a random sample from the uniform distribution on Rn(κ∗) ⊂ Rp where Rn
is deﬁned immediately after (11). Then one can proceed as in the proof of
Theorem 1 of Jeong and Park (2006) to show that the asymptotic distribu-
tion of n2/(p+1)(ˆg∗(0) − g∗(0)) is identical to that of Z ∗
n(0) where one uses
the transformations T ∗

T ∗
Recalling the deﬁnitions of the transformations T3 and T4 in (8) and (9),
3 (z2) equals T3(z) without the ﬁrst component, where z⊤ =

(z1, z⊤
equals κ deﬁned in (11) so that Z ∗
n = Zn in distribution which concludes the
proof of the theorem.

Let T ∗ denote the transformation that maps (x, y) to

(z, y′) = (T2(x), ykx0k2/(x⊤

0 x)).

Let c(z1) = (z1 + kx0k)/kx0k. The Jacobian of the inverse transform of T ∗
equals

J(z) ≡ c(z1) det[kx0k−1(x0 + Qz2), c(z1)Q]

= c(z1) det1/2

(cid:21)

where Ip−1 denotes the identity matrix of dimension (p − 1). The second
equality in the above calculation follows from the fact that the columns of
Q are perpendicular to x0. Thus the joint density of T ∗(X, Y ) at the point
(z, y′) is given by J(z)f (c(z1)(x0 + Qz2), c(z1)y′). The density f ∗(z2, y′) is
simply the marginalization of this joint density with respect to z1 so that

To see how well the distribution of n2/(p+1){ˆg(x0) − g(x0)} is approxi-
mated by that of Zn(0), we took a Cobb–Douglas CRS production func-
tion g(x) = x0.4
(p = 2). We generated 5000 random samples of size
x−0.6λ
n = 100 and 400 from f (x1, x2, y) = λx−0.4λ
yλ−1 supported on Ψ =

{(x1, x2, y) : 0 ≤ x1, x2 ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ g(x1, x2)}. This yielded i.i.d. copies of
(X1, X2, Y ) with X1 ∼ Uniform[0, 1], X2 ∼ Uniform[0, 1] and Y =
g(X1, X2)e−V /λ where V ∼ Exp(1). Figures 2 and 3 depict the empirical
distributions of n2/(p+1){ˆg(x0) − g(x0)} and Zn(0) based on these samples
in the case where λ = 3. The ﬁgures suggest that the approximation is fairly
good for moderate sample sizes and get better as the sample size increases.
Theorem 2 excludes the case where g is linear; that is, g(x) = c⊤x for
some vector c. The latter case needs a diﬀerent treatment. In the following
theorem, we give the limit distribution in this case. To state the theorem,
let (VL

Proof.

In this case we consider the following transformation:

(24)

T L : (x, y) 7→ (T L

3 ◦ T2(x), T L

4 (T2(x), y)),

where T L

(cid:19)

Let (VL, W L) = T L(X, Y ). Then it can be shown as in the proof of Theorem
2 that the density of (VL
2 , W L) is given by n−1θ{1 + o(1)} uniformly for vL
2
and wL in any compact sets of respective dimension. The rest of the proof
is the same as that for Theorem 2. (cid:3)

In the special case where p = 1, we can derive the limit distribution ex-
plicitly. In this case, the boundary function g is linear and takes the form
g(x) = cx for some constant c > 0. The transformation T L in (24) reduces

3.2. The case where q > 1.

In this section we extend the results in the
previous section to the case where q > 1 and Ψ is a conical-hull of a convex
set A in Rp+q
+ . For this we make a canonical transformation on y-space so
that the problem for q > 1 is reduced to the case where q = 1. Again we ﬁx
the point (x0, y0) where we want to estimate the function λ.

Let Γ be a q × (q − 1) matrix whose columns form a basis for y⊥

a transformation T that maps y ∈ Rq

+ to (u, ω) ∈ Rq−1 × R+ where

0 . Consider

(25)

Then, in the new coordinate system (x, u, ω), the set Ψ can be represented

(cid:19)

Also, it has the CRS property (5) since Ψ satisﬁes (2). Furthermore, since
(x, y) ∈ Ψ if and only if (x, T (y)) ∈ ΨT , and T (αy0) = (0⊤, αky0k)⊤ for all
α > 0, we obtain

gT (x0, 0) = sup

= ky0kλ(x0, y0).

Here and below, 0 denotes the (q − 1)-dimensional zero vector. Thus the
problem of estimating λ(x0, y0) using (Xi, Yi) is reduced to that of estimat-
ing gT (x0, 0) in the transformed space using (Xi, T (Yi)).

We note that in the proof of Theorem 2 we use only convexity and the
CRS property of g. Thus the theory we developed in the previous section
is applicable to gT . Let (Ui, Ωi) = T (Yi) where Ui is the vector of the ﬁrst
(q − 1) elements of T (Yi), and Ωi is the scalar-valued random variable. The
joint density of (Xi, Ui, Ωi) at the point (x, u, ω) is given by

QT is a (p + q − 1) × (p + q − 2) matrix whose columns form an orthonormal

T ¨gT (x0, 0)QT /2)−1/2.
κT = θT det(−Q⊤

Recall that the construction of Zn deﬁned in (12) depends only on κ and
p. Deﬁne Zn,T as a version of Zn with κT and (p + q − 1) replacing κ
and p, respectively. Also, deﬁne a (p + q − 2)-dimensional function g∗
T (z2) =
gT ((x0, 0) + QT z2), and Hε,T (x0, 0) as Hε(x0) at (13) with (p + q − 1),
gT , (x0, 0) and QT replacing p, g, x0 and Q, respectively. Then we have
the following theorem for the limit distribution of ˆλ(x0, y0) for arbitrary
dimensions p, q ≥ 1.

Theorem 4. Assume (A1) and (A2). In addition, assume that −¨g∗
T
is positive deﬁnite and continuous at 0, and that the density fT given at
(28) is uniformly continuous on Hε,T (x0, 0) for an arbitrarily small ε > 0.
Let Ln1 and Ln2 denote the distributions of n2/(p+q)[ˆλ(x0, y0) − λ(x0, y0)]
and Zn,T (0p+q−2)/ky0k, respectively. Then, d(Ln1, Ln2) → 0 as n tends to
inﬁnity.

Theorem 4 excludes the case where Ψ = {(x, y) ∈ Rp+q

2 y ≥ 0}
for some constant vectors c1, c2 > 0. Below we treat this case. When q = 1,
this corresponds to the case where the boundary function g is linear in x.

Let RL

4. Estimation of κ and κT . We discuss how to estimate κ as deﬁned in
(11) for the case where q = 1. It is straightforward to extend the methods to
the case where q > 1 via the canonical transformation that we introduced in
Section 3.2.

Consider the set Hε(x0) ⊂ Rp+1

+ deﬁned in (13). The projection of this set
on the x-space is a conical hull around the vector x0, and for each direction
of the ray x0 + Qz2, determined by z2, its section on that direction is also a
conical hull of single dimension under the boundary g. For each ﬁxed u ≥ 0,
let

Hε(u; x0) = {(u(x0 + Qz2), y) : kz2k ≤ ε,

g(u(x0 + Qz2)) − uε ≤ y ≤ g(u(x0 + Qz2))}.

This is a section of Hε(x0) obtained by cutting Hε(x0) perpendicular to x0
at the distance ukx0k from the origin. Its volume in the cutting hyperplane
uP †(x0), where P †(x0) is deﬁned between (14) and (15), equals

vε(u) = cp−1upεp,
where cr denote the volume of the r-dimensional unit ball, that is, cr =
Γ(r/2+1) with Γ(z) =

∞
0 tz−1e−tdt. Thus, as ε → 0 we have

This consideration motivates the following estimator of θ:

I((Xi, Yi) ∈

Hε(x0)),

Xi=1
where ˆHε(x0) is the sample version of Hε(x0) with g replaced by ˆg in its
deﬁnition. Note that, for implementing ˆθ, it is convenient to use the fact,

b

(Xi, Yi) ∈ ˆHε(x0) ⇔ kZ2ik ≤ ε,

ˆg∗(Z2i) − ε ≤ Y ′

i ≤ ˆg∗(Z2i).

It is straightforward to see that ˆθ is a consistent estimator of θ under the
conditions of Theorem 2.

For estimating det(Λ), one can apply local polynomial ﬁtting to {(Z2i,
ˆg∗(Z2i))}. For a small δ > 0, perform a second-order polynomial regression
on the set of the points

{(Z2i, ˆg∗(Z2i)) : kZ2ik ≤ δ, i = 1, 2, . . . , n} ∪ {(0, ˆg∗(0)},

to get

(30)

˘g∗(z) = ˘g0 + ˘g′

1z + z′˘g2z.

Use det(˘g2) as an estimator of det(Λ). An estimator of κ is then deﬁned by
ˆκ = ˆθ det(˘g2)−1/2.

Using the estimator of κ one can obtain a bias-corrected estimator of the
function g∗. For this, one generates Zn repeatedly as described at (12) using
the estimated κ. Call them Zn,1, Zn,2, . . . , Zn,B. A bias-corrected estimator
is then deﬁned by

ˆg∗(0) − n−2/(p+1) ¯Zn,·(0),

B
b=1 Zn,b(0). Also, a 100 × (1 − α)% conﬁdence interval

where ¯Zn,·(0) = B−1
is given by

P

[ˆg∗(0) − n−2/(p+1)Zn,(B(1−α/2))(0), ˆg∗(0) − n−2/(p+1)Zn,(Bα/2)(0)],

where Zn,(j)(0) are the ordered values Zn,j(0) such that Zn,(1)(0) > Zn,(2)(0) >
· · · > Zn,(B)(0).

5. Numerical study.

In this section we investigate, by a Monte Carlo
experiment, the behavior of the sampling distribution of the DEA–CRS
estimator in ﬁnite samples. To be more speciﬁc we will compare if the bias-
corrected estimator suggested above has better properties than the original
DEA–CRS estimator in terms of median squared error.

For our Monte Carlo scenario, we adapted the scenario proposed in Kneip,
Simar and Wilson (2008) to our setup. The eﬃcient frontier is deﬁned with
a CRS generalized Cobb–Douglas production function,

So we are in a situation with p = q = 2, and we will analyze the estimation
of the eﬃciency score of the ﬁxed point x0 = (15, 15), y0 = (10, 10). It is easy
to see that the true value of the parameter to estimate is λ0 = λ(x0, y0) =
1.0607. We analyze the cases n = 100 and n = 400.

We performed 500 Monte Carlo simulations and computed the squared
errors of the original DEA–CRS estimator and of the bias-corrected estima-
tor. Table 1 summarizes the results. It gives the ratios of the median of the

where ˆλ0,j and ˜λ0,j denote the original DEA–CRS estimate and the bias-
corrected estimate computed in the jth Monte Carlo replication, respec-
tively. Note that the bias-corrected estimator relies on the values of the
smoothing parameters (ε, δ) which appear in the deﬁnitions (29) and (30),
respectively.

It is observed from the table that the bias-correction works very well
for a wide range of the smoothing parameters, even though the smooth-
ing parameters were taken to be equal in the simulation study for saving
computational costs. We see also that the performance of the bias-corrected
estimator gets better when compared to the original DEA–CRS as the sam-
ple size increases.

6. Discussion.

In this paper we developed the theoretical properties of
the DEA estimator deﬁned in (3) in the case where the support Ψ of the
data (Xi, Yi) satisﬁes the CRS condition (2). The assumption of CRS may
be tested. In fact, whether the underlying technology exhibits CRS or VRS
is a crucial question in studying productive eﬃciency. The question has
important economic implications. If the technology does not exhibit CRS,
then some production units may be found to be either too large or too small.
Using the estimator at (3) in the case where the true technology displays
nonconstant returns to scale results in statistically inconsistent estimates of
eﬃciency and seriously distorts measures of eﬃciency.

One way to test CRS against VRS is to use the test statistic deﬁned as

ρn =

1

ˆλVRS(Xi, Yi)

where ˆλVRS is a version of ˆλ for the case of VRS deﬁned as in (3) but with
Ψ replaced by the convex-hull of {(Xi, Yi)}n

i=1. By construction,

b

ˆλ(Xi, Yi) ≥ ˆλVRS(Xi, Yi) > 0

so that ρn ≥ 0. A larger value of ρn gives a stronger evidence against the
null hypothesis of CRS in favor of the alternative hypothesis of VRS. The
test statistic was considered by Simar and Wilson (2002). One may com-
pute p-values or critical values using a bootstrap method. For example, a
subsampling scheme with the subsample size determined by the procedure
described in Politis, Romano and Wolf (2001) might work for this problem.
For testing CRS against nonconstant returns-to-scale, which is broader than
VRS, one may use the estimators analyzed by Hall, Park and Stern (1998)
and Park (2001) instead of ˆλVRS. Theoretical and numerical properties of
these testing procedures are yet to be developed.
