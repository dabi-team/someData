1 AR/VR Glasses with Medical Applications

Authors: Gerd Häusler, Aleksandra Milczarek, Markus Schreiter, Thomas Kästner, Flo-
rian Willomitzer, Andreas Maier

1.1 Problem Statement

For the prevention of eye diseases an early diagnosis and treatment is necessary. This
requires simple means for detection. Multiple eye malfunction / diseases as well as
personal parameters (e.g. fatigue), which can be detected by eye movements, are not
frequently monitored. For some diseases, which cannot be treated (e.g. color blind-
ness), augmented reality approaches can be used for the compensation or even to sup-
port the users without diseases in critical vision situations (e.g.
low light, fog). No
current method or device that combines both augmented reality (AR) and virtually real-
ity (VR). No device for the gradual reduction of the transparency of glasses for each eye
separately. No current method or device that stimulates the eye based on the analysis of
cardiac cycle signals.

Disadvantages of the state of the art:

Smart glasses do not support eye observation for medical diagnostics as well as
long term observations of the human eye.

Projection of augmented reality by smart glasses does not exist for both eyes
simultaneously.

No local zoom function that considers eye and head movement.

Transparency of the glasses cannot be gradually reduced. This would enable sun-
glasses as well as switching between virtually reality (VR) and augmented reality
(AR) for instance for zoom function.

No real time color correction/ enhancement as well as compensation of color vi-
sion deﬁciency

No vision enhancement based on AR due to cardiac cycle signals

•

•

•

1.2 Proposed Method

•

•

Providing a method and wearable device for the detection and compensation of
eye dysfunction and diseases. Eye motion is detected using eye tracking tech-
niques.

Visual feedback in daily life based on cardiac cycle signal (also for ordinary
/healthy people). I.e. the system can inform users about stress and arousal and
ask them to rest or cool down. Identiﬁcation of excessive and sudden exposure to
light will cause stress with can be identiﬁed and circumvented.

•

System is able to work as AR and VR system at the same time. AR contrast can
be improved using only partial / pixel-wise opacity. Pixels that come from the AR
/ VR world are no longer mixed with the real world signal. This results in a more
realistic experience.

•

System also analyzes the light sources with additional sensors and is able to render
AR objects with realistic shading.

Setup:

wearable device

eye glass/es with adjustable transparency (e.g. e-paper / e-ink)

projector/s for augmented reality (to the eye)

camera/s to observe the eyes

camera/s to observe the real world

•

•

•

•

•

Sensor/s for cardiac cycle monitoring

•
Both eye movements are observed by separate cameras. Algorithmic evaluation of the
eye movement for pre-diagnostics (e.g saccades, average motion, average speed, distri-
bution of movements and speed, maximal motion) of possible diseases (e.g. Glaucoma,
dementia, etc.) and other conditions of the user (fatigue, stress, fear, etc.). Material
with adjustable transparency (e.g. FLCOS display) is embedded in each glass to enable
dimming. Via augmented reality AND virtual reality approaches, people with eye mal-
functions are supported in daily life. For VR, the glasses have to be completely dimmed.
Some additional sensors (e.g. heartbeat-sensors) are embedded on the inside of the bails
to support monitoring functions and can be used for adaption purposes.

Examples for possible usages:

•

•

•

•

•

•

Edge enhancement in real time (e.g.: under low light condition)

Ampliﬁcation in low light situations

Dimming in bright situations

Magniﬁcation of the current ﬁeld of view. Also with view-in-view mode or only
magniﬁcation in partial areas of the ﬁeld of view.

Enabling VR by the gradually reduction of transparency to zero (for one or both
glasses). Therefore virtual images are projected either in one or both eyes (e.g.:
magniﬁcation of the current ﬁeld of view -> zoom function, can be used for en-
tertainment purpose, etc.)

cardiac cycle signals, information from eye observation and mimic are measured
and analyzed (e.g.: for detection of an acute stroke event, etc.). Thus for instance
conclusions regarding diseases, the emotional state and mood can be made.

Based on the interpretation of the measured signals the eye is stimulated (AR). For
instance: dimming light in bright situations, Edge enhancement and Ampliﬁcation
in low light condition (in real time)

increasing color intensity, changing color values adding object to the reality (AR
applications e.g.: entertaining purpose, adding a 3D objects into the ﬁeld of view
[for instance: a Porsche in front of your garage, education purpose: overlaying re-
ality with virtual images such as showing a dinosaur in the classroom], simulation
of color blindness)

Further usage of AR applications for increase the intensity of colors (entertaining
application for fun)

Color blindness compensation by overlaying intrinsic color with information that
are visible to the subject (AR for medical usage). Kind and degree of color blind-
ness is estimated from a dedicated test protocol that can be run in VR mode. AR
mode compensates for color blindness by interpolating false colors into the scene.

Method can also be extended to hyper spectral imaging where colors that can-
not be differentiated by the eye (metamers) are in addition acquired by a hyper
spectral camera mounted on the glasses. Metamers can then be displayed in false
colors in the AR system.

1.3 Advantages of the Idea

•

•

•

•

•

Support of eye observation for medical diagnostics as well as long term observa-
tions of the human eye. (on the principle of smart glasses the data are stored on
an external device, also analyses can be outsourced)

Projection of augmented reality by smart glasses simultaneously for both eyes.
(stereo vision)

Local zoom function that considers eye and head movement (by using eye track-
ing the focus point of the subject is detected, simultaneously focused object is
enlarged and projected into the eye -> VR)

Transparency of the glasses can be gradually reduced. This enables sunglasses as
well as switching between virtually reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) for
instance for zoom function.

Real time color correction or enhancement as well as compensation of color vision
deﬁciency. Color blindness has to be determined in a VR calibration phase. (color
blindness reduced for instance by overlaying the real world with virtual images
that contain colors with changed color values; color enhancement is based on the
same principle: overlaying reality with a virtual image projected in the eye)

•

Recording of cardiac cycle signals and analyzation (usage for: e.g. vision en-
increased
hancement based on AR, several diseases, etc.); (possible scenario:

heart beat frequency is detected, furthermore mimic is analyzed, etc. -> conclu-
sions on the emotional state -> timing the light/changing the color in order to
enable quick relaxation to normal stress state)

•

Combination with additional hardware components possible (e.g. IR camera - for
night vision, thermography, etc.)

1.4 Detectability of the Idea in a Product

Combination of AR and VR in one device

Color correction/visual improvement based on AR

Visual enhancement in daily life (zoom function, etc.)

2 Augmented Reality Eye Surgery

Author: Florian Schiffers

2.1 Problem Statement

Endoscopic surgery inside the eye is a difﬁcult task due to two reasons. 1) Vision/health
of the patient is constantly endanderegd during operation, and 2) inside-the-eye-image
quality is bad since image retrieval is difﬁcult. Estimation of position and orientation of
the operating/imaging devices inside the eye is difﬁcult for the surgeon. Thus, naviga-
tion inside the eye is tricky. Different imaging (2D and 3D) techniques of the eye are
already state-of-the-art (OCT, fundus, CT, MRI). Currently no techniques using prior in-
formation about the eye is used in a setup for eye-surgeon guidance. Augmented reality
methods for minimal invasive surgery is state-of-the-art, but no methods are designed
speciﬁcally for inside eye-surgery.

2.2 Proposed Method

A novel setup for augmented reality for endoscopic eye surgery is presented. Additional
patient information (obtained by prior 2D/3D imaging of the patient eye) is used to
provide better real-time guidance for surgeons eventually leading to higher success rates
in operations and enable new kind of eye operations, which are currently too risky for
the patient. A 3D model of the patient eye is created in the operation planning phase. 3D
modeling can be done by applying any technique leading to a 3D model of the human
eye. Possible techniques are OCT, CT, MRI or topography measurement of the eye ball
from the outside. Assuming a 3D model of the eye is given (see above), a virtual camera
is now placed on the tip of the operating device (e.g. tweezers). If desired, the surgeon
can choose any artiﬁcial position and orientation of the virtual camera. he 3D model is
augmented with prior acquired images (e.g. fundus imaging) or in-vivo images during
operation, for example from a second endoscope.

Further – on the ﬂy – reﬁnement of the 3D model is done by using real time infor-
mation (e.g. by employing Structure-From-Motion techniques). Additional knowledge
(like tumor segmentation, vessels) is augmented on the 3D model to provide further
guidance. The additional information, which should be augmented, is displayed on an
external device. For example: monitor or virtual reality glasses.

External or internal 3D tracking of the endoscopic devices and is mandatory. An
external real time tracking of the location and pose of both, the eye and the operating
devices inside the eye, are crucial. Any tracking providing information about position
and orientation above can be used, among those are optical and robot-guided track-
ing for the endoscopic devices and optical (interferometry, triangulation, deﬂectromtry)
techniques for the eye. Information of the position and pose of the operating device
and eye is combined by registration techniques to have well deﬁned coordinate system
enabling software solution for augmented reality.

Additional information can conveyed to the surgeon if needed:

•

Thickness of the different layers is segmented from the OCT and displayed as
additional parameters

9

•

•

•

Biological important structures (e.g. Vessels, Tumors) are highlighted during op-
eration

Pressure of the operating devices is measured by mounted device and displayed

Distance to retina of the operating device is displayed as colored information. In
case operating device is close to critical areas in the eye, feedback (optical or
haptic) is given to warn the surgeon

Generated 3D models can printed out. Assuming a high quality artiﬁcial replica of
the eye can be provided, the artiﬁcial eye can be used for training scenarios for (future)
eye surgeons with our proposed setup.

Optionally:

•

Endoscopic devices can be controlled by remote reducing the risk during opera-
tion since the surgeon is never free of errors or external distraction in the operating
room

•

The software solutions allows for easy integration into a fully automated setup
using robots

2.3 Advantages of the Idea

The idea enables better visualization methods assisting the surgeon leads to higher op-
eration success rates or even new operation methods. In addition, it enables better guid-
ance of the endoscope and operating device.

2.4 Detectability of the Idea in a Product

Augmented reality approaches comprising a prior generated 3D Model are always dis-
played on an external device (e.g. monitor, virtual reality glasses). Real-time tracking
device of endoscope and eye has to be present in the operation room

3 Game Diagnosis

Authors: Stefan Steidl, Temitope Paul Onanuga, Mathias Unberath, Florian Dötzer,
Maike Stöve, Jonas Hajek

3.1 Problem Statement

While regular examinations of childrens eye health by a doctor are common today, the
intervals in between them are of the order of a year or at least months. As changes
in eye health can take place much faster than this, the need for early diagnosis arises.
Furthermore, children often are not very cooperative during examinations at a doctor,
potentially falsifying the results of subjective tests there.

The idea shall offer constant monitoring of children’s eye health at home. It allows
parents to get notiﬁcations when their child’s behavior changes in a way that could be
connected to an impairment of their eyesight. It is not designed to replace the exami-
nations at a doctor, but it shall offer the additional ability to react to health issues more
quickly and have a visit at the doctor earlier then. Applications that test someones eye-
sight are widely available, but they usually rely on the active involvement of the child.
Our solution provides passive testing, i.e. without the child even noticing it is being
tested.

3.2 Proposed Method

The idea is to integrate hidden eyesight tests into video games. One can then create
statistics about the child’s success in different situations and how this changes over
time. Similar ideas were proposed in US6808267B2, US8931905B2, EyeSpy 20/20.
As in US6808267B2, US8931905B2, US9433346B2, the necessary hardware includes:

Computer (e.g. console, PC)

Screen (of known size)

Device that measures distance between a person and the screen

Ambient light sensor

•

The computer and screen are standard technology and assumed as present. The size of
the screen must be known. This information may be supplied over the video-cable or,
if this is not possible, it would have to be entered by hand during set-up. Hardware that
is able to track the distance between a person and the screen is available, too: It could
consist of a simple camera that is calibrated once and then computes the distance from
the size of the face. Other options would be triangulating stereo-cameras or ultrasonic
sensors. Ambient light sensors are commonly found in TVs or could also be integrated
into the distance measuring device. Most smartphones bring all necessary hardware
with them as well.

The tests may either be dedicated mini-games (during loading-breaks or inside the ac-
tual game in certain situations) or they can be directly integrated into the game. The
latter has been proposed previously in US6808267B2, US8931905B2, US9433346B2,
US7427135B2, EyeSpy 20/20. A new feature is that the games in our case are no spe-
cialised screening games for use in schools or at the ophthalmologist, but that the tests
are supposed to be integrated in common games that children actually want to play at
home, too. This will increase the frequency of how often the game is played and there-
fore also how often the test is conducted. The realization of eye tests as a mini-game
inside a larger game has to our knowledge never been proposed until now and it offers
the unique advantage that the tests can be designed very speciﬁc (without the restric-
tions that are present when implemented into a larger game) and that at the same time

the child is being motivated by the larger surrounding game. It is essential that it is
a ’real’ game that is not identifyable as a vision test in order to provide the necessary
motivation for children. As already pointed out in US6808267B2, US9433346B2, fur-
ther motivation can be provided by rewarding the child with ingame credits for correct
actions.

In any case the success has to depend on the childrens capability to resolve and rec-
ognize certain features on the screen (see examples in Figures 1-5). A mini-game could
be game-mechanics-wise completely decoupled from the main game. This would allow
for more concrete tests, while the integration into a normal game would require more
subtle methods and thus also an evaluation that depends more on statistics than on in-
dividual results. For example, in a mini-game, the player could have to ﬁnd a certain
symbol in some static image (possibly a scene from the main game). Another option
would be to have moving objects, bearing different labels or having slightly different
shape, and the player should only click on the ones with a certain label/shape. For the
integrated scenario it would be quite similar: The player would have to interact differ-
ently with certain objects depending on their label/shape. They could be integrated into
the game for example as power-ups, persons, items, switches or alike.

The impairments that could be monitored are:

•

Far- and shortsightedness: This is one of the most basic ophthalmic measure-
ments. While some of our ideas are already present e.g.
in US6808267B2,
US7427135B2 they are in these cases not combined in the way as it is described
in the following. Two things can be evaluated:
1) The average distance the child has to the screen, as it will choose a position
from where it can see the screen in a comfortable way. If it is shortsighted it will
probably sit closer to the screen while it will sit farther away when it is farsighted.
2) By investigating what features can apparently be resolved at what viewing dis-
tance, one can compute the angular resolution for different viewing distances.
This should be similar for all viewing distances.
If it is conspicuously low at
high or low viewing distances, it could be due to short- or farsightedness again
(shortsightedness not really testable on smartphones). The features could simply

•

be letters, or more complex symbols (representing certain mechanisms or items
or groups in the game)

Color vision capability: As already stated in US6808267B2, US7427135B2,
EyeSpy 20/20, one can estimate what color contrasts the child was able to distin-
guish. In case of a colorblindness or impaired color vision, this would lead to not
being able to detect a feature of a certain color in front of a background of another
color, as seen in Figure 1.

Astigmatism: As it is already used in US9433346B2, US7427135B2, one can use
features that have high spatial frequencies predominantly in a certain direction as
depicted in Figure 2. So when astigmatism is present, in some orientations it will
be recognized better than in others.

Vision in the dark: The results that were scored at daylight can be compared to
what is scored when the environment is only dimly lit. While e.g. US7427135B2
does utilise a controllable ambient light source in order to check the eye-performance
at various ambient light levels, the natural change in brightness in the room where
the game is played (at home) has to our knowledge never been used to study the
eye in different light-situations before. If ﬁne details can no longer be recognized
it may be due to heavy aberrations with wide open apertures, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 3. If dim features in dark areas of the image, normally detected by the rods
on the retina, can no longer be seen at all, it may be due to nyctalopia. Figure 4
illustrates this condition.

Generally, for each of the above eye conditions one can build symbols that can only be
recognized if the condition is not present. If the child is able to see them, everything
is ok, if it does not or only seldomly see them, there is probably some impairment.
in US6808267B2,
While logging and evaluation of data is widely being used, e.g.
US9433346B2, EyeSpy 20/20, it usually only incorporates to give the results to the
person that is being tested or to transmit the results to a database from where the cus-
tomer or his doctor can download the data. None of these systems offers the ease of use
that a smartphone app included in our idea does. It will allow the parents to monitor
their child’s status as effortlessly as never before. In case of a detected disease, the par-
ents can straightforwardly send the collected data to an ophthalmologist and arrange a
professional examination.

3.3 Advantages of the Idea

One advantage is the passiveness, not letting the child know that it is actually doing a
vision test. This minimizes cooperation problems, and eases parental monitoring. In
addtion, there is the continuity of monitoring that allows for quick identiﬁcation of eye-
sight problems.

The main novelties compared to previous systems are:

Integration into ’real’ video games that are regularly played at home

Integration via mini-games inside the main game

Comfortable smartphone app which allows the parents to monitor their child’s eye
health effortlessly

Test for far-/shortsightedness based on two criteria (angular resolution dependent
on viewing distance; average distance)

Incorporation of ambient light sensor to take into account natural changes in am-
bient light.

3.4 Detectability of the Idea in a Product

In order to allow parents to monitor their children, they have to be made aware of the
fact that the game allows for this. This has to be done publically, so it should not be any
problem to detect, when other products claim the same functionality. The idea may be
included into other products invisibly, too, but without publically claiming so, they will
not have additional monetary beneﬁts, making this consideration irrelevant.

4 Intelligent Adapting Glasses

Authors: Mathias Unberath, Florian Willomitzer, Florian Schiffers, Maike Stöve

4.1 Problem Statement

This idea aims at easing up life for people with progressive sight. Make the need for
visual aid glasses with two different optical refraction powers within the same lens for
people with progressive sight redundant. Give people with seeing glasses and changing
optical refraction power over time the possibility to always have the required adapted
seeing lens (adapted diopters). Even adaptation for two different eyes is possible.

Current state of the art technology does not adjust the optical refraction power of
the lens upon demand in seeing glasses automatically. This system can also be used
in virtual reality glasses as well as augmented reality glasses where users with visual
impairments do not have to wear extra glasses. Additionally, the adaptable lens may
also provide the ability to magnify close objects like a magnifying glass.

4.2 Proposed Method

The idea combines adaptable lenses with the automatic detection of the userŠs line of
sight to adjust the optical refraction power of the lens accordingly. The focus depth is
determined automatically. This way, the subject carrying the glasses will always have
the required seeing aid for any situation.

The glasses incorporate adaptive lenses which are combined with cameras and LEDs
in the glasses mount or the lenses itself to track the exact position of the eye’s sight.
Additionally, there is a distance measurement unit to measure the distance of the eye to
the object. Depending on the determined eye position and the distance of line of sight
to the object the correct optical refraction power of the lens is set. The user will not
require any interaction. The adaptive lenses can be achieved by existing technologies
such as liquid crystal lenses.
In order to achieve the adjustment electrical power is
required. The power supply can either be done by attached batteries or remote power
supply techniques to the glass mount.

Possible suggested technical implementations for the self adapting lenses:

Liquid chrystal lenses

Variable focus lenses by mechanical pressure

Piezo chrystals

•

•

4.3 Advantages of the Idea

The focal length can be adjusted continuously for far and short sighted. The operating
point can be changed in case of vision strengths changes of the subject. The adjustment
process can be done fully automatically. Optionally there is no user interaction required.

5.1 Problem Statement

A medical doctor has to be informed about the state of the art methods in his respective
ﬁeld. It is time consuming to keep up with the literature for a practicing doctor. As
he already is under time pressure in treating his patients, a detailed search for relevant
publications and the following evaluation of the results is often not possible during a
regular working day without investing a disproportional amount of time and energy .

Additionally, a doctor might need a second opinion, suggestion or practical value on

the diagnosis and treatment of complicated or especially rare diseases.

At the moment, this problems are tackled by m3medical.com, a medical platform pro-
viding articles, blogs, news and a doctor forum. As the forum is open for physicians of
all specializations, there are not many topics dealing with opthalmology and the com-
munity for opthalmology is rather small. Therefore it is hard to search for a special
case within the forum and the chance to ﬁnd valuable information is low. More impor-
tantly, using the interface of a conventional internet forum as provided by m3medical
is unnecessarily inconvenient. Still it takes a lot of time to type a question or browse
for an answer. The same applies to the search for scientiﬁc papers and for reading the
newsletter. There is also a local restriction of the use of this platform, as a computer and
internet conection is mandatory.

Furthermore, it is important that a doctor, who observes an unusual or unexpected
progression or manifestation of a disease, is publishing his knowledge. At the moment,
publishing such a case is equivalent to writing an article, ﬁnding the right journal for
publication and being accepted after a time- and energy-consuming review process. This
approach is often keeping doctors away from publishing.

5.2 Proposed Method

The platform covers two main functionalities. On one hand it has a forum for the inter-
action between opthalmologists, on the other hand it it has a scientiﬁc part containing
publications and an easy format for publishing new insights. The forum consists of an
easy to understand template to annotate and upload pictures and/or text and/or speech
recordings, which will be transcribed automatically by speech recognition software.
Coupling the platform and the clinicians network allows to directly upload a picture
after a patients visit. A visual and possibly auditive notiﬁcation will indicate new com-
ments to a forum contribution.

The scientiﬁc part will provide the user with a regular newsletters, e.g. daily, weekly
or monthly. Every user can specify ﬁelds of interest and key words. Based on that, a
summary of relevant publications will be presented in the newsletter. Additionally, a
easy rating system, e.g. "very exciting", "interesting" or "not relevant" can be used to
train the platform for the user and adjust the newsletter keywords. The newsletter can
be provided in a written, oral or even audiovisual format. Furthermore. the scientiﬁc
part contains a search function to browse for publications. An intuitive and easy to use

Seminar Innovation Management

FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, Sony Intellectual Property Europe

19

template will enable the doctor to publish newly gained knowledge without undergoing
a time consuming review process. To control the quality of forum contributions and
publications, a rating system like proposed above should be used.

The platform could be ﬁnanced by a monthly fee. To motivate opthalmologists for
further training, they should be rewarded. Possible types of rewarding are for example:

Discounts for monthly fee

CME points

•

•

Actions that should be rewarded are for example a highly rated publication or forum
contribution. Opthalmologists could also get the opportunity to be rewarded for reading
the newsletter for example by optionally doing a short test.

To guarantee, that the platform can be usedvery fast, easy and almost everywhere, it
will be compatible to all kinds of mobile devices like smartphones and smartwatches.
Additionally, a smartphone can be connected to additional devices and objects like cars,
TVs or the radio. Especially mobile devices will have a very simple interface based on
speech recognition for posting in the forum. All mobile devices, and devices or objects
equipped with speakers will enable the user to listen to the oral format of the newsletter,
enabeling him to listen to it in otherwise not actively used gaps of his daily schedule
like on the way to work or while doing sports.

The system can be connected to the doctors schedule. This provides the additional
possibility to actively ask the user if he wants to listen to the newsletter or wants to
submit a new forum contribution. By using machine learning algorithms the system can
be trained on the user and adapt to his special needs. For example, the system can learn
that a user does not want to listen to the newsletter while driving but likes to listen to it
when he is doing sports

5.3 Advantages of the Idea

The proposed solution provides major advantages over existing systems. Due to the use
of speech recognition, the oral newsletter and the compatibility to many smart devices
and objects, the proposed solution can be used very quickly and intuitively. In addition,
it can be used almost everywhere. This enables opthalmologists to stay informed about
the state of the art in their respective ﬁelds during everyday tasks like driving to work
or doing sports. The rewarding system will be an additional source of motivation for
opthalmologysts to upgrade their education and contribute to the community.

5.4 Detectability of the Idea in a Product

The detection of the speech recognition interface and the compatibility to all kinds of
mobile devices is obvious.

6 Medical Crowd Segmentation

Authors: Florian Schiffers, Maike Stöve, Jonas Hajek

6.1 Problem Statement

To obtain features out of different imaging techniques for further processing, regions of
interests are required. For example the shape of the eye vessel in a fundus image can
be provided by a mask image. Whereas computational algorithms still are inaccurate in
distinguishing vessel- and other tissue pixels, humans have proved to perform very well
on this task.

On the way to completely automate segmentation tasks, promising possibilities like
Deep-Learning approaches require a huge amount of Ground-Truth segmentations. Be-
sides employing people to do these segmentation a different approach is using crowd-
sourcing. The main goal of crowdsourcing is to split the work and assign it online to vol-
unteers, who will be paid for their contribution. Usually a company (e.g. Amazon with
the platform Mechanical Turk) acts as an agent and also charges fees for their services.
Considering huge amount of data the main focus is to minimize the cost per segmen-
tation, therefor the described opportunities may be suboptimal. This patent describes
an interface for obtaining vessel segmentations, which is cheaper and more independent
compared to using permanent employment or external crowdsourcing solutions.

6.2 Proposed Method

The proposed interface is a tablet application which focuses on a speciﬁc target group of
people who enjoy drawing. The idea of the idea is based on adult drawing color books,
where adults receive stress reduction due to drawing out printed shapes. Considering the
Amazon bestseller list there is a high demand for drawing color books. This trend has
also reached the digital ﬁeld, recognizable by high download numbers for similar digital
applications. For example the Android Application ¸SAdult Coloring Book Premium ˇT
has over 1 million downloads on Google Play Store. It seems reasonable to suppose,
that this target group can feel the same stress releasing effect by drawing out image data
for segmentation purpose. Because of this positive effect the users may enjoy the task
itself and are satisﬁed with less money for their contribution. Therefor we introduce a
user interface for an application which has the following features:

Connection to database to transfer medical image data

Painting and erasing function in different brush sizes implemented as a new layer
over the image

Possibility to draw with ﬁnger or digitizer

Guidance for ﬁrst use to explain the user the segmentation task

Zoom function to enable accurate work

section

Training / scoring system: The user has to create a certain amount of segmen-
tations before his data will contribute to the output result. For the training data
we use ground truth segmentations from physician to compare and evaluate the
produced segmentations (e.g. by calculating the mean-square error). The user re-
ceives visual feedback of his work by overlaying and highlighting the difference
images of the segmentations. Based on his average results a score is assigned to
this user in the database. Depending on the amount of available data, many users
have to segment the same images and the corresponding output segmentation is
calculated by the highest overlap of all segmentations. Users who perform better
on the training set will have higher scores and their work is weighted higher for
the output segmentation.

Control system: To ensure high quality after a random number of segmented im-
ages the user works again on a Ground-Truth image and his score and feedback is
updated.

Reward system: The user gets money for every accepted segmentation on his
account and can get payed out by a suitable payment system. Additional there are
prices or bonus payments for users with a very high score.

•

Information about the clinical use of the segmentation, to enhance the awareness
of the user about the medical issue and the value of his work

The administration of the image and user database can be managed by a web front-end
or mobile application. An easy drag and drop upload function of image data enables the
upload to physicians. Therefor the user database distinguishes between administrators,
image data contributors and users. The idea can be used for segmentation of different
medical image data and is not limited to eye images.

6.3 Advantages of the Idea

Cheaper because of omitting third party companies by direct cooperation with the
target group and therefor also gaining independence over transferred and stored
data.

High quality results by test section and quality control system during workﬂow.

Many contributors by referring to drawing application and stress releasing.

7 Personalized 3D Model of the Human Eye

Authors: Temitope Paul Onanuga, Mathias Unberath, Florian Doetzer, Jonas Hajek

7.1 Problem Statement

The problem solved by the idea is the use of fundus imaging in addition to 3D models
of the human eye to create a personalized 3D eye model.

The state of the art is arbitrary 3D models of the human eye. Such models are created
using 3D rendering software such as Blender. These models are commonly used for
medical doctor training purposes and inclusion in game characters. There are currently
no customer available products that make use of personalized eye 3D models.

7.2 Proposed Method

Personalized 3D model of the eye consists of a spherical 3D model of the eye, fundus
images of the inner eye, and a high resolution image of the outer part of the eye. Recent
technology of eye imaging such as D-eye and Peek vision allows taking good quality
fundus images with a smartphone camera. Smartphones also usually have good cameras
that can produce high quality image of the outer eye. Though this image of the outer
eye is intrinsically in 2 dimensions, stereo vision based techniques, e.g taking images
of the eye from different positions, or projecting a pattern from the smartphone into the
eye, can be used to derive a 3D view of the eye. Similar approach is used by Microsoft
MobileFusion application.

These images are then merged together with the 3D eye model to form a personal-
ized 3D representation of the eye. For a more detailed model, fundus images may be
combined with OCT images.

Personalized eye models would be offered as a software that allows users to see the
whole eye at different perspectives and zoom levels. In addition, these eye models could
be 3D printed as a piece of art or included in cartoon ﬁgures for children. The kid would
be excited to have his favorite character using his own eye.

7.3 Advantages of the Idea

•

•

•

Artistic appeal of the personalized 3D eye model

Creation of products based on personalized 3D eye model

This would also subtly encourage people to observe/take eye examinations more
frequently, not only when symptoms appear.

7.4 Detectability of the Idea in a Product

If a product includes such personalized 3D models then it combines fundus images with
a 3D model of the eye.

8 Photoacoustic Contact Lens

Authors: Mathias Unberath, Christian Heidorn, Florian Schiffers, Felix Häußler

8.1 Problem Statement

The basic idea is to create a contact lens which is able to create/help creating medical
images of the eye (perhaps like fundus images or photoacoustic images to measure
glucose in blood) to get fast diagnosis during daily grind.

There is a patent of a photoacoustic measurement of the analyte concentration of
the eyeball (source: https://www.google.ch/patents/US20080033262?hl=de) but there
are no patents of smart lenses which can make diagnosis or images of the eye. The
advantage would be that persons do not have to spend time at a physician. Also changes
or abnormalities of the retinal region can be better detected, because the smart lens
would be able to give information about the inner eye all the time.

8.2 Proposed Method

The lens should have its own power supply. This could be realized with small piezo
elements or NFC, which are attached onto the lens to generate energy. Another way
could be a coil which is loaded through induction from a smart watch.

An Integrated ultrasonic transducer (in example a capacitive micromachined ultra-
sonic transducer, CMUT) is attached on the lense. The transducer can work as a trans-
mitter. If an AC signal is applied, the vibrating membrane will produce ultrasonic waves
to detect blood ﬂow in vessels of the retina. We also can measure the vessel-thickness
and see if stenosis exist (see Figure 6).

Figure 6: Illustration of how the vessel thickness is detected with a transducer. The Transducer
turns the electrical energy into ultrasonic pulses. The Transducer measures the time difference
between the sent out pulse and the incoming resulting pulses. The results can be sent to a
smart watch.

FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, Sony Intellectual Property Europe

Another option, that is possible, is to create second harmonic generation images. The
transducer could also work as a detector (see Figure below). In that case the idea would
be to create short laserpulses, so tissue/blood vessels of the retina are heated up. The
small ultrasonic waves which are produced could be measured with the transducer.

24

Figure 7: Proposed Photoacoustic contact lens

8.3 Advantages of the Idea

The eye could be monitored during daily grind without going to the doctor. The ul-
trasonic measures allow to gain information about the blood cells in the retinal region.
Also, glucose measurements, and measurements, if stenosis occurs, are possible. The
results can be sent to a smart watch and can be provided for telemedicine, which makes
instant diagnosis possible.

9 Power Supply Smart Contact Lens

Authors: Mathias Unberath, Christian Heidorn, Florian Schiffers, Felix Häußler

9.1 Problem Statement

This is an idea for power supply a smart contact lenses which could be used in real
world or for virtual reality applications. To in example make videos with a cam which
is integrated onto the lens one need power supply. Patents for Smart lenses exists (i.e.
https://www.google.ch/patents/US20150281411) but there is no method for generating
the power mentioned.

9.2 Proposed Method

The idea is to generate energy with a piezo element. Through mechanical stress of
blinking the eye the energy could be produced and perhaps stored. A piezoelement
in form of a strip is attached to the surface of the lens. Through blinking the surface
of the eyeball is deformed and therefore the lens is slightly compressed. If the lens is
compressed a kind of a small twich on the piezo element will be introduced. Through
the piezoelectric effect a small electric current is induced

9.3 Advantages of the Idea

The smart lens could act autonomous. No need for a second device. It creates energy
by itself.

9.4 Detectability of the Idea in a Product

There has to be some experiments done. For example it is not known how a lens is com-
pressed during blinking. It is also not known if the piezo element can create sufﬁcient
energy so it acts as a useful power supply.

11 Head Mount for Fundus Imaging

Authors: Tobias Geimer, Mathias Unberath, Johannes Wendel, Christian Heidorn, Flo-
rian Willomitzer, Gerd Häusler

11.1 Problem Statement

Detection of eye deceases is up to the patient to visit a specialized eye doctor on his
own accord. Wide-spread screening for eye deceases is currently infeasible as visual
impairment is usually not on the check-up list for a general physician. The reason
for this is two-fold: First ophthalmic equipment is rather expensive as well as space-
consuming for a general practitioner. Second a certain amount of special knowledge is
needed to perform ophthalmic imaging with e.g. modalities such as Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT) and Fundus imaging.

In order to enable a visual check-up during a regular visit at the general practice, a
compact easy-to-use imaging device is needed, that provides ophthalmic images that
can be used for disease classiﬁcation and early detection without specialized knowledge
by the operating general practitioner.

Disadvantages of the state of the art: Current solutions use smartphone LED, there-
fore, the fundus imaging devices are speciﬁc for a particular brand of smartphone light
sources. The different lightsource of every smartphone causing potential incompatibili-
ties.

11.2 Proposed Method

Setup:

•

•

•

Head-mount or standing mount with head rest

Included light source (infrared-light) and corresponding guiding optics

Adjustable mount for smartphones that allows to adapt the position of the camera
to ﬁt every smartphone make

Connection to synchronize smartphone and mount

•
The proposed device is a goggle-like encasement similar to existing Virtual Reality
(VR) goggles. This could either be used as a low-budget case for smartphone as the
imaging device or serve as an active device itself featuring fundus imaging and OCT.
Alternatively, a GoPro might be used as the imaging device replacing the smartphone.
In conventional systems, the patient is asked to put his chin on a chin rest to ﬁxate
the head with respect to the camera. Our approach solves this problem by attaching
the imaging system (within the goggle) to the patients head, thus, connecting them in
a common rigid system, where the positions of the eye and the system do not change
relative to each other.

The device uses an infrared light source for the alignment. It has a movable plate
which the smartphone is attached to. The smartphone’s sensors should be able to detect
infrared light. It could be possible to detect the infrared light with the arbitrary detector

of the camera. However, common CCD chips feature an infrared ﬁlter blocking of
wavelengths above 700nm. For infrared acquisition to be possible the infrared ﬁlter
needs to be removable. For positioning, it is important that the camera is directly in
front of the eye with a small distance. So the smartphone should be ﬁxated inside the
system with a band or movable clamps, much akin to a smartphone holder for bicycles.
Alignment is achieved via the communication of the smartphone and a motor unit which
is used to control the plate. The smartphone takes infrared images of the eye and retina
to control the position. An infrared light source will have to be mounted alongside the
smartphone to provide illumination. As a result, features like pupil edge and the vessels
of the retina can be detected without causing the pupil to close under the inﬂuence of
the light source. The communication between the smartphone, providing the control
images, and the motor unit of the plate ,controlling the position in x/y direction and the
angle, can take place via wireless connection. After the ordered position is reached, a
signal is sent to the smartphone to take the next picture until an alignment criterion is

reached. An acoustic signal is given that the procedure is ﬁnished.

On implementation side, processing can be done by a third unit housed in the casing.
It takes images from the camera, compares them, sends a movement command to the
motor unit, receives a signal, showing that the position is reached, and returns a signal
to the camera to acquire a new image. Alternatively, the process can be controlled by a
smartphone app omitting the third processing component.

After the alignment process the fundus image is taken. For that there are two possible
options for the device setup. The device comes with an integrated light source and beam
path, such that the smartphone is only used as a camera. This enables a more robust
construction of the illumination pathway and a more ﬂexible mount for the smartphone,
that allows the use of virtually any smartphone available on the market. For that the
device has two light sources. One with infrared light for the alignment. The other light
source includes wavelengths of the visible spectra, with an optional ﬁlter (540-570nm)
to ﬁlter out red wavelengths of light (for better contrast of the blood vessels). If the
smartphone is not capable of focusing, for example, to account the patient’s refractive
error, there is a second option. In front of the Smartphone is an adjustable unit which
exploits the cameras autofocus capability. On the principle of direct ophthalmoscopy
this unit shifts the focus of the smartphone. The unit has also a ﬁlter or a beam splitter
to use the camera’s ﬂash. However, it needs to ﬁlter out speciﬁc wavelengths to take the
best image possible and to reduce the brightness.

During the acquisition process the patient is presented a focus point to ﬁx his gaze
onto. The image is acquired automatically, when alignment is achieved, and illumina-
tion is sufﬁcient. Infrared light can be also used for alignment in order to prevent the
pupil from closing. The infrared image will serve as the basis for the alignment. Only
after the criteria are met, the actual RGB image will be triggered. This is done with the

smartphone camera.

The acquisition process involves minimal specialized knowledge by the general prac-
titioner. The device is placed on the patient’s head and the process is started via a User
Interface on, either an off the shelf desktop PC, or a portable device. After the image
is acquired, the doctor can decide to accept it, or to recapture the image. This way, a
feedback loop is implemented to check the image quality before the diagnostic image is
stored to a data base. Furthermore, this opens up possibilities for telemedicine applica-
tions. In this case a potential nurse/layman could position the device, while an expert is
actually controls the device and choosing the images from a distance.

Having a screening device of this kind available allows many general practices to
acquire many highly comparable images, thus, enabling big data approaches for dis-
ease classiﬁcation. This would increase the early detection rate of common ophthalmic
afﬂictions.

11.3 Advantages of the Idea

Head and imaging system form a common system by attaching the goggle rigidly
to the head.

The goggle is cheaper than a full-blown specialized ophthalmic diagnosis set up.

Easy to use semiautomatic process requires minimal specialized ophthalmic knowl-
edge.

Availability at the general practice allows wide-spread screening for eye deceases
not limited to eye doctor visits.

Potential for telemedicine application.

Same light source for every smartphone allows easier calibration of the camera

Alignment with infrared light

Flexible solution enabling use of virtually any smartphone

Increased diagnostic image quality due to stabilization of head w.r.t. fundus cam-
era

Robust illumination pathway with potentially increased quality due to ﬁxation

11.4 Detectability of the Idea in a Product

The idea provides a new comparatively low-cost method for wide-spread screening
of eye diseases during check-up at the general practitioner. It consists of both hard-
ware/housing and software (UI, database, App) components. Thus, any competitor
copying the idea is easily identiﬁed.
