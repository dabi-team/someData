High-gradient theories as new essential ingredient for the beyond-Standard-Model
Des(s)ert cuisine: Getting rid of divergences in Feynman graphs, uniﬁed “all-in-one”

Inspiring ourselves by the assumption that the notion of symmetry itself is insuﬃcient to construct
the consistent physics of the Desert (the so-called region of energies beyond the Standard Model) and
some additional insights are needed, we suggests that high-energy theories must take into account
the higher-order variations of ﬁelds. With this in mind we propose the generalization of the concepts
of kinetic energy and free particle. It is shown that the theory founded on such principles reveals
major features of the genuinely high-energy one, ﬁrst of all, it appears to be free from ultra-violet
divergences, even the self-energy loop terms become ﬁnite. Also we discuss other arising interesting
phenomena such as the high-gradient currents and charges, uniﬁed “all-in-one” multi-mass states
and origin of generations, VR symmetry, regularization-without-renormalization of SM, etc.

Nowadays there is no clear theory describing the ﬁeld-
particle habitats of the region of energies between the
electroweak and Planck scales. Many physicists even
name this region the Desert probably supposing that its
nature is rather meager in comparison with its low-energy
(Standard Model) and high-energy (superstring) borders.
The recently known attempts of generalization of SM
are concerned with searches for new groups of symme-
tries and carriers of appropriate interactions. The dream
which is inherent to such searches is the one about the
theory which would be genuinely high-energetical in the
sense, e.g., free from ultraviolet divergences [1]. For in-
stance, the popularity of supersymmetric theories was
arisen principally by their (relatively) good ultraviolet
behaviour. The number of proposed since then symme-
tries and corresponding models is so huge that sometimes
it is hard to understand whether a paper is devoted to
the group theory or to the high-energy physics.

However, it may happen that the notion of symme-
try itself is not enough to understand the physics of the
Desert and some additional, rather physical than mathe-
matical, insights are needed. The ﬁrst insight can appear
if we begin to physically think about the nature of the
Desert. It is almost doubtless that this region is charac-
terized not only by high values of ﬁelds but also by high
rates of their variations in space and time. Therefore, the
ﬁrst assertion we can make is: (i) The higher-order ﬁeld
variations can not be neglected in the Desert. Further,
let us think about the nature of particles, in particular,
about the concept of a free particle (ﬁeld). Indeed, which
entity can be regarded as a free (i.e., non-interacting) par-
ticle in the region with non-trivial rapidly varying polar-
ized vacua and hence with large radiation corrections and
hence with large self-interaction? How can we deﬁne the
system of free ﬁelds in the high-energy regime? Besides,
thinking about the mathematical ways of generalization
of the Standard Model why should they be based on the

1

modifying of interaction (potential) terms only? What
about the generalization of the kinetic energy itself? In
view of the previous assertion we suggest that (ii) The
usual deﬁnition of the free particle becomes insuﬃcient
in the Desert and needs to be modiﬁed, as well as that
(iii) The notion of the kinetic energy should be general-
ized to take into account the phenomena which appear in
the Desert.

So, let us try to materialize these three statements in
local Lagrangians. Let us begin with the generic real
scalar ﬁeld action in d-dimensional ﬂat spacetime

S[φ] =

(φ, ∂φ, ..., ∂(℘)φ, x) ddx,

where ℘ is the order of the highest derivative,
ℵk are some
constants of the dimensionality L(ength)2(k−1) whereas
[φ] = L1−d/2. In fact, the model we begin with belongs
to the class of the higher derivative theories which have a
long history [3] but nevertheless below we will try to take
a new look at them. It is evident that this Lagrangian
satisﬁes with the points (i) and (iii). To demonstrate the
assertion (ii) let us suppose that there are no (external)
interactions that means U = m2φ2/2. Further, assuming
for simplicity that
≪
ℵ℘(∂µ1...µ℘φ)2 we preserve in Eq. (2) only the highest-
derivative term to obtain

of the suggestion (ii) above. From the viewpoint of the
deterministic principle it means that the world-line his-
tory of a particle becomes depending on the initial data
not only of ﬁelds and their ﬁrst derivatives but also of
their higher derivatives that agrees with the assertion (i)
and seems to be true in the highly inhomogeneous and
rapidly varying Desert. The satisfaction with the corre-
spondence principle can also be seen in the Fourier space

where Λ is some characteristic momentum. One can see
that these series converge to the Fourier-image of the
usual Klein-Gordon not only when ℘
1 but also when
k2 and m2
Λ2. Besides, to obtain, e.g., the exponent
k2℘ it should be k > Λ otherwise we would have either
℘ < 1 or alternating series which converge to an oscillat-
ing function. Thus, we see that the usual (℘ = 1)-ﬁeld
theories and models appear to be the low-energy limits of
the high-gradient ones with respect to the characteristic
value.

It is interesting that looking at the Fourier expan-
sions above one can observe that the high-gradient
theories also appear to be the generalization of some
theories which do not have any clear local represen-
for example,
tation in coordinate space. These are,
fractional-derivative theories (if we take noninteger 2℘)
and logarithmic-momenta theories (if we take a ﬁnite
number of terms in the series). In coordinate space the
formers have doubtful (non-local) deﬁnition through in-
tegrals whereas the latters have no local derivative formu-
lation at all because appear when considering dynamical
systems with constraints in the phase space.

Further, at even ℘ there arises the symmetry between
virtual tachyons and real particles. The formers are
known to do not satisfy with causal on-mass-shell re-
quirement and have states with complex mass. The num-
ber of the real-virtual partners (including “antiparticles”
m) is determined in fact by zeros of left-hand side

in low-energy regime (like supersymmetry) or does not
exist in Nature at all. It seems that the latter is more
probable because, e.g., the ℘-generalized propagator for
boson ﬁelds has non-removable singularities at even ℘,
as will be shown below. Be that as it may, fermionic
ﬁelds do not have the VR symmetry: in the Fermi case
we have, to a highest-order gradient,

Noether theorem. The important step we proceed now
is the formulation of the notion of conserved current
which is crucial both for creating the high-gradient mod-
els with speciﬁc symmetries and for functional-integral
quantization of high-gradient theories [4]. We demon-
strate the Noether theorem for the high-gradient scalar
ﬁeld but the generalization for ﬁelds with more space-
time or internal indices is trivial. So, let us suppose that
the action (1) is invariant under the group of transfor-
mations x′µ = xµ + δxµ, φ′(x) = φ(x) + δφ(x), where the
variations are characterized by the inﬁnitesimal parame-
ter(s) δωµ: δxµ = X µ

and we are working in the standard approximation to the
order O(δx2). Let us give the ﬁnal result: provided the

and it is doubtless that the appearance of high-gradient
currents for any given symmetry is inevitable in Desert.
Once we have the notion of the
conserved current we can quantize the theory using
Schwinger’s currents formulation and functional integral
methods [5]. Let us begin with the ℘-Klein-Gordon equa-

in principle one particle degree of freedom can have sev-

℘ mass states which will be therefore
named as the uniﬁed “all-in-one” multi-mass states. It
is interesting phenomenon and perhaps it can be the nat-
ural explanation of such mysteries as the origin of masses
and the existence of several generations of the particles
(as well as oscillations between them) which have very
similar characteristics (charge, spin, etc.) but sharply
diﬀerent values of masses. At least, it explanates why
the maximal number of fermionic generations is an odd
number. The maximally possible number of generations
is determined by that of the fermionic ℘-Feynmann prop-
agator’s poles (fully non-degenerate case), therefore, the
more we deepen into the Desert the bigger are ℘’s and
hence the number of generations. One may object that
the fermionic propagator in SM has only one pole whereas
the number of generations is three. However, it should
not be forgotten that SM is inﬁnite in ultraviolet domain
hence incomplete [1], therefore, it “describes” rather than
“explanates” the existing symmetries and generations.
This at least means that SM should be updated in its
highest-energy scale margin to take into account high-
gradient corrections, see the program-minimum below.

However the most striking beneﬁt we have obtained is
the absolute power over the divergences. Returning to

3

Eq. (15) we see that ℘-Feynman propagators converge
for ℘ > d/2 (bosons) and ℘ > d (fermions). In fact, it
is the consequence of the fact that high-gradient theories
properly take into account high-energy corrections.
It
immediately means that all the integrals of the theory,
including the self-energy loops, have good (or, at least,
controlled) ultra-violet behavior because they are given
as the products of propagators

in dependence on the topology of a concrete diagram.
It should be noted that N -supersymmetry-based models
have much less well-deﬁned ultraviolet behaviour in the
most realistic case N = 1 besides there exists the problem
of superpartners. Besides, the self-energy loops ∆(℘)
F (0)
become ﬁnite but, unlike N = 1 rigid supersymmetry
theories, not necessary zero and hence can be regarded
as the fundamental charasteristics of vacuum hence of
the Nature.

Symmetry. Any concrete model within the frameworks
of a given theory can be constructed founding on a par-
ticular group of symmetry. Even if high-gradient and
ordinary models have the same symmetry their prop-
erties (ﬁrst of all, currents and charges) in the general
case ℘
1 are diﬀerent due to appearance of the high-
gradient currents (however, it does not mean yet that the
conservation law of, e.g., electrical charge breaks in high-
gradient theories: simply the deﬁnition of a charge should
be updated to include high-gradient corrections). There-
fore, when trying to construct the consistent beyond-
SM physics it is necessary to understand which sym-
metry survives in the Desert. Generally speaking, there
we can encounter the fact that many habitual gauge or
even global and discrete symmetries (such as CP T ) be-
come approximate. On the other hand, there can ap-
pear a number of explicit and hidden symmetries which
are inherent to high-derivative systems [7] including the
high-derivative supersymmetries [8] (with the known sim-
pliﬁcations caused by nature of Grassmanian variables)
and Riemann-Weyl-Cartan ones (in the vicinity of the
high-energy border of the Desert where spacetime can-
not be supposed ﬂat or even locally ﬂat). All these
circumstances can suﬃciently complicate the construct-
ing of physical models but nobody asserts that trips
across deserts are easy. Besides, it should be remem-
bered that we have the large advantage of possessing the
well-deﬁned ﬁnite perturbation theory, therefore, high-
gradient models are calculable hence veriﬁable indepen-
dently of whether they are “renormalizable” or no.

Further, let us demonstrate the two viewpoints con-
cerning ways of the heuristic constructing of desert mod-
els illustrating them on the simple d-dimensional exam-
ple, quantum electrodynamics (which, however, should
be regarded just as a toy illustration rather than realistic
extrapolation because SM contains QED only as a part
of the underlying non-Abelian theory):

ℵLF ,
where D(℘)
is some constant of
the dimensionality L2(℘−1), and [ψ] = L(℘−d)/2, [Aµ] =
L2−℘−d/2. One can see that the D(℘)-term preserves the
global U (1) symmetry but explicitly breaks the gauge
one. Then the ﬁrst viewpoint tells the following: such
a gauge symmetry does survive in the Desert and hence
additional terms should be inserted in the Lagrangian to
restore it that can easily be done. The previous deﬁni-
tions of currents and charges are only approximate, in
high-energy regime they should be replaced with the ℘-
generalized ones. Unlike the ﬁrst point of view the second
one asserts that: (a) this symmetry eventually dies in the
Desert, (b) this Lagrangian satisﬁes with the correspon-
dence principle, therefore, it can be considered “as is”,
and hence the main questions are where it goes, what
are its symmetries, conserved values, etc. Of course, the
represented opposite views are quite radical, and it is
clear that the correct way should lay somewhere between
them.

Program-minimum. All the above-mentioned recipes
of the consistent constructing of the Desert ﬁeld theory
give in aggregate the program-maximum.
It is neces-
sary also to outline the minimal or “regularization with-
out renormalization” program which is applicable in the
lower-bound margin of the Desert and less painful be-
cause it can be applied to the Standard Model in the
present form without the full ℘-generalization of matter
(fermionic) or gauge ﬁelds. Let us recall the set of SM
particles: (i) gauge bosons W ±, Z, A which are expressed
as superposition of SU (2) gauge triplet W a and U (1) ﬁeld
B, (ii) fermions: three generations of leptons and quarks,
(iii) eight gluons Ga
µ, (iv) Higgs doublet, (v) Faddeev-
Popov ghosts (unphysical scalar particles with the Fermi-
Dirac statistics which were introduced to preserve unitar-
ity [9]): eight gluon’s ones and four ghosts of the gauge
bosons. The ghosts are of special interest now, see also
ref. [10]. Due to their unphysical properties they can ap-
pear only as internal lines of diagrams and play the role
of auxiliary particles. Therefore, the program-minimum
suggests the following:
if input-output particles (exter-
nal lines of Feynman graphs) have energies comparable
with the SM scale it is enough to ℘-generalize only the
internal-line particles in such a way that the Standard
Model would become ﬁnite without UV cutoﬀ, see [11]
and references therein.

The ﬁnal question we mention now is the one about
the concrete value of ℘. The most plausible way would
be to declare ℘ as an auxiliary ﬁeld and to minimize ac-
tion with respect to it. Unfortunately, nobody knows

4

how to variate the derivative order (here we are not con-
sidering the tricks such as transition to the Fourier space
where theory becomes deﬁned even for non-integer ℘ [6])
so the tentative recipe is to conduct calculations assum-
ing ℘ as general as possible, and then in ﬁnal expressions
to choose the value either by involving theoretical con-
siderations such as minimization of energies, preserving
of fundamental symmetries, etc., or directly comparing
with experimental data.

[1] It is indeed a crucial property because the theory which
is merely renormalizible is always incomplete in the sense
needs for the parameters which do not follow from it (and
are taken from, e.g., experimental data) because it cannot
theoretically explain (predict) their values.

[6] We are emphasizing on the word “below” because,
strictly speaking, recently also there is no sure (supported
experimentally) theory of the very low-energy particle
physics with energies less than 1 eV, and one may recall
that SM has also the problem of infra-red divergences.
In this connection the generalized propagator above ad-
mits the continuation on the whole axis (or even complex
plane) of ℘’s, and thus can work not only “beyond” but
also “before” SM even if there is no formalism in terms
of local values in coordinate space.
