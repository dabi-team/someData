Abstract—In this paper, we study the optimal wireless stream-
ing of a multi-quality tiled 360 virtual reality (VR) video from
a multi-antenna server to multiple single-antenna users in a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency di-
vision multiple access (OFDMA) system. In the scenario without
user transcoding, we jointly optimize beamforming and subcar-
rier, transmission power, and rate allocation to minimize the total
transmission power. This problem is a challenging mixed discrete-
continuous optimization problem. We obtain a globally optimal
solution for small multicast groups, an asymptotically optimal
solution for a large antenna array, and a suboptimal solution
for the general case. In the scenario with user transcoding, we
jointly optimize the quality level selection, beamforming, and
subcarrier, transmission power, and rate allocation to minimize
the weighted sum of the average total transmission power and
the transcoding power. This problem is a two-timescale mixed
discrete-continuous optimization problem, which is even more
challenging than the problem for the scenario without user
transcoding. We obtain a globally optimal solution for small
multicast groups, an asymptotically optimal solution for a large
antenna array, and a low-complexity suboptimal solution for
the general case. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the
signiﬁcant gains of proposed solutions over the existing solutions.

I. INTRODUCTION

A 360 virtual reality (VR) video can be generated by cap-

turing a scene of interest in all directions simultaneously
with an omnidirectional camera [2]. It is predicted that the VR
market will reach 87.97 billion USD by 2025 [3]. Transmitting
a 360 VR video over wireless networks enables users to
experience immersive environments without geographical or
behavioral restrictions. As a 360 VR video has a much larger
ﬁle size than a traditional video, streaming an entire 360 VR
video brings a heavy burden to wireless networks [4]–[6].
When watching a 360 VR video, a user perceives it from only
one viewing direction at any time, which corresponds to one
part of the 360 VR video, known as ﬁeld-of-view (FoV). The
tiling technique is widely adopted to improve the transmission
efﬁciency for 360 VR videos [7]. Speciﬁcally, a 360 VR
video is divided into smaller rectangular segments of the same

size, known as tiles. Transmitting the set of tiles covering
each predicted FoV can reduce the required communication
resources without reducing the quality of experience [2], [7].
In practice, users may have heterogeneous conditions (e.g.,
channel conditions, display resolutions of devices, etc.). Pre-
encoding each tile into multiple representations with different
quality levels allows bitrate (quality) adaptation according to
a user’s condition. Therefore, wireless streaming of a multi-
quality tiled 360 VR video has received growing interest.

Recently, [8]–[10] study optimal wireless streaming of a
multi-quality tiled 360 VR video in single-user networks.
Speciﬁcally, [8]–[10] optimize the quality level selection [8],
[10] or transmission rate [9] to minimize the total distortion
[8], [9], or total utility [10]. The proposed solutions for
single-user networks in [8]–[10] are not applicable in multi-
user networks, as optimal resource sharing among users with
heterogeneous channel conditions is not considered. In several
VR applications, such as VR gaming, VR military training,
and VR sports [11], [12], a 360 VR video has to be transmitted
to multiple users simultaneously. When a tile is required
by multiple users concurrently, multicast opportunities can
be utilized to improve transmission efﬁciency. In [13]–[19],
the authors study the optimal wireless streaming of a multi-
quality tiled 360 VR video to multiple users by exploiting
multicast opportunities. In particular, in our previous works
[13], [14], we optimize transmission resource allocation to
minimize the average transmission power for given video
quality requirements of all users and optimize the encoding
rate of each tile to maximize the received video quality for a
given transmission power budget. In [15]–[19], the authors
focus on optimizing quality level selection for each tile.
Speciﬁcally, in [15]–[17], the authors maximize the total utility
of all users [15], [16] or minimize the distortion of video
scenes [17], without considering any constraints on quality
variation. Consequently, more multicast opportunities can be
exploited to further improve transmission efﬁciency. Never-
theless, the obtained quality levels of adjacent tiles may vary
signiﬁcantly, leading to poor viewing experiences [15]–[17]. In
[18], the authors impose some constraints on quality variation
while maximizing the total utility of all users to address
this issue. Although the restrictions on quality variation in
[18] can alleviate quality variation in an FoV to a certain
extent, they cannot guarantee quality smoothness and are less
mathematically tractable. In [19], user transcoding is adopted
to ensure that the quality levels of all received tiles in each FoV
are identical when maximizing the total utility of all users.

Despite the fruitful research in the literature, the perfor-

 
 
 
 
 
 
mance of wireless streaming of a tiled 360 VR video is still un-
satisfactory. The results in [13]–[19] are all for single-antenna
servers, which cannot exploit spatial degrees of freedom for
effective resource utilization. The performance of wireless
systems can be improved by deploying multiple antennas at
a server and designing efﬁcient beamformers. Among various
multi-antenna technologies, MIMO-OFDMA is the dominant
air interface for 5G broadband wireless communications, as it
can provide more reliable communications at high speeds. For
instance, in [20]–[22], the authors consider single-group multi-
cast [20] and multi-group multicast [21], [22]. Speciﬁcally, in
[20], the authors consider the optimization of beamforming
and power allocation to maximize the minimum user data
rate. In [21], the authors consider the subcarrier allocation
and power allocation to maximize the sum rate. However,
the solutions proposed in [20], [21] are heuristic and hence
have no performance guarantee. [22] studies the optimization
of beamforming to minimize the total transmission power. A
stationary point of the beamforming design problem is ob-
tained based on successive convex approximation. Note that in
[22], messages on each subcarrier are associated with different
beamforming vectors, resulting in a substantial increase in
the number of variables and the computational complexity for
solving the optimization problem.

This paper considers the optimal wireless streaming of a
multi-quality tiled 360 VR video from one server to multiple
users in a MIMO-OFDMA system in the scenarios without
and with user transcoding. With more advanced physical layer
techniques than those in [13]–[15], [17]–[19], we expect the
stringent requirements for 360 VR video transmission to be
better satisﬁed. Assume that the set of tiles to be transmitted
to each user has been determined and each user’s quality
requirement is given. The main contributions of this paper
are summarized below.

•

In the scenario without user transcoding, we exploit
natural multicast opportunities and formulate the mini-
mization of the total transmission power with respect to
(w.r.t.) beamforming, subcarrier allocation, transmission
power, and rate allocation as a multi-group multicast
problem in the MIMO-OFDMA system. This problem
is a challenging mixed discrete-continuous optimization
problem. We obtain its optimal solutions for two special
cases, namely, the case of small multicast groups (for
different sets of tiles) and the case of a large antenna
array, exploiting decomposition, continuous relaxation,
and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. We also
obtain a suboptimal solution for the general case using
continuous relaxation and difference of convex (DC)
programming. Note that previous works studying multi-
group multicast in MIMO-OFDMA systems do not in-
vestigate special cases in which optimal solutions can be
obtained [21], [22]. Besides, the proposed multi-group
multicast formulation with one beamforming vector for
each subcarrier can achieve the same performance as the
multi-group multicast formulation in [22] which has one
beamforming vector for each user and each subcarrier, but
yields a substantially lower computational complexity for

the general case.
In the scenario with user transcoding, a ﬂexible trade-
off between computation and communications resource
consumptions can be struck via exploiting transcoding-
enabled multicast opportunities. We utilize natural multi-
cast opportunities and transcoding-enabled multicast op-
portunities and minimize the weighted sum of the average
total transmission power and the transcoding power by
optimizing the quality level selection, beamforming, and
subcarrier, transmission power, and rate allocation. This
problem extends the multi-group multicast optimization
in the scenario without user transcoding, and it is a more
challenging two-timescale mixed optimization problem.
For two special cases, we obtain the corresponding op-
timal solutions. For the general case, we obtain a low-
complexity suboptimal solution. Note that the formula-
tions in [21] and [22], which consider only natural mul-
ticast opportunities, cannot provide an effective design in
the scenario with user transcoding.
Finally, numerical results show substantial gains achieved
by the proposed solutions over existing schemes and
demonstrate the advantages of multicast and user
transcoding in wireless streaming of a multi-quality tiled
360 VR video. Furthermore, numerical results illustrate
that the proposed low-complexity optimal solution ob-
tained for a large antenna array can achieve promising
performance when the number of antennas is moderate,
demonstrating its effectiveness.

Note that this work extends our previous results on wireless
streaming of a multi-quality tiled 360 VR video in time
division multiple access (TDMA) systems [13], [18], [19] and
OFDMA systems [14]. The extensions are highly nontrivial
due to the non-convexity w.r.t beamforming vectors. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work providing an
optimization-based design for wireless streaming of a multi-
quality tiled 360 VR video in MIMO-OFDMA systems.

M transmit antennas and each user wears a single-antenna VR
headset. Denote K , {1, . . . , K} as the set of user indices.
When a VR user is interested in one viewing direction of a
360 VR video, the user watches a rectangular FoV of size
Fh × Fv (in rad×rad), the center of which is referred to as
the viewing direction. Besides, a user can freely switch views
when watching a 360 VR video.

Tiling is adopted to improve the transmission efﬁciency of
the 360 VR video [7]. In particular, the 360 VR video is
divided into Uh × Uv rectangular segments of the same size,
referred to as tiles, where Uh and Uv represent the numbers
of segments in each row and column, respectively. Deﬁne
Uh , {1, . . . , Uh} and Uv , {1, . . . , Uv}. The (uh, uv)-th
tile corresponds to the tile in the uh-th row and the uv-th
column, for all uh ∈ Uh and uv ∈ Uv. Considering user
heterogeneity (e.g., channel conditions, display resolutions of
devices, etc.), each tile is pre-encoded into L representations
corresponding to L quality levels using High Efﬁciency Video
Coding (HEVC), as in Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over
HTTP (DASH). Denote L , {1, . . . , L} as the set of quality
levels. For all l ∈ L, the l-th representation of each tile
corresponds to the l-th lowest quality. For ease of exposition,
the encoding rates of the tiles with the
we assume that

same quality level are identical. Let Dl (in bits/s) denote the
encoding rate of the l-th representation of a tile. Note that
D1 < D2 < . . . < DL. We study the system for the duration
of the playback time of multiple groups of pictures (GOPs).2
In this duration, the FoV of each user does not change. Denote
rk ∈ L as the quality level for the FoV of user k ∈ K. Because
of the video coding structure, r , (rk)k
should not change
during the considered time duration.

As in [13], [14], [18], [19], the server collects a user’s
information such as head orientation (tracked by a 3DoF
or 6DoF VR headset) and location (tracked by a 6DoF VR
headset) from the user’s headset via the uplink transmission,
predicts the user’s FoV and determines the set of tiles to
be transmitted to the user.3 Denote Gk as the set of indices
of the tiles that need to be transmitted to user k. Denote
G ,
Gk as the set of indices of the tiles that need
to be sent to all K users. For all S ⊆ K, S 6= ∅, denote

of the tiles that are needed by all users in S and are not needed

by the users in K\S. Then P , {P

|P
forms a partition of G and I , {S|P
6= ∅, S ⊆ K, S 6= ∅}
speciﬁes the user sets corresponding to the partition. Denote
I , |I|. Let Ik , {S|S ⊆ I, k ∈ S}, k ∈ K. The tiles in P
,
S
S ∈ Ik are required by user k. We consider the tiles in each
set jointly rather than separately, to reduce the complexity for
transmission and resource allocation. For all l ∈ L and S ⊆ K,
the encoding (source coding) bits of the l-th representations
of the tiles in P
are “aggregated” into one message indexed
by (S, l), which is transmitted at most once to the users in
S that will utilize it, to improve transmission efﬁciency. For
,l , {k ∈ S|rk = l}. If there
all S ∈ I and l ∈ L, let K
S
,l, the transmission of message (S, l)
is only one user in K
S
corresponds to unicast; and if there are multiple users in K
,l,
S
the transmission of message (S, l) corresponds to multicast.
Thus, the multi-quality tiled 360 VR video transmission to
the K users may involve both unicast and multicast. An
illustration example can be seen in Fig. 1 (b).

Problem 1 (Total Transmission Power Minimization for h):

In Section III, we will consider the scenario where users
cannot perform transcoding but directly play the received
messages. In Section IV, we will consider the scenario where
users can ﬁrst perform transcoding, i.e., convert a tile represen-
tation at a certain quality level to a lower quality level using
transcoding tools such as Fast Forward Mpeg (FFmpeg), and
then play the received video.

observed that Problem 1 is a challenging mixed discrete-

Problem 3 (Subproblem of Problem 2 for h):

Notice that Problem 3 is nonconvex due to the rank-one
constraint in (11), while Problem 2 is a nonconvex problem
because of the binary constraints in (1). Both problems are
pretty challenging. In the following, we solve Problem 3 and
Problem 2 for two special cases.

1) Case of Small Multicast Groups: In this part, we con-
sider the case where for all S ∈ I and l ∈ L
, there are at
S
most three users who need message (S, l) (i.e., |K
,l| ≤ 3).
S
First, we obtain an optimal solution of Problem 3 by applying
semideﬁnite relaxation and rank reduction proposed in [28].
Speciﬁcally, we relax the constraint in (11), and get an SDP,
which is convex and can be solved effectively. Under the
condition that |K
,l| ≤ 3, a rank-one solution can be con-
S
structed based on an optimal solution of the SDP using rank
,l,n(h), S ∈ I, l ∈ L
reduction [28]. Then, substituting Q†
S
S
into Problem 2 and relaxing the constraints in (1) to

µ

,l,n(h) ≥ 0, S ∈ I, l ∈ L
S

S

, n ∈ N ,

(15)

we obtain a relaxed problem of Problem 2, which is convex.
Using the KKT conditions, we know that under a mild condi-
tion, there exists an optimal solution of the relaxed problem of
Problem 2 which provides binary subcarrier assignment [14].

4Note that the goal of solving a nonconvex problem is usually to design an
iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point or a KKT point. In general, it
is impossible to analytically or numerically show the gap between a globally
optimal solution and a suboptimal solution, as a globally optimal solution
cannot be obtained analytically or numerically with effective and efﬁcient

solutions of Problem 2 and Problem 3 with computational
complexity O(N KI). Therefore, the computational complex-

3 and the number of antennas equipped at the server is not
large, we cannot obtain a globally optimal solution of the
nonconvex problem in Problem 3. Thus, we cannot solve
Problem 1 by solving its equivalent form in Problem 2. In
this subsection, we directly tackle Problem 1, and develop a
low-complexity algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution of
Problem 1 using relaxation and DC programming.

First, by relaxing the constraints in (1) of Problem 1 to the
constraints in (15), we can obtain the relaxed continuous prob-
lem of Problem 1. Next, we convert the relaxed continuous
,l,n(h) ,
problem of Problem 1 to DC programming. Let W
,l,n(h)wn(h). Thus, the constraints in (3), (4),
and (6) can be equivalently transformed to the following ones.

6-13, we obtain an optimal solution of Problem 5 based
on the optimal solution of Problem 4 with computational
complexity O(M 5N K 2I); in Steps 14-15, we compute a sub-
optimal solution of Problem 1 based on the optimal solution
of Problem 5 with computational complexity O(M N KI).
Therefore, the computational complexity of Algorithm 2 is
O(M 3K 4N 3.5I 3.5).

IV. AVERAGE TRANSMISSION POWER MINIMIZATION
WITH USER TRANSCODING

In this section, we consider the case with user transcoding.
Although message (S, l), where S ∈ I and l ∈ L, is requested
,l, it may be transmitted to all users in
only by the users in K
S
,l′ for some l′ < l simultaneously via multicast.
,l and K

S
,l directly use message (S, l). In contrast, the
The users in K
S
,l′, l′ < l ﬁrst convert message (S, l) to message
users in K
S
(S, l′) using transcoding, before using it. This type of multicast
opportunities are referred to as transcoding-enabled multicast
opportunities [19]. An illustration example is shown in Fig. 1
(c). In this example, by making use of natural multicast
opportunities, the server multicasts message ({1, 2}, 1) to user
1 and user 2; by making use of transcoding-enabled multicast
opportunities, the server multicasts message ({2, 3}, 2) to user
2 and user 3 and multicasts message ({1, 2, 3}, 2) to user 1,
user 2 and user 3. By comparing Fig. 1 (b) and Fig. 1 (c), we
can see that transcoding provides more multicast opportunities.

To model user transcoding [31], let x , (x
S

,l,k)
denote the quality level selection variables, where

S∈I

,l

∈L

,k

∈S

,l,k ∈ {0, 1}, S ∈ I, l ∈ L, k ∈ S,

Here, x

,l,k = 1 indicates that
S

,l,k = 0 otherwise. Note
S
that the constraints in (32) ensure that the server transmits
only one of the messages (S, l), l ∈ L which has quality level
,l′,k to user k. Note that x should not change during
the considered time duration because of the video coding
P
structure. With transcoding, to ensure that user k can play
his FoV at quality level rk, it is sufﬁcient to require:

l′x
S

∈L

l′

,l,k ≥ rk, S ∈ I, l ∈ L, k ∈ S.

(33)

lx
S

Then, the successful transmission constraints in (6) become:

l

∈L

X

On the other hand, user transcoding also consumes power.
For ease of exposition, we assume that
the transcoding
powers for reducing the quality levels of all tiles by one
are identical at each user. Denote Ek as the transcoding
power at user k for lowering the quality level of the rep-
resentation of a tile by one. Since different users have het-
erogeneous hardware conditions, we allow Ek, k ∈ K to
be different. Then, the total transcoding power at all users
is Etc(x) ,
|Ek. The
l
weighted sum of the average transmission power and the
transcoding power is

Similarly, we treat µ(h), η(h), c(h), w(h) as functions of h,

we would like to minimize the weighted sum of the average
transmission power and the transcoding power under the
constraints in (1)-(4), (5), and (31)-(35), by optimizing µ(h),
η(h), c(h), w(h), and x. Speciﬁcally, for given r, we have

Problem 6 is a variational problem. Besides, it is a two-

in MIMO-OFDMA systems because it allows optimizing
multicast groups to a certain extent via exploiting transcoding-
enabled multicast opportunities. In the following, Problem 6 is
solved using two methods. The ﬁrst method provides optimal
solutions for some special cases, and the second method offers
a suboptimal solution for the general case.

(36)

Thus, we can impose the extra constraints in (36) without loss
of optimality. In two special cases, we solve Problem 6 by
solving the following equivalent problem of Problem 6.

Problem 7 (Equivalent Problem of Problem 6):

3, and Problem 9, we have the following result.

Theorem 3 (Equivalence between Problem 8 and Prob-
lem 9): The optimal values of Problem 8 and Prob-
lem 9 are identical. In addition, ( ˆµ†(h), ˆη†(h), ˆc†(h), ˆw†(h))

6The optimal quality level selection can be used until Gk, k ∈ K change.
For any given Gk, k ∈ K, we only need to solve Problem 6 once and then
solve Problem 8 (which is similar to Problem 1) for each subsequent frame.

9

and then obtain ˆµ†(h), ˆη†(h), and ˆc†(h) by solving Problem
9. In the case where each group S ∈ I has at most 3 users,
i.e., |S| ≤ 3, S ∈ I, we can obtain an optimal solution of
Problem 9 by using Algorithm 1 in Section III-A1. In the case
of a large antenna array, we can get an asymptotically optimal
solution of Problem 9 using the method in Section III-A2.
After obtaining E⋆(x, h) for all x ∈ X and h, we can nu-
merically compute E[E⋆(x, H)], for all x ∈ X , and then solve
Problem 7 using the exhaustive search. The exhaustive search

B. Suboptimal Solution in General Case

In the general case, we directly tackle Problem 6 and
develop a low-complexity algorithm to obtain a suboptimal
solution. Speciﬁcally, we get a suboptimal quality level se-
lection by solving an approximation of Problem 6 using DC
programming and obtain a suboptimal solution of Problem 8
with the obtained x using Algorithm 2 in Section III-B.

First, we get an approximation of Problem 6, which has only
one timescale and has a much smaller number of variables than
Problem 6 [32]. Speciﬁcally, (35) and (34) are replaced by

developed to obtain a suboptimal solution of Problem 11 using

First, we convert Problem 11 to a penalized DC problem.
Speciﬁcally, we equivalently convert the discrete constraints
in (31) to the following continuous constraints:

By augmenting the constraints in (49) to the objective function
via the penalty method [18], Problem 11 can be equivalently
converted to the following problem.

Note that we can regard the objective function of Prob-
lem 12 as a difference of two convex functions and the
constraints of Problem 12 are all convex. Thus, we can view
Problem 12 as a penalized DC problem of Problem 11. When
the feasible set of Problem 11 is nonempty, there exists ρ0 > 0
such that for all ρ > ρ0, Problem 12 and Problem 11 are

10

equivalent [30]. By solving Problem 12 using a DC algorithm
[30], we obtain a stationary point ( ¯P⋄, ¯N⋄, x⋄) of Problem 11.
Next, by substituting x⋄ into Problem 8, we can get

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

This section considers the two scenarios without (w/o)
and with (w) user transcoding, and compares the proposed
solutions in Section III and Section IV with baseline schemes.
In the scenario without user transcoding, we consider the
following two baseline schemes. Baseline 1 serves K users
separately (i.e., adopts unicast) and adopts the normalized
maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamformer for each user
on each subcarrier. Baseline 2 jointly considers the FoVs
of all users (i.e., adopts multicast for a message, if there
exists a multicast opportunity) as in this paper and adopts
the normalized MRT beamformer for a massage on each
subcarrier obtained based on the channel power gain matrix
of all users requiring this message on each subcarrier [33].
Then, for each baseline scheme, the optimal subcarrier, power,
and rate allocation is obtained by solving Problem 2 for the
respective MRT using the method proposed in Section III-A.
In the scenario with user transcoding, we consider one baseline
scheme, i.e., Baseline 3, which transmits message (S, r
,max)
S
,max , maxk
to all users in S using multicast, where r
rk,
S
and uses the optimal subcarrier, power, and rate allocation
and beamforming design as in Section III-B. We evaluate
the average total transmission power in the scenario without
user transcoding and the sum of the average total transmis-
sion power and transcoding power in the scenario with user
transcoding. In the following, both measurement metrics are
referred to as average power for short. We implement the
proposed solutions and baseline schemes using Matlab and
CVX (a Matlab software for disciplined convex programming).
6 W for all
k ∈ K, Fh = Fv = 100◦, Uh × Uv = 30 × 15, B = 39 kHz,
9 W, and α = 1. The elements of Hn,k,
N = 64, n0 = 10−
n ∈ N , k ∈ K, are independent and identically distributed
according to CN (0, 1M
M ). We consider the 3DoF VR video
sequence Venice [34] and use the viewing directions of 30
users for the 15-th frame of this video sequence obtained from
real measurements in [34] as the predicted viewing directions.
To deal with possible prediction errors, an extra 15◦ in the
four directions of the predicted FoV is transmitted for each
user [13], [14]. The 360 VR video encoder named Kvazaar is
adopted. Set L = 5, and choose Dl, l ∈ L as in [18]. For any
Gk, k ∈ K, we evaluate the average power over 100 random
realizations of small-scale channel fading coefﬁcients.

In this simulation, we set βk = 1 and Ek = 10−

Fig. 3. Viewing directions and corresponding FoVs of 5 users [34].

First, we evaluate the average power over 1,000 random
choices for the viewing directions of 1-5 users from 30 users
from [34]. Fig. 2 (a) illustrates the average power versus the
number of users K. Since the proposed optimal solutions for
small multicast groups in the scenarios without and with user
,l| ≤ 3, S ∈ I, l ∈ L
transcoding are valid only for |K
,
S
S
and |S| ≤ 3, S ∈ I, respectively. Therefore, we do not
show their average powers for K > 3 where the above-
mentioned conditions are not satisﬁed. We can observe that
the average powers of the proposed solutions and baseline
schemes increase with K, as the transmission load increases
with K. When K ≤ 3, the proposed solutions for the general
case achieve close-to-optimal powers. Given the unsatisfactory
performance of Baseline 1, we no longer compare with it
in the remaining ﬁgures. Fig. 2 (b) illustrates the average
power versus the number of antennas M . We can observe that
the powers achieved by the proposed solutions and baseline
schemes decrease with M . Also, when M is sufﬁciently large,
the proposed asymptotically optimal solutions reach close-
to-optimal average powers, demonstrating the asymptotically
optimalities of the proposed solutions for the case of a large
antenna array.

Next, we show the impacts of the concentration of the view-
ing directions of all users and the similarity of the required
quality levels of all users. We choose the viewing directions
of 5 users out of 30 users from [34], i.e., (νk, γk)k
,
}
as shown in Fig. 3. To show the impact of the concentration
of the viewing directions of all users, based on the chosen
viewing directions, we consider ﬁve sets of viewing directions,
i.e., (ν1 + ∆, γ1), (ν2 + ∆, γ2), (ν3, γ3), (ν4 − ∆, γ4), and
(ν5 − ∆, γ5), ∆ = 1, . . . , 5, and evaluate the corresponding
average powers. Note that ∆ reﬂects the concentration of the
viewing directions of the 5 users. In particular, the concen-
tration increases with ∆. Fig. 4 (a) shows the average power

1,...,5

∈{

versus the concentration parameter ∆. We can see that each
multicast scheme’s average power decreases with ∆, since
multicast opportunities increase with ∆. To show the impact of
the similarity of the required quality levels, we consider three
sets of required quality levels, i.e., ¯rτ = (min{τ, 3}, min{τ +
1, 3}, 3, max{3, 5 − τ }, max{3, 6 − τ }), τ = 1, 2, 3. Note that
τ indicates the similarity of the required quality levels of the
users. Speciﬁcally, the required quality levels are closer when
τ is larger. Fig. 4 (b) illustrates the average power versus the
similarity parameter τ . We can see that when τ increases,
the average power of each multicast scheme decreases, due
to the rise of natural multicast opportunities. Furthermore,
as τ increases, the gaps between the average powers of the
multicast schemes in the scenario without user transcoding
and those in the scenario with user transcoding decrease, as
transcoding-enabled multicast opportunities decrease.

Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 show that

the proposed solutions in
the scenario with user transcoding outperform those in the
scenario without user transcoding, which demonstrates the im-
portance of using transcoding-enabled multicast opportunities
in reducing power consumption. Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 also show
that the proposed solutions outperform the baseline schemes.
Speciﬁcally, the proposed solutions in the scenario without
user transcoding outperform Baseline 1, as the proposed
solutions utilizing multicast transmission offer higher spectral
efﬁciency. The proposed solutions in the scenario without user
transcoding outperform Baseline 2, as the proposed solutions
carefully choose beamforming vectors. The proposed solutions
in the scenario with user transcoding outperform Baseline 3,
as the proposed solutions in the scenario with user transcoding
optimally exploit transcoding-enabled multicast opportunities
to reduce power consumption.

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper studied the optimal wireless streaming of a multi-
quality tiled 360 VR video to multiple users in a MIMO-
OFDMA system. In the scenario without user transcoding,
we minimized the total transmission power by optimizing
the beamforming, and subcarrier, transmission power and rate
allocation. This is a challenging mixed discrete-continuous
optimization problem. We obtained a globally optimal solution
for small multicast groups, an asymptotically optimal solution

for a large antenna array, and a suboptimal solution for the gen-
eral case. In the scenario with user transcoding, we minimized
the weighted sum of the average total transmission power
and the transcoding power by optimizing the quality level
selection, beamforming, and subcarrier, transmission power,
and rate allocation. This is a more challenging two-timescale
mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. We obtained
a globally optimal solution for small multicast groups, an
asymptotically optimal solution for a large antenna array, and
a low-complexity suboptimal solution for the general case.
Finally, numerical results showed that the proposed solutions
have signiﬁcant gains over existing schemes.

By (59) and (66), we can conclude that the problem in (58)

the problem in (58). Following the proof of Theorem 1 in
[29], we can show that ˜w∗

APPENDIX C: PROOF OF THEOREM 3

First, we show that the optimal value of Problem 10 is no
greater than that of Problem 11, i.e., E†t ≤ ¯E∗t . Based on an
optimal solution of Problem 11, i.e., ( ¯N∗, ¯P∗, x∗), we con-
struct a feasible solution of Problem 10, whose objective value
¯P ∗
is ¯E∗. Speciﬁcally, we construct ¯µ∗
S,l

S
S ∈ I, l ∈ L, n ∈ N . Then, it is obvious that (¯µ∗, ¯p∗, x∗)
satisﬁes the constraints of Problem 10, implying that it is a
feasible solution of Problem 10. Besides, we have

on an optimal solution of Problem 10, i.e., ( ¯µ†, ¯p†, x†), we
construct a feasible solution of Problem 11, whose objective
value is E†t . Speciﬁcally, we construct ¯N †

Finally, we show that the optimal values of Problem 10

and Problem 11 are identical and characterize the relatioship
between their optimal solutions. By (69) and (71), we have
E†t = ¯E∗t . By E†t = ¯E∗t and (69), we know that (¯µ∗, ¯p∗, x∗) is
an optimal solution of Problem 10. By E†t = ¯E∗t and (71), we
know that ( ¯N †, ¯P †, x†) is an optimal solution of Problem 11.
Therefore, the proof of Theorem 3 is completed.
