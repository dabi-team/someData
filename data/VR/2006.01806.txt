ABSTRACT

Observations show that 100-km-class Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) can be di-
vided in (at least) two color groups, hereafter red (R; g − i < 1.2) and very red
(VR; g − i > 1.2), reﬂecting a diﬀerence in their surface composition. This is

 
 
 
 
 
 
– 2 –

thought to imply that KBOs formed over a relatively wide range of radial dis-
tance, r. The cold classicals at 42 < r < 47 au are predominantly VR and known
Neptune Trojans at r (cid:39) 30 au are mostly R. Intriguingly, however, the dynami-
cally hot KBOs show a mix of R and VR colors and no correlation of color with r.
Here we perform migration/instability simulations where the Kuiper belt is pop-
ulated from an extended planetesimal disk. We ﬁnd that the color observations
can be best understood if R objects formed at r < r∗ and VR objects at r > r∗,
with 30 < r∗ < 40 au. The proposed transition at 30 < r∗ < 40 au would explain
why the VR objects in the dynamically hot population have smaller orbital incli-
nations than the R objects, because the orbital excitation from Neptune weakens
for orbits starting beyond 30 au. Possible causes of the R-VR color bimodality
are discussed.

Introduction

The vast majority of KBOs are too faint for spectroscopic observations, but their surface

composition can be studied with broadband photometry. Photometric observations indicate
that the color distribution of KBOs is bimodal1 with red (R; deﬁned as g − i < 1.2 in

Wong & Brown (2017); observations made in the ugriz magnitude system) and very red

(VR; g − i > 1.2) classes (e.g., Luu & Jewitt 1996, 1998; Tegler & Romanishin 1998, 2000;

Jewitt & Luu 1998, 2001; Peixinho et al. 2003, 2008, 2012, 2015; Tegler et al. 2003, 2016;

Barucci et al. 2005; Sheppard 2012; Fraser & Brown 2012; Wong & Brown 2017; Pike et al.

2017; Jewitt 2018; Schwamb et al. 2019, Marsset et al. 2019). Known Neptune Trojans at

radial distance r (cid:39) 30 au are R (Sheppard & Trujillo 2006, Parker et al. 2013, Jewitt 2018),

with one known exception (2013 VX30; Lin et al. 2019), and most classiﬁed cold classicals

1In fact, the color distribution of KBOs is complex and many color subdivisions exist (e.g., Pike et al.
2017). We do not discuss these color sub-groups here because our work does not oﬀer any new insight into
subtle compositional diﬀerences.
In addition, note that diﬀerent terminologies are currently in use. For
example, the VR color, as used here, is often referred to as “ultra-red” (e.g., Sheppard 2012, Peixinho et al.
2015).

– 3 –

(CCs)2 with semimajor axes 42 < a < 47 au are VR. This has been taken as evidence that

colors have something to do with the distance at which diﬀerent objects formed. Confusing

matters, however, the dynamically hot populations with 30 < a < 50 au show a mix of R

and VR colors, and there does not appear to be any obvious correlation of colors with r

(e.g., Peixinho et al. 2015, Marsset et al. 2019).

Brown et al. (2011) proposed that the early surface compositions of KBOs were set

by volatile evaporation after the objects formed. A strong gradient in surface composition,

coupled with UV irradiation and particle impacts, then presumably led to the surface colors

that we see today. For example, the sublimation line of (pure) ammonia, NH3, is near 34 au
(Brown et al. 2011). Objects formed at the current location of CCs may therefore uniquely

retain NH3, which has been shown to aﬀect irradiation chemistry and could plausibly lead
to the VR colors of these objects. But how to interpret the R colors of Neptune Trojans and

the bimodal distribution of colors in the hot population?

Neptune Trojans were presumably trapped as co-orbitals during Neptune’s migration

(e.g., Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2009, Parker 2015, Gomes & Nesvorn´y 2016). Their inferred

formation location is r (cid:39) 25-30 au. The predominantly R colors of Neptune Trojans (Jewitt

2018, Lin et al. 2019) would thus be hard to understand if the R to VR transition is related

the sublimation line of the hydrogen sulﬁde ice (H2S, r (cid:39) 15-20 au), as suggested by Wong
& Brown (2016, 2017). Instead, the R colors of Neptune Trojans seem to imply that the

transition occurred farther out, probably beyond ∼30 au. This reasoning leads to an impasse,

however, because our best dynamical models suggest that the dynamically hot KBOs were

implanted onto their current orbits from the massive planetesimal disk inside of 30 au. Their

colors should thus be uniformly R, just like Neptune Trojans, but they are not.

2Based on their orbits, KBOs can be classiﬁed into several categories: classical Kuiper belt (CKB),
resonant populations, scattered disk objects (SDOs), etc. (Gladman et al. 2008). Most known KBOs reside
in the main CKB, which is located between the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances with Neptune (39.4 < r < 47.8 au).
It is furthermore useful to divide the CKB into dynamically “cold” (CCs; orbital inclinations i < 5◦) and
“hot” components (HCs; i > 5◦), mainly because the inclination distribution in the CKB is bimodal (Brown
2001) and CCs have unique physical properties (e.g., VR colors, Jewitt & Luu 1998, Tegler & Romanishin
2000; large binary fraction, Noll et al. 2020). In this text, the dynamically hot KBO population is deﬁned
an ensemble of HCs, resonant populations and SDOs, whereas the dynamically cold population is the same
as CCs.

2. Color Hypothesis

Here we examine the possibility that the hot populations (i.e., HCs, Plutinos3, SDOs) in

the present-day Kuiper belt are a mix of bodies implanted from the massive disk below 30 au

(source of R) and the low-mass disk extension beyond 30 au (source of VR). On one hand, the

surface density of planetesimals must have been quite low at r > 30 au for Neptune to stop

at 30 au (Gomes et al. 2004, Nesvorn´y 2018). The outer disk extension thus represents a

smaller source reservoir than the massive disk below 30 au. On the other hand, the chances

to evolve from 30-40 au onto a dynamically hot orbit in the Kuiper belt are better (e.g.,

Hahn & Malhotra 2005). It is thus plausible that a good share of hot KBOs come from the
30-40 au region.4

The proposed color transition at r∗ > 30 au could explain why the VR objects in the

dynamically hot population have smaller orbital inclinations than the R objects (e.g., Tegler

& Romanishin 2000; Trujillo & Brown 2002; Hainaut & Delsanti 2002; Peixinho et al. 2008,

2015; Marsset et al. 2019), because the orbital excitation from Neptune is expected to

weaken for orbits starting beyond 30 au. We investigate this issue in detail in Section 4.3. In

contrast, no such correlation would be expected if both the R and VR objects started below

30 au, where Neptune’s gravitational eﬀects are uniformly strong (Nesvorn´y 2015a).

If some of the R objects can be pushed out from r < r∗ into the CC population, this

(2017) and indicate that
could explain the “blue” CC binaries reported in Fraser et al.
r∗ > 35 au. Note that the analysis presented here aims at explaining the global distribution

of KBO colors, including the color-inclination correlation; this is well beyond the scope of

the analysis of blue binaries in Fraser et al. (2017). Our color hypothesis would also be

consistent with the R colors of Jupiter Trojans (Emery et al. 2015) and irregular satellites

of the giant planets (Graykowski & Jewitt 2018), because they are thought to be captured

from the massive disk below 30 au, and thus expected to be R.

3Plutinos in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune are the most populated and best characterized resonant
population. Here we focus on this population. Other resonant populations will be considered in future work.

4Note that planetesimals starting beyond 40 au remain on low inclination orbits during Neptune’s mi-
gration (e.g., Batygin et al. 2011, Nesvorn´y 2015b); the r > 40 au region is therefore not a major source of
dynamically hot KBOs.

– 5 –

Pike et al. (2017) pointed out that cold and hot KBOs with g − r > 0.8 (roughly the

VR category here) have diﬀerent r − z colors (hot VR KBOs exhibit redder r − z colors).

This was used in Schwamb et al. (2019) to propose that the original planetesimal disk had

two color transitions: one at ∼33 au, from VR with redder r − z colors to R (called “neutral”

in Schwamb et al.) and another one at ∼39 au, from R to VR with bluer r − z colors. This

cannot work, however, because: (i) it would not ﬁt the predominantly R colors of Neptune

Trojans (Jewitt 2018, Lin et al. 2019), and (ii) VR objects starting below 33 au would end

up on orbits with higher orbital inclinations than R objects starting at 33-39 au (Section

4.3), which is opposite to what the color observations indicate (e.g., Marsset et al. 2019).

Pike et al.’s result is more likely related to a change of r − z with original orbital radius from
r∗ to the location of CCs at r > 42 au.

3. Methods

The occurrence of R and VR objects in each KBO category can be determined, in

the context of the suggested model, from the initial disk proﬁle (massive at r < 30 au
with decreasing surface density beyond 30 au), the radial distance r∗ which marked the

original transition from R to VR colors, and the implantation probability from r to a speciﬁc

dynamical class. This is the main goal of the work presented here. We aim at identifying
the disk proﬁles and the range of r∗ values that best ﬁt the existing color data.

3.1.

Integration Method

The numerical integrations conducted here consist of tracking the orbits of four giant
planets (Jupiter to Neptune) and a large number of particles (2 × 106) representing the

original trans-Neptunian disk. To set up an integration, Uranus and Neptune are placed

inside of their current orbits and migrated outward. The swift rmvs4 code, part of the

Swift N -body integration package (Levison & Duncan 1994), is used to follow the orbits of

planets and massless disk particles. The code was modiﬁed to include additional forces that

mimic the radial migration and damping of planetary orbits. These forces are parametrized

by the exponential e-folding timescale, τ .

– 6 –

The migration histories of planets are informed by our best models of planetary migra-

tion/instability (Nesvorn´y & Morbidelli 2012, hereafter NM12; also see Deienno et al. 2017).

In the NM12 models, Neptune’s migration can be divided into two stages separated by a

brief episode of dynamical instability (jumping Neptune model, Figure 1). Neptune migrates

on a circular orbit before the instability (Stage 1). Its eccentricity becomes excited during

the instability and is subsequently damped by a gravitational interaction with disk planetes-

imals (Stage 2). The instability is needed, among other things (e.g., orbital eccentricity of

Jupiter, asteroid belt constraints; Nesvorn´y 2018), to explain the Kuiper belt kernel near

44 au (Section 4.2; Petit et al. 2011, Nesvorn´y 2015b, Bannister et al. 2018).

The orbital behavior of Neptune during the ﬁrst and second migration stages can be

approximated by τ1 (cid:39) 5-30 Myr and τ2 (cid:39) 30-100 Myr. We ﬁnd that Neptune’s migration
in a power-law radial disk proﬁle is often too fast (τ1 < 10 Myr) to satisfy the inclination
constraint and it is diﬃcult to ﬁne-tune the total disk mass, Mdisk, to obtain τ1 (cid:38) 10 Myr.
The power-law disks also eﬃciently damp Neptune’s eccentricity during Stage 2, which eﬀects

the ability of Neptune’s resonances to implant bodies on the high-inclination orbits in the

Kuiper belt (Volk & Malhotra 2019). The exponential disks show more promising results

(e.g., τ1 = 12 Myr and τ2 = 27 Myr in Fig. 1). We account for the jitter that Neptune’s orbit
experiences due to close encounters with Pluto-class objects. Neptune’s grainy migration is

important to produce the right proportion of resonant and non-resonant KBOs (Nesvorn´y

& Vokrouhlick´y 2016).

All migration simulations are run to 0.5 Gyr. They are extended to 4.5 Gyr with the

standard swift rmvs4 code (i.e., without migration/damping after 0.5 Gyr). We perform

four new simulations in total (Table 1).

In the ﬁrst case, we adopt τ1 = 10 Myr and
τ2 = 30 Myr as indicated by Fig. 1. This case roughly corresponds to the shortest migration
timescale that is required to satisfy the inclination constraint (Nesvorn´y 2015a; but see

Volk & Malhotra 2019). In the second case, we use longer timescales: τ1 = 30 Myr and
τ2 = 100 Myr. This case would correspond to a slower migration driven by a lower mass
planetesimal disk. A very slow migration of Neptune during the second stage would be

needed, for example, to explain Saturn’s obliquity (Ward & Hamilton 2004, Hamilton &

Ward 2004, Vokrouhlick´y & Nesvorn´y 2015). These two cases bracket the interesting range

– 7 –

of possibilities. We perform two simulations5 in each case, one with Neptune’s jump at the

transition from Stages 1 to 2 (Nesvorn´y 2015b) and one without it. The jump is implemented

as an instantaneous increase of Neptune’s semimajor axis by 0.4-0.5 au (Table 1). In the

following text, the simulations without jump are labeled s10/30 and s30/100; the ones with

jump are s10/30j and s30/100j.

The ﬁnal orbits of Uranus and Neptune are ﬁne-tuned in these simulations such as the

period ratio PN/PU = 1.92-1.95, where PU and PN are the orbital periods of Uranus and
Neptune (Table 1). The orbital ratio of the real planets in the current Solar System is

PN/PU = 1.96. We opt for having model PN/PU a tiny bit smaller than 1.96 to make sure
that Uranus and Neptune are never too close to the 2:1 resonance (the eﬀects of the 2:1

resonance can disrupt the Kuiper belt structure, change stability of resonant populations,

etc.). We also make sure that the ﬁnal semimajor axes, eccentricities and inclinations of

planets are as close to the real values as possible. Neptune’s orbital eccentricity is assumed

to increase to eN = 0.1 at the transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2, at often seen in our
self-consistent instability simulations (Fig. 1). The damping routines are tuned such that

the simulated orbit of Neptune ends with just the right orbital inclination and eccentricity

(current mean eN = 0.009). The cases with larger ﬁnal eN, such as the ones described as
Case A in Volk & Malhotra (2019), are not investigated here.

3.2. Planetesimal Disk

Previous studies of planetary migration/instability often adopted a two-part disk struc-

ture with a massive planetesimal disk on the inside, a low-mass disk on the outside, and

a sharp transition from high to low surface densities near 30 au. The inner part of the

planetesimal disk, from just outside Neptune’s initial orbit to ∼30 au, was estimated mass

to be Mdisk (cid:39) 15-20 MEarth (NM12, Nesvorn´y et al. 2013, 2019; Deienno et al. 2017). It was
argued that the massive disk must have been truncated at ∼30 au for Neptune to stop at

30 au (e.g., Gomes et al. 2004). Our tests show that the disk truncation is not required (Fig.

5A full-scale simulation with two million disk particles over 4.5 Gyr requires (cid:39)1000 hours on 2000 Ivy

Bridge cores of the NASA Pleiades Supercomputer.

– 8 –

1). In fact, Neptune may have ended at (cid:39)30 au just because the planetesimal surface density
at (cid:38)30 au was subcritical (Neptune stops if the density is below 1-1.5 MEarth au−1; Nesvorn´y
2018). In other words, Neptune’s current orbit does not constrain the radial gradient of the

planetesimal surface density near 30 au. Instead, it just tells us that the surface density was

low beyond 30 au.

Another constraint on the surface density proﬁle beyond 30 au can be inferred from the
CC population. The mass of CCs was estimated to be MCC ∼ 3 × 10−4 MEarth in Fraser
et al. (2014) but we ﬁnd MCC = (3 ± 2) × 10−3 MEarth from OSSOS (Outer Solar System
Origins Survey; Appendix A). The diﬀerence is caused, at least in part, by diﬀerent observa-

tional datasets used for the analyses (OSSOS biases are carefully characterized) and diﬀerent

magnitude distribution assumptions (we use an exponentially tampered size distribution in

Appendix A). Nesvorn´y (2015b) found that this represents only a fraction of the original

population of planetesimals at 45 au. Adopting our OSSOS estimate, we can therefore very
roughly estimate that the original disk mass density at 45 au was ∼ 10−3 MEarth au−1. To-
gether, the two constraints discussed above imply a strong surface density gradient from

30 au to 45 au. For example, if the linear mass density of the planetesimal disk followed

exp[−(r − 24 au)/∆r], then ∆r ∼ 2.5 au. This is consistent with the total mass and radial

proﬁle of the planetesimal disk that we used for Figure 1.

Here we examine three disk proﬁles: the (1) truncated power-law (surface density Σ ∝
1/rγ with γ = 1-2, truncated at 30 au, a low-mass extension beyond 30 au; Fig. 2a), (2)

exponential (Σ ∝ exp[(r − r0)/∆r]/r, where r0 is the inner edge radius near ∼24 au, and
∆r is one e-fold, no outer truncation here; Fig. 2b), and (3) hybrid proﬁles (power law
Σ ∝ 1/rγ below 28 au, exponential above 28 au; Fig. 2c). Each of our simulations includes

two million disk planetesimals distributed from outside Neptune’s initial orbit at ∼24 au

to >50 au (one million at < 30 au and one million at > 30 au). Such a large number

of bodies is needed to obtain good statistics. The initial eccentricities and inclinations of

planetesimals are set according to the Rayleigh distribution with σe = 0.1 and σi = 0.05.
The planetesimals are assumed to be massless, such that their gravity does not interfere with

the code’s migration/damping routines.

– 9 –

We use weights6 to set up the three proﬁles in Fig. 2. Speciﬁcally, the planetesimals

starting at orbital radius r are given weight w(r), where w(r) follows the selected initial

density proﬁle. The weights are propagated through the simulation and analysis, and used

to gauge the contribution of each particle to the model results, including the color ratios

reported in Sect. 4.3. For the truncated power-law proﬁle in Fig. 2a, the step in the surface

density at 30 au is parametrized by the contrast parameter, c, which is simply the ratio of

densities on either side of 30 au. The exponential and hybrid disks in Figs. 2b and c are

parametrized by one e-fold ∆r. To match the constraints described above, ∆r of the hybrid

disk must be smaller than ∆r of the exponential disk. We assign a color to each simulated
object depending on whether it started at r < r∗ or r > r∗. The color transition at r∗ is

assumed to be a sharp boundary between R and VR.

3.3. Comparison with observations

We use the OSSOS detection simulator (Bannister et al. 2018) to show that our model

results are roughly consistent with the orbital structure of the Kuiper belt. A more system-

atic comparison will be published elsewhere as part of the OSSOS publication series. OSSOS

is the largest Kuiper belt survey with published characterization (1142 ensemble detections;

Bannister et al. 2018). The simulator was developed by the OSSOS team to aid the in-

terpretation of their observations. Given intrinsic orbital and magnitude distributions, the

OSSOS simulator returns a sample of objects that would have been detected by the survey,

accounting for ﬂux biases, pointing history, rate cuts and object leakage (Lawler et al. 2018).

In this work, we input our model results into the OSSOS simulator to compute the

detection statistics. We ﬁrst increase the statistics by performing a 10-Myr integration

starting from t = 4.5 Gyr. The orbital elements of planets and model KBOs are saved with
the 105 yr cadence (generating 100 outputs for each body). For each output, we rotate the

reference system such that Neptune appears near Neptune’s current position on the sky.

This assures a consistency with the OSSOS observations. The OSSOS simulator then reads

the orbital elements of model KBOs on input.

6These weights have no physical meaning. Thay are simply a way of tracking where particles start/end.

– 10 –

The input magnitudes/sizes of KBOs are modeled as broken power-law distributions

(e.g., Fraser et al. 2014).

If the original massive disk is really the main source of all

dynamically hot populations in the Kuiper belt, their size distributions should be similar

and should reﬂect the size distribution of the disk at the time of its dispersal by Neptune.

This is because the collisional evolution in the present-day Kuiper belt is modest and has not

altered the size distribution in the size range of KBOs detected by OSSOS (e.g., Nesvorn´y

& Vokrouhlick´y 2019, their Fig. 12). In more detail, the size distribution can be informed

from Jupiter Trojans because Jupiter Trojans were presumably captured at 5.2 au from

the same source (e.g., Morbidelli et al. 2005, Nesvorn´y et al. 2013; but see Pirani et al.

2019), their size distribution has not evolved after capture (Nesvorn´y et al. 2018) and is

well characterized from observations down to diameters D (cid:39) 5 km (Wong & Brown 2015,

Yoshida & Terai 2017).

Speciﬁcally, we use the cumulative size distribution N (>D) = Nbreak(D/Dbreak)−qbig for
D > Dbreak, where Dbreak is the location of the break, Nbreak is the number of bodies with
D > Dbreak, and N (>D) = Nbreak(D/Dbreak)−qsmall for D < Dbreak. From observations of
Jupiter Trojans and KBOs we set Dbreak (cid:39) 100 km, qsmall (cid:39) 2 and qbig (cid:39) 5. We normalize
Nbreak such that the whole planetesimal disk corresponds to 15-20 MEarth. This gives Nbreak ∼
6 × 107 bodies with a factor of ∼2 uncertainty (mainly due to the uncertain bulk density of

Jupiter Trojans and KBOs). The size distribution of planetesimals beyond 40 au is discussed

in Appendix A. For simplicity, we use the same albedo pV = 0.1 for all populations to convert
between size and absolute magnitude.

Once we make sure that the simulation results are roughly consistent with the number

and orbital distribution of KBOs (Sections 4.1 and 4.2), we proceed by comparing them with

the color data (Section 4.3). For that, we use the color database of Peixinho et al. (2015)

(publicly available at

http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/), the color survey results of Wong & Brown (2017) (356 ob-

jects, data available from authors), published data from the Col-OSSOS survey (Pike et al.

2017, Schwamb et al. 2019, Marsset et al. 2019), and the Neptune Trojan data from Jewitt

(2018) and Lin et al. (2019).

The results for each disk proﬁle and r∗ are compared with the observations discussed

above. Speciﬁcally, we require that: (1) at least ∼90% of Neptune Trojans end up to be

– 11 –

R (the best estimate of the intrinsic VR/R ratio of Neptune Trojans, ∼0.06 from Lin et

al. 2019, has a large statistical uncertainty), (2) over ∼90% of CCs end up to be VR (to

reﬂect the predominantly VR colors among CCs), and (3) the VR/R ratio of dynamically hot

KBOs (HCs, Plutinos, SDOs) obtained in the model matches the VR/R ratio inferred from

observations (intrinsic VR/R ∼ 0.1-0.3; Wong & Brown 2017, Schwamb et al. 2019). The

color distribution is reported here for D > 100 km objects (absolute magnitudes H < 8.1 for

pV = 0.1). Changes of the color ratio with size are not investigated here. Special attention is
given to the correlation of colors with orbital inclination (e.g., Peixinho et al. 2008, Marsset

et al. 2019), which is the chief supporting argument for our color hypothesis (Section 4.3).

3.4. Model caveats

Here we adopt a numerical model with disk planetesimals that do not carry any mass.

Neptune’s migration in the planetesimal disk is mimicked by artiﬁcial forces. This is not

ideal for several reasons. For example, this means that the precession frequencies of planets

are not aﬀected by the disk torques in our simulations, while in reality they were (Batygin

et al. 2011). The direct gravitational eﬀect of the ﬁfth giant planet (NM12) on the disk

planetesimals is also ignored. These additional eﬀects, which may inﬂuence the orbital

structure of the Kuiper belt, are studied elsewhere (Nesvorn´y et al., in preparation).

The weighting scheme described in Sect. 3.2 is used to investigate the eﬀect of diﬀerent

radial proﬁles of the planetesimal disk on the orbital and color distributions of KBOs. This

scheme can strictly be applied only to the outer part of the disk beyond 30 au. For r < 30 au,

the radial disk proﬁle is tied to Neptune’s migration, and changing the proﬁle would mean

that the character of Neptune’s migration would change as well. Given the high computa-

tional expense of these calculations, however, we are unable to resolve this dependence in

full detail. So, we do the next best thing, which is to use the weighting scheme to capture

the dependence on the source material initially available at diﬀerent orbital radii, and diﬀer-

ent migration cases to capture the dependence on the nature of Neptune’s migration. The

development of a more self-consistent model that would account for coupling between these

eﬀects is left for future work.

Ideally, we would like to have a large suite of dynamical models with diﬀerent migration

– 12 –

timescales, diﬀerent histories of Neptune’s orbit (Volk & Malhotra 2019), etc., and choose the

best model by formally ﬁtting the OSSOS dataset. This would also help to establish the un-

certainty of model parameters. Such a systematic exploration of model parameters, however,

is not possible with only four dynamical models available to us (Table 1). Here we therefore

focus on establishing trends with diﬀerent parameters in an attempt to roughly triangulate

the interesting range of possibilities. The main goal of these eﬀorts is to demonstrate the

plausibility of the color hypothesis proposed in Sect. 2.

4. Results

The raw orbital distribution of bodies implanted into the Kuiper belt (t = 4.5 Gyr)

is shown in Figure 3. Note that the raw distribution should not be directly compared to

observations because: it (1) does not account for observational biases and (2) corresponds

to disk proﬁle with w(r) = 1 for all r (which is unphysical; e.g., too much emphasis is given

to bodies starting with r > 30 au). We show these plots to illustrate a typical result of

our simulations. There are several notable features. The resonant populations, including

Neptune Trojans, Plutinos and objects in the 4:3, 2:1 and 5:2 resonances can clearly be

identiﬁed. Interestingly, the planetesimals sourced from r < 35 au tend to evolve to higher

orbital inclinations than the ones from r > 35 au (compare panels (b) and (d) in Fig. 3). We

interpret this trend as a consequence of weakening of Neptune’s gravitational perturbations

with r and use it to discuss the color-inclination correlation in Sect. 4.3.

Another prominent feature in Fig. 3c,d is the concentration of bodies with a (cid:39) 44 au,
e < 0.1 and i < 5◦. The concentration appears in the simulation when planetesimals starting

at ∼40-43 au are captured into the 2:1 resonance with Neptune and subsequently released

from the resonance during Neptune’s jump. The slow migration of Neptune’s 2:1 resonance

after the jump depletes the cold population beyond 45 au. Results similar to these were used

in Nesvorn´y (2015b) to explain the Kuiper belt kernel (Petit et al. 2011). We will discuss

the kernel in more detail in Sect. 4.2. Here we just note that models with a continuous

migration of Neptune (i.e., no jump) produce a dispersed orbital distribution of CCs and no

kernel.

4.1. Number of KBOs

The number of bodies in diﬀerent Kuiper belt populations has been determined from

observations. Petit et al. (2011) estimated that there should be 35, 000 ± 8, 000 HCs with

D > 100 km. Gladman et al.

(2012) found that the population of Plutinos in the 3:2

resonance represents ∼1/3 of the HC population. From this we have ∼12,000 Plutinos with

D > 100 km. Petit et al. (2011) also estimated that there should be ∼95,000 CCs with

D > 100 km, but such a large population would be at odds with Fraser et al. (2014), who

found that the total mass of CCs represents only ∼0.03 of the HC population mass. We

ﬁnd (cid:39)15,000 CCs with D > 100 km from OSSOS (Appendix A). Finally, Lin et al. (2018)

estimated from the Deep Ecliptic Survey that there should be (cid:39)160 Neptune Trojans with

absolute magnitude H < 10 (D > 50 km for albedo pV = 0.07) in the L4 point. Assuming
that the L5 population is similar and approximately re-scaling to D > 100 km, we ﬁnd that
there should be ∼100 Neptune Trojans with D > 100 km. If so, the population of Neptune

Trojans (NTs) would be roughly four times larger than the population of Jupiter Trojans.

We now address the question of how well the migration models investigated in this work

reproduce the inferred number of objects in diﬀerent populations. The s30/100j simulation

yields reasonable results (Fig. 4). Some of the best results are obtained in this case with the

exponential proﬁle and ∆r = 2.5 au, where we identify 40,000 HCs, 25,000 Plutinos, 15,000
CCs and 300 NTs with D > 100 km (here we assume that the original disk contained 6 × 107
D > 100 km planetesimals; Nesvorn´y 2018).7 The s30/100j simulation with the step proﬁle

works as well. Speciﬁcally, with c = 1000, we obtain 35,000 HCs, 20,000 Plutinos, 20,000

CCs and 200 NTs with D > 100 km, which is practically the same result as for the best

exponential proﬁle discussed above. The hybrid disk proﬁles yield intermediate results and

we do not highlight them here.

The s30/100 model (no jump) does not work with the exponential and hybrid proﬁles.

This is because in both these cases, ∆r > 2 au is needed to obtain a roughly correct number

of CCs. But ∆r > 2 au also gives a very large number of Plutinos, both in the absolute

(>70,000 bodies with D > 100 km) and relative terms (the Plutino population ends up to

7The model also gives 10,000 D > 100 km bodies in the 2:1 resonance and 150,000 D > 100 km SDOs.

See, for example, Nesvorn´y (2018) for a discussion of these populations.

– 14 –

be larger than the HC population). This is a consequence of the 3:2 resonance sweeping and

eﬃcient capture of planetesimals from r (cid:39) 32-39 au (Hahn & Malhotra 2005). The truncated

power-law proﬁle can be used to resolve this problem. Indeed, with c = 1000, we obtain

40,000 HCs, 25,000 Plutinos, 15,000 CCs and 450 NTs with D > 100. This is identical to

the s30/100j case with ∆r = 2.5 au, except that there are ∼1.5 times more NTs in s30/100.

We do not consider this to be a problem because the population of NTs is very sensitive to

details of Neptune’s migration history (e.g., Gomes & Nesvorn´y 2016).

The s10/30 (no jump) model gives results that are much less compatible with the struc-

ture of the Kuiper belt than the results discussed above. This applies independently of the

assumed radial proﬁle. For example, with the truncated power-law proﬁle and any value

of c, the s10/30 model gives an excessive number of HCs (over 80,000 with D > 100 km),

Plutinos (over 60,000) and NTs (over 2,000). We do not include the s10/30 model in the

following analysis. The results are better when the jump is applied to Neptune’s orbit in

the s10/30j model, because the jump acts to lower the population of NTs and Plutinos. For

example, with the step proﬁle and c = 1000, we obtain 70,000 HCs, 40,000 Plutinos, 20,000

CCs and 1,000 NTs with D > 100 km. These population estimates are at least a factor of ∼2

higher than what we inferred from the observational constraints above. The s10/30j model
would potentially be plausible if the original disk contained fewer than 6 × 107 D > 100 km

planetesimals. The results for s10/30j and the exponential proﬁle with ∆r = 2.5 au are

similar.

In summary, we identiﬁed the following cases that reasonably well reproduce the number

of KBOs in diﬀerent populations: s10/30j and s30/100j with the exponential proﬁle and

∆r (cid:39) 2.5 au, and s10/30j, s30/100j and s30/100 with the truncated power-law proﬁle and

c (cid:39) 1000. The hybrid proﬁles are plausible as well.

4.2. Orbital distribution

Here we examine the orbital distribution of KBOs. Our goal is to show that the dy-

namical models reproduce the observed structure reasonably well and can thus be used to

investigate Kuiper belt colors. A more detailed statistical analysis of the orbital distribution

will be published elsewhere.

– 15 –

Figure 5 compares the OSSOS detections of KBOs (844 objects in total; some fall

outside the plotted range) and tracked detections from the s30/100j model. To generate the

model distribution in Fig. 5c,d, we use the raw orbital distribution from Fig. 3 and weights

corresponding to the exponential disk proﬁle with r0 = 24 au and ∆r = 2.5 au. This proﬁle
gives the correct number of objects in diﬀerent KBO populations as discussed in the previous

section (Fig. 4a). To simulate the OSSOS detections, we adopt Dbreak = 100 km, qsmall = 2.1
qbig = 5 and pV = 0.1, and instruct the OSSOS simulator to detect and track 844 objects in
total (the same as the total number of OSSOS detections).

The s30/100j model works well to reproduce the general orbital structure of the Kuiper

belt. The model distribution shows populations of bodies in all main orbital resonances

with Neptune, including Neptune Trojans in 1:1, Plutinos in 3:2 and Twotinos in 2:1. There

are also tracked detections in the inner 4:3 resonance, the CKB resonances (e.g., 5:3, 7:4,

8:5), and the outer 5:2 resonance. An interesting diﬀerence between the OSSOS and model

distributions is noted for the 2:1 and 5:2 resonances, where OSSOS detected important “core”

populations (Fig. 5a,b; Volk et al. 2016, Chen et al. 2019). These populations are present

in the raw results (Fig. 3) but are not suﬃciently large to stand out in model detections

(Fig. 5c,d). This issue is not related to Neptune’s jump because the same problem exists

without a jump in the s30/100 simulation. The model with faster Neptune’s migration,

s10/30j, performs better in this respect in that it shows the core populations in the 2:1 and

5:2 resonances, which are only factor of ∼2 below the number of objects actually detected

by OSSOS.

The classical belt produced in the s30/100j model closely replicates the OSSOS CKB

detections. There are HCs with a broad inclination distribution and CCs with low incli-

nations. The Kuiper belt kernel is notable in Fig. 5c,d and its orbital structure is very

similar to that shown in Fig. 5a,b. We compare the orbital distributions of CCs in more

detail below. There is a tail of low-eccentricity and low-inclination orbits beyond the 2:1

resonance which does not have a counterpart in the OSSOS detections. This may indicate

that the radial proﬁle of the original disk was steeper at 45-50 au than the one used here

with ∆r = 2.5 au. For example, if we use ∆r = 2 au instead, the tail population near 50 au

is reduced by a factor of ∼5, which would be more in line with OSSOS observations. This

would also imply a much smaller CC population (Fig. 4a).

– 16 –

Figure 6 compares the orbital distributions for Plutinos. The intrinsic inclination dis-
tribution of Plutinos is very broad with the median (cid:39)15◦. It matches, after being biased

by the OSSOS simulator, the OSSOS detections. Here we used ∆r = 2.5 au. The s30/100j

model with a truncated power-law proﬁle and c (cid:39) 1000 works equally well. This means

that the radial proﬁle of the original planetesimal disk cannot be inferred from the orbital

distribution of Plutinos alone. This information was lost during the implantation process.

The s10/30j models with ∆r = 2.5 au or c (cid:39) 1000 produce similar results, but the biased

model inclination distribution is slightly narrower than the observed one. A general corre-

lation between the inclination distribution of KBOs and Neptune’s migration timescale was

pointed out in Nesvorn´y (2015a; but see Volk & Malhotra 2019).

The OSSOS inclination distribution of HCs shows a potential break near 12◦. Below

this break the distribution is steeply raising such that approximately 60% of detected HCs

have orbital inclinations below the break. The distribution is shallower above the break
and extends to i > 30◦. This feature has previously been noted in Nesvorn´y (2015a) and

interpreted as a consequence of Neptune’s migration into an extended disk. Here we ﬁnd that
the high-i part of the distribution is implanted from r (cid:46) 35 au (implying more excitation) and
the low-i part started at r (cid:38) 35 au (implying less excitation). The inclination distribution of
HCs may therefore help to constrain the radial proﬁle of the original disk. The best results

are obtained with ∆r > 3 au or c < 500 for the s30/100j model creating some tension with

our general preference for ∆r (cid:39) 2.5 au or c (cid:39) 1000. The s10/30j models with ∆r (cid:39) 2.5 au

and c (cid:39) 1000 produce narrower inclination distributions. This may indicate that the actual

migration timescale of Neptune was intermediate between the two timescales investigated

here.

The s10/30j and s30/100j models produce the Kuiper belt kernel (Petit et al. 2011,

Nesvorn´y 2015b). The kernel appears in the OSSOS observations as a strong concentration

of low-i KBOs near 44 au (Fig. 7; also see Fig. 5). The observed kernel has an outer edge at

(cid:39)44.3 au, beyond which the number density of CCs drops by a factor of ∼5. The migration

models with Neptune’s jump work well to reproduce these observations. The s10/30j model

leads to a slightly stronger concentration of bodies below (cid:39)44.3 au (Fig. 7a), whereas the

s30/100j model leads to a slightly weaker concentration (Fig. 7b). Again, this may indicate

that the actual evolution of Neptune’s orbit was intermediate between our two models.

4.3. Colors

The intrinsic VR/R color ratios in diﬀerent KBO populations are plotted for the s30/100j

and s10/30j models in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. In Fig. 8, we set ∆r = 2.5 au (panel a)
and c = 1000 (panel b) and plot the VR/R ratio as a function of the transition radius r∗.
As expected, the VR/R ratios are inversely correlated with r∗ (i.e., lower VR/R values are

obtained for larger transition radii). The proﬁles for the truncated power-law disks show a

slope change near 30 au, which is a reﬂection of the surface density discontinuity in these

models. The exponential disk models lead to a more continuous change of the VR/R ratio

In both cases, CCs show a nearly constant VR/R ratio for
with the transition radius.
30 < r∗ < 43 au and, for obvious reasons, a sudden drop just outside of 43 au. There is

not much diﬀerence between the s10/30j and s30/100j models. We do not have suﬃciently

good statistics for NTs, because the number of bodies captured as Neptune’s co-orbitals is

generally small. That is why the color ratios of NTs in Figs. 8 and 9 are choppy.

Comparing these results with the color constraints discussed in Sect. 3.3 we ﬁnd that
35 < r∗ < 40 au for the exponential proﬁle in Fig. 8a and 30 < r∗ < 40 au for the truncated

power-law proﬁle in Fig. 8b (s30/100j model). For example, using the exponential proﬁle
and r∗ = 37 au we ﬁnd VR/R = 10 for CCs8, VR/R = 0.15 for the hot populations, and
VR/R = 0.05 for NTs. The truncated power-law proﬁle and r∗ = 35 au lead to VR/R = 10

for CCs, VR/R = 0.1 for the hot populations, and VR/R = 0.01 for NTs.

The general trends for the s10/30j model are similar (Fig. 9). Here we opted for using

the exponential proﬁle with ∆r = 3 au (panel a) and the truncated power-law proﬁle with

c = 300 (panel b), because these parameters better match the color constraints. Speciﬁcally,
for ∆r = 3 au and r∗ = 35 au, we obtain VR/R = 7 for CCs, VR/R = 0.3 for hot
If, c = 300 and r∗ = 35 au instead, we get

populations, and VR/R = 0.06 for NTs.

VR/R = 10 for CCs, VR/R = 0.1 for hot populations, and VR/R = 0.02 for NTs. All

these cases therefore satisfactorily replicate the predominance of the VR colors among CCs,

8The color ratio is obtained here for the OSSOS-inferred CC population discussed in Appendix A. If,
instead, we changed our model to approximate the much smaller CC population from Fraser et al. (2014),
the model VR/R ratio of CCs would be much lower, because R objects implanted from r < r∗ to a ∼ 45 au
and i < 5◦ would represent a greater share of CCs. This “pollution” problem does not have simple dynamical
solution and indicates that the CC population may have been sub-estimated in Fraser et al. (2014).

– 18 –

and the predominance of the R colors in other KBO populations. The color transition at
r∗ < 30 au can be ruled out because the VR/R ratio would be generally too high. The color
transition at r∗ > 40 au is not supported as well because the VR/R ratio would be generally
too low. In summary, we ﬁnd that 30 < r∗ < 40 au.

We now consider the correlation between colors and orbital inclinations (e.g., Marsset et

al. 2019). For that, we use the s30/100j model with the exponential proﬁle and ∆r = 2.5 au,
and r∗ = 37 au (the results for other cases are similar, given that 30 < r∗ < 40 au). Bodies are

separated into two color groups: R for bodies starting with r < 37 au and VR for r > 37 au.

We plot the ﬁnal orbits in Fig. 10. The ﬁgure shows that the R objects in each population

–Plutinos, HCs and SDOs– are expected to have wider inclination distribution than the VR

objects. The R objects starting in the inner disk have experienced, on average, stronger

orbital perturbations from Neptune and ended with higher inclinations. This explains the

observed correlation between colors and orbital inclinations, and provides strong support for

the color hypothesis proposed here.

Figure 11 demonstrates this in more detail. Here we re-plot the model results from Fig.

10 as cumulative distributions. For example, (cid:39)95% of VR Plutinos are expected to have
i < 20◦, in a close correspondence to observations (Marsset et al. 2019). In contrast, (cid:39)30%
of R Plutinos have i > 20◦ (Fig. 11a). The R category dominates in the Plutino population,

and, when biased, matches the OSSOS inclination distribution in Figure 6b. Both R and VR

SDOs are expected to have broader inclination distributions than Plutinos (Fig. 11c). The

inclination distribution of HCs is intermediate between Plutinos and SDOs. Interestingly,

the HCs also show the biggest diﬀerence in the inclination distribution of R and VR bodies

(Fig. 11b). This may be reﬂected in Fig. 3 of Marsset et al. (2019), where HCs characterized
as VR by OSSOS cluster near i = 10◦.

Finally, in Fig. 12, we show the inclination distributions of R and VR bodies in the

2:1 resonance (Twotinos). Overall, we ﬁnd the intrinsic VR/R ratio to be (cid:39)0.4, whereas

Sheppard (2012) reported 4 VR and 6 R Twotinos, suggesting observed VR/R ∼ 0.67. These

numbers indicate that Twotinos are a more equal mix of R and VR objects than other KBO

populations (where, typically, one of the color groups dominates). In our model, this is caused

by the 2:1 resonance migration over the r < 47 au region and capture of low-inclination VR

objects into the 2:1 resonance. The orbital inclinations are somewhat increased by capture

– 19 –

but, as Fig. 12 shows, ∼80% of VR objects in the 2:1 resonance still have i < 10◦. Our

expectation is thus that the low-i Twotinos should be predominantly VR, whereas Sheppard
(2012) reported 2 R and 1 VR Twotinos with i < 5◦. It would be useful to obtain colors

for more low-i Twotinos to understand whether they are indeed predominantly VR, as our

model suggests. Another consequence of capture of low-i objects into the 2:1 resonance is

that the inclination distribution of Plutinos should be narrower than that of the 3:2 or 5:2

resonant populations. And this is indeed supported by observations (e.g., Chen et al. 2019).

5. Conclusions

The main ﬁndings of this work are:

1. The dynamical models with slow migration of Neptune reproduce the number of KBOs

in diﬀerent populations and their orbital distribution. The migration timescale is

inferred to be intermediate between the s10/30j and s30/100j models (Table 1). The

jumping Neptune model can explain the Kuiper belt kernel.

2. The diﬀerent proportions of R and VR colors in diﬀerent KBO populations can be
explained if the R bodies formed at radial distances r < r∗ and the VR bodies at
r > r∗, with 30 < r∗ < 40 au. The subsequent evolution mixed R and VR bodies into

diﬀerent populations.

3. The R to VR transition at 30 < r∗ < 40 au in the original planetesimal disk implies

that the inclination distribution of R bodies should be broader than that of VR bodies,

in a close correspondence to observations. This results provides support to the color

hypothesis proposed here.

4. The exponential (2.2 < ∆r < 3.1 au) and truncated power-law (300 < c < 3000) pro-

ﬁles of the original disk work equally well to reproduce various constraints. Additional

work will be needed to distinguish between these possibilities.

The suggested transition from R to VR colors at 30-40 au can be a consequence of the

sublimation-driven surface depletion in some organic molecules, such as NH3 (Brown et al.

– 20 –

2011).

In this case, the transition should have happened at the sublimation radius. An

alternative possibility is that the R-to-VR transition traces diﬀerent collisional histories of

objects. Consider that the original planetesimal disk below 30 au was massive and could have

suﬀered intense collisional grinding over its lifetime (tdisk < 100 Myr; Nesvorn´y 2018). This
may have aﬀected the surface properties of the planetesimals that emerged from <30 au

(via impact related depletion and burial of volatiles). In contrast, the collisional activity

beyond ∼30 au should have been relatively modest due to a lower disk surface density in

this region. Note, however, that the magnitude distributions of R and VR objects in the

dynamically hot populations are similar, at least in the range 7.5 < H < 9 examined by

Wong & Brown (2017), thus ruling out a substantial diﬀerence in the collisional history of

100-km-class KBOs.

Centaurs, presumed to have relatively recently evolved from the Kuiper belt, share the

bimodality of colors and color-inclination correlation with hot KBOs (e.g., Wong & Brown

2017). Observations show that the VR colors of Centaurs disappear when objects reach
r (cid:46) 10 au (Jewitt 2015), probably due to the increased heating and removal/burial of the
very red matter. This explains why Jupiter Trojans at 5 au cannot have VR colors. The

primary reason behind the color similarity of Jupiter and Neptune Trojans (Jewitt 2018),
however, is that both these populations formed at r < r∗ = 30-40 au and did not have the

VR colors to start with.

6. Appendix A

The break in the size distributions of Jupiter Trojans and dynamically hot KBOs is

often interpreted as a result of collisional grinding of planetesimals in the massive original

disk before its dispersal by Neptune (e.g., Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2019; see also Pan & Sari

2005, Fraser 2009, Campo Bagatin & Benavidez 2012). The CC population, instead, given

its low mass and distant orbits, has probably not experienced any intense period of collisional

grinding. Its size distribution may thus reﬂect the initial mass function of planetesimals that

was determined by early formation processes.

Here we use, inspired by existing simulations of the streaming instability (Youdin &

– 21 –

Goodman 2005; see, e.g., Simon et al. 2017, Li et al. 2018), the cumulative size distribution

where A, p, q and D0 are parameters. Here, p is the cumulative power-law slope index
of small bodies. The power law is exponentially tampered for bodies with D (cid:38) D0. The
albedo pV = 0.1 is assumed to convert sizes to absolute magnitudes. By forward modeling
the OSSOS observations of CCs, we ﬁnd A (cid:39) 1.3 × 105, p (cid:39) 0.6, q (cid:39) 1.2 and D0 (cid:39) 60 km.
The OSSOS calibration therefore implies ∼15,000 CCs (this is the number used in the main

text) with D > 100 km, which is a factor of several smaller population than the one reported

by Petit et al. (2011). If pV = 0.2 instead, we obtain ∼5,000 CCs with D > 100 km. For
comparison, CCs have mean pV = 0.13 ± 0.05 (M¨uller et al. 2020) and Arrokoth –member
of the CC population– has pV = 0.23 (Spencer et al. 2020).

Our forward modeling of OSSOS detections also indicates that the current mass of CCs
is MCC (cid:39) 5 × 10−3 MEarth for ρ = 1 g cm−3 bulk density and pV = 0.1. If, instead, pV = 0.2,
then MCC (cid:39) 2 × 10−3 MEarth. Adopting ρ = 0.5 g cm−3, as motivated by observations of
Arrokoth and some CC binaries (Noll et al. 2020), would halve the total mass. In summary,
we ﬁnd MCC = (3 ± 2) × 10−3 MEarth, roughly ∼3-15 larger than the CC mass estimated in
Fraser et al. (2014). Note that the size distribution is uncertain for D < D0 where OSSOS
did not detect a statistically large number of CCs.

In summary, we use the broken power-law distribution for bodies starting in the massive

disk below 30 au and the exponentially tampered power-law distribution for bodies starting

beyond 40 au. The transition radius, rtrans between these distributions is uncertain. We
tested 30 < rtrans < 40 au and found that the orbital and color distribution of D > 100 km
bodies is relatively insensitive to the exact location of this transition. The rtrans parameter
would mainly inﬂuence the population of very small KBOs, where the two distribution

considered here diﬀer the most, but that’s not the subject of this work. All the results

reported in the main text were obtained with rtrans = 40 au. The results with no transition
(i.e., for rtrans > 50 au) are similar.

Table 1: A two stage migration of Neptune was adopted from Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y
(2016): τ1 and τ2 deﬁne the e-folding exponential migration timescales during these stages,
aN,0 and aN denotes Neptune’s initial and ﬁnal semimajor axes, ∆aN is the jump applied to
Neptune’s semimajor axis at the transition between stages 1 and 2, NPluto is the assumed
initial number of Pluto-mass objects in the massive disk below 30 au (Nesvorn´y & Vokrouh-
lick´y 2016). The last columns show the ﬁnal semimajor axis of Neptune and the orbital
period ratio of Uranus and Neptune. For reference, aN = 30.11 au and PN/PU = 1.96 in the
current Solar System. The leading letter “s” in the simulation names indicates that both
these migrations are considered to be slow (Nesvorn´y 2015a), the trailing letter “j” indicates
whether a jump has been applied to Neptune at the transition between Stages 1 and 2.

Fig. 1.— The orbit histories of the giant planets obtained in a self-consistent migration sim-
ulation with a planetesimal disk between 24 and 60 au (total disk mass Mdisk = 20 MEarth).
The initial surface density of planetesimals was assumed to follow a radial proﬁle with ex-
ponentially decreasing surface density from 24 to 60 au with one e-fold ∆r = 2.5 au (no disk
truncation at 30 au). The plot shows the semimajor axes (solid lines) and perihelion/aphelion
distances (thin dashed lines) of each planet’s orbit. The ﬁfth planet (labeled Ice 3) was ejected
from the Solar System by Jupiter during the instability (integration time t = 11.7 Myr). The
solid black lines are Neptune’s exponential migration ﬁts with τ1 = 12 Myr for t < 11.7 Myr
(Stage 1; labeled S1) and τ2 = 27 Myr for t > 11.7 Myr (Stage 2). The ﬁnal orbits of the
planets are a good match to those in the present Solar System.

Fig. 2.— Three planetesimal disk proﬁles used in this work: (a) truncated power law, (b)
exponential, and (c) power-law inner disk and exponential outer disk. The surface density
is arbitrarily normalized here to Σ = 1 at 24 au.

Fig. 3.— The raw orbital distribution of KBOs obtained in the s30/100j model. The ﬁnal
orbits of planetesimals starting with a < 35 au (a > 35 au) are plotted as blue (red) dots
in panels a and b (c and d). The dashed lines show the location of the 3:2 resonance with
Neptune (a = 39.45 au in a and c), perihelion distance q = 36 au (a and c), and inclinations
i = 5◦ and 20◦ (panels b and d).

Fig. 4.— The population estimates from the s30/100j model for diﬀerent initial proﬁles of
the original planetesimal disk. Diﬀerent lines correspond to the main CKB (black), HCs
(blue), CCs (red), Plutinos (green) and Neptune Trojans (yellow). The top panel is the
exponential proﬁle starting at r0 = 24 au. The bottom panel is the truncated power-law
proﬁle with a surface density drop at 30 au. The shaded areas highlight the plausible range
of parameters. The exponential proﬁles with ∆r < 2.2 au can be ruled out because the
population of CCs predicted in such models is too small (<7,000 D > 100 km bodies; most
CCs would be deposited onto their present orbits from r < 30 au if ∆r < 1.5 au). Similarly,
the exponential models with ∆r > 3.1 au can be ruled because the predicted number of CCs
is excessive (>50,000 D > 100 km bodies for ∆r > 3.1 au). Similar arguments based on the
CC population can be used to rule out c < 300 and c > 3000 for the case shown in panel (b).

Fig. 5.— The OSSOS KBOs (left panels) and tracked detections from the s30/100j model
with ∆r = 2.5 au (right panels).
In both cases, the plots show the barycentric orbital
elements referred to the center of mass of the Solar System. For ease of comparison diﬀerent
populations are highlighted by diﬀerent colors: Plutinos (green dots), HCs (blue dots) and
CCs (red dots). The orbital elements of all other KBOs are shown as black dots.

Fig. 6.— A comparison between the biased model (solid black line) and OSSOS observations
(red dots) of Plutinos in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune. Following the method described in
Section 3 we simulate resonant capture of Plutinos from the original planetesimal disk. The
OSSOS simulator was then applied to the present-day intrinsic model distribution (dashed
lines). The large diﬀerence between the intrinsic and biased distributions illustrates the
extreme biases of KBO observations and the importance of the OSSOS simulator. These
results were obtained with an exponential disk proﬁle (r0 = 24 au, ∆r = 2.5 au, Mdisk = 20
MEarth). See Fig. 1 for Neptune’s migration in this case. The (biased model) absolute mag-
nitude (panel a) and orbital inclination (panel b) distributions match OSSOS observations.
The results for orbital eccentricities and libration amplitudes, not shown here, are equally
good.

Fig. 7.— A comparison between the biased models (solid black lines) and OSSOS observa-
tions (red dots) of CCs (i < 5◦). The intrinsic semimajor axis distributions obtained in our
models are shown by dashed lines. Panel (a) shows the result for the s10/30j model and
panel (b) shows the result for the s30/100j model. The Kuiper belt kernel is represented by
a steeply raising semimajor axis distribution toward a break near 44.3 au.

Fig. 8.— The intrinsic VR/R ratio in the s30/100j model for diﬀerent initial proﬁles of the
original planetesimal disk: the (a) exponential proﬁle with ∆r = 2.5 au, and (b) truncated
power-law proﬁle with c = 1000. Diﬀerent lines correspond to CCs (red), hot populations
(blue) and Neptune Trojans (green). The shaded area approximately highlights the possible
range of VR/R transition radii in the original disk.

Fig. 9.— The intrinsic VR/R ratio in the s10/30j model for diﬀerent initial proﬁles of the
original planetesimal disk: the (a) the exponential proﬁle with ∆r = 3 au, and (b) truncated
power-law proﬁle with c = 300. The diﬀerent lines correspond to CCs (red), hot populations
(blue) and Neptune Trojans (green). The shaded area approximately highlights the possible
range of VR/R transition radii in the original disk.

Fig. 10.— The inclination distribution of R (blue dots) and VR (red dots) bodies obtained
in the s30/100j model with ∆r = 2.5 au and r∗ = 37 au. We show the distributions for
Plutinos (left panels), HCs (middle panels) and SDOs (right panels). For each individual
object, we plot 100 orbits from the 10 Myr integration starting at t = 4.5 Gyr (see Section
3.3). Only orbits with i > 5◦ are plotted in the middle plots to avoid confusion with CCs.
In all three cases, the inclination distribution of R objects is broader than the inclination
distribution of the VR objects. Compare to Fig. 3 in Marsset et al. (2019).

Fig. 11.— The proposed color hypothesis implies that the occurrence of R and VR objects
in the hot populations should correlate with orbital inclination. Here we take the model
results from Fig. 10 and plot them as cumulative distributions. Panels (a), (b) and (c) show
Plutinos, HCs and SDOs, respectively. In all cases, the R bodies have a signiﬁcantly broader
inclination distribution than the VR bodies, as observed.

Fig. 12.— The intrinsic inclination distributions of R (blue line) and VR (red line) Twotinos
in the 2:1 resonance with Neptune obtained in the s30/100j model (∆r = 2.5 au and r∗ = 37
au). About 80% of VR Twotinos are expected to have i < 10◦.
