Abstract

To enable realistic studies of massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, the COST 2100

channel model is extended based on measurements. First, the concept of a base station-side visibility

region (BS-VR) is proposed to model the appearance and disappearance of clusters when using a

physically-large array. We ﬁnd that BS-VR lifetimes are exponentially distributed, and that the number

of BS-VRs is Poisson distributed with intensity proportional to the sum of the array length and the

mean lifetime. Simulations suggest that under certain conditions longer lifetimes can help decorrelating

closely-located users. Second, the concept of a multipath component visibility region (MPC-VR) is

proposed to model birth-death processes of individual MPCs at the mobile station side. We ﬁnd that

both MPC lifetimes and MPC-VR radii are lognormally distributed. Simulations suggest that unless

MPC-VRs are applied the channel condition number is overestimated. Key statistical properties of the

proposed extensions, e.g., autocorrelation functions, maximum likelihood estimators, and Cramer-Rao

bounds, are derived and analyzed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), MaMi for short, has since its inception [3]

attracted considerable attention in the wireless communication community [4]–[6]. Within the

last few years, an abundant body of theoretical [5], [6] and experimental [7], [8] research has

shown that MaMi systems can improve the energy and spectral efﬁciencies of today’s wireless

communication systems by one to two orders of magnitude. For this reason, MaMi is considered

a crucial component of the new radio (NR) air interface of the ﬁfth generation (5G) wireless

communication standard [9].

As is well known, the radio propagation channel ultimately dictates the performance of any

wireless communication system. The availability of sufﬁciently accurate propagation channel

models is therefore of critical importance to the design and evaluation of new wireless systems.

The 3GPP SCM-3D [10], the WINNER II/WINNER+ [11], [12], and the COST 2100 [13],

[14] are examples of channel models customarily used in the development and validation of 5G

networks. Among them, the Quasi Deterministic Radio Channel Generator (QuaDRiGa) [15],

[16], an extension of the 3GPP-3D and WINNER II/WINNER+ channel models, is especially

popular because of its enhanced spatiotemporal consistency. Moreover, it possesses certain

features that enable MaMi simulations, namely support for spherical wavefronts, dispersion of

clusters in elevation, and independence of arrival/departure angles [16].

Experiment shows [17]–[19] that at least two additional aspects of the MaMi propagation

channel need to be considered. The ﬁrst of them [17], [18] is the presence at the base station (BS)

of non-stationarities caused by the appearance and disappearance of clusters along physically-

large arrays (PLAs). Such BS-side non-stationarities have been addressed in theoretical MaMi

channel models [20], [21] in which the appearances and disappearances of clusters are typi-

cally modeled as Markov birth-death processes obeying certain survival probabilities. However,

multiuser consistency becomes problematic in such models, because the Markov birth-death

processes are not linked to the geometry of the environment. Whereas the original QuaDRiGa

model neither considers BS-side non-stationarities, nor ensures multiuser consistency, some

progress has been made by Oliveras etal. [22] to remedy these difﬁculties. However, the novel

ideas presented in [22] are yet to be validated by experiments, and integrated in the mainstream

QuaDRiGa model.

Secondly, it appears [23]–[31] that, just as clusters, individual multipath components (MPCs)

3

undergo birth-death processes. The MPC lifetimes when tracked along a straight-line segment at

the mobile station (MS) side have been found to obey certain probability distributions, e.g.,

the exponential distribution [23], [28], [31], the lognormal distribution [26], [29]–[31], and

the Birnbaum-Sanders distribution [30], [31]. More important, closely-located users only a few

wavelengths apart can encounter different MPCs [19]. Channel models that incorporate birth-

death processes at the level of individual MPCs are of interest to emerging applications such as

MaMi communications [32], [33], vehicle-to-vehicle communications [28], [30], or multipath-

assisted localization [26], [27], [31], [34], which can use this information to improve their

performance. To the best of our knowledge, none of the earlier referred 5G channel models

currently considers birth-death processes for individual MPCs.

In this paper, MaMi extensions of the COST 2100 channel model are presented that describe

BS-side non-stationarities of the clusters and MS-side birth-death processes of individual MPCs,

introduced above. The main contributions of the paper are the following:

•

•

•

•

•

The notion of BS-side visibility region (BS-VR) is proposed to model BS-side non-sta-

tionarities. Measured outdoor MaMi channels show that the number of BS-VRs is Poisson

distributed and their lifetimes obey an exponential law.

The maximum likelihood estimator and the Cramer-Rao bound of the parameters of the

BS-VRs are rigorously derived. A closed-form expression of the autocorrelation function

(ACF) of the number of the number of observed BS-VRs is provided.

The inﬂuence of the choice of BS-VR parameters on the MaMi propagation channel is

investigated through simulations. We ﬁnd that under certain conditions longer BS-VRs can

help decorrelating closely-located users.

The notions of MPC-VR and MPC gain function are proposed to model birth-death processes

of individual MPCs at the MS side. Measured indoor MaMi channels reveal that MPC

lifetimes and MPC-VR radii are lognormally distributed.

The small-scale fading ACF with the MPC gain function is always smaller than without

it. When the gain function is applied to a group of closely-located users their condition

number decreases by a few dB and comes to agree with measurements.

The present work extends our preliminary studies in [1] with further analyses, revised insights,

and new measurements to characterize the MPC gain function. A MATLAB implementation of

the COST 2100 model with the proposed extensions is freely available at [35].

III. THE COST 2100 MIMO CHANNEL MODEL

We brieﬂy review some concepts and terminology of the COST 2100 model. For further details,

the reader is referred to [13], [14]. The COST 2100 model falls into the category of geometry-

based stochastic channel models (GSCM) [36], which are built around the notion of a cluster, i.e.,

a group of MPCs with similar delay and angular parameters [37]. Clusters model interactions of

the transmit signal with scattering objects in the environment such as building facades, trees and

street furniture, in outdoor environments, or inner walls, pillars and ofﬁce equipment, in indoor

settings. Interactions happen at so-called scattering points. In GSCMs, the locations of clusters

and scattering points are drawn randomly from prescribed multivariate distributions depending

on the simulated environment. MPCs are then obtained by mere geometric ray tracing of the

transmit signal through the scattering points [13].

The distinguishing feature of the COST 2100 model is perhaps the use of so-called visibility

regions (VRs) to model non-stationarities in a spatiotemporally consistent way. When a MS

moves inside a VR, the associated cluster is active and its MPCs contribute to the MS-BS

double-directional impulse response. Similarly, when the MS moves out of a VR, the associated

cluster is no longer visible and it does not contribute. The situation is depicted in Fig. 1a. The two

MaMi channel aspects alluded to in the introduction are also shown. The ﬁrst aspect, illustrated

in Fig. 1b, has to do with the presence of non-stationarities at the BS side in MaMi settings with

PLAs [17], [18]; the second one, illustrated in Fig. 1c, concerns the realization that individual

MPCs undergo birth-death processes at the MS side [23]–[31]. To model these phenomena, the

COST 2100 channel model is extended with the concepts of BS-VRs, in Sec. IV, and MPC-VRs

and MPC gain functions, in Sec. V.

IV. EXTENSION FOR PHYSICALLY-LARGE ARRAYS

A. Measurements and Data Processing

Channels used in this section were measured at the parking lot outside the E-building of the

Faculty of Engineering of Lund University, Lund, Sweden. At the BS side, a 7.5 m-long, 128-

element virtual uniform linear array (ULA) was mounted on a rooftop, three ﬂoors above the

ground level. Eight MS sites, four in line-of-sight (LOS) propagation conditions to the BS and

four in non-LOS (NLOS), were considered. At each site, the radio channel between the ULA

and a single-antenna MS was measured at ﬁve locations interspaced by 0.5 m. Measurements

were acquired at a carrier frequency of 2.6 GHz, and over a bandwidth of 50 MHz. All antennas

were vertically-polarized and omnidirectional on the horizontal plane.

To extract clusters of MPCs, the measured channels were subsequently processed in the follow-

ing way. First, the ULA was partitioned into sets of neighboring antennas by using a 10 element-

long sliding window. Then, MPC parameters (i.e., delay, azimuth angle-of-arrival, and complex

amplitudes) were estimated by applying the SAGE [38] super-resolution channel estimation

algorithm to each window. Finally, clusters were identiﬁed using the KPowerMeans [37] joint

clustering and tracking algorithm. Clusters containing less than 2.5% of the total power in any

window, or surviving less than 5 windows, were discarded. See [7] for further details.

B. System Model and Assumptions

Because of the nature of the measurements available, the scope of this section is limited to

ULAs. However, the results obtained below can be extended to the case of two-dimensional

arrays by applying, e.g., the techniques demonstrated in Sec. V-B. Such an extension is best

addressed with complementary measurements and therefore we leave it for future work.

Let the ULA be located at 0

x2, and assume that BS-VRs can be modeled as

rate; and (iii) Pr(at least two birth events during (x, x + h]) = o(h) as h

0. By [39,

→

Chapter 8, Deﬁnition II], this is equivalent to the assertion that the birth count process

Nbirth(x) = # births events in (0, x],

is a Poisson process with intensity λ > 0.

A2. The true lifetimes of BS-VRs are (i) independent copies of some nonnegative random
R+ with ﬁnite ﬁrst moment;

variable Y with probability density function (PDF) fY : R+
(ii) independent of birth events.

→

A3. In experiments one can only observe (perhaps partially) BS-VRs that overlap with [x1, x2].

Hence, the outcome of any experiment is a sequence of intervals [a1, b1], . . . , [an, bn]
[x1, x2], where a1 ≤
bn −

an are the observed birth positions, υ1 = b1 −

an the observed lifetimes, and n the number of observed BS-VRs.

C. Distribution of the Number of BS-VRs

Let the random variable N(x1, x2) denote the number of BS-VRs observed in the interval

[x1, x2]. Then, some natural questions to ask are: What is the expected number of observed
BS-VRs, E(N(x1, x2))? And, how does this number depend on the interval length x2 −
To answer these questions, in this section we derive the distribution function of N(x1, x2). We

x1 ≥

0?

start by noting that the total number of observed BS-VRs can be written as the sum of two

independent contributions:

•

•

7

The number, Nnew(x1, x2), of BS-VRs “born” in the interval (x1, x2]. Clearly, this quantity

can be obtained by the difference

Nnew(x1, x2) = Nbirth(x2)

Nbirth(x1).

−

Since Nbirth(x) is, by hypothesis, a Poisson process, it follows that

(3)

The number, Nalive(x1), of BS-VRs born before, and still alive at, x = x1. The distribution of

Nalive(x) for x1 sufﬁciently far away from x = 0 is given as part of the proof of Theorem 1.

The following result is a key ingredient of our proposed channel model extension for PLAs.

Theorem 1 (Number of observed BS-VRs for PLAs). Let the assumptions in Sec. IV-B hold.

Then, the number of observed BS-VRs in the interval [x1, x2] has the distribution

Clearly, only birth events Nbirth(x1) that lead to BS-VRs extending past x = x1 contribute to

Remark 1. Note that Theorem 1 gives us the answers we seek, namely that for PLAs, the

expected number of observed BS-VRs, E(N(x1, x2)), depends on the environment through (i)
the intensity λ > 0 of the underlying Poisson process, and (ii) the mean E(Y ) of the true BS-VR
lifetimes; and on the system through (iii) the length L = x2 −
that the speciﬁc shape of the distribution fY : R+

x1 of the PLA. In particular, note

R+ does not matter.

→

Remark 2. In this paper we are interested mainly in extensions of the COST 2100 model

supporting MaMi, but it is also instructive to compare these with the “conventional” COST

2100 model, which only considers physically-compact arrays (PCAs). Observe that

so that the number of VRs observed by a PCA placed anywhere along the line of the PLA is

N(x1, x2)

Nalive(x) as x1, x2 →

(9)

As a matter of fact, the conventional COST 2100 models the number of visible far clusters (and

thus of VRs) as being Poisson-distributed with a certain prescribed intensity which depends on

the simulated environment; see [13, Chapter 3]. Thus, our proposed channel model extension

for PLAs naturally contains and generalizes the conventional COST 2100 model.

Fig. 2 veriﬁes Theorem 1 empirically. In particular, the empirical cumulative density functions

(ECDFs) of Nalive(x1), Nnew(x1, x2), and N(x1, x2) for the measured LOS sites described in

Sec. IV-A are presented, along with Poisson ﬁts. Empirical curves are based on 20 samples,

ﬁve from each measured LOS site. A quick inspection reveals that these quantities are well

approximated by Poisson-distributed random variables; the Chi-square goodness-of-ﬁt test at

signiﬁcance level α = 0.05 statistically conﬁrms this visual impression. Empirical evidence

from measured NLOS sites (not shown due to lack of space) also supports the hypothesis that

the number of observed BS-VRs is well modeled by (2), (4), and (7).

and so the inﬂuence of the parameter LBS is limited. In fact, (23) reveals that the normalized

CRLBs are dominated by the inverse of the intensity-aperture product λ0L0. Increasing the
length L of the array can therefore reduce the variance of ˆθ signiﬁcantly. Likewise, better
performance of ˆθ should be expected in environments with many scatterers (clusters) such that λ

is large. We also note from (23) that the effect of the minimum feature size ∆0 on the CRLBs
can be mostly neglected so long as ∆0

The second equation in (24) follows from the identity E(υ) = LBSL0
LBS+L0
by T = Λ0

, and by approximating E(υ)
n . MoM-based estimators are sometimes used in the literature [42].3 According to the
simulations, the MLE performs better than the MoME. As the intensity-aperture product λ0L0

increases, the MoME lags behind the MLE, which steadily approaches the CRLB and becomes

efﬁcient.4 As can be seen, estimating λ is easier than estimating LBS, where “easier” means here
that the RMSE approaches √CRLB more rapidly. For instance, the MLE of λ can be considered

efﬁcient as early as λ0L0 = 5, while that of LBS requires λ0L0 = 15 or larger to be considered

within range of the CLRB. A somewhat surprising observation is that the performance of the

MLE improves as the ratio LBS
L0

increases. (By contrast, the performance of the MoME appears

to be rather insensitive to the value of LBS.) This can be explained by the fact that as LBS grows

larger for ﬁxed λ0L0, more BS-VR lifetimes are (partially) observed by the PLA, contributing

to improve estimation accuracy. Another interesting remark is that the amount of fully observed

BS-VR lifetimes is only a fraction of the total; thus, developing estimators that can reliably cope

with truncated observations appears to be of great importance.

3The derivation of (24) uses (i) Y ∈ Exp(LBS), and (ii) E(υ) = LBSL0

LBS+L0 , none of which is obvious. Less sophisticated
estimators are possible. One can, for instance, assume Y constant (and thus knowledge of type (i) is not needed), or ignore the

fact that observed BS-VR lifetimes may be truncated (and thus knowledge of type (ii) is not needed). Such simpler estimators

abound in the literature, but their performance is generally poor (neglecting (i) leads to data-model mismatch, and (ii), to biased

estimators). In this work we ignore these simpler estimators and focus on the MoME and, especially, the MLE.

4We have numerically veriﬁed that both the MLE and the MoME are asymptotically unbiased as λ0L0 → ∞.

(25)

Compared to Fig. 4, the relative RMSEs have been divided by √4. This is because each of the

four measurement sites is assumed to produce uncorrelated observations. In view of the above,

when designing measurement campaigns with PLAs one should perhaps ensure

λ0L0 > 15,

and λ0L0N0 > 100

(26)

or so, where N0 is here the number of uncorrelated experiments. In the next section we discuss

when two experiments can be considered uncorrelated.

E. Autocorrelation Function of Observed BS-VRs

Of considerable importance to characterize an stochastic process is the autocorrelation function

(ACF) of the process.

Theorem 4 (Autocorrelation function). Let N(x, r), with (x, r)
R2, denote the number
of far clusters visible from BS array location x and MS location r, and deﬁne the covariance

F. Results and Validation

To gain more insight into the behavior of the proposed BS-VR extension of the model and

the inﬂuence of the mean lifetime and intensity, simulation results of a PLA and K = 9 single-

antenna users in NLOS propagation conditions are presented in Fig. 5. Users are located in an

outdoor environment at distance R from the BS; the angular separation between adjacent MSs

is one degree. At the BS side, a ULA with M = 128 λ/2-spaced antennas spanning L = 7.5

meters is used. All antennas are vertically-polarized and omnidirectional in the azimuth plane.

Simulation results have been obtained from 100 runs using the parameters in Table II. The carrier

frequency is 2.6 GHz and the bandwidth, sampled at 257 equispaced points, 50 MHz.

are shown, of which several interesting remarks can be made. Firstly, κdB can decrease as the

mean BS-VR lifetime, LBS, increases (for ﬁxed λ), which is in contrast to common wisdom

stipulating that spatial separability improves as more array sections are exposed to different

environments. Secondly, κdB decreases as the BS-VR process birth-rate, λ, increases for ﬁxed

LBS > 0. In this case, the reason is that larger values of λ entail richer environments with more

scatterers (clusters), which facilitates spatial separability. Thirdly, κdB decreases as the BS-MS

distance, R, increases for ﬁxed MS angular separation. By the discussion in the preceding section,
the MS-side LSF ACF, RN (∆r), is low for R

number, κdB. Conversely, RN (∆r) goes to one as R
increase of κdB. (This is despite the fact that spherical effects become more noticeable at close

0, the overall effect being a noticeable

range, pulling the BS-side small-scale fading (SSF) ACF, RN (x1, x2), toward zero.)

V. EXTENSION FOR CLOSELY-LOCATED USERS

Using indoor measured channels, we next characterize, analyze, and validate an extension of

the COST 2100 model that describes individual MPCs at the MS side in terms of birth-death

processes, and which is of particular relevance for MaMi systems with closely-located users.

A. Distribution and Intensity of MPC Lifetimes

The results of this section are based on channel measurements in a large sports hall (20 m

36 m

×

7.5 m) in the 2.6 GHz band. The radio channel between a conical monopole omnidi-

rectional antenna moving on a 15-m-long straight-line track and a ﬁxed cylindrical array with

128 antennas was sampled at an average rate of 400 snapshots/m. The snapshots obtained in

this way were then processed using a phase-based extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) that was able

to track the MPC parameters MPC of the propagation channel along a 15 m route. The reader

is referred to [31] for further discussion of the measurements and their processing.

To analyze the lifetimes of MPCs, we adopt the modeling framework introduced in Sec. IV-B.

we have L = 15 m, ∆0 = 7.5 cm, and n = 752.

Y ]T be a (p + 1)-dimensional vector of parameters to be estimated,
and let x = [a1, b1, a2, . . . , bn] be a 2n-dimensional vector of data. To model the MPC lifetimes
we restrict attention to the following three cases:

are given in [40].

common approach in the literature [30], [31].

Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the ECDF obtained from measurements, and the CDFs corre-

sponding to cases 1), 2), and 3). According to the ﬁgure, the best ﬁt is the lognormal one (case

2). An exponential ﬁt (case 1) matches measurements poorly, underestimating the cumulative

density function for short- and medium-lived MPCs (υ

2 m) and overestimating it for long-

≤

lived ones (υ > 2 m). The lognormal ﬁt of case 2, on the other hand, shows an excellent

agreement over the entire range of the observations. Even the proportion of lifetimes exceeding L,

namely Pr(Y > L), is best explained by the lognormal distribution, as shown in the inset. Turning

to the truncated lognormal case, the ﬁgure shows that when observed (Υ) rather than true (Y )

MPC lifetimes are modeled, the resulting ﬁt may not be satisfactory even when the “correct”

(lognormal) distribution is being used (see also [30], [31]). The problem is that the observation

model of case 3) takes observations υ1, . . . , υn at face value, and neglects the fact that MPCs

may extend beyond the measurement track, at one or both ends. The data shown in Table I

20

further emphasizes this point.

B. Distribution of MPC-VR Radii

In order to model the lifetime of individual MPCs within a cluster we introduce the concept

of MPC visibility region (MPC-VR), which is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1c in Sec. III.

In the ﬁgure, MPC-VRs are represented by discs contained within a certain MS-VR. There is

a one-to-one correspondence between the MPC-VRs of a certain MS-VR, and the scattering

points of the associated cluster. When the MS enters a MPC-VR, the corresponding scattering

point becomes active and contributes to the propagation channel. To give an example, active

MPC-VRs in Fig. 1c have been marked gray. It is a simple but crucial observation that different

MSs do not necessarily “see” the same set of active MPCs, even when they do have the same set

of active MS-VRs; we will apply this later to establish that the SSF ACF decays more rapidly

than when the concept of MPC-VR is not applied.

Let a MS move along the X-axis, and let MPC-VRs be distributed uniformly on the XY -

plane. Then, the distribution of the MPC lifetimes encountered during the movement (i.e., the

length of the intersecting chords) is

In our case, however, a further generalization is possible: Fig. 7, bottom right, shows the

C. Distribution of MPC-VR Amplitudes

We model the relative contribution of each MPC to the total channel gain by means of the

so-called gain function [1], [7]. More precisely, a Gaussian proﬁle
rg,ℓ)2

gMPC,ℓ(rMS) = exp(

d(rMS −

−

)

(40)

multiplies the complex amplitude of each MPC, where the weight gMPC,ℓ(rMS) depends on the
Euclidean distance between the user position rMS = [rMS,x, rMS,y, rMS,z]T and the center rg,ℓ =
[rg,ℓ,x, rg,ℓ,y]T of the ℓ-th MPC-VR measured on the XY -plane:

d(rMS −

rg,ℓ) =

(rMS,x −

rg,ℓ,x)2 + (rMS,y −

rg,ℓ,y)2.

q

Thus, at distance, e..g., σg,ℓ from its center, the MPC gain function has decayed by 4.3 dB. The
centers rg,ℓ are generated uniformly inside the corresponding MS-VRs, which are assumed to
R+. The proﬁle widths σg,ℓ are identiﬁed with the radii RMPC, and follow
have radius RC ∈
a lognormal distribution with parameters see (39). Thanks to the MPC gain function feature,

variations observed [26], [31], [46] in the gain of individually tracked MPCs can be adequately

modeled, helping to smoothly ramp up (fade out) the contributions of new-born (dead) MPCs,

as users navigate in an out of the MPC-VRs.

D. Results and Validation

To validate the proposed extension, we here study the autocorrelation function and the channel

condition number.

1) Autocorrelation Function: One important result in this paper is the following:

2) Channel Condition Number: It turns out that the MPC gain function has quite a noticeable

effect on the condition number κ(H(t, f )), where H(t, f ) is the K

M channel matrix at time t

×

and frequency f of an MU-MIMO system with K single-antenna users and M BS antennas. In

8Due to lack of space, the detailed results of this comparison are omitted, and only a short summary is given. See towards

the end of the next section for related comments.

 
 
 
 
27

Fig. 8, a comparison of simulated MU-MIMO channels with and without the MPC gain function

is presented. In particular, CDFs of the logarithmic channel condition number

κdB(H(t, f )) = 20 log10(κ(H(t, f )))

(50)

of K = 9 closely-located, single-antenna users in a LOS, public auditorium [19, indoor site

MS 1] are shown. We consider both directive and omnidirectional antenna patterns. Directive

antenna patterns have been measured with an upper body phantom [49] and in our simulations are

oriented towards the auditorium stage. At the BS side, a compact cylindrical array with measured

antenna patterns have been used. We consider M = 32 and 128 BS antennas. The positions and

spreads of clusters are set as in the actual measured environment, while the rest of the COST

2100 model parameters have been extracted from measured indoor channels [50] and are reported

in Table II. Simulation results are based on data from 10 runs. For each run, B = 257 frequency

points over 50 MHz of bandwidth, and T = 10 positions (i.e., snapshots) over 0.25 m of a

straight line, one for each user, have been simulated. For comparison, the CDFs obtained from

measured channels are also included (black, dotted line). Prior to computing κdB, the complex

gains of both simulated and measured channels have been normalized by the expression

As can be seen, when the MPC gain function is included in the simulations (“ON” label),

a good agreement is observed between simulated and measured channels for both 32 and 128

BS antennas. On the other hand, not including it (“OFF” label) results in too large values

of κdB by about 10 dB. This gap between the “ON” and “OFF” cases is reduced by 2 dB or
so when measured rather than omnidirectional antenna patterns are applied.9 This improvement

alone, however, is not sufﬁcient to explain the observed low values of κdB measured, and the

introduction of a MPC gain function seems to be required for realistic channel simulations.

9This can be explained as follows. When the MPC gain function is turned “OFF” directive antennas can, by selecting different

MPCs, help decorrelating the users’ radio channels. When the gain function is turned “ON” users already “see” different MPCs

and directive antenna patterns, by ﬁltering away some of the MPCs, may have an adverse effect.

28

To gain further insights into the behavior of the MPC gain function in multiuser systems,

we next study the dependence of κdB on the angular spreads of the environment. For this we

adopt a simple propagation model consisting of only one cluster whose MS- and BS-side angular

spreads, denoted respectively by ΩMS and ΩBS, can be controlled independently. (This is called

a “twin” cluster in the terminology of the COST 2100 model [13]). Fig. 9 shows the average

¯κdB =

of κdB for various MS- (left) and BS-side (right) angular spread values. Here, T = 300, and for

t=1
X

each 1

t

≤

≤

T the locations of the users have been randomly assigned inside a 2 m radius

circle. Furthermore, we have set the MPC-VR radius RMPC = 0.5, the effective number of

MPCs N eﬀ

MPC = 100, the number of users K = 9, and the number of BS antennas M = 128.

In general, the channel condition number, ¯κdB, decreases as the angular spreads increase. When

the MPC gain function is turned “ON”, ¯κdB always attains a lower value. Moreover, this value

mainly depends on the BS angular spread ΩBS, and not so much on the MS angular spread ΩMS.

When, on the other hand, the MPC gain function is turned “OFF”, we see that ¯κdB depends

on both ΩBS and ΩMS. This has interesting implications for the design and validation of MaMi

systems. Most notably, the plots in Fig. 9 suggest that users having angular spreads as small

as ΩMS = 5◦ can still be served concurrently provided that ΩBS and M are sufﬁciently large.

Conversely, if the decorrelating effects of the MPC gain function are not properly accounted for,

results involving closely-located users may be overly pessimistic, even for large ΩBS and M.

The signiﬁcance of the MPC gain function will depend on the spatial density of concurrently

served users, that is, the number of users communicating over the same time-frequency resource

in a certain limited region. In the bottom pane of Fig 9, plots of the gap

δ¯κdB = ¯κdB,OFF −

¯κdB,ON

(54)

between the “ON” and “OFF” states are presented for ΩBS = 60◦, ΩMS = 15◦, 30◦, 60◦, and K =

2, . . . , 18. As can be seen, the gain function has a negligible effect for low values of K, but its

impact becomes noticeable as K increases, in good agreement with our comments in Sec. V-D1.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Certain important aspects of the MaMi propagation channel are not captured by prevalent

channel models. In this paper, we extend the conventional COST 2100 model with the concepts of

large array; and (2) MPC-VRs and MPC gain function, to model, at the MS side, birth-death

processes of individual MPCs. Based on measurements of MaMi channels, the parameters of the

proposed extensions have been statistically characterized, and their impact on the properties of

MaMi propagation channels investigated theoretically and by simulations. In addition, it has been

shown that simulation results are consistent with measurements of closely-located users, which

demonstrates that the proposed extensions are able to capture the intended MaMi characteristics.

A MATLAB implementation of the COST 2100 model with the proposed extensions (as well

as full support of other essential, but not discussed in this paper, MaMi characteristics such

as spherical wavefronts and cluster dispersion in elevation) is freely available at [35]. Most

importantly, this implementation provides a complete simulation framework for studies of MaMi

channels for 5G and beyond.
