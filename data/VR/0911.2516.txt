ABSTRACT

Context. Eight Accreting Millisecond X–ray Pulsars (AMXPs) are known to date. Although these systems are well studied at high
energies, very little information is available for their optical/NIR counterparts. Up to now, only two of them, SAX J1808.4−3658 and
IGR J00291+5934, have a secure multi-band detection of their optical counterparts in quiescence.
Aims. All these systems are transient Low-Mass X–ray Binaries. Optical and NIR observations carried out during quiescence give a
unique opportunity to constrain the nature of the donor star and to investigate the origin of the observed quiescent luminosity at long
wavelengths. In addition, optical observations can be fundamental as they ultimately allow us to estimate the compact object mass
through mass function measurements.
Methods. Using data obtained with the ESO-Very Large Telescope, we performed a deep optical and NIR photometric study of the
ﬁelds of XTE J1814−338 and of the ultracompact systems XTE J0929−314 and XTE J1807−294 during quiescence in order to look
for the presence of a variable counterpart. If suitable candidates were found, we also carried out optical spectroscopy.
Results. We present here the ﬁrst multi-band (VR) detection of the optical counterpart of XTE J1814−338 in quiescence together with
its optical spectrum. The optical light curve shows variability in both bands consistent with a sinusoidal modulation at the known 4.3
hr orbital period and presents a puzzling decrease of the V−band ﬂux around superior conjunction that may be interpreted as a partial
eclipse. The marginal detection of the very faint counterpart of XTE J0929−314 and deep upper limits for the optical/NIR counterpart
of XTE J1807−294 are also reported. We also brieﬂy discuss the results reported in the literature for the optical/NIR counterpart of
XTE J1751−305.
Conclusions. Our ﬁndings are consistent with AMXPs being systems containing an old, weakly magnetized neutron star, reactivated
as a millisecond radio pulsar during quiescence which irradiates the low-mass companion star. The absence of type I X–ray bursts and
of hydrogen and helium lines in outburst spectra of ultracompact (Porb < 1 hr) AMXPs suggests that the companion stars are likely
evolved dwarf stars.

1. Introduction

Some Low Mass X–ray Binaries (LMXBs) exhibit sporadic out-
burst activity while for most of their time they remain in a state
of low-level activity; these systems are commonly referred to
as X-ray transients (White et al. 1984). Historically, the classiﬁ-
cation of X-ray transients is made on the basis of their spectral
hardness. The outbursts of Soft X-ray Transients (SXTs), charac-
terized by equivalent bremsstrahlung temperatures ≤ 15 keV, are
often accompanied by a pronounced increase in the luminosity
of their (faint) optical counterparts and by the onset of type I X-
ray burst activity (Maraschi & Cavaliere 1977; Woosley & Taam
1976). During quiescence, these transient systems are very faint
in X-rays (1032 − 1033 erg s−1) and their optical luminosity drops
by as much as 6-7 mag, giving a unique opportunity for the
study of their companion stars. These properties clearly asso-

ciate SXTs with LMXBs containing an old, weakly magnetized,
neutron star, (for a review see, e.g. Campana et al. 1998). In the
following we will refer to these systems as Low-Mass X–ray
Transients (LMXTs).

It has long been suspected that millisecond radio pulsars are
the spun-up products of sustained mass transfer onto neutron
stars in LMXBs. According to this scenario, the companions
in the LMXBs evolve and transfer matter onto the neutron star
on a long time-scale, spinning it up to periods as short as a few
ms. This model has gained strong support about ten years ago
thanks to the launch of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
satellite that discovered kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations
(kHz QPOs) as well as coherent oscillations during type-I
X-ray bursts in a number of LMXBs (e.g. Strohmayer et al.
1996). These periodicities are interpreted as the millisec-
ond spin periods of weakly magnetic neutron stars. In April
1998 the ﬁrst Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar (AMXP)
was discovered, with a 401 Hz (2.5 ms) X-ray pulsations
(SAX J1808.4-3658; Wijnands & van der Klis 1998). This
conclusion was further strengthened by the discovery of addi-
tional systems in the following years. Eight such systems are

2003);
J1900.1-2455 (Morgan et al. 2005) and SWIFT J1756.9-2508
(Krimm et al. 2007)1. These ﬁndings directly conﬁrmed evolu-
tionary models that link the neutron stars of LMXBs to those of
millisecond radio pulsars, the former being the progenitors of
the latter. All these systems are LMXTs, have orbital periods
in the range between 40 min and 4.3 hr and spin frequencies
from 1.7 to 5.4 ms. These eight accreting millisecond pulsars
are well studied at high energies, especially in X−rays, both
during outburst and quiescence (see Wijnands 2006 for a
review). On the other hand, with the signiﬁcant exception of
SAX J1808.4−3658 and IGR J00291+5934, their optical/NIR
quiescent counterparts are only poorly known. The optical light
curve of SAX J1808.4−3658 in outburst and quiescence shows
variability modulated at the orbital period, in antiphase with
the X−ray light curve (Giles et al. 1999; Homer et al. 2001;
Campana et al. 2004). This is unlike other quiescent transients
that normally show a double-humped morphology, due to an
ellipsoidal modulation, and indicates that the companion star is
exposed to some irradiation. The same behaviour is seen in the
quiescent optical light curve of IGR J00291+5934 (D’Avanzo
et al. 2007)2. In a theoretical study on SAX J1808.4−3658
Burderi et al. (2003) proposed, on the base of previous works
(Stella et al. 1994; Campana et al. 1998), that the irradiation
is due to the release of rotational energy by the fast spinning
neutron star, switched on, as a radio pulsar, during quiescence.
Following this idea, Campana et al. (2004) and D’Avanzo et
al. (2007) measured the required irradiating luminosity needed
to match the optical ﬂux of SAX J1808.4−3658 and IGR
J00291+5934, respectively, and found that it is a factor of about
100 larger than the observed quiescent X−ray luminosity for
both systems. Neither accretion−driven X−rays nor the intrinsic
luminosity of the secondary star or the disk can account for
it. So, these authors conclude that the only source of energy
available within these systems is the rotational energy of the
neutron star, reactivated as a millisecond radio pulsar.

Among the eight accretion-powered millisecond X–ray pul-
sars known to date, four of them are in ultracompact systems,
with orbital periods shorter than 60 minutes. Three of these ultra-
compact systems, XTE J1751−305, XTE J0929−314 and XTE
J1807−294 are remarkably homogeneous, with measured orbital
periods of 42.4, 43.6 and 40.1 minutes respectively, well below
the minimum period for a system with a donor composed pri-
marily of hydrogen (Porb ≤ 80 min; Rappaport et al. 1982).

Optical and NIR observations performed in the past by dif-
ferent groups only led to deep upper limits for the counterparts
of XTE J1751−305 (Jonker et al. 2003) and XTE J1814−338
(Krauss et al. 2005) or to the detection of very faint candidates,
if any (Monelli et al. 2005 for XTE J0929−314). No observa-
tions of XTE J1807−294 during quiescence have been reported
to date, while HETE J1900.1-2455 is still in outburst and SWIFT

1 Very recently, episodes of coherent ms X-ray pulsations were dis-
covered in archival data of the LMXTs Aql X-1 (Casella et al. 2008)
and SAX J1748.9-2021 (Altamirano et al. 2008). We will not consider
these sources in the present paper.

2 A recent paper of Jonker et al. (2008) pointed out evidence for a
change in the quiescent level of IGR J00291+5934 and for strong ﬂaring
episodes. A slight phase diﬀerence in the folded light curve is also found
with respect to that reported in D’Avanzo et al. (2007)

J1756.9-2508 has been discovered very recently (June 2007).
The intrinsic faintness of the targets during quiescence, in com-
bination with the large interstellar absorption and high stellar
crowding of the relevant ﬁelds clearly explain the lack of detec-
tions at optical wavelengths.

2. Observations and data reduction

Optical and NIR observations of the ﬁeld of XTE J1814−338,
XTE J0929−314 and XTE J1807−294 were carried out with
the ESO Very large Telescope (VLT), using FORS1, FORS2
and ISAAC. All nights were clear, with seeing in the range
0.5′′ − 1.0′′. For XTE J1814−338 we collected from the ESO
archive3 VR images taken with the FORS2 camera on nights
2004 May 20-21. A set of about 8 images of 5-6 min integra-
tion were obtained every night which cover about 30 − 40% of
the 4.3 hr orbital period at each ﬁlter. From the ESO archive we
downloaded VRI images of the ﬁeld of XTE J0929−314 taken
with the FORS1 camera on nights 2003 December 19-20-21.
The dataset consists of a set of 6 images of 5 min integration
that cover more than twice per night the 43.6 min orbital period
at each ﬁlter. We observed the ﬁeld of XTE J1807−294 with
our approved program ID 077.D-0677(D) in service mode with
the ISAAC camera. Observations were carried out in J−band
on 2006 May 5 and covered about 92% of the 40.1 min orbital
period of the system. In addition, we collected from the ESO
archive VRI images taken with the FORS2 camera on night 2004
June 10 that cover about 30%−60% of the orbital period. We also
obtained optical spectra of the counterpart candidates of XTE
J1814−338 and XTE J1807−294 with the FORS1 camera on
nights 2007 September 2-3 during our observing run approved
under program ID 079.D-0884(A). The complete observing log
is presented in Table 1

Image reduction was carried out following standard pro-
cedures: subtraction of an averaged bias frame, division by
a normalized ﬂat frame; NIR frames were reduced using the
ISAAC pipeline data reduction jitter, part of the ECLIPSE4
package. Astrometry was performed using the USNOB1.05 and
the 2MASS6 catalogues. PSF-photometry was made with the
ESO-MIDAS7 daophot task for all the objects in the ﬁeld. The
photometric calibration was done against Landolt standard stars
for VRI ﬁlters and against the 2MASS catalog for NIR ﬁlters. In
order to minimize any systematic eﬀect, we performed diﬀeren-
tial photometry with respect to a selection of local isolated and
non-saturated reference stars.

Our spectra of XTE J1814−338 and XTE J1807−294 were
acquired with the grism 300V, covering the wavelength range
4000−9000 Å. We used a 1′′ slit, resulting in an eﬀective res-
olution of R = 440. The extraction of the spectrum was per-
formed with the ESO-MIDAS software package. Wavelength
and ﬂux calibration of the spectra were achieved using helium-
argon lamp and observing spectrophotometric stars.

A short X−ray observation of XTE J1814−338 was carried
out with the XMM-Newton satellite. Details about the observa-
tion and data analysis are given in Sec. 3.1.

3. XTE J1814−338

3.1. XMM−Newton observations

XTE J1814−338 was discovered in outburst on 2003 June
5 during monitoring of the central Galactic plane with the
RXTE (Markwardt & Swank 2003). The detection of coher-
ent pulsations at frequency of 314.3 Hz (3.2 ms), modu-
lated on an orbital period of 4.3 hr, makes this source the
widest accreting millisecond X–ray pulsar known to date
(Markwardt & Swank 2003; Markwardt et al. 2003b). Many
X−ray bursts were observed from XTE J1814−338 with the
RXTE satellite. Assuming the Eddington limit for the bright-
est of those bursts Strohmayer et al. (2003) obtained a source
distance of 8.0 ± 1.6 kpc. X–ray observations carried out with
the Chandra satellite during outburst led to a precise source po-
sition and showed a featureless X-ray spectrum which is best
ﬁt by an absorbed power law plus blackbody model, where the
equivalent hydrogen column density (NH) is comparable to the
Galactic value (Krauss et al. 2005). An R ∼ 18.3 candidate op-
tical counterpart was identiﬁed within the small Chandra error
box during the outburst and was no longer visible during quies-
cence down to a limiting magnitude R > 23.3 (3σ c.l.; Krauss
et al. 2005). Optical spectroscopy of the candidate carried out
during the outburst revealed prominent hydrogen and helium
emission lines, supporting its association with XTE J1814−338
(Steeghs 2003). An X-ray heated accretion disk model is able
to account for the BVR magnitudes measured during the 2003
outburst but this model is unable to account for the I−band data,
which are systematically brighter than predicted (Krauss et al.
2005). A similar “IR excess” with respect to the X-ray heated
disk model, was observed in the accretion-powered millisec-
ond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 (Wang et al. 2001; Greenhill et
al. 2006) and suggests for both sources a signiﬁcant contribu-
tion from the companion star or from a synchrotron-emitting re-
gion (Wang et al. 2001; Krauss et al. 2005; Greenhill et al. 2006;
Russell et al. 2007). No radio observations of this source have
been reported to date. Using RXTE data taken during outburst,
Papitto et al. (2007) performed a precise timing analysis mea-
suring a spin-down behaviour of the source (˙ν ∼ −7 × 10−14 Hz
s−1) and used this value to estimate a magnetic ﬁeld of 108 − 109
G. No quiescent X–ray observations of this system have been
reported to date.

XMM-Newton observed XTE 1814–338 on Sep. 6 2005 for 41
ks. The observation is plagued by strong proton ﬂares and only 9
ks (pn data) survive after ﬁltering. A faint source can be detected
at the known source position with a signal to noise ratio of 2.6.
The source count rate is (4.9 ± 1.9) × 10−3 c s−1 (1 σ conﬁdence
level). The source is not detected in the MOS1 and MOS2 ex-
posures. Assuming a power law spectrum with Γ = 2 and the
outburst column density (Krauss et al. 2005) we can estimate a
0.5–10 keV unabsorbed ﬂux of ∼ 3 × 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1, con-
verting to a quiescent luminosity of ∼ 2 × 1032 erg s−1 (assuming
a distance from Earth of 8 kpc). Despite that this luminosity is
somewhat higher than what usually observed in AMXPs, we re-
mark that the uncertainties connected to this value are very large
due to the paucity of counts as well as to the spectral parameters.

3.2. Optical counterpart during quiescence

In all our V and R frames we found a point-like object inside the
Chandra error box at the following coordinates (J2000): R.A.
= 18h13m39s.04, Dec = −33◦46′22′′.3 (0.3′′ error). This posi-
tion is coincident with the one of the optical counterpart of XTE
J1814−338 detected by Krauss et al. (2005) during the 2003 out-
burst. The object has V ∼ 23.3 and R ∼ 22.5. A ﬁnding chart is
shown in Fig. 1.

3.3. Optical lightcurve

Once we identiﬁed the candidate, we searched for variability
of this source in each ﬁlter. We performed PSF-photometry of
our candidate and of a selected sample of bright, non-saturated,
isolated stars assumed to be non-variable in all our VR frames.
The result of such diﬀerential photometry is that our source is
variable with a clear sinusoidal modulation at the 4.3 hr or-
bital period with an average semiamplitude of about 0.4 mag
(Fig. 2). This unambiguously identiﬁes the source as the opti-
cal counterpart of XTE J1814−338 and represents the ﬁrst de-
tection at optical wavelengths of this source during quiescence.
In both V and R−band the light curve shows a single minimum

around phase 0, i.e. at superior conjunction (when the neutron
star is behind the companion) and a maximum around phase 0.5
(0.48 ± 0.02 and 0.43 ± 0.02 respectively, based on the precise
X–ray ephemerides of Papitto et al. 2007), likely indicating that
irradiation of the companion star plays a crucial role and it is
reminiscent of the optical light curves of SAX J1808.4−3658
and IGR J00291+5934 during quiescence. All the results of our
phase-resolved multi-band photometry are reported in Table 2.

It is interesting to note that in the V−band light curve, the
points between phases 0.05 - 0.17 are well below the sinusoid
best-ﬁt of the data. We carefully checked the V−band images
used to obtain the measurement, and it seems that they are not
aﬀected by problems (e.g., cosmic rays, spikes, bad pixels). In
addition, the comparison stars are not aﬀected by this decrease.
However, there is no clear evidence of a similar eﬀect in the
corresponding points of the R−band light curve taken contem-
poraneously (Fig. 2). A tentative explanation for this observed
phenomenon will be presented and discussed in Sec. 3.5.

curves for a ﬁeld star of comparable brightness are plotted oﬀset
below (triangles). The residuals of the V−band light curve to the
sinusoid model are shown in the lower panel.

3.4. Optical spectrum

Our spectra of XTE J1814−338 were acquired on the night 2007
Sept. 3, with the FORS1 camera of the ESO-VLT equipped with
the grism 300V, covering the wavelength range 4000−9000 Å.
We calibrated them observing spectrophotometric standard stars
and corrected the ﬂux for interstellar absorption (see Sec. 3.5
for details on reddening correction). We accounted for slit losses
by matching our V and R photometry. With a simple rescaling
(by a factor 1.2) we were able to correct the ﬂux discrepancy
between spectra and photometry, showing that the spectral ﬂux
calibration was robust. We then computed an average of all the
available spectra, in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. In
our averaged spectrum we can clearly detect Hα, Hβ and a pos-
sible HeI λ5875 emission lines, superposed on a blue continuum
(Fig. 3), with equivalent widths of (19.0 ± 1.1) Å, (36.4 ± 3.6)
Å and (9.4 ± 1.2) Å, respectively. These emission lines are also

visible in each single spectrum. Unfortunately, the S/N and the
spectral resolution are not high enough to determine if these lines
have a double-horned proﬁle (the typical signature of an accre-
tion disk) or not.

3.5. Origin of the quiescent optical emission
The X–ray mass function ( fX(M) ∼ 2.0 × 10−3M⊙) computed
by Markwardt et al. (2003b), combined with a neutron star mass
of 1.4 (2.0) M⊙, implies for XTE J1814−338 a minimum com-
panion mass of 0.17 (0.21) M⊙. Based on the harmonic proper-
ties of the burst oscillations, Bhattacharyya et al. (2005) were
able to derive 90% conﬁdence intervals of 26◦ < i < 50◦ for
the inclination of XTE J1814−338. A similar constraint was
derived by Krauss et al. (2005) from the absence of X–ray
eclipses or dips and assuming an absolute magnitude of the sys-
tem during quiescence of MV < 13.2. With these constraints

e.g., Frank et al. 1992). For each possible radius Rc we can thus
derive the binary separation a = (G(MX + Mc)(Porb)2/(4π)2)1/3
which is also a parameter foreseen in the Chakrabarty (1998)
model. We obtain an acceptable ﬁt to all the data (see Fig. 5 and
Table 3), with a reduced χ2 = 0.9 (18 degrees of freedom, n.h.p.
of 58%).
The result of our ﬁt is that the required irradiating luminosity
is Lirr ∼ 1 × 1034 erg s−1. Taking this value as a lower limit
for the spin-down luminosity of a classical rotating magnetic
dipole, we can estimate a neutron star’s magnetic ﬁeld greater

on the system inclination the companion mass should be in the
range (0.2 ≤ M2 ≤ 0.5) M⊙. Information about the compan-
ion mass can also be obtained from our color photometry. To
compute the color of the source we ﬁrst need to correct our
magnitudes for interstellar absorption computed with the rela-
tion NH/E(B − V) = 5.8 × 1021 cm−2 mag−1 (Bohlin et al. 1978)
and assuming NH = (1.67 ± 0.17) × 1021 cm−2 (Krauss et al.
2005). The resulting color excess is E(B − V) = 0.29 ± 0.03
mag. Using a standard extinction curve from Fitzpatrick (1999)
we obtained the reddening parameters for our ﬁlters (Table 2).
We thus computed a mean unabsorbed (V − R) = 0.58 ± 0.09
color and compared it (Fig. 4) with the theoretical mass-color
diagrams computed for solar metallicity low-mass stars reported
in Baraﬀe et al. (1998). The result is that the secondary’s mass
should be 0.8 ≤ Mc ≤ 1.0 M⊙ (1σ c.l.). Using the X−ray mass
function, we can derive for these masses the inclination of the
system 13◦ ≤ i ≤ 15◦. Assuming a uniform a priori distribution
of inclination angles, the inferred inclination would be low, and
therefore improbable (P ∼ 3%). In addition, these inclinations
are at variance with the estimates of Bhattacharyya et al. (2005)
and Krauss et al. (2005) described above.

The discrepancies in the estimate of the companion’s mass
can ﬁnd a natural explanation under the hypothesis that the sec-
ondary star is subjected to strong irradiation from the compact
object, as suggested by the optical light curve. Since during
our observations XTE J1814−338 was in quiescence, we try
to investigate the possible causes of its optical/NIR emission.
Following Campana et al. (2004) and D’Avanzo et al. (2007) we
now attempt to account for the optical spectrum ﬂux (corrected
for interstellar absorption) with the simple model of an irradiated
star with a blackbody spectrum (for the details of the modeling
see Chakrabarty 1998 eqs. [8]−[13]). We ﬁt the data by using
the irradiating luminosity (Lirr), the distance from Earth (D), the
radius of the companion star (Rc) and the albedo of the star (η∗)
as free parameters. To ﬁll the Roche lobe of a 4.3 hr binary sys-
tem, a main-sequence companion star of XTE J1814−338 should
obey the mass-radius relation Rc = 0.28(Mc/0.1M⊙)1/3R⊙ (see,

than 9.7 × 107 Gauss. Such value is in agreement with the es-
timate of Papitto et al. (2007). The required irradiating lumi-
nosity is about two orders of magnitude larger than the qui-
escent X−ray luminosity of XTE J1814−338 (LX ∼ 1032 erg
s−1; see Sec. 3.1). Such discrepancy is reminiscent of that ob-
served for SAX J1808.4−3658 (Burderi et al. 2003; Campana
et al. 2004) and IGR J00291+5934 (D’Avanzo et al. 2007) and
can be explained with the presence in the system of a relativistic
particle wind from an active pulsar which irradiates the com-
panion star. As reported in Table 3, we were able to estimate
Rc = (0.37 ± 0.02) R⊙ and consequently, using the mass-radius
relation reported above, Mc = (0.23 ± 0.08) M⊙. Such values are
typical of a main-sequence M-type star, in agreement with the
estimate made by Krauss et al. (2005) for this system. On the
other hand, the (V − R) color we measured is consistent with
a late G or K-type main-sequence star. In addition, the optical
spectrum of XTE J1814−338 is well ﬁtted with a blackbody with
λmax = (5106 ± 24) Å (Fig. 5), equivalent to a surface tempera-
ture of T ∼ 5675 K (typical of a G-K star). With a typical mass
and radius comparable to the Sun, a G or K star cannot ﬁt the
Roche lobe of a binary system like XTE J1814−338. However,
this discrepancy between the observed spectral type of the com-
panion star and the geometrical limits of the system ﬁnds a natu-
ral explanation if we assume that the relativistic particle wind of
the radio pulsar, which irradiates the companion, would increase
its surface temperature making it appear as an earlier spectral
type star.

The simple model we considered above does not predict the
presence of a residual disk during quiescence. To check for a
more realistic solution we tried to ﬁt our data with the model of
an irradiated star plus a disk by using the irradiating luminosity
(Lirr), the distance from Earth (D), the radius (Rc) and the albedo
of the companion star (η∗) and the internal disk radius (Rin) as
free parameters. We ﬁxed the X−ray albedo of the disk to 0.95
(Chakrabarty 1998). For each possible radius Rin we assumed
an outer disk radius of 0.3a (where a is the binary separation).
We obtained an acceptable solution for values of the ﬁtting pa-
rameters similar to the model of the irradiated star alone (see
Table 3 and Fig. 6). We can provide just an upper limit for the
inner disk radius, given that the reduced χ2 of the ﬁt reaches a
minimum for values of the inner disk radius that go beyond the
level of the neutron star surface. Within the limits of our ﬁt, the
residual accretion disk contributes about 20% to the observed
optical ﬂux8. Such scenario might shed light on the puzzling op-
tical light curve we presented in Sec. 3.2 and in Fig. 2. A possi-
ble way to explain this V ﬂux decrease can be found assuming
that the companion star or an intra-binary shock front (created
by the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind and matter out-
ﬂowing from the companion star and the disk) are eclipsing the
disk. Since the disk is very blue (peaking at λ < 1000 Å ), we
would expect a marked decrease in the V band (∼ 0.2 mag) and
a minor decrease (∼ 0.1) in the R−band9, which might be hid-
den in the error bars of our photometry. As reported in Sec. 3.2,
the eclipse duration is of at least 10% of Porb (unfortunately we
do not have data between orbital phase 0.80 − 1.05). We can
also derive an upper limit of 0.3Porb on the eclipse duration as-
suming that the eclipse proﬁle is symmetric around phase 1.0
(Fig. 2). So, the size of the region producing the eclipse should
be (2πa/Porb)0.1Porb ≤ Re ≤ (2πa/Porb)0.3Porb which means
0.6a <∼ Re <∼ 1.9a, where a = (G(MX + Mc)(Porb)2/(4π)2)1/3
is the binary separation. Using MX = 1.4 M⊙ and Mc = 0.2 M⊙
we obtain 1.0 R⊙ <∼ Re <∼ 3.0 R⊙. This might indicate that the
extended region is producing the eclipse, rather than a compact
feature as also suggested by the broad decrease in the observed
V−band ﬂux. However, if the companion is eclipsing the disk,
the system should be close to edge-on but, as noted by Krauss et
al. (2005), no eclipses or dips are visible in the X−ray light curve
(i < 77◦), weakening the hypothesis of the companion eclipsing
the disk.

Alternatively, as shown in Campana et al. (2004) for SAX
J1808.4-3658, the intra-binary shock front (if present) is ex-
pected to have a blue spectrum, partially contributing to the
whole observed optical ﬂux. If the companion star is eclipsing
this shock front, then the eclipse should be visible also at low-
inclinations, the shock front being spatially close to the compan-
ion star. As in the previous scenario, such an eclipse should be
more marked in the bluer bands, however only the lower limit

8 We also tried to ﬁt our data with a disk model, but we found an
acceptable solution only for large values of the irradiation luminosity
(∼ 1036 erg s−1) and of the disk inner radius (∼ 1010 cm).

9 Assuming that around phase zero the whole contibution of the disk

(∼ 20%) to the observed optical ﬂux is eclipsed.

of our estimate of Re is compatible with the expected size of the
companion star of XTE J1814−338.

Finally, if the companion star is not fully convective (but
see Podiadlovski 1991) and has a temperature gradient between
the hemisphere facing the neutron star and the other one persis-
tently hidden, this can explain the ﬂux decrease without invoking
eclipses.

4. Ultracompact Accreting ms X–ray Pulsars

least

Binary systems with Porb < 80 minutes can be formed
two possible channels as summarized, e.g., by
in at
Deloye & Bildsten (2003). The ﬁrst scenario starts from sta-
ble mass transfer onto a neutron star from an evolved main-
sequence star close to core hydrogen exhaustion (Nelson et al.
1986; Fedorova & Ergma 1989; Podsiadlowski et al. 2002;
Nelson & Rappaport 2003), or a He-burning star (Savonije et al.
1986; Tutukov & Fedorova 1989). According to this scenario,
the system goes through the 40 minute period range twice.
Such a system will initially evolve to orbital periods comparable
to the ultracompact AMXPs and can reach a period minimum
of about 10 minutes. The resulting ultracompact binaries have
donor masses of 0.1 − 0.2 M⊙ as they pass through Porb ∼ 40
minutes on their way toward the minimum period. At this stage,
the donors have masses signiﬁcantly greater with respect to those
measured for the ultracompact AMXPs known to date. However,
systems evolving through Porb ∼ 40 minutes on the way out from
their period minimum have masses of the order of 0.01 M⊙, more
in line with the measurements. By this time the donors have be-
come partially degenerate low-mass, low-luminosity donor stars.
On the contrary, the second channel involves evolution through
the common-envelope phase during an unstable mass transfer
from an intermediate mass (2 − 6 M⊙) to the neutron star. The
donor and the neutron star spiral-in to shorter orbital periods un-
til the envelope is expelled. The remaining core of the donor
could be either an He or C/O white dwarf star with M ∼ 0.01M⊙
(Bildsten 2002; Deloye & Bildsten 2003). The main diﬀerence
between these two evolutionary models is that according to the
ﬁrst one a residual fraction of hydrogen still should be present
in the companion star as the system reaches Porb ∼ 40 minutes.
Since the evolution of these systems is still unknown, a detec-
tion of the companion star will allow us to diﬀerentiate between
these diﬀerent formation scenarios.

4.1. XTE J0929−314

The X−ray transient XTE J0929−314 was discovered by the
All-Sky Monitor (ASM) on the RXTE satellite in 2002 April
(Remillard & Smith 2002). RXTE observations revealed persis-
tent 185.1 Hz (5.4 ms) pulsations and a binary orbital period
of 43.6 minutes. The measured X-ray mass function ( fX(M) =
2.7 × 10−7M⊙) gives a minimum companion mass of Mc =
0.008M⊙ (i = 90◦, MX = 1.4M⊙) and implies Mc ≤ 0.03M⊙
(95% c.l.) for a uniform a priori distribution of inclination an-
gles (Galloway et al. 2002). Chandra observations carried out
during the 2002 outburst showed a featureless X−ray spectrum
(0.5 − 8.3 keV) that is well ﬁtted by a power-law + black-
body model with NH consistent to Galaxy line-of-sight val-
ues (0.8 − 1.0) × 1021 cm−2 (Juett et al. 2003). Variable opti-
cal (Greenhill et al. 2002; Cacella 2002) and radio (Rupen et al.
2002) counterparts were detected during outburst. Optical pho-
tometry performed by Giles et al. (2005) during outburst re-
vealed a sinusoidal modulation probably due to a combination
of emission by a hotspot and an X−ray heated secondary star.

These authors also report the evidence of an excess in the R and
I band in the BVRI broad-band spectrum (similar to what ob-
served in SAX J1808.4−3658 and XTE J1814−338), that may
be due to synchrotron emission in matter ﬂowing out of the sys-
tem. The optical spectrum of XTE J0929−314, carried out dur-
ing outburst, shows a strong feature around 4640 Å, probably
due to C or N emission, and no clear evidence for H/He emis-
sion or absorption lines (Nelemans et al. 2006). During quies-
cence, XTE J0929−314 was barely detected by Chandra in the
0.5−10 keV range. The quiescent X−ray spectrum could be ﬁt-
ted with a simple power-law model and no thermal component
was detected (Wijnands et al. 2005). Deep optical observations
carried out during quiescence led to the detection of a very faint
(R ∼ 27.2) source at a position consistent with the X−ray and
radio error circles (Monelli et al. 2005).

4.1.1. Optical counterpart during quiescence

We averaged all our V, R and I frames in order to obtain a deep
image of the ﬁeld of XTE J0929−314 for each ﬁlter. We found
a faint, point-like object inside the precise radio error circle
(Rupen et al. 2002) at the following coordinates (J2000): R.A. =
09h29m20s.19, Dec = −31◦23′03′′.2 (0.3′′ error). This position
is coincident with the one of the optical counterpart detected by
Giles et al. (2005) during the 2002 outburst (Fig. 7). The source
is not visible in the single VLT frames, and no check for variabil-
ity could be performed. The results of our PSF VRI photometry
are shown in Table 4; we note that we only have a marginal de-
tection of the source but our photometry is in agreement with the
results reported by Monelli et al. (2005).

We can use our detection to evaluate the possible nature of
the optical counterpart of XTE J0929−314 in light of the pos-
sible evolutionary states of ultracompact systems presented in
Sec. 4. Given that the source is detected during quiescence, we
will assume that, if present, the accretion disk contribution is
low with respect to the total observed ﬂux, as discussed for XTE
J1814−338 (Sec. 3.5) and found for other accretion powered
millisecond X–ray pulsars (Campana et al. 2004; D’Avanzo et
al. 2007).

Using a column density 7.6 × 1020 ≤ NH ≤ 1.0 × 1021 cm−2
(Juett et al. 2003) we estimate a color excess of E(B − V) =
0.15±0.02 mag and, assuming for the system a distance of 8 kpc,
we estimated the expected absolute magnitudes of the diﬀer-
ent possible Roche-lobe ﬁlling companion stars and compared
them with our photometry of XTE J0929−314. Following simi-
lar work by Jonker et al. (2003) on the AMXP XTE J1751−305,
we considered, for the evolved main-sequence star scenario, the
post-period-minimum model for XB 1832−330 (M = 0.026M⊙,
R = 0.055R⊙), a binary system with orbital period close to 40
min (Table 1 in Podsiadlowski, Rappaport & Pfahl 2002) and

the helium star donor model reported in Table III in Tutukov &
Fedorova (1989; M = 0.015M⊙, R = 0.046R⊙). For the white-
dwarf scenario, we used the model of Deloye & Bildsten (2003)
which estimates for XTE J0929−314 either a hot C/O star or a
hot He star (M = 0.011M⊙, R = 0.041R⊙ and M = 0.019M⊙,
R = 0.050R⊙, respectively; Figs. 5, 6 in Deloye & Bildsten
2003). In light of the results obtained above for XTE J1814−338
and given the low number of data points, we considered the sim-
ple model of an irradiated star with a blackbody spectrum (for
details of the modeling see Chakrabarty 1998 and Sec. 3.5). As
shown in Fig. 8, we see that for an irradiating luminosity equal
to the X–ray quiescent one (LX ∼ 4.5 × 1031 erg s−1, assum-

ing a distance of 8 kpc; Wijnands et al. 2005) none of the pro-
posed models can account for the observed magnitudes of XTE
J0929−314. To match our photometry, we need an irradiating lu-
minosity higher than about a factor of 8 (Lirr ∼ 3.5 × 1032 erg
s−1). Taking this value as a lower limit for the spin-down lumi-
nosity of a classical rotating magnetic dipole, we can estimate a
lower limit of 1.8 × 108 G for the neutron star’s magnetic ﬁeld
(in agreement with the estimate of Monelli et al. 2005 and the
upper limit of Wijnands et al. 2005).

4.2. XTE J1807−294

XTE J1807−294 was discovered on February 21, 2003 reveal-
ing a frequency of 190.6 Hz (5.3 ms) by the RXTE satel-
lite during a Galactic plane scan (Markwardt et al. 2003a). A
follow-up Chandra observation allowed to obtain a precise po-
sition (1′′ uncertainty, 90% c.l.) and to determine an orbital
periodicity of 40.1 minutes, making it the shortest orbital pe-
riod of all accreting millisecond X–ray pulsars known to date
(Markwardt et al. 2003a). No type I X–ray bursts have been
detected, so the distance of XTE J1807−294 is still unknown.
Campana et al. (2003) observed the source during outburst with
the XMM-Newton satellite at a luminosity level of about 2 × 1036
erg s−1 (0.5 − 10 keV, assuming a distance of 8 kpc) with an
X–ray featureless spectrum well ﬁtted by an absorbed (NH ∼
5 × 1021 cm−2) blackbody plus hard Comptonization model like
COMPTT (Titarchuk 1994). Kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillla-
tions (kHz QPOs) have been detected in the X–ray ﬂux of XTE
J1807−294 during outburst with a frequency separation con-
sistent with the 191 Hz pulse frequency (Linares et al. 2005).
From XMM-Newton outburst observations, Kirsch et al. (2004)
improved the determination of binary orbital parameters and
estimated an X–ray mass function of the system of fX(M) =
1.6 × 10−7M⊙, which implies (assuming a neutron star mass of
1.4 M⊙ and i = 90◦) a minimum companion mass of 0.007 M⊙.
A re-analysis of these data enabled Falanga et al. (2005) to con-
strain the companion mass to Mc < 0.022M⊙, suggesting that
is a very low mass (likely white) dwarf. INTEGRAL observa-
tions of XTE J1807−294 in the 0.5−200 keV carried out during
the 2003 outburst (simultaneously with the XMM-Newton and
RXTE observations) revealed a spectrum consistent with a com-
bination of thermal Comptonization and blackbody, as found at
lower energy by Campana et al. (2003) but with a higher equiva-
lent temperature (Falanga et al. 2005). During quiescence, XTE
J1807−294 was observed with XMM-Newton and the source was

not detected down to a 3σ upper limit of LX < 4 × 1031 erg
s−1 (0.5−10 keV) assuming a distance of 8 kpc (Campana et al.
2005). No detection of the counterpart of the system at other
wavelengths has been reported so far.

4.2.1. A search for the optical counterpart during quiescence

Our VRI J imaging dataset of XTE J1807−294 covers, respec-
tively, about 32%, 32%, 57% and 90% of the 40.1 min orbital
period of the system (see Table 1). An analysis of our VRI
images revealed the presence of a source within the precise
(1′′) Chandra error circle (Fig. 9) at the following coordinates
(J2000): R.A. = 18h06m59s.77, Dec = −29◦24′30′′.1 (0.3′′ er-
ror). As can be seen in Fig. 9, this source is barely visible in
our averaged J−band image, obtained under worse seeing con-
ditions, and no solution can be obtained with aperture or PSF-
photometry in this band. VRI phase resolved PSF-photometry
gave no evidence for variability. The source appears to be almost
constant at a level of V ∼ 22.1 and R ∼ 21.410. If any variability
is present, it should be lower than 0.1 mag. Assuming a column
density NH ∼ 5 × 1021 (Campana et al. 2003) we estimated a
color excess of E(B − V) = 0.79 ± 0.05 mag and compute the
unabsorbed (V − R) = 0.22 ± 0.12 color, typical of an A5-F2
main sequence star.

To further investigate the nature of this source, we obtained
on 2006 Sept. 3 an optical spectrum in the wavelength range
4000−9000 Å. We extracted the spectrum and found no evidence
for Balmer or He emission lines (Fig. 10). The spectrum is al-
most featureless, with the exception of Hα and Hβ absorption
lines, superposed onto a blue continuum, suggesting an early-
type star (in agreement with the results of our color photometry).
The fact that the ﬂux density of the spectrum is a factor of ∼ 5
brighter than our VR photometry (after correcting for interstellar
reddening) shows that it is probably contaminated by a nearby
bright star (star “A” in Fig. 9). Among the possible scenarios of
formation and evolution of ultracompact X–ray binaries that we
have reported in Sec. 4.1, only an evolved main-sequence com-
panion star is supposed to show hydrogen features in its optical
spectrum but they should be detected together with prominent

10 When calibrated with respect to Landolt standard stars, our I−band
magnitudes of the candidate counterpart of XTE J1807−294 appear to
be suspiciously brighter than expected from the extrapolated (V − R)
color. We found that this behaviour is common to other sources in the
ﬁeld and we conclude that our I−band photometry is very likely aﬀected
by some systematic error and, therefore, we report here only our VR
results.

helium lines (Nelemans, Jonker & Steeghs 2006). The detection
of H absorption features together with the non-detection of He
lines in the spectrum of our source and the absence of variability
in the light curve suggests that our candidate is not the quiescent
optical counterpart of XTE J1807−294 but more likely an early-
type main-sequence star. We then used 3σ upper limits of our
photometry (reported in Table 5) to constrain the possible com-
panion star of XTE J1807−294. Assuming a distance of 8 kpc we
converted our VRJ upper limits into absolute magnitudes (Table
5).

As done in Sec. 4.1.1 for XTE J0929−314, we compared the
results of our photometry to a set of spectral energy distribu-
tions computed for the model of an irradiated companion star.
All the models we considered for XTE J0929−314 (Fig. 8) can
be considered valid for XTE J1807−294. In addition, we also
considered the model of a cold C white dwarf (M = 0.011M⊙,
R = 0.041R⊙; Deloye & Bildsten 2003; Falanga et al. 2005).
We assumed an irradiating quiescent X–ray luminosity of about
1 × 1031 erg s−1 (consistent with the non-detection of Campana
et al. 2005) or a spin-down luminosity of 1 × 1034 erg s−1, as
measured for the accretion-powered millisecond X–ray pulsars
XTE J1814−338 (Sec. 3.5), SAX J1808.4−3658 (Campana et al.
2004) and IGR J00291+5934 (D’Avanzo et al. 2007). As shown

4.3. XTE J1751−305

The transient accreting millisecond X–ray pulsar XTE
J1751−305 was discovered on 2002 April during regular mon-
itoring observations of the Galactic bulge region by the RXTE
satellite. The pulsar has a spin frequency of 435.3 Hz (2.3 ms),
a signature of orbital Doppler modulation on an orbital period
of 42.4 minutes; no X–ray eclipses were detected (Markwardt
et al. 2002). The precise determination of the orbital parameters
enabled Markwardt et al. (2002) to derive the X–ray mass func-
tion fX(M) ∼ 1.3 × 10−6M⊙, which implies a minimum mass
for the companion star of 0.013 − 0.017M⊙ depending on the
mass of the neutron star. These authors derived a lower limit
for the distance of the source of 7 kpc, by assuming a mass
transfer rate from the companion equal to the one measured for
SAX J1808.4−3658. XMM-Newton observations carried out dur-
ing the 2002 outburst revealed an X–ray (0.5−10 keV) feature-
less spectrum consistent with a simple absorbed blackbody plus
power-law model with NH = 9.8 ×1021 atoms cm−2 (Miller et al.
2003). Gierli´nski & Poutanen (2005) presented the results of an
extensive study of all the X–ray data of XTE J1751−305 taken
with the RXTE and XMM-Newton satellites during its 2002 out-
burst. These authors show that the broad X–ray spectrum of
XTE J1751−305 can be ﬁtted with a model of two soft compo-
nents (which originate from a cool accretion disk and a hot-spot
on the neutron star surface) and a hard component due to ther-
mal Comptonization in a shocked region in the accretion col-
umn. During quiescence, XTE J1751−305 was observed with
Chandra and was not detected down to a 0.5 − 10 keV luminos-

4.3.1. Constraints on the optical counterpart

The X–ray observations of XTE J1751−305 place some strong
constraints on the geometry of its companion star. The non-
detection of X–ray eclipses or dips and the assumption that the
mass transfer is driven by gravitational radiation (Markwardt
et al. 2002) constrain the orbital inclination to be in the range
30◦ − 85◦ and the companion mass to be 0.013 − 0.035M⊙.
Nelson & Rappaport (2003) computed a model for the evolu-
tion of a main-sequence, hydrogen-rich companion star of XTE
J1751−305 that can evolve to the observed short period of about
42 minutes. According to this model, the current companion star
should be a low-mass, low-luminosity non-degenerate star with
a residual fraction of hydrogen. An alternative scenario is pre-
sented by Deloye and Bildsten (2003) and foresees a hot white
dwarf companion with an evolved (He, C/O) composition. The
detection (e.g. via optical spectroscopy) of hydrogen would thus
be a key discriminant for determining the validity of these mod-
els. Unfortunately, there are no detections of the optical counter-
part of XTE J1751−305 to date, nor in outburst or in quiescence.
An observational campaign at optical and NIR bands placed up-
per limits on the presence of a star at the precise Chandra posi-
tion of XTE J1751−305 (Jonker et al. 2003).

We used 3σ upper limits of the Jonker et al. (2003) photom-
etry (reported in Table 6) to constrain the possible companion
star of XTE J1751−305 and converted them into absolute magni-
tudes assuming a source distance of 8 kpc (Table 5). Following
the procedure discussed in Sec. 4.1.1 for XTE J0929−314, we
compared the results of Jonker et al. (2003) photometry to dif-
ferent models of an irradiated companion star. All the models
we have considered for XTE J0929−314 (Fig. 8) can be consid-
ered valid also for XTE J1751−305. We assumed an irradiating
quiescent X–ray luminosity of about 1 × 1031 erg s−1 (consistent
with the non-detection of Wijnands et al. 2005) and a spin-down
luminosity of 1 × 1034 erg s−1 erg s−1. As shown in Fig. 12,
these limits are not deep enough to constrain any of the pro-
posed models for the companion star of this system, even for a
high irradiating luminosity value.

5. Discussion and Conclusions

We have presented an extensive study of the optical counter-
parts of Accreting Millisecond X–ray Pulsars during quiescence.
The results of our observational campaigns (also presented in
Campana et al. 2004 and D’Avanzo et al. 2007), together with

data collected from public archives, provided the ﬁrst compre-
hensive optical study of the AMXPs class during quiescence. As
we discussed in Sec. 1, the eight accreting millisecond X–ray
pulsars known to date can be divided into two subclasses using
the orbital period as a discriminant parameter: compact (Porb > 1
hr) and ultracompact (Porb < 1 hr) systems. The compactness of
these systems implies very low-mass companion stars as inferred
from the measured X–ray mass functions. So, it is reasonable to
foresee a very low optical luminosity during quiescence, when
the main contribution to the total optical ﬂux is expected to come
from the companion star. On the other hand, in such narrow sys-
tems, irradiation from the compact object might play a key role
in the observed luminosity, by heating the inner face of the com-
panion star (this energy is then redistributed through the star;
Podsiadlowski 1991). We reported the ﬁrst detection of the qui-
escent optical/NIR counterparts of XTE J1814−338 (Sec. 3.2).
Phase resolved photometry of this source revealed a highly sinu-
soidal optical light curve, modulated at the orbital period with a
minimum when the neutron star is seen behind the companion,
with respect to the observer. This behaviour, reminiscent of what
observed for SAX J1808.4−3658 (Homer et al. 2001; Campana
et al. 2004) and IGR J00291+5934 (D’Avanzo et al. 2007), sug-
gests a companion star heated by the compact object. This is at
variance with the “classical” ellipsoidal modulation observed in
wider LMXTs. The irradiating luminosity required to account
for the observed optical ﬂux is in all cases at least one order of
magnitude greater than the observed quiescent X–ray luminos-
ity. An explanation for this observed “optical excess” could be
found if we assume that these systems host an active millisec-
ond radio pulsar. According to the standard model of formation
of millisecond pulsars these neutron stars have been recycled in
interacting low-mass X-ray binaries, i.e. have been spun up by
accretion after substantial decay of their surface magnetic ﬁelds.
During quiescence (i.e. when the accretion rate onto the neutron
star drops by orders of magnitude or even stops) the radio pulsar

may turn on and start to lose rotational energy in the form of a
relativistic particle wind that can irradiate the companion star.
This wind eventually can be stopped by the pressure of the ma-
terial ﬂowing from the companion star generating a shock front.
The presence of such an extended feature may eclipse the light
coming from a residual accretion disk (if present during qui-
escence), providing an explanation for the puzzling behaviour
of the V−band light curve of XTE J1814−338 we presented in
Fig. 2 and discussed in Sec. 3.5.

As for the compact AMXP systems, the detection of the ob-
served optical ﬂux during quiescence of the ultracompact system
XTE J0929−314 can be accounted for only by invoking an irra-
diating luminosity about one order of magnitude greater than the
quiescent X–ray luminosity (Fig. 8). Taking our estimates of the
irradiating luminosity as a lower limit for the spin-down lumi-
nosity of a classical rotating magnetic dipole, we could estimate
the neutron star’s magnetic ﬁeld for both systems. The derived
limits are in agreement with the standard scenario of weakly
magnetized (107 − 108 G) neutron stars to be the progenitors of
millisecond radio pulsars (Sec. 3.5 and 4.1.1). We note that no
radio pulsations were detected from XTE J0929−314 during qui-
escence. Beaming factor and intrinsic low radio luminosity were
suggested as the most likely explanations for this non-detection
(Iacolina et al. 2009). XTE J1751−305 and XTE J1807−294 lie
both on the Galactic plane and are therefore heavily absorbed
(we estimated AV ∼ 5.2 mag and AV ∼ 2.4 mag, respectively).
Even assuming a high spin-down luminosity (Lirr = 1 × 1034 erg
s−1), the upper limits of the photometry are consistent with a non
detection of the quiescent optical counterpart.

As we discussed in Sec. 4, there are two main basic and
competing scenarios for the formation of ultracompact binary
systems. The ﬁrst involves an evolved main-sequence or a He-
burning companion star (both with a residual presence of hydro-
gen) while the second predicts for the presence of a He or C/O
white dwarf. We note that according to both scenarios the com-
panion star of these ultracompact systems should be a very low-
mass (Mc ∼ 0.01 M⊙) low-luminosity star. As shown in Figures
7, 10 and 11, with our data we cannot constrain any of the evolu-
tionary models for ultracompact binary systems. However, as we
reported in Sec. 4, the detection of hydrogen from one of these
systems would be a key discriminant in determining the validity
of the ﬁrst scenario (which involves an evolved main-sequence
or a He-burning star) with respect to the second one (white dwarf
companion). Optical spectroscopy of XTE J0929−314 carried
out during outburst did not reveal any clear evidence of hydro-
gen or helium lines (Nelemans, Jonker and Steeghs 2006). In
addition, we note that, at variance with what is observed for all
the compact systems, none of the ultracompact AMXPs showed
Type-I X–ray bursts. These events originate from explosive nu-
clear ignition on the surface of neutron stars. At a critical point,
degenerate hydrogen and/or helium burning ignites explosively,
suddenly heating up the entire surface, enough to emit strong X-
rays (Maraschi & Cavaliere 1977; Woosley & Taam 1976). The
absence of Type-I bursts among ultracompact AMXPs ﬁnds a
natural explanation if we assume that there is no hydrogen and/or
He left in the donor star, as expected in the case of a C/O white
dwarf companion star, suggesting that the other evolutionary
channel for these systens is not populated.

With quiescent unabsorbed magnitude in the range R ∼
22−23, compact AMXPs are well within the spectroscopic capa-
bilities of telescopes of the 8-meter class. An estimate of the ra-
dial velocity of the companion star can lead to a determination of
the optical mass function and, consequently, to place constraints
on the mass of the two stars. Firm upper limits on the neutron
