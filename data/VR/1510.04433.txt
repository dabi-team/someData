ABSTRACT
We present a study of the recently discovered compact stellar system Triangulum II. From obser-
vations conducted with the DEIMOS spectrograph on Keck II, we obtained spectra for 13 member
stars that follow the CMD features of this very faint stellar system and include two bright red giant

branch stars. Tri II has a very negative radial velocity (hvri = −383.7+3.0

data set, there is evidence that Tri II has complex internal kinematics. Its radial velocity dispersion

we measure an average metallicity h[Fe/H]i = −2.6 ± 0.2, placing Tri II among the most metal-poor
Milky Way dwarf galaxies. In addition, the spectra of the fainter member stars exhibit diﬀerences
in their line-widths that could be the indication of a metallicity dispersion in the system. All these
properties paint a complex picture for Tri II, whose nature and current state are largely speculative.
The inferred metallicity properties of the system however lead us to favor a scenario in which Tri II
is a dwarf galaxy that is either disrupting or embedded in a stellar stream.

1. INTRODUCTION
A large number of faint and small stellar systems
have been uncovered over the last decade thanks to
wide photometric surveys. The harvest of such ob-
jects, which started with Willman 1 (Willman et al.
2005) and then Segue 1 (Belokurov et al. 2007), blos-
somed through systematic searches of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS; Belokurov et al. 2009) and, more re-
cently, of the Dark Energy Survey (DES; Bechtol et al.
2015; Drlica-Wagner et al. 2015; Koposov et al. 2015)
and the Panoramic Telescope and Rapid Response Sys-
tem 1 (Pan-STARRS1; Laevens et al. 2015b,a). The
photometric properties of many of these systems am-
biguously locate them in a region of parameter space
where dwarf galaxies appear to mix with globular clus-
ters (Gilmore et al. 2007). Spectroscopic studies of their
stars are therefore unavoidable to show that they are

either dynamically cold and display no metallicity dis-
persion (e.g., Laevens 1; Kirby et al. 2015), as expected
for globular clusters, or that they are dynamically hot
(e.g., Segue 1; Geha et al. 2009), have a metallicity dis-
persion (e.g., Segue 2; Kirby et al. 2013a), and/or lie
on the luminosity–metallicity relation followed by dwarf
galaxies (e.g., Hydra II and Draco II; Kirby et al. 2015;
Martin et al. 2015).

Although they are expected by the dozen in simula-
tions (Tollerud et al. 2008; Bullock et al. 2010), only a
handful of these faint and small stellar systems have
so far been conﬁrmed as dwarf galaxies. Any new
addition to the list is particularly valuable as these
objects are among the most promising for the indi-
rect detection of the elusive dark matter particle (e.g.,
Geringer-Sameth et al. 2015). Their small baryonic com-
ponent (L ∼ 102−4 L⊙) makes them hard to ﬁnd and
study but, at the same time, gives powerful insight into
the interplay of physical processes that drive galaxy for-
mation at low masses and in shallow potential wells. The
characterization of these systems is, however, made dif-
ﬁcult by the potential presence of binary stars that can
signiﬁcantly inﬂate the intrinsic velocity dispersion of a
system with a velocity dispersion of only a few km s−1
(McConnachie & Cˆot´e 2010). In addition, the usual as-
sumption of dynamical equilibrium can be inappropri-
ate for systems that are often found within ∼ 40 kpc of
the Galactic center, further impeding their study (e.g.,
Willman 1; Willman et al. 2011). Finally, the diﬃculty
to disentangle member stars from foreground contami-
nation can sometimes further compound the analysis of
these faint objects (e.g., Bonnivard et al. 2015).

In this paper, we report a spectroscopic study of
the Triangulum II (Tri II) stellar system discovered by
Laevens et al. (2015b) in Pan-STARRS1 and conﬁrmed
with deep Large Binocular Camera (LBC) photometry.

Tri II is very faint (MV = −1.8 ± 0.5), fairly compact
(rh = 34+9
−8 pc), and located at 30 ± 2 kpc from the Sun,
or 36 ± 2 kpc from the Galactic center. So far as one can
infer from the photometry, it appears to contain only old
and metal-poor stars.

We present the Keck II/DEIMOS data used for the
analysis in section 2 of this paper, the results of the spec-
troscopic study in section 3, while section 4 is devoted to
a discussion on our ﬁndings.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA
Two masks targeting Tri II potential member stars
were observed during the night of September 17, 2015,
with the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph
(DEIMOS) on Keck II (Faber et al. 2003) under reason-
ably good conditions (0.7–1.0” seeing and ∼ 60% hu-
midity; PI: Rich, program ID: 2015B U064D). The LBC
photometry used by Laevens et al. (2015b) to conﬁrm
the discovery of the satellite were used to place slits on
stars selected in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to
follow the system’s main sequence turn oﬀ (MSTO), sub-
giant branch (SGB), and red giant branch (RGB). The
selection was purposefully tight around the sharp MSTO
and loose around the RGB region that cannot be selected
out of the MW foreground contamination from the pho-
tometry alone.

(CaT) region we focus on. The full spectra cover the

range 6600–9400
A. Raw frames are processed through
our own pipeline, which we developed over the years to
speciﬁcally reduce DEIMOS spectra. We refer the reader
to Ibata et al. (2011) for an overview of the details of
the processing, and the results of using the pipeline on
high quality data. Brieﬂy, the reduction method cali-
brates each pixel of the original spectroscopic frame in
both wavelength and spatial position on the sky. In this
way the data retain their original pixel binning, and one
avoids introducing the correlated noise that occurs when
spectra are extracted and co-added. The wavelength so-
lution is given by a ﬁt to arc-lamp frames taken immedi-
ately after the science frames. We also allow for a wave-
length re-calibration using the Fraunhofer A band in the

◦
range 7595–7630
A in order to perform small telluric cor-
rections when the signal to noise of the spectra is suﬃ-
cient. A two-dimensional sky spectrum model is built for
each slitlet following a procedure inspired by the method
of Kelson (2003). Finally, the radial velocity (and corre-
sponding uncertainty) of the target stars is measured by
ﬁtting a simple Gaussian model of the Ca II triplet lines
to the pixel data minus the sky spectrum. Only stars
with large enough signal-to-noise (S/N > 3 per pixel)
and velocity uncertainties lower than 15 km s−1 are kept
for the analysis, leaving a total sample of 50 stars.

Velocity uncertainties measured by the pipeline are
known not to fully account for low level systematics. Fol-
lowing Ibata et al. (2011), we add an uncertainty ﬂoor of
2.25 km s−1 in quadrature to the velocity uncertainties
measured directly from the spectra. Finally, we mea-
sure the equivalent widths of the CaT lines and their

the spectroscopic sample stars are listed below in Table 2.

troscopic sample. The velocity peak of Tri II stars is visible at
vr ∼ −385 km s−1, separated from the MW contamination with
vr > −300 km s−1. The orange line displays the best ﬁt to the
velocity distribution of Tri II stars, convolved by the median ve-
locity uncertainty. Bottom: Pdfs of the systemic velocity (left)
and velocity dispersion (right) of the full Tri II sample (black his-
tograms). The blue and red histograms correspond to the pdfs for
the inner and outer half of the sample, respectively. The vertical
lines indicate the modes of the distributions. Note the discrepant
velocity dispersion pdfs for the inner and outer samples.

Stars with good quality spectra are displayed in Fig-
ure 1 over the CMD of Tri II in the left-hand panel and
over the spatial distribution of possible Tri II stars in
the right-hand panel. A group of stars with highly neg-
ative velocities, shown in dark-blue, is almost perfectly
aligned with the favored old and metal-poor isochrone of
Laevens et al. (2015b, 13 Gyr and [Fe/H] = −2.2). Most
of these stars are MSTO or SGB stars but the sample
also contains 2 RGB stars that shall prove valuable to
derive the metallicity of Tri II. A large fraction of the
stars with very negative velocities is also concentrated
within the half-light radius of Tri II represented by the
blue ellipse, even though some member stars are also lo-
cated beyond and throughout the region covered by the
DEIMOS masks.

The velocity distribution of the sample stars shown in
the top panel of Figure 2 reveals the velocity peak pro-
duced by Tri II stars. Located around vr ∼ −385 km s−1,
it appears completely isolated from the MW foreground
contamination and conﬁrms that all the stars shown
in dark blue in Figure 1 are member stars. The ve-
locity peak is also surprisingly wide. Fitting a Gaus-
sian distribution to the 13 member stars corroborates
this ﬁrst impression as we infer a velocity dispersion of
−2.2 km s−1 around a systemic velocity of hvri =
σvr = 9.9+3.2
−3.3 km s−1 (see the bottom panels of Figure 2
−383.7+3.0
for the parameters’ probability distribution functions or
pdfs). Such a value is at odds with velocity disper-
sion measurements usually obtained in similarly faint and
compact MW systems. Recent studies consistently infer
values of, at most, a few km s−1 (Martin et al. 2007a;
Simon & Geha 2007; Geha et al. 2009; Willman et al.
2011; Kirby et al. 2013b, 2015; Martin et al. 2015).

Figure 3 shows, however, that the radial velocities of
member stars appear to ﬂare up with distance from the

center of the system. The central half of the sample
is much more closely aligned in velocity than its outer
half. Fitting the velocity distribution for the 6 mem-

ber stars within 2′ yields hvri = −379.8+2.1
−2.0 km s−1, whereas the outermost 7 stars yield
σvr = 4.4+2.8
−4.2 km s−1.
−6.3 km s−1 and σvr = 14.1+5.8
hvri = −387.3+5.7
While the systemic velocities of the inner and outer sam-
ples are compatible, this is hardly the case for the velocity
dispersion measurements (see pdfs in the bottom panels
of Figure 2). Although we cannot completely rule out
the compatibility of the two measurements inferred from
a small number of stars in both samples, we ﬁnd that the
velocity dispersions are nevertheless discrepant at the 2σ
level, conﬁrming the visual impression from Figure 3.

The large velocity dispersion of the outer sample is
robust to the velocity uncertainties as it remains present,
even if we increase the uncertainty ﬂoor to the unlikely
value of 4 km s−1. We also checked for the presence of
a velocity gradient as a function of position that could
artiﬁcially give the impression of the ﬂaring from stars
with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent velocities on opposite sides of
the system. No such gradient was found in the data.

3.2. Metallicities
Two of the observed member stars (stars 40 & 46 in
Table 2) are RGB stars bright enough to allow for a deter-
mination of their [Fe/H] metallicity via a measure of the
equivalent widths of the CaT lines. Starkenburg et al.
(2010) has calibrated the relation between the equiva-
lent widths of the second and third Caii lines, EW2+3,
down to very low metallicities (−4.0 < [Fe/H] < −0.5).
We ﬁrst convert the iP1 magnitudes of the two stars to Ic
magnitudes with the Tonry et al. (2012) color equation
and, using the Starkenburg et al. (2010) relation, we cal-
culate [Fe/H] = −2.6 ± 0.1 for both RGB stars. These
very low metallicity values are conﬁrmed by the inspec-
tion of the spectra (top two panels of Figure 4) that
both exhibit very weak CaT lines. Assuming a Gaussian
metallicity distribution function, we infer a mean metal-
licity h[Fe/H]i = −2.6 ± 0.2 for Tri II, which is therefore
among the most metal-poor MW satellites.

N. F. Martin et al.

Blindly applying the Starkenburg et al. (2010) relation
for these stars that are fainter than the magnitude range
over which it was calibrated11 yields tentative metallici-
ties of [Fe/H] = −2.3 ± 0.2, −3.0 ± 0.6, and −0.7 ± 0.2,
respectively. From the 5 brightest conﬁrmed Tri II mem-
bers, we infer h[Fe/H]i = −2.2+0.4
−0.3 and a large metallicity
dispersion of ∼ 0.8 dex. We nevertheless stress that di-
rect [Fe/H] measurements are needed from higher S/N
spectra to bolster this marginal conclusion.

4. DISCUSSION
We obtained spectra for 13 member stars in the very
faint MW satellite Tri II. These stars follow the CMD
features of the stellar system and include mainly MSTO
and SGB stars, as well as two bright RGB stars. With
−3.3 km s−1, Tri II has a very negative ra-
hvri = −383.7+3.0
dial velocity that translates to hvr,gsri ≃ −264 km s−1.
We have further shown that, as far as we can tell from
only 13 member stars, the internal kinematics of Tri II
appear complex with evidence for a radial velocity dis-

persion increase from 4.4+2.8
−4.2 km s−1 outwards. The velocity dispersion of the
14.1+5.8

full sample is inferred to be σvr = 9.9+3.2
nally, the two bright RGB member stars are both mea-
sured to have [Fe/H] = −2.6 ± 0.1 and point to Tri II be-
ing among the most metal-poor MW satellites. The spec-
tra of fainter member stars exhibit diﬀerences in their
line-widths that could be due to a metallicity dispersion
in the system.

At the distance of Tri II (36 ± 2 kpc from the Galac-
tic center), such a fast infalling velocity is not un-
expected for a satellite bound to the MW. It does,
however, rule out any association with the numer-
ous stellar structures found nearby in the Milky Way
halo.
TriAnd (Rocha-Pinto et al. 2004), TriAnd 2
(Martin et al. 2007b), or the PAndAS MW stream
(Martin et al. 2014) all have positive vr,gsr (Deason et al.
2014). Tri II is also unrelated to the Segue 2 satellite that
is located only ∼ 10 kpc away but has a very diﬀerent ve-
locity (hvri = −39.2 ± 2.5 km s−1; Belokurov et al. 2009).
But what is the nature of Tri II? Taken at face
value, the large global velocity dispersion, the very low-
metallicity, and the potential metallicity dispersion seem
to point towards Tri II being a dwarf galaxy rather than
a globular cluster. However, the complex kinematics of
the system question the assumption of dynamical equi-
librium that is required to translate a large velocity dis-
persion into a large mass and mass-to-light ratio.

Can [Fe/H] discriminate between globular cluster and
dwarf galaxy?
Irrespective of its velocity dispersion,
Tri II is among the most metal-poor systems known.
No globular cluster is known with a metallicity below
[Fe/H] = −2.4 (Harris 1996) and only the Segue 1,
Bootes II, and Reticulum II dwarf galaxies, with whom
Tri II shares many similar properties (total luminosity,
size, distance), are as metal-poor with [Fe/H] = −2.7 ±
0.4 (Norris et al. 2010) or [Fe/H] ∼ −2.5 (Simon et al.
2011) for Segue 1, [Fe/H] = −2.9 ± 0.2 (Koch & Rich
2014) for Bootes II, and [Fe/H] = −2.65 ± 0.07

11 However, see Leaman et al. (2013) and their study of the
metal-poor globular cluster M15 for which the calibration is shown
to hold ∼ 2 magnitudes below this system’s horizontal branch.

Figure 4. Smoothed spectra of two Tri II RGB (top) and three
lower-RGB/SGB member stars in the region around the CaT. The
spectra are smoothed with a 3-pixel boxcar ﬁlter. The proper-
ties of the stars are listed in each panel. Note the weak lines
of the two RGB stars and the varying lines widths of the three
lower-RGB/SGB stars that share similar photometric properties,
indicating a potential metallicity dispersion in the system.

It is harder to provide a deﬁnite conclusion on the pres-
ence or absence of a metallicity dispersion in Tri II since
two stars alone cannot rule out the presence of a disper-
sion, even if they are measured to have the same metal-
licity. Moreover, the other observed member stars are lo-
cated far below the horizontal branch of the system and
the horizontal branch marks the faint limit to which the
Starkenburg et al. (2010) relation has been calibrated.
Finally, directly extracting a measure of Fe line strengths
< 10 is fraught with
from DEIMOS spectra with S/N ∼
peril.

We note however that the three Tri II stars above
the SGB that have similar colors (gP1 − iP1 ∼ 0.65),
magnitudes (iP1 ∼ 20.1), and signal-to-noise (S/N ∼
10), have inconsistent equivalent widths with EW2+3 =

show strong Nai doublet lines (8183 and 8192

would indicate that they are foreground contaminants.
These EW2+3 diﬀerences are directly visible on the spec-
tra (lower three panels of Figure 4) and could be inter-
preted as evidence of a metallicity dispersion in Tri II.

versus luminosity plane. Large black points correspond to MW
dwarf galaxies, as listed in Kirby et al. (2013b), supplemented by
Norris et al. (2010), Kirby et al. (2015), and Simon et al. (2015).
MW globular clusters are shown as small black dots (Harris 1996).
The red squares corresponds to the Tri II measurements, with the
ﬁlled square representing the inference from the two robust indi-
vidual stellar metallicities (stars 40 and 46) while the hollow circle
corresponds to the inference from the 5 stars shown in Figure 4 (the
two Tri II points have been slightly oﬀset from each other along
the luminosity axis so their error bars do not overlap). Both mea-
surements compare well with those of other MW dwarf galaxies.

(Simon et al. 2015) or [Fe/H] = −2.6 ± 0.3 (Walker et al.
2015) for Reticulum II. Figure 5 shows that Tri II is in
agreement with the dwarf galaxy metallicity–luminosity
relation of Kirby et al. (2013b), even if we include the 3
stars with tentative metallicity measurements for the in-
ference of the mean metallicity (hollow red square). By
analogy, the metallicity of the system therefore appears
to favor the dwarf galaxy hypothesis, which would be bol-
stered further by the marginal evidence of a metallicity
dispersion.

What is the dynamical mass of Tri II? It is hard
to tell if one takes the increase in the velocity disper-
sion with radius as a sign that the system is out of
equilibrium. On the other hand, if one assumes that
the change in σvr is an (unlikely 2σ) statistical ﬂuctua-
tion and that the global velocity dispersion measured at
−2.2 km s−1 is representative of the true prop-
σvr = 9.9+3.2
erties of Tri II, one can easily note that it is a signiﬁcant
outlier among other dwarf galaxies of this size, as dis-
played in Figure 6. Equation (1) of Wolf et al. (2010),
relates the mass within the 3-dimensional half-light ra-
dius, M1/2, to the half-light radius and velocity disper-
sion of a bound system in equilibrium and, in the case of
Tri II, yields M1/2 ∼ 3 × 106 M⊙ and (M/L)1/2 ∼ 15 500
in Solar units. It would mean that Tri II is almost an
order of magnitude more massive than Segue 1 or Retic-
ulum II and, by a wide margin, the most dark matter
system known in the universe. Such a large mass seems
very improbable.

Could MW contaminants pollute the velocity peak?
This also appears unlikely as the inﬂated velocity dis-
persion in the outskirts of Tri II is not driven by any
single outlier (see Figure 3). The very negative systemic
velocity of Tri II also means it is improbable for the spec-
troscopic data set to contain more than a single contam-
inating halo star, if any.

Figure 6. Distribution of MW dwarf galaxies in the rh–σvr plane,
compared to the Local Group dwarf galaxy mass proﬁles. The
black dashed and dot-dashed lines correspond to the favored Local
Group mass proﬁles of Collins et al. (2014) for a cored or NFW
model, respectively, and the gray bands represent the model dis-
persions determined by these authors. Black points correspond
to Milky Way dwarf galaxies, as listed in McConnachie (2012),
Kirby et al. (2015), Martin et al. (2015), and Simon et al. (2015).
The Tri II data point is shown as a hollow square for the global
kinematics determined in this paper, or as a ﬁlled square when
using the kinematics of the inner sample. The former is a strong
outlier whereas the latter ﬁts well with other MW dwarf galaxies.
The two Tri II points have been slightly oﬀset from each other
along the rh axis so their error bars do not overlap.

Is Tri II disrupting and/or embedded in a stellar
stream? After ruling out that Tri II is in equilibrium
or contaminated by MW halo stars, the most likely hy-
pothesis is that the observed increase in the velocity dis-
persion with radius is genuine. The large velocity dis-
persion beyond 2′ would then be produced by stars that
are not bound to the body of the satellite. This seems at
odds with the current measure of the half-light radius of
′; Laevens et al. 2015b), but this mea-
Tri II (rh = 3.9+1.1

sure could be systematically biased by the comparatively
small LBC ﬁeld of view (Mu˜noz et al. 2012). In fact, the
spatial distribution of possible satellite member stars ex-
hibits what could be a more compact central core within
∼ 2′ surrounded by a more diﬀuse component (see the
right-hand panel of Figure 1 from Laevens et al. 2015b).
Upcoming wider and deeper photometric data will allow
us to robustly investigate this morphology.

If this ∼ 2′ core really is the true extent of the
main body of Tri II, the velocity dispersion we mea-
sure from the inner half of the spectroscopic sample
−2.0 km s−1) would be more representative of
(σvr = 4.4+2.8
the satellite’s intrinsic properties and would yield a con-
sistent picture with the very faint dwarf galaxies Segue 1
(Simon et al. 2011), Reticulum II (Simon et al. 2015;
Walker et al. 2015), or Draco II (Martin et al. 2015), as
can be seen in Figure 6. The only conundrum would then
be whether Tri II is disrupted by tidal interactions with
the Milky Way, or if it is in equilibrium but embedded
in a stellar stream. Such a stellar stream could, for in-
stance, be produced by a potentially more massive dwarf
galaxy it would have been a satellite of in the past (e.g.,
Wheeler et al. 2015). The large negative velocity of the
system however likely rules out a system that has just

now been tidally disrupted after a pericentric passage.
The fact that the star with the most discrepant spec-
trum among those shown in Figure 4 (star 31) is also
the only one beyond 2′ could point towards the latter
hypothesis but this is hardly conclusive.

At the moment, the puzzling properties of Tri II mean
that its nature and current state are largely speculative.
We favor the scenario in which Tri II is a dwarf galaxy
that is either disrupting or embedded in a stellar stream
but cannot completely rule out that it could be a dis-
rupting globular cluster. Whatever the true nature of
the satellite, it exhibits unexpected properties that make
it very exciting and call for more observations to under-
stand its complexity.
