Fig. 1. 360Roam is a system for immersive 6-DoF roaming in the indoor scenarios. It takes 360◦ images as input to learn geometry-aware omnidirectional
radiance fields which consist of plentiful adaptive-assigned neural perceptrons (illustrated as different colors in the middle figure). It can render novel-view
images at real-time speed on a single GPU GTX1080. The system also outputs the floorplan of the observed scene to enhance immersion for VR applications.

Neural radiance field (NeRF) has recently achieved impressive results in
novel view synthesis. However, previous works on NeRF mainly focus on
object-centric scenarios. In this work, we propose 360Roam, a novel scene-
level NeRF system that can synthesize images of large-scale indoor scenes
in real time and support VR roaming. Our system first builds an omnidi-
rectional neural radiance field (360NeRF) from multiple input 360◦ images.
Using 360NeRF, we then progressively estimate a 3D probabilistic occupancy
map which represents the scene geometry in the form of spacial density.
Skipping empty spaces and upsampling occupied voxels essentially allows
us to accelerate volume rendering by using 360NeRF in a geometry-aware
fashion. Furthermore, we use an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy to
slim and fine-tune the radiance fields for further improvement. The floor-
plan of the scene extracted from the occupancy map can provide guidance
for ray sampling and facilitate a realistic roaming experience. To show the
efficacy of our system, we collect a 360◦ image dataset in a large variety
of scenes and conduct extensive experiments. Quantitative and qualitative
comparisons among baselines illustrated our predominant performance in
novel view synthesis for complex indoor scenes.

INTRODUCTION

1
Recently neural rendering has attracted great attention and demon-
strated impressive rendering quality. Such learned view synthesis
methods exploit neural networks to implicitly represent the struc-
ture and appearance of captured objects. The neural radiance field,
pioneered by NeRF [Mildenhall et al. 2020] is currently the most
promising path. Instead of pursuing precise geometry reconstruc-
tion, NeRF utilizes volume rendering techniques and multi-layer
perceptrons to regress density and view-dependent color per ray.
By densely sampling along each ray, it can generate photorealistic
results even when encountered with light reflection, transparent
objects, and thin structures. To reduce the long training and infer-
ence time, the following NeRF-based methods [Barron et al. 2021;
Liu et al. 2020; Pumarola et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2020] have made
great efforts and modifications to increase rendering quality and
speed. However, most of them focus on object-centric or small-scale
scenes where placements of cameras are constrained during the

training and inference phases. GSN [DeVries et al. 2021] attempts
to improve the limited performance of NeRF in open environments
by introducing generative adversarial networks for scene-level radi-
ance fields. Although it supports a four-degree-of-freedom (4-DoF)
motion, the walk-though artifacts are noticeable, and the resolution
of rendered images is too low.

In this work, we seek to explore the potential of neural radiance
fields from object-centric scenarios into more challenging situations
of complex indoor scene synthesis. Furthermore, we target real-
time performance that will be essential for immersive applications
such as VR roaming. Considering that the consumer-level 360◦
camera is becoming more and more accessible, we propose 360Roam,
an immersive roaming system that takes panorama sequences of
complex scenes as input, generates high quality novel 360◦ images
at real-time speed, and allows roaming with 6-DoF motion (Fig. 1).
360Roam consists of three stages following a coarse-to-fine pro-
cess. First, a 360◦ neural radiance field (360NeRF) for the whole space
is learned from all the input panoramas. Second, we use 360NeRF
to generate panoramic depth and uncertainty of the scene simul-
taneously, and then progressively update the occupied probability.
This gives us a reliable occupancy map while reducing the reliance
on unreliable hyperparameters (e.g., given the scene boundary). We
further recover the floorplan (with objects) from the occupancy map.
The floorplan enables collision detection and hence a more realistic
indoor roaming, i.e., stops the camera from passing through the
objects. More importantly, the geometric information effectively
constrains the sampling range of the ray which allows us to slim a
neural radiance field into numbers of sub-fields and fine-tune the ra-
diance fields by skipping empty spaces and upsampling on occupied
volume in the last stage. This geometry-aware radiance field essen-
tially extends the render accelerating strategy from KiloNeRF [Reiser
et al. 2021] to be scene-level and support adaptive radiance fields de-
composing without manual intervention. See Fig. 2 for an overview
of 360Roam. To summarize, our contributions include:

• Proposing 360Roam, an effective system for real-time 360◦

indoor-scene roaming that achieves 6-DoF flexibility.

• Proposing a practical pipeline that facilitates high-fidelity
novel view synthesis of 360◦ panoramic images and reduces
the reliance on hyperparameters.

• Collecting a dataset of real and synthetic scenes with 360◦
image sequences covering a diverse set of indoor environ-
ments, which facilitate future research of scene-level neural
rendering. Relevant resources can be readily made available
to the public.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Neural Radiance Field and Important Variants
NeRF [Mildenhall et al. 2020] is a promising and powerful neural
scene representation for novel view synthesis. It uses the weight
of a multi-layer perceptron to model the density and color of the
scene as a function of continuous 5D coordinates and uses volume
rendering to synthesize new views with no limitation on sampling
rate. The input of NeRF is a combination of continuous coordi-
nates without the need to discretize the scene and therefore, it

supports rendering images of arbitrary resolution. The introduc-
tion of the positional encoding mechanism could preserve high-
frequency characteristics. Despite the outstanding visual perfor-
mance, canonical NeRF suffers from many open issues which re-
quire more research such as dynamic scenes [Pumarola et al. 2021],
varying lighting conditions [Martin-Brualla et al. 2021], fast training
and rendering[Hedman et al. 2021; Piala and Clark 2021], general
modeling[Wang et al. 2021] , few-shot learning [Yu et al. 2021b].
Until now, many researchers have proposed valuable variants to
address these issues and have significantly expanded the application
range and promoted robustness.

In our work, the most crucial issue is the efficiency of scene-level
rendering to achieve real-time and immersive roaming. NeRF casts
one camera ray per pixel and samples a set of points to query den-
sities and radiance colors at those sampled points. For the pure
implicit method, rendering the final color of each pixel requires
hundreds of network queries, making it hard to complete the com-
putation in a short time. Some methods[Lombardi et al. 2021; Xu
et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2021a] exploit the sparse features of other repre-
sentations such as mesh-based and primitive-based representations
to improve efficiency. Other methods try to reduce the querying
time and count. Neural Sparse Voxel Fields [Liu et al. 2020] speed
up the rendering process using empty space skipping and early ray
termination, which sample more points around entity surfaces and
reduce queries. AutoInt [Lindell et al. 2021] replaced the numer-
ical integration with a closed-form solution. DoNeRF [Neff et al.
2021] employs an extra network to predict sample locations di-
rectly and enforce those points closer to the intersection point of
the surface and the camera ray. The Nvidia research team [Müller
et al. 2022] reduced the training and rendering cost by embedding a
multi-resolution hash table of learnable feature vectors into a small
network which requires fewer floating-point operations. However,
these methods are constrained to object-centric or relatively small
scenes. In addition, KiloNeRF [Reiser et al. 2021] proves that using
thousands of tiny independent MLPs to represent entire radiance
fields can decrease the rendering time by three orders of magnitude.
Their divide-and-conquer strategies have an underlying assump-
tion that radiance fields are bounded by a box and its distribution
is balanced, so they decompose the radiance fields into multiple
volumes with same pre-defined resolution. However, different from
object-centric scenes, the structures of complex scenes are irregular
with the imbalanced spatial placement of objects. Balanced decom-
posing will waste a lot of neural perceptrons in an empty space.
Therefore, our method introduces an adaptive partition scheme to
make use of the perceptrons’ capacity. Another related concurrent
work, Block-NeRF [Tancik et al. 2022], also decomposes the whole
scene into several blocks and uses one individual NeRF to repre-
sent each block. The main difference is that their rendered image is
composited from rendering results of several block-NeRFs while we
assign each block with a tinier NeRF network before the rendering
process and synthesize the final image at once. Our method has less
memory consumption and higher rendering efficiency in principle.

Fig. 2. Overview of the 360Roam system. First, an omnidirectional neural radiance field (360NeRF) will be learned from a set of input 360◦ images. Then
we sample 360NeRF at different camera positions to progressively estimate the probabilistic geometry and fuse them into an occupancy map from which a
floorplan with objects is extracted. The 360NeRF will then be slimmed and adaptively divided into multiple geometry-aware sub-fields that improves both the
rendering quality and speed significantly.

2.2 Panorama Structure Estimation
The challenge of panorama view synthesis lies in the accurate esti-
mation of the 3D structures of the scene. The entangled contents
encoded in input images usually result in blurry artifacts on novel
panoramas. We could exploit structure information as a precursor to
regularize the model to output reasonable renderings. The depth and
the room layout are two of the most common and easily obtained
structure information. Methods for layout estimation are to either
directly output the layout [Yang et al. 2019] or predict probability
maps [Sun et al. 2019; Zou et al. 2018] to parse the scenes. Some
works [Jin et al. 2020; Zeng et al. 2020; Zioulis et al. 2019] jointly
learn the layout and panoramic depth and perform panoramic view
synthesis as a proxy task. Inspired by [Xu et al. 2021], which uses
room layout to guide the content generation process, we leverage
the layout to clip the depth map rendered from NeRF, which could
reduce the ambiguity and help render more photorealistic novel
panoramas. As far as we know, we are the first to extend NeRF to
panoramic view synthesis.

2.3 VR Photography
The omnidirectional image, which can cover 360◦ insight, is one
of the most typical types of VR photography and thus can provide
a more comprehensive view of the environment. It allows sparser
views to perform novel view synthesis on panoramas. Some works
have used RGBD panoramas [Serrano et al. 2019] including extra
depth information obtained from other types of sensors for novel
panorama synthesis. However, depth acquisition relies on expen-
sive and fragile sensors and depth estimation suffers from noises
and lighting conditions. We encourage synthesis methods that are
supervised by only visual images. [Huang et al. 2017; Serrano et al.
2019] developed VR applications which support flexible viewing
from 360◦ videos. Huang et al. [2017] utilized point clouds extracted
from a 360◦ video to enable real-time video playback. Serrano et
al. [2019] presented a layered representation for adding parallax

and real-time playback of 360◦ videos. Recently, inspired by the
MPI representation[Zhou et al. 2018], Lin et al. [2020] and Attal et
al. [2020] proposed multi-depth panorama (MDP) and multi-sphere
image (MSI) representation, respectively, to conduct rendering from
stereo 360◦ imagery. Previous works focused on processing existing
captured 360◦ videos which cost lots of additional time to capture or
post-process. Broxton et al. [2020] capture data using a customized
low-cost hemispherical array made from 46 synchronized action
sports cameras. The system can produce 6-DoF videos with a large
baseline, fine resolution, wild field of view and high frame rates. The
multi-sphere image (MSI) representation is used for light field video
synthesis, yielding accurate results but involves a memory-heavy
process. OmniPhotos [Bertel et al. 2020] reduced the capture time
by attaching a 360◦ camera to a rotating selfie stick. It enables quick
and casual capture of high-quality 360◦ panoramas with motion
parallax. The visual rendering quality is improved by automati-
cally and robustly reconstructing a scene-adaptive proxy geometry
that reduces vertical distortions during image-based view synthesis.
However, the user-centric VR methods often rely on dense capturing
requirements and do not scale for room- or scene-level roaming.

3 OMNIDIRECTIONAL NEURAL RENDERING
3.1 Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)
NeRF [Mildenhall et al. 2020] represents the scene as a function
of Cartesian coordinates, outputs densities and emitted radiance
colors at those querying locations. The function could be modeled by
simple MLP networks. Given a collection of 𝑀 images {I𝑚 }𝑀 with
corresponding camera poses {𝛀𝑚
4×4}𝑀 in a world frame, the goal is
to use the existing posed images to render new images from arbitrary
known but unseen perspectives 𝛀𝑘 ∉ {𝛀𝑚 }𝑀 . In order to get the
representation, for each pixel in the input images, a camera ray is
marched from its camera center through the scene within the near
and far sampling range [𝑡𝑛, 𝑡𝑓 ]. For any 3D point 𝒑 𝑗 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) in the

ray, a global MLP model is applied to transform the concatenation
of the point location (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) and viewing direction (represented by
a unit vector 𝒅) into a 1-dimension density (𝜎) and a 3-dimension
RGB color (𝑐). Since the density is only dependent to point position,
the model decomposes the mapping into predicting the density
using only the location as well as predicting the color using both
the location and viewing direction. Specifically, the mapping is
represented as a two-stage MLP. The first 8 fully-connected layers
of the network, denoted as 𝑀𝐿𝑃1:8, take as input the 3D position
𝒑 𝑗 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧), and output the density 𝜎 and a 256-dimension radiance
feature 𝑓𝑐 . The combination of the feature 𝑓𝑐 and viewing direction
𝒅 is processed by the final fully connected layer 𝑀𝐿𝑃9: and decoded
into the radiance 𝑐 (𝒑 𝑗 ) in terms of RGB value. The MLP model can
be represented as:

𝜎, 𝑓𝑐 = 𝑀𝐿𝑃1:8 (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧)
𝑐 (𝒑 𝑗 ) = 𝑀𝐿𝑃9: (𝑓𝑐, 𝒅) .

(1)

To improve rendering results, it utilizes positional encoding (which
is borrowed from the Transformer[Vaswani et al. 2017]) and maps
the input coordinates vectors into a high-dimension space. The
mapping is useful in modeling high-frequency functions. For each
coordinate component 𝑥𝑖 in both position and viewing direction,
the encoding is formulated as:

F (𝑥𝑖 ) = (sin 20𝜋𝑥𝑖, cos 20𝜋𝑥𝑖, ..., sin 2

𝐷−1𝜋𝑥𝑖, cos 2

𝐷−1𝜋𝑥𝑖 ) .

(2)
In addition, NeRF jointly optimizes two networks of same archi-
tecture as Eq. 1 with different parameters to increase rendering
efficiency and avoid over-sampling in free spaces. A coarse net-
work is evaluated on a set of 𝑁𝑐 locations using stratified sampling.
Based on the output densities of the coarse network, the coefficients
which could be represented as a function of density are normalized
as weights to form a piecewise-constant PDF (probability density
function). Additional 𝑁𝑓 points are sampled under this distribution.
All 𝑁𝑐 + 𝑁𝑓 points are used to query densities and colors through
the fine network and render the final color of the ray.

3.2 Omnidirectional Neural Radiance Field (360NeRF)
The involved coordinate systems used in NeRF are all Cartesian
while a panorama uses the panoramic pixel grid coordinate system,
in which each pixel (𝑢, 𝑣) in the panoramic image corresponds to a
point (𝜙, 𝜃 ) in a sphere surface represented by the spherical polar
coordinate system. The transformation between the two coordinate
systems is described by:

𝑢 = 𝜙 ∗ 𝑊 /(2𝜋) + 𝑊 /2
𝑣 = −𝜃 ∗ 𝐻 /𝜋 + 𝐻 /2 ,

(3)

where 𝑢, 𝑣 denote column and row of the panorama, 𝜙, 𝜃 denote
longitude and latitude of the spherical surface, and 𝐻,𝑊 denote the
height and width of the panorama respectively. Additionally, the
relation between spherical and 3D Cartesian coordinate systems is:

𝑥 = cos 𝜃 sin 𝜙
𝑦 = − sin 𝜃
𝑧 = cos 𝜃 cos 𝜙 .

(4)

ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2022.

The camera ray cast from a panoramic pixel can be formulated as
𝒓 = 𝒐 + 𝑟 𝒅 (𝜙/𝑓 , 𝜃 /𝑓 , 1), where 𝒐 is the camera center, 𝑓 is the focal
length, 𝒅 is the ray direction and 𝑟 is the radial distance of a point
in the ray. However, instead of transforming the coordinate to a
3D Cartesian coordinate, we use an alternative parameterization to
model the omnidirectional neural radiance field, referred as 360NeRF.
360NeRF conducts sampling in the spherical coordinate system and
represents the points in inverse distance behavior, 𝒑 𝑗 (𝜙, 𝜃, 1/𝑟 ). And
then 360NeRF queries a MLP for corresponding color and density.
Therefore, combining the initial MLP model (Eq. 1) and positional
encoding (Eq. 2), our model could be rewritten as:

𝜎, 𝑓𝑐 = 𝑀𝐿𝑃1:8 (F (𝒑 𝑗 ))
𝑐 (𝒑 𝑗 ) = 𝑀𝐿𝑃9: (𝑓𝑐, F (𝒅)) ,
where the positional embedding function F is applied individually
on each component of a vector.

(5)

Finally, we accumulate the densities and radiance of 𝑁 samplings
along the ray R𝑖 to get the final color ^𝐶 (R𝑖 ) and depth ^𝐷 (R𝑖 ) es-
timation of the pixel, similar to the volume rendering formulated
in NeRF. Supposing the sampling position along the ray is 𝑡𝑖 , the
corresponding color and depth can be calculated by :

4 GEOMETRY-AWARE 360NERFS
In structured scenes, there are a lot of open spaces and the distri-
butions of objects are spatially sparse. It means that the density
of radiance fields is highly imbalanced. The perspectives from the
camera are always surrounded by the fields. If we uniformly sample
along the rays, it is highly inefficient and easy to get trapped in the
local minimum. Conversely, by skipping empty spaces and upsam-
pling, occupied volumes are able to accelerate volume rendering
and effectively improve the rendering quality. In our systems, we
introduce a probabilistic progressive layout estimation method to
recover geometric information from 360NeRF. Furthermore, based
on the density of radiance fields, 360NeRF will be adaptively slimmed
and further fine-tuned to become multiple tiny geometry-aware
radiance fields.

4.1 Progressive Probabilistic Geometry Estimation
4.1.1 Occupancy Map. To extract geometric information from NeRF,
the existing approach relying on global density sampling has two
limitations. First, it assumes the radiance field is covered by a cuboid
and based on the known boundary to estimate the geometry which
is generally not practical especially for outward-facing scenes. Al-
though we can utilize a structure-from-motion algorithm to roughly
estimate a bounding box of radiance field, global density sampling
is sensitive to outliers and difficult to handle polyhedral scenes due
to overfitting, as shown in Fig.3a. It will lead to a waste of neural

perceptrons since we rely on recovered geometry to decompose radi-
ance fields and assign networks as elaborated in the Section 4.2. The
other limitation is being highly reliant on the prior information of
density value. It is vulnerable in terms of dealings with transparent
objects and mirror refection.

To bridge this gap, we formulated occupancy recovery as a pro-
gressive probability estimation problem. Intuitively, the present
state of each voxel depends on the current measurement and the
previous estimation. The probabilistic model [Yguel et al. 2008]
could be formulated in logit notation:

𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑝 |𝑧1:𝑡 ) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑝 |𝑧1:𝑡 −1) + 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑝 |𝑧𝑡 ) ,

(7)

where 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑝) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑝
1−𝑝 and 𝑝 is the probability of occupancy; 𝑧1:𝑡
represents the accumulated observation from the start to time 𝑡 and
𝑧𝑡 is the current observations at time 𝑡; With the incoming observa-
tions, it can progressively update the occupied probability of each
voxel. The range of 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑝) is from -2 and 3.5 which indicates the
occupied probability of 0.12 and 0.97. When the probability is larger
than the threshold, the voxel will be considered occupied. To facili-
tate these processes, we adapt a typical reconstruction framework
Octomap [Hornung et al. 2013] which utilizes an octree to store and
maintain the occupied probability of voxel. Based on predefined
measurement uncertainty, Octomap only takes depth maps as in-
put to generate occupancy voxel. However, we can take advantage
of 360NeRF to obtain a panorama distance map at each sampling
location as well as the uncertainty estimation by normalizing the
weight of Eq. 6. Therefore, we shall make use of the information to
enhance occupancy map reconstruction. The measurement proba-
bility will be changed according to the current 360NeRF estimation.
To reduce the use of hyperparameters, the resolution of occupancy

voxel depends on the ray sample rate of 360NeRF. In addition, the
sampling locations can base on the pose of the training images or
we can densely sample more points around these prior locations to
further increase the accuracy. In our system, it simply goes through
locations in the training set which is generally sufficient to recon-
struct an appropriate occupancy map of the scene. This process is
depicted in the first part of Algorithm 1. As Fig. 3 shows, this pro-
gressive probabilistic geometry estimation method is more effective
compared to the global density sampling.

Floorplan. The estimated occupancy map provides useful
4.1.2
geometric information to refine the radiance fields and we further
exploit it to estimate the floorplan of the scene. The floorplan can be
used to guide ray sampling and restrict the walking path at inference
time. The floorplan we are estimating here is essentially the inner
surface of the wall and any objects in the scene that obstruct the
navigation path. To better filter out noisy voxels from the occupancy
map, we project a range of occupied voxels in the upper slicing
regions (60% to 65% of the height to avoid head jamb for multi-room
contours) to a floor-parallel plane to form an initial layout (Fig.4a).
By using some simple morphological operations we segment out
the inner boundary as show in Fig.4b. The most important part
here is to determine the slicing direction which should be floor-
parallel. Namely, we need to estimate the direction of the gravity
of the reconstructed scene. Benefit from 360◦ images, we can get
the gravity direction of the structured scene via calculating three

vanishing points [Sun et al. 2021]. After aligning the 360◦ images
with gravity, we are able to estimate the height and extract the
floor-parallel plane. Finally, to complete the floorplan with interior
items such as chairs, tables, etc. which obstruct the indoor roaming
path, we project occupied voxels in the lower slicing region (20%
to 30% of the height that covers most of the obstructing objects) to
the floor-parallel plane (Fig.4a) and intersect the projected voxels
with the inner boundary (Fig.4c). In 360Roam, the intersected clean
floorplan can enhance the user experience with visualized scene
boundary and item obstacles.

4.2 Adaptive Radiance Fields Slimming and Fine-tuning
Rendering an image from the NeRF model for one pixel costs hun-
dreds of network queries. In order to accelerate inference speed
and meet the need for real-time rendering, we can divide and de-
couple the entire neural radiance field and parallel processing for
each bundle of rays. However, in a large-scale scene, the distribu-
tion of objects and their corresponding radiance fields are highly
imbalanced. As the empty space does not contribute to volume ren-
dering, we should avoid sampling and wasting the capacity of neural
perceptron in empty spaces. Therefore, in contrary to the uniform
divide-and-conquer strategy used in KiloNeRF [Reiser et al. 2021],
we no longer decompose the radiance field simply based on identi-
cal volume. Instead, our decomposition strategy is geometry-aware
and takes scene geometry information into account. Specifically,
based on the extracted occupancy map, we can obtain the density
distribution of the radiance fields which can be represented by the
number of the occupied voxels. We then decompose the field into
𝑛 sub-fields with a similar amount of occupied voxels as described
in the second stage of Algorithm 1 . Since the occupied voxels in
360NeRF are spatially imbalanced, each sub-field has a distinct vol-
ume. This step only requires one hyperparameter 𝑛, the number
of tiny MLPs, which can be adjusted according to computational
resources and demand in terms of rendering performance. After
this, each of the 𝑛 tiny MLPs is used to cover each sub-field which is
illustrated in the Fig.5. Eventually, our system can make use of the

NeRF, but their renderings quality are smiliar. (c) By contrast, we use the
occupancy map to adaptively decompose the 360NeRF into 𝑛 sub-fields and
assign the tiny MLP with the same network structure to handle different
regions. Each sub-field has similar amount of occupied voxels. The actual
number depends on the scene geometry in practice. For illustration pur-

geometry-aware 360NeRFs allow effective empty space skipping and dense
sampling in occupied voxels to improve rendering quality.

capability of neural networks and reduce the usage of MLPs while
maintaining high-fidelity rendering.

To decouple each sub-field while persisting global consistency, a
fine-tuning process is conducted. The initial weights of tiny MLPs
are distilled from the 360NeRF to increase the fine-tuning speed.
Similar to distillation procedures [Reiser et al. 2021], each MLP M𝑘
will sample 𝐼 corresponding points in the 360NeRF to obtain the
global domain radiance values 𝒄𝑖 and densities 𝜎𝑖 . M𝑘 ’s parameters
are optimized via minimizing the mean squared errors between
global and local values (𝒄𝑘

𝑖 ), which is formulated as:

After initialization, the parameters of all tiny neural networks will
be fine-tuned by using the original training images. During the fine-
tuning phase, it will densely sample the occupied voxels instead of
uniform sampling along the rays. As radiance fields are slimmed and
a vast amount of empty sampling is being avoided, the fine-tuning
process can be converged quickly.

To achieve real-time rendering performance for immersive 360◦
roaming, we have taken advantage of ray casting techniques to
quickly localize occupied voxels. After partitioning the radiance

field as described in Section 4.2, each occupied voxel in the occu-
pancy map has been labeled to the corresponding tiny MLP M𝑘 ’s.
In addition, we converted the occupancy map into a voxel hashing
data structure and stored it in a GPU such that each ray can be
concurrently processed. Due to the support of data structure, effi-
cient empty space skipping, and parallel MLPs queries, our proposed
system can run at real-time speed on a GPU GTX1080.

5 EXPERIMENT
In this section, we detail how to collect 360◦ panoramic data and per-
form the novel view synthesis from scratch. We describe the applied
network architectures and important hyper-parameters. Moreover,
we conducted thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluations to
show our results outperform previous baseline methods and achieve
SOTA performance. Finally, the ablation studies prove the validity
of our proposed method.

5.1 Dataset
To evaluate our proposed methods, we employed both synthetic
and real-world data which are a collection of 360◦ image sequences
captured at various indoor scenes as Fig.6 shows.

In terms of real-world data, we used an ‘Insta360 ONE X2’ 360◦
camera to capture real-world panoramas. We carefully selected
10 scenes named Bar, Base, Cafe, Canteen, Center, Corridor,
Innovation, Lab, Library and Office respectively and picked 140
panoramas on average for each scene. They cover diverse indoor
environments which have different styles, furniture arrangements,
and layouts with multiple relevant separated spaces. To facilitate
data collection, we fixed the camera rig on a tracked mobile robot
with a height of 1m and controlled the robot remotely. In addition,
we used HDR capture model to preserve image quality. The res-
olution of the image is 6080 × 3040. Finally, we used a 360 SFM
pipeline [Huang and Yeung 2022] to process 360◦ images, while we
only reserved keyframes extracted by SFM pipeline. In addition, we

separated the keyframes into two sets, one set serves as training
data and another serves as testing data with ratio 4:1.

The synthetic data is better for quantitative comparison since we
can get error-free testing ground-truth data. Therefore, we applied
the off-the-shelf Replica [Straub et al. 2019] dataset to render im-
ages from reconstructed 3D models of indoor spaces. The related
SDK provides a user interface to generate perspective images. We
rendered a cube map containing 6 perspective images at each cap-
turing location and transformed the cube maps into equirectangular
images with the resolution of 3840 × 1920. We have collected 5
sets of synthetic data, named as Replica_1, Replica_2, Replica_3,
Replica_4, Replica_5. We collected around 80 panoramas per scene
with on average 66 for training and 16 for testing.

Implementations

5.2
5.2.1 Baselines. To evaluate our model, we compared it to the
canonical NeRF [Mildenhall et al. 2020], Mip-NeRF [Barron et al.
2021], KiloNeRF [Reiser et al. 2021] and NSVF [Liu et al. 2020].
NSVF aforehand defines a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields or-
ganized in a voxel octree to model local properties in each cell and
progressively learn the underlying voxel structures during train-
ing which achieves good performance in object-centric scenarios.
KiloNeRF dramatically improves inference speed by introducing
uniform divide-and-conquer strategy while maintaining similar ren-
dering quality to vanilla NeRF. Mip-NeRF found that the uneven
placement of objects results in blurred renderings of NeRF in near
views and aliasing artifacts in far views. Mip-NeRF resolved this
problem by casting a cone for each pixel as well as decomposing the
cone into several conical frustums. Instead of applying positional
encoding features on those frustums, Mip-NeRF proposed an inte-
grated positional encoding feature based on a multivariate Gaussian.
These strategies already take scale into consideration and thereby a
unified MLP network is able to represent the scene. The hierarchical

sampling strategy is reserved while the query of coarse points and
fine points is performed through the same network.

5.2.2 Network Architectures Used in Our Pipeline. For 360NeRF, we
applied a single normal MLP network detailed in Table 1 to model
the scene. All layers are fully-connected layers with ReLU activation
unless specified otherwise. The input position vector is transformed
into positional encoding vector and then passed through 8 layers. A
skip connection is used in the fifth layer to preserve information
from former layers by concatenating the positional encoding and
the output of the fourth layer. The ninth layer outputs a density
rectified by a ReLU to guarantee non-negativity and a feature vector.
Viewing direction with positional encoding is concatenated with
the feature vector to contribute to producing radiance. The final
layer is activated by sigmoid to restrict the values within range
[0, 1]. The count of network parameters is about 0.596M. We do not
use hierarchical sampling strategy, two-pass MLP query, in order to
reduce training and inference time.

In terms of tiny MLP networks in the final system, the network
architecture is detailed in Table 2. The skip connection is excluded
from the network. Compared to the normal MLP, the width and the
depth of the tiny network are significantly compressed while the
amount of network parameters is 6212.

5.2.3 Training Details and Parameters. As the training of NeRF or
other NeRF-based methods is commonly time-comsuming, we re-
sized real-scene images into 1520 × 760 and synthetic images into

ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2022.

1920 × 960 for training and evaluation. For NeRF, it sampled 64
points per ray for the coarse query. And then it sampled another
128 points and used all 192 points for the fine query. Therefore, it
took 254 network queries in total to render a pixel. To ensure a fair
comparison, we kept the number of queries and training epochs of
all approaches the same. However, NSVF is extremely GPU-memory
hungry, and the demand on memory would continuously increase
as it iteratively subdivides and optimizes voxel during training. Fol-
lowing the default parameters configuration, all the models of NSVF
were trained in a multi-process distributed manner using 4 NVIDIA
RTX 3090 GPUs with 24 GB memory. NSVF would stop training
once out of memory error occurs. Moreover, both NSVF and KiloN-
eRF requires bounding boxes of scenes and fixed voxel resolutions
for training. These prerequisite parameters were estimated from the
occupancy maps reconstructed by our methods.

Our proposed method is implemented in Pytorch and CUDA.
We applied the Adam optimizer with a learning rate that begins
at 1e-3 and decays exponentially to 5e-5 during optimization. The
hyperparameters of the optimizer are set to the default values with
𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.99. For every backward stage, we used a batch of
4096 rays per process. The coarse training of a 360NeRF takes about
15 hours on 4 RTX 2080 Ti GPUs while the fine-tuning of thousands
of tiny networks generally takes 4 hours after slimming.

5.3 Floorplans
From the geometric estimation (Sec. 4.1), we estimated the floorplans
for all real and synthetic scenes, parts of the results are illustrated in
Fig. 9 and 10. Our system can support diverse shapes of indoor scenes
which are not only limited to single room or cuboid combinations.
The estimated floorplan with objects can be used to provide users
with a visual guidance for indoor roaming and avoiding occlusions.
Please refer to supplementary for more visual floorplan samples.

5.4 Novel View Synthesis
We evaluated the novel view synthesis performance for both real and
synthetic scenes quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative mea-
surements in terms of appearance similarity including Peak Signal-
to-noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)
and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) [Zhang et al.
2018] are adopted to analyze performance. We compared perfor-
mance between baselines and our methods, and conducted ablation
study to analyze the influence of the number of tiny networks used to
conquer the radiance fields and validate the effectiveness of making
use of probabilistic geometry for fine-tuning and adaptive slimming.

Influence of number of tiny networks. 360Roam relies on

geometry-aware 360◦ radiance fields which are essentially gen-
erated via slimming and decomposing the initial 360NeRF into 𝑛
slimming fields. To analyze the effect and identify the necessary
amount to achieve a balance between the rendering quality and
computational cost, we measured the rendering quality of 5 syn-
thetic scenes using different 𝑛, including 100, 200, 300, 400, 512, 1024,
2048, 3072 and 4096. The evaluated results are illustrated as charts
in Fig. 7. By thousands of tiny networks, the more networks used,
the better performance is. When amount exceeds a thousand, there
is no obvious improvement and may even cause degradation in the

uniformly dividing the radiance field without consideration of density distribution. 360Roam-# denotes the system is composed of # MLPs. The counts of
network parameters of 360Roam-200 and NeRF are similar, while storage memory of 360Roam-100 and NeRF is similar. 360NeRF is the initial model which is

final rendering quality. In general, a larger amount of networks
can have a faster rendering speed until reaching GPU capability of
parallel computing. The memory and the number of tiny networks
are linearly dependent, while 100 and 4096 tiny network models
requires 7.13𝑀𝐵 and 291.21𝑀𝐵 memory space respectively. It is
worth noting that the memory cost of 360Roam-100 using 100 tiny
networks is similar to NeRF while the capacities of neural percep-
tron are comparable in 360Roam-200 and NeRF, having about 1.2M
parameters. Overall, we used 2048 as a typical parameter to conduct
the below evaluation.

5.4.2 Quantitative Evaluation. The average metrics on real and
synthetic sets are reported in Table. 3 and you could refer to the
supplementary for the detailed results of individual scenes. From
the results reported in Table. 3, our complete system, 360Roam,
achieves the best quality on real and synthetic data while the render
speed is two thousands times faster than NeRF [Mildenhall et al.
2020] and Mip-NeRF [Barron et al. 2021]. If we decompose the
global radiance field into uniform voxel and use similar amount
of networks, 360Roam-u can achieve comparable performance on
synthetic scenes. But the performance of uniform decomposition
is significantly degraded on real scenes. Another method relying
on uniform decomposition, KiloNeRF [Reiser et al. 2021], has the
same phenomenon. This is because the layout of real scenes are
more complicated and the density distribution of the radiance field
is highly imbalanced. Uniform decomposition leads to capacity of
neural perceptrons wasted in insignificant regions. Obviously, the

proposed adaptive slimming method made the model more stable.
When there is no exploit of geometry to fine-tune the radiance
filed, 360NeRF sightly suppresses the original NeRF and Mip-NeRF.
Furthermore, with the increasing use of tiny MLP, the rendering
quality of the system is enhanced. In generally, it requires more
tiny MLPs and memory to reach similar capacity of a deep MLP.
Although 360Roam-200 achieves competitive results against NeRF,
its performance still degrades compared to 360NeRF. As a method
focusing on object-centric or small-scale scenes, NSVF [Liu et al.
2020] cannot converge on these dataset. But we would like to note
that results of NSVF could possibly be improved by providing the
depth to explicitly shape the neural voxels or using more powerful
GPU during training.

It is noticeable that results of real scenes generally have a worse
performance compared to synthetic scenes. Since real scenes suffer
from nonuniform lighting exposure cross views and camera pose
approximation, while synthetic scenes provide ground-truth camera
parameters and are rendered under the same illumination settings.

5.4.3 Qualitative Evaluation. Visual comparisons between base-
lines and our method are displayed in Fig. 8. Our novel view images
for either the real scene (top scene) or the synthetic scene (bottom
scene) always have higher fidelity of the texture at any distance.
For example, the complex wall texture in the red bounded area in
the real scene (first row), and the paintings with textual elements
in the blue bounded area in the synthetic scene (fourth row) are
generated with clear and recognizable details by our approach. The

baselines can only synthesize blurry and non-photorealistic texture.
In addition, ours supports rendering fine details at near and far
distances, while the baselines produce blurry objects in the near
area and a hazy effect for distant area. In the far blue bounded area
of the real scene (second row), our images contain subtle details
for the ceiling lamp and tableware at a closer distance, and clear

parasols and buildings at a farther distance. At such ranges, the
baselines fail to synthesize any clear objects. At closer ranges in the
red bounded area of the synthetic scene (third row), our approach
produces delicate textures from the near bedside to pillows while
baselines only render indistinct texture.

6 DISCUSSION, LIMITATION, AND FUTURE WORK
We demonstrated how 360Roam effectively extends the conven-
tional NeRF into the geometry-aware 360NeRFs to generate high
quality 360◦ images for real-time indoor roaming. We also conduct
an additional comparison with a typical way which uses 3D recon-
struction [Schönberger and Frahm 2016; Schönberger et al. 2016]

meshes for real scene roaming. As the COLMAP does not support
360◦ images, we crop the training panoramas into cube maps and
then use the same camera poses to run the COLMAP. An illustrative
example is shown in Fig.11. Our approach produces real-time photo-
realisitc renderings and has a dramatic advantage over conventional
3D reconstruction which shows obvious geometry and texture arti-
facts. 360Roam has large potential for VR roaming for large-scale
indoor real scenes with less resource requirements and manpower.
However, by doing so we also inherit the limitations of NeRF and
panorama scene understanding. We list the most important issues
and potential directions to further improve the system.
Camera model. We use an ideal spherical camera model to de-
scribe the projection of 360◦ camera. However, a consumer-grade
360◦ camera outputs 360◦ images by optimizing the stitching of
two fish-eye images. Due to manufacturing deficiency and the im-
perfection of factory camera calibration, original images sometimes
have obvious stitching artifacts which will affect the rendering qual-
ity, as Fig. 12 shows. This is one key reason why the performance
on real scenes are noticeably worse than that of synthetic scenes.
Although we can exploit a professional 360◦ camera for capturing,
it is necessary to take distortion into account and optimize camera
intrinsic parameters during training.
Influence of the estimated geometry. Different from vanilla
NeRF or 360NeRF which models geometry implicitly, the complete
360Roam is a hybrid system where the ray sampling is based on
explicit geometry for increasing synthetic quality and speed. Our
progressive probabilistic geometry estimation method allows us to
obtain a proper occupancy map fitting the scene rather than to get
an exquisite 3D reconstruction. It is capable of modeling transpar-
ent objects, as shown in the first row of Fig. 13. However, once the
recovered geometry is deficient, the quality of the synthetic image
would suffer. The bottom row of Fig. 13 provides an example.
Training time and generalization. NeRF-based methods require
a long training time to train MLP networks overfitting the scene.
Consequently, it cannot generalize to predict novel images of ar-
bitrary scenes. Each time the data of a new scene is collected, it
usually takes tens of hours to converge which brings inconvenience.
If we want to use different training resolutions, add newly captured
images or fix flaws in a few panoramas, it requires the parameters
of the model to be retrained from scratch. It is important to either
reduce the training time or expand the model application range.

Dynamic and deformable objects. Currently, our method as-
sumes the scene is static and no motion blur will occur in the images.
When we collected real-world scenes, we avoided human interrup-
tion or furniture arrangement changed. It will be useful if we can
detect moving and non-rigid regions from the captured panora-
mas and apply additional models [Li et al. 2021] or interpolation
methods [Jiang et al. 2018] to deal with those areas.
Few-shot sampling. Most NeRF-based methods require dense scene
sampling to collect as much environmental information as possible.
And most existing datasets for novel view synthesis task usually
contains tens of or even hundreds of images representing an object
or small scenes. However, our dataset only uses about hundreds
of images to represent a large-scale scenes. The distributions of
training panoramas of all scenes are displayed in the supplementary.
Although panoramas having a wider field of view are beneficial
for representing large scenes, the rendering quality can still be
poor in under-sampled areas. How to provide a more realistic view-
dependent effect with few-shot training will be an interesting future
direction.

7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we seek to extend neural radiance fields to handle
large indoor scenes while having real-time performances for novel
view synthesis. Therefore, we propose 360Roam which is a novel
neural rendering pipeline taking 360◦ images as input to learn om-
nidirectional radiance fields 360NeRF first. The 360NeRF is further
slimmed and fine-tuned according to the estimated probabilistic
geometry. The geometry-aware 360◦ radiance fields not only accel-
erate the rendering speed but also improve the rendering quality. It
can maintain fidelity even if the perspective of view undergoes a
large translational motion. With the floorplan guidance, our system

is capable of providing an appealing and immersive indoor roaming
experience which is promising for various VR applications.
