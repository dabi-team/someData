Abstract 

Firms  with  different  ownership  structures  could  be  argued  to  have  different  levels  of  efficiency.  Highly 
concentrated firms are expected to be more efficient as this type of ownership structure may alleviate the conflict 
of interest between managers and shareholders. In Malaysia, public-listed firms have been found to have highly 
concentrated  ownership  structure.  However,  whether  this  evidence  holds  for  every  industry  has  not  been 
established.  Hence,  the  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  investigate  whether  there  are  variations  in  ownership 
structure and firm’s efficiency across sectors. To achieve this objective, the frequency distributions of ownership 
structure  were  calculated  and  firms’  efficiency  scores  for  consumer  products,  industrial  products,  construction 
and  trading/services  sectors  were  measured.  Data  Envelopment  Analysis  (DEA)  under  the  assumptions  of 
constant returns to scale (CRS) and variable returns to scale (VRS) was employed to estimate firms’ efficiency 
scores.  A  sample  of  156  firms  listed  on  the  Kuala  Lumpur  Stock  Exchange  (KLSE)  was  selected  using  the 
stratified  random  sampling  method.  The  findings  have  shown  that  there  are  variations  in  firm  ownership 
structure and efficiency across sectors. 

Keywords: ownership structure, firm efficiency, DEA 

1. Introduction 

Firm ownership structure in Malaysia has changed as business organizations flourish and the national economy 
grows.  In  addition,  it  has  also  changed  due  to  economic  transition,  industrialization  and  privatization  policies 
implemented by the government over the past four decades. As a result, size of firms have expanded and caused 
susbstantial changes in the dispersion, redistribution and concentration of ownership structure. Ramli (2010), for 
instance, has found that ownership structure in Malaysia is concentrated and large shareholders are in control. He 
found that the largest shareholders or a shareholder group owns around 40% of companies’ paid-up capital. In 
addition, according to the study by Claessens, Djankov, Fan and Lang (2000) on corporations in nine East Asian 
countries, Malaysia has the third highest concentration of control after Thailand and Indonesia. 

In  general,  firms  with  different  ownership  structure  are  argued  to  have  different  levels  of  efficiency.  Highly 
concentrated firms will be more efficient because this type of ownership structure may alleviate the conflict of 
interests  between  managers  and  shareholders.  This  statement  is  mainly  grounded  in  the  very  well-known 
principal-agency  problem  model  by  Jensen  and  Meckling  (1976).  The  principal-agency  problem  argues  that 
managerial share-ownership may reduce managerial incentives for privileges, expropriating shareholders’ wealth 
or  engaging  in  other  sub-optimal  activities.  This  subsequently  helps  in  aligning  the  interest  of  managers  and 
shareholders and consequently lowers agency costs and increases firm value. Regarding diffused shareholding, 
this kind of ownership structure does not provide adequate control to the shareholders due to the lack of capacity 
and motivation to monitor management decisions. Hence, the model predicts that larger managerial ownership 
stakes should lead to better firm performance.   

The study by Abdul Samad (2002) reveals the existence of a high concentration of ownership in Malaysia. His 
study  on  the  public-listed  companies  in  Malaysia  found  that  the  means  of  shareholdings  of  the  largest 
shareholders and the five largest shareholders to be about 30% and 60%, respectively. This finding indicates that 
companies on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) are less diffused but are dominated by companies with 
concentrated shareholders, typically families or government-owned or promoted institutions.   

Therefore,  in  view  of  the  previous  evidence  of  high  ownership  concentration  of  firms  in  Malaysia,  this  study 
attempts  to  investigate  the  variation  in  ownership  structure  and  the  variation  in  efficiency  of  the  public-listed

firms in Malaysia. By focusing our investigation on the variations in ownership structure and efficiency across 
sectors,  we  expect  to  gain  a  greater  understanding  of  the  actual  scenario  of  firms’  ownership  structure  and 
efficiency  in Malaysia  and  to  ascertain whether  the  efficiency of public  listed firms  in  Malaysia  differs  across 
sectors. By conducting our analysis across sectors, this study hopes to add new and meaningful contributions to 
the previous literature on firms’ efficiency and ownership structure.   

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the next section provides a brief literature review, followed by the 
methodology, discussion of results, policy implications and conclusion. 

2. Literature Review 

This  review  provides  a  brief  discussion  of  the  literature  on  ownership  structure  and  firm  efficiency  and  firm 
performance.  A  firm’s  ownership  structure  is  an  important  driver  of  its  efficiency  and  profitability  (Church  & 
Ware,  2000).  A  firm  which  operates  at  a  high  efficiency  level  can  normally  be  associated  with  higher 
performance or profitability. Morck, Schleifer and Vishny (1988) have suggested that firm performance is likely 
to vary across industries.   

In  general,  a  firm’s  ownership  structure  can  differ  along  two  main  dimensions.  First,  the  degree  of  ownership 
concentration, which refers to whether ownership of a firm is more or less-dispersed. Second, the nature of the 
owners,  which  refers  to who  owns  the  majority  stake  in  the firm.  Firms’ ownership  structure  can  significantly 
influence firms’ efficiency, such as through its influence on the decision making process. Specifically, a firm’s 
ownership  structure  determines  its  capital  structure.  Furthermore,  a  firm’s  capital  structure  influences  its 
investment and growth behavior. Both factors then become the major driving force of future returns to a firm and 
eventually affect firm efficiency.   

important 

implications  for  firm  efficiency  and  strategic  development.  Based  on 

Furthermore,  various  researchers  such  as  Williamson  (1964),  Marris  (1964),  Galbraith  (1967),  Pfeffer  and 
Salancik  (1978),  Salami  (2011),  Su  and  He  (2012),  Bejan  and  Bidian  (2012)  have  argued  that  ownership 
structure  has 
the 
principal-agency  problem  model,  Jensen  and  Meckling  (1976)  have  argued  that  a  firm’s  performance  will  be 
negatively related to low ownership concentration and positively related to high ownership concentration. This 
can be explained by the concept of diffused shareholding. Salami (2011) has discovered two important findings. 
First,  most  of  the  listed  companies  have  high  ownership  concentration  in  structure;  and  second,  corporate 
governance structure is an important element in the investment strategies of these companies. These two findings 
appear to show some positive relationship with corporate investment efficiency. Thus, the study shows that there 
exists  a  positive  relationship  amongst  the  share-ownership  structure,  corporate  governance  structure,  and 
corporate profitability.   

In  contrast,  Morck  et  al.  (1988)  believed  that  concentrated  ownership  may  be  associated  negatively  with  firm 
performance  where  the  overall  effect  on  firm  value  may  be  positive  at  low  concentration  but  negative  at  high 
concentration  levels.  Similarly,  Su  and  He  (2012)  found  similar  results.  Their  study  of  744  public-listed 
manufacturing firms in China for the period 1999 to 2006 found that firm efficiency, estimated using stochastic 
frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis, is negatively related to state ownership but positively related to 
public  and  employee  share-ownership.  They  also  found  that  the  relationship  between  ownership  concentration 
and firm efficiency is U-shaped, illustrating that the largest shareholder may engage in tunneling activities. As 
the identity of the largest shareholder changes from government or government-controlled legal entity to other 
types  of  legal  entity,  firm  efficiency  significantly  improves.  This  indicates  that  firms  with  more  independent 
board  are  more  efficient.  This  evidence  supports  the  idea  that  board  of  directors  can  be  an  effective  internal 
governance mechanism.   

In  addition,  the  study  by  Iannotta,  Nocera  and  Sironi  (2006)  have  divided  the  European  banking  industry 
ownership  classification  into  privately-owned  banks  (POBs),  mutual  banks  (MBs),  and  government-owned 
banks (GOBs). Their findings have shown that ownership concentration does not significantly affect profitability. 
The  study  by  Altanbas,  Evans  and  Molyneux  (2001)  uses  a  variety  of  approaches  to  model  cost  and  profit 
efficiencies for different ownership types in the German Banking market did not find strong evidence in support 
of  the  proposition  that  private  ownership  is  associated  with  better  firm  performance  and  enterprise  efficiency 
than  state  ownership.  They  found  that  privately-owned  banks  are  less  efficient  than  their  mutual  and  public 
sector  counterparts.  Their  inefficiency  measures  indicate  that  private  banks  have  slight  cost  and  profit 
disadvantages over their mutual and public sector competitors.   

Meanwhile,  another  group  of  researchers  such  as  Jensen  and  Meckling  (1976),  Demsetz  (1983),  Fama  and 
Jensen (1983), and Demsetz and Lehn (1985) have claimed the irrelevancy of ownership structure. For instance, 
Demsetz (1983) argued that there should be no systematic relationship between variations in ownership structure

and variations in firm performance. Thomsen and Pedersen (2000) have argued that the effect of concentrated or 
dispersed  ownership  on  firm  performance  will  be  difficult  to  predict  unless  one  controls  for  the  firm’s  capital 
structure  choice.  In  other  words,  the  relationship  between  ownership  concentration  and  firm  performance  also 
depends  on  the  identity  of  the  major  shareholders.  Different  types  of  shareholders  have  different  investment 
priorities and preferences for how to deal with principal-agency problem. Even though these differences can be 
solved in board meetings when consensuses are achieved, the implementation will be executed by the managers 
who might have different objectives from the shareholders. While shareholders’ objective is to get high profit, 
managers’ objectives may be getting high profit, good working environment, good salary, and improvement of 
workers’ welfare.   

Furthermore, other studies such as Ang, Hauser and Lauterbach (1997) and Lauterbach and Vaninsky (1999) for 
instance, have used the second criterion in classifying ownership structure. They distinguished between non-owner 
managed firms, firms controlled by concerns, firms controlled by a family, and firms controlled by a group of 
individuals  (partners).  The  latter  found  that  dispersed  ownership  and  non-owner  manager  promotes  firm 
performance, estimated as the actual net income of the firm divided by the optimal net income given by the firm’s 
inputs. These findings can be supported by the studies of Morck et al. (1988) and McConnell and Servaes (1990), 
which have demonstrated that percentage ownership appears insufficient for describing the control structure. For 
instance, two firms with identical overall percentage ownership by large blockholders are likely to have different 
control  organizations,  depending  on  the  identity  of  the  large  blockholders.  They  also  argued  that  the  relation 
between percentage ownership and firm performance is non-linear. Therefore, as stressed by Shleifer and Vishny 
(1997), the implication is that, it is important, not only how much equity a shareholder owns, but also who this 
shareholder is, that is, a private person, financial institution, non-financial institution enterprise, multi-national 
corporation or government. 

In  Malaysia,  according  to  Thillainathan  (1999),  the  controlling  shareholder  (i.e.  those  holding  more  than  50% 
ownership) through the pyramid structure is common. The controlling shareholders, either individuals/families 
or firms, are in the position to expropriate minority interests using their dominant voting right. Thillainathan’s 
findings  proved  that  large  ownership  or  ownership  concentration  may  contribute  to  deficiencies  in  corporate 
governance. Furthermore, the study by Gedajlovic and Shapiro (2002) on Japanese firms used both measures of 
ownership  structure. Their  first  measure  is ownership by  five  largest blockholders, which does not distinguish 
shareholders’ identities. The second and third measures are ownership by financial institutions and ownership by 
non-financial institutions, where each measure is equal to the percentage of a company’s outstanding shares held 
by Japanese financial and non-financial companies. Their results show a positive relationship between ownership 
concentration  and  financial  performance,  which  is  consistent  with  agency  theory  prediction.  This  finding 
suggests  that  large  Japanese  investors  can  operate  as  effective  monitors  of  top  executives  in  other  firms.  In 
addition, their results also indicate that shareholders identity matters. Their conclusion is based on the fact that 
redistribution effects (transfer of profits from profitable firm to less profitable firm) was found only when they 
examined  the  ownership  of  financial  and  non-financial  firms.  Such  a  result  is  consistent  with  the  notion  that 
distinct  classes  of  shareholders  differ  in  their  investment  objectives  and  capacities  to  influence  corporate 
behavior (Thomsen & Pedersen, 2000).   

Gedajlovic and Shapiro (2002) have followed Demsetz and Villalonga (2001) method. They modelled ownership 
structure,  first,  as  an  endogenous  variable  and  second,  they  examined  two  different  measures  of  ownership 
structure: (a) the fraction of shares owned by insiders (top management, CEO, board members) and (b) fraction 
of  shares  owned  by  important  outside  investors.  Their  findings  indicate  that  there  exists  a  linear  positive 
relationship between profitability and ownership structure. Furthermore, their results suggests that the greater the 
degree  to  which  shares  are  concentrated  in  the  hands  of  outside  or  inside  shareholders,  the  more  effectively 
management behavior is monitored and disciplined, leading to better performance. In addition, their results prove 
the  endogeneity  of  ownership  structure,  where  profitability  is  a  positive  determinant  of  ownership  structure. 
There exists evidence that superior firm performance leads to an increase in the value of stock options owned by 
management or large shareholders, which if exercised, would increase their share ownership.   

Therefore,  based  on  these  different  views  and  findings,  there  seems  to  be  inconclusive  evidence  on  the 
relationship  between  ownership  structure  and  firm  efficiency.  This  situation  has  captured  our  interest  to 
investigate the issue further. In this study, specifically, we consider the effect of ownership concentration on firm 
performance,  specifically  on  firm  efficiency.  In  addition,  since  the  majority  of  the  studies  on  the  relationship 
between  ownership  structure  and  firm  performance  have  been  on  firms  in  the  developed  countries,  our  study 
aims  to  extend  previous  knowledge  by  examining  this  relationship  in  a  developing  country.  Malaysia  is  a 
developing country which provides a rich setting for exploring this issue further. To the best of our knowledge,

this  kind  of  study  has  not  been  done  extensively  in  Malaysia.  Amongst  the  few  studies  on  the  issue  in  the 
Malaysian  setting  include  Abdul  Samad  (2002),  Haniffa  and  Hudaib  (2006),  Chang  and  Shazali  (2005),  and 
Faizah (2006).   

3. Methodology 

This  study  was  carried  out  using  secondary  data  from  a  sample  of 156 firms  which were  listed  on  the  KLSE. 
Unbalanced panel data of listed firms over the period 2000 through 2010 were used in our analysis. The sample 
firms were selected using the stratified random sampling method. Data were gathered from Datastream and also 
from published reports of the selected companies. The final sample consists of firms from the consumer products, 
industrial products, construction, trading/services and properties sectors. Other sectors were dropped because the 
required data on output and inputs were not available for all the years of the study.   

Ownership  structure  is  measured  using  three  concentrations  of  equity  ownership  namely,  one-ownership 
concentration  ratio  (CR1),  two-ownership  concentration  ratio  (CR2),  and  four-ownership  concentration  ratio 
(CR4). The calculations of these concentrations are based on the analysis of shareholdings section disclosed in 
the  firms’  annual  reports.  This  operationalization  of  ownership  concentration  concept  has  been  widely  used  in 
previous  researches  such  as  by  McConnel  and  Servaes  (1990),  Leech  and  Leahy  (1991),  and  Claessens  et  al. 
(1999).  Meanwhile,  firm  efficiency  score  is  measured  by  the  non-parametric  method,  Data  Envelopment 
Analysis  (DEA).  The  DEA  approach  was  chosen  over  the  Stochastic  Frontier  Analysis  (SFA)  which  is  a 
parametric  approach  since  the  former  does  not  require  the  functional  form  and  the  distribution  type  to  be 
assumed  in  advance.  The  DEA  was  originally  developed  by  Farrel  (1957)  and  subsequently  extended  and 
reformulated by Charnes, Fooper and Rhodes (1978). The DEA method by Charnes et al. is considered suitable 
for this study since it measures the efficiency of a micro unit relative to the efficiency of all the other micro units, 
assuming that all micro units are on or below the frontier. In the DEA method, constant returns to scale (CRS) 
and variable returns to scale (VRS) were employed to estimate firms’ efficiency scores. The estimated model for 
technical efficiency is illustrated by Equation (1).

One of the most important steps in the estimation of efficiency is in the selection of input and output variables to 
be  used  in  the  DEA  model.  Physical  measures  and  monetary  measures  are  common  types  of  input/output 
variables.  We  used  monetary  measures  for  three  reasons.  First,  it  is  difficult  to  obtain  variable  information  in 
physical units. Second, following Battese and Coelli (1995), it is preferable to use monetary measures to measure 
efficiency  at  the  firm  level  since  a  firm  is  often  engaged  in  many  different  activities.  Third,  using  monetary 
measures may capture more information compared to physical measures. Thus, consistent with Feroz, Kim and 
Raab (2003), we chose two conventional input variables (wages and salaries as a measure of labour expenses, 
expenses on land, building and equipment, and interest expenses and one conventional output variable (revenue) 
in our DEA model.

4. Discussion of Results 

Four sectors, namely consumer products, industrial products, construction, and trading/services were selected as 
the unit of analysis. The number of firms in the sample is determined by the proportion of firms in each sector to 
the entire firms registered on the KLSE. Firms in the trading/services sector (58 firms or 37.2%) represent the 
highest  proportion  of  firms  in  the  sample,  followed  by  the  industrial  products  sector  (57  firms  or  36.5%), 
consumer products (29 firms or 18.6%), and construction (12 firms or 7.7%).   

Our  investigation  of  ownership  structure  data  reveals  that  the  concentration  of  equity  ownership  in  the  156 
public-listed firms varies widely. The outcomes of the investigation are shown in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. 
Table 1 shows that industrial products, construction and trading/services have the highest share controlled by the 
single largest shareholder at the percentage shareholder range of 11 – 30%. There are 69 firms (44.23%) of the 
total firms that fall within this range across the sectors. Meanwhile, the consumer products sector has the single 
largest shareholder in the percentage shareholder range of 31 – 50%, the second largest ownership range. The 
total number of firms in this percentage shareholder range is 15 firms (51.70%) of total firms in this sector.   

Meanwhile,  Table  2  shows  that  highest  share  percentage  controlled  by  the  top  two  largest  shareholders  falls 
within  the  31  –  50%  range.  In  general,  industrial  products  and  trading/services  sectors  have  the  highest 
percentage shareholder distribution in this range. The total number of firms in this range is 57 firms (36.54%). 
Of the total firms that fall within this percentage range, the industrial product sector represents 40.35% of the 
firms, construction 10.53%, and trading/ services 31.58%. The highest share percentage for consumer products 
sector is in the 51 – 70% range. There are 13 firms which fall in this category, which constitute 44.83% of firms 
in this sector.   

Extending the shareholding analysis to the top four largest shareholders, the study found that 69 of the 156 firms 
or  44.23%  of  the  sample  firms  have  between  31  –  50%  of  shares  controlled  by  the  four  largest  shareholders 
(shown  in  Table  3).  Only  one  firm,  in  trading/services  has  more  than  90%  of  shares  in  the  hands  of  the  four 
largest shareholders.

Furthermore,  Table  4  shows  the  descriptive  statistic  of  estimated  efficiency  score  for  all  sectors.  Comparisons 
across  sectors  are  made  so  as  to  highlight  the  variation  in  scores  across  different  industries  within  the  KLSE. 
EFF1INCRS and EFF1INVRS refer to efficiency score assuming CRS and VRS, respectively. It is clear that the 
mean of estimated efficiency score of EFF1INCRS for trading/services, at 0.032, is the highest compared to the 
other sectors. The maximum value of estimated EFF1INCRS score for consumer products and trading/services 
recorded the extreme value of efficiency, or 1.000. At the same  time, trading/services sector also recorded the 
lowest minimum value of estimated EFF1INCRS score. Meanwhile, the mean of estimated EFF1INVRS scores 
are between 0.187 and 0.222. Consumer products, industrial products and trading/services sectors recorded the 
highest  maximum  value  of  EFF1INVRS  scores,  or  1.000.  The  lowest  minimum  value  of  EFF1INVRS  score  is 
recorded  by  the  consumer  products  sector.  The  comparison  between  sectors  is  made  to  gain  a  greater 
understanding of the actual scenario of firms’ ownership structure and efficiency in Malaysia and to explore their 
variations across sectors. The difference in efficiencies may be due to the different ownership structure in each 
sector.

In  summary,  our  findings  have  portrayed  the  variation  in  firm  ownership  structures  and  efficiencies  across 
sectors. Based on Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, either industrial products or trading/services has the top largest 
shareholders  in  each  bracket  of  ownership  concentration.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  estimates  of 
efficiency score in Table 4 where industrial products and trading/services sectors have the highest score under 
CRS and VRS assumptions, respectively . Therefore, based on this evidence, it seems that ownership structure 
may influence firms’ efficiency. In other words, a sector which has a high concentration of ownership may tend 
to be efficient.   

In the present study, the distribution of ownership is classified into three categories: the share concentration of 
the single largest, the top two largest, and the top four largest shareholders in each sector. In the first category, 
the  largest  proportion  of  firms  in  the  industrial  products,  construction,  and  trading/services  have  a  share 
concentration  in  the  11  –  30%  range.  However,  the  largest  number  of  firms  in  consumer  products  has  a  share 
concentration in the 31 – 50% range. The picture changes for the second and third category of ownership. The 
highest  proportion  of  firms  in  the  industrial  products,  construction,  and  trading/services  have  a  share 
concentration in the 31 – 50% range. On the other hand, the largest proportion of consumer product firms has a 
share concentration in the 51 – 70% range.

5. Policy Implications   

Based on the results of the analyses presented and discussed in the previous sections, this study has been able to 
provide a clearer picture of the relationship between firms’ ownership structure and efficiency in Malaysia. The 
findings of this study provide support for the hypothesis that firm efficiency is largely affected by its pattern of 
ownership structure. Firm efficiency is caused mainly by high concentration of ownership structure. Since large 
shareholders are a common phenomenon in Malaysian firms, this would be an important issue to be pondered by 
the government in their pursuit to strengthen corporate governance practices. Although the evidence implies that 
Malaysian firms may generate higher efficiency through large ownership, consistent with Jensen and Meckling 
(1976), this result is in contrast with findings of Burkart, Gromb, Panunzi (1997) and Hill and Snell (1988) who 
argued that over concentration of ownership may prove to be an obstacle in exploiting growth opportunities as 
well  as  discouraging  innovation  and  management  initiative,  when  such  situation  require  greater  provision  of 
capital and risk taking. Further, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) have argued that in corporate systems with a high 
ownership  concentration,  the  minority  shareholders  may  suffer  risk  expropriation  of  wealth  from  majority 
shareholders. Such expropriation merely aggravates the agency problem and reduces the firm’s market value.   

Through time, Malaysia’s economic strength is becoming rooted in its industrial base and it is currently moving 
to  a  higher  value-added  service-based  economy.  As  the  Malaysian  economy  moves  towards  becoming  a 
high-income economy, Malaysian firms face many key challenges in their quest to enhance business activities 
and profitability. Consequently, Malaysian firms need to be strengthened in terms of their corporate governance 
practices  so  as  to  ensure  efficiency  improvements.  Their  improved  performance  will  subsequently  help  the 
country achieve high economic performance.    

6. Conclusion 

Ownership structure and firm efficiency are regarded as important fundamental issues in corporate governance. 
The  literature  on  the  effect  of  ownership  structure  has  devoted  much  attention  on  firm  performance  but  paid 
scant  attention  to  firm  efficiency.  Therefore,  our  study  of  firm  efficiency  across  different  types  of  ownership 
structure attempts to fill the gap in the literature by providing new evidence on firm efficiency in Malaysia. As 
estimated  using  DEA  model,  this  study  has  shown  that  firms  with  high  ownership  concentration  appear  to 
experience a higher efficiency compared to firms with low ownership concentration. Therefore, the government 
should ensure that Malaysian firms enhance their corporate governance practices in order to improve efficiency.
