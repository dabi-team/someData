Abstract—Fixed low-resolution Analog to Digital Converters
(ADC) help reduce the power consumption in millimeter-wave
Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (Ma-MIMO) receivers
operating at large bandwidths. However, they do not guaran-
tee optimal Energy Efﬁciency (EE). It has been shown that
adopting variable-resolution (VR) ADCs in Ma-MIMO receivers
can improve performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and
throughput while providing better EE. In this paper, we present
an optimal energy-efﬁcient bit allocation (BA) algorithm for
Ma-MIMO receivers equipped with VR ADCs under a power
constraint. We derive an expression for EE as a function of
the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound on the MSE of the received,
combined, and quantized signal. An optimal BA condition is
derived by maximizing EE under a power constraint. We show
that the optimal BA thus obtained is exactly the same as that
obtained using the brute-force BA with a signiﬁcant reduction
in computational complexity. We also study the EE performance
and computational complexity of a heuristic algorithm that yields
a near-optimal solution.

I. INTRODUCTION

Today’s telecommunication networks contribute to 2% of
the total carbon dioxide emissions [1], [2]. The radio access
network contributes about 92% of the total power consumption
[3], [4]. Studies show that 5G base stations require about
three times the power of 4G base stations [3]. One of the
5G standards’ goals is to improve the overall network energy
efﬁciency (EE). The 5G standards have set a goal of 100x
improvement in network EE compared to the existing 4G-
LTE networks [5]. Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
(Ma-MIMO) technology is considered both at sub-6Ghz and
millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. In both scenarios,
a large number of antennas help to increase the capacity of
the system. Millimeter-wave Ma-MIMO is considered for the
back-haul wireless interconnects between the Base Stations
(BS), to achieve high throughput and spectral efﬁciency. How-
ever, this comes at the cost of increased power consumption,
resulting in poor EE [6], [7].

As envisioned by the 5G standards, network densiﬁcation
ramiﬁcations are a complex heterogeneous network (HetNet)
consisting of many small- and medium-sized cells, and macro-
cells. The Single-User (SU) Ma-MIMO framework forms
the backbone of communication links between the back-haul
HetNet elements [8]. By splitting the precoding and combining
between analog and digital domains (hybrid precoding and
combining), the number of RF paths can be reduced consid-
erably as compared to the number of transmit and receive
antennas [9], [10]. Despite adopting hybrid combing at the

receiver, the system’s overall energy efﬁciency is poor because
the analog to digital converters (ADC) operating at such large
bandwidths and high bit-resolution consume a large amount
of power [6], [9], [11]. In addition to power consumption,
high-resolution ADCs operating at high sampling frequencies
produce huge amounts of data that are difﬁcult to handle.
Using ﬁxed low-resolution ADCs is a popular approach
adopted in Ma-MIMO receiver architectures to mitigate large
power demands [12]. However, an optimal EE performance
is necessary to meet the stringent demands set out by the 5G
standards [3], [5]. Adopting variable-resolution (VR) ADCs in
Ma-MIMO settings yields such beneﬁts [13]–[16].

A. Previous Works

Low-resolution ADC MIMO receiver architectures using 1-
bit and ﬁxed n-bit frameworks have been studied extensively
over the last few years [12], [17]–[20]. Overall, the 1-bit ADC
receiver architecture in MIMO receivers has been shown to
improve EE; however, at the cost of performance at medium
to high SNR regimes for a broad set of system parameters
like the number of transmit or receive antennas, the order of
modulation used, and channel distribution. For example, it has
been shown that despite improved deployment cost, there is
considerable rate loss in the medium to high SNR regimes with
1-bit ADC architectures [12]. It has also been shown that by a
small increase in the resolution of ADCs (eg., with 3 bits) on
all RF paths, signiﬁcant performance gains can be achieved
for a broad range of system parameters [21]. Also, there is
performance degradation due to channel estimation using low-
resolution ADCs [22]. A practical channel estimation approach
under the impact of ADC quantization is considered in [23],
[24] (in addition to the data transmission stage). The uplink
performance evaluation of a multiuser Ma-MIMO system with
spatially correlated channels using low-resolution ADCs at the
base station is presented in [25].

All the papers above use ﬁxed-bit-resolution ADCs on the
receiver’s RF paths. Since the resolutions of ADCs are ﬁxed
and low, an optimal EE performance is not guaranteed for
a given channel. From the simulations in [13]–[16], it can
be seen that by varying the ADC resolutions on each RF
path for a given channel condition and receiver power budget,
optimal performance is obtained. Thus, employing VR ADCs
on the receiver’s RF paths can be advantageous. The VR ADCs
employed should have the ability to change bit resolutions
across coherence time. Here, the novel VR ADC architec-
tures and mixed-ADC-bank hardware structures proposed in

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
previous works can be considered [26], [27]. An ADC Bit
Allocation (BA) mechanism that decides on the bit resolution
to be used on a given RF path and coherence duration is
consequential in achieving optimal EE. Another advantage of
employing VR ADCs along with an optimal BA scheme is that
a high-resolution ADC can be brought into the signal path
during the pilot signal acquisition, thereby removing the ill
effects of low-resolution ADCs on channel estimation. Also,
the absence of doppler due to the communication between
ﬁxed network elements in a wireless backhaul ensures longer
coherence durations even at mmWave frequencies [28], [29].
This relaxes the requirement for faster switching of ADC bit
resolutions between coherence frames and makes the adoption
of VR ADCs in the mmWave wireless backhaul more amicable
[27].On the other hand, the hardware cost of the novel VR
ADC architectures may be higher. However, the energy saving
and the long term positive environmental beneﬁts of achieving
optimal EE underscores the initial higher cost disadvantage.

A BA mechanism based on minimizing the Mean Square
Quantization Error (MSQE) under the receiver power con-
straint
is presented in [13]. A BA mechanism based on
the mean squared error (MSE) minimization under a power
constraint using a Genetic Algorithm was proposed in [14]. An
optimal BA based on MSE minimization for a SU mmWave
Ma-MIMO channel under a power constraint was derived in
[15]. A similar Algorithm based on channel capacity max-
imization was derived in [16]. In a more recent paper by
Kaushik et al., a joint BA and hybrid beamforming strategy
is proposed [30]. In this work, the BA is jointly designed for
both digital to analog converts (DAC) and ADCs, along with
hybrid precoder and combiner, thus effectively improving the
overall EE. It is also shown that the DAC/ADC BA is dynamic
during operation and achieves higher EE when compared
with existing benchmark techniques that use ﬁxed DAC and
ADC bit resolutions [30]. The authors in [30] propose a
novel alternating direction method of multipliers to optimize
hybrid precoder, combiner, and BA matrices jointly for both
ADC/DAC, thus achieving lower computational complexity.
In the proposed work, we focus mainly on the optimal ADC
BA for EE, and hence the computational complexity of our
proposed algorithm may not be as good as that of [30].

B. Our Contribution

The contributions of this paper are as follows:
• We propose an ADC BA scheme whose solution is
precisely the same as that obtained using the brute-force
or exhaustive search (ES) BA with an order of magnitude
reduction in multiplication complexity. This provides for
optimal EE performance under a power constraint for a
SU Ma-MIMO wireless back-haul framework.

• For the ﬁrst time, we derive an analytical expression
for EE as a function of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB) on MSE of the received, quantized, and com-
bined signal. Using this expression, we derive the pro-
posed ADC BA algorithm.

• We also propose a heuristic algorithm using simulated
annealing (SA) that is near-optimal. The parameters of the

2

SA algorithm can be tuned to trade off the EE optimality
and computational complexity.

Notation: The column vectors are represented as boldface
small letters and matrices as boldface uppercase letters. The
primary diagonal of a matrix is denoted as diag(·), and all
expectations E[·] are over the random variable n, which
is an AWGN vector, i.e., E[·] = En[·]. The multivariate
normal distribution with mean µ and covariance ϕ is denoted
as N (µ, ϕ) and CN (0, ϕ) denotes a multivariate complex-
valued circularly-symmetric Gaussian distribution. The trace
of a matrix A is shown as tr (A) and the N × N identity
matrix as IN . The term h(x) deﬁnes the differential entropy
of a continuous random variable x. The superscripts T and H
denote transpose and Hermitian transpose, respectively. The
terms I, R, and C indicate the set of integer, real, and complex
numbers, respectively.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the system model and parameters. In Section III,
we derive the optimal BA conditions for EE. The Section IV
describes the two proposed Algorithms based on the optimal
condition derived in Section III. In Section V, we present the
simulation results, and in Section VI, we study and compare
the computational complexities, followed by the conclusions
in Section VII. Theorems and their proofs are presented in the
Appendices.

II. SIGNAL MODEL

The signal model for a typical SU Ma-MIMO transceiver
with hybrid precoding and combining is shown in Figure
1. This signal model forms an underlying framework for
wireless backhaul communication link between basestations
in a HetNet [6], [7]. In Figure 1, FD and FA denote the
digital and analog precoders, respectively. Similarly, WH
D and
WH
A represent the digital and analog combiners, respectively.
The vector x is an Ns × 1 transmitted signal vector with unit
average power. Let Nrt and Nrs denote the number of RF
chains at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Also, Nt
and Nr represent the number of transmit and receive antennas,
respectively. The channel matrix H = [hij] is an (Nr × Nt)
matrix representing the line of sight mmWave Ma-MIMO
channel with properties deﬁned in [29] (chapter 3, pages 99-
125).

The transmitted signal ˜x and the received signal r are
thus known as ˜x = FAFDx and r = H˜x + n. Here, n
is an Nr × 1 noise vector of independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian random variables such
that n ∼ CN (0, σ2
nINr ). The received symbol vector r is

A r and later digi-
tized using a variable-bit quantizer to produce ˜y = Qb(z) =
Wα(b)z + nq [13]. This signal is combined using the digital
combiner WH
D ˜y. The
quantizer is modeled as an Additive Quantization Noise Model
(AQNM) [11], [31]. Here b = [b1b2b3....bN ]T is a vector
whose entries bi indicate the number of bits (on both I and
Q channels) that are allocated to the ADC on RF path i. The
bits bi ∈ I take values between 1 and Nb. The vector nq has
a distribution of CN (0, D2
q) and is uncorrelated with z [11],
[31].

Hence, the relationship between the transmitted signal vec-
tor x and the received symbol vector y at the receiver is given
by

With the diagonal BA matrix Wα(b), we intend to design
the precoders FD, FA, and Combiners WH

with the ADC BA Wα(b) for a given channel realization H.
We assume perfect CSI at the transmitter. We further assume
that Nrs = Ns and the extension to the case Nrs 6= Ns is
straightforward.

III. ENERGY-EFFICIENT BIT-ALLOCATION DESIGN

We ﬁrst present an expression for the CRLB on the MSE
that can be achieved on the received, combined, and quan-
tized signal y in (1). We then derive the expression for the
information rate as a function of the CRLB. The CRLB is a
function of the hybrid precoder, hybrid combiner, and the BA
matrix. We derive the expression for EE using the information
rate. An optimal BA condition is arrived by maximizing the
EE under a power constraint.

A. CRLB on MSE as a function of BA

B. Energy efﬁciency as a function of bit allocation

In this section, we ﬁrst derive the expression for the
information rate of the SU mmWave Ma-MIMO channel
encompassing the channel matrix H, the hybrid precoders FD,
FA, and the hybrid combiners WH
A along with the BA
matrix Wα. We then use the information rate to arrive at an
expression for EE. Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed as

y = Kx + n1,
where n1 = WH
A n + WH
D nq. Here n is an additive
noise vector that is multivariate Gaussian distributed as n ∼
CN (0, σ2
nINr ). Inspired by [11], [20], [31], [32], we assume
that nq has Gaussian distribution such that nq ∼ N (0, D2
q).
This results in n1 having the distribution N (0, Φ) where
Φ = σ2
qWD [15]. We assume that x and
n1 are independent, and is a valid assumption because of the
following reasons. The input symbol vector can be modeled
as x ∼ CN (0, pINs) [11], [13]. This can be achieved using
efﬁcient Gaussian scramblers [33]. It is straightforward to
see that n1 and x are independent, given that n1 and x
are multivariate Gaussian vectors that are uncorrelated. The
information rate for the given Ma-MIMO channel can be
written as

D D2

R(b) = I(x; y) = h(y) − h(y|x)
(a)
= h(y) − h(n1),

= h(y) − h(Kx + n1|x)

(8)

where I(x; y) is the mutual information of random variables
x and y, and K is a function of BA vector b. (a) holds if
and only if both nq and x are Gaussian. Hence, ensures y
is Gaussian. However, under the assumption that either nq or
x being non Gaussian, ﬁnding a closed form expression of
the considered information rate (8) is an open problem. Now,
if y ∈ CNs, then the differential entropy h(y) is less than
or equal to log2 det(πeQ) with equality if and only if y is
circularly symmetric complex Gaussian with E[yyH ] = Q
[34]. As such,

Note that Φ = σ2

h(n1) ≤ log2 det(πeΦ).

(10)

We show that n1 is a circularly symmetric jointly Complex
Gaussian vector using Theorem 1 in the Appendix. Hence, we
can write

h(n1) = log2 det(πeΦ).

(11)

Thus, the information rate I(x; y) achieved can be written as

R(b) = h(y) − h(n1)

(b)
= log2 det(πeQ) − log2 det(πeΦ)

= log2 det

(12)
(cid:17)

where (b) follows from the assumption that the input symbol
vector x is circular symmetric Gaussian vector that could be
modeled as x ∼ CN (0, pINs) [11], [13]. It is straightforward
to see that (12) is a general case of (17) in [9] when the BA
is inﬁnite-bits on all ADCs. We simplify (12) to write the
information rate as

number of multiplications and additions, which is discussed
in Section VI.

C. Hybrid combiner structure

Phase shifters or splitters impose constraints on the design
A [9]. We express the constrained

A =

A and the digital combiner WD, such that

B. Simulated annealing

The SA is a metaheuristic technique used to solve global
optimization problems. While it does not guarantee an optimal
solution, tuning its parameters such as the cooling factor can
ensure near-optimal solutions [38]. The SA algorithm has a
reduced complexity compared to the Q-search method and
is discussed in Section VI. The details of the Algorithm 2
presented below can be found in [38].

We simulate the mmWave channel using the NYUSIM
channel simulator for two channel scenarios. In one, we have
2 dominant scatters, and in other we have one dominant scatter
[39]. The parameter conﬁgurations for the simulations is given
in Table I. We consider Nb = 4, Ns = 8, and Ns = 12 in
our simulations. We run the simulations to evaluate the EE
(ηEE) derived in (14) (Figures 2-5), and the information rate
R derived in (13) (Figures 6-9) at various SNRs for Ns = 8
and Ns = 12. Monte-Carlo simulations are run with 1-bit
ADCs (represented using lines-(a)) and 2-Bit ADCs (line-(b))
across all RF paths. The simulations are also run using the
proposed Q-Search (line-(d)), SA (lines-(e) and (f)), and ES
(line-(c)) method.

The Q-search Algorithm always yields the optimal BA. That
is, the BA solution evaluated using the proposed Q-search
method is exactly the same as that of the ES method. The

In this section, we evaluate the computational complexity
in terms of the number of multiplications and additions for
the following Algorithms (i) ES BA (ii) proposed Q-search
method (iii) proposed SA Algorithm with two cooling factors.
(i) ES Bit-Allocation: It can be seen that ES BA requires
γ(N 2
s real multiplica-
tions, and γ(Ns(Ns − 1) + Ns) complex additions. Here γ
is the number of EE (ηEE) evaluations and is approximately
the cardinality of Bset, which is N Ns
. Thus ES BA has a
multiplicative and additive complexity of O(N Ns
) and thus is
NP-Hard.
(ii) Q-search Method: The term q(bi) in (24) is precomputed
for given Nb and Ns. This consists of a table of Nb × Ns
real values Q(Nb, Ns). This requires the computation of
li = diag[WH
D Σ2WD + INs] that require in 3N 2
s real multi-
plications and 2N 2
s + Ns(Ns − 1) real additions. To compute
Kf (bj ) and Ptot() as described in Algorithm 1 for all BA’s
in Bset we require 2µ(Ns + 1) real additions. Thus, a total of
3N 2
s +NsNb+µ(Ns−1)
real additions are required. Here µ is the number of evaluations
of Kf (bj), which is approximately the cardinality of Bset,
which is N Ns
b
term − log2(2cfs) −
table
Ns
log2( PT +PR
i=1 2bi ) is precomputed and stored as Ptot()
2cfs
for all BA’s in Bset. This only requires additions and no mul-
tiplications. The term PT +PR
is independent of BA. The term
Ns
i=1 SHIFTLEFT(1, bi).
The log2() can be performed using shift operation and a
P
lookup table [37]. The ratio R(b)
p(b) is computed without multi-
plication as illustrated on the line-9 of Algorithm 1. Thus Q-
search method suffers from considerable additive complexity
of O(N Ns
). However, it has an order of magnitude reduction
in multiplicative complexity, which is O(N 2
s ) compared to
the Q-search method requires only real
ES BA. Besides,
multiplications.
(iii) SA Algorithm: The terms Q(Nb, Ns) and Ptot() is
precomputed and stored similar to the Q-search method. Thus
s real multiplications and 2N 2
resulting in 3N 2
s + Ns(Ns − 1)
real additions. However, in SA the Kf (bj) is not evaluated
′s
for all b
j ∈ Bset as in Q-search method. The number of
evaluations (µ) of Kf (bj ) depends on the initial temperature
T0 and the cooling factor r. From Algorithm 2, it can be seen
that µ =
(2Ns +5)
real additions. Here m is the number of search at a given
temperature t. Hence,
the additive complexity of SA can
be tuned to O(N D
s ) using the parameters T and r. The
complexity degree of Ns is D and can be derived using the
relationship T , r−N D−1
. In our simulations, we ﬁx T and
set r = 0.9 and r = 0.5 that correspond to additive complexity
of O(N 3
s ), respectively. The generation of random
numbers is carefully designed and has O(1) complexity. The
computation of the acceptance probability Pa, which is a
sigmoid function is a lookup table with O(1). In conclusion,
the SA Algorithm has a real-multiplication complexity of
O(N 2
b ) and an additive complexity that depends on the initial
temperature T and cooling factor r.

VII. CONCLUSION

For a given power budget, an EE-optimal receiver with
reduced computational complexity is crucial to meet the targets
set by the 5G standards in terms of the network energy
efﬁciency and spectral efﬁciency. In this paper, we propose
an EE-optimal BA algorithm whose solution is precisely the
same as the exhaustive search, with an order of magnitude
improvement in multiplicative complexity. Also, we propose a
heuristic algorithm using simulated annealing, whose parame-
ters can be tuned to trade off EE optimality with computational
complexity. Both algorithms are based on our optimal EE con-
ditions expressed as a function of BA under a power constraint.
We analyze the computational complexities of the proposed
methods against ES. The computational complexity of SA is
signiﬁcantly lower than the Q-search method. However, this
comes at the cost of no optimality guarantees.

Theorem 1. If n1 = WH
D nq, where n

is n ∼ CN (0, σ2
q =
WαW1−αdiag[WH

that n1 is a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG)
vector. That is, n1 ∼ CN (0, Φ).

A n + WH

A H(WH

Proof. The condition for the random vector n1 to be CSCG
is [41]

where w ∼ CN (0, INs). This leads to E[nq] = DqE[w] = 0
q ] = DqE[wwT ]Dq = 0. Hence nq is circularly
and E[nqnT
symmetric jointly Gaussian random vector. nq ∼ CN (0, D2
q).
Using (A.27), we can express n1 as

n1 = WH

DWαWH

A n + WH

D Dqw

(A.28)

Since we have n and w as i.i.d complex Gaussian vectors, we
can write

E[nnT ] = E[wnT ] = E[nwH ] = E[wnH ] = 0,
nINs, E[wwH ] = INs.
E[nnH ] = σ2

(A.29)

Thus, we arrive at

(A.26)

Thus, n1 ∼ CN (0, Φ) is a CSCG vector.

Here, E[n1nT

nq is CSCG distributed as nq ∼ N (0, D2
q =

A H(WH

matrix D2
A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a random vector nq
to be a CSCG random vector is that it has the form nq = Aw
where w is iid complex Gaussian, that is w ∼ CN (0, INs)
and A is an arbitrary complex matrix [41], [42]. Since D2
q is
a positive real diagonal matrix, we can express

q being positive real diagonal.

It is to be noted that for n ≥ 2 and larger values of k, the term

(cid:16)

Using the Taylor series at g(xi = x0) = 1 =

Also:
