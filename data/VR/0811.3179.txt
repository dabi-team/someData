ABSTRACT

The Galactic Centre (GC) has experienced a high degree of recent star-
forming activity, as evidenced by the large number of massive stars currently
residing there. The relative abundances of chemical elements in the GC may
provide insights into the origins of this activity. Here, we present high-resolution
H-band spectra of two Red Supergiants in the GC (IRS 7 and VR 5-7), and in
combination with spectral synthesis we derive abundances for Fe and C, as well as
other α-elements Ca, Si, Mg Ti and O. We ﬁnd that the C-depletion in VR 5-7 is
consistent with the predictions of evolutionary models of RSGs, while the heavy
depletion of C and O in IRS 7’s atmosphere is indicative of deep mixing, possibly
due to fast initial rotation and/or enhanced mass-loss. Our results indicate that
the current surface Fe/H content of each star is slightly above Solar. However,
comparisons to evolutionary models indicate that the initial Fe/H ratio was likely
closer to Solar, and has been driven higher by H-depletion at the stars’ surface.
Overall, we ﬁnd α/Fe ratios for both stars which are consistent with the thin
Galactic disk. These results are consistent with other chemical studies of the

GC, given the precision to which abundances can currently be determined. We
argue that the GC abundances are consistent with a scenario in which the recent
star-forming activity in the GC was fuelled by either material travelling down
the Bar from the inner disk, or from the winds of stars in the inner Bulge – with
no need to invoke top-heavy stellar Initial Mass Functions to explain anomalous
abundance ratios.

Introduction

Understanding the star-formation history at the Galactic Centre (GC) is key to un-
derstanding the Galaxy’s secular evolution. The inner 40 pc has clearly experienced a high
degree of recent star formation, apparent from the young stellar clusters residing there.
These clusters host some of the most massive stars known to exist in the Galaxy – the
Arches cluster (Figer et al. 2002), the Quintuplet cluster (Figer et al. 1999) and the Central
cluster (Paumard et al. 2006). It remains an open question how these clusters were formed,
given the harsh environment of the GC, or whether they were formed in situ in the GC at
all.

The key to answering this question may lie in chemical abundance measurements. By
probing the relative abundances of certain elements we may infer the star formation history
of the Galactic Centre. Broadly, α-elements (such as Mg, Ti, Ca, Si) are produced pre-
dominantly in the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of massive stars. Meanwhile, Fe-peak
elements are produced in Type-Ia SNe, that is the thermonuclear explosion of a low-mass
white dwarf which has accreted a suﬃcient amount of mass from a binary companion to
reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Hence, α enrichment happens on much shorter timescales
(∼10 Myrs), due to the comparitively brief lifetimes of massive stars; while Fe-enrichment
occurs on much longer timescales (∼Gyrs). In the Galaxy, the ratio of α/Fe is found to be
lower in the thin disk than in the other Galactic environments of the bulge and thick disk
(e.g. Bensby et al. 2004; Rich & Origlia 2005; Luck et al. 2006). This is commonly explained
as being due to the rapid formation of the bulge and halo, where star formation in the early
Galaxy was intense but brief, and the elevated α abundances from the early CCSNe were
‘frozen-in’. In the thin disk however, star formation has continued throughout the lifetime of
the Galaxy, allowing Type-Ia SNe to contribute to the chemical evolution, and driving the
α/Fe ratio to below that of the halo and bulge. Meanwhile, a gradient of increasing metal
content is found at lower Galacto-centric distances (RGC) within the disk (e.g. Luck et al.

– 3 –

2006), suggesting that the rate of star formation in the thin disk has been higher toward the
GC. However, the absence of suitable probes of metallicity inwards of RGC ≈ 4kpc, combined
with the large extiction towards the GC, have meant that it has been unclear whether the
trend of increasing metal content ﬂows all the way to the center of the Galaxy.

In recent years, advancements in infra-red astronomy have meant that it is now possible
to make abundance measurements of stars in the GC, in order to place this region within the
evolutionary framework of the whole Galaxy. Infra-red studies are necessary to work around
the 30 magnitudes of visual extinction toward the GC, with many such studies concentrating
on the large number of high-mass stars present there. Massive stars provide excellent probes
of chemical abundances; their spectra are rich in emission/absorption lines, while their short
lifetimes mean that they provide an up-to-date picture of the local metallicity.

In studies of hot stars, Najarro et al. (2004) and Martins et al. (2008) both attempted to
infer the initial O abundance of the Arches cluster from the asymptotic nitrogen abundances
of the cluster’s most evolved stars. When comparing the results of both studies to the latest
stellar evolutionary models, in which the relative abundance ratios of the heavy elements are
ﬁxed, each study suggests a slightly super-Solar global metal content Z/Z⊙, though neither
study was able to give abundances of speciﬁc α or Fe-peak elements.
In a study of two
Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) in the Quintuplet cluster Najarro et al. (2008) was able to
make direct measurements of Fe content, plus the α-elements Si and Mg. They found Fe to
be approximately Solar, while Si and Mg were enhanced by ≈ 0.3±0.2dex with respect to
Solar values. Geballe et al. (2006) studied the star IRS 8 in the Central cluster using low-
resolution K-band spectroscopy. They argued that the 2.116µm feature, which is thought
to be a blend of C iii, N iii and O iii transitions, was sensitive to O content, and used
it to derive an O abundance which was super-Solar at the 2σ level when compared to the
Asplund et al. (2005) Solar abundances1.

There have also been several studies of cool massive stars, speciﬁcally Red Supergiants
(RSGs). Carr et al. (2000) performed the ﬁrst abundance study of a star in the GC, mod-
elling the high resolution H and K spectrum of the Red Supergiant (RSG) in the Central
cluster IRS 7. They found approximately Solar values for Fe to within their quoted uncer-
tainties, with a depletion of O with respect to solar likely due to internal CNO processing.
Ram´ırez et al. (2000) analysed a further ﬁve RSGs in the central cluster, using K-band high
resolution data, again ﬁnding Fe content consistent with Solar. Ramirez et al. also stud-
ied the Quintuplet RSG VR5-7, ﬁnding an Fe abundance consistent with the rest of their

abundance is consistent with Solar.

– 4 –

sample. Cunha et al. (2007) analysed this same set of stars as the Ramirez et al. sample,
adding H-band spectra to the dataset. Again, Solar Fe content was found, but they also
found marginal evidence for α enhancement: the ratios of both O/Fe and Ca/Fe were found
to be above Solar at the 2σ level, again in comparison to the Asplund et al. Solar values.

Studies of GC Hii regions have also yielded marginal evidence for super-Solar α abun-
dances (Simpson et al. 1995; Rudolph et al. 2006). Analysis of X-ray spectroscopy of the
Sg A East supernova (SN) remnant by Sakano et al. (2004) shows strong evidence for α-
enrichment, however if the object is a remnant of a core-collapse SN one expects to see
signiﬁcant self-enrichment of the α-elements.

The results described above are all somewhat consistent with a picture of chemical
abundances in the GC which are Solar to within the uncertainties, with marginal evidence
for α-enhancement. Several authors have suggested that the super-Solar α/Fe ratio is real,
and is indicative of the star forming history in the GC. Several explanations have been
suggested to explain this result:

• A recent burst of star-formation produced a great number of massive stars, which
evolved to core-collapse SNe. This has enriched the local environment in α-elements,
an eﬀect which can now be seen in the surface abundances of subsequent generations
of stars. However, this is generally inconsistent with the mix of old, intermediate
and young stellar populations found in the GC. Analyses of the GC’s H-R diagram
and luminosity function have led various authors to argue for a constant rate of star-
formation over the last ∼Gyr, rather than an isolated burst (e.g. Blum et al. 2003;
Figer et al. 2004; Maness et al. 2007).

• The harsh environment of the GC results in a Jeans mass larger than in the rest of the
Galaxy, and produces a top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF) (Morris 1993). The
increased rate of CCSNe due to the higher fraction of massive stars results in a α/Fe
ratio above that of the disk. This is consistent with the results of Maness et al. (2007),
who argued for a top-heavy IMF when comparing the observed GC H-R diagram with
quantitative model predictions.

• The GC’s source of star-forming material is provided by the winds of Red Giants in
the Bulge, which tend to have high α/Fe ratios. Thus the natal material was already
α-enriched before it arrived at the GC (Morris & Serabyn 1996).

However, as stated above, the evidence for a high α/Fe ratio is marginal. Works which
study both the Fe and α content directly are limited to Cunha et al. (2007) and Najarro et al.

(2008); the former studied O and Ca, while the latter studied Si and Mg. Oxygen can be a
poor tracer of α abundances in massive stars, as to some extent it is processed by nuclear
burning and can give results which are not representative of the other α elements.

Here we present an abundance study of two of the GC RSGs, IRS 7 in the Central cluster
and VR 5-7 in the Quintuplet cluster. For the ﬁrst time we study a range of α-elements –
Ca, Si, Mg, O and Ti – while also studying Fe and C.

Our method is both independent and complementary to the previous studies of these
stars by Carr et al. (2000), Ram´ırez et al. (2000) and Cunha et al. (2007), providing full
spectral synthesis of the observed spectra and equivalent width measurements of selected
lines. This method has been proven to be eﬀective in determining chemical abundances of
low mass giants in the Galactic bulge (e.g. Origlia et al. 2002, 2005; Rich et al. 2007) as well
as of young stellar clusters dominated by red supergiants (Larsen et al. 2006, 2008).

We begin in Sect. 2 with a description of our observations and data-reduction steps,
followed by a description of our abundance analysis methods in Sect. 2.1. The results are
presented and discussed in Sect. 3.

2. Observations & data reduction

Observations were taken with NIRSPEC, the cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph mounted

on Keck-II, during the night of 3rd June 1999. We used the instrument in high-resolution
mode, with the NIRSPEC-5 ﬁlter, in conjunction with the 0.576′′ × 12′′ slit. The dispersion
angle was set to 62.53◦, with cross-dispersion angle set to 35.53◦. This gave us a spectral
resolution of ∼17,000 of select regions in the wavelength range of 1.5-1.7µm.

We integrated on each star for 20s in each of two nod-positions along the slit. In addition
to the cluster stars, we also observed HD 104337, a B2 IV star, as a telluric standard on each
night. Flat-ﬁelds were taken with a continuum lamp. For wavelength calibration purposes,
arc frames were taken with Ar, Ne, Xe and Kr lamps to provide as many template lines
as possible in the narrow wavelength range of each spectral order. As high-precision radial
velocity measurements were not required for this study, no etalon frames were taken.

We subtracted nod-pairs of frames to remove the sky background, dark current and
detector bias level. Each frame was then ﬂat-ﬁelded using the continuum-lamp exposures.
We corrected for the warping of each order in a process known as rectiﬁcation. The warping
in the spatial and dispersion directions were characterized by ﬁtting 3rd-degree polynomials
to the two star-traces in a nod-pair and the arc lines respectively. These ﬁts were then used

– 6 –

to resample each order onto a linear grid. As the arc-line wavelengths are known, this process
also wavelength-calibrates the data.

Cosmic ray hits and bad pixels were identiﬁed by taking the ratio of two spectra of
the same object, and identifying values lying outside 5σ of the residual spectrum. These
values were replaced with the median value of the three neighbouring pixels either side. We
removed the H and He i absorption features of the telluric standard via linear interpolation.
The atmospheric absorption features in the science frames were then removed by dividing
through by the telluric standard. Finally, the spectra were normalised by dividing through
by the median continuum value. The dense absorption-line spectra make signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) estimates diﬃcult, but we estimate from weak features we know are real that
the SNR is better than 100 for all stars observed.

2.1. Data analysis

Abundance analysis is performed by using full spectral synthesis techniques and equiv-
Indeed, at the NIRSPEC resolution of
alent width measurements of representative lines.
17,000 a few single roto-vibrational OH lines and CO bandheads can be measured and used
to derive accurate oxygen and carbon abundances. Abundances of other metals can be
derived from the atomic lines of Fe I, Mg I, Si I, Ti I, and Ca I.

Photometric estimates of the stellar parameters are initially used as input to compute
a grid of synthetic spectra of red supergiant stars with varying atmospheric parameters and
abundances, by using an updated (Origlia et al. 2002, 2003) version of the code described
in Origlia et al. (1993). Brieﬂy, the code uses the LTE approximation and is based on
molecular blanketed model atmospheres of Johnson et al. (1980). The code includes several
thousands of near IR atomic lines and molecular roto-vibrational transitions due to CO, OH
and CN. Three main compilations of atomic oscillator strengths are used, namely the Ku-
rucz database2, and those published by Biemont & Grevesse (1973) and Mel´endez & Barbuy
(1999).

Abundance estimates are mainly obtained by best-ﬁtting the full observed spectrum
and by measuring the equivalent widths of a few selected features, dominated by a speciﬁc
chemical element – see Table 1 for a list of some of the the diagnostic lines, along with their
oscillator stregths and excitation potentials. The H-band spectra of RSGs contain thousands
of absorption lines, and we concentrate on ﬁtting those spectral features which are relatively

– 7 –

unblended and which have reliable atomic/molecular data. We do not attempt to ﬁt features
which are blends of poorly-understood transitions. Typical equivalent width values of ﬁtted
features range between 300 and 800 m˚A with a conservative error of ±20 m˚A to also account
for a ±2% uncertainty in the continuum positioning.

For initial estimates of Teﬀ we use the values quoted by Cunha et al. (2007). We also use
the intrinsic luminosities determined in this paper in combination with the Geneva evolution-
ary models to estimate the surface gravity log g. The values of log g and the microturbulent
velocity ξ are ﬁne-tuned using the CO and OH lines, which are sensitive to these parameters.
We found that log g = 0.0 and ξ = 3 km s−1 provided good ﬁts for both stars.

We note that the parameter of macroturbulence is not speciﬁcally included in our current
analysis.
In previous spectral synthesis studies of the objects in this paper authors have
required the inclusion of macroturbulent velocities in the region of 15-25 km s−1. However,
as these values are comparable to the spectral resolution of our observations (18 km s−1),
we do not attempt to constrain this parameter. We do ﬁnd some evidence for an additional
broadening component in the spectrum of IRS 7, this is discussed further in Sect. 3.

The model which better reproduces the overall observed spectrum and the equivalent
widths of selected lines is chosen as the best ﬁt model for that particular spectrum.
In
order to check the statistical signiﬁcance of our best-ﬁt solution, we compute a set of six
test models with varying stellar parameters of Teﬀ =±200 K, log g = ±0.5dex, and ξ =
±1 km s−1. For each test model, the abundances A(X) are ﬁne-tuned to produce the best ﬁt
in that model, typically by ±0.2dex. We then compute the residuals between these models
and the observed spectrum. We ﬁnd that our best-ﬁt model always produces signiﬁcantly
lower residuals than the test models (see Fig. 2). This process was repeated with smaller
variations in the stellar parameters of the test models until we found a set of test models
which produced residuals comparable to those of the best-ﬁt model. We found that models
with δTeﬀ=±100 K, δ(log g) = ±0.3dex) and δξ = ±0.5 km s−1 had the same statistical
signiﬁcance as our best-ﬁt model . We adopt these values as the experimental uncertainties
in each parameter. The uncertainties in abundance levels varies from element to element,
and depends on other factors such as blending and continuum placing. The abundance
uncertainties are typically in the range 0.1-0.2dex.

the diagnostic lines without the inclusion of any additional broadening. Therefore, any
macroturbulence present must be below or comparable to the instrumental broadening – the
spectral resolution of our observations, 18 km s−1. This is consistent with previous studies
of this object at higher spectral resolution, which have required macroturbulent velocities of
12-15 km s−1 (Ram´ırez et al. 2000; Cunha et al. 2007).

For IRS 7, we found that the ﬁt could be improved by convolving the spectrum with
a broadening proﬁle – either using a Doppler proﬁle of 20 km s−1, or by increasing the
gaussian (instrumental) broadening to 27 km s−1. These values are consistent with macro-
turbulent velocities of 20-25 km s−1 used by Ramirez et al. and Cunha et al. in their ﬁts
to higher resolution spectra. The ﬁt to IRS 7 shown in Fig. 1 includes this extra Doppler

for IRS 7 as for VR 5-7, and this is reﬂected in the slightly increased uncertainties in the
derived elemental abundances. One possible explanation for this could be the interaction
of the star’s outer atmosphere with nearby hot stars, augmenting the ionization structure
and/or inducing departures from spherical symmetry in IRS 7’s envelope (Serabyn et al.
1991; Yusef-Zadeh & Morris 1991; Yusef-Zadeh & Melia 1992).

In Table 2, the derived abundances are shown for each element studied, as well as the
derived stellar temperature. We ﬁnd temperatures gravities and microturbulent velocities
for each star which are in good agreement with previous studies of the same objects. We
quantify the abundance of each element X in the form A(X) = log(X/H) + 12. We also
tabulate the abundances derived for the same stars by other authors using independent meth-
ods. Finally, we also show the average abundances derived for the stars’ host clusters from
other independent studies in the literature. Below, we describe the elemental abundances
individually.

From Table 2 we see that the Fe abundances we derive are in excellent agreement with
previous studies of the same objects. They are also consistent with the average abundances
of their host clusters: our measurement of A(Fe) = 7.59 ± 0.10 for IRS 7 agrees perfectly
with the average A(Fe) of 10 RSGs in the Central cluster studied by Cunha et al. (2007,
¯A(Fe) = 7.59±0.15), and the 9 RSGs observed by Ram´ırez et al. (2000, ¯A(Fe) = 7.61±0.22).
Our measurement for VR 5-7 (A(Fe) = 7.55 ± 0.10) is also consistent with the average of
the two LBVs studied by Najarro et al. (2008, ¯A(Fe) = 7.54 ± 0.15).

When comparing the measured Fe composition for the two GC RSGs to Solar abun-
dances, we use the latest Solar Fe composition from the 3-D Solar model of Asplund et al.
(2005, see Table 2). We ﬁnd Fe abundances with respect to Solar [Fe/H] of +0.14 ± 0.11
for IRS 7, and +0.10 ± 0.11 for VR 5-7, where the uncertainties are the quadrature sum
of those in our measurements and those in the Solar values. Neither of these values rep-
resent a statistically-signiﬁcant detection of a departure from Solar abundances. In order
to minimise uncertainties, we consider our analysis in combination with previous studies
whose analysis techniques were complementary to our own. As the studies by Carr et al.
(2000), Ram´ırez et al. (2000) and Cunha et al. (2007) were essentially all made using sim-
ilar methodology to one another, we do not consider these three studies as being mutually

independent.
of-the-art among these studies. The average of Cunha et al.’s result for IRS 7 and ours is
( ¯A(Fe) = 7.63 ± 0.05), which agrees well with the average Central cluster value they found.
Similarly, for VR 5-7 the average is ( ¯A(Fe) = 7.58 ± 0.04). With respect to the Solar values
of Asplund et al. (2005), this gives [Fe/H]IRS 7 = 0.18 ±0.07 and [Fe/H]V R 5−7 = 0.13 ±0.06.

From these measurements, it appears that there is evidence for slight Fe enhancement
within the massive evolved stars at the GC. The uncertainties we state above are the simple
root-mean-square of the abundances derived by Cunha et al. (2007) and ourselves. It is likely
that, at the uncertainty level of a few percent, we are dominated by systematic uncertainties
which in some way aﬄict both studies, such as departures from LTE in the stars’ atmo-
spheres. Thus, we conclude that the two stars studied have surface Fe abundances which are
30-50% above that of Solar, though at this level we are hitting the precision limits of stellar
abundance analyses.

However, when interpreting these results one must consider the evolved nature of the
objects studied. As it is likely that the atmospheres of the stars suﬀer from H depletion
due to core H burning and deep convective mixing, the initial Fe abundances of the stars
may well have been entirely consistent with the Solar level. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, in a
plot of Fe/H against stellar luminosity for the rotating Geneva stellar evolutionary models

– 12 –

presented in Hirschi et al. (2004). The plot shows how the Fe/H abundance ratio increases
as stars evolve oﬀ the main-sequence and the products of nuclear burning begin to become
apparent at the surface. On average, the surface Fe/H ratio is ∼0.1dex lower during the
RSG phase than on the main-sequence.

From comparison with our Fe measurements for the two GC RSGs, it appears that
while both stars currently show marginal evidence for Fe enhancement, their initial Fe/H
composition was likely much closer to Solar. Similarly, the previous studies of stars in the
GC by e.g. Najarro et al. (2008) and Cunha et al. (2007) are consistent with Solar initial Fe
abundances if one considers the evolved nature of the objects studied.

Finally, we note that a depletion in H due to stellar nucleosynthesis implies a correspond-
ing increase in He in the stellar envelope. This has no impact on our analysis method, as
the opacity in RSG atmospheres is fully dominated by H−, even if H is marginally depleted.

3.2. α-elements

In this study we have determined the abundances of several α-elements: Ca, Si, Mg,
O, Ti and C. The interpretation of the abundances of C and O is not as straight-forward as
with the other α elements, as they are altered by stellar nucleosynthesis. For this reason we
will discuss O separately at the end of this section, and C in Sect. 3.3. For the rest of this
study we deﬁne α ≡(Ca, Si, Mg, Ti).

Literature α-element studies of these two stars are lacking; the only previous study being
the derivation of Ca abundances by Cunha et al. (2007). From Table 2, we ﬁnd excellent
agreement with their Ca abundance for VR 5-7. For IRS 7, we ﬁnd discrepancies between
our two measurements of ∆A(Ca) = 0.4 ± 0.2. However, we note that Cunha et al. (2007)
ﬁnd an average A(Ca) for the Central cluster of ¯A(Ca) = 6.57 ± 0.14, consistent with our
measurement for IRS 7 (A(Ca)IRS 7 = 6.46 ± 0.16). If the Ca abundances in the Central
cluster are homogeneous, it may be that, in Cunha et al.’s sample, IRS 7 represents a random
statistical outlier at the 2σ level – entirely plausible in a sample size of 10. We consider our
A(Ca) measurements to be in good agreement with those of Cunha et al.

Najarro et al. (2008) studied the α-elements Si and Mg in the spectra of the two LBVs
in the Quintuplet cluster, ﬁnding marginal evidence for enhancement with respect to Solar,
but with large uncertainties of 0.2-0.25 dex. Given these uncertainties, our measurements of
Si and Mg in the spectrum of VR 5-7 are consistent with those determined by Najarro et al.
for stars in the same cluster.

– 13 –

Overall, on average we ﬁnd that the α-elements studied here are overabundant with
respect to Solar by ∼ 0.15dex. This excess is clearly within the uncertainties associated
with each measurement.
If, for the moment, we assume that each element represents an
independent measurement, we can combine the abundances for all four α-elements studied
here to determine the average α-abundance for each star. We ﬁnd average abundances for
each star of [α/H]IRS 7 = +0.18 ± 0.07; and [α/H]VR 5−7 = +0.15 ± 0.05, where the quoted
errors are the rms scatter of the individual α-element abundances. However, as was described
in the previous section, these abundance ratios may be tainted by ∼0.1dex of H self-depletion
due to the stars’ evolution. Thus, we consider the initial α/H abundances of the two stars
to be in excellent agreement with the Solar value.

The parameter of relevence to the study of the GC’s star-formation history is the ratio
α/Fe: as stated in the introduction, α-elements are enriched by CCSNe, while Fe is enriched
by Type-Ia SN. Hence, a short burst of massive star formation should produce an over-
abundance of α-elements with respect to Fe; while a long star-forming epoch over ∼>Gyr
eventually pulls the α/Fe ratio back down. From the average Fe/H and α/H for each star
in this study, we ﬁnd [α/Fe]IRS 7 = −0.04 ± 0.13; and [α/Fe]VR 5−7 = +0.01 ± 0.12. We ﬁnd
no evidence for α-enrichment with respect to iron in these stars.

For oxygen, comparisons of relative abundances between objects are hindered by con-
fusion over the Solar O abundance used as a reference point.
In the 1-D Solar model,
the O fraction was found to be A(O)⊙ = 8.83 ± 0.05, a value which stayed constant to
within the errors over several revisions (Anders & Grevesse 1989; Grevesse & Noels 1993;
Grevesse & Sauval 1998). However, in the 3-D Solar model, the O fraction has been revised
downwards to A(O)⊙ = 8.66 ± 0.05 (Asplund et al. 2005). For the rest of this discussion, we
use the Asplund et al. value.

For IRS 7, we ﬁnd O/H to be depleted by 0.55±0.14 dex with respect to Solar, in good
agreement with the study by Carr et al. (2000) of the same star. However, this is much lower
(∼0.9dex) than the average O abundance of the star’s host cluster: Cunha et al. (2007) found
the Central cluster to have an average super-Solar O/H ratio of 0.38±0.20 dex. Interestingly,
we ﬁnd the O abundance of VR 5-7 in the neighbouring Quintuplet cluster to be similar to
the average of Central cluster (A(O)VR 5−7 = +0.43 ± 0.12). The anomolous O abundance
of IRS 7 with respect to the rest of the GC RSGs could be explained as global super-Solar
O/H of RSGs in the GC, with severe O depletion at the surface of IRS 7 due its advanced
evolutionary state – this stars’ evolution is discussed in more detail in the next section. We
ﬁnd O abundances relative to Fe for the two objects of [O/Fe]IRS 7 = −0.69 ± 0.18; and
[O/Fe]VR 5−7 = +0.33 ± 0.16.

In summary, we ﬁnd that the α abundances in the GC are consistent with Solar, both

– 14 –

as a fraction of H and Fe. We suggest that there may be a slight enhancement of O with
respect to H, though we treat this result with caution due to the recent controversy over the
Solar O abundance.

3.3. Carbon

As with oxygen, the Solar carbon abundance has also been revised downwards in the
3-D Solar model, from A(C)⊙ = 8.57 ± 0.05 (Anders & Grevesse 1989; Grevesse & Noels
1993; Grevesse & Sauval 1998) to A(C)⊙ = 8.39 ± 0.05 (Asplund et al. 2005). We use the
Asplund et al. value in this discussion.

Regardless of the adopted value of A(C)⊙, we ﬁnd strong evidence for C depletion in
IRS 7. For this object we derive A(C)= 7.77 ± 0.07, in good agreement with the previous
study of by Carr et al. (2000). This represents a carbon abundance relative to Solar of
[C/H] = -0.62 ± 0.09. This is in contrast to VR 5-7, which is only marginally depleted in C
compared to the Solar value.

In Fig. 4 we plot A(C) for each star studied against their luminosities, which we take
from Cunha et al. (2007). To illustrate the level of C-depletion as a function of the stars’
evolution, we overplot the theoretical mass-tracks of Hirschi et al. (2004), calculated at Solar
metallicity and which incorporate initial rotational velocities of 300 km s−1. We note that
these tracks were created using the relative abundances of Anders & Grevesse (1989) and
Grevesse & Noels (1993), and therefore use the higher initial C fractions described above.
Thus, all other things being equal3, the tracks should be displaced by -0.18dex in A(C) if
the latest relative C abundance is used. This is indicated by the arrow in the plot panel.

From the ﬁgure, we see that VR 5-7 is in good agreement with the 15M ⊙ track, even
if the track is moved downwards to reﬂect the updated C fraction. However, the heavy
depletion of C in IRS 7 is not reproduced by the mass-tracks, even when the lower value for
A(C)⊙ is taken into account. The sharp downturn in A(C) of the 25M ⊙ track corresponds
to the removal of the H-rich envelope and the evolution of the star away from the RSG
stage towards a Wolf-Rayet phase. On the 25M ⊙ mass-track, the minimum A(C) reached
during the RSG phase is similar to the minimum A(C) of the 15M ⊙ and 20M ⊙ tracks, at
A(C)≈8.45.

3We make the assumption that changes of a few × 0.1dex in the relative abundances of C and O will not
aﬀect, for example, reaction rates or envelope opacties such that the evolutionary path of the star would be
signiﬁcantly altered from those plotted in Fig. 4, other than the linear displacement in abundance-space.

– 15 –

We explore the subject of the stars’ evolutionary state further in the right-hand panel
of Fig. 4, where we plot the carbon fraction against the oxygen fraction for the two stars.
The location in the panel synonymous with the RSG phase corresponds to the lower-left end
of the 15M ⊙ and 20M ⊙ tracks at [A(O), A(C)] ≈ (8.9, 8.4). If, as above, we again make
the assumption that the mass-tracks can simply be displaced to represent the updated Solar
abundances, the star VR 5-7 appears to be enhanced in O with respect to the evolutionary
tracks. IRS 7 on the other hand shows severe depletion in both C and O, much more than
is predicted by the evolutionary models for an RSG with Solar initial abundances. Indeed,
the position of IRS 7 in A(C)-A(O) space is more consistent with the A(C) minimum of
the 25M ⊙ track. In the model, this corresponds to a nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet (WN) phase,
where the products of CNO burning are more readily seen due to the removal of the outer
envelope by the stellar wind. Our results suggest that the envelope of IRS 7 has experienced
a greater level of pollution by CNO-processed material than is predicted by the standard set
of rotating evolutionary models. This may have been caused by particularly deep convection
zones in the star’s atmosphere, or by enhanced rotational mixing due to a high initial rotation
velocity. Alternatively, a high mass-loss phase could have peeled away the outer layers,
revealing more chemically-processed material, but without removing enough H to cause the
drop the envelope opacity required for the star to evolve back to the blue.

3.4. Summary and discussion: chemical abundances in the Galactic Centre

The results of our abundance analyses of two RSGs in the GC can be summarized as

follows:

• The observed Fe/H ratios of the two stars studied are marginally super-Solar, in agree-

ment with previous studies.

• For the α-elements Ca, Si, Mg and Ti together, we ﬁnd enhancement with respect to
H by 40-60%, albeit at the 2σ conﬁdence level. The α/Fe ratios are Solar to within
the errors (±25%), a result which is again consistent with previous studies.

• Weak evidence for O-enrichment is found in VR 5-7, while IRS 7 is heavily O-depleted

- most likely a result of its advanced evolutionary state.

• We ﬁnd signiﬁcant C depletion in the atmospheres of both stars. In the case of VR 5-
7, this is consistent with the predictions of a 15-20M ⊙ RSG in the rotating Geneva
evolutionary models. IRS 7 however has much greater C depletion. In combination
with this star’s low O abundance, this suggests that the products of severe CNO
processing are been seen at the star’s surface.

– 16 –

As summarized in Sect. 1, several previous studies of objects in the GC have argued for
super-Solar metal abundances in the GC (Carr et al. 2000; Ram´ırez et al. 2000; Cunha et al.
2007; Najarro et al. 2008). We emphasize here that, where available, we measure elemental
abundances X/H for Fe and several α-elements that are consistent with these studies. How-
ever, in the interpretation of their results these previous studies did not take into account the
self-depletion of H at the surfaces of the stars due to nuclear burning and internal mixing.
We have shown, with the aid of evolutionary models, that this level of self-depletion RSGs
may be as large as 0.1dex, and is comparable to the observed level metal enhancement with
respect to H. Hence, the super-Solar X/H ratios may simply be an artifact of H-depletion
rather than being due to enriched metal abundances, and the initial X/H abundance ra-
tios of the stars were consistent with Solar levels. When taking this eﬀect into account, we
interpret the results diﬀerently to previous works and conclude that the metallic elemental
abundances in the GC are Solar, at least to within the precision to which we are currently
able to measure them. In addition, we ﬁnd that the ratio α/Fe is also Solar to within the
errors.

Thus, with a Solar α/Fe ratio in the GC it is not necessary to invoke a peculiar star-
forming history, such as a signiﬁcantly ﬂattened IMF. Nor do we need to reconcile a super-
Solar α/Fe ratio with star-formation which has been continuous for the last ∼Gyr (see Sect.
1, and Figer et al. 2004). We again emphasize that our results of Solar α/Fe and Solar Fe/H
to within the uncertainties are in agreement with previous studies when H-depletion due to
nuclear processing is taken into account.

So, how do these abundance patterns ﬁt in with the rest of the Galaxy? A Solar Fe
abundance in the GC is certainly inconsistent with a simple extrapolation of the disk’s Fe
gradient to lower Galacto-centric distances. Luck et al. (2006) summarize the recent results
of their group and show a clear trend of increasing Fe/H towards the GC from a large sample
of Cepheids. They derive a gradient of -0.068dex kpc−1, which when extrapolated all the way
to the GC implies [Fe/H] ≈ +0.6. Our results, as well as those of other recent studies, show
that the Fe/H ratio in the GC is more consistent with that of the inner disk, at RGC ∼ 5kpc
(see below).

As noted by Cunha et al. (2007), reconciliation between the disk Fe/H and that of the
GC require that the Fe/H gradient become signiﬁcantly ﬂattened inside RGC ∼ 5kpc. How-
ever, there is no reason to assume that this abundance gradient can simply be extrapolated all
the way to the GC. Shortward of RGC ∼ 5kpc there is a distinct lack of recent star-forming ac-
tivity: there is a dearth of giant HII regions and massive stars between 0.1kpc∼< RGC ∼< 5kpc.
Presumably this is related to the presence of the Galactic Bar, which extends to RGC ∼ 4kpc
(Benjamin et al. 2005). This obvious and sharp transition in star-formation history makes

– 17 –

it unlikely that the abundance gradients in the outer Galaxy are valid within RGC ∼ 4kpc.

We are left with the problem of explaining the abundance patterns in the GC, with
respect to those in the rest of the Galaxy. In external barred-spiral galaxies, it is commonly
accepted that the eﬀect of the bar is to transport gas from the inner disk to the galaxy’s
centre – see for example the observational studies of M100 (Allard et al. 2006) and NGC1365
(Z´anmar S´anchez et al. 2008), as well as numerical work (e.g. Athanassoula 1992). Material
infalling onto the galactic centre becomes shocked, and a nuclear starburst is triggered.
This starburst can continue for as long as the centre is supplied with material. For an
extensive review of the secular evolution of barred spiral galaxies, the reader is directed to
Kormendy & Kennicutt (2004).

If the star-formation in the centre of our own Galaxy is being fuelled by matter trans-
ported down the Bar, one would expect to ﬁnd similar abundance patterns at the GC as at
the edges of the Bar. That is, the abundances we ﬁnd in the thin disk at Galacto-centric
distances of RGC ∼ 4kpc. Abundance studies at these radii are few. The cepheid data from
Luck et al. (2006) becomes scarce at RGC ∼< 6kpc with only one data-point at RGC < 5kpc.
From their inner-most data they ﬁnd [Fe/H]∼0.2-0.3dex and [Ca/Fe]∼0.0. Smartt et al.
(2001), Daﬂon & Cunha (2004) and Munn et al. (2004) have observed a total of 6 OB stars
within RGC < 5kpc, ﬁnding weak evidence for a super-Solar O/H ratio, but with a large
spread. Analysis of the Scutum Red Supergiant clusters, located at RGC ≈ 3.5 − 4 kpc,
has revealed abundances which are ≈0.2dex below Solar (Davies et al., in prep). In their
discussion of this result in the context of other abundance measurements in the GC, Davies
et al. suggest that the abundances at RGC from 3 to 5 kpc are approximately Solar, with
Solar α/Fe, but with a spread of ±0.25dex. The abundance gradient between the inner disk
and our location in the Galaxy must then be very shallow, as is typical for galaxies with
strong bars (Zaritsky et al. 1994). Andrievsky et al. (2002) suggested that the gradient is
extremely ﬂat in the Solar neighbourhood (≈-0.02dex kpc−1), and steepens at RGC ∼< 6kpc.
However, we will show in a forthcoming paper (Davies et al., in prep) that this steepening
may be an artifact of their spatial sampling, that large azimuthal variations may be present
within RGC ∼< 6kpc, and that this behaviour is seen in the inner disks of other barred spirals.
The abundances found at RGC ∼ 4kpc are then similar with those we ﬁnd at the GC;
namely Fe/H, α/Fe and O/Fe which are all approximately Solar to within the uncertainties
of ±20-30%. Hence, from a chemistry point-of-view it is entirely plausible that the star-
formation in the GC is fuelled by material channelled from the inner-disk by the Bar, in a
manner similar to that seen in external barred spirals. Further, the rate at which material
ﬂows down the Bar seems to be consistent with the global star-formation rate in the GC.
Morris & Serabyn (1996) use order-of-magnitude dynamical arguments to estimate the rate

– 18 –

of material ﬂowing from the Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) to be ˙MILR ∼ 0.1 − 1M ⊙yr−1;
while G¨usten (1989) estimate the GC star-formation rate to be 0.3-0.6M ⊙yr−1from the
inferred number of Lyman photons. Hence, the rate of inﬂowing material appear to be
suﬃcient to power the GC star-formation, even when one takes into account the outward-
ﬂowing Galactic wind ( ˙MGW ∼< 0.1M ⊙yr−1 Morris & Serabyn 1996).

Clearly, there are large uncertainties on these numbers, and we cannot discard the
contribution of the winds from Bulge stars. Abundance studies of these objects have found
similar average values of [Fe/H] and [O/Fe], albeit with a large spread in [Fe/H] of ±0.4dex
(Rich & Origlia 2005; Cunha & Smith 2006; Lecureur et al. 2007; Fulbright et al. 2007). The
total mass-loss rate from these objects with RGC ∼ 2kpc has been estimated to be ∼0.1M
⊙yr−1, though it is unknown how much of this material ﬁnds its way to the GC. If one wishes
to add a further layer of complexity to the problem, it is possible that metal-rich gas from
recent generations of massive stars mixes with metal-poor gas from the bulge stars’ winds to
contrive current abundance levels which appear approximately Solar (see also van Loon et al.
2003).

In summary, from our abundance analysis of two RSGs in the GC, combined with the
results of other studies, we ﬁnd that both the Fe abundance and the α/Fe ratio are consistent
with Solar values, and those of the inner Galactic disk at RGC ∼ 4 − 5kpc. When combined
with mass-budget arguments, these results suggest that the recent star-formation in the GC
was fuelled by material channelled along the Galactic Bar from the inner disk, though we
cannot rule out a contribution from the winds of Bulge giants. Thus, there is no need to
invoke of a top-heavy IMF to produce the relative chemical abundances. However, if a top-
heavy IMF does exist in the GC, abundance levels in the GC may be held at Solar by a
contribution of metal-poor gas from the winds of bulge giants.

Fig. 2.—: The observed spectrum of VR 5-7 (histogram) overplotted with the best-ﬁt model (solid-
line) and test models, which vary the stellar parameters and abundances, illustrating the robustness
of the best-ﬁt solution. Bottom-left panel: varying abundances only; bottom right panel: eﬀective
temperature varied and abundances adjusted accordingly; top-left panel: microturbulence varied
with abundances adjusted; top-right panel: gravity varied and abundances adjusted.

Fig. 3.—: Surface hydrogen depletion of massive stars as a function of their evolution, illustrat-
ing that the measured Fe/H abundance for evolved stars can be larger than that of their initial
metallicity. The overplotted mass-tracks are from Hirschi et al. (2004).

Fig. 4.—: Left: The surface carbon abundances of the two stars in this study, in comparison to
the evolutionary models of Meynet & Maeder (2000). We plot the mass tracks for the three initial
masses shown, using the Solar metallicity models with initial rotational velocities of 300 km s−1.
The arrow denotes the magnitude of the change in the updated Solar carbon abundance with respect
to those used by Meynet & Maeder in constructing the mass-tracks. Right: Surface C abundances
versus surface O abundances. The overplotted mass-tracks are from the same evolutionary models
as the left-hand panel. The arrow again denotes the change in the measured Solar composition
with the updated Solar model.
