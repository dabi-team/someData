On the Relationship between Treatment Eﬀect Heterogeneity and
the Variability Ratio Eﬀect Size Statistic

Alexander Volkmann∗

1 Abstract

Recently, the variability ratio (VR) eﬀect size statis-
tic has been used with increasing frequency in the
study of diﬀerences in variation of a measured vari-
able between two study populations. More speciﬁcally,
the VR eﬀect size statistic allows for the detection
of treatment eﬀect heterogeneity (TEH) of medical
interventions. While a VR that is diﬀerent from 1 is
widely acknowledged to implicate a treatment eﬀect
heterogeneity (TEH) the exact relationship between
those two quantities has not been discussed in detail
thus far.

In this note we derive a precise connection between
TEH and VR. In particular, we derive precise upper
and lower bounds on the TEH in terms of VR. More-
over, we provide an exemplary simulation for which
VR is equal to 1 and there exist TEH.

Our result has implications for the interpretation of
VR eﬀect size estimates regarding its connection to
treatment eﬀect heterogeneity of (medical) interven-
tions.

Introduction

response in schizophrenia. Plöderl and Hengartner
(2019), Maslej et al.
(2020) and Volkmann, Volk-
mann, and Mueller (2020) investigated the variability
of antidepressants’ response in depression.

Other recent works that have used the VR eﬀect
size statistic in order to compare the variability be-
tween two groups include Brugger and Howes (2017),
Pillinger et al. (2019), Rogdaki et al. (2020) as well
as Brugger et al. (2020).

While a VR that is diﬀerent from 1 is widely acknowl-
edged to implicate a variation in treatment eﬀect the
exact relationship between those two quantities has
not discussed in detail thus far.

The purpose of this note is to derive a precise con-
nection between the TEH and the VR. Moreover, we
provide an exemplary simulation for which VR is equal
to 1, yet there exist substantial TEH.

3 Methods – Individual treat-

ment eﬀect

The treatment eﬀect of individual i with respect to a
given (medical) treatment is deﬁned as (cf. e.g. Mor-
gan and Winship (2015)),

δi = Y 1

i − Y 0
i ,

Recently, the variability ratio (VR) eﬀect size statistic
(deﬁned in Hedges and Nowell (1995), and proposed
in Nakagawa et al. (2015)) has been used in various
meta-analyses to investigate the diﬀerence of the total
amount of variance present between two experimental
groups.

Senior et al. (2016) compared the eﬀects of two dietary
interventions on variability in weight. Winkelbeiner et
al. (2019), McCutcheon et al. (2019) and Mizuno et
al. (2020) studied the variability of antipsychotic drug

where Y a
denotes the potential outcome of individual
i
i with respect to treatment a ∈ {0, 1}. The potential
outcome Y a
represents the outcome that the individ-
i
ual i would have had, had the individual i received
the treatment a, irrespective of the factual treatment,
the treatment that actually was received by the indi-
vidual. The fundamental problem of causal inference
(see Holland (1986)), states that we can never observe
both Y 1
at the same time. Moreover, the no-
i
tation reﬂects the fact that we make the Stable Unit
Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) assumption,
which allows us to write the potential outcomes for
an individual i as a function of the individual’s own

treatment assignment alone, rather than the treat-
ment assignment of all individuals in the population.
Mathematically, Y a1,...,ai,...
. This assumption
is not always valid. In case the treatment refers to
a vaccination against a disease the assumptions is
violated, since the eﬀect of a potential vaccination of
an individual i depends on whether others have been
vaccinated.

In the following we consider the so-called super-
population perspective, in which we view our sample
of size N as a random sample from an inﬁ-
Y 0
i , Y 1
i
nite population. More formally, we consider Y a
to
i
be realizations of a population level random variable
Y a. Similarly, δi are realizations of a population level
random variable δ.

i , Y 1
i

In summary, there are two levels of randomness that
we consider. Firstly, we randomly draw individuals
i = 1, ..., N from an inﬁnite population, each indi-
vidual having an associated pair (Y 0
) of poten-
tial outcomes. Secondly, a predetermined number
(0 < N1 < N ) of individuals get randomly assigned
to treatment (a = 1), the remaining (N0 = N − N1)
individuals get assigned to the control (a = 0) group,
and the associated outcomes Yi = Y a
are observed.
i
The uncertainty in any type of estimate that results
from these two levels of randomness may be referred
to as sampling-based and design-based uncertainty,
respectively (see Abadie et al. (2020)).

Notably, there is an additional layer of randomness
that might be considered. We could assume that for
each individual i, Y a
are random variables rather than
i
mere realizations of a population level random variable
Y a. In this case one might refer to δi as the random
treatment eﬀect of the individual i. Realizations ya
i
of Y a
could be viewed as draws from a “metaphorical
i
population, comprising the possible eventualities that
might have occurred but mainly didn’t” (see Spiegel-
halter (2019)). Alternatively, the source for this part
of the randomness could be a model for measurement
error, epistemological uncertainty, or could reﬂect the
assumption that the individual i has a truly random
outcome.

3.1 Treatment eﬀect heterogeneity

Treatment eﬀect heterogeneity (TEH) is present if
not all individuals have the same individual treatment
eﬀect, i.e. δi is not the same for all individuals. In
the language of the super-population perspective this
means that V ar(δ) > 0. Of course, in any practical
situation it is impossible not to have TEH. The more
interesting question to study is the question about

the degree or the magnitude of TEH. It can be quan-
tiﬁed by estimating the magnitude of V ar(δ) or by
identifying a relevant (w.r.t. the application at hand)
subgroup X of the population for which E[δ|X] − E[δ]
is large.

In the case of random individual treatment eﬀect, we
need to distinguish between inter- and intra-individual
TEH. The inter-individual TEH could be deﬁned as
the variation between individuals of the average ran-
dom individual treatment eﬀect (E[δi]).

3.2 Variability Ratio

We deﬁne the variability ratio ν (cf. Hedges and Nowell
(1995)) as

ν = σ1
σ0

,

where σ2
a
population variances.

In the case of suﬃciently large sample sizes N0, N1,
suﬃciently large values σa and (approximately) nor-
mally distributed ln σa, an unbiased estimator of ln ν
and its sample variance (cf. Raudenbush and Bryk
(1987); Nakagawa et al. (2015)) are given by

4 Results – Treatment eﬀect
heterogeneity and variability
ratio

In order to derive the main analytical relationship
between TEH and the VR eﬀect size statistic we
consider two time points t = 0 (baseline) and t = 1
(endpoint). We denote by Y a
the potential outcomes
it
of individual i at time t with respect to the treatment
, i.e. there is no eﬀect at
a. We assume that Y 0
i0 ≡ Y 1
i0
baseline. Then, we may write

In words, this means that we can decompose the
potential outcome score Y a
of individual i at endpoint
i1
(t = 1) under treatment a as the sum of the following
quantities (Figure 1):

that

• the baseline score (aka the pre-treatment score)

of individual i

• the temporal change of score (aka the response)

of individual i under control

• the treatment eﬀect of individual i in case a = 1

and zero otherwise.

We then have for the diﬀerence in variance in temporal

Here, ρ denotes the correlation between τ , the change

it contains information about the correlation between

Now set r := ν2 − 1, then we see that we must have
that r ≥ −ρ2, and we may write
p

|σδ + ρ στ | = στ

r + ρ2.

Hence, we have the following compatible values for σδ
(

σδ = στ (pr + ρ2 − ρ);
σδ = στ (±pr + ρ2 − ρ); ρ ≤ 0 and − ρ2 ≤ r ≤ 0.

r ≥ 0

Hatched area has two solutions for σδ.

It is interesting to observe that for negative values
of r (or equivalently, ν < 1) there are two possible
solutions for σδ as visualized in ﬁgures (3) and (4).
Since the quantities r = ν2 − 1 and στ are estimable
from data, the main equation (2) implies the following
bound on σδ:

|1 − ν| ≤

≤ 1 + ν.

4.1 Compatible values of TEH and

VR

If we are willing to make assumptions on the values of
ρ, e.g. through domain knowledge, this estimate can
be improved. In case ρ = 0 we have that

With equation (1) at hand, we are ready to derive
restrictions on the standard deviation σδ = V ar(δ) 1
of the treatment eﬀect δ.

Let ν be the variability ratio deﬁned with respect to

From a Bayesian perspective, we may put a distribu-
tion on the values of ρ representing our belief about
the true value of ρ, which in turn yields a probability
distribution on the values of σδ.

4.2 Simulations

In this section we conduct a simulation that illustrates
the compatibility of a variability ratio of 1 and an
average treatment eﬀect of 0 with a TEH of σδ = 1.
We consider the following toy example. Let Y 0, Y 1
be the potential outcome responses under control and
treatment, respectively. We let (Y 0, Y 1 − Y 0) have
a distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix Σ
given by

Σ =

The following python code generates potential out-
comes of this toy model for 10000 units:
import numpy as np
from numpy.random import choice

np.random.seed(1)

rho = -0.5
mu_tau = 0
sigma_tau = 1
mu_delta = 0
sigma_delta = 1

N = 10000

def draw_potential_outcomes(N):

Sigma = np.array(

u = np.random.multivariate_normal(

(mu_tau, mu_delta), Sigma, size=N

)
Y0 = u[:, 0]
Y1 = Y0 + u[:, 1]
return Y0, Y1

The python code below conducts 1000 simulations of
drawing 10000 units from the toy model distribution,
calculating the empirical standard deviation of the
(unobservable) treatment eﬀect, randomly assigning
them into treatment and control groups, and then
calculating the VR eﬀect size statistic.

N1 = int(N / 2)
W[choice(range(N), N1, replace=False)] = True

Y1_obs = Y1[W]
Y0_obs = Y0[~W]

SD_treatment = Y1_obs.std(ddof=1)
SD_control = Y0_obs.std(ddof=1)
VR = SD_treatment / SD_control

SD_delta = (Y1 - Y0).std()

df = df.append(

},

)

The python code above was used to generate the
following visualization of the simulations:

5 Discussion and Conclusions

The variability ratio (VR) eﬀect size statistic (deﬁned
in Hedges and Nowell (1995); and proposed in Nak-
agawa et al. (2015)) has been used extensively in
order to study treatment eﬀect heterogeneity (TEH)
in clinical studies. While a VR that is diﬀerent from 1
is widely acknowledged to implicate a treatment eﬀect
heterogeneity (TEH) the exact relationship between
those two quantities has not been discussed in detail
thus far.

In this note we derived an analytic expression that
connects the VR and the standard deviation of the
treatment eﬀect that includes an unobservable corre-
lation coeﬃcient. This equation implies precise upper
and lower bounds on the the standard deviation of the
treatment eﬀect in terms of the VR and the standard
deviation of the response under placebo.

In particular, we showed that in case that the vari-
ability is equal to 1, the standard deviation of the
treatment eﬀect is at most twice the size of the stan-
dard deviation of the response under placebo. More-
over, if one is willing to make assumptions on the
non-negativity of an unobserved quantity this implies
a constant treatment eﬀect. We illustrated our ﬁnding
with visualizations and a simulation.
