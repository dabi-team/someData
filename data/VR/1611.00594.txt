We  present  a  technique,  based  on  atoms  coupled  to  an  optical  cavity,  for  non-destructive  detection  of  trapped 
ions. We demonstrate the vacuum-Rabi splitting (VRS), arising due to the collective strong coupling of ultracold Rb  
atoms to a cavity, to change in presence of trapped  Rb+ ions. The Rb+ ions are optically dark and the  Rb atoms are 
prepared in a dark magneto-optical trap (MOT). The VRS is measured on an optically open transition of the initially 
dark Rb atoms. The measurement itself  is fast, non-destructive and has sufficient fidelity to permit the measurement 
of  atomic-state  selective  ion-atom  collision  rate.  This  demonstration  illustrates  a  method  based  on  atom-cavity 
coupling to measure two particle interactions generically and non-destructively.

In  this  article  we  demonstrate  in-situ  detection  of  the 
ion-atom  (i.e.  matter-matter)  interaction  based  on  cavity 
mediated  light-atom  (i.e.  light-matter)  interaction.  The 
coupling of atoms to cavities creates a versatile system for 
precision  studies  of  light-matter  interactions [1–3].  The 
system  comprises  two  high  Q  oscillators,  one  of  which  is 
the  atom  and  the  other  is  a  precisely  tailored  mode  of  an 
electromagnetic field, whose mutual interaction results in a 
host  of 
fundamental  phenomena [3–5,7].  Here  we 
experimentally  take  this  coupled  system  to  a  new  regime 
with the addition of trapped ions in the cavity mode. In this 
proof of principle experiment, we demonstrate the vacuum-
Rabi  splitting  (VRS),  arising  due  to  the  collective  strong 
coupling of  the atoms to  the cavity,  to change in presence 
of  trapped  ions.  The  loss  of  ultracold  atoms  from  a  dark 
magneto-optical  trap  (MOT),  due  to  ion-atom  interaction, 

leads  to  a  change  in  the  atom-cavity  coupling  thereby

allowing  non-destructive  detection  of

Specifically,  we  use  the  change  in  collective  strong 
coupling [1,4,21–25] of 85Rb atoms to a mode of an optical 
cavity  to  measure  the  interaction  between  ultracold  85Rb 
atoms  in  an  optically  dark  5s  2S1/2  (F  =  2)  state  and  non-
fluorescing  85Rb+  ions  that  cannot  be  detected  optically. 
With the cavity tuned to the non-cycling 5s 2S1/2 (F = 2) → 
5p  2P3/2  (F'  =  3)  transition  frequency  (      )  of  atomic 
85Rb, we  measure the  VRS in  two cases: with  85Rb atoms 
alone or with both  85Rb+ ions and  85Rb atoms overlapping 
the cavity mode. The VRS is different in the two cases and 
provides a rapid, non-destructive and atomic-state selective 
measurement  of  the  ion-atom  collisions,  which  is  used  to 
determine  the  ion  density  and  number  of  ions  overlapped 
with the MOT.  

II.  THE CONCEPT 

The  ion-atom  interaction  is  facilitated  in  a  hybrid 
trap [26,27], in which the ion and atom  traps are precisely 
co-centred and aligned for optimal overlap with the cavity 
mode.  A  schematic  of  the  experimental  arrangement  is 
shown in Fig. 1(a). The experimental concept is illustrated 
in  Figs.  1(b)-1(d),  where  we  show  that  the  atom-cavity 
coupling results in a systematic change in the transmission 
of an on-axis weak probe beam depending on the presence 
and absence of atoms and ions. For our cavity parameters, a 
single atom cannot couple strongly to the cavity mode, i.e. 
the  single  atom  cavity  coupling  constant               , 
where    is  the  free  space  spontaneous  decay  rate  of  the 
excited atomic state and   is the cavity mode light loss rate

atoms,  the  presence  of  the  trapped  ions  alters  the  atom 
numbers in the cavity mode volume, resulting in a reduced 
VRS          
  , as seen in Fig. 1(d). We use 
this change in VRS to determine the ion-atom collision rate 
and the density of trapped ions. 

       √  

technique 

We note that the ion-atom collision rate can be obtained 
by measuring the changes in fluorescence [28,29] of atoms 
if a bright MOT is used instead of a dark MOT. However, 
the  present  VRS 
is  more  general  and 
advantageous  because  (a) 
it  measures  a  frequency 
difference  rather  than  a  power/intensity  change,  (b)  the 
measured value of collision rate in the dark MOT is atomic 
quantum state specific (shown here for F = 2 state of 85Rb) 
rather than for a mixture of quantum states (e.g. mixture of 
F = 2 and F' = 3 state if a 85Rb bright MOT is used) and (c) 
the  measurement is performed  continuously as opposed to 
all  previous  VRS work  that required turning off the  MOT 
 [25]),  thus  rendering  continuous  measurements 
(e.g. 
be 
intractable.  Further, 
straightforwardly  extended  to  atoms  trapped  in  a  far-off-
resonance dipole trap and collectively coupled to the cavity 
– this can allow better state preparation, state manipulation 
and would get rid of near resonant light – all of which can 
make  the  method  more  sensitive.  In  addition,  since 
measuring  VRS  does  not  destroy  the  atomic  cloud  (like 
absorption  imaging  would),  it  lends  itself  to  repeated 
measurements on the same atomic sample.

III.  EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 

As  shown  schematically  in  Fig.  1(a),  ultracold  85Rb 

atoms in the ground state 

 are trapped in 

a dark MOT at a typical temperature of ~ 100-150 μK and 
overlapped with the mode centre of a Fabry-Perot cavity of 
finesse  ~  650.  A  modified  spherical  Paul  trap [26,27], 
concentric with the MOT and cavity center, is used to trap 
85Rb+ ions at a typical temperature of ~ 700 K. The details 
of the dark MOT, the cavity and the ion trap are described 
in Appendix A, B and C, respectively. The empty cavity is 

tuned  to  the 

 transition  and  the 

frequency   of the probe beam is scanned across the same 
transition while the transmitted power PT is monitored on a 
photomultiplier  tube  (PMT).  When  ultracold  atoms  are 
present  in  the  cavity  mode  vacuum-Rabi  peaks  separated 
by    (=  60.4  ±  1.4  MHz)  are  seen  (Fig.  2(a)).  The  VRS 
decreases  to         in  presence  of  the  blue  (473  nm)  laser 
beam that is used to create 85Rb+ ions by photo-ionization

experiment.  Ultracold  85Rb  atoms  in  5s  2S1/2,  F  =  2  state  are 
trapped  in  a  dark  MOT  and  85Rb+  ions  are  trapped  in  a  spherical 
Paul trap such that their centres overlap. The ion-atom mixture is 
placed at the centre of an optical cavity and the system is probed 
with  a  weak  on-axis  probe  beam  by  scanning  its  frequency    
across  the  F  =  2  →  F'  =  3  transition  and  monitoring  the 
transmitted  light  using  a  PMT.  (b)  In  the  absence  of  atoms  a 
single  transmission  peak  is  seen.  (c)  In  presence  of  atoms,  the 
regime of collective strong coupling between atoms and cavity is 
attained,  the  transmission  at          drops  to  zero  and  two 
vacuum-Rabi  peaks,  separated  in  frequency  by           √   ,

of atoms that occupy  the cavity  mode volume is increased 
to   , each  atom  can potentially couple to a single photon 
in  the  cavity  mode   [1,22,23].  Since  any  (but  only  one) 
atom  at  a  time  can  couple  to  the  photon  (which  is 
indivisible), there are    couplings possible at each instant, 
which is equivalent to reducing the mode volume per atom 
to        .  Substituting  this  in  the  expression  for  single 
atom-photon coupling gives the cavity coupling of a single

When photo-ionization and trapped ions are absent, all

IV.  ION-ATOM COLLISION RATE 

The velocity of ions in the ion trap (hundreds of m/s) is 
much  higher than  the velocity of  neutral atoms (which are 
essentially at rest). Since the depth of the ion trap (0.32 eV) 
is  much  higher  than  the  typical  depth  (<1  meV)  of  the 
MOT,  even  a  glancing  elastic  collision  between  a  neutral 
Rb  atom  and  a  Rb+  ion  is  always  expected  to  lead  to  the

non-destructive  measure for the local ion density 

 in the 

MOT region. Such a local density measurement is difficult 
to  perform  for  optically  dark  ions  such  as  85Rb+.  For 
example,  the other detection method  [17,20] for such ions 
requires the extraction of all the ions in the ion trap onto a 
charge  sensitive  detector  (such  as  a  channel  electron 
multiplier),  hence  losing  the  ions  in  the  process.  Yet 
another  detection  method  [12] requires a coulomb crystal 
of  laser  cooled  ions  in  order  to  sympathetically  cool  the 
dark ions.

an 

specific 

atomic-state 

We  demonstrate 

and 
continuous  method, based on collective strong coupling of 
atoms to a cavity, for detection of ion-atom interaction and 
noninvasive  measurement  of  density  of  trapped  ions.  An 
important  benefit  of  using  to     atoms,  as  opposed  to  a 
single  atom,  is  that  the  measurements  can  be  done  much 
faster owing to the strong coupling being achieved even for 
a low finesse (i.e. high κ) cavity. The rate at which a VRS 
measurement can be  made is fundamentally limited by  the 
rate  κ  at  which  photons  can  be  extracted  from  the  cavity 
and  a  reliable  measurement  requires  at  least       (     ) 
seconds. In case of a single atom, strong coupling requires 
           ,  which  in  typical  experiments  sets  the  lower 
limit for   to be ~ 100 µs – add to this the low duty cycle of 
single atom experiments. On the contrary, our experiment 
with    atoms is run continuously and  for a finesse ~ 650 
and  cavity  length  4.5  cm,   can  be  as low  as  100  ns.  The 
method can also be extended to detect the presence of other 
atoms,  ions  and  perhaps  molecules.  Another  interesting 
direction  to  pursue  is  the  detection  of  atom-molecule 
conversion  processes 
at  ultracold 
temperatures. We believe that the technique can be used as 
a  generic  method  for  in-situ,  non-destructive  and  rapid 
measurement of interactions.

APPENDIX A:  DARK MAGNETO-OPTICAL TRAP 

The dark  MOT  for  85Rb is loaded from a Rb dispenser 
source. Six independent beams detuned by  -12 MHz from 

 transition,  each  1  cm  in  diameter  and 
the 
with 7  mW power, form  the cooling beams for  the  MOT. 
Two  independent  beams  detuned  by  +20  MHz  from  the 

 transition, each 1 cm in diameter and with 
2.4  mW power, form  the repumping beams  for  the  MOT. 
The repumping beams have their centers darkened with an 
opaque disc of 2 mm diameter such that no repumping light 
is  present  in  the  MOT  region  –  this  pumps  >95%  of  the 
ultracold  85Rb  atoms  to  the  ground  non-fluorescing
state. The low fluorescence of the  trapped atoms in a dark 
MOT  minimizes  the  otherwise  deleterious  effects  of 

fluorescent  photons  being  coupled  to  the  optical  cavity. 
Apart  from  the  VRS  measurements,  we  independently

The  85Rb+  ions  are  created  continuously  by  ionizing, 
with a 473 nm laser beam, a fraction of the residual excited 
5p3/2  state  atoms  present  in  the  dark  MOT.  The  ions  are 
trapped in the  modified spherical Paul trap [26] consisting 
of four wires (Fig. 1(a)) - a sinusoidal voltage of amplitude 
Vrf = 85  V and  frequency 500  kHz is applied to the inner 
pair  of  wires  (separated  by  3  mm)  while  both  the  outer 
wires  (separated  by  6  mm)  are  at  -5  V.  The  secular 
frequencies in the radial and axial directions are measured 

to  be 

 =  43  kHz  and 

 =  54  kHz,  respectively.  The 

maximum  displacement 

 in  the  axial  direction  is  ~  2.5 

mm  from  which  the  upper  bound  of  the  trap  depth

estimated 

to  be  ~  0.32  eV  using 

the  expression
