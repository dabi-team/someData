1.  INTRODUCTION 
Currently  augmented  reality  (AR)  and  virtual  reality  (VR) 
usage in consumer-oriented technologies (Bonetti, Warnaby, & 
Quinn,  2018)  and  training  processes  (Andersen,  Mikkelsen, 
Konge, Cayé-Thomasen, & Sørensen, 2016) is increasing due 
to  their  usefulness  for  learning  processes  based  on  visual 
information empowered by its communication and information 
presentation capabilities (Seeber et al., 2018).  

Immersive  virtual  environments  enable  the  manipulation  of 
visual  information  in  different  situations  through  the  use  of 
entities  such  as  avatars,  virtual  humans  (Diemer,  Alpers, 
Peperkorn,  Shiban,  &  Mühlberger,  2015)  products  for 
commercialization (Hilken et al., 2018) and services such as the  

training  (Venturini  et  al.,  2016)  and  cognitive  processing 
(Cognifit, 2019) referring to a number of tasks the brain does 
continuously. 

Among the new challenges in the development of multimodal 
presentations  based  on  visual  and  audible  stimuli,  the 
integration  of  online  experiences  and  their  adaptation  to 
personal 
omnichannel 
have 
augmented  reality  experiences  (Hilken  et  al.,  2018)  which 
merge digital content as images and animations in a physical 
environment where the user interacts in real time.

3.  REVIEW OF LITERATURE AND 
RESEARCH AGENDAS 
Within the paradigm that establishes the potential of the virtual 
reality for revolutionizing education (Andersen et al., 2016) the 
current research agendas signal the lack of practical elements 
that  solve  the  use  of  simulation  in  education  (Jensen  & 
Konradsen, 2018) as an effective method in learning.  

However, for Seeber et al., (2018) adding information through 
audible and visual elements to the physical world through the 
production  of  an  immersive  environment  can  influence  the 
capabilities  of  collaborative  groups,  virtual  meetings  and 
interaction spaces through communication and presentation of 
information. 

Recent literature establishes that the biological system needs to 
make  inferences  about  the  environment  in  order  to  plan  and 
achieve goals successfully, to make these inferences Młynarski 
&  Hermundstad, (2018)  propose  that  the  nervous system  can 
build an internal model that links incoming sensory stimuli to 
the behavioral properties.

Though,  there  are  certain  patterns  of  deficiency  in  visual 
function  that  the  literature  identifies  as  depth  perception, 
peripheral vision, visual search, speed of visual processing and 
color  perception  (Navarra  &  Waterhouse,  2019)  which  are 
accompanied by a process in reduction of sensation to cognition 
linked in the frontal areas. 

Similarly, recent studies have shown that the development of 
preparatory  attentional  processes  presumes  success 
in 
prospective tasks (Grandi & Tirapu-Ustárroz, 2017) since one 
of  the  qualities  of  attention  is  to  help  the  extraction  of  the 
characteristics  of  a  stimulus,  increasing  the  brain  activity 
involved  in  the  processing  thereof  (Rothlein,  DeGutis,  & 
Esterman, 2016). 

4.  THEORETICAL BIAS 
4.1  Information Processing Theory  
The theory of information processing allows the incorporation 
of learning through stimuli with the use of attention, perception 
and  storage 
information 
(Moos,  2015)  by  means  of 
management. This allows the functioning of memory through 
the gradual increase of the information processing capacities in 
the development of skills for obtaining knowledge. 

Consequently,  the  user  executes  cognitive  coding  processes 
that  involve  the  processing  of  information  in  the  memory 
(Andrews Acquah, 2017), so that it can be recovered later by 
acquiring information stored in it. This theory establishes that 
there are limits on the amount of information that is processed 
in each stage; this information processing being interactive and 
multitasking (Jack Snowman & Biehler, 2014). 

4.2  Kolb’s Learning Model 
Not all people learn in the same way, therefore, it is important 
to  use  different  learning  styles,  according  to  Hoffmann, 
Agustín  Freiberg;  Liporace,  (2015)  the  styles  are  a  series  of 
cognitive, affective and physiological qualities, which allow us 
to know the way in which people perceive, respond and interact 
in different learning situations. 

the  perception  and  processing  of 
David  Kolb  defines 
information  as  dimensions  of  learning  (Rodríguez  Cepeda, 
2018),  these  highlight  a  certain  level  of  importance  in 
andragogic  education,  where  this  theorist  states  that  the 
preference for abstract learning increases with age, decreasing 
this  forms  activity  and  pragmatism  (Hoffmann,  Agustín 
Freiberg; Liporace, 2015). 

According  to  Romero  Agudelo,  Salinas  Urbina,  &  Mortera 
Gutiérrez, (2010), this learning model incorporates four basic 
capacities:  concrete  experience  (CE),  reflexive  observation 
(OR), 
active 
experimentation  (EA).  Kolb  states  that  experience  has  a 
relevance  in  the  learning  process  (Rodríguez  Cepeda,  2018) 
conditioning the life experience.

5.  NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF 
LEARNING AND INFORMATION 
MANAGEMENT 
5.1  Sensory Function 
Several functions have been attributed to the oscillatory activity 
in  the  brain,  including  the  processing,  propagation  and 
synchronization of information (Kissinger et al., 2018). They 
correlate  with  cognitive  load  as  attention,  in  the  same  way 
Einstein,  Polack,  Tran,  &  Golshani,  (2017)  state  that  low 
frequency  oscillations  are  important  within  the  processes  of 
perception of visual stimuli. 

The  low-level  visual  properties  have  certain  characteristics 
such as tone, spatial frequency and orientation (Ester, Sprague, 
& Serences, 2017), however, there are certain patterns of visual 
function  deficiency  that  the  literature  identifies  as  the 
perception  of  depth,  peripheral  vision,  visual  search,  visual 
processing speed and color perception (Navarra & Waterhouse, 
2019). 

These are accompanied by a process of reduction of sensation 
to cognition linked to the areas of frontal attention, therefore, 
recent  studies  have  shown  that  differences  in  the  space  of 
perceptual similarity influence individual attention (Rothlein et 
al., 2016) modulating the degree of behavioral interference due 
to the similarity in the visual search task. 

5.2  Memory Function 
Memory  performs  a  complex  mental  process  through  the 
coding, maintenance and retrieval of stored information (Parra-
Bolaños,  Fidel,  &  de  la  Peña,  2017), although  recent studies 
have shown that damage to the temporal lobes can affect this 
capacity,  the  performance  in  short-term  tasks  is  not  affected 
(López, 2011).  

Within the neurophysiology of mnemonic processes, literature 
has established over time he links between the prefrontal cortex 
and working memory (Santana, 2007). The latter is defined as 
a mechanism to store and use information available for a short 
period  of  time  (Gontier  B.,  2011),  and  within  the  process  of 
information  management,  the  prospective  memory  has  been 
conceptualized as an ability to remember and carry out certain 
operations in the future (Grandi & Tirapu-Ustárroz, 2017), this 
entails a process of information retrieval at the moment which 
is required of it (Fombuena, 2016).  

Demonstrating  its importance in the  processes  of  coding  and 
interpretation of stored information, understanding that short-
term memories develop sufficient semantic recovery resources 
(Luna-Lario,  Peña,  &  Ojeda,  2017).  Although  the  iconic 
memory demands and requires attention (Parra-Bolaños et al., 
2017)  identifying  in  this  way  a  relationship  of  this  type  of 
memory with attention. 

5.3  Attention Function 
The  different  neural  networks  distributed  at  the  cortical  and 
subcortical  level,  such  as  the  reticular  formation,  amygdala, 
thalamus,  basal  ganglia,  parietal  cortex,  frontal  cortex  and 
prefrontal  cortex,  are  involved  in  care  (Parra-Bolaños  et  al., 
2017) however,  this is  actively  involved  in  executive  control 
and detection of stimuli. 

Recent  studies  have  shown  that  developing  preparatory 
attentional  processes  suppose  success  in  prospective  tasks 
(Grandi & Tirapu-Ustárroz, 2017) since one of the qualities of 
attention  is  to  help  the  extraction  of  the  characteristics  of  a 
stimulus,  thus  increasing  the  brain  activity  involved  in  the 
processing of it (Ruiz-Contreras & Cansino, 2005). 

Within  the  neurophysiological  aspects,  the  neural  networks 
involved in the attention, such as the warning or alert system, 
are responsible for maintaining the processes of receptivity to 
the stimuli, helping to prepare the response (Bartés-Serrallonga 
et  al.,  2014),  located  in  the  thalamus,  which  receives  the 
information that comes from the senses. 
Within the processes of attention, the relevance of the decision 
pre-supposes  a  concrete  action  determined  in  diverse  neural 
influences (Santana, 2007), starting from the influence of the 
sensory  areas  of  the  posterior  cortex  in  the  motivations  and

stimuli, in stronger stimulus environments.

7.  DISCUSSION AND ACADEMIC 
IMPLICATIONS  
7.1  The Metatheory of Learning and 
Virtual Immersion Environments 
The need for a revision arose in part from the problem of the 
vacuum  that  exists  in  this  research  topic.  In  addition,  this 
motivation  began  by  the  literature  analysis  based  in  the 
theoretical evidence that integrates concepts and mechanisms 
in traditional learning within new virtual environment learning. 
The review of literature showed that this phenomenon is fertile 
ground  for  such  attempts  because  several  studies  point  to  a 
relationship  between  stimuli  and  information  processing 
through  the  use  of  memory,  as  well  as  the  relationship  of 
cognitive processes with attention.  

The  challenges  and  advances  discussed  so  far  relate  to  the 
findings  found  in  the  literature  review  that  addresses  the 
relationship between the identified constructs (Income Stimuli, 
Information  Management  and  Cognitive  Processing)  and  the 
establishment  of  a  research  agenda  on  how  to  identify  the 
necessary  indicators  to  measure  memory  and  attention in  the 
virtual immersion environments.
