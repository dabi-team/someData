ABSTRACT

The GLITP collaboration observed the ﬁrst gravitational lens system (QSO

0957+561) from 2000 February 3 to 2000 March 31. The daily V R observa-

tions were made with the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope at Roque de los

Muchachos Observatory, La Palma (Spain). We have derived detailed and ro-

bust V R light curves of the two components Q0957+561A and Q0957+561B.

In spite of the excellent sampling rate, we have not found evidence in favor

of true daily variability. With respect to variability on time-scales of several

weeks, we measure V R gradients of about −0.8 mmag/day in Q0957+561A

and +0.3 mmag/day in Q0957+561B. The gradients are very probably orig-

inated in the far source, thus adopting this reasonable hypothesis (intrinsic

variability), we compare them to the expected gradients during the evolution

of a compact supernova remnant at the redshift of the source quasar. The

starburst scenario is roughly consistent with some former events, but the new

gradients do not seem to be caused by supernova remnant activity.

INTRODUCTION

In some aspects the ﬁrst lensed quasar QSO 0957+561 is a relatively enigmatic system.

Although there is an agreement on the range for the optical time delay between its compo-

nents ∆tBA, and currently, a rough interval of 415–430 days seems incontrovertible (Pelt et

al. 1996; Kundi´c et al. 1997; Oscoz et al. 1997; Pijpers 1997; Pelt et al. 1998; Serra-Ricart

et al. 1999; Oscoz et al. 2001; Slavcheva-Mihova, Oknyanskij & Mihov 2001; Ovaldsen et

al. 2003a), we have clear evidence for diﬀerent delays associated with diﬀerent pairs of twin

intrinsic events (Goicoechea 2002). The light curves of both images in this gravitational

mirage show variability on very diﬀerent timescales, but when one concentrates on the well-

sampled intrinsic events with an amplitude of about 100 mmag and lasting several months,

there are detected three diﬀerent delays. The three delays between twin events are basically

included in the previously quoted interval. In principle, the presence of multiple delays could

indicate that local and violent physical phenomena (ﬂares) are taking place in a source with

ﬁnite size, and thus, the time delay distribution may be a basic tool to discuss the size and

nature of the region of ﬂares (Yonehara 1999). The existence of an extended region of ﬂares

implies that the optical source in QSO 0957+561 could be made of the standard engine

(accretion disc around a supermassive black hole) and at least other structure. A circum-

nuclear stellar region with starburst activity, a second accretion disc (binary black hole) or

jets with optical activity are good candidates to be a companion structure of the standard

one. These ﬁndings encourage to carry out new monitoring campaigns of several months per

year, which must be useful to ﬁnd new pairs of twin intrinsic events and to map the positions

of the ﬂares in the quasar. Even a multiband monitoring during only a few months may be

important, since the hypothetical presence of a prominent event (very probably caused by

an intrinsic ﬂare; see here below) would serve to analyze the duration, the released energy,

and the origin of the ﬂare associated with it. For example, Collier (2001) suggested that

comparing the event in two optical bands, one could obtain a non-zero chromatic lag of ∼

1 day (supporting the reverberation within an accretion disc), or maybe, an accurate zero

lag (indicating the absence of disc reprocessing). To be successful with these studies, very

precise and well-sampled brightness records are needful.

The existence of rapid and very rapid microlensing variability has also been studied for

several authors. At present the IAC group has carefully analyzed four diﬀerence light curves

corresponding to the 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000 observing seasons in the R band.

The observations were made with the 0.82-m IAC-80 telescope at the Teide Observatory,

and the diﬀerence light curves showed noisy behaviours around the zero line and no rapid

(with a duration of months) events (see Gil-Merino et al. 2001 for details on the ﬁrst two

diﬀerence curves). In fact all the IAC diﬀerence signal can be due to observational noise.

These conclusions agree with the results derived from the g-band photometric measurements

at the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5-m telescope for the period 1995-1996 (Kundi´c

et al. 1995; 1997). Schmidt & Wambsganss (1998) did not ﬁnd reliable microlensing imprints

in the light curves by Kundi´c et al. (1995, 1997). Therefore, there is a strong evidence against

the existence of rapid microlensing in the components of the system, and very probably, all

the features on a few months timescale are originated in the source quasar. Only the studies

based on the CfA frames (CCD images taken with the 1.2-m telescope at Fred Lawrence

Whipple Observatory) disagree with this point of view. However, the rapid ”microlensing”

events found by Schild (1996) (see also Ovaldsen et al. 2003a) could be related to either

some kind of observational noise (underestimation of errors) or the assumption of a unique

delay. We note that the 1.2-m telescope on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, did not work in very good

conditions: angular resolution of about 0.65 arcsec/pixel, mean seeing value (FWHM) of

around 2 arcsec, and PSFs with coma-like appearance (Ovaldsen et al. 2003a). On the other

hand, the assumption of a unique delay does not seem suitable in the analysis of large records

including several features. In fact, using small segments of the whole records, some probes

suggested the existence of three well-separated delays (Ovaldsen, private communication).

The very rapid microlensing events (with timescales ranging from a few days to a few weeks)

and the ultrarapid extrinsic events, which were reported by Schild and collaborators (e.g.,

Schild 1996, Colley & Schild 2003), are more subtle than the rapid ones and as far as we

know they have not been rejected/conﬁrmed yet. In order to discuss this topic in a proper

way, both the very accurate knowledge of the involved time delays and excellent photometric

data are required.

The Gravitational Lenses International Time Project (GLITP) is a program to observe,

analyze, and interpret gravitational mirages and related objects. In particular, the optical

monitoring (OM) subproject focus on the light curves of the systems QSO 0957+561 and

QSO 2237+0305. In this paper (Sections 2 and 3) we present new V R light curves for the two

components A–B of QSO 0957+561 (zs = 1.41). The GLITP-OM/Q0957+561 project was

conceived (amongst other things) to search for gradients in the light curves of the system, so

the study by Ovaldsen et al. (2003b) and our eﬀort are complementary works. Ovaldsen et

Ull´an et al.

al. (2003b) discussed the hourly and daily variability, while we address the daily, weekly and

monthly variability (Section 3). In Section 4, we compare the observed V -band gradients

and the expected ones after a supernova explosion inside a high-density medium at z = zs

= 1.41. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our main conclusions.

2 V R OBSERVATIONS AND FIRST LIGHT CURVES

We observed QSO 0957+561 from 2000 February 3 to 2000 March 31, i.e., during two months

in 2000. All observations were made with the 2.56-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) at the

Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, Canary Islands (Spain). The images were taken with

StanCam, a camera which uses a SITe 1024×1024 CCD detector with a 0.176 arcsec/pixel

scale. In the observing season, exposures in the V and R ﬁlters were taken every other night

when clear. For each monitoring night, in general, we have three consecutive exposures, i.e.,

one 300 s exposure in the V passband and two 150 s exposures in the R passband. As usual

the preprocessing of the data included bias subtraction and ﬂat-ﬁelding using sky ﬂats.

To obtain the V R light curves of Q0957+561A and Q0957+561B, we use two diﬀerent

data processing techniques. In this section, we focus on a ﬁrst photometry from the pho2com

task. In a given optical band, from the pho2com technique we can infer the diﬀerence, in

terms of magnitude, of the A–B components to a selected ﬁeld star (for details on the

whole procedure and the ﬁeld stars, see Serra-Ricart et al. 1999). The D star is chosen as

the reference candle, and so, brightness records mA − mD and mB − mD are derived and
properly analyzed. The mean FWHM of the seeing disc was below 1′′ for about 35–40% of

nights in the V and R bands. The initial V -band light curves show a rare behaviour around

2000 February 18 and 2000 March 14, which is similar in both components. Therefore, to

avoid the presence of artifacts, we ﬁlter the initial V brightness records by dropping the

ﬂuxes that are in strong disagreement with the two adjacent data, and provided that the

discrepancies simultaneously occur in both components. Our ﬁltering criterion is simple:

”strong disagreement” means a diﬀerence exceeding three times the photometric error and

”adjacent data” means the previous and subsequent ﬂuxes, when they are situated within

one week of the ﬂux of interest. The procedure leads to 31 good data for each component

in the V ﬁlter (6 data are dropped in the ﬁltering process). The R-band photometry does

not show any anomaly, and in consequence, we consider the 36 initial red data for each

component as the red dataset. To test the quality of the R-band monitoring, in Fig. 1 we

depict the distribution of formal errors in mA − mD and mB − mD (top panel), and the

distribution of time separations between adjacent data (bottom panel). We note that the

mean error is of about 10 mmag and the sampling rate is excellent. In Figure 2, we show

the light curves for QSO 0957+561: Q0957+561A in the V and R bands (left-hand and

right-hand top panels, respectively) and Q0957+561B in the V and R bands (left-hand and

right-hand bottom panels, respectively). As it was discussed in Fig. 5 of Serra-Ricart et al.

(1999), the subtraction of the lens galaxy is not perfect, and some of its light could be still

present in the mB − mD ﬂuxes. Therefore, the true mB − mD ﬂuxes may be out of the

formal error bars, and it should be considered an additional correction. The contribution of

the residual galactic light can be derived from simulations (Serra-Ricart et al. 1999) or from

another data processing technique. Thus, to take into account the residual galactic light and

check the reliability of the mA − mD trends, we also use a PSF ﬁtting code: the psfphot task.

This PSF photometry scheme is applied in the next section.

As a reminder, we note that the pho2com task combines aperture photometry for ref-

erence stars and PSF ﬁtting for reference stars and the two QSO components. First, the

reference star ﬂuxes are extracted through aperture photometry with a variable aperture

of radius 2×FWHM. Second, PSF ﬁtting photometry, within a circle of radius FWHM, is

applied to all the objects. Third, aperture corrections are computed from the previous data

to compare the QSO component ﬂuxes (aperture of radius 2×FWHM) with the reference

star ones. This photometry code only attempts to ﬁt the brightest region of the two QSO

components, so that the lens galaxy is not taken into account. Therefore, if one QSO compo-

nent is near to the lens galaxy and it is aﬀected by galactic light, then the pho2com ﬂuxes of

the contaminated component will be overestimated. Moreover, both the galaxy/component

confusion and the bias in the component ﬂux will depend on the seeing (FWHM). This

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

last fact was clearly proved in Serra-Ricart et al., and using the results from PSF ﬁtting

photometry, it is tested in the next section.

3 FINAL LIGHT CURVES AND VARIABILITY

In order to get ﬁnal and robust V R light curves of the two components Q0957+561A and

Q0957+561B, we apply the psfphot photometric method (e.g., McLeod et al. 1998), which is

useful for extracting clean QSO ﬂuxes (free of background, cross-contamination and contami-

nation by the galaxy light). Assuming a de Vaucouleurs proﬁle convolved with a point-spread

function (PSF) as the observed lens galaxy proﬁle, one can measure the brightness of the

two quasar components through PSF ﬁtting. The ﬂux of the comparison star (D) can also be

measured by means of PSF ﬁtting. Obviously, constant backgrounds are included to model

the two regions of interest: the lens system (Q0957+561A + Q0957+561B + lens galaxy)

and the D star. We use the clean two-dimensional proﬁles of three ﬁeld stars (G, H and

E) as empirical PSFs. Our framework is close to the methodology presented in Section 3 of

Alcalde et al. (2002). Because of both the relatively faint bright of the elliptical lens galaxy

in the frames and the proximity between the galaxy centre and the B component peak, we

determine the relevant information on the galaxy from the best images (in terms of seeing

values). Therefore, we apply the code to each image with a seeing (FWHM) better than

1.5 arcsec, using the brightest reference PSF and allowing all parameters to be free. For

some frames, the method is not able to accurately extract several physical parameters of the

lens galaxy, leading to results in apparent disagreement with the global distributions. Thus,

in the estimation of each parameter, we follow a scheme with two steps. First, the values

with a deviation (= value − average) exceeding the standard one are dropped. Second, the

parameter is inferred from the average of the ”surviving” values. Finally, we obtain the mor-

phological parameters of the galaxy (i.e., the eﬀective radius, Reﬀ , the ellipticity, ǫ, and the

position angle, P.A.), the relative position of the galaxy (position relative to the A compo-

nent) and the relative ﬂux Γ = fgal/fD. After, we apply the code to all images (whatever

their seeings), setting the galaxy parameters to those derived in the previous step (Reﬀ, ǫ,

P.A., relative position and Γ), using galaxy ﬂuxes given by fgal = Γ × fD and allowing the

remaining parameters to vary. In this last iteration, all the available PSFs are used. As the

H star is relatively bright and it is present in most frames, the brightness records from the

PSF of the H star are regarded as the standard ones.

Figure 3. Standard residual curves in the R band (psfphot). It is evident the strong correlation between the residues for
Q0957+561A (solid line) and the residual signal for Q0957+561B (dashed line). A few prominent peaks exceed the ± 20 mmag
levels (dotted lines).

The standard R-band light curves yA = mA − mD and yB = mB − mD can be ﬁtted to

linear gradients gA(t) and gB(t), respectively, in such a way that yA(tj) = gA(tj) + rA(tj)

and yB(tj) = gB(tj) + rB(tj), where tj represent the observation dates, and rA and rB are

residual signals. By doing the ﬁts, we derive two very diﬀerent gradients gA and gB, which

reasonably describe intrinsic variations in two diﬀerent QSO epochs. Moreover, some to us

surprise, we obtain very similar residues rA and rB. These residual signals are drawn in Figure

3, where we see rA (solid line), rB (dashed line) and ± 20 mmag levels (dotted lines). In the

past, other authors have also found some zero-lag correlation between the variations of both

components (e.g., Ovaldsen et al. 2003a, b and references therein). The R-band residues could

be mainly originated by either observational systematic noise or physical phenomena inside

the Milky Way. A physical phenomenon in the far source would be seen at a certain time in

Q0957+561A and very much later in Q0957+561B (see Introduction). In our photometry,

the observational noise seems to be the source of the residual variability. The prominent

peaks in Fig. 3 correspond to good images in terms of seeing (FWHM < 1.5 arcsec), but bad

images in relation to the determination of the lens galaxy parameters (see here above). If the

photometric method is not able to accurately extract the galaxy information, then it seems

reasonable to ﬁnd a peak of noise in the measurement of other quantities, e.g., the QSO

ﬂuxes. Hereafter, the R-band residual signals are assumed to be observational (systematic

+ random) noise. This hypothesis is also justiﬁed in the next paragraph. We wish to remark

that the residues in Fig. 3 are not related to the galaxy model from superbGLITP images.

In fact, in a ﬁrst photometric stage, we used the relative astrometry and proﬁle of the lens

galaxy from HST (Hubble Space Telescope) observations. However, as we found a clear

systematic in the residual signals, we thought that this systematic could be due to the

external constraints, which were derived in other experiments. Hence, taking into account

the high quality of the superbGLITP images, we ﬁnally decided to use a self-consistent

photometry code that is only based on the GLITP experiment. Our ﬁnal results are similar

to the ﬁrst ones obtained from HST constraints, so the systematic residues in Fig. 3 are not

caused by the superbGLITP galaxy model. In the R band, we get Reﬀ = 3.8 ± 0.8 arcsec, ǫ

= 0.32 ± 0.05 and P.A. = 58 ± 9 deg, while in the V band, the galaxy parameters are Reﬀ

= 3.0 ± 1.0 arcsec, ǫ = 0.2 ± 0.2 and P.A. = 40 ± 21 deg. The HST galaxy ellipticity and

position angle vary in the ranges 0.1–0.3 and 40–60 deg, respectively (Bernstein et al. 1997).

By discarding the frames that lead to prominent peaks of noise in the two QSO compo-

signal.

nents, we get a new standard photometry in the R band. The new light curves are ﬁtted

to linear gradients and the residual signals are estimated again. In Figure 4 we see the new

standard R-band light curves from psfphot together with the corresponding ﬁts. For the A

component, we measure a rise of − 0.72 ± 0.08 mmag/day during six weeks, whereas for the

typical uncertainties are eA = hr2

B component, we derive a decrease of + 0.20 ± 0.09 mmag/day for the same period. The
Bi1/2 ≈ 6 mmag. In order to
test the reliability of our hypothesis (the residual signals represent the observational noise

Ai1/2 ≈ 5 mmag and eB = hr2

in the QSO ﬂuxes), we also study the new standard R-band values of yE = mE − mD.

The E star is the faintest ﬁeld star, although it is about 1.7 magnitudes brighter than the A

component. The yE values (ﬁlled circles) and the rA residues (properly shifted in magnitude;

solid line) are shown in Figure 5. Both trends have ﬂuctuations of similar amplitude, and

the rms of the yE − hyEi signal is eE ≈ 4 mmag. As the QSO components are fainter than

the E star and they are placed on a crowded region of the images, the photometric errors

eA and eB should be greater than eE. So, we obtained a totally consistent result: eA and

eB are 1–2 mmag above eE. An important fact to remark is that the new standard R-band

records are stable against the change of the reference PSF. We also note the high accuracy

of the PSF photometry in the R band (QSO ﬂuxes with uncertainties of ∼ 5 mmag), which

permits to detect gradients less than 1 mmag/day.

In Figure 6, it appears a comparison between the pho2com (open symbols) and psfphot

(ﬁlled symbols) photometries in the R band. At ﬁrst sight, the behaviour of yA(pho2com) is

the excellent agreement between the A ﬂuxes from both techniques and the smooth behaviour of the B ﬂuxes from psfphot.

very close to the evolution of yA(psfphot). From a quantitative point of view, the mean rela-

tive deviation h|yA(pho2com) − yA(psf phot)|/edevi is of 0.9. On the other hand, there is no

agreement between the yB(pho2com) and yB(psfphot) trends. The light curve yB(pho2com)

is contaminated by residual galactic light, with a mean contamination of hyB(pho2com) −

yB(psf phot)i ≈ − 70 mmag. We adopt the PSF ﬁtting results as a ﬁnal and robust pho-

tometry that includes clean ﬂuxes of the B component as well as very reliable ﬂuxes of the

A component.

The standard V -band brightness records yA and yB can also be ﬁtted to linear gradients.

From the ﬁts, we infer results similar to the previous ones in the R band, i.e., very diﬀerent

gradients and close residual signals. The rms of the residual signals is of 13–15 mmag, and

we think that the V -band residues are due to observational noise, just like the R-band

ones. The proof of it is that two images taken the same night (2000 February 4) lead to

Q0957+561A ﬂuxes separated by 22 mmag and Q0957+561B ﬂuxes separated by 17 mmag,

so the around 20 mmag intrahour deviations (due to observational quasi-systematic noise)

are comparable to the diﬀerences yA(tj)−yA(tj+1) ≈ rA(tj)−rA(tj+1) and yB(tj)−yB(tj+1) ≈

rB(tj) − rB(tj+1), where tj and tj+1 are two consecutive observation nights. By discarding

the frames with good seeing and poor imprints of the lens galaxy (the photometric method

does not ﬁnd the galaxy parameters in a right way; see here above), the Q0957+561A

light curve is consistent with a rise of − 0.89 ± 0.12 mmag/day during six weeks, and the

Q0957+561B record agrees with a decrease of + 0.36 ± 0.13 mmag/day for a 45 days period.

These V gradients are marginally consistent with the R ones (1σ conﬁdence levels), and we

cannot assure the existence of chromatic variations. Moreover, the rms of the residual signals

decrease up to eA ≈ 9 mmag and eB ≈ 10 mmag. We get again a very good photometry with

uncertainties below 10 mmag level, although the R-band data are better than the V -band

ones. The rms of yE − hyEi is of about 3 mmag, and consequently, eA and eB are three

times the typical error in the E star ﬂux. Along all this paragraph, we deal with a standard

photometry (based on the PSF of the H star). However, a change in the reference PSF does

not modify the photometric results (e.g., using the PSF of the E star instead of the standard

PSF).

In Figure 7 we can see a comparison of the psfphot (ﬁlled circles and squares) and pho2com

(open circles and squares) light curves in the V band. Fig. 7 reveals two important facts: (1)

there are no signiﬁcant deviations between the yA measurements from both methods, with

h|yA(pho2com) − yA(psf phot)|/edevi = 0.7, and (2) the light curve yB(psfphot) seems to be

free of contamination by the galaxy light, while yB(pho2com) has a mean contamination of

hyB(pho2com) − yB(psf phot)i ≈ − 50 mmag. Thus, the psfphot dataset is our ﬁnal (and

robust) photometry in the V band. The ﬁnal V R light curves are available on request.

Once we have V R light curves of Q0957+561B from pho2com and another photomet-

ric procedure which extracts ﬂuxes without contamination by galaxy light (psfphot), it is

possible to check the expected correlation between the contamination of the pho2com ﬂuxes

and the seeing (FWHM). In Fig. 8, the R-band and V -band contaminations are depicted as

function of seeing. The expected linear trends (see Serra-Ricart et al.) are conﬁrmed in this

work. We obtain contamination laws (in magnitudes): CR = 0.0497×FWHM + 0.0063 and

CV = 0.0243×FWHM + 0.0119, that qualitatively agree with the Serra-Ricart et al.’s ones.

Very recently, Ovaldsen et al. (2003b) presented V R photometry of QSO 0957+561 from

four consecutive nights of intensive monitoring at the NOT. They did not ﬁnd clear ﬂuc-

tuations within each night, but reported day-to-day ﬂuctuations of a few milli-magnitudes.

The authors also discussed the zero-lag correlation between the A and B light curves, and

did not obtain a fair conclusion about the nature of the observed variability: true (physical)

variations or observational noise. Our photometry shows a daily variability which is very

similar in the two QSO components, and we justiﬁed that the day-to-day variations are due

to observational noise. However, in order to go further on, we can try to look for the origin

of the noise, or in other words, to answer the question: which is the reason for the peaks of

noise?. Using the ﬁrst photometric results (before to discard the bad frames), in Fig. 9, we

examine the amplitudes of the residues for Q0957+561A as a function of seeing (FWHM).

The ﬁlled and open circles represent the R-band and V -band amplitudes, respectively. In

Fig. 9, as the seeing is worse, relatively small residues appear. Most the prominent peaks of

noise correspond to nights with good seeing conditions. This probes that bad seeing condi-

tions do not cause the peaks of noise. As it was noted at the end of Sec. 6 in Colley & Schild

(1999), the PSF may vary over the ﬁeld because of the optics of the telescope and camera,

and the variation may be more signiﬁcant in good seeing conditions. Alternatively, the ef-

fective PSF associated with each object could depend on the object ﬂux, the background

ﬂux and other factors, so the stellar PSFs would be diﬀerent to the PSF of the components.

Therefore, we feel that a slight mismatch between the reference PSF and the PSF in the

lens system region could be the responsible for the peaks of noise. This possibility can be

tested from two images in the R band, one leading to small noise (2000 March 12) and other

corresponding to the maximum noise in Fig. 9 (2000 February 18). After subtracting the

background in the pixels associated with the lens system, we analyze the lens system region.

While in March 12, observed instrumental ﬂuxes and modelled instrumental ﬂuxes are very

similar in both the central region and the tail of the QSO components, in February 18, there

are clear diﬀerences between the observed ﬂuxes and the modelled ones.

Apart from the day-to-day variability, uncorrelated gradients on several weeks time-

scales are unambiguously detected, so we can reasonably consider these variations on longer

time-scales as true ﬂuctuations originated in the far quasar. In the next section, taking into

account the observed gradients, we test the feasibility of a possible physical scenario.

4 GLITP V -BAND GRADIENTS AND SUPERNOVA REMNANT

ACTIVITY

In recent papers, using a starburst model, several authors tried to explain the optical vari-

ability of QSOs (Aretxaga, Cid Fernandes & Terlevich 1997; Kawaguchi et al. 1998; Hawkins

2002). The starburst model consists of a central stellar cluster whose luminosity comes from

the stars, the type II supernova explosions and the activity of supernova remnants. The

details on the B-band supernova(SN)/supernova remnant(SNR) luminosity curve appear

in Aretxaga & Terlevich (1994) and Aretxaga, Cid Fernandes & Terlevich (1997). In this

scenario, there are not a supermassive black hole and an accretion disc associated with it.

16

Ull´an et al.

From a large sample of AGNs, Hawkins (2002) ruled out a pure starburst model. On the

other hand, a picture including only a starburst nucleus is not suitable for QSO 0957+561,

since Kawaguchi et al. (1998) claimed that the measured slope of the ﬁrst-order structure

function is in clear disagreement with the model. However, QSO 0957+561 could be powered

by several independent mechanisms (e.g., a nuclear accretion disc together with a circum-

nuclear stellar region), so SN/SNR events must be not discarded as candidates to justify

some ﬂuctuations in the light curves of the system. In fact, Goicoechea (2002) suggested

that two prominent g-band ﬂuctuations in the QSO 0957+561 light curves may be consis-

tent with circumnuclear starburst events. The suggestion was exclusively based on the time

delay distribution and rough time-energy criteria, and the shape of the events was not taken

into account. In this section, we are going to properly discuss the starburst origin of the two

prominent APO g-band variations as well as the two GLITP V -band gradients. We note

that the existence of a circumnuclear stellar region including young stars, starburst activity

and so on, is also supported by another recent work. Apart from the central (nuclear) far

UV emission, Hutchings (2003) reported the presence of a circumnuclear far UV emission

within a radius of 0.3 arcsec.

The SN/SNR luminosity is dominated by the standard SNR peak (e.g., Aretxaga, Cid

Fernandes & Terlevich 1997; Kawaguchi et al. 1998). The rise from t = 0.3tsg to t = tsg and

the subsequent power-law decline deﬁne the SNR event, which is the main feature of the

total emission. The initial SN ﬂash (steep rise at t = 0 and decay at t > 0) and the peaks

associated with cooling instabilities are secondary features. As usual, tsg is the time when

the SNR reaches the maximum of its radiative phase. We only consider main events (i.e.,

SNR ones) and test the possible relation between SNR activity and several ﬂuctuations in

the records of QSO 0957+561 (see here above). First of all, from the light curve of one image

in an optical band, it is deduced the background magnitude. If the central wavelength of the

ﬁlter’s bandpass is λ0, then we derive mback(λ0). Using standard laws (e.g., L´ena, Lebrun

& Mignard 1998), this background magnitude can be converted to a monochromatic ﬂux

Fback(λ0). We note that the observed background ﬂux at λ0 is emitted at a shorter wavelength

λ = λ0/(1 + zs). Secondly, m(λ0) = mback(λ0) − 2.5 log[F (λ0)/Fback(λ0)], where F (λ0) =

Fback(λ0)+FSN R(λ0). Hence, in a direct way, we obtain the relationship m(λ0) = mback(λ0)−

2.5 log(1 + f ), with f = FSN R(λ0)/Fback(λ0). Therefore, the ﬂuctuation induced by the SNR

activity depends on the ratio betweeen the observed SNR ﬂux and the observed background

ﬂux. Thirdly, to account for the observed SNR ﬂux, we must use the cosmological law

GLITP optical monitoring of QSO 0957+561

17

λ0FSN R(λ0) = τSN R[λLSN R(λ)]/(4πD2

L), where LSN R(λ) is the monochromatic luminosity,

τSN R is the extinction-magniﬁcation factor and DL is the luminosity distance. During the

cooling epoch at t ≥ tsg (e.g., Shull 1980; Terlevich et al. 1992), a luminosity Lshock is

emitted outward by the forward shock. Most of the energy is radiated in the far UV and X-

rays, but the initial spectrum could be distorted from the interaction with the unperturbed

circumstellar material. In general, the emergent luminosity will be less than Lshock. An

important reprocessing occurs by means of the interaction between the radiation emitted

inwards (with a luminosity Lshock) and the outer ultradense shell. Half of the reprocessed

luminosity (in the outer shell) is reemitted outward, and it should also cross the unperturbed

circumstellar medium. Therefore, λLSN R(λ) = ǫnuv(2Lshock), where ǫnuv is the near UV

eﬃciency, or equivalently, the ratio between the emergent near UV luminosity and the total

luminosity by the forward shock. We consider the emission of near UV light (λ ≈ 2100–2300
˚A), because we deal with observations in the g (λ0 ≈ 5067 ˚A) and V (λ0 ≈ 5500 ˚A) bands.
All the estimations are made in a cosmology with ΩΛ = 0, ΩM = 1 and H = 66 km s−1
Mpc−1.

The key function f has a general form: C(x/tsg0)[(t0 − 0.3tsg0)/0.7tsg0] at 0.3tsg0 ≤ t0 ≤
tsg0, and C(x/tsg0)(tsg0/t0)11/7 at t0 ≥ tsg0. The times are not rest-frame ones, but times

measured by the observer at redshift zero. A constant factor C includes cosmological eﬀects,

the magniﬁcation of the light by the lens and so on, whereas the parameter x = ǫE51 is related
to the energy of the SNR in units of 1051 erg (E51) and a global eﬃciency ǫ = ǫdustǫnuv <

1. The global eﬃciency incorporates the extinction by dust in the host and lens galaxies

and the Milky Way (ǫdust). We begin with the analysis of the APO g-band variations in the

light curve of Q0957+561B (Kundi´c et al. 1997). In this ﬁrst study, the C value is of 1. It

is not diﬃcult to roughly ﬁt the two prominent observed peaks. In Figure 10 we show both

the observed trends (ﬁlled squares) and the ﬁts (open circles). We do not ﬁt the secondary

features that appear just before each peak (for example, see the behaviour between the days

1050 and 1080), which could be associated with the SN explosions. For the main peak around

day 1105, the SNR parameters are x = 6 and tsg0 = 25 days, while for the peak around

day 1180, the parameters are x = 3 and tsg0 = 30 days. The x values are in agreement with

high energies E ≥ 1052 erg. These energies slightly exceed the expected ones for type II

SNe and are similar to the energy released in the explosions of hypernovae. However, for a

well-followed-up type II supernova (SN 1988Z), there is evidence in favor of a total radiated

energy close to 1052 erg (Aretxaga et al. 1999). From the time-scales tsg0 ≈ 25–30 days, we

n7 is the circumstellar density in units of 107 cm−3, one can easily ﬁnd a density of n ≥
109 cm−3. This high density is not so surprising (e.g., Filippenko 1989), and the energy and

environmental density values do not permit to rule out the hypothesis of SNR activity.

On the other hand, in the previous section, we report that the GLITP V -band photome-

try has two well-deﬁned gradients: one rise in Q0957+561A and one decline in Q0957+561B.

Are these gradients roughly consistent with SNR activity?. We try to answer this query

from SNR simulations. In the new analysis, we focus on the time derivatives (gradients)

dm(λ0)/dt0 (mmag/day) = − 1086 (1 + f )−1(df /dt0). The GLITP gradients have a duration

of about 45 days, so we only consider tsg0 values longer than 50 days. In Figure 11 we present

the results of the simulations: rises for the A component (C = 2.92) and declines for the B

component (C = 2.04). We take four representative values of x, i.e., x = 0.25 (triangles),

x = 0.75 (squares), x = 1.25 (circles) and x = 2.5 (stars). With respect to the declines

(Q0957+561B), we cannot fairly reproduce a constant fall of 0.3–0.4 mmag/day during a

time interval of 45 days. For tsg0 > 150 days, the declines are signiﬁcantly smaller than the

observed one, while for shorter tsg0 values, a 45 days decline of about 0.35 mmag/day do

not seem to be plausible. With respect to the rises (Q0957+561A), the observed gradient is

consistent with a SNR scenario. A 45 days rise of about 0.9 mmag/day may be explained

from the simulations in the left-hand top panel of Fig. 11. However, we can use some com-

plementary information on the feature in Q0957+561A. Oscoz et al. (2002) reported a large

brightness enhancement of the Q0957+561A component during the 2000 and 2001 monitor-

ing campaigns with the IAC-80 telescope (see Figs. 1 and 2 in that paper). They found a

250 mmag variation lasting 500 days, so that the 45 days GLITP rise corresponds to the

beginning of the brightness enhancement. Assuming a 500 days rise of about 0.5 mmag/day

(an average slope), the brightness increase must be due to a physical phenomenon diﬀerent

to SNR activity (see the right-hand bottom panel of Fig. 11). Indeed the GLITP+IAC data

suggest the existence of two non-starburst gradients in the light curves of QSO 0957+561.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have observed the lensed quasar QSO 0957+561 during two months in 2000, using the

StanCam/NOT instrument. From the daily V R images and PSF photometry, we inferred

very detailed V R light curves of the two components A and B. The ﬁnal brightness records

are characterized by the following properties:

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

20

Ull´an et al.

(i) In each optical band, the daily variability is similar in the two QSO components. We

justiﬁed that the correlated day-to-day ﬂuctuations are caused by observational (systematic

+ random) noise. The peaks of noise could be mainly due to the mismatch between the refer-

ence PSF and the PSF in the frame region where is placed the lens system. While the typical

R-band uncertainties are of about 5 mmag (Q0957+561A) and 6 mmag (Q0957+561B), the

typical V -band errors are of ≈ 9−10 mmag.

(ii) In each optical band, there are uncorrelated linear gradients on a six weeks time-scale.

For the A component, we measured rises of − 0.72 ± 0.08 mmag/day (in the R band) and −

0.89 ± 0.12 mmag/day (in the V band), whereas for the B component, we derived decreases

of + 0.20 ± 0.09 mmag/day (R-band) and + 0.36 ± 0.13 mmag/day (V -band). There is

some evidence for chromatic variability, but the V -band gradients are marginally consistent

with the R-band ones (using 1σ conﬁdence intervals).

As quoted in the previous paragraph, the observed V -band gradients have values below

one millimagnitude per day and a duration of about 45 days. We discussed a possible physical

scenario to account for these features: supernova remnant (SNR) activity. Two prominent

g-band variations reported by Kundi´c et al. (1997) are roughly consistent with the existence

of a circumnuclear starburst region, so the starburst origin of the new V -band gradients is

an attractive possibility. However, the observed decline (in Q0957+561B) is in disagreement

with SNR simulations. On the other hand, even though an optimistic result was obtained

from the comparison between the observed rise (in Q0957+561A) and SNR simulations,

extended observations of the rise (Oscoz et al. 2002) led to reject a starburst mechanism.

Therefore, we ﬁnally conclude that the new V -band gradients must be associated with

physical phenomena diﬀerent to SNR activity.
