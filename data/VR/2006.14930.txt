Abstract  

Collision sports athletes experience many head acceleration events (HAEs) per season. The effects 

of  these  subconcussive  events  are  largely  understudied  since  HAEs  may  produce  no  overt 

symptoms, and  are  likely to diffusely manifest  across multiple scales of  study (e.g.,  molecular, 

cellular  network,  and  behavior).  This  study  integrated  resting-state  fMRI  with  metabolome, 

transcriptome and computational virtual reality (VR) behavior  measures to assess the effects of 

exposure to HAEs on players in a collegiate American football team. Permutation-based mediation 

and  moderation  analysis  was  used  to  investigate  relationships  between  network  fingerprint, 

changes in omic measures and VR metrics over the season. Change in an energy cycle fatty acid, 

ÔÅÑtridecenedioate, moderated the relationship between 1) ÔÅÑmiR-505 and DMN fingerprint and 2) 

the  relationship  between  DMN  fingerprint  and  worsening  ÔÅÑVR  Balance  measures  (all

to cumulative number of HAEs above 80G, and DMN fingerprint was less similar across the season 

in athletes relative to age-matched non-athletes. ÔÅÑmiR-505 was also positively related to average 

number of HAEs above 25G per session. It is important to note that tridecenedioate has a double 

bond making it a candidate for ROS scavenging. These findings between a candidate ROS-related 

metabolite, inflammatory miRNA, altered brain imaging and diminished behavioral performance 

suggests  that  impact  athletes  may  experience  chronic  neuroinflammation.  The  rigorous 

permutation-based mediation/moderation may provide a methodology for investigating complex 

multi-scale  biological  data  within  humans  alone  and  thus  assist  study  of  other  functional  brain 

problems.

Introduction  

Athletes in impact sports may experience hundreds of so-called ‚Äúsubconcussive‚Äù events during a 

season that do not lead to overt concussive symptoms [1‚Äì4], but may lead to subtle alterations in 

brain structure and function [5‚Äì10]. Such events involve a direct blow to the head or an indirect 

acceleration or whiplash movement due to an impact elsewhere on the body, and are referred to as 

head acceleration events (HAE) [2]. Neuroimaging studies using functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion 

weighted imaging, perfusion imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have shown 

alterations in functional connectivity, working memory, cerebro-vascular reactivity, white matter 

integrity,  regional  cerebral  blood  flow,  and  neurometabolite  concentrations  in  asymptomatic 

collision sport athletes due to repeated HAE exposure [8,9,11‚Äì19] supporting multiple etiologic 

hypotheses  for  injury.  Many  etiological  hypotheses  about  the  mechanism  of  injury  have  been 

proposed, including: (1) neurovascular decoupling  [20‚Äì27] (2) neuroinflammation [28‚Äì34] and 

(3) diffuse axonal injury (DAI) [35‚Äì42]. Although these three models are independently supported 

by strong evidence, vascular function is a fundamental part of the initiation phase of inflammatory 

response, and its longer-term resolution phase [43,44], suggesting two of these three models have 

some overlap.  

The neuroinflammation model was the focus of a recent study on micro-RNA (miRNA) 

levels  before  and  over  the  course  of  the  football  season  for  miRNAs  related  to  inflammatory 

responses,  such  as  miR-505,  miR-30d,  and  miR-92a  [45].  The  panel  of  miRNAs  studied  had 

previously  been  shown  to  be  elevated  in  subjects  visiting  emergency  rooms  for  mild  to  severe 

traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI),  and  were  correlated  with  abnormal  clinical  readings  on  CT  scans 

[46].  miRNAs  represent  a  dynamic  measure  of  gene  function  and  are  part  of  the  transcriptome 

[47], targeting up to hundreds of mRNAs, and thus being involved in a wide variety of cellular 

3 

 
processes, including many of those that occur after the initial physical impact in head injuries, such 

as  the  initiation  of  inflammation,  or  its  longer-term  resolution  [48,49].  Inflammation  is  energy 

intensive and also leads to alterations in metabolomic profiles (i.e., individualized biochemistry) 

in  athletes,  as  suggested  by  several  recent  MRS  studies  of  mild  traumatic  brain  injury  (mTBI) 

[11,18,50‚Äì59].  In  parallel,  the  DAI  model  suggests  there  may  be  an  array  of  shock-wave 

abnormalities to axons and their structure, and given axon structure depends on a broad array of 

fatty acids (FAs), FAs might be an important focus for metabolomic study of HAE. One of the 

fundamental strengths of studying miRNA associated with neuroinflammation, or  metabolomic 

measures of  molecules  important for brain structural integrity or energetics, is  that  they  can be 

readily  sampled  in  peripheral  blood  [45,46].  This  strength  is  coupled,  in  turn,  with  the  parallel 

requirement that transcriptomic and metabolomic measures be connected to brain measures and 

the  computational  behavior  mediated  by  the  brain  that  is  relevant  to  HAEs  and  concussion.  In 

recent work, we found such connections between omic measures, brain imaging and computational 

behavior  could  be  quite  powerful,  specifically  with  an  observation  that  miR-30d  and  miR-92a 

mediated  more  than  70%  of  the  relationship  between  brain  imaging  and  a  virtual  reality  (VR) 

measure of motor control in football athletes [60].    

Core features of the diagnosis of concussion and accumulated HAEs  are disturbances of 

motor control in the form of coordination, balance, or the capacity to navigate, features that were 

a focus of research by Alexander Luria [61‚Äì63]. He noted that head impacts without clinical signs 

of  trauma  may  be  associated  with  chronic  neurocognitive  deficits  in  (a)  spatial  orientation  and 

accuracy of navigation, (b) processing of visual-spatial information (sensory-motor reactivity), or 

(c) related coordination functions such as whole-body postural control or balance [61‚Äì63]. Recent 

work with virtual reality (VR) technology has allowed these deficits to be tested using a validated 

4 

 
methodology  [64,65],    producing  computational  behavior  measures  of  (i)  spatial  navigation 

accuracy  (‚ÄúSpatial  Memory‚Äù),  (ii)  sensory-motor  reactivity  and  efficiency  of  visual-spatial 

processing (‚ÄúReaction Time‚Äù), and (iii) postural stability during equilibrium changes (‚ÄúBalance‚Äù), 

along  with  (iv)  an  integrative  metric  of  all  three  measures  together  (‚ÄúComprehensive‚Äù  score). 

Although a number of computer-based neuropsychological tests exist to assess aspects of Luria‚Äôs 

triad [i.e., (a) ‚Äì (c) above], VR can detect residual abnormalities in the absence of self-reported 

symptoms by HAE recipients [66].  

Connecting alterations in measures of motor control to in vivo brain alterations requires 

use of brain imaging such as resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), which measures the spontaneous neural 

activity in the brain and determines the default functional connectivity between brain regions. rs-

fMRI has gained wide-spread attention and is used to investigate brain functional connectivity in 

the  normal  healthy  brain  [67‚Äì71]  as  well  as  in  many  clinical  populations  including  mTBI 

[9,12,13,72‚Äì74]. A functional connectome (FC) is a symmetric square matrix that estimates the 

level of functional coupling of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal between pairs 

of brain regions. Robust individual differences in FCs have been termed a ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù, and are 

demonstrated by the self-identification of subjects by correlating repeat visits of the same subject 

[75‚Äì81]. Use of an association between individual differences in FCs (i.e., fingerprints) and motor 

control behavior would provide a fundamental way to assure that alterations in transcriptomics and 

metabolomics were related to HAEs, and not just inflammation based on orthopedic injury.  

Given this background, this study evaluated the hypothesis that omic measures from the 

transcriptome  (miRNA)  and  metabolome  (individualized  biochemistry)  would  mediate  or 

moderate the relationship of rs-fMRI measures to motor control behavior. We hypothesized these 

effects would be observed through three-way associations with computational behavior measures 

5 

 
across a season (i.e., pre- vs. post-season) of a football team. We predicted omic measures would 

show mediation/moderation relationships with imaging and behavioral measures, in line with our 

prior experience with imaging omics [60]. For the  miRNA measures, we focused on a panel of 

miRNAs that had previously been shown to be abnormal relative to emergency room controls in 

the pre-season, and across season for football players, and that were known to be involved in the 

control  of  inflammation  [45].  For  metabolomics,  we  focused  only  on  compounds  significantly 

altered over the season (with FDR correction and/or random forest assessment) that were (i) fatty 

acids  and/or  compounds  involved  with  energy  metabolism,  (ii)  compounds  involved  with 

stress/inflammatory  responses,  or  (iii)  exogenous  compounds  related  to  consumption.  For  rs-

fMRI, a network fingerprint approach was used to compare rs-fMRI measures across the season. 

The  broad  focus  of  this  imaging-omics  study  was  to  determine  if  identified  metabolomic 

compounds  and  inflammatory  miRNAs  mediated  or  moderated  the  relationship  of  rs-fMRI 

measures to motor control behaviors. Such a finding would go beyond the idea of an intermediate 

phenotype in ‚Äúimaging genetics‚Äù [82], wherein brain imaging acts as a common, overlapping node 

between  two  associations,  and  point  to  the  quantitative  integration  of  measures  across  multiple 

scales, using omics as opposed to genetic measures (that cannot be easily manipulated for clinical 

purposes). Omic measures such as metabolomics can be clinically manipulated, and their linkage 

to imaging and computational behavior suggests the possibility for mechanistic insight. To date, 

we  do  not  believe  that  imaging  omics  using  metabolomic  measures  has  been  described  in  the 

literature. To do this, given the large number of associations needing  testing for this study, we 

integrated permutation-based statistics with mediation/moderation analyses to directly address the 

issue of multiple comparisons.

Methods 

Participants and data collection 

Twenty-three  (23)  male  collegiate  varsity  student  football  athletes  (meanÔÇ±  standard 

deviation = 21ÔÇ±2 years) participated in this study. All participants provided informed consent, as 

approved  by  the  Penn  State  University  Institutional  Review  Board  and  in  alignment  with  the 

Declaration of Helsinki. No participants were excluded due to history of concussion. Self-reports 

of prior history of concussion (and associated counts) were given by 9 of 23 football athletes (1 

prior concussion: n = 7; 2 prior concussions: n = 2). Blood samples were taken prior to any contact 

practices (Pre) and within one week of the last game (Post). None of the subjects had a diagnosed 

concussion in the 9 months preceding preseason data collection. Blood samples were prepared and 

sent out for miRNA quantification and metabolomic analysis. Concurrent with blood collection, 

players also underwent virtual reality (VR) testing and MR imaging sessions. HAE measures were 

collected  over  the  season  (i.e.,  between  Pre  and  Post  blood,  imaging,  and  VR  sampling)  as 

described below. 

Head Acceleration Events (HAEs) monitoring 

Head acceleration events (HAEs) were monitored at all contact practice sessions (max = 

53; no games were monitored) using the BodiTrak sensor system from The Head Health Network. 

Sensors  were  mounted  in  each  active  player‚Äôs  helmet  prior  to  contact.  Sensor  outputs  included 

peak translational acceleration (PTA; G-units) and impact location. Two G-unit thresholds i.e. 25G 

and 80G were selected based on previous reports of impacts related to brain health and injury [83]. 

For  each  i-th  athlete  the  HAEs  were  quantified  as  cumulative  number  of  hits  exceeding  the 

threshold Th = 25G and 80G (cHAE25G,i and cHAE80G,i):

Serum Extraction 

Five  mL  of  blood  were  drawn  from  each  participant  at  Pre  and  Post  sessions.  Samples 

were placed in a serum separator tube, allowed to clot at room temperature, and then centrifuged. 

Serum  was  extracted  from  each  tube  and  pipetted  into  bar-coded  aliquot  tubes.  Serum  samples 

were  stored  at  -70¬∞C  until  they  were  transported  to  1)  a  central  laboratory  for  blinded  miRNA 

batch analysis [45] and 2) Metabolon (Morrisville, NC, USA) for blinded metabolite analysis.  

miRNA quantification 

Serum samples collected at Pre and Post sessions were used to isolate and quantify levels of RNA. 

100 ùúáL of serum was aliquoted and RNA was isolated using a serum/plasma isolation kit (Qiagen 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inc.,  Venlo,  Netherlands)  as  per  the  manufacturer‚Äôs  protocol.  RNA  was  eluted  in  20 ùúáL  of 

DNAse/RNAse-free water and stored at -80¬∞C until further use. 

Droplet  digital  PCR  (ddPCR;  Bio-Rad  Inc.,  Hercules,  CA,  USA)  was  used  to  quantify 

absolute  levels  of  nine  miRNA  (miR-20a,  miR-505,  miR-3623p,  miR-30d,  miR-92a,  miR-486, 

miR-195,  miR-93p,  miR-151-5p)  [45].  Prior  to  ddPCR  analysis,  RNA  was  checked  for  quality 

using a bioanalyzer assay with a small RNA assay. After quality confirmation, 10 ng of RNA was 

reverse  transcribed  using  specific  miRNA  TaqMan  assays  as  per  the  manufacturer‚Äôs  protocol 

(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Protocol details can be found in [45]. The 

final PCR product was analyzed using a droplet reader (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Total 

positive and negative droplets were quantified, and from this, the concentration of miRNA/ùúáL of 

the PCR reaction was reported. All reactions were performed in duplicate. 

Metabolomic Analysis 

The  remaining  serum  was  sent  to  Metabolon  (Morrisville,  NC,  USA)  for  metabolomic 

quantification.  Upon  arrival,  samples  were  assigned  a  unique  identifier  via  an  automated 

laboratory system and stored at -80¬∞C. Samples were prepared for subsequent analyses using an 

automated  MicroLab  STAR¬Æ  system  (Hamilton  Company,  Reno,  NV,  USA).  Proteins  were 

precipitated out of each sample using methanol and a shaker (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000), and 

then centrifuged. The resulting extract was then divided into five fractions for various analyses: 1) 

two  fractions  for  analysis  by  two  separate  reverse  phase  (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS  methods  with 

positive ion mode  electrospray ionization (ESI), 2)  one for analysis by RP/UPLC-MS/MS with 

negative ion mode ESI, 3) one for analysis by HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, 

9 

 
 
and  4)  one  reserved  for  backup.  To  remove  organic  solvent,  samples  were  briefly  placed  on  a 

TurboVap¬Æ (Zymark); samples were then stored under nitrogen overnight prior to analyses.  

Serum metabolites were quantified using Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-

Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS). All methods utilized a Waters ACQUITY UPLC 

and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a 

heated  electrospray  ionization  (HESI-II)  source  and  Orbitrap  mass  analyzer  operated  at  35,000 

mass resolution. The sample extract was dried and reconstituted in solvents compatible to each of 

the  listed  analyses.  Each  reconstitution  solvent  contained  a  series  of  standards  at  fixed 

concentrations  to  ensure  injection  and  chromatographic  consistency.  One  aliquot  was  analyzed 

using  acidic  positive  ion  conditions,  chromatographically  optimized  for  more  hydrophilic 

compounds. In this method, the extract was gradient eluted from a C18 column (Waters UPLC 

BEH C18-2.1x100 mm, 1.7 ¬µm) using water and methanol, containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic 

acid (PFPA) and 0.1% formic acid (FA). Another aliquot was also analyzed using acidic positive 

ion conditions, however it was chromatographically optimized for more hydrophobic compounds. 

In this method, the extract was gradient eluted from the same afore mentioned C18 column using 

methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05% PFPA and 0.01% FA and was operated at an overall higher 

organic content. Another aliquot was analyzed using basic negative ion optimized conditions using 

a separate dedicated C18 column. The basic extracts were gradient eluted from the column using 

methanol and water, however with 6.5mM Ammonium Bicarbonate at pH 8. The fourth aliquot 

was analyzed via negative ionization following elution from a HILIC column (Waters UPLC BEH 

Amide  2.1x150  mm,  1.7  ¬µm)  using  a  gradient  consisting  of  water  and  acetonitrile  with  10mM 

Ammonium Formate, pH 10.8. The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MSn 

10 

 
scans using dynamic exclusion. The scan range varied slighted between methods but covered 70-

1000 m/z.   

Peak analysis was conducted using a bioinformatics system which consisted of four major 

components:  1)  the  Laboratory  Information  Management  System  (LIMS  -  a  system  used  to 

automate  sample  accession  and  preparation,  instrumental  analysis  and  reporting,  and  data 

analysis),  2)  the  data  extraction  and  peak-identification  software,  3)  data  processing  tools  for 

quality control and compound identification, and 4) a collection of information interpretation and 

visualization tools.  

Raw data were extracted, peak-identified, and QC processed using Metabolon‚Äôs hardware 

and software. Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards. 

Biochemical identifications were based on three criteria: 1) retention index (RI) within a narrow 

RI window of the proposed identification, 2) accurate mass match to the library (+/- 10 ppm), and 

3) the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards. 

The MS/MS scores were based on a comparison of the ions present in the experimental spectrum 

to the  ions present in the  library spectrum.  While there may have be similarities between these 

molecules based on one of these factors, the use of all three data points was utilized to distinguish 

and differentiate more than 3,300 registered biochemicals.  

Peaks  were  quantified  using  area-under-the-curve.  A  data  normalization  step  was 

performed to correct variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences (i.e. variation 

between  pre  and  postseason  analyses).  Specifically,  each  compound  was  corrected  in  run-day 

blocks  by  registering  the  medians  to  equal  one  (1.00)  and  normalizing  each  data  point 

proportionately.  Data  were  then  log-transformed.  Of  the  3,300+  potential  biochemicals,  968 

metabolites  were  analyzed  at  Pre  and  Post  sessions.  Of  these,  161  showed  significant,  FDR-

11 

 
corrected, increases or decreases between the Pre and Post sessions (q-value < 0.05). Of those 161 

metabolites, 40 were selected based on the following criteria: 1) they appeared in the random forest 

plot  (20/40)  (see  Vike  et  al.,  2020  [84])  and  2)  they  were  hypothesized  to  change  following 

repetitive  HAEs.  Based  on  these  criteria,  six  macromolecule  categories  were  defined:  lipids 

(19/40), energy-related metabolites (5/40), xenobiotics (10/40), amino acids (3/40), carbohydrates 

(2/40), and nucleotides (1/40) [84]. These 40 metabolites were used in all subsequent analyses. 

Virtual Reality (VR) testing 

Athletes completed a previously validated Virtual Reality (VR) neurocognitive testing with 

a 3D TV system (HeadRehab.com) and a head mounted accelerometer [8,60,65,66] for Pre and 

Post sessions. The test included three modules: Spatial Memory, sensory-motor reactivity or whole 

body Reaction Time and Balance accuracy. These tasks were based on findings from [61‚Äì63] for 

spatial navigation problems following head injuries in veterans. For the Spatial Memory module 

participants were shown a randomized virtual pathway including multiple turns to a door along 

with  the  return  trip.  Athletes  were  instructed  to  repeat  the  pathway  from  their  memory  using  a 

joystick. The Spatial Memory score was based on correct responses versus the errors.  

For the Reaction Time module the participants stood feet shoulder width apart with hands 

on their hips. They were instructed to move their body in the same direction as the virtual room‚Äôs 

movements, and the accelerometer measured response time latency.  

For  the  Balance  module,  athletes  were  instructed  to  hold  a  modified  tandem  Romberg 

position for all trials. The first trial was baseline measure where the virtual room was still. Athletes 

were scored for the subsequent six trials where the virtual room moved in various directions, and 

the deviance of individual‚Äôs alignment with the virtual room was quantified via an accelerometer. 

12 

 
 
To  facilitate  interpretation,  all  scores  were  scaled  such  that  higher  score  represents  better 

performance. 

In addition to the individual scores from each module, an overall Comprehensive score was 

calculated by combining the three module scores into a ten-point scale (0 worst and 10 best) [66]. 

resting-state fMRI  

Twenty (20) athletes participated in two MRI sessions consisting of a 10-min eyes-closed 

rs-fMRI scan with echo-planar imaging and the following parameters: time of echo (TE) = 35.8 

ms, time of repetition (TR) = 2000 ms, flip angle = 90¬∞, 72 contiguous 2-mm axial slices in an 

interleaved order, voxel resolution = 2 mm √ó 2 mm √ó 2 mm, matrix size = 104 √ó 104 and 300 total 

volumes. One high-resolution T1 scan using 3D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient 

recalled  echo  (3D  MPRAGE)  sequence  was  acquired  for  registration  and  tissue  segmentation 

purposes  with  the  following  parameters:  TE  =  1.77  ms,  time  of  inversion  (TI)  =  850ms,  TR  = 

1700ms,  flip  angle  =  9¬∞,  matrix  size  =  320√ó260√ó176,  voxel  size=1mm√ó1mm√ó1mm,  receiver 

bandwidth = 300 Hz/pixel, and parallel acceleration factor = 2.  

rs-fMRI data were processed using functions from AFNI [85] and FSL [86,87] using in-

house MATLAB code explained in detail in [81]. rs-fMRI BOLD timeseries were processed in the 

subject‚Äôs native space and the first four volumes were discarded to remove spin history effects. 

Structural T1 images were denoised and segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and 

cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue masks. The 4D BOLD timeseries was then passed through outlier 

detection, despiking, slice timing correction, volume registration, aligned to the T1 structural scan, 

13 

 
 
 
voxel-wise spatial smoothing within tissue masks, scaled to a maximum (absolute value) of 200, 

and the data were censored to remove outlier timepoints (with the censoring criteria as in [81]).  

The timeseries were then detrended using no global signal regression with the following common 

regressors: (1) very low frequency fluctuations as derived from a bandpass [0.002‚Äì0.01 Hz] filter, 

the six motion parameters and their derivatives, and the voxel-wise local neighborhood (40mm) 

mean WM timeseries.  

For  connectivity  analysis  on  a  regional  basis,  the  grey  matter  brain  atlas  from  [88]  was 

warped to each subject‚Äôs native space by linear and non-linear registration. This brain parcellation 

consists of 278 regions of interest (ROIs). Note that data from the cerebellum (comprising a total 

of 30 ROIs) were discarded, because the acquired data did not completely cover this structure for 

all subjects. This resulted in a final GM partition of 248 ROIs. A functional connectivity matrix 

(namely the functional connectome; FC) was computed for each rs-fMRI scan through correlation 

of the mean time series from each of the 248 ROIs. The resulting square, symmetric FC matrices 

were not thresholded or binarized. Each FC matrix was ordered into seven cortical sub-networks, 

as  proposed  by  Yeo  et  al.  [89],  and  an  additional  eighth  sub-network  comprising  sub-cortical 

regions  was  added  [90].  These  networks  were:  Visual  (VIS),  Somato-Motor  (SM),  Dorsal 

Attention (DA), Ventral Attention (VA), Limbic System (L), Fronto-Parietal (FP), Default Mode 

Network (DMN) and subcortical regions (SUBC). The fingerprint for FC and these eight networks 

was calculated by correlating the submatrix corresponding to each of the networks from Pre and 

Post sessions [75,76,81]. The network fingerprint represents the similarity between repeat visits 

of the same participant.  

14 

 
 
Statistical Analysis 

To assess changes across the season, ‚ÄúÔÅÑ‚Äù values were calculated for all the aforementioned 

measures by subtracting Pre-session measures from Post. For rs-fMRI networks, the fingerprint‚Äî

representing the similarity between repeat visits of the same participant‚Äîwas used instead of ÔÅÑ 

values. After quality checks and removing missing data seventeen (17) subjects had both Pre and 

Post data for all five measurements.   All statistical  analyses used the software package R  [91]. 

Analyses involved identification of two-way associations, discovery of their overlap as three-way 

associations, and mediation/moderation testing within a permutation-based framework.   

Two-way associations 

Two-way associations were checked between nine network fingerprints (FC, Vis, SM, DA, 

VA, L, FP, DMN and SUBC), four  ÔÅÑVR scores (Balance, Reaction Time, Spatial Memory and 

Comprehensive), nine ÔÅÑmiRNA (miR-20a, miR-505, miR-3623p, miR-30d, miR-92a, miR-486, 

miR-92a,  miR-93p,  and  miR-151-5p),  40  ÔÅÑmetabolites  (complete  list  as  mentioned  in  [84]  and 

five HAE metrics (sessions, cHAE25G, aHAE25G, cHAE80G, and aHAE80G). Linear regression was 

run  between  two  variables  and  outliers  were  removed  based  on  Cook‚Äôs  distance  [92],  a  robust 

approach to remove outliers. After outlier removal, linear regressions were re-run and all two-way 

associations with ùëù ‚â§ 0.05 were passed forward for further analysis with three-way associations. 

For  all  two-way  associations  meeting  the  ùëù ‚â§  0.05  threshold,  we  report  the  number  of  outliers 

removed, ùëù-value, ÔÅ¢-coefficient and adjusted R2 (Radj

2 ). 

Three-way associations 

All two-way associations with ùëù ‚â§ 0.05 were used to build three-way associations.

where N is the total number of variables in matrix ùëãùë°, M and P are the total number of variables 

for matrices ùëåùë° and ùëçùë° respectively. S is the number of participants and the matrices were measured 

at two time points ùë° = 1 represents Pre and ùë° = 2 represents Post-season measurements.  

Across season measures for VR scores, miRNAs and metabolites were calculated as  

‚àÜùëã =  ùëã2 ‚àí ùëã1 

‚àÜùëå =  ùëå2 ‚àí ùëå1 

‚àÜùëç =  ùëç2 ‚àí ùëç1 

Note that, for rs-fMRI instead of difference measures network fingerprint was computed 

by correlating the data at two time-points. 

In  what  follows,  ‚àÜùíöùíã~‚àÜùíôùíä  will  be  used  to  denote  the  significant  two-way  association 

between any two variables (following the procedure described above).  

To quantify three-way associations, the following steps (A ‚Äì C, below) were performed 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
First,  two-way  associations  were  performed  between  all  variables  ‚àÜùíöùíã    and  ‚àÜùíôùíä  from 

matrices ‚àÜùëå and ‚àÜùëã: 

Step A: ‚àÜùíöùíã~‚àÜùíôùíä {

‚àÄ ùëñ ‚àà {1, ‚ãØ , ùëÅ}
‚àÄ ùëó ‚àà {1, ‚ãØ ùëÄ}

Second,  two-way  associations  were  performed  between  all  variables  ‚àÜùíõùíå  and  ‚àÜùíöùíã  from 

matrices ‚àÜùëç and ‚àÜùëå: 

Step B: ‚àÜùíõùíå~‚àÜùíöùíã {

‚àÄ ùëó ‚àà {1, ‚ãØ ùëÄ}
‚àÄ ùëò ‚àà {1, ‚ãØ ùëÉ}

Third,  two-way  associations  were  performed  between  all  variables  ‚àÜùíõùíå  and  ‚àÜùíôùíä  from 

matrices ‚àÜùëç and ‚àÜùëã: 

Step C: ‚àÜùíõùíå~‚àÜùíôùíä {

‚àÄ ùëñ ‚àà {1, ‚ãØ , ùëÅ}
‚àÄ ùëò ‚àà {1, ‚ãØ ùëÉ}

Finally, three-way associations between any three variables were formed if all three above 

steps resulted in significant two-way associations for the common variables, leading to the relation: 

‚àÜùíôùíä~‚àÜùíöùíã~‚àÜùíõùíå~‚àÜùíôùíä 

Mediation Analysis 

All three-way associations were tested for mediations with ÔÅÑVR scores as the dependent 

variable  (DV).  This  prior  hypothesis  was  observed  in  previous  studies  [60].  The  independent 

variable  (IV)  and  mediator  (M)  were  chosen  from  network  fingerprints,  ÔÅÑmiRNAs  and 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ÔÅÑmetabolites.  Please  see  the  Supplemental  material  for  a  detailed  description  of  the  mediation 

procedure.   

Moderation Analysis 

All  three-way  associations  were  also  tested  for  moderation.  The  moderation  model 

proposes that the strength and direction of the relationship between independent variable (IV) and 

dependent variable (DV) is controlled by the moderator variable (M). The IV, DV and M were 

chosen from network fingerprints, ÔÅÑmiRNAs, ÔÅÑmetabolites and ÔÅÑVR scores.  The moderation is 

characterized by the interaction term between IV and M in the linear regression equation as given 

below: 

ùê∑ùëâ =  ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1ùêºùëâ + ùõΩ2ùëÄ + ùõΩ3(ùêºùëâ ‚àó ùëÄ) + ùúñ 

Moderation is significant if  ùëùùõΩ3 ‚â§ 0.05 and ùëùùêπ ‚â§ 0.05, where ùëùùõΩ3 ‚â§ 0.05 indicates that 

ùõΩ3 is significantly different than zero using a t-test and ùëùùêπ is the ùëù-value associated with the overall 

F-test for the regression equation suggesting that the overall linear relationship is significant.  

Permutation Testing 

To  control  for  the  occurrence  of  false  positives  due  to  multiple  hypotheses  testing, 

permutation-based moderation analysis was conducted. Permutation tests re-sample observations 

from the original data multiple times to build empirical estimates of the null distribution for the 

test statistic being studied [93,94]. Permutation-based tests are especially well-suited for studies 

with small sample sizes as they estimate the statistical significance directly from the data being 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
analyzed rather than making assumptions about the underlying distribution. First, the test statistic 

is obtained from the original data set, then the data is randomly permuted multiple (Q) times and 

the test statistic is computed on each permutated data set. The statistical significance is computed 

by counting (K) the number of times the statistic value obtained in the original data set was more 

extreme than the statistic value obtained from the permuted data sets, and dividing that value by 

the number of random permutations (K/Q) [93]. 

For  this  study,  permutation-based  moderation  analysis  was  performed  for  all  three-way 

associations following the steps listed below: 

1.  Moderation analysis was performed by assigning the original data variables ‚àÜùíôùíä, ‚àÜùíöùíã, ‚àÜùíõùíå 

as IV, DV and M to obtain reference test-statistics: ùë°0 and ùêπ0. Only variables that formed 

three-way associations were considered. 

‚Ä≤
2.  Data permutation: values were randomly selected from ùíôùüè,ùíä and ùíôùüê,ùíä to assign to ùíôùüè,ùíä

 and 

‚Ä≤

3.  Across  season  measures  were  computed  from  the  permuted  dataset    ‚àÜùíôùíä

‚Ä≤ = ùíôùüê,ùíä

Similarly, ‚àÜùíöùíã

6.  ùêæ2 was incremented by one if absolute value of ùêπ0 was greater than absolute value of  ùêπùëû

7.  Steps 2-6 were repeated: ùëû = 1,2,   ‚ãØ , ùëÑ times. Here, ùëÑ = 100,000.  

19 

 
 
8.  Permutation-based p-value ùëùùõΩ3

ùëùùëíùëüùëö was calculated as the proportion of the ùë°ùëû

‚Ä≤  values that are 

as extreme or more extreme than ùë°0 i.e. ùêæ1/ùëÑ . 

9.  Permutation-based p-value ùëùùêπ

ùëùùëíùëüùëö was computed from ùêπ0 and ùêπùëû

10. Moderation analysis was considered significant if ùëùùõΩ3

Results 

This  analysis  integrated  four  types  of  measure  at  two  time-points  Pre  and  Post  from  a 

competition 

season  of  American 

collegiate 

football  using 

a  permutation-based 

mediation/moderation  framework.  The  four  measures  integrated  in  mediation/moderation  were: 

network fingerprint (reflecting changes in brain connectivity), change in metabolomics, changes 

in miRNA and changes in VR-based motor control. For such a mediation/moderation framework, 

two-way associations were identified using Cook‚Äôs distance assessments for outlier removal, and 

then  three-way  associations  were  identified  through  the  overlap  of  two-way  associations. 

Mediation testing was done in a directed manner, with motor control behavior always being the 

dependent variable following prior methods (e.g., as seen by Chen et al., 2019 [60]). Moderation 

testing looked at all possibilities for the dependent variable. All mediation/moderation testing used 

a  permutation-based  framework  to  provide  protection  against  false  positives  due  to  multiple 

comparisons. Secondary analyses done after permutation-based mediation/moderation included (i) 

assessment  of  the  brain  imaging  measures  in  athletes  relative  to  age-matched  controls,  and  (ii) 

testing of association between the four measures integrated in mediation/moderation against HAE 

measures.  

Two-way associations 

Linear  regression  following  Cook‚Äôs  outlier  removal  was  used  to  assess  significant  (ùëù  ‚â§ 

0.05) two-way associations between functional connectome (FC) and  eight network fingerprints 

(Vis, SM, DA, VA, L, FP, DMN and SUBC), four ÔÅÑVR scores (Balance, Reaction Time, Spatial 

Memory  and  Comprehensive),  nine  ÔÅÑmiRNA  (miR-20a,  miR-505,  miR-3623p,  miR-30d,  miR-

92a, miR-486, miR-92a, miR-93p, and miR-151-5p), 40 ÔÅÑmetabolites (complete list as mentioned 

21 

 
 
in [84]. Secondary analyses included assessments of these four categories of measure against the 

five HAE metrics (sessions, cHAE25G, aHAE25G, cHAE80G, and aHAE80G). 

Supplemental Table 1 (A-J) report the significant negative or positive pairwise associations 

between any two variables with number of Cook‚Äôs outliers removed, ùëù-value, ÔÅ¢ coefficient and 

adjusted  R2 (Radj

2 )  for  the  regression.  The  common  significant  pairwise  associations  were  then 

used to build three-way associations.  

Three-way associations 

Three-way associations were formed from the common significant pairwise associations 

between any three variables ‚àÜùíôùíä, ‚àÜùíöùíã and ‚àÜùíõùíå where these could be any of the network fingerprints, 

ÔÅÑVR scores, ÔÅÑmiRNAs and/or ÔÅÑmetabolites (see Methods for details).  

Table  1  (A-C)  lists  all  three-way  associations  that  resulted  from  the  common  pairwise 

associations  as  described  in  Methods,  and  were  used  for  directed  mediation  and  moderation 

analysis. 

Mediation and Moderation results 

The three-way associations were tested for directed mediation analysis with  ÔÅÑVR as the 

dependent variable. The independent variable and mediator were chosen from network fingerprint, 

ÔÅÑmiRNA  and/or  ÔÅÑmetabolite.  None  of  the  three-way  associations  resulted  in  a  significant 

mediation.  

The  three-way  associations  identified  and  listed  in  Table  1  (A-C)  were  then  tested  for 

moderation analysis across network fingerprint, ÔÅÑVR, ÔÅÑmetabolite and ÔÅÑmiRNA. Table 1 (A-C)

There  was  a  negative  relationship  between  DMN  fingerprint  and  ÔÅÑtridecenedioate,  a  negative

rs-fMRI between Age-Matched Non-Athletes (NAth) and Football Athletes (Ath) 

To  facilitate  interpretation  of  the  permutation-based  mediation/moderation  analyses, 

network fingerprint strength was compared between age-match non-athletes (NAth) and football 

athletes (Ath) in this study.

cohort  for  NAth  and  Ath.  The  NAth  exhibited  stronger  fingerprint  for  each  of  the  resting-state

the  network  fingerprints  for  age-match  non-athletes  and  football  athletes.  Age-matched  non-

athletes  exhibited  significantly  higher  network  fingerprint  values,  using  two-sample  t-test 

following Bonferroni correction, for all networks except the Limbic system (L), as compared to 

the football athletes.

Discussion 

This study evaluated the hypothesis that omic measures from the transcriptome (miRNA) 

and metabolome (individualized biochemistry) would mediate or moderate the relationship of rs-

fMRI measures to motor control behavior collected Pre and Post season in collegiate American 

football athletes. Using a rigorous outlier removal procedure and permutation analyses for multiple 

comparisons  correction,  this  hypothesis  was  confirmed  for  one  metabolomic  measure  showing 

multiple moderation effects. Specifically, a fatty acid, tridecenedioate, was found to moderate the 

relationship of the DMN fingerprint from rs-fMRI to motor control (balance) behavior. The DMN 

network was shown to have less self-similarity over the course of the season in football players 

relative to age-matched controls, and it showed a negative relationship with HAEs accumulated 

over  the  season  (i.e.,  more  HAEs  meant  lower  similarity  in  DMN  across  the  season).  Further, 

HAEs showed a positive association with changes in miR-505 levels, indicating that increasing 

HAEs were associated with increasing levels of a neuroinflammatory-associated miRNA. Lastly, 

tridecenedioate moderated the relationship of miR-505 to the DMN network.  

Tridecenedioate is a long-chain monounsaturated (i.e., one double bond) dicarboxylic fatty 

acid. Such compounds are hypothesized to act as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers given 

the  double  bond  stability  and  reactivity.  Interestingly,  similar  monounsaturated  compounds,  as 

observed  [84],  were  also  decreased  (e.g.,  heptenedioate,  hexedecenedioate).  Long-chain 

polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have anti-inflammatory properties via the reduction of ROS 

and  direct  superoxide  scavenging  [95],  while  monounsaturated  fatty  acids  (MUFAs)  display 

neuroprotective effects and ameliorate brain  injury in animal models [96]. Unsaturated FAs are 

also shown to efficiently antagonize the toxic action of saturated non-esterified fatty acids [97], 

and  the  presence  of  the  double  bond  corresponds  to  increased  antioxidant  and  neuroprotective 

30 

 
effects  [98].  Thus,  the  association  between  across-season  decreases  in  tridecenedioate  with 

inflammatory  miR-505  (see  Supplemental  Figure1)  implicate  its  role  in  ROS  scavenging  and 

inflammation resolution.  

Overall, the selected miRNAs have been implicated in cancer, systemic inflammation, and 

central  nervous  system  disorders  [99‚Äì107].  Specifically,  miR-505  is  negatively  correlated  with 

progression  in  various  cancers,  inhibiting  tumorigenesis  and  acting  as  a  tumor  suppressor  in 

malignancies such as glioblastoma, endometrial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate 

cancer  [108‚Äì111].  In  osteosarcoma  tissues,  for  instance,  the  reduced  expression  of  miR-505  is 

significantly associated with poorer clinical prognosis [112]. miR-505 has been reported to inhibit 

osteosarcoma  and  hepatoma  cell  proliferation,  migration  and  invasion  by  regulating  the  high-

mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern that 

propagates  infection-  or  injury-elicited  inflammatory  responses  [112,113].  In  addition  to  its 

oncogenic  associations,  miR-505  was  found  to  be  significantly  decreased  in  the  blood  of 

Ulcerative  Colitis  patients,  thus  playing  a  critical  role  in  chronic  inflammatory  bowel  disease 

[114]. Furthermore, miR-505 has been implicated in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease [115] and identified as a 

predictive  biomarker  for  Parkinson‚Äôs  disease  (PD)  [116].  In  PD,  miR-505  had  a  potential 

functional  role  via  inverse  modulation  of  neural  proliferation  differentiation  and  control  1 

(NPDC1),  a  down-regulator  of  neural  proliferation  [117].  miR-505  was  also  shown  to  be 

upregulated in both mild to moderate and severe TBI in human subjects [46]. Here, involvement 

of  miR-505  suggests  a  state  of  neuroinflammation  in  asymptomatic  football  athletes  due  to 

repetitive HAE exposure.  miR-505 was not only associated with decreased tridecenedioate, but 

also with decreased self-identifiability in the DMN. 

31 

 
Default  Mode  Network  (DMN)  is  the  resting  state  fMRI  network  that  appeared  in  both 

moderation results. Alterations in this network have been associated with numerous neurological 

disorders. DMN, an ensemble of cortical regions, typically including parts of the anterior and the 

posterior cingulate cortices, is a task-negative resting state network that is active while at rest and 

deactivated during a task. Apart from being active during rest, DMN persists in passive sensory 

processing tasks with minimal cognitive demands [70,118,119] but switches off during externally 

cued tasks with high cognitive demands. DMN is essential for basic, and possibly subconscious, 

processing necessary for calibrating affective and autonomic states of the brain [70]. DMN is also 

critical for retrieval of episodic memory [70,120‚Äì123] and altered connectivity has been observed 

in patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease [70,124‚Äì128]. Altered DMN connectivity, and the subsequent 

inability to deactivate it for cognitive tasks, has also been observed in patients with schizophrenia 

[129,130], depression [131‚Äì133], epilepsy [134‚Äì136], multiple sclerosis [137], Autism Spectrum 

Disorder [138] and contributes to executive deficits in Parkinson Disease (PD) patients [139] such 

as  PD-associated  saccadic  hypometria  [140]  and  altered  resistance  to  passive  movement/motor 

performance  in  PD  patients  [141,142].  Altered  DMN  connectivity  has  also  been  observed  in 

concussed  and  TBI  patients  [12,143‚Äì151].  Despite  these  profound  network  changes,  relating 

complex neuroimaging such as rs-fMRI to observable behavior remains elusive. 

Core  features  of  the  diagnosis  of  concussion  and  accumulated  HAEs  over  a  season,  are 

disturbances of motor control in the form of coordination, balance, or the capacity to navigate as 

investigated by Alexander Luria [61‚Äì63]. Numerous studies have attempted to uncover behavioral 

changes in contact sport athletes, but many tests are insensitive to subtle changes in behavior [152‚Äì

156]. Recent advances in virtual reality (VR) has prompted the investigation of these deficits in 

concussed  athletes  with  the  use  of  a  validated  methodology  [64,65].  In  order  to  observe  subtle 

32 

 
changes in contact sports athletes with or without concussion, it is critical to study associations 

between motor control behavior and other measures, such as metabolomics and brain imaging.  In 

this study, changes in VR Balance scores over the season were found to be associated with DMN 

fingerprint and ÔÅÑtridecenedioate. Better performance in the VR Balance task was related to higher 

DMN  similarity  (i.e.,  higher  fingerprint  values)  over  the  season  and  lower  levels  of  the  ROS 

scavenging  compound,  tridecenedioate.  This  implied  that  improved  motor  control  across  the 

season of play was associated with smaller changes in  the brain‚Äôs executive network and  more 

efficient neuroinflammation resolution. Combining complex computational VR tasks with other 

indicators  of  neurological  dysfunction  (i.e.,  metabolomics  and  neuroimaging)  proved  to  be  a 

powerful  method  to  uncover  subtle,  and  unobservable  changes  in  brain  function  related  to 

repetitive HAEs. 

DMN fingerprint and ÔÅÑmiR-505 were also found to be correlated with the HAE metrics. 

First, the DMN fingerprint, which depicts similarity between repeat visits for a specific participant, 

was found to be significantly lower in football athletes as compared to age-matched non-athletes. 

This implies that the DMN network, which is critical for executive functions, is altered in football 

athletes.  Specifically,  the  fingerprint  was  negatively  associated  with  the  cumulative  number  of 

high magnitudes hits; namely, the higher the number of cHAE80G, the lower the similarity in DMN 

across  the  season.  Second,  ÔÅÑmiR-505  was  found  to  be  positively  associated  with  aHAE25; 

therefore,  elevated  levels  of  an  inflammatory  miRNA  were  positively  associated  with  a  higher 

number of average HAEs over the season. One interpretation of these results is that limiting HAE 

exposure over the season could potentially mitigate the alterations observed in these asymptomatic 

athletes.  

33 

 
The primary limitation of the study was the modest sample size for which all five measures 

were available: transcriptome, metabolome, MR imaging, VR behavior, and HAE data. It is critical 

to  note  that  with  the  highly  rigorous  mathematical  approach  used  in  this  study  to  analyze  the 

dataset, results are deemed highly reproducible despite this potential limitation. Another potential 

limitation of the study was that the HAE metrics were only allowed to be collected at practices and 

not  during  competitive  play,  which  resulted  in  a  limited  picture  of  the  true  exposure  to 

‚Äúsubconcussive‚Äù  events.  To  observe  the  transient  changes  that  football  athletes  go  through 

throughout a competition season, these metrics would need to be collected over more impact events 

in  future  studies.  Future  studies  might  also  include  comparison  of  the  aforementioned  metrics 

collected for football athletes to age-matched, non-contact sports athletes.   

Conclusion 

This study evaluated the associations between metabolome, transcriptome, brain imaging, 

and behavior measures, collected in collegiate football athletes before and after the season, as a 

function of mechanical accelerations to the head. It was found that ÔÅÑtridecenedioate moderated the 

relationship between 1) ÔÅÑmiR-505 and DMN fingerprint and 2) the relationship between DMN 

fingerprint and ÔÅÑVR Balance measures. Metabolomics provides a viable method for investigating 

metabolic fluctuations and biomarkers of brain injury [157,158], but often lack a relationship to 

neurological function or dysfunction (observed with brain imaging or behavioral testing) and other 

markers  of  neuroinflammation  (i.e.  miRNAs).  Here,  a  metabolomic  measure  was  found  to  be 

associated with the transcriptome, brain imaging, and behavior, elucidating it as a potential HAE-

associated  blood  biomarker  of  neurological  dysfunction.  The  integration  of  these  multi-scale 

biological  measures  through a permutation-based approach uncovered a mechanism of putative 

34 

 
 
brain injury due to HAEs as summarized in Figure 4 and described in detail in [84]. The findings 

of  this  study  are  synergistic  with  the  findings  of  Vike  and  colleagues  in  that  markers  of 

mitochondrial distress were linked to HAEs, and metabolites related to fatty acid oxidation (e.g. 

sebacate)  and  the  TCA  cycle  (e.g.  citrate)  were  observed  to  mediate  the  relationship  between 

miRNAs and behavior [84]. Mitochondrial dysfunction is suspected to increase reactive oxygen 

species  production,  which  is  supported  by  the  alterations  we  observed  with  ÔÅÑtridecenedioate, 

which was in turn linked to chronic elevations in inflammatory miRNAs and alterations in brain 

imaging  and  behavior.    The  rigorous  permutation-based  mediation/moderation  that  integrated 

omic measures with brain imaging and behavior suggests a viable methodology for investigating 

complex multi-scale biological data. Altogether, this study suggests 1) a potential mechanism of 

brain injury due to repetitive HAEs and 2) a permutation-based mediation/ moderation approach 

to integrate multi-scale data  that can be applied broadly. This last point is of importance in the 

context of current controversies about the relevance of animal models of functional brain illness, 

such as with mental illness, and suggests one possible route forward for developing mechanistic 

hypotheses from the study of humans alone [159‚Äì165]. 

35 

 
Figure 4. Synopsis figure summarizing the interplay between moderation variables. Repetitive head accelerate events 
(HAEs) in football athletes have been related to changes in brain homeostasis, as evidenced by neuroimaging studies 
[9,11‚Äì16,19]. Additionally, a study using the same collegiate football dataset [84] pointed to mitochondrial distress 
and  subsequent  energy  imbalance,  as  evidenced  by  increased  medium-chain  fatty  acids  and  decreased  TCA 
metabolites. Furthermore, the metabolites were observed to mediate the relationship between elevated miRNAs and 
Luria behavior. In the present study, significant moderation effects were observed with default mode network (DMN) 
fingerprint, miR-505, VR balance task performance, and tridecenedioate. Tridecenedioate, a dicarboxylic fatty acid 
with  one  double  bond,  significantly  decreased  from  pre-  to  post-season.  The  double  bond  in  this  metabolite  is 
hypothesized to act as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Indeed, previous research supports an increase in 
reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  following  repetitive  exposure  to  head  impacts  [166];  therefore,  a  depletion  of 
tridecenedioate would support its role as an ROS scavenger. Even with scavenging, ROS can still remain elevated and 
cause damage to neurophysiological systems [166]. This may ultimately result in damage to neuronal connectivity as 
observed  by  decreased  similarity  in  DMN  and  interactions  with  VR  balance  task  performance.  Together,  these 
complex relationships may explain why behavioral changes in subconcussed athletes are not consistently observed, 
but how repetitive, long-term exposure to HAEs, chronic increases of inflammatory-miRNAs, and acute changes to 
resting state networks could result in behavioral disturbances later in life

Age Matched Non-Athletes (NAth) 

A  cohort  of  sixteen  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  (age:  mean  ¬±  st.  deviation  = 

22.8¬± 2.12 years; nine female and seven male) from Purdue University participated in imaging 

session and served as Age Matched Non-Athletes (NAth) for this study.  

The imaging session conducted using a 3T General Electric Signa HDx and a 16- channel 

brain  array  (Nova  Medical)  consisted  of  high  resolution  T1  scan  and  a  ten  minutes  eyes-open 

resting-state  fMRI  scan.  The  imaging  parameters  for  rs-fMRI  consisted  of  blipped  echo-planar 

imaging: TR/TE = 2000/26 msec; flip angle = 35ÔÇ∞; 34 slices; acceleration factor = 2; Field of View 

= 20 cm; voxel size = 3.125 x 3.125 x 3.80 mm and 294 volumes. The details of this imaging data 

are  described  in  Bari  et  al.,  2019  [81].  This  dataset  was  processed  using  the  steps  listed  in  the 

Methods  section  and  as  described  in  [81].  Network  fingerprint  comparisons  were  conducted 

between  age-matched  non-athletes  and  football  athletes  using  two-sample  t-test  following 

Bonferroni correction, 

Permutation-based Mediation Analysis  

Mediation seeks to clarify the causal relationship between the independent variable (IV) 

and dependent variable (DV) with the inclusion of a third variable mediator (M). Mediation model 

proposes that instead of a direct causal relationship between IV and DV, the IV influences M which 

then  influences  the  DV.  Beta  coefficients  (Œ≤)  and  standard  error  (se)  terms  from  the  following 

linear regression equations are used to calculate the Sobel p-value and mediation effect percentage 

(Teff) using the following steps:

                         ùëÜùë°ùëíùëù 4 (ùëÉùëéùë°‚Ñé ùê∂,  ùëöùëúùëëùëíùëô 2):  ùê∑ùëâ =  ùõΩ0 +  ùõΩ1,2ùê∂(ùêºùëâ) +  ùõΩ2,2ùê∂(ùëÄ) + ùúñ2ùê∂  

Sobel‚Äôs test is used to test if ùõΩ1,2ùê∂ was significantly lower than ùõΩ1,1ùê∂ using the following equation:

Using  a  standard  2-tail  z-score  table,  the  Sobel  p-value  is  determined  from  Sobel  z-score. 

Mediation effect percentage Teff  is calculated using the following equation:

For this study, permutation-based mediation analysis was performed for all three-way associations 

following the steps listed below:
