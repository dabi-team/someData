Variable-Rate M-PSK Communications

without Channel Amplitude Estimation

Abstract

Channel estimation at the receiver side is essential to adaptive modulation schemes, prohibiting

low complexity systems from using variable rate and/or variable power transmissions. Towards

providing a solution to this problem, we introduce a variable-rate (VR) M-PSK modulation scheme,

for communications over fading channels, in the absence of channel gain estimation at the receiver.

The choice of the constellation size is based on the signal-plus-noise (S+N) sampling value rather

than on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). It is analytically shown that S+N can serve as an excellent

simpler criterion, alternative to S/N, for determining the modulation order in VR systems. In this way,

low complexity transceivers can use VR transmissions in order to increase their spectral efﬁciency

under an error performance constraint. As an application, we utilize the proposed VR modulation

scheme in equal gain combining (EGC) diversity receivers.

I. INTRODUCTION

A common technique for coping with fading in wireless communications, is transmission or

reception diversity, which provides performance improvement at the cost of extra hardware or

increased bandwidth usage. Alternatively, if a feedback link is available, the fading can be mitigated

by allowing the receiver to monitor the channel conditions and request compensatory changes in

certain parameters of the transmitted signal. This technique is called adaptive transmission and

its basic concept is the real-time balancing of the link budget through adaptive variation of the

transmitted power level, symbol transmission rate, constellation size, coding rate/scheme, or any

combination of these parameters.

Adapting to the signal fading allows the channel to be used more efﬁciently since power and

rate can be allocated to take advantage of favorable channel conditions. Adaptive transmission was

ﬁrst proposed by Hayes [1], who considered a Rayleigh fading channel where the amplitude of the

transmitted signal is under control of the receiver through a feedback channel.

A. Motivation

Several works have dealed with adaptive transmission systems, in which the modulation/coding

parameters, such as constellation size and coding rate are adaptively varied with the prevailing

fading channel condition while maintaining a certain error rate performance [2]-[9]. These techniques

have been also considered in several modern terrestrial and satellite communication systems, also

incorporated in standards (e.g. High-Speed Downlink Packet Access - HSDPA [12] and Digital Video

Broadcasting - Return Channel via Satellite - DVB-RCS [13]).

In many practical applications, the adaptive transmission is limited to variable-rate (VR) schemes,

since the difference from variable-power (VP) VR, is a small fraction of decibel for most types of

fading [4]. Most of the VR communication systems proposed in the literature, adapt the transmission

parameters according to the instantaneous channel condition, limiting their applicability to systems

that estimate the instantaneous channel gain, either perfectly or with estimation errors.

B. Previous Works and Contribution

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no VR modulation scheme has been proposed in the literature

that does not require channel gain estimation, neither at the receiver, nor at the transmitter. In [14],

the performance of a blind adaptive modulation scheme is investigated, which necessitates channel

knowledge only at the receiver. In this scheme, the order of an M-ary quadrature amplitude modula-

tion (M-QAM) sequentially decreases or increases according to positive/negative acknowledgments

(ACK/NACK) sent to the transmitter.

In this paper, we propose a rate adaptation technique, which is based on the signal-plus-noise (S+N)

samples, instead of the instantaneous S/N. Owing to this particularity, no channel gain estimation is

necessary for determining the transmission rate.

The S+N technique has been applied to selection diversity communication systems (e.g. see [15]

and the references therein), where its main advantage lies in taking into account the instantaneous

noise power, in contrast to S/N (e.g. the channel gain divided by the average noise power). The main

contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows.

•

•

We analytically show that S+N can serve as an excellent alternative criterion to S/N, in VR

systems; the same spectral efﬁciency can be achieved, when either S/N or S+N is used for

determining the constellation size.

Based on this important outcome, we introduce an S+N-based VR M-ary phase shift keying

(M-PSK) modulation scheme that does not require any channel gain estimation. Note, that M-

PSK modulation schemes have some important advantages over QAM schemes, e.g. improved

performance when used with high power ampliﬁers (HPA). Another advantage of using M-PSK

instead of M-QAM for Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems is the

availability of techniques to reduce the signal’s Peak-to-Average-power Ratio (PAR), also known

as PAPR or PMEPR (Peak-to-Mean Envelope Power Ratio) [16].

C. Outline

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the S+N based adaptation scheme

is presented and compared with the S/N one. Two criteria are applied for evaluating the efﬁciency

of the S+N scheme. The VR M-PSK modulation scheme is presented in Section III, along with an

application to EGC receivers. Section IV discusses some numerical results. Concluding remarks are

given in Section V.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND VR SCHEMES

We consider a discrete-time channel, assuming that the fading amplitude a[i] follows a Rayleigh

distribution with probability density function (pdf)

fa(a) =

(1)

where Ω = E

. The channel gain is assumed to be the same between two symbol intervals. The

instantaneous received signal is
(cid:8)

(cid:9)

r[i] = a[i]ejϑ[i]s[i] + n[i],

(2)

where s[i] is the complex transmitted symbol, ϑ[i] is the phase introduced by the fading channel and

n[i] is a zero mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian noise with E

n[i]∗n[i]
}
{

= N0 = 2σ2.

The symbol s[i] is selected from a signal constellation with M symbols (e.g. M-QAM or M-PSK)

each with energy ESk and total average symbol energy, ES = 1. Then, the received S/N will be

γ[i] = ES

a2[i]
BN0

,

(3)

where B is the bandwidth of the received signal. The average channel gain is denoted as γ, which

is assumed to be γ = 1, without loss of the generality.

A. S/N-based VR Systems

In conventional VR systems, the modulation order used at the time instant i + 1, is determined

by the value of the received S/N, γ[i], at the time instant i, and a predetermined symbol or bit error

rate (SER or BER) target. The objective is to maximize the spectral efﬁciency by using the largest

possible constellation size for transmission under the instantaneous error rate requirement. Towards

this aim, a mathematical formulation that relates the SER, PS, with the modulation order, M , and

the received S/N, γ[i], are necessary. This formulation must be simple enough, so that M can be

directly expressed as a function of PS and γ[i], i.e.,

PS = G (γ[i], M )

⇐⇒

M = f (γ[i], PS)

or γ[i] = V (M , PS)

(4)

In the following, the time notation, i, will be omitted.

Given a direct relation between M and γ, at each symbol time, the constellation order, M, is
M1, M2, M3, M4, . . . , MN }

selected from N available ones, i.e.,
f (γ, PS) lies; the modulation order will be equal to Mj, if Mj ≤

M < Mj+1, with j = 1, ...,

N and MN +1 =

∞

. Because of the relation between M , γ and PS, the constellation size can be

equivalently determined by γ, after discretizing the range of channel fade levels. Speciﬁcally, the

range of γ is divided into N + 1 fading regions [γj, γj+1], and the constellation Mj is associated

with the jth region.

In summary, the modulation order is determined as

M = Mj,

In the proposed S+N scheme, the modulation order is chosen similarly to the conventional one,

with the difference that γ is replaced by ξ, i.e. the selected order, M , will be

The effectiveness of the proposed scheme will be compared against the conventional one by

considering the S/N as the reference criterion for determining the maximum modulation order. The

question that has to be answered is how would the choice of the modulation order of a VR system

be affected by utilizing the S+N instead of the S/N.

In the following, assuming constant energy transmissions, the answer will be given through the

calculation of two speciﬁc probabilities-criteria, which eventually quantify the similarity between

S+N and S/N.

Criterion 1: The probability that both S/N and S+N determine the same constellation size, i.e.,

As a general comment regarding criterion 1, one can observe that Π1 may not be always indicative

of the efﬁciency of S+N to replace S/N, since it involves also the probability that S/N leads to a

modulation order, M . In other words, if the probability that S/N leads to the modulation order, Mj,

is too low, then Π1 will be also too low, independently of whether S+N led to the same order, Mj or

not. Towards this, a supplemental criterion for the efﬁciency of S+N is presented in the following.

November 23, 2018

Criterion 2: The probability that the constellation size, determined by S+N, is M, given that the

constellation size, determined by S/N is also M, , i.e.,

Π2 = Pr

Compared to criterion 1, one can observe that this criterion quantiﬁes more efﬁciently the ability of

S+N to stand in for S/N, since it takes into account the fact that S/N has led to a speciﬁc modulation

order, Mj, and not the probability to lead to that speciﬁc order.

The probability in (21), can be calculated as in (17), but now, the random variable, y, is limited

inside the interval [

N0 γj,

N0γj+1]. This is implied by the fact that the probability

Therefore, an approximate solution to (21) can be obtained by ”forcing” the pdf, fy(y), to have

A. Mode of Operation

III. VARIABLE RATE M-PSK

In this section, we introduce a constant power, VR M-PSK modulation scheme, in which the

decision on the modulation order is not based on the S/N samples, but rather on the S+N ones.

The mode of operation is illustrated in Fig. 1. An ideal coherent phase detection is assumed to be

available at the receiver at time instant, i, while no channel gain estimation is necessary. The receiver

estimates the S+N samples at time, i, and decides on the constellation size Mj = 2j, j = 1, 2, . . . ,

N, that will be used at the next time interval, i + 1, according to this sample. The decision on the

modulation order is sent back to the transmitter, transmitting N bits through a feedback channel,

that does not introduce any errors, which can be assured by increasing its delay time and using an

ARQ transmission protocol.

As mentioned, the estimation of the modulation order requires a closed-form formula that relates,

the S/N with the error probability. For the case of the M-PSK we can use the approximation for the

SER, i.e., [17, Ch. 7]

The proposed scheme gives the ability to communications systems with no channel gain estimation

capabilities to adapt their transmission rate, so that their spectral efﬁciency can be increased. We

should also note that in some applications, constant envelope modulations, such as M-PSK, are more

desirable that other ones, because of speciﬁc advantages (e.g. their improved performance when used

with high power ampliﬁers).

For the case of the S+N, however, a similar approach cannot be followed, since a formula for

the SER as a function of ξ is required. Moreover, when physically realizing S+N schemes, though,

by sampling the output of a matched ﬁlter, the noise is a random variable [22]. Thus, it is inexact

to specify the performance of S+N systems using a constant noise analysis. Because of the above

reasons, the SER for the proposed scheme is calculated via computer simulations.

Assuming that the random phase ϑk[i] are known at the receiver, the received signals are co-phased

and transferred to baseband so that the signal at the kth branch will be

ak[i]s(t) + nk[i]ejϑk[i]

, k = 1. . . . L.

(41)

uk[i] =

ℜ

n

o

At the combination stage the signals uk[i] are weighted and summed to produce the decision variable

L

u[i] =

wk[i]uk[i]

(42)

where wk[i] is the weight of the kth branch. Then, applying Maximum Likelihood Detection (MLD),

Xk=1

the combiner’s output is compared with all the known possible transmitted symbols in order to extract

the decision metric.

The coherent equal-gain-combining (EGC) receiver [21, Ch. 9.3] cophases and equally weights

each branch before combining and therefore does not require estimation of the channel (path) fading

amplitudes, but only knowledge of the channel phase, in order the demodulator to undo the random

phase shifts introduced on the diversity channels.

As a result, for wk[i] = 1, the output combined signal will be

L

u[i] =

uk[i]

(43)

Xk=1
which is actually the summation of the S+N at each diversity branch. As a result, the VR M-PSK

modulation scheme can be directly applied to EGC receivers with the decision on the modulation

order to be based on

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The evaluation of the probabilities, Π1 and Π2 is very important, since they imply the efﬁciency

of S+N to estimate the quality of the instantaneous received signal. For the case of the M-PSK, Π1

and Π2 are plotted in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively. Note, that the simulation results coincide perfectly

with the analytical ones, for both these probabilities.

A general conclusion derived form these ﬁgures is that if the S/N based VR M-PSK uses a speciﬁc

modulation order, the probability that the S+N based VR M-PSK uses the same order is relatively

high. Moreover, as expected, the efﬁciency of the S+N improves as the average S/N increases, since

the instantaneous noise components become small, so that the divergence between (a√ES + n)2 and
a2ES decreases.

The difference between the S/N and S+N based VR M-PSK schemes in terms of spectral efﬁciency

is shown in Fig. 5. It is seen that both schemes achieve the same spectral efﬁciency, while the

difference in their SER is not signiﬁcant as indicated in Fig. 6. In the latter ﬁgure, the SER of the

ﬁxed-rate M-PSKis also depicted for comparison reasons. In general, it can be observed that the S+N

can serve as an attractive criterion for determining the channel quality, when channel gain estimation

is not available.

The explanation for the efﬁciency of the S+N criterion is as follows: in the conventional VR

M-PSK, the decision on the modulation order is based on the instantaneous S/N, i.e. on a2ES/N0,

which means that the instantaneous noise power is ignored, since only the average noise power is

taken into account. On the contrary, the S+N samples, (a√ES + n)2 include the instantaneous noise

component and therefore an indirect estimation of the instantaneous noise power is obtained.

Similar results can be obtained also for the EGC employing VR M-PSK. As shown in Fig.7, the

spectral efﬁciency is increased compared to a ﬁxed rate M-PSK scheme, while the SER is maintained

under the required levels, whenever this is possible. It should be noted that in some cases the SEP

may be greater than the desired target. For example, in Fig. 8, for L = 4, we observe that the SEP

could be lower than 10−

3 for SNR ¿ 5 dB, by employing BPSK, while with the VR MPSK scheme

the SEP becomes lower than 10−

3, for SNR ¿ 7 dB.

V. CONCLUSIONS

A VR M-PSK modulation scheme was introduced for wireless communication systems, where

channel gain estimation is not available. VR M-PSK requires no channel gain estimation and in-

creases the spectral efﬁciency of M-PSK systems under the instantaneous error rate requirement.

The choice of the modulation order is not based on the S/N samples, but rather on the S/N ones.

It was analytically shown that the S+N criterion is an attractive alternative to S/N for choosing the

appropriate modulation order in VR communication systems, since the same spectral efﬁciency can

be achieved, when either S/N or S+N is used. Moreover, the proposed adaptive modulation scheme

was applied to EGC receivers, enabling low-complexity diversity systems to increase their spectral

efﬁciency.
