Abstract—Recently, reconﬁgurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)
have drawn intensive attention to enhance the coverage of
millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems. However,
existing works mainly consider the RIS as a whole uniform
plane, which may be unrealistic to be installed on the facade
of buildings when the RIS is extreme large. To address this
problem, in this paper, we propose a sparse array of sub-surface
(SAoS) architecture for RIS, which contains several rectangle
shaped sub-surfaces termed as RIS tiles that can be sparsely
deployed. An approximated ergodic spectral efﬁciency of the
SAoS aided system is derived and the performance impact
of the SAoS design is evaluated. Based on the approximated
ergodic spectral efﬁciency, we obtain an optimal reﬂection
coefﬁcient design for each RIS tile. Analytical results show
that the received signal-to-noise ratios can grow quadratically
and linearly to the number of RIS elements under strong and
weak LoS scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the
visible region (VR) phenomenon in the SAoS aided mmWave
system and ﬁnd that the optimal distance between RIS tiles
is supposed to yield a total SAoS VR nearly covering the
whole blind coverage area. The numerical results verify the
tightness of the approximated ergodic spectral efﬁciency and
demonstrate the great system performance.

I. INTRODUCTION

As a promising technology for future wireless com-
munication systems, millimeter wave (mmWave) commu-
nication can support giga-bit-per-second data rates since
there are abundant of bandwidth available at mmWave
frequency spectrum [1]. Although the directional transmis-
sion property of mmWave massive multiple-input-multiple-
output (MIMO) can compensate the severe propagation loss
, which is brought by the high operating frequency, this
highly directional transmission also makes the mmWave
communication link more susceptible to the blockage [2][3].
Therefore, how to enhance the coverage and improve the
anti-blockage ability of mmWave communication systems,
is an important issue that is worth studying.

Reconﬁgurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are an emerging
technology with promising potential of constructing smart
radio environment [4]. By exploring the properties of meta-
surface, RISs can manipulate the phase of the incident

electromagnetic wave and reﬂect it to the desired direction.
Therefore, we can exploit RISs to provide an artiﬁcial
communication link to users in the blind coverage area.
Recently, researches [5]-[9] focused on RIS are springing up.
Considering single-user scenario, [5] evaluated the downlink
performance of a RIS-assisted large-scale antenna system
by formulating a tight upper bound of ergodic spectral
efﬁciency. Aiming at maximizing the energy efﬁciency in
downlink multi-user communication, the authors in [6] pro-
posed two effective approaches to tackle the non-convex
optimization problems by means of designing both the
transmit power allocation and the RIS phase shifts. By
jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the base station
(BS) and the passive beamforming at the RIS, the maximal
received signal power for a single-antenna user, the maximal
sum rate and weighted sum rate for multiple users were
investigated in [7], [8] and [9], respectively.

However, the aforementioned works all consider the RIS
as a whole uniform plane. In practical, RISs are supposed
to be deployed on the facade of the building, which, unfor-
tunately, means that a whole compact large-scale RIS plane
will be unrealistic, since the facade of buildings has their
own functional requirement such as, daylighting, commercial
advertisement display with digital screen, and so on.

To solve this problem, in this paper, a sparse array of sub-
surface (SAoS)-based architecture is proposed for the RIS
to assist the mmWave communication system. In SAoS, the
RIS is divided into several rectangle-shaped sub-surfaces .
Each of these sub-surfaces is termed as an RIS tile and
can be sparsely deployed. Meanwhile, visible region (VR) is
also considered in each RIS tile given by the large effective
antenna array aperture. To investigate the beneﬁts of the
SAoS1, we ﬁrst derive a tight approximation for the ergodic
system spectral efﬁciency. Then, based on the approximated
ergodic spectral efﬁciency, the optimal reﬂection coefﬁcients
of SAoS are obtained. The analytical results show that
the received SNR can grow quadratically to the element
number of SAoS when strong line-of-sight (LoS) paths exist
between both BS-SAoS channels and mobile station (MS)-
SAoS channels. When LoS paths are absent either between
BS-SAoS channels or MS-SAoS channels, the received SNR
grows linearly to the element number of SAoS. Numerical
results validate the tightness of the approximated ergodic

based RIS.

 
 
 
 
 
 
spectral efﬁcieny and demonstrate the signiﬁcant perfor-
mance gain acquired by the optimal reﬂection coefﬁcient
design. The scaling law under different Rician factor is also
investigated. Moreover, it is found that when the distance
between RIS tiles is designed to maximize the ergodic
system spectral efﬁciency, the total VR of the SAoS nearly
covers the whole blind coverage area.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider a SAoS-aided mmWave uplink communica-
tion system, as shown in Fig. 1. A single-antenna MS is
located in the blind coverage area and cannot directly com-
municate with the BS. To deal with the blockage problem,
the SAoS, acting as an anomalous mirror, is deployed on a
two dimensional facade of a building which is in the line of
sight of the BS. The BS is equipped with a uniform planar
NB,h antennas, and the
array (UPA) with NB = NB,v ×
vertical and horizontal spacing between adjacent antennas
is half carrier wavelength. We deﬁne each rectangle-shaped
sub-surface as an RIS tile, as shown in Fig.1. The SAoS
contains ML = ML,v ×
ML,h RIS tiles with adjacent vertical
and horizontal distance being dL,v and dL,h, respectively. For
NL,h RIS elements
each RIS tile, there are NL = NL,v ×
spacing ∆L,v and ∆L,h in the vertical and horizontal axis,
respectively. The RIS elements are controlled by the BS
via an RIS controller and can be equivalently regarded as
phase shifters which can manipulate the phase of the incident
signal. Note that the SAoS is deployed close to the blocked
MS but away from the BS.

A. Channel Model

Since the distance from the SAoS to the BS is far enough,
the widely used Saleh-Valenzuela geometric model [10][11]
can be adopted to describe the channel between the BS and
RIS tiles. With Rician factor KB denoting the ratio between
the power of the LoS component and the non-LoS (NLoS)
component, the channel between the BS and the m-th RIS
tile can be expressed as

and the probabilistic free space loss attenuation between the
MS and the c-th element of the m-th RIS tile, respectively.
Since the MS is rather close to the SAoS, it may not see all
those RIS tiles. Therefore, we assume each RIS tile has its

Observing at (8), on one hand, both HBS, h and Γ play
an important role in the system ergodic spectral efﬁciency
C. On the other hand, from (2), (4)-(6), it indicates that the
distance between each RIS tiles not only effects HBS and h,
but also determines the total VR of the SAoS. Furthermore,
the reﬂect coefﬁcient matrix Γ of the SAoS in (8) is
also conﬁgurable to improve the ergodic spectral efﬁciency.
Therefore, in the following, we devote to investigate the
design of SAoS to maximize the above ergodic spectral
efﬁciency.

III. ERGODIC SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

In this section, a closed-form approximation is derived
for the ergodic spectral efﬁciency. Based on the approxima-
tion, effects brought by the reﬂection coefﬁcients, deployed
position, and distance between RIS tiles of the SAoS are
investigated.

Substituting (21) into (13), then the ﬁrst term of (10) is

According to Proposition 1, when transceiver parameters
(transmit SNR 1
σ2 and receive antenna number NB) and the
environment parameters (Rician factor KB and KM, NLoS
path numbers LB and Lm,N, and NLoS free space loss

attenuation βm,l,N and αm,t,N) are ﬁxed, the ergodic spectral
efﬁciency is determined by the concrete design parameters of
the SAoS (the reﬂection coefﬁcient in Ωn,c,m,s, the number
of RIS pathes ML, the elements number in each RIS pathes
NL and the deployed position of the RIS tiles that determines
the free space attenuation βm and αn,c). In the following,
we investigate how the SAoS design impacts the ergodic
spectral efﬁciency under the condition that the transceiver
and environment parameters keep unchanged.

B. Effects of the SAoS Design

Note that to highlight the insights, the NLoS free space
attenuations between the BS/MS and the RIS tile are as-
sumed to be the same, i.e., βm,l,N = βm,N for
LB
and αm,t,N = αm,N for
Lm,N. In addition, the effects
on the approximation of the ergodic spectral efﬁciency is
analyzed indirectly by the mean receive signal power, since
Capp is only determined by S.

1) The reﬂection coefﬁcient design: As we can see from

2) The scale of the SAoS: We know that ML and NL
determine the scale of the SAoS. According to (10), the
mean receive signal power S contains four components.
When the VR of RIS tiles is omnidirectional, the ﬁrst com-
ponent, derived for the deterministic LoS channel between
the BS/MS and the RIS tiles, increases with the total number
of the RIS elements MLNL in the order of M 2
L. On
the other hand, the last three components of S, resulting
from the existent of at least one NLoS channel between
the BS/MS and the RIS tiles, increase with MLNL in the
order of MLNL. This implies that when the LoS channel
between the BS/MS and the RIS pathes become stronger,
the performance gain achieved by the increment of the RIS
element number will be more signiﬁcant.

3) The deployment of the RIS tiles: The effect of RIS tiles
arrangement can be seen from the free space attenuation.
This effect is larger for the MS than that of the BS, since
the MS is much closer to the SAoS compared with the BS
and it may not located in the VR of some RIS pathes. As
we can be see from the ﬁrst two component of S, putting
all RIS pathes closer to the MS so that all VRs cover the

receive signal power. This is what the traditional architecture
that designs the RIS as a tight uniform panel, achieves. In
practical, however, the MS is actually randomly distributed
in the blind coverage area. In this case, the traditional RIS
architecture may not provide enough SNR for the MS in
the edge of blind coverage area due to the limited VR
of RIS. On the contrary, the SAoS, covering more larger
area than its counterpart in traditional RIS architecture, can
provide even services to MS in different positions of the
blind coverage area. Therefore, under the same scale of
RIS elements, designing the total VR of SAoS proportional
to blind coverage area instead of being a compact one
will promote the ergodic spectral efﬁciency for the MS
distributed in different positions.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section,

the tightness of the approximation of
ergodic spectral efﬁciency is ﬁrstly veriﬁed, then effects of
the SAoS design on the ergodic spectral efﬁciency are also
evaluated. The system carrier frequency fc is set as 28GHz

and the transmit SNR is
KB and KM are assumed to be the same and denoted
by K. The SAoS is deployed on the yoz plane and its
center is assumed to be pS = (0, 0, 5) in the Cartesian
coordinates. We ﬁx the vertical size of SAoS as ML,v = 3
and dL,v = 1. The vertical and horizontal element space
in each RIS tile are both set as λ
6 , where λ is the carrier
wavelength. The VR of RIS tile on the xoy plane is a
90◦ section and it is omnidirectional in the z axis. The BS
is assumed to be equipped with UPA of size 4
4 and
is located at pB = (100,
100, 10). The blind coverage
−

The tightness of the approximated ergodic spectral ef-
ﬁciency in Proposition 1 is illustrated in Fig.2. Here the
horizontal size of SAoS is set as ML,h = 8 and dL,h = 3.
Each RIS tile contains 3
3 elements. It can be seen from
Fig.2 that the approximation matches well with the Monte
Carlo results, which proves the correctness of Proposition
1. Furthermore, by optimally designing the reﬂection co-
efﬁcients according to (23), the ergodic spectral efﬁciency
is signiﬁcant higer than that of using random reﬂection
coefﬁcients. As the transmit SNR increases, this performance
gain can be further enlarged. This reveals that properly
designing the reﬂection coefﬁcients is the key to exploit the
potentialities of the RIS in wireless communication systems.

Next, we evaluate the received SNR versus the scale of
SAoS under different Rician factor as shown in Fig. 3. The
number of RIS tiles remains unchanged to that of Fig. 2
while the scale of each RIS tile increases from 2
2 to
7. As shown in Fig. 3, under the same scale, increasing
7
the Rician factor can bring additional received SNR gain,
which shows the importance of deploying the SAoS in the
LoS of the BS and MS. In additional, it is worth noting that
the received SNR grows with the square of the SAoS scale
under a lager Rician factor, while the rise is linear under
small Rician factor. For example, when the scale of SAoS
increases from 600 to 1176, nearly doubled, a 5.84 dB gain
is obtained under K = 13 dB while the gain is only 2.92
dB under K =
40 dB. This scaling law is identical to
our analysis in Section III-B2, since the mean receive signal
power is dominated by the ﬁrst term and the last three terms
of (10) under lager and small Rician factor, respectively.

Finally, the effect of RIS tiles deployment is investigated.
Fig. 4 demonstrates the ergodic spectral efﬁciency versus the
horizontal deployed distance between RIS tiles. The ergodic
spectral efﬁciency is averaged over any possible position
of the MS within the blind coverage area. We keep the
size of each RIS tile as 3
3 and increase the horizontal
number of RIS tiles from 3 to 7. As shown in Fig. 4,
when ML,h is ﬁxed, the ergodic spectral efﬁciency ﬁrstly
increases with dL,h, and then decreases after reaching the
peak. Therefore, there exists an optimal deployed distance
for the SAoS to maximize the ergodic spectral efﬁciency.
The optimal deployed distance will make the VR of SAoS

approximate to the blind coverage area. For example, as we
can see from Fig. 4, the optimal deployed distance is 2 m
when ML,h = 7. We know that at x = 3 each RIS tile can
cover 6 m in y axis with a 90◦ VR section, thus 7 RIS tiles
spacing 2 m can cover 18 m, which happens to be the length
of blind coverage area in y axis. Fig. 4 also demonstrate that
when ML,h decreases, the optimal horizontal distance will
be larger since the total VR of SAoS should keep unchanged.
Compared with the compact RIS architecture, which has a
zero horizontal distance, the SAoS obtains a higher ergodic
spectral efﬁciency when deployed properly. In additional, it
should be noted that when dL,h keep increasing, the VR
of some RIS tiles will be out of the blind coverage area,
resulting in the convergence of ergodic spectral efﬁciency
for different ML,h.

efﬁciency. Based on the approximated ergodic spectral ef-
ﬁciency, the optimal reﬂection coefﬁcients of RIS can be
obtained. Furthermore, we found that
the received SNR
at
the BS increases quadratically to the number of the
RIS under large Rician factor, while this scaling law is
linear under small Rician factor. Considering the VR of
RIS tiles, the RIS should be sparsely deployed to cover
a lager blind coverage area. Numerical results veriﬁed the
tightness of the approximated ergodic spectral efﬁciency
and revealed the signiﬁcant performance gain obtained by
optimally designing the reﬂection coefﬁcients. The scaling
law for received SNR and the optimal distance between RIS
tiles were also illustrated in numerical results.
