Abstract – 

It  is  difficult  to  conduct  training  and  evaluate 
workers’  postural  performance  by  using  the  actual 
job site environment due to safety concerns. Virtual 
reality  (VR)  provides  an  alternative  to  create 
immersive working environments without significant 
safety  concerns.  Working  on  elevated  surfaces  is  a 
dangerous  scenario,  which  may  lead  to  gait  and 
postural instability and, consequently, a serious fall. 
Previous studies showed that VR is a promising tool 
for  measuring  the  impact  of  height  on  the  postural 
sway.  However,  most  of  these  studies  used  the 
treadmill  as  the  walking  locomotion  apparatus  in  a 
virtual environment (VE). This paper was focused on 
natural  walking  locomotion  to  reduce  the  inherent 
postural perturbations of VR devices. To investigate 
the impact of virtual height on gait characteristics and 
keep  the  level  of  realism  and  feeling  of  presence  at 
their highest, we enhanced the first-person-character 
model with ‘virtual legs’. Afterward, we investigated 
its  effect  on  the  gait  parameters  of  the  participants 
with and without the presence of height. To that end, 
twelve healthy adults were asked to walk on a virtual 
loop path once at the ground level and once at the 17th 
floor  of  an  unfinished  structure.  By  quantitatively 
comparing  the  participants’  gait  pattern  results,  we 
observed a decrease in the stride length and increase 
in  the  gait  duration  of  the  participants  exposed  to 
height. At the ground level the use of enhanced model 
reduced  participants’  average  stride  length  and 
height. In other words, in the presence of VR legs, the 
level of realism significantly increases and thus results 
in a better virtual gait simulation. The results of this 
study help us understand users’ behaviors when they 
were exposed to elevated surfaces and establish a firm 
ground for gait stability analysis for the future height-
related  VR  studies.  We  expect  this  developed  VR 

platform  can  generate  reliable  results  of  VR 
application in more construction safety studies.

Introduction 

According  to  the  annual  Bureau  of  Label  Statistics 
(BLS) report, the construction industry contributed more 
than 10 percent of all fatal occupational injuries in 2017 
[1].  Falling  from  elevated  surfaces  accounted  for  a 
significant portion of these incidents. According to Hsiao 
and Simonov [2], the primary stated reasons for falling 
were slips, trips, and loss of balance based on the worker 
compensation  descriptions  and  fatality  investigation 
reports. To address the disproportional rate of fall injuries 
and  fatalities,  researchers  have  been  focusing  on  the 
influential  factors  affecting  postural  sway  and  gait 
stability.  Many  of  these  experiments,  especially  those 
related to fear of height and flight,  were expensive and 
dangerous  [3].  Therefore,  recent  studies  have  been 
investigating  alternative  methods  to  conduct  postural 
stability and fall-related experiments. They found virtual 
reality (VR) as an alternative solution which “offers the 
opportunity to bring the complexity of the physical world 
into the controlled environment of the laboratory [4].” 

VR is “a simulation in which computer graphics are 
used  to  create  a  realistic-looking  world”  [5].  Powerful 
real-time interaction capability, immersion feeling, and a 
much more intuitive link between the computer and the 
user  turn  this  technology  into  one  of  the  most  rapidly 
growing  technological  fields.  Specifically,  there  are 
extensive  areas  of  VR  applications  ranging  from 
manufacturing  design  and  operation  management—
things  like  prototyping,  product  design,  planning,  and 
simulation  [6]—to  training  and  rehabilitation  [4].  VR

provides  the  users  with  an  immersive  environment,  a 
wide  range  of  view,  and  haptic  feedback,  delivering  a 
firm platform for experiment designs in a much cheaper 
and safer way. Despite the inherent instability induction 
of VR headsets [7],  this new technology has been used 
in numerous postural stability and fall studies due to its 
many  above-mentioned  capabilities  [8–12].  Although 
these  studies  attempt  to  utilize  VR  systems  to  simulate 
the  destabilizing  environment  with  different  kind  of 
stimuli,  most  of  the  experiments  did  not  focus  on  the 
natural  ground  walking 
in  a  virtual 
environment.  Furthermore,  we  did not  find any articles 
concerning the relationship between height exposure and 
gait stability. Most of the studies in this area have been 
focusing on the stationary postural sway as the dependent 
factor. For example, [8] compared the impact of real and 
virtual height on the postural stability of participants who 
were  standing  next  to  the  edge  of  an  elevated  surface. 
However, they did not measure the impact of height on 
the gait stability of the subjects. 

locomotion 

The proposed method of this study for measuring the 
gait  pattern  of  the  participants  is  to  use  a  virtual 
environment and first-person character model enhanced 
with virtual legs to simulate a more realistic gait analysis 
on  narrow,  elevated  surfaces.    By  collecting  the  time 
series  data  of  the  gait  patterns  from  the  participants’ 
mounted  trackers,  this  study  sought  to  investigate 
potential differences between the average and variability 
of subjects’ stride length and height due to elevation and 
increased realism.  

2  Background 

2.1  Fall.  The  leading  cause  of  fatalities  in  the 
construction industry is fall, contributing to 38 percent of 
all  fatal  injuries  happen  every  day  at  the  construction 
sites[1]. Numerous research has been conducted recently 
to  find  the  main  reasons  behind  the  disproportional 
number of fatalities associated with fall [2,13–18]. Slips, 
trips, and losses of balance are the most common factors 
contributing  to  falling  [2,13,15].  Hsiao  and  Simeonov 
identified  loss  of  balance  as  the  leading  cause  of  fall 
incidents.  They  stated 
that  postural  regulation  of 
construction  workers,  especially  those  who  work  on 
elevated  surfaces  such  as  roofs  or  beams,  is  one  of  the 
leading factors in fall injuries and fatalities. Therefore, a 
closer look at the postural stability and influential factors 
affecting it can provide valuable insights into the fall-risk 
assessment. 

2.2 Postural stability. Postural stability is defined 
as “the ability to maintain and control the body center of 
mass (CoM)  within the base of support to prevent falls 
and  complete  desired  movements  [19].”  Three  central 
sensory cues for postural stability regulation are visual, 
vestibular,  and  somatosensory  inputs.  Compared  to 

somatosensory and vestibular afferents triggered after the 
external exposure, visual input is considered a proactive 
mechanism of balance [2]. Paillard and Noe showed that 
expertise has a strong relationship with the visual input 
dependencies for postural regulation [20]. To accurately 
study the impact of visual input on the postural stability 
of  the  construction  workers,  we  need  to  answer  the 
following two questions: 1. How postural metrics can be 
measured, and 2. How do individuals respond to different 
visual  perturbations  affecting  postural  sway,  especially 
those associated with height?  

2.3  Postural  metrics.  Based  on  the  definition  of 
postural stability presented earlier, one way of measuring 
postural  metrics  is  to  measure  the  extent  to  which  the 
center  of  the  body  deviates  from  the  base  (feet).  Three 
principal reference planes are describing the anatomical 
motion of the body, transverse, frontal, and the median 
plane.  The  three  sway  directions  namely  frontier-
posterior,  mediolateral,  and  inferior  sway  happens 
respectively  on  the  frontal,  medial,  and  inferior  planes. 
Biomechanical studies use maximum body sway (BS) in 
the frontier-posterior and mediolateral direction  [21,22] 
and  the  root  mean  square  of  the  total  body  velocity  in 
frontier-posterior, mediolateral, and inferior direction [21] 
to measure the response of individual to different stimuli. 
The  required  data  can  be  obtained  by  using  the  force 
plates or IMU sensors [23]. The other way of measuring 
the  dynamic  postural  sway  responses 
to  external 
perturbations  is  to  use  Maximum  Lyapunov  exponent 
(Max LE) [24,25]. Lyapunov exponent directly measures 
the  sensitivity  of  a  dynamical  system  to  minimal 
perturbations, considered to be a decent indicator of the 
level  of  chaos  in  the  system  [26].    By  utilizing  this 
method, the time series data captured by IMU sensors can 
then  be  investigated  for  any  divergence  reflecting  the 
response  of 
the  external 
perturbations. To efficiently find the reasons behind the 
postural  instability  of  construction  workers,  identifying 
workers’  responses  to  diverse  types  of  external  visual 
perturbations  is  of  great  importance.  Accordingly, 
numerous  studies  have  been  conducted  on  human 
subjects to find out the impacts of different perturbations 
on  the  postural  sway  [3,19,27,28].  Interestingly,  while 
postural  stability  is  sensitive  to  the  amplitude  of  these 
perturbations,  the  type  of  perturbation  has  far  more 
impact  on  postural  stability  than  the  corresponding 
amplitude  does  [19].  Therefore,  finding  stimulus’ 
characteristics  is  considered  a  critical  step  in  fall-
prevention  techniques.  Based  on  Hsiao  and  Simeonov 
critical  review,  the  most  significant  environmental 
factors affecting postural stability are elevation, moving 
visual  scenes,  depth  perception,  visual  ambiguity,  and 
obstacle  detection  ability  [2].  Since  a  high  number  of 
fatalities  are  due  to  falling  from  elevated  surfaces,  the 
current study will focus only on elevation as one of the

two  common  procedures 

2.4 Elevation, fear of height and VR. The deficit 
of  close  visual  contact  due  to  the  instigating  sensory 
mismatch, and fear-related reactions, especially close to 
edges  of  elevated  surfaces,  are 
two  main 
characteristics  of  elevation  leading  to  falling  [2,29].  In 
many gaits and postural studies related to elevation and 
fear  of  height,  pseudo-environment  setup  and  stimuli 
simulations  are 
to 
investigate  the  impact  of  the  factors  mentioned  above. 
However,  due  to  versatility  of  VR  tools  in  generating 
virtual  environment  and  various  visual  stimuli,  and  the 
unsafe  nature  of  mechanical  systems  in  provoking 
postural instability, VR systems have been widely used 
in  fear-related  behavioral  and  psychological  responses 
[3,8,12,28,30]. Regenbrecht et al. scrutinized the concept 
of “presence” and explained that VR is a powerful tool in 
establishing  an  immersive  environment  to  convey  the 
feeling of presence to the user [30]. Wallach and Bar-Zvi 
showed that people suffering from flight phobia could be 
treated by using VR technology [12]. With an exposure-
treatment approach, Rothbaum et al. measured the level 
of  anxiety,  avoidance,  and  attitudes  of  the  participants 
before  and  after  treatment  with  VR  systems  [28].  The 
outcome  of  the  study  showed  a  significant  difference 
between 
the  self-reported  results  of  anxiety  and 
avoidance of height of participants treated by computer-
generated exposure, before and after treatments. In 2012, 
Celworth  et  al.  compared  the  impact  of  height  on  the 
postural stability and anxiety  level of  subjects in a real 
and  virtual  environment.  They  used  force  plates  to 
measure the center of body frequency and subsequently 
the stationary balance, and electrodermal activity (EDP) 
to measure anxiety. By sampling 17 young adults, while 
minimizing the inherent VR postural instability effect [7], 
they  showed  that  virtual  environment  (VE)  could 
simulate  the  height  effect  on  the  mediolateral  and 
anterior-posterior  balance  of  the  subjects  similar  to  the 
real  height  effect.  They  concluded  that  VR  could  be  a 
useful  study  and  rehabilitation  tool  for  people  with 
balance regulation deficits associated with fear or height. 
Numerous studies discussed the impact of gait speed and 
stride  length  on  the  overall  gait  stability  and  odds  of 
falling in humans [31]. Step and stride length measures 
the distance between successive points of heel contact of 
opposite foot and same foot correspondingly. Based on 
the gait stability studies, the differences between the gait 
cycle patterns can be good indicators of the overall gait 
stability performance. During a simple walk the foot will 
experience periodic movement, which can be represented 
by  the  spatiotemporal  acceleration  and  deceleration 
values. It is assumed that for a stable gait, the acceleration 
values should be following similar patterns and that the 
changes  are  periodically  repeated.  If  there  is  any 

irregularity in this cyclic pattern, it indicates that there is 
an  external  (e.g.,  exposure  to  height)  or  internal 
disturbance (e.g., unstable CoM) in the system. Previous 
research suggests that people have a tendency to reduce 
their gait stride and speed when they suffer a preexisting 
fear  of  falling  [32,33].  Interestingly,  a  higher  level  of 
walking  disorder  parameters--such  as  gait  stride 
variability--can be affected by the fear of height as well 
[32].   

In  the  light  of  foregoing  research,  the  current  study 
will focus on analyzing the time series data obtained in 
various VR/non-VR scenarios by retrieving the position 
of  the  HTC  Vive  trackers  attached  to  the  participants’ 
feet.  Furthermore,  by  quantitatively  comparing  these 
time-series  data,  this  paper  aims  to  present  the  ground 
walking experiments in VR as a promising tool for time-
series  data  collection 
in  different  destabilizing 
environments,  e.g.,  walking  on  an  unguarded  narrow 
elevated surface. To this end, the  first-person character 
model  developed  in  Unity  will  be  enhanced  with  the 
virtual  legs,  helping  the  subject  to  walk  on  a  virtual 
structural-beam  path  close  to  that  he  would  perform  in 
reality.  Afterward,  the  role  of  VR  legs  and  height  in 
predicting  the  average  value  and  the  variability  of  gait 
stride parameters will be studied. By finding differences 
in  gait  pattern  of 
these 
experiments, further data analysis for obtaining postural 
sways such as finding MaxLE or maximum BS becomes 
both possible and promising.

3  Methodology 

from 

To compare the impact of height on the gait stability 
of 
two  different 
the  12  volunteer  participants, 
experiments were designed (see Figure 1), each with two  
settings:  one  with  no  VR  leg,  and  one  with  VR  leg 
enhancement (see Table 1). In all the corresponding VR 
experiments,  we  attempted  to  minimize  the  inherent 
postural perturbations of VR headsets by simulating a VE 
as a static visual scene, removing any visual and physical 
distractions 
the  virtual  environment,  and 
minimizing the VR experiments durations (Horlings et al. 
2009).  To  reduce 
the 
participants were instructed to stand, look, and walk for 
few  steps  in  the  VE  for  1  minute  total.  The  VR 
environment was the same environment that they would 
experience in the other parts of the data collection. After  
the  completion  of  this  part,  the  participants  were 
equipped with three HTC Vive trackers and an HTC Vive 
headset. In the first trial, the 'immersed' beam path was 
presented to the participants while they were able to see 
their virtual legs. The immersed path consists of a closed 
triangular  polygon  constructed  by  three  connected 
structural  beams,  with  no  elevation  (figure  1-a).  The 
participants  were  instructed  to  walk  on  the  path  at  a 

the  VR  unfamiliarity,  all

comfortable  speed.  During  this  trial  and  others  that 
followed, the coordinates of the trackers attached to the 
participants’ feet were retrieved with the refresh rate of 
60 times per second. The procedure for the second trial 
was  identical  to  the  first  trial  except  that  the  VR  leg 
enhancement was not available to the participants. In the 
third  trial,  the  participants  were  subjected  to  height  by 
locating the triangular beam path on the 17th floor of an 
unfinished building (figure 1-b). The virtual environment 
remained  unchanged save for the height.  Similar to the 
first trial, the participants were able to see their VR legs. 
In the last trial, the participants were asked to walk again 
on the same elevated path again. However, the third trial 
excluded virtual legs from the VR model. In other words, 
the participants were not able to see their virtual legs as 
they had been in the first and second trials.

4  Results and Analysis 

Gait analysis often includes the spatial and temporal 
measurement of a gait cycle so that the interesting factors 
can be inferred by comparing the differences between the 
measurements. Therefore, the focus of this study was on 
the gait parameters; namely, average speed, length of step 
and  stride,  and 
their  variabilities.  As  mentioned 
previously,  the  x,  y,  and  z  coordinates  of  each  tracker 
(attached to participants’ feet) were recorded during each 
trial.  Figure  2  shows  a  sample  gait  pattern  plotted  by 
using  one  of  the  participant’s  right  tracker  position 
dataset.  The  solid  lines  showed  trials  with  models 
enhanced with virtual legs and the dashed lines showed 
those trials without any enhanced virtual legs. Similarly, 
those lines accompanied by the astride sign ‘*’ represent 
trials conducted in the presence of virtual height,  while 
those with no ‘*’ represents trials without the presence of 
elevation.  To  study  the  impact  of  our  two  purposed 
factors—namely, height and virtual legs--we conducted 
series  of  two-tailed  paired  T-tests  between  relevant 
groups  divided  based  on  the  presence  of  the  focused 
factor. The results of the paired T-test are valid as long as 
the distribution of the data for each group is normal, and 
each participant is compared with himself/herself. To test 
the normality of the data, the Anderson-Darling test was 
performed  for  each  comparison  executed  between  the 
two  paired  groups  (Anderson  and  Darling  1952).  For 
each  comparison  case,  the  null  hypothesis  was  not 
rejected. More specifically, the results of the ‘normality 
tests’  showed  that  the  distribution  of  the  paired  groups 
data is normally distributed.   

By statistically comparing the gait durations across all 
scenarios, we found out that (1) LEGS: by enhancing 
the participants’ virtual models with virtual legs, the 
duration of the ground walking trials increased 
significantly compared to cases in which the virtual legs

were not present (P value= 0.0004). Also, the paired T-
test  showed  that  the  presence  of  VR  legs  noticeably 
decreased  the  average  gait  stride  height  on  the  non-
elevated  walking  path.  Interestingly,  no  significant 
increase in the duration of the trials performed at height 
was  observed  while  the  effect  of  virtual  legs  was 
considered, and (2) HEIGHT: while the participants were 
able to use their virtual legs in the manifestation of height, 
the  average  stride  length  of  the  participants  decreased 
significantly  (P  value=  0.00004).  Even  without  the 
virtual  legs,  a  similar  height  effect  was  detected  (P 
value=0.015).  In  addition,  the  duration  of  the  trials 
performed  with 
(P 
value=0.005) virtual legs was noticeably increased once 
the  subjects  were  exposed  to  height.  No  prominent 
difference  in  the  stride  heights  was  detected  with  or 
without  the  presence  of  height.  However,  the  stride 
height variability was meaningfully increased when the 
participants,  equipped  with  the  enhanced  model,  were 

(P  value=0.03)  and  without 

subjected to height (P value=0.02). 

5  Discussion and Conclusion 

regarding 

By  analyzing 

the  basic 
the  data 
spatiotemporal variables of  stride  length and speed,  we 
detected  a  noticeable  stride  length  difference  across 
different scenarios. More precisely, when we focused on 
height  as  the  influential  factor,  we  observed  that  the 
number  of  strides  significantly  increased  while  the 
average  stride  length  significantly  decreased.  Hence, 
these  reductions  of  participants’  gait  speed  and  stride 
length imply that the participants attempted to walk more 
“carefully.” The decrease in gait speed and stride length 
between  ground  and  elevated  walking  is  in  line  with 
Sheik_Nainar and Kaber’s findings [34]. Also, Schniepp 
et  al.’s  experiment  results  [35]  demonstrated  the  same 
bodily reactions from participants subject to destabilizing 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
36th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC 2019) 

environments. The decrease in stride length as a result of 
participants  being  asked  to  walk  on  the  elevated  path 
confirms Schniepp et al.’s previous results, with the only 
difference being a real elevated path for their experiments 
as compared to a VR simulation in ours.  

  Another interesting result  was the reduction in 
the  average  stride  length  combined  with  an  increase  in 
both  the  average  stride  height  and  the  duration  of  the 
trials once the participants had access to the enhanced VR 
model for the ground walking trials. In other words, with 
the  presence  of  virtual  legs,  the  participants  walked  on 
the path instead of just ‘following the path.’ This would 
imply  that  the  use  of  responsive  and  real-time  tracking 
virtual  legs  will  increase  the  level  of  realism  for  the 
participants.  However,  a  similar  statistically  significant 
result was not spotted for the elevated walking trials. The 
average  participant’s  stride  length  did  not  decrease 
significantly  (P-value=0.296).  This  finding  perhaps 
indicates  that  height  was  the  dominant  factor  here, 
reducing  the  average  stride  length  even  without  the 
presence of the virtual legs.  

  Based on the result of table 2, the stride height 
variability was significantly affected by height as well (P-
value=0.0281).  The  standard  deviation  of  the  stride 
height was lower for the data obtained from the ground 
walking trial with the presence of virtual legs compared 
to  those  extracted  from  the  elevated  path  that  also 
included the presence of virtual legs. This higher level of 
walking disorder parameters can be affected by the fear 
of  height  [32].  The  thought-provoking  part  of  these 
findings  was  that,  in  the  absence  of  virtual  legs,  there 
were  no  significant  variability  differences  between  the 
two datasets pertaining  to ground  walking and  walking 
on the height. Whether the cause of this phenomenon was 
the participants’ attempts to place their feet exactly on the 
beam or the participants’ experience of changes in their 
visual and vestibular systems, we cannot know for sure. 
However, it is quite apparent that the presence of virtual 
legs  has an impact on the gait parameters, even for the 
higher level of  walking disorder parameters. Therefore, 
we conclude that walking on the virtual structural beams 
without  being  able  to  look  at  one’s  virtual  legs  is  less 
realistic  than  when  someone  walks  with  virtual  legs  in 
view.      

Overall,  these  findings  show  that  VR,  along  with 
the advanced virtual models, was successful in inducing 
the  height  effect  on  the  basic  spatiotemporal  variables 
related  to  gait.  Since  these  variables  are  essential  to 
postural  sway  and  gait  stability  measurements,  the 
finding  of  the  current  study  could  be  a  good  start  in 
designing  efficient,  height-related  experiments  for 
construction workers’ posture and gait assessments with 
fewer safety concerns. In addition, many of these virtual 
experiments  can  be  integrated  with  other  evolving 
construction safety studies such as eye-tracking and risk 

perception  [36,37],  cultural  factors  and  risk  perception 
[38], and intoxication at construction sites [39].
