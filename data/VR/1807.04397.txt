Millimeter Wave Line-of-Sight Blockage Analysis

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems can provide high data

rates but the system performance may degrade signiﬁcantly due to mobile block-

ers and the user’s own body. A high frequency of interruptions and long dura-

tion of blockage may degrade the quality of experience. For example, delays

of more than about 10ms cause nausea to VR viewers. Macro-diversity of base

stations (BSs) has been considered a promising solution where the user equip-

ment (UE) can handover to other available BSs, if the current serving BS gets

blocked. However, an analytical model for the frequency and duration of dy-

namic blockage events in this setting is largely unknown.

In this thesis, we

consider an open park-like scenario and obtain closed-form expressions for the

blockage probability, expected frequency and duration of blockage events us-

ing stochastic geometry. Our results indicate that the minimum density of BS

that is required to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of AR/VR

and other low latency applications is largely driven by blockage events rather

than capacity requirements. Placing the BS at a greater height reduces the likeli-

hood of blockage. We present a closed-form expression for the BS density-height

trade-off that can be used for network planning.

Introduction

1.1 Motivation

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems can provide high data rates

of the order of a few Gbps [2], suitable for the Quality of Service (QoS) require-

ments for Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). For these appli-

cations, the user-equipment (UE) requires the data rate to be in the range of

100 Mbps to a few Gbps, and an end-to-end latency in the range of 1 ms to

10 ms [3]. However, mmWave communication systems are quite vulnerable to

blockages due to higher penetration losses and reduced diffraction [4]. Even the

human body can reduce the signal strength by 20 dB [5]. Thus, an unblocked

Line of Sight (LOS) link is highly desirable for mmWave systems. Furthermore,

a mobile human blocker can block the LOS path between User Equipment (UE)

and Base Station (BS) for approximately 500 ms [5]. The frequent blockages of

mmWave LOS links and a high blockage duration can be detrimental to ultra-

reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) applications. While many

proposals to achieve low latency and high reliability have been proposed, such

as edge caching, edge computing, network slicing [6, 7], a shorter Transmission

2

Time Interval (TTI), frame structure [8], and ﬂow queueing with dynamic siz-

ing of the Radio Link Control (RLC) buffer at Data Link Layer [9], we focus our

analysis on issues related to Radio Access Network (RAN) planning to achieve

the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of URLLC applications.

One potential solution to blockages in the mmWave cellular network can be

macro-diversity of BSs and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) techniques. These

techniques have shown a signiﬁcant reduction in interference and improvement

in reliability, coverage, and capacity in the current Long Term Evolution-Advance

(LTE-A) deployments and other communication networks [10–12]. Furthermore,

Radio Access Networks (RANs) are moving towards the cloud-RAN architec-

ture that implements macro-diversity and CoMP techniques by pooling a large

number of BSs in a single centralized baseband unit (BBU) [13, 14]. As a single

centralized BBU handles multiple BSs, the handover and beam-steering time

can be reduced signiﬁcantly [15]. In order to provide seamless connectivity for

ultra-reliable and ultra-low latency applications, the proposed 5G mmWave cel-

lular architecture needs to consider key QoS parameters such as the probability

of blockage events, the frequency of blockages, and the blockage duration. For

instance, to satisfy the QoS requirement of mission-critical applications such as

AR/VR, tactile Internet, and eHealth applications, 5G cellular networks target

a service reliability of 99.999% [16]. In general, the service interruption due to

blockage events can be alleviated by caching the downlink contents at the BSs

or the network edge [17]. However, caching the content more than about 10ms

may degrade the user experience and may cause nausea to the users particu-

larly for AR applications [18]. An alternative when blocked is to ofﬂoad trafﬁc

to sub-6GHz networks such as 4G, but this needs to be carefully engineered so

as to not overload them. Therefore, it is important to study the blockage prob-

ability, blockage frequency, and blockage duration to satisfy the desired QoS

requirements.

This work presents a simpliﬁed blockage model for the LOS link using tools

from the stochastic geometry. In particular, our contributions are as follow:

1. We provide an analytical model for dynamic blockage (UE blocked by mo-

bile blockers) and self-blockage (UE blocked by the user’s own body). The

expression for the rate of blockage of LOS link is evaluated as a function

of the blocker density, velocity, height and link length.

2. We evaluate the closed-form probability and expected frequency of simul-

taneous blockage of all BSs in the range of the UE. Further, we present an

approximation for the expected duration of simultaneous blockage.

3. We verify our analytical results through Monte-Carlo simulations by con-

sidering a random way-point mobility model for blockers.

4. Finally, we present a case study to ﬁnd the minimum required BS density

for speciﬁc mission-critical services and analyze the trade-off between BS

height and density to satisfy the QoS requirements.

1.3 Related Work

A mmWave link may have three kinds of blockages, namely, static, dynamic,

and self-blockage. Static blockage due to buildings and permanent structures

has been studied in [19] and [20] using random shape theory and a stochastic

geometry approach for urban microwave systems. The underlying static block-

age model is incorporated into the cellular system coverage and rate analysis

4

in [4]. Static blockage may cause permanent blockage of the LOS link. However,

for an open area such as a public park, static blockages play a small role. The sec-

ond type of blockage is dynamic blockage due to mobile humans and vehicles

(collectively called mobile blockers) which may cause frequent interruptions to

the LOS link. Dynamic blockage has been given signiﬁcant importance by 3GPP

in TR 38.901 of Release 14 [21]. An analytical model in [22] considers a single

access point, a stationary user, and blockers located randomly in an area. The

model in [23] is developed for a speciﬁc scenario of a road intersection using

a Manhattan Poisson point process model. MacCartney et al. [5] developed a

Markov model for blockage events based on measurements on a single BS-UE

link. Similarly, Raghavan et al. [24] ﬁts the blockage measurements with var-

ious statistical models. However, a model based on experimental analysis is

very speciﬁc to the measurement scenario. The authors in [25] considered a 3D

blockage model and analyzed the blocker arrival probability for a single BS-UE

pair. Studies of spatial correlation and temporal variation in blockage events

for a single BS-UE link are presented in [26] and [27]. However, their analyti-

cal model is not easily scalable to multiple BSs, important when considering the

impact of macro-diversity..

Apart from static and dynamic blockage, self-blockage plays a key role in

mmWave performance. The authors of [28] studied human body blockage through

simulation. A statistical self-blockage model is developed in [24] through exper-

iments considering various modes (landscape or portrait) of hand-held devices.

The impact of self-blockage on received signal strength is studied in [20] through

a stochastic geometry model. They assume the self-blockage due to a user’s

body blocks the BSs in an area represented by a cone.

All the above blockage models consider the UE’s association with a single

BS. Macro-diversity of BSs is considered as a potential solution to alleviate the

1.4. Organization

5

effect of blockage events in a cellular network. The authors of [29] and [30]

proposed an architecture for macro-diversity with multiple BSs and showed the

improvement in network throughput. A blockage model with macro-diversity

is developed in [31] for independent blocking and in [32] for correlated blocking.

However, they consider only static blockage due to buildings.

The primary purpose of the blockage models in previous papers was to study

the coverage and capacity analysis of the mmWave system. However, apart

from the signal degradation, blockage frequency and duration also affects the

performance of the mmWave system and are critically important for applica-

tions such as AR/VR. In this paper, we present a simple closed-form expression

for a compact analysis to provide insight into the optimal density, height and

other design parameters and trade-offs of BS deployment.

1.4 Organization

The rest of the thesis is organized as follows. The system model is described

in Chapter 2. A generalized blockage model considering dynamic and self-

blockages is presented in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 generalizes the blockage model

to multiple BSs and evaluates the key blockage metrics—blockage probability,

blockage frequency, and the blockage duration. We present simulation results

and verify our theoretical formulations in Chapter 5. Finally, we conclude this

thesis and discuss the future work in Chapter 6.

System Model

2.1 BS model and blockage model

Our system model consists of the following settings:

BS Model: The mmWave BS locations are modeled as a homogeneous Pois-

•

son Point Process (PPP) with density λT. Consider a disc B(o, R) of radius

R and centered around the origin o, where a typical UE is located. We as-

sume that each BS in B(o, R) is a potential serving BS for the UE. Thus, the

number of BSs M in the disc B(o, R) of area πR2 follows a Poisson distri-

bution with parameter λTπR2, i.e.,

PM(m) =

[λTπR2]m

FIGURE 2.1: System Model

Self-blockage Model: The user blocks a fraction of BSs due to his/her own

body. The self-blockage zone is deﬁned as a sector of the disc B(o, R) mak-

ing an angle ω towards the user’s body as shown in Figure 2.1(a). Thus,

all of the BSs in the self-blockage zone are considered blocked.

Dynamic Blockage Model: The blockers are distributed according to a homo-

geneous PPP with parameter λB. Further, the arrival process of the block-

ers crossing the ith BS-UE link is Poisson with intensity αi. The blockage

duration is independent of the blocker arrival process and is exponentially

distributed with parameter µ.

Connectivity Model: We say the UE is blocked when all of the potential

serving BSs in the disc B(o, R) are blocked simultaneously.

2.2 Single BS-UE link

For a sound understanding of the system model, consider a single BS-UE LOS

link in Figure 2.1(a). The distance between the ith BS and the UE is ri and the LOS

link makes an angle θ with respect to the positive x-axis. Further, the blockers in

the region move with constant velocity V at an angle ϕ with the positive x-axis,

evaluated in Lemma 1.

(cid:4)

Following [27], we model the blocker arrival process as Poisson with pa-

rameter αi blockers/sec (bl/s). Note that there can be more than one blocker

simultaneously blocking the LOS link. The overall blocking process has been

modeled in [27] as an alternating renewal process with alternate periods of

blocked/unblocked intervals, where the distribution of the blocked interval is

obtained as the busy period distribution of a general M/GI/∞ system. For

mathematical simplicity, we assume the blockage duration of a single blocker is

exponentially distributed with parameter µ, thus, forming an M/M/∞ queu-

ing system. We further approximate the overall blockage process as an alter-

nating renewal process with exponentially distributed periods of blocked and

unblocked intervals with parameters αi and µ respectively. This approximation

works for a wide range of blocker densities as shown in Section 5.1. This ap-

proximation is also justiﬁed in Lemma 2 as follow

Lemma 2. Let PS denote the probability that there are two or more blockers simultane-

ously blocking the single BS-UE link. Then, in order to have PS ≤

(2.8)

(cid:4)

From Lemma 2, we can say that the probability PS is low for lower blocker

density λB as shown in Figure 2.2. In the worst case scenario when the distance
between BS and UE is 100 m, i.e., rn = 100, in order to have PS ≤
blocker density λB can be as high as 0.2 bl/m2 and the blocker arrival rate αi

0.1, the

can be as high as 1.1 bl/sec. In fact, based on the real measurements obtained in

Brooklyn, New York, USA, George et. al., have shown that the blockage rate of a

single BS-UE link is approximately 0.2 bl/s in an urban scenario [5]. Therefore,

as a ﬁrst-order approximation and for reasonable values of blocker densities, we

can ignore the events of simultaneously having more than one blockers in the

blockage zone.

In the next chapter, we consider a generalized blockage model for M BSs

which are in the range of UE. The UE keeps track of all these M BSs using well-

designed beam-tracking and handover techniques. Since the handover process

is assumed to be very fast, the UE can instantaneously connect to any unblocked

BS when the current serving BS gets blocked. Therefore, we consider the total

blockage event occurs only when all the potential serving BSs are blocked.

3.2 Generalized Model with Dynamic Blockage

Given there are n BSs in the communication range of UE and are not blocked by

user’s body, they can still get blocked by mobile blockers. The blocking event

of these N BSs is assumed to be independent. Our objective is to develop a

blockage model for the mmWave cellular system where the UE can connect to

any of the potential serving BSs. In such a system, the blockage probability, ex-

pected blockage frequency, and expected blockage duration are the deﬁning QoS

parameters for low and ultra-low latency applications such as AR/VR. Since

the blockage events form an alternating renewal process with exponentially dis-

tributed duration of blocked and unblocked intervals, we formulate a Markov

chain to obtain the probability and duration of the simultaneous blockage of k

BSs out of the total N available BSs.

The Markov chain shown in Figure 3.1 has 2n states where each state repre-

sents the blockage of a subset of n BSs. Let a set

4.3 Expected Blockage Frequency

From the Markov model in Figure 3.1, we know that the total arrival rate of

blockers in the state when all BSs get simultaneously blocked is same as the total

departure rate from that state in the equilibrium. Therefore, the frequency/rate

of simultaneous blockage of all N BSs is:

We show that the duration of the blockage of all n BSs follows an exponen-

tial distribution with mean 1/nµ. Consider a time instant when all n BSs are

blocked; the residual duration of the blockage period of the ith BS-UE link fol-

lows the same distribution as fTi (ti) because of the memoryless property of the

exponential distribution. Therefore, the duration of the period of simultaneous

blockage of all n BSs is a random variable TB = min

Numerical Evaluation

5.1 Simulation Setup

This section compares our analytical results with MATLAB simulation1 where

the movement of blockers is generated using the random waypoint mobility

model [33, 34]. For the simulation, we consider a rectangular box of 200 m

×
200 m and blockers are located uniformly in this area. Our area of interest is the

disc B(o, R) of radius R = 100m, which perfectly ﬁts in the considered rectan-

gular area. The blockers chose a direction randomly, and move in that direction

for a time-duration of t

∼

Unif[0, 60] sec. To maintain the density of blockers in

the rectangular region, we consider that once a blocker reaches the edge of the

rectangle, they get reﬂected.

We used the Mathwork code for this purpose. The simulation runs for an

hour. We note the time instant when the blocker crosses a BS-UE link and gener-

ate a blockage duration through a realization of an exponential distribution with

mean µ = 2. Further, we collect the time-series of alternate blocked/unblocked

intervals for all the BS-UE links and take their intersection to obtain a time-series

that represent the events of blockage of all available BSs. The blockage proba-

bility, frequency, and duration can be obtained from this time-series. Finally, we

5.2 Main Results

We present the comparison between our analytical and simulation results with

the joint impact of the dynamic and self-blockages.

We consider two values of mobile blocker density, 0.01 and 0.1 bl/m2, and

two values of the self-blocking angle ω (0 and π/3) for our study. Figures 5.1, 5.2,

and 5.3 present the statistics of blockages when the UE has at least one serving

BS, i.e., the UE is always in the coverage area of at least one BS. From Figure 5.1

and Figure 5.2, we can observe that the blockage probability and the expected

blockage frequency decrease exponentially with BS density. From the point

of view of interactive applications such as AR/VR, video conferencing, online

gaming, and others, this means that a higher BS density can potentially decrease

interruptions in the data transmission. For example, for a blocker density of 0.1

bl/m2, a BS density of 100/km2 can decrease the interruptions to once in ten sec-

onds, 200/km2 can decrease them to once in 100 seconds, and 300/km2 decrease

them to once in 1000 seconds. Reducing the frequency of interruptions is partic-

ularly crucial for AR/VR applications, therefore from this perspective a density

of 200-300/km2 may be required. This corresponds to about 6 to 9 BS, respec-

tively, within the range of each UE. From Figure 5.3, we can observe that caching

of 100 ms worth of data is required for a BS density 200/km2 to have uninter-

rupted services. For AR and tactile applications, caching is not a solution and

a delay of 100 ms may be an unacceptable delay. Switching to microwave net-

works such as 4G during blockage events may be an alternative solution instead

of deploying a high BS density, but then this may need careful network plan-

ning so as to not overload the 4G network. The amount of required cached data

decreases with increasing BS density. A BS density of 300/km2 and 500/km2

can bring down the required cached data to 60 ms and 40 ms, respectively. This

the cellular architecture needs to consider the optimal amount of cached data

and the optimal BS density needed to mitigate the effect of these occasional high

blockage durations to satisfy QoS requirements for AR/VR application without

creating nausea. A tentative conclusion is that perhaps a minimum acceptable

density of 300/km2 (which corresponds to about 9 BS within range of each UE)

is needed to keep interruptions lasting about 60 ms to once every 1000 seconds.

We also observe that both simulation and analytical results are approximately

the same for a low blocker density of 0.01 bl/m2. From Figure 5.3, we observe

our analytical result deviates from the simulation result for lower values of BS

densities. However, the percentage error (

5 is 400 BS/km2 for a blocker density of 0.01 bl/m2 and self-

blockage angle of 60o. For a higher blocker density, the required BS density

increases linearly. Note that this again imposes a higher BS density than would

be necessary from most models based solely on capacity needs (roughly 100

BS/km2 [2]).

5.3.2 BS density-height trade-off analysis

The BS height vs. density trade-off is shown in Figure 5.4. Note, for example,

that doubling the height of the BS from 4m to 8 m reduces the BS station density

requirement by approximately 20% for blocker density λB = 0.1 bl/m2 and self-

blockage angle ω = 60o. The optimal BS height and density can be obtained by

performing a cost analysis.

Conclusions and Future Work

6.1 Conclusion

In this thesis, we analyzed the blockage problem in mmWave cellular networks.

Speciﬁcally, we considered an open park-like scenario with dynamic blockages

due to mobile humans and vehicles collectively called the mobile blockers. The

blockage rate which is deﬁned as the rate of blockage of the BS-UE LOS link

by the mobile blockers is evaluated as a function of blocker density, height, and

velocity. We also considered self-blockage due to user’s own body. The block-

age process of a single BS-UE link is modeled as an alternating renewal process

with exponentially distributed intervals of blocked and unblocked periods. We

extend the blocking scenario to consider multiple BSs using stochastic geometry

and a Markov chain model. In particular, we consider that the UE can instan-

taneously switch between the BSs in case the currently serving BS gets blocked.

In this setting, the blockage event occurs when all BSs in the range of UE are

simultaneously blocked. We derived the closed-form expressions for blockage

probability and blockage frequency as a function of the density and height of the

BS and blockers. We also evaluated an approximate expression of the blockage

duration. Finally, we veriﬁed our theoretical model with MATLAB simulations

The minimum density of BS required to bound the blockage probability

below 1e

−

5 for the blocker density of 0.01bl/m2 and self-blockage angle

ω = 60o is 400 BS/km2 (effective cell size 25m). This requirement is much

higher than that obtained from capacity constraints alone.

The blockage duration at high BS density saturates to around 40 ms which

is higher than that required for AR/VR applications.

The BS density can be reduced by increasing the BS height. The increase in

height from 4 m to 8 m can reduce the BS density by 20%. Further increase

in height may not lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in density.

6.2 Future Work

The following extensions are planned for future work

•

•

•

Generalized blockage model: We can add a simple model for static block-

age in our analysis of dynamic and self-blockage.

Data rate analysis: The data rates of a typical user can be evaluated using

the generalized blockage model. We are interested in evaluating whether

5G mmWave is capacity limited or blockage limited.

Fallback to 4G LTE: We plan to explore the potential solution to blockages

as switching to 4G LTE. Whether 4G would be able to handle the huge

intermittent 5G trafﬁc.

6.2. Future Work

•

•

Deterministic networks: We have considered a random deployment of BSs

in our analysis. However, in most cases, the deployments of BSs are based

on a deterministic hexagonal grid. Therefore, a blockage model for the

deterministic networks is more practical.

Backhoul capacity analysis: With the UEs switching between BSs in case of

blockage events, the backhoul capacity requirements for the BS may have

high ﬂuctuations. It is interesting to study that random process.
