Abstract

In a massive MIMO system with large arrays, the channel becomes spatially non-stationary. We

study the impact of spatial non-stationarity characterized by visibility regions (VRs) where the channel

energy is signiﬁcant on a portion of the array. Relying on a channel model based on VRs, we provide

expressions of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of conjugate beamforming (CB) and

zero-forcing (ZF) precoders. We also provide an approximate deterministic equivalent of the SINR of ZF

precoders. We identify favorable and unfavorable multi-user conﬁgurations of the VRs and compare the

performance of both stationary and non-stationary channels through analysis and numerical simulations.

I. INTRODUCTION

A massive MIMO system [1] is characterized by the use of many antennas and support for

multiple users. At the extreme, the arrays may be physically very large [2]–[4] and integrated

into large structures like stadiums, or shopping malls. Unfortunately, when the dimension of the

antenna array becomes large, different kinds of non-stationarities appear across the array. Further,

different parts of the array may observe the same channel paths with different power, or even

entirely different channel paths [2]. This effect may even be observed for compact arrays [2]. We

show that non-stationarity in massive arrays has a signiﬁcant impact on performance assessment

and transceiver design.

We propose a simple non-stationary channel model and analyze the performance of CB and

ZF in the downlink of a multi-user massive MIMO system. The channel model is based on

VRs that capture the received power variation across the array. We also propose a closed-form

approximation of the SINR of the ZF receiver. The expression shows the dependence of the SINR

on channel parameters and allows a comparison between spatially stationary and non-stationary

channels. The analysis and simulation results show that the impact of spatial non-stationarity on

the performance of linear receivers is scenario dependent.

Few theoretical studies exist on spatially non-stationary channels in massive MIMO systems.

In [5] a spherical wave-front based LOS channel model was proposed and the channel capacity

is studied with the proposed model. In [6] an upper bound on the ergodic capacity of a non-

stationary channel was provided. No prior work, however, has studied the performance of linear

precoders with non-stationary channels.

II. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODEL

We consider a narrowband broadcast system where the base-station (BS) equipped with M

antennas is serving K single-antenna users (M ≥ K). The BS serves all the users using the
same time-frequency resource. The signal for user k, sk is precoded by gk ∈ CM and scaled by

the signal power pk ≥ 0 before transmission. The transmit vector x is the linear combination of

the precoded and scaled signals of all the users, i.e.,

x =

K
(cid:88)

√

k=1

pkgksk.

(1)

Let G = [g1, g2, · · · , gK] ∈ CM ×K be the combined precoding matrix, P = diag([p1, p2, · · · , pK]T) ∈
RK×K be the diagonal matrix of signal powers, and P ≥ 0 be the total power. The combined

precoding matrix G is normalized to satisfy the power constraint

E[(cid:107)x(cid:107)2] = tr(PG∗G) = P.

(2)

Let hk ∈ CM denotes the random channel from the BS to user k. Then the received signal at

the user k is

yk = h∗

kx + nk, k = 1, 2, · · · , K,

(3)

where nk ∼ CN (0, σ2) is the additive noise. Assuming independent Gaussian signaling, i.e.,
sk ∼ CN (0, 1) and E[sis∗

j ] = 0, i (cid:54)= j, the SINR γk of user k can be written as

γk =

pk|h∗

kgk|2

K
(cid:80)
j=1,j(cid:54)=k

pj|h∗

kgj|2 + σ2

.

(4)

Let H = [h1 h2 · · · hK] ∈ CM ×K denote the channel matrix between the BS and K users.

Then, the CB precoder is

and the ZF precoder is

GCB = βCBH,

GZF = βZFH(H∗H)−1,

(5)

(6)

where the scaling factors βCB = (cid:112)P/tr(PH∗H) and βZF = (cid:112)P/tr(P(H∗H)−1) ensure that
the power constraint (2) is met.

By deﬁning ρ = P/σ2 as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and using (5) in (4), the SINR of

the kth user for CB is

(8)

Let Rk ∈ CM ×M be the spatial correlation matrix of user k corresponding to the case of a

stationary channel. Further, let Dk be a diagonal matrix such that if the signal transmitted from

4

only Dk antennas is received by the user k, Dk has Dk non-zero diagonal entries. This diagonal

matrix Dk models the VR of user k. For the proposed channel model, we introduce a matrix

Θk of the form

Θk = D

If zk ∼ CN (0, 1

For stationary channel Dk = I, and Θk = Rk. Therefore, the channel model (10) subsumes the

well known correlated channel studied in [7], [8].

III. LARGE SYSTEM ANALYSIS IN STATIONARY CHANNELS

Correlated stationary channels (i.e., Θk = Rk) were studied in [7], [8], under the following

assumptions.

A1 M, K, M

K → ∞. (BS equipped with a large number of antennas serving a large number of

users.)

A2 The covariance matrices have a uniformly bounded spectral norm i.e., lim sup
M,K→∞

sup
1≤k≤K

(cid:107)Rk(cid:107) =

O(1) [9]. (User channels are not highly correlated.)

A3 The power pmax = max(p1, p2, · · · , pK) is of the order O(1/K), i.e., (cid:107)P(cid:107) = O(1/K).

(Transmission power for all the users is on the same order.)

With A1-A3, the deterministic equivalent of γ(CB)

can be written as [7, eq. 24]

such is not suitable for comparing stationary and non-stationary channels. With this motivation,

we provide a closed form approximate expression in the following theorem.

IV. STATIONARY VERSUS NON-STATIONARITY CHANNELS

For non-stationary channels, we introduce two additional assumptions.

A4 Dk → ∞, ∀k. (Large VR for each user).

A5 lim sup
M,K→∞

sup
1≤k≤K

(cid:107)Θk(cid:107) < ∞. (Non-stationary user channels are not highly correlated.)

With this, the same analysis that led to (11) and (12) can be used for non-stationary channels.

In fact, only R needs to be replaced with Θ in theoretical expressions (11), and (12) to get the

results for the non-stationary case.

For comparison between stationary and non-stationary channels, we make a few simplistic

choices of system and channel parameters. Speciﬁcally, we start by considering pk = P

K ∀k and

Rk = I ∀k. For non-stationary channels, we consider two types of channel normalization.

Normalization 1, tr(Θk) = tr(Rk) = M, ∀k: This ensures that the stationary and non-

stationary channels have the same norm. The physical implication of normalization 1 is shown

in Fig. 1 (a). User terminal 1 (i.e., farther) receives signal from all antennas but with lower

6

power, whereas user terminal 2 (i.e., closer) receives signal from fewer antennas but with higher

power. This is achieved by choosing Dk = diag([0,

(cid:113) M
Dk

1Dk, 0]T).

Normalization 2, tr(Θk) = Dk ∀k: The physical implication of normalization 2 is shown in

Fig. 1 (b). User terminal 1 and 2 are equidistant from the BS, however, user terminal 2 receives
signal from only a few antennas. This is achieved by choosing Dk = diag([0, 1Dk, 0]T).

To further simplify the comparison, we assume that Dk = D ∀k.

(a) Physical implication of normalization 1
i.e., tr(Θ) = M .

(b) Physical implication of normalization 2
i.e., tr(Θ) = D.

Fig. 1: Physical implication of normalization 1 (i.e., tr(Θ) = M ) and normalization 2 (i.e.,
tr(Θ) = D).

We outline the SINR for CB in stationary and non-stationary channels with normalization 1

in detail below. The derivations for normalization 2 and ZF precoding are similar and the results

are summarized in Table I.

The SINR of CB (11) for stationary channels simpliﬁes to

γ(CB)
k − st. =

ρM
ρ(K − 1) + K

.

(14)

For the non-stationary channel under consideration, a user receives the signal transmitted from

D antennas. The indices of these antennas for user k are collected in a set Dk. The SINR of user

k depends on |Dk ∩ Dj| ∀j (cid:54)= k (i.e., inter-user interference). For example, if K = 2, D = M/2

and D1 = D2 = {1, · · · , M/2}, then |D1 ∩ D2| = D and there is high inter-user interference. If,

however, D1 = {1, · · · , M/2} and D2 = {M/2 + 1, · · · , M }, then |D1 ∩ D2| = 0 and there is no

inter-user interference. Thus for non-stationary channels, we consider the best-case (and worst-

case) index sets Dk that result in maximum (and minimum) possible SINR for the considered

setup.

In the worst-case, there is high inter-user interference. This happens, when all the K users

receive the signal from the same D antenna elements. In this case, assuming tr(Θ) = M , it can

γ(CB)

ρM
D (K − 1) + K

ρ M

.

(15)

There is an additional factor M/D in the ﬁrst term in denominator of (15) compared to (14).

Therefore, for worst-case, the smaller the VR of the user (i.e., in this case, the number of active

antennas D), the more SINR loss for non-stationary channels.

In the best-case, there is low inter-user interference for all the K users. The best-case antenna

indices can be found using counting arguments. Asymptotically, with a user k receiving signal

from D antennas, and a total of M antennas, we can arrange only M/D users without any inter-
user interference. If we continue this arrangement for all users, there will be KD

M − 1 interfering

users for any user k. With this observation, the best-case SINR can be written as

γ(CB)
k − non st. (best) =

ρM
ρ(K − M

D ) + K

.

(16)

If KD ≤ M , there will be no inter-user interference with the arrangement described above

and (16) can be further simpliﬁed. Note that the ﬁrst term in the denominator of (14) and (16)
differs. Speciﬁcally, for best-case, if M

D is large (i.e., smaller VR), then the SINR of CB precoders

for non-stationary channels can be better than the stationary channels.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We verify the analysis of the non-stationary channels. We consider M = 60, K = M/2, and

ρ = 10 dB. We plot the SINR results against the active number of antennas per user D. We

consider both the best-case and worst-case antenna conﬁgurations discussed in Section IV. We

plot the results for normalization 1 i.e., tr(Θ) = M in Fig. 2a, and for normalization 2 i.e.,

8

tr(Θ) = D in Fig. 2b. From Fig. 2a, notice that when D is small, the SINR of the non-stationary

channels in the best-case (worst-case) is higher (lower) than the stationary channels. The worst-

case performance loss for CB (ZF) is as high as 15 dB (12.5 dB). As D increases, however,

the SINR in the non-stationary channels converge to the SINR of the stationary channels. This

observation holds for both CB and ZF precoding. The ZF curve in the worst-case starts from

D = 30. For smaller values of D, the channel matrix H is rank deﬁcient and ZF precoding fails.

From Fig. 2b, we notice that with normalization 2, the SINR of the non-stationary channels

is lower than the SINR of the stationary channels (for ρ = 10 dB). With normalization 2, the

performance loss for both CB and ZF can be as high as 15 dB.

(b) Normalization 2: tr(Θ) = D.

VI. CONCLUSION

The VR of the channel impacts the performance of CB and ZF precoders signiﬁcantly. For

small VRs, the post processing SINR loss compared with the stationary channels can be as

high as 15 dB for both CB and ZF. In the best-case, i.e., when the VRs of the users reduce

inter-user interference, the post-processing SINR for both CB and ZF can be higher compared

to a stationary channel. Finally, small VRs can make the channel rank deﬁcient and render the

ZF precoding infeasible.
