late  reverberation,  e.g., 

Abstract—  For  6-DOF  (degrees  of  freedom)  interactive 
virtual acoustic environments (VAEs), the spatial rendering of 
diffuse  late  reverberation  in  addition  to  early  (specular) 
reflections  is  important.  In  the  interest  of  computational 
efficiency, the acoustic simulation of the late reverberation can 
be simplified by using a limited number of spatially distributed 
virtual reverb sources (VRS) each radiating incoherent signals. 
A sufficient number of VRS is needed to approximate spatially 
anisotropic 
in  a  room  with 
inhomogeneous  distribution  of  absorption  at  the  boundaries. 
Here,  a  highly  efficient  and  perceptually  plausible  method  to 
generate  and  spatially  render  late  reverberation  is  suggested, 
extending  the  room  acoustics  simulator  RAZR  [Wendt  et  al., 
J. Audio  Eng.  Soc.,  62,  11  (2014)].  The  room  dimensions  and 
frequency-dependent  absorption  coefficients  at 
the  wall 
boundaries  are  used  to  determine  the  parameters  of  a 
physically-based feedback delay network (FDN) to generate the 
incoherent  VRS  signals.  The  VRS  are  spatially  distributed 
around  the  listener  with  weighting  factors  representing  the 
spatially subsampled distribution of absorption coefficients on 
the wall boundaries. The minimum number of VRS required to 
be perceptually distinguishable from the maximum (reference) 
number  of  96  VRS  was  assessed  in  a  listening  test  conducted 
with  a  spherical  loudspeaker  array  within  an  anechoic  room. 
For  the  resulting  low  numbers  of  VRS  suited  for  spatial 
rendering, optimal physically-based parameter choices for the 
FDN are discussed.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Room  acoustics 

simulation  and  virtual  acoustic 
environments  (VAEs)  enable  the  auralization  of  existing  or 
not  (yet)  existing  spaces  with  applications  ranging  from 
architectural  planning  [1]  to  entertainment  [2].  Because  of 
their potentially high ecological validity [3]–[5], VAEs have 
gained  interest  as  tools  for  psychoacoustic  research  and 
hearing aid development [6]–[9]. 

For many of these applications, computational efficiency 
is  important  to  allow  for  interactive  real-time  updates  with 
6 - DOF  (degrees  of  freedom)  movement  of  sources  and 
receivers.  Thus,  simplifications  of  the  underlying  room 
acoustics simulation and the rendering are desirable. 

This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG 

– Project-ID 352015383 – SFB 1330 C5. 

In  enclosed  spaces,  due  to  reflections  at  boundaries, 
besides direct sound, early reflections and reverberation occur. 
Whereas  individual early reflections might  be  directional  in 
nature, late reverberation results from a superposition of many 
densely  spaced  reflections  that  are  spatially  more  or  less 
evenly  distributed.  Depending  on  room  geometry  and  the 
spatial distribution of sound absorption at the boundaries, the 
late  reverberation  can  be  considered 
resulting  diffuse 
spherically 
limited  spatial 
directivity [10]–[13]. Thus, for room acoustics simulation and 
rendering  of  sound  fields  in  VAEs,  the  spatial  resolution 
required for rendering diffuse late reverberation is of interest. 
Applications focusing on human perception and behavior in 
the VAE might allow for a reduction of spatial resolution for 
late reverberation without altering the perceived sound field, 
enabling simplifications of the simulation and rendering. 

isotropic  or  might  contain 

Room acoustics simulations are often based on geometric 
acoustics in the form of image source models (ISM) [14], [15], 
ray tracing [16], [17], radiosity [18] and radiance transfer [19]. 
Based  on  statistical  assumptions,  computationally  highly 
efficient  reverberation  algorithms 
like  feedback  delay 
networks  (FDN;  [20])  can  be  applied  for  generating 
reverberated  signals  (e.g., [21], [22]). In hybrid  approaches, 
simplified  statistical  methods,  which  fulfill  perceptual 
requirements  for  late  reverberation  can  be  combined  with 
more accurate geometric acoustic models for early reflections. 
An  ISM  for  early reflections and  raytracing  to  calculate the 
spatiotemporal energy distribution of scattered reflections and 
late  reverberation  were  combined  in  [23].  An  ISM  and  a 
spatialized FDN for late reverberation were combined in [24]. 
Perceptual evaluations in  [25] showed that a high degree of 
perceptual  plausibility  can  be  achieved  with  current  room 
acoustics simulation methods. 

The spatial resolution of late reverberation simulation and 
rendering  is  determined  by  the  number  of  (incoherent)  late 
reverberation signals which are spatially mapped around the 
listener.  Such  virtual  reverberation  sources  (VRS)  can  be 
played back by individual loudspeakers in an array. For VRS 
at  positions  differing  from  those  of  physically  available 
loudspeakers  in  a  given  array,  VRS  can  be  rendered  to 
multiple  loudspeakers  using  vector-base  amplitude  panning 
(VBAP;  [26]),  or  spherical-harmonics-based  approaches 
(Ambisonics;  [27],  [28]).  Using  these  methods,  a  diffuse 
sound  field  can  be  approximated  by  superposition  of 
incoherent  sounds  from  many  directions  (for  a  review  of 

 
 
theoretical  approaches  see,  e.g.,  [29]).  Regarding 
the 
perception of diffuse sound fields, [30] found that a specific 
horizontal  arrangement  of  only  four  loudspeakers  separated 
by  90°  can  already  be  sufficient  to  reproduce  the  spatial 
impression of a diffuse sound field. With such a low number 
of loudspeakers, however, the results were strongly dependent 
on  the  rotation  of  the  loudspeaker  array  with  regard  to  the 
listener.  This  is  problematic  in  VAE  applications,  where 
listeners can freely rotate their head in the array. 

profile  matching 

In the room acoustics simulator (RAZR; [24]), incoherent 
late reverberation signals are generated as output of an FDN 
and used to drive a limited number of VRS which are spatially 
evenly  distributed  on  a  listener-centred  cube.  Alternatively, 
other approaches use, e.g., incoherent decaying noises with a 
spectral 
frequency-dependent 
reverberation time RT60 as filters to drive a limited number of 
VRS.  While  in  the  case  of  a  completely  homogeneous 
distribution  of  absorption  coefficients  at  all  boundaries  an 
isotropic late reverberant field has to be approximated with a 
limited  number  of  VRS,  the  more  critical  case  regarding 
spatial  resolution  of  late  reverberation,  however,  is  an 
inhomogeneous distribution of absorption coefficients, like an 
opening at one side of a room or one highly absorbing wall. 

the 

In  the  current  study,  a  computationally  highly  efficient 
method  to  generate  and  spatially  render  isotropic  and 
ansiotropic  late  reverberation  is  suggested.  For  simplicity  a 
“proxy” shoebox approximation of room geometry is used in 
the context of the room acoustics simulator RAZR. The spatial 
resolution  required  for  rendering  late  reverberation  was 
assessed in a simulated room with one highly absorbing wall 
covering different solid angles or field of view (FOV) from 
the listener position. The number of VRS was varied from low 
spatial resolution (6 VRS) to high spatial resolution (96 VRS). 
A simplistic, highly efficient spatial subsampling method was 
suggested  to  map  the  spatial  distribution  of  reflection 
coefficients  at  the room  boundaries  to  weighting  factors  for 
the VRS. A 3-dimensional, 86-channel loudspeaker array was 
used for rendering. The VRS as well as direct sound and early 
specular  reflections  up  to  the  third  reflection  order  were 
mapped to the loudspeaker array using VBAP. For technical 
evaluation, the coherence between the two ears of a dummy 
head in the sound field generated by the loudspeaker array was 
analyzed.  Interaural  coherence  is  considered  relevant  for 
psychoacoustic processes (e.g., [31], [32]) and also has been 
suggested  to  assess  the  reproduction  of  diffuse  sound  fields 
(e.g.,  [30],  [33]).  In  addition,  the  frequency-dependent 
interaural 
(ILD)  was  assessed.  A 
psychoacoustic experiment with normal-hearing listeners was 
conducted  to  investigate  whether  listeners  can  discriminate 
renderings  with  a  lower  number  of  VRS  from  the  highest 
available number of 96 VRS, which served as a reference.

II.  ROOM ACOUSTICS SIMULATION 

A.  Basic method 

RAZR [24] generates perceptually plausible room impulse 
responses  (RIRs)  using  a  hybrid  ISM/FDN  approach.  To 
achieve  high  computational  efficiency,  the  ISM  uses  a 
shoebox approximation of room geometry. By default, RAZR 
computes discrete early (specular) reflections up to the third 
reflection order in the ISM. The reverberation tail is generated 
by  a  12-channel  FDN  which  is  fed  by  the  last  order  of 
reflections from the ISM. The output channels of the FDN are 
used as VRS that are spatially mapped to the same number of 

discrete locations on a listener centered cube, aligned with the 
six  walls  of  the  “proxy”  shoebox  room  (reverberation  cube 
mapping). In this default setting, the spatial resolution of the 
late  reverberation  is  a  result  of  12  discrete  directions 
(2 representing each wall) spatially evenly distributed around 
the listener. The frequency-dependent absorption coefficients 
of each of the 6 walls determines a wall-specifc “absorption 
filter” which is applied to the respective 2 FDN outputs in the 
2 VRS representing each wall. Perceptual plausibility of the 
resulting  room  acoustics  simulations  was  demonstrated  by 
favorable performance in comparison to other state-of-the-art 
approaches in ([25], see their Fig. 8).  

B.  Suggested extensions 

To  assess 

the  required  spatial  resolution  of 

late 
reverberation  rendering,  in  the  current  study  RAZR  was 
adapted to generate either 6, 12, 24, 48, or 96 VRS, equivalent 
to 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 VRS per surface of the underlying shoebox 
room.  To  ensure  similar  spectro-temporal  characteristics  of 
the  FDN  output  throughout  evaluation  and  avoiding  timbre 
changes in the resulting reverberant tail due to a variation of 
the  number  of  FDN  channels  ([34],  [35]),  the  FDN  always 
operated with the highest number of 96 channels, independent 
of the number of rendered VRS.  The 96  FDN outputs  were 
directly used for 96 VRS and the spatial resolution of the late 
reverberation  was adjusted by using a set of downmixes for 
48, 24, 12, and 6 VRS generated in a sequential procedure by 
adding  pairs  of  the  FDN  output  channels.  The  VRS  were 
spatially distributed according to the directions of vertices of 
polyhedra,  centred  on  the  listener  and  directionally  aligned 
with  the  (shoebox)  room  boundaries.  The  polyhedra  had  a 
number of vertices equivalent to the number of VRS and were 
optimized for sphericity [36], which ranged from 0.86 for 6 
VRS to 0.99 for 96 VRS. For 6 VRS, the resulting directions 
are orthogonal to each other and for 12 VRS they correspond 
to  points  lying  on  the  diagonals  of  the  surfaces  of  a  room 
aligned cube (similar  to  the  original  alignment  suggested  in 
[24]).  Directions  for  24  and  more  VRS  were  based  on  a 
combination of 1, 2, and 4 snub cuboctahedra (snub cubes). 

In rooms with an inhomogeneous distribution of acoustic 
absorption, e.g., a  shoebox room  with one highly  absorbent 
wall  and  otherwise  more  reflective  walls,  anisotropic  late 
reverberation  will  occur.  The  spatial  distribution  of  late 
reverberation  depends  on  the  distance  of  the  listener  to  the 
absorbing  wall,  affecting  the  solid  angle  (or  field  of  view, 
FOV) occupied by the wall. In the extreme case of a listener 
very close to one completely absorbing wall, no reverberant 
sound energy impinges from the hemisphere occupied by the 
absorbing  wall.  To  cope  with  the  general  case  of  different 
arbitrary  absorption  coefficients  per  wall  (representing  the 
average  absorption  coefficient  of 
the  room  geometry 
approximated by the walls of the proxy shoebox room), RAZR 
was  extended  by  a  spatial  sampling  routine  to  calculate  the 
absorption filters applied to each of the VRS. Dependent on 
the  listener’s  position  in  relation  to  the  boundaries,  the 
resulting FOV occupied by each boundary and the direction 
of the VRS in relation to the boundaries, the contribution of 
the absorption coefficients to the absorption filter at the FDN 
output for the respective VRS were blended.

with particular boundary surfaces of the room. Inner circle: simple assignment of VRS to a certain boundary based on projection. Outer circle: smooth weighted 
assignment based on warping on the VRS directions. Right panels: VRS positions (black crosses) and directions of the room corners (dash-dotted lines) before 
warping (mid-right) and after warping (right-most). 

Fig. 1 shows a 2-dimensional representation of an example 
case  for  a  number  of  48  VRS  (left-most  panel)  and  8  VRS 
(mid-left  panel)  in  the  horizontal  plane.  Here,  an  elongated 
room is shown and the receiver is placed close to the upper 
+y wall.  Red  and  blue  indicate  the  vertical  and  horizontal 
walls, respectively, as well as their associated attributes. The 
black  dashed  lines  are  along  the  x  and  y  directions  and 
coincide with the (axis-aligned) wall normals. The inner circle 
of  red  and  blue  colored  crosses  shows  a  straight-forward 
approach  where  the  absorption  coefficients  of  a  respective 
walls  are  directly  projected  onto  the  VRS.  While  this 
simplistic  approach  appears  feasible  for  a  high  number  of 
VRS  (left-most  panel),  it  is  unsuited  for  lower  numbers  of 
VRS (mid-left panel), where the lower -y wall would not be 
represented. Thus, an efficient spatial sub-sampling has to be 
devised.  Additionally,  smooth  transitions  are  desired  for 
dynamic  environments,  in which  the  receiver can  move.  To 
achieve a smooth sampling for arbitrary number and positions 
of VRS, the space around the receiver position was divided in 
octants  (quadrants  in  the  depicted  2-dimensional  case  in 
Fig. 1, as indicated by the dashed lines). In each octant, the 
VRS direction vectors (from receiver to VRS) were divided 
elementwise by the vector from  the receiver  to  the  shoebox 
corner (vertex) contained in the octant, and then normalized. 
The  resulting  warped  VRS  position  of  index  k  can  be 
expressed as 

VRS⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ w,k =

VRS⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ k ⊘ 𝑉⃗ n,abs
‖𝑉𝑅𝑆⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ k ⊘ 𝑉⃗ n,abs‖

, 

(1) 

where VRS⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ k = [𝑥𝑘 𝑦𝑘 𝑧𝑘]  is  the  original  VRS  position, 
⊘  is  the  Hadamard  (elementwise)  division  operator,  and 
𝑉⃗ n,abs  is  the  vector  of  absolute  values  of  the  room  vertex 
coordinates  relative  to  the  receiver  in  the  octant  n.  This 
transformation warps the vectors from the receiver to the eight 
vertices of the shoebox to represent a receiver-centred cube. 
Likewise, all k VRS directions are warped in such a way that 
a VRS on the room corner appears exactly on the according 
cube vertex. The two panels on the right-hand side of Fig. 1 
(mid-right: before  warping, right-most:  after  warping)  show 
the  depicted  2-dimensional 
the  effect  of  warping 
representation.  The  dash-dotted  lines  to  the  edges  (vertices) 
appear under an angle of 45° exactly on the diagonals between 
the normals of the two walls in each quadrant after warping 
(right-most panel). 

in 

Using the warped VRS directions, the contributions of the 
reflection coefficients of each of the orthogonal shoebox walls 

are  calculated  using  VBAP  with  the  inverted  (outside-
pointing)  wall  normals  as  vector  base.  Eq.  18  from  [26]  is 
therefore adapted to yield the contribution 𝑔k = [𝑔1 𝑔2 𝑔3] of 
the  absorption  coefficients  of  the  three  intersecting  walls  in 
each octant with the normal vectors 𝑛1, 𝑛2, 𝑛3 to the filtering 
applied to a particular VRS with index k: 

𝑔k = VRS⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ w,k  [

𝑛1,x 𝑛1,y 𝑛1,z
𝑛2,x 𝑛2,y 𝑛2,z
𝑛3,x 𝑛3,y 𝑛3,z

−1

]

 . 

(2) 

For  an  axis-aligned  shoebox  room, 𝑔k  simplifies  to  the 
absolute  values  of  each  element  of  VRS⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗⃗ w,k .  The  resulting 
spatially  (sub-)  sampled  absorption  coefficient 𝑎k (typically 
computed for multiple frequencies) which serves as a basis for 
designing the absorption filter for each VRS is 

𝑎k = 𝑔k  [

𝛼1
𝛼2
𝛼3

] , 

(3) 

where  𝛼1, 𝛼2, 𝛼3  are  the  absorption  coefficients  of  the 
respective walls in the octant. Following this method, a VRS 
at  a  room  corner  receives  an  identical  contribution  from  all 
three walls (two in the depicted 2-dimensional case). In a case 
where the listener is close to a highly absorbent boundary, the 
corresponding  VRS  in  the  FOV,  defined  by  the  “view” 
frustum from the receiver to the four shoebox vertices of the 
boundary now  emits significantly less energy than the other 
VRS, mimicking that no or reduced sound energy in the late 
reverberant field can emerge from that boundary. The further 
the  listener  moves  away  from  the  absorbent  boundary,  the 
smaller  the  surface’s  FOV and  the  fewer  VRS are affected. 
Depending  on  the  overall  number  of  VRS,  the  spatial 
resolution  with  which  the  absorbing  boundary,  as  observed 
from  the  listener  position,  is  spatially  sampled  by  the  VRS 
directions is reduced. This results in an increasingly blurred 
spatial representation with decreasing number of VRS. 

It is assumed that the highest number of 96 VRS applied 
here is sufficiently high to serve as a reference condition for 
evaluation of spatial resolution of late reverberation with all 
96 FDN channels mapped to separate VRS. 

III.  EVALUATION SETUP 

A.  Virtual Room 

A corridor (Fig. 2) with the dimensions 24 m x 8 m x 6 m 
and inhomogeneous absorption coefficients was used for the 
evaluation of the proposed method. One of the small surfaces 

Fig. 2.  Virtual Corridor. Source positions are denoted by crosses, receiver 
positions and orientation by the nosed balls. The highly absorbing surface is 
shaded. The distances to highly absorbing surface were chosen so that the 
horizontal FOV was approximately 170°, 110°, 70° and 30° for position A, 
B, C, and D, respectively. 

(shaded) at the end of the corridor was highly absorbent (α = 
0.99 for all frequencies), while all other surfaces were quite 
reflective  (α  =  0.01  to  0.11  from  125  Hz  to  8  kHz).  The 
resulting  RT60  ranged  from  approx.  1.3  s  to  0.8  s  in  the 
frequency range from 125 Hz to 8 kHz. Four source-receiver-
position combinations were considered to vary the solid angle 
(or FOV) occupied by the highly absorbing wall and thus the 
spatial features of the resulting anisotropic late reverberation. 
Source and receiver were always aligned on an axis parallel to 
the highly absorbent surface, and were located at a height of 
1.8 m above the floor and 1.33 m from the sidewalls, resulting 
in a fixed source-receiver distance of 5.33 m. There were four 
source-receiver  combinations  at  different  distances  to  the 
highly absorbing wall, so that a wide range of different FOVs 
of  the  absorbent  wall  is  obtained.  The  default  receiver 
orientation  was  towards  the  sound  source  (azimuth  angle 
of 0°) for all combinations (denoted A to D, see also Fig. 2). 

B.  Loudspeaker Array Rendering 

The room acoustic simulations of the corridor, composed 
of the discrete early reflections and the (varying number) of 
VRS were rendered using VBAP to a spherical 3-dimensional, 
86-channel loudspeaker array (Genelec 8030 c/b), mounted in 
a  7  m  x  9  m  x  7  m  anechoic  chamber  with  0.75  m  foam 
wedges. The radius of the array is 2.5 m. The loudspeakers are 
inhomogeneously arranged in five rings at - 60°, -30 °, 0°, 30°, 
60°  elevation  and  two  additional  loudspeakers  below  and 
above  the  center  point  (-90°,  90°  elevation).  The  azimuthal 
spacing of loudspeakers is 7.5° in the horizontal ring and 30° 
and  60°  respectively  in  the  rings  outside  of  the  horizontal 
plane. The simulated RIRs that have been spatialized for the 
loudspeaker  array  are  referred  to  as  multichannel  room 
impulse  responses  (MRIRs)  in  the  following.  Due  to  path 
differences  between  the  loudspeakers  contributing  in  the 
rendering of a VRS and the listener’s ears, spectral coloration 
artefacts  can  occur  when  using  VBAP.  In  RAZR,  these  are 
accounted  for  with  filtering  based  on  a  statistical  approach 
described in [37]. 

IV.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION 

Interaural coherence and interaural level difference (ILD) 
were estimated using the FABIAN HRTF database [38] in the 
late reverberant sound field (disregarding early reflections and 
direct sound) rendered using the loudspeaker topology of the 
86-channel  loudspeaker  array.  For  this  technical  evaluation, 
independent Gaussian noises were used as output of the VRS, 
which received the weights according to the suggested spatial 
sampling method. 

Fig. 3.  Interaural  coherence  (left  column)  and  interaural  level  difference 
(right column) for 6 to 96 VRS (top to bottom) and different positions in the 
corridor  as  indicated  in  the  legend.  The  dotted  yellow  trace  shows  the 
approximation of an isotropic sound field with varying number of VRS in 
the current setup. For reference the results for 96 VRS for position A and D 
are displayed by less saturated thick lines in all panels. 

The  frequency-dependent 

interaural  coherence  (IC) 
estimates 𝐶𝑙𝑟(𝑓) between the signals l and r in both ears were 
calculated according to: 

𝐶𝑙𝑟(𝑓) = ℜ (

𝐺𝑙𝑟(𝑓)
√𝐺𝑙𝑙(𝑓)𝐺𝑟𝑟(𝑓)

). 

(4) 

where f denotes the frequency, ℜ is the real-part operator and 
G represents the spectral density estimate according to Welch. 
The  calculations  were  performed  for  consecutive  windows 
with a 75 % overlap and a length of 512 samples at 44.1 kHz 
sampling  rate  to  obtain  an  average  coherence  estimate.  The 
Gaussian noise VRS signals were 60 s in duration. 

The  ILD  was  calculated  from  the  same  simulated  ear 

signals l and r like above as 

ILD(𝑓) = 10  log10

numbers of VRS (top to bottom) for position A (close to the 
absorbing  wall)  and  position  D  (furthest  away  from  the 
absorbing  wall).  Intermediate  results  are  observed  for 
positions B and C which are not shown for clarity. The dotted 
yellow trace represents the approximation of the isotropic case 
in  the  current  rendering  setup  with  the  same  output  power 
assigned  to  all  VRS  instead  of  the  suggested  weighting 
according  to  the  inhomogeneous  distribution  of  absorption 
coefficients  at  the  boundaries.  The  results  for  positions

A and D for 96 VRS are shown for comparison in all panels 
(less  saturated  thick  traces).  For  6  VRS  (top  panel),  large 
deviations  from  the  96  VRS  condition  are  obserKirsch  et 
al.ved above about 400 Hz and no difference is obtained for 
positions A and D. For an increasing number of VRS, the IC 
gradually asymptotes against that obtained for 96 VRS with 
deviations only occurring at increasingly higher frequencies. 
Tab. 1  shows  the  upper  frequency  limit  above  which  larger 
deviations occur. Differences between position A and D also 
become are increasingly like those observed for 96 VRS with 
increasing  number  of  VRS.  Overall,  as  shown  for  the 
“reference” case of 96 VRS, only small differences in IC for 
positions  A  and  D  are  observed,  although  no  sound  energy 
impinges from one hemisphere in position A. In position D the 
results already are virtually identical with those observed for 
the isotropic case (dashed).

numbers of VRS and all positions A to D. Generally, ILDs are 
largest  for  position  A  (close  to  the  absorbent  wall)  and 
decrease to near zero for the farthest position D, similar to the 
ILD  observed  for  the  approximation  of  the  isotropic  case 
(dashed).  Remaining  small  ILDs  are  to  be  attributed  to  the 
HRTF-database used for simulation  and the selection of the 
nearest-neighbor directions in the database (according to the 
loudspeaker directions in the array). Again, large deviations 
from  96  VRS  are  mainly  observed  for  6  VRS  where  the 
maximum  ILD  for  position  D  (up  to  5  dB)  in  the  depicted 
8 kHz range is considerably smaller than for 96 VRS (up to 
8 dB).  For  12  VRS,  a  larger  maximum  ILD  compared  to 
96 VRS (of up to 10 dB) is observed, and the results for larger 
numbers of VRS gradually asymptote against those observed 
for  96  VRS.  The  right-hand  columns  in  Tab. 1  indicate  the 
upper  frequency  limit  of  reasonable  agreement  with  the  96 
VRS case for A and D, which increases for increasing number 
of VRS. 

 In  Fig. 4,  IC  (left  column)  and  ILD  (right  column)  are 
displayed for different receiver orientations to assess the effect 
of  rotational  movements  in  the  VAE.  The  orientation  of  0° 
(replot of traces from Fig. 3) refers to the orientation indicated 
in  Fig. 2.  Orientations  of  30°  (dashed)  and  60°  (dotted)  are 
clockwise rotations towards the corridor. It is obvious that IC 
in the left column is independent of rotation up to a frequency 
limit which increases with the number of VRS. For 6 VRS, IC 
for different rotations starts diverging around 500 Hz, whereas 
this frequency is about 900 Hz for 12 VRS, 2000 Hz for 24 
VRS, and 3000 Hz for 48 and 96 VRS. The ILDs depicted in 
the left column of Fig. 4 show that for any number higher than 
6  VRS,  there  are  no  major  deviations  in  ILD  depending  on 
orientation  for  the  near-isotropic  position  D.  An  overall 
similar behavior is observed for all orientations for more than 
6 VRS at position A. For 6 VRS, strong deviations from 96 
VRS are observed for all orientations. 

In  summary,  the  technical  evaluation  shows  a  large 
deviation for 6 VRS from the higher numbers of VRS. The IC 
in the perceptually relevant range up to 1.5 kHz (e.g., [39]–

Fig. 4. Interaural  coherence  (left  column)  and  interaural  level  difference 
(right  column)  for  6  to  96  VRS  (top  to  bottom)  for  different  receiver 
orientation.  0°  refers  to  the  orientation  indicated  in  Fig.  2  (replot  from 
Fig. 3). 30° and 60° are a clockwise rotation towards the corridor. 

[41])  is  well  approximated  for  24  VRS  and  more,  while 
12 VRS still show deviations above about 750 Hz (especially 
when  receiver  rotation  is  considered).  However,  these 
deviations  mainly  occur  for  small  coherence  values  where 
perceptual discrimination is poor (e.g., [42]). Regarding ILDs, 
a good approximation is also obtained for 24 VRS and more. 
For 6 VRS, considerably smaller ILDs compared to 96 VRS 
are observed, while for 12 VRS larger ILDs are observed. 

V.  PERCEPTUAL EVALUATION 

A.  Method 

1) Listeners: 6 listeners (3 female, 3 male) were recruited 
amongst students at the University of Oldenburg. They were 
between  21  and  28  years  old.  All  were  tested  for  normal 
hearing by means of pure tone audiometry (Hearing threshold 
≤ 25 dB HL between 125 Hz and 8 kHz). All subjects reported 
varying amounts of experience with listening tests. 

2)  Stimuli:  MRIRs  were  generated  for  the  four  source-
receiver conditions A-D (see Fig. 1) with varying numbers of 
6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 VRS but unaltered early reflections for 
each of the positions. A transient stimulus referred to as pink 
pulse was chosen as a source signal for convolution with the 
MRIRs. The signal was generated as a digital delta pulse that 
was subsequently filtered in order to achieve a pink spectrum 
(sampling rate 44.1 kHz, decay from 0 dB FS to -60 dB FS in 
36  ms).  The  pink  pulse  provides  listeners  with  a  highly 
consistent  percept  that  due  to  its  transient  nature  can  be 

 
 
 
 
assumed to result in high sensitivity to alterations in the spatial 
rendering of the reverberant decay. 

3) Apparatus and Procedure: Listeners were seated on a 
fixed (non-rotating) chair in the center of the above described 
86-channel spherical loudspeaker array.  

A  computer  monitor  was  placed  straight  ahead  of  the 
listeners in a distance of 2.5 m in order to inform them about 
the progress of the experiment and to provide a fixed direction 
for default head orientation and gaze prior to the presentation 
of the stimulus. The listeners’ head movement was, however, 
neither  constrained  nor  monitored,  enabling  natural  head 
movements  during  listening.  Listeners  used  a  wireless 
keyboard  on  their  lap  so  that  responses  could  be  provided 
without looking at the controls. 

For the listening tests, an ABX paradigm was used. The 
reference rendering with the maximum number of 96 VRS and 
the  rendering  under  test  (with  lower  number  of  VRS)  were 
presented randomly as either A and B of the sequence. X was 
randomly  chosen  to  be  either the reference or the  rendering 
under  test.  Test  subjects  had  to  determine  whether  X  was 
perceived to be similar to A or B in terms of spatial properties. 

The procedure was separated into 4 runs that each covered 
a particular room condition. Listeners had the opportunity to 
take  short  breaks  in  between  runs.  20  presentations  per 
number  of  VRS  resulted  in  80  ABX  trials  per  run.  One 
experimental  run  took  about  10  minutes.  Listeners  did  not 
receive  any  feedback  on  the  correctness  of  their  responses. 
Prior  to  the  listening  test,  audiometry  and  a  familiarization 
phase were performed. The familiarization phase consisted of 
the presentation of four ABX trials with 6 and 12 VRS. During 
the familiarization phase,  listeners received feedback on the 
correctness  of  their  responses.  The  experimental  procedure, 
except  for  the  audiometry,  was  repeated  in  an  additional 
session on a different day resulting in overall 40 presentations 
per VRS number. 

B.  Results 

Fig. 4  shows  the  average  discrimination  results  between 
conditions with fewer VRS as indicated on the x-axis and the 
reference condition with 96 VRS. The order of the boxes and 
colors  indicate  the  room  conditions  with  different  distance 
from  the  absorbing  wall  (left  to  right:  A-D,  large  to  small 
FOV) as indicated in the legend, grouped by the number of 
VRS. 

A fairly narrow distribution of the results can be observed 
with 6 VRS  for  all positions. For  these  stimuli,  all  listeners 
responded correctly in at least 95 % of the trials. For 12 VRS, 
there  is  a  wider  spread  for  all  positions  with  individual 
performance  ranging  between  52.5 %  and  87.5 %  correct 
responses.  A generally  wide performance range  can  also be 
observed  for  24  and  48  VRS,  but  with  lower  medians 
compared to 12 VRS. A consistent dependency on the position 
within the room (A-D) is not obvious. 

A two-way repeated-measures was performed to assess the 
effect  of  the  number  of  VRS  and  position  in  the  room.  A 
significant  main  effect  was  found  for  the  number  of  VRS 
[F(3, 15) = 288.87, p < 0.001]. No significant main effect of 
the  position  [F(3, 15)  =  0.64,  p  =  0.36]  and  no  significant 
interaction  [F(9,45)  =  1.18,  p  =  0.49]  were  found.  Post-hoc 
pair-wise  comparisons  (Bonferroni)  revealed  significant 
differences between the conditions with 6 VRS compared to 
all other conditions as well as between 12 VRS and all other

range and the horizontal  red  lines  within  the  boxes  represent the median. 
Whiskers denote highest or lowest value within 1.5 times the interquartile 
range from the box edge. Any values outside of this range were classified as

are  represented  by  different  colors  of  the  boxes.  Along  the  x-axis,  the 
number of VRS is denoted. The three horizontal lines indicate the chance

conditions. No  significant  difference  was found between 24 
and 48 VRS. 

Taken together, the listening test indicates that for the pink 
pulse stimulus and the corridor tested in the current study, a 
minimum  of  24  VRS  appears  sufficient  to  render  the  late 
reverberation. 

VI.  DISCUSSION  

A  computationally  efficient  method  to  render 
late 
reverberation  in  rooms  with  inhomogeneously  distributed 
absorption  coefficients  was  proposed,  extending 
the 
perceptually  plausible  room  acoustics  simulator  (RAZR, 
[24]). The technical and perceptual evaluation showed that a 
relatively  low  number  of  24  spatially  equally  distributed 
virtual sources to auralize late reverberation approximates the 
reference  condition  with  96  VRS  sufficiently  well.  With 
relaxed criteria, depending on the application, 12 VRS might 
also be sufficient. Thus, computational cost for simulating late 
reverberation  and  demands  for  spatially  rendering  late 
reverberation can be kept low, which is particularly important 
in  the  context  of  real-time  VAEs.  Although  listening  tests 
were  conducted  with  a  specific  room  acoustics  simulation 
method  using  an  FDN,  the  current  results  will  apply  to 
different simulations methods for late reverberation, provided 
a number of incoherent late reverberation signals is generated. 

A.  Limitations of the suggested warping-based spatial 

subsampling method 
The 

suggested 

direction-warping-based 

spatial 
subsampling  method  to  derive  weights  for  the  blending  of 
different  absorption coefficients at  the room boundaries  can 
be efficiently applied using only vector-based operations for 
the  warping  and  the  well-established  VBAP  method  for 
blending.  Moreover,  for  an  axis-aligned  “proxy”  shoebox 
room  (orthogonal  walls),  VBAP  simplifies  to  just  using  the 
absolute values of the corresponding elements of the warped 
VRS 
reducing 
octant), 
computational complexity. 

dramatically 

vectors 

(per 

For  low  numbers of  VRS and  when  the direction of  the 
VRS coincide with the surface normal, which form the vector 
base for VBAP in each octant, the method becomes invariant 
to the FOV under which a boundary occurs. This is obvious in 
the current study for 6 VRS, where, e.g., the IC is independent 
of position (see Fig. 3, position A and D). The method can be 
further  improved,  mainly  for  low  numbers  of  VRS,  by 
integrating an estimate of the FOV of each boundary and the 
average  FOV  covered  by  each  VRS.  However,  relevant 
improvements  would  be mainly observed  in  position  D and 
for  the  lowest  number  of  6  VRS,  which  cannot  be 
recommended for application in VAEs, anyhow. 

Furthermore,  the  current  method  is  based  on  a  “proxy” 
shoebox  room  approximation  of 
the  underlying  room 
geometry,  which  already  represents  spatially  averaged 
absorption  coefficients  in  six  orthogonal  directions.  Future 
developments for arbitrary geometry can be based on image 
down-sampling methods after projection and rendering of the 
environment  to  a  cube  or  spherical  map,  as  applied  in 
computer graphics/vision. 

B.  Physically-based parameter choices for the FDN 

The current results indicate that a relatively low number of 
24  VRS  is  sufficient  to  render  late  reverberation.  For  high 
computational  efficiency  an  according  low  number  of  FDN 
channels is desirable. The lower the number of FDN channels, 
the more pronounced recurrent temporal features occur in the 
FDN  output.  To  avoid  any  perceptual  difference  due  to 
varying the number of FDN channels as such, in the current 
study,  the  number  of  FDN  channels  was  kept  fixed  at  96, 
independent of the number of VRS. For real-time applications, 
a perceptually optimal choice  of  FDN parameters  for  a  low 
number  of  FDN  channels  has  to  be  found.  While  several 
studies optimized FDNs using, e.g., time-varying parameters 
or optimization of mode density (e.g., [43], [34]), RAZR uses 
a physically-based design of the FDN, where the delays are 
derived  from  the  dimensions  of  the  room.  This  is  also 
motivated by interpreting the FDN as a rough approximation 
of  radiance  transfer  [44].  The  current  default  settings  as 
suggested  and  evaluated  in  [24]  use  12  VRS  for  lowest 
computational complexity. According to the current finding, 
an  optimal  representation  of  random  sound  directions 
travelling through the room has to be found for 24 VRS. This 
higher number allows for a better sampling of the distribution 
of  sound  travelling  times  between  two  boundaries  as,  e.g., 
calculated from radiance transfer.  

C.  Relation of technical and perceptual evaluation and 

outlook 
The observations of the technical evaluation with accurate 
representation of the IC up to at least 1.5 kHz for 24 and more 
VRS and small deviations in the ILD for 24 and more VRS 
are in line with the absence of any significant differences for 
24  and  more  VRS 
the  perceptual  discrimination 
experiment.  With  respect  to  recommendations  for  spatial 
resolution of late reverberation in VAEs, 24 VRS thus appear 
sufficient both from the technical and the perceptual side. 

in 

However, differences to 12 VRS are not large. Moreover, 
it  can  be  assumed  that  other  source  signals  like  speech  or 
random  noise  bursts  are  less  critical  for  the  perceptual 
evaluation  than  the  here  employed  pulse  stimulus,  and 
requirements for  late reverberation  might  be  further  relaxed 
depending on the targeted application. The effect of receiver 
orientation  was  only  assessed  in  the  technical  evaluation, 

however, it appears plausible that the lowest number of 6 VRS 
will  also  lead  to  large  perceptual  deviations  from  higher 
numbers  of  VRS  and  can  be  considered  unsuited  for  in  the 
context of VAEs, where a 6-DOF movement of the receiver is 
generally desired. Furthermore, for a more complete picture 
also  on  the  side  of  the  technical  evaluation,  future  research 
could  be  extended  to  separately  assess  the  effects  of  the 
number  of  VRS  and  the  topology  of  the  loudspeaker  array, 
additionally considering isotropic cases. For the use of VAEs 
in the context of an ecologically valid evaluation of hearing 
aids or hearing supportive devices, a technical assessment of 
two receivers spaced at typical multi-microphone distances of 
ear-level devices appears relevant. 

VII. CONCLUSION 

A  highly  efficient  method  for  rendering  anisotropic  late 
reverberation for VAEs via a limited number of VRS has been 
proposed. For a “proxy” shoebox representation of arbitrary 
room geometry, the (average) absorption coefficients assigned 
to each boundary are smoothly mapped to a desired number 
spatially equally distributed VRS, depending on the receiver 
position in the room. For an axis-aligned proxy shoebox, the 
reduced  and 
required  operations  can  be 
computational  efficiency 
improved.  Technical 
evaluation  in  terms  of  IC  and  ILD  suggests  that  across 
multiple  positions  in  a  room  with  strongly  inhomogeneous 
absorption  properties,  a  number  of  24  VRS  can  suffice  for 
accurate reproduction in 6-DOF applications. A listening test 
confirmed this result. Further reduction of the number of VRS 
may be possible in certain applications.
