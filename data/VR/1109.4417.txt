ABSTRACT
In a disc galaxy the distribution of azimuthal components of velocity is very skew. In the past
this skewness has been modelled by superposed Gaussians. We use dynamical arguments to
derive an analytic formula that can be ﬁtted to observed velocity distributions, and validate it
by ﬁts to the velocities derived from a dynamically rigorous model, and to a sample of local
stars with accurate space velocities. Our formula is much easier to use than a full distribu-
tion function. It has fewer parameters than a multi-Gaussian ﬁt, and the best-ﬁtting model
parameters give insight into the underlying disc dynamics. In particular, once the azimuthal
velocities of a sample have been successfully ﬁtted, the apparatus provides a prediction for
the corresponding distribution of radial velocities vR. An eﬀective formula like ours is invalu-
able when ﬁtting to data for stars at some distance from the Sun because it enables one to
make proper allowance for the errors in distance and proper motion when determining the
underlying disc kinematics. The derivation of our formula elucidates the way the horizontal
and vertical motions are closely intertwined, and makes it evident that no stellar population
can have a scale height and vertical velocity dispersions that are simultaneously independent
of radius. We show that the oscillation of a star perpendicular to the Galactic plane modiﬁes
the eﬀective potential in which the star moves radially in such a way that the more vertical
energy a star has, the larger is the mean radius of its orbit.

1 INTRODUCTION

Currently considerable eﬀort is being invested in surveys of the
solar neighbourhood. Fifteen years ago the study of nearby stars
was revived by the Hipparcos mission, which pioneered space as-
trometry. Hipparcos put ground-based astrometry onto a more se-
cure foundation, so now useful proper motions are available for
tens of millions of stars. In the last decade the proper motions have
been complemented by photometric surveys, both in the infrared
and to fainter magnitudes at optical wavelengths. Finally, the RAVE
(Steinmetz et al. 2005) and SEGUE (see York et al. 2000; Yanny
et al. 2009) surveys have measured nearly a million line-of-sight
velocities.

As a result of these major observational programmes, it is be-
coming possible to determine the velocity distribution within the
disc of our Galaxy, not only at the location of the Sun, but also at
signiﬁcant distances, especially at higher Galactic latitudes. Nat-
urally one wants to quantify the velocity distribution observed at
some location x in the Galaxy in an eﬃcient way. Conventionally
one does this by imagining that the density of stars in velocity space
forms a “velocity ellipsoid” – a triaxial ellipsoidal region of over-

density in velocity space. If the Galaxy were axisymmetric (which
is a reasonable ﬁrst approximation), we would expect that in the
Galactic plane the principal axes of the the velocity ellipsoid would
be aligned with the coordinate directions of cylindrical polar coor-
dinates, (R, z, φ). As one moves above the plane, two of the princi-
pal axes of the velocity ellipsoid are expected to tip slightly with
respect to the ˆR and ˆz directions. Let the components of velocity
parallel to these principal axes be denoted v1 and v2, where v1 →
vR
0. The third axis is expected to remain aligned
and v2 →
→
with the ˆφ direction.

vz as z

The distributions of the v1 and v2 components of velocity are
expected to be roughly Gaussian with vanishing means and to be
to good approximation aligned with the Galactic polar coordinates
(minor vertex deviations as found in the solar neighbourhood by
Dehnen 1998, will not be discussed here). Consequently, they can
be characterised by their standard deviations σ1 and σ2. The distri-
bution of the vφ components peaks at a value of vφ that is slightly
smaller than the circular speed vc. However, it is not at all well
modelled by a Gaussian, because it is very skew, with many more
v than at vc + v, causing the population to have
stars at vφ = vc −
non-zero asymmetric drift. Notwithstanding this skewness that was
already known to Gustav Str¨omberg (Str¨omberg 1927), vφ distribu-
tions have traditionally been characterised by a mean and a stan-

dard deviation. Since a single Gaussian ﬁts the data very poorly,
the observed distribution is frequently modelled by a superposition
of two Gaussians: then the overall distribution is characterised by
two means, two dispersions and the ratio of the numbers of stars
accounted for by each Gaussian, a total of ﬁve shape parameters.

The purpose of this note is to introduce a new representation of
vφ distributions that is more eﬀective in the sense that it ﬁts typical
data more accurately with fewer and physically more meaningful
parameters. Moreover, the new representation has a dynamical ba-
sis, so it is able to connect the skewness of the vφ distributions to
the standard deviations in v1 and v2. With the new representation,
a single free shape parameter suﬃces to describe the distribution
in vφ for the whole population of stars in the solar cylinder, and
two parameters are suﬃcient to ﬁt the distribution in vφ of stars that
have a given distance from the plane. The formula predicts in a nat-
ural way both the magnitude of the asymmetric drift and the oﬀset
of the modal azimuthal velocity from the circular velocity, neither
of which is achieved by multiple Gaussians.

The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we derive an
approximation to the vφ distribution in an annulus in the Galactic
disc that can be used as standard for extragalactic measurements.
As most samples of the Galaxy are centred on certain Galactic alti-
tudes
, in Section 3 we use the adiabatic approximation (Binney
2010) to take into account the vertical motions of stars. In 3.1 we
derive a formula that accounts for the variation in the vφ distribu-
and test it against the velocity distributions of more
tion with
elaborate models. In Section 3.2 we derive a formula for the way
in which the in-plane motion of a star depends on the extent of its
excursions perpendicular to the plane. The outcome is a small cor-
rection to the vφ distribution derived in Section 3.1. In Section 3.3
we give formulae from which the distributions of vR and vz follow
once the distribution in vφ has been ﬁtted. In Section 4.1 we show
that our formulae provide good ﬁts to the disc model of Binney &
McMillan (2011; hereafter BM11), which has a rigorous dynam-
ical basis. In Section 4.2 we demonstrate the practical application
of the formula by ﬁtting data from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey.
Section 5 sums up and looks to the future.

2 VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION AS A 2D PROBLEM

There are three reasons for the asymmetry of the distribution of vφ
components of nearby stars: stars at low vφ are approaching apoc-
entre, so they have guiding-centre radii Rg smaller than the solar
radius, R0. As one moves inwards through the disc, not only does
the density of stars increase rapidly on account of the exponential
increase in the surface density Σ(R)
R/Rd), but the random
velocities of stars also increase, so a greater fraction of all stars
are on eccentric orbits that carry them far from their guiding-centre
radius Rg. Moreover, the eﬀective potential in which a star oscil-
lates around Rg rises much more steeply at R < Rg than it does at
R > Rg, so stars spend more time beyond Rg than they do interior
to it. In fact, as a population of stars heats up over its lifetime, the
asymmetry of the eﬀective potential causes the population to ex-
pand spatially, and by conservation of angular momentum its mean
rotation rate diminishes. For all these reasons, there are many more
∆ than at R0 + ∆.

A functional form for n(vφ) that is successful in ﬁtting observed
distributions will reﬂect these facts.

Following Shu (1969) we decompose the energy of a disc star

into three parts. If the star were on a circular orbit with angular
momentum Lz, it would have energy

Ec(Lz) = Φeﬀ(Rg, Lz),

where with the Galactic potential in the plane Φ(R)

(2)

and the guiding-centre radius Rg(Lz) solves the equation Rgvc(Rg) =
Lz, with vc(R) the circular speed. In addition to this energy, the star
has two smaller energies, namely the energy Ez of vertical motion
and the energy ER of random motion within the plane. We postpone
discussion of Ez and focus for now on stars with Ez = 0, which
move in the plane. We have

where F(Rg) is a function that determines the surface density of

dial velocity dispersion varies with R. On account of the tendency
noted above for a population to expand radially as it heats up, if
F(Rg) is the same for both cool and hot populations, the hotter
populations will have slightly larger radial scale-lengths than the
cool ones. Note that σ gives the intrinsic dispersion of stars at their
1/2 actually measured
guiding centre radius Rg. The dispersion
at some radius R will have contributions from all populations that
reach this radius and turns out to be
10 per cent higher than the
value of σ for the stars that have Rg = R on account of the presence
of stars that have guiding centres at Rg < R.

solar cylinder (the region restricted in radius to R
R0 but unre-
stricted in z). From our formulae we have that the shape of this ve-
locity distribution is controlled by four parameters: the galactocen-
tric radius of the measurement R0, the scale-length Rd of the young
disc, the local velocity dispersion σ0, and the scale-length Rσ on
which the velocity dispersion varies. The ﬁrst two parameters are
generally well-known and for ﬁts of the solar neighbourhood can
be set to R0 = 8 kpc and Rd = 2.5 kpc. The value of Rσ is less clear
and will be discussed below.
The dependence of n(vφ|

R0) on σ0 and Rσ is shown in Fig. 2.
In the upper panel we hold the dispersion scale-length constant at
7.5 kpc and show the velocity distributions for local dispersion val-
1. As σ0 increases, the distribu-
ues of σ0 = 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 km s−
tion becomes wider and the low-velocity tail rises much faster than
does the high-velocity tail, corresponding to an increasing asym-
metric drift. Simultaneously, the peak slowly shifts to lower ve-
locities. The lower panel shows the velocity distributions for ﬁxed

σ0 = 30 km s−
sion, Rσ = 10, 7.5, 5, 4 kpc. Smaller values of Rσ imply higher dis-
persion in the inner regions of the Galaxy and lower dispersion in
the outskirts. Thus for small Rσ stars from the inner disc can more
easily reach the R0 compared to their counterparts with larger Rg
so the azimuthal velocity distribution is more skewed and develops
a strong low-velocity tail. In the most extreme case, Rσ = 4 kpc,
1/2 approaches vc in the inner re-

tion shifts to higher vφ even as the tail at high vφ becomes weaker.
This eﬀect reﬂects the fact that stars with large random velocities
spread their contributions to the velocity distribution over many
radii, while stars with small random velocities localise their contri-
butions. Consequently, when Rσ is small, the width in R over which
stars contribute to vφ narrows strongly as Rg increases, which puts
R0 strongly in control of the mode of the local vφ
stars with Rg ≃
distribution.

3 THE VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION AS A FUNCTION OF

DISTANCE FROM THE PLANE

In the previous section we set Ez = 0 to obtain results that are ap-
proximately valid for the distribution of stars in vφ regardless of
their distance from the plane. In practice we can determine the ve-
locity distributions of the stars that lie in various more-or-less nar-
row ranges in z. We must now consider how these distributions will
vary with z and diﬀer from the aggregate distribution determined
above. In the following we do so using a number of quite crude
physical approximations. These approximations give useful physi-
as it does,
cal insight into why the distribution in vφ varies with

z
|

|

but ultimately the value of our ﬁnal ﬁtting formula does not depend
on the correctness of the arguments used to motivate it.

3.1 Weights of diﬀerent populations as functions of z

The key idea is that within the solar cylinder there coexist many
populations, one for each value of Rg. Indeed the chemical compo-
sitions and ages of stars vary systematically with Rg (see e.g. Luck
& Lambert 2011; Bensby et al. 2011; Sch¨onrich, Binney & Dehnen
2010, for observations and a short discussion of consequences for
studies of kinematics). Moreover, the smaller a population’s value
of Rg, the larger will be its mean value of Ez and therefore the larger
will be its vertical scale-height h at radius R; here h(Rg, R) is the
distance that at radius R provides the best ﬁt to the vertical density
proﬁle of the population through

nRg (R, z)

/h.

(19)

Note that with this formula we are not asserting that the real vertical
density proﬁle is exponential, but simply identifying the character-
istic vertical extent of the population. We now investigate how the
vertical extent of the population increases with R because the verti-
cal restoring force, which scales like Σ(R), decreases outwards.

BM11 show that a very good approximation to the vertical
dynamics of a population of stars can be obtained by assuming that
the vertical action

Jz ≡
of the population’s stars is adiabatically invariant as the stars oscil-
late in radius. We use this adiabatic approximation (aa) to estimate
the ratio h(Rg, R)/h(Rg, Rg).

(20)

−

Jz can be evaluated analytically only for a vertical force Kz that
is proportional to zα
1 and to the local surface density of the disc Σ,
so we assume these dependencies in order to gain an analytic model
– in reality Kz has a much more complex dependence on z, which
does not yield an analytic expression for Ez(Jz). Then the vertical

Let the ratio of the contributions to the distribution in vφ at
height z of the population with guiding-centre radius Rg and the
local population be given by the factor f (z, Rg −
R). Then from
equation (15) the distribution of vφ at altitude z above the plane is

f (z, Rg −
R0) gives the enhancement of stars with guiding-centre ra-
dius Rg relative to local stars, all lines intersect at ( f = 1, Rg = R0)
irrespective of the chosen altitude.

3.2 Impact of the AA on the radial motion

The aa predicts that any star’s value of Ez varies as it moves radi-
ally. Since the star is moving in a time-independent potential, its
total energy is constant. It follows that changes in Ez must be com-
pensated by changes in its energy of motion parallel to the plane.
Since Lz is a true invariant, the energy Φeﬀ(Rg, Lz) associated with
the underlying circular orbit is unchanged, so changes in Ez must
be compensated by changes in the radial energy ER. Hence (3) be-
comes

which might be called the “adiabatic potential” since it is the ef-
fective potential for radial motion that follows from adiabatic in-
variance of the vertical motion. At R > Rg ∆Φad increases with
R less rapidly than the standard eﬀective potential ∆Φeﬀ, so stars
can reach larger radii than they could if Ez were constant. BM11
simulated this eﬀect by simply increasing Lz to Lz + Jz.

With the power-law forms of the vertical potential that we in-
troduced above, we can obtain the dependence of Ez on Σ. From

shows, for ﬁve values of z, how f varies with Rg at R = R0. At z = 0,
f is an increasing function of Rg because at large Rg stars typically
have small Ez and therefore are more numerous in the plane than in
the solar cylinder as a whole. At z = 1 kpc, by contrast, f falls with
increasing Rg because high above the plane a sample is richer in
stars with small Rg, and therefore large Ez, than is the solar cylin-
der as a whole. The formula attains a maximum, where the local
scale-height of a population equals the altitude. Since by deﬁnition

Our plan is to use ∆Ez to modify our expression (10) for n(vφ|
R, z),
which has no dependence on vz and therefore does not specify
a value of Jz or Ez. Therefore in equation (35) we now replace
Ez(Jz, R) by an estimate Ez of the typical vertical energy of the stars
that are encountered at (R, z) with angular momentum Lz = Rvφ.
Equation (47) in the Appendix is an expression for Ez in terms of
h(Rg, R) and the vertical component of the gravitational potential.
Our next step is essentially to replace ∆Φeﬀ by ∆Φad in equa-
tion (29) but before we do this we have to recall that the prefactor

g(c) arose from normalising the radial probability density P(R
as given by equation (6). For consistency in this formula we must
now replace ∆Φeﬀ by ∆Φad, with the consequence that the normal-

the distribution of vφ at a given point in the Galaxy must be written

Figure 4. Demonstration of the eﬀect on velocity distributions above the
Sun of adding ∆Ez to the eﬀective potential to allow for the tendency of
vertical energy to shift orbits outwards. The velocity distributions are de-
rived from ﬁts to the models discussed in Section 4.1. Full curves show the
full corrections with Ez (“corr”), dashed lines give the same models with
the simple adiabatic approximation (“sAA”) ignoring energy conservation.

without (dotted curves) ∆Ez. Including ∆Ez moves all velocity dis-

Far from the plane (z

2 kpc) equation (36) breaks down be-
cause the physical assumptions on which it depends fail. A problem
that must be encountered at some height is that the vertical fre-
quency becomes comparable to the horizontal frequency, so the as-
sumption of adiabatic invariance of Jz fails – the coupling between
the horizontal and vertical motions becomes strong and complex.
However, BM11 did not encounter problems with the aa below
z = 2 kpc. The failure we encounter here probably arises from
∼
equation (47) for Ez, so we below explore the eﬀect of limiting the
energy transfer by placing an uper limit on the value of Ez to less
than (50 km s−

3.3 Velocity moments

From the formulae we have in hand we can calculate a variety of
moments. Suppose the stellar population of the disc were a super-
position of populations that have dfs of the form

f (ER, Lz, Ez)

(37)

where the dependence on Ez is inspired by equation (19). Then
since this df is a Gaussian in vR, we would have
= σ2. To
each value of Rg and therefore vφ we could ascribe a ﬁxed value
v2
= σ2, where in general lower vφ are connected to higher

From the work of Section 3.2 we know that ER is not strictly a con-
stant of the motion on account of the transfer of energy between
the radial and vertical motions, so these formulae are only approx-
imate. We shall see that they are nevertheless useful.

Here Ω(Lz) is the circular frequency for angular momentum Lz,
κ(Lz) is the radial epicycle frequency and ν(Lz) is its vertical coun-

in equation (42) is there to eﬀectively eliminate stars on counter-
rotating orbits and the value of L0 is unimportant provided it is
small compared to the angular momentum of the Sun. In equations
(41) and (42) the functions σz(Lz) and σr(Lz) control the vertical
and radial velocity dispersions. The observed insensitivity to radius
of the scale-heights of extragalactic discs motivates the choices

the thin disc, and a similar df for the thick disc, the normalisations
being chosen so that at the Sun the surface density of thick-disc
stars is 23 per cent of the total stellar surface density. Table 1 lists
the parameters of each component of the df.

BM11 took the gravitational potential to be that of Model 2
in Dehnen & Binney (1998) modiﬁed to have thin- and thick-disc
scale-heights of 360 pc and 1 kpc (Table 2). In this model the disc
contributes 60 per cent of the gravitational force on the Sun, with
dark matter contributing most of the remaining force.

4.1.1 Distribution in vφ

The points in Fig. 5 show the vφ distributions of the BM11 model
at R0 and heights up to 2 kpc, while the curves show the ﬁts to
these points that we obtain from equation (36) when we approxi-
mate ∆Φad with ∆Φeﬀ. We take α from equation (28) and at each
location (R0, z) we ﬁt the given vφ distribution independently by ad-
justing the parameters σ0, Rσ and h0. Table 3 gives the parameter
values obtained from the ﬁts and also the radial velocity dispersions
that the ﬁts yield through equation (38) and the true radial veloc-
ity dispersion within the model. Notice that the parameter σ0 rises

In both Figs. 5 and 6 the quality of the ﬁts is excellent, so the
inclusion of ∆Ez improves the optimum ﬁt only marginally. How-
ever, inclusion of ∆Ez does change the optimum value of h0 signif-
icantly and in the sense of bringing it closer to the true scale-height
of the model disc, which increases from small values very close to
the plane, where the gas disc dominates the gravitational potential,
300 pc, where the thin disc accounts for the
through 300 pc at z
majority of stars, to
1 kpc at large heights, where the thick disc is
dominant. Note that far from the plane the dominant population’s
scale-height h0 is signiﬁcantly smaller than the locally measured
scale-height of the disc because the population is dominated by
stars with Rg < R, which by equation (25) have h(Rg, R) > h0. Even
so, when ∆Ez is omitted, the ﬁtted values of h0 are unexpectedly
small. Including ∆Ez increases h0 at all heights, while limiting the
1)2 yields intermediate
values of Ez employed to less than (50 km s−
values of h0, which are not far from constant as we would wish.
The reason adding ∆Ez to the eﬀective potential increases h0 is that
∆Ez increases the contribution to the velocity distribution at R0 of

Irrespective of whether ∆Ez is used, the scale-length Rσ ex-
hibits a continuous rise in the ﬁts, moving away from the value
Rd/0.45 of the corresponding parameter of the torus model. Rσ
comes closer to Rd/0.45 the lower α is chosen at higher altitudes.

4.1.2 Distributions in vR

As we remarked in Section 3.3, the df (37) is such that stars of given
Lz have a Gaussian distribution in vR. Consequently, the distribution
in vR of all stars found at a given distance from the plane should in
this picture be a weighted sum of Gaussian distributions with the
weights implicit in equation (38). Fig. 7 compares this prediction
(lines) at several altitudes z with the corresponding distributions
from the torus models (data points). The overall agreement between
the data points and the predictions of the formula is remarkable
when one bears in mind that the curves have not been obtained
by ﬁtting to the data points. At low altitudes (red and green) the
formula predicts a distribution that is slightly too sharply peaked
1 kpc from the plane the ﬁt
and deﬁcient in the wings. Around
is near perfect. The agreement between the curve for 2 kpc and the
1 is much better in the lower panel
data points at
than the upper panel, vindicating the use of the correction provided
by ∆Ez.

Figure 6. Fitting the velocity distributions of BM11 at diﬀerent altitudes
using eq. (36). The scale-length of the disc was ﬁxed at their value of Rd =
2.4 kpc and the parameter α was assumed to be the function of z speciﬁed
by eq. (28).

4.2 Application to the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey

We have ﬁtted the full formula (36) at an altitude of z = 40 pc to
the velocity distribution of the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS)
of F and G stars (Nordstr¨om et al. 2004; Holmberg, Nordstr¨om &
Andersen 2009). As sample we selected the full 13 520 objects that
1 and
have measured space velocities. We adopted vc = 220 km s−
assumed that the Sun’s velocity with respect to the Local Standard
1 (Sch¨onrich, Binney & Dehnen 2010), so
of Rest is 12.24 km s−
1 was added to the published heliocentric vφ veloci-
232.24 km s−
ties. Given that the sample lies near to the mid-plane, where α = 2
would apply, we adopted α = 1.5, and we also set the local scale-
height to h0 = 200 pc: when α and h0 are allowed to vary when
ﬁtting to the data, they prove to be strongly correlated in the sense
that low values of α enhance the contribution of populations with
smaller Rg and thus favour larger values of h0 for balance. How-
ever, the diﬀerences between the residuals of the various best ﬁts
are not statistically signiﬁcant.

Fig. 8 shows two typical ﬁts performed on the region 150 <
1 < 250, which demonstrate how nicely and naturally the
vφ/ km s−
formula reproduces the non-Gaussianity of the azimuthal veloc-
ity distribution. The ﬁts are for scale-lengths Rσ = 7.5 kpc (blue
dashed line) and Rσ = 5 kpc (red solid line). The shorter scale-
length provides the better ﬁt at low vφ and the worse ﬁt to the high-
velocity tail. The shorter length scale also yields the smaller value
1 ver-
of the velocity-dispersion parameter, σ0 = 22.90

1. In the plane the core of the veloc-
sus σ0 = 24.57
ity distribution is dominated by the youngest part of the thin disc,
while the wings of the distribution will be dominated by the thick
disc, and as we proceed from the core to the wings of the distri-
bution stars of ever increasing age will grow in importance. Hence
the true distribution in vφ reﬂects the entire star-formation history
of the Galaxy and we cannot expect to obtain a perfect ﬁt to it by
adjusting a single velocity-dispersion parameter, σ0. Moreover, the
statistics of the GCS catalogue to some extent reﬂect the complex
selection biases involved in the catalogue’s formation, and we have
made no attempt to replicate these biases. Neglect of these com-
plexities is presumably why our ﬁt is less good than that obtained
by Sch¨onrich, Binney & Dehnen (2010). The presence of kinemati-
cally hotter objects is conﬁrmed by the estimated value for σ0 drift-
ing to higher values when we expand the velocity interval on which
we perform the ﬁts. A couple of thin-disc scale-heights above the
plane the population will be more homogeneous, being dominated
by the thick disc, and it should be possible to obtain better ﬁts by
adjusting σ0.

Interestingly, on testing for a systematic shift in vφ the formula

recovered to 2 km s−

due to the higher uncertainties. We found that for local stars ∆Ez
does not play a signiﬁcant role, although it gives a bias of order

Fig. 9 compares the GCS data with the vR distributions that
follow from the ﬁts to vφ. It is clear that the formula under-estimates
the width of the vR distribution. In Section 4.1.2 we found that in
, the ﬁtted vR distribution
the case of the torus model at small
was somewhat narrower than the true one even though the vφ dis-
tribution was very closely ﬁtted. Correspondingly, in the case of
the GCS data, the failure of the ﬁt to the vφ to adequately populate
populate the wings of the distribution is mirrored in the ﬁt to the vR
distribution in Fig. 9 being least satisfactory in the wings.

5 CONCLUSIONS

The distribution of azimuthal velocities in the disc of a galaxy like
ours is very skew and varies systematically with distance from the
plane. Naturally one wants to be able to quantify such a distribution
in an eﬀective way. The traditional approach of ﬁtting it with a su-
perposition of Gaussians (e.g. Bensby et al. 2003; Ivezi´c et al. 2008;
McConnachie et al. 2006) is unsatisfactory, both because there is
no physical reasoning behind the use of a Gaussian when the distri-
bution is not dominated by measurement error, and because when

Figure 9. Derived vR velocity distributions at the parameters of Fig.8 versus
data.

a superposition of Gaussians is used, the parameters of the ﬁt are
neither unique nor physically informative.

Our formula is based on the approximation that the vertical
actions of stars are invariant as stars oscillate radially. We have re-
ﬁned this approximation by considering anew the impact that verti-
cal motion has on the radial oscillations, which BM11 found to be a
signiﬁcant eﬀect. Our treatment of this eﬀect, being based on over-
all energy conservation, is conceptually much sounder than that of
BM11 and promises to play a valuable role in the interpretation
of stellar velocities with rigorous dynamical models. However, we
ﬁnd that the power of our formula is only marginally improved by
our more rigorous treatment of how vertical motion aﬀects the ra-
dial oscillations.

Ultimately, our formula is just a ﬁtting formula rather than
a dynamical theory, even though we have derived it from dynam-
ical considerations. Something the derivation highlights is how
closely the horizontal and vertical motions of stars are intertwined,
notwithstanding the adiabatic invariance of actions. Because both
the vertical and horizontal random velocities of stars increase with
age, as one moves away from the plane the mix of stars one sees
fundamentally changes in the sense of increasing age and decreas-
ing radius of birth. The cleanest way to model this phenomenon
is by means of a df like those presented by Binney (2010), but a
couple of computationally challenging steps are required to extract
observationally testable velocity distribution such as n(vφ) from a
df: ﬁrst a connection has to be established between ordinary phase-
space coordinates and the isolating integrals upon which the df de-

pends, and then one has to marginalise over two velocities. Evalu-
ation of our formula is trivial by comparison.

Our derivation makes it plain that no population of stars can
simultaneously have scale-height and velocity dispersion that are
both independent of radius: the sub-population formed by stars that
have a narrow range of angular momenta must inevitably increase
in scale-height and decrease in vertical velocity dispersion with in-
creasing R, and if stars of larger angular momenta are added in
to hold constant the scale-height, they will have to have an even
smaller vertical velocity dispersion, so the vertical dispersion of
the entire population will decline steeply outwards. Given this sit-
uation, it is unwise to seek to deﬁne the thick disc in terms of a
given scale-height and velocity dispersion, as some recent papers
have done.

We validated our ﬁtting formula by using it to ﬁt the distri-
butions of vφ components at several distances from the plane in
a model with a well-deﬁned df that included both thin and thick
discs. Excellent ﬁts were obtained. The values of the ﬁtting param-
eters varied slightly with the level of sophistication of the model
employed, but were broadly in agreement with the values we would
expect given the underlying df, especially when the most sophisti-
cated approximations were used. This exercise implies that physi-
cal signiﬁcance can be attached to the values of parameters derived
from ﬁts to real data. Each ﬁt to a vφ distribution implies a model of
the corresponding vR distribution. In our tests these models turned
out to be very useful although showing a slight tendency to be too
narrow at small

.

We ﬁtted the formula to the vφ velocities of GCS stars and
obtained good but not perfect ﬁts for plausible values of the param-
eters. The blemishes in these ﬁts will arise from three causes: (i)
the well known presence of pronounced clumping of stars in the
(U, V) plane (Dehnen 1998), (ii) the need to model subtle selection
eﬀects in the GCS sample, and (iii) our formula is derived from an
isothermal df and must encounter diﬃculty ﬁtting data drawn from
a system that is a superposition of systems with very disparate dy-
namical temperatures. Hence in part the diﬃculties encountered in
ﬁtting the GCS data may reﬂect the importance at the extremes
of the vφ distribution of the thick disc and/or stellar halo. With a
larger body of data, or data taken further from the plane, it might
be proﬁtable to ﬁt the data to a sum of two or more instances of
our formula. Our ﬁt to the vφ components yields a model of the vR
components that is rather too narrow, in agreement with our work
with the model based on a df.

Our formula could be used to ﬁt the line-of-sight velocity dis-
tributions (LOSVDs) of galaxies in which individual stars are not
resolved (e.g. Bacon et al. 2001). Since our formula has been de-
rived on the assumption that the circular speed is independent of
radius, it might fail to produce a satisfactory ﬁt to the velocity distri-
bution of stars in a galaxy with a distinctly non-ﬂat rotation curve.
The physical basis of our formula breaks down at distances from
the plane of order 2 kpc, so failure to ﬁt data for stars at higher
altitudes might have no physical signiﬁcance.

We derived our formula by adapting to the three-dimensional
world the planar df of Shu (1969). It would be interesting to adapt
in a similar way the planar df of Dehnen (1999), which Dehnen has
argued is in certain respects superior to the Shu df. Unfortunately,
the adaptation of a planar df is a non-trivial exercise on account of
the intertwining of the radial and vertical motions mentioned above.
Therefore in this paper we have conﬁned ourselves to the Shu df,
which proves to provide a very useful point of departure.

Data for stars that lie at signiﬁcant distances from the plane
are now becoming available (Ivezi´c et al. 2008; Siebert et al. 2011).

A new formula for ﬁtting the azimuthal component of disc kinematics

11

The measured space velocities of such stars contain signiﬁcant er-
rors arising from a combination of errors in proper-motion and dis-
tance. It is essential to take proper account of these errors when
inferring the true kinematics of the underlying populations. Our
formula provides the natural way to do this: one ﬁts the data to the
result of folding the formula with appropriate distance and proper-
motion errors. Sch¨onrich, Asplund & Casagrande (2011) use this
methodology to extract in an elegant way the information contained
within the measured distribution of azimuthal velocities of stars
that have quite large random velocities. We will shortly present
similar analyses of samples that include a higher proportion of disc
stars.

APPENDIX: ESTIMATING THE TYPICAL VERTICAL
ENERGY

In this appendix we estimate the typical value Ez(Rg) of the vertical
energy Ez(Jz, R) of the stars that we encounter with speciﬁed an-
gular momentum Lz = Rvφ at a given location (R, z). Let σz be the
vertical velocity dispersion at (R, z). then

Regarding σz, we have that to an excellent approximation the ver-
tical Jeans equation reads (Binney and Tremaine 2008, eq. 4.271)
