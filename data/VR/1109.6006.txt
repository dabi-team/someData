ABSTRACT

The likely membership of the planetary nebula Abell 8 (PN G167.0–00.9) in the open cluster Bica 6 is
conﬁrmed by CCD spectra, UBV(RI)C photometry, and radial velocities for luminous cluster stars. The
reddening, estimated distance, and radial velocity of the planetary nebula agree with parameters derived for
Bica 6 of EB−V (mean) = 0.42, d = 1.60 ± 0.11 kpc, and VR = 57 ± 1 km s−1, with a cluster age of 109 yr,
a diagnostic blue hook, and a few blue stragglers, including a peculiar B1 Vnn star (HDE 277593) that may
be a post-AGB star. The results identify Bica 6 as a potential calibrator of the planetary nebula distance
scale. The central star of the planetary nebula has a reddening of EB−V = 0.49 ± 0.02, with a possible
circumnebular excess, and an estimated luminosity of MV = +7.44 ± 0.16. It is also an optical double in
2MASS images, with a likely progenitor according to evolutionary considerations being a late B-type dwarf
of ∼ 2.3 M⊙.

INTRODUCTION

The progenitors of planetary nebulae (PNe) are gen-
erally considered to have once been main-sequence
stars with masses of up to ∼ 8 M⊙ (e.g., Weidemann
2000), yet a practical demonstration of such a link has
so far been limited by the paucity of PNe associated
with intermediate-age open clusters, where physically-
associated, lower-mass, main-sequence progenitors may
exist. Searches for possible planetary nebula (PN)/open
cluster associations have revealed a number of potential
spatial coincidences, as noted by Ziznovsky (1975) and
Lubos Kohoutek (see Majaess, Turner & Lane 2007),
but available data on possible matches in radial veloc-
ity, reddening, and distance of the PNe and cluster stars
are as yet unconvincing (e.g., Kiss et al. 2008). The rel-
atively short duration of the PN evolutionary phase and
the rapid rate of dissolution of open clusters conspire to
make true physical links relatively rare, if they exist at
all (Majaess et al. 2007).

The distances to individual PNe are also diﬃcult to
establish, resulting in a variety of techniques applied to
the problem (Kaler 1985; Lutz 1989). If the central star
is bright enough for photometric or spectroscopic obser-

vation, the distance can often be established through
trigonometric or spectroscopic parallax. Trigonomet-
ric parallaxes, for example, have been derived for sev-
eral PNe through the U.S. Naval Observatory program
(Pier et al. 1993; Harris et al. 1997, 2007), from mea-
surements by the Hipparcos satellite (see Acker et al.
1998), and most recently by measurements with the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST, Benedict et al. 2009).
Spectroscopic parallaxes produce mixed results (e.g.,
Acker et al. 1998), which may relate to the models used
and the quality of spectra for faint stars. Nebular expan-
sion parallaxes have also been applied (Terzian 1997),
despite their observational limitations (Terzian 1997)
Indirect meth-
and initial assumptions (Kaler 1985).
ods also exist, the most basic being the Shklovsky dis-
tance method (Shklovsky 1956), which is tied to esti-
mates for the surface brightness of the surrounding PN
shell, thus being limited by the diﬃculties of recording
the spectra of PNe. Improved versions of the technique
(e.g., Zhang 1995; Phillips 2004) typically involve mea-
surement of the radio continuum surface brightness tem-
perature Tb. Finally, it is possible to infer distances to
PNe by using the reddening inferred from a comparison
of line strengths for emission features in their spectra
in conjunction with maps of reddening versus distance
for stars observed along the line of sight to the nebula

(Lutz 1973; Acker 1978; Gathier, Pottasch & Pel 1986;
Pollacco & Ramsay 1992). The recent IPHAS Hα sur-
vey of the Galactic plane has generated extensive visi-
ble/infrared photometry for many stars in the ﬁelds of
PNe, thereby permitting extension of the technique to
a greater selection of PNe (Sale et al. 2009), as done by
Giammanco et al. (2011).

As a result of many such studies, distance estimates
for PNe appear to fall into two categories: a “short”
scale advocated by groups such as Cahn & Kaler (1971),
Kaler, Shaw & Kwitter (1990), and Phillips (2004), and
a “long” scale tied to the results of Zhang (1995)
and Giammanco et al. (2011). The “short” scale is
supported by trigonometric parallaxes of PNe central
stars (e.g. Pottasch & Acker 1998; Harris et al. 2007;
Benedict et al. 2009), although the relative proximity
to the Sun for such objects makes them less-than-ideal
for such an assessment. A more deﬁnitive test could be
made by membership of a PN in a distant open cluster,
but, as noted above, the PN phase is relatively short-
lived, more than 99% of open clusters capable of housing
their progenitors have dissolved by the time they are old
enough to produce one, and most cases examined so far
are line-of-sight projections rather than physical associ-
ations (Majaess et al. 2007).

A new case of a planetary nebula/open cluster associ-
ation was recently discovered by Bonatto, Bica & Santos
(2008) involving the planetary nebula Abell 8 (PN
G167.0–00.9) with the cluster Bica 6. Abell 8 was dis-
covered on Palomar Observatory Sky Survey images
by Abell (1955, 1966), and the associated cluster by
Bica (see Bonatto et al. 2008); its present designation
is from the 2009 update of the open cluster catalogue
of Dias et al. (2002). Preliminary parameters for Bica 6
from 2MASS JHKs data imply a cluster age of 1.0 ± 0.1
Gyr (Bonatto et al. 2008), indicating a progenitor star
of less than ∼ 3 M⊙. It is a sparse cluster with an as-
yet uncertain implied reddening and distance, a feature
that might be resolved through a photometric and spec-
troscopic study at visible wavelengths. Presented here
are new observations of that type revealing interesting
characteristics of the cluster and its embedded planetary
nebula, and strengthening the case for their association.
It is also noted here that the central star of Abell 8
appears to be double at far infrared wavelengths, a char-
acteristic not seen in the visual region. That point re-
quires further study, since the detection is at the bright-
ness limits of the 2MASS survey.

the 1.85m Plaskett telescope of the Dominion Astrophys-
ical Observatory. The same telescope was also used in
direct imaging mode to obtain broad band, all-sky, CCD,
UBV photometry for the cluster in January 2009, as well
as CCD photometry on the Gunn system in February
2010, the latter to provide independent estimates for the
magnitudes and colors of the planetary nebula’s central
star. Cousins system CCD BV(RI)C photometry was
obtained in March 2010 for cluster stars brighter than
V = 18 using the 0.35m robotic telescope at Sonoita Re-
search Observatory. The latter observations are tied to
numerous standards (Landolt 1983, 1992) observed over
a large range of air masses, and have an external zero-
point uncertainty of about 0.02 magnitude. A program
of regular observation of the cluster in the Johnson V-
band was also made at the Abbey Ridge Observatory
(Majaess et al. 2008) in order to search for variability
among bright cluster members, but without positive de-
tections to date.

2.2. PHOTOMETRIC REDUCTIONS

The optical UBV observations of Bica 6 were obtained
on the nights of January 23/24 and January 25/26, 2009,
PST with the 1.85m Plaskett telescope and E2V-1 CCD
detector, both nights being considered to be of photo-
metric quality. The CCD chip (1024×2304 pixels binned
2 × 2) is too large to accommodate uniform illumination
at the telescope focus, so the frames were trimmed to a
useable size of 1020 × 1800 pixels before processing. The
chip’s image scale of 0.59 arcsec pixel−1 and frame size
after trimming resulted in a surveyed ﬁeld measuring
10′ × 17′.7.

DAOPHOT and ALLSTAR, followed by aperture cor-
rections and transformations to the standard system us-
ing routines provided by Stetson (private communica-
tion). Because of concerns about the photometric stabil-
ity of the two nights of observation, transformation equa-
tions initially were obtained by allowing the software
to compute the solution using individually-determined
zero-points for the images. Good frames were selected
on the basis of the zero-points and the FWHM mea-
surements of the stars, as well as visual inspection of
the frames themselves. Since the quality of the nights
proved to be somewhat uneven, a selection of local stan-
dards were used as well; the Sonoita photometry was
used for those stars. A log of the DAO observations
that were used in the analysis is given in Table 1. Note
that, as a result of the above frame selection process,
the program ﬁeld air masses were not always bracketed
by the standard ones.

The transformation equations used were of the form:

v = V + a0 + a1X + a2(B − V )
b = B + b0 + b1X + b2(B − V )
u = U + c0 + c1X + c2(U − B)

where b, v, and u are the instrumental magnitudes, B, V,
and U are the transformed magnitudes, X is the air mass,
and the colors are the standard values. The transfor-
mation coeﬃcients were obtained iteratively using least
squares, with observations weighted according to the
standard and observed photometric uncertainties and
the residuals (observed minus actual). Typical weights

ness.

ﬁeld in NGC 2419 identiﬁed by Stetson (CADC local
projects) were used for the transformations. Since Stet-
son’s observations consist of BVRI only, photoelectric
photometry from Racine & Harris (1975) was used to
obtain standard U magnitudes for NGC 2419.

The images were bias-subtracted and ﬂat-ﬁelded us-
ing standard routines within IRAF. Absolute photom-
etry was performed on all
frames according to the
usual procedure of point-spread function ﬁtting using

residuals of 0.042. Since the quality of the two nights
diﬀered, transformation coeﬃcients for each night were
obtained separately, and kept for the rest of the cali-
bration (a useful feature of the Stetson routines); the
photometry from both nights was combined in the last
step (weighted according to the quality of the data). The
coeﬃcients obtained are in Table 2. The average uncer-
tainty (s.e.) per observation ranged from ±0.006 for V
to ±0.029 for U.

Typical PSF-ﬁtting uncertainties as determined by
DAOPHOT and ALLSTAR ranged from δu, δv, δb ≃
±0.001, ±0.001, ±0.002 for instrumental magnitudes of
u, b, v = 12, to δu, δb, δv ≃ ±0.013, ±0.024, ±0.027
for instrumental magnitudes of 16, for combined U , B,
V images of exposure time 360 s, 180 s, and 90 s, re-
spectively. Uncertainties for the adopted aperture cor-
rections varied between ±0.0002 to ±0.0147 depending
on the aperture, with a median value of about ±0.002.
Uncertainties in the ﬁnal, transformed photometry are
presented in Fig. 1.

SPECTROSCOPIC REDUCTIONS AND SPECTRAL

CLASSIFICATIONS

The spectra were used to classify cluster stars on
the MK system using standard techniques involving line
strengths and line ratios in the blue-green spectral region
(see Gray & Corbally 2009), as well as to derive radial
velocities for the stars. A ﬁnder chart for the spectro-
scopically observed objects is presented in Fig. 2, the
continuum-ﬂattened spectra are plotted in Fig. 3, and
Table 3 summarizes information for the stars, as well
as for the central star of Abell 8. The stars are identi-
ﬁed by their J2000 co-ordinates in the 2MASS catalogue
(Cutri et al. 2003), converted to degrees, and the num-
bering of Fig. 2. The data include estimates of V, B–V,
and U–B, with uncertainties of less than ±0.01 magni-
tude for V and B–V (except for the central star), spectral
types assigned with reference to the MK spectral atlas as
well as Gray & Corbally (2009), reddening and distance
modulus information inferred from the spectral classiﬁ-
cations, and radial velocities derived from parabolic ﬁts
to the cores of reasonably strong, unblended lines in the
spectra (54 lines per star, on average).

The precision of stellar radial velocities depends upon
the spectral dispersion (e.g. Schneider et al. 1983), and
for our wavelength-calibrated 60 ˚A mm−1 spectra is typ-
ically ±10 km s−1 or better (p.e.). The accuracy of
the radial velocities obtained in this fashion is gener-
ally more secure. For example, a spectral scan of a 103
˚A mm−1 spectrogram for the Hyades spectroscopic bi-
nary HD 30869 by Turner, Lyons & Bolton (1986) mea-
sured in such fashion yielded a velocity within 2 km s−1
of the actual value from only 5 unblended lines. Tests us-
ing a variety of CCD spectra obtained with the Plaskett
telescope’s Cassegrain spectrograph measured in similar

fashion indicate no need for a zero-point adjustment.

Star 1 is HDE 277593, classiﬁed as B8e in the Henry
Draper Extension. Our spectrogram does not extend to
Hα, so we cannot conﬁrm the emission-line nature of
the star; higher Balmer series members are all in ab-
sorption. Moreover, the spectral lines display strong ro-
tational broadening, and also indicate a much earlier
spectral type: B1 Vnn. Such a hot star appears anoma-
lous, lying in the midst of a cluster of F-type and G-type
giants. Yet its radial velocity is comparable to the veloc-
ities of other cluster members, which are about 60 km
s−1 more positive than expected for standard Galactic
rotation. The mean cluster velocity for the eleven stars
of similar radial velocity is 57.1 ±1.2 km s−1, where the
cited uncertainty represents the standard error of the
mean. The two deviant objects are star 7, conceivably a
spectroscopic binary given its similar reddening and dis-
tance modulus to other cluster stars, and star 13, which
has a velocity consistent with Galactic rotation for a
foreground star.

Table 3 includes information on the reddening and
distance moduli of the stars, most of which are more lu-
minous than zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) objects,
where intrinsic colors were adopted from FitzGerald
(1970), Kron (1978), and, for main-sequence stars, stel-
lar atmosphere predictions for the colors of zero-age
zero-rotation stars (Collins & Smith 1985) with a zero-
point adjustment to match A0 stars (see Turner 1992),

and absolute visual magnitudes from the compilation of
Gray & Corbally (2009) in conjunction with an exten-
sion of the calibration of Turner (1980). A ratio of total-
to-selective extinction of R = AV /EB−V = 3.0 ± 0.1
and a reddening relation of slope EU−B/EB−V = 0.75
for early-type stars were found previously for ﬁelds lying
at the Galactic longitude of Bica 6 (Turner 1976b), and
were adopted here. The variation of apparent distance
modulus, V–MV , with color excess, EB−V , for stars in
Table 1 is consistent with such a result (see §3).

2.4. PHOTOMETRIC STANDARDIZATION

As noted above, the direct images of Bica 6 from the
DAO were calibrated using comparable images of stan-
dard stars observed at air masses similar to those for
Bica 6. For consistency, minor adjustments were made
to the BV magnitudes to improve the match to the all-
sky CCD BV(RI)C photometry from the Sonoita images.
A similar procedure was used for the initial calibration
of the U-band images, namely by reference to U magni-
tudes for standard stars. However, most current CCD-
telescope-ﬁlter combinations produce very poor matches
to the wavelength sensitivity of the Johnson U ﬁlter (see
Turner 2011), and in such cases the calibration of U mag-
nitudes and U–B colors can be non-linear and possibly
multi-valued (Moﬀat & Vogt 1977; Cousins & Caldwell
2001). In fact, the initial UBV color-color diagram con-
structed for cluster stars displayed characteristics indi-
cating systematic eﬀects in the U data.

Removal of such eﬀects from the ﬁnal data set was
done as follows. The BV(RI)C colors for Bica 6 stars
plotted in Fig. 4 indicate that the only unreddened ob-
jects in the ﬁeld are late-type stars and one or two
likely early A-type stars. The majority of stars in
the sample are reddened by about EB−V ≃ 0.5. For
spectroscopically-observed stars, one can relate the spec-
tral type of the star to tabulated intrinsic colors (e.g.,
FitzGerald 1970) to calculate the correction, δ(U–B),
to the initially observed U–B color, required to make
the computed color excesses EU−B and EB−V ﬁt the
accepted reddening relation for the ﬁeld (see above), ad-
justed in the case of the cooler stars for the color de-

pendence of color excesses and reddening slope (e.g.,
Fernie 1963). For a few stars it was possible to iden-
tify them from Fig. 4 as unreddened main-sequence stars
from their faintness and BV(RI)C colors, thereby indi-
cating the correction to U–B needed to make their colors
ﬁt the intrinsic color-color relation for dwarfs. Finally,
the ﬁeld reddening for spectroscopically-observed stars
varies relatively smoothly across the ﬁeld, so some of the
fainter stars lying within roughly 30′′ of them and indi-
cated to be reddened from their BV(RI)C colors were
assumed to share the same reddening, as an approxima-
tion, thereby allowing additional corrections to U–B to
be calculated, as above.

The dependence of the derived corrections for the
stars is plotted as a function of observed B–V color
in Fig. 5, producing a reasonably well-deﬁned depen-
dence matched to a best-ﬁtting polynomial. Nor-

Fig. 5.— The correction for U–B colors as a function of
B–V for stars observed spectroscopically (ﬁlled circles) and
stars that are either unreddened or reddened as their nearby
spectroscopic neighbors (open circles). The plotted gray re-
lation was adopted to adjust the CCD colors to the Johnson
system.

mally such corrections are spectral type dependent (see
Moﬀat & Vogt 1977), but most stars in the Bica 6 ﬁeld
are reddened by similar amounts, which are not large,
so a simple color dependence appears to be appropriate.
The adopted color dependence δ(U–B) shown in Fig. 5
was therefore applied to all observed stars, except very
red objects with B − V ≥ 1.45, for which a constant
correction of +0.15 produced more reasonable results.

The eﬀectiveness of such a procedure can be judged
from Fig. 6, which plots the UBV color-color diagram
for the 391 stars in the ﬁnal adjusted data set that
have full UBV coverage. The colors for cluster stars
are a good match to the intrinsic relation reddened by
EB−V = 0.42, which represents the mean color excess
for the ﬁeld. According to the results of Fig. 5, the un-
certainties in the adjusted U–B colors may be as large
as ±0.10, although for most stars they are probably not

much larger than ±0.05. Within such limits, the color-
color data of Fig. 6 are well matched to the reddened
intrinsic relation over the entire range of likely spectral
types for the stars, from B-type stars to M-type stars.

3. PARAMETERS OF BICA 6

Fig. 7 is a color-magnitude diagram for the complete
data set of observed Bica 6 stars, with no elimination
of foreground or background stars. Included is the zero-
age main sequence (ZAMS) relation from Turner (1976a,

0.42 and V–MV = 12.28; the black curve is a theoretical
isochrone for log t = 9.0 from Meynet et al. (1993) for the
same parameters.

1979) reddened by EB−V = 0.42 for V–MV = 12.28,
along with a theoretical isochrone for log t = 9.0 from
Meynet, Mermilliod & Maeder (1993) matched to the
same parameters. The parameters are in very close
agreement with the results obtained by Bonatto et al.
(2008) from 2MASS JHKs data. A variety of more
recently published isochrones could have been plotted
for comparison, with nearly identical results. Those of
Meynet et al. (1993) were employed because they ap-
pear to provide slightly better ﬁts to the observational
data for stars in open clusters than is the case with some
others (see Turner 2011).

An independent solution for Bica 6 was attempted
with the 2MASS observations (Cutri et al. 2003) using
the intrinsic JHKs relations of Turner (2011). JHKs
data for stars lying within 6′ of the center of Bica 6
cited by Bonatto et al. (2008) are plotted in Fig. 8 along
with the intrinsic relations of Turner (2011). The data
were separated according to the cited uncertainties in
the magnitudes into a high quality group, σ ≤ ±0.06,
and a low quality group with larger uncertainties.
It
was diﬃcult to establish the reddening uniquely, either
because of large scatter in the data or because of diﬀeren-
tial reddening in the ﬁeld, although there is a reasonably
good match of the data to EJ−H = 0.124, corresponding
to the average reddening of EB−V = 0.42 obtained for
the UBV data. For that reddening the apparent distance
modulus is J–MJ = 11.32 from ZAMS ﬁtting, coinci-
dent with the distance modulus of V–MV = 12.28 used
with the BV data in Fig. 7. There is also a close match
of a log t = 9.0 isochrone to the JHKs data, as noted
by Bonatto et al. (2008), although the model isochrone
used in Fig. 8 is an independent relation adapted from

of the center of Bica 6, from observations
by Cutri et al. (2003). In the upper plot, the intrinsic color-
color relation for main sequence stars is plotted as a gray
curve, while a solid black curve is the same relation reddened
by EJ −H = 0.124 (EB−V = 0.42).
In the lower plot, the
ZAMS is plotted as a black curve for the same reddening
and J–MJ = 11.32 (V–MV = 12.28), while the gray curve
is an isochrone for log t = 9.0. Filled circles represent data
with uncertainties smaller than ±0.06, plus signs represent
data with larger uncertainties, and gray circled points are
estimates for the two stars near the center of Abell 8.

Meynet et al. (1993) (see Turner 2011).

The existence of diﬀerential reddening across the
ﬁeld of Bica 6 is evident from the reddenings for
spectroscopically-observed stars (Table 3), as well as
from sizeable scatter in the UBV and 2MASS colors for
cluster stars (Figs. 6 & 8) and visual inspection of images
of the ﬁeld. There is a noticeable increase in the visual
extinction on the southwest side of the ﬁeld, accord-
ing to an apparent decrease in star densities there, and
that is conﬁrmed by the derived color excesses of stars
in the region. As a consequence, the ﬁnal parameters
for Bica 6 were established from a variable-extinction
analysis of the UBV observations for cluster stars (see
Turner 1976a,b). Stars with full UBV coverage were
therefore individually dereddened to the intrinsic rela-
tion for main-sequence stars in Fig. 6, color excesses
were adjusted to equivalent values for a B0 star using

7

for good quality data (see Turner 1976a,b), it appears
that the uncertainties in the derived U–B colors amount
to ±0.10 only in extreme cases. The true scatter for
most cluster stars appears to be much smaller, as noted
earlier.

The data of Fig. 9 fall

into ﬁve distinct groups:
(i) unreddened foreground stars with apparent distance
moduli of V0–MV ≤ 8.7, indicating that the dust clouds
creating much of the extinction in the Bica 6 ﬁeld lie at
distances of d ≃ 550 pc, (ii) reddened foreground stars
more distant than 550 pc with color excesses ranging
from 0.2 to 0.9 and apparent distance moduli of 7–12,
(iii) three apparently reddened background objects (or
stars with anomalous data) with true distance moduli
of V0–MV ≥ 12.5, (iv) a group of 64 stars with V0–
MV ≃ 11 and color excesses ranging from 0.08 to 0.94,
most of which are likely ZAMS members of Bica 6, and
(v) a group of 22 stars with V0–MV ≃ 12 and color ex-
cesses ranging from 0.29 to 0.63 that appear to be ZAMS
members of a group lying background to Bica 6. All of
the stars in the last group (v) lie on the northeast side
of the ﬁeld, and may be associated with a sparse, per-
haps dissolved, cluster of faint stars that appears to lie
in that region. The data for stars in group (v) were
analyzed using least squares and non-parametric tech-
niques, yielding a value of R = AV /EB−V = 3.05 ± 0.31
s.e. and V0–MV = 12.01 ± 0.15 s.e., corresponding to a
distance of 2.56 ± 0.18 (s.d.) kpc.

The data for stars in the more populous group
(iv) were also analyzed using least squares and non-
parametric techniques, which yielded a value of R =
AV /EB−V = 2.99 ± 0.13 s.e. and V0–MV = 11.02 ± 0.06
s.e., corresponding to a distance of 1.60 ± 0.11 (s.d.)
kpc. The values of R derived for both groups agree with
prior expectations (R = 3.0, §2.3) for the characteristic
properties of dust clouds lying in the direction of Bica
6 (Turner 1976b), and the implied distance of ∼ 550
pc to the dust complex along the line of sight matches
independent results by Neckel & Klare (1980) for the
distribution of dust along adjacent Galactic sight lines.
The latter results also indicate that there is no addi-
tional reddening in this direction for a further 2 kpc or
so, presumably implying that the interarm region be-
tween the local Cygnus arm and the Perseus structure
is relatively free of dust and extinction. That would
explain why there is no obvious separation of groups
(iv) and (v) in Fig. 9 in terms of color excess, EB−V .
The stars in both groups have been reddened by the
dust associated with a complex lying well foreground to
them.

It is worth pointing out that results such as those
presented here appear typical of what is found in other
Galactic star ﬁelds associated with open clusters (Turner
1994). Galactic dust complexes appear to be spatially
restricted around the Sun (Neckel & Klare 1980), pro-
ducing interstellar reddening and extinction of diﬀering
amounts for all stars lying beyond a dust complex or be-

the relationship of Fernie (1963), and apparent distance
moduli were calculated using ZAMS values of MV from
Turner (1976a, 1979). The results are shown in Fig. 9
along with the apparent distance moduli for spectro-
scopically observed stars in Table 3.

An alternate method to dereddening the data is pos-
sible using BVRIC or other infrared colors, but such an
approach in this instance would result in greater uncer-
tainties in the derived color excesses. Most of the stars
in the ﬁeld are of apparently late spectral type, for which
BVRIC reddening lines run nearly parallel to the intrin-
sic color relations for dwarfs (see Turner et al. 2011, and
Fig. 4). Attempts to infer intrinsic colors for stars in the
observational sample would therefore produce color ex-
cesses EB−V of larger uncertainty than those generated
from analysis of the UBV observations.

An initial concern with such an approach was the
possibility that large scatter in the U–B colors might
produce biased results. The eﬀects of random photo-
metric errors on variable-extinction analyses of O-type,
B-type, and A-type stars were investigated previously by
Turner (1976a), and it is a simple matter to extend the
results to the GK dwarfs dominating the ﬁeld of Bica
6. As a consequence, we expect the determination of
R = AV /EB−V for cluster stars to be biased towards
a value of R = 1.9, with a total spread in color ex-
cesses EB−V approximating ∼ 0.2. The data of Fig. 9
are at complete variance with such expectations. There
is no apparent bias towards a value of R ≃ 2, and the
spread of color excesses is more than twice as large as
expected. There are also many unreddened stars in the
ﬁeld. Given the generally consistent trends of the data in
both Fig. 6 and Fig. 9 to what is typical of the scatter
in cluster color-color and variable-extinction diagrams

tween individual complexes. The notion of interstellar
reddening increasing monotonically with distance from
the Sun is incorrect. In most directions the reddening is
produced in one or more dust clouds lying along the line
of sight, with the reddening for individual stars reﬂect-
ing both the number of dust clouds lying between the
star and the Sun and the amount of extinction occurring
in each cloud along the line of sight to the star. In the
case of the Bica 6 ﬁeld, there appears to be only one
dust complex detected to the limits of the survey, and it
is located ∼ 550 pc distant.

Spectroscopically observed stars conﬁrm the results
of the variable-extinction analysis. The derived mean
intrinsic distance modulus for stars in Table 3 is V0–
MV = 11.02 ± 0.08 s.e., identical to what was found
from ZAMS ﬁtting, regardless of questions about the
membership status of individual stars. The correspond-
ing distance of 1.60 ± 0.06 kpc agrees with the value of
1.7 ± 0.1 kpc obtained by Bonatto et al. (2008) for Bica
6 using an independent main sequence calibration. The
close agreement of UBV, JHKs, and spectroscopic dis-
tance estimates for Bica 6 provides a solid foundation for
the distance of the cluster. The reddening is also con-
ﬁrmed to be diﬀerential across the face of the cluster,
but lies mainly in the range from 0.2 to 0.6 in EB−V ,
averaging 0.42 in EB−V .

4. CLUSTER MEMBER ABELL 8

Some of the observed parameters of Abell 8 (PN
G167.0–00.9) are relatively poorly established (Kaler
1983; Cahn, Kaler & Stanghellini 1992), but suﬃcient
to permit estimates of reddening from the Hβ/radio ﬂux
method (Milne & Aller 1975; Cahn 1976; Bianchi & Grewing
1985) or the Balmer line method (Osterbrock & Ferland
2006). The color excess is EB−V = 0.55 ± 0.45 when
one combines the 1.4 GHz ﬂux density measured by
Condon & Kaplan (1998) with the Hβ ﬂux estimated by
Kaler, Shaw & Kwitter (1990) and Cahn et al. (1992),
the generous uncertainty resulting from propagation of
the large relative uncertainties in the input quantities.
Estimates for the reddening from the Balmer decrement
(Cahn & Kaler 1971; Ali 1999; Philips, Cuesta & Kemp
2005; Giammanco et al. 2011) in conjunction with the
conversion factor of Majaess et al. (2007) imply values
of EB−V = 0.51, 0.44, 0.42, and 0.47, respectively, with
expected uncertainties for the latter of order ±0.08 (e.g.,
Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). The reddening estimates
are summarized in Table 4 along with independent esti-
mates for radial velocity and distance.

An independent estimate is possible from the space
reddening information obtained from the variable-
extinction analysis presented here. The reddening of
stars in Bica 6 and near Abell 8 (Fig. 10) suggests
the existence of internal reddening within the nebula
itself. Stars near the planetary nebula have color ex-
cesses of EB−V = 0.37 ± 0.01 (2 in front), 0.59 (behind),

Fig. 10.— Derived space reddenings (numerals in black)
for Bica 6 stars for the ﬁeld of Fig. 2 (upper) and in the
vicinity of Abell 8 (lower), with reddenings cited in units
of 0.01 magnitude without the decimal. The reddenings for
Bica 6 stars represent group means for clumps of 6–8 stars
in the same direction, those for Abell 8 are individual color
excesses.

and 0.53 (oﬀ west limb), implying an internal redden-
ing of EB−V ≃ 0.22. Such a result appears reasonable
given possible excess reddenings for PNe associated with
dust produced during evolution on the asymptotic gi-
ant branch for their progenitor stars (see Majaess et al.
2007). The implied reddening of the central star is
therefore EB−V = 0.48 ± 0.05, where the uncertainty
reﬂects the full spread in internal reddening inferred for
the planetary. A similar value of EB−V = 0.53 ± 0.05
is obtained by adopting an intrinsic B–V color of –
0.38 from Kaler & Feibelman (1985) with the observed
color from Table 5. The various estimates of redden-
ing are remarkably consistent, yielding a mean value of
EB−V = 0.49 ± 0.02, adopted here.

The measured radial velocity of Abell 8 is 58.2 ± 6.5
km s−1 (Schneider et al. 1983; Durand, Acker & Zijlstra
1998), according to measurements from low quality spec-
tra by Purgathofer & Perinotto (1981). That agrees
with the radial velocity for Bica 6 members of 57.1 ± 1.2

km s−1 (Table 3). The good agreement in the estimates
of reddening and radial velocity for the planetary neb-
ula with values obtained for stars in Bica 6 provides
reasonably good evidence for their physical association,
although the case from reddening alone is clearly weak,
given that it results from dust clouds lying well fore-
ground to Bica 6.

Estimates for the distance to Abell 8 (PN G167.0–
00.9) are typically linked to inferences about its red-
dening, but vary from “short” values of 1.67 kpc
(Kaler et al. 1990) and 1.78 kpc (Cahn & Kaler 1971;
Phillips 2004) to “long” values of 3.23 kpc (Zhang 1995)
and 5.5 kpc (Giammanco et al. 2011) according to the
methodology used, as indicated in Table 4. The for-
mer are very close to the distance of 1.60 ± 0.11 kpc
obtained here for Bica 6, thereby favoring the “short”
scale of planetary nebula distances.

The IPHAS result (Giammanco et al. 2011) is sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent, and appears to imply a reddening-
distance relation from IPHAS photometry for stars in
this ﬁeld that deviates markedly from results found here
and by Neckel & Klare (1980). As noted earlier, inter-
stellar reddening is diﬃcult to correlate exactly with dis-
tance in the Galactic plane, given that it appears to arise
mainly in distinct dust clouds along Galactic sight lines
(see Turner 1994), and that may help to explain the dis-
crepancy in this case. Note that the discrepancy is in
distance only; the color excesses found for Abell 8 agree
quite closely (Table 4).

The evidence for a physical association between Abell
8 and Bica 6 is particularly strong for the radial veloc-

ity observations, since the expected heliocentric velocity
from Galactic rotation for an object 1.6 kpc distant at
ℓ = 167◦ is ∼ 60 km s−1 more negative. It would be
highly unusual to have two spatially adjacent objects
sharing such unusual Galactic orbits if they were not
physically associated. Certainly, according to the crite-
ria of Majaess et al. (2007), Abell 8 is a likely member
of Bica 6.

5. EVOLUTIONARY CONSIDERATIONS

A selection of 114 stars in the Bica 6 ﬁeld were iden-
tiﬁed as potential or likely cluster members according
to the star counts of Bonatto et al. (2008), the radial
velocity data (Table 3), their reddening, and inferred lo-
cation in the color-magnitude diagram (Figs. 7 and 8).
The colors and magnitudes were corrected individually
for the eﬀects of interstellar reddening and extinction,
and the resulting extinction-corrected color-magnitude
diagram is shown in Fig. 11. As is the case with the
JHKs data (Fig. 8 and Bonatto et al. 2008), the best
isochrone ﬁt is for log t = 9.0.

In the evolutionary models of Meynet et al. (1993),
stars reaching the terminal stages of evolution on the
main sequence for log t = 9.0 have masses of ∼ 2.1 M⊙,
as is also the case for stars on the red giant branch of
Bica 6 according to the VandenBerg, Bergbusch & Dowler
(2006) isochrones (not shown). The progenitor of Abell
8 (PN G167.0–00.9) must therefore have been a more
massive B-type dwarf originally, perhaps up to ∼ 2.3 M⊙
(∼B9.5 V spectral type). The implied current mass of
∼ 0.6 M⊙ for the central star of Abell 8 and ∼ 0.55 M⊙

comparison purposes, a distance of 5.5 kpc for Abell 8
(Giammanco et al. 2011) would imply an absolute mag-
nitude of MV = +4.76 for the central star and a linear
diameter for the PN of 1.60 pc, parameters that are in-
compatible with each other. The former value is typical
of a luminous central star that has only recently en-
tered the PN stage (Benedict et al. 2009), while the lat-
ter value is large even for a highly evolved PN (Zhang
1995).

Our data for cluster stars suggest that the central
star of Abell 8 should have a far infrared brightness
of roughly J ≃ 20, well beyond the magnitude cutoﬀ
of the on-line photometry for the 2MASS survey near
J = 17, yet an image appears in the survey at J ≃ 17.2
at the proper location. By comparison, the star’s op-
tical brightness is near the limit of our imaging (see
Figs. 2 and 10). It is conceivable that the infrared bright-
ness of the object reﬂects emission from circumstellar
dust, but additional observations are needed to assess
such a possibility as well as to conﬁrm the results. The
JHKs data otherwise appear consistent with expecta-
tions for a blue central star, since the estimated J–H
and H–Ks colors are –0.1 and –0.1, respectively.

Although the star is single at optical wavelengths, it
appears to be double in 2MASS images. The companion
lies ∼ 2′′ east of the central star, and is of identical
brightness in the J band, being brighter at H and Ks.
Its estimated J–H and H–Ks colors are +0.7 and +0.2,
respectively. The companion is undetected in optical
images. Both stars ﬁt nicely into the cluster color-color
and color-magnitude diagrams for 2MASS photometry
(Fig. 8), the companion as an M dwarf, implying that
the two stars may form a wide physical binary system as
well as a close optical double. The symmetrical shape of
Abell 8 has been taken as evidence for a single progenitor
central star by Soker (1997), which does not necessarily
contradict such arguments.

fall short of the progenitor star’s original mass, implying
extensive mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch
phase of the star to fully account for the mass budget.
The excess reddening for Abell 8 found here from space
reddenings for spatially adjacent stars is consistent with
such a picture.

Our various photometric estimates for the brightness
of the blue central star of Abell 8 (Table 5) include
eye estimates (e.g., Perek & Kohoutek 1967) from the
Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS), as well as our
own estimates made from image diameters measured on
the POSS-II images and calibrated using similar mea-
surements for adjacent stars of known magnitude (the
present photometry). In conjunction with the ﬁeld red-
dening of Table 4 and the derived distance to Bica 6, the
data imply an absolute magnitude of MV = +7.44±0.16
for the central star and a linear diameter for the PN
of 0.47 ± 0.03 pc, consistent with the advanced evo-
lutionary state of the planetary nebula and the star’s
location towards the cool end of the PNe central star
cooling sequence (Kaler 1983; Kaler et al. 1990). For

sequence star would be ∼ 9 − 10 M⊙, several times the
turnoﬀ point mass of the cluster. An intriguing possi-
bility is that the star, if it is indeed a cluster member, is
a post-asymptotic giant branch object caught in the act
of evolving into a planetary nebula. One other exam-
ple of a post-AGB object, LS II+34◦ 26 = V1853 Cyg
(Parthasarathy 1993), appears spectroscopically like a
less-evolved object in blue-green spectra (Turner 1983;
Turner & Drilling 1984; Turner 2003), except for Balmer
line emission. Star 1 may be a less extreme example of
the phenomenon, given that it is not an IRAS source
(see Parthasarathy 1993; Turner 2003). The diﬀerence
between its original temperature classiﬁcation as B8 and
its present classiﬁcation as B1 may, like LS II+34◦ 26, be
indicative of rapid evolutionary changes (Turner 2003).

SUMMARY

Abell 8 (PN G167.0–00.9) is a very good case of a
planetary nebula belonging to an open cluster, accord-
ing to the spectroscopic and photometric results pre-
sented here. The inferred properties of the PN as a
cluster member therefore provide useful empirical tests
of the luminosities of PNe central stars as well as the
PN distance scale. In the case of the latter, the implied
distance of Abell 8 is consistent with the “short” PNe
distance scale, and at variance with results implied by
advocates of the “long” distance scale. More intriguing,
however, is the cluster Bica 6 itself, since it appears to
contain stars in a variety of evolutionary states associ-
ated with the evolution of main-sequence stars to their
eventual fate as white dwarfs.
In addition to the PN
and its central star, additional likely cluster members
include standard F-type and G-type giants evolved from
the main sequence, two likely blue stragglers, and one
star, star 1 (HDE 277593), that may be a post-AGB star
evolving towards the PN state. Future additional spec-
troscopic and photometric observations of cluster stars
would appear to be justiﬁed.
