Abstract. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations are performed in order to investigate mass transfer in a close binary
system, in which one component undergoes mass loss through a wind. The mass ratio is assumed to be unity. The radius of the
mass-losing star is taken to be about a quarter of the separation between the two stars. Calculations are performed for gases
with a ratio of speciﬁc heats γ = 1.01 and 5/3. Mass loss is assumed to be thermally driven so that the other parameter is the
sound speed of the gas on the mass-losing star.
Here, we focus our attention on two features: ﬂow patterns and mass accretion ratio, which we deﬁne as the ratio of the mass
˙Mloss. We characterize the
accretion rate onto the companion,
ﬂow by the mean normal velocity of wind on the critical Roche surface of the mass-losing star, VR. When VR < 0.4AΩ,
where A and Ω are the separation between the two stars and the angular orbital frequency of the binary, respectively, we obtain
Roche-lobe over-ﬂow (RLOF), while for VR > 0.7AΩ we observe wind accretion. We ﬁnd very complex ﬂow patterns in
between these two extreme cases. We derive an empirical formula of the mass accretion ratio as 0.18 × 10−0.75VR /AΩ in the
low velocity regime and 0.05 (VR/AΩ)

1. Introduction

Wind accretion plays an essential role especially in the evolu-
tion of detached binary systems such as symbiotic stars, pre-
cursor of peculiar red giants, ζ Auriga stars and massive X-ray
binaries. In the majority of symbiotic stars, the system con-
tains a hot component - believed to be a mass-gaining white
dwarf - and a cool component, the mass-losing red giant (e.g.,
Mikołajewska 1997 for a review). Recent studies indicate that
many of the red giant components in symbiotic stars do not ﬁll
their Roche lobe, i.e., RRG <∼ ℓ1/2, where RRG is the radius
of the red giant component and ℓ1 is the distance of the inner
Lagrangian point from the centre of the red giant (e.g., M¨urset
& Schmid 1999). This possibly discloses that symbiotic stars
are - with probably only the exception of T CrB (e.g., Anupama
& Mikołajewska 1999) - well detached binary systems. Thus,
mass transfer in symbiotic stars seems to be driven by wind,
and wind mass loss is therefore a key ingredient for triggering
symbiotic activity on a white dwarf companion. On the other
hand, the mass accretion rates expected in the Bondi-Hoyle pic-
ture (Bondi & Hoyle 1944) for such detached binary systems

are usually much lower than those required to maintain the
symbiotic activity of the systems. For example, Nussbaumer
(1991) pointed out that in most symbiotic stars the typical rates
of wind mass loss red giant are in the range 1 × 10−6M⊙ yr−1
to 1 × 10−8M⊙ yr−1 and that the expected accretion efﬁciency
of wind capture is probably no better than one percent. Hence,
the accretion rates associated with most symbiotic white dwarfs
are probably in the range of 1×10−8M⊙ yr−1 to 1×10−10M⊙
yr−1, which are too low to power the typical luminosities of
symbiotics (>∼ 1000L⊙) unless they are all in a late phase of hy-
drogen shell-ﬂash (novae) on a white dwarf (e.g., Sion & Ready
1992; Sion & Starrﬁeld 1994). It will nevertheless be shown in
the present paper that the mass accretion rate is smaller than
that expected by a simple Bondi-Hoyle picture.

It has recently been suggested that some of the mass-
accreting white dwarfs in symbiotic stars are the progenitors of
Type Ia supernovae (e.g., Hachisu & Kato 2001). On the other
hand, it has long been discussed that the efﬁciency, the ratio of
the mass captured by the white dwarf to the mass lost by the
red giant, is very small (say, a few per cent) and not enough to

increase the white dwarf mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit
(e.g., Kenyon et al. 1993).

Wind velocities in cool red giants are typically a few times
10 km s−1 and comparable to the orbital velocity in most sym-
biotic binary systems. Therefore, ﬂow patterns are probably
something between Roche lobe overﬂow (RLOF) and Bondi-
Hoyle wind accretion kinds of ﬂows. The efﬁciency of capture
in symbiotics should therefore not be estimated by the Bondi-
Hoyle picture but by direct simulations of intermediate, com-
plicated ﬂow patterns.

Symbiotic stars are not the only systems in which wind ac-
cretion play a signiﬁcant role. The most adopted model for the
formation of peculiar red giants, Barium, CH and S stars, re-
quire a binary system containing an Asymptotic Giant Branch
star (AGB) transferring mass via its stellar wind to a main se-
quence companion which becomes polluted in Carbon and s-
process elements (see e.g. Bofﬁn & Jorissen 1988). The AGB
then evolve into a white dwarf while the companion will appear
as Carbon or s-process rich and, when on the giant branch, as
a peculiar red giant. Bofﬁn & Zacs (1994) have shown that an
accretion efﬁciency of only a few percent is enough to explain
present Barium stars. Objects related to these are the extrinsic
S stars which also show symbiotic activity (e.g. Carquillat et
al. 1998) and bipolar planetary nebulae (e.g. Mastrodemos &
Morris 1998).

ζ Aurigae systems are another kind of system where wind
accretion plays a role. In these eclipsing double-lined binaries,
a main sequence star has an accretion wake produced by the
wind of its K supergiant companion. The eponymous system, ζ
Aur, is a binary with a 972 days orbital period and containing a
5.8 M⊙ K4 Ib and a 4.8 M⊙ K B5 V star (Bennett et al. 1996).
Finally, accretion wakes are also reported for high mass X-
ray binaries (HMXB). These systems consist of a compact ob-
ject, neutron star or black hole, orbiting a massive OB primary
star which has a strong stellar wind. The X-ray emission is be-
lieved to be due to accretion of matter on the compact compan-
ion.

There have been already many numerical studies of stel-
lar wind in a close binary system. Biermann (1971) com-
puted two-dimensional stellar wind using a characteristic
method. Sorensen, Matsuda & Sakurai (1975) performed two-
dimensional ﬁnite difference calculation of stellar wind emit-
ted from a Roche lobe ﬁlling secondary. They used the Fluid
in Cell (FLIC) method with ﬁrst order of accuracy and a
Cartesian grid. They computed Roche lobe overﬂow (RLOF)
as well. Sawada, Hachisu & Matsuda (1984) calculated two-
dimensional stellar wind from a contact binary using a Beam-
Warming time implicit ﬁnite difference scheme and a gener-
alized curvilinear coordinate. Their main goal was to com-
pute the angular momentum loss rate from the system, which
is an important factor to deﬁne the evolution of the binary
system. Sawada, Matsuda & Hachisu (1986) computed two-
dimensional stellar wind from a semi-detached binary sys-
tem using the Osher upwind scheme and a generalized curvi-
linear coordinate. They observed a transition from RLOF to
stellar wind by increasing the wind speed on the mass-losing
star. The present study is a three-dimensional version of their
study. Matsuda, Inoue & Sawada, (1987) also conducted a

similar study and discovered a ﬂip-ﬂop instability of the bow
shock formed around a compact mass accreting object (see also
Bofﬁn & Anzer, 1994, and on the stability issue, Foglizzo &
Ruffert, 1997 and 1999, and Pogolerov, Ohsugi & Matsuda,
2000). However, it was found that the phenomenon was charac-
teristic to two-dimensional case (Matsuda et al., 1992, Ruffert,
1996). In the present work we perform three-dimensional cal-
culation in which we do not observe the ﬂip-ﬂop instability.

These simulations concerned the case of a compact object
moving in a wind and were mostly aimed at estimating the va-
lidity of the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate. Binary effects were
partially simulated by including velocity or density gradient in
the wind. There are a few simulations however which simulate
in full mass transfer by wind in a binary system (Blondin et al.
1991, Theuns & Jorissen 1993, Blondin & Woo 1995, Theuns
et al. 1996, Walder 1997, Mastrodemos & Morris 1998, Dumm
et al. 2000, Boroson et al. 2001, Gawryszczak, Mikołajewska,
& R´o˙zyczka 2002). Theuns & Jorissen (1993) and Theuns,
Bofﬁn & Jorissen (1996, TBJ96 in the following) performed
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a 3 M⊙ AGB
transferring mass through its stellar wind to a 1.5 M⊙ main se-
quence companion, in order to test the wind accretion model
for the origin of peculiar red giants. They performed simula-
tions using a polytropic equation of state with γ =1., 1.1 and
1.5 and found mass accretion ratios (that is, mass accretion
rate/mass loss rate) of 1-2% for the γ = 1.5 case and 8 % for
the other models, i.e. about ten times smaller than the theoreti-
cal Bondi-Hoyle estimate. They also observed that this value is
dependent on resolution.

Walder (1997) presented simulations of wind accretion in
well separated binaries for three different cases: a HMXB, ζ
Aur and a barium star progenitor. He obtains mass accretion
ratio (mass accretion rate/mass loss rate) of 0.6, 3 and 6 %, re-
spectively. Walder & Folini (2000) also presented a nice review
of wind dynamics in symbiotics binaries, with an emphasis on
the inﬂuence of the radiation ﬁeld of the accretor.

More recently, Dumm et al. (2000) presented three-
dimensional Eulerian isothermal simulations in order to repre-
sent the symbiotic system RW Hya which seems to present an
accretion wake, as indicated by the reduced UV ﬂux observed
at phase Φ = 0.78. They found that 6% of the M-giant wind is
captured by the companion.

In this paper we perform three-dimensional numerical sim-
ulations of mass transfer by wind in a binary system with a
mass ratio of unity. The full gravitational forces of the two com-
ponents are taken into account. This is therefore different from
the e.g. TBJ96 or Dumm et al. (2000) studies, where in order
to account for the not very well known acceleration mechanism
of the wind, the gravitational force of the primary is partially
or totally reduced.

Here, we will concentrate on the derivation of the mass ac-
cretion ratio. We will leave for a following paper the physical
discussion of the ﬂow, including a discussion of angular mo-
mentum loss from the system.

2. Assumptions and numerical method

2.1. Model

Consider a detached binary system of equal mass: one larger
star blows stellar wind which the other, more compact, compo-
nent partly accretes. We normalize the length by the separation
of the two stars, A, and the time by 1/Ω, where Ω is the angular
velocity of the binary system. The surface of the mass-losing
star is assumed to be an equi-potential surface, whose mean ra-
dius is 0.25. The radius of the mass accreting star is assumed
to be 0.015 or smaller.

From an OB star, stellar wind is mainly accelerated by line
absorption of UV radiation. In symbiotic stars or in precursors
of peculiar red giants (PPRGs), the stellar wind mechanism
from the cool star is poorly known, and may imply radiation
onto dust grains. One needs however to still bring the matter
far enough away from the star so that dust grains can form. In
more evolved red giants, this may be done through the effect
of pulsation. It is however still not clear what the mechanism
could be in non-pulsating red giants, as they seem to exist in
some symbiotic or extrinsic S stars.

It is therefore clear that simplifying assumption have to be
made. In the present study, we will thus simply assume that the
wind is generated by thermal pressure, like in the solar wind.
More complicated wind structures will be studied in a forth-
coming paper.

We assume that the gas is an ideal one and is character-
ized by the ratio of speciﬁc heats, γ. In the present work we
consider two extreme cases : γ = 5/3 and γ = 1.01. In the lat-
ter case, the gas is almost isothermal except where there are
shocks. This isothermality may be explained as an outcome
of good thermal conduction. We neglect other complex effects
like magnetic ﬁelds, radiation and viscosity (except numerical
one).

We have carried out our simulations for the case of a mass
ratio unity. Although this may not be representative for PPRGs,
symbiotic stars or HMXBs, this should not change very much
our results.

2.2. Method of calculation

We solve the three-dimensional Euler equations using a ﬁnite
volume scheme. As Riemann solver, we use the SFS scheme
and we apply the MUSCL method to interpolate physical vari-
ables in a cell; the details on the scheme is described in Makita,
Miyawaki & Matsuda (2000), and RLOF simulations using the
same method are given in Fujiwara et al. (2001).

Calculations are done in the rotating frame of a binary and
include the gravity of the two stars, the centrifugal and Coriolis
forces. We use a Cartesian coordinate with the origin at the
mass accreting star. The computational region is −1.5 < x <
0.5, −0.5 < y < 0.5, 0 < z < 0.5 and we assume symmetry
around the orbital plane (Fig. 1).

The region is divided into 201 × 101 × 51 cells. The mass
accreting companion star is represented by a cubic hole with
cells of 3 × 3 × 3, including the lower half of the hole under

the orbital plane. Its physical dimension is 0.03 × 0.03 × 0.03
in our units.

In order to study in details the structure of the ﬂow near the
mass accreting object, we introduce a three levels nested grid.
At the second level, the region −0.25 < x < 0.25, −0.25 <
y < 0.25 and 0 < z < 0.25 is further divided into 102 × 101 ×
51 cells. At the third level, the region −0.125 < x < 0.125,
−0.125 < y < 0.125 and 0 < z < 0.125 is once more divided
into 104 × 104 × 54 cells. The cell size of the third level is thus
1/4 of the original ﬁrst level cell. The hole of 3 × 3 × 3, in the
ﬁrst level, is represented by a hole with 12 × 12 × 12 cells in
the third level.

A typical symbiotic star, ζ Auriga or PPRG has an orbital
period of a few years and a separation of a few AU. In this
case, the cell size of 0.03 is of the order or even larger than
a main sequence star. This is thus applicable for ζ Aurigae or
PPRGs. For S or symbiotic stars, we should simulate the case
of an accreting white dwarf. This would require a hole about
100 times smaller. This is well beyond present days numerical
capabilities. This is also true if one would like to simulate the
compact accreting object in HMXBs.

One should note however that the size of our accreting ob-
ject is still smaller than the one adopted by e.g. TBJ96. They
have shown that the mass accretion rate decreases with de-
creasing accreting size and our value is similar to their high-
est resolution model. We thus also consider a case of a hole
having a size of 3 × 3 × 3 cells (i.e. of physical dimensions
≃ 0.01 × 0.01 × 0.01 at the third level in order to investigate
the effect of the size of the mass accreting object on the results.

Fig. 1. Computational region.

2.3. Boundary conditions and initial condition

The outer parts of the mass-losing star is ﬁlled by a gas of den-
sity ρ = 1 and sound speed cs. If the pressure inside the mass-
losing star is larger than that outside the mass-losing star, gas is
ejected from the surface. The velocity of the ejected gas is com-
puted by solving a Riemann problem between the two states.

At t = 0 the computational region except the mass-losing
star is ﬁlled by a tenuous gas with density ρ0 = 10−5, velocity
u0 = v0 = w0 = 0 and pressure p0 = 10−4/γ. The com-
putational region is gradually ﬁlled with the gas ejected from

4

Nagae T. et al.: Wind accretion in binary stars

the mass-losing star. The outside of the computational region is
ﬁlled by the initial gas all the time. Mass outﬂow/inﬂow from
the outer boundary can occur; the amount of outﬂow/inﬂow
is also calculated by solving Riemann problems between two
states. This (outside) boundary condition, which we call the
ambient condition, insures the stability of the computation. The
inside of the mass accreting hole is almost vacuum and the gas
approaching the hole is absorbed.

We start the calculation at t = 0 and terminate it when
the system becomes steady. In the wind cases half an orbital
period is enough to reach a steady state, but in the RLOF cases
we have to calculate at least a few orbital periods.

3. Numerical results

3.1. Parameters

As was described earlier, we adopt γ and the dimensionless
sound speed of gas in the mass-losing star, cs, as the model
parameters. In the present work, we consider the cases of γ =
1.01 and γ = 5/3. When cs is less than some critical value, we
expect RLOF type ﬂows, while in the other cases, we expect
stellar wind kind of ﬂows. As is shown in Table 1, we study the
cases of cs = 0.5 − 2.5 for γ = 1.01, and cs = 0.75 − 2.5 for
γ = 5/3.

In PPRGs and symbiotic stars, the sound speed at the sur-
face of the mass-losing giant is of the order of 5-20 kms−1
while the orbital velocity is of the order of 10-40 kms−1. In ζ
Aurigae, both these values are around 40-100 kms−1, while in
HMXBs, the wind speed is of the order of a few thousands of
kms−1 while the orbital velocity is several hundreds of kms−1.
The parameter cs has no physical signiﬁcance, because the
mean radius, 0.25, of the mass losing star is chosen arbitrar-
ily for numerical purposes. Using the results of our numerical
simulations, we therefore calculate the mean value of the ver-
tical component of the gas speed on the critical Roche surface,
VR. We classify the ﬂow pattern using VR, which is shown in
Table 1 as well. It has to be emphasized that VR is not con-
stant along the critical Roche surface, especially in the Roche
lobe type of ﬂows. For these, it may be better to use cs as a
parameter. For the wind accretion type of ﬂow, which are more
isotropic, VR is more appropriate.

3.2. Roche lobe overﬂow

In a typical Roche lobe overﬂow (RLOF), gas on the surface of
the companion ﬂows through the L1 point and forms a narrow
L1 stream. The L1 stream deﬂects its motion to the negative y
direction in the present conﬁguration due to the Colioris force,
and then circulates counterclockwise about the mass-accreting
star to form an accretion disc. We show an example of such
typical ROLF ﬂow in the case of γ = 1.01 in Fig. 2 and 3.
Here we assumed the star to ﬁll its Roche lobe, so this is not
the main aim of this paper. They will serve as comparison for
the B-D and a cases discussed below.

If the temperature of the surface of the companion star, cs,
is raised, the L1 stream becomes thicker (Fujiwara et al., 2001).

We deﬁne the ﬂow to be of the RLOF type if the ﬂow circulates
around the accreting object in counterclockwise direction.

If we raise cs further, the gas escapes from the mass los-
ing star in all directions, and part of the gas rotates in a clock-
wise direction around the companion. These two ﬂows, rotat-
ing counterclockwise and clockwise, collide behind (i.e. to the
right) the accreting object to form a bow shock. This is a typical
wind accretion ﬂow.

In the B-D cases for γ = 5/3 and the a case for γ = 1.01,
we see from Table 1 that VR < 0.4, i.e. VR is smaller than the
escape velocity. The ﬂow is of the RLOF type. Similar types of
ﬂows have been obtained by other authors, e.g. Bisikalo et al.
(1998).

Figure 4 shows the density contours for model B (γ = 5/3,
VR = 0.01), and Figure 5 depicts the streamlines for the same
case. In this case, since γ = 5/3, the temperature of the disc
is so hot that the mass accretion ratio f , which is deﬁned in
Sect. 3.6, is not 1 but 0.34. Spiral shocks, typical of RLOF
ﬂows (Makita et al. 2000, Matsuda et al. 2000, Fujiwara et al.
2001) are not seen in this case.

One should note that contrarily to the impression one might
have when just looking at the ﬁgures, we have checked that
there is no inﬂow from the outer boundaries in these simula-
tions.

Figure 6 shows the comparison of model a (γ = 1.01,
VR = 0.06) and D (γ = 5/3, VR = 0.12). We observe spi-
ral shocks, although with a very much distorted shape.

spiral shocks which are typical to RLOF.

3.3. Intermediate ﬂow

In the cases E, b and b′, we observe that 0.4 < VR < 0.7. In
these cases, the ﬂow is not a typical RLOF or a wind accretion
ﬂow, but rather a very complicated intermediate one. Figure 7
shows the density contours of model E, and Fig. 8 depicts the
streamlines of the same model.

plane of the same model B as in Fig. 2. The Mach number
contours are represented by the shade, and the numbers in the
ﬁgure show typical Mach numbers. Streamlines are generated
from points separated by the same distance. We observe that the
ﬂow rotates counterclockwise around the companion, which is
a typical feature of RLOF type ﬂows.

(γ = 5/3, VR = 0.68). We observe very complicated shock
patterns.

3.4. Wind accretion ﬂow

For the cases with VR > 0.7, which are all the other models
than stated above, the gas ejected from the mass-losing star is
accelerated by thermal pressure. Almost all gas escapes from
the system and only a small part of gas is accreted by the com-
panion. We ﬁnd a typical conical bow shock attached to the ac-
creting object. Figures 11 and 12 show the density distribution,
the streamlines and the magnitude of the velocity for model g
(γ = 1.01, VR = 2.86).

plane of the same model E as in Fig. 7.

the model b (γ = 1.01, VR = 0.46).

Fig. 11. Density contours in the orbital plane of a typical wind
accretion ﬂow model g (γ = 1.01, VR = 2.86). We observe a
conical bow shock attached to the accreting object, which is a
typical feature of the wind accretion ﬂow.

Figure 9 shows the density contours and the streamlines of
the case b. We ﬁnd that the ﬂow pattern and the shock structure
are very complicated in these intermediate ﬂow.

We will now speculate on the possible cause of the com-
plicated structure of the intermediate ﬂow. Gas ﬂows from the
mass-losing star (left sphere) towards the mass accreting object
(right small sphere). The lower part of the ﬂow experiences a
shock, and is decelerated to subsonic speed. A small accretion
disc is formed around the companion, but some part of the gas
is accelerated to supersonic velocity again. It collides with the
gas coming from the positive y side and forms a bow shock.
The orientation of the bow shock is rotated almost 90 degrees
counterclockwise.

3.5. Calculations based on the nested grid

In order to test the effect of resolution near the mass accreting
object, we calculate the ﬂow using the nested grid described
above. Figure 13 shows the density contours for model g′. If
we compare the result of model g′ with that of model g, we
can see a slight oscillation on the bow shock for model g′.
Nevertheless, the essential features are unchanged except for
the mass accretion efﬁciency.

the accreting star are shown. Compare the present ﬁgure with
Fig. 11. We observe that the bow shock is slightly jaggy com-
pared with Fig.10. This is due to the reduced numerical viscos-
ity.

3.6. Mass accretion ratio

We calculate the mass accretion ratio f , which is deﬁned as the
˙Macc, to
ratio of the mass accreting rate onto the companion,
˙Mloss. The mass
the mass loss rate from the mass losing star,
accretion ratio as a function of VR is shown in Fig. 14. The
dash-dotted line is an empirical formula f = 0.18×10−0.75 VR,
which is valid in the range VR < 2.5.

In typical wind case we found that f is less than 1%, and
decreases further with increasing VR although it seems to sat-
urate (but see below). In the intermediate ﬂow regime, f is
about a few % to 10%. For RLOF f is greater than 10 % for
γ = 1.01. If we use the above empirical formula to the limit
of VR = 0, we have f = 0.18. Of course, this is not neces-
sary true and f = 1 is also possible. Although a direct com-
parison is not possible, our values are in good agreement with
the results obtained by TBJ96, Walder (1997), Mastrodemos &
Morris (1998) or Dumm et al. (2000).

The curve of the calculated accretion ratio based on the
coarse grid has a kink about VR = 2.6. This may be due to
the fact that the size of the accreting cubic box may be com-
parable to or larger than the accretion radius. In order to see
the effect, we reduced the size of the inner box. We found that
the position of the kink is shifted towards larger VR, and the
accretion ratio is reduced. This again is in agreement with the
analysis done by TBJ96.

For high wind velocity, we expect the Hoyle-Lyttleton the-
ory of wind accretion (Hoyle & Lyttleton 1939), that is the case
where pressure force is neglected, to be applicable. If it is the
case, then the mass accretion rate ˙Macc must be proportional
to the square of the mass accretion radius, 2GM/V 2
inf - with
Vinf being the wind velocity at inﬁnity, and so we expect that
f ∼ V −4
inf . Assuming a spherical symmetric wind around the
mass-losing component, we have
˙Mwind = 4πA2ρAVA,

(1)

near the mass-accreting component. For a high wind velocity,
we may expect that the accretion is determined by Hoyle &
Lyttleton’s formula, i.e.,
˙Macc = πr2

(2)

aρAVA,

where ρA is the mass density, VA is the wind velocity measured
on the rotating frame, both at the mass accreting component,
M1 is the mass of the mass-accreting component. Therefore,
the accretion ratio is calculated from

f =

Here, we use Kepler’s relation of A3Ω2 = G(M1 + M2) and
M2 is the mass of the mass-losing component. For the present
case of equal mass, the accretion ratio becomes

f = 0.25 ×

Note that we checked that the wind velocity does not
change by a noticeable amount between the Roche lobe sur-
face of the companion to the position of the primary. Hence,
we can put VA = VR in the above equation.

In Fig. 15 we show the accretion ratio as a function of
log VR. The upper line shows the simple Hoyle-Lyttleton for-
mula as given by Eq. (5). The lower line shows another exper-
imental formula 0.05 V −4
R , which agrees well with the calcu-
lated results for higher VR. It appears thus that the calculated
mass accretion efﬁciency is about 20 % of the predicted one.
Such a comparison is however not fair for at least three reasons.
First, because we take into account pressure, one should not
use Hoyle-Lyttleton relation but rather the Bondi-Hoyle for-
mula, and include the sound speed. Second, because our wind
is thermally driven and we are in a binary system, it is not obvi-
ous at all to determine which wind velocity should be inserted
in the equation. In the Hoyle-Lyttleton formalism, the velocity
which is inserted is the upstream wind velocity at inﬁnity. This
is clearly meaningless in a close binary where the wind may not
have reached its terminal velocity while close to the compan-
ion. Third, our wind is a diverging ﬂow from the mass losing
star, which contradicts the parallel upstream ﬂow assumed in
the Hoyle-Lyttleton or Bondi-Hoyle treatment. Therefore the
use of the Hoyle-Lyttleton or Bondi-Hoyle formalism can be
justiﬁed only qualitatively.

3.7. Time variation

We monitored the time variation of the mass accretion ratio. For
intermediate ﬂows the amplitude of time variation is about 30%
for γ = 1.01 and it is about 70% for γ = 5/3. This trend that
the amplitude of oscillation is larger for larger γ is applicable
to other cases. For larger VR cases the oscillation is negligible.
In Fig. 14, the error bars show the amplitude of the oscillation
of the mass accretion ratio. As was discussed above, the am-
plitude is larger for the ﬁner grid because of the reduction of
the numerical viscosity. By decreasing the size of the accreting
box, we increase the range in VR showing time variability. We
Fourier analyzed the time sequence of mass accretion and did
not ﬁnd any typical frequency.

4. Conclusion

1. The ﬂow pattern is classiﬁed by means of the normal speed
of gas on the critical Roche surface, VR. For VR < 0.4AΩ,
we have a RLOF type ﬂow, while for VR > 0.7AΩ, wind
accretion ﬂows are realized. In the intermediate parameter
range, 0.4AΩ < VR < 0.7AΩ, we observe very complex
ﬂows.

2. We construct an empirical formula for the mass accretion
ratio given by f = 0.18 × 10−0.75VR/AΩ, valid for low VR.
3. The calculated mass accretion ratio shows a kink at VR ∼
2.6AΩ. By using the nested grid, we found that this is be-
cause the assumed size of the mass-accreting box is com-
parable to or larger than the accretion radius. By reducing

the size of the mass-accreting box for the nested grid, the
position of the kink is shifted to larger VR.

4. For larger VR we obtain another empirical formula for the

mass accretion ratio f = 0.05(VR/AΩ)−4.

5. For typical wind accretion ﬂow, the results based on the
coarse grid and those of the nested grid are essentially the
same except the mass accretion ratio described above. For
intermediate ﬂow, the computed ﬂow pattern depends on
the resolution slightly. The amplitude of the oscillation of
the ﬂow increases with increased resolution because of re-
duced numerical viscosity.
