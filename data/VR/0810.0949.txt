ABSTRACT

We present new V– and R–passband CCD photometry of UU Sge and

V477 Lyr, the eclipsing binary nuclei of the planetary nebulae Abell 63 and

Abell 46, respectively. We have performed a simultaneous analysis of VR light–

curves and estimated the eﬀective temperatures for the primary and secondary

stars to be 78 000 ± 3000 and 6136 ± 240 K for UU Sge, 49 500 ± 4500 and

3874 ± 350 K for V477 Lyr. We have also reanalysed the previously mea-

sured radial velocities and combined the results with those obtained from the

analysis of the light curves to derive absolute parameters of the components.

The secondary stars have larger radii than expected from their main–sequence

counterparts at the same masses. We have determined the post–common en-

velope ages and the thermal time scales of the systems and examined the

possible reasons of expanded radius of the secondary components, together

with some selected post-common envelope binaries. We conclude that the

secondary components of the nuclei of the planetary nebulae are still out

of thermal equilibrium along with two post-common envelope systems: HS

1136+6646 and RE 1016-053. For other systems, magnetic activity has been

suggested as the more plausible reason for their expanded radii. We have also

estimated the common–envelope eﬃciency parameters of UU Sge and V477

Lyr.

INTRODUCTION

The classical approach to planetary nebulae (PNe) is that they are envelopes ejected by

single stars (0.86M/M ⊙610) at the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage. How-

ever, up to date, it has been reported that at least 10-15 per cent of planetary nebula

nuclei (PNNi) are very close binaries with periods in the range of hours to a few days

(Bond & Grauer 1987; Bond & Livio 1990; Bond 2000). Recently, some radial velocity sur-

veys have been carried out in order to search for new variable PNNi, which have periods too

long to be detected using photometry (e.g. De Marco et al. 2004; Af¸sar & Bond 2005). The

existence of these objects has been explained by means of common envelope (CE) ejection

by several authors (Paczy`nski 1976; Iben & Livio 1993; Iben & Tutukov 1993). According

to CE evolution theories, the atmosphere of the primary component will expand during the

red giant branch (RGB) or AGB evolution, and depending on the initial separation of the

binary system, both components will be engulfed by extended atmosphere of the primary.

The gravitational drag forces arise due to orbital motion of the secondary component around

the primary’s core (spiral-in process) will cause orbit to shrink dramatically. Because of the

conservation of total angular momentum, the orbital angular momentum will be transferred

to the CE and as a result the envelope is spun up and ejected from the system. Thus, the

outcome will be a close binary as a nucleus of a planetary nebula. The eﬃciency of which

orbital energy is deposited into CE ejection is deﬁned as “eﬃciency parameter”, denoted as

αCE. Our knowledge on the CE evolution is highly limited due to the diﬃculties in deter-

mining of stellar and nebular parameters. However, the central stars of the PNe, which are

also members of eclipsing binary systems, are the direct evidence of the existence of the CE

phase and provide an opportunity to drive accurate absolute parameters of these objects.

There are a number of these objects and only four of them are eclipsing binaries: UU Sge,

V477 Lyr, BE UMa and SuWt 2. The other close binary nuclei are known to be as binaries

either due to reﬂection eﬀect (see De Marco et al. 2008 for a detailed study) or ellipsoidal

variation they show in their light curves, or they are just single-lined spectroscopic binaries.

The eclipsing binary nuclei UU Sge, the nucleus of Abell 63, and V477 Lyr, the nucleus

of Abell 46, were previously studied by several authors. The eclipsing nature of UU Sge

was ﬁrst reported by Hoﬄeit in 1932. After three decades the presence of a low-surface

brightness nebula was discovered by Abell (1966), and Bond (1976) showed the connection

between PN and UU Sge. The ﬁrst photoelectric photometric observations of the system

were made by Bond et al. (1978). They obtained a light curve in B– passband and indicated

that the system has a total eclipse at the primary conjunction. They also noted the extreme

heating eﬀect in the system due to large temperature diﬀerence between the components.

From the solution of the light curve they concluded that the system contains an sdO primary

of ∼0.9 M⊙ with a temperature of about 35 000 K and a dK secondary of ∼0.7 M⊙. They

also emphasized that the observations of the system was contaminated by the nearby optical

companion ∼4′′ (later to be measured as ∼2′′.8 by Walton et al. 1993) to the east of UU

Sge and they could not determine the true depth of primary minimum accurately. However,

they estimated the contamination of the optical companion from the primary minimum

observations and suggested that the actual depth of the primary eclipse should be about 4.3

mag.

Later, Budding & Kopal (1980) obtained the V–passband light curve of the system. They

found the O-type primary component has a temperature of not much higher than 30 000 K

and the secondary component is around 6000 K. Van Buren et al. (1980) discovered the soft

X–ray emission feature of UU Sge and suggested that the observed X–ray originates in the

corona of the late-type star.

Walton et al. (1993) made spectroscopic observations of the system at several phases.

Using the spectrum taken during the primary minimum they estimated the spectral type of

the secondary component as G7 V. From the spectra obtained at out-of-eclipse they deduced

that the exciting hot central star is an sdO type PN nucleus with a temperature of around

50 000 K.

The ﬁrst V– and I–passband CCD photometry was made by Pollacco & Bell (1993, hereafter PB93).

However, in I–passband, they only obtained the primary minimum since they aimed to use

the primary eclipse to determine an accurate temperature for the secondary. Using the

medium–resolution spectroscopy, they obtained the ﬁrst radial velocities for the system.

They used the results deduced from the analysis of radial velocities for the solution of the

V–passband light curve. Since CCD observations enabled to subtract the contamination of

the neighboring ﬁeld star, they derived the more accurate absolute parameters for the in-

dividual components. After performing a series of light curve solution, they estimated an

eﬀective temperature of 117 500 K for the primary component and ﬁxing this value for

the ﬁnal light curve solution they suggested a temperature of ∼7300 K for the secondary

component.

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

4 M. Af¸sar and C. ˙Ibanoˇglu

In a later study, Bell et al. (1994, hereafter BPH94) conﬁrmed that the primary eclipse

is total with a duration of ∼14 min. They also obtained the spectroscopic observations of

the system during primary minima and extracted the spectrum of secondary component.

Applying Kurucz (1979) atmosphere models to the spectra they determined a secondary

component’s temperature of 6250±250 K. Adopting this value for the secondary component

temperature they revised the preliminary light curve analysis. Solutions indicated a primary

component with a temperature of 87 000±13 000 K for a limb-brightened (Bond & Grauer

1987) secondary component.

V477 Lyr, the eclipsing binary nucleus of the PN Abell 46, has a similar light curve

to UU Sge, except that the eclipse is partial (Bond 1980). The system shows a very large

reﬂection eﬀect which creates sine–like distortion on the light curve with an amplitude of

∼0.6 mag.

Although its eclipsing nature was reported more than two decades ago, a few light curve

solutions of V477 Lyr have been published. Ritter (1986) presented a solution based on a

light curve analysis by L.W. Twigg (communicated by Bond, 1981). This solution yielded

an orbital inclination of 80.◦8 with a mass ratio of M1/M2∼2.3, radii of R1∼0.09 R⊙ and

R2∼0.20 R⊙. The temperature of the primary component was taken as T1∼105 000 K.

Considering a typical mass value for the central star of a planetary nebula (Sch¨onberner

1981), Ritter assumed a mass for the primary component as M1∼0.6 M⊙, which yields a

secondary component mass of M2∼0.25 M⊙. Also, Bond & Grauer (1987) cited the results

of a preliminary analysis by J. Kaluzny and a temperature of 60 000 K for the primary

component was suggested.

The most recent and detailed solutions of both light and radial velocity curves were made

by Pollacco & Bell (1994, hereafter PB94). They obtained the medium-resolution spectra

and a new V–passband CCD photometry of the system and presented the ﬁrst complete

light curve of V477 Lyr. They performed a series of light curve solution for the eﬀective

temperature of primary component ranging from 30 000 to 130 000 K. Using the mass

ratio (M2/M1=0.29) obtained from the radial velocities and adopting the limb-brightening

for the secondary component, they achieved a best ﬁt to the observations for the eﬀective

temperature of 60 000 K. Thus, the V–passband light curve solution yielded an inclination

of ∼80.◦5, and a temperature of ∼5300 K for the secondary component.

In this paper, we present new two–colour CCD photometry of UU Sge and V477 Lyr.

The aim is to constrain the eﬀective temperatures of the components through simultaneous

solutions of the two–colour light curves. We will estimate the common envelope eﬃciencies,

αCE, and discuss reasons for the oversized secondaries that we ﬁnd.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

2.1 UU Sge

We have obtained the Johnson V– and R–passband photometry of the system at the National
Observatory of the Scientiﬁc and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T ¨UB˙ITAK–

TUG) in Antalya. TUG is established on the mountain of Bakırlıtepe (in the West Taurus

Mountain ranges), at a height of about 2500 m. Observations were carried out using a 1.5-m

Cassegrain telescope (RTT 150) equipped with 2048×2048 back illuminated CCD camera

which has an area of 9′.1×9′.1 and a scale of 0.26′′/pixel. We observed the system on the

nights between July 4 and 7 and on the nights of 2002 August 6, 7 and 11. Since the orbital

period of UU Sge is relatively short (∼11.5 hours) and the system has a very deep primary

minimum (∼4.5 mag), exposure times were limited between 60 and 120 s. The light curves

were phased by using the ephemeris given by Kiss et al. (2000),

HJD (Min.I) = 2451766.5285 + 0.46506921E d.

UU Sge has a nearby optical companion ∼2′′.8 to the east of the binary nucleus. The

visual magnitude of the companion is V=15.87 mag. (Ciardullo et al. 1999). The visual

magnitudes of the binary system itself at maxima and in mid–eclipse are Vmax=14.67 mag

and Vmin=19.24 mag (PB93), respectively.

The data were reduced using the appropriate tasks in IRAF

1. First a master bias was

created and subtracted from the images. Then we used an averaged master ﬂat-ﬁeld, which

we created using the ﬂat frames taken both during the evening and morning twilight, and

normalized all the images. Since UU Sge is located within a crowded region, images were also

trimmed right after bias and ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections. After ﬁrst reduction steps were completed,

IRAF/DAOPHOT package was used to apply the crowded ﬁeld photometry. Thereby, we were able

to make proﬁle ﬁtting and PSF (Point Spread Function) modeling of the stars in the target

ﬁeld and subtract the light contamination of the nearby optical companion. We measured

the PSF magnitudes of UU Sge and ﬁve nearby stars to apply diﬀerential photometry. These

1 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities

for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.

ﬁve stars were chosen as comparison star candidates which were previously determined by

PB93 (C1, C2, C3, C5 and C6: Fig.1, therein). After investigating all comparison candidates

for a possible variability, we decided to use C3 as the comparison, and we determined the

diﬀerential magnitudes for UU Sge as plotted in Fig.1.

We have determined the depth of the total eclipse to be 4.450±0.075 and 3.764±0.074

mag for V– and R–passband, respectively. The depth for the V –passband is somewhat

larger than that of BPH94. The time diﬀerence between the fourth and ﬁrst-contact points

was determined as ∼1.26 hour, and the duration of the total eclipse at the bottom of the

primary minimum was estimated as ∼13.4 min. Not only the short time length but also the

integration time increase at the bottom of the total eclipse, with a relatively long uploading

time of the camera, brought about to obtain only a few data points in conjunction. Moreover,

the minimum brightness of UU Sge is close to the magnitude limit (in case of photometry)

for a 1.5-m telescope, which led to have scattered data points at the primary conjunction

with errors around as much as 0.06 mag.

2.2 V477 Lyr

Two–passband (Johnson V and R) CCD photometric observations of V477 Lyr were carried

out using the same setup as described for UU Sge. We observed the system during the nights

from 2002 August 6 to 10. V477 Lyr has a partial eclipse at the primary minimum and it is

not as deep as that of UU Sge. We set the exposure time as 60 s during the overall phases.

The ephemeris used to phase the data was taken from Kiss et al. (2000),

HJD (Min.I) = 2451766.4038 + 0.47172909E d.

After bias subtraction and ﬂat-ﬁelding, the data reduction was performed applying the

aperture photometry package of IRAF/APPHOT. The magnitudes of the stars including V477

Lyr and other ﬁve comparison candidates, which were previously found to be constant by

PB94 (C1, C3, C4, C5 and C6: Fig.1, therein), were measured. The errors of the magnitude

measurements at primary minima did not exceed 0.018 and 0.010 mag in V– and R–passband,

respectively. The diﬀerential magnitudes were computed with respect to the comparison star

C6. The light curves of the system obtained in V– and R–passband are shown in Fig.2.

3 REANALYSIS OF THE RADIAL VELOCITIES

The ﬁrst radial velocities of UU Sge and V477 Lyr were previously obtained and published

by PB93 and PB94, respectively. By using both absorption and emission lines (which move

in anti–phase with the absorption lines and thought to originate on or very close to the

surface of the secondary component) they measured the radial velocities of the systems.

They used one of the spectra of the related object (UU Sge or V477 Lyr) as a template to

calculate the cross–correlations. Therefore, as mentioned by the authors, only the estimates

of the velocity semi–amplitudes are meaningful while the systematic velocities of the systems

remain unknown. That is why we were not be able to make simultaneous light and velocity

curve solutions. However, we reanalysed the radial velocities by using the corrected radial

velocity data given by PB93 and PB94 in order to increase the precision of the parameters

and used them as inputs during the simultaneous solution of the two–colour light curves. The

revised results of the radial velocity curve solutions are given in Table 1. The parameters K1

and K2 stand for the velocity semi–amplitudes of the primary and secondary components,

q is the mass ratio (M2/M1) and a is the projected semimajor axis of the related system’s

orbit.

4 SIMULTANEOUS LIGHT CURVE SOLUTIONS

4.1 UU Sge

We have performed a simultaneous solution of the V– and R–passband light curves by

employing the updated (2003) version of Wilson-Devinney (Wilson & Devinney 1971, Wilson

1979, 1990, 2003) code (hereafter W–D). This program is written for the analysis of light and

velocity curves of binary stars which have either circular or eccentric orbits. The program has

diﬀerent ‘modes’ in terms of Roche lobe ﬁlling conditions of the components. Examination

of the light curve of UU Sge revealed a detached system and a circular orbit as expected for

such a close binary. Therefore, we used ‘Mode 2’ which is developed for detached binaries.

Since the reﬂection eﬀect is highly strong as seen in the light curves, a detailed treatment

to the reﬂection eﬀect was applied during the solutions.

The close binary systems, such as PNNi or post-CE (post-common envelope) binaries

(subdwarf or white dwarf (WD) primary + low mass secondary) have large eﬀective temper-

ature diﬀerences between the components and show extreme reﬂection eﬀects in their light

curves due to irradiation around the substellar points of the cool secondaries. The modeling

of the light curves of such systems is quite diﬃcult and requires special treatment. As dis-

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

Two-colour photometry of UU Sge and V477 Lyr

cussed by Hilditch et al. (1996), the temperature on the irradiated hemisphere of the cool

secondary star is highly enhanced, therefore, contrary to the expected values (A2=0.5, as

generally assumed for cool stars) an albedo around or greater than one (A2>1) is needed for

securing a good ﬁt to the detailed shape of the reﬂection eﬀect (see also Wood et al. 1993).

Previous studies also showed that the negative values of the limb-darkening coeﬃcients are

needed (limb-brightening, e.g. PB94, BPH94) due to same reason of obtaining more precise

modeling of the light curves. In fact, by adopting negative limb-darkening coeﬃcients for the

secondary components of UU Sge and V477 Lyr, BPH94 and PB94 achieved more reasonable

light curve solutions for albedo values greater than one.

We have performed a number of solutions by taking into account the previous approaches

to the light curve modeling of the similar systems. The mass ratio ‘q’ obtained from the radial

velocity analysis, the gravity brightening exponents of the components (g1=1.0 and g2=0.32),

and the bolometric albedo of the primary component (A1=1) were held ﬁxed in the simul-

taneous solutions. Our ﬁrst attempt to solve the light curves by using the square–root limb–

darkening coeﬃcients did not yield a rational solution, thence we decided to use linear limb–

darkening law. The wavelength-speciﬁc linear limb–darkening coeﬃcients of the hot compan-

ion were adopted as 0.10 and 0.07 for x1(V) and x1(R), respectively. These values were as-

sumed using the tables given by D´ıaz-Cordov´es et al. (1995) and Claret et al. (1995). Linear

bolometric limb–darkening coeﬃcients for both components were adopted from Van Hamme

(1993, note that the limb-darkening coeﬃcients given in these tables are calculated for up to an eﬀective temperature of 50 000 K, therefore in this paper, the bolometric limb-darkening coeﬃcient for the primary component was always kept at a value that corresponds to 50 000 K).

Kurucz atmosphere models (Kurucz 1993) were used for both stars during the solutions. The

adjusted parameters were the orbital inclination (i), the mean eﬀective temperature of the

secondary, (T2–not including the eﬀects that may inﬂuence the shape of the light curve such

as reﬂection or spots), surface potentials of the components (Ω1, Ω2), bandpass luminosity of

the primary component (L1), bolometric albedo of the secondary component (A2), and the

wavelength-speciﬁc linear limb–darkening coeﬃcients of the secondary component (x2(V),

x2(R) : the input values were taken from Claret (1998)). The main criterion to secure a rea-

sonable solution was to achieve a physically realistic value for the albedo of the secondary

component (0.56A261.0). This criterion allowed us to set a lower limit for the temperature

of the primary component, T1, and solution trials were started with a temperature of T1=73

000 K. So as to ﬁnd the best solution, trials were made between the temperatures of 73

000 and 85 000 K. The temperature of the secondary component was ﬁrst adopted as 3500

K considering the expected value of such a low mass star. Iterations were carried out until

the convergence was reached at the smallest value for the residual sum of squares (rss).

Although the solution trials have yielded parameters that are capable of modeling the light

curves almost equal in appearance, we have achieved the best ﬁt around the secondary min-

imum for a primary temperature of 78 000 K and a secondary temperature of 6136±80 K,

where the rss value was at a minimum among other temperatures adopted in the solutions.

Examination of T1 – rss variation yielded an approximate error of 3000 K for the hot com-

ponent’s temperature. The uncertainty in the temperature of the secondary component, 80

K, is the formal 1σ error from the solution. The corrected error can be estimated as 240 K

based on the uncertainty of 3000 K in the eﬀective temperature of the primary. The results

of the best solution are given in Table 2 (adjusted parameters have standard errors provided

by the W–D code). The light curves and the computed ﬁts are plotted in Fig.3. Some of the

astrophysical parameters for the components were calculated and are provided in Table 3.

The mass of the secondary component seems considerably low compared to the mass of a

main–sequence star with the same temperature. If we assume that the mass of the secondary

component has not changed dramatically by the end of the CE interaction and it is just a

low–mass main–sequence star, then the temperature seems signiﬁcantly higher than that

expected from an M type dwarf. The possible reasons which could explain this contradiction

are discussed in § 6.

Since the simultaneous two–colour light curve solution gives us an opportunity to con-

strain the temperatures of the components, we believe that the temperatures derived in this

paper are more accurate than the temperatures reported in previous studies. For example,

Walton et al. (1993) suggested a primary component temperature of 50 000 K by comparing

the merged ultraviolet spectrum with Kurucz (1991) LTE model atmospheres. They also

obtained the spectrum of the secondary component during the primary eclipse (with some

contamination from the sdO star) and assuming that the secondary is a main sequence star

they classiﬁed it as G7 with an uncertainty of three spectral subclasses. BPH94 also took

some spectra of the cool component during the primary minima. They used ATLAS6 computer

code (Kurucz 1979) and generated several atmosphere models to ﬁnd the best ﬁt to the

spectrum of the secondary. Under the assumption that the secondary is a main sequence

star they determined a temperature of 6250±250 K. They used this value to reanalyse the

light curve of UU Sge obtained by PB93 and gave two diﬀerent results for the primary com-

ponent temperature as 57 000±8000 and 87 000±13 000 K, in terms of limb-darkening and

brightening approximation, respectively.

The limb–darkening coeﬃcients of the secondary component obtained from the solution

signiﬁcantly diﬀer from those given by Claret (1998). If we compare our values with pub-

lished ones, we see that the V–passband linear limb–darkening coeﬃcient corresponds to a

temperature of ∼10 000 K. The R–passband linear limb–darkening coeﬃcient has a negative

value and has no reference in the published tables. The only explanation we could make for

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

 
12 M. Af¸sar and C. ˙Ibanoˇglu

such limb–darkening coeﬃcients would be the reﬂection eﬀect emanated from the overheated

face of the secondary, which gives rise to the “limb–brightening eﬀect”.

There are several studies concerning the limb–darkening coeﬃcients of illuminated atmo-

spheres (e.g. Peraiah 1983, Claret 2004, Alencar & Vaz 1999). According to Alencar & Vaz

(1999), as the illumination ﬂux increases, the temperature distribution in the atmosphere

of the secondary component becomes more homogeneous, in other words, center-to-limb

brightness variation or center-to-limb-darkening over the stellar disk is removed. The ob-

served increase in the intensity of the brightness of the secondary star from its center to

its limb may be explained in terms of horizontal energy transport (Bond & Grauer 1987).

On the other hand, the limb–darkening/brightening coeﬃcients for the systems that have

strongly irradiated atmospheres still need further investigation.

4.2 V477 Lyr

We have analysed the V– and R–passband light curves of V477 Lyr using the same code

as described in the previous section. A series of simultaneous solution trials for a large

temperature range of the primary component were performed. In order to obtain the best

and realistic solution, we took into account the same criterion for the albedo of the secondary

component, as we did for UU Sge. This criterion enable us to adopt a starting point for

the temperature of hot component as 45 000 K. The ﬁxed and adjusted parameters were

the same as described for UU Sge. Similarly, we ﬁrst attempted to apply the square root

limb–darkening law during the solutions, as suggested by several authors for the stars have

temperatures higher than 8000 K (e.g. Claret 1998), but we could not reach a rational

solution and decided to apply the linear limb–darkening law. The input linear limb–darkening

coeﬃcients for the primary and secondary components were taken from the tables published

by D´ıaz-Cordov´es et al. (1995), Claret et al. (1995) and Claret (1998). Solution trials were

made for the temperatures between 45 000 and 80 000 K. The best solution was achieved

for the temperature of 49 500 K, where the rss value was at a minimum. And, the error

in the temperature of the hot component was estimated as 4500 K from the examination

of T1 – rss variation. The observed and computed light curves are given in Fig.4 and the

parameters are listed in Table 2.

The linear limb-darkening coeﬃcients derived from the solution exhibit a noteworthy

discrepancy from those published ones that mentioned above. The cool component acts like

a very hot star due to the reﬂection eﬀect caused by the subdwarf primary. The heating on

the hemisphere of the secondary star that faces to hot primary is such vigorous that the

irradiation aﬀects the limb-darkening over the stellar surface. Considering the grazing nature

of the secondary eclipse, Bond & Grauer (1987) made an interpretation on the eﬀectiveness

of the reﬂection eﬀect on V477 Lyr and suggested that the horizontal energy transport in

the atmosphere of the secondary component might be the reason for the brighter limb.

To determine the temperature of the subdwarf companion, Kaler (1983) computed the
Zanstra temperatures using the H and He ii nebular lines and constrained the primary

component’s temperature in between 32 000 and 60 000 K. In a most recent study, PB94
presented a new Zanstra analysis based on the Hβ and He ii nebular lines and estimated

the temperatures as 48 000 and 82 000 K, respectively. They also employed the R–technique

of Sch¨onberner & Drilling (1984) and derived a temperature of 63 000 ±12 000 K for the

primary star and considering the temperature range found from several methods they de-

cided to adopt a temperature of 60 000±10 000 K in the light curve analysis. However, the

simultaneous two–colour photometry gives us an opportunity to derive more accurate and

approximate values for the temperatures of the binary components, which we have found as

49 500 K (ﬁxed) for the primary and 3874±120 K for the secondary star. The uncertainty

of 120 K is the formal 1σ error from the solution. The corrected error can be estimated as

350 K based on the uncertainty of 4500 K in the eﬀective temperature of the primary. The

computed astrophysical parameters are given in Table 3. In fact, the mass of the secondary

component corresponds to an M type star (as in the case of UU Sge) and a lower temper-

ature is required for a main–sequence star at the same mass. One of the reasons why we

could not reach such an expected temperature is the limb–brightening phenomenon, which

takes place on the overheated hemisphere of the cool components.

5 THE REFLECTION EFFECT AND THE ENHANCED EFFECTIVE

TEMPERATURES OF THE SECONDARY COMPONENTS

The hot subdwarf components of UU Sge and V477 Lyr, which are also responsible for the

excitation of the nebulae, overheat the hemispheres facing to the substellar points of the cool

components and the reﬂection eﬀect reveals itself on the light curves’ maxima as a sine–like

distortion with large amplitudes (Figs. 1 and 2). The irradiation on the secondary compo-

nents signiﬁcantly increases the temperature around the substellar points. To estimate the

reﬂection rates we applied Fourier analysis to the out-of-eclipse variation of the light curves

and the following truncated Fourier series was used to compute the Fourier coeﬃcients,

l = A0 + A1cosθ + A2cos2θ + B1sinθ + B2sin2θ.

(1)

In this equation, l is the normalized intensity, θ is the phase in degrees, A0 is the normaliza-

tion level for the intensity, A1 and A2 are the contribution to the reﬂection eﬀect. B1 and

B2 are the coeﬃcients represent the other perturbations on the light curve. The normalized

Fourier coeﬃcients of UU Sge and V477 Lyr for both passbands are listed in Table 4. The

B coeﬃcients have signiﬁcantly smaller values than other coeﬃcients, which indicate that

other perturbations have no remarkable inﬂuence on the light curves other than reﬂection

eﬀect.

We have computed the amplitudes of the sine–like distortions caused by the reﬂection

eﬀect by using the Fourier coeﬃcients of related systems. The amplitudes for UU Sge were

found to be 0.396 mag and 0.446 mag in V– and R–passband, respectively. The amplitude

found in V–passband light curve seems in very good agreement with that of derived by

PB93. In the case of V477 Lyr, the amplitudes in V– and R–passband were estimated to be

0.588 mag and 0.665 mag, in fair agreement with that of obtained by PB94.

We have tried to estimate the maximum temperature values, T2h, around the substellar

points of the secondary components by employing the following equation;

Where R1, R2 are the radii and T1, T2 are the eﬀective temperatures of the primary

and the secondary components, respectively; ∆m is the amplitude of the brightness vari-

ation from minimum (θ=0◦, mid-primary) to maximum (θ=180◦, mid-secondary) of the

sine–like distortion, and φ is the approximate central angle viewed from the centre of the

secondary, which corresponds to the irradiated area over the surface of the secondary star

(see Exter et al. 2005). We have determined the V– and R–passband substellar–point tem-

peratures of the cool components of UU Sge to be around 30 680 K and 31 800 K, and of

V477 Lyr to be around 16 860 and 17 550 K, respectively. These estimates agree well with

those of computed by the equation described in Exter et al. (2005).

6 OVERSIZED RADII OF THE SECONDARY COMPONENTS AND

EVOLUTIONARY STATUS OF THE SYSTEMS

Radii of the secondary components of UU Sge and V477 Lyr have been found to be larger

than those expected for main–sequence stars at the same masses. On the other hand, our

targets are not the only examples for such systems that contain oversized secondaries. In this

section, we discuss the possible reasons on the oversized nature of the late-type secondary

components of our targets along with some other selected PNNi and post–CE systems (listed

in Table 5). Although the mass of the secondary component of V471 Tau is almost three times

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

16 M. Af¸sar and C. ˙Ibanoˇglu

the masses of other secondaries studied here, we have especially included this well–studied

system for comparison. In a study made by O’Brien et al. (2001), two possible reasons for

the expanded radius of the K–type secondary of V471 Tau were accentuated: (1) because of

the possible CE phase, which V471 Tau might have recently emerged from, the secondary

star may be still out of thermal equilibrium or (2) the starspots covering the surface of the

star prevent the convective energy from being transported, which as a result increase the

radius of the star.

The CE evolution and its eﬀect on the low–mass main–sequence secondary components

are the phenomena that have been poorly understood both theoretically and observationally.

If a close binary system, consisting of a WD primary and a red dwarf (RD) secondary, have

once undergone a CE phase, the mass and the radius of the secondary component might

have been changed due to mass transfer during the formation of the CE. Although there

remain questions on whether the mass of the secondary component alters dramatically or

does not change in a substantial manner, there are observational evidences which show the

signiﬁcant changes in the radius of the component, such as the systems given in this paper.

There are several theoretical studies that have focused upon the response of the secondary

component to the accretion process during the CE evolution. Prialnik & Livio (1985) made

some evolutionary calculations for a 0.2 M⊙ fully convective star which accretes matter at

several rates and investigated the outcome of the accretion. They found that in the models

with accretion rates around 10−4–10−5 M⊙ yr−1, the incoming material accumulates faster

than the contraction rate, and consequently the outer radius increases. In their models the

ﬁnal value of the accumulated matter reaches to 2.5×10−3 M⊙, which basically indicates

that the mass of the fully convective star remains almost unchanged. They also concluded

that the results should be valid for all fully convective stars (.0.3 M⊙) as well as for the

stars with deep convective envelopes (0.3 M⊙.M.0.5 M⊙). In a similar study carried out by

Sarna & Zi´o lkowski (1988), the eﬀect of rapid mass accretion onto low–mass main–sequence

stars (0.3 M⊙–0.5 M⊙) was investigated. They, too, came to a similar conclusion and in-

dicated that the stars with deep convective envelopes experiencing rapid mass accretion

signiﬁcantly increase their radii. Another study published by Hjellming & Taam (1991) also

probed the response of a 1.25 M⊙ main–sequence star to the conditions within the CE. At a
range of relatively high accretion rates (10−5 to 10−1 M⊙ yr−1), they found that the radius of

the secondary component can expand ten times larger than its main–sequence radius upon

mass accretion of less than 0.1 M⊙. After ﬁlling its Roche lobe, the secondary loses back

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

Two-colour photometry of UU Sge and V477 Lyr

17

almost all the mass it has accreted and only a small amount of mass (.0.01 M⊙) remains

accumulated after emergence from the envelope. As a result, the surface layers of the sec-

ondary depart from thermal equilibrium and enter in a thermally relaxation stage with a

radius larger than its initial main–sequence radius. On the other hand, the results of some

three–dimensional hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. Sandquist et al. 1998) reveal that the

evolution of the CE phase takes place in short dynamic time scales and the secondary star

which moves rapidly (supersonic) in the CE leaves this stage almost without mass accretion.

However, the cases we will discuss in the following paragraphs involve the possible small

amount of mass accretion by the cool companion.

The second reason which has been considered as a process to increase the radii of the

low-mass secondary components is the eﬀectiveness of the magnetic activity. There are sev-

eral studies on low–mass main–sequence stars, which compare the physical properties of

magnetically active and inactive stars. Mullan & MacDonald (2001) showed that, among

the stars at the same masses, active stars are cooler and have larger radii than inactive

stars. In a most recent study Morales et al. (2008) concluded that all active low–mass stars

(including low–mass eclipsing binaries) are cooler than inactive stars of similar luminosity

and hence have larger radii.

Recently, De Marco et al. (2008) have discussed the importance of the irradiation eﬀect

in binary PNNi and suggested that the heating which takes eﬀect on the ‘day side’ of the

secondary stars might cause a puﬃng up and expand the surface layers of the secondaries.

By taking into consideration two of the reasons summarized above, we have carried out

some calculations to study the evolutionary status of some selected post–CE systems and

interpreted which reason may be responsible for the cool components to have oversized radii:

incomplete thermal relaxation or presence of magnetically active regions.

KV Vel : The binary nucleus of the PN DS 1. The sdO star was discovered by Drilling

(1983) and double–lined spectroscopic variations with a period of 8.571 hour were found

by Drilling (1985). Later, the renewed results for the system parameters were published by

Hilditch et al. (1996).

BE UMa : It is an eclipsing binary nucleus. Although the light variability of the system

was ﬁrst noted by Kurochkin (1964) and an eclipse was ﬁrst observed by Ando et al. (1982),

the nebula surrounds the binary nucleus was discovered by Liebert et al. (1995). The system

parameters listed in Table 5 and 6 have been adopted from Ferguson et al. (1999).

HS 1136+6646 : Discovered as a spectroscopic binary by Heber et al. (1996) and more

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

18 M. Af¸sar and C. ˙Ibanoˇglu

recently Sing et al. (2004) have indicated that the double–lined spectroscopic system is a

newly formed post-CE binary.

PG 1026+002 : The system, which consists of a WD primary and a RD secondary,

was discovered during the Palomar Green Survey (Green et al. 1986). Saﬀer et al. (1993)

reported that the system is a single–lined spectroscopic binary and the secondary compo-

nent’s radius is compatible with its mass. However, by using the R–passband light curve

of the system Bruch & Diaz (1999) found the radius of the secondary as being larger than

expected from the theoretical models.

RR Cae : An eclipsing WD–M dwarf binary system with a period of 7.3 hour. The

eclipses were ﬁrst observed by Krzeminski (1984). Bruch (1999) analysed the radial velocity

measurements together with the photometric data of Bruch & Diaz (1998) and found that

the radius of the M dwarf is larger as compared with a main–sequence star at the same

mass. However, in a more recent study, Maxted et al. (2007) presented new photometry and

double–lined spectroscopy of the system and concluded that, contrary to Bruch (1999), the

radius of the secondary is consistent with its mass. By taking into account the discrepancy

between these two results we have performed two separate calculations.

RE 1016-053 : Post-CE binary consists of a WD primary and a RD secondary. Two diﬀer-

ent values for the secondary star’s radius were given by Wood et al. (1999) and Vennes et al.

(1999) depending on two diﬀerent spectral analysis and the radius of the secondary compo-

nent was found as slightly oversized. Both radii have been considered here and the results

are listed in Table 5.

V471 Tau : Is a well-known post-CE binary system (WD primary + RD secondary)

and a member of the Hyades star cluster. The system has a period of 12.5 hour and being
observed since the discovery of its eclipses by Nelson & Young (1970). ˙Ibanoˇglu et al. (1994)

showed that the RD secondary is an active star. Possible reasons for the expanded radius of

the secondary component were discussed by O’Brien et al. (2001) and they attributed the

expansion to the magnetic activity which originates from the starspots partially covering

the surface of the star.

We have used the models (age of 1 Gyr, [M/H]=0.0) provided by Chabrier & Baraﬀe

(1997, hereafter CB97) to ﬁnd the “expected” radii, temperatures and luminosities of the

secondary components. The models have been ﬁtted by sixth-degree polynomials and these

equations have been used to calculate the “expected” radii (R2,teo) given in Table 5 (along

with “observed” ones). The mass–radius relationship of CB97 is plotted in Figure 5 and

larger radii (2 or higher) than the radii of their main–sequence equivalents.

Figure 7. Mass–luminosity relationship for the low mass main–sequence stars. The symbols are the same as in Figure 5.

The locations of the secondary companions are illustrated in the mass–temperature (M–

Te) and mass–luminosity (M–L) planes in Figs. 6 and 7. Since the eﬀective temperatures

could not be determined for the secondary stars of HS 1136+6646 and RE 1016-053, the

suggested spectral types taken from the referred papers are given in Table 5. In order to

plot these stars in the M–Te and M–L planes we adopted the eﬀective temperatures from

the tables given by Leggett (1992). The temperatures of 3800 K for K7 classiﬁcation of HS

1136+6646, 3300 K and 3100 K for M3 and M5 classiﬁcations of RE 1016-053 were used in

our calculations.

In order to have an idea on the thermal relaxation time–scale (tth) of the envelope

(accumulated matter) which was formed during the mass transfer from the primary to the

secondary, we have used tth equation given by Prialnik & Livio (1985):

tth ≃ GMMenv∆R/R2L.

(3)

Where M and R is the secondary’s mass and “expected” radius, Menv is the mass of the

envelope due to mass accretion, ∆R is the width of the envelope and L is the bolometric

luminosity of the secondary star.

Following the theoretical studies mentioned in earlier paragraphs we have assumed three

Menv values which may have been accumulated by the secondary star: 0.05, 0.01 and 0.005

M⊙. Then we have calculated the tth for each assumption. The results are given in Table 5

as tth,0.05, tth,0.01 and tth,0.005.

other properties given in this table please see the references given in Table 5). (1) Sch¨onberner (1983), (2) AB98, (3) BA98.

Since it is very important to know the critical accretion rates, we have also calculated the

Eddington luminosities of the secondary stars. We have found the critical accretion rates

to be of the order of a few 10−4 M⊙ yr−1. Therefore, it is acceptable to consider a mass
accretion onto secondary components as rapid as a few 10−5 M⊙ yr−1, which is an adequate

accretion rate leads to increase in the radii of the cool components as previously discussed

by Prialnik & Livio (1985).

For the binary nuclei, UU Sge, V477 Lyr, KV Vel and BE UMa, the presence of the

PN warrants us in estimating the ages (the time since the emergence from the CE) of the

systems as a few 104 yr (30 000 – 40 000 yr, Sch¨onberner 1983, Soker 2006). So, we have

simply adopted the ages as 3×104 yr for all the nuclei (Table 6). However, we have used

the evolutionary tracks computed by Bl¨ocker (1995), and showed the possible evolutionary

states of the sdO componets of UU Sge and V477 Lyr in Fig. 8. Although these models

were computed for PNe with single nuclei, the loci of the sdO components seem in fairly

well agreement (within the uncertainties given for the masses of sdO components) with the

models have remnant masses of 0.625 and 0.524 M⊙, which evolved from the initial ZAMS

masses of 3 and 1 M⊙, respectively. In these models, the remnants have CO cores and the

nuclear energy is mainly provided by the He shell burning. Besides all these approaches,

we are aware of the fact that our systems are not PNe with “single” nuclei, and binarity

may have inﬂuenced the evolution of the components through the interaction between the

components and formation of the CE (more details on the evolution of PNe and CE can be

found in the referred papers), as much as the diﬀerent mass–loss rates the systems might

have encountered.

For the other systems studied here we have used the white dwarf evolutionary models

from Althaus & Benvenuto (1998, hereafter AB98) and Benvenuto & Althaus (1998, hereafter BA98)

to calculate the approximate cooling ages, tcool. In AB98, the evolutionary models were

computed for the carbon–oxygen WD masses within the range of 0.5–1.2 M⊙ and surface
hydrogen layer masses ranging between 10−13 and 10−4 MH/M, where M is the mass of the

modeled WD and MH is the mass of the H envelope. BA98 developed the models for the

evolution of helium WDs with masses ranging from 0.15 to 0.5 M⊙, and having outer H
envelope masses within the range of 10−8 6MH/M6 4×10−3. And both WD models were

improved for the metallicities of Z=0.0 and Z=0.001.

For the primary masses higher and lower than 0.5 M⊙, we have used the tables given

by AB98 and BA98, respectively. Various MH/M and both Z values have been taken into

account and the models have been examined in Te–log g plane. The most applicable models

have been selected and interpolated for the related primary masses in order to estimate

the cooling ages of the WDs. We have found that the models for V471 Tau and RR Cae

having the surface hydrogen layer mass of 10−4 MH/M give the best agreement in Te–log g

plane for the metallicities of Z=0.0 and Z=0.001, respectively. However, other systems seem

consistent with the models have surface hydrogen layer mass of 10−6 MH/M and metallicity

of Z=0.001. Resultant tcool values are listed in Table 6.

Since our goal is to search for the more plausible reason on the oversized nature of the

secondaries, we have compared tth with the ages of the systems as summarized below:

UU Sge, V477 Lyr, KV Vel and BE UMa : The thermal relaxation time–scales calculated

for each of the envelope masses are relatively longer than the ages of the systems, which

indicate that the surface of the secondary components have not yet reached the thermal

equilibrium. The discrepancy between the “observed” and the “expected” radii of the secon-

daries can be seen in Fig. 5. The diﬀerence of the eﬀective temperatures from the theoretical

ones is also notable (Fig. 6).

HS 1136+6646 : The comparison of tth and tcool of the system shows that surface layers

of the system is still in a thermally relaxation stage which causes the expansion in the radius

of the secondary. Also the adopted eﬀective temperature which corresponds to a K7 star is

located above the theoretical ﬁt and appears to be in agreement with this approach.

PG 1026+002 : When the computed tth values are compared with tcool of the system,

depending on the envelope mass, the secondary component seems to be either at the end

of its thermally relaxation stage or just passed it. However, the low eﬀective temperature

of the secondary component may be taken as support for the idea that the reason for the

expanded radius is the presence of the possible magnetically active regions on the secondary

star.

RR Cae : For the parameters given by Bruch (1999), the thermal relaxation time–scales

for the secondary component of RR Cae are shorter than the cooling age of the system.

The inconsistency both in radius and eﬀective temperature with the theoretical expectations

indicates the presence of the possible stellar activity. On the other hand, the posibility of the

higher amount of matter (at least 0.1 M⊙) being accreted by the secondary leaves a question

mark that the cool component might be still out of thermal equilibrium. Maxted et al. (2007)

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

24 M. Af¸sar and C. ˙Ibanoˇglu

found the radius consistent with the theoretical expectations as seen in Fig. 5. But there

seems to be a disagreement between eﬀective temperature and its expected counterpart,

which also supports the assumption of the presence of active regions. Because the mass of

the secondary component is twice as much of the mass found by Bruch (1999), tth values

are relatively well below the cooling age of the system.

RE 1016-053 : There is an interesting result for the secondary star of RE 1016-053. The

radius of the cool component (taken from both Wood et al. 1999 and Vennes et al. 1999)

has larger values than expected according to the mass–radius relationship of CB97 and the

comparison of the thermal relaxation time–scales with the cooling age of the system shows

that the secondary star still may have thermal instability on its surface layers. But the

adopted eﬀective temperatures seem to be a little lower than expected, which could tell us

the possibility of having active regions on the surface of the secondary if we would have

lower tth values than tcool. However, our calculations indicate a secondary star which is far

from being thermally relaxed that makes us to expect higher eﬀective temperatures. Since

the eﬀective temperatures have been determined from the spectral types estimated by the

authors (Wood et al. 1999 and Vennes et al. 1999) and they suggest these spectral types re-

lying on the masses of the secondary star, we believe this is due to probable underestimation

of either spectral types or the masses.

V471 Tau : Our ﬁndings on this well-known post-CE system are listed in Table 5 and

6, but since the mass of the secondary component is higher than the rest of the secondaries

studied here, it is not plotted in Figs. 5, 6 and 7. It is obvious that the secondary component

passed its thermally relaxation stage relatively long ago. Nonetheless, its radius seems a

little larger and the eﬀective temperature seems a little lower. These results are in fairly well

agreement with those presented by O’Brien et al. (2001).

7 THE EFFICIENCY PARAMETER : “αCE”

The CE evolution is one of the most crucial part in the evolution of binary systems. The

presence of close binaries, for example, consisting of a WD primary and a RD secondary, in-

dicates that the wide precursor system must have undergone a signiﬁcant amount of angular

momentum loss which causes the orbital shrinkage.

At some stage of the evolution, more massive primary component evolves to AGB (or

RGB, depending on the initial conﬁguration of the system) and ﬁlls its Roche lobe which

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

Two-colour photometry of UU Sge and V477 Lyr

25

leads to mass transfer towards the secondary component. If the mass transfer is unstable the

secondary star can not accommodate the accreted matter at its surface and both components

are engulfed by the primary’s envelope which is later on being called as CE. Since the CE

does not corotate with the orbiting binary core, the frictional forces arise due to velocity

diﬀerence. This frictional interaction produces gravitational drag that causes components

to spiral-in together and reduces the binary separation. The change in orbital separation

results in the change in orbital energy and a fraction of the diﬀerence in orbital energy

is used to eject the envelope from the system by depositing it into CE. This fraction is

designated as the “eﬃcency” parameter and denoted by “αCE” (e.g. Tutukov & Yungelson

1979, Iben & Livio 1993, and references therein)

αCE =

∆Ebind
∆Eorb

,

(4)

where ∆Ebind is the diﬀerence between gravitational and thermal energy of the ejected

envelope at the beginning of Roche lobe overﬂow (RLOF) and ∆Eorb is the orbital energy

diﬀerence between the beginning and at the end of the spiralling-in process of the binary

system.

One of the main goals of this paper is to make a contribution to the studies which

search for the limits to constrain the value of “αCE” parameter. We have mainly followed

the approximations given by, e.g., Webbink (2008), Han et al. (1995), Dewi & Tauris (2000),

De Kool (1990) in order to estimate the “eﬃcency” parameters for UU Sge and V477 Lyr.

We assume that the secondary components are main–sequence stars and have not been

aﬀected by the CE interaction. For the estimation of the binding energy of the envelope

(∆Ebind) we have used the following equation

∆Ebind = −

GM1Menv
λRL

,

(5)

where M1 is the mass of AGB star (also assumed as the initial mass of the primary com-

ponent), Menv = M1 – Mcore, is the envelope mass of AGB star, Mcore is the current mass

of the primary, RL is the Roche lobe radius of the primary (at the onset of mass transfer)

and λ is a dimensionless parameter which depends on the detailed structure of the enve-

lope and the stellar density distribution. According to Webbink (2007), λ is a function of

me≡Menv/M1=1–(Mcore/M1), and is well–approximated by

λ−1 ≈ 3.000 − 3.816me + 1.041me

2 + 0.067me

3 + 0.136me

The total change in orbital energy is

,

(7)

where M2 is the mass of secondary component, a0 is the initial separation of the binary

system, and af is the ﬁnal orbital separation.

In order to calculate these energies one needs to estimate the initial parameters of the

binary systems. As a ﬁrst conjecture for the initial masses of the primaries we have made use

of the evolutionary tracks of Bl¨ocker (1995). However, by taking into consideration that the

RLOF may occur at diﬀerent stages of the binary evolution we have also used the initial/ﬁnal

mass relations given by Iben & Tutukov (1986) (also see Iben & Livio 1993). If the compo-

nents experience a case–C RLOF (primary ﬁlls its Roche lobe during the He–shell burning)

then the mass of the remnant is related to initial mass of the primary by MCO≈0.5+0.16(M1

– 2.3) if 2.3<M1<4.2 (the masses are in solar units) and by MCO≈0.8+0.0875(M1 – 4.2) if

4.2<M1<7.6. If the binary system experiences a late case–B RLOF (primary ﬁlls its Roche

lobe shortly before the He ignition, He core is non–degenerate at this point), a degener-

ate CO or a “hybrid (C+O+He)” remnant develops with an initial/ﬁnal mass relation of

MCO≈0.167M1 – 0.085 if 2.3<M1<5, and MCO≈0.4+0.07M1 for the range of 5<M1<10.

Considering the diﬀerent stages of RLOF mentioned above, let us ﬁrst investigate the

case–C RLOF in which the primary components of UU Sge and V477 Lyr are CO cores.

Then the initial masses of the primary stars can be estimated as ≈3.1 M⊙ and ≈2.35 M⊙,

respectively. If we assume that the systems have experienced a case–B RLOF and become

degenerate CO or hybrid cores, then the initial masses of the primary components must

have been around 4.2 M⊙ and 3.5 M⊙, respectively. By taking these masses as limits for

the progenitors of the primaries we have performed a series of calculations to estimate the

αCE parameters of the systems (following a somewhat similar work to that of O’Brien et al.

2001).

We used the theoretical AGB core mass–luminosity approximation given by Iben &

Tutukov (1984, 1985, 1993);

LAGB = 6 × 104(MCO/M⊙ − 0.5),

(8)

where LAGB is the maximum luminosity for a post-AGB star during the plateau phase of its

evolution and also the luminosity at the time of RLOF. Applying this approximation, LAGB

values for the current primary masses of UU Sge and V477 Lyr can be calculated as 7680

and 480 L⊙, respectively.

* The sdO component has been assumed as a degenerate “He” dwarf.

The AGB radii of the primaries have been estimated using the AGB mass–luminosity–

radius relation proposed by Hurley et al. (2000);

RAGB = 1.125M −0.33

1

(L0.4

AGB + 0.383L0.76

AGB),

(9)

where RAGB is the AGB radius that the progenitor might have reached at the stage of RLOF.

The RAGB values calculated for the diﬀerent initial masses are also given in Table 7.

Now we can estimate the initial separations, a0, of the systems with the following formula

(Eggleton 1983)

rL =

0.49q2/3
0.6q2/3 + ln(1 + q1/3)

,

(10)

where rL=RL/a0 is the relative radius of the Roche lobe and q is the mass ratio being equal

to M1/M2. Adopting RL=RAGB the initial separations have been computed for diﬀerent mass

ratios (see Table 7). Equations (5) and (6) have been used for the estimation of the binding

and orbital energies, then the αCE parameters have been determined as listed in Table 7. Pi,

the initial orbital period of the system has been also computed using the Kepler’s third law

and given in Table 7.

The somewhat problematic point here is that the mass of the sdO component of V477 Lyr

is of the order of 0.5 M⊙ which is a critical and controversial value that lies in the transition

region between the masses of CO and He remnants. This situation gives us a chance to

consider the sdO component as a degenerate “He” dwarf which once have a progenitor mass

less than 2.3 M⊙. If we assume that the primary component ﬁlled its Roche lobe right after

it has developed a degenerate “He” core, then we can employ the core–mass–radius relation

given by Iben & Tutukov (1986),

R = 103.5M 4

He.

(11)

Here, R is the radius of primary by the time of RLOF and M He is the current mass of the

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

28 M. Af¸sar and C. ˙Ibanoˇglu

sdO star. By adopting this radius as RL and assuming that the initial mass of the primary

was around 2.2 M⊙ we have calculated the initial parameters and values of αCE for the

system as listed in Table 7.

8 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we report the results of the ﬁrst simultaneous two–passband light curve analy-

sis for the binary PNNi; UU Sge and V477 Lyr. We have also reanalysed the published radial

velocity data (PB93 and PB94) of both systems in order to increase the sensitivity of the

orbital parameters employed in the solution of the light curves. The linear limb–darkening

coeﬃcients were adjusted during the solutions of both systems. Not surprisingly, the resul-

tant coeﬃcients were found to be inconsistent with the theoretically expected ones, which

was interpreted as the presence of the limb–brightening eﬀect due to strong irradiation of

the secondary components. In the case of UU Sge, the best solution was achieved at the

primary temperature of 78 000 K by yielding a secondary component temperature of 6136

K. The temperature of the primary component falls into the temperature range of 87 000 ±

13000 K derived by BPH94. Also the temperature of secondary component indicates a good

agreement with that of 6250 K estimated by BPH94.

We have determined the temperatures of the hot and cool components of V477 Lyr as 49

500 K and 3874 K, respectively. The temperature of the secondary star shows a remarkable

discrepancy in comparison with the temperature of 5300 K derived by PB94. We believe

that having two–passband simultaneous light curve analysis with a diﬀerent approach to

the solutions yielded more realistic results in terms of the temperature of the components

of both systems.

Nevertheless, it has to be stressed that the secondary component temperature of V477

Lyr, in contrary to that of UU Sge, seems much closer to the value of expected from a

main–sequence star at the same mass. The discrepancy between the observed and theoretical

temperatures may be explained in terms of the thermally relaxation stage that the secondary

stars have been shown to be in. The more the mass is accumulated the longer the thermal–

relaxation time scale is needed. During the computations, our main assumption was that

the mass of the secondary stars has not been signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the CE interaction

and the highest value for the mass of the accumulated matter was adopted as 0.05 M⊙.

However, we have to bring into attention that the mass of the secondary components might

Two-colour photometry of UU Sge and V477 Lyr

29

have undergone drastic changes due to accretion, which would also result in the increase of

the luminosity (and the temperature) of the secondary components.

The temperature of the primary component of V477 Lyr indicates a good agreement
with the Hβ Zanstra temperature of 48 000 K while showing a disagreement with the He ii

Zanstra temperature of 82 000 K, those of derived by PB94. 49 500 K also lies in the range of
H and He ii Zanstra temperatures of 32 000 K – 60 000 K determined by Kaler (1983). PB94
mentions the possible He ii stratiﬁcation in the nebula, which leads up to the variety in the
He ii Zanstra temperatures of the sdO component. The mass loss via thermal pulses may

explain the likely He stratiﬁcation and enhanced He abundance (PB94) in the nebula. In
this case, the Zanstra temperature determined from He ii nebular lines could be misleading,

which reveals that the temperature determined by using the H nebular lines may carry more

valuable information on the temperature of the sdO component.

The comparison of the thermal time scales and the post-CE ages of the systems (Ta-

ble 5) indicates that the secondary components of the binary nuclei of the PNe are still

out of thermal equilibrium along with two other post-CE systems: HS 1136+6646 and RE

1016-053. The rest of the systems that have been reported as having oversized secondary

components were found to be thermally relaxed relatively long ago. The oversized nature

and low temperatures of these systems were interpreted as the presence of the possible mag-

netically active regions which cause the increase in the size of a low–mass main sequence

star while reducing its eﬀective temperature. Detailed spectroscopic studies of these systems

are needed.

Finally, we have implemented several calculations to estimate the common envelope eﬃ-

ciency parameter, αCE, of the systems. We have determined various initial system parameters

using possible evolutionary scenarios. The possible eﬃciency parameters for UU Sge were

found in the range of 0.3 < αCE < 1, which is close to the range of previously suggested

by theoretical studies (e.g. Han et al. 1995). Nevertheless, the parameter values that we

have found for V477 Lyr, under the assumption of having CO or C+O+He remnant as the

primary component, indicate a deviation from the theoretical ﬁndings. An αCE > 1 may be

explained as the contribution from other sources (e.g. deposition of recombination energy

into CE ejection, nuclear burning on the surface of the secondary star, see Iben & Livio

(1993) for more detail) to the CE ejection beside the eﬃciency of orbital energy. On the

other hand, it seems impossible to know which mechanism could have been such eﬀective

on the eﬃciency parameter. Therefore, we have found the courage of making a new assump-

c(cid:13) 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

30 M. Af¸sar and C. ˙Ibanoˇglu

tion about the primary component of V477 Lyr. By taking into account its current mass of

0.508 ± 0.046 M⊙, we assumed that the primary component is a degenerate He dwarf with

an initial mass of < 2.3 M⊙. By using the mass–radius relation given by Iben & Tutukov

(1986), we calculated the radius of the primary at the time of RLOF (independently from

its luminosity, see equation (11)). These approaches yielded an eﬃciency parameter of 0.83

which indicates that about 83 percent of the orbital energy were used eﬀectively during the

ejection of the CE.
