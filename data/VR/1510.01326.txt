ABSTRACT
We present the ﬁrst spectroscopic analysis of the faint and compact stellar system
Draco II (Dra II, MV = −2.9 ± 0.8, rh = 19+8
−6 pc), recently discovered in the Pan-
STARRS1 3π survey. The observations, conducted with DEIMOS on the Keck II
telescope, establish some of its basic characteristics: the velocity data reveal a narrow
−1.8 km s−1,
peak with 9 member stars at a systemic heliocentric velocity hvri = −347.6+1.7
thereby conﬁrming Dra II is a satellite of the Milky Way; we infer a velocity dispersion
with σvr = 2.9 ± 2.1 km s−1 (< 8.4 km s−1 at the 95% conﬁdence level), which implies
log10 (cid:0)M1/2(cid:1) = 5.5+0.4
−0.8, in Solar units; furthermore,
very weak Calcium triplet lines in the spectra of the high signal-to-noise member stars
imply [Fe/H] < −2.1, whilst variations in the line strengths of two stars with similar
colours and magnitudes suggest a metallicity spread in Dra II. These new data cannot
clearly discriminate whether Draco II is a star cluster or amongst the faintest, most
compact, and closest dwarf galaxies. However, the sum of the three — individually
inconclusive — pieces of evidence presented here, seems to favour the dwarf galaxy
interpretation.

INTRODUCTION

Systematic surveys of the Milky Way surroundings with
CCD photometry such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Re-
sponse System 1 (Pan-STARRS1 or PS1), and the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) have allowed for the discovery of nu-
merous faint Milky Way satellites in the last decade (e.g.,
Willman et al. 2005; Belokurov et al. 2007; Bechtol et al.
2015; Laevens et al. 2015). Despite sometimes reaching to-
tal luminosities of only ∼ 103 L⊙ (Martin, de Jong, & Rix
2008), a signiﬁcant fraction of these new discoveries are con-
ﬁrmed to be dynamically hotter than implied by their bary-
onic content alone and are thought to be the most dark-
matter dominated dwarf galaxies to orbit the Milky Way
(e.g., Martin et al. 2007; Simon & Geha 2007; Geha et al.
2009; Kirby et al. 2013a). Such systems are particularly

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS

valuable to both understand the faint-end of galaxy for-
mation (e.g., Brown et al. 2014) and hunt for dark mat-
ter annihilation signals as their properties are not ex-
pected to be strongly impacted by baryonic processes (e.g.,
Bonnivard et al. 2015).

However, without spectroscopic observations, assessing
the nature of such stellar systems is rendered diﬃcult by the
apparent merging of the globular cluster and dwarf galaxy
realms at the faint end. Although this eﬀect is likely due in
part to surface brightness limits in the current searches that
translate to only faint and small stellar systems being bright
enough to overcome detection limits (Koposov et al. 2007;
Walsh, Willman, & Jerjen 2009; Drlica-Wagner et al. 2015),
it remains that disentangling currently observed globular
clusters from dwarf galaxies can be challenging. Two such
examples, Draco II (Dra II) and Sagittarius II, are shown

N. F. Martin et al.

in our recent presentation of three faint systems found in
the PS1 3π survey (Laevens et al. 2015). With a total mag-
nitude of MV = −2.9 ± 0.8 (or L⊙ = 103.1±0.3) and a
half-light radius of only rh = 19+8
−6 pc, Dra II is a system
whose properties are similar to those of the dwarf galaxy
Segue 1 (Geha et al. 2009; Simon et al. 2011), but whose
size is smaller than any conﬁrmed dwarf galaxy.

In this letter, we analyze the ﬁrst spectroscopic obser-
vations of Dra II with the DEIMOS multi-object spectro-
graph on Keck II (Faber et al. 2003). The measured veloci-
ties conﬁrm that Dra II is a Milky Way satellite and show
a marginally resolved velocity dispersion. The metallicity
properties of the system further hint that Dra II is likely a
dwarf galaxy. We present our observations and data in Sec-
tion 2, perform the analysis of the data set in Section 3, and
conclude in Section 4.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA

One DEIMOS mask was observed on the night of July
17, 2015, placed close to the center of Dra II in such a
way to optimise the number of high-priority bright candi-
date members. The priorities were set as both a function
of spatial location (higher priority towards the center of
the system) and location in the colour-magnitude diagram
(CMD). All targets are selected using the PS1 photometry
and higher priorities are given to potential main-sequence
(MS), main-sequence turn oﬀ (MSTO) and red-giant-branch
(RGB) stars selected to follow an isochrone that best repro-
duces the CMD features of Dra II. The mask was drilled
with 0.7′′ slits.

Observations were taken following our usual routine
(e.g., Martin et al. 2014) for a total of 3,600s, split into three
1,200s sub-exposures, under good conditions (50% humidity,
0.7′′ seeing). We further observed NeArKrXe calibrations
through the slit mask after the science frames at the same
location on sky. The chosen grating has 1200 lines/mm and

covers the wavelength range 6600–9400

resolution of ∼ 0.33

We process the raw spectra through our own pipeline
that we developed over the years to speciﬁcally handle
DEIMOS data. The details of the pipeline, which focuses on
the Calcium triplet region, are given by Ibata et al. (2011),
to which we add another calibration step using the Fraun-

◦
hofer A band in the range 7595–7630
A in order to perform
small telluric corrections (Martin et al. 2014). The signal to
noise per pixel (S/N) of the reduced spectra in the Ca triplet
region is typical 30/8 at iP1 = 18.0/20.0.

For a cold stellar system like Dra II, it is particularly
important to assess the level of systematics on the mea-
sured velocity uncertainties. DEIMOS is known to yield a
small level of systematics that cannot be entirely explained
from properly tracking the sources of noise in the spectra.
These systematics are likely due to minute misalignments of
stars in the slits and can only be constrained through repeat
measurements of observations and/or a comparison with ref-
erence radial velocities. Ibata et al. (2011) conducted such
a comparison for high signal-to-noise DEIMOS spectra of
the NGC 2419 globular cluster, observed under very simi-
lar conditions (0.7′′ slits and ∼ 0.7′′ seeing) and processed

Dra II. Stars in our spectroscopic sample are colour-coded by their
heliocentric velocities whilst stars without spectroscopy are shown
in gray. The error bars represent the photometric uncertainties
for the stars with velocities. The 9 Dra II member stars appear
as dark blue. The blue line is an isochrone with the properties
assigned to the stellar system by Laevens et al. (2015, 13 Gyr,
[Fe/H] = −2.2, m−M = 16.9). The 4 member stars whose spectra
are displayed in Figure 4 are labeled. Right: Distribution of PS1

through our pipeline. The comparison was made with more
accurate HIRES observations of 7 stars and yielded an un-
certainty ﬂoor of 2.25 km s−1, which we add in quadrature
to the velocity uncertainties measured from the spectra.

After culling stars with low signal-to-noise (S/N < 3
per pixel) and velocity uncertainties higher than 15 km s−1,
we converge on a ﬁnal sample of 34 stars with good radial
velocity measurements. The properties of the 9 Dra II mem-
ber stars (see below) are listed in Table 1 and the properties
of ﬁeld stars are available online.

All velocities given in this letter are heliocentric radial

velocities, except when indicated otherwise.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Velocities

The location of the 34 sample stars in the Dra II CMD
and on the sky is displayed in Figure 1, colour-coded by
their heliocentric velocities. Already, one can note a sub-
sample of stars that track the CMD features of Dra II at
large negative velocities. This is conﬁrmed by the velocity
distribution of the whole sample, presented in the top panel
of Figure 2, that clearly exhibits a cold velocity peak near
vr ∼ −350 km s−1, within the expected range for a Milky
Way satellite. The 9 stars that compose the velocity peak
are those overlaid in dark blue in Figure 1. All 9 stars are
quite faint and belong to the stellar system’s MS, MSTO,
or low RGB. The isochrone of an old (13 Gyr) and metal-
poor ([Fe/H] = −2.2) stellar population at the distance of
Dra II (m − M ∼ 16.9; Laevens et al. 2015) is shown for
comparison.

Figure 2. Top: Heliocentric velocity distribution of the spec-
troscopic sample. The cold velocity peak at vr ∼ −350 km s−1
is produced by Dra II stars. The red line displays the best ﬁt to
the velocity distribution, convolved by the median velocity uncer-
tainty. Bottom: Probability distribution functions of the two ﬁt
parameters relevant to Dra II: the systemic velocity of the satel-
lite (left) and its velocity dispersion (right). The gray dashed lines
indicate the mode of the distributions.

Despite our selection of a large number of potential
(brighter) RGB stars, we did not uncover a single star with
iP1 < 18.5 in Dra II. On the other hand, the member stars
are, as expected, located towards the center of the system.
All but one member star lie in the ellipse delimiting the
region within 2rh.

We ﬁt the velocity distribution by a model composed of
the sum of 2 Gaussian functions representing the Dra II
signal and the MW foreground contamination. Follow-
ing the probabilistic framework presented in Martin et al.
(2014), which takes the individual velocity uncertainties
into account, yields the Dra II systemic velocity, hvri =
−1.8 km s−1 or hvr,gsri ≃ −180 km s−1, and its veloc-
−347.6+1.7
ity dispersion, σvr = 2.9±2.1 km s−1, with a 95% conﬁdence
limit of 8.4 km s−1. The probability distribution functions
are also shown in Figure 2 for these two parameters. The
set of parameters that maximises the likelihood function
is used to build the velocity model, which can be seen in
the top panel of the ﬁgure after convolution by the median
uncertainty. It compares very favourably with the velocity
distribution.

One may question the membership of the faintest star

in the sample, star 25, as it is rather red compared to the
isochrone shown in the left-hand panel of Figure 1. It hap-
pens to also be the outermost star with a high membership
probability, appearing as the only dark blue data point be-
yond the 2rh ellipse in the right-hand panel of Figure 1.
However, the faint magnitude of this star translates into
a large velocity uncertainty (5.7 km s−1) and, consequently,
keeping or removing it from the sample of members does not
impact the inference on the velocity properties of Dra II.

Although our contraints on the velocity dispersion are
weak, it is marginally resolved and close to values measured
for faint MW dwarf galaxies such as Segue 1 (Simon et al.
2011, 3.9 ± 0.8 km s−1). Using equation (1) of Wolf et al.
(2010), we can estimate the mass within the 3-dimensional
half-light radius, M1/2, via the half-light radius rh: M1/2 ≃
930rhσ2
vr M⊙. Randomly drawing values from the pdfs of
σvr from above and rh from Laevens et al. (2015) yields

−0.8, in
Solar units (Figure 3).

If Dra II were a stellar system in equilibrium and bina-
ries had no impact, one would expect a velocity dispersion of
order ∼ 0.3 km s−1. Therefore, even though we cannot rule
out that the large dynamical mass we measure could be a
statistical ﬂuctuation, we ﬁnd marginal evidence that Dra II
is hotter than would be implied solely by its baryonic con-
tent, hinting that it could be a dark-matter dominated dwarf

star that belongs to NGC 2419 ([Fe/H] = −2.1; Cohen et al.
2010), observed by Ibata et al. (2011) with the same instru-
mental set up. The brightest 4 Dra II member stars all show
weaker lines than the metal-poor NGC 2419. In fact, the Ca
triplet lines of stars 10, 4, and 5 are barely distinguishable
from the noise in the spectra, despite 10 < S/N < 15.

At this stage, a word of caution is necessary as the
NGC 2419 star is signiﬁcantly brighter (Mi = −0.6) than
the Dra II stars (Mi ≃ +2.0). As such,
it is expected
that the CaT lines of the Dra II stars should be less pro-
nounced for the same overall metallicity. In addition, the
Starkenburg et al. (2010) relation between the equivalent
widths of theses lines and the metallicity of their stars
has not been calibrated fainter than the horizontal branch
(Mi ≃ 0.9) so we are loath to blindly use this relation to
quote [Fe/H] values for these stars. However, Leaman et al.
(2013) have demonstrated in the case of the metal-poor glob-
ular cluster NGC 7078 that the Starkenburg et al. (2010)
relation is consistent with observations down to at least
∼ 2 magnitudes below the horizontal branch. Figure 1 of
the Leaman et al. paper shows that the CaT equivalent

(2.94 ± 0.19
A) is
driven mainly by the change of log g along the RGB and
that this star is consequently as metal-poor as NGC 2419.
It further implies that star 10, with a CaT equivalent width
of only 0.75 ± 0.21 is signiﬁcantly more metal-poor than
NGC 2419.

Figure 4. Comparison of the spectrum of a faint RGB star from
NGC 2419 (top), taken from the Ibata et al. (2011) sample, with
the spectra of the 4 Dra II member stars with the highest S/N
(bottom four panels). The spectra are smoothed with a 3-pixel
boxcar kernel. The wavelength coverage shown includes the Ca
triplet lines, clearly visible in the spectrum of the NGC 2419 star
and weaker in star 2 of the Dra II. These three strong lines are
almost buried in the noise of the other 3 spectra. Stars 2 and 10
display diﬀerent line depths, despite having similar colours and
magnitudes, implying a metallicity dispersion in the system.

galaxy. However, more velocities are required to strengthen
the velocity dispersion measurement and, in particular, as-
sess the impact of binary stars (McConnachie & Cˆot´e 2010;
Simon et al. 2011).

Unrelated to Dra II member stars, we note in passing
that the distribution of MW foreground contaminants tends
to favour negative velocities. In particular, 2 stars have ve-
locities below −220 km s−1, which is quite unexpected (a 3σ
deviation from expectations) and could point towards the
presence of halo stellar substructure along this line of sight.

3.2 Metallicities

The absence of bright RGB stars amongst the 9 Dra II
member stars limits our ability to accurately measure the
metallicity of the system. However, we note that the high
S/N member stars exhibit particularly weak Ca triplet lines,
which implies a very low [Fe/H] metallicity. In Figure 4, we
compare the spectra of Dra II member stars 2, 10, 4, and 5
(the 4 stars with the highest S/N ) with the spectrum of a

Furthermore, the stark diﬀerence between the spectra
of stars 2 and 10, which must have very similar stellar pa-
rameters as they are conﬁrmed Dra II member stars with
almost identical colours and magnitudes ((0.53,18.87) and
(0.55,18.98)), implies that these two member stars have sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent metallicities (a 4.5σ diﬀerence in the
equivalent width measurements). Therefore, we are left to
conclude that Dra II is not only a metal-poor system, but
also has a metallicity dispersion. Going further and esti-
mating tentative metallicity values for stars 2 and 10 via
equation (A.1) of Starkenburg et al. (2010) for I-band mag-
nitudes 2 yields [Fe/H] = −2.3 ± 0.1 and −3.5+0.5
−0.8, respec-
tively, in good agreement with the conclusions of the com-
parison with the NGC 2419 star.

Taking the dwarf galaxy luminosity–metallicity rela-
tion of Kirby et al. (2013b) at face value, one would ex-
pect [Fe/H] ∼ −2.6 for a system of Dra II’s overall lumi-
nosity, which is compatible with our ﬁndings. In addition,
only dwarf galaxies exhibit metallicity dispersions at these
magnitudes (Willman & Strader 2012). Therefore, the low
metallicity and the metallicity dispersion implied by our
analysis lead us to conclude that, independently of the kine-
matics, Dra II is likely a dwarf galaxy and not a globular
cluster.

1 In the following, CaT equivalent widths and their uncertainties
are estimated by ﬁtting Gaussian functions to the second and
third Ca lines. These are then summed into a global equivalent
width, as per Starkenburg et al. (2010).

Tonry et al. (2012) colour equations

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this letter, we performed a ﬁrst spectroscopic study of
the Dra II stellar system recently discovered in the PS1 3π
survey, which establishes some of its basic properties:

(i) A systemic velocity of hvr,gsri ≃ −180 km s−1 conﬁrms

it is indeed a satellite of the Milky Way.

(ii) The inferred velocity dispersion of Dra II is σvr =
2.9 ± 2.1 km s−1. Combined with the size of the system, it
implies a mass-to-light ratio within the 3-dimensional half-
light radius, log (cid:0)(M/L)1/2(cid:1) = 2.7+0.5
−0.8, that is hard to rec-
oncile with a baryonic system in equilibirum.

(iii) The Calcium triplet lines of Dra II member stars im-
ply that the system is more metal-poor than the NGC 2419
globular cluster, i.e. [Fe/H] < −2.1. The quasi-absence of
CaT lines in some of the member stars implies that the sys-
tematic metallicity of the system could be signiﬁcantly more
metal-poor than this, as expected from the dwarf galaxies’
luminosity–metallicity relation.

(iv) Two Dra II member stars with similar colours and
magnitudes have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent equivalent widths (a
4.5σ diﬀerence), which implies a metallicity dispersion in
Dra II. No [Fe/H] dispersion has ever been observed in low-
luminosity globular clusters, but is commonly observed in
dwarf galaxies.

None of the above measurements or arguments by it-
self can discriminate whether Dra II is a star cluster or
a dwarf galaxy. Taken together, however, these measure-
ments favour on balance the interpretation that this sys-
tem is amongst the faintest, most compact, and closest
−6 pc, LV = 103.1±0.3 L⊙, and
dwarf galaxies (rh = 19+8
DHelio ∼ 20 kpc) and a target of choice for both the study of
the faint end of galaxy formation and for searches of indirect
dark-matter detections.
