ABSTRACT

In order to investigate the properties of the prominent tidal debris feature extending to the northeast of
the compact group of galaxies Seyfert’s Sextet, we analyzed multi-band (U , B, V , V R, R, I, J, H and K ′)
photometric imaging data and obtained the following results: 1) The radial surface brightness distribution
of this tidal debris in Seyfert’s Sextet (TDSS) in each band appears to be well approximated by an
exponential proﬁle. 2) The observed B − V color of TDSS is similar to those of dwarf elliptical galaxies
in nearby clusters. 3) Comparing the spectral energy distribution (SED) of TDSS with theoretical
photometric evolution models and with the SED of the stars in the outer part of HCG 79b, we ﬁnd
that its SED is comparable to that of a ∼ 10 Gyr-old stellar population with solar metallicity, similar
to the stellar population in the outer part of HCG 79b. This suggests that TDSS consists of stars that
may have been liberated from HCG 79b by strong galaxy interactions, not a pre-existing dwarf galaxy
previously thought.

INTRODUCTION

Although dwarf galaxies are the most numerous extra-
galactic objects in the nearby Universe (e.g., Ferguson &
Binggeli 1994; Binggeli, Sandage & Tammann 1988; Ma-
teo 1998), it seems unclear how they are related in origin
to typical large (i.e., L∗) galaxies. Dwarf galaxies could
be formed through the same formation mechanism as that
of large galaxies; e.g., gravitational collapse of protogalac-
tic gas clouds (Dekel & Silk 1986; White & Frenk 1991;
Frenk et al. 1996; Kauﬀmann, Nusser & Steinmetz 1997).
However, it is known that dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs)
apparently belong to a diﬀerent class from normal large
ellipticals (Es) in the fundamental plane (e.g., Kormendy
1985), suggesting that the formation and/or evolution pro-
cesses of dwarfs may not always be the same as those of
larger ellipticals.

It has been argued from an observational view point
that dwarf galaxies may be formed by galaxy collisions
because there appears to be morphological evidence for
dwarf galaxies in the tidal tails of interacting galaxies
(Zwicky 1956; Schweizer 1978; Duc et al. 2000); i.e., gas-
rich dwarf irregular galaxies, can be made out of stellar
and gaseous material pulled out into intergalactic space
by tidal forces from the disks of colliding parent galaxies.
This possibility has been recently reinforced by a num-
ber of pieces of observational evidence (Schweizer 1982;
Bergvall & Johansson 1985; Schombert, Wallin & Struck-
Marcell 1990; Mirabel, Lutz & Maza 1991; Mirabel, Dot-
tori & Lutz 1992; Duc & Mirabel 1994, 1998; Duc et al.

2000; Yoshida, Taniguchi & Murayama 1994; Braine et
al. 2000; Weilbacher et al. 2000). Also, Hunsberger et
al. (1996; 1998) ﬁnd an excess of dwarf galaxies in com-
pact groups of galaxies apparently caused by interactions
among group members. Such formation of tidal dwarf
galaxies (TDGs) has also been demonstrated by numer-
ical simulations of merging/interacting galaxies (Barnes
& Hernquist 1992; Elmegreen, Kaufman & Thomasson
1993). Therefore, tidal formation seems to potentially
be an important formation mechanism for dwarf galaxies
(Okazaki & Taniguchi 2000 and references therein).

One famous tidal debris system extends to the north-
east of Seyfert’s Sextet (hereafter SS). SS is one of the
most famous, as well as densest, compact groups of galax-
ies (Seyfert 1948a, 1948b; see for a review, Raba¸ca 1996).
This group is also a Hickson compact group (hereafter
HCG) of galaxies, HCG 79 (Hickson 1982; 1993). Many
subsequent studies of SS have mentioned that the galaxies
in SS appear to show morphologically and dynamically pe-
culiar properties (Sulentic & Lorre 1983; Rubin, Hunter, &
Ford 1991; Bettoni & Fasano 1993; Mendes de Oliveira &
Hickson 1994; Bonfanti et al. 1999; Nishiura et al. 2000a).
Hickson himself regarded SS as a galaxy quartet (HCG
79a, 79b, 79c, and 79d). A ﬁfth component, HCG 79e,
was found to be a redshift-discordant galaxy that is be-
lieved to have no physical relation to SS (Hickson 1992).
A sixth object, or more precisely the north-eastern optical
fuzz, is now considered likely to be tidal debris associated
with the morphologically peculiar galaxy HCG 79b (Ru-

 
 
 
 
2

bin et al. 1991; Williams et al. 1991; Mendes de Oliveira
& Hickson 1994; V´ılchez & Iglesias-P´aramo 1998).

Current X-ray observations are not sensitive enough to
detect any X-ray emission that may originate from intra-
group gas that might be present in SS (Pildis, Bregman,
& Evrard 1995; Ponman et al. 1996). However, Sulen-
tic & Lorre (1983) and Nishiura et al. (2000b) detected
a faint optical envelope around SS that is plausibly com-
posed of stars tidally liberated from the galaxies in SS,
plus Williams, McMahon & van Gorkom (1991) found ex-
tended Hi emission. These observations suggest that SS is
a physically real compact group.

In this paper, we present results of our photometric
study of TDSS. Since this tidal debris system in SS (here-
after TDSS) is morphologically similar to other tidal de-
bris, such as Arp 105S and Arp 245N (Braine et al. 2000),
we will also compare the photometric properties of TDSS
with these two tidal debris. Throughout this paper we
adopt a distance to SS of 44 Mpc determined using the
mean recession velocity of HCG 79a, 79b, 79c, and 79d
referenced to the galactic standard of rest, VGSR = 4449
km s−1 (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), and a Hubble con-
stant, H0 = 100 km s−1 Mpc−1.

2. DATA

2.1. F 336W , F 439W , F 555W , and F 814W images

We obtained the archival HST/WFPC F 439W images
of SS (PI: Sulentic, J. W.). The total exposure time was
8100 seconds (Wu, Raba¸ca & Sulentic 1994; Raba¸ca 1997).
We used IRAF1 to reject cosmic-rays and to combine im-
ages.
We

the
HST/WFPC2 F 336W , F 439W , F 555W , and F 814W
images of SS (PI: Hunsberger, S. D.). The total exposure
times were 5200 seconds for F 336W , 5200 seconds for
F 439W , 2000 seconds for F 555W , and 2000 seconds for
F 814W .

also

We compute a Johnson B magnitude assuming that the
ﬁlter function of F 439W is the same as that of Johnson
B. We also do a Johnson V magnitude assuming that the
ﬁlter function of F 555W is the same as that of Johnson
V. According to Fig 11 in Holtzman et al (1995), Johnson
B ∼ B(F439W) - 0.1 for Johnson B - Johnson V of about
1. Johnson V ∼ V(F555W) - 0.05 for Johnson V - I of
about 1. Apparent Johnson B and Johnson V magnitudes
of TDSS may be 0.1 and 0.05 mag brighter, respectively.
But, our results using B-V and V-I colors do not signiﬁ-
cantly change.

2.2. V and R images

V - and R-band deep images of SS were obtained with
the 1K (1024 × 1024) CCD camera attached to the 105 cm
Schmidt telescope of the University of Tokyo at KISO Ob-
servatory, on 20 April, 1996 (R-band) and 21 April, 1996
(V -band). The camera provided a ≈ 12.′5 × 12.′5 ﬁeld of
view. The spatial resolution was 0.′′75 per pixel. The inte-
gration time for each exposure was set to 900 seconds for
V -band and 600 seconds for R-band. Four exposures for
the V -band and ﬁve exposures for the R-band were taken;
thus, the total integration time was 3,600 seconds in the V -

band image and 3,000 seconds in the R-band image. The
seeing was ≃4.′′6 for V -band and ≃5.′′2 for R-band dur-
ing the observations. Data reduction was performed in a
standard way using IRAF. Flux calibration for the R-band
images was made using the data of photometric standard
stars in the ﬁeld of PG 0942+029 (Landolt 1992). The V -
band observations were carried out under non-photometric
conditions. V -band image calibration was performed sim-
ply by using the measured magnitude of a star in the same
frame of SS, AC2000-738224 (Urban et al. 1997; Kislyuk
et al. 1999). The photometric errors were estimated to be
±0.27 mag for the V -band and ±0.04 mag for the R-band.

2.3. V R and I images

We used V R- and I-band images taken from our previ-
ous studies (Murayama et al. 2000; Nishiura et al. 2000b).
Since the V R-band is not a standard photometric band
(Jewitt, Luu & Chen 1996), we adopted an AB magnitude
scale for this bandpass.

2.4. J and H image

Near-infrared J- and H- images of SS were obtained
using the 105 cm Schmidt telescope at the KISO Obser-
vatory during the period between 1 July 2001 and 4 July
2001. The telescope was equipped with a large-format
near-infrared camera called the Kiso Observatory Near-
Infrared Camera (KONIC) (Itoh et al. 1995). KONIC
have 1040 × 1040 pixels providing a ≈ 18.′ × 18.′ ﬁeld of
view. The spatial resolution was 1..′06 arcsec per pixel.
We use the images further binned into 520 × 520 pixels,
hence a pixel scale is 2.′′12 per the 2×2 binned pixels.

The integration time for each exposure was set to 180
seconds. Twenty ﬁve exposures for J-band and thirty two
exposures for H-band were taken. Therefore the total in-
tegration times were 4500 seconds for J-band and 5760
seconds for H-band, respectively. The seeing was ∼ 2.′′5
during the observation.

Data reduction was performed in a standard way us-
ing IRAF. Flux calibration was made using the measured
magnitudes of stars by 2MASS in the same frame of SS,
1558526+203915, 1558546+205049, and 1559287+204805.
The photometric errors were estimated to be ±0.0x mag
for J-band and to be ±0.0x mag for H-band, respectively.
2.5. K ′ image
Near-infrared K′-band images of SS were obtained with
the 256 × 256 Infrared Camera attached to the f/13.5
Cassegrain focus of the University of Hawaii 0.6 m Plan-
etary Patrol telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory, on 9
May 1994. The camera provided a ≈ 8.′5 × 8.′5 ﬁeld of
view. The spatial resolution was 2.′0 arcsec per pixel. The
integration time for each exposure was set to 120 seconds.
Eight exposures were taken; thus, the total integration
time amounted to 960 seconds. The seeing was ∼ 2.′′4 dur-
ing the observation. Data reduction was performed in a
standard way using IRAF. Flux calibration was made us-
ing the data of the UKIRT bright standard stars HD84800,
HD105601, and HD136754, translated into K′-band values
(Wainscoat & Cowie 1992). The photometric errors were
estimated to be ±0.08 mag.

All the images of SS and TDSS are shown in Figure 1.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Surface Brightness Proﬁles of TDSS

Surface photometry of TDSS was carried out using the
Surface Photometry Interactive Reduction and Analysis
Library (SPIRAL: Hamabe & Ichikawa 1992). The sur-
face brightness proﬁle along the eastern major axis in each
passband is shown in Figure 2. Note that the western part
of TDSS may suﬀer from slight contamination by HCG
79b. To minimize light contamination from HCG 79b, we
show only the eastern-side proﬁle in Figure 2. In this pro-
cedure, the center of TDSS is deﬁned as the peak position
in the V R- and I-band images since our deepest exposures
are at V R- and I-band. The peak positions of the two im-
ages are the same: α = 15h57m03.s2, δ = +20◦54′26.′′4
(B1950.0).

the

F 336W ,

Unfortunately,

F 439W with
HST/WFPC2, J- and H-band surface brightness proﬁles
of TDSS are very low signal-to-noise ratio. For surface
brightness proﬁles in the other ﬁlter bands, there appears
to be a hump at r ≈ 9′′ in the F555W, V R−, I− band,
and F814W proﬁles (Figure 2). A broader hump is also
seen in the K ′-band proﬁle. Since we cannot ﬁnd any
foreground or background object at r ≈ 9′′, these humps
are considered to be real. On the other hand, such a hump
cannot be seen in the V- and R-band images. However,
since these images were obtained in poor seeing conditions,
the hump may simply be smeared out. The F 439W image
with HST/WFPC also appears to be too shallow to detect
the hump at r ≈ 9.′′. Sulentic & Lorre (1983), Rubin et
al. (1991), and Nishiura et al. (2000b) have reported that
there is a faint optical envelope around SS presumably
formed by strong galaxy collisions. Therefore, this hump
might represent the overlap between the faint end of TDSS
and the bright end of the faint optical envelope.

ﬁlled diamonds, and open diamonds indicate SB proﬁle in F 336W ,
F 555W , and F 814W , respectively. Open circles mean SB proﬁles in
F 439W with WFPC2. Crosses represent SB proﬁles in F 439W with
WFPC. (b) Filled circles, open circles, ﬁlled diamonds, and open

and ﬁlled squares indicate SB proﬁles in J-, H-, and K-band. All of
SB proﬁles are without smearing.

The radial surface brightness proﬁles in the high-quality
V R− and I-band images appear to be well represented by
an exponential-like proﬁle. Such proﬁles are often observed
in dwarf elliptical galaxies (Faber & Lin 1983; Ichikawa et
al. 1986a; 1986b), and also in the tidal dwarf galaxy Arp
245N (Duc et al. 2000).

3.2. Photometric Properties of TDSS

In order to investigate the stellar content of TDSS, we
now investigate its photometric properties. We ﬁrst smear
the F 336W -, F 439W -, F 555W -, V -, V R-, I-, F 814W -,
K ′-band images to match the seeing of our R-band image,
given that the R-band image has the largest seeing value
in our image set. Since a point spread function (PSF) of
KONIC is undesirably extended (Yanagisawa et al. 1996),
for the J− and H− images after the PSF deconvolution
were carried out with the Lucy-Richardsons method re-
alize in the STSDAS packages, we smear both images to
match the seeing of our R-band image. Then, using the
GAIA/SKYCAT2 package, we integrated the light within
an ellipse which encloses TDSS in each band; the semi-
major axis = 10.′′5, the eccentricity = 0.90, and the posi-
tion angle = 46◦. The results are shown in Table 1. Un-
fortunately, in F336W image large noise overlapped with
TDSS, we obtained only upper limit of F336W ﬂux of
TDSS.

We compare the color-magnitude relation found for
TDSS with those of other similar objects by using a B − V
versus MB diagram. We obtain an averaged apparent mag-

nitude of 17.13 ± 0.01 mag (Johnson B) for TDSS after
correcting for galactic extinction (de Vaucouleurs et al.
1991; Cardelli et al. 1989; Schlegel et al. 1998). We also
obtained apparent Johnson V magnitudes of 16.17 ± 0.27
(observed with 1K-CCD camera) and of 16.40 ± 0.003 mag
(observed with WFPC2). Thus, we obtained a Johnson
B − V colors for TDSS of 0.73±0.01 mag and 0.97±0.27
mag and an absolute Johnson B magnitude of −16.14 mag.

Fig. 3.— Absolute B-magnitude versus B − V color diagram.
Filled circle and ﬁlled triangle indicate TDSS. Open circle and open
square indicate the tidal dwarf galaxies Arp 105S and Arp 245N,
respectively. Filled squares, open diamonds, ﬁlled diamonds, and
crosses represent dwarf elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster, For-
nax cluster, Centaurus cluster, and NGC 5044 group, respectively.
Solid lines and dotted lines represent the locus of chemo-photometric
evolution models taken from Arimoto & Yoshii (1987): the galaxy
mass of MG/109M⊙ =1, 4, 10, 100, and 1000, and the age t =0.1,
1, 5, 10, and 15 Gyr.

In Figure 3, we plot the data points for TDSS to-
gether with those of two tidal dwarf galaxies, Arp 105S
(VGSR = 8518 km s−1: de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) and
Arp 245N (VGSR = 2175 km s−1, which is the average value
of the VGSR of NGC 2992 and NGC 2993: de Vaucouleurs
et al. 1991; Braine et al. 2000), and dwarf ellipticals in
the Virgo cluster (Bothun et al. 1989), the Fornax cluster
(Bothun et al. 1989), the Centaurus cluster (Bothun et
al. 1989), and the NGC 5044 group (Cellone 1999). We
also show theoretical loci of chemo-photometric evolution
models taken from Arimoto & Yoshii (1987). The B − V
and MB properties of TDSS are diﬀerent from those of
Arp 105S (MB = −16.28, B − V = 0.3) and Arp 245N
(MB = −16.63, B − V = 0.55) (Braine et al. 2000). In
Figure 3 TDSS is located near the bright end of the loci
of dwarf ellipticals in nearby clusters. Braine et al. (2000)
suggested that Arp 105S and Arp 245N have experienced
recent (< 1 Gyr) bursts of star formation. However, the
data shown in Figure 3 suggests that a recent (< 1 Gyr)
star formation burst has not occurred in TDSS.

Schombert et al. (1990) showed averaged the B-V color
of tidal features (tails, bridges, plumes, and envelopes) of
0.64±0.24. The B-V color of TDSS is similar to or redder
than those of these tidal features.

Fig. 4.— The spectral energy distribution of TDSS and simple
stellar population models. Filled circles indicate the data for TDSS.
Solid, dotted, and dashed lines indicate the simple stellar population
model - (a) with solar metallicity at 1, 3, and 10 Gyr, and (b) the
same model at 10 Gyr with 0.2 (dashed line), 0.4 (dotted line), and
1.0 (solid line) solar metallicity, respectively.

Next, we investigate the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of TDSS. The observed SED is shown in Figure
4a. We also show model SEDs generated by GISSEL96
(Bruzual & Charlot 1993; Charlot et al. 1996). Here we
adopt the simple stellar population model with a Salpeter
(1955) initial mass function (IMF), solar metallicity, and
upper and lower mass cutoﬀs of 125 M⊙ and 0.1 M⊙, re-
spectively. In Figure 4a, we show model SEDs with ages
of 1 Gyr, 3 Gyr, and 10 Gyr. All the models have been
scaled to the observed K ′ ﬂux of TDSS for relative com-
parison to the observed SED. Furthermore we also show
the results of a comparison of the 10 Gyr model SEDs with
0.2, 0.4, 1.0 solar metallicity to the observed SED in Fig-
ure 4b. These comparisons suggest that the observed SED
is consistent with model SEDs of nearly solar metallicity
with ages between 3 Gyr and 10 Gyr.

4. DISCUSSION

The main result from our multi-band photometric stud-
ies of the tidal debris in SS is that TDSS appears to consist
of an old stellar population with > 0.4 solar metallicity
(Figure 4a, 4b). Duc & Mirabel (1999) indicate that tidal
dwarf galaxies have an average metallicity of one third of
solar, which is independent of their absolute blue magni-
tude (Duc et al. 2000). The metallicity of TDSS thus
appears to be higher with compared to tidal dwarf galax-
ies.

Fig. 5.— The spectral energy distribution of the outer part of
HCG 79b and simple stellar population models. Filled circles indi-
cate the data of HCG 79b. Solid, dotted, and dashed lines indicate
the simple stellar population model with a solar metallicity at t =1,
3, and 10 Gyr, respectively.

The spatial conﬁguration of TDSS and the member
galaxies in SS and the spatial distribution of Hi emission
suggest that TDSS was liberated from HCG 79b during the
strong interaction of HCG 79b with HCG 79d (Williams et
al. 1991; Mendes de Oliveira & Hickson 1994). Therefore,
it seems reasonable to consider that TDSS mainly con-
sists of stars liberated from the outer region of HCG 79b.
This means that the old stellar population with nearly so-
lar metallicity in TDSS should be identical to that of the
outer region of HCG 79b. In order to investigate the stellar
population of the outer region of HCG 79b, we carried out
aperture photometry of the outer region of HCG 79b by
integrating the light within an annular ellipse with semi-
major axes between 5.′′2 and 12.′′0. The lower cutoﬀ radius
is determined to avoid the inner star forming regions of
HCG 79b (V´ılchez & Iglesias-P´aramo 1998; Shimada et
al. 2000). The ellipse eccentricity and position angle are
set to be 0.85 and 8◦, respectively. The center coordinate
of the annular ellipse is α = 15h57m00.s8, δ = +20◦54′15.′′4
(B1950.0) (Hickson 1993). In four WFPC2 images, since
lines of insensitive pixels run through the HCG79b, we
cannot obtain the four ﬂuxes (F336W, F439W, F555W,
F814W) of TDSS with WFPC2. The resultant SED is
shown in Figure 5 (see also Table 2). The same model
SEDs used in Figure 4a are also shown in Figure 5. Al-
though the I-band ﬂux is a bit weaker than the model one,
the overall SED is well described by a model SED with an
age of 10 Gyr and solar metallicity. ¿From these SED
comparisons, it does seem likely that TDSS was liberated
from HCG 79b by strong interaction with HCG 79d. This
would then be the reason why the abundance of TDSS is
richer that those of tidal dwarf galaxies. Schombert et al.
(1990) has also shown that the colors of many tidal fea-
tures are similar to the outer parts of the parent galaxies
further strengthening the “stripping origin” hypothesis.

Comparing the spatial distribution of Hi emission with
the numerical simulation by Toomre & Toomre (1972),
Williams et al (1991) suggested that the Hi countertail
and the optical counterarm from HCG 79b could have
been generated ≈ 0.5 Gyr ago after the close encounter
between HCG 79b and HCG 79d. Since it is known that
tidal arms are promptly liberated from interacting galax-
ies, it seems likely that a secondary star formation event
could have been induced during the early phase of tidal
liberation such as appears to be the case in tidal dwarf
galaxies (Figure 3).

Fig. 6.— Optical V R + I-band image and the intensity map of
the Hi emission taken from Williams et al. (1991). Hi contours are
drawn at levels 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85,
0.95, 1.05, and 1.15 Jy km s−1 per beam.

Williams et al. (1991) detected Hi emission at a level
of 1.4 × 1020 H cm−2 at the eastern end of TDSS. In Fig-
ure 6, we show our optical V R + I image together with
the Hi intensity map taken from Williams et al. (1991).
The Hi emission appears associated with TDSS and dis-
tributed in an ellipse whose semi-major and semi-minor
axes are 15.′′0 and 10.′′0, respectively. If we assume that
the Hi column density within this ellipse is constant at
a value of 1.4 × 1020 H cm−2, we roughly estimate that
the Hi gas mass associated with TDSS is 2 × 107M⊙.
Thus, we obtain a ratio of the Hi gas mass to optical
B−band luminosity of 3.2 × 10−2M⊙/L⊙ for TDSS. This
value is much smaller than those of Arp 105S (LB =
4.9 × 108L⊙, MHi = 4 × 108M⊙, MHi/LB = 0.8M⊙/L⊙)
and Arp 245N (LB = 6.1 × 108L⊙, MHi = 6 × 108M⊙,
MHi/LB = 1.0M⊙/L⊙). Furthermore, V´ılchez & Iglesias-
P´aramo (1998) detect no Hα emission in TDSS. This sug-
gests the poverty of very massive stars in TDSS. These
observations suggest that only a small amount of gas was
involved in the formation of TDSS.

Bettoni & Fasano (1993) and Bonfanti et al.

(1999)
mentioned another possibility; i.e., TDSS (called “HCG
79b1” in their papers) is a pre-existing galaxy falling into
SS that is being destroyed by galaxy-galaxy interaction.
Since the photometric properties of TDSS are similar to
those of dEs (i.e., B-V colors and exponential surface
brightness proﬁles), their idea may remain as a possible
one. However, from the metallicity of TDSS, as deter-
mined from the SED, we suggest that TDSS is a tidally-
induced object consisting primarily of stars liberated from
HCG 79b. Further investigation of the mass-to-luminosity
ratio and/or a more detailed investigation of the metallic-
ity would be useful to conﬁrm this hypothesis. It also re-
quires numerical simulations to make sure whether tidally
object being made by galaxy interactions without sec-
ondary star formation.

5. CONCLUSIONS

From multi-band photometry of the prominent tidal de-
bris feature to the northeast of Seyfert’s Sextet we have
obtained the following results:

1. The surface brightness proﬁle of this tidal debris in
Seyfert’s Sextet (TDSS) in each band shows an ap-
proximately exponential proﬁle.

2. The observed B − V color of TDSS is redder than
those of tidal dwarf galaxies, e.g., Arp 105S and Arp
245N (Braine et al. 2000).

3. Comparing the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
TDSS with theoretical photometric evolution mod-
els, we ﬁnd that its SED is comparable to that of
a stellar population with age ∼ 10 Gyr and with
higher metallicity than the average values found in
tidal dwarf galaxies.

4. Comparing SEDs, we ﬁnd that the SED of TDSS is
similar to that of the stars in the outer part of HCG
79b.

5. TDSS seems to consist primarily of stars liberated

from HCG 79b by strong galaxy interaction.

We conclude that TDSS is simply a passive tidal fea-
ture like many others in interacting galaxy systems. We
also conclude that there is no indication that TDSS will
evolve into a star-forming tidal dwarf galaxy similar to
those previously studied. This, however, indicates that
another type of forming dwarf galaxy without secondary
star formation through the galaxy interaction.
