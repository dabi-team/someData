ABSTRACT

We present a chemodynamical analysis of the Leo V dwarf galaxy, based on Keck
II DEIMOS spectra of 8 member stars. We ﬁnd a systemic velocity for the system
of (cid:104)vr(cid:105) = 170.9+2.1
−1.9 km s−1, and barely resolve a velocity dispersion for the system,
with σvr = 2.3+3.2
−1.6 km s−1, consistent with previous studies of Leo V. The poorly
resolved dispersion means we are unable to adequately constrain the dark matter
content of Leo V. We ﬁnd an average metallicity for the dwarf of [Fe/H]= −2.48±0.21,
and measure a signiﬁcant spread in the iron abundance of its member stars, with
−3.1 ≤[Fe/H]≤ −1.9 dex, which cleanly identiﬁes Leo V as a dwarf galaxy that has
been able to self-enrich its stellar population through extended star formation. Owing
to the tentative photometric evidence for tidal substructure around Leo V, we also
investigate whether there is any evidence for tidal stripping or shocking of the system
within its dynamics. We measure a signiﬁcant velocity gradient across the system, of
dχ = −4.1+2.8
dv
−45.6 km s−1 kpc−1), which points
almost directly toward the Galactic centre. We argue that Leo V is likely a dwarf on
the brink of dissolution, having just barely survived a past encounter with the centre
of the Milky Way.

1 INTRODUCTION

In a ΛCDM Universe, collisionless dark matter simulations
predict that galaxies like the Milky Way should host ∼ 300
satellite galaxies (e.g., Klypin et al. 1999; Moore et al.
1999). Presently, only ∼ 40 satellites have been detected
around our Galaxy, resulting in a large discrepancy. Much
of this discrepancy may be due to incomplete survey cover-
age (Tollerud et al. 2008; Hargis et al. 2014), and is further
dependent on other factors not necessarily constrained by
dark matter simulations. These include the lowest mass at
which dark matter subhalos can form stars; the precise mass
of the Milky Way – still not accurately known (Xue et al.
2008; Li & White 2008; Watkins et al. 2010; Bovy et al.

2012; Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2013; Bhattacharjee et al. 2014;
Pe˜narrubia et al. 2014); and the detailed mass proﬁles of the
subhalos themselves.

This last issue is of particular interest, as the shape of
the central potentials of these smallest of galaxies has an
impact on their survivability. Collisionless dark matter sim-
ulations predict that their proﬁle should be steeply cusped
(Navarro et al. 1997), making them resilient to tidal dis-
ruption by the Milky Way (Pe˜narrubia et al. 2008). How-
ever, observations of several dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the
Milky Way suggest they may host ﬂatter, less dense cores
in their centres (Battaglia et al. 2008b; Walker & Pe˜narru-
bia 2011; Amorisco & Evans 2012; Cole et al. 2012)1, mak-

ing them more susceptible to destruction through tidal in-
teractions (Pe˜narrubia et al. 2010). Recent hydrodynamical
simulations of dwarf galaxies by, e.g., Read et al. (2016)
demonstrate that bright dwarf galaxies (M∗ > 6 × 105M(cid:12))
are able to lower their central dark matter densities, and
even transform their central cusps into cores, so long as they
have had a prolonged star formation history (of order a few
Gyrs to a Hubble time). If this is the case, we should ex-
pect to ﬁnd numerous satellites that are tidally disturbed
or disrupting at the present epoch, as cored systems are
more susceptible to tidal disruption than cusped ones. This
would imply that there are fewer surviving dwarf galaxies
around the Milky Way than predicted by cosmological sim-
ulations where baryons are not modelled. Constraining both
the number and nature of the present day satellite popula-
tion can therefore give us an insight into the mass proﬁles
of these systems.

Current deep, wide-ﬁeld sky surveys, such as the Dark
Energy Survey (DES), PanSTARRS 1 (PS1), and VST AT-
LAS, are making signiﬁcant headway in constraining the
number of Milky Way satellites. Over the past year, these
eﬀorts have doubled the number of known Galactic satel-
lites (e.g., Bechtol et al. 2015; Koposov et al. 2015; Drlica-
Wagner et al. 2015; Laevens et al. 2014, 2015a,b; Torrealba
et al. 2016a,b), alongside targeted deep imaging campaigns
using the Dark Energy Camera (e.g., Martin et al. 2015;
Kim & Jerjen 2015). These new discoveries are typically very
faint, with luminosities of a few hundred to a few hundred
thousand L(cid:12), which is why they have remained ‘missing’

until recently (see Fig. 1). To ascertain their nature, and
whether they are truly dwarf galaxies, spectroscopic follow-
up is required. As set out in Willman & Strader (2012),
for a stellar association to be considered a dwarf galaxy, it
must have a high mass-to-light ratio, indicative of an under-
lying dark halo. Additionally, all concretely classiﬁed dwarf
galaxies to date possess a spread in iron abundance amongst
their stellar population, which is not seen in star clusters.
Such signatures require the measurement of the kinematics
and chemistries of individual stars in these systems via their
spectra.

facilities

Thus far, only a handful of these new systems have
been followed up spectroscopically (Walker et al. 2015;
Simon et al. 2015; Kirby et al. 2015a,b; Martin et al.
2016a,b; Torrealba et al. 2016a; Voggel et al. 2016), and
owing to the lack of stars bright enough to be targeted
in these faint
spectroscopically with current
systems, a number of these studies remain inconclusive. For
example, a spectroscopic study of Draco II (MV = −2.9)
using Keck II DEIMOS by Martin et al. (2016a) was
unable to conﬁrm whether this satellite is a galaxy or a
cluster from the chemodynamics of 9 member stars, as it
is incredibly challenging to resolve the very low velocity
dispersions expected for such faint systems using current
instrumentation. Even when the dynamical analyses of these
low luminosity systems yield high velocity dispersions, and
hence high mass-to-light ratios ([M/L]half > 10M(cid:12)/L(cid:12)),
such as in Triangulum II (Kirby et al. 2015b; Martin et al.
2016b), it remains unclear whether the system is hugely
dark matter dominated (as suggested in Kirby et al. 2015b
from 6 member stars), or a galaxy that is out of dynamical
equilibrium, possibly as a result of tidal interaction with
the Milky Way (Martin et al. 2016b from 13 member stars).

The problem of concretely determining the nature of
faint satellites is not unique to these most recent surveys.
The ﬁrst ultra faint dwarf galaxies (i.e., dwarf galaxies with
MV > −7) detected in SDSS have been similarly tricky.
For example, follow-up spectroscopy of Willman 1, a faint
(MV = −2.5), small (rhalf = 25 pc) satellite (Willman et al.
2005) found that while the system shows an iron abundance
spread among its red giant branch stars, its kinematics do
not conﬁrm that it is dark matter dominated. Instead, they
show that Willman 1 is out of dynamical equilibrium (Will-
man et al. 2011), similar to Triangulum II. At a present day
distance from the Galactic centre of ∼ 35 kpc, it is not in-
conceivable that Willman 1 is on an orbit that has led to its
near total disruption.

The nature of a number of other SDSS ultra-faints has
also been questioned, based on imaging and spectroscopy.
Searching for evidence of tidal interactions through imag-
ing alone can be incredibly challenging around these al-
ready low surface brightness objects (Martin et al. 2008),
however several systems do show evidence for distortions in
their outskirts. Examples include Canes Venatici I, Canes
Venatici II, Ursa Major II, Hercules and Leo V (Martin
et al. 2008; Sand et al. 2009; Mu˜noz et al. 2010; Sand et al.
2012; Roderick et al. 2015). Many of the ultra-faints deviate
from the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which could also
suggest tidal stripping has played a role in shaping these
galaxies (McGaugh & Wolf 2010). Possibly the strongest

with our Galaxy is the Hercules dwarf spheroidal (Her). In
addition to its elongated body (Coleman et al. 2007), and
surrounding debris, kinematic analyses of its member stars
show evidence of a strong velocity gradient along its major

axis ( dv
& Jin (2010) subsequently demonstrated that this gradient
was indicative of Her being pulled apart into a tidal stream.
Further modelling work by K¨upper et al. (2016), who at-
tempt to match both the kinematics and the extended de-
bris ﬁeld of Her seen in imaging from Roderick et al. (2015),
ﬁnd that tidal shocking from a close passage with the Milky
Way centre is a very credible explanation of Her’s present
day properties.

Here, we investigate another of these diﬃcult-to-classify
objects: Leo V. Leo V was ﬁrst reported in Belokurov et al.
(2008) as a stellar overdensity in SDSS imaging. Leo V is
a faint (MV = −4.3), small (rhalf = 70.9 pc) object, lo-
cated 180 kpc from us, presumably near the apocentre of
its orbit (Belokurov et al. 2008; Sand et al. 2012). Its po-
sition on the sky suggests it may be a companion to the
neighbouring Leo IV dSph, which is located at a similar
distance, only 3 deg from Leo V. The two objects have
similar systemic velocities of (cid:104)vr(cid:105) ∼ 173 km s−1 for Leo V
(Belokurov et al. 2008) and (cid:104)vr(cid:105) ∼ 130 km s−1 for Leo IV
(Simon & Geha 2007). Based on deep imaging from Sand
et al. (2012), Leo V shows signs of stream-like over-densities
at large radii, as well as an extended component of blue
horizontal branch (BHB) stars, while Leo IV appears to
show no signs of tidal debris (Sand et al. 2010). Spectro-
scopic observations using the Hectochelle spectrograph on
the MMT (Walker et al. 2009a) measured a velocity disper-
sion of σvr = 2.4+2.4
−1.4 km s−1 from 5 central member stars.
As they were unable to fully resolve the velocity dispersion,
they could not rule out that Leo V is a diﬀuse star cluster.
Similarly, as they could not measure individual abundances
for their member stars, they could not determine whether
Leo V possessed a spread in iron. In summary, while the
data favour a dwarf galaxy, this has not been conﬁrmed.

In this work, we present new kinematics for stars within
Leo V. Our data are taken using the Deep Extragalactic
Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the 10-
m Keck II telescope. Our spectra have high enough signal-
to-noise that we measure individual stellar metallicities, al-
lowing us to determine whether Leo V has self-enriched its
stellar population through an extended star formation his-
tory. The layout of this paper is as follows: we present our
observations in § 2, and present our analysis of the kinemat-
ics and metallicities of Leo V stars in § 3. We discuss the
signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings in § 4, and conclude in § 5.

2 OBSERVATIONS

We utilised the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II tele-
scope (Faber et al. 2003) to observe Leo V on 16th May 2015.
Stars were selected for observations from a combination of
SDSS and Magellan imaging (Sand et al. 2012). Stars with
colours consistent with lying on the Leo V red giant branch
(RGB) or horizontal branch (HB) were prioritised for ob-
servation. We employed the medium resolution 1200 l/mm
grating (R ∼ 6000), the OG550 ﬁlter and a central wave-

length of 7800˚A. This allowed us to adequately resolve the
Ca II lines, located at ∼ 8500˚A. These strong absorption fea-
tures allow for precision measurements of both the velocities
and iron abundances of Leo V’s stellar population.

We reduced our raw data following the procedure of
Tollerud et al. (2012, 2013). Brieﬂy, we use the spec2d
pipeline to convert our raw images to 1D spectra (Davis
et al. 2003; Cooper et al. 2012; Newman et al. 2013). We
then measure line-of-sight velocities for our stars (vr,i) by
cross-correlating their 1D spectra with the spectra of known
radial velocity standard stars. We determine uncertainties
(δvr,i) on these measurements using a Monte-Carlo process,
wherein we re-simulate each spectrum with added noise,
representative the per-pixel variance. We then re-determine
the velocity for this spectrum, and repeat the process 1000
times. The ﬁnal velocity and uncertainty are then set to be
the mean and variance from these 1000 resimulations (Simon
& Geha 2007). Additionally, through the repeat measure-
ments of stars from DEIMOS spectra over the past decade,
we know there is a systematic ﬂoor in the velocity uncertain-
ties from our observational set-up, equivalent to 2.2 km s−1
(Simon & Geha 2007; Kalirai et al. 2010; Tollerud et al.
2012). We add this uncertainty in quadrature to our mea-
sured uncertainty. Finally, as DEIMOS is a slit spectrograph,
we also need to correct for any small shifts in velocity that
may occur from mis-centering of stars within the slits them-
selves. We do this using strong telluric lines, as outlined in
Tollerud et al. (2012).

Of the 63 targets observed, 35 were successfully reduced,
with 28 having reliable velocities (i.e. where at least 2 lines
of the Ca II triplet could clearly be seen). Their photomet-
ric and spectroscopic properties are presented in table 1.
The spectra within this sample have a median velocity un-
certainty of δvr,i ∼ 3 km s−1 and S/N ∼ 3 - 45 per pixel
(median S/N = 15 per pixel).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Kinematic properties of Leo V

In Figure 2, we present the kinematics of all stars for which
reliable velocities were measured. The top panel shows a
velocity histogram, with a signiﬁcant peak of 9 stars at
v ∼ 170 km s−1. This velocity is consistent with the pre-
vious measurement of systemic velocity for Leo V from Be-
lokurov et al. (2008) and Walker et al. (2009a) of (cid:104)vr(cid:105) =
173.3 km s−1. The majority of stars with Leo V-like veloci-
ties sit within ∼ 2×rhalf , as demonstrated in the lower panel
of Figure 2, where we display the velocity of stars as a func-
tion of their distance from the centre of Leo V. The dashed
horizontal lines represent 1, 2, 3 and 4 × rhalf (rhalf = 1.14(cid:48),
Sand et al. 2012), and the most-probable Leo V members
are highlighted as red stars.

There are 2 stars within the velocity window of Leo V
which we do not classify as likely members. The ﬁrst is star
18, located ∼ 3(cid:48) (∼ 2.5 rhalf ) from the centre of the system.
This star is a BHB candidate member based on its photome-
try, but its velocity is very poorly constrained, owing to low
S/N (discussed in the appendix, with spectrum shown in
ﬁg. A1). As such, we do not include it in our analysis below,
but highlight it as a plausible member of the system, re-
quiring further follow-up to conﬁrm. The star denoted with

a grey circle, ∼ 4.5(cid:48) from the centre of Leo V (star 20),
while kinematically consistent with Leo V, is unlikely to be
a member of the system as its photometric properties are
inconsistent with belonging to the RGB or HB of Leo V2.
A comparison with the Besan¸con model (Robin et al. 2003)
suggests that this foreground interloper is not unexpected,
as 1-2 Milky Way stars with Leo V-like velocities are pre-
dicted by the model within our DEIMOS ﬁeld-of-view.

The remaining 8 stars are kinematically consistent with
Leo V, and also possess colours consistent with Leo V mem-
bership. This is shown in Figure 3, where we present the
colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) for Leo V, constructed
from Magellan/SDSS imaging. 3 of these stars overlap with
members from the Walker et al. (2009a) analysis, which
we discuss further in § 4.1. The black points represent all
stars within 2 × rhalf of Leo V, and those subsequently ob-
served with DEIMOS are colour coded by their velocities.
Our Leo V members are highlighted with open stars, and
are consistent with being members of the RGB or HB pop-
ulation of Leo V.

To ascertain the basic kinematic properties of Leo V,
we use an MCMC implementation, similar to that of Martin
et al. 2014, to model the system in two ways. Firstly, we

2 Star 20 has a velocity consistent with Leo V, but is blue-ward
of the tip of the RGB, with g ∼ 19.5 and g − r ∼ 0.4. Its position
in the CMD could imply that it is a young blue loop star, with
an age of 300-1000 Myr. However, it has reasonably well deﬁned
Ca II lines, and prominent Na I lines (see Fig. A2), consistent
with the spectrum of a foreground dwarf star.

assume Leo V is a typical, dispersion supported dSph galaxy,
with little-to-no rotation. We then model the kinematics of
our full sample as a two component system, deﬁned by a
Milky Way population (our only source of contamination),
and Leo V itself. We construct a probability distribution
function for these two populations, which assumes both are
Gaussians. This then gives the likelihood, Li of a given data
point with velocity vr,i and uncertainty δvr,i as:

ity dispersion of the Milky Way within our ﬁeld. We use
ﬂat priors for each of our parameters, constraining them to
be within plausible physical ranges. For the velocity dis-

dimensional PDFs for our two parameters of interest: the
systemic velocity of Leo V, (cid:104)vr(cid:105), and its velocity disper-
sion, σvr, obtained by marginalising over all other (nui-
sance) properties. This yields measurements of (cid:104)vr(cid:105) =
172.1+2.3
−2.3 km s−1. The uncertain-
ties are the 68th-percentile conﬁdence bound, i.e., a ±1σ
uncertainty. These values are summarised in table 2, and
are entirely consistent with those of Belokurov et al. (2008)
and Walker et al. (2009a) of (cid:104)vr(cid:105) = 173.3 ± 3.1 km s−1 and
σvr = 2.4+2.4
−1.4 km s−1, measured from 5 stars observed with
MMT/Hectochelle.

Assuming Leo V is a dispersion supported system, we
can calculate its mass within the half-light radius (Mhalf )
using the relation of Walker et al. (2009b), where:

Mhalf = 580 rhalf σ2

−2.3 km s−1, we measure Mhalf = 6.5+7.8

derived σvr = 4.0+3.3
−5.9 ×
105M(cid:12). From this, we can infer the mass-to-light ratio
within the half-light radius of [M/L]half ∼ 264+326
−264M(cid:12)/L(cid:12),
which implies Leo V is a dark matter dominated system,
however owing to the small measured velocity dispersion,
and comparably large uncertainties, this value is consistent
with zero within 1σ.

Our second model for Leo V does not assume the sys-
tem is purely dispersion supported. While a low mass system
such as Leo V is not expected to have strong rotational sup-
port, previous imaging and spectroscopic studies of the sys-
tem have indicated that it may be in the process of disrupt-
ing, or residing in an extended stellar stream. In both the

scope (Sand et al. 2012), Leo V shows a centrally concen-
trated distribution of RGB stars, with rhalf = 1.1(cid:48). However,
it potentially possesses a more extended BHB population,
with rhalf = 2.9(cid:48) (Sand et al. 2012). At least 2 of these far-
ﬂung BHB stars have velocities consistent with belonging to
Leo V (located at 13(cid:48), or ∼ 10 × rhalf from the centre of
Leo V, Walker et al. 2009a). This study concluded that, if

Leo V were a typical stellar system that had not undergone
signiﬁcant tidal stripping, the probability of having observed
two such far ﬂung members was ∼ 10−4.

These unusual ﬁndings could imply that Leo V is cur-
rently disrupting, either from an interaction with the Milky
Way, or from an interaction with Leo IV, a nearby dwarf
galaxy with a similar galactocentric distance and systemic
velocity. To see if there is any kinematic evidence for such
a tidal disturbance, we modify equation 1 to include a
velocity gradient ( dv
dχ ), acting along some axis, θ, follow-
ing the method of Martin & Jin (2010). This modiﬁes

distance of the star from the centre of Leo V in X and Y

Yi = δi−δ0, and that can be converted to an angular distance
along an axis with a PA of θ such that yi = Xi sin(θ) +

East).

We once again use emcee to explore this parameter
space. For this method, we choose to exclude the outlier
star (star 20) which has a velocity consistent with Leo V,
but is not associated based on its photometry, as it will have
an eﬀect on any measured gradient in the system.3

marginalised over all other (nuisance) parameters. These
are the systemic velocity and dispersion, as before, plus
the inferred velocity gradient, and the position angle along
which this is found to be a maximum. For this routine,
we ﬁnd (cid:104)vr(cid:105) = 170.9+2.0

of σvr = 2.3+3.2

slightly lower than, the values we measured using a Gaussian
distribution for the kinematics of Leo V. However, it should
be noted that the dispersion is not properly resolved, and
the median should be viewed as an upper limit for σvr in this
case. Our MCMC analysis does ﬁnd evidence for a fairly siz-

kpc. Such a large velocity gradient is not expected in a
galaxy as faint as Leo V, as it shouldn’t possess signiﬁcant
rotation.

Given the small sample size here (only 8 stars), it is
important to assess the signiﬁcance of this gradient. We do
this using two tests. The ﬁrst follows the method of Walker
et al. (2008) and Ad´en et al. (2009). Brieﬂy, we perform 1000
Monte Carlo realisations of our data, where the velocity-
uncertainty pairs for each member star are randomly reas-
signed with spatial information from the same dataset. This
maintains the spatial and velocity distribution of our sam-
ple, while eﬀectively scrambling any relationship between
velocity and position. We then perform our MCMC analysis
for each of the 1000 realisations, and deﬁne the signiﬁcance

of our measured gradient to be the fraction of realisations
which fail to reproduce a velocity gradient as strong as the
one we measure. This results in a signiﬁcance of 99.6%. 4
In our second test, we generate a sample of 10,000 ‘stars’,
that have a simple Gaussian velocity distribution, centered
on 172 km s−1 and with a dispersion of 4 km s−1 (the proper-
ties we deduce for Leo V from our MCMC analysis where we
assume no gradient is present). We convolve these velocities
with uncertainties typical of our data, and randomly sample
8 stars from this distribution. For their positional distribu-
tion, we retain the same radial distribution as our dataset
(i.e. the distance of the stars from the centre of Leo V), as
the spatial selection function for our DEIMOS observations
is diﬃcult to reproduce,. We then randomize their angular
distribution and run these 8 simulated stars through our
emcee analysis. We repeat this 1000 times, and ﬁnd we can
reproduce a gradient as steep as that which we observe in
our real data only 1.1% of the time, giving a signiﬁcance of
98.9%.

We summarise our velocity gradient ﬁndings in table 2,
and show the velocity vs. projected distance along the gradi-
ent direction, yi, for the likely Leo V member stars in Fig. 6.
Given the strong velocity gradient, it is not clear that
our previous calculations for the mass, and mass-to-light ra-
tio of Leo V are reliable. The mass estimator of Walker et al.
(2009b) assumes that the kinematics of the system in ques-
tion are dominated by the velocity dispersion. It also as-
sumes the system is in dynamical equilibrium, which is no
longer clear. In either case, it is likely that our ﬁrst method
would over-estimate both Mhalf and [M/L]half . If we instead
substituted our smaller velocity dispersion from this second
analysis, we ﬁnd the mass and mass-to-light ratio of Leo V
drop by a factor of ∼ 3 to Mhalf = 2.0+4.1
−2.0 × 105M(cid:12), and
[M/L]half = 82+170
−82 , and neither are resolved owing to their
large uncertainties. As such, the true mass and dark matter
content of Leo V remain poorly constrained.

3.2 Metallicities

The spectra for our Leo V member stars have reasonably
high S/N ratios (ranging from S/N ∼ 5 − 32 per pixel), per-
mitting us to measure their individual metallicities from the
Ca II triplet. There exists a well known relationship between
the strength of the 3 Ca II absorption features, located at
8498 ˚A, 8542 ˚A and 8662 ˚A, and the iron abundance, [Fe/H],
for RGB stars. This relationship has been extensively empiri-
cally calculated from comparisons between high and medium
resolution spectra (e.g., Armandroﬀ & Da Costa 1991; Rut-
ledge et al. 1997; Carrera et al. 2007; Battaglia et al. 2008a;
Starkenburg et al. 2010). As shown in Fig. 3, 6 of our 8 po-
tential members are RGB stars. We display the spectra of
these stars, and the ﬁt to their Ca II lines, in Fig. 7. The
other 2 Leo V members are found on the sub-giant and hori-
zontal branch, so we do not measure their [Fe/H] values here,
as the Ca II relation is not calibrated for such stars. We do,
however, show their spectra in Fig. 8 for completeness.

In this analysis, we follow the technique outlined in

4 If we instead use the 1σ lower bound on our gradient
(abs( dv
dχ ) ≥ 1.2 km s−1 per arcmin), this signiﬁcance drops to
52.7%.

Figure 6. Here we show how the velocities vary as a function of
projected distance along the preferred kinematic major axis. A
strong gradient can be seen for the Leo V members (red stars),
equivalent to 4.1+2.8
−45.6 km s−1/kpc). The posi-
tions of the candidate BHB star (star 18) and the CMD outlier
star (star 20) are shown as open stars.

Collins et al. (2013). First, we normalise our spectra by
smoothing each one with a Gaussian ﬁlter, as a means of
ﬁtting the continuum. We then divide the spectrum by this
ﬁt. The continuum and Ca II lines are then ﬁt using a model
that is essentially a ﬂat continuum plus 3 Gaussians, located
at the positions of the three Ca II lines. The best ﬁts are de-
duced through chi-squared minimisation, and are displayed
as solid red lines in Fig. 7. From this model, we can then ex-
tract the equivalent widths of each Ca II feature, and use the
relation of Starkenburg et al. (2010) to infer the [Fe/H] of
our Leo V member stars. This relation uses only the equiv-
alent widths of the 2nd and 3rd line, as the 1st Ca II line
can suﬀer from contamination from skylines (Battaglia et al.
2008a). For our analysis, this is convenient, as some of our
spectra show very weak 1st Ca II lines, which can be diﬃ-
cult to ﬁt, while the 2nd and 3rd lines are much stronger.
We combine these into a reduced equivalent width (EW ) as
described in Starkenburg et al. (2010). In table 3 we present
the measured EW and [Fe/H] for each of our RGB member
stars.

We ﬁnd that Leo V is metal poor, with the metallic-
ities of the 6 RGB stars ranging from [Fe/H]= −3.1 dex
to [Fe/H]= −1.9 dex. The mean metallicity and spread is
[Fe/H]= −2.48 ± 0.21 dex, and σ[F e/H] = 0.47+0.23
−0.13. This
makes Leo V more metal poor than it was reported to be
in Walker et al. (2009a), where they measure a metallic-
ity of [Fe/H]= −2.0 dex. However, this was derived from
a co-addition of 5 stars with lower S/N than our spectra,
and from a diﬀerent wavelength regime (centered on the Mg
doublet at ∼ 5200˚A). As such, our analysis provides a more
robust estimate of the metallicities of Leo V member stars.

tions suggests that Leo V was able to self-enrich its stellar
populations over time. This conﬁrms that Leo V is indeed
a dwarf galaxy, as opposed to a globular cluster, even in
the absence of a resolved mass-to-light measurement. This
metallicity spread is shown in Fig. 9, where we plot the
metallicities of all stars with r−mag< 21.1 (i.e., brighter
than the sub-giant branch of Leo V) as a function of their
velocity. The 6 Leo V RGB stars (highlighted in red) stand
out from the Milky Way contamination as a substantially
metal-poor system. There is some over lap in the metallic-
ities at the more metal-rich end of the distribution, and so
there could be some concern that some of our Leo V stars are
actually Milky Way dwarf star interlopers, much like our ex-
cluded star 20 (which can be seen as the black point amidst
the Leo V stars). While the Ca II-[Fe/H] relation does not
hold for dwarf stars, it can produce similarly metal-poor re-
sults. As such, it could be possible that more of our Leo V
members are also Milky Way contaminants. We investigate
this possibility by assessing the strength of the Na I doublet
absorption feature, centered around λ ∼ 8200˚A for all stars
within our database. The strength of this doublet is sensitive
to the surface gravity of a star, and tends to be prominent
in dwarf stars, whilst it is weak or non-existent in giants.
As such, we would not expect to see Na I lines in our Leo
V sample. Indeed, none of our conﬁrmed Leo V members
show absorption at the location of the Na I doublet, while
all our likely contaminants (including excluded star 20, as
seen in Fig. A2) show signiﬁcant Na I absorption. This lends
further conﬁdence that our Leo V stars are indeed bonaﬁde
members. Finally, the metallicity dispersions in Milky Way
ultra-faint dwarfs are typically found within the range of
0.3-0.6 dex (Kirby et al. 2013), so seeing such a spread to
high metallicities in Leo V is not unusual.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Comparison with previous studies

The dynamics of Leo V had previously been reported on
by Belokurov et al. (2008) and Walker et al. (2009a). Using
the MMT/Hectochelle spectrograph, they measured veloc-
ities for 5 stars in the central ∼ 3 rhalf of Leo V, as well
as two potential members at much larger distances (∼ 15(cid:48)
or > 10 rhalf ). They derived the global kinematics of Leo
V using all members, and also based solely on the 5 central
members (as the 2 at large radii are most probably stripped
stars, if they are associated with Leo V). Their global re-
sults of (cid:104)vr(cid:105) = 173 km s−1 and σvr = 3.7+2.3
−1.4 are very simi-
lar to those measured with method 1 within this paper (i.e.,
assuming no velocity gradient) of (cid:104)vr(cid:105) = 172.0+2.3
−2.1 km s−1
and σvr = 4.0+3.3
−2.3. Our sample of stars also contains several
which overlap with the sample of Walker et al. (2009a), so
we can compare the agreement of our measurements in more
detail.

In total, there are 5 stars in common between this study
and that of Walker et al. (2009a). Of these 5, 3 are likely
members. We detail the velocities of these overlap stars in
table 4. We assess the agreement between our dataset and
that of Walker et al. (2009a) by calculating at what level
the two velocities are consistent with one another, based

(from left to right) the Na I doublet (8183˚A and 8195˚A) and the
Ca II triplet (8498˚A, 8542˚A and 8662˚A). None of our proposed
members show any signiﬁcant absorption at the location of the
Na I doublet, which is consistent with them being RGB stars.

on their respective errors (δσ in table 4). Star 30 is clearly
a failure in either our data set, where we measure vr,i =
57.6 ± 2.7 km s−1, or that of Walker et al. (2009a), where
they measure vr,i = −274.1 ± 4.3 km s−1. Examining the
spectrum for this object (shown in Fig. 10), we see that
the Ca II triplet is clearly visible, and consistent with our
velocity (black spectrum) over that of Walker et al. (2009a)
(red dashed spectrum). As this star is not a member of Leo
V in either analysis, this discrepancy would not eﬀect the
results presented here, nor within Belokurov et al. (2008)
and Walker et al. (2009a).

For the remaining 4 stars, it seems there is some system-
atic diﬀerence between the two datasets. The velocities typ-
ically diﬀer by ∼ 5 km s−1, causing them to be discrepant at

the 1−2σ level. These diﬀerences could either arise from the
diﬀerent wavelength regions used to measure the velocities
(Ca II triplet vs. Mg I/Mg-b triplet for Walker et al. 2009a),
the diﬀerence in resolution between the two spectrographs
(R ∼ 6000 for DEIMOS vs. R ∼ 20000 for Hectochelle), the
diﬀerence in S/N between the two studies (while Walker
et al. 2009a do not provide their S/N values, their spectra
were not high enough S/N to derive individual metallicities,
implying that our spectra have higher S/N ratios), or binary
stars present in our overlapping sample, which could cause
small shifts in velocity between observations. For this latter
point, if all our overlap stars were binaries, it would imply a
very high binary fraction within Leo V. Unfortunately, given
the diﬀering set-ups, the systematic diﬀerences are diﬃcult
to probe in detail. As the global results for the two studies
are in good agreement, it is unlikely that they signiﬁcantly
eﬀect the modelling of the kinematics for Leo V.

As mentioned above, the spectra within Walker et al.
(2009a) did not possess the requisite S/N ratios to probe
the [Fe/H] for individual Leo V stars. By creating a com-
posite spectrum of their 5 central members, they measured
an average metallicity of [Fe/H]= −2.0 ± 0.2. This value im-
plied that Leo V was more metal rich than expected, based
on the mass-metallicity relation of Kirby et al. (2013). Our
higher S/N spectra allowed us to measure this more accu-
rately, and as a result, we ﬁnd a more metal-poor value for
Leo V of [Fe/H]= −2.47 ± 0.21. This places Leo V back on
the Kirby et al. (2013) mass-metallicity relation, as can be
seen in Fig. 11, with a strikingly similar average metallicity
to other dSphs of comparable luminosity.

and that of Walker et al. (2009a). The black solid lines show the
spectra with wavelengths corrected to our velocities, while the red
dashed lines show those stars corrected to the velocities of Walker
et al. (2009a). In general, the spectra are indistinguishable, except
for star 30 (with vr,i = 57.6, from our study. This spectrum is
clearly incompatible with the velocity derived in Walker et al.
(2009a) of vr,i = −274.1 km s−1.

Our measured velocity gradient across Leo V is substan-
tial, with dv
dχ =
−71.9+50.8
−45.6 km s−1kpc−1. Owing to the small sample size of
this study, the uncertainties associated with this gradient
are large, but the gradient remains substantial even at its
1σ lower limit of 21.1 km s−1kpc−1. If we take this result at
face value, the gradient measured for Leo V is signiﬁcantly
larger than any that have been measured in ultra faint dwarf
galaxies. In fact, the only other ultra faint dSph that has
a measured velocity gradient is the Hercules dwarf galaxy,
dχ = 16 ± 3 km s−1kpc−1 (Ad´en et al. 2009). This gra-
with dv
dient has been argued by several authors to be a telltale sign
that Hercules is on the brink of total disruption from either
tidal stripping or shocking (Ad´en et al. 2009; Martin & Jin
2010 , K¨upper et al. 2016 in prep).

to a close encounter with the Milky Way in the past (sim-
ilar to what is assumed for Hercules). By comparing the
direction of our measured gradient with the angular sep-
aration between Leo V, its potential group members, and
the Galactic centre, we can deduce which of these sources is
the most probable source of disruption. We measure a pre-
ferred axis for the velocity gradient of θ = 123.6+15.5
−29.6 deg.
This is slightly misaligned with the photometric axis of Leo
V (θphot = 90 ± 10 deg, Sand et al. 2012), although con-
sistent within the measured uncertainties. We ﬁnd that the
direction of the velocity gradient is most consistent with the
Galactic centre (θLV−GC = 110.9 deg, see Fig. 12). For com-
parison, the angular oﬀset between the velocity gradient and
the positions of Leo II, Leo IV, Crater 1 and Crater 2 are
θLV −LII = −11.6 deg, θLV −LIV = 170.9 deg, θLV −C1 =
174.5 deg, and θLV −C2 = 168.3 deg respectively.

This, combined with evidence in deep imaging from
Sand et al. (2012) for mass loss and stream-like substruc-
ture around Leo V, supports a tidal interaction with the
Galactic centre for the cause of the large velocity gradient.
This is perhaps at odds with some models of the orbit of
the Leo IV, Leo V, Crater 1 and 2 association, which place
the pericentre at 10s of kpc from the Galactic centre (e.g.,
Torrealba et al. 2016b). Additionally, our updated metal-
licity measurement for Leo V places it ﬁrmly back on the
mass-metallicity relation, while one might expect a tidally
disrupting system to have a higher than average [Fe/H] if it
has lost an appreciable fraction of its stellar component due
to tidal forces. Hercules also has a metallicity consistent with
its luminosity, and so in this respect, these two dSphs seem
to face the same questions as to their true nature. However,
given the large luminosity range allowed for a given metallic-
ity in the luminosity-metallicity relation, these system could
lose most of their stellar mass while still remaining consis-
tent with the relation. Perhaps these two systems have only
begun to lose their stars recently, having now lost the ma-
jority of their dark matter halos (Pe˜narrubia et al. 2008),
and as such, they have not lost enough stars to have dra-
matically moved from this relation. If this is the case, the
progenitors of these systems would have very similar total
luminosities to their present day values.

Without proper motions for Leo V, we cannot be cer-
tain of its true orbital history, but in the absence of such
measurements, the kinematic data point towards a scenario
wherein Leo V is on the brink of dissolution.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented kinematics and metallicities for 8 mem-
ber stars in the Leo V dwarf galaxy, derived from spectra

Figure 11. Luminosity vs. metallicity ([Fe/H]) for the Milky Way
dSph galaxies. The universal mass-metallicity relation from Kirby
et al. (2013) is over-plotted as a dashed line, with the 1σ scatter
indicated by the shaded cyan region. Most of the data presented
are taken from (Kirby et al. 2013), with additional data compiled
from Kirby et al. (2015a); Simon et al. (2015) and Martin et al.
(2016b). Leo V is indicated with a red star, and is now clearly
consistent with the value of [Fe/H] for a galaxy of its luminosity.

ruption, can we use the direction of the gradient to deter-
mine the source? Based on numerical modelling of disrupt-
ing dwarf galaxies by Klimentowski et al. (2009), one ex-
pects that, for a dwarf galaxy near the apocentre of its orbit
such as Leo V, any tidally induced gradient in stars close to
the dwarf galaxy (the ‘inner tails’) should point radially to-
wards the source of its disruption. In the Klimentowski et al.
(2009) models, this is the Galactic centre. Leo V is tenta-
tively assumed to be part of an association with the faint
dwarf galaxy Leo IV, and outer halo cluster, Crater 1, owing
to their similar distances (all are found at ∼ 180 − 200 kpc)
and radial velocities (Belokurov et al. 2014; Voggel et al.
2016). Owing to their positions on the same Great Circle
as these 3 objects, it has been suggested that Leo II and
Crater 2 may also be a part of this association (although
kinematics are required in the case of Crater 2, Torrealba
et al. 2016b). Given this association, it could be that Leo V
has had an interaction with one of its fellow group members.
Alternatively, it could be on an orbit that would have led

taken with Keck II DEIMOS. We measure a systemic veloc-
ity for the system of (cid:104)vr(cid:105) = 170.9+2.1
−1.9 km s−1. We are not
able to well-resolve the velocity dispersion of the system,
measuring an upper limit on σvr of ∼ 2.3 km s−1. As such,
we cannot adequately constrain the dark matter content of
Leo V, and we calculate a mass-to-light ratio that is con-
sistent with zero within 1σ ([M/L]half = 82+170
−82 M(cid:12)/L(cid:12)).
From the metallicity spread of the RGB stars in the sys-
tem, we can conﬁrm an iron spread (−3.1 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ −1.9)
indicative of an extended star formation history. As a re-
sult, we conﬁrm that Leo V is truly a dwarf galaxy, not a
stellar cluster. The average metallicity of the Leo V sam-
ple, [Fe/H]= −2.47 ± 0.21 dex, is consistent with the mass-
metallicity relation of Kirby et al. (2013)

While the velocity dispersion is not resolved, we
have detected a strong velocity gradient, equivalent to
71.9 km s−1 kpc−1, across Leo V. With a position angle of
θ = 123.6+15.5
−29.6 deg, this gradient points towards the Galac-
tic centre. This gradient is much stronger than would be
expected from rotation alone, and appears to dominate the
internal dynamics of system. Combined with the presence
of an extended HB population for Leo V (Belokurov et al.
2008; Walker et al. 2009a; Sand et al. 2012), we argue that
this velocity gradient is a result of Leo V dissolving after a
previous close passage with the Milky Way.

Leo V is one of several recently discovered ultra-faint
systems for which tidal stripping or shocking processes have
been oﬀered as an explanation for their present morphologies
and kinematics. If tidally disrupting systems are common
within the Milky Way, it may imply that these systems are

not as centrally dense as cosmological simulations predict,
and may have an impact on the number of luminous satellite
galaxies we expect to ﬁnd around the Galaxy.

APPENDIX A: PROPERTIES OF POTENTIAL
MEMBER STARS NOT INCLUDED IN
ANALYSIS

In this appendix, we present and discuss the spectra of 2
stars with velocities similar to Leo V, that we have excluded
from our analysis.

The ﬁrst star is a BHB candidate that has a reasonably
Leo V like velocity of v ∼ 165 km s−1, but a velocity uncer-
tainty of 26 km s−1. It is located at ∼ 2.5rhalf from the centre
of Leo V. BHB stars typically have less distinct Ca II lines,
and given the low S/N of this spectrum (S/N = 3.0 per
pixel), shown in in Fig. A1, constraining the velocity of the
star is incredibly challenging. There are 3 prominent spikes
at the Ca II position, but these could also be noise spikes.
Our velocity calibration does take other lines into account,
but these three lines are the strongest features available to
us. Given its imaging colours, and a tentative velocity mea-
surement, we consider this star worthy of reporting as a
plausible candidate member, in the event of future, deeper
spectroscopic studies of Leo V.

Finally, we show the spectrum of the bright, blue star
with velocity consistent with Leo V. It’s spectrum looks very
much as one would expect a foreground dwarf star to look,
with reasonable Na I absorption lines ( 8200˚A) and strong
Ca II lines. Ca II lines tend to be less pronounced in young
blue loop stars, and there is no other evidence in the ob-
servations of Leo V for a signiﬁcant, recent star formation
event. As such, we exclude this star from our analysis as a
foreground contaminant.

Figure A1. Spectrum for the BHB ‘candidate’. Owing to the
low S/N , the velocity uncertainties are so large that it could not
be included in determining kinematic properties for Leo V, owing
to our enforced quality cut of 15 km s−1, but we highlight it as a
potential member star for future observations.

than a young blue loop star. As such, we determine that this star
is a contaminant from the Milky Way halo, and exclude it from
our kinematic analysis.
