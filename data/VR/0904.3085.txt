Open Clusters ASCC21 as a Probable Birthplace
of the Neutron Star Geminga

V.V. Bobylev and A.T. Bajkova

Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory, Russian Academy of Sciences, St-Petersburg

Abstract–We analyze the encounters of the neutron star (pulsar) Geminga with open
star clusters in the OB association OriOB1a through the integration of epicyclic orbits into
the past by taking into account the errors in the data. The open cluster ASCC21 is shown to
be the most probable birthplace of either a single progenitor star for the Geminga pulsar or a
binary progenitor system that subsequently broke up. Monte Carlo simulations of Geminga–
50 km s−1 have shown that
ASCC21 encounters with the pulsar radial velocity Vr =
0.52 Myr. In
close encounters could occur between them within
−
25 pc from
addition, the trajectory of the neutron star Geminga passes at a distance of
the center of the compact OB association λ Ori at about t =
0.39 Myr, which is close to
the age of the pulsar estimated from its timing.

INTRODUCTION

Young massive O and B stars can run away from the stellar group (an open cluster or an
OB association) where they were born. Such stars are called runaways; they are identiﬁed
by high (> 30 km s−1) space velocities. Two main runaway scenarios are known (see the
review by Hoogerwerf et al. 2001). The ﬁrst scenario is related to the evolution of a binary
system and the explosion of one of the components as a supernova. In this case, one of the
components can receive a high kick velocity due to an asymmetric explosion and a signiﬁcant
mass loss by the binary. A massive runaway star and its former companion, a neutron star
or a black hole, are the breakup products of such a binary. The second scenario is related to
the dynamical evolution of an initial stellar group. Mutual encounters of close binary and
multiple systems are the most eﬃcient ejection mechanism.

The best-known runaway stars, such as ζOph, ξPer, µCol, AE Aur, ζPup, and others,
were discovered by Blaauw (1961; 1993). Probable parent associations were determined for
some of them. Hoogerwerf et al. (2001) considered the problem of determining the most
probable birthplaces of pulsars using data from the Hipparcos (1997) Catalogue. Based on a
more complete list of runaway OB stars, Schilbach and R¨oser (2008) showed that the parent
open cluster or OB association to which they belonged could be pinpointed with a high
90%) of the O stars in the solar neighborhood (within < 1 kpc),
probability for most (
including those that were previously believed to be ﬁeld stars.

≈

The problem of determining probable birthplaces of nearby young neutron stars associ-
ated with the Gould Belt (Popov et al. 2003; Motch et al. 2006) is of great interest. One of
these stars is Geminga (PSR J0633+1746), to which this paper is devoted.

In contrast to the overwhelming majority of pulsars, Geminga was discovered in 1973
as a gamma-ray source from the SAS-2 satellite. The impulsive behavior of its signals was
ﬁrst detected in the X-ray (Halpern and Holt 1992) and gamma-ray (Burch et al. 1992;
Bignami and Caraveo 1992) bands and, only several years later, in the radio band (Kuzmin
and Losovsky 1997; Malofeev and Malov 1997). The age of the Geminga pulsar, 0.342 Myr,
was ﬁrst determined from its timing (P/2 ˙P , where P and ˙P are the pulsar period and its ﬁrst
derivative, respectively) by Bignami and Caraveo (1992). Bignami et al. (1993) identiﬁed
this pulsar in the optical band with a 25.5-magnitude object and were the ﬁrst to determine
the components of its proper motion. The distance to the Geminga pulsar, r = 150
400
pc, was ﬁrst estimated by Halpern and Ruderman (1993).

The present-day quality of the spectra for pulsars is too low for their radial velocities to
be determined. At the same time, an arc-like feature produced by the interaction of pulsar
emission with the interstellar medium is observed near the neutron star Geminga (Caraveo
et al. 2003; Shibanov et al. 2006). Modeling the shape of this arc-like feature (Caraveo
et al. 2003) yielded a constraint on the magnitude of the radial velocity for the Geminga
100 km s−1). Given this constraint, the radial velocity is a free parameter in
Vr
pulsar (
our studies.

One of the ﬁrst hypotheses that the birthplace of the Geminga pulsar is associated with
the Local Bubble was proposed by Gehrels and Chen (1993). According to this hypothesis, a
positive radial velocity of the pulsar should be adopted. In the opinion of Frisch (1993), this
pulsar originated in the Orion OB association, suggesting that its radial velocity is negative.
The modeling by Smith et al. (1994) showed that the compact OB association λOri (Cr 69)
at Vr

100 km s−1 could be a suitable birthplace of the pulsar.

Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, Caraveo et al. (1996) were the ﬁrst
to determine the trigonometric parallax of the pulsar, πtr = 6.36
1.74 mas, which corre-
±
sponds to its distance r = 157+59
−34 pc. They also determined the proper motion components,
4 mas yr−1. The search for a probable birthplace of
µα cos δ = 138
the neutron star Geminga carried out by Pellizza et al. (2005) based on these data led them
to conclude that this birthplace could be in a fairly close solar neighborhood (r = 90
240
50 Myr) CasTau association or to the edge
pc) and is related either to the relatively old (
of the younger (

11 Myr) OB association Ori OB1a.

≈

The currently available HST observations of Geminga (Faherty et al. 2007) showed
1.3 mas (r = 250+120
that the new parallax, πtr = 4.0
−62 pc), diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the
previously published one (Caraveo et al. 1996), which should inevitably aﬀect the results of
searching for its birthplace.

±

The goal of this paper is to determine the most probable birthplace of the Geminga
pulsar by simulating its motion in space into the past using the most resent data on open
star clusters (Kharchenko et al. 2007) and individual stars (van Leeuwen 2007). The objec-
tives set here are accomplished using the method of statistical Monte Carlo simulations–we
determine the epicyclic orbits of objects by taking into account the corridor of errors in the
observational data.

Four groups,Ori OB1a, b, c, and d (Blaauw1964), with ages of 11.4

2,
and < 1 Myr, respectively, are identiﬁed in the Orion association (Brown et al. 1994).
According to Kharchenko et al. (2005), the Ori OB1a association includes four open clusters,
ASCC16, ASCC18, ASCC20, and ASCC21, with ages of 8.5, 13.2, 22.4, and 12.9 Myr,
respectively. The question of whether each of them is an open cluster or an association is
still under discussion. In this respect, ASCC16, which is also designated as the group 25 Ori
(Brice˜no et al. 2005; McGehee 2006), is the best-studied open cluster. Here, a fairly dense
concentration of young T Tauri stars was detected. Their analysis led McGehee (2006) to
conclude that this is a gravitationally unbound group rather than an open cluster.

The OB–T association/cluster λOri is located near the Ori OB1a association. A compact
HII region (S264) is associated with the star λOri. In a wider neighborhood of the center
5◦ (40 pc), the association is surrounded by a ring of molecular clouds and
with a radius of
gas (Maddalena and Morris 1987). This star-forming region was studied in a series of papers
by Dolan and Mathieu (1999, 2001, 2002). Based on Str¨omgren photometry, they estimated

the distance to the open cluster λOri, 450

1◦ (8 pc) around the central star
were shown to concentrate in a sky ﬁeld with a radius of

of the cluster λOri (Sp: O8III) with an age of
5.5 Myr. In a wider neighborhood of the
5◦ (40 pc), they detected several concentrations of young T Tauri
center with a radius of
stars. On the whole, Dolan and Mathhieu concluded that: (a) star formation in the cluster
λOri ceased
1 Myr ago after the supernova explosion; (b) the group of young massive stars
is currently not gravitationally bound; and (c) star formation currently goes on in the clouds
B30 and B35 located on the periphery of the association.

METHODS

Orbit Construction

In this paper, we use a rectangular Galactic coordinate system with the axes directed away
from the observer toward the Galactic center (l = 0◦, b = 0◦, the X axis), along the Galactic
rotation (l = 90◦, b = 0◦, the Y axis), and toward the North Galactic Pole (b = 90◦, the Z
axis). The corresponding space velocity components of the objects U, V, W are also directed
along the X, Y, Z axes (Kulikovskii 1985).

The epicyclic approximation (Lindblad 1927, 1959) allows the orbits of stars to be con-
structed in a coordinate system rotating around the Galactic center. We assume that the
origin of the coordinate system coincides with the local standard of rest and that the stars
move along epicycles in the direction opposite to the Galactic rotation. We use the method
in the form given by Fuchs et al. (2006):

relative to the local standard of rest with (U, V, W )LSR = (10.00, 5.25, 7.17) km s−1 (Dehnen
and Binney 1998). Following Fuchs et al. (2006), we adopted ρ0 = 0.1M⊙ pc3, which gives

Statistical Simulations

In accordance with the method of statistical Monte Carlo simulations, we compute 3 million
orbits for each object by taking into account the random errors in the input data. For each
pair of orbits belonging to two diﬀerent objects, we calculate the encounter parameter equal
to the minimum separation between the objects ∆r =

∆X 2(t) + ∆Y 2(t) + ∆Z 2(t).

The parameters of the objects are distributed normally with a dispersion σ. As was
shown by Hoogerwerf et al. (2001), the random errors in the equatorial coordinates of stars
and open clusters do not aﬀect noticeably the simulation results. As a result, the errors
are added only to the proper-motion components, parallax, and radial velocity of an object.
The parameters are listed in the table.

q

The distribution of the encounter parameter in a certain neighborhood can be represented
as a histogram (see below). We calculated the expected distribution F3D of the minimum
separation ∆r using a formula from Hoogerwerf et al. (2001),

For such open clusters as ASCC21 and λOri, the tidal radius is 13.7

respectively (Piskunov et al. 2008). Therefore, in our simulations, we choose the character-
istic radius of the neighborhood in which close encounters of stars with clusters occur to be
10 pc.

Analysis of the orientation of the shock front ahead of the pulsar yields a constraint on
its radial velocity. A fairly symmetric shock was detected near the neutron star Geminga
(Caraveo et al. 2003; Shibanov et al. 2006). Modeling its shape suggests that the radial

two open clusters, ASCC21 and λOri. The two dotted lines in Fig. 1 indicate the pulsar
trajectories calculated with extreme (

3σ) values of the proper-motion components.

Our simulations of the Geminga encounter with the cluster ASCC21 yielded the following
results. Out of the 3 million orbits obtained by introducing random errors with a given

that HIP 22061 and HIP 29678 ran away from the neighborhood of the cluster λOri about
1.1 Myr ago. Figure 5a shows the expected distribution F3D of the minimum separation
∆r calculated from Eq. (4) for the dispersion σ = 1.2 pc. This is an example of very close
encounters; thus, for example, the separation between the two stars was only
0.12 pc in
two model cases.

The conclusion that HIP 22061 and HIP 29678 are the remnants of a dissociated binary or
multiple system is in agreement with the analysis of the motion of these stars performed by
Hoogerwerf et al. (2001) using Hipparcos data. However, Hoogerwerf et al. (2001) questioned
the involvement of the star λOri in the event that led to the breakup of the multiple system
HIP 22061–HIP 29678. This conclusion was drawn from the fact that the point on the
celestial sphere with coordinates (l, b) = (196◦.5,
12◦.0) was found as a probable current
position of the parent cluster for HIP 22061 and HIP 29678, which diﬀers by one degree from
the current position of the center of the cluster λOri. The velocity diﬀerence eﬀect can be
seen in Fig. 1. More speciﬁcally, if the cluster λOri were located one degree to the left, then
all three trajectories (λOri, HIP 22061, and HIP 29678) would intersect at the same time,

The kinematic paradox in the motion of the star λOri was pointed out by Maddalena
and Morris (1987). It lies in the fact that the position of the star λOri in the past does not
coincide with the center of the ring of molecular hydrogen clouds expanding with a velocity
10 km s−1. According to

coordinates reﬂect the position of the supernova at the time of its explosion). The position
of the ring center remarkably coincides with the point of intersection of the trajectories for
HIP 22061 and HIP 29678 that we found, namely, (l, b) = (194◦.6
0◦.2).
The errors here were estimated from the relation ε(l,b) = arctan(σ/r), where r = 438 pc, and
from the dispersion σ = 1.2 pc found above (Fig. 5a).

at the time of the event — it could occur no later than 1.12 Myr ago. Moreover, it follows
from the above assumption that the point of intersection of the HIP 22061–HIP 29678 pair
indicates the position of the center of the cluster λOri at a time of
1.12 Myr. This suggests
that the supernova explosion that gave rise to the ring of molecular clouds around the cluster
λOri occurred no later than

1.12 Myr.

We can see that the pair of runaway starsHIP22061 and HIP 29678 is of great interest in
studying the evolution of the cluster λOri. We consider the close encounters of HIP 29678
with the Geminga pulsar found above as a purely geometric eﬀect. If both these objects
(HIP 29678 and Geminga) resulted from the evolution of a binary progenitor system, then
its trajectory before its breakup could be arbitrary and the encounter of the HIP 22061–HIP
29678 trajectories would not be as shown in Fig. 1.

1 DISCUSSION

Based on an isochronous age estimate for the cluster ASCC21, 12.9 Myr (Kharchenko et al.
2005), we can estimate the minimum mass of a post-main sequence star. For example, based
on Fig. 11.5 from Sakhibullin (2003) for log t = 7.11, we obtain an estimate of the mass for
15M⊙. On the other hand, there are no stars bluer than a B1.5V-type star
such a star,
(HIP 25861) in the cluster ASCC21. Therefore, the more massive B0V-type stars, whose
15M⊙, can be assumed to have already left the main sequence.
masses are known to be
A more detailed comparison with isochrones, for example, from Schaller et al (1992), also
leads to a similar conclusion.

We may conclude that in the case of ASCC21, the mass of the probable progenitor star
for the Geminga pulsar satisﬁes well the condition for the formation of neutron stars with

The cluster λOri is considerably younger. Dolan and Mathieu (2002) estimated the mass
and age of the most massive cluster star, λOri, to be 26.8M⊙ and
5.5 Myr, respectively.
Thus, the higher-mass stars have already evolved. Therefore, the cluster ASCC21 appears
more preferable in the scenario with a single progenitor star for the Geminga pulsar.

As was pointed out by Yakovlev et al. (1999), the characteristic (i.e., dynamical, de-

period, which are also observed in the Geminga pulsar (Jackson et al. 2002), are among the
factors that aﬀect the dynamical age estimates for pulsars. On the other hand, the neutron
star Geminga exhibits thermal radiation, which allows its age boundaries to be estimated
by comparison with neutron star cooling models. Thus, for example, we can see from the
data in Table 3 and the cooling curves in Fig. 20 from Yakovlev et al. (1999) that the upper
limit for the Geminga age in the blackbody model reaches
1 Myr. Similar estimates of
the age boundaries for the Geminga pulsar, 0.1

Myr is consistent with the time intervals considered. For this scenario to be realized, ﬁrst,
the Geminga parallax must fall within the range 2–3 mas (Fig. 3) and, second, there must
be traces of the supernova remnant around ASCC21, which is not yet observed. On the
other hand, such a remnant could disperse completely in

Thus, the scenario for the formation of Geminga in the cluster ASCC21 at t =

The assumption that the progenitor star from which the Geminga pulsar subsequently
originated was formed in ASCC21 appears more realistic. This viewpoint is in agreement
with the scenario by Smith et al. (1994), who believe the Geminga pulsar to be either the
remnant of a runaway OB star ejected from the Orion OB1a association and exploded as
a supernova outside this group or the result of a supernova explosion in the cluster λOri.
Cunha and Smith (1996) provide arguments that the ring of molecular hydrogen clouds
around the cluster λOri has an age of 300–370 thousand years, in good agreement with the
dynamical age estimate for the neutron star Geminga.

CONCLUSIONS

Analysis of the possible encounters of the neutron star Geminga with open clusters in the Ori
OB1a association in the past led us to conclude that the open cluster ASCC21, a member of
the Ori OB1a association, is the most likely candidate for the birthplace of either a binary
progenitor system that subsequently broke up or a single progenitor star. Monte Carlo
simulations of the encounters of this pair with Gemingas radial velocity Vr =
50
km s−1 showed that close encounters of the pulsar with this open cluster could occur within
0.52 Myr. In addition, the trajectory of the Geminga pulsar passes

In addition, the kinematics of the pair of runaway stars HIP 22061–HIP 29678 under the
assumption that they were members of the cluster λOri in the past allowed us to obtain an
independent estimate for the time of the dynamical “event” as a result of which the star
λOri received an additional kick—it could occur no later than 1.12 Myr ago.
