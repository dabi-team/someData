Abstract: We present the temporal changes of the diffusion coefﬁcient K of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) at
the Earth orbit calculated based on the experimental data using two different methods. The ﬁrst approach is
based on the Parker convection-diffusion approximation of GCR modulation [1]: i.e. K ∼ V r/dI where dI is the
variation of the GCR intensity measured by neutron monitors (NM), V is the solar wind velocity and r is the radial
distance. The second approach is based on the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) data. It was suggested that

Introduction

1
The galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) transport in the helio-
sphere is governed by the four important processes: out-
ward convection by the solar wind, inward diffusion, parti-
cle drifts (gradient, curvature and on the neutral sheet) in
the turbulent interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) and adia-
batic cooling. Estimation of the local electromagnetic con-
ditions near the Earth orbit is possible by establishing mod-
ulation parameters as diffusion coefﬁcient, density gradi-
ents etc. It is especially essential when in situ measure-
ments are absent. It is the basic knowledge needed to study
space weather prediction. A major issue in GCR transport
research and space weather studies is how GCR particles
propagate through the heliosphere, and how interact with
the interplanetary space especially in the inner heliosphere
near the Earth’s orbit. The essential signiﬁcance of charac-
terizing GCR propagation is evident, because this will lead
to a practical capability in space weather forecasting which
has important consequences for life and technology on the
Earth and also in the interplanetary space.

The ﬁrst theoretical description of cosmic ray transport
coefﬁcients was done by Jokipii [6] by formulation the
quasilinear theory (QLT) for GCR diffusion. One limiting
assumption of the QLT is that in the guiding center approx-
imation transport of the GCR particles is not perturbed by
the IMF turbulence. This assumption is inaccurate especial-
ly for the highly anisotropic strong turbulent heliosphere.
This classical approach has been improved by higher-order
theories of GCR particles turbulent ﬂow. Thus the theo-
ries considering nonlinear effects have been introduced [7]-
[11]. A validity of the QLT for the GCR particles of the en-
ergy > 1GeV is conﬁrmed by the weakly nonlinear theory
(WNLT) [10], nonlinear parallel diffusion theory (NLPA)
[12] and in papers [13, 14, 11] (see e.g. [15]).

However, for selecting correct set of modulation param-
eters used in theoretical modelling (especially diffusion co-
efﬁcients, etc.), one criterion remains the most important,

if it is possible, to estimate them from the experimental da-
ta, supported by appropriate theory.

Observations of GCR intensity and anisotropy by neu-
tron monitors (NMs) and IMF ﬂuctuations can be success-
fully used for establishment of various parameters charac-
terizing modulation of GCR by the solar wind. In this pa-
per we present the temporal evaluation of the parallel dif-
fusion coefﬁcient of GCR particles for rigidities to which
NMs respond. Parallel diffusion coefﬁcient Kk, equivalent
3Kk
to parallel mean free path (MFP) l
v , determined by
physical properties of interplanetary medium, is a very im-
portant parameter to study the transport of energetic parti-
cles in the heliosphere, especially for a solar event (SEP)
connected with the space weather prediction [16, 17].

and radial gradient (cid:209)
rn of GCR calculated based on the
GCR anisotropy data (Ahluwalia et al., this conference I-
CRC 2013, poster ID: 487 [5]), we estimate the temporal
changes of the radial gradient (cid:209)
rn of GCR at the Earth’s or-
bit. As a ﬁnal point, determination of the parallel diffusion
coefﬁcient Kk (equivalent to parallel MFP l
k) of GCR par-
ticles according to Quenby [18] and Hedgecock [19] for-
mulas will be performed for minimum conditions of solar
activity.

2 Convection-diffusion approximation
It has been shown that ∼ 75 − 80% of the 11-year varia-
tion of the GCR intensity can be interpreted based on the
diffusion−convection model of GCR propagation [20, 21].
So, the long-term variations of GCR intensity can be de-
scribed by the Parker transport equation, invoking the
isotropic convection-diffusion approximation [22]. In s-
cope of this approximation one can calculate changes of
the parallel diffusion coefﬁcient Kk as follows:

crease of Kk for the recent solar minimum 23/24 is clearly

is strongly polarity dependent in accord with the drift theo-
ry with a considerable enhancement especially in the mini-

4 Radial gradient of GCR
On the basis of the long term changes of the product l
rn
calculated based on the GCR anisotropy data (Ahluwalia
et al., this conference ICRC 2013, poster ID: 487 [5]) and
parallel diffusion coefﬁcient Kk of GCR found above (ﬁg-
ure 1), we estimate also the radial gradient (cid:209)
rn of GCR
at the Earth’s orbit. The results of our calculations are pre-
sented in ﬁgure 4. One notes that the radial gradient (cid:209)
rn of
GCR oscillates with a period ∼ 11year solar activity cycle
with a weaker solar polarity dependence, being in agree-
ment with the previous calculation reported by Chen and
Bieber [23] and with PIONEER/VOYAGER observations
[24].

5 Transport coefﬁcient for minimum

conditions of solar activity

Transport coefﬁcients (e. g. diffusion coefﬁcient of GCR)
may be derived from a precise knowledge of the regular in-
terplanetary magnetic ﬁeld values and its ﬂuctuations (tur-
bulence) [18]. The derivation of the parallel diffusion coef-
ﬁcient given by Jokipii [6, 25] and Hasselmann and Wib-
berenz [26] is best illustrated in a simple way by following
the Kennel and Petschek [27] formulation given in the con-
text of magnetospheric particle scattering.

In order to accurately obtain the parallel mean free path
(diffusion coefﬁcient) of GCR particles in the heliosphere,
a method of power spectrum density of the interplanetary
magnetic ﬁeld turbulence has been used [19]. In this paper
we compare the values of parallel MFP obtained by means
of formulation of Hedgecock [19] and Quenby [18]. We
consider frequency range 10−6 − 10−5Hz, responding for
modulation of the GCR particles detected by NMs.

The appropriate parallel MFP can be expressed in terms
of the power spectrum density of the interplanetary mag-
netic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations according to Hedgecock [19] and
Quenby [18], respectively:

parallel MFP according to both formulas (5) and (6) are in
good agreement with each other. One can see that parallel

(A < 0). On the other hand in the last minimum period with
record level of the GCR intensity ever measured by NMs,
calculations for Bz transverse component show an increase

6 Conclusions

1. The parallel diffusion coefﬁcient Kk, obtained based
on the isotropic convection-diffusion GCR modula-
tion model, generally displays ∼ 11-year variation,
but with strong polarity dependence (∼ 22 years). A
signiﬁcant increase is observed in the minimum e-
pochs of solar activity, especially in the A < 0 mag-
netic polarity period. An anomaly increase of Kk in
recent solar minimum 23/24 is clearly seen, as well.

2. We calculate parallel mean free path l

k of GCR
based on the experimental data of the IMF. Its value
is polarity dependent in accord with drift theory and
oscillate with a period of ∼ 11-years solar activity
cycle.

3. On the basis of the long term changes of the GCR
anisotropy we show the ∼ 11-year variation of the
radial gradient (cid:209)
rn of GCR being in good agreement
with the PIONEER/VOYAGER observations.

4. Parallel mean free path l

k calculated based on the
By transverse component of the IMF is strong po-
larity dependent with large increase in A < 0 for
1985-1987. In the last minimum epoch of solar activ-
ity with record level of the GCR intensity ever mea-
sured by NMs, calculations for Bz transverse compo-
nent of the IMF show an increase in the changes of
the parallel mean free path.
