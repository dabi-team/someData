ABSTRACT
Digitalization is changing how people visit museums and explore
the artifacts they house. Museums, as important educational venues
outside classrooms, need to actively explore the application of
digital interactive media, including games that can balance en-
tertainment and knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we introduce
RelicVR, a virtual reality (VR) game that encourages players to
discover artifacts through physical interaction in a game-based ap-
proach. Players need to unearth artifacts hidden in a clod enclosure
by using available tools and physical movements. The game relies
on the dynamic voxel deformation technique to allow players to
chip away earth covering the artifacts. We added uncertainty in the
exploration process to bring it closer to how archaeological discov-
ery happens in real life. Players do not know the shape or features
of the hidden artifact and have to take away the earth gradually

but strategically without hitting the artifact itself. From playtest-
ing sessions with eight participants, we found that the uncertainty
elements are conducive to their engagement and exploration expe-
rience. Overall, RelicVR is an innovative game that can improve
players’ learning motivation and outcomes of ancient artifacts.

1 INTRODUCTION
Museums, as one of the most important educational institutions
outside schools, aim to exhibit and introduce historical and cultural
artifacts from multi-sectors to the general public. However, in a

time when most students are visual learners and are familiar with
games, they are more attracted by and engaged in the content with
active exploration and interaction [12]. The young generation has
gradually become impatient with traditional modes of instructions,
such as using text or audio explanations, and disengaged with these
conventional paradigms of exploration and knowledge acquisition
[33]. Today’s museums, like other learning institutions, are trying to
keep with technological and social changes and looking into ways to
transform inactive exhibitions into interactive experiences to better
meet their audiences’ preferences, especially those of younger gen-
erations. Game-based learning is one of the interactive approaches
that can satisfy their needs. A well-designed game-based learning
context would balance gaming and learning and can benefit players
twofold by (1) motivating them to learn the knowledge with a high
level of engagement with the enjoyable game content [26], and
(2) guiding them with a deeper understanding of complex settings
in the games [8]. These advantages of game-based learning make
games suitable to be embedded in the context of museums to make
the exploration of artifacts active and engaging.

In the discovery of ancient artifacts, uncertainty is always a chal-
lenge for archaeologists. Excavation or unearthing of relics is one
of the most important and exciting parts to eliminate uncertainty.
Based on this feature, Henan Museum has launched "the archaeo-
logical blind box," a small brick with a random mini-artifact hidden
inside it. It requires the visitors to use mini tools to sweep the dirt
away to discover and collect the hidden artifact. By offering the
young generation opportunities to stimulate them to explore the
relics and implicitly encourage them to learn cultural knowledge,
the blind boxes started a wave of amateur archaeology in China
with 170,000 pieces sold from December 2020 to April 2021 [18, 36].
On the other hand, uncertainty is also an essential element in video
games. Well-designed uncertainty elements in a game could moti-
vate players to start and continuously keep players engaged in the
game [3, 5, 11, 25]. The combination of archaeology and gaming
provides a chance to blend knowledge and uncertainty together
in a game to motivate players to acquire knowledge and enjoy the
learning process.

Virtual reality (VR) games can be an ideal medium to achieve
such a combination and enhance understanding of cultural knowl-
edge through an immersive, active, and fun experience. VR expands
the space and affordances of real-world museums and transforms
them into immersive virtual environments that can incorporate
creative and imaginative elements. 3D virtual gaming worlds can
provide unlimited interactive possibilities and experiences at a low
cost. People can access these experiences remotely, which is valu-
able when there are restrictions on time, cost, or distance, especially
during the COVID-19 period. With its active experimentation and
high immersion, VR games can enhance constructive, situated, and
experimental learning [31].

We built a VR archaeology educational game, RelicVR, to enrich
the museum visiting and learning experience. Our game provides
a game-based learning environment, which emulates a simplified
archaeological process of discovering ancient artifacts but with
innovative gameplay elements. The archaeological process involves
a set of actions such as chipping and digging away the earth that
envelops a hidden artifact (see Figure 1). The players need to wield
tools in their hands and move around to chip away the clod of earth

that wraps the relic. Since players initially have no knowledge of
the artifact inside the clod, the uncertainty during gameplay is
intended to heighten their senses and focus on the chipping process
to prevent damaging the artifact. In short, RelicVR aims to make the
exploration of ancient artifacts an active, fun, and engaging process.
We conducted a short playtesting with eight players to evaluate the
effects of gaming for learning about relics. Results showed that the
game can provide a fun and engaging experience to players and is
still be able to help them learn the features of the artifacts.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Games for Archaeology
Developments in the field of archaeology have changed the way we
present archaeological artifacts and discoveries today. The growing
interest in digitalization and turning the process interactive has
a considerable appeal to archaeologists wishing to present their
research to the public. Early in 2002, Watrall [35] stated that ar-
chaeologists must realize the potency of interactive media and
embrace it. The educational potential of interactive games has been
increasingly addressed over the past years, especially for pre-teen
learners, as game-based learning can keep them more engaged and
make their efficient learning [33]. Some prior research has shown
the overall success of applying educational games to enable stu-
dents to learn about the archaeological investigation (e.g. [1, 7]).
At the University of Illinois, the VRchaelogy Lab [9, 29, 30] had
some surprising findings of how VR environments can enhance the
learning of basic archaeology knowledge to college students and
non-professionals.

2.2 Games for Museums
Efficient approaches that balance educational purposes and enter-
tainment are desired in today’s museums. The use of video games
can increase general interests, especially from young generations,
in exploring cultural artifacts and improve their experience [34].
Studies have indicated that a gamified application can increase
participants’ involvement, motivation, enjoyment, and overall ex-
ploratory experiences [2, 28].

Recent advances in VR have led to new possibilities in museum
touring because of its capability to create immersive artificial worlds.
There have been projects in which VR is used to recreate virtual
living spaces in museums [17, 19, 27]. Jung et al. [13] found that
entertainment experienced from VR can enhance the overall mu-
seum visits. However, most of the existing games for archaeology
lack engaging interaction between players and the virtual environ-
ments. There are nearly no games that introduce artifacts from an
archaeologist’s discovery perspective. We argue that the scenery in
VR alone is not enough to engage players and arouse their interests
in the cultural heritage. In The Grasshopper: Games, Life, and Utopia
Suits [4], Cooper defines the playing of a game as “the voluntary
attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles." To lead players to
this self-motivated act, it is also necessary to include appropriate
methods in the design of a successful game experience. Compared
with existing games (e.g., [9, 29, 30]), which are somewhat more
oriented to teach more serious concepts and emphasize more on

RelicVR: A Virtual Reality Game for Active Exploration of Archaeological Relics

CHI PLAY ’21, October 18–21, 2021, Virtual Event, Austria

the learning side than on gameplay, RelicVR has more gaming fea-
tures and is intended to be more interactive, encourage exploratory
engagement and focus, and allow learning to be fun.

2.3 Uncertainty
Uncertain elements can make the gameplay experience engaging,
enjoyable, and playful [3, 5, 15]. According to Costikyan [5], typi-
cal uncertain sources in a game include performative uncertainty,
solver’s uncertainty, player unpredictability, and randomness. In
terms of VR content, Xu et al. [39] evaluated the effect of uncertainty
in a VR exergame. They found that uncertainty could improve the
exergame experience by increasing players’ energy exertion. We
believe involving uncertainty elements in our game would give
players a better gaming and learning experience. To achieve this ef-
fect, we obscure the object with a clod of earth that wraps the object
entirely. Since the players do not know the structure and features
of the hidden object, they need to carefully plan their actions and
develop reasonable speculations based on the parts that have been
revealed to avoid hitting the relic and damage it. In addition, if the
object is hit, the game provides a dissonant sound, akin to negative
feedback—something that players would want to avoid. According
to Costikyan’s classification, our approach could be classified as per-
formative uncertainty because there is uncertainty in the outcome
of the physical actions of the players and the gradual unearthing of
the artifact. As the players reveal more hidden parts of the artifact,
they are also going through a process of verifying their hypotheses
or speculations in an iterative manner and continuously update
their knowledge of the artifact.

3 RELICVR
We designed and developed RelicVR, a first-person perspective VR
game that combines active exploration and knowledge acquisition
of archaeological artifacts. The game intends to enrich the learning
experience with such artifacts by embedding them into a game
that simulates a simplified procedure of archaeological discovery.
RelicVR is made to be run in the Oculus Rift S. It was developed
using C# on the Unity3D platform (version 2020.3.5f1) with the
Oculus Integration SDK (28.0.0). In this section, we introduce its
overall concepts, game world scenario, and interactions in the vir-
tual environment (VE).

3.1 Concept
The principle behind RelicVR was inspired by archaeological activ-
ities in the real world. Instead of implementing the whole archaeo-
logical investigation approach, we mainly adapted the excavation
phase in the game due to its interactive nature. In RelicVR, players
start with little information of what is hidden in the clod of earth.
When they use tools to remove the chunks of earth from the clod,
they face a sense of uncertainty due to the unknown shape, struc-
ture, and features of the relic. As such, they need to be focused on
the actions and observe the outcome of each physical activity. Such
a process can be iteratively reinforced as more parts of the relic
come to light.

We set up a few invisible trigger points in different places around
the relic according to its features. When players hit a trigger point,
a dialog box with text describing some features would appear and is

accompanied with audio to capture players’ attention. As more and
more details of the artifact are exposed, players gradually increase
their understanding by reading or listening to the prompted descrip-
tions and careful observations of its visual details, now visible to the
naked eye. In this first version of the game, we designed three dialog
boxes for each relic to introduce it from different perspectives.

RelicVR aims to drive players to engage in active exploration
and learning. It gives the players a similar role to an archaeologist
to explore the relic actively. The players start out by observing
a large clod of earth placed at the center of the VE, but can only
have a limited understanding of the relic (see Figure 2a). Driven
by curiosity, the players are encouraged to discover what lies in-
side the clod. The game requires physical motions in the form of
digging with selected tools and walking around to try to unearth
the artifact within a limited time. This process requires continuous
planning and problem-solving and frequent updates to the mental
model of the object. During the exploration process, they also face
similar challenges like archaeologists—they need to carefully plan
their actions to avoid damaging the artifacts. After players have
successfully excavated the artifact, they can get general information
from an additional dialog box and put the relic into their collection.
While not implemented in the current version, the collection can be
shown to their friends, which can give them a sense of achievement.

3.2 Game World
In the first version of the game, we used a mysterious temple (Fig-
ure 2b) as the gaming environment to increase the adaptability of
artifacts from different eras and cultures. The temple does not refer
to any cognizable mono-cultural motif. The daylight in the scene
moves around the temple to give players a sense of time elapsing as
the game progresses. Several spotlights for illuminating the artifact
are hung high in the temple to focus players’ attention. Fallen walls
and rocks are randomly placed outside the temple to give a sense
of ancientness and historical allure and mystery to the environ-
ment. As the players look around, they can see that the scene is a
semi-enclosed space containing tools on a table and an unexplored
artifact encased in a cubic clod of earth.

Two relics are included in the current version of RelicVR. The
first one is the Arhat (Luohan) Sculpture from the Metropolitan Mu-
seum of Art in New York (Figure 2d, referred to as Arhat hereafter)
[24]. The second relic is the bronze head with a gold mask from
Sanxingdui Museum in China (Figure 2e, referred to as Gold Mask
hereafter) [23]. We extracted the information from their official
website and integrated it into the game. These two relics are scaled
to approximately the same volume to minimize the differences in
the gaming experience. Their sizes are about a human’s height to
increase the level of exploration. In addition, it provides players a
chance of detailed observations of the relic which is less likely to
be achieved in conventional museum visits.

The players can choose a hammer or a shovel on the workbench
based on their preference, as shown in Figure 2c. The hammer
makes players feel more powerful and more flexible to handle,
while the shovel is thinner but has a broad blade. The shovel can
easily remove large areas of clod chunks but also increases the risk
of hitting the artifacts. This is a trade-off between the two tools
that the players need to balance carefully.

and Sanxingdui bronze head with a gold mask, respectively.

3.3 Interactions
The interactions in RelicVR mimic real-world actions to increase
immersion and physical activity. Players need to grab one of the
tools by pressing the grip button on the controller after pointing the
virtual hand at the tool at a short distance or remotely at a longer
distance. To simulate how digging is performed in real life, players
are required to hold the grip button during the whole excavation
activity. Players need to wave their arms to dig. The actions in
the VE match the players’ actions in the physical world. Since the
artifacts and clod are designed to be of human size, players might
need to raise their arms and squat to clean the dirt at the top and
bottom regions.

In the virtual world, the players are encouraged to move physi-
cally around the clod enclosure to achieve coordinated movements
in the virtual scene. The players can also use the joysticks on the
controllers to move or turn around. However, such movements or
turnings are only suggested when the player needs to make large
positional adjustments in the VE.

Similar to real archaeological excavations, the players should
control their actions carefully to avoid damaging the relic during the
excavation process. Warnings are given using a (dissonant) sound
that simulates striking the artifact. The choice of the negative sound
feedback is to encourage players to avoid hearing it by not hitting
the artifact.

The levels of difficulty in RelicVR can vary greatly according
to the complexity of shapes and volume. For the current version,
we selected models of similar complexity and calculated their ap-
proximate volume. We set a health bar and timer for the relic as
elements of the game: the reduction of the health bar and timer has
no effect on the artifacts and gameplay but would create tension
and motivation for players to complete the task within the allot-
ted time and minimize the reduction of health points. The health
bar hovers above the artifact and always faces the player’s view.
A strike on the relic would reduce 1 point. Time begins to count
down from when the game starts and is shown on the upper middle
part of the screen. We found that for the current models, 7 minutes
of playtime and 40 health are suitable for most players to keep a
balance between having a degree of pressure and feeling motivated
to complete the task.

3.4 Innovation
Recent advancements in graphical computation power and develop-
ment of the marching cubes algorithm [20] allow the deformation
of objects that are non-trivial and are very detailed in real-time.
To our knowledge, RelicVR is the first game that explores the use
of dynamic voxel functions in VR to combine active gaming and
exploratory learning together. Furthermore, instead of exploring
a vast area of a VE such as [6, 16], RelicVR attempts to focus play-
ers in active explorations of a human-scale 3D area. The physical

RelicVR: A Virtual Reality Game for Active Exploration of Archaeological Relics

CHI PLAY ’21, October 18–21, 2021, Virtual Event, Austria

interaction afforded by VR devices enables physical activity by
players during gameplay. Furthermore, the inclusion of uncertainty
elements in the game can make players immersed and focused on
playing the game.

4 PLAYTESTING
4.1 Experiment
We have conducted a preliminary playtest with eight players (3
females and 5 males, aged between 19 to 25; M = 21.5, SD = 2.07).
They were recruited from a local university. Half of them experi-
enced the Arhat version, while the remaining experienced the Gold
Mask version. The players were first introduced to the game and
the use of the devices. They were asked to use tools to excavate
the artifact enclosed within the clod. In addition, they were told
to keep in mind the time they had and try to avoid damaging the
artifact by not hitting it during the excavation process. At the same
time, they needed to remember the details from the dialog boxes
that would appear after discovering a key point, if possible. After
experiencing the game, they were asked to complete a quiz with 6
fill-in-the-blank questions to assess how much they remembered
after playing the game. Answers to these questions were derived
from the content of the dialog boxes. In addition, we gave them
two questionnaires, a core module of the Game Experience Ques-
tionnaire (GEQ) [10] and an adapted version of web-based learning
tools evaluation scales (WBLT) [14] to elicit their perceived gaming
and learning experience with RelicVR. At the end of the experiment,
we conducted a semi-structured interview asking them about their
feelings and thoughts about the game.

4.2 Results and Discussion
Overall, the eight players were satisfied with the experience in
RelicVR. Figure 3 summarizes the results of GEQ and WBLT. Based
on the ratings, the players perceived a positive gaming experience
in RelicVR in terms of competence, immersion, flow, and positive
affect (the ratings in these categories were all above neutral), while
they felt less tension/annoyance and negative affect (below neutral).
On average, players gave lower-middle ratings in the challenge cate-
gory, which shows a moderate level of difficulty in the game. Based
on our results, RelicVR also provided a good learning experience.
All eight players were able to answer most of the questions cor-
rectly (M = 4.88, SD = 0.83) after experiencing the game. As shown
in Figure 3b, the players perceived RelicVR as a good learning tool
in learning, design, and engagement (all above neutral).

During the interview, all eight players reported that RelicVR was
more interesting than conventional museum visits, where artifacts
could only be seen from a distance and are enclosed behind glass
windows, a process that is typically non-interactive and impersonal.
On the other hand, four players (P2, P4, P5, P6) mentioned that in
RelicVR, the process of excavating by hand forced them to be close
to the relic and be focused on it. Coupled with the assistance of
text and audio introduction, they reported a deep impression of
the relic and its information. P4 said, “The dialog boxes at different
key points were good to let me know about the artifact. When they
came out, I could have some rest and time to watch and appreciate
their physical appearance, of which I still have a clear memory after
the game.” P3 and P7 said that they enjoyed the uncertainty in the

exploration process. Based on our observations, they were always
looking forward to seeing what the artifact would look like and
trying carefully not to hit the object when clearing the earth.

P1 and P2 said that the game should make more explicit the
connections between playing in the game and learning and have
a better balance between them, though they thought RelicVR was
a great learning tool. They mentioned that, by separating the de-
scription of the relics into multiple dialog boxes connected to the
corresponding components of the relic, they got a better learning
experience than reading a long description in one single place. How-
ever, they also argued that the learning experience should be further
improved. Externally, because the timer was continuously count-
ing down, they felt somewhat anxious to excavate the unfinished
parts. Internally, they could not wait to explore more about the relic
because the gaming elements were more appealing to them. To a
certain extent, balancing the entertainment and education elements
is often a challenge in games for learning. To provide a better learn-
ing experience, we plan to explore when the best time is to deliver
knowledge related details in RelicVR; it should either be embedded
in the game just like the current version, or be provided before
or after the gaming part. On the other hand, it is also necessary
to compare and derive the most suitable completion time which
can give tension or pressure to players to complete the tasks but at
the same not to let them feel overwhelmed or overly anxious. P4
expected more tools in the game, especially the tools that can be
used to do elaborate and more precise excavations. In short, while
improvements can be made to RelicVR, the players seem to have
enjoyed the combination of active exploration and uncertainty of
the discovery process that the game brings.

5 FUTURE WORK
For macro-level interaction, we plan to include the possibility of
collecting the artifacts that players unearth as a first priority. As a
shared value of professional archaeologists and Henan Museum’s
blind boxes show, the function will enhance the sense of achieve-
ment of players and could motivate them to play the game in the
long-term, as the game could include a wide range of artifacts, some
of which could be released for special occasions and in a limited
way. Having more artifacts can also be used to provide levels in the
game. These artifacts could be from different cultures of various
sizes and shape complexities which would require players to per-
form more demanding activities and digging patterns to unearth
them.

Moreover, a richer micro-level interaction is desirable. We plan to
include more excavation tools and vary their effects on the clod to
provide diverse experiences for players. In addition, to increase the
level of difficulty and challenge, we can follow a similar approach
to the different block types in Minecraft [32]. We can apply various
materials and mix them into the clod enclosure. Different mixes will
lead players to use different strategies and elicit greater levels of
exertion during gameplay since the required energy and feedback
are different for each mix. On the other hand, a recent study has
proposed an attachable device to the VR handheld controllers to
provide weight and center of gravity simulation in VR [22]. We
think such device or the concept can be used in RelicVR to provide

force feedback on users’ hands or arms to simulate real excavation
actions.

From a research perspective, RelicVR can be an ideal testbed for
evaluating the effect of unknown and uncertain factors on game-
play and learning experiences in VR. In addition, it can be used to
explore the effect of exertion levels [38, 39], body positions [37],
and viewing perspectives [21, 40]. In addition, research has looked
into the effects of display types for exergames [39, 40]. It is also
interesting to evaluate and compare the experience and outcomes
of game-based learning between VR and traditional displays (i.e.,
immersive vs. less-immersive experiences).

Finally, we also plan to refine other aspects of the game like
optimizing further of completion condition of each artifact, letting
players customize completion time, and adding a health bar system
to balance game challenge and gameplay experience.

On a business level, RelicVR has great potential to be used in
cooperation with museums to enhance the visitors’ experience and
promote popular science education. We have plans to contact local
museums to explore ways that RelicVR can be used in any of their
processes and enhance their visitors’ experiences.

6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented RelicVR, the first VR game that en-
courages players to discover historical artifacts through physical
interaction and a game-based approach. By using dynamic voxel
deformation in the game, it was able to add uncertain elements in
the exploratory process—e.g., the unearthing of the artifact in a
gradual but calibrated way to avoid hitting and damaging it. Our
playtesters found that the uncertainty in the process helped en-
hance their experience. Also, the innovative interaction method
has the potential to improve players’ learning motivation and out-
comes. Overall, RelicVR is an innovative game that can engage and
immerse players in active exploration of archaeological artifacts.
