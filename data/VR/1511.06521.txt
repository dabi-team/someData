Abstract

The steady compressible Navier–Stokes–Fourier system is considered, with either Dirichlet or
Navier boundary conditions for the velocity and the heat ﬂux on the boundary proportional to the
the
diﬀerence of the temperature inside and outside.
adiabatic constant γ appearing in the pressure law p(̺, ϑ) ∼ ̺γ + ̺ϑ and the growth exponent in
the heat conductivity, i.e. κ(ϑ) ∼ (1 + ϑm), and without any restriction on the size of the data, the
main ideas of the construction of weak and variational entropy solutions for the three-dimensional
ﬂows with temperature dependent viscosity coeﬃcients are explained. Further, the case when it is
possible to prove existence of solutions with bounded density is reviewed. The main changes in the
construction of solutions for the two-dimensional ﬂows are mentioned and ﬁnally, results for more
complex systems are reviewed, where the steady compressible Navier–Stokes–Fourier equations play
an important role.

In dependence on several parameters, i.e.

1 Introduction

This survey paper is devoted to the study of weak and variational entropy solutions to the system
of partial diﬀerential equations describing the steady ﬂow of a heat-conducting compressible Newtonian
ﬂuid, i.e. we consider the steady compressible Navier–Stokes–Fourier system. The fact that we want to
have solutions for arbitrary large data results in necessity of dealing with weak (or variational entropy)
solutions; the strong or classical solutions are not known to exist, even for arbitrarily regular data.

Note further that we must be more careful with the choice of correct boundary conditions (b.c.). Recall
that we have to allow the energy exchange through the boundary as for thermally and mechanically
insulated boundary the steady solutions may not exist. More precisely, considering the evolutionary
system with mechanically and thermally insulated boundary and a time-independent external force,
either the energy of the system grows to inﬁnity, or the force is potential and the velocity tends to zero,
the temperature to a constant, and the density solves a certain simple ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential
equation, see [10].

The steady compressible Navier–Stokes–Fourier system attracted more attention in the last few years.
Even though the existence of weak solutions to the steady compressible Navier-Stokes system (i.e. the
isentropic system, or the system, where the exchange of the heat is negligible with respect to other

1

 
 
 
 
 
 
processes) has been studied already in the seminal monograph [18] by the end of the last century, the
ﬁrst results for the system studied here go back to the end of the ﬁrst decade of this century. Indeed,
P.-L. Lions in his monograph considered the system of equations describing the steady ﬂow of a heat
conducting compressible ﬂuid, however, he assumed that the density of the ﬂuid is bounded a priori in
some Lp-space for p suﬃciently large. As we shall see later, to prove the bound of the density in a better
space than L1 is one of the main diﬃculties for our system of equations. The L1-norm, i.e. the total
mass of the ﬂuid, is a quantity which must be known and hence, in a physically reasonable model, it is
the only given bound for the density we may expect.

The ﬁrst existence result for such formulation appeared in 2009 in the paper [22]. The proof was based
on the technique developed for the stationary Navier–Stokes equations in the papers [21] and [35], which
for the Navier boundary conditions for the velocity and suﬃciently large adiabatic exponent γ allowed
to prove existence of solutions with bounded density and “almost bounded” velocity and temperature
gradients, see Chapter 12.1.1 for more details. Note that in this case even the internal energy balance
is valid. This result was later extended in [23] to a larger interval for γ and also for the homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions (replacing the internal energy balance by the total one), however the value
of γ still remained far above the largest physically reasonable value γ = 5/3, i.e. the monoatomic gas
model. Note also that both above mentioned results were proved for a three-dimensional domain and for
viscosities which depend neither on the temperature, nor on the density of the ﬂuid. The corresponding
result in the two-dimensional case can be found in [31].

Later on, in [26] and [27] the authors observed that using directly the estimates from the entropy
inequality one can obtain much better results, especially when additionally the viscosity coeﬃcients
depend on the temperature as
(1 + ϑ). The existence of a solution for the Navier boundary conditions
and any γ > 1 was shown in [14]. Note that the recently published paper [40] claims the existence of weak
solutions for the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity under the same conditions
which guarantee the existence of weak solutions in the case of the Navier boundary conditions. However,
the authors of this paper are strongly convinced that the proof contains a gap in the part concerning the
estimates of the density near the boundary.

Analogous problems (for the Dirichlet boundary conditions) in two space dimensions were studied in
[28] and [34] in the context of Orlicz spaces for the density. Finally, the situation when the viscosity
[0, 1) is the subject of the forthcoming paper [15]. Some partial results in this
behaves as
direction can be found in [16], where only the case γ > 3
2 has been studied.

(1 + ϑα), α

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce the model, the rheological relations
as well as the thermodynamical concept that we use. Then we introduce the notions of weak and
variational entropy solutions and present the main existence results in the case of the three-dimensional
domains. Next section contains a priori estimates for our system (only for the adiabatic constant γ > 3
2 )
to demonstrate why it is reasonable to consider two diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the solutions. Following
section contains all the necessary mathematical tools to deal with our problem. Next we present four
approximation levels for our problem and brieﬂy explain how to prove existence for the last one and
how to pass through several levels to the ﬁrst one. In the subsequent section we show a priori estimates
independent of the ﬁrst approximation parameter and the following section contains the ideas of the limit
passage to the original problem. Note that we restrict ourselves to the viscosity coeﬃcients proportional
to
(1 + ϑ), i.e. to α = 1. The next part of the paper is devoted to presentation of existence results for
several related systems. First we discuss some ideas for proof of the existence of more regular solutions for
γ > 3 in three space dimensions for constant viscosity coeﬃcients and the Navier boundary conditions.
Further we comment on the results in two space dimensions. Finally, we brieﬂy mention few results for
more complex system as e.g. the steady ﬂow with radiation or the steady ﬂow of chemically reacting
gaseous mixture.

∼

We also emphasize that results for the steady state solutions are an important step in analysis of time
periodic solutions. Due to estimates constructed in [22] and [26] it was possible to prove existence of a
weak time periodic solutions to system (1)–(3) in the paper [8]. The result has been generalized in [1] .
In the whole paper, we use standard notation for the Lebesgue space Lp(Ω) endowed with the norm
k · kp,Ω and Sobolev spaces W k,p(Ω) endowed with the norm
k · kk,p,Ω. If no confusion may arise, we
skip the domain Ω in the norm. The vector-valued functions will be printed in bold face, the tensor-
Lp(Ω; R3), and
valued functions with a special font. Moreover, we will use notation ̺

1 to N ; e.g. uivi means

N
i=1 uivi, where N = 2 or 3.

This constitutive relation includes at least two physically relevant cases: if γ = 5/3 it is the generic law

In agreement with the second law of thermodynamics, we postulate the existence of a diﬀerentiable
function s(̺, ϑ) called the speciﬁc entropy which is (up to an additive constant) given by the Gibbs
relation

It is easy to verify that the functions p and e are compatible with the existence of entropy if and only

In this section we present deﬁnitions of weak and variational entropy solutions to our problem. They
diﬀer in the following way: for the weak solution we require that our functions (̺, u, ϑ) fulﬁll all equations
of system (1)–(3) in the distributional sense, while for the variational entropy solutions we do not require
(3) to hold. Indeed, in some situations (we shall demonstrate this in the following section) we do not

have suﬃcient regularity, hence the term ̺
One possible remedy is to consider the internal energy balance. We shall comment on this later; here let
us only mention that the internal energy balance contains term like S(ϑ,
u which is possible to
control only in L1(Ω) and thus any limit passage in this term is diﬃcult to perform. Therefore we shall
use another possibility, namely, we replace the total energy balance by the entropy inequality. The reason
why we cannot expect the entropy balance to hold is the fact that we are not able to keep equality in the
limit passages in two terms and we are obliged to use the weak lower semicontinuity therein. At the ﬁrst
glance it looks like we generalized the deﬁnition of a solution too much. On the other hand, if we add to
the entropy inequality the identity called the global total energy balance which is the total energy balance
2u disappears), we end up with a system for which it is
integrated over Ω (here, the unpleasant term ̺
possible to show that any regular solution fulﬁlling three equalities (weak formulation for the continuity
equation and for the balance of momentum, and the global total energy balance) together with one
inequality (the entropy one) is in fact a classical solution to (1)–(3), i.e. the weak–strong compatibility
holds.

In order to simplify the situation we shall assume that our domain Ω in the case of the Navier boundary
conditions is not axially symmetric. It is connected with the form of the Korn inequality valid in this
case. If Ω is axially symmetric, we have to assume that λ > 0 in (5); the results in this situation can be
found in [14]. We shall comment on them later. We have also to distinguish between the solution to the
Dirichlet boundary conditions (4) and the Navier boundary conditions (5). Moreover, we mostly consider
only the case N = 3. Finally, we take α = 1 in (9).

We have

Remark 1 As mentioned above, any solution in the sense of Deﬁnitions 3 or 4 which is suﬃciently
smooth is actually a classical solution to the corresponding problem. It can be shown exactly as in the
case of the evolutionary system and we refer to [9, Chapter 2] for more details. Indeed, the same holds
also for the weak solutions, i.e. for Deﬁnitions 1 and 2, where the proof is straightforward.

We will also need the notion of the renormalized solution to the continuity equation

4 A priori estimates for γ > 3
2

In this section we present a priori estimates for our problem with both the homogeneous Dirichlet
and the Navier boundary conditions for the velocity. Let us emphasize that these estimates will not be
optimal in most of the cases. They just illustrate that for some values of γ and m one may get estimates

7

which indicate that the weak solution is available, however, in some situations the only hope is the
variational entropy solution. The subsequent computations also indicate how one may obtain estimates
for the approximate problems. Moreover, we assume that l = 0, more precisely L = const. For simplicity
we take in the case of the Navier boundary conditions λ = 0 and assume that Ω is not axially symmetric.
We start with the entropy inequality (31) (note that for suﬃciently smooth solutions it can be deduced
from the total energy balance, in the case of the existence proof a certain version is available for the
approximation), where we use as test function ψ = 1. We have

It remains to estimate the density. In order to simplify the situation as much as possible at this moment,

Recalling that the density is bounded in L1(Ω) (the prescribed total mass) and using Lemma 2 below it
is not diﬃcult to check that the most restrictive terms are I1 and I2 leading to bounds (the details can
be found in [26])

(44)

which comes into play for small γ’s. Under assumptions (43)–(44) we may prove existence of variational
entropy solutions while under assumptions (42), (44) we could prove existence of weak solutions, see [26].
In what follows, using ﬁner density estimates, we weaken the assumptions on γ and m, i.e. we prove
Theorems 1 and 2.

Further we need special solutions to the following problem:

We have (see e.g. [29])

6 Approximation

6.1 Approximate system level 4

Let us now introduce the approximating procedure. For simplicity we consider the Dirichlet boundary
conditions. The proof for the Navier boundary conditions is basically the same. We also set immediately
l = 0 and assume L to be constant. Recall that we have α = 1 in (9). The approximation for l
= 0
and α < 1 can be done similarly. We ﬁx N a positive integer and ε, δ and η > 0 (we pass subsequently
0+, thus the assumption ε suﬃciently small with respect to δ

Both (56) and (57) with (59) are linear elliptic problems. Hence their unique solvability as well as
regularity of the solution is straightforward. Using also Lemma 8 we get (see [22, Lemma 3] for a similar

Lemma 9 Under the assumptions of Proposition 1, for p > 3, the operator T is a continuous and
compact operator from XN ×

W 2,p(Ω) into itself.

To fulﬁll the assumptions of Lemma 7, we need to verify boundedness of possible ﬁxed points to
[0, 1]. As this is the most diﬃcult part of the proof of Proposition 1, we give more

In order to show the strong convergence of density (which is suﬃcient to remove the bars in (83)–(85))

we can combine technique introduced in [18] with some of techniques from [9, Chapter 3].

Using, roughly speaking, as test function in (74) ϕ :=

∆−1̺ε and in (83) ϕ :=

∆−1̺, passing to

7 Estimates independent of δ: Dirichlet boundary conditions

We now present basic estimates independent of δ for the solutions to system (88)–(91). The ﬁrst part
(up to few details) is the same as in the section devoted to the a priori estimates, however, the estimates
of the density are diﬀerent.

7.2 Estimates of the pressure

As shown in the formal a priori estimates, the method based on the pressure estimates by means of the
Bogovskii operator has a natural limitation, namely γ > 3
2 . To avoid this, we apply a diﬀerent idea based
on local pressure estimates. The method was developed in the context of the compressible Navier–Stokes
system in the following three papers [32], [2] and [11]. Note that unlike the heat-conducting case, the
method gives existence of weak solutions to the compressible Navier–Stokes system only for γ > 4
3 . This
problem has been removed in the recent paper [33], using a slightly diﬀerent technique, which, however,
leads in the heat-conducting case to more severe restrictions than the original method.

with C independent of δ. The goal is to get α as large as possible under some conditions on m and γ
which still allow the values for these quantities as small as possible. Indeed, this might be sometimes
contradictory. Here, the situation for the Dirichlet and the Navier boundary conditions diﬀers, as in the
latter we have larger class of possible test functions (only the normal component vanishes on ∂Ω).

We distinguish three possible situations. In the ﬁrst one, the point x0 is “far” from the boundary, in
∂Ω and in the last one x0 is “close” to ∂Ω, but does not belong to it. The ﬁrst case

the second one x0 ∈

8 Estimates independent of δ: Navier boundary conditions

Note that we get in the case when Ω is not axially symmetric estimates (92), (93) and (96) exactly as
for the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Therefore, we only deal here with the estimates of the pressure,
where we closely follow the papers [13] and [14].

As in the previous case, we need to estimate the pressure. We proceed similarly as for the Dirichlet
boundary conditions, however, since we have more freedom, i.e. we have a larger class of the test functions
for the momentum equation, we can get better results here. First of all, in the case when x0 is far from
the boundary, we have again Lemma 12. However, it is now possible to use the information from the
second term on the l.h.s. as it is possible to recover it for x0 close and on the boundary. The diﬀerence
appears near the boundary. The situation is more complex here. For the sake of simplicity, we restrict
ourselves to the case of the ﬂat boundary ∂Ω. The general case can be treated using the standard change
of variables which ﬂattens the curved boundary. This is the reason why we require the boundary to be
C2. More details are given in [13] or in [14].

Let us hence assume that we deal with the part of boundary of Ω which is ﬂat and is described by
x3 = 0, i.e. z(x′) = 0, x′
1) and τ 1 = (1, 0, 0), τ 2 = (0, 1, 0)
the tangent vectors. Consider ﬁrst that x0 lies on the boundary of Ω, i.e. (x0)3 = 0. Then it is possible
to use as the test function in the approximate momentum equation

R2 with the normal vector n = (0, 0,

Note that if (x0)3 = 0 we get precisely what we need, i.e. estimate (121) (but with supx0∈∂Ω instead of
supx0∈Ω.

However, if x0 is close to the boundary but not on the boundary, i.e. (x0)3 > 0, but small, we loose
control of some terms for 0 < x3 < (x0)3. In this case, as for the Dirichlet boundary conditions, we must
modify the test functions; recall that we require that only the normal component (i.e.
in our case the
third component) of the test function vanishes on ∂Ω. We ﬁrst consider

Nonetheless, using v1 as test function we would still miss control of some terms from the convective term,
more precisely of those, which contain at least one velocity component u3, however, only close to the
boundary, i.e. for x3 < (x0)3/2. Hence we further consider

9.3 Oscillation defect measure and renormalized continuity equation

Our aim is to show that the renormalized continuity equation is fulﬁlled. However, it can be shown
directly only for ̺δ bounded in L2(Ω) which for γ close to 1 is generally not true. Following the idea
originally due to E. Feireisl, we introduce the oscillation defect measure

together with the Navier boundary conditions (the use of them is essential here). Note that for suﬃciently
(cid:1)
smooth solution, the total and the internal energy balances are equivalent (one is just a consequence of
the other one, using the balance of momentum and the continuity equation), however, for only weak
solution, this might not be the case. We further assume that the viscosity coeﬃcients are constants, i.e.
α = 0 in (9) (this is also essential in this approach), hence we prefer to write the viscous part of the stress
tensor in the form S(
u) = 2µD(u) + ν(div u)I. We assume 2µ + 3ν > 0 and consider the pressure law

straightaway that the temperature of the approximate problem is positive a.e.

the L1-estimate of the density, which are independent of k. More details can be found in [22].
A crucial role in the proof of the strong convergence of the density is played by a quantity called the

eﬀective viscous ﬂux. To deﬁne it in this context, we use the Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity

[31]. The existence of weak solutions with similar properties as in Theorem 3 was proved there for γ > 2
and m = l + 1 > γ−1
γ−2 .

11 Weak solutions in two space dimensions

We consider our system of equations (1)–(3) with the boundary conditions (4)–(6) and the total mass
R2. We assume the viscous part of the stress tensor in the form (8) (N = 2)
(7) in a bounded domain Ω
with (9) for α = 1 and the heat ﬂux in the form (10) with (11). Moreover, we take L = const in (6). We
assume the pressure law in the form (20) or for γ = 1 we take

⊂

p = p(̺, ϑ) = ̺ϑ +

̺2
̺ + 1

lnα(1 + ̺)

with α > 0, the corresponding speciﬁc internal energy is

e = e(̺, ϑ) =

lnα+1(1 + ̺)
α + 1

+ cvϑ,

cv = const > 0,

and the speciﬁc entropy is

s(̺, ϑ) = ln

ϑcv
̺

+ s0.

We consider weak solutions to the problem above deﬁned similarly as in Deﬁnition 1 with the correspond-
ing modiﬁcations for the pressure law (189). This problem was studied in [28] for both (20) and (189)
and the result for the latter was improved in [34]. More precisely, we have the following results

As the proof for γ > 1 is easy, we only refer to [28] and consider the pressure law (189). We need to
work here with a class of Orlicz spaces. We therefore recall some of their properties, referring to [17] or
[19] for further details.

Let Φ be the Young function. We denote by EΦ(Ω) the set of all measurable functions u such that

the Orlicz spaces generated by Φ(z) = zβ lnα(1+z). In the range mentioned above zβ lnα(1+z) fulﬁlls the
global ∆2-condition. Recall that the complementary function to z lnα(1+z) behaves as ez1/α
; however, this
function does not satisfy the ∆2-condition. We denote by Ee(1/α)(Ω) and Le(1/α)(Ω) the corresponding

Remark 5 In [28], the authors used the same test function with s = 1. This leads to an L2-estimate of
the density (and hence the limit (̺, u) is immediately a renormalized solution to the continuity equation).
However, this method also requires additional restriction on α and m. Note that here, we are able to get
the estimates for any m > 0 and α > 1; nevertheless, a certain restriction on α in terms of m appears
later, when proving the strong convergence of the density.

36

We can now pass to the limit in the weak formulation of the approximate system (note that we still
do not know whether the density converges strongly) as in three space dimensions. The main task is to
get strong convergence of the density which is based on the eﬀective viscous ﬂux identity and validity of
the renormalized continuity equation, which is connected with the boundedness of the oscillation defect
measure. As the proof is similar to the three-dimensional solutions, we will only mention steps which are
diﬀerent here.

First of all, we may get the eﬀective viscous ﬂux identity in the form

p(̺, ϑ)Tk(̺)

−

µ(ϑ) + ξ(ϑ)

Tk(̺)div u = p(̺, ϑ) Tk(̺)

−

µ(ϑ) + ξ(ϑ)

Tk(̺)div u.

(203)

Next, we introduce the oscillation defect measure deﬁned in a more general context of the Orlicz

∞

−

(204)

(205)

further we verify that this fact implies the renormalized continuity equation to be satisﬁed. Note that
to show the latter we cannot use the approach from the book [9] (or [26]) as there, it is required that
Φ = z2+σ for σ > 0 which we are not able to verify here.

Next we have to show that (205) is suﬃcient to guarantee that (̺, u) veriﬁes the renormalized conti-

nuity equation. We have

Lemma 30 Under the assumptions of Theorem 4, the pair (̺, u) is a renormalized solution to the con-
tinuity equation.

Proof. As the proof is similar (even slightly easier) to the evolutionary case, we give only the main

steps here; for details see also [5, Lemma 4.5].

First we mollify the limit form of the renormalized continuity equation

Now, exactly as in [5, Lemma 4.5] we may pass with k

, employing (205) to get the renormalized
form of the continuity equation for any b as above. Note that we basically need to control Tk(̺δ)
Tk(̺)
in a better space than just L2(Ω); the logarithmic factor is enough. By suitable approximation we ﬁnally
✷
get (34) for any b as in Deﬁnition 5.
The last step, i.e. that the validity of the renormalized continuity equation, the eﬀective viscous ﬂux
identity, and estimates above imply the strong convergence of the density can be shown similarly as in
three space dimensions, thus we skip it. More details can be found in [34].

12 Further results

In the last section we brieﬂy mention some results, where the steady compressible Navier–Stokes
equations are incorporated in some more general systems and the methods explained in the ﬁrst part of
this paper are used to get existence of a solution.

12.1 Steady ﬂow of a compressible radiative gas

The modelling of a radiative gas is a complex problem. We are not going into details of its modelling,
more information can be found e.g. in [16] and references therein. We consider the following system of
equations in a bounded Ω

where the last equation describes the transport of radiative intensity denoted by I. The r.h.s. S is a
given function of I, ω and u, see [16] for more details. The quantity sF denotes the radiative ﬂux and sE
is the radiative energy. The viscous part of the stress tensor is taken in the form (8) with the viscosity
coeﬃcients as in (9) for 0
1. The pressure is considered in the form (14) and the heat ﬂux fulﬁlls
(10) and (11), L is a bounded function (i.e. l = 0 in (12)). The system is completed by the homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity (4) and the Newton boundary condition for the heat ﬂux
(6). We ﬁnally prescribe the total mass of the ﬂuid (7).

The proof is similar to the case without radiation with two additional diﬃculties. One is connected
with radiation, especially with compactness properties of the transport equation and we are not going
to comment on this issue here, the other one is connected with the fact that for α < 1 we loose the nice
structure of the a priori estimates coming from the entropy inequality and the situation becomes more
complex. More precisely, dropping the δ-dependent terms (they can be treated as above), the entropy
inequality (94) provides us only

on the other hand, the values of α below 1 are physically more realistic. More details can be found in

12.2 Steady ﬂow of chemically reacting mixtures

The above system describes the ﬂow of a chemically reacting gaseous mixture of n-components. It is
assumed that the molar masses of the components are comparable, which is assumed e.g. by a mixture
of isomers. We denote by Yk = ̺k/̺ the mass fraction, ̺k is the density of the k-th constituent.

The system is completed by the boundary conditions at ∂Ω

The proof is based on a complicated approximation procedure, where the most diﬃcult part is to
deduce the correct form of the approximate entropy inequality and to estimate all additional terms that
appear there due to approximation. The reason for the bounds γ > 5/3 and m > 1 is, roughly speaking,
the convective term in the total energy balance. To reduce the assumptions on γ and m (both using
improved estimates of the pressure and consider variation entropy solutions) is the work in the progress.

13 Conclusions

The known existence results for the steady compressible Navier–Stokes–Fourier equations for large
data were reviewed. It is well known that strong solutions may not exist. Therefore two diﬀerent notions
of a solution are proposed: the weak and the variational entropy one, where the former includes the
weak formulation of the total energy balance while in the latter, the total energy balance is replaced
by the weak formulation of the entropy inequality and the global total energy balance. More details in
the existence proof for the three-dimensional ﬂows were presented, subject to either the homogeneous
Dirichlet or the Navier boundary conditions for the velocity. The main ideas behind the proof of existence
of more regular solution in the case of the Navier boundary conditions and γ > 3 were explained. In this
case even the internal energy balance is fulﬁlled. The two-dimensional ﬂows for γ almost one were also
studied. Finally, few results for more complex models were presented, where the Navier–Stokes-Fourier
system is combined with other equations.
