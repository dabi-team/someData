Social VR has experienced tremendous growth in the commercial space recently as an emerging technology 
for rich interactions themed around leisure, work, and relationship building. As a result, the state of social 
VR application design has become rapidly obfuscated, which complicates identiﬁcation of design trends and 
uncommon  features  that  could  inform  future  design,  and  hinders  inclusion  of  new  voices  in  this  design 
space.    To  help  address  this  problem,  we  present  a  taxonomy  of  social  VR  application  design  choices  as 
informed  by  44  commercial  and  prototypical  applications.  Our  taxonomy  was  informed  by  multiple 
discovery  strategies  including  literature  review,  search  of  VR-themed  subreddits,  and  autobiographical 
landscape research. The taxonomy elucidates three design areas—the self, interaction, and the environment—
and organizes 10 feature categories and 38 feature variations. The paper reﬂects on how the taxonomy can 
support involvement of new designers, and considers possible expansion and use by researchers.

1  INTRODUCTION 

Social virtual reality (VR) refers to 3D panoramic virtual spaces, typically accessed through head-
mounted  displays,  that  are  primarily  intended  to  support  social  interaction.  Despite  being 
discussed  in  the  literature  over  decades  [7,8,16,17],  only  in  the  past  few  years  have  social  VR 
applications become widely accessible to the public due to affordable VR equipment such as the 
Oculus  Rift  and  HTC  Vive  [55].  Research  into  public  adoption  of  social  VR  has  confirmed  its 
potential for augmenting social interaction across a variety of user demographics [3,45,52,76]. Yet 
emerging  obstacles  in  the  way  of  user  satisfaction  and  wellbeing  have  also  been  discovered, 
reminding us that social VR application design is still in need of improvement. Identity-based 
harassment [11,20,60] and privacy risks [48], particularly regarding marginalized demographics, 
are becoming prominent issues. Other motivations for design include barriers to participation by 
older adults [3] and limitations to social activities [45] and personal expression [52].  

Social VR research has recognized that a barrier to designing solutions for emerging issues, 
and  progressing  social  VR  more  broadly,  is  a  lack  of  clarity  regarding  the  state  of  social  VR 
application design [50,51].  Questions like “how have social VR applications been designed?” are 
difficult to answer because commercial applications are relatively new, and numerous research 
prototypes  are  scattered  across  the  literature.  This  creates  a  barrier  for  new  voices  in  design, 
especially from demographics at risk of emerging issues like older adults and children, and can 
obfuscate the full range of design possibilities even to seasoned designers.  

Following early efforts in the 1990s [7,16], documentation of social VR design choices has been 
reinvigorated in the last few years [36,50,51,66]. The latest documentation encompasses recent 
commercially available applications and with a focus on particular types of design elements such 
as non-verbal communication features [66] and design choices deemed supportive of pro-social 
interaction [50]. While these efforts lend much needed coherence to the design space of relatively 
new social VR offerings, non-commercial social VR applications developed for research purposes 
or private use over the past three decades are absent.

This paper extends efforts into mapping social VR design by presenting a taxonomy of social 
VR design choices informed by 44 commercial and non-commercial applications. We use the word 
taxonomy  quite  deliberately  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  succinctly  categorizing  design 
choices to support rapid comprehension and review for informing future designs.  

2  BACKGROUND 

2.1  Making VR Social 

The fundamental driver behind advancements in virtual reality (VR) has been the capacity for 
presence,  or  the  feeling  of  “being  there”  [30,43].  Introducing  multiple  users  into  the  same  VR 
environment for interaction extends this potential to include social presence or copresence; the 
feeling  of  being  present  and  interconnected  with  other  people  [10,38].  “Social  VR”  [50]  is  the 
modern terminology for applications that enable interpersonal contact in 3D panoramic virtual 
spaces,  typically  through  head-mounted  displays  and  other  technologies  to  capture  body 
movement and communication. The term has come to refer more specifically to VR environments 
designed primarily for supporting social interaction [2,20,58]. This differentiates from solo VR 
experiences [1,44] and VR games [18], the latter in which interaction is sometimes possible but 
not necessarily the main motivation for design or use. 

Efforts to design social VR applications have followed two tracks: applications designed for 
research purposes or private use, and commercial applications that are available to the public. 
The research track has a longer history, gaining popularity in the early to mid 1990s [6,19]. Such 
applications were originally called collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) [4,7,8,12,15,17] and 
originated from academic institutions [7], although some early industry applications also existed 
[39].  While  the  public  was  largely  unable  to  enjoy  social  VR  in  the  1990s  due  to  barriers  in 
technological  capabilities  and  cost,  early  prototypes  like  DIVE  and  MASSIVE  [6,7,16]  were 
responsible  for  foundational  advancements  in  user  embodiment  and  expression  that  are  still 
present  in  social  VR  applications  today.  Design  and  research  with  prototypical  social  VR 
applications continued into the 2000s and into the modern day [2,13,32,62,63,67,73].  

The release of affordable VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive in 2012 and 2016 
paved the way for commercial social VR applications [55]. Popular examples include AltSpaceVR, 
Rec Room, and VRChat, among others. Relative to earlier CVEs that intended to support specific 
contexts of interaction like collaborative work [16], interactions in today’s commercial social VR 
applications  can  be  broad  and,  at  times,  unpredictable.  They  typically  produce  random 
interactions amongst strangers through public virtual areas that support a massive number of 
simultaneous  users.  Some  commercial  social  VR  applications  also  support  interaction  with 
friends, family, and preexisting contacts through private and public social areas. 

The advent of commercially available social VR applications has enabled empirical research 
into how the public use, and want to use, social VR. Some of this research has affirmed social VR’s 
capacity for social presence and potential to augment social life [20,48,52], and for a variety of 
demographics including children [46], older adults [3], long distance romantic couples [76], and 
marginalized  identities  [20].  Discoveries  about  early  public  adoption  of  social  VR  have  not  all 
been  positive  however.  Reports  of  online  sexual  violence  and  harassment  have  propagated 
through popular media and research [5,54,60], particularly effecting women and ethnic minorities 
[20] and taking various forms like verbal harassment, simulated touching, and displaying graphic 
content in the virtual environment [11]. Furthermore, Maloney and colleagues found an alarming 
lack  of  barriers  around  child-adult  interactions  [47],  which  can  render  children  susceptible  to 
sexual predators and inadvertent exposure to adult content. Beyond interpersonal harm, empirical 
research  has  conveyed  other  user  struggles  and  preferences  for  design  progress.  Movement 
mapping techniques [65] can invoke ageing stereotypes and pose a barrier of use for older adults 
[3].  Limitations  with  non-verbal  communication  have  posed  difficulties  during  one-to-one

interactions between friends [52]. Users have also asked for general increases in connectivity in 
and out of social VR [45].  

2.2  Documenting Social VR Design 

Since at least the 1990s social VR researchers have recognized the value of documenting the social 
VR design space as to way to inform design progress and solutions to emerging user problems. 
Benford and colleagues unpacked the designs of the DIVE and MASSIVE prototypes in 1995 as to 
a way to inform and motivate pursuit of design issues around user representation and expression 
in  social  VR  [7].  Churchill  and  Snowdon  also  documented  DIVE  and  MASSIVE,  among  other 
leading CVEs of the day, in their 1998 review of the design space [16]. 

In the last three years researchers have reinvigorated pursuits to document social VR design, 
with  a  particular  focus  on  new,  commercially  available  applications  [36,50,51,66].  McVeigh-
Schultz and colleagues’ mapping of “the social VR design ecology” in 2018 and 2019 was partially 
motivated by issues of interpersonal harm in social VR, noting that social VR design plays a role 
in  “shaping  particular  kinds  of  social  practice”  [51].  Informed  by  autobiographical  landscape 
research (the researchers’ personal use of social VR applications) [51] and interviews with social 
VR  industry  experts  [50],  they  discovered  a  series  of  design  choices  in  seven  commercially 
available social VR applications deemed supportive of pro-social interaction. These design choices 
broadly  involved  “aesthetics  of  place”  to  make  users  feel  like  they  were  situated  in  familiar 
environments,  “communicative  affordances  and  social  mechanics”  like  emojis  and  handshake 
gestures,  and  features  intended  to  shape  social  norms  and  ease  users  into  socializing  such  as 
grilling virtual burgers over a campfire. Kolesnichenko and colleagues also used that industry 
expert  interview  study  to  more  pointedly  document  the  design  of  user  avatars  in  commercial 
social VR, including the ability to create humanoid and non-humanoid avatars [36]. Tanenbaum 
and colleagues, noting limitations around user expressiveness in virtual environments, developed 
an  inventory  of  non-verbal  communication  design  choices  in  10  commercial  social  VR 
applications [66]. These choices were organized into categories including movement & proxemic 
spacing, facial control, and gesture & posture. 

In this paper we extend recent efforts to catalogue the social VR design space in two ways. 
One, we expand documentation of social VR design to include both commercial applications and 
non-commercial applications designed for research or private purposes. Commercial social VR 
applications are less than 10 years old, yet non-commercial social VR applications stretch back 
over three decades. Second, our efforts are purposely devoid of intent to find design choices “for” 
a particular purpose or end goal, be it pro-social interaction [50], user embodiment [7], or non-
verbal communication [66]. Of course, a benefit of these narrow lenses applied in prior work is 
specificity and granularity in discovered design choices. However, design choices outside of those 
lenses  can  be  left  undiscovered.  We  intended  to  not  only  document  design  choices  across 
commercial and prototypical social VR applications, but to categorize them into rapidly digestible 
design areas—we call this a design taxonomy. 

3  METHOD 

3.1  Relation to Prior Work 

This paper represents the continuation of a previously published work [33]. This paper offers an 
expanded literature review, a review of Reddit, and autobiographical landscape research. 

3.2  Summary of Method 

We  conducted  a  four-step  discovery  process  over  a  12-month  period  to  identify  social  VR 
applications and design choices to serve as the basis of a design taxonomy. These steps were: 1) 
a search of scholarly databases to identify literature about social VR applications; 2) a review of 
. 

 
4 

Handley et al. 

reference lists from the literature discovered in the previous step to identify further literature 
describing social VR application designs; 3) a review of VR-related online communities on Reddit 
(called  subreddits)  to  identify  additional  social  VR  applications  and  features;  and  4) 
autobiographical landscape research [19] with commercially available social VR applications. 

A total of 44 social VR applications were discovered (see tables 1 and 2). Fifteen were identified 
as  publicly  or  commercially  available  applications.  The  other  26  were  non-commercial 
applications created for research or private use. A total of 38 unique design choices within the 
social VR applications were discovered. A preliminary taxonomy of social VR design choices was 
created  after  step  1  (scholarly  literature  review)  through  a  card  sorting  exercise  [64].  This 
involved  the  research  team  collaboratively  organizing  and  re-organizing  discovered  design 
choices  into  emerging  themes  based  on  their  commonalities.  The  taxonomy  was  iteratively 
refined  and  expanded  through  further  card  sorting  sessions  after  each  subsequent  step.  We 
elaborate on each discovery step below. 

3.3  Search of Scholarly Databases for Literature on Social VR Application Design 

We conducted a literature review using the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, 
Google Scholar, and our university library’s online database (comprising over 970,000 sources of 
journals, books, and proceedings). The following search terms were used on each site: social VR, 
social virtual reality, virtual reality, virtual worlds, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Collaborative Virtual 
Environment. Five researchers individually reviewed 10 pages of search results for each term per 
website, resulting in a total of 4550 search results reviewed per person. Discovered literature was 
saved for a full review if the title or abstract mentioned 1) the term “social VR” and/or 2) a VR 
environment seemingly designed, or studied in its capacity, to facilitate interaction between users 
in VR. After removing redundant discoveries this resulted in a corpus of 39 publications that were 
fully  reviewed  to  identify  any  VR  applications  and  features  of  those  applications  intended  to 
support interaction between users. A total of 29 applications were discovered from this review. 
Nine  were  identified  as  publicly  or  commercially  available  applications  in  their  respective 
literature. The other 20 were research prototypes intended for private use.  

3.4  Review of Reference Lists 

The reference lists of the 39 publications discovered in step 1 were reviewed to identify additional 
literature. Two researchers collectively selected referenced literature for review if the title of the 
reference  or  content  connected  to  its  in-text  citation  suggested  that  the  source  may  contain 
information  about  VR  environments  designed  or  studied  in  their  capacity  to  facilitate  social 
interaction.  In  total,  78  cited  texts  were  selected  for  full  review.  Eleven  additional  social  VR 
applications  were  discovered;  2  commercially  available  applications  and  9  prototypical  or 
otherwise  non-publicly  available  applications.  This  review  also  reinforced  and  expanded  the 
team’s understanding of previously discovered social VR applications and design choices.  

3.5  Review of Reddit 

Reddit’s API was used to collect posts and associated metadata from several online communities 
(subreddits) related to social VR. A set of 13 public subreddits related to VR was compiled by using 
Reddit’s native subreddit search feature to search for subreddits based on the terms social VR, 
social virtual reality, virtual reality, virtual worlds, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Collaborative Virtual 
Environment. Two researchers familiar with Reddit then searched for the term social on each of 
the 13 subreddits, sorted the results by “Top posts of all time,” and inspected the title and content 
of the first 50 posts to identify social VR applications or design choices (a total of 650 posts were 
inspected  per  researcher).  Through  this  process  4  additional  social  VR  applications  were 
discovered, all of which were commercially available. Information that reinforced understanding 
of previously discovered social VR applications was also collected.

3.4  Autobiographical Landscape Research 

Autobiographical landscape research involves documentation of self-usage as a research tool for 
exploring design choices [51]. In our case this involved two researchers documenting their use of 
previously discovered social VR applications accessible on the Oculus Rift. The applications used 
were: AltspaceVR, Anyland, Facebook Spaces, High Fidelity, NeosVR, RecRoom, Sansar, VRChat, 
and Vtime.  An early version of the taxonomy was used to build a task-based checklist to examine 
design  choices  in  each  application.   This  checklist  had  three  sections:  user  representation, 
interaction, and the surrounding environment. Exploration of each social VR application involved 
two researchers: one using the application with an Oculus Rift headset (“the user”), and the other 
guiding  the  user  through  the  task-based  checklist  while  taking  field  notes  (the  social  VR 
environment was viewable to this researcher through a large external monitor). Review of the 
recordings and field notes led to identification of four new features and substantial refinement to 
how the taxonomy was organized. 

4  TAXONOMY OF SOCIAL VR DESIGN 

The social VR design taxonomy is organized into three design areas: 1) the self – how users are 
represented  within  the  virtual  environment;  2)  interaction  –  how  users  can  communicate  or 
exchange  information;  and  3)  the  environment  –  the  virtual  surroundings  in  which  users  are 
located. Each table is organized into three columns. The first column (left) represents the primary 
design area. The second column (middle) organizes feature categories pertinent to the =design 
area, and the third column (right) organizes individual design choices or variations within each 
category. Numbers next to each feature variation indicate the social VR applications that were 
discovered  to  include  the  design  choices.  The  absence  of  an  application  number  does  not 
necessarily mean the application is devoid of that feature variation, but rather that its existence 
within  was  not  identified  in  our  discovery  efforts.  Bold/underlined/italicized  numbers  refer  to 
non-commercial applications.

4.1  Taxonomy Section 1: The Self  

This  design  area  (table  2)  encapsulates  design  choices  enabling  users  to  present  themselves 
through  a  virtual  avatar  [59].  Four  categories  of  features  involving  the  self  were  discovered. 
Avatar representation refers to how much of a body, or how many body parts, a user’s avatar can 
depict in VR. Some social VR applications depict a full body (head, arms, torso, and legs), while 

. 

 
 
 
8 

Handley et al. 

some depict a partial body such as only a head (see OnLive Traveler [4]) or a head with torso. 
Three prototypical applications provide no avatar at all, with the user’s presence instead being 
conveyed through manipulation of objects. 

Avatar customization refers to the user’s ability to modify their avatar’s appearance. Several 
applications  provide  preset  avatar  choices,  meaning  users  can  select  from  a  variety  of  fully 
designed avatars. Appearance customization lets users modify individual parts of their avatar. In 
some cases users can upload their own content into their avatar design such as scans of their 
physical  world  appearance.  For  example,  the  prototypical  application  DIVE  from  the  1990s 
enabled users to upload a picture of their real face to their avatar’s head [7]. 

It  should  be  noted  that  preset  and  fully  customizable  avatars  do  not  have  to  reflect  a 
traditionally  human  form.  In  several  applications,  particularly  those  in  the  commercial  space, 
avatars can depict animals, mythical creatures, robots, and even traditionally inanimate objects 
(see  VRChat  [50,51]  or  High  Fidelity  [31,50–52]).  A  less  common  design  choice  for  avatar 
customization  is  no  customization  at  all,  meaning  users  are  assigned  a  non-modifiable  avatar. 
This was typically seen in prototypical applications. 

Social  VR  applications  also  vary  in  avatar  manipulation,  or  how  users  control  their  avatar. 
Some  use  full-body  tracking  cameras  and  hardware  so  that  the  user’s  physical  movement  is 
mimicked through their avatar. One unique variation comes from the prototypical application 
Diamond Park [74] in which users manipulate their avatar through pedaling a stationary bicycle. 
Others enable manipulation through handheld controllers, a computer mouse, or strictly hand 
tracking. A few prototypical applications offer little, if any, manipulation of one’s virtual body.  
Lastly, avatar locomotion refers to an avatar’s ability to travel through virtual space. Walking 
is the most common design choice, although newer commercial applications and one prototypical 
application  also  support  teleporting.  In  a  few  commercial  applications  and  one  prototypical 
application avatars can also fly, sometimes with the support of a plane, hovering boat, or other 
virtual vehicle. Social VR applications can also afford no avatar locomotion, meaning that users 
remain stationary in the virtual environment.

mouth and no eyes. Screenshots from “Stimulating my Friend's Phantom Touch in VRCHAT” by

4.2  Taxonomy Section 2: Interaction with Others  

This  design  area  involves  users  directly  interacting  with  one  another.  Three  categories  of 
interaction features were discovered. Communication types refer to how users communicate, or 
the types of content that they can exchange. Physical expression is the most common example in 
the taxonomy. This utilizes avatar manipulation for nonverbal communication through gestures 
and  bodily  movements.  Voice  communication  is  also  common  through  microphones  typically 
attached to VR headsets. Visemes refers to lip or mouth movement to provide avatar lip-sync for 
voice  communication.  A  less  common  communication  type  is  transactions,  referring  to  the 
transfer of currency or items between users. The rarest communication type in the taxonomy is 

 
 
 
 
 
 
A Taxonomy of Social VR Design

bio-adaptive feedback, exemplified only in the prototypical application DYNECOM VR [58] with 
visualization of brain activity and respiration rate.

(“Visemes” under Communication Types in the taxonomy). Screenshots from “NOT VRCHAT: REC ROOM”

Communication privileges are ways that users can control who is able to communicate with 
them.  Blocking and muting individual users from direct contact are common reactive features 
(they  can  be  employed  in  response  to  harassment  or  unwelcome  communication).  Other 
approaches include contact lists and invitations to interact in private virtual areas. A less common 
design choice, discovered only in commercial applications, is space control. This refers to a user’s 
ability to designate a space around their avatar that is inaccessible to other users or otherwise 
prevents  users  from  interacting  within  that  space.  For  example,  in  Rec  Room  avatars  will 
gradually disappear once they enter a user’s personal space. 

Several  social  VR  applications  also  scaffold  interaction  with  social  activities.  Some  of  these 
activities  revolve  around  collective  observation  or  discussion.  We  label  these  as  “events”  and 
examples include public viewings of videos or streams on virtual theater screens (see AltSpaceVR 
[31,50–53,61]), public forums with the application development team (see Sansar [70]), and public 
participation  in  a  theater  performance  (see  Holojam  in  Wonderland  [24]).  We  describe 
“recreation”  activities  as  those  that  users  actively  engage  in  together,  usually  through  ample 
avatar movement, such as dancing (see Virtual Dancing [65]), or minigames like paintball and 
charades (see Rec Room [50,51,53]).  

A  few  applications  were  also  found  to  support  collaborative  work.  These  examples  include 
prototyping  with  virtual  pen  and  paper  (see  PrototypingVR  [35]),  collaborative  floor  planning 
(see Embodied VR [63]), and collaborative review and modification of CAD models in General 
Motors’  Tele-Immersive  VisualEyes  [39].  Other  examples  reflected  a  teacher/student  dynamic 
with  collaborative  editing  of  virtual  whiteboards  (see  the  now-defunct  Facebook  Spaces 
[31,40,50,51])  and other learning artifacts like a virtual model of an ear for medical students (see 
Virtual Temporal Bone [39]). 

4.3  Taxonomy Section 3: The Environment 

This  design  area  encapsulates  design  choices  regarding  the  virtual  space  in  which  users  can 
interact and manipulate their avatars. Virtual environments can vary based on openness. Public 
environments allow any users to access the virtual space and freely interact. Public environments 
can be populated by several concurrent users who may or may not know each other, and can 
quickly become overwhelming if too many users are present.  By contrast, private environments 
are  accessible  only  to  predetermined  users  or  by  invitation  (see  Mozilla  VR    [34,50]).    All 
prototypical applications are listed under private environments because users could not freely 

. 

 
10 

Handley et al. 

access  the  virtual  environment  without  deliberate  action  on  behalf  of  the  researchers  or 
application developers. 

Spawning locations refer to where users enter virtual space when they access the social VR 
application. Some applications spawn users directly into, or on the periphery of, a social location 
accessible by other users. Other applications spawn users into private rooms accessible only to 
the individual to help them orient to VR before entering a public space (see Virtual Dancing [65]). 
In some cases these private spaces are designed to replicate familiar personal spaces, such as a 
bedroom in Rec Room [50,51,53]. Users may traverse back to their private room after interacting 
in public spaces to make modifications to their avatar or VR settings. Lastly, users accessing a 
social VR application for the first time may spawn into a tutorial, a variation of the private space 
designed to teach users the basics of the application. 

Several  applications  in  the  taxonomy  enable  users  to  manipulate  their  virtual  private  and 
public  environments.  Common  examples  involve  creating  and  altering  objects.  This  includes 
drawing  artifacts  in  the  virtual  space,  which  users  can  then  move  around  and  apply  to  their 
avatars as if they were objects (see Facebook Spaces [31,40,50,51]). Several applications also allow 
users to move or modify existing objects in the virtual space that they did not personally create 
(see PrototypingVR [35]). In some applications users can also create entirely new virtual spaces 
and  design  them  per  their  preferences  (see  Anyland  [50]).  Some  commercial  applications  like 
VRchat,  Rec  Room,  and  Sansar  offer  a  near  endless  array  of  manipulation  possibilities  for 
environment design that can result in rooms resembling physical world environments such as 
treehouses and parks, or distinctly fantastic environments like outer space landscapes. There are 
also  several  applications,  particularly  on  the  prototypical  side,  that  afford  no  manipulation  or 
alteration of the virtual environment.  

Fig. 1. Private spaces are sometimes designed only for individual users, and in the case of Rec Room can 
be designed to mimic physical world private places like a bedroom. Here users can modify their avatar 
and observe the changes (pictured), or simply relax before entering a social space. Screenshot from “NOT 
VRCHAT: REC ROOM” by NadditionVR, licensed under CC BY 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4rN0nnmmA 

5  LIMITATIONS 

It is possible that some social VR applications were not discoverable through our chosen review 
methods, and some could have also been missed due to human error. These limitations also apply 
to design choices within the discovered social VR applications, particularly those that were not 
personally accessible to the researchers. It is also possible, if not likely, that the state of social VR 
design has changed since we conducted our respective reviews. New social VR applications could 
have been created, existing ones could have had their designs updated, and new literature about 
social  VR  indicative  of  novel  design  choices  could  have  been  published,  which  would  not  be 
represented in the taxonomy.

5  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 

Documenting social VR design choices is important for informing future social VR applications 
and ideating solutions to emerging user problems.  Now more than ever, social VR is accessible 
to the masses because of affordable VR hardware like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive as well as an 
array of commercially available VR applications. It can be easy to forget that social VR prototypes 
and private applications have existed for decades before Rifts and Vives entered our homes, and 
no documentation of social VR design can really be complete without their inclusion.  

For  this  paper  we  constructed  a  taxonomy,  or  categorization,  of  social  VR  design  choices 
informed  by  44  social  VR  applications  across  commercial  and  non-commercial  domains.  This 
taxonomy extends efforts to document social VR design, which of recent have focused exclusively 
on commercially available social VR applications released in the last five or so years [36,50,51,66]. 
Aside from expanding the sheer number of applications incorporated into design documentation, 
the  taxonomy  visually  organizes  design  choices  in  a  way  that  is  rapidly  digestible  to  new 
researchers  and  designers.  One  anticipated  use  is  as  a  design  artifact  in  participatory  design 
sessions.  We  intend  the  taxonomy  to  provide  value  to  more  experienced  researchers  as  well 
through its capacity to be modified and grown. It could serve as an organizational tool to keep 
track of new features that are discovered or created as time progresses. Researchers can also use 
the taxonomy to map relevant literature to particular design choices, such as empirical studies of 
specific features (e.g., impact of avatar design choices on social presence), and identity features 
that are under-explored.
