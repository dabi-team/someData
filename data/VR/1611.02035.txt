We experimentally demonstrate collective strong coupling, optical bi-stability (OB) and all-optical switching in a 
system  consisting  of  ultracold  85Rb  atoms,  trapped  in  a  dark  magneto-optical  trap  (DMOT),  coupled  to  an  optical 
Fabry-Perot cavity. The strong coupling is established by measuring the vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) of a weak on-
axis  probe  beam.  The  dependence  of  VRS  on  the  probe  beam  power  is  measured  and  bi-stability  in  the  cavity 
transmission  is observed. We demonstrate control over the transmission of the probe beam through the atom-cavity 
system using a free-space off-axis control beam and show that the cavity transmission can be switched on and off in 
micro-second timescales using micro-Watt control powers. The utility of the system as a tool for sensitive, in-situ and 
rapid measurements is envisaged.

Systems with atoms  placed inside a cavity  have been a 
subject  of  study  for  many  decades [1–18].  Apart  from 
fundamental  physics [19],  the  motivation  for  studies  with 
optical  cavities  lies  in  a  large  variety  of  applications  in 
optical communication, quantum communication, quantum 
computing [20,21]  and,  as  we  suggest  here,  in  sensitive 
measurement  of  interactions.  Essential  requirements  for 
many  of 
these  applications  are  atom-cavity  strong 
coupling [9,11,12,14,21]  and  all-optical  switching  of  the 
cavity output light [7,10,22,23]. Perhaps the most important 
goal is to engineer all-optical switches that are fast, yet can 
be  operated  with  minimal  power [22–24].  To  this  end, 
significant progress has been made in cavity QED systems 
consisting  of  a  single  atom  strongly  coupled  to  a  high 
finesse  cavity [21],  which  however  require  extremely 
precise  system  control.  Here  we  study  the  relatively  less 
explored complementary system consisting of an ensemble 
of  trapped  ultracold  atoms  collectively  coupled  to  a  low 
finesse cavity [9–11]. This results in a significant technical 
simplification and ease with which a low intensity, fast all-
optical switch can be implemented. 

In  this  article,  we  show  that  atom-cavity  collective 
strong  coupling  can  be  achieved  on  a  non-cycling  (i.e. 
open) transition in a continuously operated  85Rb dark-spot 
magneto-optical  trap  (DMOT) [25,26].  The  signature  of 
collective strong coupling is vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) 
which is observed using a weak on-axis  probe beam.  The 
dependence of VRS on the probe beam power is measured 
and  optical  bi-stability  (OB)  in  the  cavity  transmission  is 
observed. Control over the nature of OB curve using a free-
space  off-axis  control  beam  is  demonstrated.  We  finally 
show that the cavity  transmission can be switched on and 
off  in  micro-second  timescales  using  micro-Watt  control 
powers. Remarkably, a DMOT of  ultracold atoms coupled 
to  a  cavity  can  be  operated  analogous  to  both  strongly 
coupled  atom-cavity  systems  as  well  as  weakly  coupled 
vapor  cell  based  cavity  systems,  and  retain  advantages  of 
the respective systems. 

The details of the overall experimental apparatus which 
consists of an atom trap and an ion trap at the mode center 
of  a  low  finesse  optical  cavity  has  been  described 
elsewhere [11,27].  A  schematic  representation  of  parts 
relevant for the present experiments is shown in Fig. 1(a). 
The 85Rb DMOT is loaded from a Rb dispenser source. The 
DMOT  is  formed  by  three  mutually  orthogonal  pairs  of 
counter-propagating  cooling  beams  and  two  mutually 
orthogonal repumping beams. The  magnetic  field gradient 
for  the  DMOT  is  ~22  Gauss/cm.  The  cooling  and 
repumping  lights  are  derived  from  two  separate  external 
cavity  diode  lasers  (ECDLs).  The  cooling  (repumping) 
beams are detuned by -12 MHz (+20 MHz) from the F = 3 
→ F′ = 4 (F = 2 → F′ = 3) atomic transition, are each 1 cm 
in diameter and each have 7 mW (2.2 mW) optical power. 
The repumping beams have their centers darkened with an 
opaque disc of 2 mm diameter such that no repumping light 
is  present  where  ultracold  atoms  remain  trapped  –  this 
pumps  >95%  of  the  ultracold  85Rb  atoms  to  the  ground 
non-fluorescing    F = 2 state.  The low fluorescence of  the 
trapped atoms minimizes the otherwise deleterious effect of 
the  fluorescent  photons  being  coupled  to  the  cavity.  We 
measure  the  number  of  ultracold  atoms  in  the  DMOT  by 
instantaneously  turning  it  to  a  bright  MOT  using  a 
repumping light tuned to the F = 2 → F′ = 3 transition and 
recording  the  fluorescence  on  a  calibrated  photomultiplier 
tube (PMT). We typically have ~106 atoms in the DMOT at 
a density of ~1010 cm-3.  

The  DMOT  is  positioned  at  the  center  of  the  Fabry-
Perot  cavity  by  monitoring  (on  a  CCD  camera)  the 
fluorescence (of a bright MOT) that is out-coupled though 
the cavity (see Fig. 1(a)). The cavity consists of a pair of 
curved mirrors (radius of curvature 50 mm) separated by  L 
= 45.7 mm. The cavity waist for the TEM00 mode is 78 μm 
and the finesse is measured to be ~ 650. One of the cavity 
mirrors  is  mounted  on  a  piezoelectric  stack  that  allows 
tuning  the  cavity  length  by  a  few  μm.  The  length  of  the 
cavity is adjusted to be resonant with  the  F = 2 →  F′  = 3 
atomic transition (whose frequency is denoted by       ).

In our experiments, we keep the cavity tuned to the F  = 
2  →  F′  =  3  atomic  transition  and  the  ultracold  atoms  are 
trapped in the F = 2 state. The probe beam is derived from

measured using a saturated absorption spectroscopy (SAS) 
set  up.  The  probe  power  is  controlled  using  an  acousto-
optic  modulator  (AOM)  in  double-pass  configuration.  For 
the VRS measurements, the probe beam is coupled into the 
cavity and its frequency is scanned across the F = 2 → F′ = 
3 transition while its transmission is monitored on a PMT. 
With a weak probe beam (Pi ~ 4 μW) we observe two VRS 
peaks separated in frequency by     (≈ 41 ± 1 MHz) in the 
cavity transmission (Fig. 2). This establishes that system is 
in the collective strong coupling regime.  

the 

model [28], 

In  the  weak  probe  regime,  i.e.  low  excitation  regime, 
the atom-cavity system behaves like two coupled harmonic 
oscillators whose degeneracy is lifted by  the coupling and 
the  system  can  described  by  the  extension  of  the  Jaynes-
Travis-Cummings 
Cummings 
Hamiltonian [29].  On  increasing  the  probe  power,  atomic 
saturation effects come into play since the atom is a two-
level  system  as  opposed  to  a  harmonic  oscillator  with 
infinite numbers of equally spaced energy levels and so the 
simple  description  of  coupled  harmonic  oscillators  is  not 
strictly  valid [21,30,31].  The  other  parameter,  apart  from 
  , that determines the behavior of the atom-cavity syste m 
is  the  power  of  the  probe  beam  with  respect  to  the 
 ≈ 
saturation 
48430   [31], where    = 2   = 1/τ, b = 8/3 for a Gaussian 
standing wave and  τ = 26.235 ns is the radiative lifetime of 
excited  state.  This  value  of     corresponds  to  around  60 
nW of intra-cavity probe power. We study the dependence 
of VRS on probe power as shown in Fig. 2.

The  atom-cavity  system  is  probed  with  an  on-axis  probe 
the 
beam  whose 
transmission monitored on a PMT. Only a small fraction of 
the incident probe power (Pi) is coupled into the cavity due 
to imperfect  mode-matching between  the  probe beam and 
the cavity mode (the cavity transmitivity is ~10-5 of Pi). In 
what  follows,  we  measure  and  present  the  incident  probe 
power (Pi), and not the power coupled into the cavity. The 
control beam that we use to alter the atom-cavity coupling 
is incident along a direction perpendicular to the cavity axis 
(Fig.  1(a)).  The  frequency         of  the  control  beam  is 
detuned by -18 MHz from       , the frequency of the F 
= 3 → F′ = 3 transition. The energy level diagram with all 
relevant frequencies is depicted in Fig. 1(b). The DMOT is 
operated  continuously,  i.e.  cooling  beams,  repumping 
beams and the  magnetic field are always on, which allows 
measurements to be performed continuously.

The interaction between a two-level atom (here, the F = 
2  and  F′  =  3  levels  of  85Rb)  with  a  single  mode  of  the 
electromagnetic field within a cavity leads to an alteration 
of  the  transmission  though  the  cavity.  The  single  atom-
cavity 
determines  the  strength  of  the  coupling,  where  μ23  is  the 
transition dipole moment for the F = 2 → F′ = 3 transition, 
    is  the  permittivity  of  free  space  and  Vc  is  the  cavity 
mode volume. For our cavity parameters     0.1 MHz and 
a  single  atom  cannot  couple  strongly  to  the  cavity  since 
     (    ),  where   is  the  spontaneous  decay  rate  of  the 
excited atomic state and   is the photon  loss rate from the 
cavity. However, the presence of Nc atoms overlapped with 
the  cavity  mode  increases  the  effective  coupling 
to 
      √    and  the  collective  strong  coupling  between 
atoms and cavity, defined by      (    ), is attained when 
Nc  exceeds  a  critical  number  (~104  in  our  case).  We 
typically operate our experiment such that    ~ 105.  

 
 
 
            
 
 
With  increasing  probe  power,  the  excitation  increases 
and  so  does  the  anharmonicity.  Two  well  separated 
vacuum-Rabi  peaks  come  closer  with  increasing  probe 
power and eventually merge into a single peak [30,31]. The 
peaks  themselves  are  asymmetric  due  to  an  underlying 
optical bi-stability (see below). The single peak structure at 
high intensity approaches that of an empty cavity and stems 
from  the  F  =  2  →  F′  =  3  transition  being  saturated  (i.e. 
leaving fewer atoms in the  F = 2 level) and thus no longer 
affecting  the  cavity  transmission  significantly.  In  order  to 
gain  additional  insight  we  look  at  the  transmitted  power 
(Pt)  vs.  the  incident  power  (Pi)  curve  of  the  composite 
system, traditionally called the OB curve [8].  

For the OB curve measurement, we lock the probe laser 
on  the  F = 2 →  F′ = 3 transition and  then scan  the  probe 
power up and down using the AOM. The result is shown in 
the 
Fig.  3  (filled  circles).  During 
the  upward-scan 
transmitted  power  (Pt)  increases  until  Pi,u  and 
then 
suddenly  jumps  to  a  high  value,  post  which  Pt  again 
increases with Pi. On reversing the scan, i.e. reducing Pi, Pt 
decreases  along  a  different  route  from  the  upward-scan 
until  Pi,d  (<  Pi,u)  when  it  suddenly  jumps  to  a  very  small 
value.  On  further  reduction  of  Pi,  Pt  retraces  the  upward-
scan values. The strongly coupled atom-cavity system thus 
shows OB and hysteresis much like vapor-cell based atom-
cavity  system  in  the  weak  coupling  regime [32,33].  It  is 
interesting to  note that at input power  Pi,u, the transmitted 
power  Pt  has  three  values.  This  could  be  due  to  an 
underlying  optical  multi-stability [8]  or  due  to  slight 
(uncontrolled) detuning of the cavity from the F = 2 → F′ = 
3  transition.  The  behavior  of  OB  and  the  hysteresis  loop 
can  be  controlled  by  detuning  the  cavity  from  the  atomic 
resonance [34–36] which is not discussed further here. 

In  order  to  explore  the  control  of  the  OB  in  the  two-
level  system  discussed  above,  we  extend  the  scope  by 
involving a third level,  F = 3. The  F = 2 and  F = 3 levels 
are separated by 3.035 GHz and direct transitions between 
these levels may be ignored. The dipole allowed transitions 
F = 2 ↔  F′  = 3 and  F = 3 ↔  F′  = 3 form a Λ-type three 
level system. As in the earlier measurement, the probe laser 
is locked to the F = 2 → F′ = 3 transition and the additional 
laser, called the control laser, addresses the F = 3 ↔ F′ = 3 
transition.  The  control  laser  is  derived  by  frequency 
shifting  a  part  of  the  cooling  laser  beam  using  an  AOM. 
The same AOM is also used to switch the control beam on 
and  off.  The  control  beam  frequency  is  -18  MHz  (red) 
detuned  from the  F = 3 and  F′ = 3 transition and its beam 
diameter  is  ~  1  mm.  This  detuning  of  the  control  laser  is 
chosen so that it is resonantly couples the F = 3 level with 
the lower frequency vacuum-Rabi peak  that appears ~  -20 
MHz (red) detuned  from the  F′ = 3 level (It was checked, 
however,  by  tuning  to  ~  +28  MHz  that  the  frequency  of 
control  beam  is  not  very  critical  for  switching).  We  scan 
the  probe  power  and  measure  the  OB  curve  for  different 
powers of the control beam (Fig. 3).  

The  hysteresis loop shifts towards higher input powers 

with increasing control beam power Pc. The effect can be

understood as follows. In absence of the control beam, the 
input  probe  power  at  which  the  transmission  suddenly 
jumps  to  a  high  value  is  a  measure  of  the  probe  power 
where saturation of the  F = 2 ↔  F′ = 3 transition  strongly 
affects  the  atom-cavity  system.  In  presence  of  the  control 
beam, a fraction of the atomic population  that had decayed 
to  the  F  =  3  level  is  brought  back  to  the  F  =  2  level  via 
control  beam  absorption 
spontaneous 
emission. This increases the population in the F = 2 relative 
to the no-control beam case and an increased probe power 
is required for saturation of  the  F  = 2 ↔  F′ = 3  transition 
which  results  in  shifting  of  the  hysteresis  loop  towards 
higher  input  probe  power.  Another  major  difference  from 
the no-control beam case is that during the upward-scan the 
transmitted power  Pt stays almost at  zero  until the sudden 
jump. We exploit these features to implement an all-optical 
switch,  at  low  input  probe  power  (~  2.4  μW),  described 
below.  As  is  evident  from  Fig.  3,  switching  can  also  be 
implemented for high input power (> 90 μW). We note that 
the  input-output  behavior  can  be  controlled  by  tuning  the 
cavity  detuning,  probe  detuning  and  control  beam 
detuning  [35], which is not discussed further here. 

Before  demonstrating  all-optical  switching  we  check 
the  VRS  in  presence  of  the  control  beam.  For  this,  the 
experimental protocol for Fig. 2 is repeated in absence and 
in presence of the control beam. The dotted line in Fig. 4(a) 
shows  the  experimentally  observed  VRS  (with  Pi  ~  2.4 
μW) when the control beam is blocked, while the solid line 
in Fig. 4(a) shows the case when a  control beam with 9.5 
μW optical power is also present. Clearly, the vacuum-Rabi 
peaks  disappear  in  presence  of  the  control  beam.  This 
behavior  is  qualitatively  different  from  that  reported  by 
Wei et al.  [10] who observed suppression of cavity output 
in a  narrow frequency range (~ 5 MHz) within one of  the 
vacuum-Rabi  peaks.  As  discussed  in  their  paper,  the 
optical-switching time observed was fundamentally limited

required for the output to drop to     of the initial value, is 
12.5±1.0 µs, 17.4±2.3 µs and 28.0±2.2 µs for Pc = 9.5 µW, 
6.1  µW  and  3.1  µW,  respectively.  We  see  that  the  cavity 
output  can  be  switched  on  and  off  in  micro-second  time 
scales using  micro-Watt power levels, i.e. with ~100 pico-
Joule of energy. It is expected that the switching times can 
be reduced by increasing  the  control power but increasing 
the  control  power  beyond  20  μW  adversely  affects  the 
operation of the DMOT in the current setup. 

The  relatively  simple  experimental  set-up  using  a 
DMOT  combines  the  advantages/abilities  of  simple  vapor 
cell based  atom-cavity systems with those of sophisticated 
cavity experiments using single atoms. The DMOT holds a 
steady number of atoms with negligible velocities, prepared 
in  a  specific  quantum  state  –  this  mimics  a  vapor  cell 
except  that complications from thermal  motion and  mixed 
quantum  states  are  minimized.  This  allows  continuous 
measurements and rapid all-optical switching in a different 
regime, e.g. compared  to Sharma  et al. [32]. At low input 
probe power, the system is in the collective strong-coupling 
regime. As the input  probe power is increased, the system 
makes  a  transition  to  the  weak  coupling  regime  –  this 
allows  flexibility  in  the  operation  of  a  switch.  Further 
manipulation is possible by an off-axis control beam which 
allows  control  over cavity  transmission  in  different  probe 
power  regimes  and  enables  rapid  all-optical  switching. 
Apart  from  the  conventional  applications  as  an  all-optical 
switch, the possible application of this highly versatile and 
nonlinear system would be as a very sensitive tool for  the 
measurement  of  perturbations/interactions,  under  carefully 
controlled  conditions  near  the  bi-stable  region  of  the 
system. 

In  conclusion,  we  demonstrate 

that  continuous 
measurements  of  a  strongly  coupled  atom-cavity  system, 
made  possible  through  a  DMOT,  results  in  a  simple  yet 
powerful system for cavity QED experiments. We observe 
OB of the two-level system whose behavior we can control 
by  optical  coupling  to  a  third  level.  Finally,  we  show  all-
optical  switching  of  cavity  transmission  in  micro-second 
timescales  with  only  micro-Watt  powers.  Future 
experimental  directions  include  lowering  the  switching 
time and the required switching power, and also studies on 
detuned  atom-cavity  systems.  The  rapid  measurement 
demonstrated here also enables the possibility of rapid and 
non-destructive detection of two-particle interactions [37].

disappearance  of  VRS  peaks  that  we  observe  is  not

allows  us  to  perform  robust  all-optical  switching  of  the 
cavity output. We also note that the control power required 
in our experiment is many orders of magnitude lower than 
in vapor cell based experiments [7]. An efficient all-optical 
switch  should  be  fast  and  operate  with  minimal  power, 
which we demonstrate as follows.  

The  frequency  of  the  probe  laser  is  stabilized  at  -18 
MHz (red) detuned from the F = 2 ↔ F′ = 3 transition. This 
detuning  of  the  probe  laser  is  chosen  because  the  lower 
frequency vacuum-Rabi peak has maximum transmission at 
this  detuning  of  the  probe  laser.  Figure  4(b)  shows  the 
cavity output power when the control beam is switched on 
and off  using an AOM.  When  the  control beam is off, the 
cavity  output  power  is  high  and  steady.  On  turning  the 
control beam on,  the cavity output power drops almost  to 
zero.  The  switching  off  time       ,  defined  as  the  time
