Abstract – The space-time focusing of a (continuous) succession of localized X-shaped

pulses is obtained by suitably integrating over their speed, i.e., over their axicon angle,

thus generalizing a previous (discrete) approach. First, new Superluminal wave pulses

are constructed, and then tailored in such a wave to get them temporally focused at a

chosen spatial point, where the waveﬁeld can reach for a short time very high intensities.

Results of this kind may ﬁnd applications in many ﬁelds, besides electromagnetism and

optics, including acoustics, gravitation, and elementary particle physics.

1. – Introduction

For many years it has been known that localized (non-diﬀractive) solutions exist

to the wave equation[1]. Some localized wave solutions have peaks that travel at the

speed of light, while others are endowed with subluminal or Superluminal velocities[2]. In

more recent years, particular attention has been paid to the Superluminal[3-7] Localized

Waves (SLW), that can have several applications such as high resolution imaging[8], secure

communications, non-diﬀractive pulse propagation in material media[9-11], identiﬁcation

of buried objects[12], and so on.

The most characteristic SLWs

resulted to be the so-called X-shaped solu-

tions[13,3,4,6,14] (also named X-waves, in brief) whose structure and behavior are by

now well understood, and experimentally reproduced[15-18]. Even their propagation

along waveguides has been investigated[19].

In addition, their ﬁnite energy versions,

with arbitrary frequencies and adjustable bandwidths[6,10,20], have been also constructed.

Moreover, several investigations about constructing and generating approximate X-shaped

waves from ﬁnite apertures[21,22] have been carried on.

In a recent paper by Shaarawi et al.[23], appeared in this Journal, it has been intro-

duced a space-time focusing technique (called “Temporal focusing”), that had recourse to

superpositions of localized X-waves traveling with diﬀerent velocities. The various pulses

were designed to reach a given spatial point z = zf at the same time t = tf .

In the

mentioned work[23], the resulting composite X-shaped wave was synthesized as a discrete

sum of individual X-waves.

In the present paper we generalize that focusing scheme,

by going on, in particular, to a continuous superposition of individual X-waves, i.e., to

integrals (instead of discrete sums). We are moreover going to show how one can in gen-

eral use any known Superluminal solution, to obtain from it a large number of analytic

expressions for space-time focused waves, endowed with a very strong intensity peak at

3

the desired location. Finally, we shall consider the case of the excitation of such pulses

from ﬁnite-size apertures. At variance with the source-free case, the range over which

the aperture-generated pulses can be focused is limited by the ﬁeld depth of the single

X-wave components.

2. – The Discrete Space-time Focusing Method

Let us ﬁrst summarize the “temporal focusing” scheme developed in Ref.[23]. Since

the velocity of the X-shaped waves depends on their apex angle θ (also known as the axicon

angle), in the previous paper the space-time focusing was achieved by superimposing a

discrete number of X-waves, characterized by diﬀerent θ values. In this work, we’ll go on to

more eﬃcient superpositions for varying velocities V , related to θ through the known[3,4]

relation V = c/ cos θ. It will be shown in Section 3 that this enhanced focusing scheme

has the advantage of yielding analytic (closed-form) expressions for the spatio-temporally

focused pulses.

Consider an axially symmetric Superluminal∗ wave pulse ψ(ρ, z

V t) in a dispersion-

−

less media, where V > c is the pulse velocity and (ρ, φ, z) are the cylindrical co-ordinates.

Pulses like these can be obtained by a superposition of Bessel beams[3,4,24], viz.,

as well as their ﬁnite energy version, can be found in Refs.[20,6].

the given point, z = zf, at the same time t = tf . On choosing t1 = 0 for the slowest pulse

where An are constants, will represent a set of N (initially separated) Superluminal waves,

which just reach the position z = zf at the same time t = tf = zf /V1.

The scheme described above was essentially developed in Ref.[23] by using discrete

X-waves: We have just replaced summations over θ with summations over V .

In the

remaining part of this work, we propose a generalization of that idea, which can yield

new classes of exact Superluminal solutions, besides providing enhanced focusing eﬀects.

2.1 – The new space-time focusing scheme

In this Section, we extend the previous “temporal focusing” approach[23] by consid-

ering a continuous superposition, namely, by integrating over the velocity (instead of a

discrete sum over the angle θ).

Combining Eqs.(4) and (5), and going on to the integration over V , one gets

(6)

where V is the velocity of the wave ψ in Eq.(1). In the integration, V is considered as a

continuous variable in the interval [Vmin, Vmax]. In Eq.(6), A(V ) is the velocity-distribution

function that speciﬁes the contribution of each wave component (with velocity V ) to the

integration. The resulting wave Ψ(ρ, z, t) can have a more or less strong amplitude peak

at z = zf , at time tf = zf /Vmin, depending on A(V ) and on the diﬀerence Vmax −
us notice that also the resulting waveﬁeld will propagate with a Superluminal velocity,

Vmin. Let

(7)

In the cases when the velocity-distribution function is well concentrated around a

certain velocity value, one can expect the wave (6) to increase its magnitude and spatial

localization while propagating. Finally, the pulse peak acquires its maximum amplitude

and localization (at the chosen point z = zf , and at time t = zf/Vmin, as we know).

Afterwards, the wave suﬀers a progressive spreading, and a decreasing of its amplitude.

The “classical” solution (8) can be obtained[3,6,4] by substituting the spectrum S(ω) =

Ω(ω) exp(

a ω) into Eq.(1), where a is a constant that deﬁnes the bandwidth, ∆ω = 1/a,

−

and Ω(ω) is the step-function.§ When using the zeroth-order X-waves above, however,

the largest spectral amplitudes are obtained for low frequencies. For this reason, one

may expect that the solutions considered below will be suitable mainly for low frequency

applications.

3.1 – Some examples

In what follows, we illustrate the behavior of our new spatio-temporally focused pulses,

by taking into consideration four diﬀerent velocity distributions A(V ).

First case:

Let us consider our “integral solution” (10) with

A(V ) = 1 .

(12)

In this case, the contribution of the X-waves is the same for all velocities in the allowed

range [Vmin, Vmax], and Eq.(10) yields

where P , Q and R are given in Eq.(11). A 3-dimensional (3-D) plot of this function is

provided in Fig.1; where we have chosen a = 10−12 s, Vmin = 1.001 c, Vmax = 1.005 c

8

and zf = 200 cm. It can be seen that this solution exhibits a rather evident space-time

focusing. An initially spread-out pulse (shown for t = 0) becomes highly localized at

t = tf = zf /Vmin = 6.66 ns, the pulse peak amplitude at zf being 40.82 times greater than

the initial one. In addition, at the focusing time tf the ﬁeld is much more localized than

at any other times. The velocity of this pulse is approximately V = 1.003 c.

– Enhanced Space-time Focusing by Using Higher-Order X-Waves of

Arbitrary Frequencies and Adjustable Bandwidths

The scheme presented in the preceding Section (conﬁned to zeroth-order X-waves) can

be extended to higher-order X-waves. Namely, one can use in the integrand of Eq.(6) the

various time-derivatives of the ordinary X-waves, which have been shown[26] to consti-

tute an inﬁnite set of generalized X-wave solutions. This procedure will provide us with

spatio-temporally focused Superluminal pulses that can have any arbitrary frequencies

and adjustable bandwidths[6,10]. It has been also shown[26,7,10,6] that time derivatives

of the X-waves can be constructed by substituting into Eq.(1) the frequency spectrum

S(ω) = Ω(ω) ωm exp(

a ω), with m an integer. A more general approach for obtaining in-

−

ﬁnite series of X-shaped solutions through suitable diﬀerentiations of the ordinary X-wave

can be found in Ref.[6]; whilst more details about the properties of the frequency-spectra,

which allows for closed-form solutions, can be found in the mentioned Refs.[10,7,6].

11

Namely: by using appropriate values for the parameters m and a, it is possible to shift

the central frequency, ωc, and adjust the bandwidth, ∆ω, to any desired values[6,7,10].

The relationships among ωc, ∆ω, a and m are

where[7,10] ∆ω+ (> 0) is the bandwidth to the right, and ∆ω− (> 0) is the bandwidth

to the left of ωc; so that ∆ω = ∆ω+ + ∆ω−.

using m = 1, a = 10−12 s, Vmin = 1.001 c, Vmax = 1.005 c, and zf = 200 cm, the peak

amplitude at z = zf results to be 1000 times larger than the initial one, while, at the

focusing time tf = 6.66ns the ﬁeld is much more localized than at any other times. The

velocity of this pulse is approximately V = 1.0029 c.

5. – A More General Formulation

The results presented in the preceding Sections demonstrate that in Eq.(6) one can

utilize any kind of Superluminal pulses towards the goal of producing large space-time

focusing eﬀects. A further generalization of our focusing scheme is introduced in the

present Section.

Let us recall that a Superluminal wave with axial symmetry can be rewritten[6] as a

superposition of Bessel beams expressed in terms of V (instead of θ):

are able to produce spatio-temporally focused pulses that propagate, once more, at Su-

dowed with velocity V and angular frequency ω, possesses also a diﬀerent phase with

plitudes of each Bessel beam in the superposition, but also the relative phases among

them. Along similar lines, Mugnai et al.[27] demonstrated that one can generate beams

with a very hight optical resolving power by a superposition of Bessel beams with suitably

chosen relative phase-delays. This was achieved by the use of a paraﬃn torus in each one

of the coronae adopted for producing the various Bessel beams, the required phase delays

being determined by the paraﬃn.

In a sense, the superpositions introduced in this work

appear to reveal that an analogous phenomenon holds in the case of pulses too.

sented in Section 5 can be actually regarded as a powerful tool, that may be used to tailor

an initially spread pulse, with the aim of focusing it at a pre-chosen point in space-time.

The situation becomes more involved, however, when such a tailored pulse is generated

from an aperture having a ﬁnite radius: In fact, the X-wave components having diﬀerent

velocities are characterized by diﬀerent diﬀraction-free lengths (or “ﬁeld depths”). More

speciﬁcally, zd = D/(2

(V /c)2

To appreciate the eﬀect of the ﬁnite size of the aperture on the space-time focusing

scheme, we calculate the ﬁeld radiated by a ﬁnite aperture using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld

between source and observation points. Assuming the initial excitation to be that of

q

Eq.(14), we have calculated the radiated ﬁeld for the parameters a = 10−12 s, Vmin =

1.001 c and Vmax = 1.005 c. The aperture radius has been chosen to equal 20 cm. For

these parameter values, the diﬀraction-free lengths associated with the chosen values of

Vmin and Vmax are 447.1 and 199.75 cm, respectively. The crucial factor that determines

the focusing power of the tailored pulses is the focusing distance zf. Unlike the source-

free case, the focusing distance is inﬂuenced by the ﬁnite size of the aperture. For the

17

chosen parameters, all X-wave components undergo very little decay over distances z <

199.75 cm. By contrast, most of the X-wave components will be decaying at a very fast

rate for z > 447.1 cm. In the intermediate range 199.75 < z < 447.1 cm, an increasing

portion of the components will decay as the distance from the source increases.

To illustrate the behavior described above, we provide plots of the axial proﬁles of
2 for zf = 200 and 300 cm. The ﬁrst focusing point is chosen

at the edge of the diﬀraction-free region, while the second is chosen in the middle of the

intermediate region. The plots displayed in Figs.3 and 4 depict the behavior of the pulse

radiated from a ﬁnite-size aperture for zf = 200 cm. The 3-D surface plots in Figs.3 show

the shape of the initial excitation on the aperture plane z′ = 0, and the shape of the

source-free pulse at the focusing point z = zf = 200 cm. In Figs.4, we provide plots of the

axial proﬁles of the ﬁeld radiated from the ﬁnite aperture at distances z = 50, 150, 200

and 250 cm, respectively. One should notice that the focusing amplitude is comparable to

that of the focused source-free pulse at z = zf . The 3-D plot of the focused pulse radiated

from the aperture is therefore expected to be similar to the one shown in Fig.3b for the

source-free pulse. The plots in Figs.3 and 4 show, furthermore, that the peak power of the

pulse is ampliﬁed by 40 times. The fact that at z = 200 cm the pulse radiated from the

aperture resembles the source-free pulse is a conﬁrmation of our qualitative prediction

that, for distances z < 199.75 cm, all X-wave components contributing to the initial

excitation of the source are diﬀraction-free.

As a second example, we have chosen zf = 300 cm. Keeping all other parameters equal

to the ones used for Figs.3 and 4, we ﬁnd that the peak power of the aperture-radiated

pulse at the focusing point is lower than that of the source-free pulse. The 3-D plots in

Figs.5 show the source free pulse at the aperture plane and at z = zf = 300 cm. The axial

proﬁle of the pulse generated from the ﬁnite aperture is shown in Figs.6 for z = 75, 225,

285 and 375 cm, respectively. The peak at z = zf = 300 cm is not shown because the

18

peak focusing occurs, instead, at z = 285 cm. This is another manifestation of the fact

that contributions from certain X-wave components, constituting the initial excitation,

are lost, because such components have surpassed their diﬀraction-free range. Another

conﬁrmation of this behavior is that the peak power is ampliﬁed 10 times only, instead of

the 75 times expected for the source-free pulse.

Although the inﬂuence of the size of the aperture has been demonstrated only for the

pulse given in Eq.(14), nevertheless one can easily extend the same analysis to spatio-

temporally focused pulses of other types [cf. Eqs.(17),(20),(23)].

7. – Conclusions

In conclusion, by a generalization of the discrete “Temporal Focusing” method[23],

we have found new classes of Superluminal waves. These new closed-form wave solutions

show great potential for space-time focusing. Indeed, we can tailor initially spread-out

pulses, so much so that they are strongly focused at a point chosen a priori in space-time.

In this work we have demonstrated that these tailored pulses are easily adjustable by

varying the velocity spectra of their Superluminal wave components.

We have also investigated the inﬂuence of having such pulses launched from a ﬁnite-

size aperture. It has been shown that, because the individual Superluminal wave compo-

nents, from which the focusing pulse is synthesized, have aperture-dependent diﬀraction-

free lengths, the size of the aperture aﬀects the focusing position and magnitude. The

described method is very eﬀective where all Superluminal wave components are propa-

gating within their diﬀraction-free range.

Fig.1 – Space-time evolution of the Superluminal pulse represented by Eq.(14); the pa-

rameter chosen values are a = 10−12 s; Vmin = 1.001 c; Vmax = 1.005 c while the

focusing point is at zf = 200 cm. One can see that this solution is associated with

a rather good spatio-temporal focusing. The ﬁeld amplitude at z = zf is 40.82 times

larger than the initial one. The ﬁeld amplitude is normalized at the space-time point

ρ = 0, z = zf, t = tf.

Fig.2 – Space-time evolution of the Superluminal pulse represented by Eq.(32). Now

the parameters have the values m = 1, a = 10−12 s (and therefore ωc = 1 GHz);

Vmin = 1.001 c; Vmax = 1.005 c); while the focussing point is again at zf = 200 cm. Also

this solution is associated with a very good spatio-temporal focusing: The ﬁeld amplitude

at z = zf is 1000 times higher than the initial one. Once more, the ﬁeld amplitude is

normalized at the space-time point ρ = 0, z = zf , t = tf .
