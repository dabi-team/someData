Abstract— In this letter, we study optimal multicast of tiled
360 virtual reality (VR) video from one server (base station or
access point) to multiple users. We consider random viewing
directions and random channel conditions, and adopt
time
division multiple access (TDMA). For given video quality, we
optimize the transmission time and power allocation to minimize
the average transmission energy. For given transmission energy
budget, we optimize the transmission time and power allocation
as well as the encoding rate of each tile to maximize the received
video quality. These two optimization problems are challenging
non-convex problems. We obtain globally optimal closed-form
solutions of the two non-convex problems, which reveal important
design insights for multicast of tiled 360 VR video. Finally,
numerical results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed
solutions.

I. INTRODUCTION

is predicted that

A virtual reality (VR) video is generated by capturing a
scene of interest from all directions at the same time using
omnidirectional cameras. A user wearing a VR headset can
freely watch the scene of interest in any viewing direction at
any time, hence enjoying immersive viewing experience. VR
has vast applications in entertainment, education, medicine,
the global market of VR related
etc. It
products will reach 30 billion US dollars by 2020
[1].
Transmitting an entire 360 VR video which is of a much
larger size than a traditional video brings a heavy burden
to wireless networks. To improve transmission efﬁciency and
avoid view switch delay, a 360 VR video is divided into
smaller rectangular segments of the same size, referred to as
tiles. The set of tiles covering a user’s current ﬁeld-of-view
(FoV) and the FoVs that may be watched shortly should be
transmitted simultaneously.

In [2], [3], the authors consider tiled 360 VR video trans-
mission in single-user wireless networks, and optimize video
encoding parameters to maximize the utility which reﬂects the
quality of the received 360 VR video. The optimization prob-
lems are discrete, and are solved by exhaustive search. In [4],
[5], the authors consider 360 VR video transmission in multi-
user wireless networks, and exploit multicast opportunities for

serving concurrent viewers to improve transmission efﬁciency.
In particular, [4] adopts the tiling technique, and optimizes
the modulation and coding level of each tile to maximize the
video quality. It is a discrete optimization problem of a large
size, and the proposed heuristic algorithm may not provide
desirable performance and complexity. Different from [2]–[4],
[5] considers online encoding to encode only the required area
to be transmitted. In addition, [5] proposes a dynamic multicast
mechanism which is adaptive to the channel conditions of all
users. The online encoding in [5] has higher coding efﬁciency
(at the cost of the increase of implementation complexity).
However, the transmission scheme in [5] is not optimization
based, and may not guarantee promising performance. Note
that the solutions in [4], [5] do not provide many design
insights for 360 VR video multicast in wireless networks. It is
still not known how the required FoVs and channel conditions
of all users affect optimal resource allocation.

In this letter, we would like to address the above issues.
We consider optimal multicast of tiled 360 VR video from
one server (base station or access point) to multiple users.
Speciﬁcally, we divide the 360 VR video into tiles. For each
user, we deliver a set of tiles that cover the user’s current
FoV and the FoVs that may be watched shortly. In order
to make use of multicast opportunities and avoid redundant
transmissions, we partition the set of tiles to be transmitted
to users into disjoint subsets and multicast different subsets of
tiles to different groups of users. We consider random viewing
directions and random channel conditions, and adopt time
division multiple access (TDMA). For given video quality, we
optimize the transmission time and power allocation to mini-
mize the average transmission energy under the transmission
time allocation constraints and the transmission rate constraint.
For given transmission energy budget, we optimize the trans-
mission time and power allocation as well as the encoding rate
of each tile to maximize the received video quality under the
maximum transmission energy constraint. These two optimiza-
tion problems are challenging non-convex problems. For each
non-convex optimization problem, by analyzing optimality
properties, we successfully transform it into an equivalent
convex problem and obtain a globally optimal closed-form
solution using KKT conditions. The derived solutions reveal
important design insights for multicast of tiled 360 VR video.
To the best of our knowledge, these important design insights
have never been explicitly explored and analytically veriﬁed in
existing literature. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the
advantage of the proposed optimal solutions.

station or access point) to K (≥ 1) single-antenna users.
Let K , {1, . . . , K} denote the set of user indices. For
ease of implementation, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider
Nh × Nv viewing directions, where Nh and Nv represent the
numbers of horizontal and vertical viewing directions, and can
be arbitrarily large. The (nh, nv)-th viewing direction refers
to the viewing direction in the nh-th row and nv-th column.
When a VR user is interested in one viewing direction, he
can view a rectangular FoV of size Fh × Fv with the viewing
direction as its center.

To improve transmission efﬁciency, we consider tiling. In
particular, the 360 VR video is divided into Vh×Vv rectangular
segments of the same size, referred to as tiles, where Vh and
Vv represent the numbers of segments in each row and each
column, respectively. Each tile is encoded into L versions with
L different quality levels and encoding rates. The l-th version
of each tile has the l-th lowest quality with encoding rate Dl.
Note that D1 < D2 < · · · < DL. For fairness, we assume
the tiles transmitted to all users are of the same quality level
and let D denote the corresponding encoding rate. A VR user
may watch one FoV at sometime, and freely switch to another
FoV after a while. To avoid view switch delay, for each user,
the set of tiles that cover its current FoV and the FoVs that
may be watched shortly will be delivered.

K users randomly select their viewing directions. Let Xk ∈
X denote the random viewing direction of user k, where
X , {(nh, nv)|nh = 1, . . . , Nh, nv = 1, . . . , Nv} represents
the set of all possible viewing directions of each user. Let
X , (Xk)k∈K ∈ X K denote the random system viewing
direction state. For given X, let Φk(X) denote the set of
tiles that need to be transmitted to user k, and let Φ(X) ,
∪k∈KΦk(X) denote the set of tiles that need to be transmitted
to all users. In order to make use of multicasting opportunities
and avoid redundant transmissions, we divide Φ(X) into I(X)
disjoint non-empty sets Si(X), i ∈ I(X) , {1, . . . , I(X)}.
For all i, j ∈ I(X), i 6= j, Si(X) and Sj (X) are for different
groups of users. Let Si(X) denote the number of tiles in set
Si(X). Let Ki(X) and Ki(X) denote the set and the number
of users that need to receive the tiles in Si(X). Without loss
of generality, we refer to the transmission of the tiles in Si(X)
to the users in Ki(X) as multicast, although both unicast
(Ki(X) = 1) and multicast (Ki(X) > 1) may happen.

We consider a discrete time narrow band TDMA1 system
with bandwidth B (in Hz), and study one time frame of
duration T (in seconds). Assume block fading,
i.e., each

1Note that TDMA is analytically tractable and has applications in WiFi
systems. In addition, the multicast transmission scheme and the optimization
framework for a TDMA system can be extended to an OFDMA system.

channel state (over bandwidth B) does not change within the
considered time frame. In addition, we assume that the channel
states of K users are random. Let Hk ∈ H denote the random
channel state of user k, representing the power of the channel
between user k and the server, where H denotes the ﬁnite
channel state space. Let H , (Hk)k∈K ∈ HK denote the
random system channel state.

The random system state consists of the random system
viewing direction state X and the random system channel state
H, denoted by (X, H) ∈ X K × HK.2 The probability that the
random system state (X, H) takes the value (x, h) ∈ X K ×
HK is denoted as Pr[(X, H) = (x, h)], where x , (xk)k∈K,
xk ∈ X , h , (hk)k∈K, and hk ∈ H. We assume that the
server is aware of the system state (X, H).

The time allocated to transmit the tiles in Si(X) is denoted
by ti(X, H). Thus, we have the following transmission time
allocation constraints:

ti(X, H) ≥ 0, i ∈ I(X), X ∈ X K, H ∈ HK,
ti(X, H) ≤ T, X ∈ X K , H ∈ HK.

Let pi(X, H) ≥ 0 denote the transmission power of the
symbols for the tiles in Si(X). Thus, the transmission energy
is:

III. AVERAGE TRANSMISSION ENERGY MINIMIZATION

A. Problem Formulation

Given the video quality (i.e., encoding rate of each tile
D ∈ {D1, . . . , DL}), we would like to minimize the average
transmission energy under the transmission time allocation
constraints and the transmission rate constraint.

Problem 1 (Average Transmission Energy Minimization):

E[E(t(X, H), p(X, H))]

(1), (2), (4),
where the expectation E is taken over the random system
state (X, H) ∈ X K × HK, i.e., E[E(t(X, H), p(X, H))] =
(x,h)∈X K×HK Pr[(X, H) = (x, h)]E(t(x, h), p(x, h)).

is challenging to obtain a globally

In this part, we obtain a globally optimal solution of the non-

e,j(X, H). By (5), we can
show that p†

with the assumption. Therefore, by contradiction, we can prove
Lemma 1.

Note that Si(X)DT

can eliminate p and transform Subproblem 1 into an equivalent
problem:

as in [6, pp. 243-246]. Based on the optimal solution of
Problem 2 and Lemma 1, we have the following result.

IV. RECEIVED VIDEO QUALITY MAXIMIZATION

A. Problem Formulation

i∈I(X)

Let Elimit denote the transmission energy budget of the sys-
tem. Consider the maximum transmission energy constraint:
ti(X, H)pi(X, H) ≤ Elimit, X ∈ X K, H ∈ HK.
(11)
X
To guarantee user experience, the encoding rate should not
change as frequently as the viewing directions and channel
states, and should remain constant within a certain time dura-
tion. Given the transmission energy budget Elimit, we would
like to maximize the received video quality (i.e., encoding
rate of each tile D) under the maximum transmission energy
constraint.

V. SIMULATION

In this section, we compare the proposed solutions in
Section III and Section IV with two baselines using numerical
results. Baseline 1 considers serving each user separately using
unicast in an optimal way, similar to the proposed optimal
solutions. Baseline 2 considers multicast as in this letter but
with equal time allocation for each transmitted tile and optimal
power allocation based on the equal time allocation. In the
simulation, we use Kvazaar as the 360 VR video encoder
and video sequence Boxing as the video source [7]. We set
Fh = Fv = 100◦, Nh × Nv = 36 × 2, and Vh × Vv = 30 × 15.
To avoid view switch delay, we transmit extra 15◦ in the four
directions of each requested FoV. Set B = 10 MHz, n0 =
10−9 W, T = 0.1 s, H = {0.5d, 1.5d}, Pr[Hk = 0.5d] = 0.5,
and Pr[Hk = 1.5d] = 0.5 for all k ∈ K, where d reﬂects the
path loss. For ease of exposition, we consider Zipf distribution
for the Nh × Nv viewing directions. In particular, suppose
viewing direction (nh, nv) is of rank3 (nh − 1)Nv + nv and
Pr[Xk = (nh, nv)] = ((nh−1)Nv+nv )−γ
i−γ , where γ is the Zipf
exponent. Note that a smaller γ indicates a longer tail.

i=1,...,NhNv

3Note that (nh, nv) can be an arbitrary rank, and the ranks of the viewing
directions do not inﬂuence the trends of the curves in Fig. 2 (a), but the
Zipf exponent γ does. In addition, the ranks of the viewing directions do not
inﬂuence the curves in Fig. 2 (b), as the solution of Problem 3 depends only
on X K × HK .

versus γ. K = 3, D = 30561
bit/s, d = 1 × 10−6.

Fig. 2. Performance comparison.

Fig. 2 (a) illustrates the average transmission energy versus
the Zipf exponent γ. We can see that the average transmission
energy of the two multicast schemes decreases with γ, as
multicast opportunities increases with γ. Fig. 2 (b) illustrates
the received video quality (i.e., encoding rate of each tile)
versus the path loss d. We can observe that the received video
quality of each scheme increases with the channel powers.
From Fig. 2, we can also observe that the proposed optimal
solutions outperform the two baselines. Speciﬁcally, the gains
of the proposed optimal solutions over Baseline 1 arise from
the fact that the proposed solutions utilize multicast. The gains
of the proposed optimal solutions over Baseline 2 are attributed
by the fact that the proposed solutions carefully allocate both
transmission time and transmission power.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this letter, we studied optimal multicast of tiled 360 VR
video using TDMA. We considered random viewing directions
and random channel conditions. We formulated two non-
convex optimization problems, i.e., the minimization of the
average transmission energy for given video quality, and the
maximization of the received video quality for given transmis-
sion energy budget. We obtained globally optimal closed-form
solutions of the two challenging non-convex problems and
revealed important design insights for tiled 360 VR multicast.
Finally, numerical results demonstrated the advantage of the
proposed optimal solutions.
