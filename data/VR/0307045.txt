Abstract

We present results of extensive computer simulations and theoretical analysis of vibrational

phase relaxation of a nitrogen molecule along the critical isochore and also along the gas-liquid

coexistence. The simulation includes all the diﬀerent contributions [atom-atom (AA), vibration-

rotation (VR) and resonant transfer] and their cross-correlations. Following Everitt and Skinner,

we have included the vibrational coordinate (q) dependence of the interatomic potential. It is found

that the latter makes an important contribution. The simulated results are in good agreement with

the experiments. Dephasing time (τv ) and the root mean square frequency ﬂuctuation (∆) in the

supercritical region are calculated. The principal important results are: (a) a crossover from a

Lorentzian-type to a Gaussian line shape is observed as the critical point is approached along

the isochore (from above), (b) the root mean square frequency ﬂuctuation shows nonmonotonic

dependence on the temperature along critical isochore, (c) along the coexistence line and the critical

isochore the temperature dependent linewidth shows a divergence-like λ-shape behavior, and (d)

the value of the critical exponents along the coexistence and along the isochore are obtained by

ﬁtting.

It is found that the linewidths (directly proportional to the rate of vibrational phase

relaxation) calculated from the time integral of the normal coordinate time correlation function

[CQ(t)] are in good agreement with the known experimental results. The origin of the anomalous

temperature dependence of linewidth can be traced to simultaneous occurrence of several factors,

(i) the enhancement of negative cross-correlations between AA and VR contributions and (ii) the

large density ﬂuctuations as the critical point (CP) is approached. The former makes the decay

faster so that local density ﬂuctuations are probed on a femtosecond time scale. The reason for

the negative cross-correlation between AA and VR is explored in detail. A mode coupling theory

(MCT) analysis shows the slow decay of the enhanced density ﬂuctuations near critical point. The

MCT analysis demonstrates that the large enhancement of VR coupling near CP arises from the

non-Gaussian behavior of density ﬂuctuation and this enters through a nonzero value of the triplet

direct correlation function.

INTRODUCTION

The study of vibrational phase relaxation (VPR) has been an important endeavor of

a physical chemist/chemical physicist in the attempt to understand and quantify the in-

teraction of a chemical bond with the surrounding solvent molecules [1, 2]. As the phase

relaxation of a bond is sensitive to the details of intermolecular interaction, it is a useful

tool in understanding various aspects of solute-solvent interactions. The study of VPR has

been driven by the sensitive experimental measurements of the vibrational linewidth. Thus

the theoretical results can be veriﬁed with experiments directly. Simple models such as the

isolated binary collisions model [3] and hydrodynamic model [1] were employed initially to

explain the experimental results. These models led to simple expressions of temperature,

density, and viscosity dependence of the rate. However, the agreement with experiments was

at most tentative. It was soon realized that a major diﬃculty was that dephasing derives

contributions from many sources and there may not be any unique mechanism of dephasing.

Not only the estimation of these contributions are nontrivial, even the cross-correlations

between diﬀerent pure terms are non-negligible. Thus the Kubo theory of dephasing [4]

was straightforward to apply in this case and the calculations of the frequency modulation

time correlation function turned out to be extremely diﬃcult, even for simple diatoms like

nitrogen (N2).

Uniqueness of vibrational dephasing near the critical point is that the value of mean

square frequency ﬂuctuation < ∆ω2(0) > becomes large,

leading to rapid decay of

< Q(t)Q(0) >. Many factors which are responsible for this behavior are very diﬃcult

to understand. Near high temperature vibration-rotational (VR) coupling shows large en-

hancement to < ∆ω(t)∆ω(0) > including negative cross-correlation between atom-atom and

VR coupling terms.

Many experimental studies have been carried out on N2 using vibrational Raman spec-

troscopy as a probe. Experimental studies of Clouter et al. [5, 6] showed that the isotropic

Raman line shape of simple ﬂuid like N2 may exhibit a remarkable additional broadening

near liquid-gas critical points (ρc, Tc). They measured the Raman spectra along the triple

point to the critical point and behavior of the line shape as the critical point is approached

from above at a constant density. Recently Musso et al. [7] calculated the important cross-

correlations between resonant and nonresonant dephasing mechanisms in dense liquid. They

3

observed an interesting temperature dependence λ shaped linewidth (Γ) along the coexis-

tence and along the critical isochore.

In their pioneering study, Oxtoby et al.

[1, 2, 8] showed that direct simulation of the

vibrating molecules could be avoided for most cases of interest. A quantum mechanical

perturbation theory for the vibrational motion can be used to express the dephasing rate in

terms of auto- and cross-correlation functions of bond-force terms and its derivatives. The

latter ones can then be calculated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Oxtoby et al.

calculated the linewidth and the motionally narrowed line shape of nitrogen near boiling

point (77 K) [3, 8]. They considered several contributions from (i) solvent-solute interaction

force in the liquid, (ii) their derivatives, and (iii) resonant molecular vibrational interactions

to the frequency ﬂuctuation of molecules.

Recently Gayathri et al.

[9, 10] calculated the vibrational phase relaxation of the fun-

damental and the overtones [11, 12] of the N-N stretch of nitrogen in pure nitrogen by

molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. They reproduced the experimental data semiquan-

titatively (within 40% in most cases). They have also applied the mode coupling theory

(MCT) [13, 16] to compare with the simulation results.

In their calculations they have

not include the vibrational coordinate (q) dependence of the interatomic potential and also

ignored the cross-terms among the vibration-rotation coupling term, the atom-atom term,

and the resonance term. More recently Everitt and Skinner studied the Raman line shape of

nitrogen in a systematic way by including the bond length dependence of the dispersion and

repulsive force parameters [17]. They have also included the cross-correlation terms which

were neglected earlier and the results for the line shift and the linewidth along the liquid-

gas coexistence of N2 were observed to be in very good agreement with experiments. But

calculations along the critical isochore have not been reported in their study. As mentioned

earlier, there exists a profound experimental results in this region.

In this work, we report results of extensive MD simulations of vibrational dephasing along

critical isochore. We have calculated the linewidth, the line shape, and the dephasing time

of N2 along the critical isochore and along the coexistence line. The normal coordinate time

correlation function [CQ(t)] is calculated from the frequency ﬂuctuation time correlation

function for diﬀerent state points along the coexistence line as well as along the isochore of

N2.

We have incorporated the vibrational coordinate (q) dependency of the intermolecular

4

potential and also the cross-terms. The linear expansion of the Lennard-Jones potential

parameters on vibrational coordinate is very important to get the correct sign of line shift.

The time integral of the diagonal and cross-terms of frequency ﬂuctuation time correlation

function [Cω(t)] gives the contribution to the linewidth. These cross-terms have a large eﬀect

on the linewidth to get a good agreement with experiment.

The line shape calculated from the normal coordinate time correlation function shows the

Gaussian behavior close to the critical point. Experimentally [7], it has been proved that

the line shape remains Lorentzian for the liquid near its normal boiling point (BP). The

increase in density ﬂuctuations near the critical point increases the mean square frequency

ﬂuctuation < ∆ω2

i >, transferring the line shape from its fast modulation, i.e., Lorentzian

shape limit outside the critical region to a slower modulated Gaussian shape. The root mean

square (rms) frequency ﬂuctuation of N2 calculated along the isochore shows nonmonotonic

behavior. However, the dephasing time (τv) did not show any nonmonotonicity.

II. BASIC EXPRESSIONS

The theories of the vibrational dephasing are all based on Kubo’s stochastic theory of the

line shape. This gives a simple expression for the isotropic Raman line shape [I (ω)] in terms

of Fourier transform of the normal coordinate time correlation function [CQ(t)] through the

polarizability time-correlation function as given by [4, 18],

III. SIMULATION DETAILS

We have performed a microcanonical (NVE) ensemble molecular-dynamics (MD) simu-

lation [23, 24] at diﬀerent state points of N2 ranging from the melting point (also the triple

point of N2) through the boiling point and along the critical isochore (see Fig. 2) using

the leap-frog algorithm [25]. The parameters used are given in I [26]. A system of 256

N2 diatomic molecules were enclosed in a cubic box and periodic boundary conditions were

used.

The thermodynamic state of the system is expressed in terms of the reduced number

density of ρ∗ = ρσ3 (Ref. [23]) and a reduced temperature of T ∗ = kBT /ǫ. σ is the diameter

of the molecule and ǫ is the interaction parameter (see I). The unit of temperature is ǫ/kB

(K), where kB is the Boltzmann constant. Cheung and Powels [27] had earlier studied liquid

N2 at diﬀerent state points using MD simulations. Most of the thermodynamic state points

chosen for the work presented here have been taken from their study. We have done few

simulations with a system of 512 nitrogen molecules to check the system size dependency.

Fig. 2 gives a schematic view of the phase diagram [28]. The arrowed line points out

that along the critical isochore, Tc is approached from above. For nitrogen the triple point

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS, COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENT AND DIS-

CUSSION

A. Along the coexistence line

The frequency-modulation time correlation function [Cω(t)], the dephasing linewidth,
and the line shift [29] are all obtained for several thermodynamic state points ranging from

triple point to critical point.

We have calculated the line shift ∆ν = (

ωii −

h

ω0)/2πc as a function of density for

nitrogen. The magnitude of the line shift increases with density as clearly seen in Fig. 3(a)

and the results are in good agreement with the experiment. The vibrational coordinate

dependence is important to get the correct sign of the line shift.

Along the coexistence line the root mean square frequency ﬂuctuation (∆) increases as

the critical point is approached. Fig. 3(b) shows that ∆ decreases linearly with density with

a slope of -0.3624.

B. Along the critical isochore

We have plotted Cω(t) against time for three diﬀerent temperatures along the critical

isochore in Fig. 4. The lines with open circles show Cω(t) which decays faster than Cω(t)

represented by the simple line.

The temperature dependence of the dephasing time (τv) calculated by integration of Cω(t)

[Eq. 7] is comparable with experimental results (see II).

In Fig. 5, a simple line represents the normal coordinate time correlation function without

including q dependency of LJ parameters whereas the dashed line represents the same results

with q dependent LJ parameters. The former one has a larger correlation time than the latter

one. The CQ(t) clearly shows the importance of q dependence.

Fig. 6 displays the root mean square frequency ﬂuctuation ∆ [=

∆ω2(0)] calculated

from unnormalized Cω(0) at diﬀerent temperatures along the isochore. The calculated ∆

p

shows a nonmonotonic behavior with temperature. ∆ initially increases with temperature

and shows a maximum near critical temperature indicated by an arrow. A sharp decrease is

observed for the temperature greater than Tc. The increase in density ﬂuctuation near the

ﬂuctuation time correlation function. We shall come back to this point a bit later.

A crossover from Lorentzian-type line shape to Gaussian line shape is found to take place

when there is a large separation in the time scales of decay of Cω(t) and CQ(t) [7, 8] cease to

exist and the two time correlation functions begin to overlap. We have calculated Cω(t) and

CQ(t) at three temperatures near the critical point (see Fig. 8). The decay of Cω(t) becomes

signiﬁcantly faster, reducing the gap of decay between the two correlation functions. Indeed,

We ﬁtted all simulation points with Gaussian. The ﬁtting formula is y = a[e−b(x−c)2

the computed line shape becomes Gaussian near the critical point but otherwise remains

Lorentzian-type both above and below the critical temperature. Note that the frequency

modulation time correlation function decays fully in about 200 fs.

To understand the origin of this critical behavior, we have carefully analyzed each one of

the six terms which consist of three autocorrelations and three cross-terms between density,

vibration-rotation coupling, and resonance terms which have been mentioned earlier.

Fig. 9 shows the time dependence of the four dominating terms , the two autocorrelations
[Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 9(b)] and two cross-correlations (Fig. 9(c) and Fig. 9(d)). The

decompositions of line shift, linewidth, and the temperature dependent quantities are fully

dependent on the contributions which come from all six terms. As we approach the critical

point along the critical isochore, the magnitude of contributions from diﬀerent terms are

The sharp rise in the value of the integrand as the critical temperature is approached and

the fall when it is crossed. We have found that both these contributions at the critical point

are distinct compared to the other state points. Thus the rise and fall of the dephasing rate

arise partly from the rise and fall in the density and the vibration-rotation terms. We have

calculated the slopes of the relative contributions by the linear ﬁtting in the long time at a

particular temperature T = 125.3 K. The values of the slope are 5.4

V. DYNAMICAL HETEROGENEITIES NEAR THE CRITICAL POINT.

We have investigated the presence of dynamical heterogeneities in the ﬂuid to further

explore the origin of these anomalous critical temperature eﬀects [30, 31]. This can be

quantiﬁed by the well-known non-Gaussian parameter α(t). It is deﬁned as [32]

where < ∆r(t)2 > is the mean squared displacement and < ∆r(t)4 > the mean quartic

hence Gaussian behavior) at a time scale larger than the time scale required for individual

VI. NEGATIVE CROSS-CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DENSITY AND VR

COUPLING TERM

The role of cross-terms (which can be negative) are extremely important for the decay

of Cω(t) which occurs in the femtosecond time scale along the critical isochore. We have

calculated the cross-terms among density, VR coupling, and resonance term. The cross-
terms of VR coupling with density and resonance are found to be negative [see Figs. 9(c)
and 9(d)]. As mentioned earlier the major contributions to the frequency ﬂuctuation come

from the density as well as from the VR coupling term. One of the main reasons for ultrafast

decay of Cω is the cancellations of negative cross-terms from the total contribution.

Now the question is why are these cross-terms are negative? The distribution of density

dependent and the VR coupling dependent part of the total frequency ﬂuctuation along the

isochore are shown in Figs. 12(a) and 12(b), respectively. The peak of those distributions is

near zero δωV R which proves that the homogeneity condition is satisﬁed along the isochore.

It is evident that the distribution of δωV R is always positive while the distribution of δωρ

showed the long negative tail. The distribution of the product of density and VR coupling

terms are plotted for diﬀerent temperatures in Fig. 13. It is clearly seen that this distribution

is negative. A detailed analysis of the origin of the negative sign of the cross-correlation

between AA and VR coupling terms is given in Appendix B. On the other hand ∆ωρ is

directly proportional to the force acting on the bond of the diatoms. If force F is large, the

velocity will be large and it reﬂects that the J 2 will be decreased when F is increased and

vice versa. This is the origin of anticorrelation between the density and VR coupling terms

in Cω(t).

The distribution of correlation between the density-density term and the VR-VR cou-

pling term in the frequency ﬂuctuation time correlation function are shown in Figs. 14(a)

and 14(b), respectively. Both distributions are positive and the homogeneity condition of

frequency ﬂuctuations is satisﬁed in both cases.

VII. MODE COUPLING THEORY ANALYSIS.

We can use mode coupling theory to obtain an expression for the atom-atom contribution

to the frequency modulation time correlation function. The main steps have already been

discussed by Gayathri et al. [10] and need not be repeated here. In brief, MCT gives the fol-

lowing expression for the density dependent frequency modulation time correlation function

[33] considering that the number density is the only relevant slow variable in dephasing,

Where c(k) is the Fourier transform of the two particle direct correlation function. The main

contribution is derived from the long wavelength (that is small k) region near the critical

point (CP). In the small k limit the hydrodynamic expressions for two-point correlation

functions are given by

However, a limitation of the above analysis is the absence of the VR term which contributes

signiﬁcantly and may mask some of the critical eﬀects.

as discussed earlier by Mukamel et al.

[34]. At high

temperature, the latter dominates over the density term. We have calculated the line shape

and ﬁtted with the Fourier transform of Levy distribution ( see Fig. 15). Clearly as Tc is

approached, the low k ﬂuctuations become more important and, if the high k contributions

are suﬃciently small, they will dominate the line shape. We would like to mention that

the line shape becomes Gaussian (see the Fig. 15) instead of the Fourier transform of Levy

distribution near the critical point. The small k picture described here is quite from the usual

collisional broadening picture of dephasing. A complete Lorentzian behavior is predicted

only in the low temperature liquid phase.

Interestingly, the predicted divergence of <

∆ω2(0) > very close to Tc enhances the rate of dephasing and this shifts the decay of

< Q(t)Q(0) > to short times, which gives rise to the Gaussian behavior.

We next use MCT to analyze the cross-correlation between VR coupling and the atom-

energy (Vef f ) of the mean ﬁeld force [F =

The calculation of the VR term is a bit more complicated. The angular momentum J(t) at

time t can be expressed in terms of torque N(t′) at earlier times (t′ > t),

We now analyze Eq. (31) term by term. Since both J and δρ are uncoupled at the same

time, the contribution of I is zero. The second term II in Eq. (31) consists of two density

29

terms with an angular momentum term. Using cumulant expansion we can show that the

contribution of II is also equal to zero.

To evaluate the third term (III), we factorize the translational and angular variables in

the two-particle direct correlation function (DCF) and we can write

If we assume that the density eﬀects are included in the spatial part c0(

expression of the angular part of the direct correlation function will be ﬁnite and nonzero.

If one assumes that the δρ are Gaussian random variables, then the value of the triplet

correlation function in III is zero, by cumulant expansion. However, the distribution of

the ﬂuctuation in number density clearly shows a non-Gaussian behavior, arising from the

long lived heterogeneity near critical point (see Fig. 11). We, therefore, expect a nonzero

value of the cross-correlation between VR coupling and atom-atom terms from the triplet

correlation function in Eq. (31). Moreover, the amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted

to be small at all temperatures away from Tc but it is predicted to become signiﬁcant as Tc

is approached, where the density ﬂuctuation becomes non-Gaussian.

We have calculated the term ∆R in Eq. 38 (see Appendix B) and found it to be always
positive. It is obvious that J 2 > 0. So we can conclude that δωV R > 0 [see Fig. 12b].

Figure 12(a) shows that most of the distribution of ﬂuctuation in δωρ are in the negative

direction. On the other hand the distribution of ﬂuctuation in δωV R is in the positive
direction [see Fig. 12b]. Here, ∆ωρ = (n~(

The above analysis MCT demonstrates that the large enhancement of vibration-rotation

coupling near the gas-liquid critical point arises from the non-Gaussian behavior of density

ﬂuctuation and this enters through a nonzero value of the triplet direct correlation function
[Eq. (31)].

VIII. DIVERGENCE OF RAMAN LINEWIDTH NEAR THE CP

Along the coexistence line and the critical isochore, we have found that the temperature

dependence of the linewidth (Γ) is singular near the critical point. The divergence-like

rise near Tc is ﬁtted to a form (T

the critical isochore.

Above Tc, the ﬂuctuations [16] are small which cause the resonance lines to be homoge-

neously broadened and the line shape is Lorentzian. On approaching Tc, the ﬂuctuations

[35, 36] become large and their correlation time also increases, as a consequence the line

shape becomes Gaussian.

It is likely that simulations are not suﬃciently close to Tc because simulations are ﬁnite sized.

The reason for the relative success of a small system in reproducing experimental behavior

is that dephasing probes only local static ﬂuctuations. Thus long range static and dynamic

correlations important in speciﬁc heat, compressibility, or light scattering are not relevant in

vibrational dephasing. Second, while our simulated system can certainly capture the increase

in ﬂuctuation, it can never capture the long range ﬂuctuations. But it captures enough to

reproduce many of the features. Note that even a small system is capable of exhibiting

large ﬂuctuations near the gas-liquid coexistence/critical point. Put bluntly, truly large

scale critical ﬂuctuations are neither required nor reﬂected for dephasing simply because

dephasing is a local process.

IX. CONCLUSION

In this article extensive MD simulations of vibrational phase relaxation of nitrogen have

been presented. The simulations reported here seem to reproduce many of the anomalies

31

observed in experiments. It shows (a) the origin of enhanced negative cross-correlations, (b) a

crossover from a Lorentzian-type to a Gaussian line shape as the critical point is approached,

(c) the non-monotonic dependence of rms frequency ﬂuctuation on temperature along the

critical isochore, (d) a lambda shaped dependence of linewidth on temperature, and (e) a

near divergence of linewidth near the critical point.

XII. APPENDIX B: FREQUENCY MODULATION FROM VIBRATION-

ROTATION COUPLING

The vibration-rotation centrifugal coupling term is Evib−rot = J 2

2I , where I(= 2µr2) is
the moment of inertia and µ is the reduced mass of a diatomic molecule. This VR term is

important only when I depends on vibrational coordinate (q) through the bond length, i.e.,

r(q) = r0 + ∆r(q). Expanding this as a Taylor series about the equilibrium bond length r0,

the Evib−rot can be rewritten as
