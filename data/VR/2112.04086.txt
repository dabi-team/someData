Abstract—Network  reconfiguration  (NR)  has  attracted  much 
attention  due  to  its  ability  to  convert  conventional  distribution 
networks (DNs) into self-healing grids. This paper proposes a new 
strategy for real-time voltage regulation (VR) in a reconfigurable 
DN,  whereby  optimal  feedforward  control  of  synchronous  and 
inverter-based  distributed  generators  (DGs)  is  achieved  in 
coordination  with  the  operation  of  feeder  line  switches  (SWs). 
This enables preemptive compensation of upcoming deviations in 
DN  voltages  caused  by  NR-aided  load  restoration.  A  robust 
optimization  problem  is  formulated  using  a  dynamic  analytical 
model of NR to design the feedforward voltage controllers (FVCs) 
that  minimize  voltage  deviations  with  respect  to  the  H∞  norm. 
Errors in the estimates of DG parameters and load demands are 
reflected  in  the  design  of  optimal  FVCs  through  polytopic 
uncertainty  modeling,  further  improving  the  robustness  of  the 
proposed VR strategy. Small-signal analysis and case studies are 
conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of the optimal robust 
FVCs  in  improving  real-time  VR  when  NR  is  activated  for  load 
restoration.  The  performances  of  the  proposed  FVCs  are  also 
verified  under  various  operating  conditions  of  a  reconfigurable 
DN,  characterized  principally  by  SW  operations,  network 
parameter errors, and communication time delays.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

E 

XTREME  weather  events,  such  as  floods  and  storms,  are 
increasingly threatening the reliability of distribution power 
grids. In the United States, the costs of weather-related power 
outages  were  estimated  to  range  between  approximately  $25 
billion and $70 billion per year during the period from 2003 to 
2012  [1].  Over  this  period,  the  annual  number  of  major 
weather-related  outages,  which  affected  at  least  50,000 
customers,  increased  from  less  than  40  to  more  than  80  [2]. 
Moreover,  90%  of  outages  occurred  at  the  distribution  levels 
[1]–[3].  This  emphasizes  that  improving  the  resilience  of 
distribution  networks  (DNs)  is  of  key  importance  when 
establishing future smart grids [4], [5]. 

Dynamic network reconfiguration (NR) has attracted much 
attention. This enhances the resilience by enabling self-healing 
operations of DNs. NR changes the topological structure of the 
DN  through  on-off  operations  of  line  switches  (SWs). 
Distribution line faults can then be isolated, and de-energized 
loads  are  re-connected  to  distribution  feeders  where  load 
services are sustained by power supplied from main substations 
and distributed generators (DGs).  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  most  prior  studies  regarding  NR  (e.g.,  [6]–[9]),  the 
operational schedules of SWs were determined in advance, for 
example, to maximize the restored, critical load demand, while 
minimizing  the  time  required  for  load  service  restoration. 
However, scheduling was achieved while considering only the 
steady-state  operations  of  reconfigurable  DNs.  Only  time- 
invariant or hourly-sampled profiles of load demand were taken 
into  account;  DGs  were  regarded  as  point  sources  and  their 
dynamic  responses  were  thus  neglected.  Consecutive  SW 
operations  are  very  likely  to  cause  sudden  variations  in  load 
demand,  which  in  turn  triggers  abrupt  fluctuations  of  DN 
voltages in  the transient state. Given the  small capacities and 
low  inertias  of  DGs,  voltage  fluctuations  can  cause  further 
unexpected  tripping  of  DGs  and  cascading  collapses  of  DN 
voltages. This implies that it is essential to accurately reflect the 
dynamic response characteristics of DGs, loads, and bus volt- 
ages into NR-aided load restoration. 

In  [10]–[12],  the  dynamic  responses  of  DG  and  load  units 
were reflected into the optimization problems to schedule the 
optimal  operations  of  SWs,  while  maintaining  DN  voltages 
within acceptable ranges for each SW operation. Synchronous 
generators  (SGs)  were  mainly  considered  as  the  DG  units, 
although their dynamics were somewhat simplified. In [13] and 
[14], optimal NR scheduling was performed with consideration 
of  the  transient  variations  in  DN  voltages  during  load 
restoration  via  trial-and-error  approaches.  The  sizes  and 
locations  of  de-energized  loads  that  can  be  restored  without 
violating  constraints  on  transient  voltage  variations  were 
pre-selected  through  iterative  simulation.  However,  load 
services  were  recovered  using  SGs  alone,  rather  than  SGs  in 
cooperation with inverter-based generators (IGs). Moreover, in 
[10]–[14], real-time DG control was achieved by conventional 
feedback control loops [15] that came into effect only after DN 
voltages  had  substantially  deviated  because  of  NR.  Thus, 
current  real-time  voltage  regulation  (VR)  in  a  reconfigurable 
DN can be further improved. 

Only a few recent works (e.g., [16]–[18]) have investigated 
the  coordination  of  DGs  and  SWs  to  improve  real-time  VR 
during  load  service  restoration.  In  particular,  supplementary 
feedback control loops were established between SGs and SWs 
[16]  and  between  IGs  and  SWs  [17],  [18].  These  allowed 
adjustment  of  the  terminal  voltages  of  SGs  and  IGs,  for 
example, by reference to the on-off status and terminal voltages 
of  SWs  and  the  currents  flowing  through  the  SWs.  The 
adjustments  maintained  the  differences  between  the  terminal 
voltages of each SW at zero prior to NR; otherwise, large inrush 
currents  were  likely  to  occur,  leading  to  severe  voltage 
fluctuations. However, such supplementary control is possible 
only  when  the  feeders  of  both  terminals  of  the  SW  are 
energized. Thus, the method is not applicable to NR-aided load 
restoration, because the voltages become zero at SW terminals 
that  are  connected  to  interrupted  loads.  Consequently,  the 
terminal  voltages  of  SGs  and  IGs  still  need  to  be  regulated 
through conventional feedback control, as in [10]–[15]. 

These  issues  have  motivated  the  development  of  new 
strategies  to  preemptively  regulate  DN  voltage  deviations 
caused  by  NR,  because  NR  is  commonly  performed  in  a 

2 

controlled  manner.  To  develop  such  VR  strategies,  the 
literature  research  gap  between  the  dynamic  NR  models  and 
their application to DG control needs to be filled first. In [10]–
[14],  NR  was  simply  modeled  as  the  amount  of  load  to  be 
restored or shed, rather than a change in the network topology 
itself.  This  compromises  the  estimation  accuracy  of  the 
dynamic  responses  of  DGs  and  loads  to  the  SW  operations 
involved  in  NR-aided  load  restoration.  In  addition,  the 
uncertainties in estimates of DG and load parameters were not 
explicitly  considered  in  [6]–[18],  although  uncertainties  are 
inevitable in real DNs. When uncertainties are neglected, pre- 
emptive  regulation  of  DN  voltages  can  become  practically 
ineffective, failing to ensure stable operation of DNs. 

In this paper, we propose a new strategy for real-time VR of 
a reconfigurable DN. Optimal feedforward control of SGs and 
IGs  is  achieved  in  coordination  with  the  SW  operations  to 
preemptively mitigate voltage deviations at DG terminal buses 
attributable to NR. The dynamic responses of bus voltages to 
NR are estimated using an analytical model of a reconfigurable 
DN; these responses are integrated into a robust optimization 
problem  to  design  optimal  feedforward  voltage  controllers 
(FVCs) that minimize voltage deviations. Uncertainties in the 
estimates of DG parameters and load demands are considered 
during  optimization,  further  improving  the  robustness  of 
optimal FVC operations. The FVCs are incorporated in parallel 
with existing  feedback control loops to eliminate  steady-state 
variations in DG terminal voltages. A small-signal analysis and 
case  studies  are  conducted  to  assess  the  performance  of  the 
proposed VR strategy using comprehensive models of DGs. 

The main contributions of this paper are summarized below:  
• To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report 
feedforward control of SGs and IGs in coordination with SW 
operations  to  improve  real-time  VR  in  a  reconfigurable  DN 
during load service restoration through NR. 

•  A  convex  optimization  problem  is  formulated  to  develop 
the optimal robust FVCs that minimize the upcoming variations 
in DG terminal voltages due to NR in the sense of H∞ norm. 

• Errors in the estimates of DG parameters and load demands 
are  reflected  in  the  optimization  problem  using  a  polytopic 
uncertainty  model,  further  enhancing  the  effectiveness  and 
robustness of the optimal FVCs when applied to real DNs.  

•  Comparative  small-signal  analysis  and  numerical  case 
studies  are  comprehensively  conducted  under  various  grid 
conditions, characterized by SW operations, uncertainty levels, 
and communication delays. 

II.  FUNDAMENTALS AND FRAMEWORK 

In  distribution  feeders,  NR  is  achieved  through  on-off 
operations of SWs such as sectionalizing switches (SSWs) and 
tie  switches  (TSWs).  SSWs  are  installed  along  individual 
feeders, and TSWs are installed between feeders. The current 
practices  and  standards  [19],  [20]  state  that  a  distribution 
system  operator  (DSO)  should  send  either  automatically  or 
manually binary signals (zero to one or vice versa) to SSWs and 
TSWs via communication links  when changing  on-off  status. 
Note  that  the  switching  sequences  or  schedules  are  often 
pre-determined, as discussed in Section I, and the binary signals

can serve as NR-initiating signals in the proposed VR strategy. 
Moreover, in general, DGs regulate their terminal voltages to 
the  reference  values  in  real  time,  while  supplying  active  and 
reactive  power  to  distribution  feeders.  Real-time  VR  at  DG 
terminal  buses  facilitates  the  DSO  to  support  bus  voltages 
across a DN. Conventionally, VR has been achieved using the 
feedback  control  loops  of  individual  DGs,  commonly  by 
employing proportional-integral (PI) controllers [15], [21].  

Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the proposed strategy 
for  a  reconfigurable  DN,  wherein  the  FVCs  of  SGs  and  IGs 
generate reference signals for the field exciters and the q-axis 
inner control loops, respectively, in response to binary signals 
(or, alternatively, the NR-initiating signals). In Fig. 1, Hi(s) and 
Mk(s)  represent  the  FVCs  for  SG  unit  i  and  IG  unit  k, 
respectively. The FVCs are implemented in the same locations 
as  the  DGs,  and  then  incorporated  in  parallel  to  existing 
feedback  control  loops.  The  FVCs  enable  SGs  and  IGs  to 
respond  faster  and  preemptively  to  forthcoming  variations  in 
the  terminal  voltages  caused  by  NR,  thus  allowing  existing 
feedback  loops  to  better  compensate  for  remaining  voltage 
variations. This improves the transient stability of bus voltages 
throughout  the  DN  in  a  more  robust  manner  than  feedback 
control loops alone. 

In this paper, the FVCs are optimized using only information 
that is commonly available on a reconfigurable DN, SGs, and 
IGs. The optimal FVC parameters are updated online based on 
the  current  load  demand  and  the  locations  of  target  SWs  to 
better  reflect  the  time-varying  dynamics  of  a  DN,  as  in  the 
common  multi-controller  architecture  [22].  Delivery  of  an 
NR-initiating  signal  and  updating  of  the  FVC  parameters  are 
performed  only  when  SW  operations  are  involved.  This 
mitigates  the  requirement  for  high-bandwidth  communication 
networks,  thus  facilitating  implementation  of  the  proposed 
strategy in real DNs. 

III.  DESIGN OF OPTIMAL ROBUST FVCS 

adapted  for  its  application  to  supplementary  feedforward 
control  of  SGs  and  IGs  in  response  to  NR-initiating  signals. 
Briefly, (1)–(5) show the analytical model of the reconfigurable 
DN, given the parameters of the SGs, IGs, voltage-dependent 
loads, and three-phase distribution lines, as:  

ΔX

DN(t) = ADN∙ΔXDN(t) + BDG∙ΔUFF(t) + BNR·u(t), 

(1) 

(2) 
ΔVDG(t) = CDG∙ΔXDN(t), 
where  ΔXDN = [ΔXSG1, …, ΔXSGG, ΔXIG1, …, ΔXIGL]T,     (3) 
ΔUFF  = [ΔUSG1, …, ΔUSGG, ΔUIG1, …, ΔUIGL]T, 
(4) 
ΔVDG = [ΔVSG1, …, ΔVSGG, ΔVIG1, …, ΔVIGL]T. 
Please refer to Appendix A for details. In (1), u(t) is the NR- 
initiating signal. This can also represent a signal generated at 
any arbitrary time t without loss of generality, when ADN, BDG, 
BNR, and CDG are accordingly updated prior to NR. Thus, (1)–
(5) can be applied to the consecutive operations of SWs. Note 
that the updating is performed based on the load demand and 
the SW locations, as discussed in Section II. 
B.  Formulation of the Robust Optimization Problem 
The proposed FVCs are designed in the form as: 

(5) 

FF(t) = AFF∙ΔXFF(t) + BFF∙u(t), 

ΔX
ΔUFF(t) = CFF∙ΔXFF(t),        

(6) 

(7) 

where  AFF,  BFF,  and  CFF  are  the  control  parameters  to  be 
optimally determined. The size of ΔXFF is set to be the same as 
that of ΔXDN in (1)–(3), so that an optimization problem for the 
design of the FVCs can be formulated using only linear matrix 
inequality (LMI) constraints. Accordingly, the sizes of AFF, BFF, 
and  CFF  become  the  same  as  those  of  ADN,  BDN,  and  CDG, 
respectively. Moreover, in (6), the NR-initiating signal u(t) is 
used  as  the  common  input  to  the  FVCs,  enabling  preemptive 
compensation for voltage deviations at all DG terminal buses. 
Note that u(t–Td) is used to analyze the effect of a communi- 
cation time delay Td on FVC performance in Sections IV and V. 

A.  Dynamic Responses of DG Terminal Voltages to NR 

DSO

NR to ΔVDG: (1), (2)

To design the proposed FVCs, the dynamic responses of DG 
terminal voltages to SW operations are first estimated using an 
analytical model of the reconfigurable DN. In a previous work 
[23],  the  analytical  model  was  developed,  wherein  NR  was 
considered  to  be  a  change  in  the  DN  topology  itself.  This 
improved  the  estimation  accuracies  of  network  voltage 
responses,  compared  with  estimates  of  conventional  models 
where  NR  was  simply  regarded  as  the  load  demand  to  be 
restored or shed. In this paper, the analytical model is further

Given (10)–(12), the control parameters (i.e., AFF, BFF, and CFF) 
of the FVCs are determined to minimize the H∞ norm of ΔVDG(t) 
(i.e., ||G(s)||∞) by solving the optimization problem:

where  the  element-wise  expression  of   1  in  (14)  is  shown 
below. Please see Appendix B for the detailed derivation of P1. 
Briefly, in (13),  represents the upper bound of ||G(s)||∞, which 
corresponds  to  the  peak  value  in  the  frequency  response  of 
ΔVDG(t)  to  u(t).  Thus,  P1  is  formulated  to  achieve  robust 
operation  of  the  optimal  FVCs  in  a  reconfigurable  DN.  The 
constraints  (14)  and  (15)  are  required  to  ensure  bus  voltage 
stability  in  the  Lyapunov  sense.  In  other  words,  the  optimal 
1–5,  and )  of  P1  is  obtained  such  that  all 
solution  (i.e., ,
poles  of  G(s)  are  located  in  the  left-hand  half  plane  (LHP). 
Moreover, (16) specifies the  upper bound  (i.e., γ) of the total 
energy  of  ΔUFF;  this  prevents  the  excessive  operation  of  the 
optimal FVCs and hence the DGs.  

As shown in (13)–(17), P1 is a convex optimization problem 
with a linear objective function and LMI constraints. Therefore, 
P1  can  be  readily  solved  in  real  time  using  a  common, 
off-the-shelf  LMI  solver.  Given  a  solution  of  P1,  the  optimal 
control parameters of the FVCs are determined as:

C.  Uncertainties in the Estimates of DG and Load Parameters 
As shown in (17), P1 is formulated using ADN, BDG, and BNR, 
which include the parameter estimates of the SGs, IGs, voltage- 
dependent loads, and distribution lines. Note that CDG contains

only  ones  and  zeros  as  elements;  thus,  CDG  is  not  associated 
with  the  uncertainty.  In  practice,  uncertainties  in  parameter 
estimates compromise the estimation accuracies of bus voltage 
responses to NR and hence the performances of optimal FVCs. 
In  [24]–[26],  sensitivity  analyses  revealed  particularly  large 
effects of the exciter amplifier gains KA of  SGs and the  filter 
inductances  Lf of IGs on transient  variations in  their terminal 
voltages.  The  load  demand  Sr  to  be  restored  also  affects  the 
extent to which the voltages deviate in both the transient state 
and the steady state after NR [13], [14]. Thus, in this paper, P1 
is extended to consider uncertainties in the estimates of KA, Lf, 
and Sr, further enhancing the robustness of the optimal FVCs 
and their applicability in real DNs.  

Specifically, the effects of uncertainties in the estimates of 
KA, Lf, and Sr on ADN, BDG, and BNR are first evaluated using the 
polytopic  uncertainty  model  [27],  shown  in  Fig.  3,  where  a 
convex polytope set  is established as:  

 = Co{[ADN1, BDG1, BNR1], …, [ADNV, BDGV, BNRV]}.  (20) 

In (20), the vertices of  correspond to [ADNv, BDGv, BNRv] for 
v =  1,  …,  V,  determined  using  the  maximum  and  minimum 
error  percentages  in  the  nominal  estimates  of  KA,  Lf,  and  Sr. 
Using the polytopic uncertainty model, the optimal parameters 
of FVCs are determined to minimize the H∞ norm of ΔVDG(t) 
for all inaccurate estimates of ADN, BDG, and BNR within , by 
solving the optimization problem: 
P2: Extension of P1 to reflect estimation uncertainty

 (15) and (16).  

A comparison of (14) and (22) shows that 1 is extended to 1v 
by replacing  ADN, BDG, and BNR in (17) with ADNv, BDGv, and 
BNRv  in  (20),  respectively,  for  all  v.  Extension  of 1  to 1v 
further  improves  the  robustness  of  the  optimal  FVCs  against 
uncertainties in the estimates of the DG and load parameters. 
Uncertainties of other parameter estimates also can be readily 
reflected in the optimization problem P2 through the polytopic 
uncertainty  modeling.  The  objective  function  and  the  const- 
raints on 2, 3, 1, 2, and  remain the same as in P1. Thus, P2 
remains  a  convex  optimization  problem  that  can  be  readily 
solved.  After  P2  is  solved,  AFF,  BFF,  and  CFF  are  determined 
using (18) and (19), as for P1.

IV.  SMALL-SIGNAL ANALYSIS  

A.  Contribution of the Optimal FVCs to Real-time VR 

A small-signal analysis of the proposed VR strategy has been 
conducted with the optimal FVCs discussed in Section III. In 
the frequency domain, G(s) [i.e., (10)–(12)] was analyzed for a 
reconfigurable  DN  with  the  model  parameters  specified  in 
Section  V  (see  Fig.  8  and  Table  II).  Fig.  4  shows  that  all 
eigenvalues of G(s) for TSW and SSW operations are placed on 
the  LHP,  confirming  that  the  proposed  strategy  ensures  bus 
voltage stability. Fig. 5 shows the singular value plots (SVPs) 
of G(s) for the proposed strategy, compared with the SVPs of 
the conventional strategy  using  feedback control loops alone. 
Note that an SVP is an extension of the Bode magnitude plot 
commonly  used  to  evaluate  multi-input  and  multi-output 
systems  [28].  In  Fig.  5,  the  proposed  strategy  substantially 
attenuates bus voltage deviations caused by the SW operations, 
compared  with  the  conventional  strategy,  thus  improving  the 
real-time VR of a reconfigurable DN. 

B.  Sensitivity Analysis 

The  proposed  VR  strategy  is  further  analyzed  while 
considering uncertainties in the estimates of KA, Lf, and Sr, as 
discussed  in  Section  III-C.  For  brevity,  the  SGs  and  IGs  are 
assumed to exhibit the same error percentages in the nominal 
values of KA and Lf, respectively; the load units to be restored 
are assumed to exhibit the same error percentages in Sr. Fig. 6 
shows  the  SVPs  of  G(s)  in  the  proposed  and  conventional 
strategies when the error percentages vary by ± 30% [24], [29]. 
The proposed strategy still leads to lower magnitudes of G(s) 
and  smaller  variations  in  the  magnitudes,  particularly  in  the 
frequency range less than approximately  1.19 × 102 Hz. This 
verifies  the  robustness  of  the  proposed  strategy  against  large 
uncertainties in the estimates of the DG and load parameters.

Note  that  the  second-order  padé  approximation  of e–sTd  was 
adopted in (24). Fig. 7 and Table I compare the performances of 
the  proposed  and  conventional  strategies  when  Td  increases 
from 0.1 to 0.6 s. Delayed FVC activations render ΔVDG less 
attenuated,  particularly 
from 
approximately 1.03 × 10–2 Hz to 3.29 × 102 Hz, compared with 
synchronous  activation  [i.e.,  G(s)].  However,  the  proposed 
strategy  still  leads  to  smaller  ||Gd(s)||∞  and  ||Gd(s)||2  values, 
compared with the conventional strategy, for all Td. In real DNs, 
the  communication  time  delays  were  reported  to  be  less  than 
0.540 s  [30],  confirming  the  practical  applicability  of  the

responses, Td has no effect on voltage stability in the proposed 
strategy because, in (24) and (25), d(s) is stable in the bounded- 
input and bounded-output sense. Moreover, the eigenvalues of 
(sI – AOD)–1 are the eigenvalues of G(s), all of which are on the 
LHP (see Fig. 4). 

V.  CASE STUDIES AND SIMULATION RESULTS 

A.  Test System and Simulation Conditions 

The proposed VR  strategy  was tested on the DN shown in 
Fig. 8, modeled using the IEEE 37-node Test Feeder [31] with 
modifications  based  on  [16]  and  [32].  Table  II  lists  the 
corresponding modeling parameters. Specifically, the test DN 
includes SSWs and TSWs that can adaptively change the DN 
topology in real time. Fig. 8 shows the initial on-off status when 
two faults occurred at the feeders between Buses 707 and 720 
and Buses 711 and 738. Moreover, the test DN contains three 
SGs and five IGs, with total power capacities of 1.8 MVA and 
1.0 MVA, respectively. The total load demand was 2.6 + j1.2 
MVA  and  was  distributed  to  the  load  units  connected  to  all 
buses. For simplicity, the load units were assumed to have the 
same ZIP coefficients of 1.5, –2.3, and 1.8 for active power and 
of 7.4, –12, and 5.6 for reactive power. Three-phase balanced 
lines  were  also  adopted  with  impedances  set  as  the  average 
value over the three phases for each line configuration. 

In  addition,  Fig.  9  and  Table  III  show  the  self-healing 
scenario,  wherein  the  SSWs  and  TSWs  operate  to  restore 
de-energized loads in Areas 1 and 3. The non-critical loads in 
Area  2  were  disconnected  to  support  bus  voltages  across  the 
DN, and then re-energized after the load restorations in Areas 1 
and 3  were completed. In general, SWs are operated one at a 
time to prevent excessive voltage and frequency fluctuations in 
the transient state [13]. In this paper, the time intervals between 
SW  operation  were  set  to  10  s.  For  each  SW  operation,  the 
optimal  control  parameters  of  the  FVCs  were  determined 
within 2 s by solving P2 using the MATLAB toolbox YALMIP.  

B. Performance of the Proposed VR Strategy 

The proposed and conventional VR strategies were compara- 
tively analyzed for the operations of TSW2 and SSW1 of the test 
DN. Table IV lists the main features of the proposed strategy 
(Cases  1  and  2)  and  conventional  strategy  (Cases  3  and  4) 
strategies. Cases 1 and 3 were compared to examine the effects

optimal  FVCs  against  errors  in  the  parameter  estimates, 
compared with the existing robust controller discussed in [24].

Operating statuses of the test DN 
Faults occur at the feeders between Buses 707 and 720 and 
between  Buses  711  and  738,  leading  to  opening  of  TSW2 
and SSW2, 6, 7 for isolation of the faults. 
At t = t1, TSW1 is closed to reduce the line power losses (see 
Fig. 9(a)). This enables the DGs to secure additional reserve 
capacity for subsequent load restorations. At t = t2, SSW4 is 
opened to recover the radial structure of the DN. 
TSW2 and SSW3 are closed at t = t3 and t = t4, respectively, 
to restore the de-energized loads in Area 1 (see Fig. 9(b)). 
The  non-critical  loads  in  Area  2  are  de-energized  by 
opening SSW1 at t = t5 (see Fig. 9(c)) to increase the DG 
reserve  capacity  and  support  the  DN  voltages.  TSW4  and 
SSW5 then operate at t = t6 and t = t7, respectively, to reduce 
line power losses, further increasing the reserve capacity. 
TSW3 and SSW6 are closed at t = t8 and t = t9, respectively, 
to restore the de-energized loads in Area 3 (see Fig. 9(d)). 
At t = t10, SSW3 is closed to restore the non-critical loads in 
Area  2.  The  self-healing  operation  terminates  after  the 
faults are investigated and cleared.

The percentage errors were set to 30% for both Cases 2 and 4, 
based on the small-signal analysis of Section IV-B. 

Fig. 10(a) shows the terminal voltages of SG1, IG1, and IG2 
located  near  TSW2  and  SSW1.  The  proposed  strategy 
significantly  reduced  voltage  deviations  caused  by 
the 
NR-aided  load  restoration  and  shedding,  compared  with  the 
conventional strategies. This led to the considerable reduction 
of  the  transient  voltage  deviations  at  buses  where  only  loads 
were connected, as shown in Fig. 10(b). The proposed strategy 
also  decreased  the  settling  times  of  voltage  deviations  and 
hence  the  time  required  for  consecutive  SW  operations, 
facilitating  self-healing  of  the  DN.  For  all  buses,  ∆Vrms,avg, 
∆Vpk,max, and ∆Tset,max were estimated as:

Table V shows that ∆Vpk,max, ∆Vrms,avg, and ∆Tset,max were smaller 
for the proposed strategy than for the conventional strategies. 
The improvement in real-time VR was principally because the 
proposed  FVCs  allowed  the  DGs  to  respond  faster,  more 
robustly, and more accurately to upcoming voltage deviations 
caused by NR (see Fig. 10(c)), including when the errors in DG 
and load parameter estimates were large. Fig. 10(d) shows that 
the  active  power  output  profiles  of  DGs  afforded  by  the 
proposed and conventional strategies were similar. This implies 
that  the  proposed  strategy  can  also  be  reliably  applied  to  the 
self-healing of islanded microgrids.

C. Performance in the Self-healing Scenario 

Additional  case  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the 
proposed  VR  strategy  with  variations  over  time  in  the  load 
demand and photovoltaic (PV) power generation [33], [34] (see 
Fig. 11). The optimal FVCs were developed by reference to the 
base load demand (i.e., SL = 2.6 + j1.2 MVA). The differences 
between  actual  and  base  load  demands  were  reflected  as 
uncertainties in the network parameter estimates, in addition to 
uncertainties in the estimates of KA, Lf, and Sr. Fig. 12 shows the 
profiles  of  VDG,  VLoad,  QDG,  and  PDG  from  T0  to  T5  in  the 
scenario.  In  Cases  1  and  2,  ∆VDG  and  ∆VLoad  remain 
significantly lower at all time periods, compared with Cases 3 
and 4, because the optimal FVCs enabled faster and preemptive 
control of DGs in response to SW operations, thus allowing the 
existing  feedback  control  loops  to  better  compensate  for  the

remaining  ∆VDG.  By  contrast,  in  the  conventional  strategies, 
DG power outputs were controlled only by the feedback loops; 
they  came  into  effect  after  ∆VDG  was  already  significantly 
changed by NR. Moreover, Table VI numerically compares the 
proposed and conventional strategies. For Case 2, ∆Vrms,avg and 
∆Vpk,max  were  52.3  and  51.9%,  respectively,  smaller  than  in 
Case 4; whereas Σi∆QSGi,rms and Σk∆QIGk,rms were only 4.6 and 
7.6%, respectively, larger than in Case 4. This implies that the 
costs incurred by the increased operational stress on SGs and 
IGs can be adequately compensated by the savings attributable 
to the improved VR during load restoration. 

D. Sensitivity Analysis for a Communication Time Delay 

The case studies discussed in Section V-C were repeated to 
analyze the sensitivity of the proposed VR strategy with respect 
to Td. Uncertainties in the estimates of KA, Lf, Sr, and SL were 
maintained  for  Cases  2  and  4.  Fig.  13(a)  shows  the  ratios  of 
∆Vrms,avg of the proposed strategy to those of the conventional 
strategies,  when  Td  ranged  from  0.1  to  0.6  s,  as  discussed  in 
Section IV-B. Similarly, Fig. 13(b) shows the ratios of ∆Vpk,max 
values of the proposed and conventional strategies with respect 
to Td. For all Td, the ratios of both ∆Vrms,avg and ∆Vpk,max remain 
smaller  than  1.0,  confirming  that  the  proposed  strategy  more 
effectively and robustly reduces bus voltage deviations. This is 
also consistent with the small-signal analysis results of Fig. 7. 

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 

This paper proposed a new VR strategy for a reconfigurable 
DN  wherein  optimal  robust  FVCs  enable  SGs  and  IGs  to 
respond faster and preemptively to real-time voltage deviations 
caused  by  NR-aided  load  restoration.  Real-time  voltage 
deviations  at  DG  terminal  buses  were  estimated  using  a 
dynamic  analytical  model  of  a  reconfigurable  DN,  and  then 
integrated into a robust optimization problem when designing 
the  optimal  FVCs.  The  problem  was  formulated  to  minimize 
voltage  deviations  with  respect  to  the  H∞  norm  while 
considering uncertainties in the estimates of the DG and load 
parameters. The results of small-signal analysis confirmed the 
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy in terms 
of  attenuating  low-frequency  components  of  bus  voltage 
deviations.  The  case  studies  also  revealed  that  the  proposed 
strategy  more  effectively  reduced  the  rms  and  peak-to-peak 
variations  in  bus  voltages  under  various  grid  conditions, 
compared  with  conventional  strategies  using  the  PI-based 
feedback controller and the robust feedback controller.

APPENDIX 

A.  Modeling a Reconfigurable Network  

The relationship between the real-time dq-axis bus voltages 

and injection currents in the steady-state is:  

I0 = YB∙V0. 

(A1) 

After NR is initiated, (A1) changes to:  

(A2) 
I0 + ΔI(t) = YA∙(V0 + ΔV(t)), 
where ΔV(t) and ΔI(t) are the variations in the dq-axis voltages 
and currents, respectively, in the transient state. From (A1) and 
(A2), ΔI(t) can be represented as: 

(A3) 
ΔI(t) = YA∙ΔV(t) + ΔIT(t), 
where ΔIT(t) = ΔY(t)∙V0 and ΔY(t) = (YA – YB)∙u(t). Note that 
NR  is  considered  to  be  a  discrete  variation  in  the  admittance 
matrix (i.e., from YB to YA), leading to the step variation ΔIT(t) 
that arises immediately after the DN topology changes. 

In  addition,  considering  the  outputs  of  the  FVCs,  the 
dynamics of the SGs and IGs can be represented in aggregated 
form as: 

 ΔX
ΔIDG(t)  = CX∙ΔXDN(t) – DV∙ΔV(t), 

DN(t) = AX∙ΔXDN(t) + BV∙ΔV(t) + BDG∙ΔUFF(t),  (A4) 
(A5) 
where the coefficient matrices are obtained from the linearized 
expressions  for  the  SG  and  IG  models  [23].  Moreover,  the 
voltage-dependent loads can be modeled as: 

(A6) 
ΔIL(t) = DL∙ΔV(t), 
where DL is a block diagonal matrix, the elements of which are 
determined  based  on  the  ZIP coefficients  [23].  Using  ΔI(t)  = 
ΔIDG(t)  +  ΔIL(t),  a  dynamic  model  of  the  reconfigurable  DN 
can be established by substituting (A5) and (A6) into (A3), as: 
(A7) 
ΔV(t) = Z∙(CX∙ΔXDN(t) − ΔIT(t)), 
where Z = (YA + DV − DL)–1. Using (A4) and (A7), the dyna- 
mics of ΔXDN can then be expressed in a state-space form as: 

  ΔX

DN(t) = ADN∙ΔXDN(t) + BDG∙ΔUFF(t) + BNR·u(t),  (A8) 
where ADN = AX + BV∙Z∙CX and BNR = −BV∙Z∙(YA – YB)∙V0. In 
(A8), ΔXDN includes ΔVSGi and ΔVIGk as: 

ΔVDG(t) = CDG∙ΔXDN(t), 

(A9) 

where CDG contains only zeros and ones.
