Abstract

The subject of this paper is the empirically determined anomalous
secular increases of the astronomical unit, of the order of some cm yr−1,
and of the eccentricity of the lunar orbit, of the order of 10−12 yr−1.
The aim is to ﬁnd an empirical explanation of both the anomalies, as far
as their orders of magnitude are concerned. The methods employed are
working out perturbatively with the Gauss equations the secular eﬀects
on the semi-major axis a and the eccentricity e of a test particle orbiting
a central body acted upon by a small anomalous radial acceleration
A proportional to the radial velocity vr of the particle-body relative
motion. The results show that non-vanishing secular variations

and
occur. If the magnitude of the coeﬃcient of proportionality of
the extra-acceleration is of the same order of magnitude of the Hubble
10−11 yr−1 at the present epoch, they are
parameter H0 = 7.47
able to explain both the astrometric anomalies without contradicting
other existing observational determinations for the Moon and the other
planets of the solar system. Finally, it is concluded that the extra-
acceleration might be of cosmological origin, provided that the relative
radial particle-body motion is accounted for in addition to that due to
the cosmological expansion only. Anyway, further data analyses should
conﬁrm or disproof the existence of both the astrometric anomalies as
genuine physical phenomena.

Introduction

Recently, the main features of the anomalous secular increases of both the
astronomical unit and the eccentricity e of the lunar orbit have been reviewed
[1]. While the ﬁrst eﬀect, obtained by several independent researchers [2,
1, the second one [6, 7]
3, 4, 5, 1], should be of the order of a few cm yr−
1, according to the latest data analysis
amounts to ˙e = (9
[8].

Such phenomena attracted the attention of various scientists dealing with
them in diﬀerent contexts [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
Thus, several more or less sound attempts to ﬁnd, or to rule out, possible
explanations [2, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
37, 38, 39, 40, 1, 41, 42, 43] for both the anomalies were proposed so far,
both in terms of standard known gravitational physical phenomena and of
long-range modiﬁed models of gravity.

Here we propose an empirical formula which is able to accommodate both

the anomalies, at least as far as their orders of magnitude are concerned.

2 An anomalous acceleration proportional to the

radial velocity of the test particle

Let us assume that, in addition to the usual Newtonian inverse-square law
for the gravitational acceleration imparted to a test particle by a central
body orbited by it, there is also a small radial extra-acceleration of the form

Apert = kH0vr.

The formulas in eq. (6), which were obtained by taking an average over a
full orbital revolution, are exact to all order in e.

Since eMoon = 0.0647, it turns out that eq. (6) is able to reproduce the
measured anomalous increase of the lunar orbit for 2.5 . k . 5. Moreover,
for such values of k eq. (6) yields an increase of the lunar semi-major axis

3 Conclusions

Here we do not intend to speculate too much about possible viable physical
mechanisms yielding the extra-acceleration of3 eq. (1).

It might be argued that, reasoning within a cosmological framework,
the Hubble law may give eq.
(1) for k = 1 if the proper motion of the
particle about the central mass is taken into account in addition to its purely
cosmological recession which, instead, yields the well-known local4 extra-
acceleration of tidal type [46, 25, 47]

is the deceleration parameter at the present

On the other hand, our empirical results, which are not in contrast with
other observational determinations for the Moon and the other planets of the
solar system, may be simply interpreted, in a purely phenomenological way,
in terms of a radial extra-acceleration proportional to the radial component

2Actually, the astronomical unit is neither the semi-major axis of the Earth’s orbit
nor its average distance from the Sun hri = a(1 + e2/2) [3]. On the other hand, it is
a⊕ = 1.00000018 au (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/p elem t2.txt).

modiﬁed Newtonian dynamics.

vr of the proper velocity of the test particle about its primary through a
1 and a magnitude close to that of
coeﬃcient having the dimensions of T−
H0: its physical origin should not necessarily be of cosmological origin.

Finally, we want to spend some words about the nature of the anomalies
considered. As it was shown, the anomalous increase of the astronomical
unit has attracted the attention of several researchers so far. It was deter-
mined as a solve-for parameter by using diﬀerent ephemerides which neither
use the same dynamical force models nor the same observational records.
Further processing of more extended data sets, with more accurate dynam-
ical modeling, will be useful in shedding further light on such an anomaly.
The authors of Ref. [1] conclude their review of the anomalous variation of
the astronomical unit by writing at pag. 194: “If the reported increase holds
up under further scrutiny and additional data analysis, it is indeed anoma-
lous. Meanwhile it is prudent to remain skeptical of any real increase. In our
opinion the anomalistic increase lies somewhere in the interval zero to 20 cm
1 , with a low probability that the reported increase is a statistical false
yr−
alarm.” On the other hand, it must be remarked that a clear deﬁnition for
the change of the astronomical unit is still lacking since some researchers be-
lieve that the astronomical unit is a redundant unit, like to the gravitational
parameter GM of the Sun, which should, instead, be empirically determined
from data processing as a solve-for parameter [48, 49, 50]. It is likely that
at the IAU meeting in 2012 a ﬁxed numerical value for it will be adopted5.
Anyway, this would have the eﬀect of just shifting the detected anomaly to
another physical quantity. Concerning the Moon’s orbit, the ﬁrst report of
the lunar eccentricity anomaly dates back to 2001 [6]; such a phenomenon
is still here [7, 8], despite the increasing accuracy in LLR observations and
modeling occurred in the last decade due to the steady eﬀorts of a wide
community of researchers engaged in LLR science and technology. On the
other hand, it is not certainly unreasonable to expect that further modeling
of classical eﬀects occurring in the lunar interior may ﬁnally be able to ex-
plain the observed anomaly. Anyway, until it will actually happen, looking
for alternative explanations remains a task worth being pursued.
