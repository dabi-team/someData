We present a morphological and physical analysis of a giant molecular cloud (GMC) using
the carbon monoxide isotopologues (12CO, 13CO, C18O 3P2

Plane (Mopra CO Southern Galactic Plane Survey), supplemented with neutral carbon maps
from the HEAT telescope in Antarctica. The GMC structure (hereinafter the ring) covers
the sky region 332◦ < ℓ < 333◦ and b

In our Galaxy, as in other galaxies, the space between the stars
is ﬁlled by a faint medium that consists of ionized, atomic, and
molecular gas, high-energy particles (cosmic rays), and dust grains
at micron scales. Cosmic rays (CRs), magnetic ﬁelds, and the tur-
bulent motion of diffuse gas and dust grains, perturb the interstellar
medium (ISM) and contribute to it being inhomogeneously dis-
tributed at small scales. The molecular structures within the ISM
span a wide range of sizes and masses, from Bok globules (Bok &
Reilly 1947) of few solar masses on parsec scales (Clemens, Yun &

to immense giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with masses of the or-
der of 104–106 M

spanning tens of parsecs (Bally 1986).

Molecular clouds are the densest and coldest regions of the ISM.
Inside them, in regions where CRs, magnetic ﬁelds, and violent mo-
tions of gas are unable to provide support against gravitational col-
lapse, the molecular gas condenses to form new stars. The ionization
and turbulent feedback from the massive newborn stars photodis-
sociates and perturbs the surrounding gas, dissolving the hosting
molecular cloud as between 2 and 20 per cent of the original cloud
mass is converted into stars (Molinari et al. 2014).

The gas processed by the thermonuclear reactions in the interior
of the stars is recycled back into the ISM through mechanisms such
as stellar winds and supernova explosions. The injection of matter

and energy into the surrounding medium closes the Galactic ecology

gas reservoir with heavy elements and more complex molecules
ready to form a new generation of stars.

The typical time-scale of this cycle is about 5 –10

The detection of molecular hydrogen (Carruthers 1970) in the
far-UV spectrum of a hot star, and the detection of CO (Wilson,
Jefferts & Penzias 1970) as the second most abundant molecule in
space, started the era of systematic observation of the distribution
of interstellar molecules. Although molecular hydrogen is ubiqui-
tously present in the ISM, and is the primary component of GMCs,
it is extremely difﬁcult to directly observe. Its lowest transition en-
ergy (quadrupole J
0 line at 28.22 µm) is at 510 K above
ground (Dabrowski 1984), very far from the typical GMCs tempera-
tures (10–20 K; Goldsmith 1987). The carbon monoxide molecule,
having an almost constant relative abundance with respect to H2
(equal to

the ground level, is a good proxy for H2 in the environments of in-
terstellar clouds (Scoville & Sanders 1987). The empirical link be-
tween the measured quantity, the 12CO line ﬂux, and the H2 column
density is the Xco conversion factor (Dame, Hartmann & Thaddeus
2001; Shetty et al. 2011; Bolatto, Wolﬁre & Leroy 2013) which is
typically Xco ≈
Many experimental observations of the ISM distribution across
the Galactic Plane have been made and include the emission in var-

In the analysis performed in this paper, we will examine in detail
the general physical characteristics and the morphology of a GMC
recently discovered in the G332 region of the Galactic Plane, identi-
ﬁed using data from the Mopra CO Southern Galactic Plane Survey
(Braiding et al. 2018).

1.1 Paper structure

In this section, we will give a brief description of how we structured
our study. We start with a short presentation of our CO data and the
relative reduction pipeline (Section 2), followed by an overview of
the CO emission in the G332 sector and the molecular ring cloud
(Section 3.1), including how we inferred the cloud distance by solv-
ing the kinematic distance (KDA; Section 4). In Section 5.1, we de-
scribe the adopted data masking method for creating moment maps
(Section 5.1), and the derivation of the CO column density (Sec-
tion 6) assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) condi-
tions. The dust spectral energy distribution (SED) ﬁt and its relative

MNRAS 00, 1 (2019)

molecular hydrogen column density N(H2), relative to the molecu-
lar ring cloud, are described in Section 6.5. In order to investigate
the local variation of the Xco factor, in Section 7.1 we compare the
12CO integrated intensity map and N(H2) column density derived
from 13CO, at different Tex. Taking advantage of the availability of
[C I] line data, we deﬁne an X809
CI factor (Section 7.2) by comparing
the molecular hydrogen column density traced by 13CO and 12CO to
the [C I] integrated intensity. Moreover, we used the atomic carbon
emission, in combination with the 13CO detection, to quantify the
dark H2 gas not traced by carbon monoxide (Section 7) and anal-
yse how the [C I] /13CO ratio varies in the ring cloud (Section 8.3).
To further inspect the different conditions occurring in the cloud,
in Section 9 we describe how we identiﬁed clumps and report the
C18O principal physical properties in a catalogue (Table A1). In the
discussion section we analyse (Section 10.1) how we disentangled
the dust emission across the Galaxy with a spiral arm model, while
in Section 10.2 we examine the star formation activity ongoing in
the cloud. The relation between the measured Xco variation and
the physical conditions observed in the cloud are discussed in Sec-
tion 10.3, and in Sections 10.4and 10.5, we present ways in which
the different physical conditions of the cloud can be inspected using
other tracers from CO, such as [C I] and 8µm emission. We end our
study (Section 11), presenting new methods based upon virtual re-
ality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) techniques to visualize radio
astronomy data, we present three different VR/AR representations
in Appendix A.

To help localize the regions of the cloud, single objects, or speciﬁc
features, we will use the convention shown in Fig. 1. All the global
cloud quantities reported in the paper are derived from the region
resulting by the union of [SE-R], [SW-R], [W-R], [NW-R], [N-R],
and [C-R], if not otherwise stated.

by the Spitzer space telescope.7 On the longer wave-
length side, to derive the cold dust emission temperature proﬁle,
we considered the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-

purpose. In addition, we use the Galactic coordinate grid as reference: from
A to F for Galactic longitude and from 1 to 6 for Galactic latitude, both
in steps of 0.15◦, for a total of 6

sector; for example, the H II region in [N-R] will be indicated as [C2-

grey, is a superposition between the North–East extremity of the molecular
ring and gas that seems to come from the direction of the RCW106 cloud
and is not directly connected to the CO ring. The astrophysical objects are

In Fig. 6 we present the Galactic spiral arms overplotted with the
Position Velocity (PV) image of the 12CO average emission from the
region shown in Fig. 1. It is seen that most of the CO is constrained
inside the Norma near, Norma far, and Scutum-Crux near arms,
while in the Sagittarius near and Scutum-Crux arms, there are only
a few small clouds. The position ambiguity between Scutum-Crux
near and Norma far is clearly visible as they are superimposed.

degrading the spectral resolution to

CO and [C I] we used a boxcar kernel width of [3,3,2] voxels:
the average is computed considering three voxels in each angular
direction and two along the spectral axis. The rms noise of the
smoothed cube, σ s, is used to select only voxels above a σ det =
φdet threshold. The selection is then expanded including all
σ s ×
φext level. This grow-
the surrounding voxels above the σ ext =
ing mask procedure is similar to the masking method used in the
CPROPS algorithm (Rosolowsky & Leroy 2006). Both the selec-
tion and the expansion steps are done on the smoothed cube. All
voxels that pass these two criteria form the mask applied to the
original cube to compute the moment maps. For 12CO, 13CO, and
C18O the chosen masking threshold values are [6,3], written in the
form [φdet, φext]. In this paper we will always refer to this kind of
3D mask coming from a four-channel binned datacube (specify-
ing from which line originates), if not otherwise stated. The same
values of smoothing and threshold are used for [C I] and HI. In
Fig. 4 are shown the resulting moment maps for CO and [CI]. We
opted a boxcar instead of a Gaussian smooth after performing a

Inspection of the CO spectral line and the sigma threshold masks
(see Section 5.1) led us to focus our study on Galactic coordinates
332.0 < ℓ < 332.8,
0.3 < b < 0.4, within which we identiﬁed the
principal emission structure (the ring), and on the velocity range
1 (which we refer to as the ring velocity
−
range). This choice was made to prevent contamination coming
from gas not evidently connected to the ring or with a very low
signal-to-noise ratio.11 The extent deﬁned above is the same used
to compute moment maps (as the moment zero in Fig. 4) and all the
plots belonging to the ring, unless otherwise speciﬁed.

0.15◦ (see Fig. 1), where the North–East extremity of the ring and
another cloud extremity coming from the East fall in the same ring
VLSR range, is excluded from our study, since the two clouds cannot
be clearly separated.

Taking into account the above mentioned constraints, the ring
angular dimensions are about 0.8◦ along both South–North and
East–West directions, showing mean velocity FWHMs approxi-

series of tests applying a custom genetic algorithm (Holland 1992)
to ﬁnd the best combination of the two threshold and two smoothing
parameters.

To simplify the description of this algorithm we will take ad-
vantage of terms usually used in genetics. The algorithm basically
creates a certain number (population) of moment map individuals
from a different choice of the above mentioned four parameters
(four genes or genotype), randomly selected from a deﬁned range.
To each map (individual) is assigned a score through a custom
deﬁned function (ﬁtness function). In our deﬁnition the best indi-
viduals have the higher ﬁtness function. This function takes into
account the number of voxels with negative values included in the
3D mask, the number of voxels of the mask, the number of nega-
tive and positive pixels in the ﬁnal zeroth moment map. In detail,
the ﬁtness function is deﬁned as fﬁt =
−
V−)/VN, where P+ and P− are, respectively, the number of positive
and negative value pixels in the resulting 2D zeroth moment map,
while V+, V−, and VN are, respectively, the number of positive, neg-

ative, and total voxels included in the 3D mask. The major weight
given to P−, with respect to P+, is to greatly decrease the ﬁtness
function for individuals having negative value pixels in the ﬁnal
zeroth moment map. As a consequence, these individuals will have
minimal chances of passing their genotype to the next generation.
The parameters (genotype) of the elements of the population with
the best score are mixed together (crossover) to create a new set
of parameters (sons genotype) introducing a small mutation (muta-
tion), thus creating a second generation of the parameter set. When
the maximum value of the ﬁtness function does not change for a
certain number of iterations, prior to stopping the process, the al-
gorithm increases the variation in the sons parameters (mutation
ampliﬁcation) for a maximum number of iterations, in order to pre-
vent the algorithm stopping on a local maximum, exploring a wider
parameter space. If a new individual is found the process continues
with the mutation rate set to the initial value.

The integrated ﬂux coming from the masked cubes was found to
be the 51, 70, and 55 per cent of the integrated ﬂux coming from

emission in the smoothed cube is below the masking threshold while
13CO is above. Examining the line proﬁle (Fig. 7) this behaviour
can be explained as 12CO self-absorption, since the local minimum
of the 12CO spectral lines is close to the 13CO and C18O local peaks.
However, a deeper inspection of all the ring 12CO spectra reveals
that this effect is limited to few lines of sight, mainly distributed in
the Northern part of the ring, besides the above mentioned region.

5.2 Integrated intensity

Integrated intensity maps of [C I] and all CO lines are shown in
Fig. 4. All the lines show the ring shape, with 12CO, 13CO, and [C I]
being most similar in shape. Thicker structures seen in C18O are
distributed along an arc-like structure interrupted by a few cavities.
Here we will brieﬂy describe the main features:

(i) 12CO, 13CO, and [C I] are higher in [C-R], [SE-R], and
[SW-R]. The ﬁrst region covers a system of multiple bub-
bles [CPA2006] S52 that encloses [CPA2006] S53, and

diffuse 24µm emission and no signiﬁcant C18O detection.

possible to see regions in which there is no 12CO counterpart of 13CO
emission, in particular around (ℓ, b)
(332.3◦, 0.2◦). This apparent

([SE-R]) as well as dense cores ([SW-R]). The [N-R] shows lower
emission, but as in the southern regions there are some YSO candi-
dates (see Fig 1).

The major contribution to the overall ring emission comes from
the southern ring that seems to hosts more sites of star formation
activity (see Section 10.2) compared to [N-R], [NW-R], and [W-R]
regions. As expected, among all the CO lines, 12CO emission is
the most widespread. The apparent absence of 12CO emission in
[NW-R] where 13CO is present is explained in Section 5.1.

tral lines indicate a dip in the 12CO emission in correspondence of
a 13CO peak, a scenario compatible with 12CO self-absorption.

Comparing the ﬁrst (Fig. 8) and the second moment maps (Fig. 9)
it is possible to identify, for all the spectral lines except C18O, sharp
value changes in [D4] and [D6]. This can be explained as a partial
superimposition of cloud fragments detected at a VLSR greater than
the main ring VLSR . The second moment maps (Fig. 9) show a
pattern in [SW-R] that conﬁrms this interpretation: an increase in
the velocity dispersion where the ﬁrst moment maps are suggesting
the superposition between the fragments and the ring emission. The
same explanation applies to 12CO in [D1], where both the ﬁrst and
second moment maps show a sharp change in value. In this case,
the 12CO emission of the ring cloud is extended towards lower
velocities.

To better understand the physical connection between these
extensions and the main ring, we made use of VR and AR
representations10 (described in Appendix A), which allows us to
consider them as part of the ring complex.

In order to take in account the response of the Mopra radio telescope,
the measured signal (T ∗A ) was converted into the corrected brightness
temperature TMB, using the extended beam efﬁciency ηxb =
0.55
at 115 GHz (Ladd et al. 2005), since the sources considered in this

MNRAS 00, 1 (2019)

work are more extended than the Mopra main beam. The HEAT
datacube is in Tmb. In Fig. A1 we report the column density maps
derived for 13CO, C18O, and [C I] using different Tex values. Our
approach to derive 12CO, 13CO, C18O, and [C I] column densities
is based on assuming LTE conditions, and same LTE temperature
for all the CO isotopologues. It is important to note that the latter
assumption is not veriﬁed in the presence of temperature gradients.
Besides LTE conditions, we considered a beam ﬁlling factor
equal to unity, optically thick 12CO, and optically thin 13CO and
C18O emissions. The last hypothesis was veriﬁed by inspecting
voxel-by-voxel the C18O/13CO ratio, which was found to be in the
range [0.2–0.25] in regions where the C18O is bright enough to yield
a signiﬁcant ratio value within the noise level. It is important to note
that this ratio depends also on the oxygen 18O abundance relative
to 16O as well.

In the next paragraphs we describe in detail all the steps followed

to compute optical depth and column densities.

temperature (Tmb) coming from a molecular cloud by the equation
of radiative transfer:

approaches in the derivation of excitation temperature. In the ﬁrst,
we considered a constant Tex for the whole ring, derived from the
12CO line, using different values of T12
MB ranging from 10 to 30 K in
steps of 10 K (good approximations to the minimum, median, and
maximum main 12CO brightness temperature in the ring velocity
range). The choice of a constant Tex was adopted to verify that a
change in the Tex (e.g. a factor of 2, from 10 to 20 K) does not
greatly affect the resulting column density. In the second approach,
we computed a speciﬁc Tex for each line of sight in two different
ways: from the T12
MB peak map (Fig. 10) and from the dust temper-
ature map (see Section 6.5 and Fig. 11). We note that in the case
10 K, for few voxels the optical depth equation (equa-
of Tex =

of the lines along the ring. We used a different velocity interval

approach we assumed that the gas traced by dust is all in molecular
form, and this may not be true in the external layers of the clouds
or in high radiation ﬁeld regions.

In order to seek a correlation between N(H2) dust and total CO

plot between these two quantities. Depending on the correlation
between N(H2) dust and 13CO integrated intensity, two groups of
points were identiﬁed: the red ellipse group (A) possesses an higher
correlation compared to the black ellipse group (B). The linear ﬁt
overlaid on the scatter plot is computed on group A points only. In
doing so, we are assuming N(H2) traced by 13CO is proportional to

In the surface layer of molecular clouds FUV radiation photodisso-
ciates CO to atomic carbon and ionized carbon (C+), whereas H2 is
able to self-shield due to its higher abundance; thus the H2 not traced
by CO is traced instead by [C I] emission (Wolﬁre, Hollenbach &
McKee 2010). To quantify this dark molecular gas fraction of H2
not traced by CO we compared column densities coming from CO
and [C I], NCO, and NCI, respectively, considering as the dark gas
fraction the quantity

NCI/(NCO +

fDG =
To derive NCO we converted the 13CO column density into total
CO column density applying the same isotopic abundance ratio
[12CO/13CO]
53 derived in equation (6) for the assumed ring
Galactocentric distance of 5.5 kpc. We computed two fDG pixel-
by-pixel maps (see Fig. 16) which differ only for the value of Tex
(10 or 20 K) used to calculate NCO, while for NCI we used a ﬁxed
30 K. All column densities were derived applying the same
Tex =
3D mask to both [C I] and CO datacubes. The 13CO datacube was
regridded to the [C I] resolution and then used to compute the 3D
mask to compare their emissions.

Examining the images, in Fig. 16 further we see that, in gen-
eral, the dark gas fraction possesses lower values on lines of sights
passing through the innermost part of the molecular cloud, while
increasing towards the edges of the CO ring. In particular, the lowest
values are located in [NW-R]. This is consistent with an increased
fraction of dark gas in molecular cloud surfaces where CO is pho-
todissociated.

20 K than at Tex =
20 K is 16 per cent, while at Tex =

Since column density increases almost linearly with the assumed
Tex (for excitation temperatures above the energy of the considered
emission line), we found lower fDG values for NCO computed at
10 K. In particular the average fDG at
Tex =
10 K it is 18 per cent.
Tex =
The latter is similar to the fDG computed assuming a Tex derived
from the 12CO peak temperature map (Fig. 10). The molecular dark
gas fraction decreases if we instead assume [C I] Tex =
50 K. In
this case the average fDG values are equal to 10 per cent for a CO
10, 20 K, or derived from the 12CO peak temperature map.
Tex =
Comparing with other estimates, our average values are nearly half
of the value estimated in Burton et al. (2015), which gave a value
30 per cent for the average dark molecular gas fraction, for a
of
cold quiescent molecular cloud in G328.

7.1 Xco factor

We inferred the Xco factor by comparing the 12CO integrated in-
tensity map with the N(H2) map obtained from 13CO computed at
different Tex. In the derivation of these maps, we adopt for the 3D
mask the intersection of the single 3D masks coming from 12CO
and 13CO (see Section 5.1), in order to ensure comparison of the
emission from the same voxels.

In Fig. 20 is shown the ratio between integrated intensity map of

increasing towards the cloud edge respect to innermost regions, in
which it assumes values in the range [2–4]. A small region located
(332.3◦, 0.2◦), shows a ratio <1; this could

8.3 [C I]/13CO ratio

The C abundance is expected to increase in the external layers of
GMCs where the FUV radiation dissociates the CO, so that the
[CI]/CO ratio may be greater than in the innermost parts of the
cloud. To investigate the [CI]/13CO in the ring we regrid the 13CO
cube to the [C I] coarser resolution and applied to both the same
[C I] 3D mask. In Fig. 21 we present the integrated intensity maps
ratio between [C I] and 13CO.

The ratio between the zeroth moment maps possess values <1
along almost all the lines of sight passing through the thickest
region of the molecular ring, with lower peaks in [NW-R] and [N-
R]. Ratio values are >1 at the edge of the cloud subregions [SE-R],
[SW-R], [C-R], and [N-R], although here 13CO detection drastically
decreases, lowering the signal-to-noise level and making pixels less
distinguishable. Interestingly, some sections of the ring edge have a
ratio <1, in [NW-R], in eastern [C2] and around (ℓ, b)
(332.25◦,
0.0◦).

To better characterize the ratio values dispersion, we explore the

Since C18O emission is generally weak, due to the low isotopic
abundance ratio compared to 12CO and 13CO, its detection is mostly
likely to be optically thin. This makes the C18O line a probe through
the entire molecular clouds column, sensitive in particular to the
highest column density regions, when 13CO (and even more so
12CO), is optically thick. In order to investigate the highest column
density clumps within the molecular ring, we decomposed it ap-
plying the CLUMPFIND algorithm (Williams, de Geus & Blitz 1994)
to the C18O emission cube, binned and smoothed in the same way
as in moment maps computation (see Section 5.1). We limited our
analysis to the ring velocity range; however an expansion of this
work, performed on 10◦ of the Galactic Plane binned C18O dat-
acube, is presented in Braiding et al. (2018). After a series of tests
we selected the value of 0.35 K, equivalent to 3.5σ , for both input
parameters inc and low. We set a threshold of 10 voxels on the

for false detection comparing C18O and 13CO spectral lines passing
through each clump centroid. To avoid false detection of a single
clump as two distinct clumps we set a minimum centroid distance
equal to seven voxels; all the clumps passed this veriﬁcation step.

In the following sections we will describe a method, based on the
13CO emission, to separate dust emission across the Galactic spiral
arms, giving an estimate of the total mass traced by dust through the
ring region. We will also discuss the different physical conditions in
the cloud and how these suggest a scenario in which the molecular
structure shows different evolutionary stages: quiescent clouds in
which star formation is occurring at its earliest stage or not yet
initiated, and active clouds in which star formation is ongoing at
a later stage. In doing so, we will compare the C18O with Hi-Gal
clumps associated with the G332 ring cloud.

10.1 Dust across the Galaxy

As discussed in Section 6.5, the overall N(H2) derived from the dust
emission is the sum of all contributions along the line of sight. To
compare it to N(H2) traced by the 13CO we ﬁrst consider Fig. 14,
relating dust column to 13CO line ﬂux. There are two sets of point
here, one (group A) showing a linear correlation, the other (B) not.
The former demonstrates the link between ﬂux and column den-
sity for most regions, which we now decompose into contributions
coming from separate spiral arms along the line of sight.

We note that in the N(H2) column density traced by dust (Fig. 13,
which comprises all infrared emission from this region) it is possible
to ﬁnd, to ﬁrst approximation, a coherency between the dust and
13CO and 12CO integrated ﬂux (Fig. 4). In particular, as shown in
Fig. 13, in [SE-R] and [SW-R] 13CO integrated ﬂux peaks are close
to dust column peaks. The West side of the ring, [W-R], and part
of [NW-R], present low integrated CO emission while the dust is
bright. Bright dust, in general, follows the ring, a likely consequence
of it arising from the region too. However, focusing on the ring CO
and dust emission, we need to separate dust related to different
Galactic spiral arms. In the following we describe our approach.

According to the average CO spectral line proﬁle and following
the spiral arm scheme adopted in this paper (Fig. 5), we separated
the 13CO emission into four velocity ranges (R1, R2, R3, and R4),
choosing the near or far solution coherently with any H I emission
local minimum (see Fig. 3):

This scheme follows the position velocity (PV) plot of Fig. 6. We
excluded 13CO emission coming from
1 since it is
localized in small structures and its integrated intensity is negligible
with respect to other velocity intervals. To separate the dust emission
coming from each of the spiral arms we computed, following the
method of Section 5.2, for each velocity interval, a 13CO pixel-by-
pixel moment zero map normalized to the total integrated intensity

of which is subsequently multiplied by the N(H2) derived from dust
SED ﬁt (Fig. 13). In this way we created four different N(H2) dust
maps (see Fig. 25 one for each spiral arm). Our approach is based
on two assumptions that N(H2) traced by 13CO is proportional to
13CO integrated intensity and that the emission from dust coming
from regions where there is no CO emission is negligible (see
below for H I contributions). Thus, we are able to compare a directly

10.2 Star formation activity along the molecular ring

The overview image in Fig. 1 shows the Southern side of the ring
hosting several signposts of star formation with activity (masers
and H II regions) counterpoised a less active Northern side. In order
to investigate this difference we compared the C18O clumps distri-
bution (reported in Table A1) to the compact sources distribution
taken from the Hi-GAL catalogue (Elia et al. 2017) classiﬁed for
different stages of star evolution.

The Hi-GAL sources (hereafter called dust clumps) selected for
our analysis have coordinates that fall inside the C18O clumps el-
lipsoid extension (with semi-axis deﬁned by $ℓ and $b FWHMs
derived by clumpﬁnd), and a near distance solution between 3 and
4 kpc. In order to avoid the exclusion of sources not satisfying these
criterion, but potentially linked to the molecular ring, we included
all the dust clumps that totally (or partially) fall in the portion of sky
covered by the angular extension of the C18O integrated intensity
map (see Fig. 23). The total mass of all the dust clumps considered

average temperatures and in velocity dispersion, while those relative
to the Northern cloud show lower values for the same quantities.
These factors suggest a difference in the star formation activity
along the cloud: the dust cores in the Southern ring exhibits (on
average) hotter temperatures suggesting that star formation activity
is going on, while the Northern cores, colder, indicate that the star
formation has not yet started, or at an earlier stage.

10.3 Local Xco variation

12CO (J
0) emission is often used in the determination of the
N(H2), and total molecular mass, through the use of the Xco factor,
especially for extra-Galactic sources. Thus, it is important to under-
stand how the physical conditions of the emitting gas contribute to
any variation in the X factor. Considering the cloud distance and the
pixel dimension of 30 arcsec we are able to examine Xco variations
on parsec scales (at

0.5 pc).

The approach of our Xco analysis uses equation (7), where N(H2)
is traced by 13CO under different Tex assumptions, or N(H2) traced
by dust. As shown in Section 7.1, the average Xco is found to
increase with the assumed Tex used to derive the column density.

12CO spectral lines, where the Xco is higher, show lower 12CO
intensity compared to ring average, as does 13CO as well, and in
general present a non-Gaussian spectrum proﬁle. In many cases,
12CO is self-absorbed, while 13CO and C18O peak at the 12CO local
minimum (as shown in Fig. 7).

Local decrease in intensity of the 12CO/13CO ratio (Fig. 20)
corresponds to higher Xco factor (Fig. 18), where the 12CO/13CO
ratio is lowest, the CO is most optically thick and the Xco is highest.
This is not unexpected since, by deﬁnition, our Xco map derives
from the ratio between N(H2) traced by 13CO (proportional to 13CO
integrated intensity through the optical depth integration; see equa-
tions 4 and 5) and 12CO integrated intensity. These optically thickest
regions show signiﬁcant decrease in 12CO emission with respect to
13CO.

which star formation could occur. We used as Mclumps both pre- and

The Lbol/Mclump ratio is a useful indicator of the star formation
activity ongoing in the hosting clump (Molinari et al. 2008; Elia &
Pezzuto 2016). In order to examine the star formation activity along
the molecular ring, in Fig. 27 we plot the Lbol/Mclump and Tclump
values of the dust clumps following the path deﬁned from the [E,SE-
R] to the northern part of [C-R] (see Fig. 23).

The highest dust clump temperatures are in the Southern ring,
as well as the highest Lbol/Mclump ratios, both decrease following
the path. The C18O clumps corresponding to the Southern ring (as
reported in Table A1) exhibit in mean, higher values in 13CO, C18O

MNRAS 00, 1 (2019)

To further investigate the physical conditions underlying the ob-
served Xco distribution (Fig. 19), we looked at the variation of Tex
around the molecular ring. In Fig. 28 are shown the scatter plots
of Tex versus Xco for each sub-region of the cloud. The Tex value
was derived from the 12CO peak temperature for each sight line,
while the Xco was computed by using the N(H2) traced by 13CO,
assuming in the 13CO column density a Tex derived from the dust
temperature computed by the SED ﬁt (see Section 6.5). In Table 8
are summarized the Xco and Tex mean values for each region.

Examining Fig. 28 we note a general decrease in the dispersion
of Xco values, moving from [N-R] towards [SE-R], while Tex in-
creases. This behaviour in Tex is similar to the temperatures and
Lbol/Mclump ratio trend observed in the dust clumps (Fig. 23) and is
consistent with a stellar evolution gradient scenario: the Southern
cloud hosts active and more evolved star formation sites, which heat
the surrounding gas so increasing its temperature. On the contrary,
the Northern cloud hosts less and, on average, earlier stage star for-
mation sites, the gas is colder compared to the South and the peak

Supporting a scenario in which the Southern cloud is more active
than the Northern, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the literature reports many
indicators of star formation activity, as H II regions (see Section 5.2)
and masers, localized in the Southern ring: 6 GHz methanol maser
(Caswell et al. 2010), water maser (Walsh et al. 2014), class I
methanol maser at 36 and 49 GHz (Voronkov et al. 2014), and
95 GHz maser (Yang et al. 2017).

Recently Kong et al. (2015) reported for the California Molecular
Cloud high Xco values dispersion for cold quiescent regions and
an inverse correlation between Xco and Tex. They argued that this
correlation could explain the range of Xco values, found for different
GMCs, as a consequence of the different amount of warm gas heated
by OB stars in the cloud. The G332 molecular cloud presents similar
behaviour, where the coldest parts of the cloud show the most
scattering and highest Xco values and the lowest Tex, while the
most active regions show the opposite behaviour.

10.4 [C I]

The UV radiation coming from the massive young stars photodis-
sociates the surrounding gas, creating a PhotoDissociation Region
(PDR), where the carbon is mainly in atomic form, in neutral or
singly ionized state (Tielens & Hollenbach 1985; van Dishoeck &
Black 1988); similarly, the external layer of molecular clouds are
exposed to the diffuse far-UV radiation, photodissociating the CO
before it reaches a column density high enough to enable self-
shielding. To inspect the atomic carbon distribution around the
cloud, in Fig. 21 is illustrated the ratio between the integrated in-
tensities of [C I] and 13CO. As expected, the outskirts of the clouds
possess the highest ratio values, though with the lowest SNR. Inter-
estingly, [NW-R] and [W-R] present an exception: low ratio values
at the edge facing the North–West direction, while the edge to-
wards South–East presents higher values. Looking at the sightlines
passing through the innermost part of the cloud, the regions with
the lowest [CI]/13CO ratio values are [N-R], [NW-R], [E,SE-R],
and part of [W-R]. Proﬁles showing the ratio as a function of ve-
locity are in Fig. 29. They were derived from the [C I] and 13CO
(regridded to the [C I] resolution) datacubes, both masked using
the same [C I] 3D mask, the resulting proﬁles were then plotted
applying a Hanning smooth of order 3. The resulting picture is of
a northern ring, [N-R] and [NW-R], with mean ratio values of 0.3

external layer of the cloud. In [SW-R] (aperture D) the mean ratio

by star formation activity. Apertures A and C, belonging to the

where the 13CO emission increases. Regarding aperture E, we note

to increased radiation ﬁelds. We speculate that [NW-R] is the most
quiescent part of the cloud, and the difference between North and
South is driven by a star formation activity ongoing at a later stage
in [SW-R] and [SE-R], compared to [N-R], [NW-R], and [E,SE-R].
This further strengthens the hypothesis of a difference in the star
formation activity between northern and southern ring.

10.5 CO and 8 µm emission

IRDCs are regions in which the gas is cold and dense, absorbing
background IR emission. They provide suitable targets to look for
signposts of early star formation activity (Teyssier, Hennebelle &
P´erault 2002; Rathborne, Jackson & Simon 2006; Simon et al.
2006). The dust temperature map reported in Fig. 11 suggests that
the North–Western ring is the coldest region, thus it is likely to host
IRDCs. In Fig. 30 we plot the angular positions and equivalent radius
size of the IRDCs (red circles) identiﬁed by Peretto et al. (2016),
overlaid on the Xco map. Despite the coarser angular resolution of
the Xco, compared to the 16 arcsec Hi-GAL maps, it is possible
to see a spatial correlation between their positions and the angular
extent of the molecular cloud.

In Fig. 31 is shown the Spitzer 8µm image, in green contour
is the angular extension of the 13CO integrated intensity map, while
the red contours represents the dust temperature as per Fig. 11. We
note that the distribution of cores with lowest dust temperatures
precisely follow the extinction features seen in 8µm. Moreover,
0.1◦ < b < 0.3◦, an arc-like
between 332.3◦ < ℓ < 332.1◦ and
extinction feature is clearly seen, following the CO emission in
the sky portion deﬁned by northern [SW-R], [W-R], and [NW-R]
and southern [N-R]. The same correspondence between lowest dust
temperatures values and 8µm extinction is seen in [E,SE-R]. On
the other hand, the highest dust temperatures match the highest
8µm emission. We found correspondence between the distribution
of N(H2) traced by C18O and the extinction features (see Fig. 32),
also in [E,SE-R], and in small localized regions of the southern
cloud, i.e. (ℓ, b)
0.1◦), suggesting a strong correlation
between the IRDC position, the gas in the molecular cloud, and the
coldest dust.

Carbon monoxide depletion has been observed (Alves, Lada &
Lada 1999; Kramer et al. 1999; Kong et al. 2015) in dense and
cold regions. Thus, the cold and dense environment of IRDCs could
favour CO depletion caused by CO removal from gas phase due to
freeze out on to dust grains. It is important to note that could affect
the CO to dust comparison method presented in Section 10.1, which
was used to decompose the dust emission along the line of sight
across the Galaxy spiral arms, since we assumed that the dust and
CO emission are proportional. A consequence of the CO depletion
would be an underestimate of the dust content.

Comparing N(H2) traced by dust and N(H2) traced by C18O
to probe the densest regions of molecular cloud, we found the
distribution of N(H2) by C18O follows the IRDC position in the
Northern part of [SW-R], in [W-R] and [NW-R], as well as in

structure, we expect to observe a decreasing gradient in the Tex
from [SE-R] to [N-R], similar to that observed from the Southern
to Northern cloud (see Table 8).

Taking into account all these factors, we hypothesize that this
IRDC arc-like structure, and its extension in the souther ring, is
associated with the coldest and densest parts of the cloud, a unique
structure along which the star formation activity is at a later stage
in the southern ring than the northern ring. Considering [E,SE-R]
and [N-R] as the extremities of the IRDC, its length is

65 pc.

localized regions of the southern ring. In particular, in cold dust
regions (Fig. 33), we found an offset between the C18O N(H2)
peaks and dust N(H2) peaks, which could be an indication of CO
depletion in the highest column density dust regions.

The emission at 8 µm comes mainly from PAHs (Tielens & Hol-
lenbach 1985) excited by UV radiation from high-mass stars in
PDRs. The highest 8µm emission (in Fig. 31) are localized in [SW-
R], [SE-R], and [C-R] regions, where the CO spectral lines show
the highest emission peaks and the highest velocity dispersion. If
the gas in the molecular cloud and the IRDC are part of the same

In this section we present a new perspective for looking at astro-
nomical data, developed during the analysis of the G332 molecular
ring and applicable to other 3D surveys. The aim is to ﬁnd a visual-
ization method to better understand the distribution of CO data and
to perform an efﬁcient multiwavelength synergy with other surveys.
This is not only a data-driven problem but also a data visualization
issue, which we tried to solve by experimenting with the use of VR
and AR environments and applications.

Currently, the astronomy community is experiencing a growing
interest in AR/VR software and hardware to improve data visualiza-
tion and analysis (Ferrand, English & Irani 2016; Fluke & Barnes
2018). However, most of the software used by astronomers does
not offer advanced visualization tools, mainly because it was devel-
oped before the current available hardware, but also because its 3D
plot capabilities have limited user interaction. On the other hand,
the possibility given by VR/AR tools to literally ﬂy through data
sets dramatically improves the analysis process. Since our senses
evolved in a 3D world, a more intuitive data interpretation is likely
to occur in a 3D environment rather than in a 2D representation;
this is why immersive techniques have the potential to boost data

examination. We made use of VR/AR visualization in our data
CO investigation10 to discriminate between emissions related to the
main molecular ring structure (as in Section 5.3) and not. Standard
2D datacube plots (as moments maps or PV plots) could lead to
data misinterpretations, because of projection effects, while a 3D
immersive visualization could help showing data in a greater di-
mensional space. To solve the above ambiguity, we inspected 12CO,
13CO, and C18O emissions at different thresholds at the same time
(2σ , 3σ , 3.5σ , 4σ , and 4.5σ ). Such an amount of details is hard
to clearly represent on a standard 3D plot, restricting analysis to a
limited amount of information.

However, it is important to say that care is needed in PPV 3D
datacube inspection since the velocity (or spectral) dimension could
lead to misinterpretation in the analysis of the emission morphology
(as discussed in Clarke et al. 2018).

A digression on the limits of VR/AR application in astronomy
is beyond the purpose of this paper; they were analysed by Vogt &
Shingles (2013). Here we note that the continuous increase of com-
puting power, and the consequent increase in smartphone perfor-
mance, makes it possible to use complex software capable of achiev-
ing advanced results without increasing its complexity.

In Appendix A we describe in detail three examples of our VR
and AR visualization techniques. All of them are based on the same
initial step: convert the FITS format into another 3D format, which
can be easily read by VR (or AR) frameworks.

The spatial distribution of cold dust and C18O follows an arc-

We consider this extinction feature as an IRDC that is inside the
molecular ring. Along the IRDC we found that, in general, the peak
position of N(H2) traced by C18O present an offset position with
respect to N(H2) traced by dust peaks.

We concluded that the observed gas properties are inﬂuenced by
the stellar formation activity occurring along the identiﬁed IRDC,
which is an unique structure around which the molecular cloud is
wrapped. The path from [E,SE-R] to Southern [N-R] is
65 pc. We
found evidence of a different star formation activity between the
southern and northern ring.

A P P E N D I X A : H OW T O C R E AT E V R / A R
C O N T E N T F RO M F I T S DATAC U B E S

An example of our VR approach is the 13CO ring emission at
3σ level, presented in a web page we created based on WEBVR,19
using the WEBVR BOILERPLATE20 framework. It requires an IOS or
ANDROID device and a VR headset. We will now outline the three
steps required to create the VR version of the 13CO ring emission.
First step: Convert the FITS format to another 3D format. Using
a custom PYTHON routine based on the MAYAVI21 package, we ex-
tracted a portion of the 13CO 3D FITS radio datacube and converted
it to WRL22 3D format to make it compatible to other 3D software.
A 3D mesh is then created applying a sigma threshold (in this

case equal to 3σ ) on the extracted datacube section; this mesh is a
connected surface (isosurface) that comprises all the voxels whose
emission levels are above the threshold. It is important to note that
the mesh grid is the same of the starting FITS datacube.

Second step: the mesh in WRL format is converted to JSON 3D
format by using the 3D online editor CLARA.IO.23 In this way it
becomes readable by the JAVASCRIPT24 library THREE.JS.25 This step
is necessary to allow the reading of the 3D model by the WEBVR
BOILERPLATE, which uses THREE.JS library to create VR content.

Third step: web page creation, putting together HTML and
JAVASCRIPT code to conﬁgure the WEBVR environment, linking and
setting the 3D JSON model to THREE.JS JAVASCRIPT library. The ﬁ-
nal web page is at http://hologhost.altervista.org/VR/index.html. To
experience the best view we recommend the use of a pair of VR
headset and a smartphone or dedicated VR hardware. We tested it
on both IOS and ANDROID devices.

We veriﬁed the coherency between the 3D CO emission distribu-
tion, as in the original FITS datacube, and the ﬁnal mesh plotted by
THREE.JS in WEBVR environment. Comparing the mesh grid spac-
ing and the original emission distribution we found no discrepancy
between the two representations.

The limit of this method is the impossibility to move inside
the VR environment without using a dedicated controller. A so-
lution could be to change the point of view coordinates, but this
drastically decreases the interaction rapidity with the model. The
advantages are its accessibility and the use of non-proprietary
software.

An alternative we explored is based on the SKETCHFAB26 on-
line platform,27 which gives the possibility to inspect 3D models
both in VR or AR on mobile devices (both IOS or ANDROID with
VR headset) or on desktop PC equipped with VR hardware. This
solution is partially free, there is the possibility to choose between
a basic or paid accounts, the major difference is on the size limits of
the uploaded model. The advantage of this solution is the immediate
creation of cross-platform VR and AR environments without any
required coding. Here28 there is an AR/VR example of the C18O 3D
clumps distribution as reported in Section 9 and in Table A1. The
most interesting feature is the AR function accessible via mobile
app. In other words it is possible to virtually place the object on a
real detected surface and move around it as it is in the real world.
Here29 there is a fully navigable 3D representation (VR/AR mode)
of the molecular ring 4σ emission coming from all the three CO
isotopologues.

Another approach made use of the UNITY30 engine to build AR
IOS applications for both smartphones and tablets. Though giv-
ing details on the programming techniques used in this method-
ology is beyond the purpose of this paper, we report the prin-
cipal steps through which we created an application usable on
mobile devices alone or in combination with a mobile headset
system.

19WEBVR is an open project to create VR content accessible via the web
regardless of the used device; it requires a VR headset, an IOS, or ANDROID
mobile device with accelerometers, and a compatible browser: https://webv

Figure A1. Column densities map for as indicated in the header. With A and B are indicated the column densities derived at a [C I] resolution for an assumed
excitation temperature of 30 K. With D and C are indicated the column densities of C18O and 13CO, respectively, computed at the native CO resolution,
assuming a Tex derived from the 12CO peak temperature emission.

The ﬁrst step is necessarily the conversion of the FITS datacube
into a readable format for UNITY. We perform this step using the
same custom PYTHON routine above mentioned then converting the
mesh in OBJ31 or DAE32 3D format. The datacube is thus transformed
in a single (or multiple) mesh (depending on how the number of the
visualized isosurfaces) ready to be imported in UNITY. The VR (and
AR) capabilities we experimented with made use of the VUFORIA33
framework, which offers the possibility to create virtual buttons,
making possible to build virtual user interfaces through which we
interact with the model. The porting on mobile device can be done
in UNITY itself using the VUFORIA library, depending on the mobile
operating system. As expected, we found that the increment in the
complexity of the model dramatically slows the visualization expe-

rience on mobile devices, even though the meshes corresponding to
the 3σ emission of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O, coming from the G332
molecular ring, are easily displayed. Even though we tested this
technology on mobile devices, a full immersion visualization expe-
rience can be achieved only with dedicated hardware, overcoming
the limited computational constraints. On the other hand, the soft-

31http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/obj/
32https://www.khronos.org/collada/
33https://www.vuforia.com/
ware tools complexity is continuously decreasing, making easier
the creation of high-quality full immersion visualization solutions.
