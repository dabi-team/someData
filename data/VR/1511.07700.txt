Abstract Based on the data of multiple high-resolution R = 60000 observations obtained at the 6-m
telescope (BTA) in combination with the Nasmyth Echelle Spectrograph (NES), we studied the
features of the optical spectrum of the star MWC 17 with the B[e]-phenomenon. In the wavelength
interval of 4050–6750 ˚A, we identied numerous permitted and forbidden emissions, interstellar Na I
lines, and diﬀuse interstellar bands (DIBs). Radial velocities were estimated from lines of diﬀerent
origin. As the systemic velocity, Vsys, the velocity of the forbidden emissions can be accepted:
−47 km/s (relative to the local standard Vlsr =−42 km/s). Comparison of the obtained data with
the earlier measurements allows us to conclude on the absence of considerable variability of spectral
details.

1. Introduction

The hot B-type star MWC 17 = V832 Cas is referred to the objects with the B[e] phenomenon [1, 2].
The B[e] phenomenon involves having a number of peculiar details in the stellar spectrum: primarily,
strong emission lines of neutral hydrogen H I and helium He I, emissions of the permitted lines of
metal ions, and low-excited forbidden lines. The second signiﬁcant feature of stars with the B[e]
phenomenon is large IR ﬂux excess due to circumstellar hot dust. However, the stars which meet these
two main criteria form a group of highly heterogeneous objects. Lamers et al. [3], having developed
the classiﬁcation criteria for the stars with the B[e]-phenomenon, divided them in ﬁve subtypes. They
did not refer the star MWC 17 to any of those subtypes, it appears in publications as a member of the
most populated B[e]-unclassiﬁed subgroup.

A few dozens of the unclassiﬁed stars with the B[e]-phenomenon were investigated by Miroshnichenko
and coauthors. The review of the results obtained, including the spectral data from the 6-m telescope,
is given in [4]. One of the results of the spectroscopic investigation lies in the fact that unclassiﬁed
B[e]–stars are interacting binary systems in the broad range of luminosities. Objects with luminosities
L≤ 105L⊙ are separated into a new group called the objects of the FS CMa type. About 30% of FS CMa
type objects exhibit various signs of binarity. In [5], it is also suggested to consider the unclassiﬁed
B[e]–stars as interacting binaries.

The main problem in the investigation of stars with the B[e] phenomenon is the estimation of stars
luminosity. The luminosity would allow one to detect the evolution stage of the star and range it to
one or another type of hot stars with similar features in the spectra. Still, in optical spectra of the
stars with the B[e]-phenomenon, as a rule, one cannot ﬁnd the absorptions which form in the stellar
atmosphere conditions and could serve as criteria for luminosity estimation. The fact which also causes
a problem is that two above mentioned distinctive features (spectral peculiarity and IR–ﬂux excess)
are intrinsic to several types of hot stars observed at the essentially diﬀerent evolution stages: young

Herbig Ae/Be stars, evolved massive stars of high luminosity (LBV, supergiants), and far evolved
low-mass stars which are close to the planetary nebula phase.

The situation with the B-type

star VES 695, which is associated with the IR-source
IRAS 00470+6429 and has an emission spectrum, properly illustrates the diﬃculties in determina-
tion of evolutionary status of stars with emission spectra. For a long time, this object had been
considered as a possible protoplanetary nebulae (PPN) candidate at the stage close to the PN phase
(see [6] and references therein). However, the complex study [7], carried out with a large volume of
observation material, including the echelle spectra from the 6-m telescope, resulted in an alternate
conclusion on the evolutionary status of VES 695. Complex of the obtained fundamental parameters
(luminosity, characteristic features of energy distribution in the spectrum, binarity indications for the
star) allowed Miroshnichenko et al. [7] to refer VES 695 to the stars of the FS CMa type.

MWC 17 which is associated with the IR-source IRAS 01441+6026 is one of the hottest
stars with the B[e]-phenomenon. It is located near the galactic plane and has the coordinates:
α(2000) = 01h 47m 38.5s, δ(2000) =+60◦ 41′ 57′′,
l = 129.8◦, and b = −1.4◦. In the optical range,
MWC 17 is quite a faint star with a magnitude V = 11.m7 [8]. Due to high reddening, the star is
weaker in the B band, B = 13.m5 (according to the SIMBAD data), thus, its optical spectrum is under-
studied at present. Zickgraf [8] carried out the only spectroscopic study of MWC 17 with high spectral
resolution. The spectral resolution of his data (R from 23000 to 45000) is comparable to ours, but this
author used only small regions of the spectrum. The Hα, He I 5876, [NII] 6583, [OI] 6300, [SIII] 6312,
and [FeII] 7155 ˚A proﬁles are presented in [8] graphically. Relative intensities and radial velocities are
given for these lines as well as for HeI 6678 and NaI 5890, 5896 ˚A.

To search for possible variability of the MWC 17 optical spectrum and to add data on its peculiarities,
we made detailed identiﬁcation and necessary measurements of the parameters of spectral details of
diﬀerent origin from the spectra obtained with a resolution R = 60000 in the broad wavelength range
4050–6750 ˚A. The observation data used is brieﬂy described in Section 2. Section 3 presents information
on the proﬁle of spectral details found with the high-resolution spectra, their analysis, and discussion
of the results derived. In Section 4, we deal with the position of MWC 17 in the Galaxy, and the main
conclusions are summed up in Section 5.

2. Observed data

We use the MWC 17 spectra obtained on the 6-m telescope with the Nasmyth Echelle Spectrograph
(NES) [9]. The spectrograph equipped with a CCD of 2048×2048 elements and an image slicer [10]
provides R = 60000 in the wavelength range of 3500–6800 ˚A. One-dimensional spectra were extracted
from two–dimensional echelle images using the modiﬁed [11] MIDAS Echelle context. Table 1 shows
the dates of obtaining the spectra and the detected spectral intervals. Correction and control of
instrumental coordination of spectra of the star and the lamp with a hollow cathode were fulﬁlled
with the telluric lines [OI], O2, and H2O. The procedure of radial velocity Vr determination from the
spectra obtained with NES and error sources are described in more detail in [12]. The root-mean-square
error of the measurements is Vr≤0.8 km/s for single narrow line.

3. Main types of line proﬁles

As early as in the ﬁrst publication, when were mentioned some features of the MWC 17 spectrum [13],
a remarkably high intensity of emissions was noted. Intensity variations, from peaks of the strongest
HI, [OI] emissions to the NaI absorption cores, and therefore lowering of the signal-to-noise ratio,
attain three orders of magnitude in the MWC 17 spectrum! Weak emissions, which are hardly distin-
guishable from noise, make it diﬃcult to generate the continuum. Absorptions, by contrast, (except
for depressions in the emission lines) are presented by the interstellar NaI (1) lines, the strongest of
DIBs and, possibly, by the Hδ photospheric wings. With regard to these circumstances, we detected
only small variations of the intensities of the lines and proﬁle shapes and positions with time. The
strongest emissions were on September 2, 2006; the residual intensities of the emission peaks in this
spectrum are on the average 20% higher than in January and 30% higher than in March of the same
year.

Figure 1. Proﬁle of the NaI 5896 ˚A line in the spectrum of MWC 17 averaged over all available spectra.
Numbers 1–4 denote the positions of four proﬁle components from Table 3.

Heliocentric radial velocities, Vr, were found for the proﬁles on the whole or for separate details by
coincidence of their direct and mirror images. When comparing Vr for the same lines in the spectra
obtained on diﬀerent dates, it should be taken into account that apart from random errors, systematic
errors of the order of 1 km/s are also possible. Table 2 shows the examples of the comparison of our
data with each other and with the data from [8]. The proﬁle shape which is complex and changing
from line to line does not allow us to conﬁne ourselves to intensity and a single value of radial velocity
only. These and additional proﬁle parameters are collected in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5. In these tables, r is
the residual intensity of an emission peak or an absorption core, V/R is the ratio of residual intensities
of the blue and red components for double–peaked emissions. The velocities are rounded to whole
km/s, they correspond to:

Vr – the upper part of the whole proﬁle for the emission or the lower part of the absorption

component;

Vem – the emission peaks of a double-peaked proﬁle;
Vabs – the depression in the upper part of the emission line proﬁle;
V(r/2) – the shortwave and longwave (hereinafter “blue” and “red”) slopes of the emission line

proﬁle at the half maximum intensity;

V(r≈1) – the blue and red boundaries of the emission at the bottom of the proﬁle.
The results from [8] are given in italics. Table 3 gives the velocities measured from the NaI (1)

absorption components.

As follows from Table 2, the variations of radial velocities for strong emissions [OI] with distinct
proﬁles in our two spectra, and the discrepancy with the data from [8] do not go beyond the mea-

surement error. The same can be said about the weaker [NII] and [FeII] emissions. Velocity variations
from spectrum to spectrum for other lines are notable. They are mainly due to the variations in the
red regions of the proﬁles (the shifts of their red slopes and peaks). The shifts for the [SIII] and FeII
emissions are about 2–3 km/s, for HeI 5876 ˚A they attain 5 km/s.

Red regions are also most variable in the complex absorption/emission proﬁles of the NaI doublet.
Figure 1 shows the result of averaging the proﬁles of the NaI 5896 ˚A line using several our spectra. The
emission component is presented in this ﬁgure only by its blue region (Vr of −60 km/s), its red region
is overlapped by interstellar extinction. Table 3 shows that three blue components of the NaI 5896 ˚A
line keep their positions while the red component is shifted on November 15, 2005 by −(5–6) km/s
relative to its position in 2006.

The double-peaked Hα emission proﬁle is of type III according to the Beals classiﬁcation [14].
The position of emission peaks Vr≈ −100 and −12 km/s as well as the position of the absorption
Vr≈ −55 km/s are almost constant both in our two spectra of 2005, 2006 and in the earlier spectrum
by Zickgraf [8]. One can see the change in the strongest emission intensities as compared with the data
from [8] (see Table A1 in that paper). Both the [OI] 6300 ˚A and [SIII] 6312 ˚A lines with an excitation
potential of 3.3 eV are 30% stronger in our spectrum than those in [8]. The HeI 5876 ˚A line has scarcely
varied as compared with the measurements by Zickgraf [8].

Table 4 and Fig. 2 illustrate the hierarchy of emission proﬁles by width and degree of asymmetry:
both increase from top lines of the table to the bottom. The velocities in this table are averaged for
the groups of lines with a similar proﬁle shape. They can be useful not only in estimating the structure
and kinematics of the MWC 17 envelope but also in controlling the line identiﬁcation accuracy. As
mentioned in previous studies of MWC 17 (and which is commonly characteristic of B[e]–stars), the
narrowest lines in the optical spectrum are the forbidden emissions [FeII] and [OI]. Both are almost
symmetrical. The former ones have sharper peaks (bifurcation is notable only in some lines and in
some our spectra), the latter ones have more distinctly forked peaks. The red peak of the [OI] proﬁle
is stronger than the blue one.

In accordance with the results from [8], such a ratio of peak intensities is ampliﬁed for the HI, HeI,
and [SIII] lines. According to our data, it is also typical of [NII], [OIII], [FeIII] and generally of most
emissions. An exception is provided by the FeII lines of low excitation (e.g., FeII (49, 48) 5316 ˚A, see
Table 2), the blue component of which can be stronger than the red one.

The permitted FeII emissions are notably broader than the forbidden ones, and they are slightly
asymmetric: the blue slope is steeper than the red one. The low and high-excitation FeII lines (about 3
and 10 eV respectively) noticeably diﬀer by the shape of the proﬁle upper part: it is close to rectangular
for the latter ones (e.g., the FeII 6318 ˚A line proles in Table 2), the central depression is not distinct.
Diﬀerence in widths of the permitted and forbidden emissions indicate that these groups of lines origin
in diﬀerent physical conditions.

The members of the 42-nd FeII multiplet, which is the strongest in the visible spectrum, stand out
for their proﬁle shape. They are as broad as the other FeII emissions but abruptly get narrow toward
the tops due to intensity decrease in the blue half of the line. As can be seen from Table 4 and Fig. 2,

the positions of the red emission peak and the whole red slope of the proﬁle are almost the same as
in other Fe II lines; the blue peak is weak and shifted toward the red region, it is faintly visible on the
blue slope which is much smoother than the red one. Such asymmetry (the blue peak is not distinct
and is weaker than the red one, the blue slope is smoother than the red one) is as well characteristic of
emissions of forbidden ions [NII], [SIII], and [FeIII] which are broader at the bottom. It also remains
in the broadest (exclusive of those of hydrogen) HeI and [OIII] lines. Among the model proﬁles [8],
those are the most similar to the observed spectrum of MWC 17 which are computed for a tilted disk
(i≈ 45◦), while Zickgraf [8] considers that i≈ 80◦ for MWC 17.

Table 5 shows the identiﬁed lines and their parameters. As the discrepancies in the parameters
from spectrum to spectrum for most lines are small, each line is presented here by a single set of the
parameters. In the wavelength interval 4050–4570 ˚A, the parameters were obtained from the spectrum
of March 14, 2006; in longer wavelength intervals, they were found by averaging two or more spectra.
As follows from Table 5, we have not detected any absorptions in the MWC 17 spectrum with all the
high-quality material in the broad wavelength interval. Using spectra with a resolution limit of 1.3 ˚A,
Jaschek and Andrillat [15] found several absorptions forming in the stellar atmosphere: AlII 6066,
SII 6102, NII 6632, and CII 6800 ˚A. We have not detected the rst three absorptions, which could occur
in our spectral interval.

4. Location of MWC 17 in the Galaxy

If not particularly the radial velocity of the star itself (it may be peculiar), then at least the presence
of the blue-shifted components in the interstellar NaI (1) lines with velocities of up to −50 km/s (there
is even a weak component with a velocity of about −60 km/s) says that MWC 17 is located in the
Perseus Arm or behind it. The distance to MWC 17 can be estimated by diﬀerent methods, but the
peculiarity of the object make all them unreliable.

– Spectrophotometric parallax. The absence of photospheric absorptions in the stars spectrum makes
the accepted (B-V)0 color index uncertain. Martel and Gravina [16] give the following for MWC 17:
V = 11.m66, (B-V) = 0.m42; along with this, for early subtype B we obtain the color excess E(B-
V)≈ 0.m65 and visual brightness extinction Av≈ 2.m5. Let us notice that we obtain a smaller excess
E(B-V)≈ 0.m4 using the measured equivalent width of the interstellar band W(5780)≈0.2 ˚A and
correlation W(5780)–E(B-V) from [17].
Even with Mv≈ −4m (such a luminosity would rather correspond to a star from the upper part of
the main sequence than to a supergiant), d≈ 4 kpc. It is the lower limit of the MWC 17 distance.
However, the estimates of both the stars color and its spectral type are unreliable until the distorting
inﬂuence of emissions is taken into account and photospheric lines are detected. However, if we bear
in mind that according to Miroshnichenko [18], the visual magnitude of the star V≈ 13m, then the
distance to it will be considerably greater.

– According to [19], the interstellar extinction toward MWC 17 reaches 2.m5 at a distance of 1 kpc and
remains almost the same up to 3–4 kpc. If we assume the above estimated Av≈ 2.m5 for MWC 17,
we will obtain only a limitation on the objects distance, d>1 kpc.

– Among the velocities given in Table 4, the closest to Vsys can be the velocities of the forbidden
emissions: −47 km/s (Vlsr =−42 km/s). By Brand and Blitz [20], a distance d≥2 kpc corresponds
to this value.

There is an important additional point: in the sky, MWC 17 is located at the southern boundary of
the compact association Cas OB 8 (d≈2.9 kpc from [21]). For the member of this association HD 9311,
Vr =−42 km/s; the structure of the interstellar NaI lines in its spectrum is similar to that in the
MWC 17 spectrum (Vr≈ −(65 ÷ 50), −14 km/s [22]). Obviously, the question on possible membership
of MWC 17 in Cas OB 8 is a key one for determination of the distance and origin of the object.
Meanwhile, we have to assume that the distance to MWC 17 can be of the order of both 4–5 kpc and
2–3 kpc — in the case there is some additional (possibly circumstellar) extinction.

The proﬁle of the NaI D lines in the MWC 17 spectrum is close to that observed in the spectrum of
the hot B-type star – the optical component of the IR-source IRAS 00470+6429, which is located near
the galactic plane and has the coordinates α(2000) = 00h 50m 06s, δ(2000) = +64◦ 45′ 35′′, l = 122.◦8,
and b = 1.◦9. In the optical spectrum of its central star, there are two interstellar components of
the NaI D lines [7]. Heliocentric radial velocities in the IRAS 00470+6429 spectrum (about −62 and
−13 km/s) coincide with those in the MWC 17 spectrum. In the spectra of both objects, the positions
of diﬀuse interstellar bands are also similar: Vr(DIB)≈ −14 km/s.

5. Conclusions

High quality of the spectral data which we used allowed us to identify numerous details in the spectrum
of MWC 17. The thorough search has not led to detection of any absorptions in the spectrum which
emerge in the stellar atmosphere. Out of absorption details, only interstellar components of the NaI D
lines and DIBs were identiﬁed. The DIBs are weak, the equivalent widths are W(5780)≈ 0.2 ˚A and
W(5797)≈ 0.15 ˚A.

As a systemic velocity, Vsys, the velocity for forbidden emissions can be accepted: −47 km/s (relative

to the local standard Vlsr =−42 km/s).

Comparison between our results and the measurements of Zickgraf [8] allows us to draw an inference

on the absence of signiﬁcant variability of spectral details.

We noticed variations of radial velocities from spectrum to spectrum which are small and can hardly
give sure evidence on spectral binarity of MWC 17. In order to solve this problem, observations of this
star with high positional accuracy should be continued. Taking into account high intensity of the
emission details in the spectrum of this faint star, such observations can be also made on telescopes
of a moderate diameter.
