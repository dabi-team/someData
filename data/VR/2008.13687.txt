ABSTRACT

The Galactic Center region, including the nuclear disk, has until recently been largely avoided in chemical census studies
because of extreme extinction and stellar crowding. Large, near-IR spectroscopic surveys, such as the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), allow the measurement of metallicities in the inner region of
our Galaxy. Making use of the latest APOGEE data release (DR16), we are able for the ﬁrst time to study cool AGB
stars and supergiants in this region. The stellar parameters of ﬁve known AGB stars and one supergiant star (VR 5-7)
show that their location is well above the tip of the RGB. We study metallicities of 157 M giants situated within 150 pc
of the Galactic center from observations obtained by the APOGEE survey with reliable stellar parameters from the
APOGEE/ASPCAP pipeline making use of the cool star grid down to 3200 K. Distances, interstellar extinction values,
and radial velocities were checked to conﬁrm that these stars are indeed situated in the Galactic Center region. We detect
a clear bimodal structure in the metallicity distribution function, with a dominant metal-rich peak of [Fe/H] ∼ +0.3 dex
and a metal-poor peak around [Fe/H] = −0.5 dex, which is 0.2 dex poorer than Baade’s Window. The α- elements Mg,
Si, Ca, and O show a similar trend to the Galactic Bulge. The metal-poor component is enhanced in the α-elements,
suggesting that this population could be associated with the classical bulge and a fast formation scenario. We ﬁnd a
clear signature of a rotating nuclear stellar disk and a signiﬁcant fraction of high velocity stars with vgal > 300 km/s; the
metal-rich stars show a much higher rotation velocity (∼ 200 km/s) with respect to the metal-poor stars (∼ 140 km/s).
The chemical abundances as well as the metallicity distribution function suggest that the nuclear stellar disc and the
nuclear star cluster show distinct chemical signatures and might be formed diﬀerently.

1. Introduction

The Milky Way bulge is such a complex system that its
formation and evolution are still poorly understood. As
a result of high extinction and crowding, the study of
the Galactic bulge remains challenging. Extinction of more
than 30 mag in AV in the Galactic center (GC) regions re-
quires IR spectroscopy. While an increasing number of de-

tailed chemical abundances in the intermediate and outer
bulge (such as Baade’s Window) are now available thanks
to large spectroscopic surveys such as ARGOS (Freeman
et al. 2013), Gaia-ESO (Rojas-Arriagada et al. 2014), and
APOGEE (Garc´ıa P´erez et al. 2013), chemical abundances
of stars in the inner Galactic bulge (IGB) with projected
distances of RG ≤ 200 pc from the GC remain poorly stud-
ied.

M. Schultheis et al.: Cool stars in the Galactic Center as seen by APOGEE

There have been a few earlier works dedicated to study-
ing the chemistry of stars in the central part of the Milky
Way. Using high-resolution IR spectra (R ∼40,000), Carr
et al. (2000) made the ﬁrst detailed abundance measure-
ment of a star in the Galactic center within 1 pc, the M2
supergiant IRS 7, ﬁnding roughly solar metallicity and an
abundance pattern that was consistent with the dredge-
up of CNO cycle products. Ram´ırez et al. (2000) also an-
alyzed high-resolution IR spectra (R=40,000) of a sam-
ple of ten cool supergiant and red-giant stars in the GC
and estimated an iron abundance of +0.12 ± 0.22 dex.
Subsequently, Cunha et al. (2007) used R ∼50,000 spectra
to study the detailed chemistry of the Ram´ırez et al. (2000)
sample and found a slightly enhanced and narrow metallic-
ity distribution ((cid:104)[Fe/H](cid:105) = +0.14 ± 0.06 dex) that was also
alpha-enhanced: note that this small sample of 10 stars,
save for one, were members of the central cluster. More re-
cently, Ryde & Schultheis (2015, RS2015) studied nine ﬁeld
stars with projected distances of R ≤ 50 pc and also found a
metal-rich population with [Fe/H] = +0.11 ± 0.15 dex and
a lack of a metal-poor population (similarly to Cunha et
al. 2007), but found low [α/Fe] values, except for calcium.
Their mean metallicities are ∼ 0.3 dex higher than ﬁelds in
the inner bulge (Rich et al. 2007; Rich et al. 2012a), indi-
cating that the GC region contains a distinct population.
A reﬁned analysis (Nandakumar et al. 2018) gave a slightly
higher mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = +0.3 ± 0.10 dex and
conﬁrmed the very narrow distribution. Grieco et al. (2015)
compared these data with a chemical evolution model and
concluded that in order to reproduce the observed [α/Fe]
ratios, the GC region should have experienced a main
strong burst of star formation and should have evolved very
quickly with an IMF which contains more massive stars.

Ryde et al. (2016) presented an abundance study of 28
M giants in ﬁelds located within a few degrees south of
the GC using high-resolution (R ∼50,000) spectra. They
found a wide range of metallicities that narrows towards
the center and conﬁrmed the Rich et al. (2012b) study that
found alpha enhancement throughout the inner bulge. This
would be consistent with a homogeneous enrichment his-
tory in the inner bulge. More recently, Schultheis et al.
(2019) found evidence of a chemically distinct population
in the nucleus (nuclear stellar disc and nuclear star clus-
ter) compared to the Inner Galactic Bulge that shows a
very high fraction of metal-rich stars (∼ 80%) with a mean
metallicity of +0.2 dex in the GC. They concluded that the
nucleus mimics a metallicity gradient of ∼ −0.27 dex/kpc
in the inner 600 pc but is ﬂat if the GC is excluded.

Schultheis et al. (2015)[hereafter referred to as S15]
studied 33 M giant stars of APOGEE in the so-called
GALCEN ﬁeld to study the metallicity distribution func-
tion and chemical abundances using the DR12 data release
(Alam et al. 2015). However, they had to limit their analysis
to stars with Teﬀ > 3700 K, due to problems with modeling
of the coolest stars (Holtzman et al. 2015), thus excluding
a large number of cool stars- including asymptotic giant
branch stars (AGB) and supergiants- from their analysis.
They found some evidence of the presence of a metal-poor
fraction of stars that are α-enhanced.

In this paper we take advantage of the recently released
and improved results from APOGEE DR16 (Ahumada
et al. 2019), which has several improvements over previous
data releases, in particular, DR12 (see details in J¨onsson et
al. 2020) and includes additional observations of one plate

at APOGEE-S that is dedicated to observations of targets
in the Galactic center. It is most relevant to the study of
cool luminous stars in the central parts of the Milky Way
that the DR16 results now extend to eﬀective tempera-
tures as low as 3200K using the grid of spherical MARCS
model atmospheres (Gustafsson et al. 2008). In this paper
we present results for the metallicity distribution function
and chemical abundances of 157 M giants, which constitutes
one of the largest high-resolution spectroscopic samples in
the inner degree of the Milky Way to date. In addition, this
is the ﬁrst study of cool AGB stars and supergiants in the
GALCEN ﬁeld using results from the APOGEE survey.

2. The sample

2.1. APOGEE

The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment (APOGEE) is a large scale, near-IR, high-
resolution (R ∼ 22, 500) spectroscopic survey of the
Milky Way stellar populations, mainly focused on red gi-
ants (Majewski et al. 2017; Zasowski et al. 2013, 2017).
APOGEE has been a component of both SDSS-III and
SDSS-IV (Eisenstein et al. 2011; Blanton et al. 2017)
and uses custom-built twin spectrographs at Apache Point
Observatory’s 2.5 m Sloan Telescope and Las Campanas
Observatory’s 2.5 m du Pont telescope (Gunn et al. 2006;
Wilson et al. 2019). APOGEE observes in the H-band,
where extinction by dust is signiﬁcantly lower than at op-
tical wavelengths (e.g., A(H)/A(V ) ∼ 0.16).

With its high resolution and high S/N (∼ 100 per
Nyquist-sampled pixel), APOGEE determines both accu-
rate radial velocities (better than 0.5 km s−1) and reliable
abundance measurements,
including the most abundant
metals in the universe (C, N, O), along with other α, odd-Z,
and iron-peak elements. The latest SDSS-IV Data Release
(DR16; Ahumada et al. 2019) provides to the scientiﬁc com-
munity spectra of more than 430,000 stars, as well as the
derived stellar properties, including radial velocities, eﬀec-
tive temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, and in-
dividual abundances. Additional information, such as pho-
tometry and target selection criteria, is also provided and
described in Zasowski et al. (2013, 2017). Stellar parame-
ters and chemical abundances for up to 24 elements were
derived by the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical
Abundances Pipeline (ASPCAP, Garc´ıa P´erez et al. 2016),
while in Nidever et al. (2015) the data reduction and ra-
dial velocity pipelines are described. The model grids are
based on a complete set of MARCS stellar atmospheres
(Gustafsson et al. 2008), and the spectral synthesis using
the Turbospectrum code (Alvarez & Plez 1998,Plez 2012)
with a new updated line list has been used (Smith et al.
2020, submitted).

In addition to DR16, we use additional observations
including additional stars observed after those released in
DR16 from APOGEE-S. These data were reduced with the
same pipeline as the DR16 stars.

2.2. Distances

We obtained the StarHorse (SH) distances from Queiroz et
al. (Queiroz et al. 2020a) for the latest APOGEE-2 survey
data release DR16, as well as for the additional stars not
present in DR16. SH is a Bayesian ﬁtting code that derives

tus one would need to have photometric light curves and/or
some key chemical information from optical spectra (e.g.
Lithium and s-process elements; Garc´ıa-Hern´andez et al.
2006, 2007 (see also Garc´ıa-Hern´andez 2017 for a review).
The factor 1.82 corresponds to the AK/E(H−K) ratio from
Indebetouw et al. (2005). The 15 AGB/supergiant candi-
date stars in our ﬁnal sample together with their stellar
parameters are given in Tab. 2.

Figure 1 shows the dereddened color-magnitude dia-
gram of the full GALCEN sample, together with the known
AGB/supergiant stars and candidate AGB/supergiant
stars, colored by the galactocentric radius. As AGB stars
and supergiants have circumstellar material due to their
mass-loss, the dereddening of those stars were obtained by
obtaining the median E(J-K) color excess from the VVV ex-
tinction map (Gonzalez et al. 2012) instead of the APOGEE
estimate. Clearly visible is the foreground contribution with
(J − K)0 < 0.8 which can be easily removed by a simple
distance cut. The AGBs and supergiants (both known and
candidates) are the most luminous stars and they lie well
above the tip of the RGB with K0 = 7.9 (Habing & Olofsson
2004), indicated by the dashed line. By imposing a cutoﬀ
in RGC < 3.5 kpc a total of 157 stars are left over for our
analysis. We will refer to this and later on as the GALCEN
sample.

distances and extinction but also other quantities such as
ages and masses. For more details about the method, the
priors, and its validation, we refer to Queiroz et al. (2018)
and to Queiroz et al. (Queiroz et al. 2020a) which combines
the ASPCAP stellar parameters with Gaia DR2 and photo-
metric surveys achieving in this way precise distances and
extinction; the extinction treatment has been signiﬁcantly
improved in the updated version. The typical internal pre-
cision in distance for our GALCEN DR16 sample is about
10 ± 7%. SH uses the APOGEE targeting extinction esti-
mate (see Zasowski et al. 2013, Zasowski et al. 2017) as
a prior for the total line-of-sight extinction. In addition,
we also did a comparison with the 3D extinction map of
Schultheis et al. (2014) using VVV data and the 2D extinc-
tion map of Gonzalez et al. (2012) where we ﬁnd similar
AK values (within 10% uncertainty) with respect to RJCE.

2.3. The GALCEN ﬁeld

Two plates of GALCEN, one at APO (location ID 4330)
and one at LCO (location ID 5534), have been observed
with a total number of 619 stars. Due to the high interstellar
extinction, a special target selection procedure has been ap-
plied for the GALCEN ﬁeld (Zasowski et al. 2013). Known
AGB long-period variables based on K-band lightcurves
(Matsunaga et al. 2009) have been targeted as well as spec-
troscopically identiﬁed supergiants such as IRS7, IRS19,
and IRS22 and supergiant candidates based on photometric
color-color criteria. These AGB and supergiant targets have
among the coolest eﬀective temperatures (Teﬀ < 3500K) in
the APOGEE stellar sample. While in S15 due to the limit-
ing ATLAS9 model atmospheres grid in ASPCAP for cool
stars, only 33 warm K/M giants were used, we make use
in this paper of the cooler model grid of MARCS model
atmospheres to quadruple the sample.

One of the most signiﬁcant improvement of DR16 com-
pared to DR14 is the accuracy and consistency of the
derived stellar parameters for the coolest giants (Teﬀ <
3500 K) which is due to the use of MARCS model atmo-
spheres in spherical symmetry. This improvement can be
clearly seen by the visual inspection of the HR diagram
(see e.g. Fig. 3) , especially the “clumpiness” of the HR
diagram with Teﬀ < 3500 K seen in DR14 is now gone (see
J¨onsson et al. 2020). However, “external” calibrators for
these cool stars are lacking which would be important to
estimate the accuracy of the stellar parameters for those
objects.

From the 270 stars, AGB/supergiant candidates have
been chosen as those brighter than H < 12.2, 1.3 < H−K <
3.7, which excludes AGB/supergiant stars with strong IR
excess, and K0 = K−(1.82∗((H−K)−0.2)) < 4.7, which is
the dereddened magnitude to put the star above the AGB
tip. Note that the more massive (>3-4 solar masses) and O-
rich AGB stars can be brighter (because of ﬂux contribution
by hot bottom burning) than the AGB theoretical luminos-
ity limit (see e.g. Garc´ıa-Hern´andez et al. 2009) and that to
unambiguously distinguish between AGB or supergiant sta-

50 pc to SgrA*. The majority of the M giants in our sam-
ple are located in relatively low extinction windows with
E(J − K) < 3.0 with projected distances of 50–150 pc away
from the GC. We also superimpose the stellar mass distri-
bution of the nuclear disk from Launhardt et al. (2002).

Stellar parameters and chemical abundances of up to
24 elements are determined by the ASPCAP pipeline (see
Garc´ıa P´erez et al. 2016). These values are based on a χ2
minimization between observed and synthetic model spec-
tra (see Zamora et al. 2015; Holtzman et al. 2015 for more
details on the DR16 spectral libraries) performed with the
FERRE code (Allende Prieto et al. 2006, and subsequent
updates).

Figure 3 shows the HR diagram of the GALCEN sam-
ple colored by the metallicity. Superimposed are PARSEC
isochrones (Pastorelli et al. 2019) assuming an age of
8 Gyr. Indicated are the approximate limits of the RGB
with Mbol < −3.5 (Habing & Olofsson 2004) and the tip
of the AGB with Mbol = −7.0 (Schultheis et al. 2003).
However, as pointed out by McQuinn et al. (2019), the
tip of the RGB becomes brighter for metal-rich stars with
up to 0.3 mag diﬀerence in the K-band (see their Fig. 6).
The spread in the eﬀective temperature at a given surface
gravity is mainly due to the metallicity, nicely also indi-
cated by the isochrones. The known AGB stars are situ-
ated above the tip of the RGB and show similar metal-
licities as expected from their location in the HR dia-
gram following the stellar isochrones. We notice, however,
two stars, 2M17462584-2850001 and 2M17470135-2831410,
showing very low metallicities ([Fe/H] < −2.0) where their
projected metallicities on the HR diagram do not match
the isochrone metallicities. Their ASPCAP ﬁts are partic-
ularly bad (i.e. relatively high χ2 values). One of these
stars (2M17462584-2850001) is a known AGB star with

a Mira-like long variability period of 519 days, while the
other star (2M17470135-2831410) is an AGB/supergiant
candidate with no period information available but with
a near-IR variability more typical of an extreme AGB
star. The automatic pipeline ASPCAP does not work well
for extreme AGB/supergiant stars (e.g. the more massive
and/or evolved dusty AGBs or extreme and dusty red su-
pergiants; APOGEE/ASPCAP team, priv. comm.). For the
very few known extreme Galactic disk (solar metallicity) O-
rich AGB stars observed by APOGEE, ASPCAP system-
atically gives much lower metallicities (even by 2 dex) for
the longer period stars, which are expected to be the more
massive and/or evolved dusty AGBs. There are several rea-
sons for this like veiling by hot dust emission, stronger de-
generacies due to their much more complex spectra and/or
the speciﬁc pulsational phase during the observations, with
the ﬁrst one being very likely the dominant factor. This is
because the strong hot dust emission in these stars veils
the spectrum and the molecular bands look much weaker
than reality; ASPCAP could thus compensate this with a
much lower global metallicity and/or a higher Teﬀ. Thus,

two particular and extreme stars.

ASPCAP metallicity of [Fe/H] ∼ −2.17 compared to
the others. The ASPCAP χ2 value is higher than 100,
compared to a typical value of about 20–50 for the
other stars, making the stellar parameters, including the
global metallicity, unreliable. We omit this star for our
study.

tively. They both also show some moderate water ab-

3. AGB stars and supergiants

3.1. Previously known AGB stars and supergiants

Schultheis et al. (2003)[hereafter referred to as S03] per-
formed low-resolution spectroscopic follow-up observations
of sources with bright excess at 7 and 15µm from the
ISOGAL survey (Omont et al. 2003), which probed the stel-
lar populations of the inner region of the Milky Way. The
majority of these sources are long-period variables on the
AGB with strong mass-loss, well traced by their 15 µm ex-
cess (Glass 1999). S03 have shown that the molecular bands
of 12CO and H2O, together with the bolometric magni-
tudes, are an excellent indicator of stellar populations such
as AGB stars, supergiants, red giants and young stellar ob-
jects.

– 2M17451937-2914052 is a high luminosity OH/IR star
from the OH/IR star sample of Ortiz et al. (2002). These
are the most extreme AGB stars, with large pulsational
periods (several hundreds of days) and mass-loss rates
up to a few times 10−5M(cid:12)/yr, displaying the highest
bolometric luminosities (Mbol < −4). S03 estimated the
Mbol ∼ −5.13 and the mass-loss rate of 8 × 10−6M(cid:12)/yr.
The Near-IR low-resolution spectrum of S03 shows ex-
tremely strong water absorption at about 1.7 µm, typ-
ical for large amplitude pulsation (see e.g. Lan¸con &
Wood 2000).

– 2M17462584-2850001 is also a known OH/IR star which
was monitored by Wood et al. (1998) and appears also in
the catalog of large amplitude variables of Glass et al.
(2001) and Matsunaga et al. (2009). It has a period
of 505 days (while 519 days in Matsunaga et al. 2009)
and an amplitude in K of 1.60 mag. It has a very low

– 2M17461658-2849498 (VR 5-7) is a member of the
Quintuplet Cluster (Moneti et al. 1994) and has been
classiﬁed as a supergiant with a spectral type of M6I
(Liermann et al. 2009). Cunha et al. (2007) obtained
a photometric temperature (based on the measure-
ments of the CO molecular band) of 3600 K, a pho-
tometric log g of -0.15 dex, and an iron abundance of
+0.14 dex. Davies et al. (2009) observed VR 5-7 in H-
band at Keck with NIRSPEC and a spectral resolution
of 17,000. They obtained a Teﬀ of 3400±200 K, a log g of
0.0 ± 0.3 dex and a [Fe/H] = 0.10 ± 0.11 dex. While the
temperature and surface gravity agrees within the er-
rors, the metallicity of APOGEE is about 0.2 dex lower.

Figure 4 shows the APOGEE spectrum of VR 5-7 to-
gether with the best model ﬁt of ASPCAP (in red). We
clearly see the strong impact of the molecular lines such
as CN, OH and CO (indicated as gray, orange and lime,
respectively)

3.2. AGB/supergiant candidates

As mentioned in Sect 2.3, AGB/supergiant candidates have
been chosen using a photometric color-cut in (H–K) as well
as the dereddened magnitude cut of K0 to put the star
above the tip of the AGB. In total 15 AGB/supergiant can-
didates are in our sample with the stellar parameters given
in Tab. 2. Twelve stars out of ﬁfteen lie indeed above the
tip of the RGB in Fig. 3 and ﬁve of them even above the
tip of the AGB. One of them, 2M17463266-2837184, shows
an extreme (J − K)0 color of about 5 and could be an AGB
star with strong mass-loss. The three remaining stars are
only about 0.2–0.3 dex below the tip of the RGB which is
approximately the uncertainties of the derived surface grav-
ities of APOGEE for those kind of objects. This shows that
a photometric H–K cut together with the dereddened K
magnitude is a priori a good ﬁrst indication of detecting M
AGB/supergiants. Three additional stars lie above the tip
of the AGB which show also very high luminosities in the
CMD (Fig. 1) making them excellent candidates of being
supergiant stars. The relatively high fraction of supergiants
in GALCEN is compatible with a recent increased star for-
mation rate during the last 200-300 Myr (Pfuhl et al. 2011).

4. Metallicity distribution function

Schultheis et al. (2015) already had some indications for the
existence of a metal-poor population in GC region based on

weighted sum of a number of Gaussian components. In or-
der to constrain the number of Gaussians, we adopted the
Akaike information criterion (AIC), which gives preference
of a two-component solution. For comparison we also per-
formed a GMM for Baade’s window (BW) with the same
sample criteria, deﬁned as in Schultheis et al. (2017) but
applied to the DR16 data release.

We ﬁnd in both samples, GALCEN and BW, a narrow
metal-rich component and a broader metal-poor compo-
nent. The metal-rich component of both ﬁelds are centered
at around [Fe/H] = +0.3 dex, with a slightly larger dis-
persion for the GALCEN ﬁeld. Very striking and visible
is the metal-poor peak in the GALCEN ﬁeld centered at
[Fe/H] = −0.53 dex. This is about 0.2 dex more metal-poor
than the equivalent peak in BW while the dispersions are
very similar (∼ 0.4 dex). 63% of the population in BW is
in the metal-poor regime while for the GALCEN ﬁeld it is
about 47% (73 stars out of 157).

In order to test the statistical signiﬁcance we performed
a Bootstrapping analysis with 1000 resamplings. We ﬁnd
for BW the metal-rich peak at [Fe/H] = −0.33 ± 0.03
and for the metal-poor component a [Fe/H] = 0.38 ± 0.01
while for GALCEN the two components are situated at
[Fe/H] = 0.30 ± 0.03 and [Fe/H] = −0.54 ± 0.08, respec-
tively. The mean weight of the metal-poor component of

their metallicity distribution function (MDF) as shown in
their Fig. 4. With our larger sample here, we performed a
Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) decomposition, which
is a parametric probability density function given by the

6

M. Schultheis et al.: Cool stars in the Galactic Center as seen by APOGEE

BW is 62.8 ± 3.6% while for GALCEN it is 46.6 ± 6.3%
leading to a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence of 2.23 sigma.
Indicated in green are also the previously known 4
AGB stars and the supergiant star VR 5-7, as well as
the AGB/supergiant candidates. A visual inspection of the
overall shape of the MDF of these cool stars shows that
they follow the general trend of the normal red giants. This
makes us conﬁdent that indeed the metallicities of those
cool stars are reliable. Unfortunately, the sample size is too
small to perform any statistical test. We also notice that
the dispersion in the metallicity for these stars is much
narrower (∼ 0.25 dex) compared to the M giants, however
clearly a larger sample size is needed in order to attribute
diﬀerences in the MDF.

Zoccali et al. (2017) used simple limits of [Fe/H] > +0.1
to deﬁne metal-rich stars, and [Fe/H] < −0.1 for the
metal-poor ones, to argue that the metal-rich population
of their GIBS data is ﬂattened and concentrated towards
the Galactic plane, while the metal-poor component is
spheroidal. Schultheis et al. (2019) used these same crite-
ria to detect a very prominent metallicity spike (see their
Fig. 4) in the Galactic Center (including the Nuclear Star
Cluster), where about 80% of their sample is metal-rich. If
we apply the same criterion to the GALCEN ﬁeld, we ﬁnd
about 50% of the stars at |z| = 0.80 kpc to be metal-rich, in
perfect agreement within the inner four degrees as shown
in Fig. 4 of Schultheis et al. (2019). This strengthens the
evidence for a distinct stellar system in the GC region with
respect to the Inner Galactic Bulge (|b| < 2o).

5. Chemical Abundances

Schultheis et al. (2015) could only study the general α-
element abundances for the GALCEN ﬁeld with APOGEE
DR12, but with DR16 we are able to study the detailed
chemistry of the cooler end of the giant branch. We restrict
here our analysis to regular M giant stars and do not in-
clude the known and candidate AGB/supergiants stars. As
a comparison sample, we use the Galactic Bulge sample
by Queiroz et al. (2020, in prep.) based on SH distances
and the Zasowski et al. (2019) Bulge sample, updated for
DR16. The sample was deﬁned as stars falling inside the
Galactocentric coordinates |X| < 5 kpc, |Y| < 3.5 kpc, |Z| <
1.0 kpc with an additional cut in the reduced proper mo-
tion diagram. We refer here to Queiroz et al. (Queiroz et al.
2020b) for a detailed description on their Bulge sample. In
addition, we restricted our sample to RGC ≤ 3.5 kpc., leav-
ing about 5800 Bulge stars for our comparison which is
shown in Fig. 6. The detailed properties of the comparison
Bulge sample will be discussed in an accompanying paper.
In addition, we show as a comparison the Bulge sample of
Zasowski et al. (2019), updated for DR16.

We use calibrated chemical abundances and we omit
stars where the individual error on each studied chemical
element is larger than 0.02 dex. The overall behaviors for
the alpha elements Mg, Si, O and Ca are shown as a func-
tion of [Fe/H] in Fig. 6. Due to the large number of bulge
comparison stars, we use densities for the Zasowski et al.
(2019) sample and contours for the Queiroz et al. sample
(see Fig. 6). In addition, we use samples in the literature of
Rich et al. (2012a), Nandakumar et al. (2018) in the inner
Bulge (|b| < 1o) and Cunha et al. (2007) for stars in the
nuclear star cluster.

The GALCEN stars (black dots) overall follow the same
behavior as the Galactic Bulge stars of Queiroz et al. (2020,
in prep.). Concerning the behavior of APOGEE results for
[α/F e]–[Fe/H] it is clear that Ca shows, compared to the
other α-elements, a diﬀerent behavior where stars with sub-
solar metallicities are less enhanced compared to Mg, O and
Si; the Ca abundances also decrease for higher metallicities
while the other alpha-elements tend to show a ﬂattening. In
the DR16 results, there is a noticeable feature (reminiscent
of a “ﬁnger”, J¨onsson et al. 2020) at [Ca/Fe] ∼ +0.25 and
[O/Fe] ∼ +0.25 and [Fe/H] > 0; such horizontal sequence
of stars had already been noticed for the DR14 results in
the inner Bulge sample (Zasowski et al. 2019). J¨onsson et
al. (J¨onsson et al. 2020) concluded that the tightness of
this feature, which contains about 4% of the main stellar
sample of giants, makes it likely that this feature is due
to some possible systematics in the abundance determina-
tions, which the APOGEE/ASPCAP team has not yet been
able to identify. However, most likely due to our small sam-
ple size, we do not ﬁnd this feature in the GALCEN sample.
As in DR14, we see that the oxygen abundances show
the tightest sequence compared to Mg, Si and Ca, in par-
ticular for low metallicities. Worthwhile mentioning is the
extremely ﬂat behavior of oxygen for high metallicities
([Fe/H] > 0.1), as already noted by Zasowski et al. (2019);
the DR16 data release using the MARCS models conﬁrm
this trend. However, Johnson et al. (2014) found in their
analysis of Bulge stars in the optical and by comparing
them with values in the literature that the O-abundances
decrease for higher metallicities with no sign of a ﬂatten-
ing (see their Fig. 13). So this ﬂattening at higher metal-
licities found in the APOGEE data has to be taken with
caution as it could be an artifact; however, deriving oxy-
gen abundances for high-metallicity stars in the optical can
also be challenging. For example, very recently Santos-Peral
et al. (2020) has shown based on high-resolution optical
spectra, that this ﬂattening for the metal-rich stars can be
explained by an incorrect continuum normalization. They
demonstrate that with a proper continuum normalization,
for example the alpha-element Mg decreases steadily with
increasing metallicity with no signs of a ﬂattening. From the
theoretical point of view, the ﬂattening can be reproduced
by increasing the stellar yields for high metallicities by a
factor of 3.5 (see Matteucci et al. 2020) or by radial migra-
tion (see e.g Minchev et al. 2014, Anders et al. 2017). Si and
Mg show very similar trends with a less pronounced knee
position than oxygen. Striking for both elements is the ﬂat-
tening at high metallicities while Nandakumar et al. (2018)
show a decreasing trend of Si and Mg for the metal-rich
stars. Johnson et al. (2014) shows for their Bulge sample
that Mg and Si decrease as well with increasing metallicity.
Interestingly, the sample of Cunha et al. (2007), which are
stars in the nuclear star cluster, are also enhanced, but in
a single metallicity.

6. Is the nuclear star disc and the nuclear star

cluster chemically distinct?

Cunha et al. (2007) already noticed for their sample of M
giants in the NSC α-enhancement in [O/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] at
super-solar metallicities. Recently, Thorsbro et al. (2020)
reveals also alpha-enhanced, metal-rich stars in the NSC
which could be sign of a starburst activity, initiated by a

sudden accretion of gas, either primordial or slightly en-
riched. Although their sample is small and clearly more
stars are needed to conﬁrm their results, they show a pos-
sible sign of a starburst, making a kind of “loop” structure
in the [Si/Fe]vs.[Fe/H] diagram which can be explained as
following: The sudden accretion of gas will ﬁrst result in a
dilution of chemical abundances (e.g. Fe) before the [Si/Fe]
vs.[Fe/H] ratio increases due to the contribution of core-
collapse SNe II, following by a decrease of [α/Fe] due to
the Fe production from Type Ia SNe. In our Fig. 6, which
probes the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) we do not see evidence
of alpha-enhanced metal-rich stars suggesting a chemical
distinction between the NSC and the NSD. In addition,
Feldmeier-Krause et al. (2020) traced the metallicity dis-
tribution function in the NSC based on 600 late type stars.
We compare the MDF in Fig. 7 between their sample and
our GALCEN sample which we restrict to |b| < 0.40 in or-
der to probe the NSD (see Fig. 2). Although only ∼ 50 stars
are left over to be in the NSD, we see that the two MDFs
diﬀer, in particular the MDF of the NSD shows a more sig-

niﬁcant metal-poor tail ([Fe/H] < −0.5) compared to the
NSC. Performing a bootstrapping with 1000 resamplings we
ﬁnd for the NSD the metal-poor peak at −0.57 ± 0.19 dex,
while for the NSC at −0.36±0.12 dex. However, the sample
size of the NSD is clearly too small and more observations
are needed.

In addition, we see also diﬀerences in their star forma-
tion histories. While the majority of stars in the NSC and
NSD are old (80% of the stars are ∼ 10 Gyr old), Nogueras-
Lara et al. (2019) detected sign of a recent star formation
around 1 Gyr ago in the NSC which is not present for the
NSC (Pfuhl et al. 2011, Sch¨odel et al. 2020). This strength-
ens the argument that indeed the NSC and NSD are chem-
ically distinct and these two systems might have formed
diﬀerently.

7. Kinematics versus metallicity

We transformed the heliocentric radial velocities to galac-
tocentric velocities according to Sch¨onrich et al. (2015):

al. (2020) compared to the NSD GALCEN sample which is

vGC = vrad+14×cos(l)cos(b)+250×sin(l)cos(b)+7×sin(b).
(1)
Figure 8 shows the normalized galactocentric velocity
distribution split in negative and positive longitudes where
we conﬁrm the clear signature of the rotation of the nu-
clear stellar disk as pointed out by Sch¨onrich et al. (2015).
However, due to the larger sample size now in GALCEN, we
noticed a signiﬁcant fraction of high velocity stars exceed-
ing 300 km/s. These high velocity stars have [Fe/H] > −0.5
ruling out any possible connection to the Galactic Halo.
Are these stars originating from the Galactic Center, or
could they have been kicked up from e.g. binary supernova
explosion, the interaction of a dwarf galaxy or a globular
cluster with the disk, or interaction between multiple stars,
as proposed by Du et al. (2018)? Proper motion measure-
ments would be necessary to derive the detailed orbits of
those stars in order to understand their origin.

The velocity dispersion of the GALCEN sample is
159 km/s, with a slightly larger dispersion for the metal-
rich stars (163 km/s) with respect to the metal-poor stars
(156 km/s). We deﬁne here metal-rich (MR) and metal-poor
(MP) as in Zoccali et al. (2017) with [Fe/H] > 0.1 for MR
and [Fe/H] < −0.1 for MP. Zoccali et al. (2017) showed
based on GIBS data that while for higher latitudes the MP
population shows a larger velocity dispersion, this trend is
inverted by going closer to the plane from |b| = 1o inwards.
Clarkson et al. (2018) found based on proper motion mea-
surements that the metal-rich population shows a steeper
rotation curve. Our analysis of GALCEN conﬁrms their
results with an increasing velocity dispersion with higher
metallicity. Kunder et al. (2016) showed that metal-poor
stars such as RR Lyrae rotate much slower than RGB or
RC stars in the Bulge and suggested that they are belonging
to the classical bulge. Other studies also reveal the presence
of an old population in the Galactic Center region (see e.g.
Contreras Ramos et al. 2018, Dong et al. 2017, Minniti et al.
2016). Zoccali et al. (2017) showed some indications based
on the GIBS RC stars that MP stars show a marginally
slower rotation compared to the MR stars (see their Fig.
13). We investigated this more in detail by tracing the slope
of the MR and MP stars in the l vs. vGC plane. We use

Fig. 8. Normalized galactocentric velocity distributions for
negatives longitudes and positive longitudes (in red and
blue, respectively) as in Sch¨onrich et al. (2015). We limit
here our sample to |l| < 0.5o in order to account for the
uneven sample distribution.

a similar way in the ﬁtting procedure as Sch¨onrich et al.
(2015). Figure 9 shows a linear ﬁt of the entire GALCEN
sample (black line) as well as the ﬁt for the MR stars (red
solid line) and MP stars (blue solid line). The rotational
speed can be calculated by assuming a radius for the NSD
as shown by equation (2) assuming a typical radius R of
the NSD of 120 pc.

vrad = R0 × sin(l) × (V /RN SD − V0/R0)

(2)

where vrad is the heliocentric radial velocity, R0 =
8.2 kpc (distance to the GC), V0 = 220 km/s (sun veloc-
ity), l the galactic longitude and RNSD the radius of the
disc (120 pc).

We obtain for the best ﬁt (indicated by the blue and red
line for both the MP and MR population, respectively) a
rotation velocity of 140 ± 30 km/s for the MP stars and
of 200 ± 30 km/s for the MR stars, indicating a clearly
faster rotation for the MR stars. If we restrict our sam-
ple to |b| ≤ 0.4◦, which is the approximate vertical extent
of the nuclear stellar disc (see the Fig. 2 ), we obtain very
similar ﬁtting results. The reason of this diﬀerence in the
rotation velocity between MR and MP stars could be due
to a diﬀerent origin, e.g. MP stars could be formed from
disrupted stellar clusters. Tsatsi et al. (2017) showed that
using N-body simulation of inspiralling clusters to the cen-
ter of the Milky Way can reproduce both the morphologi-
cal and kinematical properties of the Nuclear Star Cluster.
On the other hand, Mastrobuono-Battisti et al. (2019) has
shown that, in presence of an aspherical, time-variable po-
tential (e.g. due to the presence of a discrete stellar black
hole cusp), counter rotating discs can perturb the dynamics
of older stellar populations leading to accelerated relaxation
while the younger populations show a larger amount of ro-
tation. (Younger populations always show larger rotation
compared to older ones, but the diﬀerence is even larger

both in chemical abundances and the MDF. Together with
their diﬀerent SFH, it is likely that the NSD and the NSC
have formed on diﬀerent time scales.

Fig. 9. Galactocentric radial velocity vs. galactic longitude.
The black line shows the linear ﬁt of the full GALCEN sam-
ple, while the red line the ﬁt for metal-rich stars [Fe/H] > 0
and the blue line for MP stars. The shaded area shows the
95% level of conﬁdence interval. The green points are stars
inside 0.4 degrees gal. latitude. See text for details.

footprints such as dispersion in light elements (Schiavon
et al. 2017) would be essential to understand the diﬀerent
possible formation scenarios.

8. Conclusions

Using the latest DR16 APOGEE data release, we study
cool M giants in the GALCEN sample going down to tem-
peratures of 3200 K. Among those, stellar parameters of a
bunch of known and candidate AGB/supergiant stars are
now available thanks to the cool grid of MARCS model at-
mospheres and signiﬁcant improvements in the analysis of
cool stars by the APOGEE/ASPCAP team. The known (6)
and candidate (15) AGB/supergiant stars are situated well
above the tip of the RGB, conﬁrming their status as cool
luminous stars. We conﬁrm that a photometric H–K color
cut combined with a dereddened magnitude cut of K0 is
a very powerful criterion to select AGB/supergiant stars.
We identify clearly in the MDF of GALCEN a metal-poor
peak at [Fe/H] = −0.53 dex, which is about 0.2 dex lower
than the metal-poor peak in BW. About 50% of the stars
belong to each of the MR and MP populations. The group
of AGB/supergiant stars follow the same trend in the MDF
as the normal M giants. The general α-abundances of the
GALCEN stars show a very bulge like behavior. As already
pointed out by Sch¨onrich et al. (2015), we identify the ro-
tation of the nuclear disc seen in the galactic longitude vs.
vGC diagram. Separating our sample in an MR and MP
population, we detect a much higher rotation velocity of
the MR stars with 200 km/s with respect to the MP stars
(140 km/s), indicating a diﬀerent origin of these two popu-
lations. We see evidence of clear diﬀerences in the chemical
footprints of the nuclear disc and the nuclear star clusters,
