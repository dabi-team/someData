Abstract

Using a 2D Viscoresistive Reduced MagnetoHydroDynamic (VR-RMHD) model, the magnetic

island coalescence problem is studied in the presence of in-plane, parallel shear ﬂows. Extending

the analytical work of Waelbroeck et al., Phys. Plasmas 14, 022302 (2007) and Throumoulopoulos

et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42, 335501 (2009) in the sub-Alfv´enic ﬂow shear regime for Fadeev

equilibrium, the super-Alfv´enic regime is studied for the ﬁrst time numerically. A wide range of

values of shear ﬂow amplitudes and shear scale lengths have been considered to understand the

eﬀect of sub-Alfv´enic and super-Alfv´enic ﬂows on the coalescence instability and its nonlinear fate.

We ﬁnd that for ﬂow shear length scales greater than the magnetic island size, the maximum

reconnection rate decreases monotonically from sub-Alfv´enic to super-Alfv´enic ﬂow speeds. For

scale lengths smaller than the island size, the reconnection rate decreases up to a critical value v0c,

beyond which, the shear ﬂow is found to destabilize the islands. The value of v0c decreases with

a decrease in the value of shear ﬂow length scale. Interestingly, for our range of parameters, we

ﬁnd suppression of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in super-Alfv´enic ﬂows even when the shear

scale length is smaller than the island width. Observation of velocity streamlines shows that the

plasma circulation inside the islands has a stabilizing inﬂuence in strong shear ﬂow cases. Plasma

circulation is also found to be responsible for the decrease in upstream velocity, causing less pile-up

of magnetic ﬂux on both sides of the reconnection sheet.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic reconnection (MR) is a fundamental phenomenon in dynamically evolving

plasma systems that is responsible for relaxing the magnetic ﬁeld topology by converting

the magnetic energy into kinetic energy. This phenomenon heats up the plasma [1, 2] and is

frequently observed in both laboratory and space plasma. Examples include saw-tooth crash

driven by tearing mode instability (TMI) in tokamaks [3], solar ﬂares, coronal mass ejection,

magnetospheric substorms, etc. (see [4] and references therein). The most favorable location

for two-dimensional MR to occur is the region of thin current sheet that develops at the

X-type magnetic null points (X-type null lines in 3D are topologically unstable) generated

through MHD instabilities, e.g. the TMI [5], plasmoid instability [16] and island coalescence

instability [20–31], to name a few. Any change in plasma parameters around these local X-

points is known to aﬀect the entire process of MR. A large number of numerical simulations

have been conducted to understand the role of various parameters on MR, such as the eﬀect

of non-uniform resistivity [6], presence of strong guide ﬁeld [21], presence of asymmetric

magnetic ﬁeld and density on the upstream side of reconnection current sheet [7, 8] and

more. Additionally, as the plasma bulk ﬂow is common in fusion plasma experiments (e.g.,

generated indirectly by neutral beam injection or wave heating/current driving mechanisms)

as well as in space plasma environment (e.g., caused due to plasma jets from astronomical

bodies, stellar wind, etc.), it can also aﬀect MR in many important ways by altering the

upstream and downstream ﬂow pattern.

As is well known, the magnetic ﬁeld can also aﬀect the ﬂow dynamics. For example,

the presence of magnetic ﬁeld parallel to shear ﬂow with velocity discontinuity generates

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) if the diﬀerence in velocity across the discontinuity layer

is greater than twice the Alfv´enic velocity (vA) [9, 38]. In the past, most of the research

work on MR in the presence of shear ﬂows have used two kinds of MHD equilibrium: the

Harris current sheet equilibrium [11] and the Fadeev or magnetic current island equilibrium

[18] (used interchangeably throughout this work). The Harris type equilibrium has a long

thin current sheet that separates two regions of anti-parallel magnetic ﬁeld. In the absence

of shear ﬂow, when the current sheet becomes unstable to TMI, it breaks down into large

magnetic islands through MR. However, in the presence of in-plane parallel [12, 13, 15, 16] or

anti-parallel [13, 14] shear ﬂows, the rate of island formation, equivalently the reconnection

2

rate, reduces monotonically with an increase of shear ﬂow amplitude up to a critical value,

after which the TM mode transits to the KH mode. This critical shear ﬂow amplitude for a

resistive MHD model is vA. The inclusion of Hall physics reduces the critical ﬂow amplitude

to sub-Alfv´enic values [17] enabling the KHI and TMI to couple. However, as stronger shear

ﬂows suppress the growth and size of islands, it becomes diﬃcult to study the TM generated

magnetic islands in the presence of Alfv´enic and super-Alfv´enic ﬂows. One of the drawbacks

of using the Harris type equilibrium is that the initiation of TMI driven MR requires either

an external driving force (e.g. Newton’s challenge problem [19]) or the current sheet aspect

ratio needs to be very large (thin and long current sheet). Moreover, in natural reconnecting

systems, thin current sheets develop dynamically at the X-points. However, the pre-formed

current sheet structure of Harris equilibrium is less suitable to address reconnection physics

(see Ref.

[21] for further details). Interestingly, Fadeev equilibrium [18] has such features

inherently built into it. As Fadeev equilibrium contains a 1D chain of current ﬁlaments

separated by X-type magnetic null points, in the presence of ﬁnite dissipation, the force of

attraction between the parallel current strands brings them closer leading to the formation

of a thin reconnection current sheet at the X-point and drives the MR. This self-driven

mechanism for MR is also one of the advantages of this equilibrium [21]. Mutually attract-

ing magnetic islands ﬁnally coalesce to form a bigger island.

In the past, several attempts have been made to understand the island coalescence prob-

lem. For example, stability analysis of a 2D island conﬁguration has been studied analyt-

ically by Finn and Kaw [28]. To understand the observed fast MR time scale, 2D island

coalescence problem has been studied numerically using resistive MHD [22–25], Hall-MHD

[29, 30], kinetic [26, 27], ten moment two-ﬂuid [21] and hybrid [31] simulation models. In

the above-mentioned body of work, the role of several external parameters such as system

size, guide ﬁeld strength on the properties of MR has been addressed. However, the eﬀect of

shear ﬂow on island coalescence has not been studied so far. Furthermore, Fadeev equilib-

rium has well developed current islands to couple with both sub-Alfv´enic and super-Alfv´enic

shear ﬂows. Previously, several analytical studies have reported the shear ﬂow eﬀects on the

Kelvin-Stuart [28] island conﬁguration (same as Fadeev equilibrium). Throumoulopoulos et.

al.

[35] have constructed a class of magnetic island equilibrium in presence of shear ﬂows

by solving the Grad-Shafranov equation. Considering only sub-Alfv´enic shear ﬂows that

are relevant to fusion experiments, they have shown stabilization of island equilibrium and

3

formation of pressure islands. Analytical work by Waelbroeck et. al. [34], using a resistive

MHD model, veriﬁes modest inﬂuence on the stability of magnetic islands when subjected

to a sub-Alfv´enic shear ﬂow. The aim of our present work is to understand the eﬀect of

shear ﬂow on the island coalescence problem for a wide range of values of ﬂow amplitude

(v0) from sub-Alfvenic to super-Alfvenic and for a wide range of velocity shear scale length

(av). Using the VR-RMHD model and very high resolution computer simulations, we have

investigated Fadeev equilibrium in the presence of a tan-hyperbolic ﬂow proﬁle (shear ﬂow

is symmetric and anti-parallel on both sides of magnetic islands). We ﬁnd that in line with

previous studies, the sub-Alfv´enic ﬂows have a negligible eﬀect on coalescence instability as

the time required to attain the peak value as well the magnitude of reconnection rate is close

to that in the absence of shear ﬂow. However, for super-Alfv´enic shear ﬂows and irrespective

of shear length scales (compared to magnetic island width), we show the existence of coales-

cence instability and suppression of the magnetohydrodynamic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability

(MHD-KHI). In the absence of in-plane shear ﬂow, previously reported numerical work [19]

using fully compressible resistive MHD model on island coalescence problem has shown that

the eﬀect of compressibility has no role on the reconnection rate and island dynamics. More-

over, in the case of MHD-Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (MHD-KHI), the condition for the

fastest growing mode remains unchanged for both incompressible and compressible models

[10]. Therefore to start with the simplest, nontrivial model, here we have considered an

incompressible resistive MHD model (VR-RMHD model). We also present extensive results

on its quasi-linear and non-linear fate for the entire range of parameters addressed here.

The rest of our paper is organized as follows: the VR-RMHD model and the BOUT++

numerical framework used for its study are discussed in Section II. Then, a series of bench-

mark results for the resistive island coalescence instability in the absence of in-plane ﬂow are

discussed in Section III. In Section IV, the dynamics of magnetic island - ﬂow shear system

for diﬀerent v0 and av values are discussed. Finally, our conclusions and potential future

work have been discussed in Section V.

II. NUMERICAL SETUP

We solve the VR-RMHD model in a 2D Cartesian geometry (see Ref. [22] and references

there in) using the BOUT++ framework [36, 37]. As mentioned in the preceding section,

4

this model assumes plasma as an incompressible magnetized ﬂuid i.e. ∇ · u = 0, using which

the full compressible MHD equations are simpliﬁed to the vorticity (ω)-vector potential (Ψ)

formalism. The governing equations of the ω-Ψ formalism read as [22]

∇ · u = 0,

∇ · B = 0

⊥ϕ; ux = −∂zϕ, uz = ∂xϕ, where u (= ux ˆx + uz ˆz) is the in-plane (“poloidal”) velocity of

density Jy = ˆy ·

⊥Ψ; Bx = −∂zΨ, Bz = ∂xΨ, where B (= Bx ˆx + Bz ˆz)
is the in-plane magnetic ﬁeld and Ψ is the corresponding magnetic vector potential. The

above equations are normalized as follows: length L to system length Lx, velocity to Alfv´en

velocity vA = B/

µ0ρ and time to the Alfv´enic time tA = L/vA. Here, normalized density of

plasma ρ = 1 and magnetic permeability µ0 = 1. The normalized viscosity ˆν and resistivity

ˆη are deﬁned as ˆν = ν/(LvA) and ˆη = η/(µ0LvA), where ν is the kinematic viscosity and η is

a constant resistivity. The main variables ωy and Ψ are normalized as ωyL/vA and Ψ/(BL).

The Poisson bracket is deﬁned as [f, g]z,x = (∂zf )(∂xg) − (∂xf )(∂zg).

Equations (2) and (3) are solved in a 2D uniform Cartesian grid (0 ≤ x ≤ Lx and

0 ≤ z ≤ Lz) where Lx = Lz. For the rest of the paper, we use dimensionless, normalized

quantities unless otherwise speciﬁed. Initial equilibrium current density Jy0, vorticity ωy0

Here, the parameter (cid:15) = 0.2 determines the island width, aB = 1/2π determines the sim-

ulation domain size as Lx = Lz = 4πaB = 2, Ψ1 is the perturbed vector potential with

amplitude A = 0.01. For all our simulations, we have set ˆη = ˆν = 10−4.

In the limit

of (cid:15) = 0, Fadeev equilibrium reduces to the Harris current sheet of shear width aB. Fig.

6a shows spatial proﬁles of Jy0 (left panel colormap) and Ψ0 (left panel contour) and ωy0

(right panel colormap, for av = 2aB case). Periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions are

respectively implemented along the z and x directions. In BOUT++, we have used FFT

based calculations along z direction and ﬁnite diﬀerence based calculations along x direction.

Value of Jy, Ψ, ωy and ϕ at x = 0 and 2 is zero (Dirichlet boundary). All the runs are
carried out for two diﬀerent grid sizes dx = 4 × 10−3, dz = 2 × 10−3 (Nx = 512, Nz = 1024)
and dx = 2 × 10−3, dz = 10−3 (corresponding Nx = 1024, Nz = 2048) As given in Refs.

[23, 24], the width of the reconnection current sheet (say δ) generated during island coales-

cence ∼ ˆη2/3 when ˆη ≥ 10−4. In our case, ˆη = 1 × 10−4 (corresponding δ (cid:39) 0.00215), hence

our z-directional grid size is suﬃcient enough to resolve the reconnection current sheet.

Equations (2)-(3) are solved using the BOUT++ framework which was originally devel-

oped for tokamak edge turbulence studies. The BOUT++ framework uses a ﬁnite diﬀerence

technique based 3D nonlinear solver. Recent developments and the use of “Object Oriented

Programming (OOP)” concepts of C++ language have enabled the users to solve an arbi-

trary number of coupled, general partial diﬀerential equations [36, 37]. In solving our set

of VR-RMHD equations, we have used an energy conserving Arakawa bracket method for

calculating the nonlinear terms and the implicit CVODE time solver from the SUNDIALS

[42] package. For all the runs presented here, the time solver takes a time step of 0.05tA.

To check the correctness of the newly implemented model, we ﬁrst test for energy con-
servation. In ideal-RMHD, total energy (Eideal = 1/2 (cid:82) dτ (|∇⊥ϕ|2 + |∇⊥Ψ|2)) of the system
remains conserved. Taking Jy0 (see Eq. 4) as the initial proﬁle and ˆη = ˆν = 0, Eideal(t) as

a function of time is plotted in Fig. 1. Constant Eideal(t) values at our presently working

grid sizes (1024×1024 and 2048×2048) shows energy conservation by our solver in the ideal

limit. Also, this veriﬁes negligible numerical dissipation even at large grid sizes. As can be

expected, the solver numerically sustains Fadeev equilibrium. Here, for our 2D model, the

integration is over dτ = dxdz and the operator ∇⊥ = ˆx∂x + ˆz∂z. One of the important

parameters to investigate is the reconnection rate. In literature [22], this reconnection rate

(M ) is calculated from the reconnection ﬂux ψr as M = ∂tψr (ψr = ΨX − ΨO, with ΨX

and ΨO the magnetic ﬂux at X-point and O-point, respectively). In the absence of in-plane

shear ﬂows, the line joining the O-points always aligns itself with the line x = 1 (see for

instance Fig. 2), hence it becomes easy to calculate M from the time derivative of ψr.

However, in the presence of shear ﬂows, the line joining the O-points gets twisted because of

ﬂow dynamics and it becomes numerically expensive to compute the reconnection rate from

reconnection ﬂux. Reconnection rate can also be calculated by measuring the reconnection

electric ﬁeld Ey at the X-point using Eq. 3, as Ey = −ηJy|X [20, 22]. In the absence of

shear ﬂows, the nonlinear term (ﬁrst term in right side of Eq. 3) has negligible contribution

for the calculation of Ey inside the reconnecting current sheet [22]. In the presence of shear

ﬂows, this is also found to be valid. Hence, in this work, the reconnection rate is calculated

as M = Ey = −ηJy|X for our benchmark studies in the absence of shear ﬂows as well as

studies with shear ﬂows.

ISLAND COALESCENCE WITHOUT SHEAR FLOWS: BENCHMARK

For the benchmark purpose, we have considered the resistive island coalescence problem

[22–24] without any shear ﬂow. Benchmark study uses the initial proﬁle of equilibrium Jy0
and perturbed Ψ1 (as given by Eq. 4) with v0 = 0. We have used the grid size dz = 5×10−4,
dx = 1 × 10−3. Six diﬀerent resistivity values have been considered between 5 × 10−6 and

2 × 10−4 (see Fig. 3b). Here our length scale L = 2, whereas it is L = 1 in Ref.

[22]. In the absence of in-plane shear ﬂow, the time evolution of a Fadeev equilibrium is

shown in Fig. 2, similar to Fig. 2 of Ref.

[22]. As discussed earlier, Fadeev equilibrium

is an ideal MHD equilibrium, hence when perturbed with ﬁnite resistivity, the plasma is

able to break the frozen-in condition and cross the X-point [28]. This allows the attraction

force between the current ﬁlaments to become dominant. The typical perturbation proﬁle

8

Ψ1, having a maximum of magnetic ﬂux at the X-point, further accelerates the instability.

This movement of islands towards the X-point is shown in Fig. 2a. Fig. 2b shows that the

coalescence process has started and the reconnection sheet has formed at the X-point. In

Fig 2c, the current sheet is fully developed and the reconnection rate is at its maximum.

After this, the magnetic ﬂux piles up on both sides of the current sheet causing a slow

down of the coalescence process, and hence the reconnection rate. The reconnection rate at

these time frames are marked in Fig. 3a. In Fig. 1 of Ref [22], the reconnection rate for

ˆη = 2 × 10−5 attains a peak value at t (cid:39) 7tA. Likewise in our case, as seen in Fig. 3a, Ey

peaks around t (cid:39) 3.3tA (recall that our tA is twice that deﬁned in Ref. [22]).

Furthermore, to verify the dependence of reconnection rate on resistivity, we have plotted

(b), (c) and (d) correspond to those shown in Fig. 2. Right panel shows the maximum

the maximum reconnection rate versus diﬀerent ˆη values in Fig. 3b. As reported in Ref.
[22], the reconnection rate scales as ∝ ˆη1/2 (Sweet-Parker scaling) for resistivity lower than

a critical value [32] (here, for ˆη ≤ 10−4). This clearly veriﬁes the correctness of our solver.

IV.

ISLAND COALESCENCE WITH SHEAR FLOWS

We now turn on the shear ﬂow through an initial vorticity proﬁle as given in Eq. 4. The

shear ﬂow proﬁle and simulation parameters are chosen such that in the absence of current

9

ﬁlaments ((cid:15) → 0), the KHI gets destabilized. For our presently chosen domain size (Lz)

and parameters (v0 = 1.4vA and diﬀerent values of av), we use the analytical formula given

by Miura [10] to calculate the fastest growing MHD-KHI mode (of mode number m) given

as, m = Lz/2πav. In Table I, we have listed the values of m for two diﬀerent Lz value.

FIG. 4: Growth rate of MHD-KHI mode for diﬀerent wave numbers at two diﬀerent
system size Lz = 2 (left panel) and Lz = 4 (right panel).

To verify the stability of these modes indicated, we perturb the velocity shear proﬁle with

diﬀerent mode numbers. Left panel of Fig. 4 shows the variation of growth rate for diﬀerent

modes for various av values and domain sizes. As expected, we do not get an unstable mode

for av = 2aB for domain size Lz = 2. To get an unstable mode for this velocity shear width,

we double both Lx and Lz i.e. from Lz = Lx = 2 to Lz = Lx = 4 as well as grid numbers

Nz and Nx in order to keep the grid resolution same. As shown in the right panel of Fig.

4, doubling the length Lx (for Lz = 4 case) takes the x-boundary farther from the vorticity

sheet, resulting a marginal change in growth rate of the MHD-KHI modes. The fastest

growing mode for av = 2aB and Lz = 4 is found to be m = 1.

10

Eﬀects of in-plane shear ﬂow in the island coalescence problem are studied by changing

three important parameters in the vorticity (or velocity) proﬁle: (1) ﬂow shear strength v0

(2) shear width av and (3) the direction of shear ﬂow parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic

ﬁeld. Parameters used for these simulation are given in Section II.

A. Varying ﬂow shear amplitude v0

At ﬁrst, we study the eﬀect of shear ﬂow with diﬀerent amplitude values, keeping the shear

length scale ﬁxed at av = 2aB (shear ﬂow length scale is larger than the island size, see Fig.

7a). As discussed in literature [25, 26], the x-directional width, aI, of Fadeev equilibrium

with v0 varied between 0.01vA to 1.4vA.

island system is decided by the parameter (cid:15) as aI = 2

√

(cid:15) (1 − (cid:15)/6) aB. For (cid:15) (cid:39) 0.2, aB (cid:39) aI

(for comparison , see Fig. 7a). Here, throughout this work, the velocity shear width av

is compared with aB.

In this case study, v0 is varied keeping the ﬂow shear width ﬁxed

at av = 2aB. In Fig. 5, the time variation of the reconnection electric ﬁeld is shown for

diﬀerent v0 values. From this ﬁgure, it can be observed that for lower values of shear ﬂow
amplitude (v0 (cid:46) 0.2), the Ey vs. time matches with the no-shear ﬂow (v0 = 0) curve (see

Fig. 3a). For these v0 values, three distinct phases can be identiﬁed: (a) The reconnection

rate ﬁrst increases slowly (sub-exponential increase in Ey) up to the time (cid:39) 2tA, slowly

displacing the islands from their initial positions towards the X-point. (b) The linear phase

of the coalescence instability continues up to (cid:39) 3.3tA when the peak reconnection rate is

achieved; in this phase both islands accelerate towards the X-point (exponential increase in

12

Ey) resulting in the thinning of the reconnecting current sheet. (c) This motion causes the

magnetic ﬂux to pile up on both sides of the X-point resulting in a slowing down of island

motion and decrease in the Ey value. The islands bounce back and forth several times and

ﬁnally the coalescence process completes. Hence, for lower shear ﬂow strengths (compared

to vA) and larger shear scale length (compared to aB), in-plane ﬂows negligibly aﬀect the

overall coalescence process.

For v0 ≥ 0.35vA, the slowly growing phase of Ey starts showing oscillations driven by

stronger shear ﬂows trying to peel oﬀ the islands and altering the magnetic ﬁeld proﬁle in

the vicinity of the X-point. In this phase, as v0 is increased, the magnitude of oscillation

in Ey increases.

In Fig. 5, one can observe that even when the strength of shear ﬂow

is super-Alfv´enic (v0 = 1.2, 1.4), after the initial oscillations in the ﬁrst phase, the value

of Ey continues to increase in the second phase. This indicates the survival as well as the

continuation of current island coalescence in super-Alfv´enic shear ﬂows when the initial shear

ﬂow scale length av = 2aB. Another interesting point to notice is the decrease in magnetic

ﬂux pile-up as shear ﬂow amplitude increases. up to v0 = 0.7vA, one can notice bouncing of

islands after initial merging (decrease in Ey value after peak reconnection, see Fig 5). As v0

increases further, there is no clear sign of the second peak in Ey following the ﬁrst maxima

with the Ey decreasing continuously. This indicates that with strong shear ﬂows, the rate

of ﬂux pile up reduces, causing a slowing down of merging.

In Fig. 6, the time evolution of islands is shown for v0 = 1.4vA. Fig. 6a shows the initial

proﬁles. The eﬀect of shear ﬂow can be seen in Fig. 6b where the islands get displaced

along the x-direction. Also, the vorticity proﬁle has now changed from a single sheet to an

m = 2 (m is the poloidal/z-directional mode number) like proﬁle, similar to the initial Jy

proﬁle. The velocity streamline shows plasma circulation inside the current islands. The

ﬂow speed inside the current island is much less than the outer shear ﬂow magnitude. These

rotational ﬂow inside the islands (see Fig. 6b-6c) stabilizes them against the shear ﬂow.

These stabilized magnetic islands eventually become susceptible to coalescence instability.

The plasma circulation inside the islands sets up a shear ﬂow on both sides of the current

sheet, which in turn suppresses the upstream ﬂow (ﬂow into the reconnection sheet), causing

a smaller reconnection rate. Reduced upstream ﬂow is also responsible for less pile-up

of magnetic ﬂux. After island merging, a large island survives with rotation of plasma

column. As discussed in the previous section, there is no unstable MHD-KHI mode for

13

these parameters (Lz = 2 and av = 2aB). Hence, we found that the shear ﬂow is unable to

change the shape of current ﬁlaments and overall coalescence dynamics, but the reconnection

rate decreased by ∼70% (see Fig. 7b) when v0 increases from 0 to 1.4vA. To see the eﬀect

of an unstable MHD-KHI mode on the coalescence process, we changed the shear width

(keeping Lz = 2) in the next subsection IV B and system size (Lz = Lx = 4 for av = 2aB

case) in the subsection IV C.

B. Varying velocity shear scale length av

To see the eﬀect of velocity shear length, we take av = 2aB, aB, aB/2, aB/4, and for each

av value, v0 is scanned over a range of values between 0.1vA and 1.4vA. For comparison, we

grid sizes.

have plotted the shear width of the initial vorticity proﬁles (see Eq. 4) along with the initial

Jy0(x, z = 0.5) proﬁle at the location where the width of the island is maximum. In Fig.

7a, both the velocity shear width and island width almost matches for av = aB (since island

width aI (cid:39) aB). One may expect a strong inﬂuence of shear ﬂow on the island dynamics

for shear width smaller than island width. In this section, we have discussed the evolution

of islands in presence of shear ﬂow when av = 0.25aB.

Fig. 7b shows the variation in the peak values of Ey for the full parametric scan over v0

and av. For av = 2aB, the peak Ey value decreases monotonically with the increase of v0,
as discussed in the previous section. As Ey ∝ −Jy, Ey attains its maximum value when the

14

current density in the reconnection current sheet is minimum (negatively maximum). As

av = 2aB, current islands undergo coalescence process without much distortion. Higher v0

values induce stronger plasma circulation inside the islands and this in-turn decreases the

upstream velocity of plasma into the reconnection sheet causing a monotonic decrease in

peak Ey value. However, for av ≤ aB, shear ﬂow is trying to destabilize the islands. For

av = aB, 0.5aB and 0.25aB, the peak Ey ﬁrst decreases up to a critical value of v0, we call

it v0c; these values are 0.9vA, 0.7vA and 0.5vA respectively. Up to v0c, the shear ﬂow is

not strong enough and in these cases, the peak Ey is the reconnection rate driven by the

coalescence process. For v0 > v0c, the shear ﬂow becomes stronger and tries to peel oﬀ the

islands. This peeling also changes the current distribution near the X-point, generating very

thin current sheets which we are measuring as oscillations in the temporal evolution of Ey.

Hence, here the peak Ey value is not because of coalescence driven reconnection, although

the islands coalesce after a long time (see Fig. 8). In Fig. 8a, 8b and 8c, one can clearly

notice the peeling oﬀ eﬀect of shear ﬂow on the magnetic islands. However in Fig. 8d, at

16tA, vorticity patches have been formed with ﬂow circulation coinciding with the magnetic

islands. This conﬁrms the stabilizing eﬀect of circulation on the islands. In Fig. 8e, at 37tA,

these surviving islands coalesce to form a large single island, as in the case of av > aB.

Comparison of peak Ey vs. v0 in Fig. 7b at two diﬀerent grid size is also plotted. For

v0 ≤ v0c, the peak Ey is same for both lower and higher resolution. This implies, for these

cases, the current sheet at the X-point is well resolved by lower and higher resolution.

However, for v0 > v0c, the shear ﬂow generates very thin current sheets by destabilizing

current islands. The lower resolution is not enough to resolve these thin current sheets.

This explains the data points for lower and higher resolution are matching for v0 ≤ v0c but

not matching for v0 > v0c.

As the MHD-KHI gets destabilized in anti-parallel magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration [9], shear

ﬂow anti-parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld is also tested for Fadeev equilibrium. As reported

in the literature for TMI case [14], we found no diﬀerence in the results compared to the

parallel conﬁguration discussed above. One explanation for this could be that the stabilizing

role of the ﬂow-induced plasma circulation inside the islands is independent of the direction

of shear ﬂow and the KHI gets suppressed for the range of v0 and av discussed here. Higher

values of v0 may destabilize the current island and generate KHI. Then one can observe the

diﬀerence in the growth rate of KHI in parallel and anti-parallel conﬁguration.

C. Eﬀect of varying system size Lz and Lx

As discussed in subsection IV A, there is no unstable MHD-KHI mode for av = 2aB and

Lz = Lx = 2 domain size. Hence, for av = 2aB case, we increase the domain size from

Lz = Lx = 2 to Lz = Lx = 4. The magnetic island system with shear ﬂows are perturbed

with two diﬀerent mode number m = 1 (wavelength = Lz = 4) and m = 2 (wavelength

= Lz/2 = 2).

In Fig. 4, as mentioned earlier, growth rates of MHD-KHI modes have

changed marginally when x-boundaries are taken farther. Figure 9 shows the time evolution

of magnetic islands in the presence of super-Alfv´enic shear ﬂows (v0 = 1.4vA and av = 2aB)

when perturbed with m = 1 mode. At the initial times (Fig. 9a), the strong shear ﬂow

prevents the islands to coalesce. However, as seen in Fig. 9b, 9c, 9d and 9e, the islands start

to coalesce in the later time. Moreover, due to the unstable MHD-KHI mode, the coalescing

point is not stationary at any particular x- or z-location, rather moves dynamically inside

the blue color box marked between the z-location 0.7 - 1.0 (see Fig. 9b, 9c and 9d). Hence,

for this case, reconnection rate is calculated as maximum value of Ey(x, z, t)(= −ηJy(x, z, t))

inside the blue box. In Fig. 10, one can observe a signiﬁcant change in the time variation of

Ey and hence the island dynamics, when perturbation mode number changed from m = 2

to m = 1. With m = 2 perturbation, the MHD-KHI mode is stable for both Lx = 2 and

4 case. Hence, the island dynamics and Ey are found to be almost similar for both Lx

values and the coalescing point (or the reconnection point) remains stationary at z=1 and 3

location. However, with m = 1 perturbation, the corresponding MHD-KHI mode becomes

non-linearly unstable causing the island dynamics and time variation of Ey is diﬀerent for

Lx = 2 and Lx = 4 case.

Inspite of strong m = 1 MHD-KH instability for Lx = Lz = 4

and av = 2aB, we found the magnetic island undergo coalescence process by eventually

suppressing the unstable MHD-KHI mode generated by super-Alfv´enic shear ﬂow. This

brings out the generality of our ﬁndings.

V. SUMMARY

good agreement with previously reported work for our set of parameters. We have applied

in-plane shear ﬂows, both parallel and anti-parallel to the magnetic ﬁelds. We have calcu-

lated the peak reconnection electric ﬁeld (Ey) at the X-point for diﬀerent v0 values keeping

av = 2aB. To see the eﬀect of the shear length scale, we have calculated Ey for four diﬀerent

values of av. The main ﬁndings are as follows:

1. When av > aB, irrespective of the case whether the system allows the MHD-KHI mode

to become unstable or not (decided by Lz value), the shear ﬂow is unable to change

the island shape and hence the coalescence process, but signiﬁcantly reduces the peak

Ey or reconnection rate. For our parameter set, Ey decreases by ∼70% as v0 increases

from 0 to 1.4vA.

2. For av ≤ aB, and v0 ≥ 0.5vA (super-Alfv´enic ﬂow), the MHD-KHI tries to destabilize

the magnetic islands shape. But after setting up of plasma circulation, the magnetic

islands get stabilized against the strong shear ﬂow and the island coalescence instability

dominates over MHD-KHI.

3. The plasma circulation inside the islands produces shear ﬂow at the both sides of

the reconnection sheet, thus reducing the upstream velocity and hence a reduction

19

in magnetic ﬂux pile-up. With an increase in the value of v0, the plasma circulation

becomes stronger.

4. Anti-parallel shear ﬂows have the same eﬀect on the current islands as the parallel

shear ﬂows (hence not shown).

The present study is conﬁned to a single uniform resistivity value for which the plasma

is predominantly collisional. Hence the two-ﬂuid eﬀects (Hall physics) and kinetic eﬀects

(FLR eﬀects) are safely ignored. In the case of TMI, with slab geometry, several authors

have reported a quadrupolar out-of-plane magnetic (say B||) ﬁeld induced by out-of-plane

shear ﬂow [39]. Hall physics also generates quadrupolar B|| because of Hall electric ﬁeld

[30]. Hence, strong out-of-plane ﬂows distort the Hall-induced B|| and generate secondary

islands [40]. Also, in the past, for 3D cylindrical geometry, the eﬀect of axial and helical

ﬂows on resistive TMI has been shown to be important [41]. Hence, we believe it would

be very interesting to study the eﬀect of out-of-plane ﬂows and helical ﬂows including Hall

physics and kinetic eﬀects on 2D island structure as well as 3D ﬂux tubes. These problems

will be addressed in the future.
