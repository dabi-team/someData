Abstract— In this work we study an optimal control problem
for a multi-agent system modeled by an undirected formation
graph with nodes describing the kinematics of each agent, given
by a left invariant control system on a Lie group. The agents
should avoid collision between them in the workspace. Such a
task is done by introducing some potential functions into the
cost functional for the optimal control problem, corresponding
to ﬁctitious forces, induced by the formation constraint among
agents, that break the symmetry of the individual agents and
the cost functions, and rendering the optimal control problem
partially invariant by a Lie group of symmetries. Reduced
necessary conditions for the existence of normal extremals are
obtained using techniques of variational calculus on manifolds.
As an application we study an optimal control problem for
multiple unicycles.

I. INTRODUCTION

Multi-agent systems [13] have gained a lot of attention
in the last decades due to the advances in communica-
tion, robotics and cooperative control of spacecrafts, robotic
manipulators as well as unmanned aerial and underwater
vehicles. Symmetries in optimal control have been studied
by several authors in the last decades [2], [10], [11] and the
reduction by symmetries in optimal control problems have
been a very active area of research for their applications
in robotics, aerospace engineering and locomotion among
others (see e.g., [4], [9] and references therein).

Different approaches to formation control of multi-agent
systems can be identiﬁed, e.g. as leader-follower [12],
behavior-based [1] and rigid body type formations [15],
[16], [17], [19]. We build on the last category by studying
optimal control of formation problems for systems whose
conﬁgurations evolves on a Lie group and including in our
analysis rigid body dynamics.

This work follows the research lines started in [10] for
optimal control of left-invariant systems and [8] for coordina-
tion control of multiple left invariant agents, respectively, and
also builds in previous developments for reduction of optimal
control [3], [9], [10] by studying optimal control problems
for multi-agent formations whose dynamics evolves on a Lie
group of symmetries and the kinematic of each agent is given
by a left-invariant system.

The problem studied in this work consists on ﬁnding the
absolute conﬁgurations and control inputs for each agent,

obeying the corresponding kinematics equations given by
a left-invariant control system, as well as satisfying the
formation constraints and minimizing the energy of the
agents in the formation.

One of the aims of this contribution, further than only
solving the proposed optimal control problem, consists in
introducing a new theoretical approach for the optimal co-
ordinated motion of multi-agent systems with heterogeneous
agents using variational principles, as is usual for a single
agent whose dynamics is described by a mechanical system.
The differential equations obtained from the variational prin-
ciple and representing necessary conditions for optimality
gives rise to a set of equations that can not be solved directly
with a numerical solver. We also propose a splitting in the
equations to render such a system solvable.

In this work each agent is described by a drift-free kine-
matic control system on a Lie group and agents should satisfy
the formation constraints to avoid collision with each other
in the workspace. For this task, we introduce some potential
functions corresponding to ﬁctitious forces, induced by the
formation constraints, into the cost functional for the optimal
control problem. Such potential functions are not invariants
under the group of symmetries of the agents and therefore
they break the symmetry of individual agents in the optimal
control problem. The reduction of necessary conditions for
the existence of normal extremals in the problem is described
via Euler-Poincar´e equations arising from the variational
analysis.

As an application we study an energy-minimum problem
for three unicycles and characterize the exact solution for
the control law of one of the agents. To the best of authors’
knowledge, this is one of the ﬁrst attempts where a formation
constraint for a coordination motion of unicycles is expressed
in absolute conﬁgurations on the Lie group SE(2) (a differ-
ent approach for relative conﬁgurations has been studied in
[8]), allowing to explore more the Lie group framework in
formation problems with non-compact conﬁguration spaces.
This approach can be seen as a complement to the related
literature for formation problems on Lie groups is the case of
agents evolving on the Lie group of rotations SO(3) where
the constraint is written as the geodesic distance between two
points (since SO(3) is compact and therefore a complete
manifold such a distance is well deﬁned) and the use of
Rodrigues’ formula allows the use of trackable formation
constraints.

The structure of the paper is as follows: Section II intro-
duces reduction by symmetries and Euler-Poincar´e equations.
Section III introduces the left-invariant kinematic multi-

 
 
 
 
 
 
agent control system and the formulation of the optimal
control problem for multiple agents. In Section IV we study
Euler-Poincar´e reduction of necessary conditions by using a
variational framework and splitting the dynamics to ﬁnd a
solvable system of equations. An application to the optimal
control problem of three unicycles is studied in Section V.
We conclude the work by commenting directions of future
research in Section VI.

II. PRELIMINARIES: MECHANICS ON MANIFOLDS

In this section we introduce the review material we will
use along the work. For a further covering of the topics see
[2] (Chapter 3), [7] (Chapters 6-7), and [14] (Appendix A).

A. Mechanics on manifolds

Let Q be the conﬁguration space of a mechanical system, a
differentiable manifold of dimension n with local coordinates
q = (q1, . . . , qn). Let T Q be the cotangent bundle of Q,
locally described by positions and velocities for the system
vq = (q1, . . . , qn, ˙q1, . . . , ˙qn) ∈ T Q with dim(T Q) = 2n.

The dynamics of the mechanical system is determined by
a Lagrangian function L : T Q → R given by L(q, ˙q) =
K(q, ˙q) − V (q) where K : T Q → R is the kinetic
energy and V : Q → R the potential energy. The cor-
responding equations of motion describing the dynamics
of the system are given by the Euler-Lagrange equations

B. Mechanics on Lie groups

If the conﬁguration space is a Lie group and the system
has a symmetry, one can take advantage of it to reduce the
degrees of freedom of the system and work on a lower di-
mensional system reducing computational cost and avoiding
singularities by working on a coordinate free framework in
the associated Lie algebra of a Lie group.

Deﬁnition 2.1: A Lie group is a smooth manifold G that
is a group and for which the operations of multiplication
(g, h) 7→ gh for g, h ∈ G and inversion, g 7→ g−1, are
smooth.

Deﬁnition 2.2: A symmetry of a function F : G → R is

a map φ : G → G such that F ◦ φ = F .

Deﬁnition 2.3: Let G be a Lie group with identity element
¯e ∈ G. A left-action of G on a manifold Q is a smooth
mapping Φ : G × Q → Q such that Φ(e, q) = q ∀q ∈ Q,
Φ(g, Φ(h, q)) = Φ(gh, q) ∀g, h ∈ G, q ∈ Q and for every
g ∈ G, Φg : Q → Q deﬁned by Φg(q) := Φ(g, q) is a
diffeomorphism.

We often use the notation gq := Φg(q) = Φ(g, q) and say
that g acts on q. All actions of Lie groups will be assumed
to be smooth. Let G be a ﬁnite dimensional Lie group and
g will denote the Lie algebra associated to G deﬁned as
g := TeG, the tangent space at the identity e ∈ G. Let
Lg : G → G be the left translation of the element g ∈ G
given by Lg(h) = gh for h ∈ G. Lg is a diffeomorphism
on G and a left-action from G to G [7]. Their tangent map
(i.e, the linearization or tangent lift) is denoted by ThLg :

ThG → TghG. Similarly, the cotangent map (cotangent lift)
is denoted by T ∗
h G → T ∗
ghG. It is well known that
the tangent and cotangent lift are actions (see [7], Chapter
6).

h Lg : T ∗

Let X : G → T G be a vector ﬁeld on G. The set X(G)
denotes the set of all vector ﬁelds on G. The tangent map
TeLg shifts vectors based at e to vectors based at g ∈ G. By
doing this operation for every g ∈ G we deﬁne a vector ﬁeld
as X g
ξ := TeLg(ξ) for ξ := X(e) ∈ TeG. A vector ﬁeld X ∈
X(G) is called left-invariant if ThLg(X(h)) = X(Lg(h)) =
X(gh) for all g, h ∈ G. In particular for h = e this means
that a vector ﬁeld X is left-invariant if ˙g = X(g) = TeLgξ
for ξ = X(e) ∈ g. Note that if X is a left invariant vector
ﬁeld, then ξ = X(e) = TgLg−1 ˙g.

Let Φg : Q → Q for any g ∈ G a left action on G;
a function f : Q → R is said to be invariant under the
action Φg, if f ◦ Φg = f , for any g ∈ G (that is, Φg is a
symmetry of f ). The Adjoint action, denoted Adg : g → g
is deﬁned by Adgχ := gχg−1 where χ ∈ g. Note that this
action represents a change of basis on the Lie algebra.

If we assume that the Lagrangian L : T G → R is G-
invariant under the tangent lift of left translations, that is
L ◦ TgLg−1 = L with g ∈ G, then it is possible to obtain a
reduced Lagrangian ℓ : g → R, where

ℓ(ξ) = L(g−1g, TgLg−1 ( ˙g)) = L(e, ξ).

The reduced Euler–Lagrange equations, that is, the Euler–
Poincar´e equations (see, e.g., [2], [7]), are given by the
system of n ﬁrst order ode’s

ad : g × g → g the adjoint operator given by adξη := [ξ, η],
where [·, ·] denotes the Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds on the Lie
algebra g, and where h·, ·i : g∗ ×g → R denotes the so-called
natural pairing between vectors and co-vectors deﬁned by
hα, βi := α·β for α ∈ g∗ and β ∈ g where α is understood as
a row vector and β a column vector. For matrix Lie algebras
hα, βi = αT β (see [7], Section 2.3 pp.72 for details).

Using this pairing between vectors and co-vectors, one can
write a useful relation between the tangent and cotangent lifts

hα, ThLg(β)i = hT ∗

The Euler–Poincar´e equations together with the recon-
struction equation ξ = TgLg−1 ( ˙g) are equivalent to the
Euler–Lagrange equations on G.

III. LEFT-INVARIANT KINEMATIC MULTI-AGENT
CONTROL SYSTEM AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

A. Left-invariant kinematic multi-agent control system.

Let Gi be r Lie groups of dimension n describing the
conﬁguration of r heterogenous agents and gi := Tei Gi their
corresponding Lie algebras i = 1, . . . , r with gi(t) ∈ Gi
describing the evolution of agent i at time t.

In the problem studied in this work the conﬁguration space
of each agent has the same Lie group structure. Note that
the same conﬁguration does not mean the same agent. For
instance, each agent can have different mass and inertia
values, and therefore agents are heterogeneous agents.

Along this work, we assume that a multi-agent control
system is modeled by an undirected (bidirectional) formation
graph G = (V, E, C), describing the kinematics of each agent
given by r left invariant control systems on Gi with i =
1, . . . , r together with the formation constraints.

Here V denotes the set of vertices of the graph representing
the communication topology in the multi agent system where
each vertex vi ∈ V is a left invariant control system, that is,
the kinematics of each agent is determined by

˙gi = Tei Lgi(ui),

gi(0) = gi
0,

(3)

and the set E ⊂ V × V denotes the set of edges of the
graph, s := r(r−1)
symmetric binary relations that link two
agents, where gi(·) ∈ C1([0, T ], Gi), T ∈ R ﬁxed and ui
is a curve on the Lie algebra gi of Gi. Alternatively, the
left-invariant control system (3) can be written as ui(t) =
TgiLg
˙gi, where for each i, the m-tuple of control inputs
ui = [u1
i . . . um

i ]T take values in Rm.

i

The set C is given by s (holonomic) formation constraints
indexed by the edges set cE = {φij}eij with eij = (vi, vj) ∈
E. For each edge eij, φij is a function on Gi×Gj deﬁning the
formation constraint between agents i and j. The constraint
is enforced if and only if φij (gi, gj) = 0.

If for each i, gi = span{ei

Left-invariant control systems (3) provide a general frame-
work for a class of systems that includes control design for
spacecrafts and UAV motion. In general, the conﬁguration
space for these systems is globally described by a matrix
Lie group making (3) a natural model for the controlled
system. The Lie group framework gives rise to coordinate-
free expressions for the dynamics describing the behavior of
the system. When systems on Lie groups are left invariant,
there is a globalization of solutions. That is, even if we
exploit local charts to make small maneuvers, working in
a framework of Lie groups allow us to move all over the
conﬁguration space without reformulating the controls. This
is because the absolute position of the system can always be
described as if it were the identity in the Lie group.

B. Problem formulation

Next, we are going to deﬁne an optimal control problem

for the left-invariant multi-agent control system (4).

Along this work, we will denote G = Πr
i=1Gi and g =
i=1gi, where the Lie algebra structure of g is given

i , αi : T ∗G → T ∗Gi
πi : G → Gi, τi : g → gi, χi : g∗ → g∗
and βi : T G → T Gi the canonical projections from G, g,
g∗, T ∗G and T G, respectively, over its ith-factor.

2 , . . . , ξr

We assume that each agent i occupies a disk of radius r
on G. The quantity r is chosen to be small enough so that
it is possible to pack r disks of radius r on G.

We want to ﬁnd necessary conditions for the existence of
normal extremals in an energy-minimum problem for the
left-invariant multi-agent control system (4) where along
their trajectory from a prescribed absolute initial state to
a prescribed ﬁnal absolute state not only minimize the
energy of the complete networked system to achieve the
desired ﬁnal position, but also ensure that agents avoids
collisions with each other in the workspace. This task can
be done by introducing s := r(r−1)
potential functions
corresponding to ﬁctitious forces into the cost functional
for the optimal control problem, which are induced by the
formation constraints.

2

Collision avoidance between the agents i and j is achieved
by introducing the potential function Vij : Gi × Gj → R
with i = 1, . . . , n; j = 1, . . . , s and i 6= j. We assume
that Vij may not be a (Gi × Gj)-invariant function for each
eij ∈ E (i.e., Vij(gihi, gjhj) 6= Vij (gi, gj) for some (gi, gj)
and (hi, hj) in Gi × Gj) and it is sufﬁciently regular for all
eij ∈ E.

Problem: Consider the following optimal control problem:
ﬁnd the absolute conﬁgurations g(t) = (g1(t), . . . , gr(t)) and
control inputs u(t) = (u1(t), . . . , ur(t)) minimizing the cost

ρgi (hi, ui) = (Lgi hi, ui). The cost functions Ci are not
related to collision avoidance between agents but only to
the energy minimization performance.

Remark 3.1: For a given element gi ∈ Gi, we denote ρgi :

when there is no confusion we denote ρ : G × (G × g) →
G × g the vector valued left action of G on G × g given by
ρ(g, h, u) = (Lgh, u) for g, h ∈ G, u ∈ g.

Remark 3.2: The restriction in the index j > i in the sec-
ond sum in (5) is to do not count twice the quantity of func-
tions Vij to avoid collision among agents (note that Vij =

IV. NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF
NORMAL EXTREMALS

As in [3], and [9] for the single agent case, the optimal
control problem can be solved as a constrained variational
problem by introducing the Lagrange multipliers λgi =
giGi with λi ∈ C1([0, T ], g∗) into the
T ∗

The following result gives rise to necessary conditions for

control problem.

Theorem 4.1: If the cost functions Ci : Gi × gi → R are
Gi-invariant under the left action of Gi on Gi × gi given by
ρgi : Gi × gi → Gi × gi, ρgi (hi, ui) = (Lgi hi, ui) for all
i = 1, . . . , r among the set A of admissible trajectories, the

Remark 4.1: Note that equations (6) looks like they are
not Euler-Poincar´e equations due to the g-dependency, but
we refer to them as Euler-Poincar´e type equations, with
some abuse, (also known in the literature as trivialized Euler-
Lagrange equations [4], [7]) because they comes from a
procedure of reduction by symmetries and if one considers
the order in the way these equations must be solved, the ﬁrst
equation is an equation on the dual of the Lie algebra of g.
In practice, these equations should be applied in backward
sense with respect to the index i, as illustrated below.

For instance, in the case of three agents (the one for which
we apply the reduced equations in Section V), s = 3. We
start by computing the equations when i = 3. In this case
j = 0 and therefore we only need to solve the equation
corresponding to the ﬁrst two factors in (6) since the other

part disappears for j = 0. Solving such an equation (we
shown how such equation must be computed in Proposition
4.1) we obtain u3 and λ3, and therefore using u3 and the
reconstruction equation ˙g3 = g3u3 we obtain g3. Therefore,
after this ﬁrst step we have the evolution of g3, u3 and λ3.
Next, we compute the equations when i = 2. In this case
j = 3. Solving (6) coupled with ˙g2 = g2u2, using the the
conﬁguration found for the last agent g3 in the previous step,
one is not able to solve the resulting equations and obtain the
evolution for λ2, u2 and g2 due to the interconnection term
among the agents in V13, although we have the information
to deal with V23 from the previous stage. Then, we must
couple the equations with the case i = 1, j = 2, 3. That is,
at this stage we need to go to step i = 1.

Solving such a system coupled also with ˙g1 = g1u1 we
are able to ﬁnd the evolution of λ1, λ2, u1, u2, g1 and g2,
giving rise to the motion of the agents in the workspace and
the control inputs, satisfying the formation constraints and
minimizing the cost functional (5).
⋄
Note that equations (6) can not describe completely the
time evolution of the controls and the Lagrange multipliers.
Since they are two independent variables, we must have two
equations in order to have a system of differential equations
with a well deﬁned solution. To solve such a difﬁculty we
propose the following splitting of the equations:

Proposition 4.1: If each gi and gj admits a decomposition
of the form gi = ri ⊕ si and gj = rj ⊕ sj, respectively,
where ri = span{ei
n} in
agreement with (3) and such that

for each i = 1, . . . , r, with j = 1, . . . , s where s = r(r−1)
,
then the time evolution of (6) for each i can be rewritten as

V. OPTIMAL CONTROL OF MULTIPLES UNICYCLES

As an application we consider an energy-minimum control
problem for three unicycle type robots. A unicycle is a
homogeneous disk rolling on a horizontal plane maintain-
ing its vertical position (see, e.g. [2]). The conﬁguration
of each unicycle at any given time is determined by the
element gi ∈ SE(2) ∼= R2 × SO(2), i = 1, 2, 3 given

The potential functions Vij are SO(2) × SO(2)-invariants

dynamics of the agents is broken in the optimal control
problem due to the incorporation of the formation constraints
into the cost functional.

By Remark 4.1 and using Proposition 4.1 the Euler-
Poincar´e equations giving rise to the reduced necessary
conditions for the existence of extremals in the optimal

control problem for i, j = 1, 2, 3, are computed in backward
order in the index i as follows.

Such a system of equations can not provide the evolution of
the conﬁgurations, controls and Lagrange multipliers g2, u2

and g3, and we must to couple the previous equations with
the ones for i = 1.

Solving the previous system of equations for i = 1 and i = 2
together, we can obtain the solutions for all absolute conﬁg-
urations, controls and Lagrange multipliers that permits to
move agents from a prescribed initial states to a prescribed
ﬁnal state minimizing the total energy in the multi-agent
formation and avoiding collision between the three unicycles.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

We studied reduced necessary conditions for the existence
of normal extremals in an optimal control problem for a
multi-agent formation, deﬁned by kinematic drift-free left
invariant control systems with formation constraints break-
ing the symmetry of the formation graph. Such conditions
were obtained through a non-trivial extension of variational
principles for a single agent whose dynamics evolves on a

Lie group. Such a variational principle does not allow to
describe the conditions of extremals for the optimal control
problem as a solvable and well deﬁned system of ﬁrst
order differential equations for the evolution of the agents
while at the same time minimizing the energy and satisfying
the formation constraints. We proposed a splitting into the
dynamics to make the system solvable.

As an application we studied the optimal control of
multiples unicycles and we characterized some integrability
properties to consider when one solves the corresponding
system of equations to obtain the optimal trajectories satis-
fying the formation constraints.

In a future work we will explore the incorporation of
decentralized navigation functions [5], [18], [19] into the cost
functional to avoid simultaneously collision between agents
and static obstacles in the workspace as well as agents with
limiting sensing [6].
