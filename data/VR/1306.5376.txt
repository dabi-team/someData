As a major component of the LAMOST Galactic surveys, the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey
of the Galactic Anti-center (LSS-GAC) will survey a signiﬁcant volume of the Galactic thin/thick
disks and halo in a contiguous sky area of ∼ 3, 400 sq.deg., centered on the Galactic anti-center
◦
(|b| 6 30
), and obtain λλ3800–9000 low resolution (R ∼ 1, 800) spectra for
a statistically complete sample of & 3 M stars of all colors, uniformly and randomly selected
from (r, g − r) and (r, r − i) Hess diagrams obtained from a CCD imaging photometric survey
of ∼ 5, 400 sq.deg. with the Xuyi 1.04/1.20 m Schmidt Telescope, ranging from r = 14.0 to
a limiting magnitude of r = 17.8 (18.5 for limited ﬁelds). The survey will deliver spectral
classiﬁcation, radial velocity Vr and stellar parameters (eﬀective temperature Teﬀ , surface gravity
log g and metallicity [Fe/H]) for millions of Galactic stars. Together with Gaia which will provide
accurate distances and tangential velocities for a billion stars, the LSS-GAC will yield a unique
dataset to study the stellar populations, chemical composition, kinematics and structure of the
disks and their interface with the halo, identify streams of debris of tidally disrupted dwarf
galaxies and clusters, probe the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution, map the
3D distribution of interstellar dust extinction, search for rare objects (e.g. extremely metal-poor
or hyper-velocity stars), and ultimately advance our understanding of the assemblage of the
Milky Way and other galaxies and the origin of regularity and diversity of their properties.

The survey was initiated in the fall of 2012 and expected to complete in the spring of 2017.
Hitherto, about 0.4 M spectra of S/N(λ7450) > 10 per pixel have been accumulated. In addition,
bright nights have been used to target stars brighter than 14 mag. and have so far generated
over 0.4 M spectra, yielding an excellent sample of local stars to probe the solar neighborhood.
LSP3, a set of pipelines tailored to the need of LSS-GAC, for spectral ﬂux-calibration, and radial
velocity and stellar parameter determinations, have been developed at Peking University, based
on packages developed for the SDSS and those at the National Astronomical Observatories of
Chinese Academy of Sciences. Comparisons of multi-epoch observations, with the SDSS results,
as well as applying the pipelines to open and globular clusters show that LSP3 has achieved a
−1, 110 K, 0.15 dex and 0.15 dex for Vr, Teﬀ, log g and [Fe/H], respectively.
precision of 5 km s
The data are publicly available, subject to regulations of the LAMOST data policy, and begin
to yield scientiﬁc results. The potential of LSS-GAC and power of existing data are illustrated
with examples of selected problems.

1. Scientiﬁc motivations

Galaxies are building blocks of the universe. Understanding how galaxies assemble
and acquire their characteristic structure and properties (the “grand designs”) is one
of the most challenging problems of astrophysics. In the current ΛCDM paradigm, all
cosmic structures including galaxies build up hierarchically by merging and accreting
smaller ones. Although supported by extensive observations and large scale numerical
simulations, the scenario involves many currently poorly understood and often highly
non-linear baryonic physics (e.g. star formation and feedbacks) that it is compulsory to
ﬁnd out empirically the assemblage history of galaxies via detailed study of large sam-
ples of member stars of nearby, well-resolved galaxies, and inevitably less sophisticated
statistical analysis of large samples of more distant galaxies (e.g. Mayer, Governato &
Kaufmann 2008). Both approaches depend on the acquisition of large survey samples.

The Milky Way is an archetypical disk galaxy and the only grand-design (barred)
spiral that individual constituent stars can be resolved and studied multi-dimensionally
(in 3D space position and velocity, and in chemical composition). On the other hand,
owing to our own position inside the system, the roughly 200 billion Galactic stars are
distributed over the whole sky of 4π steradian, and their views are restricted by the
ubiquitous intervening interstellar dust grains, in particular in the disk and towards the
Galactic center. The study is further hampered by the diﬃculty of obtaining accurate
distances to individual stars. Owing to the horrendous technical challenges of a complete
spectroscopic census of the Galaxy, far beyond the capabilities of all existing facilities,
hitherto progress of Galactic spectroscopic surveys lags far behind that of extragalactic,
and as a consequence, our knowledge of our own host galaxy (contents of baryonic and
dark matter, kinematics and chemical composition) is, ironically, not as complete and
precise as that of the universe as a whole.

Modern large scale surveys, represented by the extremely successful SDSS (York et al.
2000), have revolutionized our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, includ-
ing the still on-going assemblage process of the Milky Way. On the other hand, being
primarily an extragalactic program, the volume of the Galactic disk, in particular the
thin disk, sampled by the SDSS, including its Galactic extensions SEGUE (Yanny et al.
2009) and APOGEE (Eisenstein et al. 2011; M. Schultheis, this volume), is very limited.
Of the 0.7 M stellar spectra released in the SDSS DR9 (Ahn et al. 2012), a signiﬁcant
number were secured as the auxiliary data (e.g. as ﬂux or radial velocity standard stars),
with the remaining distributed in hundreds of disconnected ﬁelds, with targets selected
from a host of algorithms. It is thus diﬃcult to carry meaningful statistical analyses in
terms of the underlying stellar populations. The operation of the Chinese LAMOST (Cui
et al. 2012; Deng et al., this volume) opens up the possibility of carrying out a systematic
spectroscopic survey that samples a signiﬁcant volume of the Milky Way, in particular
the disk, the deﬁning structure that contains more than 90% of the baryonic matter and
essentially all the angular momentum of the Galaxy. Compared to the facility of SDSS,
the biggest strength of LAMOST is its sheer number of ﬁbers – 4,000, which is respec-
tively a factor of 6.25 and 4 larger than that employed in the SDSS and SDSS-II, and in
the SDSS-III. Most clear nights of the Xinglong Station where the LAMOST is located
are distributed from September to March of the coming year, peaking in December when
the Galactic anti-center (RA = 5h46m, Dec = +28◦56′) culminates around midnight.
The outer disk also suﬀers less severe dust extinction. Most important of all, the outer
parts of the Galactic disk have already revealed complex structure that is poorly under-
stood. LSS-GAC, a LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic Anti-center and a
major component of the LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Explo-

ration (LEGUE) proposed by the LAMOST Galactic Surveys Working Group, thus oﬀers
an unique opportunity to address questions key to revealing the true multi-dimensional
structure and the formation and evolution history of the Galactic disk, and of the Galaxy
as a whole. Examples of selected “puzzles” that can be tackled with the LSS-GAC in-
clude disk formation of the Milky Way and other late type spirals, secular evolution and
(in)stability to gravitational perturbations of the disk, origin of the thick disk, structures
and substructures of the outer disk [truncation, warps and ﬂares, the Monoceros Ring
and other anti-center stellar (sub)structures].

The LSS-GAC will form excellent synergy with Gaia, the forthcoming next generation
space all-sky astrometric survey (Perryman et al. 2001; A. Vallenari, this volume). With
an unprecedented astrometric accuracy of 10 micro-arcsec, Gaia will provide accurate
parallaxes and proper motions for a billion stars. Although the Gaia/RVS spectrometer
will also provide radial velocities and elemental abundances for millions of stars, they are
limited to stars brighter than 15 – 16 mag., about 2 – 3 mag. shallower than achievable
with the LAMOST. Radial velocities and basic stellar parameters (eﬀective temperatures,
surface gravities and metallicities) of millions of Galactic stars derivable from LAMOST
spectra, together with accurate distances and tangential velocities yielded by Gaia will
allow one to study the stellar populations, kinematics and the star formation and chemical
enrichment history of a signiﬁcant volume of the Milky Way in unprecedented detail.

2. Survey design

The LSS-GAC will survey a contiguous sky area of ∼ 3, 400 sq.deg., covering Galactic
longitudes 150 6 l 6 210◦ and latitudes |b| 6 30◦ (Fig. 1), and obtain λλ3800–9000 low
resolution (R ∼ 1, 800) spectra for a statistically complete sample of & 3 M stars of all
colors, uniformly and randomly selected from (r, g − r) and (r, r − i) Hess diagrams
and in (RA, Dec) spatial distribution, obtained from the XSTPS-GAC, a CCD imaging
photometric survey of ∼ 5, 400 sq.deg. using the Xuyi 1.04/1.20 m Schmidt Telescope. In
order to make eﬃcient use of observing time of diﬀerent qualities and avoid ﬁber crosstalk,
three categories of spectroscopic plates are designated, Bright, Medium-bright and Faint,
targeting sources of brightness 14.0 < r . m1, m1 . r . m2 and m2 . r 6 18.5,
respectively. The border magnitude separating B and M plates, m1, and that separating
M and F plates, m2, have values about 16.3 and 17.8, respectively, but the exact numbers
vary slightly from ﬁeld to ﬁeld, owing to the varying source density, stellar population
and interstellar extinction. In general, m1 and m2 decrease towards the Galactic plane.
Variable m1 and m2 are necessary in order to avoid discontinuities in the magnitude
distributions of stars targeted by B, M and F plates, c.f. §3 for detail. Also note that
during the early stage of the pilot survey, October 2011 – November 2011, the faint limit
of F plates was set at 19.0 instead of 18.5.

The 4,000 ﬁbers of LAMOST are distributed in a FoV of 20 sq.deg., yielding a ﬁber
density of 200 per sq.deg. On average, ∼ 1, 000 stars will be surveyed per sq.deg. outside
the thin disk (|b| > 3.5◦), implying 5 plates (allocated as 2 B, 2 M and 1 F) per pointing
position. Within |b| 6 3.5◦, the sampling is doubled. The LAMOST FoV however cannot
be arbitrarily arranged, since for the active optics to work in order to bring individual
segments of the primary and corrector mirrors into focus, there has to be a star brighter
than ∼ 8 mag. at the ﬁeld center. Given this constraint and considering that the LAMOST
has a circular FoV, ﬁeld centers are carefully chosen, yielding overlapping FoV’s, such
that the uniformity of spatial sampling over the whole survey area is maximized. The
optimization is carried out for B, M and F plates separately. In total, 1,250 pointings are
planned, including 500 B, 500 M and 250 F.

footprints of the SDSS and SDSS-II imaging surveys. White open circles denotes SDSS/SEGUE
spectroscopic plates. The cyan lines and dots delineate the equatorial coordinate system, with
the north and south celestial poles marked.

In the overlapping areas of adjacent FoV’s, ﬁbers are assigned to stars regardless
whether they have been assigned a ﬁber or not in the adjacent plates. As a result,
∼ 23% of all selected targets will actually be targeted twice, opening up the possibility
of time-domain spectroscopy for, e.g. identiﬁcations of spectroscopic binaries.

Finally, observing time under bright lunar conditions are used to target very bright
stars of magnitudes between ∼ 9 and 14. They form an excellent sample of local stars to
probe the solar neighborhood. The VB plates are implemented and scheduled separately.

3. XSTPS-GAC and target selection

To provide input catalogs for the LSS-GAC, XSTPS-GAC – the Xuyi Schmidt Tele-
scope Photometric Survey of the Galactic Anti-center was initiated in the fall of 2009 and
completed in the spring of 2011. The survey was carried out in SDSS g-, r- and i-bands
with the Xuyi 1.04/1.20 m Schmidt Telescope equipped with a 4k×4k CCD camera, op-
erated by the Near Earth Objects Research Group of the Purple Mountain Observatory.
The CCD oﬀers a FoV of 1.94◦ × 1.94◦, with a pixel scale of 1.705 arcsec. The survey
covers an area of ∼ 5, 400 sq.deg., from RA ∼ 3 to 9h and Dec ∼ −10 to +60◦, plus an
extension of ∼ 900 sq.deg. to the M 31/M 33 area. Including the bridging ﬁelds connecting
the two areas, the total survey area is close to 7,000 sq.deg (Fig. 1).

The survey was carried out under good observing conditions (but not necessarily pho-
tometric) in grey and dark nights. In a given night, ﬁelds of two adjacent stripes of
constant declinations were observed in turn, stepping the ﬁeld center in RA by half the
FoV (0.95◦, i.e. ∼ 50% overlap). The stepping in Dec between the stripes was set at 1.9◦,
yielding an overlap of ∼ 2 arcmin between two adjacent stripes. With an exposure time

of 90 sec and a dual-channel readout time of 43.2 sec, the moving of telescope pointing
direction as the observation proceeded was minimized, creating maximum uniformity
amongst the ﬁelds. To facilitate tying all the ﬁelds to a common ﬂux level (“ubercal”),
“Z-stripe” ﬁelds that straddled the borders of adjacent “normal” stripes were added. The
images were ﬂat-ﬁelded using “super-sky ﬂat ﬁelds” generated from the target images
themselves, after clipping all visible stars. Astrometric calibration was carried out using
the PPMXL catalog (Roeser et al. 2010). Aperture and PSF photometric measurements
were made using a modiﬁed DAOPHOT-based pipeline developed by the BATC group
of National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), and
then globally calibrated against the SDSS DR8 using overlapping sky areas. In total, the
XSTPS-GAC archives approximately 100 M stars down to a limiting magnitude of ∼ 19
(10σ). The astrometric accuracy is about 0.1 arcsec, and a global photometric accuracy
of ∼ 2% has been achieved.

The LSS-GAC targets are selected from the XSTPS-GAC photometric catalogs. The
philosophy is to adopt a simple yet non-trivial algorithm, as uniform as possible over
the whole survey area, such that whatever objects (e.g. white-dwarf-main-sequence bi-
naries, extremely metal-poor or hyper-velocity stars) are revealed by the spectroscopic
observations, they can be studied in a statistically meaningful way in terms of the under-
lying stellar populations (at least for the survey volume), after various selection eﬀects
introduced by the input catalog, those imposed by the constraints of instrument and
observation (e.g. the positioning of ﬁeld center, the holes in focal plane produced by the
guiding CCDs and the central Shack Hartmann Sensor, allocations of ﬁbers, spectral
S/N’s, etc) have been properly taken into account. Meanwhile in order to increase the
discovery space, rare objects of extreme colors (e.g. white dwarfs, red giants) should be
preferentially targeted (Fig. 2).

The XSTPS-GAC photometric catalogs are ﬁrst used to generate a clean sample, with
the requirements that: 1) The stars are detected in at least two bands, including r-band,
and have 14.0 < r 6 18.5; 2) The star positions measured in diﬀerent bands agree within

0.5 arcsec; 3) They are not ﬂagged as galaxies or star-pairs in either r- or i-band; 4) They
have no neighbors within 5 arcsec that are brighter than m + 1 mag., where m is the
magnitude of star concerned, and are not neighbors of extremely bright stars.

To select targets, we ﬁrst need to estimate values of m1 and m2, the border magnitudes
between B, M and F plates (c.f. §2 for detail). For each survey area in a (RA, Dec) box
of one degree wide, stars of extremely blue colors, g − r or r − i 6 −0.5, and of extremely
red colors, g − r or r − i > 2.5, are ﬁrst selected. Stars in the remaining color space are
then selected using a Monte Carlo method. First two random numbers, r in the range
(14, 18.5] and c in (−1, 5], are generated. If −1 < c 6 2, then the (r, g − r) Hess diagram
is used, assuming g − r = c + 0.5, otherwise the (r, r − i) Hess diagram is used instead,
assuming r − i = c − 2.5. For each (r, g − r) or (r, r − i) set, if there are stars on the
Hess diagram in a box centered on the simulated set of color-magnitude and of length
0.2 in magnitude and 0.3 in color, then the star of color-magnitude values closest to the
simulated set is chosen and removed from the pool. If not, the process is repeated until
a total of 1,000 stars, including those of extreme colors, per sq.deg. are selected. The
stars are then sorted in magnitude from bright to faint. Then m1, the border magnitude
separating B and M plates is set to the faint end magnitude of the ﬁrst 40% sources, and
m2 separating M and F plates is set to the faint end magnitude of the ﬁrst 80% sources.
The above procedure applies to the survey area of |b| > 3.5◦, where the LSS-GAC
plans to sample 1,000 stars per sq.deg. For |b| 6 3.5◦, the target density is doubled and
2,000 stars per sq.deg. are selected. In addition, in this case the selections are carried out
in (l, b) instead of (RA, Dec).

Once the values of m1 and m2 are set, stars of B, M and F plates are selected, in
batches of 200 stars per sq.deg. For each category, up to 10 batches can be selected
pending on the availability of sources. The ﬁrst batch of stars are assigned the highest
observational priority, the second one priority lower, and so forth. In selecting each batch
of stars, if a star of a given coordinate set, (RA, Dec) or (l, b), is selected, then stars in

its vicinity of 2 arcmin are removed from the pool. Those stars are however put back to
the pool when selecting the next batch of stars.

For each selected ﬁeld center (c.f. §2) and plate category (B, M or F), ﬁbers are
assigned to stars selected above according to their priorities by running through SSS, the
LAMOST Survey Strategy System, assuming a nominal observing date and time. Fibers
targeting blank sky for the measurements of sky background, typically 320 per plate,
are also allocated. Excluding dead ﬁbers (∼ 100), generally ∼ 3, 500 ﬁbers are available
for the LSS-GAC targets per plate. The SSS has to be rerun near the actual observing
date, to allow for the time-dependence of transformation between the equatorial and
focal plane coordinate systems and to ensure enough guiding stars are accessible. The
changes of stars that eventually get allocated a ﬁber and observed are generally small,
typically on the level of a few tens or less.

The above survey strategy and target selection algorithm are tested using mock cat-
alogs generated from the Besan¸con Galactic model (Robin et al. 2003). As an example,
for a 1◦ wide stripe of 56.7 sq.deg. centered at l = 180◦ and stretching from b = −30
to +30◦, the model yields 396,075 stars of 14 < r 6 18.5 mag. Amongst them, 0.018,
2.3 and 2.1% are M, K and G subgiants/giants, respectively, and 1.9, 24, 39, 24 and
4.3% are respectively A, F, G, K and M dwarfs. Running this mock catalog through the
above target selection algorithm, one ﬁnds that in total 64,029 of all stars, 99, 47 and
27% of all M, K and G subgiants/giants, 39, 14, 8, 19 and 55% of all A, F, G, K and
M dwarfs, will be selected and targeted by the LSS-GAC, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the
spatial distributions of various types of star targeted in the (X, Z) plane of Galactic
radius and height.

4. Survey status

After the completion of construction in June 2009, LAMOST went through a two-
year period of commissioning and performance characterization and optimization. The
problem of ﬁber-positioning was solved using an innovative technique. The 4,000 ﬁbers
are divided into 160 groups. For each group, the 25 adjacent ﬁbers are utilized to target 25
bright stars, with predeﬁned oﬀsets following a given pattern. The measured throughput
ratios of stellar and sky light of the 25 ﬁbers are then used to estimate the average
ﬁber positioning error of this group of ﬁbers in the focal plane. With this method, the
distribution of ﬁber positioning errors can be mapped out with a single exposure, even
under non-photometric conditions (Yuan et al., in preparation). Slit masks of 2/3 the

8

X.-W. Liu et al.

ﬁber diameter were also introduced, increasing the spectral resolution from ∼ 1, 200 to
1,800, comparable to that of SDSS, at the expenses of 20% loss of light.

Following the commissioning period, a pilot survey of one year was initiated in the
fall of 2011, to further test and optimize the survey strategy. Constant monitoring of the
LAMOST performance shows that for large scale surveys, a limiting magnitude of 17.8
is probably realistic. Under exceptional conditions (a few nights per months), a depth of
18.5 mag. can be reached for limited number of ﬁelds.

The LAMOST formal surveys were initiated in the fall of 2012. Hitherto, within the
LSS-GAC footprint, ∼ 0.15 and 0.25 M spectra of S/N(λ7450) > 10 per pixel (∼ 1.7 ˚A)
have been collected during the periods of pilot and formal surveys, respectively. In ad-
dition, ∼ 0.4 M spectra from the VB plates (some outside the LSS-GAC footprint) have
been obtained. The spatial distributions of those sources are shown in Fig. 4.

5. Data reduction

The LAMOST 2D, 1D and stellar parameter pipelines have been developed at the
LAMOST Operation and Development Center (Luo et al., this volume). There are how-
ever issues speciﬁc to the LSS-GAC, and a set of pipelines, LSP3, tailored to the need of
LSS-GAC have been developed at Peking University (PKU).

Owing to high dust reddening in the disk (EB−V ∼ 0.3 towards Galactic anti-center
sightlines) ﬂux calibration standards, such as F turnoﬀ stars adopted by the SDSS, cannot
be reliably identiﬁed and selected from the photometric colors alone. On the other hand,
stars of all types and colors are targeted by the LSS-GAC. LSS-GAC spectra are ﬁrst
processed using nominal spectral response curves (SRCs). The initial stellar parameters
are then derived using the LSP3. Based on the results, 5 – 10 F stars [5, 500 < Teﬀ <
7, 000 K and log g (cm s−2) > 3.0] per spectrograph are selected as the ﬂux calibration
standards. Extinctions towards those stars are deduced by comparing the photometric
colors to those calculated from the Kurucz low-resolution model spectra (Castelli &
Kurucz 2004) of the same stellar parameters. The SRCs are then derived by comparing
the observed spectra with the synthetic spectra of Munari et al. (2005), interpolated to the
corresponding stellar parameters and degraded to the LAMOST spectral resolution, and
then reddened assuming the reddening derived above. The Fitzpatrick (1999) extinction
law of R = 3.1 is adopted. The spectra are then reprocessed using the newly deduced
SRCs and values of stellar parameters are updated. The above process is iterated (twice
is suﬃcient) to yield the ﬁnal ﬂux-calibrated spectra.

As a test of the accuracy of our ﬂux-calibration procedure, colors are calculated
from the calibrated spectra and compared to the photometric values. For spectra of
S/N(λ4650) > 30 per pixel (∼ 1 ˚A), we ﬁnd ∆(g − r) = 0.02 ± 0.06 mag on average. For
(r − i), the spectra yield colors about 0.06 ± 0.04 mag. bluer than the photometric values,
owing to the fact that the LSP3 has opted to not to correct for the telluric absorption
bands, most notably in the i-band. Comparisons of the LAMOST and SDSS DR7 spectra
of common objects show that for high extinction regions, the LSP3 yields more realistic
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) than the SDSS. Finally, comparisons of the spectra
obtained at diﬀerent epochs indicate a calibration accuracy of better than 8% for the
wavelength range λλ4000–9000. The SRCs are found to vary with time, by as much as
20% in a given night and even larger for diﬀerent nights. The reasons are unclear. For
the moment, it seems essential to derive SRCs for each observed plate.

The LSP3 derives stellar parameters by matching the observed spectra to the empirical
spectral library MILES (S´anchez-Bl´azquez et al. 2006). Compared to the ELODIE library
(Prugniel & Soubiran 2001), the MILES library has the advantage that they are obtained

with a spectral resolution (2.3 ˚A), comparable to that of LAMOST, and carefully ﬂux-
calibrated. Both libraries have similar numbers of stars and parameter space coverage,
with the parameters determined from high resolution spectroscopy. For radial velocity
determinations, the ELODIE 3.1 library is used.

To obtain the initial values of radial velocity Vr and stellar parameters Teﬀ , log g
and [Fe/H] of a target spectrum, we ﬁrst normalize the spectrum in a way similar to
the SSPP (Lee et al. 2008), using a ninth and fourth order polynomial for the blue-
(λλ3800–5800) and red-arm (λλ6100–9000) spectra, respectively, and compare the results
to the normalized MILES spectra. The biweight means and standard deviations of stellar
parameters of the best 20 matches are then adopted as the initial parameters of the target
spectrum. The initial Vr is then obtained by cross-correlating with the best match.

For further iterations, we ﬁrst ﬁx Vr and select a 3D box in the Teﬀ, log g and [Fe/H]
parameter space centered at the initial values. The sizes of box are set to 3 times the
standard deviations of initial values or values 0.2×Teﬀ in Teﬀ, 1.0 dex in log g and 1.0 dex
in [Fe/H], whichever is bigger for each of three quantities. The observed target spectrum,
un-normalized, is then matched with the MILES spectra, again un-normalized, in the
box. To account for the possible eﬀects of interstellar extinction and uncertainties in
ﬂux-calibration, a third order polynomial is allowed to scale the SEDs of MILES spectra
to that of the target. The optimization is carried out separately for two wavelength
ranges, λλ4000–5500 and λλ6100–6800, using both the minimum χ2 and maximum cross-
correlation techniques. Strong city light emission lines and night sky emission lines, e.g.
the Hg i λ4358 and [O i] λλ6300,6363, are masked out. With the newly determined stellar
parameters, Vr is then redetermined using the ELODIE library. The process is repeated
until Vr varies less than 3.0 km s−1 in two consecutive iterations. In most cases, the results
converge in one or two iterations. The biweight means of stellar parameters of the four
best templates in the ﬁnal iteration are then adopted as the ﬁnal values of the target
spectrum. Currently, only results from the blue wavelength range are used.

Figure 6. Radial velocities and stellar parameters determined from 197,821 spectra of B, M
and F plates (top panels) and 393,791 spectra of VB plates (bottom panels) of S/N(λ4650) > 10
per pixel. Only one-in-ten stars are shown. In the left two panels, the cyan dashed line shows
the isochrone of metallicity [Fe/H] = −1 and age 10 Gyr, while the three red lines, from left to
right, show the isochrones of [Fe/H] = 0 and ages 1, 3 and 10 Gyr, respectively. The Teﬀ – log g
plane is divided into diﬀerent regions. The fractions of stars of individual regions are labeled.

Comparisons of multi-epoch observations, and with the results of RAVE (Steinmetz
et al. 2006) and SDSS show that for F, G and K stars, the LSP3 has achieved an
accuracy of 8 and 5 km s−1 for S/N(λ4650) > 10 and 20, respectively. For hotter stars, the
uncertainties are ∼ 20 and 7 km s−1 for S/N(λ4650) & 10 and 20, respectively. For stellar
parameters, the uncertainties are about 110 K, 0.15 dex and 0.15 dex for Teﬀ , log g and
[Fe/H], respectively. The stellar parameters yielded by LSP3 agree well with those given
by ULySS (Koleva et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2012), a pipeline based on the ELODIE library.
Fig. 5 compares the LSP3 radial velocities and stellar parameters determined from SDSS
spectra with those of SDSS DR7 for member stars of two open clusters and two globular
clusters. Some artifacts are clearly visible in the distributions of LSP3 parameters, owing
to incomplete or sparse parameter coverage of the MILES stars, in particular at low
metallicities. Eﬀorts are underway to ﬁll the gaps in parameter space of the MILES
library by obtaining additional spectra using the NAOC 2.16 m telescope.

Fig. 6 shows distributions of radial velocities and stellar parameters determined for
197,821 spectra of S/N(λ4650) > 10 per pixel obtained with B, M and F plates, and for
393,791 spectra obtained with VB plates. Artifacts apparent in the SDSS DR7 and DR9
releases, e.g. two false branches of stars in the Teﬀ – log g HR diagram, one near the turn-
oﬀ stars (Teﬀ ∼ 6, 200 K) and another at low temperatures (4, 000 . Teﬀ . 4, 800 K), are
no longer present. The LSP3 also seems to yield stellar parameters in better agreement
with the theoretical isochrones.

6. Examples of application

Although the LSS-GAC survey and data reduction are still in early stage, nearly one
million spectra and resultant radial velocities, stellar parameters are already available
for scientiﬁc exploitation. Taking advantage of the large number of spectra oﬀered by
the SDSS/SEGUE and using an innovative technique of paring stars of high extinctions
with those of very low or nil extinctions but otherwise of identical stellar parameters,
Yuan & Liu (2012) report the detections of diﬀuse interstellar bands towards thousands of
sightlines of Galactic stars. The same technique has been utilized to derive the extinction
coeﬃcients and study the extinction law towards thousands of sightlines (Yuan, Liu &

distributions traced by diﬀerent types of star.

Xiang 2013). Applying this technique to the LSS-GAC data, Yuan et al. (this volume) has
produced 3D extinction maps of the outer parts of Galactic disk. In spite of the incomplete
sky coverage, distinct features, such as the Perseus and Outer Arms, and eﬀects of warps
of the outer disk, are clearly visible in the deduced extinction maps. In the work, once
the extinction towards the sightline of a given star has been determined by combining
the XSTPS-GAC and 2MASS photometry, given the Teﬀ, log g and [Fe/H] parameters
yielded by LSP3, the star’s distance is then estimated by ﬁnding the closest model in the
Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database (Dotter et al. 2008) except for red clump stars
(RCs). Reliability and accuracy of the algorithm are tested using multiple observations,
star clusters and the Hipparcos distances of stars in the MILES and ELODIE libraries.
We ﬁnd that the algorithm yields distances accurate to ∼ 15 and 30% for dwarfs and
giants, respectively, when the spectra have S/N(λ4650) > 15. However, we also ﬁnd
that the distances thus derived are systematically smaller than the Hipparcos values by
respectively ∼ 6 and 12% for dwarfs and giants. RCs are good standard candles and easily
identiﬁable in the Teﬀ – log g HR diagram, falling in the region of 4, 500 < Teﬀ < 5, 200 K
and 2 < log g (cm s−2) < 3. Their distances are calculated assuming absolute magnitudes
Mi = 0.189 and MKs = −1.567 (Gronewegen 2008), with an estimated accuracy of
∼ 10%. Currently, a Bayesian approach as proposed by Burnett & Binney (2010) is
being considered for implementation in order to determine stellar distances, ages, masses
and metallicities simultaneously.

Liu et al. (2012) ﬁnd that the radial velocities of a sample of 697 RCs observed with
the MMT 6.5 m telescope show a bifurcation distribution split by 30 km s−1, peaking
at Galactic radius of ∼ 10 kpc, in coincidence with the location of the Perseus arm,
and interpret the result as evidence of the presence of the outer Lindblad resonance of
the Galactic bar, although the possibility of the corotation resonance of the spiral arms
can not be ruled out. The left panels of Fig. 7 show the radial velocity distributions of
thousands of disk G, F, A dwarfs and RCs from the LSS-GAC survey in the direction
of Galactic anti-center. Bifurcation is clearly seen in all cases, peaking at diﬀerent radii,
from the solar neighborhood to ∼ 11 kpc, in line with the expected survey depths of
individual types of tracer of concern here. In fact, a bifurcation distribution is seen in
all directions, from longitudes 150 to 210◦ and of Galactic heights |Z| 6 0.8 kpc, casting
doubt upon a resonant interpretation.

The right panels of Fig. 7 show metallicity distributions traced by diﬀerent types of
star. While the data including distances need to be carefully checked, they have already

shown some interesting trends, e.g. signiﬁcant vertical but marginal radial gradients. It is
also interesting to note that RCs seem to indicate a clear radial gradient beyond 10 kpc.
In conclusion, the LSS-GAC is well under way and poses to make major contributions
to our understanding of the stellar populations, kinematics, and the chemical enrichment
and star formation history of the Milky Way.

Discussion
Nissen: You mentioned the possibility to measure [α/Fe] and [C/Fe]. Do you have any
results on that already?

Liu: Not yet. The possibility is demonstrated by Marstellar et al. (2009, AJ, 138, 533) and
Lee et al. (2011, AJ, 141, 90), although we believe the methods need careful calibration.

Binney: Are you delivering distances in parallel with the other parameters? Can you
say something about the accuracy of your distances?

Liu: Yes, extinctions and distances will be released along with the LSP3 parameters,
and can be obtained from the author (XWL) upon request, subject to regulations of the
LAMOST data policy. A brief discussion of the accuracy is presented in §6.

Ludwig: What is the data policy of the LSS-GAC survey? Will and if so when will the
data be released to the community?

Liu: LSS-GAC is parts of the LAMOST surveys and follows the same data policy.
