Figure 1. We explore the potential of nonhuman avatars in VR games. The evaluation of our three escape room games for different animal types reveals
that players enjoy the control over additional body parts, as such morphologies allow novel, refreshing interactions and enable superhuman abilities.

ABSTRACT
Virtual reality setups are particularly suited to create a tight
bond between players and their avatars up to a degree where
we start perceiving the virtual representation as our own body.
We hypothesize that such an illusion of virtual body ownership
(IVBO) has a particularly high, yet overlooked potential for
nonhumanoid avatars. To validate our claim, we use the exam-
ple of three very different creatures—a scorpion, a rhino, and a
bird—to explore possible avatar controls and game mechanics
based on speciﬁc animal abilities. A quantitative evaluation
underpins the high game enjoyment arising from embodying
such nonhuman morphologies, including additional body parts
and obtaining respective superhuman skills, which allows us
to derive a set of novel design implications. Furthermore, the
experiment reveals a correlation between IVBO and game
enjoyment, which is a further indication that nonhumanoid

INTRODUCTION
The choice of our virtual representation, our avatar, has a
strong inﬂuence on how we perceive a game. Hence, introduc-
ing novel avatar kinds, beyond stereotypes such as knights and
wizards, is a viable option to create refreshing and engaging
player experiences. This choice applies even more for virtual
reality (VR) games, because such immersive setups are capa-
ble of amplifying the bond with our virtual self. That bond
can be strong enough such that we start perceiving the virtual
representation as our own body—a phenomenon also known
as the illusion of virtual body ownership (IVBO) [61].

 
 
 
 
 
 
By a smart choice of avatars, VR games could allow us to
collect impressions and experiences that would not be possi-
ble or would be far less engaging in a nonimmersive setup.
One prominent example is games focused on nonhumanoid
creatures, be it real animals or mythical creatures. Even
though players enjoy “beastly” non-VR games, such as Black
& White [32] and Deadly Creatures [44], similar scenarios are
offered very rarely. Especially in VR, where presence and the
IVBO effect could signiﬁcantly intensify our experience when
using animal abilities, games like Eagle Flight [68] remain an
exception.

We see manifold reasons why that potential remains unful-
ﬁlled, including the very few studies on creature embodiment
in VR, which makes it difﬁcult for game designers to predict
whether and how players will perceive animal avatars. Further-
more, as only a few games have touched upon this topic, best
practices and design guidelines for such avatars are lacking.
In other words, we need further research to understand the
challenges and opportunities induced by the nonhuman mor-
phology, e.g., additional limbs and their inﬂuence on IVBO,
differing postures, and possible control approaches.

Our paper makes two contributions. First, we explore nonhu-
manoid avatars in VR using escape room games built around
three very different animals: a rhino, a scorpion, and a bird
(cf. Figure 1). Each game explores a different control mech-
anism and focuses on distinct “superhuman” skills that are
typical for these animals. Our evaluation underpins the re-
sulting high player enjoyment, especially from these animal
abilities and additional body parts, such as horns, tails, or
wings. Accordingly, we draw design implications for animal
avatars and present our lessons learned during the design of
such VR games.

Our second contribution is the investigation of IVBO in such
scenarios. We study how the nonhuman morphology inﬂu-
ences our ability to embody such avatars in VR games. In
particular, our evaluation reveals correlations between IVBO,
game enjoyment, and presence, and conﬁrms that additional
body parts and skills are not an obstacle for inducing IVBO.
Hence, we assume that our work will motivate researchers
and practitioners to reconsider IVBO-enabled nonhumanoid
avatars as an important component of player experience in
VR.

RELATED WORK
As our research targets virtual environments, we begin with a
brief introduction of the related VR terms before focusing on
the embodiment of nonhumanoid avatars. Nowadays, VR has
regained attention mostly because of affordable mainstream
HMDs, such as HTC Vive [11], which allow players to experi-
ence games from a novel perspective. Thereby, researchers [5,
56] usually refer to immersion [9] as the technical quality of
VR equipment and apply the term presence [62, 58] to de-
scribe the impact of such devices on our perception. In our
case, we are particularly interested in presence, which can
be measured as proposed by, e.g., IJsselsteijn et al. [17] and
Lombard and Ditton [34].

Immersive technologies not only allow us to experience such
a “feeling of being there” [16], but also increase our ability
to emphasize our virtual self-representation. We can embody
our avatar to a remarkable degree, which is also referred to as
the illusion of virtual body ownership (IVBO) [35], agency, or
body transfer illusion.

IVBO originates in the effect of body ownership. The initial
experiments by Botvinick and Cohen [7] introduced the rubber
hand illusion: the participant’s arm was hidden and replaced by
an artiﬁcial rubber limb, and stroking both the real and virtual
arms created the illusion of actually owning that artiﬁcial
limb. After further investigations [67], researchers proposed a
number of models [66, 13, 43, 30] to explain such an interplay
between external stimuli and our internal body perception.

Slater et al. [59] and Banakou et al. [3] transferred the original
body ownership effect, including the underlying visuotactile
stimulation, to virtual environments. However, in their later
work, Slater et al. [61] and Sanchez-Vives et al. [53] revisited
the stimuli correlations and concluded that sensorimotor cues
are more important than the visuotactile cues, which is an
important insight, as VR setups seldom include tactile stimu-
lations. To complete the picture, apart from visuotactile and
sensorimotor cues, the IVBO effect is mainly impacted by vi-
suoproprioceptive cues (perspective, body continuity, posture
and alignment, appearance, and realism) [60, 61, 42, 37].

IVBO was mainly explored with anthropomorphic characters
and realistic representations [35, 31, 18]. For instance, related
to the question of avatar customization in games, Waltemate
et al. [69] showed that customizable representations lead to
signiﬁcantly higher IVBO effects.

A strong IVBO can produce various changes in player behav-
ior [20, 38], resembling the Proteus Effect by Yee et al. [76].
For instance, the work by Peck et al. [41] revealed a signif-
icant reduction in racial bias when players embody a black
character. Similarly, virtual race can also affect the drumming
style [22]. Other reactions are childish feelings arising from
embodying child bodies [3] and an increase in perceived sta-
bility when having a robotic avatar [36]. Hence, prior work
indicates that IVBO can be used to evoke speciﬁc feelings and
attributes [25]. We suggest that a strong bond to the creature
caused by IVBO can also increase our involvement with envi-
ronmental issues [1, 4] and our empathy for animals, which,
in turn, is transferable to human-human empathy, as shown by
Taylor et al. [64].

Researchers have also expressed interest in studying IVBO
beyond human morphology. For instance, Riva et al. [48]
posed the following question: But what if, instead of simply
extending our morphology, a person could become something
else- a bat perhaps or an animal so far removed from the
human that it does not even have the same kind of skeletonâ ˘A ˇT
an invertebrate, like a lobster? Interestingly, embodying a bat
is even being discussed in philosophy [39]. If we consider
exotic body compositions, as in the case of a lobster, that have
few properties in common with our human body, the idea of
sensory substitution [2] might play an important role. One
might also consider such substitution mechanisms as playful

interactions: e.g., the echolocation feature of a bat could be
replaced by tactile feedback in a VR game.

Given the extreme diversity of real and ﬁctional creatures, it
is difﬁcult or even impossible to research IVBO for virtual
animals as a whole. Instead, previous research tackled isolated
modiﬁcations of body parts. For instance, Kilteni et al. [24]
were able to stretch the virtual arm up to four times its original
length without losing IVBO. Normand et al. [40] used IVBO
to induce the feeling of owning a larger belly than in reality.
As a ﬁrst step toward generalization, Blom et al. [6] concluded
that strong spatial coincidence of real and virtual body part is
not mandatory to produce IVBO.

Certain animals, such as scorpions or rhinos in our study, have
additional body parts that players might want to control. In
this respect, prior work [14, 15] conﬁrmed that having an
additional arm preserves IVBO and induces a double-touch
feeling. Steptoe et al. [63] reported effects of IVBO upon
attaching a virtual tail-like body extension to the userâ ˘A ´Zs
virtual character. Clearly, these ﬁndings are relevant for a
plethora of real and ﬁctive nonhumanoids, such as dragons.
The authors also discovered higher degrees of IVBO when the
tail movement is synchronized with the real body.

To remain brieﬂy with the example of a dragon as an avatar:
Egeberg et al. [12] proposed different ways wing control could
be coupled with sensory feedback, and Sikström et al. [57] as-
sessed the inﬂuence of sound on IVBO in such scenarios. Won
et al. [74] further analyzed our ability to inhabit nonhumanoid
avatars that have additional body parts.

Closely related to our research, the works-in-progress paper
by Krekhov et al. [27] also suggested embodying virtual an-
imals in VR games. In their preliminary, explorative study,
the authors implemented different control approaches for vir-
tual tigers, bats, and spiders, and reported tendencies that
IVBO remains intact for such avatars. We continue that work
by building on the lessons learned regarding full-body and
half-body control approaches, yet focus on embedding this
knowledge into games research.

Naturally, we need a way to measure and compare IVBO
strength in order to investigate whether and how IVBO inﬂu-
ences player experience. In this regard, we point readers to
the recent work by Roth et al. [49] that introduced the alpha
IVBO questionnaire based on a fake mirror scenario study.
The authors suggested acceptance, control, and change as the
three factors that determine IVBO. As the study by Krekhov
et al. [27] relied on this questionnaire to study animal em-
bodiment in VR, we applied the same process to generate
comparable results.

A body of literature related to the control of animal avatars
should be mentioned in this context. Leite et al. [29] experi-
mented with virtual silhouettes of animals that were used like
shadow puppets and controlled by body motion. For 3D cases,
Rhodin et al. [45] applied sparse correspondence methods to
create a mapping between player movements and animal be-
havior and tested their approach with species such as spiders
and horses. As a next step, Rhodin at al. [46] experimented
with the generalization of wave gestures to create control possi-

cage and had to escape through the top right door (marked yellow). The
blue marked rods could be used for rests between the exhausting ﬂights

bilities for, e.g., caterpillar crawling movements. Our research
extends these methods by presenting additional mechanisms
tailored to animal avatar control.

THE VIRTUAL ANIMAL EXPERIENCE
Our main goal is to understand the beneﬁts and limitations
of animal avatars in VR games. Unfortunately, prior work
indicates that we cannot overgeneralize such research, because
animals vary greatly among themselves, be it regarding their
skeletons, or postures, or motion. Hence, we focus on a sound
methodology for a few sufﬁciently distinct representatives and
provide in-depth insights how such avatars can be embedded
in a gaming context. In particular, this section describes our
reasoning regarding the choice of animals and their controls,
as well as a quantitative evaluation of the outcomes.

Choosing Virtual Animals
One of the main questions to be asked when designing a game
with nonhumanoid avatars is which creature to pick. Ob-
viously, this choice is determined by various game design
aspects that are not speciﬁc to animal avatars. However, the
inclusion of such creatures adds degrees of freedom that need
to be considered. We focus on two main aspects: the increased
interaction design space and the induced challenges in control-
ling such avatars.

In the ﬁrst place, playing an animal allows us to naturally
inhibit the respective superhuman skills, such as ﬂying as a
bird or exploring underwater scenes as a dolphin. We postulate
that such natural interactions could be intuitive and easy to
learn when done right. Furthermore, the IVBO effect can
intensify [3, 36] our perception of such actions due to the
increased bond to our avatar compared to non-VR games.

These additional skills are often bound to additional body parts
of nonhumanoid creatures. Fortunately, prior work [74] indi-
cates that such additions do not necessarily destroy the IVBO

Figure 3. Rhino Room. Players had to mimic the rhino posture (left) and escape from a burning zoo. The blue marked water tap (middle) had to be

effect and can still be intuitively controlled by players [12]. In
this respect, we recommend designing the avatar such that the
altered morphology is perceived as an extension to our body,
instead of being a restriction. For instance, Krekhov et al. [27]
reported that players liked the large wings of a bat because
they felt like arm extensions and helpful tools, but disliked
tiger paws that felt shorter than their actual limbs.

A second important aspect to be considered when designing
such games is how the creature should be controlled by the
player. To embody animal avatars, it is reasonable to synchro-
nize the movements of the players as precisely as possible
with their virtual representation [53]. However, typical room-
scale VR equipment tracks only the players’ heads and hands.
We see three approaches to overcome that barrier: relying
on only three tracked positions, including markerless track-
ing [75], or requiring tracking extensions, such as the HTC
Vive Trackers [11].

Even when full-body tracking is available, the question still re-
mains how animals with signiﬁcantly different postures should
be controlled. A prominent example is creatures with non-
upright postures, such as typical mammals. A straightforward
way would be to crawl on all fours as a player to achieve the
most realistic mapping. However, this might cause exhaus-
tion over a longer period of time. As a remedy, half-body
controls [27] can be applied to remain in an upright posture
without noticeable sacriﬁce of IVBO. Half-body mapping ap-
proaches have either no direct mapping between players’ legs
and the limbs of an animal at all, or one leg is mapped to
multiple limbs, which allows us to control creatures like spi-
ders. Apart from fatigue, such controls are beneﬁcial for cases
where full-body tracking is not available.

To summarize, ﬁnding an optimal virtual creature is a mul-
tifaceted process, and we suggest the impact of additional
body parts and resulting superhuman skills, as well as possible
control approaches be considered during the decision-making.
To illustrate that process in more detail, we will showcase a
possible selection approach of avatars and game mechanics in
the next section.

solved in order to win/escape. We picked that setting for two
particular reasons. First, if virtual and real rooms match in size
and shape, locomotion can be achieved by natural walking,
which has a positive impact on presence [50, 26] and removes
the need for additional, artiﬁcial navigation techniques, such
as teleportation. Hence, players can focus more on the actual
animal experience and are less distracted by accompanying
functionalities. Second, escape room games are similar in
their concept, which allows us to implement multiple, yet com-
parable scenarios, i.e., different rooms with different animal
avatars. Each room contained two to three quests that involve
navigation and object manipulation. In contrast to common es-
cape games, we did not impose any time limitation to remove
competition as a factor from our studies.

After picking the overarching game type, we focused on the
design of the underlying game mechanics. We set ourselves
the objective of building the individual room quests around
distinct animal abilities. We selected three animals based their
superhuman skills and/or additional body parts: a rhino, a
scorpion, and a bird. In particular, our selection included
morphologies with different degrees of similarity compared
to our human body. A bird has a straightforward mapping,
i.e., our arms become wings, and our legs become bird’s feet.
The horn of the rhino has no direct counterpart and requires
a head-oriented interaction that is exotic for human beings.
Finally, the scorpion comes with additional limbs, a tail with a
sting, and two claws, which is the most differing morphology
with at least two nonhumanoid interactions.

Rhino Room
We chose a rhino mainly because of its horn and the related
capabilities. We suggest that such head-centered interactions
occur seldom in VR games and could offer a unique player
experience. In our case, players should use the horn (and
paws) to escape from a burning cage, as shown in Figure 3. In
particular, the horn was needed to move crates and clear the
area in front of a water tap, to remove the tap from the wall to
release a jet of water, and, ﬁnally, to lift and remove a lock bar
that kept the door closed.

Example Realization
To study animal avatars in a game context, we created a diverse
testbed that supports multiple creatures with Unity 3D [65].
The main idea is based on so-called escape rooms [70]: play-
ers are placed in a room ﬁlled with challenges that have to be

We utilized full-body controls with 1:1 motion mapping, i.e.,
players had to crawl on all fours during the game. Therefore,
we positioned additional trackers at the hip and both ankles
and wrists, i.e., no Vive controllers were used. We relied on
inverse kinematics (IK) [8] to reconstruct the player posture.

Figure 4. Scorpion Room. Players remained in an upright posture (left) and used the controllers to open and close the claws and initiate a tail strike.
To escape from the labyrinth, players had to cut away several branches (right). The exit-blocking emperor scorpion (middle) had to be pelted with
poisoned fruits. The avatar tail was used to pick up these fruits. Aiming during the throwing process was done via a proper hip orientation.

In particular, we applied a combination of closed-form and
iterative solvers to provide the required degrees of freedom
yet minimize jittering caused by unavoidable tracking errors.
The horn was always visible to the players and placed slightly
below the camera, as can be seen in Figure 3.

Scorpion Room
A scorpion offers even more unique interactions compared
with a rhino if we allow players to control its tail and claws. In
our scenario, depicted in in Figure 4, players had to use these
techniques to cut their way through a labyrinth and defeat a
giant enemy by throwing a poisoned fruit at it (cf. Figure 1).
The fruit had to be picked up and thrown via the sting at the
end of the scorpion tail.

To explore a variety of control approaches, we relied on half-
body tracking, i.e., an upright posture, instead of 1:1 mapping,
as done in the rhino game. We used the tracking data from
the HMD, two Vive controllers, and an additional tracker at
the hip position. Player arm movement was transferred to the
virtual claws via IK. Trigger buttons could be used to open
and close the claws to perform cutting. The circular track pad
button initiated a tail strike, whereas aiming was performed
by hip alignment. We did not track players’ legs. Hence, the
limbs of the scorpion were equipped with predeﬁned “walking”
animations matching the speed of player movement.

Bird Cage
To complete the diverse set of our virtual animals, we also
included a ﬂying creature, as can be seen in Figure 2. Being a
bird, players could use their virtual wings for two purposes:
ﬂying and creating gusts of wind to move objects. To escape
from their virtual cage, players had to gain altitude, reach the
highest point, and ﬂutter with their wings in sync with the
movement of a ceiling lamp, which then gained momentum
and broke the cage door. Gaining altitude required signiﬁcant
effort, and players had to rest on rods between their ﬂights.

We used the same tracking setup as in the rhino game, i.e.,
trackers at hip, wrists, and ankles. Players remained in an
upright posture, and their arms were mapped to the wings, i.e.,
ﬂapping was achieved via rapid up and down arm movements.
To create gusts, players moved their arms horizontally instead.
Flying around in the cage consisted of two components: ﬂap-
ping to gain altitude, and walking to perform a horizontal

transition. We explicitly enforced that horizontal physical
movement to minimize cybersickness [28] by reducing the
cognitive mismatch between physical and visual feedback. If
players stopped waving their arms mid-air, a “falling” proce-
dure was applied. That transition was performed rapidly to
prevent cybersickness [26].

EVALUATION

Research Questions and Hypotheses
The main purpose of our study was to investigate how players
experience the animal avatars in our three game scenarios
to draw conclusions about which aspects of representation,
control, and interaction are perceived positively or negatively.
Accordingly, our main research questions are:

1: Do animal avatars induce positive player experiences?

2: How do players evaluate the different design decisions
regarding posture, visible body parts, and control map-
ping in our three games?

We assume that slipping into the role of an animal is a
novel and interesting experience, and that the control of non-
humanoid body parts and the use of related special abilities can
raise players’ enjoyment and engagement. Our three different
realizations allow us to investigate whether a realistic posture
and locomotion technique (e.g., crawling), the visibility of
certain body parts, and the type of control mapping contribute
to or interfere with a positive experience.

Besides the general acceptance of animal avatars and the eval-
uation of the respective player experiences, we also consider
the concept of IVBO. Based on prior ﬁndings indicating that
IVBO is not limited to human-like bodies [74, 27], we hypoth-
esize that our virtual animal bodies are capable of inducing
IVBO as well, and that higher IVBO can be associated with
higher perceived presence and game enjoyment. Hence, we
want to test the following hypothesis:

H1: IVBO is positively correlated with game enjoyment

and perceived presence.

Study Procedure and Applied Measures
We applied a within-subjects design with the game scenario
as the independent variable with three levels (rhino, scorpion,

bird). After being informed about the study procedure and
signing an informed consent, participants ﬁlled in a ﬁrst ques-
tionnaire about their demographic data, gaming habits, and
prior experiences with VR headsets. We also administered the
Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire (ITQ) [72] to check par-
ticipants’ individual tendencies to get immersed in an activity
or ﬁction.

We then introduced the participants to the ﬁrst game scenario.
The three games were played in varying order to avoid biases
due to sequence effects. In particular, we counterbalanced
the sequence of the three game scenarios across subjects. All
sessions followed the same procedure. First, the examiner
explained the goal and controls of the game and applied the
VR headset, an HTC Vive Pro [10] with a wireless adapter,
and HTC Vive Trackers [11]. Subsequently, a neutral mirror
scene was started, in which participants saw their animal body
avatar and were able to get used to the controls by observing
their movements in a big mirror, as can be seen in Figure 5.
This scene was displayed for 2 minutes to enable embodiment.
The duration is a common choice for IVBO studies, and prior
work indicates that even 15 seconds are enough to cause that
effect [33]. After the mirror scene, we asked the participants to
remove the HMD and administered the acceptance and control
subscales of the alpha IVBO questionnaire [49]. We were
mainly interested in the IVBO experience while playing and
not in the subsequent effects on players’ bodily perception,
so the change dimension of the IVBO questionnaire was not
applied. We decided against performing threat tests for captur-
ing IVBO, because we expected signiﬁcant sequence effects.
Note there is no uniﬁed procedure for measuring IVBO, and a
threat test is not the only possibility [23, 49]. We decided to
use the alpha IVBO questionnaire and checked its reliability
by calculating Cronbach’s alpha for both subscales (all alphas
> 0.82).

Upon completion, we re-equipped the participants with the
HMD and launched the main game. Each gaming session
lasted about 7 to 10 minutes, depending on how quickly play-
ers were able to solve all riddles. After each session, we asked
the participants to ﬁll in a questionnaire asking about their
experiences during play. We administered the enjoyment sub-
scale of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) [51] to assess
general game enjoyment, as well as the Player Experience of
Need Satisfaction (PENS) questionnaire [52, 47, 19] to test
experienced autonomy, competence, and intuitiveness of con-
trols. We measured the feelings of presence by the Presence
Questionnaire [73, 71] and the Igroup Presence Questionnaire
(IPQ) [55, 54]. To test for negative physiological effects of
using the immersive HMD, we also administered the Simu-
lator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) [21]. Finally, we posed
some custom, game-speciﬁc questions to assess how players
evaluated the controls, the required posture during play, as
well as the visibility of certain body parts. We also asked
whether participants could imagine using this kind of avatar
control in other VR games. All administered questionnaire
items had to be rated on a unipolar scale ranging from 0 to 6
(“completely disagree” to “completely agree”), except from
the SSQ, which had to be rated on a unipolar 4-point scale.

Figure 5. Before each game, players were asked to act in front of a
wall-sized mirror for about two minutes to get familiar with their virtual
representation and to answer the alpha IVBO questionnaire [49].

Results
In total, 32 persons (19 female, 13 male) with a mean age
of 23.7 years (SD = 5.18) participated in our study. Due to
recruiting at a university, most of them were students (N = 25),
whereas the others were employees. Many participants re-
ported prior experiences with VR headsets (N = 22), but only
two of them used VR systems on a regular basis. All par-
ticipants were familiar with digital games and the majority
(N = 24) reported playing digital games regularly.

Players’ Experiences with the Three Animal Avatars
Following our research questions, we analyzed participants’
ratings of the different animal avatars and their experiences
in the three game scenarios. Mean values of all applied ques-
tionnaires can be found in Table 1. Considering the scales’
range from 0 to 6, almost all aspects were rated above average,
indicating a positive experience in all three game scenarios. In
particular, IMI scores and perceived presence as measured by
the PQ show that players enjoyed the games and felt as if they
were actually being and acting in the virtual world. Scores

Table 1. Mean scores and standard deviations of the IMI, PENS, PQ, IPQ, IVBO, and SSQ subscales for the three game scenarios (all scales range
from 0 to 6, except from SSQ, which ranges from 0 to 3). Signiﬁcant differences of mean values between conditions were tested by calculating repeated
measures ANOVA (F) or Friedman tests (χ 2), if data was not normally distributed.

of all three subscales of the SSQ—nausea, oculomotor, and
disorientation—were very low in all conditions (all M < 0.36),
and thus cybersickness was not an issue and can be excluded
as a potential confounding variable.

We compared players’ experiences in the three game scenarios
in terms of the subscales of IMI, PENS, PQ, IPQ, and IVBO to
investigate whether the different avatars and interactions were
perceived differently. Our analysis of covariance indicated no
signiﬁcant inﬂuence of immersive tendencies (ITQ) on our
dependent variables, hence we did not further elaborate on
that. In advance, we performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
to assess all scales for normal distribution as a requirement
for parametric calculations. If violated, results of Friedman
tests are reported instead of repeated measures ANOVA for
comparing the three game scenarios. Bonferroni correction
was applied for all post-hoc tests. The main test statistics can
be found in Table 1.

Regarding players’ need satisfaction (PENS), we found signif-
icant differences between the three game scenarios in terms of
autonomy and intuitive controls. Post-hoc tests indicate that
perceived autonomy was signiﬁcantly higher when playing
with the rhino compared to the scorpion scenario (p = .049).
The intuitiveness of controls was rated signiﬁcantly higher in
the rhino scenario than in both the scorpion (p = .012) and the
bird condition (p = .004).

Comparisons of the PQ subscales show further signiﬁcant
differences. According to post-hoc tests, participants reported
signiﬁcantly better experiences regarding the possibility to
act and the possibility to examine in the rhino scenario than
in the other two games (all p < .004). Moreover, the total
score for presence was signiﬁcantly higher for the rhino than
for the scorpion (p = .017). The interface quality, in contrast,
was rated signiﬁcantly lower in the scorpion game compared
to the bird scenario (p = .049). All other measures did not
differ signiﬁcantly, i.e., we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences
regarding general game enjoyment or IVBO.

Insights About the Different Postures
As our different scenarios required different postures, we asked
how the actual gaming posture was perceived and if partic-
ipants would have preferred another posture. For the bird
and scorpion avatars, participants agreed that the upright pos-
ture was comfortable (bird: M = 4.50, SD = 1.48; scorpion:
M = 5.03, SD = 1.26), whereas the kneeling posture in the
rhino condition was rated ambiguously and perceived as be-
ing physically demanding by several participants (M = 3.44,
SD = 1.98). However, when asked whether they would prefer
an upright playing posture to control the rhino, the majority of
players tended to disagree (M = 2.56, SD = 2.41). In contrast,
they agreed that the kneeling posture contributed to the realism
of the game (M = 4.16, SD = 1.99).

The bird posture and the mechanics of locomotion (ﬂapping
with the arms to move up combined with walking to move
horizontally) was also perceived as being realistic (M = 4.84,
SD = 1.08). Accordingly, participants did not wish for another
posture (M = 1.09, SD = 1.65).

Similar ratings were given for the scorpion: participants rated
the posture as being realistic (M = 4.13, SD = 1.95) and did
not wish for another posture such as kneeling (M = 1.78,
SD = 2.01), although a kneeling posture would be objectively
more realistic. When asked whether they had the feeling
of being stuck in the ground (due to the low head position),
participants were rather inconclusive (M = 3.25, SD = 2.17).
During the experiment, we observed that some participants
were indeed a bit irritated at the beginning, but got used to the
mismatch between their own and the avatar’s body size quite
quickly.

Controls
Overall, the high ratings for PENS’ intuitive controls conﬁrm
that participants had no problems moving and interacting in
the game world and using the animals’ abilities in all three sce-
narios. Although our three animal avatars are rather different
in terms of posture and control mapping, participants stated
in all three cases that they could very well imagine using this
kind of avatar control in other VR games (rhino: M = 4.56,

SD = 1.78; scorpion: M = 4.94, SD = 1.44; bird: M = 4.75,
SD = 1.55).

Visibility of Body Parts
Regarding the visibility of certain body parts, we were inter-
ested in players’ opinions about the usefulness of such visu-
alizations and the possible interferences. In the rhino game,
the horn was displayed in the players’ sight throughout the
game. However, the horn was neither perceived as being dis-
ruptive (M = 0.69, SD = 1.18) nor resulted in the perception
of a constrained ﬁeld of view (M = 0.97, SD = 1.26). In con-
trast, participants enjoyed using the horn as a tool (M = 4.78,
SD = 1.60).

In the bird cage scenario, apart from the wings, the bird’s
feet were also displayed. Participants appreciated this display,
because they rated this feature as being helpful for landing on
the rods (M = 5.22, SD = 1.49).

Special Abilities
We also asked players about their opinions regarding the spe-
cial abilities they could use as animals. Participants agreed that
the use of the horn of the rhino enriched the whole experience
(M = 4.91, SD = 1.33). The scorpion’s sting was rated as very
interesting (M = 4.44, SD = 1.59), and players also liked to
use the claws (M = 3.81, SD = 1.86). Moreover, players rated

the experience of ﬂying as a bird as very interesting (M = 5.12,
SD = 1.36) as they did the bird’s ability to create gusts of wind
(M = 4.19, SD = 1.93).

Correlations between IVBO, Enjoyment, and Presence
Mean values of IVBO control are rather high, and mean val-
ues of IVBO acceptance are above average, as well, which
indicates that players have experienced IVBO while control-
ling our animal avatars. To test our hypothesis regarding the
relation between IVBO and the player experience (H1), we
analyzed the correlations between the two subscales of the
IVBO questionnaire and the subscales of IMI, PQ, and IPQ.
We calculated Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcients (Spear-
manâ ˘A ´Zs rho) due to a lack of normal distribution of some
scales. Table 2 summarizes the results for each game scenario.

Overall, we found signiﬁcant positive correlations between
IVBO and nearly all PQ and IPQ subscales: ratings of experi-
enced realism, the possibility to act, the possibility to examine,
PQ total, and spatial presence are consistently signiﬁcantly
correlated with both IVBO dimensions in all three games. Fur-
thermore, IVBO control also signiﬁcantly correlates with the
perceived interface quality and the general feeling of presence
as measured by the IPQ. IVBO acceptance correlates with the
interface quality except from the scorpion scenario, and with
general presence except from the rhino scenario. The only
scale not signiﬁcantly correlated with IVBO in any scenario is
IPQ involvement.

Regarding game enjoyment, our analysis shows signiﬁcant
positive correlations between IVBO control and IMI enjoy-
ment scores in all three scenarios. The correlation between
IVBO acceptance and enjoyment is signiﬁcant in the bird
cage and the scorpion room, whereas there is no correlation
in the rhino condition. In sum, our results mainly support our
hypothesis H1.

Discussion and Design Implications
Our results indicate that animal avatars in VR games can
induce positive player experiences. We implemented three
games with animal avatars that are very different regarding
body features and abilities, and in all cases players reported
high enjoyment and high presence, i.e., the feeling of actually
being in the virtual world and being the rhino, scorpion, or
bird. Participants particularly appreciated the novel body ex-
periences and nonhumanoid perspectives, as well as the use of
the special animal abilities.

Special abilities
The feedback of participants on our three games shows that
players are very interested in performing actions that they are
not able to perform in real life. For instance, they were fasci-
nated by the ability to ﬂy upwards using their wings as a bird,
and they enjoyed testing how they could manipulate objects
with their rhino horn. We reason that such superhuman abil-
ities signiﬁcantly contribute to players’ enjoyment and their
motivation to play. Hence, the main game mechanics of games
featuring animal avatars should foster the animal’s speciﬁc
characteristics and abilities to create novel, fanciful experi-
ences. Designers should take advantage of players’ curiosity
and expose unique animal features.

Player Posture and Controls
In all three games, the adopted postures were perceived posi-
tively and without an explicit desire for alternatives. In other
words, there is no indication that a realistic yet uncomfortable
posture (rhino) is better or worse than a convenient and upright
but unrealistic posture (scorpion). However, the statements
regarding crawling on the ﬂoor as a rhino were quite ambiva-
lent, i.e., some of the participants enjoyed such an experience,
whereas others became rapidly exhausted by that activity. Note
that the rhino, however, outperformed other animals in cer-
tain subscales, such as autonomy (PENS), intuitive controls
(PENS), and the possibility to act (PQ). Hence, a 1:1 mapping
where players have to behave exactly like they would expect
from their animal avatar is easier to grasp and is perceived as
very realistic.

Similarly, our results did not disqualify or favor any particular
control approach – all three controls were rated as very intu-
itive and participants could imagine using such approaches
in other VR games. Hence, we suggest controls be designed
based on the game-related animal abilities and the target
audience. For instance, we assume that children are more
willing to spend their time crawling on the ﬂoor compared to
elderly adults. In general, transferring as many player move-
ments as possible onto the avatar is a reasonable approach,
especially considering the positive inﬂuence on IVBO [53].
However, as we have seen in the scorpion case, less straight-
forward mappings can be equally engaging and fun without
enforcing an uncomfortable posture. Furthermore, such imple-
mentations can be achieved with less tracking equipment.

Visible body parts
Game designers have different approaches regarding the visi-
bility of the avatar’s body in ﬁrst-person mode. From our expe-
rience, we would not recommend visualizing the whole body,
as the avatar head position often leads to confusing viewports
when players look down on them. Instead, we suggest the
visualization be limited to body parts that can be directly
controlled by the player, e.g., claws, tails, wings, and horns.
In particular, the additional body parts, although reducing the
visible area, are not perceived as disturbing. For instance,
participants rated the horn as a helpful tool and reported that
the bird’s feet facilitate the landing on thin rods. Furthermore,
seeing animal body parts like claws moving in sync with our
own body increases our awareness of embodiment.

Morphology
Considering the morphology of our three animal avatars, our
results indicate that players had no problems with controlling
bodies that are not similar to the human shape. Even the con-
trol of the scorpion, which has several additional limbs, claws,
and a tail, was perceived as intuitive and did not cause any con-
fusion. In contrast, we observed that players particularly liked
additional body parts such as the scorpion’s sting or the horn
of the rhino. Hence, we challenge game designers to consider
extraordinary animal shapes and derive innovative game
mechanics. We should not back off from adopting complex
body compositions as long as they are associated with inter-
esting possibilities for interaction design. In our three games,
we always focused on the outstanding bodily features of the

animals and linked them to certain player abilities (e.g., create
gusts of wind) to give signiﬁcance to them. We suggest that
additional or missing body parts compared to the human body
should enrich players’ opportunities to examine and interact
with the virtual world and not appear as an impairment. This
way, we can foster players’ experience of having superhuman
capabilities.

IVBO
Finally, we conclude that additional body parts or a nonhuman
body shape do not inhibit an avatar’s potential to induce IVBO.
Our three exemplary animal avatars illustrate that IVBO is
not limited to body models that are similar to the human
body. With regard to our hypothesis H1, our results reveal that
IVBO—which was measured prior to the gaming sessions and
is, thus, not biased by the subsequent game experience—is
positively correlated with game enjoyment and perceived pres-
ence. This ﬁnding indicates that IVBO may contribute to a
positive player experience. Hence, we conclude that IVBO
is a considerable factor when designing nonhumanoid VR
avatars. To foster IVBO in a game, we suggest that game
designers provide players with possibilities to see their vir-
tual body (e.g., in mirrors or water reﬂections) to increase
awareness of their virtual representation.

LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
Our derived design implications are based especially on the
three evaluated scenarios. Hence, we need to consider a set of
associated limitations to prevent possible misinterpretation of
the ﬁndings. In the ﬁrst place, our main goal was to expose a
complete pipeline of embedding animal avatars into VR games.
We aimed to raise the awareness regarding the wide variety
of decisions (e.g., posture, animal type, mapping/controls,
special abilities, morphologies, locomotion) that have to be
considered during such a game development process. As a
result, our evaluated scenarios are rather complex games with
a number of possibly inﬂuential variables that might limit the
generalizability. For instance, the general appeal of an animal,
e.g., a dangerous scorpion vs. a domestic bird, might impact
our game enjoyment. Well-known species, such as a rhino,
might be more intuitive to control than exotic creatures with
abilities unknown to us. And although we removed artiﬁcial
VR navigation techniques (e.g., teleportation) by matching the
size of the virtual environment to the physical room, the differ-
ent locomotion (ﬂying vs. crouching vs. walking) could still
have a considerable impact on the player experience. Finally,
although all three scenarios were escape games, the particular
quests could have inﬂuenced the outcome. In other words,
we emphasize that the direct comparison of the three study
conditions should be interpreted with these limitations in mind
and that the reason behind our variety of scenarios was not
the comparison per se, but our strive to cover as much of the
animal avatar design space as possible to create a comprehen-
sive starting point for future explorations. Also, comparative
studies in the future would beneﬁt from an additional control
group with a human avatar for a better assessment of the ani-
malsâ ˘A ´Z inﬂuence on IVBO and game enjoyment compared
to a rather traditional virtual representation.

Another important limitation to be mentioned is that we did
not involve animal/domain experts during the design phase and
pretests of our study. Our decision making regaring the choice
of animal avatars and, even more important, their abilities and
interactions, was made without the input of an expert. The lat-
ter could have provided additional input regarding the realistic
behavior of animals and our perception of such species.

As a next step, we suggest to focus on particular avatar compo-
nents in a more targeted study to build a theoretical framework
that provides an isolated in-depth exploration of major factors,
such as locomotion, altered or additional body parts, and ap-
peal. We suggest that such isolated insights should be gathered
as a second step after seeing the â ˘AIJwhole pictureâ ˘A˙I, i.e.,
how such animals work or do not work in games. For instance,
prior work [27] reported that embodying a tiger while crawling
on all fours was disliked by the participants, whereas a rhino,
being a very similar mammal, provided the highest enjoyment
in our scenario. Hence, we suppose that it is not just the fa-
miliarity with an animal or the intuitive locomotion, but rather
subtle details, e.g., the additional horn, that can signiﬁcantly
alter our experience of such avatars and, thus, need further
research.

For further studies, we also recommend expanding the age
range of the participants. In our case, most participants were
students due to the acquisition at the university, which limits
the applicability of our ﬁndings. Instead, it is likely that as-
pects such as the necessary physical effort or the perceived
avatar appeal are experienced differently by other age groups.
Consequently, the age of the target audience might be an im-
portant design consideration and should be explored in future
work.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Our work investigated the hidden potential of animal avatars.
We focused on virtual reality games because of the related
IVBO effect that allows us to embody our avatar and perceive
certain player interactions in a more intensive way. Accord-
ingly, our studies supported our general assumption that games
created around animal avatars could lead to great enjoyment.
In particular, players liked the interactions resulting from addi-
tional body parts, such as wings and horns. In this regard, we
proposed different ways to control animals with such differing
morphologies and discussed related design implications for
animal-centered VR games.

As a particular ﬁnding, we reported a correlation among IVBO,
presence, and game enjoyment. Since our studies had a dif-
ferent emphasis, i.e., the general usefulness of animal avatars,
we cannot disentangle these relations in detail. However, we
see our results as evidence for the importance of IVBO for VR
games in general, be it human or animal avatars. Hence, we
propose an in-depth investigation of that overarching topic as
possible follow-up research. Ultimately, we assume that a fur-
ther exploration will encourage researchers and practitioners
to consider IVBO as a helpful tool that allows the creation of
novel, engaging player experiences that cannot be realized in
non-VR games.
