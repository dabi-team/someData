Cameras a Million Miles Apart: Stereoscopic Imaging Potential
with the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes

Joel D. Green1,2, Johannes Burge3, John A. Stansberry1, & Bonnie Meinke1

ABSTRACT

The two most powerful optical/IR telescopes in history – NASA’s Hubble
and James Webb Space Telescopes – will be in space at the same time. We have
a unique opportunity to leverage the 1.5 million kilometer separation between
the two telescopic nodal points to obtain simultaneously captured stereoscopic
images of asteroids, comets, moons and planets in our Solar System. Given the
recent resurgence in stereo-3D movies and the recent emergence of VR-enabled
mobile devices, these stereoscopic images provide a unique opportunity to engage
the public with unprecedented views of various Solar System objects. Here,
we present the technical requirements for acquiring stereoscopic images of Solar
System objects, given the constraints of the telescopic equipment and the orbits
of the target objects, and we present a handful of examples.

1.

Introduction

When encountering astronomical imagery, the public can be signiﬁcantly disconnected
from the visualizations adopted by scientists. The experience of seeing Saturn and its ring
system with a simple “backyard” telescope is thrilling for many viewers. But typical tele-
scopic images lack binocular depth cues because each image is captured from a single viewing
position. It is possible to achieve stereo views of a Solar System object with astronomical
parallax (waiting 0.5 yr between images), but this does not allow for simultaneous imaging
of a non-sidereal or transient event. One way to achieve a vivid impression of depth is to
image target objects stereoscopically.

Stereopsis is the perception of depth from binocular disparity. Binocular disparities are
the small, subtle diﬀerences between the two eyes’ images due to the eyes’ diﬀerent vantage

points on a 3D scene. Binocular disparity is the most precise depth cue available to the
human visual system. Under optimal conditions, the human visual system is capable of
detecting binocular disparities as small as 5 arcsec (Blakemore 1970; Cormack et al. 1991;
Burge & Geisler 2014), approximately 1/6 the width of an individual foveal photoreceptor
(Curcio et al. 1990). Given a typical human interocular distance (65mm), this disparity
detection threshold means that a human observer can reliably detect depth diﬀerences as
small as ∼ 1/3 mm at a distance of 1m. The binocular disparity associated with a given
depth diﬀerence decreases approximately with the square of the distance, and increases
linearly with the physical separation between the imaging devices (e.g. eyes). Thus, the
larger the physical separation between the imaging devices, the greater the potential for
resolving small depth diﬀerences.

Space telescopes have the potential to achieve enormous physical separations. In the
next several years, the two highest resolution space telescopes in history–the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) and the soon-to-be-launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)–will be
in space simultaneously. The physical separation between these telescopes will average 1.5
million kilometers, with a range from 1.3 to 1.7 million kilometers; and the spatial resolution
of each telescope in the optical/near-infrared is ∼ 0.07 arcsec1. The physical separation
between the telescopes will be large enough, given the spatial resolution of the telescopes,
to yield detectable binocular disparities even for very distant targets in our Solar System.
In particular, we show that the space telescopes will provide unprecedented opportunities to
image the planet Mars, the moons of Jupiter, the rings of Saturn, and other Solar System
objects of interest in stereo 3D.

The HST and JWST missions will overlap signiﬁcantly: NASA has approved HST for
continued operations through at least 20212, and JWST is projected to launch in October
2018, beginning science operations in mid-20193. Thus we anticipate a ∼ 2 yr period of
overlap in science missions.

HST and JWST both include imaging capability between 0.7 and 1.6 µm, in several
broad and narrow channels, via Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and the Advanced Camera
for Surveys (ACS) for HST, and the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) for JWST. Although
JWST has a larger aperture, NIRCam is not diﬀraction limited at these wavelengths. How-
ever, JWST will achieve comparable or better angular resolution than HST over this range.
For the purposes of this work, we adopt the limiting spatial resolution of the pair as that of

1With a 6.5m aperture, JWST is not diﬀraction limited at wavelengths < 2 µm.

2. Technical Requirements

2.1. Binocular Disparity

Binocular disparity is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the angles subtended by the

lines of sight to two diﬀerent targets:

δ = θ1 − θ2

(1)

where θ1 and θ2 are the angles subtended by the lines of sight to target points 1 and 2 (Fig.
1). Disparity is equivalently deﬁned by the diﬀerence between the angles subtended by the
two targets in each eye:

δ = αR − αL
where αL and αR are the visual angles subtended by the two targets in the left and the
right eyes, respectively. These angles must be resolvable (given the spatial resolution of the
sensor) for disparities to be detectable.

(2)

To obtain an expression for disparity in terms of distance and depth, we substitute using

basic trigonometry:

δ = 2[tan−1(

I
2(d2 + ∆)

) − tan−1(

I
2d2

)]

(3)

where ∆ = d1 − d2 is the depth (i.e. distance diﬀerence) between one target 1 and target
2, d1 is the distance to one target, d2 is the distance to the other target, and I is the
physical separation between the imaging devices (“eyes”) (Figure 1). Under the small angle
approximation, the equation simpliﬁes to:

δ =

−I∆
d2
2 + ∆d2

(4)

Human disparity detection thresholds are ∼ 1/6 the width of a foveal photoreceptor;
foveal photoreceptors subtend approximately 30 arcsec of visual angle. For stereo-astro-
photographs to contain detectable disparity signals, the disparities should be at least 1/6
the pixel pitch of the telescopic sensors. The best spatial resolution is 0.07 arcsec for
HST/WFC3-UVIS 4, and 0.065 arcsec (PSF FWHM) for JWST/NIRCam5, where full spa-

tially sampled (> 2 µm). In the IR, HST/WFC3-IR is limited to 0.13 arcsec6. If the HST
pixel pitch is adopted as the limiting resolution, the minimum detectable disparity will be
0.012 arcsec. Of course, disparities larger than the minimum will produce more compelling
eﬀects.

2.2. Limiting Resolution

We consider bands in the electromagnetic spectrum between 0.7 µm and 1.6 µm for
the purposes of this work. HST is a 2.4m primary mirror telescope. For the following cases
we assume a separation between HST and JWST of 1.5 × 106 km, although this distance
will vary ∼ 10% every few months due to the planned orbit of JWST ∼ 105 km around the
second Lagrange point (L2).

3. Case Studies for Stereoscopic 3D in our Solar System

The disparity and limits for various case studies are shown in Figure 3 and discussed in

the following sections.

3.1. Case Study: A Living Mars Globe

Mars (d ∼ 5.5 × 107 km) has a radius of 3000km. With a 1.5 million km imaging
baseline, when Mars is closest to Earth, the nearest and farthest viewable points on the
surface of Mars will yield a disparity of 0.3 arcsec, a large superthreshold disparity given the
spatial resolution of the telescopes. The farthest point on Mars’ orbit is approximately 5×
farther from Earth than the near point in its orbit. At the far point, the nearest and farthest
viewable points on the surface of Mars will yield a disparity of only 0.02 arcsec disparity.
This dramatic 25× change in the magnitude of the disparity signal is due to the fact that
disparity decreases with the square of the distance to the target (Eq. 4). Thus, close to
opposition, it is feasible to obtain a stereo-image of Mars, and the spherical 3D shape of
Mars will be captured in resolvable stereo 3D.

The optimal case is slightly less optimistic than above. First, JWST cannot observe
Mars fully at opposition and keep the sunshield oriented properly. In 2020, Mars is about 0.6

– 5 –

AU (9×107 km) from JWST when at its closest approach during a visibility window. Second,
with NIRCam, saturation can be an issue. Saturation can be avoided by using narrow-band
(1%) ﬁlters, the shortest being at 1.64 µm, but a shorter wavelength ﬁlter cannot be used
to take a full-disk image. However, it might be possible to do a mosaic using a very small
subarray to get an unsaturated full-disk image at 1.4 µm. In practice, it may not be possible
to image under the optimal conditions described above, but it will remain possible to obtain
stereoscopic images of Mars with signiﬁcantly super threshold disparities.

3.2. Case Study: Jupiter, Atmosphere, and its Moons

Jupiter’s enormous size (i.e. 140,000 km diameter) and striking atmosphere make it
another good candidate for stereoscopic 3D imaging. Jupiter’s moon system provides an
additional opportunity, with an interesting historic tie-in. The Galilean satellites (Io, Europa,
Callisto, and Ganymede) were ﬁrst observed by Galileo in 1610. Galileo was able to infer
the rotation of the moons by noting their change in position from night to night. The
three-dimensional orbits of the Galilean satellites around Jupiter would be showcased by
stereoscopic imagery. The moons are at distances ranging from 420,000 km to 1,880,000 km
from Jupiter (d = 600 million to 1 billion km; average 800 million km). At Jupiter’s average
800 million km distance, these moons will yield disparities with respect to the surface that
range from 0.2 arcsec to 0.9 arcsec. At the nearest point in Jupiter’s orbit, the nearest and
farthest viewable points on Jupiter’s “surface” will yield 0.06 arcsec of disparity.

3.3. Case Study: Saturn Ring System

Saturn (d ∼ 1.3 × 109 km) is surrounded by ice particles organized in a ring ranging from
70,000 to 200,000 km from the planet, with a height of ∼ 3 km, varying by ring (Figure 2).
Additionally, Saturn’s rings occasionally show disruption on rapid timescales7 (Meinke et al.
2012). To image Saturn’s rings in stereoscopic 3D, the disparity of the 70,000 km rings and
the 200,000 km rings from the surface of Saturn. At 70,000 km, the rings have 0.01 arcsec of
disparity (just below our detection threshold), and at 200,000 km the rings have 0.04 arcsec
of disparity. Thus, stereo photography of Saturns rings may be right at the edge of possible.

quality of the image when fused). Simultaneous capture eliminates these perceptual artifacts.

4. Additional Cases

We note a few additional cases where stereoscopic capabilities can be explored.

• Near Earth Asteroid motion. Although unresolved, the 3D eﬀect can be seen in

the asteroid’s tumbling path.

• Active comet/asteroid. Several comets have been observed by HST while on their
closest approach; combining this track with JWST could produce an intriguing 3D
sequence.

• Great Red Spot or other cloud features. It may be possible to discern or monitor

topography of cloud tops or other atmospheric features on Jupiter’s surface.

• Cometary collision/disruption/bending waves/size distribution in Saturn’s
F ring. Changes in Saturn’s rings due to structural or disruptive events may produce
wave eﬀects (Esposito et al. 2008; Murray et al. 2014).

5. Additional Considerations

5.1. Dependence on Telescope Separation

The 3D eﬀect is signiﬁcantly stronger when the telescopes are maximally separated, and
the targets are as close as possible. This is a particularly important factor in the proposed
Mars observations.

5.2. Combined Optical and IR Stereoscopic Imaging

We can achieve this stereoscopic imaging in the regime between 0.7 and 1.6 µm, which
includes a signiﬁcant number of near-IR bands, with respectively lower resolution and de-
tectable disparity at longer wavelengths. Given the large change in the appearance of all
three targets across this range, it may be interesting to try the eﬀect with multiple bands
together. This would produce a 3D image that could be viewed in multiple wavelengths,
which could be layered to reveal relative motions and depths.

– 9 –

6. Conclusions

When combined, NASA’s Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes are capable of a
unique observation: true stereoscopic 3D imaging, in the optical/near-IR overlap regime.
Separated by 1.5 million kilometers, we can produce 3D images of asteroids, comets, moons
and planets in our Solar System, for a variety of astronomical applications. We have out-
lined the basic constraints, along with a sampling of case studies. We anticipate several
opportunities during an anticipated 2 yr mission overlap.

The authors would like to thank Dr. Jennifer Wiseman, for discussions in which the

original idea germinated.
