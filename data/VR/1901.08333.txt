Abstract Based on the data of spectral monitoring of the yellow hypergiant V509 Cas performed
in 1996–2018 at the 6-m telescope with the spectral resolution of R≥60 000, we studied in detail its
kinematic state at various levels of extended atmosphere. No signs of presence of a companion were
found. An agreement of radial velocities measured on the permitted and forbidden emissions of
metal ions, as well as their strict temporal stability led us to the choice of the systemic velocity of the
star Vsys=−63 km/s. The position of forbidden [NII] emissions forming in the circumstellar medium
is strictly stable and is systematically shifted by −6 km/s relative to the metal ion emissions. A
conclusion on the variation of the [NII] emission halfwidths and intensities (the lines have become
narrower and more intense) is made after the observations in 1996 and these parameters did not
vary over the next 22 years of observations. The velocities measured from the shortwave FeII(42)
absorption components are located in a narrow interval of Vr=−(84÷87) km/s, which indicates
the stability of expansion of the upper layers of the atmosphere. The overall atmosphere of the
hypergiant is stable, excluding the layers close to the photosphere. The velocity variability in range
of Vr=−(52÷71) km/s, identiﬁed by the positions of strong metal ion absorption cores, may be a
manifestation of pulsations in deep atmospheric layers, where this type of lines are formed.

1. Introduction

A yellow hypergiant V509 Cas is a prominent representative of a group of rare stars near the luminosity
limit. The general data about these objects with the initial masses of 20÷40M⊙ are represented
in [1, 2]. In addition to their extreme luminosity, yellow hypergiants diﬀer from ordinary supergiants
by a very high mass-loss rate in the stellar wind and the presence of gas and dust circumstellar
envelope. Hypergiant instability is manifested as a weak brightness variability (with an amplitude
of ≈ 0.2 ÷ 0.4m), which is usually referred to as the pulsation type. Along with the manifestations
of instability, yellow hypergiants also experience sporadic pulsations, the so-called “shell episodes”,
during which the star is particularly intensively losing its mass and for several hundreds of days gets
enveloped by the ejected cold matter forming a pseudophotosphere.

Yellow hypergiants occupy a limited area on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram [3]. However, observ-
able properties of well-studied representatives of this family (ρ Cas, V509 Cas, V1302 Aql) signiﬁcantly
diﬀer. This has to do primarily with the diﬀerences in the optical spectra and the features of the struc-
ture and kinematics of the envelopes. For example, in the spectrum of the yellow hypergiant ρ Cas,
which is considered as a prototype of a group of yellow hypergiants, a signiﬁcant variability of the
emission-absorption proﬁle Hα, as well as the splitting of the BaII, SrII, TiII and other strongest
absorptions with a low excitation potential of the lower level was discovered more than half a century
ago by Bidelman and McKellar [4]. Later, these features of the ρ Cas spectrum were studied in detail

by spectral monitoring [5–9]. On the HR diagram ρ Cas is located at the boundary of the Yellow
Void [2], separating the hypergiants and LBVs in the quiet phase. On the boundary of the Yellow
Void, the amplitude of pulsations of yellow hypergiants apparently sharply increases, what leads to
an increased instability of the atmosphere and a blowing oﬀ of the envelope [2]. In 2013, the ρ Cas
system underwent a new mass ejection, at which the stars brightness dropped by 0.5m. This ejection
occurred only 12 years after the previous one in 2000–2001. This way, there is an increase in ejections
in ρ Cas, which, according to Aret et al. [10] may suggest an approach of the star to the boundary of
the Yellow Void. Surprisingly, with such a vigorous mass loss, an optical spectrum so rich in features
and variability, this hypergiant does not have a circumstellar dust envelope.

A close relative of ρ Cas, a yellow hypergiant V1302 Aql, is on the contrary associated with one of the
brightest sources of IR-radiation IRC+10420. In the system of this object a source of maser radiation
in OH was also detected [11]. The optical spectrum of V1302 Aql is dominated by the emission and
absorption lines of metal ions FeII, TiII, ScII, CrII, emission lines FeI and absorption lines NI, OI
and SiII, as well as the forbidden lines [FeII], [CaII] and [OI] [12–15]. Metal ion line proﬁles are very
diverse: from almost symmetrical emissions to the reverse P Cyg-type proﬁles and absorption proﬁles
with two emission components. A long-term spectral monitoring of V1302 Aql, performed during the
past decades [12, 14, 15], led to the conclusion that the object had passed on the HR-diagram the
path from the red supergiant to the cold border of the Yellow Void.

The diﬃculty of studying the spectra of yellow hypergiants is well-illustrated by the history of the
study of the cool supergiant HD 179821, identiﬁed with an IR source IRAS 19114+0002. A combination
of the observed parameters of this star for a long time did not allow to unambiguously determine
its evolutionary status (see the paper [16] and references therein). However, over the past years,
strong enough evidence for the belonging of the star to yellow hypergiants was obtained [17, 18]. The
supergiant V509 Cas, like V1302 Aql, described a complex path, a “zigzag” on the HR-diagram, as
expressed in [3]. In the optical wavelength range the spectrum of this hypergiant varied at diﬀerent
points of observation in the range of spectral classes G–K, while preserving the Ia luminosity class [19].
The optical spectrum of V509 Cas is rich in emission features that distort the absorption proﬁles not
only of hydrogen, but also of metallic lines, which in one way or another is inherent in the spectra
of other studied yellow hypergiants. At the same time, the spectrum of V509 Cas revealed a unique
feature–emissions of highly excited forbidden lines of [NII] 6548 and 6584 ˚A already found in the
spectrum of this star in 1961 [20], when this star was considered as an MK-classiﬁcation standard.
Their presence in the spectrum of such a cool single star is diﬃcult to explain. This fact served as an
incentive for us to conduct a long-term monitoring of the star with high spectral resolution.

In this paper, we present the results obtained based on the monitoring of the spectrum of the star over
several sets in 1996–2018. Section 2 brieﬂy describes the methods of observations and data analysis.
In Section 3 we present the results, compare them with the ones previously published. Section 4 gives
the conclusions.

2. Observations, reduction and analysis of spectra

We have carried out all observations of V509 Cas with the echelle spectrographs in the Nasmyth focus of
the 6-m BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the RAS. The dates of observations
and registered spectral ranges are given in Table 1. In 1996 we used the Lynx echelle spectrograph [21],
which in combination with the CCD chip 1K×1K provided the spectral resolution of R≈25 000. All
subsequent spectral data were obtained with the NES echelle spectrograph [22, 23], equipped with
a large format CCD sized 2048×4608 pixels. To reduce light loss without a deterioration of spectral
resolution, the NES spectrograph is equipped with an image slicer (which provides three slices of a
stellar image). Every spectral order on the image is repeated three times with an oﬀset along the
dispersion of an echelle grating [23]. A transition to the large format CCD substantially extended the
boundaries of the simultaneously recorded wavelength interval: for example, ∆λ=5400÷8479 ˚A in the

spectrum of 1.10.2014 or ∆λ=4697÷7782 ˚A in the spectra of 2017. Spectral resolution is λ/∆λ ≥60 000,
the signal-to-noise ratio is S/N>100 and diﬀers little from one spectrum to another.

Extraction of one-dimensional data from the twodimensional echelle spectra was performed using
an ECHELLE context from the MIDAS software package modiﬁed taking into account the features of
the echelle frames of the spectrographs used (see the features in [24]). The removal of traces of cosmic
particles was carried out by the median averaging of two spectra, obtained sequentially one after the
other. The wavelength calibration was performed based on the spectra of a Th–Ar hollow-cathode
lamp. We identiﬁed the features in the spectrum of V509 Cas using the previously published spectral
atlas [25]. All further reduction, including the photometric and positional measurements was done
using the latest version of the DECH20t code [26]. Note that this spectrum reduction program we
traditionally use allows to measure radial velocities for individual features of line proﬁles, and that the
paper only uses the heliocentric velocities Vr. Systematic errors in measuring Vr, estimated by sharp
interstellar components of NaI do not exceed 0.25 km/s (from one line), a random error for shallow
absorptions of about 0.7 km/s – the average value per line. Thereby for our averaged values in Table 1
random errors are about 0.3 km/s.

3. Discussion of results

3.1. Main features of the optical spectrum of V509 Cas

V509 Cas is a very attractive object for a detailed high-resolution spectroscopy: this bright star has co-
ordinates, permitting year-round observations in the northern hemisphere, and its spectrum is abound
in a variety of complex features, which can be clearly seen in Figs. 1÷3. Naturally, such an interesting
object has a long history of spectral observations, and the main features of its spectrum were found in
the earliest publications [20]. Since 1974, its spectral class has become earlier: in 1977 it was classiﬁed
as F8 (the same as in ρ Cas [19]). According to our observations, from 1996 to 2018 the spectrum of
V509 Cas varied little, and the spectral class remained even earlier, close to F2. We made this estimate
visually from a comparison of the spectrum of V509 Cas with the data from the spectral atlas of F-
and G-stars [25] and quantitatively from the FeI and FeII line intensity ratio. Figure 4 shows the
evolution of the stellar spectrum with time on its small fragment with the FeI and FeII lines. Two
upper fragments are borrowed from the above work [19]. This ﬁgure indicates the absence of signiﬁcant
changes of spectral class in V509 Cas during our observations over 1996–2018, which is consistent with
the constancy of the eﬀective temperature of the star during these years (see Fig. 2 in [3]).

As noted in the Introduction, in terms of its eﬀective temperature and its evolutionary status
V509 Cas is close to a related object V1302 Aql. The optical spectrum of the hypergiant V1302 Aql is

dominated by the emission and absorption lines of FeII, TiII, ScII, CrII metal ions, FeI emission lines
and NI, OI and SiII absorptions [14, 27]. Some emission features are identiﬁed with the forbidden lines
of [FeII], [CaII] and [OI]. The metal ion line proﬁles are very diverse: from the almost symmetrical
emissions to the reverse P Cyg-like proﬁles and absorption proﬁles with two emission components.
The high excitation lines (NI, OI and SiII) have almost symmetrical absorption proﬁles, shifted on
the average by 5 km/s red-wave relative to the positions of minima of their proﬁles. The spectra of
V509 Cas reveal roughly the same set of metal lines, but the FeI lines are more often purely absorption,
or absorption with emissions in the wings.

The hydrogen Hα and Hβ lines in the spectra of V1302 Aql have a characteristic two-peak proﬁle,
similar to the Hα proﬁle in the spectrum of V509 Cas. But compared to the spectrum of V509 Cas,
the ratio of emission peaks in the spectrum of V1302 Aql is the opposite: the short-wave peak is
much more intense than the long-wave peak. Only on one of the dates (11/24/2007) of many years of
monitoring of V1302 Aql the 6-m telescope recorded an unusual view of the Hα proﬁle, in which the
longwave peak substantially exceeds the shortwave one. In addition, unlike V509 Cas, in the spectrum
of V1302 Aql a broad photospheric absorption is completely ﬂooded with the emission. For a more
detailed comparison of the spectra of two hypergiants it is convenient to use the atlas of the V1302 Aql
spectrum [28].

All our spectra of V509 Cas contain the Hα line, some of its proﬁles are presented in Fig. 3, from
which stems an insigniﬁcant proﬁle variability over the whole period of 1996–2018. The intensity of
the shortwave emission peak is constantly below the longwave one. Mainly the shortwave absorption
wing is exposed to the wind-induced variability. There are no noticeably signiﬁcant changes either
in the shapes of metal line proﬁles or in the positions of their main components. This is shown in

the FeII 7462 ˚A line, as well as Table 1.

V509 Cas is usually considered to be a spectral twin of the hypergiant ρ Cas [29], and therefore many
authors compare their spectra [5, 29÷31]. However, a detailed study of the spectra of both hypergiants
with close fundamental parameters (mass, luminosity, evolutional stage) revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences
both in the spectra and kinematic conditions of their atmospheres, indicating diﬀerences in physical
processes causing an instability of the atmospheres and envelopes. Spectral diﬀerences are manifested
primarily in the diﬀerences of the Hα proﬁle and its variability.

The Hα proﬁle in the spectrum of ρ Cas signiﬁcantly varies mainly due to the envelope ejections.
The Hα proﬁle variations are especially demonstrative after the 2013 ejection [9]. The shifts of the
Hα proﬁle indicate a change in structure and increased instability of the upper layers of the extended
atmosphere of the star. A signiﬁcant shift of the proﬁle to the long-wavelength region in the spectra
of August–September 2017 indicates the infall of the layers of matter where the line is formed.

As follows from Fig. 3, the behavior of Hα proﬁle in the spectrum of V509 Cas is according to our
observations more calm. The Hα absorption components in this ﬁgure and FeII (42) lines in Fig. 2
are located on both sides of the Vsys line, which indicates the presence in the atmosphere and in the
envelope of V509 Cas of both the outﬂowing and accreting matter. The proﬁle variations are observed
in the shift and variable width of the absorption component (Fig. 3) caused by unstable conditions in

the envelope, expanding at a velocity of 33÷40 km/s. Note that the authors of [30], comparing the
spectra of V509 Cas and ρ Cas in the near UV, have also emphasized that these two stars are not
spectral twins.

In addition, a temporarily variable splitting of the strongest absorptions and envelope emissions
of the iron group atoms is observed in the spectrum of ρ Cas (see [9] and the references therein).
Both of these eﬀects due to the presence of a powerful structured envelope in ρ Cas, are absent in the
spectrum of V509 Cas. On the other hand, the spectrum of V509 Cas possesses the features missing
in the spectrum of ρ Cas: the highly excited forbidden lines [NII] and emission components in most
of the permitted and forbidden metal ion lines (see article [20] and Fig. 1 and 4 in this publication).
A number of diﬀuse interstellar features are identiﬁed in the spectrum of V509 Cas, while they are
absent in the spectrum of ρ Cas, which has close galactic coordinates.

The spectrum of V509 Cas has a similarity with the spectrum of a hotter high-luminosity star 3 Pup
(Sp = A4 Iabe). In the spectrum of this massive supergiant, studied in detail in [32], a bifurcated Hα
line was registered with a stronger red component (a P Cyg III-type proﬁle according to Beals [33]),
the emissions of forbidden [OI] 1F 6300, 6364 ˚A lines, the doublet [CaII] 1F 7291, 7324 ˚A and emissions
in some Fe II lines. The authors of [32] stressed that in the spectrum of 3 Pup only the MgII 4481 ˚A
line can be considered photospheric, and in FeII lines a contribution of the envelope is obvious, which
gives the proﬁles a speciﬁc shape: the wings are raised by the emissions. The same type of features
we also observe in the spectrum of V509 Cas, in which the wings of even the weak lines are distorted
by the emissions, which is clearly seen in Fig. 2 for the FeII 7462 ˚A line with a depth of not more
than 0.2 from the level of the local continuum. The star 3 Pup is the coldest member of the family of
supergiants with the B[e] phenomenon, discussed in detail in the paper of Aret et al. [34].

3.2. Forbidden lines of [NII]

The presence of various emission combinations [OI], [OII], [NII], [SII], [CaII], etc. is not a sign of any
certain class of stars. Strong forbidden emissions whose region of formation is a dense rotating disk [34]
are ordinary features in the spectra of stars with the B[e] phenomenon. An example of this class of
stars are the well known star CI Cam and above-mentioned 3 Pup, in the spectrum of which there are
many forbidden emissions, but the [NII] emissions are absent. The presence of forbidden emissions is
known in other types of hot, far evolved stars that have passed stages with a substantial loss of matter:
a hypergiant MWC 314 [28], an LBV-star GR-290 [35], an X-ray transient [36, 37], a protoplanetary
nebulae that entered the envelope ionization phase [38–42]. The objects with forbidden emissions of
light metals and their ions are often binary systems with a hot component [43].

It is also well known that the optical spectra of classical symbiotic and symbiotic nova stars as a
rule contain forbidden emissions. An example could be a cool peculiar supergiant PU Vul [45, 46].
Symbiotic stars are binary systems with a hot companion, UV radiation of which provides ionization
of the gas envelope of the system and formation of the emission spectrum [47]. However, for the
spectrum of a single cold star V509 Cas the presence of [NII] emissions are more diﬃcult to explain.
The likely mechanisms of excitation of these emissions in the spectrum of V509 Cas are discussed
in many publications since the discovery of these features. Sargent [20] notes that the presence of
forbidden [NII] emissions and complex emission-absorption Hα and Hβ proﬁles indicate the probable
existence around V509 Cas of a hot envelope. In the article [48], devoted to the study of the chemical
composition of the atmosphere of V509 Cas, Luck adheres to the same position. However, Lambert et
al. [5] do not ﬁnd this version with a hot companion attractive, calling it only a passive spectator of the
cataclysms of the primary star. As long ago as in 1978 Lambert and Luck [19] suggested several versions
on the mechanism of excitation of forbidden [NII] lines in the spectrum of V509 Cas: dissipation of
mechanical energy, ionization due to the UV radiation of hot stars of an HII-region in the volume
of the Cep OB1 association etc. Obviously, the principal in solving this problem is the spectrum of
V509 Cas in the UV range. As the authors of [30] showed, the UV spectrum of this star does not
contain any features and fully meets the expectations given the main parameters of this object.

A peculiar behavior of [NII] emissions is observed in the spectrum of the cold peculiar supergiant
R CrB. In a state of a deep brightness minimum, when the star is almost completely closed, optimal
conditions arise for the registration of a nebular spectrum of the envelope [49]. An important moment
is a long duration of the glare of the envelope in the [NII] emissions: as noted by the authors of [50],
at low density, the nebula can remain ionized for up to 104 years.

In the spectrum of V509 Cas, the half-width of the [NII] lines varies: δVr = 50 km/s in September
1961 [20], 30 km/s in 1967 [44]. The half widths for three lines [NII] 5755, 6548 and 6583 ˚A are
measured from our spectra, presented in Table 2. It is necessary to emphasize here that the half
widths measured in our spectra by ﬁve times exceed the half-width of the spectrographs point spread
function. A reduction of the emission half-widths in the spectra of V509 Cas occurred after the 1996
observations and persisted over the next 22 years of our observations. The intensities of the [NII]
lines also vary with time: in 1967 the equivalent widths Wλ of the 6583 and 6548 ˚A lines were 0.13
and 0.045 ˚A respectively [44], which is consistent with the theoretical intensity ratio 3:1 according
to Osterbrock [51]. According to our observations the behavior of line half-widths with time was
accompanied by a synchronous change in their intensities: in 1996 the equivalent widths increased
by approximately 1.7 times, then the intensity stabilized. Note that in the spectrum of the star the
intensity measurements were carried out relative to the level of the local continuous spectrum, so that
at the constant emission rate in lines, their variability is also possible due to the varying brightness
of a star. According to the AAVSO database, V509 Cas experiences a slight brightness decrease in
the past decade. Since the half-width also varies, it means that the velocity dispersion changes in an
optically thin envelope, i.e. the envelope is non-stationary.

3.3. Radial velocity pattern

We have fully identiﬁed the features in the spectrum of V509 Cas. However, their huge number does
not allow us to give here a complete list of identiﬁed lines. Table 3 contains only those spectral features,
the positions of which are measured to study the velocity ﬁeld. Expecting to ﬁnd a probable velocity
ﬁeld stratiﬁcation in the extended atmosphere of the hypergiant, we conducted a subsequent analysis
of radial velocity measurements, by combining the related spectral features into several groups. Group
averages are presented in Table 1, where the dates of spectrum acquisition are indicated (in 1996 using
the Lynx spectrograph, further – using the NES spectrograph), the working spectral intervals and
heliocentric radial velocities Vr, averaged for the spectral features of diﬀerent nature and rounded to
whole km/s.

The third column of Table 1 lists the averaged velocities for the forbidden [FeII] emissions (10–13
features in the spectra with diﬀerent wavelength ranges), while the fourth column gives them for the
permitted metal ion emissions. The subsequent columns for the features of other types:

– such as the paired elevations above the continuous spectrum on the absorption wings (see the
FeII 7462 ˚A proﬁle in Fig. 2) (over two hundred absorptions of SiII, ScII, TiII, CrII, FeII, YII, BaII).
The listed values are given for the emissions in general, the central parts of which are superimposed
by absorptions. The measurements are made from the lower parts of their proﬁles;

– for the upper parts of the proﬁles (wings) (ﬁfth column) and FeI weak absorption cores (10–12

lines), CaI (four lines) – the sixth column;

– for the cores of the components of the three strong FeII absorptions of the 42-nd multiplet in

column (7) (as an example, Fig. 2 shows the line proﬁle of this multiplet FeII 5169 ˚A);

– for the absorption components (in column (8)) of the Hα proﬁle presented in Fig. 3;

– for three forbidden [NII] emissions 5755, 6548 and 6584 ˚A in column (9);

– for the four components of the NaI (1) proﬁles in columns (10)–(13). Figure 5 presents the NaI 5896 ˚A

proﬁle, averaged over the 2017 spectra;

– for a sample of diﬀuse interstellar DIB bands with the wavelengths λ: 5705, 5780, 5797, 5849, 6196,

the last 6203, 6284, 6379, 6613, 6660, 6672 ˚A – in the last column.

Owing to the high quality of the spectra and a long-term monitoring, we have obtained reliable
conclusions in our study regarding the temporal behavior of the velocity ﬁeld in the atmosphere
of V509 Cas, which follow from the data in Table 1. The proximity of the values presented in the
ﬁrst three columns, and their constancy in time indicate that the systemic velocity of V509 Cas is
close to Vsys=−63 km/s. Exactly this value is described by a vertical broken line in Figs. 2 and 3.
Note that the accepted value of the systemic velocity Vsys=−63 km/s is not so far from the average
velocity for the Cep OB1 association Vr=−58.2 km/s [52], a member of which is also the hypergiant
V509 Cas. Variations of velocity measured from the forbidden lines (3-d column of Table 1) are minimal
over time: Vr=−(62÷63) km/s. The velocity variability for the cores of FeII (42) absorptions is also
minimal: Vr=−(84÷87) km/s, what testiﬁes to the stability of the upper atmosphere. Note a similar
behavior in time of the positions of forbidden emissions and FeII (42) core absorptions in the spectrum
of the above-mentioned supergiant 3 Pup [32].

As follows from Table 1 (column 6), velocity variability is the most prominent by the posi-
tions of strong absorption cores of the iron group ions: their range from these absorptions is
Vr=−(52÷71) km/s. This variability, which is well-illustrated by a panel with an NI 7468 proﬁle in
Fig. 2, in the case of a single star can be a manifestation of pulsations in the deep atmospheric layers,
where the formation of this type of lines takes place. A pulsation variability of radial velocity in highly
excited lines of neutral nitrogen NI with a full amplitude of about 19 km/s coinciding with our result
was previously found by Sheﬀer and Lambert [29]. They found probable variability periods of 421 and
315 days, noting a constant, incessant proﬁle instability. Recall that this type of pulsation variabil-
ity with an amplitude of about 10 km/s measured from the weak and moderate-intensity symmetric
absorptions is also inherent in the hypergiant ρ Cas [9].

As follows from the data of Table 1, forbidden [NII] emissions in the spectrum of V509 Cas are
systematically shifted relative to the [FeII] emissions. However, this shift is stable, since for all
times of our observations, the position of the [NII] emission remains in a small interval of velocities:
Vr(NIIf)=−(68÷69) km/s. A temporal constancy of this velocity is noted by Lambert et al. [5], taking
the mean value of Vr(NIIf)=−72 km/s for systemic velocity. Additional justiﬁcation for this choice of
systemic velocity follows from the agreement of Vr(NIIf) with a velocity measured from the emissions

of a CO molecule, forming at the most outer layers of the extended atmosphere of the hypergiant:
Vr(CO)=−(72÷76) km/s [5]. Later, the conclusion about the constancy of the radial velocity measured
from the forbidden emissions of [NII] in the optical spectra obtained during the long-term monitoring
was also done by Sheﬀer and Lambert: Vr(NIIf)=−72 km/s [29] and Vr(NIIf)=−69 km/s [53].

A remnant of ejection of stellar matter located at a distance from the star can be considered a
possible source of radiation of forbidden [NII] emissions. Earlier, de Jager [54] proposed such an
explanation for the occurrence of forbidden [NII] emissions in spectrum of V509 Cas, indicating the
formation of these emissions in the envelope, the kinetic temperature in which is higher than the
temperature of the star. One has to keep in mind that the atmosphere of the star, and hence the
matter ejected in the circumstellar neighborhood are largely enriched with nitrogen, because in the
atmosphere of V509 Cas the nitrogen excess is over +3.5 dex [48]. Apparently, the so much altered
chemical composition of the atmosphere explains the lack of expected emissions of oxygen ions, the
relative abundance of which in the atmosphere of the star is at least two orders of magnitude lower
than that of nitrogen [48].

3.4. Multicomponent proﬁle of NaI D-lines

Multicomponent proﬁles of NaI D-lines (see Table 1 and Fig. 5a), in addition to the component near
the systemic velocity, also contain a narrow absorption with Vr≈ −50 km/s and the poorly resolved in
our spectra saturated components in the velocity range of Vr≈ −20; −30 km/s. A narrow absorption
of Vr≈ −50 km/s is formed in the interstellar medium and corresponds to the position of V509 Cas
farther away than the Perseus Arm [55, 56]. The positions of the circumstellar components in Fig. 5,
where the NaI D-line proﬁles in the spectra of V509 Cas and ρ Cas are compared [9], having close

 
 
Klochkova et al.: Extended atmosphere of V509 Cas hypergiant in 1996–2018

11

galactic coordinates, are in a good agreement. An interstellar feature of Vr=−13 km/s is registered
in the spectrum of the variable V354 Lac [57], the galactic coordinates of which are close to those for
V509 Cas and ρ Cas.

The structure of interstellar lines in the spectrum of V509 Cas agrees well with its great remoteness,
as well as with its extremely high luminosity, Mv≈ −9m. We obtained the luminosity estimate based
on the equivalent width Wλ(OI 7774)=2.35 ˚A of the triplet OI 7774 ˚A in the spectrum of the star using
the calibrations from [14, 58]. For comparison note that in the spectrum of the hypergiant V1302 Aql
with its extreme luminosity near the Humphreys–Davidson limit [59, 60], the equivalent width of the
oxygen triplet has a maximum value of Wλ(OI 7774)= 2.8 ˚A [14].

The position of the NaI component with the velocity Vr=−62; −63 km/s in Fig. 5 is close to the emis-
sions and absorption wings, which indicates the formation of this component in the stellar atmosphere.
The position of the most shortwave depression in the NaI D line proﬁles coincides with the shortwave
component of the FeII (42) proﬁles: −89 km/s in Fig. 2. This agreement indicates the formation of
the most shortwave component in the outermost layers of the atmosphere close to the circumstellar
envelope. A broad long-wave component of the NaI D-lines in the velocity range of Vr≈ −20; −30 km/s
includes several unresolvable (at R=60 000) interstellar features. The position of one of them coincides
with the reliably measured in the spectrum of V509 Cas position of diﬀuse interstellar bands (DIBs):
of about −14 km/s.

The KI 7699 ˚A proﬁle features, also presented in Fig. 5, mostly correspond to those of the NaI D-
lines. However, interstellar bands of Vr≈ −14 and −23 km/s, formed in the Local Arm are better
identiﬁed in this proﬁle. All these features of the interstellar and circumstellar origin are discernible
in the core of the Ca II 3968 ˚A line in Fig. 5b.

4. Conclusions

Based on the data of spectral monitoring of the yellow hypergiant V509 Cas, performed over 1996–
2018 at the 6-m telescope with spectral resolution R≥60 000, its kinematic state at various levels of
extended atmosphere was studied in detail. The proximity of velocities based on the permitted and
forbidden emissions of metal ions, as well as their strict constancy in time led to the choice of systemic
velocity of the hypergiant: Vsys=−63 km/s.

No signs of binarity of the star were detected.
For all our observations sets, the position of forbidden [NII] emissions, forming in the circumstellar
medium, corresponds to the velocity Vr(NIIf)=−(68÷69) km/s. Therefore, [NII] emissions are system-
atically shifted by −6 km/s relative to the metal ion emissions. We made a conclusion that after the
1996 the variation of half widths and [NII] emission intensities (the lines have become narrower and
more intense) and over the next 22 years of observations, these parameters did not vary.

The velocities determined using the cores of wind absorptions FeII (42) are constant within the
interval of Vr=−(84÷87) km/s, which indicates the stability of the uppermost layers of the atmosphere.
In general, we concluded on the stability of the hypergiants atmosphere excluding the layers closest to
the photosphere. The velocity variability in range of Vr=−(52÷71) km/s, determined by the positions
of the cores of strong absorptions of the metal group ions may be a manifestation of pulsations in the
deep atmospheric layers, where this type of lines is formed.
