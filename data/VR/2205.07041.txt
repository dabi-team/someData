Abstract—Virtual reality head-mounted displays (VR HMDs)
have become a popular platform for gaming. However, simulator
sickness (SS) is still an impediment to VR’s wider adoption, par-
ticularly in gaming. It can induce strong discomfort and impair
players’ immersion, performance, and enjoyment. Researchers
have explored techniques to mitigate SS. While these techniques
have been shown to help lessen SS, they may not be applicable
to games because they cannot be easily integrated into various
types of games without impacting gameplay,
immersion, and
performance. In this research, we introduce a new SS mitigation
technique, VRCockpit. VRCockpit is a visual technique that
surrounds the player with four 2D views, one for each cardinal
direction, that show 2D copies of the areas of the 3D environment
around the player. To study its effectiveness, we conducted two
different experiments, one with a car racing game, followed by
a ﬁrst-person shooter game. Our results show that VRCockpit
has the potential to mitigate SS and still allows players to have
the same level of immersion and gameplay performance.

I. INTRODUCTION

Virtual reality (VR) has gained mainstream acceptance with
the mass commercialization of VR head-mounted displays
(HMDs). VR provides users highly immersive experiences,
which can make games more attractive and enjoyable. As
such, gaming has becomes one of its main uses. Despite its
positive affordances, the adoption of VR games still faces
some challenges. In the saturated market of games,
is
important to grab the players’ attention and retain it from the
initial times they try and play the game(s) [1]. This is where
VR does not do so well because playing VR games often
causes discomforts from simulator sickness (SS), which can
happen within the ﬁrst interactions [2], [3]. SS can lead to an
unpleasant experience and a negative perception of VR [4].

it

To help VR users reduce their SS symptoms, various tech-
niques have been proposed and studied [5]–[14]. Mitigation
techniques have been shown to be effective in many non-
gaming scenarios, but in games they often show inconsistent

or even negative results (e.g., [15], [16]). Games are complex
and visually rich environments and players are required to
do frequent (and often rapid) changes of viewpoints (e.g.,
racing and ﬁrst-person shooter games [6], [12], [16]–[20]).
It is challenging to design techniques that are effective in
reducing SS and, at the same time, maintaining a suitable
level of immersion and gameplay as good as without such
techniques. For example, Teleport has been reported to be
efﬁcient in SS reduction, but it makes navigation discrete,
which is not suitable for action-based games where continuity

 
 
 
 
 
 
of scenes is crucial [17], [21]. Similarly, using rest frames
requires adding additional ﬁxed visual elements to the VE
for players to look at continuously. This approach could be
limiting, as the player should avoid looking away from these
visual elements but should have their visual focus on them
frequently. Other common techniques are based on blurring
parts of the display [6], [15], [16] or reducing its ﬁeld-of-view
[9], [16] and, as such, would likely block away certain parts of
the VE, making them inaccessible or invisible to players. Other
researchers have explored providing ﬁrst- vs. third-perspective
views [22]–[24]. Some results indicate that third-person VR is
less likely to make people have SS compared with ﬁrst-person,
but the former is not perceived as immersive. In addition,
some games, like ﬁrst-person shooters, are more enjoyable and
natural when played in ﬁrst-person view.

This research presents a new visual mitigation technique,
VRCockpit, for VR games that, as our results show, allows
players to have the same level of immersion and performance.
VRCockpit surrounds the players with four 2D views, one for
each cardinal direction, that show 2D copies of the areas of the
3D environment behind them (see Fig. 1). It does not impose
a non-natural way of navigation, add any additional ﬁxed
frames, or block parts of the VE from players’ view. We ran a
user experiment with a car racing game and a second follow-
up experiment with a ﬁrst-person shooter game. In the two
experiments, we measured players’ performance, immersion,
and usability against their SS levels. Our results show that
VRCockpit is a simple yet viable, cost-efﬁcient, and effective
technique for SS mitigation in VR racing types of games.

In this paper, we make the following two contributions: (1)
VRCockpit, a new SS mitigation technique for VR games;
(2) two user studies with two different game contexts and
their analysis of VRCockpit’s effect on immersion, gameplay,
and performance. Our ﬁndings suggest that VRCockpit can
be applied to different types of games, can maintain the same
level of immersion (compared to not using it), and can lead
to the same level of gameplay performance.

This paper is organized as follows: we ﬁrst

introduce
our theoretical background and related literature on existing
techniques, how they inﬂuenced our research, and some of
their relevant ﬁndings. We then introduce VRCockpit and its
design rationale, followed by two studies. We then present a
discussion about the results and possible directions for future
work. The paper ends with a conclusion.

II. RELATED WORK

A. Simulator Sickness in VR Games

Simulator sickness (SS) refers to side effects that can occur
during or after experiencing VR [3], [25]. It is common but
has not been fully understood so far [26]. Two of the most
widely accepted theories that can potentially explain SS are:
the sensory conﬂict [27], [28] and the postural instability [29],
[30]. The former attributes SS to a conﬂict between sensory
systems. Speciﬁcally, the mismatch between visual inputs and
people’s vestibular system perception is the main inducement
of SS. The postural instability theory posits that a person’s

inadaptability to the long-term postural instability leads to SS.
In addition, the rest frame hypothesis [31], [32] states that
ﬁxed environmental items can be used as references in the
human brain for viewing the world. Accordingly, researchers
have attempted to use ﬁxed gazing points or other visual
objects to reduce SS [8], [13].

B. Mitigation Techniques in Games

Since SS is always a negative factor hindering the adoption
of VR games by users, mitigation techniques have been pro-
posed. Locomotion is a very common and necessary activity
for moving in a 3D VE and is considered one of the most
signiﬁcant interaction components of VR experiences [33].
However, locomotion is also related to the severity of SS
because it can elicit either sensory conﬂict or postural insta-
bility [34], [35]. Accordingly, Teleport has been developed to
mitigate SS during locomotion and is now frequently deployed
in VR applications [5]. It allows players to jump to dis-
crete destinations without experiencing continuous transitional
movement. Discrete navigation jumps are meant to minimize
sensory conﬂicts and, as such, are thought to be helpful in
alleviating SS symptoms. Even if Teleport has shown to be
effective and has been applied in some commercial games
(i.e., Robo Recall1), prior research also indicates that it is
detrimental to completing VR tasks due to disorientation [10],
[36], [37]. Furthermore, the technique does not allow continu-
ous movement, and therefore may not be quite appropriate in
other game contexts such as car racing, sports, or even ﬁrst-
person shooter games [17].

There are other types of visual techniques based on the rest
frame hypothesis, which tend to add information to VE. Gaze
Point [13] is one example, which offers users a central ﬁxed
rest frame. As such, users can focus on the reference point to
help mitigate SS. Similarly, Clarke et al. [8] reported that a
target reticule in the center of the screen alleviated dizziness
and some SS symptoms. Other types of rest frame techniques
have been tested in previous studies to varying degrees of
success. Cao et al. [7] introduced a black see-through mental
net as the stationary reference. Their results showed that the
net can help reduce SS levels, especially discomfort. Besides,
a virtual nose embedded in the middle bottom part of the
view has been tested in [38]–[40], and has been shown to
have potential in mitigating SS because it provides a consistent
sense of stability.

Other visual techniques aim to reduce SS by lessening the
visual information that users perceive. For instance, viewpoint
snapping [18] and rotation blurring [6] intentionally reduce
visual information the user can receive during rotational move-
ment in VR environments. As such, the illusion of self-motion
is also reduced. Likewise, research has found that ﬁeld of
view (FoV) reduction can alleviate SS [9], [11], [14], [41].
By limiting the display’s FoV, the feeling of self-motion may
be reduced, which, according to the sensory conﬂict theory,
can assist prevent sensory conﬂicts and therefore mitigate SS

[42]. Also, dynamic FoV modiﬁcation [14] has been proposed
to improve issues of lower presence, enjoyment, and user
performance. However, such techniques lead to information
loss and hence to lower performance in games [16].

III. VRCOCKPIT

VRCockpit (CP for short) is implemented using render
texture in Unity3D, a popular game engine that supports VR
devices. CP is composed of four 2D frames, one for each of
the cardinal directions around the user (i.e., front, back, left,
and right; see Fig. 1). Each frame displays a copy of the area
of the 3D VE behind the frame. They are ﬁxed and cannot be
rotated and zoomed in. The borders in the ﬁgures in this paper
are used to highlight the positions of frames, but they were not
shown in the game to avoid separating the 2D views from the
3D VE or adding extra visual elements to it. In each direction,
the 2D frame occupies nearly 30% of users’ FoV and all of
them are of the same size. This was found to be the ideal size
by participants in pilot studies, as users can still see the 3D
VE around them between the frames and, at the same, allow
the frames to display the main content of interest within them.
Fig. 1b and c show how CP looks in an actual gaming scenario.
The four frames are stationary in their positions relative to the
user, but their content is updated based on the changes in the
areas behind them. As such, it would not change the navigation
process. Also, unlike existing techniques that blur or block out
part of the screen, CP would not lead to information loss in
games but can help reduce SS by transferring 3D content into
2D views.

We also explored other design possibilities, like making the
frames move in synchronicity with the user’s head. However,
feedback from our pilot studies’ participants showed that this
was unsuitable because they would lose the sense of ‘3Dness’
of the environment and could be somewhat disorientating
when experiencing frequent changes. Their suggestion was
to keep the frames ﬁxed because they could make rapid eye
movements (or head movements) to see through the gaps
between the frames and the upper and lower areas not covered
by the frames, which was helpful in increasing their immersion
in the environment. In addition, ﬁxing the frames’ location in
relation to the user allowed consistency of views, which has
been found to be useful in reducing SS symptoms [7], [9],
[12].

To evaluate the effects of VRCockpit in reducing SS and
players’ performance in a fast-paced gaming context, we
conducted an experiment with a car racing game as the testbed
environment. A second follow-up experiment with another
game (a ﬁrst-person shooter) shows that the technique can be
applied to other types of games with similar results (described
in Section VII).

A. Game Environment

This was an in-house developed VR ﬁrst perspective car
racing game, consisting of turns and steep slopes for players to
traverse through (see Fig. 2a). In addition, there were barriers
along the way that players needed to avoid and coins to collect,
as shown in Fig. 2a. Any uncollected coin would disappear and
after the players completed a lap, all coins would be refreshed.
Players were required to ﬁnish two laps within the same game
condition. The car speed was set in the range of 0-70 km/hour
(or its equivalent in Unity units). Players were not allowed to
stop the car halfway unless they crashed onto barriers. The
racetrack does not have any branches. Thus, the players would
basically follow the same path. Fig. 2b demonstrates how
VRCockpit was implemented in the game. Because the virtual
car’s body may be an additional rest frame for participants,
which would be an undesired confounding factor, the virtual
car’s body was made invisible (see Fig. 2c).

B. Evaluation Metrics

After each condition (CP and Normal), two questionnaires
were given to the participants. First, a Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire (SSQ) [43] was adapted to measure the sickness
level in terms of different symptoms. Each symptom was rated
using a 5-point Likert Scale, with 0 as the least severe and
4 as the most severe. The ratings for each symptom were
further grouped into four sub-scores: Nausea, Oculomotor,
Disorientation, and Total. Second, an Immersive Experience
Questionnaire (IEQ) [44] with the same rating scale as SSQ
was used to elicit participants’ perceived immersion in the VR
game.

In addition, user performance was determined based on
objective measurements. During the experiments, we recorded
the total
the number of car crashes
(Crashes), and coins collected (Coins) to reﬂect user perfor-
mance.

time used (Time),

C. Participants and Apparatus

We recruited 18 participants (3 females, 15 males) whose
ages ranged from 18 to 22 (M = 19.63, s.d. = 1.50) from a
local university. All the participants reported that they had nor-
mal or corrected-to-normal vision and had no history of colour
blindness or health issues. Thirteen participants (72.22%) had
some experience with VR systems. Two participants (11.11%)
reported that they felt sick playing PC car racing games.

The virtual environment was rendered via an HTC VIVE
Cosmos in this experiment. The VR HMD was connected to a
desktop with 16GB RAM, an Intel Core i7-9700k CPU @
3.60GHz, a GeForce GTX 2080Ti dedicated GPU. Oculus
handheld controllers were used to control the movement of
the virtual car.

IV. EXPERIMENT

D. Experimental Procedure

We compared VRCockpit (CP) with the normal version
(Normal) of the game with no technique applied to it. The
experiment followed a within-subjects design. All participants
played both versions of the car racing game.

To eliminate the post-exposure effects of VR sickness, we
conducted a two-session experiment where participants only
played one version of the game in each session, resting
for at least one day. The order of the game version was

counterbalanced with a Latin square design to minimize the
carry-over effects. At the beginning of the ﬁrst session, we
asked participants to complete a pre-experiment questionnaire
to collect demographics and previous gaming experience infor-
mation, followed by an introduction to the rules and controls
of the game. Participants then played the ﬁrst version of the
game, and after this, they were asked to complete the two
aforementioned questionnaires based on their experience in the
game. The second session was conducted at least 24 hours later
to give participants enough rest. Participants played the second
version of the game and completed the same questionnaires.

E. Hypotheses

This experiment aims to verify the following hypotheses:
• H1. Participants will have lower SS in CP than Normal.
• H2. Participants’ perceived immersion will not differ

signiﬁcantly between CP and Normal.

• H3. Participants’ game performance will not differ sig-

niﬁcantly between CP and Normal.

V. RESULTS

We report results of inferential statistics with the support of
data visualizations. A Shapiro-Wilk test was ﬁrst conducted to
check the normality of the data. For normally distributed data
(p > .05), we conducted dependent t-tests. We used Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests for the data that was not normally distributed.
Spearman’s correlation test was used to examine relationships.

A. SSQ

Fig. 3 shows a summary of the results of the SSQ data. All
the four sub-scales were not normally distributed, as identiﬁed
by a Shapiro-Wilk test. After conducting Wilcoxon tests, we
found Nausea was signiﬁcantly lower in CP (M dn = 1.5)
than in Normal (M dn = 6.5, Z = −2.103, p = .035).
Disorientation was also signiﬁcantly lower in CP (M dn = 0.5)
than in Normal (M dn = 4.0, Z = −2.196, p = .028).
However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in Oculomotor
(Z = −.449, p = .653) and Total (Z = −1.658, p = .097).

B. Subjective Immersion

The descriptive analysis of participants’ perceived immer-
sion is summarized in Table. I. Wilcoxon test did not re-
veal a signiﬁcant difference between two conditions (Z =

−.711, p = .477). Spearman’s correlation test did not reveal
any signiﬁcant relationships between immersion level and
reported SS in two conditions (p > 0.5 for all cases).

C. User Performance

Table. I summarizes the results for Coins, Time, and
Crashes. According to the results of normality test, only Coins
was normally distributed. Dependent t-tests did not reveal
signiﬁcant difference in Coins (t(17) = −1.042, p = .312). In
addition, Wilcoxon tests showed no signiﬁcant difference in
Crashes (Z = −1.481, p = .138) and Time (Z = −.022, p =
.983).

We performed Spearman’s correlation test to investigate
the relationships between participants’ user performance and
reported SS, and between user performance and perceived
immersion. No signiﬁcant correlations were identiﬁed in the

VI. DISCUSSION

The results show that VRCockpit led to signiﬁcantly lower
symptoms in Nausea and Disorientation for all participants
than without it, indicating that the technique helped typical
players feel lower SS in the car racing game. This ﬁnding
conﬁrms our hypothesis H1. Moreover, most participants felt
either better or indifferent to the technique and most of the
participants who felt better had considerable improvements.
These participants were the ones who scored the highest when
not using any form of mitigation technique (i.e., in the Normal
condition).

There was no signiﬁcant difference in participants’ per-
ceived immersion. In addition, there was no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in user performance in terms of total time used, the
number of car crashes, and coins collected in our racing
game. These results indicate that VRCockpit would be less
likely to affect immersion and users’ gameplay negatively.
As such, Hypotheses H2 and H3 are both conﬁrmed. Based
on participants’ feedback, VRCockpit worked well in the car
racing game because it served as car windows and was closer
to real driving situations. A natural combination between the
technique and the virtual environment and scenario appears to
be helpful for how users perceive the technique.

Interestingly, we found that

the number of crashes and
reported SS symptoms were negatively correlated in the car
racing game where no SS mitigation technique was applied.
During gameplay, participants drove at similar speeds and
were not required to make any stops, except when crashing
onto the barriers. When participants drove smoothly,
the
surroundings changed rapidly, which led to the accumulation
of discomfort. While such accumulation was interrupted when
a crash happened. Participants had a short rest (usually a few
seconds) and this helped alleviate some symptoms. However,
these negative correlations were not found when VRCockpit
was used in the game. The main reason was that the technique
had reduced the SS symptoms, so the effects of crashes were
not signiﬁcant.

In summary, the results from our experiment suggest that
VRCockpit
in a car racing game not only had an effect
on mitigating SS but did not affect user performance and
immersion—this is a positive indication for VRCockpit’s use

in gaming environments that require continuous movement.
The car racing game can be a typical game involving virtual
navigation. In other words, players are mainly focusing on
in the VEs during the gameplay. To
the motion control
validate the usefulness of VRCockpit
in a more complex
game scenario, we ran a follow-up experiment using a First-
Person Shooting (FPS) game. An FPS game is generally more
dynamic compared to a car racing game, because it involves
weapon-based ﬁghting in addition to virtual navigation. Thus,
we used an FPS game as an additional testbed and proof-of-
concept of VRCockpit.

VII. FOLLOW-UP EXPERIMENT

This follow-up experiment sought

to further investigate
whether VRCockpit can help players reduce the Simula-
tor Sickness symptoms without affecting their performance
and immersion in a more complex and dynamic VR game
scenario—an FPS game.

A. Experimental Setup

The FPS game was built based on the FPS Microgame
Template2 from Unity Learn. Players needed to navigate
quickly and defeat all the enemy robots in the VE while
avoiding getting hit by them to ﬁnish the game. Fig. 4a and b

show how VRCockpit was implemented in the FPS game. The
game environment was made up of towering grey walls with
no additional visual clues to help with path memory, while
there were no confusing or hidden pathways. Furthermore,
the maximum ammo of the gun was 5 and it would reload
once depleted. This mechanic was designed to motivate players
to move frequently and balance shooting and hiding. The
adversaries were same-sized robots (see Fig. 4c), which would
follow and attack the players once the players were within their
range of detection. Each robot could withstand up to 14 bullet
shots from the players.

The experimental design and procedure were similar as
in the ﬁrst experiment. Speciﬁcally, participants needed to
complete a two-session experiment with a normal version of
the game (Normal) and a version that incorporated VRCockpit
(CP). We used the same SSQ and IEQ for measuring the
sickness and immersion level. For participants’ performance,
we recorded the total
in the
game (Time), total distance travelled (Distance), and total hits
received from robot enemies (Shots Received). We used the
same analysis methods and approach as the ﬁrst experiment.

time that participants spent

We recruited 10 participants (6 females, 4 males) in the
follow-up experiment. They were aged between 19 to 28
(M = 21.20, s.d. = 2.48). They all had a normal or
normal-to-corrected vision. None of them had any history of
colour blindness or other health issues. Seven participants had
some experience playing or interacting with VR HMDs. Six
reported that they felt discomfort when playing FPS games in
a traditional desktop monitor in the past. An Oculus Rift S VR
HMD was used to display the virtual environment. Participants
used mouse and keyboard to control their movements and
shooting behaviors as they lead to better performance in VR
FPS games [46].

B. Results and Discussion

Table. II summarizes all the results of this second exper-
iment. As shown in the table, Nausea, Disorientation, and
Total were signiﬁcantly lower in CP than in Normal. No other
signiﬁcant differences were found. These results were in line
with our results in the ﬁrst experiment. Given that we had a
lower number of participants in the follow-up experiment, we
could only provisionally conclude that VRCockpit can also
help to mitigate SS symptoms in a VR FPS game without
lowering players’ immersion and gameplay. However,
the
follow-up experiment and the results we observed can still be
regarded as a proof-of-concept providing further evidence that
the technique can be potentially applied to different types of
VR games with various difﬁculty levels and requiring different
types of navigation strategies.

Out of our expectations, although the FPS game is more
complex and dynamic compared to the car racing game,
participants generally gave lower ratings of the SS symptoms
in the FPS game (which can be reﬂected in the results shown
in Fig. 3 and Table. II). One possible reason is that, unlike the
car racing game, players needed to show more awareness of
all sides around them and react quickly if an enemy showed
up. In addition, players may be able to stop, move at different
speeds in the FPS game, and could ﬁnd some chances to hide
somewhere and wait for reloading, which provided users with
some breaks.

Few participants felt it was somewhat unusual and abrupt
to have a set of 2D frames surrounding them. One way that
the technique could be better integrated into the FPS is to tell
participants that they are wearing a virtual helmet with see-
through displays. This may help improve their perception of
the technique. As mentioned before, the combination between
the technique and the virtual environment and scenario should
be natural to improve the game experience.

VIII. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Because of different design elements between experiments
(e.g., time, controller), we were unable to conduct a between-
subjects analysis to explore if game types could inﬂuence the
technique’s effectiveness. These choices were by design and
guided by prior research. For example, we opted for the typical
dual-hand controller for the VR racing game to be in line
with other studies (e.g., [16], [45]). On the other hand, we
used a mouse and keyboard in the FPS game, because [12]
observed advantages in using the mouse and keyboard over a
dual hand-based controller in a VR FPS game. Also, it is often
the case that time and distance are within a similar range for
all participants in car racing games, whereas this may not be
the case for FPS games, which could afford a broader range
in how each participant could behave during gameplay. Given
that VRCockpit performed better in the car racing game, it is
plausible that our technique is more suitable when applied in
this type of continuous fast-paced context. Further explorations
like comparing different speeds, acceleration, and size of the
2D frames will be helpful in assessing its effectiveness and
application in other scenarios. In this research, we wanted
to validate if VRCockpit is effective in mitigating SS while
maintaining suitable performance and immersion levels, which
we have achieved to a large extent. Optimization issues are part
of our future plans.

We can also conduct a comparative study to contrast our
technique with other existing SS mitigation techniques involv-
ing a larger number of participants. However, such studies are
often non-trivial, as direct comparisons are often limited to
the original choice of environment and not easily transferable
to other environments because it
is generally challenging
to replicate the technique to other scenarios outside of the
original
testbed setting. However, as demonstrated in our
results, the trade-offs of the mitigation technique can be game-
speciﬁc. Finding the best matches between technique(s) and
game type(s) represents potentially a rich avenue for future
research.

IX. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we explored ways to mitigate simulator
sickness (SS) in virtual reality (VR) games. We proposed a
new visual mitigation technique for head-mounted displays
(HMDs), VRCockpit. It surrounds users with four egocentric
frames, one for each cardinal direction, that display 2D repli-
cas of the 3D environment behind each frame. We conducted
two user studies to test our technique with two different
games (a car racing game and a ﬁrst-person shooter game)
and compared it with the baseline condition (with no visual
mitigation technique). Our results show that VRCockpit is able
to reduce SS for participants in general and still allows them to
attain similar levels of immersion and performance in the two
games. Our ﬁndings show that VRCockpit is a useful SS mit-
igation technique and does not change the navigation process,
add additional visual elements to the gaming environment, or
blur/blackout portions of the display.
