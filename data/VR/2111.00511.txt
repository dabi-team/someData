Abstract—Recently, Metaverse has attracted increasing atten-
tion from both industry and academia, because of the signiﬁcant
potential to integrate real and digital worlds ever more seam-
lessly. By combining advanced wireless communications, edge
computing and virtual reality (VR) technologies into Metaverse,
a multidimensional, intelligent and powerful wireless edge Meta-
verse is created for future human society. In this paper, we design
a privacy preserving targeted advertising strategy for the wireless
edge Metaverse. Speciﬁcally, a Metaverse service provider (MSP)
allocates bandwidth to the VR users so that the users can access
Metaverse from edge access points. To protect users’ privacy,
the covert communication technique is used in the downlink.
Then, the MSP can offer high-quality access services to earn
more proﬁts. Motivated by the concept of “covert”, targeted
advertising is used to promote the sale of bandwidth and ensure
that the advertising strategy cannot be detected by competitors
who may make counter-offer and by attackers who want to
disrupt the services. We derive the best advertising strategy in
terms of budget input, with the help of the Vidale-Wolfe model
and Hamiltonian function. Furthermore, we propose a novel
metric named Meta-Immersion to represent the user’s experience
feelings. The performance evaluation shows that the MSP can
boost its revenue with an optimal targeted advertising strategy,
especially compared with that without the advertising.

I. INTRODUCTION

The “Metaverse”, which was ﬁrst proposed by Neal
Stephenson in his novel Snow Crash [1], is a hypothetical
synthetic environment created by computers that are linked to
the physical world. A number of companies, such as Facebook,
Epic Games, and Tencent, have announced their ventures into
Metaverse. Specially, the social media giant Facebook re-
branded itself as “Meta” to build the Metaverse.

For the metaverse, several promising 6G techniques, e.g.,
Terahertz communication and reconﬁgurable intelligent sur-
faces, can be used to provide high data rate and ultra-low
latency communications. Moreover, progresses in the devel-
opment of multimedia technologies, such as remote and non-
panoramic rendering, make wireless virtual reality (VR) and

augmented reality (AR) become the most promising technolo-
gies for accessing the Metaverse [2], [3]. From the perspec-
tive of wireless resource management, a Metaverse service
provider (MSP) needs to determine the bandwidth allocated
to VR users, ensuring normal-quality access to the Metaverse.
The excess bandwidth can be used to provide “high-quality
access service” to users thus making more proﬁts. Note that
advertising is an effective way to promote such new businesses
to entice customers to upgrade their products and services [4].
However, MSPs may avoid their advertisement being de-
tected by competitors and attackers. The reason is that the
advertisement may contain the MSP’s marketing details, target
users’ local information or special characters [5]. Inspired
by the concept of “covertness” in covert communication [6],
the advertising can be hidden in noisy information [7], i.e.,
textual and interpersonal meta-discourse, to avoid potential
attacks. The transmission of information can only be received
by intended users. Thus, the MSP can customize and optimize
the actual advertising effort and the noisy information effort
to make the detection error probability (DEP) of competitors
and attackers close to one. Such a strategy is called targeted
advertising [5], which can be used in many real-life cases.
For example, Horizon Workrooms, a Facebook’s Metaverse
software, can let people have conferences in the same virtual
room. Because we do not want the conference information to
be compromised as well as the competitors to counter-offer
similar services, the advertising of high-quality access should
not be detected by people other than participants.

To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a
targeted advertising management framework of high-quality
access, and investigate a jamming-aided wireless edge Meta-
verse access system to determine the bandwidth required for
normal-quality access. The contributions of this paper can be
summarized as follows.

• We are the ﬁrst to propose a bandwidth allocation scheme
and a targeted advertising strategy for MSPs under budget
constraints. An optimal targeted advertising strategy and
corresponding high-quality access service proﬁt are de-
rived with the help of the Vidale-Wolfe advertising model
[8] and the Hamiltonian function.

• We propose a novel metric called Meta-Immersion
to measure the Metaverse user’s feelings. The Meta-
Immersion indicates the quality of the uplink and down-
link between the user and the metaverse, as well as the
user’s experience in the virtual world.

• We investigate a jamming-aided covert wireless edge
Metaverse access system. To decide how much bandwidth

 
 
 
 
 
 
If a competitor MSP (MSP B) tries to detect the presence of
MSP A’s advertisement in the market, what Company B faces
is a binary decision between the null hypothesis that MSP A is
mute and the non-null hypothesis that MSP A is advertising.
There are two situations where an error in judgment can occur:

jerror =

(cid:26)

Pr (δ1a (t) + δ2e (t) < j (t)) , M iss Detection,
Pr (δ2e (t) > j (t)) , F alse Judgement,

(1)

where j(t) is the judgment thresholds, δ1 and δ2 are the
message numbers suspected by MSP B to be advertisements
under unit advertising and noisy efforts, respectively. Note that
MSP A can adjust e (t) to make jerror close to one.

Let B (t) denote the sales of acceleration bandwidth. With
the help of a variation of Vidale-Wolfe advertising response
model [10], we can express the relationship between the
reduction of B (t) and the targeted advertising effect a (t) as

∂B (t)
∂t

= c1a (t) r1 −

B (t)
M

− η2B (t) ,

(2)

where c1 is the response constant, η2 denotes the decay con-
stant, and M is the saturation level which can be considered
as a constant in analysis [11].

Because the total bandwidth that can be used for high-
quality access is limited, in time period T , we can ﬁnd a T2
that satisﬁes

K

By letting x (t) = B (t)/M, η1 = c1/M, we can re-write (2) as

where x(0) = x0. Let π denote the maximum acceleration
bandwidth sales revenue corresponding to x (t) = 1. Recall
that the cost of advertising is a quadratic function of the effort
[10], the total proﬁt of the MSP can be expressed as

III. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND ANALYSIS

A. Problem Formulation

After meeting the basic bandwidth requirements of the K
users, the MSP wishes to sell acceleration bandwidth to make
more proﬁts. Because the total budget is limited, the budget
used in targeted advertising is bounded by

is needed for normal-quality access, we derive the de-
tection error probability, downlink covert rate (CR), and
uplink bit-error rate (BER) under different modulations.

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND ADVERTISING MODEL

A. System Description

As shown in Fig. 1, we consider an MSP with K users,
and the VR users accesses to the Metaverse using the head-
mounted display (HMD), through EAPs. To prevent the data
transmission from being detected by a malicious warden, a
friendly jammer is introduced to assist the communication by
actively generating jamming signals. For an MSP, the budget
is used not only for the construction of virtual worlds, but also
for ensuring reliable access for its users. Let N denote the total
budget that is planned to be used for Metaverse access over
a period of time, i.e., [0, T1]. The MSP buys BT bandwidth
from the wireless communication providers in unit price pl.

We propose a novel performance metric called Meta-
Immersion (more details in Section IV) to represent user vir-
tual experiences in Metaverse. Hence, to ensure that each user
can achieve the Meta-Immersion requirement, the MSP ﬁrst
provides Bk (k = 1, . . . , K) (called basic bandwidth) to users
with a low price for normal-quality access. The Bk can be
decided by the value of the given minimum Meta-Immersion,
(20), and (29). In addition, some users might want to buy more
bandwidth, such as those who prefer to play the Metaverse
game at lower latency or those who are more sensitive to

cybersickness [9]. The MSP can use

BT −

Bk

(called

acceleration bandwidth) to provide high-quality access service,
but with a higher unit bandwidth price.

B. Covert Advertising Model

The MSP (MSP A) needs to decide its advertising strategies
to attract users to subscribe for the high-quality access service.
Let a (t) denote an actual information advertising effort at time
t, e (t) denote the noisy information effort [7]. Note here that
the advertising effort can be the square root of budget that
the MSP uses to deliver advertising messages to the targeted
customers, and the noisy information is cost-free [10].

Because plBT is given, the equivalent optimal control formu-
lation is then given as follows.

B. Optimal Covert Advertising Solution

To obtain the optimal targeted advertising strategy, we solve
the proﬁt maximization problem with the help of Pontryagin’s
maximum principle [12]. The current-value Hamiltonian H
can be expressed as

H =πx (t) + λ1 (t)

i.e., (6), we can solve that λ2 = C2, where

C2 > 0. The relationship between C2 and (N − plBT ) will
be discussed later.

Substituting (16) into (17), after some algebraic manipulations,
we can solve J ∗ as (13) to complete the proof.
Remark 1. Substituting (16) into (6), we can obtain that C2

In practical situation where the MSP has a limited advertising
budget, N − plBT , the detailed steps for ﬁnding the C2 and
optimal advertising budget allocation strategy are similar to
[8, Algorithm 1].

observe that increasing

for the MSP to allocate as little basic bandwidth as possible
while satisfying the user’s minimal Meta-Immersion.

IV. META-IMMERSION OF USERS

p

Thus, the optimal targeted advertising management strategy in
feedback form can be obtained as (12). Substituting (12) into
(11) and (4), and letting ∂λ1(t)
∂t = 0, we can obtain
the optimal long-run stationary equilibrium [10] as (14), and
a∗ (t) can be derived by substituting (14) into (12). To obtain
the optimal paths for x and λ1 for any given value of x0, we
set λ1 (0) = ¯λ1 in (11) and (4) [10]. Thus, we can obtain

∂t = ∂x(t)

x (t) = (x0 − ¯x) e
λ1 (t) = ¯λ1.

To determine the basic bandwidth that an MSP should
allocate to its users, we ﬁrst propose a novel metric to represent
the user feelings in the Metaverse. We divide the users’
experience and service indicators into three groups, shown as
Fig. 2. The technical indicators are discussed as follows:

the minimum packet error rate is 10−2. By considering

• Uplink Tracking Bit Error Rate (Eu

• Downlink Data Rate

(cid:0)

that the packet length is 103 bit [14], a recommended
BER could be 10−5.

• Virtual Experience (Sk): This indicator depends on the
subjective behavior of the user, such as activity in the
Metaverse, the length of online time, the user’s physical
ﬁtness, etc. Quantifying of Sk can be done with the help
of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

Because the main contribution of this paper is to investigate
the Metaverse covert access, we consider Sk is ﬁxed. A
EAP transmits the data signals to user k, and the downlink
bandwidth is Bk. In the following, we derive the warden’s
DEP ξw, Rd

k, and Eu
k .

A. Channel Model

We consider that jamming links follow the α − µ distri-
bution, which includes several important distributions such
as the One-Sided Gaussian, Rayleigh (when the jamming
channels are frequency-ﬂat), Nakagami-m (when the jamming
channels are frequency-selective) and Weibull [15]. Let Υ ∼
αµ (α, µ, ¯γ), where Υ is a squared α − µ RV. The PDF of Υ

We consider that data links follow the Fisher-Snedecor F
fading, which can give an accurate modeling of the simul-
taneous occurrence of multi-path fading and shadowing, and
covers several fading models. Let Z ∼ F (m, ms, ¯κ), the PDF
and CDF of the squared F RV Z can be written as [17]

fZ (z) =

we can obtain Rd

C. Bit Error Rate Analysis

We consider that jamming signals’ interference to the EAP
can be neglected, because the frequency division multiplexing
is typically used in the downlink and uplink. The signal-to-

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Simulation results are presented to verify the proposed
analysis in this section. We set ha = 3, η2 = 1.3, π = 10,
T1 = 5, aU = 0.9, x0 = 0.3, N = 20, and pl = 0.4. With the
help of Theorem 1, the optimal targeted advertising strategy
and corresponding high-quality access service market share
can be obtained, shown in Fig. 3. If the MSP does not use
advertising, the service market share will decrease quickly.
Moreover, the advertising response constant is critical to the
MSP’s proﬁts. The x(t) increases with the increase of time
t when η1 = 2, but decreases when η1 = 0.4. The reason is
that larger η1 means the same targeted advertising investment
can obtain greater effect. Furthermore, the more budget an
MSP has for targeted advertising, the faster the acceleration
bandwidth can be sold for the high-quality access service. Note
that T2 decreases when the basic bandwidth requirement to
meet the user’s minimal Meta-Immersion increases.

Figure 4 shows that the user’s downlink CR and noise
versus the allocated bandwidth, with msak = 2, mak = 3,
µjk = 2, αjk = 2, pa = 10 dBW, ¯γjk = 5 dBW, and
different ¯κak. The warden adjusts its detection threshold, ε,
dynamically and the jammer adjusts the jamming power to
ensure the covertness of the communication, which means that
we always have (1 − ξw) < δ, where δ is an arbitrarily small
number. Here we set δ = 3%. We can observe that, when ¯κak
is larger, which means that the channel condition is better, we
can allocate less bandwidth to the user to achieve the minimum
requirement of downlink covert rate. As shown in Fig. 4, the
increase in bandwidth also brings an increase in noise, which
should be considered in some noise sensitive scenes.

Figure 5 depicts the uplink BER versus the transmit power
of HMD, with ¯κka = 10 dBW, σ2
ka = 1 dBW, different
channel parameters and modulations. We can observe that the
error rate decrease 80.7% when the transmit power increases
from 6 dBW to 8 dBW, when DPSK is used, mka = 4, and
mska = 4. Moreover, the channel condition has a great impact
on the uplink performance. From Fig. 5, it can be observed
that the minimal required transmit power decreases 9 dBW
when mska and mka increase 1 and 2, respectively. Changing
the modulation format from BFSK to DPSK can decrease
the required transmit power by 1.2 dBW. Considering that

VI. CONCLUSION

We proposed a bandwidth allocation and targeted advertis-
ing scheme for wireless edge MSP, under budget constraints.
After allocating basic bandwidth to users for normal-quality
access, the MSP offers high-quality access services to make
more proﬁts. With the help of targeted advertising, acceleration
bandwidth sales were boosted and the existence of advertise-
ments cannot be detected by competitors. To determine the ba-
sic bandwidth, we proposed a novel metric, Meta-Immersion,
to represent
the user’s feelings in the Metaverse. Several
technical indicators, such as the DEP, downlink CR, and uplink
BER under different modulation schemes were derived. We
observed that the channel conditions of users can highly affect
the experience in the Metaverse, and targeted advertising plays
an important role in the sale of acceleration bandwidth. For
future directions, many issues about advertising and Metaverse
access can be studied, such as joint optimization of resource
pricing and advertising.
