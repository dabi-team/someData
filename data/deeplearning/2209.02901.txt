Abstract— Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is important 
in clinic to produce high resolution images for diagnosis, but its 
acquisition  time  is  long  for  high  resolution  images.  Deep 
learning based MRI super resolution methods can reduce scan 
time  without  complicated  sequence  programming,  but  may 
create  additional  artifacts  due  to  the  discrepancy  between 
training  data  and  testing  data.  Data  consistency  layer  can 
improve the deep learning results but needs raw k-space data. 
In  this  work,  we  propose  a  magnitude-image  based  data 
consistency  deep  learning  MRI  super  resolution  method  to 
improve super resolution images’ quality without raw k-space 
data.  Our  experiments  show  that  the  proposed  method  can 
improve  NRMSE  and  SSIM  of  super  resolution  images 
compared  to  the  same  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN) 
block without data consistency module.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Medical  Imaging  Devices  are  often  used  in  clinical 
scenarios 
to  help  with  diagnostic  process.  Magnetic 
Resonance  Imaging  (MRI)  is  considered  one  of  the  most 
important modalities for its high resolution and good contrast 
in soft tissues; however, it requires long acquisition time for 
scanning high resolution images (especially for 3D images). 
One  conventional  method  to  reduce  the  acquisition  time  is 
using the compressed sensing method [1], which is to utilize 
random undersampling pattern to reduce the acquisition time. 
However, the method needs to change acquisition scheme and 
parameter  fine-tuning  in  reconstruction,  which  makes  it 
difficult to be applied in many clinical settings. 

Recently,  deep-learning  based  MR  super  resolution 
methods have been proven to be good ways of reducing scan 
time without complicated sequence programming [2-5]. After 
quick  low-resolution  (LR)  image  acquisition,  the  neural 
network  can  efficiently  output  the  corresponding  super-
resolution (SR) image. However, the performance of purely 
data-driven neural network is solely based on its training data, 

and  may  create  additional  artifacts  in  the  testing  due  to  the 
discrepancy between training data and testing data.  

In  the  realm  of  deep  learning  MR  reconstruction,  data 
consistency (DC) layer [6-8], which incorporates the raw k-
space  data  into  the  neural  network,  has  been  applied  to 
improve  the  deep  learning  reconstruction’s  accuracy  over 
purely  data-driven  models.  However,  to  the  best  of  our 
knowledge, there is no previous work on using DC layer in 
deep learning MR super resolution. One potential reason for 
that  is  most  previous  MR  super  resolution  works  only  have 
magnitude images for training and lack raw k-space due to the 
dataset availability.  

In  this  work,  we  propose  a  magnitude-image  based  DC 
deep learning MR super resolution method and show that it is 
feasible and beneficial to apply DC layer without raw k-space 
in  MR  super  resolution.  When  the  phase  variation  of  a 
complex  MR  image  is  small,  there  is  not  much  difference 
between magnitude image and complex image. Even if there 
is difference, the network can learn to compensate for that part 
in supervised learning. Therefore, in the case of small image 
phase  variation,  we  propose  that  we  can  use  the  k-space  of 
magnitude  LR  image  to  approximate  the  raw  k-space  and 
apply the DC layer without the true raw k-space.  

For comparison, we have also trained a SR network that 
has the same structure as the proposed method but without the 
proposed magnitude-image based DC layer. The Normalized 
Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Structural Similarity 
(SSIM) were used to evaluate the SR imaging qualities. The 
proposed method is shown to improve the SR image quality 
and reduce the artifacts over the SR model without DC layer. 

II.  THEORY 

A.  Problem Formulation 

The  MR  super  resolution  problem  can  be  treated  as  a 
special  case  of  undersampling  MR  reconstruction,  in  which 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  sampling  mask  is  central  k-space  lines.  The  acquisition 
process can be written as: 

𝑏 = 𝑀𝐹𝑥 + 𝜖

(1) 

Here  𝑥 ∈ ℂ!  is  the  vectorized  original  high-resolution 
(HR) MR image (𝑁 = 𝑁" × 𝑁#), 𝐹 is the Fourier Transform 
operator,  𝑀 ∈ ℝ$×!  ( 𝑀 < 𝑁 )  is  a  sampling  mask  matrix 
composed  of  1  and  0, 𝑏 is  the  vectorized  acquired  k-space 
data, and 𝜖 is the random noise during the acquisition. 

Conventionally,  the  regularized  minimization  is  used  to 

solve 𝑥 from 𝑏: 

𝑥 = arg min

"

‖𝑀𝐹𝑥 − 𝑏‖&

& + 𝜆𝑅(𝑥)	

(2) 

Here 𝑅 is a regularization term to help solve the ill-posed 
problem,  and 𝜆  is  the  regularization  factor.  In  compressed 
sensing [1],  𝑅 typically involves L1 norm in the sparsifying 
domain of 𝑥.  

B.  Data Consistency Layer 

In  some  recent  deep  learning  reconstruction  works,  data 
consistency  (DC)  layer  [6,  7]  was  proposed  to  improve  the 
reconstruction’s performance. In DC layer, the convolutional 
neural  network  (CNN)  prediction  image  𝑥’((  is  combined 
with the data fidelity term in (2), and the new minimization 
problem becomes: 

𝑥)’ = arg min

‖𝑀𝐹𝑥 − 𝑏‖&

& 	
& + 𝜆‖𝑥 − 𝑥’((‖&

"

(3) 

In the case of Cartesian undersampling, (3) has a closed 

form solution: 

𝑠’(((𝑖)			𝑖𝑓	𝑖 ∉ Ω

𝑠)’(𝑖) = @

𝜆𝑠’(((𝑖) + 𝑠*(𝑖)
1 + 𝜆
Here  𝑠)’ = 𝐹𝑥)’ ,  𝑠’(( = 𝐹𝑥’(( ,  𝑠* ∈ ℂ!  is  the  zero-
padded  vectorized  acquired  k-space.  Ω  is  the  set  of  the 
acquired k-space points.  

	𝑖𝑓	𝑖 ∈ Ω

(4) 

Therefore,  (4)  can  be  used  to  construct  DC  layer  in  the 
deep learning MR reconstruction when the acquired k-space 𝑏 
and the sampling mask 𝑀 are known. 

C.  DC Layer for Magnitude MR Super Resolution 

The  raw  k-space  data  are  usually  unavailable  in  clinical 
settings  because  the  scanner  usually  exports  magnitude 
DICOM images to radiologists. To be a clinical practical MR 
super  resolution  method,  it  will  be  the  best  to  only  use 
magnitude  low  resolution  (LR)  images  as  inputs,  without 
requiring raw k-space data.  

The magnitude LR image can be expressed as: 

0 |
$ = |𝐹-.𝑀𝐹𝑥/,
𝑥+,

(5) 

0
Here  𝑥/,

 represents  the  complex  HR  image  (the 

superscript 𝐶 means complex while 𝑀 means magnitude).  

In  general,  𝐹𝑥+,

$ = 𝐹|𝐹-.𝑀𝐹𝑥/,
,  which 
means we cannot treat the Fourier Transform of the magnitude 
LR image as the raw k-space data 𝑏, and the DC layer in (3) 
cannot be formulated. 

0
0 | ≠ 𝑀𝐹𝑥/,

However, if 𝑥/,

0  has a very small phase variation and can 
0 |), 
0 ≈ |𝑥/,
be  approximated  to  a  real-value  image  (i.e., 𝑥/,
 when  𝑀  is  a 
then  𝐹𝑥+,
symmetric sampling mask to the k-space center. Next, we can 
replace 𝑏 with 𝐹𝑥+,

$ = 𝐹|𝐹-.𝑀𝐹𝑥/,

0
0 | ≈ 𝑀𝐹𝑥/,

$  in (3): 

𝑥)’ = arg min

"

‖𝑀𝐹𝑥 − 𝐹𝑥+,

$ ‖&

& 	
& + 𝜆‖𝑥 − 𝑥’((‖&

(6) 

The solution of (6) has the same form as (4), but the 𝑠* is 
no longer the acquired k-space but the k-space vectorized from 
$ . Therefore, we can have a magnitude-image based DC 
𝐹𝑥+,
layer for MR super resolution. 

It is known that the phase variation in MRI often comes 
0 ≈
0 | can be established when the scanner has good shimming 

from  B0  field  inhomogeneity  and  flows.  Therefore, 𝑥/,
|𝑥/,
and there is no major flow in the imaging slice. 

III.  EXPERIMENT 

A.  Datasets and preprocessing 

We use NYU fastMRI dataset in this work [9]. A total of 
720 2D knee image slices were used in this work. We divided 
the dataset into training, validation and testing sets with the 
ratio of 8:1:1 (580 slices for training, 70 slices for validation, 
and 70 slices for testing).  

The original k-space in the fastMRI dataset is regarded as 
the k-space of HR reference images. To generate the k-space 
of LR inputs, we crop the center of HR k-space in the phase 
encoding direction (Fig. 1), and the undersampling factor is 4. 
Then  both  HR  k-space  and  LR  k-space  are  converted  to 
magnitude  images  by  inverse  Fourier  Transform  and  taking 
absolute  value  (Fig.  1).  Both  LR  input  and  HR  reference 
images are normalized by their 95 percentiles before training 
and testing.  

We have calculated the phase variation in our dataset to 
make sure that the small phase variation condition in session 
II-C holds for our dataset. The average phase variation in the 
whole dataset is  36.8°, which is considered as a small phase 
variation.

denotes to number of filters and (s) denotes to stride.  

The proposed method’s network consists of two parts: the 
ResNet  [10]  super  resolution  module  (Fig.  2)  and  the 
magnitude-image based DC layer that is described in session 
II-C. The 𝜆 in (4) is set to be a trainable parameter in our DC 
layer. An unrolled network structure with several iterations is 
used in the proposed method to combine ResNet module and 
DC layer (Fig. 3). For all the iterations in the unrolled network, 
the ResNet modules share the same parameter values.  

To  evaluate  the  benefit  of  the  proposed  DC  layer,  we 
trained another network that only has the ResNet in Fig. 2 (no 
DC layer) for comparison.  

Experiments are conducted through TensorFlow with one 
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. The loss function is the 
mean absolute value (MAE) between SR output images and 
HR references images. The optimizer is Adam, and learning 
rate  is  set  to  2e-4.  We  trained  the  networks  for  35  epochs 
respectively  for  both  the  proposed  network  and  the  ResNet 
without DC.  

For  the  proposed  unrolled  network,  the  number  of 
iterations 𝑁 in Fig. 3 can be set to different values to assess 
the  influence  of  number  of  iterations  on  the  final  image 
quality. In our experiment, we have trained and evaluated for 
𝑁 = 1, 2, 3, 4. For each 𝑁 value, the whole unrolled network 
was retrained for 35 epochs.  

C.  Evaluation 
  Normalized  Root  Mean  Square  Error  (NRMSE)  and 
Structural  Similarity  (SSIM)  were  used  to  evaluate  the  SR 
imaging  quality  of  the  proposed  unrolled  model  and  the 
ResNet-only model. The original HR images in Fig. 1 were 
the  reference  images  when  computing  NRMSE  and  SSIM. 

Paired t-test was used to determine the statistical significance 
of different values.  

  To visually evaluate the imaging quality of different SR 
models,  we  will  show  one  example  slice  for  different  SR 
images and the corresponding LR and HR images.  

IV.  RESULTS 

The NRMSE and SSIM of different SR models among the 
testing set are shown in Table I. It can be observed that ResNet 
without DC improves the imaging quality from LR input, and 
the unrolled model improves the imaging quality from ResNet 
w/o DC. The unrolled model’s performance is affected by the 
number  of  iterations  ( 𝑁 ),  and  𝑁 = 1	𝑜𝑟	2  shows  the  best 
results in our experiment. For the unrolled model with 1 or 2 
iterations, the NRMSE and SSIM are statistically significantly 
better than ResNet w/o DC (p<0.001).

      Fig. 4 shows an example image slice of SR images from 
different  models  as  well  as  the  corresponding  LR  and  HR 
images. It can be clearly observed that ResNet w/o DC may 
produce  some  artifacts  in  the  SR  output,  but  the  proposed 
unrolled model can remove such artifacts, improving the SR 
output’s fidelity and imaging quality.

V.  DISCUSSION 

In this work, we have shown that the proposed magnitude-
image  based  DC  layer  can  improve  the  imaging  quality  of 
deep  learning  MR  super  resolution  even  without  the 
information of raw k-space data. The magnitude-image based 
DC  layer  has  significantly  enlarged  DC  layer’s  scope  of 
application because most clinical MR images don’t come with 
raw k-space data. And the magnitude-image based DC layer 
can be applied to other fields like MR reconstruction.  

The  focus  of  the  work  is  to  show  the  improvement  of 
magnitude-image based DC layer in MR super resolution. We 
haven’t fine-tuned the CNN structure, and we only use small 
network and small dataset for simplicity. But our DC layer can 
be implemented with any advanced CNN blocks and improve 
their performance.  

According to the results in Table I, it is good to use small 
iteration  numbers  like  1  or  2  when  applying  the  proposed 
method.  The  results  in  Table  I  shows  that  the  proposed 
unrolled  model’s  performance  does  not  monotonically 
improve  with  the  increasing  of  iteration  numbers,  which  is 
different from the results of the previous DC layer works [6]. 
This difference may be explained by the difference between 
the  proposed  magnitude-image  based  DC  layer  and  the 
previous raw k-space based DC layer. Our magnitude-image 
based DC layer is not fully accurate in the data fidelity term 
as was shown in session II-C, so the reconstruction error may 
accumulate  after 
iteration  numbers. 
However, this issue does not hurt the benefits of the proposed 
method  in  the  case  of  no  available  raw  k-space,  because 
previous DC layers cannot even operate when the raw k-space 
data are absent.  

increasing  of 

the 

For future work, we will compare the proposed magnitude 
DC layer vs. complex DC layer and include more recent SR 
networks  for  comparison.  Meanwhile,  we  will  research  the 
relationship between the performance of magnitude DC layer 
and phase variation strength.  

VI.  CONCLUSION 

In this work, we developed a magnitude-image based DC 
layer to improve deep learning MR super resolution without 

raw  k-space  data.  Our  experiments  show  that  the  proposed 
method  can  improve  NRMSE  and  SSIM  of  SR  images 
compared to the same CNN block without DC layer.  

Previous DC network requires raw k-space data, which are 
not  included  in  many  clinical  MR  scans  and  public  MR 
datasets. The proposed method may open a new door for the 
application  of  DC  layer  in  MR  super  resolution  and 
reconstruction  since  the  available  dataset  are  significantly 
enlarged with magnitude images.
