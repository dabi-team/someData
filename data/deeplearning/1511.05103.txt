Abstract. Space weather is a rapidly growing area not only in scientiﬁc and
engineering applications but also in physics education and in the interest of the public.
We focus especially on space radiation and its impact on space exploration. The topic
is highly interdisciplinary bringing together fundamental concepts of nuclear physics
with aspects of radiation protection and space science. We present a new approach
to presenting the topic by developing a web-based tool that combines some of the
fundamental concepts from these two ﬁelds in a single tool that can be developed in
the context of advanced secondary or undergraduate university education.

We present DREADCode, an outreach or teaching tool to asses rapidly the current
conditions of the radiation ﬁeld in space. DREADCode uses the available data feeds
from a number of ongoing space missions (ACE, GOES-13, GOES-15) to produce a
ﬁrst order approximation of the dose an astronaut would receive during a mission of
exploration in deep space (i.e. far from the Earth’s shielding magnetic ﬁeld and from
the radiation belts).

DREADcode is based on a easy to use GUI interface available online from the
European Space Weather Portal (http://www.spaceweather.eu/dreadcode). The
core of the radiation transport computation to produce the radiation dose from the
observed ﬂuence of radiation observed by the spacecraft ﬂeet considered is based on
a relatively simple approximation: the Bethe-Block equation. DREADCode assumes
also a simpliﬁed geometry and material conﬁguration for the shields used to compute
the dose. The approach is approximate and it sacriﬁces some important physics on the
altar of a rapid execution time allowing a real time operation scenario.

There is no intention here to produce an operational tool for use in the space science
and engineering. Rather we present an educational tool at undergraduate level that
uses modern web-based and programming methods to learn some of the most important
concepts in the application of radiation protection to space weather problems.

1. Introduction

Exploring space is no gala dinner.

The space environment is particularly rich in ionizing radiations and can be highly

lethal (Schimmerling et al., 2003).

Radiation encompasses all forms of energy emitted by a speciﬁc source moving
through space by means of either particles or electromagnetic waves. More speciﬁcally,

 
 
 
 
 
 
Web-based description of the space radiation environment using the Bethe-Bloch model2

ionizing radiation refers to the strong interaction between high energetic charged
particles and the material they travel into.
In turn, the ionizing radiation is further
split in two categories: directly and indirectly ionizing radiation. The former considers
all the charged particles directly coming from the source and not changing its charge
status on the way. The second group instead consists of the secondary ionizing particles
produced after the interaction with a primary particle, which can be either charged or
neutral, with the medium.

Two main sources of ionizing radiation are present in the interplanetary space:
cosmic rays and solar energetic particles (SEP)(Bothmer and Daglis, 2007). Both vary
in time. Cosmic rays are always present at levels that when accumulated over time pose
serious risk of cancer to people and of damage to technology. SEP are sporadic but
when they hit, the damage can be devastating.

Solar energeric particles are released during speciﬁc solar events, also called solar
eruptions, including coronal mass ejections and solar ﬂares, which are able to send
out an enormous amount of highly energetic particles all over the heliosphere. SPE
also includes those particles eventually accelerated through the interaction with some
speciﬁc event in space, such as shocks.

All these threats are part of the rapidly growing discipline named by space weather,
including all astrophysical and space processes impacting humans and technology in
space or on the Earth (see Schrijver et al. (2015) for more information and a complete
deﬁnition of space weather).

A strong solar eruption can produce dangerous doses of radiation even at relatively
low orbits where the geomagnetic ﬁeld provides some shielding and deﬁnitely lethal for
deep space missions. Manned missions of exploration have to be planned with careful
attention to the space weather threat posed by radiation. For this task numerous
statistical studies and computational tools have been developed so that a mission is
planned under diﬀerent scenarios and considering the plausible worst case scenario. de
Models include solar energetic particles produced by space weather events (King, 1974;
Feynman et al., 1990, 1993, 2002; Xapsos et al., 2004, 1999, 2000; Rosenqvist et al.,
2005; ISO TS 15391), galactic cosmic rays (Nymmik et al., 1992, 1996; ISO TS 15390),
as well as the radiation belts environment (Sawyer and Vette, 1976; Vette, 1991a,b).

Many tools have been proposed in literature in order to evaluate the radiation risks

that astronauts undergo during space missions (SPENVIS website, http://www.spenvis.oma.be;
SEPEM website, http://dev.sepem.oma.be; Singleterry Jr et al., 2011; Slaba et al.,
2010; Singleterry Jr et al., 2011; Schwadron et al., 2010; Tylka et al., 1997; Peyrard et al.,
2003).

The focus is of course on the near Earth environment where for decades now
human presence has been limited to. But the tools also include deeper space
exploration. Once a deep space mission is ongoing, a task unfortunately not occurred
since Apollo 17 in December 1972, there is another need: to monitor space radiation
in real time to assess the current conditions and make predictions of developing
solar events. This task is not of immediate need because of the lack of manned

Web-based description of the space radiation environment using the Bethe-Bloch model3

missions since 1972, but is nevertheless a task to consider in planning a future
return to manned exploration. World-wide space agencies and private ventures are
now planning to undertake interplanetary journeys to celestial bodies, such as the
Moon, Mars and asteroids (Reichert, 2001; Stanley et al., 2005; Hoﬀman et al., 1997;
Aeronautics and Administration, 2012). Radiation risks during these missions will
be extreme (Horneck et al., 2003b,c,a; Crosby, 2007; Durante and Cucinotta, 2011a;
Reitz and Facius, 2007).

The study of this topic requires fundamental concepts of nuclear physics that
determine how radiation interacts with matter. But understanding the topic requires
one to consider the diﬀerent sources of high energy particles in space and aspects typical
of radiation protection to assess the impact on technology or on astronauts.

We present here an educational project that uses the existing satellites monitoring
space (and future as they will become available) to asses quickly, albeit approximately,
the current risk of dose exposure. The concept of dose and the related diﬀerent ways to
compute are described in the section 2.1.

The goal is for a real time tool giving the current conditions available from the
feeds of the existing monitoring satellites. The focus is only on deep space missions (i.e.
we are not concerned here with radiation belts where other tools are already available
(Sawyer and Vette, 1976; Vette, 1991a,b)).

The idea of the present work, then, is to develop a new fast tool able to assess doses
received by human tissues taking into account particle datasets directly recorded by
satellites, in order to provide the most realistic assessment of the present space situation.
Furthermore, to reduce the computational eﬀort, as core of the computation, a ﬁrst-order
non-linear diﬀerential equation is considered in lieu of Monte Carlo simulations.

This design choice make the computation faster and more general, although the
ﬁnal results will be less precise and less speciﬁc compared with those obtained from
Monte Carlo.

Nevertheless, this approach still maintains a good approximation in light of the
physics carried by heavy charged particles. It is well estalished that a single charged
particle behaves quite more diﬀerently than a neutral particle in passing through the
matter. We know that the mean free path will be much shorter, and the interaction
predominantly due a long-range electromagnetic interaction with the target atoms,
making the single collisions negligible. As result, the overall trajectory within the matter
turns out to appear in ﬁrst approximation straight, removing the necessity of using
a Monte Carlo random-walk. Moreover, a set of particles with the same properties
will behave nearly in the same way, being not aﬀected by the single point-to-point
interaction.

Based upon these latter considerations, the macroscopic quantity stopping power
is deﬁned as the capability of a particular material to slow down an incoming particle
through diﬀerent type of interactions. The result is the loss of the initial particle energy
along its path through the target material, so that the stopping power is related to
the concept of linear energy transfer. The practical use of this quantity is provided in

Web-based description of the space radiation environment using the Bethe-Bloch model4

section 3.2, where the Bethe-Bloch equation is introduced.

Given the educational goal, at the undergraduate level, this approach, even with
its limitations for real world professional applications, is preferable as a way to make
students familiar with real-time monitoring of space radiation and the assessment of its
dangerousness. Additional educational endeavours can ask the students to replace the
simple transport model used here with more advanced and accurate radiation transport
methods.

The tool presented here, given the topic of application, has been named

DREADCode. In summary its peculiarities are:

•

•

•

•

data values directly taken from satellites, which leads to an almost real-time
assessment and to a more realistic approach

fast computation of radiation transport thanks to the use of the Bethe-Bloch
equation considering all the correction factors introduced over time

opportunity to choose material and composition of each layer is supposed to shield
the incoming particles

opportunity to assess the dose situation at diﬀerent distances from the Sun, which
means considering the Interplanetary Space surrounding those planets closer to the
Sun. Accuracy and precision at longer distances need further investigations, which
are beyond the scope of this work and not well understood yet in the literature.
Considering only the portion of the interplanetary space we are interested (i.e.
utmost up to the Mars distance) allows for removing the constraint concerning its
high spatial variability. Temporal variations are instead intrinsically well described
by the input satellite dataset.

The code is written in MATLAB for its educational scope and has been
recently made available online on the European Space Weather Portal website
(ESWP, European Space Weather Portal website, http://www.spaceweather.eu), within
the biological eﬀects section (DREADCode, DREADCode link, http://www.spaceweather.eu/biological eﬀects

The paper is organized as follows. Given the highly interdisciplinary nature of
the material presented, section 2 gives a brief description of the radiation sources of
major importance in space, as well as an introductory on the main dosimetric quantities
further used in the work. Section 3 describes the DREADCode structure, highlighting its
modules and their integrations. Section 4 provides validation and veriﬁcation results,
while conclusions and future directions are provided in section 5, together with the
educational potentiality of the tool.

2. Radiation Sources and Eﬀects

During interplanetary missions, astronauts are going to face ionizing radiations coming
from diﬀerent sources: besides the aforementioned sources (i.e. SEP and Cosmic Rays),
it is worthy to additionally mention the solar wind and the radiation belts.

Web-based description of the space radiation environment using the Bethe-Bloch model5

The former represents the continuous stream of low energy charged particles from
the Sun (predominantly protons at nearly 400 km
through 800 kms, meaning few KeV
s
or less) in a way similar to the terrestial wind. For our purposes, the solar wind can
be neglected as modern spacecraft are already equipped with properly designed shields
against these particles.

The radiaton belts are instead regions of relatively high energy particles trapped
within the planetary magnetic ﬁelds, and literally surrounding those planets provided
of a magnetosphere (e.g. Earth and Mercury). Similarly to the solar wind, also this
source of radiation can be neglected due to the short time spent by astronauts within
them during the mission.

In contrast, we cannot neglect the solar energetic particles at all, as being very
unpredictable, either in time or in magnitude, and very problematic for interplanetary
journeys. To date, it seems in fact to be impossible to properly design shields without
increasing dramatically masses, volumes and, consequently, mission costs. These
particles are directly originated in the Sun and released after the occurrence of extreme
solar events, such Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).

Finally, Galactic Cosmic Rays and Anomalous Cosmic Rays are ﬂuxes of particles,
ranging from proton to uranium nucleii, coming from galactic and extra-galactic
origins, whose path is undeﬁned as they can undertake many deﬂections within the
interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) before reaching the target. Consequently, the
population of these particles inside the heliosphere is strictly function of the IMF
strength, which in turn is function of the solar activity. Although we considered GCR
and ACR as the same entity, indeed, the sources of these particles are strongly diﬀerent
(Durante and Cucinotta, 2011b). GCRs are basically charged particles coming from the
deep space, ﬂowing around the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld lines and being accelerated
when eventually encountering particular astrophysical events, such as shocks. ACRs
are instead neutral particles coming from interstellar material, which happen to be
weakly ionized through the interaction with the Solar Wind as soon as they enter the
heliosphere (Schrijver and Siscoe (2010)). The latter are therefore mainly composed by
weakly-ionized heavy nucleii which have lost only their outer atomic electrons, resulting
much less inﬂuenced by the IMF than GCRs. Additionally, they show a signiﬁcantly
lower energy spectrum than GCRs.

2.1. Dose and Biological Eﬀects

Main concern of radiations is the danger they can cause to devices and, mostly, to
biological tissues. Historically, the main diﬃculty in assessing their dangerousness has
always been ﬁnding the best approach to link the macroscopic physical causes, such
as the presence of a large scale radiation ﬁeld, to the microscopic eﬀects caused at
lower scales inside the matter. An ultimate common agreement on what is the quantity
best accomplishing this task is still far to come. Even though being no the solely
suggested quantities, DREADCode takes into account the currently most used standard

deﬁnitions for radiometry and dosimetry. These deﬁnitions are scientiﬁcally motivated
and are incorporated into regulatory assessments (Valentin, 2007; ICRP, 2007, 2010).

Eﬀective Dose and Ambient Dose Equivalent Main output of the code are the eﬀective
dose and the ambient dose equivalent.

biological eﬀects to the macroscopic radiation ﬁelds in which the target is eventually
found.
it has been proved that diﬀerent organs or tissues of the
human body have diﬀerent reactions to the same incoming radiation. This property
is called radio-sensitivity. The radio-sensitivity is intimately related to both the cellular
reparation capability of the single organ or tissue, and the cellular renovation rate

(Shultis and Faw, 2002). The eﬀective dose gives an estimation of the diﬀerent radio-
sensitivity of a biological tissue and is computed as

where HT is the equivalent dose received by the tissue T and wT are coeﬃcients called
tissue weighting factors. The total sum of these coeﬃcients is equal to 1 for a whole body
exposure. Recent values of wT are given in table 1, together with the radiation weighting
factors necessary to compute the equivalent dose. In analyzing these values, which are
continuously updated through experimental and simulation campaigns, noticeable is the
relation between the greatest factors and those organs expected to have higher cellular
renovation rates. Like the equivalent dose, the eﬀective dose is expressed in Sv - Sievert.
Practically, the eﬀective dose turns out to be very helpful when the exposure is well
known and deﬁned. However, when it comes to evaluate the ionizing eﬀects in cases
where the exposure of the target is not totally clear, the latter becomes less handy.
Glaring example is the variable position astronauts are keeping during the diﬀerent
stages of a long-term mission.

A more suited dose quantity has therefore been introduced, namely the ambient
dose equivalent. According to the deﬁnition appointed in Valentin (2007) and ICRP
(2007, 2010), this quantity represents the equivalent dose computed at 10 mm radially
inside a ICRU-sphere, when the radiaton ﬁeld is intended to be aligned (i.e. oriented),
expanded and oppositely oriented with respect to the sphere, as indicatively shown
in ﬁgure 2. The ICRU sphere is a 30 cm-diameter sphere made of speciﬁc elements
(76.2 % O, 11.1 % C, 10.1 % H and 2.6 % N) recalling the human tissue composition,
with density equals to 1 g/cc (ICRU, 1980).

3. DREADCode: main features

DREADCode has a modular structure. Figure 3 shows a ﬂowchart describing the main
inputs, the computational core and the main outputs. Besides data sources, time period

and shield properties, the user can also set up other features, including the exposure
and the scaling factor, as well as what speciﬁc coeﬃcients one prefers using for each
output assessment.

The main features of the DREADCode are listed in order.
First, as input DREADCode receives particle ﬂux data directly from satellites
recordings. Only the true sources of radiation concern are considered: charged nuclei,
from proton to uranium nuclei. Future versions will consider also neutral particles
(neutrons, gamma rays), for now neglected.

This approach leads to an (almost) real-time assessment. A delay is still present due
to the raw data satellite’s processing required before the data is made available by the
responsible agency (NOAA for the data sources used). Moreover, the user has to insert
the shields or layers properties, such as thickness, material and elements composition.
Second, a radiation transport calculation is required to evaluate how many particles
with a particular energy are able to penetrate the shields under consideration. For
this task, a simpliﬁed model is used, instead of the more computational demanding
Monte Carlo method. This aspect will be subject to future evolution and improvement
and is currently motivated by the need for computational speed to achieve real-time
performance.

An example of what stated above is given in ﬁgure 4, where snapshots taken
from the on-line DREADCode are shown.
In particular, after inserting the general
necessary inputs, such as the time period, distance from the Sun and type of exposure
of the analyzing object, the user has also to deﬁne the layers properties. Firstly, the
knowledge of how many layers are present between the external radiation sources and
the ﬁnal target, i.e. human tissues, it is necessary. This ﬁgure represents the case with a
single layer, e.g. an aluminium-based wall. Thereafter, for each layer one has to deﬁne
its material, which may be single or multiple compounds, the relative weight fraction
composition, in percentage, and, ﬁnally, its thickness.

At the end, the user can select what type of particle data input considering, i.e.

hosted on the European Space Weather Portal. Here it is possible to notice three main
sections: inside the main input parameters one can insert the time period and other
general inputs concerning the exposure. In the middle, instead, it is shown the layer
properties mask, where the user deﬁnes all those layers existing between sources and
the target. Finally, on the right the radiation environment section is devoted to the
radiation source choice and the output features

which satellite and/or model, as well as the desired output. In case of the eﬀective dose,
one has also to select the type of exposure and what conversion coeﬃcients to use.

Results are ﬁnally represented with a graphics interface page. An example is given
in ﬁgure 5 showing the case analyzed later in section 4. This page gives a summary of
the input parameters, as well as results for any requested output.

Concluding on the main code features, it is remarkable that any time the user
inserts an erroneous value inside the GUI, the code returns an output page indicating
what the insertion error might be. This also occurs when the code itself is not able
to link with the necessary websites or datasets. The most common fails derive from
an incorrect date insertion, since any implemented satellite has a diﬀerent temporal
range to consider. Hence, the user should already be informed about the properties
of the considered satellites. Particularly, the necessary starting date limit have been
pointed out in the GUI, while the limited ending date obviously changes as function of
the satellite. Further error indications have been conﬁgured for other common insertion
mistakes and network connection failures.

3.2. Core of the Code

The core of the code is the Bethe-Bloch’s equation, which returns the value of the
stopping power for particles with particular energy inside a prior-deﬁned medium. The
stopping power S is an useful physical quantity since heavy charged particles normally
travel along straight lines within a medium, releasing great amounts of energy in a very
short path, due to their great mass and charge.
The Bethe-Bloch’s equation is the following

The mean excitation potential I is computed according to the model suggested by

Sternheimer et al. (1984), who charted these values for several elements.

When the incoming charged particles have high energies, the electric ﬁeld associated
γ term inside the
to them also increases, which inﬂuences the stopping power (the β
logarithm would increase). Indeed, real media are already able to limit these eﬀects,
therefore the density eﬀect correction δ has been introduced to correct the stopping
power at high energies (Fermi, 1940). In order to consider this eﬀect we again use the
model suggested by Sternheimer et al. (1984).

·

Conversely, the shell correction C corrects the error of the equation associated to
low energies. The model used here is shown and explained in Barkas and Berger (1964).
Finally, notice that inside equation 1 there are terms related to the target material,
such as A, Z, ρ and I, and terms related to the incident particle properties, such as z
and, indirectly, M. The unit of the stopping power is M eV/cm, whether the mass density
of the medium is included, or M eV cm2/g whether one wants to remove the dependence
of the target’s mass density from the computation.

To illustrate the performance of the Bethe-Bloch approach, Figure 6 shows the
stopping power variation as function of energy for incoming protons in diﬀerent media.
The minimum cut-oﬀ energy is 0.511 MeV, which is the value normally associated to
electron bound energy. Results obtained from equation 1 have been compared with those
obtained from other availale tools both in literature and on-line, such as Nucleonica
(Nucleonica website, http://www.nucleonica.com), the ASTAR-PSTAR of the NIST
databank (NIST, ASTAR-PSTAR website, http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/star) and
SRIM (Ziegler, 2003; Ziegler et al., 2010). Results are shown in table 2. Clearly, while
approximated, the approach is suﬃciently accurate for a ﬁrst order real time assessment.

The code allows the user to assess two diﬀerent doses: the eﬀective dose and the ambient
dose equivalent.

3.3.1. Eﬀective Dose Assessment After evaluating the ﬂuence of particles able to cross
the shields conﬁgured, it is possible to obtain the eﬀective dose by multiplying the
ﬂuence by speciﬁc coeﬃcients. These coeﬃcients, usually called ﬂuence-to-eﬀective-
dose-coeﬃcients, directly derive from experimental and accurate simulation campaigns
aimed to evaluate doses on human tissues inside speciﬁc radiation environments. They
are normally looked up as function of energy and particles ﬂuence, with the chance to
interpolate when values do not match. Many coeﬃcients can be found in literature,
but the code considers those published in Sato et al. (2009, 2010); Petoussi-Henss et al.
(2010).

Beside the computation speed, this solution turns out particularly reliable thanks to
the wide studies devoted to compute these coeﬃcients, which are continuously updated
and published in the oﬃcial radio-protection reports (Petoussi-Henss et al., 2010).

3.3.2. Ambient Dose Equivalent Assessment The user can also decide to evaluate the
ambient dose equivalent Ha.

Table 3. Comparison between two diﬀerent period results: upper table summarizes
doses when no solar event has been recorded, whilst table below when solar event is
occurred.

According to its deﬁnition, the code runs a further computation by following the
particles inside a preﬁxed compound recalling the ICRU-sphere, as long as they achieve
the 10 mm depth inside the sphere. The computed energy release is, ﬁnally, multiplied
by the proper factors pointed out in table 1 to assess the ambient dose equivalent.

However, a computation of this kind would take more computational time than for

the case of the eﬀective dose assessment.

4. Results and Discussion

To validate and verify the tool, DREADCode was tested in several scenarios and
compared with established tools available online. In this section, some results are shown.
Since DREADCode is a generic code to evaluate doses during interplanetary travels, we
decided not to follow any strictly mission schedule and test it for some diﬀerent periods.
First of all, we are interested to compare results between a period during which
a solar event has been recorded and a period during which solar events did not occur.
Table 3 compares these situations for the period February 1 - 8 (when no events were
recorded) and period March 6 - 13 (when a solar event was recorded). These periods
have been selected according to the solar event list provided by NOAA (NOAA website,
a).

Values obtained from GOES satellites seem to be coherent with the situation,
since these satellites carry onboard devices able to record both H + and α high energy
particles, even when solar events occur (NASA GOES Fact Sheet). Unlike GOES, the
ACE satellite turns out to be suitable to record only GCR and high atomic number
energetic particles, as well as solar wind. In fact, the most important device for our
28, i.e.
purpose is the CRIS instrument, which measures nucleons ranging 3
galactic cosmic rays. This device, however, does not properly cover periods of high solar
activity, as it is usually switched oﬀ during solar events to prevent from damaging. This
is the main reason why results from ACE shows to be greater in the period February 1
- 8 than between March 6 - 13.

Table 4. Comparison of results from SPENVIS, DREADCode and SEPEM.

Comparing the results from the Nymmik’s model with those from ACE, it is possible
to notice an agreement in the ambient dose equivalent. This model is directly function of
the IMF strength, which in turn is function of the monthly sunspots number and the solar
activity. The number of the sunspots is directly provided by the Solar Inﬂuences Data
Analysis Center (SIDC) of the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB) (NOAA website,
b). This explains why the results are not inﬂuenced by the occurrence of solar events.
On the other hand, a slight variation is noticed and explained with the diﬀerent solar
activity in the two periods. As we expect, the second period, during which a solar event
was recorded, shows a nearly ten times higher dose value than the case considering the
GOES satellites.

We have ﬁnally compared DREADCode with similar tools already available online

(namely SPENVIS website, http://www.spenvis.oma.be and SEPEM website, http://dev.sepem.oma.be)
considering a mission to Mars according to the generic schedule pointed out in
Horneck et al. (2003b). Given the diﬀerences between the tools, assessment conditions
have been kept nearly as congruent as possible, even though some approximation to
match these diﬀerences had to be done. Results are shown in table 4. We notice that
the eﬀective doses show to be closely in agreement between all the tools. Regarding
the ambient dose equivalent, however, DREADCode appears to have a much more con-
servative approach than SPENVIS. SEPEM does not provide the assessment of this
quantity. The two computing methods are radically diﬀerent. While DREADCode runs
once again the same transport method into a preﬁxed layer resembling the ICRU-sphere,
SPENVIS instead makes use of suited coeﬃcients similar to those used to compute the
eﬀective dose. Despite the results have the same order of magnitude, DREADCode
seems to give a more conservative outcome.

5. Conclusions and Future Directions

In conclusion, we presented the DREADCode, a handy tool to macroscopically assess
the radiation doses on human tissues in a relatively short time, which considers a
more realistic description of the existing radiation ﬁeld by directly using satellites data.
Conversely, similar and more advanced tools available to date only consider a generic
view of the incoming radiation through statistical worst-case scenarios or semi-analytical

Web-based description of the space radiation environment using the Bethe-Bloch model16

models, which often turn out to be too generic and unrealistic. Instead, we believed that
a signiﬁcantly improvement of this kind of assessment could be reached by exploiting
the wide ﬂeet of satellites currently at disposal. Moreover, unlike the statistical models
based on the past worst-case events which only consider protons, in DREADCode the
dose from heavy nucleii is also taken into account.

Also, being directly connected with satellites allows us to consider an almost real

time situation, with the only delay due to the data time-processing.

Parameter insertion is fast, easy and intuitive via a GUI, and the computational
costs are relatively low when compared to more precise and accurate computations, such
as those related to Monte Carlo simulations.

Finally, the DREADCode is meant to introduce the basic concept in a modern
web-based frame. DREADCode is not intended to address proper engineering shield
design, given its high conservative approach. The main goal here in fact is to ﬁgure out
what kind of particles is actually able to cross the shield conﬁgured by the user. No
intention was given to the shield design itself.
Its generic proﬁle, however, allows the
code to be used to assess the radiation shielding capacity for many general purposes,
including spacecraft, spacesuit and outpost shielding ability.

DREADCode is highly modular and ﬂexible, allowing for further spin oﬀ
educational endeavours that can upgrade the code. The following examples can be
taken into consideration:

Implementation of new satellite’s datasets or new particles data sources

•

It could be interesting to implement new and diﬀerent particle data sources, in order
to improve the computation reliability on the long period, since satellites have limited
life-time, comparable to few years, as well as to give more options to external users,
such as diﬀerent data sources.

Inserting new coeﬃcients for speciﬁc organs or tissues

•

So far, only the whole body exposure has been taken into account. Nevertheless, the
user could want to compute doses for speciﬁc organs, including the most problematic
tissues. For this purpose, the literature oﬀers speciﬁc coeﬃcients, such as those
suggested by Petoussi-Henss et al. (2010); Sato et al. (2010, 2009); Copeland et al.
(2010); Ferrari et al. (1997).

Considering secondary radiations

•

The physics can also be complicated at will. When charged particles interact
with the medium, they can also generate secondary radiations,
including electrons
and neutrons. While electrons are normally not a big concern, neutrons may reveal
themselves problematic due to their high peak ﬂuxes. This phenomenon turns out
to be more important when energetic particles from space interact with the regolith
of planetary surfaces, by increasing the neutron ﬂux below the crust, whose magnitude
should be considered when long-permanence outposts are planned to be built underneath
the surface.

Additionally, the tool presents itself as an useful educational tool connecting several

problematic aspects typical of the interplanetary journeys.

We started addressing the idea of developing this tool after some experience
acquired in covering the lectures on space weather recently proposed at KULeuven
for undergraduate students. This broad subject shows to be highly multi-disciplinary,
including knowledge on astrophysics, material engineering and radioprotection. While
traditional
lectures dealing with established terrestrial applications can count on
signiﬁcantly helpful hand-on sessions, courses on space weather rarely allows students
to get in touch with the daily practical issues faced by technicians in this ﬁeld.

In particular, we noticed the absence of a direct interconnection between the
theoretical and observational approach on the study of astrophysical events and the
eﬀective causes led by them on the human environment, with a particular gap noticed
in the ﬁeld of radioprotection in space. The latter is thought to be mainly caused by the
absence of manned space missions over the last decades, which brought the education
to heading diﬀerent directions, such as the impact of radiation on human technologies
instead of biological materials. DREADCode has therefore been devised to ﬁll this
educational gap.

By using of the Bethe-Bloch’s equation, undergraduate students additionally learn
more about the radiation-matter interaction with highly energetic charged particles, as
well as the diﬃculty to ﬁnd the proper materials able to suitable shielding the radiation
without increasing masses and costs. Moreover, they are going to tackle the high
uncertainty in setting realistically the target conditions, given the wide variability of
the possible scenarios during such long missions.

Finally, students become familiar with the elevated order of magnitude of dose
reached in space, which are very rarely met in terrestrial conditions, and the latter surely
in accidental situations. These values pose further issues in evaluating the macroscopic
biological eﬀects on human tissues. In fact, whether the typical concerns of terrestial
radiation ﬁelds are mainly focused on long-term low-doses cancer-risk expositions,
radiations in space bring out a new synergistic combination of constant low-level doses
from GCRs and sudden acute exposures in case of solar events, leading to a multi-scale
phenomenon rarely found in terrestrial applications.
