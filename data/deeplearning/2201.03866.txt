ABSTRACT Deep learning (DL) has proven its unprecedented success in diverse ﬁelds such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition by its strong representation ability and ease
of computation. As we move forward to a thoroughly intelligent society with 6G wireless networks, new
applications and use cases have been emerging with stringent requirements for next-generation wireless
communications. Therefore, recent studies have focused on the potential of DL approaches in satisfying
these rigorous needs and overcoming the deﬁciencies of existing model-based techniques. The main
objective of this article is to unveil the state-of-the-art advancements in the ﬁeld of DL-based physical
layer methods to pave the way for fascinating applications of 6G. In particular, we have focused our
attention on four promising physical layer concepts foreseen to dominate next-generation communications,
namely massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, sophisticated multi-carrier waveform designs,
reconﬁgurable intelligent surface-empowered communications, and physical layer security. We examine
up-to-date developments in DL-based techniques, provide comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, and
introduce a comprehensive guide for future directions. We also present an overview of the underlying
concepts of DL, along with the theoretical background of well-known DL techniques. Furthermore, this
article provides programming examples for a number of DL techniques and the implementation of a DL-
based multiple-input multiple-output by sharing user-friendly code snippets, which might be useful for
interested readers.

I. Introduction

S TARTING with the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership

Project) Release-15 standard in March 2017, the brand
new 5th generation (5G) wireless communication technology
has made signiﬁcant progress worldwide [1], [2]. 3GPP
completed the Release-17 Stage-2 freeze in June 2021 and
is planning the next freeze in March 2022 [3]. As these
releases have been proceeding, the deployment process of

5G has attained a high level of maturity. According to a
recent GSA report, 176 operators from 72 countries had
launched commercial 5G networks as of August 2021 [4].
However, the recent advancements in the implementation
of 5G have exposed the drawbacks and limitations of this
technology despite being nominated as the primary enabler
of Internet-of-Everything (IoE) systems [5]. Even though 5G
has introduced more ﬂexibility and efﬁciency to wireless net-
works by utilizing new technologies such as millimeter-wave

on the way toward these 6G technologies in the literature
have also been comprehensively reviewed and discussed by
some other research groups [9]–[11].

intelligence (AI),

The stringent demands of 6G have driven researchers
to look for sophisticated physical layer (PHY) techniques.
Beyond using more spectrum in upper 100 GHz bands,
such as high-frequency mmWave and terahertz bands, 6G
incorporate numerous emerging technologies such
might
as scalable artiﬁcial
index modulation
(IM) [12], [13], cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) systems [14], [15], reconﬁgurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) [6], [16], [17], PHY security [18], [19],
advanced waveforms [20], [21], satellite and non-terrestrial
networks [22], [23], and wireless power transfer [24], [5],
as shown in Fig. 3. Even though all these technologies will
signiﬁcantly impact 6G, AI might be the leading innovator
of 6G networks, supporting a completely new outlook for
wireless networks, particularly in the PHY.

The aforementioned current technologies optimize several
network functions by using model-based techniques that
provide characteristics of the policy involved. These tech-
niques, yet, can be too sophisticated to be implemented
physically in terms of run time, or they might contain
too much abstraction to work in a broad environment.
Conversely, AI-based solutions may adjust to dynamically
changing scenarios and localized characteristics by absorbing
knowledge of the target communication environment. AI can
be implemented in a highly conﬁgurable infrastructure with
a wide range of network ﬂexibility. AI has the ability to
forecast certain limits and handle vast amounts of data so that
AI-integrated 6G will assist in processing the ﬁnal volume
of metadata with less resources and computational burden.

FIGURE 1. Emerging applications of 6G wireless networks.

(mmWave) communication and multi-numerology orthogo-
nal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the pledged
revolutionary mobile communication perspective has re-
mained a pipe dream thus far [5], [6]. Moreover, although
5G systems are ready to support data rate-hungry enhanced
mobile broadband services and ultra-reliable low-latency
communications, it is questionable whether they can sup-
port future IoE applications [6]. Therefore, researchers have
been investigating sophisticated communication technologies
and developing intriguing concepts for 6th generation (6G)
wireless networks, which are projected to come into life after
2030. Even if cellular communication systems have advanced
to a new level with the development of 5G, expectations of
the intelligent information society of 2030 and beyond will
be remarkably compelling. 6G will be the essential provider
of a highly digital community by connecting everything,
enabling almost unlimited wireless coverage, establishing
full-vertical networks, and supporting holographic and high-
precision communications for tactile and haptic applica-
tions [7]. In addition, new IoE services ranging from ex-
tended reality applications and ﬂying vehicles to space travel
and brain-computer interfaces will come to reality with 6G
networks, making 6G the true master of IoE [5], as illustrated
in Fig. 1. However, these new and fascinating applications
will bring strict and very challenging requirements such as
ultra-high reliability, low latency, substantially high data rate,
high energy and spectral efﬁciency, and dense connectivity.

approximately 1940s when neural networks (NN) ﬁrst ap-
peared in intelligent systems. Machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) approaches have been proven to be
competitive frameworks over the years for challenging tasks
language
such as computer vision, robotics, and natural
processing, in which building a concrete mathematical model
is relatively difﬁcult. For example, although it is almost
mission impossible to develop an analytical model or robust
algorithm for detecting handwritten digits (digit recognition)
or different objects in an image (image segmentation), DL
techniques can accomplish these tasks with a performance
exceeding human level. On the other hand, communication
technologies hinge on numerous mathematical models and
theories requiring expert knowledge, such as information
theory and channel modeling. Information signals stream
from optimal transmitter designs with modulation, coding,
and signaling schemes over a range of mathematically
deﬁned channel models to be reliably detected at the re-
ceiver, in which each block is optimized individually. In
addition to this well-deﬁned PHY architecture, the ability
of secure transmission along with eliminating various hard-
ware imperfections makes communications a complicated
and mature ﬁeld. Therefore, ML and DL techniques must
reach lofty goals to outperform existing technologies and
provide discernable advantages. Applying DL approaches
to optimize the building blocks separately, ranging from
modulation and coding schemes (MCS) to symbol detec-
tion and channel estimation algorithms, would not produce
much of a change [25]. End-to-end (E2E) optimization of
communication systems as a whole in complex scenarios,
such as unknown channel models and ultra-high mobility
conditions, is the most fascinating concept that we expect to
see in 6G, and we call this PHY revolution. Switching from
the block structure of current PHY communications, where
each block is responsible for a different signal processing
task, to E2E optimization using DL methods represents a
radical paradigm shift that will entirely transform 6G and
beyond wireless communications.

Researchers have been studying the use of ML and DL
techniques to overcome the drawbacks of current systems,
particularly in the past couple of years. However, despite
being exceptionally promising, DL methods experience some
difﬁculties that restrict their viability in challenging com-
munication scenarios. The highly-parameterized architecture
of deep NNs (DNNs) necessitates massive datasets to learn
an appropriate mapping from features to desired outcomes,
which increases the computing complexity and complicates
the training process. Thus, utilizing solely data-based DNNs
as a black box and leaving all predictions to model weights
is questionable, at least for now, since datasets regarding
communications have not reached a satisfactory level yet.
Due to the limits of model-based and data-based meth-
ods, model-driven DNNs have emerged, which combine
DNNs’ powerful learning and mapping abilities with ex-

the 6G era.

pert knowledge to get the most potential advantage. The
two most common model-driven DNN strategies are deep
unfolded networks, where DNN layers replicate iterations of
an existing iterative algorithm, and hybrid networks, where
DNNs help conventional models and enhance efﬁciency [26].
As the DL literature on communication technologies has
progressed, the data scarcity problem has also become a
thing of the past, paving the way for entirely data-based DL
systems.

A. Contributions
In this comprehensive survey article, we investigate DL
applications from the perspective of four prominent and
innovative 6G concepts in the PHY,
including massive
MIMO systems, advanced multicarrier (MC) waveforms,
RIS-empowered systems, and PHY security, as illustrated
in Fig. 4. We thoroughly present the overview of the up-to-
date literature on DL for PHY design, reveal the progress
made so far, and compare the considered models in terms of
their key characteristics. Moreover, considering the limited
coverage of and overwhelming need for the implementation
and programming steps of DL concepts in the literature, we
exhibit example implementations by providing simple code
snippets to enlighten readers interested in this ﬁeld. In this
regard, we also hope that our article might be helpful for
wireless researchers who want to have hands-on experience
on DL-based wireless system design. To our knowledge, this
is the only survey in the literature that focuses on 6G from
the perspective of PHY architectures and presents a complete
guideline to PHY researchers.

In particular, we ﬁrst shed light on DL approaches that ad-
dress the challenges in massive MIMO detection and channel
estimation in order to overcome the drawbacks of traditional
methodologies. Combining DL-based detection and channel
estimation schemes, we present entirely intelligent large-

scale MIMO receiver frameworks. Furthermore, we analyze
how to replace the conventional signal processing blocks in
a classical massive MIMO transmitter with DL structures to
provide optimal transmission schemes with low complexity.
Our long-term objective for intelligent massive MIMO sys-
tems is to integrate DL-based transmitters and receivers to
develop innovative E2E communication systems even in un-
known channel models. As a glaring enhancement for MIMO
systems, IM techniques have attracted huge interest recently.
Therefore, we also examine how to improve the efﬁciency of
the existing IM techniques and present DL-empowered IM
2.0 solutions. We also provide an implementation example
for a DL-based IM system with simpliﬁed code snippets to
guide interested readers on programming a DL-based MIMO
system in Python.

For MC communication systems, we primarily focus on
the DL-based transceiver design to improve various perfor-
mance metrics. In most studies, NNs have been designed
to be implemented in the receiver side of various MC
communication systems with the purpose of outperforming
conventional algorithms. Data-driven DL-based receiver de-
signs are introduced to perform channel estimation and signal
detection tasks. Furthermore, by using expert knowledge,
model-driven NNs have been presented to further improve
the performance and decrease the computational complexity.
Recent studies have focused on transceiver designs opti-
mizing the transmitter and receiver pipeline as a whole by
beneﬁting from the E2E approach, which is put forward as a
promising direction. Moreover, an extensive literature review
is provided to amend the weaknesses of OFDM, which is
by far the most popular waveform in current standards.
Particularly, DL techniques utilizing deep unfolding stand
out as promising solutions to combat major problems of
OFDM.

On the side of RIS-assisted communication systems, we
investigate DL-based studies that present novel frameworks
to overcome the existing drawbacks of earlier RIS-based
systems. We primarily introduce DL approaches constituting
intelligent channel estimation and signal detection processes.
We conclude that employment of DL approaches requires
less pilots and training overhead than conventional tech-
niques. Furthermore, we focus on emerging DL-based NNs
eliminating model dependency for phase conﬁguration in
RIS-assisted schemes. The presented passive beamforming
designs prove that DL-based processes, which unveil a direct
mapping between phase shifts and received signal strength,
provide robustness in different channel environments with
reduced computational complexity. We also review the recent
studies that present standalone operations employing fully
passive elements to suit the passive nature of RISs and reduce
the training overhead. Besides, due to the growing interest in
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) solutions for next-
generation communication systems, we examine DL-based
systems improving clustering and power allocation perfor-
mance of RIS-assisted NOMA designs. Thereby, we discuss
that the utilization of DL approaches provides enhanced
ﬂexibility and robust performance under dynamic states and
the number of users compared to traditional methodologies.
Finally, we focus on DL-assisted PHY security approaches
and investigate the existing studies in the literature. DL
is implemented to PHY security schemes from three main
perspectives based on the attack type: spooﬁng, jamming,
and eavesdropping. Against spoofers, DL is mostly used at
receivers to improve authentication accuracy. Especially, DL
improves the legitimate/illegitimate classiﬁcation problem
of the authentication test and brings robustness against
unknown and varying environments. DL is also implemented
for anti-jamming purposes. However, most of the anti-
jamming methods employ reinforcement learning to avoid

Finally, we
conclude the article with Section VII by providing our future
perspectives.

II. An Overview of DL Techniques
In this section, we will discuss the general structure of DL
models and explain the training procedures of NNs to pro-
vide a quick overview of DL techniques. We will emphasize
fundamental concepts and parameters that form DL models
to facilitate understanding of proposed methods in the liter-
ature. We will also dig into the details of commonly used
DL techniques, namely DNN, convolutional NNs (CNN),
and recurrent NNs (RNN), by providing their theoretical
background and motivations. In addition, we will discuss the
applications of each technique in wireless networks. We will
conclude this section with an image classiﬁcation task using
a simple CNN architecture and the well-known CIFAR10
dataset [27], [28].

A. DL Architecture at a Glance
DL is a sub-branch of ML, with multiple stacked pro-
that enable predictions, classiﬁcations, or
cessing layers,
other decisions by learning data representations. Given raw
data,
to classical ML methods that strongly
depend on domain-expert features, DL models generate non-
linear input-output mappings to execute actions on a goal
objective. Fig. 6 illustrates the relationship between DL,
ML, and AI. Each layer in an NN architecture transforms a
representation to a higher level, where each transformation
unlocks the learning of a more sophisticated characteristic
of raw data. A model may be shallow or deep depending on
the number of layers, the depth of an NN, imitating either
a simplistic or complicated function of raw input data by
being sensitive to vital features and insensitive to irrelevant
changes such as environment or nearby objects. Aside from
the input and output layers, each layer is a hidden layer
consisting of hidden units known as neurons. During the
representation learning process, hidden neurons in a layer
calculate a weighted sum of their preceding layer’s inputs
and transfer the result to the next layer through a non-
linear activation function, corresponding to one iteration of
forward-propagation. Starting with the input layer, which
passes the weighted sum of raw input data to the ﬁrst hidden
layer, each hidden layer handles its computation. In the
end, the output layer produces the desired outcomes, which
might be probabilities, category scores, or any other metric.
DL researchers have identiﬁed several activation functions
to introduce a non-linearity effect into forward-propagation,
such as the rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU), leaky ReLU, tanh,
sigmoid, and more. The most popular one is the ReLU
function and deﬁned as f (a) = max(a, 0) [29], [30].

When an NN completes a forward-propagation iteration,
the algorithm computes a loss function by comparing the out-
put scores with desired labels. This loss function represents a
model error, which is subsequently utilized to update internal

jammed frequencies and apply DL for the purpose of better
Q-functions approximation. Moreover, various secure com-
munication systems implemented DL algorithms in their
system models to improve the secrecy rate against eavesdrop-
pers. Particularly, we reveal that these studies employ data-
driven models to generate coding or beamforming schemes
which minimize the leaked information to eavesdropper.

B. Organization
The organization of this article is given in Fig. 5. In Section
II, we brieﬂy discuss the structure of DL and introduce
basic DL techniques from both theoretical and programming
perspectives. We begin our extensive literature review with
emerging MIMO technologies in Section III and provide
an implementation example for a DL-based MIMO system
model. Section IV presents DL solutions for sophisticated
MC waveforms. In Section V, we delve into DL-aided RIS
communication systems. We discuss how DL methods can

bias by comparing training error with zero error. Indeed, the
Bayes error, the known optimal value that can be human-
level performance or other values, should be the benchmark
for bias, which is not necessarily zero.

We have provided a brief introduction to DL structures

and training procedures,

will go over the theoretical background of three frequently
used DL architectures: DNN, CNN, and RNN, and present
the implementation of a simple image classiﬁcation task.

including insights of

B. Theoretical Foundations of DL
We will begin by analyzing DNNs, which are by far the
most common DL structures used in DL applications. A
DNN consists of multiple stacked layers, with each neuron
connected to all neurons in the preceding and the following
layers creating a fully connected structure. The number of
neurons in the input and output layers equals the number
of features in the raw input data and the number of cate-
gories, classes, or other targets according to the application,
respectively. Fig. 8(a) depicts the architecture of a DNN
with two hidden layers and three classes. Each link between
two neurons represents a real-valued weight that forms the
basis of the learning mechanism. It is critical to carefully
initialize model weights to optimize learning performance
and avoid vanishing or exploding gradients. A widespread
initialization method is the random generation of weight
matrices with uniform or Gaussian distributed elements.
Another popular approach is Xavier initialization [36], de-
veloped by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio, in which
randomly generated weights between layers [l − 1] and [l]
(cid:112)2/(n[l−1] + n[l]), where n[l] is the number
are scaled by
of neurons in the lth layer. The forward-propagation of the
DNN given in Fig. 8(a) for a single instance is given as
follows:

Hidden-1: z[1] = W[1]x + b[1],
Hidden-2: z[2] = W[2]a[1] + b[2],
Output: z[3] = W[3]a[2] + b[3],

a[1] = g[1](z[1]),

a[2] = g[2](z[2]),
ˆy = g[3](z[3]).

(1)

In (1), x and ˆy represent (4 × 1)-dimensional raw input
data and (3×1)-dimensional class scores, respectively, while
W[l], b[l], z[l], g[l], and a[l] correspond to (n[l] × n[l−1])-
dimensional weight matrix, (n[l] × 1)-dimensional bias vec-

parameters, also known as model weights. The update of
these adjustable weights corresponds to the training of the

derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight
to observe the amount of resultant error when weight was
increased or decreased. In the opposite direction of forward-
propagation, the algorithm computes weight gradients using
the chain rule [31], which obtains derivatives going back-
ward, called backpropagation. DL model updates its weights
by changing them in the reverse direction of calculated gradi-
ents to decrease the error value after backpropagation [29].
The update rule is one of the most critical aspects of DL
applications since it highly impacts overall learning perfor-
mance and training time. Thus, researchers have developed
different optimizers, including momentum [32], root mean
square propagation, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) [33],
adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) [34], and many more.
Recently, Facebook Research has published a new update
algorithm, called MADGRAD [35], and the DL world is
debating whether this new technique can replace the ADAM
optimizer. Fig. 7 demonstrates a single run of a training
procedure including forward-propagation, loss calculation,
and backpropagation for a single hidden layer DNN, where
the given variables will be deﬁned shortly. A typical DL
model
takes hundreds of millions of these iterations to
ensure that the model observes a good deal of instances
and that the model error converges to a reasonable value
depending on the application. A testing procedure follows
training to examine whether the model can generalize to
unseen occurrences, also known as the compositionality of
DL models. The difference between training and test loss
values represents model variance and indicates that the model
is overﬁtting, in which DL model memorizes rather than
learning. On the other hand, the difference between training
and the Bayes error values corresponds to model bias and
reveals that the model is underﬁtting, which necessitates

tor, (n[l] × 1)-dimensional weighted sum,
the activation
function, and (n[l] × 1)-dimensional layer output of the lth
layer, respectively. The activation function g is non-linear
since using linear activation functions eliminates the effect of
stacking multiple layers and results in the same performance
as the model with a single output layer, as indicated in (2)
where the activation function is g(x) = x:

ˆy = W[3](W[2](W[1]x + b[1]) + b[2]) + b[3]

= ¯Wx + ¯b,

(2)

where ¯W = W[3]W[2]W[1] and ¯b = W[3]W[2]b[1] +
W[3]b[2] + b[3]. As we discussed earlier, ReLU is a suitable
option for hidden layers, while the output layer employs
the softmax activation function, given by (3), to get output
scores:

The ﬁnal stage of the single training pass of the DNN model
performs the update of the model weights and biases. Using
the SGD optimization method, the algorithm updates the
weight matrix and the bias vector of the lth layer by changing
them in the opposite direction of their gradients by their
gradients scaled by a learning constant α:

Here, ˆyi is the score of ith class. Yet, a DL network’s output
layer need not always employ a softmax activation function.
This is dependent on the work that should be handled
using the DL technique, in fact. The addressed problem
that is being handled shapes the selection of the output’s
layer activation function. While any regression problem best
ﬁts with linear activation function, classiﬁcation problems
require different types of activation functions at the output
layer, such as sigmoid and softmax.

When the algorithm obtains the output scores by forward-
propagation, it calculates the loss value depending on these
scores. The loss function might vary according to the ap-
plication, and we will use the categorical cross-entropy loss
function for this classiﬁcation model:

L(y, ˆy) = −

where y is the one-hot vector of the ground truth labels
consisting of all zeros except one in the index of the
correct class. The next step is backpropagation, in which the
gradients are computed by taking the derivative of the loss
function with respect to the weights and biases. (5) provides
the calculation of the gradients of the ﬁrst hidden layer’s

The second well-known DL architecture is CNN, also
known as ConvNets. A CNN architecture presumes simi-
larity between various areas of a 2D feature vector and aims
at capturing correlations between these parts, as shown in
Fig. 8(b) [29], [30], [37]. The ﬁrst key idea underlying the
motivation of the CNN architecture is local connections. In
contrast to DNNs, where each hidden unit links with all
hidden units of the former and latter layers, CNNs connect
a single unit in a convolutional layer to a local patch in the
previous layer. Raw input data of a CNN model consists
of multiple 2D feature vectors corresponding to channels.
For example, a 28 × 28 RGB image comprises three 2D
feature vectors representing the pixels in the RGB color
channels. It is most likely that local regions of an RGB
image are correlated, and statistics are comparable, which
means a pattern appearing in an area might also come out
of another region, such as two ears of a cat in different parts
of an image [29], [37]. Therefore, it is logical to utilize these
spatial relationships and link a patch of input data to a hidden
unit rather than a fully connected structure [37].

The second major characteristic that forms the CNN
baseline is weight sharing. Each local patch in the 2D feature
vector connects to a distinct hidden unit in the following

a single channel; however, they might differ depending on
the model architecture. When there are more channels in the
input data, the 3×3 shared weight spans other channels in the
same way as shown in Fig. 9. The dimensions of the input
and output data may dispute according to window size and
stride value. Therefore, amending a padding layer composed
of all zeros to the input data equalizes the dimensions, if
necessary.

A pooling layer follows the convolutional

layer in a
typical CNN model architecture, which computes a single
statistic, such as the average or the maximum, of the input
patches [37]. Pooling layers enable the CNN model to be-
come robust to minor distortions without requiring additional
learnable parameters [29], [37]. The stride value of a pooling
layer is generally as large as the window size. The initial
stages of a CNN model are typically composed of stacked
convolution, non-linear activation function, and pooling,
followed by further convolutional and dense layers [29].
The loss calculation and backpropagation procedures are the
same as that of DNNs, where the algorithm computes the
gradients of the weights by taking the derivative of the loss
with respect to the weights.

The DL techniques that we have examined so far suffer
from a common shortcoming of being memoryless, where
each layer’s output depends only on its input and the
corresponding weights without considering the past. This
is where RNNs come into play for applications including
sequential data, such as speech recognition and natural
language processing, thanks to their ability to utilize previous
parts. RNNs process an input sequence with correlations
between the elements one sample at a time, and the outputs
just depend on the input and weights but also the
not
past
information, as given in Fig. 8(c) [29], [30], [38].
The architecture of an RNN might vary according to the
application. For example, each layer might yield an output,
like in Fig. 8(c), for a sequence generation application such
as image captioning or a single outcome for a sequence
classiﬁcation such as assessing the sentiment of a product
review if it is positive or negative [38]. For a sequential input
data X, such as a sentence or a speech, a typical RNN’s
hidden layer performs the following forward-propagation:

s(t) = tanh(Wxx(t) + Wss(t−1) + bs),
h(t) = Whs(t) + bh.

(7)

Here, s(t) is the internal state of the model at time t, which
forms the memory unit by containing the information about
the past elements, Wx and Ws are the weights that connect
the tth input sample x(t) and the previous state s(t−1) to the
current state, respectively, bs is the bias of s(t), and bh is the
bias of the layer output h(t). Similar to the weight sharing
procedure in a CNN, the hidden layers of an RNN share the
weights and biases, which prevent overﬁtting and decrease
the model complexity [30].

The training procedure of an RNN resembles that of DNNs
and CNNs, where the RNN model serves as a multi-layer

FIGURE 9. Windowing procedure and the convolution operation of a CNN
model.

convolutional layer, where all links use the same weight
matrix. The motivation behind weight sharing is to decrease
the number of learnable parameters. The example given
in [37] describes this motivation perfectly. Let us assume
that we have 482×415 input data with three channels, where
the input size is 600090. Considering the dense connection
of DNNs, the parameter size is approximately 600K for a
single hidden unit in the next layer, increasing to more than
600M for 1000 hidden units. Many parameters increase the
training time substantially, crack the available memory, and
necessitate powerful regularizers to prevent overﬁtting. On
the other hand, a 40×40 shared weight matrix spanning local
patches provides 4800 learnable parameters, allowing 125
hidden layers with 1000 units each against a single hidden
layer in the dense connection. As a result, the number of
parameters and model size reduce signiﬁcantly along with
the enhancement of the generalization capacity, preventing
memorizing data rather than learning.

The primary operation of CNN forward-propagation is
convolution, which links local regions to hidden units.
Speciﬁcally, a CNN model calculates the weighted sum of a
patch in the 2D feature vector by the convolution operation
to pass the patch’s features to a single hidden unit of the
next layer. A single patch represents the window of the
CNN forward-propagation whose size determines the size
of the shared weight matrix, and CNN travels across all
windows to move on to the following layer. These windows
might, and most probably, intersect, in which the shifting
size corresponds to the stride of the current convolutional
layer. A simple example of this windowing procedure and the
convolution operation is given in Fig. 9. In this example, the
5 × 7 input data X and the 2 × 3 output data Y both include

step, shared weights across these time steps, and single
or multiple outputs according to the application. Following
the loss calculation,
is trained via the
the RNN model
backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, which is
the SGD unfolded in time [30], [38]. However, the BPTT al-
gorithm is challenging since it causes gradient vanishing that
inhibits information delivery or exploding that paralyzes the
training. The reason for this is repeated multiplication with
the weight matrix during the backward pass. Researchers
have suggested several solutions for this problem, such as
initializing weights from a previously trained model, gradient
clipping that prevents gradients from exceeding a threshold,
and sophisticated optimization techniques like ADAM [38].
As a powerful alternative to these solutions, the Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) networks are designed to address
gradient vanishing or exploding issues along with providing
longer memorization than a classical RNN by enhancing the
network with explicit memory. Let us consider a language
model aiming at predicting the upcoming word based on the
formers [39]. RNNs perform well in anticipation when the
gap between relevant information and the prediction point is
narrow:

Unfortunately, RNNs can not ﬁnd the relevant information
as the distance increases, and it is possible for the distance
becomes considerably large. In such cases, it is beneﬁcial to
employ LSTM networks to learn long-term dependencies:

According to our comprehensive research, DNNs are by
far the most popular DL architectures used in the PHY design
of wireless communications. Speciﬁcally, DNNs are utilized
for signal detection, channel estimation, peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR) reduction in MC waveform designs, and
passive beamforming designs in RIS-based systems. CNN-
based models also have an immense role in the literature of
DL-based PHY designs. There are use-cases like modulation
recognition, signal classiﬁcation, removing cyclic preﬁx (CP)
in MC waveform designs, and anti-spooﬁng & anti-jamming
in PHY security schemes. It is also worth mentioning that a
CNN does not have to utulize 2D feature vectors. There are
several studies using 1D CNNs in the literature. Particularly,
the literature in wireless communication widely beneﬁts from
1D CNNs in numerous tasks such as network management,
trafﬁc analysis so on [40], [41], [42].

RNNs ﬁnd a moderate pace in DL-based PHY meth-
ods, with certain applications for MC waveform designs
under high mobility and for anti-eavesdropping PHY secu-
rity schemes. Considering future wireless networks, DNNs,

CNNs, and RNNs have the potential
to be utilized for
modeling multi-attribute mobile data, spatial mobile data
analysis, and temporal data modeling, respectively [30].
Once we understand the theoretical background and major
applications of the most popular DL architectures, we may
now delve into DL programming with Python. Despite pre-
senting an image classiﬁcation application is not the primary
focus of this work, we provide a simple example here to
illustrate the basics of DL programming.

C. Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks
We also elaborate and present the studies pursuing end-to-
end learning schemes in this survey. Since the end-to-end
learning concept shows a signiﬁcant contribution to per-
formance enhancement in wireless communication schemes,
several studies have been published using this still maturing
autoencoder approach. An autoencoder is a kind of neural
network that is trained to pass its input to the output the
same. The network can be divided into two components:

h = f (x),

ˆx = g(h).

(8)

(9)

In (8), f(x) function deﬁnes the encoding process where x is
the input data to be converted to h code. Also, g(h) function
in (9) deﬁnes the decoding process converts this h code to
the output ˆx with the g function. The simple architecture of
an autoencoder is shown in Fig. 10(a). An autoencoder is not
particularly effective if it simply learns the set g(f (x)) = x
all the time. Conversely, autoencoders are made so that they
cannot be perfect at copying. They are typically regulated
so that they can only duplicate input that closely resembles
the training data and only with some degree of accuracy.
The model frequently learns beneﬁcial features of the data
(cid:125)
because it must decide which aspects of the input should
be duplicated. The concept of an encoder and a decoder has
been expanded by modern autoencoders to include stochastic
mappings in addition to deterministic functions.

Through a sequence of effective parametric linear alge-
bra operations, autoencoders in wireless communication, as
shown in Fig. 10(b), enable the physical layer transmitter
and receiver to take the form of essentially unconstrained
mappings. By attempting to reduce BER corresponding
reconstruction loss, deep learning allows us to arrive at a
solution to the whole communications system design chal-
lenge. This approach is capable of being applied over a wide
range of channels and impairment models to provide better-
suited solutions. Tailor-made waveforms may accomplish
innovative and unparagoned performance under challenging
channel conditions by learning physical layer information
(encoder, decoder) and representation solutions in this end-
to-end manner.

A generative adversarial network (GAN) resembles an
inside-out autoencoder in appearance. Yet, unlike autoen-
coders compressing input data, GANs convert their low-
dimensional input into high-dimensional data at the inner

D. Programming for DL: A Simple Classiﬁcation Example
We have analyzed the theoretical foundations of DNNs,
CNNs, and RNNs so far. The programming stage of a
DL application is as important as building the DL-based
system since the feasibility of the considered method requires
thorough examination via extensive computer simulations.
Thus, we will provide the coding stage of a basic CNN
architecture using Python and Keras [43]. We will build a
CNN-based image classiﬁer model with training using the
CIFAR10 dataset [27], [28]. CIFAR10 consists of 60000
(32 × 32) RGB images including 10 categories as given in
Table 1. 50000 images correspond to the training data while
the rest 10000 images construct the test data. We will begin
with calling the necessary modules:

Here, the img to array module converts an image to the

the CIFAR10 dataset, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense, and
Flatten represent the convolutional and pooling layers of
a CNN, dense layer of a DNN, and ﬂattening layer which
squashes its input, respectively. The Sequential module
creates a DL model by adding the layers consecutively. The
Image module is useful to process an image and numpy is
the well-known scientiﬁc computing module. Now, we can
import the CIFAR10 data and preprocess it by normalizing
each pixel to (0-255) range:

network. Using two neural networks in competition with
one another (adversarial), GANs are computational structures
that produce new, artiﬁcial instances of data that can be
misinterpreted for genuine data. They are extensively utilized
in the creation of images, videos, and voices. The neural
network named ”Generator” creates new data instances while
they are authenticated by another neural network named
”Discriminator” as shown in Fig. 11. Each sample of data
that is reviewed by the discriminator is evaluated to deter-
mine if it is a part of the training dataset or not. The primary
distinction between Autoencoders and GANs is the way that
learn. Autoencoders may be thought of as addressing a semi-
supervised learning issue since they aim to reproduce a pic-
ture with the least amount of loss possible. In other respects,
GAN handles problems involving unsupervised learning. The
training period for the two approaches could be treated as
the most signiﬁcant distinction. The required training time
for GAN is longer; nevertheless, autoencoders provide less
credible results (such as decreased image quality). GANs
were thus considered and found to be far more stable.

The ﬁrst ten images in the training data and their labels

preprocessing and manually observing the data, we can now
build the CNN model. We use a simple architecture to keep
the model complexity and training time moderate, which can
be created as follows:

We use sparse categorical crossentropy loss function to
calculate the loss value which performs exactly the same as
the typical categorical cross-entropy loss function given in
(4). However, in this case the ground truth label is a single
digit from 0 to 9 representing the correct label instead of a
one-hot vector. Subsequently, we train our CNN model to
observe train/test loss and accuracy values:

h i s t o r y = model . f i t ( x t r a i n , y t r a i n ,

v a l i d a t i o n s p l i t = 0 . 1 , b a t c h s i z e = 1 2 8 ,
e p o c h s = 5 0 )

FIGURE 13. The loss and accuracy graphs of the train and validation data.

Here, the validation split represents the percentage of
the train data to be utilized as validation data to observe
the loss and accuracy changes of the unseen data during
the training. The batch size is the number of images that
train the model in a single iteration, where a single epoch
is composed of training all batches. The history variable
includes the loss and accuracy values corresponding to the
train and validation data for each epoch, which is shown in
Fig. 13. The graph indicates that the train loss and accuracy
decrease and increase smoothly, where the train accuracy
converges to nearly 97%. Therefore there is almost no bias
and the model does not underﬁt. However, the validation
loss rises after almost the tenth iteration and the validation
accuracy converges to approximately 72%. Thus, there is a
considerable variance and the model strongly overﬁts to the
training data. This can also be observed by evaluating the
trained model on the test data:

p r i n t ( ” Accuracy : %.2 f ”%(a c c u r a c y * 1 0 0 ) )

(cid:29) Accuracy: 71.10

As a result, this model requires a hyperparameter tuning to
improve its generalization ability, which is out of our scope.

their categories:

Here, we ﬁrst import the image and resize it to make it
suitable for our model. Thereafter, we convert the image to
the corresponding 3D pixel array. Since we feed the model
with a train data including 50000 instances, the input of the
model has the dimension of (N, 32, 32, 3). Thus, we reshape
the 3D pixel array to have 1 as the ﬁrst dimension and predict
the class of the image by taking the maximum index of the
output array. Fig. 14 shows the predictions of our model on
four explicit images that the model has never seen before.
The model correctly recognizes the cat and the truck, while
it classiﬁes the given dog and frog as a truck and a ship,
which supports the low validation accuracy in Fig. 13.

We have covered the basics of DL architectures, intro-
duced an overview of the three mostly used DL techniques:
DNN, CNN, and RNN, and provided the programming
stage of an image classiﬁcation task. In the following, we
will begin our investigations of DL applications on PHY
technologies with MIMO systems.

III. DL for Emerging MIMO Systems
Next-generation wireless communication technologies are
expected to bring forth a variety of improvements such as
extremely high data rate and spectral efﬁciency. The brand
new mobile communication technology, 5G, has attracted
the attention of both academic and industrial circles with the
promise of a maximum of 20 Gb/s peak data rate along with
other major improvements in latency and energy/spectrum
efﬁciency. The key enabler of a fully intelligent world, 6G,
will introduce even higher specs such as a peak data rate of
at least 1 Tb/s and a user-experienced data rate of 1 Gb/s [5].
These signiﬁcant improvements are possible with the use of

FIGURE 15. An example massive MU-MIMO scenario with a large antenna
array supporting multiple users.

multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver sides as in
early standards, which is known as the MIMO technology.
MIMO systems can provide spatial diversity gain where the
transmitted symbols are received from multiple paths and the
fading effect is mitigated. Alternatively, spatial multiplexing
gain is obtained by MIMO systems where the capacity of the
channel increases linearly with the minimum of transmit and
receive antennas [44]. Scaling up the conventional MIMO
systems with a few hundred antennas that simultaneously
serve many users, massive multi-user (MU) MIMO tech-
nology has become a breakthrough. Massive MU-MIMO
utilizes all the beneﬁts of the conventional MIMO while
eliminating the MU interference to further enhance the trans-
mission performance, which can be seen in Fig. 15. Massive
MIMO provides 10 times or more capacity compared to the
conventional MIMO via its powerful spatial multiplexing
ability. In addition, it enhances the energy efﬁciency on the
order of 100 times via the ability of sharp beamforming to
the small regions with a large number of antennas [45].

Although massive MIMO technology brings immense
beneﬁts, it comes at some prices. The most shining feature
of massive MIMO, spatial multiplexing, requires reliable
channel state information (CSI). During the downlink trans-
mission of conventional MIMO systems such as in the Long
Term Evolution (4G) standard, the base station (BS) trans-
mits a pilot sequence so that the users estimate the channel
responses and feed them back to the BS. Nevertheless, this
method is not suitable for massive MIMO systems since
each user would have to estimate a few hundred channel
responses which gives rise to a huge feedback overhead.
Another reason is that pilots should be orthogonal between
the antennas and this requires a considerable amount of
orthogonal resources [45]. Another challenge of massive
MIMO technology is the number of required radio frequency
the BS is
(RF) chains. When each transmit antenna at
activated to transmit a different symbol,
the number of
required RF chains equals the number of transmit antennas
and this increases the hardware cost. As a promising solution

shaped constellations that are optimized for the transmission
environments. It is the mission of the intelligent black box
to ﬁnd the best locations for the constellation points and
to optimize the decision boundaries for these points [46].
However, to obtain a performance improvement concerning
the conventional constellation designs, the receiver must be
aware of the decision boundaries of the used complex-shaped
constellations. Therefore, it is mission impossible for the
conventional detectors to decode information bits without the
initial knowledge of the constellation design. This is where
E2E learning appears as one of the remarkably charming
concepts for the next-generation wireless communication
systems, where the aim is to fully optimize both the trans-
mitter and receiver by representing the whole system as an
autoencoder (AE) [47].

DL techniques gleam as a bright solution to those afore-
mentioned drawbacks and further needs of next-generation
massive MU-MIMO systems thanks to their ability to learn a
suitable mapping from input to output. Model-based blocks
of a conventional communication system that depend on opti-
mized mathematical models might be replaced by intelligent
data-based blocks that are robust to dynamic changes of the
transmission environment. The ultimate goal is to achieve
E2E intelligent communication systems, which will, in our
opinion, revolutionize next-generation technology. In Fig. 16,
the applications of DL techniques for MIMO systems are
given from a high-level perspective with a categorization
under transmitter and receiver parts. The following subsec-
tions will shed light on the state-of-the-art research in the
literature of DL applications for MIMO systems as well as
future directions and open issues in this area. Speciﬁcally,
in Subsection III.A, we will demonstrate the use of DL in
detection for MIMO systems. Subsection III.B investigates
DL-based MIMO channel estimation schemes. By combin-
ing DL-aided MIMO detectors and channel estimators, we
discuss intelligent MIMO receivers and introduce the real-
world datasets that might be a benchmark for future studies
in Subsection III.C. Subsection III.D describes the intelligent
MIMO transmitter designs and AEs. DL-based cutting-edge
IM technologies are described in Subsection III.E. Finally,
Subsection III.F demonstrates an example implementation of
a DL-based IM detector for interested readers.

A. Signal Detection for MIMO Systems
The primary motivation behind using DL techniques in
MIMO detectors is to overcome the trade-off between com-
putational complexity and BER performance. The MLD
operates depending on a strong mathematical model and it is
proved that MLD provides the optimum BER performance
under ideal conditions [48], [49]. Since DL techniques, espe-
cially DNNs, are general function approximators, the model
of the MLD can be represented by NNs with signiﬁcantly
low complexity. These approximations are not expected to
outperform MLD. Instead, it is expected to reach the perfor-

MIMO system.

to the inherent problems of MIMO mentioned above, IM
appears as a strong candidate for next-generation wireless
communication technologies. Along with decreasing the
need for the massive number of RF chain requirements, IM
techniques provide high energy and spectral efﬁciency by
conveying additional information bits utilizing the indices of
the building blocks of a communication system [12]. One of
the most critical shortcomings of IM techniques is the detec-
tion complexity. The more bits transmitted via IM, the more
complex the detector becomes. The optimum detector is the
maximum likelihood detector (MLD) and in some cases, it
is impossible to use it because of its unacceptable level of
complexity. At this point, linear detectors, such as zero-
forcing (ZF) and minimum-mean squared error (MMSE)
detectors, take place with the cost of a worse bit error rate
(BER). Thus, there is a trade-off between the complexity
and the BER performance of currently used model-based
detectors.

Preprocessing of transmitting signals, often known as pre-
coding, is another vital topic in efﬁcient massive MU-MIMO
systems. The BS uses precoding before transmission to mit-
igate the fading channel impact and cancel MU interference.
However, precoding techniques that currently exist in the
standards require high-resolution digital-to-analog converters
(DACs) which bring high complexity to the system. There-
fore, the design of precoders with low-resolution DACs is
of interest among the issues of intelligent massive MIMO
transmitter design. Within the context of intelligent MIMO
transmitters, another blooming topic is constellation design
since the performance of communication systems is highly
affected by the shape of the constellation. From their infancy
to the cutting-edge technology, information bits are modu-
lated by a limited number of constellations such as quadra-
ture amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase-shift keying
(PSK). Next-generation intelligent MIMO transmitters are

mance of MLD without requiring the impractical complexity
of MLD. In what follows, we reveal and summarize a brief
overview of the literature in this direction.

The authors of [50] and [51] study a DL-based detector
called DetNet for a MIMO system. The structure of DetNet
is slightly different than a well-known DNN, where it is
designed based on the iterative projected gradient descent
algorithm. The BER performance of the DetNet is com-
pared to the state-of-the-art detectors, approximate message
passing (AMP), and semideﬁnite relaxation (SDRX) under
the assumption of perfect CSI at the receiver. As a similar
approach to [50] and [51], the study in [52] aims to create a
model-driven DL-based detector for a MIMO system based
on the existing iterative detection algorithm, orthogonal
AMP (OAMP). The proposed network, OAMP-Net, wields
some additional trainable parameters to improve the BER
performance of the OAMP detector under perfect CSI.

Another member of model-driven DL-based networks
appears in [53], where the authors combine model-based
and data-based detectors to create a partial learning scheme.
An NN detects a portion of the amplitude-phase modulation
(APM) symbols in a MIMO system as the non-linear data-
based part of the detector. The rest of the APM symbols are
detected by a conventional ZF detector as the linear model-
based part of the detector. This scheme also requires perfect
CSI at the receiver.

In contrast to the former solutions, a pure data-driven
DNN architecture is proposed to detect symbols transmitted
over a multipath fading channel with bandwidth constraints
in [54]. Both ﬂat fading and frequency-selective fading
channels are implemented to analyze the BER performance
of the detector. For a range of pilot overhead percentages
in the transmitted signal, the proposed detector is compared
to the theoretical BER of the Rayleigh fading channel and
the decision feedback equalizer without requiring CSI at the
receiver.

As discussed earlier, DL-based detectors are expected
to decrease the complexity in MIMO system models with
IM techniques. Within this context, data-driven and model-
driven DNNs are investigated in [48] and [49], respectively.
Instead of a single giant DNN, the work in [48] suggests
utilizing data-driven sub-DNNs for the detection process of
a MIMO system with generalized spatial modulation (GSM).
The proposed architecture performs similarly to the MLD
and the single DNN detector with lower complexity under
the assumption that the fading channel is ﬁxed and the noise
is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian.
However, when the noise is correlated or has a deviation in
its distribution, the sub-DNN architecture outperforms the
MLD and the single DNN detector. CSI at the receiver is
not necessary for ﬁxed fading channels, but it is essential
for time-varying channels. On the other hand, in [49], the
authors propose a model-driven DL-based block detector
for GSM inspired by linear block detectors such as Block-
ZF and Block-MMSE detectors. The APM symbol of each

active transmit antenna is detected by a DNN, assuming that
perfect CSI is available at the receiver. The B-DNN model
outperforms the linear detectors and performs similarly to
the MLD with lower complexity.

The treatises examined so far follow the fundamental
principle of DNNs, which is stacking the hidden layers
to build a deep network and to increase the learning abil-
ity. However,
the authors in [55] realize that deepening
the network after a certain number of hidden layers does
not considerably improve the BER performance. Therefore,
they propose a parallel detection network, where several
DL detection networks perform in parallel to introduce a
diversity effect. In order to obtain diversity, a special loss
function is designed. Detection is carried out based on the
perfect knowledge of the CSI. Likewise, in [56], a DL-
based detector composed of many parallel modiﬁed DNNs
introduces a diversity gain in a MIMO system model. The
modiﬁed DNNs employ the residual learning principle and
differ in several ways and introduce diversity to the system.
Assuming perfect CSI, computer simulations unveil that the
proposed detector outperforms the ZF, MMSE, and single
DNN-based detectors.

the receiver. However,

The kind of NN employed in DL-based detectors is
another key factor that draws attention. Within this per-
spective, the work in [57] compares DNN- and CNN-based
detectors to address the issues of robust detection with
imperfect CSI and efﬁcient DL framework for low-complex
detection. This comparison reveals that
the DNN-based
detector performs signiﬁcantly better in terms of the BER
performance. In addition, it outperforms the ZF, MMSE, and
DetNet [50], [51] detectors with both perfect and imperfect
CSI at
the MLD detector has a
considerably better BER performance than the proposed
detector. With a similar approach, DNN-, CNN-, and RNN-
based detectors are designed without channel dependency
and compared to the MLD in [58]. Computer simulations in
this study show that the RNN-based approach performs the
best, whereas the DNN-based approach is the poorest. The
fact that DNN-based architecture outperforms CNN-based
architecture in [57] but degrades in [58] demonstrates that
the optimum DL architecture is dependent on the system
model and environment.

So far,

the suggested detectors have relied on chan-
nel assumptions without considering real-world conditions.
However, according to [59] and [60], the main issue with
the existing DL-based detectors is either unpleasant per-
formance over practical spatially correlated channels or a
computational burden because of retraining for each channel
realization. Thus, the authors of [59] focus on a robust DL-
based MIMO detector that can optimize itself via online
training during the transmission over realistic and spatially
correlated channel models. The proposed detector, called
MMNet, is built upon iterative soft-thresholding algorithms.
Experiments conducted by using a dataset of channel re-
alizations from the 3GPP 3D MIMO channel indicate that

14

VOLUME ,

MMNet outperforms the classical approaches such as AMP
and SDRX, as well as recent DL techniques like Det-
Net [50], [51], and OAMPNet [52], under the assumption
of perfect CSI. The work in [60] introduces an additional
NN, a HyperNetwork, that eliminates the need for online
retraining on top of a modiﬁed version of MMNet to create
the HyperMIMO detector. Computer simulation results re-
veal that the HyperMIMO detector outperforms MMSE and
OAMPNet [52] and performs similarly to the MMNet and
the MLD with less computing cost under the perfect CSI.

The development of DL-based detectors by recreating
mathematical models using DNNs is popular among re-
searchers. [50], [51], and [52] are examples with model-
driven DL architectures. In addition,
the work in [61]
presents a DNN-based detector for massive MIMO systems.
The DNN architecture is model-driven since it depends on
an existing iterative detection method given in [62]. There
are additional parameters to be learned for MU interference
cancellation. The suggested detector outperforms the itera-
tive [62], DetNet [50], [51], and MMSE detectors, assuming
perfect CSI at the receiver. However, there are also data-
driven architectures utilizing the same concept. The authors
of [63] offer a MIMO detector dubbed ViterbiNet that elim-
inates the CSI reliance by integrating DNN architecture into
the Viterbi algorithm. Their simulation results indicate that
the ViterbiNet detector has a superior performance compared
to the conventional Viterbi decoder. Another classical MIMO
detection approach, sphere decoding (SPD), meets with
DNNs in the study of [64]. The proposed method learns the
radius of the decoding hypersphere, outperforming previous
SPD versions and coming close to the MLD with much
less complexity assuming the perfect CSI. The study in [65]
explores the use of DL within tabu search (TS) detection.
Two models are proposed: FS-Net and DL-Aided TS, with
the latter building on the former. Assuming perfect CSI is
available at the receiver, the proposed DL-Aided TS method
decreases complexity by roughly 90% compared to existing
TS algorithms while keeping almost the same performance.
As opposed to the literature inspected thus far, the authors
of [66] consider the MU case and present an NN-based
MU-MIMO detector called RE-MIMO. They are concerned
with resilience against channel misspeciﬁcation, the capacity
to manage a varying number of users, and invariance to
the sequence in which users interact with the system. The
proposed model-driven DL detector depends on the neural
augmentation strategy, which combines the learning proce-
dure with the inductive biases.

We classify the investigated DL-based detectors by ﬁve
key speciﬁcations in Table 2. It should be noted that red
and green hues in the CSI column indicate CSI requirement
and no CSI requirement, while they represent computer
simulations without and with real-world dataset in the Real-
World Dataset column, respectively. There are two notewor-
thy outcomes deduced from Table 2. The ﬁrst is that, to
function as intended, most system models require the perfect

CSI. The second issue is that most DL-based detectors have
never been tested in a real-world setting. In the follow-up, we
will scrutinize the literature of DL-based channel estimators
in MIMO systems.

B. Channel Estimation for MIMO Systems
The fundamental rationale for employing DL methods in
massive MIMO channel estimation is to enable reliable
channel estimation with considerably fewer pilots than the
number of transmit antennas and low-resolution ADCs at the
BS. This leads to a robust detection process with a reasonable
amount of resources for channel estimation.

A DL-based channel estimator for downlink massive
MIMO systems is presented in [67], where the pilot length
is less than the number of transmit antennas at the BS. The
proposed channel estimator consists of two stages, the ﬁrst
of which involves two DNNs working together to perform
pilot design and pilot-aided channel estimation. In the second
stage,
the channel estimation and symbol detection are
implemented iteratively by another DNN to enhance the
performance of the estimation, which is called data-aided
channel estimation. Computer simulations reveal that the
two-stage estimator outperforms the conventional MMSE-
based data-aided channel estimator given in [68]. The authors
of [69] extend this study to uplink MU-MIMO systems.
The recommended channel estimator, unlike [67], skips the
data-aided estimation stage. Separate DNNs design the pilot
signals for the users at the initial part of the pilot-aided
estimation stage. Subsequently, separate DNNs estimate the
channels of the users using successive interference cancel-
lation (SIC). The suggested estimator outperforms both the
traditional MMSE estimator and the DL approach without
SIC. In addition, both [67] and [69] investigates the optimal
pilot length to obtain higher capacity.

Channel estimation in mmWave massive MIMO systems
is complicated since the number of RF chains is limited.
The authors of [70] propose a learned denoising-based AMP
(LDAMP) network to solve this problem. The LDAMP
network is an image recovery network that treats the channel
matrix as a 2D image, with a single pilot for all channels
in the antenna array. The LDAMP network outperforms
the conventional AMP variants. The study in [71] focuses
on DNN-based direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in ad-
dition to DNN-based channel estimation. Speciﬁcally, two
DNN-based algorithms operate DOA and channel estimation
processes without
the need for pilot symbols. Extensive
computer simulations verify that the suggested DOA and
channel estimation algorithms exceed the traditional tech-
niques in terms of mean squared error (MSE) of DOA and
BER performance. Motivated by the drawbacks of [70], the
authors of [72] develop a better denoising network based
on CNNs along with the LDAMP network, resulting in the
fully convolutional denoising AMP algorithm. The required
pilot length is less than the number of channel components
to be estimated. The fully convolutional denoising AMP

algorithm has a successive performance over LDAMP [70]
and other variants of AMP in terms of both normalized
MSE (NMSE) and achievable sum rate. Another channel
estimator built upon the classical learned AMP (LAMP)
method is presented in [73], which is prior-aided Gaussian
mixture LAMP. In the ﬁrst stage of the Gaussian mixture
LAMP algorithm, a new shrinkage function is developed
based on the Gaussian mixture distribution of beamspace
channel elements. Then, the Gaussian mixture LAMP-based
beamspace channel estimation is performed depending on
the derived shrinkage function in the second stage. The
proposed algorithm outperforms the OMP, AMP, and LAMP
algorithms in terms of NMSE. The methods suggested
in [70], [72], and [73] are simulated using the well-known
Saleh-Valenzuela channel model. The study [73] also ran
further computer simulations with the practical ray-tracing
channel dataset provided by [74] and [75].

Along with less pilot-aided channel estimation, DL-based
estimators pave the way for reliable prediction even with
low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In [76],
a massive MIMO BS equipped with mixed-resolution ADCs
implements channel estimation with DNNs. A direct-input
DNN estimates channels using the received signals of all
antennas, whereas a selective-input prediction DNN esti-
mates channels of the antennas with low-resolution ADCs
via received signals of the antennas with high-resolution
ADCs. The proposed algorithm has a superior performance
over the classical MMSE and the expectation-maximization
Gaussian-mixture generalized AMP methods. The idea of
using mixed-resolution ADCs is improved in [77], where
the authors propose an optimization technique for mixed-
resolution ADCs allocation along with the channel esti-
mation and pilot design. Speciﬁcally, the CENet estimates
channels, the SELNet assigns one-bit and high-resolution
ADCs, and the PDNet constructs the pilot matrix. The sug-
gested framework outperforms the conventional generalized
AMP (GAMP) and gridless GAMP in terms of NMSE.
the complete framework is compared with the
Besides,
partial scenarios in which all antennas at
the BS have
one-bit ADCs, and only the CENet exists. Another partial
scheme includes all one-bit ADC antennas with both PDNet
and CENet. The partial design with non-optimized high-
resolution ADCs, PDNet, and CENet performs similarly to
the complete framework.

Using DL methods, it is feasible to reduce ADC resolution
even further, in which accurate channel estimation is possible
despite complete one-bit ADCs. The study in [78] presents
a DNN-based channel estimator for one-bit massive MIMO
systems. The pilot signal is divided into segments in the
ﬁrst stage, where each one forms the input of a DNN.
The estimated channel is the average of all DNNs’ outputs.
Next, detected data symbols using the initial estimation are
interpreted as the remaining pilot signals and utilized to
update the initial channel estimation, similar to the procedure
in [67]. The proposed algorithm surpasses the traditional LS

and Bussgang linear MMSE algorithms in terms of MSE
under both i.i.d. and spatially correlated channels. Similarly,
the work in [79] proposes a DNN-based channel estimator
for one-bit massive MIMO systems. The authors perform
investigations to determine the length and architecture of the
pilot sequence required to ensure that the quantized received
signals are mapped to the channel matrix. According to these
analyses, the more BS antennas, the better the channel esti-
mation performance for the same pilot length. Equivalently,
the more BS antennas, the less required pilot length for
the same channel estimation performance. The suggested
network outclasses the GAMP algorithm under the indoor
massive MIMO channel scenario offered by [74] and [75].
As opposed to the former one-bit channel estimators, [80] in-
troduces a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN)
that can learn an adaptive loss function to optimize the
training procedure and predict the channels. The proposed
conditional GAN algorithm is compared with expectation
maximization Gaussian-mixture GAMP algorithm, two-stage
algorithm [67], LDAMP, channel and DOA estimation algo-
rithm [71], and one-bit channel estimator [78] using the ray-
tracing channel dataset given by [74] and [75]. Computer
simulations reveal that the conditional GAN algorithm has a
more successive performance than the benchmarks in terms
of average NMSE.

Except for [67], all of the channel estimators we have
looked at thus far have only considered uplink scenarios.
However, downlink channel estimation is also crucial
in
terms of reliable symbol detection at the user end. It is
common to assume that the downlink and uplink channels
are reciprocal, and the BS feedbacks the estimated uplink
channels to the users. Nevertheless, the detection perfor-
mance degrades when the channel is not reciprocal. Thus,
the authors of [81] introduce a channel calibration net-
work, called CaliNet, based on DNNs to estimate downlink
channels accurately from the uplink channels when there is
no reciprocality. Computer simulation results indicate that
CaliNet performs better than the Argos method, and similar
to the Cram´er-Rao Bound.

In addition to the prior DL-based channel estimators, the
study in [82] investigates reinforcement learning in channel
estimation of industrial wireless networks. The proposed
algorithm is double deep Q-learning, where the pilot length
equals the number of channel components to be estimated.
The recommended approach beats the estimated MMSE in
an indoor industrial manufacturing setting with 4.7 dB path-
loss, 8.6 dB shadowing, and 29 dB obstacles. However,
the ideal MMSE surpasses the suggested technique in the
same scenario. Similar to how [82] examines a realistic
indoor environment, [83] suggests an RNN-based channel
estimator for massive MIMO systems in the non-line-of-sight
5G Quadriga 2.0 channel model [84], [85]. The algorithm
iteratively searches the channel
taps and denoises their
amplitudes in the time domain. Considering frame error rate,
simulation results for a user speed of 5 km/h show that

the RNN-based iterative channel estimator outperforms the
traditional MMSE technique.

Considering seven key factors, we categorize the reviewed
DL-based channel estimators in Table 3. The red and green
colors in the Pilot Design column represent if pilot design ex-
ists in the study, while they indicate system model with and
without low-resolution ADCs in the last column. FCDAMP,
EM-GM-GAMP, and GM-LAMP represent fully convolu-
tional denoising AMP, expectation maximization Gaussian-
mixture GAMP, and Gaussian-mixture learned AMP, respec-
tively. The most eye-catching observation from Table 3 is
that almost all of the DL-based estimators work for uplink
massive MIMO scenarios. It
is a favorable consequence
that the majority of the approaches fulﬁll the motivation
of using fewer pilots for DL-based channel estimators. It
is also encouraging to note that realistic channel scenarios
are becoming increasingly common, albeit still insufﬁciently
so, within the framework of DL-based channel estimators.
The next subsection combines the DL-based detectors and
channel estimators to build an intelligent receiver framework,
and provides an insight to the real-world datasets.

C. Combined Signal Detection and Channel Estimation &
Real-World Datasets
After examining DL-based detectors and channel estimators,
we can now integrate them in a single algorithm to get a
completely intelligent receiver architecture, which will lead
us to our ultimate objective of E2E intelligent communica-
tion systems. In [86], a single DNN jointly executes channel
estimation and symbol detection for a MIMO-Alamouti
system, a unique case of space-time block codes with two
transmit antennas. The four-layer DNN takes the real and
imaginary parts of the received signal as the input and
generates the probabilities of the possible transmit symbol
combinations, without explicitly estimating the channel. The
recommended network has 1 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
loss compared to MLD detection with perfect CSI and 3 dB
SNR gain compared to MLD detection with imperfect CSI,
at the same BER.

The authors of [87] direct their research towards intelli-
gent receiver for spatial modulation (SM) considering time-
variant dynamic channels. The suggested network, called
DeepSM, consists of two parallel DNNs, with the upper
DNN updating the CSI and the lower one detecting the
transmitted symbols at each time slot. The initial CSI is
computed using the LS technique utilizing a pilot signal with
a length equal to the number of transmit antennas. DeepSM
is compared to the conventional model-based and data-
driven DNN-based receivers over both time-variant and time-
invariant channel models. Both benchmarks implement LS
channel estimation and assume that the channel is invariant
during the whole simulation. Subsequently, the conventional
model-based receiver employs MLD detection, whereas the
data-driven DNN-based receiver detects the transmitted sym-
bols by a DNN. Extensive computer simulations reveal

that DeepSM outperforms the benchmark schemes in all
scenarios. Similar to the iterative architecture of DeepSM,
the work in [88] proposes a model-driven DL-based joint
channel estimation and symbol detection network, OAMP-
Net2, by unfolding the existing iterative algorithm OAMP.
OAMP-Net2 performs initial pilot-based channel estimation
and detects information symbols afterward. Following that,
data-aided channel estimation and symbol detection pro-
cesses take place iteratively. The recommended approach
outperforms the AMP, OAMP, MMSE, MMSE-SIC, Det-
Net [50], [51], and OAMP-Net [52] in different MIMO
setups and modulation orders. MLD and SPD detectors, on
the other hand, outclass OAMP-Net2 with their signiﬁcantly
larger complexity. In addition, OAMP-Net2 is speciﬁcally
compared with OAMP-Net [52] in various MIMO setups
and modulation orders considering both i.i.d. and correlated
channel scenarios, in which OAMP-Net2 beats the prede-
cessor in all situations. Furthermore, the authors examine
OAMP-Net2 under the practical Quadriga 3GPP 3D MIMO
channel model [84], [85].

The authors of [89] propose two DL-based receiver struc-
tures for uplink MU-MIMO systems. The ﬁrst technique,
FullCon, is a data-driven DNN-based algorithm and detects
the information bits by the received signal directly without
explicitly executing channel estimation. MdNet, on the other
hand, separates the channel estimation and symbol detection
phases. DNN-based channel estimation follows the LS esti-
mation in the ﬁrst stage, while the DL-based detector comes
after ZF detection in the second stage. Both receiver algo-
rithms are tested using various MIMO conﬁgurations and
the number of hidden layers and neurons inside the layers.
In addition, they are compared to two conventional receiver
structures ﬁrst of which consists of LS channel estimation
and MMSE detection, while the second one includes LS
channel estimation and projected gradient iterative detection.
According to computer simulation results, both FullCon and
MdNet outperform traditional techniques in 2 × 2 and 4 × 4
MIMO setups. One notable outcome of computer simulations
is that FullCon has superior performance than MdNet in 2×2
MIMO, whereas MdNet takes the lead in 4 × 4 MIMO.

As investigated so far, the literature of DL-based receiver
architectures has grown to maturity. However, to incorporate
them into real-world systems and standards, it is necessary
to examine the feasibility of these designs using real-world
datasets. It is also critical to have a sufﬁciently big dataset to
reproduce the results of existing algorithms in the literature,
create benchmarks, and compare different algorithms based
on universal data [74]. As seen from Tables 2 and 3, the
popularity of practical datasets is not satisfying, which mo-
tivates researchers to focus on generating datasets using real-
world scenarios. In [74] and [75], a generic dataset, dubbed
DeepMIMO, for mmWave and massive MIMO systems is
proposed. The DeepMIMO channels are generated based on
accurate ray-tracing data collected from Remcom Wireless
InSite software [90]. Therefore, this dataset includes the

basic idea underlying E2E communications is to replace
the separate blocks of a MIMO transmitter, channel, and
receiver with a single DL network that can be trained as
an AE to address the conventional block structure’s sub-
optimization issue [25], [94]. As a departure, we will ﬁrst
delve into the details of DL-based constellation design in the
following part.

As previously mentioned, constructing constellations with
the aid of DL networks is an E2E process since the network
must optimize both the positions and decision regions of
the constellation points. The objective is to maximize the
mutual information between the input and output of the
channel, even when the channel model is unknown [46].
The study in [95] provides an AE for designing optimal
constellations and receiver architectures for additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with additive radar in-
terference. The optimization metric is mutual information.
Under various channel model assumptions for different
SNR regimes, several demapping procedures are suggested.
In addition, the proposed network enables using powerful
coding methods such as turbo codes or low-density parity-
check (LDPC) codes. Computer simulations reveal that the
AE-based network outperforms the architectures with the
traditional constellations. The network in [96] conducts
probabilistic shaping to improve the constellations along
with the geometric shaping. The probabilistic shaping op-
timizes the probability of occurrence of the constellation
points. Even when the geometry of the constellation is
ﬁxed, such as QAM, the probabilistic shaping improves the
achievable information rate. This network also maximizes
mutual information using AEs, as in [95]. The proposed joint
shaping method achieves near-capacity performance and out-
performs both non-shaped QAM and just geometric-shaped
QAM across AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. [97]
analyzes AE-based constellation design over a MU interfer-
ence channel to address the dynamic interference problem.
Speciﬁcally, the adaptive DL-based AE network can learn
the degree of interference and enhance BER performance by
adjusting each user’s constellation accordingly. According
to computer simulations, users’ learned constellations are
well-decomposed, and they concentrate on their clusters
in the face of heavy interference. It
therefore, much
easier for the receiver to decode the information in the
strong-interference environment. Furthermore, the AE-based
network performs very similar to the typical uncoded binary
PSK (BPSK) and quadrature PSK (QPSK), with around 2
dB improvement over 8-PSK and 16-QAM.

is,

In contrast to the formers, [98] investigates AE-based
Grassmannian constellation design in non-coherent MIMO
systems, where neither transmitter nor the receiver requires
CSI. Each point on the Grassmann manifold is a unitary
matrix, and the distance between each point pair equals
the chordal Frobenius norm. The recommended method
is compared to Grassmannian constellations designed by
traditional techniques and a non-Grassmannian constellation.

geometry of the surroundings as well as the transmitter
and receiver positions. In addition, the data creation process
is parametric, allowing researchers to ﬁne-tune parameters
based on the desired scenario. Similarly, [91] and [92]
present a parametric and scalable data production frame-
work for vision-aided wireless communications based on
the 3D modeling and ray-tracing provided by [90]. The
objective is the co-existence of visual and wireless data,
with visual data, such as that collected from LiDAR (light
detection and ranging) sensors or cameras, assisting wireless
communication systems that function in the same device or
area. Quadriga, which stands for quasi deterministic radio
channel generator, is a tool for simulating practical MIMO
radio channels for networks such as indoor environments
and satellite communications [84], [85]. As stated in [85],
Quadriga facilitates the creation of channel models given
by entities such as 3GPP. It can also be considered as an
application of the well-known WINNER model with modiﬁ-
cations for satellite communications via its geometry-based
stochastic approach. It extends the terrestrial snapshot-based
simulation system to produce complex-valued baseband time
series. The work in [93] provides a procedure for creating
realistic channel environments for various 5G scenarios
by combining a vehicle trafﬁc simulator and a ray-tracing
simulator. By producing propagation channel data, the goal
is to aid DL-based solutions to challenges linked to the PHY
of mmWave MIMO in 5G. To sum up, the analyzed studies
that propose real-world datasets for MIMO communications
are summarized in Fig. 17. In the next subsection, we will
discuss DL-aided algorithms within the context of smart
MIMO transmitters and E2E communications.

D. Intelligent Transmitter Design and Autoencoders
We analyzed how to optimize individual blocks of a MIMO
receiver separately and jointly in the previous subsections.
Thus, we show that DL networks can learn and optimize
a complete MIMO receiver framework for a range of op-
timization criteria. However, we have yet to achieve our
ultimate goal of communication technology revolution with
fully intelligent frameworks. Therefore, we will investigate
DL approaches that optimize individual blocks of a MIMO
transmitter and eventually learn a whole transmitter frame-
work tuned with the corresponding receiver architecture. The

ceeds all state-of-the-art approaches and attains the highest
diversity order.

Along with intelligent constellation designs that are more
resilient to dynamic propagation environments than the tra-
ditional ﬁxed constellations, DL-based approaches have also
been applied to precoding in massive MIMO transmitters.
The goal is to use DL networks to offer reliable precoding
with low-resolution DACs while substantially decreasing
complexity. The study in [99] investigates a one-bit precoding
design with the optimum constellation design utilizing AEs.
In a multicast massive MU-MIMO system where the BS
broadcasts the information signal to all users, the transmitter
composes a DNN followed by a binary layer to satisfy the
one-bit precoding constraint. Because the gradients of the
binary layer are always zero, implementing the standard
backpropagation approach is complicated. Therefore,
the
authors employ an approximation which is a variant of the
straight-through estimator. Experiments over ﬁxed and vary-
ing channels show that the AE-based one-bit precoding and
constellation design network outperforms the PSK and QAM
transmissions with the conventional one-bit precoder [100].
It is also worth noting that the performance of the AE-based
constellation design with the standard one-bit precoder [100]
is the best, demonstrating the potential of model-driven
DL networks. Likewise, [101] provides AE-based symbol-
level precoding (SLP) and constellation design for unicast
massive MU-MIMO systems in which the BS transmits a
unique information signal to each user. Moreover, the authors
examine robust SLP design for classic QAM constellations
in instances when AE-based constellations are challenging
to execute in reality. According to the numerical results, the
proposed AE-based SLP and constellation design network
outperforms the AE-based SLP with QAM constellation and
non-robust SLP with QAM constellation. Another DL-based
SLP design is provided in [102], where the authors propose
an efﬁcient precoding NN to mitigate MU interference in
an MU-MISO system model. The optimization metric is
the minimum quality-of-service of all users. Simulation
results illustrate that the suggested network has superior
performance than the conventional block-level precoding.
However, the traditional convex optimized SLP scheme beats
the recommended network with considerably greater com-
plexity, indicating that the DL-based SLP network provides
robust performance with signiﬁcantly reduced complexity.
The work in [103] is similar to [99] and [101] in that it offers
an AE-based precoding network for MIMO systems. The
transmitter consists of two DNNs that encode bits to symbols
and precode these symbols with power normalization at
the end. As seen from computer simulations, the AE-based
precoding network surpasses the conventional linear precod-
ing techniques such as ZF and MMSE and the non-linear
Tomlinson-Harashima precoding assuming perfect CSI. The
authors of [104] present a similar separate DNN structure
of [103] in the MIMO transmitter. The ﬁrst of the two DNNs

encodes bits to symbols, while the second does precoding.
The receiver of this AE-based approach includes a radio
transformer network (RTN). The precoding network at the
transmitter and the RTN at the receiver are trained in an E2E
fashion to outclass the classical DL-based MIMO system.
Simulations with different MIMO conﬁgurations reveal that
the proposed combined precoding and RTN architecture
outperforms the traditional linear precoding methods ZF and
MMSE and the DL structures with only precoding or RTN.
The authors also thoroughly analyze the precoding network’s
learned constellations.

The substantial research in [105], [106], and [107] results
in a DL-aided precoding framework for downlink mas-
sive MU-MIMO systems with a uniform planar array at
the BS. The objective of this framework is to implement
precoding that maximizes the ergodic rate while limiting
overall transmit power under a constraint by using both
instantaneous and statistical CSI. The authors, however,
convert this ergodic rate maximization issue to an enhanced
quality-of-service problem to make it
tractable, and the
structure of optimum precoding emerges as a result. Thus,
the proposed structure employs a DNN to successfully
obtain the optimum precoding architecture and to mitigate
complexity problem. Consequently, the proposed framework
reduces complexity signiﬁcantly while maintaining almost
the same performance as the traditional iterative technique.
Furthermore, the authors minimize complexity by splitting
the optimization problem into two sections that evaluate
instantaneous and statistical CSI, respectively. Experiments
with the Quadriga channel model [84], [85] prove that
both general and low-complexity frameworks produce near-
optimal performance with considerably lower complexity
than the classical iterative approach.

The study in [108] proposes another data-driven DNN-
based precoding architecture in which the network fully
learns the input-output relationship of a nearly optimum
precoder to maximize mutual information. Simulation results
show that the suggested network produces almost the same
performance as the optimum precoder with signiﬁcantly
lower complexity than the traditional iterative precoders, just
like in [105], [106], and [107]. The work in [109] takes
a similar approach to [108], in which a data-driven DNN
learns the behavior of an ideal precoder to maximize the
mutual information with considerably reduced complexity.
The suggested DNN accepts vectorized water-ﬁlling precod-
ing matrix as input and yields the optimum one. Concerning
various MIMO setups, simulations indicate that the recom-
mended network achieves the optimum performance while
substantially decreasing the execution time.

Apart from the AE-based and DNN-based precoding
designs discussed so far, model-driven DL-based networks
are also popular within the context of precoding design by
combining the conventional algorithms with DL techniques.
The work in [110] optimizes the conventional non-linear
biconvex 1-bit precoding (C2PO) method by automatically

tuning the algorithm parameters in a massive MU-MIMO
system model. The NN optimized C2PO (NNO-C2PO) un-
folds the iterations of C2PO and utilizes backpropagation to
adjust parameters. Simulations conducted using the Quadriga
channel model [84], [85] illustrate that the proposed NNO-
C2PO algorithm requires about 50% fewer iterations than
C2PO for a similar BER performance. In addition, NNO-
C2PO may employ the same parameters learned for a
given channel model for various channel models with a
moderate performance loss, indicating robustness to dynamic
channel circumstances. In like manner, the study in [111]
unfolds another conventional iterative algorithm named iter-
ative discrete estimation (IDE2) to develop a model-driven
DL network for massive MU-MIMO with ﬁnite-alphabet
precoding. The proposed network, IDE2-Net, precodes the
transmit signals using low-resolution DACs by modifying
the current IDE2 algorithm with conﬁgurable parameters.
Simulations reveal that IDE2-Net has substantially better
performance than the IDE2 algorithm and slightly outper-
forms NNO-C2PO [110] for the same number of iterations.
Following in the footsteps of the formers, the authors unfold
the classical iterative conjugate gradient method for con-
stant envelope precoding in [112]. The suggested network,
CEPNet, optimizes the traditional approach by introducing
trainable parameters to decrease MU interference and com-
putational cost. Simulations show that CEPNet signiﬁcantly
outperforms the conventional algorithm in terms of both
BER and average achievable rate performances with less
complexity. CEPNet is also resistant to channel estimation
errors and channel model mismatch as in [110]. The study
in [113] unfolds the iterative weighted MMSE (WMMSE)
algorithm into a layer-wise structure to maximize the sum
rate. The proposed network embeds trainable parameters
to the WMMSE algorithm to eliminate matrix inversions
and reduce complexity. Unlike previous studies, the authors
develop a CNN-based precoding scheme to compare their
model-driven method to a data-driven network. Extensive
simulation results in a massive MU-MIMO system model
with varying numbers of transmit antennas and users show
the proposed method reaches the sum rate of the
that
WMMSE algorithm and outperforms the CNN-based scheme
with much less complexity. By unfolding, another conven-
tional iterative technique, the alternate direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), is mapped to a DL framework in [114].
The authors provide ADMM-Net for large-scale mmWave
communications in which the DL-based SLP selects the op-
timum subset of RF chains to decrease power consumption.
Simulation results illustrate that ADMM-Net outperforms
conventional ADMM, orthogonal matching pursuit, and co-
ordinated descent algorithms.

Considering a different approach than prior research of
model-driven DL networks that unfold existing iterative
algorithms, [115] presents a DL-based precoding architec-
ture driven by the constructive interference communication
model. The suggested CI-NN model includes a customized

loss function implemented through a customized layer fol-
lowing the output. CI-NN attains the same performance as
the conventional constructive interference model and outper-
forms the linear ZF precoder, as indicated in simulations for a
different number of users. Besides, CI-NN is a user-adaptive
method in which a trained model with a speciﬁc number of
users operates in scenarios with a variable number of users,
which is practical for dynamic environments.

After thoroughly investigating the intelligent massive MU-
MIMO transmitter architectures such as AE-based and DNN-
based complex-shaped constellations and precoding designs,
it is the perfect time to focus on E2E communication systems
in which a single giant DL network substitutes for all
individual blocks. This approach, illustrated by an example
in Fig. 18, can enable E2E optimization
system model
without requiring a mathematical channel model, which is
highly practical since the mathematical deﬁnition of the
channel might be challenging to obtain in some complicated
environments. The main issue with the unknown channel
model is that the conventional backpropagation technique, on
which most of the DL networks rely, necessitates complete
knowledge of the gradients in each layer. When the channel
model is unknown, it is impossible to obtain gradients which
complicates the backpropagation. Researchers in this ﬁeld
have been proposing various solutions to this problem. The
study in [116] presents an optimization technique called
simultaneous perturbation stochastic optimization to approx-
imate channel gradients so that the E2E model becomes
trainable using the standard backpropagation method. The
E2E network with the suggested approximation achieves the
theoretical BER performance in AWGN and Rayleigh fading
channels.

The authors of [47] and [117] introduce a novel aspect to
the unknown gradient challenge in which the E2E network
iterates between the reinforcement learning-based transmitter
training and supervised receiver training. The transmitter

learning problem,
in an reinforcement
learning the environment using the loss function from the
receiver as the reward. On the other hand, the receiver is
trained in a supervised manner to obtain the loss function.
Simulation results indicate that
the proposed alternating
method performs similarly to the E2E supervised DNN
network with a known differentiable channel model. On
top of this alternating training technique, the work in [118]
proposes a reliable feedback system in which the receiver
can convey loss value to the transmitter without assuming
a ﬂawless feedback link. The suggested feedback system
trains both ends of the communication as transmitter and
receiver, removing the necessity for a perfect feedback link.
When the E2E alternating network [47], [117] equipped
with the recommended feedback system is trained in a
noisy feedback environment, it performs almost the same
as the E2E alternating network with perfect feedback link,
as simulations indicate.

the authors of [121] and [122] point out

The studies in [119] and [120] provide a channel-agnostic
E2E network with a conditional GAN modeling the channel
to produce gradients. Using the encoded signals from the
transmitter and the received pilot signals as the conditioning
the conditional GAN generates the channel
information,
model and paves the way through supervised training. Ex-
tensive simulations yield that the suggested network achieves
the performance of an E2E-DNN network with a known
channel model over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.
However,
the
gradient vanishing and overﬁtting issues of the GAN-based
E2E network. They offer a residual-aided GAN that gen-
erates the difference between the transmitted and received
signal. Residual-aided GAN introduces extra gradients to
the network to overcome the gradient vanishing problem.
In addition,
the loss function is modiﬁed by adding a
regularizer to prevent overﬁtting. Simulations using theo-
retical AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels and practical
ray-tracing channel dataset DeepMIMO [74], [75] illustrate
that the proposed residual-aided GAN outperforms the E2E
alternating network [47], [117] and conventional GAN-based
E2E network [119], [120] in all cases.

Instead of a GAN imitating the channel,

the studies
of [123] and [124] suggests a stochastic convolutional layer
for representing channel in an E2E network without pilot
signals. The receiver DNN consists of two DNNs for channel
information extraction and data recovery, with the extracted
channel information merged with the received signal via a bi-
linear production operation used for data recovery. Extensive
simulations in frequency-selective and ﬂat-fading MIMO
channels yield that the recommended approach outperforms
the LS and MMSE channel estimations while trailing the
GAN-based E2E network. In addition, the E2E method is
exceptionally resistant to channel correlations, whereas the
conventional techniques deteriorate even with perfect CSI
knowledge. Another intriguing experiment is wireless image
transmission in which the authors test their E2E network

with the recovered image quality, which performs better than
conventional compression techniques.

E2E networks are easier to use when the channel model
is accessible since channel gradients exist and the network
is trainable in an E2E fashion. The pioneering study in this
area, which is given in [25], analyzes an E2E network for a
given channel model and a loss function. This comprehen-
sive research includes various investigations. First, the AE-
based E2E network is compared against an uncoded BPSK
scheme at several coding rates, with the proposed network
outperforming the latter. To observe expert knowledge in
E2E networks, the authors amend an RTN on top of the
AE-based network, which improves performance. Extending
the AE concept to multiple transmitters and receivers, the
authors examine the performance of an AE-based E2E net-
work in an interference channel. Comparison against a time-
sharing scheme reveals substantial gains. In addition, a CNN-
based DL network yields promising performance within the
context of modulation classiﬁcation and outperforms the
expert feature approaches. This exhaustive treatise opens
the door for our ultimate goal of PHY revolution. The
authors of [125] apply this innovative E2E technique to
MIMO system models and investigate the performance of
AEs across Rayleigh fading channels for various MIMO
conﬁgurations. In the ﬁrst case, an AE optimizes its encoding
scheme during training to introduce spatial diversity in a 2×1
MIMO setup. Compared to the well-known Alamouti coding,
the AE creates a superior encoding scheme without CSI at
the transmitter, as demonstrated in simulations, where the
AE achieves slightly higher diversity in two time slots. This
improvement is the consequence of the uneven distribution
of power across antennas. In the second case, another AE is
trained to obtain spatial multiplexing with lower BER than a
traditional MIMO system in a 2 × 2 MIMO setting. Similar
to the situation of spatial diversity, the AE generates better
spatial multiplexing code and yields substantially higher
BER performance.

[126] extends the single-input single-output (SISO) IC
system over AWGN channel investigated in [25] to SISO and
MIMO interference channel systems over Rayleigh fading
channel. The proposed AE [25] with a modulation order
of four in a SISO interference channel system performs
slightly better than the standard single-user no interference
MIMO system using the QPSK modulation scheme. The
demonstration of the received signals reveals well-separated
four regions corresponding to the constellation points, which
indicates how effectively the AE learns how to transmit
with a modulation order of four. With the AE trained in a
MIMO interference channel, performance improvement be-
comes considerable compared to the standard single-user no
interference MIMO system. Assuming the channel model is
available as in [25], the study in [127] proposes a block AE-
based E2E network to deal with the dynamic input lengths,
which is notable in terms of efﬁciency. The suggested
network employs RNN to build a memory mechanism.

Simulation results show that the RNN-based AE network
has superior performance over the CNN-based networks
in AWGN and custom fading channels. Furthermore, the
authors examine the learned 64-QAM constellation diagram.
The work in [128] provides another thorough research that
includes numerous examinations for E2E communication
systems. The principal motivation is to switch from symbol-
wise AE to bit-wise AE for the ﬁrst time in the literature
to show that optimizing bit metrics improves the overall
performance. Bit-wise AE with IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)
LDPC code outperforms the symbol-wise AE with IEEE
802.11n LDPC code and the conventional communication
using PSK or QAM. Also, the learned constellation analysis
proves that bit-wise optimization leads to a better sepa-
ration in the constellation, which is a solid indicator of
performance improvement. The authors further enhance the
BER performance by replacing the demapper of the model
with the iterative demapping and decoding scheme, which
results in a superior BER performance compared to the
bit-wise AE without iterative demapping and decoding at
the receiver. In addition, they optimize the LDPC codes
used in iterative demapping and decoding-aided bit-wise AE
and obtain enhancement in the BER performance. Although
the AWGN channel is assumed in computer simulations,
the strength of the proposed technique is its ﬂexibility to
be applied to any channel model without modiﬁcation, as
demonstrated by simulations utilizing software-deﬁned radio
(SDR). The study in [129] investigates a solution to the
problem of ﬁnding (n, k) block codes to maximize the
minimum Hamming distance between the codewords by
using AEs. Along with a custom loss function, the authors
suggest
two receiver structures depending on DNN and
bidirectional RNN. The proposed model performs almost the
same as the optimal block codes in the AWGN channel,
and the minimum Hamming distance learned by the AE
achieves its optimal value speciﬁed in theory. In addition,
AE-based block code outperforms the theoretical optimum
under channel model mismatches in which the performance
difference increases as the correlation level grows.

According to the reviewed major studies in the litera-
ture, we note that there is noticeable progress toward en-
tirely intelligent and E2E optimized wireless communication
systems by replacing all separate blocks in conventional
communication systems with a single massive DL network.
Without a doubt, there will be more developments soon to
incorporate these innovative approaches into real life. In the
next subsection, we will explore the emerging applications
of DL in transforming classical IM to make it a compelling
technology for 6G.

E. DL-Empowered IM 2.0: Improving Efﬁciency of
Conventional IM
We have covered the main developments in DL applications
for massive MIMO systems thus far, beginning with symbol
detection at the receiver and progressing to E2E intelligent

communication systems. Another promising aspect within
the 6G vision is MIMO-IM, which, as previously stated, en-
ables high energy and spectral efﬁciency together while also
decreasing the number of required RF chains by leveraging
the building blocks of a communication system as additional
information sources. However, the trade-off between detector
complexity and BER performance is an issue for IM systems.
In addition, employing several advanced algorithms such
as transmit antenna selection (TAS), power allocation, and
MCS selection can further improve the BER performance
of IM systems. Because of the immense complexity of
traditional methods to implement these algorithms, DL ap-
proaches seem appealing for the efﬁciency improvement of
IM systems. Fig. 19 categorizes the primary contributions of
DL to IM systems.

The study in [130] proposes a novel data-driven frame-
work for TAS and power allocation issues in SM-MIMO
systems by considering two different ML techniques. As
the framework achieves feasible
the initial contribution,
solutions with decreased complexity comparing conventional
optimization approaches by utilizing supervised-learning
classiﬁers such as the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and
support vector machine (SVM). The authors examine a
DNN-based framework for optimization tasks in the second
part. Furthermore, they explore the impact of feature vector
design on BER performance for both methods. Speciﬁcally,
they suggest three distinct feature vector generation (FVG)
methods: conventional FVG with the modulus of the channel
elements, separate FVG with the modulus of the real and
imaginary parts of the channel elements, and joint FVG with
the correlation of the channel matrix’s column pairs. Ex-
tensive simulations over various MIMO conﬁgurations and
modulation schemes show that SVM-based TAS-SM out-
performs KNN-based TAS-SM, while DNN-based TAS-SM
exceeds both. Joint FVG has superior performance than the
other two FVG approaches with near-optimal performance.
Similarly, the DNN-based power allocation in SM with joint
FVG achieves the best BER performance compared to other
power allocation scheme and FVG combinations. On top of
that, [131] minimizes the computing overhead by removing
the repeated elements of the antenna selection process. The
proposed DNN outperforms the proposed method in [130]
with fewer hidden neurons in which both schemes employ
the joint FVG technique. However, Euclidean distance-
optimized antenna selection (EDAS) has substantial perfor-
mance than these DNN-based TAS-SM techniques.

In [132], the authors suggest a DNN-based and a gradient
boosting decision tree based TAS-SM technique. Consider-
ing the importance of features obtained from the channel ma-
trix, they employ channel matrix correlation, same with the
joint FVG in [130], as the feature vector. Simulation results
indicate that both DNN- and gradient boosting decision tree
based TAS-SM methods perform near-optimal performance
while outperforming conventional SM and random TAS-
SM schemes. In addition, gradient boosting decision tree

tion, KNN of [130], and other traditional antenna selection
algorithms.

Apart from TAS and power allocation, MCS selection is
another essential concept for enhancing the efﬁciency of
IM systems. The study in [136] describes a DNN-based
codebook selection method for SM-MIMO systems. The
receiver predicts the symbol error rate (SER) corresponding
to each codebook using the instantaneous channel state and
sends the optimal codebook back to the transmitter. Each
codebook assigns different constellation combinations to
transmit antennas, where the total number of bits per channel
use remains constant. Dynamically switching between these
codebooks according to DNN-based SER predictions yields
signiﬁcantly better results than using any codebook through-
out the transmission. The work in [137] offers a DNN-based
approach to calculating mutual information of an SM-MIMO
system on the ﬂy, allowing for dynamic MCS adaptation. The
authors explore different input feature vectors, where they
contain some features from channel matrix and SNR. The
proposed DNN-based method obtains mutual information
almost perfectly with signiﬁcantly lower complexity than
traditional Taylor and Jensen approximations, paving the
door for MCS adaptation. Furthermore, the authors expand
their analyses in [138] to calculate the channel capacity
of a GSM-MIMO system model, for the same purpose
with [137] as allowing dynamic adaptation. The suggested
DNN-based model computes the capacity with almost no
error, as provided by simulations.

[139] presents a DNN-based code rate selection technique
in SM-MIMO systems. The proposed DNN extracts the
norms of channel matrix columns and the angles between
each pair of channel matrix columns and combines them
with SNR as input features, as described in [137]. The DNN
output is the maximum coding rate that is suitable under
a BER constraint. Simulation results show that DNN-based
dynamic code rate selection delivers near-maximum through-
put and substantially outperforms the ﬁxed-rate scenarios
under a BER constraint. The authors extend their model
in [140] to predict the optimal MCS rather than only code
rate depending on the same input features. The DNN-based
MCS selection approach attains near-maximum performance,
as does the sole coding rate optimization scenario in [139],
indicating enhanced efﬁciency in SM-MIMO systems.

In contrast to the former studies, [141] provides a DNN-
based modulation order selection scheme without consider-
ing the coding rate of the system. The recommended DNN
model predicts the optimal modulation order by maximizing
the minimum Euclidean distance, similar to the methods
implemented in TAS-IM algorithms. Simulation results in-
dicate that DNN-based modulation order selection aided
SM-MIMO signiﬁcantly outperforms the classical SM with
substantially lower complexity than conventional selection
algorithms.

FIGURE 19. Four main applications of DL in MIMO-IM.

attains lower complexity than DNN with slightly worse BER
performance. Similar to [132], the work in [133] provides a
DNN-based and a decision tree based TAS-GSM scheme
under practical channel scenarios. The authors create a
16 × 4 test-bed using SDRs for tests and estimation of
the impairments of the channel for theoretical optimization
benchmark. Experiments reveal that the suggested techniques
outperform EDAS while DNN-based TAS-GSM exceeds de-
cision tree based TAS-GSM under the real-life scenario. The
authors of [134] offer another TAS-SM scheme depending
on DNNs combining the modulus of the channel matrix
and the channel matrix correlation as the feature vector,
which corresponds to the combination of conventional FVG
and joint FVG in [130]. DNN-based TAS-SM with the
recommended FVG type performs similarly to EDAS while
outperforming random forest decision-based TAS-SM and
various conventional TAS-SM schemes and achieves lower
complexity.

The TAS problem is addressed in [135] for full-duplex
SM systems in which self-interference is a crucial issue
using DNN and SVM methods. The authors ﬁrst derive
the upper and lower bounds of the full-duplex SM’s chan-
nel capacity and subsequently utilize these derivations in
EDAS and capacity-optimized antenna selection to generate
a training label set. In contrast to previous TAS methods
majority of which use joint FVG of [130], they propose
eigenvector FVG based on principal component analysis to
extract vector features of the channel matrix and enhance the
BER performance. Extensive simulations illustrate that the
proposed eigenvector FVG leads to a better performance than
joint FVG of [130] in various transmit antenna number and
modulation scheme settings. The proposed DNN and SVM
methods function almost the same and are comparable to

Studies discovered thus far unlock the potential of IM
systems for future 6G and beyond communication technolo-
gies, owing to DL approaches that further enhance system
efﬁciency by employing sophisticated algorithms such as
TAS, power allocation, and MCS selection with remarkably
low complexity. We may now conclude the examination
of the literature on DL-aided MIMO systems and move
on to the implementation of the generic MIMO-IM model
presented in [49], which might give a sense of MIMO-DL
programming to interested readers.

F. MIMO-DL in Action
GSM is one of the most promising techniques for the PHY
of future wireless communication systems by combining
the beneﬁts of SM and MIMO. Reducing the number of
required RF chains by activating only a subset of the transmit
antennas, GSM has lower complexity than conventional
MIMO. It also improves SM efﬁciency by activating more
transmit antennas and conveying more information bits.
However, when the number of transmit antenna combinations
and information bits increases,
the complexity of MLD
detection escalates to intolerable levels, as discussed earlier.
On the other hand, linear detectors, such as ZF and MMSE
detectors, produce signiﬁcantly worse BER performance than
MLD, introducing a trade-off into GSM systems. To address
this BER-complexity trade-off, the authors of [49] suggest
a DNN-based detector for GSM systems. They consider
a GSM system model with Nt transmit and Nr receive
antennas (Nr < Nt), where Np (2 ≤ Np (cid:28) Nt) out of Nt
transmit antennas are selected by index bits to be activated in
any time slot. There are N = 2(cid:98)log2(Nt
Np)(cid:99) legitimate transmit
antenna combinations (TAC), where each active antenna
transmits a symbol from normalized M -QAM constellation
S. Thus, the total number of bits transmitted in each time
slot equals B = log2N + Nplog2M .

Assuming a quasi-static ﬂat fading MIMO channel matrix,
H ∈ CNr×Nt, the entries of which follow complex Gaussian
distribution CN (0, 1), the received signal vector y ∈ CNr×1
can be expressed as follows:

y = Hx + n = HI s + n,

(10)

where x is the vector of transmit symbols, n ∈ CNr×1 is the
additive white Gaussian noise samples vector with complex
Gaussian distribution CN (0, σ2I), s is the symbol vector of
the active transmit antennas, and HI is the channel matrix
corresponding to the active transmit antennas.

The optimal MLD detector for this GSM transmission
scheme performs an exhaustive search over all possible TACs
and information symbols, as shown below

( ˆI, ˆs) = arg min

(11)

where I = {I1, I2, . . . , IN } is the set of legitimate TACs

transmit antennas. The linear detectors deal with solving an

inverse operation including the channel matrix, H, which
can be given as follows:

(12)

ˆxZF = (HH H)−1HH y,
ˆxMM SE = (HH H + σ2I)−1HH y.
Here, ˆxZF and ˆxMM SE represent detected symbol vectors
by ZF and MMSE detectors, respectively. To perform a
successful inverse operation, Nr should at least equal to
Nt which ensures that HH H has a full rank. However,
this requirement reduces the practical feasibility of GSM in
massive MIMO systems with hundreds of transmit antennas
at the BS since it is almost impossible for a user equipment to
install that many antennas. Therefore, block linear detectors
slightly change the equations in (12) and employ HI instead
of H, which results in N solutions of ˆsI for each legitimate
TAC. In the ﬁnal stage, block linear detectors compare the
Euclidean distance between the received signal vector y and
each HIˆsI product to estimate selected TAC and QAM
symbols, as given below

This block-structured detection scheme achieves better
BER performance than the classical linear detectors since
it incorporates the MLD approach to the linear detectors.
However, complexity increases with the growing number of
transmit antennas, as expected, and the block detection still
performs worse than the optimal MLD due to the suboptimal
linear part. Thus,
the authors of [49] replace the linear
component of the block detection with a DNN to enhance
the accuracy of ˆsI estimation. Fig. 20 demonstrates the GSM
transmitter and the considered block-DNN detector.

VOLUME ,

FIGURE 20. System model of the B-DNN detector that integrates a DNN into classical block detection for GSM systems [49].

As shown in Fig. 20, the block-DNN detector consists of
two stages: FVG and feed-forward DNN. In the ﬁrst stage,
the FVG generates the input feature vector di of the feed-
forward DNN by processing the raw data composed of the
received signal vector y and the channel matrix HI corre-
sponding to the ith legitimate TAC. As described in [130], the
selected FVG type signiﬁcantly impacts model performance,
and the joint FVG results in the best performance among the
other FVG types for the model suggested in [130]. Hence,
the authors of [49] explore the inﬂuence of FVG type on
detection reliability and evaluate the BER performance of the
block-DNN detector for three FVG kinds described in [130]:
separate FVG, joint FVG, and conventional FVG. Combining
the feature vectors of all legitimate TACs, the FVG creates
the feature matrix D and feeds it to the feed-forward DNN.
In the second stage, the DNN yields a ˆsI for each di. The
feed-forward DNN contains Np sub-DNNs to estimate the
QAM symbol corresponding to each active transmit antenna.
Finally, the block-DNN detector employs (13) to obtain the
selected TAC and QAM symbols. We reproduce some of the
ﬁgures in [49] using the network and training parameters
given in Table 4 and share some portion of example codes.
The training procedure of any block-DNN detector ignores
the GSM scheme at the transmitter, assuming all transmit
antennas are active, which makes sense since DNN is only
responsible for detecting QAM symbols given a TAC. In
addition, the received signal does not experience AWGN
during the training. Here is an example model creation of
a DNN with separate FVG for QPSK transmission, which is
another version of model deﬁnition in Keras different than
what we provided in Section II-B:

the number of picking unordered b items out of a items, Con-
stellation returns a symbol set given a modulation level M
and modulation type, like PSK or QAM. OptimalTAC Set
creates the set of legitimate TACs from all possible TACs.
Optimality indicates that
is not created by
randomly picking some of the TACs, instead TAC set is
created so that the number of each transmit antenna in the set
is either equal or close to each other. Now, we can construct
the input training data:

the TAC set

The number of training instances is equal to Ns. For input
of each training data, we ﬁrst randomly generate a bit array
and encode these bits into a transmit vector x by using
EncodeBits function. Subsequently, we randomly generate a
i.i.d. channel matrix H whose elements follow the complex
Gaussian distribution CN (0, 1) via Channel function, and
multiply it with x. The input data is the concatenation of
the feature vectors of the received signal vector y and the
channel matrix H. The labels for this training data are the
correct symbols transmitted from all antennas:

The codes, trained models, simulations for testing the B-

detectors and MLD, as well as the generated ﬁgures are
available in our online database1. Fig. 21(a) illustrates that
the proposed block-DNN detector outperforms the conven-
tional block-linear detectors and performs similar to the

optimal MLD detection assuming Nt = 4, Nr = 2,
Np = 2, and QPSK modulation. It should be noted that,
compared to MLD, the proposed B-DNN model can achieve
similar results with less time complexity. Fig 21(b) shows
the impact of FVG type on the BER performance of B-
DNN detector under the same setting with the former except
BPSK modulation. In contrast to the model of [130], where
joint FVG produces the best performance, the block-DNN
detector that employs separate FVG delivers the best BER
performance, while the other FVG types cause unreliable
communication with a BER value of almost 0.5 across
all SNR levels. Thus,
the appropriate FVG type might
vary depending on the application, necessitating thorough
examination during the validation step. Finally, Fig. 21(c)
provides the BER performance of the block-DNN detector
under various modulation levels, assuming the same antenna
settings as before. The block-DNN with BPSK obtains the
best BER performance, while 16-QAM performs the worst,
as expected. As a trade-off, increasing the modulation order
provides higher bit rates.

With this striking implementation, we may now end this
part and go on to the following section’s examination of DL
methods for MC waveforms.

the physical

IV. DL for Multicarrier Waveform Design
shape of
Waveform, which characterizes
information-carrying signals, is one of the key components of
wireless communication systems [20]. Existing waveforms
can be categorized into two groups as single-carrier (SC)
and MC waveforms. In order to increase the data rate in a
SC or MC system, symbol duration needs to be decreased
or equivalently bandwidth occupied for data transmission
should be increased. However, with the adoption of wider
bandwidth, SC waveforms suffer from frequency-selective
fading that causes inter-symbol interference (ISI) since sym-
bol duration is less than the delay spread of the wireless
channel. Since complex equalization techniques should be
applied to reduce ISI,
is very challenging to provide
high data rates with the existing SC waveforms. In an
MC system, the frequency band is divided into many sub-
bands which are also known as subcarriers [142]. These
subcarriers are employed in parallel to convey information
bits simultaneously. The spacing between two consecutive
subcarriers is selected such that each of them undergoes ﬂat
fading in the frequency domain. Hence, a simple single-tap
equalizer may be utilized to remove the channel effect in
MC systems. Consequently, MC techniques enable wideband
transmission to convey information; therefore, they yield
higher data rates than SC techniques.

it

OFDM appears as the most popular MC waveform and
has been used in numerous standards such as LTE and the
IEEE 802.11 family due to its simple and effective structure.
Owing to the overlapped orthogonal subcarriers, OFDM is
capable of using the spectrum efﬁciently. Moreover,
the
time frequency grid of OFDM allows the ﬂexible use of

resource elements. In conventional OFDM systems, modu-
lated data symbols for each data subcarrier are determined
in the frequency domain by mapping information bits to the
PSK/QAM constellation. A certain number of subcarriers
are allocated for the transmission of pilot symbols in order
to perform channel estimation at the receiver side. These
pilot symbols can be inserted into the OFDM symbol with
block or comb type methods [143]. Channel coefﬁcients
can be estimated in the time-domain or frequency-domain
and numerous estimation techniques, which provide different
performance and complexity, have been proposed for these
two domains [144], [145]. In the frequency domain, the
channel frequency response is estimated by exploiting pilot
symbols and is interpolated to obtain the channel frequency
response over data symbols. For example, the least squares
(LS) and the linear minimum mean error square (LMMSE)
are two well-known frequency domain channel estimation
methods. After inserting pilot symbols, the time domain
OFDM signal is obtained by employing the inverse fast
Fourier transform (IFFT). Furthermore, a CP is embedded
in the beginning or end of the OFDM symbol to eliminate
ISI. Additionally, the CP allows us to model the frequency
selective channel as circular convolution. After adding a CP,
the OFDM signal is transmitted through the wireless commu-
nication channel. At the receiver side, the CP is removed and
the frequency domain OFDM signal is acquired by taking
FFT. Channel estimation is performed and equalization is
applied to remove the effect of the wireless channel. Finally,
the signal is demodulated to obtain information.

Although OFDM has several advantages as discussed
above, it also has many drawbacks such as high PAPR,
sensitivity to frequency and timing errors, high out-of-band
emissions (OOBE), and CP&pilot overhead. After IFFT op-
eration, the subcarriers are randomly summed up in the time
domain and this may cause high peaks due to the overlapping
of the peak amplitudes of different signals. The power
ampliﬁer at the transmitter works in the nonlinear region
due to these high peaks, generating distortion and spectral
dispersion. These peaks give rise to high PAPR that re-
duces the efﬁciency of the power ampliﬁer, analog-to-digital,
and digital-to-analog converters. Therefore, researchers have
designed various PAPR reduction techniques for OFDM
transmission systems [146]. Another drawback of OFDM is
sensitivity to intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by high
mobility, phase noise, timing offset, and carrier frequency
offset (CFO). The channel in a mobile wireless environment
rapidly changes with respect to time. This places a strain on
the receiver since it must precisely estimate the channel prior
to coherent detection. The most critical consequence of this
time variation is the distortion of the orthogonality between
subcarriers resulting in ICI, whose intensity is determined
by the amount of channel time variation. Furthermore, ICI
may also occur due to the frequency difference between
the local oscillators of the transmitter and receiver. Since
ICI disrupts OFDM subcarriers, data detection becomes

VOLUME ,

29

OZPOYRAZ et al.: DEEP LEARNING-AIDED 6G WIRELESS NETWORKS: A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF REVOLUTIONARY PHY ARCHITECTURES

less accurate, and a single tap equalizer can not provide
satisfactory performance. Thus, more complicated methods
are required to decode OFDM symbols. To combat
this
difﬁcult interference mitigation problem under high mobility
environments or in the presence of CFO, several decoding
algorithms have been proposed [147]. Another important
concern with OFDM systems is their excessive out-of-band
emissions (OOBE) that should be diminished to prevent
adjacent channel
interference. The OFDM signal has a
rectangular pulse in the time domain, which generates a
sinc signal in the frequency domain. The sidelobes of the
sinc signals at the edge carriers bring tremendous interfer-
ence; therefore, they should be minimized. OOBE decreases
through various windowing/ﬁltering methods together with
guard band allocation to fulﬁll the spectrum mask criteria
of the different standards. Nonetheless, spectral efﬁciency
degrades due to the ﬁxed guard band allocation. Lastly, in
OFDM systems, inserting CP and pilot symbols is highly
indispensable. However, the spectral efﬁciency reduces be-
cause of reserving a considerable number of resources for
CP and pilot overhead.

In recent years, many different and attractive OFDM-based
MC waveforms have been designed to alleviate the draw-
backs of OFDM. Windowed-OFDM (W-OFDM) has been
proposed to reduce OOBE by applying windowing operation
to classical OFDM. Filter bank MC (FBMC) [148], which
implements subcarrier-wise ﬁltering operation, has been in-
troduced. FBMC can use the spectrum more efﬁciently and
is more resilient under high mobility compared to OFDM
in the expense of additional signal processing. Generalized
frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) [149], which also
performs ﬁltering at the subcarrier level like FBMC, appears
as a remarkably ﬂexible waveform since it does not have
to meet the orthogonality requirement. Another engaging
waveform is universal ﬁltered MC (UFMC) that applies ﬁl-
tering to subbands instead of subcarriers [150]. UFMC needs
less redundancy in comparison to FBMC; however, it is not
applicable for very high data rates. As mentioned previously,
since the orthogonality of its subcarriers is disrupted, OFDM
is highly susceptible to high Doppler which leads to ICI. Or-
thogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation appears
as a promising waveform that brings a clever solution to
this disadvantage of OFDM [151]. Even in high-Doppler
channels, OTFS assures that each transmitted symbol has a
near-constant channel gain by converting the time-varying
multipath channel
into a two-dimensional delay-Doppler
channel. Finally, OFDM with IM (OFDM-IM) emerges as
a promising OFDM-based waveform that changes only the
modulation/demodulation processes of plain OFDM system
and offers an additional degree of freedom for waveform
design thanks to the ﬂexibility of IM [152]. It is clear that all
waveforms mentioned above have both some advantages and
disadvantages over OFDM. Because of its simple structure,
OFDM was chosen for also 5G networks, and we believe that
it will maintain its importance for future wireless systems.

FIGURE 22. DL applications in MC systems.

Against this background, DL emerges as an appealing tool
to solve challenging problems in designing MC transmission
systems. For instance, DL can be used to improve the
subblocks of MC systems such as channel estimation and
symbol detection or to optimize the whole transmission and
reception pipeline jointly. In literature, a vast number of
interesting DL-based methods are developed to enhance the
performance of existing MC schemes. Under the subsection
of transceiver design, as seen from Fig. 22, we present both
DL-based receiver architectures and also joint designs of
transmitter and receiver. Then, in the second subsection, DL-
based techniques, which address the shortcomings of OFDM,
are investigated. These techniques provide signiﬁcant im-
provements that encourage us to believe in the feasibility
of DL-based solutions for future MC systems.

A. Transceiver Design
In this subsection, an overview of the studies in the literature
review on DL-based receiver and transceiver designs, that is
the studies that focus on the joint optimization of both trans-
mitter and receiver structures, is provided. For the receiver
design, most studies mainly focus on the implementation
of DL-based techniques for channel estimation and symbol
detection. For the transceiver design, the processing blocks
at the transmitter and receiver are devised together by using
AE-based approaches to optimize the system as a whole.

DL has been implemented for channel estimation and
symbol detection in an OFDM system for the ﬁrst time
in [153]. In this study, DNNs have been shown to be
capable of learning and evaluating wireless channel prop-
erties. The proposed DNN architecture, which is trained
with the simulated OFDM symbols, has been designed as
data-driven and fully-connected. When the number of pilots
is reduced or CP is completely removed,
the proposed
DNN-based receiver outperforms the traditional algorithms
such as LS and MMSE in terms of error performance.
Moreover,
the DNN-based receiver provides better error
performance than LS and MMSE in the presence of clipping
noise. In [154], a low complexity DNN called SimNet with

to perform channel estimation. A meta-learning-based NN
called robust channel estimation with meta NNs, RoemNet,
is also introduced [155]. Since it leverages meta-learner,
RoemNet can tackle new channel learning problems with
a minimal number of pilots. DeepRx, which improves the
channel estimation and symbol detection performance sig-
niﬁcantly by adjusting the inputs of NN in a clever way,
is another DL-based data-driven approach [156]. Since it
supports 5G frame structure including different modulation
schemes or pilot conﬁgurations, DeepRx is compatible with
5G communication systems. The output of DeepRx has
been determined such that various QAM schemes can be
supported by training only a single NN. The authors investi-
gated both coded and uncoded error performance of DeepRx
and compared it to the well-known LMMSE receiver. It is
indicated that DeepRx outperforms LMMSE for different
pilot conﬁgurations. Additionally, DeepRx has superiority
over LMMSE in the presence of Doppler shift and inter-cell
interference. The aforementioned NNs work with real-valued
tensors and this can cause DNN to have more complexity and
a decrease in their performance. In [157], a deep complex-
valued convolutional network, that works in complex ﬁelds
and decodes bits from time domain OFDM signals without
requiring any IFFT/FFT operation, has been proposed.

A model-driven approach called ComNet [158], which
designs two different DNNs for channel estimation and
symbol detection blocks, has been proposed instead of
performing channel estimation and symbol detection jointly
in [153]. These two DNNs are initialized by conventional
wireless communication solutions. Thanks to the beneﬁt of
expert knowledge, it becomes possible to reduce the need
for training data and converge faster with the model-driven
method compared to data driven one [153]. Additionally,
simulation results have shown that ComNet outperforms rival
channel estimation and symbol detection algorithms such
as LMMSE channel estimation, fully-connected DNN [153],
MMSE symbol detection. The mismatch between the chan-
nel model for ofﬂine training and the real environment,
which causes a performance gap between the simulation and
the over-the-air test, is detected in [159]. To overcome this
problem, a novel online training system called SwitchNet
receiver is designed to catch channel characteristics that were
neglected during ofﬂine training. SwitchNet pretrains mul-
tiple channel estimation ReﬁneNet of ComNet with diverse
channel conditions and selects the network by online learn-
ing. Another model-driven approach is DeepWiPHY [160],
a DL-based OFDM receiver that is completely compatible
with the newest Wi-Fi standard IEEE 802.11ax. In contrast
to above mentioned designs, DeepWiPHY receiver is trained
with not only a synthetic data set but also a real-world
data set created by using universal software radio peripheral
(USRP) modules. Finally, a model-driven technique, that
divides channel estimation into three CNN-based networks,
is also proposed [161].

FIGURE 23. Representation of the time-frequency grid as a 2D
image [162].

Authors of [162]–[170] have considered the time fre-
quency response of wireless channel as a 2D image as in
Fig. 23 where LR and HR stand for low resolution and
high resolution, respectively. In [163], the channel response
at the pilot positions is regarded as low resolution image
and the estimated channel is a high resolution image. A
DL-based receiver called ChannelNet
including two dif-
ferent CNNs, super-resolution CNN [171] and denoising
CNN [172], which improves the resolution of low resolution
image and eliminates the effect of noise, respectively, is
designed. In [162],
inspired from the image super res-
olution technique [173] and conditioned image synthesis
technology [174], two cascaded NNs, channel estimation
network and channel conditional recovery network, have
been used to estimate the channel and detect the signal.
In [164], a DL-based channel estimation method, that does
not need for training, has been introduced for multidimen-
sional OFDM signals. Another channel estimation technique,
that combines the conventional LS estimator with fast super
resolution CNN, FSRCNN, [175] to increase the estimation
performance, has been presented [166]. A deep residual
channel estimation network, ReEsNet, whose architecture is
optimized by taking advantage of residual learning, [165]
is introduced to outperform ChannelNet [163]. A CNN-
based NN architecture called FreqTimeNet [168], [169], that
performs learning in both time and frequency domain, is
introduced for channel estimation. FreqTimeNet decreases
the complexity by facilitating the orthogonality between two
domains. Comprehensive simulation results have indicated
that FreqTimeNet outperforms ChannelNet and ReEsNet.
Furthermore, another NN design called AttenFreqTimeNet,
that includes a widely used DL technique called attention
mechanism, has been presented. Since it employs SNR
information, AttenFreqTimeNet outperforms FreqTimeNet.
A CNN-based DL structure called dual CNN, that takes
advantage of both angle-delay domain and spatial-frequency
domain,
is introduced. Moreover, another novel network
called HyperNet is proposed to further enhance the robust-
ness. In [170], a GAN-based NN called SRGAN is exploited
for super resolution to obtain the whole channel response.
Due to the employment of discriminator, the proposed chan-
nel estimator has superiority over ReEsNet and traditional
techniques such as LMMSE.

It is also possible to implement DL-based techniques at
both transmitter and receiver sides. Thus, the whole OFDM
transceiver pipeline can be optimized jointly by utilizing
the AE-based structure. In [176], authors have shown that
it is possible to integrate the E2E system into an OFDM
system. Furthermore, for wireless picture transmission across
multipath fading channels with nonlinear disstortion, a DL-
based joint source-channel coding technique is given [177].
Lastly, in [178], a DL-based MC system called MC-AE, that
optimizes modulation and demodulation operations jointly to
maximize coding and diversity gain, is presented. This MC-
AE system is explained in the following subsection in detail.
On the other hand, various NNs have been designed
for channel estimation and symbol detection in OFDM-IM-
based schemes. In [179], a fully-connected DNN, called
DeepIM, is used for symbol detection of OFDM-IM. The
efﬁciency of the DNN in signal detection of OFDM-IM
is demonstrated in terms of both error performance and
decoding complexity. A preprocessing based on domain
knowledge is applied to the received signal before inputting
it to DeepIM. CNN-based receiver has also been proposed
where the received symbols are converted to polar coordi-
nates to ease the decoding of information bits transmitted
by active subcarriers [180]. To enhance the performance of
channel estimation and symbol detection for pilot-assisted
OFDM-IM, complex DNN and complex CNN have been
exploited [181]. Additionally, a detector called DeepDM
that includes both a DNN and a CNN is introduced for
an OFDM-IM-based scheme, dual-mode OFDM-IM (DM-
OFDM-IM) [182]. In DeepDM, CNN and DNN are used to
detect index bits and QAM/PSK modulated bits, respectively.
Another receiver called IMNet is also proposed to detect
IM-aided MIMO-OFDM, IM-MIMO-OFDM, signals [183].
Finally, the performance of DNN-based receiver is investi-
gated for sparse vector coding OFDM which can also be
considered as a member of OFDM-IM family [184].

DNN-based receivers have been designed for also other
waveforms such as UFMC, FBMC, GFDM, and OTFS.
In [185], for two-stage index modulated UFMC system,
a DL-based signal detector called TSIMNet, is proposed
over multipath underwater acoustic channels. DNN-based
and ResNet-DNN based receivers have been presented for
channel estimation and symbol detection of FBMC systems
in [186], [187], respectively. Moreover, in [188], a damped
generalized approximation message passing method is sug-
gested to minimize receiver complexity in OTFS systems,
with the damping factors tuned using DL approaches. A data-
driven DNN-based method [189], another low-complexity
DNN-based technique [190] that equalizes received signal
at the symbol level, and 2D CNN-based design [191] have
been proposed for the equalization task at the OTFS receiver.
Additionally, in [192], authors have presented a novel DNN-
based framework for the equalization of both SISO and
MIMO-OTFS systems. DNN-based transceiver architectures
have also been introduced for the detection of OTFS signals

under IQ imbalance [193] and PAPR reduction [194]. Lastly,
DL-aided receivers are presented for GFDM and GFDM-IM
systems [195], [196].

In Table 5 and 6, we demonstrate DL-based channel
estimation and symbol detection methods with their respec-
tive NN techniques for OFDM and OFDM-based alternative
waveforms such as FBMC and GFDM. Here, we note
that SD and CE represent symbol detection and channel
estimation, respectively. It can be seen from Table 5 that
CNN is more frequently exploited particularly for channel
estimation due to its ability to learn the correlation in a time-
frequency grid.

B. DL-Based OFDM 2.0: Overcoming Drawbacks of
Classical OFDM
In this subsection, an overview of the literature on DL-based
techniques to deal with the main disadvantages of OFDM
is given. By enjoying particularly deep unfolding approach,
numerous DL-based schemes are proposed to improve the
performance of classical OFDM systems.

In [197], a novel PAPR reduction network, PRNet, is
proposed where PAPR and BER performance are jointly
optimized thanks to its AE-based architecture. Furthermore,
a low-complex real-valued NN is presented to reduce PAPR
and minimize BER at
the same time [198]. Since the
proposed method in [198] is implemented in the time domain
unlike PRNet,
it can provide a reduction in complexity.
Nonetheless, optimizing different metrics increases the com-
putational complexity considerably. Motivated from model-
driven approach, A DL-based tone reservation network,
is proposed to improve only the PAPR
namely TRNet,
performance to increase the training speed [199]. TRNet
improves the performance of the classical tone reservation
method and in contrast to PRNet, it is applied only at the
transmitter side. Another tone reservation-based DL method
called DL-TR is introduced in [200] where conventional
tone reservation method is unfolded to design a DNN.
Moreover, in [201], a model-driven DL-based tone reser-
vation technique, which yields low-complexity due to its
clever design, is proposed by unfolding an iterative tone
reservation scheme as a layer of DNN. In [202], the usage
of residual NNs with soft-clipping is presented as a novel
PAPR reduction approaches. Authors of [203] have proposed
to employ a DNN at the transmitter to develop a high-
dimensional modulation method that enables regulation of
both the PAPR and adjacent channel leakage ratio. Another
NN is implemented at the receiver side to decode informa-
tion bits. Finally, an AE-based PAPR reduction method is
introduced for pre-coded OFDM signals without reducing
the OOBE performance [204].

In order to remove the CP in OFDM systems, a model-
driven DL technique based on orthogonal approximate mes-
sage passing (DL-OAMP) is presented [205], [206]. The
channel estimation module of ComNet [158] and the OAMP
detection NN, OAMP-Net, that merges the OAMP method

and DL by incorporating a few trainable parameters, are
included in the DL-OAMP receiver. Authors have shown
that the complexity of DL-OAMP is lower than ComNet
and DL-OAMP is capable of adapting time-varying channels.
In [206], the performance of OAMP-NET is investigated not
only by extensive simulation and also by employing a real
communication system. Another model-driven DL method
based on OAMP algorithm has also been proposed for CP
removal in MIMO-OFDM systems [207]. Although CP is
inserted to time-domain OFDM signal to avoid ICI, its length
may not be long enough in some practical scenarios. In
case of insufﬁcient CP, model-driven DL-based receivers are
designed for the detection of SISO-OFDM [208] and MIMO-
OFDM [209] signals. In addition to CP, pilot overhead needs
to be considered in OFDM systems to increase spectral
efﬁciency. In [210], ﬁrstly, the number of pilot symbols is
removed partially without a decrease in error performance.
Secondly, by using an AE-based NN, pilots are completely
removed along with a learned constellation or superimposed
pilots. In order to increase the throughput considerably,
authors of [211] addressed both CP and pilot reduction
issues and demonstrated that it is possible to eliminate CP
and pilot entirely by exploiting E2E learning. In [212], for
frequency division duplex massive MIMO-OFDM systems,
an NN-based combined downlink pilot design and channel
estimation approach is presented. An efﬁcient pilot reduction
approach is also suggested for reducing pilot overhead and
saving time-frequency resources for data transmission by
progressively pruning less important neurons from dense
layers. Lastly,
to solve the channel estimation problem,
a pilotless AE-based E2E learning technique is presented
in [213] where a CNN and two DNN are implemented in
the transmitter and receiver side, respectively.

As mentioned earlier, high mobility causes ICI in OFDM
signals and this ICI disrupts the orthogonality between
subcarriers and makes the detection process considerably
challenging. DL emerges as an interesting tool to be able

to detect OFDM signals in fast time varying environment.
In [214], a channel estimation network, ChanEstNet, which
exploits a CNN and a RNN, is introduced for channel estima-
tion in the high speed mobile scenarios. Moreover, this idea
is extended to MIMO systems [215]. DL-based cascaded
structures called ICINet [216] and Cascade-Net [217] are
also proposed for channel estimation and symbol detection
for rapidly time varying channels. Lastly, AE-based DL
technique is also developed to cope with complex and fast
varying environments in marine communications [218].

In OFDM transmission systems, DL can be also used
to combat other impairments such as phase noise and
synchronization errors. For example, a DL-based receiver
called HybridDeepRx is introduced to detect nonlinearly
in order to
distorted OFDM signals [219]. Additionally,
alleviate nonlinear distortion in a MIMO-OFDM system,
authors of [220] have designed both model and data-driven
DL-based receivers. Furthermore, to mitigate the phase noise
in channel estimation and symbol detection in both GFDM
and OFDM systems, a DL-based method including DNN and
CNN, has been devised [221]. In [222], LSTM and DNN-
based technique has been utilized to diminish multi-tone
interference in a polar coded OFDM system. In [223], an
enhanced version of FC-DNN [153] is presented to perform
channel estimation and symbol detection in the presence of
timing synchronization error. Finally, under the restriction
of one-bit complex quantization, authors of [224] explore
innovative DL-based techniques for an OFDM receiver.

In Table 7, we provide a summary of the reviewed studies
that focus on DL-based designs to overcome some important
drawbacks of classical OFDM, such as high PAPR and CP
overhead. Particularly, deep unfolding comes into view as a
signiﬁcant concept to deal with the challenging impairments
of OFDM by unfolding conventional algorithms. For PAPR
reduction, AE-based NNs are advantageous since they can
still improve the error performance while reducing PAPR.

Although the DL-based methods show great promise, there
are still limitations and drawbacks related to the application
of DL-based solutions for MC waveforms. One of the most
important limitations is the fact that most studies focus on
optimizing only one performance metric such as BER and
PAPR. Unfortunately, the performance of MC systems relies
on multiple key performance indicators, which should be
considered in the design process. Implementation of these
indicators to DL model design is a challenging task and has
not been addressed in the literature. Also, the design process
requires the involvement of various 6G applications such as
eMBB, URLLC, mMTC, and their possible combinations.
These applications require speciﬁc challenges that need to
be considered in the DL model design.

C. An Example AE-Based OFDM System
In this subsection, we introduce an AE-based MC (MC-
AE) system proposed in [178]. The block diagram of MC-
AE is given in Fig. 24. In MC-AE, an OFDM system

with Nc number of subcarriers, is considered. These Nc
subcarriers are separated into G blocks, each containing
N subcarriers, where N = Nc/G. For each subblock, AE
method is performed independently. As seen in Fig. 24, the
modulator and demodulator blocks of the overall OFDM
system are modeled as encoder and decoder DNNs of an AE.
At the transmitter side, for the g-th subblock, g = 1, · · · , G,
the incoming message sg is mapped into a one-hot vector
s ∈ RM ×1. Note that the incoming message sg can be a bit
stream with length m. Then, s is passed through linear and
normalization layers and converted into a complex-valued
vector xg. After that, the overall OFDM symbol is obtained
by concatenating all subblocks as ¯x = [xT
G]T.
After performing OFDM transmission procedures, ¯x is trans-
mitted through the Rayleigh channel and the received signal
is obtained. For the gth subblock, the frequency domain
input-output relationship can be given as

where yg, hg, and ng are the received signal, channel
coefﬁcient and AWGN vectors corresponding to the gth
subblock, respectively. The elements of hg and ng follow
the distributions CN (0, 1) and CN (0, σ2), respectively. The
average received SNR is deﬁned as ¯γ = Es/σ2, where
Es represents the average transmit power. At the receiver
side, the perfect CSI h is assumed to be known. The real
and imaginary parts of yg and hg are concatenated and
the resulting vector is given as an input to the decoder.
As seen in Fig. 24, the inputted vector is passed through
two different FC layers with activation functions ReLU and
softmax. Finally, the estimated message sg is obtained.

For the training of this AE-based structure, a set of random
incoming messages and randomly generated channel and
noise samples are used. The MSE loss function and SGD
optimization method are exploited for training.

The learned constellation for MC-AE system can be seen
in Fig. 25, where each marker represents the complex con-
stellation point of a subcarrier. In [178], it is demonstrated
that diversity and coding gains of MC-AE system are higher
than benchmark schemes thanks to the learned constellation
by the capability of AE structure. Therefore, the MC-AE
system can provide outstanding error performance in fading
channels.

V. DL-aided Communication Systems Through RIS
Communication through RISs, emerges as a new and promis-
ing technology for next-generation communication systems
due to its numerous advantages such as enabling smart radio
environments with low cost and high efﬁciency. The RIS
technology, which provides environmentally friendly solu-
tions while increasing wireless communication performance,
offers attractive advantages at low cost and complexity due to
its passive reﬂective architecture. Thus, the RIS technology
has started to be seen as a strong candidate to be an indis-
pensable part of next-generation systems, as an alternative
to massive MIMO systems [6].

An RIS interacts intelligently with incoming signals,
aiming to expand energy efﬁciency and coverage in radio
communication systems. The mentioned controlled interac-
tion is realized with the adaptive meta elements on intel-
ligent surfaces. It is aimed to obtain the optimum phase
conﬁguration and to optimize the wireless communication
performance by manipulating the incoming signals thanks
to these meta elements. Here, the incoming signals from
the BS are controlled over-the-air in real-time and reﬂected
to the receivers. Intelligent surfaces aim to increase the
signal level at the receiver side as well as extend the signal
coverage as illustrated in Fig. 26. Here, we consider the
scenario of coverage expansion for multiple users having
no line-of-sight path to the BS thanks to intelligent reﬂec-
tion phase conﬁguration by an RIS coated on a building.
To put it another way, RIS technologies enable intelligent
wireless communication environments using software con-
trol methodologies. Thanks to their ﬂexible mechanism, it
is possible to work in different frequency bands such as
terahertz communication with RISs [225] where it is crucial
to establish mass communication and reduce interference
between users.

An RIS, along with offering energy-efﬁcient signal mod-
ulation at low cost in intelligent radio environments, takes
an active role in secure and MU communication [226]. RIS-
assisted beamforming techniques can ensure the secrecy of
communication in the presence of a potential eavesdropper.
The fact that it can be used for wireless energy transfer
in low-energy applications such as wireless sensors, where
continuous energy supply is required, induces us to see RISs
frequently in areas such as the IoT. Smart surfaces, which
are capable of directing electromagnetic (EM) waves thanks
to their unique structure and free-working nature, might
be inﬂuential players in energy transfer [227]. Intelligent
surfaces that act as reﬂective relays in the communication
environment affected by poor environmental conditions are
also used to improve the QoS.

All these advantages of RIS architectures and the success
of passive beamforming techniques show a solid commit-
ment to channel knowledge [228]. The acquisition of multi-
hop communication channel
information in RIS-assisted
communication schemes is more complicated than in tra-
ditional massive MIMO systems and can be addressed as an

FIGURE 26. RIS-assisted wireless communication for multiple users.

issue that needs to be studiedThere beside, phase optimiza-
tion algorithms show a strong commitment to the presence
of the perfect channel information at the BS. Yet, acquiring
this channel information can also become challenging due
to hardware limitations, especially in RIS scenarios with
passive reﬂective elements [229].

New scenarios brought by RISs for next-generation com-
munication technologies will create new requirements that
existing architectures will not be able to meet. Apart from the
aforementioned challenges, the optimization of energy con-
sumption of next-generation systems and providing storage
options to meet the high training load of complex systems are
some of the issues that need to be addressed by researchers.
Adaptation performance of RISs to EM signals in radio
environments is one of the major issues that are open to
improvementsFor instance, in RIS-assisted IoT applications,
the number of wireless devices connected to the intelligent
surface can be vast. In such cases, the number of parameters
required for system optimization will increase to the same
extent [230].

Advanced information processing techniques are essential
in the response performance of smart surfaces to EM signals.
This will require additional resources in terms of compu-
tation time and storage, as well as additional energy and
bandwidth [231]. The biggest obstacle in adapting existing
systems to new communication technologies is that analyti-
cal models limit the working ﬂexibility. Analytical modeling
applies not only to network planning in the ﬁrst stage in
scenarios using RISs but also to resource management and
network control where the adaptive approach is used. The
complexity of RIS systems raises the possibility that existing
traditional analytical models may become dysfunctional for
them

Considering the situations mentioned above, uncertainties
arising from RIS system conﬁgurations and channel dynam-
ics complicate the system design [232]. Although signal
processing techniques utilized by conventional RIS models
provide solutions to many communication problems, their
dependence on hypothetical mathematical models causes

36

VOLUME ,

BlockageThe biggest motivation for combining DL techniques
with RIS-assisted wireless communication is the acquisition
of mapping methods that can be unveiled without linear
mathematical models. In this regard, [233] performed a
non-linear mapping between the sent and the received sig-
nals and optimized signal detection with a DL approach.
A DL solution for signal detection proffered by [233],
which contains individual
learned models for each user.
The foremost advantage of this scheme is that no channel
estimation algorithm is required. Nonetheless, this system
needs either beamforming optimization on the BS side or
phase shift optimization directly by the RIS to improve the
BER performance of users.

On the side of channel acquisition, [228] and [234] com-
bined channel estimation scenarios with the DL approach and
performed channel estimation for both reﬂected and direct
paths. The proposed channel estimation technique, which
employs the CNN architecture, is highly dataset dependent.
The diversity of data sets inﬂuences performance efﬁciency,
which can sometimes limit the performance to local dimen-
sions. This causes high training overhead during channel esti-
mation learning. To overcome this problem, [235] created the
architecture of deep denoising NNs, that reduces the training
load. In this model, the intelligent surface contains both
active and passive elements concurrently. This architecture
combines compressed sensing and DL approaches to achieve
greater efﬁciency than either approach alone. However, the
presence of active elements increases hardware complexity.
Assuming that one of the main purposes is to reduce com-
plexity in traditional mmWave massive MIMO architecture,
this can be regarded as an issue that must be addressed.
Integration of DL-based techniques in RIS-aided systems has
been challenging due to complicated training processes since
the number of channels to be exploited is proportional with
the number of reﬂecting elements. Therefore, the literature
frequently focuses on this subject. DL-based channel esti-
mation techniques reducing the training overhead are also
presented in [237], [238], and [239] by different learning
and network architectures. [238] aimed to strengthen the
interaction between channel information and passive beam-
forming of conventional DL-based systems by practicing the
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture. [239] presented a
two-stage channel estimation method to reduce the training
load in mmWave communication schemes. The considered
DNN is trained with a reduced number of users in the
ﬁrst stage to learn effective channel parameters over active
users. Then, the authors present a spatial-temporal–spectral
framework that estimates deﬁcient channel information in
the second phase. [237] used a similar approach, in which
the channel information obtained with only a few active
elements was also used to estimate the remaining channels,
resulting in almost no training overhead. In the ﬁrst part
of the offered two-tier solution, the authors performed CSI
acquisition with the presented sparse channel sensors struc-
ture and then used the obtained information to optimize the

certain drawbacks. Model-independent solutions such as DL
stand out as a convenient solution to combat the aforemen-
tioned uncertainties. In RIS scenarios, the rapid change of
the radio scattering and the hardware impairments result in
certain mismatches, such that signal processing performance
deteriorates. Thanks to its ability to process raw data and
make it meaningful, DL can make a model-independent
mapping by training with learnable parameters [228]. DL
approaches yield more efﬁcient and ﬂexible results compared
to traditional analytical model-dependent methods that are
capable of working under only certain conditions. In other
words, it would not be right to talk about the actual concept
of ”smart surfaces” in a communication environment where
DL or AI approaches are not implemented [17].

In pursuit of the aforementioned advantages of DL-based
approaches, many novel studies have been carried out in
recent years using DL techniques in the ﬁeld of RIS-assisted
communication. This section is ﬁctionalized on channel esti-
mation and signal detection solutions, passive beamforming
design scenarios, and resource allocation in NOMA tech-
niques for RIS-aided DL-based systems. In Fig. 27, the major
applications of DL solutions in RIS-assisted systems are
categorized from the perspective of receiver optimizations
and RIS-side phase conﬁgurations. Finally, we discuss the
actions that need to be taken to compensate for potential
drawbacks of current applications.

A. Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for
RIS-assisted DL-based Systems
Since the number of reﬂecting meta-elements increases in
RIS-assisted massive MIMO systems, the channel acquisi-
tion process becomes more challenging due to the increased
number of channels. In other respects, reliable and accu-
rate channel acquisition carries critical importance for 6G
and beyond technologies. The main inspiration behind DL-
based solutions is balancing the trade-off between system
complexity and achievable rate performance. Therefore, as
can be seen in Table 8, several studies are present in the
literature on channel estimation and signal detection.

RIS phase conﬁguration. However, the presence of these
controlled active elements used in channel reconstruction
cannot practically meet the standalone operation principle
and the passive nature of RISs. The presence of those active
elements also increases the system. [236] has been inspired
by the high learning and prediction capability of DNNs and
aimed low system complexity for mmWave communication.
The proposed deep unfolding method gives higher estimation
performance at lower computational complexity and learning
load compared to the conventional LS estimator. The model-
driven unfolding method, which is a sub-type of DNN and
has the ability to learn from extensive synthetic data with
lower iteration, follows an algorithm similar to traditional
gradient descent optimizations. [240] proposes a novel data-
driven channel estimator in MISO architecture to achieve
reduced system complexity for a similar purpose of [236].
This study beneﬁts from the fact that the CNN structure
involves fewer parameters compared to prior architectures
such as DNN. The proposed CNN-based channel estimator
has superiority over traditional linear estimators in terms
of implementation complexity. Nonetheless, extended sce-
narios, including mobility and plurality of users as well as
multiple antennas assumption, will be vital to realize this
architecture in practical applications.

One of the fundamental motivations for exercising DL
methods in channel estimation is to employ fewer pi-

lots. [241] and [242] presents DL-based approaches achiev-
ing reliability in estimation accuracy while reducing the pilot
overhead. Both studies perform entire channel extrapolation
from sampled channels. [241] proposes sequential trained
three synthetic DNNs. These DNNs ﬁrst estimate the direct
channel and then the cascaded channel. The last DNN
predicts the cascaded channel by using fully passive elements
at the ﬁnal stage. [242] also used multiple DNNs, which
are cascaded and sequentially trained. The proposed study
enhances the conventional element-grouping method by in-
vestigating and eliminating channel interference. Sampled
channels reﬁned by the ﬁrst DNN as a result of interference
elimination are used in the prediction of entire channels in
the second stage. Both studies gain signiﬁcant improvements
in reducing the pilot overhead with reliable channel estima-
tion processes.

Considering the current approaches in the literature, sim-
pler wireless design schemes have been the focus of ongoing
investigations on RIS-assisted systems. In order to measure
the performance boundaries in wireless connections utilizing
RISs, more accurate modeling approaches are necessary
for the transmission of signals scattered by metasurfaces.
Another challenge is that no ampliﬁers are present in an
entirely passive RIS architecture. At that point, RISs might
need a low-powered unit to be informed by current channel
conditions and other communications blocks such as re-

38

VOLUME ,

ceivers or transmitters for the purpose of phase optimization.
Beneﬁting these channel monitoring units embedded with
RISs powered by novel energy harvesting methods might be
necessary for energy-efﬁcient approaches.

As concluded from the majority of recent studies, the
presence of perfect CSI is crucial at the transmitter. Nev-
ertheless, it is not a straightforward process to retrieve full
channel knowledge in practice because of the passive nature
of RIS-aided schemes. For this reason, the quick and accurate
channel acquisition required for next-generation technologies
causes a high training burden. For the present, supervised
learning techniques are commonly employed to tackle chan-
nel issues in order to increase efﬁciency, and DL approaches
investigate CSI structures of current designs. However, due to
the limitations mentioned above, the research efforts can be
expanded with different deployment scenarios. For instance,
using RISs in a near-ﬁeld setting might offer several exciting
applications and beneﬁts.

B. Passive Beamforming Design with DL for System
Optimization
Passive beamforming design is among the most critical
problems for the RIS technology to be included in the
next generation of communication systems. The success
of phase reconﬁguration not only increases the quality of
transformation but also increases the adaptability
signal
of RISs to different communication environments such as
indoor/outdoor applications. Especially in highly dynamic
channels, such as application scenarios with high mobility,
the inadequacy of existing control systems has revealed the
necessity of a new perspective. In preserving the fully passive
nature of RISs with reduced costs and system complexity,
truly intelligent approaches have a bright future for next-
generation communications. Therefore, DL-based passive
beamforming techniques have extensively been addressed
by the literature as presented in Table 9. Current DL-based
studies on RIS-aided communication systems are composed
of various NN structures depending on their advantages for
target applications. MLP, a member of the feed-forward
artiﬁcial-NN and one of the most basic types of DNN, can
be given as an instance. [237] offers an MLP architecture
for beamforming design on the RIS side. The considered
RIS scheme, which has a hybrid structure in which active
and passive elements are present simultaneously, performs
pilot training with randomly distributed active components.
The trained data set, in which the beamforming on the RIS
side is established as an input-output pair, is built with the
supervised learning scheme. The use of active elements can
be considered as a drawback of this study. The possible
advantages of the supervised learning-based MLP algorithm
with fully passive RIS have been inspected in [254] to over-
come the storage and computational performance limitations
in the dynamic positioning of multiple RISs. The MLP-based
NN has fed by dynamic channel information as well as RIS
positioning information. The proposed position-trained NN

results are superior to benchmark results retrieved by an
exhaustive study.

[245] offers beamforming optimization on the RIS side
using the federated learning approach. After the training
phase of the MLP architecture, model updates are calculated
for each user using local data sets. Model updates are
received from the parameter server to which the RIS is
connected. The results of the study indicate that the transfer
overhead is reduced thanks to the federated architecture.
However, because of the passive nature of RISs, the sce-
nario in which it is constantly connected to the parameter
server, makes this architecture inefﬁcient. At that point, [259]
sought a solution to cure unit modulus constraints of passive
reﬂecting surfaces from previous studies and conducted an
approach that also reduces model complexity during the
training phase. This study proposes an unsupervised learning
architecture, in which the direct and reﬂected channels are
the inputs, and the output is the phase values of the response
beamforming of the RIS while the mapping is unveiled.
This architecture is capable of making online predictions
thanks to the trained DNN in the ofﬂine phase. However, the
output parameters are unique for each learning phase. This
contradiction will act as a layer. Therefore, each learning
data will instantly output different values. However, different
methods have been proposed in the literature to prevent
this stratiﬁcation and can be treated as further study on
enhancement of this study.
Deep reinforcement

learning, appears as a promising
method among the DL-based techniques with its high learn-
ing capability and other recent advantages in the decision-
making process. As a result, it also appears as a strong
candidate for various ﬁelds in RIS-assisted next-generation
communication systems. The importance of deep reinforce-
ment learning comes from its remarkable ability to make
inferences from limited knowledge. The literature covers a
wide range of topics, such as providing energy-efﬁcient and
robust processes or extending coverage, but it can primarily
be evaluated at a higher level as passive beamforming
applications.

[232] proposes the deep deterministic policy gradient
(DDPG) technique for a DL-assisted RIS scheme, which
combines the deep-Q network and policy gradient (PG),
where the continuous action space is in use to accelerate the
training phase. The presented model can adapt quickly to
changing channel data and environmental conditions thanks
to the continuous action space of DDPG algorithm. Yet,
using multiple NNs increases the number of parameters in
the learning phase. Therefore, the training overhead will
cause high system load and storage requirements as well as
hardware costs. To overcome the computational complexity
and hardware limitations introduced by multiple NNs, [257]
offers a model combining deep-transfer learning algorithm
and unsupervised learning which requests less sampled data
for the training process. Therefore, results demonstrated that
hardware complexity and training load problems in previous

studies are addressed by this scheme. It is also inspected that
a less transmit power request at the BS side is achieved to
tackle hardware cost and limitations as well as process time.
Here, the DDPG algorithm has also been used by [244]
to optimize and accelerate the learning process. The DDPG
algorithm is responsible for searching the optimum action for
each decision during the network learning phase. Thus, the
learning phase will be accelerated by optimizing the search
space. However, this somewhat contradicts the model-free
nature, which is the main philosophy of the DL approach,
as the learning process will require an optimization toolbox
and signal models for the learning process. At this point,
instead of optimization-based techniques, it would be more
appropriate to follow methods using completely deep model-
learning approaches. To compensate model-
independent
dependent structure of current deep reinforcement learning-
DDPG applications, [250], [229], and [248] proposed their
advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques making the
systems robust in changing environmental conditions. By
these advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques, not
only the channel information but also channel behavior can
be learned similar to [258]. [250] has achieved a higher
SNR for noisy channels and mobile scenarios compared
to conventional deep reinforcement learning methods. The
authors of [248] demonstrated that their algorithm could
enhance the BER performance in every cycle thanks to the
evaluation of previous rewards for actions, so that enhance
optimization of the phase matrix. The channel behavior
can be interpreted by evaluating historical line-of-sight path
channels to determine optimal phase conﬁguration for further
actions.

[229] developed an active learning scheme that adapts
rapidly to changing environmental conditions while main-
taining high performance. However, since reinforcement
learning works with a reward mechanism, it has a longer
operation time and lower performance compared to super-
vised learning. The fact that the considered scheme does not
have a layered structure causes it to lag behind supervised
learning performance. However, [255] has demonstrated that
a design outperforming supervised learning in terms of both
energy and time consumption can be created without the use
of a layered structure. The proposed algorithm with trained
NNs by the approach of deep unsupervised learning opti-
mizes both energy expenditure and phase conﬁguration to
outperform even the Genetic algorithm, which is considered
a groundbreaking development in optimization. That being
said, this improvement comes with a slight loss in throughput
performance compared to the genetic algorithm. However,
that loss can be compensated with an increased number of
antennas.

Unsupervised learning has also been used to optimize
computational complexity. In [260], efﬁcient relay selection
optimization is performed with low system complexity by the
proposed algorithm. On the other hand, [251] outperforms
previous deep reinforcement learning-based techniques in

terms of computational complexity for complicated phase
shift optimization scenarios by creating direct relation be-
tween optimization parameters and throughput. The relay se-
lection method is also conducted to reduce propagation loss
over increasing distance by the proposed deep reinforcement
learning model that can learn from the environment.

Propagation loss is also the subject of terahertz com-
munication which has a bright future for next-generation
communication systems. [252] seeks a method that addresses
the challenge in path loss optimization for RIS-aided tera-
hertz communication which has high molecular absorption
and attenuation. The proposed method implementing hybrid
beamforming provides 50% coverage extension compared to
ZF and alternating beamforming.

In addition to prior applications, joint optimization of
transmission power with phase shift conﬁguration by deep
reinforcement learning in RIS-assisted systems provides ma-
jor advantages for optimizing achievable rates and achieving
an energy-efﬁcient system. [253] performs resource alloca-
tion optimization for device-to-device (D2D) networks. The
proposed scheme conducts a proximal policy optimization
algorithm to deﬁne the policy gradient of deep reinforcement
learning that seeks the maximized reward. The presented
model outperforms the random phase shift matrix selec-
tion algorithm with random relay selection and maximum
power transmission algorithm that also performs phase-shift
conﬁguration optimization in terms of achievable rate and
computational time performance. The great reward achieved
by [253] in which the deep reinforcement
learning was
involved, was enhanced by [231] in an energy-efﬁciency
manner. [231] has aimed to present a fully energy-efﬁcient
method by optimizing the ON/OFF state of RIS elements
besides transmit power. In this scheme, the access point
receives available energy information from CSI in order to
make the best decision for the current state via a backhaul
link that connects the RIS to the BS. [229] terminates the
necessity of controlling RIS from any infrastructure in order
to introduce standalone operation. The proposed study shows
that RIS is capable of learning and adjusting optimal relay
selection using the proposed deep reinforcement learning
approach with almost no training overhead, thanks to the
online learning phase.

Advanced DL applications also promise intelligent en-
vironments in the case of mobile user scenarios for RIS-
assisted communication systems. [243] used the DL ap-
proach in phase conﬁguration on the RIS side and developed
a process that yields user location-dependent results. An NN
using the location information as input is trained for many
reference points to give optimized phase outputs. In other
words, this study offers an efﬁcient method for conﬁguring
an RIS in the indoor communication environment. The
ﬁngerprinting database in the training of weights and biases
forms the concept of location-based learning, which unveils a
mapping between measured user location and RIS unit cells
to maximize the received signal strength. Nevertheless, both

OZPOYRAZ et al.: DEEP LEARNING-AIDED 6G WIRELESS NETWORKS: A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF REVOLUTIONARY PHY ARCHITECTURES

the inefﬁciency of RIS positioning and the inefﬁcient result
in the throughput must be investigated.

[247] used the DL approach to optimize the phase
conﬁguration on the RIS side, trained feedforward NN with
reﬂected symbol signals and aimed to obtain the optimum
phase matrix. The facts that the system cannot superior the
least square estimation methods for high symbol powers and
causes high signaling overhead are the points that need to
be addressed. Also, the system should be analyzed under
the assumption of imperfect channel estimation. However,
channel acquisition is a signiﬁcant challenge in RIS-assisted
schemes due to complicated channel
information caused
by a large number of reﬂective elements. Therefore, [256]
and [230] proposed approaches unveiling a direct mapping
between optimal phase conﬁguration and achievable rate.
[230] uses the pilot signals in the DNN trained by an unsu-
pervised learning approach to determine the optimal phase
conﬁguration instead of using it in the channel acquisition.
The proposed algorithm bypassing the channel prediction
process requires fewer pilots compared to prior studies
with channel estimation. In [256], the considered ML-based
approach leveraged by DL techniques has no need for initial
CSI for direct mapping. The proposed algorithm is capable
of learning the relation between RIS conﬁguration and
achievable rate correlated with dynamic receiver positioning.
Since [256] is one of the studies that give the closest results
to the benchmarks with the perfect channel assumption, the
proposed method gleams as a bright future direction so that
RIS shift optimization can be executed without the need for
perfect CSI from the infrastructure.

Following a different perspective from prior studies, [249]
concentrates on the advantages of the RIS architecture for
the ﬁeld of PHY security. This study intends to optimize the
secrecy rate at the receiver by tuning meta elements on the
RIS side. Therebeside, real-time tuned reﬂecting elements
allow phase conﬁguration optimization on the RIS side using
the DL approach and this proposed a technique that yields
similar outcomes to traditional methods but at the same time
reduces the computational complexity considerably.

Considering these studies and the rest of the literature,
we conclude that the results obtained in combining RIS
architectures with DL approaches do not adequately meet the
ﬂexibility and required performance for 6G and beyond wire-
less communication systems. In particular, the limitations are
presented by both the transmitter and the user perspectives,
such as the high computational complexity, the high training
overhead, and the perfect CSI assumption in the transmitter.
Besides, the use of active elements on smart surfaces in
optimizing the phase conﬁguration does not comply with
the fully passive nature of RISs. The urgent need to achieve
high energy efﬁciencies at the lowest possible cost should be
considered. It is clear that the literature still contains many
gaps that require work in light of these problems. Examina-
tion of different RIS positioning scenarios, optimization of
system performances over computer simulation, and appli-

cation scenarios under different environmental conditions,
in which the DL approach enhances channel estimation
and phase conﬁguration optimization, is vital in designing
promising perspectives on related research problems for 6G
and beyond.

Another technical limitation that makes current system
designs less viable is the assumption of a static environment.
Though, in dynamic scenarios, the mobility of users includes
some additional parameters such as speed, acceleration,
and position that need to be considered in the process.
Therefore, the learning process for the data trafﬁc of a mobile
user becomes more complicated due to dynamic channels.
Moreover,
the system parameters cannot be speciﬁed as
constants because of the inﬁnite amount of mobility. This
situation makes it challenging to employ supervised tech-
niques in which input-output pairs are labeled and learned
from properly arranged data. Considering the beneﬁts that
ML techniques provide in the face of complex data in various
ﬁelds, methods such as computer vision or neural language
processing can also be regarded from the perspective of
communication engineering. At this point, structures such
as convolutional neural networks may be preferred instead
of more superﬁcial DNN structures.

RISs are comprised of complex formed subwavelength
elements. As a consequence, a fundamental restriction in
continuing RIS research is the lack of accurate and con-
trollable models that deﬁne reconﬁgurable metasurfaces as
a function of their EM features. As the majority of studies
assume, the passive reﬂection behavior of RISs is not appli-
cable in practice. Components such as material composition,
polarization, and angles inﬂuence the RISs response to radio
waves. In other words, RISs do not just reﬂect the waves but
also re-design them. For RIS topologies, practical EM-based
circuit designs should be used, which take mutual linking and
unit cell conﬁgurations into account, similar to [261].

C. DL Techniques for Resource Allocation in RIS-aided
NOMA Systems
NOMA stands out as another promising technique for in-
creasing the efﬁciency of future massive MIMO systems.
Therefore, NOMA-MIMO techniques have been studied
extensively in the literature to examine how to improve the
spectrum and energy efﬁciency required by 6G and beyond
technologies and to increase the total capacity of multiple
users [262]. Thus, NOMA sparkles as a promising solution
for challenging ﬁelds of 6G communication systems such as
massive IoT that require high data capacity and lower latency
with high spectral efﬁciency. Fig. 28 illustrates an RIS-
assisted downlink-NOMA scenario where the users having
correlated channels are clustered together. Effective cluster-
ing schemes with individuals having minimum correlation
with other clusters are provided to conduct efﬁcient resource
allocation and enhanced throughput while decreasing inter-
ference.

alignment to cope with growing network trafﬁc by [264].
The proposed method aims to perform passive beamforming
optimization on the RIS side with the ML algorithm. By
this approach, they sought an optimized solution for signal
decoding, power allocation, and user clustering under QoS
constraints while the MISO-NOMA downlink scheme is
considered for the proposed network. A novel Deep Q-
network algorithm is adopted in the regulation of the power
allocation process and the phase conﬁguration on the RIS
side.

The advantages of handling clustering techniques with
intelligent approaches are also studied and discussed in RIS-
assisted scenarios by [246], [265], and [266]. In an RIS-
assisted NOMA communication scheme, [246] optimized the
phase conﬁguration using the deep reinforcement learning
approach, thus aiming to increase the spectrum efﬁciency by
developing a deep reinforcement learning approach solution
for resource allocation. The authors of this work also propose
multiple clustering schemes providing by the BS under the
dynamic number of users assumption for MISO scheme.
A novel Deep-Q network-based algorithm is introduced for
the phase matrix conﬁguration and power allocation. The
proposed algorithm is superior to the benchmarks such as
traditional RIS-assisted orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
systems.

Thanks to the reward mechanism in Deep reinforcement
learning, [266] used a structure that can adapt to the dy-
namic number of users presented by [246] to learn the
channel behaviour. [266] proposed a long-term stochastic
optimization technique aiming to maximize the sum rate for
multiple user NOMA downlink communication. They aimed
at joint optimization of phase conﬁguration on RIS side and
user clustering. The proposed DDPG-based optimization is
also capable of taking optimal action for dynamic states by
various scenarios. This makes it possible to learn and apply
long-term policy for conﬁguring phase shifting as well as
user clustering. The presented algorithm has optimized the
sum data rate of mobile users, outperforming the results
of traditional OMA technologies. However, compared to
conventional OMA solutions, the high system complexity
and high training load created by NOMA schemes are
an issue that needs to be addressed. [265] proposed the
relaxation-then-quantization method that addresses the prob-
lem of optimizing the balance between system complexity
and performance. This study combined the over-the-air fed-
erated learning algorithm with a RIS-assisted hybrid network
and developed a ﬂexible method that can adapt to different
channel conditions. The presented study performs resource
allocation by optimizing the transmitter power and phase
conﬁguration on the RIS side while meeting different QoS
requirements. It is aimed to maximize the potential hybrid
rate by performing these joint optimizations.

High training overhead created by NOMA schemes is
also addressed by [267] aiming to optimize total system
capacity for the absence of CSI, using an approach similar

FIGURE 28. RIS-assisted downlink-NOMA with multiple clusters.

Besides all

the aforementioned advantages of NOMA,
DL approaches will be critical in improving existing sys-
tems to meet
the high-performance system requirements
of next-generation perspectives. In the most general sense,
the studies aimed at improving the performance of existing
NOMA systems using the DL approach can be catego-
rized under the detection of channel characteristics and
SIC. Power optimization, user clustering, signal detection,
decoding techniques, and phase conﬁguration can be cited
as the main areas where the DL approaches are employed to
improve existing NOMA schemes. Since DL approaches are
vital in increasing the performance of traditional RIS-assisted
NOMA systems, numerous studies have been carried out in
relevant areas as presented in Table 10.

In the current NOMA literature, the intelligent system
approach with DL has been mainly seen in user clustering
scenarios that have already been studied extensively due to
their critical role, as mentioned earlier. [263] provided a new
idea about possible contributions of intelligent approaches
in next-generation communication systems by presenting the
effect of the DL approach integrated into a conventional RIS-
assisted NOMA architecture. The proposed study presents a
user clustering algorithm that reduces computational com-
plexity and creates the optimum power allocation with
sequential decoding. The study, which designed a K-means-
based ML algorithm for user clustering, beneﬁted from the
correlation in the user channels of mmWave systems. So
the proposed K-means-based algorithm also has the ability
to do online user clustering. This characteristic allows it to
outperform traditional K-means-based algorithms in terms
of performance in lower system complexity. Therebeside,
a conventional K-means-based Gaussian mixture model is
conducted as a clustering technique used to interference

the performance degradation of imperfect SIC on the user
data rate was studied. As a result of the parametric study,
it was determined that the SIC imperfection rate grew ten
times causing the decline of the system performance by 10
When the current RIS-aided NOMA literature is consid-
ered, it is evident that the existing studies are insufﬁcient in
terms of system complexity, energy efﬁciency and adaptation
capability to different channel conditions required by 6G
and beyond communication technologies. In particular, the
high complexity of the systems and optimization problems
has pushed the current practical studies to single antenna
system assumption. Therefore, performance improvement of
the RIS-assisted NOMA in MIMO systems emerges as a
subject that needs to be addressed. In RIS-NOMA scenarios,
imperfect SIC adoption is the main factor that degrades
system performance and limits the number of users. Consid-
ering the current literature, it is evident that SIC techniques
using conventional optimization algorithms are insufﬁcient to
obtain adequate performance. For this reason, novel grouping
techniques have been developed and applied such as [242].
However, the development of advanced interference cancel-
lation processes seems as a bright future for next-generation
NOMA architecture. Advanced DL approaches for SIC opti-
mization will undoubtedly increase the performance of RIS-
assisted NOMA systems.

VI. PHY Security Meets DL
In this section, we present an overview of DL-based PHY
security studies. For this purpose, ﬁrstly, the PHY secu-
rity concept will be brieﬂy introduced and DL-based PHY
security methods will be categorized for their attack type:
spooﬁng, jamming, and eavesdropping. In each subsection,

our investigation results will be presented with explanations
and comparisons.

Wireless communication is highly vulnerable to malicious
attacks at PHY as a result of the open nature of the wireless
channel. Since the channel is accessible by any party, an
adversary can easily interfere with legitimate communication
at PHY. Traditionally, a countermeasure for PHY attacks is
designed at upper layers, e.g., network or transport layers.
However, traditional methods are often resource-inefﬁcient
or might have limited protection in 6G networks or emerging
IoT applications. Therefore, providing effective countermea-
sures against PHY attacks is an open problem.

In the past years, many researchers focused on PHY
security methods to tackle this problem. These methods are
essentially based on exploiting PHY attributes for security
purposes. Although PHY security shows great promise, it
implemen-
also holds signiﬁcant challenges for practical
tations. With the emergence of DL networks, researchers
sought DL-based PHY solutions to overcome existing chal-
lenges or further improve security performance. Readers are
referred to Table 11 for a list of related survey papers in this
ﬁeld.

We believe that an effective categorization for DL-based
security studies would be based on the attack types. The
most common three attack types (spooﬁng, jamming, and
eavesdropping) are illustrated in Fig. 29 can be deﬁned as
follows.

• Spooﬁng: In spooﬁng attacks, the adversary (Eve) aims
to imitate the identity of the legitimate transmitter
(Alice) such that the receiver (Bob) thinks that the
message is sent from Alice.

• Jamming: In jamming attacks, Eve aims to block legit-
imate communication by introducing jamming signals
to the channel such that Bob obtains highly distorted
signals.

between Alice and Bob. (c) Eavesdropping: Eve aims to obtain the
messages that are sent from Alice.

• Eavesdropping: In eavesdropping attacks, Eve seeks
to obtain the message sent from Alice by simply
eavesdropping the channel.

In the rest of this section, DL-based PHY solutions
against these three fundamental attacks are presented with
comprehensive comparisons.

A. Anti-Spooﬁng Solutions
In traditional communication systems, authentication algo-
rithms are widely employed as a countermeasure against
spooﬁng attacks. The authentication algorithm relies on the
fact that Alice owns a prior information that indicates her
authenticity. On the receiving side, Bob uses an algorithm
(a detection/classiﬁcation process) to check if Alice has
this information. Although traditional methods are very
effective at classifying non-authorized users, delivering prior
information to Alice securely or keeping it secure is a
highly vulnerable step. In PHY security methods, the role
of prior information is transferred to channel or device
characteristics that are unique to the location, time, or device.
As a result, PHY authentication methods are able to catch
attackers even if Alice’s credentials are leaked. However,
selecting practical features from the channel and designing
the detection process is a challenging task. Recently, DL

networks are implemented to overcome these challenges and
improve detection accuracy. A list of the DL-based PHY
authentication methods is given in Table 12 with their pros
and cons.

ML-aided PHY authentication is ﬁrst introduced by Xiao
et al. in [280]. The study considers a common PHY au-
thentication scenario where the receiver applies a binary
hypothesis test based on the received signal strength indica-
tor (RSSI) values. The decision mechanism ﬁrst calculates
the test statistics, i.e., the normalized distance between the
received RSSI value and a reference one. Secondly, test
statistics are compared with a threshold to decide if the signal
is spoofed or not. Here, the selection of the threshold is a
critical step that directly affects the detection performance.
As the main contribution, the authors propose a Q-learning-
based threshold selection algorithm. The algorithm basically
searches the action and state planes to ﬁnd the threshold
that maximizes the Q-function2. The authors also investigate
the performance of the proposed algorithm using USRP

2Q-function calculates the expected reward of an action in Q-learning
algorithms. Q-learning or other reinforcement learning algorithms optimize
their objective by maximizing a reward value. The reward values are
calculated by trial-and-error since the system is unsupervised (i.e., labeled
data does not exist). In larger problems, Q-function is often approximated

with DL algorithms.

modules. Test results indicate that a dynamic threshold selec-
tion with Q-learning outperforms ﬁxed threshold selection.
In [281], the authors extend their previous work in [280] to
include Dyna-Q learning method. In addition to the results
of [280], experiments reveal that Dyna-Q model can improve
both learning speed and authentication performance com-
pared to Q-learning. The authors also consider the MIMO
scenario in [282] by extending the algorithms given in [281].
The results show that both using reinforcement learning and
increasing the number of antennas improve the detection
performance.

The most signiﬁcant drawback of [280]–[282] is that the
receiver is assumed to know reference RSSI values for the
detection mechanism. This assumption is dropped in [283]
by generating a decision result with logistic regression.
Speciﬁcally, the receiver uses previous RSSI information
to train a logistic regression model and estimates the au-
thenticity of the current RSSI value. As a result, the pro-
posed method is able to detect spoofers successfully without
prior RSSI information, even under dynamic and unknown
channel models. On the other hand, the study considers a
network where the receiver obtains RSSI information from
multiple spatially distributed nodes (landmarks) with mul-
tiple antennas to improve detection performance. In [284],
the authors extend their work by reducing the computational
overhead of the regression model. USRP experiments verify

that the logistic regression-based decision mechanism can
successfully detect spoofers under unknown channel models.
DL is introduced to PHY authentication by the authors
of [273]–[276] simultaneously and independently in 2019.
Also, another independent study [277] was published in
2020. In [273], a MU mobile edge network where a node
aims to authenticate packets coming from multiple users
is considered. The authentication system exploits past CSI
values that are obtained with pilot transmission to discrim-
inate unauthorized nodes. Instead of applying a traditional
hypothesis test, the decision task is given to a CNN. As a
challenging task, the receiver requires that the authentication
of a node should be within the coherence time of the last
CSI that is used in the training process. When the coherence
window expires, the receiver updates its CNN parameters
with a new training process. The authors present a compre-
hensive investigation of the proposed method where various
algorithms are tested for their training speed. Simulation
results show successful detection rates even with very small
training data sizes. Also, simulation results are veriﬁed with
USRP modules in a real-world test environment.

Similar to [273], the authors of [274] and [275] consider a
PHY authentication method where the receiver node obtains
packets coming from multiple nodes. These studies are
mainly based on the same idea and differ from each other in
terms of CNN structure and performance analysis. In [274],
staying in a coherence window is not considered. Instead,

46

VOLUME ,

the study focuses on the impact of the PHY attributes that
are used to extract features. Also, the study includes SNR
investigation and lacks practical implementation. In [275],
the authors implement a DNN, a CNN and a preprocessing
added CNN model. The study gives a complete investigation
of these three models in terms of computational complexity,
training time, transmitter number, hidden layer number, an-
tenna number, and authentication accuracy. Although DNN
model gives the best authentication rates, the proposed pre-
processing added CNN model achieves close results with less
computational complexity. Also, the study presents USRP
implementations to verify the practical feasibility of the
proposed models.

The authors of [276] consider a three-node network that
includes a transmitter, a receiver, and an eavesdropper.
Similar to [273] and [274],
this study exploits wireless
channel features as input of a DNN in order to identify
spoofers. This study distinguishes from [273] and [274] by
thoroughly implementing and investigating CNN, RNN and
convolutional RNN models. The RNN model is shown to be
able to capture the spectral dependencies and improve detec-
tion performance. Moreover, the convolutional RNN model
can further improve the detection performance by cascading
CNN and RNN models. This work also proves the superiority
of DL on PHY authentication with numerical comparisons
to traditional Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing.

In [277], another DL-based PHY authentication method is
proposed. Similar to [276], this model consists of a single
legitimate transmitter and exploits channel characteristics.
Also, this study considers adding newly obtained CSI data
to the training dataset as used in [276]. In simulations, this
adaptive approach is compared with a non-adaptive scenario
(i.e., new data is not added to the training set). The results
prove the superiority of the adaptive approach. This work
differs from [276] by its DNN structure and its investigation
of non-line-of-sight scenarios.

In [278], the authors consider a mmWave MIMO scenario
where channel characteristics are highly sensitive to spatial
location. For this purpose, the authors propose a novel chan-
nel feature to improve the detection accuracy of mmWave
MIMO networks. The proposed channel feature is used in
two spooﬁng detection mechanisms: i) traditional Neyman-
Pearson hypothesis testing, ii) feed-forward NN. Hypothesis
testing is considered for static channels that have constant
channel correlation. The feed-forward NN is considered for
dynamic channels with varying channel correlations. It has
been shown that
the proposed new channel feature can
improve detection performance for both static and dynamic
channel models. This work differs from previous DL-based
approaches by its novel channel feature and its focus on the
channel correlation level.

Although we can not compare the models of [273]–[278]
with the same system parameters, the authors of these works
state that their methods can achieve 97% detection accuracy
rates at their peak training time.

One of the biggest drawbacks of DL-based models is
the requirement of large datasets. It is a known fact that
the performance of DL models can signiﬁcantly drop with
limited data. In order to overcome this problem, data aug-
mentation methods have been proposed in DL literature. Data
augmentation techniques are mainly based on generating
artiﬁcial data from the existing dataset. The limited data
problem of PHY security DL networks has been considered
by Liao et al. in [279]. Liao et al. previously worked on DL-
assisted PHY authentication in [275]. In [279], the authors
argue that wireless networks are especially vulnerable to
limited data as a result of channel coherence time. Hence, the
authors propose three data augmentation methods to improve
the training speed and authentication accuracy. Also, the
authors perform experiments on real-world datasets to verify
their results.

The majority of studies in the literature consider the
application of DL at the legitimate side (i.e., to improve
security). In [285], the authors take the opposite view and
investigate DL-assisted spooﬁng attacks. In particular, this
study focuses on OFDM systems that are deemed secure
against spooﬁng attacks. Simulation results show that data-
driven spooﬁng attacks are able to effectively disrupt OFDM
systems that are traditionally considered secure.

DL-based anti-spooﬁng methods are proved to be highly
beneﬁcial when compared to traditional
threshold-based
detection mechanisms. DL models learn the best decision
mechanism from data when traditional methods suffer from
the problem of threshold selection. An inaccurate threshold
selection in a mathematical detection model can easily lead
to high miss detection or false alarm rates. Moreover, DL-
based methods in the literature are able to deal with large
networks where authentication of multiple nodes is required.
Creating a DL model that classiﬁes multiple nodes simulta-
neously is possible. On the other hand, the greatest challenge
of DL-based anti-spooﬁng methods is to obtain information
on the spoofer. DL-based methods require training data to
generate a model that can distinguish between a spoofer and
a legitimate user. However, including any information from
the spoofer to the training data is not practical. Unfortu-
nately, current studies include the spoofer’s channel in the
training process to train their models. This assumption is
a critical drawback on implementing DL-based methods in
real scenarios.

B. Anti-Jamming Solutions
Jamming attacks can dramatically disrupt the communication
between Alice and Bob since Alice’s signals easily become
unrecognizable when superimposed with the jamming signal.
Traditionally, spread spectrum techniques are implemented
jammers. Frequency hopping schemes aim to
to combat
dodge jammers by continually changing the communica-
tion frequency. Direct sequence spread spectrum methods
spread the communication to a larger bandwidth to reduce
the impact of the jamming signal. Designing an efﬁcient

frequency hopping pattern is an open issue and is considered
by many researchers. In the last decade, various efforts
have been made to leave the design step to a DL network.
Since continuously dodging a jammer over a spectrum is
a sequential game where Alice makes its hops depending
on new observations, reinforcement learning is a powerful
candidate to improve performance. Table 13 contains several
DL-based anti-jamming studies that exist in the literature
with their pros and cons.

One of the ﬁrst examples of learning-based anti-jamming
approaches can be seen in [293]. The study considers a
wireless network that consists of two competing teams. Each
team consists of a jammer and a receiver node, where each
jammer node tries to interrupt the communication of the
opposing team’s receiver while each receiver node aims to
avoid the jammed frequencies. The authors propose various
Q-learning approaches to select the frequency hops of a
receiver node and the target frequencies of a jammer node.
The proposed approach assumes that each node has spectrum
sensing capabilities and each team has control channels
for receiver-friendly jammer communication. The authors
investigate the performance of Q-learning methods against
conventional methods and each other.

The accuracy of the Q-learning-based detection results can
be insufﬁcient in high-dimensional data, and the learning
speed can increase dramatically. In order to capture non-

linear relations in the data and increase both learning speed
and accuracy, DL-based jamming detection models have
been proposed in [286]–[288], and [289]. These studies
essentially focus on DL techniques to ﬁnd an efﬁcient fre-
quency hopping strategy. In [286], a cognitive radio network
is considered where the secondary user applies a deep
Q-learning network (DQN) to avoid jammed frequencies
while not interfering with the primary users. The proposed
model uses Q-learning to decide on the jammed frequencies
and select the appropriate frequency band. The Q-function
is calculated with a CNN to improve accuracy and time
complexity. Q-learning states are calculated based on the
received SNIR values (features extracted to avoid jammed
frequencies) and the primary user occupation information.
The proposed method does not require knowledge of the
jammer or channel model. As a result, it is applicable to any
environment. Computer simulation results show that CNN-
based Q-learning yields higher learning rates than traditional
Q-learning methods. Also, the receiver attains higher SNIR
values.

A similar anti-jamming approach is considered in [287].
Contrary to [286], the method does not assume that the
jammer follows the same transmission slot structure of
the legitimate communication. Also, this method uses raw
spectrum information to feed CNN instead of using extracted
features. In [288], Q-function is approximated with double

48

VOLUME ,

deep Q-learning. [288] can be distinguished from [286],
[287] by their double DQN choice instead of DQN. Although
double DQN is shown to be more stable than DQN in the
literature, [288] only compares their method with traditional
Q-learning and lacks any comparison with DQN. As a
strong side, the authors implement three types of networks:
fully connected network, CNN and long-short-term-memory.
The authors of [289] improve the results of [288] by
implementing double DQN with a more efﬁcient network
model. Speciﬁcally, the authors exploit transformer encoder
to implement double DQN and obtain improved results com-
pared to CNN-based double DQN. Unlike previous studies,
in [294], DL is used for receiver design. Speciﬁcally, a DL
algorithm is implemented at the receiver of a continuous
phase modulation scheme in order to improve the prediction
of the received signals under single or multi-tone jamming
attacks. Numerical results showed that DL assisted receiver
can improve BER performance of the system by 3 − 5 dB
under single-tone jamming attacks.

Detection of the jammer type is an important step for
anti-jamming communications. Instead of focusing on avoid-
ing the jammed frequencies (which primarily considers Q-
learning), the detection of jammer type focuses on identi-
fying jammer features. Conventional model-based methods
ﬁrst convert raw information into features using mathemat-
ical models and solve a classiﬁcation problem to identify
jammer types. Applying DL in this process can signiﬁcantly
overcome the inaccuracies of mathematical models. In [290],
the authors proposed a CNN-based jammer identiﬁcation
method which imitates the image processing applications of
DL. This method ﬁrst converts one-dimensional data into im-
age format in order to train the network. Although simulation
results indicate 92% accuracy for identifying three jammer
types (single-tone jammers that use Gaussian noise with
different mean and variance), this study lacks comparison
with any benchmark model. An improved detection model
is proposed in [291] where a simpliﬁed Le-Net5 CNN model
is used. In the performance evaluation, the authors include
multi-tone jammers. The method achieves 92% accuracy
(which is similar to [290]), yet the authors remark that the
method attains a higher learning speed. As major drawbacks,
this study lacks comparison with a benchmark model and
assumes an ideal
the jammer can
instantaneously shift frequencies.

jamming pattern,

i.e.,

The above studies mainly focus on either avoiding the
jammer with frequency hopping or identifying the jammer
type. In [292],
the authors focus on both concepts by
ﬁrstly identifying the jammer type and then proposing an
efﬁcient frequency hopping pattern. The proposed method
ﬁrstly sweeps the time domain and captures multiple frames
of spectral energy (i.e.,
two-dimensional spectral energy
information in a time interval). The frames are fed into a
CNN to identify the jammer type. In the next step, traditional
Q-learning is used to provide a frequency hopping pattern.

As an important contribution, the authors also consider the
cost of frequency hops in the system model.

An overview of the DL-based anti-jamming literature is
presented in Table 13. These studies mainly focus on improv-
ing the reinforcement learning model with DL assistance.
Based on our investigations, we conclude that DL can im-
prove the frequency hopping accuracy of anti-jamming sys-
tems and bring robustness against unbalanced environments.
Although most of these studies include extensive computer
analyses, the literature heavily lacks proof of concepts or
testbed implementations with real-world datasets.

C. Anti-Eavesdropping Solutions
Encryption/decryption methods are the conventional coun-
termeasures against eavesdropping attacks. An encryption
method requires secret information (key) shared by only
Alice and Bob. The security of an encryption method is based
on the assumption that Eve is unable to decrypt the message
without the key. However, this assumption can be falsiﬁed
with high computational power. Moreover, distributing the
key to Alice and Bob without leaking it to Eve is a major
drawback of the conventional encryption methods. Instead of
hiding the message inside a cipher, PHY security methods
aim to prevent Eve from correctly obtaining the messages
at PHY. For this purpose, PHY security methods focus on
various techniques such as coding, BF, or artiﬁcial noise to
nullify Eve’s channel. However, designing an effective model
for these techniques is a challenging task and still draws
the attention of many researchers. In the past years, various
DL-assisted models have been proposed in the literature to
improve the secrecy rate. A list of the reviewed DL-based
anti-eavesdropping methods is given in Table 14 with their
pros and cons.

E2E learning with AEs is an emerging concept

that
can signiﬁcantly improve communication rates under un-
predictable environments. The success of AEs on commu-
nication drew the attention of wireless security researchers
in the past years. A direct implementation of AEs for the
secure communication purpose is presented in [295]. The
main idea of the study is to include a security objective
to the loss function of an AE. In other words, the loss
function does not maximize only the legitimate channel; it
also aims to minimize the eavesdropper’s channel. However,
this objective as the difference between Bob and Eve’s
channel capacity is hard to compute. For this reason, the
authors implement this objective as a modiﬁed version of
the difference in cross-entropy losses. The method uses
clusters that contain redundant symbols to confuse Eve. The
proposed loss function enables the users to choose the level
of the information loss in the legitimate channel (and the
leaked information to Eve as a trade-off). As a strong side,
Eve is considered to have NN abilities. The main drawback
of the study is that Eve is assumed to have more noise than
Bob. Another secure AE model is proposed in [296]. Similar
to [295], the authors consider the design of a secure loss

function based on cross-entropy. As an addition, [296] also
implements an authentication method into the AE.

In [297], the authors use DL to generate wiretap codes.
The main idea behind the study is to include the error rates
of the eavesdropper into the loss function of the AE. The
study successfully analyzes the problems of implementing
this idea and presents a thorough mathematical basis. Also,
the design allows a trade-off between information leakage
to the eavesdropper and BER of the legitimate receiver. The
authors also verify their theoretical results with computer
simulations by comparing their scheme with polar wiretap
codes. A similar approach is also considered in [301].
Contrary to [297], this study constrains their alphabet to
BPSK and uses a different loss function.

A secure communication model for MIMO networks is
proposed in [298]. Instead of focusing on E2E communica-
tion, the proposed DNN aims to ﬁnd the optimum covariance
matrix of the input signal. The DNN is fed with a large
dataset containing input channels and covariance matrices in
ofﬂine training. Compared to conventional analytical solu-
tions, DNN-based covariance matrix approximation reduces
the time-complexity. Also, it is a practical solution to power
and time-restricted applications since the computational load
is at the ofﬂine training stage.

DL-aided secure communication for cognitive radio net-
works is ﬁrst considered in [299]. In addition to the tra-
ditional secure communication objective function, the pro-
posed method includes two additional constraints: i) transmit
power of the secondary user should be under a threshold,
ii) leaked interference to the primary user should be under
a threshold. The authors exploit a DL network to approxi-

mate the best transmit power allocation scenario for secure
transmission with given cognitive radio constraints. Also, the
method is able to ﬁnd a solution to the optimization problem
even without CSI. This study thoroughly compares the
proposed method with conventional optimization techniques
for their secrecy rate performance, leaked information to
the primary user, and computation time. Their results show
that DL can heavily reduce the computational
time and
complexity without any signiﬁcant performance loss.

In [300], D2D communication networks are considered.
The authors propose a DL-assisted algorithm, which selects
the transmit antennas and the device pairs in order to prevent
pairing with eavesdroppers.

DL-based anti-eavesdropping studies are listed in Ta-
ble 14. Most of these works are based on utilizing AEs
to ﬁnd secure encoding or BF schemes. Since traditional
methods are model-based,
they are highly vulnerable to
unexpected variations in the environment. On the other hand,
DL-based anti-eavesdropping literature proves that the data-
driven nature of DL networks can signiﬁcantly improve the
robustness against unexpected variations.

One of the challenges that DL literature faces is to include
the eavesdropper’s channel capacity in the loss function.
Contrary to the spooﬁng or jamming scenarios, DL-based
anti-eavesdropping methods do not face a classiﬁcation prob-
lem. Essentially, the DL models are expected to optimize
their variables for the secrecy rate metric which includes the
eavesdropper’s channel capacity. However, known DL mod-
els and loss functions are not fully applicable for this task.
As a result, unique DL models are still needed to improve the
performance of DL-based methods. Similar to anti-jamming

literature, we should remark that anti-eavesdropping studies
lack proof of concepts and testbed implementations with
real-world datasets. Moreover, DL-assistance is applied to
a limited number of communication scenarios, i.e., RIS or
OFDM scenarios are missing. The following section dwells
on the future aspects of our four leading research directions
and presents our comments.

VII. Conclusions and Future Directions
As we have often stated, we are on the verge of a poten-
tial revolution in wireless communications. The deployment
process of the 5G technology has come a long way all
over the world these days and the active research on the
6G technology has also gained tremendous momentum. It is
an undeniable fact that 6G technology will usher in radical
paradigm shifts, new thrilling applications, and groundbreak-
ing technologies. AI will undoubtedly play a huge role in
this irresistible revolution emerging with 6G. Speciﬁcally,
DL approaches have been building a concrete ground and
will most likely continue to overtake other AI branches for
the bright future of wireless communication technologies. In
this article, we have provided a comprehensive overview of
the existing DL-based PHY techniques and shed light on
the huge potential of emerging DL approaches under four
main research directions toward 6G, namely massive MIMO
systems, MC waveform designs, RIS-aided communications,
and PHY security. We have analyzed the progress made so
far in detail and determined major future research directions
in each of these ﬁelds, as demonstrated in Fig. 30. Please
note that it is possible to add other PHY research directions
to the framework that we have covered in this article. In fact,

the usage of DL grows gradually on other PHY technologies.
For instance, the literature also includes DL-powered studies
on mmWave or terahertz communications. It has been shown
that DL can be employed to efﬁciently solve various chal-
lenges of high-frequency communications. Moreover, DL is
also applied for the challenges of drone or unmanned aerial
vehicle communication networks. However, the DL literature
on these technologies is still developing, and including them
in our 6G framework is a future direction.

A. Future Directions on Massive MIMO Systems
We have investigated the major developments of DL applica-
tions for MIMO systems from various aspects and identiﬁed
the missing points that should attract more attention. The
ﬁrst issue from an intelligent receiver perspective is that
most detectors available in the literature require perfect CSI
to operate successfully. Since it is challenging to estimate
channels in practice and even harder in massive MIMO
systems due to their plenty of transmit antennas, developing
a system model with a perfect CSI assumption remains
a pipe dream. Therefore, receiver frameworks based on
DL techniques composing channel estimators and symbol
detectors should become more common in the future to
support practicability. Secondly, evaluating the proposed
models in a computer simulation environment using generic
channel model assumptions may be deceptive since there are
many more impairments in real-life scenarios, and we do
not know how they impact the performance of DL models.
Thus, we suggest creating benchmark channel datasets that
include real-life impairments and encapsulate diverse settings
for various wireless communication standards, such as 5G

and Wi-Fi 7. These benchmark datasets will allow for fair
comparisons of DL models. Apart from these, the third vital
topic for rapid progress in this ﬁeld is the development
of benchmark system models that researchers can compare
their DL models. The number of novel DL frameworks
has been increasing in tandem with the advancement of
the literature. Hence, new DL-based frameworks should be
compared to existing novel data-driven methods to prevent
the conglomeration of similar models.

In terms of intelligent transmitter designs and E2E per-
spectives, our initial advice is to concentrate solely on MU
system models that require MU interference cancellation
since almost all communication systems have been serving
MU cases for a while. Thus, DL-based precoders should not
only eliminate the effect of the channel on each user but
also prevent a user’s signals from interfering with others.
The second point is practicability, as in the case of DL-
based receiver designs. We believe that experiments using
SDR testbeds in various environments will help us examine
the feasibility of DL-based models in dynamically changing
scenarios. It is also possible to understand the hardware
requirements for efﬁcient DL operations. The last research
direction is the actual enabler of the PHY revolution. Consid-
ering DL approaches’ ability to optimize a communication
system as a whole in an E2E fashion, we question if the next-
generation wireless communication technologies can arise
without the restrictive standardization process that requires
continuous regulations. The ultimate objective is to delegate
deﬁning parameters, signaling, and other issues that must
be resolved throughout the standardization process to DL
networks, therefore shortening the time between generations.

B. Future Directions on Multi-Carrier Waveform Designs
Various MC waveforms are proposed by researchers and
OFDM has emerged as the most popular one among them.
As noted earlier, OFDM has been used in modern wireless
communication systems including 4G and 5G. Although
designed on top of OFDM, other MC waveforms such as
FBMC and GFDM could not seize the throne. Despite
OFDM being the most powerful one due to its simplicity
and ﬂexibility, other OFDM-based waveforms can also be
seen as candidates for 6G wireless networks. Nonetheless,
these waveforms are still needed to be improved to meet
the high demands of 6G. At this point, DL comes into the
picture as a great tool in order to enhance performance and
reduce the complexity of MC waveforms.

In the second step, we have reviewed emerging DL-based
solutions for various MC waveforms. With a comprehen-
sive assessment, we conclude that the existing DL-based
methods have great potential to improve the performance of
the aforementioned waveforms for 6G and may outperform
traditional algorithms. However, there are still unaddressed
issues related to the application of DL-based solutions for
MC waveforms. Firstly, most studies focus on optimizing
only one performance metric such as BER and PAPR.

However, in MC systems, there are multiple key performance
indicators, which should be considered while designing the
system. Therefore, we believe that it is important to design
DL-based techniques that optimize multiple performance
metrics jointly to improve the overall performance. Secondly,
while designing a target DL method, speciﬁc requirements of
different 6G applications, such as eMBB, URLLC, mMTC,
and their possible combinations, need to be considered.
Thirdly, most studies in the literature focus on enhancing
the performance of classical OFDM. Designing DL-based
techniques for other MC waveforms is still an open topic.
Fourthly, the combination of AE-based NNs with IM to
increase the data rate or improve error performance would be
an interesting design problem. Lastly, we observe that most
of the proposed DL-based solutions have not considered real-
world data sets. In order to reveal the true potential of DL-
based techniques, they need to be implemented in practical
scenarios by employing wireless communication testbeds.

C. Future Directions on RIS-Aided Physical Layer
Communications
Considering the needs of 6G and beyond wireless com-
munication technologies, it is vital to reduce the overall
system complexity by preserving the passive structure of
RISs and achieving high performance at a low cost. Thus,
it may be crucial to consider the advantages of optimal RIS
positioning. In light of the aforementioned approaches, the
question of how effective RIS conﬁguration should be in DL
assistance in order to get the best performance will arise.
In line with these approaches, applicable RIS positioning
scenarios can be evaluated for effective signaling and channel
estimation at the user side, reducing signaling overhead and
optimizing the transmit power.

In Fig. 31, we provide four major RIS deployment scenar-
ios. As shown in Fig. 31(b)-(c), an RIS can be deployed on
the BS side or the receiver side, or it can be positioned in a
hybrid scheme as in Fig. 31(d) to combine its advantages in
certain aspects. It appears as the most advantageous option
in terms of signaling overhead due to the close distance
between the RIS and the BS so that the channel in between
is almost static. This also eliminates the coordination burden
when compared to distributed RIS deployments on the user
side. The BS-side positioning has the ability to adapt to
instant changes in user channels and different QoS require-
ments. On the ﬂip side, compared to the BS-side deployment,
it provides a more advantageous solution in providing a
direct LOS in user-side RIS positioning. This is shown as
the only aspect where user-side deployment is superior to the
BS-side in [302]. However, this situation can be treated as an
issue that can be improved with the DL approach. Then, BS-
side deployment scenarios might gleam as bright solutions
for optimizing DL-assisted RIS applications. Similarly, ap-
propriate positioning by using intelligent surfaces as virtual
access points in which BS-side positioning, might match
the power of an active access point by using fully passive

hybrid-side positioning.

to observe the variation of system performance according
to changing environmental conditions and to determine the
optimum working policy, it is vital to create dynamic user
scenarios for the BS-side RIS deployment. Thereby, a long-
term policy with the ability to learn for dynamic scenarios
can be constituted. By an approach similar to [243], in a
scenario, as given in Fig. 32, a DNN that performs the RIS
phase conﬁguration with various position information can be
considered. Thus the signal level at different user positions
can be increased effectively with DL.

DL approaches also have great signiﬁcance in enhancing
the performance of downlink NOMA-MIMO systems and
increasing the overall system performance in terms of user
sum-rate. In this way, lower system complexity and power
consumption can be addressed, which will enable beyond 5G
wireless communication technologies. Positioning scenarios
while preserving the passive nature of RISs can also be
considered here ﬁrst. In DL-based studies on RIS-aided
downlink-NOMA schemes, a common predicament arises
with the assumption of having an initial CSI. However, ob-
taining CSI in a NOMA system scheme is another challenge
due to the complexity of the underlying communication
model. These schemes might be integrated with RNN-like
DL approaches that estimate channel state using channel
statistics, aiming to reduce latency in scenarios without
initial CSI. Furthermore, the assumption of imperfect SIC
at the decoding stage makes preventing MUI difﬁcult with
the increasing number of users. This is one of the most
critical factors degrading the total user performance due to
the inefﬁciency of current SIC techniques and restricting user
capacity. Inspired by [304], the combination of a novel DL
approach seeking the perfect SIC with DL-assisted RIS phase
optimization can address the aforementioned challenges in
scenarios using the downlink-NOMA scheme. Novel DL
algorithms suitable for these scenarios can be tested with
DNN or CNN architectures and appropriate loss functions
can be developed.

As another direction to leverage novel DL methods, si-
multaneously transmitting and reﬂecting RISs (STAR-RIS)
can be considered as a ﬁeld that has a gleaming future.
By simultaneously transmitting and reﬂecting the incident
signals, STAR-RISs may serve both sides of users placed
at their front and back, in contrast to RISs, which are often

FIGURE 32. A location-based trained indoor application.

elements. These virtual access points increase environmental
scattering and provide spatial multiplexing gain to the MIMO
system as in [303]. However, the assumption of the presence
of initial CSI can be considered as a drawback in these
the development of a DL-based
systems. At
approach eliminating the need for initial CSI will provide
signiﬁcant gains in performance.

this point,

BS-side RIS positioning, as seen in Fig. 31(b), and the
creation of virtual APs on the BS side may play an essential
role in reducing signaling overhead and system complexity
on the transmitter side. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 31(d),
the hybrid positioning scenario should be investigated to see
if it yields more appealing results than BS-side positioning
due to the optimization burden caused by increasing system
parameters. At
this juncture, a novel DNN architecture
can be used in the learning process of a high number of
parameters for the estimation of the complex channel infor-
mation brought by the hybrid positioning scenario. These
scenarios can be combined with a DL approach similar
to [247] and phase optimization on the RIS-side can be
placed with a model-independent and trained DNN. In order

distinguished by their reﬂecting-only property.The concept of
STAR-RISs has been extensively elaborated by researchers
in utilizing the unique communication framework to pro-
duce smart radio settings, which has been motivated by
its appealing advantages [305], [306], [307]. Nevertheless,
the fractional shape of the objective function and non-
convex restrictions make it difﬁcult
to solve the energy
efﬁciency maximization problem by locating the global op-
timal solution. DL can be considered as a potential solution
to overcome the difﬁculties posed by current optimization
methods.

D. Future Directions on Physical Layer Security
In the ﬁnal step, we have put our emphasis on emerging
PHY security systems. The existing studies in the literature
prove the positive impact of DL on PHY security. Although
various network or attack models have been considered
in the past, there are still scenarios where the impact of
DL has not been tested. For example, the secrecy capacity
of OFDM-IM/OFDM systems or RIS-assisted networks is
widely considered in the literature. However, exploration
of the impact of DL on these scenarios is still an open
area. Moreover, the existing literature is very immature such
that mostly raw ideas are considered. Their extensions to
different DL networks and various system models (e.g.,
power/complexity constraints, improved attacker models) are
missing and, we believe, is an interesting future direction to
unlock the potential of DL.

To sum up, we conclude that DL architectures might
have a huge potential to shape the PHY design of future
radios, and challenging open problems exist to unlock the
true potential of AI-based approaches for future wireless
systems.
