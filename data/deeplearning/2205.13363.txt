The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is the most damaging pathogen
of soybeans in the United States. To assess the severity of nematode infestations in the
field, SCN egg population densities are determined. Cysts (dead females) of the nematode
must be extracted from soil samples and then ground to extract the eggs within. Sucrose
centrifugation commonly is used to separate debris from suspensions of extracted nema-
tode eggs. We present a method using OptiPrep as a density gradient medium with
improved separation and recovery of extracted eggs compared to the sucrose centrifugation
technique. Also, computerized methods were developed to automate the identification and
counting of nematode eggs from the processed samples. In one approach, a high-resolution
scanner was used to take static images of extracted eggs and debris on filter papers, and a
deep learning network was trained to identify and count the eggs among the debris. In the
second approach, a lensless imaging setup was developed using off-the-shelf components,
and the processed egg samples were passed through a microfluidic flow chip made from
double-sided adhesive tape. Holographic videos were recorded of the passing eggs and
debris, and the videos were reconstructed and processed by custom software program to
obtain egg counts. The performance of the software programs for egg counting was charac-
terized with SCN-infested soil collected from two farms, and the results using these methods
were compared with those obtained through manual counting.

Introduction

Many nematodes (microscopic roundworms) are soil-dwelling plant parasites that infect the
roots of plants and cause billions of dollars of crop loss worldwide on an annual basis. Hetero-
dera glycines, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), is the most damaging soybean pathogen in the
United States and Canada, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in crop loss annually [1]. The
SCN infects the roots of soybeans and siphons nutrients from the plants, leading to stunted

growth and reduced crop yields. The amount of damage and yield loss caused by the nematode
is related to several factors, including the number of eggs (egg population density) in the soil.
Knowing the SCN population density in the soil can be useful in guiding the use of management
strategies and assessing the success of management efforts in SCN-infested fields.

To determine the population density of SCN in a field, one or more multiple-core soil sam-

ples are collected. On a sample-by-sample basis, the cysts (egg-filled dead SCN females) are
extracted from samples, and the eggs are extracted from the cysts, then counted using a micro-
scope. Two methods commonly used to extract nematode cysts from the soil are (i) wet sieving
and decanting, and (ii) elutriation. Wet sieving and decanting [2] involve suspending soil in
water, agitating the suspension, allowing the heavier soil particles to settle to the bottom of the
container, and pouring the suspension through two sieves. The top sieve (usually with 850-
μm-diameter pores) will capture root fragments and other debris, which will be discarded, and
the bottom sieve (usually with 250-μm-diameter pores) will capture nematode cysts and cyst-
sized debris. Smaller debris (<250 μm in diameter) will pass through both sieves and be dis-
carded. For the elutriation method, soil is suspended in a column or cone of upward-flowing
water. Heavy soil particles remain near the bottom of the flowing water suspension, while cysts
and less dense objects float and pour out of the top of the column or cone to be captured on
sieves [3] as with the wet-sieving and decanting method.

Currently, two methods commonly used for extracting eggs from nematode cysts are (i) by

grinding the cysts in a plastic or glass tube with a stainless-steel pestle [4] or Teflon tissue
homogenizer and (ii) by grinding the cysts on a 250-μm-pore sieve with a rubber stopper [5].
Both methods result in the capture of eggs and similarly sized debris on 25-μm-pore sieves.
Accurately and efficiently counting the eggs to determine the population density can be diffi-
cult and inefficient when considerable amounts of debris are recovered with the eggs. Separat-
ing the eggs from the debris often is necessary to make counting possible. Also, it is desirable
to separate and discard debris from eggs in suspension when the eggs are to be used in labora-
tory experiments, such as when assessing development and studying hatching of nematode
juveniles from the eggs [6–8].

Sucrose centrifugation [9] is a method commonly used to separate plant-parasitic nematode

juveniles and eggs in suspension from debris. Although sucrose centrifugation is inexpensive
and easy, it may not be the most efficient method and it may have adverse effects on the nema-
todes. Exposing nematode eggs and juveniles to sucrose solutions, with a high osmotic potential,
may harm the eggs and juveniles if exposure to the sucrose is prolonged. Also, if the nematodes
are not thoroughly rinsed with water following centrifugation in sucrose solution, sucrose resi-
dues may remain and promote bacterial and fungal growth on the eggs and juveniles. Deng
et al. [10] suggested an alternative density gradient method to sucrose centrifugation using an
iodixanol solution, OptiPrep™ (also known as Visipague™ in medical uses). Testing the effects of
a single concentration of OptiPrep™, they found that the efficiency of extraction of the reniform
nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) and post-extraction mobility of the recovered nematodes
were both 100% greater than when the sucrose centrifugation method was used.

Following the extraction and cleaning of egg samples, the eggs are counted to determine the
population density of nematodes. Counting is completed manually through microscopic obser-
vation, requiring trained personnel. The process is time intensive, laborious, and prone to
human error. It would be ideal if this portion of the process could be automated to address these
shortcomings. Furthermore, automated egg counting could reduce labor costs and processing
fees compared to manual counting methods where the expense increases with sample quantity,

The objectives of this work were: 1) to develop a method of purifying eggs from suspension
with debris and 2) to develop new methods to automate counting of eggs once extracted from
cysts and purified. In the first counting approach, a high-resolution scanner takes images of

the processed sample (i.e. stained eggs with debris) dispersed on filter paper that was then run
through deep learning algorithms to automatically identify and count the eggs. In a second
counting approach, a benchtop, lensless imaging setup takes real-time, holographic videos of
the processed sample passing through a flow chip and is analyzed with a custom software pro-
gram to determine the egg count. We performed detailed characterization of the new methods,
while attempting to minimize the number of manual steps.

Materials and methods
Sample preparation

Soil samples were collected from two fields in Muscatine and Story County in Iowa. The fields
were located on research farms owned and operated by Iowa State University. No specific per-
missions were required to obtain the soil because the purpose of the farms and their fields is to
support crop research, and collection of soil samples is a routine part of conducting such
research. The field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. The sample prepa-
ration involved two steps: egg extraction and egg staining.

To extract the eggs, each soil sample was poured in a bucket filled with water (approxi-
mately 2 liters), mixed thoroughly, and allowed to settle. The soil suspension then was poured
through a 20-cm-diameter sieve with 850-μm-diameter pores above a 20-cm-diameter sieve
with 250-μm-diameter pores [2]. The debris and egg-filled cysts (dead nematode females)
were collected on the 250-μm-pore sieve and then transferred to a 3.7-cm-diameter, 250-μm-
pore sieve and were crushed using a motorized rubber stopper to release the eggs [5]. These
eggs (along with similar sized debris) were collected on a 15-cm-diameter sieve with 37-μm-
diameter pores and then transferred into a microwavable container [11].

For staining the eggs, a stain solution was prepared by adding 3.5 g acid fuchsin (F8129,
Sigma Aldrich) and 250 mL glacial acetic acid (ARK2183, Sigma Aldrich) to 750 mL of distilled
water and stirred well [4]. One drop of the stain and four to five drops of 1 M HCl solution
were added to each plastic beaker containing the eggs. The beakers and their contents were
heated in a microwave for 15 seconds to stain the eggs [12].

Sample cleaning method using OptiPrep™-based centrifugation
Fig 1A is a schematic representation of the protocol for sample cleaning using OptiPrep™ as
the density gradient medium. The protocol consists of two steps: centrifugation and separa-
tion. During the centrifugation step, 3 mL of the density gradient medium (OptiPrep™) at a
specific volume percentage was put in a 15 mL centrifuge tube (Corning™). Thereafter, 5 mL of
the stained egg sample was pipetted on top of the OptiPrep™ solution, forming an emulsion
interface layer between the solutions of different densities as shown in Fig 1A(i.). The com-
bined sample was centrifuged at 840 G for 2 minutes. Particles with higher density than the
gradient solution passed through the emulsion layer and were deposited in a pellet at the bot-
tom. Particles with comparable density to the gradient solution were concentrated in the inter-
face layer, while particles having lower density floated in the top layer of the solution. The
contents of the centrifuge tube were categorized into three layers: top (4 mL), interface (2 mL),
and bottom (2 mL). In the separation step, each of the three layers were pipetted into three dif-
ferent 15 mL test tubes and diluted to 11 mL with water, as shown in Fig 1A(ii.).

centrifugation and separation. i) An illustration of the density gradient centrifugation is shown where the three distinct layers (top, interface, and bottom) were visible after
the centrifugation step. ii) The three layers were separated and diluted with water to 11 mL. b) A scanner-based egg counting method is shown where three solutions were
dispersed on separate filter papers, allowed to air dry, and then placed face-down on an A4-sized (21.6 × 27.9 cm) transparency sheet. The filter papers were scanned at
4800 dpi and analyzed by a deep learning network model to obtain a count of the eggs. c) The lensless setup consisted of a light-emitting diode (LED) to illuminate the
processed sample flowing through a microfluidic flow chip and a CMOS image sensor to record videos of the eggs in real-time. A custom software program, written in
Python, analyzed the videos and produced the egg count.

after centrifugation in OptiPrep™ were poured on separate circular filter papers (Grade 41, What-
man™, 90 mm diameter) and allowed to air dry at room temperature (approximately 22˚C). The
filter papers were placed on an A4-sized (21.6 × 27.9 cm) transparency sheet face-down and
placed on a flatbed scanner (Epson Perfection v750 Pro) connected to a desktop computer. Using
the scanner software (Epson Scan software, Version 3.921), each piece of filter paper was selected
with a bounding box and scanned as shown in Fig 1B. The following settings were chosen: reflec-
tive scanning mode, 4800 dpi, and 24-bit color. All other imaging parameters were set to their
default values. The scanned images were saved as JPEG files to the computer hard drive.
Data collection and pre-processing. Each scanned image of the filter paper

(17759 × 17759 pixels) was split into 4900 patch images (256 × 256 pixels). The colorspace of
each patch image was converted from RGB (Red, Green and Blue) to HSV (Hue, Saturation,
and Value) to distinguish the different colors because the HSV colorspace separated the color
information (chroma) from the image intensity (luma). A range of HSV values was selected to
identify objects of a similar color to the stained eggs within the patch image. Then by applying
thresholds on the object’s physical dimensions (i.e. width, height, shape, and area), all of the
eggs were detected in the patch image. A label image with the eggs was created and stored
along with the patch image on the hard drive. The above process was repeated for all the patch
images, and subsequently used for training and testing the deep learning network. The patch
and label images were resized to 128 × 128 pixels to reduce the number of training parameters
and model size. The pixels were normalized to ensure that all of the features were given equal
importance. The total data set consisted of 60 filter paper images from 20 different soil

samples, yielding 294,000 patch images, which were randomly divided into training and test
data sets (80:20 split) to be used to develop the deep learning model.

Deep learning network architecture. To automatically learn the features related to the
SCN eggs from patch and label images, we have employed a convolutional autoencoder network
—a specific type of autoencoder network that used convolutional layers [13,14]. In general, a
‘convolutional network’ is composed of four layers: convolution, activation, pooling, and drop-
out layers. The convolution layer had neurons with weights and biases, which were updated after
every iteration by a backpropagation algorithm in the training process. The activation layer con-
sisted of a non-linearity function and performed mathematical operations on the input. An
example activation function is the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and has been shown to greatly
accelerate the training process [13]. The pooling layer performed non-linear down-sampling on
the input image by extracting the maximum or average of all the non-overlapping sub-regions in
the image. This layer reduced the number of training parameters and memory footprint of the
network. The dropout layer selected a random set of neurons determined by a percentage proba-
bility and set their inputs to zero making them unusable in the decision-making process of the
network. Besides the convolutional network, the ‘autoencoder neural network’ presented an
unsupervised learning platform to provide an approximate mapping of the inputs and outputs. It
consisted of the ‘encoder’ and ‘decoder’ paths. The ‘encoder’ path compressed the input informa-
tion by downsampling and learned important features, while the ‘decoder’ path reconstructed an
approximate higher dimensional output utilizing upsampling operations.

A schematic of our network architecture is shown in Fig 2, which is a modified version of
the U-Net convolutional autoencoder model [15]. We added dropout layers to prevent overfit-
ting, replaced unpadded convolutions with padded convolutions to avoid cropping operations,
and replaced the soft-max activation with sigmoid activation. We reduced the feature maps to
half of the original size, which decreased the number of parameters.

As shown in Fig 2, the deep learning network took 3-channel RGB patch images as inputs
and produced 1-channel grayscale label images as outputs. The network consisted of nine layers;
each layer had two convolutional layers and a max pooling layer. In the ‘encoder’ path, each
step performed repeated convolutions with a 3×3 kernel followed by ReLU activation function
and a 2×2 max pooling operation. In addition, the fourth and fifth layers contained dropout lay-
ers with probabilities of 0.4 and 0.3, respectively. The filters were doubled as the downsampling
operation was performed to move to the next layer. The number of filters started from 32 in the
first layer and extended up to 512 in the fifth layer. Thereafter, the ‘decoder’ path was initialized
wherein, at each step, an upsampling operation and 2×2 convolution was performed and fol-
lowed by concatenation of the corresponding feature map from the ‘encoder’ path. Then, simi-
lar to the step in ‘encoder’ path, repeated convolutions with a 3×3 kernel followed by ReLU
activation was performed. A final 1×1 convolution and sigmoid activation was performed to
map the label image. Details of our deep learning model are listed in S1 Appendix.

Training and testing the deep learning network model. The patch images and their cor-

responding label images were used to train the network with Adaptive Moment Estimation
(ADAM), which is a type of stochastic optimization of cross entropy loss [16]. In total, the net-
work had 7,760,097 trainable parameters and was processed using an NVIDIATM Geforce
GTX 1070 Ti graphics processing unit (GPU) with 8 gigabyte memory and 2432 CUDA cores.
The batch size was set to 32 and the training was performed for 100 epochs. The model imple-
mentation was written in Python using Keras [17] and Tensorflow [18] libraries.

The test dataset comprising the patch images was run through the above trained model and

the corresponding grayscale images were generated. A thresholding technique yielded binary
images which were passed through a blob labelling algorithm to get the egg counts in the patch
images [19].

Lensless imaging method

Hardware and software components. Fig 1C shows the setup for the lensless egg count-
ing. The basic principle of lensless imaging is discussed elsewhere [20], and has been used to
image microscopic objects such as cells, bacteria, and even nematodes without the need for
expensive microscopes. Our lensless imaging hardware consisted of the lighting, imaging, and
processing modules. (i) The lighting module comprised a light emitting diode (LED, wave-
length λ = 616 μm, Vishay Intertechnology) that was aligned with a 100 μm pinhole (Edmund
Optics) and sealed within a pinhole mount. This arrangement allowed the light from LED to
be emitted through the pinhole producing spatial coherence [20]. The LED was connected in
series with a 60 Ω resistor and is powered by the 5 V GPIO (general purpose input/output) pin
on the Raspberry Pi (RPi) 3 Model B board. Fig 3A shows the wiring diagram. (ii) The imaging
module comprised a Pi camera (8 MP) with a CMOS sensor. The default housing of the cam-
era was removed using a standard razor blade to expose the CMOS sensor. Fig 3A shows the
camera connected to the CSI (camera serial interface) port on RPi. (iii) The processing module
comprised a portable RPi microcomputer having a 1.2 GHz 64 bit central processing unit
(BCM2837), 1 GB random-access memory, and a built-in Wi-Fi unit. The RPi ran on the
Raspbian Jessie operating system (Debian “Jessie” based/Linux kernel) loaded onto a 64 GB
microSD card (SanDisk™). Camera support was enabled in the settings, and open-source video
streaming software was installed to access the live video feed remotely [21]. The RPi was pow-
ered by a micro USB wall-mount power supply (5 V, 2.1 A). A 3-D rendering of the platform
that housed the various modules is shown in Fig 1C and the platform served to reduce interfer-
ence from ambient light. The platform was printed on a 3-D printer (da Vinci 1.0 Pro, XYZ-
printing) using a Polylactic acid filament (1.75 mm diameter, XYZprinting).

pin of RPi was connected to the anode of the LED while the ground pin from RPi was connected to the 60 Ω resistor. The cathode of the LED was connected to the other
end of 60 Ω resistor. b) (i) An illustration of the microfluidic flow chip is shown. The microfluidic flow design was cut on a piece of double-sided tape using a cutting
machine, and the tape was bonded to a microscope slide. A transparency film with input and output accesses was cut and adhered to the top side of the tape. Two circular
tape pieces with holes cut in the center were attached to the fluid ports and placed around the access holes in the transparency sheet. (ii) A diagram of the assembled
microfluidic flow chip is shown with all of the layers bonded together. Scale bar = 20 mm.

After sample cleaning as described earlier, 1 mL of the processed sample was loaded in a 3
mL syringe (BD Biosciences) and connected to a syringe pump (KDS-100, KD Scientific). The
standard needle of the syringe was replaced by a dispensing needle (16 gauge5.08 cm, Howard
Electronic Instruments) to avoid clogging. The syringe was positioned vertically and taped
with a vibratory motor (3 V/60 mA, 6500 RPM, Jameco Reliapro) to prevent settling of debris
in the tubing. The 3.3 V GPIO pin was used to power the vibratory motor. A plastic tubing
(inner diameter: 16 gauge) dispensed the processed sample from the syringe to a microfluidic
flow chip. The RPi was turned on and video recording was enabled as the eggs and debris
passed through the flow chip. Another piece of plastic tubing was connected to the output port
to direct the processed sample into a waste reservoir. After all of the processed sample passed
through the flow chip, the video recording was terminated.

Design of the microfluidic flow chip. The microfluidic flow chip was intended to be
made using low-cost and simple-to-use materials and tools, thereby eliminating the need for
micromachining or microfabrication techniques such as photomask design, lithography, spin
coating, developing, curing, and etching. The flow chip comprised three layers: the base, chan-
nel, and cover layers. A microscope slide (25 × 75 × 1.0 mm, Fisherbrand™) served as the base
layer. The channel layer was designed and cut from double-sided tape (25 × 75 × 0.2 mm, 3M™).
The cover layer was constructed from a transparency sheet (Apollo™). Initially, commercial soft-
ware (Studio™, Silhouette America) was used to create the design of the microfluidic flow chan-
nel (1.4 × 50 × 0.2 mm) with a central imaging chamber (2.1 × 2.4 × 0.2 mm). The different
layers are shown in Fig 3B(i). Double-sided tape was attached to the cutting mat and loaded
into the cutting machine (Cameo™, Silhouette America) to cut the flow channel onto the tape.
The cut tape was then removed, aligned, and bonded to the base microscope slide. The design
of the cover layer had holes for an inlet and an outlet which were aligned with the ends of the
flow channel. The same cutting process described above was used to create the cover layer in a
transparency sheet, which was placed and bonded to the channel layer. PDMS ports were used
as input and output ports and sealed to the transparency film using circular rings of double-
sided tape as shown in Fig 3B(i). The assembled flow chip is shown in Fig 3B(ii).

Data collection and pre-processing. The videos recorded from the RPi were recon-
structed using a custom software program written in Python. As shown in Fig 4, the program
loaded one video at a time and read all frames sequentially. The objects of interest (eggs) in a
frame were identified by subtracting the current frame from the previous frame and filtering
the noise using a median filter. This step eliminated any static content in the current frame
including imperfections in the flow channel, settled debris, and image noise. Only the moving
objects remained after this step, including eggs and debris. The resultant image was in a binary
format with object pixels colored in white against a black background. From the binary image,
different physical dimensions (i.e. width, height, shape, and area) of the identified objects were
determined and compared with those of a typical SCN egg. This helped identify if the selected
object was a SCN egg. The process continued until all of the detected objects in the image were
validated. The program then read the next frame and repeated the process until the final frame
was reached. Thereafter, the total SCN egg count was reported for the processed sample.

Principle of reconstructing holographic images. The spatially incoherent light from the
LED passed through an aperture resulting in a partially coherent light called the reference wave
UR(x, y, z). The reference wave illuminated the objects located at distance z1 in the channel of
the flow chip. The incident light was scattered to generate the object wave UO(x, y, z). The
interference between the reference wave and object wave produced holographic patterns. The
intensity I(x, y, z) of the holograms at a vertical distance Z is described in Eq 1 [22]:

Iðx; y; zÞ ¼ jURðx; y; zÞj2 þ jUOðx; y; zÞj2 þ UR

�ðx; y; zÞUOðx; y; zÞ þ URðx; y; zÞUO

�ðx; y; zÞ ð1Þ

The first and second terms in Eq 1 represented the background and scattered light intensity.

The scattered intensity is generally weaker than that of the background. The third and fourth
terms represented the interference maxima and minima [22]. The CMOS sensor was placed at
a distance z2 from the light source (z2 > z1) and recorded the intensity of the holograms
[20,22]. However, the phase information was lost, which made it difficult to discern objects
from a digital holographic image.

Digital reconstruction algorithms were used to convert the holographic image to a micro-
scope-like image. The reconstruction commonly known as ‘holographic reconstruction’ con-
verted the holographic image in the object plane to the detector plane. For our application, we
have used the Fresnel diffraction method which utilized a single Fourier transform (F ) to back

propagate the wave a distance z = z2 –z1 to the reconstruction plane, Uz(x, y, z). Eq 2 describes
how the reconstruction plane was obtained by Fourier transforming the element-wise multi-
plication of image intensity and combining it with a Fresnel approximated transfer function
and a phase term. This operation can be written as [23]:

approximate phase was obtained using the Fresnel approximation. There are other techniques
to recover the phase that involve taking multiple images of the same object by varying parame-
ters such as wavelengths, angles of the LED, and z values [24,25]. Some other techniques use
iterative methods to retrieve the phase. These alternatives are also effective but require addi-
tional imaging components and computations.

Results
OptiPrep™-based density gradient centrifugation
A qualitative analysis of the debris distribution was performed to characterize the effects of
OptiPrep™ during the centrifugation step. Using the protocol described in Fig 1A, different
OptiPrep™ solutions (0%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 80% by volume) were used. Images of the
centrifuge tubes before and after the centrifugation step were taken for the different OptiPrep™
solutions and cropped as shown in Fig 5 (i,ii). The three layers were separated after centrifuga-
tion, diluted with water to 12 mL, and put on separate filter papers. Fig 5 (iii) shows a plot of
the mean pixel intensity levels as a function of distance along the center axis of the tube. In
these plots, the orange and purple lines denote the mean pixel intensity levels before and after
the centrifugation step, respectively.

step using OptiPrep™ resulted in a marked visual separation of the debris. Before centrifuga-
tion, the tube had a relatively consistent debris distribution (Fig 5 Control i.) whereas after
centrifugation, all of the suspended debris were concentrated into the pellet at the bottom of
the tube (Fig 5 Control ii.). Since the control sample did not contain the OptiPrep™ solution,
there was no distinct interface layer. Here the mean intensity plots before and after centrifuga-
tion are similar because no OptiPrep™ solution was present (Fig 5 Control iii.).

With 20% OptiPrep™, there was a clear contrast between the images of the tube before (Fig
5 20% i.) and after centrifugation (Fig 5 20% ii.). The mean pixel intensity plot showed a defini-
tive change at the interface before and after centrifugation (Fig 5 20% iii.). The interface layer
for 40% and 50% OptiPrep™ appeared visually similar to that of the 20% concentration. How-
ever, with increasing OptiPrep™ concentrations (60% and 80%), there was a noticeably increas-
ing amount of debris trapped at the interface layer both before and after centrifugation (Fig 5
60% i.-ii. and Fig 5 80% i.-ii.). This separation of debris at the interface layer was consistent
with the mean color intensity plot (Fig 5 80% iii.).

Scanner-based method: Egg recovery in the interface layer

Each image of the filter paper corresponding to a different OptiPrep™ solutions (20%, 40%,
50%, 60%, and 80%) was run through a custom software program, written in Python, to iden-
tify the nematode eggs and give a count of the eggs within the image. The program initially
takes a full image of the filter paper and then partitions it into patch images and sub-patches to
identify and count the eggs. Fig 6A and 6B show representative images of two filter papers hav-
ing an uncleaned sample and a cleaned sample, respectively. In both cases, the program was
able to differentiate stained eggs from the debris.

For a given volume of the processed sample, the total SCN egg count was obtained by com-
bining the egg counts for the top, interface, and bottom layers. The egg recovery ratio was cal-
culated as a ratio of the egg count in each of the three layers to the total egg count as depicted
in Fig 7. This was repeated for four processed samples (n = 4). The average egg recovery ratio
and standard deviation were plotted for the top, interface, and bottom layers corresponding to
the different OptiPrep™ solutions.

and after (purple) centrifugation. The different OptiPrep™ solutions used were 0%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 80% by volume. The control (i.e. 0%
OptiPrep™) does not have an interface layer, and so the supernatant is treated as the top and the pellet as the bottom layer. All test tubes pictured were 15
mL tubes.

The graph in Fig 7A shows that the egg recovery ratio in the top layer was negligible after
the OptiPrep™ sample cleaning as virtually no eggs were found in this layer. In the interface
layer, the egg recovery ratio improved with increasing OptiPrep™ concentration and
approached 95% for the case of the 80% concentration of OptiPrep™. Meanwhile, the egg
recovery in the bottom layer decreased with increasing OptiPrep™ concentrations and
approached 4% for the case of the 80% OptiPrep™ solution. For the remaining studies with
OptiPrep™, the 50% OptiPrep™ solution was used as the egg recovery at the interface layer was
greater than 80% and the sample purity was the highest. Beyond an OptiPrep™ concentration
of 50%, sample purity started to decrease as was demonstrated by the increase in material
remaining at the interface layer after cleaning (Fig 5 60% ii.).

The graph in Fig 7A shows that most eggs were recovered from the interface layer of the cen-
trifuge tube after sample cleaning with OptiPrep™. Fig 7B tabulates the average percentage of egg
recovery at the interface layer for the associated volume percent OptiPrep™ solutions (n = 4). The
spatial distribution of eggs in the images of the filter papers (corresponding to the interface layer)
are shown as raster plots in Fig 7C. Four extraction runs were conducted, each with a fresh batch
of extracted and stained SCN eggs and a pre-specified OptiPrep™ solution. The raster plots show
the distribution of the SCN eggs (denoted as dark pixels) across the 324 sections of the images
generated by the software. The raster plots show that the eggs (or dark pixels) were distributed

across most of the filter paper, which helped facilitate the identification of individual eggs. Com-
paring the raster plots for 20% OptiPrep™ with those of higher OptiPrep™ concentrations, the ras-
ter plots appear darker as the OptiPrep™ concentration increases, suggesting that the egg
recovery ratio increased in the interface layer as OptiPrep™ concentrations increased.

Performance of sample cleaning methods: OptiPrep™ versus sucrose
The OptiPrep™ sample cleaning method was compared with the sucrose centrifugation tech-
nique, which is the conventional method of separating nematodes and eggs from debris [26].
The samples were treated as described in Fig 8(A). A stock sucrose solution was made by dis-
solving 454 gm of sucrose in 1 L of tap water. Approximately 500 cm3 of SCN infested soil was
manually processed (using techniques in the ‘Sample Preparation’ section) to extract the SCN
cysts, then eggs and debris. The samples (i.e. liquid containing eggs and debris) were diluted to
500 mL and mixed thoroughly before obtaining the manual egg counts for this bulk sample
using a nematode counting slide and dissecting microscope with a magnification of 100×.

The bulk egg sample was stained with acid fuchsin and split into ten different 50 mL test

tubes. The contents in five of these test tubes were cleaned using the OptiPrep™ cleaning
method (using a 50% by volume OptiPrep™ solution). The egg counts for these five samples
were obtained using the lensless method and the scanner-based egg counting method. The egg
counts were reported as the number of eggs per milliliter.

The remaining five test tubes of samples were cleaned by the sucrose centrifugation tech-
nique. Each tube was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 420 G and the excess water was decanted off.
The pellet was thoroughly mixed in 50 mL of the stock sucrose solution and centrifuged for
one additional minute to separate the eggs from the soil pellet. The sucrose solution superna-
tant, containing the eggs, was poured over a 37-μm-pore sieve and rinsed in water to remove
the excess sucrose. Three 1 mL sub-samples of the processed egg samples were placed on a
nematode counting slide, and the SCN eggs were manually counted under a microscope and
averaged to estimate the egg count per milliliter.

Soil samples were collected from two fields in Iowa–one each in Muscatine and Story
Counties. Soil was collected from two different places in Iowa to get a range of soil textures
with which to test the egg cleaning methods. Both methods of sample cleaning (i.e. OptiPrep™
and sucrose based) were conducted on ten different samples (five from Muscatine and five
from Story). The egg counting was done by three methods–nematode counting slide, scanner-

based, and lensless based. The mean and standard deviation of the egg count obtained from
the different sample cleaning methods (i.e. bulk, sucrose, OptiPrep™) and counting methods
(i.e. nematode counting slide (Chalex, LLC, Park City, UT), scanner, lensless setups) are tabu-
lated in Fig 8(B).

Lensless imaging method: Reconstruction of holographic videos

After sample cleaning using 50% OptiPrep™ by volume, a 1 mL solution of the interface layer
was loaded into a syringe. The dispensing needle of the syringe was connected to the input
port of the microfluidic flow chip. The syringe pump was turned on at a flow rate of 1 mL per
hour. As the liquid and particles began to pass through the flow channel, the RPi was turned
on and the holographic video was recorded (S1 Video). At the end of the video recording, the
video was transferred to a remote workstation and processed by a MATLAB script to generate
the reconstructed video. Reconstruction of a single frame of the video took approximately 4
seconds on the CPU (Intel Xeon E5, 32GB RAM).

Fig 9A illustrates the enhancement in object clarity after image reconstruction. Fig 9A(i.)
shows a section of the image captured from the lensless imaging setup (i.e. raw image). After
reconstruction, the clarity and focus of the raw image was considerably enhanced, and the
reconstructed image is shown in Fig 9A(ii.). For comparison, the bright-field image of the same
area was captured by a stereo microscope at 50× magnification and is shown in Fig 9A(iii.).

The reconstructed video had sufficient resolution and clarity to identify the nematode eggs

in every frame. Fig 9B shows time-lapsed image frames of a representative video that was
recorded from the lensless imaging setup and reconstructed thereafter. The image frames refer
to a small area of the flow channel. The eggs detected in each frame are marked in cyan color
with their distinct egg number. The video was recorded at 1 frame per second and the flow
rate was set to 1 mL/hour (S2 Video).

Performance of automated egg counting methods

We compared the accuracy of the egg counts obtained from the software program with manual
egg counts as shown in Fig 10. In total, there were fifteen images of filter papers corresponding
to the five different OptiPrep™ concentrations and their three individual layers (i.e. top, inter-
face, and bottom). Initially, the images of filter papers were divided into 324 patch images
(1024 × 1024 pixels) and saved in separate folders on the computer. To obtain the manual egg
counts, a user viewed each patch image and counted the number of eggs (Fig 8). This process
was repeated for all fifteen of the filter paper images. Next, to obtain egg counts from the soft-
ware program, each patch image was further split into 256 × 256 pixel sub-patches and ana-
lyzed using the trained deep learning model. Since the deep learning model was trained for
128 × 128 pixel images, the sub-patches were resized before being passed to the learning
model. Fig 10A shows the total egg counts calculated by the software program and by the man-
ual method for all the filter paper images. The R2 value between these two sets of data was high
indicating that there was good agreement between the two sets of counts. We also investigated
the correlation between the software and manual egg counts at a specific OptiPrep™ concentra-
tion (50%). There were a total of 972 patch images across the three layers, and the correlation
between them was high as well, as shown in Fig 10B. This high correlation demonstrates that
our software program can provide the egg count in processed samples with accuracy that is
comparable to visual detection.

To test the correlation of the software for egg counting used with the lensless imaging
setup, multiple samples (n = 12) were used. The processed samples, after cleaning with 50%
OptiPrep™, were passed through the lensless imaging setup. The raw holographic videos were

program to identify the eggs in every frame and provide the total egg count for the entire

the scanner-based egg counting method. The egg counts from the lensless method and the
scanner-based method were plotted for all the samples as shown in Fig 10c. There was high
correlation between the egg counts from both the methods with egg counts determined by
direct microscopic observation.

Discussion
OptiPrepTM-based sample cleaning method
The current state-of-the-art sample cleaning method involves the use of sucrose centrifugation
to separate plant-parasitic nematode juveniles and eggs from debris. While sucrose is inexpen-
sive and readily available, its high osmotic potential may have adverse effects on nematode
juveniles and eggs upon prolonged exposure. Also, if the sucrose solution is not adequately
washed away from the nematodes and eggs, there is the risk of bacterial and fungal growth in
the samples. To address these challenges of sucrose centrifugation, we developed an alternative
density gradient method using OptiPrepTM solution to separate plant-parasitic nematode eggs
from debris. OptiPrepTM has certain advantages over sucrose. OptiPrepTM is iso-osmotic and
nontoxic to biological materials such as cells and tissues. OptiPrepTM has a lower viscosity
compared to sucrose, which eases the mixing and washing steps with water. The lower viscos-
ity and osmolality of OptiPrepTM is advantageous to clean small volumes of sample homoge-
nates (5–10 mL in a 15 mL test tube) and to condense the eggs into the interface layer (2 mL)
within the centrifuge tube. Greater nematode egg recovery is achieved from 40% to 80% Opti-
PrepTM solutions (i.e. > 80% recovery) compared to those from the sucrose centrifugation (i.e.
less than 40% recovery) (Fig 7). As a disadvantage, the price of the OptiPrepTM density gradi-
ent medium is higher (approximately $250 USD for 250 mL) than sucrose. The high price of
OptiPrepTM may be a challenge for soil processing facilities which perform large-scale or rou-
tine separation of nematode eggs from debris.

Automated nematode egg counting methods

The traditional method of nematode egg counting is based on microscopic observation of sam-
ples. The chamber of nematode counting slides is loaded with 1 mL of the sample, and the
number of eggs on the grid is counted manually. Counting nematode eggs in this manner is a
cheap and relatively simple procedure but requires considerable time, expertise, and patience
of a trained expert [26]. Also, cross contamination can occur because of insufficient or
improper cleaning of the chamber in the nematode counting slide between samples. A deep
learning architecture was recently developed to identify SCN eggs from microscopic images of
nematode-counting slides [27]. Their input images (480 × 640 pixels) were subdivided into
16 × 16 image patches and passed through a selectivity function to identify patches with an
SCN egg. However, with this deep learning architecture, it is challenging to handle situations
with larger image sizes or multiple eggs (i.e. greater than two eggs) within an image patch such
as those obtained from bulk samples on our high-resolution scanner.

The new, scanner-based egg counting method we developed has advantages over previous
counting methods. Here the filter papers are automatically scanned to obtain the egg counts
using a trained deep learning model. Our deep learning model handles large input images
(17759 × 17759 pixels) which are subdivided into 4900 patches (256 × 256 pixels). The U-Net
convolutional autoencoder model can recognize multiple eggs within a patch using object
localization. The time to obtain the computerized egg counts from a single filter paper image is
around 5 minutes, whereas this time is much longer for manual counting and varies across dif-
ferent samples and persons. While the size of the sample assessed using a nematode counting
slide is limited by the volume of the observation chamber (1 mL) of the slide, each filter paper
can process around 12 mL of the sample suspension. Also, cross contamination between sam-
ples is eliminated in the scanner-based method as the substrate is a disposable filter paper. The
filter paper substrate is relatively inexpensive (approximately $0.48 USD) compared to the
nematode counting slide (approximately $50 USD). As a disadvantage, the scanner-based

Removing soil debris and high-throughput nematode egg counting

method requires a pre-processing step where the sample needs to be stained for proper identi-
fication. The staining process is performed at high temperature which eventually kill the eggs.
Also, it is difficult to recover the eggs after imaging as the processed sample is distributed on a
filter paper. Hence the scanner-based method is not suited for experiments where samples
containing live eggs or nematodes are to be counted for further use, such as to infest soil for
greenhouse experiments.

The new, lensless egg counting method has advantages over the manual slide counting and

scanner-based methods. Here egg staining is not required as the lensless imaging setup can
enumerate both stained and unstained samples. Because of continuous fluid flow through the
ports, the counted eggs are easily recovered for later use from the microfluidic flow chip. The
material cost is relatively low (less than $100 USD) for the lensless imaging setup and adhesive
tape microfluidics compared to the costs of standard microscopes, scanners, and nematode
counting slides used in previous methods. The lensless imaging method is functionally more
automated than the scanner-based method as a user only needs to load a syringe containing
the egg sample into a syringe pump, set the right volume and speed parameters, and start the
video recording process. As a disadvantage, the lensless egg counting method has a relatively
long processing time. The flow rate of the sample is 1 mL per hour; higher flow rates produce
noise in the recorded images. The reconstruction of the holographic video takes a few hours
and the egg counting software needs another 10 minutes to obtain the egg count.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we developed methods to improve the efficiency of SCN egg counting by sam-
ple cleaning and imaging on scanner and lensless setups. We also created software programs
to count the eggs. The use of OptiPrep™ during density gradient centrifugation helped capture
most of the nematode eggs in the interface layer. Egg recovery was greater than 80% in the
interface layer for the case of 50% OptiPrep™ by volume. Then the processed samples (i.e. eggs
with debris) were either placed on filter papers to record static images with a flatbed scanner
or passed through a microfluidic flow chip to record real-time, holographic videos by a lensless
imaging setup. In the scanner-based method, a convolutional autoencoder network recognized
the nematode eggs from static scanner images with reasonable accuracy as confirmed by visual
observations. For the lensless method, the software program successfully reconstructed the
holographic videos and identified the nematode eggs in the processed sample, which was sub-
sequently confirmed by the scanner-based method. The cost of the materials was low by using
off-the-shelf components (such as CMOS sensor, Raspberry Pi, LED), microfluidic flow chips
made from inexpensive double-sided adhesive tapes, and standard filter papers. Furthermore,
the use of image processing and deep learning tools circumvents the need for hiring and train-
ing personnel to count nematode eggs using nematode counting slides. With our new meth-
ods, manual intervention is only needed during sample preparation and loading; the software
programs handle the remaining operations automatically (i.e. image or video capture, detec-
tion and counting, data storage) over a broad range of nematode egg numbers (10–300 eggs/
mL).
