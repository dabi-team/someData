Abstract

Suppressing the inadvertent or deliberate interference for wireless networks is critical to guarantee

a reliable communication link. However, nullifying the jamming signals can be problematic when

the correlations between transmitted jamming signals are deliberately varied over time. Speciﬁcally,

recent studies reveal that by deliberately varying the correlations among jamming signals, attackers can

effectively vary the jamming channels and thus their nullspace, even when the physical channels remain

unchanged. That makes the estimated beam-forming matrix derived from the nullspace of the jamming

channels unable to suppress the jamming signals. Most existing interference nulliﬁcation solutions

only consider unchanged correlations or heuristically adapt to the time-varying correlation problem

by continuously monitoring the residual jamming signals before updating the estimated beam-forming

matrix. In this paper, we systematically formulate the optimization problem of the nullspace estimation

and data transmission phases. Even ignoring the unknown strategy of the jammers and the challenging

nullspace estimation process, the resulting problem is an integer programming problem, hence intractable

to obtain its optimal solution. To tackle it and address the unknown strategy of the jammer, we

reformulate the problem using a partially observable semi-Markov decision process (POSMDP) and then

design a deep dueling Q-learning based framework to tune the duration of the nullspace estimation and

data transmission phases. As such, the estimated beam-forming matrix remains effective even when the

correlations are time-varying. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed techniques effectively

deal with jamming signals whose correlations vary over time, and the range of correlations is unknown.

Especially, our techniques do not require continuous monitoring of the residual jamming signals (after

the nulliﬁcation process) before updating the estimated beam-forming matrix. As such, the system is

more spectral-efﬁcient and has a lower outage probability.

I. INTRODUCTION

The angle of arrival (AoA)-based beam-forming is among the most popular techniques to

suppress jamming signals. It is accomplished by estimating the AoAs of the incoming spatial

streams of the jamming signals using AoA estimation techniques, such as the multiple signal

classiﬁcation (MUSIC) [2], matrix pencil [3], and estimation of signal parameters via rotational

invariance techniques (ESPRIT) [4]. These AoA estimation techniques can be combined with

the spatial smoothing technique [5] to deal with the correlated jamming signals. However, for

this technique, at least one degree-of-freedom is needed to nullify each propagation path of the

jamming signals [6]. Hence, this approach is only applicable when the number of jammers is

small, and the environment is sparse multipath. In the rich scattering environment where the

number of propagation paths is large, the receiver has to “sacriﬁce” many degree-of-freedoms

for jamming suppression, resulting in a signiﬁcantly lower throughput [7].

Spread spectrum communication is another approach to deal with jamming signals. Specif-

ically, in the frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technique [8]–[11], the legitimate

devices try to avoid the jamming signals by ﬁrst detecting the jamming frequency range and then

switching their operating frequency to another channel (within their operating frequency band).

The direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique [8], [12], [13], on the other hand, uses

pseudo-random noise (PRN) codes to encode and spread the legitimate data signal to a much

larger bandwidth, hence avoiding narrow-band jamming. Moreover, using the DSSS technique,

the encoded data signals become noise-like and have low average power, making it challenging

for the jammer to detect and interfere. However, when the operating frequency band of the

legitimate devices is known to the jammers, they can perform wide-band jamming (i.e., given a

sufﬁcient jamming power) to void the functionality of the spread spectrum techniques.

Instead of “dodging” (i.e., by DSSS) or “escaping” (i.e., by FHSS), it has been shown that

legitimate devices can also leverage jamming signals for data transmission. In [14], using the

3

backscattering and energy harvesting, the legitimate transmitter can choose to either adapt its

transmission rate, backscatter the jamming signals, harvest energy (from the jamming signals),

or stay idle. In this way, the legitimate transmitter can mitigate the impact of the jamming

signals and even utilize jamming energy for its communication. However, this approach requires

additional hardware component, which is not always available, especially in mobile equipment.

Moreover, backscattering communication is limited in its transmission range and throughput.

Another popular anti-jamming solution is to estimate the jamming channels characteristics,

such as their nullspace [15], their projection [16], their ratios [17], and then derive corresponding

ﬁlters to suppress the jamming signals. These techniques merely require one degree-of-freedom

to deal with each jammer, thus are more efﬁcient than the aforementioned AoA-based approach.

However, most of the existing works, e.g., [15]–[17], overlook the impact of the time-varying

correlations between jamming signals on the nulliﬁcation process. The authors of [18] have

recently proved that by deliberately varying the correlations among jamming signals, attackers

can effectively vary the jamming channels (referred to as the “virtual change”) and thus their

nullspace, even when the physical channels remain unchanged. This makes the estimated beam-

forming matrix acquired from the estimated nullspace of the jamming channel outdated/incapable

of nullifying the jamming signals.

To deal with this “virtual change” in the jamming channels, one can continuously monitor the

residual jamming signals (after applying the nulliﬁcation technique) and then heuristically adjust

the estimated beam-forming matrix when the residual surpasses a given threshold. However,

such a jamming residual monitoring process incurs additional system overhead, thus signiﬁcantly

reducing the spectral efﬁciency. This gives rise to a more challenging problem on optimizing

the duration of the nullspace estimation and the data transmission phases. A longer nullspace

estimation phase may result in a lower jamming residual but then a shorter data transmission

phase. This optimization problem is similar to the training phase duration optimization in

MIMO communications (e.g., [19], [20]) as both errors (in channel estimation) lead to unwanted

interference to the legitimate signals, thus reducing the post-equalization SINR and consequently

the spectral efﬁciency. However, unlike [19], [20] in which the training signals and the channel

estimator can be designed to quantify the mean and variance of the channel estimation error,

the jamming signals in our scenario are totally controlled by the jammers. This makes most

training-window optimization approaches, e.g., [19], [20] inapplicable. Note that suppressing

jamming signals with an outdated estimated beam-forming matrix can result in even lower

4

spectral efﬁciency than not using the method. This is because the jamming nulliﬁcation requires

legitimate users to sacriﬁce antennas/degree-of-freedoms that would be otherwise used for data

transmission.

Given the above, this article proposes a solution to nullify multiple correlated jammers whose

correlation is unknown and time-varying. To this end, we ﬁrst systematically formulate the

optimization problem of the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases. Even ignoring the

unknown strategy of the jammers and the challenging nullspace estimation process, the resulting

problem is an integer programming problem, hence intractable to obtain its optimal solution.

In practice, as aforementioned, the jammers can deliberately vary the correlation range, making

jamming nulliﬁcation even more challenging. To deal with such uncertainty and incomplete

information as well as to circumvent the intractability of the above conventional optimization

problem, we reformulate the problem using a partially observable semi-Markov decision process

(POSMDP). Then, we design a deep dueling Q-learning based technique to quickly obtain the

optimal policy for the legitimate devices. The proposed technique does not require the legitimate

devices to constantly monitor the residual jamming signals (and then update the estimated beam-

forming matrix), and only costs a single degree-of-freedom to nullify each jammer, even with an

unknown and time-varying correlated jamming strategy. At the beginning of the neural network

in the proposed technique, we use the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer to capture the

time-varying characteristic of the correlations and represent them by the output of the LSTM

layer. The output of the LSTM layer is then used by a deep dueling neural network structure

[21], which allows the proposed technique to obtain the optimal solution much faster than the

conventional Q-learning, hence very effective in dealing with the time-varying jamming strategy

of jammers. Simulation results show that the resulting spectral efﬁciency is much higher than

that of other methods and close to that of the perfect jamming nulliﬁcation case (for moderate

jamming power). The proposed approach also yields a lower outage probability than the existing

ones. The major contributions of the paper are as follows.

• Derive the spectral efﬁciency bounds of each communication link using the estimated beam-

forming matrix in the presence of jamming signals.

• Demonstrate that using an incorrectly estimated beam-forming matrix (i.e., resulting from

the “virtual change” in the jamming channel caused by the time-varying correlations) can

waste the receiver’s degree-of-freedoms without achieving effective jamming suppression,

corresponding to the lower bound spectral efﬁciency. Note that this lower-bound spectral

efﬁciency is even lower than that of the case without using the estimated beam-forming

matrix.

• Formulate an optimization problem for the duration of the nullspace estimation and data

transmission phases. The objective is to maximize the spectral efﬁciency and minimize the

outage probability.

• Develop a partially observable semi-Markov decision process (POSMDP) framework to

capture the dynamic and uncertainty of the jamming strategy and jamming channels. We then

design a deep dueling Q-learning technique to obtain the optimal durations for the nullspace

estimation and data transmission phases to maximize the system’s spectral efﬁciency.

• Carry out intensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and

compare it with start-of-the-art jamming suppression methods and the upper bound where

the jamming is perfectly nulliﬁed.

The organization of the paper is as follows. Section II describes the system model. Section

III formulates the problem being investigated. The deep dueling Q-learning technique to solve

the stated problem is presented in Section IV. The simulation results are given in Section V.

Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section VI.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

We consider a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) downlink system with

one base station (BS) and K user equipment (UEs) as demonstrated in Fig. 1. The BS and each

kth UE have ULA structures with NT and Nk antennas, respectively. The BS-UEs communication

and results obtained in this paper also capture the case with multi-antenna jammers that can be

considered as multiple single-antenna jammers. For either case, we assume the total number of

jamming antennas is NJ.

xJ = [xJ1; xJ2; ...xJNJ] ∈ CNJ×1 is the transmitted jamming signal, Zk ∈ CNk×NJ is the jammers-
kth UE channel, and w ∈ CNk×1 is complex noise. The elements of w are assumed to be zero-

mean circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian random variables (i.e., w ∼ CN (0, σ2

INk denotes the identity matrix of size Nk, and σ2
w is the noise variance). Likewise, we assume
xk ∼ CN (0, IMk). The precoding matrix Pk is normalized to meet the power constraint, such
that ||Pk||F = 1, where ||.||F denotes the Frobenius norm of a matrix.

C. Jamming Signal Model

Similar to [18], we assume xJ ∼ CP(µJ, ΣJ), where P denotes a distribution function, µJ
and ΣJ are the mean and covariance matrix of xJ. Note that the jamming strategy, P, µJ and
ΣJ are unknown to the BS and the UEs.

Let ρij be the complex Pearson correlation between the transmitted jamming signals from the

ith and the jth jammer. The value of ρij can be expressed by [22, Ch. 4]

As mentioned in the introduction and will be described in more detail in Subsection III-B,

the time-varying correlations between transmitted jamming signals create a “virtual change” in

the jamming channel, even when the physical channels stay unchanged. Based on the behav-

ior of the “virtual change”in the jamming channel, the jammers can disable the functionality

of the conventional jamming suppression techniques by deliberately varying the correlations

amongst jamming signals. Formally, the correlations between the transmitted jamming signals

are controlled by the jammers using the formula

where J is a function unknown to the UEs and the BS.

III. PROBLEM FORMULATION

We ﬁrst describe the communication protocol and the estimated beam-forming matrix em-

ployed to suppress the jamming signals. We then brieﬂy analyze the impacts of the time-varying

correlations among jamming signals on the jamming suppression process (using the estimated

beam-forming matrix). Next, we derive the upper and lower bounds for the spectral efﬁciency of

9

each BS-UE communication link that employs the estimated beam-forming matrix to suppress

the jamming signals. Finally, we mathematically state the problem. To highlight the impact of

the time-varying correlations on designing the estimated beam-forming matrix, we assume that

the BS-UEs and the jamming channels follow a block-fading model with coherence time T c,

corresponding to N c samples. We further assume that the nullspace estimation, preamble, and

data transmission phases of the communication protocol (described below) are performed within

the interval T c, such that N e + N p + N d < N c, where N e, N p, N d are the number of samples

of the nullspace estimation, preamble, and data transmission phase, respectively.

A. Communication Protocol

Fig. 2 illustrates the communication protocol for the jamming/interference nulliﬁcation purpose

[26]. As shown, each frame is comprised of three phases: nullspace estimation, preamble, and

data transmission.

• During the nullspace estimation phase, which lasts for N e samples, the beam-forming matrix
ˆFk that is used to suppress the jamming signals, is estimated. Let Fk denote the actual value
of ˆFk. Gk ∈ C(Nk−NJ)×Nk is a matrix whose rows form an orthonormal basis for the left
nullspace [27, Ch. 2] of the received jamming signals, and let ˆGk denotes the estimated
value of Gk. The estimated beam-forming matrix ˆFk is designed by choosing its rows from
the rows of ˆGk. Therefore, let Bk be the row number of ˆFk, one has Bk ≤ (Nk − NJ).
To leverage all (Nk − NJ) remaining degree-of-freedoms (after jamming suppression) for
BS-UE signal multiplexing, we set ˆFk = ˆGk by letting Bk = (Nk − NJ). Similar to [15],
ˆGk can be estimated using the singular value decomposition (SVD) as follows.

• During the preamble phase, which lasts for N p samples, the jamming signals are nulliﬁed by
multiplying Eq. (1) with ˆFk, and the BS-UE equivalent channel ˜Hk (i.e., ˜Hk = ˆFkHkPk)
is estimated. The estimation of ˜Hk can be performed using pilot signals and a channel

estimator, such as the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) or least-square (LS) technique.

• During the data transmission phase, which lasts for N d samples, the BS send data to UEs.

Let δk,m[n] denote the post-equalization signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of

the mth stream for the kth UE during the data transmission phase of the nth frame. As will

be demonstrated in Appendix A, δk,m[n] can be given by

B. Impact of the Time-varying Correlations on Jamming Suppression

The estimated beam-forming matrix ˆFk described in the previous subsection is derived from
ˆGk, whose rows form an orthonormal basis for the left nullspace of the jamming signal. Within
the jamming channel’s coherence time [28], ˆFk is capable of nullifying the jamming signals.

Nevertheless, as shown in [18], when the correlations between transmitted jamming signals

are time-varying, they create a “virtual change” in the jamming channel, hence degrading the
estimation accuracy of ˆGk and making ˆFk unable to suppress the jamming signals. Speciﬁcally,
let ρe
ij be ρij values in the nullspace estimation phase and data transmission phase,
J denote ΣJ values in these two phases. The time-varying

(13)

Interesting intuitions about the impact of time-varying correlations on the jamming suppression
capability of ˆFk can be obtained by examining the behavior of the “virtual change” factor D in

J = Σe

Eq. (13), Σd

the jamming channel. First, when the correlations are unchanged over time, from Eq. (3) and
J, Sd = Se, Vd = Ve, and hence, from Eq. (12), D = I. Therefore, when
the correlations are unchanged over time, there is no “virtual change” in the jamming channel.
Therefore, in this case, within the jamming channel’s coherence time, ˆFk derived from ˆGk can

be utilized to suppress the jamming signals regardless of the (ﬁxed) correlation values. Second,

when the correlations are time-varying, the behavior of elements of the non-identity “virtual

change” matrix D is described by Corollary 1.1 [18] below.

Corollary 1.1: When |ρe

ij| → 1 and ρd

ij (cid:54)= ρe

ij, the elements of the “virtual change” factor D

approach inﬁnity.

The elements of D approach inﬁnity when |ρe

ij| → 1. As a result, the estimation ˆGk is not
accurate, and thus ˆFk is not close to Fk. In this case, using ˆFk leads to signiﬁcant jamming

residual and hence a low post-equalization SINR at the receiver in the data transmission phase.

The jammers then can use the jamming signals model in Eq. (4) to maximize the jamming impact
by degrading the estimation accuracy of ˆFk. Theorem 2 below analyzes the effectiveness of ˆFk

in nullifying the jamming signals by examining the lower and upper spectral efﬁciency bounds

of each BS-UE communication link. For illustration purposes, we assume that the zero-forcing

equalization is used at the UE receiver.

of Eq. (15) and Eq. (16) to that of Eq. (17). Especially, when the estimated beam-forming matrix
ˆFk is not accurate (e.g., because of the impact of the time-varying correlations as illustrated in
Corollary 1.1), its use can lead to the worst case with the lower-bound spectral efﬁciency. In this

case, the UE receiver lost NJ degree-of-freedoms without achieving any jamming nulliﬁcation

effect, leaving the denominator of Eq. (15) unchanged compared to that of Eq. (17). On the other
hand, when ˆFk is estimated perfectly (i.e., ˆFk = Fk), the UE receiver can completely nullify the

jamming signals, leaving only the noise in the denominator of Eq. (16), thereby achieving the

upper-bound spectral efﬁciency. In the sequel, we aim to accurately estimate the beam-forming
matrix ˆFk, even when the correlations are time-varying; thereby targeting the perfect beam-

forming, with the spectral efﬁciency of each stream close to the upper bound given in Eq. (16).

C. Problem Formulation

Given the above, one can maximize the spectral efﬁciency by continuously adapting the

length of the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases (i.e., N e and N d, respectively).

Speciﬁcally, N e and N d can be tuned based on the following principles.

• First, N e and N d are jointly optimized to guarantee that the estimation ˆFk can be obtained
when none of |ρe
ij| is close to 1. As presented in Corollary 1.1, when |ρe
ij| → 1, the elements
of D approach inﬁnity, making the estimated beam-forming matrix ˆFk unable to suppress

the jamming signals, and hence resulting in a lower spectral efﬁciency.

• Second, by saving the time spent on monitoring the residual jamming signals as in [18] to

update the estimated beam-forming matrix, the effective spectral efﬁciency of the system

can be signiﬁcantly improved, as demonstrated in Eq. (10). In fact, only when necessary,

the system may increase the nullspace estimation time (by increasing N e) to average the

correlations between transmitted jamming signals and avoid |ρe

ij| being close to 1.

13

• Third, by adjusting N d, the communication system can adapt to the change in the BS-UE

channel condition. For example, when the channel coherence time decreases, the value of

N d should be decreased to maintain an acceptable post-equalization SINR level (e.g., above

the required minimum post-equalization SINR, below which the UE is considered to be an

outage). On the other hand, when the coherence time increases, the system can increase

N d to improve the communication phase fraction over the whole frame, hence increasing

the effective spectral efﬁciency.

The optimization of the durations of the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases can

be formally stated as follows:

where N is the number of frames and δmin is the required minimum post-equalization SINR,

below which the UE is considered to be an outage.

There are analogies between the estimation error of Fk and that of the BS-UE channel in

MIMO communications (e.g., [19], [20]), because both errors lead to unwanted interference to

the legitimate signals, thus reducing the post-equalization SINR and consequently the spectral

efﬁciency. However, unlike [19], [20] in which the training signals and the channel estimator

can be designed to quantify the mean and variance of the channel estimation error, the jamming

signals in our scenario are controlled by the jammers (i.e., described by Eq. (4)). Therefore,

the BS and UE do not have knowledge of the mean and variance of δFk. More importantly,

to make jamming suppression even more challenging, the jammers can deliberately adjust the

correlations controlling function J , making the previous measurements no longer representative

of the current jamming strategy. To deal with such incomplete information and uncertainty, in

the next section, we reformulate the deep dueling Q-learning technique to solve the problem

stated in Eq. (18).

14

IV. DEEP DUELING Q-LEARNING TECHNIQUE FOR JAMMING SUPPRESSION

This section reformulate the problem (18) using a partially observable semi-Markov decision

process (POSMDP). We then design a deep dueling Q-learning based framework to tune the

durations of the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases by obtaining the optimal

policy for the underlying POSMDP process.

A. Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process (POSMDP)

A conventional MDP is deﬁned by a tuple (S, A, r), where S, A, and r denote the state space,

action space, and the reward function, respectively. An SMDP, on the other hand, retains the

three components mentioned above and adds an additional component that is the nth decision

epoch length, denoted by t[n]. In an MDP, the state transition occurs at regular time steps (and

hence the decision epoch length t[n] is excluded). On the other hand, the SMDP allows the state

transition to occur at irregular time steps (i.e., different t[n] for different epochs), facilitating the

selections of N e and N d at irregular state transition times.

1) State Space: There are several essential factors to consider for maximizing the effective

spectral efﬁciency of the system while avoiding outage. The ﬁrst factor is the post-equalization

SINR at the UEs during the previous data transmission phase. This is because the post-equalization

SINR implicitly captures the BS-UE channel condition that affects the selection of N d. Specif-

ically, when the post-equalization SINR in the previous data transmission phase is poor (e.g.,

below or close to δmin), N d value can be decreased to improve the post-equalization SINR.

Hence, the system can avoid outages and increase spectral efﬁciency during the data transmission

phase. However, N d should not be incautiously decreased, as that reduces the fraction of the

data transmission phase over the whole frame and thus reduces the effective spectral efﬁciency

of the system. The second factor, as demonstrated in the previous section by Corollary 1.1,

is the correlation between transmitted jamming signals in the nullspace estimation phase. This

is because the correlations ρe
ij affect the magnitude of the “virtual change” factor D in the
jamming channel, which directly affects the jamming nulliﬁcation capability of ˆFk. Therefore,

the system’s state space can be deﬁned as
S =∆ (cid:8)(δk,m, ρe

ij) :∀k ∈ (1, 2, ..., K),

∀m ∈ (1, 2, ..., Mk),∀i (cid:54)= j; i, j ∈ (1, 2, ..., NJ)(cid:9).

(19)

2) Observation: The ﬁrst component of the state space (i.e., the post-equalization SINR δk,m)
can be estimated from the constellation points in the data transmission phase. Let ˆδk,m be the
estimated value of δk,m. According to [29], ˆδk,m can be calculated by

ˆδk,m[n] = 10 log10

(20)

where Ik,m,i and Qk,m,i are the ideal in-phase and quadrature components of the ith actual

constellation point, respectively. On the other hand, δIk,m,i and δQk,m,i are the in-phase and

quadrature absolute differences between the ith actual and ideal constellation points, respectively.

These terms are demonstrated in more detail in Fig. 3. For each ith actual constellation point,

the δIk,m,i and δQk,m,i values are calculated by subtracting Ik,m,i and Qk,m,i from the in-phase
and quadrature components of the actual constellation point, respectively. Then, ˆδk,m can be

calculated using Eq. (20). In fact, out of the two components of the state space, only the post-

equalization SINR is observable at the UE as described above. The correlation coefﬁcients, on

the other hand, are controlled by the jammers (i.e., by Eq. (4)), and are neither known nor

directly observable by the UEs or the BS. The ρe

, while large correlations result in massive differences between the

Therefore, we formulate the problem as a partially observable SMDP (POSMDP) [30], where
the state in Eq. (19) is replaced by the approximate state ˆS derived from the observations.

Accordingly, we replace s with ˆs without further notice in all notations while keeping their

meaning. For example, the optimal (approximate) state-action value function (introduced later)

is denoted by Q∗(ˆs, a) instead of Q∗(s, a).

where ¯δk = (1/Mk) (cid:80)Mk
ˆδk,m is the average post-equalization SINR, Λk,l is the lth largest
singular value of Re
k=1 Λk,l. To generate the observation at each epoch,
Jk
K average post-equalization SINR values ¯δk and (K ∗ NJ) singular values Λk,l are calculated
at the K UEs. The observation is then obtained by concatenating K average post-equalization
SINR values ¯δk and NJ average singular value ˆΛl. Note that, similar to the state S mentioned
above, the observation O is composed of ¯δk and ¯Λl values in the most recent frame, such that
o[n] =∆ (cid:2)¯δk[n − 1], ¯Λl[n − 1](cid:3).
Similar to [30], [31], we use the last H observations and actions as the approximate state,
i.e., ˆs[n] =∆ (cid:2)o[n], a[n − 1], o[n − 1], ..., a[n − H](cid:3), where H denotes the history length. This

(22)

formalism, referred to as the Hth-order history approach, generates a large but ﬁnite POSMDP,

in which each sequence is a distinct approximate state. As a result, we can apply standard

reinforcement learning techniques used in MDPs or SMDPs to ﬁnd the optimal action given the

B. Q-learning Technique

This subsection introduces Q-learning [33], a model-free reinforcement learning technique

used to acquire the optimal policy π∗ without requiring prior information about jamming strategy

as well as the channels condition. Let V(s), Q(s, a) and G(s, a) denote the state value function,

the state-action value function, and the (state-dependent) action advantages function, respectively.

The state value function V(s) is the expected cumulative reward of the system starting from the

state s, illustrating “how good” it is for the system to be in the state s. The state-action value

function Q(s, a) demonstrates the expected discounted reward of the system in state s selecting

an action a. Finally, the action advantages function G(s, a) subtracts the state value function

V(s) from the state-action value function Q(s, a) to acquire the importance of each action.

The objective of the Q-learning is to ﬁnd the optimal value of the state-action value function

Q(s, a), denoted by Q∗(s, a), for all state-action pairs. Then, the optimal policy π∗ is obtained by
π∗ = arg maxa Q∗(s, a), meaning at each state, the system selects the action that maximizes the
expected discounted reward. The optimal state-action value function Q∗(s, a) can be achieved

by executing an action, observing the next state and the immediate reward, and updating Q(s, a)

at each iteration. A detailed description of the Q-learning can be found in [30], [33].

The Q-learning technique can be used to obtain the optimal policy π∗. However, this technique

suffers from the slow-convergence problem. As mentioned in the previous subsection, the state

s is not fully observable by the BS and all the UEs. Therefore, we use the approximate state ˆs

18

to derive the optimal policy π∗. Nevertheless, the approximate state components (i.e., ¯δk and ¯Λl)

are continuous values, resulting in an inﬁnite dimension of the approximate state. Quantization

of the approximate state components can reduce the dimension. However, a smaller quantization

step size (i.e., for better accuracy) results in a larger approximate state space, causing the

Q-learning technique to converge slowly. Moreover, the approximate state is composed of H

latest observations and actions, further increasing the dimension of the approximate state, and

aggravating the slow-convergence issue. Therefore, in the following subsection, we adopt the

deep dueling Q-learning technique [21], which uses a specialized neural network to efﬁciently

obtain the optimal policy π∗.

C. Deep Dueling Q-learning Technique

This subsection presents the deep dueling Q-learning technique [21] to deal with the partially

observable and the slow-convergence problems of the Q-learning technique. In the Q-learning

approach, Q∗(s, a) is iteratively obtained and stored in a Q-table. However, in the deep dueling

Q-learning technique, a neural network, referred to as the Q-network and denoted by Q, is used

as a nonlinear function approximator to estimate Q∗(ˆs, a). The input to the Q-network Q is the

approximate state ˆs, and the output from Q is the optimal state-action value function Q∗(ˆs, a).

Let θ denotes the parameters of the Q-network Q; the problem of ﬁnding Q∗(ˆs, a) becomes the

problem of ﬁnding θ∗, which are the optimal values of θ. Accordingly, we include θ in the state

value function, the state-action value function, and the action advantages function notations. For

example, the state-action value function is now denoted by Q(ˆs, a; θ), and its optimum is denoted

by Q∗(ˆs, a; θ∗). The deep dueling Q-learning technique to iteratively optimize θ is presented in

Algorithm 1. This algorithm is based on the one in [31], and formed by the following techniques.

• (cid:15)-greedy action selection policy: At each training iteration, the system implements explo-

ration (i.e., by selecting a random action) with a probability of (cid:15), or exploitation (i.e.,

by choosing the action that maximizes the current state-action value Q(ˆs, a; θ)) with a

probability of 1 − (cid:15). The value of (cid:15) is large (e.g., (cid:15) = 1) at the starting iteration, and decays

over the iterations as θ gets closer to the optimal value θ∗.

• Experience replay: Instead of using instant transition at each iteration, the system stores

the transitions in a memory pool M of size M using the ﬁrst-in-ﬁrst-out (FIFO) protocol.

At each training iteration, a random set is obtained from M to train the Q-network. This

technique allows the previous transitions to be used more than once, hence improving the

19

training data’s efﬁciency. More importantly, by randomly selecting the training data from

M, the algorithm can remove the correlation between the consecutive training data.

• Target Q-network: This technique is performed by using a separate network for generating

the target Q-values y[j], as demonstrated by step 9 in Algorithm 1. The separate network
with parameter ˆθ is named the target Q-network, and denoted by ˆQ. Instead of updating
at every iteration, the target Q-network ˆQ is only renewed every C steps. As such, the

primary Q-network is slowly updated, which helps to reduce the correlations between the

estimated and target Q-values, hence improving the stability of the deep dueling Q-learning

technique.

• Mini-batch gradient descent [34]: At each training iteration of the deep dueling Q-learning

technique, instead of performing gradient descent using the whole data memory M, the

system randomly samples a mini-batch with Nmb samples from M, and then performs

mini-batch gradient descent on the mini-batch. By setting Nmb (cid:28) D, the training time can

be reduced dramatically [34].

D. Network Structure and Complexity Analysis

In this subsection, we introduce the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [35]-based deep

dueling Q-network used in the deep dueling Q-learning technique. The network is illustrated

in Fig. 4. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNN) that have difﬁculty learning the

long-term dependencies of the inputs [36], the LSTM is capable of learning those dependencies,

even with inputs consisting of more than 1000 discrete-time steps. That is because the LSTM is

designed to avoid the “vanishing gradient” and exploding gradient”, which are the main problems

in the training process of the RNN. Therefore, the LSTM is capable of solving sequential

processing tasks not solvable by the RNN. On the other hand, the deep dueling network structure

[21] is developed to improve the convergence rate of the deep Q-learning technique, thanks to

its innovative network structure. Speciﬁcally, the dueling structure contains two streams that

separately estimate the state value and the advantages of actions. As such, the advantage streams

of the network can concentrate on learning from only the relevant input (i.e., approximate state),

hence improving the convergence rate. The input-output ﬂow of the LSTM-based deep dueling

Q-network in Fig. 4 is as follows.

First, the approximate state ˆs is fed into the LSTM layer as the input. The LSTM captures

the time-varying characteristic of the correlations between transmitted jamming signals (i.e.,
by observing the average singular values ¯Λl) and the change in channels condition (i.e., by
monitoring the average post-equalization SINR values ¯δk). The output from the LSTM is then

processed by two separated streams of fully-connected hidden layers to calculate the state

value function V(ˆs; θ) and the advantages of actions G(ˆs, a; θ). The state-action value function

that in Eq. (28), for simplicity, the bias parameters in the neurons are ignored. Note also that the

training process is performed by the BS, which has more computational power than the UEs.

Moreover, when necessary, the training process can be ofﬂoaded to a cloud server connected to

the BS through a backhaul link.

A. Parameter Setting

V. SIMULATION

We consider a 200 kHz bandwidth (i.e., corresponding to a symbol duration of 5 µs) MIMO

system containing a BS and K = 4 UEs, each receiving Mk = 3 signal streams from the BS.

The BS and all the UEs have ULA array structures with 12 and 8 antennas, respectively (i.e.,

NT = 12 and Nk = 8, ∀k ∈ (1, 2, 3, 4)). The carrier frequency is 447 MHz and the transmitted

power is PT = 44 dBm. The received signals at the receivers are sampled at a sampling rate of

22

400 kHz. The legitimate signals are modulated using the 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation

(QAM) technique. To evaluate the system’s performance more directly, we do not use any forward

error correction (FEC) coding. As presented in [38], the standard root mean square (RMS) delay

spread in the urban, suburban, combined, and rural areas are all equal or smaller than 0.73 µs.

Therefore, the ratio between the symbol duration and the RMS delay spread is 5/0.73 ≈ 7. As

a result, the intersymbol interference (ISI) impact on BS-UE signal decoding is negligible. For

small-scale fading, as presented in Section II, a ﬂat fast fading Rayleigh model in [25] is used

to simulate the jammers-UEs and BS-UEs channels. We assume the jammers-UE and BS-UE

relative velocities are around 20 km/h, corresponding to a Doppler frequency of Fd = 8.28 Hz.
The number of propagation paths for each BS-UE link is N p

k = 8, ∀k ∈ (1, 2, 3, 4). For the
large-scale path-losses ηk and ηk,j, we use the COST 231 Hata model [24, Ch. 4], and assume

hT = 50 m, hJ = hUE = 2 m, and dJ = dT = 100 m, where hT, hJ, hUE, dJ, and dT denote

BS’s height, jammers’ height, UEs’ height, the initial distance from each jammer to the UEs,

and initial BS-UE distance, respectively. Without loss of generality, we assume the BS and the

jammers are stationary, and the heights of all the UEs are unchanged while moving.

There are NJ = 2 jammers with intentionally time-varying correlations between their transmit-

ted signals. As presented, the time-varying correlations between the transmitted jamming signals

cause a “virtual change” in the jamming channel. For demonstration, the correlation ρ12 between

the two jammers is assumed to repeatedly and linearly decrease from 1 to 0.8 over 5000 samples.

Speciﬁcally, the correlation at pth sample is given by

ρ12(p) = J (p) = 1 − 0.2(p − 5000 × (cid:98)p/5000(cid:99)),

(29)

where (cid:98).(cid:99) denotes the ﬂoor function, determining the closest smaller integer.

The candidate sets for N e and N d are N e = (10, 20, 30, 40) and N d = (200, 250, 300, 350)

samples (i.e., corresponding to (100, 125, 150, 175) symbols per each data transmission phase),

respectively. The selections for N e and N d follow the ETSI standard for Terrestrial Trunked

Radio (TETRA) [39]. The parameters of the LSTM-based deep dueling Q-network and its

training parameters are given in Table. II, which are similar to those in [14], [31].

To illustrate the advantage of the proposed technique, we compare the following schemes:

• Upper bound: The system is assumed to perfectly nullify the jamming signals by using the

estimated beam-forming matrix. For illustration purposes, instead of being calculated using

the received jamming signal in the nullspace estimation phase, the beam-forming matrix

23

is directly estimated using the jamming signal in the data transmission phase (which is, in

reality, unknown to the system).

• Fixed action: The system uses a ﬁxed pair of values for N e and N d. The performance

metrics are calculated by averaging the performance of (Le × Ld) action choices;

• Heuristic approach [18]: The system uses the jamming nulliﬁcation technique in [18], in

which the residual jamming signals are measured, and the estimated beam-forming matrix

is updated whenever the residual exceeds a predeﬁned value;

• Proposed technique: The values of N e and N d are determined by the optimal policy obtained

using the proposed deep dueling Q-learning technique.

learning technique achieves the highest average effective spectral efﬁciency for all values of the

jamming power, thanks to its ability to efﬁciently adjust the N e and N d values according to the

change in the correlations and channel conditions. On the other hand, the other two techniques

have several limitations. The technique in [18] spends an excessive amount of time monitoring

the residual jamming signals and estimating the beam-forming matrix, thus reducing the data

transmission time. Meanwhile, the ﬁxed action technique cannot adapt to the change in the

channel conditions, and more importantly, that in the correlations between transmitted jamming
signals, resulting in an ineffective estimated beam-forming matrix ˆFk. These limitations of [18]
and ﬁxed action result in lower spectral efﬁciencies of the communication system. Note that

there is a gap between the spectral efﬁciency of the proposed technique and that of the upper

bound. This is because, in the upper bound case, the jamming signal is completely canceled out

without needing to adjust the values of N e and N d. Meanwhile, for the proposed technique, N e
may have to be increased to improve the estimation accuracy of ˆFk, hence reducing the effective

spectral efﬁciency.

2) Outage Probability Analysis: Fig. 6 illustrates the outage probability of the systems using

the three mentioned techniques and different values of the jamming power. As can be seen, the

proposed deep dueling Q-learning technique and the techniques in [18] have very similar outage

probabilities, and are much lower than that of the ﬁxed action technique. This is because the ﬁxed

action technique cannot adapt to the change of the correlations between transmitted jamming

signals and channels condition, resulting in many outage frames because of excessive jamming

residuals. On the other hand, both heuristic approach and the proposed technique effectively

nullify the jamming signals. However, as mentioned above, the heuristic approach in [18] spends

an excessive amount of time monitoring the residual jamming signals and estimating the beam-

forming matrix, resulting in a much lower spectral efﬁciency. Note that there is a difference

in the outage probability between the proposed technique and the upper bound, because the

jamming signal, in fact, cannot be entirely canceled out as in the upper bound case.

3) Impact of History Length H: Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 illustrate the impact of the historical length

H on the convergence of the proposed deep dueling Q-learning technique. The jamming power

used to generate these ﬁgures is 30 dBm. As can be seen, the deep dueling Q-learning technique

converges after around 2×104 iterations. Note that due to the randomness of the environment and

the initialization of the LSTM-based deep neural network, the number of iterations required for

convergence may vary. Note also that, at the converged status, a longer history length H results

in a higher effective spectral efﬁciency and a lower outage probability. However, increasing the

value of H also increases the computational complexity of the deep dueling Q-learning technique,

as demonstrated by Eq. (28). Another interesting point is that, the spectral efﬁciency and the

outage probability do not dramatically improve when H increases from 6 to 8. Therefore, using

H = 6 can balance the technique’s performance and computational complexity.

4) Adaptability to the Change in Jamming Strategy: Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 illustrate the capability

of the deep dueling Q-learning technique to adapt the optimal anti-jamming policy when the

jamming strategy is changed. Speciﬁcally, from the (8 × 105)th iterations, instead of linearly

decreasing as in Eq. (29), the correlation is linearly increase from 0.8 to 1 as

ρ12(p) = J (cid:48)(p) = 0.8 + 0.2[(p − 8 × 105) − 5000(cid:98)(p − 8 × 105)/5000(cid:99)].

As can be seen, the deep dueling Q-learning technique can adapt to the change in the jamming

strategy by quickly re-obtain the convergence for both effective spectral efﬁciency and outage

probability. In particular, the re-establishments of the convergence status (i.e., from the (8×105)th

iteration where the jamming strategy changes) are even slightly faster than the ﬁrst convergence

(i.e., from the ﬁrst iteration). This is because the Q-network at the (8 × 105)th iteration is

“initialized” by the network parameters obtained from the previous training process. Therefore,

this “initialization” performs better than the random initialization at the ﬁrst iteration when the

training process begins.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have examined the impact of time-varying correlations between transmitted jamming

signals on jamming nulliﬁcation. We have demonstrated that using an incorrectly estimated

beam-forming matrix can waste the receiver’s degree-of-freedoms without achieving effective

jamming suppression. We have proposed the deep dueling Q-learning technique to effectively

estimate the beam-forming matrix and nullify the jamming signals designed to aggravate the

jamming impact. The dueling network architecture allows our proposed technique to quickly

obtain the optimal solution against the jammers, therefore very effective in dealing with unknown

and time-varying jamming strategies. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed deep

dueling Q-learning technique achieves a higher effective spectral efﬁciency and a lower outage

probability than the existing techniques.

Assuming the BS-UE channel can be estimated correctly, the received signal at the kth UE

after zero-forcing equalization can be expressed by

values of ˜Hk, ˜Zk, and ˜w can be expressed by

First, considering the case without beam-forming, from Eq. (30), the post-equalization SINR

of the mth stream for the kth UE can be expressed by

Since AZF

When the estimated beam-forming matrix is applied, the post-equalization SINR of the mth

(37)

where δFk = ˆFk − Fk is the estimation error of Fk.

When the estimated beam-forming matrix is estimated perfectly (i.e., δFk = 0), the jamming

signals are cancelled totally, Eq. (37) becomes

δub
k,m =

(38)

Similar to the case without the estimated beam-forming matrix, we evaluate the covariance of

AZF

Cov(AZF

reduces the dimension the BS-UE equivalent channel from Nk × Mk into (Nk − NJ ) × Mk.

Therefore, the spectral efﬁciency for when the beam-forming is estimated perfectly is
