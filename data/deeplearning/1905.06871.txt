Abstract.  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  technology  is  based  on  theory  and  development  of  computer 
systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. In this context, deep learning is 
a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large 
set  of  examples  that  demonstrate  the  desired  behavior.  Application  of  these  methods  to  medical 
imaging can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype, gene mutations and/or metastases for 
applying appropriate therapies. The purpose of this study is to show the emerging application of AI in 
medical  imaging  to  detect  lung  and  breast  cancer.  Moreover,  this  study  shows  the  comparative 
evolutionary pathways of this emerging technology for three critical cancers: lung, breast and thyroid. 
A  main  finding  of  this  study  is  the  recognition  that,  since  the  late  1990,  the  sharp  increase  of 
technological trajectories of AI technology applied in cancer imaging seems to be driven by high rates 
of mortality of some types of cancer (e.g., lung and breast) in order to find new techniques for a more 
accurate detection, characterization and monitoring as well as to apply efficiently anticancer therapies 
that increase the progression-free survival of patients: the so-called mortality-driven AI technological 
trajectories. Results also suggest that this new technology can generate a technological paradigm shift 
for  diagnostic  assessment  of  any  cancer  type.  However,  application  of  these  methods  to  medical 
imaging requires further assessment and validation  to assist  pathologists to  increase the efficiency  of 
their workflow in both routine tasks and critical cases of diagnostics. 

Keywords: artificial intelligence, deep learning algorithms, machine learning, cancer imaging, clinical

Introduction 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the research field that studies and develops technological systems that can 

solve complex tasks in ways that would traditionally need human intelligence (Iafrate, 2018). This new 

technology,  originated  from  interaction  between  engineering,  computer  science  and  other  applied 

sciences,  is  developing  main  fields  of  applied  research  with  technology  transfer  in  robotics,  natural 

language  processing,  machine  learning,  computer  vision,  etc.  The  artificial  intelligence  can  be  the 

source of a self-propagating development of technology that acquiring new functionality from digital 

industry  and  information  and  communication  technology,  it  can  generate  a  vast  industrial  and  social 

change in economic systems  (cf., Geuna et al., 2017).  In this domain of AI, Machine Learning (ML) 

has  made  a  tremendous  progress  over  the  last  decades.  Many  scholars  believe  that  ML  is  capable  of 

making progress on any real-world problem. In the research field of machine learning, deep learning is 

a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large 

set  of  examples  that  demonstrate  the  desired  behavior,  removing  the  need  to  specify  rules  explicitly 

(cf., Goodfellow et al., 2018).   

In this context, the paper here shows the first applications of AI technology to cancer imaging that can 

generate  a  technological  paradigm  shift  in  oncology  for  improving  diagnostics  and  accelerating 

treatments of these diseases (cf., Kantarjian and Yu, 2015; Li et al., 2019). This study focused on case 

studies of new deep learning algorithms for detection of lung and breast cancer that are two of the most 

important  diseases  in  society.  These  case  studies  can  show  the  high  potential  of  path-breaking 

applications of AI in medicine that can generate an industrial and social change in clinics. Moreover, 

this  study  analyses  the  comparative  evolutionary  pathways  of  this  emerging  technology  for  three 

critical  cancers  (lung,  breast  and  thyroid)  to  explain  possible  drivers.  A  discussion  shows 

socioeconomic barriers to the diffusion of this new technology in medicine that can be generalized for

explaining the dynamics of this new technology in medicine and next applications in other sectors of 

economic system. 

Background 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the research field that studies and develops technological systems that can 

solve  complex  tasks  in  ways  that  would  traditionally  need  human  intelligence.  The  artificial 

intelligence  can  generate  a  vast  industrial  and  social  change  in  economic  systems  (cf.,  Geuna  et  al., 

2017).  

In this domain of AI, Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models 

that  computer  systems  use  to  effectively  perform  a  specific  task  without  using  explicit  instructions, 

relying  on  patterns  and  inference  instead  (Fig.  1).  Machine  learning  algorithms  build  a  mathematical 

model  based  on  sample  data,  known  as  "training  data",  in  order  to  make  predictions  or  decisions 

without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.     

Deep  learning  is  part  of  a  broader  family  of  machine  learning  methods  based  on  artificial  neural 

networks  (Madabhushi  et  al.,  2016).  Deep  learning  architectures  such  as  deep  neural  networks,  deep 

belief  networks,  recurrent  neural  networks  and  convolutional  neural  networks  have  been  applied  to 

fields  including  computer  vision,  speech  recognition,  natural  language  processing,  audio  recognition, 

social  network  filtering,  machine  translation,  bioinformatics,  drug  design,  medical  image  analysis, 

histopathological diagnosis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced 

results comparable to and in some cases superior to human experts (Litjens et al., 2016).  

This new technology, in particular, deep learning algorithms  can be applied for improving diagnostic 

accuracy and efficiency of detection of cancer.

Cancer is an organism which lives off a host organ, growing by bio-genetic-molecular mechanism. 9.6 

million  people  died  of  cancer  in  2018  –  more  than  from  HIV/AIDS,  malaria  and  tuberculosis 

combined. The incidence of cancer is estimated to double by 2035, with most of these cases expected to 

occur  in  low-to-middle  income  countries  (LMICs).  60%  of  cancer  cases  occur  in  LMICs,  and  75% 

cancer  deaths  occur  in  these  countries  (Prager,  2018).  In  many  LMICs,  breast  cancer  remains  the 

leading malignancy affecting women and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths (Bray et al., 2018).  

Table 1 shows that lung and breast cancer have the highest mortality rate worldwide (cf. also Parkin et 

al., 2005; Coccia, 2015).

The  R&D  in  oncology  is    supporting  the  convergence  of  different  research  fields,  such  as  genetics1,

technological  pathways  for  diagnostics  and  therapeutics  (Coccia,  2014,  2015a,  2016,  2018).  Clinical 

challenges  are  in  the  accurate  detection  and  characterization  of  cancers.  In  particular,  artificial 

intelligence (AI), generated by converging technologies in applied sciences, can support the qualitative 

interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, such as volumetric delineation of tumors as well 

as evaluation of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. In general, AI may automate

to efficiently apply anti-cancer treatments for patients.  

The goal of this investigation  

The  purpose  of  this  study  is  to  show  the  potential  of  Artificial  Intelligence  Technology  in  cancer 

imaging  to  distinguish  between  cancer,  metastases  or  normal  lung  tissue.  This  study  shows  two  case 

study  of  clinical  challenges  and  applications  of  AI  in  lung  and  breast  cancer.  Moreover,  this  study 

endeavors  to  analyze  evolutionary  pathways  of  this  AI  for  three  critical  cancers  (lung,  breast  and 

thyroid) to explain possible drivers.  

Importance 

Importance  of  the  paper  here  is  to  show  that  this  emerging  technology  applied  in  medicine  shows 

increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions 

in  cancer  care,  although  most  studies  evaluating  AI  applications  in  oncology  to  medical  imaging 

requires further assessment and validation for reproducibility and generalizability of results. 

Material and Methods: Study design and setting 

In order to show the potential of deep learning algorithms in cancer imaging, this study describes two case studies 

of AI technology applied for detection and characterization of lung cancer and lymph node metastases in women 

breast cancer.  

Moreover, to show the evolutionary pathways of AI technology and deep learning in the research field of cancer, 

this study considers data from ScienceDirect (2019) using the tool Advanced Search to find articles that have in 

title, abstract or keyword the following terms: 

  Artificial intelligence and lung cancer 

  Artificial intelligence and breast cancer 

  Artificial intelligence and thyroid cancer 

  Deep learning and lung cancer 

6 

 
  Deep learning and breast cancer 

  Deep learning and thyroid cancer 

The evolution of AI technology in cancer settings is measured with the number of articles from 1996 to 2018 for a 

comparative  analysis  of  the  trends  of  three  different  types  of  cancer  (lung,  breast  and  thyroid).  The  visual 

representation of trends is also used to detect the most appropriate model to estimate the relation of number of 

articles over time and assess the evolutionary growth of this new technology between different research fields of 

oncology (cf., Coccia, 2005, 2018a, 2019). 

The relation between number of articles per years of AI applied in cancer imaging of different cancers is estimated 

with  regression  analysis  (Ordinary  Least  Squares  Method)  using  an  exponential  model.  Outputs  of  statistical 

analysis are:  regression coefficients, adjusted R2, standard error of the estimate and analysis-of-variance table. 

In order to assess the evolutionary growth of AI technology applied to specific types of cancer (lung, breast and 

thyroid cancer) the following exponential equation is applied over 1996-2018 period:

 Artificial Intelligence and deep learning for detecting the typology  of lung cancer: a revolution in 

medicine 

Lung cancer is one of the main diseases in several countries and a leading cause of cancer death – both 

sexes – worldwide. Lung cancer is linked to several risk factors in society, such as smoking, passive 

smoking,  air  pollution,  etc.  Lung  cancer  can  be  either  small  cell  lung  cancer  or  no  small  cell  lung 

cancer (NSCLC), with the latter representing about 80% of the  cases. The mortality of lung cancer is 

very  high  and  the  five-year  survival  rate  of  patients  is  about  2–10%  (Coccia,  2014,  2012).  The 

detection of the type of lung cancer (e.g., adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc.), mutations 

(e.g.,  EGFR:  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor;  ALK:  anaplastic  lymphoma  receptor  tyrosine  kinase 

rearrangements)  and  sequential  mutations  (T790)  is  a  critical  process  in  diagnostics  to  select  the 

appropriate  therapy  that  can  be  conventional  chemotherapies,  target  therapies  such  as  gefitinib, 

erlotinib, etc., or new immune therapies, e.g., nivolumab, atezolizumab (cf., Coccia, 2014). This critical 

process affects the survival of patients (cf., Fig. 2).

Dempke et al. (2010), Lung Cancer, 67, p. 265  

Classification  and  mutation  of  lung  cancer  type  is  a  critical  diagnostic  process  because  the  available 

treatment  options, including conventional  chemotherapy and, more recently, targeted therapies, differ 

for lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinomas.  

Current technology for an accurate diagnosis and selection of treatment options is based on molecular 

biomarkers applied on lung biopsies and/or blood testing: this approach can diagnose lung cancer type 

and stage. This current technology has some negative effects. On the one side, patients have to receive 

an  invasive  surgical  intervention  for  tissue biopsies  or  to  do  liquid  biopsy  (e.g.,  blood)  and  wait  a 

certain time (about a month) before to have the diagnosis of cancer type and correct treatments, and the 

time in the presence of cancer is a critical variable for survival and, when possible, for healing. On the 

other  side,  hospitals  have  a  high  cost  with  these  approaches  that  require  appropriate  equipment  and 

specialized  personnel,  which  in  some  regions  are  scarce  or  overload  of  work  because  of  shrinking 

public lab and hospital budgets.  

New technology is based on artificial intelligence technology and some studies show that deep learning 

can  be  used  for  the  classification  of  breast,  bladder  and  lung  tumors  (Khosravi  et  al.,  2018).  In 
9 

 
 
 
particular, the development of new, inexpensive and more powerful artificial intelligence technologies 

has made possible the training of larger  and more complex neural  networks.  This  has  resulted in  the 

design  of  several  deep  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  that  are  capable  of  accomplishing 

complex  visual  recognition  tasks.  Coudray  et  al.  (2018)  show  that  medicine  can  benefit  from  deep 

learning  technology  by  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  that  not  only  outperforms  other 

methods, but also achieves accuracies to classify the type of cancer that are comparable to pathologists 

for  selecting  the  appropriate  therapy.  These  models  maintain  their  performance  when  tested  on 

independent datasets of frozen tissues as well as on  images obtained from biopsies. CNNs have been 

applied  with  regard  to  classification  of  lung  patterns  on  computerized  tomography  (CT)  scans,  with 

positive  results.  This  new  technology  is  due  to  Google  Corporation  that  in  2014  won  the  ImageNet 

Large-Scale Visual  Recognition  Challenge. The  ImageNet  project  is  a large visual  database designed 

for use in  visual object  recognition  software research. More than 14 million images have been hand-

annotated by the project to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images, 

bounding  boxes  are  also  provided.  ImageNet,  developing  the  GoogleNet  architecture,  increased  the 

robustness  to  translation  and  nonlinear  learning  abilities  by  using  microarchitecture  units  called 

inception.  Each  inception  unit  includes  several  nonlinear  convolution  modules  at  various  resolutions 

(cf., Russakovsky et  al.,  2015). Inception architecture is particularly useful for processing the data in 

multiple  resolutions,  a  feature  that  makes  this  architecture  suitable  for  medicine  and  in  particular  for 

pathology tasks. This complex neural network has already been successfully adapted to specific types 

of  disease  classifications  like,  skin  cancers  and  diabetic  retinopathy  detection  (Esteva  et  al.,  2016; 

Gulshan et al., 2016). Coudray et  al. (2018) have  developed a deep-learning model for the automatic 

analysis of tumor slides using publicly available whole-slide images available in The Cancer Genome 

Atlas  (TCGA).  These  scholars  trained  inception  v3  to  recognize  tumor  in  lung  versus  normal  tissue. 

After that, they tested the performance of these methods on the more challenging task of distinguishing 

10 

 
lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. They also evaluated the deep-learning model 

by training and testing the network on a direct three-way classification into the three types of images 

(normal  tissue,  lung  adenocarcinoma,  lung  squamous  cell  carcinoma).  Results  of  this  approach  are 

compared  to  the  evaluation  of  three  pathologists  (two  thoracic  pathologists  and  one  anatomic 

pathologist)  that  independently  classify  the  whole-slide  images  in  the  test  set  by  visual  inspection 

alone,  independently  of  the  classification  provided  by  TCGA.  Overall,  the  performance  of  deep 

learning  models  was  comparable  to  that  of  each  pathologist.  Hence,  new  artificial  intelligence 

technology, based on deep-learning models, can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or 

gene mutations in any cancer type with a save of time and costs; moreover, poor regions, with these AI 

technologies,  can  also  have  high  benefits  by  sending  the  digital  images  to  labs  of  other  countries, 

generating a reduction of current gap in healthcare between countries. 

 Deep learning for detection of metastases in women with breast cancer 

Breast  cancer  is  the  most  frequent  cancer  worldwide  among  women  (see  tab.  1).  Studies  based  on 

advanced countries show that the incidence of breast cancer has been increasing. It has been postulated 

that  breast  cancer  incidence  tends  to  be  higher  in  more  developed  countries  due  to  delayed 

childbearing, a higher use of hormone replacement therapy, a higher rate of screening, and improved 

tumor registries. Some studies have also argued that higher income countries may have higher fat diets 

and an increased rate of obesity, both correlated with higher breast cancer incidence rates. In general, 

scholars note that many Western populations have a higher incidence rate of breast cancer than regions 

in Africa and Asia (Coccia, 2013).  

Breast biopsies, like all types of cancer, are used to diagnose breast cancer type, stage and mutations. 

An  accurate  breast  cancer  staging  is  an  essential  task  performed  by  pathologists  to  inform  clinical 

management.  For  instance,  evaluation  of  the  extent  of  cancer  spread  by  histopathological  analysis  of 

sentinel axillary lymph nodes is an important part of breast cancer staging. The sensitivity of sentinel 
11 

 
axillary lymph nodes evaluation by pathologists, however, is sub-optimal because some studies show 

that pathology review by experts changed the nodal status in 24% of patients (Ehteshami Bejnordi et 

al.,  2017).  This  effect  is  due  to  the  difficulty  of  the  process  of  decision  making  of  human  behavior. 

Moreover, sentinel axillary lymph nodes evaluation is time-consuming and has a certain cost. In short, 

the high cost of exams and a period of more than one month to have breast cancer type, stage, etc. to 

decide the appropriate therapy, it can affect results of therapeutic treatments and survival of patients.  

The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with deep learning algorithms to whole-slide 

pathology images can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer and metastases (Lamy 

et al., 2019). Some scholars have assessed the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at 

detecting  metastases  in  tissue  sections  of  lymph  nodes  of  women  with  breast  cancer  and  compared 

results  with  pathologists’  diagnoses.  In  the  setting  of  a  challenge  competition,  some  deep  learning 

algorithms  achieved  better  diagnostic  performance  than  a  panel  of  11  pathologists  participating  in  a 

simulation  exercise  designed  to  mimic  routine  pathology  workflow;  in  short,  algorithm  performance 

was  comparable  with  an  expert  pathologist  interpreting  whole-slide  images  without  time  constraints 

(Ehteshami  Bejnordi  et  al.,  2017).  Hence,  this  experiment  has  shown  that  deep  learning  algorithms 

could identify metastases in sentinel axillary lymph nodes slides with 100% sensitivity, whereas 40% 

of the slides without metastases could be identified as such. This approach can significantly reduce the 

workload  of  pathologists  and  improve  the  management  decisions  on  whether  or  not  to  administer  a 

therapy, perform a surgical intervention, etc. Overall, then, this interesting result shows the potential of 

AI applied in cancer imaging for detection of lymph node metastases in women with breast cancer to 

improve processes of diagnosis and therapy of this and other critical cancers (cf., Ehteshami Bejnordi 

et al., 2017).

Figures 3 - 4 show that the evolution of AI in oncology has exponential patterns of  growth started in 

1990s and ongoing, with an acceleration mainly for lung cancer (cf., Fig. 5). Statistical analysis based 

on regression analysis shows that R2 adjusted of models indicates that more than 85% of variation in 

production  of  articles  in  AI  per  different  types  of  cancer  can  be  attributed  (linearly)  to  the  time  as 

predictor (Tabb. 2-4). In particular, estimated relationships and exponential rates of growth suggest that 

AI in cancer imaging of breast and lung have a faster growth than thyroid cancer.  

A  main  finding  of  this  study  is  the  recognition  that,  since  the  late  1990s,  the  sharp  increase  of 

technological trajectories of AI technology applied in cancer imaging seems to be driven by high rates

trajectories  in  AI  (cf.,  Coccia  and  Wang,  2014;  Coccia,  2016).  These  ground-breaking  technological 

trajectories  of  AI  are  paving  new  directions  and  clinical  challenges,  creating  the  foundations  for  a 

revolution in medicine that may lead to more effective diagnostic equipment in clinical settings in the 

not-too-distant future for a paradigm shift in clinical practice of pathology. 

Limitations 

The results and arguments of this study are of course tentative. In fact, the phenomenon is complex and 

analyses here are not sufficient to  explain the pros and cons of the patterns of AI in  cancer imaging, 

since we know that other things are often not equal over time and space. This study may form a ground 

work for development of more sophisticated studies and theoretical frameworks. Future efforts in this 

research field should provide more statistical evidence to substantiate the theoretical framework here. 

To reiterate, the study here is exploratory in nature and there is need for much more detailed research to 

shed  further  theoretical  and  empirical  light  on  technological  trajectories  supporting  the  clinical 

challenges and applications of AI technology in cancer imaging. This analysis shows general pathways 

of the evolution of AI in oncology, however the evolution of AI technology in medicine is a non-trivial 

exercise  because  it  depends  on  the  behavior  of  other  technologies  and  manifold  factors  of 

socioeconomic systems. In this context, Wright (1997, p. 1562) properly claims that: “In the world of 

technological change, bounded rationality is the rule.”  

Discussion and conclusion 

Bi  Wenya  et  al.  (2019)  argue  that  cancer  offers  a  unique  context  for  medical  decisions  based  on 

variegated forms of disease, individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their 

responses to treatment (cf., Rosenberg, 1969; Arthur, 2009; McNerney et al., 2011). Clinical challenges 

are  in  the  accurate  detection,  stage,  type  and  sub-type  of  cancers.  Radiographic  evaluation  of  cancer 

most commonly relies upon visual analysis of imaging, the interpretations of which may be augmented 

by  advanced  computational  analyses.  The  new  technology  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  can  improve 

16 

 
the  interpretation  of  cancer  imaging  by  pathologists  to  detect  volumetric  delineation  of  tumors  over 

time, mutations, and diffusion on other organs. AI may support the clinical process of interpretation of 

images to shift the clinical workflow of pathologists towards management decisions on whether or not 

to administer an intervention, and/or anticancer drugs, etc.  

In  medicine,  radiology,  having  converted  to  digital  images  about  30  years  ago,  is  well-positioned  to 

deploy AI for diagnostics. Several studies have shown considerable opportunity to support radiologists 

in  evaluating  a  variety  of  scan  types,  including  mammography  for  breast  lesions,  computed 

tomographic  scans  for  pulmonary  nodules  and  infections,  and  magnetic  resonance  images  for  brain 

tumors  including  the  molecular  classification  of  brain  tumors.  With  conversion  to  digital  images, 

radiology  reduced  costs  eliminating  film,  chemicals,  developers,  and  storage  of  the  films.  Moreover, 

radiology departments also solved problems related to loss of films and transport of films to where they 

are needed, for example, in operating rooms, emergency departments, and intensive care units. In short, 

digital images using computers have improved the quality, safety, and efficiency of radiologists in the 

management of disease. 

Pathology,  by  contrast  to  radiology,  has  been  late  to  adopt  digital  imaging  and  computer-assisted 

diagnostic technologies. The emergence of AI in health care, the reduced costs of digital data, and the 

availability of usable digital images are now in alignment for digital pathology to succeed.  

However, there are some barriers to the technological diffusion of AI in some medical fields. A major 

unresolved  issue  is  how  AI  will  be  implemented  in  routine  clinical  practice.  Numerous  intertwined 

problems will have to be addressed to overcome several significant obstacles for the diffusion of AI in 

pathology and other branches of medical science.  

Firstly, digital pathology based on AI may likely be costly at the initial phase of diffusion of this new 

technology  owing  to  additional  workflow,  including  personnel,  AI  must  demonstrate  improved 

efficiency, quality, and safety. These issues are the first and immediate barriers to a broad application 

17 

 
of  AI  in  pathology  and  clinical  practice.  However,  benefits  will  inevitably  come  from  the  use  of  AI 

with digital images and multiple data sets, for example, integrating genomic data and radiologic images 

to  further  enhance  the  value  of  combined  data  utilization  for  the  overall  health  care  system.  Recent 

examples with skin lesions, diabetic retinopathy, and radiology detection have highlighted the potential 

that AI provides to aid clinicians to improve quality, safety and diagnosis (Gulshan et al., 2016; Esteva. 

et al. 2016)  

Secondly, the cost of new technological devices  is an economic barrier. This cost is associated to the 

efficacy  and  efficiency  of  AI  in  pathology  that  have  to  be  clearly  demonstrated  to  government  and 

third-party  payers  (e.g.,  insurance  companies)  developing  reimbursement  strategies.  Although  some 

reimbursement codes exist for computational analyses in the USA, they are not widely used and often 

are rejected. With US national health care reimbursement trends moving to quality and safety metrics, 

the  recognition  of  AI  technology  as  part  of  reimbursement  strategies  that  reward  value-based  care, 

rather  than  fee  for  service  value-based  care,  would  provide  important  incentives  to  develop  and 

implement validated algorithms of AI in clinical practice. 

Thirdly, the critical  factor  for AI technology  is  human capital and education that will be the greatest 

challenge and will require the longest period to address. AI and other computational methods must be 

integrated  into  all  training  programs  of  the  schools  of  medicine  worldwide.  Future  generations  of 

pathologists and physicians must have technical skills comfortable to use digital images and other data 

in combination for accurate diagnosis.  

Overall, then, the promise of AI in health care is the delivery of improved quality and safety of care 

with  the  great  potential  of  reducing  the  inequality  in  the  access  to  healthcare  sector  between  people 

within  poor  and  rich  countries.  Put  otherwise,  AI  technology  in  medicine  can  increase  the 

democratization  of  the  health  care  system,  and  it  can  potentially  provide  value  in  many  economic 

sectors  generating  benefits  for  an  industrial  and  corporate  change  based  on  this  new  technological 

18 

 
paradigm  (cf.,  Coccia,  2010,  2014a).  For  instance,  radiologists  can  now  read  imaging  studies  from 

anywhere in the world at their home institution/office, bringing expert care to parts of the world that 

previously had limited expertise. Pathology has the opportunity to do the same with digital imaging and 

AI combined with  ICTs  can permit rapid  and accurate local care, also in  developing countries where 

there is a high burden of diseases and low medical equipment. 

To conclude, deep learning and in general AI have the opportunity to assist pathologists and physicians 

by improving the efficiency of their work, standardizing quality, and providing better prognostication. 

Although  workflow  of  pathologists  and  other  physicians  is  likely  to  change  with  AI  technology,  the 

contributions  of  pathologists,  and  in  general  of  humans,  to  patient  care  will  continue  to  be  critically 

important  to  treat  diseases.  Finally,  most  studies  evaluating  AI  in  oncology  and  other  branches  of 

medicinal sciences to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability 

of results. Further research is necessary in applied research to determine the feasibility of applying AI 

in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the AI could lead to improved care and outcomes 

compared with current technologies and medical assessments. Overall, then, the technological change 

based  on  technological  paradigm  shift  of  AI  in  medicine  seems  to  be  started  to  push  regional  and 

national economies in the next future.
