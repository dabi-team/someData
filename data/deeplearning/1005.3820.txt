ABSTRACT

The Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) will conduct deep PACS and SPIRE imaging of ∼40 massive clusters of galaxies. The strong gravitational
lensing power of these clusters will enable us to penetrate through the confusion noise, which sets the ultimate limit on our ability to probe the
Universe with Herschel. Here, we present an overview of our survey and a summary of the major results from our Science Demonstration Phase
(SDP) observations of the Bullet Cluster (z = 0.297). The SDP data are rich, allowing us to study not only the background high-redshift galaxies
(e.g., strongly lensed and distorted galaxies at z =2.8 and 3.2) but also the properties of cluster-member galaxies. Our preliminary analysis shows
a great diversity of far-infrared/submillimeter spectral energy distributions (SEDs), indicating that we have much to learn with Herschel about the
properties of galaxy SEDs. We have also detected the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) eﬀect increment with the SPIRE data. The success of this SDP
program demonstrates the great potential of the Herschel Lensing Survey to produce exciting results in a variety of science areas.

1. Introduction

With the successful launch and commissioning of the ESA’s
Herschel Space Observatory (Pilbratt et al. 2010), we are again
on the verge of making great new discoveries. Following
the breakthrough submillimeter/millimeter observations with
SCUBA and MAMBO (c.f., Blain et al. 2002), deep MIPS 24
µm observations carried out by the Spitzer Space Telescope have
enabled us to trace the evolution of infrared-luminous galaxies
up to z ∼ 3–4 (e.g., P´erez-Gonz´alez et al. 2005; Le Floc’h et al.
2005). However, the validity of all these Spitzer-based results
rests on the assumption that the total infrared luminosities of
high-redshift infrared galaxies can be estimated accurately by
sampling their rest-frame mid-infrared emission (e.g., the MIPS
24µm band samples the rest-frame 8 µm emission at z = 2).
Indeed, some Spitzer results have already questioned this as-
sumption, suggesting that the use of local galaxy spectral en-
ergy distribution (SED) templates may lead to overestimating
the total infrared luminosities of high-redshift galaxies (e.g.,
Papovich et al. 2007; Rigby et al. 2008). Herschel will allow us
to measure the total infrared luminosities of a large number of
high-redshift galaxies directly for the ﬁrst time.

With Herschel, confusion noise produced by a sea of blended
faint galaxies sets the ultimate limit on how deeply we can probe
the Universe. Once the source confusion sets in, it is no longer

⋆ Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments
provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with
important participation from NASA. Data presented in this paper
were analyzed using “The Herschel Interactive Processing Environment
(HIPE),” a joint development by the Herschel Science Ground Segment
Consortium, consisting of ESA, the NASA Herschel Science Center,
and the HIFI, PACS and SPIRE consortia.

possible to improve the detection limit by integrating longer.
This limitation is especially severe for SPIRE, which reaches
the confusion limit quickly.

To penetrate through the confusion limit, gravitational lens-
ing by massive galaxy clusters oﬀers a very powerful and yet
cheap solution (e.g., Blain 1997). Magniﬁcation factors of 2–4x
are quite common in the cluster core regions, and when a back-
ground source is strongly lensed (i.e., multiply imaged), mag-
niﬁcation factors can reach 10x–30x or more. Note that a mag-
niﬁcation factor of 10x corresponds to a factor of 100x saving
in observing time when the sensitivity is background-limited.
Therefore, a fairly short-integration image of a cluster core re-
gion would often reveal sources that are well below the detec-
tion limit of an ultra-deep blank-ﬁeld image. This method was
for example employed for the ﬁrst SCUBA observations of the
high-redshift Universe, which resulted in the identiﬁcation of the
substantial population of infrared-luminous galaxies at z > 1
(Smail et al. 1997).

The use of gravitational lensing is especially powerful at in-
frared/submillimeter wavelengths. This is because cluster cores
are dominated by early-type galaxies, which usually emit little
at these wavelengths. Therefore, infrared/submillimeter sources
detected in cluster cores are often background galaxies. In other
words, when observed at these wavelengths, massive cluster
cores virtually act as a transparent lens. Lensing studies in the in-
frared/submillimeter also beneﬁts from the steep galaxy counts
at these wavelengths.

These types of lensing surveys, however, have one limita-
tion: the small number of strongly lensed galaxies observed per
cluster. Although a large number of massive clusters have been
targeted by ground-based submillimeter/millimeter observations

(e.g., Smail et al. 2002; Chapman et al. 2002; Knudsen et al.
2008), the number of strongly lensed (i.e., multiply imaged)
galaxies discovered in these surveys remains small: for example,
the z = 2.5 galaxy in Abell 2218 (Kneib et al. 2004), the z = 2.9
galaxy in MS0451.6-0305 (Borys et al. 2004), the z = 2.8 galaxy
in the Bullet Cluster (Wilson et al. 2008; Gonzalez et al. 2009;
Rex et al. 2009; Johansson et al. 2010), and most recently the
exceptionally bright z = 2.32 galaxy in MACSJ2135-010217
(Swinbank et al. 2010). Based on these observations, we em-
pirically estimate the rate of ﬁnding such strongly lensed in-
frared/submillimeter galaxies to be roughly 1 in 10 with the
sensitivity of ground submillimeter observations (e.g., SCUBA,
LABOCA). Therefore, many tens of clusters need to be observed
to study a signiﬁcant number of strongly lensed galaxies.

2. The Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS)

As a Herschel Open-Time Key Program, we are conducting ex-
actly such a large lensing survey, targeting ∼40 massive clusters
of galaxies (“The Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS)”, PI - Egami,
272.3 hrs). Together with the PACS and SPIRE Guaranteed-
Time teams, which will observe 10 clusters (Altieri et al.
2010; Blain et al. 2010), we will obtain deep images with
PACS (Poglitsch et al. 2010) at 100 and 160 µm and SPIRE
(Griﬃn et al. 2010) at 250, 350, and 500 µm for a sample of
∼50 massive clusters as a legacy of the Herschel mission.

Target Selection — As the targets of the survey, we have
chosen the most X-ray-luminous clusters from the ROSAT X-
ray all-sky survey assuming that the most X-ray-luminous clus-
ters are also the most massive and therefore the most eﬀective
gravitational lenses. The majority of our targets come from the
sample of the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS) (e.g.,
Smith et al. 2010), which adopts the following selection criteria:
(1) LX > 2 × 1044 erg/s, (2) 0.15 < z < 0.3, (3) NHI < 7 × 1020
cm−2, and (4) −70 < δ < 70. In addition, some number of
clusters with spectacular lensed systems were included in the
sample. For the majority of our target clusters, we have well-
constrained accurate mass models, which have been constructed
through many years of intensive imaging/spectroscopic cam-
paigns with HST, Keck, and VLT telescopes. Other important
considerations were the availability of MIPS 24 µm images and
accessibility from ALMA for future follow-up observations al-
though these conditions were not always met.

Observing Parameters — Each target cluster is imaged by
both PACS (100 and 160 µm) and SPIRE (250, 350, and 500
µm). With PACS, we use the scan-map mode with the medium
speed (some early data were taken with the slow speed). The
scan leg lengths are 4′, cross-scan step is 20′′, number of scan
legs is 13. Each cluster is observed twice by orthogonal scan
maps (map orientation angles of 45◦ and 315◦) with 18 repeti-
tions each. The total observing time is 4.4 hrs per cluster with an
on-source integration time of 1.6 hrs (1500 sec/pixel).

With SPIRE, we use the Large Map mode with the nominal
speed. The scan direction was set to Scan Angles A and B. The
length and height of the map are set to 4′, which in practice will
produce a map of 17′×17′. With 20 repetitions, the total observ-
ing time per cluster is 1.7 hrs with an on-source integration time
of 0.6 hrs (17 sec/pixel).

Coordinated Programs — The Herschel Lensing Survey
is directly coordinated with a few other observing programs.
The most important is the Spitzer/IRAC Lensing Survey (PID
60034; “The IRAC Lensing Survey: Achieving JWST Depth
with Spitzer”, PI - Egami, 526 hrs), which is one of the Spitzer
Warm-Mission Exploration Science programs. This program

will obtain deep (5hr/band) Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 µm im-
ages of ∼50 massive clusters. By design, its target list is highly
overlapped with that of the HLS. Deep IRAC images will be
essential for identifying optically-faint high-redshift infrared-
luminous galaxies as well as for deriving accurate photomet-
ric redshifts. In addition, roughly half of the HLS clusters are
being imaged by HST/WFC3 through two on-going programs
(GO 11592: “Are Low-Luminosity Galaxeis Responsible for
Reionization?”, PI - Kneib, 43 orbits; MCT: “Through a Lens,
Darkly - New Constraints on the Fundamental Components of
the Cosmos”, PI - Postman, 524 orbits).

The Herschel Lensing Survey is also closely related to two
other Herschel Open-Time Key Programs: “LoCuSS: A Legacy
Survey of Galaxy Clusters at z = 0.2” (Smith et al. 2010) and
“Constraining the Cold Gas and Dust in Cluster Cooling Flows”
(Edge et al. 2010). The former will obtain wide (30′×30′) and
shallow PACS 100/160 µm maps of ∼30 massive galaxy clusters
at z ∼ 0.2, many of which are also targeted by the HLS. Note
that the HLS SPIRE maps cover a signiﬁcant part (the central
17′×17′) of the LoCuSS PACS maps, leading to a natural collab-
oration between the two teams. The latter program will study the
brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in a dozen cooling-ﬂow clus-
ters, and the HLS data will provide PACS/SPIRE photometry for
a much larger sample of BCGs.

3. Science Demonstration Target: The Bullet Cluster

In the Science Demonstration Phase (SDP), we observed the
Bullet Cluster at z = 0.297 (1E0657-56=RXCJ 0658.5-5556).
The Bullet Cluster was targeted because, (1) there is a strongly
lensed bright submillimeter/millimeter galaxy at z = 2.8 (see
the Introduction), (2) it has a large amount of ancillary data (see
Appendix A), and (3) it is in the continuous viewing zone of
Herschel.

3.1. Data Processing

Raw Herschel data products are reduced using the common
pipeline procedures distributed within the Herschel Interactive
Processing Environment (HIPE) (Ott 2010). Deviations from the
standard routines are described below.

PACS — The PACS observations were aﬀected by erroneous
ﬂashes of the calibration lamp at the end of each scan repetition.
These high intensity spikes in the detector time-streams were
followed by an exponential decay in the signal while the bolome-
ters re-thermalized. While the spike and a large fraction of the
decay occurred during the slew between repetitions, the bolome-
ters were not fully stabilized until after the beginning of the next
scan, resulting in a ∼10 % reduction of usable data.

The 1/f noise drift in the PACS bolometers was removed by
a high-pass ﬁlter. Before applying the ﬁlter, bright sources (>
5 σ) were masked to prevent Fourier ringing about their posi-
tions. These sources were selected from an unmasked ﬁrst-pass

of the 160 µm map, and the allocated mask size was propor-
tional to their signiﬁcance. High pass ﬁlter lengths of 30 and 40
time-stream frames were used for PACS 100/160 µm data re-
spectively. These lengths were selected to minimize residual 1/f
noise in the resultant maps without clipping power on the scale
of the PSF. The maps incorporate all data observed while the
telescope maintained the nominal scan speed (including some
turnaround data). The ﬁnal PACS maps have pixel sizes of 2′′
and 3′′ (100/160 µm).

SPIRE — In addition to the nominal scan legs (speed = 30′′
s−1), we include all turnaround data observed while the tele-
scope is scanning faster than 0.′′5 s−1, greatly increasing cov-
erage of the outer regions. Low-frequency drifts in the SPIRE
detectors were removed by subtracting the median value of the
nominal scan-speed data from each individual scan leg indepen-
dently. The ﬁnal SPIRE maps have pixel sizes of 6′′, 9′′, and 12′′
(250/350/500 µm respectively).

The properties of the processed PACS and SPIRE maps are

summarized in Table 1.

3.2. Overview of the BulletCluster SDP Data

Figure 1 shows the PACS and SPIRE images of the Bullet
cluster. Also shown are the Chandra, Magellan/IMACS,
Spitzer/IRAC & MIPS 24 µm, LABOCA and AzTEC images of
the same ﬁeld (see Appendix A for references). As expected, the
MIPS 24 µm observation goes deep enough to detect the counter-
parts for most of the PACS/SPIRE sources. This means that one
immediate goal of Herschel will be to determine the far-infrared
SEDs of 24 µm-detected sources. In fact, the MIPS 24 µm im-
age enables us to extract ﬂuxes from confused Herschel sources
accurately (P´erez-Gonz´alez et al. 2010). However, the most in-
teresting type of Herschel sources may be those without 24 µm

counterparts (such a source has not yet been identiﬁed in our
data).

In the Bullet Cluster ﬁeld, we have detected two signiﬁcantly
lensed galaxies, one at z = 2.79 and the other at z = 3.24
(Rex et al. 2010; P´erez-Gonz´alez et al. 2010). With magniﬁca-
tion factors of >54 and 11.3 (Paraﬁcz et al. 2010), respectively,
their intrinsic total infrared luminosities are < 5 × 1011L⊙ and
3.5×1011L⊙. Figure 1 shows the locations of these two and other
background galaxies studied. Note that only HLS can detect lu-
minous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; 1011<LT IR<1012 L⊙) at z>2–3
in both PACS and SPIRE data.

One major result coming out of this SDP program is the di-
versity of far-infrared/submillimeter SEDs seen with the z=0.3
cluster-member galaxies, z=0.35 background group galaxies,
and higher-redshift ﬁeld galaxies behind these two galaxy con-
centrations (Rawle et al. 2010; Rex et al. 2010). This is shown
in Figure 2, which compares the total infrared luminosities mea-
sured by ﬁtting the Rieke et al. (2009) SED templates to the
observed data points (Measured LT IR) against the total infrared
luminosity classes originally assigned to these SED templates
(Template LT IR). Although these two luminosities agree for
many of the cluster and background group members, Template
LT IR is signiﬁcantly lower than Measured LT IR for most of
the higher-redshift background galaxies. What this means is
that the shapes of the infrared/submillimeter SEDs of these
galaxies resemble those of lower-luminosity galaxies in the lo-
cal Universe. This result is consistent with the earlier ﬁnd-
ings by various Spitzer observations (e.g., Papovich et al. 2007;
Rigby et al. 2008). This also implies that these higher-redshift
star-forming galaxies have a larger amount of colder dust com-
pared to the local galaxies with similar infrared luminosities.

In the face of this SED diﬀerence, what is surprising is
the recent ﬁnding that the total infrared luminosities can be
estimated fairly well (at least up to z ∼ 1.5) if we use the
luminosity-dependent galaxy SED templates as observed locally
(Elbaz et al. 2010). We have conﬁrmed this ﬁnding with our
Bullet Cluster data. Despite this agreement, however, we have
also found that the kind of SED mistmatch seen in Figure 2
clearly exists in the data even at z < 1 (Rex et al. 2010). This
suggests that the good match between the observed and 24 µm-
derived total infrared luminosities does not necessarily mean that
the local SED templates are making good ﬁts to the observed
SEDs. A more detailed study of a larger sample is required to
resolve this issue.

Equally interesting is the discovery of cluster/group-member
galaxies that show large deviations in the opposite direction
(Rawle et al. 2010). In other words, the SEDs of these galax-
ies resemble those of higher-lumninosity galaxies in the local
Universe. These galaxies therefore are likely to have a larger
amount of hotter dust and a more pronounced infrared SED
peak compared to the local counterparts with similar infrared
luminosities. Similar galaxies were also found in other clusters
(Pereira et al. 2010; Smith et al. 2010), possibly suggesting that
this type of SEDs may be speciﬁc to the cluster environment.

Finally, we also report the ﬁrst detection of the Sunyaev-
Zel’dovich (SZ) eﬀect increment at 350 and 500 µm using the
SPIRE data (Zemcov et al. 2010). The measurements will allow
us to assess the relativistic correction to the SZ eﬀect.

smaller mid-infrared to far-infrared luminosity ratios). Galaxies
above the line have the opposite characteristics. The distribution
of the points along the Y axis is discreet because of the ﬁnite

a rapid progress in the near future. One immediate interest is
whether it can ﬁnd strongly lensed sources that are bright enough
to perform spectroscopy with Herschel. Ultimately, we will con-
struct a deﬁnitive sample of ∼50 lensing clusters with a variety
of multi-wavelength data and accurate mass models. Such a data
set can be further exploited by future facilities such as ALMA,
JWST, SPICA, and ground 30-meter class telescopes.
