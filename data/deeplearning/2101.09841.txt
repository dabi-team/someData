Abstract—This study addresses the current issues in on-
line assessments, which are particularly relevant during the
Covid-19 pandemic. Our focus is on academic dishonesty
associated with online assessments. We investigated the
prevalence of potential e-cheating using a case study and
propose preventive measures that could be implemented. We
have utilised an e-cheating intelligence agent as a mechanism
for detecting the practices of online cheating, which is
composed of two major modules: the internet protocol (IP)
detector and the behaviour detector. The intelligence agent
monitors the behaviour of the students and has the ability
to prevent and detect any malicious practices. It can be
used to assign randomised multiple-choice questions in a
course examination and be integrated with online learning
programs to monitor the behaviour of the students. The
proposed method was tested on various data sets conﬁrming
its effectiveness. The results revealed accuracies of 68% for
the deep neural network (DNN); 92% for the long-short term
memory (LSTM); 95% for the DenseLSTM; and, 86% for the
recurrent neural network (RNN).

I. INTRODUCTION

O NLINE courses have become a feasible option in

education. This platform is increasingly recognised
in colleges and higher education institutions such as uni-
versities, and even implemented in elementary schools
– for example, during the Covid-19 pandemic. However,
the detached nature of online education raises concerns
about the potential risks of academic dishonesty, partic-
ularly when students sit for exams at remote locations,
in the absence of the disciplinary procedures that are
typically employed at examination centres [1], [2], [3].
There is exponential growth in online education, in terms
of both student enrolment and the corporate market it
entails. However, existing literature indicate a prevalence
of online cheating, which involves academic dishon-
esty by both the faculty and the students [4], [5], [6].
Although online education provides valuable learning
opportunities for people who do not have access to
traditional quality education due to time or physical

constraints, its credibility may be compromised if issues
of academic dishonesty are not resolved.

Although online courses have increasingly gained mo-
mentum during the Covid-19 pandemic, it should not be
established as an accepted mode of education without
due diligence in the event of a possible resurgence of
the pandemic. For instance, the detached nature of online
courses has raised signiﬁcant concerns as prevalence of
e-cheating has been reported [6]. This is because, while
traditional sit-down examinations are invigilated, the
same cannot be said for the remotely conducted online
examinations. Consequently, the credibility of online
courses could become questionable.

The present study aims to address the current limita-
tions of cheating at online examinations by proposing
artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) techniques via the internet
protocol (IP) network detector and deep learning-based
behaviour detection agent. The research was conducted
as a case study, the outcomes of which offer avenues of
further improving the intelligent tutoring system. The
main contributions of this study are as follows:

• We analysed the limitations of the current online
education system, with particular focus on cheating
at online examinations.

• We proposed an e-cheating intelligence agent that
is based on the relationship model for detecting
online cheating using AI techniques. Speciﬁcally,
we implement an IP detector and a behaviour
detector that utilises the long short-term memory
(LSTM) network with a densely connected concept,
namely DenseLSTM. As AI techniques have evolved
rapidly, and has been widely applied in recent years,
we utilised state-of-the-art AI techniques for the
online exams, which may provide useful insights
that contribute to the research area of an intelligent
tutoring system.

• We created a new dataset for this study, which is
presented in [7]. The records were collected across
online exams that were conducted in environments
that were highly unregulated (e.g., in the absence
of any implemented applications for detecting or
preventing e-cheating) during mock, mid-term, and
ﬁnal-term exam periods. The database included
training and testing schemes for performance anal-
ysis and evaluation.

The paper is organised as follows: Section II analyses
the limitations of the existing online education system
for preventing online cheating. The proposed framework
is presented in Section III and the detailed database
information is presented in Section IV. Section V dis-
cusses the experimental results, and the conclusions are
summarised in the last section.

II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS

Students engaging in cheating during examinations is
a prevalent phenomenon worldwide, regardless of the
country’s stage of development. To this end, early work
done by Roger [8], suggested installing the proctoring
security program into computers, which enables con-
tinuous monitoring of each student’s computer screen
on an instructor control view. Similarly, Cluskey et al.
[9], proposed an eight-step model for reducing potential
cheating by students, which incorporated several cri-
teria that were contributory to the exam, such as the
duration of the exam, the time allocated for answering
each question, etc. However, this model has limitations
given that it required the students to use a special
browser in order to access the examination applications,
and the consequent necessity for the teacher to change
the questions every semester by using the randomised
approach [9].

A. Network Security Methods

The rapid growth of wireless communication technol-
ogy enables users to remotely access digital resources
at any time. Many researchers have focused their work
on strengthening the security of online exam protocols
to counter the security breaches that could occur in the
education sector. Bella et al. [10] proposed a new protocol
for online examinations, which bypassed the necessity
of involving a trusted third party to maintain disci-
pline. The proposed protocol merged oblivious transfer
and visual cryptography that allowed both the students
and invigilators to generate aliases. These would only
be revealed during the exam, thereby maintaining the
anonymity of the students.

A literature survey by Ullah et al. [11] discusses the
security threats that have been encountered in the past,
which are associated with online examinations. They
indicated collusion to an be increasingly challenging
threat, which typically involves the collaboration of a
third party who assists the student by impersonating
him or her online. A further study conducted by the
same authors [12] revealed the potential mechanisms
of security attacks in online cheating. They monitored
31 online participants at an examination, where they
assessed the students’ behaviour by employing dynamic
proﬁle questions in an online course. The results pointed
out that students who cheated by impersonation shared
most of the information using a mobile device, and con-
sequently, their response time was signiﬁcantly different
to those who did not cheat.

A recent literature review [13] highlights the signif-
icance of advanced technology in enabling the use of
techniques such as anomaly detection for addressing
the growing concerns of e-cheating. The authors re-
viewed the current work under ﬁve dimensions: network
data type, network trafﬁc, intrusion detection, detection
methods and open issues. They also emphasised the
accurate identiﬁcation of an individual to be crucial in
developing any intrusion detection system that is aimed
at restricting their access within the network trafﬁc.

B. Plagiarism Detection Methods and Tools

Plagiarism detection tools are popular in course eval-
uations for identifying the unpermitted use of written
content by students. For instance, the code plagiarism
tool can be used to calculate the similarity between
a pair of programs using a token sequence [14] and
dependency graph features [15]. Nonetheless, these code
plagiarism detection techniques can be circumvented by
modifying the code syntax. In order to counter such
deceit, Herrera et al. [16] implemented a new language-
agnostic methodology, which prevents plagiarism in
programming courses without the necessity for code
comparison or professor intervention.

A study carried out by Pawelczak [17] examined
the achievements and opinions of students over ﬁve
years regarding the automated evaluation system used
in plagiarism detection in programming courses. The
data comprised of 228 records, where the analysis was
based on tokenizing and averaging several features of
the source code. The study revealed a limitation in the
method: given that plagiarism detection is dependent on
the thresholding value that is used to calculate the level
of similarity in the content, thresholding issues in this
approach could give rise to false measures of prevention.

C. Biometrics Methods

It is vital to ensure the presence of an examinee
throughout the entire examination. The invigilation of
online examinations is difﬁcult, and the absence of a
physical invigilator gives rise to a higher possibility of
suspicious conduct as well as cheating attempts taking
place. Several strategies have been proposed to counter
such fraudulent activities during examinations including
the monitoring of yaw angle variations, audio presence
and active window capture. For instance, Prathish et al.
[18] and Narayanan et al. [19] proposed to implement the
features of point extraction and yaw angle detection that
could assist the instructors in monitoring the students
during online examinations. Similarly, Wlodarczyk et al.
[20] presented the head pose detection method, which
uses the precise localisation of face landmark points that
help in identifying the user’s direction of gaze as well
as facial recognition.

Hu et al. [21] proposed a novel method of monitor-
ing the students’ behaviour during online assessments,

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, JAN 2021

3

which involved identifying the relevant relationship be-
tween the image of a student’s face and his or her
corresponding pose. Mahadi et al. [22] suggested that
the combination of facial recognition and keystroke dy-
namics could be the best classiﬁers for behavioural-based
biometric authentication. In similar a study, Ghizlane
et al. [23] primarily focused on the identity and access
management of students and staff, where they could
use a customised model of a smart card-based digital
identity control system for accessing academic services,
especially online evaluations. This service would help in
ensuring that the security of the institute could manage
the authorisation of individuals in accessing various
types of networks.

Ghizlane et al. [24] also examined the combined use
of smart cards and face recognition to authorise and
monitor applicants while online exams are conducted
in detecting any suspicious behaviour or cheating at-
tempts. They recommended a system that stored a log of
photographs taken of each applicant that sits the exam,
which could be later checked by administrators. Another
study conducted by Garg et al. [25] proposed using
the convolutional neural network and the Haar cascade
classiﬁer to detect the faces of the exam candidates and
to tag these with an associated name that is given at
the time of registration, which allows the system to keep
track of the applicants’ movements within the timeframe
of the exam.

In current online examination settings, biometric au-
thentication is considered to be one of the most pop-
ular techniques in verifying the identiﬁcation of the
candidates [26], [27]. In contrast to face-to-face exami-
nations, online assessments do not involve proctors or
invigilators, and can be held in different and uncon-
trolled remote environments. Consequently, establishing
authentication goals in online exams are vital in order to
verify the identity of the students, as it plays a key role in
online security [28], [29]. In a study which focused on en-
hancing the security of online examinations, Mathapati et
al. [30] proposed utilising personal-images as graphical
passwords. They suggested using digital pictures that
were captured from live video as personalised physical
tokens.

Ramu et al. [31] and Mungai et al. [32] reviewed the
importance of keystrokes dynamics in preserving secu-
rity in online examinations. The proposed architecture
used a three-stage authentications process, in which the
stages were described as statistical, machine learning
and logic comparison. Initially, when an applicant signs
into the system, his/her typing style is automatically
recorded, for which a template is generated. These tem-
plates are subsequently used as a guide to continuously
monitor the authenticity of the users, based on several
parameters: their dwell time (the time difference be-
tween keypress and release); the ﬂight time (the time
passed between the key release and keypress of two
consecutive keystrokes); and, the typing speed, for better
precision and robustness. Ananya and Singh [33] also

introduced the keystroke dynamics approach, in which
the system does not require any pre-registration and has
the capability of keeping track of each student’s typing
pattern during the exercise session itself.

D. Summary

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many academic insti-
tutes, schools and universities have switched to online
teaching, and consequently, online examinations have
become a common trend, especially due to its ﬂexibility
and usability within different environments [34], [35],
[36]. Several studies offer diverse approaches to mitigate
cheating at online examinations that largely focus on
behaviour analysis, technology innovation, etc. [37], [38],
[39]. However, the detection of suspicious behaviour
of candidates at online examinations still remains one
of the major challenges in fully utilising online edu-
cation platforms. In this context, we offer a solution
for detecting abnormal behaviour of students at online
examinations, and thereby for preventing e-cheating, by
investigating the use of an AI intelligence agent as a real-
time live proctor. The AI intelligence agent was designed
utilising network protocol detection and deep learning
approaches.

III. METHODOLOGY

We designed an online examination as a case study,
which consisted of multiple-choice questions, in which
an e-cheating intelligent agent was used to detect any
potential cheating. The e-cheating intelligence agent con-
sists of two main agents: the network IP detection agent
(described in Section III-A) and the behaviour detection
agent (described in Section III-B). Fig. 1 illustrates the
architecture of the proposed system.

A. Network IP Detection Agent

Emerging security analysis has raised awareness of
the challenges of online learning and has captured the
rapidly increasing attention of researchers of developing
new e-learning assessment methods. The present issues
arises from the inadequate understanding of the security
dataset that is stored through network protocols and
the analyses of data that use semantic association and
inference methods [40].

The proposed model is a two-stage process (see Fig. 1).
In the ﬁrst stage, we propose applying an IP detection
agent to ﬁlter any deceitful activity. For example, the
system can monitor the exam candidates’ IP addresses.
Most routers allocate dynamic IP addresses, which are
numerical labels that are speciﬁcally assigned to each
device that is connected to a computer network. This
would enable the system to issue an alert if a student
changed their computer device or their initial location.
In the proposed method, there would be several sets
of exam questions (such as Set A, B, C, etc.). At the
start of an examination, after veriﬁcation, a student is

randomly assigned a set of questions for assessment
(e.g., Set A). If any abnormal behaviour is detected, the
system changes the questions randomly to another Set
(e.g., Set B). Similarly, if an incoming student enters
his/her credential to access the online exam platform
using an IP address that was previously recorded in the
IP list as suspicious, the system will generate a different
set of questions to the student. Algorithm 1 summarises
the entire process of the IP detection agent.

end

end

B. Behaviour Detection Agent

We devised a behaviour detection agent via a deep
learning approach to monitor and analyse the behaviour

of all the students. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the agent
would alert the instructors and immediately reassign
the remaining questions with a new set of questions
only in instances where abnormal behaviour is detected
in the students during the examinations. The following
sub-sections provide a more detailed explanation of the
behaviour detection agent.

1) Data pre-processing: Before training the behaviour
detection agent, we ﬁrst transformed each raw data
record into a one-hot encoded feature, which deﬁnes
the behaviour of the student during the examination.
For instance, each raw data record contains the results
of the 20 multiple-choice questions, the total time (in
minutes) taken for answering the examination, and the
ﬁnal score. In this study, we deﬁned the one-hot encoded
input feature as: R ∈ 1 × N, where N = 23. The
ﬁrst 20 elements represent the given answers of the 20
questions as: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, · · · , 0] where the values 1
and 0 reﬂect whether the answer is correct or incorrect,
respectively. The last three elements deﬁne the speed
of answering the questions, whether fast, normal or
slow. The last three elements are deﬁned as the speed
of answering questions as fast, normal or slow. Fig. 2
summarises data pre-processing, where the raw data is
processed into one-hot encoded features.

Next, we explored how we could label the data record
to identify the students’ behaviours. Initially, we la-
belled the records as one of two major categories of
behaviours: ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’. In deﬁning ‘abnor-
mal’ behaviour, we assessed the speed at which the
students have answered in instances where the questions
have been answered 90% correctly, according to one-hot
encoded features. If the speed was represented as too

dataset.

fast or too slow, they were labelled as ‘abnormal’; in
comparison, the rest of the samples were considered as
‘normal’.

When deﬁning the speed of answering questions two
factors were considered: the number of questions an-
swered and the level of difﬁculty of each question. For
example, we observed that if the level of difﬁculty of
a question was deﬁned as ‘easy’, most of the students
could answer it within 10 to 20 seconds; if it was deﬁned
as ‘moderate’ or ‘high’, they required 30 to 40 seconds
or 1-2 minutes, respectively. However, the speciﬁcs of
such labelling criteria are dependent on the subjects or
the courses that are evaluated.

2) DenseLSTM: We propose applying a deep learning
network, namely DenseLSTM as the behaviour detection
agent. The LSTM network was introduced by Hochre-
iter and Schmidhuber [41], and allows modelling the
problem with sequential dependencies data, such as
time-series data, natural language processing, behaviour
analysis, etc. In our work, we propose to use a densely
connected approach with the LSTM network to extract
better feature representation for abnormal behaviour
prediction.

Fig. 3 illustrates the architecture of the DenseLSTM,
which consists of a convolutional (conv) layer, two LSTM
blocks and a transition layer. The concept of the densely
connected network was originally proposed by Huang et
al. [42] for image classiﬁcation. The network introduces
direct connections from any layer to all the subsequent
layers, which improves the information ﬂow between
them by creating a different connectivity pattern. One
explanation for this occurrence is the enhanced access
each layer has to all the preceding feature maps in its
block due to the dense connectivity, and the “collective
knowledge” it thereby provides the network.

In the LSTM block, the LSTM cell layer decides what
information will be discarded from the cell state. As
the layer could potentially inadvertently omit useful
information, we have implemented the concept of a
densely connected network, which keeps the information
together instead of deciding “what to forget and which
new information should be added.” The features can
be accessed from anywhere within the network, and

unlike in traditional network architectures, there is no
requirement to replicate them from layer to layer. The
network used in this study is expected to collect rich
information while maintaining a low complexity of fea-
tures, which can result in achieving a better classiﬁcation
performance.

transition layer is implemented in the ﬁrst block that
performs 1 × 1 conv and avgpool operations, where 1 × 1
conv is deﬁned as the ﬁlter size of the conv layer that is
1 × 1. Table I tabulates the architecture of the proposed
network.

In the training stage, we implement a softmax cross-
entropy L of logit vector and the respective encoded

where L, E and C denote class labels, the number of

tively.

In summary, we have devised a network using the
concept of a densely connected approach to extract better
feature representation and to strengthen the feature acti-
vation of the network for predicting potential e-cheating.

IV. DATASET

We have designed a new dataset, namely, the 7wiseup
behaviour dataset, which consists of 94 student records
that were acquired from different end-of-term exami-
nations at Pyeongtaek University in South Korea. All
records were collected during the Spring semester, 2020.

A. Collection Setup

In order to create our database, we utilised an e-class
learning management system (LMS), which is adopted
by the university. The exam module is crucial for the
LMS system, which can be used to set up quizzes
and exam questions. The module allows the lecturers
to ﬁll out forms that outline vital information such as
the exam name, time allocations (opening time, closing
time and length of the exam), grades, whether shufﬂing
of questions is allowed, etc. They can add questions
from the question bank, using various in-built options
for quiz/test settings including the type of examina-
tion questions – whether multiple-choice, true/false and
short answers, and also allocate marks for each question.

The system further enables the staff to add resources
including images or links, and to provide general feed-
back. Once the exam is completed and submitted, the
system automatically assigns marks for the questions
based on the answers that were pre-determined by the
staff. Finally, the system generates a CSV ﬁle compiling a
list of all the submissions and the candidates’ records in-
cluding their names, IDs, the answers for each question,
the scores for each question, the grades, the total time
taken for completion (in minutes), and the IP addresses.
Table II shows several records of our dataset.

B. Training and Benchmarking Protocols

For training and benchmarking protocols, 94 records
each were obtained from mock-exams, and the mid- and
ﬁnal-term exams, respectively. Notably, the records that
were used for the training and benchmarking proto-
cols did not overlap. When designing the protocol to
develop or train our model, we divided the data set
from mock-exams for training and cross-validations at a
ratio of 80:20. In addition, due to the imbalanced nature
of the dataset, we have applied a data augmentation
approach that generated an additional 60 samples repre-
senting cases of abnormal behaviour. In the benchmark-
ing scheme, the task was to determine the behaviour
of the examinees based on their manner of answering
questions.

V. EXPERIMENTS

We conducted several experiments to evaluate the
relative performance between our network and other
benchmark networks. All the conﬁgurations used for the
networks are described in Section V-A and the experi-
mental results are presented in Section V-B.

A. Experimental Setup

1) Conﬁguration of DenseLSTM: The proposed network
was implemented using TensorFlow [44]. For the conﬁg-
uration, we applied a learning rate of 1.0 × 10−5 and
the AdamOptimizer [45], where the weight decay and
momentum were set to 1.0 × 10−4 and 0.9, respectively.
In the experiments, the batch size was set to 32 and
the training was carried out across 250 epochs. The

JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. XX, NO. XX, JAN 2021

training was conducted using our database according to
the protocols set out in Section IV-B; it was performed
by the NVidia RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

2) Conﬁguration of Benchmark Networks: We selected
several deep networks to evaluate the performance of
the behaviour study: the Deep Neural Network (DNN)
[46], the LSTM [47] and the Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN) [48]. These approaches have been successfully
applied in behaviour studies previously [49] and [50].
When conducting the experiments, we tried our best
to implement and ﬁne-tune the LSTM and RNN from
scratch following the recommendations of [47] and [48],
respectively. The training was also conducted using our
database and following the protocols in Section IV-B. All
the training processes were performed using the NVidia
RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

B. Experimental Results

In order to evaluate the performance of our network
in a real-life scenario and in a more objective manner,
we used the mid-term and ﬁnal-term examinations data
and compared our experimental results with the results
obtained from other benchmark approaches. As shown
in Table III, of the different approaches tested, the highest
accuracy, of 95.32%, was achieved by our system for
overall performance, followed by the second-best, the
LSTM system, which reached an accuracy of 91.89%. Our
model outperformed the existing benchmark models by
3.5% in accuracy demonstrating its superiority to the
other benchmark approaches.

In identifying the source of the improvements in our
system, we observed that the accuracy of our network
was higher than 92% in analysing the behaviour of stu-
dents during online exams for both mid-term and ﬁnal-
term examinations, with values of 97.77% and 92.86%,
respectively (as shown in Table III). The LSTM system,
which was the second-best, demonstrated comparable
accuracy scores of 94.49% for the mid-term and 89.29%
for the ﬁnal-term examinations. In contrast, the perfor-
mance of the DNN approach was low with an accuracy
score of 82.74% for the mid-term examination, and only
52.68% accuracy for the ﬁnal-term examination. In ad-
dition, our investigations of the DNN system revealed
error rates of 2.23% and 7.14% for mid-term and ﬁnal-
term examinations, respectively, which was associated
with false prevention that occurred as a result of several
students being extremely slow to select their answers.

With the intention of reﬁning our system further, we
focused on characterising its sensitivity and speciﬁcity
by applying the parameters, Receiver Operating Charac-
teristics (ROC) and Area Under the ROC curve (AUC).
This enables summarising the trade-off between the true
and false positive rates of a model by using different
probability thresholds. As shown in Fig. 4, our network
(DenseLSTM) achieved the highest AUC values of 0.9972
and 0.9760, for the mid-term and ﬁnal-term examina-
tions, respectively. The LSTM and RNN systems also

demonstrated a similar performance for the mid-term
examination by achieving AUC values of 0.9870 and
0.9810, respectively. However, the AUC values achieved
by both these approaches for the ﬁnal-term examinations
were lower than 0.94. These comparisons demonstrate
that our network has outperformed most of the other
benchmark networks for classifying normal and abnor-
mal behaviours of students at online examinations with
low sensitivity and high speciﬁcity.

C. Discussion

Our experimental analysis and results demonstrate
that the proposed approach can successfully address the
challenges pertaining to cheating at online examinations,
and in preventing such abnormal behaviour of students.
The proposed intelligence agent framework utilises the
IP detector and the DenseLSTM network, which enable
monitoring the students through network protocols and
behaviour analysis to identify any potential plagiarism.
As the examinations were evaluated over two terms,
our results have shown a consistently high accuracy. The
results conﬁrm the performance of the proposed network
to be superior in detecting abnormal behaviour at online
examinations due to its ability to better maintain “col-
lective knowledge” from the extracted features within
the subsequent layers, instead of “forgetting” the infor-
mation. This supports our assumption that DenseLSTM
performs better than other neural networks.

VI. CONCLUSION

Online learning is a new and exciting opportunity for
students and education institutions, which is gaining
momentum. In today’s environment, e-learning presents
unique opportunities, but also unique challenges. The
primary area of concern in online assessments is aca-
demic dishonesty in the form of cheating, which stu-
dents attempt to achieve employing numerous avenues.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of the education insti-
tutions to implement more effective measures to detect
academically dishonest behaviour. This paper discusses
the concerns around online cheating and offers plau-
sible mechanisms of monitoring and curtailing such
incidences using AI technology.

We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the pro-
posed e-cheating intelligent agent, which successfully in-
corporates IP detector and behaviour detector protocols.

The agent has been tested on four deep learning algo-
rithms: the DNN, DenseLSTM, LSTM and RNN, using
two exam datasets (mid-term and ﬁnal-term exams). The
highest overall accuracy of 95.32% was achieved by the
DenseLSTM. The average accuracy rate is 90%, which
is sufﬁcient to alert the lecturers to review the exam
result of concern. We intend to continue developing web-
based e-cheating monitoring systems in the future. Such
systems would potentially provide a user-friendly inter-
face for tasks such as uploading exam results, choosing
algorithms and other features. The system will be tested
among lecturers of various subjects, where they would
be able to set speciﬁc features that they wish to monitor
and for detecting abnormal behaviour of students. The
existing agent will be improved based on their feedback.
