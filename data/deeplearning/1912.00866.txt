Abstract 

Deep-Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a therapy used in conjunction with medication to help alleviate the motor symptoms of 
Parkinson’s Disease (PD). However, the monitoring and adjustment of DBS settings is tedious and expensive, requiring long 
programming appointments every few months. We investigated the possible correlation between PD motor score severity and 
digitally extracted patient voice features to potentially aid clinicians in their monitoring and treatment of PD with DBS to 
eventually enable a closed-loop DBS system. 5 DBS PD patients (4 bilateral STN, 1 bilateral GPI) were enrolled. Voice 
samples were collected for various voice tasks (single phoneme vocalization, free speech task, sentence reading task, 
counting backward task, categorical fluency task) for DBS in ON and OFF states. Motor scores per the Unified Parkinson’s 
Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were also collected for DBS ON and OFF states.  Voice samples were then analyzed to 
extract voice features using publicly available voice feature library sets, and statistically compared for DBS ON and OFF. Of 
the feature categories explored (Acoustic, Prosodic, Linguistic) 6 features from the GeMAPS feature set for acoustic features 
demonstrated significant differences with DBS ON and OFF (p < 0.05). Prosodic features such as pause length/percentage 
were found to be negatively correlated with increased motor symptom severity. Non-significant differences were found for 
linguistic features. These findings provide preliminary evidence for acoustic and prosodic speech features to act as potential 
biomarkers for PD disease severity in DBS patients. We hope to explore further by expanding our data set, identifying other 
features and applying potential machine learning models, working towards a closed-loop DBS system that can auto-tune itself 
based on changes in a patient’s voice.

1. Introduction: 

1.1 Parkinson’s and Deep-Brain Stimulation: 

    Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common 
neurodegenerative disease, expected to affect 930,000 
patients in the US by 2020, projecting to over 1.3 million 
people by 2030 [1]. Known for its motor symptoms of 
muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor, PD also effects the 
fundamental frequency , jitter, and harshness of voice [2]. 
Along with medication, PD can be treated using Deep-Brain 
Stimulation (DBS), where an electrode is surgically 
implanted into the brain, delivering electric current to 
alleviate symptoms. Specific targets for DBS include the 
sub-thalamic nuclei (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPI) 
in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia thalamocortical 
circuit, the pathway contributing to the inhibition of 
movements associated with PD pathology [3]. The best DBS  
candidates for PD include patients with significant responses 
to levodopa, and lack of comorbidities, particularly cognitive 
and surgically related [4].  An estimated 150,000 patients 

with movement disorders (PD, essential tremor, etc.) have 
been treated with DBS in the United States [5]. 

1.2 Voice Biomarker Closed-Loop DBS: 

    DBS treatment is an arduous and expensive process. 
Patients must come in every few months to have their DBS 
settings carefully adjusted with the progressions of their 
symptoms. While modern DBS devices have wireless 
charging capabilities, older devices must have their batteries 
surgically replaced every few years. Closed-loop DBS refers 
to a system which makes adjustment to the DBS signal 
without the need for manual adjustment. This could reduce 
the need for patients to come into clinic, and prolong the 
battery life of the function generators on their DBS devices. 
Closed-loop DBS has been explored using physiological 
feedback loops, particularly with motor cortex 
electrocorticography (ECoG), electroencephalography 
(EEG), and wearable wrist accelerometer as physiological 
sensors [6]&[7]. Previously, our lab has identified methods 
to utilize digital biomarkers extracted from voice samples, to 

	
build models that can predict presence of PD [8]. Other work 
has shown changes in vocal motor mechanisms of PD with 
DBS ON and OFF [9], and changes in the quality, intensity 
and prosody of patient voice for PD amongst different DBS 
settings [10]. We aim to identify objective and quantifiable 
voice features that correlate with DBS turned ON and OFF in 
PD patients, that we could potentially apply to use as 
feedback for closed-loop system DBS.  

part III is a rating tool used to determine the severity of motor 
symptoms  (e.g.  muscle  rigidity,  posture,  finger  tapping, 
tremor etc.) Each item is rated on a scale of 0-4, with 4 being 
the most severe. The UPDRS Part III has a total of 33 items 
for a total score range of 0-132. Scores recorded were used to 
demonstrate  the  change  in  PD  motor  symptom  severity  for 
DBS ON and OFF. 

2.3 Voice Tasks: 

Voice 

recordings  were  collected  using  smartphone 
microphone, located an arm’s length away from the mouth. 5 
distinct voice tasks for DBS ON and OFF were collected, for 
a  total  of  10  voice  recordings  for  each  patient.  These  voice 
tasks  included  10  seconds  of  single  phoneme  sound,  /ˈɑ/, 
pronounced “ahhh”, 30 second free speech task, standardized 
sentence  reading  task,  counting  backwards  task,  and  a  30 
second categorical fluency task – having participants name as 
many animals as they could in the allotted time. Transcripts 
for  free  speech  and  categorical  fluency  tasks  were  also 
generated for text analysis.  

2.4 Feature Extraction: 

Voice  samples  were  extracted  for  features  using  publicly 
available feature extraction pipelines [13] and [14]. Acoustic 
features extracted were derived from the Geneva Minimalistic 
Acoustic Parameter Set (GeMAPS), consisting of 88 acoustic 
voice  features,  such  as  fundamental  frequency, 
jitter, 
shimmer, etc. [15]. The second feature set extracted was for 
prosody  features,  which  included  7  features  looking  at 
speech/pause  characteristics  [16].  Patient  free  speech  tasks 
were  used  to  extract  Linguistic  Features  of  Complexity  set, 
including  7  features  identifying  lexical  richness  [16],  and 
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) set, including 37 features 
identifying linguistic repeats, consonant, and vowel use [17]. 

2.5 Data Analysis: 

To identify significant changes for DBS ON compared to 
off,  paired  T-tests  were  performed  on  all  extracted  features. 
Pearson  correlation  coefficients  were  generated  to  identify 
correlation  between  prosody  features  and  motor  symptom 
severity.

2.1 Data Collection: 

Selection  criteria  for  this  study  were  any  patients  who 
underwent  DBS  treatment  for  PD  at  the  University  of 
Washington  Medical  Center.    5  DBS  PD  patients  were 
enrolled in this study (3 male, 2 female). Patient demographics 
are displayed on Table 1. 4 of the patients underwent bilateral 
STN  targeted  DBS,  and  1  patient  underwent  bilateral  GPI 
targeted  DBS  (patient  5*).  Levodopa  Equivalency  Dosage 
(LED) was calculated per Tomlinson et al. [11], and is used to 
normalize patient dosages to a Levodopa equivalent. 

2.2 Motor Scores: 

Motor scores per the Movement Disorder Society Unified 
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS) [12] were 
collected for each patient for DBS in the ON and OFF states 
by  a  trained  movement  disorders  neurologist.    The  UPDRS

3. Results: 

3.1 GeMAPS Features: 

Table 2 displays our results for GeMAPS features. For α = 
0.05,  we  identified  6  significant  features.  Since  we  only 
collected  recordings  from  five  patients,  we  thought  that  our 
small dataset could hinder significant features. As such, Table 
2 also includes features that were below a cutoff threshold of 
p = 0.1, leading to 11 total features presented of the 88 total 
GeMAPS features. 

scores  and  the  different  prosodic  features.  Correlation 
coefficients  between  prosody  features  and  motor  scores  are 
displayed  on  Figure  2.  Many  prosody  features  significantly 
correlated  with  other  prosody  features.  This  confirmed  our 
assumption that many of the prosody features were related, i.e. 
pause  length  was  strongly  correlated  with  pause  percentage. 
Pause  percentage,  demonstrated  the  largest  correlation  with 
motor scores, with a correlation coefficient of -0.6. All other 
prosody features were also negatively correlated with motor 
symptom severity.

Brunet’s  index,  Honore’s  statistic,  and  the  type-token  ratio 
[16]. Differences between these features for DBS ON and OFF 
were insignificant.

3.2 Prosodic Features: 

Table 3: Linguistic Features Extracted  

No  statistically  significant  differences  were  found  for 
prosody  features,  thus  we  decided  to  look  at  the  correlation 
between  motor  symptom  severity  via  the  UPDRS  part  III 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Discussion: 

The purpose of our work was to explore and identify voice 
derived  digital  biomarkers,  which  could  potentially  help 
optimize the treatment of PD with DBS.  Our identification of 
significant  differences  amongst  GeMAPS  features  provides 
promising results that acoustic voice changes are present and 
quantifiable. PD has been known to affect many of the motor 
mechanisms of voice, thus these findings are consistent with 
PD affecting acoustic properties of voice.  

Although  none  of  the  prosody  features  were  statistically 
different  for  DBS  ON  vs  OFF,  negative  correlations  were 
present  between  prosodic  features  and  motor  symptom 
severity.  Combined  with  the  correlations  that  we  generated 
between prosodic features, this is a promising sign that there 
could  be  a  possible  correlation  to  be  further  explored. 
Decreased total electrical energy delivered via DBS has been 
associated  with  improvement  in  speech  prosody  per  [10]. 
Thus,  the  correlation  we  identified  is  consistent  with  prior 
findings,  as  prosodic  features  were  found  to  improve  with 
DBS OFF. 

Linguistic 

features  explored  also  demonstrated  no 
statistical  difference  for  DBS  ON  vs  OFF.  Although  the 
findings were insignificant, they provide results that could be 
further explored with an expanded data set. For the complex 
linguistic  features,  results  seemed  to  conflict.  DBS  ON 
corresponded  to  a  lower  Brunet  Index,  meaning  a  richer 
lexical  text  as  compared  to  the  DBS  OFF  group.  As  for  the 
Honore statistic, DBS ON was associated with a lower Honore 
Statistic, a less strong overall lexicon as compared to the DBS 
OFF group. These results demonstrate the differing linguistic 
features that could be associated with DBS ON or OFF, but 
further studies will need to be explored to demonstrate if the 
relationship is significant.  

4.1 Limitations: 

Our current study was limited by a few factors. The sample 
size of our study was only five individuals, with an age range 
of 34 years. This sample presents potential confounding due 
to  varying  age-related  co-morbidities.  Medication  dosages 
were not controlled for, and all patients had differing LED’s 
at  the  time  of  data  collection  which  could  contribute  to 
measured motor scores and voice characteristics. Lastly, the 
nature of individual variability on DBS settings for STN/GPI 
targeted DBS, would generate varying effects in each patient. 
The small sample size was not able to normalize any of these 
factors. 

5. Conclusion: 

This  study  provides  preliminary  evidence  for  voice 
biomarkers to act as an indicator for motor symptom severity 
amongst  PD  patients  with  DBS.  Acoustic  features  provided 
significant differences associated with DBS in ON and OFF 

states, as well as prosodic features demonstrating a correlation 
with motor symptom severity. With the increased accessibility 
of voice recording devices and voice technology, voice data 
has  potential  utility  in  monitoring  and  optimizing  DBS 
treatment without the need for patients to come into clinic. Our 
hope  is  to  be  able  to  gather  data  amongst  a  larger  subset  of 
DBS patients. This will allow us to utilize a data set where we 
can  strengthen  correspondence  between  motor  symptom 
severity  with  voice  features,  and  potentially  apply  towards 
voice operated closed-loop DBS.
