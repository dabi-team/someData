Abstract: 
Predictions of hydrologic variables across the entire water cycle have significant value for 
water resource management as well as downstream applications such as ecosystem and 
water quality modeling. Recently, purely data-driven deep learning models like long short-
term memory (LSTM) showed seemingly-insurmountable performance in modeling rainfall-
runoff and other geoscientific variables, yet they cannot predict unobserved physical 
variables and remain challenging to interpret. Here we show that differentiable, learnable, 
process-based models (called δ models here) can approach the performance level of LSTM 
for the intensively-observed variable (streamflow) with regionalized parameterization. We 
use a simple hydrologic model HBV as the backbone and use embedded neural networks, 
which can only be trained in a differentiable programming framework, to parameterize, 
replace, or enhance the process-based model modules. Without using an ensemble or post-
processor, δ models can obtain a median Nash Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.715 for 671 basins 
across the USA for a particular forcing data, compared to 0.72 from a state-of-the-art LSTM 
model with the same setup. Meanwhile, the resulting learnable process-based models can 
be evaluated (and later, to be trained) by multiple sources of observations, e.g., groundwater 
storage, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, and baseflow. Both simulated evapotranspiration 
and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with alternative estimates. The 
general framework can work with models with various process complexity and opens up the 
path for learning physics from big data. 

Plain language summary: 
Recently, deep neural networks like long short-term memory (LSTM) have received a lot of 
attention for producing high-accuracy simulations in hydrology, but they do not respect 
physical laws and remain difficult to understand. But what if you can have a model with 
almost the same accuracy, but with clarity about physical processes? And what if at the 
same time the model respects physical laws like mass conservation and produces 
interpretable outputs (like soil moisture, groundwater storage, and baseflow), with which you 
can tell a whole story to stakeholders? And what if the same framework allows you to ask 
precise questions about different parts of hydrology, which allows you to re-examine your 
understanding of some parts of the physical system or check if your past equations are 
correct? This paper delivers a system that achieves these grand goals and opens many 
avenues for further exploration.

1.  Introduction: 

Regional hydrologic models have been widely deployed for operational flood forecasting 

(Johnson et al., 2019; Maidment, 2017), future change projection (Hagemann et al., 2013), 

water resources management (Beck et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021; Mizukami et al., 2017), 

and supporting downstream applications such as crop (Ines et al., 2013) and water quality 

modeling (Dick et al., 2016; Strauch et al., 2017). The accuracy of these models has 

important implications for relevant government agencies and public stakeholders that place 

trust in them. The demand for accurate modeling capabilities will likely be on the rise due to 

increased risks of floods and droughts because of climate change (IPCC, 2021). 

Traditionally, regional hydrologic models describe not only streamflow but also other water 

stores in the hydrologic cycle (snow, surface ponding, soil moisture, groundwater), as well as 

fluxes (evapotranspiration, surface runoff, subsurface runoff, baseflow). The physical states 

(stores) and fluxes help to provide a full narrative of the event, e.g., high antecedent soil 

moisture or thawing snow primed the watershed for floods, which are important for 

communication with stakeholders. It allows us to ask specific scientific questions like 

identifying and characterizing types of floods (Berghuijs et al., 2016). Some process 

granularity (meaning the ability to describe the level of details that discern different 

processes) is also critically important for downstream applications. For example, agricultural 

models require knowledge of soil moisture and evapotranspiration demand, while water 

temperature models require a separation between surface runoff and baseflow. Through 

calibrating the models to streamflow, the hope was that the other fluxes and states would 

also be constrained via their physical linkages, but this is complicated due to parameter non-

uniqueness.

Recently, purely data-driven deep learning (DL) models (LeCun et al., 2015; Shen, 2018a, 

2018b) showed surprisingly strong performance in hydrologic modeling, but they do not 

resolve internal hydrologic dynamics. These models have very generic internal structures 

that allow them to learn directly from big data without invoking many problem-specific 

theories and assumptions. A particularly popular architecture in hydrology is long short-term 

memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTM’s accuracy has been 

demonstrated for many hydrologic variables on large datasets including soil moisture (Fang 

et al., 2017, 2019; Fang & Shen, 2020; Liu et al., 2022), streamflow (Konapala et al., 2020; 

Kratzert, Klotz, Shalev, et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2021; Xiang et al., 2020; Xiang & Demir, 

2020), dissolved oxygen (Zhi et al., 2021), evapotranspiration (Zhao et al., 2019), 

groundwater (Sahu et al., 2020; Solgi et al., 2021; Wunsch et al., 2021), and water 

temperature (Rahmani, Lawson, et al., 2021; Rahmani, Shen, et al., 2021), covering every 

part of the hydrologic cycle (Shen et al., 2021). It is widely publicized that LSTM represented 

a “step-change” in performance which also suggests our traditional models were far from 

optimality (Nearing et al., 2021). The growth from 2 LSTM papers in hydrology in 2017 to 

300+ papers in 2021 (Shen & Lawson, 2021) demonstrated its appeal and popularity.  

Nevertheless, many variables of interest are not adequately observed, so pure DL models 

do not apply to them. For hydrologic modeling, it remains challenging to interpret what is 

being learned by LSTM, in part because it does not output physical internal states and 

fluxes. While it is possible to correlate LSTM’s cell states to some physical states, there is no 

guarantee of the meaning of these states, and the physical connections between the states 

are unclear. It also does not allow us to freely ask questions about how the system functions. 

The hydrologic community appears to be at a crossroad: seemingly, they cannot have both 

predictive power and scientific understanding at the same time, yet both are crucial for 

projecting the impacts of our future climate.

For streamflow prediction, the current best performance with LSTM without using an 

ensemble and with forcing data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System 

(NLDAS; different forcing datasets have a moderate influence on results) shows a median 

Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.72, reported for the Catchment 

Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset (Addor et al., 2017; 

Newman et al., 2014) with 671 basins across the USA (Feng et al., 2020; Kratzert et al., 

2020). In a more interpretable modeling framework, Jiang et al. (2020) showed the possibility 

to connect a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a post-processor (or correction) layer to 

a conceptual process-based model encoded as a recurrent neural network. Their model 

achieved median NSE values of 0.48 and 0.71 without and with the CNN post-processor, 

respectively, for 591 basins (a subset of the 671 CAMELS basins). While this work is 

encouraging and is an important step forward, a workflow without the use of a post-

processing layer could potentially provide better physical significance and interpretability.  

In hydrologic modeling, there is a large distinction between locally-calibrated models and 

regionalized models (meaning parameters are related to autocorrelated, widely applicable 

features, not just calibrated on a gauge) (Hrachowitz et al., 2013). Only regionalized models 

are applicable to ungauged basins, though they will always have poorer performance than in 

gauged basins with site-by-site calibration, sometimes substantially (Beck et al., 2020; 

Hogue et al., 2005; Kumar et al., 2013; Rosero et al., 2010). LSTM can be regionalized 

when given basin-averaged attributes like soil composition or slope as inputs to distinguish 

between basins (in some studies, when the LSTM network is trained on a basin-by-basin 

basis, it essentially is a locally-calibrated model). LSTM is also not immune to performance 

degradation when applied to ungauged basins, but it has been shown to score higher than 

locally-calibrated hydrologic models even when tested out of sample (Feng et al., 2021; 

Kratzert, Klotz, Herrnegger, et al., 2019). In fact, regionalized LSTM remained competitive 

even in the scenario of being applied in large, contiguous regions with no data if some 

4 

 
 
 
ensemble methods were used (Feng et al., 2021). While locally-calibrated models are 

certainly useful, in this work we focus on regionalized frameworks for wider applicability in 

the future. 

Our earlier work showed that a framework called differentiable parameter learning (dPL) 

could employ big data and machine learning approaches to find parameter sets for process-

based geoscientific models (Tsai et al., 2021). dPL provided similar performance compared 

to evolutionary algorithms for the main calibration variable, and presented better results for 

spatial generalization and uncalibrated variables, while also using orders-of-magnitude lower 

computational effort. dPL superseded earlier regionalization schemes in PUB tests. Such 

strengths are partly because dPL leverages a beneficial data scaling curve where the 

inclusion of many sites allows them to benefit each other. dPL is named as such because it 

applies differentiable programming (Baydin et al., 2018), which enables us to track the 

gradients of the outputs of process-based models with respect to input parameters or neural 

network weights, for the models’ parameterization. Differentiability critically enables the 

training of large-scale neural networks to work with process-based models. While dPL gives 

an initial glimpse at the power of applying differentiable programming to hydrology, it alone 

does not penetrate model process descriptions, and thus the performance is still limited by 

the structure of the existing models. In terms of accuracy, dPL can find close-to-optimal 

parameters for process-based models, but the end outcomes still lag far behind pure DL 

models.  

Expanding from the advances of dPL, here we demonstrate a new hydrologic modeling 

paradigm where learnable, differentiable process-based models with embedded neural 

networks (NN) can achieve similar predictive performance as LSTM models. We call them δ 

models because they fully leverage differentiable programming so the models are 

“learnable” and “evolvable”. Further, such a learnable model respects mass balances, can 

5 

 
 
 
 
output important internal physical fluxes, and allows us to ask new scientific questions. We 

imposed several additional requirements on our framework: (i) each step of the main model 

calculation either has physical logic associated with physical terms, or uses a neural network 

but with its effects quantified, (ii) mass balances are observed, and (iii) multiple internal 

fluxes and states are described (e.g., groundwater and surface water contributions should be 

distinguished in our test case). This paper is intended to be a concise report on the potential 

performance, methodology, and implications, with myriad research questions set in motion 

for the future.  

2.  Methods and datasets 

Some parts of this section are removed from the journal submission version while it 

goes through the initial phase of peer review. 

As an overview, we use an existing process-based model as a backbone, which can be 

based on either discrete (modifying from a backbone with discrete formulation) or continuous 

(written in a differential equation format) formulations. Only the discrete version is 

demonstrated in this paper. In this example, we selected the Hydrologiska Byråns 

Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model (Aghakouchak & Habib, 2010; Beck et al., 2020; 

Bergström, 1976, 1992; Seibert & Vis, 2012) as the backbone. HBV is a simple bucket-type 

hydrologic model that simulates hydrologic variables including snow water equivalent, soil 

water, groundwater storage, evapotranspiration, quick flow, baseflow, and total streamflow. 

We then altered parts of the backbone model structure, coupled it with differentiable 

parameter learning (dPL) as a regionalized parameterization scheme, and replaced parts of 

the model with neural networks. We then trained and tested the model on the CAMELS 

dataset.  

2.1. dPL and dPL+HBV for comparison 

6 

 
 
 
 
Differentiable parameter learning (dPL) only concerns the parameter space and is used to 

support parameterization of the evolved HBV model, as well as to serve as a comparison 

case when coupled with the unmodified HBV model. The dPL framework can be described 

concisely as θ = gA(A,x) where θ represents some parameters, A contains some static 

attributes such as topography, soil texture, land cover, and geology, x is the meteorological 

forcings (Section 2.4.1), and gA is the parameter estimation neural network. We tried treating 

parts of θ as either static or dynamic. If a parameter is treated as static, the same value is 

used throughout the HBV simulation. If it is treated as dynamic, the model gets a new value 

for this parameter every day, which we call dynamical parameterization (DP), denoted by 

superscript t. The original HBV model only has time-constant parameters so we made a 

change to reflect the impacts of vegetation, seasonal water storage, and to correct errors 

with the ET formula (Section 2.2). To support dynamic parameterization, the network gA is in 

fact an LSTM model. A main feature of the dPL framework is that 𝜃 is subsequently provided 

to the HBV model and gA is trained together with the rest of the model by the global loss 

function involving all sites. In machine learning language, this framework is called “end-to-

end”, in that there are no intermediate ground-truth data as supervising data for 𝜃. This 

avoids two issues: first is that we do not normally have ground-truth data for 𝜃 (while some 

soil parameters may be occasionally available, most other parameters like groundwater 

recession parameters or runoff factors are not); second is that we minimize the chance for 

error with the intermediate steps.  

2.2. The differentiable, learnable process-based model 

The time-discrete HBV model is described succinctly in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. 

This model has five state variables. We implemented the time-discrete HBV model on 

PyTorch, a platform supporting automatic differentiation (Paszke et al., 2017). Other 

platforms could work similarly.

Here are some of the explanations and rationales for the modifications: 

A.  We added a parameter to the ET equation (γ in Table 1’s “Equations modified” 

column for surface soil). 

B.  We tested allowing γ to be dynamic (γt) to mitigate the errors from the potential ET 

equation and to mimic the impacts of vegetation. For the latter, the impacts would be 

season-dependent due to the phenological cycle of vegetation, e.g., in the summer, 

the vegetation roots will be more active; after drought, vegetation may need time to 

recover its water use efficiency. Because a model like LSTM can automatically 

capture such effects while the original HBV cannot, HBV may never reach the 

performance of LSTM without considering seasonally-varying parameters. We also 

tested setting the runoff curve parameter (β) to be dynamical (βt) as a comparison 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
scenario to understand the influence of these choices. This parameter characterizes 

the relationship between surface soil moisture and effective rainfall (the amount of 

water available for runoff). The curve roughly characterizes how soil wetness 

translates into effective rainfall, and β is inversely related to runoff. Having a 

dynamical βt can allow the forcing history to influence runoff production. 

C.  We tested replacing the effective rainfall parts of the model with a neural network to 

examine if there are more suitable relationships to describe the moisture-runoff 

relationship than the original one. The NN replacement method can be similarly 

applied to other modules like groundwater and ET, but here we only applied it to the 

effective rainfall component to constrain the model’s flexibility. Other replacements 

can be investigated in future work. 

D.  As in Tsai et al. (2021) and Mizukami et al. (2017), we added a routing module to the 

hydrologic model with two parameters (Table 1). This module assumes a gamma 

function for the unit hydrograph and convolves the unit hydrograph with the runoff to 

produce the final streamflow output, which is compared to the observed streamflow. 

This routing module is employed in all of our HBV-based simulations in this paper. 

We use the symbology δ to represent different dPL+ evolved HBV models for easy 

reference. δ(βt) represents using both the evolved HBV and dynamic parameter β. We could 

use δHBV to indicate that HBV is the backbone, and many other backbones can be used, but 

since all of the models in this paper used HBV as the backbone, we omitted the superscript 

and simply used δ instead.  

2.3.3 Model training, hyperparameters, and other details 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
We trained the models on 15 years’ worth of data from 1 October 1980 to 30 September 

1995 and evaluated the performance on another 15 years’ worth of data from 1 October 

1995 to 30 September 2010. The 5 years’ worth of data from 1 October 1980 to 30 

September 1985 was used to select the hyperparameters. For the hyperparameters of the 

LSTM model used as gA in dPL+HBV (Figure 1), we manually tested several combinations 

and chose 256 hidden states. A mini-batch size of 100 and a training length of 365 days 

were used to train the dPL+HBV framework. Additionally, we used one year of 

meteorological forcings as the warm-up period for initializing the state variables of HBV 

during training. Except for the dPL models, we also ran the purely data-driven LSTM 

streamflow model on the same time periods for performance comparison. The setup of the 

LSTM streamflow model was the same as in our previous study (Feng et al., 2020). 

Additionally, to be comparable with previous regionalized modeling studies (Rakovec et al., 

2019), we also run some dPL experiments on the same training/testing periods as theirs.   

2.3.4 Loss function and evaluation metrics. 

Our loss function (Equation 1) was defined as a weighted combination of two parts based on 

root-mean-square error (RMSE) calculations on all basins (in practice, a minibatch of basins 

during training). The first part was the RMSE calculated on the predicted and observed 

streamflow, while the second part was the RMSE calculated on the transformed streamflow 

(Equation 2). The transformation in the second part of the loss aims at improving low flow 

representation. We used a parameter 𝛼 to assign weights to different parts of the loss 

function and the value 0.25 was used here to train all the HBV models. For the benchmark 

LSTM model, we applied the transformation (Equation 2) and normalization as 

preprocessing steps, which were found to give slightly better NSEs in our previous study 

(Feng et al., 2020). The loss function of LSTM was the RMSE of the normalized data.

Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients (NSE). NSE is one minus the ratio of the error 

variance of the modeled time series divided by the variance of the observed time series. It is 

1 for a perfect model and 0 for the long-term mean value used as the prediction.  

2.4. Input and observation datasets 

2.4.1. Forcing, streamflow, and attribute data 

We used the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) 

dataset (Addor et al., 2017; Newman et al., 2014) which contains meteorological forcings, 

streamflow observations, and attributes for 671 basins in the conterminous United States 

(CONUS). The North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) (Xia et al., 2012) 

meteorological forcings from CAMELS were used to run the experiments, with the daily 

minimum and maximum NLDAS temperature data obtained from Kratzert (2019). The HBV 

model only used three forcing variables: precipitation (P), temperature (T), and potential 

evapotranspiration (Ep). Describing the total evaporative demand, Ep was estimated using 

the Hargreaves (1994) method, which considers mean, maximum, minimum temperatures 

and latitudes. For gA, x={P, T, Ep} was used as the dynamical forcings. For the comparison 

LSTM model, we used {P, T, solar radiation, vapor pressure, day lengths} as forcings. The 

inputs to HBV is pre-determined by its structure while it can be any relevant variable for 

LSTM. 

We used the streamflow data compiled by the CAMELS dataset, which was, in turn, 

obtained from the streamflow network of the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Static 

12 

 
 
 
 
attribute data from CAMELS including 35 topography, climate, land cover, soil, and geology 

variables in total (Table A1 in the Appendix) were included as inputs to dPL to train 

regionalized models. We also acquired the simulations of other regionalized models from 

previous studies as comparisons for our dPL models (Kratzert, Klotz, Shalev, et al., 2019; 

Rakovec et al., 2019). 

2.4.2. Baseflow index and evapotranspiration for evaluation 

The baseflow index (BFIL13) was derived from applying Lyne and Hollick filters with warmup 

periods to streamflow hydrographs by Ladson et al, (2013), which was compiled and 

included in CAMELS. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), part of the 

National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Observing System (NASA/EOS) 

project, uses satellite data to estimate terrestrial surface evapotranspiration. The improved 

ET algorithm of the MOD16-MT dataset is based on the Penman-Monteith equation 

(Monteith, 1965; Mu et al., 2011). The input data includes meteorological reanalysis data of 

daily surface downward solar radiation and air temperature, and MODIS products such as 

albedo, land cover, leaf area index, and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation. The 

data cover all basins in CAMELS. We composited the outputs from our models as 8-day 

data following the same composite methodology as MODIS, and compared them. 

3. Results and Discussion 

We first briefly showcase the surprising performance of the evolved differentiable HBV 

models and put them in the context of previous literature. Then, we compare simulated 

internal variables to other estimates.  

3.1. Streamflow metrics. 

On the CAMELS dataset, strikingly, some of the δ models achieved comparable Nash-

Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient values (NSE=0.715) to LSTM (NSE=0.72 with NLDAS 

without ensemble -- this result is the same with either our LSTM or that of Kratzert et al.,

(2020) (Figure 2 and Table 2). They are both clearly ahead of dPL+HBV (representing the 

unmodified model with optimized, regionalized parameters, median NSE=0.628), and 

MPR+mHm (representing another traditional model with a different regionalization scheme, 

median NSE=0.53).  

These strengths in metrics have strong real-world implications as shown by time series 

comparisons for several example basins (Figure 3). The HBV model had difficulties 

capturing flood peaks for basin A in east Texas, while the evolved structure can mitigate this 

problem (Figure 3a). For basin B, close to the Great Lake, the evolved model corrected the 

timing error of the peak flows from the original HBV model (Figure 3b). We can clearly see 

an improved flow dynamics from basin C located in the Rocky mountains. The evolved 

model improved both the peak and baseflow estimation here (Figure 3c).  

The fact that we can approach LSTM performance using a process-based, mass-

conservative model is refreshing because in previous studies, the gap between LSTM and 

process-based models with a wide variety of structures appeared to be uncrossable. These 

results indicated that it is difficult for expert-derived formulas to match the ability of trained 

neural networks, a pattern we have seen repeatedly in recent studies across various 

disciplines. In this work, however, we observe that the gaps in performance between LSTM 

and learnable models (δ models) are not so large. This highlights the power of having 

learnable structures and adaptivity in the model. 

Considering the nuances of the configurations and comparing it laterally with the literature, 

the performance of optimization in our differentiable framework (median NSE=0.715) should 

be close to optimum. Firstly, we have not employed a neural network as a post-processor. 

Previous results showed that using an LSTM as a post-processor to a hydrologic model 

produces the same results as LSTM itself (Frame et al., 2021). In this case, post-processors 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
can strongly alter the simulation so that the contributions from the front-end model are no 

longer clear. Secondly, we have not employed an ensemble, which could elevate median 

NSE from 0.72 to 0.74 with NLDAS forcing (Feng et al., 2020; Kratzert, Klotz, Herrnegger, et 

al., 2019) and could also help traditional models (Seibert et al., 2018), and will be explored in 

the next stage. Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, previous results with traditional hydrologic 

models almost always showed regionalized parameterization to be weaker than site-by-site 

calibration --- previous best results with regionalized hydrologic models had a median of 0.53 

(Beck et al., 2020; Rakovec et al., 2019). However, the result of our regionalized formulation 

is even close to the recording-holding LSTM models. Presumably, like LSTM, it also benefits 

from the efficiency and data synergy of learning from big data (Fang et al., 2022).  

The models that do not utilize dynamical parameterization (DP) already presented 

substantial improvements over traditional models, but to truly approach the performance of 

LSTM, we needed to invoke DP. The δ model (without DP) was at median NSE values of 

0.694 (Table 2), already significantly higher than regionalized HBV (NSE=0.628) or mHm 

(NSE=0.53). This shows that DP is not necessarily needed for the model to be operational. 

However, we should not let go of trying to further close the gap to LSTM (from 0.697 to 0.72) 

because it is symptomatic of some more fundamental issues. After various attempts, we 

were never able to get a median NSE above 0.705 without DP.  

The estimated dynamical runoff factor βt, which is negatively related to runoff, has a main 

seasonal cycle with spikes corresponding to storms (Figure 4, obtained from the δ(βt) 

model). βt starts at the highest level in October, reaches bottom in March or April, and starts 

to rise in May or June. It corresponds to increasing runoff (other conditions being equal) from 

October to March, and reducing runoff from May to September, which matches the rhythm of 

the seasonal water storage cycle. In the original HBV, only the surface layers (Ss & Suz) 

influence runoff, and the deeper groundwater reservoirs have no feedback to surface runoff, 

15 

 
 
 
 
i.e., quick flow generation is not influenced by how much water there is in deeper 

groundwater layers in the model. In reality, this feedback can be important as large water 

storage in the basin can prime the basin for large runoffs. Hence, an explanation is that the 

dynamical parameterization captured this problem and introduced a mechanism for high 

water storage accumulated over months to increase runoff. This is consistent with the 

observations that βt in the hot Texas basins (Figures 3a & 4a) has more flashy and less 

seasonal response -- runoff in these basins tend to be flash infiltration excess and the effect 

of water storage is limited. Another concurrent possibility is βt also reflects more established 

canopy in warm seasons to increase abstraction and reduce runoff. 

Regarding why it is useful to enable dynamical parameterization for γt, which is related to 

ET, we hypothesize that two factors are at play: (i) the potential ET formula (Hargreaves) 

could not adequately capture the ET demand but DP (with γt) could correct it; and (ii) there 

are some missing memory mechanisms (or states) in the design of the HBV model, in terms 

of representing seasonally-varying ecosystem states like vegetation density, leaf area index, 

rooting depth, and xylem states (Mackay et al., 2015). These states reflect the impacts of 

accumulated forcings at the monthly scale. Models like LSTM could implicitly capture such 

seasonal effects. In contrast, the original HBV model, as well as many other conceptual 

models, simply does not have a functional vegetation module.  

For γt and βt, their states in DP reflects the impacts of accumulated forcings at the monthly 

scale. Models like LSTM could implicitly capture such seasonal effects. In contrast, the 

original HBV, as well as many conceptual models, simply does not have these processes 

and memory. Other parameters must be distorted for the original model to compensate for 

their absence. If our theory is true, we expect that no process-based models, learnable or 

not, can achieve optimal performance without adding these states.

3.2. Comparisons of the baseflow index and ET 

As opposed to the LSTM model which can only predict the total streamflow, the evolved 

HBV (δ) models can elucidate the different sources of streamflow and ET. Overall, we found 

that the baseflow and ET metrics tended to be consistent with NSE, that is, models with 

better NSE also tended to have better correlations of baseflow and ET (Table 2), although 

exceptions did exist. The δ(γt, βt) model which has the highest median NSE also has the 

highest baseflow correlation with BFIL13 and median ET correlation with MODIS.  

There is a decent correlation (R=0.745 for δ(γt, βt) and 0.729 for δ) between the simulated 

BFI (Q2/Q) and BFI derived from Ladson et al (2013), BFIL13 (Figure 5f), showing the 

subsurface module in evolved HBV has captured the rough baseflow patterns across the 

CONUS (Figure 5b,d). It should be noted that the results of baseflow recession analysis can 

vary significantly based on the procedure and assumptions employed and do not represent 

ground truth. Hence, we place more emphasis on the general spatial pattern rather than the 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
absolute values in the BFI. We notice high BFI associated with thick and permeable soil in 

the southeast and western US, and in the Upper Colorado river basin. We also notice low 

BFI along the Appalachian Plateau extending into the Central Plains, in line with previous 

analysis of terrestrial water storage data and streamflow (Fang & Shen, 2017). Overall, the 

HBV-predicted BFI (Q2/Q) trends towards being higher than BFIL13. Q2/Q from basins with 

NSE values over 0.5 has a higher correlation with BFIL13 than for the whole dataset. On a 

side note, the basins with NSE<0.5 (the basins in Figure 5a but missing in Figure 5b) 

concentrate on the upper Great Plains, which has been known for a long time to cause 

difficulties for various kinds of models (Feng et al., 2020; Newman et al., 2015). We suspect 

this is due to incorrect watershed boundaries, highly-concentrated rainfall, and the existence 

of cross-basin water transfer, i.e., large-scale groundwater flow and springs.  

It is not surprising that the simulated Q2/Q agrees with the values derived from baseflow 

separation analysis, which is based on streamflow hydrographs. Passing water through the 

system and releasing it as Q2 is the primary way for the model to mathematically introduce 

slowly-varying base flows. However, the point is that we can now diagnose different parts of 

streamflow contributions by learning from data, and further link them to downstream 

applications such as water temperature predictions. 

For the original HBV, δ, and δ(γt, βt) models, the median temporal correlation of ET was 

0.79, 0.79, and 0.85 (Table 2) and the median RMSE was 7.12, 6.77, and 6.21 mm/8days, 

respectively, against the 8-day integrated MOD16-MT ET product on CAMELS basins(Figure 

6a). Correlation with MOD16-MT improved from the original HBV to δ(γt, βt), which is 

consistent with the improvement of streamflow NSE (Figure 6a, Table 2). These ET metrics 

are decent and appear better than the accuracy levels reported for other estimates 

evaluated against MOD16-MT. To give some context, when evaluated on a monthly scale, 

Velpuri et al. (2013) reported R2 of ~0.56 and an RMSE between 26-32 mm/month between 

18 

 
 
 
 
MOD16-MT and FLUXNET stations. Even without training on ET, the differentiable process-

based models can predict reasonable daily ET, which LSTM cannot do at all.  

We also note that the model with dynamic parameterization has a higher median correlation 

with MOD16-MT. The ET correlation of δ(γt) is better than δ(βt), and δ(γt, βt) is better than 

both of them. This suggests the system calls for memory mechanisms associated with ET. 

All of these observations suggest ET can be better aided by using dynamic parameterization 

for γ, which further suggests there are flaws with the present ET algorithm in the model, 

either due to imperfect potential ET estimation or lack of vegetation. 

It is difficult to provide a lateral comparison based on daily ET data to the literature regarding 

the value of learning from streamflow. There is a lack of evaluation of ET on the CAMELS 

basins in the literature, while the FLUXNET data, which were often used to evaluate ET 

products, were not coincident with the CAMELS basins to examine the effects of learning 

from streamflow data. MOD16-MT, estimated using a modified Penman-Monteith equation 

(Mu et al., 2011), should not be interpreted as ground truth. The point here is not that this 

model produces more accurate ET (which will be studied in future work), but that the 

differentiable process-based model can now be constrained and evaluated by multi-source, 

multifaceted observations.

3.3. Further discussion 

In this work we limited ourselves to frameworks that support prediction in ungauged basins, 

even though we leave the rigorous PUB benchmark to future work. Our parameterization 

and learning schemes are regionalized and based on widely-available inputs, and are thus 

applicable to large scales. Due to the lack of physical laws, LSTM may not learn the true 

causal relationship between static inputs and outputs. Therefore, we hypothesize the decline 

in performance from training basins to ungauged basins will be less significant for our 

learnable physical model than LSTM. Our future work will rigorously evaluate this 

hypothesis. 

It is an expert's choice which model we use as a backbone and how much model structure 

we retain, but that choice impacts what kind of question can be asked. Here we chose a 

backbone that discerns soil moisture, groundwater, quickflow, and baseflow so we can 

support downstream applications like stream temperature and ecosystem modeling. On the 

24 

 
 
 
 
 
flip side, one could use a much more complex model as a backbone, but generally, adding 

too many structural constraints tends to degrade model accuracy. In the end, we may have 

to make a conscious choice between interpretability and accuracy. We recommend 

backbone models with a process granularity that enables providing a narrative to 

stakeholders.  

Having process granularity and physical fluxes and variables gives us another advantage --- 

we can now use multiple observations to constrain the model or inform unobserved 

variables. For example, since soil moisture observations are more widely available from 

satellite missions, we could use these observations, apart from streamflow, to constrain the 

model and update model states using the DL equivalent of data assimilation. Including 

additional observations to constrain different parts of the hydrologic model could reduce 

uncertainty and make the model more robust (Dembélé et al., 2020; Efstratiadis & 

Koutsoyiannis, 2010). This would not be possible for an alternative model whose backbone 

does not include soil moisture as an output.  

Here the NNs are embedded into a time-discrete model which explicitly integrates over the 

time steps. Strictly speaking, the NNs in this framework learn the time-integrated operator 

which varies based on the time step size. This could be interpreted as using a forward Euler 

scheme to integrate over time. It is also possible to place the NN on the differential equation 

and use more accurate numerical solvers for time integration (Rackauckas et al., 2021), 

which would force the NN to learn the continuous operator. Both approaches are valid. The 

discrete version would require little change to the existing models (the code could be 

translated verbatim) which already have well-understood numerical schemes. The 

differential equation version would need stable integrator schemes in place, but it would also 

be a valuable avenue to explore. 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
While we showed the necessity of employing dynamical parameterization (DP) to truly stay 

on par with LSTM, we caution against an overuse of DP in the model. For one, many 

parameters, such as groundwater recession parameters, should not be dynamic. For two, 

because LSTM is so powerful, if we apply DP throughout the system, it has a high chance of 

achieving high performance, but we may start to lose physical significance and the system 

may revert to being an LSTM variant. The effects of DP should be quantified, its role justified 

by physical mechanisms, and its importance should be limited. In our case, DP only had a 

minor impact (median NSE 0.697 to 0.715). In other words, the variance to be explained by 

DP should not overwhelm the physical part. For future differentiable modeling methods, one 

important research direction would be system ways to limit or constrain the roles of neural 

networks and retain physical significance while allowing the framework to adapt to data. 

We think the groundwater component still has significant room for improvement because the 

current groundwater formulations are too simple. Future efforts should pay special attention 

to improving the groundwater component, even though groundwater improvement does not 

necessarily get reflected in the NSE values. 

4. Conclusion 

The strong performance of the evolved HBV model shows that generalist model architecture 

like LSTM is not entirely necessary to achieve high performance. The success of this 

framework means we can now use differentiable programming to ask mechanistic questions. 

The above statements are not to say pure DL models are not useful -- they remain highly 

valuable because they can be quickly set up to gauge the information content in datasets, 

and they can provide a wealth of diagnostic signals. 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
We have imposed upon ourselves some stringent conditions (mass conservation, physical 

calculations, and interpretable physical outputs). The unchanged parts of the numerical 

model serve as physical constraints, allowing our model to output physical states and fluxes 

that are valuable for downstream applications. Utilizing a backbone with a sufficient level of 

process granularity is important to help with this mission. 

The strengths of the differentiable models and LSTM models over traditional hydrologic 

models highlight the power of adaptive learning capacity. There seems to be a chasm 

between the performance of models with or without learnable components, but the gaps are 

minor between those alternatives that do have them. However, to enable learning complex 

functions, differentiable programming will be required because traditional optimization 

capabilities can barely handle more than 20 parameters. Numerically approximating the 

derivatives is prohibitively expensive for large neural networks. Thus, we perceive 

differentiable programming as an inevitable and promising path toward substantial growth. 

Since the evolved HBV model has better results than dPL+HBV, it is now easier (compared 

to using LSTM) to answer the questions, e.g., What should have been the equation if the 

original one was not good enough? We only conducted some preliminary studies in this 

work, but hopefully it should be obvious that this flexibility allows us to open a whole new line 

of research. There are exciting opportunities to leverage this framework for asking novel 

questions or addressing some of hydrologists’ nemesis questions in the near future.
