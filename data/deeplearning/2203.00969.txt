Abstract
This paper presents a thousand passive spiral galaxy samples at z = 0.01–0.3 based on
a combined analysis of the Third Public Data Release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program (HSC-SSP PDR3) and the GALEX–SDSS–WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC-
2). Among 54871 gri galaxy cutouts taken from the HSC-SSP PDR3 over 1072 deg2, we con-
ducted a search with deep-learning morphological classiﬁcation for candidates of passive spi-
rals below the star-forming main sequence derived by UV to mid-IR SED ﬁtting in the GSWLC-
2. We then classiﬁed the candidates into 1100 passive spirals and 1141 secondary samples
based on visual inspections. Most of the latter cases are considered to be passive ringed S0
or pseudo-ringed galaxies. The remainder of these secondary samples has ambiguous mor-
phologies, including two peculiar objects with diamond-shaped stellar wings. The selected pas-
sive spirals have a similar distribution to the general quiescent galaxies on the EWHδ–Dn4000
diagram and concentration indices. Moreover, we detected an enhanced passive fraction of
spiral galaxies in X-ray clusters. Passive spirals in galaxy clusters are preferentially located
in the midterm or late infall phase on the phase-space diagram, supporting the ram pressure
scenario, which has been widely advocated in previous studies.
The source catalog and gri-composite images are available on the HSC-SSP PDR3 web-
site (https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/data-release/). Future updates, including integra-
tion with a citizen science project dedicated to the HSC data, will achieve more effective and
comprehensive classiﬁcations.

1 Introduction

To understand the fate of spiral galaxies, including our
own Galaxy, passive spiral galaxies (termed ‘anemic’ spi-
rals; van den Bergh 1976) yield important insights into
their transition processes from the star-forming to the qui-
escent phase. They would also uniquely give a hint at the
formation and destruction mechanisms of spiral structures
(see theoretical studies, e.g. Lin & Shu 1964; Goldreich &
Lynden-Bell 1965; Sellwood & Carlberg 1984; Bertin et al.
1989; D’Onghia et al. 2013; Dobbs & Baba 2014).

From a historical perspective, since the discovery of the
signiﬁcant presence of passive spirals in rich clusters (van
den Bergh 1976), the physical origins of passive spirals have
been widely linked to environmental phenomena (Goto
et al. 2003; Yamauchi & Goto 2004; Koopmann & Kenney
2004; Boselli et al. 2006; Moran et al. 2007; Blanton &
Moustakas 2009; Masters et al. 2010). Additionally, cold
gas observations have reported that passive spiral galaxies
are Hi-deﬁcient but not in molecules compared to normal
star-forming spirals, suggesting a lack of persist gas supply
owing to truncation of the outer Hi disk, which may origi-
nate from environmental eﬀects in some cases (e.g. Bothun
& Sullivan 1980; Giovanelli & Haynes 1983; Cayatte et al.
1994; Bravo-Alfaro et al. 2001; Elmegreen et al. 2002).
Ram pressure stripping in clusters or falling subclus-
ters (referred to as pre-processing) can lead to strangu-
lation and slow star formation quenching (Gunn & Gott
1972; Fujita 2004; Kawata & Mulchaey 2008; Hamabata
et al. 2019; Rhee et al. 2020).

However, a consensus has yet to be reached on these
matters, as their abundance is overwhelmingly small (e.g.,
∼ 6% in Masters et al. 2010, and see also references
therein). The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York
et al. 2000) has played a key role in sample collection
over the last two decades. In addition, UV and IR pho-
tometric data, such as the Galaxy Evolution Explorer
(GALEX; Martin et al. 2005) and the Wide-ﬁeld Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) are crucial
to make a reliable selection (Fraser-McKelvie et al. 2016).
Conversely, much deeper and sharper images with larger
aperture telescopes are highly desired to conduct an in-
depth passive spiral search, which can cover faint spiral
structures missing in previous surveys and also resolve
pseudo-rings with smaller pitch angles of spiral arms. Such
objects with less-prominent spiral features provide a less
biased insight into the late evolutionary stage of spiral
galaxies.

The Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program
(HSC-SSP; Aihara et al. 2018; Miyazaki et al. 2018;

† NAOJ Fellow

Furusawa et al. 2018; Kawanomoto et al. 2018; Komiyama
et al. 2018) on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope satisﬁes these
stringent requirements. The HSC-SSP surveys 1400 deg2
areas in grizy broadbands approximately 3 mag deeper
and with ∼ 2 times better seeing size compared to the
SDSS. With such high-quality data, we can expect to cap-
ture fainter spiral arms not detected in previous surveys
and those with smaller pitch angles mistaken for ringed
galaxies. Many studies have demonstrated the utility of
the HSC-SSP data, such as galaxy morphological classiﬁ-
cations (Tadaki et al. 2020; Martin et al. 2020; Shimakawa
et al. 2021), weak lensing measurements (Oguri et al.
2018; Oguri et al. 2021), and anomaly detection (Storey-
Fisher et al. 2021; Tanaka et al. 2021). Therefore, the
HSC-SSP data will enable us to signiﬁcantly expand upon
existing passive spiral samples, oﬀering a unique opportu-
nity to understand the transition phase from spiral galaxies
to early-type galaxies statistically.

With this motivation, this study aims to establish a
large sample of passive spiral galaxies by using the HSC-
SSP PDR3 (Aihara et al. 2021). The remainder of this
paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst overview our
dataset and deep learning-based methodology to select spi-
ral galaxies at z = 0.01−0.3 (section 2). Subsequently, we
choose passive spiral galaxies based on the GALEX–SDSS–
WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC-2; Salim et al. 2018) and
describe our passive spiral catalog (Section 3). In section 4,
we compare the spectral properties of the passive spirals
with those of the entire sample, and investigate their dy-
namic associations with massive galaxy clusters for the
cluster members. Finally, we summarize our results and
prospects (section 5). Following the GSWLC-2 catalog
used in this study (Salim et al. 2018), the AB magnitude
system (Oke & Gunn 1983) and a Chabrier (2003) stellar
initial mass function (IMF) are adopted. Moreover, we as-
sume a ﬂat WMAP7 cosmology (H0 = 70 km s−1Mpc−1,
Ωm = 0.27; Komatsu et al. 2011).

2 Data and methodology

In the subsections that follow, we introduce the salient
features of the HSC-SSP and the selection of 54871 main
targets at z = 0.01–0.3 (section 2.1). Subsequently, we de-
scribe the color-image construction (section 2.2), and the
calibration of our deep learning classiﬁer of spiral mor-
phologies (section 2.3).

2.1 Sample selection

The HSC-SSP PDR3 provides a science-ready catalog and
coadd imaging data, which were taken through 278 nights

and reduced by the dedicated pipeline (hscPipe version
8; Bosch et al. 2018). The survey ﬁeld is split on the
database into areas of approximately 1.7×1.7 deg2, termed
tracts, and further divided into approximately 12 × 12
arcmin2 regions called patches (Aihara et al. 2021). To ex-
clude poor seeing data, we employ only patch regions with
seeing FWHM (full-width-half-maximum) smaller than 1.0
arcsec in all gri bands, which amounts to the total survey
area of 1072 deg2.

As a starting point, we use 63504 bright galaxies at z =
0.01–0.3 in the HSC-SSP PDR3 Wide layer1 (Aihara et al.
2021), all of which have spec-z counterparts in the SDSS
DR15 (Blanton et al. 2017; Aguado et al. 2019; Bolton
et al. 2012) and the GALEX–SDSS–WISE Legacy Catalog
(GSWLC-2; Salim et al. 2016; Salim et al. 2018). The tar-
gets are mostly based on the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample
(rpetro < 17.77; Strauss et al. 2002) as they select bright
SDSS sources above the Petrosian (1976) magnitude limit,
rpetro < 18. The GSWLC-2 has derived their physical prop-
erties, including stellar masses and star formation rates
(SFRs) with UV to mid-IR spectral energy distribution
(SED) ﬁtting using CIGALE (Noll et al. 2009) with stellar
population synthesis models in Bruzual & Charlot (2003),
based on GALEX GR6/7 (Martin et al. 2005), SDSS DR7
(Abazajian et al. 2009), and 22 µm data from ALLWISE
source catalog (Lang et al. 2016). Based on these datasets,
the GSWLC-2 provided three separate catalogs depending
on the depth of the UV survey (all-sky, A; medium, M;
and deep, D). The GSWLC-A catalog is employed in this
study to homogeneously select passive spirals across the
survey ﬁeld, unless otherwise noted.

All 63504 sources are detected in the grizy broadband
data of the HSC-SSP PDR3 and are not inﬂuenced by
nearby bright stars (G < 18 mag; Aihara et al. 2021), cos-
mic rays, or bad pixels, by applying the following criteria
in the SQL query:
forced.isprimary=True,
inputcount flag noinputs=False,
sdssshape flag badcentroid=False,
pixelflags edge=False,
pixelflags crcenter=False,
pixelflags bad=False,
psfflux flag=False,
mask brightstar halo=False,
mask brightstar ghost=False,
mask brightstar blooming=False.
For details on these catalog ﬂags, refer to Coupon et al.
(2018); Aihara et al. (2021); Bosch et al. (2018). In addi-
tion, point sources are removed based on the threshold of
i psfflux mag−i cmodel mag>0.2 (see also Strauss et al.

1 https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/data-release/

2002; Baldry et al. 2010). Consequently, we are left with
54871 galaxies at z = 0.01–0.3 over 1072 deg2.

2.2 Image construction

For the selected targets, we constructed RGB color cutouts
in the png format with a size of (4 × R90)2 arcsec2, where
R90 is a radius within which 90% of the Petrosian aperture
ﬂux in the r-band is included. We adopted the R90 values
of our targets from the SDSS DR15 (petroR90; Aguado
et al. 2019) by cross-matching between our sample and
the SDSS sources within a radius of 1 arcsec. Flux scal-
ing generally follows our previous work (Shimakawa et al.
2021), which adopts an inverse hyperbolic sine function,
arcsinh (Lupton et al. 1999; Lupton et al. 2004). The arc-
sinh normalization has been widely employed in previous
studies related to galaxy morphology classiﬁcation, such as
the Galaxy Zoo project (Lintott et al. 2008; Lintott et al.
2011; Willett et al. 2013). Because the arcsinh stretch has
also been used in the citizen astronomy program based on
the HSC imaging data (GALAXY CRUISE2), we can integrate
this analysis with a large training dataset provided by this
citizen science program in the near future.

After homogenizing the seeing FWHM of the images to
1.0 arcsec by the Gaussian smoothing, we perform the arc-
sinh normalization with a code provided by the HSC-SSP
pipeline team3. The normalized ﬂux f (x) can be described
as follows:

f (x) =

x
I

·

arcsinh(αI)
arcsinh(α)

+ β,

(1)

where I = Σx∈{gri}/3 and x is the pixel value (fν ) on coadd
image in each ﬁlter. Standardization by the mean ﬂux
over the gri-band photometry (I) allows us to minimize
color saturation. We adopted default values of the scaling
parameter of α = exp(10) and the bias parameter of β =
0.05. In addition, we set the lower and upper limits to 0
and 1, respectively. Examples of the resultant color images
are shown in ﬁgures 4, 5, and 7.

2.3 Deep learning model

To achieve an eﬃcient classiﬁcation of spiral galaxies, we
apply transfer learning (see, e.g., Pratt et al. 1993; Oquab
et al. 2014) based on a deep learning model to the color
images constructed above. Because our previous study
(section 3.1 and ﬁgure 3 in Shimakawa et al. 2021) al-
ready demonstrated the application of transfer learning to

the galaxy images from the HSC-SSP, we brieﬂy summa-
rized the approach herein. As is the case with the spiral
classiﬁcation in Shimakawa et al. (2021), we attached the
Xception architecture (Chollet 2016) of a class of convolu-
tional neural networks (CNN; Lecun et al. 1998; Lecun
et al. 2015) to a two-class sigmoid classiﬁer, which is
pre-trained for 1000 class separation with the ImageNet
dataset (Russakovsky et al. 2014). The classiﬁer yields the
probability of spiral galaxy (ˆy = [0 : 1]) by the sigmoid func-
tion, through the layers that consists of a dense layer (lin-
ear transformation, d = 1024), batch normalization (Ioﬀe &
Szegedy 2015), and ReLU activation (≡ max(0, x); Glorot
et al. 2011), as illustrated in ﬁgure 1. To implement
of this model, we adopted a deep learning model using
TensorFlow (version 2.6.0; Abadi et al. 2016) and Keras
(version 2.6.0; Chollet et al. 2015), under a single GPU,
the NVIDIA TITAN RTX.

We prepared 6400 training data, 1600 validation data,
and 2000 test data for the model training. Through the
deep learning analysis, we adopted the gray-scale images
converted from the RGB color images (ﬁgure 2) to mini-
mize a color–morphology dependence (e.g., de Vaucouleurs
1961; Schawinski et al. 2014), although we treated them as
the data with three channels to tailor the input dimension
of the model architecture. For each data, half were random
non-spiral galaxies, and the other half were spiral galaxies
selected by the author’s visual inspection (RS). Because
they were originally based on the HSC-SSP PDR3 sample
at z = 0.01–0.3, the datasets partially overlapped with our
main targets (7239 out of 54871). Their image sizes were
scaled and homogenized to 200×200 pixels (the typical im-
age size in the sample) from the cutout size of (4 × R90)2
arcsec2 with a pixel width of 0.168 arcsec (ﬁgure 1).
In
addition, the image color channels were standardized sim-
ilarly as in the pre-training with the ImageNet (Chollet
2016) to leverage the pre-trained weight parameters.

Subsequently, we implemented the model training. An
optimizer tunes the model weight parameters to minimize
the binary cross-entropy loss, which is deﬁned as:

Loss ≡ −y log ˆy − (1 − y) log(1 − ˆy),

(2)

Fig. 2. Randomly selected image samples of the training data.

where y and ˆy are the target value {0, 1} and the model
prediction [0 : 1], respectively. We adopted an adaptive
learning rate optimization algorithm (Adam; Kingma & Ba
2014) as the optimizer, with a batch size of 32. The model
training begins with a default learning rate of lr = 1 ×
10−3 until the 20th epoch, which was changed to lr = 2 ×
10−4 in and after the 20th epoch. Further, we served a
general data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator in
the Keras library, which performs random image rotation
(< 90 deg) and horizontal and vertical ﬂips.

The model learning was conducted in 80 epochs, and
it took 5827 sec in our GPU environment. The resultant
training histories of the model accuracy and binary cross-
entropy loss are shown in ﬁgure 3. The model accuracy is
written as:

Accuracy ≡

T P + T N
T P + T N + F P + F N

,

(3)

where T P (or T N ) and F P (or F N ) indicate the true pos-
itive (or negative) and false positive (or negative) rates,
respectively. Here, the positive and negative classes pre-
dicted by the classiﬁer are separated by ˆy = 0.5. Among the
models in 80 epochs, we chose the best model with the least
cross-entropy loss in the validation data (ﬁgure 3). The
selected model provides a training accuracy of 99.5%, vali-
dation accuracy of 99.4%, and validation loss of 0.021. We
also obtained 98.9% accuracy in independent test data con-
sisting of 1000 spiral and 1000 non-spiral galaxies, which
were similarly selected as in the training and validation
data. From the test data, the precision (T P/(T P + F P ))
and recall (T P/(T P + F N )) rates were estimated to be
99.3% and 98.4%, respectively. Moreover, based on the
end result (section 3), we noticed the test data include 65

As a result, 2241 (9.9 percent) passive spiral candidates
satisﬁed the SSFR cut, which is signiﬁcantly lower than
a passive fraction of 50 percent in the original sample.
Within the selected spiral galaxies, we did not ﬁnd a red-
shift dependence of the passive fraction.

3.2 Visual conﬁrmation

Next, visual inspections for further validation were per-
formed by all authors independently. This visual check
was quite important for the passive spiral selection be-
cause contamination by ringed S0 galaxies to the spiral
sample becomes signiﬁcant in the passive population (see,
e.g., Buta & Combes 1996; Buta 2017). In the validation
process, suspicious candidates were tagged by the authors,
and then, we calculated a vote fraction for each candidate
(f vote = {0,1}; see table 2).
In conducting the visual
classiﬁcations, we ﬁrst established a consensus that obvi-
ous pseudo-ringed galaxies (Buta & Crocker 1991; Buta &
Combes 1996; Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004) were to be re-
garded as spirals, whereas we tagged visual check ﬂags for
non-spirals, merging galaxies, or ambiguous objects that
are diﬃcult to determine rings or pseudo-rings.

Figure 5 highlights suspicious samples that were re-
garded as non-spiral galaxies in the visual validation. They
mostly seem to be ringed or pseudo-ringed galaxies, as
shown in ﬁgure 5a-d. The remaining suspicious candi-
dates had unclear spiral features or peculiar substruc-
tures (ﬁgure 5e-g), for example, an oﬀset ring such as
the Cartwheel Galaxy (Fosbury & Hawarden 1977) and
a polar ring (Sandage 1961). Additionally, we found
two unique objects with diamond-shaped wings (id hsc3
= 41033924272474055 & 41034615762212336; table 2 and
ﬁgure 5h,i), which were also removed from the passive spi-
ral sample. They have a similar structure to local galaxies,
NGC 7020 (Buta 1990), NGC 4429 (Buta et al. 2007), and
IC 4767 (Whitmore & Bell 1988), which are reported as
peculiar S0 galaxies with hexagonal or X shapes. It would
be intriguing to investigate their kinematics and accretion
histories using a modern integral ﬁeld spectrograph, which
will address the formation mechanisms of such a peculiar
substructure.

Table 1 summarizes the results of our visual inspections.
To quantify the human bias in our visual validations, we
deﬁne a concordance rate (CR) by:

CR ≡ Ns(A|B) = Ns(A ∩ B)/Ns(B),

(5)

where Ns(x) is the number of suspicious objects (i.e., non
passive spirals) among the candidates (N = 2241) judged
by an author x; therefore, CR indicates that the number

tories of the training and validation data, respectively. This study adopts the

sented by the red-ﬁlled circle.

passive spirals. Although the sample size is small, these
passive spirals show the precision rate of 96.9% and the
recall rate of 100% for the classiﬁcation of spiral galaxies.

3 Identiﬁcations of passive spiral galaxies

3.1 Selection of passive spiral galaxies

First of all, we apply the well-tuned deep learning model to
the main targets, the 54871 bright galaxies at z = 0.01–0.3,
to choose spiral galaxies among them. Because our ﬁnal
sample consists of suﬃciently bright (rpetro < 18) and mas-
sive (M(cid:63) > 1010 M(cid:12)) galaxies at z < 0.3, we assume that
the redshift bias of the spiral classiﬁcation is negligible
(see also Tadaki et al. 2020). Automatic and eﬃcient deep
learning classiﬁcation enabled us to categorize such a large
amount of dataset in only 330 sec on the GPU environ-
ment. Figure 4 represents the frequency distribution and
image samples of the selected spirals on the SFR–M(cid:63) plane
derived by the GSWLC-2 (Salim et al. 2018). This study
deﬁnes as the spiral galaxies those with model prediction
values greater than ˆy = 0.5 (section 2.3), which amounts
to a total of 22720 sources (41% of the parent sample).
Because this study solely aims to establish a passive spiral
sample, we do not delve into more detailed shape measure-
ments of spiral structures and debiased values of such as
the spiral fraction, which are left to future research.

For the sample classiﬁed as spiral galaxies, we choose
candidates of passive spirals, located by an order of magni-
tude lower than the median-ﬁt line for the SFR–M(cid:63) distri-
bution of star-forming galaxies with speciﬁc SFRs, SSFR
> 10−11 yr−1 (ﬁgure 4):

Fig. 5. Sample gri images of the candidates judged to have non spiral features by PI’s visual inspection. Most of these suspicious sources are difﬁcult to
distinguish as either pseudo-ringed spirals or ringed S0 as seen in (a–d). For the rest, some sources seem to have unique morphologies, e.g., (e) galaxies with
an offset ring such as the Cartwheel Galaxy (Zwicky 1941), (f,g) polar-ring galaxies (Sandage 1961), and (h,i) galaxies with diamond-shaped wings surrounded
by an outer ring or disk. See the text for further explanations on visual checks and human bias.

ratio of overlapped non passive spirals in between authors
A and B (= Ns(A∩B)) to that in the author B (= Ns(B)).
The derived CR values between individual authors are also
summarized in table 1. The table indicates the signiﬁcant
variations in our visual check results (Ns = 570–1466) and
concordance rates, i.e., human bias, even among experts.
For example, the author 5 selected the least (Ns = 570)
as non spiral features from the candidates, most of which
(∼ 90 percent) were selected by the author 1, 2 and 6 as
well. On the other hand, 24–31 percents of non passive
spirals deemed by the author 5 were passed in visual vali-
dations by the author 3, 4 and 7. Meanwhile, the authors
1, 2 and 6 who selected more samples (N > 1300) as non-
spiral galaxies than the others, with ∼ 80 percent in agree-
ment. Such signiﬁcant variations in our visual validations
reﬂect diﬃculties in the visual classiﬁcation of passive spi-
ral galaxies. These inconsistencies would be mostly due to
the diﬃculty of distinguishing pseudo-ringed spiral galax-
ies from ringed S0 galaxies or interacting objects with tidal

tales, even with high-quality data from the Subaru HSC.
The viewing angles of galaxies in the sky would be another
factor causing the variations.

Based on the responses of our visual inspections, we
calculated the vote fraction for each object (flag vc =
[0:1]; table 2), which provides ﬂexibility for catalog users
to make their decisions on the sample selection from the
passive spiral catalog (table 2). Higher flag vc values in-
dicate less reliable passive spiral samples in our visual val-
idations. Image samples for each vote fractions are repre-
sented in ﬁgure 6, showing that the samples with higher
flag vc values tend to have less clear spiral features or
ring-like morphologies. If one wants to establish the most
secure passive spiral sample from our catalog, we recom-
mend using the sources with flag vc = 0, which are recog-
nized as having spiral features by all authors of this paper.
However, it should be noted that such a conservative se-
lection may overlook many pseudo-ringed spiral galaxies.

3.3 Passive spiral galaxy catalog

Our passive spiral catalog (table 2) and individual postage
stamps in png format can be downloaded on the HSC-
SSP PDR3 website (https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/
data-release/). Throughout of this paper, we employ
1100 candidates with flag vc < 0.5 as the passive spiral
galaxies, that is, we adopt the samples accepted by 4 or
more out of 7 authors of this paper in the last section 3.2.
The passive fraction of spiral galaxies after the visual
validations is 5.1% (from 1100/(22720 − (2241 − 1100)))4,
which is the same level as the red fraction of spirals (4–
8%) in the Galaxy Zoo (Masters et al. 2010). Whereas,
we note that this consistency includes both reducing and
increasing eﬀects from more conservative passive selection
using UV-to-IR data (Salim et al. 2018) and higher qual-
ity HSC imaging data (Aihara et al. 2021), respectively.
Example gri-composite color images of star-forming (ac-
tive) and passive spiral galaxies are shown in ﬁgure 7,
which clearly diﬀer in appearance: passive spirals are red-
der with smoother spiral arms than active spirals. All the
color images of the selected passive spirals are summarized
by supplemental material available online. Postage stamps
of the secondary samples with flag vc values (> 0.5),
which are not discussed hereafter, are also available as sup-
plemental material.

Moreover, we checked if they remained quiescent even
when we adopted the best-ﬁt physical properties based
on deeper GALEX data if available in the version of the
GSWLC-M or GSWLC-D (see Salim et al. 2016; Salim
et al. 2018). It turns out that 786 (818) and 158 (154) ob-
jects out of 1100 main (1141 secondary) samples were cov-
ered by GSWLC-M or GSWLC-D, respectively. As noted
in the literature, the depth of the UV data inﬂuences the
SFR measurement, especially for less-active galaxies. Once
we replaced their physical values with deeper UV data,

high success rate of the overall spiral classiﬁcation (section 2.3).

many of the passive spiral samples were located in the
green valley on the star-forming main sequence (ﬁgure 8)
and approximately half of them (339 and 82 out of 786 and
158 in GSWLC-M and -D, respectively) were shifted into
above the threshold of the passive population (Eq. 4). This
indicates that only deep optical data are inadequate to se-
lect truly passive spiral galaxies and suﬃciently deep UV
(and IR) data are crucial (see also Fraser-McKelvie et al.
2016). We note that no signiﬁcant diﬀerence existed in
the behavior of between SFRs from GSWLC-M and -D to
those from GSWLC-A. Consequently, our catalog provides
an additional validation ﬂag (flag uv), which yields “M”
or “D” if the candidates still satisfy the selection threshold
even if we adopt the catalog versions of GSWLC-M or -D,
respectively. However, we should note that this paper does
not adopt flag uv to maintain the homogeneous selection
of passive spirals over the entire survey ﬁeld.

Combined with the visual check ﬂag (flag vc), we of-
fer a comprehensive and ﬂexible source catalog (table 2)
to leave further decisions up to users. These validation
ﬂags are aimed at allowing users of our catalog to select
more (or less) secure passive spiral sources for follow-up
investigations, depending on their objectives.

4 Discussion

Based on 54871 spec-z sources at z = 0.01−0.3 from the
HSC-SSP PDR3 and the GSWLC-2, we established a pas-
sive spiral sample, in which 1100 objects are handled here
as the main sample. This section discusses the physical
properties and environmental eﬀects using EWHδ–Dn4000
and phase-space diagrams, respectively.

pared to those of the other galaxies. We examined the
4000 ˚A break strength (Dn4000) and the Balmer absorp-
tion line index (Hδ equivalent width, EWHδA ; Worthey
& Ottaviani 1997) of passive spirals, and compared them
with those of spiral galaxies and passive galaxies. The
so-called EWHδA –Dn4000 diagram has been widely used
to understand stellar populations of quiescent and post-
starburst galaxies (Blake et al. 2004; Yesuf et al. 2014; Wu
et al. 2021). While the Dn4000 is roughly interpreted as
the ages of stellar populations, the EWHδ responds to the
time scale of star formation history, which is the strongest
(> 5 ˚A) in 0.1–1 Gyr after starburst (Kauﬀmann et al.
2003; Wu et al. 2021).

We obtained Dn4000 and EWHδA values of our sample
from the MPE-JHU catalog (Kauﬀmann et al. 2003) by
searching for their counterparts within a 1 arcsec radius.
Among the 54871 samples, 50831 objects, including 970
passive spirals, are cross-matched with the MPE-JHU cat-

alog. The density distribution on the Dn4000 and EWHδA
diagram and normalized distributions in each axis for spi-
ral galaxies, passive galaxies, and passive spirals are shown
in ﬁgure 9a.

As a result, we found that passive spiral galaxies have
a distribution similar to that of general passive galaxies
more than active spirals on the Dn4000 and EWHδA plane
(ﬁgure 9c,d), where we randomly selected 10000 mass-
controlled passive galaxies and active spirals from the par-
ent samples to adjust the stellar mass distributions to that
of passive spirals (ﬁgure 9b). We conﬁrmed that such a
trend becomes more evident when we employed more se-
cure passive spirals from deeper UV data (flag uv = M or
D; table 2). Because we selected passive galaxies with the
same threshold on the SFR–M(cid:12) plane (ﬁgure 4), the sim-
ilar distributions between these two samples suggest that
the passive spirals have identical characteristics to the typ-
ical quiescent galaxies in stellar populations despite the
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in their morphologies. Distributions
of Sersic (Sersic 1968) and Petrosian concentration indices
(Shimasaku et al. 2001) for passive spiral galaxies in the
SDSS r-band are more similar to those of typical quiescent
galaxies than active spirals. These concentration measure-
ments were taken from the NYU-VAGC catalog (Blanton
et al. 2003; Blanton et al. 2005) by spatial cross-matching
within 1 arcsec (52166 sources, including 1009 passive spi-
rals, were successfully matched).

The results may suggest that star formation histories
and galaxy morphology transitions are not always cou-
pled, and the quenching timescales of spiral galaxies are
very slow (∼ a few Gyr), as proposed by Schawinski et al.

(2014). However, it should be noted that the SDSS spec-
tra mostly trace bright central bulges of galaxies within the
ﬁbers of 3 arcsec diameter, which is smaller than the typi-
cal Petrosian half-light radius of 1.76 arcsec in our sample.
The concentration metrics show that passive spirals tend to
have bulge structures similar to those of typical quiescent
(non-spiral) galaxies; thus, the similar stellar populations
between these spectra are not surprising. An extensive
deep survey with an integral ﬁeld spectrograph is needed
to reach a consensus on the star formation histories of pas-
sive spiral arms.

4.2 Phase-space diagram

Previous studies have reported a higher frequency of
passive spirals at higher local densities (van den Bergh
1976; Goto et al. 2003; Masters et al. 2010), suggesting
that environmental eﬀects may be responsible for such a
high passive fraction of spiral galaxies. This study dis-
cusses the environmental quenching of spiral galaxies from
a more practical standpoint by leveraging a large pas-
sive spiral sample over 1072 square degrees. Speciﬁcally,
we cross-matched the main targets at z =0.01–0.3 (sec-
tion 2.1) with X-ray-selected clusters (∼ 1014−1015 M(cid:12)) by
SPIDERS (the SPectroscopic IDentiﬁcation of eROSITA
Sources; Clerc et al. 2016) to examine the dynamical asso-
ciations of passive spirals with massive clusters. Because
the SPIDERS catalog oﬀers virial radii (R200) and veloc-
ity dispersion (σv), we can easily test the association of
passive spirals with clusters on the phase-space diagram
(Bertschinger 1985) by stacking all individually matched

cluster members to the cluster sources. The phase-space
diagram provides a useful clue on the dynamical states
of galaxy clusters and the trajectory of galaxies infalling
towards the cluster center (Sanchis et al. 2004; Mahajan
et al. 2011; Jaﬀ´e et al. 2015; Oman & Hudson 2016; Yoon
In this study, the phase-space diagram en-
et al. 2017).
ables us to infer where spiral galaxies are inclined to be
passive during their infall into the clusters.

We obtained 1148 cluster members associated with 123
clusters within the scaled projected radii (r/R200 < 2.5)
and velocity oﬀsets (|∆v/σv| < 2.6). Among the matched
cluster members, 250 and 35 sources were classiﬁed as spi-
ral and passive spiral galaxies, respectively. The average
passive fraction of spiral galaxies in the clusters (14%) was
approximately thrice as high as that in random ﬁelds (5%).
Figure 10 shows the positions of all cluster members on the
projected phase-space diagram. The ﬁgure also indicates
the escape velocity and virialized region proposed by Jaﬀ´e
et al. (2015), deﬁning the orbital states on the projected
phase-space diagram more realistically than in previous
studies.

The very center of the galaxy clusters lacks spiral galax-
ies (ﬁgure 10), which is well known as the morphology–
density relation (e.g., Dressler 1980; Cappellari et al. 2011);
we also obtained a non-uniform distribution of passive spi-
rals to the entire spiral galaxies in the cluster environ-
ments. We detected a substantial excess of passive spiral
galaxies reaching up to ∼ 50% on this diagram in the area
of r/R200 = 0.3−1 and |∆v/σv| <
∼ 1, where galaxies are ex-
pected to experience core crossing more than once (e.g.,
Jaﬀ´e et al. 2015; Yoon et al. 2017).
It is quite reason-
able to see such a biased distribution owing to the trun-
cation of the continuous Hi gas supply due to the ram
pressure stripping in the earlier infall phase (Hamabata
et al. 2019). Previous studies have reported that spi-
ral galaxies inﬂuenced by the ram pressure stripping were
found in the 1st infall (|∆v/σv| = 1−2.5 and r/R200 < 1.3)
and backsplash (|∆v/σv| ≤ 0.5 and r/R200 = 1.2−2) ar-
eas (see, e.g., Yoon et al. 2017, ﬁgure 5). Thus, our
results provide strong independent support for the con-
clusions presented in previous studies that ram pressure
stripping enhances the fraction of passive spirals in clus-
ter environments (Bothun & Sullivan 1980; Giovanelli &
Haynes 1983; Cayatte et al. 1994; Bravo-Alfaro et al.
2001; Elmegreen et al. 2002; Boselli et al. 2006). We
also observed some passive spirals in cluster outskirts
(r > R200), which may have been formed through the pre-
processing in falling subclusters (Fujita 2004; Rhee et al.
2020).

Finally, the environmental eﬀects would not be the only
causal factors that transform star-forming spirals into pas-

these special morphological types are beyond the scope of
this study, they would provide us with further insight into
the formation mechanisms of galaxy morphologies.

We also found that the characteristics of stellar pop-
ulations in passive spirals inferred from the EWHδA and
Dn4000 indices were similar to those of typical quiescent
galaxies. Further research is required to understand the
basis for such morphological discrepancies between gen-
eral quiescent galaxies and passive spirals; for instance,
IFU observations in the optical regime (Ishigaki et al.
2007) and high-resolution cold gas observation with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)

vestigated the kinematic positions of passive spirals as-
sociated with X-ray clusters on the phase-space diagram.
We then detected the peak fraction of the passive spi-
rals over spiral galaxies around the midterm to late in-
fall phase on the phase-space plane, supporting the ram
pressure scenario, which has been widely suggested in
previous studies (Bothun & Sullivan 1980; Giovanelli &
Haynes 1983; Cayatte et al. 1994; Bravo-Alfaro et al.
2001; Elmegreen et al. 2002; Boselli et al. 2006).

The current passive spiral sample still relies highly on
visual inspection, especially to divide passive spirals with
ringed S0 galaxies.
Such a time-consuming procedure
should be automated when the large next-gen datasets are
delivered by such as the LSST project on the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory (Ivezi´c et al. 2019) and the High Latitude
Wide Area Survey with the Nancy Grace Roman Space
Telescope (Spergel et al. 2015). To achieve a more eﬀec-
tive classiﬁcation, the citizen science project dedicated to
the HSC data, the GALAXY CRUISE program, will be quite
useful for the creation of the training data, which provides
us with not only the spiral classiﬁcation but also the pres-
ence or absence of the ring feature. Thus, future updates
combined with the GALAXY CRUISE data will enable us to
conduct more eﬀective and comprehensive classiﬁcations.

sive spirals because passive spirals are observed in low-
density environments and in the vicinity of galaxy clusters
and groups (see also Masters et al. 2010). Nevertheless,
our results suggest that the environmental eﬀects can ex-
tend the passive spiral phase and/or help spiral galaxies to
be quiescent.

5 Conclusion

Based on the deep learning morphology classiﬁcation for
the HSC-SSP PDR3 imaging data, we constructed 1100
passive spiral samples at z < 0.3 over 1072 deg2, which are
in a quiescent phase as inferred from their UV to mid-IR
SEDs by the GSWLC-2 catalog (Salim et al. 2016; Salim
et al. 2018). As a result, we obtained 1100 relatively reli-
able passive spirals and 1141 secondary samples consisting
of ringed S0, pseudo-ringed galaxies, and false detection or
peculiar types through visual inspection. Validation ﬂags
based on visual inspections by authors and selections with
deeper UV data will allow users to ﬂexibly select more
(or less) secure passive spirals. All data related to this
study are publicly available on the data release site of
the HSC-SSP PDR3 (https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/
data-release/). Our large passive galaxy sample will help
ones to delve into more detailed properties of passive spi-
rals in individuals to unveil the late evolutionary phase
of spiral galaxies. Some secondary samples have unique
structures, such as polar rings and diamond wings. While
