Abstract—Action recognition is an important and challeng-
ing problem in video analysis. Although the past decade has
witnessed progress in action recognition with the development
of deep learning, such process has been slow in competitive
sports content analysis. To promote the research on action
recognition from competitive sports video clips, we introduce a
Figure Skating Dataset (FSD-10) for ﬁnegrained sports content
analysis. To this end, we collect 1484 clips from the worldwide
ﬁgure skating championships in 2017-2018, which consist of 10
different actions in men/ladies programs. Each clip is at a rate
of 30 frames per second with resolution 1080 × 720. These clips
are then annotated by experts in type, grade of execution, skater
info,
.etc. To build a baseline for action recognition in ﬁgure
skating, we evaluate state-of-the-art action recognition methods
on FSD-10. Motivated by the idea that domain knowledge is
of great concern in sports ﬁeld, we propose a keyframe based
temporal segment network (KTSN) for classiﬁcation and achieve
remarkable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that
FSD-10 is an ideal dataset for benchmarking action recognition
algorithms, as it requires to accurately extract action motions
rather than action poses. We hope FSD-10, which is designed
to have a large collection of ﬁnegrained actions, can serve as
a new challenge to develop more robust and advanced action
recognition models.

I. INTRODUCTION
Due to the popularity of media-sharing platforms(e.g.
YouTube), sports content analysis (SCA[31]) has become
an important research topic in computer vision [39][10][30].
A vast amount of sports videos are piled up in computer
storage, which are potential resources for deep learning. In
recent years, many enterprises (e.g. Bloomberg, SAP) have
focus on SCA[31]. In SCA, datasets are required to reﬂect
characteristics of competitive sports, which is a guarantee for
training deep learning models. Generally, competitive sports
content is a series of diversiﬁed, high professional and ulti-
mate actions. Unfortunately, existing trending human motion

datasets (e.g. HMDB51[18], UCF50[34]) or action datasets of
human sports (e.g. MIT Olympic sports[28], Nevada Olympic
sports[24]) are not quite representative of the richness and
complexity of competitive sports. The limitations of current
datasets could be summarised as follows: (1) Current tasks
of human action analysis are insufﬁcient, which is limited to
action types and contents of videos. (2) In most classiﬁcation
tasks, discriminant of an action largely depends on both static
human pose and background; (3) Video segmentation, as an
important task of video understanding (including classiﬁcation
and assessment
is rarely discussed in current
datasets.

in SCA ),

To address the above issues, this paper proposes a ﬁgure
skating dataset called FSD-10. FSD-10 consists of 1484 ﬁgure
skating videos with 10 different actions manually labeled.
These skating videos are segmented from around 80 hours
of competitions of worldwide ﬁgure skating championships
1 in 2017-2018. FSD-10 videos range from 3 seconds to 30
seconds, and the camera is moving to focus the skater to ensure
that he (she) appears in each frame during the process of
actions. Compared with existing datasets, our proposed dataset
has several appealing properties. First, actions in FSD-10 are
complex in content and fast in speed. For instance, the complex
2-loop-Axel jump in Fig. 1 is ﬁnished in only about 2s. It’s
worth note that the jump type heavily depends on the take off
process, which is a hard-captured moment. Second, actions of
FSD-10 are original from ﬁgure skating competitions, which
are consistent in type and sports environment (only skater
and ice around). The above two aspects create difﬁculties for
machine learning model to conclude the action types by a
single pose or background. Third, FSD-10 can be applied to
standardized action quality assessment (AQA) tasks. The AQA
of FSD-10 actions depends on base value (BV) and grade of
execution (GOE), which increases the difﬁculty of AQA by
both action qualities and rules of International Skating Union
(ISU)2. Last, FSD-10 can be extended to more tasks than the
mentioned datasets.

Along with the introduction of FSD-10, we introduce a key
frame indicator called human pose scatter (HPS). Based on
HPS, we adopt key frame sampling to improve current video
classiﬁcation methods and evaluate these methods on FSD-

10. Furthermore, experimental results validate that key frame
sampling is an important approach to improve performance of
frame-based model in FSD-10, which is in concert with cogni-
tion rules of human in ﬁgure skating. The main contributions
of this paper can be summarised as follows.

• To our best knowledge, FSD-10 is the ﬁrst challenging
dataset with high-speed, motion-focused and complex
sport actions in competitive sports ﬁeld, which introduces
multiple tasks for computer vision, such as (ﬁne grained)
classiﬁcation, long/short temporal human motion segmen-
tation, action quality assessments, and program content
assessment in time to music.

• To set a baseline for future achievements, we also bench-
mark state-of-the-art sport classiﬁcation methods on FSD-
the key frame sampling is proposed to
10. Besides,
capture the pivotal action details in competitive sports,
which achieves better performance than state-of-the-art
methods in FSD-10.

In addition,compared to current datasets, we hope FSD-10
will be a standard dataset which promotes the research on
background-independent action recognition, allowing models
to be more robust to unexpected events and generalize to novel
situations and tasks.

II. RELATED WORKS

Current action datasets could be divided into human action
dataset (HAD) and human professional sports dataset (HPSD),
which are listed in Tab. I. HAD consists of different kinds of
broadly deﬁned human motion clips, such as haircut and long
jump. For example, UCF101[34] and HMDB[18] are typical
cases of HAD, which have greatly promoted the process of
video classiﬁcation techniques. In contrast, HPSD is a series of
competitive sports actions, which is proposed for action quality
assessment (AQA) tasks except classiﬁcation. MIT Olympic
sports[28] and Nevada Olympic sports[25] are examples of
HPSD, which are derived from Olympic competitions.

Classiﬁcation in HPSD is important to attract people’s atten-
tion and to highlight athlete’s performance, and even to assist
referees [16][46][1]. The signiﬁcant difference between video
classiﬁcation and image classiﬁcation is logical connection
relationship in video clips [2], which involve motion besides
form (content) of frames. Therefore, human action classiﬁ-
cation task should be implemented based on temporal human
information without background rather than static action frame
information. H.kuehne et al. [18] mentioned that the recogni-
tion rate of static joint locations alone in UCF sports [29]
dataset is above 98% while the use of joint kinematics is not
necessary. The result above obviously violates to the principle

of video classiﬁcation task. Thus, both motion and pose are
indispensable modalities in human action classiﬁcation [7].

Besides classiﬁcation of HPSD, AQA is an important but
unique task in HPSD. Some AQA datasets have been proposed,
such as MIT Olympic sports dataset[28], Nevada Olympic
sports dataset[25] and AQA-7[24], which predict the action
performance of diving, gymnastic vault, etc. In this ﬁeld,
Parmar et al. [26] adopts C3D features combining regression
with the help of SVR[6] (LSTM[12]), which gets satisfactory
results. The development direction of HPSD is clearly given
by the above works while AQA still remains to be devel-
oped as the materials of these datasets is still inadequate.

It could be concluded that
gradually expanded with the development of video techniques
[17][9][27][43][32]. However, it lacks temporal segmentation
related datasets in recent years. Our proposed FSD-10 is a
response to these issues. As far as we know, FSD-10 is the
ﬁrst dataset which gather actions task types including action
classiﬁcation, AQA and temporal segmentation.

III. FIGURE SKATING DATASET

In this section, we describe details regarding the setup and
protocol followed to capture our dataset. Then, we discuss the
temporal segmentation and assessment tasks of FSD-10 and
its future extensions.

A. Video Capture

In FSD-10, all the videos are captured from the World
Figure Skating Championships in 2017-2018, which originates
from high-deﬁnition record on YouTube. The source video
materials have large ranges of fps (frame per second) and
image size, which are standardized to 30 fps and 1080 × 720
to ensure the consistency of the dataset respectively. As for
the content, the programs of ﬁgure skating can be divided into
four types, including men short program, ladies short program,
men free skating and ladies free skating. During the skating,
camera is moving with the skater to ensure that the current
action can be located center in videos. Besides, auditorium
and ice ground are collectively referred to the background,
which are similar and consistent in all videos.

B. Segmentation and Annotation

To meet the demand of deep learning and other machine
learning models, video materials are manually separated into
action clips by undergraduate students. Each clip is ranging
from 3s to 30s, the principe of the segmentation is to com-
pletely reserve action content of videos, in other words, warm-
up and ending actions are also included. Actions type, base
value (BV), grade of execution (GOE), skater name, skater
gender, skater age, coach and music are recorded in each
clip. A detailed record example of one clip is shown in Tab.
II. Unfortunately, the distribution of actions is out of tune,

as different kinds of actions are totally 197 and the number
of each class of action instances is from 1 to 223. To avoid
insufﬁcient training, our FSD-10 is composed of the top 10
actions (as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Generally speaking, these
selected actions could fall into three categories: jump, spin
and sequence. And in details, ChComboSpin4, FlyCamelSpin4,
ChoreoSequence1, StepSequence3, 2Axel, 3Loop, 3Flip, 3Axel,
3Lutz and 3Lutz 3Toeloop are included.

C. Action Discriminant Analysis

Compared with existing sports, ﬁgure skating is hardly
distinguished in action types. The actions in ﬁgure skating
look like tweedledum and tweedledee, which are difﬁcult to
distinguish in classiﬁcation task. (1) It is difﬁcult to judge the
action type by human pose in a certain frame or a few frames.
For instance, Loop jump and Lutz jump are similar in warm-
up period, it is impossible to distinguish them beyond take-off
process. (2) The difference between some actions exists on a
subtle pose in ﬁxed frames. For example, Flip jump and Lutz
jump are both picking-ice actions, which are same in take-off
with left leg and picking ice with right toe. The only subtle
difference of the two types of jump is that takes-off process of
Flip jump is by inner edge while Lutz jump is by outer edge.
(3) The spin direction is uncertain. The rotational direction of
most skaters is anticlockwise while that of others is opposite
(e.g. Denise Biellmann). These factors of the above issues
make classiﬁcation task of FSD-10 a challengeable problem.

D. Temporal Segmentation and Assessment

• Action Quality Assessment (AQA). AQA would be
emerged as an imperative and challengeable issue in
ﬁgure skating, which is used to evaluate performance
level of skaters in skating programs by BV score plus
GOE score. As shown in Sec. III-B, BV and GOE are
included in our dataset, which are mainly depend on
action types and skater’s action performance respectively.
The key points of AQA are summarised as follows. (1)
BV is depend on action types and degree of action
difﬁculty. Besides, 10% bonus BV score is appended
on the second half of a program. (2) During the aerial
process, insufﬁcient number of turns and raising hands
cause GOE deduction and bonus respectively. (3) It is
caused GOE deduction of one action by hand support,
turn over, paralleling feet and trip during the landing
process.

• Action Temporal Segmentation(ATS). It is indicated
that ATS is also a signiﬁcant issue of FSD-10. A standard
action is of certain stages. For example during the process
of a jump action, four stages are commonly included,
which are preparation, take-off process, spinning in the
air and landing process. Separating these steps is a key
technical issue for AQA and further related works.

• Long Sequence Segmentation and Assessment (LSSA).
Another important
issue is LSSA, which is different
from AAS in sensitivity of actions order. Action order
and relation need to be considered in LSSA, which is
summarised as follows. (1) LSSA is the total of all the
single action score, which is calculated similar to AQA
for each action. (2) It is caused a fail case 3 when the
twice appearance of same action.

E. Future Extension

Our proposed FSD-10 is sensitive to domain knowledge and
abundant in practical tasks. Besides the tasks in Sec. III-D ,

3The twice appearance action will have a zero score whether it is successful

or not.

FSD-10 is convenient to be extended into other ﬁelds. For
example, pair skating is also a worth noting program in ﬁgure
skating. In the pair skating, to throw one skater by another is
a classical item, and the action in the air could be illustrated
as a corresponding jump action in men/ladies programs. To
transfer single skating models to pair skating ones is an
interesting open problem, which could be deemed as a kind
of transfer learning[23][45] or meta learning[19][14]. Besides,
action reasoning[8][38] is an interesting issue. For example,
it is straightforward to conclude a 3Lutz-3Toeloop jump if
single 3Lutz jump and 3toeloop jump have been recognized. In
addition, coordination between the action and the other sports
elements such as program content assessment by rhythmical
actions in time to music is also a focused issue. Fortunately,
the corresponding music of actions is included in FSD-10. It
is to be explored whether the music ups and downs is related
to the action rhythm, which is an exciting cross-data-modality
learning task.

IV. KEYFRAME BASED TEMPORAL SEGMENT NETWORK
(KTSN)

In this section, we give a detailed description of our
keyframe based temporal segment network. Speciﬁcally, we
ﬁrst discuss the motivation of key frame sampling in Sec.
IV-A. Then, sampling method of key frame is proposed in
Sec. IV-B and IV-C. Finally, network structure of KTSN is
detailedly introduced in Sec. IV-D.

A. Motivation of Key Frame Sampling

To solve the problem of long-range temporal modeling, a
sampling method called segment based sampling is proposed
by temporal segment networks(TSN)[40]. The main idea of
segment based sampling is “the dense recoded videos are
unnecessary for content which changes slowly”. The method
is essentially a kind of sparse and global sampling, which
is signiﬁcant in improving recognition performance of long-
range videos. But an intractable problem is caused that it is
unbeﬁtting for fast changing videos. Especially for tasks like
ﬁgure skating, which is complex in content and fast in speed.
It is illustrated in Sec. III-C that actions of ﬁgure skating are
similar in most of frames, and the only difference lies on
certain frames. Therefore, for sampling problem, we propose
a method to sample key frames by domain knowledge and to
sample other frames by segment based sampling. It is then
focus on how to sample key frames in segmentation based
sampling.

The problem motivates us to explore an indicator of sam-
pling by domain knowledge in ﬁgure skating. For example,
by observing the process of jump, we ﬁnd that arms and legs
move following speciﬁc rules during the process. Thus, we are
encouraged to deﬁne an indicator using anatomical keypoints
to measure this kind of rules, which is called Human Pose
Scatter and is illustrated in the next section.

B. Human Pose Scatter (HPS)

Before key frame sampling, we will introduce HPS for a
preparation. HPS is an indicator which is denoted by the

scatter of arms and legs relative to the body. The main
positions of human (left eye, right eye, etc. ) are marked by
the open-pose algorithm, which is shown in Fig. 4. Next, HPS
is introduced in the rest of this section.

Fig. 4. The sketch map of human pose scatter. A 18-anatomical-keypoints
recognition algorithm called open-pose[4][3][33][41] is adopted to get the
spatial position and anatomical structure of human in one frame.

As shown in Fig. 4, given a frame matrix of the responding
anatomical structure, X = [x1, · · · , xn] ∈ RD×n (in this
paper D = 2 and n = 18), in which each row corresponds to a
particular feature while each column corresponds to a human
anatomical keypoint, and ¯x is the column mean value of X.
Then, ˆX can be deﬁned as ˆX = [x1 − ¯x, x2 − ¯x, · · · , xi − ¯x].
Motivated by the principal component analysis (PCA[42]),
HPS can be deﬁned by Eq. 1. Projection matrix U (UD×d =
[u1, u2, · · · , ud], satisfying U T U = I, which leads I − U U T
the idemfactor) can be calculated by eigenvalue decomposition
(EVD) of ˆX ˆX T .

Actually, Eq. 1, only a formal expression of ζHP S, can
be easily rewritten as Eq. 2 to simplify calculation. In Eq.

4 have been
calculated during the EVD process. Therefore, Eq. 2 offers an
efﬁcient approach for calculation of ζHP S.

a tremendous help in ﬁnding key frames of sequences. For
example, during a process of jump, ζHP S of spin in the air
process is lower than it of the take off process, and extreme
point maps a turning point responding to some certain actions.
This can be referred to Fig. 1.

Key frame sampling is an important issue in video analysis
of ﬁgure skating, and the key frames should contain most
discriminant information of one video. In the ﬁgure skating
task, the fast changing motion frames are distinctly important
for jump actions. As illustrated in Sec. IV-B, the kind of
fast changing motion could be quantiﬁed as ζHP S by using
in a T frames clip of a
anatomical keypoints. Therefore,
video, the frame corresponding to extreme frame Oj∗ , which
ζ j
satisﬁes j∗ = argmax
HP S, is deﬁned as “the speciﬁc key
frame”, where δ indicates the near frame radius of Oj∗ , j ∈
{δ + 1, · · · , T − δ}. In addition, as nearby δ frames of Oj∗ ,
Gj∗ = {Gj∗,j∗−δ, · · · , Gj∗,p, · · · , Gj∗,j∗+δ} are deﬁned as
“key frames”, where p ∈ {j∗ − δ, · · · , j∗ + δ} \j∗(see Fig. 5).
In a multi-action clip, we will get Ol
j∗ , where l = 1, 2, · · · , L,
L indicates the number of extreme frames. Then, key frame
sampling could be described as follows. First, ﬁnding the
speciﬁc key frame(s) in action sequences. Second, sampling
the video from the speciﬁc key frame(s) and its nearby frames
using the similar approach of TSN. In one batch, TSN samples
a random frame while key frame sampling involves a random
frame Gl

j∗,p in Gj∗ ∪ Oj∗ .

D. Framework Structure

An effective and efﬁcient video-level framework, coined
keyframe based Temporal Segment Network (KTSN, Fig. 6),
is designed with the help of key frame sampling. Compared
with single frame or short frame pieces, KTSN works on

short snippets sampled from the videos. To make these short
snippets representative for the entire videos as well as to keep
the video is divided
computational consumption steerable,
into several segments ﬁrst. Then, sampling is continued on
each piece of snippets. As illustrated in IV-A, our sampling
methods are divided to two parts, which are segment based
sampling[40] and key frame sampling respectively. With the
sampling method, each piece contributes its snippet-level pre-
dictions of actions classes. And these snippet-level predictions
are aggregated as video-level scores by a consensus function.
The video-level prediction is more accurate than any single
snippet-level predictions for the reason that it captures details
of the whole videos. During the process of training, the model
is iteratively updated in video-level as follows.
segments

(Vvideo =
{α1, α2, · · · , αk} of equal duration pieces. One frame Tk
is randomly selected from its corresponding segment αk.
Similarly, One snippet Gl

corresponding Gl
j∗ , which have been proposed in section
IV-B and IV-C. The sequence of snippets (T1, T2, · · · , Tk and
G1
j∗,p) makes up of the model of keyframe
based temporal segment network as follows.

In Eq. 3, F(Tk; W ) (or F(Gl

behalf of a ConvNet[20] with model parameters W which plays
an important role in the snippet Tk (Gl
j∗,p) and obtain a con-
sensus of classiﬁcation hypothesis. It is given the prediction of
the whole video by an aggregation function G, which combines
all the output of individual snippets. Based on the value of
G, P works out the classiﬁcation results. In this paper, P is
represented as softmax function[22].

V. EXPERIMENTS
In order to provide a benchmark for our FSD-10 dataset, we
evaluate various approaches under three different modalities:
RGB, optical ﬂow and anatomical keypoints (skeleton). We
also conduct experiments on cross dataset validation. The
following describes the details of our experiments and results.

A. Evaluations of Methods on FSD-10

The state-of-the-art classiﬁcation methods of human action
are evaluated on FSD-10 in this section. In order to make
the experiments representative in action recognition ﬁeld, 2D
methods and 3D methods are selected respectively. TSN (or
KTSN) is selected as a 2D method, which is a typical two
stream structure. As for 3D methods,
two-stream inﬂated
3D ConvNet (I3D) with Inception-v1[36], Inception-v3[37]
and Resnet-50, Resnet-101[11] are involved for comparison.
Besides, anatomical keypoints related methods (st-gcn[44],
densenet[15]) are tested on our dataset for reference. As listed
in Tab. III, our proposed KTSN achieves state-of-the-art results

Fig. 6. Keyframe based temporal segment network. One input video is divided into k segments (here we show the k = 3 case) and a short snippet is
randomly selected from each segment. Meanwhile, n key frames are selected from the Video (here L = 1). The snippets are represented by modalities such as
RGB frames and Optical ﬂow. Then these snippets are fused by an aggregation function G. Last, P combines the outputs and makes video-level predictions.
ConvNets on all snippets share parameters.

C. Cross-dataset Validations

To verify motion characteristic of a sport video, the cross-
dataset validation is conducted on both classical dataset
UCF101 and FSD-10. RGB and optical ﬂow features are two
typical ways for action recognition. Generally speaking, the
RGB feature based method places emphasis on human pose
while the optical ﬂow based method attaches importance to
transformation between actions. It is illustrated in Tab. IV
that the performance differences between RGB and Optical
ﬂow of FSD-10 is greater than UCF101, which indicates
motion is more important than human static pose in FSD-
10. Besides, in sampling stage, FSD-10 is more sensitive to
ﬁne-grained segmentation, as the performance raises 5.4%
compared with 2.5% in UCF101 (3-segment-sampling to 9-
segment-sampling). In FSD-10, actions are sensitive to its
motion rather than its pose, which is consistent with the
original intention of the dataset.

TABLE IV
RESULTS OF CROSS-DATASET GENERALIZATION. UCF101 AND FSD-10
ARE TRAINED WITH TSN(k=3) AND TSN(k=9) RESPECTIVELY.

B. Evaluations between TSN and KTSN

The experimental results in Tab. III show that key frame
sampling is effective in sparse sampling. As illustrated above,
key frame is crucial for competitive sports classiﬁcation tasks.
Especially for jump actions, it is vital to choose take off
frames, which enhances discriminant of different jump actions.
An example of key frame sampling of jump actions is shown
in Fig. 5. By catching these key frames instead of random
sampling, KTSN achieves better classiﬁcation performance

and complex action content. We ﬁnd that motion is more
valuable than form (content and background) in this task.
Therefore, compared with other related datasets, our dataset
focuses on the action itself rather background. Our dataset
creates many interesting tasks, such as ﬁne-grained action
classiﬁcation, action quality assessment and action temporal
segmentation. Moreover, the dataset could even be extended
to pair skating in transfer learning and coordination between
action and music in cross-data-modality learning.

We also present a baseline for action classiﬁcation in FSD-
10. Note that domain knowledge is signiﬁcant for competitive
action classiﬁcation task. Motivated by this idea, we adopt key-
frame based temporal segmentation sampling. It is illustrated
that action sampling should focus more on related frames of
motion. The experimental results demonstrate that the key
frame is effective for skating tasks.

In the future, more diversiﬁed action types and tasks are
intended to be included to our dataset, and more interesting
action recognition methods are likely to be proposed with the
help of FSD-10. We believe that our dataset will promote the
development of action analysis and related research topics.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL

1. Training of KTSN

Architectures Inception network, chosen in KTSN, is a
milestone in CNN classiﬁer. The main characteristics of in-
ception network is the inception module, which is designed to
process the features in different dimensionality (such as the
1×1, 3×3 and 5×5 convolution core) parallelly. The result of
Inception network is a better representation than single-layer-
networks, which is excellent in local topological structure.
Speciﬁcally, Inception v3 is selected in the experiments as
follows.

Input Our model is based on spatial and temporal level,
which are corresponding to RGB frames[35] and optical
ﬂow[13] respectively. RGB mode is an industrial standard
of color, combining Red, Green and Blue into chromatic
frames, which is also called the spatial ﬂow. Besides, optical
ﬂow mode derives from calculating the differences between
adjacent frames, which indicates temporal ﬂow.

2. Confusion Matrix of Actions

It’s signiﬁcant to involve domain knowledge in competitive
sports content analysis. It is illustrated the confusion relation-
ships between actions by examples in Sec. 3.3, and this part is
a validation, as shown in Fig. 7. First, the skating spin obtains
the best classiﬁcation results, this is because it could judge
a skating spin of video precisely with a few isolated frames
using deep networks. Second, the skating jump is the most
difﬁcult to distinguish. It’s worth note that up to 24% Lutz
jump actions are identiﬁed as Flip jump actions.
