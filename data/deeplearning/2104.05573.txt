ABSTRACT
Creating high performance implementations of deep learn-
ing primitives on CPUs is a challenging task. Multiple con-
siderations including multi-level cache hierarchy, and wide
SIMD units of CPU platforms influence the choice of pro-
gram transformations to apply for performance optimization.
In this paper, we present machine learning powered compiler
techniques to optimize loop nests. We take a two-pronged
approach to code optimization: We first apply high level op-
timizations to optimize the code to take optimal advantage
of the cache memories. Then, we perform low level, target-
specific optimizations to effectively vectorize the code to run
well on the SIMD units of the machine. For high level opti-
mizations, we use polyhedral compilation techniques and
deep learning approaches. For low level optimization, we use
a target specific code generator that generates code using vec-
tor intrinsics and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to
find the optimal parameters for the code generator. We per-
form experimental evaluation of the developed techniques
on various matrix multiplications that occur in popular deep
learning workloads. The experimental results show that the
compiler techniques presented in the paper achieve 7.6X and
8.2X speed-ups over a baseline for sequential and parallel
runs respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION
Deep learning (DL) has become pervasive in various domains
of computing. Image recognition [14, 17], language model-
ing [10], language translation [31], speech recognition [15]
make extensive use of deep neural networks (DNNs). Deep
Learning inference is an important workload across appli-
cations, such as object classification & recognition, text and
speech translation etc. A 2018 Mc Kinsey study [5] pointed
out that in datacenters, 75% of the inference tasks are run on
CPUs. Optimizing DL workloads on CPUs is a challenging
proposition because of architectural complexities of CPU

platforms. Multi-level cache hierarchies, TLBs (Translation
Look-aside Buffers), hardware data prefetchers, SIMD (a.k.a
vector) units present particular challenges in writing high
performance code. Therefore, the current state-of-practice is
to use expert-coded high performance libraries such as Intel
oneDNN [3] in deep learning frameworks such as Tensor-
Flow and PyTorch to achieve good performance. However,
being reliant on libraries for performance is not scalable.
First, it would increase the time-to-market: from the time
a new DL operator is invented to its being supported in a
library could take a considerable amount of time. Second,
even expert programmers must invest significant amount of
effort to tune the implementations on the target platforms.
Therefore, an attractive alternative solution is to develop
compilation techniques that automate code optimization and
achieve similar performance levels as expert-coded libraries.
In this paper, we develop a systematic approach to auto-
matic code optimization. We categorize the program opti-
mizations into two phases: high level and low level optimiza-
tions. High level optimizations perform loop optimizations
such as loop reordering and tiling to derive a loop struc-
ture that utilizes the cache hierarchy of the computer sys-
tem to the fullest extent possible. Low level optimizations
generate vector code using the target machine’s intrinsics;
reinforcement learning methodology guides the derivation
of high performance vector code. For high-level and low-
level optimizations we leverage artificial intelligence (A.I.)
techniques. We evaluate our automated compiler system on
GEMMs which lie at the heart of deep learning [1]. The re-
sults indicate our compiler workflow delivers competitive
performance compared to Intel oneDNN library and signif-
icantly higher performance compared to a state-of-the-art
DL compiler, viz., AutoTVM [9].

The contributions of the paper are as follows.

 
 
 
 
 
 
• A systematic approach to program optimization with
clear demarcation of high-level and low-level optimiza-
tions that map well to the hardware architectures.
• Low-level optimizations that generate reinforcement
learning (RL) guided vector intrinsics based code.
• Development of A.I. techniques for high-level and low-

level optimizations.

• Experimental evaluation on various GEMM sizes that

occur in DL workloads.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces the overall compilation workflow. Section 3 de-
scribes the polyhedral compilation techniques we use for
high level optimizations. The low-level optimizations involv-
ing the target platform specific code generator and reinforce-
ment learning are developed in Section 4. The experimental
evaluation conducted is detailed in Section 5. Related work
is discussed in Section 6. The conclusion and implication of
the presented work are presented in Section 7.

2 THE COMPILER OPTIMIZATION

WORKFLOW

We first describe the overall compiler workflow. We input
the loop nests such as GEMMs to the compiler. The high
level optimizer first optimizes the loop structure and then
passes on the code to the low level optimer. Figure 1 shows
the workflow of the optimization process.

The high level optimizer uses polyhedral compilation tech-
niques for optimization of the loop structure to take advan-
tage of the multi-level caches of the CPU platform. The loop
reordering and tiling transformations are applied and the
best loop order and tile sizes are determined by the high
level optimizer. It will enhance data locality – both the spa-
tial and temporal locality such that the data used by the
input program is reused out of the caches closest to the pro-
cessor as much as possible. Section 3 details the polyhedral
compilation techniques we apply for loop optimization.

The high level optimer then hands over the optimized code
to the low-level optimizer. The low level optimizer derives a
vectorization strategy for effective use of the SIMD vector
units. We employ a target specific low level optimization
approach wherein the inner loops of the loop nest are vec-
torized using the target-specific vector intrinsics. Further,
we use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to
select the best vectorization plan among the myriad choices
available.

Jouppi et al [16] show that 95% of the deep learning infer-
ence workloads (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) can be formulated
in terms of matrix-multiplication. Matrix multiplication is at
the heart of deep learning [1]. Because of these reasons in
this work, we build the low level optimizer to optimize the
matrix-multiplications that occur in the inner most loops of

2

convolutions and matrix-multiplications themselves (matrix-
multiplication can be recursively defined where the other
loops of the code are the tiled loops and the inner loops
are also functionally equivalent to matrix-multiplication). In
Section 4, we describe the design and the implementation of
the low level optimizer for the inner loops of the loop nest
focused on matrix multiplication.

3 HIGH-LEVEL POLYHEDRAL LOOP

OPTIMIZATIONS

We use the polyhedral model [11], which is an advanced
mathematical framework to reason about dependences and
loop transformations, to develop our data reuse algorithm.

3.1 Preliminaries
We use the Integer Set Library (ISL) [27] for performing
polyhedral operations in this work and we use the same
notation as used in ISL to elucidate the concepts and the
algorithm. The matrix multiplication code shown in Figure
2 will be used to illustrate the workings of the data reuse
analysis.

Sets. A set is a tuple of variables 𝑥𝑖 s along with a col-
lection of constraints 𝑐𝑘 s defined on the tuple variables.
𝑠 = {[𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛] : 𝑐1 ∧ . . . 𝑐𝑚 }

The iteration spaces of loop nests are represented as sets.
The iteration space of the loop in Figure 2 is defined as the
following set. 𝐼 = {𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] : 0 <= 𝑖 < 𝑀 ∧ 0 <= 𝑗 <
𝑁 ∧ 0 <= 𝑘 < 𝐾 }

Relations. A relation is a mapping from input tuple vari-
ables 𝑥𝑖 s to output tuple variables 𝑦 𝑗 s. In addition, a set
of constraints 𝑐𝑘 s can be defined for a relation that will
place constraints on the input/output tuple variables. 𝑟 =
{[𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛] ↦→ [𝑦1, . . . , 𝑦𝑚] : 𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑝 }

The read and write access functions of a loop nest can
be modeled with relations. The read relations in the Figure
2 code are shown below: 𝑟1 = {𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] ↦→ 𝐶 [𝑖, 𝑗]}, 𝑟2 =
{𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] ↦→ 𝐴[𝑖, 𝑘]}, 𝑟3 = {𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] ↦→ 𝐵 [𝑘, 𝑗]}. The sole
write relation in the loop is: 𝑤1 = 𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] ↦→ 𝐶 [𝑖, 𝑗]. The
domain of a relation 𝑟 is denoted by dom 𝑟 .

Apply operation. When a relation 𝑟 is applied on a set 𝑠,
the domain of 𝑟 will be intersected with 𝑠 and the resulting
range will be a new set 𝑠 ′. The set 𝑠 ′ is said to be the result of
the apply operation. The operation is mathematically defined
as: ( (cid:174)𝑦 ∈ 𝑠 ′) ⇐⇒ (∃(cid:174)𝑥 s.t ( (cid:174)𝑥 ∈ 𝑠 ∧ (cid:174)𝑥 ↦→ (cid:174)𝑦) ∈ 𝑟 )

The data footprint of the loop can be computed by applying
read and write relations on the iteration space set: 𝑟1 (𝐼 ) ∪
𝑟2(𝐼 ) ∪ 𝑟3 (𝐼 ) ∪ 𝑤1(𝐼 )

Lexicographic operations. The lexicographical operations
can be applied on sets. 𝑠1 << 𝑠2 outputs all the elements

of 𝑠1 that are lexicographically strictly smaller than all the
elements of 𝑠2, while 𝑠1 <<= 𝑠2 gets us the elements of
𝑠1 that are lexicographically smaller than or equal to the
elements of 𝑠2. The lexicographically smallest element of a
set 𝑠 is queried using lexmin 𝑠. Similarly, the lexicographically
largest element is obtained using lexmax 𝑠.

Set difference. The set difference between set 𝑠1 and 𝑠2 is
denoted by 𝑠1 − 𝑠2, i.e., the resulting set will have elements
of 𝑠1 that do not appear in 𝑠2.

Polyhedral dependences. The exact data dependences in
loop nests can be computed in the polyhedral model and are
expressed as maps from source iterations to target iterations
involved in the dependence. For cache data reuse analysis
developed in §3.2, we consider four kinds of dependences –
Read-After-Read (RAR), Read-After-Write (RAW, a.k.a flow),
Write-After-Read (WAR, a.k.a anti), and Write-After-Write
(WAW). The data dependencies of the matrix multiplication
code in Figure 2 are shown below.

𝑑1 ={𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] ↦→ 𝑆 [𝑖 ′, 𝑗 ′, 𝑘 ′] : 𝑖 ′ = 𝑖 ∧ 𝑗 ′ = 𝑗 ∧ 𝑘 < 𝑘 ′ < 𝐾 }
𝑑2 ={𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] ↦→ 𝑆 [𝑖 ′, 𝑗 ′, 𝑘 ′] : 𝑖 ′ = 𝑖 ∧ 𝑘 ′ = 𝑘 ∧ 𝑗 < 𝑗 ′ < 𝑁 }
𝑑3 ={𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] ↦→ 𝑆 [𝑖 ′, 𝑗 ′, 𝑘 ′] : 𝑗 ′ = 𝑗 ∧ 𝑘 ′ = 𝑘 ∧ 𝑖 < 𝑖 ′ < 𝑀 }

The dependence 𝑑2 is induced by array reference A[i][k].
An element of array A, say A[0][0] which is accessed in
source iteration [𝑖 = 0, 𝑗 = 0, 𝑘 = 0] gets reused in target
iterations [𝑖 ′ = 0, 𝑗 ′ > 0, 𝑘 ′ = 0]. The source to target itera-
tion relationships such as this are expressed in a parametric
fashion as the relation 𝑑2.

3.2 Loop transformations
We create a number of code variants by applying loop re-
ordering and tiling transformations and using the PolyDL
techniques [25] select the top code variants.

Working set size computation. We perform cache data reuse
analysis to characterize a loop-nest’s behavior with respect
to a given cache hierarchy. The analysis computes the various
existing data reuses of a program and then for the input cache
hierarchy determines which data reuses are exploitable at
various levels of cache. Each data dependence in a loop is also
an instance of data reuse – the source and target iterations
involved in the dependence touch the same data element
and therefore, the data is reused. For a data dependence and
hence data reuse to be realizable in a given level of cache, all
the data elements accessed between the source and target
iterations of the dependence – the working set – have to be
retained in the cache so that when the execution reaches
the target iteration, the data element(s) used in the source
iteration will still be present in the cache.

We illustrate the computation of the working set sizes
using the running example in Figure 2. Let us examine the
following dependence carried by the 𝑗 loop arising because of
the array reference 𝐴[𝑖] [𝑘]: 𝑑2 = {𝑆 [𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘] ↦→ 𝑆 [𝑖 ′, 𝑗 ′, 𝑘 ′] :
𝑖 ′ = 𝑖 ∧ 𝑘 ′ = 𝑘 ∧ 𝑗 < 𝑗 ′ < 𝑁 }. Of all the source iterations,
the first/lexicographically minimum iteration is: I𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒 =
{𝑆 [𝑖 = 0, 𝑗 = 0, 𝑘 = 0]} Its target iterations are: {𝑆 [𝑖 =
0, 𝑗, 𝑘 = 0] : 0 < 𝑗 < 𝑁 }. Among the target iterations, the
first one is: 𝐼𝑚𝑖𝑛_𝑡𝑎𝑟 = {𝑆 [𝑖 = 0, 𝑗 = 1, 𝑘 = 0]} and the last
one is: 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥_𝑡𝑎𝑟 = {𝑆3 [𝑖 = 0, 𝑗 = 𝑁 − 1, 𝑘 = 0]}

accessed between I𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒 and 𝐼𝑚𝑖𝑛_𝑡𝑎𝑟 is derived by applying
the read and write relations on the intervening iteration set
and it is:

𝑊 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 2𝐾 + 3
The 𝐾 elements of array A – 𝐴[0] [0, 1, . . . , 𝐾 −1], the 𝐾 +1
elements of array B – 𝐵 [0, 1, . . . , 𝐾 − 1] [0] and 𝐵 [0] [1], and
finally 2 elements of array C – 𝐶 [0] [0], 𝐶 [0] [1] accessed
between the source iteration 𝑆 [𝑖 = 0, 𝑗 = 0, 𝑘 = 0] and the
target iteration 𝐼𝑚𝑖𝑛_𝑡𝑎𝑟 = 𝑆 [𝑖 = 0, 𝑗 = 1, 𝑘 = 0] lead to the
𝑊 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 size of 2𝐾 + 3.

The maximum working set size – the number of data

elements touched between I𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒 and 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥_𝑡𝑎𝑟 is:

𝑊 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑁 × 𝐾 + 𝑁 + 1
The 𝑊 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 size is arrived at by counting the number of array
elements accessed between the source iteration - 𝑆 [𝑖 = 0, 𝑗 =
0, 𝑘 = 0] and the target iteration - 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥_𝑡𝑎𝑟 = {𝑆3 [𝑖 = 0, 𝑗 =
𝑁 − 1, 𝑘 = 0]}. As far as array A is concerned, 𝐾 elements
of it – 𝐴[0] [0, 1, . . . , 𝐾 − 1] are read. Array B’s elements –
𝐵 [0, 1, . . . , 𝐾 − 1] [0, 1, . . . , 𝑁 − 2] plus 𝐵 [0] [𝑁 − 1] are read
which total 𝐾 × (𝑁 − 1) + 1. 𝑁 elements of array C are
read and written – 𝐶 [0] [0, 1, . . . , 𝑁 − 1]. Therefore, a total
of 𝑁 × 𝐾 + 𝑁 + 1 are read and written.

We have built a code generator to emit a number of pro-
gram variants. The code generator creates the loop variants
by applying tiling and loop interchange program transforma-
tions. The tile sizes are varied as well. The working set size
computation analysis is performed on each program version
generated. Among the many variants generated, the ranking
algorithm described below picks the top 𝑘 best performing
versions, where 𝑘 is a parameter.

DNN-based code ranking algorithm. We assume fully as-
sociative, and exclusive caches. If the working set size cor-
responding to a data reuse in the program is smaller than
the cache size then the data reuse is exploitable in the cache.
The ranking system considers caches at different levels (typ-
ically L1, L2, and L3) and for each data reuse, determines
at what level of cache hierarchy is the data reuse realizable.
We now describe the algorithm to determine the cumulative
working set sizes at each level of cache. The inputs to the
algorithm are the working set sizes computed for a loop nest,
and the cache sizes of the target system. The algorithm de-
termines the fastest level of cache where the working set
size corresponding to each data reuse fits and adds it to that
cache’s working set size. If a working set does not fit in any
cache, then the data reuse happens out of the main memory.
Consequently, the memory’s working set size is updated.

We use a deep neural network (DNNs) for ranking of code
variants. For the purposes of training the DNN model, we
collect the performance data of code variants generated and

variants. The DNN shown is a representative figure.

compute their working set sizes at different levels of the
memory hierarchy. We train the DNN model to perform rela-
tive ordering of two code variants. We then use a tournament
based ranking system to assign ranks to the different code
versions created – we play each code variant against every
other code variant. For each variant, we record the number
of wins it has accumulated. We then rank the variants based
on the number of wins – the higher the number of wins, the
higher the rank.

𝑥−𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛

We use a four layer feed forward neural network architec-
ture shown in Figure 3. We normalize the compiler generated
. Each
working set sizes using min-max scaling:
value is subtracted with the minimum value in that feature
column and divided by the feature range. The output layer
consists of two neurons and we use the softmax function
for the output layer. The values of the two output neurons,
because of the use of the softmax function, sum to 1. If the
output value is above a threshold - 𝜃 , we consider it a 1, oth-
erwise a 0. If the first neuron fires a 1, then the first variant
is considered the winner. If the second neuron fires a 1, then
the second variant is considered the winner. If both of them
are zero because none of them are above the threshold, then
it is a draw between the two variants. In this work, we set
the threshold 𝜃 to 0.7. We experimented with deeper mod-
els as well. However, depth beyond four did not have any
discernible effect on accuracy.

4 LOW-LEVEL TARGET SPECIFIC INNER

LOOP OPTIMIZATIONS

The high level optimizations as described in §3 are first ap-
plied to the input code and then the inner loops are handed
over the low level optimizer. The low level optimizer focuses
on vectorization and assumes that the data used by the inner
loops is resident in L1 cache. The inner loops are analyzed to
find out which loops are parallel and hence, vectorizable. The
different vectorizable loops present us multiple choices for
vectorization. Further, unroll-and-jam (the loops are unrolled
and the unrolled statements are combined in the inner-most

loop) can present various data reuse opportunities. Thus,
the various unroll factors for the loops give rise to multiple
ways of vectorizing the loops and we have to select a scheme
that leads to the highest performance. To help select the best
vectorization parameters, namely, the unroll factors for the
loops, we use Reinforcement Learning (RL).

4.1 Vector intrinsic based code generation
We illustrate the workings of the vectorization scheme and
the use of RL on GEMM inner loops. Figure 4 shows the
matrix multiplication code where the j loop is unrolled by a
factor of 16 and the statements are moved to the inner most
loop (unroll-and-jam). Because the j loop is parallel, it is vec-
torizable. We have built a code generator that generates the

vectorized code using the vector intrinsics of the target CPU
platform. Figure 5 shows the generated code using AVX-512
intrinsics to run on vector units that can work on 512 bits
of data simultaneously. The datatype of the variables in the
shown code is 32 bit floating point numbers. Therefore, we
can perform arithmetic operations on 16 floating point num-
bers (16 × 32 = 512) at the same time. In Figure 4, we observe
that the same array element – “A[i][k]” is used in all 16 arith-
metic operations. Therefore, it is broadcast to all elements
of the vector register using the _mm512_set1_ps vector in-
trinsic. The 16 elements of the C array – “C[i][j]” through
“C[i][j+15]” are loaded using the _mm512_load_ps vector
intrinsic. Since the loaded C elements are reused in all of the
inner-most k loop, the loading is hoisted out of the k loop. In
a similar fashion, the 16 elements of the B array – “B[k][j]”
through “B[k][j+15]” are loaded using the _mm512_load_ps
vector intrinsic. The 16 addition and multiplication opera-
tions are performed using the fused-multiply-add operation
through the intrinsic _mm512_fmadd_ps. After the C vector
is accumulated into in the k loop, the results are stored back

state. If the action leads to a higher performance, we will
encode it as a positive reward – the relative performance
increase. If the action causes the performance to degrade, it
is denoted as a negative reward – the relative performance
decrease. Figure 7 shows the RL set-up.

The agent will use a neural network to suggest next ac-
tions to undertake. While the state space exploration is be-
ing conducted, we will have two phases – exploration, and
exploitation. In the exploration phase, the agent will recom-
mend random actions and the reward obtained will be used
to continually train the neural network to predict actions
that will lead to larger positive rewards and thus higher per-
formance states. In the exploitation phase, the agent will
query the neural network for the best actions – actions that
will lead to the biggest rewards. The transitions between
the exploration and exploitation phases are controlled by
the exploration decay rate. We set it in such a way that at
initial stages exploration is selected more often, and later
exploitation is chosen more.

We train a neural network to encode the policy for RL –
whether to increment the unroll factors or two decrement
them. The neural network comprises of six intermediate lay-
ers – two blocks of Dense, Batch Normalization and Dropout
layers. For Dense layers we use Relu as the activation func-
tion. We set the drop-out rate of 0.25 for Dropout layers to
avoid overfitting. The output layer is a dense layer which
has as many neurons as the number of actions. For matrix
multiplication, there are 7 actions possible: 2 actions for each
unroll factor (whether to increment or to decrement) and a
special state to indicate no further action is necessary.

5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
We evaluate the performance of our compiler framework on
the GEMM operation for a range of matrix sizes. The GEMM
operation is, C = A.B where A, B, and C are matrices. Matrix
C is of size 𝑀 × 𝑁 , A of size 𝑀 × 𝐾 and B of size 𝐾 × 𝑁 .
We compare our compiler optimizations against three other
systems: 1) The matrix multiplication code shown in Figure
2 optimized to the highest levels using the Intel C compiler
– icc version 19.1.3.304 with the optimization flag -O3. For
parallel runs, we parallelize the outermost – ‘i’ loop with
OpenMP pragmas. We consider the resulting performance
to be the baseline. 2) The latest version of Intel oneDNN
library version v2.2. The oneDNN library is an expert coded
library for inter alia, GEMMs. 3) The latest release of TVM
[8] v0.7.0. We use the optimization guide published on the
TVM website for GEMMs [2] to obtain its performance. Ad-
ditionally, we tune the performance of TVM by exploring a
number of tile sizes and report the best performance among
the different tile sizes explored. The experiments are run on

into the C array using _mm512_store_ps outside of the k
loop.

In the GEMM code, all three loops – i,j, and k loops carry
data reuse. Consequently, when we unroll any of the loops,
that leads to reuse of the data of one of the three arrays – A,
B, and C. For example, in Figure 6, the i loops is unrolled by
a factor of 2 and it leads to reuse of the array B: The array
access expression for B is “B[k][j]” and it is free of the i
loop variable and therefore for all values of i, the same B
array element would be used. In the code we observe that
vecB is used in two fused-multiply-add operations – while
computing vecC and vecC1. When we unroll the inner-most
k loop, that helps us schedule the load and fma operations
further apart thereby increasing the chances of the data being
loaded in the vector registers when the execution reaches
the fma operations.

Thus, by unrolling various loops we can increase the data
reuse in vector registers, and schedule the load operations in
such a way that memory latency is tolerated well. However,
because the number of vector registers is limited, a certain
choice of an unroll factor for a loop will impose constraints
on the unroll factors of other loops. The interplay between
the amount of data reuse, scheduling, and the impact of
data reuse of different arrays could be complex. We use rein-
forcement learning which in turn uses a neural network to
determine the best unroll factors for the loops.

4.2 Reinforcement Learning
The choices of unroll factors for the inner loops constitute
the state space for reinforcement learning (RL). The agent
will suggest whether to increase unroll factors or to decrease
them. The increment/decrement of the unroll factors form
the actions. The target specific code generator will carry
out the actions suggested by the agent by generating code
with the new unroll factors and the code is run on the target
platform. The actions will either lead to a higher performance
or a lower performance vis-a-vis the performance of the prior

Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8280 (Cascade Lake) servers run-
ning at the frequency of 2.70 GHz. A single socket processor
has 28 cores, 32KB private L1 cache, 1MB private L2 cache,
and 39MB shared L3 cache.

5.1 Evaluation of Low-level optimizations
We first assess the efficaciousness of the low-level optimiza-
tion scheme we described in Section 4. To do so, we select
matrix sizes such that all the matrices will fit in in the pri-
vate L1/L2 cache of the processor and thus the code does not
require any loop transformations to enhance data locality.
We show the performances achieved on a single core of the
Xeon processor in Figure 10 by the ICC compiler – baseline,
our toolchain, and the oneDNN library. We run each code
a 100 times and report the average performance observed.
The baseline performance ranges from 0.18 GFLOPS/s (for
M = 16, N = 16, and K = 16) to 7.53 GFLOPS/s (for M = 128,
N = 128, and K = 128). The peak performance of a core of
the said Xeon system is ~118 GFLOPS/s. Thus, without any
further optimizations such as the ones we have described in
the paper, we observe that we obtain very low performance.
The oneDNN performance for all problem sizes save for M
= N = K = 128 is lower than ours. Our toolchain reaches a
sizable percentage of the machine’s peak performance. The
lowest performance gotten is 39.10 GFLOPS/s for M = N = K =
16, and the highest performance reached is 84.34 GFLOPS/s

for M = N = K = 128. As the problem size increases, the
work to be performed increases, and due to Instruction Level
Parallelism (ILP) and because the SIMD units can be kept
more busy, the performance goes up. The experiments show
that our target-specific code generation and reinforcement
learning scheme is extremely effective in vectorizing the
code well.

obtained by our compiler toolchain for all problem sizes are shown.

5.2 Evaluation of High-level and Low-level

optimizations together

We next conduct experiments to evaluate how well our com-
piler toolchain performs when we need to apply both high-
level and low-level optimizations: when matrix sizes are
larger and therefore necessitate loop transformations includ-
ing tiling to enhance data reuse in cache memories. Table 1
lists the matrix sizes we perform the experiments with. The
matrix sizes are drawn from various deep learning applica-
tions. We note that the matrix sizes are wide ranging and
therefore, test the versatility of our system in being able to
come up with high performance implementations for varied
matrix sizes.

Two-level tiling is applied on the matrix multiplication
code. Consequently, there are six tile sizes that need to be
selected. We choose the best tile sizes using the high level
optimization methodology described in Section 3: We first
create a number of code variants by varying the tile sizes. The
data reuse analyzer is run on each code variant and it outputs
the working set sizes. We execute the code variants on the
target machine and measure their performance. The working
set sizes and the performance data are used together to train
the DNN model for ranking of code variants. While training
the model, we use the training data corresponding to 70% of
the code variants. Once the model is trained, for each GEMM

size, we use the DNN model to select the top 10% best tile
sizes from the space of candidate tile sizes. For the top 10%
tile sizes thus selected, we apply low-level transformations
(Section 4) to vectorize the code.

Figure 9 shows the speed-ups achieved over the baseline
by our system, AutoTVM, and oneDNN library for sequential
runs. We show the performance obtained by our compiler in
absolute terms – in terms of GFLOPS/s for each problem size.
When dealing with problem sizes that are odd numbers or
when the optimal unroll factor for a loop does not divide the
corresponding tile size, then that leads to executing some
parts of the computation in scalar mode (and not vectorized).
For example, the “residue” code shown in Figure 5. It leads
to lower performance compared to when everything is run
in the vector mode. For example, for the problem sizes M
= 31999, N = 1024, and K = 84, the optimal unroll factors
through the high-level and low-level optimizations are de-
termined to be 4, 32, and 1 for the three loops respectively.
Because 4 does not divide 31999 exactly, it causes some part
of the computation to be run using scalar units. Our toolchain
achieves the highest performance of 60.7 GFLOPS/s for the
problem size M = 1632, N = 36548, K = 1024. For this prob-
lem size, the highest speed-up relative to the baseline code
achieved is: 17.96X. The lowest performance of 1.4 GFLOPS/s
is observed for M = 2048, N = 1, K = 128. The reason is, vec-
torization on the “j” loop as shown in Figure 5 is not possible

The absolute performances in GFLOPS/s

because the loop length of the “j” loop is 1. If we were to
vectorize on the “i” loop, that will induce non-contiguous
data accesses for the A and C matrices and loading of data
through vector-loads will not be possible. That explains the
low performance when N = 1. We obtain on average (geomet-
ric mean) speed-up of 7.6X over the baseline. The speed-ups
achieved by the AutoTVM system and the oneDNN library
are 4.9X and 13.7X respectively. In 8 out of 10 cases, our com-
piler outperforms AutoTVM. In oneDNN implementations,
data prefetch instructions are carefully inserted. For exam-
ple, low-level prefetch instructions such as prefetcht0 and
prefetcht2 which fetch data to all levels of cache and to L2
cache respectively are used extensively and that minimizes
the number of instances when the processor has to wait for
the arrival of data from memory. Inter alia, such software
data prefetching strategies employed in oneDNN explain its
higher performance.

We measure the performance of parallel code when it is
run on all 28 cores of the Xeon server. Figure 10 shows the
speed-ups over the baseline for the three systems. The base-
line code is parallelized as well. The average speed-ups over
the baseline for our compiler, AutoTVM, and oneDNN are
8.2X, 5.4X, and 15.3X respectively. For the first two problem
sizes, namely M = 128, N = 2048, K = 4096, and M = 320, N
= 3072, K = 4096, our compiler delivers higher performance
even compared to oneDNN. Our tool achieves the highest

performance of 1408 GFLOPS/s for the problem size M = 1632,
N = 36548, K = 1024. Incidentally, the highest performance
in sequential experiments is seen for the same problem size.
For that problem size, it represents the parallel speed-up of
23.2X on a 28-core machine. When the number of tiles of the
parallelized loop is not a multiple of the number of cores (28),
that leads to slight load imbalance among the cores. Con-
sequently, we are hindered from achieving a perfect linear
speed-up as the number of cores is increased.

6 RELATED WORK
In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the
application of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) techniques for pro-
gram optimization. The use of A.I. has been explored broadly
for two purposes: 1) for program representation in an embed-
ding space [4, 6, 18, 26], and 2) for performance optimization
[8, 9, 12, 20, 34, 35]. In the former use case, once a program
representation has been obtained then it has been used for
tasks such as code comprehension, similar code search etc.
In the latter case when A.I. has been applied for program
optimization, it has been used to find optimal program trans-
formations and optimal parameters for program transforma-
tions (such as loop unroll factors). Our work presented in
the paper fits the mold of the latter category where we use

eral closely related works and detail how our present work
improves upon and/or is different from prior works.

AutoTVM [9] uses machine learning approaches to derive
efficient execution schedules for tensor programs. It explores
the use of two distinct machine learning techniques: In the
first approach, from a given tensor program, domain specific
features such as memory access count, data reuse ratio etc
are extracted. Then, XGBoost, a form of decision tree based
learners are trained to perform relative ranking of schedules
based on their performance. In the second approach, the ten-
sor program is encoded into an embedding vector using the
TreeGRU method [24]. The relative performance prediction
of the schedules is performed on the encoding thus obtained.
FlexTensor [35] is a tensor computation optimization frame-
work for heterogeneous architectures. The hardware targets
for which FlexTensor can create high performance code in-
clude CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs. FlexTensor uses machine
learning techniques to derive optimized execution schedules.
It uses two machine learning approaches: neural networks
for performance prediction, and reinforcement learning for
navigating the space of possible schedules. The schedule
space is navigated using Q-learning [29] based reinforcement
learning. The Q-learning approach will guide the search –
along the directions of the search space with the best perfor-
mance. The performance prediction for different schedules
which is an input to the Q-learning algorithm is performed
using a feed-forward neural network.

Ansor [34] is a latest addition to the slew of TVM-based
auto-tuning systems. Ansor considers a larger schedule space
compared to the prior auto-tuning frameworks. Some of the
innovations in Ansor include, 1) organization of the search
space in a hierarchical manner 2) use of evolutionary search
techniques 3) specification of schedules by recursive appli-
cation of derivation rules 4) sampling of the search space
– by periodically running random schedules on the target
hardware to better guide the search.

Park et al [20] use machine learning to select the best pro-
gram transformation sequence among the available set of
program transformation recipes. They run a given input pro-
gram and obtain hardware counter values such as L1 cache
misses. Then, they also apply a sequence of program transfor-
mations and observe the achieved speed-up. The hardware
counters and the program transformations together are used
as features for training a machine learning model to predict
the speed-ups. Once the machine learning model is trained,
it is used as follows for selecting the best program trans-
formation sequence among a multitude of possibilities for
a given program. The unseen input program is run on the
target hardware and the hardware counters are read. The
hardware counters along with a transformation sequence
will be input to the trained machine learning model to predict

10

the speed-up that could be obtained for the transformation
sequence. The transformation sequence delivering the high-
est speed-up among various transformation sequences will
be selected.

Various hand written implementations of basic linear al-
gebra operations have been provided in various libraries
like oneDNN [3], BLIS [33], OpenBLAS [32], GotoBLAS [13].
ATLAS [30] is an autotuner where it generates various low-
level C-implementations and finds the best performing one
by executing the code on the target machine. POCA [23]
generates LLVM-IR based vectorized GEMM micro-kernel
where architecture independent optimizations can be applied.
AUGEM [28] is a template based code generator for DLA
(Dense Linear algebra) operations. It replaces the common
predefined C-code with the generated assembly level code.
Kevin et al. [22] use assembly level features for analytical
modeling of the SIMD code with Machine learning and find
the best loop transformations for vectorization. Monsifrot
et al. [19] use a Machine learning approach to find the best
unrolling factors.

Polyhedral compilation techniques have been developed
for source-to-source code transformation for better cache
locality and parallelization. The Pluto compiler [7] derives
an execution schedule for the code that attempts to minimize
data reuse distances. The effect of the Pluto transformation
will be that iterations that use the same data will be executed
close to each other in time and therefore, the code will be
cache friendly. However, the performance obtained by poly-
hedral tools including Pluto’s can be only slightly better than
that of back-end compiler’s such as Intel ICC’s and far from
other approaches such as AutoTVM’s [25]. In this paper, we
show that our techniques outperform AutoTVM. The reason
for the inability of the purely polyhedral approaches is, they
operate at a high level (source-to-source) and therefore, do
not perform low-level orchestration of vectorization, vec-
tor register allocation, detailed instruction scheduling (e.g.,
the kinds of low level optimizations we have described in
Section 4). The latter aspects are crucial to achieving high
performance.

In our present work, we identified two distinct program
optimizations that we need to concern ourselves with in or-
der to obtain high performance on the target architectures.
Because the high-level and low-level optimizations are dif-
ferent, we developed different A.I. techniques for them. For
high level optimizations we employed polyhedral compila-
tion techniques to extract features from loops and used a
deep learning model to identify loop transformations that
will yield high performance. For better vectorization, we
combined an intrinsics based code generator with reinforce-
ment learning (RL) to derive optimal parameters for the
code generator. We have combined traditional compiler tech-
niques with A.I. where appropriate. In particular, we have

used A.I. where an accurate cost model is difficult to define
and hence, we take advantage of A.I.’s unique ability to learn
from performance data.

7 CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented CPU-focused compiler techniques
for high-level and low-level program optimizations. The
high-level optimizations enhance data locality of programs
and the low-level transformations effectively vectorize code.
A.I. techniques in conjunction with polyhedral compilation
algorithms and target-specific code generator help us achieve
high levels of performance. We demonstrated that matrix-
multiplications which lie at the heart of deep learning can be
effectively optimized using the developed compiler toolchain.
The presented approach will help re-target the toolchain
to newer computer architectures seamlessly – only a new
target-specific code generator need be created, and the rest of
the toolchain can be repurposed without modifications. Thus,
the compiler framework described will enable realizing good
performance out-of-the-box for new hardware architectures
and new DL operators.
