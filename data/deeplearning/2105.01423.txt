Abstract. Space-time visualizations of macroscopic or microscopic traﬃc variables is a qualitative
tool used by traﬃc engineers to understand and analyze diﬀerent aspects of road traﬃc dynamics. We
present a deep learning method to learn the macroscopic traﬃc speed dynamics from these space-time
visualizations, and demonstrate its application in the framework of traﬃc state estimation. Com-
pared to existing estimation approaches, our approach allows a ﬁner estimation resolution, eliminates
the dependence on the initial conditions, and is agnostic to external factors such as traﬃc demand,
road inhomogeneities and driving behaviors. Our model respects causality in traﬃc dynamics, which
improves the robustness of estimation. We present the high-resolution traﬃc speed ﬁelds estimated
for several freeway sections using the data obtained from the Next Generation Simulation Program
(NGSIM) and German Highway (HighD) datasets. We further demonstrate the quality and utility
of the estimation by inferring vehicle trajectories from the estimated speed ﬁelds, and discuss the
beneﬁts of deep neural network models in approximating the traﬃc dynamics.

Keywords: Traﬃc ﬂow dynamics, traﬃc anisotropy, deep learning.

1 Motivation and Overview

Quantifying the road traﬃc conditions is an essential
prerequisite for several Intelligent Transport System (ITS)
applications such as urban traﬃc signal control, ramp-
metering, variable speed limits, and connected and au-
tonomous vehicles [12, 18, 29, 30]. Due to limited real-
time traﬃc observations from the ﬁeld, this is often per-
formed using data assimilation with macroscopic or mi-
croscopic traﬃc ﬂow models, statistical inference from a
large amount of historical traﬃc data, or, more recently,
structured machine learning techniques [17].

In this study, we demonstrate the learning of traﬃc dy-
namics from visualizations that are easily interpretable by
traﬃc engineers. A typical example is the macroscopic
traﬃc speed ﬁeld deﬁned over the space-time plane, such
as the one shown in Fig. 1(b). This plot contains a wealth
of traﬃc information − the traﬃc speed, the congested
part(s) of the road section, and the velocity and extent of
backward propagating stop-and-go waves. Although these
visualizations can be theoretically reproduced to some ex-

tent using microscopic traﬃc ﬂow models, those have a
high computational cost, need lots of data, and require
the problem to be well-posed. The key contribution of this
paper is to show that these visualizations can be used to
reverse engineer and learn the underlying traﬃc dynamics.

We use deep learning tools to learn the speed ﬁelds from
visualizations, partly motivated by their success in image
analytics and computer vision applications [9, 11]. Here,
we deﬁne the macroscopic speed ﬁeld over a discrete space-
time plane of ﬁne mesh size; we use 10m × 1s without loss
of generality. For our learning process, we show the neu-
ral network model samples of the speed ﬁeld containing
only partial information, and train it to reconstruct the

tial information can be provided by moving probe vehicles
or stationary traﬃc sensors. Here, we assume the partial
information is obtained from the probe vehicles and has
a limited coverage, e.g. 5%. The speed ﬁeld samples re-
quired for training the neural network model are generated
using traﬃc simulation.

The learning model used in this study is a Deep Con-
volutional Neural Network (Deep CNN) stacked into an
encoder-decoder architecture. Deep CNN models have

properties favorable for learning the space-time correla-
tions between traﬃc speeds [2]. The architecture of the
Deep CNN model is further modiﬁed to explicitly capture
the directions of traﬃc causality over the space-time plane.
In the experiments, we show high-resolution traﬃc speed
ﬁelds estimated for several real freeway segments and other
traﬃc variables that can be inferred from these estimated
speed maps. This general learning framework can address
a broad class of related traﬃc problems − state estima-
tion, data imputation and prediction; we limit our focus
to traﬃc state estimation.

2 Related Works

Existing approaches for traﬃc estimation are broadly clas-
siﬁed into 1) model-based data assimilation techniques, 2)
data-driven statistical methods, and 3) structured learning
methods. The ﬁrst approach combines the predictions of
a traﬃc ﬂow model with real-time traﬃc observations us-
ing an exogenous ﬁlter, and is the most popular in practice
[5, 15, 27, 31]. These techniques honor basic traﬃc physics
and are more robust to outliers. However, these methods
are restricted by the representational power of the selected
traﬃc ﬂow model, and require additional inputs such as
initial and boundary conditions and traﬃc ﬂow model pa-
rameters. Furthermore, their estimations are often coarse
grained, i.e., most studies assume an estimation interval
of 100 − 500 m × 5 − 15 minutes (with an exception of a
few recent studies [13]) and are not suitable for arbitrary
space-time resolutions. The latter is a drawback of the
numerical scheme used in solving the traﬃc ﬂow model;
for e.g., in the Eulerian coordinate system, the mesh sizes
in the space and time dimensions are restricted by the
Courant-Fredich-Lewy (CFL) condition [20].

Data-driven methods use large amounts of historical
traﬃc data to synthesize patterns and use them for fu-
ture predictions. These methods don’t utilize any traﬃc
domain knowledge. The popular choices for learning algo-
rithms include Deep Neural Networks [2, 16, 25], Support
Vector Machines [26] and ARIMA [10]. They have been
shown to perform better than model-based approaches in
capturing the daily and weekly traﬃc ﬂow pattern, but
their practicalilty is limited by their large data require-
ments, lack of robustness and poor interpretability. More
recently, structured machine learning techniques have been
proposed to improve the data-driven methods by incorpo-
rating traﬃc domain knowledge into the learning frame-
work [4, 6, 7, 14, 28, 32]. In deep learning, this is often
done by adding a regularizer. For e.g., [4, 14] used the
LWR macroscopic ﬂow model, and [32] used the integral
form of the vehicle conservation law as the cost function

regularizer. The reported beneﬁts include feasible and ro-
bust estimation along with lower data requirements. How-
ever, only macroscopic traﬃc ﬂow models are amenable to
such integration, which again limit their representational
capacity.

The visualization-based learning method outlined in this
paper overcomes some of the limitations mentioned above.
First, our approach allows the speed ﬁeld to be quanti-
ﬁed with a ﬁne mesh size and an arbitrary space-time
resolution. This is beneﬁcial if one requires speed ﬁelds
for smaller road sections but at longer time intervals or
vice-versa. Second, the estimation method does not as-
it is
sume knowledge of initial or boundary conditions;
able to produce an estimate for any given input speed ﬁeld
at low computational cost (approximately the cost associ-
ated with a single forward pass of the Deep CNN model).
Third, learning the dynamics over interpretable visualiza-
tions allow to easily incorporate domain knowledge to the
learning model, e.g., causality (the anisotropy of traﬃc
ﬂow). Finally, using simulated data as a surrogate to real
data is an implicit way of incorporating complex traﬃc
behaviors (obtained from the traﬃc ﬂow models used in
the simulation) into the learning model.

3 Learning Model

3.1 Problem Setting

The macroscopic speed ﬁeld is deﬁned over a space-time
plane of dimension |X|×|T |, where X and T are the sets of
discretizations in space and time coordinates, respectively.
The complete macroscopic speed ﬁeld is denoted by vf ∈
[0, Vmax]|X|×|T | where Vmax is the maximum traﬃc speed;
this is the output of the learning model. The input to the
model is the partially ﬁlled speed ﬁeld vp. A sample pair
of input and output speed ﬁelds for a road section is shown
in Fig. 1.

FIGURE 1: Input speed ﬁeld vp and output speed ﬁeld vf .

Page 2

0204060Time[s]8006004002000Space[m](a) Input0204060Time[s](b) Output050100V[kmph]An immediate challenge here is the representation of
input speed ﬁeld vp. Since the traﬃc speed is a scalar
variable, a matrix representation of the input speed ﬁeld
vp cannot distinguish between cells with zero traﬃc speed
(i.e. congested cells) and cells with missing information
about the traﬃc speed. A more natural way to represent
the input speed ﬁeld is in the form of a three dimensional
RGB (Red-Green-Blue) array as opposed to an array of
single dimension speed values. For e.g., with reference to
Fig. 1, the RGB representation of a missing cell is (0, 0, 0)
and that of congested cell is (255, 0, 0). Thus, the input
speed ﬁeld is vp ∈ [0, 1]|X|×|T |×3, where the RGB values
are normalized between 0 and 1.

The learning problem aims to approximate a non-linear
operator G that maps the input speed ﬁeld to the output
speed ﬁeld, i.e., G : vp → vf .

3.2 Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model

The mapping operator G is approximated using an
encoder-decoder neural network architecture as shown in
Fig. 2. The encoder and decoder models are each com-
posed of a sequence of Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) layers. The encoder model takes in the input speed
ﬁeld vp and produces a higher dimensional hidden repre-
sentation, which is then decoded by the decoder model to
form the output speed ﬁeld vf . As depicted in Fig. 2,
the hidden representation extracts the essential spatio-
temporal traﬃc information from the sparse input speed
ﬁeld vp.

road section length and time period.

3.3 Anisotropic Deep CNN Model

We further modify the architecture of the Deep CNN
model to explicitly capture the asymmetric direction of
causality in traﬃc. Convolutional operators in CNNs treat
information coming from all directions equally. This is de-
picted in Fig. 3(a), where the traﬃc speed at (x, t) has a
space-time correlation deﬁned by Iiso. This implies that
a variation in the traﬃc speed at (x, t) can propagate at
inﬁnite velocity.

FIGURE 3: Anisotropic CNN kernel capturing traﬃc causality.
Vmax is the maximum traﬃc speed and Vcong is the backward
shockwave speed.

In traﬃc, variations at (x, t) only propagate at ﬁnite ve-
locities. Moreover, these propagation velocities depend on
the traﬃc state at (x, t), i.e. whether it is in free-ﬂow or is
congested [19, 21, 24]. The former property is called hy-
perbolicity and the latter is called anisotropy. In free-ﬂow
traﬃc, speed variations propagate in the direction of traf-
ﬁc ﬂow whereas in the congested traﬃc, speed variations
propagate in the opposite direction of traﬃc ﬂow. The
anisotropic property is speciﬁc to traﬃc ﬂow, and is due
to drivers reacting more to leading vehicles than to follow-
ing vehicles. The resulting space-time correlations are Ifree
and Icong, as depicted in Figs. 3(b) and (c). We modify
the isotropic kernel of the Deep CNN model to reﬂect this.

FIGURE 2: Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

The Deep CNN model has speciﬁc properties that make
it suitable for learning traﬃc dynamics. Traﬃc speed at
a point (x, t) in the space-time plane only depends on the
traﬃc conditions in its immediate neighborhood. Sparse
connectivity of the CNN model ensures this by having lo-
cal neuron connections, with local being deﬁned as the
CNN kernel size. The parameter sharing property of the
CNN model implies that the learned traﬃc features can
occur anywhere over the space-time plane, i.e, they are
space-time invariant. As a result, the Deep CNN model
is independent of |X| and |T |, and can be applied to any

3.4 Simulated Data and Training

The data required for training the anisotropic Deep CNN
model is generated using the Vissim traﬃc microsimula-
tor [3]. We simulate a real multi-lane freeway segment
with three levels of traﬃc demand inputs − free-ﬂow, slow-
moving and congested traﬃc. The simulation model is
calibrated to replicate the corresponding real driving con-
ditions. The simulation is run for 2 hours for each scenario,
and vehicle trajectory data is recorded. The macroscopic
traﬃc speed ﬁeld is then calculated from the vehicle trajec-
tory data. The input-output training sample pairs are then

training samples.

We use the TensorFlow framework [1] to train our
anisotropic Deep CNN. The encoder and decoder models
each consist of three CNN layers. After calibration, the
kernel conﬁguration of the model is: (5 × 5 × 40), (7 × 7 ×
48), (7 × 7 × 32), (5 × 5 × 48), (5 × 5 × 40), (9 × 9 × 56) and
(7 × 7 × 1). We train the model using stochastic gradi-
ent optimization with a mean squared error loss function.
Note that the training procedure is carried out oﬄine.

4 Results and Discussion

4.1 Speed Field Reconstruction

We evaluate the performance of the anisotropic Deep CNN
model using real freeway data obtained from the Next Gen-
eration Simulation program (NGSIM) dataset [22] and the
German Highway (HighD) dataset [8]. A few sample es-
timated speed ﬁelds under diﬀerent traﬃc conditions are
shown in Figs. 4 through 6. For all estimations, the mesh
size is 10m × 1s, and the probe coverage is 5%. The in-
put probe vehicle trajectories are shown as black dotted
curves.

FIGURE 6: Speed ﬁeld estimation in heavily congested traﬃc (US-
101 highway lane 3 of the NGSIM dataset). The RMSE is 12.7

A preliminary observation of the reconstructed speed
ﬁelds shows that they are indeed similar to the true speed
ﬁelds despite the limited coverage of the probe vehicles.
The traﬃc dynamics they produce look feasible by ob-
servation, and the existence of diﬀerent traﬃc states in

diﬀerent parts of the time-space plane is captured with
reasonable accuracy.

Fig. 4 shows that free-ﬂow traﬃc is estimated well by
the Deep CNN. The turquoise bands representing rela-
tively slower free-ﬂow traﬃc are reconstructed accurately

However, given
the low rate of probe coverage among the already sparse
vehicles present in free-ﬂow traﬃc, there are large areas
of the space-time plane without coverage. In these areas,
the model interpolates from the closest probe trajectories
while assuming that there are no slowdowns in the uncov-
ered area. This is a reasonable conclusion in the absence
of any information, but it leads to the estimated speed be-
ing higher than the real speed when there are unobserved
slower moving vehicles present (see the area around 600s).
The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the estimation
is quite high at 14.60 kmph, but the relative RMSE is only
8.80%, which implies that the estimation is accurate and
acceptable.

Fig. 5 shows an example of slow-moving traﬃc with
backward propagating waves. The existence and extent
of these waves is closely replicated by the model. For ex-
ample, the shockwaves in the ﬁrst 300s of the true speed
ﬁeld dissipate around 250m, whereas later shockwaves do
not dissipate. Both of these phenomena can also be seen in
the estimated speed ﬁeld. In slow-moving traﬃc, vehicles
interact with each other more frequently, and the collective
dynamics can be inferred eﬀectively from the trajectories
of a few vehicles. Coupled with the eﬀect of having better
coverage due to the increased density of vehicles, this leads
to the RMSE of slow-moving traﬃc being low (around 7−9
kmph).

Fig. 6 shows an example where the model does not re-
construct the dynamics very accurately. The true speed
ﬁeld shows heavy congestion, with vehicles moving at very
low speeds for long periods. The estimated speed ﬁeld
does show the congestion, but with more prominent waves
and slightly higher speeds. This is because the speed dis-
tribution in this real traﬃc sample is very diﬀerent from
the speed distribution in our simulated training set; the
model has not seen such consistently-slow-moving traﬃc
while training. Whenever a probe trajectory crosses a
slightly faster moving region, the model extrapolates the
speed ﬁeld in the vicinity to be similarly faster, whereas it
is not usually the case. This can be seen at several points
in time near the beginning of the road segment (0 − 50m).
However, even under this unfamiliar scenario, the recon-
struction is reasonable, and the RMSE is not very high.
Note that this is an extreme case shown for illustration;
in typical examples of congested traﬃc, where the dynam-
ics are not this drastically diﬀerent from those observed in
training, the model performs better (RMSE around 8 − 10
kmph).

4.2 Trajectory Inference

The estimated speed ﬁeld can also be used to infer the tra-
jectories of all the vehicles. This is done by taking the en-
try time of each vehicle (which is an additional input that
can be determined from a stationary traﬃc sensor) and
then tracing its position through the speed ﬁeld. Figs. 7
and 8 show the true and inferred trajectories correspond-
ing to a free-ﬂow and congested scenario respectively; there
is good agreement in both cases. Furthermore, the in-
ferred trajectories do not overlap, implying that the esti-
mation does not produce physically infeasible traﬃc pat-
terns. The inferred trajectories are smooth versions of the
actual trajectories (compare the stop-and-go behavior in
Figs. 8(a) and (b)). These observations demonstrate that
the anisotropic Deep CNN model learned to produce traf-
ﬁc speed ﬁelds that honor basic traﬃc physics without ex-
plicitly imposing any physical constraints. One can further
use these inferred trajectories to estimate other traﬃc vari-
ables such as density and headways.

FIGURE 7: Vehicle trajectories inferred from part of the estimated
speed ﬁeld of free-ﬂow traﬃc in Fig. 4.

4.3 Hidden Representation

In order to demonstrate that our model has learned to dis-
tinguish between diﬀerent traﬃc states, we visualize the in-
formation it extracts from its input. We project the hidden
representation of 3000 unseen input speed ﬁeld samples

Learning traﬃc speed dynamics from visualizations

We notice that the congested traﬃc samples form an
isolated cluster, while there is some overlap among the
free-ﬂow and slow-moving traﬃc samples. These clusters
become more distinct with higher probe coverage. The
presence of these well-deﬁned clusters in the hidden repre-
sentation shows that the deep neural network model can
infer the traﬃc state from the available input observations
and produces traﬃc waves accordingly; it does not require
any additional inputs. In other words, a neural network
model can solve the under-determined estimation problem
− a major beneﬁt compared to other machine learning
tools. The other beneﬁts highlighted in this study, such as
eliminating the dependence on initial or boundary condi-
tions, the high resolution of the estimation, and the sparse
observation setting, are also partly enabled by use of a
deep neural network model as the function approximator.

5 Conclusion

In this study, we present a deep learning method to esti-
mate road traﬃc dynamics from space-time diagrams of
macroscopic traﬃc speed ﬁelds. The space-time visualiza-
tions of traﬃc variables such as speed or density reﬂect
diﬀerent features of traﬃc conditions, such as stop-and-
go waves, congested parts of the road, and the extent of
queued vehicles. Our objective is to exploit these inter-
pretable visualizations to learn the underlying traﬃc dy-
namics while being agnostic to external factors such as
traﬃc demand, road geometry, and weather conditions.
We demonstrate this within the framework of traﬃc state
estimation and highlight the key beneﬁts it can achieve
over traditional estimation techniques.

Our speed estimation model is a Deep Convolutional
Neural Network (Deep CNN) that uses only sparse probe
vehicle trajectory observations to reconstruct the speed
ﬁeld over a given discretized space-time plane with ﬁne
resolution. The CNN uses an anisotropic kernel which is
designed to incorporate traﬃc causality by capturing in-
formation from only the relevant directions in free-ﬂow and
congested traﬃc. We train the model using simulated traf-
ﬁc data under various demand conditions, in order to im-
plicitly incorporate the dynamics of the traﬃc ﬂow model
used in the simulation. We test the model using real data
from multiple datasets with varied traﬃc characteristics.
Our results show that the anisotropic Deep CNN performs
well in terms of estimation error, given the sparsity of the
probe coverage and the sometimes unfamiliar characteris-
tics of real traﬃc.
In particular, the reconstructed traf-
ﬁc dynamics are plausible and do not violate basic traﬃc
physics principles. We further show how to use the esti-
mated speed ﬁeld to infer the trajectories of all vehicles.

point corresponds to a single input speed ﬁeld. The two-
dimensional scatter points are then color coded with their
respective traﬃc state − free-ﬂow, slow-moving or con-
gested.

sualization has signiﬁcant beneﬁts for traﬃc engineering
applications. It allows us to easily integrate heterogeneous
traﬃc data sources as input to the model. For instance,
dynamic features such as weather condition, road visibil-
ity, and temporary road inhomogeneities (lane closures or
variable speed limits) can be visualized over a space-time
diagram and be used as inputs to the learning model. This
application can also be extended to interrupted traﬃc fa-
cilities like urban arterial, where we can represent the sig-
nal timing as a horizontal speed band in the space-time
diagram. Furthermore, the computational requirement for
producing a high-resolution estimate is relatively low when
working in the image space compared to the raw represen-
tation of speeds and positions of all vehicles on the road.
Lastly, the use of deep learning tools, which are universal
function approximators, can overcome the curse of dimen-
sionality problems arising in traﬃc engineering applica-
tions.
