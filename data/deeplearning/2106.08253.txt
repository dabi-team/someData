ABSTRACT
Automated Program Repair (APR) helps improve the efficiency of
software development and maintenance. Recent APR techniques
use deep learning, particularly the encoder-decoder architecture,
to generate patches. Though existing DL-based APR approaches
have proposed different encoder architectures, the decoder remains
to be the standard one, which generates a sequence of tokens one
by one to replace the faulty statement. This decoder has multiple
limitations: 1) allowing to generate syntactically incorrect programs,
2) inefficiently representing small edits, and 3) not being able to
generate project-specific identifiers.

In this paper, we propose Recoder, a syntax-guided edit decoder
with placeholder generation. Recoder is novel in multiple aspects:
1) Recoder generates edits rather than modified code, allowing
efficient representation of small edits; 2) Recoder is syntax-guided,
with the novel provider/decider architecture to ensure the syntactic
correctness of the patched program and accurate generation; 3)
Recoder generates placeholders that could be instantiated as project-
specific identifiers later.

We conduct experiments to evaluate Recoder on 395 bugs from
Defects4J v1.2, 420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, 297 bugs
from IntroClassJava and 40 bugs from QuixBugs. Our results show
that Recoder repairs 51 bugs on Defects4J v1.2, which achieves

21.4% (9 bugs) improvement over the previous state-of-the-art ap-
proach for single-hunk bugs (TBar). Importantly, to our knowledge,
Recoder is the first DL-based APR approach that has outperformed
the traditional APR approaches on this benchmark. Furthermore, Re-
coder repairs 19 bugs on the additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0,
which is 137.5% (11 bugs) more than TBar and 850% (17 bugs) more
than SimFix. Recoder also achieves 775% (31 bugs) and 30.8% (4
bugs) improvement on IntroClassJava and QuixBugs over the base-
lines respectively. These results suggest that Recoder has better
generalizability than existing APR approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION
Automated program repair (APR) aims to reduce bug-fixing effort
by generating patches to aid the developers. Due to the well-known
problem of weak test suites [55], even if a patch passes all the
tests, the patch still has a high probability of being incorrect. To
overcome this problem, existing approaches have used different
means to guide the patch generation. A typical way is to learn
from existing software repositories, such as learning patterns from
existing patches [2, 23, 24, 28, 40, 42, 58], and using program code
to guide the patch generation [24, 43, 60, 71, 72].

Deep learning is known as a powerful machine learning ap-
proach. Recently, a series of research efforts have attempted to use
deep learning (DL) techniques to learn from existing patches for
program repair [8, 19, 36, 66]. A typical DL-based approach gen-
erates a new statement to replace the faulty statement located by
a fault localization approach. Existing DL-based approaches are
based on the encoder-decoder architecture [3]: the encoder encodes
the faulty statement as well as any necessary code context into a
fixed-length internal representation, and the decoder generates a
new statement from it. For example, Hata et al. [19] and Tufano
et al. [66] adopt an existing neural machine translation architecture,
NMT, to generate the bug fix; SequenceR [8] uses a sequence-to-
sequence neural model with a copy mechanism; DLFix [36] further
treats the faulty statement as an AST rather than a sequence of
tokens, and encodes the context of the statement.

However, despite multiple existing efforts, DL-based APR ap-
proaches have not yet outperformed traditional APR approaches.
Since deep learning has outperformed traditional approaches in
many domains, in this paper we aim to further improve the perfor-
mance of DL-based APR to understand whether we could outper-
form traditional APR using a DL-based approach. We observe that,
though existing DL-based APR approaches have proposed different
encoder architectures for APR, the decoder architecture remains to
be the standard one, generating a sequence of tokens one by one
to replace the original faulty program fragment. The use of this
standard decoder significantly limits the performance of DL-based
APR. Here we highlight three main limitations.

Limitation 1: Including syntactically incorrect programs
in the patch space. The goal of the decoder is to locate a patch
from a patch space. The smaller the patch space is, the easier the task
is. However, viewing a patch as a sequence of tokens unnecessarily
enlarges the patch space, making the decoding task difficult. In
particular, this space representation does not consider the syntax of
the target programming language and includes many syntactically
incorrect statements, which can never form a correct patch.

Limitation 2: Inefficient representation of small edits. Many
patches only modify a small portion of a statement, and re-generating
the whole statement leads to an unnecessarily large patch space.
For example, let us consider the patch of defect Closure-14 in the
Defects4J benchmark [26], as shown in Figure 1. This patch only
changes one token in the statement, but under existing representa-
tion, it is encoded as a sequence of length 13. The program space
containing this patch would roughly contain 𝑛13 elements, where
𝑛 is the total number of tokens. On the other hand, let us consider
a patch space including only one-token change edits. To generate
that patch, only selecting a token in the faulty statement and a new
token for replacement is needed. This patch space contains only 𝑚𝑛
elements, where 𝑚 is the number of tokens in the faulty statement.
Therefore, the size of the patch space is significantly reduced.

Limitation 3: Not being able to generate project-specific
identifiers. Source code of programs often contains project-specific
identifiers like variable names. Since it is impractical to include
all possible identifiers in the patch space, existing DL-based APR
approaches only generate identifiers that have frequently appeared
in the training set. However, different projects have different sets
of project-specific identifiers, and therefore only considering iden-
tifiers in the training set may exclude possible patches from the

Figure 1: The Patch for Closure-14 in Defects4J

Figure 2: The Patch for Lang-57 in Defects4J

patch space. For example, Figure 2 shows the patch for defect Lang-
57 in Defects4J. To generate this patch, we need to generate the
identifier “availableLocaleSet”, which is a method name of the
faulty class, and is unlikely to be included in the training set. As a
result, existing DL-based approaches cannot generate patches like
this.

In this paper, we propose a novel DL-based APR approach, Re-
coder, standing for repair decoder. Similar to existing approaches,
Recoder is based on the encoder-decoder architecture. To address
the limitations above, the decoder of Recoder has following two
novel techniques.

Novelty 1: Syntax-Guided Edit Decoding with Provider/De-
cider Architecture (concerning limitation 1 & 2). To address limi-
tation 2, the decoder component of Recoder produces a sequence of
edits rather than a new statement. Our edit decoder is based on the
idea of the syntax-guided decoder in existing neural program gener-
ation approaches [56, 63, 64, 75]. For an unexpanded non-terminal
node in a partial AST, the decoder estimates the probability of each
grammar rule to be used to expand the node. Based on this, the
decoder selects the most probable sequence of rules to expand the
start symbol into a full program using a search algorithm such as
beam search. We observe that edits could also be described by a
grammar. For example, the previous patch for defect Closure-14
could be described by the following grammar:

Edit → Insert | Modify | . . .
Modify → modify(NodeID, NTS)
Here modify represents replacing an AST subtree denoted by its
root node ID (NodeID) in the faulty statement with a newly gener-
ated subtree (NTS1).

However, directly applying the existing syntax-guided decoder
to the grammar above would not form an effective program repair
approach, because the choice of expanding different non-terminal
nodes may need to be deduced along with different types of de-
pendencies. First, the expansion of some non-terminals depends on
the local context, e.g., the choice of NodeID depends on the faulty
statement, and the neural network needs to be aware of the local
context to make a suitable choice. Second, to guarantee syntax
correctness (limitation 1), dependency exists among the choices
for expanding different non-terminal nodes, e.g., when NodeID ex-
pands to an ID pointing to a node with non-terminal JavaExpr, NTS
should also expand to JavaExpr to ensure syntactic correctness.
These choices cannot be effectively pre-defined, and thus the ex-
isting syntax-guided decoders, which only select among a set of
pre-defined grammar rules, do not work here.

1“NTS” stands for “non-terminal symbol in an AST”.

ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece

To train the neural network to generate placeholders, we re-
place infrequent user-defined identifiers in the training set with
placeholders. In this way, the neural network learns to generate
placeholders for these identifiers.

Our experiment is conducted on four benchmarks: (1) 395 bugs
from Defects4J v1.2 for comparison with existing approaches. (2)
420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, (3) 297 bugs from Intro-
ClassJava, and (4) 40 bugs from QuixBugs to evaluate the generaliz-
ability of Recoder. The results show that Recoder correctly repairs
53 bugs on the first benchmark, which are 26.2% (11 bugs) more
than TBar [40] and 55.9% (19 bugs) more than SimFix [24], two
best-performing single-hunk APR approaches on Defects4J v1.2;
Recoder also correctly repairs 19 bugs on the second benchmark,
which are 137.5% (11 bugs) more than TBar and 850.0% (17 bugs)
more than SimFix . On IntroClassJava and QuixBugs, Recoder re-
pairs 35 bugs and 17 bugs respectively, which also achieves better
performance than the existing APR tools that were evaluated on
the two benchmarks. The results suggest that Recoder has better
performance and better generalizability than existing approaches.
To our knowledge, this is the first DL-based APR approach that has
outperformed traditional APR approaches. To summarize, this paper
makes the following contributions:

• We propose a syntax-guided edit decoder for APR with a
provider/decider architecture to accurately predict the ed-
its and ensure that the edited program is syntactically cor-
rect and uses placeholders to generate patches with project-
specific identifiers.

• We design Recoder, a neural APR approach based on the

decoder architecture described above.

• We evaluate Recoder on 395 bugs from Defects4J v1.2 and 420
additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0. The results show that Re-
coder significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
for single-hunk bugs in terms of both repair performance
and generalizability.

2 EDITS
We introduce the syntax and semantics of edits and their relations
to providers in this section. The neural architecture to generate
edits and implement providers will be discussed in the next section.

2.1 Syntax and Semantics of Edits
Figure 4 shows the syntax of edits. Note that our approach is not
specific to a particular programming language and can be applied
to any programming language (called the host language) that has a
concept similar to the statement. In particular, it is required that
when a statement is present in a program, a sequence of statements
can also be present at the same location. In other words, inserting
a statement before any existing statement would still result in a
syntactically correct program. To ensure syntactic correctness of
the edited program, the syntax of edits depends on the syntax of
the host language. In Figure 4, “HL” refers to the host programming
language our approach applies to. In the following we explain each
rule in Figure 4 in order.

As defined by Rule 1 and Rule 2, an Edits is a sequence of Edit
ended by a special symbol end. An Edit can be one of two edit
operations, insert and modify.

Figure 3: Provider/Decider Architecture

To overcome these problems, Recoder introduces a provider/de-
cider architecture, as shown in Figure 3. A provider is a neural
component that provides a set of choices for expanding a non-
terminal and estimates the probability 𝑝𝑖 of each choice. A basic
provider is the rule predictor, which, similar to existing syntax-
guided decoders, estimates the probability of each grammar rule
to expand the node. Fixing the Closure-14 example needs another
provider, namely the subtree locator, which estimates the probabil-
ity of each subtree in the faulty statement to be replaced. On the
other hand, the decider is a component that estimates the proba-
bility of 𝑞 𝑗 using each provider. In this example, when expanding
Edit, the probability of using the rule predictor is 1, and the proba-
bility of using the subtree locator is 0; when expanding Modify, the
probability of using the rule predictor is 0 and the probability of
using the subtree locator is 1 (the located subtree decides both the
content of NodeID and the root symbol of NTS). Finally, the choices
provided by all providers form the final list of choices, while the
probability of each choice is the product of the probability predicted
by its provider and the probability of the provider itself, i.e., 𝑝𝑖 ∗ 𝑞 𝑗 .
In this example, for each non-terminal, we use the choices from
only one provider, and thus the probabilities of providers are either
0 or 1. Later we will see that expanding some non-terminals requires
comparing the choices of multiple providers, and the probabilities
of providers could be a real number between 0 and 1.

Novelty 2: Placeholder Generation (concerning limitation
3). To generate project-specific identifiers, a direct idea is to add
another provider that selects an identifier from the local context.
However, to implement such a provider, the neural component
needs to access all of the name declarations within the current
project. This is a difficult job, as the neural component could hardly
encode all source code from the whole project.

Instead of relying on the neural network to generate project-
specific identifiers, in Recoder the neural network generates place-
holders for such identifiers, and these placeholders are instantiated
with all feasible identifiers when applying the edits. A feasible
identifier is an identifier compatible with constraints in the pro-
gramming language, such as the type system. As for defect Lang-
57 shown in Figure 2, Recoder first generates a placeholder for
“availableLocaleSet”, and it will be replaced with all methods ac-
cessible in the local context that takes no arguments and returns an
object with a member method “contains”. Each replacement forms
a new patch. The key insight is that, when considering constraints
in the programming language, the number of choices for replacing
a placeholder with an identifier is small, and thus instantiating the
placeholders with all possible choices is feasible.

language representing an identifier.

Figure 4: The Syntax of Edits

Rule 3 defines the syntax of insert operation. The insert op-
eration inserts a newly generated statement before the faulty state-
ment. As shown in Rule 3, the insert operation has one parameter,
which is the statement to insert. Here ⟨𝐻𝐿𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡⟩ refers to the
non-terminal in the grammar of the host language that represents
a statement. This non-terminal could be expanded into a full state-
ment, or a copy operation that copies a statement from the original
program, or a mixture of both. This behavior will be explained later
in Rule 5.

Rule 4 defines the syntax of modify operation. The modify op-
eration replaces an AST subtree in the faulty statement with a new
AST subtree. The modify operation has two parameters. The first
parameter is the ID of the root node from the AST subtree to be
replaced. The ID of a node is defined as the order of a node in the
pre-order traversal sequence, e.g., the 6th visited node has the ID of
6. The second parameter is an AST subtree whose root node has the
same symbol, i.e., the root node cannot be changed. In this way, the
replacement ensures syntactic correctness. To ensure that there is
an actual change, the subtree to be replaced should have more than
one node, i.e., the root node should have a non-terminal symbol.
For both insert and modify, we need to generate a new AST
subtree. It is noticeable that in many patches, the AST subtree being
inserted or modified is not completely original; some of its subtrees
may be copied from other parts of the program. Taking advantage
of this property, copy operation is introduced to further reduce the
patch space. Rule 5 defines the syntax of this operation. It is a meta-
rule applied to any non-terminal symbol of the host language. For
any non-terminal symbol in the host language, we add a production
rule that expands it into a copy operation. The original production
rules for this non-terminal are also kept, so that when generating
the edits, the neural network could choose to directly generate a
new subtree or to copy one.

The copy operation has one parameter, which identifies the root
node of the AST subtree to be copied. The AST subtree can be
selected from the faulty statement or its context. In our current
implementation, we allow copying from the method surrounding
the faulty statement. Also, to ensure syntactic correctness, the root

Figure 5: Example of Insert Operation (Closure-2)

node of the subtree to be copied should have the same non-terminal
symbol as the symbol being extended.

Finally, Rule 6 introduces placeholder into the grammar. Nor-
mally, the grammar of a programming language uses a terminal
symbol to represent an identifier. To enable the neural network
to generate concrete identifiers as well as the placeholder, we
change identifier nodes into non-terminals, which expand to either
placeholder or one of the frequent identifiers in the training set.
In our current implementation, an identifier is considered frequent
if it appears more than 100 times in the training set.

When applying the edits, the placeholder tokens are replaced
with feasible identifiers within the context. We first collect all iden-
tifiers in the current projects by performing a lexical analysis and
collect the tokens whose lexical type is ⟨HLIdentifier⟩, the sym-
bol representing an identifier in the host language. Then we filter
identifiers based on the following criteria: (1) the identifier is ac-
cessible from the local context, and (2) replacing the placeholder
with the identifier would not lead to type errors. The remaining
identifiers are feasible identifiers.

Figure 5 and Figure 6 show two example patches represented by
edits. The patch in Figure 5 inserts an if statement, and the condi-
tional expression contains a method invocation that is copied from
the faulty statement. The patch in Figure 6 replaces the qualifier of
a method invocation with another invocation, where the name of
the method is a placeholder to be instantiated later.

Theorem 2.1. The edited programs are syntactically correct.

Proof. It is easy to see that the theorem holds by structural
induction on the grammar of the edits. First, the requirement on
the host programming language ensures that inserting a statement
before another statement is syntactical correct. Second, when re-
placing a subtree with modify, the root symbol of the subtree re-
mains unchanged. Third, the new subtree in insert and modify
is generated by either using the grammar rules of the host lan-
guage, or copying a subtree with the same root symbol. Finally,
instantiating a placeholder ensures syntactic correctness because
we only replace a placeholder with a token whose lexical type is

⟨HLIdentifier⟩.

for the current non-terminal symbol. For example, if the symbol
being expanded is Modify, the decider resets the probability of rule
predictor and tree copier to zero.

3 MODEL ARCHITECTURE
The design of our model is based on the state-of-the-art syntax-
guided code generation model, TreeGen [64]. It is a tree-based
Transformer [67] that takes a natural language description as input
and produces a program as output. Since our approach takes a faulty
statement and its context as input and produces edits as output, we
replace the components in TreeGen for encoding natural language
description and decoding the program.

Figure 7 shows an overview of our model. The model performs
one step in the edit generation process, which is to predict proba-
bilities of choices for expanding a non-terminal node. Beam search
is used to find the best combination of choices for generating the
complete edits. The model consists of four main components:

• The code reader that encodes the faulty statement and its

context.

• The AST reader that encodes the partial AST of the edits

that have been generated.

• The tree path reader that encodes a path from the root
node to a non-terminal node which should be expanded.
• The edit decoder that takes the encoded information from
the previous three components and produces a probability
of each choice for expanding the non-terminal node.

Among them, the AST reader and the tree path reader are derived
from TreeGen, where the code reader and the edit decoder are newly
introduced in this paper. In this section, we focus on describing the
latter two components in detail.

3.1 Code Reader
The code reader component encodes the faulty statement and the
method surrounding the faulty statement as its context, where the
faulty statement is localized by a fault localization technique. It
uses the following three inputs. (1) AST traversal sequence. This
is a sequence of tokens following the pre-order traversal of the
AST, 𝒄1, 𝒄2, · · · , 𝒄𝐿, where 𝒄𝑖 is the token encoding vector of the
𝑖th node embedded via word embedding [49]. (2) Tag embedding.
This is a sequence of tags following the same pre-order traversal of
the AST, where each tag denotes which of the following cases the
corresponding node belongs to: 1. in the faulty statement, 2. in the
statement before the faulty statement, 3. in the statement after the
faulty statement, or 4. in other statements. Each tag is embedded
via an embedding-lookup table. We denote the tag embedding as
𝒕1, 𝒕2, · · · , 𝒕𝐿. (3) AST-based Graph. Considering that the former
two inputs do not capture the neighbor relations between AST
nodes, in order to capture such information, we treat an AST as a
directional graph where the nodes are AST nodes and the edges
link a node to each of its children and its left sibling, as shown in
Figure 8(b). This graph is embedded as an adjacent matrix.

The code reader uses three sub-layers to encode the three inputs

above, as discussed in the following sections.

Self-Attention. The self-attention sub-layer encodes the AST
3.1.1
traversal sequence, following the Transformer [67] architecture to
capture the long dependency information in the AST.

2.2 Generation of Edits
Since the choice of expanding a non-terminal may depend on the
local context or a previous choice, we use providers to provide
choices and estimate their probabilities. Our current implementa-
tion has three types of providers. Table 1 shows these providers
and their associated non-terminals.

For non-terminals Edits, Edit, Insert and ⟨HLIdentifier⟩, the rule
predictor is responsible for providing choices and estimates the
probability of each production rule. The rule predictor consists
of a neural component and a logic component. After the neural
component assigns the probability for each production rule, the
logic component resets the probability of rules whose left-hand
side is not the corresponding non-terminal to zero and normalizes
the remaining probabilities.

For Modify, the subtree locator is responsible for providing the
choices. The subtree locator estimates the probability of each AST
subtree with a size larger than 1 in the faulty statement. The choice
of a subtree 𝑡 means that we should expand Modify into modify(ID,
NTS) where ID is the root ID of 𝑡 and NTS is the root symbol of 𝑡.
For any non-terminal in the grammar of the host language (note
that ⟨HLIdentifier⟩ is a terminal symbol in the host language), both
the rule predictor and the tree copier are responsible to provide
the choices. The tree copier estimates the probabilities of each AST
subtree with a size larger than 1 in the method surrounding the
faulty statement. The choice of a subtree 𝑡 means that we should
expand the non-terminal into copy(ID), where ID is the root ID
of 𝑡. Similar to the rule predictor, the tree copier employs a logic
component after the neural component to reset the probabilities of
subtrees whose root symbols are different from the non-terminal
symbol being expanded.

Finally, the decider assigns a probability to each provider. The
decider also includes a similar logic component, which resets the
probability of a provider to zero if that provider is not responsible

Figure 7: Overview of Recoder

Given the embedding of the input AST traversal sequence, we
use position embedding to represent positional information of the
AST token. The input vectors are denoted as 𝒄1, 𝒄2, · · · , 𝒄𝐿, and the
position embedding of 𝑖th token is computed as

𝑝 (𝑖,2𝑗) = sin(𝑝𝑜𝑠/(100002𝑗/𝑑 ))
𝑝 (𝑖,2𝑗+1) = cos(𝑝𝑜𝑠/(100002𝑗/𝑑 ))
where 𝑝𝑜𝑠 = 𝑖 + 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝, 𝑗 denotes the element of the input vector
and 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 denotes the embedding size. After we get the vector of
each position, it is directly added to the corresponding input vector,
where 𝒆𝑖 = 𝒄𝑖 + 𝒑𝑖 .

Then, we adopt multi-head attention layer to capture non-linear
features. Following the definition of Vaswani et al. [67], we divide
the attention mechanism into 𝐻 heads. Each head represents an
individual attention layer to extract unique information. The single
attention layer maps the query 𝑄, the key 𝐾, and the value 𝑉 into
a weighted-sum output. The computation of the 𝑗th head layer can
be represented as

𝑄𝐾𝑇
√︁𝑑𝑘

ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 𝑗 = softmax(

)𝑉

(3)

where 𝑑𝑘 = 𝑑/𝐻 denotes the length of each extracted feature vector,
and 𝑄, 𝐾 and 𝑉 are computed by a fully-connected layer from 𝑄,
𝐾, 𝑉 . In the encoder, vectors 𝑄, 𝐾 and 𝑉 are all the outputs of the
position embedding layer 𝒆1, 𝒆2, · · · , 𝒆𝐿. The outputs of these heads
are further joint together with a fully-connected layer, which is
computed by

(4)
𝑂𝑢𝑡 = [ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑1; · · · ; ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝐻 ] · 𝑊ℎ
where 𝑊ℎ denotes the weight of the fully-connected layer and 𝑂𝑢𝑡
denotes the outputs 𝒂1, 𝒂2, · · · , 𝒂𝑳 of the self-attention sub-layer.
3.1.2 Gating Layer. This sub-layer takes the outputs of the previ-
ous layer and the tag embedding as input. Gating mechanism, as
defined in TreeGen [64], is used in this layer. It takes three vectors
named 𝒒, 𝒄1, 𝒄2 as input and aims to corporate 𝑐1 with 𝑐2 based on
𝒒. The computation of gating mechanism can be represented as

In our model, we treat the outputs of the self-attention sub-layer
𝒂1, 𝒂2, · · · , 𝒂𝐿 as 𝒒 and 𝒄1, and the tag embedding 𝒕1, 𝒕2, · · · , 𝒕𝐿 as 𝒄2.
Thus, embedding of the 𝑖th AST node of the gating-layer can be
represented as 𝒖𝑖 = Gating(𝒂𝒊, 𝒂𝒊, 𝒕𝑖 ).
3.1.3 Tree Conv Layer. This sub-layer takes the output 𝒖𝑖 of the
previous layer and the AST-based graph 𝐺 (represented as an adja-
cency matrix) as input. We adopt a GNN [62, 76] layer to process
the inputs, and the encoding of the neighbors 𝑟𝑖 is computed as
∑︁

𝑗

𝒈𝑖 = 𝑊𝑔

𝐴𝑛

𝑟 𝑖𝑟 𝑗 𝒖

(8)

𝑟 𝑗 ∈𝐺
where 𝑊𝑔 is the weight of a fully-connected layer and ˆ𝐴 is a nor-
malized adjacency matrix of 𝐺. The computation of the normal
operation proposed by Kipf and Welling [30] is represented as
ˆ𝐴 = 𝑆−1/2
, where 𝐴 is the adjacency matrix of 𝐺, and 𝑆1, 𝑆2
are the diagonal matrices with a summation of 𝐴 in columns and
rows. Then, the encoding of the neighbors is directly added to the
input vector.

In summary, the code reader has 𝑁1 blocks of these three sub-
layers, and yields the features of the input AST, 𝒕1, 𝒕2, · · · , 𝒕𝑳, which
would be used for the AST reader and the tree path reader.

3.2 AST Reader
The AST reader encodes the partial generated AST of the edit,
which has the same structure as the one in TreeGen [64]. This
component takes three inputs derived from the partial generated

AST as code reader. The rule sequence is represented as real-value
vectors and then is fed into a self-attention layer. We then integrate
the output of the self-attention layer with the rule encoding via a
gating layer as Equation 7. We also adopt a multi-head attention
layer over the outputs of the code reader and the gating layer like
the decoder-encoder attention in Transformer. Finally, we use a tree
convolutional layer like the code reader to extract the structural
information. More details of this component can be found in the
publication of TreeGen [64].

3.3 Tree Path Reader
The tree path reader encodes the information of the non-terminal
node to be expanded and is the same as the one in TreeGen [64].
This component represents the non-terminal node as a path from
the root to the node to be expanded and transforms the nodes in this
path into real-value vectors. As shown in Figure 7, these vectors
are fed into two attention layers like Equation 4. Finally, a set of
two fully-connected layers, where the first layer has a 𝐺𝐸𝐿𝑈 [20]
activation function, are followed to extract features for edit decoder.
More details of this component can be found in the publication
of TreeGen [64]. We denote the output of the tree path reader as
𝒅1, 𝒅2, · · · , 𝒅𝑇 .

3.4 Edit Decoder
The edit decoder takes the output of the tree path reader, 𝒅1, 𝒅2, · · · , 𝒅𝑇
with length 𝑇 , as input. These vectors are produced by the tree path
reader and contain the encoded information from all the inputs: the
faulty statement with its surrounding method, the partial AST gen-
erated so far, and the tree path denoting the node to be expanded.

3.4.1 Provider. As mentioned before, there are currently three
types of providers: rule predictor, tree copier, and subtree locator.
These providers take the vector 𝒅1, 𝒅2, · · · , 𝒅𝑇 as input and output
the probability of choices for different non-terminals.

Rule Predictor. The rule predictor estimates the probability of
each production rule in the grammar of edits. The neural component
of this decider consists of a fully-connected layer. The output of
the fully-connected layer is denoted as 𝒔1, 𝒔2, · · · , 𝒔𝑇 . Then, these
vectors are normalized via softmax, which computes the normalized
vectors 𝒑𝑟

2, · · · , 𝒑𝑟

1, 𝒑𝑟

𝑇 by

𝑟
𝑘 (𝑚) =

𝒑

exp{𝒔𝑚
𝑘 }
𝑗=1 exp{𝒔

(cid:205)𝑁𝑟

𝑗
𝑘 }

(9)

where 𝑁𝑟 denotes the number of production rules in the grammar
of edits, and 𝑚 denotes the 𝑚th dimension of the vector 𝒑𝑟
(i.e., the
𝑘
production rule with ID 𝑚). In particular, invalid rules whose left-
hand side is not the corresponding non-terminal are not allowed
in our approach. For these rules, the logic component resets the
output of the fully-connected layer to −∞. Thus, the probability of
invalid rules will be zero after softmax normalization.

Tree Copier. This provider is designed for any non-terminal
symbol in the grammar of edits to choose a subtree in the local
context. The neural component is based on a pointer network [68].
The computation can be represented as

𝜽𝑖 = 𝒗

𝑇 tanh(𝑊1𝒅𝑖 + 𝑊2𝒕)

(10)

2, · · · , 𝒑𝑠
𝑇

2, · · · , 𝒑𝑡
𝑇 .

where 𝒕 denotes the output of the code reader, and 𝒗,𝑊1,𝑊2 denote
the trainable parameters. The logic component also resets 𝜽 to −∞
if the root symbol of the corresponding subtree is different from
the symbol being expanded. These vectors are then normalized
via softmax as Equation 10. We denote the normalized vector as
1, 𝒑𝑡
𝒑𝑡
Subtree Locator. This component outputs an ID of the subtree
in the faulty statement for not-terminal symbol, Modify, in the
grammar of edits. The computation of this component is the same
as the tree copier. We denote the output vector of this provider as
1, 𝒑𝑠
𝒑𝑠
3.4.2 Decider. For these three providers, the decider estimates
the probability of using each provider. The neural component also
takes the output of the tree path reader, 𝒅1, 𝒅2, · · · , 𝒅𝑇 , as input,
and produces the probability of using each provider as output.
The computation can be represented as 𝝀𝑖 = 𝑊 𝒅𝑖 + 𝒃, where 𝑊
and 𝒃 denote the parameters of a fully-connected layer. The logic
component resets 𝝀 to −∞ if the corresponding provider is not
responsible for the symbol being expanded following Table 1. Then,
the vectors are normalized via softmax as Equation 9. We denote
the normalized vectors as 𝝀1, 𝝀2, · · · , 𝝀𝑇 . The final probability of
each choice can be computed as

𝑟
𝑖 ; 𝝀
where 𝒐𝑖 will be the probability vector of the next production rule
at 𝑖th step during patch generation.

𝒐𝑖 = [𝝀

𝑡
𝑖 ; 𝝀

𝑟
𝑖 𝒑

𝑠

(11)

3.5 Training and Inference
During training, the model is optimized by maximizing the negative
log-likelihood of the oracle edit sequence and we do not use the
logic component in the providers and decider. Here we would like
Recoder to learn the distribution of the rules handled by the logic
component. If the logic component is present at training, Recoder
would not be trained for a large portion of rules. During inference,
these unseen rules would distort the distribution of output, making
Recoder fail to distinguish the part of rules that it is supposed to
distinguish.

When generating edits, inference starts with the rule 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 :
start −→ Edits, expanding a special symbol start to Edits. The
recursive prediction terminates if every leaf node in the predicted
AST is a terminal. We use beam search with a size of 100 to generate
multiple edits.

Generated edits may contain placeholders. Though the number
of choices for a single placeholder is small, the combination of mul-
tiple placeholders may be large. Therefore, we discard patches con-
taining more than one placeholder symbol during beam search.

3.6 Patch Generation and Validation
Patches are generated according to the result of the fault local-
ization technique. In our approach, the model described above is
invoked for each suspicious faulty statement according to the re-
sult of fault localization. For each statement, we generate 100 valid
patch candidates via beam search: when beam search generates
a valid patch, we remove it from the search set and continue to
search for the next patch until 100 candidates are generated in total

ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece

Qihao Zhu, Zeyu Sun, Yuan-an Xiao, Wenjie Zhang, Kang Yuan, Yingfei Xiong, and Lu Zhang

for that statement. After patches are generated, the final step is to
validate them via the test suite written by developers. The valida-
tion step filters out patches that do not compile or fail a test case.
All generated patches are validated until a plausible patch (a patch
that passes all test cases) is found.

4 EXPERIMENT SETUP
We have implemented Recoder for the Java programming language.
In this and the next sections we report our experiments on repairing
Java bugs.

4.1 Research Questions
Our evaluation aims to answer the following research questions:
RQ1: What is the performance of Recoder?

To answer this question, we evaluated our approach on the
widely used APR benchmark, Defects4J v1.2, and compared it with
traditional and DL-based APR tools.
RQ2: What is the contribution of each component in Re-
coder?

To answer this question, we started from the full model of Re-
coder, and removed each component in turn to understand its con-
tribution to performance.
RQ3: What is the generalizability of Recoder?

To answer this question, we fisrt conducted an experiment on
420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0. To our best knowledge,
this is the first APR approach that has been applied to this bench-
mark. We compared Recoder with the previous two best-performing
APR approaches for single-hunk bugs on Defects4J v1.2, namely
TBar [40] and SimFix [24]. In addition, we also applied Recoder to
other two benchmarks, QuixBugs and IntroClassJava, via RepairThe-
mAll [10] framework, which allows the execution of automatic
program repair tools on benchmarks of bugs.

4.2 Dataset
The neural network model in our approach needs to be trained
with a large number of history patches. To create this training set,
we crawled Java projects created on GitHub [16] between March
2011 and March 2018, and downloaded 1,083,185 commits where
the commit message contains at least one word from the following
two groups, respectively: (1) fix, solve; (2) bug, issue, problem, error.
Commits were filtered to include only patches that modify one
single statement or insert one new statement, corresponding to two
types of edits that our approach currently supports. To avoid data
leak, we further discarded patches where (1) the project is a clone
to Defects4J project or a program repair project using Defects4J,
or (2) the method modified by the patch is the same as the method
modified by any patch in Defects4J v1.2 or v2.0, based on AST
comparison. There are 103,585 valid patches left after filtering,
which are further split into two parts: 80% for training and 20% for
validation.

We used four benchmarks to measure the performance of Re-
coder. The first one contains 395 bugs from Defects4J v1.2 [26],
which is a commonly used benchmark for automatic program repair
research. The second one contains 420 additional bugs from De-
fects4J v2.0 [26]. Defects4J v2.0 introduces 438 new bugs compared

with Defects4J v1.2. However, GZoltar [57], the fault localization ap-
proach used by our implementation as well as two baselines (TBar
and SimFix), failed to finish on the project Gson, so we excluded
18 bugs in Gson from our benchmark. The third one contains 40
bugs from QuixBugs [37], which is a benchmark with 40 buggy
algorithmic programs specified by test cases. The last one, Intro-
ClassJava [11], consists of 297 buggy Java programs generated from
the IntroClass [34] benchmark for C.

4.3 Fault Localization
In our experiment, two settings for fault localization are used. In the
first setting, the faulty location of a bug is unknown to APR tools,
and they rely on existing fault localization approaches to localize
the bug. Recoder uses Ochiai [1] (implemented in GZoltar [57]),
which is widely used in existing APR tools [24, 40]. In the second
setting, the actual faulty location is given to APR tools. This is to
measure the capability of patch generation without the influence
of a specific fault localization tool, as suggested and adopted in
previous studies [6, 44, 66].

4.4 Baselines
We selected existing APR approaches as the baselines for compar-
ison. Since Recoder generates only single-hunk patches (patches
that only change a consecutive code fragment), we chose 10 tradi-
tional single-hunk APR approaches that are often used as baselines
in existing studies: jGenProg [35], HDRepair [32], Nopol [73], Cap-
Gen [69], SketchFix [22], TBar [40], FixMiner [31], SimFix [24],
PraPR [15], AVATAR [39]. In particular, TBar correctly repairs the
highest number of bugs on Defects4J v1.2 as far as we know. We
also selected DL-based APR approaches that adopt the encoder-
decoder architecture to generate patches and have been evaluated
on Defects4J as baselines. Four approaches have been chosen based
on this criteria, namely, SequenceR [66], CODIT [6], DLFix [36],
and CoCoNuT [44].

For Defects4J v1.2, the performance data of the baselines are
collected from existing papers [40, 41]. For additional bugs from
Defects4J v2.0, two best-performing single-hunk APR approaches
on Defects4J v1.2, TBar and SimFix, are adapted and executed for
comparison. For QuixBugs and IntroClassJava, we directly choosed
the APR tools used in RepairThemAll [10] and DL-based APR tools
which have experimented on these two benchmarks as baselines:
jGenProg [35], RSRepair [55], Nopol [73], and CoCoNuT [44]. We
also directly used the result reported in the original papers [10, 44].

4.5 Correctness of Patches
To check the correctness of the patches, we manually examined
every patch if it is the same with or semantically equivalent to the
patch provided by Defects4J, as in previous works [15, 24, 36, 40,
44]. To reduce possible errors made in this process, every patch
is examined by two of the authors individually and is considered
correct only if both authors consider it correct. The kappa score of
the experiment is 0.98. Furthermore, we also publish all the patches
generated by Recoder for public judgment2.

Figure 9: Chart-8 - A bug fixed by Recoder with Modify op-
eration

Figure 10: Closure-104 - A bug fixed by Recoder with place-
holder generation

4.6 Implementation Details
Our approach is implemented based on PyTorch [53], with parame-
ters set to 𝑁1 = 5, 𝑁2 = 9, 𝑁3 = 2, i.e., the code reader contains a
stack of 5 blocks, the AST reader contains a stack of 9 blocks, and
the decoder contains a stack of 2 blocks, respectively. Embedding
sizes for all embedding vectors are set to 256, and all hidden sizes
are set following the configuration of TreeGen [64]. During train-
ing, dropout [21] is used to prevent overfitting, with the drop rate
of 0.1. The model is optimized by Adam [29] with learning rate
0.0001. These hyper-parameters and parameters for our model are
chosen based on the performance on validation set.

We set a 5-hour running-time limit for Recoder, following exist-

ing studies [24, 36, 44, 61].

5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
5.1 Performance of Recoder (RQ1)
5.1.1 Results without Perfect Fault Localization. We first compare
Recoder with the baselines in the setting where no faulty location
is given. Results as Table 2 shown only include baselines that have
been evaluated under this setting. As shown, Recoder correctly
repairs 51 bugs and outperforms all of the previous single-hunk
APR techniques on Defects4J v1.2. In particular, Recoder repairs
21.4% (9 bugs) more bugs than the previous state-of-the-art APR tool
for single-hunk bugs, TBar. Within our knowledge, Recoder is the
first DL-based APR approach that has outperformed the traditional
APR approaches.

We show a few example patches that are possibly generated with
the help of the novel techniques in Recoder. As shown in Figure 9,
Chart-8 is a bug that DLFix fails to fix. The correct patch only
changes a parameter of the method invocation while DLFix needs
to generate the whole expression. By contrast, Recoder generates
a modify operation that changes only one parameter. Figure 10
shows a bug only repaired by Recoder. This patch relies on a project-
specific method, “isNoType”, and thus cannot be generated by many
of the existing approaches. However, Recoder fixes it correctly by
generating a placeholder and then instantiating it with “isNoType”.

5.1.2 Results with Perfect Fault Localization. Table 3 shows the
result where the actual faulty location is provided. As before, only
baselines that have been evaluated under this setting are listed.
Recoder still outperforms all of the existing APR approaches, in-
cluding traditional ones. Also, compared with Recoder using Ochiai
for fault localization, this model achieves a 35.3% improvement. The
result implies that Recoder can achieve better performance with
better fault localization techniques.

Figure 11: Degree of Complementary.
5.1.3 Degree of Complementary. We further investigate to what
extent Recoder complements the three best-performing existing
approaches for fixing single-hunk bugs, TBar, SimFix, and DLFix.
Figure 11 reveals the overlaps of the bugs fixed by different ap-
proaches. As shown, Recoder fixes 19 unique bugs when compared
with three baselines. Moreover, Recoder fixes 34, 28, 27 unique bugs
compared with SimFix, TBar, and DLFix, respectively. This result
shows that Recoder is complementary to these best-performing
existing approaches for single-hunk bugs.

5.2 Contribution of Each Component (RQ2)
To answer RQ2, we conducted an ablation test on Defects4J v1.2 to
figure out the contribution of each component. Since the ablation
test requires much time, we only conducted the experiment based
on Ochiai Fault Localization scenario.

Table 4 shows the results of the ablation test. We respectively
removed three edit operations, modify, copy, and insert, as well
as the generation of placeholders. As shown in the table, removing
any of the components leads to a significant drop in performance.
This result suggests that the two novel techniques proposed in
Recoder are the key to its performance.

5.3 Generalizability of Recoder (RQ3)
The results on Defects4J v2.0, QuixBugs and IntroClassJava are
shown in Table 5 and Table 6. As shown, on Defects4J v2.0, all three
approaches repair a smaller proportion of bugs, suggesting that
the additional bugs on Defects4J v2.0 are probably more difficult to
repair. Nevertheless, Recoder still repairs most bugs compared with
baselines, 19 in total, achieving 137.5% (11 bugs) improvement over
TBar and 850.0% (17 bugs) improvement over SimFix. We believe
that the considerable performance drops of TBar and SimFix are
caused by their design: TBar is based on validated patterns on

-this(time, RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE,Locale.getDefault());+this(time, zone, Locale.getDefault());-if (result != null) {+ if(((result != null) && !result.isNoType())){ESEC/FSE ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Athens, Greece

Defects4J v1.2, which may not generalize beyond the projects in
Defects4J v1.2; SimFix relies on similar code snippets in the same
project, but new projects in Defects4J v2.0 are much smaller, and
thus the chance to find similar code snippets become smaller. On the
other hand, Recoder is trained from a large set of patches collected
from different projects and is thus more likely to generalize to new
projects. On QuixBugs and IntroClassJava, Recoder also repaired

775% (31 bugs) and 30.8% (4 bugs) more bugs on IntroClassJava and
QuixBugs over the baselines respectively, further confirming the
effectiveness and generalizability of Recoder.

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Adequacy of Dataset
To understand the adequacy of our training data, we trained Recoder
on differently sized subsets of the original training dataset and
calculate the loss over the single-hunk bugs in the Defects4J v1.2
dataset. For each subset, we train 5 models with different random
seeds and report the average performance of these models. Figure 12
shows the sensitivity analysis of dataset size for Recoder. As shown,
the loss and the diversity both decrease with the increase of training
subset size. Therefore, the performance of Recoder may further
increase if more training data are provided.

6.2 Limitations of Recoder
Recoder shares limitations common to most APR approaches: 1)
Bugs to be fixed should be reproducible by failing test cases. 2)
Effective fault localization is needed to identify the faulty state-
ment. Recoder also shares the limitations common to DL-based
approaches: The performance would degrade if the training set and
the testing set have different distributions.

7 RELATED WORK

DL-based APR Approaches. APR has been approached using
different techniques, such as heuristics or random search [33, 35, 45,
54], semantic analysis [7, 12, 22, 27, 39, 46–48], manually defined or
automatically mined repair patterns [2, 14, 23, 24, 31, 42, 52, 59], and
learning from source code [24, 43, 69–72]. For a thorough discussion
of APR, existing surveys [13, 17, 50, 51] are recommended to readers.
A closely related series of work is APR based on deep learn-
ing. The mainstream approaches treat APR as a statistical machine
translation that generates the fixed code with faulty code. Deep-
Fix [18] learns the syntax rules via a sequence-to-sequence model
to fix syntax errors. Nguyen et al. [52] and Tufano et al. [66] also
adopt a sequence-to-sequence translation model to generate the
patch. They use sequence-to-sequence NMT with a copy mecha-
nism. Chakraborty et al. [6] propose CODIT, which learns code
edits by encoding code structures in an NMT model to generate
patches. Li et al. [36] propose a Tree-LSTM to encode the abstract
syntax tree of the faulty method to generate the patches. CoCoNuT,
as proposed by Lutellier et al. [44], adopts CNN to encode the faulty
method and generates the patch token by token. Compared to
them, our paper is the first work that aims to improve the decoder
and employs a syntax-guided manner to generate edits, with the
provider/decider architecture and placeholder generation.

Multi-Hunk APR. Most of the above approaches generate single-
hunk patches—patches that change one place of the program. Re-
cently, Saha et al. [61] propose Hercules to repair multi-hunk bugs
by discovering similar code snippets and applying similar changes.
Since lifting single-hunk repair to multiple-hunk repair is a generic
idea and can also be applied to Recoder, we did not directly com-
pare Recoder with the multi-hunk repair tools in our evaluation.
Nevertheless, though Recoder only repairs single-hunk bugs, we
notice that it still outperforms Hercules by repairing 5 more bugs
on the Defects4J v1.0 (including all projects from v1.2 except for
Mockito), the dataset Hercules has been evaluated on.

DL-based Code Generation. Code generation aims to generate
code from a natural language specification and has been intensively
studied during recent years. With the development of deep learn-
ing, Ling et al. [38] propose a neural machine translation model
to generate the program token by token. Being aware that code
has the constraints of grammar rules and is different from natural
language, Yin and Neubig [75] and Rabinovich et al. [56] propose
to generate the AST of the program via expanding from a start
node. To integrate the semantic of identifiers, OCoR [77] proposes
to encode the identifiers at character level. To alleviate the long
dependency problem, a CNN decoder [63] and TreeGen (a tree-
based Transformer) [64] are proposed to generate the program. In

this paper, we significantly extend TreeGen to generate the edit
sequence for program repair.

DL-based Code Edit Generation. Several existing DL-based ap-
proaches also use the idea of generating edits on programs [4, 5, 9,
65, 74]. Tarlow et al. [65] view a program as a sequence of tokens
and generate a sequence of token-editing commands. Brody et al.
[4] view a program as a tree and generate node-editing or subtree-
editing commands. Dinella et al. [9] view a program as a graph and
generate node-editing commands. Compared with our approach,
there are three major differences. First, the existing approaches are
not syntax-guided and treat an edit script as a sequence of tokens.
As a result, they may generate syntactically incorrect edit scripts
and do not ensure syntactic correctness of the edited program. On
the other hand, our approach introduces the provider/decider ar-
chitecture and successfully realizes the syntax-guided generation
for edits. Second, none of the existing approaches support place-
holder generation, and thus are ineffective in generating edits with
project-specific identifiers. Third, the editing commands they use
are atomic and are inefficient in representing large changes. For
example, to insert a variable declaration, in our approach there
is one insert operation: insert(int var = 0;). However, the
existing approaches have to represent this change as a sequence of
5 insertions, where each insertion inserts one token.

8 THREATS TO VALIDITY

Threats to external validity. mainly lie in the evaluation dataset
we used. First, though our approach applies to different program-
ming languages, so far, we have only implemented and evaluated it
on Java, so future work is needed to understand its performance on
other programming languages. Second, though we have evaluated
on Defects4J v2.0, QuixBugs, and IntroClassJava, it is yet unknown
how our approach generalizes to different datasets [25]. This is a
future work to be explored.

Threats to internal validity. mainly lie in our manual assess-
ment of patch correctness. To reduce this threat, two authors have
independently checked the correctness of the patches, and a patch
is considered correct only if both authors consider it correct. The
generated patches also have been released for public assessment.

9 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose Recoder, a syntax-guided edit decoder
with placeholder generation for automated program repair. Re-
coder uses a novel provider/decider architecture to ensure accurate
generation and syntactic correctness of the edited program and
generates placeholders for project-specific identifiers. In the ex-
periment, Recoder achieved 21.4% improvement (9 bugs) over the
existing state-of-the-art APR approach for single-hunk bugs on
Defects4J v1.2. Importantly, Recoder is the first DL-based APR ap-
proach that has outperformed traditional APR techniques on this
benchmark. Further evaluation on three other benchmarks shows
that Recoder has better generalizability than some state-of-the-art
APR approaches.
