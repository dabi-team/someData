Abstract—The general public and medical professionals recog-
nized the importance of accurately measuring and storing blood
oxygen levels and heart rate during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The demand for accurate contact-less devices was motivated
by the need for cross-infection reduction and the shortage
of conventional oximeters, partially due to the global supply
chain issue. This paper evaluated a contact-less mini-program
HealthyPai’s heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2)
measurements compared with other wearable devices. In the HR
study of 185 samples (81 in the laboratory environment, 104
in the real-life environment), the mean absolute error (MAE) ±
standard deviation was 1.4827 ± 1.7452 in the lab, 6.9231 ± 5.6426
in the real-life setting. In the SpO2 study of 24 samples, the mean
absolute error (MAE) ± standard deviation of the measurement
was 1.0375 ± 0.7745. Our results validated that HealthyPai
utilizing the Integrated Image Deep Learning Solution (IIDLS)
framework can accurately measure HR and SpO2, providing the
test quality at least comparable to other FDA-approved wearable
devices in the market and surpassing the consumer-grade and
research-grade wearable standards.

I. INTRODUCTION

Heart Rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) are the
most focused measurements during the COVID-19 pandemic.
They are both essential metrics providing critical states of a
person to determine whether a person is infected by COVID,
especially at the early stage of COVID-19 due to the lack of
fast test kits. Even if the COVID mortality rate in the US
has in general declined following the virus mutation, HR and
SpO2 are still consistently tested among the health-focused
public. Separating people from exposing them to the virus as
a strategy to slow down its spread was widely leveraged across
the globe. There are numerous strategies to avoid gatherings,
such as social distancing, home quarantine, or centralized
quarantine. Decentralizing the medical level devices is the key
to the strategy’s success.

The establishing methods on vital signs measurement using
smartphone can be split into two categories: Photoplethysmog-
raphy (PPG)-based [2], [3] and remote Photoplethysmography

(rPPG)-based [4] methods. With each cardiac cycle, the heart
pumps blood to the periphery. With the change of blood
volume caused by the pressure, the light absorption is variant.
Both methods capture the minor variation of the light reﬂection
and generate a signal for vital signs measurement. The PPG-
based method is similar to the principle of some oximeters
which requires the users to put their ﬁngers to cover the
rear camera with illuminated ﬂashlight. The rear camera can
capture the variations of the ﬂow of blood within the vessels.
Kanva et al. [2] measured SpO2 and HR with smartphone rear
camera. Nemcovaa et al. [3] developed an Android application
to estimate HR, SpO2 and blood pressure simultaneously.

The rPPG method applies the same principle of PPG, while
the users need to turn on the front camera to capture the
face videos. Kwon et al. [4] built a smartphone application
called FaceBEAT that can measure users’ heart rate with face
videos. Qiao et al. [5] built an application that can measure HR
and HRV by using the smartphone front camera. Nam et al.
[6] utilized dual cameras to monitor HR and respiration rate.
The front camera is applied to capture the motions caused by
heartbeats and respirations.

The paper presents a robust workﬂow, Integrated Image
Deep Learning Solution (IIDLS), that realized the laboratory
results using real-life quality facial videos. We proved that
IIDLS can provide medical level accuracy requiring only on a
smartphone. We have tested the framework in the laboratory
environment in ensuring the theoretical highest quality results
that it can generate and compared the results with the medical
chest strap. We have also compared the real-life results with
those of the other products, such as the Apple Watch, Fitbit,
etc. , claiming offering the same in the markets.

the data and predict the outputs. The data preparation, the
ﬁrst major step shown in the workﬂow, extracts candidate
BVP signals from sampled multiple face patches. We apply
established algorithms to identify the best RoI from the users’
faces that maximize the true signal. Once data has been
extracted from the RoIs of the facial videos, it will be used
as the input to the deep learning algorithms. The model has
been trained by 104 videos taken in a real-life environment
and 84 videos taken in a laboratory environment preparing for
the corresponding comparisons.

III. RESULTS

There are two sets of comparison results depending on the
testing environment, in the laboratory environment and the
real-life environment.

A. Laboratory results

Nine participants, with one female, all of the East Asian
descendants and of different ages (20s - 60s) enrolled in the
experiment in the laboratory environment. The participants
were asked to sit on a chair 1.5m from the camera. The light in
the video is consistent from the beginning to the end. There are
three 60-second sessions, relax, exercise, and relax sessions, in
each 180-second video, where the participants were asked to
perform handgrip exercise in the exercise session. The video
resolution is VGA (640×480), and the frame rate is 300 fps.
Each video is extracted into nine 20-second sequences as the
input data ﬁtting the algorithm. Therefore, there are 81 samples
for both heart rate and SpO2 comparison.

Out of all 81 samples, the mean error (ME) between the
HR predicted value (through the HealthyPai algorithm) and
HR actual value (through the conventional testing devices) is
-0.1951 ± 2.2876. The MAE (Mean Average Error) between
the HR predicted value (through the HealthyPai algorithm) and
HR actual value (through the conventional testing devices) is
1.4827 ± 1.7452.

Compared to polar chest straps,

the laboratory results
demonstrate that HealthyPai, without any contact, can pro-
vide testing results comparable to the polar chest straps that
measure heart rate with maximum precision.

B. Real-life environment results

In total,

there are 25 participants (9 female, 16 male)
providing 104 samples in the heart rate comparison and 24
samples (23.08 % of all samples) in the SpO2 comparison.
All 100 % of the participants are of East Asian descent and
taking the videos while resting.

Out of all 104 samples, the mean error (ME) between the
HR predicted value (through the HealthyPai) and HR actual
value (through the conventional testing devices) is 0.6538 ±
8.9332. The MAE (Mean Average Error) between the HR
predicted value (through the HealthyPai) and HR actual value
(through the conventional testing devices) is 6.9231 ± 5.6426.
HealthyPai provides the quality of results that is at least
comparable to other FDA-approved wearable devices and
beyond the consumer-grade wearables, which gives an MAE
of 7.2 ± 5.4, and research-grade wearables, which gives an
MAE of 13.9 ± 7.8. The comparison results are signiﬁcant
through more samples that are collected.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

IIDLS has been thoroughly tested by collecting 185 samples
(81 in the lab, 104 in the real-life environment). The compar-
ison shows that IIDLS provides at least comparable quality
to other FDA-approved wearable devices in the market and
surpasses the consumer-grade and research-grade wearables
standards. The environment in which a video was taken is a
critical factor affecting the quality of the results. The closer
the surrounding environment is to the laboratory, the better
quality the user will receive. IIDLS is optimizing the de-noise
process to cleanse the signal to the model and has proactively
intervened users to either pause the video taking or re-take the
videos if the surrounding environment is less optimal.
