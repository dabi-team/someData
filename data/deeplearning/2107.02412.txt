Abstract

In this paper, we consider the problem of joint beam selection and link activation across a set of

communication pairs to effectively control the interference between communication pairs via inactivating

part communication pairs in ultra-dense device-to-device (D2D) mmWave communication networks. The

resulting optimization problem is formulated as an integer programming problem that is nonconvex and

NP-hard. Consequently, the global optimal solution, even the local optimal solution, cannot be generally

obtained. To overcome this challenge, this paper resorts to design a deep learning architecture based

on graph neural network to ﬁnish the joint beam selection and link activation, with taking the network

topology information into account. Meanwhile, we present an unsupervised Lagrangian dual learning

framework to train the parameters of the GBLinks model. Numerical results show that the proposed

GBLinks model can converges to a stable point with the number of iterations increases, in terms of the

weighted sum rate. Furthermore, the GBLinks model can reach near-optimal solution through comparing

with the exhaustive search scheme in small-scale ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks

and outperforms GreedyNoSched and the SCA-based method. It also shows that the GBLinks model

can generalize to varying densities and coverage regions of ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication

networks.

I. INTRODUCTION

Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication is a key enable technology for future wireless

networks, which can address the challenge of spectrum shortage. However, mmWave signals

encounter serious pathloss due to the large rain attenuation and Oxygen attenuation, etc. In order

to make up for this shortcoming, large-scale antenna array providing sufﬁcient antenna gain is

adopted in mmWave communication system [1]. However, for mmWave communication system,

the conventional digital beamforming techniques are not suitable because they require each

antenna element to have dedicated radio frequency (RF) link, which is expensive and consumes

too much energy. Hybrid beamforming, consisting of an analog and a digital beamforming,

is a cost-effective alternative, which can signiﬁcantly reduce the hardware cost and power

consumption by using a small number of RF links [2].

Recently, the researches on the design of hybrid beamforming for mmWave communication

have attracted extensive attentions in both academia and industry. O. E. Ayach et al. exploited

the sparsity of mmWave channels to investigate the design of hybrid precoder for maximizing the

throughput of a point-to-point communication system [3]. X. Gao et al. investigated the energy-

efﬁcient design of large-scale antenna array mmWave communication systems [4]. S. He et al.

studied the design of hybrid precoder for the downlink cache-enabled mmWave communication

networks [5]. L. Zhao et al. investigated an energy efﬁcient hybrid beamforming architecture with

low-resolution A/Ds equipped at both the transmitter and the receiver for multi-user mmWave

communication [6]. In addition, the directional transmission of mmWave communication helps

to solve the serious interference problem and improves the system throughput of wireless net-

works [7].

The fundamental problems are the user scheduling and the beamforming in multi-user multi-

input multi-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. P. C. Weeraddana et al. reviewed

the weighted sum-rate maximization problem in many network control and optimization methods,

such as power control, link scheduling, cross-layer control, and network utility maximization [8].

Furthermore, generally speaking, the existing design method of beamforming is based on a given

scheduled user set. Consequently, beamforming alone cannot generally achieve the optimal

performance of ultra-dense mmWave communication networks. This implies that an effective

3

joint beam design and user scheduling (link activation) method is necessary for ultra-dense

mmWave communication networks. J. Yu et al. investigated the problem of the maximum number

of links that can be successfully scheduled simultaneously under Rayleigh-fading and multiuser

interference without considering the problem of beam design. [9]. M. Ge et al. considered

the multiuser MIMO scheduling problem with ﬁxed beamforming vectors for dense wireless

networks with access point cooperation [10]. Y. Niu et al. investigated the path planning

and concurrent transmission algorithms for D2D mmWave communication network with ﬁxed

transmission beams [11]. Note that the aforementioned literature does not consider the problem

of joint beam design and user scheduling for multi-antenna communication systems. Recently, S.

He et al. considered the joint optimization of analog beam selection and user scheduling based on

limited effective channel state information (CSI) for a single cell downlink multi-user multiple-

input single-output (MISO) network [12]. The aforementioned references designed optimization

algorithms to directly solve the original optimization problem or its variants. However, they do

not exploit the information hidden in the wireless data to explore the transmission schemes for

wireless communication networks.

To address the challenges faced by the traditional optimization methods, machine learning

is becoming a powerful method to put intelligence into wireless networks, which can extract

the patterns from wireless network topology and complex radio conditions. There are mainly

two paradigms on this topic. The ﬁrst one is “end-to-end learning” directly employing a neural

network to approximate the near-optimal solution of an optimization problem. C. Xu et al. inves-

tigated the analog beam selection at transmitter and user scheduling strategy based on multi-agent

reinforcement learning for the downlink of multicell mmWave communication network [13]. J.

Zhang et al. formulated the problem of beam alignment and tracking as a stochastic bandit

problem and proposed two efﬁcient algorithms to address the problem considered [14]. H. Sun

et al. used a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to approximate the input-output mapping of the

classical weighted minimum mean square error algorithm to speed up the computation [15]. J.

Tao et al. proposed a deep neural network-based hybrid beamforming algorithm for multi-user

mmWave massive MIMO systems [16]. The second paradigm is “learning and optimization”,

which uses neural networks instead of traditional algorithms to learn more difﬁcult strategies.

Machine learning technique was used to replace the pruning strategy in the branch-and-bound

algorithm [17]. K. Lee et al. designed an iterative algorithm based on a typical optimization

technique and proposed a learning algorithm based on a neural network to jointly optimize the

4

transmit power and energy harvesting time to maximize the energy efﬁciency of the network [18].

In order to improve the performance and generalization ability of machine learning models, an

effective idea is to incorporate the network topology information into the architecture of learning

models avoiding learning the network topology from the data. W. Cui et al. showed that by

using a deep learning approach, it is possible to bypass the channel estimation and to schedule

links efﬁciently based solely on the geographic locations of communication pairs [19]. On the

other hand, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown good performance in non-Euclidean

scenarios in recent years, which can effectively exploit non-Euclidean data, e.g., CSI [20]. Y.

Shen et al. utilized GNNs to develop scalable methods for solving the power control problem

in K-user interference channels [21]. They also identiﬁed a family of neural networks message

passing GNNs (MPGNNs), and demonstrated that the radio resource management problems can

be formulated as graph optimization problems enjoying a universal permutation equivalence

property [22]. They also took power control for K single-antenna communication pairs and

beamforming for K communication pairs as two examples to analyze the performance and

generalization of MPGNN-based methods. To solve the problem of link scheduling, M. Lee

et al. constructed a fully-connected graph for the D2D network, and then proposed a novel

graph embedding-based method to address the link scheduling problem without requiring the

accurate CSI [23]. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method is near-optimal

compared with the existing state-of-art methods but is with only hundreds of training samples.

M. Eisen et al. introduced the random edge graph neural network (REGNN) in the wireless ad-

hoc network, which performs convolutions over random graphs formed by the fading interference

patterns in the wireless network [24]. Numerical results demonstrate that REGNN is an effective

parameterization for resource allocation policies for large-scale wireless networks.

Directional transmission has the ability to suppress interference, but the interference between

communication pairs may still be serious in ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks,

in which a large number of communication pairs want to simultaneously establish communication

links on the same time-frequency resource. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint

beam selection and link activation to effectively control the interference between communication

pairs via inactivating part communication pairs in ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication

networks. But, the authors of [12] and [13] only jointly consider the selection of analog beams

at the transmitter and user scheduling for the downlink single-cell multi-user MISO network.

When considering the problem of joint analog beam selection at communication pairs and user

5

scheduling, it becomes more challenging for ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks.

To overcome the difﬁculties encountered in solving the problem of joint beam selection and link

activation, we formulate the problem of interest as a combinatorial optimization problem by intro-

ducing the indicator variables of beam selections for ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication

networks. Then, a Lagrangian dual learning framework is proposed to train an end-to-end deep

learning model designed based on GNN, called GBLinks, to solve the considered optimization

problem. The main contributions are listed as follows

• The joint beam selection and link activation problem is described as a constrained combina-

torial optimization problem aiming at maximizing the total throughput. The variables needed

to be optimized are the beam selection indicators of transmitter and receiver. Meanwhile,

these variables are used to indirectly indicate the link activation in ultra-dense D2D mmWave

communication networks.

• A Lagrangian dual learning framework (LDLF) is proposed to train the GBLinks model in

an unsupervised manner, which is utilized to parameterize the GBLinks model and satisfy

the constraints we considered. Then the GBLinks model is designed based on GNNs to

generate the beam selection and link activation policies, namely, the prediction of beam

selection indicators.

• We also propose an optimization method based on successive convex approximation (SCA)

to address the formulated problem. We further discuss the scheme of the initialization and

the update of Lagrangian multipliers of the provided algorithms.

• We use unlabeled data set to verify the effectiveness of LDLF, performance, and gener-

alization ability evaluation of the GBLinks model. The numerical results show that the

GBLinks model can reach a near-optimal solution through comparing with exhaustive

search scheme in small-region ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks and

outperforms GreedyNoSched and the SCA-based method. In addition, the GBLinks model

has better generalization ability in terms of varying densities and coverage regions of ultra-

dense D2D mmWave communication networks.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we propose the spatial sharing

D2D mmWave communication network and formulated joint beam selection and link activation

problem as a binary integer programming non-convex optimization problem. In Section III, we

solve it using the DC method and Lagrangian dual theory. In Section IV, we propose a GNN-

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

A. System Model

Consider an ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication network, as illustrated in Fig. 1, in

which there are N distinct multi-antennas transmitter-receiver pairs to establish dense com-

munication links via directional transmission on the same time-frequency resource. Let

, N

be the set of N distinct multi-antennas transmitter-receiver pairs. Each transmitter is

equipped with a single RF chain connecting with Nt transmit antennas via Nt phase shifters 1.

· · ·

}

1It is worth noting that the proposed GBLinks model can be applied in the communication systems with an arbitrary number

of RF chains by viewing each RF chain equipped in a transmitter or receiver as a virtual transmitter or receiver. Meanwhile,

an indicator for each RF chain of a transmitter or receiver is used to determine whether a RF chain is selected or not. If all

indicators for the RF chains of a transmitter or receiver are zeros, i.e., no RF chains are selected, the transmitter or receiver is

not activated. Otherwise, the transmitter or receiver is activated.

Similarly, each receiver is also equipped with a single RF chain connecting with Nr transmit

m-th receiver and the n-th transmitter. For mmWave communication, generally speaking, there

are only limited scatterers between communication pairs [25]. Therefore, in this paper, channel
matrix Hm,n is modeled as a narrowband clustered Saleh-Valenzuela model. Each scatterer is

further assumed to contribute a single propagation path to the channel between the transmitter
and receiver. Thus, channel matrix Hm,n is given by [3]

respectively the average path-loss and the complex gain of the p-th path between the m-th receiver

and the n-th transmitter. Assume that a uniform linear array (ULA) with half wavelength antenna

spacing is adopted at the communication pairs. In particular, for an Nt-element ULA, the array

Due to the existing large pathloss of mmWave communication, in general, analog beams

adopted by the communication pairs need to be determined before formally transmitting data.

One of the beam training methods is to train the analog beams based on a predeﬁned codebook

to obtain the optimum beam pairs that maximize the desired receiving signal energy without

considering the interference between each other [26]. Similarly, in this paper, we assume that

the analog beams used at the communication pairs come from a predesigned codebook. For
ease of notation, let Ut and Vr be the codebook matrix used at the transmitter and receiver,
respectively. The numbers of columns in codebook matrix Ut and Vr are Nt and Nr, respectively.
Furthermore, the column vector in Ut and Ur is the unit-norm vector. The baseband signal ym

B. Problem Formulation

To maximize the total throughput of ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks, the

interference between communication pairs needs be carefully controlled by properly selecting

the analog transmitting and receiving beams and activating some communication links. In this

subsection, we formulate the joint beam selection and link activation as maximizing the total

throughput of ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks. To effectively characterize the

beam selection, we deﬁne two indicators φm,r and ϕn,l that denote the receiving and transmitting

analog beam indicies used at the m-th receiver and the n-th transmitter, respectively. In particular,
if the n-th transmitter adopts the l-th codeword, i.e., the l-th column of Ut, as the transmitting
. Similarly, if the
analog beam, then ϕn,l = 1, otherwise ϕn,l = 0, n
m-th receiver uses the r-th codeword, i.e., the r-th column of Vr as the receiving analog beam,

Constraints (4a) and (4b) make ϕn,t and φm,r be binary variables. Constraints (4c) and (4d)

assure that the transmitter and receiver only select a single beam for each communication link.

Constraint (4e) assures that the receiving and transmitting beams are simultaneously activated

for a communication pair. Thus, without introducing confusion, the achievable rate Rm,r,t of

the m-th communication pair with the r-th receiving beam at the m-th receiver and the t-th

transmitting beam at the m-th transmitter is deﬁned as

m,r

which guarantees each transmitter or receiver only uses a single beam or do not use beam
from the system model. For ease of presentation, let Ψ and Φ be the indicator matrices for the
transmitting and receiving analog beam, respectively, where [Ψ]n,l = ϕn,l and [Φ]m,r = φm,r.

is to activate as more communication pairs as possible aiming at maximizing the throughput of

ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks. As we known that the user rate function

is non-convex, therefore, problem (6) is a binary integer programming non-convex optimization

problem, which is very difﬁcult to solve.

10

As far as we know, our work is the ﬁrst to perform joint beam selection and link activation

for ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks with multiple communication pairs.

Generally speaking, there are two simple scheme to solve problem (6), which are illustrated as

follows

• Exhaustive Search Scheme: There is no doubt that the optimal solution can be obtained

using exhaustive search in the beam space of communication pairs. However, the com-

N !

putational complexity of exhaustive search scheme is

N =
k!(N −k)!. The computational overhead of exhaustive search scheme will rise sharply as the
numbers of beams and communication pairs increase.

• GreedyNoSched: There is a simple method without considering the interference between

communication pairs. Speciﬁcally, each communication pair chooses the beam pair that

maximizes the desired receiving signal energy, we call it GreedyNoSched scheme. The

computational complexity of GreedyNoSched is

(NNrNt). Although the complexity of

O

this scheme is low, it may not be ideal in performance as illustrated in Section V.

Due to the drawback of exhaustive search scheme and GreedyNosched, an effective scheme

of joint beam selection and link activation is needed to improve the performance in terms of

the weighted sum rate with a proper computational complexity. Note that the difﬁculties of

solving problem (5) are the binary optimization variable and non-convex objective function. To

obtain a tractable form of problem (5), constraints (4a) and (4b) are equivalently reformulated

as follows [12]

In general, problem (8) is a non-convex and NP-hard problem. Its optimal solution is difﬁcult

to obtain, even the local optimal solution cannot be obtained directly. Although optimization

11

problem (8) can be solved by the SCA method [27], which is proposed in the Appendix, it

requires a lot of computational overhead.

The proposed SCA-based method has several defects, which are not limited to the SCA-based

method. Although the SCA-based method can get a local optimal solution, its computational

complexity increases sharply with the increase of the number of communication pairs and

antennas. Furthermore, the SCA-based method not only needs to solve problem (8) for each

single instance, but also may need to adjust the parameters of the SCA-based method for each

speciﬁc instance. Motivated by these observations, we would like to resort an effective and

efﬁcient manner to solve problem (8). Speciﬁcally, inspired by the successful application of GNN

in wireless networks [21], we propose to utilize GNN to learn the mapping between the channel
coefﬁcient matrix H, codebook matrices Ut and Vr, and the corresponding (near)-optimal beam
selection policies Ψ and Φ. In this way, the beam selection policies can be efﬁciently obtained

by the learned mapping without solving the optimization problem for each new instance. In the

sequel, we elaborate the design of GNN-based model, i.e., GBLinks, and its training scheme to

address problem (8).

III. LAGRANGIAN DUAL LEARNING FRAMEWORK

In this section, we focus on proposing a Lagrangian Dual Learning Framework (LDLF)

to train the GBLinks model designed and discussed in detail in the following section. Due

to there are a large mount of constraints in problem (8), it is ﬁrstly transformed into an

unconstrained optimization problem. Speciﬁcally, the Lagrange multiplier method is utilized

to deal with problem (8). Let ν, ξ, ρ

capture how much the constraints are violated and to guarantee the update value of Lagrangian

multipliers is always positive, we use the violation degree for (4c)-(4e), and relax (7c) and (7d)

based on the satisﬁability degree. Then, the partial Lagrangian relaxation function of problem (8)

is formulated as

In general, alternative optimization is a preferable selection for solving the max-min optimiza-

tion problem, as shown in Fig. 2. In particular, we minimize Lagrangian relaxation function (9)
over primal variables Φ and Ψ with ﬁxed dual variables. Then, we maximize Lagrangian

relaxation function (9) over dual variables λ, µ, ν, ξ and ρ with ﬁxed primal variables. For

the outer optimization problem, taking the ℓ-th iteration as example with given primal variables

IV. DESIGN OF THE GBLINKS MODEL

In this section, we focus on designing the GBLinks model to learn the policies of beam

selection and link activation in an unsupervised manner, which is under the framework of GNNs.

We ﬁrst introduce the method of building wireless channel graph for ultra-dense D2D mmWave

communication networks, and then propose a GBLinks model to learn the joint beam selection

and link activation policies.

A. Wireless Channel Graph Construction

In this subsection, we focus on building a wireless channel graph for the considered ultra-dense

D2D mmWave communication network with N distinct multi-antennas communication pairs.

Note that a communication pair is activated or deactivated and may interfere with each other in the

ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication network. The wireless channel graph is constructed

as a directed complete wireless channel graph, i.e.,

of all the communication pairs, and

E

different communication pairs. Fig. 3. gives out an example of a directed wireless channel

graph for a four communication pairs D2D mmWave communication network. In Fig. 3(a),

Ti and Ri represent the i-th transmitter and the i-th receiver, respectively, and TRi represents

the i-th communication pair, i

. The blue arrow denotes the direct link and the yellow

communication pair TRi, i

The GBLinks model is an end-to-end learning model and is consist of K layers, as shown

in Fig. 4. Each layer consists of a graph convolution module. Let Φ(k)

2Generally speaking, the acquisition cost of physical CSI is large in multi-antenna wireless communication systems. Note that

the proposed GBLinks model only depends on the equivalent CSI, which can be obtained by beam scanning without needing

the speciﬁc training overhead for the acquisition of physical CSI. Therefore, the proposed GBLinks model is effective and

efﬁcient for the ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks. In the future work, to efﬁciently handle the ultra-dense

D2D mmWave communication networks with massive communication pairs, we would like to investigate a distributed learning

model for ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks.

RN ×Nt be the beam selection policies of receiver and transmitter obtained in the k-th layer,

respectively. The input of the GBLinks model is

Φ(0), Ψ(0)

Φ(K), Ψ(K)

outputted by the K-th layer. For the convenience of description, we

only describe the update mode of the beam selection policies of the m-th vertex in the k-th

layer. The input of the k-th layer is the output of the (k

Φ(k−1), Ψ(k−1)

. The

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

of graph convolution module. Speciﬁcally, MLP1 is a MLP for aggregating the information of

the beam selection and the features of neighbor vertices and edges. Ξ is a function to generate

a vector. MLP2 and MLP3 are used to combine the aggregated information, and to update the

beam selection policies of communication pairs. The white boxes and grey boxes correspond

to dynamic inputs and the static input tensor κ, respectively. The blue boxes denote the hidden

layers of MLPs and the orange boxes denote the output of each functional module.

The core of the GBLinks model is to design the graph convolution module, which is utilized

to pass and update the information of vertices or edges of the directed complete wireless channel

graph. The information passing and updating mechanisms are called AGGREGATE and COM-

BINE, respectively, which are the most important functions we should discuss in the follows.

Generally speaking, the functions AGGREGATE and COMBINE are used to update a vertex’s

hidden state, i.e., the beam selection policies. The information aggregation and combination

strategies AGGREGATE and COMBINE are designed using the spatial-based graph convolution

network. At the k-th layer, the AGGREGATE mechanism is designed as

For ease of description, we give an illustration of implementing such graph convolution module

for vertex m, which is shown in Fig. 5. Vertex m and its neighbor vertices, i.e., a, b and c,

interfere with each other. Before aggregating the feature information from vertex m’s neighbor

vertices, each neighbor vertex will ﬁrstly do a nonlinear transform for vertex feature, edge feature

and the beam selection polices outputted by the previous iteration. Then, vertex m aggregates

the transformed neighbor vertices’ information and updates its beam selection policies. In the

next subsection, we will focus on proposing a learning strategy for GBLinks model.

Remark 1. The proposed GBLinks model is an unsupervised learning model without requiring

the ground truth, which just needs the feature κ as input. The loss function associated with the

Fig. 5. Illustration of implementating graph convolution module.

GBLinks model is Lagrangian relaxation function (12) with ﬁxed Lagrangian multipliers. It is

worth noting that equations (13) and (14) are vertex level operations. Therefore, the input of the

GBLinks model is only limited to the dimension of the features, i.e., the number of antennas, not

to the number of communication pairs. Further, the input sequence of communication pairs does

not need to be ﬁxed because two symmetric functions MAX (

) and MEAN (

) are used [28].

·

·

In addition, the output of the GBLinks model can be adjusted adaptively according to the

number of communication pairs. As long as the antenna conﬁguration of the ultra-dense D2D

mmWave communication networks remains unchange, the application of the GBLinks model will

not be affected. Therefore, the GBLinks model adapts to a network with varying number of

communication pairs with the same conﬁguration of antennas.

C. Summarization of LDLF

In this subsection, we would like to propose a learning scheme, i.e., LDLF, for training the

GBLinks model. Let w be the set of trainable parameters of the GBLinks model, which is
utilized to generate beam selection policies Φ and Ψ. The overall training scheme of LDLF is

presented in Algorithm 1, where

n
l=1 is a set of data with n being the total number of
training samples, and ξ > 0 denotes the step size of optimizer. LDLF is implemented for a ﬁxed

each epoch, we store the subgradient of Lagrangian multipliers with the whole dataset (lines 8-

12). Finally, after each epoch, the Lagrangian multipliers are updated following (11a)-(11e) (line

14).

Remark 2. When the GBLinks model is trained based on LDLF, the weight parameters of the

GBLinks model and Lagrangian multipliers can be adjusted until the constraints of (8) are

satisﬁed. Speciﬁcally, the weight parameters of the GBLinks model is approximated using the

Adam optimizer [29]. Once the GBLinks model is trained, it can be utilized directly to a new

ultra-dense D2D mmWave network instances without considering the constraints and Lagrangian

D. Computational Complexity Analysis

In this subsection, we would like to analyze the computational complexity of the GBLinks

complexity of MLP1 is KN(3

model. Given N, Nt, Nr, and the number of layers of the GBLinks model K, the computational
28NtNr + 29Nt + 215 + 213), the computational complexity of
MLP2 is KN(28NtNr + 28Nt + 216 + 213 + 26Nt), the computational complexity of MLP3 is
KN(28NtNr + 28Nt + 216 + 213 + 26Nr), and the computational complexity of equation (13b) is
27K(N

1). Therefore, the total computational complexity for the GBLinks model is KN(5

1). TABLE III gives out the comparison of

the GBLinks model with other methods from varying N, Nt, and Nr. It is worth noting that the

computational complexity of other methods is analyzed with big-

O

. Due to the GBLinks model

in numerical simulations only utilizes one layer, we set K = 1. We also assume that the number

of the operation times of Step 2 in Algorithm 2 is one. It is not hard to ﬁnd that GreedyNoSched

has the lowest computational complexity, but its performance is not very good, which is shown

in Section V. C. Meanwhile, the GBLinks model achieves the lowest computational complexity

among the methods except for GreedyNoSched.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we present numerical results to evaluate the effectiveness of the GBLinks

model. We ﬁrst introduce the generation method of the datasets and some parameter settings of

LDLF. Then we discuss the convergence and performance of the GBLinks model. Finally, we

analyze the generalization ability of the GBLinks model.

A. Simulation Setup

The locations of communication pairs are generated randomly. Speciﬁcally, the locations of

communication pairs are uniformly generated within the region, and the locations of receivers are
generated according to a uniform distribution within a pairwise distances of d1 ∼
their respective communication pairs. An illustration of generated network topology with three

d2 meters from

communication pairs is showed in Fig. 6. The green line denotes the distance of a communication

pair. The red lines denote horizontal and vertical projections of the distance of a communication

pair. The blue line denotes the distance of transmitter and receiver associated different commu-
nication pairs. The angle βi ∈
distribution, which is used to determine the location of receiver corresponding to a transmitter

is also randomly generated following a uniform

B. Effectiveness of LDLF

In this subsection, we would like to present the effectiveness of training scheme, i.e., LDLF.

Speciﬁcally, we consider N = 20 communication pairs with Nt = 16 and Nr = 16 in a

50 m

×

50 m region, and d1 = 10 m, d2 = 40 m. Fig. 7 illustrates the convergence behavior of

LDLF. The left part of Fig. 7 depicts that the GBLinks model trained based on LDLF converges

to a stable point with the number of iterations increases, in terms of the weighted sum rate. To

examine the feasibility of LDLF, in the right part of Fig. 7, the constraints (4c)-(4e) and (7c)-

(7d) are evaluated on average. It can be seen that the GBLinks model becomes feasible after the

1.2

×

105-th training iterations.

C. Performance Comparison

In this subsection, we would like to evaluate the performance of the GBLinks model for the

case in which the samples in the training dataset and testing dataset have the same number of

communication pairs.

Fig. 8 gives out the comparisons between the GBLinks model, the exhaustive search scheme,

GreedyNoSched and the SCA-based method for the testing dataset in terms of the weighted sum

rate in a smaller-scale D2D mmWave communication network with N = 3 and Nt = Nr = 8 4.

Speciﬁcally, the communication pairs are randomly located in a 5 m

5 m network coverage

×

region with d1 = 4 m and d2 = 5 m. Fig. 8(a) illustrates how the GBLinks model converges to

is illustrated in Fig. 8(b), where Ra1 =

the near-optimal solution as the iteration increases. Then, the percentage pie-chart of ratio Ra1
Weighted sum rate achieved by the exhaustive search scheme . We can see
that about 74.33% of the testing samples, the value of Ra1 is larger than 0.9. Fig. 8(c) shows

Weighted sum rate achieved by GBLinks

a histogram of weighted sum rates over the entire testing dataset. The empirical distribution of

weighted sum rates across different samples shows that the GBLinks model and the exhaustive

search scheme obtain a similar weighted sum rate performance for most testing samples. In

addition, in Fig. 8(d), we observe that the performance of the GBLinks model is close to that of

the exhaustive search scheme in terms of the weighted sum rate value. While the performance

of the SCA-based method is a little worse than that of the GBLinks model but is better than

that of GreedyNoSched in terms of the weighted sum rate value.

4 Due to the high computational complexity of exhaustive search scheme and the SCA-based method, it is almost undesirable

to obtain the optimal beam selection and link activation strategies using exhaustive search scheme or the SCA-based method

for large-scale networks. Therefore, we only compare the four methods aforementioned in small-scale wireless network.

23

Fig. 8. Performance evaluation for the GBLinks model in a smaller D2D mmWave communication network.

Remark 3. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the performance of the GBLinks model is better than the

SCA-based method, and can reach about 90% of the performance of the exhaustive search

scheme. And the computational complexity of the GBLinks model is much lower than that of

the SCA-based method. Of course, to further improve the performance of the GBLinks model,

we can consider the feature design and model structure design of the GBLinks model, which is

also our work in the future. In fact, from Fig. 8(a), it is not hard to ﬁnd that the GBLinks model

has converged in 1

105, which denotes that 250 epoches is sufﬁcient for the training of the

×

GBLinks model. To reduce the number of iterations, we can appropriately increase the value of

batchsize when training the GBLinks model according to the performance of the device used. In

addition, the GBLinks model is trained in an off-line manner, which does not need to iterate in

actual use.

Table III lists the performance comparison between the GBLinks model and GreedyNoSched

in larger-scale ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks in terms of the ratio Ra2,
where Ra2 = Weighted sum rate achieved by GBLinks

24

conﬁgurations of the number of antennas and communication pairs in a 50 m

50 m network

×

coverage region with d1 = 10 m and d2 = 40 m. For a given network conﬁgurations, i.e., the

number of antennas and communication pairs, as well as the coverage region, the testing dataset

is independently generated with different values of d1 and d2. As shown in Table IV, the GBLinks

model achieves a competitive performance advantage compared to GreedyNoSched. It shows that

the GBLinks model can be applied in a new scenario with different values of d1 and d2 in a

given network conﬁgurations. Therefore, the GBLinks model initially has the ability to adapt

to the network scenario of mobile communication pairs. For the same antenna conﬁgurations

and coverage region, the performance gain achieved by the GBLinks model becomes large with

an increasing number of communication pairs due to the existing of multiuser diversity gain.

However, for the same number of communication pairs and coverage region, the interference

mitigation ability of antenna array increases with the increasing number of antennas in the array.

Consequence, the performance gain obtained by the GBLinks model becomes weak.

Fig. 9 gives a joint beam selection and link activation consequence with N = 30 and

Nt = Nr = 16. The numbers within the red square and green circle represent the index of

communication pairs. Black arrow lines denote the direct link activated associated with a com-

munication pair, and blue numbers nearing to Rx and Tx indicate the selected beams. From the

output of beam selection and link scheduling, 21 communication pairs of the 30 communication

pairs are activated, and the activated communication pairs have selected the corresponding beams.

The ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication network after link activation is relatively sparse,

which alleviates the strong interference to a certain extent.

D. Generalization Evaluation of GBLinks

In this subsection, we further evaluate the generalization ability of the GBLinks model to

reveal its ability to adapt to the dynamic network scenarios. Speciﬁcally, the GBLinks model is

trained separately with different conﬁgurations of the number of antennas and communication

pairs but with the same network density N/A = 3

250 , d1 = 10 m and d2 = 40 m. In the sequel

simulations, the value of SNR is set to be 0 dB.

Generalization to varying network densities: The testing datasets are generated with different

×

N in a 50 m

50 m network coverage region. We compare the GBLinks model with Gree-

dyNoSched in terms of Ra2 and Ra3 =

Weighted sum rate achieved by GBLinks with N =20. As shown in
Table V, for the testing datasets used by the same trained GBLinks model, we observe that the

Weighted sum rate achieved by GBLinks

ratio Ra2 is increasing as N increases, i.e., the network density becomes large. The ratio Ra3

does not decrease when the trained model with smaller N is used to evaluate the testing datasets

with larger N. This implies that the GBLinks model can generalize to the network situations

with larger N, i.e., more dense D2D mmWave communication network. In addition, for the same

testing dataset, the values of the ratios Ra2 and Ra3 obtained by the trained model with smaller

N are similar to that obtained by the trained model with larger N, respectively. This inspires us

to use a GBLinks model with smaller N to deal with the network scenarios with larger N on the

premise of ensuring that the network density is close. Therefore, the GBLinks model trained with

smaller N has the ability to deal with the more dense D2D mmWave communication networks.

Generalization to varying network coverage regions: The testing datasets are generated with

different N while ﬁxing the network density as the same as the trained models. As shown in

Table VI, for the same testing dataset, the ratio Ra2 obtained by the trained model with smaller

N is similar to that obtained by the trained model with larger N. It veriﬁes again the network

scenarios with larger N (more dense) can be handled by the GBLinks model with smaller N (less

dense). In addition, combined with Table IV, for the testing datasets with the same conﬁgurations,

i.e., the number of antennas and communication pairs, but different network coverage regions

validated by the same trained model, the performance gain of the testing datasets achieved

by the trained GBLinks model in the scenario with smaller network coverage region (smaller

distribution space of communication pairs) is better than that in the scenario with larger network

coverage region (larger distribution space of communication pairs). This is because in a smaller

network coverage region, the interference between communication pairs is relatively strong,

and the performance of GreedyNoSched becomes worse. In contrast, the effective joint beam

selection and link scheduling reduces the interference between communication pairs to a certain

extent. In a word, the GBLinks model achieves a competitive performance advantage compared

to GreedyNoSched in terms of the ratios Ra2. It shows that the performance of the GBLinks

model is stable as the network coverage region varies. Therefore, the GBLinks model has a

certain ability to generalize to varying network coverage regions.

Remark 4. Based on the simulation results, the input and output of the GBLinks model are

only restricted by the number of antennas equipped at the communication pairs. That is, if the

number of antennas in the wireless communication system changes, we must retrain the GBLinks

model. In contrast, if the number of antennas does not change, from the results of numerical

results, we have the following conclusions. On one hand, if the network coverage region does not

change, the changes of the network density have little effect on the performance of the GBLinks

model. Therefore, in this case, we do not need retrain the GBLinks model. To save the time and

memory costs of training the GBLinks model, it is enough to train a GBLinks model based on

fewer number of communication pairs in advance. On the other hand, simulation results show

that the performance in terms of the weighted sum rate of the GBLinks model, which is trained

in a ﬁxed network coverage region, decreases when testing the GBLinks model in a much larger

or smaller network coverage region. Hence, when the network coverage region becomes much

28

larger or smaller than that of the current pre-trained GBLinks model, we recommend retraining

the GBLinks model according to the current network coverage region.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we formulated the joint beam selection and link activation problem in ultra-dense

D2D mmWave communication networks as a constrained binary integer non-convex optimization

problem. In this optimization problem, we just need to optimize the beam indicator variables of

transmitter and receiver to ﬁnish the joint beam selection and link activation. To address the non-

convex and NP-hard problem, we proposed an end-to-end GNN-based learning model named

GBLinks, to learn the beam indicator variables, which is trained based on the LDLF proposed.

Numerical results show that the proposed GBLinks model can converges to a stable point with the

number of iterations increases, in terms of the weighted sum rate. Meanwhile, the GBLinks model

can reach near-optimal solution through comparing with exhaustive search scheme in small-scale

ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks and outperforms GreedyNoSched and the

SCA-based method. It also shows that the GBLinks model can generalize to varying network

densities and network coverage regions of ultra-dense D2D mmWave communication networks.

For the future directions, it is interesting to solve the considered problem based on deep unfolding.

In problem (22), the optimization variables are ϕn,l, φm,r, and ¯wm,n,r,l,

Nt. Problem (22) is convex and can be solved using classical optimization methods. The detailed
steps of solving problem (15) is outlined in Algorithm 2, where η(t) and ς (τ ) denote the objective

values of problem (22) at the t-th iteration and the τ -th iteration, respectively. We only activate

a single communication pair in the initialization of ϕ, φ and ¯w, e.g., ϕ1,1 = 1, φ1,1 = 1 and

¯w1,1,1,1 = 1, while ϕm,t = 0, φm,r = 0 and ¯wm,n,r,t = 0 if m, n, r, t

= 1.

Remark 5. In Algorithm 2, for given Lagrangian multipliers ϑ(t) and δ(t), we iteratively solve

problem (22) until the objective value ς (τ ) converges. In addition, the initialization of ϑ(0) and

δ(0) should be smaller values that helps to ﬁnd a better solution of (22), the update step-size

ǫ should be a larger value, ϕn,t and φm,r that are not equal 0 or 1 converge to 0 or 1 more

quickly.

The convergence of Algorithm 2 can be guaranteed by the theory of SCA [35]. Note that

in (22), there are totally K , N 2NrNt +NNr +NNt optimization variables, and J , 4N 2NrNt +
