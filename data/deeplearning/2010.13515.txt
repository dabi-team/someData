Syllabification of the Divine Comedy

We provide a syllabiﬁcation algorithm for the Divine Comedy using techniques from probabilistic and constraint program-
ming. We particularly focus on the synalephe, addressed in terms of the “propensity” of a word to take part in a synalephe
with adjacent words. We jointly provide an online vocabulary containing, for each word, information about its syllabiﬁcation,
the location of the tonic accent, and the aforementioned synalephe propensity, on the left and right sides. The algorithm is
intrinsically nondeterministic, producing diﬀerent possible syllabiﬁcations for each verse, with diﬀerent likelihoods; metric
constraints relative to accents on the 10th, 4th and 6th syllables are used to further reduce the solution space. The most likely
syllabiﬁcation is hence returned as output. We believe that this work could be a major milestone for a lot of diﬀerent inves-
tigations. From the point of view of digital humanities it opens new perspectives on computer assisted analysis of digital
sources, comprising automated detection of anomalous and problematic cases, metric clustering of verses and their catego-
rization, or more foundational investigations addressing e.g. the phonetic roles of consonants and vowels. From the point of
view of text processing and deep learning, information about syllabiﬁcation and the location of accents opens a wide range
of exciting perspectives, from the possibility of automatic learning syllabiﬁcation of words and verses, to the improvement
of generative models, aware of metric issues, and more respectful of the expected musicality.

INTRODUCTION

1
The Divina Commedia is a famous narrative poem by Dante Alighieri, and one of the most inﬂuential works in
European literature. It is structured into three cantiche (Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso), each one composed
by 33 canti, plus an initial, introductory canto, traditionally considered as part of the Inferno.

The scheme of verses is the so called terza rima, based on lines of eleven syllables (hendecasyllables) [2]
structured in tercets following the rhyme scheme aba, bcb, cdc, ded, . . . Each tercet is hence composed by 33
syllables, similarly to the number of canti in each cantica.

Diﬀerently from the quantitative verse of ancient classical poetry (Greek and Latin), the hendecasyllable of
medieval and modern poetry is accentual. The key characteristic is the stress on the tenth syllable; in the frequent
case where the ﬁnal word is stressed on the penultimate syllable (parola piana), the previous constraint produces
verses of eleven syllables. The verse also has a stress preceding the caesura [3, 6], on either the sixth or the fourth
syllable. The poet may add additional accents providing rhythmic variations that help to obtain stylistic eﬀects.
An essential prerequisite to follow the rhythm of the verse [4, 5] is to correctly identify its syllables. For several
reasons that we shall explain in the following, this is not a trivial operation, at the point that one is frequently
forced to rely on rhythmic constraints to understand the syllabiﬁcation intended by the author.

The delicate point is the sequence of vowels, that in Italian, similarly to other European languages, can be
either pronounced as a single sound (diphthongs/triphthongs) or as separate sounds (hiatus). The phenomenon
of dieresis consists in modifying the pronunciation by reading a diphthong splitting the sounds as in a hiatus;
conversely, we have a syneresis when a hiatus is joined into a single sound.

A similar phenomenon may happen between adjacent words, respectively ending and starting with vowels.
In such a situation, we have to consider that the phono-syntactic chain in natural languages, including Italian, is
continuous. When we speak, we don’t make any pause between words. So two vowels facing each other from the
borders of two diﬀerent words normally behave just as if they belong to the same syllable. There is no hiatus. The
metric formalization of this phenomenon is called synalephe. According to the structure of the language [8, 9, 24],

in Italian poetry synalephe is the norm, providing a sort of “default” way of reading a verse. However, there are
many interesting exceptions, both in the perspective of the natural language and of the “poetic licence”, which
in Dante’s case is supposed to be almost always well motivated, and aimed to obtain special eﬀects according to
the rhythm of the verse [12, 14, 20, 21]. The anomalous hiatus between two words is called dialephe.

For all this reasons, automatic syllabiﬁcation of Italian poetry, and of Dante’s work in particular, has been
traditionally considered as a particularly challenging, almost hopeless task. We address the problem using tech-
niques from probabilistic and constraint programming to generate the most likelihood syllabiﬁcation of each
verse, delegating to experts the solution of the most controversial cases. In the current version, we are left with
a dozen problematic cases, discussed in Appendix C, whose complexity is not due to syllabiﬁcation but to the
their anomalous rhythm. The automatic identiﬁcation of these verses is in fact one of the possible applications
of our algorithm.

We believe this work may provide a base for a lot of interesting investigations. From the point of view of
Neural Networks and Deep Learning, it would be interesting to see if we can teach an agent to correctly learn
syllabiﬁcation, and then use this additional knowledge to improve automatic generation of verses in Dante’s style
(we shall extensively discuss Poetry generation in Section 3). Imposing the knowledge of the syllabic structure on
a character-base textual encoding could provide an essential insight on the role of vowels, consonants, and their
mutual interplay. It would be particularly interesting if we could distinguish (groups of) vowels and consonants
as diﬀerent clusters in the latent space of their embedding.

From the linguistic point of view, we could provide automatic support for the identiﬁcation of anomalous
situations [12], the identiﬁcation of periodic functions [7], or the classiﬁcation of verses into diﬀerent metric
categories [11] (as well as their identiﬁcation inside large corpora).

While our work is speciﬁc for Dante, the overall methodology can be easily adapted and ﬁne tuned to any

other author1.

1.1 Achievements
The syllabiﬁcation algorithm, developed in the Python language, is freely available on GitHub at the address
https://github.com/asperti/Dante. The complete syllabiﬁcation of the Comedy just takes a few seconds. The
current release contains:

• full syllabiﬁcation code;
• a copy of the Comedy’s dictionary, saved as a pickle ﬁle and accessible as a python dictionary data struc-
ture. For each word we supply information relative to its syllabiﬁcation (that in a few cases can be non
deterministic), the position of the accent, and the synalephe propensity at left and right extremities;

• source version of the Divina Commedia, borrowed from the Gutenbgerg edition (see Section 2);
• syllabiﬁed version of the full Comedy, where syllables have been divided by a vertical bar as in

Nel |mez|zo |del |cam|min |di |no|stra |vi|ta,

Inferno I, 1

1.2 Structure of the work
The article is structured in the following way. In Section 2 we mention the digital source that we adopted as a
base for our work, as well as other digital resources available on line, and their related projects. In Section 3,
we discuss related works. Since we are not aware of any other similar syllabiﬁcation eﬀort, we provide a wider
view on the state of the art in textual processing of poetry, with special emphasis on its generative modeling.
In Section 4 we discuss the syllabiﬁcation of words, that is intrinsically non deterministic. Section 5 is entirely
devoted to our approach to the synalephe, that is the main contribution of this work. In Section 6, we discuss the
structure of the dictionary, that provides, for each word, information about its syllabiﬁcation, the location of its

1Some ﬁne tuning seems to be unavoidable, since, e.g. the use of synalephe in Dante may be diﬀerent from that of Ariosto.

accent and the synalephe propensity of the word with adjacent ones. In Section 7, we outline the syllabiﬁcation
algorithm, and our management of the metric constraints. Section 8 discusses some minor amendments that we
did to the Gutenberg edition. A few problematic cases still remaining to be solved are reported in Section 9. The
ﬁnal Section 10 brieﬂy summarizes the main contributions of the work, discusses possible improvements and
hints to the many interesting research perspectives opened by this work.

A few addition material is provided in appendices. Appendix A contains, as an example, the full syllabiﬁcation
of the ﬁrst Canto of the Inferno. Appendix B contains a detailed investigation of hiatus/diphthong situations in
the Comedy. Appendix C provides the list of verses with anomalous rhythm currently identiﬁed by our algo-
rithm.

2 DIGITAL SOURCE
A lot of diﬀerent digital editions of the Divine Comedy are currently accessible on line; we mention a few
of them at the end of this section. The edition we used for our project was edited by the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation; speciﬁcally, it is the ebook n. 1012 of 2015, that is a UTF-8 revision with special 8-
bit characters of the version in the ebook n. 1000, based instead on the 7-bit ASCII character set. The Gutenberg
source seems to essentially conform to Petrocchi’s critical edition of the Comedy2 [13], used as a reference
by most of the digital editions available on line (see Section 2.1). The version provides a rich annotation with
dieresis and stresses that help the correct syllabiﬁcation of the text and the disambiguation of words. To make
an example, the word Beatrice appears 64 times in the Comedy: in 43 cases the couple of vowels “ea” constitutes
a diphthong, as in

Io son Beatrice, che ti faccio andare,

Inferno II, 70

while in the remaining 21 cases it is a hiatus, as in

tra Beatrice e te è questo muro.

Purgatorio XXVII, 36

In the above mentioned Gutenberg edition (as in Petrocchi’s one), these hiatuses have been marked with a
dieresis: Bëatrice. Not all hiatus/diphthong issues have been solved, however, as we shall see in Section 4.

As a matter of fact, our tool may provide a valuable assistance in the philological comparison of diﬀerent
editions; for instance we spotted at least one (plausible) error in the Gutenberg version, where there is a diﬀerence
with Petrocchi’s edition. It is interesting to observe that the mistake is shared by other digital versions on line,
with a possible transfer between them: hence, it would have not been revealed by a mere textual comparison.

Apart from a few minor amendments listed in Section 8, we did a single modiﬁcation to the Gutenberg text,
consisting in replacing some occurrences of single quotes with double ones in a few quotations. The reason is that
single quotes are identical to apostrophes, that as discussed in section 5.4, play a central role for syllabiﬁcation;
for this reason, it is better to avoid any confusion.

2.1 Other (re)sources
In this section, we mention just a few of the many important projects around the world providing digital editions
of the Divine Comedy.

Dante Lab http://dantelab.dartmouth.edu/. This is an on-line database of Dante’s commentators, from the
1320s to the present. It oﬀers a virtual workspace supporting the simultaneous visualization and compari-
son of diﬀerent texts. Dante Lab was supported by the Dartmouth Dante Project.

2As it is well known, no original manuscript of the Divine Comedy has survived, although there are hundreds of ancient manuscripts from
the 14th and 15th centuries. The critical edition edited by Giorgio Petrocchi [13], published in four volumes between 1966 and 1967 as part
of the National Edition of Dante’s Works, is usually reputed to be the reference landmark for the Comedy.

3 RELATED WORKS
A pioneering application of computers to metric investigations of the Divina Commedia can be found in [7],
aiming at a statistical analysis of the so called periodic functions, that is the identiﬁcation of recurrent patterns in
the position of accents inside the verse. The study, implemented in FORTRAN on a IBM 360/44, was performed
on two subsets of 1272 verses (dataset A) and 1024 verses (dataset B) extracted according to diﬀerent policies
from the Comedy. The verses in these two subsets were manually preprocessed to split them into metric units of
suitable length, as e.g.

corresponding to accents at the following positions:

1/4/2/2/2/

− + − − − + − + − + −

More recently, a similar investigation has been done by the second author in the case of the Orlando Furioso by
Ludovico Ariosto [11].

However, at the best of our knowledge, and in spite of the many projects in digital humanities focused on
Dante’s work and the Divina Commedia, some of which have been recalled in Section 2.1, no one addressed so
far the issue of automatic syllabiﬁcation, nor provided as we do, a complete syllabiﬁcation of the Comedy.

This is not at all trivial, due to the complex nature of the Italian hendecasyllable, and the sophisticated inter-
play between metric accents and synalephe. Since the objective of our study is original, our methodology and
techniques are original too, and essentially developed from scratch.

Similarly to the ﬁeld of digital humanities, there is a lot of interest, at present, on textual processing of poetic
literature in the ﬁeld of Deep Learning. Here, the ﬁnal aim is the development of good generative textual mod-
els; there is a wide perception that the additional challenges posed by meter and rhyme could possibly drive the
discovery of new techniques, fostering the development of the ﬁeld. Since the seminal work of A.Karpathy [17],
exploiting Recursive Neural Network for automatic textual generation of image captions, (see also his wondrous

blog “The Unreasonable Eﬀectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks”, where RNN are applied for the ﬁrst time
to Shakespeare’s work) there has been a lot of work on Deep Learning techniques for Natural Language Pro-
cessing (NLP), and also a speciﬁc interest on poetry, in many diﬀerent languages, comprising e.g. English [19],
Chinese [29], ancient Greek [18], and also Italian [30]. An additional source of complexity is that the problem can
be addressed at diﬀerent linguistic levels: characters, syllables, sub-words, or words. Moreover, the very notion
of rhyme, in the Italian language, cover the last part of the word from the tonic accent, requiring knowledge
about its position, and possibly ad-hoc tokenization. Works on poetry generation frequently rely on speciﬁc de-
coding procedures to generate reasonable poetry, involving selection from a set of candidate outputs [15, 23, 30].
Rhyming and metric constraints are somehow orthogonal to each other and can also be decoupled: working on
the ﬁnal word of verses, it is relatively easy to learn rhyming patterns relying e.g. on similarity matrix between
words [16].

While rhyme is usually reputed to be the main problem of poetry generation, in the case of the Italian endeca-
syllable, metric constraints are the real challenge. As we shall explain, the musicality [10] of the verse is related
to the position of stresses inside the verse, whose actual location, however, can be at some extent modiﬁed by
interpretative modulations, via dieresis and dialephe. This is precisely what makes syllabiﬁcation hard.

The ﬁrst author recently proposed automatic generation of verses in Dante’s style as a student project for his
course of Deep Learning at the University of Bologna. In spite of the state-of-the art techniques exploited by
students, comprising word embeddings [22], attention [1, 28], transformers [27] (replacing RNN in most NLP
applications), including the “light” version (117 millions parameters) of GPT2 [26], results remained modest. The
respect of endecasyllables is erratic, and understanding the rhyme structure is still problematic (jointly learning
the what and the where still seems to be an issue). There are many justiﬁcations for these modest results, starting
from the relatively small dimension of the training set. However, we believe that, in the case of Italian poetry, an
additional source of problems is the lack of suﬃcient information in the source data, that is one of the motivations
for decorating the text with the correct syllabiﬁcation, and provide the position of the accent inside the word.
This enriched information could also, at some extent, remedy to the limited dimension of the training set.

Independently from the generative task, our enriched format opens the way to a lot of interesting investi-
gations, already hinted to in the introduction, especially in relation with a combined processing of the text at
character, syllable, and word level, aimed to investigate their mutual roles.

4 SYLLABIFICATION OF WORDS
As we already recalled, the main problem of syllabiﬁcation concerns the division of groups of vowels. Speciﬁcally,
there are two main subcases, depending on whether the vowels are intra-word (hiatus/diphthong) or inter-word
(synalephe). The synalephe is by far the most interesting and complex phenomenon, and the main subject of
this research; it will be discussed in the next section. Our approach presupposes, among other things, a known,
possibly non deterministic, syllabiﬁcation of words, that we shall address in this Section.

The syllabiﬁcation of single words, even if diﬀerent from that of modern Italian, is not a really compelling
problem; however, several words require ad-hoc treatment, and the situation is further complicated by the fre-
quent occurrences of Latin words, and words that, in Dante’s style, recall the spelling of Latin language, not to
speak of the famous Provencal tercets of Arnaut Daniel (Arnaldo Daniello) in Purgatorio XIV, 140-147.

For all these reasons, we do not release a syllabiﬁcation code, but instead provide a full dictionary with the
syllabiﬁcation of each word occurring in the Divine Comedy. This syllabiﬁcation is non-deterministic, due to the
fact that a single word may be split in diﬀerent ways in diﬀerent context, for metric reasons. A typical example,
that we already discussed, is the word “Beatrice”.

A deeper investigation of hiatuses and diphthongs in the Divine Comedy is given in Appendix B. In this
section, we brieﬂy discuss a few interesting issues, that may also help to understand the facilities oﬀered by our
tool for the analysis of the document.

As we already remarked, most of the hiatus/diphthong dichotomies are solved if the Gutenberg edition, by

the use of dieresis. However,

(1) not all problems have been addressed in the text;
(2) the use of dieresis may be questionable.

Concerning the latter issue, we shall discuss a few delicate cases in Appendix B, mostly relative to the groups

of vowels “io” and “ea”.

Here we discuss a couple of the remaining hiatus/diphthong problems still present, in our opinion, in the
Gutenberg edition. In all these cases, instead of superimposing notation on the text, e.g. in the form of additional
dieresis, we exploit the intrinsic non determinism of our approach, allowing multiple syllabiﬁcations to draw upon
in a probabilistic way. It is also important to observe that all these problematic samples have been automatically
evinced by our algorithm, since syllabiﬁcation failed or was extremely unlikely.

A ﬁrst interesting case is relative to the word “creature” (creatures). Such word appears 8 times in the Divine
Comedy; invariably, the sequence of vowels “ea” is a hiatus, but for a single unfortunate verse in the Paradiso:

e queste cose pur furon creature;

Paradiso VII, 127

Unfortunately, there is no accepted notation to express syneresis, so it is convenient to address the problem
allowing a double, nondeterministic syllabiﬁcation for the word “creature”, with sensibly diﬀerent probabilities.
Some other interesting cases are the words ending with -aio (primaio, Tegghiaio4, migliaio and similar), which

are normally spelt with a hiatus “a-io”:

E questi sette col primaio stuolo
migliaia di lunari hanno punita.

Purgatorio XXIX, 145
Purgatorio XXII, 36

However, for an ancient habit in Italian poetry5, the same suﬃx can appear as monosyllabic:

Farinata e ’l Tegghiaio, che fuor sì degni
Quanto di qua per un migliaio si conta
ne lo stato primaio non si rinselva.

Inferno VI, 79
Purgatorio XIII, 22
Purgatorio, canto XIV, 66

5 SYNALEPHE
The main problem for the correct syllabiﬁcation of the Divine Comedy is the synalephe, that is the “melding”
into a single syllable of two vowels belonging to two diﬀerent, adjacent words [3, 5, 9, 21].

Our approach to the synalephe consists in associating to each extremity of a word a probability, that can be
understood as its propensity for taking part into a synalephe. This probability can be computed statistically,
computing the frequency of the phenomenon.

Since the other important metric information associated to a word is the number 𝑛 of its syllables, each word

can be schematically described as a triple

h𝑝𝑙 , 𝑛, 𝑝𝑟 i

where 𝑝𝑙 and 𝑝𝑟 are the synalephe probabilities (left, and right, respectively) and 𝑛 is the number of syllables of
the word (we will be forced to extend this basic representation with additional information).

4Tegghiaio Aldobrandi was mayor of San Gimignano and Arezzo; he fought in the battle of Montaperti (1260) as a Guelph.
5A habit which probably deals – by extension – with the monosyllabic treatment of the word “gioia” in Italian manuscripts, coming from
the key-word “joi” in provencal poetry [21], pp. 293-4

Syllabification of the Divine Comedy

The general idea is that the probability to have a synalephe between two adjacent words 𝑤1 = h𝑝 1

𝑙 , 𝑛1, 𝑝 1

𝑟 i and

𝑤2 = h𝑝 2

𝑙 , 𝑛2, 𝑝 2

𝑟 i is given by the product 𝑝 1

𝑟 𝑝 2
𝑙 .

For words starting/ending with a vowel, the (left/right) synalephe is the norm. So, in typical cases, the synale-
phe probability is 1 for vowels and 0 for consonants. For instance, the word “selva” is described by the triple
h0, 2, 1i, since it starts with a consonant, it has 2 syllables and it ends with a vowel; similarly, “oscura” is associated
with the triple h1, 3, 1i since it starts and ends with a vowel, and it contains 3 syllables.

selva
h0, 2, 1i

oscura
h1, 3, 1i

= 1. Since we have a
When we compose the two words together, the probability to have a synalephe is 𝑝 1
synalephe, in the computation of the total number of syllables we need to subtract 1 to the sum of 𝑛1 and 𝑛2, In
the above case, we have 2 + 3 − 1 = 4.

𝑟 𝑝 2
𝑙

When the probability of having a synalephe is neither 0 nor 1, we need to consider both possibilities, with
the corresponding probabilities. In the end, we shall choose the most likelihood syllabiﬁcation for the verse,
compatible with the metric constraints. In principle, the number of cases may grow exponentially with the length
of the verse. In practice, this is never a problem, since (a) relatively few words have not-categorical synalephe
probabilities and (b) the length of the verse is in any case very small.

In our dictionary of the Divine Comedy we provide left and right estimations of the synalephe probabilities

for each word.

The previous algorithm can be easily extended to take into account multiple, non deterministic syllabiﬁcation
of single words. For instance, we might be interested to associate to the word “avea” two possible representa-
tions, corresponding to the case of dipththong/hiatus (where the latter should have precedence on the former, if
compatible with the metric):

avea

ւ

h1, 2, 0.1i

ց
h1, 3, 1i

In the case of diphthong, the words contains 2 syllables, and the right synalephe is unlikely; in the case of hiatus,
the word contains 3 syllables, with deﬁnite propensity for synalephe. In the case “avea” is followed by another
word starting with a consonant, the hiatus version will typically generate verses incompatible with the metric
constraints, and the diphthong version will eventually prevail6.

5.1 Metric constraints
The main metric constraint is to have a stress on the tenth syllable. As a rough approximation, we could expect
11 syllables for each verse, but a more precise investigation eventually requires to take into account the position
of the stress inside the word. This is not a completely trivial operation in case of Dante, due to the old lexicon,
the sometimes unusual conjugation of verbs and other problems. However, in our dictionary we also provide
this auxiliary information. The “triple” of the previous section now becomes a quadruple

h𝑝𝑙 , 𝑛, 𝑎, 𝑝𝑟 i

where the new information 𝑎 is an integer in the range [-(n-1),0] expressing the position of the accent as a
negative oﬀset from the right. For example, in “carità” the oﬀset is 0, and in “Ettore” the oﬀset is -2.

The main advantage of taking accents into consideration is the fact that, in addition to the stress on the
tenth syllable, we can also add other metric constraints, for instance relative to the stress preceding the caesura,

6In the current version, we do not follow this approach for the word “avea”. We systematically treat it as a diphthong, unless if otherwise
required by the editor with a dieresis annotation.

8

• Andrea Asperti and Stefano Dal Bianco

on either the sixth or the fourth syllable (or more sophisticated patterns). Syllabiﬁcations not satisfying these
constraints can be pruned or severely penalized in their likelihood.

There is just a slight diﬃculty in expressing the constraint relative to the stress on the tenth syllable, regarding
what we may expect after the stress. If the stress is on the last word, we accept the verse even if it has more than
11 syllables, to take into account the few versi sdruccioli of the Comedy, such as:

che noi possiam ne l’altra bolgia scendere,
ch’era ronchioso, stretto e malagevole,
non da pirate, non da gente argolica.

Inferno XXIII, 32
Inferno XXIV, 62
Inferno XXVIII, 84

In general, we would be tempted to refuse any additional word after the one containing the stress in 10𝑡ℎ, but

this would rule out a few interesting cases of composed rhyme [5, 21]. For instance, in the following verse

e men d’un mezzo di traverso non ci ha

Inferno XXX, 87

the stress is on “non” and nevertheless it is followed by two additional words (counting as one, due to the
synalephe between “ci” and “ha”). If you are curious, the verse is rhyming with “oncia” and “sconcia” (sic!).

Another example is

Poi che ciascuno fu tornato ne lo

Paradiso XI, 13

(ryhiming with “cielo” and “candelo”). The accent is on “ne” (a bland proposition, by the way), followed by an
additional word.

The rule we adopt is that, after the word containing the accent on the tenth syllable (that may have arbitrary

length), we may accept additional words provided they do not trespass the total amount of 11 syllables.

5.2 The role of punctuation
As in all known metric systems, the phono-syntactic continuity is not aﬀected by punctuation marks. The pres-
ence of a punctuation mark is therefore substantially irrelevant for the purposes of the syllabiﬁcation of the
verse.

Normally, even the dot does not prevent synalephe:

per simil colpa». E più non fé parola.
fossero». Ed ei mi disse: «Il foco etterno
perduto». Ed elli: «Vedi ch’a ciò penso».
sotto la pece?». E quelli: «I’ mi partii,
diss’ io, «chi siete?». E quei piegaro i colli;

Inferno VI, 57
Inferno VIII, 73
Inferno XI, 15
Inferno XXII, 66
Inferno XXXII, 44

As a matter of fact, punctuation marks are an acquisition of modern philology, from the Renaissance onward,
when the ﬁrst publishers of printed texts faced the problem of how to reproduce the text of ancient manuscripts,
where, as it is well known, punctuation is absent, or reduced to the essential.

5.3 Diving deeper into the synalephe
The idea of associating a synalephe probability 1 to vowels and 0 to consonants is of course just a basic, rough
approximation. There are many exception to this rule and then exceptions to exceptions, leading us naturally to
a probabilistic approach.

We now investigate a few subcategories of words deserving a special treatment.

Remark It is important to remark that the following discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive analysis
of all cases of synalehpe/dialephe inside the Comedy. It is only meant to drive a reasonable initialization of

Syllabification of the Divine Comedy

the synalephe probabilities, ruling out some relatively trivial cases. The algorithm will automatically spot the
remaining problematic cases, for which probabilities can be assigned in an automatic or supervised way.

5.3.1 Words ending in an accented vowel. In the vast majority of cases, an accented ﬁnal vowel requires dialephe.
The words in the following, relatively short, list appear in the Comedy both with dialephe and synalephe (or
exclusively with synalephe7):

apparì, bontà, ché, drizzò, fé, già, là, lì, lasciò, perché, però, più, portò, ricominciò, sé, sì, tornò, turbò

Here are some examples (the ﬁrst one with synalephe, and the second one with dialephe)

portò

sì che, stracciando, ne portò un lacerto.
A Minòs mi portò; e quelli attorse

Inferno XXII, 72
Inferno XXVII, 124

perché

perché appressando sé al suo disire,
perché ardire e franchezza non hai,

Paradiso I, 7
Inferno II, 123

tornò

Noi ci allegrammo, e tosto tornò in pianto;
Così tornò, e più non volle udirmi.

Inferno XXVI, 136
Purgatorio XVI, 145

5.3.2 Words ending with a diphthong. In Dante, groups of vowels at the end of words are frequently treated as
diphthongs/triphthongs. For instance:

al pel del vermo reo che ’l mondo fóra.
del gran disio, di retro a quel condotto
che pria m’avea parlato, sorridendo
ch’uscir dovea di lui e de le rede;

Inferno XXXIV, 108
Purgatorio IV, 9
Paradiso XI, 17
Paradiso XII, 66

When a word with a potential hiatus is followed by another one starting with a vowel there is an ambiguous

situation. For instance, in the verse

tien alto lor disio e nol nasconde.

Purgatorio XXIV, 111

we could split “disio e” as “di|sio |e” or “di|si|o e”.
Menichetti [21] treats these cases and calls them diesinalefe: when the possibility of a dieresis meets the possi-
bility of a dialephe, the dialephe wins.

We privilege the diphthong also at the end of verses. So, a verse like

mentre ch’io vissi, per lo gran disio

Purgatorio XI, 86

is going to be treated as an hendecasyllable with ten syllables.

This assumption is somewhat in contrast with the Italian metric tradition, where these cases are treated as

endecasillabi piani, with eleven syllables [5, 21, 24].

However, the previous choice has essentially no impact on the metric structure of the verse, while it is sensibly
simpler from the algorithmic point of view, since the syllabiﬁcation of words becomes independent from their
position inside the verse. If required, these cases are easily recognizable and could be simply ﬁxed in a post
processing phase.

In typical cases, and coherently with the previous politics, words ending with a diphthong have no propensity

to synalephe.

7likely due to the small number of occurrences.

5.3.3 words starting with a diphthong. Similarly to the previous case, when a word start with “ia” (Iacopo, iaculi,
iattura, . . . ), “io” (Iosüè, Iove,. . . ), “ie” (ier, iernotte, . . . ), “iu” (iura, iube, Iunone, . . . ) it is not inclined to (left)
synalephe.

Examples are

«O Iacopo», dicea, «da Santo Andrea
ché se chelidri, iaculi e faree
qual diverrebbe Iove, s’elli e Marte
Chi dietro a iura e chi ad amforismi

Inferno XIII, 133
Inferno XXIV, 86
Paradiso XXVII, 14
Paradiso XI, 4

Other combinations of vowels are less evident (and less frequent, too). An interesting case is e.g. the word

“uomini”, sometimes participating in synalpehe

Li uomini poi che ’ntorno erano sparti

Inferno XX, 88

and sometimes not:

Ahi Genovesi, uomini diversi

Inferno XXXIII, 151

5.3.4 Monosyllables. Another class of words deserving a special attention is that of monosyllables. For instance,
it is known [21] that a monosyllable followed by a word starting with an accented vowel typically results in a
dialephe. However, in Dante, monosyllables frequently induce a dialephe even in diﬀerent situations, like e.g.

a chi avesse quei lumi divini
dico che arrivammo ad una landa
che alcuna virtù nostra comprenda,
punto del cerchio in che avanti s’era,

Paradiso VIII, 25
Inferno XIV, 8
Purgatorio IV, 2
Paradiso XI, 14

It is also interesting to observe that many monosyllables end with with a diphthong (mio, tuo, suo, noi, voi,
poi, cui, fui, sia, via, etc.), or are accented (già, ché, fé, già, là, più, sé, sì, etc.) so they also fall into the previous
categories.

According to our investigation, the following additional monosyllables never occur in a synalephe in the

Comedy:

Be, me, fa, fo, mo, Po, pro, qua, re, sto, te, tu, tra, tre

The following monosyllables deserves instead a probabilistic treatment (in addition to the accented words

already listed in the previous section):

a, ad, che, chi, da, e, fra, fu, io, ho, ha, ma, o, qui, se, su, va

For instance, the quadruple associated with the conjunction “e” (and), is

(*)

h.9, 1, 0, .2i

meaning that it has a high propensity to take part in a synalephe on the left and is available (but not really
inclined) to participate in a synalephe on the right. So, if there is the possibility to have a synalephe both on the
right and on the left, the left one will be eventually preferred. For instance, in the verse

che membra feminine avieno e atto,

Inferno IX, 39

the syllabiﬁcation would be “a|vie|no e|at|to” and not “a|vie|no| e at|to”.

The synalephe probalities for the words in the (*) list are very diﬀerent from each other. For instance, words like
“da”, “ma” or “fu” have very small synalephe propensity, that is typical of Dante; quoting Menichetti (translation
by the authors):

Syllabification of the Divine Comedy

•

11

Dante always has hard attack (and dialephe) after the preposition “da”. The scarce availability
of a particle for elision is in many cases an indication that it is normally followed by a hiatus
in the language, without having to be syntagmatically tonic: “Ma Amore”, four syllables.

Menichetti [21], p.338

In general, the necessity of a probabilistic approach is readily understood in view of the following observation

by Menichetti (translation by the authors):

The unstressed vowels subject to apocope or elision (“di” better than “da”, for example) and
the initial apheretizable ones (especially i-) [. . . ] bear particularly well the synalephe, and it
is instead normal that they do more than other obstacles to the dialephe. Dante, who after
the syntagmatically unstressed word “fu” almost always has dialephe (Par IX, 120), however,
has synalephe with i- (Inf IXX, 63, Inf V, 54). Thus the dialephe of Par XX, 38 assumes special
importance.

Menichetti [21], p.339

Remarkably, all verses mentioned by Menichetti are perfectly syllabiﬁed by our algorithm.

5.4 Apostrophes
An apostrophe is used to express the elision of a part of a word. Typically, the elision refers to a ﬁnal or initial
vowel, but in rare cases it may replace an entire syllable, as in “ver’ ”,“inver’ ” (towards), where the correspond-
ing full words are “verso”,“inverso”, or also delete letters inside words, as in “acco’lo” (accoilo) or “entra’mi”
(entraimi). These latter cases must be treated in a special way: in particular, the apostrophe has essentially no
eﬀect on syllabiﬁcation.

In the other cases, the apostrophe should be basically treated as a vowel. For this reason, we prefer a syllab-
iﬁcation of the form “do|v’ or” over the more grammatical “dov’ | or” (again, this can be possibly adjusted, if
required, in postprocessing). Observe that, with our encoding of words, the two forms are sensibly diﬀerent:
“do|v’ ” has two syllables and is deﬁnitely prone to synalephe; “dov’ ” has a single syllable and refuses synalephe.
Our management of the apostrophe is however a bit more sophisticated. The point is that the apostrophe
is not just expressing an elision, but frequently it is also meant to induce a synalephe in situations where, in
principle, we would not expect one.

To make an example, let us consider the following verse:

Così vid’ i’ adunar la bella scola

Inferno IV, 94

that must be syllabiﬁed as follows:

Co|sì |vi|d’ i’ a|du|nar| la| bel|la| sco|la

Inferno IV, 94

The delicate point is the synalephe between “i’” and “adunar”. In Dantes’work, the word “io” in similar situa-

tions would not generate a synalephe: consider for instance

E io a lui: «L’angoscia che tu hai
E io anima trista non son sola,
per ch’io avante l’occhio intento sbarro.

Inferno VI, 43
Inferno VI, 55
Inferno VIII, 66

The following case is symmetric:

per ch’io ’ndugiai al ﬁne i buon sospiri,

Purgatorio IV, 132

As another example let us consider the verse
E noi lasciammo lor così ’mpacciati.

to be compared e.g. with

Inferno XXII, 151

12

• Andrea Asperti and Stefano Dal Bianco

che fu al dire e al far così intero.

Purgatorio XVII, 30

For all these reasons, we deserve to the apostrophe a special treatment: in our embedding of words as tuples,
instead of the synalephe probability, we use the numerical value 2 to express the presence of an apostrophe (left
or right, respectively): a sort of super-propensity to synalephe.

6 THE DICTIONARY
An important contribution of our work is to oﬀer a digital dictionary of the Divine Comedy providing word level
syllabiﬁcation as well as the position of the stress inside the word. In addition, the dictionary gives left and right
synalephe probabilities for each word, in the sense explained in Section 5.

More speciﬁcally, the information associated with each word 𝑤 is a list of pairs (𝑡, 𝑤𝑠), where t is the metric-
tuple h𝑝𝑙 , 𝑛, 𝑎, 𝑝𝑟 i introduced in Section 5.1, and 𝑤𝑠 is the corresponding syllabiﬁcation. We remember that 𝑛 is
the number of syllables in the word, 𝑎 is the position of the accent (expressed as a negative oﬀset from the right)
and 𝑝𝑙 , 𝑝𝑟 are the synalephe probabilities for the word (left and right, respectively).

Usually the list associated with a word 𝑤 is composed by a single entry, but in a few cases we need to take

into account the possibility to have multiple, non-deterministic syllabiﬁcations.

The syllabiﬁcation of words is expressed by a string where syllables are separated by a vertical bar character

“|”.

A typical usage of our algorithm consists in overriding an entry for a given word in the dictionary for discov-
ering interesting cases of synalephe/dialephe (or also diphthong/hiatus) involving that word inside the Comedy.
Most of the examples in this article have been obtained in that way.

7 THE VERSE SYLLABIFICATION ALGORITHM
We process a verse as a sequence of tokens 𝑤1, . . . , 𝑤𝑛. Tokens can be words or punctuation symbols; however,
as explained in Section 5.2 punctuation symbols play essentially no role and can be neglected.
Remarkably, the only information we need for each word is its metric tuple h𝑝𝑙 , 𝑛, 𝑎, 𝑝𝑟 i.
Suppose we already processed some initial part of the verse, up to token 𝑖. The information we have (the
current state, in computer science terminology), is expressed in a list of possible syllabiﬁcations up the current
token, where each syllabiﬁcation is enriched with information regarding its likelihood 𝑝, the current number of
syllables, and the synalephe probability of its last word.

To make an example, consider the simple verse
Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita.

Inferno I, 1

and suppose that we already processed the initial part of the verse up to, say, the word “cammin”. The current
state would be described by the following tuple

(|Nel |mez|zo |del |cam|min
,
|                            {z                            }
syllabiﬁcation

,

1
|{z}
likelihood

,

6
|{z}
syll. no.

)
0
|{z}
𝑝𝑟

The ﬁrst element is the actual syllabiﬁcation; the second element is its likelihood, that in this case is 1, since it is
deterministic (and hence unique), the third element is the current number of syllables, that in this case is 6, and
the ﬁnal one is the synalephe propensity of the last word “cammin”, that is 0.

If we had multiple possible syllabiﬁcations, their likelihood would be distributed among them.
Suppose now we process the next token “di”. We just need to take into account the possibility of a synalephe.
In this case it is 0 because both adjacent words exclude it, so we add a syllable separator, concatenate the syl-
labiﬁcation of the word “di” (obtained form the dictionary) to the current syllabiﬁcation of the verse, update the

Syllabification of the Divine Comedy

•

13

number of syllables, and remember the synalephe probability 𝑝𝑙 of the last word “di”. So, the new state will be:

(|Nel |mez|zo |del |cam|min |di, 1, 7, ?)

The probability of having a synalephe between two adjacent words with synalephe probabilities 𝑝𝑟 and 𝑝𝑙 (left
and right, respectively) is just the product between the two probabilities, namely 𝑝𝑟 𝑝𝑙 . In case one of 𝑝𝑟 or 𝑝𝑙 is
2 (corresponding to an apostrophe, see Section 5.4), than the resulting probability is 1, independently from the
other.

If the probability 𝑝 of having a synalephe is not categorical (0 or 1), we need to consider both possibilities,
where the respective likelihood is the product between the current verse likelihood and the probability of the
case under consideration (𝑝 for synalephe and 1 − 𝑝 for absence of synalephe).

Let us discuss a slightly more complex example, considering the verse

esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte

Inferno I, 5

We have no problems up to the ﬁrst “e”, where the state is

(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia, 1, 7, 1)

Remember that the tuple for the word “e” is h.9, 1, 0, .2. So, after processing “e” we have two possibilities:

(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e, .9, 7, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e, .1, 8, .2)

The left synalephe probability for “aspra” is 1, so, for both states, the probability to have a synalephe is .2. After
processing “aspra” we end up with 4 possible states, listed according to their probabilities

(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e |a|spra, .72, 9, 1)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e a|spra, .18, 8, 1)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e |a|spra, .08, 10, 1)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e a|spra, .02, 8, 1)

After processing the next “e” we get 8 possible states:

(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e |a|spra e, .648, 9, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e a|spra e, .162, 8, 1)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e |a|spra |e, .072, 10, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e |a|spra e, .072, 10, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e a|spra |e, .018, 9, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e a|spra e, .018, 9, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e |a|spra |e, .008, 11, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e a|spra |e, .002, 10, .2)

The processing of the last word “forte” does not introduce additional non determinism, so we end up with the 8
possible states listed below. However, only 3 of them are formed by 11 syllables, while the others (emphasized

14

• Andrea Asperti and Stefano Dal Bianco

in red) are not admissible:

(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e |a|spra e |for|te, .648, 11, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e a|spra e |for|te, .162, 10, 1)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e |a|spra |e |for|te, .072, 12, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e |a|spra e |for|te, .072, 12, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e a|spra |e |for|te, .018, 11, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e a|spra e |for|te, .018, 11, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e |a|spra |e |for|te, .008, 13, .2)
(|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia |e a|spra |e |for|te, .002, 12, .2)

Among the remaining possibilities with eleven syllables we choose the most likely, that is

|e|sta |sel|va |sel|vag|gia e |a|spra e |for|te

This choice is consistent with the prosody of Italian language, considering both the strong propensity of “e” to
left synalephe (“selvaggia e”, “aspra e”), and the propensity to natural hiatus between monosyllables and accented
vowel (“e aspra”).

7.1 Management of Metric constraints
For the reasons we already explained, instead of relying on the total number of syllables, it is better to rely on
metric constraints. The most important one is to have a stress on the 10th syllable: if a syllabiﬁcation does not
satisfy this constraint it can be pruned. Additionally, we (currently) consider the constraint of having either a
stress on the 6th or on the 4th syllable. More sophisticated constraints can be easily integrated in the algorithm.
In order to avoid to reprocess the entire verse, we add to each state a small list of boolean ﬂags a4,a6,a10
expressing the presence of an accent at the corresponding position. The ﬂag is initialized to False, and set to
True if we ﬁnd an accent on the expected syllable. In the current version, we accept accents independently from
the grammatical category of the word (an information that we do not have in our vocabulary yet). We only
reserve a special treatment to some monosyllables, mostly articles and prepositions, that we do not accept as
legal accents.

The constraint on the tenth syllable is mandatory; for the other metric constraints, the algorithm privileges
syllabiﬁcations satisfying either the stress in 4th or the stress in 6th, raising a warning if none of them is found.
The verses raising a warning are just a dozen, and are commented in AppendixC; none of them is problematic
from the point of view of the syllabiﬁcation.

8 AMENDMENTS TO THE GUTENBERG EDITION
The verse

e suol di state talor essere grama.

Inferno XX, 81

contains 12 syllables. Following Petrocchi [13], we amend it as follows:

e suol di state talor esser grama.

Inferno XX, 81

It is interesting to observe that the previous mistake is common to several on line versions (at the time of sub-

mission), comprising e.g. https://divinacommedia.weebly.com/inferno-canto-xx.html, or https://www.hs-augsburg.de/ harsch/italica/Cronologia/secolo14/Dante/dan_d120.html
and many others.

8.1 Minor modifications
In the verse,

Tesëo combatter co’ doppi petti;

Purgatorio XXIV, 123

Syllabification of the Divine Comedy

•

15

we added a tonic accent on “combattér” (short for “combatterono”), to distinguish it from the inﬁnite form “com-
bàtter” in e.g.

licenza di combatter per lo seme

Paradiso XII, 95

In the verse,

ch’io drizzava spesso il viso in vano.

Purgatorio IX, 84

“ch’io” must be split into two syllables, while it is usually a single one. By analogy with similar situations in the
document, we added a diereris: “ch’ïo”.

9 PROBLEMATIC CASES
There still remain a few problematic (and debated) cases. The source of complexity is well described by Beccaria
[3] in his discussion of the “dialephe” entry for the Enciclopedia Dantesca Treccani (translation by the authors):

Indeed, Dante felt deeply in the verse, especially in the Comedy, the rhythmic and logical values
(more than melodic ﬂuidity). The dialephe, even of the less usual type in the Comedy, seems in fact
very often determined by the pause of thought [. . . ] and special artistic justiﬁcations were also found
[12] (Casella) for slow narrative scans, underlined by dialephe before conjunctions.

It is remarkable to observe that most of the examples cited by Beccaria are automatically handled by our approach.
For instance in the verse

d’infanti e di femmine e di viri

Inferno IV, 30

the dialephe after the word “infanti” (children) is imposed by the requirement of a stress on the 6𝑡ℎ syllable.

Similarly, in

era già grande, e già eran tratti

Paradiso XVI, 107

the dialephe after “grande” (big) is required in order to have a stress on the 10𝑡ℎ syllable. The most problematic
cases are related to the heuristic rule of detaching hemistics starting with an unstressed vowel in slow-scanned
verses dealing with enumerations [3].

We just mention the couple of cases that, according to this rule, are incorrectly classiﬁed by our algorithm
(as far as we have been able to check); for these verses, we give the syllabiﬁcation produced by our algorithm
(former) and the “canonical” one (latter):

ma |sa|pï|en|za, a|mo|re| e |vir|tu|te
ma |sa|pï|en|za, |a|mo|re e |vir|tu|te

leg|ge, |mo|ne|ta, of|ﬁ|cio |e |co|stu|me
leg|ge, |mo|ne|ta, |of|ﬁ|cio e |co|stu|me

Inferno I, 104

Purgatorio VI, 146

Dealing with these remaining cases is an interesting challenge for future developments of our works. However,
it is also worth to remark that it is precisely the somewhat anomalous behaviour of these verses that make them
interesting from a linguistic point of view. So, the diﬀerence between the intended syllabiﬁcation and the most
likely one produced by our algorithm is per se an interesting phenomenon, worth to be observed and investigated
more than simply corrected.

10 CONCLUSIONS
We give, for the ﬁrst time, a complete syllabiﬁcation of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The interest of
the work from the cultural heritage point of view is, in our opinion, evident: we enrich the source document

16

• Andrea Asperti and Stefano Dal Bianco

with an information that can be directly processed in a lot of diﬀerent and innovative ways, and for diﬀerent
purposes. We enrich data, do not provide processing frameworks or applications.

Our syllabiﬁcation algorithm, based on techniques borrowed from probabilistic and constraint programming,
is simple and eﬀective. It is not meant to mimic or reﬂect correct metric or phonetic rules: many of ours “admis-
sible” syllabiﬁcations are totally incorrect from a metric point of view: we simply rule them out as unlikely. Our
probabilistic approach could actually open new perspectives about the digital investigation of phonetic rules,
and their empirical justiﬁcation, especially in view of automatic learning.

While our work has been focused on the Divina Commedia, due to the world-wide interest on this document,
the overall approach may be extended to most of the Italian poetic literature. The most delicate issue is the
extension of the dictionary; in particular, it is not evident if the synalephe propensities generalize to diﬀerent
authors, and to what extent (that seems to be by itself a very interesting topic).

There are a few limitations of our approach, that can be possibly addressed in future works. A weak point, that
could cause problems in some situations, is that the synalephe probabilities associated with words are context
independent. Another interesting perspective, partially related to the previous point, consists in taking into ac-
count more sophisticated phonetic categories (semivowels, approximants, . . . ). The management of punctuation
symbols could be revisited in view of the issues in Section 9. Finally, as discussed in Section 7.1, the identiﬁca-
tion of the rhythmic cadence of a verse could take advantage of the grammatical category of words, that is an
information currently missing from the vocabulary.

A SYLLABIFICATION OF INFERNO, CANTO I
We recall our conventions:

• group of vowels in the ﬁnal word of the verse are treated as diphthongs (tro|vai, in|trai, ab|ban|do|nai, . . . )
• apostrophes are assimilated to vowels: (on|d’io, do|v’or, . . . )

B HIATUSES AND DIPHTHONGS IN THE DIVINE COMEDY
In this appendix, we provide a more exhaustive discussion about the syllabiﬁcation of words in the Divine
Comedy. The main purpose of this Section is to highlight the complexity of the problem and the diﬀerences with
respect to the syllabiﬁcation of modern Italian. The most interesting cases have been anticipated in Section 4;
here we discuss a few additional issues regarding the use of hiatuses and diphthongs in the Divine Comedy. We
organize the discussion around the most problematic combination of vowels: ia, ie, io, ea.

From a linguistic point of view, our discussion may actually appear over simplistic; actually, the presentation
is mostly given from a computational perspective, and inﬂuenced by the current version of the algorithm. In
particular, at the moment, we have no information about the position of the accent in a combination of vowels
(this could be taken into account in future versions). In fact, in Italian poetry (and natural language) we can
distinguish three situations:

(1) when the accent falls on the second vowel (ascendent nexus, es. patri-àrca, ri-òne, disi-àre) normally we
have a hiatus (but never in the frequent cases of words coming in Florentine from the Latin PL: pieno from
PLENUS, and in some other circumstances of real diphthongs [21]);

(2) when the accent falls on the ﬁrst vowel (descendent nexus, es. farìa, ìo, mìo, arpìa, corsìa) the nexus is

more often monosyllabic;

(3) when both vowels are out of accent (unstressed nexus, es. accìdia, ambròsia, viaggiàre, trionfàre) the situ-

ation is far more complicated, but in poetry prevails the hiatus [21].

i-a

B.1
The vowel “i” followed by “a”, that typically constitutes a diphthong in modern Italian, is frequently a hiatus in
the Divine Comedy (especially in the middle of words). A couple of frequent and relatively simple cases are the
following:

viaggio

“A te convien tenere altro viaggio”,

Inferno, I, 91

Other occurrences are in Inferno, X, 132; Inferno XVI, 27; Inferno XXVIII, 16; Inferno XXXI, 82; Purgatorio,
II, 92.

disiata similarly to “disiato”, “disiando”, “disiar”,“disianza”, etc.

Vostra parola disiata vola,

Purgatorio I, 83

Other occurrences are in Inferno V, 133; Inferno XXX, 140, Purgatorio III, 40, Purgatorio XXIX, 5; Purgato-
rio XXIX, 33; Purgatorio XXXIII, 83; Paradiso III, 73; , Paradiso V, 86; Paradiso XV, 66;; Paradiso XXII, 18;
Paradiso XXII, 65; Paradiso XXIII, 4; Paradiso XXIII, 14; Paradiso XXIII, 39; Paradiso XXX, 15;

Other words that contain a ia-hiatus are:

Syllabification of the Divine Comedy

•

23

accidia, ambrosia, Anﬁarao, anzian, Briareo, eresiarche, celestiali, Ciriatto, clementiae, convertian, disia, dis-
viando, disviato, Fialte, giovial, gloriar, gloriarla, gratia, Grazian, inebriate, India, inebriate, inebriava, ’nvetri-
ate, inviasti, Iustiniano, Labia, lilia, Madian, mandrian, Mariza, Marsia, meridian, meridiana, Oriaco, Polinmia,
potenziata, radial, radiando, Rialto, scienzia, scuriada, spezial, storiata, straniasse, sustanzial, svia, sviando, sviati,
triangol, Trivia, umiliato, variar, variazion, venian, Vitaliano, Zodiaco

More complex is the case of the following words, sometimes pronounced with a hiatus, and sometimes with
a diphthong. For each word, we provide an example of the two possibilities (we use a dieresis to remark the
diﬀerence)

ﬁate,ﬁata

patria:

infamia

venian

celestial

gloria

spesse fïate ragioniam del monte
se mille ﬁate in sul capo mi tomi.

Purgatorio XXII, 104
Inferno XXXII, 102

di quella nobil patrïa natio,
e non molto distanti a la tua patria,

Inferno X, 26
Paradiso XXI, 107

l’infamïa di Creti era distesa
sanza tema d’infamia ti rispondo.

Inferno XII, 12
Inferno XXVII, 66

e non pareva, sì venïan lente.
che venian lungo l’argine, e ciascuna

Purgatorio III, 60
Inferno XV, 17

celestïal giacer, da l’altra parte,
Da poppa stava il celestial nocchiero,

Purgatorio XII, 29
Purgatorio II, 43

‘Glorïa in excelsis’ tutti ‘Deo’
de la mia gloria e del mio paradiso

Purgatorio XX, 136
Paradiso XV, 36

Although the sequence i-a frequently constitutes a hiatus, this is not a norm. In the frequent case in which
the accent is on the second vowel, we have a natural diphthong. Examples, just borrowed from the ﬁrst canto,
are: pianeta, piaggia, piange, bestia, Troia, noia, gioia, Italia.

i-e

B.2
The two vowels “ie” form a hiatus in the following words:

Ariete, audienza, balbuziendo, coscienza, Daniel, Daniello, dieta, esperienza, esuriendo, Ezechiel, Gabriel, Gabriello,

Galieno, ’nvieranno, niente, odierno, oriental, oriente, Ostiense, pazienza, pietate, progenie, quieta, quietar, qui-
etarmi, quietata, quiete, quieto, quietò, requievi, riempion, riesca, sapienza, scienza, scienzia, Siestri .

The two vowels “ie” may be a hiatus in the following words:

pieta/pietate

con buona pïetate aiuta il mio!
In te misericordia, in te pietate,

Purgatorio V, 87
Paradiso XXXIII, 19

obediendo/disobediendo

con umiltate obedïendo poi
quanto disobediendo intese ir suso;

Paradiso VII, 99
Paradiso VII, 100

suﬃciente/suﬃcienti

24

• Andrea Asperti and Stefano Dal Bianco

acciò che re suﬃcïente fosse;
per far l’uom suﬃciente a rilevarsi

Paradiso XIII, 96
Paradiso VII, 116

Examples of natural dipththongs from the ﬁrst Canto are: pensier, pien, ﬁera, volontieri, miei, convien, empie,

Pietro, dietro.

i-o

B.3
The two vowels “io” are a hiatus in the following words:

accidioso, Anﬁone, anterior, aspersion, Caliopè, Curio, Diogenès, Diomede, Dione, Dionisio, disio, disioso, divi-
sion, elezion, elezione, elezioni, Eliodoro, Etiopia, Etiopo, furiosa, gaudiose, gaudioso, Gerion, Gerione, gloriosa,
gloriosamente, glorioso, gloriosi, idioma, Iperione,lioncel, Livio, lussuriosa, Niobè, oblivion, oppinion, oppinione,
Pigmalione, pio, piorno, presunzion, preziosa, prezioso, razionabile, region, religione, Scariotto, Scipion, Scipione,
settentrion, settentrional, studiose, violenta, violenti, viole, violenza, vision, visione,

The two vowels “io” may be a hiatus in the following words:
conversione

La mia conversïone, omè!, fu tarda;
e per trovare a conversione acerba

Purgatorio XIX, 106
Paradiso XI, 103

distinzione

sanza distinzïone in essordire.

Paradiso XXIX, 30
Paradiso XIII, 116

grazioso

ditemi, ché mi ﬁa grazioso e caro,

Inferno V, 88
Purgatorio XIII, 91

invidiosa/invidiosi

silogizzò invidïosi veri.

orazion/orazione

se buona orazïon lui non aita,
così, a l’orazion pronta e divota,

Paradiso X, 138
Inferno XV, 68

Purgatorio XI, 130
Paradiso XIV, 22

quand’ ira o altra passïon ti tocca!
a la passion di che ciascun si spicca,

Inferno XXXI, 72
Purgatorio XXI, 107

perfezion/perfezione

di tutta l’animal perfezïone;
sanza sua perfezion fosser cotanto.

Paradiso XIII, 83
Paradiso XXIX, 45

The cases of the two words “mio” (my) and “io” (I) possibly deserves a little discussion.
The word “mio” occurs 310 times in the Divine Comedy, and in 307 cases it must be read as a single syllable.

Let us brieﬂy review the remaining three cases, namely

ma quella folgorò nel mïo sguardo
Tal vero a l’intelletto mïo sterne
già tutta mïo sguardo avea compresa,

Paradiso III, 128
Paradiso XXVI, 37
Paradiso XXXI, 53

These verses are discussed in [21], p.250, who remarks the relation with the spurious s- following “mïo”. Actually,
the ancient Florentine language still maintains the prostesi in many cases (“iscritto”, “isguardo”, . . . ); the potential
prostesi, helps the separation of the previous nexus.

Syllabification of the Divine Comedy

•

25

The case of “io” (I) is even more problematic. In the Gutenberg edition, we have 28 occurrences of “ïo”, versus
679 occurrences of “io”. Due to the synalephe, in most of the cases the two forms “io/ïo” would not change
neither the total number of syllables, nor the position of tonic stresses inside the verse. The hiatus “ïo” may look
closer to the Latin etymology “ego”, but in the frequent cases when synalephe is impossible, it is clear that “io”
normally constitutes a single syllable. Some examples are:

rispuos’ io lui con vergognosa fronte.
tu se’ solo colui da cu’ io tolsi
Io non posso ritrar di tutti a pieno,
e di questi cotai son io medesmo.
Io venni in loco d’ogne luce muto,

Nevertheless, there are situations where a hiatus is imposed for metric reasons. A nice example is the following

verse, where the two forms coexists:

Cred’ ïo ch’ei credette ch’io credesse

Inferno XIII, 25

Let us also observe that shifting the hiatus on the second occurrence of “io” would not change the total number
of syllables. However, the hiatus on the ﬁrst occurrence allows us to have a stress on the 6𝑡ℎ syllable, in “credètte”,
and is eventually correct. This is a clear indication that for the correct syllabiﬁcation of verses relying on the
stress in 10𝑡ℎ is not enough.

The linguistic motivation to privilege the dieresis on the ﬁrst occurrence of “io” is that, coming after its verb,

it is under stress and produces a more natural dieresis [21].

e-a

B.4
The group “ea” is the one where the use of dieresis in the Gutenberg edition is more questionable.

The word “ideale” is expressed with dieresis, but this looks somehow redundant.
Apart from a few proper names (Beatrice, Enea, Rea, Rodopea, Tarpea, . . . ) the remaining cases are verbs at

the imperfect:

avea, avean, correan, dicea, discendea, discernea, dovea, facea, facean, giacea, imprendea, intendea, parea,

parean, percoteansi, piacea, piangea, potea, potean, ravvolgea, reﬂettea, sapean, solea, tenea, vedea, vincea.

In all these verbs, “ea” may constitute both a hiatus or a diphthong (where the latter is, by far, the norm). We

give a few examples

avea

avean

ﬁso nel punto che m’avëa vinto.
ma l’un de’ cigli un colpo avea diviso.

Paradiso XXIX, 9
Purgatorio III, 108

udito avëan l’ultimo costrutto;
Non avean penne, ma di vispistrello

Purgatorio XXVIII, 147
Inferno XXXIV, 49

correa/correan

corrëan genti nude e spaventate,
e correa contro ’l ciel per quelle strade

Inferno XXIV, 92
Purgatorio XVIII, 79

dovea

facea

Sì com’ io fui, com’ io dovëa, seco,
lo qual dovea Penelopè far lieta,

Purgatorio XXXIII, 22
Inferno XXVI, 96

ch’io facëa dinanzi a la risposta,
sì che ’l sangue facea la faccia sozza,

parean

piangea

e or parëan da la bianca tratte,
Morti li morti e i vivi parean vivi:

Purgatorio XXIX, 12
Purgatorio XII, 67

Io non piangëa, sì dentro impetrai:
quando piangea, vi facea far le grida.

Inferno XXXIII, 49
Inferno XIV, 102

However, there are a few cases where Petrocchi’s use of dieresis looks somehow abused. Consider for instance

the following verses:

Ella non ci dicëa alcuna cosa,
che ’l cibo ne solëa essere addotto

Purgatorio VI, 64
Purgatorio XXXIII, 44

As a matter of fact, there is no reason to expect synalephe in these cases (and hence no reason add a dieresis),
precisely because the words on the left end with a diphthong. This is a case of the already mentioned diesinalefe
rule by Menichetti: when the possibility of a dieresis meets the possibility of a dialephe, the dialephe prevails.

The words discendea, discernea, giacea, intendea, piacea, ravvolgea, reﬂettea, tenea, vedea and vincea, as well

as many occurrences of other verbs at the imperfect are in a similar situation.

A very interesting case is

che non parëa s’era laico o cherco.

Inferno XVIII, 117

We accept Petrocchi’s diﬃcult choice to suggest an exceptional dieresis on “parëa” because there are no el-
ements (rithmical, linguistical, nor according to Dante’s usus scribendi) to privilege other solutions, equally
exceptional:

che |non |pa|rea |s’e|ra |lä|i|co o |cher|co
che |non |pa|rea |s’e|ra |lai|co |o |cher|co

Lai|co (normally bisyllabic) could support an exceptional dieresis thanks to the Greek LAÏKÓS, Latin LÄICUS.

While parëa can rely on the alternative frequent forms of the imperfect in -eva (pa|re|va).

C ANOMALOUS VERSES
There are just a dozen of cases in the Divine Comedy where the syllabiﬁcation algorithm is raising a warning
due to the absence of an accent on either the 4th or the 6th syllable. We have been glad to discover that all of
them have been treated and discussed in the secular literary-critical tradition.

When an adverb in -mente is involved, we can enforce a secondary stress on the ﬁrst component of the

compound word (canìna-mente, miràbil-mente, glorïòsa-mente):

Inferno VI, 14
Inferno XXI, 6
Paradiso XI, 12
and a similar hypothesis (sustàn-zïàl from sustànza) can be advanced for

con tre gole caninamente latra
e vidila mirabilmente oscura.
cotanto glorïosamente accolto.

Ogne forma sustanzïal, che setta

Purgatorio XVIII, 49

The remaining verses are just considered as hendecasyllables with anomalous accentuation (2nd and 8th, or 3rd
and 8th syllable):
