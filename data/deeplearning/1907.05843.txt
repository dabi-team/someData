Abstract 

An energy-efficient voltage controlled domain wall device for implementing an artificial 
neuron  and  synapse  is  analyzed  using  micromagnetic  modeling  in  the  presence  of  room 
temperature thermal noise. By controlling the domain wall motion utilizing spin transfer or spin 
orbit  torques  in  association  with  voltage  generated  strain  control  of  perpendicular  magnetic 
anisotropy in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, different positions of the domain 
wall  are  realized  in  the  free  layer  of  a  magnetic  tunnel  junction  to  program  different  synaptic 
weights.  The  feasibility  of  scaling  of  such  devices  is  assessed  in  the  presence  of  thermal 
perturbations that compromise controllability. Additionally, an artificial neuron can be realized by 
combining  this  DW  device  with  a  CMOS  buffer.  This  provides  a  possible  pathway  to  realize 
energy efficient voltage controlled nanomagnetic deep neural networks that can learn in real time.

Introduction 

There has been considerable recent progress in the development of dedicated CMOS processors for 
neuromorphic computing such as IBM’s TrueNorth that can implement 1 million spiking neurons and 256 
million  configurable  synapses  [1]  while  consuming  ~70mW  power.  However,  these  neuromorphic 
processors have drawbacks such as lack of onboard (real-time) learning/training. More importantly, they 
have poor energy efficiency in comparison to the human brain, which has ~ 100 billion neurons and ~ 500 
trillion  synapses  and  consumes  a  mere  ~  20  watts  of  power  [2].  Thus,  a  key  challenge  for  hardware 
implementation of artificial neural networks lies in finding energy efficient hardware implementations of 
neurons and non-volatile synapses whose weights can be changed easily and deterministically with very 
little energy as the network learns from data in real time. While artificial neurons and synapses have been 
proposed  using  current-controlled  nanomagnets  [3-9]  and  memristors  [10-15]  that  are  potentially  more 
energy efficient than pure CMOS implementations, there is still room for increasing the energy efficiency.   

We  propose  implementing  energy  efficient  artificial  synapse  using  a  magnetic  tunnel  junction 
(MTJ). The free layer of the MTJ comprises a magnetostrictive nanowire racetrack made of CoFe or CoFeB 
for example. Here we model the magnetization dynamics of the domain walls in the racetrack. The wall is 
driven through the racetrack clocked with current passing through the racetrack exerting a spin transfer 
torque (STT) [16-19], or by spin orbit torque (SOT) due to current flowing in a heavy metal layer directly 
underneath  the  racetrack  [20-23].  The  heavy  metal  layer  leads  to  a  perpendicular  magnetic  anisotropy 
(PMA) in the CoFeB layer, and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) which stabilizes chiral domain 
walls. In order to achieve controlled positioning of the DW we  propose current clocked DW  motion in 
conjunction with a gradient in the PMA [24, 25]. Notches are placed at regular intervals to arrest the DW 
at  different  locations  of  the  racetrack.  For  the  SOT-clocked  DW  motion  [23,  26-28]  instead  of  using  a 
notched race track and PMA gradient, a racetrack of uniform width is used along with modulation of the 
PMA at regular intervals. This modulation (PMA reduction) creates a barrier to the motion of the DW, 
arresting the DW at different locations depending on the voltage applied. We also describe the manner in 
which this device, in combination with a CMOS buffer, can also function as a neuron and implement Deep 
Neural Networks (DNNs). Such an implementation is important in applications where energy efficiency is 
at a premium, such as medical processors and sensor networks that need to learn from data in real time 
rather than be trained offline, and where synaptic weights of limited accuracy are sufficient [29].  

Section II describes the working principle of the device and our micromagnetic modeling approach. 
Section III presents and discusses simulation of the DW dynamics in the presence of PMA gradients and 
STT/SOT  while  Section  IV  compares  the  energy  efficiency  of  this  approach  with  other  spintronic  and 
memristor approaches.

II.  Device working principle and micromagnetic modeling approach 

The working principle of the device (Fig. 1) is explained in terms of the DW dynamics within the 
magnetic free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). The resistance of the MTJ, which consists of a 
free layer, a tunnel junction and a fixed layer pinned by a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF), varies with the 
location of the DW in the free layer. Therefore, the DW position determines the non-volatile resistance 
states of the spintronic synapse and can be programed by a voltage, as described below. As the Deep Neural 
Network (DNN) learns from data in real time, a backpropagation algorithm [30] implemented on a CMOS 
application-specific co-processor can calculate the new weights for different synapses and output these as 
specific programming voltages (not addressed in this paper). These voltages should be able to reprogram 
the resistance states of the synapses to update their resistance values, as described in this work. 

Clocking: Consider a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy racetrack consisting of a heavy metal/ferromagnet 
bilayer that could be deposited a piezoelectric film to realize our proposed device as shown in Fig. 1. Such 
a bilayer (e.g. Pt/CoFe) derives its PMA from interfacial effects and exhibits significant DMI that stabilizes 
the formation of chiral Néel domain walls [23].  

SOT clock: SOT acting on the magnetization is generated when current flows in the heavy metal layer. 
The damping like field (DL-field) thus produced is responsible for translating the Néel domain wall in the 
ferromagnetic  layer  [23].  Reversing  the  direction  of  the  current  in  the  Pt  layer  reverses  the  direction  of 
domain wall motion, resets the domain wall position, and hence resets the resistance of the DW MTJ device.  

Fig. 1.  Schematic of the spintronic DW-synapse. (a) Top view showing a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) stack 
placed adjacent to an electrode on a piezoelectric substrate. The inset shows the PMA as a function of distance 
along the free layer when a voltage is applied to the strain electrode. (b) Front view of the stack (top panel). In 
the bottom panel, which shows just the heavy metal/free layer, the electrons on the top surface of the Pt are spin 
polarized into the plane of the figure and electrons at the bottom are spin polarized out of the plane of the figure 
due to the spin Hall effect.

  STT clock: Alternatively, for current clocking by spin transfer torque, electrons passing through 
the domain wall are preferentially polarized along the magnetization orientation of the region through which 
they pass and exert a torque on the magnetization of the subsequent region they enter [16-19]. This causes 
the spins within the wall to rotate thus initiating a domain wall motion in the direction of the electron flow.   

SOT vs. STT clock: When CoFe is used with a heavy metal (Pt) underlayer that leads to PMA and 
DMI, the ratio of the current flowing through the CoFe that leads to STT and to the current flowing through 
the Pt that leads to SOT depends inversely on the ratio of their resistances. Rather than consider the case of 
mixed STT and SOT, we consider the two extreme cases: pure SOT and pure STT in our simulations to 
understand the domain wall  motion with these two clocking mechanisms. We also study the  manner in 
which the DW can be arrested in a specific region of the racetrack by applying a voltage-induced strain 
under these two different clocking mechanisms.  

Voltage control of domain wall position: Stopping the domain wall at a specific position along 
the racetrack is accomplished by applying a voltage to the side electrode (Fig 1(a)) while the DW is being 
“clocked” by SOT or STT. Consider a domain wall that has been “reset” to one end of the racetrack and is 
moved along the racetrack towards the other end in Fig. 1 (a) by SOT from a current in the adjacent Pt layer 
or by STT from a charge current through the free layer. Application of a voltage between the side electrode 
and  the  bottom  contact  of  the  piezoelectric  layer  produces  an  electric  field  through  the  piezoelectric 
thickness, which in turn produces an in-plane stress in the manner described in Ref [31]. This leads to a 
local strain gradient in the piezoelectric, which is transferred to the ferromagnetic layer, altering its PMA 
as shown in Fig. 1(a). A modified scheme as shown in Fig 4 can also be used as discussed later.  

The mechanism of generation of the strain gradient is explained in detail in Fig. 2. When a voltage 
is applied to the top electrode, a local electric field is generated through the thickness of the piezoelectric 
between the area directly underneath the top electrode area and the bottom electrode. This causes an out of 
plane expansion of the piezoelectric and consequently an in-plane contraction (due to Poisson’s ratio) of 
the area below the top electrode. This produces a tensile in-plane strain in the region of the piezoelectric 
immediately adjoining the electrode, with a magnitude decreasing with distance away from the electrode. 
This creates a strain gradient as shown in Fig. 2, upper schematic.  While a similar strain gradient is created 
in  the  in-plane  direction  orthogonal  to  that  shown  in  the  figure,  we  are  only  concerned  with  the  strain 
gradient along the DW MTJ device. Furthermore, if the piezoelectric is deposited on a stiff substrate, the 
bottom of the piezoelectric is clamped but the top part of the piezoelectric can experience the in-plane strain 
gradient.  

Fig. 2. A schematic showing the strain gradient produced on the DW MTJ when a voltage is applied to the 
top strain electrode. The in-plane tensile strain decreases from the right end of the DW MTJ to the left producing a 
PMA gradient.

The benefit of this scheme is that the piezoelectric film develops a strain gradient even though it is 
not patterned provided the in-plane dimension of the electrode is approximately equal to the thickness of 
the  film  [31].  The  strain  gradient  will  be  most  significant  within  a  distance  of  one  to  two  times  the 
piezoelectric film thickness [31]. This in-plane strain in turn modulates the perpendicular anisotropy of the 
soft layer and provides a spatial variation of the energy landscape of the Néel DW in the racetrack. 

Thus, the device relies on stress generated by the electrode to arrest the SOT/STT-induced motion of the 
DW, leaving the DW pinned at a notch or a specific location where there is a PMA barrier (Fig 4, discussed 
later). The strain and therefore modulation of PMA is largest at the left end, and minimum at the right end 
(Fig 2). This PMA gradient in conjunction with the torque on the DW and notches patterned in the wire 
determines the position where the DW is arrested.  

Micromagnetic model: Mumax [32] was used to perform simulations of the domain wall dynamics 
using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation in the presence of thermal noise at room temperature.

by modulating (cid:1837)(cid:3048)(cid:2869) according to Eq. (2). We assume (cid:1837)(cid:3048)(cid:2870) (cid:3404) 0, as we are not dealing with textured or single 
crystal materials [35]. 

Thermal noise is modeled by a random, effective magnetic field (Hthermal) applied in the manner 
described in [36, 37] within the micromagnetic framework [32]. Furthermore, the field-like and damping-
like SOTs and the STT due to charge current are modeled with the appropriate terms [32, 38] assuming 
polarization=1, Slonczewski parameter Λ=1 and secondary spin-torque parameter έ=0. In our simulations,

we do not consider STT and SOT at the same time. Instead, we present two cases: one in which only STT 
is considered and the other in which only SOT is considered.  This leads to an understanding of the clocking 
of  DW  motion  and  its  arrest  at  a  specific  positions  using  voltage  induced  strain  for  these  two  different 
clocking mechanisms. 

 The  discretization  cell  sizes  used  for  the  simulations  were  4nm×4nm×1nm  and  the  material 
parameters used for CoFe (soft layer) of the Pt/CoFe/MgO heterostructure is summarized in Table 1. CoFe 
has sufficient magnetostriction to produce a PMA gradient that can arrest the DW at specific positions in 
the model.  While Gilbert damping is ~0.01 to 0.03 in these materials, we used a higher value (0.1) so the 
DW exhibits more stable dynamics. In practice, defects and edge roughness are likely to impede the DW 
giving dynamics characteristic of the higher damping.

III.  Discussion of modeling results  

We discuss the modeling results for nanowires of length 1000 nm and width 100 nm patterned with 
five notches as shown in Fig 3. A gradient in PMA caused by the strain gradient drives the DW towards the 
lower PMA region in order to reduce the DW energy, i.e. motion is induced in the direction of the negative 
PMA gradient. We consider the case where the PMA gradient and STT from the charge current drive the 
DW in the same direction, and then we perform simulation in the presence of thermal noise to understand 
if these DWs can be arrested deterministically at room temperature at specific notches.  We subsequently 
perform another SOT-driven simulation in which the DW is arrested in regions of varying PMA produced 
by an alternative electrode design (Fig 4) and no notches are used.   

a. 

PMA gradient assists STT driven DW motion 

In  a  MTJ  racetrack  with  CoFe  soft  layer,  the  DW  motion  was  assumed  to  be  initiated  by  STT 
assisted by a PMA gradient (without including the effect of thermal noise). Given that the current pulse acts 
as the clocking signal, the ON time for current is fixed at 6 ns. This is considered the “write time” for

reprogramming the synaptic weight and, based on the analysis of the DW motion at different currents and 
PMA gradients, it is sufficient to translate the DW to any possible location within this STT clocked device.  

Table 2 shows the PMA gradients required to drive the DW from notch 1 to any of the other notches 
in Fig 3, if the current density of the clock is kept constant at	8.7	(cid:1876)	10(cid:2869)(cid:2870)	(cid:1827)	(cid:1865)(cid:2879)(cid:2870), which is just below the 
critical current needed to de-pin and initiate the DW motion. For a CoFe layer of 1 nm thickness and width 
100 nm this corresponds to a current of ~1 mA (we do not consider any current through the Pt layer and do 
not consider SOT for this case). We do not account for increase in current density at the notches in this 
simulation.  Furthermore,  from  the  point  of  view  of  programming  the  synapse,  the  voltage  required  to 
achieve a certain DW position need not be a linear function of position, as this is envisaged to be a pre-
calculated analog voltage that is output by the co-processor that implements the learning algorithm.

Table 2. PMA profile for achieving different positions of the DW. The DW starts at the 1st notch. The 
second column gives the change in PMA over the entire length of the device required to stop the DW at different 
notches. The third column shows the gradient in PMA for a 1 µm long device. 

These results show that at this current density, the current alone cannot drive the DW out of the 
first notch, but a combination of the current and PMA gradient can. The PMA gradient reduces the current 
density required to initiate and sustain the DW motion along the racetrack when compared to the case of 
current only. The DW motion is retarded as it moves into the region of lower PMA, helping to arrest the 
DW at the notches. The synergistic effects of PMA gradient and current lead to a lower energy operation. 
Finally, we confirm through simulation (Fig. 3) that each of the different positions of the DW is achievable 
deterministically, because at a certain PMA gradient the combined strength of the current and PMA gradient 
is sufficient to move the DW to the desired notch during the current ON period. Therefore, for different 
strengths of the PMA gradient, the DW travels different distances even though the application time of the 
current and PMA gradient is kept constant. 

Thermal noise effect at room temperature and scaling issues: The simulations were repeated in 
the presence of thermal noise at 300 K. With thermal noise, the minimum current required to initiate the 
motion of the DW has a lower value when compared to the zero thermal noise case. Moreover, there is a 
reduction in the effectiveness of the notch in arresting the motion of the DW in presence of thermal noise. 
Thus, a slight reduction of current is also required to regain the effectiveness of the notches while keeping 
it  high  enough  so  that  DW  motion  can  be  initiated.  This  determined  our  choice  of  a  current  density  of  
	8.4		10(cid:2869)(cid:2870)	(cid:1827)	(cid:1865)(cid:2879)(cid:2870) to explore the effect of thermal noise in arresting the DW motion at notch 3 with a PMA 
gradient of 10 Jm(cid:2879)(cid:2871)/(cid:1866)(cid:1865). This value of the PMA gradient is chosen between the PMA gradient required

for  arresting  the  DW  at  the  2nd  notch  (2	Jm(cid:2879)(cid:2871)/(cid:1866)(cid:1865))  and  the  3rd  notch  (16	Jm(cid:2879)(cid:2871)/(cid:1866)(cid:1865)).    The  probability 
distribution of the final position of the DW is shown in Fig. 3(b). The DW was most likely to be found in 
notches 3 or 4, but there was a significant probability of its being in notches 2 or 5.  

This  can  be  attributed  to  the  relatively  small  change  in  energy  due  to  PMA  modulation  through  strain 
compared to that of thermal energy (kbT= 4.14×10-21 J). To illustrate the energy scales, considering a 10 
Jm(cid:2879)(cid:2871)/(cid:1866)(cid:1865) PMA gradient (i.e. a total PMA modulation of 10 kJm-3 over the length of 1 µm nanowire), this 
energy change, ∆E= (∆PMA/L) × notch spacing × Volume = (10 Jm-3/nm) × 167 nm ×16700 nm3=26×10-
21 J≈ ~6.5 kbT. Here (∆PMA/L) is the PMA gradient (∆ PMA over 1 micron length), the volume corresponds 
to the volume of free layer between two notches, kb is the Boltzmann constant and T is room temperature 
in  Kelvin.  This  shows  that  the  change  in  PMA  is  modest  and  hence  the  PMA  gradient  does  not  have 
deterministic control in positioning the DW in the presence of thermal noise. To circumvent this issue, a 
higher  PMA  gradient  could  be  used,  though  this  would  require  a  greater  strain  gradient,  or  a  greater 
thickness free layer could be used with its PMA derived from bulk effects (e.g. magnetoelastic) instead of 
interfacial anisotropy.  This analysis has not considered edge roughness [42], which can provide additional 
pinning sites and even remove the need for lithographic patterning of notches.

SOT-driven DW motion with pinning of the DW achieved by spatial PMA modulation  
We also simulated DW motion clocked by SOT without including the effect of thermal noise in an MTJ 
racetrack with CoFe soft layer and no notches. Here we assume no current flows in the CoFe layer and 
hence  there  is  no  STT.  We  found  that  discrete  PMA  variation  as  shown  in  Fig.  4  was  more  suitable  to 
control DW in this case with SOT , instead of using notches and a uniform PMA gradient as in the previous 
case  with  STT.  The  electrode  arrangement  shown  in  Fig.  4  alters  the  PMA  at  specific  regions  of  the 
racetrack  between  the  electrodes  enabling  creation  of  regions  of  different  PMA.  Moreover,  due  to  the 
different spacing between the pairs of electrodes, the one with smaller gap will create a larger decrease in 
PMA due to higher stress. However, the PMA profiles in Fig. 4(b) are ideal representation of the actual 
PMA profile based on scaling arguments presented in section IV and prior work [31]. Determination of the 
real stress and PMA profile with detailed finite element analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. 

Fig. 4.  Schematic of the spintronic DW-synapse. (a) Top view showing a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) stack 
placed adjacent to the electrodes on a piezoelectric substrate for SOT driven DW with PMA modulation at 
regular intervals due to voltage applied to the piezoelectric locally by the electrodes. (b) Different position of the 
DWs achieved shown in the bottom figure by different PMA profiles created as shown in the upper panel. Initial 
position of the DW was 180 nm from left (not shown here). The strain profiles and PMA variations are 
assumptions that were estimated based on [31] and scaling arguments discussed in section IV. 

The SOT clock was simulated with a current density Jc ~ 0.7×1011 Am-2 through the Pt layer of 
length 1000 nm, width 100 nm and thickness 1 nm for a clocking period of 20 ns. For lower voltage applied 
to the strain electrode the PMA reduction is small at the left end. Therefore, the DW experiences smaller 
barriers and can be translated further to the right. With increasing voltage, barriers at the left increase, thus 
arresting the DW closer to the left end as shown in Fig 4 (b). The geometric arrangement of the electrodes 
will ensure that the PMA decrease due to adjacent electrodes varies in a linear fashion. In this case, the ratio 
between the maximum and minimum PMA change between right most and left most electrode position is 
kept at 3. This will ensure by only varying the voltage the DW can be arrested at all electrode location 
without requiring a very large stress to be applied to the piezoelectric. The maximum PMA change for each

case of the DW position is shown in Table 3.  The DW would eventually drift to the center of the racetrack 
to  minimize  magnetostatic  energy  once  the  applied  voltage  is  removed.  However,  with  realistic  edge 
roughness the DW is pinned [42] and hence implements a non-volatile synapse.

Energy Efficiency of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with Voltage Control of 
Domain Walls (VC-DW)  

While we have discussed the DW dynamics and operation of the non-volatile voltage programmed 
synapse in detail, Fig. 5 (a) shows the manner in which this device can be adapted to form a hybrid DW-
CMOS neuron. The CMOS buffer implements the threshold functionality of a neuron (Fig. 5 a) as well as 
the ability of the neuron output of one stage to drive inputs to various neurons of the next stage (high fan-
out  of  the  CMOS  stage)  via  synapses.  In  order  to  reset  the  neuron,  the  current/SOT  clock  is  used  with 
current flowing in the opposite direction. Thereafter, the clock is used to synchronize the information flow 
from one state of the DNN to the next. Fig. 5 describes the manner in which the outputs of one set of neurons 
can be multiplied by the synaptic weights and input to a neuron at the next stage.

Energy efficiency and area-density of the voltage control DW DNN implementation 

vs. other implementation schemes 

The energy dissipation in the device can be divided into two parts. One part consists of charging 
the piezoelectric layer for stress generation, which is essentially the energy lost in charging the capacitor 
(1/2)CV2, C = capacitance of the piezoelectric layer between the metal contacts, V= voltage applied).  The 
other part is the  (cid:1835)(cid:2870)(cid:1844) loss of the clocking current through the magnetic layer of the racetrack or current 
through the platinum layer.  

For  the  device  simulated  in  the  previous  sections,  the  maximum  ∆PMA  was	0.37 (cid:3400) 10(cid:2873)	(cid:1836)(cid:1865)(cid:2879)(cid:2871) 

across the length of the device. The stress required to obtain this may be estimated as σ =

∆(cid:3017)(cid:3014)(cid:3002)
(cid:2871)
(cid:2870)(cid:3415) (cid:3090)

 where λ is 

the magnetostriction. For CoFeB, with λ ~ 30 10-6, an unreasonably high stress of ~800 MPa would be 
required, but for CoFe with λ ~ 250 10-6 a stress of order ~100 MPa can produce the needed ∆PMA. From 
the Young’s modulus of CoFe of ~ 2.0 (cid:3400) 10(cid:2873) MPa, a strain of ~5 10-4 is required (or more specifically a 
strain gradient of 5 10-4 over 1 micron distance). Reference [31] shows that with a 500 µm thick lead 
zirconate titanate (PZT) substrate and electrodes of side 600 µm, a strain gradient of ~10-3 over a distance 
of 500 µm is feasible with application of 1.5 kV.  This suggests that a strain gradient of ~10-3 (~5×10-4 if a 
single electrode is considered) over 1000 nm distance is possible with application of 3 V. The effective 
capacitance, C= ~26 fF, assuming relative permittivity of 3000. Hence, the energy dissipated is (1/2)CV2 
~117 fJ for the electrical control of a scaled DW nanowire device with a footprint of 1000 nm × 100 nm 
and  electrode  of  footprint  1000  nm  ×  1000  nm.  In  the  SOT-clocked  case,  considering  70  nm  square 
electrodes  and  100  nm  thick  PZT,  the  total  capacitance  is  C  ~18  fF  while  voltage  needed  for  strain 
generation is 0.3 V following Ref [31]. This results in an energy dissipation of ~1 fJ. 

For the charge current through the CoFe layer with resistivity of 280 Ω.nm [43] and a current density 
of  Jc ~ 8.7×1012 Am-2 with a dimension of 1000 nm length, 100 nm width and 1 nm thickness for a clocking 
period  of  6  ns  the  energy  dissipated  due  to  I2R  loss  is  ~  15  pJ.  For  the  SOT  scheme,  considering  the 
resistivity of Pt to be 100 Ω.nm and charge current density J ~ 0.7×1011 Am-2 through the Pt layer of length 
1000 nm, width 100 nm and thickness 1 nm for a clocking period of 20 ns, the I2R loss is ~ 100 fJ. Therefore, 
energy consumption in the device is dominated by the current that produces the SOT. This can be further 
reduced if low damping materials such as iron garnets are used [44], which have the further advantage of 
avoiding  current  shunting  through  the  magnetic  layer.  The  difficulty  will  lie  in  optimizing  the  edge 
roughness and geometrical design of the racetrack to provide controllability at such low Gilbert damping. 
In summary, this clocked domain wall device concept provides a pathway to realize novel energy efficient 
DW  neuromorphic  devices  where  reprogramming  of  synaptic  weights  can  be  performed  at  ~100  fJ  per 
synapse  during the learning phase and similarly small ~100 fJ per neuron during the inference phase of the 
neural network. In fact, during the inference phase, a neuron implemented with only CMOS devices (not a 
hybrid  DW–CMOS  device)  would  only  need  ~  few  fJ  per  neuron  and  the  synapses  would  consume  no 
energy as they are non-volatile.  

It is interesting to compare these numbers with alternative implementations of artificial neurons 
and synapses. The most important benefit of our approach for artificial synapses is the large reduction in 

11 

 
  
energy consumption. The use of voltage control in conjunction with SOT drastically reduces the energy 
requirements versus purely spin torque domain wall-based devices [45]. Non-spintronic nanodevices can 
also provide multilevel synapses, such as oxide-based memristors [46] and phase change memories [29]. 
Programming such devices requires the physical motion of atoms in order to create or dissolve conductive 
filaments (oxide-based memristor) or to crystalize amorphous volumes of chalcogenide materials (phase 
change memory), which has an inherent energy cost, usually higher than picojoules even in highly scaled 
devices.  On  the  other  hand,  these  alternative  technologies  may  provide  more  compact  synapses  than 
spintronic  ones.    Our  solution  therefore  offers  an  extremely  energy  efficient  approach  to  potentially 
implement real time learning-capable systems.  

In contrast, the benefits of our approach for implementing artificial neurons is reduction in area 
(density). As neurons do not require non-volatility, CMOS-based solutions are typically used for neurons 
and have comparable energy consumption with ours. On the other hand, they typically require multiple 
transistors and several micrometre square of area [47]. 

V.  Conclusion 

The feasibility of an energy efficient voltage-controlled DW implementation of an artificial neuron 
and  synapse  was  demonstrated  using  micromagnetic  simulations.  In  this  approach,  modulation  of 
perpendicular anisotropy with stress in combination with SOT or STT is used to program different synaptic 
weights as well as to mimic a neuron. Scaling this device to smaller dimensions (for example, ~500 nm × 
50 nm  ×  1  nm)  could  result  in  much  lower  energy dissipation  as  well  as  high  densities  for  comparable 
energy dissipation (for implementing neurons) compared to competing approaches.  However, to avoid loss 
of  controllability  in  deterministic  positioning  of  the  DW  in  the  presence  of  thermal  noise,  careful 
optimization of material and device geometry are necessary. In summary, this work provides a pathway to 
the  realization  of  energy  efficient  voltage  controlled  artificial  neuron  networks  with  real  time  learning 
capability and could stimulate more experimental work in this direction.
