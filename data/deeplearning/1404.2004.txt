ABSTRACT
In recent years, wide-ﬁeld sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaging have presented a new path
for indirectly characterizing the progenitor populations of core-collapse supernovae (SN): systematic
light curve studies. We assemble a set of 76 grizy-band Type IIP SN light curves from Pan-STARRS1,
obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classiﬁed using both spectroscopy and machine
learning-based photometric techniques. We develop and apply a new Bayesian model for the full
multi-band evolution of each light curve in the sample. We ﬁnd no evidence of a sub-population
of fast-declining explosions (historically referred to as “Type IIL” SNe). However, we identify a
highly signiﬁcant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peak luminosity among our
SNe IIP. These results argue in favor of a single parameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass,
predominantly controlling the explosions of red supergiants. This relation could also be applied for
supernova cosmology, oﬀering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsic scatter of (cid:46) 0.2 mag. We
compare each light curve to physical models from hydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor
initial masses and other properties of the Pan-STARRS1 Type IIP SN sample. We show that correction
of systematic discrepancies between modeled and observed SN IIP light curve properties and an
expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enable robust progenitor inferences from multi-
band light curve samples of this kind. This work will serve as a pathﬁnder for photometric studies of
core-collapse SNe to be conducted through future wide ﬁeld transient searches.

INTRODUCTION
Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) mark the explosive
deaths of massive stars. Several independent lines of ev-
idence including explosion modeling (Nadyozhin 2003;
Maguire et al. 2012; Jerkstrand et al. 2013; Tak´ats et al.
2013), progenitor star photometry (Li et al. 2007; Smartt
et al. 2009; Walmswell & Eldridge 2012), rate statistics
(Smith et al. 2011), and theory (Heger et al. 2003; Ek-

str¨om et al. 2012) combine to suggest a lower main se-
quence initial mass (Min) limit for achieving core collapse
of Min (cid:38) 8 − 12 M(cid:12). Red supergiant progenitor stars in
this mass range are known to produce Type IIP (hydro-
gen rich) SN explosions, the most common form of core-
collapse SN. The upper mass limit for SNe IIP progeni-
tors is more uncertain, with stars of Min (cid:38) 16 − 30 M(cid:12)
realizing signiﬁcant mass loss depending on their mass,
metallicity, rotation rate, binarity, and other properties;
and even more massive stars ending their lives through
more exotic explosion mechanisms. These mass limits
for CC-SN progenitor stars have profound implications
throughout stellar and galactic astrophysics and cosmol-
ogy, including as an input to and constraint on models
of stellar evolution for massive stars (Groh et al. 2013a;
Meynet et al. 2013), chemical evolution (Timmes et al.
1995; Nomoto et al. 2006, 2013), supernova feedback in
the interstellar medium and galaxy formation (Leitherer
et al. 1992; Stilp et al. 2013), and astrobiological plan-
etary sterilization rates (Clark et al. 1977; Lineweaver
et al. 2004).

The electromagnetic signatures of these core-collapse
explosions are diverse, depending sensitively on the prop-
erties of both the core and the outer envelope of the pro-
genitor star at the time of explosion. Supernovae with
hydrogen features detected in their optical spectra are
referred to as Type II SNe, with a variety of subtypes
deﬁned by more speciﬁc spectroscopic and/or photomet-
ric criteria (see e.g. Filippenko 1997; Li et al. 2011). The

 
 
 
 
 
 
2

Sanders et al.

most common subclass, Type IIP, are typiﬁed by broad
(∼ 10, 000 km s−1) hydrogen Balmer P-Cygni spectro-
scopic features, fast rise times of a few days and opti-
cal light curves dominated by a long lived, ∼ 100 day
“plateau” phase of roughly constant luminosity. The
plateau phase is understood to arise from hydrogen re-
combination in the ejecta, with cooling temperature bal-
ancing the expansion of the blastwave to essentially equi-
librate the R-band luminosity (see e.g. Kasen & Woosley
2009). The Type IIL sub-class is historically designated
based on spectroscopic properties similar to SNe IIP,
but faster, “linearly” declining optical light curves rather
than a long lived plateau. Type IIb supernovae are clas-
siﬁed spectroscopically based on the disappearance of H
features and the prominence of He absorptions. Type IIb
light curves feature slow rise times and rapid decline rates
(in each case, a few weeks) typical of Type I (H deﬁcient)
SNe. The most extreme subclass, Type IIn, are identi-
ﬁed by intermediate width (∼ 103 km s−1) H emission
features reﬂecting interaction of supernova ejecta with
circumstellar material, and contributions from this in-
teraction can power these explosions to reach extreme
luminosities at peak.

The optical evolution of Type IIP SNe has been ex-
plored in light curve studies by a number of authors, in-
cluding Patat et al. (1994); Chieﬃ et al. (2003); Hamuy
(2003); Nadyozhin (2003); Bersten & Hamuy (2009); Li
et al. (2011); Arcavi et al. (2012); Anderson et al. (2014);
Faran et al. (2014). The relationship between these ob-
servables and the properties of SN progenitor stars has
been explored in theoretical parameter studies by Ar-
nett (1980); Litvinova & Nadezhin (1985); Young (2004);
Kasen & Woosley (2009); Dessart et al. (2013), and oth-
ers. Combining a uniform analysis of a statistical popu-
lation of Type IIP supernova light curves with consistent
physical models for inferring the properties of their stellar
progenitors represents a path forward for characterizing
the progenitor population.

Here we describe an analysis of a statistical sample
of SN IIP light curve properties, performed using obser-
vations from the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid
Response System 1 survey (Pan-STARRS1, abbreviated
PS1). This represents the ﬁrst such population analy-
sis of SN IIP light curves based on a homogeneously-
collected and multi-band photometric sample from a
wide ﬁeld optical survey.
In Section 2 we describe
the PS1 optical observations and follow-up optical spec-
troscopy program used to construct the light curve sam-
ple. We have developed a novel Bayesian methodol-
ogy for self-consistently modeling the full population of
light curves in the sample and obtaining robust mea-
surements of physically-meaningful light curve parame-
ters (Section 3). We discuss the population wide distri-
butions of these parameters and compare them to pre-
vious observational studies (Section 4). By comparison
to theoretical light curve models, we recover estimates
of the progenitor properties of the objects in our sam-
ple, and discuss the limitations of the available models
in Section 5. We summarize and conclude in Section 6.
In a companion paper, Sanders et al. (2014), we apply
the PS1 SN II data presented here as a test case for
a hierarchical Bayesian light curve ﬁtting methodology
which enables simultaneous modeling of full populations

of transient light curves.

2. OBSERVATIONS
2.1. Pan-STARRS1 imaging
We select a Type II SN light curve sample from the
transients discovered and monitored by PS1 since the ini-
tiation of the survey in 2010, consisting of 18,953 relevant
photometric data points, 5,096 of which are robust tran-
sient detections. PS1 is a high-etendue wide-ﬁeld imag-
ing system, designed for dedicated survey observations
and located on the peak of Haleakala on the island of
Maui in the Hawaiian island chain. Routine observations
are conducted remotely, from the University of Hawaii–
Institute for Astronomy Advanced Technology Research
Center (ATRC) in Pukalani. A summary of details of
PS1 operations relevant to SN studies is given in Rest
et al. (2013), and we discuss its key features here.

A complete description of the PS1 system, both hard-
ware and software, is provided by Kaiser et al. (2002).
The 1.8 m diameter primary mirror, 3.3◦ ﬁeld of view,
and other PS1 optical design elements are described in
Hodapp et al. (2004); the array of sixty 4800 × 4800,
0.258˝pixel detectors, and other attributes of the PS1
imager is described in Tonry & Onaka (2009); and the
survey design and execution strategy are described in
Chambers (in preparation). The PS1 Medium Deep Sur-
vey (MDS) consists of 10 pencil beam ﬁelds observed
with a typical cadence of 3 days in each ﬁlter, to a 5σ
depth of ∼ 23.3 mag in griz ﬁlters, and ∼ 21.7 mag in
the y-ﬁlter (with observations taken near full moon).

The PS1 observations are obtained through a set of
ﬁve broadband ﬁlters, which we refer to interchangeably
as as gP1, rP1, iP1, zP1, and yP1 or simply grizy (Stubbs
et al. 2010). Although the ﬁlter system for PS1 has much
in common with that used in previous surveys, such as
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS: York et al. 2000;
Aihara et al. 2011), there are important diﬀerences. The
gP1 ﬁlter extends 200 ˚A redward of gSDSS, and the zP1
ﬁlter is cut oﬀ at 9200 ˚A. SDSS has no corresponding
yP1 ﬁlter. Further information on the passband shapes
is described in Stubbs et al. (2010). Photometry is in
the “natural” PS1 system, m = 2.5 log(ﬂux) + m(cid:48), with
a single zero-point adjustment m(cid:48) made in each band to
conform to the AB magnitude scale (Tonry et al. 2012).13
We assume a systematic uncertainty of 1% for our PS1
observations due to the asymmetric PS1 point spread
function and uncertainty in the photometric zero-point
calibration (Tonry et al. 2012). See Figure 1 for an illus-
tration of the PS1 photometric sampling and the range
in data quality.

The standard reduction, astrometric solution, and
stacking of the nightly images is done by the Pan-
STARRS1 IPP system (Magnier 2006; Magnier et al.
2008). The nightly MDS stacks are transferred to the
Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences “Odyssey” Re-
search Computing cluster, where they are processed
through a frame subtraction analysis using the photpipe
image diﬀerencing pipeline developed for the SuperMA-
CHO and ESSENCE surveys (Rest et al. 2005; Miknaitis
et al. 2007; Rest et al. 2013).

system, except where explicitly noted.

sub-sample classiﬁed as SNe IIP (see Section 3.4) are shown with
the thick line.

2.2. Optical spectroscopy
We begin with a selection of PS1-discovered SNe which
were classiﬁed as Type II through our spectroscopic
follow-up campaign: 112 objects in total. One object in
our sample, PS1-10ae (SN 2010aq), has previously been
reported on in Gezari et al. (2010). We note that the PS1
spectroscopic follow-up is not complete; brighter objects,
those with longer plateau durations, and those with the
highest ratio of SN to underlying galaxy light are most
likely to be over-represented in our sample, due to their
availability for spectroscopy.

Spectra were obtained using the Blue Channel and
Hectospec spectrographs of the 6.5 m MMT telescope
(Schmidt et al. 1989; Fabricant et al. 2005), the Low
Dispersion Survey Spectrograph (LDSS3) and Inamori-
Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph (IMACS;
Dressler et al. 2006) of the 6.5 m Magellan telescopes,
the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph of the 8 m Gem-
ini telescopes (GMOS; Hook et al. 2004), and the and
the Andalucia Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera
(ALFOSC) at the 2.6 m Nordic Optical Telescope. Ob-
jects were classiﬁed as Type II by identiﬁcation of Hα
emission not associated with the host galaxy. This selec-
tion could possibly include the Type IIP, IIL, IIb, and
Type IIn subclasses of the SNe II; we will discuss sub-
classiﬁcation in Section 3.4.

Additionally, we obtain host galaxy redshift measure-
ments for each object from these spectra, which we use
for K-correction (see Section 2.3) and to estimate dis-
tance.14 Figure 2 shows the host galaxy redshift distribu-
tion of the PS1 SN II sample, which has [16,50,84]th per-
centile values of [0.07, 0.11, 0.21]. The sub-sample classi-
ﬁed as SNe IIP (see Section 3.4) have distribution per-
centile values of [0.07,0.10,0.16]. This diﬀerence reﬂects
a population of luminous, distant SNe IIn excluded from
the sub-sample.

2.3. K-corrections
We use K-corrections to account for the diﬀerence be-
tween the observed and rest frame wavelengths of the
light collected through the PS1 ﬁlters, as a function of
the redshift of each object in our sample. We deﬁne
this correction, K = mR − MQ − DM , where mR is
the observed-frame magnitude, MQ is the emitted-frame
absolute magnitude, and DM is the distance modulus
(Hogg et al. 2002). We estimate K-corrections using the
SN IIP spectral templates provided by P. Nugent (based
on observations of SN 1999em; Gilliland et al. 1999;
Baron et al. 2004)15. We interpolate linearly between
the spectral templates to obtain K-corrections for arbi-
trary epochs. We note that we do not warp the spectral
templates to match the observed color of the SN, due to
the computational cost involved in doing so dynamically
within our probabilistic light curve ﬁtting methodology
(see Appendix A). By testing the eﬀects of warping the
spectral templates on the K-correction calculation, we
estimate that neglecting this eﬀect will introduce an un-
certainty of ∼ 0.02 mag in the K-correction per 0.1 mag
of (V −I) color oﬀset, which is much smaller than typical
uncertainties in our color estimates.

Figure 3 illustrates the resulting K-corrections for an
illustrative set of epochs. The t = 0 K-correction is
linear with z because the post-shock breakout cooling
phase spectral model is a blackbody; thereafter the K-
correction evolution becomes more complex, with spec-
tral features evolving and shifting between bandpasses.
The bluer bands have K-corrections more highly depen-
dent on time, as the onset of line blanketing in the spec-
tral model depresses the ﬂux blueward of ∼ 5000 ˚A.

Deviation of the supernova spectral energy distribu-
tion from the template spectra will introduce error into
our derived K-correction. In particular, we consider here
the eﬀect of diﬀerences in the SN IIP continuum shape
and line-of-sight extinction, and estimate the magnitude
of these eﬀects by simulation on the template spectra.
First, we consider the eﬀect of variation in continuum
shape, to ﬁrst order. We vary the intrinsic (V − I) color
of the supernova spectrum by ±0.5 mag from the stock
template, at ﬁxed redshift (z = 0.1), epoch (t = 50 days),
and with no extinction. The eﬀect of this variance in
spectral shape on the K-correction over the full 1 mag
color range induces a variation in the K-correction rang-
ing from 0.1 mag in g-band to 0.3 mag in y-band. Second,
we consider the eﬀect of variation in extinction. We vary
the extinction from AV = 0 to 2 mag, at ﬁxed redshift
(z = 0.1), epoch (t = 50 days), and with the color of the
stock template. The eﬀect of this variance in spectral
shape on the K-correction over the full 2 mag extinction
range induces a variation in the K-correction ranging
from 0.1 mag in y-band to 0.2 mag in i-band. These ef-
fects are therefore modest and similar in size, depending
on the exact parameters of the photometric observation.
We estimate the typical eﬀect of the joint variation
in both continuum shape and extinction by means of
Monte Carlo simulation. We generate 10, 000 random
supernova observations with the following conditionally

independent distributions of properties meant to ap-
proximately mimic the PS1 dataset:
redshift drawn
from z ∼ logN(−2, 0.4), color deviation drawn from
∆(V − I) ∼ N(0, 0.5) mag16, extinction drawn from
AV ∼ logN(0, 1) mag, and epoch drawn from t ∼
logN(4, 0.8) days, where N is the normal and logN
is the lognormal distribution. We then consider the
distribution of residuals of the derived K-corrections
from the K-correction expected for a zero-extinction
and template-standard color object.
In the r-band,
this distribution has [5, 16, 50, 84, 95] percentile values of
[−0.10, −0.01, 0.13, 0.40, 0.75] mag. The distribution is
similar in other ﬁlters. This suggests that these eﬀects
exert a small (∼ 0.1 mag) typical bias and introduces a
modest additional uncertainty (∼ 0.2 mag) in the mea-
sured supernova photometry. We therefore neglect these
eﬀects in the following work, but note their importance

16 Our simulated (V − I) color distribution is meant to provide
a conservative accounting of intrinsic spectral deviance between
SNe IIP. For comparison, Olivares (2008) identify an intrinsic (V −
I) color dispersion of < 0.1 mag.

for studies requiring precision photometry. In the most
extreme cases, particularly for the most highly reddened
supernovae, the simulations suggest that these eﬀects will
cause the brightness to be signiﬁcantly under-estimated
(by (cid:38) 0.7 mag). Moreover, the simulated K-correction
residuals seem to have little correlation between ﬁlters,
suggesting that the eﬀects do not signiﬁcantly bias color
inference.

These parameters have the following deﬁnitions and
interpretations. The time parameters are deﬁned where
t is the Modiﬁed Julian Date (MJD) epoch of an obser-
vation, t0 is the epoch of explosion, t1 is the rest frame
duration of the power law rise phase, tp is the duration
of the exponential rise phase (ending at peak ﬂux), t2
is the duration of the falling component of the plateau
phase, and td is the duration of the transitional phase.
The ﬂux parameters are deﬁned such that M1 is the ﬂux
at the transition from the power law to the exponential
rise phases, Mp is the peak ﬂux, M2 is the ﬂux at the end
of the plateau phase, and Md is the ﬂux at the transition
to the Co decay-dominated phase. The rate parameters
are deﬁned such that α is the power law rise slope, β1
is the exponential rate constant during the rising phase
of the plateau, β2 is the rate constant during the declin-
ing phase of the plateau, βdN is the exponential decline
rate of the transition phase following the plateau, and
βdC is the exponential decay constant corresponding to
56Co to 56Fe decay. Each parameter is deﬁned indepen-
dently for each photometric ﬁlter, with the exception of
t0. For numerical convenience, we deﬁne l in arbitrary
scaled units relative to the absolute magnitude M , such
that M = −2.5 log10(107 × l).

Note that, in order for the light curve model to be con-
tinuous, not all of the parameters may be independent.
In particular, for each ﬁlter,

M1 = Mp/ exp(β1tp)
M2 = Mp/ exp(−β2t2)
Md = M2/ exp(−βdN td)

Furthermore, we note that the post-peak decay rate β2
is directly related to the quantity ∆m15, the decline in
magnitudes of the light curve in the 15 days following
peak:

Our model is similar to the linear segmented light
curve ﬁtting approach of e.g. Patat et al. (1993), but

3. LIGHT CURVE MODELING
In order to consistently compare the photometric prop-
erties of the SN IIPs in our sample, we have produced
models of the full, multi-band light curve evolution of
each SN using a Bayesian methodology. We apply weakly
informative priors to regularize the shape of the light
curve ﬁts to conform to SN IIP phenomenology. The
product of the modeling is a posterior predictive prob-
ability distribution for the luminosity of the SN at ev-
ery phase, and joint posterior probability distributions
for associated light curve parameters. This methodol-
ogy enables us to model the full pseudo-bolometric light
curve evolution of all objects in our sample from explo-
sion through the radioactive decay phase, regardless of
variation in photometric coverage and data quality, while
fully accounting for statistical uncertainty. Throughout,
we interpret these marginal parameter probability dis-
tributions in the context of the inﬂuence of the weakly
informative priors to avoid introducing bias on our infer-
ence.

3.1. Parameterized light curve model
To model the light curve, we use a simple, physically-
motivated parameterization that captures the essential
components of the rise, plateau, and decline phases of the
Type IIP light curve. Our model is constructed so that
the most salient features of the SN IIP light curve (the
plateau duration, peak magnitude, and the luminosity
evolution of the radioactive decay phase) are represented
by directly interpretable parameters.

The light curve model for the luminosity measured
from our PS1 forced photometry, l, in a given optical ﬁl-
ter, F , consists of 5 piecewise components (see Figure 4):
a power law fast rise phase, a plateau phase divided into
exponential rising and declining components, a transi-
tional phase representing the end of the plateau, and a
post-plateau exponential decay phase:

the MCMC chain.

We employ weakly informative priors (see e.g. Gel-
man et al. 2008) to regularize the ﬁtted models to the
characteristic SN IIP light curve shape. These prior
distributions are constructed to more than encompass
the observed variance in parameter values from well-
identiﬁed light curves in the dataset. The Stan model
in Appendix A fully deﬁnes the ﬁxed prior distributions
we employ, and we discuss their most salient properties
here. Figure 5 illustrates the procedure for constructing
the prior distributions which we have deﬁned individually
per ﬁlter in the model. For t2, we apply a (lognormal)
log N(log(100), 0.3) day prior. Together with our prior
on tp (Figure 5), this eﬀectively provides a prior on the
plateau duration which has [5, 50, 95]th percentile val-
ues of [70, 110, 180] days in i-band (and similar in other
bands). This prior is constructed to be weakly informa-
tive, having signiﬁcantly more variance than previously
reported SN IIP plateau duration distributions (Arcavi
et al. 2012) and covering a range of values similar to that
predicted from theoretical modeling (Kasen & Woosley
2009). Perhaps the most informative prior we apply is
that on the peak-magnitude distribution, which is ob-
servationally motivated. A strong prior is desirable for
this parameter because it has the eﬀect of regularizing
the light curve shape in cases where photometric obser-
vations before peak are not available. We set this prior
to N (−17.5 mag, 0.8 mag) to approximately match the
Type II SN luminosity function predicted for an R-band
magnitude-limited survey by Li et al. (2011) based on ob-
servations from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search
(LOSS; Figure 6).18

In total, including the independent parameters for each
light curve segment and ﬁlter, the ﬁtted model for each
SN has 61 independent parameters (12 per ﬁlter and t0).
We reproduce the ﬁtted light curve parameters for each
object in our sample in Table 3.

3.3. Fitting validation
Following execution of Stan and posterior sampling, we
reconstruct a posterior predictive distribution for each
light curve from the model parameter samples (Gelman
et al. 2013). This distribution represents the probability
for the physical supernova light curve to have the lumi-
nosity lm on a grid of times tm.

Figure 7 illustrates a posterior predictive check for the
model ﬁt to the object PS1-11apd, whose well-sampled
observations illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses
of the 5-component model. The rising phase in each
band is well-constrained by the tightest pre-explosion
limit, in the y-band. The two-component (rising then
falling) plateau phase provides an accurate description
of the data in the i-band, but not in the g-band, where
the evolution of iron line blanketing (see e.g. Kasen &
Woosley 2009) causes a behavior not captured by the
model (falling then rising/plateauing). As is characteris-

18 Note that Li et al. (2011) treat the SN II population as a
mixture of relatively low luminosity and relatively luminous SNe
(referred to as Type IIP and IIL, respectively), leading to a bi-
modal luminosity function as in Figure 6. Here we assume a uni-
modal Gaussian prior wide enough to encompass both modes of
the Li et al. (2011) luminosity function, and investigate the possi-
bility of multi-modality in the observed properties of the SNe II in
Section 4.2.

curve model deﬁned in Equation 1. The gray vertical lines denote
the duration (tx) between epochs of transition between the piece-
wise components of the model. The background level (Yb) and
turnover ﬂuxes (Mx) are marked and labeled (red points). The
power law (α) and exponential (βx) rate constant for each phase
are labeled adjacent to each light curve segment.
(as we will discuss in Section 3.2) our ﬁtting methodol-
ogy for the knot properties is fully probabilistic rather
than manual. We prefer this piecewise analytic formu-
lation to the additive components model used by e.g.
Olivares (2008). The piecewise parameters will in princi-
pal have weaker covariance, therefore reducing the pos-
terior curvature and increasing the eﬃciency of Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from
the posterior. While this parameterization is designed to
capture the phenomenology of Type IIP SNe, it is in
practice quite ﬂexible, as we obtain reasonably descrip-
tive ﬁts to the light curves of other Type II SNe (e.g.
SNe IIn and IIb).

3.2. Fitting methodology
We estimate the posterior distributions of these model
parameters using a MCMC method. We employ the
C++ library Stan (Stan Development Team 2014a),
which implements the adaptive Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) No-U-Turn Sampler of Hoﬀman & Gel-
man (2014). For each multi-band SN light curve, we use
Stan to return 1000 samples (250 samples each from 4
independent MCMC chains) from the posterior distribu-
tion of the model.17

In addition to the light curve parameterization outlined
in Section 3, our Stan model includes certain features
representing the data acquisition process. To account
for uncertainty in the PS1 background template subtrac-
tions, we ﬁt for the background level in each ﬁlter using
an independent set of luminosity parameters, Yb[F ], and
an intrinsic model variance, V [F ]. We pre-compute K-
correction curves for the redshift of each object in our
sample (see Section 2.3), and apply them to the model
during the likelihood calculation using the phases corre-
sponding to the sampled explosion date at each step in

tic of the PS1 data, the y-band light curve is more poorly
sampled and higher in variance than the other bands.
In general, the model parameter inferences are therefore
more reliable and directly interpretable in the r, i, and
z bands.

Figure 8 illustrates ﬁtting behavior for a well-sampled
and a poorly-sampled PS1 light curve. The top panel
shows PS1-12bku, a SN with observations from the rise
phase through the end of the plateau. Note that the
nonlinear behavior of the light curve during the rise, due
to shock breakout and post-shock breakout cooling en-
velope eﬀects (see e.g. Nakar & Sari 2010; Rabinak &
Waxman 2011) are not captured by the power law rise
model, but the explosion epoch itself is ﬁt accurately in
the ﬁtted model. PS1-10zu is shown in the bottom panel,
an object which apparently exploded during the gap be-
tween observing seasons. With observations only avail-
able starting a few weeks before the end of the plateau
phase, and no direct constraints on the explosion epoch,
the model ﬁt includes a range of possible explosion dates
reﬂecting the prior distributions for the plateau duration
and peak magnitude.

We apply a supervised machine learning methodology
(see e.g. Faraway et al. 2014) to classify the Type II SNe
in this sample into their appropriate subclasses and, in
particular, to identify SNe IIP for further analysis. Our
approach is to ﬁrst apply “expert knowledge” to manu-
ally label a subset of clearly-classiﬁable objects from our
sample of 112 SNe II, then we uniformly measure light
curve features using the methodology described in Sec-
tion 3.1, then train a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classiﬁer to a deliberately-selected subset of these fea-
tures, and ﬁnally apply that classiﬁer to assign labels to
the remaining objects in the sample. In general, spectral
classiﬁcation of distant (z (cid:38) 0.1) transients is compli-
cated by spectral evolution (see e.g. Milisavljevic et al.
2013 for a discussion of SNe IIb), exacerbated by the
observational cost of obtaining a well sampled spectral
series, and the diﬃculty in robustly identifying spectral
features, exacerbated by the low signal-to-noise of the

spectroscopy relative to nearby objects. The methodol-
ogy discussed below is intended to capitalize on photo-
metric information to help overcome these limitations.

Our procedure is as follows. We begin by manually as-
signing SN IIP, IIb, IIn, and “II?” (undetermined) clas-
siﬁcations to each object in the sample by inspection of
their light curves and optical spectra. See e.g. Li et al.
(2011) for a discussion of the photometric and spectro-
scopic properties of SN II sub-classes. We do not es-
tablish a label for SNe IIL separate from SNe IIP, but
discuss that sub-class later in Section 4.2. We assign
SN IIn classiﬁcations to 23 objects based on the detec-
tion of intermediate-width H emission features and/or
exceptional luminosity ((cid:46) −20 mag); SN IIb classiﬁca-
tions to 5 objects based on the detection of He features
(in addition to broad H features) in the optical spectrum
and/or a SN I-like light curve, with slow rise and fast de-
cline rate; and SN IIP to 67 objects based on the presence
of a broad Hα spectral feature and/or a clearly-exhibited
plateau-like light curve. Finally, we liberally apply the
SN II? classiﬁcation to 17 objects for which we do not
have suﬃcient data to assign a classiﬁcation and/or do
not neatly ﬁt the preceding criteria.

We apply our Bayesian light curve model (Section 3.1)
to uniformly measure features of the light curves of every
SN II in our PS1 sample. To mirror our expert knowl-
edge, we focus on the peak absolute magnitude (M ), the
rise time to peak magnitude (tp), and the post-peak de-
cay rate (β2) as features capable of distinguishing ob-
jects in these subclasses. We identify the i band as the
ﬁlter in which these features are most discriminating.
For self-consistency, we apply the SN IIP theoretical K-
corrections (Section 2.3) to every object in the sample.

We then ﬁt a linear SVM classiﬁer (Pedregosa et al.
2011) to the features of the training set. The SVM con-
sists of a series of hyperplanes that optimally divide the
feature space to discriminate the training set based on
their class labels. The results of this ﬁt are displayed in
Figure 9. In summary, the classiﬁer identiﬁes SNe IIn as
luminous (primarily Mi < −18 mag) and slowly-evolving
(log β2 (cid:46) −3), SNe IIb as intermediate-luminosity and
quickly evolving, and SNe IIP as slowly-evolving and
spanning a range from sub-luminous (Mi > −17 mag)
to luminous (Mi ∼ −20 mag), accurately reﬂecting our
expert knowledge applied in construction of the training
set. Disagreement between object location and shaded
labeling in Figure 9 is partially due to variance in the ob-
servational data, which limits the eﬃciency of the classi-
ﬁer, and partially due to the coarse binning of the display
slices. We have conﬁgured the classiﬁer with the penalty
parameter C = 1 and class weights calculated from their
representation in the training set.

Finally, we apply the classiﬁer to the unclassiﬁed
(SNII?) objects to infer their subclasses. While “SN IIb”
and “IIn” classiﬁcations can only be assigned by spec-
troscopy, by deﬁnition, here we are using photometric
information to supplement available spectroscopy for the
purpose of predicting the most likely spectroscopic sub-
classiﬁcation. The classiﬁer identiﬁes 9 of these objects
as SNe IIP, which we hereafter incorporate in our SN IIP
sample; 6 as SNe IIb; and 3 as SNe IIn.

When applied to the training set, the classiﬁer achieves
83% accuracy across all sub-types, and 89% accuracy
for SNe IIP. It mistakenly classiﬁes SNe IIb and IIn as

sub-classes. The colored points represent the training set, and the

tion for each object, with larger points indicating smaller uncer-
tainty.

SNe IIP only 22% of the time (the false identiﬁcation
rate), and mistakenly classiﬁes SNe IIP as other classes
only 11% of the time (the false negative rate). These
statistics imply that, of our sample of 17 SNe II?, ∼ 3
may be incorrectly classiﬁed as SNe IIP and ∼ 3 legiti-
mate SNe IIP may be inadvertently excluded. In combi-
nation with our sample of 67 securely-identiﬁed SNe IIP,
this level of false identiﬁcation would imply a ∼ 4% con-
tamination rate within the sample. Given the relatively
low S/N of the SN II? objects, the classiﬁer may per-
form more poorly than on the training dataset; but for
the same reason, the inﬂuence of these objects on our
light curve parameter inferences will be correspondingly
suppressed.

4. RESULTS
In this section, we present the results of our analysis
of the observational properties of the PS1 SN IIP light
curves. The parameters calculated for individual objects
are summarized in Table 5.

4.1. SN IIP Light Curve Template
We construct grizy SN IIP template light curves based
on scaled stacks of our PS1 photometric sample. Fig-
ure 10 (left) shows these stacked SN light curves.
In
each band, we only include objects with a 1σ uncer-
tainty in the peak magnitude of < 0.5 mag and with
an uncertainty in the plateau epoch of < 10 days, as es-
timated from the marginal posterior of the ﬁtted light
curve model. In total, we include [63, 66, 64, 63, 32] ob-
jects in the [g, r, i, z, y]-band templates.

Figure 10 (right) shows the template light curves con-
structed from these data. The template magnitudes are
calculated based on the range of observed photometry
within a moving window of 6 rest frame days in width,
between ∼ −10–110 days from peak magnitude. Tem-
plate values are only reported if at least 4 photometric
observations fall in the window.
In total, we include
[434, 586, 760, 757, 267] observations in constructing the
[g, r, i, z, y]-band templates. The templates are repro-
duced in Table 4.

4.2. Search for an SN IIL sub-population
Past studies have varied widely in their interpretation
of a putative, fast-declining sub-class of SNe II com-
monly labeled “SNe IIL.” The SN IIL classiﬁcation was
coined by Barbon et al. (1979), in recognition of a set
of 6 Type II SNe with an unusually fast decline rate of
∼ 0.05 mag day−1 in the B-band, constituting ∼ 26%
of their SN II sample. From a theoretical perspective, a
fast declining SN II suggests a less massive H envelope
and consequently less sustained power contribution from
H recombination. Likely explanations for diversity in H
envelope mass among SN II progenitors include varia-
tion in progenitor initial mass, with SNe IIL likely to
arise from either progenitors with intrinsically less mas-
sive envelopes (e.g. initial masses of ∼ 7−10 M(cid:12); Swartz
et al. 1991) or from more massive stars which have been
stripped by strong radiation driven winds ((cid:38) 18 M(cid:12);
Smith et al. 2011), and/or stars which have been partially
stripped by interaction with binary companions (Nomoto
et al. 1995).

Observationally, no widely adopted criteria for SN IIL
classiﬁcation have emerged. Patat et al. (1994) divided

their SN II light curve set into “linear” and “plateau”
classes based on the Barbon et al. (1979) criterion, but
they describe the decline rate distribution of these ob-
jects as continuous and ﬁnd no statistical evidence for
two modes in the distribution. In their population study
of the LOSS SNe, Li et al. (2011) deﬁne SN IIL as hav-
ing SN IIP-like spectroscopic features, but exhibiting an
R-band decline of > 0.5 mag after explosion. By their
selected criterion, they identify 7 unambiguous SNe IIL
among 81 SNe II, and they determine SNe IIL to repre-
sent 10% of the volume-limited SN II population. They
ﬁnd that the SNe IIL are on average over-luminous com-
pared to SNe IIP, and therefore would represent ∼ 25%
of a magnitude-limited SN II survey sample. By inspec-
tion of a set of 22 SN II light curves from the CCCP
and the literature, Arcavi et al. (2012) identify a set of
5 objects which they describe as SNe IIL. Their selec-
tion corresponds to a decline rate criteria of (cid:38) 0.3 mag
within 50 days of explosion. They suggest that these ob-
jects form a class “distinct” from SNe IIP, and that the
two classes together do not form a continuum of decline
rates. Most recently, Anderson et al. (2014) have char-
acterized the decline rate distribution of hydrogen-rich
SNe as continuous.

We take an empirical approach to searching for evi-
dence of a fast-declining mode in the sample of PS1 ob-
jects classiﬁed nominally as SNe IIP (see Section 3.4).
Figure 11 shows the distribution of mean posterior val-
ues for the β2 plateau decline rate parameter in our ﬁtted
light curve models, among objects with signiﬁcant con-
straints on the plateau phase decay behavior. We employ
Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE) to estimate
the underlying form of the decline rate distribution from
the observed data. We select a KDE bandwidth factor
of 0.43 in r-band (and similar in other bands) based on
the number of objects in the well constrained sample,
following Scott (1992).
Inspection of the KDE models
in Figure 11 does not indicate the presence of any fast-
declining modes, e.g. within the shaded regions corre-
sponding to the Barbon et al. (1979) and Li et al. (2011)
criteria. Given the limited sample size, this test would
not be sensitive to the existence of a small SN IIL sub-
population if they are subsumed within the fast-declining
tail of a more numerous SN IIP population. However, a
signiﬁcant sub-population (∼ 20%) as proposed by pre-
vious authors should emerge if present.

We therefore conclude that empirical evidence for a
distinct SN IIL sub-population is not present within the
PS1 SN II dataset, and hereafter we do not distinguish
between SNe IIL and IIP. Discounting the existence of
an SN IIL subclass diﬀers from the interpretation ap-
plied in many past studies, but does not disagree quan-
titatively with past results. Li et al. (2011) adopted an
SN IIL classiﬁcation scheme deﬁned arbitrarily by previ-
ous authors (Barbon et al. 1979) for the purpose of es-
timating volumetric rates. Patat et al. (1994) applied a
similar criterion, then tested for a discontinuity between
the properties of this sub-population and the “normal”
SN IIP population. They reported a negative result. Ar-
cavi et al. (2012) identiﬁed a slow declining subset of
objects in their sample, but did not quantitatively test
for a discontinuity. Moreover, we note that our sample,
consisting of 112 SNe II in total, is ∼ 40% larger than the
Li et al. (2011) SN II sample and ∼ 5 times larger than

that their response function includes redder wavelengths
than our r-band photometry. This may partially explain
the slower decline rates in their sample, as redder ﬁlters
(e.g.
izy-bands) exhibit more gradual SN IIP decline
rates in the plateau phase. Regardless, this comparison
illustrates that the long-recognized range of decline rates
among SNe with broad Hα features falls within the ob-
served, continuous range of decline behavior exhibited
by objects classiﬁed as SNe IIP in our sample, with no
evidence for a second, fast-declining mode in the popu-
lation.

4.3. Plateau duration distribution
Recent observational studies have suggested that the
plateau durations of SNe IIP are tightly distributed
around ∼ 100 days (Poznanski et al. 2009; Arcavi et al.
2012), in stark contrast to theoretical predictions that
they should vary from ∼ 80−200 days given the expected
range of progenitor properties including mass, energy,
and radius (see e.g. Kasen & Woosley 2009). Poznan-
ski (2013) has interpreted this as evidence that the joint
parameter space of progenitor properties must be tightly
constrained, with the explosion energy scaling precisely
with the cube of the mass to produce a roughly constant
plateau duration.

We quantitatively assess the plateau duration distri-
bution of our SNe IIP sample.
In agreement with Ar-
cavi et al. (2012), Poznanski (2013), and Faran et al.
(2014), the r-band plateau duration distribution of our
sample (Figure 12) is peaked around ∼ 90 − 100 days,
with median value of 92 days and 1σ variation of 14 days.
However, the full observed range of plateau durations
is signiﬁcantly larger, 42 − 126 days. Note that we do
not include in this distribution poorly-constrained light
curves, where the marginalized posterior uncertainty is
> 80% of the prior variance (24 days at 1σ). For those
poorly constrained objects, as Figure 12 illustrates, the
posterior is typically peaked around the mean of the prior
distribution.

Our PS1 sample therefore suggests that the observed
variation in SN IIP plateau durations is not as highly
constrained as suggested by Poznanski et al. (2009) and
Arcavi et al. (2012). However, we do not detect objects
with plateaus as long lived as the least energetic objects
produced in the model grid of Kasen & Woosley (2009)
(e.g. ∼ 200 days for kinetic explosion energy of 0.3 B
at inﬁnity). However, all wide ﬁeld surveys will be in-
sensitive to identifying the longest duration objects for
two primary reasons. First, such low energy explosions
will have correspondingly low luminosities (L50 ∼ 41.8,
similar to the least luminous objects in our sample; see
Table 5) and therefore be subject to Malmquist bias.
Second, because the length of the observing seasons of
each PS1 MD ﬁeld (typically (cid:46) 160 days) are similar to
the SN IIP plateau duration, there will be an observa-
tional bias towards measuring well-constrained plateau
durations only for short-duration objects. We therefore
interpret the results presented here as a lower limit on
the true variation in the SN IIP plateau duration distri-
bution. In a companion paper, Sanders et al. (2014), we
use a hierarchical Bayesian light curve ﬁtting methodol-
ogy to assess the inﬂuence of these biases on our inferred
plateau duration distribution, and to estimate the un-

Investigation of a potential SN IIL sub-population.
The histograms display the distribution of mean posterior values
for the β2 plateau decline rate parameter in our ﬁtted light curve
models in each photometric band. Only objects classiﬁed nominally
as SNe IIP (i.e. not classiﬁed as SNe IIn or IIb, see Section 3.4), and
only objects with well constrained β2 posteriors (with variance ≤
80% of the prior variance), are included. The dashed lines display
the Gaussian kernel density estimate models for the distributions.
The g-band shaded region shows the approximate range for objects
that would be classiﬁed as SNe IIL under the Barbon et al. (1979)
B-band criterion (with more positive β2 values reﬂecting faster
decline rates), and the r-band shaded region shows the Li et al.

the Arcavi et al. (2012) sample. Using a similarly sized
sample, Anderson et al. (2014) have reported indepen-
dent results in agreement with the continuum of decline
rates we report here.

Figure 10 further illustrates this result, showing our
SN IIP r-band photometry in comparison to the aver-
aged unﬁltered SN IIP and SN IIL light curves of Li
et al. (2011). Both their templates fall within the photo-
metric range of our observed sample, with their SN IIP
template falling near the +1σ range of our light curves
and their SN IIL template falling near the median of
our light curves. Note that their photometry was col-
lected with an unﬁltered photometric system, which Li
et al. (2011) compare to R band. This would suggest

4.4. Line of sight extinction
We correct for total extinction (Galactic and host envi-
ronment) using the (V −I) color excess method of Nugent
et al. (2006) as revised by Kasen & Woosley (2009)—
see Figure 13. We calculate E(V − I) by comparing to
the theoretical baseline (V − I) color19 for the given V -
band luminosity (Equation 15 of Kasen & Woosley 2009),
and convert to extinction in each griz band using the
extinction curve of Cardelli et al. (1989) and assuming
RV = 3.1. We apply a physically-motivated uniform
prior enforcing E(V − I) ≥ 0 mag. The median uncer-
tainty for the extinction estimate of an individual SN is
0.4 mag.

We ﬁnd extinctions varying from 0.0 − 4.8 mag, with
median value of (cid:104)AV (cid:105) = 1.3 mag.
In this distribution
we have excluded objects with extinction uncertainties
≥ 2 mag, aﬀecting 8 objects. This median is somewhat
higher than the mean extinction reported by Smartt et al.
(2009) for their sample of SNe IIP with progenitor imag-
ing, (cid:104)AV (cid:105) = 0.7 ± 1.1 mag. The discrepancy may result
from a combination of diﬀerences in methodology (the
estimates from Smartt et al. 2009 are derived from a
heterogeneous set of sources and techniques) and sam-
ple selection (given that our PS1 transient search oper-
ates in red bands, particularly i and z, it may be rela-
tively insensitive to selection against high extinction ob-

19 We convert our griz photometry to the Landolt and Vega sys-
tems using a color-based S correction obtained by integrating over
the temporally nearest available UVOIR spectrum of SN 1999em,
the ∼ +37 day spectrum from Leonard et al. (2002). We ﬁnd that
s-corrections based on the spectrophotometric templates applied in
Section 2.3 would introduce a systematic discrepancy in the (I − i)
color relative to SN IIP corrections in past works (e.g. D’Andrea
et al. 2010) of ∼ 0.4 mag, due to diﬀerences in the equivalent
width of the NIR Ca II emission feature. We estimate a ∼ 0.1 mag
systematic uncertainty may remain in our I-band magnitude esti-
mates due to variation in this feature. We apply the AB oﬀset of
Blanton & Roweis (2007).

tion estimation. The points show the V magnitude and (V − I)

jects). Both observations and theory show that there
is signiﬁcant scatter around the ﬁducial (V − I) color,
indicating intrinsic color variation not accounted for in
our color excess-based extinction estimate. Moreover,
the color excess method may be particularly vulnerable
to under estimates for low-metallicity progenitors where
decreased iron line blanketing would reduce suppression
of blue ﬂux. We note that Faran et al. (2014) have re-
cently shown that both photometric and spectroscopic
SN IIP extinction correction prescriptions have limited
eﬀectiveness (as measured by their ability to reduce the
scatter in observed colors), and exhibit systematic oﬀsets
relative to each other.

4.5. Peak magnitude distribution
We show the peak absolute magnitude distribution for
our PS1 SN IIP sample in each photometric ﬁlter in Fig-
ure 14. We correct for extinction using the (V − I) color
excess method, as described in Section 4.4. Statistics of
these distributions are given in Table 1. In this table and
hereafter, we include only objects with well constrained
posterior distributions: δMpeak < 0.1 mag at 1σ without
extinction correction, and δMpeak < 0.2 mag with correc-
tion. The median uncertainty for the absolute magnitude
measurement (1σ posterior width) is δMpeak of 0.07 mag
in r band without extinction correction, and 0.35 mag
after correction.

The observed peak magnitude distribution agrees well
with the R band luminosity function of Li et al. (2011),
reﬂected in the prior distribution shown in Figure 14 (see
also Section 3.2 and Figure 6). The comparison is some-
what limited, as Li et al. (2011) examined a diﬀerent ﬁlter
(R) and did not correct for extinction (although the ob-
jects in their sample should have low extinction). Note
that this similarity suggests agreement of the observed
distribution of peak magnitudes between our surveys. If

ues within the SN IIP absolute, K-corrected peak magnitude distribu-
tion, without (“observed”) and with extinction correction (Section 4.4).
Only PS1 SNe IIP with low posterior uncertainty in their peak magni-
tudes are included (δM < 0.1 mag at 1σ without extinction correction,
δM < 0.2 mag with); the total number of objects in each distribution
(N) is given. Each row corresponds to a PS1 photometric ﬁlter (F).

the prior were simply dominating our inferred peak mag-
nitudes, the posterior medians would all be centered at
the prior mean (Mpeak = −17.5). This eﬀect can be seen
in the y-band peak magnitude distribution shown in Fig-
ure 14, where prior information does dominate for a sub-
stantial fraction of objects. Extinction correction shifts
the median of the distribution by ∼ 0.6 mag in g-band,
and only ∼ 0.1 mag in z-band. We regard the y-band
distribution as least reliable due to the small number of
objects (N = 15) that pass our posterior width cut, and
therefore do not include them in Table 1.

The extinction corrected peak magnitude distribution
spans a 1σ range of −17.47 to −19.28 mag in r-band,
indicating a factor of ∼ 3 spread in the luminosity dis-
tribution of these SNe. This wide range in SN properties
has important implications for the mass distribution of
their progenitor stars, which we will model and discuss in
Section 5.4. Richardson et al. (2014) found a B-band vol-
ume limited peak magnitude distribution with mean and
standard deviation of MB ∼ −17 ± 1 among 74 SNe IIP
from the literature, ∼ 1.5 mag dimmer than the g-band
mean peak magnitude we report. The discrepancy in
the mean of the absolute magnitude distributions be-
tween our study and theirs is likely due to a combina-
tion of sample selection eﬀects and extinction correction
methodology. Richardson et al. (2014) have considered
SNe IIL separately from SNe IIP, which systematically
lowers their SN IIP peak magnitude distribution rela-
tive to ours (see Section 4.2). Morever, Richardson et al.
(2014) have applied a statistical correction for extinc-
tion, assuming a mean value of AB ∼ 0.3 mag for each
core-collapse SN, which is typically ∼ 1 mag lower than
the extinction correction we measure among our SNe IIP
with the (V − I) color excess method (Section 4.4).

4.6. Decline rate–peak magnitude relation
Upon investigation of the joint posterior parameter dis-
tributions among our ﬁtted SN IIP light curves, we iden-
tiﬁed a highly signiﬁcant relation between the plateau
phase decline rate (β2) and the extinction corrected peak
magnitude (Mpeak) of the SNe. Figure 15 illustrates
that these parameters are highly correlated in r-band,
with Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of −0.50 (p-value of
5 × 10−06). We have evaluated the strength of the cor-
relation between these parameters in all combinations of
photometric ﬁlters available from the PS1 dataset (Fig-
ure 16) and identiﬁed this relation to be signiﬁcant in
every band (except y, where the PS1 photometry is lim-

ited), though it is strongest in the r and i-bands.

In the r-band, the relation between these parameters

is best ﬁt with the relation:

log β2[r] = (−13.1 ± 1.2) + Mpeak[r] (−0.47 ± 0.07)

(6)

This linear ﬁt was obtained using a Bayesian methodol-
ogy accounting for the two dimensional covariance of the
Mpeak and β2 posterior distributions for each SN, and
modeling the relationship between these values with an
intrinsic scatter V orthogonal to the axis of the ﬁt line
(Hogg et al. 2010).

The [16, 50, 84]th percentile values of the intrinsic scat-
ter parameter, projected to the peak magnitude axis,
are [0.14, 0.16, 0.19] mag. No samples among the 20, 000
returned from our MCMC ﬁt of this model have posi-
tive slopes for the linear ﬁt, supporting the low p-value
reported from the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient test
above. When we perform the same analysis on the ob-
served absolute peak magnitudes, not corrected for ex-
tinction, we ﬁnd a similar trend, but with somewhat de-
creased signiﬁcance (p-value of 1 × 10−05 and projected
intrinsic scatter median V = 0.26 mag). This result sug-
gests that application of the color-excess based extinc-
tion estimates provides measurable success in recovering
the intrinsic distribution of light curve properties, despite
the shortcomings described in Section 4.4. Considering
the V -band data of Anderson et al. (2014)20 and apply-
ing the same Bayesian linear ﬁtting methodology yields
a median intrinsic scatter of V = 0.3 mag. The larger
intrinsic scatter indicated by the Anderson et al. (2014)
data results in part from the much smaller uncertainties
in the light curve parameters of the nearby SNe they
study. This discrepancy may imply that the uncertain-
ties in our light curve parameters are somewhat overes-
timated, or that theirs are somewhat underestimated.

In past studies, divisions of SN IIP samples into “nor-
mal” SN IIP and SN IIL (see Section 4.2) sub-classes
may have obscured this relation by reducing the dynamic
range available for correlations against the decline rate.
Anderson et al. (2014) have recently reported an inde-
pendent discovery of this relation using a similarly-sized
sample of V -band light curves from a variety of past
SN searches. This independent discovery, and the multi-
band manifestation of the relation that we explore here,
underscores its physical signiﬁcance. This result echoes
past conclusions that “SNe IIL” are on average more lu-
minous than more slowly declining SNe IIP (e.g. Patat
et al. 1994; Li et al. 2011).

The existence of a decline rate–peak magnitude rela-
tion for SNe IIP is reminiscent of the well known width–
luminosity relation for SNe Ia (e.g. Phillips et al. 1999).
However, while brighter SNe Ia have more slowly de-
clining light curves, brighter SNe IIP instead have faster
declining light curves (Figure 15). Moreover, the SN IIP
relation has signiﬁcant intrinsic scatter: V ∼ 0.2 mag.
That the SN IIP decline rate–peak magnitude relation is
recoverable at all is testament to the wide range of vari-
ation in their plateau phase decline rates, which ranges

20 Here we exclude SN 2008bp, which Anderson et al. (2014)
identify as an outlier and special case, and we transform their s2
parameters to our β2 given that log β2 = log(s2/108.6).

5. PROGENITOR MODELING
We compare the light curve models for each SN IIP in
our sample to relevant theoretical models to estimate the
physical properties of their progenitor stars.

5.1. Bolometric luminosity
For the purpose of comparing to the full-wavelength
spectrophotometric models of Kasen & Woosley (2009),
we estimate the pseudo-bolometric (OIR) luminosity of
each SN by integrating over the multi-band (grizy) light
curve model described in Section 3.2. We apply a cor-
rection to the pseudo-bolometric light curves to, primar-
ily, account for unobserved IR ﬂux and some UV emis-
sion. We calculate this correction (pBC) by integrat-
ing a SN IIP spectral template from a similar epoch
(t = +61 days; Gilliland et al. 1999; Baron et al. 2004)
over the (cid:48)griz(cid:48) bands, obtaining pBC = 0.38 mag. By
using a ﬁxed spectral template, we neglect any intrinsic
variation in the SN IIP spectral properties. The model-
ing in Kasen & Woosley (2009) suggests that any intrinsic
color variation among SNe IIP is small, with the bolo-
metric correction estimated to vary by ∼ 0.1 mag based
on diﬀerences in progenitor metallicity and initial mass
(their Figure 14).

5.2. Ejected Ni mass
We estimate the ejected mass of radioactive 56Ni (MNi)
by comparison to the late-time light curve of SN 1987A
(see Figure 17), following the method of Pastorello et al.
(2004). We compare our pseudo-bolometric light curves
(Section 5.1) to the SN 1987A light curve using the late-
time (> 125 days) rest frame epoch where the model is
most tightly constrained and assuming complete gamma-
ray trapping, as in Pastorello et al. (2004); but see also
the discussion of gamma-ray trapping in Anderson et al.
(2014).

The distribution of MNi among our PS1 SNe IIP has
[16, 50, 84]th percentile values of [0.04, 0.12, 0.20] M(cid:12) (see
Figure 18). We include in this distribution only objects
with photometry to directly constrain their light curve
evolution in the radioactive decay dominated phase. We
identify such objects by looking at the posterior variance
in the βdN parameter, which is δβdN = 1 dex at 1σ in
cases where the prior alone sets the parameter value. We
therefore adopt a cut at δβdN < 0.9 dex to exclude poorly
constrained Ni masses. We note that, among the entire
sample, the typical uncertainty in MNi is fairly large (me-
dian of 0.4 dex) due to the relatively poor photometric
coverage of the late phases of SNe in the sample. Among
the excluded objects, some have unphysically large me-
dian estimates for the ejected 56Ni mass (MNi > 1 M(cid:12));
the high uncertainty in these estimates is appropriately
reﬂected in the conﬁdence intervals quoted in Table 5.

Our results suggest a factor of ∼ 2 smaller MNi for
most SNe IIP in comparison to typical SNe Ib and Ic,
which have (cid:104)MNi(cid:105) ≈ 0.20 ± 0.16 M(cid:12) (Drout et al. 2011).
This is consistent with the expectation that SNe Ib and
Ic are produced by more massive stellar progenitors than
SNe IIP. Our measured MNi distribution is similar to that
reported by Nadyozhin (2003), who derive MNi ranging
from 0.03 − 0.4 M(cid:12) for a set of 11 SNe IIP from the
literature, with a mean value of 0.10 M(cid:12).

lation for diﬀerent photometric ﬁlter sets. The shading represents

a factor of ∼ 20.

The SN Ia decline rate–peak magnitude relation is in-
terpreted as evidence for a fundamental plane or single-
parameter family among SNe Ia light curves, and a simi-
larly sparse dimensionality may apply to SNe IIP. Several
authors have argued for a single parameter source of vari-
ation among SNe IIP light curves (Hamuy 2003; Poznan-
ski 2013), particularly with respect to the luminosity–
velocity relation applied in the standardizable candle
method (Hamuy & Pinto 2002; Olivares 2008; D’Andrea
et al. 2010). Interpreted together with the results of Sec-
tion 4.2, this would seem to point to the explosion energy,
likely determined by the progenitor initial mass through
its inﬂuence on the mass of the hydrogen envelope at
the time of explosion, as the predominant single param-
eter continuously determining the fundamental observa-
tional properties of the explosions of hydrogen-rich red
supergiants, as Anderson et al. (2014) also concluded.
However, the presence of signiﬁcant scatter around the
SN IIP decline rate–peak magnitude relation presented
here suggests additional correlations with secondary fac-
tors, as have emerged among SNe Ia (Wang et al. 2009;
Foley et al. 2011). Relevant secondary characteristics of
the progenitor stars are likely to include metallicity and
rotation velocity.

In general, more massive H-rich envelopes should have
longer radiative diﬀusion times (tdiﬀ ∝ M/R), suggest-
ing slower light curve evolution and lower peak magni-
tudes. However, Poznanski (2013) have found an empir-
ical linear relation between the progenitor initial mass
of SNe IIP and their expansion velocities in the plateau
phase. With these two factors in opposition, this would
suggest that the diﬀusion time, and perhaps the β2 pa-
rameter, should be nearly constant among SNe IIP. This
discrepancy could result from nonlinearity in the rela-
tionship between progenitor initial mass and the mass of
the hydrogen envelope at the time of explosion or vari-
ation in the velocity evolution between SNe IIP. Alter-
natively, it may challenge the robustness of the linear

vide scaling relations for the observable parameters L50
(bolometric luminosity at 50 days after explosion) and
tp,0 (plateau phase duration, corrected for extension by
ejected 56Ni) as a function of E51 (total explosion energy
in units of 1051 ergs) and Min (initial mass of progenitor
star). We note that there is a well known discrepancy
between masses derived from hydrodynamic light curve
modeling and direct progenitor searches, with progeni-
tor searches yielding lower mass estimates (Utrobin &
Chugai 2008; Maguire et al. 2010).

We derive tp,0 using their Equation 13, which requires
an estimate for MNi (see Section 5.2), R0 (the progeni-
tor radius at the time of explosion) and Mej (the total
ejected mass). Following the recommendations of Kasen
& Woosley (2009), we calculate values for R0 and Mej
strictly as a function of Min by interpolating over the
progenitor star model grid used in their study. Solving
this system of equations for every sample in the posterior
distribution of the light curve model, we obtain estimates
for Min, Mej, and E51 for each SN IIP in our sample.

5.4. Progenitor initial mass inference
In Figure 19, we compare the observed plateau dura-
tion and L50 to model curves from Kasen & Woosley
(2009). This comparison illustrates that the observed
variation in SN IIP light curve phenomenology is signif-
icantly larger than the range explored by the Kasen &
Woosley (2009) model grid, preventing us from perform-
ing progenitor parameter estimation for a substantial
number of the objects in our sample. Given the observed
MNi values measured for each individual light curve, 67
of our SNe IIP have light curve properties outside the
region covered by the Kasen & Woosley (2009) models,
and we can produce mathematically valid comparisons
to model light curves from the Kasen & Woosley (2009)
grid for only 8 SNe IIP (see Table 5). Even these com-
parisons typically yield explosion energies at or above the
most energetic models in their grid (E51 > 5). A large
number of objects in our sample have luminosities lower
than the range of theoretical values for a given plateau
duration (falling in the blue shaded region of Figure 19);
accounting for 61 of the 67 objects for which we do not
report progenitor inferences.

We therefore advocate for further theoretical explo-
ration of the SN IIP light curve parameter phase space
through additional hydrodynamic modeling, in order to
provide more robust model grids and scaling relations
for comparison to observational surveys. In particular,
certain modeling systematics should be addressed to en-
able inference on objects occupying the low-luminosity
and short plateau duration parameter space. Dessart
& Hillier (2011) have previously recognized a systematic
discrepancy between SN IIP model and observed light
curves, and identiﬁed over-sized radii in model progenitor
stars as the likely cause. Hydrodynamic explosion simu-
lations based on more advanced progenitor star models,
taking into account important eﬀects such as rotation on
the stellar radius (e.g. Georgy et al. 2013), are needed
to overcome this bias. Moreover, synthetic light curves
for SNe with progenitor initial masses < 12 M(cid:12), down to
the limit for core-collapse (e.g. 8 M(cid:12), see Smartt et al.
2009 and references therein), and higher explosion en-
ergies should be produced. Such low mass progenitors

time bolometric light curve of SN 1987A (red dashed line; from

in the bolometric luminosity as derived from the multi-band light
curve model is illustrated with the shaded region, including the
uncertainty in the explosion epoch.

among all objects in our sample, and the black shaded region shows
only objects with photometry constraining the light curve evolution
in the radioactive decay phase (based on the variance in the βdC
posterior; see text).

5.3. Comparison to hydrodynamic models
We derive physical parameters (including progenitor
initial mass, radius, and explosion energy) for the pro-
genitor stars of our SN IIP sample by comparison to
the modeling of Kasen & Woosley (2009).
In general,
more massive progenitor stars produce plateaus that are
brighter and of longer duration. There is a secondary
contribution from MNi which has the eﬀect of increas-
ing the plateau duration. Kasen & Woosley (2009) pro-

have already been explored in the context of extremely
low luminosity SN IIP like SN 1997D (Chugai & Utrobin
2000), and model light curves of this kind calculated with
full self-consistency across the mass and energy spectrum
are needed.

Additionally, other progenitor physical parameters will
play important secondary roles in determining SN light
curve properties and should be included in future sim-
ulations.
In particular, lower metallicity can serve to
lower the plateau luminosity by decreasing the opacity
of the H envelope, therefore lowering plateau luminosi-
ties, and by decreasing mass loss, causing longer lived H
recombination and plateau durations (Kasen & Woosley
2009; Dessart et al. 2013). Dessart et al. (2013) have
recently performed a theoretical survey of SN IIP radia-
tive properties using a grid of synthetic progenitor stars
expanded in parameter scope with respect to the grid of
Kasen & Woosley (2009), including core overshoot, ro-
tation, mixing, and metallicity. However, the Dessart
et al. (2013) grid was limited to a single initial progen-
itor mass of 15 M(cid:12). An expanded survey of the kind
performed by Dessart et al. (2013), to provide updated
observationally-applicable scaling relations of the kind
provided by Kasen & Woosley (2009), would be an in-
valuable tool for inference on the progenitor population
of massive star explosions in the nascent untargeted sur-
vey era. Photometric galaxy metallicity diagnostics like
that presented in Sanders et al. (2013) can be used to
observationally estimate metallicities for the progenitor
stars of observed SNe to facilitate model comparison.

5.5. Implications for the Red Supergiant Problem
While theoretical stellar evolution modeling has histor-
ically predicted that stars undergoing core-collapse up to
∼ 25 M(cid:12) should produce Type IIP SNe (see e.g. Eldridge
2008; Smartt 2009 and references therein), a variety of
observational techniques have failed to identify SN IIP
progenitors with masses greater than ∼ 16 M(cid:12). The
shape of the stellar initial mass function can at least help
to explain this absence, with ∼ 8 M(cid:12) progenitors being
a factor of 10 − 15 times more common than ∼ 25 M(cid:12)
progenitors. However, even accounting for IMF prescrip-
tions of varying steepness, Smartt (2009) reported an
upper limit for the SN IIP progenitor mass of 16.5 M(cid:12)
based on their direct progenitor detection search. Simi-
larly, in an X-ray analysis of SN IIP progenitor mass loss
rates, Dwarkadas (2014) estimated a maximum mass loss
rate of ∼ 19 M(cid:12). Black hole fallback formation (Fryer
1999; Heger et al. 2003) and / or progenitor rotation
(Georgy et al. 2013; Groh et al. 2013b) may provide a
theoretical solution to this “Red Supergiant Problem.”

Our results have only indirect implications for the Red
Supergiant Problem. While our progenitor mass esti-
mates (e.g. Figure 19) show no evidence for an absence
of SN IIP progenitor stars at the high mass end of the
Kasen & Woosley (2009) progenitor grid, our mass esti-
mates are only as reliable as the calibration of the hydro-
dynamic modeling underpinning them. As we have dis-
cussed, there are known systematic oﬀsets between the
masses inferred from hydrodynamic modeling and pro-
genitor star photometry, and additional theoretical in-
vestigation of this discrepancy is needed to conclusively
resolve the Red Supergiant Problem.

However, our observations and modeling suggest that

there is no discontinuous distinction between Type IIP
and IIL SNe (Section 4.2). Given the correlation between
plateau phase decline rate and luminosity (Section 4.6),
and the theoretical connection between luminosity and
progenitor mass, the exclusion of luminous “SNe IIL”
could obscure the high-mass end of the SNe IIP progen-
itor population. Emphasizing the role of small number
statistics in this regime, we note that Smartt (2009) re-
port a progenitor mass upper limit that is already con-
sistent with 20 M(cid:12) at 2σ, and consistent with > 25 M(cid:12)
at 2σ if only events with robust progenitor detections are
included in the analysis. Walmswell & Eldridge (2012)
have recently considered the extinction due to the dust
produced by red supergiant winds and revised the SN IIP
upper mass limit to 20+6
−3 M(cid:12) (with 2σ uncertainty). As
the direct progenitor search technique has so far only
been applied to a handful of objects, we look to future
detections of the progenitors of luminous SNe IIP to ad-
dress the Red Supergiant Problem (see e.g. Fraser et al.
2010; Elias-Rosa et al. 2011).

6. CONCLUSIONS
We have assembled and studied the full sample of
Type IIP SN light curves from the Pan-STARRS1
Medium Deep Survey, totaling 18,953 photometric data
points (5,096 robust transient detections) in grizy ﬁlters
for 112 individual SNe (76 SNe IIP). We have developed
a Bayesian light curve ﬁtting methodology for SNe II
based on a physically-motivated 5-component segmenta-
tion of the SN IIP light curve (Section 3.1). We present
an implementation of our SN IIP model for use with the
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo library Stan in Appendix A.
We have interpreted our light curve modeling in terms of
the hydrodynamic Type IIP SN progenitor model grid of
Kasen & Woosley (2009).

The primary conclusions of this work are as follows:

• We present photometric K-corrections and SN IIP
light curve templates in the grizy bands (Sec-
tions 2.3 and 4.1). Our templates are based on
2,804 individual photometric detections for 66 in-
dividual SNe IIP from −15 to +114 days from peak
magnitude.

• Consistent with theoretical

expectations,

our
SN IIP sample spans a diverse range of light curve
parameters: a factor of ∼ 20 in plateau phase decay
rate (Figure 11), ∼ 2 orders of magnitude in ejected
56Ni (Figure 18), a factor of ∼ 2 in plateau dura-
tion (Figure 12), and (cid:38) 4 mag in absolute magni-
tude (Figure 14). This evidence stands in contrast
to recent suggestions by Arcavi et al. (2012) and
Poznanski (2013) that the SN IIP plateau dura-
tion distribution, a critical observational parameter
tied to progenitor initial mass, is tightly distributed
(Section 4.3).

• Addressing a longstanding debate in the literature,
we have searched for the existence of a fast declin-
ing “SN IIL” sub-population in the decline rate dis-
tribution of our SN IIP sample (Section 4.2). We
ﬁnd no evidence for a discontinuity in this distri-
bution for any photometric band, questioning the
existence of a discrete SN IIL sub-population.

Figure 19. Comparison of observed SNe IIP light curve properties to hydrodynamic light curve models. The points show the plateau
duration (tp+t2, rest frame; not corrected for MNi) of SNe IIP from the PS1 sample versus their bolometric luminosity at 50 days after
explosion (L50). Red points have well-constrained values for the plateau duration (δtp < 20%), while gray points have poorer constraints.
The solid lines show interpolated values for progenitors of diﬀerent initial masses (Min; key at right) from the model grid of Kasen & Woosley
(2009). Diﬀerent curves are plotted to illustrate the range of variation with the mass of ejected radioactive nickel (MNi = [0, 0.50] M(cid:12)
for [solid, dashed] line styles, respectively). The shaded curves illustrate physical parameter space not explored by the Kasen & Woosley
(2009) model grid, ostensibly corresponding to masses < 12 or > 25 M(cid:12).

• We identify a highly signiﬁcant statistical corre-
lation between the peak magnitude and plateau
phase decline rate of SNe IIP (Section 4.6). To-
gether with the previous results, this supports the
interpretation of core-collapse among hydrogen-
rich red supergiants as a predominantly single pa-
rameter family of explosions, whose observational
behavior is determined primarily by the explosion
energy and likely set by the initial mass of the
progenitor star. This represents an independent
discovery and conﬁrmation of results recently re-
ported in Anderson et al. (2014).

• Through the largest systematic comparison to date
of SN IIP lightcurves to hydrodynamic progenitor
models, we have derived mass, radius, and explo-

sion energy estimates for the objects in our sam-
ple (Section 5.4). However, we ﬁnd that the avail-
able theoretical model grids are insuﬃcient to cover
the full range of observed variation in SN IIP light
curve properties. We point to the need for addi-
tional hydrodynamic modeling to produce updated
and expanded self-consistent model grids, particu-
larly in the low luminosity regime.

• Though our progenitor inferences are based on hy-
drodynamic light curve models, which are known
to produce systematically higher masses than di-
rect progenitor detection searches, we do not ﬁnd
evidence for an absence of high-mass SN IIP pro-
genitors (Section 5.5). We point to future direct
progenitor detections of luminous SNe IIP as hav-

ing the potential to ease the discrepancy between
the maximum SN IIP progenitor mass identiﬁed
by various theoretical and observational methods,
known as the Red Supergiant Problem.

In a companion paper, Sanders et al. (2014), we dis-
cuss and demonstrate a hierarchical expansion of the
model presented here to provide a general framework
for the analysis of supernova light curve populations in
the coming era of next generation wide ﬁeld transient
searches. We advocate continued investment in statis-
tical and computational tools in the future as a means
to compensate for the relative decline anticipated in the
availability of detailed spectroscopic and other follow-up
information on individual transients.

ful conversations; D. Kasen for his thoughtful comments

APPENDIX A: INDIVIDUAL LIGHT CURVE STAN MODEL

APPENDIX

Below we reproduce the full Bayesian model for our 5-component segmented SN II light curve model described in
Section 3.2, in the Stan modeling language. The Stan model speciﬁcation format is documented in the Stan Modeling
Language Users Guide and Reference Manual (Stan Development Team 2014b).

The model takes the following data as input: N obs, the total number of photometric data points; N filt, the
number of photometric ﬁlters; t, a vector of MJD dates of the photometric observations; fL, a vector of luminosities
corresponding to the photometric observations (with units as described in Section 3.1); dfL a corresponding vector
of luminosity uncertainties; z the redshift; t0 mean an initial estimate of the explosion date (for initialization and
for centering the explosion date prior distribution); J a vector of integers specifying the ﬁlter ID of each photometric
observation; Kcor N, a matrix of pre-computed K-corrections for each ﬁlter, in magnitudes with spacing of 1 day;
fluxscale the zero-point of the luminosity unit system (fluxscale = 107 in the system we have employed); and
duringseason, a boolean value specifying whether the object exploded within or between observing seasons, for selec-
tion of the explosion date prior distribution parameters. The calculation of the model light curve ﬂux and application
of the K-correction values is performed in the transformed parameters section, and the prior and likelihood calcu-
lations are performed in the model section. Certain vector-valued prior distribution parameters are speciﬁed in the
transformed data section for convenience.

The Stan model is then compiled and run (Stan Development Team 2014b) to yield MCMC samples from the

posterior distribution of light curve parameters. We have used PyStan version 2.2.021.

We conﬁgured the No-U-Turn Sampler to use ﬁxed 0 initialization of the parameter values, an adaptation phase of
250 steps, a maximum treedepth of 22, and otherwise employed the default sampler parameters. Using this conﬁgura-
tion, we achieve a Gelman-Rubin between-to-within chain variance ratio of ˆR < 1.02 for 95% of parameters, indicating
excellent convergence. The typical run time is 1 minute per chain.

APPENDIX B: LINEAR RELATION WITH INTRINSIC SCATTER STAN MODEL

Below we reproduce the full probabilistic model describing a linear relation between bivariate data with intrinsic
scatter, which we apply to the SN IIP Decline rate–peak magnitude in Section 4.6, speciﬁed in the Stan modeling
language and following (Hogg et al. 2010).

The model takes the following data as input: N, the number of bivariate observations; x and y, the mean observed
values of the ﬁrst and second covariates; dx and dy, the uncertainty (standard deviation) of each observation projected
along the axis of each covariate; and dxy the covariance of each observation. In the transformed parameters section,
the sampled angle of the linear relation from the x-axis (theta) and its perpendicular distance (b perp) from the origin
are used to calculate the perpendicular distance of each observation from the ridgeline of the sampled relation and
its projected variance. The prior and likelihood calculations are performed in the model section, accounting for both
the projected observational variance and the intrinsic variance (V). The b perp and theta parameters are transformed
into traditional linear slope and oﬀset parameters (m,b) in the generated quantities section for convenience.

The Stan model is then compiled and run as described in Appendix A.

Note. — This table includes only SNe classiﬁed as SNe IIP by the criteria of Section 3.4. PS1 SN is the PS1 designation of the transient; ﬁeld
is the PS1 Medium Deep Field where the transient was discovered, RA and DEC are in J2000 coordinates, Disc. MJD is the date of discovery, z
is the redshift obtained from our follow-up spectroscopy (Section 2.2), and Nx is the number of detections of the object included in our dataset
in each PS1 ﬁlter (additional photometric non-detections are also used to constrain the explosion date and decay behavior).

Note. — The r-band peak magnitude (Mp,r) is derived directly from the model ﬁts (Section 3.2), including K-corrections, but not corrected for
extinction. The r-band plateau duration (tplateau,r) is in rest frame days, not corrected for contamination by 56Ni. The pseudo-bolometric (OIR)
luminosity at 50 days (L50) is measured from the ﬁts to the PS1 photometry; the value quoted does not include the bolometric correction described
in Section 3.2. The decline rate in r-band (∆m15,r; rest frame days) is measured from the same model ﬁts. The ejected nickel mass is estimated
from comparison of the late-time bolometric light curve to that of SN 1987A (but see Section 5.2 for a discussion of reliability). The progenitor
initial mass (Min), radius (R0), and explosion energy (E51) estimates come from the comparisons (see Section 5.3) to the models of Kasen &
Woosley (2009); but see Section 5.4 for a discussion of reliability. These theoretical estimates are reported only if the central mass estimate falls
within the model grid (12 − 25 M(cid:12)); but the full posterior distribution for the reported values includes extrapolations to values beyond the model
grid, as reﬂected in the reported uncertainties. All reported values represent [16,50,84]th percentiles of the posterior distribution.
