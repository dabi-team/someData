ABSTRACT
Recently, pre-trained programming language models such as Code-
BERT have demonstrated substantial gains in code search. Despite
showing great performance, they rely on the availability of large
amounts of parallel data to fine-tune the semantic mappings be-
tween queries and code. This restricts their practicality in domain-
specific languages that have relatively scarce and expensive data. In
this paper, we propose CDCS, a novel approach for domain-specific
code search. CDCS employs a transfer learning framework where an
initial program representation model is pre-trained on a large cor-
pus of common programming languages (such as Java and Python),
and is further adapted to domain-specific languages such as Solidity
and SQL. Unlike cross-language CodeBERT, which is directly fine-
tuned in the target language, CDCS adapts a few-shot meta-learning
algorithm called MAML to learn the good initialization of model
parameters, which can be best reused in a domain-specific lan-
guage. We evaluate the proposed approach on two domain-specific
languages, namely Solidity and SQL, with model transferred from
two widely used languages (Python and Java). Experimental re-
sults show that CDCS significantly outperforms conventional pre-
trained code models that are directly fine-tuned in domain-specific
languages, and it is particularly effective for scarce data.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely utilized for
code search [4, 10, 14, 15, 27? ]. Unlike traditional keyword matching
methods [2, 7, 9, 17, 18, 21], deep code search models employ deep
neural networks to learn the representations of both queries and
code, and measure their similarities through vector distances. The
application of DNNs significantly improves the understanding of
code semantics, thereby achieving superb performance in code
search tasks [10, 14, 37? ].

A major challenge for deep code search is the adaptation of deep
learning models to domain-specific languages. State-of-the-art code
search methods are mainly designed for common languages such
as Java and Python. They rely heavily on the availability of large
parallel data to learn the semantic mappings between code and
natural language [12]. On the other hand, there is an emerging
trend of domain-specific languages such as Solidity for smart con-
tracts [35, 36, 41] where code search is also needed. There is often
insufficient training data in specific domains, causing poor fit of
deep learning models. Furthermore, for each specific domain, the
costs of data collection, cleaning, and model training for construct-
ing an accurate model are all non-neglectable.

One potential route towards addressing this issue is the pre-
trained code models, which pre-train a common representation
model on a large, multilingual code corpus, and then fine-tune the
model on task-specific data [28]. This enables code search models
to transfer prior knowledge from the data-rich languages to the
low-resource language. For example, CodeBERT [10], the state-of-
the-art code representation model, can be pre-trained on multiple
common languages and then fine-tuned in the code search task for a
target language [28]. However, it is challenging to reuse knowledge
from a mix of source languages for code search in the target lan-
guage. Different languages have their unique characteristics, and
correspond to different representations. Parameters learnt from
each language can distract each other, resulting in a conflict in
the shared representations. This is even more challenging in the
domain-specific code search, where the target language usually has
scarce training samples.

In this paper, we present CDCS (Cross-Domain Deep Code Search),
a cross-domain code search technique based on few-shot meta
learning. CDCS extends the “pretraining-finetuning” paradigm of
CodeBERT with a meta learning phase that explicitly adapts the
model parameters learnt from multiple source languages to the
target language. CDCS begins by pre-training CodeBERT on a large
corpus of multiple common languages such as Java and Python.
Then, a meta learning algorithm named MAML (Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning) is employed in order to prevent the model param-
eters from falling into the local optimization of source languages.

The goal of this algorithm is to find the initialization of model pa-
rameters that enables fast adaptation to a new task with a small
amount of training examples.

To evaluate the effectiveness of CDCS, we pre-train CDCS on
a large corpus of common languages such as Python and Java.
Then, we perform code search on two domain-specific datasets
written in Solidity and SQL. We compare our approach with three
baseline models, namely, a neural code search model without pre-
training, a within-domain pre-training model CodeBERT [10], and
a cross-language CodeBERT [28] that directly fine-tunes the target
language on a pre-trained model. Experimental results show that
CDCS significant outperforms within-domain counterparts. In par-
ticular, our approach shows more strength when the data is scarce,
indicating the superb effectiveness of our approach in cross-domain
code search.

The contributions of this work can be summarized as:

• We propose CDCS, a novel cross-domain code search method

using few-shot meta learning.

• We extensively evaluate CDCS on a variety of cross-language
code search tasks. Experimental results have shown that
CDCS outperforms the pre-training and fine-tuning coun-
terparts by a large margin.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Code Search Based on Deep Learning
The past few years have witnessed a rapid development of deep
learning for software engineering, in which code search has been
one of the most successful applications. Compared with traditional
text retrieval methods, deep learning based code search learns repre-
sentations of code and natural language using deep neural networks,
and thus has achieved superb performance [4, 10, 14, 15, 27].

Figure 1: Deep learning based code search.

Figure 1 shows the overall framework of deep learning based
code search. In the training phase, a bi-modal deep neural network is
trained based on a large parallel corpus of code and natural language
to learn the semantic representations (high-dimensional vectors)
of both queries and code snippets. Then, a similarity function is
employed to numerically compute the similarity between code and
query vectors. The model is usually trained by minimizing the
triplet ranking loss [26], namely,

L (𝑐, d+, d−) = max(cos(c, d+) − cos(c, d−) + 𝜖, 0)

(1)

Figure 2: Architecture of CodeBERT with masked language
model.

where c, d+, and d− represent the vector representations for the
code, the correct description, and the distracting description, re-
spectively. cos denotes the cosine similarity between two vectors.
𝜖 is a margin which ensures that d+ is at least 𝜖 closer to c than
d− [26].

In the search phase, the search engine is given a query from the
user. It computes the vectors for both the query and code snippets
in the codebase using the trained model. Then, it goes through the
codebase and matches the query with each code snippet according
to their vector distances. Snippets that have the best matching
scores are returned as the search results.

2.2 Pre-trained Models for Code Search
Recently, pre-trained models such as BERT [8] and GPT-2 [25]
have achieved remarkable success in the field of NLP [8, 25]. As
such, researchers start to investigate the adaptation of pre-trained
models to software programs [10? ? ]. Code search is one of the
most successful applications of pre-trained models for programming
languages.

One of the most successful pre-trained models for code is the
CodeBERT [10]. CodeBERT is built on top of BERT [8] and Roberta [20],
two popular pre-trained models for natural language. Unlike pre-
trained models in NLP, CodeBERT is designed to represent bi-modal
data [5], namely, programming and natural languages. Figure 2
shows the architecture of CodeBERT. In general, the model is built
upon a Transformer encoder. The training involves two pre-training
tasks in six programming languages. One is the masked language
modeling (MLM), which trains the model to fill the masked token in
the input sequences. The other task is the replaced token detection
(RTD), which trains the model to detect the replaced tokens in the
input sequences. These two pre-training tasks endow CodeBERT
with generalization ability, so that it can be fine-tuned to adapt to
downstream tasks such as code search and code summarization.

As a code representation model, CodeBERT has been successfully
employed for code search [10]. Specifically, a binary classifier is
employed which takes as input the representation of the [CLS]
token and predicts whether a given <NL, PL> pair is semantically
related. This classifier is then fine-tuned on a code search dataset by
minimizing the cross-entropy loss. In the search phase, the classifier

predicts the matching score between an NL query and each code
snippet in the codebase. The search engine returns the top-𝑘 code
snippets that have the highest matching scores.

Due to the superb performance, researchers have also applied
CodeBERT for cross-language code search [28]. They pre-trained
CodeBERT with multiple languages such as Python, Java, PHP,
Javascript, and Go, and then fine-tuned a code search model on
an unseen language such as Ruby. Results have shown that cross-
language code search achieves better performance than training in a
single language from scratch. This further supports the effectiveness
of transfer learning for code search [28].

2.3 Meta Learning and Few-Shot Learning
Few-shot learning is a machine learning technology that aims to
quickly adapt a trained model to new tasks with less examples [29].
Despite the superb performance, deep learning models are often
data-hungry [12]. They rely on the availability of large-scale data
for training. That means, the performance can be limited due to
the scarcity of data in specific domains [12]. By contrast, humans
can learn knowledge from a few examples. For example, a child can
learn to distinguish between lions and tigers when provided with a
few photos, probably because human beings have prior knowledge
before learning new data or because human brains have a special
way to process knowledge. Based on this intuition, researchers have
proposed few-shot learning.

Few-shot learning methods can be roughly classified into the

following two categories:
1) Metric-based methods, which learn a distance function be-
tween data points so that new test samples can be classified through
comparison with the 𝐾 labeled examples [39]. There are a few typi-
cal algorithms for metric-based few-shot learning, such as Siamese
Network [? ], Prototypical Network [29], and Relation Network [31].
2) Meta Learning, also known as “learning-to-learn”, which trains
a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new
learning tasks using only a small number of training samples [11].
Unlike the conventional machine learning prototype that a model
is optimized in the training set to minimize the training loss, meta
learning updates model parameters using the validation loss in order
to enhance the generalization to different tasks. There are some
typical algorithms for few-shot meta learning, such as MAML [11]
and Reptile [23].

MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) is a few-shot meta learn-
ing algorithm which aims at learning a good initialization of model
parameters so that the model can quickly reach the optimal point in
a new task with a small number of data samples [11, 39]. The algo-
rithm assumes that the data used for training follows a distribution
𝑝 (𝑇 ) over 𝑘 tasks {𝑇1, ...,𝑇𝑘 }, where 𝑇𝑖 stands for a specific machine
learning task on the data. The intuition is that some data features
are more transferrable than others. In other words, they are broadly
applicable to all tasks in 𝑝 (𝑇 ), rather than a single individual task
𝑇𝑖 . To find such general-purpose representations, MAML updates
model parameters that are sensitive to changes in the task, such that
small changes in the parameters will produce large improvements
on the loss function of any task drawn from 𝑝 (𝑇 ). Motivated by
this, MAML separates data into individual tasks. A meta learner
is employed to update parameters using gradients on each local

task 𝑇𝑖 [11]. A more detailed description of the algorithm and how
it is adapted to code search will be presented in Section 3.3.

3 APPROACH
3.1 Overview
Figure 3 shows the architecture of CDCS. In general, CDCS takes
CodeBERT [10] as the backbone, and extends it with a meta learning
phase. The core component of CDCS is RoBERTa [20], which is
built upon a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer [32] encoder.

The pipeline of CDCS involves four phases. Similar to CodeBERT,
we start by pre-training CDCS to learn code representations in
a large corpus of multiple source languages. Next, we perform
meta learning to explicitly transfer the representations of source
languages into the target language. After the domain adaptation, we
fine-tune it on the code search data of the target language in order
to train the semantic mapping between code and natural language.
We finally perform code search using the fine-tuned model. We will
describe the detailed design of each phase in the following sections.

3.2 Pre-training
The pre-training phase aims to learn code and NL representations
from a large corpus of multiple common languages such as Java
and Python. Similar to CodeBERT, we use the pre-training task
of masked language modeling (MLM). We did not use the RTD
(replaced token detection) pre-training task of CodeBERT because
the effect of this task has been shown to be marginal [10].

In the pre-training phase, the model takes as input an ⟨NL, PL⟩

pair which is formatted into a sequence of

[𝐶𝐿𝑆], 𝑤1, 𝑤2, ...𝑤𝑛, [𝑆𝐸𝑃], 𝑐1, 𝑐2, ..., 𝑐𝑚, [𝐸𝑂𝑆]
where 𝑤1, 𝑤2, ..., 𝑤𝑛 denotes a sequence of 𝑛 words in the natural
language text, while 𝑐1, 𝑐2, ..., 𝑐𝑚 represents a sequence of 𝑚 tokens
in the code snippet. The special [𝐶𝐿𝑆] token at the beginning is

a placeholder for the representation of the entire input sequence.
The [𝑆𝐸𝑃] token indicates the border of the code snippet and the
natural language text. The [𝐸𝑂𝑆] token indicates the end of the
sequence.

During the pre-training process, we randomly replace 15% of the
tokens in the input sequence with a special [𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾] token and let
the model predict the original token. The task can be optimized by
minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the predicted and the
original tokens.

The pre-trained model can be used to produce the contextual
vector representation of each token for both natural language de-
scriptions and code snippets. In particular, the representation of
the [𝐶𝐿𝑆] token stands for the aggregated sequence representation
which can be used for classifying the entire input sequence.

3.3 Meta Learning
We next perform meta learning to adapt the pre-trained code model
to the target domain. We employ a meta-learning algorithm named
MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) [11] which is a typical
algorithm for few-shot learning [11, 13, 30]. The key idea of MAML
is to use a set of source tasks {𝑇1,. . ., 𝑇𝑘 } to find the initialization of
parameters 𝜃0 from which learning a target task 𝑇0 would require
only a small number of training samples [11]. In the context of code
search, this amounts to using large data of common languages to
find good initial parameters and training a new code search model
on a small, domain-specific language starting from the found initial
parameters. We formulate code search as a binary classification task
𝑇 which predicts whether a given ⟨𝑁 𝐿, 𝑃𝐿⟩ pair matches (1 = match,
0 = irrelevant). Unlike CodeBERT which directly fine-tunes on the
code search task 𝑇 , the MAML algorithm assumes that the dataset
used for training follows a distribution 𝑝 (𝑇 ) over 𝑘 tasks {𝑇1, ...,𝑇𝑘 }.
Hence, it splits 𝑇 into a set of 𝑘 tasks {𝑇1, ...,𝑇𝑘 }. Each task 𝑇𝑖 aims
at training a code search model with small sized data, therefore
simulates the low-resource learning. Based on this idea, each 𝑇𝑖 is
assigned to train the code search model in a private training and
validation set denoted as 𝑇𝑖 ∼ {𝐷train, 𝐷valid}.

Let 𝜃 denote the global parameters for the entire model and 𝜃𝑖
denote the local parameters for task 𝑇𝑖 . A meta learner is trained
to update model parameters 𝜃𝑖 using one or more gradient descent
updates on task 𝑇𝑖 . For example, when using one gradient update,
the training step can be formulated as

𝜃𝑖 = 𝜃 − 𝛼∇𝜃 𝐿𝑇𝑖 (𝑓𝜃 ),

𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑘

(2)

In order to learn a good model initialization of multiple source
languages, we construct the Dtrain from multiple source languages.
We segment the original dataset of each language into batches. This
results in a pool of batches that involves multiple languages. During
meta learning, we randomly select 𝑘 batches from the batch pool.
The procedure of our algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1.

Figure 4: An overview of the MAML algorithm.

3.4 Fine-Tuning
In the fine-tuning phase, we adapt CDCS to the code search task in
the target language. We fine-tune the model on the code search task,
which can be formulated as a binary classification problem. For a
corpus of ⟨𝑁 𝐿, 𝑃𝐿⟩ pairs, we create the same number of negative
samples by randomly replacing NL or PL in the original pairs. We as-
sign a label to each pair to indicate whether the NL is corresponding
to the PL in the pair (1=relevant, 0 =irrelevant).

ICSE ’22, May 21–29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

For each training instance, we build an input sequence with the
same format as in the pre-training phase. We take the hidden state in
the [𝐶𝐿𝑆] position of CodeBERT as the aggregated representation
of the input sequence. The representation is further taken as input
to a fully connected neural classifier to predict whether the given
⟨𝑁 𝐿, 𝑃𝐿⟩ pair is relevant. We fine-tune the model by minimizing
the binary cross-entropy loss between predictions and labels.

3.5 Domain-Specific Code Search
Finally, we perform code search based on the fine-tuned model in a
domain-specific codebase. The code search engine works with the
following steps:

1) A natural language query 𝑄 is provided to the code search

system.

2) Splice Q separately with each code snippet 𝐶𝑖 in the codebase

to obtain a series of input sequences

< 𝑄, 𝐶1 >, . . . , < 𝑄, 𝐶𝑛 >

3) Input these sequences into the trained model and obtain

their matching scores.

4) Sort code snippets according to their matching scores.
5) Return the top-k code snippets as the results.

4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We evaluate the performance of CDCS in domain-specific code
search tasks and explore the effect of training data size on the
performance. Finally, we extend our method to other backbone
pre-trained models such as GPT-2 [25]. In summary, we evaluate
CDCS by addressing the following research questions:

• RQ1: How effective is CDCS in cross-domain code search?
To verify the effectiveness of CDCS in cross-domain code
search tasks, we take Python and Java as the source lan-
guages and adapt the learned model to two domain-specific
languages, namely, Solidity and SQL. We compare the accu-
racy of code search by various approaches in the two target
languages.

• RQ2: What is the impact of data size on the perfor-

mance of cross-domain code search?
As mentioned, one of the challenges for cross-domain code
search is the scarcity of data in the domain-specific lan-
guage. In RQ2, we aim to study the effect of data size on the
performance. We vary the size of dataset and compare the
performance under different data sizes.

• RQ3: How effective is CDCS applied to other pre-trained

programming language models?
Besides CodeBERT, there are other pre-trained models that
also achieve outstanding results in software engineering
tasks [1, 22, 24]. We wonder whether other pre-trained mod-
els can have the same effectiveness on code search when
equipped with meta learning. We replace the backbone pre-
trained model with GPT-2 [3, 25], which is also a popular
pre-trained language model based on Transformer. GPT-2
differs from BERT in that it is an autoregressive language
model built on top of the Transformer decoder. We evaluate
the effectiveness of CDCSGPT−2 and compare it with those
of baseline models.

• RQ4: How do different hyperparameters affect the per-

formance of CDCS?
In order to study the effect of hyperparameters to the per-
formance of CDCS, we assign different hyperparameters to
CDCS and examine their impact to the performance of code
search.

4.1 Implementation Details
We build our models on top of the RoBERTa [20] using the same
configuration as RoBERTa-base (H=768, A=12, L=12). The rate of
masked tokens is set to 15%. We use the default CodeBERT tokenizer,
namely, Microsoft/codebert-base-MLM with the same vocabulary
size (50265). We set the maximum sequence length to 256 to fit
our maximum computational resources. The default batch size is
set to 64. The three hyperparameters 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝑀 in Algorithm 1 are
empirically set to 1𝑒-5, 1𝑒-4, and 100, respectively. Our experimen-
tal implementation is based on the tool provided by Huggingface
Transformers1 and the higher library provided by Facebook Re-
search2.

All models are trained on a GPU machine with Nvidia Tesla
V100 32G using the Adam [16] algorithm. We use a learning rate
of 5𝑒-5 [10] in the pre-training phase which warms up in the first
1,000 steps and linearly decays. We measure the performance on the
validation set during the training process, and select the checkpoint
of the model which has the best accuracy on the validation set for
testing.

4.2 Datasets
4.2.1 Data Used for Pre-training and Meta Learning. We pre-train
and perform meta learning using the training data for the code
search task provided by CodeBERT [10]. We select two popular
languages, namely, Python and Java as the source languages. The
statistics of the dataset are shown in Table 1. For each language,
the dataset contains parallel data of ⟨NL, PL⟩ pairs, including both
positive and negative samples. In order to prevent the training from
falling into a local optimum of one source language, we use only
positive samples for pre-training and use the entire set of pairs for
meta learning.

4.2.2 Data Used for Fine-tuning and Code Search. We fine-tune
and test the code search task using two domain-specific languages,
namely, Solidity and SQL [36]. The statistics about the datasets are
shown in Table 2.

Solidity is an object-oriented language that is specifically de-
signed for smart contracts [36]. The dataset of Solidity used in our
experiments is provided by [36] for smart contract code summariza-
tion. We preprocess the dataset by removing all inline comments
from functions. We remove duplicate pairs, namely, two ⟨NL, PL⟩
pairs that have the same comment but differ only in the number of
position in the dataset and a few variable names in code. We also
balance positive and negative samples where the negative samples
are generated by randomly replacing NL (i.e. (c, ˆ
d)) and PL (i.e. (ˆc,
d)) of positive samples.

SQL is a well-known language that is specifically designed for
manipulating database systems. The dataset we used for fine-tuning
and testing SQL is provided by [40] for cross-domain semantic
parsing and SQL code generation (text-to-SQL). The original data
is in a JSON format and contains the following fields:
• question: the natural language question.
• question_toks: the natural language question tokens.
• db_id: the database id to which this question is addressed.
• query: the SQL query corresponding to the question.
• query_toks: the SQL query tokens corresponding to the ques-

tion.

• sql: parsed results of this SQL query.

We preprocess the SQL dataset by selecting the “question” and
“query” fields from the .json data as our NL and PL, respectively. We
remove duplicate data that has the same code from the original test
set. We also balance positive and negative samples where the neg-
ative samples are generated by randomly disrupting descriptions
and code based on positive samples.

4.3 Evaluation Metrics
We measure the performance of code search using two popular
quantitative criteria on the test set, including MRR (Mean Recip-
rocal Rank) and the top-𝑘 accuracy. They are commonly used for
evaluating code search engines [10, 14].

MRR [9, 38] aims to let a search algorithm score search results
in turn according to the search content, and then arrange the results
according to the scores in a descend order. For 𝑁 test queries, the
MRR can be computed as

𝑀𝑅𝑅 =

𝑁
∑︁

1
𝑁

1
𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘 (𝑖)

(3)

𝑖=1
where Rank(i) represents the position of the correct code snippet
in the returned results for query 𝑖. The greater the MRR score, the
better the performance on the code search task.

Top-k accuracy measures how many answers in the first 𝑘
results hit the query. This metric is close to the real-world scenario
of search tasks, that is, users want the most matching results to be

placed at the top of the results. In our experiments, we compute
the top-𝑘 accuracy with 𝑘 = 1, 5, and 10, respectively.

We use the trained model to predict the matching scores of 1,000
⟨𝑁 𝐿, 𝑃𝐿⟩ pairs in the test set. For each pair, the model computes
the similarities between the text description and all 1,000 code
snippets. The top-k similar snippets are selected for calculating
the evaluation metrics. We report the average score of all the 1,000
pairs in the test set.

4.4 Comparison Methods
We compare our approach with four baseline methods.

(1) Code Search without Pre-training, which trains the code
search model using only domain-specific data in Table 2
without pre-training and meta learning. Through comparing
to this baseline model, we aim to verify the effectiveness of
pre-training and meta learning in our approach.

(2) Code Search based on pre-trained model with Natural
Language, which fine-tunes the code search model on the
domain-specific data in Table 2 based on the pre-trained
model that is initialized by the natural language pre-training
models, namely Roberta [20] and GPT-2 [25].

(3) Within-domain Code Search with CodeBERT [10], which
pre-trains and fine-tunes only with the domain-specific data
in Table 2 without prior knowledge of common languages.
(4) Cross-Language Code Search with CodeBERT [28], which
directly fine-tunes the code search model on the domain-
specific data (Table 2) on a model that is pre-trained on
the data of multiple common languages (Table 1). Through
comparing to this baseline model, we aim to validate the
usefulness of meta learning in our approach.

We implement all baseline models based on the open source code
of CodeBERT3 using the same hyperparameters as in the CodeBERT
paper [10].

5.1 Effectiveness in Cross-Domain Deep Code

Search (RQ1)

Table 3 and 4 show the performance of different approaches in the
cross-domain code search task. We take Python and Java as the
source languages and test the performance on two domain-specific
languages, namely, SQL and Solidity.

Overall, CDCS achieves the best performance among all the
methods. From the results on the SQL dataset, we can see that
CDCS outperforms the baseline models in terms of all metrics,

especially the top-1 accuracy and MRR, which are about 11% and
7% greater than the strong baselines, respectively.

The improvement is more significant on the Solidity dataset
(Table 4). We can see that CDCS substantially outperforms strong
baselines especially in the top-1 accuracy and MRR, which are about
20% and 18% stronger, respectively.

There is a large margin between CodeBERT (NL-based) and
CodeBERT (within-domain). We hypothesize that this is because the
SQL corpus is too scarce, so that the pre-training may not provide
sufficient prior knowledge to the code-search model. CDCS obtains
more significant improvement against CodeBERT (NL-based) in
SQL than that in the Solidity dataset, probably because SQL is much
closer to natural language than Solidity.

The results demonstrate that CDCS is remarkably effective in

domain-specific code search tasks.

5.2 Effect of Data Size (RQ2)
Figure 5 and 6 show the performance of CDCS under different data
sizes compared with the cross-language CodeBERT [28]. We vary
the size of training data from 0 to full data.

As the result shows, CDCS outperforms the baseline model under
all data sizes, which supports the significance of the improvement
achieved by CDCS. In particular, we note that when the data size
gets smaller (e.g., <500), the improvement of CDCS against the
baseline model becomes more significant. That means that CDCS
is particularly effective in scarce data, indicating the outstanding
ability of CDCS on domain specific languages. By contrast, the
baseline model without meta learning can not adapt to the task
well due to the insufficiency of data.

5.4 Impact of Different Hyperparameters (RQ4)
Figure 7(a) and 7(b) show the performance of CDCS under different
batch sizes on the SQL and Solidity datasets. We vary batch sizes
to 64, 32, 16 and 8, respectively. The results show that larger batch
sizes have slight impact on the performance, while smaller batch
sizes have evident effect on the performance.

Figure 7(c) and 7(d) show the performance of CDCS under dif-
ferent learning rates on the SQL and Solidity datasets. We vary the
learning rate to 2𝑒-5, 1𝑒-5, and 5𝑒-6, respectively. As we can see,
the performance is insensitive to learning rates lower than 1𝑒-5.
However, learning rates that are larger than 1𝑒-5 have significant
impacts on performance.

To sum up, the impact of hyperparameters on CDCS is limited
to a certain range. The performance is sensitive to the hyperpa-
rameters when the batch size is less than 32 or the learning rate is
greater than 1𝑒-5. In addition, our model is more sensitive to both
batch size and learning rate on the Solidity dataset than SQL.

5.5 Case Study
We now provide specific search examples to demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of CDCS in domain specific code search.

Listing 1 and 2 compare the top-1 results for the query “what
is the smallest city in the USA” returned by CDCS and the cross-
language CodeBERT, respectively. The query involves complex
semantics such as the word smallest. A code search system is
expected to associate “small” with the corresponding SQL keyword
MIN. They are different but are semantically relevant. Listing 1
shows that CDCS can successfully understand the semantics of
smallest, while the cross-language CodeBERT cannot. The exam-
ple suggests that CDCS is better than the cross-language Code-
BERT [28] in terms of semantic understanding.

Listing 3 and 4 show the results returned by CDCS and the cross-
language CodeBERT for the query “Reset all the balances to 0 and
the state to false” in the Solidity language. The keywords in the
query are balances, state, and false. It can be seen that both
approaches return code snippets that hit some of the keywords.
However, the snippet returned by CDCS is clearly more relevant
than that returned by the cross-language CodeBERT. For example,
it explicitly states benificiary.balance=0 and filled = false
in the source code. On the other hand, the snippet provided by the
cross-language CodeBERT is vague in semantics. Cross-language
CodeBERT may pay more attention to similar words and is limited
in understanding semantics.

These examples demonstrate the superiority of CDCS in cross-
domain code search, affirming the strong ability of learning repre-
sentations at both token and semantic levels.

in the USA" returned by CDCS.

Solidity and SQL. The training differs a little bit in the meta learning
phase: we formulate the input for code search as:

[𝐵𝑂𝑆], 𝑤1, . . . , 𝑤𝑁 , 𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑚, [𝐸𝑂𝑆]

where [𝐵𝑂𝑆] and [𝐸𝑂𝑆] represent the “beginning” and “ending” of
the sequence, respectively. The representation of the [𝐸𝑂𝑆] token
stands for the aggregated sequence representation and is used for
classification. We implement CDCSGPT based on the Huggineface
repository1. The hyperparameters are set as follows: we set the
batch size to 44, learning rate to 2.5𝑒-4 [25] which warms up in the
first 1,000 steps and decays according to a cosine curve.

Table 5 shows the performance of CDCSGPT−2 compared against
baseline models. Clearly, CDCSGPT−2 works better than all the base-
line models. The MRR scores of CDCSGPT−2 are about 5% and 10%
greater than those of the baseline model in the SQL and Solidity lan-
guages, respectively. This affirms the effectiveness of CDCSGPT−2
when equipped with meta learning.

We notice that the GPT-2 pre-trained in natural language corpus
shows a comparable performance to ours in the SQL language. We
conjecture that SQL is simple and similar to natural languages,
hence pre-training on massive text corpus is effective for the target
task without heavy adaptation. Another notable point we observe is
that the results of CDCSGPT−2 are lower than those of CDCSBERT,
presumably because GPT-2 is a unidirectional language model,
which dynamically estimates the probability of text sequences and
can be more suitable for generation than search tasks. GPT-2 pro-
cesses each input text from left to right sequentially, thus can be lim-
ited in representing context-sensitive features. By contrast, BERT-
style models are trained with de-noising strategies (e.g., the MLM
task) which enable them to obtain bidirectional, context-sensitive
features.

5.6 Summary
Across all the experiments, the performance of the experimental
group using pre-training is better than those without pre-training,
and the evaluation results of the CDCS experimental group com-
bined with meta learning are better than those only trained with
pre-training and fine-tuning. These results suggest that both trans-
fer learning (pre-training & fine-tuning) and meta learning have
significant efficacy in deep code search.

The advantages of meta learning can be particularly seen from
the experimental results of RQ2. The accuracy gap between CDCS
and the baseline models is becoming more significant as the data
size decreases, which means that the size of training data has little
effect on CDCS. Furthermore, the results of RQ3 suggest that our
approach can be generalized to other pre-trained models such as
GPT-2.

Overall, the experimental results suggest that CDCS has remark-
able effectiveness in cross-domain code search especially when the
training data is scarce.

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Why does CDCS work better than the

cross-language CodeBERT?

We believe that the advantage of CDCS mainly comes from the
difference between meta learning and simply pre-training & fine
tuning. As Figure 8 illustrates, the traditional pre-training & fine-
tuning paradigm tries to learn the common features of multiple
source languages in the pre-training phase, and directly reuses the
pre-trained parameters to specific tasks through fine-tuning. The
features of different source languages distract each other, leading
to an ill-posed representation to be reused by the target language.
By contrast, meta learning employed by CDCS tries to adapt the
pre-trained parameters to new tasks during the learning process,
resulting in representations that take into account all source lan-
guages.

In a view of machine learning, both the pre-training & fine-tuning
paradigm and meta learning aim to enhance the generalization
ability of deep neural networks in multiple tasks. However, in the
pre-training & fine-tuning paradigm, the model will not obtain task
information before fine-tuning on specific downstream tasks, while
meta learning focuses on learning information in specific tasks
and can enhance the generalization ability of the model. CDCS
successfully combines the two methods.

6.2 Limitations
Although effective, we recognize that the adaptation of meta-learning
to code search might not be a perfect fit. Meta-learning is usually
used for classification tasks on scarce data [11, 39], whereas we
adapt it to the context of code search. These two concepts (i.e., clas-
sification vs. ranking) are not a natural fit. Hence, meta-learning
might not perfectly solve the root problem of cross-domain code
search. More adaptations are demanded to fit the two concepts.

In order to efficiently adapt code search tasks to scarce data
scenarios, we follow the MAML paper [11] and divide the data into
machine learning “tasks”, with each task aiming at training a code
search model with small sized data. Such an approach has a few
benefits. For example, it is easy for task adaptations since it does
not introduce any learned parameters. Furthermore, adaptation can
be performed with any amount of data since it aims at producing
an optimal weight initialization [11]. The limitation is that, the
division of the data into “tasks” is random and there needs a concrete
explanation on how split tasks are related to cross-language code
search. It remains to investigate how such divisions turn out to be
effective in scarce data.

Another downside of CDCS is that the MAML algorithm it em-
ploys can bring more time and computational cost in the large-scale
data set. Different from the conventional gradient descent methods,
MAML needs to compute a meta gradient based on multiple losses
computed from sub-tasks. This costs extra time for saving model
parameters and gathering meta gradients. For example, in our ex-
periments, it requires around 50% extra hours for meta-learning

compared to the baseline models. We leave more efficient transfer
learning techniques for future directions.

6.3 Threats to Validity
We have identified the following threats to our approach:

The number of source languages. Due to the restriction of compu-
tational resources, we only selected two source languages and two
domain-specific target languages. Meta learning with more source
languages could have different results. In our future work, we will
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach with more source and
target languages.

The selection of pre-training tasks. The original CodeBERT uses
two pre-training tasks, namely, masked language model (MLM) and
replaced token detection (RTD) [10]. However, in our experiments,
we only use the MLM as the pre-training task. Combining MLM
with RTD may have effects on the results. However, we believe
that the results of the MLM task can stand for the performance
of pre-training because the objective of RTD is similar to MLM in
that both are based on the idea of de-noising. More importantly,
the RTD task requires too much cost of time and computational
resources, while the improvement it brings is marginal according
to the ablation experiments in the CodeBERT paper [10]. Moreover,
compared with RTD, the MLM task is more widely used [33] in
domains other than programming languages.

Generalization to other pre-trained models. We have built and
evaluated our approach on top of two pre-trained models, namely,
BERT and GPT-2. Thus, it remains to be verified whether or not
the proposed approach is applicable to other pre-trained models
such as BART [1] and T5 [22? ].

7 RELATED WORK
7.1 Deep Learning Based Code Search
With the development of deep learning, there is a growing inter-
est in adapting deep learning to code search [4, 14, 19]. The main
idea of deep learning based code search is to map natural and pro-
gramming languages into high-dimensional vectors using bi-modal
deep neural networks, and train the model to match code and nat-
ural language according to their vector similarities. NCS (Neural
Code Search) [27] proposed by Facebook learns the embeddings of
code using unsupervised neural networks. Gu et al. [14] proposed
CODEnn (Code-Description Embedding Neural Network), which
learns the joint embedding of both code and natural language. CO-
DEnn learns code representations by encoding three individual
channels of source code, namely, method names, API sequences,

and code tokens. UNIF [4] developed by Facebook can be regarded
as a supervised version of NCS. Similar to CODEnn, UNIF designs
two embedding networks to encode natural and programming lan-
guages, respectively. Semantic Code Search (SCS) [15] first trains
natural language embedding network and programming language
embedding network respectively and then trains the code search
task by integrating the two embedding network with similarity
function. CodeMatcher [19], which is inspired by DeepCS [14],
combines query keywords with the original order and performs a
fuzzy search on method names and bodies. Zhu et al. [42] proposed
OCoR, a code retriever that handles the overlaps between differ-
ent names used by different developers (e.g., “message” and “msg”).
Wang et al. [34] proposed to enrich query semantics for code search
with reinforcement learning.

While these methods are mainly designed for common languages,
CDCS focuses on domain-specific code search, where training data
is often scarce and costly. CDCS extends pre-trained models with
meta learning to extract prior knowledge from popular common pro-
gramming language for searching code written in domain-specific
languages.

7.2 Pre-trained Language Models for Code
In recent years, pre-trained language models for source code have
received much attention [1, 10, 22, 24]. CodeBERT [10], built on
top of the popular model of BERT [8], is one of the earliest at-
tempts that adapt pre-trained models for programming languages.
CodeBERT is trained with six common programming languages
(Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Go). Besides, they cre-
atively proposed the replaced token detection (RTD) task for the
pre-training of programming language. CoText [24] is a pre-trained
Transformer model for both natural language and programming
languages. It follows the encoder-decoder architecture proposed
by [32]. PLBART [1] learns multilingual representations of pro-
gramming and natural language jointly. It extends the scope of pre-
training to denoising pre-training, which involves token masking,
deletion, and infilling. Mastropaolo et al. [22] empirically investi-
gated how T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), one of the state-
of-the-art PLMs in NLP, can be adapted to support code-related
tasks. The authors pre-trained T5 using a dataset composed of Eng-
lish texts and source code, and then fine-tuned the model in four
code-related tasks such as bug fix and code comment generation.
Although these pre-trained models for source code can be used
for cross-language code search [28] through pre-training in multiple
languages and fine-tuning in the domain-specific language, they
do not take into account the difference between source and target

languages, and are limited in performing domain-specific code
search. By contrast, CDCS explicitly transfers representations of
multiple source languages to the target language through meta
learning.

7.3 Transfer Learning for Code Search
To our knowledge, there is only one previous work that is closely
related to ours. Salza et al. [28] investigated the effectiveness of
transfer learning for code search. They built a BERT-based model,
which we refer to as cross-language CodeBERT, to examine how
BERT pre-trained on source code of multiple languages can be
transferred to code search tasks of another language. Their results
show that the pre-trained model performs better than those without
pre-training, and transfer learning is particularly effective in cases
where a large amount of data is available for pre-training while
data for fine-tuning is insufficient [28].

CDCS differs significantly from theirs. We employ a meta learn-
ing algorithm to explicitly adapt the parameters from source lan-
guages to the target domain, while their work directly fine-tunes
the pre-trained model in the target language.

8 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present CDCS, a cross-domain code search ap-
proach that reuses prior knowledge from large corpus of common
languages to domain-specific languages such as SQL and Solid-
ity. CDCS extends pre-trained models such as CodeBERT with
meta learning. It employs a meta-learning algorithm named MAML
which learns a good initialization of model parameters so that the
model can quickly reach the optimal point in a new task with a
few data samples. Experimental results show that CDCS achieves
significant improvement in domain-specific code search, compared
to “pre-training & fine-tuning” counterparts. In the future, we will
investigate our method in more languages and other software engi-
neering tasks.
