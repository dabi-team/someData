Abstract

Energy loss of energetic ions in solid is crucial in many ﬁeld, and accurate prediction of the ion

stopping power is a long-time goal. Though great eﬀorts have been made, it is still very diﬃcult to

ﬁnd a universal prediction model to accurately calculate the ion stopping power in distinct target

materials. Deep learning algorithm is a newly emerged method to solve multi-factors physical

problems and can mine the deeply implicit relations among parameters, which make it a powerful

tool in energy loss prediction. In this work, we developed an energy loss prediction model based

on deep learning. When experimental data are available, our model can give predictions with an

average absolute diﬀerence close to 5.7%, which is in the same level compared with other widely

used programs e.g. SRIM. In the regime without experimental data, our model still can maintain

a high performance, and has higher reliability compared with the existing models. The ion range

of Au ions in SiC can be calculated with a relative error of 0.6∼25% for ions in the energy range of

700∼10’000 keV, which is much better than the results calculated by SRIM. Moreover, our model

support the reciprocity conjecture of ion stopping power in solid proposed by P. Sigmund, which

has been known for a long time but can hardly been proved by any of the existing stopping power

models. This high-accuracy energy loss prediction model is very important for the research of

ion-solid interaction mechanism and enormous relevant applications of energetic ions, such as in

semiconductor fabrications, nuclear energy systems and the space facilities.

In the past century, the energy loss of energetic ions in matter has been signiﬁcant subject

which received great attention, since this topic is important no matter for the scientiﬁc

researches or industrial applications, including radiation damage, material analysis by using

ion beams, nuclear physics, ion implantation and nano-device modiﬁcation [1–4]. For these

reasons, enormous experimental measurements and plenty of theoretical studies, by Bethe

[5], Bloch [6], Lindhard [7], Sigmund [8], Ziegler [9] and et al., have been carried out to

achieve a better description of ion stopping power, which can be deﬁned as the energy loss

in unit distance per atom. Meanwhile, many code, like SRIM [10–12] and MSTAR [13, 14],

have been developed to calculate these values and simulate the ion transportation behavior

in solids.

Energy loss of energetic ions in solid is complicated: both the ion parameters and solid

properties may aﬀect the energy transfer process. Many researches have proved that the

electronic stopping power is a complex function of collision parameters, including atomic

number and mass for incident ion (Z1, M1) and target material (Z2, M1), along with the

kinetic energy of incident ion (Ein). Besides, the contribution of other factors, such as bind-

ing energy, state of matter, electron structure, band gap and excitation energy, also have

already been proved to be very important for the stopping process [1, 2, 15–17]. However,

nearly all the widely accepted empirical energy loss models only consider the inﬂuence of

collision parameters during the ﬁtting and optimizing of these models, and therefore, their

prediction accuracy and transferability are fundamentally restricted. Moreover, limited by

the ion source technique and measuring diﬃculties, the experimental data of some speciﬁc

ion types or energy ranges are nearly impossible to be measured by far, which means the pre-

diction accuracy can hardly been further improved by increasing the experimental database

for these existing methods based on semi-theoretical formulas. A new method which can

overcome these problems has been desired for many years.

Deep Learning (DL) is a new computational method which is composed of multiple pro-

cessing layers to represent data with multi-levels of abstraction [18]. It is widely believed

to be good at solving multi-parameters problems and mining the deeply implicit relations

among these data. The algorithm of DL has already brought about breakthroughs in many

ﬁelds of science, e.g. planning chemical syntheses [19], acceleration of super-resolution local-

ization microscopy [20–22], classifying scientiﬁc data [23, 24] and solving high-dimensional

problems in condensed matter system [25–29]. Considering the large number of energy loss

3

data obtained in the past decades, it can be expected that DL based model can provide

higher accuracy and better transferability than traditional methods, such as SRIM and

MSTAR, which are strongly relay on some artiﬁcially selected stopping power formulas or

highly approximate ﬁtting functions.

In this letter, we demonstrated that DL provides a good breakthrough point to inroad

nuclear technology and particle physics. The proposed Deep Learning based Electronic

Stopping Power (DL-ESP) model can provide good accuracy, whose average relative absolute

diﬀerence between predict and experimental results can reach 5.7%. More importantly, this

model shows much higher accuracy at regime without experimental data than the existing

models. Furthermore, DL-ESP model provides evidence of the so call reciprocity principle

proposed by P. Sigmund [30], and also can give a much better prediction in evaluating the

projected range of Au ion in SiC.

To deploy DL-ESP, we used the experimental ion collision data collected by H. Paul

and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which contain nearly all the published

electronic stopping power data of diﬀerent ion in solids, gases and compounds, since the

1990’s [31, 32]. 16’907 experimental data of energy loss of energetic ions, whose kinetic energy

between 5 keV/u to 100 MeV, in elementary substance were selected, and 13’526 (80%) of

them were randomly chosen as training database, while the rest 3’381 (20%) were used for

validation. Besides, in order to verify the DP-ESP model still can make prediction accurately

while the experimental data for a certain ion are totally absent, all the experimental data of

Ti ion and Kr ion in Al, were excluded from the training database. To simplify the problem,

we also do not consider the crystal structure of target materials in the current work.

Following previous studies, we assumed that the electronic stopping power (Se) is only

related with Z1, M1, Z2, M2 and Ein. According to our test, a 5 layer network with grid of

16×32×64×32×16 is good enough to give the required accuracy. All the DL-ESP model,

including the generating, training and invoking of neural network, was built based on Keras

[33] with TensorFlow [34] platform as the back-end.

In order to balance the prediction

performance for Ein at both high and low energy range, the mean absolute percentage error

(MAPE) loss function was adopted, instead of the mean absolute error (MAE) loss functions.

Moreover, we chose the rectiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) activate function [35] and the adaptive

moment estimation (Adam) optimizer [36] to make the network easier to be converged. We

export the DL-ESP model which has the smallest validate loss during the training process,

data and boundary points.

and invoked it at the following exploration and discussion. A simple illustration of our

method can be shown as FIG. 1.

Since most of the experimental ion (except H and He) stopping power lack of low energy

data, 12’800 boundary points were also included in training database, in order to maintain

the accuracy of boundary at extreme low energy range. These points were generated by

using LSS model, which is widely believed to be accurate enough for low-velocity ion through

matter [7, 37–39]:

in which the unit of Se and Ein is 10−15 eVcm2/atom and keV. By using Eq. (1), Se of 80

diﬀerent kinds of ions, with the incident energy of 1 and 10 keV, in 80 types of elementary

materials were calculated, then used as boundary points only in training database. In the

following study, the results of SRIM were used as a benchmark to compare with the accuracy

of DP-ESP, because SRIM is the most widely used simulation software for the stopping and

range of ions in materials. Moreover, we also investigated the inﬂuence of input parameters,

by exploring a simpliﬁed version of DL-ESP (DL-ESP-Simple) with the minimum input

parameters (Z1, Z2, Ein). A detailed comparison between these two models was discussed

in Supplementary Material.

5.7%, quite close to the performance of SRIM (4.6%), and better than MSTAR (about

1∼2% at high energy, but for low energy ions it increase to 10∼20% [14]). As for the general

consistency within 5% and 10%, which can be deﬁned as the percentage of experimental

data whose predicted value with absolute relative diﬀerence (|σ|) smaller than 5% and 10%,

SRIM and DL-ESP have similar performance, especially for incident ion heavier than He.

To verify the transferability of DL-ESP, we calculated the predicted Se for some experi-

mental points which were excluded from the entire database, especially the data of medium-

heavy ions, as shown in FIG. 2. It could be demonstrated from FIG. 2 that DL-ESP exhibit

extraordinary agreement for these extra experimental results, such as Ti and Kr in Al, along

with additional data of H in Fe and Zn as representatives. Although these data points were

not included in neither training nor validate database, this model can provide the prediction

curve with high accuracy only based on nearby data, which means its transferability can be

greatly improved if more training data with abundant atomic and energy information were

introduced into the system.

As discussed before, this model is established based on LSS model (boundary points for

low energy ions) and experimental data (for ions’ Ein > 5 keV/u), so it is also very important

to evaluate the necessity and accuracy of this treatment. FIG. 2 (c) and (d) can illustrate

the ability of extension of this model at low energy range, especially when 1 keV/u < Ein <

10 keV/u. Though we didn’t import any experimental data (whose Ein is smaller than 5

keV/u) into the deep learning network, DL-ESP can still give an accurate enough prediction

at this energy range, with high consistency compared with both SRIM and experimental

results. Therefore it can be concluded from FIG. 2 that the DL-ESP model has the ability of

extrapolation to a certain extent, with the help of boundary point generated by LSS model,

and this treatment is necessary and helpful when there is no enough experimental data for

low energy ions.

Moreover, it can be shown from TABLE I that the data of heavy ions only took a relatively

In fact, other calculation models, such as SRIM and MSTAR, also face the similar problem:

it has been already discussed from other researchers that the electronic stopping cross section

of some ultra-heavy ion, e.g. Au, is overestimated by SRIM when Ein near 1000 keV/u [40],

as illustrated in FIG. 3. The abnormal high Se at extreme low energy (about 140 in the

unit of 10−15 eVcm2/atom for 1 keV/u Au ion in Al) is also quite controversial, because the

low energy models of heavy ions used in SRIM are simply extrapolate the ﬁtting curve of

light ions, which would cause obvious deviation systematically. As for DL-ESP, the network

would establish extrapolation based on the nearby data points, so the behavior of Se curve

for Au ion at low energy range is much more reasonable than SRIM.

It should also be noted that the high accuracy of SRIM is based on segment ﬁtting

functions for diﬀerent mass and energy range, so it can provide well consistence with existing

experimental results. However, for the regime that lack the support of data, the accuracy of

these ﬁtting functions becomes quite controversial, because they may neglect the inﬂuence

of other potential factors. According to the discussion in Supplementary Material, the

tiny diﬀerence between DL-ESP and DL-ESP-Simple reveals that DL network can indeed

mining the inline relations deeply hiding in these experimental data, which could signiﬁcantly

enhance the transferability of this model. Therefore, though DL-ESP can hardly achieve

higher overall accuracy than SRIM, its ¯σ is a macroscopic evaluation of the entire database

equally for each atom types and energy ranges.

In other words, DL-ESP would possess

excellent transferability since it would have similar accuracy for the conditions which are

shortage of experimental data theoretically.

FIG. 3 also plotted the Se curve of Al in Au, to demonstrate Sigmund’s reciprocity

theory, in which he believed that when ion’s velocity smaller than Bohr’s velocity (c/137 =

2.088×106 m/s, about 22.75 keV/u), the electronic stopping power of A ion in B material

is equal to B ion in A: Se(A in B) = Se(B in A) [30]. So far, this conjecture is actually

correct for all the existing experimental results, but it can hardly be proved theoretically or

experimentally, due to the limit of experimental techniques. However, it is widely accepted

to use Sigmund’s reciprocity theory to evaluate the rationality of newly emerged results.

This DL-ESP model can support Sigmund’s conjecture, and a more detailed investigation

about reciprocity theory is explored in the Supplementary Material.

To further demonstrate the accuracy for DL-ESP, we systemically calculated the projected

FIG. 3. According to SRIM’s calculation, there is an obvious diﬀerence between Se(Au in Al)

and Se(Al in Au) at low energy range. While for DL-ESP, the predicted Se curves are basically

coincident, and the Se values at low energy range are signiﬁcantly lower than SRIM’s results.

range (Rp) by DL-ESP and SRIM, compared with experimental results, as shown in FIG. 4.

To minimize the inﬂuence of nuclear stopping power (Sn), the Sn used in this work is also

calculated by SRIM, so the diﬀerence exhibited in FIG. 4 only represents the contribution

of Se. The calculation of ion range by using DL-ESP model is mainly based on the Bragg’s

theory [41] (to convert Se of elementary materials into compounds) and Lindhard formula

[42] (to evaluate Rp by using Se and Sn), detail information about the calculation has also

been illustrated in Supplementary Material.

It can be shown in FIG. 4 that, the predicted Rp from DL-ESP and SRIM are all very close

to the experimental result when Ein is small enough. However, when Ein becomes greater,

the DL-ESP’s results could still agree well with the experimental data, while Rp from SRIM

calculation became less accurate compared with DL-ESP: the Rp of 700∼5000 keV Au in

SiC predicted by SRIM are about 20∼40% lower than experimental results [43], and for high

energy range, the diﬀerence becomes more evident, mainly due to the incorrectly estimated

stopping power. Similar deviation can also be seen in the result of Cs in SiO2 [44].

In conclusion, we developed a new electronic stopping power model based on deep learn-

ing method to describe ion’s electronic energy loss in elementary materials. Compared with

traditional method, deep learning can extensively avoid the systematic error generated by

ﬁtting model, capture more detailed information of experimental data, and completely erad-

icate the interference of subjective factors. All these features makes DL-ESP exhibit high

accuracy and good transferability even with small size of database. This model can not

only increase the prediction accuracy of ion projected range, but also provide a new insight

to challenge the classical puzzles, such as the reciprocity conjecture which can hardly be

veriﬁed experimentally or theoretically. These ﬁndings should be of great importance for

fundamentally understanding the novel physical phenomena related to the ion interaction

with materials, and could be extensively necessary for vast relevant areas, such as semicon-

ductor industry and nano-structures preparation.
