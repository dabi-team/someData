ABSTRACT
Chronicling America is a product of the National Digital
Newspaper Program, a partnership between the Library of
Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities
to digitize historic newspapers. Over 16 million pages of
historic American newspapers have been digitized for Chroni-
cling America to date, complete with high-resolution images
and machine-readable METS/ALTO OCR. Of considerable
interest to Chronicling America users is a semantiﬁed cor-
pus, complete with extracted visual content and headlines. To
accomplish this, we introduce a visual content recognition
model trained on bounding box annotations of photographs,
illustrations, maps, comics, and editorial cartoons collected
as part of the Library of Congress’s Beyond Words crowd-
sourcing initiative and augmented with additional annotations
including those of headlines and advertisements. We describe
our pipeline that utilizes this deep learning model to extract
7 classes of visual content: headlines, photographs, illustra-
tions, maps, comics, editorial cartoons, and advertisements,
complete with textual content such as captions derived from
the METS/ALTO OCR, as well as image embeddings for fast

image similarity querying. We report the results of running
the pipeline on 16.3 million pages from the Chronicling Amer-
ica corpus and describe the resulting Newspaper Navigator
dataset, the largest dataset of extracted visual content from
historic newspapers ever produced. The Newspaper Navigator
dataset, ﬁnetuned visual content recognition model, and all
source code are placed in the public domain for unrestricted
re-use.

INTRODUCTION
Chronicling America, an initiative of the National Digital
Newspaper Program - itself a partnership of the Library of
Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities -
is an invaluable resource for academic, local, and public his-
torians; educators and students; genealogists; journalists; and
members of the public to explore American history through the
uniquely rich content preserved within historic local newspa-
pers. Over 16 million pages of newspapers published between
1789 to 1963 are publicly available online through a search
portal, as well as via a public API. Among the page-level data
are 400 DPI images, as well as METS/ALTO OCR, a stan-
dard maintained by the Library of Congress that includes text
localization [2].

The 16.3 million Chronicling America pages included in the
Newspaper Navigator cover 174 years of American history,
inclusive of 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. In
Figure 1, we show choropleth maps displaying the geographic
coverage of the 16.3 million Chronicling America newspaper
pages included in the Newspaper Navigator dataset. In Fig-
ure 2, we show the temporal coverage of these pages. The
coverage reﬂects the selection process for determining which
newspapers to include in Chronicling America; for an in-depth

 
 
 
 
 
 
examination, please refer to [26, 55]. The selection process
should be considered in the methodology of any research per-
formed using the Newspaper Navigator dataset.

While the images and OCR in Chronicling America provide
a wealth of information, users interested in extracted visual
content, including headlines, are currently restricted to general
keyword searches or manual searches over individual pages
in Chronicling America. For example, staff at the Library
of Congress have produced a collection of Civil War maps
in historic newspapers to date, but the collection is far from
complete due to the difﬁculty of manually searching over the
hundreds of thousands of Chronicling America pages from
1861 to 1865 [7]. A complete dataset would be of immense
value to historians of the Civil War. Likewise, collecting all of
the comic strips from newspapers published in the early 20th
century would provide comic researchers with a corpus of un-
precedented scale. In addition, users currently have no reliable
method of determining what disambiguated articles appear on
each page, presenting challenges for natural language process-
ing (NLP) approaches to studying the corpus. A dataset of
extracted headlines not only gives researchers insight into the
individual articles that appear on each page but also enables
users to ask questions such as, “Which news topics appeared
above the fold versus below the fold in what newspapers?”
Indeed, the digital humanities questions that could be asked
with such a dataset abound. And yet, the possibilities extend
beyond the digital humanities to include public history, cre-
ative computing, educational use within the classroom, and
public engagement with the Library of Congress’s collections.

To begin the construction of larger datasets of visual content
within Chronicling America and to engage the American pub-
lic, the Library of Congress Labs launched a crowdsourcing
initiative called Beyond Words1 in 2017. With this initiative,
volunteers were asked to draw bounding boxes around pho-
tographs, illustrations, comics, editorial cartoons, and maps
in World War 1-era newspapers in Chronicling America; they
were also asked to transcribe captions by correcting the OCR
within each bounding box annotation, as well as record the
content creator. Approximately 10,000 veriﬁed Beyond Words
annotations have been collected to date.

Our research builds on the crowdsourced Beyond Words an-
notations by utilizing the bounding boxes drawn around pho-
tographs, illustrations, comics, editorial cartoons, and maps,
as well as additional annotations including ones marking head-
lines and advertisements, to ﬁnetune a pre-trained Faster-
RCNN implementation from Detectron2’s Model Zoo [58,
76]. Our visual content recognition model predicts bound-
ing boxes around these 7 different classes of visual content
in historic newspapers. This paper presents our work train-
ing this visual content recognition model and constructing a
pipeline for automating the identiﬁcation of this visual content
in Chronicling America newspaper pages. Drawing inspiration
from the Beyond Words workﬂow, we extract corresponding
textual content such as headlines and captions by identifying
text from the METS/ALTO OCR that falls within each pre-
dicted bounding box. This method is effective at captioning

1https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/beyond-words/

because Beyond Words volunteers were asked to include cap-
tions and relevant textual content within their bounding box
annotations. Lastly, in order to enable fast similarity querying
for search and recommendation tasks, we generate image em-
beddings for the extracted visual content using ResNet-18 and
ResNet-50 models pre-trained on ImageNet. This resulting
dataset, which we call the Newspaper Navigator dataset, is
the largest collection of extracted visual content from historic
newspapers ever produced.

Our contributions are as follows:

1. We present a publicly available pipeline for extracting visual
and textual content from historic newspaper pages, designed
to run at scale over terabytes of image data. Visual con-
tent categories include headlines, photographs, illustrations,
maps, comics, editorial cartoons, and advertisements.

2. We release into the public domain a ﬁnetuned Faster-RCNN
model for this task that achieves 63.4% bounding box mean
average precision (mAP)2 on a validation set of World War
1-era Chronicling America pages.

3. We present the Newswpaper Navigator dataset, a new pub-
lic dataset of extracted headlines and visual content, as well
as corresponding textual content such as titles and captions,
produced by running the pipeline over 16.3 million his-
toric newspaper pages in Chronicling America. This corpus
represents the largest dataset of its kind ever produced.

RELATED WORK

Corpora & Datasets
Over the past 15 years, efforts across the world to digitize
historic newspapers have been remarkably successful [52]. In
addition to Chronicling America, examples of large reposito-
ries of digitized newspapers include Trove [23], Europeana
[54, 75], Delpher [3], The British Newspaper Archive [6],
OurDigitalWorld [12], Papers Past [13], NewspaperSG [22],
newspapers.com [5] and Google Newspaper Search [24]. The
availability of newspapers at the scale of millions of digitized
pages has inspired the construction of datasets for supervised
learning tasks related to digitized newspapers. In addition
to Beyond Words, datasets for historic newspaper recogni-
tion include the National Library of Luxembourg’s historic
newspaper datasets [8] that include segmented articles and
advertisements; CHRONIC, a dataset of 452,543 images in
historic Dutch newspapers [67]; and Europeana’s SIAMESET,
a dataset of 426,777 advertisements in historic Dutch newspa-
pers [73]. Datasets for machine learning tasks with historical
documents include READ-BAD [33] and DIVA-HisDB [61].
However, all of these datasets are designed to serve as training
sets rather than as comprehensive datasets of extracted content
from full corpora. Our work instead seeks to use the Beyond
Words dataset to train a visual content recognition model in
order to process the visual content in the Chronicling America
corpus comprising 16+ million historic newspaper pages.

2Mean average precision is the standard metric used for benchmark-
ing object detection models, incorporating intersection over union to
assess precision and recall. We describe the metric in more detail in
Section 6.

and tables [41]. The AIDA collaboration at the University
of Nebraska-Lincoln has applied deep learning techniques to
newspaper corpora including Chronicling America and the
Burney Collection of British Newspapers [44, 45, 46] for tasks
such as poetic content recognition [47, 68], as well as visual
content recognition using dhSegment [48]. Instead of a pixel-
wise approach, we instead utilize bounding boxes, resulting
in higher performance. In addition, our pipeline recognizes
7 different classes of visual content (headlines, photographs,
illustrations, maps, comics, editorial cartoons, and advertise-
ments), extracts corresponding OCR, and generates image
embeddings. Lastly, we deploy our visual content recognition
pipeline at scale.

Article Disambiguation
Article disambiguation for historic newspaper pages has long
been of interest to researchers. Groups that have studied this
task include the IMPRESSO project [56], NewsEye project
[57], and Google Newspaper Search [24].4 Of particular
note is the approach taken by Google Newspaper Search,
which extracted headline blocks using OCR font size and
area-perimeter ratio as features and utilized the extracted head-
lines to segment each page into individual articles [24].5 We,
too, focus on headline extraction because it serves as its own
form of article disambiguation. However, unlike previous
approaches, we treat headline extraction as a visual task at
the image level, rather than a textual task at the OCR level.
Our novel approach is to leverage the visual distinctiveness
of headlines on the newspaper pages and train a classiﬁer to
predict bounding boxes around headlines on the page. The
headline text within each bounding box is then extracted from
the underlying METS/ALTO OCR.

4Related work has focused on content segmentation for books [49].
5To our knowledge, the extraction and classiﬁcation of visual content
was outside of the scope of the project.

Figure 2: A histogram showing the temporal coverage of the
16.3 million Chronicling America historic newspaper pages
included in the Newspaper Navigator dataset. A temporal
cutoff of 1922 was used for Chronicling America newspaper
digitization until 2016, explaining the corresponding dropoff
in temporal coverage.

Visual Content Extraction
Other researchers have built tools and pipelines for extract-
ing and analyzing visual content from historic documents,
including newspapers, using deep learning.3 PageNet utilizes
a Fully Convolutional Network for pixel-wise page bound-
ary extraction for historic documents [70]. dhSegment is a
deep learning framework for historical document processing,
including pixel-wise segmentation and extraction tasks [19].
Liebl and Burghardt benchmarked 11 different deep learning
backbones for the pixel-wise segmentation of historic newspa-
pers, including the separation of layout features such as text

3For approaches to historic document classiﬁcation that do not utilize
deep learning, see for example [40].

Lastly, it should be noted that proper article disambiguation
requires the ability to ﬁlter out text from advertisements due
to the ubiquity of advertisements. As with headlines, we treat
advertisement identiﬁcation as a visual task rather than a tex-
tual task because the advertisements are so naturally identiﬁed
by their visual features. Because our visual content recogni-
tion model robustly identiﬁes advertisements, we are able to
disambiguate newspaper text from advertisement text.

Image Embeddings for Cultural Heritage Collections
In recent years, researchers have utilized image embeddings
for visualizing and exploring visual content in cultural heritage
collections. The Yale Digital Humanities Lab’s PixPlot inter-
face [31] and the National Neighbors project [43] utilize Incep-
tion v3 embeddings [69]. Google Arts & Culture’s t-SNE Map
utilizes embeddings produced by the Google search pipeline
[29]. The Norwegian National Museum’s Principal Compo-
nents project [34] uses ﬁnetuned Caffe image embeddings [36].
Olivia Vane utilizes VGG-16 embeddings to visualizing the
Royal Photographic Society Collection [72]. Likewise, Brian
Foo has created a visualization of The American Museum of
Natural History’s image collection [32] using VGG-16 em-
beddings [62]. Reﬁk Anadol uses embeddings to visualize
the SALT Research collection [18]. Regarding visual con-
tent in historic newspapers in particular, Wevers and Smits
have utilized Inception v3 embeddings to perform large-scale
analysis of the CHRONIC and SIAMESET datasets derived
from historic Dutch newspapers [74]. Their work includes
the deployment of SIAMESE, a recommender system for ad-
vertisements in historic newspapers, as well as an analysis
of training a new classiﬁcation layer on top of the Inception
embeddings to predict according to custom categories [74].

Indeed, in addition to supporting visualizations of latent spaces
that capture semantic similarity, image embeddings are desir-
able for visual search and recommendation tasks due to the
ability to perform fast similarity querying with them. Us-
ing ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 [35] models pre-trained on
ImageNet, we generate image embeddings for the extracted
visual content, which are included in the Newspaper Naviga-
tor dataset in order to support a range of visual search and
recommendation tasks for the Chronicling America corpus.

CODE
All code discussed in this paper can be found in the pub-
lic GitHub repository https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/
newspaper-navigator and is open source, placed in the public
domain for unrestricted re-use. In addition, included in the
repository are the ﬁnetuned visual content recognition model,
the training set on which the model was ﬁnetuned, a Jupyter
notebook for experimenting with the visual content recogni-
tion model, and a slideshow of predictions.

launched by the Library of Congress to engage the American
public with the visual content in World War 1-era newspapers
in Chronicling America. The Beyond Words platform itself
was built using Scribe [14]. The crowdsourcing workﬂow
consisted of three different tasks that volunteers could choose
to perform:

1. Mark, in which users were asked to “draw a rectangle
around each unmarked illustration or photograph excluding
those in advertisements [and] enclose any caption or text
describing the picture and the illustrator or photographer”
[37].

2. Transcribe, in which users were asked to correct the OCR of
the caption for each marked illustration or photograph, tran-
scribe the author’s name, and note the category (“Editorial
Cartoon,” “Comics/Cartoon,” “Illustration,” “Photograph,”
or “Map”) [38].

3. Verify, in which users were asked to select the transcription
of another volunteer that most closely matches the printed
caption. Users were also able to ﬁlter out bad regions or
provide their own transcriptions in the event that neither
transcription was of good quality [39].

Up to 6 different individuals may have interacted with each
annotation during this process. The annotation required achiev-
ing at least 51% agreement with volunteers at the Transcribe
and Verify steps.

In order to ﬁnetune the visual content recognition model, it was
ﬁrst necessary to reformat the crowdsourced Beyond Words
annotations into a proper data format for training a deep learn-
ing model. We chose the Common Objects in Context (COCO)
dataset format [42], a standard data format for object detec-
tion, segmentation, and captioning tasks adopted by Facebook
AI Research’s Detectron2 deep learning platform for object
detection [76].

The veriﬁed Beyond Words annotations used as training data
were downloaded from the Beyond Words public website
on December 1, 2019. To convert the JSON ﬁle available
for download into a deep learning training set, we wrote a
Python script to pull down the Chronicling America newspaper
images utilized by Beyond Words and format the annotations
according to the COCO standard. The script is available in the
Newspaper Navigator GitHub repository.

We reiterate that the instructions for the “Mark” step asked
users to “enclose any caption or text describing the picture
and the illustrator or photographer” [37]; therefore, a model
trained on these annotations learns to include relevant text
within the bounding boxes for visual content, which can then
be extracted from the corresponding METS/ALTO OCR in an
automated fashion.

CONSTRUCTING THE TRAINING SET

Repurposing the Beyond Words Annotations
To create a training set for our visual content recognition
model, we repurposed the publicly available annotations of
photographs, illustrations, maps, comics, and editorial car-
toons derived from Beyond Words, a crowdsourcing initiative

Adding Annotations
Because headlines and advertisements were not included in the
Beyond Words workﬂow, we added annotations for headlines
and advertisements for all images in the dataset. These anno-
tations are not veriﬁed, as each page was annotated by only
one person. In addition, due to the low number of annotated

maps in the Beyond Words data (79 in total), we added anno-
tations of 122 pages containing maps, which were retrieved
by performing a keyword search of “map” on the Chronicling
America search portal restricted to the years 1914-1918. We
then downloaded the pages on which we identiﬁed maps, and
we annotated all 7 categories of visual content on each page.
Like the headline and advertisement annotations, these anno-
tations are not veriﬁed.

Training Set Statistics
The augmented Beyond Words dataset in COCO format can
be found in the Newspaper Navigator repository and is avail-
able for unrestricted re-use in the public domain. The dataset
contains 3, 559 World War 1-era Chronicling America pages
with 48, 409 annotations in total. The category breakdown of
annotations appears in Table 1.

TRAINING THE VISUAL CONTENT RECOGNITION MODEL
To train a visual content recognition model for identifying the
7 classes of different newspaper content, we chose to ﬁnetune
a pre-trained Faster-RCNN object detection model from De-
tectron2’s Model Zoo using Detectron2 [76] and PyTorch [53].
Because model inference was the bottleneck on runtime in our
pipeline, we chose the Faster-RCNN R50-FPN backbone, the
fastest such backbone according to inference time. Though
we could have utilized the highest performing Faster-RCNN
backbone, which achieved approximately 5% higher mean
average precision on the COCO [42] pre-training task at the
expense of 2.5x the inference time, qualitative evaluation of
predictions with the ﬁnetuned R50-FPN backbone indicated
that the model was performing sufﬁciently for our purposes.
Furthermore, we conjecture that the performance of our visual
content recognition model is limited by noise in the training
data, rather than model architecture and selection, for two
reasons. First, the ground-truth Beyond Words labels were
not complete because volunteers were only required to draw
one bounding box per page (though more could be added).
Second, there was non-trivial disagreement between Beyond
Words annotators for the bounding box marking task due to

the heterogeneity of visual content layouts and the resulting
ambiguities in the annotation task.6

All ﬁnetuning was performed using PyTorch [53] on a
g4dn.2xlarge Amazon EC2 instance with a single NVIDIA
T4 GPU. Finetuning the R50-FPN backbone was evaluated
on a held-out validation set according to an 80%-20% split;
the JSON ﬁles containing the training and validation splits
are available for download with the GitHub repository. We
used the following hyperparameters: a base learning rate
of 0.00025, a batch size of 8, and 64 proposals per image.
RESIZE_SHORTEST_EDGE and RANDOM_FLIP were utilized
as data augmentation techniques.7 Using early stopping, the
model was ﬁnetuned for 77 epochs, which required 17 hours
of runtime on the NVIDIA T4 GPU. The model weights ﬁle is
publicly available and can be found in the GitHub repository
for this project.

We report a mean average precision on the validation set of
63.4%; average precision for each category, as well as the
number of validation instances in each category, can be found
in Table 2. We chose average precision as our evaluation
metric because it is the standard metric utilized in the com-
puter vision community for benchmarking object detection
tasks. Given a ﬁxed intersection over union (IoU) threshold to
evaluate whether a prediction is correct, average precision is
computed by sorting all classiﬁcations according to prediction
score, generating the corresponding precision-recall curve, and
modifying it by drawing the smallest-area curve containing it
that is also monotonically decreasing. According to the COCO

6In regard to the accuracy of the annotations, it is worth noting that
Beyond Words was launched as an experiment; consequently, there
were no interventions in workﬂow or community management after
its launch, and the accuracy of the resulting annotations should be
assessed accordingly.
7These are the only two data augmentation methods currently sup-
ported by Detectron2.

standard, average precision is then computed by averaging the
precision interpolated over 101 different recall values and 10
IoU thresholds from 50% to 95%. For our calculations, we
utilized all predictions with conﬁdence scores greater than
0.05 and discarded predictions with conﬁdence scores below
this threshold.8

THE PIPELINE

Building the Manifest
In order to create a full index of digitized pages for the pipeline
to process, we used a forked version of the AIDA collabora-
tion’s chronam-get-images repository9 to generate a mani-
fest for each newspaper batch consisting of ﬁlepaths for each
page in the batch.10 Manifests consisting of 16,368,424 Chron-
icling America pages were compiled in total on March 17,
2020.

Steps of the Pipeline
In Figure 3, we present a diagram showing the pipeline work-
ﬂow. Each manifest was processed in series by our pipeline.
The pipeline code consists of six distinct steps:

8A conﬁdence score of 0.05 is the default threshold cut for retaining
predictions in Detectron2.
9https://github.com/bcglee/chronam-get-images
10More information on the batches can be found at https://
chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/batches.

1. Downloading the image and METS/ALTO XML for each
page and downsampling the image by a factor of 6 to pro-
duce a lower resolution JPEG. Downsampling was per-
formed to reduce I/O and memory consumption, as well
as to avoid the overhead introduced by the downsampling
that Detectron2 would have to perform before each forward
pass during model inference. This step was run in parallel
across all 48 CPU cores on each EC2 instance. The ﬁles
were pulled down directly from the Library of Congress’s
public AWS S3 buckets.

2. Running the visual content recognition model inference on
each image to produce bounding box predictions complete
with coordinates, predicted classes, and conﬁdence scores.
This step was run in parallel across all 4 GPUs on each
EC2 instance. Predictions with conﬁdence scores greater
than 0.05 were saved. We chose to save predictions with
low conﬁdence scores in order to allow a user to select a
threshold cut based on the user’s ideal tradeoff between
precision and recall.

3. Extracting the OCR within each predicting bounding box.
This step required parsing the METS/ALTO XML and was
run in parallel across all 48 CPU cores on each EC2 in-
stance.

4. Cropping and saving the extracted visual content as down-
sampled JPEGs (for all classes other than headlines). This
step was run in parallel across all 48 CPU cores on each
EC2 instance.

5. Generating ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 embeddings for the
cropped and saved images with conﬁdence scores of greater

than or equal to 0.5. This step was implemented using
a forked version of img2vec11 [59]. This step was run
in parallel across all 4 GPUs on each EC2 instance. The
ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 embeddings were extracted from
the penultimate layer of each respective architecture after
being trained on ImageNet (the models themselves were
downloaded from torchvision.models in PyTorch [53]).
The 2,048-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were se-
lected due to ResNet-50’s high performance and fast infer-
ence time relative to other image recognition models [21].
The 512-dimensional ResNet-18 embeddings were also gen-
erated due to their lower dimensionality, enabling faster
computation for search and recommendation tasks.

6. Saving the extracted metadata and cropped images. The
format of the saved metadata is described in the next section.

Running the Pipeline at Scale
All pipeline processing was performed on 2 g4dn.12xlarge
Amazon AWS EC2 instances, each with 48 Intel Cascade
Lake vCPUs and 4 NVIDIA T4 GPUs. All pipeline code
was written in Python 3. In total, the pipeline successfully
processed 16,368,041 pages (99.998%) in 19 days of wall-
clock time. The manifests of pages that were successfully
processed, as well as the 383 pages that failed, can be found
in the Newspaper Navigator GitHub Repository.

Statistics & Visualizations
A statistical breakdown of extracted content in the Newspaper
Navigator dataset is presented in Table 3. Because the choice
of threshold cut on conﬁdence score affects the number of
resulting visual content in the Newspaper Navigator dataset,
we include statistics for three different threshold cuts of 0.5,
0.7, and 0.9.

11https://github.com/bcglee/img2vec

In Figure 4, we show visualizations of the number of pho-
tographs, illustrations, maps, comics, editorial cartoons, head-
lines, and advertisements in the Newspaper Navigator dataset
according to year of publication. These visualizations show
the average number of appearances per page of each of the
seven classes over time, as well as the average fraction of the
page covered by each of the seven classes over time. As in Ta-
ble 3, we show three different cuts. With these visualizations,
we can observe trends such as the rise of photographs at the
turn of the 20th century and the gradual increase in the amount
of page space covered by headlines from 1880 to 1920.

To demonstrate questions that we can begin to answer with
the Newspaper Navigator dataset, we have included Figure 5,
a visualization showing maps of the Civil War identiﬁed by
searching the visual content for all 278,094 pages published
between 1861 and 1865 in the dataset.12 From this collection
alone, researchers can study Civil War battles, the history of
cartography, differences in print trends for northern and south-
ern newspapers, and map reproduction patterns (“virality”).

Dataset Access and Format
The Newspaper Navigator dataset can be accessed via the
Newspaper Navigator GitHub repository. We introduce the
data format below, but more detailed instructions for use can be
found at the webpage. For each processed page, an associated
JSON ﬁle contains the following metadata:

• filepath [str]: the path to the image, relative to the

Chronicling America ﬁle structure.13

• pub_date [str]: the publication date of the page, in the

format YYYY−MM−DD.

• boxes [list:list]: a list containing the normalized co-
ordinates of predicted boxes, indexed according to [x1, y1,
x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the top-left corner of the box rela-
tive to the standard image origin, and (x2, y2) is the bottom-
right corner .

• scores [list:float]: a list containing the conﬁdence
score associated with each box (only predicted boxes with
a conﬁdence score ≥ 0.5 were retained).

• pred_classes [list:int]: a list containing the pre-
dicted class for each box using the following mapping of
integers to classes:

– 0 → Photograph
– 1 → Illustration
– 2 → Map
– 3 → Comics/Cartoon
– 4 → Editorial Cartoon
– 5 → Headline
– 6 → Advertisement

• ocr [list:str]: a list containing the OCR of white

space-separated strings identiﬁed within each box.

(a) A plot showing the average number of appearances per page of each of the
seven classes of visual content, from 1850 to 1950.

(b) A plot showing the average fraction of each page covered by each of the seven
classes of visual content, from 1850 to 1950.

Figure 4: Multipanel plots visualizing the number of photographs, illustrations, maps, comics, editorial cartoons, headlines,
and advertisements in the Newspaper Navigator dataset, derived from 16.3 million historic newspaper pages in Chronicling
America. In each plot, the middle line corresponds to a cut of 0.7 on conﬁdence score, and the upper and lower bounds
of the conﬁdence interval in light blue correspond to cuts of 0.5 and 0.9, respectively. Note that the y-axis scales vary per
category in both plots. The fraction of each page covered is included because it is a more consistent metric for complicated visual
content layouts (such as photo montages and classiﬁed ads): predicted bounding boxes can vary greatly in number while still
remaining correct and covering the same regions in aggregate.

• visual_content_filepaths [list:str]: a list con-
taining the ﬁlepath for each cropped image (except head-
lines, which were not cropped and saved).

Another JSON ﬁle with the same ﬁle name with the sufﬁx
“_embeddings” includes the image embeddings in the follow-
ing format; any prediction with a conﬁdence score of less than
0.5 does not have a corresponding embedding:

• filepath [str]

• resnet_50_embeddings [list:list]: a list contain-
ing the 2,048-dimensional ResNet-50 embedding for each
image (except headlines, for which embeddings were not
generated).

• resnet_18_embeddings [list:list]: a list contain-
ing the 512-dimensional ResNet-18 embedding for each
image (except headlines, for which embeddings were not
generated).

• visual_content_filepaths [list:list]

Pre-packaged Datasets
In order to make the Newspaper Navigator dataset accessi-
ble to those without coding experience, we have also pack-
aged smaller datasets derived from the Newspaper Navigator
dataset that can be downloaded in bulk from our GitHub repos-
itory. These derivative datasets are grouped geographically
and temporally and cover both visual content and textual con-
tent (machine-readable headlines, captions of visual content,

etc.). One such example is the collection of Civil War maps
shown in Figure 5. We will continue to add derivative datasets
as Newspaper Navigator evolves.

DISCUSSION

Generalization to 19th Century Newspaper Pages
Given that the visual content recognition model has been
trained on World War 1-era newspapers, it is natural to ques-
tion the generalization ability of the model to 19th century
newspapers. Though Figure 4 reveals trends consistent with
intuition, such as the emergence of photographs in historic
newspapers at the turn of the 20th century, it is still worthwhile
to quantify generalization. To do so, we randomly selected
500 newspaper pages from 1850 to 1875 and 500 newspaper
pages from 1875 to 1900 and annotated these pages. In Table
4, we present the average precision for headlines, advertise-
ments, and illustrations in the test sets using our annotations
as the ground truth (other classes were omitted due to their
rarity in the annotated pages). Comparing the results in Ta-
ble 4 to the results on the validation data in 2, we observe a
moderate dropoff in performance for pages published between
1875 and 1900, as well as a more major dropoff in perfor-
mance for pages published between 1850 and 1875. However,
the extracted visual content from the pre-1875 pages in the
Newspaper Navigator dataset is still of sufﬁcient quality to
enable novel analysis, as evidenced by the extracted collection
of Civil War maps shown in Figure 5.

Partnering with Volunteer Crowdsourcing Initiatives
Our work is also a case study in partnering machine learning
projects with volunteer crowdsourcing initiatives, a promis-
ing paradigm in which annotators are volunteers who learn
about a new topic by participating. With the growing efforts
of cultural heritage crowsdsourcing initiatives such as the
Library of Congress’s By the People [1], Smithsonian’s Dig-
ital Volunteers [15], the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum’s History Unfolded [9], Zooniverse [63], the New
York Public Library’s Emigrant City [4], The British Library’s
LibCrowds [10], The Living with Machines project [11], and
Trove’s newspaper crowdsourcing initiative [20], there are
more opportunities than ever to utilize crowdsourced data

for machine learning tasks relevant to cultural heritage, from
handwriting recognition to botany taxonomic classiﬁcation
[60]. These partnerships also have the potential to provide
insight into project design, decisions, workﬂows, and the con-
text of the materials for which crowdsourcing contributions
are sought. Along with Dielemann et al.’s work [30] train-
ing a neural network to classify galaxies using crowdsourced
data from GalaxyZoo, we hope that our project encourages
more machine learning researchers to partner with volunteer
crowdsourcing projects, especially to study topics pertinent to
cultural heritage.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have described our pipeline for extracting, cat-
egorizing, and captioning visual content, including headlines,
photographs, illustrations, maps, comics, editorial cartoons,
and advertisements in historic newspapers. We present the
Newspaper Navigator dataset, a dataset of these 7 types of
extracted visual content from 16.3 million pages from Chron-
icling America. This is the largest dataset of its kind ever
produced. In addition to releasing the Newspaper Navigator
dataset, we have released our visual content recognition model
for historic newspapers, as well as a new training dataset for
this task based on annotations from Beyond Words, the Library
of Congress Labs’s crowdsourcing initiative for annotating and
captioning visual content in World War 1-era newspapers in
Chronicling America. All code has been placed in the public
domain for unrestricted re-use.

FUTURE WORK
Future work on the pipeline itself includes improving the
visual content recognition model’s generalization ability for
pre-20th century newspaper pages, especially for the 10.4% of
the pages in the Newspaper Navigator dataset published before
1875. This could be accomplished by ﬁnetuning on a more
diverse training set, which could be constructed by partnering
with another volunteer crowdsourcing initiative such as the
Living with Machines project [11]. One could also imagine
training an ensemble of visual content recognition models on
different date ranges. Given that only 10.4% of pages in the
Newspaper Navigator dataset were published before 1875, it is
straightforward to re-run the pipeline with an improved visual
content recognition model on these pages.14

To improve the textual content extracted from the OCR, future
work includes training an NLP pipeline to correct systematic
OCR errors. In the second step of the Beyond Words pipeline,
volunteers were asked to correct or enter the OCR that appears
over each marked bounding box, resulting in approximately
10,000 corrected textual annotations to date. It is straightfor-
ward to construct training pairs of input and output in order to
train a supervised model to correct OCR. Other approaches to
OCR postprocessing include utilizing existing post-hoc OCR
correction pipelines [17, 50, 51, 71], all of which could be
benchmarked on the aforementioned Beyond Words training
pairs.

14This simply requires replacing the model weights ﬁle and ﬁltering
the pages for processing by date range.

Figure 5: A visualization of the Civil War maps in the Newspaper Navigator dataset, ﬁltered from 278,094 pages published from
1861 through 1865. Note that certain maps appear multiple times, indicating that they were reprinted. Only a small fraction of
included images are false positives, suggesting the high performance of the visual content recognition model in the pipeline. This
collection of Civil War maps is available as a pre-packaged dataset.

The future work that excites us most, however, consists of the
many ways that the Newspaper Navigator dataset can be used.
Our immediate future work consists of building a new search
user interface called Newspaper Navigator that will be user
tested in order to evaluate new methods of exploratory search.
However, future work also includes investigating a range of
digital humanities questions. For example, the Viral Texts [25,
28, 65, 64, 66, 77] and Oceanic Exchanges [27] projects have
studied text reproduction patterns in 19th century newspapers,
including newspapers in Chronicling America; the Newspaper
Navigator dataset allows us to study photograph reproduction
in 20th century newspapers. In addition, using the headlines
in Newspaper Navigator, we can study which news cycles
appeared in different regions of the United States at different
times. These examples are just a few of many that we hope
will be examined with the Newspaper Navigator dataset. We
hope to inspire a wide range of digital humanities, public
humanities, and creative computing projects.
