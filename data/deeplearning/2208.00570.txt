ABSTRACT

Understanding the faint end of quasar luminosity function at a high redshift is important since the
number density of faint quasars is a critical element in constraining ultraviolet (UV) photon budgets for
ionizing the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the early universe. Here, we present quasar LF reaching
M1450 ∼ −22.0 AB mag at z ∼ 5, about one magnitude deeper than previous UV LFs. We select
quasars at z ∼ 5 with a deep learning technique from deep data taken by the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), covering a 15.5 deg2 area. Beyond the traditional color selection
method, we improved the quasar selection by training an artiﬁcial neural network for distinguishing
z ∼ 5 quasars from non-quasar sources based on their colors and adopting the Bayesian information
criterion that can further remove high-redshift galaxies from the quasar sample. When applied to a
small sample of spectroscopically identiﬁed quasars and galaxies, our method is successful in selecting
quasars at ∼ 83% eﬃciency (5/6) while minimizing the contamination rate of high-redshift galaxies
(1/8) by up to three times compared to the selection using color selection alone (3/8). The number of
our ﬁnal quasar candidates with M1450 < −22.0 mag is 35. Our quasar UV LF down to M1450 = −22
mag or even fainter (M1450 = −21 mag) suggests a rather low number density of faint quasars and the
faint-end slope of −1.6+0.21
−0.19, favoring a scenario where quasars play a minor role in ionizing the IGM
at high redshift.

1. INTRODUCTION

Quasars are the most luminous sub-population of ac-
tive galactic nuclei (AGNs) powered by the accretion of
surrounding mediums to the supermassive black hole lo-
cated at the center of its host galaxy. Although quasars
contribute to maintaining the ionized state of IGM along
with star-forming galaxies in the post-reionization era
(z < 6), the role of the quasar in explaining the ioniz-
ing background of the universe is not fully understood
(Fan et al. 2006; Glikman et al. 2011; Ikeda et al. 2011;
Giallongo et al. 2015; Parsa et al. 2018; Boutsia et al.
2018).

To evaluate the contribution of quasars to the IGM
ionizing photon budget, many studies searched for high-
redshift quasars (Glikman et al. 2011; Akiyama et al.
2018; Matsuoka et al. 2016; McGreer et al. 2018; Parsa
et al. 2018; Giallongo et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2015, 2019,
2020; Wang et al. 2019; Grazian et al. 2020; Shin et al.
2020), especially at the absolute magnitude at 1450 ˚A
in the rest frame (M1450) ∼ −23.5 mag where the ioniz-
ing emissivity of the quasar is considerable, as shown in
Kim et al. (2020; hereafter K20). While the quasar UV
LFs from diﬀerent studies are now converging toward a
common shape at M (cid:46) −23.5 mag that can be approx-
imated with a pure number density evolution at z > 2
(Kim & Im 2021), there remains great uncertainty in
the LF at a fainter magnitude. If the number density of

quasars is as high as some studies suggest at the faintest
end (Boutsia et al. 2018; Giallongo et al. 2019; Grazian
et al. 2020), quasars are still a viable candidate to be
responsible for cosmic re-ionization at high redshift.

To extend the faint limit of the quasar LF, we can
adopt two approaches: one to use deeper data, and an-
other to select quasars using a new technique. As for
the deeper data, the second public data release (PDR2;
Aihara et al. 2019) of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Sub-
aru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP; Aihara et al. 2018)
provides an interesting opportunity. The deeper layers
of the survey go down to i ∼ 27.0 mag (Aihara et al.
2019) and yet an area wide enough (tens of deg2) to
negate the cosmic variance in number density. There-
fore, such a dataset is suitable for ﬁnding quasars with
M1450 ∼ −22.0 mag and probing the quasar LF ∼ 1.0
mag deeper than previously constructed quasar LFs at
z ∼ 5 (McGreer et al. 2018; Shin et al. 2020; Niida et al.
2020, hereafter, N20).

Another diﬃculty in extending the quasar LF to a
fainter limit is that galaxies occupy a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the high-redshift UV sources at M1450 > −23
mag (Ono et al. 2018; Adams et al. 2020; N20; Bowler
et al. 2021; Kim & Im 2021) and can contaminate quasar
samples made from a conventional color-selection tech-
nique. Also, as we explore the fainter limit, the num-
ber of sources becomes formidably large. This makes it
challenging to apply time-consuming selection methods
such as spectral energy distribution (SED) ﬁtting for the
quasar selection (Reed et al. 2017), although such meth-
ods may be eﬃcient in discerning quasars from galaxies.
Therefore, we adopt a new and powerful approach that
combines deep learning (DL) and Bayesian information
criterion (BIC). Machine learning algorithms are popu-
lar to classify quasars from the other objects these days
(Richards et al. 2004; Jin et al. 2019; Nakoneczny et al.
2019; Schindler et al. 2019), with multiple strong points.
(1) Machine learning can quickly judge each astronom-
ical object (Gupta et al. 2014). (2) unlike linear color-
cuts deﬁned arbitrarily by the human inspection of the
color space, it can optimize a nonlinear boundary mathe-
matically by minimizing the diﬀerence between the true
label and the predicted label from the trained model
(Kojima et al. 2020). (3) It can consider the estimates
from all the bands as its input to decide the boundary
between quasars and other astronomical objects, while
the traditional color selection can utilize a few broad-
bands only. Thus, DL can perform a fast selection of
quasar candidates with maximal completeness. The BIC
selection is additionally implemented to reﬁne the se-
lected candidates and can remove contaminating sources
eﬃciently (e.g., Shin et al. 2020).

This paper is structured as follows. We described the
HSC-SSP data in Section 2, and training data for DL
and quasar/star model for BIC in Section 3. Section 4
describes the DL and BIC selection of quasars and the
selected candidates.
In Section 5, we show how the
quasar binned LFs and parametric LF are derived based
on the ﬁnal candidates. In Section 6, we discuss how our
quasar selection and the quasar LF compare with pre-
vious studies and how the improvement over previous
works was possible. Section 7 summarizes the ﬁndings
and the results of this study. Throughout this paper, the
AB magnitude system is adopted for all ﬁlters (Oke &
Gunn 1983), after the Galactic extinction correction by
adopting the dust map of the Schlegel et al. (1998). We
assume ΩM = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7 and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1
of the ΛCDM cosmology, which has been supported by
observations in the past decades (e.g., Im et al. 1997)

2. HSC-SSP DEEP-LAYER CATALOG

We used the catalog constructed from the Deep layer
of the HSC-SSP in PDR2 with a survey area of 27 deg2
and a 5-σ image depth of ∼ 27 mag for a point source
in r-band (Aihara et al. 2019). The Deep layer consists
of four ﬁelds (Aihara et al. 2018): the XMM Large-
Scale Structure Survey (XMM-LSS, Pierre et al. 2004),
Extended-COSMOS (E-COSMOS, Scoville et al. 2007),
the European Large-Area ISO Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-
N1, Rowan-Robinson et al. 2004), and the DEEP2-
3 (Cooper et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2013). We
used the data taken in ﬁve broadbands (g, r, i, z, y) and
two narrow-bands (N B816, N B921). The 5-σ image
depths of the seven bands (g, r, i, z, y, N B816, N B921)
are (27.3, 26.9, 26.7, 26.3, 25.3, 26.1, 25.9) mags for a
point source detection, respectively (Aihara et al. 2019).
An eﬀective survey area of this layer in PDR2 is about
15.5 deg2, calculated from a random source catalog pro-
vided in the HSC data archive system (Coupon et al.
2018).

We used the source catalog from the HSC-SSP PDR2
excluding objects whose photometry measurements are
ﬂagged to be aﬀected by the cosmic ray, saturation, ab-
normal local background estimation, bad pixels, shal-
low depth, and the proximity to the survey edges. Also,
we considered the objects that are primary and unique
sources having no child in the survey. Table 1 lists the
ﬂags that we adopted to retrieve the catalog sources.
The number of retrieved sources is about 3.5 million. For
our analysis, we used the point-spread function (PSF)
magnitudes (see Section 4.1).

3.1. Training & Test Data

To select reliable high-redshift quasar candidates us-
ing the DL technique, we should prepare a dataset in-
cluding training data representing quasars at z ∼ 5
(‘qso’) and the other objects (‘nqso’), and data for test-
ing the trained model. The ‘nqso’ class includes HSC-
SSP sources satisfying our point source selection cri-
terion. Although ‘nqso’ class might contain few real
quasar samples, the probability of including real quasars
is too low (∼ 0.2%, please refer to Section 4.1). This
kind of empirical approach to constructing the ‘nqso’
sample has been used in previous works (e.g., Timlin
et al. 2018) when the properties of the ‘nqso’ popula-
tion are poorly known. The ‘qso’ dataset is made up
of quasar SED models (described in Section 3.2.1) be-
cause of a small number of spectroscopically conﬁrmed

quasars at z ∼ 5 compared to the other classes. The
training dataset for each class is a randomly sampled
subset, as described in Section 4.2.4.

We ﬁnd six spectroscopically identiﬁed quasars and
three promising quasar candidates at 4.5 < z < 5.5 in
the Deep layer (McGreer et al. 2013; Pˆaris et al. 2018;
Shin et al. 2020) with a matching radius of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0. The
matched quasars are used for testing the performance of
the trained model independently.

3.2. Quasar/Star SED model

3.2.1. Quasar

We created model spectra of quasars at z ∼ 5 by cre-
ating a composite SED of Lusso et al. (2015) and Selsing
et al. (2016) at the bluewards and redwards of 1450 ˚A,
respectively. Compared to the composite quasar spec-
trum of Vanden Berk et al. (2001), their SEDs are more
likely to be intrinsic ones, free from UV absorption and
host galaxy contamination.

Then, we manipulated the equivalent width (EW) of
Lyα and N V λ1240 and the continuum slope (αλ)
of the model following their empirical distributions of
high-redshift quasars; a log-normal distribution with
log EW = 1.524 ± 0.391 (Ba˜nados et al. 2016) and
αλ = −1.6 ± 1.0 (Mazzucchelli et al. 2017). Concern-
ing the IGM absorption at high redshifts, we used an
updated version of the IGM attenuation model (Inoue
et al. 2014). Finally, we rescaled the EW of the CIV
emission line by multiplying the rate of the EW change
of Lyα and N V λ1240. The Baldwin eﬀect was not

considered in this study (Baldwin 1977), not to bias our
sample to be those that follow the Baldwin eﬀect.

The quasar SED model has four parameters: the red-
shift (z), EW, αλ, and M1450. The redshift range of the
model is 4.0 to 6.0 in steps of ∆z = 0.01, and the αλ
range is -3.6 to 1.6 in steps of ∆αλ = 0.2. The log EW
(˚A) grid consists of twenty evenly-spaced values from
0.76 to 2.324, and the M1450 range is −28 < M1450 <
−20 in steps of ∆M1450 = 0.1 mag. The EW and αλ
ranges of the constructed quasar models enable us to
account for 95.4 percent of the entire quasar popula-
tion, respectively, assuming that quasars follow the αλ
and EW distributions. As a result, there are 12 million
model spectra in total.

3.2.2. Star

We adopted the stellar model spectra generated by the
BT-Settl models that use the ‘BT2’ water vapor line list
computed in Barber et al. (2006) and the ‘Settl’ model
accounting for dust formation and its gravitational set-
tling (Allard et al. 2003) based on solar abundances of
Asplund et al. (2009). We used a total of 14,342 spec-
tra covering the parameter space of Teﬀ of 400–70,000 K
with 50–100 K step sizes, log(g) of -0.5–6.0 with a 0.5
step size, [M/H] of -4–0.5 with step sizes of 0.2 ∼ 0.5,
and [α/M] of 0.0–0.6 with a 0.2 step size. Note that
[α/M] varies only for the model with Teﬀ > 2600K, and
we added a normalization factor (fN ) as a free parame-
ter.

4. QUASAR SELECTION

We used multiple methods sequentially to select
quasar candidates at z ∼ 5: pre-selection, DL, BIC, and
visual inspection. The pre-selection picks out the candi-
dates satisfying our survey design and the minimal con-
ditions required to be a quasar, signiﬁcantly curtailing
the number of the candidates. DL plays the role of judg-
ing an object’s class using the colors of the pre-selected
candidates. Similar to DL, BIC indicates a likelihood
of an object being a star or a quasar based on the re-
sults from the SED ﬁtting. For candidates passing this
BIC selection, we check the quality of images used for
measuring their ﬂuxes.

4.1. Pre-selection

We ﬁrst selected candidates in the following order. (1)
magnitude and error cuts were set to 19 < i < 25 mag
and σi < 0.2 mag, respectively; (2) we carried out a
point source selection using the i-band parameter; and
(3) we set a g − r color cut to select red objects that are
consistent with being at z > 4.5.

First, we limited the i-band magnitude range from 19
to 25 mags, avoiding saturation and allowing to search
quasars fainter as much as M1450 ∼ −21.0 mag. Since
quasars at z ∼ 5 are red objects with large r − i (cid:38) 1.2,
the magnitude limit also enabled us to obtain r-band
photometry above its detection limit of r ∼ 27 mag.
In addition, we set the error cut of σi < 0.2 to select
sources with reliable i-band detection, eliminating few
more objects (< 0.01%) that happen to be in a shallow
regions of the HSC-SSP images.

Next, we distinguished point sources from extended
sources. We included this process since a quasar whose
light is dominated by an AGN at its center would ap-
pear as a point source. An obvious disadvantage of this
selection is that we miss AGNs where host galaxies are
more dominant, especially for AGNs with MUV (cid:38) −23
mag (Trebitsch et al. 2020; Bowler et al. 2021; Kim &
Im 2021). Therefore, our survey is limited to the AGNs
that have strong emission lines and outshine their host
galaxies in UV.

The point source selection can be done by comparing
PSF magnitudes and CModel magnitudes. We called
the diﬀerence between the i-band PSF and CModel mag-
nitudes (i − iCModel) the extendedness parameter and
adopted it to classify point sources. While the extend-
edness parameter value is close to 0 for point sources,
the parameter value deviates signiﬁcantly from 0 for ex-
tended sources due to a mismatch in the object extend-
edness and the point source modeling. The extendedness
parameter has been frequently adopted to address an ex-
tendedness of an object (e.g., Matsuoka et al. 2018).

To the extendedness value for the point source selec-
tion, we used the I-band catalog of the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS,
Leauthaud et al. 2007). Leauthaud et al. (2007) classi-
ﬁed point sources in the surface brightness (MU MAX)
versus apparent magnitude (MAG AUTO) plane, with
a cut of MU MAX < 21.5. Their point source classiﬁca-
tion was nearly complete at I < 25 mag. Therefore, we
matched the HST point/extended sources from Leau-
thaud et al. (2007) to the HSC i-band sources at i < 25
mag since our purpose is to search quasars as faint as
i ∼ 25 mag.

Figure 1a displays the histograms of point and ex-
tended sources as a function of (i − iCModel).
In Fig-
ure 1b, we show the dependency of the extendedness
value of the HST point and extended sources on the i-
band magnitude. The error bars correspond to the 16th
and 84th percentiles of the distributions, respectively.
As the i-band magnitude becomes fainter, they over-
lap more. Figure 1c shows the point-source complete-
ness and contamination rate of the HST point/extended

sources with (i − iCModel) < 0.2 as a function of i-band
magnitude. The point-source completeness is ∼ 90%
at i = 25 mag, and 98.4 % at i < 25 mag, while the
contamination rate reaches about 40% at i ∼ 25 mag.

Even though the point source selection cut caused a
high contamination rate of an extended source mimick-
ing a point source, we focused on increasing the point
source completeness. The following selections using SED
shape can further weed out high-redshift objects that are
dominated by galaxy light.

In the third step, we eliminated the sources with the
possible detections at the blueward wavelengths, which
are clearly not high-redshift quasars with the IGM at-
tenuation. We selected the sources that are not detected
in g-band imposing SNR < 3, or had g − r > 0.987,
which is determined from the minimum g − r color of
our quasar model at z = 4.5 (Section 3.2.1). After these
steps, the number of pre-selected objects is 125,644 over
15.5 deg2.

4.2. Deep Learning

4.2.1. A brief introduction

The ﬁrst mathematical expression about a neural net-
work was introduced by McCulloch & Pitts (1943). The
successful performance of a convolutional neural net-
work in the ImageNet project proved the potential of
the neural network (Deng et al. 2009), and it spurred
the application of DL to many other disciplines includ-
ing astronomy.

A neural network consists of multiple layers: an input
layer, an output layer, and hidden layers. The input
layer receives an object’s information, and the output
layer returns the object’s property we want to know.
The hidden layers connect the information in the input
layer to the output object’s property. In this work, we
implemented a supervised DL to predict a class for an
object (output) based on its photometry (input).

Each layer has neurons which are the smallest data-
processing units. Each neuron in each layer except for
the input layer has a weight, w, corresponding to each
feature of an input, x, and a bias, b. The neuron cal-
culates the weighted sum of the features, adds the bias
to the sum, and passes the sum to an activation func-
tion, A. The activation functions rescale the sum and
determine whether the output value, y, for each neuron
should be activated or not (y = 0). The following equa-
tion shows how to calculate the output value for an i-th
neuron in an l-th layer.

yl
i = A (

(1)

where nl−1 is the number of neurons in the (l − 1)th
layer. The output of the i-th neuron in the l-th layer
(yl
i) becomes the input to the neurons in the next layer.
If the next layer is an output layer, then the output be-
comes the probabilities. Weights and a bias for each
neuron contribute to predicting the ﬁnal outputs. Thus,
the main purpose of the model training is to ﬁnd appro-
priate weights and a bias for each neuron. The optimal
model parameters (w and b) can be obtained by mini-
mizing the loss function, which considers the diﬀerence
between the true class and the predicted class by the
model.

4.2.2. Hyperparameter optimization

Before optimizing the weights and bias of each neuron,
we examined the best combination of the hyperparam-
eters. The hyperparameters are the parameters aﬀect-
ing the entire training process. It includes parameters
related to the architecture of the neural network (the
number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in
each hidden layer), and rules for model training (A, loss
function, weight decay, optimizer, batch size, epochs,
initial values for w). The hyperparameter combination
can inﬂuence the converge time for ﬁnding the optimal
model parameters and the model performance. For eﬃ-
cient model training, we have to ﬁnd the best conﬁgura-
tion of the hyperparameters. The hyperparameters are
explained in detail:

• The number of hidden layers

• The number of neurons in each hidden layer

• Activation function: Each neuron has an activa-
tion function to decide whether the inputs con-
tribute to minimizing the loss function or not. The
activation function also enables us to calculate the
gradient of the loss function with respect to the
weights and the bias of each neuron according to
the Backpropagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al.
1986). Among various activation functions, we
adopted the Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU, Nair &
Hinton 2010), given as f (x) == max{0, x}.

• Loss function: The diﬀerence between the true and
the predicted properties for a given model. We
used the cross-entropy loss, which has been widely
used due to the discrete property of the output,
to calculate a mean loss of the training data in a
batch.

• Weight decay: The penalty for the large weights.
The weight decay term was additionally applied to
the loss function to avoid overﬁtting.

• Optimizer: An optimization algorithm to mini-
mize the loss function. We used stochastic gra-
dient descent (SGD). The SGD calculates partial
derivatives of the loss function of given weights or
biases and updates the two parameters iteratively
toward ﬁnding a global minimum. The SGD uses
the randomly selected subsets of the training data
(i.e., batch sample) at each iteration.

– Learning rate: The step size of model param-
eters to explore the partial derivatives of the
loss function

– Momentum: The fraction of taking into ac-
count the previous update to calculate the
current update for a parameter. Adopting
the momentum, we can accelerate conver-
gence to the minimum by giving more weights
to previous directions compared to the cur-
rent direction which may be biased toward a
noise.

• Batch size: The number of training subsets used

to calculate a gradient descent

• Epochs: The number of passing all training data

to train the model

• Initial values for w: To implement the Backprop-
agation algorithm and update w and b, we should
assign initial values for w. In this paper, we ran-
domly selected the initial values from a normal
distribution in which the mean and standard de-
viation are 0 and 1.

We constructed a feed-forward four-layer neural net-
work. To prevent the risk of over-ﬁtting, we set 20
epochs as an upper limit of the time for evaluating the
derivatives and updating the model parameters. Except
for the ﬁxed hyperparameters (e.g., the number of hid-
den layers, activation function, loss function), we deter-
mined an optimal hyperparameter combination among

the hyperparameter search spaces speciﬁed in Table 2.
For this, we used the Bayesian model-based optimiza-
tion algorithm of the RayTune Python package (Bergstra
et al. 2013; Liaw et al. 2018), and tried 100 hyperparam-
eter conﬁgurations. The hyperparameter set with the
lowest loss was chosen as the ﬁnal hyperparameter set
for testing pre-selected sources in Section 4.1.

4.2.3. Preprocessing the inputs

As the inputs of the training process, we used six col-
ors from the catalog: g − r, r − i, i − N B816, N B816 −
z, z − N B921, N B921 − y. When an i-band-selected
source is not detected or fainter than the imaging depth
of the other bands, we adopted 5-σ imaging depths as
their magnitudes in the corresponding bands. Consid-
ering the discriminative feature in g-band owing to the
IGM absorption, we assigned g = 30 mag when the ob-
ject is not detected or has a magnitude fainter than 30
mag in g-band.

After reﬁning the magnitudes, we calculated the colors
of the dataset, standardized each color, and extracted
six principal components using the scikit-learn
Python package (Pedregosa et al. 2011). The standard-
ization removes the mean of each color and scales its
standard deviation, enabling the principal component
analysis (PCA) to weigh each color equally. Note that
we used all the six principal components derived from
the PCA, although the PCA is frequently used for di-
mension reduction of input features.

4.2.4. Training

Our training set contains two classes of objects – the
‘nqso’ class and the ‘qso’ class. The ‘nqso’ class de-
notes objects that are not quasars and the nqso class
set consists of about 3.34 × 105 i-band-selected point
sources in the Deep layer of HSC-SSP. The ‘qso’ class
denotes quasars, and the qso class set consists of millions
of quasar model SEDs at z = 4.5 − 5.5 (Section 3.2.1).
The class imbalance problem is handled by randomly
sampling the nqso and the qso classes when making a

vii

because the absolute number of nqso objects is larger
than that of qso objects in a real world (∼ 10, 000 : 1).
To remove misclassiﬁed nqso objects from quasar candi-
dates, we performed the SED ﬁtting and an additional
BIC selection, as in Shin et al. (2020). We brieﬂy sum-
marize the procedure as follows.

First, we ﬁtted the SED of the DL-selected quasar
candidates with both quasar and star models. To allow
margins for errors, we chose a redshift range spanning
4.0 to 6.0 for the quasar model ﬁt, a bit broader than
the redshift range of the model used for DL. Throughout
the SED-ﬁtting process, we adopted the chi-square cal-
culation presented in Sawicki (2012), which deals with
the upper limits of observation data. The ﬁtting results
provided the chi-square values and the best-ﬁt param-
eters of the quasar and star models. We excluded the
candidates with the best-ﬁt quasar model of χ2
qso > 30.
Then, we calculated BIC, a criterion used for model
selection considering a likelihood and the number of free
parameters in a model, k.
In general, a ﬁtting result
becomes better as k increases. Giving a penalty to a
model with many parameters, the diﬀerence between the
BIC values of diﬀerent models (∆BIC) can determine a
preferred model. It is deﬁned as

∆BIC = (χ2

star − χ2

qso) + (kstar − kqso) × ln n,

(2)

where n is the number of data points of an object, and
χ2 is the chi-square value of a best-ﬁt model. The ‘star’
and ‘qso’ subscripts mean the best-ﬁt model for star and
quasar. If ∆BIC of a DL-selected candidate is greater
than 10, we regarded the candidate as the BIC-selected
candidate (Liddle 2007).

After the BIC selection, the number of quasar can-
didates becomes 78. Note that one of three promising
candidates reported in Shin et al. (2020) and a known
quasar at z = 4.564 were excluded in this process. We
discuss this issue in 6.2.

4.4. Visual inspection

We visually inspected images of the 78 candidates and
excluded 25 of them due to spurious photometry results
caused by bright neighbors, background variations, op-
tical ghosts, satellite tracks, or scattered lights. These
features caused the local background overestimates, re-
sulting in ﬂux underestimates in g-band that mimicked
the redshifted Lyman break.

Then, we examined if the remaining 53 candidates
were previously reported by querying NASA/IPAC Ex-
tragalactic Database (NED) using the astroquery. We
recovered 5/6 conﬁrmed quasars (McGreer et al. 2013;
Shin et al. 2020) and two promising candidates in Shin

total sample (Buda et al. 2017).
In reality, the nqso
contains real quasars in the survey area. However, given
that the number of real quasars is expected to be small
(a few tens), their contamination of the nqso sample is
negligible. The number of sources in each class was ﬁxed
to 100,000, resulting in a total dataset size of 200,000.

We set aside 20 % of the dataset as the test dataset.
The remainder was split into ﬁve subsets – four for the
training dataset and one for the validation set. To min-
imize possible dependence on a given training dataset,
we performed a 5-fold cross-validation by changing the
subset used for the validation set. If DL classiﬁed an ob-
ject as qso more than or equal to 3 times, we considered
the object as a quasar candidate of the trained model.
Also, to make our selection more robust, we trained
additional 99 neural network models by following the
above procedure ( ˇDurovˇc´ıkov´a et al. 2020). From the
100 results of the 100 models, we classiﬁed an object as
qso if the DL-selected candidates show qso label more
than or equal to 80 times. Figure 2 shows the confusion
matrix for our DL selection. The probability of an actual
nqso object to be predicted as qso class (False Positive
Rate, FPR) is extremely low (∼ 0.5%). The probability
is also as low as ∼ 0.3% for the trained model classifying
an actual qso object as nqso class (False Negative Rate,
FNR). The low FNR can assure us high completeness of
the quasar survey. In Section 6.4, we compare previous
quasar selections and the DL selection. The number of
quasar candidates from the ensemble learning is 1,599.

4.3. SED ﬁtting for BIC selection

Although FPR is very low, misclassiﬁed nqso objects
could occupy a large portion of the quasar candidates

M1450 ∼ −21 mag and another peak at M1450 < −22.0
mag. Considering that the quasar selection complete-
ness is very low at M1450 > −22 mag, the large frac-
tion of faint quasar candidates at M1450 > −22 mag
are likely to be contaminated by z ∼ 5 galaxies that are
known to be the dominant population at those magni-
tudes. To remove galaxy interlopers, we considered the
candidates with M1450 < −22.0 mag as our ﬁnal quasar
candidates. The number of the ﬁnal candidates is 35
with (cid:104)zphot(cid:105) ∼ 5.0, excluding a spectroscopically con-
ﬁrmed galaxy at z ∼ 5 (Ono et al. 2018) mentioned in
Section 4.4. The HSC-SSP photometry of 35 ﬁnal can-
didates is listed in Table 3 and their SED-ﬁtting results
are plotted in Figure 4.

5. QUASAR LUMINOSITY FUNCTION AT Z ∼ 5

To construct the quasar LF at z ∼ 5.0, we assumed
one redshift bin ranging = 4.4 − 5.8 and split the 49
visually inspected candidates with −26 < M1450 < −21
into six magnitude bins with ∆M1450 = 1.0 or 0.5 mag.
It is worth noting that the binned LFs were calculated
with 49 of the 53 visually-inspected candidates, only the
ﬁnal candidates of 35 were used for deriving a parametric
LF due to the possible contamination from the high-
redshift galaxies in the binned LFs with M1450 > −22.0
mag.

To describe the bright end of the quasar LF, we used
96 bright quasars at z ∼ 5 from Yang et al. (2016). We
redistributed the bright quasar sample to four M1450
bins covering -28.5 to -27.0 mag, considering the dif-
ferences between the adopted cosmological parameters
in our and their works.
In the same manner, we ad-
ditionally secured quasars with moderate luminosity
(M1450 = −27.0 to −23.0) from K20 to better deter-
mine the quasar LF.

We calculated the eﬀective survey volume using the
updated 1/Va method (Page & Carrera 2000). In the
original version of 1/Va method, the volume available to
ﬁnd the quasar at a given redshift range does not con-
sider a dependency of the maximum detectable redshift
on a given luminosity, while the updated 1/Va method
does. Thus, the updated 1/Va method can estimate the
survey volume accurately, especially for a faint magni-
tude bin near the detection limit of the survey.

et al. (2020). We also recovered a candidate with a
probability to be a quasar Pqso = 1 in McGreer et al.
(2018), CFHTLS J021800.49-044718.5, and another pos-
sible AGN at z = 4.549 in Chaves-Montero et al. (2017),
ALH3L490. In addition, our candidates include a spec-
troscopically conﬁrmed galaxy at z ∼ 5 (Ono et al. 2018,
refer to Section 6.3.1).

4.5. Final candidates

To assess whether a visually inspected candidate was
realistic or not, we checked the probability of ﬁnding
each candidate in our survey. First, we made a com-
pleteness function shown in Figure 3, F (z, M1450), of
our survey. This function is the fraction of the quasars
satisfying the pre-, DL, and ∆BIC selections among our
simulated quasars within given bin sizes of ∆M1450 =
0.1 mag and ∆z = 0.05. One hundred quasar models are
in each bin. Note that we gave additional errors to the
model magnitudes. The errors were randomly sampled
from a normal distribution determined from the model
magnitude and the imaging depths.

Figure 3 shows that the 53 quasar candidates se-
lected with the DL+BIC+Visual inspection have a bi-
modal distribution, with a peak in their numbers at

We calculated the binned LFs based on the samples
and survey completeness maps of Yang et al. (2016),
K20, and our survey. Except for ours, we re-scaled the
binned LFs at z ∼ 5.05 to z ∼ 5.0 using the relation
about the redshift evolution of number density at the
break magnitude, Φ∗(z) = Φ∗(z = 6) × 10k(z−6) with
k=-0.47 (Fan et al. 2001). Table 4 provides the binned
LFs for quasars in Yang et al. (2016) and K20, and the
49 quasar candidates in our survey. Our binned LFs at
M1450 > −22.0 mag increase dramatically as shown in
Figure 5, implying possible galaxy contamination.

To obtain the parametric quasar LF, we introduced a
double power-law function of which the form is expressed
as,

6. DISCUSSION

6.1. Comparison with previous LFs and implications

on IGM ionization

As we explained earlier, we consider our quasar UV LF
to be reliable down to M1450 = −22.0 mag, which goes
about 1 mag deeper than the recent LFs (N20, K20).
Here, we compare our LF with previous LFs in several
aspects.

xii

Shin, Im & Kim

LF, but their LF at faint end is about 10 × higher than
ours. Shen et al. (2020) discuss a possible tension of
AGN LF of Giallongo et al. (2019) with other LFs. The
AGN LF of Giallongo et al. (2019) has been considered
as a possible evidence for quasars making non-negligible
contribution to IGM ionization at z ∼ 5 (e.g., Grazian
et al. 2020, 2022). Our LF, along with other previous
LFs, shows a rather low number density of faint AGNs,
supporting claims for quasars contributing little in IGM
ionization at z ∼ 5 (McGreer et al. 2018; K20; Shin
et al. 2020).

N20 used color-selected quasar candidates as well as a
few spectroscopically conﬁrmed quasars to derive quasar
LF. They excluded the binned LFs at M1450 (cid:46) −23.3
mag due to possible contamination by Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs). On the other hand, we extend our LF
to M1450 (cid:46) −22.0 mag, over one mag fainter than the
N20 limit. At M1450 = −22.0 mag, the quasar number
density from our work is several times smaller than N20
LF, suggesting an eﬃcient rejection of LBGs through
our selection method. We discuss this point in detail in
the next subsections.

Finally, we note that our binned LF at −22 < M1450 <
−21 is comparable to the LFs of Giallongo et al. (2019)
and Boutsia et al. (2018), although our faintest quasar
sample is signiﬁcantly contaminated by LBGs. The ex-
pected level of contamination is very high, with (cid:38) 12% of
LBGs contaminating the quasar sample at these magni-
tudes (Section 6.2). Correcting such a level of LBG con-
tamination would bring the binned LF points down to
the extrapolated portion of the parametric LF or below
it. Therefore, the binned LFs at −22 < M1450 < −21
mag can serve as another evidence against z ∼ 5 quasars
making a signiﬁcant contribution to the IGM ioniza-
tion. One caveat is that AGNs at these magnitudes
may not appear as quasars (point-like sources) and have
their light dominated by host galaxies. Our selection
method would miss such objects since we pick up point
sources with quasar-type SEDs as quasars (e.g., Kim &
Im 2021).

6.2. Recovery of known quasars with our selection

We examine how many known quasars are recovered
by our selection method. There are six z ∼ 5 quasars
identiﬁed by spectroscopy in our survey area (McGreer
et al. 2013; Pˆaris et al. 2018; Shin et al. 2020) and three
medium-band selected quasars reported in Shin et al.

work is marked with hot pink pentagons. The re-binned LF
of quasars in Yang et al. (2016) and K20 are shown in the or-
ange squares and the green diamonds, respectively. The pink
solid (dash-dotted) line represents our parametric LF with-
out (with) K20. These binned and parametric LFs from our
work are similar to those of the recently reported LFs (K20,
N20, Shen et al. 2020) at M1450 < −23.5. The empty pen-
tagon and star points indicate the bins not used for obtaining
a parametric quasar LF in this work and N20, respectively,
considering potentially high galaxy contamination. Contrary
to several works, binned LFs of Boutsia et al. (2018) and Gi-
allongo et al. (2019) show a high number density at the faint
end.

−0.03) and K20 (α ∼ −1.2+1.36

We note that our two best-ﬁt faint-ends (α ∼

−0.19) are consistent with those
of N20 (α ∼ −2.0+0.40
−0.64), which
are based on a deep and wide-area surveys (> 80 deg2),
within 1-σ level. McGreer et al. (2018) derived a steeper
faint-end slope (α ∼ −1.97+0.09
−0.09) than ours. However,
their value should be taken with a caution since the LF
of McGreer et al. (2018) is based mostly on quasars with
M1450 < −24 mag. Kulkarni et al. (2019) also showed
a steep α of ∼ −2.31 using the same dataset of Mc-
Greer et al. (2013) plus Glikman et al. (2011), but their
data points are limited to M1450 < −24 (McGreer et al.
2018) or a small number statistics due to a coverage of
∼ 2 deg2 (Glikman et al. 2011). Clearly, this compari-
son demonstrates how uncertain the LF faint-end slope
could be without suﬃciently deep data.

ten ﬁlters at least (right) consisting of HSC-SSP, near-infrared, and medium-band ﬁlters in Shin et al. (2020). The dark gray

SSP and near-infrared ﬁlters (red), and medium-band ﬁlters (green) are marked with points. The blue open circles with arrows
indicate the detection limit in the case of non-detection.

quasars and two of the medium-band selected quasars
are recovered as the ﬁnal sample, HSC J021844-044824
(spectroscopically conﬁrmed) and IMS J160732+544750
(a medium-band selected quasar in Shin et al. 2020) dis-
satisfy the ∆BIC criterion with ∆BIC ∼ 5 in this work.
Missing 2 out of 9 quasars (22 % of the sample) can
be explained by the completeness of the survey. The
brighter one, HSC J021844-044824 is at z = 4.5 which
corresponds to the parameter space where the complete-
ness is low (∼ 0.27). IMS J160732+544750 at z ∼ 5 has
a low luminosity of M1450 = −22.9 mag where the com-
pleteness starts declining rapidly.

As demonstrated in the right panels of Figure 6, the
selection can be improved with additional ﬁlters. For
example, IMS J160732+544750 was selected as a quasar
with an addition of a medium-band and NIR upper lim-
its (Shin et al. 2020). HSC J021844-044824 could have
been selected as a quasar if there was an additional NIR
band data.
In conclusion, our selection method with
HSC-SSP photometry data may miss ∼ 22% (2/9) of
known quasars at z ∼ 5. However, the quasar recov-
ery can be improved by including additional multi-band
data.

6.3. Contamination rate of our quasar survey

6.3.1. High-redshift galaxies

We checked if our quasar sample is contaminated by
high-redshift galaxies using spectroscopically conﬁrmed
galaxies at z ∼ 4 − 7 from HSC-SSP (Ono et al. 2018).
This is because of two reasons: 1) Several quasar sur-
veys have indicated a high contamination rate of high-

redshift quasars samples by high-redshift galaxies in a
faint regime (Matsuoka et al. 2018; N20). The num-
ber density of LBGs is signiﬁcantly higher than that
of quasars at M1450 > −23 mag (Ono et al. 2018; see
Figure 9), and 2) our selection has no explicit criteria
for separating high-redshift galaxies from quasars at z
∼ 5. Speciﬁcally, the DL selection considers the i-band-
selected point sources only, and the BIC statistics makes
use of the star models only.

We searched for spectroscopically conﬁrmed galaxies
at z ∼ 5 in our survey area and found 8 galaxies with
i < 25 mag at 4.0 < zspec < 6.0. Among them, we ﬁnd
only one galaxy at z ∼ 5.0 satisfy the pre-, DL, and
∆BIC criteria of our quasar selection, meaning that the
contamination of the sample by Lyman-break galaxies
is low at 12.5% (1/8). The pre-selection reduced the
galaxy number from 8 to 5. The DL selection removes
another galaxy, and the ∆BIC calculation removes 3 out
of 4 galaxies passing the pre- and DL selections.

We compared the galaxy contamination rate of our
selection method with a traditional high-redshift quasar
selection made from a color-color diagram. High-
redshift objects show a distinctive feature in color-color
space due to redshifted Lyman break, and are often se-
lected from a speciﬁc region in a color-color space (e.g.,
see Shim et al. 2007; Kang & Im 2009 for galaxies; Choi
et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2015; Jeon et al. 2017 for quasars).
N20 selected z ∼ 5 quasars based on their broad-band
colors and point source appearance, and noticed possi-
ble, signiﬁcant contamination of their sample by galax-
ies at M1450 ∼ −23 mag. We applied the N20 color

selection criteria to our point sources, ﬁnding that the
galaxy contamination fraction is 3/8 (37.5 % contamina-
tion rate). This example demonstrates that our quasar
selection adopting the DL and BIC statistics can lower
the contamination rate of the quasar sample by compact
galaxies by a few times.

The role of each selection process in selecting ﬁnal
quasar candidates and evaluating the suitability of its
criterion are discussed further below. First, we checked
the dependency of the contamination rate on the point

source selection cut in the pre-selection process.
looser cut (i−iCModel < 0.3) was adopted instead of 0.2,
we have three more galaxies (i.e., 8/8 of known galax-
ies in the area) as quasar candidates in the pre-selection
process. However, after applying the DL and BIC se-
lections, the remaining galaxy is one at z ∼ 5.0, which
is identical to the case of the tighter point source cut.
The contamination rate of the quasar selection process
is insensitive to the choice of point source selection if the
cut is realistic enough to contain almost all of the point
sources.

DL selects 4/5 galaxies satisfying the pre-selection cri-
teria. This means that our DL process is not very eﬀec-
tive in excluding z ∼ 5 galaxies from the sample. On the
other hand, the ∆BIC calculation based on the best-ﬁt
result of SED-ﬁtting could exclude 3/4 remaining galax-
ies in quasar candidates, suggesting its eﬀectiveness in
reducing the galaxy contamination.

To ﬁgure out the reason why the ∆BIC calculation im-
proves the faint quasar selection, we compared the SEDs
of 9 quasar/quasar candidates (McGreer et al. 2018;
Shin et al. 2020) with those of 8 LBGs (Ono et al. 2018)
with i < 25 at 4.0 < zspec < 6.0 by normalizing them to

their i-band ﬂuxes. Then, we calculated the mean SED
for the quasar (‘QSO’ class) and LBGs (‘LBG’ class),
and the 68th percentile region of two classes for each
band. In Figure 7, we show the diﬀerence between the
mean SEDs of the two classes. The mean SED of the
‘QSO’ sample has redder colors than that of the ‘LBG’
sample due to the bluer continuum slope of LBGs than
quasars at high redshift (e.g., Jiang et al. 2013). This
distinctive feature could not be adequately sampled in
color selections using 3 to 4 broadband ﬁlters, whereas
our selection could extract the feature and ﬁlter out can-
didates whose SEDs are dissimilar to the quasar SED
models.

Since the BIC is related to the χ2 value of the best-ﬁt
model, the absolute value of ∆BIC decreases as the pho-
tometric uncertainties increase.
Indeed, the fractions
of the DL-selected candidates satisfying the ∆BIC> 10
at i < 23 mag and i > 23 mag are ∼ 0.19 and 0.05,
respectively. Therefore, the exclusion of galaxies from
the quasar sample through the ∆BIC selection may be
merely due to the ∆BIC selection preferentially exclud-
ing faint objects (i < 23 mag) with large photometric
errors. Hence, we estimated how the photometric un-
certainties inﬂuence the ∆BIC selection at fainter mag-
nitudes.

To do so, we added median magnitude errors of the
HSC-SSP sources with i = 24 mag to DL-selected can-
didates with i < 23 mag, and repeated the ∆BIC se-
lection. Note that i = 24 mag is close to the i-band
magnitude of the faintest quasar candidate. The frac-
tion of DL-selected candidates passing the ∆BIC selec-
tion decreases only moderately from the original 0.19
to ∼ 0.14 for this noise-added sample, not as much as

0.05 in the real data. Therefore, the photometric error
only partially explains the decreasing fraction of the ex-
cluded candidates through the ∆BIC selection at fainter
magnitudes. This result supports our suggestion that
the ∆BIC selection excludes high-redshift galaxies eﬃ-
ciently, which are expected to be more numerous among
the fainter UV high-redshift sources. Additional deep
spectroscopy of the ﬁnal candidates would validate this
conclusion.

6.3.2. Stars and quiescent galaxies

Common contaminants in high-redshift quasar sur-
veys are faint stars whose colors are similar to those
of quasars (e.g., Matsuoka et al. 2019). To estimate
the fraction of stars satisfying our selection criteria, we
generated a mock catalog of 100,000 stars uniformly
distributed in i < 24 based on stellar model spectra
(Section 3.2.2) and scaled their SEDs to i = 24 mag.
Their magnitude errors are assigned by randomly select-
ing a value from a Gaussian distribution of which stan-
dard deviations are median magnitude errors of HSC-
SSP sources that have similar magnitudes to theirs.
We adopted this approach because few spectroscopically
conﬁrmed faint stars (i > 22.5 mag) are in the Deep
layer of the HSC-SSP. Among the 100,000 randomly
sampled mock stars, 100,000 and 20,131 stars pass the
pre-selection criteria (1) and (3), assuming the extend-
edness values of all stars are within 0.2. 3,213/20,131
stars are DL-selected candidates, however, the BIC se-
lection ﬁnds no promising candidate in the 3,213 can-
didates due to their redder colors (i − N B816, i − z,
i − N B921, and i − y) than those of quasars. As a re-
sult, the fraction of pre-selected faint stars passing our
DL and ∆BIC selection criteria is 0/20,131.

Another possible contaminants are quiescent galaxies
at 0.5 < z < 1.0 whose 4,000 ˚A breaks can mimic sharp
Lyman breaks of quasars at z ∼ 5 (Euclid Collaboration
et al. 2019). To test how many quiescent galaxies can be
selected with our selection process, we prepared a cata-
log of quiescent galaxies at 0.5 < z < 1.0 from Weaver
et al. (2022) in the COSMOS ﬁeld, which are selected
to be objects that form red envelope in the r − i color
and photometric redshift space (e.g., Im et al. 2002). In
a 0.3 deg2 area where the multi-band HSC-SSP Deep
and COSMOS ﬁelds overlap, we identiﬁed 1,847 quies-
cent galaxies with i ≤ 24 mag at 0.5 < z < 1.0 within a
matching radius of 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)0.

These galaxies have a median i-band magnitude of
∼ 22 mag. Hence, we rescaled their SEDs to i = 24 mag
by adding the diﬀerence between i = 24 and their i-band
magnitudes to their SEDs. We increased the quiescent
galaxy sample size up to 100,000 by assigning photo-

metric uncertainties to the rescaled magnitudes. The
uncertainties were randomly given in the same way as
the mock stars. Among the 100,000 simulated galaxies,
87,801 galaxies meet the pre-selection criteria (1) and
(3) based on an assumption that they satisfy our point
source selection cut. Although DL classiﬁes 538/87,801
galaxies as qso candidates, the ∆BIC calculation ﬁlters
out all the candidates, resulting in the fraction of pre-
selected quiescent galaxies satisfying our DL and ∆BIC
selection of 0/87,801.

Given that there are 125,644 sources passing the pre-
selection criteria, the very low contamination rates by
pre-selected, simulated stars (0/20,131) and quiescent
galaxies at 0.5 < z < 1.0 (0/87,801) imply that these
two types of objects cannot signiﬁcantly contaminate
the quasar candidates sample. This is because that pho-
tometric errors of HSC-SSP Deep data are small enough
at our eﬀective depth of i < 24 to accurately trace red
colors of late-type stars and detect g-band ﬂuxes of qui-
escent galaxies at good SNRs. When we calculated the
FPR of the DL and BIC selection for nqso objects, it
was as low as 0.015%. This expected FPR is in line
with the fractions calculated from the above results.

6.4. Comparison of DL and color selections

To compare the performance of the DL selection
with that of traditional color selection method, we de-
vised three diﬀerent types of color cuts (‘Loose’, ‘Best’,
‘Tight’) in r − i versus i − z (riz) and r − i versus i − y
(riy) spaces. These cuts are guided by considering the
distribution of quasar models at z = 4.5 − 5.5 on each
color space. The ‘Loose’ cut represents a selection cut
for maximizing the recovery rate of the quasar mod-
els (i.e., minimizing the miss rate of quasars, minimiz-
ing FNR), whereas the ‘Tight’ cut indicates a selection
cut for minimizing contamination rate (i.e., minimizing
FPR). The ‘Best’ cut stands for an optimal cut select-
ing as many quasars as possible while minimizing con-
taminants. Figure 8 shows these cuts, our DL-selected
candidates, and 35 ﬁnal candidates. As shown in the
ﬁgure, even if the ‘Loose’ cut is applied, two of the 35
candidates are excluded, implying that DL selection is
eﬀective in including more quasars in the candidate sam-
ple. The ‘Tight’ cut encloses 74 % of the 35 candidates,
whereas the color cuts used in N20 miss about a half
of the candidates, since the cuts of N20 are tailored for
quasars only at z = 4.7 to 5.1.

Figure 9, we present the confusion matrices for the
three cases of color criteria. The ‘Loose’ cut has the
highest recovery rate of quasar models (e.g., True Pos-
itive Rate, TPR) among the three cases, but the con-
tamination rate in the quasar selection is also very high

i-band-selected point sources with i < 25 mag and quasar models. The 1,599 DL-selected candidates are marked with gray dots.
The stars indicate the conﬁrmed quasar or promising candidates reported in Shin et al. (2020), while the pentagons represent the
35 quasar candidates used for constructing the parametric LF. These stars and pentagons are color-coded by their photometric
redshifts. The dotted, dashed, and solid lines correspond to the ‘Loose’, ‘Best’, and ‘Tight’ color selection criteria, respectively.
Color cuts used in N20 are marked with the navy lines in the riy color space.

as we compute for the confusion matrix of deep learning shown in Figure 2.

(∼ 30%). The ‘Tight’ cut shows a very low contami-
nation rate in the quasar sample, but misses ∼ 45% of
quasar models. The ‘Best’ cut has relatively reasonable
FPR and TPR, however, its FPR is ∼ 3 times larger
than that of DL selection (∼ 0.5%) and its TPR is well
below that of the DL selection (∼ 100%). Compared to
color selections, the DL selection gives a high recovery
rate of quasars with a low FPR. For example, the DL
method can select quasar candidates at z ∼ 4.5 which
is diﬃcult to do so in the color cut method. One can
loosen the color cuts to make it as inclusive as DL for
quasar selection. But, this makes FPR too large (60× or

more of DL), and hence selects too many contaminants
that the ∆BIC selection needs to weed out (1,500 for DL
versus 9,000 for color cut). DL is a more complete, eﬃ-
cient selection method than traditional color selections.
A shortcoming of DL is that it cannot account for the
diﬀerence between the absolute number of nqso and qso
objects, but this can be augmented with an additional
selection procedure such as the ∆BIC calculation.

7. SUMMARY

To construct a quasar LF at z ∼ 5, we selected quasars

selections. Quasars were chosen from the Deep layer of
the HSC-SSP imaging survey covering 15.5 deg2.

We found that our selection outperforms traditional
selection methods based on color cuts, sampling more
quasars at a wider redshift range while minimizing con-
tamination from LBGs. The former advantage was
made possible by DL with its ﬂexible color criteria. The
latter merit was achieved through the ∆BIC selection
that enabled us to distinguish quasar SEDs from bluer
SEDs of LBGs. Compared to the color selection of
N20, we achieved three times less contamination rate
by galaxies at z ∼ 5. Our selection process recovered
most of conﬁrmed quasars as well.

Thanks to our selection, we constructed a z ∼ 5 quasar
LF reaching M1450 = −22.0 mag, about 1 magnitude
deeper than previous LFs. The overall shape of the LF
is similar to LFs in recent works at z ∼ 5 (N20; K20)
down to M1450 ∼ −24.0 mag, indicating a ﬂatter faint-
end slope of α = −1.60+0.21
−0.19 than some previous studies
(McGreer et al. 2018; Kulkarni et al. 2019). We even
tried to estimate the LF at -22 to -21 mag. Knowing
that the faintest quasar sample could be contaminated
by LBGs signiﬁcantly (about 10% or more of LBGs clas-
siﬁed as quasars), the LF at the faintest bins agrees with
the ﬂatter faint-end slope. These results suggest that
quasars – AGNs with point-like appearance – are not
contributing signiﬁcantly to the IGM ionization.

In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility of our
selection and the importance of attempting a novel and
eﬃcient approach to select promising quasar candidates
from numerous faint objects. Future spectroscopic ob-
servations of our ﬁnal quasar candidates will conﬁrm
the validity of our method, and adding multi-wavelength
data would help select high-redshift quasars more reli-
ably.
