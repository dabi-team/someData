Abstract

This study investigates the role of large-scale environments on the fraction of spiral galaxies
at z = 0.3–0.6 sliced to three redshift bins of ∆z = 0.1. Here, we sample 276 220 massive
galaxies in a limited stellar mass of 5 × 1010 solar mass (∼ M ∗) over 360 deg2, as obtained
from the Second Public Data Release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program
(HSC-SSP). By combining projected two-dimensional density information (Shimakawa et al.
2021) and the CAMIRA cluster catalog (Oguri et al. 2018), we investigate the spiral fraction
across large-scale overdensities and in the vicinity of red sequence clusters. We adopt transfer
learning to signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of labeling spiral galaxies and then perform stacking
analysis across the entire ﬁeld to overcome the limitations of sample size. Here we employ
a morphological classiﬁcation catalog by the Galaxy Zoo Hubble (Willett et al. 2017) to train
the deep learning model. Based on 74 103 sources classiﬁed as spirals, we ﬁnd moderate
morphology–density relations on ten comoving Mpc scale, thanks to the wide-ﬁeld coverage
of HSC-SSP. Clear deﬁcits of spiral galaxies have also been conﬁrmed, in and around 1136
red sequence clusters. Furthermore, we verify whether there is a large-scale environmental
dependence on rest-frame u − r colors of spiral galaxies; however, such a tendency was not
observed in our sample.

1 Introduction

Physical mechanisms of environmental impacts on galaxy
formation and evolution, and even the very existence of
such eﬀects, have been long-standing controversial topics,
depending on such an evolutionary phase, a cosmic time,

red sequence, since redshift ∼ 2 or less (de Vaucouleurs
1961; Visvanathan and Sandage 1977; Butcher and Oemler
1984; Bower et al. 1992; Bower et al. 1998; Terlevich et al.
2001; Gladders and Yee 2005; White et al. 2005; Kodama
et al. 2007; Cooper et al. 2007; Muzzin et al. 2008; Mei
et al. 2009; Rykoﬀ et al. 2014; Oguri et al. 2018). Such
color dependencies on the local galaxy over-density have
been veriﬁed in more diversiﬁed environments via extensive
wide-ﬁeld surveys covering more than a hundred square
degrees (Balogh et al. 2004; Tanaka et al. 2005; Baldry et
al. 2006; Skibba et al. 2009; Peng et al. 2010; Alpaslan
et al. 2015; Costa-Duarte et al. 2018). Indeed, less active
star formations of cluster galaxies have been detected in
various observations, which suggests that dense environ-
ments induce star formation quenching (Kauﬀmann et al.
2004; Poggianti et al. 2006; Wetzel et al. 2012; Wetzel et al.
2013; Muzzin et al. 2014; Old et al. 2020). Environmental
quenching is often regarded as a quenching process, to-
gether with mass-dependent star formation quenching
(Peng et al. 2010; Gr¨utzbauch et al. 2011; Peng et al. 2012).

The morphology–density relation, which is the primary
focus of this paper, is a more contentious research topic
than the environmental dependence of galaxy colors, which
refers to the increase in disk early-type (S0) galaxies in
dense regions, at the cost of a fraction of spiral galax-
ies (Dressler 1980; Larson et al. 1980; Dressler et al.
1997; Couch et al. 1998; Goto et al. 2003a; Smith et al.
2005; Postman et al. 2005; Capak et al. 2007; Guzzo et al.
2007; van der Wel 2008; Poggianti et al. 2009; Tasca et al.
2009; Cappellari et al. 2011; Lietzen et al. 2012; Houghton
et al. 2013; Fogarty et al. 2014). The relationship appar-
ently indicates a morphological transition of star-forming
galaxies to the early-type galaxies owing to environmen-
tal eﬀects like ram pressure stripping and gas strangula-
tion (Moran et al. 2007; Wolf et al. 2009; Kovaˇc et al.
2010; Vulcani et al. 2011). However, previous studies have
reported that such an apparent environmental dependence
tends to almost disappear at a ﬁxed stellar mass, especially
at the high mass end, thus suggesting that the mass would
primarily control such an observational trend (e.g. Holden
et al. 2007; Bamford et al. 2009, and see also Brough et al.
2017; Veale et al. 2017; Greene et al. 2017 for the kinematic
morphology–density relation in early-type galaxies).

Moreover, quite importantly, a signiﬁcant ﬂuctuation in
the environmental dependence would exist, just as there
is a great diversity of galaxy clusters (Rood and Sastry
1971; Butcher and Oemler 1984; Goto 2005; Hashimoto
et al. 2019). Recent wide-ﬁeld deep legacy surveys have
determined more than a thousand cluster samples by sys-
tematic cluster search out to z ∼ 1, e.g., CAMIRA (Oguri
et al. 2018), AMICO (Maturi et al. 2019), and X-CLASS

(Koulouridis et al. 2021). Besides, we have free access to
the wide-ﬁeld projected density map at z < 1 over 360 deg2
(Shimakawa et al. 2021). These libraries that suﬃciently
cover the sample size and survey volume will enable us
to obtain a more systematic perspective on environmental
dependence across a formation history of the large-scale
structure.

Therefore, this motivates us to revisit the morphology–
density relation using large data-sets based on wide-ﬁeld
deep data. Speciﬁcally, we obtain the sample from the
Second Public Data Release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program (Aihara et al. 2019; hereafter
referred to as the HSC-SSP PDR2), as well as the density
map (Shimakawa et al. 2021) and CAMIRA cluster catalog
(Oguri et al. 2018), both of which are based on the HSC-
SSP PDR2 library (§2). Furthermore, this research em-
ploys a novel approach, transfer learning (Bozinovski and
Fulgosi 1976; Pratt 1993), to achieve an eﬀective search of
spiral galaxies from big data (§3). Transfer learning is a
machine-learning technique occasionally used for the clas-
siﬁcations of galaxy mergers (Ackermann et al. 2018) and
radio galaxies (Tang et al. 2019), including the applica-
tion of a visual morphology classiﬁcation to another survey
(Dom´ınguez S´anchez et al. 2019). Based on the deep learn-
ing classiﬁcation, we investigate the environmental depen-
dence of spiral fractions on 10 comoving Mpc (co-Mpc)
scale and in the vicinity of galaxy clusters (§4). This study
primarily focuses on such a large-scale environmental eﬀect
by taking advantage of the wide-ﬁeld coverage (360 deg2)
and owing to photometric redshift errors on the backside.
Finally, we discuss obtained results and summarize this
research in the last section (§5 and §6).

Similar to our previous work (Shimakawa et al. 2021),
this study adopts the AB magnitude system (Oke and
Gunn 1983) and the Chabrier (2003) initial mass function.
We also assume cosmological parameters, ΩM = 0.279,
ΩΛ = 0.721, and h = 0.7, in a ﬂat lambda cold dark matter
model, which are consistent with those from the WMAP
nine-year data (Hinshaw et al. 2013). When referring to
our ﬁgures or tables, we designate their initials by capital
letters (e.g., Fig. 1, Table 1, Section 1) to avoid confu-
sion with those in the literature (e.g., ﬁg. 1, table 1, or
section 1).

2 Data

This section overviews an original sample obtained from
the HSC-SSP PDR2, which is applied in the density mea-
surement in our previous work (Shimakawa et al. 2021).
We then examine how to prepare an imaging data-set for
selecting spiral galaxies from our sample.

and i sdsscentroid flag (Coupon et al. 2018; Aihara et
al. 2019; Bosch et al. 2018, table 2).

Photometric redshifts and stellar masses of the sam-
ple are derived from Mizuki, a SED-based photo-z code
(Tanaka 2015). The biweight dispersion of ∆z = |zspec −
zphoto| is ≤ 0.04, and the outlier rate (|∆z| > 0.15) is ∼ 0.1
for the HSC-SSP sources at i < 23 mag (see Tanaka et al.
2018, table 2 for more details). We solely utilize samples
that satisfy the reduced chi-square χν < 5 of the best-ﬁtting
following the recommendation in Tanaka et al.
model,
(2018), section 7. For the sample at redshift z = [0.4 : 0.5),
we set a further selection threshold to minimize an un-
certainty from a Balmer–Lyman break degeneracy. Since
misclassiﬁed samples at z ∼ 3 tend to exhibit very young
ages (∼ 1 Gyr) with high speciﬁc star-formation rates (> 1
Gyr−1) in the Mizuki, we discard such sources.

In addition, we conduct a sanity check on the stellar
mass measurement by Mizuki at z = [0.3 : 1.0) using only
the grizy photometry available in HSC-SSP as compared
to those by COSMOS2015 (Laigle et al. 2016), which are
based on 34-band photometry (Fig. 1). The HSC-only
measurement restricted to the optical regime generally
tends to overestimate stellar masses of galaxies at higher
redshifts (z >
∼ 0.6) and lower stellar masses (<
∼ a few 1010
solar mass). However, Fig. 1 shows that we can obtain
logical values for massive galaxies at z <
∼ 0.6, whose rest-
frame optical wavelength can be covered optimally by zy
ﬁlters. We therefore decide to adopt massive galaxies at
z = [0.3 : 0.6), with stellar masses greater than 5×1010 solar
mass, which approximately corresponds to the characteris-
tic stellar mass at that redshift (Ilbert et al. 2010; Davidzon
et al. 2017). There are 276 220 galaxies that meet these
requirements. Such thresholds are also selected from the
seeing limit perspective (FWHM = 0.7 arcsec). It is sub-
stantially challenging for the seeing-limited data to resolve
the morphology of more compact (i.e., lower-mass) galax-
ies and higher-z sources.

2.2 Density map and galaxy cluster sample

We select an area of 360 deg2 from the HSC-SSP Wide
layer (Aihara et al. 2019, see ﬁgure 1), where the projected
2D density maps are available (Shimakawa et al. 2021). In
practice, the survey ﬁelds are organized by ﬁve large ar-
eas, one of which is illustrated in Fig. 2 as an example.
Shimakawa et al. (2021) selected the survey area in an
i-band limiting magnitude (5σ) of point-spread-function
(PSF) in two arcsec diameters deeper than 26 mag. They
also discard problematic ﬁelds adversely aﬀected by bright
stars (< 17.5 mag) at a rate of more than 50 percent (see
section 2 in the literature). We verify that our mask cor-

with those by (y-axis) Laigle et al. (2016), which use all photometric bands
available in the COSMOS ﬁeld (Scoville et al. 2007). The median values are
depicted by the circles (colors of the symbols vary depending on the redshift
bin as denoted in the legend). The black solid vertical line indicates the
stellar mass limit (M(cid:63) = 5 × 1010 M(cid:12)) determined in this work.

2.1 HSC-SSP PDR2

This work is based on data, all of which have been avail-
able in the public database of the HSC-SSP PDR21 since
May 30, 2019 (Aihara et al. 2019). The database includes
all data taken from March 2014 to January 2018 (refer
to Aihara et al. 2019, table 2 for further details) with
the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope
(Miyazaki et al. 2018; Furusawa et al. 2018; Kawanomoto
et al. 2018; Komiyama et al. 2018). Using the database, we
can access the science-ready source catalog and reduced ﬁts
data generated by the dedicated pipeline termed hscPipe
(Bosch et al. 2018).

Throughout this study, we employ only luminous
galaxies in a limited stellar mass of M(cid:63) = 5 × 1010 solar
mass at a photometric redshift range of z = [0.3 : 0.6). The
sample is originally based on approximately eight million
i-band magnitude limited (< 23 mag) sources of the study
by Shimakawa et al. (2021). They are detected in all
HSC bands (grizy) with more than ﬁve sigma detections
in the cmodel measurement (see Bosch et al. 2018,
§4.9.9 and Abazajian et al. 2004, §3.1 for details of the
cmodel magnitude). Suspicious detections are excluded

2.3 Image preparation

This research utilizes gray-scale images from i-band data,
consisting of relatively homogeneous and better-seeing
data (FWHM ∼ 0.55 arcsec) than those in the other pho-
tometric bands (see e.g., Shimakawa et al. 2021, ﬁg. 2).
The HSC i-band ﬁlter captures the rest-frame 4400–6500
˚A of our targets at z = [0.3 : 0.6). Beyond the techni-
cal reason above, we prefer to adopt the gray-scale than
the multi-band colored image to avoid a color–morphology
dependency (e.g., de Vaucouleurs 1961; Schawinski et al.
2014) that may produce a classiﬁcation bias. We employ
samples with seeing FWHM < 0.7 arcsec and then perform
Gaussian smoothing for every data to match their seeing
sizes to FWHM = 0.7 arcsec, based on the seeing infor-
mation in the corresponding patch of the HSC-SSP PDR2
library.

We convert i-band data of the targets into the machine-
friendly gray-scale images by following the form of the arc-
sinh stretch, F (x) ≡ arcsinh(x/β), proposed by Lupton et
al. (1999); Lupton et al. (2004), where x is a ﬂux count per
pixel in the i-band, and β is the softening parameter (in
this work, β = 1 × 10−3). The zero-point magnitude of the
i-band data is scaled to 19 mag (default in hscMap2) from
the original value in HSC-SSP (27 mag). A normalization
formula is described as follows,

f (x) =






0
F (x − m)/F (M − m)
1

(x < m)
(m ≤ x ≤ M )
(M < x),

(1)

where m is an undercut value (m = 5 × 10−5) and M rep-
resents an upper limit deﬁned to be the maximum count
within the central region of individuals (3 × 3 pixels) in
this study. Subsequently, we cut out and convert the nor-
malized data into the png format with the image size of
(64 × 64) pixels (corresponding to 10.75 × 10.75 arcsec2),
to turn the data cube into a deep learning model (§3.1).
Examples of normalized images can be found in Fig. 6 and
7 in the next section.

3 Galaxy classiﬁcation

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce our machine-learning-
based approach (§3.1) and explain how to train and vali-
date the classiﬁcation model by referencing it to the archive
catalog, Galaxy Zoo Hubble (Willett et al. 2017) in §3.2.
We then select spiral galaxies by applying the trained
model to the normalized cutouts of the main targets (§3.3).

Fig. 2. Examples of the density map (see Shimakawa et al. 2021 for the
full version). From top to bottom, projected two-dimensional overdensities at
z = [0.3:0.4), [0.4:0.5), and [0.6:0.7), respectively. The color map depicts the
density excess in standard deviation (σr=10Mpc). The overdensity is mea-
sured for i-band magnitude limited galaxies (i < 23) based on r = 10 co-Mpc
aperture. The red cross symbols indicate positions of the CAMIRA clusters
at each redshift slice (Oguri et al. 2018). While the CAMIRA clusters gener-
ally follow the large-scale overdensities, there are some mismatch because
measuring scales and tracers are different in the two density measurements
(see Shimakawa et al. 2021 for more details).

rection provides the number density required at the target
redshift range z = [0.3 : 0.6), which is consistent with that
based on the COSMOS2015 catalog (Laigle et al. 2016).
Detailed information on the density estimation can be
found in Shimakawa et al. (2021), section 3.1. To derive the
overdensity of our sample, we consider values of the density
excess using r = 10 co-Mpc apertures (σr=10Mpc) in three
redshift slices of z = [0.3 : 0.4), [0.4 : 0.5), and [0.5 : 0.6).
Both the galaxy sample and density map are originally
based on a study by Shimakawa et al. (2021). Hence, the
survey areas are completely consistent with each other.

In addition, we employ a red sequence cluster cata-
log obtained from Oguri et al. (2018) to investigate spi-
ral fractions of cluster neighborhoods. The cluster cat-
alog was constructed based on the CAMIRA (Cluster-
ﬁnding Algorithm based on Multi-band Identiﬁcation of
Red-sequence gAlaxies) algorithm (Oguri 2014). The pro-
gram estimates the 3D richness of red sequence galaxies in
a limiting stellar mass of 1010.2 M(cid:12) within one h−1 phys-
ical Mpc (see Oguri 2014 for more detailed information).
We use their catalog correlating to the HSC-SSP PDR2,
which includes the incremental update from the original
version in the literature. We here adopt only cluster sam-
ples above the richness limit of 15, which roughly corre-
sponds to the cluster virial mass of >
∼ 1014 h−1M(cid:12) (Oguri
et al. 2018). Such red sequence cluster samples will enable
us to revisit the well-known morphology–density relation
(Dressler 1980) in and around galaxy clusters at interme-
diate redshifts in a more inclusive manner.

a two-class sigmoid classiﬁer is attached to the Xception model with 36
convolutional layers (Chollet 2016). The parenthesized numbers indicate
the size of the data cube in each process. “BN” means a batch normalization
layer (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015).

3.1 Transfer learning

We applied transfer learning (see, e.g., Bozinovski and
Fulgosi 1976; Pratt 1993 and a review by Tan et al. 2018)
to select spiral galaxies from the entire sample. Transfer
learning is a machine learning technique, where a model
pre-trained on one domain is diverted to another task.
Modern deep learning models preliminarily trained with
large imaging data cubes can be considered experts of fea-
ture recognition, delivering superior performance on galaxy
images by including an adapted classiﬁer, even if they are
total strangers to the models. The major advantage of
adopting transfer learning is that we can signiﬁcantly re-
duce the sample size of the training data-set while keep-
ing a robust classiﬁcation accuracy. This approach has
recently garnered increasing applications in the ﬁeld of
galaxy morphology classiﬁcations for various scientiﬁc pur-
poses (Ackermann et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2019; Dom´ınguez
S´anchez et al. 2019).

1:

In practice, we attached a two-class sigmoid classiﬁer
(0: non-spirals vs.
spirals) to the Xception model
(Chollet 2016) trained with the ImageNet data-set be-
forehand (Russakovsky et al. 2014). Xception is a mod-
ern architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN;
Lecun et al. 1998; Lecun et al. 2015) developed from the
Inception architecture known as GoogLeNet (Simonyan
and Zisserman 2014). Throughout this study, we applied
the deep learning model using TensorFlow (version 2.2.0;
Abadi et al. 2016) and Keras (version 2.3.0; Chollet et al.
2015), under a single GPU, NVIDIA TITAN RTX. When
we seeded random number generators built into programs,
we adopted a ﬁxed seed number of 30. While diﬀerent ini-
tial setups such as random seeds and GPUs would trigger
a negligible mismatch (<
∼ 10 percent, as far as we can as-
certain) of spiral galaxy classiﬁcation among models, the
statistical trends discussed in this paper will not change
(see, e.g., Pietrowski et al. 2021 about hardware-derived

nary cross-entropy loss (Eq. 3; dot-dash lines). The purple and yellow lines
depict records for the training and validation data, respectively. We started
the model training without the ﬁne-tuning (FT), and then switch to that with
the FT since 20 epochs (the black solid vertical line). We employ the model

loss as represented by the red circle.

uncertainties).

An outline of the model architecture is presented in
Fig. 3. The classiﬁer passes through dense layers (linear
transformation), batch normalization (Ioﬀe and Szegedy
2015), and ReLU activation (≡ max(0, x); Glorot et al.
2011), and then outputs the probability value (ˆy = [0 : 1])
through a sigmoid function. All the HSC images are re-
sized from 64 × 64 to 160 × 160 pixels to tailor the in-
put size to the requirement of the Xception architecture
(Chollet 2016). Also, for the same reason, our one-channel
gray-scale data are distributed to all three color channels
(Fig. 3), and their pixel values are standardized in each
channel by the same values used in the pre-training with
the ImageNet (Chollet 2016). The training data are trans-
ferred to the Xception model with data augmentation built
in the Keras library (ImageDataGenerator; Fig. 3), which
performs random image rotation (< 90 degrees), as well as
horizontal and vertical ﬂips.

3.2 Model training

For the model training, we employ i-band magnitude lim-
ited galaxies (i < 22.5) from the HSC-SSP DUD layer
(Aihara et al. 2019), which have counterparts to the
Galaxy Zoo Hubble sources at z = 0.2–0.7 within 1 arc-
sec radius (Willett et al. 2017). We construct their gray-
scale cutouts in the same manner as the primary data
from the HSC-SSP Wide layer, but the imaging depths
of the DUD layer used in this work are by 1.5 mag deeper
than those of the Wide layer. The Galaxy Zoo Hubble of-

formed the model training with the training data of spirals
and non-spirals (N = 1648 for each) and their validation
data (N = 412 for each). We use all spiral galaxies but ran-
domly select 2060 non-spiral galaxies from their whole sam-
ple to maintain the same sample size as spirals. Training
histories of model accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss
are summarized in Fig. 4. The model accuracy is deﬁned
as:

accuracy ≡

T P + T N
T P + T N + F P + F N

,

(2)

where T P (or T N ) and F P (or F N ) represent the numbers
of true positive (or negative) and false positive (or nega-
tive), respectively. The former refers to the number of pre-
dictions where the classiﬁer correctly predicts the positive
(or negative) class as positive (or negative), respectively.
However, the latter refers to the number of failed predic-
tions. The binary cross-entropy loss is described in the
following,

loss ≡ −y log ˆy − (1 − y) log(1 − ˆy),

(3)

where y and ˆy represent the target value {0, 1} and the
probability of spirals [0 : 1], respectively.

We trained the model 170 times, i.e. 170 epochs, with
ﬁne-tuning since the 20th epoch. We then selected the
best set of weight parameters exhibiting the least cross-
entropy loss in the validation data. In the ﬁrst 20 epochs,
we trained only the weights of the classiﬁcation head us-
ing the pre-trained CNN as feature extractor, and then
trained the weights of all the layers of the deep learning
model (so-called ﬁne-tuning technique; Fig. 4). The pa-
rameter tuning was performed by Adam optimizer, an adap-
tive learning rate optimization algorithm (Kingma and Ba
2014), through the stochastic mini-batch training with a
batch size of 32. The model training started with a default
learning rate of lr = 1 × 10−3, and then a learning rate de-
cay (lr → 2 × 10−4) was applied in and after 50 epochs.

Consequently, we adopt the model in the 66th epoch
(Fig. 4) that achieves 92 percent accuracy in both the
training and validation data. The histograms in Fig. 5
summarize precision (completeness) values and fractions
of false detection (contamination) against the probability
for the test data with our ﬁnal model. Here we repro-
duced the gray-scale images of the Galaxy Zoo Hubble
sources from the HSC-SSP Wide layers that we actually
use in the main analysis, which amounts to 11 074 objects.
We then treat them as the test data-set separately from
the training and validation data. Comparison examples
of HST images of the test data with those in the HSC-
SSP Wide layer, including obtained probability values, are
shown in Fig. 6. The ﬁgure indicates that most of the test
samples are successfully classiﬁed as labeled in the Galaxy

no clear redshift dependence of the selection completeness
and contamination within the target redshift range (z =
0.3–0.6).

For fairly selecting spiral galaxies, determining the se-
lection cut of the probability value (ˆy) is a trade-oﬀ be-
tween the selection completeness and contamination rate,
which depend on the intrinsic spiral fraction. When as-
suming a 30 percent spiral fraction, for instance, Fig. 5
suggests that we will have 20 percent of the contamination
rate, while we can achieve nearly 90 percent completeness
of the HST-based spiral galaxies. This work decides to
use ˆy = 0.9 as the selection threshold of spiral galaxies to
reduce the contamination fraction.

3.3 Selection of spiral galaxies

Based on the constructed model, we search for spiral galax-
ies from 276 220 stellar-mass limited samples (§2.1). We se-
lected galaxies with probability values greater than ˆy > 0.9
as spiral galaxies to reduce the contaminant fraction (§3.2).
Consequently, 74 103 objects are classiﬁed as spiral galax-

When assuming the completeness and contamination
rates inferred from the Galaxy Zoo Hubble (§3.2 and
Fig. 5), the corrected spiral fractions at z = 0.3–0.6 are
estimated to be 37–49 percent. These fractions broadly
agree with those suggested based on the images taken from
the HST/ACS (Tasca et al. 2009, section 4), where fspiral ∼
0.4–0.6 in the similar stellar mass limit. Thus, we consider
that our deep learning model can reasonably select spi-
ral galaxies in the corresponding redshift spaces, despite
poorer spatial resolution of the HSC images than that of
the HST data. However, we should still be missing signif-
icant fractions of spiral galaxies, especially at higher red-
shift bins, because the HST-based training and validation
data would be incomplete. We note that this study does
not aim to derive the intrinsic spiral fraction. Rather, we
solely focus on systematic comparisons between the spiral
fraction and the large-scale galaxy overdensity based on a
stacking analysis, by leveraging survey volumes that are
signiﬁcantly larger than those in previous studies at the
similar redshift range.

On top of that, we veriﬁed the precision of the photo-
metric redshift measurement by Mizuki (Tanaka 2015) for
spiral galaxies in the target redshift range z = [0.3 : 0.6).
It is expected that photometric redshift errors of spiral
galaxies would be larger than those of the entire sample
because late-type galaxies tend to be bluer (i.e., less promi-
nent Balmer break features) in the rest-frame optical wave-
length. With this motivation, we utilize 32 939 galaxies

frame u − r colors of spirals in diﬀerent density environ-
ments (§4.2).

4.1 Spiral fractions across large-scale environments

With 74 103 spiral galaxies out of 276 220 stellar-mass lim-
ited samples (Table 1), we estimate the spiral fractions in
diﬀerent overdensities and red sequence clusters from the
archive catalog (Shimakawa et al. 2021; Oguri et al. 2018,
see Section 2.2), at three target redshift bins, z = [0.3 : 0.4),
[0.4 : 0.5), and [0.5 : 0.6). The result is represented in Fig. 9,
where we stacked all sources and spirals given the similar
overdensity ∆σr=10cMpc = 1 across the entire survey ﬁeld to
accumulate the suﬃcient sample size in each bin. The red
diamonds also indicate the spiral fractions in the vicinity
of red sequence clusters selected by the CAMIRA cluster
catalog within the same survey ﬁeld (Oguri et al. 2018) at
the same redshift bin in each panel. Typical overdensities
(σr=10cMpc) of red-sequence clusters in Shimakawa et al.
(2021) are σr=10cMpc = 1.1, 0.9, and 1.1 at z = [0.3 : 0.4),
[0.4 : 0.5), and [0.5 : 0.6), respectively. We selected galaxies
in 2 co-Mpc projected distances from the red sequence clus-
ters. The distance threshold was decided considering that
the excess of red fractions has been detected within <
∼ 2 co-
Mpc around the CAMIRA clusters (Nishizawa et al. 2018,
§5.2). Fig. 9 shows both the spiral fractions from direct
measurements and those with corrections of the complete-
ness and contamination rates given in Fig. 5. The contam-
ination rates within the selected spirals are estimated to
be approximately 5–8 percent.

Owing to the combination of the wide-ﬁeld deep imag-
ing data by HSC-SSP and the deep learning classiﬁcation,
Fig. 9 successfully demonstrates moderate trends of the
large-scale environmental dependence of the spiral fraction
at z = 0.3–0.6 related to lower spiral fractions at higher
overdensities on 10 co-Mpc scale. What is worth noting
is that we ﬁnd a systematic increase of the spiral frac-
tion in lower-density environments at each redshift slice,
which is achievable only with such continuous overdensity
information by our previous work (Shimakawa et al. 2021).
Moreover, we conﬁrmed deﬁcits of the spiral fraction in
the vicinity of red sequence clusters at all three redshift
bins, as reported in previous studies (e.g., Moran et al.
2007; Poggianti et al. 2009 and references therein).

shifts and photometric redshifts (∆z) of the targets (gray) and selected spi-

from our sample with spectroscopic redshifts, out of which
7605 sources are classiﬁed as spirals, to verify the photo-z
accuracy between spirals and the total sample. Their spec-
troscopic redshifts are based on various surveys available
in the HSC-SSP PDR2 (Aihara et al. 2019, §5.4): SDSS
DR12–14 (Alam et al. 2015; Albareti et al. 2017; Abolfathi
et al. 2018), GAMA DR2 (Liske et al. 2015), PRIMUS
(Coil et al. 2011; Cool et al. 2013), VIPERS (Garilli et al.
2014), VVDS (Le F`evre et al. 2013), WiggleZ (Drinkwater
et al. 2010), and zCOSMOS (Lilly et al. 2009).

Spectroscopic redshifts against photo-z for both the en-
tire spec-z references and selected spirals are illustrated in
Fig. 8. The ﬁgure suggests that spiral galaxies would ex-
hibit slightly larger photo-z errors (by a factor of ∼ 1.5)
at each redshift bin, while their redshift distributions are
broadly consistent with each other. Given the adequate
amount of the spiral sample at each redshift bin (N >
15 000; Table 1), this study ignores such a small increase
of the redshift uncertainty hereafter.

4 Large-scale environmental dependence

Based on the result of our deep-learning-based spiral classi-
ﬁcation and the density measurements from the literature
(Shimakawa et al. 2021; Oguri et al. 2018), we investigate
whether or not there is a large-scale morphology–density

code, Mizuki (Tanaka 2015). This is motivated by the
well-known environmental dependence of the red fraction
(e.g., Tanaka et al. 2005; Peng et al. 2010; Alpaslan et al.
2015). In particular, many previous studies have reported
that passive spiral galaxies (so-called anemic spirals; van
den Bergh 1976) are more frequently observed in galaxy
clusters or intermediate overdensities (e.g. Goto et al.
2003a; Boselli and Gavazzi 2006; Blanton and Moustakas
2009; Bamford et al. 2009; Masters et al. 2010 and refer-
ences therein). Similar to those already observed in the
past, there could be a color dependency of spiral galaxies
even on large-scale environments.

The derived rest-frame u−r color distributions of spiral
galaxies as a function of the overdensity are illustrated in
Fig. 10. Dashed lines and red error bars represent 68th
percentiles of spiral galaxies given overdensity and red se-
quence clusters, respectively. We observe bluer color dis-
tributions of spiral galaxies compared to those in the en-
tire sample except the lowest-z sample at z = [0.3 : 0.4).
However, the similar colors between spirals and all sources
at z = [0.3 : 0.4) should be due to a technical issue since
the HSC ﬁlters (grizy) do not fully cover the rest-frame u-
band photometry of galaxies at this redshift range. Over
the redshift range of z = 0.3–0.6, in general, we cannot
determine any signiﬁcant color dependence on the large-
scale over-density given the spiral sample, while there is
a lack of relatively bluer spirals in the highest density bin
and clusters at z = [0.3 : 0.4) (Fig. 10). A possible expla-
nation of a decorrelation between rest-frame u − r colors
of spirals and the galaxy overdensities is described in the
discussion section (§5). On the other hand, median u − r
colors of spirals in the vicinity of red sequence clusters are

slightly redder than those in the other ﬁelds at z = [0.4 : 0.5)
and z = [0.5 : 0.6), which broadly agrees with the observa-
tional trends reported in the previous work (Goto et al.
2004; Wolf et al. 2007; Bamford et al. 2009; Cantale et al.
2016).

5 Discussion

We discuss and attempt to interpret the results obtained in
the last section. Based on the stacking analysis, we deter-
mined a statistical trend in which the spiral fraction tends
to increase (or decrease) in lower (or higher) densities at
z = 0.3–0.6 on ten co-Mpc scales. This suggests a bias
on the global scale across the large-scale structure of the
universe, which could originate from a diﬀerence in mass
assembly histories in the underlying density environments
of the large-scale structure. In fact, it is plausible that the
known morphology–density relation in and around mas-
sive clusters can be validated even on such a wide scale,
because large-scale overdensities tend to be associated with
larger numbers of clusters, as demonstrated in the study
by Shimakawa et al. (2021).

Moderate environmental dependence of galaxy mor-
phology on the large-scale will lead to a non-negligible cos-
mic variance in the measurement of the spiral fraction if
research does not use the data covering suﬃciently large
areas. For testing such a cosmic variance eﬀect, we in-
vestigate the variation of the spiral fraction in individual
ﬁelds given survey areas at each redshift bin. Fig. 11 rep-
resents the variance of the spiral fractions (fspiral) within
1 and 27 deg2 based on 1000 random points in our sur-
vey ﬁeld, where 27 deg2 corresponds to the footprint of

black open circles and red open triangles are massive galaxies and spirals nearby red sequence clusters (Oguri et al. 2018). The error bars indicate 68th
percentile regions. We note that the similar color distributions of spirals to the entire sample at z = 0.3–0.4 should be due to the measurement error because
their rest-frame u-band ﬂuxes are not fully covered by the HSC grizy ﬁlters.

the HSC-SSP DUD layer. The ﬁgure suggests a signiﬁcant
cosmic variance in the derivation of the spiral fraction in 1
deg2. However, measurement errors due to the small sam-
ple size (N = 182, 341, and 457 per deg2 on average at
z = [0.3 : 0.4), [0.4 : 0.5), and [0.5 : 0.6)) would contribute
to some increase of the variance. Even if the survey area
reaches 27 deg2, there are small variations of ±0.02 to
0.04 depending on the redshift. The signiﬁcant variabil-
ity also cautions that, when we study morphology–density
dependence on the local scale, we may need to take care
of the underlying large-scale structure of the target region.
Such comprehensive work requires an expensive spectro-
scopic survey with extremely wide-ﬁeld coverage, such as
DESI (DESI Collaboration et al. 2016), PFS (Takada et
al. 2014; Tamura et al. 2016), and 4MOST (de Jong et al.
2012; de Jong et al. 2019). These programs will allow us
to unveil a systematic bias of the spiral fraction in various
environments on a large scale as well as the local scale.

Next, selected spiral objects do not exhibit a clear
environmental dependence on the rest-frame u − r color.
Previous studies have reported that galaxy clusters and/or
groups tend to have a higher fraction of red spirals (Goto
et al. 2003b; Wolf et al. 2007; Bamford et al. 2009; Masters
et al. 2010), thus suggesting a transition of spiral galaxies
falling into massive halos to S0 galaxies, as observed in
today’s massive clusters (Goto et al. 2004; Moran et al.
2007; Kovaˇc et al. 2010). We reconﬁrm such a systematic
color trend in the vicinity of red sequence clusters in our
sample. However, regarding large-scale environments (10
co-Mpc in our case), such a physical transition occurring
on the local scale (∼ a physical Mpc) becomes negligible,
which might explain the absence of a signiﬁcant trend in

this study.

We should stress that the current spiral classiﬁcation is
highly limited to bright and massive objects with a lim-
iting stellar mass of 5 × 1010 M(cid:12). Also, we would miss a
non-negligible fraction of spiral galaxies owing to the reso-
lution limit (0.7 arcsec in seeing FWHM), though we used
the HST-based morphological information as classiﬁcation
ﬂags by Willett et al. (2017). Such a selection bias is a
major challenge that needs to be addressed in the future,
as stated at the end.

6 Conclusions

Lastly, we summarize the ﬂow of this paper. We inves-
tigated the spiral fraction of mass-limited galaxies based
on the sample in the signiﬁcant volumes obtained from
the HSC-SSP PDR2. This study attempted to elucidate
the global-scale environmental dependence that may orig-
inate from the varying growth of underlying density envi-
ronments for the large-scale structure rather than physi-
cal interactions between galaxies and clusters occurring on
the local scale. Previous studies, such as the SED ﬁtting
(Tanaka et al. 2018), projected density map (Shimakawa
et al. 2021), and red sequence cluster search (Oguri et al.
2018) based on HSC-SSP, enabled us to achieve such an ob-
jective. Consequently, we obtained 276 220 massive galax-
ies across 360 deg2, parts of which are associated with 1136
red sequence clusters at the corresponding redshift range.
A total of 74 103 galaxies were labeled as spiral galaxies
via transfer learning based on a pre-trained deep CNN. The
obtained results indicate the moderate large-scale environ-
mental dependence of the spiral fraction at z = 0.3–0.6.
Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious trend of the
rest-frame u − r colors for the spiral galaxies towards the
overdensity. These results suggest a large-scale environ-
mental dependence of galaxy morphology at least up to
z = 0.6, while observed color transitions of spiral galax-
ies falling into galaxy clusters and groups are no longer
detected on such a wide scale.

Although the current analysis is limited by the photo-z
uncertainty and high stellar mass (> 5×1010 M(cid:12)), ongoing
and upcoming intensive programs will resolve these limita-
tions. For instance, DESI (DESI Collaboration et al. 2016)
will address more than a thousand spectroscopic data per
square degree for emission-line galaxies at intermediate
redshift (z <
∼ 1.3) over 14k deg2. Other forthcoming spec-
troscopic surveys such as PFS (Takada et al. 2014; Tamura
et al. 2016), MOONS (Cirasuolo et al. 2011; Cirasuolo et
al. 2014), and 4MOST (de Jong et al. 2012; de Jong et
al. 2019) will also facilitate the accumulation of more de-

resolution imaging by the Roman Space Telescope (Spergel
et al. 2015; Akeson et al. 2019) will provide a clear path for
the morphology classiﬁcation in the distant universe, which
can considerably extend the sample size towards lower stel-
lar mass and higher redshift from this study.
