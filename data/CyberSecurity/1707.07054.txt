ABSTRACT
Infrastructure networks are vulnerable to both cyber and physical
attacks. Building a secure and resilient networked system is es-
sential for providing reliable and dependable services. To this end,
we establish a two-player three-stage game framework to capture
the dynamics in the infrastructure protection and recovery phases.
Specifically, the goal of the infrastructure network designer is to
keep the network connected before and after the attack, while the
adversary aims to disconnect the network by compromising a set of
links. With costs for creating and removing links, the two players
aim to maximize their utilities while minimizing the costs. In this
paper, we use the concept of subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) to
characterize the optimal strategies of the network defender and at-
tacker. We derive the SPE explicitly in terms of system parameters.
Finally, we use a case study of UAV-enabled communication net-
works for disaster recovery to corroborate the obtained analytical
results.

1 INTRODUCTION
Infrastructure networks are increasingly connected due to the in-
tegration of the information and communications technologies
(ICTs). For example, the introduction of smart meters has enabled
the communications between the users and the utility companies.
Communications with roadside units in vehicular networks can
provide safety warnings and traffic information.

However, infrastructure networks are vulnerable to not only
physical attacks (e.g., terrorism, theft or vandalisms) but also cyber
attacks. These attacks can damage the connectivity of the infras-
tructure system and thus results in the performance degradation
and operational dysfunction. For instance, an adversary can attack
the road sensor units and create traffic congestion [1]. As a result,
the transportation system can break down due to the loss of roads.
An adversary can also launch denial-of-service attacks to discon-
nect communication networks [2], resulting in inaccessibility of
relevant database for air travel or financial transactions.

The cyber-physical nature of the infrastructure can also enable
the coordinated attacks on the infrastructure systems that allow an
adversary to use both cyber and physical approaches to disconnect
networks. Therefore, infrastructure protection plays a significant
role to maintain the connectivity of the infrastructure networks.
One way to protect the network is to create redundant links in the
network so that networks can be still connected despite arbitrary
removal of links. This approach has been used in traffic networks
by creating multiple modes of transportation, in communication
networks by adding extra wired or wireless links, and in supply
chain networks by making orders from multiple suppliers.

Adding link redundancy is an effective approach when there is no
knowledge of the target of the attacker, and thus the objective of the
network designer is to secure the network by making the network
robust to arbitrary removal of a fixed number of links. However, it
becomes expensive and sometimes prohibitive when the cost for
creating links is costly, and the attacker is powerful. Therefore, a
paradigm shift to emphasize the recovery and response to attacks
is critical, and the infrastructure resilience becomes essential for
developing post-attack mechanisms to mitigate the impacts. With a
limited budget of resources, it is essential to develop an optimal post-
attack healing mechanism as well as a pre-attack secure mechanism
holistically and understand the fundamental tradeoffs between
security and resilience in the infrastructures.

To this end, we establish a two-player dynamic three-stage net-
work game formation problem in which the infrastructure network
designer aims to keep the network connected before and after the
attack, while the objective of the adversary is to keep the network
disconnected after the attack. Note that each player has a cost on
creating or removing links. Specifically, at the first stage of the
game, the infrastructure network designer first creates a network
with necessary redundancies by anticipating the impact of adver-
sarial behavior. Then, an adversary attacks at the second stage by
removing a minimum number of links of the network. At the last
stage of the game, the network designer can recover the network
after the attack by adding extra links to the attacked network.

The resilience of the network is characterized by the capability
of the network to maintain connectivity after the attack and the
time it takes to heal the network. The security of the infrastructure
is characterized by the capability of the network to withstand the
attack before healing. Adding a large number of redundancies to
the network can prevent the attack from disconnecting the network,
but this approach can be costly. Hence, it is important to make
strategic decisions and planning to yield a protection and recovery
mechanism for the infrastructure with a minimum cost.

We adopt subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE) as the solution
concept of the dynamic game. We observe that with sufficient
capabilities of recovery, the infrastructure can mitigate the threats
by reducing the incentives of the attackers. We analyze SPE of the
game by investigating two different parameter regimes. Further, we
develop an optimal post-attack network healing strategy to recover
the infrastructure network. When an attacker is powerful (attack
cost is low), we observe that the defender needs to allocate more
resources in securing the network to reduce the incentives of the
attacker. In addition, agile resilience and fast response to attacks
are critical in mitigating the cyber threats in the infrastructures.

Related Works: Security is a critical concern for infrastructure
networks [3, 4]. The method in our work is relevant to the recent

 
 
 
 
 
 
advances in adversarial networks [5, 6] and network formation
games [7, 8]. In particular, we jointly design the optimal protection
and recovery strategies for infrastructure networks.

Organization of the Paper: The rest of the paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 formulates the problem. Dynamic game analysis
are presented in Section 3. Section 4 derives the SPE of the dynamic
game. Case studies are given in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes
the paper.

2 DYNAMIC GAME FORMULATION
In this section, we consider an infrastructure system represented
by a set N of n nodes. The infrastructure designer can design a
network with redundant links before the attack for protection and
adding new links after the attack for recovery. The sequence of
the actions taken by the designer and the attacker is described as
follows:

• A Designer (D) aims to create a network between these

nodes and protect it against a malicious attack;

• After some time of operation, an Adversary (A) puts an
attack on the network by removing a subset of its links;
• Once the D realizes that an attack has been conducted, it
has the opportunity to heal its network by constructing
new links (or reconstructing some destroyed ones).
In addition, the timing of the actions also play a significant role in
determining the optimal strategies of both players. We normalize
the horizon of the event from the start of the preparation of infras-
tructure protection to a time point of interest as the time internal
[0, 1]. This normalization is motivated by the observation made in
[9] where the consequences of fifteen major storms occurring be-
tween 2004 and 2012 are plotted over a normalized duration of the
event. We let τ and τR represent, respectively, the fraction of time
spent before the attack (system is fully operational) and between
the attack and the healing phase. This is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Attack and Defense Time Fractions.

The goal of the designer or the defender is to create protection
and recovery mechanisms to keep its network operational, i.e.,
connected in this case. Let E1 be the set of links created by the
defender initially (i.e. at time 0). EA ⊆ E1 is the set of links removed
(attacked) by the adversary and E2 is the set of links created by the
defender after the attack (at fraction τ + τR of the time horizon).
Regardless of the time stamp, creating (resp. removing) links has
a unitary cost cD (resp. cA). The adversary aims to disconnect the
network. Thus, for any set E, we define 1E which equals 1 if the
graph (N, E) is connected and 0 otherwise. Values τ , τR , cA and cD
are common knowledge to both the Designer and the Adversary.
As a tie-breaker rule, assume that if the output is the same for the
Adversary, the Adversary chooses to attack the network with the

strongest number of link removals. Similarly, the Designer chooses
not to create links if its utility is the same.

Therefore, the utility for the designer (resp. adversary) is equal to
the fraction of time the network is connected (resp. disconnected)
minus the costs of creating (resp. removing) the links. Hence the
payoff functions of the designer and the adversary are represented
by UD and UA, respectively, as follows:

UD (E1, E2, EA) =(1 − τ − τR )1E1\EA∪E2

+ τ 1E1

− cD (|E1| + |E2|),
UA(E1, E2, EA) =(1 − τ − τR )(1 − 1E1\EA∪E2 ) − cA |EA |
+τ (1 − 1E1 ) + τR (1 − 1E1\EA
),

+τR 1E1\EA

where | · | denotes the cardinality of a set.

As the players are strategic, we study the SPE and analyze the
strategies of the players to the sets (E1, EA, E2). Thus, we seek
triplets (E1, EA, E2) such that E2 is a best response to (E1, EA)
and that given E1, (EA, E2) is also a SPE. In other words, the SPE
involves the analysis of the following three sequentially nested
problems starting from the last stage of the designer’s recovery
problem to the first stage of the designer’s protection problem:
(i) Given the strategies E1 and EA, player D chooses

E∗
2 (E1, EA) ∈ arg maxE2 UD (E1, EA, E2);

(ii) Given E1, the adversary chooses

E∗

(E1) ∈ arg maxEA

(iii) Player D chooses

UA(E1, EA, E∗

2 (E1, EA));

1 ∈ arg maxE1 UD (E1, E∗

(E1), E∗

2 (E1, EA)).

The equilibrium solution (E1, EA, E2) that solves the above three
problems consistently is an SPE of the two-player dynamic game.

3 GAME ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyze the possible configurations of the infras-
tructure network at SPE.

We first note that cA should be not too large, since otherwise A
cannot be a threat to D. Similarly, cD should be sufficiently small
so that the D can create a connected network:

Lemma 3.1. If cA > 1 − τ , then A has no incentive to attack any
1
n−1 , then D has no incentive to create a connected

link. If cD >
network.

Proof. Suppose that cA > 1 − τ . Let E1 be given and B :=
τ (1 − 1E1 ). If A decides not to remove any link, then its payoff is
B + τR (1 − 1E1 ) + (1 − τ − τR )(1 − 1E1∪E2 ) ≥ B. Otherwise, |EA | ≥ 1
and UA(E1, E2, EA) ≤ B + (1 −τ −τR )(1 − 1E1\EA∪E2 ) −cA +τR (1 −
) ≤ B +1−τ −cA < B. Thus, it is a best response for A to play
1E1\EA
1
n−1 , then if D plays E1 = E2 = ∅, its
EA = ∅. Similarly, if cD >
utility is 0. Otherwise, its utility is bounded above by 1 − (n − 1)cD
which corresponds to a connected tree network with the minimum
(cid:3)
number of links.

In the following, we thus suppose that cA < 1 − τ and cD <
Note that the SPE can correspond only to a set of situations:

n−1 .

Lemma 3.2. Suppose that (E1, EA, E2) is an SPE. Then, we are

necessarily in one of the situations given in Table 1.

Proof. Altogether, 8 situations should be possible. However,

The shape of the SPE depends on the values of the parameters of
the game. In particular, it depends on whether the D has incentive
to fully reconstruct (heal) the system after an attack of the A. More
precisely, if 1 − τ − τR > (n − 1)cD , then the D prefers to heal the
network even if all links have been compromised by the attacker.
Otherwise, there should be a minimum number of links remained
after the attack for the D to heal the network at the SPE. We analyze
these two cases in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.

4 SPE ANALYSIS OF THE GAME
Depending on the parameters, we derive SPE of the game in two
regimes: 1 − τ − τR > (n − 1)cD and the otherwise.

4.1 Regime 1: 1 − τ − τR > (n − 1)cD
In the case where 1 − τ − τR > (n − 1)cD , the network always
recovers to be connected after the attack. The potential SPE can
occur in only three of the Situations in Table 1. More precisely:

Proof. First note that any connected network contains at least
n − 1 links. Conversely, any set of nodes can be made connected
by using exactly n − 1 links (any spanning tree is a solution). We
= 0. Then, either D decides not
consider a situation where 1E1\EA
to heal the network and receives a utility of U ∗ = τ 1E1 − cD |E1|,
or it decides to heal it (by using at most n − 1 links) and receives
a utility of at least U = (1 − τ − τR ) + τ 1E1 − cD (|E1| + n − 1).
The difference is U − U ∗ = (1 − τ − τR ) − cD (n − 1) > 0. Thus, D
always prefers to heal the network after the attack of A. Therefore,
Situations 3 and 5 contain no SPE.

Next we consider Situation 4. Since 1E1\EA∪E2

= 1, then D needs
to create in total at least n − 1 links: |E1| + |E2| ≥ n − 1. Therefore,
an optimal strategy is E1 = ∅ and |E2| = n − 1. Since E1 = ∅, the
optimal strategy of A is EA = ∅.

In Situation 2, (N, E1) is connected, and thus |E1| ≥ n − 1.
Further, 1E1 = 1 and 1E1\EA
= 0, and thus |EA | ≥ 1. Since 1 − τ −
τR > (n − 1)cD , then A should remove the minimum number of
links to disconnect the network, and we obtain the result.

Finally, in Situation 1, since 1E1\EA

= 1, then D does not need to
create any link during the healing phase: E2 = ∅. Since 1 −τ −τR >
links if and only if it obtains
(n − 1)cD , then A attacks at most kR

cD

4.2 Regime 2: 1 − τ − τR < (n − 1)cD
We now consider the case where D has incentive, at phase τ + τR ,
to heal the network if at most k links are required to reconnect it,
where k = (cid:106) 1−τ −τR

< n − 1.

(cid:107)

We study the potential SPE in Situations 3, 4 and 5 in Lemma 4.3,

Situation 2 in Lemma 4.4, and Situation 1 in Lemma 4.5.

Lemma 4.3. If 1−τ −τR < (n −1)cD , we have the following results:
• Any SPE in Situation 3 satisfies E2 = ∅, |EA | = k + 1 and
|E1| = n − 1, leading to utilities UD = τ − (n − 1)cD and
UA = 1 − τ − (k + 1)cA (occurs only if (cid:98) 1−τ
cA

• There exists no SPE in Situation 4;
• The only potential SPE in Situation 5 is the null strategy:
E1 = E2 = EA = ∅, leading to utilities UD = 0 and UA = 1.

(cid:99) > k);

Proof. Suppose that an SPE occurs in Situation 5. Since the
network is always disconnected, then UD = −cD (|E1| + |E2|). The
maximum utility is obtained when E1 = E2 = ∅. Thus, EA = ∅.

In Situation 4, since any connected network contains at least
n − 1 links, then the maximum utility of D is UD (E1, E2, EA) =
(1 −τ −τR ) −cD (n − 1) < 0. Thus, D is better off with a null strategy
(occurring in Situation 5).

In Situation 3, since 1E1 = 1 then |E1| ≥ n − 1. D can achieves
(cid:44)
utility value τ −(n −1)cD by playing a tree network. Since 1E1\EA
1E1 then |EA | ≥ 1 and UA ≤ 1 − τ − cA. The bound is achieved by
attacking any one link created by D. We further can show that A
needs to attack k +1 links such that D will not heal the network. (cid:3)

In the following, we focus on the SPEs in Situations 1 and 2. In
both cases, 1E1 = 1. Thus, D creates initially a connected network.
For each node i ∈ N , let di be its degree. The potential best response
strategies of A to E1 are summarized as follows:

= 0;
(i) Either A does not attack and obtains a utility of U
(ii) Or A attacks sufficiently many links so that the network
admits 2 components, i.e., A attacks exactly min1≤i ≤n di
links to disconnect a node of minimal degree. Then, D
heals the network by constructing 1 link, and A receives

(min1≤i ≤n di ). Since at τ + τR , D can create at most k − α links,
then the goal of A in case (iii) is to create at least (cid:96) = k − α + 2
components in the network (that is, to create a k −α + 1 cut). Hence,
D constructs E1 in a way that at least kA +(min1≤i ≤n di ) links need
to be removed so that the network consists of k + 2 − α components.
(cid:109). Suppose that
k < kA (i.e. k ≤ kA − 1). Then, for any E1, consider the following
attack: first remove α links so that the resulting network is a tree
and then remove k2 + 1 − α links. Then, the resulting network has
exactly n − 2 −k +α links, that is, it has n − (n − 2 −k +α) = k −α + 2
components and is obtained using k + 1 < kA + (min1≤i ≤n di ) links.
Thus, if k < kA, no SPE in Situation 2 exists.

We denote k := (cid:106) 1−τ −τR

(cid:107) and kA := (cid:108) 1−τ −τR

If k > kA + 1 (i.e. k ≥ kA), then we consider the strategy that
consists for D to create a line network at time 0. Then to create
k + 2 components, A would need to remove k + 1 links. However,
due to k > kA + 1, it is not a best response for A. The best response
for A is to attack exactly one link (one being adjacent to one of the
nodes with degree 1). Then, the best strategy for D is to recreate
this compromised link at time τ + τR which is an SPE. It is strategic
as it minimizes the number of created links. All other SPEs, i.e.,
trees created at time 0 and choices of the link to remove and the
(cid:3)
one to heal, yield the same payoffs for both players.

Proof. At an SPE in Situation 2, the utility of D is of the form

1 − τR − cD (|E1| + |E2|). It is a best strategy if:

If 1 < δcD or if 1 − τ < (δ − n + 1)cD , no SPE in Situation 1 exists.
Otherwise, the unique SPE is such that UD = 1 − δcD and UA = 0.

• It is the best strategy of D to heal the network at time
τ + τR , i.e., 1 − τR − (|E1| + |E2|)cD ≥ τ − |E1|cD . Thus,
(cid:107) := k, and k is the maximum number of
|E2| ≤
links that D can create at time τ + τR at an SPE.

Therefore, we obtain |E1| ≤

obtain 1 − τ ≥ (|E1| − (n − 1))cD . Since 1 − τ − τR < (n − 1)cD , then
1 − τ ≥ (|E1| − (n − 1))cD + 1 − τ − τR − (n − 1)cD , that is

τR ≥ (|E1| − 2(n − 1))cD .

5 CASE STUDIES
In this section, we use a case study of UAV-enabled communication
networks to corroborate the obtained results. UAVs become an
emerging technology to serve as communication relays, especially
in disaster recovery scenarios in which the existing communica-
tion infrastructures are out of service [11]. In the following, we
consider a team of n = 10 UAVs. The unitary costs of creating
and compromising a communication link between UAVs for the
operator/defender and adversary are cD = 1/20 and cA = 1/8,
respectively. When the adversary attacks the network at phase
τ = 0.3, and the defender heals it after τR = 0.2, the UAV-enabled
communication network configuration at SPE is shown in Fig. 2
which admits a tree structure, and A does not attack the network at
SPE. In addition, the utilities for D and A at SPE with τR ∈ [0, 0.6]
are shown in Fig. 3. The SPE encounters switching with different
τR . As τR increases, the UAV network operator needs to allocate
more link resources to secure the network. Otherwise, the attacker
has an incentive to compromise the communication links with a
positive payoff. Specifically, when τR < 0.375, A does not attack
the UAV network, and D obtains a positive utility by constructing a
securely connected network. When 0.375 < τR < 0.5, the defender
creates a connected network with the minimum effort, i.e., 9 links,
at phase 0. In this interval, the attacker will successfully compro-
mise the system during phase [τ , τ + τR ], and the defender heals
the network afterward. When τR exceeds 0.5, the defender does
not either protect or heal the network. The reason is that larger τR
provides more incentives for the attacker to compromise the links
and receive a better payoff. This also indicates that agile resilience
(small τR ) is critical in mitigating cyber threats in the infrastructure
networks.

6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have established a two-player three-stage dynamic
game for the infrastructure network protection and recovery. We
have characterized the strategic strategies of the network defender

and the attacker by analyzing the subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE)
of the game. With a case study on UAV-enabled communication
networks for disaster recovery, we have observed that with an agile
response to the attack, the defender can obtain a positive utility by
creating a securely connected infrastructure network. Furthermore,
a higher level resilience saves link resources for the defender and
yields a better payoff. In addition, a longer duration between the
attack and recovery phases induces a higher level of cyber threats
to the infrastructures. Future work would include the extension of
the network formation problem to interdependent networks and
dynamic games with incomplete information.
