Abstract 

Mobile  banking  applications  have  gained  popularity  and  have  significantly  revolutionised  the 
banking industry. Despite the convenience offered by M-Banking Apps, users are often distrustful 
of the security of the applications due to an increasing trend of cyber security compromises, cyber-
attacks, and data breaches. Considering the upsurge in cyber security vulnerabilities of M-Banking 
Apps and the paucity of research in this domain, this study was conducted to empirically measure 
user-perceived security of M-Banking Apps. A total of 315 responses from study participants were 
analysed using covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). The results indicated 
that  most  constructs  of  the  baseline  Extended  Unified  Theory  of  Acceptance  and  Use  of 
Technology  (UTAUT2)  structure  were  validated.  Perceived  security,  institutional  trust  and 
technology trust were confirmed as factors that affect user’s intention to adopt and use M-Banking 
Apps.  However, perceived risk was not confirmed as a significant predictor. The current study 
further  revealed  that  in  the  context  of  M-Banking  Apps,  the  effects  of  security  and  trust  are 
complex.  The  impact  of  perceived  security  and  institutional  trust  on behavioural  intention  was 
moderated by age,  gender,  experience,  income, and education, while  perceived security on use 
behaviour  was  moderated  by  age,  gender,  and  experience.  The  effect  of  technology  trust  on 
behavioural  intention  was  moderated  by  age,  education,  and  experience.  Overall,  the  proposed 
conceptual  model  achieved  acceptable  fit  and  explained  79%  of  the  variance  in  behavioural 
intention and 54.7% in use behaviour of M-Banking Apps, higher than that obtained in the original 
UTAUT2. The guarantee of enhanced security, advanced privacy mechanisms and trust should be 
considered paramount in future strategies aimed at promoting M-Banking Apps adoption and use.

1. Introduction 

The growth in technological innovation, the increasing need for up-to-date information and the 
requirement  for  information  systems  that  are  convenient  have  significant  importance  in  the 
banking industry and the financial sector as a whole (Majumdar & Pujari, 2021). Many banks, 
both traditional (e.g. Barclays, HSBC, Santander, NatWest etc.) and modern digital banks (e.g. 
Monzo,  Monese,  Starling  etc.)  have  deployed  mobile  banking  applications  (“M-Banking 
Apps”) to reduce operational and managerial cost while providing improvement in customer 
services and satisfaction. 

The introduction of mobile banking has necessitated a rapid increase and popularity of mobile 
financial web apps (Singh and Srivastava, 2020; Shareef et al., 2018), which to a large extent 
offer many advantages to bank entities in terms of ease and comfort of performing transaction 
by  clients,  improving  service  quality  as  well  as  increasing  market  coverage  (Rabaa’I  & 
AlMaati, 2021; Namahoot & Laohavichien, 2018).  

Mobile devices have become an integral part of our daily lives. Given the prevalence of mobile 
devices, M-Banking and online channels have become the preferred medium for users to access 
their banking services ( To & Trinh, 2021). As mobile devices become more versatile, they 
play  a  key  role  in  the  interaction  between  users  and  financial  services  providers.

Notwithstanding the prevalence of mobile devices in recent times, there are inherent risk and 
security vulnerabilities which could be exploited. The popularity of these devices has seen a 
corresponding increase in the appetite of cybercriminals and computer hackers to target such 
devices (Amro and Tiantian, 2017). Therefore, despite the convenience offered by M-Banking 
Apps,  users  could  be  distrustful  of  the  security  of  the  application  (Ramli  et  al.,  2021),  and 
ultimately may want to stay with traditional banking services and methods.  

Financial transactions through M-Banking Apps are characterised by uncertainty, anonymity 
and  often  without  human  contact  or  inter-personal  relationship.  This  in  itself  creates 
circumstances of security threats to the user, thereby justifying their mistrust of M-Banking 
security within the virtual environment (Mettouris et al., 2015). For online users, security is a 
highly rated issue in their trust of mobile financial services (Kumar & Yukita, 2021). This is 
because users provide their banking details and other personal information while performing 
online financial transactions. The perception of security and risks of M-Banking Apps is a key 
aspect of the usage of the channel for mobile and online financial transactions. Many studies 
have been conducted to examine users perception of trust, risk and security of online banking, 
mobile banking and internet banking in general (Obaid, 2021; Kumar & Yukita, 2021; Merhi 
et al., 2021; Merhi et al., 2019; Mutahar et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2019). These studies have 
offered varied outcomes and analysis pertaining to the security threats of M-Banking.  

Although issues of trust, security and risk of mobile banking have been extensively studied, 
particularly  in  developed  countries,  they  failed  to  examine  how  individual  differences  and 
characteristics moderate the effects of perceived security, risk, and trust. While users of M-
Banking  Apps  may  become  increasingly  concerned  about  the  safety  and  security  of  their 
transactions  and  data  protection,  the  perception  may  differ  among  various  demographics 
(Chawla  and  Joshi,  2018;  Choudrie,  Junior,  McKenna,  and  Richter,  2018).  For  instance,  
Natarajan  et  al.  (2018)  have  indicated  that,  intention  to  use  electronic  banking  is  more 
applicable to females than males and that older people harbour more trust towards electronic 
banking  services  than  younger  generations.  There  is  a  dearth  of  research  examining  the 
characteristics of age, gender, income, experience, and education level on the antecedents of 
security,  risk,  and  trust.  In  many  cases  however,  the  moderating  effects  of  demographic 
characteristics on the security perception of M-Banking Apps users are anecdotal rather than 
empirical. More importantly, different personality and geographic characteristics can impact 
security perceptions culminating into low adoption rate for M-Banking Apps. 

Against this background, the key objective of this research is to measure how characteristics 
such  as  age,  gender,  education,  income,  and  experience  moderate  the  effect  of  perceived 
security on M-Banking  Apps. Although the UTAUT and UTAUT2 as  well as other studies 
(such as Bapista & Oliveira, 2015) examined how some characteristics moderate the effect of 
certain  antecedents  on  adoption,  how  these  characteristics  moderate  the  effect  of  perceived 
security have not been investigated within the context of M-Banking Apps. Liébana-Cabanillas 
et  al.  (2014)  found  that  user  behavior  differ  across  mobile  payment  platforms,  hence  it  is 
possible that perceptions of security on M-Banking Apps may not replicate in other systems 
(Ramli et al., 2021; To & Trinh, 2021). 

The present study is an effort to fill the gap in literature by addressing the shortcomings that 
have been identified. The outcome of this study will make significant theoretical and practical 
contributions.  From  a  theoretical  perspective,  this  study  contributes  to  extant  technology 
adoption  literature  as  recommended  by  Venkatesh  et  al.,  (2012)  through  the  expansion  of 
extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model beyond the 

2 

 
 
 
 
initial  context  for  which  it  were  conceived.  As  such,  this  study  integrates  four  constructs, 
security,  risk,  institutional  trust,  and  technology  trust  into  the  UTAUT2  with  the  aim  of 
expanding  the  generalisability  and  the  applicability  of  the  theory  in  the  M-Banking  Apps 
context. This study is the first attempt at examining how demographic characteristics such as 
age, gender, income, education, and experience moderate perceived security in the context of 
M-Banking Apps. Again, while many of the existing study have examined trust in the broader 
perspective, this study departs from such studies and delineate trust into institutional trust and 
technology trust. Since trust is important determinant of online purchases and transactions, it 
is important to distinguish users trust in the internet medium (technology trust) and trust of 
banking  institutions  (institutional  trust).  The  outcome  of  the  study  will  facilitate  the 
formulation  of  strategies  aimed  at  ensuring  the  successful  security  implementation  apps 
developers and also offer policy makers in the banking industry the opportunity to empirically 
examine consumers security concerns and put in place the required mitigating mechanisms. 

The  rest  of  this  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  Two  presents  the  literature  review 
comprising  related  works,  theoretical  framework,  conceptual  model  for  the  study  and 
hypothesis formulation, this is followed by the study methodology adopted in Section Three. 
Section Four present detailed discussion on the statistical analysis, results, and findings. The 
paper  concludes  with  Section  Five,  giving  elaboration  on  the  study’s  main  findings, 
conclusions, main contribution of the study as well as limitations and future research directions. 

2. Literature Review  

2.1. Related Works 

Users perception of security is one of the main factors affecting many electronic applications 
including e-commerce, mobile banking, internet banking, online shopping among many other 
systems (Merhi et al., 2021). As human errors in online transactions are inevitable (Karjaluoto 
et al., 2021), several factors also come to play to compromise the mobile banking security as 
technological vulnerabilities (eg. cyber security threats) continue to be major concerns for M-
Banking App deployment (Rehman & Shaikh, 2020; Prabhakaran et al., 2020). These concerns 
exist despite the advances in technology protection and security (Win et al., 2021; Tham et al., 
2017). Lack of information on M-Banking security has contributed to users’ lack of awareness 
about security which has further heightened their perception of security and lack of trust in M-
Banking services  Obaid, 2021; Majumdar & Pujari, 2021). Notwithstanding the advances in 
internet and security technology, the fact that users do not have adequate information on M-
Banking security measures have affected their appreciation of such systems (Mutahar et al., 
2018; Stewart & Jürjens, 2018). Security and trust are considered multidimensional factors that 
are  constantly  changing  as  banking  transactions  continue  to  rapidly  shift  from  the  physical 
world to the virtual world. Due to this, perceived security, perceived risk and trust have become 
the main antecedents of consumer acceptance and use of M-Banking Apps (Apau & Koranteng, 
2019). Several studies have examined antecedents of security, trust, and risk of M-Banking. 

In one of the earliest studies into the subject, Chen (2013) carried out an empirical investigation 
into  perceived  risk,  usage  frequency  and  brand  awareness  of  mobile  banking  services.  The 
study  concluded  that  individuals’  behavioural  intention  to  use  mobile  banking  services  is 
influenced by risk perception. Svilar and Zupančič (2016) also found that perceived security is 
the most important factor in mobile and internet banking services. Muñoz-Leiva et al (2017) 
investigated the determinants to use mobile banking apps. The study suggested that trust affects 
user attitude and their perceived risk towards M-Banking Apps. However, perceived risk did 

3 

 
 
 
 
not affect their intention to use mobile banking applications. Similarly, Tham et al., (2017) and 
Pentina et al. (2016) revealed that users’ perceived security and trust influence online banking 
adoption intention. Williams (2018) investigated payment and security perceptions of social 
commerce and mobile payment platforms. Williams’ findings show that trust affects perceived 
risk. However, neither trust nor perceived risk had a significant effect on behavioural intention 
to use mobile payment platforms. In a related study, Stewart and Jürjens (2018) indicated that 
security affects trust and use intention of financial technologies.  

Many other studies have empirically confirmed the effect of security (Rahi and Abd. Ghani, 
2018;  Lim  et  al.,  2019;  Singh  &  Srivastava,  2020),  risk  perception  (Namahoot  and 
Laohavichien,  2018;  Shaw  &  Sergueeva,  2019;  Alonso-Dos-Santos  et  al.,  2020)  and  trust 
(Chauhan et al., 2021; Merhi et al., 2019; Alonso-Dos-Santos et al., 2020; Widodo et al.. 2019) 
on the adoption and use of mobile banking services. More recently, Hanif and Lallie (2021) 
conducted an empirical study examining security factors on the intention to use mobile banking 
applications  in  the  UK  older  generation  (55+).  Hanif  and  Lallie  found  that  perceived 
cybersecurity risk influence intention to use mobile banking apps, but perceived cyber security 
trust and overall security had no effects on intention to use mobile banking apps among UK’s 
older population.  Chauhan et  al  (2021) also  examined the effect  of security and risk on the 
adoption of electronic banking services in India. The study results showed that security risk 
play important role in user intention to adopt and use electronic banking services.  

In  addition  to  security,  risk,  and  trust,  individual  characteristics  have  been  found  to  be 
important in mobile banking applications. While Arenas-Gaitán et al (2015) argued that gender 
plays no role in technology acceptance, other studies (Wang et al., 2016; Chawla and Joshi, 
2018) have considered gender as an important variable in terms of mobile banking adoption. 
Also  age,  experience,  income  and  educational  have  separately  been  identified  in  studies 
(Liébana-Cabanillas  et  al, 2014;  Baptista &  Oliveira, 2015; Laukkanen,  2015)  as important 
influencers of technology adoption. In a recent study, Merhi et al (2021) improved upon an 
earlier  research  work  by  Merhi  et  al  (2019)  by  integrating  age  and  gender  as  a  moderating 
characteristic of security on behavioural intention to use mobile banking apps. The study found 
that age moderates trust among UK consumers, but gender had no significant relationship with 
security, trust and privacy. User behavior differ across mobile payment platforms (Majumdar 
& Pujari, 2021; Widyanto et al., 2020; Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2014), hence it is possible 
that perceptions of security on M-Banking Apps may not replicate in other systems. Although 
the UTAUT and UTAUT2 as well as other studies (e.g., Bapista & Oliveira, 2015) examined 
how some characteristics moderate the effect of certain antecedents on adoption, how these 
characteristics  moderate  the  effect  of  perceived  security,  perceived  trust  (institution  and 
technology) and risk have not been investigated within the context of M-Banking Apps. 

2.2 Theoretical Framework 

Several factors that influence user decision to adopt and use technology have been proposed in 
the academic literature. These have resulted in the proposition and development of theories on 
technology acceptance among organisations and individual consumers. These theories include 
the  theory  of  reasoned  action  (TRA),  theory  of  planned  behaviour  (TPB),  technology 
acceptance model (TAM), and more recently, the extended unified theory of acceptance and 
use of technology (UTAUT2). The UTAUT2 is adopted as the theoretical foundation to form 
and guide the conduct of this study.  

4 

 
 
 
 
Venkatesh  et  al.  (2012)  proposed  the  extended  unified  theory  of  acceptance  and  use  of 
technology  (UTAUT2)  as  an  extension  of  the  unified  theory  of  acceptance  and  use  of 
technology (UTAUT) which was developed to predict organisations’ acceptance of technology 
(Venkatesh,  Morris,  Davis,  &  Davis,  2003).  The  UTAUT  distilled  and  brought  to  the  fore, 
critical factors and contingencies that relate to the prediction of behavioural intention to accept 
and the use of technology focusing mainly in  the context of organisation  (Venkatesh  et  al., 
2003). Since its original publication, the UTAUT has been used as a baseline model and has 
been applied in numerous studies evaluating varieties of technologies in both organisational 
and non-organisational settings. In addition to the popularity the model enjoyed, it has  also 
received many applications which have contributed immensely to fortifying its generalisability 
(Venkatesh et al., 2012). 

Over the years, technology acceptance has received a lot of recognition amongst researchers, 
as evidenced by the existence of numerous technology acceptance models and research works. 
M-Banking and its related applications have not been an exception as their acceptance has been 
predicted  using  five  models  (Merhi  et  al.,  2019).  These  models  include;  the  diffusion  of 
innovation theory (DOI) (Rogers, 1995), theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Fishbein & Ajzen, 
1975),  theory  of  planned  behaviour  (TPB)  (Ajzen,  1991),  technology  acceptance  models 
(TAM) (Davis, 1989), and theory of perceived risk (TPR) (Featherman & Pavlou, 2003). These 
models  were  however,  not  without  limitations.  In  order  to  overcome  the  limitation  of  the 
previously existing models, Venkatesh et al. (2003) proposed the UTAUT. The UTAUT model 
consisted of eight previously developed technology acceptance models. The UTAUT model 
was developed from four of the five models previously indicated and excluded the Theory of 
Perceived Risk (TPR). The four other models consolidated into the previous models to form 
the UTAUT include; the motivational model (MM) (Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1992), the 
PC  utilisation  model  (MPCU)  (Thompson,  Higgins  &  Howell,  1991),  the  social  cognitive 
theory (SCT) (Bandura, 1986), as well as the integrated model of technology acceptance and 
planned behaviour (TAM-TPB) (Taylor & Todd, 1995).  

The UTAUT model consisted of four constructs. These include performance expectancy, effort 
expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions. The model accurately predicted system 
usage and acceptance in an organisational setting and also accounted for other influences as 
well as interaction terms such as demographic variables (age, gender, experience) (Venkatesh, 
Brown, & Bala, 2013). This made the UTAUT more efficacious in technology acceptance over 
its  counterparts  (Venkatesh  and  Zhang,  2010).  UTAUT  was  applied  in  numerous  scenarios 
across  different  countries  and  industries  including  for  the  prediction  of  internet  technology 
(Servidio,  2014;  Touray,  2015)  internet  banking  (Martins,  Oliveira  and  Popovič,  2014a), 
mobile banking  (Afshan and Sharif, 2016; Bhatiasevi,  2016)  and e-government  (Rodrigues, 
Sarabdeen  and  Balasubramanian,  2016),  among  many  other  fields.  Notwithstanding  the 
success  of  UTAUT,  it  faced  its  own  limitations  as  the  conception  was  purely  based  on 
organisational settings rather than individual consumers (Negahban and Chung, 2014). Due to 
this limitation, there was the need to adapt and modify the model to better represent consumer 
acceptance and intention to use technology, especially e-business and e-commerce (Chen and 
Holsapple,  2013).  In  addition  to  the  previously  mentioned  limitation,  the  UTAUT  suffered 
other shortcomings such as task-technology fit, technology performance and user satisfaction 
which are pre-requisites for the measurement of technology usage and success (Montesdioca 
and Maçada, 2015).  

Recognising the shortcomings of the UTAUT, Venkatesh et al. (2012) modified and extended 
the  model  by  introducing  three  new  constructs;  hedonic  motivation,  price  value,  and  habit, 

5 

 
 
 
 
aimed at integrating the consumer context to address the limitations of the UTAUT (Merhi et 
al., 2019). The result of this was UTAUT2. The introduction of hedonic motivation as a new 
construct  is  considered  a  strong  predictor  that  emphasises  utility  which  was  missing  in  the 
initial  UTAUT.  Unlike  organisations,  ‘cost’  is  an  important  component  of  the  consumers 
decision  to  use  technology,  hence  the  integration  of  price  value.  Although  ‘behavioural 
intention’ has long been used to predict technology use, a new theorised construct called ‘habit’ 
is also considered another critical predictor for technology acceptance and use (Venkatesh et 
al,  2012),  hence  its  integration  as  a  construct.  Thus,  the  introduction  of  habit  highlights 
intention as an overarching mechanism and key driver of behaviour.  

Beyond  the  addition  of  three  constructs  to  the  initial  UTAUT,  the  UTAUT2  dropped 
voluntariness and rather proposed new relationships and moderators. For instance, a link was 
introduced  between  facilitating  conditions  and  behavioural  intentions.  Although  moderators 
were  part  of  the  UTAUT,  the  UTAUT2  proposed  new  moderators  which  were  tested  to  be 
valid. The initial UTAUT had performance expectancy moderated by age and gender; effort 
expectance moderated by age, gender, and experience; social influence was moderated by age, 
gender, and experience; and facilitating condition to use behaviour was moderated by age and 
experience.  UTAUT2  included  a  moderated  relationship  of  age,  gender,  and  experience 
pertaining to the three new constructs integrated. 

The  emergence  of  the  UTAUT2  has  facilitated  and  enhanced  the  concept  of  analysing 
consumer technology usage in a voluntary setting. UTAUT2 model showed higher superiority 
in the prediction of technology acceptance by achieving higher explanation of the variance in 
intention and use of technology (Venkatesh et al., 2012). Since its’ introduction, UTAUT2 has 
received validation and extension in multiple fields including mobile banking  (Baptista and 
Oliveira, 2015; Alalwan, Dwivedi and Rana, 2017; Merhi, Hone and Tarhini, 2019), internet 
banking (Alalwan, Dwivedi, Rana, Lal, & Williams, 2015), e-services (Fakhoury and Aubert, 
2017),  online  shopping/  e-commerce  (Fakhoury  and  Aubert,  2017;  Tarhini,  Alalwan,  & 
Algharabat, 2019), e-learning (El-Masri & Tarhini, 2017), and usage of smartphone (Ahmed, 

Figure 1 Original UTAUT2 Model (Venkatesh, Thong, & Xu, 2012) 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
Everatt and Fox-Turnbull, 2017; Ameen, Willis and Hussain Shah, 2018). These studies and 
validations  have  further  established  UTAUT2  as  a  more  comprehensive  framework  for  the 
evaluation technology acceptance and use in organisational and consumer context alike. The 
UTAUT2  is  therefore  adopted  as  the  theoretical  foundation  for  this  study.  Figure  1  shows 
detail constructs and the relationship among the various constructs in UTAUT2.  

2.3. Conceptual Model for the Study 

The conceptual framework for this study uses the extended unified theory of acceptance and 
use  of  technology  (UTAUT2)  as  its  theoretical  foundation  and  extends  it  with  relevant 
constructs.  Many  studies  have  used  TAM  as  the  base  model  in  investigating  the  factors 
facilitating internet or mobile banking adoption. Although TAM has extensively been used to 
predict user’s technology adoption behaviour, the model has been overtaken by UTAUT2. The 
TAM  theory  excludes  more  important  factors  that  explain  an  individual’s  technology 
acceptance such  as their enjoyment,  price value, habit, cultural  influence, and demographic 
variables. The UTAUT2 model has shown higher superiority in the prediction of technology 
acceptance by achieving higher explanation of the variance in intention and use of technology.  

While, the UTAUT2 has been validated in several industries and research settings, it falls short 
of constructs that have become relevant in the use of technology, particular, within the banking 
sector where risk is considered an important factor. The banking industry faces cyber security 
challenges  (Wechuli,  Franklin  and  Jotham,  2017).  These  challenges  make  factors  such  as 
security,  risk,  and  trust  important  consideration  by  consumers  to  use  M-Banking  Apps. 
Consequently, this study extends the UTAUT2  with  perceived security,  perceived  risk, and 
trust (institution and technology) as relevant constructs for the prediction of M-Banking Apps 
use by consumers. In addition to the above-mentioned constructs, the study will also examine 
how demographic characteristics (age, gender, educational level, income, and experience) act 
as moderators of user perceived security of M-Banking Apps. The present study will explore 
the relationship between the extended constructs and behavioural intentions on the one hand 
and  between  the  extended  constructs  and  user  behaviour  on  the  other  hand  with  the 
demographic characteristics moderating the relationships. Figure 2 demonstrates the proposed 
conceptual model. 

2.4. Hypotheses Formulation 

This  research  seeks  to  answer  the  question  on  how  characteristics  such  as  age,  gender, 
education, income, and experience moderate the effect of perceived security, perceived risk, 
institutional trust, and technology trust on M-Banking Apps. The following hypotheses have 
been developed with the aim of answering the main research question in this study. 

Performance Expectancy (PE)  

Performance expectancy is defined as “the degree to which an individual believes that using a 
system will help him or her to attain job performance” (Venkatesh et al., 2003). In effect, it is 
the benefit gained from using a technological innovation or system. This was considered as 
perceived usefulness in TAM (Davis, 1989), and relative advantage in DOI (Rogers, 1995). 
Performance expectancy suggests that individual will use computing technology if they believe 
the outcome of the usage will be positive. This reflects the perception of improvement by using 
mobile  banking  apps  technologies  such  as  the  speed  of  transactions,  the  convenience, 
ubiquitous and immediacy (Baptista and Oliveira, 2015). Performance expectancy is expected 

7 

 
 
 
 
to be one of the most important factors that influence the adoption and use of mobile banking 
applications (Merhi et al., 2019). Therefore, the following hypothesis is postulated:  

H1: Performance Expectancy will positively influence user behaviour towards adopting 
mobile banking apps 

Effort Expectancy (EE) 

Effort  expectancy  is  defined  as  “the  degree  of  ease  associated  with  the  use  of  a  system” 
(Venkatesh et al., 2003). In other words, the willingness of users to adopt technology is more 
likely when little effort is required to effectively use it. This was considered as perceived ease 
of use in  TAM  (Davis,  1989), and complexity in DOI  (Rogers, 1995).  Subsequently, effort 
expectancy has been validated in many studies that used UTAUT2 as a predictor of adoption 
and use of technology  (Venkatesh et  al.,  2012;  Alalwan et  al.,  2015;  Alalwan et  al.,  2017). 
Mobile banking consumers are more inclined to accept and technology that require less effort 
to use. As expected, studies have revealed that there is a positive correlation between perceived 
ease of use of M-Banking Apps and consumers initial willingness to use it (Venkatesh et al., 
2012; Aboelmaged, & Gebba, 2013; Raza, Umer, & Shah; 2017). In fact, service ease of use 
has been identified as the main reason consumers  adopted technology  (Akturan, &  Tezcan, 
2012).  It  is  assumed  in  this  study  that  users  are  more  likely  to  adopt  mobile  banking  apps 
service if it is believed to be easy to use. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:  

H2: Effort Expectancy will positively influence user behaviour towards adopting mobile 
banking apps 

Social Influence (SI)  

Social Influence is “the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe 
he or she should use the new system” (Venkatesh et al., 2003). This is because of the influence 
of  friends,  family,  colleagues  at  work  (co-workers)  and  the  broader  social  networking  sites 
(social media) on user perception and behaviour. TRA and TPB captured this as a subjective 
norm (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975; Ajzen, 1991), and DOI captured it as image (Rogers, 1995). 
Social influence includes families, friends, co-workers, traditional media, and the social media 
in  general.  Social  influence  has  shown  to  have  positive  effects  on  behavioural  intentions 
(Akturan, & Tezcan, 2012; Venkatesh et al., 2012). People are often influenced by others to 
use technology, especially in the UK where technology has become part of everyday life, it is 
expected that friends, family, and social media become influencers of technology usage. Hence, 
it is hypothesised that:  

H3: Social Influence  has a positive  effect on user behaviour towards adopting mobile 
banking apps. 

Facilitating Conditions (FC)  

Facilitating  conditions  are  defined  as  “the  degree  to  which  an  individual  believes  that  an 
organisational and technical infrastructure exist to support the use of technology” (Venkatesh 
et al., 2003). TRA and TPB captured this as perceived behavioural control (Fishbein & Ajzen, 
1975;  Ajzen,  1991),  and  DOI  captured  it  as  compatibility  (Rogers,  1995).  The  use  of  M-
Banking Apps requires some skills such as ability to install native apps, internet use experience, 
ability to use mobile phones or tablets as well as knowledge on security vulnerabilities. This 
implies  that  a  user  who  has  access  to  a  set  of  facilitating  conditions  such  as  demos,  video

Figure 2 Proposed Conceptual Model for the Study 

tutorials, manuals on mobile banking, and support chats will develop a greater intention to use 
the app (Baptista and Oliveira, 2015). Facilitating conditions, therefore, influences intention to 
adopt and use mobile apps, hence the hypothesis:  

H4a: Facilitating Conditions will positively influence user behaviour towards adopting 
mobile banking apps 

H4b:  Facilitating  Conditions  will  positively  influence  actual  use  behaviour  of  mobile 
banking apps 

Hedonic Motivation (HM) 

Hedonic  motivation  is  the  perceived  enjoyment,  amusement  and  the  pleasure  derived  from 
using a technological innovation.  Venkatesh et al. (2012) defined this as the “fun or pleasure 
derived from using technology”. As the enjoyment and entertainment value of mobile banking 
apps  increases,  the  greater  the  acceptance  of  use  of  the  technology  by  consumers.  Hedonic 
motivation  has  been  found  to  be  associated  with  strong  mobile  banking  use  intention 
(Venkatesh  et  al.,  2012;  Raza,  Umer,  &  Shah;  2017,  Aboelmaged,  &  Gebba,  2013).  These 
findings and previous studies have accounted for the increase in integrating hedonic motivation 
for m-banking commerce and applications. Enjoyable experience and fun attached to the use 
of  technology  continually  encourage  mobile  banking  consumers  to  use  technological-based 
services such as mobile banking apps. Therefore, the following hypothesis is postulated:  

9 

 
 
 
 
 
H5:  Hedonic  Motivation  positively  influences  behavioural  intention  to  adopt  mobile 
banking apps 

Price Value (PV)  

Price  value  is  defined  as  a  user’s  cognitive  trade-off  between  the  perceived  benefits  of 
technology and the monetary cost of using it (Venkatesh et al., 2012). Price value is considered 
positive when the benefits associated with a technology is perceived to be greater than the cost 
associated with using it. According to Merhi et al. (2019), services with good price values are 
more likely to attract consumers. Also, pivotal relationship has been established between price 
of technological services and the adoption of such technology (Venkatesh et al., 2012). In the 
UK, cost of mobile banking service is minimal or in some cases negligible. This is considered 
a  positive  step  towards  the  adoption  of  mobile  banking  service.  Therefore,  the  following 
hypothesis is proposed:  

H6: Price Value positively influences behavioural intention to adopt mobile banking apps 

Habit (HB) 

Habit deals with how people perform behaviour automatically due to learning. In effect, habit 
is considered as a learning behaviour with a pleasing outcome in response to automatic stimulus 
(Merhi et al., 2019). Thus, habit will be created if consumer use technology frequently. Habit 
has  been  determined  as  a  factor  in  predicting  consumers  behavioural  intention  to  use  m-
banking technology in numerous studies (Venkatesh et al., 2012; Merhi et al., 2019; Oliveira 
et al., 2016; Raza et al., 2017). Consumers have been identified to use more technology when 
they become habituated  to  its use (Oliveira et  al., 2016).  In this  study, it is  anticipated that 
continuous use of mobile banking apps will be achieved if consumers develop positive habits 
towards the services. Hence, it is hypothesised that: 

H7a: Habit will have a positive influence behavioural intention to adopt mobile banking apps 

H7b: Habit will have a positive influence on actual use behaviour of mobile banking apps 

Perceived Security (PS) 

Data breaches that may lead to possible of data leakage, theft by cyber-criminals and hackers 
have contributed to security being a major concern facing mobile banking. Perceived security 
is defined as the “degree of belief in a technology or system to transmit sensitive information 
without  breach  or  leakage”  (Merhi  et  al.,  2019).  Undoubtedly,  security  remains  one  of  the 
major  concerns  of  consumers  in  their  use  of  internet  banking  and  electronic  commerce 
platforms (Wazid,  Zeadally and Das, 2019). Cyber security  vulnerabilities and its  attendant 
challenges have left many to worry about online transactions. Adoption and use of M-Banking 
Apps have become a concern to consumers because of possible of data breaches and leakage, 
theft and damage caused by computer hackers and cybercriminals. While the UTAUT2 did not 
consider  the  aspect  of  security  in  the  acceptance  of  technology,  many  other  scholars  and 
researchers have listed user security-perception as critical inhibitors of m-banking acceptance 
and growth of the e-banking technology (Tarhini et al., 2016; Apau et al., 2019; Merhi et al., 
2019).  Without  consumers  being  convinced  of  the  security  of  M-Banking  Apps,  their  trust 
towards the usage of such systems will be non-existent. Hence, the following hypotheses are 
assumed: 

10 

 
 
 
 
H8a: Perceived Security will positively influence behavioural intention to adopt mobile 
banking apps with Age, Gender, Education, Income, and Experience as Moderators 

H8b: Perceived Security will positively influence actual use behaviour of mobile banking 
apps with Age, Gender, Education, Income, and Experience as Moderators 

Perceived Risk (PR) 

Perceived risk rather than perceived privacy is considered a relevant construct in this study. 
Contrary to other studies (Mullan, Bradley and Loane, 2017; Raza, Umer and Shah, 2017), that 
have argued for perceived privacy as a factor for electronic banking. This study deviates from 
such studies and rather considers perceived risk a critical determining factor of M-Banking app 
adoption.  For  instance,  Merhi  et  al.(2019)  hypothesised,  tested,  and  found  that  perceived 
privacy positively influenced behavioural intention of Lebanese and British consumers to adopt 
mobile banking. The deviation from perceived privacy to perceived risk stems from the fact 
that consumers consider the risk of losing money through their mobile banking transactions as 
a result of security vulnerabilities (Chen, 2013; Martins, Oliveira and Popovič, 2014b; Thakur 
and Srivastava, 2014), than the mere disclosure of their information if that cannot result in the 
loss  of  money  or  cause  any  substantial  damage.  Secondly,  information  disclosure  which 
perceived privacy seeks to address, is a component of security. Non-information disclosure is 
a  parameter  in  the  security  consideration  of  every  system  (Amro  and  Tiantian,  2017). 
Additionally,  the  theory  of  perceived  risk  (TPR)  considers  many  facets  of  risk,  including 
privacy. In TPR, Featherman and Pavlou (2003) defined perceived risk as the potential for loss 
in the pursuit of a desired outcome in using technology or electronic service. The review has 
shown that perceived risk influences people’s trust and security of a technological innovation 
(Chen, 2013; Roy et al., 2017). Thus, if users perceive a technology to be risky, they will not 
use it. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: 

H9:  Perceived  Risk  will  negatively  influence  behavioural  intention  to  adopt  mobile 
banking apps with Age, Gender, Education, Income, and Experience as Moderators 

Institutional Trust (IT) 

Trust  remains  a  critical  antecedent  that  influences  many  electronic  businesses  including 
internet banking, mobile banking and e-commerce (Apau, Koranteng and Gyamfi, 2019). Trust 
of vendors and sellers in online transactions is very important. Institutional trust is therefore 
the  trust  between  financial  service  providers  and  customers  based  on  customers  prior 
experience or good reputation (Merhi et al., 2019; Chiu, Chiu, & Mansumitrchai, 2016). Thus, 
higher trust  in  a service  provider will lower users perceived risk.  Therefore, with  increased 
trust  in  financial  institutions  and  the  banking  sector,  trust  in  the  use  of  mobile  banking 
application is expected to increase and the following hypothesis is anticipated: 

H10: Institutional Trust will positively influence behavioural intention to adopt mobile 
banking apps with Age, Gender, Education, Income, and Experience as Moderators 

Technological Trust (TT)  

The  desire  for  users  to  make  financial  transactions  using  mobile  banking  applications  are 
influenced  by  the  role  technology  plays.  Technology  remains  an  important  precursor  in 
encouraging and facilitating electronic business transactions. However, many users hesitate to 
transact business through electronic means due to lack of trust in the internet medium (Apau et 

11 

 
 
 
 
al., 2019). Technological trust is the trust of users in the internet medium or the channel used 
for banking transactions (Apau & Koranteng, 2019). Trust is also a subjective disposition to 
have positive assumptions for the consistent occurrence of an action (Al-Sharafi et al., 2018). 
Trust of technology has been found to be a critical predictor of behavioural intention to use 
technology.  Technology  Trust  is  also  considered  an  important  influencer  of  behavioural 
intention due to  its inverse relationship with  perceived risk  (Merhi  et  al.,  2019). Therefore, 
higher trust in technology will lower the perceived risk and positively affects user’s desire to 
use M-Banking Apps, hence the inclusion of trust as a new construct to be tested. Hence, the 
following hypothesis is proposed: 

H11: Technological Trust will positively influence behavioural intention to adopt mobile 
banking apps with Age, Gender, Education, Income, and Experience as Moderators 

Behavioural Intention (BI) 

Consistent  with  most  technology  acceptance  models  drawing  upon  psychological  theories, 
which argue that individual behaviour is predictable and influenced by individual intentions 
(Yu,  2012),  both  the  initial  UTAUT  and  UTAUT2  support  the  belief  and  assertion  that 
behavioural  intention  has  substantial  influence  on  technology  use  (Venkatesh  et  al.,  2003; 
Venkatesh et al., 2012). Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: 

H12: Behavioural Intention to adopt mobile banking apps will positively influence actual 
use behaviour of mobile banking apps 

Figure 3 provides detailed explanation of the hypothesised model. 

3. Research Methodology 

3.1 Data Collection 

The  survey  research  design  is  adopted  for  this  study.  In  terms  of  time  horizon,  this  study 
adopted cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. Studies on the antecedents of mobile banking 
adoption  exist.  However,  the  specific  respondents  of  this  study  are  likely  to  differ  from 
previous studies, hence the use of cross-sectional. In effect, the study employed cross-sectional 
data collection to examine user perceptions of the security of M-Banking Apps. The use of 
cross-sectional  research  design  in  this  study  is  to  establish  a  baseline  understanding  of  the 
factors that influence a user’s security perception of M-Banking Apps.  

Consequently, primary data collection was deemed the most feasible approach to achieve these 
research  objectives.  The  proposed  hypotheses  for  the  study  were  tested  using  quantitative 
research  approach  to  further  understand  and  evaluate  the  applicability  of  the  proposed 
conceptual model in explaining the user perceived security of M-Banking Apps. This study 
used questionnaire as a means of collecting quantitative primary data. The questionnaire used 
for data collection consisted of two parts and comprised forty-five (45) closed-ended questions. 
The  first  part  comprised  seven  (7)  closed-ended  questions  for  the  determination  of 
demographic  characteristics  of  study  respondents  using  a  nominal  scale.  These  questions 
included age, gender, education, occupation, income, experience in using M-Banking Apps, 
and frequency of using M-Banking apps. The second part comprised thirty-eight (38) closed-
ended questions. They included the original constructs of the UTAUT2 model. The specific 
questions under each construct were sourced from previous studies. Factors such as PE, SI, 
HM, HB, PV, and BI were measured using three items each, whereas four items were used to 
measure  EE  and  FC.  However,  each  of  the  extended  constructs  (PS,  PR,  IT  and  TT)  were 

12 

 
 
 
 
measured using three items. A 7-point Likert scale was adopted to measure the items used in 
the  questionnaire.  The  scale  ranges  are  1=Strongly  Disagree,  2=Disagree,  3=Somewhat 
disagree, 4=Neither Disagree nor Agree, 5=Somewhat Agree, 6=Agree and 7=Strongly Agree. 
According to Preston and Colman (2000), reliability is optimised when 7 point Likert response 
categories is  used. The  baseline UTAUT2 model  also  used 7 Likert scale (Venkatesh  et  al. 
(2012), and this will help in results comparison. 

The  study  adopted  an  online  survey  as  the  means  through  which  the  questionnaire  was 
disseminated among the target respondents. The data collection was, therefore, done distantly 
using Qualtrics. consequently, online questionnaire was distributed through various platforms 
including social media in the UK. Whilst this approach ensured that the questionnaire is widely 
distributed, responses were limited to UK consumers. Several approaches were employed to 
ensure the study findings are valid and reliable.  Three participants were used to pre-test the 
questionnaire to ensure content validity. A pilot study was conducted using 20 participants. 
This was done to ensure the readability and clarity of the questionnaire items and also to verify 
if  the  collected  data  answered  the  questions  under  investigation  by  providing  face  validity 
(Brace, 2018). The pilot study was also done to ensure the conclusion and information obtained 
is credible for construct validity. The pilot study resulted in the removal of two questions under 
perceived security and the modification of two other questions.  

The study adopted non-probability sampling as the technique for data collection. Specifically, 
the convenience sampling technique was employed. The overall consideration in selecting the 
sampling technique includes the size of the study population, the extent of ease of access to the 
study respondents as well as the homogeneity of the population. The convenience sampling 
also  enabled  data  collection  from  potential  study participants who are readily available. By 
using convenience sampling, any UK banking consumer is eligible to participate in the study 
without  exception.  Many  researchers  have  adopted  this  sampling  approach  in  the  past  for 
similar studies (Williams, 2018; Lim et al., 2019; Merhi et al., 2019).  

3.2. Data Analysis 

This  study  adopted  Covariance-Based  Structural  Equation  Modelling  (CB-SEM)  as  the 
statistical  technique  for  the  data  analysis.  SEM  is  a  statistical  technique  that  allows 
simultaneous testing and estimation of a hypothesised relationships in conceptual framework 
(Gefen,  Straub,  &  Boudreau,  2000).  It  helps  to  determine  multiple  correlations  between 
endogenous (dependent) and exogenous (independent) variables. SEM has been identified as 
one of the most suitable techniques for elaborating concepts and theories without the need to 
resort to multiple statistical methods (Tabachnick, Fidell, & Ullman, 2007). The decision to 
adopt SEM for this study was based on the technique’s appropriateness and applicability  in 
situations  where  there  is  the  occurrence  of  transition  between  exogenous  (dependent)  and 
endogenous (independent) variables as in the case of behavioural intentions (Wang & Wang, 
2019). 

Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modelling was applied using the Analysis of Moment 
Structures (AMOS version 26). The CB-SEM was adopted for the study due to its aptness and 
appropriateness  for  testing  and  confirming  existing  theory  (Wang  &  Wang,  2019).  The 
demographic  characteristics  of  the  study  were  analysed  using  descriptive  statistics  (Mean, 
standard deviation, frequency counts, Skewness, Kurtosis and Alpha value). The conceptual 
model was analysed using the measurement model and structural model approaches.

4. Results 

4.1. Descriptive Analysis 

Data were screened for duplicate responses and missing data. There were no missing data and 
duplicate  responses.  Further  treatment  was  therefore  not  required.  Three  (3)  respondents 
indicated they have never used M-Banking Apps. These were removed, as the study aims to 
measure the experiences of M-Banking users. Consequently, 315 valid responses were retained 
for the final data analysis.  

The initial proposed model consisted of 12 constructs and 38 indicators. These constructs are 
PE,  EE,  SI,  FC,  HM,  HB,  PV,  PS,  PR,  IT,  TT,  and  BI.  All  constructs  consisted  of  three 
indicators  each,  except  EE  and  FC  that  were  measured  using  four  indicators.  The  mean 
response for all the construct indicators was above 4 as shown in  Table 1. The mean value 
ranges from 4.23 (HB3) to 6.39 (FC2). An indication that the majority of participants expressed 
generally positive responses to the factors in this study. A test of normality was conducted to 
examine whether the data is normally distributed and accurate for data analysis. The absolute 
kurtosis value ranges from 0.03 (HM1) to 10.169 (PE1) and absolute skewness value ranges 
from  0.193  (PR2)  to  3.291  (PE1).  The  maximum  kurtosis  value  was  10.169≈10  and  the 
maximum  skewness  value  was  3.291≈3.  When  utilising  SEM,  the  rule  of  thumb  suggests 
absolute kurtosis value of |±10| and skewness value of |±3| are considered appropriate (Kline, 
2005; Brown, 2015). This means that all 36 data items in the dataset met the criteria normal 
distribution.  Kolmogorov-Smirnova (K-S) and Shapiro-Wilk (S-W) tests  were conducted to 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
examine  the  sample  distribution  for  possible  response  bias.  Both  tests  were  statistically 
significant for all sample indicating that non-response bias was not present (Ryans, 1974) (see 
Table 1).  

As shown in Table 2, a close distribution of gender was observed. Also, the age distribution 
indicates that the respondents were predominantly young, aged 16-44 years (more than 90%). 
This  possibly  explains the greater level  of  levels of M-Banking  experience recorded in  this 
study. More than 85% of the respondents reported M-Banking usage experience of two (2) or 
more years. In order to better understand the use of technology in a population-based study, 
the  participation  of  the  older  generation  is  valuable.  However,  a  majority  youthful 
participation, who often have an affinity towards technology facilitates understanding of M-
banking use intentions (Merhi, Hone and Tarhini, 2019). Majority (61.91%) indicated master’s 
degree education qualification.  

4.2. Analysis of Measurement Model 

The two step approach advocated by Anderson and Gerbing (1988) was employed to 
investigate  the  relationship  in  the  proposed  conceptual  model.  Firstly,  confirmatory  factor 
analysis  (CFA)  was  employed  to  test  the  model  fitness.  The  study  employed  Coltman  et 
al.(2008)’s recommendations for analysing validity and reliability of the measurement model. 
The second step involved structural model analysis to test the proposed relationship between 
the  exogenous  variables  (PE,  EE,  SI,  FC,  HM,  HB,  PV,  PS,  PR,  IT,  TT)  and  endogenous 
variable (BI) on one part, and exogenous variables (BI, FC, HB, PS) and endogenous variable 
(UB) on another part.  

By employing the maximum likelihood method, the model’s parameters were estimated using 
covariance metrices as recommended by Hair, Black, and Babin (2010). The indices examined 
in respect of this recommendation include df, GFI, AGFI, CFI, RMSR, RMSEA, NFI and PNFI 
(Please refer to table 3 for the meaning of these statistical abbreviations). The sample achieved 
a good measurement model fit as indicated in Table 3. 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
Having achieved a good fitness model (see Table 3) validity and reliability of the constructs 
in the proposed model were evaluated. The model was assessed for composite reliability (CR), 
convergence  validity  using  average  variance  extracted  (AVE),  internal  consistency  using 
Cronbach’s Alpha, indicator reliability using item loadings, Kaiser Meyer Olkin (KM O), and 
Bartlett’s  test  of  sphericity  as  shown  in  Table  4.  CR  is  employed  to  examine  construct 
reliability. The recommended value for CR is 0.7 to achieve good reliability (Hair et al., 2010), 
and as indicated in Table 4, all constructs achieved CR values greater 0.7. All item loadings 
were  above  the  0.7  threshold  (Thompson,  Barclay,  &  Higgins,  1995),  confirming  a  good 
indicator reliability of the instruments. The study achieved Cronbach’s Alpha values greater 
than  0.7  as  recommended  by  Straub  (1989),  suggesting  constructs’  validity.  Convergent 
validity confirms the reflective nature of each construct by its own indicators, in ensuring that 
multiple-item  factors  are  unidimensional  (Gefen,  Straub,  &  Boudreau,  2000)  and  that 
unreliable  indicators  are  eliminated  (Bollen,  1989).  To  ensure  convergent  validity,  average 
variance extracted (AVE) should be above 0.5 as required by (Wixom & Watson, 2001) and

the  AVE  should  also  be  smaller  than  the  CR.  AVEs  for  the  constructs  were  above  0.5  and 
smaller than CR, an indication that adequate reliability and convergent validity were achieved.  

As indicated in Table 5, discriminant validity test was analysed based on Fornell and Lacker 
as well as cross-loadings criteria. Discriminant validity provides assessment for the extent to 
which measures different concepts are statistically significant (Gefen et al., 2000). Square roots 
of AVEs were computed and compared with their factor correlations values. The bold-faced 
values  as  shown  in  the  diagonal  of  Table  5,  verifying  the  conditions  of  being  greater  than 
correlations  values  of  constructs  and  AVEs  as  recommended  (Fornell  &  Larcker,  1981), 
suggesting discriminant validity. The rule of thumb further suggests that a cross factor loading 
of not more than 0.7 is required (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). The study assessed the possibility 
of multicollinearity among the exogenous constructs using bivariate correlation. The rule of 
thumb  suggests  that  correlation  value  greater  than  0.7  suggests  the  presence  of  collinearity 
(Tomaschek, Hendrix, & Baayen, 2018). A further test of multicollinearity was analysed by 
computing the variance inflation factor (VIF). VIF values less than 3 is required to avoid the

Note: Recommended values are as required by Hair et al. (2016) 

presence of multicollinearity (Hair et al., 2016). The maximum correlation value was 0.701 
and the highest VIF was 2.793, suggesting multicollinearity was not present in the sample data.  

Common  method  variance  (CMV)  was  evaluated  using  Liang  et  al's  (2007)  recommended 
approach. The method factor computed was below 0.2, indicating common method bias is not 
a concern. Post hoc estimation of CMV was also assessed based on Malhotra, Kim, and Patil 
(2006) and Lindell and Whitney's (2001) approaches. A conservative estimate of the second-
smallest positive correlation value (0.2) was deducted from all correlations. A re-run of the 
analysis showed no significant difference between original correlation values and the adjusted 
correlations estimates, suggesting CMV is not a problem in this study. Having achieved good 
constructs validity, convergence validity, indicator reliability and discriminant validity as per 
the  results  of  the  measurement  model  analysis,  there  is  evidence  of  statistically  distinct 
constructs to test the structural model.

4.3. Analysis of Structural Model 

The  study  took  a  multi-staged  approach  to  analyse  the  structural  model.  Specifically,  the 
regression model building adopted the stepwise model building procedure using hierarchical 
regression  model  as  recommended  by  Pezzullo,  (2013).  Four  models  were  run  separately. 
Model 1 considered the constructs of the baseline UTAUT2 (PE, EE, SI, FC, HM, PV, and 
HB) to test the direct effects on the original model only. In Model 2, the UTAUT2 constructs 
were run with the new constructs (PS, PR, IT and TT). The Model 3 combined the baseline 
constructs  of  UTAUT2,  the  new  constructs  and  the  moderators  (age,  gender,  experience, 
income, and education). Lastly, the interaction terms were introduced in the fourth stepwise 
model  (Model  4)  to  determine  the  effects  of  the  interactions  terms  in  predicting  the  model 
outcome.  In  each  of  these  processes,  changes  in  the  significance  relationship  between 
independent and dependent variables, as well R-Square (R2) changes were observed. Due to 
the complexity of the proposed relationships, spilt-sample analyses and plots were conducted 
in addition to the beta-coefficients, to understand the results patterns. 

As indicated in Table 6, five constructs (EE, FC, HM, HB, and PV) of the basic structure of 
UTAUT2 were confirmed on BI and all the three constructs (BI, FC, and HB) were confirmed 
in UB. The results achieved, therefore, supports the applicability and validity of UTAUT2 as

theoretical  base in  predicting user’s behavioural  intention and use behaviour of M-Banking 
Apps.  The  variance  in  behavioural  intention  and  use  behaviour  explained  by  the  UTAUT2 
direct  effects  were  41.5  percent  and  15.9  percent,  respectively.  The  direct  effects  of  the 
proposed  model  and  the  proposed  model  with  interaction  terms  explained  43%  and  79% 
respectively  of  the  variance  of  behavioural  intentions.  Similarly,  on  the  use  behaviour,  the 
variance explained 32.1% and 54.7% for direct effects only and interaction terms, respectively. 
Figure 4 shows detailed results of the final structural model. The results of the higher order 
interactions terms are indicated in Table 7.  

5. Discussion of Findings 

5.1 Main Findings 

The study presented a unique theoretical model that combined four new constructs; perceived 
security,  perceived  risk,  institutional  trust  and  technological  trust  with  the  extended  unified 
theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) of (Venkatesh et al., 2012), to explain 
user perceived security of M-Banking Apps. Theoretically, the results obtained in this study 
differed from that of UTAUT2 model, in that two relationships were not supported. Some of 
the  constructs  were  also  found  to  be  more  critical  in  this  study  than  the  original  UTAUT2 
model.  The  results  further  show  that  majority  of  the  study  respondents  expressed  positive 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
responses to the constructs measured in this study. This supported earlier findings of Merhi et 
al. (2019), in which consumers based in England showed similar favourable responses. 

As shown by the path coefficient obtained in this study, the behavioural intention to adopt M-
Banking Apps was influenced by effort expectancy, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, 
price value, habit, perceived security, and trust (institutional and technological). Unexpectedly, 
performance expectancy, social influence and perceived risk were not significant. Also, use 
behaviour of M-Banking Apps was influenced by behavioural intention, facilitating condition, 
habit, and perceived security. In terms of moderation, age, gender, experience, income, and 
education  moderated  the  relationship  between  perceived  security  and  behavioural  intention, 
and the effect was stronger for younger men, particularly with high income and high education 
in early stages of experience with M-Banking adoption. The relationship between perceived 
security and use behaviour was also moderated by age, gender and experience, the effect was 
stronger for younger men in early stages of experience with M-Banking Apps use. The effect 
of  institutional  trust  on  behavioural  intention  was  moderated  by  age,  gender,  experience, 
income and education, such that the effects were stronger for older women, particularly with 
high income and education in later stages of experience with M-Banking adoption. Meanwhile, 
the relationship between technological trust and behavioural intention was moderated by age, 
education,  and  experience,  such  that  the  effect  was  stronger  for  older  people  with  high 
education in later stages of experience with M-Banking adoption.  

The proposed model’s importance  as an effort to elucidate user’s security perception of M-
Banking Apps is clearly supported. The model does not rely only on the main relationship of 
the UTAUT2 but incorporates new constructs (PS, PR, IT and TT) and relationship that extends 
the applicability of the UTAUT2 model to M-Banking Apps context. The final model explained 
79  percent  and  54  percent  in  variance  of  behaviour  intention  and  use  behaviour.  This  is 
substantial,  compared  with  baseline  UTAUT2  that  explained  74  percent  and  52  percent  of 
variance in intention and technology use (Venkatesh et al., 2012). The model was re-run with 
significant variables alone to observe the change in R2. The results show that R2 reduced by 
less than 2 percent. The majority of the significant variables in this study also achieved medium 
to large effect sizes. Effect sizes are by defaults 0.02, 0.15 and 0.35 indicating small, medium, 
and large effects respectively (Cohen, 1988). This makes the proposed model superior to the 
original UTAUT2 in explaining user technology behaviour. 

Many scholars, including Venkatesh et al. (2012) have stressed the need and the importance to 
broaden the generalisability and applicability of UTAUT2 in a different context and dissimilar 
group  to  that  of  the  original  study  settings.  The  study  has  effectively  achieved  this  by 
supporting the applicability of the UTAUT2 theory in an M-Banking Apps use context. The 
literature on technology adoption as well as acceptance models and theories have, therefore, 
been enhanced and greatly expanded through this study. This is an indication that the proposed 
extensions are critical to affirming the predictive validity of UTAUT2 in examining the security 
perception of users in mobile banking applications use context.  

Perceived security predicted behavioural intention and use behaviour of M-Banking Apps. In 
fact, perceived security was found to be the most significant factor and contributed the most to 
the variance in behavioural intention. The findings support many other earlier studies that have 
also found security as a major determining factor in M-banking adoption (Svilar and Zupančič, 
2016; Tham et al., 2017; Patel and Patel, 2018; Shareef et al., 2018; Rahi and Abd. Ghani, 
2018;  Merhi  et  al.,  2019).    However,  the  findings  contradicted  those  of  Lim  et  al.  (2019). 
Expectedly, younger men with a high level of education and income at the early stages of M-
Banking adoption showed a stronger perception of security. This finding presupposes the mass 

23 

 
 
 
 
adoption  of  M-Banking  Apps  is  somewhat  dependent  on  the  overall  security  perception 
irrespective of the actual security controls that have been implemented. Security remains a big 
concern and barrier to M-Banking Apps due to the possibility of data breach and cyber-attacks. 
Therefore, reinforcement of IT infrastructure and security control mechanism remain crucial 
in ensuring the highest form of security in M-Banking Apps to allay the fears of users.  

Trust remains one of the most important factors in online transactions. In the context of M-
banking, Merhi et al., (2019) earlier underscored the need to categorise trust into institutional 
trust and the trust of technology. Both institutional trust and technological trust were found to 
be significant predictors of M-Banking Apps behavioural intention. These results confirmed 
previous findings (Muñoz-Leiva et al., 2017; Tham et al., 2017; Alalwan et al., 2017; Stewart 
& Jürjens, 2018; Namahoot and Laohavichien, 2018; Merhi et al., 2019). However, the findings 
contradict other studies which did not find trust as a significant factor for behavioural intention 
to  adopt  technology  (Shareef et  al., 2018; Williams,  2018;  Alonso-Dos-Santos  et  al.  2020). 
While  age,  gender,  experience,  income,  and  education  moderated  the  relationship  between 
institutional  trust  and  behavorial  intention,  technological  trust  and  behavorial  intention 
relationship  was  moderated  by  age,  education,  and  experience.  The  results  demonstrate  the 
need for adequate management of customer security concerns and protecting the security of M-
Banking Apps at all times. Also, detailed user-friendly reports on security implementations and 
improvements  such  as  two  factor  authentication  could  be  regularly  desseminated.  This  is 
because, trust has emerged as an important impactful factor for M-Banking Apps adoption and 
has  significantly  demonstrated  user  disposition  towards  M-Banking  technology.  Also,  the 
delicate nature of mobile financial transaction could account for the undeniable effects of trust. 

The increasing trend in cyber-attacks, data compromises, and breaches (Wiafe et al., 2020), 
were  expected  to  affect  users’  risk  perception  of  mobile  financial  transactions.  Contrary  to 
expectations, perceived risk was not found to be a predictor of behavioural intention to adopt 
M-Banking Apps. Whist this finding is consistent with previous studies (Muñoz-Leiva et al., 
2017;  Williams,  2018),  it  is  at  variance  with  many  others  that  found  perceived  risk  as  an 
important factor for mobile banking use intention (Chen, 2013; Namahoot and Laohavichien, 
2018; Alonso-Dos-Santos et al., 2020). Perhaps, the introduction of General Data Protection 
Regulations (GDPR) in  2018 has effectively  mitigated the mobile banking risk concerns of 
banking consumers. GDPR has brought strict controls and compliance to privacy measures and 
institutions that fail to comply are faced with prospects of heavy fines/sanctions.  

The model validated five constructs of the UTAUT2 model on behaviour intention. These are 
effort  expectancy,  facilitating  conditions,  hedonic  motivation,  price  value  and  habits.  The 
influence of two others; performance expectancy and social influence were not confirmed in 
this  study.  Similarly,  all  three  constructs  (behavioural  intention,  facilitating  condition  and 
habit)  of  the  UTAUT2  on  use  technology  were  validated.  The  effort  expectancy  finding  is 
consistent  with  earlier  research  (Venkatesh  et  al.,  2012;  Alalwan  et  al.,  2017;  Merhi  et  al., 
2019), but contradicts the findings of other studies (Im et al., 2011; Baptista & Oliveira, 2015). 
The  effort  expectancy  finding  could  be  due  to  the  increasing  trend  of  familiarity  with 
technology in the UK. The familiarity provides restriction for the influence of effort expectancy 
to users who are not well acquainted with a particular technology system. Banking institutions 
and policy makers should therefore continue the design of a more user-friendly interface and 
develop banking applications that are adaptive to different devices and sizes.  

Price  value  was  observed  to  be  a  significant  predictor  of  behavioural  intention,  confirming 
previous studies such as Venkatesh et al. (2012) and Merhi et al. (2019). The finding however, 
contradicts Baptista and Oliveira (2015) which found the price value not to be a predictor of 

24 

 
 
 
 
behavioural  intention.  This  finding  could  be  attributed  to  the  low  cost  or  absence  of  cost 
associated with the use of mobile banking applications in the UK. Contrary to studies such as 
Merhi et al. (2019), hedonic motivation was found to be a factor that influence the adoption of 
M-Banking Apps. This finding is consistent with previous research (Venkatesh  et al., 2012; 
Baptista & Oliveira, 2015; Alalwan et al., 2017 ). This suggests that English consumers do not 
view M-Banking Apps as a beneficial service only but also bring them fun and enjoyment.  

Habit was considered the second most important factor influencing behavioural intention and 
use  behaviour  of  M-Banking  Apps  in  line  with  earlier  research  (Venkatesh  et  al.,  2012; 
Alalwan et al., 2017; Merhi et al., 2019). This result could be attributed to the established role 
of technology in the UK banking sector, which has made online transactions a daily routine in 
many  cases.  Similarly,  facilitating  conditions  was  found  to  be  a  significant  predictor  of 
behavioural intention and use behaviour, confirming previous studies (Venkatesh et al., 2012; 
Alalwan et al., 2017). Banks could therefore continue to provide support services to users. 

Conversely,  performance  expectancy  and  social  influence  emerged  as  non-significant 
predictors M-Banking Apps adoption intention. This confirms an earlier study by Merhi et al. 
(2019) which reported that British consumers do not consider performance expectancy as an 
important  factor  that  influences  their  adoption  behaviour.  Clearly,  the  decision  to  use 
technology  in  itself  demonstrates  usefulness.  Perhaps,  more  features  and  services  could  be 
introduced into the Apps to make it more beneficial. Regarding social influence, the findings 
were  consistent  with  previous  studies  (Baptista  &  Oliveira,  2015;  Merhi  et  al.,  2019). 
Communication  regarding  financial  information  is  always  kept  private,  which  probably 
explains the findings. 

5.2. Conclusion 

Mobile banking applications have gained a lot of popularity within the digital space and have 
significantly  revolutionised  the  banking  industry.  Despite  the  convenience  offered  by  M-
Banking Apps, users are often distrustful of the security of the applications due to increasing 
trend of cyber security compromises, cyber-attacks and data breaches associated with online 
financial  transactions.  Perception  of  security  and  the  associated  threats  have  increased 
substantially  among  users  and  innovators  of  mobile  financial  applications.  This  is  mainly 
because,  perceived  security  has  been  found  to  be  an  influencing  factor  for  mobile  banking 
usage.  Security  has  therefore  become  an  important  consideration  in  M-Banking  Apps 
development and use. Despite significant security and privacy concerns of M-Banking Apps, 
there is limited research in this domain.  

The results indicated that most constructs of the baseline UTAUT2 structure were validated. 
Effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value and habit were found 
to influence behavioural intention to adopt M-Banking Apps. Similarly, facilitating conditions, 
habit  and  behavioural  intention  influenced  M-Banking  use  behaviour.  Unexpectedly, 
performance expectancy and social influence were not confirmed in this study. In terms of the 
extended constructs, perceived security, institutional trust and technology trust were confirmed 
as factors that affect user’s intention to adopt and use M-Banking Apps. Perceived risk was 
however, not confirmed as a predictor.  

The current study further revealed that in the context of mobile banking applications, the effects 
of security, institution and technology trust are complex. First, the impact of perceived security 
on  behavioural  intention  is  moderated  by  gender,  age,  experience,  income,  and  education. 
Second, the effect of perceived security on use behaviour is moderated by age,  gender, and 
experience. Third, the impact of institutional trust on behavioural intention is moderated by 

25 

 
 
 
 
gender,  age,  experience,  income,  and  education.  Finally,  the  effect  of  technology  trust  on 
behavioural  intention  is  moderated  by  age,  education,  and  experience.  Overall,  the  study 
confirmed  the  important  role  of  security  in  influencing  M-Banking  Apps  use,  as  perceived 
security was found to be the most important factor that predict user behavioural intention and 
use behaviour of M-Banking Apps.  

5.3. Main Contribution and Advancement of Research 

The major theoretical contribution of this study is in modifying UTAUT2 for mobile banking 
applications  adoption  and  use  context.  By  so  doing,  the  generalisability  of  the  UTAUT2  is 
extended from technology acceptance and use context to a more specific for M-Banking Apps. 
The  UTAUT2  has  been  validated  and  applied  in  many  technological  settings,  where 
performance expectancy has been the main driver of technology  acceptance and use. In the 
specific  case  of  M-Banking  Apps,  other  important  drivers  come  to  play.  Factors  such  as 
security, privacy, risk, and trust are important drivers in online financial transactions. Security 
is a critical determinant of behavioural intention of M-Banking Apps and found to be a more 
important driver in mobile banking use.  

The study contributed to addressing a noteworthy gap in extant M-Banking Apps literature, 
particularly on the extension of UTAUT2 with institutional trust and technological trust. Trust 
remains  a  critical  variable  in  online  financial  transactions  and  the  addition  remarkably 
improved the explanatory power of UTAUT2 in achieving a good model fit. The study further 
delineated  how  individual  characteristics  and  differences  such  as  gender,  age,  experience, 
income, and education jointly moderate the effect of security on behavioural intention and use 
behaviour as well as trust on behavioural intention. Interestingly, the results from this study are 
that  the  effect  of  security  on  behavioural  intention  are  stronger  in  younger  men  with  high 
income and education who are less experience in M-Banking Apps use, while the effect of trust 
was  more  important  for  older  women  (aged  45  years  and  above)  with  high  income  and 
education who are much experienced in M-Banking Apps use.  

In summary, the proposed model incorporates not only the main relationship from UTAUT2, 
but also new constructs and relationships that extend the applicability of the UTAUT2 in the 
mobile banking application context. Empirical support has been provided for the applicability 
of UTAUT2 in a different cultural and industry settings in a way that offers a better explanation 
for the adoption and use of technology. 

5.4. Managerial and Practical Implications 

Mobile  banking  applications  have  revolutionised  the  banking  industry.  The  findings  of  this 
study have several managerial and practical contributions. The results presented in this study 
provide relevant practical information to stakeholders and businesses in the UK financial sector 
as well as countries of similar cultural settings on user-perceived security of M-Banking Apps. 
The study has demonstrated the importance of institutional trust and technological and how 
they  influence  user’s  behaviour  in  adopting  mobile  banking  applications.  The  guarantee  of 
enhanced security, advanced privacy mechanisms and trust should be considered paramount in 
future strategies aimed at promoting mobile banking adoption and use of technology.  

It  is  also  recommended  for  mobile  apps  developers,  software  engineers,  and  computer 
programmers  to  integrate  major  security  features  into  the  development  of  banking  apps  to 
curtail data breaches and cyber security vulnerabilities. Institutional trust can be improved by 
improving  brand  image  through  celebrity  endorsement,  displaying  positive  reviews  about 
institutions services among many others. Similarly, technology trust can also be improved by 

26 

 
 
 
 
integrating features that portray the app to be trustworthy and credible. For example, showing 
logos  on  “established  security  institutions”  in  the  form  of  third-party  endorsements,  letting 
users control their privacy settings or giving users a real-world feel by showing an “About Us” 
page which displays the manufacturers and bank’s management improves credibility and trust.    
These  measures,  when  adopted  will  contribute  significantly  by  boosting  the  trust  and 
confidence of the mobile banking system and further reduce the perceived risks associated with 
it. Improvement in the security and privacy of mobile banking apps will particularly benefit 
UK bank managers, as it will lead to increasing trend of adoption and use, thereby ultimately 
reducing  in  branch  transactions.  This  will  result  in  cost  savings  since  operational  cost 
associated with branch operations will be drastically reduced.  

5.5. Limitations and Directions for Future Research 

The data for this study was collected using non-probabilistic sampling technique. Specifically, 
the  convenience  sampling  technique  was  employed  for  the  data  collection.  This,  therefore, 
places limitation on the generalisability of the study findings to the whole population. A more 
representative sampling approach, that eliminates possible sampling biases could be adopted 
in a future study. For instance, clustering and random sampling approach could be adopted to 
further help understand user’s perception.  

The complexity of the  model proposed for this  study made it difficult  for a sub analysis of 
users’ responses based on the category of banks whose mobile apps they use were not done. 
By categories, the researcher is referring to mobile banking apps developed by traditional banks 
(eg Barclays, HSBC, Santander, NatWest etc.) and those developed by purely modern digital 
banks (eg Monzo, Monese, Starling etc.). This is because, customers of these two categories 
have  different  banking  experiences.  While  those  in  the  traditional  banks  have  access  to 
branches to make transactions if they doubt mobile banking transactions, modern digital banks 
are purely online and branchless. It would therefore be interesting to explore how customers of 
these two categories perceive the security of the mobile banking apps. Future research should 
therefore  consider  this  limitation  by  providing  clear  and  a  comprehensively  extensive 
understanding of user-perceived security of mobile banking applications. 

The study did not get enough respondents aged 45+ which ultimately may affect observations 
made, though initial observations indicate that the older generation has less trust in the security 
of M-Banking Apps. Again, the older generation particularly those over 55 years are likely to 
be  less  comfortable  with  adopting  M-Banking  Apps  because  of  the  generation  gap,  hence 
further research focusing primarily on those aged 45+ years is necessary to understand attitudes 
of this age group towards mobile banking applications. 

Finally, future research could arrive at a better understanding of the user-perceived security of 
M-Banking Apps by integrating cultural dimensions. Hofstede cultural dimensions integration 
could  be  interesting,  considering  the  unexpected  results  of  this  study  such  as  the  social 
influence  and  perceived  risk.  UK  has  a  diverse  cultural  population,  comprising  people 
originally  from  typical  collectivist  and  individualist  cultural  settings.  Integrating  cultural 
dimensions  into  the  proposed  model  will  therefore  provide  a  better  understanding  of  user-
perceived security of M-Banking Apps.
