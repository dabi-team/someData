literature 
surrounding cyber security threats in the 2020 US Elections. It 
begins with a brief overview of cyber security and the current 
state of cyber security regarding elections. In the main body of 
the paper, the focus will be on the literature review of three main 
areas:  voter  suppression,  voter  fraud,  and  disinformation, 
considering their impacts on the outcome of the election and on 
the voting public. Having evaluated sources on each this paper 
concludes by summarising the areas which have had the greatest 
impact on the 2020 US elections.

suppression; disinformation 

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Cyber security has become a foremost concern in society; 
it  protects  all  manner  of  data  and  systems,  from  personal 
emails to the controls of a nuclear power station. Naturally, it 
follows that the more we come to rely on technology, the more 
we rely on cyber security measures to protect us from external 
threats  or  internal  vulnerabilities.  Few  events  feel  such 
tensions more keenly than an election, where tampering can 
subtly  and  significantly  affect  the  outcome  of  the  voting 
process,  whether  by  altering  the  votes  themselves,  or 
discrediting candidates and voting measures [1].  

The  most  prominent  current  example  of  cyber  attacks 
threatening an election would be the United States of America, 
where  the  dangers  of  potential  foreign  interference  in  the 
process  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  security  concerns, 
particularly concerning Russia, though attribution is difficult 
to prove definitively [2] [3] [4].  In addition to the threat of 
experienced  third-party  attackers  actively  trying  to  cause 
harm, we must also consider the problems posed by the voting 
equipment.  Some  US  voting  machines  were  found  to  have 
substantial vulnerabilities built-in to them or not compensated 
for.  Direct-recording  electronic  machines  (DREs)  used 
following  the  2000  US  elections  were  paperless;  units 
installed to reduce issues with punch card ballots. As a result, 
they had no way of allowing a user to check their ballot before 
casting  it,  essentially  leaving  no  paper  trail  (literally  or 
figuratively) should there be an error or interference [3]. 

It is widely agreed that the  use of physical ballots is  the 
best way to prevent fallout from cyber attacks [1] and yet the 
Brennan Center for Justice projected that as many as 12% of 
the voting public would be using paperless voting machines 
[5].  The  use  of  such  outdated  machines,  coupled  with  the 
threat of external (or internal) attack, makes the question of 
cyber security an extremely pressing one.  

Although the security of voting hardware is important, it’s 
generally agreed that no ballots were altered in the 2016 attack 
[6],  leading  some  to  argue  that  the  greater  threat  to  the  US 
elections is not so much the machines, but the infrastructure 

surrounding  it  [2].  In  particular,  the  Cybersecurity  and 
Infrastructure  Security  Agency  (CISA)  consider  voter 
registration  systems  and  pollbooks  to  be  among  the  top 
elements to have the “greatest functional impact” [7] should 
they come under attack, a notion supported by evidence that 
data from voting registration systems was accessed in the 2016 
election, possibly with the intent of using it for a future attack 
[2]. 

II.  AIMS 

In  this  paper  I  will  review  the  existing  research 
surrounding  cyber  security  issues  with  US  elections  and 
consider  the  impact  of  such  threats  to  the  election  process. 
Though  cyber  attacks  can  take  a  variety  of  forms,  in  the 
context of elections there are three key categories: voter fraud, 
is 
voter  suppression,  and  disinformation.  Voter  fraud 
concerned  with  attacking  or  altering  the  outcome  of  an 
election; voter suppression involves discouraging individuals 
from casting their vote and/or disrupting the voting process; 
disinformation spreads false or misleading information about 
the  voting  process  or  candidates  in  order  to  colour  voters’ 
perceptions of the election.  

III.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

A.  Voter Suppression 

In terms of voter suppression, two viable areas of attack 
are highlighted by the research: the voting infrastructure [1] 
and  the  machines  themselves  [8].  Part  of  the  danger  comes 
from election officials suffering  an “information gap” [1, p. 
61] in their understanding of online threats, meaning that the 
individuals  writing  security  policy  sometimes  do  not  know 
how  best  to  counter  the  problem.  Hoke  [1]  suggests  this 
deficiency  in  comprehension,  coupled  with  a  lack  of 
appropriate safeguarding, is the shatter point for election cyber 
security.  Another factor which compounds this problem is the 
diversity of the electoral ecosystem in the United States, with 
elections being managed “at the state and local levels, with a 
limited federal role” [9, p. 8].   

In 2016 a White House Directive “put civilian agencies – 
not the Department of Defense – at the forefront of managing 
a  cyber  attack”  [4,  p.  32].  Pope  [4]  contends  this  directive, 
while acknowledging the “hybrid nature” [4, p. 32] of cyber 
attacks, is insufficient with addressing the issue and only led 
to a greater lack of clarity on the procedure of dealing with an 
attack.    This  climate  of  incomprehension  has  led  to  the 
formation of volunteer groups such as Election Cyber Surge 
(ECS) who work to uncover weaknesses in cyber security in 
the name of ensuring a safe and  secure voting process [10]. 
CISA  also  offers  its  services  to  evaluate  election  cyber 
security, though officials often find it difficult to make time 
for  such  a  review  during  election  season  [9].  Though 
concerned  largely  with  supply  chain  risk  management, 

 
 
Hodgson et al [9] do investigate the wider implications of a 
supply  chain  attack  and  note  that  this  lack  of  a  cohesive 
infrastructure  means  that  protecting  against  cyber  threats  is 
much more difficult, since there is little consistency between 
different regions. This indicates that cyber security is an issue 
which  needs  to  be  addressed  at  the  top,  in  order to  prevent 
vulnerabilities trickling down throughout the whole election 
process. Pope [4] takes this idea further and suggests that there 
should be a greater focus on interagency collaboration, given 
that  cyber  criminals  are  often  “transcending  borders”  [4,  p. 
27]. 

Outdated equipment is another vulnerability, one inherent 
in  elections  due  to  their  infrequent  occurrence,  as  voting 
hardware, software, and databases face periods of disuse and 
are  therefore  updated  and  maintained  less  often  than  other 
electronic systems [8]. Even if an attacker is not able to gain 
access to a machine to alter votes, the outdated systems could 
be more vulnerable to attacks that disrupt its functionality.  

Furthermore,  the  “three  largest  vendors  of  U.S.  election 
equipment”  [9,  p.  1]  all  use  parts  which  have  been  sourced 
from  Russia  and  China  rather  than  the  United  States,  and 
utilise many of the same components, meaning that a single 
attack  could  cause  exponential  problems  throughout  the 
supply chain. 

Replacing the outdated machines with newer ones has the 
benefit  of  reducing  known  vulnerabilities  but  there  is 
unintentional  negative  consequence 
in  replacing  DRE 
machines with optical scan machines – voting machines which 
accept ballots inserted into them and then  scan the ballot  to 
record  the  vote.  Although  optical  scan  machines  allow  for 
ballot  auditing,  reducing  the  risk  of  a  cyber  attack  going 
unnoticed  [1],  units  were  susceptible  to  clogging  if  a  ballot 
was dampened with hand sanitiser [11]. Due to the ongoing 
coronavirus  pandemic,  most  polling  stations  were  equipped 
with hand sanitisers to prevent the spread of the virus, which 
meant that voters whose hands were still wet with sanitising 
gel could inadvertently clog the machine or spoil their ballot. 
The problem had been noted previously, as a case in Bristol, 
VA in 2009 resulted in a machine being inoperable once it had 
received a damp ballot [12] but not compensated for, creating 
a  situation  where  the  machines  which  were  intended  to 
decrease the likelihood of incorrect votes, may have resulted 
in some individuals’ votes not being counted at all.  

A public  service announcement from  the  FBI  and  CISA 
discount  claims  election  systems  could  be  disrupted  or 
changed  in  order  to  invalidate  votes,  stating  that  even  if 
attackers held voter information, it would not prevent citizens 
from voting or be able to alter the vote [13]. They did concede, 
however, that such attacks could delay the voting process by 
“render(ing)  these  systems  temporarily  inaccessible”  [14]. 
Any  delay  in  accessing  the  voting  machines  could  result  in 
some  voters  being  unable  to  submit  their  ballot  before  the 
polling  stations  close  –  if  there  are  not  enough  alternative 
machines available - or equally could delay election officials 
from counting the votes contained within the units. While the 
machines  represent  a  physical  vulnerability  in  the  election 
system,  it  is  one  that  would  be  improved  by  tighter  policy 
controls and more frequent testing of the existing units.  

B.  Voter Fraud 

Voter fraud is a potential threat which is compounded by 
the advent of electronic voting machines [1] to the point where 
paper  ballots  remain  the  “gold  standard”  [5,  p.  18]  when  it 

comes  to  preventing  vote  tampering.  However,  despite  the 
significant  threat  posed  by  electronic  voter  fraud,  there  has 
been  little  research  into  this  subject  when  compared  with 
suppression and disinformation – a number of papers dealing 
with  voter  fraud  do  not  even  include  the  words  ‘cyber’  or 
‘online’ in relation to voter fraud [15], [6] [16]. Kiyohara [17] 
writes briefly on the subject of electronic fraud, though only 
as part of  a wider study on online voter registration (OVR). 
She notes that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to 
express concern over the potential of fraud in OVR practices 
[17], a tendency other sources also reflect [16] [18]. 

  Much  of  the  literature  surrounding  voter  fraud  focuses 
exclusively on traditional means. It is possible that this is due 
to the “dearth of evidence” [6, p. 123] of significant levels of 
fraud, but given the previously established pressure points in 
the  US’  election  infrastructure,  the  potential  for voter  fraud 
cannot be entirely disregarded. In addition, even if there is no 
proof of fraud, such allegations can affect public opinion [15] 
which leads into the topic of disinformation. 

C.  Voter Disinformation 
  A  somewhat  nebulous,  but  perhaps  widest  reaching, 
impact of cyber attacks is how they colour public perception. 
The spread  of disinformation is something of a grey area in 
terms of cyber security, as there may not be any ‘attack’ taking 
place  in  the  literal  sense,  but  the  misleading  or  false 
information must nonetheless be removed. Doing so will often 
require “interagency collaboration” [8, p. 6] and usually relies 
on the companies controlling the media platforms to step-in or 
tighten their terms of use. Many of the issues which exacerbate 
or  mitigate  voter  suppression  are  also  applicable 
to 
disinformation  campaigns.  The  diversity  of  the  electorate 
across  the US means that any disinformation  campaign  will 
prey  upon  the  most  susceptible  demographics  to  increase 
division [19]. Another similarity with voter suppression is in 
terms of response; to prevent widespread confusion, a strong 
and  swift  government  response  is  needed  to  quickly  dispel 
false  information  [19].  Pope  [4]  notes  that  any  response  to 
disinformation  must  be  a  delicate  balancing  act  between 
“counter(ing) the threat…while avoiding any influence on the 
outcome  of  the  elections”  [4,  pp.  25-26],  hence  why  the 
response  to  allegations  of  Russian  interference  in  2016  was 
somewhat  muted.  Hansen  and  Lim  [19]  argue 
that 
governments’  cyber  security  focus  is  driven  by  military 
concerns  and  thus  less  interested  devoting  resources  to  the 
social ramifications. Election officials’ limited knowledge on 
the subject  [1] seems to give tacit support to this theory. 

A Gallup poll from 2019, similarly indicated general distrust 
in  the  election  process,  with  59%  of  those  polled  did  not 
believe  the  results  of  the  election  would  be  honest,  polling 
lower than  much of Europe and substantially lower than the 
Nordic countries polled [20]. 

Whether real  or imagined, and  regardless  of  the  source, the 
climate of fear of cyber attacks has shaken many Americans’ 
confidence in the voting process, as well as the results [3]. For 
some, even producing evidence that the chance of interference 
of fraud  is  low is  not  sufficient to  prove the security  of  the 
election  and  “the  meme  of  voter  fraud”  [21,  p.  760]  is  still 
perpetuated.  In  a  Marist  Poll  [18],  47%  of  Republicans 
believed that voter fraud was the greatest risk to a “safe and 
accurate” [18, p. 11] election. Just over half of polled voters 
believed  that  President  Trump  was  actually  encouraging 
election interference, and in terms of the sample break down, 
very few groups strongly believed he was making the election 

safer. It is prudent at this juncture to note that the poll question 
only offered three response options to this topic, with the third 
being “unsure” [18, p. 10]. Therefore, the rather binary results 
may belie a more nuanced range of opinions; for example, it 
does  not  account  for  someone  believing  Trump  has  had  no 
effect, positive or negative, on the process, or that he has made 
the  election  less  safe,  but  not  necessarily  encouraged 
interference.  

On  the  flip  side  of  this  coin,  the  same  poll  indicated  that 
Democrats believed voter suppression would be the greatest 
risk  (34%),  while  Independent  voters  believed  misleading 
information was (39%), the latter risk being the highest overall 
at 35% of all polled, with voter fraud second at 24%, and voter 
suppression third at 16% [18].  

As the events of November 2020 unfolded, the true impact of 
disinformation became patently clear: no matter the proof or 
veracity, if members of the public do not believe the voting 
process to be reliable, “the actual accuracy (of the)… electoral 
results mean little” [5, p. 25].  

IV.  CONCLUSION 

Despite significant concern over the possibility of a breach 
in  cyber  security,  the  US  2020  election  was  ultimately 
unaffected  by  direct  cyber  attacks,  in  terms  the  election’s 
outcome or ballot tampering. The cyber security measures in 
place were sufficient to block or deter attackers from affecting 
the results or the voting process. Nonetheless, the volume of 
disinformation  online  and  the  climate  of  unease  posed  by 
cyber  attacks  has  had  a  considerable  effect.  While  the 
literature  may  have  differing  views  on  the  most  pressing 
issues, it is clear that the consensus is that the United States 
remains  underprepared  for,  or  at  least  underappreciative  of, 
the dangers of cyber threats. The combination of ill-informed 
officials,  widespread  disinformation,  and  poorly  maintained 
or  outdated  equipment  has  left  the  US  election  process 
vulnerable  and  without  a  more  centralised  and  rigorous 
approach  to  cyber  security,  the  United  States  remains  an 
inviting target.
