Abstract Authentication and encryption are tradition-
ally treated as two separate processes in wireless net-
works, this paper integrates user authentication into the
process of solving eavesdropping attacks. A compressed
sensing (CS)-based framework is proposed which ma-
nipulates the measurement matrix of CS to safeguard
secure computationally. The framework is also capa-
ble of continuous authentication and transmission er-
ror correction and is robust to data loss. In detail, this
paper ﬁrst proposes an algorithm to generate a 2D key
which depends on the physical property of communi-
cation channels. The 2D key is further used to gener-
ate authentication information and signal structure as
well as encrypt original data. Then an encrypted mes-
sage which contains both data and authentication in-
formation is formed for anonymous transmission. The
legal receiver can split authentication information and
data, and performing a data loss-robust and transmis-
sion error-robust authentication and recovery strategy.
The framework is evaluated quantitatively using Monte
Carlo simulation with simulated sparse signal. The se-
cure transmission performance and authentication per-
formance as well as data loss robustness are investi-
gated. This framework provides an integrated security
solution that eﬃciently safeguards the conﬁdential, pri-
vacy and robust communication in cyber-physical sys-
tems, especially in resource-limited and safety-critical
wireless networks.

1 Introduction

Modern Internet is innovating and inventing its way to
pervasive always-connected broadband services. Aim-
ing to oﬀer cyber-physical systems (CPS) which con-
nect the entire world seamlessly and ubiquitously be-
tween anybody, anything, anywhere, anytime, by what-
ever electronic devices/services/networks [35], which is
the Internet of Things (IoT) vision [19]. The pervasive
data gathering arouses big data issues. In dealing with
privacy and security concerns, authentication and en-
cryption are two enabling technologies [43]. Authentica-
tion is the process of verifying the user’s identity, which
is the prerequisite to authorization. Encryption is the
process of encoding information so that only autho-
rized parties can access it. Traditional authentication
and encryption techniques need complex key manage
scheme which cannot ﬁt with the resource-limited net-
works in IoT, e.g. wireless structural health monitor-
ing networks [31]. Physical layer security is promising
to address these concerns by exploring the character-
istic of physical attributes in cyber-physical systems.
Compared to traditional key-based authentication and
encryption, the speciﬁc physical-layer attributes are di-
rectly related to the communicating devices and the
corresponding environment, which are extremely diﬃ-
cult to impersonate. Some other issues like data loss
are crucial as well. Data loss usually happens in wire-
less sensor networks due to ill quality of wireless chan-
nel, unexpected failure, network congestion etc., which
harms data integrity. Given that IoT integrates het-
erogeneous networks, a review on techniques to han-
dle these challenges in cellular networks, wireless sensor
network, wireless body area networks etc. are given in
the next subsection.

1.1 Related Works

Physical layer security explores the characters of com-
munication entities to enable conﬁdential communica-
tion in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers. A.
Mukherjee et al. [24] conducted a survey on the prin-
ciples of physical layer security in multiuser wireless
networks. They categorize the enable technologies into
a group that dispensing with a secret key by intelli-
gent transmit coding designing [40], and a group that
exploiting the wireless medium to generate secret keys
over public channels. A review targeting at the wireless
physical layer authentication is given by [37]. Authors
divide existing physical layer authentication schemes
into channel-based and analog front end (AFE)-based.
Channel-based technologies make use of channel fea-
tures like the received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
[29] and channel state information (CSI) including chan-
nel gain [1, 11], multi-path delay [21], carrier phase [28,
41, 42], signal power spectrum density [33] etc. These
features are usually location-sensitive. A distance be-
tween adversary and legitimate user that is greater than
the half of the wavelength leads to diﬀerent CSI [21],
which is robust to spooﬁng attack. AFE-based tech-
niques explore some device-speciﬁc characteristics, which
also referred to as ﬁngerprint [34,45]. Examples includ-
ing components character such as the power ampliﬁer
and digital-to-analog converter [25], in-phase/quadrature
imbalance [12], and the carrier frequency oﬀset [14].
Compared to channel based methods, the hardware at-
tributes of transmitter need to be known by receiver in
advance. In terms of physical layer encryption, all the
above-mentioned attributes can be used to generate en-
cryption keys [24]. T. R. Dean et al. [9] explore CSI in
massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems
to generate CSI-based key. C. Liu et al. [20] propose
a location-based encryption framework. The location
can be estimated by received signal strength (RSS),
angle of arrival (AOA), time of arrival (TOA) etc. M.
Wilhelm et al. [38] use frequency-selectivity of multi-
path fading channels for key generation. A study on the
sub-carrier obfuscation is carried out under orthogo-
nal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme in
[46]. Investigation on visible light communication chan-
nel for key generation also attract some attentions [23].
Besides exploring physical attributes for key generation,
smart coding strategies also makes an important part
of physical layer encryption. These coding include polar
code [13] and precoding matrix before MIMO transmis-
sion [39] etc. There are also other initiatives on using
interference [27] or noise [17] for physical layer encryp-
tion.

All these proposals contribute to the thriving of solo
authentication or encryption on physical layer. This
paper aims to take a further leap which achieve con-
current encryption and authentication by using com-
pressed sensing (CS). E. Cand´es, J. Romberg, and T.
Tao ignite the CS in 2006 by demonstrating the ra-
tionale of CS theory from the mathematical perspec-
tive [5]. Compared to Shanon-Nyquist sampling theo-
rem, CS able to reconstruct original signals from far
fewer samples than that of Nyquist sampling rate by
ﬁnding sparse solutions to underdetermined linear sys-
tems. Sparsity, which is a prerequisite for CS, means
only a small percentage of components in a signal are
non-zeros. Since then, CS has witnessed an explosive
attention in many ﬁelds [26, 30].

CS also witnesses some applications in security en-
hancement. The widely adopted method is using the
measurement matrix in compressed sensing as an en-
cryption key [4, 8, 36], because only receivers who know
the measurement matrix can reconstruct the original
signal successfully. It is demonstrated that CS achieves
perfect secrecy under conditions if the measurement
matrix holds the restricted isometry property (RIP)
and the measurement results are more than two times of
the sparsity level while the message set does not include
the zero message [22]. Some literatures [15,16] also add
artiﬁcial noise in CS-based encryption method in coop-
erative radio systems. All these literatures are dealing
with physical layer encryption only. CS also shows po-
tential in dealing with data loss problem in wireless sen-
sor networks [7, 44, 47] due to the downsampling ability
of it.

1.2 Contributions & Paper Structure

Compared to all the related works which regard en-
cryption and authentication as separate processes, this
paper proposes a CS-based framework to perform en-
cryption and authentication concurrently from physical
layer perspective. Under this framework, the traditional
authentication before access to data mode is simpliﬁed
by concurrent authentication and encryption/secure trans-
mission, thus providing solution to deal with security
and privacy simultaneously. The framework eliminates
complex key management which means suitable for resource-
limited devices, and is capable of continuous authen-
tication because authentication information goes par-
allel with data. Besides, this framework has a certain
ability of transmission error correction and is robust
to data loss. In more detail, this paper ﬁrst proposes
an algorithm to generate a 2D key using channel gain
of time-varying channels. The 2D key working as mea-
surement matrix is further used to generate authentica-

tion information and signal structure as well as encrypt
data by compressed sensing measurement. Then an en-
crypted message which contains both data and authen-
tication information is formed for secure transmission.
The legal receiver can extract authentication informa-
tion and perform a data loss-robust and transmission
error-robust authentication and recovery strategy. Al-
though the measurement matrix is generated using the
channel gain, it is easy to transfer to other physical
attribute of CPS.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II describes the preliminaries including system model
and compressed sensing theory. Section III introduces
the proposed schemes. The performance evaluations are
given in Section IV before the conclusions in Section V.

2 PRELIMINARIES

2.1 System Model

The front-end of IoT cyber physical systems provide
compatibility with multiple wireless standards, e.g. Zig-
bee, cellular network, WiFi. The devices in same wire-
less coverage communicate with the cloud through base
station or gateway, such as the 6LowPAN standard.
This paper considers a wiretap scene in a wireless net-
work as shown in Fig. 1. A legal user communicates
with the base station with certain secure data trans-
mission schemes and both the base station and the le-
gal user need to authenticate each other. Meanwhile,
some eavesdroppers attempt to be authenticated by the
base station and eavesdrop the downlink to the legal
user. Traditional methods use pre-shared key to en-
crypt transmission data for eavesdropping attack, and
use some digital identity sequence for authentication
and spooﬁng attack. This paper investigates physical
layer attributes to generate key which eliminates the
demand of pre-shared keys and complex key manage-
ment.

Fig. 1 Typical wireless scene for cyber-physical systems. The
system suﬀers from eavesdropping attack and spooﬁng attack,
which need encryption and authentication.

We assume all wireless channels in this scene expe-
rience Rayleigh fading. Rayleigh fading is applicable for
scenes like heavily built-up city centres where there are
no line of sight between the transmitter and receiver
and many buildings and other objects attenuate, re-
ﬂect, refract, and diﬀract the signal. In this case, the
channel fading amplitude is distributed according to

p (h) =

2h
Ω

(cid:18)

exp

(cid:19)

h2
Ω

, h ≥ 0

(1)

where Ω is the mean square value of h. Note that this
is not a spotlight for this paper, one can easily transfer
to other fading channels. As a core assumption of this
paper, legal user and eavesdroppers experience diﬀer-
ent channel conditions, this is practical and common if
they located far enough apart. All users are assumed to
employ multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) tech-
niques with N channels and maximal-ratio combining
(MRC), this is a general assumption which includes
N = 1 for single antenna devices. The received sym-
bol signal can be denoted as [18],

where Ei and wi are the symbol amplitude and Gaus-
sian noise for individual channels, respectively.

2.2 Compressed Sensing

Compressed sensing enables sampling bellow Shanon-
Nyquist sampling rate based on ﬁnding sparse repre-
sentation to original signals. The overall principle of
CS is stated here.

If a signal x ∈ Rn×1 can be expanded on a basis as
Ψ ∈ Rn×n as x = Ψx(cid:48), and has only K non-zero values
(where K (cid:28) n), the signal can be measured using a
measurement matrix Φ ∈ Rm×n (where m (cid:28) n) as

y = Φx + ξ = ΦΨx(cid:48) + ξ = Ax(cid:48) + ξ

(3)

where y ∈ Rm×1 is the measurement results; A ∈ Rm×n
and the i-th column of A is denoted as Ai; ξ ∈ Rm×1 is
Gaussian noise. It is worth noting that the dimension
of measurement results is much smaller than that of the
original signal since m (cid:28) n, which means the original
signal is compressed when it is sampled.

Recovering x(cid:48) using y and A is to solve the following

optimization problem:

min
x(cid:48)

(cid:107)x(cid:48)(cid:107)(cid:96)0

subject to (cid:107)y − Ax(cid:48)(cid:107)(cid:96)2

(4)

where (cid:107)·(cid:107)(cid:96)0
denote (cid:96)0-norm and (cid:96)2-norm, re-
spectively. τ is a tolerance. Because (4) is a NP-hard

problem. It is widely accepted to substitute (cid:96)0-norm us-
ing the closest (cid:96)1-norm under some conditions like the
RIP [6] or mutual incoherence property (MIP) [10]. In
industrial process, MIP is preferred option due to lower
computation complexity than RIP [3], it is deﬁnes as,

µ = max
i(cid:54)=j

|(cid:104)Ai, Aj(cid:105)|

(5)

where (cid:104)·, ·(cid:105) is the inner product and |·| is the absolute
value function. E. J. Cand´es et al. [6] proved that 0/1-
Bernoullic matrices and independent identically distributed
Gaussian matrices guarantee sparse recovery in most
cases under measurement number constraint,

αµ2K log n ≤ m ≤ n

(6)

where α is a factor corresponding to diﬀerent instance.
This constrain means that smaller mutual incoherence
leads to fewer samples requirements. These conditions
guarantee high probability recovery using variety of re-
covery algorithms like orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)
[32].

Finally, Combining the recovered sparse signal with

the sparse basis to get x as x = Ψx(cid:48).

3 PROPOSED SCHEMES

This section introduces the proposed schemes. An over-
all diagram is given following by each block details.

3.1 Overall framework

Fig. 2 depicts the overall diagram. Firstly, the channel
gains are used to generate a 2D key (measurement ma-
trix) through a key generation process. These channel
gains can be estimated from individual MIMO chan-
nels. Secondly, the measurement matrix samples the
signal and generate authentication information (which
referred to as tag) in the concurrent data and tag trans-
mission block. This block is also responsible for hiding
tag in the measurement results of original data. Finally,
the receiver splits the tag and data, and reconstructs
the original data and authenticates the transmitter.

It is worth noting that this is a single way transmis-
sion, only the receiver can authenticate the transmitter.
In our scene, the eavesdroppers attempt to get authen-
tication by the base station, thus the transmitters are
eavesdropper and legal user for the uplinks. The base
station responses to legal receiver in the downlink to
get reverse authentication. Under this scheme, all par-
ticipants send conﬁdential information while reserving
the authentication ability. Authentication and encryp-
tion information are parallelly transmitted. This feature

provides low latency communication, because authenti-
cation and encryption are serial process in data access
traditionally.

Fig. 2 Overall diagram of the proposed concurrent encryp-
tion and authentication method.

3.2 2D key generation

As discussed in section II.B, independent identically
distributed Gaussian matrices are suitable for measure-
ment matrix in most cases. R. Dautov et al. [8] provides
a Gaussian and Bernoullic matrices generation methods
based on channel gain and m-sequence. This method is
adopted in [2, 36]. But the method requires a very long
channel gain sequences, which brings in long commu-
nication latency. Compare to [8], instead of requiring a
very long channel gain sequence, this paper relaxes it
greatly by using a random cyclical shift to a single m-
sequence, the shift value is decided by the short group
of channel gain. In this way, both transmitter and re-
ceiver saves a lot of time in channel estimation before
transmitting and authentication.

Algorithm 1 Measurement matrix generation
Input: Channel gain, h = {h1, h2, h3, ..., hL}.
1: seed = ε (h − E [h]) , where ε (·) is the unit step function.
2: Get L − 1 order power primitive polynomial.
3: Use the seed as initial value of linear feedback shift reg-
ister (LFSR) and the primitive polynomial as feedback
function to get m-sequence.

4: Add a 0 to the m-sequence to balance the number of 0

and 1, denote as m, the length is 2L.

5: Cyclically shift the new m-sequence according to h and
store every results, m. A simple shift sequence is rounding
fs(h) = (2L (cid:80)
c is cumulative sum.
The shift number is L in this case. One can ﬂip h or
even use the summation of original h and ﬂipped h as
the input for fs(·) to obtain a longer shift sequence.

c h)/ (cid:80) h, where (cid:80)

6: Sum all m to get a 2L sequence.
7: Normalize to 0∼ 1 and reshape into a matrix Φ ∈ Rm×n.
Return: measurement matrix Φ.

A detailed description of the proposed method is
given in Algorithm 1. Firstly, L channel gains are used
to generate a seed which consist of only binary values.

Then a L − 1 order power primitive polynomial is ob-
tained by consulting look-up tables or calculation. Fol-
lowed by a m-sequence (a basic pseudo-noise sequence
in CDMA) generation process which realized by linear
feedback shift register (LFSR). A ‘0’ is concatenated
to the m-sequence to balance the number of ‘0’ and ‘1’
and also to make up an even number sequence. Diﬀer-
ent from [8] which repeatedly estimates channel gains
and repeats step (1) to (4) for many times to get dif-
ferent m-sequences, this paper proposes a cyclical shift
scheme as shown in step (5). The cyclical shift scheme
is way faster than repeatedly obtaining new channel
gains, thus reducing latency. After the following steps
in Algorithm 1, a Gaussian matrix is obtained which
works as 2D key for encryption and the measurement
matrix for CS.

The cyclical shift times inﬂuence the accuracy of
generated Gaussian matrix. More shift times lead to
more accurate results. The generated Gaussian mea-
surement matrix is discrete as shown in Fig.3. With
the increasing of shift times, the discreteness becomes
less obvious. Actually, the true Gaussian distribution is
discrete because those continuous values are limited by
the storage precision of digital systems. From this per-
spective, the proposed measurement matrix generation
process can realize true Gaussian distributed matrix un-
der enough shift times.

matrix. (a) distribution after shifting L = 18 times; (b) distri-
bution after shifting 6L times; (c) true Gaussian distribution.

3.3 Concurrent data and tag transmission

The traditional CS-based encryption achieves secure
transmission by transmitting the sampled results rather
than the original data. The measurement matrix works
as a key to the original data. This paper integrates this
scenario with authentication ability.

Considering an original signal x ∈ Rn×1 samples by

the generated measurement matrix Φ ∈ Rm×n as,

y = Φx + ξ

(7)

where y ∈ Rm×1 is the weighted sum of each row in Φ
in fact, the weighting factor is x, which can be rewritten
as

(cid:88)

yi =

Φijxj + ξi

(8)

where i = {1, 2, 3, ..., m}, j = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. Then we
propose a concurrent data and tag transmission scheme.
Firstly, a tag index which only consist of ‘0’ and ‘1’ is
introduced,

ki =




1, if



0,

n
(cid:81)
j=1

(Φij − 1) = 0

otherwise

(9)

As the measurement matrix is normalized between 0
and 1, ‘1’ is the maximal value in Φ. (9) is ﬁnding rows
where the maximal values appear. Then a tag sequence
is generated according to (10)

ti = kiΦii

(10)

Some elements in Φ are chosen as the tag value. It is
obvious that the tag only related to the measurement
matrix, which related to the channel gains ultimately.
This authentication information generation process in
(9) and (10) do not have complex computation task
such as Hash function, which is easy to implement by
either hardware or software. Finally, substituting the
tag index position in measurement results as tag to ob-
tain the transmitting message as

si = yi (1 − ki)+ki

ti+

(cid:32)

m
(cid:88)

p=1

(cid:44) m
(cid:88)

yp (1 − kp)

(cid:33)

(1 − kp)

p=1

(11)

Besides substituting, this process adjusts the amplitude
of the tag sequence to the same level of the measure-
ment results, which makes eavesdroppers hard to dis-
tinguish tag positions. More robustly, the tag number
is variable. According to the Gaussian distribution, the
probability of maximal value is low, which means only
a small part of measurement results will be substituted
as tag.

After (9) to (11), the tag is hiding into the trans-
mission message. A diﬀerent measurement matrix leads
to diﬀerent substituting position, i.e., diﬀerent signal
structure. The legal user can reconstruct the original
data perfectly even only part of the measurement re-
sults are transmitted which will be discussed in the
next subsection. This means that concurrent data and
authentication information transmission is achieved.

3.4 Data recovery

As the legal user and the base station share the same
wireless channel, the receiver can obtain the same mea-
surement matrix as the transmitter, and obtain the
same tag index ki as a result. The received measure-
ment results can be extracted easily using tag index.
Unfortunately, there may be some transmitting error
in the received measurement results. Those error sym-
bols usually show up as extreme values, some ﬁltering
process can be introduced to get rid of these wrong val-
ues. Sometimes even completely loss data in some time
slots. Regardless of the reason behind data loss, the ﬁnal
received measurement results (denote as ˆy ) is a subset
(denote the subscript set as i of ground truth. (8) tell
us that every single measurement result value contains
the overall information of original signal in some degree.
The constrain for perfect recovery also gives in (6), so
the original information can be reconstructed perfectly
by using ˆy, Φi and the corresponding sparse basis Ψ as

(cid:107)ˆx(cid:107)(cid:96)0

subject to (cid:107)ˆy − ΦiΨˆx(cid:107)(cid:96)2

≤ τ

(12)

The transmission errors in the physical layer are cor-

rected, which indicates the error-correction ability.

3.5 Authentication

The legal receiver can extract the tag part using the
tag index and extract the tag ˆt as

ˆt = (cid:104)ˆs, k(cid:105) −

m
(cid:80)
p=1
= (cid:104)ˆs, k(cid:105) − E [ˆy]

yp (1 − kp)

(cid:44) m
(cid:80)
p=1

(1 − kp)

(13)

where ˆs is the received message, k is the tag index set.
Under low data loss ratio and transmission error, the
mean value of the original measurement results part in
the transmitting message is same as that of the ﬁnal re-
ceived measurement results. To authenticate the trans-
mitter, the receiver only need to compare the received
tag and the generated tag. Because the tag only con-
sists of a small part of the transmitting message, it is
too sensitive to transmission errors and data loss if use
root-mean-square error (RMSE) as cost function. We
relax it by comparing tags one-by-one and allow their
diﬀerence below certain threshold. If the identical tag
number is greater than a threshold, it is classiﬁed as au-
thenticated. The process is represented mathematically
in (14),

(cid:12)
(cid:1) > τ2Nt

(14)

Chaoqing Tang

where Nt is the tag number, τ1 and τ2 are two thresh-
olds. Under such setting, the authentication is more ro-
bust to the data loss and transmission error. The eaves-
dropper cannot know either the signal structure/tag po-
sition nor the tag numbers, not to mention tag values.

4 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The framework is evaluated in terms of secure trans-
mission performance, authentication performance and
data loss robustness because they are three major con-
cerns in this paper. Besides the assumptions in section
II, we also assume 256-QAM modulation in all links.
The advantage of using QAM is the ability to carry
more bits of information per symbol, which provides
high throughput.

4.1 Secure transmission performance

Quantitative evaluation is carried out using Monte Carlo
simulation of simulated sparse signals. This is reason-
able because a sparse decomposition block can be used
to pre-process the original data. Sparse signals with dif-
ferent sparsity level are generated for evaluation. The
signal length n = 1024, the sampling number m =
256 . Under such settings, an additional beneﬁt is that
the transmission burden reduced to 40% comparing to
transmitting the original signal, which will save power
for the transmitter. Fig. 4 shows such a signal which has
small part of random non-zeros values. The correspond-
ing transmitting message is shown in Fig. 5, where the
tags randomly hide in the message. And the tag val-
ues are in the same amplitude level as message. Note
that the tag number is variable making it more robust
to crack. Under MIMO Rayleigh fading channel and
MRC receiver as well as QAM modulation, the recov-
ered signal using OMP reconstruction method is shown
as star stems in Fig. 4. This indicates a perfect recovery,
i.e., good transmission quality. To deﬁne perfect recov-
ery, we use RMSE between the original signal and the
recovered signal and let it below certain threshold τ3,

RM SE =

(cid:114)

(cid:107)ˆx − x(cid:107)2
n

< τ3

(15)

Signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is one of the core issues
in physical layer according to Shannon equation, which
is directly related to transmission quality. As discussed
in section III.D, some ﬁltering process can be added
to the demodulated signal to get rid of wrong trans-
mission symbols which is caused by low SNR. The re-
ceiver can still perfectly recover under such case. So, the

sage information and tag information.

proposed scheme has certain degree of error correction
ability from this perspective. To investigate the inﬂu-
ence on of SNR the recovery probability, Monte Carlo
simulation is carried out to obtain the perfect recovery
probability, which is the ratio of perfect recovery num-
ber and total simulation number. All simulations are
conducted under same Rayleigh fading parameter Ω.
Complex Gaussian noise are introduced and assuming
no data loss temporarily.

diﬀerent number of MIMO channels. Sparsity level is 2%.

The inﬂuence of SNR on the recovery probability
under diﬀerent number of MIMO channels are shown
in Fig. 6. The recovery probability increases sharply af-
ter certain threshold. The corresponding theory is (6)
which indicates that perfect recovery is guaranteed if

the sampling number is large enough. While we set sam-
pling number as constant value here, the ﬁnal received
measurement results will reduce due to throwing signiﬁ-
cant wrong symbols. More MIMO channels have better
recovery probability because SNR is improved under
more MIMO channel using MRC. Besides the inﬂuence
of SNR on the ﬁnal received measurement results, the
sparsity level inﬂuences the recovery probability as well.
To eliminate the interference of SNR, we assume per-
fect transmission which means all symbols are correctly
transmitted. It is obvious that the recovery probability
decreases with the increase of sparsity. This means that
a sparser representation is helpful to the recovery prob-
ability.

4.2 Authentication performance

During the authentication process, the receiver com-
pares the extracted tag in the received signal and the
generated tag. To evaluate the authentication perfor-
mance, the authentication probability [37] is adopted as
a metric. SNR will inﬂuence the authentication proba-
bility because transmission error in tag harms the au-
thentication process. We assume no data loss here again
and the sparsity level is set as 2%. τ2 is set as 0.6 which
means 40% of tag errors are allowed. The inﬂuence
of SNR on authentication probability under diﬀerent
MIMO channels are shown in Fig. 8. Compared to Fig.
6, the authentication probability under same SNR and
MIMO channels are higher than that of recovery proba-
bility. This indicates that the authentication probabil-
ities are less sensitive to transmission errors. Because
the chance that an error symbol appears in tags are
lower than that of data in the message.

4.3 Data loss robustness

This subsection investigates the inﬂuence of data loss
ratio on both authentication performance and secure
transmission performance. Data loss ratio is the ra-
tio between the number of lost data and total sending
number. Diﬀerent percentage of data loss ratio in the
whole transmitting message are simulated under dif-
ferent MIMO channel quantity. The inﬂuence on au-
thentication probability is shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10
shows the inﬂuence on recovery probability under dif-
ferent sparsity level. Fig. 9 indicates that more than half
of authentication is successful even suﬀer from 40% of
data loss in the case of 4 MIMO channels. These curves
are less steep and the one MIMO channel curve is far
away from other curves, both observations indicate that
the authentication probability is more sensitive to SNR
than data loss. As for the inﬂuence on recovery proba-
bility, the data loss ratio which starts decreasing almost
proportional to the sparsity level, the recovery probabil-
ity decreases sharply after this ratio. These phenomena
coincide with (6). Amazingly, perfect recovery is still
guaranteed under 40% of data loss for 2% of sparsity
level, which means that the proposed scheme is robust
to data loss.

5 Conclusions

This paper proposed a compressed sensing-based frame-
work which achieves encryption and authentication con-
currently with a physical layer design for the ﬁrst time.
The framework oﬀers a well-integrated security solution
that eﬃciently safeguards the conﬁdential/privacy/robust
data communication in cyber-physical systems of Inter-
net of Things (IoT). It is beneﬁcial for safety-critical ap-

plications like telemedicine and structural health mon-
itoring. This framework contains 1) a novel 2D key
(measurement matrix) generation algorithm which is
much more time-eﬃcient than state-of-the-art methods.
It also eliminates pre-shared key and complex key man-
agement; 2) a novel authentication information gener-
ation process which eliminates complex computation;
3) a novel signal structure which concurrently transmit
data and authentication information; 4) a novel authen-
tication scheme which is robust to data loss and trans-
mission error; 5) a data recovery scheme which is able
to correct transmission error and data loss caused in the
physical layer. Although the ﬁrst three points are based
on channel gain, it is easy to transfer to other channel
state information attributes. Under this framework, the
data access latency is reduced due to encryption and
authentication fusion. Continuous authentication can
be achieved as well because authentication information
and data go parallelly.
