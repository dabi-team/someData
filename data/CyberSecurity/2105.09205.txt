Quantum secure data transfer is an important topic for quantum cyber security. We propose a
scheme to realize quantum secure data transfer in the basis of quantum secure direct communication
(QSDC). In this proposal, the transmitted data is encoded in the pulse shape of a single optical qubit,
which is emitted from a trapped atom owned by the sender and received by the receiver with another
trapped atom. The encoding process can be implemented with high ﬁdelity by controlling the time-
dependent driving pulse on the trapped atom to manipulate the Rabi frequency in accordance with
the target pulse shape of the emitted photons. In the receiving process, we prove that, the single
photon can be absorbed with arbitrary probability by selecting appropriate driving pulse. We also
show that, based on the QSDC protocol, the data transfer process is immune to the individual
attacks.

The development of large quantum computers will have dire consequences on cyber security, the security of data
transfer becomes a pressing issue, however, quantum technologies will also have positive impact on it and the protection
of data transfer is investigated by many experts and researchers[1–4]. Quantum communication provides unconditional
security in principle for exchanging information over public channel based on quantum mechanics. It is impossible to
eavesdrop without disturbing the quantum transmission. There are many protocols for quantum communication, such
as the quantum key distribution[5–7], quantum secret sharing[8], quantum telepotation[9, 10], and quantum secure
direct communication (QSDC)[11–19]. Among these protocols, QSDC can communicate information directly without
key distribution, which can further enhance the security of the quantum communication by eliminating the security
loopholes with key storage or ciphertext attacks[18, 19]. QSDC was proposed in 2000[11], and it has been realized
in the experiment by encoding the information to the photon spin states[19, 20]. The security analysis for QSDC
has been done by combining the quantum mechanics with Wyner’s wiretap channel theory[21]. The security of data
transfer can also be realized by encoding the transmitted data in the quantum state based on the protocol of QSDC.
In the quantum state transfer, the optical photons can serve as ideal ﬂying qubits at room temperature for they
having very weak coupling with the environment at room temperature[22]. Photons can carry and transmit quantum
information between diﬀerent quantum devices. Atoms are well suited for storing qubits in long-lived internal states,
the stored quantum information can be processed locally using quantum gates. Single atoms trapped in high-Q
cavities can compose a quantum device which are capable of storing, sending and receiving quantum information
which is encoded in an optical qubit[23–25]. Based on the time-reversal symmetry of the trapped atom system,
the time-dependent driving pulse can be obtained for receiving a single photon with high ﬁdelity[26–31]. The ex-
change of information between diﬀerent quantum devices can be accomplished with the ﬂying qubits of single photons
transmitted via optical ﬁbers.

In the previous experimental quantum communication protocols, the information is encoded in various degrees of
freedom such as the polarization of the photons[32], the phase of the particle[33, 34] and time-bin states[35, 36]. Here
we propose a scheme to realize quantum secure data transfer in the basis of QSDC protocol with trapped atoms.
The single photons emitted from the trapped atoms are in time-bin states. Quantum information is encoded in
the relative phase of the time bins of the single photons and there are diﬀerent pulse shapes for encoding the same
quantum information, which are used for the eavesdropping checking. The single photon pulse shape can be controlled
by the time-dependent driving pulse acting on the trapped atoms. In the absorbing process, controllable absorbing
probability can be obtained with an appropriate optimal time-dependent driving pulse based on the time-reversal
symmetry of the system.

Our model contains one atom with three energy levels which is trapped in an optical cavity. There are two ground
states |g(cid:105) and |s(cid:105) and an excited state |e(cid:105) for the trapped atom. The transition |e(cid:105) to |g(cid:105) is coupled resonantly to
the cavity mode a with a strong coupling rate g0[37–40]. The atom-cavity systems compose a quantum device for
storing and sending quantum information. First, we consider a closed system, the simpliﬁed Hamiltonian for each
atom-cavity system is HI = Ω (t) |e(cid:105)(cid:104)s| + g0|e(cid:105)(cid:104)g|ˆa + H.c. (¯h = 1), where Ω (t) is the Rabi oscillation frequency of the
transition |e(cid:105) to |s(cid:105), which is proportional to the strength of the time-dependent driving pulse to the transition |e(cid:105)
to |s(cid:105). So that, Ω(t) is tunable by varying the driving ﬁeld. ˆa is the destruction operator for cavity mode a. This
Hamiltonian has three eigenstates, one is a dark state |D(cid:105) with the eigenvelue of λD = 0, the others are bright states
0 +Ω(t)2 , in the bases of |s(cid:105)|0(cid:105), |e(cid:105)|0(cid:105) and |g(cid:105)|1(cid:105),

FIG. 1. Schematic diagram for quantum secure data transfer. The devices for both the sender and the receiver are composed of
n atom-cavity systems respectively, and the systems are one by one correspondence. The sender transmits quantum information
encoded in the single photons over the optical ﬁbers. The length of the ﬁber at the sender side is much longer than the receiver.
The two sides can also communicate with a classical channel for eavesdropping checking.

where |0(cid:105) and |1(cid:105) represent the zero- and the one-photon state of the cavity mode a respectively, the dark state is

|D(cid:105) = − cos θ(t)|g(cid:105)|1(cid:105) + sin θ(t)|s(cid:105)|0(cid:105).

(1)

Assume that, the wave function of the closed system is ψ(t) = c1(t)|s(cid:105)|0(cid:105) + c2(t)|e(cid:105)|0(cid:105) + c3(t)|g(cid:105)|1(cid:105).

Initially,
if the system is in state |s(cid:105)|0(cid:105) or |g(cid:105)|1(cid:105), in the adiabatic process, the system will evolve in the dark state, which
means that c2(t) = 0 in the whole process.
In the bases of |D(cid:105), |B+(cid:105) and |B−(cid:105), the wave function is ψ(t) =
cD(t)|D(cid:105) + cB+(t)|B+(cid:105) + cB−(t)|B−(cid:105), initially, if the system is in state |D(cid:105), under the adiabatic approximation, there
will be cB+(t) = 0 and cB−(t) = 0.

system, c3(t) = (cid:104)ˆa(t)(cid:105), then we can get the output pulse as (cid:104)ˆaout(t)(cid:105) = −
where θ(t) is a function of Ω(t). Using the optimization method, for every target output single photon pulse shape
(cid:104)ˆaout (t)(cid:105), we can ﬁnd a corresponding Ω (t) /g0.

Apart from Ω(t), the coupling strength g0 will also produce an eﬀect on the ﬁdelity of the whole process. In diﬀerent
cases of g0, c1 (t), c2 (t) and c3 (t) can be calculated by substituting Ω(t) and g0 into the equation ˙(cid:126)v = −iM(cid:126)v, where
(cid:126)v = [c1(t), c2(t), c3(t)]T and M = [0, Ω(t), 0; Ω(t), 0, g0; 0, g0, − iκ
2 ]. The optimization and numerical simulation results
for the output process is shown in Figure 2.

We can prove that, this system is time-reversible symmetric (see Appendix B for more details). With the strong
coupling between the atom and the cavity, the input and output process is reversible.
In the absorbing process,
initially, the system is in state |g(cid:105)|0(cid:105). If the target input function is fa(t) (t ∈ [0, T ]), we can get the time-dependent
Rabi frequency in the absorbing process by doing as follow.

First, we can assume that, the system is in state |s(cid:105)|0(cid:105). And then, optimize the output process with a target output
pulse function fa(T − t) and getting an optimized result for Ω(t)/g0. Finally, we can absorb an input pulse fa(t)
with Ω(T − t)/g0. Assume that, following these steps, the ratio of the Rabi frequency over g0, which we ﬁnd in the
absorbing process, is Ωa(t)/g0.

Under the adiabatic approximation, in the absorbing process, the system will stay in the dark state. The de-

This system can be used to realize quantum secure state transfer. The quantum devices for both sender and receiver
are composed of n trapped atoms. Here, we assume that, the ﬁber used to transmit the single photon is lossless.
There are four diﬀerent pulse shapes fj(t) (j = α, β, γ, µ and t ∈ [0, nT ] and n > 1) for a single photon used in the
quantum data transfer, which are shown in ﬁgure 4(a) and (b). For simplicity, we assume fj(t) is real. fα and fγ
are used to transmit the information 1, the others are used as the information 0. The four types of pulse satisfy

FIG. 4. Numerical simulation results for the quantum secure data transfer process. (a) and (b) are four types of single photon
pulse shapes used in the quantum information transfer. (c) to (j) show the process of absorbing a single photon by the receiver.
Pij is the process of absorbing a single photon with pulse shape fi(t) with a time-dependent Rabi frequency Ωj(t). For the
processes Pαα, Pγα, Pββ and Pµα, during time t ∈ (T, (n − 1)T ), there is 50% probability to absorb a single photon. While for
the processes Pβα, Pµα, Pαβ and Pγα, during time t ∈ (T, (n − 1)T ), there is only 25% probability to absorb a single photon.
For the processes Pαα and Pββ, at time t = nT , there is unit probability to absorb a single photon, and the receiver can receive
the information of 1. For the processes Pγα and Pµβ, at time t = nT , there is no probability to absorb a single photon, and
the receiver can receive the information of 0.

Step 1. The atom-cavity systems belonging to S are initialized to state |s(cid:105)|0(cid:105) and which for R are initialized to

state |g(cid:105)|0(cid:105). The S and R’s atom-cavity systems are one-to-one correspondence.

Step 2. If the data sending from S to R is 1 (0), we can apply an optimized driving pulse on the atom of S to
produce a single photon with pulse shape fα(t) (fγ(t)) or fβ(t) (fµ(t)), and transmitted to R. When the front end of
the single photon pulse arrives at R, the time is marked as t = 0. At this time, S just ﬁnishes the emitting, the single
photon is totally in the optical ﬁber with certain pulse shape.

Step 3. The single photon can be received by applying a time-dependent driving pulse to produce a corresponding
Rabi frequency, which is chosen randomly only from Ωα(t) and Ωβ(t) by R. If S send fα(t) (fβ(t)) or fγ(t) (fµ(t)) to
R, R chooses Ωα(t) (Ωβ) to receive the photon, then the choice is right, if not, it is wrong.

Step 4. After t = T , R chooses m (m < n) atoms randomly to detect the states of these atoms, and will get 0 (if

the atom is in state |g(cid:105)) or 1 (if the atom is in state |s(cid:105)).

Step 5. Eavesdropping checking: R and S communicate with classical channel for which time-dependent Rabi
frequency R chooses for all the trapped atoms and which atoms are chosen to measure and the measurement results.
For the m atoms, if R chooses the right driving pulse, the result is marked as type r, if R didn’t choose the right
driving pulse, the result is marked as type nr. In type r, if the probability for R getting 1 is 50%, and in type nr, the
probability for R getting 1 is 25%, the quantum communication is safe, If not, S should stop all the sending processes
immediately.

If the quantum state transfer is safe, S will do nothing with the processes for the atoms which R chooses the right

5

driving pulse and the later part of these single photon pulses will be continued to send to R, the number of which
is marked as q. For the processes which R chooses wrong driving pulses in the n − m atoms, S stops the sending
processes and tell R which ones they are. When this checking process is ﬁnished, we mark the time as tr. There are
redundant optical ﬁber in S side, which should make sure that, the transmission time of the photon in S side is longer
than tr + T , so that, at time t = tr, the later part of the single photons are still under control of S, and S can choose
to detect the later part of the single photons to stop sending, there isn’t any information sent out from S before time
tr. If the sending and receiving are bidirectional, there should also be redundant length of optical ﬁber in R side to
make sure the later part of the single photons are still under control at the end of the eavesdropping checking process,
it is possible for R to transfer quantum states to S securely.

Step 6. After R receives all q photons with right driving pulses and detects the states of the q trapped atoms, he

can get the transferred information.

If there is eavesdropping after the eavesdropping checking, the state of the eavesdropper’s trapped atoms is random

and he will get nothing.

In this proposal, we encoded the quantum information in the pulse shape and the phase of single photons to realize
the quantum secure data transfer in the basis of QSDC protocol. In the emitting process, the optimal time-dependent
In the
Rabi frequency to produce a single photon with arbitrary pulse shape can be realized with high ﬁdelity.
absorbing process, the relationship between the time-dependent Rabi frequency and the absorbing probability for
a certain input photon pulse was calculated. With this method, a single photon can be absorbed with arbitrary
probability by using the corresponding time-dependent Rabi frequency. We prove that, the quantum secure data
transfer can be implemented with the atom-cavity systems.

In the basis of |D(cid:105), |B+(cid:105) and |B−(cid:105), the conditional Hamiltonian can be written as

Appendix B: The time-reversible symmetry of the system

For a closed system, in the basis of |s(cid:105)|0(cid:105), |e(cid:105)|0(cid:105) and |g(cid:105)|1(cid:105), the wave function of the system is ψ (t) = c1 (t) |s(cid:105)|0(cid:105) +

c2 (t) |e(cid:105)|0(cid:105) + c3 (t) |g(cid:105)|1(cid:105), applying the systematic Hamiltonian to the schr¨odinger equation i ∂
can get

i ˙c1 (t) = Ω (t) c2 (t)

If in the input process, (cid:104)ˆain(t)(cid:105) and Ω(t) are the time reversal of the output process, the phase diﬀerence of Ω(t)
and g0 between the input and output processes are π
2 and the initial state of the input process equals the ﬁnal state
of the output process, ci(t) (i = 1, 2, 3) will also be the time reversal of the output process. In this model, the phase
diﬀerence of Ω(t) and g0 between the input and output processes will not aﬀect the value of |ci(t)|, so that, in our
scheme, Ω(t) and g0 in the input process can be in phase with the output process.

This system has time-reversible symmetry.

Now, we talk abort the process of absorbing a single photon with pulse shape fa(t) (t ∈ [0, T ]) by using the driving

pulse Ωa(t), and the probability of absorbing a single photon at time t = T is 1.

At time t = 0, there is J(T, 0) = a(cid:63)
Assume that, before a certain time tc, there is J(T, t(cid:48)) = a(cid:63)
