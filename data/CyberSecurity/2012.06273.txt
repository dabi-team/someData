Abstract—Motivated by recent security issues in cyber-physical
systems, this technical note studies the stabilization problem of
networked control systems under Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
In particular, we consider to stabilize a nonlinear system with
limited data rate via linearization. We employ a deterministic
DoS attack model constrained in terms of attacks’ frequency and
duration, allowing us to cover a large class of potential attacks. To
achieve asymptotic stabilization, we propose a resilient dynamic
quantizer in the sense that it does not saturate in the presence
of packet losses caused by DoS attacks. A sufﬁcient condition for
stability is derived by restricting the average DoS frequency and
duration. In addition, because of the locality of linearization, we
explicitly investigate an estimate of the region of attraction, which
can be expected to be reduced depending on the strength of DoS
attacks. A simulation example is presented for demonstration of
our results.

I. INTRODUCTION

Networked control systems have been widely studied over
the past several decades [1]. In recent years, cyber security of
such systems has attracted much attention as the communi-
cation channels are exposed to malicious attackers; see, e.g.,
[2] and [3] for an overview. It has become clear that cyber
attacks to control systems may induce critical incidents in the
real world, resulting in, e.g., physical damages in equipments
and ﬁnancial losses. The authors of [4] classiﬁed cyber attacks
on control systems into deception attacks, which are conducted
by changing the contents of packet data, and Denial-of-Service
(DoS) attacks, which refer to communication interruptions
including jamming attacks. DoS attacks are particularly critical
as it is easier to launch than deception attacks as mentioned
in [5]. For this reason, we examine the effects of DoS attacks
in this paper.

Since it is not rational to assume that malicious attacks
follow a certain probability distribution, we treat DoS attacks
in a deterministic manner rather than a stochastic one; see the
survey paper [6] for more detailed discussions on various DoS
attack models. A characterization of deterministic DoS attacks
in terms of average frequency and duration was introduced by

[7], and is also used in this paper. In that paper, allowable DoS
frequency and duration to guarantee input-to-state stability of
linear systems were obtained. These conditions were made
less conservative in [8] by using a predictor that estimates
interrupted measurements. On the other hand, global stability
of nonlinear systems under DoS attacks was investigated in [9].
In contrast, the paper [10] provided a comprehensive treatment
of both malicious and non-malicious packet losses. A switched
system framework was also studied in [11].

On the other hand, data rate limitation of communication
channels is one of the important issues in networked control
systems [12]. In this context, information to be exchanged over
communication networks must be quantized. Many researchers
have explored a range of quantized control problems from var-
ious perspectives; see, e.g., [13] and the references therein. For
considering asymptotic stabilization under the required data
rate, we employ time-varying quantizers with the zooming-
in and zooming-out capabilities proposed by [14]. However,
packet losses may induce saturation of the dynamic quantizer,
since its quantization region becomes small as time passes.
To avoid such situations, we propose the resilient design that
expands the quantization region depending on the occurrence
of DoS attacks. Recently, observer-based quantized control
under DoS attacks was considered in [15]. In [16], the trade-
off between the minimum data rate for stabilization and the
tolerable level of DoS attacks was revealed. Furthermore, the
minimum data rate problem in the presence of probabilistic
packet losses has been addressed in [17] and [18]. These
results are applicable to linear systems but not to nonlinear
systems. In this paper, we consider quantized control of
nonlinear systems via linearization as studied in [19].

Though linearization-based control is a typical method in
practice,
the effects of DoS attacks have not been much
explored in the literature. It is of particular interest in the
context of DoS attacks, since they may bring critical issues
when communication is interrupted. Indeed, if the state leaves
the region of attraction due to DoS attacks, then it will not con-
verge to the equilibrium point even after the communication
is restored. In [20], a linearization approach was analyzed and
an estimate of the region of attraction under DoS attacks was
derived. This paper provides an extension of the framework
presented there to take quantization effects into account.

The subsequent sections are organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II, we describe the problem setting and the DoS attack
model used in this paper. The encoding/decoding scheme
and the proposed resilient dynamic quantizer are introduced
in Section III. The main results of this paper are presented
in Section IV, where a sufﬁcient condition for stability and

an initial condition to guarantee the convergence of state
trajectories are derived. In Section V, we present a simulation
example. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section VI. The
preliminary version of this paper appeared as [21]. The current
paper contains full proofs of the results.

Throughout this paper, we employ the following notation.
The sets of nonnegative reals and nonnegative integers are
denoted by R+ and Z+, respectively. Given a vector v and
a matrix M , kvk∞ and kM k∞ respectively denote the ∞-
norm and the induced ∞-norm. The length of an interval I is
denoted by |I|.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

In this section, we describe the problem setting of networked
control and the DoS attack model characterized by their
frequency and duration.

A. Nonlinear Networked Control System

Consider the nonlinear networked control system depicted
in Fig. 1, where a communication channel is inserted between
the sensor and the controller. Here, the plant to be controlled
is described by

˙x(t) = f (x(t), u(t)),

t ≥ 0,

(1)

where x(t) ∈ Rn is the state and u(t) ∈ Rm is the control
input at time t. The initial state is given by x(0) = x0 ∈ Rn.
Assume that f : Rn × Rm → Rn is continuously differentiable
and that the system (1) has an equilibrium point at the origin,
i.e., f (0, 0) = 0. Then, we impose the following assumption.
Assumption 1: The function f in (1) is Lipschitz in a certain
region D := {x ∈ Rn : kxk∞ < ̺} for any input u ∈ Rm,
where ̺ > 0 is some positive number. That is, there is a
constant L ≥ 0 satisfying kf (y, u) − f (z, u)k∞ ≤ Lky − zk∞
for all y, z ∈ D and u ∈ Rm.

Letting T > 0 be a ﬁxed sampling period, we denote by
tk := kT , k ∈ Z+, the sampling instants. The ideal sampler
ST measures the state at each sampling time. The sampled
state is then transformed by the encoder Ek into a certain
symbol to be sent through the communication channel. At the
controller side, the decoder Dk produces the quantized state
after receiving the packet as explained in the next section.
During the sampling/transmission intervals, the control input
is kept constant by the zeroth-order hold HT .

For given vectors ¯x ∈ Rn and ¯u ∈ Rm, let φ(t, ¯x, ¯u) be
the solution to (1) for t ∈ [0, T ] with the initial state x0 = ¯x
and the constant input u(t) ≡ ¯u. Then, we deﬁne φT (¯x, ¯u) :=
φ(T, ¯x, ¯u). Furthermore, for ease of presentation, we write the

2

sampled value x(tk) as xk for each k ∈ Z+, and the same
notation is used for other variables as well.

If a DoS attack is active at a sampling time, then the packet
transmission at that instant fails. In this case, the control input
is set to zero until the next packet reaches the controller side.
Let θk ∈ {0, 1} be the indicator that stands for the absence or
presence of packet losses. If a packet loss occurs at time tk,
we set θk = 1, and otherwise θk = 0. Then, the control input
applied to the plant (1) is given as follows:

u(t) = (1 − θk)Kqk,

t ∈ [tk, tk+1),

k ∈ Z+,

(2)

where K ∈ Rm×n is a feedback gain matrix, the choice of
which is given later. Moreover, qk ∈ Rn denotes the quantized
value of the sampled state xk.

B. Data Rate Limitation

Since we consider a communication channel whose data
rate is limited, the information that the packet can contain
is taken from a ﬁnite set. Let M := {0, 1, . . . , M n − 1} be
the set of integers that can be sent by communication at each
transformation, where M is a positive integer expressing the
number of the quantization levels in one coordinate of Rn.
In this case, the data rate of the channel is denoted by R :=
n log2(M )/T bits per unit of time. Deﬁning Λ := eLT , in
what follows, we make the assumption below.

Assumption 2: The number of the quantization levels M

satisﬁes M > Λ.

Remark 1: The above condition can be found in [14], and
it is sufﬁcient to stabilize the nonlinear system (1) if there
is no packet loss. Thus, the conservativeness of the data rate
condition is the same as that in [14], although DoS attacks are
considered. Note that, for linear systems, one can reduce the
data rate condition using a certain coordinate transformation
as considered in [15], [16]. However, for nonlinear systems,
it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd such a transformation. Although local
asymptotic stability can be preserved under a data rate which
is arbitrarily close to the minimum data rate for the linearized
system [22], it is not practically enough from the viewpoint
of, e.g., the region of attraction. Because we quantitatively
explore the region of attraction in the subsequent section, the
above assumption on the data rate is employed.

C. Averagely Constrained DoS Attacks

Here, we introduce a deterministic class of DoS attacks. For
i ∈ Z+, let ai ≥ 0 and τi ≥ 0 denote the launching time and
the length of the ith DoS attack, respectively. Notice that when
τi = 0, the attack is impulsive, and thus, it has no length. We
then deﬁne the collection of DoS attack intervals by

A(t) :=

[ai, ai + τi] ∩ [0, t].

[i∈Z+

Furthermore, we denote by N (t) the number of DoS attacks
for which the starting time is inside the interval [0, t]. Follow-
ing the work of [7], we characterize DoS attacks in terms of
their frequency and duration.

Assumption 3 (DoS frequency): There exist constants κF ≥

0 and ρF ∈ [0, ∞) such that

N (t) ≤ κF + ρF t,

t ≥ 0.

Assumption 4 (DoS duration): There exist constants κD ≥ 0

and ρD ∈ [0, 1) such that

and g(x, u) := f (x, u) − Ax − Bu is the remainder term of
the linear approximation. Assume that A is unstable and that
the pair (A, B) is stabilizable.

Then, we discretize the continuous-time system (3) with

sampling period T to obtain

xk+1 =

Axk +

Buk +

g(xk, uk),

(4)

3

|A(t)| ≤ κD + ρDt,

t ≥ 0.

where

A := eAT ,

In the above assumptions, the constants ρF and ρD repre-
sent the allowable average frequencies and durations of DoS
attacks. On the other hand, the constants κF and κD indicate
the initial energy to launch attacks. In this framework, an
attacker does not need to follow certain attack strategies such
as periodic attacks. Note that an attacker can launch frequent
but short DoS attacks to cause packet losses at all transmission
times. Such situations may occur when ρF ≥ 1/T is allowed,
under which DoS attacks can be sufﬁciently frequent compared
with the transmission period. This implies that periodic com-
munications are vulnerable as the transmission time instants
are available for attackers. To make the communication more
secure, randomized transmission protocols are proposed by
[23] in the context of multi-agent consensus problems.

Remark 2: In [7], [8], more restrictive class of DoS attacks
is considered. There, the frequencies and the durations of
DoS attacks are constrained for any time intervals [τ, t] with
τ ≤ t rather than [0, t]. Note that such assumptions are
required to guarantee input-to-state stability with respect to
disturbances [7] or to construct a state predictor [8]. In
particular, the DoS model considered in [7], [8] has an upper
bound on the consecutive packet losses. In contrast, we do
not assume consecutive packet losses to be bounded. We also
note that the DoS parameters are determined depending on the
attacker’s resource. As the attacker’s power is time-varying,
these parameters can be time dependent in general. However,
the control parameters are ﬁxed in this paper, and hence, we
only consider the constant DoS parameters. If one employs
adaptive or switching control strategies whose parameters are
changed depending on the attack level in real time, then there
is an advantage to estimate the DoS parameters on-line.

III. QUANTIZED CONTROL VIA LINEARIZATION
In this section, we consider to stabilize the nonlinear system
(1) via linearization. First, we explore the inter-sample behav-
ior and the vanishing perturbation property of the remainder
term of linearization. Then, the encoding and decoding proce-
dures are explained, followed by proposing a resilient dynamic
quantizer design.

A. Linearization Analysis

is not guaranteed due to linearization, which is important in
the context of networked control under DoS attacks.

Whereas [15] considers discrete-time systems, we employ
the sampled-data setting as bounds on the inter-sample behav-
ior are required to analyze the plant nonlinearity. We now
deﬁne c0 := [1 + T (kBKk∞ + kKk∞)]eT (kAk∞+1) and
c1 := eT (kAk∞+1). The following lemma is useful to examine
bounds on the nonlinear term in (4).

Lemma 1: For any ¯x ∈ Rn, consider the solution φ(t, ¯x, ¯u)
to (1) with ¯u = (1 − θ)K ¯x, where θ ∈ {0, 1}. Then, there
exists a constant d > 0 such that k¯xk∞ < d implies for all
t ∈ [0, T ),

kφ(t, ¯x, ¯u)k∞ ≤

c0k¯xk∞ if θ = 0,
c1k¯xk∞ if θ = 1.

(

Proof: See Appendix A.

To explore local stability of the origin, we need bounds on
the remainder term of linearization. Given γ > 0, we deﬁne
γ0 := (c0 +kKk∞)γT eT kAk∞ and γ1 := c1γT eT kAk∞. In the
following lemma, we give the region inside which the growth
of the effects of the plant nonlinearity is characterized in terms
of the state norm.

Lemma 2: For any ¯x ∈ Rn, consider the nonlinear function
g(¯x, ¯u) in (4) with ¯u = (1 − θ)K ¯x, where θ ∈ {0, 1}. Then,
for every γ > 0, there exists a constant δ ∈ (0, d] such that

B. Encoding/Decoding Scheme

Due to the limited data rate, we consider a ﬁnite number
of partitions of the quantization region. In this subsection, we
state the encoding/decoding scheme of the dynamic quantizer
following [14]. We consider the encoder and the decoder
which have two time-dependent variables: the center of the
quantization region and the radius of the quantization range.
We denote these variables with the symbols ξk ∈ Rn and

Algorithm 1 Encoding process
Input: Sampled state measurement xk ∈ Q(ξk, Ek).
Output: Encoded symbol i ∈ M.

The quantization region Q(ξk, Ek) is partitioned into the
M n equal boxes with the same dimension, each of which
is indexed by an integer in M.
for k ∈ Z+ do

Encode xk into the symbol i associated with the partition
in which xk lies.
Send the symbol i to the decoder.
Receive an acknowledgement θk ∈ {0, 1} from the
decoder.
Update ξk and Ek based on the value of θk by the rules
(7) and (8).

end for

Algorithm 2 Decoding process
Input: Encoded symbol i ∈ M.
Output: Quantized state measurement qk ∈ Rn.

The decoder knows which symbol i ∈ M corresponds to
which partition of Q(ξk, Ek).
for k ∈ Z+ do

if if the decoder receives the packet at time tk then

Set qk as the center ξk of the partition associated with
the received symbol i.
Send the acknowledgement θk = 0 to the encoder.

else

Set qk to zero.
Send the acknowledgement θk = 1 to the encoder.

end if
Update ξk and Ek based on the value of θk by the rules
(7) and (8).

end for

Ek ≥ 0, respectively. Now, we deﬁne the quantization region
at time tk as follows:

Q(ξk, Ek) := {x ∈ Rn : kx − ξkk∞ ≤ Ek}.

This is a hypercube which has the edges of length 2Ek and is
centered at ξk, and this region must be the same in both the
encoder and the decoder at each time. Since the initial state
is not known exactly in general, we set ξ0 = 0. For E0, we
make the following assumption, under which the encoder and
the decoder know how far the state is from the origin.

Assumption 5: We set E0 ≥ 0 such that the initial state x0

of (1) satisﬁes kx0k∞ ≤ E0.

To avoid saturation of the quantizer, ξk and Ek are adjusted
based on the reachable set of state trajectories. In this paper,
we assume that an acknowledgement signal or the value of θk
is exchanged between the encoder and decoder and that this
signal is not subject to DoS attacks similarly to [15] and [16].
In practice, this assumption is unrealistic. However, one can
estimate the occurrence of packet losses from the behavior of
the state without acknowledgements as considered in [24].

The encoding and decoding processes are described in
Algorithms 1 and 2, respectively. If we know which partitioned
box the state lies in, then the reachable set at the next sampling

4

instant can be estimated so that
it becomes smaller than
the current quantization region, resulting in the zooming-in
process. However, if the packet loss occurs at time tk, we know
only that the state xk is inside Q(ξk, Ek). Hence, one needs
to expand the quantization region to capture the state xk+1
at the next sampling time tk+1, leading to the zooming-out
process. In the next subsection, we explain how the quantizer
is updated depending on the value of θk while the effects of
DoS attacks are taken into account.

C. Resilient Dynamic Quantizer Design

Suppose now that the sampled state xk lies in the quantiza-
tion region Q(ξk, Ek), which is equivalent to kxk − ξkk∞ ≤
Ek. Recall from the quantization procedure mentioned above,
qk is the center of the partitioned box in which xk lies. Thus,
we know that the quantization error satisﬁes

kxk − qkk∞ ≤

1
M

Ek.

(5)

To avoid saturation of the quantizer, i.e., to ensure that the state
never goes outside the quantization region, both the encoder
and decoder need to calculate ξk+1 and Ek+1 so that the
following inequality holds:

kxk+1 − ξk+1k∞ ≤ Ek+1,

(6)

which is equivalent to xk+1 ∈ Q(ξk+1, Ek+1).

To do so, we propose the following update rules: At each
sampling time tk, the encoder and decoder generate ξk+1 and
Ek+1 by

ξk+1 :=

(

Ek+1 :=

if θk = 0,
if θk = 1,

φT (ξk, 0)
Λ
M
ΛEk

Ek

if θk = 0,

if θk = 1.

(7)

(8)



The zooming-in/out process depends on some variables.
First, ξk is updated to trace the state trajectory by estimating
the reachable set at time tk+1. This process is conducted by
simulating the nonlinear system model. Since our main focus
is local stabilization via linearization-based control, we do not
consider the computational complexity. Second, Ek is updated
to cover the uncertainty on the estimate of the reachable set.
Such uncertainty can be known from the Lipschitz property
of the system (1), which is assumed in Assumption 1. In
particular, the quantization level M must large enough such
that the trajectory remains in the quantization region. If there
are some uncertainties such as unmodeled dynamics and
computation errors, then one can modify the zooming rate
in (8) to avoid the saturation of the quantizer.

The quantizer needs to be capable to expand its quantization
range when packet losses occur. In what follows, we show that
the dynamic quantizer with (7) and (8) locally satisﬁes the
condition (6) at times when both zooming-in and zooming-
out occur.

1) Zooming-In Process: We ﬁrst consider the case where
the packet transmission at time tk is successful, that is, θk = 0.
In this case, the quantized state qk is available for both the
encoder and decoder. Note that from the Lipschitz condition
in Assumption 1, kφT (x, u) − φT (y, u)k∞ ≤ eLT kx − yk∞.
Hence, if xk, qk ∈ D, where D is given in Assumption 1, then
we can see from (7) that

kxk+1 − ξk+1k∞ = kφT (xk, Kqk) − φT (qk, Kqk)k∞

≤ Λkxk − qkk∞ ≤

Λ
M

Ek,

where the last inequality follows from the boundary condition
(5). Hence, by (8), we can guarantee the condition (6). We note
that, under Assumption 2, the quantization region becomes
smaller in the absence of DoS attacks.

2) Zooming-Out Process: We then consider the case where
the communication fails at time tk due to DoS attacks, that is,
θk = 1. In this case, the decoder does not know the value of
qk but knows that of ξk, and thus, the update rule (7) can be
performed. Whenever xk, qk ∈ D, we have

kxk+1 − ξk+1k∞ = kφT (xk, 0) − φT (ξk, 0)k∞

≤ Λkxk − ξkk∞ ≤ ΛEk.

Therefore, the update rules (7) and (8) can be used to ensure
that (6) holds. Notice that the quantization range becomes
larger since Λ > 1. This also indicates that DoS attacks induce
the expansion of the quantization region.

In [14], the zooming-out process is used when the initial
state is unknown. In contrast, our update rule is needed to
absorb the effects of DoS attacks. Moreover, differently from
stochastic packet losses, an attacker can launch long DoS
attacks to block packet transmissions consecutively. In our
framework, such DoS attacks are constrained by Assump-
tions 3 and 4.

IV. MAIN RESULTS

In this section, we consider stability analysis of the non-
linear system (1) with the control input (2). Furthermore, we
provide the initial condition to guarantee the convergence of
state trajectories.

A. Characterization of Switched Lyapunov Function

Various ways to analyze asymptotic stability of switched
systems with quantization have been considered such as
a switched Lyapunov function approach [25] and a com-
mon Lyapunov function approach [26]. Differently from the
aforementioned papers, we consider both stable and unstable
modes. To handle unstable dynamics, we employ a slightly
different technique that captures the system’s behavior within
the Lyapunov framework. Furthermore, we deal with nonlin-
earity of the plant, which affects the increase and decrease
rates of a Lyapunov function in a certain region.

Take ϕ0 ∈ (0, 1) and ϕ1 ∈ (1, ∞) to be scalars with which
A are Schur stable, respectively.

We here note that there always exists a common matrix P =

P0 = P1 if the constant ϕ1 are large enough. However, more
preferable stability condition can be obtained by allowing the
use of distinct P0 and P1. Following the work of [25], we
deﬁne for p ∈ {0, 1} the positive deﬁnite function Wp : Rn ×
R+ → R+ as follows:

Wp(ξ, E) := ξ

T

Ppξ + ηpE2,

ξ ∈ Rn, E ≥ 0,

(11)

where η0, η1 > 0 are sufﬁciently large numbers. These
functions satisfy the following two properties. First, there exist
α, β > 0 such that for every p ∈ {0, 1},

α(kξk∞ + E)2 ≤ Wp(ξ, E) ≤ β(kξk∞ + E)2.

(12)

Second, there exist µ0, µ1 ≥ 1 such that

W1(ξ, E) ≤ µ0W0(ξ, E), W0(ξ, E) ≤ µ1W1(ξ, E).

(13)

These properties are not difﬁcult to verify. For example, to
satisfy the ﬁrst property, we can use

(15)

Compared with [25], where the same Lyapunov-like func-
tions are employed to analyze stability of linear switched
systems, we consider nonlinear switched systems. Moreover,
the switching conditions are different.

Remark 3: Here, we explain the difference from the analysis
of our previous work [20]. The functions in (11) are composed
of two parts: The ﬁrst part corresponds to the classical
quadratic Lyapunov function and was used in [20] for stability
analysis. Here, in addition, we have the second part related to
the quantization error. If one employs the dynamic quantizer as
explained in the previous section, then the quantization error
is expected to converge to zero. Therefore, by adding the error
term, one can utilize (11) as a Lyapunov function.

The function Wθk (ξk, Ek) decreases under the nominal
operation, whereas it increases under DoS attacks. We now
provide the convergence and divergence rates of this function
depending on the occurrence of packet losses. Let

ν0 := max{ϕ0, Λ2/M 2},
ν1 := max{ϕ1, Λ2}.

(16)

(17)

Then, the following lemma gives a local characterization of
the switched Lyapunov-like function Wθk (ξk, Ek). Now, in
Lemma 2, we choose γ > 0 sufﬁciently small such that δ < ̺.
Lemma 3: Consider the nonlinear system (1) with (2) as
well as the dynamic quantizer (7) and (8). Suppose that
Assumptions 1–5 hold. Then, there exist ω0 ∈ [ν0, 1) and
ω1 ∈ [ν1, ∞) such that kξkk∞ + Ek ≤ δ implies

Wθk+1 (ξk+1, Ek+1) ≤

where µ0 and µ1 are as in (13), and δ ∈ (0, ̺) is given in
Lemma 2.

Proof: See Appendix C.

Remark 4: The convergence and divergence rates ω0 and ω1
partly depend on the data rate of the communication channel.
However, if the data rate is sufﬁciently large, then ω0 and
ω1 converge to that of the inﬁnite data rate case, which
is determined only by the dynamics of the plant (1). This
property is the same as those of [25]. In this case, we can
recover our previous results presented in [20]. Furthermore, we
have restricted ourselves to the case where the control input
is reset to zero under DoS attacks. In this setting, it is not
difﬁcult to characterize the divergence rate under DoS attacks
(see (10)). We note that other control settings such as hold-
input strategy [7], [9] and output feedback [15] may be useful
in practice. A similar analysis to this paper can be carried
out although the characterization of a Lyapunov function as in
(18) becomes more complicated.

B. Stability Condition Under DoS Attacks

Now, we are ready to state our main result. Let κ∗

D :=
κD + κF T and ρ∗
D := ρD + ρF T . The following theorem
extends the result of [20] to the case where quantization needs
to be considered.

Thoerem 1: Consider the nonlinear networked control sys-
tem (1) with the control input (2). Suppose that Assump-
tions 1–5 hold. If

ρF T ln µ0µ1 + (1 − ρ∗

D) ln ν0 + ρ∗

D ln ν1 < 0,

(19)

then the origin is locally asymptotically stable.

Proof: Let χ(t) be the number of unsuccessful packet
[0, t]. Using

transmissions that occur in the time interval
Assumptions 3 and 4, we obtain
D + ρ∗
κ∗
T

χ(t) ≤

.

Since the quantizer does not saturate, i.e., (6) holds, we have

kxkk∞ ≤ kξkk∞ + Ek.
If kξkk∞ + Ek ≤ δ holds for all k ∈ Z+, then we obtain from
Lemma 3 that

Wθk (ξk, Ek) ≤ (µ0µ1)N (tk)ωk−χ(tk)

1 . From the choice of ω0 and ω1
respectively given by (24) and (26) in the proof of Lemma 3,
there always exists δ in Lemma 3 such that ω0 and ω1 are
arbitrarily close to ν0 and ν1, respectively. The condition (19)
thus implies that ω < 1 holds in a certain small region, that
is, small δ. Next, we need to ensure that the quantization
region is contained in such a small region. Since ξ0 = 0, by
choosing sufﬁciently small E0, we have kξkk∞ + Ek ≤ δ
for all k ∈ Z+. Therefore,
the positive-deﬁnite function
Wθk (ξk, Ek) converges to zero as k → ∞, which implies
asymptotic stability. Since the state lies in the quantization
region at every sampling time under Assumption 5, we can
conclude the asymptotic stability of the origin.

The stability condition (19) depends on the DoS parameters
ρF and ρD, which are characterized in Assumptions 3 and
4. The constants ρF and ρD give an upper bounds on the
time-average of the number and the duration of DoS attacks,
respectively. Thus, the condition (19) requires that the average
amount of DoS attacks is small enough. In the absence of DoS
attacks, the stability condition just requires that ν0 < 1, which
is clearly satisﬁed from (16). Notice that κF and κD, which
denote the initial energy for launching attacks, do not appear in
the condition (19). However, these parameters are associated
with the bound of the state trajectories and will be utilized in
the analysis of the region of attraction in the next subsection.
Remark 5: Here, we explain the comparison with the
existing results on networked control under DoS attacks. The
authors of [7] investigate input-to-state stability for linear
plants with respect to disturbances under more restrictive class
of DoS attacks. The remainder term of linearization as well
as measurement errors due to quantization can be seen as
a special case of disturbances. However, the nonlinear term
has the property that its effects vanish at the origin. Also,
quantization errors converge to zero as we employ a dynamic
quantizer. By these properties, we can use Assumptions 3 and
4 in DoS models instead of more restrictive class (see also
Remark 2). The stability condition (19) is similar to that of [7]
(see also [9] for the nonlinear systems case). As our focus is
on a linearization approach, we can recover the global stability
result for linear systems by ignoring the nonlinear parts in (3).
Compared with [9], we explored local stability of the nonlinear
system (1) particularly in the linearization framework. As we
discuss in the next subsection, the local stability point of view
is important when DoS attacks are addressed in stabilization
problems.

Remark 6: The dynamic quantizer proposed in this paper
is resilient in the sense that it does not saturate even under
DoS attacks. The above theorem can also be seen as an
extension of the work [14], where the effects of packet losses
are not considered. Furthermore, we take into account the
unstable dynamics induced by DoS attacks. The condition in
the above theorem indicates the allowable average frequency
and duration of such attacks to preserve local stability of
the nonlinear system. Notice that
if the data rate is ap-
propriately large, then we have µ0 = λmax(P1)/λmin(P0),
µ1 = λmax(P0)/λmin(P1), ν0 = ϕ0, and ν1 = µ1 in
(14)–(17). These parameters are consistent with those of the

stability condition in the case of the inﬁnite data rate which
is presented in [20]. As mentioned in Remark 1, it is difﬁcult
to ﬁnd an appropriate coordinate transformation applied in the
quantization process as in the linear systems case. In particular,
the choice of the coordinate transformation affects the estimate
of the reachable set, which is associated with the zooming-
in/out procedure. Thus, investigating more explicit relationship
between the limitation of quantized control and the tolerance
of DoS attacks for nonlinear systems is left to future work.

C. Convergence Condition on Initial States

In the previous part of this section, we derived a local
stability condition. Due to linearization, we need to keep the
state within a small region around the equilibrium even in the
presence of packet losses. Otherwise, the state cannot converge
to the equilibrium point. In particular, we need to set the initial
condition so that the inequality (18) is satisﬁed. This is because
that inequality may not be valid when kξkk∞ + Ek > δ. The
following theorem provides a condition on E0 that guarantees
the state trajectory to stay inside the stability region at all
times and eventually converge to the origin.

Thoerem 2: Consider the nonlinear networked control sys-
tem (1) with the control input (2). Suppose that Assump-
tions 1–5 hold. Let ω0, ω1, and δ be taken from Lemma 3.
Also, suppose that (19) holds. If we choose E0 to satisfy

Proof: Recall from (20) that, by Lemma 3, if kξkk∞ +

Ek < δ, then

Wθk (ξk, Ek) ≤ cW ωkWθ0 (ξ0, E0).

Under the condition (19), it holds that ω < 1, and hence, we
obtain

kξkk∞ + Ek ≤

where we have used the inequalities (12). Since ξ0 = 0, the

Note that (21) can be written as

Thus, it follows kξkk∞ + Ek < δ for all k ∈ Z+. When the
state lies within the quantization region at time tk, we have
kxkk∞ ≤ kξkk∞ + Ek. Since Wθk (ξk, Ek) converges to zero,
we can guarantee that the state x(t) approaches the origin.

r

Remark 7: The result in Theorem 2 is important in the
sense that the condition (21) may not hold while the stability
condition (19) holds. Such a case occurs when the DoS
parameters κF and κD are large. This property is not discussed

7

in [9] since the authors consider global stability. In practice,
it is important to focus on the effects of DoS attacks to the
region of attraction. The above theorem provides a quantitative
condition under which the state trajectory can remain within
the nominal region of attraction arising due to linearization.
Here, we emphasize that a certain level of DoS attacks makes
the state go outside the region of attraction, possibly leading
to an unstable behavior. Therefore, from the viewpoint of
local stability, the initial state should be close enough to the
equilibrium point if DoS attacks are present.

V. SIMULATION EXAMPLE

Here, we demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our main results

through a simulation example.
Consider the Li´enard system

¨z(t) − (1 − 3az2(t) − 5bz4(t)) ˙z(t) + z(t) = u(t),

where a = 1/3 and b = 1/50. Choosing the state as

x(t) =

.

(cid:21)

The right-hand side of the above equation is locally Lipschitz
with L = 10, satisfying Assumption 1. Also, we choose the
sampling period as T = 0.1 and the number of quantization
levels as M = 6. The uncontrolled system has an unstable
equilibrium point at the origin and exhibits a stable limit cycle.
To stabilize the origin, we consider our linearization-based
quantized control framework. Speciﬁcally, we set the feedback
gain to K = [−1.81 −1.90], which is obtained by using the
LQR method on the linearized system. The simulation result
is presented in Fig. 2, where the initial state is set to x0 =
[0.1 0.1]T. In the ﬁgure, the shaded parts represent the DoS
attack intervals. The bottom ﬁgure shows the changes in the
radius Ek of the quantizer. One can observe that saturation
is avoided by expanding the quantization region when DoS is
present. From the simulation result, we can see that the state
x(t) converges to the origin under DoS attacks.

Then, we explain the importance to consider nonlinear
systems in the context of DoS attacks. Due to linearization, if
the initial state is located far from the equilibrium, then the
state trajectory from that position leaves the region of attrac-
tion and converges to a limit cycle trajectory. In such cases,
the state is unable to go to the origin by the linearization-
based control even after the communication recovers. This
fact can be observed in Fig. 3, where the initial state is set to
x0 = [0.3 0.3]T and DoS attacks are kept the same as above.
Here, the shaded area in gray represents the nominal region of
attraction. This area is numerically obtained by ﬁnding states
such that trajectories starting from there without the effects of
quantization and DoS attacks converge to the origin. Note that
the Lipschitz continuity of f with Lipschitz constant L = 10 is
preserved in this region, that is, the region D in Assumption 1
is larger than the region of attraction. Also, notice that in the

is easy for the attacker to make the state leave the region of
attraction.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have considered a quantized stabilization
problem of nonlinear networked control systems under DoS
attacks. Our proposed control strategy is based on the lin-
earization framework used together with a resilient dynamic
quantizer which does not saturate in the presence of packet
losses. A sufﬁcient condition for stability and an estimate
of the region of attraction have been derived, characterizing
tolerable frequency and duration of DoS attacks. The sim-
ulation example demonstrates our results. Future research in-
cludes synchronization of nonlinear multi-agent systems under
DoS attacks, where information is exchanged among spatially
distributed agents. Furthermore, resilient control against DoS
attacks by using prediction of lost measurements is another
interesting direction.

simulation in Fig. 3, the initial state is within this region. Thus,
the undesired unstable phenomenon is due to the nonlinearity
of the plant induced by the DoS attacks.

Here, we provide some discussion on the theoretical results
in the previous section. The stability condition derived in
Theorem 1 is presented in Fig. 4. Under the DoS parameters at
the lower left area, the stability of the origin is preserved. Thus,
if the initial state is very close to the origin, the trajectory can
converge to the origin even in the presence of DoS attacks.
However, we need to emphasize that the region of attraction
is affected by the strength of DoS attacks. In Theorem 2, the
theoretical value of δ is δ = 1.94 × 10−7. In the presence of
DoS attacks, the estimated region of attraction becomes much
smaller. This theoretical result is indeed quite conservative,
and some numerical methods can be used to gain more precise
estimate of the region of attraction as above. Theoretical study
on the relation between the region of attraction and DoS
attacks is an important direction of future work. For example,
there are vulnerable positions in the state space from which it
