Abstract—Cybersecurity dynamics is a mathematical approach
to modeling and analyzing cyber attack-defense interactions
in networks. In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art in
characterizing one kind of cybersecurity dynamics, known as
preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics, which is a family
of highly nonlinear system models. We prove that this dynamics
in its general form with time-dependent parameters is globally
attractive when the time-dependent parameters are ergodic, and
is (almost) periodic when the time-dependent parameters have
the stronger properties of being (almost) periodic. Our results
supersede the state-of-the-art ones, including that the same type
of dynamics but with time-independent parameters is globally
convergent.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cyberspace is a complex system that has become a critical
infrastructure. However, our understanding of its security is
still superﬁcial, explaining why there are so many cyber at-
tacks on a daily basis. This calls for research in understanding
cybersecurity at many levels of abstractions, ranging from
macroscopic to microscopic [1, 2, 3]. At a macroscopic level,
Kephart and White [4, 5] adapt the classic biological epidemic
models [6] to cyberspace, while inheriting the homogeneity
assumption that each node in a network has equal chance
in attacking any other node. This approach is later extended
to accommodate heterogeneous network structures represented
by arbitrary adjacency matrices [7].

These studies [4, 5, 7] have inspired a systematic approach,
dubbed Cybersecurity Dynamics [1, 2, 3], which can be char-
acterized as follows. First, it proposes using arbitrary matrices
to describe the attack-defense structures that are induced by
cybersecurity (e.g., access control) policies enforced on top
of physical networks. That is, adjacency matrices are used to
model which nodes are allowed to communicate with which
other nodes through some routing paths (with each typically
consisting of multiple point-to-point physical communication
links), rather than modeling the physical links.

Second, computer epidemic models, including [4, 5, 7, 8]
and their numerous follow-up studies, often focus on investi-
gating epidemic threshold, which distinguishes the parameter

regime in which the spreading dies out from the parameter
regime in which the spreading doesn’t. While important,
this understanding is far from sufﬁcient in cybersecurity. For
example, we need to know whether the spreading will be
converging or not when it does not die out.

Third, the rich semantics of cyber attack-defense interac-
tions has led to families of cybersecurity dynamics models,
including: preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13], active cyber defense dynamics [14, 15, 16],
adaptive cyber defense dynamics [17, 18], and proactive cyber
defense dynamics [19]. These theoretical studies have deep-
ened our understanding of cybersecurity. For example, now
we know: preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics is
globally convergent in certain settings [12, 13], and global
convergence is a nice cybersecurity property that makes it
possible to predict and manage cybersecurity [11]; in contrast,
active cyber defense dynamics can be Chaotic [16].

In this paper, we focus on the aforementioned preventive
and reactive cyber defense dynamics, which is a family of
highly nonlinear system models that are initiated in [9] and
inspired by [7]. This dynamics aims to model the interactions
between two classes of cyber attacks and two classes of cyber
defenses. The two classes of attacks are: push-based attacks
(including computer malware spreading) and pull-based at-
tacks (including “drive-by download” attacks; i.e., a computer
gets compromised when visiting a malicious website [20]).
The two classes of defenses are: preventive defenses, which
include the use of access control and intrusion prevention
mechanisms to attempt to prevent attacks from succeeding;
and reactive defenses, which include the use of anti-malware
and intrusion detection mechanisms to attempt to detect and
clean up compromised computers. Since this dynamics uses a
certain product term, which will be elaborated later, to model
the collective effect on a node when attacked by others, it is
also known as the (cid:81)-model.

Closely related to the (cid:81)-model is the the N -intertwined
model [21], or the (cid:80)-model because it uses a certain additive
term (which will be elaborated later as well) to model the
collective effect on a node when attacked by others. This
model is also inspired by [7] and has been studied in, for
example, [22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

A more general preventive and reactive cyber defense dy-
namics is introduced in [13], which accommodates the afore-
mentioned (cid:81)-model and (cid:80)-model as two special cases and is
thus dubbed the uniﬁed dynamics or uniﬁed model. A remark-
able result is that the uniﬁed model is globally convergent in

 
 
 
 
 
 
the entire parameter universe [13]. As shown in [13], this result
supersedes many results presented in the literature, which often
deal with some special cases of the uniﬁed model. While
fairly general, this uniﬁed model [13] only accommodates
time-independent parameters (i.e., parameter values do not
change over time). This time-independence of parameters is
restrictive, and should be eliminated to accommodate time-
dependent parameters to make the theoretical results more
widely applicable. This motivates the present study.

A. Our Contributions

We investigate preventive and reactive cyber defense dy-
namics with time-dependent parameters, or the uniﬁed model
with time-dependent parameters. Our results supersede the
ones obtained in the uniﬁed model with time-independent
parameters [13]; our results also supersede previous results that
are obtained in special cases of the time-dependent (cid:81)-model
[18, 27, 28, 29] and the time-dependent (cid:80)-model [30, 31]. All
of these results typically deal with convergence to an equilib-
rium, meaning that their techniques are no longer applicable in
our setting, explaining why we adopt the skew-product semi-
ﬂow approach and the multiplicative ergodic theorem in the
present paper. We prove that the uniﬁed model with ergodic
parameters is globally attractive (i.e., converging to a unique
trajectory regardless of the initial value as illustrated in Figure
1(a) where the y-axis represents a metric of interest (e.g., the
fraction of compromised nodes in a network [32]), whereas
Figure 1(b) illustrates the absence of global attractivity. We
further prove that when the parameters are almost periodic (vs.
periodic), the uniﬁed model with time-dependent parameters is
also almost periodic (correspondingly, periodic). In addition,
we present bounds on the globally attractive trajectory, which
are useful because (for example) the upper bound can be seen
as the worst case scenario for decision-making purposes when
only partial information about the parameters is given.

(a) Global attractivity

(b) Non-global attractivity

tivity, where the latter is sensitive to the initial value and may
be even Chaotic and therefore unpredictable.

In order to systematize knowledge, we use Figure 2 to
highlight how the present paper supersedes the literature re-
sults. Our Theorem 4 supersedes the global convergence of the
uniﬁed model with time-independent parameters presented in
[13], which in turn supersedes numerous prior results reported
in the literature; this is because the ergodicity condition (or
assumption) required by Theorem 4 naturally holds in the
time-independent setting. When there are no pull-based attacks
(i.e., considering push-based attacks only), our Theorem 3
shows that under even weaker condition (than ergodicity)

on the (cid:81)-dynamics and (cid:80)-dynamics with time-dependent
parameters, because the condition required by our Theorem
3 naturally holds in the (cid:81)-model and (cid:80)-model with time-
dependent parameters investigated in the literature.

the state-of-the-art

To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior study that
aims to characterize the uniﬁed model with time-dependent
parameters in the entire parameter universe. Prior studies
related to preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics can
be divided into two categories: considering time-independent
parameters vs. considering time-dependent parameters. For
time-independent models,
is the global
convergence result of the uniﬁed model [13], which super-
sedes numerous results in the (cid:81)-model (e.g., [11, 12, 13])
and the (cid:80)-model (e.g., [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]). Time-
dependent parameters have been investigated in the (cid:81)-model
and (cid:80)-model, but only to the extent of understanding when
the dynamics converges to the special equilibrium 0 while
assuming there are no pull-based attacks. Speciﬁcally, [18]
investigates the (cid:81)-model with time-dependent parameters and
identiﬁes a sufﬁcient condition under which the dynamics
converges to 0; [27, 28, 29] investigate the convergence to 0 of
the (cid:81)-model with time-independent parameters. For the (cid:80)-
model with time-dependent parameters while assuming there
are no pull-based attacks, sufﬁcient conditions under which
the dynamics converges to 0 are presented in [30, 31, 33, 34].

A. Ergodicity and Almost Periodicity

We propose modeling time-dependent parameters {y(t)}t≥0
as a sequence drawn from an ergodic stochastic process
because we can only observe a single sequence of a stochastic
process in the real world. Therefore, it is necessary to require
that the observed sequence is representative of the stochastic

(accommodating the
(cid:81)-model and the (cid:80)-
model as special cases) is

Our results: The uniﬁed model with time-dependent parameters is globally
attractive when the parameters are ergodic (Theorem 4), and globally converges
to 0 under a certain condition when there are no pull-based attacks (Theorem 3).

R to Rm, (Y, F, P) be a probability space, and θ : R+ × Y →
Y be the right-shift translation that θ(s, y(t)) = y(t + s),
∀s, t ≥ 0. Measure P is called θ-invariant if for any K ∈ F,

Many stochastic processes are ergodic, such as a sequence
of independent and identically distributed random variables
and ergodic Markov processes [37]. Moreover, (almost) peri-
odic functions are also ergodic [35]. Formally, we have:

Deﬁnition 2 (almost periodicity [38]). A continuous function
y(t) : R → Rm is said almost periodic in t if for any (cid:15) > 0,
there exists a number l((cid:15)) > 0 such that every interval of
length l((cid:15)) contains a point ξ ∈ R and

(cid:107)y(t + ξ) − y(t)(cid:107) < (cid:15), ∀t ∈ R,

where ξ is called “an (cid:15)-translation number of y(t)”. A
continuous function f (t, x) : R × X → Rn is called almost
periodic in t if for any x ∈ X, f (t, x) is almost periodic in t.

An almost periodic time-dependent parameter g(t), if not
periodic, has no period, meaning g(t + τ ) = g(t), ∀t ∈ R
does not hold for any τ ∈ R, but g(t + τ ) ≈ g(t), ∀t ∈ R
holds with any degree of approximation for inﬁnitely many
τ ∈ R, where τ may be very large. For example, g(t) =
0.2 × sin(πt) + 0.1 × sin(2
2πt) + 0.3, which contains three
periodic terms, is almost periodic but not periodic.

B. Subhomogeneous and Cooperative Dynamical Systems

We will take advantage of cooperative and subhomogeneous
dynamical systems, where the former means that all of the
off-diagonal
terms of the Jacobian matrix of a dynamical
system are non-negative and the latter (or sublinearity) is a
generalization of concavity.

Deﬁnition 3 (cooperative dynamical system [39]). Consider
(cid:1),
a region X ⊆ Rn
x = [x1, · · · , xn](cid:62) ∈ X, y ∈ Y , and f (x, y) =
[f1(x, y), · · · , fn(x, y)](cid:62) : X × Y → X. A nonautonomous

is said to be cooperative if ∂fv(x, y)/∂xu ≥ 0 holds for ∀u (cid:54)=
v and ∀(x, y) ∈ X × Y .

4

Deﬁnition 4 (subhomogeneity and monotonicity [40]). A
continuous map f (x, y) : X × Y → X is said to be

0. Let H : R×X ×Y → X ×Y be the skew-product semi-ﬂow
associated to system (2) in the form

• subhomogeneous if f (ηx, y) ≥ ηf (x, y) holds for any

x ∈ X, y ∈ Y , and η ∈ (0, 1).

• strictly subhomogeneous if f (ηx, y) > ηf (x, y) holds for

any x ∈ X with x (cid:29) 0, any y ∈ Y and η ∈ (0, 1).

• strongly subhomogeneous if f (ηx, y) (cid:29) ηf (x, y) holds
for any x ∈ X with x (cid:29) 0, any y ∈ Y and η ∈ (0, 1).
• monotone if f (x1, y) ≥ f (x0, y) holds for any x1 ≥ x0

and y ∈ Y .

• strictly monotone if f (x1, y) > f (x0, y) holds for any

x1 > x0 and y ∈ Y .

• strongly monotone if f (x1, y) (cid:29) f (x0, y) holds for any

x1 > x0 and y ∈ Y .

C. Globally Attractive Dynamical Systems

The concept of uniform persistence describes the behav-
ior that trajectories are eventually uniformly away from the
boundary of some closed invariant subset [41, 42]. Intuitively,
when the origin 0 is on the boundary, uniform persistence
implies the instability of the origin 0.

Deﬁnition 5 (persistence and uniform persistence [42]). Con-
sider a closed region X ⊂ Rn
≥0 with 0 ∈ X and a function
space Y ⊂ M(R, Rm). For given x0 ∈ X\{0} and y0 ∈ Y ,
a continuous map ψ(t, x0, y0) : R → X is said to be
• persistent if lim inf t→+∞ ψ(t, x0, y0) (cid:29) 0 holds.
if
• uniformly persistent

lim inf t→+∞ ψ(t, x0, y) (cid:29) 0

holds for ∀x0 ∈ X\{0} and ∀y ∈ Y .

Denote by ψ(t, x0, y) the solution to system (2) with respect
to initial value x(0) = x0 and y ∈ Y (representing time-
dependent parameters in the context of the present paper). Now
we introduce the the deﬁnition of global attractivity.

Deﬁnition 6 (Global attractivity). Consider system (2) with
compact spaces X ⊆ Rn
≥0 and Y ⊆ M(R, Rn), where
(Y, F, P) is a probability space and y = {y(t)}t≥0 ∈ Y is a
sample (or realization) of some time-dependent parameters.

(i) For system (2), equilibrium 0 is said to be almost surely
globally attractive if limt→∞ ψ(t, x0, y) = 0 holds for
any x0 ∈ X and almost every y ∈ Y .

(ii) For system (2) with a given y ∈ Y , a trajec-
y, y) is said to be globally attractive if
y, y)(cid:107) = 0 holds for any

tory ψ(t, x∗
limt→∞ (cid:107)ψ(t, x0, y) − ψ(t, x∗
x0 ∈ X\{0}.

(iii) System (2) is said to be almost surely globally attractive if
for almost every y ∈ Y , there exists a globally attractive
trajectory ψ(t, x∗
y, y), namely that limt→∞ (cid:107)ψ(t, x0, y)−
ψ(t, x∗

y, y)(cid:107) = 0 holds for any x0 ∈ X\{0}.

Theorem 1 below bridges the preceding two concepts.

H(t, x, y) = (ψ(t, x, y), θ(t, y)),

where θ : R × Y → Y is the right-shift translation (see
Deﬁnition 1). Denote by int(X) = X ∩ Rn
(I) for any η ∈ (0, 1), x1, x2 ∈ int(X), ηx1 ≤ x2 ≤ η−1x1
implies that ηψ(t, x1, y) ≤ ψ(t, x2, y) ≤ η−1ψ(t, x1, y),
∀t ∈ R, ∀y ∈ Y ; and

(cid:29)0. Suppose

(II) there exists t0 > 0 and y0 ∈ Y such that for any η ∈
(0, 1), x1, x2 ∈ int(X), ηx1 ≤ x2 ≤ η−1x1 implies that
ηψ(t0, x1, y0) (cid:28) ψ(t0, x2, y0) (cid:28) η−1ψ(t0, x1, y0).
If H has a compact ω-limit set K0 ⊂ int(X) × Y , then the
natural projection p : X × Y → Y is a ﬂow isomorphism
restricted on H(t, ·, ·) : K0 × Y → K0 and for every compact
ω-limit set w(x, y) ⊂ int(X) × Y , we have w(x, y) = K0
and limt→∞ (cid:107)ψ(t, x, y) − ψ(t, x∗, y)(cid:107) = 0, where (x∗, y) =
K0 ∩ p−1(y).

D. Time-Dependent Linear Cooperative Systems

We will

leverage time-dependent

linear systems and δ-

matrices [43]. Consider a time-dependent linear system

dz
dt

= B(t)z(t),

(3)

where z(t) ∈ Rn and B(t) = [bij(t)]n
i,j=1 with bij(t) ≥ 0 for
i (cid:54)= j and t ∈ R. We will relate B(t) to a time-dependent
(attack-defense) graph G(B(t)) = (V, E(t), B(t)) with node
set V = {1, · · · , n}, time-dependent arc set E(t) and time-
dependent weight matrix B(t). A matrix Bδ(t) = [bδ
ij(t)] with

bδ
ij(t) =




bii(t)

bij(t) ≥ δ & i (cid:54)= j
bij(t) < δ & i (cid:54)= j
i = j

is called a δ-matrix of B(t) and its associated graph G(Bδ(t))
is called δ-graph of B(t).

When {B(t)}t≥0 is ergodic, meaning system (3) is ergodic,
let M (B) denote its mean value (cf. Deﬁnition 1). We will use
the following lemma, which is a basic result regarding ergodic
time-dependent linear system (3). This lemma says that the
fundamental solution matrix of system (3) is positive when
{B(t)}t∈R is ergodic and the associated graph G(M (B)) is
strongly connected; its proof is deferred to Appendix A.

Lemma 1. Consider system (3) with bounded and ergodic
{B(t)}t≥0. Let M (B) denote the mean value of {B(t)}t≥0
and U (t, s) the fundamental solution matrix of system (3).
Then, we have:

(i) every element of U (t, s) is nonnegative for any t ≥ s ≥ 0;

and

Theorem 1 (Theorem 2.3.5 in [40]). Let X ⊆ Rn
≥0 and Y
be compact spaces, where Y has no nonempty, proper, closed
invariant subset with respect to θ and there is a metric d such
that for any distinct y1, y2 ∈ Y , inf t∈R d(θ(t, y1), θ(t, y2)) >

(ii) if G(M (B)) is strongly connected, there exists T > 0
such that for each ∆ ≥ T , one can ﬁnd (cid:15) > 0 (dependent
on ∆) such that every element of U (s + ∆, s) is greater
than (cid:15) for any s ≥ 0.

The preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics
model introduced in [13], dubbed uniﬁed model with time-
independent parameters, uniﬁes two families of models into a
single framework. The uniﬁed dynamics or model is proven
to be globally convergent (i.e., always converging to some
equilibrium) [13]. Now we present and analyze its extension
to uniﬁed model with time-dependent parameters.

A. The Uniﬁed Model with Time-Dependent Parameters

The uniﬁed model with time-dependent parameters still de-
scribes the dynamics of the global cybersecurity state incurred
by the interactions between two classes of cyber attacks (i.e.,
pull-based attacks and push-based attacks) and two classes
of defenses (i.e., preventive defenses and reactive defenses)
in a network. Intuitively, the attack-defense structure incurred
by the attack-defense interactions at time t can be described
by a directed graph, denoted by ˜G(t) = ( ˜V (t), ˜E(t)), where
˜V (t) is the node (representing a computer) set and ˜E(t) is the
arc set, and (u, v) ∈ ˜E(t) means node u can communicate
with, and therefore can wage push-based attacks against,
node v at
it sufﬁces to
consider a time-independent node set V = {1, . . . , n}, namely
G(t) = (V, E(t)) rather than ˜G(t) = ( ˜V (t), ˜E(t)), because
the evolution of ˜V (t) can be “encoded” into the evolution of
E(t), leading to a simpler representation G(t) = (V, E(t)) of
attack-defense structures.

time t. As we will

justify later,

The effect of attacks against preventive defenses is mod-
eled as follows. Push-based attacks take place on attack-
defense structures G(t) = (V, E(t)). Denote by A(t) the
adjacency matrix of G(t), where avu(t) = 1 if (u, v) ∈ E(t)
and avu(t) = 0 otherwise. Let γvu(t) ∈ [0, 1] denote the
probability that a push-based attack, which is waged by a
compromised node u ∈ V against a secure v ∈ V over arc
(u, v) ∈ E(t) at time t, succeeds (i.e., causing v to become
compromised); that is, 1 − γvu(t) represents the effectiveness
of the preventive defense mechanism deployed at node v
and/or the arc (u, v). Let Γ(t) = [γvu(t)]n×n denote the
probability matrix corresponding to the adjacency matrix A(t).
The effect of push-based attacks over G(t) can be described
by (G(t), Γ(t)). On the other hand, pull-based attacks can be
described by using αv(t) ∈ [0, 1] to denote the probability
that a secure node v ∈ V becomes compromised at time t
because of pull-based attacks; that is, 1 − αv(t) represents the
effectiveness of preventive defense against pull-based attacks.
For modeling the effect of reactive defenses against suc-
cessful attacks, let βv(t) ∈ [0, 1] denote the probability that
a compromised node v is detected and “cleaned up” (i.e.,
becoming secure) at time t; that is, 1 − βv(t) represents the
ineffectiveness of the reactive defense.

At any time t, a node v ∈ V is in one of two cybersecurity
states, compromised or secure. Let iv(t) and sv(t) respectively
denote the probability that v is in the compromised state
and the secure state at time t. Let i(t) = [i1(t), · · · , in(t)]
and s(t) = [s1(t), · · · , sn(t)]. Figure 3 describes the state
transition diagram of a node v ∈ V , where hv (i(t), βv(t)) :
[0, 1]n×[0, 1] → [0, 1] is a function that outputs the probability

that a compromised node v becomes secure at time t because
of the deployed reactive defenses, and gv (i(t), αv(t), Γ(t)) :
[0, 1]n × [0, 1] × [0, 1]n,n → [0, 1] is a function that outputs
the probability that a secure node v becomes compromised at
time t because of the push-based and pull-based attacks that
penetrate the deployed preventive defenses. Figure 3 and the
fact that iv(t) + sv(t) = 1 holds for any v ∈ V and any t ≥ 0,
the uniﬁed model with time-dependent parameters is described
by the following dynamical system for each v ∈ V :

div(t)
dt

= − hv (i(t), βv(t)) · iv(t)

+ gv (i(t), αv(t), Γ(t)) · (1 − iv(t)) .

(4)

The research objective is to analyze system or model
(4) with time-dependent parameters αv(t), βv(t), γvu(t) and
G(t) = (V, E(t)). This is a challenging task because among
the term gv (i(t), αv(t), Γ(t)) is highly non-
other things,
linear. In order to simplify presentation, we use y(t) to
denote the collection of parameters at time t, namely y(t) =
[α(t), β(t), vec(A(t))(cid:62), vec(Γ(t))(cid:62)], where vec(matrix) is
the vector representation of a matrix matrix obtained by
concatenating the columns; we use fv(i(t), y(t)) to denote the
right-hand side of system (4), namely

fv(i(t), y(t)) = −hv (i(t), βv(t)) · iv(t)

+ gv (i(t), αv(t), Γ(t)) · (1 − iv(t)) ;

(5)

and we let f (i, y) = [f1(i, y), · · · , fn(i, y)](cid:62).

On the generality of model (4) in accommodating models
studied in the literature. Model (4) is a general framework
because hv and gv can be instantiated in many ways. In
particular, model (4) degenerates to the uniﬁed model with
time-independent parameters [13] by letting G(t), γvu(t),
αv(t) and βv(t) be time-independent. Moreover, the extended
model also accommodates the aforementioned two models
as special cases, namely the (cid:81)-model because a (cid:81)-term
instantiates gv as shown in Eq. (6) and the (cid:80)-model because
a (cid:80)-term instantiates gv as shown in Eq. (6).

How can G(t) = (V, E(t)) encode ˜G(t) = ( ˜V (t), ˜E(t))?
Given ˜G(t) = ( ˜V (t), ˜E(t)) over time t, we can set V =
(cid:83)
˜V (t), meaning that a node u ∈ V − ˜V (t) can be treated
as an isolated, dummy node in G(t) = (V, E(t)) such that
(u, ·) /∈ E(t) and (·, u) /∈ E(t) and αu(t) = 0. This justiﬁes
why it sufﬁces to consider G(t) = (V, E(t)).

B. Some Properties of Functions hv, gv and Parameters y(t)
In order to make the model as widely applicable as possible,
we need to make as few restrictions as possible on functions
hv and gv in model (4). In order to facilitate analysis, we
need functions hv and gv to have the following Properties
1-4, which are both intuitive and natural.

Property 1. For ∀v, hv (i, βv(t)) and gv (i, αv(t), Γ(t)) have
continuous ﬁrst and second derivatives with respect to i.

The validation of these four properties, while intuitive, is an
orthogonal research problem to the present characterization
study and will be investigated in the future.

C. Model (4) Is Strongly Subhomogeneous

We start by showing that model (4) is strongly subhomoge-

neous under Properties 1 and 3.

Theorem 2. Model (4) under Properties 1 and 3 is strongly
subhomogeneous in [0, 1]n.

The proof of Theorem 2 is similar to the proof of Lemma
4 in [13], which considers the uniﬁed model with time-
independent parameters. This is because the proof does not
need to make any restrictions on the time-dependence of the
parameters, meaning that the proof is equally applicable to
both time-independent parameters (the setting of [13]) and our
setting of time-dependent parameters.

Property 1 is the baseline for analytical treatment.

D. Special equilibrium 0 Is Globally Stable

Property 2. Consider ∀v and ∀u (cid:54)= v, (i) gv(0, αv(t), Γ(t)) =
αv(t), ∂gv(i(t), αv(t), Γ(t))/∂iu = 0 when γvu(t) = 0,
for any δ > 0,
and ∂hv(i(t), βv(t))/∂iu = 0;
∂gv(i(t), αv(t), Γ(t))/∂iu > δ1 holds for some δ1 > 0 when
γvu(t) > δ.

(ii)

Part (i) of Property 2 abstracts the intuition that the prob-
ability node v gets compromised at time t is independent of
the state of u when u cannot attack node v or (u, v) /∈ E(t),
and the probability node u becomes secure at
time t is
independent of the states of the other nodes at time t. Part
(ii) of Property 2 abstracts the intuition that the probability v
becomes compromised at time t increases with the probability
u is compromised when u can attack v or (u, v) ∈ E(t).

Property 3. Consider ∀v, gv(i, αv(t), Γ(t))
subho-
to i and Di(gv(i, βv(t)) +

is

Property 3 abstracts the intuition that there is always a
nonzero probability for a compromised node v to become
secure because reactive defenses have a nonzero probability
to succeed or βv(t) ≥ 0.

In order to prove the global attractivity of model (4) with
time-dependent parameters, we need parameters y(t) to satisfy
the following property:

Property 4 (ergodicity of {y(t)}t≥0). {y(t)}t≥0 is ergodic,
where y(t) = [α(t), β(t), vec(A(t))(cid:62), vec(Γ(t))(cid:62)].

Note that Properties 1-3 are naturally satisﬁed by the (cid:81)-
model and the (cid:80)-model with time-dependent parameters,
namely systems or models (6). This is because Properties 1-
3 naturally extend their time-independent counterparts, which
are satisﬁed by the (cid:81)-model and the (cid:80)-model with time-
independent parameters. We will show that Property 4 (i.e.,
ergodicity) is close to, if not, the necessary condition for the
global attractivity of model (4), by presenting a numerical ex-
ample to show that its violation disrupts the global attractivity.

Theorem 3 below shows that when there are no pull-based
attacks, namely αv(t) = 0, ∀v ∈ V , ∀t, the special equilibrium
0 of model (4) is globally stable under a certain condition.
Note that 0 is no equilibrium when some nodes are subject to
pull-based attacks, namely that the average of αv(t) over t is
positive for some v ∈ V . Proof of Theorem 3 is deferred to
Appendix B.

Theorem 3 (equilibrium 0 is globally stable under Properties
1-3). Consider model (4) and αv(t) = 0, ∀v ∈ V , ∀t. For any
y ∈ Y with µ(Dif (0, y)) < 0, equilibrium 0 is globally stable
in [0, 1]n, namely that every trajectory ψ(t, i0, y) of model (4)
converges to 0 regardless of the initial value i(0) ∈ [0, 1]n.

E. Model (4) Is Globally Attractive

Theorem 4 (main result: the uniﬁed model with time-depen-
dent parameters is globally attractive under Properties 1-4).
Model (4) is almost surely globally attractive in [0, 1]n\{0},
meaning that for almost every y ∈ Y , there exists a unique
y, y) ∈ [0, 1]n such that limt→∞ (cid:107)ψ(t, i0, y) −
trajectory ψ(t, i∗
y, y)(cid:107) = 0 holds for any i0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0}. Moreover,
ψ(t, i∗
∀v ∈ V , [ψ(t, i∗
y, y)]v (cid:54)= 0 as long as node v is subject to
pull-based attacks, meaning that the average of αv(t) over
time is positive.

Note that equilibrium 0 can be seen as a special case of a
trajectory, but we separate its treatment (Theorem 3) from the
treatment of the global attractivity in [0, 1]n\{0} (Theorem 4)
because the former, as a special case, can be proven without
requiring the parameters {y(t)}t≥0 to be ergodic (Property 4).
The proof of Theorem 4 is deferred to Appendix G. In
order to prove Theorem 4, we need the following Lemmas
2–5, whose proofs are respectively deferred to Appendices
C–F. In the following lemmas, we let M (Γ) denote the
mean value of the ergodic process {Γ(t)}t≥0 and call the
weighted graph G(M (Γ)) the mean attack-defense structure
of (G(t), Γ(t)). Lemmas 2–5 cope with different settings of
the parameters (following the “divide and conquer” strategy):

there are pushed-based and pull-based attacks vs. there are
only pushed-based attacks (i.e., no nodes are subject to pull-
based attacks); the mean attack-defense structure is strongly
connected vs. it is not strongly connected. Lemmas 2-3 deal
with the case that there are no pull-based attacks, namely
αv(t) = 0, ∀v ∈ V , ∀t; Lemma 4 deals with the case that
there is at least some node v ∈ V that is subject to pull-
based attack, namely that these is at least one v ∈ V such
that the average of αv(t)’s over time t is positive; Lemma
5 deals with the case that the mean attack-defense structure
G(M (Γ)) has two strongly connected components, where the
mean is averaged over time. Note that it sufﬁces to consider
two strongly connected components because multiple strongly
connected components can be treated in the same fashion and
any attack-defense structure can be partitioned into strongly
connected components.

1) Global attractivity when there are no pull-based attacks:
Theorem 1 says that model (4) is globally attractive when the
dynamics is uniformly persistent (Deﬁnition 5) and satisﬁes
conditions (I) and (II) of Theorem 1. We ﬁrst prove that model
(4) is uniformly persistent when µ(Dif (0, y)) > 0 and the
mean attack-defense structure G(M (Γ)) is strongly connected.

Lemma 2 (model (4) is uniformly persistent when there are no
pull-based attacks, under Properties 1-4). If µ(Dif (0, y)) > 0
and the mean attack-defense structure G(M (Γ)) is strongly
connected, trajectories of model (4) with nonzero initial values
are uniformly persistent, namely lim inf t→+∞ ψ(t, i0, y) (cid:29) 0,
∀i0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0} and ∀y ∈ Y .

Lemma 3 below shows that model (4) is globally attractive
(Deﬁnition 6) when Properties 1-4 hold and the mean attack-
defense structure is strongly connected.

Lemma 3 (model (4) is globally attractive when there are no
pull-based attacks under Properties 1-4). Suppose the mean
attack-defense structure G(M (Γ)) is strongly connected.
(i) If µ(Dif (0, y)) > 0, then there exists, for almost every
y, y) ∈ (0, 1]n that is

y ∈ Y , a positive trajectory ψ(t, i∗
globally attractive in [0, 1]n\{0}.

(ii) If µ(Dif (0, y)) = 0, then there exists, for almost every
y, y) ∈ [0, 1]n that is globally
y ∈ Y , a trajectory ψ(t, i∗
attractive in [0, 1]n\{0}. Moreover,
, y0) ∈
(0, 1]n for some y0 ∈ Y , then for almost every y ∈ Y ,

is zero, namely M (αv) = 0,

2) Global attractivity when there are pull-based attacks:
From the ergodicity and non-negativity of the αv(t)’s,
it
follows that the mean value of {αv(t)}t≥0 over t, denoted
by M (αv),
if and only if
αv(t) = 0 almost surely. Therefore, when αv(t) is ergodic,
node v is subject to pull-based attacks if and only if the
mean value M (αv) > 0. In what follows, we will use
αv(t) > 0 to denote that the mean value M (αv) is positive.
Let Vα>0 = {v : M (αv) > 0} denote the set of nodes that are
subject to pull-based attacks. The global attractivity of model

7

(4) when Vα>0 (cid:54)= ∅ is established by the following lemma,
while noting that 0 is no longer an equilibrium of model (4)
when some nodes are subject to pull-based attacks.

Lemma 4 (model (4) is globally attractive when there are
pull-based attacks under Properties 1-4). If Vα>0 (cid:54)= ∅ and the
mean attack-defense structure G(M (Γ)) is strongly connected,
then there exists, for almost every y ∈ Y , a unique positive tra-
jectory ψ(t, i∗
y, y) that is globally attractive in [0, 1]n, namely
limt→∞ (cid:107)ψ(t, i0, y) − ψ(t, i∗

y, y)(cid:107) = 0 holds ∀i0 ∈ [0, 1]n.

3) Global attractivity when the mean attack-defense struc-
ture is not strongly connected: Lemmas 3-4 show model (4)
is globally attractive when the mean attack-defense structure
G(M (Γ)) is strongly connected. Now we consider the case
that G(M (Γ)) is not strongly connected, but can be divided
into two strongly connected components (SCCs), denoted by
SCC1 and SCC2. When there are no links between SCC1
and SCC2, the global attractivity for each SCCk, k = 1, 2
is obtained from Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 directly by treating
each SCC as an attack-defense structure. Therefore, we only
need to consider the case that there exist links between these
two strongly connected components of G(M (Γ)).

From the Perron-Frobenius theory [44], M (Γ) can be writ-

ten in the lower-triangular block form,

M (Γ) = P

(cid:21)

P (cid:62)

where P is a permutation matrix, ˜Γkk is irreducible and
corresponds to SCCk for k = 1, 2, and ˜Γ21 (cid:54)= 0. It follows
from Property 2 that for any v (cid:54)= u, ∂fv(0, y)/∂iu =
∂gv(0, αv, Γ)/∂iu = 0 holds if γvu(t) = 0, implying that
the Jacobian matrix Dif (0, y) can be written as

Dif (0, y) = P

lemma considers the general case of αv(t) ≥ 0, ∀v ∈ V .

, y) ∈ [0, 1]|SCC1| such that

Lemma 5 (model (4) is globally attractive when the mean

nents, under Properties 1-4). Suppose G(M (Γ)) consists of
two strongly connected components SCC1 and SCC2 such
that (without loss of generality) at least one node in SCC1 has
a path to a node in SCC2. For SCC1, there exists a globally
attractive trajectory φ(t, i∗

Theorem 5 (model (4) is globally attractive and almost
periodic when its parameters are almost periodic). Consider
model (4) under Properties 1-3 and y(t) is almost periodic
(i.e., a property stronger than Property 4): (i) there exists an
almost periodic trajectory ψ(t, i∗, y) ∈ [0, 1]n that is globally
attractive in [0, 1]n\{0}, namely that limt→∞ (cid:107)ψ(t, i0, y) −
ψ(t, i∗, y)(cid:107) = 0 holds for any i0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0}; (ii) for any
(cid:15) > 0, there exists M > 0 so that the (cid:15)-translation numbers
of y(t) are M (cid:15)-translation numbers of the globally attractive
trajectory ψ(t, i∗, y).

Proof of Theorem 5 is deferred to Appendix H. Since
periodic functions are almost periodic by setting (cid:15) = 0 in
Deﬁnition 2, we obtain the following corollary.

Corollary 1 (model (4) is globally attractive and periodic
when its parameters are periodic). Consider model (4) un-
der Properties 1-3. Suppose y(t) is periodic with period
w, then there exists an w-periodic trajectory ψ(t, i∗, y) of
model (4) that is globally attractive in [0, 1]n\{0}, namely
that limt→∞ (cid:107)ψ(t, i0, y) − ψ(t, i∗, y)(cid:107) = 0 holds for any
i0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0}.

G. Bounding the Globally Attractive Positive Trajectory

When given all of the parameters, one can numerically
compute the globally attractive trajectory. In practice, we may
not know the values of all parameters (i.e., the matter of partial
vs. full information). In this case, a useful alternative is to
bound the globally attractive trajectory because, for example,
we can treat the upper bound as the worst case scenario in
cyber defense decision-making. In order to derive such bounds,
we need hv and gv to have the following intuitive property:

Property 5 (properties of hv and gv needed for bounding
the globally attractive trajectory). Consider gv(i, αv, Γ) and
hv(i, βv), it holds that

(i) ∂gv/∂αv ≥ 0 and ∂gv/∂γvu ≥ 0 for ∀u, v ∈ V , which
reﬂects the intuition that the probability node v getting
compromised increases with the pull-based and push-
based attack capabilities; and

(ii) ∂hv/∂βv ≥ 0 for ∀v ∈ V , which reﬂects the intuition
that when everything else is ﬁxed,
the probability a
compromised node v becoming secure increases with the
reactive defense capability.

The basic idea is to leverage imin and imax to derive
the bounds. When imin and imax are unknown, we can set
imin = 0 and imax = 1. On the other hand, the properties
∂gv/∂iu ≥ 0, ∂gv/∂αv ≥ 0 and ∂gv/∂γvu ≥ 0 lead to that
gv is monotone with respect to i, αv and γvu, which implies

gv(imin, αv, Γ) ≤ gv(i(t), αv, Γ) ≤ gv(imax, αv, Γ).

Then, it follows from ∂hv/∂βv ≥ 0 that

The following theorem can bound the dynamics when only
knowing the lower and upper bounds of parameters αv(t),

Proof of Theorem 6 is deferred to Appendix I.

iv(t) be the solution to model (4) and iv(t) and iv(t) be the

H. Relationship between the Literature Results and Ours

Now we show that our results supersede the state-of-the-art

k = 1, · · · , K, and the Jacobian matrix Dif (0, y) has the

where P is a permutation matrix, and Dfkk corresponds to
SCCk for k = 1, · · · , K. Let Rk be the indices of the SCC’s
that have links pointing to SCCk. Then, for each SCCk, we
have:
(i) 0|SCCk| is globally asymptotically stable in [0, 1]n if one

of the following conditions holds:

– VSCCk ∩ Vα>0 = ∅, µ(Dfkk) ≤ 0 and SCCRk = ∅;
– VSCCk ∩ Vα>0 = ∅, µ(Dfkk) ≤ 0, SCCRk (cid:54)= ∅ and
0|SCCr| is globally asymptotically stable for every
r ∈ Rk.

(ii) SCCk has a unique positive equilibrium that is globally
asymptotically stable in [0, 1]|SCCk| if VSCCk ∩Vα>0 (cid:54)= ∅.
(iii) SCCk has a unique positive equilibrium that is globally
asymptotically stable in [0, 1]|SCCk|\{0} if one of the
following conditions holds:

– SCCk ∩ Vα>0 = ∅ and µ(Dfkk) > 0;
– SCCk ∩ Vα>0 = ∅, SCCRk (cid:54)= ∅ and 0SCCr is not
globally asymptotically stable for every r ∈ Rk.
The state-of-the-art result of the (cid:80)-model with time-
dependent G(t) is given in [30, 31], and the state-of-the-
art result of the (cid:81)-model with time-dependent G(t) is given

in [18, 27, 28, 29]. However,
gate the stability of the equilibrium 0. Among these stud-
ies, [27, 28, 29, 30] consider the discrete-time model and
show that the equilibrium 0 is stable if the joint spectral
radius of the set of system matrices is smaller than 1. For
a discrete-time system z(t + 1) = C(t)z(t), t ∈ N,
let
µd(C(t)) = limn→∞ 1/n log((cid:107)C(n) · · · C(1)C(0)(cid:107)) be the
associated maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) and ρ(C(t))
be the joint spectral radius given in [27, 28, 29, 30]. In fact, the
joint spectral radius can be seen as the discrete-time version
of the MLE; i.e., ρ(C(t)) < 1 is equivalent to µd(C(t)) < 0
and thus their result is a special case of our Theorem 3.

Corollary 3 (corollary of our Theorem 3 is equivalent to
Theorem 1 in [27], Theorem 2 in [28], Theorem 1 in [29] and
Theorem 2.1 in [30]). Consider the discrete-time version of
model (4). Suppose αv(t) = 0 and γvu(t) = γ(t), ∀u, v ∈ V ,
∀t. Let B(t) = diag(β1(t), . . . , βn(t)). If ρ((I − B(t)) +
the discrete-time model
the dynamics of
γ(t)A(t)) < 1,
globally converges to equilibrium 0.

The (cid:80)-model with time-dependent parameters is studied in
[31] and shown to converge to the equilibrium 0 when the
time-dependent parameters satisfy some speciﬁc conditions.
For symmetric matrices C(t), t ≥ 0, we have µ(C(t)) ≤
supt≥0 λ1(C(t)), meaning that the following corollary of our
Theorem 3 is equivalent to the result of [31].

Corollary 4 (corollary of our Theorem 3 is equivalent to
Theorem 1 in [31]). Consider model (4) while instantiating its
term gv(i(t), αv(t), Γ(t)) as the (cid:80)-model with time-dependent
parameters. Suppose αv(t) = 0 and Γ(t) being symmetric
for ∀v ∈ V , ∀t. Let B(t) = diag(β1(t), . . . , βn(t)). If
supt≥0 λ1(Γ(t) − B(t)) < 0, the dynamics of (4) globally
converges to equilibrium 0.

The (cid:81)-model with time-dependent parameters is considered
in [18], which shows when the dynamics converges to the

9

equilibrium 0. The following corollary of our Theorems 3 and
4 is equivalent to the result of [18].

Corollary 5 (corollary of our Theorems 3 and 4 is equivalent
to Theorem 1 in [18]). Consider model (4) while instantiat-
ing its term gv(i(t), αv(t), Γ(t)) as the (cid:81)-model with time-
dependent parameters. Suppose αv(t) = 0 and γvu(t) =
γ(t), ∀u, v ∈ V , ∀t. Let B(t) = diag(β1(t), . . . , βn(t)).
If µ(γ(t)A(t) − B(t)) < 0, model (4) in this special case
converges to equilibrium 0; if µ(γ(t)A(t) − B(t)) > 0 and
the linear system dz(t)/dt = (γ(t)A(t)−B(t))z(t) is ergodic,
equilibrium 0 is unstable.

I. Systematizing Knowledge

We use Figure 4 to systematize the relationship between
the properties, lemmas, theorems, and corollaries (i.e., their
equivalent literature results).

Fig. 4: Relationship between the mathematical properties,
lemmas, theorem, and corollaries presented in the paper.

IV. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

We use numerical results to conﬁrm our analytic results. In
our experiments, we use the Euler method for the numerical
simulation of model (4) by setting the iteration step as 0.05.
In order to succinctly present
the experimental result, we
plot the dynamics of (cid:104)i(t)(cid:105) = (cid:80)
v iv(t)/|V |, which is the
fraction of compromised nodes at time t. In our experiment,
we set the initial fraction of compromised nodes as (cid:104)i(0)(cid:105) ∈
{0.25, 0.5, 0.75}, meaning that 25%, 50%, and 75% randomly
chosen nodes are in the compromised state at time t = 0.

A. Conﬁrming Global Attractivity

In our experiments, we use the Gnutella05 peer-to-peer net-
work http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ as the initial attack-defense
structure G(0), where |V | = 8846 nodes and |E(0)| = 31839
arcs. In order to generate G(t) for t > 0, we randomly add or
delete 2% of the arcs of the attack-defense structure after every
10 simulation time units. In our experiments, we consider the
(cid:80)-model with time-dependent parameters hv(i, βv) = βv(t)

1-3 as required by the main results (i.e., Theorem 4).

In the ﬁrst experiment, we set αv(t) = 0, ∀v, ∀t, and use

the following parameter sets

• (p1): βv(t) = 0.1 sin(t) + 0.1 sin(

2t) + 0.5, ∀v ∈ V ,

and γuv(t) = 0.05 sin(πt/5) + 0.1, ∀(u, v) ∈ E(t);

• (p2): βv(t) = 0.1 sin(t) + 0.1 sin(

2t) + 0.4, ∀v ∈ V ,

and γuv(t) = 0.05 sin(πt/5) + 0.1, ∀(u, v) ∈ E(t);

• (p3): βv(t) = 0.1 sin(t) + 0.1 sin(

2t) + 0.1, ∀v ∈ V ,

Note that parameter sets (p1), (p2) and (p3) correspond to
the cases µ(Dif (0, y(t))) < 0, µ(Dif (0, y(t))) = 0 and
µ(Dif (0, y(t))) > 0, respectively.

Figures 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c) plot the dynamics of the fraction
of compromised nodes over time, namely (cid:104)i(t)(cid:105), with param-
eter sets (p1), (p2), (p3) and different initial infection values.
We observe that the the dynamics always converges to a unique
trajectory. It reinforces the result that the dynamics converges
to the equilibrium 0 when µ(Dif (0, y(t))) < 0, attracts to
a positive trajectory when µ(Dif (0, y(t))) > 0, and attracts
to a trajectory (possibly an equilibrium 0 or non-negative
trajectory) when µ(Dif (0, y(t))) = 0. Figure 5(d) plots the
dynamics of (cid:104)i(t)(cid:105) with multiple βv(t)’s, and shows that the
globally attractive trajectory converges to 0 as βv(t) increases.
This reinforces the intuition that a larger βv(t) leads to a
smaller µ(Dif (0, y(t))) and (cid:104)i(t)(cid:105) as well as the convergence
to the equilibrium 0.

In the second experiment, we set αv(t) = 0.1 sin(3t) +
3t) + 0.2 if v ∈ Vα>0, set βv(t) and γvu(t)
0.1 sin(
as in the aforementioned parameter set (p2), and consider
|Vα>0|/|V | ∈ {0.25, 0.5, 0.75}, namely that 25%, 50%, and
75% randomly chosen nodes are subject to pull-based attacks,
respectively. Figure 6(a) plots the dynamics of (cid:104)i(t)(cid:105) with
|Vα>0|/|V | = 0.5 and different initial values, and shows that
the dynamics converges to a unique positive trajectory. Figure

In order to characterize the impact of time-dependent func-
tions and pull-based attacks on the tightness of the bounds,
we consider the following four parameter sets (p5)-(p8):

• (p5): αv(t) = 0.05 sin(3t) + 0.05 sin(

3t) + 0.5, ∀v ∈
Vα>0 where |Vα>0|/|V | = 0.5; βv(t) = 0.05 sin(t) +
0.05 sin(
2t) + 0.5, ∀v ∈ V ; γuv(t) = 0.1 sin(πt/5) +
0.5, ∀(u, v) ∈ E(t);

√

√

• (p6): αv = 0, βv(t) = 0.1 sin(t) + 0.1 sin(

2t) + 0.4,

∀v ∈ V ; γuv(t) = 0.1 sin(πt/5) + 0.5, ∀(u, v) ∈ E(t);
• (p7): {αv(t)}t≥0 ∼ U ([0.1, 0.3]), ∀v ∈ Vα>0 where
|Vα>0|/|V | = 0.5; {βv(t)}t≥0 ∼ U ([0.4, 0.7]), ∀v ∈ V ;
γuv(t) = 0.1, ∀(u, v) ∈ E(t);

• (p8): αv = 0, {βv(t)}t≥0 ∼ U ([0.4, 0.7]), ∀v ∈ V ;

γuv(t) = 0.1, ∀(u, v) ∈ E(t).

Note that

in these settings,

it holds that {η(t)}t≥0 ∼
U ([a, b]) if η(t) satisﬁes (i) η(t) = ηk when t ∈ [k, k +1), k ∈
N and (ii) ηk, k ∈ N follow the uniformly distribution in [a, b]

the ergodic property.

(p5)-(p8) and the corresponding bounds given by Theorem
6. The lower bounds in Figure 7 (b) and (d) are 0 because
imin = 0 and αv(t) = 0 in parameter sets (p6) and (p8). We
observe that the bounds in Figure 7 can be very loose, perhaps
because imax = 1 and imin = 0 in this example, which reﬂects
the lack of information on the globally attractive trajectory.

C. Are the Sufﬁcient Conditions Necessary?

It is known [16] that some cybersecurity dynamics can ex-
hibit bifurcation and chaos. Since we leverage subhomogeneity
(Property 3) and ergodicity (Property 4) to obtain the global
attractivity result for the uniﬁed dynamics with time-dependent
it makes us wonder how far these sufﬁcient
parameters,
conditions are from being necessary. In what follows we use
numerical examples to show that violating these properties can
cause violation of global attractivity, hinting subhomogeneity
and ergodicity may be necessary; the rigorous treatment of
this is a difﬁcult task and left for future research.

For constructing examples, it sufﬁces to consider a special
kind of time-independent attack-defense structures G in Erd¨os-
R´enyi (ER) random graph. Speciﬁcally, we consider an ER
structure with n = 1, 000 nodes and edge probability p =
0.1. The ER graph is then interpreted as a directed graph. We
consider the (cid:80)-model as an example.

First, we empirically show that subhomogeneity (required
by Property 3) may be necessary for global attractivity. Let us
consider the following functions for the (cid:80)-model:

hv(i, βv) = βv(t),

gv(i, αv, Γ) = αv(t) +

(cid:32) (cid:80)

u∈Nv (t) γvu(t)avu(t)iu(t)
max{|Nv(t)|, 1}

(cid:33)2

.

Note that

the preceding gv is not subhomogeneous. We

consider the following two combinations:

√

• (p9): αv = 0, ∀v; βv(t) = 0.05 sin(t) + 0.05 sin(

2t) +
0.1, ∀v ∈ V ; γuv(t) = 0.1 sin(πt/5) + 0.7, ∀(u, v) ∈
E(t);

• (p10): αv(t) = 0.1 sin(3t) + 0.1 sin(

3t) + 0.1, ∀v ∈
Vα>0 where |Vα>0|/|V | = 0.2; the other parameters are
the same as in (p9).

√

Figure 8(a) plots the dynamics of (cid:104)i(t)(cid:105) with parameter set
(p9) but different initial values (cid:104)i(0)(cid:105). We observe that the
dynamics is not globally attractive because different initial
values lead to different
trajectories. Figure 8(b) plots the
dynamics of (cid:104)i(t)(cid:105) with parameter set (p10) but different initial
values (cid:104)i(0)(cid:105). We observe that the dynamics is not globally
initial values lead to different
attractive because different
trajectories. These experiments hint that subhomogeneity may
be necessary for global attractivity.

Second, we empirically show that ergodicity may be neces-
sary for global attractivity. Let us consider the (cid:80)-model (6)
without pull-based attacks, namely

• (p11): αv(t) = 0, ∀v ∈ V ; γuv(t) = 0.3, ∀(u, v) ∈ E(t)

(b) (p10) with |Vα>0|/|V | = 0.2

attractive when gv is not subhomogeneous.

Fig. 9: Example with pa-
rameter set (p11) show-
ing that the (cid:80)-model (6)
is not globally attractive
when {βv(t)}t≥0 is not
ergodic.

Note that {βv(t)}t≥0 is not ergodic in this example. Figure
9 plots the dynamics of (cid:104)i(t)(cid:105) with parameter set (p11) but
different initial values (cid:104)i(0)(cid:105) as well as different realizations
of the non-ergodic {βv(t)}t≥0. We observe that the dynamics
is not globally attractive because different initial values lead to
different trajectories, hinting that ergodicity may be necessary.

V. CONCLUSION

We have proved that preventive and reactive cyber defense
dynamics with ergodic time-dependent parameters is globally
attractive and the dynamics is further (almost) periodic when
the time-dependent parameters are (almost) periodic. These
theoretical results supersede the state-of-the-art understanding
of at least two models extensively investigated in the literature,
and shed a light on the boundary between “when the dynamics
is analytically treatable” and “when the dynamics is not ana-
lytically treatable”. There are important, but challenging, open
problems for future research. First, we numerically showed
that ergodicity may be necessary for global attractivity. It
is therefore important to rigorously pin down the necessary
conditions under which the dynamics is globally attractive,
namely the precise boundary between “when the dynamics
is analytically treatable” and “when the dynamics is not
analytically treatable”. Second, we did not characterize the
convergence speed, which is another challenging problem
because the globally attractive trajectory is time-dependent,
rendering the eigenvalue analysis of Jacobian matrix not
applicable here.

APPENDIX A
PROOF OF LEMMA 1
Proof. For proving (i), we observe that the boundedness of
B(t) means that there exists M1 > 0 such that (cid:80)n
k=1 bjk(t) ≥
−M1 holds for ∀j, ∀t. Let zi0(t)(t) = mini zi(t). It follows

(10)

this implies zi0(t)(t) ≥ 0 when z(0) ≥ 0. This means that the
solution matrix U (t, s) is nonnegative for any t ≥ s ≥ 0. It
follows from the ergodicity of {B(t)}t∈R that the convergence

holds uniformly for any a ∈ R.

For proving (ii), we observe that if G(M (B)) is strongly
connected, then there exists δ > 0 such that δ-graph of M (B)
is strongly connected. It then follows from Eq. (11) that there
exists T1 > 0, such that for any interval [kT1, (k + 1)T1) for
any k ∈ N, the δ
B(s)ds is strongly con-
kT1
nected. According to the proof of Lemma 2(2) in [45], there
exists η1 > 0 such that the η1-matrix of U ((k + 1)T1, kT1) is
irreducible. On the other hand, Inequality (10) implies that

2 -graph of (cid:82) (k+1)T1

Ujj(t, s) ≥ e−M1(t−s), ∀j.

(12)

Following the proof of Lemma 1 in [46], we know that the
product of (n − 1)-many n-dimensional nonnegative matrices,
which are irreducible and have positive diagonal elements,
gives a positive matrix. This means that there exists η2 > 0
such that

U (tk+n, tk+1) = U (tk+n, tk+n−1) · · · U (tk+2, tk+1) > η2

(13)
for ∀k ∈ N. Let T = nT1 and tk = kT , for any k ∈ N.
Then by Inequalities (12) and (13), the following holds for
any ∆ > T and any s ∈ [tN , tN +1), ∀N ∈ N:

U (s + ∆, s) =U (tN +1, s)U (tN +n, tN +1)U (s + ∆, tN +n)

≥η2e−M1(tN +1−s)e−M1(s+∆−tN +n) ≥ η2e−M1∆.

By letting (cid:15) = η2e−M1∆, we complete the proof.

APPENDIX B
PROOF OF THEOREM 3
Proof. It follows from Property 3 and Theorem 2 that f (i, y)
is strongly subhomogeneous, meaning that for any α > 0 and
i ∈ [0, 1]n, we have

When α → 0, we have f (i, y) ≤ Dif (0, y)i. This means

where Diψ(t, 0, y) is the fundamental solution matrix. Since
{y(t)}t≥0 is ergodic and the Jacobian matrix Dif (0, y)) is
bounded, Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem of random
dynamical systems (Theorems 3.4.1 and 3.4.11 in [35]) says
that there exists an invariant set ˜Y ∈ F of full measure on
which there is an Oseledets splitting Rn = E1(y)⊕· · ·⊕Er(y)
associated with ρ1 > · · · > ρr such that for k = 1, · · · , r,

Rn : (cid:107)x(cid:107) = 1}. On the other hand, it follows from Properties
1-2 and Lemma 1 that Diψ(t, 0, y) is nonnegative for all t ∈

Hence, E1(y) ⊆ Rn

to which the fundamental solution matrix is U1(s, t). Then, we
have U1(s, t) = U (t, s). It can be seen that model (16) has
Lyapunov exponents −ρj, j = 1, . . . , r. Denote the associated
Oseledets splitting subspaces by Fj(y), j = 1, . . . , r. Since

and ϕ1(t)(cid:62) ∈ F1(θ(t, y))∩Sn
it can be respectively approximated as follows:

ϕ(cid:62)
1 (t)U (t, s)φj(s) ∼ exp(ρj(t − s))ϕ(cid:62)
1 (t)U (t, s)φj(s) ∼ exp(−ρ1(s − t))ϕ(cid:62)
ϕ(cid:62)

which implies

1 (s)φj(s).

1 (t)φj(t) ∼ exp((ρ1 − ρj)(t − s))ϕ(cid:62)
ϕ(cid:62)
Since ϕ1(t) and φj(t) are bounded, we have ϕ(cid:62)
1 (t)φj(t) =
0 for all t and j (cid:54)= 1. On the other hand, from Prop-
erty 2 and G(M (Γ)) being strongly connected, we know
G(M (Dif (0, y))) is strongly connected. Then, it follows from
Lemma 1 that U (t, s) is non-negative and there exist ∆ > 0
and (cid:15)1 > 0 such that every element of U (t + ∆, t) is greater

than (cid:15)1. This means that ϕ1(t) ∈ Rn
1 when t ≥ ∆.
Then, from the compactness of [0, 1]n and Y , we have that
the angles ∠(Ej(y), Rn
>0) > η for j (cid:54)= 1 and some η > 0.
Then, we have that there exists M > 0 such that for any
ξ ∈ Rn

>0,

(cid:107)Diψ(t, 0, y)ξ(cid:107) ≥ M (cid:107)ξ(cid:107) exp(rt)

holds for some r > 0. Since Property 1 says that f (i, y) has
continuous ﬁrst and second derivatives with respect to i and
model (14) is the ﬁrst order linear approximation to model (4)
around the equilibrium 0, there exists (cid:15) > 0 and T (cid:48) > 0 such
that for any i0 ∈ Rn

>0, we have

(cid:107)ψ(t, i0, y)(cid:107) > (cid:15)

when t > T (cid:48). For an index set C ⊆ {1, · · · , n}, let

(cid:15) = {x ∈ Rn

Suppose ψ(t, i0, y) goes near Y C
(cid:15)
R|C|, it follows from the mean value theorem that

where A(t) = [Dif (ˆi, y)]C,C and I(t) = [f (˜i, y)]C with ˜i ∈
and ˆi = c˜i + (1 − c)i, c ∈ (0, 1). From the deﬁnition of
Y C
(cid:15)

and the strong connectivity of G(M (Γ)), we know there
(cid:15)
Ij(t)dt > (cid:15)(cid:48) for some
exists T1 > 0 such that maxj
(cid:15)(cid:48) > 0 and any t > 0. Let U2(t, s) denote the fundamental
solution matrix of system du(t)/dt = A(t)u(t). Lemma 1 says
that there exists T2 > 0 such that for each ∆ > T2, one can
ﬁnd (cid:15)(cid:48)(cid:48)(∆) > 0 such that U2(t + ∆, t) ≥ (cid:15)(cid:48)(cid:48)(∆). This means
that the solution to model (18) with non-negative initial value,
denoted by z(t), satisﬁes the following: For t > T1 + T2 + 1,

APPENDIX D
PROOF OF LEMMA 3

Proof. First, we prove part (i). Let Y denote the parameter
space. Note that when y ∈ Y is ergodic and Y is compact,
the conditions on Y in Theorem 1 are satisﬁed. Therefore, the
global attractivity result can be derived by employing Theorem
1 when the dynamics is uniformly persistent and satisﬁes
Conditions (I) and (II) in Theorem 1. Since the uniform
persistence of the dynamics has been proven in Lemma 2,
we only need to prove that the dynamics satisﬁes Conditions
(I) and (II) in Theorem 1.

From Property 3 and Theorem 2, we know f (i, y) is
strongly subhomogeneous. For any η ∈ (0, 1), let u1(t) =
ηψ(t, i0, y) and u2(t) = ψ(t, ηi0, y). Then, u1(t) satisﬁes

du1(t)
dt

= η

dψ(t, i0, y)
dt

= ηf (ψ(t, i0, y), y)

≤ f (ηψ(t, i0, y), y) = f (u1(t), y)

and u2(t) satisﬁes du2(t)/dt = f (u2(t), y). From the compar-
ison theory of differential equations and u1(0) = u2(0) = ηi0,
we have that u1(t) ≤ u2(t), i.e. ψ(t, ηi0, y) ≥ ηψ(t, i0, y) for
∀t, i0, y. Hence, we know that for any t ∈ R and y ∈ Y ,
ψ(t, ·, y) is subhomogeneous on [0, 1]n. Recall that we have
proved that ψ(t, i0, y) is uniformly persistent, namely that
there exists T2 such that ψ(t, i0, y) (cid:29) 0 for t ≥ T2 and
any i0, y. By the strong subhomogeneity of f (·, y), it follows
that u1(t0) (cid:28) u2(t0) for some t0 ≥ T2, implying that for any
y ∈ Y , ψ(t0, ·, y) is strongly subhomogeneous on [0, 1]n.

Note that Theorem 4.1.1 in [47] proved the monotonicity
for cooperative and irreducible dynamical systems. Here we
extend this result to our model (4). For each (i, y) ∈ [0, 1]n ×
Y , let Z(t) = ∂ψ(t, i, y)/∂i. Then, we have

dZ(t)
dt

= B(t)Z(t), where B(t) = Dif (i, y).

It follows from Lemma 1 that every element of Z(t) is

This implies that for each C ⊂ {1, · · · , n} and a sufﬁciently
small (cid:15) > 0, there exists υC,(cid:15) > 0 such that for each iC,0 ∈

First,
inequality (17) implies that

≥0 : (cid:107)x(cid:107) ≤
(cid:15)}. So, there exists at least one index, say j(t), such that
[ψ(t, i0, y)]j(t) > (cid:15)1 = (cid:15)/n for any sufﬁciently large t. If
ψ(t, i0, y) goes near Y Cj
(cid:15)1 where Cj = {1, · · · , n} − {j(t)},
the preceding analysis indicates that [ψ(t, i0, y)]Cj essentially

,

C⊂{1,··· ,n}

meaning that ψ(t, i0, y) is persistent for any i0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0}.
Now it can be concluded that ψ(t, i0, y) is persistent for any
i0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0} and almost all y ∈ Y .

For any i0,ˆi0 (cid:29) 0, we can always ﬁnd η ∈ (0, 1) such
that ηi0 ≤ ˆi0 ≤ η−1i0. Then, by the subhomogeneity and
monotonicity of ψ(t, ·, y) on [0, 1]n, we know that for any
t ∈ R,

ηψ(t, i0, y) ≤ ψ(t,ˆi0, y) ≤ η−1ψ(t, i0, y).

From the strongly subhomogeneity of ψ(t0, ·, y), it follows
ηψ(t0, i0, y) (cid:28) ψ(t0,ˆi0, y) (cid:28) η−1ψ(t0, i0, y).

This means Conditions (I) and (II) in Theorem 1 are satisﬁed.
This completes the proof of part (i).

Now we prove part (ii). From αv(t) = 0, hv(i(t), βv(t)) ≤
1, gv(i(t), αv(t), Γ(t)) ≥ 0 for ∀v ∈ V and t ≥ 0, we know
div(t)
dt ≥ −iv(t) always holds, implying iv(t) ≥ exp(−t)iv(0).
It follows that when iv(0) > 0, iv(t) > 0 holds for any t ≥ 0.
From the strong connectivity of G(M (Γ)) and Property 2, we

know there exists T1 > 0 such that iv(T1) > 0 for any v ∈ V .
Therefore, for any i0,ˆi0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0}, we can ﬁnd η ∈ (0, 1)
such that

ηψ(T1, i0, y) ≤ ψ(T1,ˆi0, y) ≤ η−1ψ(T1, i0, y).

(21)

By combing with the subhomogeneous and monotonicity of
ψ(t, ·, y) on [0, 1]n, we have that for t ≥ T1,

ηψ(t, i0, y) ≤ ψ(t,ˆi0, y) ≤ η−1ψ(t, i0, y).

(22)

APPENDIX E
PROOF OF LEMMA 4
Proof. From hv(i(t), βv(t)) ≤ 1 and gv(i(t), αv(t), Γ(t)) ≥
αv(t), we know that for t ≥ 0,

div(t)
dt

≥ −iv(t) + αv(t) (1 − iv(t)) ≥ −2iv(t) + αv(t).

It follows from M (αv) > 0 that there exist δ1 > 0 and T0 > 0
such that

(cid:90) (k+1)T0

kT0

αv0(s)ds ≥ δ1

From the strong subhomogeneity of solution ψ(t0, ·, y) proven
in the preceding part (i), we have that for any n ≥ 1, n ∈ N,

holds for any k ∈ N. Then for t ∈ [N T0, (N + 1)T0) and
N ∈ N, we have

ηψ(nT0 + T1, i0, y) (cid:28)ψ(nT0 + T1,ˆi0, y)

(cid:28)η−1ψ(nT0 + T1, i0, y).

(23)

We recall the metric ρ(·, ·) given in [40]:

ρ(i0,ˆi0) = inf{ln η |η ≥ 1, η−1i0 ≤ ˆi0 ≤ ηi0},
∀i0,ˆi0 ∈ (0, 1]n.

Let X = [0, 1]n. For any y ∈ Y , we deﬁne ˆρ : X → R+ as

ˆρ(i0,ˆi0) = ρ(ψ(T1, i0, y), ψ(T1,ˆi0, y))

for ∀i0,ˆi0 ∈ X\{0}, ˆρ(i0, 0) = +∞ and ˆρ(0, 0) = 0. It can
be seen that (X, ˆρ) is a metric space and ˆρ(·, ·) is continuous
with respect to the product topology induced by the norm
(cid:107) · (cid:107). Moreover, inequalities (21) and (22) imply that for any
i0,ˆi0 ∈ X\{0} and t ≥ T1,

ˆρ(ψ(t, i0, y), ψ(t,ˆi0, y)) ≤ ˆρ(i0,ˆi0),

(24)

while inequalities (21) and (23) imply that for any i0,ˆi0 ∈
X\{0} with i0 (cid:54)= ˆi0 and n ≥ 1, n ∈ N,

ˆρ(ψ(nT0, +T1, i0, y), ψ(nT0, +T1, ,ˆi0, y)) < ˆρ(i0,ˆi0).

Since X and Y are compact, we have that any trajectory

(ψ(t, i0, y), θ(t, y)) has its ω-limit set K0 ⊆ X × Y .

If K0|X (cid:54)= {0}, similar to the proof of Theorem 2.3.5 in
[40] (Theorem 1 in the present paper), we can prove that for
any y0 ∈ K0|Y , the cardinality of set p−1(y0) ∩ K0 is one,
i.e., there is only one point i∗ ∈ K0|X satisﬁes (i∗, y0) ∈ K0.
For any trajectory with any nonzero initial value, its ω-limit
set equals K0. This implies that for any y ∈ Y , model (4) is
globally attractive.

If there exists y0 ∈ Y such that ψ(t, i∗
y0

, y0) ∈ (0, 1]n,
then K0|X ⊆ (0, 1]n. Notice that for any trajectory with any
nonzero initial value, its ω-limit set equals K0, implying that
ψ(t, i∗

y, y) ∈ (0, 1]n holds for almost every y ∈ Y .

If K0|X = {0}, then by inequality (24) and the assumption
that ˆρ(0, i0) = +∞, we have that for any trajectory with
any nonzero initial value, its omega limit set equals K0. This
implies that the equilibrium 0 is globally attractive.

Finally, part (iii) follows from Theorem 3 immediately.

prove that for any v ∈ {1, · · · , n}, there exists δ(cid:48)(cid:48) > 0 and
T (cid:48) > 0 such that iv(t) ≥ δ(cid:48)(cid:48). In other words, all trajectories
are uniformly persistent. On the other hand, it follows from
the proof of Lemma 3 that ψ(t, ·, y) satisﬁes Conditions (I)
and (II) in Theorem 1, meaning that model (4) is globally
attractive.

APPENDIX F
PROOF OF LEMMA 5
Proof. First, we prove part (i) of Lemma 5. The global
attractivity for the dynamics corresponding to strongly con-
nected component SCC1 can be derived from Lemmas 3 and
4 directly. Let φ(t, i∗
, y) denote the globally attractive

SCC1

trajectory corresponding to SCC1. For any given ergodic
function z(t) ∈ [0, 1]|SCC1|, the system

div(t)
dt

= fv([z(t), [i(t)]SCC2] , y), v ∈ SCC2

(26)

has a globally attractive trajectory in [0, 1]|SCC2|\{0} by
treating (y(t), z(t)) as enlarged parameters.

Let {(cid:15)k}k∈N be a positive and monotone decreasing se-
quence that converges to 0. Then, by the global attractivity
of SCC1, we have that for any i2,0 ∈ [0, 1]|SCC2| and any
there exists Tk > 0 such that for t > Tk and any
(cid:15)k,
i1,0 ∈ [0, 1]|SCC1|,

trajectory we are seeking for SCC1 ∪ SCC2.

Let Vα=0 = {v : αv(t) = 0, ∀t ∈ R} denote the set
of nodes that are not subject to pull-based attacks, meaning
that M (αv) = 0. Therefore, V can be partitioned into
two sets such that V = Vα=0 ∪ Vα>0. This means that
VSCC2 ∩ Vα>0 = ∅ is equivalent to VSCC2 ⊆ Vα=0, namely
that αv(t) = 0, ∀v ∈ VSCC2. When φ(t, i∗
, y) = 0|SCC1|,
VSCC2 ∩ Vα>0 = ∅ and µ(Df22) < 0, the global attractiv-
ity trajectory corresponding to SCC2, i.e., [ψ(t, i∗, y)]SCC2
satisﬁes system (26) with z(t) = 0|SCC1|. Then it follows
from part (iii) of Lemma 3 that SSC2 globally converges to
0|SCC2|. This completed the proof of proves part (i) of Lemma

proof of part (ii) of Lemma 5.

Proof. We
graph G(M (Γ))
into K strongly
by
denoted
SCC1, · · · , SCCK. Let VSCCk denote the set of nodes
in SCCk and |SCCk| the number of the nodes in SCCk,
k = 1, · · · , K. Let Rk be the indices of SCCs that have links
pointing to SCCk. This means that if Rk (cid:54)= ∅ and j ∈ Rk,
there exists a node in SCCj that has a path to a node in SCCk.
From Properties 2 and ∂fv(0, y)/∂iv = ∂gv(0, αv, Γ)/∂iv,
we know that the Jacobian matrix Dif (0, y) has the Perron-
Frobenius form (9). Following the argument in the proof of
Lemma 5, we can use induction to prove that for each SCCk,
• 0|SCCk| is globally attractive in [0, 1]n if either of the

following condition holds:

– VSCCk ∩ Vα>0 = ∅, µ(Dfkk) < 0 and Rk = ∅;
– VSCCk ∩ Vα>0 = ∅, µ(Dfkk) < 0, Rk (cid:54)= ∅ and
0|SCCr| is globally attractive for every r ∈ Rk.
• SCCk has a positive trajectory that is globally attractive
in [0, 1]|SCCk|\{0} if one of the following condition
holds:

– VSCCk ∩ Vα>0 = ∅, µ(Dfkk) > 0 and Rk = ∅;
– Rk (cid:54)= ∅ and there exists j ∈ Rk such that SCCj has

a positive and globally attractive trajectory.
• SCCk has a positive trajectory that is globally attractive

in [0, 1]|SCCk| if VSCCk ∩ Vα>0 (cid:54)= ∅.

• SCCk has a trajectory that

is globally attractive in
[0, 1]|SCCk|\{0} if VSCCk ∩Vα>0 = ∅ and µ(Dfkk) ≥ 0.
Therefore, it can be concluded that for V = ∪K
k=1VSCCk , there
exists a globally attractive trajectory ψ(t, i∗, y) ∈ [0, 1]n\{0}.
Moreover, following the argument in the proof of Lemma
4, we know that if node v is subject to pull-based attacks,
the trajectory of node v is uniformly persistent,
implying
[ψ(t, i∗, y)]v (cid:54)= 0.

APPENDIX H
PROOF OF THEOREM 5

Proof. For the almost periodic function y = {y(t)}t∈R, let
Y0 be the closure of {θ(s, y), s ∈ R} and F0 be the Borel σ-
algebra of Y0. The normalized Haar measure of Y0, denoted by
P0, is the unique θ-invariant and ergodic probability measure
[35]. By Deﬁnition 1, {y(t)}t∈R is ergodic with respect to the
probability space (Y0, F0, P0). Then it follows from Theorem
4 that for almost every y0 ∈ Y0, there is a globally attractive
trajectory in [0, 1]n\{0}. Suppose for y1 = θ(t1, y) ∈ Y0,
there is a globally attractive trajectory ψ(t, i∗
1, y1), namely that
limt→∞ (cid:107)ψ(t, i0, y1)−ψ(t, i∗
1, y1)(cid:107) = 0 for ∀i0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0}.
Let i∗ = ψ(−t1, i∗
1, y1). Then,

ψ(t1, i∗, y) = ψ(t1, ψ(−t1, i∗

1, y1), y) = ψ(0, i∗

1, y1) = i∗
1.

18

For any i0 ∈ [0, 1]n\{0} and t > t1, we have

(cid:107)ψ(t, i0, y) − ψ(t, i∗, y)(cid:107)

=(cid:107)ψ(t − t1, ψ(t1, i0, y), y1) − ψ(t − t1, i∗

1, y1)(cid:107),

implying that ψ(t, i∗, y) is globally attractive.

Now we prove the existence of an almost periodic solution.
From almost periodicity of y(t) (see Deﬁnition 2), it follows
that there exists l > 0 such that any l-length interval contains
a constant ξ > 0 so that (cid:107)y(t + ξ) − y(t)(cid:107) ≤ (cid:15) holds for
all t ∈ R, namely ξ is an (cid:15)-translation number of y(t). By
the global attractivity of model (4) and the almost periodicity
of y(·), it follows that for any constant M > 0, there exists
T > 0 such that for any t > T ,

(cid:107)ψ(t + ξ, i, y) − ψ(t, i, y)(cid:107)

=(cid:107)ψ(t, ψ(ξ, i, y), θ(ξ, y)) − ψ(t, i, y)(cid:107)

≤(cid:107)ψ(t, ψ(ξ, i, y), θ(ξ, y)) − ψ(t, i, θ(ξ, y))(cid:107)

+ (cid:107)ψ(t, i, θ(ξ, y)) − ψ(t, i, y)(cid:107)

≤M (cid:15).

That is, ψ(t, i, y) is asymptotically almost periodic.

Taking {tk}k∈N such that

|f (i, y(t)) − f (i, y(t + tk))| < 1/k

sup
t,i

and considering the solution ψ(t + tk, i, y) to di(t)/dt =
f (i, y(t + tk)), ∀k ∈ N. According to Lemma 2 in [48], we
know that there exists a sub-sequence of {ψ(t + tk, i, y)}k∈N,
denoted by ψ(t + tk, i, y) for not to introduce extra notations,
that converges uniformly and its limit at k → ∞, denoted by
ψ∗(t, i, y), is a solution to model (4). Since ψ(t + tk, i, y) is
asymptotically almost periodic, i.e., |ψ(t + tk + ξ, i, y) − ψ(t +
tk, i, y)| ≤ M (cid:15) for sufﬁciently large k, it follows that the limit
ψ∗(t, i, y) is almost periodic in t and ξ is an M (cid:15)-translation
number of ψ∗(t, i, y).

By the Gronwall inequality [49], we obtain the bounds of iv(t).
This completes the proof.
