ABSTRACT The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) is rapidly increasing in electric power
systems (EPS). While the inclusion of intermittent RES coupled with the wide-scale deployment of
communication and sensing devices is important towards a fully smart grid, it has also expanded the
cyber-threat landscape, effectively making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This paper proposes
a cybersecurity assessment approach designed to assess the cyberphysical security of EPS. The work takes
into consideration the intermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by microprocessor-based
electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT) devices, and contingency analysis results. The
proposed approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the optimal
attack transition policy based on N − 2 contingency results, i.e., the simultaneous failure of two system
elements. The effectiveness of the work is validated via numerical and real-time simulation experiments
performed on literature-based power grid test cases. The results demonstrate how the proposed method
based on deep Q-network (DQN) performs closely to a graph-search approach in terms of the number of
transitions needed to ﬁnd the optimal attack policy, without the need for full observation of the system. In
addition, the experiments present the method’s scalability by showcasing the number of transitions needed
to ﬁnd the optimal attack transition policy in a large system such as the Polish 2383 bus test system. The
results exhibit how the proposed approach requires one order of magnitude fewer transitions when compared
to a random transition policy.

I. INTRODUCTION

The power grid is the cornerstone of all critical infrastruc-
tures. The safe and secure functionality of electric power sys-
tems (EPS) is directly related to every aspect of the economy
and society. In the last decades, worldwide energy demand
has signiﬁcantly increased and is estimated to continue to do
so by nearly 50% by 2050 [1]. Due to the increasing energy
demand as well as the need to enhance system efﬁciency
and asset reliability, the technological modernization of the
power grid infrastructure has become an immediate priority
for governments and energy stakeholders around the world
[2]. This modernization, alongside environmental concerns,
are driving factors for the integration of renewable energy

sources (RES) to the power grid. For example, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicates that, in
2019, the wind was responsible for generating approximately
42% of RES generated power at utility-scale facilities in
the U.S., and 7.3% of the total U.S. electricity generation,
making it the most popular RES [3]. Even though wind
integration aids in accommodating the increasing power de-
mand, its intermittent nature introduces challenges related
to the mismatch between supply and demand. For instance,
short-term wind power ﬂuctuations occur on a second or
sub-second timescale during which load balancing methods
do not yet operate. Thus, to ensure system stability, critical
aspects such as optimal location, power ﬂow, and generation

variance must be taken into consideration when interconnect-
ing wind energy systems.

Traditionally, contingency analysis has been used to assess
physical power system security in EPS [4]. This is achieved
by calculating the power ﬂow of all the system elements in
the event of single or multiple failures. In essence, a con-
tingency is the failure or loss of any element such as a circuit
breaker, generator, or transmission line. Contingencies can be
planned or unplanned. Planned contingencies include events
resulting from scheduled maintenance and proactive emer-
gency preparedness, while unplanned events include ﬂuctu-
ating wind injections, cyberattacks, human errors, etc. The
North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) re-
quires system operators to meet the N − 1 security constraint
and classiﬁes systems into four main categories [5]. These
categories are shown in Table 1.

The intermittent nature of wind power generates chal-
lenges when performing security studies of power sys-
tems based on contingency analysis. Their intermittency can
rapidly change the most critical contingencies of the system
or create a number of contingencies (λ) that exceeds the max-
imum number of contingencies that the system can handle
(k); thus leading to cascading scenarios. A prime example of
insufﬁcient security margins is the widespread power outage
across the U.K. in 2019 [6]. The near-simultaneous loss
of two-generation sites, one being an offshore wind farm
and the other one a gas-ﬁred power station, resulted in a
massive under-frequency event. Load shedding mechanisms
responded immediately causing a major disturbance that
affected nearly one million people.

Additionally, the power grid is experiencing a rapid move
towards a more interconnected system. Operational technol-
ogy (OT) electronic devices are deployed and operated at
all scales of the power system and are often being designed
and retroﬁtted with information technology (IT) devices to
support communication processes and protocols that en-
hance the controllability and observability of the system.
The use of such digital electronic devices with software
applications [7], modules, drivers, commercial-off-the-shelf
(COTS) hardware [8], and network resources is a double-
edged sword [9]. On one hand, it assists in the development of
the future modern and advanced grid in terms of optimizing
asset utilization, addressing disturbances, providing better
power quality, and accommodating all storage and generation
options with grid-support functions. On the other hand, the
coupling between such cyber-electronic devices and physical
components in power systems has altered the threat model
[10], [11].

In the past, the threat model has been solely focused on
physical threats. However, due to the integration of such
network-controlled components, the security challenges need
to consider both the cyber and physical nature of the grid,
addressing the growing number of emerging threats [12].
Some examples of these potential threats are presented in
[13]–[15], where it has been demonstrated that attackers
can leverage publicly available sources by using open-source
intelligence (OSINT) techniques combined with open-source
exploitation methods in order to spoof GPS signals of phasor
measurement units (PMUs). Another example is presented in
[16], where a real-world attack within the Ukrainian power
system is accomplished by injecting malicious ﬁrmware in
serial-to-Ethernet gateways at targeted substations. Attackers
were able to trip circuit breakers and cause a blackout that
affected approximately 225,000 customers.

In this work, we provide an effective way for system
operators, at both the local and international level, to assess
the cyberphysical security of EPS, which takes into consid-
eration wind uncertainty together with cyber-based aspects
such as quantitative scoring systems of vulnerabilities identi-
ﬁed in IT/OT devices supporting the grid infrastructure. The
assessment follows a step-by-step process, from an attacker’s
point of view, designed to identify the most critical system
points an adversary can leverage to compromise the targeted
EPS. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

(1) We propose a cybersecurity assessment approach that
considers adversaries that make use of OSINT modeling
techniques to construct power system models. Such mod-
els are then used in tandem with contingency analysis that
takes into account wind intermittent generation to identify
the critical cyber and physical vulnerabilities of the EPS.
The assessment process is performed without the need for
full observability of the system since it models the state of
the power system as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that is solved using deep Q-networks
(DQNs). The solution given by the proposed DQN reveals
the optimal attack transition policy an adversary would fol-
low to potentially induce cascading failures in the assessed
cyberphysical EPS.

(2) We propose an adapted version of the Common Vulner-
ability Scoring System (CVSS) based on contingency analy-
sis results and information from the power and communica-
tion networks that reveal cyber and physical vulnerabilities
within system nodes. The adapted CVSS is used to generate
a transition graph designed to assess the complexity of each
possible attack path based on various adversarial strategies.

(3) We evaluate the performance of the proposed method-
ology using real-time simulations on test power systems
highlighting the method’s scalability. Our results showcase
that a fewer number of transitions is needed compared to a
random transition policy in order to ﬁnd the optimal attack
transition.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section

proach. Section IV presents contingency analysis studies for
various power system test cases using real-time simulation.
In Section V, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed cybersecurity assessment approach and compare it to
different transition techniques. Finally, Section VI concludes

II. RELATED WORK

In this part, we explore some of the state-of-the-art ap-
proaches being proposed by researchers that aim to ad-
dress issues related to (1) N − k contingencies simulations
considering intermittent RES generation, (2) assessing the
severity of electronic devices security vulnerabilities, and (3)
vulnerability and risk assessments methods for cyberphysical
EPS.

1) Methods for N − k Contingency Analysis

Towards reducing the occurrence of cascading failures, ex-
isting research efforts have focused on proposing efﬁcient
methods that can perform studies based on N −k contingency
scenarios. Due to the size and complexity of power systems,
these “what-if” contingency scenarios are based on compu-
tationally expensive optimal power ﬂow processes. Research
in this area aims to address the computational overhead of
N !/[k!(N − k)!] simulations for N − k contingencies. For
example, the work in [17] describes a fast-bounding case
which requires a small online memory model. Other efforts
compute the active power ﬂow change at lines and the voltage
change at buses to evaluate the severity of N − 1 and N − 2
contingencies [18]. In [19], a graph-based power model anal-
ysis is presented for contingency ranking. In [20], a heuristics
pruning approach for identifying N − k contingencies is
discussed while a topology-based algorithm that considers
whether the generator or line is in densely populated areas is
presented in [21]. The authors use the concepts of closeness
and betweenness centrality to determine the component’s
importance for a N − k criterion.

One of the main challenges of performing contingency
studies in power systems with high penetration of wind is
that the uncertain nature of wind causes high variability when
identifying the most critical N − k contingencies of the sys-
tem. Existing studies do not often take into account this vari-
ability [22]–[24]. The authors in [23] and [25] demonstrate
some of the effects that intermittent power generation has in
critical contingency identiﬁcation. They present probabilistic
power ﬂow studies that show how the variable nature of
power ﬂow, due to wind ﬂuctuations and uncertainties, can al-
ter the number and location of the most critical contingencies
recognized by system operators. The correct identiﬁcation of
these critical contingencies is of paramount importance as
they can be potentially leveraged by adversaries in order to
cause major disruptions in EPS [26], [27].

2) Severity Assessment of Electronic Devices Security
Vulnerabilities
The wide-scale integration of information and communica-
tion technologies in the form of digital electronic devices
into the electrical grid expands the list of possible attack vec-
tors that adversaries could exploit to cause major disruptive
events. Hence, in order to ensure the secure operation of the
entire system, it is essential to consider the inherent vulner-
abilities introduced by the grid-supporting IT/OT infrastruc-
ture. One scoring system that is widely used for device-level
vulnerability assessments in the IT industry is CVSS [28].
The CVSS can assess the severity of software, hardware,
and ﬁrmware vulnerabilities by using numerical scores. One
example of its use can be found in [29]. Here, the authors
utilize CVSS to estimate the probability of successfully
exploiting identiﬁed independent vulnerabilities, including
zero-days, existing in components connected to the LAN of
a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.
Another example of CVSS use can be found in [30], where a
CVSS-based cyber asset impact score is presented providing
a real-time cyber impact severity score that can be used
as a basis for processes such as vulnerability management,
isolation of cyber assets, and system reconﬁguration.

3) Vulnerability and Risk Assessment Methods for
Cyberphysical EPS
Several researchers have focused on developing system-wide
security assessment tools aimed to identify possible vulner-
abilities and attack vectors which can be subsequently used
to produce optimal control policies designed to guide secure
operations of cyberphysical EPS. The work presented in
[31], proposes power system emergency control mechanisms
based on DQNs to maintain the reliable operation of the
system by performing dynamic breaking of generation and
under-voltage load shedding. Other researchers have also
made use of DQNs to perform cybersecurity analysis studies
in EPS. One example is presented in [32], where the au-
thors propose a DQN-based cyberphysical topology attack
designed to trip critically-targeted transmission lines with
the objective of exceeding power ﬂow line constraints in the
system. This research demonstrates how the disconnection
of essential transmission lines could cause system collapse,
and how attackers can ﬁnd out what type of topology attack
needs to be performed in order to cause cascading failures.
A similar approach is taken by researchers in [33], where
a robust DQN-based contingency management mechanism
is proposed to provide remedial action when contingencies
exist in the system.

Other works have focused on more traditional ranking
mechanisms to improve EPS cybersecurity. For example, the
research presented in [21] assesses system vulnerability from
the cyberphysical security perspective using contingency
ranking methods and a cyber-intrusion ranking methodology.
Similarly, in [34], an operational reliability impact assess-
ment framework has been developed. In this study, the au-
thors incorporate cyberphysical threats in the assessment of

the EPS operation. Another approach is presented in [35],
describing an overload risk assessment method based on
N − 1 contingency analysis and wind penetration.

Compared to the existing work, our proposed cybersecu-
rity assessment approach assesses the cyberphysical security
of EPS leveraging the use of deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) paradigms while considering the intrinsic interactions
between the system’s network and physical components. Our
work considers physical-based aspects, such as contingency
analysis and wind uncertainty, together with network-based
aspects, such as vulnerabilities stemming from OSINT meth-
ods. The proposed assessment framework reveals potential
threats that can be utilized by attackers to cause serious
disruptions in EPS, and at the same time, assist system
operators to prioritize the deployment of cybersecurity mech-
anisms, and thus, contribute towards reducing the risk of
cyberattacks.

III. CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY
In this section, we provide the methodology of the proposed
approach. Fig. 1 shows the step-by-step process that our
cybersecurity assessment approach follows. In step 1, the
assessment process determines the threat model based on
the adversary objectives and capabilities. Speciﬁcally, our
work considers an attacker that leverages OSINT techniques.
The OSINT methods are utilized in step 2 in order to run
contingency analysis with the objective of identifying the set
of k critical contingencies of the system. Our results focus
on two contingencies that assess the power system condition
when two components are lost, i.e., k = 2. However, the
proposed approach can be extended to consider a higher
number of contingencies. To proceed with the assessment
process without the need for full system observability [36], in
step 3, the proposed approach creates a POMDP by deﬁning
a transition probability (T P ) based on the proposed adapted
version of the CVSS score metric. The score evaluates the
difﬁculty of each network transition in the generated system
graph. Then, in step 4, the POMDP is solved using a DRL
model designed to ﬁnd the optimal attack policy between
the previously identiﬁed contingencies. Finally, the output
of the cybersecurity assessment process evaluates the poten-

tial threat by revealing the optimal attack transition policy
between the identiﬁed contingency pair which could cause
cascading failures in the physical system. The details of each
step are presented in the following subsections.

A. STEP 1: THREAT MODEL
OSINT refers to a collection of techniques and method-
ologies that can be used to gather, analyze, and exploit
publicly available information (e.g., public government data,
commercial data, social media, etc.) to characterize aspects
of a particular target system. Existing work has demonstrated
that the U.S. power grid infrastructure could be effectively
proﬁled using OSINT techniques [37], [38]. Following a sim-
ilar approach, we consider a threat model where an attacker
can leverage publicly available information using OSINT
methods to collect sufﬁcient EPS data (e.g., line parameters,
the status and location of circuit breakers, system topology,
generation sites and capacity, etc.). Also, the attacker is
able to acquire data to calculate power ﬂow and therefore
run contingency analysis [14]. Depending on the degree
of system contingencies (e.g., N − 1 secure system), the
adversary can leverage the ranking results of contingency
algorithms to identify which system elements if “removed”
can lead to an insecure power system state. Although a
plethora of public power system information is available, it
is unlikely that the attacker will ever have full knowledge
and real-time observability of the system [39]. In our ap-
proach, it is assumed that the attacker, in spite of having
the necessary information to perform contingency analysis
via OSINT techniques, he/she does not have the full state
information of the system. Speciﬁcally, while the adversarial
agent is transitioning through the cyber system network to
exploit vulnerabilities in the identiﬁed double contingency
nodes, he/she is unaware of his/her position relative to the
contingencies and the cyber network transition complexities
(based on the adapted CVSS) of the different attack paths.

In addition, we assume that the cyber system network
graph is isomorphic with the physical system graph, indi-
cating that the topology of the communication network is
mapped with the topology of the physical system. Therefore,
we model the environment as a POMDP in which the agent

may only access the current state and make an observation
for obtaining possible actions in each state (Step 3). Based
on the observation results for each state-action combination,
the network T P is calculated. This probability reveals the
transition complexity between different states. By leveraging
this methodology, a DQN-based algorithm is then utilized
to identify the optimal attack transition policy between the
critical contingency elements (Step 4).

B. STEP 2: CONTINGENCY ANALYSIS
In order to ﬁnd the attacker’s optimal attack transition policy,
we ﬁrst need to identify the set of critical double contin-
gencies of the physical power system (e.g., simultaneous
N − 2 or consecutively N − 1 − 1). We utilize a fast pruning
N − 2 algorithm to ﬁnd all the thermal constraint violations
via linear power ﬂow approximation [40]. The algorithm is
initiated based on the set of all N − 2 pairs. The contingency
candidate list is pruned using line outage distribution factors
(LODFs). LODFs describe the power ﬂow impact on other
lines when a line outage occurs. The pruning approach is
based on the thermal constraints of lines, running until the
number of contingencies included in the set does not change.
If the LODF exceeds its thermal constraint, it is added to the
contingency candidate set. The line overload condition can
be written as Axy · Bxc + Ayx · Byc > 1, where x and y are
lines experiencing outages, z is an arbitrary line experiencing
power ﬂow changes, and c is a possible constraint. Matrix
Axy can be calculated by Axy = (1 + Lxy · fy/fx)/(1 −
Lyx · Lxy), where L is the LODF shown in Eq. (1). This
equation describes the change in the ﬂow through line x,
where fx is the original ﬂow, and f (cid:48)
x is the ﬂow after the
outage. Correspondingly, fy represents the ﬂow through line
y before the line is tripped. Matrix Bxc is calculated by

C. STEP 3: POMDP TRANSITION MODEL BASED ON
ADAPTED CVSS
After ﬁnding the most critical contingency set, the pro-
cess advances to create the corresponding POMDP of the
cyberphysical-graph environment by calculating the corre-
sponding T P between the different nodes of the system.
Generally, POMDPs are used to model the response and
outcomes of systems when different actions are performed at
speciﬁc states. In our environment, observations made by the
attacker do not provide full state information, i.e., the agent

does not know apriori how many nodes the system has nor
their respective states, and he/she needs to observe the envi-
ronment to determine potential actions, hence the selection of
POMDP system modeling. POMDPs can be mathematically
modeled as a 6-tuple (S, A, Ω, P, R, O), where S is the set
of all possible states in a given environment, A contains
all the agent’s potential actions, Ω is a set which includes
all possible observations, P is the T P for each state, R is
the reward function for performing different actions, and O
represents conditional observation probabilities. The notation
of POMDP tuples is summarized in Table. 2. At the current
state s, given the T P and observation o, the agent takes
action a to move to the next state s(cid:48). As a result of this
state-action pair, the agent receives reward R. This process
repeats until the terminal state is reached. In this POMDP
formulation, the T P for each state is an essential factor
that must be determined adequately according to the process
being modeled. In our case, the T P relies on the cyber system
vulnerabilities, i.e., vulnerabilities that exist in electronic
devices, and their potential impacts related to the physical
system, i.e., the identiﬁed power system contingencies.

Considering the cyber network system vulnerabilities as
well as the optimal attack transition policy between the
identiﬁed contingencies (physical vulnerabilities), a T P for
each transition step (between cyberphysical system nodes)
can be determined. These probabilities aid in the traversal
agent’s decision making since the values reveal the differ-
ence in complexity and difﬁculty for each transition, i.e.,
how vulnerable is the cyberphysical system at each node,
i.e., bus, from the point of view of the attacker transition
policy. In each step, the node’s identiﬁed cyber and physical
characteristics including the electronic device vulnerabilities,
thermal limits of lines, and power generation are considered.
A graphical illustration of this procedure is shown in Fig. 2.
In this work, we compute the T P using an adapted version
of CVSS v3.1.

CVSS is a vulnerability scoring system generally used in
the IT industry to assess the severity of the identiﬁed com-
puter system’s vulnerabilities. Although there exist temporal
and environmental metrics in CVSS, their main aim is to
reﬂect how vulnerabilities change over time or demonstrate
uniqueness to a particular user’s environment [28]. For our
application, base metrics portray a better picture regarding
how the cyber and physical vulnerabilities at each power
system node affect the transition difﬁculty of the threat. More
speciﬁcally, the base score provides a comprehensive assess-

direct path to the vulnerable element is required (e.g., local
terminal, remote terminal, or deceive legitimate users into
executing malicious instructions). In an EPS, this type of
attack could be performed by executing malicious code in
local control or monitoring electronic devices accessed via
a local or remote terminal. Finally, for a physical attack,
actual physical interaction between the attacker and the target
is necessary. In an EPS, this means that the attacker must
compromise the targeted electronic devices through physical
means (e.g., causing physical damage to the devices).

b) Attack Complexity (AC) – This metric represents the
amount of effort an attack on the vulnerable electronic device
would require. The value of this metric, high or low, depends
on the security level of the electronic devices as well as the
adversary’s capabilities and skills. In EPS, generation buses
can be considered of more signiﬁcance than load buses in
regards to power grid operation and, consequently, possi-
ble threats. Typically, additional security mechanisms are in
place to protect bulk generation infrastructure [42]. This is
accomplished by using electronic security devices, physical
barriers, or security monitoring equipment. Hence, as part
of our CVSS vulnerability scoring, P V and P Q buses are
considered of high and low attack complexity, respectively.

c) User Interaction (UI) – This metric reveals whether user
interaction is required to exploit a certain electronic device. It
quantiﬁes the amount of participation required from a human
user, different from the attacker, to successfully compromise
the targeted device. For example, attackers could attempt to
deceive the system operator to give them access to the control
room via phishing or malware attacks. Due to the importance
of P V buses, we assume that the attacker will require UI
to manipulate a P V bus. On the contrary, it is assumed that
attackers would not need to obtain special permission from
another human user to access P Q buses. The values for this
metric are: required for P V buses, and none for P Q buses.

d) Privileges Required (PR) – This metric determines the
level of privileges needed to carry out an attack, i.e., it eval-
uates the level of privileges that are required by the attacker
before successfully compromising the vulnerable electronic
device. Similarly to the previous metric, we designate its
values according to the type of power system bus being
evaluated: high for P V buses, and low for P Q buses.

e) Scope (S) – This metric demonstrates whether or not
compromising a particular electronic device will cause im-
plications beyond its security scope. If the scope metric is
deﬁned as changed, attacking the corresponding electronic
device will result in a detrimental implication beyond its se-
curity scope, i.e., will affect the other elements in the system.
If the scope is deﬁned as unchanged, it will only cause im-
plications to elements under the same security scope. In our
context, when a P Q bus is attacked, no major disturbances
are observed in other system’s elements since generation
is not directly affected, thus its scope can be deﬁned as
unchanged. However, if a P V bus is compromised, more
severe effects on surrounding nodes of the physical EPS
network, caused by power stability issues, are observed. In

ment of the intrinsic characteristics of identiﬁed vulnerabil-
ities using quantitative Exploitability and Impact metrics as
shown in Fig. 3. The range of scores goes from 0 to 10, with
10 being the most severe – maximum value.

1) Exploitability Metric
This metric describes the difﬁculty and technical means by
which software, hardware, or ﬁrmware vulnerability can be
exploited. In our case, the exploitability represents the difﬁ-
culty of vulnerability exploitation for each electronic device
that exists in a particular node of the cyber-layer of the
power system. In other words, it represents the complexity
of the transition based on the type of node (i.e., P Q or P V
power system bus) to which the agent is transitioning to. The
overall score of this metric is determined by ﬁve sub-metrics,
described below.

a) Attack Vector (AV) – This metric is deﬁned as one of
the following categories: network, adjacent network, local
network, or physical. In a network attack, an adversary
exploits a vulnerable device bound to the network stack.
This type of attack is conducted through the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) layer 3. In an EPS, an attacker may
conduct a network attack by manipulating TCP-level packets
ﬂowing across a substation network. In an adjacent attack,
the adversary also exploits vulnerable devices bound to the
network stack. However, the attack cannot be performed
across the boundary of OSI layer 3. In essence, the attack
is limited to the same shared physical or logical network. An
example of this type of attack is an Address Resolution Pro-

this case, the scenario needs to be characterized by changed
scope.

Following the description of the exploitability metrics,
Table 3 shows a detailed comparison between the metrics
values found in different available scoring systems. These
scoring systems are the CVSS v3.1 [28], CVSS v2.0 [43],
and the Industrial Vulnerability Scoring System (IVSS) [44].
CVSS v3.1 is the most up to date scoring system which
provides the most accurate way of capturing the main char-
acteristics of vulnerability via numerical scores. IVSS is an
outdated scoring system and not widely used and supported
by the community. Other quantitative risk assessment scoring
systems, such as CCSS [45] and CMSS [46], were also
considered when selecting the appropriate scoring system.
However, all of these scoring systems are based on the
previous version of CVSS, i.e., CVSS v2.0.

2) Impact Metric
In CVSS, the impact metric is used to evaluate different
exploitation methods and capture the effects of successfully
exploited vulnerabilities. This metric is determined using
three factors: conﬁdentiality (C), i.e., the effect on system
information disclosure, integrity (In), i.e., how detrimental
the modiﬁcation of system data would be, and availability
(A), i.e., the system accessibility after an adverse effect has
occurred. During an attack, an adversary can cause high,
low, or no impact in each speciﬁed factor. For our study, the
impact metric is designed to capture the effect of different
exploited vulnerabilities in the EPS. During an attack on a
P V or a P Q bus, the system may experience varying degrees
of impacts related to total loss, some loss, or no loss of
the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of certain grid-
supporting devices. More speciﬁcally, if the attacker is able
to attack a P V bus, we assume a worst-case scenario since
the attacker demonstrated to have enough information and
skills to attack a highly secure system and possibly have the
means to exploit additional vulnerabilities. This, in turn, may
result in a total loss of integrity, conﬁdentiality, and avail-
ability. Using this assumption, the impact of compromising
a P V will cause high impact on conﬁdentiality, integrity,
and availability. On the other hand, despite existing research
demonstrating the importance of load altering attacks on
power system stability [47], manipulation of P Q buses and
load change attacks will likely not result in interruption of
the operation of the generator, load, or transmission line in
the system due to frequency load shedding protections [48].
Under these circumstances, the impact of a compromised P Q
bus will not be signiﬁcant enough when compared to the
impact of a compromised P V bus [49]. Thus, we assume
that compromising P Q buses will have low impact in all
three categories. Finally, the no impact value is used when
an attacker compromises an electronic device that is not
connected to any P V or P Q bus.

Based on the exploitability and impact metrics, CVSS can

be calculated as shown in Eq. (3) [28]:

CV SS =

(cid:26) min {E + I, 10},

if S unchanged
min {1.08 · (E + I), 10}, if S changed

E = (AV · AC · U I · P R) · 8.22

where Ib = 1 − [(1 − C) · (1 − In) · (1 − A)]. E, AV ,
AC, U I, P R, S, and I represent the exploitability metric,
attack vector, attack complexity, user interaction, privileges
required, scope, and impact metrics, respectively. The calcu-
lated CVSS value is used as a major factor in the computation
of the T P within our transition model.

The traditional CVSS scoring method provides a detailed
calculation process that assesses the impact of exploiting
a vulnerability with different attack vectors. However, it
cannot be used directly for our application since it fails to
consider important factors when used to evaluate complex
cyberphysical systems. In particular for power systems, it
does not take into account features such as system topology,
power generation, and line constraints. Since we assume the
adversarial agent does not have full topological information,
we include power generation and line constraint calculations
in our proposed T P calculation. Since generators provide
varying amounts of power to a system depending on the
current state of the grid, the relative importance of a generator
(and hence its attack impact) is determined by its power
output. In addition to considering the difﬁculty of transition-
ing to certain system nodes, we also examine the overload
percentage of the transmission lines. If the power ﬂow across
that line is near its ﬂow constraint, the line could be more
easily affected by changes in the surrounding system. Taking
each of the aforementioned aspects into consideration, we
deﬁne the T P as follows in Eq. (6):

current state, a is the action at s, s(cid:48) is the new state, and a(cid:48)
includes all the future potential actions. Using the learning
rate α ∈ [0, 1], the new Q-value (Qnew(s, a)) is updated
using the current Q-value (Qold(s, a)), the estimated optimal
Q(s(cid:48), a(cid:48))), and the immediate reward (R).
future value (max
γ ∈ [0, 1] represents a discount factor that determines the
importance of immediate rewards compared with potential
long-term rewards. A higher Q-value demonstrates that a
series of actions will produce a higher total accumulated
reward. These actions are referred to as the optimal policy.

where G is the power generation of a connected generator,
n is the total number of generation units in the system, P f
represents the power ﬂow through transmission lines, and
λcritical is the line power ﬂow constraint for the connected
transmission line. For a power system operating under nor-
mal conditions, the range of G/{(cid:80)n
k=1 Gk} ∈ [0, 1] and
λcritical ∈ [0, 1]. Since the CV SS score ∈ [0, 10], we
scale it by dividing by 10. A smaller T P value represents
a cyberphysical node vulnerability of low severity, i.e., the
node has lower possibilities to be exploited by attackers since
it has a lower CVSS score, and it is less important in terms
of overload percentage, generation amount, and thermal lim-
its. On the contrary, a T P represents a cyberphysical node
vulnerability of high severity.

D. STEP 4: SOLUTION OF ADVERSARIAL MODEL
After formulating and deﬁning the corresponding POMDP,
in this step, we develop an algorithm to solve the model
and yield the optimal transition policy for the considered
threat. Due to the complexity of EPS, it is important to have
a mechanism to solve sequential decision-making problems
efﬁciently. In our studies, we develop a DQN-based DRL
algorithm.

1) Q-Learning
Q-learning is an off-policy RL algorithm designed to ﬁnd the
optimal action an agent needs to take at the current state. All
the actions that the RL agent can take are evaluated using
a Q-value which determines how good is a particular action
in the current state. Eq. (7) shows the ‘update’ rule used to
calculate new Q-values at each state-action pair, where s is

+ α · (R + γ · max

Q(s(cid:48), a(cid:48)) − Qold(s, a))

(7)

a

Traditionally, Q-learning is implemented using Q-tables.
However, this approach is not practical nor scalable for
solving large state-action environments. To solve this issue,
researchers in [50] proposed the replacement of Q-tables
with deep neural networks, also known as DQNs.

2) Deep Q-Network (DQN)
In order to address the computational overhead of Q-learning
when dealing with large, uncertain, and dynamic environ-
ments, DQNs generalize the approximation of the Q-value
function using artiﬁcial neural networks rather than storing
every solution in a table. For our environment modeled
as a POMDP, we assume that the DQN agent starts in a
random initial state s (a node in the cyberphysical network)
and transitions to the next state s(cid:48) occur by taking actions
(i.e., moving through nodes/buses in the system) based on
observations until it reaches both nodes of the contingency
pair, regardless of transition order. As shown in Eq. (8), an
observation function O generates the observations for each
potential action a(cid:48) given state s. The state s refers to the
bus where the agent is currently located during the solution
process including all bus-related corresponding information
and measurements (i.e., circuit breaker status, power gener-
ation, power consumption, voltages, etc.). At every step, the
agent makes an observation o which helps to indicate which
possible movements (or actions) the agent can take according
to the observed available neighboring buses and branches
connected to the current bus. Then, based on the observation,
an action a (movement to another bus) is performed in order
to transition to the next state (i.e., the next bus). Fig. 4

ACBGEDFHILNJKMCan be observedCurrent State𝑎2𝑎3𝑎1Liu et al.: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cybersecurity Assessment of Wind Integrated Power Systems

presents an overview of this process. It can be seen that if the
current state of the agent is bus A, then the attacker (agent)
can make an observation o to obtain the next available bus to
move into, which can be either K, I, or M, by taking a1, a2,
or a3, respectively. Using the observation, the agent is also
capable of revealing whether or not a contingency is present
in the current bus where it moved into, since the contingency
pairs are known to the attacker from the analysis in step 2
(Section III-B).

O(o|s, a) = O(o|s(cid:48), a(cid:48))

(8)

Once each potential transition is determined, the T P for
each transition needs to be computed (as deﬁned in Eq.
(6)). These calculated results will be utilized to determine
the security index, SI (cid:48)
i, when making a transition from s
to s(cid:48) as shown in Eq. (9), where γ is a discount factor, and
∆Cp is the line ﬂow difference between the current state and
each potential transition state. Finally, the maximum value of
the security index which represents the bus with the highest
vulnerabilities’ score and overload value, will be used to
compute the corresponding reward function. As shown in
Eq. (10), the reward function considers the overall beneﬁt of
different transitions as it takes into account the security index
of each potential state, SI (cid:48)
i.

State-action-rewards tuples are stored in the replay mem-
ory set M for recording agent’s experiences. This memory
set assists in independently training the neural network.
All environmental information of the current state (weights,
biases) is stored in the action-value parameter θ. In each
step, the DQN combines multi-layered neural networks with
existing Q-learning algorithms to approximate Q(s, a; θ). θ−
will change as the result of changing θ. Eq. (11) demonstrates
the updated target value given by the current state and action,
where the target action-value parameter θ− is equal to θ
at the beginning of the iterations. When this number of
iterations is reached during training, θ− is updated to prevent
an obstructed learning process [51]. Using the parameters
described, the loss-function value can be calculated as shown
in Eq. (12) for each state-action pair. It represents the error
between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value. The
goal is to determine an optimal policy that minimizes the
error and ensures that the training result will be as close as
possible to the target value, where the target value is the
estimated expected return of the actions taken by the DQN.

The agent performs an action that is selected according
to the designated exploration-exploitation ((cid:15)-greedy) strat-
egy of Eq. (13). Such a strategy controls the degree of
exploitation over exploration. At each step, if exploration is
being performed with probability (cid:15), the algorithm selects a
random action at from the action set. During exploitation
with probability 1 − (cid:15), the action with the maximum Q-value
is taken. The target values θ− will only be updated once
the desired number of iterations has been reached [51]. The
overall learning process is presented in Fig. 5 and the notation
of the DQN parameters is summarized in Table 4. This
learning process is repeated until a terminal state is reached,
i.e., both contingency pairs have been ﬁnally “visited” by the
agent.

E. STEP 5: OUTPUT OF THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS
An attacker with sufﬁcient OSINT can aggregate enough
power system information (e.g., power generation, capacity,
load consumption, topological data, etc.) to perform contin-
gency analysis and identify critical system elements. These
identiﬁed critical contingency elements can be leveraged to
generate cyberattack transition policies following the process
described in previous steps. The generated cyberattack tran-
sition policies take into account vulnerabilities in electronic
devices that exist in the cyber network layer as well as
physical system vulnerabilities related to contingency stud-
ies. The DRL algorithm provides a solution known as the
optimal attack transition policy that can be used to attack
the devices controlling the operations of the critical elements

ers, protocol translator converters, etc.) and results in poten-
tial power outages in the EPS. Our methodology can also
be leveraged by control center operators and stakeholders
to identify vulnerable components in the EPS or investigate
potential attack strategies.

IV. CONTINGENCY ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS
In this section, we introduce a number of contingency sim-
ulation case studies used to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. These case scenarios prove how
the most critical contingency pairs of a system vary when
wind energy systems are in-place. We provide an analysis
of the varying degrees of severity with different contingency
scenarios and examine how wind generation impacts critical
contingencies. For this validation study, we use a doubly-fed
induction generator (DFIG) model for wind power generation
modeling and real-time simulation (OPAL-RT) for testing the
system in a real-time environment.

A. CONTINGENCY SCENARIOS

First, we run the assessment process of Section III up to
Step 2 in order to assess multiple contingency scenarios in
different test systems. In Table 5, we present the number of
critical contingencies for N − 1, N − 1 − 1, and N − 2
scenarios in different power system test cases. For example,
the IEEE 39 bus system has 13 N − 1, 19 N − 1 − 1, and
71 critical N − 2 contingencies without any wind power
injection, while the number of these contingencies varies
with different wind penetration levels.

The N − 1 contingencies are determined by disconnecting
each line and observing system responses. For N − 1 − 1, the
most severe N − 1 case is removed from the system, and the
process is run again. The N − 2 pruning algorithm is carried
out as described in Section III. In the rest of the section, we
focus on the N − 2 case as the most severe scenario. It should
be noted that the proposed approach can be adapted, based on
user requirements, for any number of contingencies k.

DFIG MODEL
A DFIG model consists of a wound rotor induction generator
driven by wind turbines and an AC/DC/AC insulated-gate
bipolar transistor-based pulse width modulated converter.
The DFIG model used in our case studies for modeling wind
energy systems is developed in MATLAB/Simulink. Using
this model, we are able to study the dynamic response of
EPS to wind speed variations and investigate the impact of
different penetrations. Three DFIGs are modeled and inte-
grated to the IEEE 39 bus system at buses 5, 21, and 26
(Fig. 6) [52]. The wind speed and wind power data for each
wind system are collected at a one-minute resolution on May

power generation levels. The wind speed and corresponding
wind power generation information are provided in Fig.7(a)
and Fig.7(b). In scenario B, the wind speed and power data
are obtained from three locations in Boston, MA (Wind 1),
Dallas, TX (Wind 2), and Tifﬁn, OH (Wind 3) with different
weather characteristics. For this scenario, the wind speed
and power generation are shown in Fig.8(a) and Fig.8(b),
respectively.

C. CONTINGENCY SCENARIOS WITH WIND POWER
INJECTION
The amount of power produced by wind energy systems
ﬂuctuates due to wind’s intermittent nature. As the generation
changes, power ﬂow varies, which may affect contingency
analysis results. Therefore, we simulate wind power injection
levels at eight distinct timestamps, for the two simulation
scenarios (scenario A and scenario B) throughout one day
and observe the changes in reported contingencies with dif-
ferent wind penetration. These tests are performed for the
IEEE 39 bus system (Fig. 6). As shown in Table 6 and Table
7, seven wind power integration simulation cases (SC1-SC7)
are simulated for scenario A and scenario B. For each case,
we present the amount of power injected by the three DFIG-
based wind farms (WF1, WF2, WF3) and the number of
identiﬁed N − 2 contingencies.

For scenario A in Table 6, the highest number of N − 2
contingency pairs (100) exists when WF2 and WF3 are inte-
grated to the system (SC5) with generation of 159.20MW and
155.70MW, respectively. The least amount of pairs occurs

when WF1 and WF2 turbines are injecting power into the
system (SC4), and the wind power injection for WF1 and
WF2 are 77.52MW and 54.52MW, respectively. As shown in
the results, the number of N − 2 contingencies change when
the same amount of power is injected at different locations.
Additionally, injecting varying levels of power in the same
location also changes the number of contingencies.

As for scenario B in Table 7, the highest number of
N − 2 contingency pairs (103) exists when WF2 and WF3
are integrated into the system (SC5), and the wind power

injection for WF2 and WF3 are 136.80MW and 187.30MW,
respectively. The least amount of pairs occurs when only
WF1 is injecting 126.30MW power into the system (SC1).

Comparing with the normal case of IEEE 39 bus system
without wind power injections (71 pairs of N − 2 contin-
gencies in Table 5), the number of N − 2 contingencies in
38 cases (out of 56 cases in total in Table 6) of scenario
A are over 71. For scenario B, 44 cases (out of 56 cases in
total in Table 7) are more than 71. These results demonstrate
how the intermittent behavior of wind energy directly affects

12

the number and location of contingencies in EPS with high
penetration of RES. A more speciﬁc case that shows how
the intermittent behavior of wind can alter the number of
contingencies can be observed in Table 5. The number of
N −2 contingencies can increase or decrease when compared
with the case of no wind injection. One scenario that results
in a lower number of N − 2 contingencies is SC7 at t = 1400
where the number of N − 2 contingencies decreases from the
original 71 to 67; thus making the EPS more secure under
contingency conditions. A counterexample of this behavior
can be observed in SC7 at t = 0 where the number of N − 2
contingencies increases from 71 to 84.

D. REAL-TIME SIMULATION OF IEEE 39 BUS SYSTEM
We further examine the effect of contingency scenarios in a
real-time simulation environment. We observe the impact of
intermittent wind power injections across the IEEE 39 bus
system by analyzing the variability of all the bus voltages
in the system. At t = 0.3s, a N − 2 contingency event is
triggered by simultaneously disconnecting two three-phase
circuit breakers. To understand the severity of losing critical
elements, we disconnect the most critical pair (lines 5 − 8
and 6 − 7) from the N − 2 contingency set of the IEEE
39 bus system. Fig. 9(a) presents the N − 2 effect that
disconnecting lines 5 − 8 and 6 − 7 have in the test system
without any wind connected. Fig. 9(b) demonstrates the same
contingency scenario (disconnection of lines 5 − 8 and 6 − 7)
with wind power being injected to the system (Table 6: SC7
t = 800m). In this scenario, WF1, WF2, and WF3 inject
153.70MW, 159.20MW, and 155.70MW power to the test
case system, respectively. An additional test scenario is run
using the same contingency pairs (disconnection of lines 5−8
and 6 − 7) with different wind power injections (Table 7:
SC5 t = 0m). In this case, WF2 and WF3 inject 136.80MW
and 187.30MW, respectively, with the results depicted in
Fig.9(c).

In order to understand the effect that different N − 2
contingency pairs may have in the EPS, we perform studies
using different N − 2 pairs present in the contingency set.
For these studies, we disconnect a less critical contingency
pair from the N − 2 contingency set. At t = 0.3s, circuit
breakers are tripped at lines 10 − 13 and 16 − 21, in a test
case system without any wind power penetration, and the re-
spective voltage variations can be observed in Fig. 9(d). Fig.
9(e) depicts how the voltage variations change when wind
penetration (Table 6: SC7 t = 800m) is considered under
the same contingency scenario. An additional case (Table 7:
SC5 t = 0m) with the contingency pair 10 − 13, 16 − 21 is
demonstrated in Fig. 9(f).

When comparing the real-time simulation results, we can
observe that the most critical contingency pair (lines 5 − 8
and 6 − 7) causes higher voltage variations when compared
to a less critical contingency pair (lines 10 − 13 and 16 − 21).
Several buses in the EPS reach under and over-voltage values
of around 0.87 p.u. and 1.1 p.u. for the most critical contin-
gency pair (lines 5 − 8 and 6 − 7) and under and over-voltage

values of around 0.92 p.u. and 1.18 p.u. for the less critical
contingency pair (lines 10 − 13 and 16 − 21). Also, besides
observing the voltage variations different contingency pairs
can produce, we can also observe, in some cases, how the
intermittent behavior of wind power helps to mitigate the
severity of line overloads. Figs. 9(d) – 9(f) demonstrate this
behavior. For instance, in Fig. 9(e), most buses of the power
system have voltage measurements that are closer to the
nominal 1.0 p.u value. On the other hand, the case in Fig.
9(f) shows the opposite, since some voltage values measured
at some buses are farther apart from 1.0 p.u when compared
with the case where no wind power injection is included,
i.e., Fig. 9(d). Our results demonstrate how important is to
coordinate the amount of wind power as it penetrates the
system. For example, the authors in [24] proposed a scheme
for power systems to maintain N −1 security within different
levels of wind power injection. In addition, a dynamic reserve
allocation of DFIG wind farms is presented in [54] to sustain
system frequency stability. In our case, the results not only
demonstrate the variation of N − 2 contingency numbers but
also how these results can be used to control the penetration
level of wind farms to increase the N − 2 secure operational
range of power systems.

V. RESULTS: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED
CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENT
This section presents our experimental results that demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed cybersecurity as-
sessment approach. We evaluate the efﬁcacy of the process
according to the optimal attack transition policies given as
outputs. In this part, we provide the experimental setup for
the presented test cases, the DQN agent model implemen-
tation details, and its corresponding hyperparameters. Six
test case systems are used to demonstrate the number of
transitions needed to identify the optimal attack path for
the corresponding case. Furthermore, the performance of the
DQN model is evaluated according to the obtained rewards
and losses, i.e., convergence for each test case. Finally, the
effectiveness of the DQN, used to solve the transition model,
is veriﬁed by comparing it to other transition-path policy-
ﬁnding methods, and speciﬁcally to the: (i) random policy
search, (ii) depth-ﬁrst search (DFS), (iii) Dijkstra’s shortest
path algorithm, and an (iv) IVSS-based DQN model.

chine with an Intel Core i7-7600U, 2.8GHz, and 16.00GB of

guage. The DQN solver for POMDP is provided in [55].

B. CYBERSECURITY ASSESSMENT: ATTACK-PATH
TRANSITION RESULTS
In order to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed cyberse-
curity assessment process, we use six test case power systems
related with the contingency studies in Section IV (Table 5):
(a) IEEE 30 bus system, (b) IEEE 39 bus system, (c) IEEE
39 bus system with wind W1 (Table 6 SC7 at t = 800m), (d)
IEEE 39 bus system with wind W2 (Table 7 SC5 at t = 0m),
(e) UIUC 150 bus system, and the (f) Polish 2383 bus system.
Based on the identiﬁed critical N − 2 pairs, the malicious
agent begins at a random initial state and ﬁnds the optimal
attack-path transition policy to the existing and most critical
N − 2 contingencies. A contingency is identiﬁed when one
of the two buses has been visited by the agent. In Table 9,
we show the number of transitions required to reach both
critical contingencies as well as the number of P V and P Q
buses visited by the agent. For each comparison, ﬁve random
initial states are selected for each test system, and the average
results are presented. For example, the IEEE 39 bus system
requires an average of 8.8 transitions to correctly identify
the most critical contingency pair. During the transitions, an
average number of 0.4 generation (P V ) and 4.6 load (P Q)
buses need to be visited, i.e., compromised, by the agent. TT r
is the training and evaluation time (in seconds) needed for the
DQN to ‘learn’ the optimal attack path for different cases,
and TT o is the total time (in seconds) required to complete the
process. The utilization of the Polish 2383 bus system in our
experimental results aids in the evaluation of our proposed
process with a realistic large-scale EPS. As seen in Table 9,

Figure 10: DQN rewards for bus test systems.

Figure 11: Average DQN loss for bus test systems.

the training and evaluation process of the DQN in a typical
computer with 2.8GHz CPU and 16.00GB RAM requires an
average of 1459.5 seconds (approximately 24 minutes), and a
total running time of 1506.7 seconds (approximately 25 min-
utes). Note that the running time of the entire process could
be reduced by decreasing the number of hidden neurons in
the DQN model. The results demonstrate that the proposed
cybersecurity process can be used in tandem with medium
and long-term control and planning applications. On the other
hand, the proposed approach would require high computing
power in order to be integrated into very short-term decision
making processes [57].

C. DQN REWARDS AND LOSS CONVERGENCE
As mentioned in Section III, the DQN aims to minimize
the loss between the target value and the predicted value.
The DQN agent learns the optimal policy as this loss is
minimized. Here, we verify and evaluate the performance of
our proposed approach by examining the convergence of the
DQN loss during the training process. We also show how
the average reward gradually increases at each step, for each
test case, up to 250 training steps. It should be noted that the

total number of training steps used is 500 while the update
frequency of the plot is set to 2, thus only 250 steps can be
observed in the graph. Fig. 10 shows the rewards for each
test case system and Fig. 11 shows the corresponding loss for
each case. As shown in Fig. 10, the DQN agent progressively
‘learns’ how to maximize the cumulative rewards in each
test case system. At the same time, as the agent ‘learns’, the
loss keeps decreasing until it converges to a minimum value
as depicted in Fig. 11. These results showcase the training
process of the DQN agent and its performance on all bus test
case systems.

D. EFFECTIVENESS OF DQN: COMPARISON WITH
OTHER TRANSITION TECHNIQUES
The effectiveness of using a DQN model in our cybersecurity
assessment process is demonstrated by comparing our DQN
agent based on the CVSS scoring system with different
techniques that could be used to ﬁnd the optimal attack
transition policy in a graph. The techniques used to compare
the performance of the proposed DQN are: (i) random policy
search, (ii) DFS, (iii) Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, and
(iv) IVSS-based DQN model. The random transition tech-
nique provides a baseline, or naive case, where transitions
are performed randomly, i.e., without any intelligent control
mechanisms. DFS is a searching technique for traversing a
tree structure by starting from an arbitrary root node and
exploring each branch as far as possible before going back

to the root node and continuing to the next branch. Dijkstra’s
algorithm is a more sophisticated way of ﬁnding an optimal
path through a graph structure. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used
to solve shortest-path problems in non-negative weighted
graphs by ﬁnding an acyclic path between a source and a
target node with the minimum transition cost. Both DFS
and Dijkstra’s search policies need full observability of the
network, hence, for testing purposes in those two cases, we
assume full observability of the system and its corresponding
contingency pair. Finally, the IVSS-based DQN model is
designed to evaluate the differences between the CVSS and
IVSS vulnerability assessment criteria.

The tests conducted are run using the power system test
cases presented in Table 9. For each case, ﬁve random initial
states are selected and the average number of transitions is
calculated. The maximum, minimum, and average number of
transitions for each case are shown in the box plots presented
in Fig.12. From Figs. 12(a) – 12(f), we can observe that, in
general, the results of the DQNs-based transition techniques
tend to require fewer number of transitions, i.e., are more
efﬁcient, when compared with the random and the DFS tran-
sition techniques. When compared with Dijkstra’s algorithm,
our DQN implementation performs slightly worse due to
its iterative learning process. However, Dijkstra’s shortest
path algorithm has the major disadvantage of requiring full
system observability. The results demonstrate the advantages
of using DQN as the main solver technique for our proposed

process. Finally, it can also be observed from Fig. 12 that
using CVSS v.3.1 has major advantages when compared to
the IVSS scoring system. The CVSS-based DQN consis-
tently requires fewer number of transitions in all evaluated
test cases.

To understand the scalability of the proposed DQN ap-
proach based on CVSS and IVSS, the number of transitions
for the different test systems evaluated are plotted in the
box plots shown in Figs. 13(a) and 13(b). In these ﬁgures,
we can observe that as the number of buses increase, the
number of transitions also increases but not in an exponen-
tial fashion. Additionally, the results depicted in the ﬁgures
demonstrate that in almost all test systems the DQN based
on CVSS requires a smaller number of transitions than the
DQN approach based on IVSS. An example of the improved
performance when using the CVSS-based approach can be
observed when comparing the number of transitions required
for the Polish 2383 test system.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we present a cybersecurity assessment approach
designed to assess the cyberphysical security of EPS with
high penetration of wind. The proposed process assumes that
adversaries could leverage OSINT to perform contingency
analysis. Based on the contingency results and identiﬁed ex-
ploitable cyberphysical vulnerabilities via an adapted CVSS
metric, an optimal attack transition policy is generated that
can be potentially leveraged to cause major outages in an
EPS. The results provided by the proposed process are also
critical for improving cybersecurity visibility for system op-
erators and stakeholders; it provides information regarding
the most critical attack-path an adversary must follow to
severely compromise the system alongside with information
about the most vulnerable elements in the EPS at a partic-
ular time. The proposed approach is tested using real-time
simulation, realistic data from various actual wind energy
systems, and various test case power systems. Additionally,
results regarding the training and convergence of the DQN

agent, proposed as the main optimal attack-path transition
technique, are presented and compared with other competing
techniques. These results demonstrate the applicability of the
cybersecurity assessment approach in modern EPS.

The limitations of the cybersecurity assessment approach
presented in this work include mostly the assumptions related
to the threat model: (i) The contingency analysis can only be
performed when the attacker has sufﬁcient power system data
acquired using OSINT techniques. Without the necessary
information, the set of contingencies cannot be correctly
identiﬁed. (ii) The cyber system network graph is assumed
to be isomorphic with the physical system graph, indicating
that the topology of the communication network is mapped
one-to-one with the topology of the physical system. This
assumption may not be necessarily true on some systems,
since the physical and communication networks could have
different network topologies.

Based on the limitations discussed, future work will focus
on: (i) Exploring potential defense strategies based on mov-
ing target defense methods that could be used to enhance
the overall system security and resilience by dynamically
updating time-varying parameters within the control system
of EPS (act as a moving target), thus, limiting adversaries
understanding of the cyberphysical EPS model. (ii) Analyz-
ing and investigating other DRL solvers that can be adapted
into the proposed cybersecurity assessment approach (e.g.,
UCB, A3C, or TRPO). (iii) Investigating how transitions, in
the proposed cybersecurity assessment approach, are affected
in scenarios where the cyber and physical networks are
not assumed isomorphic; examined by using real-time co-
simulation testbeds.
