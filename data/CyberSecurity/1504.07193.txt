Abstract—This  work  presents  an  application  of  the  highly 
expressive  Attribute-Based  Encryption  to  implement  Secure 
Zones  for  firearms.  Within  these  zones,  radio-transmitted  local 
policies  based  on  attributes  of  the  user  and  the  firearm  are 
received  by  embedded  hardware  in  the  firearms,  which  then 
advises  the  user  about  safe  operations.  The  Secure  Zones  utilize 
Attribute-Based  Encryption  to  encode  the  policies  and  user 
attributes,  and  providing  privacy  and  security  through  it 
cryptography.  We  describe  a  holistic  approach  to  evolving  the 
firearm to a cyber-physical system to aid in augmenting safety. We 
introduce a conceptual model for a firearm equipped with sensors 
and  a  context-aware  software  agent.  Based  on  the  information 
from the sensors, the agent can access the context and inform the 
user of potential unsafe operations. To support Secure Zones and 
firearm  model,  we  propose  a  Key 
the  cyber-physical 
Infrastructure  Scheme  for  key  generation,  distribution,  and 
management,  and  a  Context-Aware  Software  Agent  Framework 
for Firearms.

INTRODUCTION 

Advances  of  digital  technologies,  as  they  are  incorporated 
into  devices  for  people’s  usage,  often  result  in  enhancements 
including  ease  of  use,  safety,  precision,  optimizations  in 
resource  consumption  and  costs.  The  trend  has  produced 
machines  heavily  dependent  on  cyber  systems;  onto  these 
machines we rely and happily entrust our lives. Commercial and 
military  aircraft  and  their  complex  avionics  and  automatic 
landing procedures; automobiles and their anti-lock brakes and 
collision  avoidance  systems;  health  patients  surrending  their 
well-being  to  pacemakers,  electronic  monitors,  and  robotic 
surgeons. 

One  device  has  persisted  largely  untouched  by  cyber 
technology since its inception possibly in the 12th century: the 
firearm.  In  light  of  recent  tragic  mass  shootings,  communities 
again claim for employing technology to boost firearm safety. In 
this paper, we propose evolving this mechanical device into a 
cyber-physical  system  for  greater  safety.  In  particular,  we 
Cyphertext-Policy  Attribute-Based 
envision 
Encryption (CP-ABE, [1], [2]) to establish zones within which, 
according  to  choice,  a  firearm  can  alert  the  user  of  unsafe 

applying 

operation,  depending  on  attributes  programmed  in  the  gun’s 
electronics. 

II.  THE FIREARM AS CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM 

With current technology, a firearm could comprise a set of 
sensors enabling it to gather a wide range of information from 
the  environment,  as  well  as  feedback  outputs  to  the  user.  A 
software  agent  inside  the  firearm  can  integrate  the  contextual 
information to form an evaluation of the immediate situation; the 
firearm  becomes  context-aware.  Upon  this  evaluation,  the 
firearm  can  advise  the  user  of  potential  unsafe  operations 
through visual or haptic feedback. These sensors and feedback 
components  are  such  as  microphone,  front-  and  rear-facing 
cameras,  accelerometers,  haptic  and  visual  feedback,  tamper-
proof device containing the cryptography and context software 
agent, and radio antennas. 

III.  THE SECURE ZONE 

We visualize a simple, safe schema for realizing safety areas 
for firearm operations within the firearm itself, with the aid of 
digital  technologies.  In  this  schema,  a  Secure  Zone  comprises 
one  or  more  radio  transmitters  that  will  transmit  a  digital 
message  containing  the  zone’s  operation  policy  for  firearms. 
The message consists of an encrypted digital signature together 
with the codification of a firearm operation policy for the zone, 
using  CP-ABE.  Each  Secure  Zone  will  have  its  own  wireless 
transmission  with  its  own  encrypted  message  representing the 
firearm operation policy within that zone. 

Individual firearms receive, at the time of purchase or during 
a  registration  process,  a  private  key  that  encodes  attributes  of 
that firearm and those of the authorized user. Within a Secure 
Zone  range,  a  firearm  receives  the  zone  wireless  broadcast 
transmission  through  its  radio  interface;  embedded  software 
agent  attempts  to  decode  the  encrypted  message  using  the 
firearm’s private key. If successful, it means that firearm is able 
to safely operate within that zone; otherwise, the operation is not 
safe,  and  the  firearm’s  feedback  components  will  actuate  to 
inform the user of such. 

Our  approach  uses  one-way  communication,  avoiding 
energy-costly two-way communication necessary if the firearm 
had  to  communicate  with  the  Secure  Zone  radio  to  negotiate 
operations or uniquely identify a gun/user. 

 
 
 
IV.  KEY INFRASTRUCTURE SCHEME 

This  infrastructure  uses  CP-ABE  and  builds  upon  systems 

proposed by [3], [4], [5]. 

A.  System Model 

Central  Authority  (CA):  The  CA  is  managed  by  the 
government (the same branch that regulates firearms), and it is 
trusted.  The  CA’s  responsibility  is  to  issue  keys  to  firearms, 
manage  the  attribute  set 
,  and  register  Secure  Zone 
Authorities, sending them cryptography parameters. 

𝒜𝒜

Secure Zone Authority (SZA): The SZA is responsible for 
encrypting and wirelessly transmitting Secure Zone messages to 
the users/firearms. An SZA is managed by a zone administrator 
or  owner.  SZA’s  must  register  with  the  CA  to  receive  proper 
cryptography parameters. 

Firearms  (F):  A  firearm  receives  its  ABE  secret  key  and 
other  security  parameters  upon  registration  with  the  proper 
government  branch.  This  secret  key  expresses  the  attributes 
established by the government, according to specific rules that 
consider the firearm and the user/owner. 

B.  Scheme Construction and Operation 

System Setup: Central Authority generates its ABE system 
public/master secret key. Generates its own public/private key. 
Securely stores each SZA’s public key and securely sends this 
SZA public key back to the SZA, encrypted with the CA private

V.  PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTATION AND FUTURE WORK 

Our initial experimentation focuses on implementing the key 
infrastructure and performing simulations, in which we evaluate 
and demonstrate whether mobile users within secure zones range 
can properly receive and decrypt the messages, if they have the 
appropriate  attributes.  Our  future  work  involves  investigating 
the effectiveness of the proposed security model, and how to best 
address the issues of key revocation and update, as well as its 
performance in light of several attack vectors. Moreover, we will 
augment our model with delegating key generation to the Secure 
Zone Authorities.
