Abstract  —  The  paper  presents  StegBlocks,  which 
defines  a  new  concept  for  performing  undetectable 
hidden  communication.  StegBlocks 
is  a  general 
for  constructing  methods  of  network 
approach 
steganography.  In  StegBlocks,  one  has  to  determine 
objects  with  defined  properties  which  will  be  used  to 
transfer hidden messages. The objects are dependent on 
a  specific  network  protocol  (or  application)  used  as  a 
carrier  for  a  given  network  steganography  method. 
Moreover,  the  paper  presents  the  approach  to  perfect 
undetectability  of  network  steganography,  which  was 
developed  based  on  the  rules  of  undetectability  for 
general steganography. The approach to undetectability 
of  network  steganography  was  used  to  show  the 
possibility of developing perfectly undetectable network 
steganography methods using the StegBlocks concept.

 INTRODUCTION 

Network  steganography  incorporates  all  information 
hiding  techniques  that  may  be  used to  exchange  secret data 
in  telecommunication  networks.  This  term  was  originally 
introduced  by  Szczypiorski 
in  2003  [1].  In  network 
steganography,  hidden  communication  is  facilitated  by 
methods  which  utilise  network  protocols  or  relationships 
between them as a carrier [2]. It is important to note that an 
observer (a third party) who is not aware that they are using 
the steganographic method is also not aware of the exchange 
of hidden data. 
Network 

be 
characterised  by  four  features:  bandwidth,  undetectability, 
robustness,  and  cost.  The  first  three  features,  introduced  by 
Fridrich  in  1998  [3],  are  often  presented  as  vertices  of  a 
triangle  in  order  to  show  the  interdependence  among  them. 
For example, the higher the required bandwidth is, the more 
difficult it is to achieve high undetectability and robustness. 
This interdependence causes the need for a trade-off between 
the  three  features  when  a  new  steganographic  system  is 
designed.

The  last  feature  mentioned  –  cost  –  indicates  the 
degradation  of  the  carrier  caused  by  the  insertion  of  the 
secret data procedure [4]. It is important to note that the cost 
depends on each particular carrier and could be expressed in 

many  ways,  e.g.  in-creased  delay  of  packets,  increased  bit 
error rate, etc. 

It  should  be  emphasised 

the  most  desirable 
characteristic  of  network  steganography  communication  is 
usually undetectability [5]. 

that 

There are many known network steganography methods. 
However,  most  of  them  can  be  easily  detected  if  the 
algorithm  of  the  method  is  known  to  the  third  party  ob-
server.  Despite  this  fact,  many  authors  of  steganographic 
methods  claim  that  the  large  number  of  possible  ways  of 
inserting  hidden  data  into  network  communication  makes 
detection of their methods extremely hard. The main focus of 
the  analysis  of  undetectability  of  network  steganographic 
methods is to show that the steganographic cost is very low. 
There  are  very 
the  analysis  of 
few  examples  of 
undetectability  based  on  information  theory  or  computation 
power, making it very difficult to assess the negative impact 
network steganography may have on our lives. 

To  address  the  above-mentioned  problem,  in  this  paper 
we propose the StegBlocks concept, which  was designed to 
enable undetectable network steganography communication. 
StegBlocks  is  not  a  method  based  on  a  single  network 
protocol.  It  defines  an  algorithm  of  secret  communication 
and  requirements  for  a  network  protocol  (carrier)  which 
could be used to create the steganographic method. 

StegBlocks is used in this paper to show the possibility of 
constructing  a  network  steganography  method 
is 
perfectly  undetectable.  The  perfect  undetectability  is  based 
on  the  information-theoretic  approach,  which  has  been 
described  for  general  steganography  in  several  publications 
[6-8]. We adjusted this approach to cover specific features of 
network steganography.

In  this  article  we  focused  on  perfect  undetectability, 
which  is  parallel  to  the  perfect  security  of  cryptographic 
ciphers. 

The rest of  the paper  is  structured  as  follows.  Section 2 
introduces the concept of StegBlocks together with examples 
of  methods  built  based  on  it.  Section  3  describes  the 
the  perfect  undetectability  of  network 
approach 
steganography  communication.  Section 4 presents the proof 
of the possibility of creating a perfectly undetectable method 
based on StegBlocks. Finally, Section 5 concludes our work.

II.  STEGBLOCKS 

A.  An idea 

StegBlocks works using carriers (network protocols), for 
which elements (called objects) with various identifiers can 
be defined and the number of possible identifiers is limited. 
Once  the  objects  are  defined,  the  steganographic  method 
created using StegBlocks works in the following way: 
1.  Among  (cid:1866)  defined  objects  (objects  with  (cid:1866)  different 
identifiers),  choose (cid:1863) to  be  used  as  the  steganographic 
key.  The  identifiers  of  the  chosen  objects  have  to  be 
known to both the sender and the receiver of the hidden 
data. 

2.  Objects  are  merged  into  sequences  (called  blocks).  A 
block  is  defined  as  a  minimal-length  subsequence  in 
which there is at least one of each (cid:1863) steganographic key 
object. The beginning of a block has to be defined, e.g. 
the  end  of  one  block  determines  the  beginning  of  the 
next block. 

3.  Each  block  has  an  assigned  value,  which  is  the  last (cid:1876) 
bits of the number of objects in this block. The number 
of  objects  in  the  block  includes  all  objects,  not  only 
objects which belong to the steganographic key. 

4.  The  values  of  the  blocks  indicate  bits  of  the  hidden 
message.  If  the  value  of  the  block  which  is  to  be 
transmitted  is  not  equal  to  the  bits  of  the  hidden 
message, then the sender has to change the value of the 
block. 

the  steganographic  key  starting  from 

The example of StegBlocks for four objects {1, 2, 3, 4}, 
from  which  1  and  3  constitute  steganographic  keys,  is 
presented  in  Fig.  1.  The  sender  sends  objects  which  form 
blocks  based  on  the  steganographic  key.  The  first  block 
consists of three objects {1, 4, 3}, because it is the minimal-
length  sequence  of  an  object,  which  contains  all  of  the 
the 
objects  of 
beginning  of  the  transmission.  The  subsequent  blocks  are 
determined 
the 
communication presented in  Fig. 1 it  was assumed that the 
last  1  bit  of  the  number  of  objects  in  a  block  specifies  the 
value  of  the  block.  This  means  that  the  value  of  the  first 
block is 1 (the block consists of 3 (112) objects), the value of 
the  second  block  is  0  (the  block  consists  of  6  (1102) 
objects), etc. The values of the blocks indicate the value of 
the hidden message, so in the presented example the hidden 
bits  1010  are  transmitted.  The  receiver  has  to  know  the 
steganographic key in order to extract the secret message. 

the  same  way.  Additionally,

in 

Fig. 1 Example of StegBlocks 

The key element of StegBlocks is changing the values of 
the blocks in order to match them with the bits of the hidden 
message. This change can be made in three ways: 
• 
• 
• 

control of the current object, 
control of the buffer, 
control of the entire communication. 

Control  of  the  current  object  is  the  approach  in  which, 
before  sending  the  next  objects,  it  is  checked  whether  an 
object will complete the block. If the next object completes 
the block with a value which does not match the bits of the 
secret  message,  the  sender  suspends  the  sending  of  this 
object.  Then  the  sender  waits  for  next  objects  and  the 
suspended object is sent when it is possible to complete the 
block  with  the  required  value.  It  could  happen  that  the 
sender will have to suspend more than one object. 

Control of the buffer is the approach in which all objects 
are placed in a buffer of size s (s is the number of objects, 
(cid:1871) (cid:3410) 2) before sending. In comparison with the control of the 
current  object,  in  this  case  the  sender  knows  s  subsequent 
objects which are to be sent, allowing for more possibilities 
of changing the order of the objects. 

Control  of  the  entire  communication  is  the  approach  in 
which the sender has access to all objects before the start of 
the  communication.  This  approach  allows  for  both  the 
orders of any objects and the objects that are to be sent to be 
changed.  In  particular,  it  is  possible  to  generate  many 
possible sequences of objects to be sent in an overt channel 
and  choose  one,  whose  objects  form  blocks  with  values 
equal to bits of the secret message. 

B.  Examples of network steganography methods created 

based on StegBlocks 
This  section  presents 

two  examples  of  network 
steganography  methods  based  on  StegBlocks.  One  of  the 
methods uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and the 
other  method  uses  SCTP  (Stream  Control  Transmission 
Protocol). 

1)  StegBlocks TCP 

The  StegBlocks  TCP  method  uses  parallel  TCP 
connections  between  two  chosen  hosts.  The  objects  of  this 
method  are  TCP  segments  transmitted  within  the  parallel 
connection, and the identifiers of objects are the identifiers 
of the connection. The identifiers of connection (1, 2, ...) are 
assigned  starting  from  the  connection  that  was  established 
first.  A  connection  that  was  established  earlier  has  a  lower 
identifier than a connection established later. TCP segments 
within  a  given  connection  are  objects  with  the  same 
identifier. StegBlocks TCP works in the following way: 
1.  Two hosts, which are the sender and the receiver of the 
hidden  data,  have  (cid:1866)  TCP  connections  established 
between 
them.  Segments  sent  within  a  chosen 
connection  are  StegBlocks  TCP  objects  with  the  same 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
identifier. The number of unique identifiers of objects is 
equal to the number of used TCP connections. 

2.  Before  the  start  of  steganographic  communication,  the 
steganographic key is chosen ((cid:1863) objects (TCP segments) 
with  unique  identifiers  (TCP  connections  identifiers), 
which will determine the blocks). 

3.  A block is defined as the minimal-length sequence of an 
object, which contains at least one segment from each of 
the (cid:1863)  chosen  in  the  previous  point  TCP  connections. 
There are two ways of determining the start and end of 
the  block.  In  the  first  one,  the  start  of  the  block  is 
determined  by  the  end  of  the  previous  block.  In  the 
second  one,  the  start  of  the  block  is  determined  by 
sending a specified number of segments from the start of 
the  previous  block.  In  both  cases  it  could  be  assumed 
that  the  start  of  the  first  block  is  the  start  of  the 
transmission. 

4.  The value of each block is the last (cid:1876) bits of the number 
of TCP segments in this block. The number of segments 
in a block refers to all the segments in a block and not 
only  segments  within  the  chosen (cid:1863) connections  which 
determine the blocks. 

5.  The  value  of  a  chosen  block  determines  the  bits  of  the 
hidden  message. If  the  value of  a block is  not  equal to 
the  bits  of  the  hidden  message,  the  sender  has  to 
appropriately modify the value of the block by changing 
the order of the segments, which are sent within parallel 
TCP connections. 

The  main  problem  with  the  presented  method  is  the 
robustness  of  steganographic  data  transmission.  Extracting 
the hidden message depends on the order of the reception of 
TCP  segments.  If  one  of  the  segments  is  significantly 
delayed  or  lost,  it  could  influence  the  correctness  of  a 
received  secret  message.  In  order  to  avoid  this  issue,  the 
sender  has  to  wait  to  send  the  next  segment  of  a  message 
until  they  have  received  an  acknowledgement  of  the 
reception  of  the  previous  segment.  However,  this  solution 
may negatively affect the delays of an overt communication. 

2)  StegBlocks SCTP 

The  StegBlocks  SCTP  method  works  similarly  to 
StegBlocks TCP, but in this case the problem of robustness 
is eliminated. 

The  StegBlocks  SCTP  method  uses  one  SCTP 
connection  with  multiple  streams.  The  objects  of  this 
method are chunks  with data (DATA chunks) of the SCTP 
proto-col sent within established streams. The identifiers of 
objects  are  identifiers  of  the  streams.  Other  aspects  of  the 
StegBlocks SCTP method are analogous to the Steg-Blocks 
TCP method. 

The main advantage of the StegBlocks SCTP compared 
with  StegBlocks  TCP  is  the  possibility  of  ensuring  the 
robustness  of  the  steganographic  data  transmission.  In  the 
case  of  StegBlocks  SCTP,  the  receiver  can  determine  the 

order of objects based on the TSN (Transmission Sequence 
Number) field, and not based on the time of the reception of 
specific  objects  (as  in  the  case  of  StegBlocks  TCP).  The 
TSN is the sequence number  for the DATA chunks,  which 
is incremented and assigned to each chunk independently of 
the stream  within which the chunk was sent. In the case of 
the delay or loss of a chunk, it can be retransmitted with the 
same  TSN,  which  allows  the  correct  reception  of  a  secret 
message  to  be  independent  of  the  reception  time  of  each 
object of the StegBlocks SCTP method. 

III.  PERFECT UNDETECTABILITY OF NETWORK 
STEGANOGRAPHY 

Perfect  undetectability  means  that  an  adversary  with 
unlimited  computational  power  is  not  able  to  state  if  in  a 
given  overt  communication  there  is  also  a  hidden  message 
transmitted.  There  are  three  popular  definitions  of  perfect 
undetectability  (based  on  information  theory),  which  were 
introduced  mainly  for  general  steganography.  All  three 
definitions  are  derived  from  Shannon’s  definitions  of  the 
perfect security of a cryptographic system. 

In 1998 Zöllner et al. presented a definition [6] in which 
steganography  is  undetectable  if  a  hidden  message  is 
independent from a carrier and a steganogram (a carrier with 
a  hidden  message).  The  authors 
that  a 
steganographic system is undetectable if the adversary is not 
able  to  compare  a  carrier  and  a  steganogram.  In  order  to 
achieve it, the adversary cannot know what a carrier without 
a hidden message looks like. 

showed 

Cachin  also  proposed  a  definition  of  undetectable 
steganography in 1998 based on relative entropy (Kullback–
Leibler  divergence)  [7].  According  to  this  approach  the 
steganographic system is undetectable if the relative entropy 
of  the  distribution  of  carriers  without  hidden  data  and  the 
distribution of carriers with hidden data is equal to 0. 

In  1999  Mittelholzer  proposed  a  common  definition  of 
the security of steganography and watermarks [8]. According 
to this definition, a steganographic system is undetectable if 
it  is  not  possible  to  distinguish  a  carrier  and  a  carrier  with 
hidden  data.  In  order  to  measure  this,  the  author  suggested 
using  an  appropriate  distortion  measure,  e.g.  squared  error 
distortion. 

Among  the  presented  known  definitions  of  perfect 
undetectability  of  steganography,  the  most  comprehensive 
one  is  the  definition  suggested  by  Cachin  (Def.  1)  [7].  The 
definitions proposed by Zöllner et al. [6] and Mittelholzer [8] 
contain  necessary  conditions,  but  are  not  sufficient  for 
undetectable steganography [7]. 

Def.  1.  (Perfect  undetectability  of  a  steganographic  method 
according  to  [7])  A  steganographic  method  is  perfectly 
undetectable if: 

(cid:1830)(cid:4666)(cid:1842)(cid:1829)||(cid:1842)(cid:1845)(cid:4667) = ∑ (cid:1842)(cid:1829)(cid:4666)(cid:1861)(cid:4667) log

(cid:1861)

(cid:1842)(cid:1829)(cid:4666)(cid:1861)(cid:4667)
(cid:1842)(cid:1845) (cid:4666)(cid:1861)(cid:4667)

= 0, 

(1) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where: 
(cid:1842)(cid:3004) is the distribution of carriers without hidden data; 
(cid:1842)(cid:3020) is the distribution of carriers with hidden data; 
(cid:1830)(cid:4666)(cid:1842)(cid:3004)||(cid:1842)(cid:3020)(cid:4667) is  the  relative  entropy  of  the  distributions (cid:1842)(cid:3004) and 
(cid:1842)(cid:3020). 

Additionally, the author in [7] suggests assuming that the 
adversary knows the hidden message that could be sent using 
steganography.  Consequently,  an insertion algorithm  cannot 
depend on the distribution of the hidden message. 

The presented definition is appropriate for steganography 
in the content, e.g. images. However in the case of network 
steganography it is suggested that three elements of network 
steganography communication be included in this definition: 
• 
• 

data units (e.g. packets, segments); 
transmission  (time  between  sending/receiving  data 
units); 
hidden message. 

• 

The  mentioned  elements  were  incorporated  in  the 
the  perfect  undetectability  of  network 

definition  of 
steganography (Def. 2), which is based on Def. 1. 

Def.  2.  (Perfect  undetectability  of  a  network  steganography 
method)  A  network  steganography  method  is  perfectly 
undetectable if all the following conditions are satisfied: 
1.  The conditional entropy of the steganogram and hidden 
message  is  equal  to  the  entropy  of  the  steganogram 
(cid:3435)(cid:1834)(cid:4666)(cid:1845)|(cid:1839)(cid:4667) = (cid:1834)(cid:4666)(cid:1845)(cid:4667)(cid:3439). 

2.  The relative entropy of the distribution of data units of a 
carrier without hidden data ((cid:1842)(cid:3004)) and the distribution of a 
carrier with hidden data (PS) is equal to 0 (cid:4666)(cid:1830)(cid:4666)(cid:1842)(cid:3004)||(cid:1842)(cid:3020)(cid:4667) =
0(cid:4667).

IV.  PERFECT UNDETECTABILITY OF STEGBLOCKS 

StegBlocks helps in the creation of perfectly undetectable 
network  steganography  methods. In  order  to  achieve this, it 
is  necessary  to  impose  additional  requirements  for  the 
method based on StegBlocks. The key requirement is use of 
the  Vernam  cipher  to  encrypt  a  hidden  message  before 
inserting it into a carrier. 

Theorem  1.  StegBlocks  with  the  encryption  of  a  hidden 
message  using  the  Vernam  cipher  and  the  control  of  the 
entire  communication  allows  for  the  creation  of  a  network 

steganography  method 
according to Def. 2. 

Proof of Theorem 1 

that 

is  perfectly  undetectable 

The  proof  uses  a  network  steganography  method  based 

on StegBlocks with the following assumptions: 
•  (cid:1866)  unique  identifiers  of  objects  belonging  to  the  set 

(cid:4668)1,2,3, … (cid:1866)(cid:4669) are used; 

•  Objects are sent in groups and each group has n objects 

with all possible values of identifiers; 

•  Groups of objects are independent and the probability of 
the  occurrence  of  each  group  of  objects  is  the  same 
(1/(cid:1866)!); 

•  The  start  of  a  StegBlocks  block  is  the  first  object  sent 

within a given group; 

•  The last bit of the number of objects in the block is used 

as the value of the block; 

•  The probability of occurrence of a block with value 1 or 
0 is equal to 1/2 (it is possible to achieve by appropriate 
choice  of  parameters (cid:1866) and (cid:1863) StegBlocks,  e.g.  n  even 
and (cid:1863) equal to 1); 

•  A  change  of  the  value  of  a  block  can  be  made  by 
changing  the  order  of  single  objects  or  changing  the 
order  of  groups  of  objects  (and  thereby  blocks  of 
StegBlocks); 

•  A  hidden  message  is  encrypted  using  a  one-time  pad 
(the Vernam cipher) before inserting the message into a 
carrier. 

Data units for the method with the presented assumptions 

are groups of (cid:1866) objects. 

The proof  was  divided  into  three parts  corresponding  to 
three  conditions  required  to  achieve  perfect  undetectability 
according to Def. 2: 
•  Knowledge of  bits  of  the  hidden  message (condition  1: 

(cid:1834)(cid:4666)(cid:1845)|(cid:1839)(cid:4667) = (cid:1834)(cid:4666)(cid:1845)(cid:4667)); 

•  Distribution of data units (condition 2: (cid:1830)(cid:4666)(cid:1842)(cid:3004)||(cid:1842)(cid:3020)(cid:4667) = 0); 
•  Distribution  of  times  between  sending/receiving  data 

units (condition 3: (cid:3435)(cid:1842)(cid:3004)(cid:3295) || (cid:1842)(cid:3020)(cid:3295)(cid:3439) = 0). 
The  theorem  was  proved  by  showing  that  all  three 
conditions  required  for  perfect  undetectability  of  a  network 
steganography method (according to Def. 2) are satisfied for 
the  method  based  on  StegBlocks  with  the  above-mentioned 
assumptions. 

1)  Knowledge of bits of hidden message 

In  order  to  show  that  knowledge  of  bits  of  a  hidden 
message  does  not  allow  for  determining  if  a  network 
steganography  method  based  on  StegBlocks  is  used,  it  is 
necessary to check the value of the conditional entropy of a 
steganogram  and  a  hidden  message.  If  the  conditional 
entropy  of  a  steganogram  and  a  hidden  message is  equal  to 
the  entropy  of  a  steganogram,  then  the  knowledge  of  a 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hidden  message  does  not  allow  for  any  information  on  the 
steganogram  to  be  gained.  This  means  that  knowledge  of  a 
hidden  message  does  not  help  in  determining  if  network 
steganography has been used. 

the  assumptions  regarding 

The condition (cid:1834)(cid:4666)(cid:1845)|(cid:1839)(cid:4667) = (cid:1834)(cid:4666)(cid:1845)(cid:4667) is equivalent to condition 
(cid:1842)(cid:1870)(cid:4666)(cid:1845) = (cid:1871)|(cid:1839) = (cid:1865)(cid:4667) = (cid:1842)(cid:1870)(cid:4666)(cid:1845) = (cid:1871)(cid:4667) for  each (cid:1871) (cid:1488) (cid:1845) and (cid:1865) (cid:1488) (cid:1839) 
(s is a steganogram and (cid:1865) is a hidden message). According 
to 
the  considered  network 
steganography method the probability of block of value 1 or 
0 is equal to 1/2. Let (cid:1864) be the length of the key of a one-time 
pad,  and  therefore  at  the  same  time  the  length  of  a  secret

2)  Distribution of data units 

independent  and 

Each data unit of the considered network steganography 
method  (group  of  (cid:1866)  objects)  is  a  permutation  of  the 
(cid:4668)1,2,3, … (cid:1866)(cid:4669)  set.  According  to  the  assumptions  of  the 
the 
method,  groups  of  objects  are 
probability  of  the  occurrence  of  each  group  is  the  same  
( 1/(cid:1866)! ).  Let  (cid:4668)(cid:1857)(cid:2868), (cid:1857)(cid:2869), (cid:1857)(cid:2870), … (cid:1857)(cid:3041)!(cid:4669)  be  a  set  of  all  possible 
permutations  of  the  (cid:4668)1,2,3, … (cid:1866)(cid:4669)  set  and  let  the  values  of 
blocks determined by the groups (cid:1857)(cid:3036), where (cid:1861) is odd, be equal 
to  1,  and  the  values  of  other  blocks  be  0.  In  addition,  let 
(cid:1850) = (cid:1876)(cid:2869), (cid:1876)(cid:2870), … , (cid:1876)(cid:3050)  be  a  hidden  message  encrypted  with  the 
Vernam  cipher.  Then,  assuring  that  values  of  blocks  are 
equal  to  bits  of  encrypted  hidden  message  can  be  achieved 
through  the  choice  of  subsequent  groups  of  objects  in  the 
following way: 

                             (cid:1871)(cid:3037) = (cid:1857)(cid:4672)(cid:3036)(cid:3031)(cid:3285)(cid:2878)(cid:3435)(cid:3051)(cid:3285)(cid:1618)(cid:3049)(cid:3285)(cid:3439)(cid:4673) (cid:3040)(cid:3042)(cid:3031) (cid:3041)!                        (3) 
where: 
(cid:1861)(cid:1856)(cid:3037) is an identifier of the j-th group of objects, which would 
be sent if steganography were not used; 
(cid:1874)(cid:3037)  is  a  value  of  a  block  determined  by  the  j-th  group  of 
objects,  which  would  be  sent  if  steganography  were  not 
used; 
(cid:1871)(cid:3037) is the j-th element of the steganogram (group of objects). 

Due to the fact that (cid:1876)(cid:3037) are the subsequent bits of a hidden 
message encrypted with the Vernam cipher, the applied way 
of  assuring  that  values  of  blocks  are  equal  to  bits  of  an 
encrypted  hidden  message  is  not  changing  the  probability 
distribution of data units, so the relationship (cid:1830)(cid:4666)(cid:1842)(cid:3015)||(cid:1842)(cid:3020)(cid:4667) = 0 
is true.

delays caused by inserting secret message into a carrier, 
ensuring  error-free  steganographic  communication  in 
the  case  of  additional  delays  and 
losses  during 
transmission. 

It is possible to eliminate the delays caused by inserting a 
secret  message  into  a  carrier  by  using  the  control  of  the 
entire communication as a way of changing values of blocks 
of StegBlocks. The determination of objects to be sent before 
the  transmission  actually  starts  prevents  potential  additional 
delays during connection if the order of the objects needs to 
be changed. 

Delays and losses during transmission may influence the 
method  of  changing 
the  order  of  objects  based  on 
StegBlocks,  which  could  lead  to  the  incorrect  extraction  of 
the  hidden  message  by  the  receiver.  In  the  case  of  the 
StegBlocks SCTP method this is not an issue, as the order of 
the  objects  is  determined  based  on  the  TSN,  not  the  actual 
time  of  their  reception.  Therefore,  there  is  no  need  for  an 
additional  mechanism  preventing  the  incorrect  reception  of 
steganographic  data  and  there  is  no  influence  on  the  times 
between sending/receiving data units ((cid:1830)(cid:3435)(cid:1842)(cid:3015)(cid:3295) || (cid:1842)(cid:3020)(cid:3295)(cid:3439) = 0).

V.  CONCLUSIONS 

In this paper, a new concept for performing undetectable 
network  steganography  communication,  called  StegBlocks, 
was  presented.  StegBlocks  is  a  framework  for  the  creation 
of  network  steganography  methods.  It  defines  the  way  in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which the methods work and at the same time allows for the 
creation of methods for various carriers (network protocols). 
Moreover, the paper contains the definition of perfectly 
undetectable network steganography. The definition is based 
on  the  definitions  for  general  steganography  developed  by 
Cachin [7]. We adjusted this definition to cover the specific 
features of network steganography. 

Finally,  the  definition  of  perfect  undetectability  was 
used  to  show  that  it  is  possible  to  create  a  network 
steganography  method  based  on  StegBlocks  which  is 
perfectly  undetectable  (undetectable  for  the  adversary  with 
unlimited computational power). 

Although the ideas presented in this paper may seem to 
have limited practical applications, their objective is to show 
the possibility of a  more thorough approach to the analysis 
of  the  undetectability  of  network  steganography  than  is 
currently  used 
the 
publications related to network steganography do not focus 
enough  on  undetectability.  We  hope  that  this  article  will 
spur more research regarding the undetectability of network 
steganography.
