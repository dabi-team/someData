Exact insurance premiums for cyber risk
of small and medium-sized enterprises

Stefano Chiaradonna and Nicolas Lanchier∗
Abstract As cyber attacks have become more frequent, cyber insurance premiums have in-
creased, resulting in the need for better modeling of cyber risk. Toward this direction, Jevti´c
and Lanchier (2020) proposed a dynamic structural model of aggregate loss distribution for
cyber risk of small and medium-sized enterprises under the assumption of a tree-based local-
area-network topology that consists of the combination of a Poisson process, homogeneous
random trees, bond percolation processes, and cost topology. Their model assumes that the
contagion spreads through the edges of the network with the same ﬁxed probability in both
directions, thus overlooking a dynamic cyber security environment implemented in most net-
works, and their results give an exact expression for the mean of the aggregate loss but only
a rough upper bound for the variance. In this paper, we consider a bidirectional version of
their percolation model in which the contagion spreads through the edges of the network with
a certain probability moving toward the lower level assets of the network but with another
probability moving toward the higher level assets of the network, which results in a more
realistic cyber security environment. In addition, our mathematical approach is quite diﬀerent
and leads to exact expressions for both the mean and the variance of the agregate loss, and
therefore an exact expression for the insurance premiums.

1. Introduction

According to The Institute of Risk Management, cyber risk is “any risk of ﬁnancial loss, disrup-
tion or damage to the reputation of an organization from some sort of failure of its information
technology systems” [18]. Following [10], we deﬁne cyber risk due to a data breach as “the risk
of a ﬁnancial loss caused by a breach of an institution’s IT infrastructure by unauthorized par-
ties, resulting in exploitation, taking possession of, or disclosure of data assets”. Cyber risk has
attracted considerable attention within the past years due to the rapidly growing number of cy-
ber attacks [22]. In the ﬁrst six months of 2021, there were 2.5 billion malware attacks and 2.5
trillion intrusion attempts in which an intruder gains or attempts to gain unauthorized access to
a system or its network [17, 12]. Malicious actors could steal information by exploiting vulnerable
privileges, which are actions a user is permitted to perform on an asset, and accounts, which are
a set of privileges given to a user [2]. Some users, especially domain administrators, have network
accounts with privileges that give them greater access to information technology (IT) resources,
such as other systems in the network or the entire network itself because they can bypass critical
security settings [8, 5]. Once malicious actors have obtained the credentials of an authorized user,
they could use the stolen account credentials and privileges to try to elevate their own privileges
to a higher administrator-level access and travel from system to system in the network [8]. Be-
cause privileged accounts have greater access to the network, credentials remain one of the most
sought-after data assets by attackers [8, 17, 2]. According to the Verizon Data Breach Investiga-
tions (2018) report, credentials, phishing, and privileges abuse are three of the top ﬁve malicious

actions in breaches in 2018 [20]. Out of the 3,841 incidents analyzed in the Verizon Data Breach
Investigations (2021) report, of which 1,767 had conﬁrmed data disclosure, the data compromised
was credentials at 85% [21].

Due to the increase in cyber risks, there has been more demand for cyber insurance [19] as
companies have been underestimating the ﬁnancial impact of cyber risk, so they purchase more
coverage or higher limits [1]. According to [19], analysis of data from S&P Market Intelligence and
National Association of Insurance Commissioners, there was a 60% increase of cyber insurance
policies from 2016 to 2019 and approximately a 50% increase in the amount of total direct written
premiums from $2.1 billion to $3.1 billion. In the UK, the number of cyber insurance claims doubled
between 2019 and 2020 [1]. For all companies with more than $500 million in annual revenue in
2020, the average cyber insurance limits rose by 2% [1]. In 2020, there was an increase of about 15%
on average of cyber insurance pricing [1]. More than half of the brokers surveyed by [19] reported
that their clients saw a 10-30% price increase in their cyber insurance premiums. More companies
are purchasing cyber insurance largely due to the growing number of cyber attacks [1] despite the
seeing higher insurance prices due to increased severity and frequency of the attacks [19]. Many
small to midsize companies are seeking coverage against data loss, revenue loss due to data breach,
legal expenses, and other costs [9, 6, 22]. For small and midsize enterprises, the average cost of a
data breach was $178 thousand [13], so cyber insurance provides a supposed second line of defense
to control and mitigate cyber attacks [3]. However, pricing cyber risk insurance products is still
very new due to its unique characteristics, such as the lack of standard scoring system or actuarial
tables for rate making [22]. Cyber risk, like many other operational risks, does not have readily
available experience data because it relies on the organization’s network [16]. In 2015, [7] used a
traditional actuarial approach for calculating the frequency and severity of loss due to a cyber
attack; however they assumed that the “causal structure of risks remains relatively stable over
time” [3, 14]. Due to the inherent nature of technological advancements, cyber risk is dynamic,
so reliance on historical cyber risk data could be misleading [7, 3]. Therefore, traditional actuarial
modelling is insuﬃcient for cyber insurance. Instead, cyber risk should be modelled based on a
network structure due to the organization’s cyber security environment, which is the resilience of
the organization’s network [4, 3]. Network resilience describes the network’s ability to function in
the presence of adverse conditions [11]. Considering the organization’s network resilience, one can
have a better understanding of an optimal risk management strategy [3].

Other papers have taken the approach of calculating the ﬁnancial loss in cyber risk. Amin (2019)
developed a structure for a Bayesian network to model the ﬁnancial loss as function of the key
drivers of risk and resilience [3]. Xu and Hua (2019) studied the cybersecurity risks via epidemic
models involving loss functions and pricing strategies as well as providing a review of other mathe-
matical models that calculate cyber risk [22]. Antonio and Indratno (2021) also used an epidemic
model on regular networks to simulate the process of a virus spreading and calculating the total
loss [4]. However, none of these models fully utilize the aspect of cyber resilience, which is very
much connected with bond percolation [10, 11].

The dynamical model designed in [10] consists of several components, including a bond perco-
lation process, to calculate the aggregate loss resulting from consecutive cyber attacks on a tree
based local area network of small and midsize enterprises. The percolation process assumes that
the contagion spreads through the edges of the network with a ﬁxed probability, thus modeling
a static cyber security environment. In this paper, we extend their model by assuming that the
contagion spreads through the edges with a certain probability moving toward the lower levels of

Exact insurance premiums for cyber risk of small and medium-sized enterprises

the network but with another (typically smaller) probability moving toward the upper levels of the
network, thus resulting in a bidirectional version of the percolation component in [10] that accounts
for administrative privileges. Administrative privileges make it more diﬃcult for a malicious actor
to spread malware throughout the network and to elevate their own privileges [5, 8]. By controlling
the accounts that allow access to certain accounts, an enterprise improves its ability to protect its
more valuable assets [2]. Therefore, our bidirectional version leads to a more realistic cyber security
environment by incorporating administrative privileges, but one could also consider other forms of
internal network cyber security such as ﬁrewalls [15]. In addition, while [10] only obtained a rough
upper bound for the variance of the aggregate loss, our analysis relies on other techniques that
lead to an exact expression of the variance, and therefore an exact expression for the insurance
premiums.

2. Model description

As previously explained, the model we consider in this paper is a bidirectional version of the model
introduced in [10]. In this section, we give a rigorous description including ﬁve components. To
begin with, we assume that the cyber attacks occur in continuous time at a constant rate:

1. we let (Nt) be a Poisson process with intensity λ,

and assume that the ith attack occurs at time

Ti = inf{t : Nt = i}

for

i = 1, 2, . . .

At the times of the attacks, the local area network consists of a random tree. Depending on whether
the network is static or dynamic, the network can be ﬁxed once and for all or can consist of a
sequence of independent realizations of the random tree, but we point out that our results are not
sensitive to this distinction. More precisely, in the dynamical context,

2. we let Ti = (Vi, Ei) be independent realizations of the Galton-Watson tree with radius R,
i.e., there are k vertices connected to the root with probability pk, then k additional vertices
connected to each of those vertices with probability pk, and so on, up to generation R. To
ensure that the tree has radius R and avoid trivialities, we assume p0 = 0.

In the terminology of branching processes, the probabilities pk are referred to as the oﬀspring
distribution, and two vertices connected by an edge are called the parent and the oﬀspring, with
the parent being the vertex closer to the root. Next, to ﬁx the source of the attack,

3. we let Xi ∈ Vi be a vertex chosen at random.

The actual distribution of Xi is unimportant for this work since our objective is to compute the
insurance premium as a function of Xi. Now, to model the contagion itself (how the infection
spreads through the network from the source), we use bidirectional bond percolation:

4. we let p, q ∈ (0, 1), and assume that each edge of the tree is independently open

with probability p

in the direction parent → oﬀspring

with probability q

in the direction oﬀspring → parent.

In other words, each edge is identiﬁed to two arrows. The arrow going away from the root is open
with probability p whereas the arrow going toward the root is open with probability q. As previously

4

Stefano Chiaradonna and Nicolas Lanchier

mentioned, the distinction between p and q is motivated by the presence of administrative privileges
suggesting that the infection spreads more easily moving away from the root than toward the root,
meaning that p > q. The model in [10] corresponds to the particular case p = q. Then, the set of
infected vertices is the open percolation cluster starting from the source:

Ci = {y ∈ Vi : there is a directed open path Xi → y}.

To deﬁne the aggregate loss, the last step is to assign a cost to the percolation cluster:

5. we let ci,y for all i > 0 and y ∈ Vi be independent and identically distributed

and think of this random variable as the cost of vertex y. Then, the total loss resulting from the ith
cyber attack and the aggregate loss up to time t are given respectively by

Ci =

(cid:88)

y∈Ci

ci,y

and Lt =

Nt(cid:88)

i=1

Ci =

Nt(cid:88)

(cid:88)

i=1

y∈Ci

ci,y.

In other words, the loss resulting from the ith cyber attack is the total cost of all the vertices that
have been infected during the attack, and the aggregate loss is the cumulative loss resulting from
all the cyber attacks that occurred by time t.

3. Main results

Our main objective is to compute the mean and variance of Lt as insurance premiums are calculated
from these two quantities. To state our results and express the mean and variance of the aggregate
loss, we need some key quantities. First, we let µ and σ2 be respectively the mean and variance of
the oﬀspring distribution (the random number of edges starting from each vertex):

µ =

∞
(cid:88)

k=1

kpk

and σ2 =

∞
(cid:88)

k=1

(k − µ)2pk.

Recalling that the local costs ci,y are identically distributed, to simplify the notation, we let c denote
their common distribution. Similarly, because the consecutive Galton-Watson trees, percolation
processes, sources of infection, and local costs are identically distributed, the numbers of infected
vertices Si = card (Ci) are also identically distributed, and we let S denote the common distribution
of the size of the consecutive percolation clusters. The model parameters (oﬀspring distribution,
distribution of the source, percolation parameters p and q, and distribution of the local costs) vary
from one company to another, and the goal of this paper is not to estimate these parameters.
Instead, our main objective is to compute explicitly the mean and variance of the aggregate loss,
and therefore the insurance premiums, as a function of these parameters.

Aggregate loss. The aggregate loss can be expressed using the loss resulting from a single attack
by conditioning on the number of attacks. Similarly, the loss resulting from a single attack can be
expressed using the local cost c by conditioning on the cluster size S. Using also that the number
of attacks is Poisson distributed, we obtain the following result.

Theorem 1 – The mean and variance of the aggregate loss are given by

E(Lt) = λtE(S)E(c) and Var(Lt) = λtE(S) Var(c) + λtE(S2)(E(c))2.

In particular, the theorem shows that the mean and variance of the aggregate loss depends on
the ﬁrst and second moments of the size of the infected cluster therefore, in order to compute the
insurance premiums, the next step is to compute those two quantities.

First moment. To begin with, we look at the ﬁrst moment of the cluster size. This quantity has
been computed explicitly in [10] in the symmetric case p = q using combinatorial techniques. To
extend their result to the more general asymmetric case, we partition the set of infected vertices
into subtrees and use linearity of the expectation, which gives the following theorem.

Theorem 2 – The conditional ﬁrst moment on the tree with radius R given that the infection
starts at distance r from the root is equal to

Er(S) =

1
1 − µp

(cid:18)

1 + q

(cid:18) 1 − qr
1 − q

(cid:19)

(1 − p) − (µp)R−r+1

(cid:18) 1 − pq(1 + (µ − 1)(µpq)r)
1 − µpq

(cid:19)(cid:19)

.

Note that setting p = q in the theorem gives

Er(S) =

1
1 − µp

(cid:18)

1 + p(1 − pr) − (µp)R−r+1

(cid:18) 1 − p2(1 + (µ − 1)(µp2)r)
1 − µp2

(cid:19)(cid:19)

,

which is exactly the expression found in [10, Theorem 4], but we point out that, even though our
result extends the result in [10] to the asymmetric case, our approach leads to a much shorter and
more elegant proof. More precisely, the proof in [10] relies on a tedious combinatorial argument
that consists in counting the number of open paths of a given length starting from the source of the
infection whereas our proof consists in ﬁnding the infected vertices along the path going from the
source of the infection to the root of the tree and then partitioning the cluster of infected vertices
into (disjoint) subtrees starting from each of these vertices.

Second moment. Our approach to compute the second moment is similar but relies in addition
on independence. More precisely, writing again the cluster of infected vertices as a disjoint union of
subtrees, the second moment can be computed using that the sizes of these subtrees are independent
random variables. To express the second moment of the cluster size, we let

µ+ = µp and µ− = (µ − 1)p,

quantities that will be interpreted later as the mean number of infected oﬀspring in certain subtrees
of the local area network, and

subtrees of the local area network. For all j = 0, 1, . . . , r, we also deﬁne

where qk = qk(1 − q) for k = 0, 1, . . . , r − 1, and qr = qr.

Theorem 3 is the main contribution of this work as it gives an exact expression of the second
moment, which leads to an exact pricing of the standard deviation principle, whereas [10, Theorem 5]
only derived a rough upper bound for this pricing. Although the expression is implicit, it can be
computed explicitly using a computer program (see Figure 2) for each set of parameters.

We also point out that the expressions in both Theorems 2 and 3 can be simpliﬁed when the
local area network consists on the inﬁnite Galton-Watson tree. In this case, the percolation process
is supercritical when µp > 1, meaning that the cluster of infected vertices is inﬁnite with positive
probability, so the ﬁrst and second moments are both inﬁnite. In the subcritical phase µp < 1, it
follows from the monotone convergence theorem that the ﬁrst and second moments of the cluster
size on the inﬁnite tree can be obtained by taking the limit as R → ∞ in both theorems. In
particular, in the inﬁnite case, the ﬁrst moment reduces to

Er(S) =

Exponential decay of the diameter. Another quantity of interest which also accounts for the
geometry of the set of infected vertices is the diameter of the cluster C deﬁned as the maximum
graph distance (number of edges) between any two infected vertices:

diam(C ) = max {d(x, y) : x, y ∈ C }.

Figure 1. First moment of the cluster size as a function of p for various values of q and r. In each picture, the mean
and variance of the oﬀspring distribution are µ = σ2 = 5 and the radius of the tree is R = 4.

In this case, studying the spread of the infection from a dynamical point of view starting from the
highest infected vertex and moving one generation down the tree at each time step, we can prove
an exponential decay. More precisely, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 4 – Let µp < 1. Then, the conditional probability that the diameter is larger than 2n
given that the infection starts at distance r from the root is

Pr(diam(C ) ≥ 2n) ≤

1 − (q/µp)r+1
1 − (q/µp)

(µp)n

for all n > r.

The theorem indeed implies that, in the subcritical phase µp < 1, the tail distribution of the
diameter of the cluster of infected vertices decays exponentially.

Insurance premiums. Combining Theorems 1–3, we can now perform an exact pricing of cyber
risk insurance. Following [10], we consider the three pricing principles

actuarial fair premium: P = E(L1)

expectation principle: P = E(L1) + δE(L1)
standard deviation principle: P = E(L1) + δ(cid:112)Var(L1)

showing that all three insurance premiums are functions of the system parameters and the ﬁrst and
second moments of the cluster size. In particular, for each set of parameters (the rate of occurrence
of the cyber attacks, the mean and variance of the oﬀspring distribution and the local costs, etc.),
all three premiums can be computed exactly using Theorems 2 and 3. Because the expressions of
the ﬁrst two moments in the theorems are quite complicated, we refer the reader to Figures 1 and 2
for pictures of the ﬁrst and second moments as functions of the parameters p, q and r, for a ﬁxed
value of the mean and variance of the oﬀspring distribution. The dashed curves in the pictures
correspond to the symmetric case p = q considered in [10] where the ﬁrst moment was computed
exactly while only a very rough upper bound for the second moment was derived. In contrast, the
approach used in this paper leads to exact insurance premiums for all three principles.

Not surprisingly, it follows from (5) that all three premiums are nondecreasing with respect to
the rate λ and the mean and variance of the local costs. The ﬁgures also show that both the ﬁrst
and the second moments of the cluster size are nondecreasing with respect to p and q and so are
the three premiums. This result is intuitively clear and can be proved rigorously using a popular
technique in probability theory called coupling, which consists in this case in constructing bond

percolation processes with diﬀerent parameters on the same probability space. We note however
that the cluster size and the insurance premiums are not always increasing or always decreasing
with respect to r, the distance from the root to the source of the infection. Indeed,

• When p = 1 and q = 0, the set of infected vertices consists of the subtree starting from the
source of the infection going away from the root are therefore, in this case, the cluster size
and the premiums are decreasing with respect to r.

• When p = 0 and q = 1, the set of infected vertices consists of the unique path going from the
source of the infection to the root of the tree are therefore, in this case, the cluster size and
the premiums are increasing with respect to r.

The rest of this paper is devoted to the proof of the four theorems.

4. Proof of Theorem 1 (aggregate loss)

To prove Theorem 1, we ﬁrst observe that, because the Galton-Watson trees, percolation processes
and local costs are independent and identically distributed across time, the consecutive costs Ci are
independent and identically distributed as well. In particular, letting C be the common distribution
of the random variables Ci and conditioning on the number of cyber attacks Nt, we get

E(Lt | Nt = n) = E(C1 + · · · + CNt | Nt = n) = nE(C)

Var(Lt | Nt = n) = Var(C1 + · · · + CNt | Nt = n) = n Var(C).

The ﬁrst equation in (6) implies that

E(Lt) = E(E(Lt | Nt)) = E(NtE(C)) = E(Nt)E(C)

while using also the second equation in (6) and the law of total variance,

Var(Lt) = E(Var(Lt | Nt)) + Var(E(Lt | Nt)) = E(Nt Var(C)) + Var(NtE(C))

= E(Nt) Var(C) + Var(Nt)(E(C))2.

(6)

(7)

(8)

Using that the local costs are independent and identically distributed across the local area network,
and conditioning on the size S of a single cyber attack, we also have

E(C | S = s) = sE(c)

and Var(C | S = s) = s Var(c).

The ﬁrst equation in (9) implies that

E(C) = E(E(C | S)) = E(SE(c)) = E(S)E(c)

while using also the second equation in (9) and the law of total variance,

Var(C) = E(Var(C | S)) + Var(E(C | S)) = E(S Var(c)) + Var(SE(c))

= E(S) Var(c) + Var(S)(E(c))2.

Finally, using that E(Nt) = Var(Nt) = λt, and combining (7) and (10), we get

E(Lt) = λtE(C) = λtE(S)E(c).

(9)

(10)

(11)

10

Stefano Chiaradonna and Nicolas Lanchier

Combining (8), (10) and (11), and using that Var(S) + (E(S))2 = E(S2), we get

Var(Lt) = λt Var(C) + λt(E(C))2

= λtE(S) Var(c) + λt Var(S)(E(c))2 + λt(E(S)E(c))2
= λtE(S) Var(c) + λtE(S2)(E(c))2.

This completes the proof of the theorem.

5. Partition into disjoint subtrees

To get ready for the proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 in the next two sections, we ﬁrst describe the
partition of the set of infected vertices into disjoint subtrees and collect several useful preliminary
results that explain the parameters introduced in (1)–(3). More precisely, we study the distribution
of the random number of subtrees and compute the ﬁrst and second moment of the size of these
subtrees. From now on, we assume that the infection starts at a vertex x with d(0, x) = r. By
spherical symmetry, the speciﬁc choice of x is unimportant as long as the vertex is at distance r
from the root. There is a unique directed path

x0 = 0 → x1 → x2 → · · · → xr−1 → xr = x

of length r going from the root to vertex x and we let

D = max {i = 0, 1, . . . , r : xr−i is infected}.

This is the distance between the source of the infection and the highest infected vertex, and we
refer the reader to Figure 3 for a picture. The following lemma gives preliminary results about the
random variable D that will be useful later to prove the theorems.

Lemma 5 – We have

E(D) = q

(cid:19)

(cid:18) 1 − qr
1 − q

and E(D(D − 1)) =

2q2(1 − rqr−1 + (r − 1)qr)
(1 − q)2

.

Proof. Because the infection spreads toward the root of the random tree with probability q
independently through each of the edges, we have

P (D = k) = qk(1 − q)

for k = 0, 1, . . . , r − 1,

and P (D = r) = qr.

(12)

In particular, using that

Figure 3. Picture of the partition into disjoint subtrees used to prove Theorems 2 and 3. The black vertices represent
the set of infected vertices while the white vertices are not infected. In our example, the infection starts from x3 and
spreads up to x1, which results in a partition of the cluster of infected vertices into three disjoint subtrees. Starting
from the source of the infection, the numbers of infected vertices in the subtrees are 3, 2 and 5, respectively.

Similarly, we have

=

2q2(1 − rqr−1 + (r − 1)qr)
(1 − q)2

.

This completes the proof. (cid:3)

Next, for j = 0, 1, . . . , r, we deﬁne the random variables

S(xj) = number of infected vertices in the subtree starting at xj
S(xj \ xj+1) = number of infected vertices in the subtree starting at xj

(13)

but excluding the subtree starting at xj+1.

12

For instance, in the realization shown in Figure 3, we have

S(x3) = 3, S(x2 \ x3) = 2, S(x1 \ x2) = 5, S(x0 \ x1) = 0.

To estimate the ﬁrst and second moments of the size of the infected cluster later, we now compute
the ﬁrst and second moments of the random variables in (13). To do this, let ξi = Bernoulli (p)
be independent, and let Y be the oﬀspring distribution, i.e., the random variable describing the
number of edges starting from a given vertex and going away from the root. In particular,

X+ = ξ1 + ξ2 + · · · + ξY

and X− = ξ1 + ξ2 + · · · + ξY −1

are the random variables describing the number of infected oﬀspring of a given vertex and the
number of infected oﬀspring of a given vertex excluding a given oﬀspring, respectively. The next
two lemmas give the mean and the variance of these two random variables.

Lemma 6 – We have E(X+) = µ+ and E(X−) = µ− as deﬁned in (1).

Proof. Conditioning on Y , we get

E(X+) = E(E(X+ | Y )) = E(E(ξ1 + · · · + ξY | Y )) = E(Y )E(ξn) = µp = µ+.

Similarly, for the mean of X−,

E(X−) = E(E(X− | Y )) = E(E(ξ1 + · · · + ξY −1 | Y )) = E(Y − 1)E(ξn) = (µ − 1)p = µ−.

This completes the proof. (cid:3)

Lemma 7 – We have Var(X+) = σ2

+ and Var(X−) = σ2

− as deﬁned in (2).

Proof. Conditioning on Y and using the law of total variance, we get

Var(X+) = E(Var(X+ | Y )) + Var(E(X+ | Y ))

= E(p(1 − p)Y ) + Var(pY ) = p(1 − p)µ + p2σ2 = σ2
+.

Similarly, for the variance of X−,

Var(X−) = E(Var(X− | Y )) + Var(E(X− | Y ))

= E(p(1 − p)(Y − 1)) + Var(p(Y − 1)) = p(1 − p)(µ − 1) + p2σ2 = σ2
−.

This completes the proof. (cid:3)

Now, applying Lemmas 8 and 9 from [10] implies that the ﬁrst and second moments of the ﬁrst set
of random variables in (13) are given respectively by

E(S(xj)) =

E(S(xj)2) =

1 − µR−j+1

which are the expressions in (3). In particular, we have the following lemma.

Exact insurance premiums for cyber risk of small and medium-sized enterprises

Lemma 8 – For all j = 0, 1, . . . , r, we have E(S(xj)) = µ1,j and E(S(xj)2) = µ2,j.

We now look at the second set of random variables in (13).

Lemma 9 – For all j = 0, 1, . . . , r, we have E(S(xj \ xj+1)) = 1 + µ−µ1,j+1 and

E(S(xj \ xj+1)2) = 1 + 2µ−µ1,j+1 + µ−µ2,j+1 + (σ2

− + µ2

− − µ−)(µ1,j+1)2.

Proof. Letting y1, y2, . . . , yX be the infected oﬀspring of xj other than xj+1,

S(xj \ xj+1) = 1 + S(y1) + · · · + S(yX )

and X = X− in distribution.

(14)

In particular, conditioning on X and using Lemmas 6 and 8, we obtain

E(S(xj \ xj+1)) = E(E(1 + S(y1) + · · · + S(yX ) | X))

= 1 + E(X)E(S(y1)) = 1 + µ−E(S(xj+1)) = 1 + µ−µ1,j+1.

Taking the square in (14),

S(xj \ xj+1)2 = 1 + 2

6. Proof of Theorem 2 (ﬁrst moment)

Using the previous lemmas, we are now ready to prove Theorem 2. To begin with, observe that, on
the event D = k, the total number of infected vertices can be written as

S = S(xr) +

7. Proof of Theorem 3 and (4) (second moment)

To prove Theorem 3, we follow the same strategy as for Theorem 2 using also that the numbers of
infected vertices in disjoint subtrees are independent. Taking the square in (15),

S2 = S(xr)2 + 2S(xr)

= S(xr)2 + 2S(xr)

S(xr−i \ xr−i+1) +

then conditioning on the event D = k and using independence of the random variables in (13) (be-
cause they represent the number of infected vertices in disjoint subtrees), we obtain

Er(S2) =

(cid:88)

Then, using Lemmas 8 and 9, and recalling from (12) that

P (D = k) = qk

for all k = 0, 1, . . . , r,

the right-hand side of (18) becomes

Er(S2) =

(cid:19)

This completes the proof of the theorem.

To simplify the previous expression for the second moment when the percolation process is
subcritical µ+ = µp < 1 and the local area network is inﬁnite, and prove (4), we ﬁrst observe
that, by the monotone convergence theorem, the second moment on the inﬁnite tree is equal to
the limit of the second moment on the ﬁnite tree as the radius R → ∞. The reason why the
expression simpliﬁes in the inﬁnite tree limit is because the terms µ1,j and µ2,j no longer depend
on the index j, which is due to the fact that they now represent the ﬁrst and second moments of

16

Stefano Chiaradonna and Nicolas Lanchier

the number of infected vertices on inﬁnite subtrees that are identically distributed. More precisely,
taking the limit as R → ∞ in (3) and using Lemma 8, we get

E(S(xr)) = µ1,r =

1
1 − µ+

and E(S(xr)2) = µ2,r =

(19)

This, together with Lemma 9, implies that

E(S(xr−i \ xr−i+1)2) = 1 + 2µ−µ1,r−i+1 + µ−µ2,r−i+1 + (σ2

8. Proof of Theorem 4 (exponential decay)

To prove exponential decay of the diameter of the cluster of infected vertices, the idea is to study
the process that keeps track of the random number of infected vertices at distance n from the
highest infected vertex in the tree. More precisely, on the event D = k, we let

Xn = card (Cn) where Cn = {x ∈ C : d(x, xr−k) = n}.

Recall that xr−k is the unique vertex along the path connecting the source of the infection and the
root of the tree that is at distance k from the source of the infection. The next lemma shows that,
in the subcritical phase µp < 1, the expected value of the process decays exponentially.

Lemma 10 – Given that the infection starts at distance r from the root,

(cid:40)

Er(Xn+1) =

µp E(Xn) + (1 − p) qn+1
µp E(Xn)

for n < r
for n ≥ r.

Proof. Recall that each vertex produces µ oﬀspring in average and that each of the oﬀspring of
an infected vertex is infected with probability p, from which it follows that each infected vertex
has µp infected oﬀspring in average. Now, given D = k, the process is conditioned so that

xr−k ∈ C0,

xr−k+1 ∈ C1,

. . .

xr−1 ∈ Ck−1

and xr ∈ Ck

are infected so, until generation k −1, the vertices in Cn have µp infected oﬀspring in average except
for vertex xr−k+n that has (µ − 1)p + 1 infected oﬀspring in average. This implies that

Er(Xn+1 | Xn, D = k) =

(cid:40)

µp(Xn − 1) + (µ − 1)p + 1 for n < k
for n ≥ k.

(cid:40)

µp E(Xn) + (1 − p) qn+1
µp E(Xn)

for n < r
for n ≥ r.

This completes the proof. (cid:3)

Er(Xn) = (µp) Er(Xn−1) + (1 − p) qn

= (µp)3Er(Xn−3) + (µp)2(1 − p) qn−2 + (µp)(1 − p) qn−1 + (1 − p) qn
= (µp)nEr(X0) + (1 − p)((µp)n−1 q + (µp)n−2 q2 + · · · + (µp) qn−1 + qn)
≤ (µp)nEr(X0) + (µp)n−1 q + (µp)n−2 q2 + · · · + (µp) qn−1 + qn.

Then, using that Er(X0) = 1, we get

Er(Xn) ≤

n
(cid:88)

k=0

(µp)n−kqk = (µp)n

k=0

1 − (q/µp)n+1

for all n ≤ r.

Observing also that, for all n > r,

Er(Xn) ≤ (µp) Er(Xn−1) ≤ (µp)2Er(Xn−2) ≤ · · · ≤ (µp)n−rEr(Xr)

we conclude that, for all n > r, the diameter exceeds 2n with probability

Pr(diam(C ) ≥ 2n) ≤ Pr(Xn > 0) =

Pr(Xn = k) ≤

k Pr(Xn = k) = Er(Xn)

≤ (µp)n−rEr(Xr) ≤ (µp)n−r 1 − (q/µp)r+1
1 − (q/µp)

(µp)r =

1 − (q/µp)r+1
1 − (q/µp)

(µp)n.

This completes the proof of Theorem 4.
