Abstract—Modern transportation infrastructures are consid-
ered as one of the main sources of the greenhouse gases emitted
into the atmosphere. This situation requires the decision-making
players to enact the mass use of electric vehicles (EVs) which, in
turn, highly demand novel secure communication technologies ro-
bust to various cyber-attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
a novel jamming-robust communication technique for different
outdoor cognitive EV-enabled network cases over mixed radio-
frequency (RF)/visible light communication (VLC) channels. One
EV acts as a relaying node to allow an aggregator to reach the
jammed EV and, at the same time, operates in both RF and VLC
spectrum bands while satisfying interference constraints imposed
by the primary network entities. We derive exact closed-form
analytical expressions for the outage probability and also provide
their asymptotic analysis while considering various channel state
information quality scenarios. Moreover, we quantify the outage
reduction achievable by deploying such mixed VLC/RF channels.
Finally, analytical and simulation results validate the accuracy
of our analysis.

munication (VLC).

I. INTRODUCTION

Current transport infrastructures are regarded as a signiﬁcant
source of the carbon dioxide (CO2) gases emitted into the
atmosphere which consequently increase the global tempera-
ture. For instance, it was noticed that the transport-based CO2
emission comprises 27% of the entire greenhouse impact in
the United States [1]. Therefore, a smooth transition from a
carbon-greedy society to a carbon-free one can sufﬁciently
improve this situation. Known for being highly efﬁcient with
low CO2 emission and better performance, electrical vehicles
(EVs) have recently received signiﬁcant public attention as an
effective way to reduce the overall level of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, mass exploitation of EVs imposes several
requirements on the current power grid (PG) systems such as
being able to generate, aggregate and distribute large amounts
of low-carbon energy in a real-time manner.

Such an integration of the EVs and PG is enabled by
means of a reliable and secure bi-directional communication

networks. Therefore, several communication technologies (i.e.,
Zigbee, WiFi, WiMAX, power-line communication (PLC) and
cognitive radio (CR) networks) have been applied to support
an interaction between the PG and individual EVs [2], [3].
For instance, Zigbee is a low-cost solution that can provide
a satisfactory rate of 250 kbit/s and mostly suitable for intra-
vehicle communications. At the same time, this technology has
some drawbacks such as low delay tolerance and vulnerability
to the engine noise and radio-frequency (RF) interference [4].
Moreover, the authors in [5], [6] derived closed-form bit-
error rate expressions and investigated the diversity of the
proposed hybrid PLC/RF technique for the PG and vehicle-
to-grid communications.

Integrating the PG with different communication technolo-
gies not only improves the efﬁciency and ﬂexibility of the PG
but also makes the latter vulnerable to cyber security risks typ-
ical to these communication systems [3], [7]. In general, these
cyber security threats are usually divided into four categories:
authenticity, integrity, conﬁdentiality, and availability [8]. The
latter is the most important one to maintain communication
services. For example, the loss of availability does not allow
the PG to dynamically respond to the real-time power requests.
On the other hand, the EVs which are disconnected from
the PG will experience poor charging services. With the
public information in the commercial wireless systems, illegal
nodes can jam or distort the RF signal at the destination by
transmitting an interfering signal over the air. As a result, the
jammed or distorted received signal becomes unrecognizable.
Such jamming attacks performed against the critical PG node
can disable the operation of a large area since a central
service controller does not obtain accurate load information.
Consequently, local load unbalancing can affect a broader area
[3].

The exponentially growing number of wireless devices
and massive EV exploitation naturally result in RF spectrum
scarcity which can be handled by using the CR paradigm
[9]–[12]. CR is an emerging wireless technology allowing an
unlicensed user, known as a secondary user (SU), to use a
licensed spectrum band such that a primary user (PU) does
not experience harmful interference caused by the SUs [12].
Such communication can be organized using three known
approaches, i.e., interweave, underlay and overlay, which have
different operational modes [13]. For instance, the underlay
CR grants permission to the SUs to operate in the licensed
spectrum given that this communication does not result in
excessive interference power at the PUs, which is referred to as
an interference temperature constraint (ITC) [14]. Moreover, it

 
 
 
 
 
 
is worth mentioning that the CR features perfectly match the
mass EV exploitation. In general, the EVs are highly dynamic
and therefore can connect to the PG at any site irrespective
of the type of a certain local communication network. Re-
garding the jamming attacks, the conventional anti-jamming
techniques, e.g., frequency-hopping spread spectrum, direct-
sequence spread spectrum, etc., can not be applied to the CR
network since they do not take into account the unavoidable
impact of the presence of primary network entities [3], [15].
Recently, visible light communications (VLC) has emerged
as an attractive candidate to resolve the RF spectrum scarcity
and avoid the CR restrictions simultaneously [16]–[19]. The
main advantages of VLC technology are its electromagnetic
immunity to the RF interference and the availability of a wide
unregulated visible light spectrum range (from 430 THz to
790 THz) used for concurrent illumination and communication
purposes. This technology can be applied to the indoor and
outdoor environments. For example, the authors in [18] inves-
tigated the outage performance of the indoor non-orthogonal
multiple access based VLC network scenario. In [19], it was
experimentally demonstrated that the outdoor VLC channels
follow the Rician statistical distribution.

In this paper, we considered the downlink outdoor electric
vehicular network when one EV is used as a relay to commu-
nicate with another EV whose direct link to the aggregator
is jammed. We also specify several EV network scenarios
to fully investigate the outage performance. Hence, our con-
tributions are as follows. First, new closed-form analytical
expressions were derived for the outage probability (OP) in
outdoor cognitive relaying networks over mixed RF-RF/VLC
channels. Second, we quantify the outage reduction enabled by
deploying such a hybrid VLC/RF communication link. Third,
we asymptotically analyze the OP and the corresponding
outage reduction using the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
approximation and perfect CSI scenario. Forth, the provided
analysis is validated by a good agreement with Monte Carlo
simulations.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we describe the system model while, in Section III,
we derive the closed-form expressions for the OP and outage
reduction of the considered system model. In Section IV, we
present analytical and simulation results and their discussion.
Next, we summarize the paper with main concluding remarks
in Section V. Finally, the analytical OP expressions over the
RF/RF channels and of the asymptotic outage reduction are
presented in Appendices A and B, respectively.

II. SYSTEM MODEL

The adopted system model represents a downlink outdoor
underlay cognitive radio network scenario represented by a
mixture of the primary and secondary networks consisting of
an aggregator (i.e., a source node denoted by S), two electrical
vehicles (EV 1 and EV 2), a jamming node (J) and a primary
user (U ). The network scenario can be described as follows.
The primary network (PN) utilizes a given set of frequencies
(i.e., a pool of the frequencies) for communication purposes.
As being part of the PN, the aggregator attempts to send

information to the destination node (i.e., EV 1 denoted by D)
using one vacant frequency from the pool while the other EV
(i.e., EV 2) is idle (e.g., parked and getting charged). At this
moment, J suppresses the communication link between S and
D. To overcome this, S selects another frequency (e.g., it can
be vacant or occupied) from the pool to reach the jammed
EV via the idle EV 2 that will act as a relay node (in the
detect-and-forward mode and denoted by R). For the sake of
practicality of the system setup, we consider four (4) cases
given below:

• Case 1: the newly selected frequencies are already be-
ing used in the PN such that the establishment of an
end-to-end S-to-D relay-assisted communication session
causes interference to the primary nodes exploiting these
frequencies. Thus, underlay CR mode is needed.

• Case 2: one of the selected frequencies is vacant in the
PN such that S can be assigned with it to establish the
communication link between S and R with no interfer-
ence at U . On the other hand, the other frequency utilized
for the R-to-D communication session is occupied and,
thus, may lead to the intolerable level of interference at
U . Then, the power constraint at R is required.

• Case 3: this case is similar to Case 2 with only difference,
i.e., the interference at U is caused by S only that needs
to be power-restricted.

• Case 4: the frequencies selected from the pool for an
end-to-end S-to-D relay-assisted communication session
are vacant and can be exploited for interference-free
communication in the PN.

The end-to-end communication is realized over two identical
time slots, with duration of T /2 each, where T stands for the
time period over which the channel estimates are assumed to
remain constant. To avoid intolerable interference in the PN,
the aggregator and EV 2, i.e., S and R, have to restrict their
transmit power levels, if needed, as

is the
maximum allowed transmit power at node2 i. hiU , diU and
τ indicate the channel coefﬁcient between U and node i, the
corresponding distance and the path-loss exponent, respec-
tively. The communication sessions in the PN and between
the aggregator and relay are organized in the RF spectrum
due to its wide coverage and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) nature
while the EVs communicate with each other through the RF
or VLC channels.

The RF links are modeled by considering imperfect channel

state information (CSI) as follows [11]

It is reasonable to assume that D (i.e., EV 1) can acquire

transmits the data over the best channel4. Hence, the received
RF signal at D can be written as

1Without

loss of generality, we assume that orthogonal resources are
assigned to all primary users. Hence, the SN communication session creates
interference to only one primary receiver, i.e., U .

2This implies that the aggregator is also involved into the secondary network
(SN) during the communication session operating on the chosen frequency
channel. In other words, the aggregator can be treated as a gateway node
between the primary and secondary networks.

3In different network scenarios, it is common for the nodes to exploit pilot
signals in a cyclic manner for the channel estimation and synchronization
purposes [21, §12.3.1]. Thus, secondary nodes are also able to acquire
their own channel estimates between the primary/secondary transmitters and
themselves through participating in this training process [20].

channel is identical to the best relay selection scheme [22].

Regarding the VLC communication link, we consider out-
door vehicular visible light communications (V2LC), where
a point-to-point communication link is established between a
headlight of EV 2 and the tail of EV 1. The headlight uses
light-emitting diode (LED) as the transmitter and a positive-
intrinsic-negative photodetector (PIN PD) is installed on the
tail as the receiver. Such a link experiences Rician fading as
experimentally veriﬁed in [19]. Therefore, the received signal
can be expressed as

D = ρgLgRx + nI

= ρgL˜gRx + ρgLǫx + nI ,

(7)

where gL is the path-loss following Lambertian emission, ρ
denotes the effective photo-current conversion ratio, gR is the
atmospheric turbulence, and the nI is a Gaussian variable with
variance σ2

In this section, we derive analytical expression of the outage

constraints deployed at S and R. The outage expressions for
Cases 2-4 can be derived by following the same approach.

To obtain meaningful insights on the impact of the involved
fading parameters on the network performance, we investigate
the system performance in the high SNR regime. By setting
, the high SNR approximation of the end-

{
to-end OP for all Cases can be expressed as the (a) expressions
given by Eqs. (32), (35), (38) and (41), where the terms
, in the OP expressions represent the impact of
Σi, i
CR communication5. Moreover, further approximation given
by the (b) expressions in Eqs. (33), (36) and (39) represent
the scenario when the transmit power levels PS and PR are
not constrained by Eq. (1), i.e., the secondary communication
). Another useful
does not harm the primary receiver (IU → ∞
insight is that the (b) expressions related to all Cases coincide
with each other, and this implies that they imitate Case 4, as
expected. As it can be seen from the general expressions of the
approximated OP, it depends on the quality of CSI estimates
and the maximum level of interference that U can tolerate.
Moreover, the outage expressions can be further simpliﬁed
by applying ex = 1 + x for small x as in Eqs. (34), (37),
(40) and (42), shown at the top of the next page, where

It

is interesting to quantify the performance advantage
of exploiting such a dual-hop CR network comprising two
complementary wireless technologies. This advantage can be
effectively evaluated in terms of communication reliability,
i.e., reduction of outage. With this in mind, we deﬁne the OP
achievable by the dual-hop RF-based CR network as in Eqs.
(47)-(50) (see Appendix A). Therefore, the outage reduction
can be deﬁned as

of the next pages. Moreover, their high SNR approximation
can be further expressed as in Eqs. (51)-(53) (for more detail,
please refer to Appendix B). From them, we can observe
that the outage performance of the considered system model
improves as both ΣS and ΣR tend to 1. Finally, it is worth
noting that, unlike the other involved terms, the ITC term is the
most critical one since the outage beneﬁt severely decreases
as IU increases and consequently results in performance
saturation.

that the LED and PIN PD comprising the secondary VLC
communication link are aligned along a line perpendicular to
the LED and PIN PD planes. Otherwise, the VLC channel
gain will be decreased. Therefore, for simulation purposes,
i.e., 10 m and 20 m,
we assume two different distances,

with the corresponding VLC channel gains of -65 dB and
-71 dB, respectively (calculated with respect to the simulation
parameters given in Table I). We also assume that, in the case
of the RF channel, the transmit power levels at the source and
relay nodes are the same, i.e., P = PS = PR.

In Fig. 2, we present some analytical and simulation re-
sults on the outage performance achievable by the proposed
technique and conventional dual-hop RF-based scheme. The
latter one is chosen as a benchmark to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme. As it can be seen in
Fig. 2, the mixed RF/VLC technique always outperforms the
RF one for various CSI scenarios. We evaluate the OP metric
versus the transmit SNR which is deﬁned as ξRayl = P/σ2
and ξRice = Pt/σ2
I (for simplicity, we assume the same
transmit SNR values to both RF and VLC communication

links, i.e., ξ = ξRayl = ξRice)6. First, we consider the outage
performance when dRD = 10 m and IU = 15 dB imposed at
both S and R.

In Case 1, the outage curve (a black dash-dot line) ex-
periences two-stage saturation at 40 dB and 160 dB which
can be explained as follows. The ﬁrst saturation occurs due
to the power restriction imposed at R and, then, after 130
dB, the outage improves due to the availability of the VLC

6With our assumptions and system parameters, it is reasonable to consider
such high SNR values, e.g., 200 dB, which can be easily obtained due to the
corresponding small variances of the noise terms.

link, i.e., the VLC-based SNR starts prevailing over the RF-
based SNR. Such long saturation region can be explained
by extremely small channel coefﬁcients related to the VLC
channel modeling. Moreover, since the VLC communication
link does not interfere with the primary network, the OP
performance starts improving by approaching the ideal case
(i.e., becomes parallel to the line in Case 1 given by a green
dash line) under the assumption that there is no ITC declared
in the network. The second saturation occurs after 160 dB
when the other power constraint at S is activated to prevent
harmful interference at U . Moreover, this second saturation
perfectly matches the approximated outage curve. In Case 2,
the system performance (given by a brown short dash-dot line)
follows the previous outage pattern until it comes to the point
of 150 dB when no second saturation region appears since S is
not restricted by Eq. (1). Consequently, the outage probability
increases and tends to 0. In the next scenario, i.e., Case 3, the
outage performance (presented by a red short dash line) of
the system improves as the transmit SNR increases until the
power constraint at S individually determines an outage event
in the network. On the other hand, Case 4, when S and R do
not interfere with the PN, the outage performance improves
as the transmit SNR increases without any saturation.

Remark Cases 3 and 4 can be treated as the asymptotic
benchmarks useful for investigation of extreme cases of the
considered system model without considering the presence of
the VLC communication link between EVs.

for different values of dRD experience the ﬁrst saturation at
the same transmit SNR value (around 50 dB). However, the
saturation regions related to the different distances between R
and D are not the same due to the corresponding path losses.
At the same time, both curves have the identical levels of the
second saturation region. With this in mind, we note that the
outage reduction gain provided by the proposed system model
is more sufﬁcient as the R-to-D distance becomes bigger when
the ﬁnal outage saturation is determined by the ITC at U .

Next,

in our discussion, we will consider only Case 1
since it represents the most practical and sophisticated network
scenario when both secondary transmitters have the CR-based
power restrictions and we can quantitatively estimate the
impact of the VLC communication.

In Fig. 3, we plot the outage performance for different CSI
scenarios given by σ2
dB and

65 dB. We can notice that the OP curves for the perfect
hL =
CSI scenario always outperform the other CSI scenarios, as
expected. Moreover, it is worthwhile pointing out that the
curves related to the imperfect CSI scenarios (σ2
ǫ = 0.01
and σ2
ǫ = 0.1) follow the same behavior as the perfect CSI
i.e., both the saturation and further performance
scenario,
enhancement occur. However, they do not approach the ideal
case and experience another saturation which is now caused
by the CSI errors. These saturation curves coincide with the
high SNR approximations of the OP performance given by Eq.
(32). The same behavior can be noticed for the case when the
ITC at U is given by IU = 25 dB and the outage improves as
U becomes more robust to the interference level.

In Fig. 2, we also demonstrate the outage performance for
dRD = 20 m, and one can observe a performance gap related
to the different value of dRD. Additionally, we plot the outage
performance of the RF-based CR network mimicking Case 1.
As shown, the corresponding system performance is poor, as
expected. One can notice that, in Case 1, both curves obtained

Next, in Fig. 4, we plot the outage performance versus the
SNR-based data rate threshold v for various CSI scenarios
and different values of K, i.e., 0 dB and 10 dB. As it can
be noticed, the OP curves representing the perfect CSI case
indicate that the system experiences a satisfactory level of
network reliability, and an additional increase in K sufﬁciently

improves the OP performance. On the other hand, the network
reliability severely degrades as the CSI mismatch increases,
and further increase in the LOS-component power (e.g., K =
10 dB) results in slight improvement of the outage metric,
i.e., this effect is less evident as the CSI quality becomes
worse. Finally, we note that the identical CSI cases coincide
with each other which can be explained by the fact that, after
certain threshold (e.g., in our case, it is 4 for ξ = 120 dB),
additional power allocated to the LOS-component (i.e., Rician
fading) does not provide the outage improvement as the power
constraint at S gets activated which, in turn, leads to the
second saturation region (see Fig. 2) due to the DF mode
implemented in the considered system model.

Fig. 6. The reduction of outage versus the transmit SNR for
different CSI scenarios when v = 2 and IU = 25 dB.

Fig. 5 presents the results on the achievable throughput
(normalized per Hz) which is obtained from Eq. (30) for
different values of K and CSI scenarios when IU = 20
dB. It is important to point out that the throughput results
also support the ﬁndings related to Fig. 2 where one can
observe the saturation regions imposed by the CR transmission
which is followed by the performance improvement (e.g.,
signiﬁcant and small enhancements correspond to the perfect
and imperfect CSI scenarios, respectively). All CSI scenarios
in the two-stage saturation and the achievable
also result
throughput is mainly determined by the respective CSI quality.
Note that, as in Fig. 4, the relative increase of the LOS-based
power provides insufﬁcient throughput improvement. Finally,
another useful insight is that the quality of the CSI estimates
has a stronger impact on the outage performance than the
power level received from the LOS path. This can be explained
by the fact that the increased power levels related to higher
K will be directly dispersed with respect to the CSI error
variance into the desired and interference terms in the SNR
expressions. For instance, more power is associated with the
interference term as the CSI quality becomes worse.

Next, in Fig. 6, we demonstrate some results on the re-
duction of outage achievable by the proposed technique for
different values of dRD and K. In order to quantify this
∆out
improvement, we plot the reduction of outage as 10 log10
Pout
(in dB). One can note that the outage reduction for K = 5 dB
occurs earlier than the one corresponding to K = 0 dB. This
is explained by the fact that more power is allocated to the
LOS-component of the VLC channel, however, at 150 dB, both
lines match each other at 150 dB since the power restriction
at S allows further improvement. Next, we consider the other
case when dRD = 20 m (red color), where the system starts
experiencing the outage reduction gain later, around 135 dB.
This happens due to the proximity between R and D nodes.
At the same time, the outage gain is bigger compared to the
previous one. It can also be observed that the reduction of

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outage decreases as the CSI quality degrades. Additionally,
it is worthwhile noting that the imperfect CSI cases can be
characterized by a ﬁxed outage improvement because of the
prevailing impact of the channel estimation errors. Another
meaningful insight is that the higher the curves are depicted
in Fig. 6, the more outage reduction the system achieves.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we investigated the performance of the several
outdoor cognitive electric vehicular network cases over mixed
RF/VLC channels for different CSI scenarios. We derived
novel closed-form expressions for the outage performance
and analyzed their asymptotic behavior. We showed that the
CSI quality effect dominates over the effect of power arrived
from the LOS path. Moreover, we evaluated the achievable
throughput of the system under consideration. Additionally,
we quantiﬁed the outage reduction achieved by means of the
mixed VLC/RF channels. Finally, we demonstrated that the
derived analytical results are in agreement with the Monte
Carlo simulations.

APPENDIX A
A CONVENTIONAL CR-BASED EV NETWORK OVER RF
CHANNELS

In this section, we derive the closed-form expressions
of outage performance for different Cases in the CR-based
vehicular network over RF channels. This implies that the
established communication sessions do not have the advantage
of availability of the VLC communication link between R and
D, i.e., outage performance does not improve when the ITC
at U is reached.

APPENDIX B
OUTAGE REDUCTION

In this section, we present the closed-form expressions of
asymptotic outage reduction for different Cases. As we can
see, in the case of perfect CSI and high SNR, Cases 1 and 2
are advantageous compared to Cases 3 and 4, since the former
ones obtain non-zero outage reduction. This can be explained
by the fact that mixed RF/VLC channel is established between
R and D, and the power restriction imposed at R (i.e., Cases 1
and 2) enables the system to switch the communication session
from the RF band to the VLC one.
