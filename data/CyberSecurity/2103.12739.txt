Abstract

Phishing is one of the most severe cyber-attacks where
researchers are interested to ﬁnd a solution. In phish-
ing, attackers lure end-users and steal their personal in-
formation. To minimize the damage caused by phish-
ing must be detected as early as possible. There are
various phishing attacks like spear phishing, whaling,
vishing, smishing, pharming and so on. There are
various phishing detection techniques based on white-
list, black-list, content-based, URL-based, visual-
similarity and machine-learning. In this paper, we dis-
cuss various kinds of phishing attacks, attack vectors
and detection techniques for detecting the phishing
sites. Performance comparison of 18 different models
along with nine different sources of datasets are given.
Challenges in phishing detection techniques are also
given.

1 Introduction

In recent days cyber-attacks are increasing at an un-
precedented rate. Phishing is one among those cyber-
attacks [55]. In phishing, attackers lure the end-users
by making them click the hyper-links which make
them lose their personally identiﬁable information,
banking and credit card details, and passwords. In this
attack the attackers disguise themselves as trusted en-
tities such as service providers, employees of the or-
ganization or technical-support team from the organi-
zation so that end-users never doubt them. It is mainly
done through emails asking to update the system, or
saying that account has been suspended, or asking to

claim the prize and so on [59]. The main goal of phish-
ing is to make end-users share their sensitive informa-
tion. Now-a-days information regarding anything is
available online and that information is stored in web-
sites. Websites help the end-users by providing them
information about their respective products,services or
helping the end-users if they face any problem by chat-
bots, message forums and so on. Websites also store
the personal information of the end-users. As web-
sites help the end-users in gaining information they
can be used as bait for trapping the end-users to ob-
tain conﬁdential information from them. Websites can
be forged easily with the help of many online tools.
The forged websites look exactly similar to the legit-
imate websites and end-users will not get any doubt
while browsing these sites. The illegitimate websites
must be detected as early as possible to make sure that
there is no loss of information.

1.1 Types of Phishing Attacks

There are different types of Phishing attacks. The main
goal of these attacks are to obtain sensitive information
from the end-users. Figure 1 shows various types of
phishing attacks.

1.1.1 Email Phishing

In this type of phishing an attacker sends an email re-
garding any problem, update or any sensitive matter
that must be changed immediately once the user clicks
the email and all the input the details entered by the
end-users will be redirected to the attacker [56].

harvested [56][58].
Example : Lucky Draw campaign - In this attackers
send SMS to end-users asking them to claim the ac-
count that they have won through lucky draw. Attack-
ers ask them to click the link and provide their infor-
mation so that amount will be transferred to their ac-
counts.

1.1.5 Vishing

It is also known as Voice Phishing. It is a type of phone
fraud that uses voice messages to obtain personal in-
formation or money from victims. Vishing uses auto-
mated voice recordings to lure victims. In Vishing, an
automated voice call stating that the recipients’ bank
account has been compromised is sent. The voice mes-
sage then asks the recipient to call a speciﬁed toll-free
number. Once users call to that toll-free number, the
user’s bank account number and other personal details
are harvested via the phone keypad [56][58].

1.1.6 Pharming

Pharming is sometimes known as “phishing without
a lure”. When a user attempts to navigate to a site,
their computer can determine the IP address by either
consulting a local ﬁle of deﬁned mappings—a hosts
ﬁle—or by consulting a DNS server on the Internet.
Pharming is usually conducted either by changing the
hosts ﬁle on a victim’s computer (hosts ﬁle pharming)
or by exploiting a vulnerability in DNS server software
(DNS poisoning) [60].

1.1.7 Content-injection Phishing

In this, the content of the legitimate website is replaced
with some random content with different input ﬁelds
similar to legitimate site so that end –users trust easily
and give their data easily [60].

1.1.8 Search Engine Phishing

It occurs when phishers create websites with attractive
sounding offers and have them indexed legitimately
with search engines. Users ﬁnd these sites in the nor-
mal course of searching for products or services and
are fooled into giving up their information [60].

Figure 1: Types Of Phishing Attacks

1.1.2 Spear Phishing

In this attackers aims for speciﬁc individuals or enter-
prises, as opposed to random application users. It’s a
more in-depth version of phishing that requires special
knowledge about an organization, including its power
structure. In this attack emails are sent to speciﬁc per-
sons unlike phishing [56].

1.1.3 Whaling

It is known as whaling phishing or a whaling phishing
attack.
It is a form of spear phishing where, in this
phishing attackers target high-proﬁle employees, such
as the CEO or CFO, in order to steal sensitive infor-
mation from a company. As these people hold higher
positions within the company, they will have complete
access to sensitive data. It will be easy to obtain more
information [57].

1.1.4 Smishing

It is also known as SMS phishing. It is a type of so-
cial engineering attack carried out in order to steal user
data including personal information, ﬁnancial infor-
mation, and credentials. Smishing also aims at laun-
dering money from victims. In Smishing, scammers
send phishing messages via an SMS text that includes
a malicious link. The phishing messages trick recip-
ients into clicking the malicious link, which redirects
them to a phishing page where personal information is

1.2 Phishing techniques

1.3 Phishing Websites

There are different techniques used by attackers to ex-
ecute different types of phishing attacks. By using
these techniques the attackers can bypass the security
and are able to obtain conﬁdential information from
the end-users [61].
1. Link Manipulation
2. Website Forgery
3. Pop ups

1.2.1 Link Manipulation

Link manipulation [61] is a widely used technique for
phishing scams. It is done by directing a user through
fraud to click a link to a fake website. Hackers are now
using manipulative ways to get the users to click such
as:
1.Use of sub-domains
2.Hidden URLs
3.Misspelled URLs
4.IDN(internationalized domain name) Homograph
attacks

1.2.2 Website Forgery

Website forgery [61] is another phishing technique that
works by making a malicious website impersonate an
authentic one, so as to make the visitors give up their
sensitive information like account details, passwords,
credit card numbers, etc. Web forgery is mainly car-
ried out in two ways:
1. Cross-site scripting
2. Website spooﬁng.

1.2.3 Pop-up

Pop-up messages are one of the easiest techniques to
conduct successful phishing scams. They allow hack-
ers to steal login details by sending users pop-up mes-
sages and eventually leading them to forged websites
through these pop-ups. A variant of phishing attacks,
also known as “in-session phishing,” works by dis-
playing a pop-up window during an online banking
session and appears to be a message from the bank
[61].

Phishing websites are replicas of legitimate websites.
For phishing websites, entire website is not created,
only the home page or page where user can give
inputs is created so that any information entered is
sent to the attacker. There are many ways to create a
phishing website such as downloading source code of
any particular website, clone the website or use any
speciﬁc tools. In kali-linux there is a tool called SET
(social-engineering toolkit) which is mainly used for
cloning of web-pages [70]. The difference between
the phishing websites and legitimate websites can be
seen in their URLs, content of the websites, logos
seen on the websites, hyperlinks, hosting domains,
domain age, source-code, SSL certiﬁcates [43] etc.
Now-a-days as URLs being too large,they are being
shortened. These are done by URL shorteners [50].
These URLs look different from normal URLs, they
sub-domain,Top-level
don’t contain any domain,
domain(TLD), they just contain protocol and path.
These URLs just redirects to the original URL. In this
method as there is no information regarding about
website, attackers make use of this method and send
this type of URLs to the end-users. End-users doesn’t
pay much attention to URL, they just click the URL
and enter the credentials, in that way they lose their
conﬁdential information. These websites must be
identiﬁed as early as possible to prevent loss of data.

The rest of the paper is organized into different
sections: Section 2 lists various website detection
methods over time, Section 3 describes about different
sources of datasets, comparison between different
models along with their accuracy and different chal-
lenges to be worked on , Section 4 presents challenges
and discussions, and Section 5 presents the conclusion
followed by references.

Phishing Website Detection

Techniques

There are different types of detection techniques for
detecting the phishing sites. Figure 2 shows various
types of phishing detection techniques.

Figure 2: Phishing Website-Detection Techniques

2.1 List based

2.2 Heuristic Oriented Detection

In this method there are two types:
1)Blacklisting
2)White-listing.
These are also known as traditional approaches or
database-oriented approaches. Their response time
and detection accuracy is very high [36][42].

2.1.1 Black-Listing

In this technique, the URL’s which are considered as
phished sites are stored in database so when a new
URL is entered it compares with the URLs in the
database and if it matches it is blocked by the browser
and is stored in the database for future purpose. The
limitation of this technique is that detection of zero-
hour phishing attacks is not possible [42].

2.1.2 White-Listing

In this technique the legitimate URLs are stored in the
database and are used for checking new URLs. In this
technique when a new URL is entered, ﬁrst they check
for that URL in the database, if there is no record of
that URL then the entire information of that URL is
checked such as domain names, age, SSL certiﬁcates,
hyper-links connected to the website and then they are
stored in the database. The drawback in case of white-
listing technique is, are the websites registered as legit-
imate are really legitimate or they present themselves
as legitimate. The limitation of listing techniques is
they require large amount of space [42].

It is extension of listing technique. In this technique,
features of the websites are extracted such as URL’s,
content and they are used for comparison among dif-

are considered as phishing sites. These are better than
listing techniques and their results gives more accu-
racy but their response time is low [5][42][43][12]. A
different approach for detection of zero-hour phishing
attack is discussed in [37].

2.2.1 URL-based

For increasing the speed of the detection, URL based

based features combined with machine learning gives
better accuracy-rate [7][14][35].

2.2.2 Content-based

In this, the content of the websites are compared with
the legitimate websites to determine whether the sites
are legitimate or not [12]. But there are many websites
which doesn’t have much content then this detection
strategy fails . Now-a-days website contents are re-
placed by images [36].

2.3 Visual Similarity

In this technique screenshots of web pages are taken
and are stored in the databases. Then if there are look
alike websites then the screenshots of both the web-
pages are compared to detect if it is phishing website

screenshots of websites. When multiple websites with
same URL appear the ﬁrst one to appear is considered
as legitimate. But there can be any chance that the ﬁrst
to appear can be a phishing site [27][36][42][54].

2.4 Machine learning

Based on different datasets obtained from the differ-
ent features of the websites, machine learning trains
model from those datasets and tests them with dif-
ferent machine learning classiﬁers such as Random
forest classiﬁer, Support vector machine, Decision
Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic regression and so on [32].
These classiﬁers help in predicting the websites even
before they are created, thus machine learning solves
the problem of zero-hour phishing attacks. The classi-
ﬁer’s accuracy varies depending on the size of the data-
set and type of features used [2][26][45][48]. Frame-
works are also developed to detect phishing attacks
[51][53].

2.4.1 Naive-Bayes

Naive Bayes classiﬁer is a generative probabilistic
model in machine learning and is based on the Bayes
theorem. It is mostly used in classiﬁcation areas, such
as text classiﬁcation, spam detection, because of its
simplicity.
Its features are independent among each
other. Detection of websites using lexical analysis of
URL in which Naive Bayes achieved the highest accu-
racy [6][16][52].

2.4.2 Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble classiﬁer used for clas-
siﬁcation and regression. It constructs decision trees
based on randomly selected sets in training samples
and then aggregate decisions from these trees by av-
eraging or majority voting. It improves accuracy and
also reduces over-ﬁtting [4][9][16].

2.4.3 Decision Tree

Decision tree classiﬁers are one of the most popular
classiﬁers used in classiﬁcation and regression. It di-
vides the training data-set until it reaches to a leaf

node, which is a label in classiﬁcation. Decision tree
classiﬁer uses the entire training data-set while con-
structing a tree unlike Random Forest [9][16][52].

2.4.4 Support Vector Machine

Support vector machine can solve linear or non-linear
problems. In linear problems, it simply ﬁnds a hyper-
plane in N-dimensional feature space [52]. Different
versions of support vector machine can also be used
for detection purposes [5][16][53].

2.4.5 K-Nearest Neighbour

KNN is a non-parametric algorithm used in both clas-
siﬁcation and regression.
Its classiﬁcation works on
unknown data closest to k in the training feature space.
Closest points are selected using distance functions
such as Hamming, Euclidian and Minkowski. KNN
works slow if the data size is large [16].

2.4.6 Logistic Regresssion

Logistic regression is a discriminative probabilistic
model mainly used in which the output is binary. Lo-
gistic regression performs better than Naive Bayes
model when training size is close to inﬁnity [16][52].

2.4.7 AdaBoost

AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) works as a conjunction
algorithm because it is used to classify by training dif-
ferent weak learning algorithms to form a strong one
i.e. to improve performance. The output of weak clas-
siﬁers are combined by setting correct weights for ﬁnal
decision. Since AdaBoost is sensitive to outliers and
focuses on hard-to-classify samples, it is less resistant
to overﬁtting [21][46][52].

2.4.8 Artiﬁcal Neural Networks

Artiﬁcial neural networks(ANN) consist of informa-
tion processing elements known to mimic neurons of
the brain.ANN is classiﬁed into two types depending
on the number of layers.they are shallow and deep neu-
ral networks. If the number of layers is two i.e, only
input and output layer then it is shallow neural net-
works. If the neural networks consists of three layers
in which there is at least one hidden layer then it is
deep neural network [11][16][49][69].

2.4.8.1 Deep Neural Network

Deep neural network represents the type of machine
learning when the system uses many layers of nodes
to derive high-level functions from input information.
It means transforming the data into a more creative
and abstract component [25][77]. To detect the prob-
lem of over-ﬁtting, a new method has been proposed
namely, OFS-NN, an effective phishing websites de-
tection model based on the optimal feature selection
method and neural network. The proposed algorithm
is able to alleviate the over-ﬁtting problem of the un-
derlying neural network to a large extent [40].

2.4.8.1.1 Feed-Forward Neural Network

A feed-forward neural network is an artiﬁcial neural
network wherein connections between the nodes do
not form a cycles. In this network, information trav-
els from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if
any) and to the output nodes in just one direction, for-
ward. The network does not have any cycles or loops
[13][71].

2.4.8.1.1.1 Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) belongs to the
family of Artiﬁcial Neural Networks. A CNN is a
deep learning technique that works well for identi-
fying simple patterns in the data which will then be
used to form more complex patterns in subsequent lay-
ers.
It gives high accuracy when compared to other
machine learning classiﬁers [8][10]. PhishingNet, a
deep learning-based approach for timely detection of
phishing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) which
uses CNN as well as RNN to extract the features
[3][17][19][24][27][33][41][52].

supervised learning techniques.
It has multiple lay-
ers of perceptron with a non-linear activation function
rather than a single-layer perceptron; that’s why it is
called multiple layer perceptron. It uses a back propa-
gation algorithm for supervised learning [13][22].

2.4.8.1.3 Recurrent Neural Networks

A class of artiﬁcial neural networks where connections
between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal
sequence is recurrent neural network (RNN). This al-
lows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived
from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their
internal state (memory) to process variable length se-
quences of inputs [15][18][41][72].

2.4.8.1.3.1 Long term Short memory

The artiﬁcial recurrent neural network (RNN) archi-
tecture[1] used in the ﬁeld of deep learning is long
short-term memory (LSTM). LSTM has feedback
links, unlike normal feedforward neural networks. It
can process not only single data points (such as im-
ages), but also entire data sequences, such as speech
or video [15][18][33][52][74].

2.4.8.1.4 Capsule Neural Network

The machine learning system that is a type of artiﬁ-
cial neural network (ANN) that can be used to bet-
ter model hierarchical relationships is Capsule Neural
Network (CapsNet). Add structures to a convolution
neural network (CNN) called "capsules" and to reuse
output from some of those capsules to form more sta-
ble representations for higher capsules is their idea.
The output is a vector consisting of the likelihood of
an observation and a pose for that observation[31][73]

2.4.8.1.1.2 Radial basis Function

Radial Basis Function(RBF) is a type of feed forward
neural network that has been used broadly for classi-
ﬁcation and regression problems because of its sim-
plest architecture and effective results for numerical
data [20].

2.4.8.1.2 Multi-layer perceptron

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a successful model in
the ﬁeld of deep learning. It is a class of feed-forward

2.4.8.1.5 Deep Belief Network

Deep Belief Network(DBN) is a generative graphical
model composed of multiple hidden layers with con-
nection between layers and, there is no connection be-
tween units within each layer. DBN involves two steps
that is, training in unsupervised way and training in
supervised way.
In unsupervised way, DBN learns
to probabilistically reconstruct to input, this layer is
called feature detectors on input. In supervised way,
DBN works as classiﬁer and does classiﬁcation. DBN

extracts the deep hierarchical representation (knowl-
edge) and learns from this knowledge to make best
model [29].

S.No

2.4.8.1.6 Auto-encoder

Auto-Encoder(AE) is an unsupervised deep learning
method. The basic framework of AE comprises an in-
put layer, an output layer, and a hidden layer. Therein,
the input layer and the output layer have the same
structure, and when the input is equal to the output, the
hidden layer represents potential structure and charac-
teristics of the input. The aim of AE is to transform
inputs into outputs with the least possible amount of
deviation [30].

2.4.9 Fuzzy logic

Machine learning detects the sites through feature ex-
traction but what types of features are considered,
does the features considered are enough to detect the
phishing sites and are those features present in all the
sites. These can be known by using Fuzzy rough
set, which is used as a tool to select the most effec-
tive features for detecting phishing websites by using
most commonly used features such as domain based,
address-bar, abnormal-based and HTML/JavaScript
based [23][38][44][47].

3 Datasets & Performance com-

parison

In this section performance comparison of different
models along with different datasets are discussed.
Datasets play an important role in predicting illegiti-
mate websites. In techniques like Machine learning,
deep learning and neural networks: ﬁrst data will be
collected from the different sources,then the collected
data will be used for training the model and then the
model will be used for testing to check whether it
can predict the websites correctly or not. Some of
the common sources of datasets are shown below in

4 Challenges & Discussion

Some of the challenges are collected from the existing
methods to improve their accuracy rate.

1. Reduce False positives
In classiﬁcation problem machine-learning gives a
confusion matrix.
In some classiﬁers, false positive
rates are high i.e, even though the websites are
legitimate the model classiﬁes them as illegitimate
sites, in this way end-users can’t access the real web-
site. If they can be reduced then the end-users can be
able to access the legitimate sites without any problem.

2. Eliminate False negatives
While predicting the accuracy,
the classiﬁers give
false negatives i.e, even though the websites are
illegitimate the model classiﬁes them as legitimate
and this will result in damage, which includes loss of
fame, corruption of systems and so on. These must be
eliminated in order to prevent any harm to end-users
and organisations.

able to predict correctly as the model is unaware of
new phishing attack vectors. Using current datasets is
the solution. When the datasets are small, modelling
time of the classiﬁers is not known as they will be
trained in less time. When datasets differ in size
their modelling time will alter so when we use larger
datasets the modelling time will be known properly.

4. Selection and usage of features
There are many features of a website such as URL,
page, content features, domain features, source-code
and so on which are used for detecting the sites. To
decide what features can be used to train a model
which can give more accuracy in detection is difﬁcult.
When only a single feature is used for detection then
the prediction results may not be accurate. Using of
multiple features of a website give more information
about the site which can help in the detection process.

5. Sensitive words
Use of sensitive words such as mail, bank, SMS and
so on will have impact while predicting the sites. This
may reﬂect in the results.

3. Datasets and their modelling time
Datasets play an important role in training models.
By using old datasets the trained model may not be

6. Embedded objects

8

When a detection technique uses source code of a
website for predicting the sites it extracts all the html
tags but when there are any embedded objects such
as i-frames, ﬂash etc, it may be not able to detect
properly.

7. Overﬁtting
Overﬁtting happens when a model learns the detail
and noise in the training data to the extent that it
negatively impacts the performance of the model on
new data. The problem is that these concepts do not
apply to new data and negatively impact the models
ability to generalize [78].

5 Conclusion

We discussed phishing website detection techniques.
The techniques include list-based, heuristic-based,
visual-similarity and machine-learning. We compared
the performance of different methods with respect to
datasets. Future work includes, ﬁnding solutions for
the challenges, so that any type of phishing sites can
be detected as early as possible.
