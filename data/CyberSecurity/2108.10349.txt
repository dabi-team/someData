Abstract‚ÄîModern  microgrids  are  networked 

systems 
comprising  physical  and  cyber  components  for  networking, 
computation,  and  monitoring.  These  cyber  components  make 
microgrids  more  reliable  but  increase  the  system  complexity. 
Therefore, risk assessment methods are an imperative technology 
for cyber-physical  systems to ensure safe and  secure operations. 
The authors propose a reliability approach that utilizes the failure 
modes of power  and  cyber  network  key  components  to  perform 
the risk analysis in microgrids. In this work, the authors have used 
the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach for risk 
assessment  of  microgrid  systems  and  determine  the  influence  of 
various failure modes on their performance. FMEA is one of the 
most  effective  methods  to  assess  the  risk  involving  the  cyber 
components. It is the method of examining components, modules, 
and subsystems to determine failure modes in a system and their 
causes  and  consequences.  A  novel  approach  is  proposed  to 
calculate  risk  priority  numbers  based  on  factors  like  severity, 
occurrence,  and  detection.  A  risk  matrix  is  calculated  from  the 
proposed  FMEA  worksheet,  which  acts  as  a  graphical 
representation  for  evaluating  components  risk  based  on  risk 
priority number or criticality metrics.

I.  INTRODUCTION  

The Department  of  Energy defines  a  microgrid  (MG) as  a 
group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources 
within clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single 
controllable entity with respect to the grid. An MG can connect 
and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid-
connected or island- mode [1]. Distributed generators in MG are 
renewable  in  nature.  The  intermittent  nature  of  renewable 
energy sources is challenging as it can cause power fluctuations 
over  multiple  time  horizons  forcing  the  MG  and  utility  grid 
operators to change the real-time operating procedures. Failure 
of the component or subsystem in the MG can lead to a cascade 
of failures and, in extreme cases, lead to a blackout. 

Modern  MGs  use  an  array  of  complex  digital 
communications technologies for a variety of operational uses 
and  data  measurements.  Unfortunately,  these  cyber-physical 
components  of  the  MG  are  prone  to  cyberattacks  which  can 
disable,  damage,  manipulate  or  steal  the  data  from  MG 
operators.  

When such a fragile system is involved, there is a necessity 
for  reliability  quantification  using  relevant  methodology  and 

tools. To detect and eradicate the potential failures, the system 
must be analyzed at the component level, thereby improving the 
revenue and operational life of the components. The authors of 
this work have performed a comprehensive reliability analysis 
for  MG  in  grid-tied  mode  [2]  using  fault  tree  analysis  then 
calculated time-based metrics and importance measures which 
will  further  increase  the  reliability  of  the  MG.  In  [2],  cyber 
components are not included as a part of the reliability analysis 
as cyberattacks are not time-based failures. To address this issue 
and as a part of the reliability-centered maintenance evaluation 
for  the  MG,  authors  have  used  the  FMEA  to  identify  the 
potential cyber-attacks and their causes and effects on the MG.  

This paper serves the following objectives: a. To present a 
systematic  methodology  of  FMEA  application  for  cyber-
physical components in the MG environment and to demonstrate 
the applicability of this technique to this system, b. Present the 
results in the form of an FMEA report and criticality matrix to 
evaluate the risk level.  

The following section presents a brief introduction to FMEA 
and a review of the applications of FMEA in MG and smart grids 
environments.  This  is  followed  by  a  FMEA  analysis  of  MG's 
cyber-physical components, results, and conclusions and future 
work. 

II.  FAILURE MODES AND EFFECTIVE ANALYSIS (FMEA) 

A.  Main concept 

The  primary  goal  of  FMEA  is  to  identify  possible  failure 
modes,  analyze  the  causes  and  effects  of  various  component 
failure  modes  and  decide  what  may  be  done  to  prevent  or 
decrease the likelihood of high-risk failures. The study's findings 
can  assist  risk  analysts  in  identifying  and  correcting  failure 
modes that negatively impact the system's performance during 
the design and development stages. 

Criticality analysis in FMEA is performed using three risk 
factors, namely severity (S), occurrence (O), and detection (D). 
Using  these  three  factors,  a  risk  priority  number  (RPN)  to 
prioritize the failure modes is computed as follows: 

ùëÖùëÉùëÅ = ùëÜ ‚àó ùëÇ ‚àó ùê∑ 

Each of the three factors is rated on a scale ranging from 1 
to  10.    A  typical  ranking  system  for  the  three  risk  factors  is 
provided 
the  risk  for 
tables  I-III  [3].  The  greater 
product/system reliability, the higher the RPN of a failure mode. 
The failure modes will be ranked based on the RPN scores, and 

in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appropriate  remedial/mitigation  actions  should  be 
sequentially from the high-risk to low-risk failure modes.

  While FMEA is an effective method to perform risk analysis 
and preventive management, there are some drawbacks: 

ÔÇ∑  Risk  factors  S,  O,  and  D  are  treated  with  the  same 
weight while omitting their relative importance. 

ÔÇ∑  Different combinations of S, O, and D can produce the 
exact value of RPN. This could result in ignoring some 
high-risk failure modes. 

ÔÇ∑  Classical FMEA only considers risk factors regarding 
safety, ignoring critical factors like economic impacts. 

B.  Procedure 
  A methodical approach should be followed to carry out an 
FMEA  effectively.  The  general  technique  for  performing  a 
classical  FMEA  can  be  broken  down  into  numerous  steps  as 
shown in Fig. 1.

C.  Literature review 

FMEA  has  been  proven  to  be  a  popular  risk  analysis 
technique  and  is  multidisciplinary.  Some  work  went  into 
applying  FMEA  for  cybersecurity.  In  [4]  FMEA  is  used  for 
assessing the likelihood of cybersecurity risks in manufacturing 
systems. Arben Asllani et al. [5] employs cybersecurity FMEA 
(C-FMEA) to show how failures of critical cyber components 
can affect the performance of the system by studying a regional 
airport  as  an  example.  The  only  work  published  for  the 
application  of  FMEA  in  the  context  of  smart  grid  cyber-
physical systems is presented in [6]  where  failure modes and 
their effects on power and cyber components are discussed. In 
[6] a single FMEA risk analysis is performed for both cyber and 
power components, while for an in-depth and efficient analysis, 
they must be studied separately. To address this issue, authors 
of the present work are proposing an in-depth FMEA analysis 
considering only MG cyber components.  

Following are some of the popular applications of FMEA in 

renewable energy sources.

using cost sensitivity analysis is proposed in [10]. 

III.  FMEA ANALYSIS FOR MG CYBER-PHYSICAL COMPONENTS  

A.  Description of cyber components in MG 

The  safe  and  stable  operation  of  MG  requires  the 
coordination of its cyber systems. The physical part of the MG 
contains  distributed  generators,  primarily  renewable  energy 
sources,  battery  energy  storage  systems,  loads,  and  other 
equipment.  The  cyber  part  contains  data  acquisition  devices, 
controllers,  state  detectors,  communication  devices,  and  other 
equipment.  

In  [11]  MG,  a  cybersecurity  architecture  is  proposed  to 
mitigate  potential  cyberattacks,  and  all  the  typical  cyber 
components  are  listed.  The  list  of  cyber-physical  components 
used  in  this  study  and  their  role  in  MG  communication 
infrastructure  is  as  follows    :  Energy  management  systems 
(EMS) to optimize MG operations, to transmit and receive data 
from  physical  equipment,  server  for  storing  MG  operational 
data, Human-machine interface (HMI) for interaction with MG 
operators, intelligent electronic devices (IED) for sending data 
from relays, controllers to EMS, protection relays, generator and 
renewable energy controller for monitoring the controller data, 
load  controller  for  sending  load  data  to  EMS,  smart  meter  to 
collect data about energy transfer to and from the MG, remote 
terminal units (RTU) for transmitting field devices data to EMS, 
phasor  measurement  units  (PMU)  to  transmit  phasor  data  to 
EMS,  battery  energy  storage  controller  for  transmitting  and 
receiving data from EMS to improve the power quality and to 
optimize the charging and discharging schedules, plug-in hybrid 
electric  vehicle  (PHEV)  to  interact  with  charging  station,  and 
software  updates,  and  PHEV  supply  equipment  to  send 
charging/discharging  information  from  charging  station  to 
EMS.  

B.  Identifying potential failure modes for MG cyber 

components 
Potential failure modes considered in this work are typical 
cyberattacks. A cyberattack is an attempt to gain unauthorized 
access to a system with an intent to damage, disable, or stealing 
the data. An overview of different types of cyber-attacks used 
in this work and their definitions are provided in [12] and [13]. 
Guneet et al. [14] documented different types of hacking and 
reasons to hack, data breaches and reasons for them, malicious 
attacks, outsider attacks, website vulnerabilities, different types 
of malware attacks, and the necessity for cyber laws. Authors 
in  [11]  documented  vulnerabilities  in  internet  protocol  and 
industrial control systems networks.  

Authors  of    the  present  work  have  documented  different 
cyber-attacks from literature and used them in FMEA analysis.    

C.  FMEA analysis and results 
  Using  the  MG  cyber  components  and  different  types  of 
cyber-attacks associated with the previous sections, a complete 
FMEA  analysis  for  MG  cyber-physical  components  was 
performed,  and  results  are  documented.  Not  only  did  authors 
perform  a  classical  FMEA  analysis,  but  they  have  also 

 
 
documented  prevention  controls,  detection  controls,  and 
classification (based on RPN score) for each cyber component.  

  A  risk  matrix  provides  a  visual  way  for  MG  operators  to 
assess risk based on the RPN rating. Figs. 2 and 3 provide the 

  Ratings for risk factors  are assigned according to  standard 
FMEA evaluator's criteria. However, it is to be noted that risk 
factor ratings depend on the events that trigger them. In general, 
various Detection and Occurrence ratings are predicted for each 
failure  mode,  depending  on  the  circumstances  that  prompted 
them, but the Severity rating for each failure mode is distinctive. 
In some cases, this can lead to different RPN ratings for the same 
failure mode. In this study, a total of fifteen cyber components 
with high-risk failure modes are identified and analyzed.  

  Due to the page restriction, authors are only able to include 
the  complete  FMEA  report  for  top  three  critical  components 
with highest RPN in Table V. For the rest of components risk 
factor scores, RPN rating, and classification are documented in 
Table IV. Detailed information and  results from  this work are 
directly available from the authors and will be included in other 
future works.

It is necessary to account for some information loss during 
a  traditional  FMEA  procedure  to  obtain  FMEA  results.  As  a 
consequence, essential findings about high-risk failure modes 
and  their  impact  on  system  reliability  may  be  jeopardized 
because  of  this  predicament.  This  FMEA  analysis  coincides 
with the results in [6], proving the effectiveness of the proposed 
method.

IV.   CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 

This paper discusses the most critical failure modes for the 
cyber-physical  components  and  analyzes  the  application  of 
classical FMEA in the MG environment. First, the results of a 
qualitative reliability study were completed along with a critical 
review  of  FMEA  outcomes.  Once  the  failure  modes  are 
identified, FMEA analysis was conducted, and an FMEA report 
was  generated. This  analysis will  help  the  MG  operators  and 
designers  to  identify  the  weak  points  in  cyber  systems 
infrastructure. The proposed FMEA analysis has the potential 
to  improve  the  reliability  of  the  MG  cyber-physical  system, 
where reliability plays a crucial role in cost-effectiveness.  

Future  research  in  FMEA  for  cyber-physical  components 
and  MG  physical  components  holds  a  lot  of  promise.  To 
address gaps in this study, authors will include  the economic 
risk  assessment  of  the  MG  components,  and  FMEA  analysis 
will be expanded to MG physical components. Also, calculated 
RPN  will  be  compared  with  field  reliability  data,  and 
similarities among them will be documented.  

In  classical  FMEA,  for  RPN  calculation,  the  degree  of 
importance  for  risk  factors  is  not  considered.  To  address  this 
issue, fuzzy-FMEA will be used in future work.
