Abstract 

In  recent  years,  Information  Security  has  become  a  notable  issue  in  the  energy  sector.  After  the  invention  of 
‘The Stuxnet worm’ [1] in 2010, data integrity, privacy and confidentiality has received significant importance 
in the real-time operation of the control centres. New methods and frameworks are being developed to protect 
the National Critical Infrastructures like- energy sector. In the recent literatures, it has been shown that the key 
real-time operational tools (e.g., State Estimator) of any Energy Management System (EMS) are vulnerable to 
Cyber  Attacks.  In  this  chapter,  one  such  cyber  attack  named  ‘False  Data  Injection  Attack’  is  discussed.  A 
literature  review  with  a  case  study  is  considered  to  explain  the  characteristics  and  significance  of  such  data 
integrity attacks.

17.1.  Introduction 

Power  system  State  Estimation  has  been  widely  used  at  the  utility  control  centres  to  know  the  system  status 
during the power system operation. In order to ensure the stability and reliability of the power system, network 
operator  monitors  and  controls  the  system  states  which  are  obtained  from  the  state  estimation  processor. 
Generally, State Estimator provides an estimation of the data for all measured and unmeasured quantities. This 
advanced tool also filters out the measurement errors and noises and suppresses bad data. With the development 
of  the  power  system  research  and  engineering,  the  modern  State  Estimation  programs  have  advanced 
capabilities  which  have  enhanced  the  computational  performances,  as  well  as,  accuracy.  However,  the 
challenges of accurate and efficient State Estimation programs have increased more because of the recent cyber 
attacks in the energy system infrastructure.  

In  a  recent  report  of  the  ‘Industrial  Control  Systems  Cyber  Emergency  Response  Team  (ICS-CERT)’,  it  has 
been  mentioned  that  198  cyber  incidents  happened  in  the  financial  year  2012  among  which  41%  happened 
within ‘Energy sector’. In the first half of the financial year 2013, 200 incidents happened across all sectors of 
the critical infrastructure among which the highest attack (111 in incidents) happened in the energy sector (53%) 
as shown in Fig.17.1 [2].  

From the last few years, distributed energy resources and storage devices are widely used which have changed 
the power flow patterns of the grid [3]. These renewable sources have intermittent nature and most of the time 
they are not dispatchable. Therefore, demand response has been a crucial issue in a smart grid environment. To 
face the challenges, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI) which is equipped with smart meters, may play a 
significant role. It is obvious that the use of smart meters and advanced communication network has helped the 
utility  operators  to  implement  the  SCADA  controls  more  easily;  however,  the  communication  system  of  the 
cyber-physical  smart  grid  has  been  more  vulnerable  in  terms  of  cyber  attack  which  may  affect  the 
communication  network.  These  types  of  cyber  related  crimes  may  have  devastating  impact  on  the  physical 
power grid including operational failures and loss of synchronization of different critical equipments of a power 
grid. Moreover, a large scale blackout may occur due to a cyber attack in a smart grid.

Fig.17.1: Cyber Incidents in Different Sector [2] 

In  a  smart  grid  environment,  energy  system  control  sector  needs  advanced  communication  means  among 
different parts of the network which increases the use of commercial o
-the-shelf technologies. As a result, the 
cyber  security  issues  arise.  State  Estimator,  which  is  one  key  operational  tool  in  the  Energy  Management 
System, is also very vulnerable to cyber attacks. Due to any pre-planned cyber attack in any State Estimation 
programs, bad data detectors may not be able to identify the possible threats which are attacked by any intruder. 
As  a  result,  State  Estimation  programs  will  provide  wrong  information  to  the  system  operator.  Based  on  the 
wrong  estimation,  operator  may  take  misleading  operational  decision  resulting  a  vital  problem  in  the  stable 
operation of power system. Therefore, advanced intrusion detection algorithms are desirable.

The organization of this chapter is as follows: A brief overview of traditional State Estimation is discussed in 
Section 17.2. The problem  formulation  with  solution  methodologies including Bad Data Detection techniques 
are  also  discussed  in  that  section.  The  overview  of  Sate  Estimation  in  Distribution  System  and  Smart  Grid  is 
discussed in Section 17.3 and 17.4 respectively. A case study is illustrated to describe the vulnerabilities of the 
Smart Grid State Estimation in Section 17.5. A recent review on False Data Injection attack on State Estimator 
is discussed in Section 17.6. Finally, the chapter is concluded with brief remarks. This chapter intends to be a 
comprehensive reference in the field of cyber security of smart grid infrastructure. 

17.2.  Power System State Estimation 

 State Estimation is one of the most traditional power system analysis tools for reliable monitoring and control 
of  Energy  Management  System.  One  early  revolutionary  work  based  on  power  system  static  state  estimation 
was proposed in [4] and till then a significant number of research works have been conducted on this imperative 
issue.  Although  the  traditional  State  Estimation  has  a  long  history  in  power  transmission  level,  this  powerful 
network analysis tool needs more attention in the low-voltage power distribution level [5], especially, when the 
grid adopts  more communication infrastructures (i.e., Advanced Metering Infrastructure, Phasor Measurement 
Units, etc.) and Distributed Energy  Resources (DERs).  As  mentioned earlier,  the evolution of the Smart Grid 
State Estimation and the vulnerabilities of this estimation tool in terms of Data Integrity Attack will be discussed 
in the  following section; this  section  will provide a brief overview of the significance of the traditional Static 
State Estimation and different methodologies and techniques involved with it. In this section, the importance of 
Bad Data identification and well-established procedures of detecting bad data are also discussed. 

Basically,  State  Estimation  is  a  procedure  which  is  used  to  determine  the  most  approximate  solution  of  the 
system states by analyzing  the  measured sensor values and the equivalent calculated  values. In power system 
theories and applications, the term ‘state estimator’ implies a computer program for calculating the system states 
based  on  the  measured  data  at  different  nodes  of  the  network  and  the  laws  of  electric  power  networks  which 
explains  the  behavior  of  the  physical  network  model.  The  purpose  of  the  state  estimation  is  to  estimate  the 
unmeasured variables, improve overall efficiency and to detect the bad measurement. 

Generally, the states in a power system are the complex voltage  magnitude and the angles of each bus. If the 
state vector is x, then the state vector for an ‘n’ bus system will be:  

         (17.1) 

(cid:14)
(cid:2) = [	δ(cid:7)	δ(cid:8) 	… … δ(cid:10)		V(cid:12)	V(cid:7)V(cid:8) … … V(cid:10)]

V(cid:15)

δ(cid:15)

  indicates the phase angles and 

 the voltage magnitude at the i-th bus. It is interesting to note that, 
where, 
the dimension of the state vector is (2n-1)×1  as the phase angle at the reference bus is considered to be known 
which is generally assumed 0 rad. Although, the bus voltage magnitudes and angles are used in practice, current 
magnitudes-angles and power flows are also considered as state variables in some cases.  At the first stage of the 
state estimation, measurement data are obtained from the Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) which are equipped 
with sensors. These measurements include voltage magnitudes, bus injections and both real and reactive power 
flows  through  different  components  of  the  network.  However,  the  measurement  data  may  be  noisy  and 
corrupted which increase the risk of direct use of these data. If the system states are known, then it is expected 
that from the laws of electric network (say, Kirchhoff's Current Law or Kirchhoff's Voltage Law) it is possible 
to calculate the power flow pattern of the network. However, it is not possible to directly measure the system 
states which motivate to develop and improve the methodologies related to State Estimations. As a result, at the 
second  stage  of  state  estimation,  functions  of  state  variables  are  used  to  calculate  the  expected  values  of  the 
measurement  data.  Finally,  any  established  method  is  employed  to  calculate  the  state  variables  from  the 
measurement  values  and  the  calculated  values.  One  such  widely  adopted  method  is  Weighted  Least  Square 
(WLS) Method. After estimating the system states, the Bad Data Detection program is perform to identify the 
corrupted data. All of the steps of the state estimation are described briefly in following sub sections. 

17.2.1. System Model of Measurement Data  

Consider  a  measurement  vector  z  for  an  n-bus  system,  where,   
should be:

Therefore, z can be written as:

17.2.3.  State Estimation: Formulation and Methodologies 

As discussed, state estimation depends on the following equation, 

                                                     (17.8)

Therefore,  state  estimation  can  be  formulated  as  an  error  minimization  problem  which  is  in  fact  a  convex 
optimization problem described below: 

, an iterative approach 
where, W is the weighting matrix which can represents  
may  be  adopted.  Some  popular  techniques  are  Gauss-Newton  method  and  Newton-Raphson  method  [8]. 
Evolutionary  algorithm,  i.e.,  swarm  intelligence  based  approaches  (Particle  Swarm  Optimization)  have  also 
been used to solve this critical operational problem [9].

17.2.4.  Bad Data Detection 

Generally, it is assumed that the measured data will contain some errors. However, sometimes, measured data is 
so  faulty  that  it  affects  the  state  estimation  and  inconsistent  result  occurs.  As  a  result,  Bad  Data  Detection 
becomes very important to obtain a successful state estimation. Different methodologies are used to detect and 
identify bad data. Such a widely adopted procedure is ‘Largest Normalized Residual (LNR)’ method [10]. Once 
the system states (

) are estimated, then the residual is calculated as following  

x′

At least one bad data exists if the value of the residual is less than a predefined threshold, which can be written 
as follows: 

h = (cid:30) − 1(2′)

17.3.   State Estimation for Distribution Networks 

State  Estimation  of  transmission  system  is  a  well-established  area  for  real-time  monitoring  and  control  of  a 
complex  power  network.  However,  traditional  techniques  and  methodologies  for  transmission  style  State 
Estimation do not  fit  for a low  voltage power distribution  network.  Generally, balanced approximation of the 
power system is considered in most of the traditional State Estimation techniques, e.g., [6], [8]. Although this 
assumption of positive sequence network modeling is valid for high voltage transmission network, but does not 
work  well  for  low  voltage  distribution  system  [11].  In  reality,  power  lines  are  transposed  and  loads  are  not 
balanced in a distribution network. Moreover, there are three, two, and single-phase lines and transformers are 
both  delta  and  wye  connected.  As  a  result,  rather  than  a  positive  sequence  modeling  of  the  network,  it  is 
essential to have full multi-phase modeling for accurate simulation of distribution network as mentioned in [12]. 
Considering  a-b-c  phase  modeling,  some  early  researches  on  Distribution  State  Estimation  are  proposed  in 
[11],[13-14] where these issues are clearly pointed out. Other than this multi-phase property and untransposed 
phase conductors, distribution network exhibits some other characteristics as below [15], [35]:  

a)  Feeders are mostly radial in nature 
b)  Distributed loads with a small geographical area 
c)  High R/X ratio 
d)  Presence of Distributed Generation and no conventional generation 
e)  Very low redundancy of measurement units 

Due to the distinct features of radial low voltage distribution feeders, Distribution State Estimation is different 
from  the  traditional  one.  Moreover,  analysis  procedure  of  this  real-time  operational  tool  is  very  challenging 
because of the following properties [16]: 

a)  Limitation of measurement devices 
b)  The  pseudo-measurement  of  load  data  is  obtained  from  the  historical  load  data  which  may  have  very 

limited accuracy 

c)  Significant number of current measurement devices are used   
These challenges are increased a lot in a smart grid environment which will be discussed in the next section. 

 
 
 
 
 
17.4.  Smart Grid State Estimation 

Smart Grid State Estimation needs to face the new requirements and challenges of the future renewable energy 
based sustainable self-healing intelligent smarter grid. Different new aspects will have significant impact on the 
Smart  Grid  State  Estimation.  Three  major  aspects  have  been  identified  in  [5]  which  will  be  discussed  here 
briefly: 

a)  Development  of  Advanced  Measurement  Technologies:  Generally,  measurement  data  of  a  power 
system  is  obtained  through  the  SCADA  network.  Traditionally,  Remote  Terminal  Units  (RTUs)  are 
used  for  this  purpose.  RTU  is  a microprocessor-controlled  electronic  device that  is  responsible  to 
measure  network  traffic  through  sensors  and  to  transmit  the  telemetry data  to  the  Distribution 
Management  System  for  further  processing.  These  measurements  are  non-synchronized  and  obtained 
too  infrequently  to  understand  the  system  operational  characteristics.  Especially  capturing  system 
dynamics  is  too  difficult  [5]. In  recent  years,  Phasor  Measurement  Units  (PMUs)  have  been  adopted 
widely for better real-time monitoring and control of smart grid. PMUs have several advantages over 
traditional measurement devices, such as: 

It captures data more frequently, e.g., 20~60 times per second [16]. 

- 
-  Measurement data are synchronized as they are sampled according to the Global Positioning System 

(GPS). 

-  Current measurement is also possible to those nodes where PMU is placed 
b)  New  regulatory  and  pricing  issues:  In  a  Smart  Grid  concept,  new  regulatory  issues  are  arising.  In  a 
consumer-centric electricity  market, end users are capable to produce electricity and sell those to the 
Distribution Network  Operator (DNO). There arises the  need of dynamic pricing and new regulatory 
issues. As a result, DNO must have a clear knowledge about the whole distribution network, especially 
regarding the power flows through all the phases of the utility distribution grid. To obtain an accurate 
power flows, the role of Smart Grid State Estimation is vital.      

c)  Demand response and Distributed Energy Resources: In order to fulfil the ever growing load demand, 
co-generation,  distributed  generation  and  storages  are  being  employed  in  the  grid.  These  devices  are 
making the grid active from its traditional passive manner which will introduce a bi-directional power 
flow [17]. In order to understand the flow pattern, distribution network needs advanced modelling and 
analysis capabilities which motives to develop advanced State Estimation tools for Smart Grid.  

Realizing  the  needs  for  developing  accurate  and  fast  State  Estimation  algorithms,  a  significant  number  of 
research works are going on throughout the world [18-23]. A multi-level State Estimation framework for Smart 
Grid  is  proposed  in  [18]  where  authors  propose  a  new  paradigm  based  on  multi-level  communication  and 
computation  architecture.  At  the  lowest  level,  a  local  State  Estimation  (LSE)  is  proposed  to  deal  with  the 
distribution substation and its downstream radial feeders.  Computed state  variable  values are then transmitted 
through  the  aid  of  communication  infrastructure  to  its  upper  level  which  is  Transmission  System  Operator 
(TSO) level. Rather than calculating only from ‘raw’ data, this time TSO-level SE will get a chance to update, 
smooth  and  modify  the  data  from  LSE  by  comparing  with  the  raw  measurement  data.  At  the  final  stage, 
Regional State Estimation (RSE) will synchronize and purify the data obtained from TSO level SE. Numerical 
simulation is also carried out to explain and evaluate the working procedure of this multi-level schema in [18].        

Signal Processing based approaches have also been used to solve this critical real-time operating problem. One 
such  method  is  Belief  Propagation  based  method  to  solve  Distribution  State  Estimation  [19].  One  major 
challenge of Distribution State Estimation is limited measurement devices.  The method proposed in [19] solves 
the problem of sparse  measurement by addressing Belief Propagation based method for real-time Distribution 
State  Estimation.  One  more  advantage  of  this  method  is  that  it  can  deal  with  the  renewable  energy  based 
distributed power generation  sources. The performance of  the proposed method is compared with the Electric 
Power Research Institute’s distribution system analysis tool openDSS.   

In [20], authors propose a method for Distribution State Estimation  with the deployment of PMUs and Smart 
Meters.  Authors  suggest  that  rather  than  mixing  the  traditional  meter  measurements  and  the  measurements 
obtained  from  Advanced  Metering  Infrastructure  (AMI)  and  PMU,  a  two-step  approach  can  be  adopted.  The 
advantage  is  that  the  current  configurations  of  EMS  software  need  not  to  be  changed.  According  to  that,  a 
traditional  State  Estimation  is  performed  at  the  first  step  and  finally  PMU  measurements  are  considered  to 
update and modify the pre-processing data.  

 
 
Considering  renewable  energy  resources,  a  method  for  State  Estimation  based  on  evolutionary  algorithm  is 
proposed  in  [24].  The  proposed  method  can  consider  different  practical  issues  including  unbalanced  power 
flows, VAR compensators, Voltage Regulators (VRs), tap changing transformers, etc.  

17.5.  Vulnerabilities of Smart Grid Sate Estimation: A Case study 

Recent literature shows that a significant improvement of Smart Grid State Estimation is noticeable in terms of 
‘accuracy’ and ‘efficiency’. However, this operational tool is very prone to cyber vulnerabilities as discussed in 
[25]. As the State Estimation is highly dependent on the measurement data, any intruder can inject ‘False Data’ 
in such a way that the system is unable to detect it. Fig.17.2 shows such kind of scenario when State Estimation 
is  under  attack.  This  type  of  malicious  modification  of  measurement  data  is  known  as  ‘False  Data  Injection 
Attack’  [25]  or  ‘Data  Integrity  Attack’  [31].  In  the  following  sub-section,  a  step-by-step  procedure  of  a  false 
data injection attack is explained with example.

In terms of computational complexity, simplified DC approximation of a power network has more advantages 
over AC model of a power system. Instead of solving ‘N’ nonlinear equations, one need to solve a set of linear 
equations in DC approximation where the bus voltage is considered to be known and equivalent to 1 pu. As DC 
approximation does not need any iterative method, it is faster and reduces the computational burden in the State 
Estimation process. 

For a DC State Estimation, the problem can be defined as: 

                                               (17.11) 

where, z is the vector of measurement data and 
the meter error follows normal distribution with zero mean, the solution becomes as follows [25]:

This value is very close to zero and it can be said that a good assumption of the state variables are made. 

Now,  an  attack  scenario  is  introduced.  It  has  been  assumed  that  the  measurement  data  is  corrupted  by  the 
malicious modification of the measured data and therefore 
 is the attack 
vector. Here,

Scenario 1: This is the base case where no malicious modification of the measured data is made and therefore, it 
is assumed that the residual lies  within the threshold and there is  no probability of a False alarm. In the base 
case, the values of the measured data are PBase-12=0.62 pu , PBase-13=0.06 pu, PBase-32=0.37 pu.  

Scenario 2: In this scenario, measured data are modified arbitrarily. Say, the corrupted measurements are PFalse1-
12=0.63 pu, PFalse1-13=0.05 pu, PFalse1-32=0.35 pu.  

Scenario  3:  In  this  scenario,  measured  data  are  modified  following  the  Attack  Definition  proposed  in  [25]. 
Considering 

 as a vector of non-zero arbitrary chosen values of length n: 

Ž

Ž = (Ž(cid:12), … , ŽP)
Then, the attack vector

Scenario  4:  The  attack  formulation  in  this  scenario  is  the  same  as  it  is  discussed  in  the  previous  scenario, 
however, the value of c is different which is

Therefore,

Now, the results obtained from the previous scenarios are discussed. The base case is already discussed in the 
previous  section.  According  to  that,  the  state  variables  obtained  in  the  base  case  are

.  Using  these  values,  the  squared  error  becomes,

process.

Using these values, the squared error becomes,

the base case. As a result, the False Data Injection attack may not be overlooked and be detected in the Bad Data 
Detection test. So, the intruder may not be successful to plan an attack.  

(cid:7)
i|(cid:30) − o2′|i

At  this  stage  of  the  discussion,  Scenario  3  and  Scenario  4  are  considered  where  measurement  data  are  also 
corrupted like the Scenario 2 but the attack vectors are created following the method described in [25]. Using 
those  corrupted  data  State  Estimation  is  performed  and  the  obtained  state  variables  are  as  follows: 

and

So, the squared error for both the case is

i|(cid:30) − o2′|i

In  scenario  3  and  scenario  4,  the  three  measurement  devices  show  different  measurement  data  as  they  are 
attacked by the intruder and therefore, the system operator obtains two different set of state variables for these 
two different scenarios. But it is interesting to note that the residual values and squared errors calculated from 
both of these scenarios are the same and that is equal to the base case. Therefore, it is expected that the error 
value is below  than the threshold and it  will pass the Bad Data Detection technique although attack has been 
launched.  So, the results can be summarized as follows:

From  the  Table  17.1,  it  can  be  seen  that  no  bad  data  is  detected  in  Scenario  1,  Scenario  3  and  Scenario  4. 
Although  there  is  no  False  Data  Injection  attack  in  Scenario  1  but  measurement  data  is  manipulated  in  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
remaining two scenarios. However, bad data detection technique fails to detect that. It is also interesting to note 
that squared error term for the above discussed cases is 0.00021429 but state variables vary a lot. As a result, the 
system operator may take misleading decisions. 

17.6.  Vulnerabilities of Smart Grid State Estimation: A Review 

The new class of False Data Injection attack is first proposed in [25]. In that literature, authors show that the DC 
State Estimation is very vulnerable to malicious modification of the measurement data. With theorem and proof, 
some  heuristic  approaches  are  proposed  to  attack  the  DC  state  estimation.  Both  random  attacks  and  targeted 
attacks are considered. Two limitations of the proposed methodology are:  

(1) The attacker needs the system ‘Configuration’ information prior to the attack, 

(2) The proposed methodology is developed only for DC State Estimation. 

A technique to detect false data injection is proposed in [26], where authors have focused on detecting a set of 
sensors  whose  measurements  need  to  be  protected  in  order  to  capture  the  false  data  injection  in  a  DC  State 
Estimator. The work presented in that paper considers the proposed attack model of [25]. The relation between 
the change of topology and the attack scenario is not considered in this research work [26].  

The impact of False Data injection attack on the energy market is discussed in [27] which show that a successful 
attack can introduce a financial disaster. In that research, a convex optimization problem is formulated to find 
profitable attack. Although False Data Injection Attack is discussed based on financial issues, the work does not 
provide any intrusion detection or prevention technique to mitigate the problem.    

A protection strategy against  the False Data Injection Attack is proposed in [28]. In this research, the authors 
propose  an  effective  algorithm  to  identify  and  protect  the  key  measurements  easily.  A  strategic  plan  for 
placement  of  PMU  units  is  also  described  here.  This  work  focuses  system  operator’s  point  of  view  to  utilize 
limited  resources  against  the  False  Data  Injection  Attack.  However,  this  paper  does  not  consider  accurate 
nonlinear AC State Estimation to define and protect attacks in power grid.      

Generally,  the  bad  data  detection  technique  relies  on  the  residual  errors  of  the  State  Estimation  procedure. 
However, it has been proven that this type of methodology for Bad Data Detection is vulnerable to False Data 
Injection  Attacks  [25].  To  detect  bad  data,  a  Generalized  Likelihood  Ratio  Test  (GLRT)  is  proposed  in  [29]. 
This paper also considers the False Data Injection Attack from an intruder’s point of view where attacker knows 
the information of mean-square error and GLRT of the system operator. This paper also limits the research idea 
to DC State Estimation. 

Impact of cyber attack on the State Estimation considering a non-linear model is analyzed in [30]. Two widely 
used  Bad  Data  Detection  techniques  are  considered  for  comparision.  This  work  concludes  that  False  Data 
Injection Attack has a better probability to remain undetected if the attacker has a more accurate model of the 
system. 

Another  defense  strategy  against  False  Data  Injection  attack  is  proposed  in  [32].  The  proposed  detection 
framework has two stages. At the first stage, a linear unknown parameter solver is used and finally, a CUSUM 
algorithm is used to detect the intrusion maintain a certain low level of detection error rate. 

Vulnerabilities of AC State Estimation due to the False Data Injection Attack are discussed in [33]. This work 
extends  the  hidden  False  Data  Injection  Attack  model  of  [25]  from  a  DC  approximation  to  a  non-linear  AC 
model.  Here,  authors  propose  a  Graph-theory  based  approach  to  determine  critical  measurement  components 
which are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. 

From the literature review, some decisions may be taken: 

(cid:1)  From the attacker’s point of view: 

a) Detail system model should be considered during the attack creation 

b) Different techniques exist to detect the Bad Data. It is important to note that attack vectors should be able to 
hide against most of the Bad Data Detection techniques. 

c) Attack should be introduced with limited knowledge of system and resources. 

 
(cid:1)  From the system operator’s point of view: 

a) System operator should be aware about the possible attack scenarios. 

b) Strategic protection and defense model should be introduced. 

A brief description of different types of cyber attacks considering smart grid is given in [36].   

17.7. Concluding Remarks 

The role of State Estimation  is crucial to operate the system in a stable condition. In recent time, Smart Grid 
State  Estimation  is  very  vulnerable  to  False  Data  Injection  Attacks.  In  this  chapter,  the  overview  of  State 
Estimation in both transmission level and distribution level is discussed. The evolution  of State Estimation in 
the Smart Grid and its requirements are also explained. The review of False Data Injection attack is explained 
with a case study. It is expected that utilities, industries and academics should be more concerned to develop the 
countermeasures and protection strategies against this type of attacks.
