ABSTRACT 

This paper outlines the design and development of a survey targeting the cyber-security culture 
assessment  of  critical  infrastructures  during  the  COVID-19  crisis,  when  living  routine  was 
seriously disturbed and working reality fundamentally affected. Its foundations lie on a security 
culture  framework  consisted  of  10  different  security  dimensions  analysed  into  52  domains 
examined  under  two  different  pillars:  organizational  and  individual.  In  this  paper,  a  detailed 
questionnaire building analysis is being presented while revealing the aims, goals and expected 
outcomes  of  each  question.  It  concludes  with  the  survey  implementation  and  delivery  plan 
following a number of pre-survey stages each serving a specific methodological purpose.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Coronavirus  disease  2019,  widely  known  as  COVID-19,  is  an  infectious  dis-ease  caused  by 
severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome  coronavirus  2  (SARS-CoV-2)  [1].  The  disease  was  first 
detected in late 2019 in the city  of Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province [2]. In March 
2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic [3]. 
To-day,  with  more than 11  million confirmed  cases  in 188 countries and at least half a  million 
casualties,  the  virus  is  continuing  its  spread  across  the  world.  While  epidemiologists  argue  that 
the crisis is not even close to being over, it soon become apparent that “the COVID-19 pandemic 
is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core” [4].   

Terms  such  as  “Great  Shutdown”  and  “Great  Lockdown”  [5,  6,  7]  have  been  introduced  to 
attribute  the  major  global  recession  which  arose  as  an  eco-nomic  consequence  of  the  ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic. The first noticeable sign of the coronavirus recession was the 2020 stock 
market  crash  on  the  20th  February.  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  in  the  April  World 
Economic Outlook projected global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 percent. This is a downgrade of 
6.3  percentage  points  from  January  2020,  making  the  “Great  Lockdown”  the  worst  recession 
since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis [7]. According to the 
International  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  Monitor,  published  on  7th  April  2020,  full  or  partial 
lockdown  measures  are  affecting  almost  2.7  billion  workers,  representing  around  81%  of  the 
world’s workforce [8].

Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT) 

Organizations from different business domains and operation areas across the globe try to survive 
this  unprecedented  financial  crisis  by  investing  their  hopes,  efforts  and  working  reality  on 
information  technology  and  digitalization.  Employees  are  being  encouraged  and  facilitated  on 
teleworking  while  most  products  and  services  become  available  over  the  web  while,  in  many 
cases,  transforming  and  adjusting  to  current  rather  demanding  reality.  However,  these 
organizations come up against another COVID-19 side-effect not that apparent: the cyber-crime 
increase.  

The increase in the population percentage connected to the World Wide Web and the expansion 
of time spent online, combined with the sense of confinement and the anxiety and fear generated 
from the lockdown, have formulated a prosperous ground for cyber-criminals to act. Coronavirus 
has rapidly reshaped the  dark web businesses, as buyers and sellers jump on the  opportunity to 
capitalize  on  global  fears,  as  well  as  dramatic  shifts  in  supply  and  demand.  Phishing  emails, 
social  engineering  attacks,  malware,  ransomware  and  spyware,  medical  related  scums, 
investment  opportunities  frauds,  are  only  a  few  examples  of  the  cyber-crime  incidents  reported 
during the crisis period [9, 10]. 

INTERPOL’s  Cybercrime  Threat  Response  team  has  detected  a  significant  increase  in  the 
number of attempted ransomware attacks against key organizations and infrastructure engaged in 
the virus response. Cybercriminals are using ransomware to hold hospitals and medical services 
digitally hostage; preventing them  from accessing vital files and systems until a ransom  is paid 
[11].   

Cyber-security agencies, organizations and experts worldwide have issued recommendations and 
proposed  safeguard  measures  to  assist  individuals  and  corporations  to  defend  against  cyber-
crime. While the virus is dominating in every aspect of our daily lives and human interaction is 
being substituted by digital transactions, cybersecurity gains the role it was deprived from during 
the last years. The question that remains unanswered, given the circumstances, is: What  are the 
COVID-19  pandemic  cyber-security  culture  side-effects  on  both  individual  and  organizational 
level? 

This paper presents the design and delivery plan of a survey aiming to evaluate the cyber-security 
culture  during  COVID-19  pandemic  in  the  critical  infrastructure  domain.  Section  2  presents 
background  information  regarding  the  importance  of  public  cyber-security  surveys  conducted 
over  the  years  emphasizing  on  the  variety  and  originality  of  their  findings.  Building  upon  their 
approach, a detailed methodology is presented in Sections 3 & 4, in an effort to develop a brief, 
targeted  and  comprehensible  survey  for  the  assessment  of  the  cybersecurity  readiness  of 
organizations  during  the  crisis  with  emphasis  on  employees’  feelings,  thoughts,  perspective, 
individuality.  In  Section  5,  we  sketch  the  survey  next  steps  towards  its  conduction  and  fruitful 
completion. Finally, Section 6 concludes by underlying the  importance  of  our survey reasoning 
while focusing on the challenging scientific opportunities that arise from it. 

2.  BACKGROUND   

Over the last decades, cybersecurity surveys have been a powerful asset for information security 
academics and experts seeking to explore the constantly transforming technological reality. Their 
aim  has  been  to  reveal  the  contemporary  trends  on  cybersecurity  threats,  organizations 
investment  priorities,  solutions  for  cloud  security,  threat  management,  application  security, 
security training and certifications, and so many other topics.  

Initially, they were narrowed down and addressed to certain participants depending on the nature 
and  specific  goal  of  each  survey.  A  lighthouse  representative  of  this  kind  was  the  Computer 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)                                  73 

Crime  &  Security  Survey  conducted  by  the  Computer  Security  Institute  (CSI)  with  the 
participation  of  the  San  Francisco  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation’s  (FBI)  Computer  Intrusion 
Squad.  This  annual  survey,  during  its  15  years  of  life  (starting  from  1995  and  reaching  up  to 
2010),  was  probably  one  of  the  longest-running  continuous  surveys  in  the  information  security 
field  [12].  This  far-reaching  study  provided  unbiased  information  and  analysis  about  targeted 
attacks,  unauthorized  access,  incident  response,  organizational  economic  decisions  regarding 
computer security and risk management approaches based on the answers provided by computer 
security  practitioners  in  U.S.  corporations,  government  agencies,  financial  institutions,  medical 
institutions and universities. 

Following  their  lead,  numerous  organizations  of  the  public  and  private  sector  are  seeking 
revealing findings that shall assist them in calibrating their operations and improving their overall 
existence  in  the  business  world  via  cybersecurity  surveys.  Healthcare  Information  and 
Management  Systems  Society  (HIMSS)    focusing  on  the  health  sector  [13];  ARC  Advisory 
Group  targeting  Industrial  Control  Systems  (ICS)  in  critical  infrastructures  such  as  energy  and 
water  supply,  as  well  as  in  process  industries,  including  oil,  gas  and  chemicals  [14];  SANS 
exploring the challenges involved with design, operation and risk  management of ICS, its cyber 
assets and communication protocols, and supporting operations [15]; Deloitte in conjunction with 
Wakefield  Research  interviewing  C-level  executives  who  oversee  cybersecurity  at  companies 
[16]; these being only some of the countless examples available nowadays. 

Current  trend  in  the  cybersecurity  surveys  appears  to be  broadening  their  horizon  by  becoming 
available and approachable to individuals over the internet [17, 18]. Since their goal is to reach 
out  and  attract  more  participants,  thus  achieving  a  greater  data  collection  and,  consequently, 
enforcing their results, tend to be shorter, more comprehensive to the majority of common people 
and apparently web-based. 

Recognizing the unique  value  of this undisputable fruitful security  evaluation  methodology and 
rushing from the special working and living circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we 
identified  the  research  opportuning  to  evaluate  how  this  crisis  has  affected  the  cybersecurity 
culture of both individuals and organizations across the suffering globe. Security threats, frauds, 
breaches  &  perils  have  been  brought  to  the  light,  recommendations  have  been  given  and 
precautions have been made [19, 20, 21]. What about the cybersecurity culture and its potential 
scars  from  this  virus?  Addressing  this  concern  was  our  aim  when  designing,  conducting  and 
analysing the survey presented in this paper. 

3.  SECURITY CULTURE FRAMEWORK 

During the last months, we have been conducting a thorough scientific research related to cyber-
security  tools,  solutions  and  frameworks  with  a  clear  focus  on  the  human  factor.  We  have 
benchmarked  the  dominant  reveals  on  the  field,  classified  their  possibilities  and  analysed  their 
core  security  factors.  Having  identified  their  gaps  and  overlaps,  common  grounds  and 
differentiations  and  thoroughly  studied  several  academic  principles  regarding  information 
security,  including  technical  analyses,  algorithmic  frameworks,  mathematical  models,  statistical 
computations,  behavioural,  organizational  and  criminological  theories,  we  have  created  a 
foundation  combining  the  elements  that  constitute  the  critical  cyber-security  culture  elements 
[22].  The  suggested  cybersecurity  culture  framework  is  based  on  a  domain  agnostic  security 
model  combining  the  key  factors  affecting  and  formulating  the  cybersecurity  culture  of  an 
organization. It consists of 10 different security dimensions analysed into 52 domains assessed by 
more  than  500  controls  examined  under  two  different  pillars:  the  organizational  and  the 
individual level. This hierarchical approach is being presented in Figure 1 while Figure 2 lists the 
model dimensions per level.

Figure 2.  Cyber-Security Culture Model: Levels & Dimensions 

An assessment methodology along with a weighting algorithm have been developed based on the 
previously  mentioned  model  in  order  to  offer  a  clockful  cyber-security  culture  evaluation 
framework which shall be used as the basis of survey under design. 

4.  DESIGNING THE SURVEY 

Our  aim  is  to  design  a  survey  which  shall  be  short  and  targeted  getting  the  security  pulse  of 
current business reality in the critical infrastructure domain. One of our major goals is to keep the 
questionnaire  small  and  easily  addressed  in  a  timely  manner  by  a  common  employee  with  no 
special  security  expertise  or  knowledge.  This  way,  we  can  facilitate  participation  of  a  broader 
workforce  group  minimizing  effort  and  prerequisites  while  maximizing  result  variation  and 
credibility. Towards that goal, we  need to formulate  questions to target specific security factors 
bridging  various  security  domains  while  smartly  extracting  information  depicting  the  existing 
working security routine and culture, their disruption by the COVID-19 crisis and their reaction 
to these special and rather demanding circumstances.

On  the  other  hand,  taking  into  consideration  the  reported  cyber-crime  incidents  along  with  the 
fraud and attack techniques used by the criminals of the dark web during this period, we focused 
our  evaluation  on  specific  dimensions  related  to  network  infrastructure,  asset  management, 
business continuity, employee awareness and attitude. 

In  the  paragraphs  to  follow,  we  outline  how  starting  from  a  detailed  cyber-security  culture 
framework  with  more  than  500  controls,  we  have  narrowed  down  our  objectives  to  a 
questionnaire containing no more than 23 questions, depending on the provided answers. Table 1 
indexes  the  questions  constituting  the  final  version  of  our  questionnaire  including  secondary 
clarification questions presented based on provided participant input whereas Table 2 correlates 
each of the questions to specific cyber-security levels, dimensions and domains of our model.

Culture is defined as a set of shared attitudes, values, goals and practices that define an institution 
or  organization.  Consequently,  cyber-security  culture  refers  to  the  set  of  values,  conventions, 
practices, knowledge, beliefs and behaviours associated with information security. Therefore, its 
skeleton is being outlined by the working environment along with the technological infrastructure 
and security countermeasures that define it.  

To  understand,  evaluate  and  analyse  the  security  cultural  status  of  the  critical  infrastructure 
organizations participating to our survey, we have included questions Q1-Q10 that heartbeat the 
overall  technological  and  security  readiness  and  adaptability.  Under  the  coronavirus  prism,  we 
intend  to  understand  if  teleworking  was  possible  prior  to  the  crisis  or  not  and  under  which 
security policies. Thus, we have included queries polling the remote access procedures and their 
meeting standards as well as the types, configuration and management of the devices used to gain 
access to the corporate environments. In other words, we attempt to assess the way and the means 
of the working from home experience with a clear focus on cyber-security. 

Additionally, we intend to assess the security maturity of the management, the security response 
team  and  awareness  training  program  by  introducing  a  number  of  questions  clearly  related  to 
cyber-security familiarity and readiness. The  most critical  question  of these  category  is the  one 
referring  to  security  guidelines  provided  during  the  COVID-19  crisis  seeking  to  match  their 
responsiveness  and  contemporality.  Informing  your  workforce  by  issuing  supportive  guiding 
principles  following  the  example  of  leading  cyber-security  entities  and  experts  during  rather 
confusing and challenging periods is a core security indicator. 

Another business facet which is examined, although not directly related to information security, 
is the collaboration possibilities offered to employees. Communication and teamwork need to be 
facilitated and promoted, especially during this time period when general isolation is mandated as 
the only defence against the virus spread. Companies are expected to provide all means necessary 
to assist their employees in being productive, effective and cooperative. This notion and quality 
are being tested via two simplified questions included into our survey. 

4.2.  Individual Level 

Moving  down  to  an  individual  level,  evaluation  becomes  more  demanding  since  virus  fear  and 
emotional  stress  dominate  every  aspect  of  daily  life  directly  or  indirectly  affecting  the  human 
related security factors. Questions Q11-Q12 attempt to probe the security behaviour, attitude and 
competency  of  the  remote  workers  by  examining  their  emotions,  thoughts  and  beliefs  and  by 
asking them to report any security incidents they came up against. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)                                  77 

Questions  Q13-Q16  refer  to  generic  information  used  for  an  individual  profiling  and 
categorization  which  shall  enable  us  to  analyse  gathered  results  under  different  prisms  offering 
various  grouping  possibilities  and  leading  to  possibly  interesting  findings  on  the  basis  of  age, 
industry, education, working experience and expertise.

The accruing questionnaire manages to effectively and efficiently combine the two security levels 
of  our  framework.  Additionally,  its  contents  have  been  tailored  to  rapidly  yet  effectually 
heartbeat the cyber-security reality during a disrupting chronological period, such as the COVID-
19 pandemic. This agile instrument, although offering a quick and fruitful measurement method 
compared to similar concurrent surveys, it cannot be considered an in-depth information security 
assessment.  Furthermore,  it  should  not  be  used  to  label  participating  organisations  but  only  to 
provide an overview of current status. 

5.  NEXT STEPS 

Having developed a first questionnaire version addressing the security elements of interest based 
on  our  security  culture  framework,  we  need  to  carefully  design  the  rest  of  the  survey 
methodology including: 

  validity testing: identify ambiguous questions or wording, unclear instructions, or other 
problems  prior  to  widespread  dissemination  possibly  conducted  by  a  group  of  survey 
experts, experienced researchers and analysts, certified security and technology officers. 

  delivery method: select the appropriate delivery method and possibly run an instrument 

validity testing to verify survey conduction methodology 

 

sample selection: carefully chose representatives from energy, transport, water, banking, 
financial market, healthcare and digital infra-structure from different European countries 
(e.g. Cyprus, France, Ger-many, Greece, Italy, Romania, Spain) affected by the COVID-
19 crisis. 

 

survey  duration:  defining  a  specific  start  and  end  period  communicated  to  all  invited 
parties. 

6.  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 

Our  survey  focuses  on  evaluating  the  security  readiness  and  responsiveness  of  corporations 
during  the  Great  Shutdown  and  more  specifically  it  shall  be  addressing  critical  infrastructure 
domain representatives from different countries affected by the coronavirus.  

Security  cultural  approach  demands  flexibility  and  concurrency.  In  a  radically  evolving  and 
transforming environment, security and risk teams need to become part of the crisis management 
group,  remote  working  employees  need  to  remain  vigilant  to  cyber-threats  and  operations  life-

cycle  needs  to  remain  uninterrupted  especially  for  the  operators  of  essentials  services.  Our 
research  aims  to  investigate  if  and  in  what  extend  is  this  approach  embraced  by  the  critical 
infrastructure organizations in different countries  nowadays while revealing  interesting findings 
related to cyber-security and inspiring further scientific researches on this field.
