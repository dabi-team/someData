Abstract—Global  Navigation  Satellite  Systems 

(GNSS) 
brought navigation to the masses. Coupled with smartphones, the 
blue dot in the palm of our hands has forever changed the way we 
interact with the world. Looking forward, cyber-physical systems 
such as self-driving cars and aerial mobility are pushing the limits 
of  what  localization  technologies  including  GNSS  can  provide. 
This  autonomous  revolution  requires  a  solution  that  supports 
safety-critical  operation,  centimeter  positioning,  and  cyber-
security for millions of users. To meet these demands, we propose 
a  navigation  service  from  Low  Earth  Orbiting  (LEO)  satellites 
which  deliver  precision  in-part  through  faster  motion,  higher 
power signals for added robustness to interference, constellation 
autonomous  integrity  monitoring  for  integrity,  and  encryption  / 
authentication for resistance to spoofing attacks. This paradigm is 
enabled  by  the  ‘New  Space’  movement,  where  highly  capable 
satellites  and  components  are  now  built  on  assembly  lines  and 
launch  costs  have  decreased  by  more  than  tenfold.  Such  a 
ubiquitous  positioning  service  enables  a  consistent  and  secure 
standard  where  trustworthy  information  can  be  validated  and 
shared, extending the electronic horizon from sensor line of sight 
to an entire city. This enables the situational awareness needed for 
true safe operation to support autonomy at scale.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Satellite  navigation  has  empowered  our  society,  from  the 
directionally challenged individual to the complex systems we 
rely  upon.  Global  Navigation  Satellite  Systems  (GNSS)  find 
utility in nearly all facets of modern life, from the source of time 
for our communications networks to the source of safety-critical 
positioning in civil aviation. The now more than five billion [1] 
GNSS-enabled  smartphones  in  our  pockets  have  removed  the 
mystery from getting from point A to point B, forever changing 
the way we interact with our physical world. Another revolution 
is  on 
the  horizon,  one  which  promises  disruption  of 
transportation, mobility, and safety. Autonomous systems in the 
form of self-driving cars, autonomous aerial platforms, mobile 
robotics, and others are on the rise, targeting improved access to 
the mobility of people, goods, and services. This transformation 
is one whose  complexity  demands more than  what navigation 
systems  today  can  provide.  Here,  we  present  a  vision  for  a 
connected and autonomous future  which leverages investment 
in new space infrastructure to create a system for a unified and 

ubiquitous  backbone  for  navigation  services  that  are  robust, 
reliable, and secure.  

To understand, where navigation is headed, we first turn to 
the  past  and  begin  with  an  assessment  of  the  historical  trend. 
This includes contemporary drivers of new needs in accuracy, 
coverage, and capability as well as the technologies developed 
in  the  evolution  from  the  sextant  to  the  now  more  than  one 
hundred navigation satellites in service today. This shows a clear 
trend: In the last century, there has been an order of magnitude 
improvement in location accuracy every thirty years. Each step 
has  required  investment  in  new  infrastructure  to  reach  new 
capabilities. With meter-level positioning first widely available 
in the mid-1990s with GPS, this implies that the mid 2020s will 
demand decimeter, or better, performance.  

Autonomous systems are one of many coming applications 
that  drive  this  need,  where  it  is  estimated  that  10  cm,  95% 
accuracy  in  position  will  be  required  for  self-driving  cars  [2]. 
Several  technologies  are  emerging  to  meet  this  challenge. 
LiDAR,  computer  vision,  radar,  and  GNSS  are  all  striving 
towards this requirement. Though some have shown progress in 
meeting these needs in certain circumstances or conditions, they 
all struggle to fully solve the problem to the level of reliability, 
safety, and security that is needed. LiDAR and vision struggle 
in  inclement  weather  due  to  absorption  or  scattering  and  is 
further hindered by occlusions. Radar, though more impervious 
to  weather,  is  limited  by  sensor noise and  resolution. LiDAR, 
vision,  and  radar  approaches  also  require  a  data  intensive 
localization map layer which must  be maintained and  updated 
frequently  and  has  been  identified  as  a  major  risk  of  the 
technology.  

GNSS approaches have also seen substantial investment in 
the  Advanced  Driver  Assistance  System  (ADAS)  and  full 
autonomous driving domains [3]. There is now continent-scale 
deployment  of  GNSS  monitoring  stations  which 
target 
widespread accuracy at scale, delivering correction services via 
cellular connectivity. Though accuracy is approaching the needs 
of  autonomy,  other  risks  remain  with 
interference  and 
cybersecurity. Radio Frequency (RF) interference is a growing 
threat  on  the  road.  Typically  motivated  by  privacy  concerns, 
low-cost GNSS jammers are a popular means of disrupting fleet 
tracking. More than 50,000 disruptions were recorded in Europe 
alone between 2016 – 2018 [4]. The cybersecurity of GNSS is 

 
 
leaving  vulnerabilities 

another  emerging  threat.  Civil  GNSS  signals  are  unencrypted 
and  unauthenticated, 
that  can  be 
exploited  with  counterfeit  (spoofed)  signals.  In  2019,  this 
vulnerability  was  demonstrated  in  autonomy  with  a  staged 
spoofing attack on a Tesla Model S and Model 3, creating unsafe 
behavior of the autopilot [5].  

scalability,  and 

The  challenge  facing  the  auto  makers  is  how  to  achieve 
localization  requirements  on  accuracy,  availability,  integrity, 
security  while  maintaining 
continuity, 
reasonable  Cost,  Size,  Weight,  and  Power 
(CSWaP). 
Furthermore,  these  systems  will  interoperate  in  our  cities, 
necessitating  a  common  standard.  The  safest  maneuvers  are 
informed  with  the  most  complete  picture  of  the  surroundings. 
This requires going beyond the line of sight of vehicle sensors 
and creating situational awareness at city levels. This demands 
an environment of collaborative data sharing through broadband 
connectivity  and  vehicle communication. This allows vehicles 
and  infrastructure  to  act  collectively,  improving  safety  and 
reducing the risk of collision. Such data sharing is only effective 
if there is an agreed upon standard and datum with appropriate 
measures for data security. 

Investment in infrastructure for the establishment of such a 
standardized system offers the potential for the most economical 
and  lightweight  navigation  solution  for  the  end  user.  Satellite 
navigation  offers  a  ubiquitous  reach  with  established  global 
datums and seems to be the logical choice for such a universal 
standard.  Though  navigation  accuracy 
the 
requirements  for  autonomous  driving  with  GNSS  through 
subscription-based  correction  services  and  capable  receiver 
chipsets,  autonomy  has  elevated  expectations  on  navigation 
services with respect to resilience in the face of interference and 
cybersecurity.  

is  nearing 

To  meet  these  demands,  we  propose  a  navigation  service 
from  Low Earth Orbiting  (LEO)  small  satellites.  As  shown in 
Fig. 1, compared to GNSS in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), such 
satellites  would  reside  twenty  to  forty  times  closer  to  Earth, 
having  substantial  implications  for  user  performance  and 
satellite payload cost. LEO satellites provide robust accuracy, in 
part  through  rapid  estimation  of  carrier  phase  ambiguities  via 
speedier  motion  across  the  sky.  Proximity  to  Earth  leads  to 
potentially  stronger  signals  for  the  end  user,  giving  better 
tracking performance and substantial resilience in the face of RF 
interference.  Lastly,  such  a  signal  is  not  bound  by  legacy 
systems  and  can  be  designed  with  encryption  and  data 
authentication for resistance to spoofing attack.  

Traditionally  the  domain  of  government  organizations, 
building  such  a  satellite  navigation  service  is  unprecedented. 
However, there is also revolution underway in the space sector. 
The New Space movement challenges the traditional approach, 
resulting in a  ten to one  hundredfold reduction in  the  cost per 
kilogram  to orbit  [6].  Satellites and components have  become 
commoditized  and  roll  off  assembly  lines  instead  of  being 
individually crafted for each mission. These ingredients create 
an  ecosystem  where  Mega  Constellations  of  thousands  of 
satellites  are  being  constructed  by  the  likes  of  OneWeb  and 
SpaceX  to  meet  global  demand  for  broadband.  Along  with 
existing  GNSS  infrastructure,  this  New  Space  ecosystem 

provides  the  elements  needed  for  a  viable  commercial  LEO 
navigation service.

the GPS constellation in MEO.  

II.  THE DECADE OF THE DECIMETER 

To understand the trend in navigation going forward, we first 
turn  to  an  examination  of  the  past.  This  section  explores 
historical  drivers  of  navigation  needs  and  the  supporting 
technologies developed to meet new requirements. We further 
discuss  where  demands  might  be  headed  and  the  applications 
driving them today.  

Many  systems,  methods,  and  tools  have  been  deployed  to 
help  humans  and  machines  find  their  way.  New  applications 
pushed  the  capability  of  navigation  approaches  and  some 
demanded new technologies. Fig. 2 shows the progress in Root-
Mean-Squared  (RMS)  positioning  accuracy  available  from 
contemporary  navigation  systems  throughout  the  last  century. 
This  is  not  an  exhaustive  list  of  every  available  navigation 
system, or techniques, but it is representative of the accuracies 
widely  accessible.  This  shows  a  clear  trend:  a  tenfold 
improvement in location accuracy every thirty years.  

At the turn of the 20th century, celestial navigation was the 
state-of-the-art  in  location  technology.  Developed  in-part  to 
help  mariners  find  their  way, it  has been  used at  sea  since at 
least  the  16th  century  [7].  In  the  early  20th  century,  this 
technology was capable of delivering kilometer-level accuracy 
[8], sufficient for ships to get within sight of land. The Second 
World War saw rapid growth in aviation and with it the need 
for new navigation capability in the 1940s. This was met with 
the emergence of ground-based radio navigation systems such 
as  GEE  [9]  and  later  LORAN-C  [10]  as  well  as  Distance 
Measuring Equipment (DME) [11]. This supported all weather 
operation  to  an  accuracy  of  a  few  hundred  meters.  The  Cold 
War brought new accuracy requirements with ballistic missile 
submarines  that  could  remain  submerged  for  weeks,  even 

 
 
months  at  a  time.  This  required  unprecedented  accuracy  to 
initialize  inertial  systems  that  would  run  without  update  for 
extended  periods.  This  was  met  with  the  first  satellite 
navigation  system,  the  U.S. Transit  in  1964.  Operated  by  the 
U.S.  Navy,  Transit  brought  tens  of  meters  of  accuracy  and 
refined the science of geodesy for continual improvement over 
its operational lifetime of nearly thirty years [12], [13]. 

Fig.  2:  The  progress  in  location  accuracy  and  associated  contemporary 
technologies  over  the  last  century  [2].  This  shows  a  clear  trend:  a  ten  times 
improvement in location accuracy every thirty years. 

The  need  for  precision  continued,  where  real-time  meter-
level positioning was desired for fast moving military platforms 
and  precision  tactical  strikes.  One  of  the  mottos  of  the  Joint 
Program Office of the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) 
was to “drop five bombs in the same hole” [14]. GPS was at full 
operational  capability  in  1995  with  24  satellites  in  MEO. 
However, it was not until the year 2000 that civilians learned of 
the  system’s  full  potential.  Initial  degradation of civil  signals 
resulted in position errors that could be as large as 100 meters 
[15]. Known as Selective Availability (SA), it was in place to 
prevent enemies from using the system to its full potential. On 
May 2, 2000, SA was turned off by presidential mandate as the 
potential  economic  benefit  outweighed  the  once  perceived 
threat  [16].  This  enabled  meter-level  positioning  as  an  open, 
public,  and  free  service  worldwide.  The  first  GPS-enabled 
phones were released in 2000 and the first GPS smartphone in 
2005 [17]. The demand for smartphones and the economies of 
scale contributed to the now more than 6 billion GNSS-enabled 
devices worldwide [1].  

With every new order of magnitude in position accuracy, a 
new  investment  in  infrastructure  was  required.  Ground-based 
radio beacons were erected for aviation, satellites launched for 
submarines,  and  now  GNSS  touches  nearly  all  aspects  of 
modern life. Following the trend in navigation shown in Fig. 2, 
the  mid-2020s  are  poised  for  new  infrastructure  to  support 
decimeter location. Where historically military capability drove 
innovation  and  investment  in  infrastructure  for  positioning, 
commercial  needs  are  driving  demand  today.  Decimeter,  and 

even  centimeter  localization  is  being  sought  by  autonomous 
transportation  systems  such  as  self-driving  cars.  Current 
assessments  indicate  that  autonomous  highway  driving  will 
require 10 cm RMS accuracy, where city driving will require 5 
cm [2]. A representation of the protection levels needed for in-
lane positioning is shown in Fig. 3. A diversity of infrastructure 
is being investigated to meet these needs, from continent-wide 
GNSS  correction  services  to  LiDAR-based  localization  maps 
of all major roads. Section III will discuss these developments 
in more detail.  

Along  with  the  advent  of  the  smartphone,  GNSS  has 
brought  navigation  to  the  masses.  Ubiquitous  meter-level 
location is enough for humans to find their way and hence its 
global impact. Decimeter location is next in this evolution, and 
it  is  driven,  in-part,  by  Intelligent  Transportation  Systems 
(ITS). Decimeters are needed for humans and robotic systems 
to  coexist  and  to  share  the  same  physical  spaces.  This  will 
require not only accuracy, but also new capability in terms of 
guarantees on safety and security.  

III.  LOCALIZATION IN AUTONOMY 

Localization  is  a  foundational  element  of  autonomous 
driving.  Knowledge  of  precise  vehicle  location,  coupled  with 
highly  detailed  maps,  add  the  context  needed  to  drive  with 
confidence.  To  maintain  the  vehicle  within  its  lane,  highway 
operation requires knowledge of location at 50 cm where local 
city roads require 30 cm [2]. The challenge facing auto makers 
is meeting the required level  of  reliability at  99.999999%  [2]. 
This represents one failure per billion miles driven, argued to be 
representative of Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) D, 
the  strictest  in  automotive  [2].  This  has  not  yet  been 
demonstrated for road vehicles. 

Today, self-driving architectures fall predominantly into two 
categories: (1) SAE Level 2 driver assistance and (2) SAE Level 
4  full  autonomy  [3].  SAE  Level  2  systems  are  available  to 
consumers today and combine camera-based lane-line detection 
with radar-based adaptive cruise control for driver assistance in 
highway environments. In comparison, SAE Level 4 systems are 
still in the development phase and strive for fully autonomy with 
no driver input.  

Current SAE Level 4 systems primarily rely on LiDAR for 
localization  but  also  incorporate  cameras  and  radar  for  both 
perception  and  localization  [3].  GNSS  is  not  the  primary 
localization  sensor  due  in  part  to  historical  availability 
challenges  dating  back  to  the  Defense  Advanced  Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge in 2004 [3], [18]. 
Some  LiDAR  localization  approaches  leverage  the  surface 
reflectivity [19]–[21] and others, such as Iterative Closest Point 
(ICP)  [22],  the  entire  3D  structure.  Many  utilize  both  for 
robustness.  

High  Definition  (HD)  maps  in  this  context  contain  a 
localization layer in addition to layers containing the semantic 
road  information  such  as  the  location  of  lane  lines  and  traffic 
signals.  This  localization  layer  consists  of  the  a-priori  surface 
reflectivity  in  addition  to  a  possible  3D  occupancy  map  or 
LiDAR point  cloud of the  intended  driving environment. This 

 
 
results in maps that are substantially more data intensive, with 
the bulk of the data existing in the localization layer.  

In nominal circumstances, LiDAR-based approaches deliver 
the  performance  required  for automated driving. For example, 
Liu  et al.  demonstrated  a LiDAR localization  system  on  1000 
km of road data in 2019  [23]. This yielded better than 10 cm, 
95%  lateral  and  longitudinal  positioning,  meeting  accuracy 
requirements for autonomy.  

while  others  can  operate  without  a map at all [37].  Odometry 
inputs are derived from sources including radar Doppler, visual 
odometry, LiDAR odometry, and wheel speed encoders.  

Precision  GNSS  is  complementary  to  LiDAR.  GNSS' 
microwave signals are unaffected by rain, snow, and fog. GNSS 
also performs best in open sparse environments like highways. 
Because  of  this  synergy,  Baidu's  Apollo  framework  utilizes  a 
LiDAR + IMU + GNSS localization solution [30]. In test drives 
with  the  Baidu  system,  LiDAR-only  localization  reaches  the 
alert limits required for autonomous city driving only 95% of the 
time. The inclusion of an IMU boosts this to 99.99% and with 
precision  GNSS  to  100%  within  the  available  test  drive  data. 
This is substantial since the joint approach strives to address the 
long tail of localization errors.  

GNSS technologies have also seen substantial investment in 
(ADAS)  and 
the  Advanced  Driver  Assistance  System 
autonomous  driving  domains.  There  is  now  continent-scale 
deployment of GNSS monitoring stations in service, delivering 
correction services via cellular. The accuracy required for lane-
determination  to  support  future  ADAS  applications  is  nearing 
production where research systems are approaching that needed 
for full self-driving [3].  

Fig. 3: The lateral, longitudinal, and vertical protection levels required for in-
lane positioning and full autonomous driving. Self-driving cars require 20 cm, 
95% positioning for highway road geometries and 10 cm, 95% for local streets 
[2]. 

Although LiDAR-based localization provides accuracy and 
availability, LiDAR is not immune to failure. Both LiDAR and 
computer  vision  are  adversely  affected  by  inclement  weather 
[24]–[28]. Fog, rain, and snow can result in a 25% reduction of 
LiDAR detection range [26]. Weather conditions further result 
in  a  reduction  of  the  number  of  points  per  object  due  to 
absorption and diffusion [28]. These factors and others have led 
to the U.S. Department of Transportation stating concerns about 
LiDAR’s  ability  to  function  with  road  snow  cover  [24].  This 
concern  is  compounded  by  the  fact  that  the  U.S.  Federal 
Highway Administration estimates 70% of U.S. roads to be in 
snowy regions [29]. 

The  3D  structure of the environment can also change  with 
the seasons or with construction, necessitating frequent updates 
to the LiDAR localization map [30]. Sparse environments with 
limited  distinguishing  structure,  like  open  highways,  can  also 
lead 
[30]. 
Furthermore, 
like  all  sensors,  LiDAR  can  suffer  from 
occlusions,  for example,  by  large  surrounding vehicles, which 
block access to the a-priori information contained in the map.  

localization  performance 

to  poor  LiDAR 

To  mitigate  the  shortcomings  of  LiDAR  as  the  primary 
sensor  for  localization,  it  is  augmented  with  computer  vision, 
inertial  measurement,  and  odometry  inputs  [3].  A  variety  of 
computer vision approaches to localization have been proposed 
[31]. Some methods rely on semantic maps [32], global-feature 
maps  [33],  landmarks  [34],  and  3D  LiDAR  maps  [35],  [36], 

risks 

remain  with 

Though  GNSS  accuracy  is  approaching  the  needs  of 
interference  and 
autonomy,  other 
cybersecurity. RF interference is a growing threat on the road. 
Often motivated by privacy concerns, low-cost GNSS jammers 
are a popular means of disrupting fleet tracking. Between 2016 
and 2018, more than 50,000 such disruptions were recorded in 
Europe alone [4], [38].  

The  cybersecurity  of  GNSS  is  another  emerging  concern. 
Civil  GNSS  signals  are  unencrypted  and  unauthenticated, 
leaving  vulnerabilities  that  can  be  exploited  with  counterfeit 
(spoofed) signals. Just less than ten years ago, GNSS spoofing 
required specialized expertise and equipment costs of upwards 
of  $50,000  [39].  Now,  with  open  source  software  and  more 
accessible hardware, spoofing attacks can be accomplished for 
as little as $100 [39].  

With  increasing  accessibility  to  spoofing  has  come  higher 
frequency  and  severity  of  attacks.  For  example,  at  the  2019 
Geneva  Motor  Show,  several  automotive  manufactures 
including  Audi,  Peugeot,  Renault,  Rolls-Royce,  Volkswagen, 
Daimler-Benz, and BMW reported their vehicles’ GNSS to be 
in  Buckingham,  England  in  the  year  2036,  the  result  from  a 
suspected  widespread  spoofing  attack  [40].  Later  in  2019, 
researchers at Regulus Cyber demonstrated this vulnerability in 
autonomy with a staged spoofing attack on a Tesla Model S and 
Model 3, creating unsafe behavior of the autopilot [5].  

Ultimately, LiDAR, radar, computer vision, inertial sensors, 
and  satellite  navigation  will  require  combination  to  leverage 
their individual strengths in creating a truly reliable system fit 
for  safety  critical  autonomous  operation.  Challenges  remain 
with each of these sensors in achieving the needed availability, 
integrity,  and  security  in  all  weather  and  desired  operating 
conditions.  In  the  next  section,  we  outline  an  infrastructure 
approach  for robust, precise, and  secure  satellite navigation to 
address the needs of autonomy.  

 
 
IV.  NEW SPACE FOR NAVIGATION 

In  recent  decades,  the  New  Space  movement  has  led  to  a 
paradigm shift in aerospace. Driven by commercial needs, non-
traditional aerospace ventures have worked to develop faster and 
cheaper access to space. This model has led to new possibilities, 
including  the  Mega  Constellations  proposed  by  the  likes  of 
OneWeb1, SpaceX, Telesat, and Amazon for global broadband 
internet.  With  new  launch  providers  and  tens  of  thousands  of 
satellites proposed, this has created circumstances for revolution 
in  several 
industries.  Though  satellite  navigation  has 
traditionally  been  the  arena  of  governments,  the  elements  for 
commercial satellite navigation are now present. In this section, 
we present a concept for a commercial navigation service that 
meets the needs of autonomous systems under the New Space 
model and discuss the relevant trade space in the space segment.  

A.  New Space 

Traditional aerospace is  dominated  by mission-centric risk 
adverse programs, resulting in high costs and long development 
times. The New Space approach is one associated with Silicon 
Valley which questions the conventional and searches for major 
strides, rather than baby steps [41]. The New Space philosophy 
transforms the space market demand into products and services, 
often accepting  higher than  traditional  levels  of risk  [42]. The 
result  is  new  launch  providers,  new  satellite  manufacturing 
techniques,  ground  stations  as  a  service,  and  new  models  for 
financing space ventures [41].  

the 

Perhaps the poster child of this movement is SpaceX, which 
traditional  aerospace  approach  and 
has  challenged 
successfully  driven  down  the  cost  per  kilogram  to  orbit. 
Compared  to  the  Space  Shuttle,  the  SpaceX  Falcon  9  rocket 
offers a twentyfold  reduction  in the cost  per kilogram  to LEO 
[6].  Adjusted  for  inflation,  launch  costs  remained  relatively 
fixed  between  1970  and  2000,  where  many  of  these  launch 
systems are still in service today [6]. The Falcon Heavy offers 
an additional twofold  reduction  in cost, and  rocket reusability 
the  potential  for  a  further  twofold  or  more  cost  reduction  [6]. 
The  net  result  is  a  near  hundredfold  reduction  in  cost  per 
kilogram to LEO.  

subsystems, 

satellite  buses, 

In addition to disruption in launch services, there has been 
substantial innovation in  small  satellite technology and design 
philosophies.  The  movement  is  towards  standardization  and 
commoditization  of 
and 
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. Rather than a 
focus  on  specialized  space  parts,  careful  selection  and  trial  of 
industrial  and  automotive-grade  components  can  yield  highly 
capable satellites at a lower cost and faster development cycle 
[43]. One such small satellite standard is the CubeSat introduced 
in  2000  [44],  [45],  though  others  have  been  proposed  [46]. 
Standard CubeSats consist of “Units” that are 10 cm x 10 cm x 
11.35 cm, designed to provide 1 liter of useful volume. This has 
become a widespread industry standard, where 3U, 6U, and even 
12U satellite buses are now a commodity offered by the likes of 
Pumpkin, Blue  Canyon,  and  NanoAvionics  [47].  To highlight 
the  capability  of  these  platforms,  consider  that  Planet’s  more 
than 200 Earth imaging satellites (Doves) [48] are 3U satellites 

1 At the time of publication, OneWeb announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  

[49]. This represents nearly ten percent of the 2,218 operational 
satellites  in  Earth  orbit  today  [48]  and  is  the  New  Space 
paradigm in action.  

Low-cost access to space along with commoditized satellite 
buses and components opens new possibilities, and the potential 
for  revolution.  One  such  movement  is  underway  with  the  so-
called Mega Constellations proposed by the likes of OneWeb, 
SpaceX,  Telesat,  and  Amazon.  Driven  by  the  demand  for 
broadband, tens of thousands of small satellites are planned for 
LEO.  OneWeb,  in  partnership  with  Airbus,  is  producing 
satellites on assembly lines at a rate of two per day [50], where 
74  satellites are already on orbit towards an end goal  of  up to 
900  [51].  SpaceX  is  leading  the  charge  with  422  Starlink 
satellites on orbit, where 60 are launched at a time at a possible 
three-week  cadence  [52].  Starlink  is  the  most  audacious  with 
plans  for  42,000  satellites,  and  already  is  the  largest  satellite 
constellation  on  orbit  [53].  Telesat  has  partnered  with  the 
Canadian government  to  build a constellation of  300  satellites

April 2019 [56]. Though Amazon has nothing on orbit, it has a 
head start with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Ground Station, 
designed  to  support  the  traffic  of  Mega  Constellations  as  a 
service  [57].  Combined,  these  Mega  Constellations  represent 
more than five times the total number of space objects launched 
since the first satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957 [58]. Details of these 
systems are summarized in Table 1.

B.  Navigation from LEO  

With  LEO  Mega  Constellations  entering  production  for 
global broadband, it begs the question, what might be possible 
for satellite navigation under the New Space model? Much work 
has been done in the domain of LEO-based satellite navigation. 
In this section, we describe this progress along with the current 
capability of commercial LEO Position, Navigation, and Time 
(PNT) services already available.  

Compared  to  GNSS  in  MEO,  LEO  offers  several  distinct 
advantages  and  trades  as  described  in  [62].  Up  to  forty  times 
closer to Earth, LEO offers nearly 30 dB (1000x) less zenith path 
loss as shown in Fig. 4, offering the potential for stronger signals 

 
 
 
and hence resilience to radio interference. Passing overhead in 
minutes compared to hours, this rapid geometry change offers 
observability for rapid convergence of carrier phase differential 
precise positioning. The trade-off is  satellite  footprint, it takes 
nearly  tenfold  more  satellite  in  LEO  to  obtain  the  satellite 
visibility of GNSS in MEO.  

possibilities  of  such  a  low-cost  system,  yielding  useful 
navigation signals from LEO in 2018 [78], [79].  

Recent  work  has  examined  concepts  for  improved  Precise 
Point Positioning (PPP) through devoted LEO constellations for 
augmentation of GNSS [80]–[82]. These constellations range in 
size from 60 to nearly 300 satellites, placed at altitudes between 
780 km and 1200 km.  

C.  LEO for Autonomous Navigation 

Data  signed  and  authenticated  with  a  secure  and 
standardized source of time and location empowers autonomous 
systems through reliable data sharing and in building collective 
situational  awareness  for  safe  and  collaborative  autonomy  at 
scale.  Along  with  correction  services,  GNSS  and  other 
technologies  are  on  track  to  deliver  the  accuracy  needed  for 
autonomy.  However,  as  discussed  in  Section  III,  the  major 
missing elements in the combination of GNSS, LiDAR, radar, 
and vision are guarantees on integrity and cybersecurity.  

Fig. 4: Free space path loss as a function of orbital altitude. 

In  the  mid-1990s,  plans  for  global  cellular  ‘Big’  LEO 
Constellations  such  as  Iridium  [63],  Globalstar  [64],  and 
Orbcomm [65] were underway, leading to interest in their use 
for navigation. Rabinowitz et al. examined the benefits of a GPS 
+  LEO  system  for  rapid  resolution  of  integer  ambiguities  for 
carrier-phase differential precise positioning [66], [67]. Joerger 
et  al.  examined  the  integration  GPS  and  Iridium  for  precision 
and integrity (iGPS) [68], [69].  

  The  Iridium-based  Satellite  Time  and  Location  (STL) 
service became operational in May of 2016 [70], [71]. Built by 
Satelles in partnership with Iridium Communications Inc., many 
from  industry  and  government  are  already  using  this  service. 
This  system  has  demonstrated  a  positioning  accuracy  of  20 
meters  and  timekeeping  to  within  1  microsecond,  all  in  deep 
attenuation  environments  indoors,  showcasing  the  improved 
signal strength from LEO [70].  

  Morales  et  al.  investigated  LEO  communications  satellite 
signals  of  opportunity  for  navigation  including  inertial  aiding 
[72]–[74].  There 
in  LEO 
is  also  commercial 
communication  signals  of  opportunity. In  2019,  Globalstar, in 
partnership with Echo Ridge, announced the joint development 
of their Augmented Positioning System (APS) [75] which uses 
satellite  communication  signals,  not  specialized  navigation 
signals, to produce accurate PNT information [76]. 

interest 

The concept of a low-cost navigation payload intended for 
LEO  was  first  introduced  by  the  authors  in  [77].  This  work 
showed  that  the  performance  of  GPS  could  theoretically  be 
matched  with  low-cost  and  space  flown  COTS  components 
hosted on a LEO  Mega  Constellation of the  type  proposed by 
OneWeb. The Luojia-1A demonstration satellite showcased the 

Fig.  5:  Desired  properties  of  a  LEO  navigation  service  for  intelligent 
transportation systems: encrypted signals with data authentication for resistance 
to  spoofing  attack,  stronger  signals  for  resilience  against  interference,  and 
precise positioning aided by rapid geometry change.  

A LEO-based navigation service holds potential to provide 
the  backbone  to  meet  the  navigation  demands  of  Intelligent 
Transportation  Systems  (ITS).  When  combined,  the  elements 
discussed in the review of LEO navigation give rise to precision 
through rapid carrier-phase ambiguity resolution, robustness to 
interference  through  stronger  signals,  and  higher  availability 
through more  satellites.  Unbounded  by legacy  signals, a LEO 
service can further introduction of novel signal encryption and 
authentication for resistance to spoofing. The desired properties 
of such a LEO navigation service are summarized in Fig. 5.  

With a potential blank slate, what might be desirable from 
new navigation signals beyond the inclusion of encryption and 
authentication? It has been suggested by van Diggelen [83] that 
future  navigation  services  might  benefit 
from  signal 
simplification.  Today,  each  GNSS  system  has  at  least  a  half-

 
 
 
 
 
dozen signal components, many targeting the needs of specific 
users.  Since  each  signal  consumes  power  at  the  satellite, 
reducing  this  to  two  signals  could  yield  higher  efficiency  and 
either a smaller and simpler satellite or more powerful signals.  

This concept is shown in Fig. 7. A GNSS receiver onboard the 
satellite has further implications for orbit determination, where 
sub-decimeter  GNSS-based  orbit  determination  has  been 
demonstrated in real-time [90].  

What  might  such  a  satellite  constellation  look  like?  To 
estimate  satellite  size  and  numbers,  we  will  begin  with  first 
principles. Satellite numbers are derived based on the visibility 
and  geometry  they  yield  to  terrestrial  users.  Fig.  6  shows  the 
global Position Dilution of Precision (PDOP) that would result 
from LEO Polar Walker constellations ranging in altitude from 
600  km  to  1400  km.  To  match  the  performance  of  GPS, 
approximately  300  satellites  would  be  required  if  an  altitude 
between 800 and 1000 km were chosen. It should be noted that 
the optimal constellation for LEO navigation may not be a Polar 
Walker  configuration,  like  the  Mega  Constellations,  several 
other forms may be considered [54].  

Fig. 7: Possible architecture of a LEO navigation service.  

Following  [83],  simplifying to  two  signal  components can 
further  reduce  the  required  payload  power.  Since  on  average, 
each signal requires approximately 53 W to produce, with two 
signals plus overhead, this could yield a 100 – 200 W navigation 
payload for LEO. To examine implications for the end user, first 
principles has us look at Watts per square meter. LEO satellite 
footprints  are  smaller  and  hence  spread  this  energy  over  a 
smaller  area,  resulting  in  a  net  gain  compared  to  MEO.  This 
effect is  shown  in  Fig.  8.  For a  signal  that  is  broadcast to the 
horizon, this gain is 6 – 10 dB (4 – 10x). For a spot beam that 
users can only see at elevations greater than 30 degrees, this can 
be 13 – 20 dB (20 – 100x).  Assuming a broadcast to the horizon, 
it appears  that  a  100  –  200 W  navigation  payload could  yield 
signals  4  –  10  times  stronger  to  end  users,  assuming  an  even 
distribution  of  power.  Scaling  also  indicates  that  GNSS-level 
signals can be achieved with 4 – 10 times less payload power, or 
approximately 20 – 50 W with overhead. To put satellite size in 
context  at  these  power  levels,  the  OneWeb  150  kg  Arrow 
satellite bus can support a 200 W payload [91] while some 12 
kg 6U CubeSats can support nearly 30 W [92].  

How much more power is useful for ITS? The Iridium-based 
STL  delivers  +30  dB  (1000x)  stronger  signals,  giving  signal 
access  to  stationary  indoor  users  [70].  For  dynamic  vehicles 
requiring precise positioning, indoor navigation might be better 
served  by  other 
the  author’s  personal 
experience  with  autonomous  vehicle  on-road  testing,  two 
culprits caused the most GNSS disruptions: the tree canopy and 
RF interference. Table 2 shows the gains in these categories as a 
function  of  additional  signal  power.  For  simplicity,  this  table 

technologies.  In 

Fig. 6: Global Position Dilution of Precision (95th percentile) as a function of 
Polar Walker Constellation size and altitude. This assumes a 5o elevation mask.  

Satellite  size  is  a  function  of  the  required  payload  power. 
Consider that Galileo satellites host a 900 W navigation payload 
[84]. In part, this consists of two rubidium (35 W / unit) [85] and 
two hydrogen maser clocks (70 W / unit) [86], which combined 
represent  200  W.  This  also  generates  as  many  as  10  signal 
components including E1-A, E1-B, E1-C, E5a-I, E5a-Q, E5b-I, 
E5b-Q, E6-A, E6-B, and E6-C [87] where the combined output 
power of the Galileo FOC satellites ranges between 254 – 273 
W [88]. With a power amplifier efficiency of 51% [89], we can 
estimate the load on the system as being approximately 535 W 
for  navigation  signals  alone.  On  average,  per  signal,  this 
represents approximately 53 W of power draw on the bus.  

To  simplify  a  navigation  payload  intended  for  LEO,  we 
begin with removing the atomic clocks. As suggested by [77], 
GNSS in MEO can be leveraged in LEO to act as the satellite 
long-term  frequency  standard.  Other  clocks  such  as  Oven 
Control  Crystal  Oscillators  (OCXO)  or  Chip-Scale  Atomic 
Clocks  (CSAC)  can  be  considered  for  shorter  term  holdover. 

 
 
 
 
assumes L-band for a direct comparison to GNSS. In terms of 
material penetration, +5 dB is enough for deciduous trees, +10 
dB  for  wooden  walls  and  redwoods,  +20  dB  for  most  tree 
canopies  and  most  walls,  and  +30  dB  for  multiple  walls.  It 
should be noted, however, that even with penetration, challenges 
will  remain  with  multipath.  In  terms  of  jamming  mitigation, 
consider  the  effective  radius  of  a  high  output  civil  GNSS 
jammer, the type typically used to maintain privacy from fleet 
trackers on the road. At 500 mW, the effective radius drops from 
nearly a kilometer to less than the length of a city block at +20 
dB and less than four car lengths at +30 dB.  

Fig.  8:  Satellite  footprint  area  ratio  of  MEO  (Galileo)  and  satellites  at  LEO 
altitudes. To first principles, this shows the net gains of satellites  in LEO  in 
terms of signal transmit power. The different elevation masks represent satellite 
beamwitdths, where narrower beams spread energy over a smaller area.  

What  precision  is  needed?  Fully  autonomous  driving 
requires  10  cm,  95%  positioning  [2].  This  will  be  required 
instantly; convergence times longer than a few seconds will be 

unacceptable. PPP-RTK GNSS corrections are already deployed 
at  continent-scales,  offering  rapid  convergence  with  regional 
atmospheric corrections [3]. Compared to GNSS in MEO, LEO 
offers  rapid  geometry  change,  already  accelerating 
the 
convergence of PPP from tens of minutes to less than 1 minute 
while unaided by atmospheric correction information. This still 
is  not  fast  enough,  indicating  that  some  form  of  atmospheric 
corrections will be needed for a LEO-based system. These could 
be  derived  in  the  same  way  that  corrections  are  today,  with 
networks of ground monitoring stations. However, there is also 
the growing commercial weather data market which could yield 
a mutually beneficial relationship with PNT.  

is  transitioning 

Once  the  domain  of  governments  with  missions  such  as 
COSMIC [93], GNSS Radio Occultation (RO) is a critical input 
to  global  weather  models.  This 
to  the 
commercial  sector,  where  NOAA  and  other  government 
agencies are moving towards purchase of RO and other data. As 
commercial constellations grow from ‘Big’ to ‘Mega’ this gives 
the opportunity not only for more GNSS to LEO-RO soundings 
but  for  LEO  to  LEO  RO  soundings  as  well.  Multi-frequency 
gives  ionospheric  measurements  and  RO  bending  angles  a 
measure  of  water  content  in  the  troposphere.  These  are 
ingredients for atmospheric corrections for precise positioning. 
This can create a positive feedback loop of improved navigation 
signals  for  atmospheric  modeling  and  improved  atmospheric 
modeling for enhanced positioning.  

To  create  such  a  LEO  navigation  service  would  be  cost 
prohibitive if additional LEO signals came with the price tag of 
current GNSS satellites in MEO. The latest GPS III satellites are 
$345M each [94]. In comparison, OneWeb Arrow satellites are 
around  $1M  [95].  By  leveraging  the  GNSS  constellation  in 
MEO for clock and orbit determination, a simplified navigation 
payload for LEO could be constructed to yield stronger signals 
with  encryption  and  authentication.  On  a  constellation  of  300 
satellites,  this  would  add  the  satellite  visibility  and  geometry 
equivalent  to  one  of  GPS,  Galileo,  GLONASS,  or  BeiDou. 
Moreover,  in  the  New  Space  ecosystem,  such  a  constellation 
could conceivably be built for less than the cost of a single GPS 
satellite.

their  effective 

Following  historical  trends  of  new  infrastructure  for  new 
navigation capability, the mid 2020s forecast new investment to 
deliver widespread decimeter, or better, positioning. Intelligent 
Transportation  Systems 
including  self-driving  cars  and 
autonomous  aerial  systems  require  this  precision  to  function. 
Furthermore, 
interoperation  necessitates  a 
common standard. The safest maneuvers are informed with the 
most complete picture of the surroundings. This requires going 
beyond  the  line  of  sight  of  vehicle  sensors  and  creating 
situational  awareness  at  municipal  levels  and  beyond.  This 
demands an environment of collaborative data sharing through 
vehicle  communication  and  broadband  connectivity.  This 
allows vehicles and infrastructure to act collectively, improving 
safety  and  reducing  the  risk  of  collision.  Such  data  sharing  is 
only effective if there is an agreed upon common standard and 
datum with appropriate measures for data security.  

To  meet  these  demands,  we  present  a  concept  for  new 
navigation  infrastructure  in  Low  Earth  Orbiting  (LEO).  The 
navigation benefits from LEO are many. Compared to GNSS in 
MEO, LEO satellites reside twenty to forty times closer to Earth, 
having  substantial  implications  for  user  performance.  LEO 
satellites  can  provide  robust  accuracy,  in  part  through  fast 
convergence  of  precise  positioning  resulting  from  speedier 
motion  across  the  sky.  Proximity  to  Earth  further  leads  to 
stronger  signals  for  the  end  user,  giving  better  tracking 
performance and resilience to radio interference. Such a signal 
is not bound by legacy and can be designed with encryption and 
data  authentication  for  enhanced  security  and  resistance  to 
spoofing attack. Data signed and authenticated with a secure and 
standardized source of time and location empowers autonomous 
systems  through  reliable  data  sharing  in  building  collective 
situational awareness for safe autonomy at scale.   

A LEO constellation of approximately 300 hundred satellites 
can  provide  similar  coverage  to  GPS  today.  With  broadband 
Mega  Constellations  of  tens  of  thousands  of  satellites  being 
constructed  by  the  likes  of  OneWeb,  SpaceX,  Telesat,  and 
Amazon,  highly  capable  satellites  and  components  are  now 
made in  volume  on assembly lines, creating an  ecosystem  for 
previously  unimagined  space 
this 
revolution, a LEO navigation constellation can conceivably be 
built for the cost of a single GPS III satellite.
