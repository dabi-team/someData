Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

EDAN HABLER, RON BITTON, and ASAF SHABTAI, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel

The sophistication and complexity of cyber attacks and the variety of targeted platforms have been growing
in recent years. Various adversaries are abusing an increasing range of platforms, e.g., enterprise platforms,
mobile phones, PCs, transportation systems, and industrial control systems. In recent years, we have witnessed
various cyber attacks on transportation systems, including attacks on ports, airports, and trains. It is only
a matter of time before transportation systems become a more common target of cyber attackers. Due to
the enormous potential damage inherent in attacking vehicles carrying many passengers and the lack of
security measures applied in traditional airborne systems, the vulnerability of aircraft systems is one of the
most concerning topics in the vehicle security domain. This paper provides a comprehensive review of aircraft
systems and components and their various networks, emphasizing the cyber threats they are exposed to
and the impact of a cyber attack on these components and networks and the essential capabilities of the
aircraft. In addition, we present a comprehensive and in-depth taxonomy that standardizes the knowledge and
understanding of cyber security in the avionics field from an adversary’s perspective. The taxonomy divides
techniques into relevant categories (tactics) reflecting the various phases of the adversarial attack lifecycle and
maps existing attacks according to the MITRE ATT&CK methodology. Furthermore, we analyze the security
risks among the various systems according to the potential threat actors and categorize the threats based on
STRIDE threat model. Future work directions are presented as guidelines for industry and academia.

1 Introduction
In light of the significant growth in the number of flights,1 traditional air traffic management
systems (ATMs) have difficulty providing relevant and reliable information on the state of an
aircraft. As a result, the aviation community is actively taking steps to increase flight traffic safety,
capacity, and flexibility, as well as to reduce dependence on outdated infrastructure, by examining
and improving national airspace systems. There are two main projects leading modernization
efforts in the aviation industry: the NextGen2 and SESAR3 projects, respectively led by the US
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Commission. These projects are primarily
aimed at creating new technologies and procedures in order to increase the capacity, accuracy, and
reliability of air traffic control, and privacy and information security have not been prioritized.
Technological advances and modernization processes have been seen in many other areas, such as
the transition to smart transportation, smartphones, and IoT components. At the same time, the
attack surface accessible to cyber attacks is growing. According to Positive Technology’s annual
report, the first quarter of 2021 (Q1) showed a 17% increase in cyber attacks over the same quarter in
the previous year [45]. Moreover, according to Check Point’s ransomware report [6] between June
2020 and June 2021, the transportation industry witnessed a 186% increase in weekly ransomware
attacks. Therefore, it is fair to assume that it is just a matter of time before we see significant cyber
incidents in the avionics field.

As a case in point, in recent years, researchers in academia and industry have pointed out
weaknesses in airborne systems’ design and implementation and demonstrated how some of the
core airborne systems could be tampered with simply by using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)

hardware and software; for instance, Costin et al. [9] simulated attacks on the ADS-B system using
a COTS software-defined radio (SDR) transmitter, and Hugo et al. [65] demonstrated how one can
use a simple Android device to send radio signals and obtain access to the navigation controls of
an aircraft by exploiting the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS).
To better classify the attacks associated with different threats, it is important to analyze the
vulnerabilities of airborne systems, as well as the potential threat actors. Systematically categorizing
adversaries’ behavior will enable the identification of sensitive points in the various platforms and
the stage of an ongoing attack, as well as preventive actions.

A few popular knowledge bases describe cyber adversary behavior and provide a common
taxonomy for both offense and defense aimed at enterprise networks: FireEye’s cyber kill chain,4
Lockheed Martin’s cyber kill chain, which is part of their intelligence-driven defense model for
identification and prevention [26], and MITRE ATT&CK [63], which maintains a taxonomy for
multiple platforms and networks (enterprise, mobile, and industrial control systems). However,
no well-defined knowledge base aggregates all information regarding the threat components and
provides a taxonomy for the different stages of attacks in the field of transportation and avionics.
In this paper, we address this gap by providing a broad overview of avionics systems, emphasizing
the security aspects, and presenting a taxonomy of adversarial behavior associated with the
communication, navigation, engagement, surveillance, and complementary systems and devices of
aircraft. Following MITRE ATT&CK’s taxonomies, we have identified specific actions (techniques)
and classified them under categories (tactics) to reflect the various phases of the adversarial attack
lifecycle, and so we proposed an extension of the MITRE taxonomy adapted to aircraft. Moreover,
we present an ontology that defines the entities through which the various threats and actors that
take part in the various attacks can be analyzed.

Since an aircraft is comprised of different communication systems and devices which have diverse
roles in the aircraft’s functionality, we examine aircraft according to their division into the domains
defined by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) of ARINC [2] in the ARINC
Report 821 [5]: the passenger information & entertainment domain (PIESD), passenger-owned
devices domain (PODD), airline information services domain (AISD), and aircraft control domain
(ACD).

Each domain contains its own components and processes, since an aircraft’s various networks
differentiate between different degrees of data sensitivity and logical responsibilities. Therefore,
the adversaries’ degree of influence depends on their presence. This division of domains can be
used to isolate the weak points that can be used to spread between the domains. After performing
this mapping and defining the avionics assets consisting of the various networks and components,
we mapped the various attacks and threats that can be applied to them and analyzed them using
the STRIDE [60] threat model, the attacker’s capabilities, and the potential impact.

Table 1 compares our study to recent studies ([11, 14, 31, 51, 61, 62]) that analyze threats to
various aviation systems. To summarize, our contributions in this study are as follows: First, we
provide a broad overview of modern aircraft, covering their systems, domains, and networks, and
emphasize their security gaps and known attack vectors and threats. Second, we map the different
attacks, and their required capabilities, targets, and threat categories. Third, we provide a taxonomy
that categorizes adversarial behavior targeting different attack surfaces and systems of aircraft;
thus, we extended the MITRE taxonomy for the aviation field. Finally, we present a test case of a
cyber attack and demonstrate how it can be analyzed using the taxonomy.

2 Threat Analysis
Our security analysis is performed according to the ontology presented in Figure 1, which is based
on the NIST ontology for evaluating enterprise security risk. The threat analysis ontology includes
the following entities:

• Threat Actor. An individual, group, or state responsible for an event or incident that impacts,
or has the potential to impact, the security or safety of an aircraft system. Threat actors possess
different adversarial capabilities and therefore may execute different attack techniques.

• Threat. A threat represents a potential violation of a security property, such as integrity, confi-
dentiality, or availability. In a threat, an attacker exploits a vulnerability in order to perform an
attack. In this paper, we opt to use STRIDE threat model to identifying security threats.

• Adversarial Capabilities. Refers to the capabilities that are available to the threat actor. Within
the context of aviation, we distinguish between access, positional, knowledge and material
capabilities.

• Vulnerability. A characteristic of an asset or technology that makes it prone to an attack.
• Operational Impact. The operative effect for which an attack was executed.
• E-Enabled Domains. A division of different communication systems and devices the aircraft is

comprised of, which have diverse roles in an aircraft’s functionality.

• Target Assets. The main data, systems, components, processes, and services that comprise an

aircraft system and should be protected.

• Aviation Tactics. Refers to the adversary’s tactical goal: the reason for performing an action.
• Attack Technique. An act or method that can be used by threat actors to realize threats.
• Sub-Techniques. A more specific description of the adversarial behavior used to achieve a goal.
In this work we opt to consider this as a description of a concrete attack which was implemented
by at least one party.

111:4

Habler, et al.

• Procedures. The specific details of how an adversary carries out a technique to achieve a tactic.
Since it is not yet possible to refer to specific groups which executed attacks, the procedures in
this work are references to academic works or practical threats presented in the industry.

Fig. 1. Threat analysis ontology.

In order to analyze the threat model and define a taxonomy for attacks in the aviation field, we

performed the following steps:

First, we performed a broad review of the various avionics systems, communication networks,
and the back-end components that comprise the aircraft’s complete assembly. This review was
carried out by examining the e-Enabled domains in order to identify the various target assets
(Sections 3 - 5). Second, for each asset we mapped the threats and concrete attacks that were carried
out on it (detailed in Section 7) in order to identify its inherent vulnerabilities.
Third, we analyzed the various attacks using the STRIDE threat model and mapped the threat
actors(Section 6.1), while identifying the various adversarial capabilities that are required in order
to implement the attacks carried out (Section 6.2).
Fourth, we analyzed the concrete attacks carried out in academia and industry and distilled from
them the sub-techniques that were used to carry out the various attacks, summarized in Table 3).
Finally, through these mappings of the potential threat actors, their capabilities, and the concrete
attacks that were carried out in industry and academia, we defined taxonomy for the aviation field,
organized as an extension of the MITRE framework (Section 8). Our proposed taxonomy is defined
by abstracting the different concrete attacks and techniques used by the attackers and defining
them as a means to achieve a goal as part of a multi-stage attack. A demonstration for modeling
the proposed taxonomy framework is presented in Section 9.

3 The Target Assets of an Aircraft System
In the last decade, the architecture of avionics and information systems in aircraft has evolved and
developed to enable real-time data links between aircraft and the ground for information sharing,
i.e., passing critical control, maintenance, navigation, and operations data. There was also a need
to reduce the weight of computer and network infrastructure on aircraft to reduce the cost of
fuel. This was achieved by consolidating a number of software systems on integrated modular

avionics (IMA) computing modules capable of supporting numerous applications and transitioning
to Ethernet-based protocols and networks (and more specifically to Avionics Full-Duplex Switched
Ethernet, defined in the ARINC-664 report [4]).

Aircraft systems like passenger engagement systems and critical navigation systems have differ-
ent roles, and levels of importance and sensitivity. Therefore, the target assets of aircraft systems
are divided into three e-Enabled domains (see Figure 2): the Aircraft Control Domain (ACD), Airline
Information Services Domain (AISD), and Passengers (PIESD and PODD).

Fig. 2. e-Enabled aircraft domains.

In this section, we briefly describe each of the aircraft e-Enabled domains, analyze the various
target assets which are part of each domain, and analyze the connectivity between different domains.
Figure 3 illustrates the various systems that communicate with the aircraft, their location, and
means of communication; Figure 4 illustrates the different avionics assets, categorized according to
their purpose and infrastructure.

Habler, et al.

Fig. 4. Categorization of Air/Ground avionics systems - Navigation systems, Entertainment systems, Surveil-
lance systems, Information systems, Communication systems and Maintenance systems.

3.1 Aircraft Control Domain (ACD)
The ACD consists of the systems and networks responsible for the aircraft’s safe operation, e.g., air
traffic control (ATC) and aircraft operational control (AOC) communications. Therefore, the ACD
has the most stringent security requirements. The ACD contains two subdomains: the Cabin-Core
and the Flight and Embedded Control System. The Cabin-Core is designed to provide the services
required to operate the cabin components, such as public address systems, smoke detectors, and air
conditioning. The Flight and Embedded Control System is designed to allow the pilot to control the
aircraft from the flight deck.

To communicate with on-ground services, the aircraft use different components such as opti-
cal diodes and electronic gateway modules. Sometimes, these components are the same as the
components that serve the passenger domains; thus the separation between domains is not absolute.
There are a large number of critical systems used by the aircraft during flight. We mapped the
main systems according to the nature of their function: surveillance, communication, emergency
avoidance, system updates, navigation, entertainment, and auxiliary (this mapping is illustrated in
Figure 4).

Surveillance and Information Systems

3.1.1
The surveillance systems are responsible for proactive, comprehensive monitoring of the aircraft
location, while the information systems are responsible for supporting the aircraft operators and
providing aeronautical information.
• ADS-B system: Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) is a satellite-based,
‘radar-like’ system designed to continuously derive the aircraft position from the global navigation
satellite (GPS) system. ADS-B provides the aircraft’s position and velocity with high accuracy,
providing a clearer picture of the air traffic than traditional radar systems. ADS-B includes two
separate systems: ADS-B In and ADS-B Out. The ADS-B In system allows an aircraft to receive
and display messages transmitted by other aircraft within the receiving range. The ADS-B Out
system allows an aircraft to continuously generate and broadcast messages over an unencrypted
L-band range of frequencies. There are several types of certified ADS-B data links, but the
preferred international link operates at 1090 MHz. Each ADS-B report may contain the following
aircraft attributes: ICAO code (unique identifier), time, longitude, latitude, altitude, and velocity.
• FIS-B: Flight Information System Broadcast (FIS-B) is a service that operates along with the
ADS-B system to allow aircraft operators to obtain aeronautical information (e.g., temporary

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

111:7

flight restrictions and weather reports). FIS-B data is transmitted from ground stations to the
aircraft’s ADS-B receiver, which is responsible for processing the data and displaying a graphical
national weather service data and flight restrictions on cockpit displays.

• TIS-B: Traffic Information Services-Broadcast (TIS-B) is another service that operates with the
ADS-B system. TIS-B is a surveillance service which uses the ADS-B ground stations and radar
data to transmit aircraft position data to aircraft cockpit displays. Using TIS-B, the air traffic
controller can share information regarding nearby aircraft with the pilot.

• PSR: Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) is a surveillance radar system that does not require
any onboard equipment to locate aircraft. PSR uses a radar antenna to emit a radio wave pulse.
When directed at an aircraft the wave is reflected, and the resulted energy is returned back to
the PSR antenna. By analyzing the reflected pulse, the system can infer the range and bearing
of the aircraft with respect to the antenna position. Since the PSR does not consist of onboard
components, it does not represent an avionics asset for the purposes of our research and therefore
we will not expand on it further in this paper.

• SSR: Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) is a surveillance radar system which uses transmitters
and transponders as interrogators. The SSR radar antenna transmits a pulse which is received by
onboard transponder. The transponder returns a reply that contains information regarding the
aircraft state (e.g., identity code, aircraft’s altitude).

• MLAT: Multilateration (MLAT) is a technology that is used for navigation and surveillance. MLAT
uses a methodology of analyzing a signal’s time difference of arrival (TDOA) using multiple
sensors in fixed locations, to infer the aircraft transmitter location. In aviation, MLAT is used by
many stakeholders (e.g., live flight trackers) to track aircraft location.

3.1.2 Emergency Avoidance Systems
Emergency avoidance systems are designed to issue an alert when there is a critical failure (e.g.,
engine failure), increase cockpit awareness of nearby aircraft, and serve as the last defense against
mid-air collisions.
• TCAS/ACAS X: The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) is designed to issue alerts and
prevent mid-air collisions. The TCAS uses an onboard surveillance system to interrogate the
airspace around an aircraft for other aircraft equipped with an active corresponding transponder
(Mode-S transponder). The transponder is used to transmit signals indicating the aircraft’s
position, altitude, and vertical speed. The TCAS consists of two antennas, one of which is loated
on top of the fuselage, and other of which is located on the bottom of the fuselage; then the
aircraft monitored appears on the navigation display. By analyzing the replies from nearby
aircraft, the TCAS can predict a potential collision, raise an alert regarding a potential intruder (a
nearby aircraft), and request a resolution advisory (manoeuvre instruction to prevent collision)
for both of the aircraft. In the last decade, the FAA has funded research aimed at developing a
modern approach to collision avoidance—a collision avoidance system known as ACAS X, which
will use dynamic programming and provide more accurate alerts; in addition, ACAS X aims to
support aircraft equipped with just passive surveillance mechanisms.

• Engine alerting system: The engine alerting system enables the flight crew to visualize the
engine parameters and faults. There are two commonly used systems for engine alerting: The
Engine-Indicating and Crew-Alerting System (EICAS) is an implementation of an engine alerting
system. The EICAS consists of two monitors, two computers, and a display select panel. The
monitors are used to display engine status and maintenance information, the display select panel
enables the pilot to determine which of the two computers provides the engine information to
the monitors, as one of the computers provides data and the other one serves as a standby. When
an engine failure occurs, the system alerts the pilot, and the parameters of the event are recorded

111:8

Habler, et al.

so they can be analyzed afterward by relevant experts. While the EICAS is mainly deployed on
Boeing aircraft, the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) is the corresponding system
deployed on Airbus aircraft. The main difference between the EICAS and ECAM is that ECAM
lists the actions required to deal with a failure.

3.1.3 Navigation Systems
The navigation systems are designed to assist navigation throughout all phases of the flight, from
takeoff to landing. These systems operate in different terrain conditions and at different distances
from the ground.
• GNSS and augmentation systems: The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) refers to a
constellation of satellites providing signals from space that transmit positioning and timing data
to GNSS receivers. The receivers then use this data to determine the position and velocity of the
aircraft. In the aviation field, GNSS is used as a necessary utility in different systems, e.g., the
ADS-B system uses GNSS to provide aircraft positions to ATC.
(1) ABAS is an augmentation system that integrates the information obtained from the GNSS

with information available on board the aircraft.

(2) GBAS is an augmentation system that that provides integrity monitoring using data obtained

from ground sensors.

(3) SBAS is an augmentation system that improves the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of the

GPS signal, using a number of geostationary satellites that cover vast areas.

• Ground-based navigation systems: There are four main kinds of ground-based navigation

systems:
(1) ILS - The instrument landing system (ILS) is a ground-based radio navigation system that
provides short-range precision guidance to an aircraft approaching a runway with complex
visibility conditions affected by light or weather. The ILS uses very high frequency (VHF)
electromagnetic waves to provide horizontal guidance and ultra high frequency (UHF) electro-
magnetic waves to provide vertical and range guidance. The main components of ILS are the
localizer, glide slope, and marker beacons.

(2) VOR system - The VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) is a ground-based navigation aid
system operating in the VHF band. An aircraft equipped with a VOR receiver can determine its
clockwise bearing from magnetic north, with reference to the ground station, by transmitting
VHF navigation signals at radial angles

(3) DME system - Distance measuring equipment (DME) is a form of ground-based radio naviga-
tion aid that uses interrogation to compute the distance between an aircraft and ground DME
equipment. The aircraft transmits a signal which is returned by the DME ground equipment
after a fixed delay. The aircraft’s distance from the ground equipment can be measured based
on the delay of the returned signal perceived by the aircraft’s DME equipment.

(4) NDB system - The non-directional radio beacon (NDB) is a ground-based navigation aid
system which, in contrast to the VOR system, does not include inherent directional information.
The NDB signals follow the curvature of the Earth, and thus they can be received from much
greater distances at lower altitudes. NDB requires knowledge of the aircraft’s exact heading to
provide high accuracy, while VOR does not.

3.2 Airline Information Services Domain (AISD)
The AISD provides different types of services for non-essential/third-party applications, e.g., com-
puting power, data storage, and routing. Independent aircraft applications such as avionics, in-flight
entertainment, flight crew, and flight attendant applications use the AISD for connectivity purposes.
The AISD contains two subdomains: the Administrative and Passenger Support subdomains. The

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

111:9

Administrative subdomain is designed to provide the flight deck and cabin with operational and
administrative information. The Passenger Support subdomain is designed to provide information
to the passengers.

• EFB: The EFB (electronic flight bag) server is a highly customizes and flexible component of
the aircraft, which is used for information management. The EFB is connected to most of the
aircraft’s avionic systems and sensors via dedicated interfaces (e.g., ARINC 615 and ARINC 429).
Traditionally, Class 3 EFB systems are installed as aircraft equipment that includes an EFB server
and a dedicated multi-function display. In recent years, pilots have started using portable and
commercial tablets provided by the airlines as an extension to the EFB (Considered as Class 2
EFB systems).5 Class 2 EFB systems usually contain applications that are complementary to the
services provided by the EFB, such as calculation of the take-off data.

3.3 Passenger Domain (PIESD)
The passenger domain can be divided into two subdomains: Passenger Information & Entertainment
Services Domain (PIESD) and Passenger Owned Devices Domain (PODD). The PIESD is designed
to serve the passengers, providing them with Internet and entertainment services. In addition
to traditional entertainment systems, this domain allows access to wireless networks, links to
passengers’ physical devices, and seat adjustments. The PIESD also connects passengers with the
flight information system. The PODD consists of external devices that passengers bring on board.
To connect these external devices to the aircraft system, a passenger has to go through the PIESD.

• IFEC system: The in-flight entertainment and communication (IFEC) system refers to the
entertainment applications available to passengers during flight (e.g., TV, audio, Wi-Fi, maps,
and games). The IFEC includes content communication systems from external providers that
are designed to enable telephony, satellite, and Internet services. These systems usually include
display screens, computers with Linux/Windows/Android operating systems, and hosting/storage
servers.

4 Domain Connectivity
The aircraft networks include overlapping components and networks that may allow attackers to
move between the domains and components. Therefore, to defend against an attacker’s trying to
spread within the aircraft network, there is great value in locating potential areas that an attacker
can exploit for lateral movement.

Figure 5 illustrates the division into the different domains, their backend components, and
the components that link them. A red dot marks the overlapping components between the grids.
Moreover, the figure contains the means of communication between the different domains to the
providers.

4.1 PIESD and AISD Connectivity
The core network cabinet is responsible for data segregation between the PIESD, AISD, and ACD.
The core network cabinet consists of several components, i.e., Ethernet gateway module (EGM), the
controller server module (CSM), and the crew information system/maintenance system (CIS-MS)
file server module (FSM). These components are intended to provide cabin services, but they must
be able to access the AISD for this purpose.

• The EGM includes an Ethernet switch and router for managing the PIESD and AISD connectivity.

111:10

Habler, et al.

Fig. 5. E-enabled implementation - system and component connectivity. The figure highlights the backend
components that comprise the various domains; overlapping components are marked with a red circle.

• The CSM utilizes a dual connection, providing network management services (e.g., DHCP and
DNS services) to the PIESD and fault reporting across the AISD and therefore to the ACD which
hosts the maintenance system.

• The CIS-MS FSM is dually connected to provide the ACD/AISD/PIESD systems’ data load services.
These services include file transfer, data retention, wireless device control, and communication
services.

In addition to the core network cabinet, the EFB also connects the networks. The EFB is an electronic
information management device that helps flight crews perform flight management tasks more
easily and efficiently. The EFB is connected to the PIESD and AISD via the AISD switch and the
EGM. This interconnection allows, for example, problem reports to be offloaded from the aircraft in
the event of wireless/broadband satellite, AISD, or PIESD failure, using the e-logbook application
hosted on the EFB.

4.2 AISD and ACD Connectivity
The network interface module (NIM) includes an avionics gateway which provides network address
and protocol translation to connect the AISD to the more secure avionics in the ACD through
the ACD switch. To improve the fault isolation capability of the maintenance system, in case of a
failure of the NIM boundary router and/or the EGM, the following aircraft systems may also be
connected to the ACD switch: The flight data recorder (FDR) and cabin services system (CSS).

• The FDR is an optional server that records high-value data that must be available at all times.
• The CSS has dual connections: the connectivity to the in-flight entertainment (IFE) system enables
information to be presented to and played by passengers, while the connectivity to the ACD and
AISD switches enables the transfer of audio between the pilot and the cabin.

4.3 External Connectivity
Several external connections allow remote access to the aircraft network for the benefit of synchro-
nization, updating information, and maintenance.

(1) Maintenance laptop connectivity is possible using the connectivity and crew wireless LAN unit

thus enabling external components to access the aircraft network.

(2) External flight planning systems can communicate with the aircraft crew via ACARS to update

navigation plans.

(3) External terminals provided by trusted parties can be used for wireless communication with

data-loaders that are used for software updates.

(4) The aircraft terminal wireless LAN unit (TWLU) is used for airport gatelink connectivity,
while the connectivity and crew wireless LAN unit (CWLU) is used for maintenance laptop
connectivity.

(5) the airport wireless network can be used to access devices on the same local area network, and
these components (such as an EFB tablet or passengers’ private devices) can have an impact on
the aircraft.

• Loadable system: A loadable system consists of a loadable replaceable unit (LRU), which is a
modular component that is designed to be replaced quickly, and software that can be transferred
to an LRU to modify system functionality. Software updates are used for a number of purposes:
(1) OPS and OPC: update the operational program software/configuration (the operating system

data and configurations of the LRUs).

(2) Databases: update several databases, e.g., the engine data, flight management computer, and

flight plans.

(3) AMI (airline modifiable information): The AMI defines software generated by the operator to
customize system operations, e.g., customization of the control display unit screens that are
displayed to the flight crew.

The loadable software updates can be transferred to the aircraft using a physical disk or wireless
data loaders (e.g., Teledyne technologies’ LoadStar server).

5 Communication Systems

5.1 SATCOM
The satellite communication system (SATCOM) is used for reliable data and voice communication.
The SATCOM serves as a data link for different uses, such as ADS-B, controller pilot data link
communications (CPDLC), and the ACARS. The SATCOM is comprised of the following components:
(1) Satellite data unit (SDU): the SDU allows air and ground communication via a satellite network.

The SDU uses a radio frequency unit to connect with a satellite.

(2) Low and high gain antennas: The antennas contain an integrated beam steering unit and receive

command information directly from the SDU.

5.2 CPDLC/FANS-1/ATN
The CPDLC provides a means of communication between air traffic controllers and pilots over a data
link system. The CPDLC data link is used to transmit non-urgent strategic messages to an aircraft
and serves as an alternative to voice communications. There are two popular implementations
of the CPDLC data link system: the future air navigation system (FANS-1) and the aeronautical
telecommunication network (ATN) system. FANS-1 is an ACARS-based service that mainly uses
Inmarsat satellite communications services, and the ATN is based on a VHF data link and is mainly
operated by ARINC and SITA.

111:12

Habler, et al.

5.3 ACARS
The aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) is a digital data link system
that enables the transmission of short messages between aircraft and ground stations through
a network of transceivers. ACARS messages are used to communicate with ATC and the base
operational office. This system is most often used for transmitting departure information, weather
information, aeronautical operational control information, and OOOI events ([gate] Out, [wheels]
Off, [wheels] On and [gate] In), which are automatically collected and represent the flight phase
and related information (e.g., amount of fuel). The main components of the ACARS are:
(1) Onboard equipment: The onboard equipment consists of a management unit which interfaces
with flight management systems (FMSs) and a router which enables the aircraft to receive flight
plans and weather information from the ground. The management unit enables the airline to
update the FMS, and the crew can use this information to evaluate alternative flight plans while
in flight.

(2) Ground equipment: The ground equipment consists of networks of radio transceivers managed

by a computer that handles the ACARS messages.

(3) DSP: The communication between the aircraft and the ground is linked via a data link managed

by a datalink service provider (DSP); SITA and ARINC are the two primary providers.

6 Adversaries and Threat Analysis

6.1 Threat Actors
There is a wide range of possible adversaries; each type of adversary has a different motivation,
purpose, and means at their disposal to achieve their goals. In this section, we review the different
types of adversaries and their motives. We consider an adversary as any individual or group who
is trying to attack an airborne system in order to violate the security and proper functioning of
the aircraft, We divided the adversaries into six tiers of based on their capabilities, potential for
harm, and available resources. Adversaries strive to achieve diverse goals, which are illustrated in
Figure 6.
(1) Tier 1: ‘Lone Wolves’ are individuals who possess limited capabilities, knowledge, and tech-
niques that are available on the internet. They are motivated by the possibility of gaining
publicity, fame, or financial reward.

(2) Tier 2: Criminals are individuals or teams of people who use technology to commit malicious
activities on digital systems or networks in order to steal sensitive corporate data or personal
information for profit.

(3) Tier 3: Hacktivists and unorganized crime groups are more advanced adversaries greater
resources and knowledge. They are often motivated by political agendas, and their goal is
usually to cause destruction and chaos.

(4) Tier 4: Organized crime groups and cyber mercenaries make up the fourth tier. Organized
crime groups are usually driven by economic motives. These organizations can employ experts
in the required fields and therefore can carry out attacks of a reasonable level of complexity.
Their attacks are usually targeted at extortion and often include the threat of data disclosure
or encryption using ransomware. Cyber mercenaries, employed by hostile stakeholders, may
try to steal information or damage property. This can be achieved by stealing commercial or
technological information or by compromising a company’s reputation.

(5) Tier 5: State-sponsored organizations form this tier of adversaries who represent the first
level of so-called advanced persistent threats (APT). Such organizations are military organiza-
tions or technology groups funded by governments that aim to build strategic capabilities and
increase accessibility to a wide range of targets. These organizations have unlimited resources

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

111:13

and can devote significant time and high-quality human resources to gain powerful capabilities.
The targets of these organizations are carefully chosen, and their goals include delivering threat
signals, causing operational and financial damage, causing denial of service or sowing fear.
(6) Tier 6: Intelligence agencies comprise the most advanced of the threat actor group. These
adversaries have the offensive capabilities of a country’s cyber military. Like tier 5 threat actors,
they have the most advanced capabilities and unlimited resources. Their goals range from
gathering intelligence and business information to causing actual damage.

Fig. 6. Primary adversaries and their goals.

6.2 Adversary Capabilities

Fig. 7. Adversarial capabilities.

To better understand the capabilities required to implement the various attacks, we analyze
the different adversarial capabilities (denoted as AC) adversaries need to execute various attacks.
After examining the existing attacks on the multiple systems, we then classified the adversaries’
capabilities based on the type of attack the capabilities facilitate. Figure 7 illustrates the division of
the capabilities into groups.
(1) RF - Signaling capabilities

Radio frequency (RF) signaling refers to the capability of generating an electromagnetic signal,
can be used as a type of communication. Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation
with identified radio frequencies that range from 3 kHz to 300 GHz. RF communication is one
of the primary means by which an aircraft communicates with its surroundings and ground
stations. Therefore, the attacker’s ability to transmit signals over specific ranges allows him/her
to communicate and influence different systems.
• AC1 - Transmit HF signals: An adversary can operate in high frequency band (3-30 MHz),
which is used by international shortwave radio stations in aviation communication. The HF

Habler, et al.

system on an aircraft enables two-way voice communication with ground stations or other
aircraft and provides digitally coded signals for such communication.
• AC2 - Transmit VHF signals: An adversary can operate in very high frequency band (30-300
MHz). Different systems use the frequencies in this range; For example, in aviation, the range of
108–118 MHz is used by the VOR, and the ILS localizer as air navigation beacons, while 118–137
MHz is used as airband for air traffic control, and 121.5 MHz serves as an emergency frequency.
• AC3 - Transmit L-band signals: An adversary can operate at the L-band (1-2 GHz), which is
the top end of the ultra high frequency (UHF) band. The L-band is used by various aircraft
systems, e.g., the ADS-B, TCAS, and DME.
• AC4 - Adjust signal response: The ability to sync the response to interrogations or adjust
transmission rate. This capability is required to influence systems that depend on the signal’s
time of arrival to determine the transmitter’s location.
• AC5 - Signal absorption and processing: The adversary’s ability to pick up, listen to, and decode
signals using appropriate hardware (receivers), processors, and parsers (e.g., OpenSky data
tools6 for processing ADS-B traffic).

(2) Positioning capabilities

The adversary’s position in relation to the attacked aircraft is significant in terms of the
attacker’s ability to carry out the different attacks. This importance derives from the systems’
mode of operation, the degree of absorption, and the distance at which the threat actor operates.
Moreover, an adversary’s location directly impacts the attack duration and accuracy, as the
aircraft is not a static target.
• AC6 - On ground: An adversary located on the ground is limited in his/her ability to perform
a prolonged attack on an object moving at high speed and high altitude. Ground attacks have
the advantage of affecting a defined area.
• AC7 - On board: An adversary located on board has a high degree of destructive potential
and long-term impact on the aircraft given his/her physical access to a variety of components.
However, attackers are limited in terms of the means and tools that they can bring on board to
perform the attack, and the degree of difficulty in concealing them is not trivial.
• AC8 - Proximate to flying aircraft: Proximity to the aircraft during flight enables the execution
of attacks that depend on close distance to the aircraft (e.g., TCAS spoofing and jamming).
• AC9 - Proximate to the runway: Proximity to the runway is required to cause interference
during the aircraft’s landing and take-off (e.g., Proximity to the runway is required for the aim
of abusing the ILS whose operation activates upon the landing phase). The risk inherent in
runway proximity is the high chance of being caught due to the presence of security personnel,
identification systems, etc.
• AC10 - Proximate to the ground station: Proximity to the ground station can enable the disrup-
tion of frequencies near the station and facilitate impersonation attacks by taking advantage of
the physical proximity to a legitimate station.
• AC11 - Geographically distributed: A decentralized adversary can perform a synchronized
attack in several places at a coordinated time or simultaneously in order to affect a target or a
comprehensive area partition. For example, using the multilateration concept, an adversaries
can execute spoofing of GPS signals while they are distributed between different areas.
• AC12 - Operate unmanned aerial vehicle: Similar to the AC8 capability, operating an unmanned
aerial vehicle enables proximity to an aircraft during flight. This route to proximity has several
advantages, e.g., it reduces the adversaries exposure.

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

111:15

(3) Device intervention capabilities

Device intervention refers to the ability to affect components and systems on the aircraft
through direct or indirect access for the purpose of disrupting or injecting malicious payloads
or backdoors.
• AC13 - Supply chain: The ability to influence the supply chain of various technologies in
aircraft in order to introduce infected components. This attack has vast potential for damage, and
its implementation requires extensive knowledge of deployment and procurement processes.
• AC14 - Physical access to passenger’s device: Accessibility to passenger’s devices can be used
in order to harm components in the PIESD and PODD (e.g., the IFEC system).
• AC15 - Physical access to cabin devices: Accessibility to devices within the cabin can be used
in order to harm components in the PIESD and AISD (e.g., the FDR).
• AC16 - Physical access to crew devices: Accessibility to the crews’ devices can be used in order
to harm components in the AISD and ACD (e.g., the EFB).

(4) Prior knowledge capabilities

Prior knowledge is a prerequisite for targeted attacks; gaining information about an aircraft
and its trajectory can highly influence how successful and effective an attack can be.
• AC17 - Public sky scanners: Access to public databases and scanners, such as OpenSky Network
and Flightradar24, enables access to real-time and historical information regarding flight routes
and aircraft themselves.
• AC18 - Obtain ICAO address: Aircraft are assigned a unique ICAO 24-bit address upon national
registration, which becomes a part of the aircraft’s certificate of registration. Since this address
normally never changes, obtaining this information allows an adversary to target a specific
aircraft and track its route.
• AC19 - Obtain manufacturer and model information: Obtaining information concerning the
aircraft manufacturer and model can provide the adversary with details regarding the versions
of aircraft components and the technologies deployed. An adversary can use such information
to detect attack surfaces and design the most suitable vector to achieve its goals.
• AC20 - Flight’s approach route: Obtaining the flight’s approach route and the flight plan of a
targeted aircraft can help an adversary determine the best location to carry out an attack. This
type of information is necessary for the interference with the landing phase (e.g., ILS spoofing,
and GBAS).

(5) Wireless communication capabilities

Aircraft systems communicate remotely with satellites and ground stations. To access these
systems, an adversary must possess the ability to communicate via wireless communication.
• AC21 - Control/own GSM tower: Owning a GSM tower (e.g., cell tower) is required for cellular
communication with third-party service providers and onboard systems (e.g., IFEC).
• AC22 - Communicate with an onboard device using Wi-Fi: Gaining Wi-Fi capabilities can be
used for communicating of onboard devices and even affect them; e.g., Wi-Fi vulnerabilities
can be used to spread between devices connected to the same Wi-Fi network. For instance, the
airport Wi-Fi network can be used as an attack surface to infect pilots’ and crew’s devices (e.g.,
the EFB terminal).
• AC23 - Communicate with an onboard device using Bluetooth: Similar to AC22, an adversary
can use Bluetooth exploits to infect nearby components (e.g., passengers’ cellular devices).
• AC24 - Communicate with an onboard device using mobile communications: Using cellular
communications, an adversary can maintain continuous communication with components on
the aircraft using mobile-satellite services (e.g., Viasat and Intelsat).

(6) Satellite capabilities

Capabilities dealing with satellites are often powerful capabilities associated with state or

111:16

Habler, et al.

military entities. The use of satellite capabilities can provide a wide range of attack surfaces
and facilitate complex attacks that require high transmission intensities.
• AC25 - Control/own satellite: An adversary controlling a satellite can obtain accurate informa-
tion from a wide geographical surface. In addition, such control provides the ability to transmit
powerful signals in order to disrupt communication channels and give inaccurate information
to different stakeholders (e.g., aircraft, and ground stations).
• AC26 - Control state/military satellite transmitter: A powerful GPS transmitter can be used
for GPS spoofing and jamming attacks. Moreover, the military SATCOM transmitter provides
secure and reliable connectivity, and can reach a wide range using strong amplifiers.
Table 2 provides a comparison of the different tiers of threat actors based on their feasibility of
acquiring different capabilities to implement an attack. The index is the degree of likelihood of
possessing a capability which ranges from certian feasibility to improbable feasibility.

7 Concrete Avionics Attacks
In this section, we review existing cyber attacks on the various avionics systems, both in academia
and industry.
(1) ADS-B system cyber attacks: The ADS-B system lacks basic security mechanisms such as
authentication, message integrity, and encryption. Because it is used to provide information in real
time, these security gaps make the application of the protocol in crowded skies risky, exposing the
aircraft to different types of attacks. Costin et al. [9] showed that jamming, denial-of-service (DoS),
eavesdropping, spoofing, and impersonation attacks are both easy and practically feasible for a
moderately sophisticated attacker to apply on the ADS-B system. Both FIS-B and TIS-B may be
susceptible to similar attacks, since they are all transmitted over an unauthenticated link and carry
the same data format. The ease with which these attacks can be executed using COTS transponders
has also been described in [15]. A description of attack trees that describe the steps that need to be
taken to implement the various attacks is provided in [70], and attack scenarios are listed in [34].
(2) SSR system cyber attacks: The SSR system is prone to spoofing, jamming, and over-interrogation
and radar loss. A major vulnerability of the SSR system is the ability to compromise its availability,
whether intentionally or unintentionally, by overloading interrogations [61]. As high interrogation
rates can cause transponders to restrict their sensitivity to interrogations and overheat, and result

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

111:17

in radar loss of the target from ATC displays. Moreover, Osechas et al. [39] and Mostafa et al. [37]
both showed that SSR systems are prone to jamming attacks using a high-power transmitter at
frequencies of 1030 MHz for interrogation and 1090 MHz for replies, and introduced and introduced
different scenarios of spoofing attacks, e.g. injecting ghost aircraft into display screens.
(3) MLAT system cyber attacks: As a derivative of the MLAT mode of operation, the MLAT
system is not affected by tampering attacks, since the only necessary information is the signal’s
time of arrival. In contrast, GPS spoofing technique have already been discussed in the literature,
where they were shown to be a potential attack vector of the MLAT system. Moser et al. [36]
demonstrated how a distributed and multi-instrument attacker could disrupt the system and spoof
aircraft positions.
(4) TCAS/ACAS X cyber attacks: The S system is designed to reduce the incidence of mid-air
collisions with other aircraft, therefore an attack that disrupts the system’s operation or gives the
attacker control of the system is a risk to human life. Hannah et al. [24] provided a description of
the general landscape of the S threat actors, their capabilities, and potential attacks. Furthermore,
both the SESAR and NextGen projects, which are the leading modernization efforts in the aviation
industry, plan to implement new operational concepts which will reduce the space between aircraft.
In addition, the FAA has funded research and development on ACAS X, which will likely replace
the S system. Research [58] has shown how ACAS X can be triggered to erode the safety of the
aircraft with the use of expensive equipment and distance constraints. These attacks are difficult to
implement, however they are particularly dangerous because once they have been successfully
implemented, even an experienced pilot will have difficulty identifying the attack [56].
(5) Engine alerting system cyber attacks: The EICAS is used to display engine parameters and
raises alerts regarding configuration or faults. Therefore, exploitation of the EICAS/ECAM system
can be used to manipulate the crew’s behavior and affect the engine. Chris Roberts, a security
researcher, claimed that he was able to spoof EICAS messages using unsupervised access to the
FMS when he was on a flight; his claim was published by Kaspersky Labs [52].
(6) GNSS cyber attacks: As aviation operations increasingly rely on the GNSS to improve nav-
igation performance and support air traffic control surveillance functions, vulnerabilities in it
have the potential to cause widespread damage. Industry and academia have shown how jamming,
intentional disruptions, and spoofing can influence the GNSS by utilizing the frequencies at which
it operates (L1/L2), thus affecting many applications that use satellite information for the purpose of
obtaining precise directions or location. Trufferet al. [68] illustrated how GNSS jamming can affect
the position displayed on the FMS. In addition, Tanil et al. [64] discussed the potentially catastrophic
impact of GNSS spoofing at remote locations, where traditional ILS services are unavailable and
the landing approach depends on Ground-Based Augmentation Systems (GBASs).
(7) Ground-based navigation system cyber attacks:
• The ILS is a radio navigation system that provides short-range guidance to the aircraft, therefore
exploitation of the system requires the attacker to be located near the aircraft, a requirement
that puts the attacker at risk of detection. ILS spoofing was introduced at DEFCON [? ] where it
was shown that a successful attack requires the placement of a powerful antenna in very close
proximity to the airport. There are few examples in the literature of possible wireless attacks on
the ILS, two of which were described in [49]: an overshadow attack and a single tone attack. The
overshadow attack requires the attacker to overpower legitimate ILS signals, which causes the
receiver to process the attacker’s signal. In a single tone attack, an attacker transmits a single
frequency tone signal at a lower strength than the legitimate ILS signal thus interfering with the
original signal. A successful ILS attack can disrupt the aircraft’s ability to land safely and can
therefore result in property damage, injury, and even death.

111:18

Habler, et al.

• The VOR system is prone to jamming and spoofing attacks [7], but with the development of
precision approach systems, the use of non-precision approach systems such as VOR and NDB
has significantly decreased today; therefore the threat posed by attacking this system does not
have the potential for much damage.

(8) IFEC system cyber attacks: The IFEC system is more troublesome in security contexts, as
the system is directly accessible to the passenger and therefore prone to breaches. The IFEC system
contains passengers’ private information, and an adversary exploiting the system can gain control of
the information passengers presented on their in-flight screen. Moreover, the system is connected to
the Wi-Fi network and network controller that connects the PIESD to the ACD network. Exploiting
the IFEC could allow an attacker to pass from the PIESD to more sensitive networks. In [28] and [1],
the researchers showed how the IFEC system’s vulnerabilities can be used to enable the attacker to
pass between networks, access credit card details, and control cabin lighting and smart screens.
(9) SATCOM cyber attacks: The aircraft’s SATCOM system datalink serves multiple systems of
the aircraft’s control and crew devices; the datalink is used for voice and data services, allowing an
aircraft to communicate via satellite. An exploit targeting the SATCOM infrastructure (protocol,
devices, services) can be used to gain remote control of various systems. The severity of SATCOM
exploitation used to access passenger and crew devices was discussed in [48], while Santamarta et
al. [46, 47] described how an adversary can abuse SATCOM terminals to find a backdoor and retrieve
hardcoded credentials. The authors claim that an adversary exploiting SATCOM terminals has the
potential to intercept, manipulate, and block communications, and in some cases, to remotely take
control of the physical device.
(10) CPDLC system cyber attacks: The CPDLC system is unencrypted and therefore does not
meet basic security and privacy requirements. Gurtov et al. [20] analyzed the CPDLC system’s
technical features and properties and divided the possible threat actors into active and passive
threat actors. The authors describe how CPDLC system exploits can be used for eavesdropping,
jamming, flooding, injection, alteration, and masquerading attacks thus enabling an attacker to
gain access and control messages, modify their content, and flood ground stations and aircraft
with ghost messages. Di Macro et al. [12] presented a more sophisticated attack in which CPDLC
systems can be attacked through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack with the use of open-source
tools. In [54], the author expanded on the MITM attack and explained how it can be used to take
over an aircraft’s communications and transmit CPDLC commands without alerting the legitimate
controller. The feasibility of transmitting crafted CPDLC messages was discussed by Eskilsson
in [15].
(11) ACARS cyber attacks: The ACARS was developed with no security measures [57]. In recent
years, several attack scenarios have been demonstrated by both security researchers and hackers
in industry, e.g., in 2012, security researcher Hugo Teso showed how malicious ACARS messages
can be crafted by an adversary and used to control the flight management system and thereby
also control the pilot’s displays and control systems, using just a simple mobile phone [65]. An
introduction to cyber attacks on ACARS was also presented at DEFCON [42]; one of the main
points raised was the threat posed by the existing physical links between the communication
management unit, which is used to route ACARS traffic, and the various avionics systems, whereby
a vulnerability in the ACARS has the ability to affect many other systems. In [44], the European
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) addressed the ACARS cyber security threats, analyzing two
scenarios: weight and balance update events and flight plan update events. The weight and balance
update attack deals with an onground attacker who sends crafted ACARS updated to the aircraft,
which can result in uncontrollable behavior of the aircraft. The flight plan update attack involves
an attacker who transmits falsified flight plan data to a targeted aircraft; in this case, a successful

custom attack requires prior knowledge regarding the aircraft’s route. This type of attack can result
in deviations from the desired route.
(12) Loadable cyber attacks: Aircraft systems can be modified using loadable software; this allows
their configuration to be updated without physical intervention. Modifications and replacements
can be made via remote wireless services or pluggable devices. Security researchers demonstrated
they can interfere with the update process by impersonating a legitimate operator or achieving
unauthorized physical access. With the ability to update loadable software, they showed how the
navigation database [3] on the flight management system can be manipulated, as well as how an
attacker can take control of onboard systems using an AMI wireless data loader [66].
(13) EFB cyber attacks: The EFB connects to multiple systems and has the ability to access those
systems and multiple applications, including: the flight management system, passenger information
list, performance applications, technical logs, weight and balance applications, and flight planning
application. The portable nature of the EFB and its ability to connect to public networks put the EFB
tablet at high risk. For example, exposure to public networks may allow the system to be attacked
through Wi-Fi vulnerabilities [1]. Despite the importance and vulnerability of the system, surveys
show that most airlines do not have a cyber security plan in place for the tablet-based EFB used by
their pilots [29]. An example of attack vectors for connecting the FMS, retrieving sensitive data,
accessing flight planning and navigation applications, and even modifying weight and balance
calculations are presented in [40].

Summarizing the material presented in this section, Table 3 contains a list of the attacks known
to academia and industry with a short description of the sub-technique that was carried out
as part of the attack. We used the STRIDE [53] threat model to group the attacks into different
categories. This model considers six threat categories (spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information
disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privileges). In addition, the table includes references
for academic studies and industry implementations; These are the procedures in which the various
cyber attacks are described and implemented, their required capabilities (listed in Section 6.2),
exploited vulnerabilities, and the identified threat posed by the attack according to the STRIDE
threat model.

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

8 Extending MITRE Framework for Aviation
In order to standardize the knowledge on and understanding of threats to cyber security in the
aviation field, we followed the ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge)
model utilized by MITRE [35] to classify attack tactics, techniques, sub-techniques, and procedures.
The MITRE model systematically explains the adversaries’ actions to be executed in the target
device/system/domain from an adversary’s perspective. MITRE ATT&CK covers the enterprise,
mobile, and industrial control system fields. In this section, we divide existing and possible actions
in the aviation domain into a variety of tactics, techniques, and sub-techniques.
• Tactics represent the "why" of the technique: the the adversary’s tactical goals during an attack.
• Techniques represent "how" an adversary achieves a tactical objective by performing an action.
• Sub-Techniques are more specific descriptions of the adversarial behavior used to achieve a
goal, while techniques represent the broad actions an adversary takes to achieve a tactical goal,
• Procedures procedures are the specific implementation the adversary uses for techniques or
sub-techniques. In this work, a procedure is a reference to the implementation of a technique as
applied in academic studies or in industrial applications.

We opted to align our taxonomy with the ATT&CK model, because the attack sequence diagram
can indicate the adversary’s behavior and capabilities, limitations on how adversaries (or a specific
group/APT) can compromise the system, and the loosely protected systems and connections that
require more rigorous security. Moreover, the matrix representation helped us build a systematic
categorization and taxonomy based on the known attacks and retained the attack phases as a
sequence chart. The matrices in Figure 8 represent the various tactics in the aviation field (columns)
and the techniques used to achieve them (the individual cells).

Fig. 8. Taxonomy - aviation matrix tactics and techniques.

8.1 Reconnaissance
Using the reconnaissance tactic, the adversary tries to gather information, and identify and se-
lect targets. The adversary collects information that can be used to support the targeting and
selection of attack techniques in other phases of the attack lifecycle (i.e., locating potential target
systems/networks for initial access). The adversary can use multiple techniques:
Public sky scanners: The adversary can search for available information using online flight track-
ers (i.e., OpenSky7, Flightradar248). Information about flight plans, both visual flight rules (VFRs)
and instrument flight rules (IFRs), can also be found online using services such as SkyVector.9
PSR interrogation: PSR is the only surveillance sensor used in civil aviation that does not require
any on-board equipment to locate aircraft, therefore an attacker can use PSR equipment to gather
information about the aircraft’s location without any dependence on its components.
SSR interrogation:The ability to use SSR interrogation depends on the components installed on
the aircraft, as the SSR relies on targets equipped with a radar transponder. Civil aircraft may
be equipped with transponders capable of operating in different modes: Mode A equipment only
transmits an identifying code. Mode C equipment automatically obtains the aircraft altitude or
flight level, and Mode S equipment has altitude capability and enables data exchange.
ADS-B absorption: ADS-B is a surveillance technique that relies on aircraft or airport vehicles
broadcasting their identity, position, and other information derived from onboard systems (e.g.,
GNSS). An adversary can capture broadcast ADS-B messages using an ADS-B IN receiver and
obtain information about an aircraft’s GPS location, altitude, ground speed, and more.
ACARS absorption: ACARS data processing can provide an adversary with extensive information
about air traffic control, aeronautical operational management, and airline administrative control,
e.g., route updates, weather updates, and even information about special passengers ("housekeeping
services").
ARINC standards: The adversary can gather supported ARINC standards on avionics, cabin
systems, protocols, and interfaces provided by Rockwell Collins.10
Manufacturer related information: In order to obtain supporting information that can be lever-
aged by the adversary to aid in other attack phases. Collecting information regarding relevant
devices implemented onboard is crucial and can be found on different forums and sites, i.e., the FAA
engineering database [16], specification forums [59], manufacturer specifications11 and patents
(e.g., Boeing’s patent for the e-Enablement network implementation [8]).

8.2 Initial Access
With the initial access tactic, the adversary tries to establish an attack vector by gaining access
to the targeted system/environment. By utilizing all the means of access into the system from
the outside world and public network, there might be various entry vectors for gaining an initial
foothold within an aviation system.
Attack via radio communication: Radio communication refers to ground-based communication
using HF and VHF, to communicate with the aircraft. Utilizing HF, VHF, and L-band communication
to enter the network is convenient for the attacker, since, by using simple COTS, he/she can transmit
at different ranges to the various aircraft systems (ILS, ACARs, VOR, DME, ADS-B, and more). At
the same time, using these means of communication requires the attacker to have a line of sight to
the target being attacked.

Attack from satellite/cellular network: The aircraft systems use satellites for communication
and navigation. For example, Satellite Voice-equipped aircraft can initiate calls using Inmarsat12 or
Iridium13 assigned security phone numbers, and IFEC in-flight Wi-Fi uses a satellite-based Wi-Fi
system (e.g., Viasat14). In addition, air traffic management systems, such as the ADS-B and CPDLC
use satellite data links. To this end, satellite range control can provide a diverse attack surface for
PIESD and ACD networks while controlling a wide geographical area.
Attack from airport network: Aircraft connect to the airports’ wireless networks for mainte-
nance; both wireless and cellular connections can be compromised by adversaries. Examples of
potential devices that can be exploited using wireless vulnerabilities (e.g., KRACK vulnerability [17])
include standalone EFB tablet devices, the aircraft terminal wireless LAN unit (TWLU) used for
airport gatelink connectivity, the connectivity and crew wireless LAN unit (CWLU) used for main-
tenance laptop connectivity, and the wireless dataloaders used for software updates.
Attack from airline network: By penetrating the airline network, an attacker can achieve wide
access to the aircraft it operates while interfering with control, operation, and maintenance pro-
cesses. In addition, an attacker can tamper and interfere with with pilot communication using
systems such as VHF voice CPDLC, and ACARS.
Attack from third-party networks: Many services have access to various systems and different
functions in the aircraft. These services can be used to bypass aircraft systems. Examples of possible
targeted services include maintenance services (e.g., ACT services15), management services (e.g.,
Teledyne), flight-planning services (e.g., Honeywell, Lido), support services (e.g., AMETEC), and
development services (e.g., Keysight).
Insider attacks and human errors: Insider attacks involve both intentional attacks and uninten-
tional mistakes by a human with access to any component of the avionics ecosystem. An insider
can be a crew member, maintenance worker, or any other airport/airline employee. Human errors
and nsider assistance can be used to bypass various security measures and gabin physical access to
components, and they are often leveraged by adversaries as initial access techniques.
Public-facing application: The adversary can exploit a public-facing application that does not
require special access privileges; such applications can be used to seek and obtain access points to
aircraft systems. Examples of potential surfaces are the EFB application server/store, administration
websites, and airline websites.
Supply chain compromise: Supply chains can be used to gain access to platforms around the
world. Devices and software can become compromised if an adversary tampers with the manu-
facturing process of a product by installing a rootkit or hardware-based spying component. The
targeted devices include various sensors, remote data concentrators (RDCs), actuators, cabin devices
(e.g., IFEC cell modems, SATCOM modems, and smart monitors).
Internet accessible devices: An adversary can infect Internet-accessible devices such as an IFEC
content server or maintenance laptop. More sophisticated vectors can target SATCOM antennas, as
illustrated by Santamarta et al. [46].

8.3 Persistence
The persistence tactic aims to allow continuous access to aviation systems. In order to maintain
access in the face of en-route and survive restarts, credential changes, and other interruptions, there
are a variety of actions an adversary can perform, ranging from changing settings to interfering
with system files or hardware.

Habler, et al.

Infected crew device: An adversary can gain access to the aircraft crew’s terminals or their
personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) thus ensuring consistent proximity to the aircraft.
Infected pilot device: Infecting pilot-owned devices, such as the EFB tablet, ensures network
access to the aircraft’s cockpit and core systems and an understanding of the activities of the pilot’s
activities during the flight.
Infected passenger device: Attacking passenger devices allows persistence but only for the
duration of the passenger’s flight. Connectivity to a passenger’s device may allow connectivity to
the cabin systems, particularly the IFEC system and the aircraft’s Wi-Fi network.
Infected aircraft servers and network components: In order to gain access to the aircraft
servers and network components, adversaries can use different techniques seen in the ATT&CK
enterprise taxonomy, for example:
• modify configurations - An adversary can gain access to a system by editing the configuration
file that defines its features. Examples of configuration files in the aircraft core systems include
loadable media CONFIG.LDR and EXCONFIG.LDR files, operation program configuration (OPC)
files, and airline modifiable information (AMI) files.

• modify programs and applications - An adversary can modify a program in order to affect the way
it interacts with other systems and devices. Modified applications can be used to add new logic
that enables persistence on the host device. For example, the EFB device has many applications
(e.g., weight and balance applications, flight planning applications, and performance applications)
that may serve as an attack surface.

• System firmware - Device firmware updates can be delegated using a software update package

provided remotely [27].

• Module firmware - Device firmware such as software-loadables, LRUs and other modular hardware

devices can be install or modified to achieve persistence and provide secret access points.

Infected external communication nodes: An adversary can own an allegedly authorized datalink
by penetrating trusted remote service networks such as the CPDLC provider’s network, including
the ATN network (VHF data link operated by ARINC and SITA) and FANS network (satellite
communications provided by Inmarsat). Moreover, an adversary can launch rogue endpoints, e.g.,
rogue GSM towers that communicate with the IFEC system’s cell modem or a ground station that
transmits FIS-B and TIS-B messages.
Infected HF band: By spoofing over the HF communication range an attacker can maintain
contact with an aircraft at short range.
Infected VHF band: By spoofing over the VHF communication range, an adversary can operate
and affect various systems (e.g., the ILS, DME, and VOR systems)while maintaining a line of sight
to the attacked aircraft.
Infected L-band: By spoofing over the UHF and its upper bound (L-band) communication range,
an adversary can operate and affect satellite-based systems (e.g., the TCAS, ACAS X, and ADS-B
systems) from far away.

8.4 Discovery
In order to gain knowledge on the environment, adversaries use the discovery tactic. This tactic
consists of a collection of techniques designed to allow an attacker to determine the options for
advancing, what measures to take, and how to spread within the network.
Threat intelligence gathering: An adversary can use dedicated search engines (e.g., Shodan16
and Censys17) that gather information about vulnerable devices and networks, in order to identify

16https://www.shodan.io/
17https://censys.io/

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

111:27

exposed critical nodes that are sometimes visible on public networks due to misconfigurations.
Perimeter mapping: Devices’ communication patterns can be discovered using connection enu-
meration. An adversary can use different tools to determine the role of a device on the network
and identify its connections to other systems. Moreover, adversaries may attempt to obtain a list of
different systems and components using network identifiers (e.g., MAC addresses, TTL values). By
obtaining IP addresses and identifying the type of operating system, an adversary can choose how
and where to spread.
LAN communication sniffing (eavesdropping): Adversaries can use sniffing tools in order to
monitor or capture information transmitted through the network, e.g., eavesdrop file transfer
services traffic for discovering data and credentials. Sniffing can also be useful to detect the current
aircraft state by capturing the OOOI events from sensors and gateways.
Wireless communication sniffing (eavesdropping): Adversaries can use the wireless range
to obtain location signals, i.e., Mode-S (1030/1090 MHz frequency) or report ACARS signals at a
frequency of 131.550 MHz.

8.5 Lateral Movement
The lateral movement tactic consists of techniques used by adversaries to spread between compo-
nents in the aircraft. An adversary might want to move between different domains to gain access to
more critical systems, e.g., move from the PIESD to the AISD or ACD. This tactic is usually applied
after performing discovery techniques and identifying a target destination.
Exploit platform and service-specific vulnerabilities: While many components within the
aircraft run popular real-time operating systems (e.g., VxWorks, QNX, ThreadX), significant weak-
nesses are revealed in some of these systems. For example, the Armis Security team has already
identified 11 vulnerabilities (URGENT/11) [50] in the VxWorks OS kernel, e.g., an opcode stack
overflow that can lead to arbitrary code execution. In order to abuse an existing platform, an
adversary can use different utilities in order to inject hooks or abuse API (e.g., Frida18).
Spread between the PIESD and AISD: As described above in Subsection 4.1, there are overlap-
ping connections between both networks (PIESD and AISD). As the AISD contains information
services systems, the attacker can use the AISD network to communicate with third-party providers
for accessibility and information leakage, or as part of further lateral movement to the ACD net-
work.
Spread between the PIESD and ACD: The passengers’ related networks and the control systems
should be separated. However, in practice, there are are overlapping connections between the
networks (e.g., the CSS has dual connections: a connection to the in-flight entertainment system
and a link to the ACD switch designed for transferring audio between the pilot and the cabin.
Spread between the AISD and ACD: As described above in Subsection 4.2, there are overlapping
connections between the networks for non-essential applications (e.g., the cabin services system
and flight deck recorder) ued to connect the cockpit systems to other aircraft systems. In this
way, an adversary that reaches the ACD network can access the core air traffic, information, and
navigation systems.
Spread between the external network and internal network: As described above in Subsec-
tion 4.3, the aircraft serves as a flying domain controller; therefore, it depends on communication
between the ground, its surroundings, and satellites. Thus an attacker can find many access points
from an external network which is accessible from the Internet into an internal network of the
aircraft.

Habler, et al.

Replication through removable media: In order to achieve access to hardened components/net-
works (e.g., air-gapped devices), adversaries may opt to choose the replication through removable
media technique. Aircraft contain different systems with portable USB connections (e.g., cabin pan-
els, smart screens, EFB tablets, and IFEC crew terminals). Shellcode and payloads can be activated
when devices are plugged in, via AutoRun [67].
Exploitation of RDCs: An adversary can abuse RDCs to access controllers, systems, and actuators.
For example, controlling the actuator control electronics unit (ACE) will provide the adversary
with direct control of the flight control surface, by obtaining all inputs and communicating with
the flight computer.

8.6 Command and Control
After initial access to one of the aircraft systems has been obtained, and various types of utilities
(tools and malware) are distributed between the aircraft components, adversaries must establish a
communication channel to command and control the scattered assets. In order to create a stable
method of communication, the attacker will usually try to find a stealthy or seemingly legitimate
method of communication. To achieve this goal, an adversary can abuse communication methods
embedded in the aircraft’s systems (Generalized as Standard Protocol/Datalink Misuse). To apply
this technique, an adversary can utilize aircraft systems and protocols that communicate with the
outside world (e.g., satellites, ground stations, airports, airlines, service providers) to receive or
transmit the information. The following communication methods between air to the ground are
examples of the potential channel that an adversary can use for the use of command and control:
VHF/HF/SATCOM based communication - Used by the ACD as part of the flight and embedded
control systems and cabin systems (e.g., ADS-B, CPDLC, ACARS, and more).
Wireless LAN based communication - Used by the AISD as part of administrative support, flight
support, and maintenance (e.g., communication with airport network).
Broadband/Cellular based communication - Used by the PIESD as part of the in-flight enter-
tainment and passenger internet systems. All these means of communication can allow an adversary
to transmit and receive data via different ranges and accuracy.

8.7 Evasion
The evasion tactic consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection once they have
gained access to the system. Usually this tactic’s techniques require active steps to conceal the
adversary’s presence or to remove evidence.
Display falsified information on panels: Adversaries can modify the content of different panels
(cockpit control panels, crew terminal panels, EFB applications, graphical interfaces) to disrupt the
crew and pilot’s behavior or evade detection.
Suppress alarms: Adversaries may manipulate failure alert systems (e.g., collision or engine failure
alert systems) to avoid the detection of system damage.
Block auxiliary communications: Adversaries can block the CPDLC in order to disable com-
munication between an aircraft and the ground station.
Block sensor data: Adversaries can block sensor or RDC communication to interfere with signals
that indicate the aircraft state.
Spoof/block reporting messages: Adversaries can spoof and block ACARS signals, OOOI events
(engine performance, monitoring, fault reports, fuel status reports, selective calls, passenger ser-
vices, maintenance reports, and other information such as load and balance) to hide actions that
affect the aircraft state [13, 71].
Security audit camouflage: Security audit camouflage refers to any means by which an adver-
sary can remain undetected from audit measures within the systems and software. The following

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

111:29

methods are borrowed from the ATT&CK enterprise framework, as currently there is no evidence
for audit camouflage in avionics systems, but at the same time the actions required for hiding
information are similar:
• Masquerading: Adversaries can use masquerading techniques to disguise a malicious application

or executable as another file (e.g., log files, config files).

• Indicator removal on host: Adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system,

including logs or captured files, in their efforts to cover their tracks.

• Rootkit: Rootkits are programs that hide their existence and the presence of malware by inter-
cepting the operating system’s API calls that supply relevant information. Adversaries can use
rootkits in order to hide their malicious tools and payloads.

• Exploitation for evasion: Adversaries can exploit a software vulnerability to take advantage of an
error in a program or service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself, to evade
detection.

8.8 Impair Supporting Communication
This tactic is an additional to those proposed by ATT&CK. Avionic systems consists of various
communication, navigation, display and management systems integrated in aircraft to perform
individual functions. The proper functioning of these systems depends on continuous operation and
collaboration with external services (e.g., ground stations, satellites, airports, airlines, operators).
As part of a multi-stage attack vector, one of the attacker’s goals will likely be to disrupt such
collaboration and the supporting systems. Some of the collaborations an adversary can disrupt are
presented below:
Between aircraft and ground station - Disrupting ground-based and navigation communication
aids has an impact on the navigation systems, e.g., the DME, VOR, NDB, and ILS.
Between aircraft and ATC - Disrupting communication with ATC ground stations usually refers
to VHF and L-band spoofing or jamming, e.g., interference with ADS-B, FIS-B, TIS-b, SSR interro-
gations. Disruption of these collaborations is of great significance as it affects the perception of the
pilot, crew, and operators regarding the aerial state.
Between aircraft and service providers - Disrupting communication with third-parties providers
(e.g., Inmarsat, Iridium, Viasat, Teledyne, Honeywell, AMETEC, Keysight). This interference has a
great impact on the aircraft’s ability to communicate with the outside world, as satellite services
are deployed by external companies.
Between aircraft and airlines - Disrupting communication channels with airlines, e.g., Airline
Operational Control (AOC) and Airline Administrative Control (AAC) messages.
Between aircraft and satellites - Disrupting satellite communications (SATCOM). This action
can be caused by an adversary who uses powerful transmitter to beam a jamming message towards
the satellite.
Internal aircraft connections - Disrupting the communications between internal systems and
the network that transfer information between them (e.g., by harming the AISD or PIESD switches).

8.9 Impact
As described in Section 6, adversaries have different goals regarding impact. The impact tactic
consists of techniques the adversary uses to disrupt, compromise, destroy, and manipulate the
integrity and availability of an aircraft’s components and systems. While the effect some impact
techniques have on those on the aircraft is less obvious, such techniques can directly affect the
privacy or personal safety of those onboard.
Aircraft tracking: Adversaris can obtain the exact location of the aircraft and follow its route.
Passenger DoS: Adversaries can control cabin operations (e.g., the passenger panels, Wi-Fi, and

111:30

content server).
Dos - Crew : Adversaries can control the IFEC crew terminal, interfering with the cabin crew’s
ability to control the IFEC system.
DoS - Pilot: Adversaries can take control of the cockpit control panels and EFB device to interfere
with the pilot’s ability to make decisions and apply them.
Loss of control: Adversaries can obtain control of different sensors and actuators, which are
crucial for the aircraft’s functionality. For example, gaining access to the ACE component can be
used to achieve full control of actuators and RDCs .
Loss of safety: Adversaries can cause dangerous situations that affect the safety of the passengers
and crew, such as cause landing failure (spoofed/jammed ILS signals [49] or GPS signals [30, 33]),
trigger false TCAS alerts or harm the TCAS system [23, 24, 41], manipulate the engine alerting
system or navigation system, or interfere with the ADS-B surveillance system [9].
Loss of availability: Adversaries may attempt to disrupt essential components or systems to
prevent the proper transfer of information by interfering with the channels used to communicate
with ground stations (e.g., SATCOM/HF/VHF).
Manipulation of view: Adversaries can interfere with the pilot’s view, causing a sustained or
permanent loss of view, by compromising the flight deck instrument display system (EFIS). The
EFIS normally consists of a primary flight display (PFD), multi-function display (MFD), and an
engine indicating display.
Manipulation of control: Adversaries may manipulate the set point values and parameters, such
as the intermediate waypoints in the navigation database. Since waypoints can be used to change
routes, modifying them may affect the flight route.
Isolation from operating factors: Adversaries may aim to interfere with the pilot’s and flight
crew’s ability to receive messages from ground stations and operators in order to ensure their
complete isolation and eliminate their ability to receive guidance or assistance.
Theft of passenger information: Adversaries can exploit IFEC systems to steal passengers’ data
(i.e., credit cards details, passport numbers).
Theft of aircraft statistics: Access to information stored in the aircraft and collected from the
various sensors may be used by adversaries to obtain information about the aircraft’s activity and
be used for a variety of purposes, such as industrial espionage.
Sow fear: Adversaries can take control of the aircraft’s smart monitors and display messages.

9 Demonstration - Modeling the Taxonomy Framework
In this section, we model two attacks according to our proposed taxonomy described in Section 8
and demonstrate how the two examples can be analyzed using the proposed tactics and techniques.

9.1 Case Study - Hacking into the Flight Management System
Hugo Teso demonstrated the following case study at HITBSecConf [65] — hacking into the FMS
using ACARS vulnerability. His experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions using
original components. The attack targeted the onboard FMS component by exploiting its weakness
via the ACARS datalink. Information regarding the target aircraft was collected using the ADS-B
protocol. SIMON is a two-way communication exploitation agent used to inject various payloads
and plugins.
Assumptions:

- The adversary is intentionally trying to influence the FMS.
- The target flight is within the adversary’s line-of-sight.
- The adversary is located on the ground.

We now describing the attack vector step by step following the taxonomy.

Evaluating the Security of Aircraft Systems

111:31

Fig. 9. Exploiting the FMS using ACARS vulnerabilities - modeling taxonomy.

• Reconnaissance - Hugo used the ADS-B protocol (ADS-B absorption) to obtain information
about the aircraft in the area; the data was obtained using a receiver and public sky scanners (e.g.,
Flightradar24, OpenSky Network). Additional information such as flight plans and route clearance
information were obtained using ACARS absorption. Finally, to perform this research, construct
his lab, and gather accurate data, Hugo acquired the Honeywell FMS and Teledyne ACARS from
eBay19; therefore he was able to obtain manufacturer-related information.
• Initial Access - Since the attacker utilizes SDR to craft and transmit ACARS signals towards
the targeted aircraft, we can conclude that the initial access is achieved through the radio access
network. Furthermore, Hugo mentioned that by using an SDR, he was able to target nearby aircraft
and gain control of third-party networks that provide ACARS services (i.e., SITA and ARINC),
• Persistence - With regard to persistence, Hugo kept transmitting ACARS messages and spoofed
the VHF band in order to continue with the attack immediately after installing the initial payload
with an exploitation agent (denoted as SIMON).
• Discovery - After installing SIMON, Hugo obtained two-way link communication with the
aircraft, which enabled him to use perimeter mapping and LAN communication sniffing to find
connected components that may be vulnerable.
• Lateral Movement - The first movement from the ground to the aircraft took place by spreading
from the external network to the internal network (e.g. communicate through providers network
with components within the ACD network). Further movement requires the exploitation of plat-
forms and service-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., ACARS vulnerabilities). In order to perform these
exploitations, Hugo used reverse engineering tools and studied real-time OSs that the FMS deploys
(VxWorks and DeOS).
• Command and Control - In order to communicate with SIMON, Hugo set up a two-way
communication link over ACARS. By doing so, he could upload new plugins and script. The only
constraint is that each ACARS message can only contain up to 220 characters and the ACARS
management unit can transmit 16 subsequent messages at a time.
• Evasion - As SIMON is not designed as a rootkit, alarm suppression and security audit camouflage
are necessary in order to keep the autopilot active so the attacker remains stealthy and in control.
• Impair Supporting Communications - As Hugo interfere with the ACARS communication,
he managed to disrupt the communication between the aircraft and ATCs, ground stations, and
service providers.

Habler, et al.

• Impact - By controlling the FMS, an adversary can communicate with engine and fuel systems,
navigation receivers, surveillance systems, and flight controls. Therefore, tampering with the data
-n the FMS or damaging it has destructive potential, threatening aircraft safety and aircraft control.

9.2 Case Study - Spoofing Ghost Aircraft using ADS-B

Fig. 10. Consistent injection of ghost aircraft - modeling taxonomy.

The ADS-B system is prone to spoofing, flooding, tampering and eavesdropping attacks as

described at various works (e.g., [9, 15, 34, 70]).
Assumptions:

- The adversary intentionally tries to influence the information obtained on a particular flight.
- The target flight is in the adversary line-of-sight.
- The adversary located on the ground.

We now model the ghost-aircraft attack vector step by step following the taxonomy. The taxonomy
matrix applied on this case study is illustrated in Figure 10.
• Reconnaissance - To obtain information about the latest aerial state, the aircraft positions,
exact coordinates, and altitude of the targeted aircraft, an adversary needs the ability to analyze
the ADS-B signals (ADS-B absorption) using the ADS-B IN receiver or public sky scanners (e.g.,
Flightradar24, OpenSky Network).
• Initial Access - Since the attacker utilizes the ADS-B OUT transmitter/Mode S transmitter
to transmit ADS-B signals towards the targeted aircraft, it can be concluded that initial access is
achieved through the radio access network or the L-band.
• Persistence - For persistence, the adversary has to continuously spoof the L-band with ADS-B
messages in the range of absorption of the ADS-B IN receiver on the target.
• Discovery - Although the adversary does not have to advance to any network, to get an idea of
his/her broadcasts’ visibility, the adversary can process his/her signals using a receiver and view
their appearance. To do so, the adversary has to eavesdrop on the L-band. In addition, the adversary
must monitor air traffic and ensure that his/her broadcasts correspond with the flight paths in the
area and nearby aircraft.
• Lateral Movement - The adversary affects the information spread in the internal systems of
the aircraft while communicating with the aircraft from the outside; therefore the adversary affects
onboard devices from an external network.
• Command and Control - The adversary abuses the standard protocol (ADS-B) by transmitting
messages that meet the requirements of the protocol in the appropriate range. Therefore the attack
is an ADS-B based attack.
• Evasion - The attack does not include an evasion attempt.
• Impair Supporting Communications - As the adversary is on the ground, there is a possibility
that the malicious transmissions will be received by ADS-B ground stations; this would allow the
attacker to disrupt the channel between the ground station and the aircraft.
• Impact - As the adversary tampers with the data displayed on the aircraft and ground station
panels, he/she is therefore manipulating the view.

10 Scientific Gaps and Research Directions
This section deals with the scientific gaps and subjects requiring further investigation identified
in our work. We also discuss issues arising from the lack of complete and reliable information
available in the field of offensive cyber security and suggest directions for further research.

(1) Verification of Questionable Information Research on offensive cyber security, especially
when critical systems are involved, is challenging, since in many cases the complete details and
data on an attack method cannot be disclosed or published due to censorship, security concerns,
and other constraints. Therefore, it is important to note that some of the attacks mentioned in the
paper were presented at various conferences without sufficient evidence. In addition, there are
several cases where the veracity of claims is questionable, e.g., avionics experts dispute a security
researcher’s claim that they accessed in-flight entertainment and flight systems from their seat on
an aircraft [18]. Therefore, in order to confirm some of the attack vectors presented, additional
experiments should be conducted.
(2) Scientific Gaps In the field of avionics, there are several scientific gaps and areas where there
is insufficient knowledge and understanding. In the case of avionics, this lack of understanding
poses a real danger, and there is a need for further research to reduce threats to aircraft and those
aboard them.
• Protection Methods Many studies have addressed the need for protection against attacks
on specific systems. The solutions proposed generally require redesigning the system or its
components, adding components or sensors, etc. However, there is a need for a solution that takes
a wide view of an aircraft as a broad and uniform computerized platform with many intrusion
surfaces. The practice of utilizing many systems on an attack vector has hardly been examined.
In this paper, we show how different systems and components can be used throughout the stages
of attacks to achieve the adversary’s desired impact.

• Adoption and Adaptation of Existing Solutions The computer systems on an aircraft include
real-time systems based on dedicated operating systems and standard Linux/Windows-based
operating systems. In addition, there are networks of varying degrees of importance that are
logically separated. There is a need to consider and examine the adoption of existing solutions
for these systems and networks, such as monitoring products, firewalls, and antivirus products.
(3) Future Research Directions To expand the taxonomy and make it more accessible and usable,
we propose further research in the following areas.
• Cyber Attacks on Autonomous Systems Some aircraft systems are autonomous systems that
are designed to respond when needed, without the explicit involvement of the pilot. An example
of this is the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system (MCAS) [32], which was designed
to stabilize the aircraft without any intervention by the pilot. The MCAS is known to be involved
in several air accidents that took place in recent years [10]. These systems have the potential to
cause signficant damage to an aircraft and its passengers, as the crew’s degree of impact on these
systems is limited. Research is needed to examine how cyber attacks can affect these systems.
• Human Factor Addressing the human factor by training and preparing the aircrew to handle
and manage various events is important in the implementation of defense mechanisms and
methods in emergencies. When mapping the various risks and threats, it is necessary to examine
how new and existing security solutions can be adapted based on the skills and knowledge of
the aircrew. Some work dealing with human responses in emergencies has been done; a study
conducted by Ivan et al. [56] examined pilots’ responses to various cyber attacks. Future research
must address the need to generate and provide valuable and critical information to the pilot and
crew, e.g., data from intrusion detection systems. This can be done by developing new systems,
adapting relevant systems, and making the information from such systems clear to enable the

111:34

Habler, et al.

crew to handle exceptional events. An example of dealing with the clarity of information and its
accessibility to the pilot was presented by Habler et al. [21] who provided a deep learning based
solution for the detection of anomalous traffic conditions. The novelty was due to the fact that
the study dealt with the need to provide a clear indication to the pilot by using an explainability
technique designed to formulate and conveniently present computational model decisions.
• Threat Intelligence Platform In order to share knowledge, provide up-to-date examples of
threats, collect relevant data, and enrich the taxonomy, there is a need for a uniform threat
intelligence platform (TIP) which is accessible to airlines, airports, and manufacturers. Such a
platform will collect, aggregate, and organize threat intelligence data of various formats from
multiple sources. The TIP will allow security and threat intelligence teams to easily share threat
intelligence data with other stakeholders and security systems.

11 Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper, we provided a comprehensive overview of aircraft systems and components and
their various networks, emphasizing the cyber threats they are exposed to and the impact of a
cyber attack on an aircraft’s essential capabilities. We also presented a comprehensive and in-depth
taxonomy that standardizes the knowledge on and understanding of known threats to avionics
systems identified by industry and academia.

The proposed taxonomy deals with the various stages of cyber attacks. It covers avionics systems’
critical infrastructure, including air-ground communication, radio navigation aids, aeronautical
surveillance, and system-wide information management. Additionally, we addressed the different
domains of e-enabled aircraft and provided an analysis of the domains’ deployment, emphasizing
the points at which various networks overlap.

Based on our review and the issues raised in this paper, we conclude that a taxonomy dedicated
to avionics is needed given the diverse and intricate connections, systems, components, and attack
surfaces in avionics systems. There will be many challenges in developing and implementing
the required defense systems. More importantly, though, our research points to the need for
comprehensive defensive measures aimed at protecting passengers and crew members and ensuring
the safety of the aviation sector. once developed, these mechanisms can be added to the taxonomy,
enriching it as they improve safety.

To accomplish this, results published by security researchers must be verified, more studies
dealing with avionics defense systems and mechanisms need to be performed, and a unified threat
intelligence platform must be adopted for the benefit of all stakeholders.
