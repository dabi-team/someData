I.   INTRODUCTION  

In  the  field  of  safety,  security  and  IoT-aided  robotic 
applications  the  number  of  devices  involved  in  Machine-to-
Machine (M2M) communication is expected to steadily grow 
in next few years. Research and applications trends are leading 
to  the  appearance  of  the  IoT-aided  robotic  applications  [1]. 
Tele-operation 
requires  wireless 
communication,  what 
involves  multi-robot 
network and complex transmission of heterogeneous data.

During  our  recent  visit,  2014  IEEE-RAS  summer  school

that IoT-aided robotics applications are growing in the cyber-

     The  following  sections  of  this  paper  are  organized  as

aided robotic applications. In section 3,  the authors discussed 
network  interfacing  for  robotic  applications.  In  section  4, 
feasibility  of  proposed  architectures  in  current  IoT-aided 
robotic  applications  is  introduced.  In  section  5,  wraps  up  the 
discussion. Finally, section 6, gives the conclusion.  

II.  ENVISAGED IOT-AIDED ROBOTIC APPLICATIONS 

In modern world, IoT-aided robotic applications have been 
successfully applied in several domains, specifically in rescue 
robots, assisting robots, health care robots, in industrial plans 
and in the so called smart areas. Nevertheless, few  works are 
carried out on the interaction between these two fields, likely, 
robotic applications and IoT-aided domain. However it needs 
more in depth investigation. 

Most  of  the  modern  robots  platforms  are  equipped  with 
rich sensory sets, complex hardware with advanced computing 
and  communications  capabilities.  This,  make  them  able  to 
execute complex and coordinated operations. Technology that 
makes  robots  human-friendly  and  adaptable  to  different 
scenario is emerging in several robotic applications [5, 6, 7].  

The  networked  and  user interfaced  robots,  such  as rescue 
robots,  human  assisting  robots,  health  care  robots  and  robots 
for  military  applications,  have  been  identified  by  the  U.S.A.  
National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)  (in 
collaboration with Department of  Homeland Security - DHS) 
as  a  class  of  devices  in  which  the  hardware,  software, 
including  security  functions  must  be  developed  concurrently 
[8]. Demonstration, test, and evaluation are crucial in this area 
because of application of many emerging technologies, Fig. 2-

III.  NETWORK INTERFACING FOR ROBOTIC APPLICATION 
A  fundamental  issues  that  researchers  focus  in  the 
networks and interfaces domain in robotic applications, is the 
system 
the  components  use  different 
Machine-to-Machine  (M2M)  communication  standards.  To 
this direction are going several EU FP7 research projects [12], 
such  as  BETAAS  and  OPENIOT  [13,  14]  are  focusing:  on 
cloud  computing  techniques,  on  security  issues,  on  context 
aware  approaches,  and  on  semantic-oriented  design  (another 
examples  are  RELYONIT  [15],  ICORE  [16],  IOT.EST  [17], 
EBBITS [18], and VITRO [19]). 

On  the  other  hand,  with  reference  to  IoT-aided  robotic 
applications  several  important,  not  yet  answered  questions 
should be dealt with [20]: 

a) to  what  extent  IPv6  (Internet  Protocol  version  6-
recent),  and  Transport  Layer  Security  (TLS)  standard  can  be 
used to deal with complex robotic systems. 

b) can the  semantic  of  data  excahnge  over  the network 
be  directly  embedded  at  the  Media  Access  Control  (MAC) 
layer, with aims of enforcing security, privacy, and integrity. 

c) robotic 

communication 

extremly 
heterogeneous, thus deserving further research on  congestion 
avoidance, reliable routing mechanisms [21], and on efficient 
real- time handling of the big data amount.  

systems 

are 

The secure networking, allows robots to access a huge amount 
of  data,  Transport  Layer  Security  (TLS)  is  the  cryptographic 
protocol  suggested  by  the  NIST  for  secure  communication. 
TLS  is  put  on  the  top  of  traditional  protocols  like  e.g.,  TCP 
[22,  23].  About  2010,  the  term  cloud  robotics  has  been 
introduced  [24],  it  is  novel  paradigm  in  robotic  applications, 
where robots can take the advantages of the Internet network 
as  resource  for  massive  parallel  computation  and  for  almost 
real time knowledge sharing [25, 26].

In the structure of the mobile robot-Internet interface shown in 
Fig.  3,  the  robot  subscribes  the  information  from  the  cloud, 
and  its  sensors  -  including  vision;  deliver  the  information  to 
the cloud (they are publishers). 

In the figure the symbols mean the following: 

N – Network controller / monitor, 

 - cloud data buffers / data packages, 

 - network controller interfaces for publishers, 

 - network controller interfaces for subscriber, 

                    - lower layer network interfaces, 

  -  lower  layer  input  buffers  of  the  publishers 

(sensors, vision), 

  -  lower  layer  output  buffer  of  the  subscriber  (of  the 

robot, 

  -  higher  layer  output  buffers  of  the  publishers 

with Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms, 

  –  higher  layer  input  buffer  of  the  subscriber  with 

Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms. 

The publisher / subscriber module sends the acknowledgement 
of  status  information,  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirement, 
and  QoS  feedback  to  the  network  monitor  establishing 
communication  between  Machine-to-Machine  (M2M)  and 
Machine-to-Cloud (M2C) respectively.

client (Internet) and  server (Robot) – a,  communication  medium  between  server 
(Internet) and client (Robot) – b [46]. 

The  internet  is  the  data  storage.  In  this  case,  the  robots  are 
clients  requesting  the  data,  and  the  internets  are  server 
providing it data. The data can be different types: (1) motion  

data, (2) maps, (3) image buffer and so on (Fig. 4-b). On other 
side,  when  the internet is  the  client  and robot  is  the  server is 
used  when  controlling  multi  robots,  because  all  the  decision 
and motion strategies are provided in internet cloud (Fig. 4-a). 

Taking  into  account  of  above,  the  authors  presented  the 
features of most current diffused robots (see Table. 1),  trying 
to  address  this  question  with  reference  to  the  different 
scenarios.  Nowadays  there  are  several robots  available  in  the 
markets  designed  for  a  wide  spectrum  of  IoT-aided  robotic 
applications [27, 6]. According to [29], specialized robots are 
classified  to  two  categories:  service  robots  and  field  robots, 
executing supportive task for humans (e.g., domestic, personal 
mobility assistance, and rescue). The International Federation 
of Robotics (IFR) [43] expects that nearest future will bring, a 
rapid development of field robots, what - due to high level of 
such  robots  complexity  and  autonomy  will  stimulate  the 
development of new communication techniques.
