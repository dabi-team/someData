VERIFICATION OF INITIAL-STATE OPACITY FOR SWITCHED SYSTEMS: A
COMPOSITIONAL APPROACH

SIYUAN LIU1, ABDALLA SWIKIR2, AND MAJID ZAMANI3,4

Abstract. The security in information-ﬂow has become a major concern for cyber-physical systems (CPSs).
In this work, we focus on the analysis of an information-ﬂow security property, called opacity. Opacity
characterizes the plausible deniability of a system’s secret in the presence of a malicious outside intruder. We
propose a methodology of checking a notion of opacity, called approximate initial-state opacity, for networks
of discrete-time switched systems. Our framework relies on compositional constructions of ﬁnite abstractions
for networks of switched systems and their so-called approximate initial-state opacity-preserving simulation
functions (InitSOPSFs). Those functions characterize how close concrete networks and their ﬁnite abstractions
are in terms of the satisfaction of approximate initial-state opacity. We show that such InitSOPSFs can
be obtained compositionally by assuming some small-gain type conditions and composing so-called local
InitSOPSFs constructed for each subsystem separately. Additionally, assuming certain stability property of
switched systems, we also provide a technique on constructing their ﬁnite abstractions together with the
corresponding local InitSOPSFs. Finally, we illustrate the eﬀectiveness of our results through an example.

1. Introduction

Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are complex systems resulting from intricate interaction between embedded
cyber devices and physical plants. In recent decade, CPSs have become ubiquitous in critical infrastructures
and industrial control systems, including power plants, medical devices and smart communities [1]. While
the increased interaction between cyber and physical components increases systems’ functionalities, it also
exposes CPSs to more vulnerabilities and security challenges. Recently, the world has witnessed numerous
cyber-attacks which have led to great losses in people’s livelihoods [2]. Therefore, ensuring the security of
CPSs has become signiﬁcantly more important.

In this work, we focus on an information-ﬂow security property, called opacity, which characterizes the ability
that a system forbids leaking its secret information to a malicious intruder outside the system. Opacity was
ﬁrst introduced in [3] to analyze cryptographic protocols. Later, opacity was widely studied in the domain
of Discrete Event Systems (DESs), see [4] and the references therein. In this context, existing works on the
analysis of various notions of opacity mostly apply to systems modeled by ﬁnite state automata, which are
more suitable for the cyber-layers of CPSs. However, for the physical components, system dynamics are in
general hybrid with uncountable number of states.

1.1. Related Works. There have been some recent attempts to extend the notion of opacity to continuous-
space dynamical systems [5, 6, 7, 8]. In [5], a framework for opacity was introduced for the class of discrete-
time linear systems, where the notion of opacity was formulated as an output reachability property rather
than an information-ﬂow one. The results in [6] presented a formulation of opacity-preserving (bi)simulation
relations between transition systems, which allows one to verify opacity of an inﬁnite-state transition system
by leveraging its associated ﬁnite quotient one. However, the notion of opacity proposed in this work assumes
that the outputs of systems are symbols and are exactly distinguishable from each other, thus, is only suitable
for systems with purely logical output sets. In a more recent paper [7], a new notion of approximate opacity was
proposed to accommodate imperfect measurement precision of intruders. Based on this, the authors proposed
a notion of so-called approximate opacity-preserving simulation relation to capture the closeness between
continuous-space systems and their ﬁnite abstractions (a.k.a symbolic models) in terms of preservation of

approximate opacity. The recent results in [8] investigated opacity for discrete-time stochastic control systems
using a notion of so-called initial-state opacity-preserving stochastic simulation functions between stochastic
control systems and their ﬁnite abstractions (a.k.a. ﬁnite Markov decision processes).

Although the results in [6, 7, 8] look promising, the computational complexity of the construction of ﬁnite
abstractions in those works grows exponentially with respect to the dimension of the state set, and, hence,
those existing approaches will become computationally intractable when dealing with large-scale systems.

Motivated by those abstraction-based techniques in [6, 7, 8] and their limitations, this work proposes an
approach to analyze approximate initial-state opacity for networks of switched systems by constructing their
opacity-preserving ﬁnite abstractions compositionally. There have been some recent results proposing composi-
tional techniques for constructing ﬁnite abstractions for networks of systems (see the results in [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
for more details). However, the aforementioned compositional schemes are proposed for the sake of controller
synthesis for temporal logic properties, and none of them are applicable to deal with security properties
including opacity.

1.2. Contributions. In this paper, we provide for the ﬁrst time a compositional approach to analyze ap-
proximate initial-state opacity of a network of switched systems using their ﬁnite abstractions. A new notion
of so-called approximate initial-state opacity-preserving simulation function (InitSOPSF) is introduced as a
system relation to characterize the closeness between two networks in terms of preservation of approximate
initial-state opacity. We show that such an InitSOPSF can be established by composing certain local Init-
SOPSFs which relate each switched subsystem to its local ﬁnite abstraction. Moreover, under some assump-
tions ensuring incremental input-to-state stability of discrete-time switched systems, an approach is provided
to construct local ﬁnite abstractions along with the corresponding local InitSOPSFs for all of the subsystems.
Then, we derive some small-gain type conditions, under which one can construct a ﬁnite abstraction of the
concrete network of switched systems by interconnecting local ﬁnite abstractions of subsystems. Finally, one
can leverage the constructed ﬁnite abstraction of the network to check its opacity. The proposed compositional
abstraction-based opacity veriﬁcation pipeline is depicted in Figure 1.

notations and preliminaries of the paper. Then, a new notion of approximate opacity preserving simulation
functions (InitSOPSFs) is proposed in Section 3.

how to construct local ﬁnite abstractions for a class of incrementally input-to-state stable subsystems, and
then propose a small-gain type condition required for the main compositionality result. Next, an illustrative
example is provided in Section 6 that showcases how one can leverage our compositionality results for the
veriﬁcation of opacity for a network of switched systems. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 7.

2. Notation and Preliminaries

2.1. Notation. We denote by R and N the set of real numbers and non-negative integers, respectively. These
symbols are annotated with subscripts to restrict them in the obvious way, e.g. R>0 denotes the positive
real numbers. We denote the closed, open, and half-open intervals in R by [a, b], (a, b), [a, b), and (a, b],
respectively. For a, b ∈ N and a ≤ b, we use [a; b], (a; b), [a; b), and (a; b] to denote the corresponding
intervals in N. Given any a ∈ R, |a| denotes the absolute value of a. Given N ∈ N≥1 vectors νi ∈ Rni,
ni ∈ N≥1, and i ∈ [1; N ], we use ν = [ν1; . . . ; νN ] to denote the vector in Rn with n = (cid:80)
i ni consisting
of the concatenation of vectors νi. Moreover, (cid:107)ν(cid:107) denotes the inﬁnity norm of ν. The individual elements
in a matrix A ∈ Rm×n, are denoted by {A}i,j, where i ∈ [1; m] and j ∈ [1; n]. We denote by card(·)
the cardinality of a given set and by ∅ the empty set. For any set S ⊆ Rn of the form of ﬁnite union
of boxes, e.g., S = (cid:83)M
i=1[cj
i , we deﬁne
span(S) = minj=1,...,M ηSj and ηSj = min{|dj
1|, . . . , |dj
n|}. Moreover, for a set in the form of
X = (cid:81)N
i=1 Xi, where Xi ⊆ Rni , ∀i ∈ [1; N ], are of the form of ﬁnite union of boxes, and any positive
(component-wise) vector φ = [φ1; . . . ; φN ] with φi ≤ span(Xi), ∀i ∈ [1; N ], we deﬁne [X]φ = (cid:81)N
i=1[Xi]φi,
where [Xi]φi = [Rni]φi ∩ Xi and [Rni]φi = {a ∈ Rni
| aj = kjφi, kj ∈ Z, j = 1, . . . , ni}. Note that if
φ = [η; . . . ; η], where 0 < η ≤ span(S), we simply use notation [S]η rather than [S]φ. With a slight abuse of
notation, we write [S]0 := S. Note that [S]η (cid:54)= ∅ for any 0 ≤ η ≤ span(S). We use notations K and K∞ to
denote diﬀerent classes of comparison functions, as follows: K = {α : R≥0 → R≥0| α is continuous, strictly
increasing, and α(0) = 0}; K∞ = {α ∈ K|
α(r) = ∞}. For α, γ ∈ K∞ we write α ≤ γ if α(r) ≤ γ(r), and,
with abuse of the notation, α = c if α(r) = cr for all c, r ≥ 0. Finally, we denote by Id the identity function
over R≥0, that is Id(r) = r, ∀r ∈ R≥0. Given sets X and Y with X ⊂ Y , the complement of X with respect
to Y is deﬁned as Y \X = {x : x ∈ Y, x /∈ X}.

2.2. Discrete-Time Switched Systems. We consider discrete-time switched systems of the following form.

Deﬁnition 1. A discrete-time switched system (dt-SS) Σ is deﬁned by the tuple Σ = (X, X0, Xs, P, W, F, Y, h),
where

• X ⊆ Rn is the state set;
• X0 ⊆ Rn is the initial state set;
• Xs ⊆ Rn is the secret state set;
• P = {1, . . . , m} is the ﬁnite set of modes;
• W ⊆ Rm is the internal input set;
• F = {f1, . . . , fm} is a collection of set-valued maps fp : X × W ⇒ X for all p ∈ P ;
• Y ⊆ Rq is the output set;
• h : X → Y is the output map.

The dt-SS Σ is described by diﬀerence inclusions of the form

Σ :

(cid:26) x(k + 1) ∈ fp(k)(x(k), ω(k)),
y(k) = h(x(k)),

(1)

4

SIYUAN LIU1, ABDALLA SWIKIR2, AND MAJID ZAMANI3,4

where x : N → X, y : N → Y, p : N → P , and ω : N → W are the state, output, switching, and internal input
signal, respectively.

Let ϕk, k ∈ N≥1, denote the time when the k-th switching instant occurs. We assume that signal p satisﬁes
a dwell-time condition [14] (i.e. there exists kd ∈ N≥1, called the dwell-time, such that for all consecutive
switching time instants ϕk, ϕk+1, ϕk+1 − ϕk ≥ kd). If for all x ∈ X, p ∈ P, w ∈ W, card(fp(x, w)) ≤ 1, we say
the system Σ is deterministic, and non-deterministic otherwise. System Σ is called ﬁnite if X, W are ﬁnite sets
and inﬁnite otherwise. Furthermore, if for all x ∈ X there exist p ∈ P and w ∈ W such that card(fp(x, w)) (cid:54)= 0
we say the system is non-blocking. In this paper, we only deal with non-blocking systems.

2.3. Transition systems. In this subsection, we employ the notion of transition systems, introduced in [15],
to provide an alternative description of switched systems that can be later directly related to their ﬁnite
abstractions in a common framework.
Deﬁnition 2. Given a dt-SS Σ = (X, X0, Xs, P, W, F, Y, h), we deﬁne the associated transition system T (Σ) =
(X, X0, Xs, U, W, F, Y, H), where:

• X = X × P × {0, . . . , kd − 1} is the state set;
• X0 = X0 × P × {0} is the initial state set;
• Xs = Xs × P × {0, . . . , kd − 1} is the secret state set;
• U = P is the external input set;
• W = W is the internal input set;
• F is the transition function given by (x+, p+, l+) ∈ F((x, p, l), u, w) if and only if x+ ∈ fp(x, w), u = p

and the following scenarios hold:

– l < kd − 1, p+ = p and l+ = l + 1: switching is not allowed because the time elapsed since the

latest switch is strictly smaller than the dwell time;

– l = kd − 1, p+ = p and l+ = kd − 1: switching is allowed but no switch occurs;
– l = kd − 1, p+ (cid:54)= p and l+ = 0: switching is allowed and a switch occurs;

• Y = Y is the output set;
• H : X → Y is the output map deﬁned as H(x, p, l) = h(x).

Note that in the above deﬁnition, two additional variables p and l are added to the state tuple of the system
Σ. The variable p captures whether or not a switching is allowed for the system at a given time instant, and
l serves as a memory to record the sojourn of switching signal.

The following proposition is borrowed from [13] showing that the output runs of a dt-SS Σ and its associated
transition system T (Σ) are equivalent so that one can use Σ and T (Σ) interchangeably.

Proposition 3. Consider a transition system T (Σ) in Deﬁnition 2 associated to Σ as in Deﬁnition 1. Any
output trajectory of Σ can be uniquely equated to an output trajectory of T (Σ) and vice versa.

Next, let us introduce a formal deﬁnition of networks of dt-SS (or equivalently, networks of transition systems).

2.4. Networks of Systems. Consider N ∈ N≥1 dt-SS Σi = (Xi, X0i, Xsi, Pi, Wi, Fi, Yi, hi), i ∈ [1; N ], with
partitioned internal inputs and outputs as

wi = [wi1; . . . ; wi(i−1); wi(i+1); . . . ; wiN ], Wi =

particular, we assume that wij = yji, if there is connection from system Σj to Σi, otherwise, we set hji ≡ 0.
In the sequel, we denote by Ni = {j ∈ [1; N ], j (cid:54)= i|hji (cid:54)= 0} the collection of neighboring systems Σj, j ∈ Ni,
that provide internal inputs to system Σi.
Now, we are ready to provide a formal deﬁnition of the concrete network consisting of N ∈ N≥1 dt-SS.
Deﬁnition 4. Consider N ∈ N≥1 dt-SS Σi = (Xi, X0i, Xsi, Pi, Wi, Fi, Yi, hi), i ∈ [1; N ] with the input-output
structure given by (2) and (3). The network, representing the interconnection of N ∈ N≥1 dt-SS Σi, is a tuple
Σ = (X, X0, Xs, P, F, Y, h), denoted by I(Σ1, . . . , ΣN ), where X = (cid:81)N

Similarly, given transition systems T (Σi), one can also deﬁne a network of transition systems I(T (Σ1),. . ., T (ΣN )).
For the rest of the paper, we mainly deal with the transition systems as they allow us to model dt-SS Σ and
their ﬁnite abstractions in a common framework.
For an interconnection of N ∈ N≥1 ﬁnite dt-SS ˆΣi, with input-output structure conﬁguration as in (2) and
(3), we introduce the following deﬁnition of networks of ﬁnite dt-SS.
Deﬁnition 5. Consider N ∈ N≥1 ﬁnite dt-SS ˆΣi = ( ˆXi, ˆX0i, ˆXsi, ˆPi, ˆWi, ˆFi, ˆYi, ˆhi), i ∈ [1; N ] with the input-
output structure given by (2) and (3). The network, representing the interconnection of N ∈ N≥1 ﬁnite dt-SS
ˆΣi, is a tuple ˆΣ = ( ˆX, ˆX0, ˆXs, ˆP , ˆF , ˆY, ˆh), denoted by ˆI( ˆΣ1, . . . , ˆΣN ), where ˆX = (cid:81)N
ˆX0i, ˆXs =

ˆXsi, ˆP = (cid:81)N
subject to the constraint:

(cid:107)ˆyji − ˆwij(cid:107) ≤ φij, [ ˆYji]φij ⊆ ˆWij, ∀i ∈ [1; N ], j ∈ Ni,
where φij is an internal input quantization parameter designed for constructing local ﬁnite abstractions (cf.
Deﬁnition 17).

(5)

Similarly, given ﬁnite transition systems T ( ˆΣi), one can also deﬁne a network of transition systems as
ˆI(T ( ˆΣ1), . . . , T ( ˆΣN )).

An example of a concrete network and an abstract network is illustrated in Figure 2, where each consists of
three switched subsystems.

Remark 6. Note that in the above deﬁnitions, the interconnection constraint in (4) for the concrete network
is diﬀerent from that for the abstract network in (5). For networks of ﬁnite abstractions, due to possibly
diﬀerent granularities of ﬁnite internal input sets ˆWij and output sets ˆYij, we introduce parameters φij in
(5) for having a well-posed interconnection. The values of φij will be designed later in Deﬁnition 17 when
constructiong local ﬁnite abstractions of the subsystems.

Before introducing the notion of approximate initial-state opacity for networks of transition systems, we
introduce some notations that will be used to characterize opacity property. Consider network T (Σ). We use
zk to denote the state of T (Σ) reached at time k ∈ N from initial state z0 under an input sequence ¯u with
length k, and denote by {z0, z1, . . . , zn} a ﬁnite state run of T (Σ) with length n ∈ N.

2.5. Approximate Initial-state Opacity. Here, let us review a notion of approximate initial-state opacity
[7]. In this context, the system’s behaviors are assumed to be observed by an outside intruder which aims at
inferring secret information of the system. The adopted concept of secrets are formulated as state-based.

Deﬁnition 7. Consider network T (Σ) = (X, X0, Xs, U, F, Y, H) and a constant δ ≥ 0. Network T (Σ) is said
to be δ-approximate initial-state opaque if for any z0 ∈ X0 ∩ Xs and ﬁnite state run {z0, z1, . . . , zn}, there

Figure 2. [Left]: Concrete network composed of three switched subsystems Σ1, Σ2, and Σ3

three ﬁnite subsystems ˆΣ1, ˆΣ2, and ˆΣ3 with ˆh13 = ˆh31 = 0, and the internal inputs ˆwij for
system ˆΣi are taken from the discretized internal outputs of system ˆΣj under the constraint

exist ¯z0 ∈ X0 \ Xs and a ﬁnite state run {¯z0, ¯z1, . . . , ¯zn} such that

max
k∈[0;n]

(cid:107)H(zk) − H(¯zk)(cid:107) ≤ δ.

Intuitively, the notion of δ-approximate initial-state opacity requires that, whenever observing any output run,
an intruder with measurement precision δ is never certain that the system is initiated from a secret state. In
other words, the systems’ secret information can never be revealed in the presence of an intruder that does
not have an enough measurement precision.

Remark 8. The approximate initial-state opacity is, in general, hard to check for a concrete network since
there is no systematic way in the literature to check opacity for systems with inﬁnite state set so far. On the
other hand, existing tool DESUMA1 and algorithms [16], [17],[6, Sec. IV] in DESs literature can be leveraged to
check exact opacity for networks with ﬁnite state sets. Therefore, it would be more feasible to verify opacity for
networks consisting of ﬁnite abstractions and then carry back the veriﬁcation result to concrete ones, given a
formal simulation relation between those networks. To this purpose, an opacity-preserving simulation relation
will be introduced in the next section which formally relate a network of transition systems and its ﬁnite
abstraction.

3. Opacity Preserving Simulation Functions

In this section, we introduce a notion of approximate initial-state opacity-preserving simulation function to
quantitatively relate two networks of transition systems in terms of preserving approximate initial-state opacity.
Such a function can be constructed compositionally as shown in Section 4.

Let us ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of approximate initial-state opacity-preserving simulation relations which was
originally proposed in [7].

Deﬁnition 9. Consider networks T (Σ) = (X, X0, Xs, U, F, Y, H) and T ( ˆΣ) = ( ˆX, ˆX0, ˆXs, ˆU , ˆF, ˆY , ˆH) where
ˆY ⊆ Y . For ˆε ∈ R≥0, a relation R ⊆ X × ˆX is called an ˆε-approximate initial-state opacity-preserving
simulation relation (ˆε-InitSOP simulation relation) from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ) if

1 (a) ∀z0 ∈ X0 ∩ Xs, ∃ˆz0 ∈ ˆX0 ∩ ˆXs, s.t. (z0, ˆz0) ∈ R;
(b) ∀ˆz0 ∈ ˆX0 \ ˆXs, ∃z0 ∈ X0 \ Xs, s.t. (z0, ˆz0) ∈ R;

2 ∀(z, ˆz) ∈ R, (cid:107)H(z) − ˆH(ˆz)(cid:107) ≤ ˆε;
3 For any (z, ˆz) ∈ R, one has:

(a) ∀u ∈ U , ∀z+ ∈ F(z, u), ∃ˆu ∈ ˆU , ∃ˆz+ ∈ ˆF(ˆz, ˆu), s.t. (z+, ˆz+) ∈ R;
(b) ∀ˆu ∈ ˆU , ∀ˆz+ ∈ ˆF(ˆz, ˆu), ∃u ∈ U , ∃z+ ∈ F(z, u), s.t. (z+, ˆz+) ∈ R.

The following corollary borrowed from [7] shows the usefulness of Deﬁnition 9 in terms of preserving approxi-
mate opacity across related networks.

Corollary 10. Consider networks T (Σ) = (X, X0, Xs, U, F, Y, H) and T ( ˆΣ) = ( ˆX, ˆX0, ˆXs, ˆU , ˆF, ˆY , ˆH) where
ˆY ⊆ Y . Let ˆε, δ ∈ R≥0. If there exists an ˆε-InitSOP simulation relation from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ) as in Deﬁnition
9 and ˆε ≤ δ

2 , then the following implication holds

T ( ˆΣ) is (δ − 2ˆε)-approximate initial-state opaque
⇒ T (Σ) is δ-approximate initial-state opaque.

The above implication across related networks provides us a suﬃcient condition for verifying approximate
initial-state opacity of a complex network using abstraction-based techniques. Particularly, when confronted
with a large network of switched systems, one can construct a ﬁnite abstraction T ( ˆΣ) of the concrete network
T (Σ), conduct the opacity veriﬁcation over the simpler network T ( ˆΣ) and carry back the results to the concrete
one. However, the above-mentioned InitSOP simulation relation is in general diﬃcult to establish, especially
when one is interested to build such a relation in a compositional framework. Therefore, in the following, we
introduce a new notion of approximate initial-state opacity-preserving simulation function that relates two
networks in terms of preserving approximate initial-state opacity.

Deﬁnition 11. Consider networks T (Σ) = (X, X0, Xs, U, F, Y, H) and T ( ˆΣ) = ( ˆX, ˆX0, ˆXs, ˆU , ˆF, ˆY , ˆH) with
ˆY ⊆ Y . For ε ∈ R≥0, a function S : X × ˆX → R≥0 is called an ε-approximate initial-state opacity-preserving
simulation function (ε-InitSOPSF) from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ) if there exists a function α ∈ K∞ such that

1 (a) ∀z0 ∈ X0 ∩ Xs, ∃ˆz0 ∈ ˆX0 ∩ ˆXs, s.t. S(z0, ˆz0) ≤ ε;
(b) ∀ˆz0 ∈ ˆX0 \ ˆXs, ∃z0 ∈ X0 \ Xs, s.t. S(z0, ˆz0) ≤ ε;

2 ∀z ∈ X, ∀ˆz ∈ ˆX, α((cid:107)H(z) − ˆH(ˆz)(cid:107)) ≤ S(z, ˆz);
3 ∀z ∈ X, ∀ˆz ∈ ˆX s.t. S(z, ˆz) ≤ ε, one has:

(a) ∀u ∈ U , ∀z+ ∈ F(z, u), ∃ˆu ∈ ˆU , ∃ˆz+ ∈ ˆF(ˆz, ˆu), s.t. S(z+, ˆz+) ≤ ε;
(b) ∀ˆu ∈ ˆU , ∀ˆz+ ∈ ˆF(ˆz, ˆu), ∃u ∈ U , ∃z+ ∈ F(z, u), s.t. S(z+, ˆz+) ≤ ε.

We say that T ( ˆΣ) is an abstraction of T (Σ) if there exists an ε-InitSOPSF from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ). In addition,
if T ( ˆΣ) is ﬁnite ( ˆX is a ﬁnite set), system T ( ˆΣ) is called a ﬁnite abstraction (symbolic model) of the network
T (Σ), and is denoted by T (Σ) (cid:22)ε T ( ˆΣ).

Although Deﬁnition 11 is general in the sense that networks T (Σ) and T ( ˆΣ) can be either inﬁnite or ﬁnite,
network T ( ˆΣ) practically consists of N ∈ N≥1 ﬁnite abstractions. Hence, checking approximate initial-state
opacity for this network is decidable in comparison to network T (Σ).

The next result shows that the existence of an ε-InitSOPSF as we proposed in Deﬁnition 11 for networks of
transition systems implies the existence of an ˆε-InitSOP simulation relation as in Deﬁnition 9.

Proposition 12. Consider networks T (Σ) = (X, X0, Xs, U, F, Y, H) and T ( ˆΣ) = ( ˆX, ˆX0, ˆXs, ˆU , ˆF, ˆY , ˆH)
where ˆY ⊆ Y . Assume S is an ε-InitSOPSF from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ) as in Deﬁnition 11. Then, relation R ⊆ X × ˆX
deﬁned by

(cid:110)

R =

(z, ˆz) ∈ X × ˆX|S(z, ˆz) ≤ ε

(cid:111)

is an ˆε-InitSOP simulation relation from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ) with
ˆε = α−1(ε).

Proof. Condition 1 follows immediately from condition 1 in Deﬁnition 11, i.e. S(z0, ˆz0) ≤ ε. Next, we show
that ∀(z, ˆz) ∈ R: (cid:107)H(z) − ˆH(ˆz)(cid:107) ≤ ˆε. From the deﬁnition of R and condition 2 in Deﬁnition 11, it is readily
seen that (cid:107)H(z)− ˆH(ˆz)(cid:107) ≤ α−1(ε) = ˆε. Finally, we show condition 3 for R. Consider any pair of (z, ˆz) ∈ X × ˆX
in relation R and by the deﬁnition of R, one has S(z, ˆz) ≤ ε. Additionally, from 3(a) in Deﬁnition 11, one also
has ∀u ∈ U , ∀z+ ∈ F(z, u), ∃ˆu ∈ ˆU , ∃ˆz+ ∈ ˆF(ˆz, ˆu) s.t. S(z+, ˆz+) ≤ ε. Hence, it follows that (z+, ˆz+) ∈ R
which satisﬁes condition 3(a) of R. Condition 3(b) can be proved in the same way and is omitted here, which
(cid:3)
concludes the proof.

Given the results of Corollary 10 and Proposition 12, one can readily see that if there exists an ε-InitSOPSF
from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ) as in Deﬁnition 11 and T ( ˆΣ) is (δ − 2ˆε)-approximate initial-state opaque, then T (Σ) is
δ-approximate initial-state opaque, where ˆε = α−1(ε) ≤ δ

2 , and δ ∈ R≥0.

4. Compositional Construction of Approximate Initial-state Opacity Preserving Simulation

Function

As shown in the previous section, the proposed ε-InitSOPSF can be used for checking approximate initial-
state opacity of concrete networks by leveraging their ﬁnite abstractions. However, for a network consisting
of a large number of switched systems, constructing the corresponding ε-InitSOPSF and the abstract network
monolithically is not feasible in general due to curse of dimensionality. Hence, in this section, we introduce
a compositional framework based on which one can break down the intricate task in parts that are more
manageable to accomplish. In particular, we ﬁrst relate local ﬁnite abstractions of the subsystems via so-called
local InitSOPSFs. Then, one can obtain the abstract network by interconnecting the local ﬁnite abstractions
of the subsystems. Additionally, the corresponding ε-InitSOPSF to capture the closeness between the concrete
and the abstract networks can be established by composing the local InitSOPSFs as well.

Let us ﬁrst introduce a notion of local InitSOPSF for switched subsystems with internal inputs in the following
subsection.

4.1. Local Approximate Initial-state Opacity Preserving Simulation Function. Suppose that we are
given N dt-SS Σi = (Xi, X0i, Xsi, Pi, Wi, Fi, Yi, hi), i ∈ [1; N ], or equivalently, T (Σi) = (Xi, X0i, Xsi, Ui, Wi, Fi,
Yi, Hi). Moreover, we assume that each system T (Σi) and its abstraction T ( ˆΣi) admit a local εi-InitSOPSF
as deﬁned next.
Deﬁnition 13. Consider transition systems T (Σi) = (Xi, X0i, Xsi, Ui, Wi, Fi, Yi, Hi) and T ( ˆΣi) = ( ˆXi, ˆX0i, ˆXsi,
ˆUi, ˆWi, ˆFi, ˆYi, ˆHi), for all i ∈ [1; N ], where ˆWi ⊆ Wi and ˆYi ⊆ Yi. For εi ∈ R≥0, a function Si : Xi × ˆXi → R≥0
is called a local εi-InitSOPSF from T (Σi) to T ( ˆΣi) if there exist a constant ϑi ∈ R≥0, and a function αi ∈ K∞
such that

1 (a) ∀z0
(b) ∀ˆz0

i ∈ X0i ∩ Xsi, ∃ˆz0

(a) ∀ui ∈ Ui, ∀z+
(b) ∀ˆui ∈ ˆUi, ∀ˆz+

i ∈ Fi(zi, ui, wi), ∃ˆui ∈ ˆUi, ∃ˆz+
i ∈ ˆFi(ˆzi, ˆui, ˆwi), ∃ui ∈ Ui, ∃z+

i ∈ Fi(zi, ui, wi) s.t. Si(z+

i ) ≤ εi;
i ) ≤ εi.

We say that T ( ˆΣi) is an abstraction of T (Σi) if there exists a local εi-InitSOPSF from T (Σi) to T ( ˆΣi). In
addition, if T ( ˆΣi) is ﬁnite ( ˆXi and ˆWi are ﬁnite sets), system T ( ˆΣi) is called a ﬁnite abstraction (symbolic
model) of T (Σi), and is denoted by T (Σi) (cid:22)εi

L T ( ˆΣi)

Note that the local εi-InitSOPSFs are mainly proposed for constructing a ε-InitSOPSF for the networks and
they are not directly used for deducing approximate initial-state opacity-preserving simulation relation. Next,
we show how to compose the above deﬁned local εi-InitSOPSFs so that it can be used to quantify the distance
between two networks.

4.2. Compositional Construction of Initial-state Opacity Preserving Simulation Function. In this
subsection, we provide one of the main results of the paper. The following theorem provides a compositional
approach for the construction of an ε-InitSOPSF from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ) via local εi-InitSOPSFs from T (Σi) to
T ( ˆΣi).

Theorem 14. Consider network T (Σ) = I(T (Σ1), . . . , T (ΣN )). Assume that each T (Σi) admits an abstrac-
tion T ( ˆΣi) together with a local εi-InitSOPSF Si, associated with function αi and constant ϑi as in Deﬁnition
13. Let ε = max

εi. If ∀i ∈ [1; N ], ∀j ∈ Ni,

i

j (εj) + φij ≤ ϑi,
where φij is an internal input quantization parameter for constructing the local ﬁnite abstractions T ( ˆΣi), then,
function S : X × ˆX → R≥0 deﬁned as

is an ε-InitSOPSF from T (Σ) = I(T (Σ1), . . . , T (ΣN )) to T ( ˆΣ) = ˆI(T ( ˆΣ1), . . . , T ( ˆΣN )).

Proof. First, we show that condition 1(a) in Deﬁnition 11 holds. Consider any z0 ∈ X0 ∩ XS. For any
system T (Σi) and the corresponding εi-InitSOPSF Si, from the deﬁnition of Si, we have ∀z0
i ∈ X0i ∩ Xsi,
∃ˆz0
i ) ≤ εi. Then, from the deﬁnition of S in (9) we get S(z0, ˆz0) ≤ ε, where
ˆz0 ∈ ˆX0 ∩ ˆXS. Thus, condition 1(a) in Deﬁnition 11 holds. Condition 1(b) can be proved in the same way,
thus is omitted. Now, we show that condition 2 in Deﬁnition 11 holds for some K∞ function α. Consider any
z = [z1; . . . ; zN ] ∈ X and ˆz = [ˆz1; . . . ; ˆzN ] ∈ ˆX. Then, using condition 2 in Deﬁnition 13, one gets

which satisﬁes condition 2 in Deﬁnition 11. Now, we show that condition 3 holds. Let us consider any z ∈ X
and ˆz ∈ ˆX such that S(z, ˆz) ≤ ε. It can be seen that from the structure of S in (9), we get Si(zi, ˆzi) ≤ εi,
∀i ∈ [1; N ]. For each pair of systems T (Σi) and T ( ˆΣi), the internal inputs satisfy the chain of inequality

Using (8), one has (cid:107)wi − ˆwi(cid:107) ≤ ϑi. Therefore, by Deﬁnition 13 for each pair of systems T (Σi) and T ( ˆΣi), one
has ∀ui ∈ Ui, ∀z+

a result, we get ∀u = [u1; . . . ; uN ] ∈ U , ∀z+ ∈ F(z, u), there exists ˆu = [ˆu1; . . . ; ˆuN ] ∈ ˆU and ˆz+ ∈ ˆF(ˆz, ˆu)

conclude that S is a ε-InitSOPSF from T (Σ) = I(T (Σ1), . . . , T (ΣN )) to T ( ˆΣ) = ˆI(T ( ˆΣ1), . . . , T ( ˆΣN )).

Till here, we have seen that one can construct an abstraction of a network of switched systems by intercon-
necting local abstractions of the subsystems. The overall InitSOPSF between two networks is established by
composing local InitSOPSFs as well. This abstract network saﬁsties Deﬁnition 11, which allows us to check
approximate opacity property over the simpler abstract network and carry the results back to the concrete
network using the results provided in Corollary 10.

Next, we are going to impose certain conditions on the dynamics of the subsystems, such that one can construct
proper abstractions for all of the subsystems together with the corresponding local InitSOPSFs.

5. Construction of Finite Abstractions

In this section, we are going to explore how to construct ﬁnite abstractions together with local InitSOPSFs for
subsystems. The dt-SS Σ = (X, X0, Xs, P, W, F, Y, h) are assumed to be inﬁnite and deterministic. Moreover,
we assume the output map h satisﬁes the following general Lipschitz assumption: there exists an (cid:96) ∈ K∞
such that: (cid:107)h(x) − h(y)(cid:107) ≤ (cid:96)((cid:107)x − y(cid:107)) for all x, y ∈ X. Here, we also use Σp to denote a dt-SS Σ in (1) with
constant switching signal p(k) = p, ∀k ∈ N.

5.1. Construction of Local Finite Abstractions. Note that throughout this subsection, we are mainly
talking about switched subsystems rather than the overall network. However, for the sake of better readability,
we omit index i of subsystems throughout the text in this subsection, e.g., we write T (Σ) instead of T (Σi).

Here, we establish an ε-InitSOPSF between T (Σ) and its ﬁnite abstraction by assuming that, for all p ∈ P ,
Σp is incrementally input-to-state stable (δ-ISS) [18] as deﬁned next.
Deﬁnition 15. System Σp is δ-ISS if there exist functions Vp : X × X → R≥0, αp, αp, ρp ∈ K∞, and constant
0 < κp < 1, such that for all x, ˆx ∈ X, and for all w, ˆw ∈ W

αp((cid:107)x − ˆx(cid:107)) ≤ Vp(x, ˆx) ≤ αp((cid:107)x − ˆx(cid:107)),
Vp(fp(x, w),fp(ˆx, ˆw)) ≤ κpVp(x, ˆx) + ρp((cid:107)w − ˆw(cid:107)).

(10)

(11)

Remark 16. We say that Vp, ∀p ∈ P , are multiple δ-ISS Lyapunov functions for subsystem Σ if it satisﬁes
(10) and (11). Moreover, if Vp = Vp+, ∀p, p+ ∈ P , we omit the index p in (10), (11), and say that V is
a common δ-ISS Lyapunov function for system Σ. We refer interested readers to [14] for more details on
common and multiple Lyapunov functions for switched systems.

Now, we show how to construct a local ﬁnite abstraction T ( ˆΣ) of transition system T (Σ) associated to the
switched subsystem Σ in which Σp is δ-ISS.

Deﬁnition 17. Consider a transition system T (Σ) = (X, X0, Xs, U, W, F, Y, H), associated to the switched
subsystem Σ = (X, X0, Xs, P, W, F, Y, h), where X, W are assumed to be ﬁnite unions of boxes. Let Σp be δ-ISS
as in Deﬁnition 15. Then one can construct a ﬁnite abstraction T ( ˆΣ) = ( ˆX, ˆX0, ˆXs, ˆU , ˆW , ˆF, ˆY , ˆH) where:

• ˆX = ˆX × P × {0, . . . , kd − 1}, where ˆX = [X]η and 0 < η ≤ min{span(Xs), span(X \ Xs)} is the state

set quantization parameter;

• ˆX0 = ˆX0 × P × {0}, where ˆX0 = [X0]η;
• ˆXs = ˆXs × P × {0, · · · , kd − 1}, where ˆXs = [Xs]η;

• ˆU = U = P ;
• (ˆx+, p+, l+) ∈ ˆF((ˆx, p, l), ˆu, ˆw) if and only if (cid:107)fp(ˆx, ˆw) − ˆx+(cid:107) ≤ η, ˆu = p and the following scenarios

hold:

– l < kd − 1, p+ = p and l+ = l + 1;
– l = kd − 1, p+ = p and l+ = kd − 1;
– l = kd − 1, p+ (cid:54)= p and l+ = 0;

• ˆY = {H(ˆx, p, l)|(ˆx, p, l) ∈ ˆX};
• ˆH : ˆX → ˆY , deﬁned as ˆH(ˆx, p, l) = H(ˆx, p, l) = h(ˆx);
• ˆW = [W]φ, where φ, satisfying 0 < (cid:107)φ(cid:107) ≤ span(W), is the internal input set quantization parameter.

An illustration of the computation of the transitions of T ( ˆΣ) is shown in Figure 3.

Note that in the case when the concrete switched subsystem Σ admits a common δ-ISS Lyapunov function as
in Remark 16, Deﬁnition 17 boils down to the following.

Deﬁnition 18. Consider a transition system T (Σ) = (X, X0, Xs, U, W, F, Y, H), associated to the switched
subsystem Σ = (X, X0, Xs, P, W, F, Y, h), where X, W are assumed to be ﬁnite unions of boxes. Suppose Σ
admits a common δ-ISS Lyapunov function as in Remark 16. Then one can construct a ﬁnite abstraction
T ( ˆΣ) = ( ˆX, ˆX0, ˆXs, ˆU , ˆW , ˆF, ˆY , ˆH) where:

• ˆX = [X]η, where 0 < η ≤ min{span(Xs), span(X \ Xs)} is the state set quantization parameter;
• ˆX0 = [X0]η;
• ˆXs = [Xs]η;
• ˆU = P ;
• ˆx+ ∈ ˆF(ˆx, ˆu, ˆw) if and only if (cid:107)fˆu(ˆx, ˆw) − ˆx+(cid:107) ≤ η;
• ˆY = {h(ˆx)|ˆx ∈ ˆX};
• ˆH : ˆX → ˆY , deﬁned as ˆH(ˆx) = h(ˆx);
• ˆW = [W]φ, where φ, satisfying 0 < (cid:107)φ(cid:107) ≤ span(W), is the internal input set quantization parameter.

In order to construct a local ε-InitSOPSF from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ), we raise the following assumptions on functions
Vp appeared in Deﬁnition 15, which are used to prove some of the main results later.

Assumption 19. There exists µ ≥ 1 such that

∀x, y ∈ X, ∀p, q ∈ P, Vp(x, y) ≤ µVq(x, y).

(12)

Assumption 19 is an incremental version of a similar assumption in [19] that is used to prove input-to-state
stability of switched systems under constrained switching signals.

Assumption 20. For all p ∈ P , there exists a K∞ function γp such that

∀x, y, z ∈ X, Vp(x, y) ≤ Vp(x, z) + γp((cid:107)y − z(cid:107)).

(13)

Assumption 20 is non-restrictive as shown in [20] provided that one is interested to work on a compact subset
of X.
Now, we establish the relation between T (Σ) and T ( ˆΣ), introduced above, via the notion of local ε-InitSOPSF
as in Deﬁnition 13.

Theorem 21. Consider a dt-SS Σ = (X, X0, Xs, P, W, F, Y, h) with its equivalent transition system T (Σ) =
(X, X0, XS, U, W, F, Y, H). Suppose Σp is δ-ISS as in Deﬁnition 15, with a function Vp equipped with functions
αp, αp, ρp and constant κp, and Assumptions 19 and 20 hold. Let (cid:15) > 1. For any design parameters ε, ϑ ∈ R≥0,
let T ( ˆΣ) be a ﬁnite abstraction of T (Σ) constructed as in Deﬁnition 17 with any quantization parameter η
satisfying

Proof. We start by proving condition 1 in Deﬁnition 13. Consider any initial and secret state (x0, p0, 0) ∈
X0 ∩ Xs in T (Σ). From Deﬁnition 17, for every (x0, p0, 0) ∈ X0 ∩ Xs, there always exists (ˆx0, p0, 0) ∈ ˆX0 ∩ ˆXs
such that (cid:107)x0 − ˆx0(cid:107) ≤ η. Hence, using (10), there exists (ˆx0, p0, 0) ∈ ˆX0 ∩ ˆXs with V((x0, p0, 0), (ˆx0, p0, 0)) ≤
αp((cid:107)x0−ˆx0(cid:107))
and α(η) ≤ ε by (14). For every

(ˆx0, p0, 0) ∈ ˆX0\ ˆXs, by choosing x0 = ˆx0 with (x0, p0, 0) also being inside X0\Xs, we get V((x0, p0, 0), (ˆx0, p0, 0)) =
0 ≤ ε. Hence, condition 1(b) in Deﬁnition 13 holds as well.

Next, we show condition 2 in Deﬁnition 13 holds. Given the Lipschitz assumption on h and since, ∀p ∈ P , Σp
is δ-ISS, from (10), ∀(x, p, l) ∈ X and ∀(ˆx, p, l) ∈ ˆX, we have

(cid:107)H(x, p, l) − ˆH(ˆx, p, l)(cid:107) = (cid:107)h(x) − ˆh(ˆx)(cid:107) ≤ (cid:96)((cid:107)x − ˆx(cid:107)) ≤ (cid:96) ◦ α−1

satisfying condition 2. Now we show condition 3 in Deﬁnition 13. From (13), ∀x ∈ X, ∀ˆx ∈ ˆX, ∀w ∈ W, ∀ ˆw ∈ ˆW ,
we have

Vp(fp(x, w), ˆx+) ≤ Vp(fp(x, w), fp(ˆx, ˆw)) + γp((cid:107)ˆx+ − fp(ˆx, ˆw)(cid:107)),

for any ˆx+ such that (ˆx+, p+, l+) ∈ ˆF((ˆx, p, l), ˆu, ˆw). Now, from Deﬁnition 17, the above inequality reduces to
Vp(fp(x, w), ˆx+) ≤ Vp(fp(x, w), fp(ˆx, ˆw)) + γp(η).

Note that by (11), one gets

Hence, ∀x ∈ X, ∀ˆx ∈ ˆX, ∀w ∈ W, ∀ ˆw ∈ ˆW , one obtains

Vp(fp(x, w), fp(ˆx, ˆw)) ≤ κpVp(x, ˆx) + ρp((cid:107)w − ˆw(cid:107)).

Vp(fp(x, w), ˆx+) ≤ κpVp(x, ˆx) + ρp((cid:107)w − ˆw(cid:107)) + γp(η),

(17)

Now, we show the condition 3(a) in Deﬁnition 13 holds. Let us consider any pair of states (x, p, l) ∈ X,
(ˆx, p, l) ∈ ˆX, satisfying V((x, p, l), (ˆx, p, l)) ≤ ε, and any w ∈ W , ˆw ∈ ˆW such that (cid:107)w − ˆw(cid:107) ≤ ϑ. Combining
(17) with (14) for any (x+, p+, l+) ∈ F((x, p, l), u, w) and any (ˆx+, p+, l+) ∈ ˆF((ˆx, p, l), ˆu, ˆw) with ˆu = u, one
obtains:

V((x+, p+, l+), (ˆx+, p+, l+)) ≤ κε + ρ(ϑ) + ˆγ(ˆγ−1((1 − κ)ε − ρ(ϑ))) = ε,

(18)

which shows that condition 3(a) is satisﬁed. Similarly, for any (ˆx+, p+, l+) ∈ ˆF((ˆx, p, l), ˆu, ˆw), condition 3(b)
is also satisﬁed using the same reasoning with (x+, p+, l+) ∈ F((x, p, l), ˆu, w). Therefore, we conclude that V
is a local ε-InitSOPSF from T (Σ) to T ( ˆΣ) .

Remark 22. If Σ admits a common δ-ISS Lyapunov function satisfying Assumption 20, then function V in
Theorem 21 reduces to V((x, p, l), (ˆx, p, l)) := V (x, ˆx).

Given the results of Theorems 14 and 21, one can see that conditions (8) and (14) may not hold at the same
time. In the following subsection, we will discuss about the inherent property that the network should have
such that one can design suitable quantization parameters to satisfy conditions (8) and (14) simultaneously.

5.2. Compositionality Result. We raise the following assumption which provides a small-gain type condi-
tion so that one can verify whether the competing conditions (8) and (14) can be satisﬁed simultaneously.
Assumption 23. Consider network I(T (Σ1), . . . , T (ΣN )) induced by N ∈ N≥1 transition systems T (Σi).
Assume that each T (Σi) and its ﬁnite abstraction T ( ˆΣi) admit a local εi-InitSOPSF Vi deﬁned in (15),
associated with functions and constants κi, αi, and ρi that appeared in Theorem 21. Deﬁne

for all i, j ∈ [1; N ], and assume that functions γij deﬁned in (19) satisfy

∀(i1, . . . , ir) ∈ {1, . . . , N }r, where r ∈ {1, . . . , N }.

(19)

(20)

Now, we show that, under the above small-gain assumption, one can always compositionally design local
quantization parameters to satisfy conditions (8) and (14) simultaneously.

Theorem 24. Suppose that Assumption 23 holds. Then, there always exist local quantization parameters ηi
and φij, ∀i, j ∈ [1; N ], as designed in Algorithm 1, such that (8) and (14) can be satisﬁed simultaneously.

Proof. First, let us note that the small-gain condition (20) implies that ∃σi ∈ K∞ satisfying ∀i ∈ [1; N ],

see [21, Theorem 5.2]. Then, from (19), we have ∀i ∈ [1; N ],

j∈Ni

{γij ◦ σj} < σi,

(21)

Next, suppose that we are given a sequence of functions σi ∈ K∞, ∀i ∈ [1; N ], satisfying (21). Assume we are
given any desired precision ε as in Deﬁnition 11. Let us set εi = σi(r), ∀i ∈ [1; N ], where r ∈ R>0 is chosen
{σi(r)} = ε. Then, we choose internal input quantization paramters φij, ∀i, j ∈ [1; N ], such
such that max

that

{φij} < ρ−1

(23)

Now, by setting ϑi = max
j∈Ni

{α−1

j (εj) + φij}, and combining (22) and (23), one has ∀i ∈ [1; N ]

ρi(ϑi) = ρi(max

{α−1

j (εj) + φij}) ≤ ρi(max
j∈Ni

{α−1

j (εj) + max
j∈Ni

{φij}) < (1 − κi)εi.

(24)

Thus, by (24), given any pair of parameters (εi, ϑi), one can always ﬁnd suitable local parameters ηi to satisfy
j (εj) + φij} ensures that (8) is satisﬁed as well, which
(14). Additionally, the selection of ϑi = max
j∈Ni
(cid:3)

{α−1

concludes the proof.

Remark 25. The compositionality result in Theorem 24 imposes a small-gain type condition on the concrete
network of switched subsystems for the existence of proper compositional ﬁnite abstraction, as depicted in
Figure 4. In particular, under such small-gain type conditions, one can always ﬁnd suitable local quantization
parameters to construct local ﬁnite abstractions. The interconnection of the local ﬁnite abstractions can be
used to serve as a ﬁnite abstraction for the concrete network satisfying the simulation relation T (Σ) (cid:22)ε T ( ˆΣ).

Remark 26. Let us provide a general guideline on the computation of K∞ functions σi, i ∈ [1; N ], that are
used in Theorem 24: (i) in a general case when the network is consisting of N ≥ 1 subsystems, functions
σi, i ∈ [1; N ], can be constructed numerically by leveraging the algorithm introduced in [22] and the technique
presented in [21, Proposition 8.8], see [23, Chapter 4]; (ii) for the case of having two and three subsystems in
the network, there have been some construction techniques proposed in [24] and [21, Section 9], respectively;
(iii) when the gain functions appeared in (19) satisfy γij < Id, ∀i, j ∈ [1; N ], then one can always choose
σi, i ∈ [1; N ] to be identity functions.

6. Illustrative Example

Here, we provide an illustrative example to show how one can leverage the proposed compositional approach
to check approximate initial-state opacity of a network of switched systems based on its ﬁnite abstraction.
Consider a network of discrete-time switched systems Σ = (X, X0, Xs, P, F, Y, h) as in Deﬁnition 4, consisting
of n subsystems Σi each described by:

Σi :

where pi(k) ∈ Pi = {1, 2}, ∀k ∈ N, denotes the modes of each subsystem Σi. The other parameters are as
the following: ai1 = 0.05, ai2 = 0.1, bi1 = 0.1, bi2 = 0.15, di = 0.05, ci = [ci1; . . . ; cin] with ci(i+1) = 1,
cij = 0, ∀i ∈ [1; n − 1], ∀j (cid:54)= i + 1, cn1 = cnn = 1, cnj = 0, ∀j ∈ [2; n − 1]. The internal inputs are subject
to the constraints ω1(k) = cn1xn(k) and ωi(k) = c(i−1)ix(i−1)(k), ∀i ∈ [2; n]. For each switched subsystem,
the state set is Xi = X0i = (0, 0.6), ∀i ∈ [1; n], the secret set is Xs1 = (0, 0.2], Xs2 = [0.4, 0.6), Xsi = (0, 0.6),
∀i ∈ [3; n], the output set is Yi = (cid:81)n
Yij where Yi(i+1) = (0, 0.6), Yii = Yij = {0}, ∀i ∈ [1; n − 1], ∀j (cid:54)= i + 1,
Ynn = Yn1 = (0, 0.6), Ynj = {0}, ∀j ∈ [2; n − 1], and internal input set is W1 = Yni, Wi = Y(i−1)i, ∀i ∈ [2; n].
Intuitively, the output of the network is the external output of the last subsystem Σn. The interconnection
topology of the network is depicted in Figure 5.

j=1

Figure 5. The interconnection topology of the network of discrete-time switched subsystems Σi.

The main goal of this example is to check approximate initial-state opacity of the concrete network using its
ﬁnite abstraction. Now, let us construct a ﬁnite abstraction of Σ compositionally with accuracy ˆε = 0.25 as
deﬁned in (7), which preserves approximate initial-state opacity. We implement our compositional approach
to achieve this goal.

It can be readily veriﬁed that (10) and (11) are satisﬁed
Consider functions Vipi = |xi − ˆxi|, ∀i ∈ [1; n].
= αipi = Id, ρipi = 0.05, ∀pi ∈ Pi, κi1 = ai1 = 0.05, κi2 = ai2 = 0.1. Condition (13) is satisﬁed
with αipi
with γipi = Id, ∀pi ∈ Pi. Moreover, since Vipi = Vip+
i ∈ Pi, Vi(xi, ˆxi) = |xi − ˆxi| is a common δ-ISS
Lyapunov function for subsystem Σi. Next, given functions κi = 0.1, ρi = 0.06Id, αi = Id, ˆγi = 1.05Id,
αi = Id as appeared in Theorem 21, we have γij < Id by (19), ∀i, j ∈ [1; n]. Hence, the small-gain condition
(20) is satisﬁed. Then, by applying Theorem 24 and choosing functions σi = Id, ∀i ∈ [1; n], such that
(21) holds, we obtain proper pairs of local parameters (εi, ϑi) = (0.25, 0.25) for all of the transition systems.
Accordingly, we provide a suitable choice of local quantization parameters as ηi = 0.2, ∀i ∈ [1; n], such that
inequality (14) for each transition system T (Σi) is satisﬁed. Then, we construct local ﬁnite abstractions
T ( ˆΣi) = ( ˆXi, ˆX0i, ˆXsi, ˆUi, ˆWi, ˆFi, ˆYi, ˆHi) as in Deﬁnition 18, where:

otherwise

j=i+2{0},

Using the result in Theorem 21, one can verify that Vi(xi, ˆxi) = |xi − ˆxi| is a local εi-InitSOPSF from
each T (Σi) to its ﬁnite abstraction T ( ˆΣi). Furthermore, by the compositionality result in Theorem 14, we
obtain that V = max
{|xi − ˆxi|} is an ε-InitSOPSF from T (Σ) = I(T (Σ1), . . . , T (Σn)) to
T ( ˆΣ) = ˆI(T ( ˆΣ1), . . . , T ( ˆΣn)) with ε = max

{Vi(xi, ˆxi)} = max

εi = 0.25.

Now, let us verify approximate initial-state opacity for T (Σ) using the network of ﬁnite abstractions T ( ˆΣ).
To do this, we ﬁrst show an example of a network consisting of 3 transition systems, as shown in Figures 6

and 7. The three automata in Figure 6 represent the ﬁnite abstractions of the local transition systems, and
the one in Figure 7 is the network of ﬁnite abstractions. Each circle is labeled by the state (top half) and
the corresponding output (bottom half). Initial states are distinguished by being the target of a sourceless
arrow. The states marked in red represent the secret states. The symbols on the edges show the switching
signals p(k) ∈ {1, 2}3 and internal inputs coming from other local transition systems. For simplicity of
demonstration, we use symbols to represent the state and output vectors, where the states of local transition
systems are denoted by q1 = [0.4], q2 = [0.2], the states of network of transition systems are denoted by

z1 = [q1; q2; q2], z2 = [q2; q2; q2], z3 = [q2; q1; q2], z4 = [q1; q1; q2],
z5 = [q2; q2; q1], z6 = [q2; q1; q1], z7 = [q1; q1; q1], z8 = [q1; q2; q1],

and the outputs of the corresponding states are represented as y = 0.2 and Y = 0.4 with the symbols
like 00y = [0; 0; 0.2], 00Y = [0; 0; 0.4] representing concatenated output vectors. One can easily see that
ˆI(T ( ˆΣ1), T ( ˆΣ2), T ( ˆΣ3)) is 0-approximate initial-state opaque, since for any run starting from any secret state,
i.e. z3 and z7, there exists a run from a non-secret state, i.e. z1 and z5, such that the output trajectories
are exactly the same. Essentially, one can verify that the abstract network holds this property regardless
of the number of systems (i.e. n), due to the homogeneity of systems Σi and the symmetry of the circular
network topology. Thus, one can conclude that T ( ˆΣ) = ˆI(T ( ˆΣ1), . . . , T ( ˆΣn)) is 0-approximate initial-state
opaque. Therefore, by Corollary 10, we obtain that the original network T (Σ) = I(T (Σ1), . . . , T (Σn)) is
0.5-approximate initial-state opaque.

7. Conclusion

In this paper, we provided a compositional framework for the construction of opacity-preserving ﬁnite abstrac-
tions for networks of discrete-time switched systems. First, an approximate initial-state opacity-preserving
simulation function (InitSOPSF) is deﬁned to characterize the simulation relation between two networks, which
facilitates the abstraction-based opacity veriﬁcation process. Then we presented a compositional approach to
construct ﬁnite abstractions locally for concrete subsystems under incremental input-to-state stability prop-
erty. The interconnection of local ﬁnite abstractions forms an abstract network that mimics the behaviors
of the concrete network while preserving opacity via the proposed InitSOPSF. Futhermore, we derived a
small-gain type condition, under which one can guarantee the existence of proper quantization parameters for
the construction of ﬁnite abstractions. For future work, we are interested in extending the compositionality
results to cover more notions of opacity, e.g., current-state opacity [25], K-step opacity [26], and inﬁnite-state
opacity [27]. Moreover, it would be an interesting direction to investigate opacity property for large-scale
switched systems with unstable mode, and also for other classes of hybrid systems, e.g., stochastic systems
and impulsive systems.
