In our more and more interconnected world, a speciﬁc risk is that of a cyber-epidemic (or cyber-
pandemic), produced either accidentally or intentionally, where a cyber virus propagates from device
to device up to undermining the global Internet system with devastating consequences in terms of
economic costs and societal harms related to the shutdown of essential services. We introduce a
compartmental model for studying the spreading of a malware and of the awareness of its incidence
through diﬀerent waves which are evolving on top of the same graph structure (the global network of
connected devices). This is realized by considering vectorial compartments made of two components,
the ﬁrst being descriptive of the state of the device with respect to the new malware’s propagation,
and the second accounting for the awareness of the device’s user about the presence of the cyber
threat. By introducing suitable transition rates between such compartments, one can then follow the
evolution of a cyber-epidemic from the moment at which a new virus is seeded in the network, up to
when a given user realizes that his/her device has suﬀered a damage and consequently starts a wave
of awareness which eventually ends up with the development of a proper antivirus software. We then
compare the overall damage that a malware is able to produce in Erdős-Rényi and scale-free network
architectures for both the case in which the virus is causing a ﬁxed damage on each device and the
case where, instead, the virus is engineered to mutate while replicating from device to device. Our
result constitute actually the attempt to build a speciﬁc compartmental model whose variables and
parameters are entirely customized for describing cyber-epidemics.

The study of compartmental models started already at
the beginning of the 20th century [1, 2, 3, 4], and soon be-
came a subject of great, recent, interest that has attracted the
attention of many epidemiologists. In analogy with cellu-
lar automata [5], these models consider a networked popu-
lation of individuals, each one of them described by a state
whose discrete values are labeled by compartments. Indi-
viduals may then progress between compartments through
given transition probabilities, which allow the time-discrete
evolution of the population during, for instance, the spread-
ing of infectious diseases and/or rumors and social conta-
gion. Physicists became interested in these models when it
was pointed out that epidemiological processes can be re-
garded as percolation like processes [6].

Starting from the seminal work by Pastor–Satorras and
Vespignani [7], the last twenty years have seen a burst of ac-
tivity on understanding the eﬀects of a network topology on
the rate and patterns of the disease spread. A lot of studies
have tried indeed to predict things such as the total number
of infected individuals, or the duration of an epidemic, and
to estimate various relevant parameters such as the repro-
ductive number. Moreover, and especially in relation to the
recent COVID19 world pandemic crisis, these models have
been used to assess the eﬀects of public health interventions

and/or to quantify the eﬃciency of issuing a limited number
of vaccines in a given population [8, 9].

In particular, the SIR model [10, 11] is one of the sim-
plest compartmental models, and describes the evolution of
diseases resulting in the immunization or death of the in-
fected individuals. The model assumes that, at each time,
each individual can be in one of three possible compart-
ments: susceptible (denoted by 𝑆), infected (𝐼), or removed
(𝑅). The susceptible units of the network are those healthy
persons that can develop the disease if they get in contact
with infected individuals. Once an individual contracts the
infection, it moves into the infected (and infective) compart-
ment, and then, after some time, into the removed compart-
ment, which indicates that the individual cannot catch the
disease anymore (or passes it on), due to a lasting resistance
conferred by the recovery (or because it dies).

Just as a viral pandemic proliferates inside a population
of individuals, a ransomware (or other malware) software
can spread within the global Internet. As technology is to-
day globally interconnected, a cyber virus can indeed prop-
agate from device to device, with devastating consequences.
Cyber attacks on infrastructure services are currently on the
rise, and hackers are exploiting the use of the Internet of
Things which creates millions of new vulnerability points
in all critical infrastructures. A speciﬁc risk is therefore the
occurrence of a cyber-epidemics (or cyber-pandemic), pro-
duced either accidentally or intentionally, and undermining

virus and of an awareness level on top of multiplex networks.
In our case, instead, we consider two dimensional vectorial
compartments, the ﬁrst component of which being the state
of the device with respect to the new malware’s propaga-
tion (𝑆 for susceptible, 𝐼 for infected, and 𝐻 for healed)
while the second component accounts for the awareness of
the device’s user about the presence of the new virus (“a” for
aware and “u” for unaware). Transition rates between such
vectorial compartments are then deﬁned to properly model
the behavior of a cyber-epidemic from the moment at which
a new (i.e., yet unknown to the good team) virus is seeded
in the network by the bad team, up to the moment at which a
given user realizes that his/her device has suﬀered a damage
and consequently starts a wave of awareness which eventu-
ally ends up with reaching one of the units of the good team.
Then, the good team develops a proper antivirus software
that the aware units download from the net for healing their
devices.

In other words, the framework we adopt is somewhat
like a vectorial version of the SIR model, where each sus-
ceptible or infected node is also either aware or unaware of
the existence of the virus. This means that one has four
),
possible states before recovery: susceptible-unaware (𝑆𝑢
susceptible-aware (𝑆𝑎
), and infected
), infected-unaware (𝐼𝑢
), see Fig. 1. Finally, the recovery or healed status
aware (𝐼𝑎
(𝐻𝑎
) can be reached only by a node (a device) whose user,
after getting aware of the existence of the virus, applies a
suitable operation on the system, for instance installing an
antivirus.

The transition probabilities between such states are me-
diated by four fundamental parameters, whose meaning is
directly linked to speciﬁc processes occurring during a cy-
ber epidemic:

• 𝜏 is the equivalent of the standard infection parameter
in the SIR model. Here, it accounts for the contact-
based transition rate from the susceptible to the in-
fected status. In the case of 𝑆𝑎
individuals, a diﬀerent
infection rate is used (𝜏′ = 𝜏∕10), due to the fact that
awareness makes individuals reluctant to be in con-
tact with infected sites/computers (for instance, email
phishing campaigns normally raise alarms in media,
making people more concerned about clicking on du-
bious links);

• 𝜈 is the rate of spreading of awareness due to network
contacts, i.e., the parameter who rules the contact-based
transition from the unaware to the aware status;

• 𝜇 accounts for the individual awareness parameter, i.e.,
the rate at which an infected unaware user actually no-
tices that his/her device has suﬀered a damage (larger
than a given threshold) due to having been infected by
a new cyber virus, and consequently turns to the in-
fected aware state and simultaneously starts signaling
the existence of a new virus circulating in the net;

• 𝛾 is the recovery/healing parameter, i.e., the rate at
which an aware (either susceptible or infected) indi-

Units of the network can be in one of four possible states
before recovery: susceptible-unaware (𝑆𝑢), susceptible-aware

the global Internet system up to the need of its lockdown.
The World Economic Forum [12] predicted that a single day
without Internet would cost around 50 billion USD glob-
ally, without even considering the societal harm related to
the shutdown of essential services.

Since the ﬁrst attempt to describe the spreading of com-
puter viruses [13], several other studies have tried to adapt
classical, global or networked, compartmental models with
the aim not only of investigating the propagation cycle of cy-
ber viruses but also to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of possible
security countermeasures [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. There
is, however, a fundamental diﬀerence between the spread-
ing of a biological virus within a population and a cyber-
epidemic. In the former case, indeed, each individual is pas-
sive actor of the game, contracting the disease and recov-
ering from it due to the action of its immune system. The
latter case can instead be seen as the struggle between two
kind of actors: the ones who intentionally program the mali-
cious code and try to seed it within the global Internet (that
we will call from here after as the “bad team”) and those
(that we will call from here after as the “good team”) who
are instead engaged in programming the corresponding an-
tivirus code after becoming aware of the presence of the new
malware in the network, and in spreading it to all network’s
users.

In this paper, we introduce a novel compartmental model,
whose variables and parameters are entirely customized for
the case of a cyber-epidemic. We will then compare the
spreading of a malware on top of Erdős-Rényi (connected)
and scale-free network architectures for both the case in which
the virus is producing a ﬁxed damage on each device and the
case where, instead, the virus is engineered to mutate while
replicating from device to device.

In our model, both the spreading of malware and aware-
ness occurs through waves developing and evolving within
the same graph structure (the global network of connected
devices). Notice that this diﬀerentiates our approach from
that of Ref. [21] which describes the dynamical interplay of a

to the state 𝐼𝑎

In order to properly monitor how damaging a cyber-epidemic

can be in a network of devices, we introduce as a further pa-
rameter the damage 𝑑 ∈ [0, 1] caused when a device is in-
fected by the virus, and we quantify the total damage caused
to the system as the sum of the damages made to each single
device. Finally, as the 𝜇 parameter is totally related to the
damage produced in a device, it is appropriate to deﬁne it
to be proportional to the 𝑑 parameter. In addition, in order
to account for the fact that there may be situations where the
virus damage is not perceived at all by the user and the device
continues to function correctly even with high damage or, on
the opposite, cases (like, for instance, in high sensitivity in-
frastructures) where just a little damage constitutes an alarm
on the existence of the virus, the parameter 𝜇 is activated
depending on whether it exceeds a threshold 𝜃 ∈ [0, 1]. The
latter lead to the following expression with 𝜇0 ∈ [0, 1]:

{

𝜇 =

𝜇0(𝑑 − 𝜃) if 𝑑 ≥ 𝜃,
𝜇 = 0 if 𝑑 < 𝜃.

As for the threshold 𝜃, the higher it is the more damage
individual systems can withstand before realizing the pres-
ence of the virus. If the threshold is at a low value (as, for
instance, in high security infrastructures or clusters) a dam-
age as small as the deletion of a couple of ﬁles in the sys-
tem is already suﬃcient to trigger an alarm. If, instead, the
threshold is high, then a few ﬁles missing would be taken as
an error, but a large system failure would actually be under-
stood as the consequence of a virus. Lower thresholds are
therefore always preferable for protecting an overall system
from damage, but in practice they are overcostly as they need
more investments in infrastructure protection and even more
employees to maintain it.

From the ﬁgure, one can clearly distinguish the three dif-
ferent stages of the cycle: an initial stage of no awareness
where more and more nodes are infected (passing from the

erage degree ⟨𝑘⟩ = 10, threshold 𝜃 = 0.2 and constant damage
𝑑 = 0.3. See Table 1 for the values of the other parameters
used. It is possible to distinguish three diﬀerent phases of the
cycle: an initial phase of no awareness where more and more
nodes pass from the 𝑆𝑢 to the 𝐼𝑢 state; a second stage, the
awareness phase starting at around 𝑡 ∼ 30, when a given 𝐼𝑢
node becomes 𝐼𝑎 and ignites an awareness wave so that the
total number of both 𝐼𝑎 and 𝑆𝑎 grows by contact transitions;
a ﬁnal healing stage where all nodes turn to the 𝐻𝑎 state.

vidual gets healed by purging of the system via the
installation of a proper antivirus.

Two types of transitions may therefore occur in our model:
contact-based transitions and individual (or contact-indepen-
dent) ones. In individual transitions, the change of state is
fully independent of the states of the rest of the devices, but
is only due to the perception of the damage caused to the de-
vice (in the case of the passage from the state 𝐼𝑢
to the state
at rate 𝜇) and/or the user’s interest in using an antivirus

(in the case of the passage from any aware state to the state

at rate 𝛾).

duced by the cyber virus in its device, a second wave (which

In order to quantify the total injury produced in the sys-

duce the quantity 𝐷∕𝑁 accounting for the normalized sum
of the individual damages suﬀered by each node. Its value is
obtained with multiplying 𝑑 by the total number of infected
nodes during a cycle (regardless on whether they are in the
state 𝐼𝑢
), and dividing by 𝑁. When 𝑑 is below the
threshold 𝜃 the presence of the cyber threat is never detected
and, as a consequence, the virus will propagate to all nodes
in the network yielding 𝐷∕𝑁 = (𝑁 ⋅ 𝑑)∕𝑁 = 𝑑. A non triv-
ial behavior is instead observed for all values 𝑑 > 𝜃, where
the awareness mechanism is activated at a given time in the
cycle.

or 𝐼𝑎

As a ﬁrst step, we face the problem of assessing how
diﬀerent topologies of the network react to a virus (causing
a constant damage 𝑑 when infecting a device) at diﬀerent
values of the threshold 𝜃.

⟨𝑘⟩

With the aim of comparing homogeneous and heteroge-
neous topologies Fig. 3 illustrates the results of our simula-
tions, and reports 𝐷∕𝑁 vs. 𝑑 for Barabási-Albert [23, 24]
scale free and Erdős-Rényi [25] random networks, at diﬀer-
ent values of the mean degree
and diﬀerent values of 𝜃.
A ﬁrst, even though rather trivial, evidence is that the global
damage is higher for higher values of 𝜃, indicating that the
harder it is for nodes to become aware, the more free is the
cyber threat to propagate without countermeasures. More-
over, a noticeable diﬀerence is observed regarding the posi-
tion of the maximum damage that a virus can deal in a given
system, being it located at 𝑑 = 1 for low thresholds and at
𝑑 = 𝜃 for high thresholds. Finally, and more remarkably,
the results shown in Fig. 3 allow to conclude that Barabási-

Albert scale free (i.e., heterogenous) networks are more frag-
ile, and more sensitive to the spreading of viruses causing a
ﬁxed damage than Erdős-Rényi (i.e., homogenous) ones, so
that a ﬁrst conclusion is that engineering a network in a scale
free topology renders it more vulnerable to cyber-epidemics,
in line with what was already known about their structural
fragility against intentional attacks [26]. On the other hand,
it is seen that, regardless on the speciﬁc network topology,
the higher is the average degree the higher is the graph’s vul-
nerability. Already at this qualitative level, a ﬁrst conclusion
can be drawn: if the threshold is high, inﬂicting maximal
injury to a system requires some tuning on the side of the
bad team (the virus designers), with the ideal value of the
damage to be caused at each single device being that of the
threshold. On the opposite, if the threshold is low, then a
high base damage virus is able to inﬂict a huge damage on
the network regardless on the speciﬁc threshold value.

We then move to consider the eﬀects of a damage which
is variable in time, that is, 𝑑 = 𝑑(𝑡), where 𝑡 is a discrete
time measuring the number of iterations in the model (a time
unit being the lapse from one to another iteration of the net-
works’ nodes). Namely, starting at 𝑑0 = 0.1, the damage is
increased in times as

𝑑(𝑡) =

𝑑0𝑒𝜀𝑡
1 + 𝑑0(𝑒𝜀𝑡 − 1)

,

(1)

for some 𝜀 > 0. Note that the function 𝑑(𝑡) is the logis-
tic function with growth rate 𝜀, initial population 𝑑0
and
carrying capacity 1, so that it displays an exponential be-
havior (𝑑(𝑡) ≈ 𝑑0𝑒𝜀𝑡) when 𝑡 ≈ 0 and approaches 1 when
𝑡 → ∞. Choosing the logistic function as the damage func-
tion is ideal in the model, as the intentions of the bad team
is precisely that of spawning as much damage as possible
before the virus is detected by users.

degrees and diﬀerent values of 𝜃. For comparison, in the
same ﬁgure the maximum possible injury caused to the sys-
tem by a ﬁxed strength virus is reported by horizontal dashed
lines. One can easily see that, as a function of 𝜀, 𝐷∕𝑁 dis-
plays an initial monotonic growth and an asymptotic behav-
ior for 𝜀 → 1, featuring a local maximum for some 0 <
̄𝜀 < 1. Remarkably, one can notice that for low values of
the threshold, there is a range of 𝜀 for which the amount
of injury inﬂicted to the system is actually higher than the
maximum at constant base damage. This implies that the
bad team has the option of causing a higher injury on a high
security system by just engineering the virus with an inter-
nal clock, which would progressively increase the damage
inﬂicted to infected devices. On the contrary, at high val-
ues of 𝜃 (i.e., when security is not so demanding), viruses
whose base damage is given by Eq. (1) cause an overall in-
jury which is comparable with the maximal value at constant
damage strength.

Finally, we brieﬂy describe the scenario in which the
virus is engineered to increase its base damage not due to
an internal clock, but due to a mutation that occurs all the
times the virus is transmitted from an infected device to a
susceptible one. This is tantamount to say that, when a de-
vice is infected at time 𝑡, the damage caused depends on the

The results are reported in Fig. 5, where 𝐷∕𝑁 is plotted
vs. 𝜀 for the case of a mutating virus. One can see that the
emerging qualitative scenario is similar to that of time vary-
ing viruses, in that one has an initial growth and an asymp-
totic behavior with a local maximum in between. Moreover,
we again observe that for low thresholds a range of 𝜀 val-
ues exists for which the injury to the system is higher than
the case of a constant base damage whereas at high thresh-
olds a virus with ﬁxed base damage is more harmful. The

the other ruled by the respective probabilities. Unless otherwise spec-
iﬁed, the reported numerical results refer to an ensemble average over
500 diﬀerent network realizations of 𝑛 = 1000 nodes each, and a fur-
ther ensemble average over 20 initial conditions per network (i.e., 20
diﬀerent random positions where the initial seed of infected-unaware
is placed).

injury to the system than mutating virus.

In conclusion, we have introduced a novel compartmen-
tal model able to describe the spreading of a malware (and
of the awareness of its incidence) on a given network of de-
vices. The novelty of our approach consists in having con-
sidered vectorial compartments made of two components,
the ﬁrst being descriptive of the state of the device with re-
spect to the virus propagation, and the second accounting
for the awareness of the device’s user about the presence of
the cyber threat. The model allows to follow the evolution
of a cyber-epidemic from the moment at which a malware is
seeded in a network of devices, until when a given user gets
aware of the incurred damage and starts a wave of aware-
ness which eventually leads to the development of a proper
antivirus software. We then illustrate the overall injury that
a malware is able to produce in Erdős-Rényi and scale-free
architectures for both the case in which the virus is caus-
ing a ﬁxed damage on each device and the case in which,
instead, the virus is engineered to mutate while replicating
from device to device. As our world is more and more in-
terconnected, a cyber-epidemic is a dangerous threat, where
a cyber virus would undermine the global Internet system
with catastrophic consequences. Our results are the attempt
to describe, in a customized way, the evolution of such pan-
demic, and our conclusion may give hints on how to properly
engineer a network of devices to minimize its vulnerability.
