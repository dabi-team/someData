Abstract

Next-generation communication networks will likely involve the energy-efﬁcient transfer of information and

energy over the same wireless channel, for which the physical layer will become more vulnerable to cyber attacks

by potential multi-antenna eavesdroppers. To address this issue, this paper considers transmit time-switching (TS)

mode, in which energy and information signals are transmitted separately in time by the BS. This protocol is

not only easy to implement but also delivers the opportunity of multi-purpose beamforming, in which energy

beamformers during wireless power transfer are useful in jamming the eavesdropper. In the presence of imperfect

channel estimation and multi-antenna eavesdroppers, the energy and information beamformers and the transmit TS

ratio are jointly optimized to maximize the worst-case user secrecy rate subject to UEs harvested energy thresholds

and a BS transmit power budget. New robust path-following algorithms, which involve one simple convex quadratic

program at each iteration are proposed for computational solutions of this difﬁcult optimization problem and also

the problem of secure energy efﬁciency maximization. The latter is further complex due to additional optimization

variables appearing in the denominator of the secrecy rate function. Numerical results conﬁrm that the performance

of the proposed computational solutions is robust against the channel uncertainties.

I. INTRODUCTION

Next-generation communication networks offers the potential to transfer information and energy through

the same wireless communication channel, where energy constrained users (UEs) would be able to not

only receive information but also harvest energy [1]–[3]. The information transfer generally aims at high

signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) while the energy transfer aims at a high-power ambient

signal [4], [5]. In early developments, information and energy are excited to be transferred simultaneously

(at the same time) by the same signalling. To realize both wireless energy harvesting (EH) and information

decoding (ID), the user’s receivers need to split the received signal for EH and ID either by power splitting

(PS) or time switching (TS) [6], [7]. Our recent result in [8] shows that such protocol, particularly the PS

approach at the receiver, is not only complicated and inefﬁcient for practical implementation, but also not

necessary. It is much more efﬁcient to transfer information and energy separately and the users’s receivers

do not need any sophisticated device.

Wireless power transfer is more viable in sensor-networks or in dense small-cell deployment where

there is closer proximity between BS and UEs. Such densiﬁcation of wireless network make the wireless

devices more vulnerable to malicious cyber attacks than ever [9], [10]. The eavesdropper can be more

powerful as equipped by multi-antenna and in favorable channel condition. The information intended

to users of less favorable channel condition can be vulnerably leaked. Physical layer security aims to

secure data transmissions in such networks [11]–[13]. Many recent works considered looking into the

beamforming design problem to maximize secrecy rate under the BS transmit power budget [14]–[17].

Beamforming requires the knowledge of downlink channels to the UEs, which can be obtained via channel

estimation. Due to channel estimation errors in practical systems, the BS cannot expect perfect channel

3

knowledge, which demands for robust beamforming design in the presence of channel uncertainties [14],

[16]. Adding wireless energy harvesting (EH) feature due to its viability in dense small-cell deployment

introduces another EH constraint in secrecy rate optimization problem [18]. As mentioned above, physical

layer security becomes more relevant in wireless information and power transfer systems.

Robust beamforming design in the presence of channel uncertainties with the same objective of secrecy

rate maximization under receiver EH thresholds in addition to BS transmit power budget was recently

considered in [19]–[22]. Some of these works assume either only EH feature or only ID capability at the

UEs [20], [21], so there were no PS or TS based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer

(SWIPT) receivers. Assuming PS-based SWIPT receivers, secrecy rate maximization was studied in [19],

[22]. At griding points of normal rates, these works employ semi-deﬁnite programming and alternating

optimization, where rank-one constraints have to be dropped and computationally complex matrices have

to be optimized. Randomization has to be employed to achieve feasible beamforming vectors [22]. As

already pointed out by [23] while ago, such randomization approach is not quite efﬁcient. Moreover, with

the existing PS approach, it is well known that it is not practically easy to implement variable range

power splitter and also, one can not jam the eavesdropper without transmitting artiﬁcial noise [8]. In

contrast, as shown in the present paper, our recently proposed transmit TS approach [8] does not require

to transmit extra artiﬁcial noise thanks to the fact that power-bearing signal sent during EH time can be

simultaneously used to jam the eavesdropper.

Meanwhile, energy efﬁciency (EE) in terms of bits per Joule per Hertz is also a very important ﬁgure-

of-merit in assessing the practicability of next communication networks and beyond (see e.g. [24]–[29]),

where the Dinkelbach-type algorithm [30] of fractional programming is the main tool for obtaining

computational solutions (see e.g. [31], [32] and references therein). In the presence of eavesdroppers,

secrecy energy efﬁciency (SEE) maximization has been studied recently in [33], [34]. However, the

approach to treat SEE in [33], [34] is based on costly beamformers, which completely cancel the multi-

user interference and wiretapped signal at the eavesdroppers. Moving step ahead, energy harvesting brings

4

in conﬂicting requirements form the viewpoint of EE, as it requires a stronger transmit power. The problem

of energy efﬁciency maximization in SWIPT systems has been recently studied in [35]–[37]. However,

either the authors don’t consider simultaneous EH and ID capability [37] or assume PS based receiver

[35], [36]. To the best of our knowledge, computational solution for robust beamforming design to achieve

secrecy rate and SEE optimization, particularly assuming practical TS-based wireless EH systems, is still

an open problem. The SEE objective is not a ratio of concave and convex functions, for which the

Dinkelbach’s algorithm based approach is very inefﬁcient.

The subject of this paper is a multicell network, where the UEs in each cell are divided into two groups

depending upon their distance from the serving BS. The one closer to the BS take the advantage of higher

received power to perform wireless EH in addition to ID while the far-away users only conduct ID. We

consider imperfect channel state information (CSI) case where the BSs have imperfect channel knowledge

about UEs and eavesdroppers. We implement transmit TS approach [8] where BS transmits information

and energy separately in different time portions and the energy beamformers can be exploited to jam the

eavesdroppers.1 In the presence of channel uncertainties, we formulate the worst-case based robust secrecy

rate optimization problem. We solve for joint optimization of information and energy beamforming vectors

with the transmit TS ratio, that could maximize the minimum secrecy rate among all users, while ensuring

EH constraints for near-by users and transmit power constraints at the BSs. The problem is very difﬁcult

computationally due many challenging constraints, for which a path-following algorithm is developed for

its computational solution. The algorithm does not require rank-constrained optimization and converges

quite quickly in few iterations. Through extensive simulation, the achieved secrecy rate is shown to be

close to the normal rate that excludes the presence of eavesdroppers. Furthermore, our numerical results

conﬁrm that performance of the proposed algorithm is close to that of the perfect channel knowledge

case. In addition, the proposed algorithm not only outperforms the existing algorithm that models power-

1Though we propose transmit TS approach to solve max-min rate and power minimization problems in [8], however, the extension of

those developed algorithms to solve robust secrecy rate and energy efﬁciency maximization problem in the presence of eavesdroppers and

channel estimation errors (as will be detailed shortly in this paper) is highly non-trivial.

splitting (PS) based receiver but also the proposed transmit TS based model is implementation-wise quite

simple than the PS-based model. In the end, we extend our development to solve and analyze robust SEE

maximization problem, which is further complex due to additional function of optimization variables in

the denominator of secrecy rate function.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the problem formulation for maximizing the worst-

case user secrecy rate and its challenges, whereas Section III develops its computational solution. Section

IV proposes a computational solution for the EE maximization. Section V evaluates the performance of

our proposed algorithms by numerical examples. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

Consider a multicell network consisting of K small cells labeled by k ∈ K (cid:44) {1, . . . , K}. As shown

in Fig. 1, in each cell k, a multi-antenna BS k with M antennas communicates with Nk single-antenna

users (UEs) (k, n), n ∈ Nk (cid:44) {1, . . . , Nk} over the same bandwidth. We divide the users in each cell

k into two zones, such that there are N1,k users located nearby serving BS k in zone-1 and N2,k users

are located far from the BS k in zone-2, where Nk = N1,k + N2,k. By UE (k, n1) and UE (k, n2), we

mean UE n1 ∈ N1,k (cid:44) {1, . . . , N1,k} in zone-1 and UE n2 ∈ N2,k (cid:44) {N1,k + 1, . . . , Nk} in zone-2 of cell

k, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1, we assume that for UEs (k, n) of cell k, there is a single

eavesdropper k with Nev antennas in zone-1, who eavesdrops upon the signals intended for UEs (k, n).

BSs intend to transfer energy to only their zone-1 users since they are located sufﬁciently near to their

serving BSs and are able to practically harvest energy. Information is transmitted to both zone-1 and zone-

2 users. Denote by xE

k,n1

∈ CM ×1 and xI

k,n ∈ CM ×1 the EH beamforming vector and ID beamforming

vectors by BS k for its UE (k, n1) and UE (k, n), respectively. The channel (cid:101)h¯k,k,n ∈ CM ×1 between BS ¯k

and UE (k, n) is assumed to be frequency ﬂat fading, which counts the effects of both large-scale pathloss

and small-scale fading. Denote sE

k,n1 and sI

k,n as the energy signal and information signal intended for UE

(k, n1) and UE (k, n) by BS k, with E{|sE

Lower Approximation of the Objective (28a): For concave lower approximation of ¯fk,n(x, µ), which

i.e. (x((cid:96)+1), µ((cid:96)+1)) is a feasible point, which is better than (x((cid:96)), µ((cid:96))) for (22), whenever (x((cid:96)+1), µ((cid:96)+1)) (cid:54)=

(x((cid:96)), µ((cid:96))). On the other hand, if (x((cid:96)+1), µ((cid:96)+1)) = (x((cid:96)), µ((cid:96))), i.e. (x((cid:96)), µ((cid:96))) is the optimal solution of the

16

convex optimization problem (41) then it must satisfy the ﬁrst order necessary optimality condition for

(41), which obviously is also the ﬁrst order necessary optimality condition for (22). We thus proved that

the sequence {(x((cid:96)), µ((cid:96)))} converges to a point satisfying the ﬁrst order necessary optimality condition

for the nonconvex optimization problem (22).

A feasible point (cid:0)xE,(0), xI,(0), µ(0)(cid:1) for (22) (and hence (14)) for initializing Algorithm 1 is found as

as follows. We ﬁrst ﬁx µ(0) and solve the following convex problem:

until a positive value of the objective function is achieved. If either problem (43) is found infeasible or

an positive value by solving (44) is not found, we use different value of µ(0) and repeat the above process

until a feasible point (cid:0)xE,(0), xI,(0), µ(0)(cid:1) is obtained.5

5Our simulation results in Sec. V show that the initialization problems (43) or (44) are feasible, and in almost all of the scenarios

considered, we achieve a positive optimal value of (44) in one single iteration and with the ﬁrst tried value of µ(0) = 1.11.

where ξ is the constant power ampliﬁer efﬁciency, PA is the power dissipation at each transmit antenna,

to ensure quality of service. The security and energy efﬁciency are combined into a single objective in

(45a) to express the so-called secrecy EE (SEE) in terms of secrecy bits per Joule per Hertz.

The conventional approach to address (45) (see e.g. [31], [32]) is based on the Dinkelbach’s method

of fractional programming [30] to ﬁnd τ > 0 such that the optimal value of the following optimization

problem is zero

However, for each ﬁxed τ > 0, the optimization problem (46) is highly nonconvex convex and thus is still

difﬁcult computationally. It is important to realize that the original Dinkelbach’s method [30] is attractive

only for maximizing a ratio of a convex and concave functions over a convex set, under which each

subproblem for ﬁxed τ is an easy convex optimization problem. It is hardly useful whenever either the

objective is not ratio of a concave and convex function or the constrained set is not convex.

We now develop an efﬁcient path-following computational procedure for solution of (45), which

bypasses such difﬁcult optimization problem (46). Using the variable change (16) again, this problem

Algorithm 2 outlines the steps to solve max-min energy efﬁciency problem (47) (and hence (45)). Similar

to Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2 generates a sequence (cid:8)(cid:0)xE,((cid:96)), xI,((cid:96)), t((cid:96)), µ((cid:96))(cid:1)(cid:9) of improved points of (53),

by a feasibility problem (53b), (53c), and (53d). It was already reported in Section III that how efﬁciently

the solution of (43) and (44) is obtained. The solution to the feasibility problem (53b), (53c), and (53d)

is mostly obtained at the ﬁrst iteration.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS

To analyze the proposed algorithms through simulations, a network topology as shown in Fig. 2 is set

up. There are K = 3 cells and N = Nk = 4, ∀ k ∈ K UEs per cell with two placed inside the inner-circle

in zone-1 and the remaining two placed in the outer zone near cell-edges, i.e., N1,k = N2,k = 2, ∀ k.

The cell radius is set to be 40m with inner circle radius of 15m. A single Nev = 2-antennas eavesdropper

is randomly placed inside the inner circle in each cell. The path loss exponent is set to be µ = 3. We

generate Rician fading channels with Rician factor, KR = 10 dB [3]. For simplicity, set emin
k,n1

≡ emin for

the energy harvesting thresholds and ζk,n1 ≡ ζ, ∀k, n1 for the energy harvesting conversion. Further, we

set energy conversion efﬁciency ζ = 0.5, noise variance σ2

a = −90 dBm (unless speciﬁed otherwise),

maximum BS transmit power P max

k = 26 dBm, ∀ k, which is in line with the frequently made assumption

for the power budget of small-cell BSs [50]. We choose the value P max = 30 dBm of the power budget for

the whole network. Unless stated otherwise, we choose the uncertainty in eavesdroppers’ and neighboring

users’ channels, (cid:15)0 = 0.005 and we choose the uncertainty in serving users’ channels (cid:15)1 = 10−3. It is

justiﬁed to assume that BSs can achieve good channel estimates for their serving cell users compared to the

neighboring cell users in a dense small cell network. Later in this section, we also investigate the effect of

different values of channel uncertainties on the achievable secrecy rate. For energy efﬁciency maximization

problem in Section IV, we choose power ampliﬁer efﬁciency ξ = 0.2, is the power dissipation at each

transmit antenna PA = 0.6W (27.78 dBm), and circuit power consumption Pc = 2.5W (33.97 dBm) [37],

[51]. We set the threshold secrecy rate rk,n = 0.1 bits/sec/Hz for M = 4 antennas at the BS and otherwise

rk,n = 0.5 bits/sec/Hz for M ∈ {5, 6} antenna-BSs.

The convergence of Algorithm 1 for M = 5 antenna BS and minimum energy harvesting threshold

emin = −20 dBm is shown by Fig. 3. We can see that for some ﬁxed channel, whether we assume perfect

channel estimation (cid:15)0 = 0, (cid:15)1 = 0 or assume some channel uncertainty (cid:15)0 = 0.005, (cid:15)0 = 10−3, Algorithm

1 converges within 20 − 25 iterations. We also observe that if we assume the absence of eavesdropper,

Algorithm 1 quickly converges in about 4 iterations. On average, Algorithm 1 requires 22.5 iterations

before convergence, while the absence of eavesdroppers drops down the average required number of

iterations to 3.5. The slower convergence in the presence of eavesdroppers is expected since then, not

only the objective (41a) gets quite complicated, but also new constraints, (35), (37), and (38) are required

to be satisﬁed.

The worst secrecy and normal rates (in the absence of eavesdroppers) for both perfect channel estimation

(cid:15)0 = 0, (cid:15)1 = 0 and with the presence of channel uncertainty of (cid:15)0 = 0.005, (cid:15)1 ∈ 10−3 are provided by Figs.

4 and 5. Basically, the secrecy rate by Algorithm 1 is compared with the normal rate. The latter excludes

eavesdroppers and accordingly the optimization problem (14) with f 2

k,n(x, η) ≡ 0 in (14a) is solved. The

dashed curves in Figs. 4 and 5 have been plotted to refer to the presence of channel uncertainties, while

solid line curves refer to the absence of channel uncertainty (cid:15)0 = 0, (cid:15)1 = 0. We can observe from Figs. 4

and 5 that the proposed robust secrecy rate algorithm in the presence of channel uncertainties perform quite

well and close to the case that assumes perfect channel estimation. However, the performance gap increases

by increasing the number of antennas as can be seen from Fig. 4. It is expected because increasing the

number of antennas, say from M = 4 to M = 5 increases the channel uncertainty in additional KN = 12

channel co-efﬁcients. Moreover, we observe that the optimized rate by the proposed Algorithm 1 is quite

close to that achieved by the modiﬁed algorithm, which assumes absence of eavesdroppers in Algorithm

1. Fig. 4 plots the rate for different number of BS antennas M ∈ {4, 5, 6} with ﬁxed EH threshold

emin = −20 dBm, while Fig. 5 plots the rate for varying values of EH targets emin ∈ {−25, −20, . . . , 0}

dBm with ﬁxed number of antennas at the BS M = 5. In Fig. 4, we observe almost linear increase in

the achievable rate with increase in the number of BS antennas. In Fig. 5, we observe decrease in the

achievable rate with the increase in the EH targets. This is because higher EH targets demands for more

power from the BS to perform energy harvesting, which results in the decrease in the available power for

information decoding, thus decreases the achievable information rate. Overall, Figs. 4 and 5 indicate the

robustness of our proposed Algorithm 1.

for ﬁxed (cid:15)1 = 10−3, while Fig. 7 plots such rates versus different levels of channel uncertainty in serving BS

users’ channels (cid:15)0 = {10−5, . . . , 10−2} for ﬁxed (cid:15)0 = 0.005. We set energy harvesting threshold emin = −20

dBm and number of BS antennas M = 5. We can observe from Figs. 6 and 7 that the optimized rate

is almost un-affected for low channel uncertainties {10−5, . . . , 10−3}, and is slightly reduced if channel

uncertainty is increased to the level of 10−2. This advocates the robustness of Algorithm 1. Even for wide

range of values of channel uncertainty (cid:15)0, the optimized secrecy rate by Algorithm 1 is quite close to that

achieved by the modiﬁed algorithm, which assumes absence of eavesdroppers in Algorithm 1.

Fig. 8 compares the secrecy rate performance of the proposed transmit TS-based system with that of

the power splitting (PS)-based system [18] under the perfect channel state information ((cid:15)0 = 0, (cid:15)1 = 0).

For the PS-based receiver in [18], we set the ID circuit noise variance σ2

c to be −90 dBm and the antenna

noise variance σ2

a = −90 dBm. Thus, for fair comparison in Fig. 8, we add σ2

c to σ2

a, i.e., σ2

a = −87 dBm,

for plotting the result for our proposed TS-based Algorithm 1. Fig. 8 plots the worst secrecy rate versus

number of antennas M for ﬁxed energy harvesting threshold emin = −20 dBm. We can clearly observe

a gain of around 0.5 bits/sec/Hz in the achieved secrecy rate of Algorithm 1 compared to that of the

algorithm in [18]. Note that the proposed TS-based system not only enjoys the performance gain, but also

promises implementation simplicity. The average number of iterations required for convergence are almost

same for both Algorithm 1 and the algorithm in [18]. However, the proposed TS-based system model

has a two-fold advantage; it not only enjoys the performance gain, but also promises implementation

simplicity, as motivated in the Introduction in Section I.

The computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1 is O (iA1(M K(N + N1) + 1)3 (7KN

+(K + 2) + 3KN1)) [52]. Here, iA1 = 22.5 is the average number of times that (41) is solved by

Algorithm 1. Table I shows the average number of iterations, scalar variables, and linear and quadratic

constraints required to solve per iteration by the proposed Algorithm 1 and the PS-based algorithm in

[18]. We can observe that though the PS-based algorithm in [18] requires the solution of fewer quadratic

and linear constraints, it is not practically easy to implement a variable range power splitter. Thus, the

proposed TS-based Algorithm 1 provides a practical solution to secure and robust beamforming.

Finally, the performance of our proposed SEE Algorithm 2 is evaluated. Fig. 9 shows the convergence

of proposed Algorithm 2 for M = 5 antennas at the BS and energy harvesting threshold emin = −20

dBm. We can see that for some ﬁxed channel, whether we assume perfect channel estimation (cid:15)0 = 0,

(cid:15)1 = 0 or assume some channel uncertainty (cid:15)0 = 0.005, (cid:15)0 = 10−3, Algorithm 2 converges within 20 − 25

iterations. On average, Algorithm 2 requires approximately 18.5 iterations for convergence.

f 2
k,n(x, η) ≡ 0. The dashed curves in Figs. 10 and 11 refer to the presence of channel uncertainties

(cid:15)0 = 0.005, (cid:15)1 = 10−3, while solid line curves refer to the absence of channel uncertainty (cid:15)0 = (cid:15)1 = 0. We

can observe from Figs. 10 and 11 that the optimized EE by the proposed Algorithm 2 is quite close to that

achieved by the modiﬁed algorithm, which assumes absence of eavesdroppers in Algorithm 2. Finally,

we observe from Fig. 10 that for perfect channel estimation, the optimized EE increases by increasing

the number of antennas, as per expectation, however, in the presence of channel uncertainties, the EE

decreases with the increase in the number of antennas. In order to investigate this, we have ﬁgured out

the numerator and denominator of EE function separately in the next two ﬁgures.

In Figs. 12 and 13, we plot the numerator and denominator of the EE function, (45a), respectively,

where numerator of EE corresponds to the sum-rate of the worst cell and denominator of EE corresponds

to the total power, 1

ξ gk(xk, η) + M PA + Pc, of the worst cell’s BS. First, we can obersve from Fig. 13 that

EE function, (45a). Next, we can observe from Fig. 12 that though the numerator part of EE function

also increases with the increase in the number of antennas, however, the numerator part increases swiftly

for the prefect channel estimation case (solid lines) when compared to its slow increase in the presence

of channel uncertainties (dashed lines). This results in slight decrease in the EE with the increase in the

number of antennas in the presence of erroneous estimates, as shown in Fig. 10.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Considering simple and efﬁcient transmit TS approach to ensure wireless energy harvesting and in-

formation decoding in a dense multi-cell network, we have proposed robust secrecy rate and secrecy

energy efﬁciency maximization algorithms in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers and channel

estimation errors. Our robust optimization algorithm jointly designs for transmit energy and information

beamformers at the BSs and the transmit TS ratio with the objective of maximizing the worst-case user

secrecy rate under BS transmit power and UE minimum harvested energy constraints. The problem is

very challenging due to nonconvex objective and numerous non-convex constraints. We have solved it

by a new robust path-following algorithm, which involves one simple convex quadratic program in each

iteration. We have also extended our algorithm to solve for worst cell secrecy EE maximization problem

under secrecy rate quality-of-service constraints, which is further complex due to additional function of

optimization variables in the denominator of secrecy rate function. Our numerical results conﬁrm the

merits of the proposed algorithms as their performance is quite close to that of the case where there

are no eavesdroppers. Moreover, the proposed algorithm not only outperforms the existing algorithm

that models PS based receiver but also the proposed transmit TS based model is implementation-wise

quite simple than the PS-based model. Finally, we would like to hint towards an open future research

direction from this work, in which the proposed algorithms could be modiﬁed to accommodate only

channel distribution knowledge about the eavesdroppers. The rate-energy trade-off between transmit-TS

and receive-PS approaches could also be considered in future research.

We ﬁrst prove (30) by using the following inequality for all x > 0, ¯x > 0, t > 0 and ¯t > 0

ln(1 + 1/x)
t

≥ f (¯x, ¯t) + (cid:104)∇f (¯x, ¯t), (x, t) − (¯x, ¯t)(cid:105)

which follows from the convexity of function ln(1+1/x)

By subsituting 1/x → x and 1/¯x → ¯x in (A.1), we have:

k,n (xI, µ) is concave on

Next, (34) follows from the following inequality

ln(1 + t) ≤ ln(1 + t(cid:48)) + (t − t(cid:48))/(1 + t(cid:48)) ∀t ≥ 0, t(cid:48) ≥ 0,

which is a consequence of the concavity of function ln(1 + t).

Now, it remains to prove (21). By substituting ¯qk,n(x, µ), deﬁned in (21), into the constraint (36), we
