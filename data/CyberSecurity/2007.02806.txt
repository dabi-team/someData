EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global lockdown with severe health and

economical consequences. As a result, authorities around the globe have expressed their

needs for better tools to monitor the spread of the virus and to support human labor.

Researchers and technology companies such as Google and Apple have offered to

develop such tools in the form of contact tracing applications running on smartphones.

The goal of these applications is to continuously track people's proximity and to make

the smartphone users aware if they have ever been in contact with positively diagnosed

people, so that they could self-quarantine and possibly have an infection test.  

A fundamental challenge with these smartphone-based contact tracing technologies is

to ensure the security and privacy of

their users. Moving from manual

to

smartphone-based contact tracing creates new cyber risks that could suddenly affect the

entire population. Major risks include for example the abuse of the people’s private data

by companies and/or authorities, or the spreading of wrong alerts by malicious users in

order to force individuals to go into quarantine. The Swiss population is concerned

about these new risks and, according to a recent

, 40% of interviewees fear

​

that a smartphone-based contact tracing system could be turned into mass surveillance

and believe that such an approach will simply not work with too many false

notifications. 

In April 2020, the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) was

announced with the goal to develop and evaluate secure solutions for European

countries. However, after a while, several team members left this consortium and

created DP-3T which has led to an international debate among the experts on how to

securely implement contact tracing applications. At this time, it is confusing for the

non-expert to follow this debate; this report aims to shed light on the various proposed

technologies by providing an objective assessment of the cybersecurity and privacy

risks. We first review the state-of-the-art in digital contact tracing technologies and then

explore the risk-utility trade-offs of the techniques proposed for COVID-19. We focus

specifically on the technologies that are already adopted by certain countries.

INTRODUCTION 

This report describes different contact tracing technologies currently deployed and

how they can help in containing the spread of COVID-19. The target audience is the

general public that is concerned with the potential cyber risks posed by the use of

those technologies. 

Along with physical distancing and washing hands regularly, technology can help

automate the manual work of contact tracing and slow down the spread of the virus.

It can bridge the gap until the entire population reaches the so-called herd immunity

or vaccines and treatments are available. End of April 2020, the infection rate among

Geneva, CH inhabitants was

10% while it would require 65% to reach herd immunity.

Experts say effective vaccine and antiviral treatments will be available only at the

end 2020 / beginning of 2021. 

With 92% of all adults in Switzerland owning a smartphone [

,
Deloitte

Statista

], digital

contact tracing is seen as a complement to other measures to release the pressure on

health services while restoring freedom of movement and restarting the economy. 

How Manual Contact Tracing Works 

Manual contact tracing allows tracing back a potential chain of infections and giving

early warnings to potentially infected people. This starts with Bob being diagnosed

with COVID-19. He is then interviewed by a health inspector asking all his

whereabouts and encounters from recollection of the last 14 days. The inspector then

assesses all the potential contacts at risk who are then contacted to stay in quarantine

and potentially take a test. 

How Can Technology Help Automate Contact Tracing 

Manual contact tracing is a fastidious and slow process. This results in the virus

always being one step ahead of the health inspectors. In order to contain the spread

of the virus, a fast reaction time is key. Technology can help by providing immediate

notifications to potentially infected persons by automating the contact tracing

process, especially between commuters using public transports, or neighbours at a

restaurant who would have no way to contact each other otherwise. 

A study by Oxford epidemiologists published in Science concludes that with 80%

application adoption (~57% of the entire population in the UK) and a clear test and

quarantine policy, the virus can be fully contained. The ideal course of action is to

notify contacts of a potentially infected person to self-quarantine as soon as that

person has symptoms confirmed by health authorities. Those same contacts should be

notified again as soon as the person has been tested positive or negative to

recommend staying quarantined or be released, respectively. This strategy can

contain the spread of the virus while minimizing quarantine time and scope given a

What Are The Risks of Digital Contact Tracing 

Regardless of the technology being used for automating contact tracing, they all create

new risks: 

● Privacy Risks - from disclosing the identities of users infected by COVID-19

and their whereabouts, to revealing the real-world social network of an

individual or part of the population. 

● Cybersecurity Risks - mostly abusing the system to target specific individuals

or companies with false notifications leading to unnecessary quarantine. 

In this report, we review the different technologies which can be used for automating

contact tracing. We assess their pros and cons and focus on the privacy and security

risks they pose to individuals, companies and states. We conclude this report with our

assessment of the existing solutions put in place, and we provide some guidelines to

further mitigate the risks. All references are directly embedded as links in this report

(see underlined text).

TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW 

Different technologies can be used for automating contact tracing. In order to work,

contact tracing needs to know that two persons were close-by for a certain amount of

time. To infer people were close-by, one can use the smartphone's absolute location or

relative location (proximity) to other smartphones. With absolute location, two

smartphones are in contact if their geographic coordinates are within a predefined

distance (e.g. 5m). With proximity technologies such as Bluetooth and WiFi, two

smartphones will consider to be in contact when they can hear the signal of the other.

Below we present in more detail the different technologies: 

1. Mobile Operator Contact Tracing -

The location of a mobile phone can be

determined on the mobile operator side using the mobile operator’s

infrastructure.

Multilateration of radio signals between cell towers can locate a

phone with an accuracy of +/-140m in urban areas and up to kilometers in

rural areas. The main advantage of the technology is that it is non-intrusive

and can be put in place without any user intervention assuming a legal

framework is in place. When applied to contact tracing, the main drawback is

the poor accuracy and the serious privacy concerns that entail mapping a

diagnosed individual’s location trail with all the other individuals’ trail who

have crossed paths. 

2. Location-based Contact Tracing -

Smartphones can locate themselves using

their on-device capabilities. Those include GPS for precise location, which

however mostly works outdoors (+/-2m). For indoors where most encounters

happen, device-side cell

tower multilateration and crowd-sourced WiFi

localisation (+/-10m) can be used. With newer WiFi access-points, indoor WiFi

multilateration brings the

accuracy down to 1-2 meters

. Those capabilities

combined have

the main advantage of being more accurate than

multilateration performed by the mobile operators alone but have the main

drawback of requiring users to install a dedicated application on their phone. 

3. Proximity-based Contact Tracing -

While location-based contact tracing

requires an absolute geographical location, technologies such as Bluetooth and

WiFi allow inferring the relative proximity of smartphones by transmitting a

small-range signal that others can hear and record (up to 50m outdoors and

25m indoors for Bluetooth). Those technologies have the main advantage of

not having to disclose one’s absolute location and offer a finer estimation of

distance, especially indoors. It shares the similar drawback of location-based

contact tracing requiring users to install an application. 

Other approaches such as mobile or credit-card payments can be used to trace back

contacts based on linking purchases from different customers around the same time

in the same venue. This approach, used in South Korea, is not covered here.

PRIVACY AND CYBERSECURITY RISKS 

Adoption is key for the success of tracing applications and large adoption will be

possible only if there is public trust in the developed application. In order to build this

trust, privacy and security will have to be guaranteed, or at least maximized. There

exist several different architecture models,

location-based or Bluetooth-based,

centralised or decentralised, and none of them can guarantee zero re-identification

risk and full privacy for every user, especially those that become infected. However,

this being said, different approaches will have diverse effects on privacy and security,

and our goal here is to clarify the potential risks that each approach will create

towards privacy and security.  

In general, basic data protection principles such as

data minimization (sharing the

minimal amount necessary for the service’s purpose),

purpose

storage limitation

or
​

(limit the use of data to the service’s clearly defined purpose and limit its storage in

time to the period the service is provided) should be guaranteed by the contact

tracing application (

GDPR

). This means that the system should not learn more

information about

individuals

than what

it needs to fulfill

the functional

requirements of contact tracing (CT).  

Threat Model 

For each of the following risks, it is also important to specify for each approach who is

the potential

attacker (who could jeopardize privacy) and who is the potential

victim

(whose privacy might be at risk). 

In terms of attackers, there are essentially two main actors that we consider in our

analysis. First, the central server, that can have access to more or less information

depending on the CT approach. This central server may be run by the health

authority. Second, any malicious third party, without any specific privilege, could try

to gain information, e.g., by eavesdropping the CT-related communications, or to

generate false alarms. Other potential attackers include the operating system, the

network provider, the app developer, or the cloud provider, if any. 

Among potential victims, we can identify three main categories: (i) the infected users,

more precisely those who have been diagnosed positive and report that they have

been diagnosed positive, (ii) the users who have been in contact with one or more

infected users (exposed users), and (iii) any other users of the CT system. 

Privacy Risks 

The risks on individual privacy can be categorised as follows: 

1. Health Status Privacy - In general, independently of the type of contact

tracing system, the first risk is to leak the identities of

users infected by

COVID-19

. This information is by definition highly sensitive and is protected

by medical secrecy. Therefore, it should remain accessible only to the infected

users and the health authority. A related privacy risk is to learn the identities

of users who have been in contact with an infected user (exposed users). 

2. Location Privacy - Another privacy risk is to learn a user’s mobility traces.

Locations visited by a user can reveal a lot about her, from her political and

religious views to her social relationships [

,
NYT

,
NSA

walk2friends

]. No system

should

a priori need access to location data to perform contact tracing.

Geolocation-based contact tracing systems do however require location to infer

proximity. Moreover, Bluetooth-based approaches could also indirectly reveal

location data due to co-location information [

Olteanu2017

] and local Bluetooth

sniffing stations [

corona-sniffer

]. 

3. Social Graph Privacy - Learning a user’s social graph represents the third

main privacy concern. This can be learned either directly through proximity

data between users (for Bluetooth-based systems) or by relying on location

data (for location-based systems) [

,
NSA

walk2friends

]. The system does not

need to know the global social graph to perform contact tracing, but only the

contacts between infected users and other users (proximity/local graph).

Knowing the social graphs of a significant number of users can be further used

to de-anonymize these users. For instance, if an attacker has access to side

channel information, such as online social networks, he can match it to the

global social graph he has reconstructed with contact tracing and then

re-identify the users in this graph [

deanon

]. 

Cybersecurity Risks 

The cybersecurity risks are: 

1. False Alarms - A user can create false alarms (e.g., through active relays and

replay attacks). This could for example lead to the quarantine of employees of

the defense, the government, or critical infrastructure.  

2. Passive Disruption -

A user can prevent notifications that other users are

exposed, e.g., by (temporarily) disabling the Bluetooth or GPS functionality. Or

simply by not reporting after diagnosis. This would reduce the traceability of

the coronavirus and the ability to isolate infected users. This risk is inherent to

any voluntary-based contact tracing system. 

3. Active Disruption -

An attacker can prevent contact discovery (e.g., by

jamming the Bluetooth channel). This would reduce the traceability of the

coronavirus and the ability to isolate infected users. This risk is inherent to any

Bluetooth-based contact tracing system.

NHSx in the UK decided to investigate both Bluetooth approaches (legacy and

the Isle of Wight, the

government announced on June 18th they will release an app

using the Apple-Google approach (

more details to the story

) but 

not before winter

. 

Given the technical limitations of legacy Bluetooth, Apple and Google have partnered

to provide a dedicated solution known as

,
Apple-Google Exposure Notification API

which is more battery efficient and has no background limitations. More and more

countries are adopting this

de facto standard (

Spain

, Austria). This will provide a

compatible solution between a few of Switzerland’s neighbors (Italy, Germany,

Austria) and an incompatible solution with France. 

For a more detailed evaluation of the worldwide adoption, see

MOBILE OPERATOR CONTACT TRACING 

Cell-phone location data is being used in Israel by the

Shin Bet in collaboration with

the Health department

. It is the first government using such data for public health

purposes. It required passing an emergency law on March 16th, 2020 to track people

infected with COVID-19 including to identify and quarantine others they have come

into contact with. “

Once an individual is highlighted as a possible coronavirus case, the

health ministry will then be able to track whether or not they are adhering to

quarantine rules. It can also send a text message to people who may have come into

contact with them before symptoms emerged
”,
​
possessing a cell phone are tracked through this system.  

according to the BBC

. All Israelis

In Switzerland, such location data from

Swisscom’s Mobility Insights is

used by the

FOPH to “

see what impact the federal government measures have had on people

” Such location data at
heading to parks, popular tourist spots and other public spaces.
​

a resolution of 100m x 100m -- aggregated and anonymized -- are already used to

provide insights for urban or transport planning.

The low accuracy of mobile location tracking (+/-140m) makes it unfit for tracing

contacts between specific individuals. That said,

for the post-lockdown,

this

technology could be used in two ways: 

1. Impact of lockdown measures -

Assess the average density of people over

time at public places like train stations or parks to assess lockdown measures

are well respected. 

2. Environmental contamination -

Pinpoint potentially contaminated venues by

looking for common places visited by infected individuals. This would

3

however require deanonymizing users’ identity, which is not permitted by law

in CH. If permitted, it could allow contacting the visitors of such venues. As an

alternative, it could signal that a particular venue requires to be disinfected. 

Privacy/cybersecurity risks -

The approach of Israel is certainly the worst in terms

of privacy risks. Indeed, the central server (be it the Shin Bet or the health ministry)

can track all movements of all mobile users. This means it can then also know the

infection status of mobile users, track their locations, and reconstruct their social

graphs. Moreover, it is not on a voluntary basis, but mandatory by law. On the

contrary, Swisscom’s Mobility Insights provides only aggregated statistics to the FOPH

(Federal Office of Public Health), which significantly reduces the risks of individual

location tracking. The location data resolution was of 100m x 100m and the released

statistics contained at least 20 individual records in order to prevent re-identification

attacks. Cybersecurity risks are clearly minimized with the mobile operator contact

tracing approach since it controls the entire system. 

Main Pros 

● Non-intrusive - users do not need to opt-in or install any application.  

● High adoption - with a single mobile operator in most countries. 

● Government oversight of notifications to exposed individuals. 

● Cybersecurity risks are minimal. 

● Privacy risks of Mobility Insights are limited thanks to statistics aggregation. 

Main Cons 

● Limited accuracy makes it unfit for contact tracing between individuals. 

● Critical mass - Swisscom with its

market share covers 60% of the population

and has a critical mass for data to be exploitable. In other countries with no

dominant operator, cooperation between operators would be required. 

● The Shin Bet approach is the most privacy invasive among all contact tracing

technologies in modern democratic countries.

LOCATION-BASED CONTACT TRACING 

A few countries such as

Iceland and

India decided to use location-based applications.

We review here

SafePath from MIT, which strives to offer a privacy-preserving

solution for such applications. We are not aware of any country using this approach

already. 

SafePath uses the smartphone location capabilities in a way that attempts to preserve

privacy, as described in Figure 2 below. It enables individuals to log their own

location called “trails” on their device. Once diagnosed positive, individuals can

provide health officials with accurate location trails (1). The health authorities

receiving those trails are equipped with a tool to remove sensitive location trails for

diagnosed carriers and local businesses (2). This sanitized location trail is then

broadcast to all other SafePath users (3), who can compare it with their own trails and

determine whether they have crossed paths with the diagnosed carrier (4).

Privacy/cybersecurity risks -

SafePath’s approach is one step ahead in terms of

privacy compared to other GPS-based solutions or the one developed by the Shin Bet.

Safe Path’s ability to do the matching on the device, that is, without collecting the

trails from all users, prevents massive government surveillance. However, its first

two versions still allow the central server/health authority to have access to the

location trails of all infected users, including sensitive location data. This will also

reveal co-location between infected users, and thus part of the social graph. The

central server can also learn who has been infected. An upcoming version of SafePath

should also encrypt the sanitized location traces before sending and comparing them

(encrypted). This is a promising direction but it still lacks details to be fully evaluated. 

There are also high cybersecurity risks due to GPS spoofing attacks (which can simply

be performed with an

application

, or with more advanced techniques to take over the

GPS signal seamlessly [

Tippenhauer11

]). In such an attack, a malicious user can send

a fake GPS signal and make other users think she was close to them. This could be

used to generate numerous false alarms, e.g.,

towards targeted employees or

governmental officials. 

Main Pros 

● Privacy-first approach with decentralised processing of trail matching. 

● Enables to assess environmental contamination.  

Main Cons 

● Low precision, especially indoors, which might lead to both high false positives

and false negatives. 

● The ability to fake the GPS location of the users opens the door to serious

cybersecurity risks (false alarms). 

● Even though privacy risks are reduced with SafePath compared to other

mobile operator or location-based approaches, in its first versions location

traces are leaked to the central server, which raises serious privacy concerns. 

● Users have to trust the health authority to implement the privacy mechanism.

PROXIMITY-BASED CONTACT TRACING 

In both centralised (

ROBERT

, FR) and decentralised (

DP-3T and Apple-Google

Exposure Notification, CH) approaches, users regularly exchange ephemeral

identifiers with other users nearby. In order to exchange their identifiers, both users

need to have the contact tracing application installed and their Bluetooth activated.

Those identifiers are depicted with fruits in Figure 3 below at steps (1) and (2). The

ephemeral identifiers are regularly updated (e.g., every 15 minutes). The application

sends to and receives identifiers from other nearby users. It also stores two lists: (i)

one for the sent identifiers, and (ii) one for the received identifiers (see tables in the

figures below). These lists are regularly updated by removing old identifiers that are

not useful

for

tracing the coronavirus

infection anymore (typically those

sent/received more than two weeks ago). The centralised and decentralised

approaches mainly differ in how they generate the identifiers and how they identify

exposed users.  

 - Centralised Proximity-based Contact Tracing such as ROBERT. 
Figure 3
​

In centralised systems -- such as ROBERT -- the ephemeral identifiers are generated by

the server and then sent to the app. Moreover, they are linked to a long-term

pseudonym. Upon positive diagnosis, in centralised systems the infected user sends

the list of

received identifiers to the server (3). The app of other users queries the

server to know whether the user has been in contact with an infected user (4 & 5).

Indeed, the server stores the list of users the infected user has encountered and can

map it to a long-term pseudonym. Therefore, the server can easily check whether any

user has been exposed and notify the app accordingly (6).  

 - Decentralised Proximity-based Contact Tracing such as DP-3T and 
Figure 4
​

Apple-Google’s Exposure Notification. 

In decentralised systems -- such as DP-3T and Apple-Google Exposure Notification --

the ephemeral identifiers are directly generated by the app of the user (or the OS).

When diagnosed positive, the app sends the list of

sent

identifiers to the server (3). In
​

practice, a condensed form of those identifiers known as the diagnosis key is sent to

the server. In order to determine whether a user has been in contact with infected

users (i.e., exposed), Bob app downloads the list (of sent identifiers) of infected users

(4) and checks

locally if one of the received identifiers (stored by the app) is part of

the downloaded list (5). 

Centralised vs. Decentralised - Besides the differences on privacy, the centralised

approaches have the following main advantages compared to the decentralised

approaches: 

● Pandemic Oversight - By centralising data, the centralised approach gives the

health authorities a better overview of the current spread of the virus in

real-time (i.e. number of persons potentially at risk). It eases identifying

clusters if many people report having seen the same identifiers ((4) in Fig. 4). It

also provides more data to epidemiologists to model epidemics and fine-tune

the computation of the risk factor (indicating the risk of each individual). This

risk factor will be determined by parameters that can be fine-tuned based on

data analysis, and help minimize false positives (i.e. help receiving too many

false alarms/notifications) and false negatives (i.e. not receiving a notification

when one should have). Note that the above is also possible with the

decentralised approaches, but it is assumed that users will have to give their

consent by opt-in to share their data with health authorities and

epidemiologists. 

● Faster Notifications - In the centralised approaches, the health authorities

will be in charge of the servers and have therefore more control on

notifications

sent

to persons deemed at risk. With the Apple-Google

decentralised solution, diagnosis keys will be broadcast to all users

every 24h

only

. This in order to gather enough diagnosis keys and prevent

the

re-identification of diagnosed individuals. This also means that the on-device

matching to know whether one has been exposed will be delayed

consequently. According to the Oxford study [

Fraser

], each single hour counts

and delays in notifying contacts could jeopardize the containment of the virus. 

Privacy/cybersecurity risks -

We summarize here the findings of the detailed risk

analysis carried out in the next section. Centralised systems tend to put at risk the

privacy of

, especially against the central server, while decentralised systems
all users
​

tend to put at risk the privacy of

infected people against anyone (e.g., another user).

Centralised systems put more location privacy and social graph privacy at risk than

decentralised systems. However, decentralised systems tend to be more vulnerable to

the re-identification of infected users. Besides that, the centralised approach provides

a single point of failure that a successful hacker could leverage to gain access to all the

information stored by the central server. It further gives the ability for authoritarian

regimes (or any state with subpoenas)

to look for a specific person (under

investigation) and get access to all her data. 

In terms of cybersecurity risks, proximity-based contract tracing is also prone to false

alarm attacks, although these are more challenging to carry out

than with

location-based contact tracing. The decentralised approach would be particularly

prone to this attack as no control is envisioned as opposed to a centralised approach

where the health authority has oversight of notifications and can detect “mass

notifications”. To counteract such attacks, one would need to send blacklists of

ephemeral IDs that should not be accounted for the calculation of the risk factor.

approaches, especially indoor (see this

● Bluetooth works indoors and even offline. 

● Privacy is better preserved relatively to other (mobile operator or

location-based) approaches, especially in the decentralised scheme. 

Main Cons 

● Contact data gives no context about the environment (indoor vs. outdoor,

public vs. private places), which epidemiologists could use to better

understand how the virus spreads. 

● The propagation of electromagnetic waves correlates poorly with that of

droplets (for instance, it can cross walls), and it is hard to map noisy signal

strength measurements to distances beyond 2m. 

● Compared to mobile phone operator tracing, it needs the mobile phone user to

install an app. Compared to location-based contact tracing,

it needs the

continuous activation of Bluetooth which exposes the users to the risks of

being tracked by third parties with a Bluetooth sniffer. 

● Although more challenging, cybersecurity attacks such as false alarms are still

feasible.

DETAILED RISK ANALYSIS OF PROXIMITY-BASED CONTACT TRACING 

We review below in more details the privacy and cybersecurity risks of the two main

Bluetooth-based contact

tracing solutions, namely EN/DP-3T (decentralised) and

ROBERT (centralised) since those are the two main systems being used worldwide.

We do not cover the risks of recent proposals [

,
Epione

Desire

] since those solutions

are mid-term to long-term solutions that cannot be readily available to the public. 

Risks on Health Status Privacy 

EN/DP-3T - An attacker can identify the infected users he has been physically near to.

He can do so by creating multiple accounts in the contact tracing systems and by

using them for a short period of time. He can also do so by frequently rotating his

own Bluetooth broadcast identifier to be able to later retrieve which infected user he

has encountered, provided that he has not been in contact with multiple infected

users during this timeframe. The attacker can match the set of infected identifiers

against each of her recorded Bluetooth identifiers to determine when he was in

contact with an infected person and use this information to reveal the identity of the

infected user. Even though the ephemeral identifiers are set to be updated, e.g., every

15 minutes, this could be modified by the attacker to be updated more frequently

DP-3T analysis
[

]. 

ROBERT - It is more difficult for an attacker (other than the central server) to identify

infected users since the central server can make the registration of multiple dummy

accounts more difficult. For instance, ROBERT currently requires a CAPTCHA to

register an account, even though it is probably not sufficient to avoid sybil attacks at a

large scale. However, with a centralised approach, the central server learns who is

infected, but this will also certainly happen if the server is also the health authority.

Moreover, the server can learn the identities of users observed by the infected user

(i.e., exposed users). This is due to the fact that the server can associate ephemeral

Bluetooth IDs to long-term identifiers. Besides the server itself, there is always the

risk of unauthorized access to this data by third parties (e.g., hackers).  

Note that in general there is always the risk, in both approaches, that the central

server learns which users are infected by looking at their network identifiers (e.g., IP

address). This could be mitigated by relying on a proxy, e.g., a local hospital which

must be itself trusted, a VPN, or an anonymity network like Tor.  

Risks on Location Privacy 

Despite the fact that proximity-based approaches do not collect location data, they are

also prone to location privacy breaches under some conditions, as described below.  

-
EN/DP-3T

there is a risk of location tracking by a malicious third party installing

enough Bluetooth sniffers at different physical locations and a mobile device hacked

(i.e. rooted or jailbroken) [

]. Here only infected users would be at risk

of being tracked. It is very difficult to prevent such an attack against a global

eavesdropper. See below for more details about the attack. 

ROBERT - there is a risk of location tracking (by the central server) with the

centralised approach if the central server has access to an auxiliary channel such as

CCTV footage or local eavesdropping stations (sniffers) that enables it to associate a

location to a pseudonymous long-term identifier. This attack would affect any user,

i.e., both infected and non-infected users. 

Example: Location Disclosure of Infected Users with Exposure Notification 

The location of diagnosed individuals using the DP-3T or Apple-Google EN solution

can be disclosed by collecting their transmitted Bluetooth signal. This attack detailed

by

Otto Seiskari works as follows. Bluetooth sniffers, potentially smartphones with a

dedicated app, listen to the DP-3T or Apple-Google Exposure Notification transmitted

by individuals. Those smartphones also record the location where those IDs were

heard. This data can then be sent to a central database. Whenever someone is

diagnosed positive and her key is broadcast to all users of the contact tracing

application, a hacker can intercept this diagnosis key. From this key, one can derive

the ephemeral IDs that were generated and query the database for the location where

those IDs were seen. As shown by this simulation below, given enough sniffers, one

could uncover the whereabouts of diagnosed individuals.

voluntarily uploaded their positive infection status to the local health authorities.

Blue circles are signals recorded from other people using the contact tracing service.

As illustrated by the lines connecting the red dots, the route traveled by each infected

individual can be reconstructed within the range of the sniffer grid. 

Even though the transmission of the diagnosis key will be secured and stored securely

on the hardware keystore of iPhones and Android (

Secure Enclave and Trust Platform

Module on iPhones and Android, respectively), most Android phones sold before 2018

do not have this secure keystore. It only requires rooting one “unsecure” Android

phone and extracting the key from memory to potentially uncover the locations

visited by diagnosed individuals through this attack. 

Risks on Social Graph Privacy 

EN/DP-3T

: In the decentralised approach, the central server will only learn colocation

information between infected users, and nothing more. This will dramatically reduce

the coverage of the social graph, and certainly prevent further attacks based on it.

This should represent limited information as long as only a very limited percentage of

users get infected. Finally, a recent attack also showed that someone could formally

prove that he encountered a person who was diagnosed as infected. This attack also

affects health status privacy by making infected users easier to identify. 

ROBERT:

This is probably the most serious privacy risk with the centralised

Bluetooth-based approach. The central server learns all the interactions of infected

users which can quickly percolate to a significant portion of the social graph of all

users (due to the structure of social graphs and small-world phenomenon). It also

raises interdependent privacy risks, since it can indirectly expose the social graph of

other, non-infected, users. It is well-known that once we have a significant portion of

a social graph, it is possible to de-anonymize the graph with auxiliary information

such as online social networks [

deanon

].  

Summary of Privacy Risks and Potential Improvements 

In summary, centralised systems tend to put at risk the privacy of

, especially
all users
​

against a malicious central server, while decentralised systems tend to put at risk the

privacy of

infected people against anyone, as also observed by [

Vaudenay

]. Moreover,

centralised systems put more location privacy and social graph privacy at risk than

decentralised systems. However, decentralised systems tend to be more vulnerable to

re-identifying infected users. Besides that, the centralised approach provides a single

point of failure that a successful hacker could leverage to gain access to all the

information stored by the central server. It further gives the ability for authoritarian

regimes (or any state with subpoenas)

to look for a specific person (under

investigation) and get access to all her data.  

Note that privacy can be further enhanced using private set intersection, private

], and prevent some of the above risks, such as learning the users’ social graph

or learning who has been diagnosed positive. For instance, by using two-party private

set intersection-cardinality (PSI-CA), neither the central server nor other users can

infer the infection status of the users [

Epione]

.   

Cybersecurity Risks 

Given that active and passive disruption is inherent to Bluetooth-based voluntary

contact tracing and relatively simple to understand, we focus in the following on the

risks of false alarms with a malicious intent (not because of the contact tracing

technology). 

The most threatening cybersecurity attack is the one that generates false alarms

(either to targeted people or to large numbers of users) for various malicious

purposes. One key threat

is to send false alarms to employees of critical

infrastructures (power plants, military bases, etc.). A typical scenario is one where the

attacker can recruit someone with symptoms and get his phone. The attacker with the

borrowed phone can then get in close contact with the targeted employees (e.g., in

bars at night for soldiers). When the person with symptoms gets positively tested at

the hospital, it will raise an alarm to all exposed employees and recommend them to

stay in quarantine (until they get tested themselves). A more technically sophisticated

approach is to relay Bluetooth signals of users that are or might be diagnosed soon

(e.g., by staying close to a testing center). Fig. 6 below illustrates such an attack

carried out by Dave and Bob. Bob stays close-by to Alice who is currently at a test

center to get diagnosed. She will soon be diagnosed positive. Bob listens to the IDs that

Alice is sending (1). He relays those over the Internet to Dave (2 and 3). Dave is close

to his target and replays sending those IDs as if they were sent by Alice. When Alice is

confirmed positive and the target receives Alice’s diagnosis key from the health

authority, it will receive a notification saying he has been exposed. 

Such attacks can also be carried remotely, potentially even as far as from a satellite

belonging to a rogue state that would relay those signals of infected or soon to be

diagnosed individuals [

,
4G over satellite

]
SMS from Satellite

(4 and 5). The

decentralised approach would be particularly prone to this attack as opposed to a

centralised approach where the health authority has oversight of notifications and

can detect such attacks when done

en masse (i.e. “mass notifications”). To counteract

such attacks, one would need to send blacklists of ephemeral IDs that should not be

accounted for the on-device calculation of the risk factor.

CONCLUSION 

The hype around digital contact tracing started with scientific studies demonstrating

that Bluetooth-based solutions could prevent a second wave if enough users

participate. But, in practice, there are too many unknowns. 

In terms of effectiveness, it is still not proven that Bluetooth can provide an accurate

estimation of distance and not result in too many false alarms [

Dehaye

]. Also, given

that most countries will rely on Apple-Google's solution, which does not provide the

raw data to estimate such distance, it is questionable how the Apple-Google solution

can be improved to reduce the false positives and false negatives as epidemiologists

will have little data to work on. 

The current version of the decentralised approaches adopted by many countries (incl.

Switzerland) puts the privacy of infected individuals at risk. Centralized approaches

such as those adopted by France with ROBERT tend to put at risk the privacy of

all

, especially against a malicious central authority or a hacker targeting this
users
​

authority. In terms of cybersecurity, all app-based solutions, whether location-based

or proximity-based, are prone to targeted attacks. A location-based app can be

tricked with GPS spoofing where an attacker can fake her location and target a

location from anywhere on earth and pretend it was close to its victim. Although

more difficult, Bluetooth-based approaches are also prone to such attacks where an

attacker can relay “infected” IDs to a target by being close-by, but also remotely with

satellite communication. 

Given the privacy and cybersecurity risks and an effectiveness that is still to be

proven, we conclude that there isn’t any technological solution yet that can fulfill

effectiveness while providing privacy guarantees and being cyber-attack free. 

Shall a contact

tracing

solution be launched, we provide the following

recommendations to mitigate targeted cyber-attacks and also how to react in case of

attack or suspicion of attack: 

1. Digital contact tracing is mainly of value to trace back strangers in public 

transport and spaces or, e.g., neighbours at a restaurant where we would have 

no way to contact otherwise. It is questionable why this should be an 

“always-on” technology. We recommend disabling Bluetooth in private spaces 

where manual contact tracing is in place. 

2. Consider any smartphone left unattended as suspicious (or any other small

battery-powered computation device such as a Raspberry Pi). 

3. Many alarms received by a subset of related people concomitantly might be a

sign of an attack. 

It is important to also note that any legal recourse against attackers will be made

difficult as the identity of an infected accomplices sharing its infecting Bluetooth

For the future and the next pandemics, many improvements can be made to render

digital contact tracing effective. Regarding accuracy, 5G combined to other on-device

location capabilities will provide a higher precision (although only in urban areas).

For privacy, many solutions have already been proposed to provide higher

guarantees using for example secure multi-party computation (such as private set

intersection). But those, while providing stronger privacy guarantees, do not address

all cybersecurity risks.
