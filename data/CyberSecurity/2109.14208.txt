Abstract‚Äî Vehicle-to-vehicle

communication enables au-
tonomous platoons to boost trafÔ¨Åc efÔ¨Åciency and safety, while
ensuring string stability with a constant spacing policy. How-
ever, communication-based controllers are susceptible to a
range of cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a distributed
attack mitigation defense framework with a dual-mode control
system reconÔ¨Åguration scheme to prevent a compromised pla-
toon member from causing collisions via message falsiÔ¨Åcation
attacks. In particular, we model
it as a switched system
consisting of a communication-based cooperative controller
and a sensor-based local controller and derive conditions to
achieve global uniform exponential stability (GUES) as well as
string stability in the sense of platoon operation. The switching
decision comes from game-theoretic analysis of the attacker and
the defender‚Äôs interactions. In this framework, the attacker acts
as a leader that chooses whether to engage in malicious activities
and the defender decides which control system to deploy with
the help of an anomaly detector. Imperfect detection reports
associate the game with imperfect information. A dedicated
state constraint further enhances safety against bounded but
aggressive message modiÔ¨Åcations in which a bounded solu-
tion may still violate practical constraint e.g. vehicles nearly
crashing. Our formulation uniquely combines switched systems
with security games to strategically improve the safety of such
autonomous vehicle systems.

I. INTRODUCTION

Connected and autonomous vehicles have emerged as an
extensive and promising research area over the past two
decades [1]. As a closely related topic, vehicular platooning
earns its reputation by providing driving/passenger comfort,
improved energy efÔ¨Åciency, pollution reduction as well as in-
crease of trafÔ¨Åc throughput. The platooning concept involves
a group of vehicles travelling in a tightly coupled manner
from an origin to a destination as a single unit. A platoon
member receives other vehicles‚Äô dynamics and maneuver-
related information via a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) commu-
nication network to compute control commands accordingly
and maintain platoon stability, i.e. to maintain a narrow inter-
vehicle distance and relative velocity.

However, such V2V communication implementations also
expose novel attack vectors, which increase security vulner-
abilities and highlight vehicle platoons as an appealing target
for cyber-physical attacks. Adversaries could inject multiple
falsiÔ¨Åed vehicle nodes into the platoon remotely, which
allows them to publish carefully crafted beacon messages to
gain the privilege of the road or to cause trafÔ¨Åc congestion

and even serious collisions [2]. There is urgent need to
address the safety risks caused by such communication-
based attacks. This paper focuses on a longitudinal control
system for vehicular platooning, characterised by two upper
controllers, which provide individual vehicle stability and/or
string stability. We propose a novel dual-mode control system
reconÔ¨Åguration scheme that involves a switching process
between the two controllers. To ensure stable switching, we
Ô¨Årstly provide conditions on controller gains that is sufÔ¨Åcient
to guarantee global uniform exponential stability (GUES).
Secondly, a minimum dwell time constraint for the string
stable controller is then provided, which means this controller
is required to be activated at least for this amount of the
time to mitigate the defects brought by the other controller
in terms of string stability. Thirdly, a security game with
imperfect information is then constructed and solved to guide
the switching process based on Nash equilibrium solutions,
which creates a hybrid combination of game theory and
control theory. This game models intelligent and stealthy
attacks from rational adversaries, who attempts to bypass
detection using the knowledge about the system. It takes
the limitations of existing anomaly detection approaches into
account while modeling the interactions between attacker
and defender. Fourthly, a dedicated switching surface is
also introduced to capture practical constraints. Lastly, the
effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown with some
numerical and simulation examples. The contributions of this
paper include:

‚Ä¢ We present a dual-mode control system reconÔ¨Åguration
scheme to mitigate communication-based attacks. along
with a sufÔ¨Åcient condition in terms of controller gains
to ensure stability of the switched system.

‚Ä¢ We provide a lower bound on the dwell time of the
string-stable controller to ensure string stability of the
switched system after an attack is mitigated.

‚Ä¢ We develop a unique approach that uses game theory
to guide a switched system for communication-based
attack mitigation purposes. Our security game formula-
tion captures imperfect detectors as a chance node in
our security game structure, and takes detection errors
(e.g., false alarms and misses) into account.

‚Ä¢ The results are illustrated using sophisticated, system-

level simulations.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section II
formulates the considered platoon framework. Section III
presents the attack model. The proposed control system
reconÔ¨Åguration scheme is discussed in Section IV along with
the derived stability conditions. Game theoretic analysis is

 
 
 
 
 
 
performed in Section V. Section VI outlines some concluding
remarks and future work.

A. Literature Review

Sumra et al. [3] provide a comprehensive survey of the
attacks on major security goals, i.e., conÔ¨Ådentiality, integrity
and availability. Malicious attackers can breach privacy by
attempting an eavesdropping attack to steal and misuse
conÔ¨Ådential information [4]. The use of vehicular botnets
to attempt a denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-
service (DDoS) attack may cause serious network congestion
or disruption [5], [6]. The attacker may disrupt the platoon
operation by hijacking the sensors to conduct the replay
attack with the aim to feed the control system with outdated
signals generated previously by the system [7].

II. BACKGROUND

A. Autonomous Vehicle Platoon Model

to

have

Several

attempts

been made

detect
communication-based attacks. A sliding mode observer is
proposed for cyber-attack detection and estimation in the
case of event-triggered communication [8]. There is also a
growing body of literature that recognises the effectiveness
of machine learning based intrusion detection system applied
on vehicular platooning [9]‚Äì[12]. Even though such studies
aim to maximise their detection performance,
inevitable
false alarm and miss rates are problematic for real-world
applications. Moreover, attack mitigation still remains as
an open and active research area. An intelligent adversaries
may also use their knowledge about system vulnerabilities
to perform stealthy attacks that maximise their effect and
minimise detection rate.

There has been an increasing interest in cybersecurity
analysis from a game-theoretic viewpoint [13]. Extensive
research has been carried out to examine problems of allo-
cating limited defense resources (e.g. energy [14], manpower
[15], communication bandwidth [16]) against adversaries
in a network. In addition, several studies [17]‚Äì[20] have
also applied game theory for the design of control systems.
For instance, authors in [18] model the interaction of the
driver and the powertrain of an electric vehicle as a non-
coorperative game and construct a controller based on a feed-
back Stackelberg equilibrium. Game theory is also applied to
coordinate autonomous vehicles at an uncontrolled intersec-
tion to minimize the total delay [17]. The switched system
concept provides a systems-oriented alternative pathway to
mitigate attack effects and enhance safety in such adversarial
environments. A speciÔ¨Åc class of switched systems is deÔ¨Åned
as a family of linear time-invariant systems whose parameters
vary within a single Ô¨Ånite set according to a switching
signal or switching surface. There is large body of literature
on observer design for switched systems with unknown
inputs [21]‚Äì[23] and attempts to stabilise the system under
such situations [24]‚Äì[26]. The present work builds on these
existing literature and introduces a novel dual-mode control
system reconÔ¨Åguration scheme deÔ¨Åned as a switched system
consisting of a communication-based cooperative controller
and a sensor-based local controller. This article presents a
novel and systematic approach into game-theory-powered
switching system as a local online defense strategy.

We consider a hierarchical

longitudinal control struc-
ture [27], with an upper level controller and a lower lever
controller as shown in Fig. 1. The upper level controller
uses information on other vehicles acquired via sensors or
communication and internal vehicle dynamics to compute the
desired acceleration ùëéùëëùëñùëü for each vehicle. The lower level
controller generates actuator inputs (e.g. throttle and/or brake
commands) to track the desired acceleration.

In more detail, consider a platoon with 2 ‚â§ ùëÅ < ‚àû vehicles.
The ùëñùë° ‚Ñé vehicle‚Äôs state is deÔ¨Åned as [ùë•ùëñ (ùë°), ùë£ùëñ (ùë°)]ùëá , where
ùë•ùëñ (ùë°) ‚àà R and ùë£ùëñ (ùë°) ‚àà R are the position and velocity of vehicle
ùëñ. For the present work, we focus on the upper level controller
in which each vehicle follows second-order dynamics

(cid:164)ùë•ùëñ (ùë°) = ùë£ùëñ (ùë°),
(cid:164)ùë£ùëñ (ùë°) = ùë¢ùëñ (ùë°),
where ùë¢ùëñ (ùë°) is the control input (acceleration) to the system.
To simplify the notation, time ùë° is omitted thereafter. The
control policies considered in our defense framework can
take either of the following two forms:

(1)

1) Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC)
The control input in CACC is given by

where the set Nùëñ contains vehicles that communicate
with vehicle ùëñ (i.e., vehicle ùëñ‚Äôs neighbors) and ùëé ùëó
is the
acceleration of vehicle ùëó. Here ùõºùëñ ùëó ‚àà R, ùõΩùëñ ùëó ‚àà R and ùõæùëñ ùëó ‚àà R

are controller gains. In this way,
the desired acceleration in order to coordinate its speed
with its neighbors and to maintain the relative position of
itself with its around a desired (or targeted) inter-vehicle
distance ùêøùëñ ùëó . We choose the desired distance ùêøùëñ ùëó = ùêøŒîùëñ, ùëó ,
where Œîùëñ, ùëó ‚àà N is the number of vehicles (hops) between
vehicle ùëñ and ùëó, and ùêø is constant and uniform for all
vehicles of the platoon. Note that other vehicles‚Äô dynamics
the position, speed and acceleration tuple
information,
(ùë• ùëó , ùë£ ùëó , ùëé ùëó ), is acquired via wireless communication through
a V2V communication network, which can be implemented
for example in the form of a 5G or vehicular ad-hoc network.

where the set ùëó ‚àà Nùëñ contains the neighbors of vehicle ùëñ that
are detectable by on-board range sensors. As above, ùõºùëñ ùëó ‚àà
R and ùõΩùëñ ùëó ‚àà R are control gains. ACC control policy uses
only the relative position and velocity as feedbacks in order
to generate the desired acceleration to maintain a preÔ¨Åxed
inter-vehicle distance ùêøùëñ ùëó and relative velocity. In comparison
to CACC, other vehicles‚Äô dynamics information is obtained
only by sensor measurements, which we assume in this paper
to be reliable unlike communication messages.

In general, the double-integrator feedback system (1) for

vehicle ùëñ can be represented as

(cid:164)ùëß = ùê¥ùëß + ùêµùëÖ,
(4)
where ùëß = [ùë•ùëñ (ùë°), ùë£ùëñ (ùë°)]ùëá is the state vector for vehicle ùëñ
(abusing notation for simplicity) and

ùëÖ = [[ùë• ùëó ‚àí ùêøùëñ ùëó ] [ùë£ ùëó ] [ùëé ùëó ]]ùëá , ‚àÄ ùëó ‚àà Nùëñ,

is an external input vector that consists of other vehicle
dynamics, where [¬∑] represent a row vector of appropriate

Assumptions. To simplify our analysis, we adopt a speciÔ¨Åc
CACC setup as in [28], which is based on the predecessor-
leader following information Ô¨Çow topology [29]. In partic-
ular, each vehicle receives communicated position, velocity
and acceleration information from only the platoon leader
and its immediate proceeding vehicle, which equivalently
means Nùëñ = {1, ùëñ ‚àí 1} in (2). We also assume each vehicle
in the platoon only equips a Radar sensor at the vehicle‚Äôs
front, which measures the position and velocity of its pre-
decessor (i.e., Nùëñ = {ùëñ ‚àí 1} in (3)). The platoon leader is also
assumed to be driven by a human driver who is not affected
by communication attacks or sensor noise. Communication
noise and sensor noise are ignored due to their low impact
on system safety compared to intentional attacks.

B. Basic Platoon Stability Analysis

In the platoon operation with constant spacing policy,
two fundamental speciÔ¨Åcations, namely individual vehicle
stability and string stability, must be satisÔ¨Åed to achieve long-
term stable operation.

DeÔ¨Ånition 1 (Individual Vehicle Stability [27]): Let‚Äôs de-
Ô¨Åne the spacing error for the ùëñùë° ‚Ñé vehicle to be ùúñùëñ = ùë•ùëñ ‚àí ùë•ùëñ‚àí1 +
ùêø. The system (4) is said to have individual vehicle stability
if the following condition holds:

(cid:165)ùë•ùëñ‚àí1 ‚Üí 0 ‚áí ùúñùëñ ‚Üí 0, ùëñ = 2, . . . , ùëÅ.
(7)
This deÔ¨Ånition essentially means a vehicle achieves
asymptotic stability if the preceding vehicle operates at a
constant velocity. Since (4) is a linear time-invariant (LTI)
system, this stability can be achieved according to Lemma 1.
Lemma 1: If conditions (8) hold for the CACC control
system, then the system achieves bounded-input-bounded-
output (BIBO) stability, and therefore individual vehicle
stability is guaranteed.

ùëò1 < 0,

(8a)

ùëò2 ‚â§ ‚àí2

‚àöÔ∏Å‚àíùëò1.
(8b)
Proof: The proof is standard BIBO argument. An LTI
continuous-time system with state representation (ùê¥, ùêµ, ùê∂) is
BIBO stable if and only if the eigenvalues of ùê¥ are in the
left-hand complex plane. In other words, ùê¥ is a Hurwitz
matrix [30].

Similarly, the following conditions on control gain must
hold to achieve individual vehicle stability for ACC control
policy

ùëò3 < 0,

ùëò4 ‚â§ ‚àí2

‚àöÔ∏Å‚àíùëò3.

(9a)

(9b)

Remark 1: Even if each system is analytically proven
to be stable, the bounded solution resulting from bounded
disturbances may violate practical constraints that lead to
collisions. More details will be discussed in later sections.
If the preceding vehicle is not operating at constant velocity
(i.e., accelerating or braking), the spacing error ùúñùëñ is expected
to be nonzero. Therefore it is important to make sure spacing
errors are guaranteed not to amplify as they propagate down
to the tail of the platoon.

DeÔ¨Ånition 2 (String Stability [27]): Let‚Äôs deÔ¨Åne the spac-
ing error for the ùëñùë° ‚Ñé vehicle to be ùúñùëñ = ùë•ùëñ ‚àíùë•ùëñ‚àí1 + ùêø. The system
(4) is said to have string stability if the following condition
holds:

(cid:107)ùúñùëñ (cid:107)‚àû ‚â§ (cid:107)ùúñùëñ‚àí1(cid:107)‚àû, ùëñ = 2, . . . , ùëÅ.
(10)
Theorem 1 ( [27]): Let the spacing errors of consecutive
. The

vehicles be related by the transfer function ÀÜùêª (ùë†) = ùúñùëñ
ùúñùëñ‚àí1
string stability condition (10) holds, if

(cid:107) ÀÜùêª (ùë†)(cid:107)‚àû ‚â§ 1,

ÀÜ‚Ñé(ùë°) > 0,

where ÀÜ‚Ñé(ùë°) is the impulse response of

ÀÜùêª (ùë†).

The string stability proofs for both systems are omitted due to
space limitation. In summary, the ACC controller can achieve
individual vehicle stability via proper controller tuning but
fails to ensure string stability under a constant spacing policy.
Whereas the CACC controller achieves both stabilities when
vehicle-to-vehicle communication is established.

III. ATTACK MODEL

We consider a particular type of communication attack,
namely a message falsiÔ¨Åcation attack as described in [1].
By continuously monitoring the communication network, the
adversary may change the content of received messages and
subsequently insert them back into the network. The presence
of this type of attack could cause instabilities to the vehicle
platoon or even collisions.

Let U represent the set of vehicles that are affected by

the attack. The state of an affected vehicle evolves as

(cid:164)ùë•ùëñ (ùë°) = ùë£ùëñ (ùë°),
(cid:164)ùë£ùëñ (ùë°) = ùë¢ùëñ (ùë°) + ùúâ (ùë°),

ùëñ ‚àà U,

(11)

where ùúâ (ùë°) is the intentional modiÔ¨Åcations on communicated
messages. Unlike a noise term that only moderately degrades
the system performance, an adversary could target speciÔ¨Åc
platoon members and carry out stealthy, adaptive and aggres-
sive attacks, which compromises platoon safety.

Assumption 1: Communication-related cyber-attacks do
not alter the physical properties of individual vehicles, which
means the integrity of the vehicle sensors and controllers are
protected.

Assumption 1 clariÔ¨Åes our focus on communication-based
attacks in this paper. In comparison to attacks on actuators
and sensors, message falsiÔ¨Åcation attacks do not directly alter
the targeted physical systems but achieve malicious outcomes
through modiÔ¨Åcations of system inputs. Although the ACC
controller shares similar feedback structure (i.e., ùê¥ matrix
structure) with CACC, they have different mechanisms to
obtain other vehicle dynamics information (through on-board
sensors). The immunity against message falsiÔ¨Åcation attack
and the fact
that physical system is still reliable under
such attack mean the ACC controller is an appropriate
supplementary controller in such an adversarial environment.
However, recall that ACC can not guarantee string stability,
which limits its suitability for long-term deployment in a
platoon.

IV. CONTROLLER SWITCHING FOR ATTACK
MITIGATION

In this section, we Ô¨Årstly present the overall structure of
the dual-mode control system reconÔ¨Åguration scheme and
Ô¨Ånd the conditions on controller gains that lead to GUES
and string stability for the proposed system.

A. A Security Game-based Switched System

Given the beneÔ¨Åts and limitations of both ACC and CACC
controllers discussed in Section III, we suggest using ACC
as a secondary controller operating as a back-up when the

communication network is suspicious. In this way, the advan-
tages of both controllers will be retained while minimising
the effects caused by cyber-attacks.

The overall structure of the improved upper controller is
shown in Fig. 2, which delivers insight into attack detection
and mitigation. Both controllers form a switched system with
the switching decision coming from novel game-theoretic
analysis of the attacker and the defender‚Äôs interactions.
Details of the game structure will be discussed in Section V.
A dedicated state constraint further enhances safety against
bounded but aggressive message modiÔ¨Åcations in which the
solution is bounded but violates practical constraints (ùúñùëöùëéùë•),
which represent vehicles nearly crashing. The resulting state
space is visualised in Fig. 3.

Formally, the switched system combined attack distur-

bance can be written in matrix form

(cid:164)ùëß = ùê¥ ùëùùëß + ùêµ ùëù ùëÖ + ùëÄùëùùúâ, ùëù ‚àà P,

otherwise,

where P is an index set of available subsystems and P =

state constraint |ùë•ùëñ ‚àí ùë•ùëñ‚àí1 + ùêø| < ùúñùëöùëéùë• is the aforementioned
switching surface, which deÔ¨Ånes the collision avoidance
boundary in Fig. 2 and 3. Note that, ùëÄùê¥ùê∂ùê∂ = 0 based on
Assumption 1.

B. Stability Analysis

Stability analysis of such a switched system is necessary:
even if both controllers satisfy the individual vehicle stability
condition (7), unconstrained switching may destabilize such
a switched system [31].

DeÔ¨Ånition 3 (Global Uniform Exponential Stability [31]):
A switched system has global uniform exponential stability
(GUES) if there exist a positive constant ùõø > 0 such that
for all switching signals ùúé the solutions of (12) with initial
state |ùëß(0)| ‚â§ ùõø satisfy

|ùëß(ùë°)| ‚â§ ùëê|ùëß(0)| exp‚àíùúÜùë° , ‚àÄùë° ‚â• 0,

(13)

for some ùëê, ùúÜ > 0.

Theorem 2: If conditions (16) are satisÔ¨Åed, then all sub-
systems of the platoon in (12) share a radially unbounded
common Lyapunov function, and therefore the switched
system has global uniform exponential stability.

Proof: The proof is based on the results in Chapter 2 of
[31]. It is natural to consider quadratic common Lyapunov
functions of the form (14) for switched linear systems,

ùëâ (ùëß) = ùëßùëá ùëÉùëß,

ùëÉ = ùëÉùëá > 0.

(14)

Assuming that (8) and (9) are satisÔ¨Åed, we have to Ô¨Ånd a
positive deÔ¨Ånite symmetric matrix ùëÉ such that the inequality
(15) is fulÔ¨Ålled

ùê¥ùëá

ùëù ùëÉ + ùëÉ ùê¥ ùëù < 0, ‚àÄùëù ‚àà P.

Remark 2: The conditions in (16) are sufÔ¨Åcient but not
necessary to achieve GUES. There may be other types of
common Lyapunov functions other than (14), which may lead
to other sufÔ¨Åcient conditions.

String stability of vehicular platooning is important for
long-term stable platoon operation. However, as discussed
in Section II-B, sensor-based control policy ACC fails to
guarantee this property. Due to erroneous detection results
(e.g., false alarms), the switching signal ùúé(¬∑) generated from
the security game may initiate control system reconÔ¨Åguration
process even if the vehicle is not exposed to an attack.
Therefore, we present a lower bound on the dwell time
ùúèùëõ for the string stable controller CACC to retain platoon
string stability of the switched system in an attack-free
environment. This constraint is updated dynamically at the
beginning of each interval on which ùúé = ùê∂ ùê¥ùê∂ùê∂ based on
the current system states.

Theorem 3: Consider a dual-mode control system recon-
Ô¨Åguration scheme that consists of a control policy (e.g.,
CACC) which guarantees platoon string stability and a
control policy (e.g., ACC) which cannot guarantee string
stability. Assume CACC is globally exponentially string
stable with a Lyapunov function ùëâ satisfying

The inequality ùëÄ < ùëÅ for two symmetric matrices M and N
means that the matrix ùëÄ ‚àí ùëÅ is negative deÔ¨Ånite. Note that,
if a matrix is positive (negative) deÔ¨Ånite, all its eigenvalues
are positive (negative).

explicit lower bound on ùúèùëõ to guarantee string stability for
the switched system, it is sufÔ¨Åcient to ensure that

ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)) > ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+2)),
Note that, ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ + ùúèùëõ)) = ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1)) and ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1) + ùõø) =
ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+2)) because the Lyapunov function is continuous.
Therefore, it is equivalent to satisfy

(21)

ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)) ‚àíùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ + ùúèùëõ)) > ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1) + ùõø) ‚àíùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1)). (22)

From (20), we have

ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)) ‚àíùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ + ùúèùëõ)) ‚â• ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)) ‚àí ùëí‚àí2ùúÜùúèùëõùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)).

Then, (22) will hold, if we have

ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)) +ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1)) > ùëí‚àí2ùúÜùúèùëõùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)) +ùëâ (ùë•(ùë°ùëõ+1) + ùõø).

By virtue of (17), we have

ùëè|ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)|2 + ùëè|ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1)|2 ‚â• ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)) +ùëâ (ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1)).

Then, all we need to have is

ùëè|ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)|2 + ùëè|ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1)|2 > ùëéùëí‚àí2ùúÜùúèùëõ |ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)|2,

which can be rewritten as

ùúèùëõ > 1

2ùúÜ log

ùëé|ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)|2
ùëè(|ùëß(ùë°ùëõ+1)|2 + |ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)|2)

.

This immediately yields the following lower bound on dwell
time in CACC:

ùúèùëõ > 1

ùúÜ log|ùëß(ùë°ùëõ)|.

Note that the assumption on exponential stability may be
justiÔ¨Åed in certain cases as discussed in [32]. Other estimates
in (17) and (18) can be used instead of quadratic ones. In
essence, all we need is for (21) to hold for all switching
times. We observe the further the system state deviation from
the equilibrium point the larger ùúèùëõ should be, meaning that
CACC controller should be activated for a longer time to
compensate the negative effects brought by ACC in terms
of string stability. Moreover, if CACC could be tuned to
converge faster, i.e. ùëê is large, then ùúèùëõ can be smaller.

Remark 3: The switched system may not guarantee string
stability when the communication-based controller CACC is
compromised in an adversarial environment. In this case, the
proposed switched system can be seen as an emergency mea-
sure to prevent a collision. Providing a switching function
that also guarantees string stability for this case is a research
direction for future work.

V. SECURITY GAME FORMULATION

We propose a non-cooperative cybersecurity defense game
played between the Attacker, the anomaly detector and the
Defender to guide the controller switching process in an
online fashion. By Attacker and Defender we mean the
malicious adversaries and the unit that generates switching
signals respectively. Note that, both players‚Äô actions and
detection reports are represented as edges and the resulting
states are represented as nodes in the game tree as in Fig. 4.
The game begins with the Attacker choosing whether to
attack the vehicle platoon or not, represented by the leftmost
branches in red. If the Attacker chooses to attack then it
performs the message falsiÔ¨Åcation attack as modelled by
(11). The notion of ‚Äúdetector‚Äù is kept very general to make
sure our game structure is suitable to various types anomaly
detection approaches with the understanding that the design
process for all detectors can not perfectly anticipate all
complex real-world situations and attack models leading to
a certain probability of error.

DeÔ¨Ånition 4 (Chance node): A chance node can be seen
as a Ô¨Åctitious player who performs actions according to a
probability distribution.
We use chance nodes to model the uncertainty about detec-
tion results as highlighted in green in Fig. 4. There should
be an ongoing update process regarding these prior beliefs
based on detection results in the real-world deployment.

DeÔ¨Ånition 5 (Information set): An information set of
player ùëñ is a collection of player ùëñ‚Äôs nodes among which
ùëñ cannot distinguish.
Once the Defender obtains the detection results, it is unclear
whether an actual attack has been performed or not. This
unique situation is modeled by information sets shown as
dashed lines in the Ô¨Ågure. There are two information sets for
the Defender based on the detection reports: one indicating
an attack and the other for no attack. This means the
Defender must consider the consequences of both an actual
attack having occurred, and no attack having occurred, when
an attack has been reported by the detector.

Lastly, after considering a rational Attacker‚Äôs action and
the chances of detection errors, the Defender decides whether
to downgrade the CACC controller to the ACC controller
or remain with the CACC controller, for example, in the
case when an attack is reported with low but non-zero

probability. The dual-mode control system reconÔ¨Åguration
scheme leverages the Defender‚Äôs decisions in the game as
the switching signal ùúé of the switched control system. As
shown in green in Fig. 3, the solution of the game activates
one of the subsystems (i.e. ACC or CACC) which in turn
generates new state values for another game before the next
switching is required.

Formally, we model the game with
‚Ä¢ Attacker‚Äôs action space A

ùê¥ := {ùëé: engage an attack; ùëõùëé:

not attacking}

‚Ä¢ Chance nodes (anomaly detector) ùê∂ := {ùëü: reporting an

attack; ùëõùëü: not reporting an attack}

ùê∑ := {ùëë: switch to ACC; ùëõùëë:

‚Ä¢ Defender‚Äôs action space A

switch to CACC}

The strategy proÔ¨Åle is modeled as (cid:104)ùëé, ùëê, ùëë(cid:105) for ùëé ‚àà ùê¥, ùëê ‚àà ùê∂
and ùëë ‚àà ùê∑. The utility values for the Attacker and the
Defender are denoted as [(ùëÖ ùê¥
8 )], which

can be chosen to reÔ¨Çect speciÔ¨Åc vehicle platoon security
trade-offs and risks.

A. Numerical Example

One instance of the game is shown graphically as in Fig. 4.
The utilities of each strategy proÔ¨Åle are highlighted in red
for the Attacker and blue for the Defender at the leaves of
the game tree. The example anomaly detector: 90% of the
time correctly reports benign data when there is no attack; it
makes false alarms for the remaining 10% of the time. When
an attack has truly occurred, this detector correctly reports
it 70% of the time and misses for the remaining 30% of the
time. Note that, these values should be calibrated based on
the deployed anomaly detector in different problem settings.
We use a popular open-source game solver Gambit ( [33])
to Ô¨Ånd Nash equilibrium solutions. A unique mixed strategy
is numerically computed. The probability distribution of
each player‚Äôs actions is shown under the Ô¨Ågure‚Äôs edges. For
example, the Attacker with the above utilities will attack with
82.98% of a chance to attack and if the Detector reports no
attack being detected, the Defender would still choose to
downgrade to sensor based ACC controller with 13.04% of
the chance to react to this high attack intention and imperfect
detection results.

Fig. 4: An example game model: the attacker‚Äôs actions are in
red, detection results are in green, and defender‚Äôs controller
switching decisions are in blue.

message falsiÔ¨Åcation attack, showing a crash without attack
mitigation (a) and crash prevention (b).

B. Simulation Example

The effectiveness of the proposed dual-mode control sys-
tem reconÔ¨Åguration scheme can be further demonstrated by
comparing simulation results as in Fig. 5. The simulations are
conducted in a sophisticated simulator Webots [34], which
supports realistic simulation of trafÔ¨Åc Ô¨Çow,
the ambient
environmental impact and the vehicle‚Äôs physical properties
(e.g., motor torques, body mass, suspension etc.). In the
simulation, the communication channel of the blue BMW
X5 vehicle is compromised. If there is no attack mitigation,
malicious message modiÔ¨Åcation would cause the vehicle
to accelerate and collide with its predecessor as shown in
Fig. 5a. With the proposed approach, the attack effects could
be signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced. Instead of a collision, the adversary
could at most cause the vehicle to reduce the inter-vehicle
distance. After reaching the minimum possible inter-vehicle
distance as seen in Fig. 5b, the scheme is able to guide the
vehicle to regain its desired inter-vehicle distance and relative
velocity.

Remark 4: The Nash equilibrium solution is highly de-
pendent on the utility values of both players and the detection
probabilities of the detector. Therefore, it is critical that these
values properly reÔ¨Çect the trade-offs and risks in terms of
platoon security. A detailed design of a machine learning
based anomaly detector and a set of utility functions that
fulÔ¨Ålls these requirements is ongoing research.

VI. CONCLUSION

Although V2V communication empowers vehicle platoons
with improved operation stability, the resulting high level
of connectivity and openness may attract communications-
based cyber-physical attacks. Consequently, we have investi-
gated a controller reconÔ¨Åguration scheme to mitigate attack

environment. This paper constitutes a Ô¨Årst attempt to use
security games to guide the switching process in the context
of switched systems, where the interactions between an in-
telligent attacker and defender in possession of an imperfect
detector have been investigated. Two common controllers
CACC and ACC for autonomous vehicle platooning have
been carefully analysed. A sliding surface based on a pre-
Ô¨Åxed state constraint highlights the inadequacy of common
stability deÔ¨Ånitions in this context and further guarantees
system safety. A minimum dwell time constraint is derived
to ensure string stability of the switched system in a benign
environment. While the presented approach is effective for
attack mitigation in short-term operation, we cannot ensure
string stability in an adversarial environment, which would
possibly require novel control designs beyond CACC or
ACC. Hence, an interesting open problem motivated by our
work is to ascertain whether a switching signal could achieve
string stability under communication-based attacks (e.g., to
Ô¨Ånd probabilistic string stability guarantees based on the
characteristics of the imperfect anomaly detector). Moreover,
additional simulation studies could support usefulness and
reliability when the low-level controller and vehicle models
are taken into account.
