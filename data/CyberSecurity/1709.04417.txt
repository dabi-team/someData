Abstract

Due to the ﬂexibility, aﬀordability and portability of cloud storage, individuals

and companies envisage the cloud storage as one of the preferred storage me-

dia nowadays. This attracts the eyes of cyber criminals, since much valuable

information such as user credentials, and private customer records are stored

in the cloud. There are many ways for criminals to compromise cloud services;

ranging from non-technical attack methods, such as social engineering, to de-

ploying advanced malwares. Therefore, it is vital for cyber forensics examiners

to be equipped and informed about best methods for investigation of diﬀerent

cloud platforms. In this chapter, using pCloud (an extensively used online cloud

storage service) as a case study, and we elaborate on diﬀerent kinds of artefacts

retrievable during a forensics examination. We carried out our experiments on

four diﬀerent virtual machines running four popular operating systems: a 64

bit Windows 8, Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, Android 4.4.2, and iOS 8.1. Moreover,

we examined cloud remnants of two diﬀerent web browsers: Internet Explorer

and Google Chrome on Windows. We believe that our study would promote

awareness among digital forensic examiners on how to conduct cloud storage

forensics examination.

1. Introduction

The usage of cloud storage, among individuals and companies, is increasing

day by day. Due to the recent report of the Forbes (2015), “47% of market-

ing departments will have at least 60% of their applications on a cloud platform

by 2017” [1], and “cloud market cap will pass $500 billion by 2020” [2]. Even

though cloud storage oﬀers several advantages compared to traditional and local

storage of data, cloud users are concerned about the integrity of stored data, se-

curity and user privacy issues [3, 4]. There exist several solutions which could be

considered by security experts in order to protect the stored data, and preserve

privacy of the cloud users [5, 6, 7, 8]. Adopting security mechanisms is useful

in protecting data against being modiﬁed and accessed by unauthorized users,

and make it diﬃcult for the attackers to abuse the data. However, the artefacts

which potentially remain on the cloud storage servers could threaten privacy

of the cloud users.

In such a case, security mechanisms might not suﬃce to

preserve users’ privacy. As a result, protecting the sensitive data against cloud

storage services, which leak the privacy of the users, is trending as an issue to

the law enforcement agencies and other digital forensic investigators. Moreover,

it should be contemplated that organized cyber criminals are always able to

ﬁnd new ways of evading the rules [9, 10]. This motivated several researchers

to conduct a number of cloud storage forensic investigations on various cloud

services and applications (apps) [11, 12]. However, with the ever increasing

introduction of such cloud services and technologies, having an up to date un-

derstanding of possible data remnants after using new cloud storage applications

is fundamental for forensic practitioner [13].

In this chapter, we consider pCloud 1 as a case study to identify the possible

evidential data that may remain after the use of pCloud on several diﬀerent

computer systems. pCloud is a free online cloud storage service (founded in 2013

in Switzerland), which has over four million users right today [14]. pCloud users

1https://www.pcloud.com/

2

are able to store, sync and share their ﬁles, as well as make backup from other

cloud services such as Dropbox. pCloud provides client-side encryption such that

the data, which are leaving the client’s system, are encrypted. Moreover, pCloud

has the Quality Management Systems (ISO 9001:2008) and Information Security

Management Systems (ISO 27001:2013) certiﬁcates. Due to the increasing use

of the pCloud, and several good reviews that it received from the cloud expert

reviewers [15, 16, 17], we are focusing on probable privacy issues of pCloud in

this chapter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst forensics investigative

study of pCloud. In particular, We will answer the following questions in the

rest of the chapter:

• What data (and the location of the data) can be found on Windows,

Ubuntu, Android, and iOS operating systems when using pCloud services?

• What data can be leaked while accessing the pCloud using Google Chrome

and Internet Explorer browsers on Windows operating systems?

• What data of forensic interest can be discovered in live memory on the

aforementioned platforms?

• What data can be captured from network traﬃc?

Before introducing our research methodology and contribution of the chapter,

we provide a brief literature review on forensic investigation of cloud storage

services.

1.1. Related Work

Computer system users produce a great deal of digital data day by day

in such a way that by 2020, the amount of produced data will exceed 40

zettabytes [18]. Therefore, in order to store such a data on cloud, we need

to have more fast and secure synchronization between servers and PCs; for

which services such as BitTorrent are very common these days.

In [19], Fa-

rina et al. conducted a forensic investigation on the BTSync client application,

and recognized the digital artefacts and network ﬁndings which could be then

3

used by digital forensic examiners as an evidence. Due to the increasing use

of cloud computing and cloud storage services, researchers believe that cloud

computing is more vulnerable to security and privacy issues, such as informa-

tion theft [20, 21, 22, 23], in particular considering online cloud services [24].

Thus, there is a surge of interest by forensic professionals and privacy experts

in cloud forensic analysis in recent years. In this section, we brieﬂy review the

state-of-the-art in digital forensics investigation of cloud privacy.

Compared to the other aspects of computer analysis, only a few research

studies have been conducted on cloud storage privacy investigation. Martini

and Choo [25] were the ﬁrst to carry out the cloud forensics investigation. They

analyzed the ownCloud as a case study, in order to ﬁnd client and server side

artefacts that could be useful as evidential data for forensics practitioners in

performing cloud analysis. With the gradual increase of Cloud storage services,

there is a growing tendency among individuals and organizations in using such

a service in order to store and access several diﬀerent kinds of data. Therefore,

most of the investigations on cloud context are concentrated on analyzing the

privacy leakage probability of the widely used cloud storage services. For exam-

ple, Quick and Choo analyzed the process of gathering data, browsing of data

and synchronization of ﬁles focusing on Dropbox [26], Microsoft SkyDrive [27],

and Google Drive [28]. In [27], the authors found the terrestrial artefacts which

are left behind when using SkyDrive on diﬀerent devices such as mobile phones

and desktop computers. Similarly, Quick and Choo studied the possible data

remnants on a Windows 7 computer and an Apple iPhone 3G when a user

adopts Dropbox [26] or Google Drive [28] in order to store, upload, and access

data in the cloud.

Along the same line of study, Hale [29] analyzed the digital artefacts remnant

on a computer after accessing or manipulating Amazon Cloud Drive. They could

recover several information, such as installation path, and upload/download

operations. In [30], Chung et al. presented new method in order to analyze

the digital artefacts left on all accessible devices, such as Mobile phones (e.g.,

iPhone and Android smartphone) and Desktop systems, running diﬀerent OS

4

(e.g., Windows and Mac) while using Amazon S3, Google Docs, Dropbox, and

Evernote. Contrary to most of the cloud storage services that are based on open

source platforms, Apple users, have their own special cloud storage called iCloud.

Oestreicher [31] investigated particularly iCloud service in order to ﬁnd leftover

digital droplets when using native Mac OS X during system synchronization

with the cloud. There are also various research studies on several diﬀerent

cloud storage services that we summarized in Table 1. We refer the interested

reader to [32, 33] for a comprehensive survey in this regard.

Outline. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows: in Section 2 we ex-

plain the research methodology and experimental setup. Section 3 presents the

results of our experimental analysis on pCloud. We answer the question “What

data can be captured from network traﬃc?” in Section 4. Finally, Section 5

concludes the chapter.

2. Research Methodology

In order to conduct a reliable digital forensic analysis, we should follow a

forensic investigation guideline [49, 50]. In this research study, we performed

our forensic investigation based on the framework introduced by Martini and

Choo [51] which is composed of four important stages (Figure 1):

Figure 1: Cloud forensics framework of Martini and Choo [51].

- Evidence source identiﬁcation and preservation.

In this phase,

we detect potential sources of evidences. We used VMware Worksta-

tion 10.0.2 build 1744117 to create the Virtual Machines (VMs) for the

experiments. We conﬁgured each virtual machine with 1 GB of RAM, and

2 GB hard disk space for Android VM, 15 GB for Ubuntu VM, and 40

GB Windows VM.

- Collection. In this phase, we collected the potential data resources and

ﬁles in a forensically sound manner.

- Analysis. In this phase, we analyzed the data obtained from the previous

phase. We considered keywords such as “account”,“password”, and “ﬁles”

to search for evidence in the memory. This chapter is mainly focused on

presenting analysis results of pCloud platform, however, we highlighted

the collection and preservation approaches as deemed necessary!

6

- Reporting and presentation. This phase presents the collected evi-

dences, in such a way that would be acceptable by the court of law. As

this chapter is only focused on presenting potential evidences; we just

shortly discussed this stage in conclusion.

2.1. Experimental Setup

We conducted our experiments on four diﬀerent operating systems: a 64 bit

Windows 8, Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, Android 4.4.2, and iOS 8.1. We consid-

ered two diﬀerent browsers:

Internet Explorer 10.0.9200.16384 and Google

Chrome 39.0.2171.71 m. We carried out our experiments using the digital foren-
sic research workshop challenge 2013 dataset (DFRWS2). We downloaded the
dataset on 08th December 2014 and evaluated the hash of the dataset to ensure

the integrity of the data. The dataset contains a main folder called test in-

cluding ten directories namely: au, b, img, js, ml, msx, pdf, txt, vid,

z. We carried out our investigation taking into account all the ﬁles included in

all directories.

We utilized Wireshark 1.12.3 to capture network traﬃc in all of the plat-

forms and experimental tasks running on them. Furthermore, we used Network-

Miner 1.6.1 to further analyze the captured network traﬃc. We captured physi-

cal memory in Ubuntu using memdump 1.01-6-i386. We used Hex Workshop 6.7
(6.8.0.5419 / 1st Sep. 2014) to analyze the captured physical memory of the vir-

tual machines, after the successful execution of each task. One of the main goals

of examining this type of application is to determine the possible remnants on

diﬀerent platforms using certain tools, which we explain in the following. Apart

from the sqlitebrowser 3.4.0, we also adopted iphonebackupbrowser-r38 for An-

droid and iOS.

2.1.1. Windows

In order to investigate pCloud remnants on a Windows operating system,

we considered two diﬀerent research directions: i) Windows web browser-based

2http://www.dfrws.org/2013/challenge/index.shtml

7

analysis, and ii) Windows application-based analysis.

As for the web browser-based investigation, we installed two popular browsers:

Microsoft Internet Explorer 10.0.9200.16384, and Google Chrome 39.0.2171.71

m on four VMs, and performed diﬀerent tasks speciﬁcally to the VM. Figure 2

shows the web browser-based tasks on the Windows VM. We updated Microsoft

Internet Explorer, and installed Google Chrome on the base machine. We then

cloned to four other machines for the following tasks: upload, download, open

and delete. Since it is a browser-based experiment, installation of pCloud was

not required, as the experiment will be directly focusing on interacting with the

pCloud in the web browser. We used all the folders and ﬁles from the DFRWS

dataset during each task. For example, we ﬁrst uploaded all the ﬁles during the

upload task, and then downloaded back during the download task. Moreover,

we captured network traﬃc during all the tasks.

The main artefacts which are recoverable from web browsers are from their

cache and history folders. Therefore, after performing the four aforementioned

operations (i.e., upload, download, open and delete) using the dataset, we an-

alyzed the cache using NirSoft IECacheview v 1.53 for Internet Explorer and

NirSoft ChromeCacheView v 1.61 for Google Chrome.

In order to conduct the windows app-based investigation, we adopted Win-

dows 8.1 Pro build 9600 with pCloud drive 2.0. We performed six diﬀerent tasks

as it can be seen in Figure 3.

Figure 3: Six diﬀerent tasks performed on Windows application-based, Android application-
based, iOS-based and Ubuntu-based VMs. It should be noted that, since we performed the
same operations for all of the four operating systems, we demonstrated all in one ﬁgure.

2.1.2. Android

In order to access the system folders on Android, the OS needs to be rooted.

Without the root access, there is no way of accessing the data which are required

to perform the experiments and capturing the internal memory. Also having

the root access, we will be able to run certain commands and access system

protected ﬁles. To interact with the given Android machine, we used a terminal

called Android emulator 1.0.5. We accessed the system protected ﬁles using

an application called Root Browser 2.2.3. With the help of this ﬁle browser,

we were able to locate diﬀerent critical artefacts related to the pCloud, such

as databases and log ﬁles. We used terminal emulator in order to capture the

processes which were running in the internal memory (RAM Capture) and also

to copy the captured ﬁle to the main investigation machine. We carried out six

diﬀerent experiments on Android based application (Android 4.4.2), which are

depicted in Figure 3.

2.1.3. iOS

In order to conduct experiments on iOS, we adopted an iPad mini running

iOS 8.1. However due to some authentication issues from the owner, we were

unable to jail break. We used iTunes 12.0.1.26, 64 bit, to back up the ﬁles after

performing the tasks which are shown in Figure 3. After completion of each

task, we took a back up of the whole ipad using iTunes with the use of iPhone

Backup Browser 1.2.0.6 (by Google project). We were able to track the changes

which was made during the installation procedure of the pCloud.

9

2.1.4. Ubuntu

We adopted the Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (Trusty Tahr) to carry out our inves-

tigation. We installed the pcloud drive 2.0 through the Ubuntu software center.

We also performed the uninstallation process through the Ubuntu software cen-

ter. We installed the pCloud drive on a main VM which was the “install and

login”. We also cloned this virtual machine for the other tasks: upload, down-

load, sync, open, delete and uninstallation (see Figure 3). In fact, we cloned

these machines in order to avoid the virtual memory being overwritten by the

execution of the next task, which would erase the evidence of the previous task

with the new evidence of the next task.

The DFRWS dataset contained various types of ﬁles, and we used all of them

in the experiments. For example, during upload, we uploaded all the folders and

ﬁles. After the successful execution of each task, we captured the live memory

using memdump 1.01-6. During carrying out all the tasks, we also captured the

network traﬃc using Wireshark 1.12.3.

3. Analysis and Findings

In this section, we present our experimental ﬁndings along with the data

anaylsis. In order to analyze the live memory we accessed the VM folders while

the VM was powered on. We analyzed this memory, using Hex Workshop, after

the corresponding task was successfully performed on the VM. It should be

noted that, if we do not mention a speciﬁc action (such as download, upload,

sync, or delete), it means there was no evidence which could be used by a

forensic investigator for further analysis of that action.

3.1. Windows Browser-Based Experiments

We ﬁrst set up the base virtual machine in order to conduct the experiments

over Windows browser-based. As all the clones had the latest version of the

Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, we avoided installing and updating the

browsers when conducting experiments. We started the experiments with the

10

“upload” VM, leading to the “download” VM, and after that “open” and “delete”

VMs.

3.1.1. Upload

We were able to acquire information such as uploaded ﬁle names and the

user names, which was used to upload the data to the pCloud, using Internet

Explorer. As Figure 4 shows, we could discover the folder path from the memory.

!

Figure 4: Windows Browser-based – Uploaded Files

3.1.2. Install and Login

As it can be seen in Figure 5, the passwords and the email address are clearly

discoverable from the physical memory, along with the interested ﬁle names and

directories. These information are valuable for a forensic examiner.

!

!

Figure 5: Windows Browser-based – Install and Login

We utilized NirSoft IEPassView 1.32 in order to analyse the saved data ﬁles

by the Internet Explorer. We found out that Internet Explorer saves the pCloud

credentials in the registry. However, search results do not reveal any kind of

information regarding the credentials in the Internet Explorer cache ﬁles, for

which we used IECacheview to perform analysis. Obtained results indicate that

all the uploads went through an encrypted server, making it diﬃcult to gather

much information about the uploads.

11

We also analyzed the memory image focusing on the Google Chrome browser.

We were able to retrieve remnants such as username and password which was

used to access pCloud (Figure 6). We could also ﬁnd evidential data through

ChromeCacheView for Google Chrome cache, along with the links which were

accessed during the tasks.

!

Figure 6: Chrome – pCloud credentials

3.2. Windows app-Based Experiments

In this section we discuss the evidential data we obtained while analysing the

pCloud application (app) installed on Windows OS. We explain three diﬀerent

tasks: Install and Login, Delete, and Uninstall.

3.2.1. Install and Login

Upon the ﬁrst installation of the pCloud on Windows, we have traced down

the changes that the app made on both ﬁle system and the registry of the

computer. The pCloud client created and modiﬁed the following address on the

disk drive:

Users\User\Documents\pCloud Sync. This address is used to

store the pCloud client ﬁles, the conﬁguration and some other necessary ﬁles.

Other than the system’s disk drive, pCloud has created entries in the registry

of the Windows. The Registry entries can be ﬁnd in the following locations:

• HKEY CURRENT USER\Software\pcloud

• HKEY CURRENT USER\Software\pcloud LTD\pCloud Drive

• HKEY CURRENT USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

We found out that pCloud creates some ﬁles in the Run and also Uninstall

folders of the registry. Other than changes in the registry and local hard drive,

we noticed changes in the rules for Windows Firewall in order to solve the issues

that may happen while connecting to the pCloud Servers (Figure 7).

!

Figure 7: Windows app-based registry changes in ﬁrewall folder

After reviewing the memory dump images from the Windows machine, which

pCloud client was installed on, we found out that we are unable to ﬁnd any sort

of plain text passwords. However, we have successfully found usernames within

the memory dump.

3.2.2. Delete

In order to analyse the eﬀect of the “Delete” action, we deleted some ﬁles.

We recognized that it is still possible to ﬁnd some traces of the deleted ﬁle names

within the memory dump (Figure 8).

!

Figure 8: Windows app-based deleted ﬁles

3.2.3. Uninstall

After the uninstallation process of the pCloud from the VM, we detected

two registry entries (Figure 9).

14

!

Figure 9: Windows app-based uninstall registry change

Other than the changes in registry, there were some ﬁles left on the disk after

uninstallation of the application, which were located at: \User\AppData\local\

pCloud. Moreover, we found out that pCloud client stores every information

such as “account information” and the “ﬁles summery” in a database called

Data.db on the computer. This database uses sqlite dbms system. From this

database ﬁle, we were able to extract diﬀerent kinds of data such as “uploaded

ﬁle names”, and “usernames” which the client used to access the pCloud. More-

over, by analysing the database, we found a table called “ﬁle” which keeps all the

stored ﬁles names. We could ﬁnd all the ﬁles, which we created on our pCloud

account. Furthermore, we were able to recover our pCloud account information,

such as “userid” and “username” in a table called “settings”.

3.3. Android app-Based Experiments

In this section, we provide our experimental results related to the pCloud

application when using Android OS. We considered three tasks: Install and

Login, Upload and Uninstall.

3.3.1.

Install and Login

Once the pCloud was installed on the Android platform, the following two

folders were created:

• /Device/data/data/com.pcloud.pcloud

• /emulated/0/.pcloud/

By using “Root Browser”, it is possible to locate those folders after com-

pletion of the installation process. Moreover, an examination of the memory

15

capture revealed useful information other than user login details, such as folder

paths, its database location and other pCloud related information. We recog-

nized that the database for pCloud was stored in the following locations:

• /data/data/com.pcloud.pcloud/databases/PCloudDB/

• /data/data/com.pcloud.pcloud/databases/PCloudDB-journal/

Analysing the database using Sqlitebrowser 3.4.0, it is possible to ﬁnd “user-

names”, “email quota”, and “tables”, which are related to pCloud communica-

tions. Once the pCloud was installed, We logged in from the account which

we created previously. Then, the system analyser dumped the whole memory

of Android and sent it to analysis machine for further analysis. We analyzed

the memory using Hex Workshop 6.7. In order to ﬁnd data related to the user

account, we used a search string (i.e., “account=”). This way, we could identify

the account which we had registered for the cloud storage (Figure 10).

Figure 10: Android – account details

Upon ﬁnding the registered account, we used it in order to check if it is

possible to ﬁnd more credentials’ details! Figure 11 shows the extracted artefacts

highlighted in yellow.

3.3.2. Upload

Considering the upload task, we could recover some of the ﬁles, which were

uploaded to the pCloud, from the memory capture. To this end, we used the

search string “ﬁle”. A part of the ﬁles are demonstrated in Figure 12 (the

highlighted parts).

16

Figure 11: Android – pCloud suspected credentials (highlighted part)

Figure 12: Android based – uploaded ﬁles

3.3.3. Uninstall

In order to investigate the possible evidential data which could be remained

on the memory after uninstallation of the application, we uninstalled the pCloud

application and captured the memory. We could recover some of the folders

which were already created in the installation process. We were also able to

recover some of the details by accessing the default browser in Android. We

logged into the pCloud service using Android default web browser, then we

analyzed the cache ﬁle, and browser history. We could recover evidences such

as website information, and some cookie ﬁles regarding the access of pCloud.

3.4. iOS Based Experiments

Examining iOS for ﬁnding possible pCloud artefacts was diﬃcult due to the

complexity of the OS, compared to other operating systems. Moreover, we were

unable to Jail break iOS. Therefore, we adopted backup investigation method

to detect the exact location of the installed pCloud.

17

!

Figure 13: Android Based – cookies and web page info

Upon installation of the pCloud on iOS, the folders/ﬁles which are depicted

in Figure 14 were created in the following locations:

• Library/Preferences/com.pcloud.pcloud.plist

• Library/googleanalytics-v2.sql

• Library/googleanalytics-v3.sql

• Library/Application Support/p.db

Figure 14: iOS pcloud folder paths

During the analysis process of the iOS backup ﬁles, we didn’t ﬁnd any lo-

gin details related to pCloud. However, we obtained some information such as

“session ID” (type of cookie which the web servers store for a speciﬁc user for

a duration of time), and “API key” (a code passed to the computer to identify

the calling program to its user), which then could be useful for Forensic Inves-

tigations (see Figure 15). Furthermore, we could obtain information such as

pCloud installation directory location.

18

Figure 15: iOS based – API key, Session ID Findings

3.4.1. Upload and Uninstallation

Even though we did not obtain pCloud login details on iOS, we could de-

tect some useful information such as “uploaded ﬁles names” (as highlighted in

Figure 16). Moreover, upon uninstallation we could recover some of the deleted

ﬁles. In order to access such information, we used several search strings such as

common ﬁle types, for instance “.jpg” and “.pdf”.

3.5. Ubuntu app-Based Experiments

During the experimental study on Ubuntu, we installed the pCloud drive 2.0

on base VM, and logged in. Then, we cloned it for several tasks, which we

carried out in the following sequential manner: upload, download, sync, open,

delete and uninstall. We analyzed all the acquired memory dump ﬁles using

hex workshop. We found quite a number of evidences in the memory. These

evidences are clearly useful for digital investigators in order to get to know the

“username”, “password”, and “ﬁles names” of the victim or suspects.

As it is demonstrated in Figure 17, it is possible to recover the “username”

and “password” of the user during installation and login process. These in-

formation have high forensic value to the forensic examiners as it shows the

credentials of the victims/suspects. Moreover, as Figure 18 shows, we can re-

trieve the uploaded ﬁle names and the ﬁle path from the memory dump. We

could also retrieve the same evidences as the ones extracted from the “upload

VM memory dump, during the sync and download tasks. As it is depicted in

Figure 19, after the deletion of the ﬁles from the app, it is possible to recover

“username” from the memory dump. This evidence can also help the forensic

examiners to identify the credentials that were used.

4. Network Traﬃc

Compared to the evidential data recovered from the storage and memory, we

could obtain relatively limited amount of data by analysing the network traﬃc.

This is mostly because pCloud uses encrypted connections, such as TLSv1.2

and HTTPS over SSL certiﬁcates, which are then provided by external vendors.

During the download and upload tasks, an encrypted connection is established

with protocol HTTPS.

In Table 2, we show some relevant IP addresses to pCloud, which we could

recover during the Internet Explorer experiment. We can conclude that all

the connections to these hosts were over TCP port 443, and used a TLSv1.2

Encryption. Apart from these IP addresses, we were able to track the service

providers for SSL certiﬁcates, along with the main login IP address/URL which

we could use as forensic investigators for further analysis. The recovered SSL

Certifcate providers list is as follows:

• http://silver-server-g2.ocsp.swisssign.net/

5. Conclusion

In this chapter, by analysing pCloud as a case study we demonstrated the

possibility to recover a numerous amount of residual evidences from this plat-

form. We analyzed the pCloud on several operating systems (i.e., Windows,

Android, iOS, Ubuntu) considering diﬀerent tasks (such as, install, login, up-

load, download, uninstall). We showed that all the pCloud credentials could

21

be extracted along with the ﬁles that were used for storage. Even though the

network connections were encrypted, some of the credentials used in almost all

platforms were in plain text format which is an added advantage for forensic in-

vestigators. However we were only able to collect login credentials by capturing

the live memory at the time of installation of the pCloud service. So it is highly

recommended for forensic investigators to capture the memory at the time of

installation.

Our presented research study in this chapter may pave the way for forensics

examiners investigating pCloud and other cloud storage platforms. In future, re-

searchers can use similar investigation method to retrieve other cloud platforms

remnants. Extending presented approach for detecting evidences of diﬀerent

platforms over cloud, such as investigating mobile devices connected to the

cloud [52, 53], investigation of cloud-based social networking platforms [54, 55],

and cloud malware forensics [56, 57, 58, 59, 60] would be interesting future

works. Moreover, analyzing legal and privacy implications of conducting cloud

forensics [61, 62] and developing relevant solutions could further opportunities

for real-world utilization of cloud investigation techniques.
