ABSTRACT
Towards sixth-generation networks (6G), satellite communication
systems, especially based on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) networks, be-
come promising due to their unique and comprehensive capabilities.
These advantages are accompanied by a variety of challenges such
as security vulnerabilities, management of hybrid systems, and high
mobility. In this paper, firstly, a security deficiency in the physi-
cal layer is addressed with a conceptual framework, considering
the cyber-physical nature of the satellite systems, highlighting the
potential attacks. Secondly, a learning-driven detection scheme is
proposed, and the lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)
is designed. The performance of the designed CNN architecture is
compared with a prevalent machine learning algorithm, support
vector machine (SVM). The results show that deficiency attacks
against the satellite systems can be detected by employing the
proposed scheme.

1 INTRODUCTION
The foresight becomes prevalent that satellite communication sys-
tems are the major parts of next-generation wireless networks due
to ubiquitous connectivity and coverage opportunities [6]. The
main drawbacks of satellite communications are propagation delay
and packet loss. However, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites alleviate
these problems to a reasonable level. Additionally, LEO satellites
come into prominence with lower launching and production costs
compared to high-altitude satellites. Therefore, their seamless con-
nectivity with terrestrial networks are envisioned to extend the
globalization and quality of mobile services, as new LEO constel-
lations have emerged with an increasing satellite number such as
OneWeb, Telesat, and Starlink [5, 16, 19]. Even though they of-
fer numerous advantages, LEO satellite networks bring significant
security requirements and impending issues.

Security concerns in satellite communication systems have been
gaining increasing attention, and emerging research studies offer
new solutions and analyses for different scenarios. For instance, the
authors of [10] provide an investigation of the physical layer secu-
rity for multi-user satellite communication and provide a threshold-
based scheduling scheme. Cooperative and non-cooperative beam-
forming schemes are proposed to maximize the secrecy rate in
[7], where satellite and terrestrial base stations are operated at
millimeter-wave frequencies. However, all of these studies focus
on the legitimate user data security and miss the attacks against
space-mission data systems.

Maintaining the correct orbit and altitude is one of the most criti-
cal points for continuous communication [15]. The satellites in LEO
are exposed to a more substantial gravity impact by the Earth than
high-altitude satellites. Therefore, they require an altitude and orbit
control (AOC) system to provide stabilization. As summarized in
Figure 1, the AOC system takes location data from the GPS receiver
and sensors, and it can command maneuver. Actually, maneuver de-
cisions are mainly given by the telemetry, tracking, command, and
monitoring system (TTC&M) which is located the ground station.
TTC&M systems sustain operational managements of satellites by
conveying telemetry and command signals. An attack on telemetry

or command signals can lead to interruptions in the communication
services of LEO satellites or collisions of satellites. These attacks can
be addressed in several aspects, such as confidentiality, authentica-
tion, data integrity, access control, or availability [3]. In this study,
the threats against the telemetry or command data availability are
tackled in the physical layer by considering jamming attacks.

The presence of jamming attacks must be detected primarily to
avoid or prevent jamming attacks. In [1], a generalized likelihood
ratio test based jammer detection is proposed by utilizing unused pi-
lots. In [21], two detectors based on variance and standard variance
normalization are presented against jamming attack for legitimate
communication. The authors of [4] propose a smart jamming detec-
tion method depending on the time-series analysis. However, these
solutions may not be sufficient to detect some special attacks. In the
recent years, solutions based on machine learning algorithms are
widely used for jamming attack detection and generation [17, 18]. In
[12], the authors present a learning-driven detection methodology
based on support vector machine (SVM) and reduce the hardware
complexity. In [8], machine learning algorithms are utilized to learn
spectrum and determine transmit decisions for both the transmitter
and the jammer. The authors proposed learning-driven jamming
identification schemes in [20] and [9] by employing convolutional
neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks, and SVM. They

show attractive performance thanks to time-frequency transforma-
tion based data pre-processing.

In this study, we firstly address a critical security vulnerability
for LEO satellite networks that may vary depending on the frame
contents, in accordance with the telemetry and telecommand signal-
ing structure. Motivated by this problem, three different jamming
attacks are considered by employing a conceptual signal struc-
ture; barrage jamming, pilot jamming, and intermittent jamming.
A jammer detection methodology is proposed based on shallow
and deep learning algorithms. The results prove that both detector
schemes provide high performance. However, the proposed CNN-
based detection scheme offers a superior performance for high SNR
compared to its SVM-based counterpart.

The rest of this study is organized as follows. In Section 2, a
system model is introduced conceptually to generate telemetry and
telecommand signals. The attacks are presented by considering the
target security concern. In Section 3, the learning-driven detection
schemes based on the proposed CNN architecture and SVM bench-
mark algorithm are provided. The numerical results are discussed
in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusions are drawn.

2 SYSTEM MODEL
2.1 A Conceptual Telemetry and Telecommand

Signal Structure

In this paper, an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
based satellite communication system is considered [11, 14]. There-
fore, telemetry and telecommand signals are structured conceptu-
ally as ùëÄ temporal OFDM frames in Figure 2. Each frame is delivered
in 10 milliseconds and composed of ùëÑ symbols. ùëÅ denotes the total
number of subcarriers. An OFDM unit, ùõºùëò
ùëû,ùëö, is located in the ùëûth
symbol of the ùëöth frame in the time-frequency mapping of the
signals, and it includes ùëã (ùëò) as the ùëòth subcarrier.

Signal generation based on the aforementioned structure is real-
ized by following the steps. The binary information is modulated
using BPSK. Pilot symbols are inserted uniformly between subcar-
riers for the estimation of the channel state information. They are
located based on comb-type pilot arrangement as

ùëã (ùëò) =

(cid:26)ùëãùëù (ùëü ) , mod (ùëò, ùëô) = 4,

where ùëü = 0, 1, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , (ùëÅùëù ‚àí 1), ùëÅùëù is the number of pilots, Xp =

is the pilot sequence, and ùëô is the
interval between consecutive pilot symbols. Null-carriers are in-
serted to both sides of modulated subcarriers, and the inverse fast
Fourier transform (IFFT) operation is employed to the data sequence.
It is transformed as

ùë• (ùëõ) = ùêº ùêπ ùêπùëá {ùëã (ùëò)} .

(2)

Following this step, the guard interval is appended to prevent inter-
symbol interference. By considering line-of-sight propagations,

Rician channel model is used [22]. The received signal is defined as
ùë¶ (ùëõ) = ùë• (ùëõ) ‚äó ‚Ñé1 (ùëõ) + ùë§ (ùëõ),
(3)
where ‚äó is the convolution operator and ‚Ñé1 (ùëõ) is the impulse re-
sponse of the channel between the transmitter and the receiver.
ùë§ (ùëõ) is an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean
additive white Gaussian noise with the distribution of CN (0, ùúé2
ùëõ).

2.2 Attacker Models
This study considers three different types of jamming strategies:
barrage jamming, pilot tone jamming, and intermittent jamming.
The jammed signal in the frequency domain in matrix form can be
written as

Y = H1X + W + H2J,
¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùëã (ùëò),

¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùëã (ùëÅ ‚àí 1)(cid:3)ùëá

where X = (cid:2)ùëã (0), ùëã (1),
(cid:2)ùëå (0), ùëå (1), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùëå (ùëò), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùëå (ùëÅ ‚àí 1)(cid:3)ùëá
are the transmitted and
received symbol sequences. J = (cid:2)ùêΩ (0), ùêΩ (1), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùêΩ (ùëò), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùêΩ (ùëÅ ‚àí

denotes the jamming signal, and H2 is the channel matrix
between the jammer and receiver. The following jamming attacks
are considered.

‚Ä¢ Barrage Jamming Attack: When prior knowledge about
the target signal does not exist, barrage jamming is optimal
jamming attack [2]. It can be defined simply as a noise attack
to the whole transmission bandwidth. The received signal
in (4) under this type of attack is defined with the jamming
signal vector J that is a zero-mean white Gaussian noise with
the distribution of CN (0, ùúé2).

‚Ä¢ Pilot Tone Jamming Attack: The pilot tone jamming at-
tack is a power-efficient jamming strategy compared to bar-
rage jamming. Only pilot tone frequencies are subjected to

noise attacks; therefore, it depends on the existence of the
knowledge about pilot symbol locations.

‚Ä¢ Intermittent Jamming Attack: The intermittent jamming
attack is designed by taking into account telemetry sig-
nal contents, including various information about satellite
systems such as satellite position, sensor data, and subsys-
tem conditions. If the attacker is aware of telemetry signal
content, they do not continuously attack the time or fre-
quency domain. We assume that the adversary knows tar-
get information patterns in telemetry data and attacks by
following this pattern. Intermittent jamming signals, JI =
(cid:2)ùêΩ (0), ùêΩ (1), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ùêΩ (ùëÅ ‚àí 1)(cid:3)ùëá
, are generated with the distri-
bution of JI ‚àº CN (0, ùúé2) by employing pattern as

before being fed to the CNN. Data quantity is another crucial point
since less number of samples causes over-fitting. Regularization
tools help to overcome the over-fitting effect. Batch normalization
and dropout layers are employed to reflect the normalization effect
in the training process.

The layers are employed consecutively in Figure 3. Convolutional
kernels are initialized randomly to generate uniform distribution. In
inter-layers ReLU activation function is utilized to take advantage
of simplicity. However, in the last layer softmax activation func-
tion is employed for its suitability to solve classification problems.
The training process is performed by using the Adam optimizer
algorithm [13] and categorical-cross entropy loss function.

between the OFDM symbols under this type of attack. ùê¥ùëù
and ùëë denote the attack periods in frequency and time. For
the numerical analysis, we have considered ùê¥ùëù = 4 and
ùëë = 5.

3 LEARNING-DRIVEN DETECTION
In this study, we propose a learning-driven detection scheme by
employing suitable machine learning algorithms. The detection
problem is defined as a binary classification problem. Two classifiers,
one based on SVM, and the other on the proposed CNN scheme,
are compared.

3.1 The Proposed CNN Architecture
The CNN solution is a reasonable choice in classification tasks
because of its adaptability, reusability, and operation portability.
Convolutional layers will behave as a configurable feature extractor
thanks to the convolutional filtering property. Essential components
in the CNN solution are the data quality and data quantity. Data
quality has an actual impact on the result of feature extraction.
Proper normalization and processing should be applied to the data

known as decision boundary, that allows the classification of data

(6)
where x, w, and ùëè denote the feature vector, support vector, and
bias term, respectively. SVM solves the classification problem by
maximizing the margin that is the distance between the closest
data points and hyperplane. When the data points are not separable
linearly, finding optimal hyperplane turns into an optimization
problem [20]. By solving the optimization problem with the La-
grangian function, the decision function is constructed as

ples; ùëéùëù and K represent the Lagrange multiplier and the kernel
function, respectively. According to the decision function output,
the classifier predicts the class of data sample.

4 NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
The telemetry or telecommand signals are generated conceptually
following the system model mentioned above with the parameters
in Table 1. We aim to detect the existence of a jamming attack that
can be realized with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and signal-
to-jamming ratios (SJR). As a solution, learning-driven detection
schemes are proposed. A data signal is composed by concatenating
10 OFDM frames, where each frame includes 60 OFDM symbols.
Short time-frequency transform (STFT) is applied to the received
signal as a pre-processing method that improves the detection per-
formance and discriminates the jamming signal characteristic in
both frequency and time. The example data samples are demon-
strated in Figure 4 and Figure 5.

Firstly, the detection schemes are analyzed under the proposed
intermittent jamming strategy that is more critical for satellite com-
munication security due to the importance of these control signals‚Äô
characteristics. Three datasets are generated under three different
SNR levels in Table 1 for training and prediction processes. A dataset
is composed of 2000 training and 3000 test data samples. The class
regarding jammer existence includes data samples in five different
SJR levels. Differently, we applied principal component analysis

with the CNN-based counterpart, which capable of extracting new
features thanks to the convolution operator. The parameters are

The benchmark results of the detection schemes based on SVM
and CNN show high accuracies, as shown in Figure 6. The SVM-
based scheme‚Äôs accuracies are 83.4%, 84.7%, and 86.1% for SNR, 5 dB,
10 dB, and 15 dB datasets, respectively. The SVM-based scheme‚Äôs
performance increases slightly depending on SNR values compared
to the counterpart. On the other hand, the CNN architecture based
scheme demonstrates a considerable increase in detection accuracy
where accuracies are 80.4%, 88.8%, and 93.1% for SNR, 5 dB, 10 dB,
and 15 dB datasets, respectively. Additionally, when all SNR values

are considered to analyze detectors‚Äô performance under a more
realistic scenario, three datasets are collected. The proposed CNN
architecture based scheme demonstrates superior performance with
96% accuracy than SVM based detector (84.9% accuracy).

Secondly, we take into account all types of jammer attacks and
generate three datasets for each SNR value in Table 1. Each dataset
includes 6000 training and 9000 test samples. CNN based detector
achieves 92.1%, 99.5%, and 99.7% when SVM shows 90.6%, 91.3%,
and 91.8% for SNR, 5 dB, 10 dB, and 15 dB, respectively. The results
in Figure 7 prove that the proposed CNN architecture provides more
robust performance in all SNRs than the benchmark algorithm. On
the other hand, both schemes demonstrate lower performance to
detect the proposed intermittent jamming attack detection, making
it critical compared to other attack types.

5 CONCLUSION
We proposed a jamming attack detection scheme based on machine
learning by addressing a crucial vulnerability of satellite-based
communication systems. The possibility of new threat types is
highlighted according to the telemetry and telecommand signaling
structure. By considering a conceptual satellite communication
system, intermittent jamming attacks are proposed together with
common attack types. The presented numerical results prove that
these types of attacks can be overcome by employing the proposed
detection mechanism.
