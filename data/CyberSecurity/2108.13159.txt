Abstract—The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications
that leverage ubiquitous connectivity and big data are facilitat-
ing the realization of smart everything initiatives. IoT-enabled
infrastructures have naturally a multi-layer system architecture
with an overlaid or underlaid device network and its coexist-
ing infrastructure network. The connectivity between different
components in these two heterogeneous interdependent networks
plays an important role in delivering real-time information and
ensuring a high-level situational awareness. However, IoT-enabled
infrastructures face cyber threats due to the wireless nature of
communications. Therefore, maintaining network connectivity in
the presence of adversaries is a critical task for infrastructure
network operators. In this paper, we establish a three-player
three-stage dynamic game-theoretic framework including two
network operators and one attacker to capture the secure
design of multi-layer interdependent infrastructure networks
by allocating limited resources. We use subgame perfect Nash
equilibrium (SPE) to characterize the strategies of players with
sequential moves. In addition, we assess the efﬁciency of the
equilibrium network by comparing with its team optimal solution
counterparts in which two network operators can coordinate. We
further design a scalable algorithm to guide the construction of
the equilibrium IoT-enabled infrastructure networks. Finally, we
use case studies on the emerging paradigm of the Internet of
Battleﬁeld Things (IoBT) to corroborate the obtained results.

I. INTRODUCTION

The massive deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) tech-
nologies provides ubiquitous connectivity for heterogeneous
machines and devices for data collection,
information ex-
change and operational decision-making. Therefore, IoT is
widely adopted in various application domains especially in
the infrastructures including smart grids, smart homes, intel-
ligent transportations, and smart cities [1]. With the current
information and communication technologies (ICTs), an IoT-
enabled infrastructure network has its own networking plat-
form that is interoperable within the existing Internet infras-
tructure. Hence, an IoT-enabled infrastructure can be naturally

viewed as a two-layer interdependent network consisting of
the infrastructure layer network and the overlaid or underlaid
device layer network. For instance, in the Internet of Battleﬁeld
Things (IoBT), the soldier networks equipped with wearable
devices are integrated with the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
ad hoc networks to perform tasks. The connections in the two-
layer network architecture can be classiﬁed into two types: (i)
the interlinks by which devices/infrastructures communicate
between themselves as well as (ii) the intralinks by which
devices communicate with the infrastructure.

The connectivity of an IoT-enabled infrastructure network
plays an important role in information dissemination and real-
time decision-making for mission-critical operations. Note that
devices can communicate with each other or with infrastruc-
tures to maintain a global situational awareness of the network.
Furthermore, the IoT devices which are scarce of on-board
computational resources can outsource heavy computations to
the data centers through cloud computing infrastructure [2].
IoT-enabled infrastructures are often vulnerable to cyberat-
tacks which can degrade the system performance, since most
of the communications within the IoT networks are wireless in
nature. For example, in IoBT networks, the communications
between a soldier and a UAV relay node can be jammed by
an attacker, and a soldier thus becomes isolated and loses
information and awareness of the battleﬁeld.

Therefore, to protect the IoT-enabled infrastructure from
adversarial behaviors, it is imperative to design secure and
robust two-layer networks that can maintain connectivity de-
spite of link failures. Due to the heterogeneous and two-layer
feature of the network, the design of the network is decentral-
ized essentially. Speciﬁcally, the network design involves two
players who design their own subnetworks sequentially. As in
IoBT networks, UAVs form their own relay networks, while a
team of soldiers forms a network based on the knowledge of
UAV locations to maintain the communications among soldiers
and command and control stations. The objectives of these
two network operators are to maintain the connectivity of the
global network by considering network creation cost, while
an attacker aims to disconnect the network at the minimum
attacking cost.

In this paper, we use a three-player three-stage game to
capture the secure interdependent IoT-enabled infrastructure
network design. At the ﬁrst stage, the network operator 1
creates links by anticipating the behavior of the network
operator 2 and the adversary. At the second stage, the network
operator 2 observes the links created by operator 1 and forms
links to secure the network by anticipating the adversarial
behaviors. Finally, the adversary observes the whole network

collaborations to secure the IoBT network.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
1) We propose a three-player three-stage dynamic game
to investigate the secure design of interdependent IoT-
enabled infrastructure networks. By considering costs
for creating and compromising links, the network oper-
ators aim to maintain the network connected while the
attacker’s goal is to disconnect the network.

2) We adopt subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE)
as the solution concept for the established game, and
analyze the SPE systematically including the optimal
strategies of two network operators and the attacker
through backward induction.

3) We quantify the efﬁciency of the SPE by comparing
it with the team optimal solution in which two network
operators can coordinate. Furthermore, we derive a num-
ber of meaningful results including the non-unicity of
equilibrium cost of network operators and the price of
seniority quantifying the beneﬁts of playing ﬁrst in the
dynamic game.

4) We design a scalable algorithm for constructing the se-
cure interdependent IoT-enabled infrastructure network.
In addition, we use case studies of IoBT to illustrate the
derived design principles.

II. RELATED WORK

With the increasing amount of cyber threats, security be-
comes a critical concern for IoT-enabled infrastructure net-
works [4]–[7]. The infrastructure networks face various types
of attacks in terms of the potential of cyber attackers [8]. For
example, attackers can target the edge computing nodes in
IoT including sensor nodes. Some typical adversarial scenarios
include node replication attack [9] and DoS attack [10]. The
attackers can also launch attacks through the IoT commu-
nication networks. In the eavesdropping attack, the attacker
captures the private information over the channel, and utilizes
the information to design other tailored attacks [11]. In the
data injection attack, the attacker injects fraudulent packets
into IoT communication links through insertion, manipulation,
and replay techniques [12]. In our work, we focus on the
adversarial attacks which lead to communication link removal
in the IoT-enabled infrastructure networks.

Different methodologies have been proposed in previous
works to address the cyber threats in the IoT and criti-
cal infrastructures [13]. In [14]–[16], contract and insurance
mechanisms have been adopted to mitigate the cyber risks with

Fig. 1:
Illustration of the three-player three stage game. Operator
1 can construct links within layer 1 and between two layers, while
operator 2 can establish links within layer 2 and between two layers.
Case 1: Operator 1 anticipates that operator 2 has the capability to
establish at least 6 links and the attacker is able to disrupt 1 link.
Thus, operator 1 does not create link at the ﬁrst stage, and operator
2 creates 6 links at the second stage, where the global network is
resistant to any 1 link removal attack. At stage 3, the adversary does
not attack as 1 link removal cannot disconnect the network. Case 2:
Operator 2 is able to construct at most 5 links. Thus, operator 1 needs
to construct 1 link at the ﬁrst stage by anticipating 1 link removal,
and operator 2 creates 4 links at the second stage. The attacker does
not compromise any link
and the network is connected at stage 3.

created by the two operators and launches an attack targeting
to disconnect the network. The two operators have aligned
objectives to make the two-layer network connected. However,
they have different costs or capabilities in forming communi-
cation links. For example, creating links between UAVs can
be more expensive than links between soldiers as the distance
between UAVs can be much longer. In addition, the differences
in network creativity and the ordering of the two network
players can affect the outcome of the designed network. For
clarity, we present an example in Fig. 1 to illustrate the
dynamic game model considered in this work.

We adopt subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE) [3,
Chapter 5] as the solution concept to the three-player sequen-
tial IoT-enabled infrastructure network design game. We ﬁrst
observe that the SPE of the game results in a k-connected
graph if the network remains connected at equilibrium. To
understand the efﬁciency of the Nash equilibrium network, we
use a centralized network design problem as a benchmark in
which both operators coordinate and design an optimal secure
network as a team. We further observe that the price of anarchy
(PoA) can be unbounded in general cases. However, when
two subnetworks contain the same number of nodes and the
unitary costs of creating links are the same with only a non-
null strategy of operator 2 at SPE, then the PoA is 1, which
means that the decentralized network design is as efﬁcient
as that of centralized one. Some counter-intuitive results are
further presented in Section IV-C, e.g., the payoff of operator
1 is unique at SPE while operator 2’s may vary. Finally, we
use case studies on IoBT to illustrate the design principles
of secure infrastructure networks. We observe that with a

[17], the authors have provided a comprehensive review on the
machine learning-based security schemes in the IoT systems.
Another widely adopted approach for investigating infrastruc-
ture network security is through dynamic games. For example,
the authors in [18] have proposed stochastic game nets for
stochastic games representation with Petri nets to study the
security analysis for enterprise networks. [19] has proposed
a dynamic game model
including pre-attack defense and
post-attack recovery phases in designing resilient IoT-enabled
infrastructure networks. In [20], the authors have adopted a
two-player stochastic game to investigate the network security
in which the nodes’ security assets and vulnerabilities are
correlated. [21] has investigated optimal design of two-layer
IoT network with heterogeneous security considerations at
different layers. In our work, we develop a three-player three-
stage dynamic game framework and study the operators’
and attacker’s strategies in defending and compromising the
network sequentially.

Infrastructure network connectivity is critical in information
exchange in many civilian and military applications. Regarding
the technical aspect, we investigate the secure design of IoT-
enabled infrastructure network by considering the connectivity
[22]–[24] using graph theory [25] and dynamic games [3],
[26]. Different from [19] which has adopted a dynamic game
approach in designing secure infrastructure, this work extends
the single network paradigm to various network operators
by considering the heterogeneity of multi-layer networks.
Comparing with previous works [22], [24] that have focused
on a single-layer adversarial network design, we establish a
two-layer heterogeneous network framework and characterize
the decentralized decision-making of each network operator
explicitly. Furthermore, the current work extends our previous
one [27] in multiple aspects. First, we include much more
analytical results with investigations on the properties of the
game in Section IV. Speciﬁcally, more results on the efﬁciency
of equilibrium are presented in Section IV-B, and the ﬁndings
in both Sections IV-C and IV-D are completely new. Second,
we provide a complete analysis of the algorithm including its
complexity and scalability in Section V. Third, we include
detailed proofs of all theoretical results which were omitted
in [27]. Fourth, we extensively expand the introduction and
related work sections as well as the case studies with more
examples and discussions to corroborate the obtained results.

III. INTERDEPENDENT IOT-ENABLED INFRASTRUCTURE
MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION

We consider two infrastructure network operators and two
sets of nodes N1 and N2, where nodes represent the devices
and infrastructures in the IoT-enabled network. The ﬁrst op-
erator controls nodes in N1 and as such can create wireless
communication links between those nodes as well as links
connecting a node in N1 to one in N2. Similarly, the second
operator controls nodes in N2 and can create links except those
in N1. For convenience, we deﬁne the following notations:

• E1 is the set of possible links between nodes of N1, that
is E1 = {e1 = (na, nb) : na ∈ N1, nb ∈ N1, na (cid:54)= nb}.

• E2 is the set of possible links between nodes of N2, that
is E2 = {e2 = (na, nb) : na ∈ N2, nb ∈ N2, na (cid:54)= nb}.
• E1,2 is the set of possible links between nodes of N1 and
N2, that is E1,2 = {e1,2 = (na, nb) : na ∈ N1, nb ∈ N2}.
Further, the number of nodes in two networks are equal to
|N1| = n1 and |N2| = n2, respectively, where | · | denotes the
cardinality of a set. Note that the created links by both network
operators are assumed to be undirected, i.e., two nodes can
communicate bidirectionally if they are connected with a link.
The adversarial IoT-enabled infrastructure network forma-

tion consists of three stages which are as follows.

1) At round 1, operator 1 has the choice of creating a set of

communication links in E1 ∪ E1,2.

2) At round 2, operator 2 can create a set of communication

links in E2 ∪ E1,2.

3) At round 3, an adversary can remove a set of commu-
nication links, e.g., through jamming attacks, that have
been created during the previous two rounds.

Note that the order of play between two network operators
are determined before the game begins. As shown in Section
IV-C later, playing ﬁrst or second impacts the utility of two
network operators in this dynamic game.

A network is a pair (N , E ), with N a set of nodes and E a
set of edges, or links between two nodes. At round 1, starting
from an empty network (N , /0), with N = N1 ∪ N2, operator
1 ∪ E 1,2
1 creates a set E1 := E 1
of links and thus designs
1
network G1 = (N , E1) such that E1 is a subset of E1 ∪ E1,2,
the set of admissible links for operator 1, i.e., E 1
1 ⊆ E1 and
E 1,2
1 ⊆ E1,2. Then, at round 2, starting from network G1,
operator 2 creates a set E2 := E 2
of links and thus
designs network G2 = (N , E1 ∪ E2) such that E 2
2 ⊆ E2 and
E 2,1
2 ⊆ E1,2. Finally, at round 3, the adversary chooses a subset
of the links EA ⊆ E1 ∪ E2 that it removes from G2, resulting in
network G3 = (N , E1 ∪ E2\EA). We denote the total number
of nodes as |N | = n1 + n2 = n.

One metric to measure the performance of the IoT-enabled

infrastructure network is its connectivity deﬁned as follows.

Deﬁnition 1 (Network Connectivity). An infrastructure net-
work G = (N , E ) is said to be connected if every node in N
can be reached from any others through a sequence of links
from E .

The goal of the operators is to construct a connected IoT-
enabled infrastructure network, i.e., a network where every
node can be reached from any others through a sequence of
links. Conversely, the role of the adversary is to obtain a dis-
connected infrastructure network, and thus a node or a group of
nodes becomes not accessible to the rest of the network. Note
that the adopted binary network connectivity metric is suitable
for mission-critical IoT-enabled infrastructures, e.g., IoBT. In
these types of systems, the connectivity among agents is the
minimum requirement and thus of ﬁrst priority of the network
operator.

In IoT-enabled infrastructure network, both creating and
removing links are costly. Let c1 and c2 be the normalized
unitary costs for creating a link for operators 1 and 2 in E1
and E2, respectively, and c1,2 and c2,1 be their corresponding

normalized unitary costs for creating a link in E1,2. In addition,
cA is the normalized unitary cost of the adversary to compro-
mise a link. Let 1G be the indicator factor that equals 1 if
network G is connected and 0 otherwise. Then, the payoffs of
operators 1, 2 and the adversary are, respectively,

U1(E1, E2, EA) = 1(N ,E1∪E2\EA) − c1|E 1
U2(E1, E2, EA) = 1(N ,E1∪E2\EA) − c2|E 2
UA(E1, E2, EA) = 1 − 1(N ,E1∪E2\EA) − cA|EA|.

In (1), we normalize the cost of creating and attacking links
with respect to the unitary network connectivity measure. Note
that
these constant cost parameters are directly related to
the monetary cost of creating and attacking links. To avoid
trivial solutions, the unitary costs c1, c2, c1,2, c2,1, and cA
admit a value between 0 and 1. Both operators adopt the
same type of communication technology (e.g., WiFi, Zigbee,
LTE, NB-IoT) to construct the links. Thus, both intralinks
and interlinks in the two-layer network have an identical level
of security. This fact leads to a uniﬁed unitary attack cost
for the adversary, regardless of the type of communication
links (i.e., intralink or interlink). Extension of the framework
to include heterogeneous attack costs is also possible. One
direction is to consider that the operators can construct secure
(with protection mechanism) and insecure links. The attacker
is incapable of compromising those secure links or very costly
to do so. We leave this nontrivial extension as future work.

In this work, we are interested in seeking the subgame per-
fect Nash equilibrium (SPE) of the three-stage dynamic game.
SPE is a reﬁnement of Nash equilibirum (NE) by focusing on
the sequential strategic decision-making of players, comparing
with NE that treats all players’ strategies as choices made once
before the play begins. An SPE has the property that in no
subgame can any player beneﬁt by unilaterally deviating from
the SPE strategy. Another critical property is that every SPE is
an NE (but not vise versa), as SPE is a more restricted solution
concept. Furthermore, SPE is a strategy proﬁle that induces an
NE in every subgame. A more comprehensive discussion of
SPE can be found in [3, Chapter 5] and [28, Chapter 5]. In
this regard, SPE is an appropriate solution concept for our
three-stage game. Speciﬁcally, we seek for optimal strategies
of the three players as follows.

Deﬁnition 2 (SPE). The SPE of the investigated three-player
three-stage game is a strategy proﬁle {E MAX

By convention, the adversary attacks the network when
cA|EA| = 1 and 1(N ,E1∪E2\EA) = 0 at SPE. This consideration
makes sense, especially in mission-critical scenarios, as the

attacker’s goal is to disrupt the network connectivity. Attacking
the network with success can still be an incentive-compatible
strategy for the adversary, even if it yields a zero net utility.
However, this convention is not strict, i.e., the adversary may
not attack the network in this boundary case. To keep the
notation simple during the SPE analysis (e.g., characterization
of k in (2)), we follow such convention. Note that the devel-
oped theoretical methods in later sections are valid under both
considerations. In contrast, the operators will not secure the
network if c1|E 1
| = 1, and
1(N ,E1∪E2\EA) = 1. Therefore, the SPE yields the equilibrium
topology of the two-layer adversarial IoT-enabled infrastruc-
ture networks.

Remark: We next comment on the information structure of
game. In this dynamic game, the adversary is the follower
and his optimal actions are best responses to the network
constructed by the two operators after the ﬁrst two steps. Thus,
the adversary does not necessarily know the exact link creation
costs of two network operators but reacts to the operators’
strategy proﬁle E1 ∪ E2 optimally by maximizing UA. In
comparison, both operators need to know the threat level of
the network captured by the unitary attack cost cA. With a
smaller cA, the operators strategies are more conservative by
anticipating more attacks. When cA is not precisely known
by operators, there are two possible ways to address this
challenge. The ﬁrst one is that, since cA is directly related to
the number of attacks, then the operators can estimate cA based
on the distribution of number of attacks using historical data.
The second approach is to model this unknown information
directly using a parameter θ , representing the uncertain type
of the adversary. Then, the operators determine their optimal
strategies conditioned on the random type parameter θ . This
yields a new dynamic Bayesian game which is nontrivial and
worth of investigation in the future work.

IV. SPE ANALYSIS AND ANALYTICAL RESULTS

In this section, we analyze the formulated three-player three-
stage IoT-enabled infrastructure network formation game in
Section III with a focus on the derivation of its SPE.

A. Backward Induction

To derive the SPE, we proceed by backward induction, i.e.,
we ﬁrst compute the optimal strategy for the adversary, then
operator 2 and ﬁnally operator 1.
Deﬁnition 3 (p-Connected Network). A network G = (N , E )
is called a p-connected network, if (i) it remains connected
after the deletion of any p links, and (ii) there exists a set F
of p + 1 links (|F | = p + 1) so that the network (N , E \F )
is disconnected.

Remark: Any connected network G = (N , E ) is a p-
connected network for some value of 1 ≤ p ≤ |E |. By conven-
tion, we say that a non-connected network is (−1)-connected.
The value p is called the link connectivity of the network. In
addition, a network is p-resistant if it remains connected after
the deletion of p links, that is, if it is m-connected for some
m ≥ p.

For notational clarity, in the following, we denote

k := (cid:98)1/cA(cid:99).

(2)

Note that the ﬂoor operator (cid:98)x(cid:99) and the ceiling operator (cid:100)x(cid:101)
denote the largest integer no greater than x and the smallest
integer no less than x, respectively. As shown in the analysis
of following Lemma 1, k can be interpreted as the maximum
number of links that the adversary may attack at the SPE. The
following result presents the strategy of the adversary.
Lemma 1. Let E1 and E2 be played by operator 1 and 2
respectively. Then, the adversary’s optimal strategy E MAX
is:
1)
2)
3) any F such that 1(N ,E1∪E2\F ) = 0 and |F | = m + 1 if

/0 if (N , E1 ∪ E2) is not connected,
/0 if (N , E1 ∪ E2) is m-connected with m ≥ k,

A

(N , E1 ∪ E2) is m-connected with m < k.

Proof. Note that since 1 − 1(N ,E1∪E2) ∈ {0, 1} then the util-
if
ity of the adversary is upper bounded by 1. Further,
1(N ,E1∪E2) = 0, i.e., if (N , E1 ∪ E2) is not connected, then
UA(E1, E2, EA) = 1 if and only if (iff) |EA| = 0, which is thus
the (only) optimal strategy.

Assume now that 1(N ,E1∪E2) = 1. Note that UA(E1, E2, /0) =
1−1(N ,E1∪E2) = 0. Thus, the optimal strategy of the adversary
is not the empty set iff there exists an F (cid:54)= /0 such that
1(N ,E1∪E2\F ) = 0 and UA(E1, E2, F ) > 0.

Let m be the connectivity of network (N , E1 ∪ E2). Let F
be a non-empty set such that (N , E1 ∪ E2\F ) is connected.
Then, UA(E1, E2, F ) = −cA|F | < 0. Thus this strategy is
strictly dominated by the null strategy and therefore is not
optimal. Reciprocally, let F be such that (N , E1 ∪ E2\F )
is disconnected. Then UA(E1, E2, F ) = 1 − cA|F | ≤ 1 − (m +
1)cA. Thus, the null strategy is optimal iff k ≤ 1/cA < m + 1,
and a non-null strategy is optimal iff m + 1 ≤ 1/cA < k + 1,
i.e., if m < k.

In a similar vein, we can detail the optimal strategy of

2

/0 if (N , E1) is k-connected;

operator 2 as follows.
Lemma 2. Let E1 be played by operator 1. Then, the operator
2’s optimal strategy E MAX
in the IoT-enabled infrastructure is:
1)
2) Otherwise, let F be the set of sets of E2 ∪ E1,2 such that
for each element F of F, network (N , E1 ∪ F ) is k-
connected. If F is not empty, we consider its element F
that has the minimal cost, that is the set of links F =
F2 ∪ F2,1, where {F2, F2,1} = arg minA2,A2,1
{c2|A2| +
c2,1|A2,1|, s.t. A2 ⊆ E2, A2,1 ⊆ E1,2}.

– If F = /0 or c2|F2| + c2,1|F2,1| ≥ 1, then the optimal
strategy of operator 2 is the null strategy and the
resulting payoff is 0.

– Otherwise (i.e. F is not empty and c2|F2| +
c2,1|F2,1| < 1), then the optimal payoff of operator
2 is 1 − c2|F2| − c2,1|F2,1|, and an optimal strategy
is F .

This result

leads us ﬁnally to the optimal strategy for

operator 1 in the IoT-enabled infrastructure networks.

We can thus draw the following result.

strategy for each of the 3 players.

Proof. We prove successively the two conditions:
(i) n1 + n2 − 1 represents the maximal number of nodes that
each node can connect to, i.e., the maximal degree. If this value
is lower than k + 1, then the adversary is able to disconnect
any given network with at most k link removals.
(ii) Note that for the network to be k-resistant, each node
should have a degree of (at least) k + 1. Since there are n1 +
n2 nodes, then there are at least
links in the
network. Further, E 1,2
should contain at least k +1 links.
Since c1 ≤ c1,2 and c2 ≤ c2,1, then these links are the ones with

In the following, we thus focus our attention in situations
in which the conditions of Lemma 5 are not satisﬁed. Further-
more, we denote the set of SPE of the game by L ∗.

B. Efﬁciency of the Equilibria

In this section, we are interested in how different the costs
are at the SPE and in a system where both operators can
coordinate. In the scenario where both players can coordinate,
the problem amounts to ﬁnding the optimal solution, and it
links. Note that this bound can be
uses at least
reached using Harary networks [29]. However, since the costs
c1, c2 and c1,2 are different, the Harary networks using the
least number of links may not correspond to the ones with the
lowest cost. We present the upper and lower bounds of costs
in the following proposition.

Proposition 1 (Upper and Lower Bounds). A lower bound on
the total cost for creating a network is

(at least) a degree of k + 1, then at least
links
need to be created, among which there should be at least k + 1
in E1,2 ∪ E2,1 so that the adversary cannot disconnect nodes of
N1 from nodes of N2.

An optimal joint strategy is to create all links of the form
(i, i + 1) with 1 ≤ i ≤ n1 + 2 and link (n1 + 2, 1). As this
construction forms a cycle of the n1 + n2 nodes, then it is 1-

connected. Further, it contains exactly
links, and among those k + 1 = 2 are in E1,2. It is therefore an
optimal solution. Its cost is CCO = (n1 + n2 − 2)c1 + 2c1,2 =

Next, we investigate the SPE of the game. The operator 1
plays the null strategy only if operator 2 can construct a 1-
connected network at a cost lower than 1. We then consider
the following strategy for operator 2 that consists in creating
all links of the form (i, n1 + 1) and (i, n1 + 2) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n1.
This strategy has a cost of CSPE = 2n1c2,1 = 2
3 < 1, and the
resulting network is 1-connected which can be shown by using
Menger’s theorem [30]. Indeed, for any nodes i and j, we can
construct at least two disjoint paths. For instance, if i and j are
both in N1, we consider the paths (both of length 2) i; (i, n1 +
1); n1 + 1; (n1 + 1, j); j and i; (i, n1 + 2); n1 + 2; (n1 + 2, j); j. If
i ∈ N1 and j ∈ N2, we consider the paths of length 1: i; (i, j); j
and the paths of length 3: i; (i, k); k; (k, (cid:96)); (cid:96); ((cid:96), j); j (with k ∈
N1, k (cid:54)= i and (cid:96) ∈ N2, (cid:96) (cid:54)= j). Finally, if both i and j are in
N2, then we consider the paths of length 2: i; (i, 1); 1; (1, j); j
and i; (i, 2); 2; (2, j); j. Note that this strategy is optimal for the
second operator, since it creates 2n1 links in E1,2.

In summary, the degradation of performance in terms of
9 which increases

PoA in this scenario is CSPE /CCO = 2n2
quadratically in n1.

We next characterize a class of scenarios in which PoA = 1,
leading to an efﬁcient decentralized design of secure infras-
tructure network.

Lemma 6. When two subnetworks contain the same number
of nodes, and the unitary costs satisfy the following condition
c1 = c2 = c1,2 = c2,1 < 1
n1(k+1) , and k < n1, then the PoA is 1.
Proof. In the scenarios that c2,1 < 1
, we know that at the
2n1
SPE, only operator 2 creates interlinks which are solely in
E1,2. Thus,
the cost at SPE is CSPE = n1(k + 1)c2,1. For
the cooperative case, the network conﬁguration is a Harary
network due to the same link costs. Therefore, the total cost is
(cid:109)
c1 in the optimal network. Due to n1 = n2
CCO =
and c2,1 = c1, we obtain CCO = n1(k + 1)c2,1c2,1 = CSPE , and
thus PoA = 1 in this scenario.

The following Proposition 3 shows that for given system
parameters, the SPE may not be unique. This, in terms of

infrastructure network architecture is not surprising, since
several topologies can lead to a k-connected network with the
minimal cost. More surprisingly, however is the fact that the
SPE may not be unique in terms of the costs.

Proposition 3 (Non-Unicity of Equilibrium Cost). For given
values of the parameters n1, n2, c1, c2, c1,2, c2,1 and cA, the
SPE may not be unique. More precisely, at the SPE, there is
a unique payoff value associated to the operator 1, but there
may be several payoff values of the operator 2.

Proof. We show the result by providing an example with the
property. Let parameters be n1 = 4, n2 = 3, k = 2, and c1 =
c2 = c1,2 = c2,1 = 0.09. From the values of c2 and c2,1, operator
1 knows that at the SPE, operator 2 builds at most 11 links.
Since each node of N1 needs to have a degree of 3, if operator
1 builds no link, then operator 2 needs to build at least 12 links
which is more than that it can bear. Thus operator 1 needs to
build at least 1 link. Then, depending on the choice of the link
created by operator 1, operator 2 needs to build either 10 or
11 links, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

In addition, the order of the operators creating their com-
munication links has an impact on the payoffs of the players.

Proposition 4. Consider an IoT-enabled infrastructure net-
work where the roles of the operators are symmetric, i.e.,
n1 = n2, c1,2 = c2,1, c1 = c2. Suppose that n1(k + 1)c1,2 < 1.
Then at the SPE, the payoff of operator 1 is 1 while that of
operator 2 is 1 − n1(k + 1)c1,2.
Proof. We consider the network (N , E ) with E ⊆ E1,2. E
is the set of links (i, j) with 1 ≤ i ≤ n1 and n1 + (i − (cid:4) k
(cid:5))
mod n2 ≤ j ≤ n1 + (i + (cid:6) k
(cid:7)) mod n2. Then, the network is k-
connected and has exactly (n1+n2)(k+1)
links. The operator 2
can construct a k-connected SPE network which has exactly
(n1+n2)(k+1)
2

= n1(k + 1) links all in E1,2.

2

2

Next, we investigate the impact of order of play between two
operators in constructing the network on their corresponding
payoffs. Speciﬁcally, we propose a notion, Price of Seniority
(PoS), to quantify the potential loss of operator 2 for playing
second comparing with the scenario in which he plays ﬁrst.
The formal deﬁnition of PoS is presented as follows.

Deﬁnition 5 (Price of Seniority). Denote C2 by the total cost
of operator 2 at SPE, and C(1)
2 by its total cost if it was playing

ﬁrst. Then the price of seniority (PoS) that quantiﬁes the loss
of operator 2 for playing second can be deﬁned as

PoS =

max
w∈L ∗, ˜w∈ ˜L ∗

C2(w)
C(1)
2 ( ˜w)

.

(4)

Recall that w is a strategy proﬁle including all three players’
actions, and L ∗ is a set containing SPE of the game. Similar
for ˜w and ˜L ∗ where the playing sequence of operators 1 and
2 is interchanged.

Furthermore, in the case of symmetric scenarios, i.e., n1 =
n2, c1 = c2, and c1,2 = c2,1, and denote C1 by the total cost of
operator 1, then PoS can be written as

PoS = max
w∈L ∗

C2(w)
C1(w)

= max
w∈L ∗

c2|E2 ∩ E2| + c2,1|E2 ∩ E1,2|
c1|E1 ∩ E1| + c1,2|E1 ∩ E1,2|

,

where C(1)
2

is replaced by C1 due to symmetry.

Corrollary 1. The PoS can be arbitrary large, and it is lower
bounded by 1, i.e., PoS ≥ 1.

Proof. Based on Proposition 4, we can verify that in the
symmetric scenarios with n1(k + 1)c1,2 < 1, C1 = 0 and C2 =
n1(k + 1)c1,2, and hence PoS can be inﬁnite. For generally
cases, we assume that w is an SPE of the original game.
Then, w is also a feasible strategy proﬁle for all three players
if operator 2 plays ﬁrst. Thus, we know that the utility of
operator 2 for acting ﬁrst C(1)
can at least achieve at a value
2
C2 resulting from the SPE w of original game. Therefore, we
conclude that C2/C(1)

2 ≥ 1, leading to PoS ≥ 1.
Corollary 1 states that playing ﬁrst is beneﬁcial for the
operator, and in certain cases the operator’s optimal strategy
becomes null if moving ﬁrst in the game. Knowing this fact,
the operator who has power to determine the order of players
will prefer to move ﬁrst by acting as a leader in this dynamic
game to gain more beneﬁts.

D. More Threats Induce Collaboration

In the adversarial network design, cyber attacks induce more
collaboration (fair share of the costs) between two network
operators. Speciﬁcally, when k is small, operator 2 may be
the only player in creating the whole connected network. As k
increases (and as the number of required links increases), the
cost for creating a connect infrastructure network increases.
Then, at some point of k when (n1 + n2)(k + 1) > 1, only
network operator 2 cannot create a secure infrastructure net-
work. Then, a set of new communication links is required
from operator 1 for the network to be k-connected. This
phenomenon can be summarized as: a higher level of threats
leads to collaboration between operators. Note that in some
scenarios, the cost of operator 1 can be larger than that of
operator 2 in network formation game. We illustrate these
results using the following example.

Example 1. Let n1 = n2 = 3, c1 = c1,2 = 0.19 and c2 = c2,1 =
0.21. Then, for k = 1, the cost of operator 1 is C1 = 2c1 = 0.38,
and the cost of operator 2 is C2 = 4c2 = 0.84. When k = 2,
the costs of operators 1 and 2 become C1 = 5c1 = 0.95 and
C2 = 4c2 = 0.84, respectively, where operator 1 costs more

in creating a secure network than operator 2. In addition, as
k increases, operator 1 collaborates more with operator 2 to
construct a k-resistant two-layer network.

and the SPE is (( /0, /0), ( /0, /0), /0). Otherwise, a network with e1
links for operator 1 and n1(k + 1) − e1 links for operator 2 is
created.

V. DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHM FOR SECURE
INTERDEPENDENT NETWORK CONSTRUCTION

With the obtained SPE in Section IV-A, the next critical
the secure interdependent IoT-enabled
step is to construct
infrastructure networks. In this section, we present an algo-
rithm to achieve this goal. For clarity purposes, we consider
the scenario that n1 = n2. Further, we suppose that n1 and
k are odd numbers. Knowing that in general mission-critical
infrastructure networks, creating a link between two networks
can be more difﬁcult than creating a link within a network
and thus induces a higher cost, we then have the conditions
c1 ≤ c1,2 and c2 ≤ c2,1 during the algorithm design.

A. Network Construction Algorithm Design

(cid:109)

(cid:108) n(k+1)
2

To construct a k-resistant IoT-enabled infrastructure net-
work, operators 1 and 2 need to jointly create a network
= n1(k + 1) links. This constitutes
that has at least
a lower bound on the number of links created (in a non-null
strategy). Since k is odd, by using Menger’s theorem [30],
we propose a construction using a superposition of exactly
k+1
independent Hamiltonian cycles. The algorithm for the
2
network construction is depicted in Algorithm 1, and for
clarity, we decompose it into 4 stages as follows.

Stage 1: (Algorithm, line 1–15) In this stage, we deter-

1 ∪ E 1,2

1 | and |E 1,2

|.
|. For a given e1, note that the cost
of operator 1 is minimized when |E1,2| is minimized (since
c1 ≤ c1,2). Further, for each node of N1 whose degree is d
(with d ≤ k + 1), operator 2 needs to create at least k + 1 − d
links in E1,2. Note that any link of E1 increases the degree
of 2 nodes in N1 by 1, while any link of E1,2 increases the
degree of only 1 node in N1 by 1. Thus, each link created by
operator 1 in E1 allows to decrease |E 2,1
| by 2, while each
link created by operator 1 in E1,2 allows to decrease |E 2,1
| by
only 1. Furthermore, for a given value of e1, the cost of the
second operator is minimized when |E 2,1
| is minimized (since
c2 ≤ c2,1, as long as the sum of degrees of nodes in N1 is less
than n1(k + 1) − (k + 1) since k + 1 links are required in E1,2).
Thus, for a given value of e1, both operators’ costs are
minimized when |E 1,2
| is minimized, that is when operator
1 uses as many links between nodes of N1 as possible, as
long as the sum of degrees of the nodes in N1 is less than
(n1 − 1)(k + 1). Thus, for a given e1,

e11 = |E 1

1 | =

(cid:26) e1

(n1 − 1)(k + 1)/2

if 2e1 ≤ (n1 − 1)(k + 1),
otherwise.

Thus, operator 1 chooses the minimal value of e1 and a set
of links such that operator 2 can construct a k-resistant network
with a cost lower than 1. Then, operator 1 computes its own
resulting cost. If it is higher than 1, then no links are created

(cid:106) e11
n1−1

(cid:107)
.

Stage 2: (Algorithm, line 16–24) In this stage, we form

m independent Hamiltonian cycles with m =

First, operator 1 creates links in E1 in a similar manner as in
Harary [29]. That is, it ﬁrst creates links between nodes i and j
such that (|i − j| mod n1) = 1, and then (|i − j| mod n1) = 2,
etc. From [31], we know that a 2m-Harary network contains
exactly m independent Hamilton cycles of N1, that is cycles
that go through all n1 nodes and such that no link is used more
than once. Further, [31] shows that there exists a construction
such that links (1; 2), (1; 3), ..., (1; m−1) all belong to different
cycles. Thus, we remove those links from our construction
and build all other links of the Harary network. We further
construct m(n1 − 1) links in E2 which are symmetric to as
those in E1. Note that these links in E2 are created by operator
2. Hence, this stage creates 2m(n1 − 1) links.

Further, for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, by constructing two links, one
between nodes 1 and n1 + i + 1 and one between nodes n1 + 1
and i + 1, we form a Hamiltonian cycle between all nodes
in N1 ∪ N2. Note that all m different cycles use independent
links. This further creates 2m links in E1,2.

Stage 3: (Algorithm, line 25–37) In the case where e11 >
m(n1 −1), then operator 1 still needs to create z = e11 −m(n1 −
1) links in E1.

In that case, we create an additional Hamiltonian cycle in
the following manner. Starting from node 1, we consider the
sequence i1; i2; ...; in1 with i1 = 1 and i j+1 = (i j + (n1 + 1)/2)
mod n1. Since n1 is odd, then for all 1 ≤ j, (cid:96) ≤ n1 and j (cid:54)= (cid:96), we
have i j (cid:54)= i(cid:96) or in other words the sequence i1; i2; ...; in1 deﬁnes
a permutation of indices 1, ..., n1. We then consider the follow-
ing construction: for j ≤ z, we construct the links (i j; i j+1) and
(i j + n1; i j+1 + n1) and for z < j < n1, we construct the links
(i j; i j+1 + n1) and (i j + n1; i j+1). This deﬁnes 2 sequences, and
each one contains exactly n1 nodes. By adding links (1; n1 +1)
and ((n1 + 1)/2; n1 + (n1 + 1)/2), we create a full Hamiltonian
cycle. Note that none of the links used previously have been
created since m < (k + 1)/2. This stage creates exactly either
0 link or 2n1 = n links among which z links are in E1, z links
are in E2, and n − 2z links are in E1,2.

Stage 4: (Algorithm, line 38–42) In total, either m or
m + 1 Hamiltonian cycles have been created and e11 links
have been used. We thus create the remaining m12 Hamiltonian
cycles with links exclusively in E1,2 that have not been created
in the previous stages. Here, m12 = (k + 1)/2 − m if z ≤ 0 and
m12 = (k + 1)/2 − m − 1 otherwise. A possible solution for
k < n1 is as follows. For all t that satisfy m < t < (k + 1)/2,
we construct a Hamiltonian cycle following this pattern: for
any 1 ≤ i ≤ n1, we create links (i; (i + t mod n1) + n1) and
((i + t) mod n1 + n1; (i + 1) mod n1) in the network.

The above 4 stages of construction yield an equilibrium

two-layer secure IoT-enabled infrastructure network.

An Illustrative Example: We next present an example to
illustrate how the developed algorithm works. The parameters
are summarized as follows: n1 = n2 = 5, k = 3, c1 = c2 = 1
20 ,
and c1,2 = c2,1 = 1
10 . Fig. 3 depicts the detailed steps of the

is critical when the system parameter changes and the equilib-
rium network becomes different and needs to be reconﬁgured.
In our algorithm, the main procedure in designing the secure
network is constructing Hamiltonian cycles sequentially in
both subnetworks and between two layers. This construction
pattern is highly scalable in the sense that when the number of
nodes in two subnetworks or the number of attacks changes,
the solution infrastructure network at SPE adopts with a
similar topology and only a small set of existing links need
to be rewired. The scalability of the algorithm will be further
justiﬁed using case studies in Section VI-C.

VI. CASE STUDIES

In this section, we use case studies of IoBT to illustrate the
optimal design principles of secure IoT-enabled networks with
heterogeneous components. In a battleﬁeld scenario, the un-
manned ground vehicles (UGV) and unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV) execute missions together. To enhance the information
transmission quality and situational awareness of each agent in
the battleﬁeld, a secure and reliable communication network
resistant to malicious attacks is critical. Note that the results
in this section are also applicable to other mission-critical
heterogeneous IoT network applications.

A. Secure Interdependent Network Design at SPE

20 , c2 = 1

45 , and c2,1 = 2

In the following case studies, we consider n1 = 9 UAVs and
n2 = 9 UGVs in the two-layer IoBT network. The normalized
costs of creating different types of links are as follows: c1 = 1
30 ,
c1,2 = 1
45 . Here, we can see that the
cost of creating intralinks across two layers is more than that
of creating interlinks within the network itself. In addition, the
normalized unit cost of attack is cA = 1
3 , and hence the attacker
can compromise at most k = 3 links in the network. The
above normalized costs can be transformed to their nominal
monetary costs when the basis ratio is determined. Based on
Lemma 4, we obtain that, at SPE, the UAV network operator
1 creates 10 interlinks within its own network, and the UGV
network operator 2 formulates 10 interlinks as well as 16
intralinks between two layers in the IoBT. Therefore,
the
1 = 5
equilibrium payoffs for operators 1 and 2 are U ∗
6 and
2 = 1
U ∗
15 , respectively. Note that the equilibrium IoBT network
is a 3-connected network, and thus the attacker is incapable
of disconnecting the system even with his best effort. By
using the designed Algorithm 1, we construct the solution
IoBT network resistant to 3 attacks and the result is shown
in Fig. 4. We can verify that operator 2 not only allocates
link resources in his own UGV network but also in the places
connecting two interdependent layers. Furthermore, each node
in the network is of degree 4, and the network is resistant to
anticipated attacks.

B. Impact of the Number of Attacks

We next investigate the impact of the number of attacks on
the adversarial IoBT network formation. Varying k captures
the operators’ belief on the attacker’s incentives. A larger

Fig. 3: Illustration of the secure network construction process using
Algorithm 1. Both subnetworks contain 5 nodes. Blue-colored links
are created by operator 1, and black-colored links are established
by operator 2. The network constructed at SPE is resistant to any 3
link attacks. Stage 1 of the algorithm yields the number of links that
each operator needs to create at the SPE. Stage 2-4 constructs the
secure network that satisﬁes the requirements. In this example, one
Hamiltonian cycle is created at both stages 2 and 3, while no further
links are constructed at stage 4, as network after stage 3 is resistant
to 3 link attacks.

creates 4 links in E1 and operator 2 creates 4 links in E2 and
2 links in E1,2. After this stage, the network is resistant to
1 link attack. At stage 3 (line 25 − 37), two operators create
an additional Hamiltonian cycle in our example, after which
each node is of degree 4 and thus the network is resistant to
3 link attacks. At this stage, operator 1 further creates 3 links
in E1 and operator 2 creates 3 links in E2 and 4 links in E1,2.
Both operators at stage 4 of the algorithm (line 38-42) do not
construct links, as there is no remaining Hamilton cycle to be
further created in E1,2. This example shows that the algorithm
can successfully guide the design of secure interdependent
networks.

We proceed to analyze the property of the designed algo-
rithm in this section. The ﬁrst one is the complexity. In the
construction of secure networks based on Algorithm 1, we
allocate the links in two networks sequentially. Depending on
the system parameters, the total number of allocated links is

is a lower bound in the
sense that it is the minimum number of links for a network
containing n1 +n2 nodes being resistant to k attacks. Similarly,
(cid:108) n1(k+1)
+ k + 1 is an upper bound for a secure
2
network where each subnetwork is resistant to k attacks and
another k + 1 links are allocated between two subnetworks.
Therefore, the complexity of Algorithm 1 is linear in the
number of nodes and the number of attacks, i.e., O(nk), where
n = n1 + n2.

Stage 1 (line 1-15): Network initialization; obtain the number of links to be created by operators at SPE, i.e., ℰ!!,#=0, ℰ!!=7, ℰ##,!=6, and ℰ##=7. Stage 2 (line 16-24): Operator 1 creates 4 links in E1, and operator 2 creates 4 links in E2and 2 links in E1,2. This stage creates one Hamiltonian cycle.Stage 3 (line 16-24): Operator 1 creates 3 links in E1, and operator 2 creates 3 links in E2and 4 links in E1,2. This stage creates another Hamiltonian cycle.Stage 4 (line 38-42): This stage creates additional Hamiltonian cycle by operator 2 if necessary. This example does not further create links at stage 4.Fig. 4: The 3-connected equilibrium IoBT network.

k indicates that the operators anticipating a higher level of
threats, and thus the designed IoBT network needs to be more
resistant. In the following, the link creation costs are the same
as those in the previous case study. We vary the attacker’s
capability k, and the obtained results are shown in Fig. 5. Fig.
5a illustrates the number of formed links of network operators
1 and 2 at the equilibrium IoBT conﬁguration. When the
attacker can compromise less than 2 links, the UGV network
operator creates sufﬁcient interlinks that connect UAVs and
UGVs. Therefore, the utility of UAV network operator is 1. As
the number of attacks increases, operator 1 begins to contribute
to the network defense because operator 2 alone cannot secure
the network with a positive payoff. For 2 ≤ k < 7, operator
1 allocates link resources only within the UAV network. In
comparison, operator 2 creates fewer intralinks and allocates
more resources in its own UGV network as the cyber threats
increase. In addition, when the number of attacks exceeds a
certain level, i.e., k ≥ 7 in this case, both network operators
will cease to protect
the network, and the corresponding
SPE is a null strategy which satisﬁes the second condition
in Lemma 5. Fig. 5b shows the utilities of two operators
at the equilibrium IoBT network. The operator 1’s payoff
decreases as k grows. Interestingly, in the regime where the
UAV network operator contributes to the secure IoBT network,
i.e., 2 ≤ k ≤ 6, the utility of UGV network operator remains the
same which corresponds to the maximum effort that operator
2 can use. Based on this case study, we can conclude that
higher threat levels induce more collaborations between two
network operators.

interlinks and 18 intralinks between two layers in the IoBT.
The equilibrium payoffs for operators 1 and 2 are U ∗
30 and
2 = 2
U ∗
45 , respectively. Figure 6 shows the constructed network
using Algorithm 1. We can see that comparing with the result
in Fig. 4, the links associated with those leaving agents are
removed and link rewiring only happens to a small set of
nodes originally connected with leaving agents. The major
network conﬁguration stays unchanged which demonstrates
the scalability of the algorithm.

VII. CONCLUSION

C. Impact of the Number of Agents

To illustrate the scalability of the designed algorithm, we
next present the results with different number of agents in
the network. This scenario is practical
in mission-critical
applications as the number of agents may change over time.
The system parameters are the same as those in Section VI-A
except that n1 and n2 are different (agents leaving or joining
the battleﬁeld). Note that as n1 and n2 change, the IoBT
conﬁgurations at SPE are also different. We present the results
when some agents in two subnetworks leave the battleﬁeld,
i.e., n1 = 8 and n2 = 8. At the SPE, operator 1 creates 7
interlinks within its network, and operator 2 formulates 7

In this paper, we have investigated the adversarial network
design for the interdependent IoT-enabled infrastructures. To
secure the heterogeneous components in the infrastructure net-
works, we have formulated a three-player three-stage network
formation game where two network operators aim to keep the
network connected in the presence of attacks. The subgame
perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE) of the game has been shown to
be an empty set when the number of communication links that
the attacker can compromise exceeds a threshold, or the link
creations are too costly for the operators. The price of anarchy
(PoA), i.e., the ratio of network formation costs between the
SPE and team optimal strategies, can be unbounded. Also,

we have identiﬁed cases where SPE solution is as efﬁcient as
the team optimal one, yielding PoA equaling 1. Furthermore,
with a higher threat level, we have shown that two network
operators are more willing to collaborate to defend against
attacks, since one operator alone cannot completely mitigate
the threats with a limited amount of link resources. The future
work would extend the dynamic game model and investigate
the case in which network operators can create secure links
and insecure links with distinct costs. Under such modeling,
the adversary also has heterogeneous attack costs to different
types of communication links.
