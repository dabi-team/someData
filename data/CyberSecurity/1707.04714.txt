Abstract— The annual cost of Cybercrime to the global economy is estimated to be around $400 billion, in support of which Exploit 
Kits have been providing enabling technology since 2006.  This paper reviews the recent developments in Exploit Kit capability and how 
these are being applied in practice.  In doing so it paves the way for better understanding of the exploit kits economy that may better 
help in combatting them and considers industry’s preparedness to respond.

I.   INTRODUCTION  

Intel  have  estimated  the  annual  cost  of  Cybercrime  to  the  global  economy  to  be  around  $400  billion[1].  Combating  cyber 
crime remains a major research topic in multiple fields of digital forensics[2],[3], including applications forensics [4]–[8] mobile 
device  forensics  [9]–[11],  cloud  forensics  [12]–[18],  and  malware  investigation  [19]–[25]    .  Despite  this,  the  cybercrime  rate 
continues to increase [26]! A growing contributor to  this increase, since the introduction of one of the  first examples “Mpack” 
around 2006[27], has been the Exploit Kit.  

Defined  by  McAfee  as  “an  off  the  shelf  software  package  containing  easy  to  use  packaged  attacks  on  known  and  unknown 
vulnerabilities”[28],  the  Exploit  Kit  serves  an  almost  infinitely  flexible  menu  of  malware  ranging  from  ransomware  through 
banking  and  backdoor  Trojans  to  rootkits.    By  exploiting  vulnerabilities,  typically  in  web  browsers  and  their  plugins  (Adobe 
Reader, Flash Player and Java etc.)[30]  the aim is often to achieve undetected remote control of the target device [31]. The arrest 
of the market leading providers in 2013[32], media reports of declining use and conflicting threat landscape surveys[33] are likely 
to lead to confusion as to their relative prevalence as a threat. 

This paper aims to first provide an overview and contextualize recent developments in Exploit Kit capability, illustrates how these 
are being applied in practice, determine whether the overall trend is one of market growth or decline and finally discuss industry’s 
preparedness to respond to exploit kits risks. The rest of this paper is organized as a Literature and Development Review followed 
by Discussion and some suggestions for Future Work. 

II.  LITERATURE AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 

In  December  of  2013  ENISA,  the  Cyber  Security  body  of  the  European  Union,  published  a  report  on  the  evolving  threat 
landscape[36].  Occupying  positions  number  1  and  number  4  in  the  list  respectively  were  “Drive  by  Exploits  (malicious  code 
injects  to  exploit  web  browser  vulnerabilities)”  and  “Exploit  Kits  (ready  to  use  software  packages  to  automate  cybercrime)  ”.  
Only two months prior, in October 2013 the alleged developer of the market leading Blackhole exploit kit, “Paunch”, was arrested 
in  a  move  by  Russian  authorities  [37].    At  this  time,  the  Blackhole  exploit  kit  was  reputed  to  have  around  50%  market  share, 
serving over one thousand customers.  The arrest was reported as a major blow to the cybercrime economy [32]. 

Just over 12 months later, at the end of January 2015, the impact of the Russian authorities action against the Blackhole providers 
seemed  to  be  reflected  in  the  declining  threat  of  the  exploit  kit.    ENISA  reported  that  Exploit  kits,  with  an  observed  trend  of 
“decreasing”, occupied position 8 on the threat landscape [33]. Further consideration of observed activity during 2014 and 2015 
does not however support the same  “decreasing”  conclusion.  Figure 1, provides a  summary of exploit kit prevalance in 2013, 
2014 and 2015 ([1],[28],[38]). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Major Exploit Kit Providers 2013-2015 

As can be seen from Figure1 out of the exploit kits observed in 2013, only a minority persisted into 2014, with four new entrants 
(Angler, Flashpack, Magnitude, & Rig) accounting for around two thirds of market share in 2014.  By 2015 the Paunch shaped 
hole  in the  exploit  kit  supply chain  had been  completely replaced by  another dominant  provider;  the  Angler exploit  kit,  which 
accounted for over 82% of observed attacks and infections. 

Consideration  of  the  exploit  kit  with  reference  to  the  Lockheed  Martin  Kill  Chain[34][35],  helps  to  understand  the  continuing 
appeal  of  the  exploit  kit  and  to  provide  some  context  to  some  of  the  most  recent  advances  in  exploit  kit  technology.  By 
automating the majority of the first 5 steps from Reconnaisance to Installation with industrial scalability, an exploit kit enables the 
cyber  criminal  to  instead  focus  attention  on  areas  such  as  affiliate  networking,  monetization  the  and  ongoing  evasion  of  the 
command and control network. 

Exploit  kits  are  usually  licensed  using  the  software/“crimeware”  as  a  service  model,  with  clients  being  granted  access  to  pre-
imaged  servers  on  which  to  load  their  binaries.    In  2013  the  Blackhole  kit  could  be  rented  from  $500  per  month,  its  more 
sophisticated  sister  product  “Cool”  from  $10,000  per  month.      In  2015  the  RIG  exploit  kit  is  available  from  around  $300  per 
month or by the day for less than $50 [39]. Grier et al.[27] further identified that instead of having to lure the victim and install 
their  chosen  malware  themselves,  the  Traffic-PPI  model,  powered  by  the  exploit  kit,  enabled  clients  to  simply  supply  their 
binaries and pay per install. This business model is further supported by affiliates, whose referrals to the exploit landing sites are 
tracked and remunerated on a model within which the exploit kit provider typically pays per thousand visits.   

Mirroring  the  legitimate  software  as  a  service  economy,  the  deployment  model  gives  exploit  kit  developers  a  high  degree  of 
control  over  their  source  code,  how  it  is  developed  and  supported.    This  approach  will  have  facilitated  much  of  the  recent 
evolution whilst preserving the almost ethereal capability of today’s kits to move between hosts, for the most part undetected. 

It is therefore within Steps 2 and 5 (Weaponization & Installation) that  the most significant changes have been observed in the 
last two years.  A small selection of the developments include; 

 

file-less intrusions, where Windows directory traversal vulnerabilities have been exploited, co-opting Windows utilities 
to act for the exploit kit [40] 

  XOR encrypted payloads being downloaded to the target machine which are then decrypted prior to execution[41] 

 

 

Just  in  time  assembly  of  malware  where  a  disassembled  payload  is  secreted  through  perimeter    defences  and  re-
assembled on the client using Windows powershell[40]. 

a reduction in the average age of the vulnerabilities being targeted, with many zero day exploits being woven into 
kits in 2015 [42],[43].  NSS labs reported that the average time for a zero day vulnerability to become known to software 
vendors  and  users  is  around  151  days  [44]  –  providing  a  significant  opportunity  for  integration  and  widespread 
exploitation within a kit.  For these vulnerabilities, which can be sold for up to $1m, the exploit kit  is likely to be the 
fastest route achieving a  return on investment. 

  DNS hijacking attacks directing users to exploit kits[45]  

 

the use of TOR for communication between infected hosts and the command and control servers[46], [47] 

Although the use of dummy functions, manipulating strings, and obfuscating code with commercially available software are now 
widely used, kits such as Angler, Nuclear and Rig have further developed their Installation capability. 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To  avoid  deployment  on  unsuitable  platforms  or  sandboxed  environments  which  may  attract  the  unwanted  attention  of  threat 
researchers, they seek first to identify the presence of virtual machines or anti-malware products which could frustrate payload 
delivery and/or expose operating practices. 

Angler  will  look  for  the  presence  of  security  products  (e.g.  Kapersky,  Trend  Micro)  and  virtual  machines  (e.g.  VMWare, 
Parallels).  Within the  Nuclear kit,  this  verification  happens even before  the target is redirected to the exploit  kit  landing page 
[46]. 

Developments  have  not  been  constrained  only  to  Weaponisation  and  Installation,  but  have  also  been  observed  within  Step  3 
(Delivery).  Although  Phishing  remains  a  successful  vector  for  the  Exploit  kit,  Malvertising  delivers  both  targets  and  ongoing 
income for the cyber criminal in a perversely ingenious business model: 

  Malicious adverts deployed by the cyber criminal lure potential targets to the exploit site, sometimes these “malverts” are 

procured and placed via third party networks, alternatively legitimate adverts are hacked 

  Targets compromised by exploit kits are recruited as unsuspecting zombies to botnets 
  These zombies generate fake page impressions on advertisers sites, delivering a click fraud revenue stream for the cyber 

criminal 

  Click fraud proceeds fund Exploit Kit development and the next campaign 

The US Association of National  Advertisers projected that advertisers  would lose $6.3 billion to bot related fraud in 2015[31].  
Analysing  5.5  billion  advertising  impressions  across  3  million  domains  over  60  days,  almost  one  quarter  of  video  advertising 
impressions were attributed to bot fraud.  When traffic was sourced via a third party, bot fraud rates rose to over 50%.  Prevention 
of these attacks presents serious challenges: 

  The Malvert behaves in many ways identically to a legitimate advert – offering up embedded content and performing 

frequent, often nested and seamless redirects to content served by third party advertising networks 

  As traffic is channelled through legitimate websites, web proxies blacklisting known bad sites provide little protection 

[40]. 

  The content delivered by third party networks is dynamic and constantly changing, so even forensic examination post 

infection is unlikely to reveal the same content as was delivered when the infection occurred 

In the beginning of 2015, a threat actor, dubbed Fessleak by security firm Invincea [48], used a Malvertising vector alongside the 
Hanjuan  exploit  kit.    The  attack  involved  the  Huffington  post  and  an  article  relating  to  the  Charlie  Hebdo  terrorist  attack.  
Payloads  included  remote  desktop  capability  and  an  ad-fraud  bot.      Fessleak  was  using  both  file-less  flash  and  Adobe  0  day 
exploits to deliver his malware. 

Finally considering Actions on Objectives, whilst the Exploit kit is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, McAfee report [1] 
the  cyber  criminal  now  needs  fewer  skills  to  take  part  in  the  industry.    The  Angler  exploit  kit  does  not  require  technical 
proficiency  to  launch  an  attack[28]  and  the  cyber  criminal  is  supported  by  initiatives  including  form  based  attack  creation 
programs and affiliate schemes. Sophos further suggest the dominance by Angler may be related to a better return on investment 
for those criminals funding the kit developers (more traffic, better infection rates etc)[38]. 

 In  April  2015,  it  was  observed    that  over  50%  of  the  malware  families  installed  by  Angler  were  ransomware,  including 
Teslacrypt, Kovter and Torrentlocker [38]. Attacks are not constrained to ransomware alone, in June 2015 a further malvertising 
attack was observed [49], this time using  interstitial advertising (web pages displayed before or after an expected content page). 
The malvertising led to the Hanjuan exploit kit which was exploiting vulnerabilities in IE and flash to deliver a banking Trojan 
payload – the aim being to steal passwords and credentials via a man in the middle attack.  The payload was itself encrypted and 
the kit used encryption between the command and control server. 

In early October 2015, following a successful intervention, CISCO Talos attributed around 50% of the Angler Exploit Kit activity 
to one primary threat actor, reportedly generating more than $30m per annum by targeting up to 90,000 victims per day[50]. 

III.  DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK 

It is clear that far from being in decline, the Exploit kits have been on an accelerated evolutionary path.  The last two years have 
seen the replacement of most Exploit Kits on the market and the emergence of an even more dominant player than was apparent 
in 2013 with the  rise of the Angler kit [50]. 

The  kits  are  more  sophisticated  than  their  predecessors  with  significant  innovations  in  Weaponisation,  Exploitation  and 
Installation.  Their  automated  delivery  capability  is  ideally  suited  to  mass  market  vectors  such  as  Malvertising  and  has  clearly 
powered the growth in click fraud and ransomware.   

Those  at  the  heart  of  this  business  have  achieved  Actions  on  Objectives  on  a  scale  which  can  only  be  described  as  industrial, 
generating revenues which eclipse most legitimate businesses[50].  It is also apparent that, surrounding the exploit kit provider, is 
an  opaque  yet  complex  ecosystem  of  actors  which  includes  exploit  providers,  malvertising  agents,  affiliates  and  crime  gangs.  
Whilst there are some excellent academic works, most current intelligence is emerging from the security industry, as attacks are 

 
discovered  and  analysed.    This  same  industry  however  appears  to  be  offering  numerous,  disparate  solutions  and  is  far  from 
consensus on the most appropriate strategies for prevention and cure. 

Advice includes selecting internet service providers with strong phishing and spam defenses, not opening unexpected attachments 
and using browser plugins to prevent the execution of scripts and iframes.  As some security insiders have elected to completely 
remove programs such as Flash [51], other vendors believe the perimeter focused, signature based detection approach is already 
flawed and we must instead turn our capability towards isolation, containment and observation[40].   

Reiterating  the  continued  requirement  for  proactivity  towards  areas  such  as  configuration  management,  patching  and  password 
security in order to reduce the attack surface, they also report that both business and consumers remain surprisingly inattentive[1]. 
In  the  midst  of  this  apparent  confusion  and  apathy,  ENISA  further  identified  exploit  kits  as    emerging  threat  number  8  in  the 
mobile computing environment and position 9 in the list of emerging threats to the “Trust Infrastructure” [33].  The latter is the 
code  and  data  we  use  to  ensure  trusted  connections  when  we  communicate  (encryption,  digital  signatures,  challenge/response, 
SSL…). 

An accurate appreciation of the threat posed by the exploit kit and the ways in which this could be addressed will require further 
clarity on their prevalance, their capability and surrounding ecosystem(s). What is certainly clear is that the exploit kit is bringing 
increasing sophistication to a cybercrime battle being waged on many fronts, together with the potential to extend the range and 
reach of the cyber criminal on an industrial scale.
