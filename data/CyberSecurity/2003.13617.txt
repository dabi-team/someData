Abstract—In the next few years, Blockchain will play a central
role in IoT as a technology. It enables the traceability of processes
between multiple parties independent of a central
instance.
Blockchain allows to make the processes more transparent,
cheaper, and safer. This research paper was conducted as system-
atic literature search. Our aim is to understand current state of
implementation in context of Blockchain Technology for digital
protection of communication in industrial cyber-physical systems.
We have extracted 28 primary papers from scientiﬁc databases
and classiﬁed into different categories using visualizations. The
results show that the focus in around 14% papers is on solution
proposal and implementation of use cases ”Secure transfer of
order data” using Ethereum Blockchain, 7% papers applying
Hyperledger Fabric and Multichain. The majority of research
(around 43%) is focusing on solution development for supply
chain and process traceability.

I. INTRODUCTION

The success of the manufacturing industry based on the
revolutionary innovations in various technologies in hardware
and software [1]. The conception of the Internet of Things
(IoT) has already become a part of modern factories for
automatizing of large-scale processes [2].

Manufacturing sector brings many different stakeholders
together. This industry has mostly common fraud problems
comparing to any sector. The signiﬁcant rate (56%) of respon-
dents reported the issues related to vendor or procurement
fraud [3]. For some companies developing know-how prod-
ucts, intellectual property infringement could be fatal for the
whole business. Not surprisingly, these issues make companies
look for new ways to avoid them [4].

is
Blockchain technology, which stays behind Bitcoin,
nowadays a hype technology [5]. Its development could be

revolutionized like the appearance of the Internet at the begin-
ning of 90th’s. Blockchain provides a secure mechanism for
achieving an independent trusted between business partners,
excluding intermediaries. The rest of the paper is organized
as follows. Section II discusses information about research
methods. In Section III illustrates the results of searching and
screening for relevant papers for this research, while section
IV answers the research questions using these results. Section
V concludes the paper.

A. Overview of Blockchain

Blockchain is a new and successful combination of existing
technologies. The technical concept of Blockchain describes
how data are distributed saved across the user systems using
cryptography algorithm. Blockchain organized logically cen-
tralized and organizationally decentralized. As a result, the
Blockchain represents a distributed database that maintains
an ever-expanding list of decentralized transaction, events, or
records in hash form. The data is maintained in a distributed
register (Distributed Ledger Technology) and all participants
have a copy of the entire register. In this distributed approach,
the data is grouped into individual blocks that are linked
together to ensure the chronological order and immutable data
integrity of the entire data set [6].

The innovation of Blockchain technology is that existing
approaches have been successfully put together. Following
approaches are the main components of Blockchain:

• Peer-to-peer network: In this peer-to-peer network (P2P
network), communication runs without a central point.
All participants or nodes are connected to each other and
communicate with each other at the same level. Since
the nodes are equal to each other, or can use services

 
 
 
 
 
 
and make them available at the same time, there is no
classic client-server structure [5].

• Cryptography: With the help of methods from cryp-
tography,
the distributed register is protected against
manipulation and abuse. This enables traceability, data
integrity and authentication of the data source [7].

• Consensus mechanism: The consensus mechanism de-
ﬁnes the criteria that provide evidence of permission to
create new blocks (mining). To reach a consensus, various
consensus algorithms have been developed [8].

Due to the different uses of Blockchain technology, there are
different variations on how the Blockchain is constructed. In a
public Blockchain, there are no restrictions on who can see the
public data and validate the transactions [7]. Furthermore, the
Blockchain data may be encrypted and understandable only
to the authorized user. In the case of a private Blockchain,
the completed consortium of those who access the Blockchain
and are allowed to validate transactions is predeﬁned [9]. In
a permissionless Blockchain, there are no restrictions on the
identity of the participants who are allowed to conduct the
transactions. In a permissioned Blockchain, the user group
that can execute the transactions and generate new blocks is
predeﬁned and known [10].

B. Smart Contracts

In addition to a decentralized database system for transac-
tions, Blockchain technology is also a platform for the automa-
tion of processes, regulations and organizational principles.
Smart contracts are new, intelligent forms of contracts. These
are to be understood as peer-to-peer applications, which are
distributed with the underlying Blockchain technology, such
as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Hyperledger. Hyperledger also uses
the term ”chaincode” [11].

The smart contracts enable the determination of the condi-
tions that lead to certain decisions by the data provided; the
automatic processing of contracts; the permanent and real-time
monitoring of contract terms and the automatic enforcement
of the rights of contractors. The smart contracts provide not
only the information about the Blockchain network and the
distribution of data, but also the business logic [12].

These P2P applications can be programmed, stored in the
Blockchain and executed in there. Therefore, they have the
same advantages as the Blockchain itself. In Bitcoin,
the
smart contracts are created in the form of scripts. In order
to simplify the development of smart contracts for Ethereum
platform, a new speciﬁc programming language ”Solidity” has
been developed [13]. Compared to the scripting language in
Bitcoin, where many program constructs, such as loops, are
missing, Solidity is a higher-level, more abstract language that
resembles the JavaScript language. The chain codes are written
in various high-level languages, such as Java or Go, and during
execution, access is made to the data stored in the Blockchain,
or to read out the existing information and store new ones.
These scripts are stored in the Blockchain at a particular
address. This address is determined when the integration of
smart contract into the Blockchain is decided. When an event

prescribed in the contract has occurred, a transaction is sent
to this address. The distributed virtual machine executes the
code of the script using the data sent with the transaction.

C. State of Research on Blockchain

Yli-Huumo et. al [14] aim to understand the current re-
search state of Blockchain technology, its technical challenges
and limitations. This systematic review illustrates an sharply
increasing number of publications each year beginning from
2012. It shows a growing interest in Blockchain technology.
Swan [15] identiﬁed seven technical challenges of Blockchain
for the future. Modern Blockchain implementations have
to ensure security, throughput, size and bandwidth, perfor-
mance, usability, data integrity and scalability. Being public
Blockchains the throughput
in the Bitcoin and Ethereum
networks is from 10tps to 100tps (transactions per second).
For example, VISA Payment System proceeds 2,000tps. But a
permissioned Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric overcomes these
challenges [16]. In order to achieve adequate security in the
Bitcoin network validation of transaction takes roughly 10
minutes (latency). In February 2016 the size of Bitcoin register
was 50,000 MB. Current size of Bitcoin is 1 MB. This is
the serious limitation of bandwidths for Blockchain, which
should be solved to increase amount of transaction handled
by register. The 51% attach on Blockchain network is still
signiﬁcant security issue. If the majority of the network will
be controlled by hackers, it will be possible to manipulate
Blockchain. Issue of waster resources is caused by Proof-of-
Work effort in the mining process mainly in Bitcoin, which
required huge amounts of energy. But there are other consen-
sus algorithms, like Proof-Of-Stake, which are energy friendly.
Usability problems resulting from difﬁculty of using Bitcoin
API [14]. Versioning, hard forks, multiple chains refers to a
small chain with a small number of nodes, where a possibility
of 51% attach is higher. Another issue become possible when
chains are split for administrative or versioning purposes.

II. RESEARCH METHOD

A systematic mapping study was selected to identify and
classify primary studies to provide a systematic overview
on the topics of industrial manufacturing and Blockchain.
Petersen et al. [17] presented the guidelines for systematic
mapping study, which we followed to conduct this study.

The process for the systematic mapping study falls into a
ﬁve-phase process as depicted in Figure 1: (1) Deﬁne research
questions; (2) Search for primary studies; (3) Identify inclusion
and exclusion criteria and screen primary studies based on
these criteria; (4) Classify primary studies; (5) Mapping the
data.

A. Research questions

The ﬁrst step in systematic mapping study is the deﬁnition
of the research questions. The purpose of this research is to
classify current research and identify pertinent themes which
relate directly to Blockchain technologies in manufacturing.

Fig. 1. The Systematic Mapping Process [17].

This leads to the following research questions (RQs):

RQ1: What are the problems between stakeholders in the

manufacturing industry?
Rationale: The intention of this question is to identify current
gaps in relationships of interested parties in manufacturing
industry.

RQ2: What are the data to secure in manufacturing

process?
Rationale: This question aims to identify the data, which
should be insured during the whole process.

RQ3: What are the use cases of Blockchain technology for

manufacturing industry?
Rationale: The intention of this question is to ﬁgure out the
possible usage of Blockchain in manufacturing area.

RQ4: What Blockchain frameworks are suitable for the
scenario ”Assignment of production orders to an external
manufacturer”?
Rationale: With this question, we investigate the existing
Blockchain solutions to ﬁnd appropriate framework.

B. Search Strategy

The search strategy is key to ensure a good starting point
for the identiﬁcation of studies and ultimately for the actual
outcome of the study. An extensive and broad set of primary
studies was needed to answer the research questions. The most
popular academic databases in the domain of software engi-
neering were selected to be used in this systematic mapping
to search for potentially relevant papers:

• ACM Digital Library1
• IEEE Xplore Digital Library2
• Scopus3
• Science Direct4

1http://dl.acm.org
2http://ieeexplore.ieee.org
3https://www.scopus.com
4https://www.sciencedirect.com

Finding possibly relevant publications to answer the re-
search questions requires creating an appropriate search clause.
We chose the terms ”Blockchain” and ”Manufacturing in-
dustry” for this study as the main search keyword core, it
focuses on Blockchain technology, manufacturing, production
processes. The ﬁnal search strings were extended with alter-
native synonyms for main keywords. The term ”distributed
ledger” is a basic technology for ”blockchain”. We considered
papers mentioning distributed manufacturing, manufacturing
execution, programmable logic controller” and included them
into the search clause. Regarding the keywords for the search,
after some exploratory searches using different combination of
keywords, the researchers jointly established the ﬁnal string to
be used in the search for papers in the databases. Search terms
with similar meanings were grouped in the same group and
combined using the OR logical operator. To perform automatic
searches in the selected digital libraries, the AND logical
operator were used between combined terms of different
groups, depicted in Table II-B:

papers were retrieved from the different databases, which are

focusing on research regarding information technologies, as
on 21st May 2019, 10.30 am (CEST) and displayed in Table

C. Screening for relevant papers

This step is to exclude all

research papers that are
irrelevant to the research questions. To accomplish this step,
We followed the screening approach described by Yli-Huumo
et al. [14] and deﬁned inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Inclusion criteria

To be considered for inclusion in the study, the research
being evaluated had to originate from an academic source,
such as a journal or conference, and clearly show its
focused on applying Blockchain in
contribution was
manufacturing. Studies are accessible electronically. The
paper title includes ”Blockchain”.

Exclusion criteria

For those publications that passed the inclusion criteria, two
ﬁlters were applied to reduce the publications to only those
that were deemed to be directly aligned with the focus of the
study. These ﬁlters are described as follows:

• Study focuses on ﬁnancial sector
• Study contains ”Bitcoin” or ”Cryptocurrency”

It was decided to apply exclusion criteria on titles, keywords,
abstracts and full-text. The ﬁnal inclusion or exclusion could
be decided based on the reading of publications full text.
this phase only eliminates publications clearly not
Thus,
within this studys scope and publications failing on formal
requirements (such as duplicated papers).
In detail, we
identiﬁed 230 publications (about 90% of all papers) outside
this studys scope: 20 duplicates, 156 papers accordingly
with inclusion/exclusion criteria and other based on abstract
reading. The search process is summarized in Figure 2.

D. Key-wording using Abstracts

Yli-Huumo et al. [14] proposed the key-wording technique
to classify all relevant research papers. We ﬁrst went thought
the abstract of each paper to identify the most
important
keywords and the key contribution. This purpose used to
classify papers under different categories. In some cases where
it was difﬁcult to classify a paper using its abstract, we looked
through its introduction and conclusion. After classifying all
papers, we read the papers and made changes to the classiﬁ-
cation when necessary.

E. Data extraction and mapping process

The bubble plot was designed to collect all the information
needed to address the research questions of this mapping
study. During the process of data extraction, we recorded
major terms to Excel, which helped me to generate categories
and proceed quality analysis. These data items embrace
the main goals of papers. We used both qualitative and
quantitative synthesis methods.

The ﬁnal search process results 28 papers performed at
the beginning of 2017. Their distribution over databases and
percentage from all search results are illustrated in Table
II-B.

III. STUDY RESULTS

This section demonstrates the ﬁndings from those the data
was extracted regarding use cases of Blockchain in manu-

facturing industry, research type and attributes of Blockchain
technology.

Secure transfer of order data. This use case describes
how the production orders can be assigned to an external
manufacturer and securely transmitted between different
systems. It enables mutual interaction between the producer
and the customer [18].

Product data storing. The data can be intercepted during
transmission from the user’s computer to the cloud systems.
In these use cases the focus is on secured storing of products
data in Blockchain.

Fig. 3. Continent wise distribution of studies.

Top Countries and continents
Geographic distribution of the selected primary papers
is shown in Fig. 3. The top continent was Europe with 14
studies being conducted there. Asia was second with 9 studies
followed by America with 5 studies. China and Germany
contributed towards 6 and 3 studies respectively. The rest of
the countries had two or less papers published. It shows, that
Blockchain technology has attracted attention worldwide.

Year Wise Distribution
Figure 4 depicts the distribution of the papers from 2017 to
2019 year. Literature related to Blockchain in manufacturing
industry has increased enormously in the last 2 years. Due to
increasing papers of applying Blockchain in industrial context
it expected to save this trend for next years.

Supply

chain, Process

traceability. Creating

and
distributing of goods can span over multiple locations,
hundreds of stages etc. The use case aims to provide the
ability to trace process in supply chain from procurement of
raw materials to production [19].

Prevention of fraud, Protection of Intellectual Property
(IP). The main point of this use case is to prove of products
origin and intend for prevention of manipulation providing an
indelible and traceable record of changes.

Industrial IoT (IoT), Automation. This use case illustrates
how Blockchain can be used for integration with industrial
IoT in automation context.

Figure 5 shows the amount of publications where each of
use case above is described year wise. This ﬁgure illustrates,
that the most researched topic is supply chain and process
traceability (19 papers). Less researched (5 papers) is the sce-
nario of how could the product data be stored in Blockchain.
All use cases, except ”Secure transfer of order data” show the
trend of increasing interests.

Classiﬁcation of research.
All of the publications in the study were classiﬁed by
considering the following criteria: (1) Use case of Blockchain,
(2) Research facet and (3) Blockchain facet.

B. Research Facet:

In order to answer RQ3, we classiﬁed the publications in
the study under ﬁve dimensions. These dimensions describe
different use cases of Blockchain in manufacturing industry
on the current state of research in the area. The use cases of
Blockchain in industrial manufacturing are follows:

This facet is inspired by [17] classify publications according
to the type of research they contribute. (1) Review paper
summarizes the current state of understanding on a topic.
(2) Conceptual paper addresses a question that cannot be
answered simply by getting more factual
information. (3)
Solution proposal includes an illustration or example of a

solution to a particular problem. (4) Implementation research
provides a prototypical development of a solution. (5) Case
Study provides an up-close, in-depth, and detailed examination
of a subject of study.

C. Blockchain Facet:

To answer the RQ4, this facet classiﬁed the publications
along the Blockchain attributes like framework (Ethereum,
Hyperledger or other frameworks), type of Blockchain (public.
private, permissioned) and focus of research paper on consen-
sus algorithm.

The results of mapping process are summarized in Figure
6 in form of the bubble plot to show the frequencies. This
visualization gives a quick overview of publications for each
category.

IV. ANALYSIS

This section discusses the study results and answers the

research questions that we deﬁned in Section I-A.

RQ1: What are the problems between stakeholders in

manufacturing industry?

inefﬁciencies,

Manufacturing industry is facing security incidents due to
the competition [11], data sharing with third companies [10],
operational
losses and costs [20]. Issue of
limited trust is one of the complications in the industry [5],
[8], [21]. In [22] authors illustrate the dependency of industrial
companies on Trusted-Third-Party (TTP). It caused by the
closed source code of programs, used in manufacturing
is necessary to differentiating
industry [10]. Moreover it
between original part or counterfeit products [23],
[24].
The outsourcing of production orders [13] leads to limited
ﬂexibility and considerable organizational effort.

RQ2: What are the data to secure in manufacturing
process?

For some businesses the data exchange is a key success
factor, so we found several
type of data that should be
protected between stakeholders:

• Computer-Aided Design (CAD) ﬁle for design and tech-

nical documentation [23], [25]
• Material speciﬁcation [25], [26]
• Order details [13] and product recipe [27]
• Machine data [21], [28] (measurement data [11] and

conﬁguration [26])

• Process values [21], [29] and process state [5], [7], [30]
Selection of data, which should be protected, depends on

speciﬁc scenario and application area of Blockchain.
RQ3: What are the use cases of Blockchain technology
for manufacturing industry?

There are various use cases of Blockchain technology
in the industrial manufacturing. In this study we identiﬁed
5 papers (17% of all papers) describing use case ”Secure

transfer of order data” in form of solution proposal. All
of this papers provide prototypical
implementation. Only
4 papers (14% ) are relevant for storing of product data
in distributed ledger. According to our ﬁndings, signiﬁcant
part of papers (around 43%) illustrate solution proposal for
supply chain and process traceability and 9 of them (32%)
demonstrate implementation examples. Fraud prevention and
IP Protection are considered in 2 papers (around 7%) and
both of these papers implement this use case. The last use
case ”IoT, Automation” are described in 5 papers and covers
equally all types of research. The application of Blockchain
is not limited to the use cases above.

RQ4: What Blockchain frameworks are suitable for
the scenario ”Assignment of production orders to an
external manufacturer”?

This scenario is implemented mostly on Ethereum Blockchain
(in 4 of all papers) [12], [13], [25], [28]. In [13] was
illustrated an example of using Hyperledger Fabric and
in [7] was used Multichain. Public Blockchain was used in
2 papers [12], [13],
in 1 research work the authors used
the private Blockchain [25] and in 4 papers was chosen
consortium or permissioned Blockchain [7], [12], [13], [28].
Some papers describe several types of Blockchain in the case
use case. It means, that this use case is possible to implement
based on different Blockchain networks and doesn’t require a
speciﬁc framework.

V. CONCLUSION

In the coming years it is expected, that the manufacturing
sector will beneﬁt from the use of Blockchain technology. In
order to identify opportunities for integration of Blockchain
in industrial processes, this research was made in form of
systematic mapping study. After conducting the SMS and
analysing the literature, a total of 28 primary papers were ex-
tracted from 4 different scientiﬁc databases, published mainly
in journals and conference proceedings and classiﬁed into
different facets. We have covered the time period of 2017-
2019 and have classiﬁed the papers under different dimensions.
We grouped these issues into ﬁve use cases, namely, secure
transfer of order data, product data storing, supply chain and
process traceability, fraud prevention and IP protection, IoT
and automation.

In this study we found that the majority of papers describe
the case ”supply chain and process traceability” as solution
proposal. There are essential less ﬁndings regarding assign-
ment of production orders to an external manufacturer. It
demonstrates the relative lack of research on this scenario,
that requires effort lot more research. As found out, the last
use case can be implemented using different frameworks. For
example, this case could be implemented base on permissioned
Blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric5. However, it is required

5www.hyperledger.org

Fig. 6. Visualisation of a Systematic Map in the Form of a Bubble Plot

to evaluate all frameworks to select the most suitable solution
for the use case.

The result of this mapping study can be applied only on the
selected research databases and may help the researchers to get
an overview of the status of Blockchain in the manufacturing
industry and highlight the research gaps.

Our line of future research aims precisely to implement our
own prototype of use case ”Assignment of production orders
to an external manufacturer” to demonstrate the beneﬁts of
using Blockchain in factory automation. Additionally, we are
going to extend the literature survey to include other databases
like SpringerLink and we will apply snowballing to assure that
the search is as comprehensive as possible.
