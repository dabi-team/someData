Abstract—This paper presents a blockchain-based approach
for securing spectrum sharing in multi-beam satellite systems.
Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that requires highly
efﬁcient management schemes for optimized sharing by network
users. However, spectrum sharing is vulnerable to attacks by
malicious protocol participants. In order to ensure efﬁcient spec-
trum management in the face of dishonest satellite users or cyber
attackers, it is important for spectrum sharing mechanism to
provide transparency and traceability of the trading process so as
to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized
access by malicious users. We address these requirements by
proposing the use of blockchain which, apart from its ability
to provide transparency and traceability, ensures an immutable
means for keeping track of user trading reputation. Besides,
in order to address the practical constraints of heterogeneous
user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to
support users with limited computing power. In this paper, we
propose a blockchain-based spectrum trading framework and,
based on which, a multibeam satellite spectrum sharing algorithm
for interference pricing and heterogeneous spectrum demands
is devised to improve the efﬁciency of satellite spectrum. By
leveraging on the system characteristics of blockchain, a dynamic
spectrum sharing mechanism with traceability, openness and
transparency for whole trading process is presented. Numerical
results are also provided to evaluate the system beneﬁts and
spectrum pricing of the proposed mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE openness and wireless characteristics of satellite

communications make it more vulnerable to security
interference by malicious users. For example, when terrestrial
users share the spectrum with the satellite systems and access
the satellite channel dynamically, the presence of malicious
users will jeopardize any spectrum management effort of the

satellite system. Satellite communications have the character-
istics of long communication distance, high communication
quality and wide coverage, which has become one of the
important means of modern communication [1]-[3]. However,
many of these characteristics also bring security challenges to
communication system.

Due to the importance of security in satellite communica-
tions, a lot research works have been conducted to address
malicious interference and reconnaissance for satellite com-
munications, including space technology based on adaptive
antenna, spectrum expansion technology, on-board processing
and amplitude limiting technology [4]-[6]. In recent years,
with the growing demand of dynamic spectrum sharing and
access in satellite systems, privacy-preservation and security
issues receive much extensive attention of the research com-
munity [7]-[9]. In dynamic spectrum utilization of satellite
communications, security concerns need to be tackled in
spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation and spectrum switching.
Similar to the scenario of dynamic spectrum access and shar-
ing in terrestrial communications, malicious user behavior in
the spectrum sensing process may lead to prolonged allocation
of communication channel. Besides, malicious collusion to
manipulate spectrum pricing distribution may also undermine
the interests of the satellite communication systems.

While improving the efﬁciency of spectrum utilization under
the assumption that all users honestly execute the spectrum
trading protocol, a practical spectrum management system
must also address abnormal situations when there are dishon-
est users. In this case, dishonest users may send malicious
messages to disturb the spectrum trading process in order
to manipulate spectrum prices, hence resulting in inefﬁcient
allocation of the previous satellite spectrum resource. Existing
research work on satellite spectrum sharing security mainly
focuses on the ﬁeld of spectrum sensing [10][11]. The issues of
malicious collusion in the process of spectrum trading, which
damages the interests of satellite systems, and malicious long-
term monopoly in dynamic spectrum access are critical to the
efﬁcient operation of satellite systems and deserve in-depth
investigation. Nevertheless, to date, very little research work
on security and privacy preservation of spectrum pricing and
transaction in satellite systems has been reported. Recently, the
technology of blockchain has attracted growing attention from
researchers in wireless communications to secure network
security [12]-[16]. In [12], the authors proposed a blockchain-
based veriﬁcation protocol
to enable and secure dynamic
spectrum sharing in mobile cognitive radio networks. In [13],
the authors explored the application of blockchain technology

 
 
 
 
 
 
on dynamic spectrum sharing. [14] aims to solve the secu-
rity issue by introducing a novel privacy-preserving dynamic
spectrum trading mechanism on the basis of blockchain-
based method. In [15], a blockchain-based spectrum sharing
mechanism which can efﬁciently share idle spectrum in dense
networks was proposed. In [16], a blockchain-based platform
was raised to improve the spectrum sharing by introducing the
spectral token which validates and tracks the use of a licensed
spectrum to facilitate the dynamic use for secondary users. Yet,
none of the published research work considered blockchain-
based technology as a means for solving the issue of spectrum
trading security in satellite systems.

This paper proposes a blockchain-based approach to secure
spectrum sharing in multibeam satellite systems. We design
a blockchain-based framework, based on which, an efﬁcient
spectrum management scheme which is capable of withstand-
ing malicious participants is developed. By leveraging on the
system characteristics of blockchain, the proposed scheme
provides transparency and traceability of the trading process.
In this article, to secure the satellite spectrum sharing, the
concepts of edge node computing and user trading reputation
are introduced to build the blockchain wherein terrestrial base
station or fusion center acts as the edge node or blockchain
miner who needs to complete mining task, creation of new
block and exchange of spectrum coin. Edge node’s histor-
ical information and transaction record will be gathered to
form the its trading reputation so as to decline the low
computation-power or malicious user’s access. On the basis
of the secure sharing mechanism, a satellite spectrum trading
method is raised by taking into account inter-cell interferences
and satellite users’ stochastic demands on diverse satellite
spectrum to optimize satellite systems’ beneﬁts. Numerical
results are provided to evaluate the spectrum sharing method’s
performances in terms of satellite proﬁts and interference
pricing. The reminder of this paper is as follows: The system
model and framework of blockchain-based spectrum trading
are given in Section II. The joint interference pricing and
power control algorithm is presented in Section III. Then, we
show the simulation part in Section IV. The conclusion of this
article is given in Section V.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SPECTRUM

A. System Model for Multibeam Satellite Communications

In this paper, we consider the spectrum trading is carried
out in multibeam satellite systems in which oblique projection
and spectrum reuse mode are adopted as shown in Fig. 1. In
this case, due to the inter-cell interference caused by spectrum
reuse, we focus the interference pricing and power control
when designing the spectrum sharing scheme.

In speciﬁc, for the effects of oblique projection, the angle
θMn describing the deviation angle between user n and center
point of cell M can be expressed as

the spectrum reuse and inter-cell interference in multibeam
satellite systems are considered. As shown in Fig. 1, we
assume user n at cell M will suffer interference from user
c at cell U where the cells in same color share same spectrum
band. Then, for the uplink channel, the receiving power at the
satellite from user n at cell M can be expressed as

B. Blockchain-Based Satellite Trading Framework

When terrestrial users are allowed to share the spectrum
with satellite systems and access satellite channels dynami-
cally, or transmit the signal with the assistance of satellite
systems, if the users are malicious, the security risk of the
satellite systems will be obviously exposed. In addition, the
malicious buyer, malicious third party and malicious collusion
in the process of spectrum auction will also trigger confusion
to satellite spectrum sharing. How to deal with the malicious
user’s access to satellite spectrum is a key issue to establish
the secure spectrum sharing mechanism in multibeam satellite
systems. This paper plans to make full use of the natural
security attributes of blockchain technology to build a secure
architecture for spectrum sharing in multibeam satellite sys-
tems.

As shown in Fig. 2, the proposed blockchain-based spec-
trum trading architecture involves the following components
and objects: authorization center, spectrum provider, spec-
trum demander, virtual coin and terrestrial base station. The
authorization center initializes the spectrum trading system,
public parameters and cryptographic key. Furthermore, the
center sets up initial standard and rule for the blockchain,
yet does not participate in speciﬁc trading process. In the
proposed architecture, edge nodes, which are the terrestrial
base stations, are introduced to complete mining calculation,
verify the trading users and conduct the spectrum trading. The
scheme also introduces an object called spectrum coin which
is stored in edge nodes for virtual transaction. In the spectrum
trading system, transaction records are saved in each edge node

to ensure transparency and communication security. In this
case, general terrestrial users serve as the spectrum demanders
and satellite system serves as the spectrum provider. Every
terrestrial user which aims to use the satellite spectrum needs
to pay the virtual coin through the edge nodes. Several
signiﬁcant characteristics of this mechanism are as follows.

• Set the edge calculation nodes to solve the calculation
force problem in blockchain creation. Focus on the dis-
tributed scenario of terrestrial networks, as shown in
Figure 2, select the central node or base station in the
local area as the terrestrial agent to communicate with the
satellites. The calculation capability and energy reserve of
the terrestrial agent are relatively sufﬁcient which enable
it to undertake important block creation and mining work.
• The mechanism of miner selection based on the trading
reputation of edge nodes will be established. In order to
prevent malicious and low computation force nodes from
accessing the satellite spectrum, a corresponding reputa-
tion table is built for each potential access node, recording
all the registration, transaction and other historical infor-
mation. The node’s application along with its historical
information and transaction records are distributed to all
authorized nodes for approving. Constantly update and
maintain the reputation table, timely verify the legal block
miner identity of the node, so as to ensure the elimination
of malicious node access.

• Spectrum coin and reasonable mining coefﬁcient are
deﬁned. The transaction between the terrestrial user and
the satellite systems is conducted through the virtual
spectrum currency. Spectrum coin and its transaction
records are saved in given edge node. Meanwhile the edge
node that successfully accesses the blockchain through

mining also receives the incentive of spectrum coin. De-
ﬁne a reasonable mining difﬁculty coefﬁcient, eliminate
the intervention of low computation force nodes, and
maintain a system incentive balance.

The spectrum trading process is as shown in Fig. 3. In this
case, it is assumed that all the traders are rational and selﬁsh
with the intention of pursuing maximal beneﬁts. The spectrum
demander—terrestrial users purchase bandwidth through buy-
ing the spectrum coin for payment. In every edge node, there is
a ballet address in which terrestrial users store the virtual coin
and wait the collection of satellite systems. Both participants’
trading behaviors and data, including time stamp, block data,
block header, signature, etc., will be recorded in the databases
of all the block nodes for tracing and veriﬁcation at any time.
Once a block node has malicious or fraudulent behavior, its
reputation value will be reduced until its trading qualiﬁcation
is terminated.

After the block is authorized to join in the blockchain, to
ensure trading security, all the authorized nodes will obtain
a copy of all
the sharing data of the whole blockchain.
Meanwhile, a distributed consensus mechanism is devised to
efﬁciently attain the blockchain consensus of this spectrum
trading. In our scheme, the miner head is designed to ﬁrstly
broadcast block data, time stamp, speciﬁc random number ϕ
to all the authorized edge nodes for checking. In order to
obtain mutual supervision and veriﬁcation rights, the edge
nodes will detect the block data information and broadcast the
veriﬁcation results with their own watermark. After receiving
all the veriﬁcation feedback, the leader will share all relevant
data, and approve the new miner block to join the blockchain
to complete the increase of the blockchain. At the same time,
if some nodes object to the current block change, the leader
will delay the increase of the blockchain and repeatedly send

updated data to these nodes in subsequent operations to further
reach a consensus.

The core index to judge whether the potential edge node is
qualiﬁed or malicious is the node’s reputation value. In this
case, we deﬁne a reputation model for terrestrial edge nodes.
Consider a spectrum operator Opi waiting for joining in the
spectrum trading and an edge node Edj. In the process of
spectrum trading, the operator and edge node should often
contact with each other. The reputation value of this operator
Opi to its corresponding node Edj can be expressed as wi→j .
We can also have wi→j
:= {T rui→j , U nti→j , Indi→j },
wherein T rui→j, U nti→j, Indi→j falling in [0, 1] denote the
trusted, untrusted and indeﬁnite variables, respectively. There
is T rui→j + U nti→j + Indi→j = 1. The logical model of
node’s reputation can be given as

T rui→j = (1 − Indi→j ) Np
U nti→j = (1 − Indi→j ) Nn
Indi→j = 1 − suci→j,

where Np denotes the positive interaction number, Nn denotes

reputation

where φ is the given probability coefﬁcient and N denotes the

III. JOINT SATELLITE SPECTRUM AND INTERFERENCE
PRICING ALGORITHM

Based on the above blockchain-centric spectrum trading
framework for multibeam satellite systems, then we propose

a speciﬁc spectrum trading algorithm in light of spectrum
and interference pricing. This algorithm is performed by
edge computing nodes whose main tasks involve the col-
lection of interactive information for both traders, designing
rational spectrum pricing strategy and promoting the smooth
implementation of spectrum trading. According to our system
model, the spectrum reuse and inter-cell interference will be
considered. Besides,
the signiﬁcant spectrum heterogeneity
caused by capacity diversity in various beams needs also to
be addressed. As shown in Fig. 1, the terrestrial user c and
n share the same spectrum and interference with each other.
Thus, the utility function of multibeam satellite systems can
be expressed as

Us = Ni(πipcfcs + εBi − κXloss)

s.t.

γn =

pnfns

where Ni denotes the channel number in type i, πi denotes
the interference pricing, pc denotes the transmit power of
terrestrial user c, fcs denotes the channel fading coefﬁcent,
Bi denotes the bandwidth, ε and κ denote the monetary
coefﬁcient, Xloss denotes the marginal cost. g(θ) denotes the
probability density function of the user c with preference
parameter θ.

Then, the utility function of terrestrial user requiring to

access the satellite spectrum can be given as

Uc =ω log2(1 +

s.t.

γc =

pnfns + N0(αc)Bc

) − εBi − πiθpcfcs

(8)

where terrestrial user c and n share the same spectrum band
as shown in Fig. 1, thus leading to inter-cell interference.
γc ≥ γtar means the quality of communication for new user
c should be guaranteed. ω and ε are monetary coefﬁcients
transforming system beneﬁts to uniformed monetary proﬁts
in unit of spectrum coin. N0(αc)Bc denotes the background
noise in this circumstance. The terrestrial user c not only needs
to pay for the spectrum cost, but also the interference pricing.
the optimal spectrum
Solving the above utility functions,
pricing and maximal system proﬁts can be obtained.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, numerical results are provided to evaluate
the performances of the proposed spectrum trading algorithm
in terms of interference pricing and systems’ proﬁts. As shown
in Fig. 3, we give the trend of optimal interference pricing with
changing QoS threshold γtar and leased bandwidth B. In this
test, we set the parameters as ω = 1, κ = 0.5, N0(εMn) =
0.002, fcs = 0.2, fns = 0.1, Ni = 5, N0(αc) = 0.001.
We can obtain from Fig. 4 that the interference pricing will
increase with upgrading QoS threshold γtar which means
better communication requirement is needed. As high inter-
cell interference will lead to the decline of QoS, the satellite
systems require to raise interference pricing to combat with
the interference. In addition, we can achieve from Fig. 4 that
more available satellite spectrum will decrease the interference

In Fig. 5, we give the performances of satellite systems’
proﬁts with changing interference pricing π and monetary
coefﬁcient ω. We can achieve from Fig. 5 that excessive inter-
ference pricing will reduce satellite systems’ proﬁts rather than
enhancing proﬁts, since the terrestrial users’ communication
demands degrade in case of high cost. In addition, as shown
in Fig. 5, higher monetary coefﬁcient can beneﬁt satellite
systems’ proﬁts due to more terrestrial users’ beneﬁts in this
case.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we proposed a blockchain-based spectrum
trading algorithm in multibeam satellite systems to enhance
spectrum efﬁciency while guaranteeing satellite communica-
tion security. The main contribution of this paper lies in that we

demand while guaranteeing the trading security by using
the blockchain technology. To adapt to the speciﬁc satellite
communication circumstances, we introduce the concepts of
edge computing nodes and reputation-oriented node selection
mechanism in process of building the blockchain. Besides,
due to the spectrum reuse in multibeam satellite systems
and heterogeneous transmission in various beams, we take
into account the interference pricing and spectrum demand
diversity when devising the satellite spectrum trading scheme.
Numerical results are also provided to testify the performances
of satellite systems’ beneﬁts and interference pricing with
various key parameter settings.
