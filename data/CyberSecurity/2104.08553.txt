Abstract: The surging usage of electric vehicles (EVs) demand the robust deployment of trustworthy electric vehicle charging 
station (EVCS) with millisecond range latency and massive machine to machine communications where 5G could act. However, 
5G  suffers  from  inherent  protocols,  hardware,  and  software  vulnerabilities  that  seriously  threaten  the  communicating 
entities' cyber-physical security. To overcome these limitations in the EVCS system, this paper analyses the impact of False 
Data Injection (FDI) and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks on the operation of EVCS.  This work is an extension of 
our previously published conference paper about the EVCS. As new features, this paper simulates the FDI attack and the syn 
flood DDoS attacks on 5G enabled remote Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that controls the solar 
photovoltaics (PV) controller, Battery Energy Storage (BES) controller, and EV controller of the EVCS. The attacks make the 
EVCS system oscillate or shift the DC operating point. The frequency of oscillation, its damping, and the system's resiliency 
are found to be related to the attacks' intensity and target controller. Finally, we propose the novel stacked Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM) based intrusion detection systems (IDS) solely based on the electrical fingerprint. This model can detect the 
stealthy cyberattacks that bypass the cyber layer and go unnoticed in the monitoring system with nearly 100% detection 
accuracy.

Introduction                                                                                       

the 
The  communication  and  control  modules  extend 
capability to communicate with diverse stakeholders such as 
EV  users,  operators,  utilities,  credit  card  companies, 
transportation. The key enablers for wireless technology may 
be 5G/6G, Wi-fi 6, Bluetooth, ZigBee [9]. The sensing and 
protection modules ensure the good health and safety status 
of  electrical  components 
the  EVSE.  These  open 
in 
communications  designed  to  provide  robust,  smart,  and 
accurate control push air-gapped EVSE physical systems to 
the  edge  of  cyber-physical  vulnerabilities.  Some  of  the 
vulnerabilities  come  with  the  deficiency  in  communication 
protocols  such  as  authentication,  authorization,  and  access 
control,  some  with  the  inherent  component  vulnerabilities. 
Furthermore, there is always a risk from insider threats and 
socially  engineered  advanced  persistent  threats  from  the 
notorious hackers[10]. 

The  intelligent  and  extensive  deployment  of  electric 
vehicle  supply  equipment  (EVSE)  coerces  heterogeneous 
stakeholders and customers to coordinate and communicate. 
The  heterogeneous  stakeholders  mainly  refer  to  i)  the 
intelligent transportation system (ITS)/vehicle to everything 
(V2X)  infrastructures  such  as  roadside  sensors,  connected 
automated  vehicles  (CAV),  electric  vehicles  (EVs),  ii) 
Electric  grid  infrastructures  such  as  utility,  generation, 
transmission,  distribution,  sensors,  protection  and  relays  so 
on, and iii) financial institution such as credit card companies 
for  the  management  of  transactions  [1].    The  extent  of 
administrative  privilege  for  coordinating  these  eccentric 
stakeholders to/from the EVSE  is still a conflict of interest 
due  to  the  lack  of  clearly  developed  standards  for  proper 
interoperability and a fully matured trustworthy environment 
[2]. Therefore, the EVSE needs robust, secure, and reliable 
communication with its stakeholders and customers. In such 
a scenario, the communication between these multiple nodes 
may  need  stringent  requirements  in  terms  of  latency, 
bandwidth, and the number of connections. 5G must be the 
ideal  communication  tech  for  fulfilling  those  requirements. 
As shown in Fig.1, The most updated deployment scenarios 
of  5G  till  now  are  Industrial  internet  of  things  (IIoT)  and 
ultra-reliable 
(URLLC), 
extended mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type 
communication  (mMTC),  with  additions  of    ITS/V2X, 
Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) and New Radio based 
access to unlicensed spectrum (NR-U) [3]–[7].  

communication 

low-latency 

The general system architecture of EVSE includes the 
power  delivery  modules,  communication  and  control 
modules,  sensing  and  protection  modules,  and  interfaces  to 
users  [8].  The  power  delivery  module  deals  with  the 
unidirectional/bidirectional  flow  of  electric  power  to/from 
EV/grid  such  as  a  battery,  power  supply,  power  regulator.

Cyberattacks'  motivation  in  EVSE  ranges  from  a 
prank, electricity theft, identity theft to vicious ransomware 
and malware that could infect the entire EVSE network [11]. 
The infected EVSE can spread malware to other EVSE via

the 
transformation 
communication/cyber  layer  to  the  physical  infrastructure 
layer are the intricate metrics that should be analyzed in terms 
of the aftermath in the real physical entities such as power, 
current, voltage, and state of charge (SOC). The work in [13] 
enlists the vulnerability analysis and risk assessment of the 
EVSE with details of the potential attack scenario such as a 
DoS, man in the middle (MITM), FDI. The scope of the paper 
will mostly cover DDoS and FDI.  One of the DoS attacks, 
e.g.,  SYN-flood,  originates  from  the  inability  of  transport 
control protocol (TCP) 's three-way handshakes to correctly 
identify  legitimate  requests  from  the  client's  nodes  and 
responding  each  of  them.  Therefore  all  of  the  DoS  attacks 
target  the  network/source  availability  by  processing  the 
illegitimate  requests  assuming  it  as  the  legitimate  users 
causing  the  congestion  [14].  Furthermore  hence,  it  is 
imperative to develop a system that could efficiently identify 
DoS attacks. 

The  proactive  strategy  for  accurate  detection  and 
classification of the EVSE network attacks on time is known 
as  an  intrusion  detection  system  [15].  It  helps  the  operator 
take  protective  and  preventive  measures  once  the  attack  is 
identified.  There  are  three  types  of  IDS  derived  from  their 
implementation 
locations,  namely:  Host-based  (HIDS), 
network-based  (NIDS),  and  hybrid  IDS  [11].  Three  basic 
intrusion detection techniques have been widely deployed in 
state-of-the-art 
applications,  namely:  Signature-based 
detection (SD), Anomaly-based detection (AD), and Stateful 
protocol analysis (SPA) [11] [16].   

Researchers 

listed  and  characterized  exploitable 
backdoors of the EV charging infrastructure; however, they 
lack  the  impact  analysis  of  attacks  and  detection  and 
mitigation  strategies  [17].  Authors  [18]  presented  a  system 
approach  to  list  the  interactions  between  various  cyber-
physical  components  inside  the  smart  EVSE  and  few 
approaches  to  improve  its  cyber-physical  security.  This 
research  work  also  lacks  the  analysis  of  the  impact  on  EV 
charging  and  any  proactive  detection  techniques.  The 
research work [19] introduced the concept of cyber insurance 
that transfers the risk of paying a high price from user to third 
party  in  offline  EV  charging.  Nevertheless,  the  cyber 
insurance  model  lacks  security  analysis.  Likewise,  cyber 
threats targeting different players in an EVSE are presented, 
lacking  impact  analysis  and  mitigation  techniques  [20]. 
Apparently,  most  of  the  research  [17]-[20]  in  EVSE 
cybersecurity  is  limited  to  vulnerability  analysis  and  risk 
assessment;  and  unable  to  explain  the  exact  quantifiable 
effects on the physical system from the cyber-initiated attack. 
The  literature  also  lacks  the  proactive  attack  detection 
strategy  such  as  IDS  [13]  and  post-attack  specifications  to 
deal with the attack in standalone EVSE or fleet. 

remote  centralized  control 

The automation of EVSE operation and management 
requires 
to 
communicate  with  numerous  field  devices  with  the  least 
possible  delay.  Since  5G  is  the  proven  cellular  technology 
with less than 1 ms latency capable of million of machine type 
communication [21], it can be the candidate technology for 
EVSE communication too.  

like  SCADA 

Based  on  the  above  background,  this  paper  steps 
ahead to propose and simulate the 5G enabled PV-powered 
standalone  EVSE  architecture  controlled  by  a  remote 
centralized controller/SCADA. The centralized controller can 

control the entire EVSE station to manage all the controllers, 
namely a PV controller, BES controller, and the EV controller. 
We  developed  the  stealthy  FDI  and  the  SYN-flood  DDoS 
attack strategy, ran the proposed architecture in a simulated 
environment,  and  presented  an  impact  analysis  of  attack 
penetration on EVSE. Moreover, we proposed the novel deep 
learning-based  local  IDS  to  detect  the  attack  at  the 
infrastructure 
the 
network/cyber  layer.  The  local  IDS'  motivation  is  that  a 
stealthy attack may pass through the  IT system and disrupt 
and dismantle the physical infrastructure of EVSE. Therefore, 
the proposed model could detect the bypassed attack by using 
the  fingerprint  of  electrical  parameters.  So,  the  proposed 
model  would  make  the  EVSE  smarter  by  making  it  self-
reliant against cyberattacks.

than 

 The proposed IDS implements the variant of recurrent 
neural  network  (RNN)  called  stacked  or  deep  LSTM 
specifically  designed  to  deal  with  sequential  learning.  The 
motivation for using LSTM came from the sequential nature 
of electrical and control signals and its superior classification 
performance in our past work [11]. Unlike current work, our 
past work solely depended on network packet fingerprint to 
train the deep learning models to detect the cyberattacks at 
the network layer. It can not detect the bypassed attack at the 
infrastructure layer.  

This  research  work  extensively  used  the  NetSim 
standard  version  12.2  for  network  simulation  that  acts  as  a 
bidirectional  communication  link  of  the  remote  SCADA 
managing the PV, BES, and EV controllers at the EVSE. To 
implement  a  testbed  for  the  PV-powered  standalone  EVSE 
architecture  with  BES  and  EV  charging  and  to  assess  the 
impact  of  FDI  and  DDoS  attacks,  MATLAB  2020b  and 
Simulink were used. Also, Python 3.7 was used for stacked 
LSTM based IDS implementation to detect and classify the 
attacks. This work is an extension to our previously published 
conference paper about the EVCS [11]. However, the main 
contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:  

1)  Development  of  a  simulation  model  of  EVSE 
system  including  a  standalone  PV,  BES,  EV 
charger, and associated controllers.

Our proposed EVSE is a standalone, PV-powered, and 
off-the-grid  system.  It  has  three  electrical  units:  PV 
Generation  Unit  (PGU),  Energy  Storage  Unit  (ESU),  and 
Power Delivery Unit (PDU), as shown in Fig. 2.  The PGU 
consist  of  a  PV  array,  a  boost  converter,  and  a  control 
circuitry. The PV arrays deliver 1.065 kW at maximum power 
point (MPP) with the corresponding voltage of 36.75 V and 
and 
current of 29 A at the constant irradiance of 1000 
constant temperature of 25 ℃. The boost converter boosts the

PV voltage (
The ESU consists of BES, a DC-DC converter, and a control 
𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟_𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 
circuitry.  The  BES  has  a  nominal  voltage  of  48  V  and  a 
nominal  discharge  current  of  43.47  A  with  a  100  Ah  rated 
capacity.  The  DC-DC  converter  charges  the  BES  in  buck 
mode while there is a surplus generation and discharges to the 
bus bar in boost mode while the PV can't meet the EV demand. 
The control circuitry continuously senses the battery current

2.3. 5G Architecture 

The  virtualization  of  the  core  network  (CN)    in  5G, 
unlike its predecessor, adds higher flexibility and portability 
for  the  network  resource  management  that  delineates  the 
control  and  user  plane  separation  (CUSP)  with  the  help  of 
Software-defined  network  (SDN)  and  Network  function 
virtualization (NFV) [27]. SDN and NFV complement each 
other  for  simpler  network  control  and  management,  better 
elasticity,  and  eliminating  vendor-specific  solutions  [28]. 
Besides  CN,  SDN,  and  NFV,  management  and  network 
orchestrator (MANO), multi-access edge computing (MEC) 
are  key  enablers  of  5G.  The  physical  infrastructures  layer

embodies storage, computing, and networking infrastructures. 
The virtualized infrastructure has a 5G radio access network 
(RAN), IAB, 5G core network functions (5G CN NF), MEC, 
and data network (DN) with MANO for additional network 
slicing. The ENISA has added security architecture processes 
on  its  December  release  because  these  are  the  prime 
stakeholders  towards  5G  security.  The  added  processes  are 
mobile  network  operators  (MNO),  assurance,  and  vendors. 
The  functional  diagram  of  security  architecture  and  the  in-
depth information of individual components could be found 
here [28].  

3.  Cybersecurity issues in EVSE 

The communication system is the nerves of the EVSE 
that facilitates various operations such as EV scheduling, slot 
allotment, authentication and authorization, charging session 
control, grid integration, and on and on [11]. Therefore, once 
the communication is compromised, the entire EVSE is at the 
risk  of  disruption  and  dismantling.  The  future  grid  is 
envisioned  to  handle  the  bidirectional  power  flow,  and 
blockchain-assisted  peer-to-peer  energy  transactions,  and 
vehicle to everything communication (V2X) [29]. The proper 
communication technology like 5G should moderate this odd 
marriage  of  evolving  technology  and  the  traditional  grid 
infrastructure.  Once  the  critical  infrastructure  is  exposed  to 
the open cyber layer through communication links, It is no 
more secure [19]. The communication vulnerabilities can be 
exploited to get access to the SCADA or EVSE system. 

An  attacker  may  use  social  engineering  such  as 
phishing  and/or  reverse  engineering  to  get  the  legitimate 
SCADA's  or  EV's  credentials.  Then,  the  attacker  can 
impersonate the legitimate SCADA operator or EV owner to 
breach the system security [11].

category that disrupts the availability and quality of service. 
Threats from nefarious activity/abuse are the most prominent 
and damaging threats for both 5G and EVSE infrastructures. 
Some of them are listed below:

Denial  of  service:  The  prime  target  of  DoS  is  to 
disrupt 5G/EVSE service availability. DoS can be triggered 
in  many  ways,  such  as  botnet/DDoS,  flooding  of  network 
components/base stations, jamming/interfering with the radio 
frequency, replay, amplification attacks, etc. 

Malicious  code:  The  injection  of  malicious  code  to 
the  software  environment  detriments  and  affects 
the 
processes,  control  actions,  and  operating  conditions  of  the 
system.  Some  examples  are  viruses,  malware,  rootkits, 
worms, trojans, rogueware, ransomware, and SQL and XSS 
injection attacks.  

Exploitation:  Most  of  the  hardware  and  software 
system has glitches or weaknesses. The attacker can exploit 
vulnerabilities  in  architecture,  design,  and  configuration  of 
the network and software/hardware such as zero-day exploits, 
open API, and edge API exploits.   

Abuse:  Since  5G  based  EVSE  is  a  highly  complex, 
heterogeneous cyber-physical system with poorly developed 
administrative  coordination  and  control,  there  are  immense 
potentials  of  abuse  of  remote  access  to  the  network, 
authentication/authorization, 
leakage, 
virtualization, and even lawful interception.

Besides that, there are always imminent threats from

unauthorized  activities,  identity  theft/spoofing,  signaling 
storms/frauds. 

4.  Cyber-Attack Modelling 

Our  work  has  the  following  assumptions:  to  initiate 
the  DoS  attacks;  hackers  used  the  spoofed  IP  of  legitimate 
EVSE. The channel loss of the 5G network is set to be zero. 
We  have  used  our  dataset  generated  from  the  proposed 
system to test our deep learning algorithms.

between  the  lower  bound  of  0  and  upper  bound  of  1.  The 
reason for choosing PRN is completely heuristic-based as the 
duty  cycle  ranges  within  this  limit.  Similarly,  the  attack 
injection  at  both  BES  and  EV  follows  the  Gaussian 
distribution (G) with respective mean and variance as in eqs.

TCP-SYN flood attack is the type of DDoS Attack that 
exploits  the  vulnerability  of  three-way  handshake  in  TCP 
protocol of machine to machine communication. The attacker 
sends  the  TCP  connection  requests  faster  than  the  targeted 
machine can process, culminating in network saturation [32]. 
As shown in Fig. 7, The Attack can be summarized as follow: 
a) Client EVSE sends TCP packet with SYN flag on using 5G 
network,  b)  SCADA  server  on  receiving  the  SYN  packet 
sends  back  SYN-ACK  packet  to  the  client  EVSE  leaving 
half-open port for up to TCP connection timeout period. c) 
EVSE  acknowledges  the  SYN-ACK  packet  by  sending  an 
ACK  to  the  SCADA  server,  and  the  communication  starts. 
Before  the  half-open  connections  expire,  malicious  EVSE 
either impersonating the legitimate EVSE or spoofing the IP 
sends  myriads  of  SYN  requests  to  create  many  more  half-
open connections [33]. The malicious EVSE never receives 
SYN-ACK in spoofed IP and never sends ACK, coercing the 
SCADA server to wait forever.

           (16) 

It  is  considered  that  the  remote  SCADA  station 
continuously monitors all three control stations through the 
5G. Once the DDoS launched through the 5G core network, 
there would be no signal reaching the EVSE. The duration of 
signal  lost  depends  on  the  communication  delay  of  the  5G 
 at any 
network. The SCADA issues a control signal 
timestamp  i  with  N  being  total  numbers  of  samples.  If  the 
communication  delay  caused  by  a  DDoS  attack  in  5G 
,  then  the  original  control  signal  and  delayed 
network  is

Upon receiving the SYN request, the SCADA server/Target 
acknowledges  the  SYN  request  by  sending  the  SYN-ACK 
packet and hold communication open while waiting for the 
EVSE to acknowledge the open connection. The processing 
time  for  SYN-ACK  is  2000  microseconds  in  ethernet 
physical  out  delays  the  arrival  of  SYN-ACK  at  the  EVSE 
node.  A  rouge  EVSE  node  creates  another  SYN  packet 
exploiting  this  delay.  Over  time,  it  creates  an  SYN  request 
score exhausting all the available server resources resulting 
in a successful SYN flood DoS attack as specified in [34].

Each  stacked  hidden  layer  has  64  LSTM  units.  The 
model  is  compiled  using  the  categorical  cross-entropy  loss 
function and Adam optimizer, which are de facto choices for 
multiclass classification. The model is trained for 20 epochs 
with  a  batch  size  of  1000  samples  that  took  almost  32.91 
minutes. 

The primary goal of the proposed system is to detect the 
different  classes  of  bypassed  cyberattack  on  different 
components  of  EVSE  system  using  only  the  electrical 
fingerprint and making it autonomous against the cyberattack. 

5.1.  Data Set 

We  have  collected  36  features  from  our  EVSE 
architecture at a single timestamp. The features include all the 
electrical  signals,  control  signals  being  used  in  the  running 
EVSE system.  The sampling time of data collection is set at

Fig. 8.  Proposed IDS at EVSE. 

The  proposed  IDS  is  tested  and  validated  with  FDI 
attack on our EVSE architecture. As in Fig.8, the proposed 
IDS  constantly  records  the  logs  of  electrical  and  control 
signals  (fingerprint)  through  the  Data  Acquisition  System. 
Then  the  Data  Wrangling  block  chooses,  processes  and 
fetches  the  features  into  stacked  LSTM  in  the  compatible 
format. First, the output class for each data sample has been 
assigned. That can be done by appending {'0'}, {' 1'}, {'2'}, 
{'3'}, {' 4'} at the end of dataset, i.e., 37th column of each class. 
Now, these strings at the output class have been converted to 
categorical data for classification purposes. The dataset can 
be splitted into two mutually exclusive sets: train (70%) and 
test  (30%)  class.  20%  of  training  data  were  further  splitted 
into validation data. Training data in deep learning is used to 
fit the nonlinear convex curve by using input-output mapping 
based on forward and backward propagation. Validation data 
are  generally  used  for  hyperparameter  and  model  tuning. 
Testing data is used to see the generalization of the trained 
model.  Our  deep  LSTM  model  is  3  layered  with  a  10% 
dropout  between  each  stacked  LSTM  layer,  and  it  has  an 
output layer with four nodes. The deep LSTM architectures 
and parameters are shown in table 2 below.

5.3.  Stacked/Deep LSTM 

The  LSTM  is  the  generalized  state  machine  and de-
the  regression  or 
facto  RNN  primarily  designed  for 
classification of the sequential data, i.e., sequence learning. 
The stacking of these individual LSTM cells into the hidden 
layers forms the Deep LSTM. A single LSTM unit is much 
more complex than a traditional neural unit. It has four gates: 
input  gate, output gate,  forget  gate,  and  cell gate  [35].  The 
LSTM  cell  takes  input  feature

6.  Simulation Procedure 

This  research  work  uses  licensed  NetSim  Standard 
version 12.2 as a discrete event network simulator to simulate 
a  5G  network  through  which  an  EVSE  communicates  with 
SCADA for command and control. 

The network layer uses IPV4 protocol with a user-defined IP 
address,  subnet  mask,  and  default  gateway.  The  physical 
layer  of  UE 
is  equipped  with  configurable  height, 
transmission power, and beamforming gain, respectively, set 
to 1.50 meters, 23 dBm, and 0 dB. The same configuration 
goes UE with rogue EVSE with spoofed IP.  
b)  gNB:  Next-generation  node  B  (gNB)  is  the 5G  wireless 
base station that communicates with UE and 5G core network. 
The gNB height is 10 meters with a transmission power of 40 
dBm. The wireless communication between UE and gNB is 
time  division  duplexing  (TDD)  with  15  kHz  subcarrier 
spacing,  the  outdoor  scenario  of  rural  macro  and  channel 
characteristics  with  no  path  loss.  The  gNB  is  set  to  have  a 
round-robin scheduling type with a UE measurement report 
of 120 milliseconds for the experimentation.  
c)  EPC:  Evolved  packet  core  (EPC)  was  introduced  in  4G 
LTE and had a core network functionality. 
d) SCADA server: This wireless node is the SCADA system 
that continuously gets logs of electrical signals from EVSE 
and  sends  control  commands  to  manage  the  controllers  at 
EVSE. 

This setup is designed for the communication between 
the  EVSE  and  remote  control  station  at  SCADA.  The 
SCADA  continuously  monitors  the  operation  of  EVSE  and 
issues the control commands through the 5G network. These 
experimental  setups  start  with  no  attack  scenario,  i.e.,  a 
normal operating condition of 5G communication link, and 
the number of attackers increases from 0  to 15. The NetSim 
simulation time is set to run for 200 seconds to observe the 
delay.  The  physical  layer  setup  in  Simulink  is  already 
explained in section 2 with greater details. 

7.  Simulation results and discussion 

In this work, the Syn flood attacks are triggered in the 
5G enabled communication link between the SCADA node 
and  the  EVSE  node.  As  evident  from  Table  4,  The 
incremental change in delay with an increase in the number 
of attacks is more vehement. The throughput has been more 
consistent as opposed to latency. The throughput drops up to 
20.94%  compared  to  the  base  throughput.  The  latency  has 
been  increased  significantly  as  the  number  of  attackers 
increases from 0 to 15. The worst scenario of 509.476 ms (0.5 
seconds) delay has been used to visualize the impact on the 
EVSE system.

7.1. Impact analysis of FDI attacks 

 In this case, the simulation runs continuously for 15 
seconds  in  Simulink,  and  attacks  are  launched  at  different 
controllers  within  the  simulation  time.  The  FDI  attack 
analysis  has  been  done  in  two  scenarios  to  quantify  the 
severity.  i)  Attacks  are  launched  on  different  controllers  at 
different  times,  and  ii)  Attacks  are  launched  on  different 
controllers  simultaneously.  The  black  plot  in  Fig.  10 
represents  the  various  electrical  parameters  during  normal 
operation, while the red represents those parameters under the 
FDI attack.

Fig.10. Impacts of FDI attacks launched at PV controller 
from 2-4 seconds, BES controller from 6-8 seconds, and EV 
controller at 10 -12 seconds.  

PV controller attack: The duty cycle attack launched 
from 2 to 4 seconds at PV controller has caused severe ripples 
at  PV  power  generation,  excursing  the  power  level  to  -500 
Watt  as  shown  in  Fig.10a.  The  ripples  at  the  PV  controller 
contribute  to  the  oscillating  voltage  at  the  DC  bus  bar  by 
V as in Fig.10b. Further ahead, the ripples pass on to the 
BES oscillates the current through the range of [-17, +17] A 
± 5 
from the normal operating current of -5 A as in Fig.10 c. At 
the same time, the BES voltage goes down and oscillates, as 
in  fig  Fig.10d.  Similarly,  these  low-frequency  oscillations 
have  a  severe  impact  on  the  EV  battery  as  the  charging 
current has steep spikes and dips ranges from -31 A to -13 A 
within  105  ms  as  in  Fig.10e.  Fig.10f  shows  the  slight 
oscillations at voltage during the attack. Therefore, the FDI 
attack  at  the  PV  controller  can  destabilize  the  entire  EVSE 
ecosystem, i.e., PGU, ESU, and a plugged-in EV. However, 
the system gains its normal operating conditions as the attack 
goes off at t=4 seconds.  

BES  controller  attack:  The  FDI  attack  at  the  BES 
controller does not seem to have any significant impact as the 
finely tuned PI controller saturates the incoming fluctuation 
from t=6-8 seconds in Fig.10e. 

EV controller attack: The EV controller attack starts 
at  t=10  seconds  and  lasts  for  2  seconds,  as  in  Fig.10.  This 
impact  is  irreversible  and  does  not  affect  PGU,  except  it 

increases  the  bus  voltage  by  2V  (Fig.10b).  The  attack  has 
risen sharply the constant charging current at BES by 11 A 
(Fig.10c)  with  a  slight  DC  shift  of  117  mv  (Fig.10.d).  The 
attack at EV has shifted constant charging battery current at -
21 A to 0.268 µA (Fig.10e) assisted by slight voltage drop 
(Fig.10f), 
to  stop  charging 
completely.

Fig.11.  Impacts of FDI attacks launched at all controllers 
simultaneously from 2-4 seconds. 

In 

this  case,  all 

the  controllers  are  attacked 
simultaneously  from  2  to  4  seconds  as  in  Fig.11.  The 
integrated  attacks  resulted  in  reversible  low-frequency 
oscillations throughout the attack and irreversible DC shift. 
The  magnitude  and  frequency  of  oscillation  at  power 
generation remain the same Fig.11a. The DC bus voltage has 
spikes of equal magnitude and shifted up by 2V, as shown in 
Fig.11b as opposed to the standalone attack at PV control. 

The variation of BES current ranges from [ -25 A 8.5 
A] from normal constant charging of -5.6 A. It signifies the 
frequent charging and discharging of BES within a short time 
span. The peaks are even, and the constant charging current 
has been increased by 300% even after the attack that never 
comes back to normal mode, as shown in Fig.11c. The BES 
voltage oscillations are the same as the standalone attack at 
PV except for an irreversible DC shift of 117 mV, as shown 
in Fig.11d.  

The EV charging current has been found to be dropped 
to zero permanently from -22 A with slight oscillation around 
0-2  seconds,  as  shown  in  Fig.11e.  That  means  the  EV  has 
stopped  charging.  The  minimal  temporary  oscillation  has 
been observed in EV battery voltage with a slight irreversible 
drop shown in Fig.11f.   

 7.2. Impact analysis of DDoS attack 

Under  similar  simulation  setups  as  the  FDI  attack, 
different delays resulted from a cyberattack on 5G in NetSim 
has  been  tested  in  our  EVSE  system.  Likewise,  the  DDoS 
attack  is  carried  out  in  all  three  control  components 
simultaneously  and  at  different  times.  Fig.  12  presents  the 
impact of DDoS attacks on the physical system caused by the 
500 ms delay of the 5G communication system.  

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  attacker  launches  the  DDoS  attack  on  the  PV 
controller  at  t=2  seconds  and  lasts  for  500  ms.  This  attack 
causes  high-frequency  oscillations  at  power  signal  that 
fluctuates  between  -3.6  kW  to  1.277  kW,  while  the  PV 
generation  system  was  designed  to  deliver  1.065  kW,  as 
shown  in  Fig.12a.  The  negative  power  means  the  PV  is 
drawing  the  power  from  the  EVSE.  Similarly,  these  high-
frequency  oscillation  causes  momentary  voltage  swing  and 
drop  of  2V  at  DC  bus  as  shown  in  Fig.12b.  At  BES,  the 
current surges by 17 A as shown in Fig.12c, and voltage drops 
by 200 mV as shown in Fig.12d.

Fig.12.  Impacts of DDoS attacks launched at PV controller 
from 2-2.5 seconds, BES controller from 6-6.5 seconds, and 
EV controller at 10 -10.5 seconds.  

Similarly, spikes of -10 A and -26 A were observed at 
the beginning and end of the attack respectively in charging 
current  as  shown  in  Fig.13e    and  is  accompanied  by  small 
complementary  voltage  surges  in  EV  battery  as  shown  in 
Fig.13f. As soon as the attack stops, the system completely 
comes back.  

The attacks at BES control and EV controller have no 
impact on system response. This is because the PI controller 
has fixed upper and lower saturation thresholds that do not let 
 signal  to  produce  zero  control  signal, 
the  manipulated 
though  the  signal  is  completely  lost  throughout  the  attack. 
Our  experiment  suggests  that  the  improperly  tuned  PI 
controller  with  no  saturation  thresholds  is  found  to  be 
exploited by the DDoS attack.

7.3. IDS performance analysis 
The deep learning algorithms are created in Python 3.7.4 
in  the  Jupyter  lab  (version  1.1.4)  under  the  free  and  open-
source Anaconda distribution. Intel® Core™ i7-9750 @ 2.60 
GHz processor with 16.00 GB RAM and 64 -bit Windows 10 
OS is used. 

Fig.13  represents  the  accuracy  and  loss  progression 
during the training and validation of the model. The proposed 
model achieves more than 99.9999% accuracy within the fifth 
epochs  for  both  training  and  validation  data.  The  loss  is 
diminished to 6.11e-06 within fifth epochs for both training 
the  smoother 
and  validation  datasets.  This  signifies 
progression  during  the  training,  and  our  model  is  ready  to 
classify the previously unseen datasets of the attack. 

≅ 25%

The classifier's testing or generalization performance 
can be better presented with the confusion matrix, as shown 
in Fig.14. The distribution of test data among different kinds 
of attacks is almost equiproportional, i.e.,  
 from each 
class. The y-axis represents the predicted class, and the x-axis 
represents the actual class. The numbers and % in each cell 
represent the number of samples and % of samples belonging 
to  that  cell.  For  instance,  for  the  first  cell,  among  449,234  
normal  samples  fetched  to  our  model.  It  correctly  predicts 
449,232  sample 
leaving  only  one  sample 
misclassified as PV attack and  another sample misclassified 
as BES Attack, which is almost 100% classification accuracy. 
Each row in the last column represents the total number of 
samples fetched to the classifier. Each column of the last row 
sums up the total number of classified samples belonging to 
different  classes.  Our  classifier  detects    PV  Attack,  BES 
Attack,  EV  Attack  with  100%  accuracy  while  detecting 
normal data with 99.99999% accuracy.

As  per  table  5  below,  the  proposed  classifier  has 
almost  100%  precision  implying  the  model's  repeatability; 
100%  recall  implying  capability  to  correctly  classify  attack 
among  different  classes  of  attack;  and  100  %  f1-score 
indicating superior sensitivity and separability of the model.

All  the  proposed  IDS  performance  metrics  are  found  to  be 
superior compared to our past IDS [11]. 

The most important capability of our proposed IDS is 
that it can detect the attempt of attack that bypasses the cyber 
layer and is not noticed in the monitoring station. For instance, 
the FDI attack at BES from 6-8 seconds, as shown in Fig 11, 
does not seem to change any electrical parameters, though the 
attack is there. But our IDS can detect it with 100% precision, 
recall, and f1-score does not even misclassify a single sample. 
It's because of including the control signals as features.

 Conclusion 

This work analyzes the cybersecurity issues in the 5G 
enabled  EVSE  system  with  a  deep  learning-based  attack 
detection  method.  The  5G  enabled  standalone  off-the-grid 
PV-powered EVSE architecture has been built and simulated 
to  charge  the  PEV.  The  FDI  and  DDoS  attacks  have  been 
successfully  launched  and  simulated  in  the  5G-powered 
EVSE communicating with remote SCADA, and consequent 
impact  analysis  has  been  presented.  Finally,  the  stacked 
LSTM based local IDS has been developed and tested on the 
proposed EVSE solely based on electrical fingerprints. The 
following conclusions can be drawn from the study: 

1)  The 

low-frequency  FDI  attack  on 

the  PV 
controller's  duty  cycle  produces  ripples  and 
impacts 
components 
throughout the attack. 

subsequent 

the 

all 

2)  The FDI attack at BES has no visible impact since 
the  PI  controller  operates  around  the  saturation 
region to cope with the attack. 

3)  The FDI attack at the EV controller has resulted 
in  an  irreversible  DC  shift  in  operating  current 
and voltage. 

4)  The  simultaneous  FDI  attacks  at  all  controllers 

have the integrated impact of points 1, 2, and 3. 

5)  The DDoS attack at the PV controller has caused 
at  PV  power 
high-frequency  oscillations 
generation and high magnitude spikes and dips to 
subsequent  Bus,  BES,  and  EV  controllers 
throughout the attack. 

6)  The DDoS attack at EV and BES has no impact 

due to PI controller saturation. 

7)  The proposed Stacked LSTM based IDS has been 
tested effective and can detect the bypassed cyber 
attack  as  well  as  unnoticed  stealthy  cyberattack 
attempts. 

This novel application could safeguard the EVCS and 
its  stakeholders  from  possible  cyber  threats.  Adding  new 
kinds  of  attack  data  in  training,  the  proposed  model  could 
easily scale up to detect more diverse attacks. It ensures the 
scalability and interoperability of our model. 

Our  future  research  direction  incldes  building  the 
independent,  self-reliant,  agile,  trustworthy  and  resilient 
EVSE  integrated  with  transportation  and  grid  system. 
Moreover,  the  focus  should  be  on  developing  the  control 
algorithms to minimize the attack impact on the EVSE system.
