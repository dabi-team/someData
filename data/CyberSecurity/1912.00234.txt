the  authors  propose  a  way  to  model  the  most  frequent

fuzzy approach for generating attacker profiles based on 
attacker  attributes  such  as  knowledge,

obtained  by  using  another  fuzzy  inference  system  that 
analyzes  the  attacker  profile  and  system  intrinsic

 INTRODUCTION 

Control  systems  are  very  complex 

technical 
structures  composed  not  only  by  sensors,  classical 
controllers  and  actuators,  but  also  integrating  devices 
with  significant  processing  power  and  networking 
capabilities.  

Nowadays  each

interconnected on industrial networks at the plant level 
and connected to the Internet for remote operation and 
monitoring.  These systems are frequently the target of 
various cyber attacks conducted by malicious persons 
from script kiddies and disgruntled employees to cyber 
terrorists  and  industrial  spies.  Since  many  of  these 
industrial  systems  are  components  of  national  critical 
infrastructure,  their  security  is  a  big  challenge  for 
industry, government and academia. 

The  authors  model  the  attacker  profiles  and 
estimate 
the  attack  success  rate  using  a  fuzzy 
approach.  Before  defining  the  fuzzy  inference  rules, 
we have to clarify some concepts related to control.  

components.  Threats  are  hard  to  characterize,  since 
they  have  a  high  indetermination  degree  and  can  not 
be  prevented.  On  the  other  side  vulnerabilities  are 
breaches  which  can  be  exploited  by  a 
threat. 
Vulnerabilities  can  be  detected  and  controlled,  the 
system administrator being able to protect the system 
against known issues [2]. 

The  threats  analyzed  in  this  paper  are  attackers. 
Each attacker has a set of attributes such as knowledge 
of the target system, technical resources, motivation to 
conduct  an  attack  against  the  system.  All  these 
characteristics  allowed  us  to  make  some  attacker 
profiles,  as  presented  in  [1]  and  in  Section  III  of  this 
paper. 

In the next sections the authors provide a detailed 
methodology  for  modelling  the  attacker  profiles  and 
for estimating the attack success rate by using a fuzzy 
inference approach.

II.  FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEMS 
(FIS)  are  an 
inference  systems 
appropriate  solution  to  describe  into  a  linguistic 
manner  the  behavior  of  a  process  [3].  The  process 
behavior  is  usually  described  by  a  mathematical  or 
linguistic  model.  The  FIS  approach  is  more  suitable 
than  conventional  modelling  methods  in  the  case  of 
nonlinear  processes,  if  information  about  process 
nonlinearities is available [4].  

The  architecture  of  a  general  fuzzy  inference 
system is presented in the figure 1. A fuzzy inference 
system is formed by 5 functional units: 

-  the  fuzzification  unit:  at  this  phase  (the  premise 
stage) the crisp value of the input is transformed into a 
set  of  matching  degrees  to  membership  functions 
describing the fuzzified input; 

-  the  defuzzification  unit:  at  this  phase  (the 
consequence  stage)  the  fuzzy  set  resulted  from  rule 
inference mechanism is transformed into a crisp value; 

- the database unit: the storage unit for membership 
functions  parameters  for  both  input  and  output  fuzzy 
variables (model’s tuning parameters); 

Identification  of  threats  and  vulnerabilities  is 
needed,  when  analyzing  the  control  systems  security

 The  mathematical  modelling  of 

the  process 
behavior  usually  begins  with  finding  the  proper 
membership  functions  for  input  and  output  variables 
(first  set  of  tuning  parameters  of  the  model  –  the 
proper  shape  for  membership  functions:  triangular, 
bell  shaped,  Gaussian,  trapezoidal  et  al.).  After 
choosing  the  proper  shape,  the  tuning  parameters  for 
chosen membership functions are found using trial and 
error  methods  (second  tuning  parameters  of  the 
model). This phase is followed by the construction of 
the fuzzy rules (M or TS type). The IF-THEN rules are 
the result of observations and experience of an expert 
in  process  field.  The  last  phase  is  applying  the 
operations  of  inference  to  the  fuzzy  rules  and  then 
establishing  the  crisp  output  value  and  the  modelling 
result. 

In  the  following  sections  is  proposed  a  fuzzy 
approach  on  modelling  the  cyber  attacks  patterns  on 
industrial control systems. In authors opinion the cyber 
attacks  can  be  described  with  attributes  such  as 
attacker  profile,  protection  degree  of  attacked  unit, 
system  vulnerabilities  and  restore  costs  (impact 
factor). 

III.  MODELLING THE ATTACKER PROFILE 
The cyber attacks that happen in industrial control 
systems are conducted by different types of attackers. 
The  “perpetrators”  go  from  un-skilled  “script  kiddie” 
to experts “cyber warrior”.  

The  authors  experience  suggests  that  an  attacker 
profile  can  be  associated  to  an  attacker  score, 
indicating  the  ability  of  an  attacker  to  successfully 
conduct an attack.  

Each attacker can be characterized by at least three 
parameters:  knowledge, 
resources  and 
motivation [1]. These parameters are presented in the 
following paragraphs. 

technical 

Knowledge  is  an  intrinsic  attacker  characteristic, 
that  indicates  his  technical  skills  that  can  be  used  to 
initiate and conduct an attack. Also this parameter can 
show  the  awareness  on  the  target  system  architecture 
and  the  existent  countermeasures.  A  script  kiddie,  an 
Internet  user  that  finds  an  exploit  and  tries  to  use  it, 
has  a  very  low  knowledge  on  the  target  system; 
meanwhile an industrial spy or a disgruntled employee 
the  system  specifications,  security 
is  aware  of 
measures  and  has  much  more  chances  to  exploit  a 
specific vulnerability than the common Internet user. 

Technical  resources  parameter  is  an  attacker 
profile  attribute  that  indicates  the  hardware  and 

Motivation  is  an  intrinsic  attacker  attribute  that 
indicate the determination to conduct an attack on the 
system.  Motivation 
is  given  by  financial  win, 
reputation, revenge.  This parameter is hard to quantify 
and is very dynamic. 

  These  are  the  three  inputs  for  the  proposed  FIS. 
The  output  is  the  attacker  profile  score.  If  three 
membership functions are used as granularity of model 
description for each input, it results in 27 fuzzy rules 
that describe attacker’s profile. Increasing the number 
of  membership  functions  (MF)  for  each 
input 
generates  a  significant  growth  of  fuzzy  rules  number 
(MF number of inputs), with little consequence on the 
quality of the model versus computational effort. This 
is  the  consequence  of  the  importance  in  fuzzy 
modelling  of 
the  completeness,  continuity  and 
consistency  of  fuzzy  rule  base.  In  Table  1  are 
presented  the  most  important  features  of  proposed 
membership  functions  (trimf-triangular, 
trapmf  - 
trapezoidal) for proposed inputs. 

The  output 

is  described  by  5

membership functions as depicted in figure 2.

The  shapes  and  parameters  for  membership

authors experience in fuzzy modeling. The experience 
in attacker behavior is described by the 27 fuzzy rules 
(Mamdani type).

Attacker  profiles  can  be  generated  by  various 
combinations of the three parameters presented in the 
previous paragraphs. Each combination is possible, but 
in  the  literature  and  taking  into  account  the  authors 
experience  we  can  define  some  well-established 
profiles:

- 

Script  kiddie 
is  an  unexperienced  and 
unskilled attacker that found a security exploit 
and tries to use it in order to obtain reputation. 
This  type  of  attacker  has  rarely  success  in 
targeting  protected  systems,  even  if  they 
initiate the majority of attacks. 

impact of determining the attacker score is associated 
to knowledge, followed by resources and motivation. 

For example, if motivation is medium, the attacker 
scores depend on resources and knowledge as in figure 
3.

attacks 
in  his 
community.  He  may  have  good  technical

about the target system architecture. 

reputation 

-  Disgruntled employee has a very high level of 
knowledge about the system. May initiate very 
dangerous  attacks  from  the  interior  of  the 
industrial  network.  His  motivation  is  medium 
and decreases over time. The main scope is to 
revenge against the employee. 

-  Terrorists  are  now  employing  skilled  people 
with  a  decent  resources  level  available.  They 
can  work  as  individuals  or  as  organized 
groups.  Their  motivation  is  for  financial  gain 
and  for  spreading  terror  and  clutter  in  the 
society.  They  are  targeting  mainly  critical

IV.  MODELLING THE ATTACK SUCCESS RATE 
After  modeling  the  attacker  profile,  the  authors 

propose a fuzzy model for the attack success rate.  

We define the attack success rate as the ability of 
the  attacker  to  interrupt  the  functioning  of  the  target 
system.  This  rate  is  mostly  influenced  by  four 
parameters:  the  attacker  profile  score  previously 
established,  the  system  protection  level,  the  system 
vulnerabilities and the restore cost.  

The  system  protection  level  is  an  intrinsic  system 
characteristic related to the number and the quality of 
countermeasures taken in order to secure the system.   

The  system  vulnerabilities  indicator  shows  the 
level  of  the  known  vulnerabilities  that  are  not 
mitigated by the countermeasures already taken. 

The  restore  cost  is  an  important  factor  that 
indicates  both  the  time  and  the  financial  resources 
needed  to  re-establish  the  correct  system  functioning 
in case of an attack. 

The  proposed  inputs  parameters  are  presented  in

The  rules  are  constructed  according  to  authors’ 
experience.  For  example,  rule  27  represents  a  less 
likely to happen attack, upon a highly protected target 
with  big  restore  costs  by  an  unskilled  attacker  so  the 
success rate is small. Rule 60 specify a very successful 
attack  run  by  an  expert  attacker  with  major  impact, 
due to big restore costs. 

The  success  rate  is  directly  proportional  with 
attacker’s  profile  score  and  the  restore  cost  and 
decreases  with  the  protection  degree,  as  presented  in 
figure 14. 

The relation between system protection degree and 
attack success rate, for some attacker profiles or attack 
scenarios will be discussed in a future work.

system protection level, the system vulnerabilities and 
the restore cost. It shows clearly that the success rate is 
directly  proportional  with  attacker’s  profile  score  and 
the  restore  cost  and  decreases  with  the  protection 
degree. 

Further  research  should  be  done  in  estimating  the 
security  risks  associated  of  a  specific  control  system 
tacking into account the attacker profile score and the 
attack success rate defined in this paper. There is also 
needed a context-aware approach of security, that take 
into  consideration  the  changes  in  time  of  motivation 
and  vulnerabilities  in  order  to  implement  dynamic 
countermeasures  in  control  system,  without  affecting 
their performances and objectives.

V.  CONCLUSIONS 
The  control  systems  security  is  a  challenging 
research  topic.  Modelling  and  estimating  the  attacker 
types  and  attack  success  rate  is  a  concern  of  the 
academic and industrial communities. In this paper the 
authors use a fuzzy inference approach to introduce a 
new concept – the attacker profile score.  

This score indicate how skilled is an attacker based 
on three attributes: knowledge, technical resources and 
motivation.  Taking  into  account  the  authors  practical 
experience  in  the  security  field  and  the  data  from 
literature some well-established attacker profiles were 
analyzed. 

In  the  last  part  of  the  paper  a  fuzzy  inference 
system  for  assessing  the  attack  success  rate  is 
presented.  This rate is influenced by four parameters: 
the  attacker  profile  score  previously  established,  the
