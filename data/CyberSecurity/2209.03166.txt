Abstract—Image spam threat detection has continually been 
a  popular  area  of  research  with  the  internet's  phenomenal 
expansion. This research presents an explainable framework for 
detecting  spam  images  using  Convolutional  Neural  Network 
(CNN) algorithms and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) 
algorithms. In this work, we use  CNN model to classify image 
spam respectively whereas the post-hoc XAI methods including 
Local  Interpretable  Model  Agnostic  Explanation  (LIME)  and 
Shapley  Additive  Explanations  (SHAP)  were  deployed  to 
provide explanations for the decisions that the black-box CNN 
models  made  about  spam  image  detection.  We  train  and  then 
evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a 6636 
image  dataset  including  spam  images  and  normal  images 
collected from three different publicly available email corpora. 
The  experimental  results  show  that  the  proposed  framework 
achieved  satisfactory  detection  results  in  terms  of  different 
performance  metrics  whereas  the  model-independent  XAI 
algorithms  could  provide  explanations  for  the  decisions  of 
different models which could be utilized for comparison for the 
future study.

I.  INTRODUCTION

Email is now the formal communication type that is used 
the  most  frequently  by  the  vast  majority  of  internet  users. 
Spam email, has, however, grown to be a significant issue for 
cyber security in recent years due to the increased use of email 
in 
general 
communication [1]. While over 306.4 billion emails were sent 
and  received  per  day  in  2021,  spam  email  communications 
made up nearly half of all email traffic [2]. Although there are 
several mechanisms passively filtering these spam emails in 
the mailbox to stop them, attackers continue to use numerous 
strategies  to  evade  these  anti-spam  systems.  For  instance, 
image spam has been widely utilized by attackers to evade the 
detection of text-based spam filtering systems. Furthermore, 
compared  to  text-based  spam,  image  spam  contains  more 
complicated 
is  more 
suspicious 
damageable for users [3].

Although Machine Learning (ML) based spam detectors 
deploying ML algorithms including Support Vector Machines 
(SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), etc achieved

great  performance  for  filtering  text-based  email  spam  [4], 
image  spam  could  show  text  content  primarily  as  an  image 
shown  in  Fig.  1.  Besides  the  modifying  techniques  such  as 
utilizing  various  colors,  altering  letter  size,  and  introducing 
speckles, spam images may contain illustrations in addition to 
text as well. 

Conventionally, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) [5] 
was utilized by anti-spam systems to extract and recognize the 
words  embedded  in  the  image  spam  and  transform  these 
images into texts. Traditional text-based spam detectors could 
be deployed to detect the image spam processed by the OCR 
mechanisms. Nevertheless, most OCR techniques are prone to 
errors whereas the image’s quality has a big impact on how 
well the OCR techniques perform [6]. On the other hand, spam 
attackers  improved  their  strategies,  such  as  changing  the 
background and foreground colors, text font styles, and image 
rotation, to circumvent the OCR-based image spam detection 
mechanisms. 

In  [7],  the  authors  utilized  OCR-based  systems  to 
recognize the inserted Chinese text in the image spam, then a 
text-based  classifier  could  be  used  to  distinguish  between 
spam and ham emails. Moreover, to address the inadequacies 
of  the  OCR  techniques,  a  keyword  reconstruction  approach 
based on Word Activation Force (WAF) model is presented in 
this paper. And the experimental outcomes on an individual 
dataset of image spam (which is publicly accessible) confirm

the  proposed 

On the other hand, to counter the drawback of the OCR-
based Machine Learning text spam detectors, Deep Learning 
techniques  including  CNN  were  introduced  to  address  the 
issue  of  image  spam  detection  as  well.  In  [8],  Sriram  et  al. 
utilized 3 different datasets to train 2 CNN models as well as 
a  few  pre-trained  ImageNet  architectures  including  VGG19 
and Xception. To address data imbalance, the impact of using 
a cost-sensitive learning strategy was investigated in this study 
as  well.  In  the  best  situation,  some  of  the  models  that  are 
suggested  achieved  accuracy  levels  of  up  to  99%.  In  [9],  a 
dataset  with  810  normal  images  and  928  spam  images  was 
utilized to build a CNN-based spam detection system and an 
accuracy of over 90% was achieved. In this work, the manual 
feature extraction task was avoided so that the time and effort 
for processing the images was decreased compared with other 
conventional image processing techniques. 

However,  while  there  have  been  studies  using  deep 
learning approaches to detect image spam, very few research 
focus  on  the  trustworthiness  and  explainability  of  deep 
learning-based image spam detectors. On the other hand, due 
to the black-box nature of deep learning algorithms such as 
CNN, XAI has been widely utilized in other domains of image 
classification  tasks  including  explainable  medical  image 
classification  [10],  face  recognition[11],  and  autonomous 
driving system [12]. To increase the transparency of the deep 
learning approaches and provide the user confidence about the 
system decision, especially in sensitive areas such as medical 
diagnosis  and  cyber  security,  different  methods  have  been 
deployed  to  visualize,  interpret  and  explain  deep  learning 
models.

Other  than  that,  XAI  approaches  were  utilized  in  other 
cyber  security  tasks  such  as  intrusion  detection  as  well.

to  provide 

Therefore, to bridge this gap of introducing explainability 
to image spam detection, the main contributions proposed in 
this paper are listed as follows: 

(1)  Proposing  an  explainable  image  spam  detection 
framework  using  CNN  models  and  XAI  algorithms 
LIME and SHAP. 

(2)  Introducing explainability for the decisions made by 
the  black-box  CNN  models  to  make  the  spam 
detection process more transparent to users. 

(3)  Comparing  and  investigating  the  explainable  results 
of  image  spam  samples  that  were  not  detected 
accurately to provide information for future studies. 

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
introduces  the  proposed  explainable  framework  for  the 
detection  of  image  spam  using  CNN  models.  Section  III 
provides  experimentation  results  and  analysis  in  terms  of 
conventional  performance  metrics  as  well  as  explainability. 
Section  IV  concludes  this  paper  and  provides  prospects  for 
future work. 

II.  METHODOLOGY 

In this section, the methods including the pre-processing, 
CNN  model,  Local 
Interpretable  Model-Agnostic 
Explanations  (LIME),  and  Shapley  Additive  Explanations 
(SHAP)  are  introduced  to  build  the  XAI-empowered  image 
spam  detection  framework.  An  overview  of  the  proposed 
architecture is shown in Fig. 2 and the different stages of the 
XAI-based  image  spam  detector  are  described  in  the 
subsections respectively. 

A.  Pre-processing 

The first step of the proposed method is the pre-processing 
of the spam images. In this work, we utilized three spam image 
datasets and split the datasets into the training set and testing 
set.  However,  there  are  numerous  duplicate  images  and 
corrupted  images  in  the  datasets  deployed.  Other  than  that, 

 
there is no standard format for the images in the dataset. Some 
images are JPG types whereas some images are PNG or GIF 
types.  Therefore,  we  omitted  the  duplicate  and  corrupted 
images  first  and  then  transformed  all  images  into  the  JPG 
types. 

B.  The CNN model 

In  this  study,  a  CNN  model  is  designed  for  the 
classification  of  the  image  parts  of  spam  e-mails.  For  the 
hyperparameters  used  in  the  proposed  CNN  model,  the 
learning  rate  is  set  to  be  0.0001,  the  optimizer  algorithm  is 
chosen as RMSprop, the epoch is set to be 30, and the batch 
size is 20. 

Fig. 3. CNN model utilized in this work 

As shown in Fig. 3, before being fed into the CNN model, 
the image files are decoded from JPG content to RGB grids of 
pixels  256  ×  256  and  converted  into  floating-point  tensors 
after  that.  Then,  the  pixel  values  between  0  and  255  are 
rescaled to [0,1], and the input shape is transformed into (128 
×  128  ×3).  The  derived  CNN  model  has  4  convolution 
layers of filter sizes 32, 64, 128, and 128 respectively. And 
every convolutional layer is followed by a Max Pooling layer 
with pooling size 2 and the activation function ReLU. Finally, 
using a sigmoid activation function, a dense layer of a single 
neuron is utilized. The detailed structure of the CNN model is 
represented with layer details in Table I.

C.  LIME explanation model 

LIME  stands  for  Local  Interpretable  Model-agnostic 
Explanations  proposed  by  Marco  et  al.  in  [14],  Finding  an 
interpretable model over the interpretable representation that 
is locally faithful to the classifier and intelligible to humans is 
the core objective of the LIME algorithm.  

Define  the  explanation  model  as

group of interpretable models that can be displayed to a user

represent the proximity between the instance z and x to define 
, 
the locality around x. Then define an objective function 

π𝑥𝑥(𝑧𝑧)

𝑔𝑔  ∈ 𝐺𝐺

ξ(x)

and the L-function in 
the  infidelity 

 serves as a metric describing how 
 approximates  f  (complex  model)  through 
 in the local definition. And the L-function is minimized 
to obtain the optimal solution of the objective function when 
π𝑥𝑥(𝑧𝑧)
 (the explanatory model complexity) is low enough to be 
understood  by  humans.  The  explanation  function 
Ω(g)
produced by the LIME algorithm is as follows:

ξ(x)   =   arg  𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑔𝑔 ∈𝐺𝐺  𝐿𝐿�𝑓𝑓, 𝑔𝑔, π𝑥𝑥(𝑧𝑧)�   +  Ω(g)

the following form in equation 3. Where 
 is the predicted 
value  of  the  perturbed  sample,  on  the  d-dimensional  space 
(original  features),  and  takes  that  predicted  value  as  the 
answer, and 
 is the predicted value on the d'-dimensional 
space (interpretable features), and then uses the similarity as 
g(z′)
the  weight,  so  the  above  objective  function  can  then  be 
optimized by linear regression.

Known as a unifying framework for the interpretation of 
the  black-box  models,  SHAP,  which  stands  for  Shapley 
Additive exPlanations, was introduced by Scott et al. in [15]. 
The goal of SHAP is to explain the prediction of instance x by 
calculating the contribution of each feature to the prediction x. 
The SHAP explanation method calculates the Shapley value 
based  on  coalition  game  theory.  The  feature  values  of  data 
instances act as participants in the coalition (set). The Shapley 
values tell us how to fairly distribute the "expenditures" (i.e., 
predictions)  among  the  features.  A  player  can  be  a  single 
feature value, for example, for tabular data. A player can also 
be a set of feature values. SHAP specifies the interpretation as 
the following equation:

III.  EXPERIMENT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 

This  paper  simulated  the  performance  of  the  models 
proposed in Section II in the environment of Python 3.8. The 
experiment is carried out in the operating system of Windows 
10, 4 cores CPU, 8.00 GB RAM, and 4G GPU. 

A.  Data Set 

To  train  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  proposed 
XAI-based  CNN  image  spam  email  detection  models,  this 
paper implements four publicly available image email datasets 
for the experiments, including image spam and normal images 
respectively. Many anonymous individuals contributed to the 
construction of the utilized “SpamArchive spam” dataset [16]. 
The image spam hunter (ISH) dataset was generated by a team 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
includes 

at  Northwestern  University  [17],  which 
jpg-
formatted actual images that are spam. Images of spam were 
gathered for the Princeton Spam Image Benchmark [18] from 
various  email  accounts.  For  these  datasets,  after  the  pre-
processing  stages  of  removing  the  corrupted  and  duplicate 
images,  we  were  left  with  a  dataset  of  6636  samples  for 
experiments.  Below  Table  Ⅱ  shows  the  specifics  of  the 
datasets utilized in the experiments. 

TABLE II.  

DATASETS USED IN SIMULATION 

As we discussed in the last section, there are 6636 samples 
in the dataset, and we divided the dataset into the training set 
and testing set with a ratio of 3:1. Therefore, as shown in Fig.4, 
the confusion matrix of the proposed XAI-based CNN spam 
image detector is presented. From the confusion matrix, the 
statistical  metrics  including  accuracy,  recall,  precision,  and 
F1-score could be calculated as 97.16%, 95.68%, 98.79%, and 
97.16%, which are acceptable compared to other benchmark 
algorithms shown in Table III.

However, the explainability of the testing samples could 
be expanded through heatmap, LIME, and SHAP approaches 
in  the  proposed  XAI-CNN  framework.  As  shown  in  Fig.  5, 
SHAP  values  provided  an  additive  measure  of  feature 
importance. In the context of an image, each pixel is treated as 
a feature, therefore, SHAP values can be used to determine the 
pixel level importance in classifying images Fig. 5 showed the 
samples of 2 spam images and 1 normal image. 

B.  Statistical Metrics 

In this section, in terms of evaluating the performance of 
the detection models, the confusion matrix is used where FP, 
FN, TP, and TN are defined as follows. False Positive (FP) is 
the number of misclassified legitimate emails, False Negative 
(FN) is the amount of misclassified spam, True Positive (TP) 
is the number of properly classified spam, and True Negative 
(TN) is the number of correctly classified legitimate emails. 
Based  on  these,  the  statistical  metrics  including  accuracy, 
recall,  precision,  and  F1-score  are  defined  as  the  following 
equations: 

𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴  =

the statistical metrics discussed above. In addition, we provide

On  the  other  hand,  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7  could  show  the 
explainability  provided  by  the  heatmap  and  the  LIME 
methods experimented on a spam image sample and a normal 
image sample. LIME method works by making alterations to 
different  features  on  a  particular  input  and  seeing  which  of 
those  alterations  make  the  biggest  difference  to  the  output 
classification. Thus highlighting the features most relevant to 
the  network’s  decision.  The  key  to  LIME’s  effectiveness  is 
local elements. That means that it does not try to explain all 
the decisions that a network might make across all possible 
inputs, only the factors that use to determine its classification 
for one particular input. 

IV.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

proposed

To avoid image spam evading the conventional text-based 
spam  e-mail  filters  and  provide  a  robotic  and  explainable

introduces  an  XAI-CNN  model  for  an  image  spam  email 
filtering system. After the decisions made by the CNN model,

methodologies of XAI (i.e., SHAP and LIME) to increase the 
explainability, transparency, and user trust in the CNN-model 
decisions.  To  demonstrate  the  efficiency  of  the  XAI-CNN 
model, we utilized 4 image spam datasets to compose a large

demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework in 
detecting  image  spam  as  well  as  incorporating  additional 
information  and  an  explanation  of  how  and  why  the  CNN 
model makes such detection judgments.

In future work, we plan to explore the explainability of the 
OCR-transformed image spam in the context of a text-based 
detector and compare the differences between interpretability 
differences  of  the  image-based  and  text-based  frameworks. 
Furthermore,  user  interfaces  will  be  developed  to  provide 
explainabilities  and  transparency  of  decisions  based  on 
multiple XAI methods.
