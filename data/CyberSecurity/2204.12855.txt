Abstract—  DDoS  attacks,  also  known  as  distributed  denial  of  service  (DDoS)  attacks,  have 

emerged  as  one  of  the  most  serious  and  fastest-growing  threats  on  the  Internet.  Denial-of-service 

(DDoS) attacks are an example of cyber attacks that target a specific system or network in an attempt 

to  render it inaccessible or  unusable  for  a  period of  time.  As  a result, improving the  detection  of 

diverse types of DDoS cyber threats with better algorithms and higher accuracy while keeping the 

computational  cost  under  control  has  become  the  most  significant  component  of  detecting  DDoS 

cyber  threats.  In  order  to  properly  defend  the  targeted  network  or  system,  it  is  critical  to  first 

determine  the  sort  of  DDoS  assault  that  has  been  launched  against  it.  A  number  of  ensemble 

classification  techniques  are  presented  in  this  paper,  which  combine  the  performance  of  various 

algorithms.  They  are  then  compared  to  existing  Machine  Learning  Algorithms  in  terms  of  their 

effectiveness in detecting different types of DDoS attacks using accuracy, F1 scores, and ROC curves. 

The results shows high accuracy and good performance.

1.  Introduction 

DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack originates from many sources scattered over multiple network 

locations.  DoS attacks are primarily motivated by the  desire to significantly  degrade the performance  or 

completely consume a certain resource, and  a process to exploit a machine defect and cause failure of a 

processing or exhausting the system resources by exploiting a system flaw. Yet another method of assaulting 

the target system is to flood the network and monopolise it, so preventing anyone else from utilising it [1]. 

DoS attacks are defined and classified by the prohibition of access to the victim machine or network, whereas 

DDoS attack is the use of a large number of systems from distributed environment to launch the  attack, 

which is defined and classified by the use of many computer systems or services. Keep in mind that attack 

agents can be any vulnerable devices or resource that has the capability of running the suspicious  code, such 

as Internet of Things devices, networked PCs, servers, and armed mobile devices, among other things [2].

Figure 2: DDoS attack Country wise 

There are numerous defensive measures available against distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults[4-

5], but none of them is completely effective. There are a variety of factors contributing to this, including 

the following: 

•  Everyone has the ability to launch an attack due to the quantity of open-source tools available on the 

internet. 

 
 
 
 
•  DDoS  attacks  almost  always  include forged  IP  packets, making it  nearly impossible to identify the 

source of an attack.  

•  DDoS attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. In addition, the length of an attack has dropped 

in recent years to around 4 minutes, down from previously. The affected machine crashes as a result, 

preventing any defence solution from detecting the attack. As a result, acquiring complete information 

on distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults is extremely difficult. 

• 

It is impossible to directly compare defensive devices with their competitors on the market because 

there is no common benchmark for DDoS defence filters in the computer sector. 

•  Cloud computing, fog computing, industrial computer systems and the Internet of Things are among 

the many innovative technologies that are making their way to market.  

Improve standard defence methods so that they may be used in these conditions is a difficult and time-

consuming task that will need a great deal of effort to do. 

In the following sections, you will find an outline of the paper: A discussion and analysis of related existing 

studies  for  protective  methods  against distributed  denial  of  service  are  presented  in  Section 2.  (DDoS). 

Section 3 introduced and examined our method, as well as the fundamental concepts that drive it. Section 

4 introduced and explored our approach. In Section 4, we provide an evaluation of our proposed work, and 

Section 5 of the paper finishes the research with a conclusion. 

2.  Literature Review 

The DDoS attack is  not a new attack but even though after having so many existing techniques, the attackers 

are able to perform this attack. The reason behind it is lack of security concern, the existing mechanisms 

are having limitations and exploration of the vulnerabilities in terms of parameters used in network.  Several 

security strategies were proposed [5-8] for the identification and detection of distributed denial-of-service 

attacks (DDoS) in this study. 

It was advocated by the authors in [6] that a low-cost defensive method against DDoS attacks should be 

based on differences in entropy between DDoS assaults and normal traffic be used. In addition, the authors 

developed a method for weakening the onslaught's overall strength. It offers several advantages over other 

current systems, including a high detection rate, a low false-positive rate, and the potential of mitigating 

the problem. It is currently in development. 

Authentication  and  security  issues  related  with  smart  vessels  in  marine  transport  are  addressed  by  the 

authors [7] through the development of a method for handling these issues. By authenticating devices in 

 
 
 
 
marine  transport  and  detecting  various  cyberattacks,  such  as  distributed  denial  of  service  (DDoS).  The 

proposed  method  authenticates  smart  vessel  access  using  an  identity-based  methodology,  which  is 

described in detail below. This strategy, on the other hand, is limited to maritime transportation. 

The authors in reference [9] discuss the development of a secure data sharing method as well as a cyber-

attack  detection  methodology  that  make  use  of  identity-based  encryption  (IBE)  and  deep  learning 

algorithms as part of their research. To manage sensitive information, the proposed system makes use of 

identity-based encryption. 

The authors' [10] goal in this study is to provide a better understanding of a comprehensive framework for 

comprehending  the  characteristics  of  vulnerabilities  in  information  systems,  such  as  the  vulnerability 

category a specific vulnerability falls under belongs to, the potential threats it poses, and the warning signs 

that it is approaching for their assistance in fixing the issue. As an additional source of data, the authors use 

a leading vulnerability report site to compile information on actual vulnerabilities discovered in companies' 

information systems.  

Authors in [11] suggested a DDoS detection system that was boosted. The method in Internet of Things 

(IoT) devices RFID tags were proposed by the authors for reciprocal identification.  Devices connected to 

the Internet of Things require authentication.  

In  2021,  the  author [12]  proposed  a    game  theory-based  security mechanism  for  analysing  data.  DDoS 

attacks are being mitigated by the use of a multi-attribute based auction. In this case, the According to the 

authors,  a  reputation-based  detection  system  is  developed,  in  which  the,  the  reputation  of  a  user  is 

determined  by  his  or  her  marginal  utility.  There  are  two  separate  Various  payment  methods  for  both 

legitimate and fraudulent consumers have been proposed.

3 Proposed Methodology  

Following a detailed discussion of the dataset, we will apply a preprocessing procedure that includes feature 

selection. At the end of the process, we train and test the model on datasets that have been selected based 

on their features. 

3.1 Approach  

In our paper, we are focusing on preprocessing of the data, feature selection[13], model the machine by 

selecting classifier and then prediction on the unseen data and based on performance evaluation we validate 

our prediction on new unseen data. The approach is as following: 

Preparation of data: The third phase is comprised of a number of tasks that are all focused on turning the 

raw data gathering into a finished dataset, as described above. The nature and order of activities may differ, 

and some tasks may even be repeated more than once, depending on the status of the raw data at the time 

of  completion.  Data  cleansing,  feature  selection,  and  data  transformation  are  just  a  few  of  the 

responsibilities involved. 

Modelling:  When  selecting  and  applying  relevant  modelling  techniques  to  the  data,  the  fourth  phase  is 

called the selection phase. In most cases, the parameters of these models are calibrated in order to get the 

best possible performance. 

This process is strongly related to data preparation since modelling may reveal new issues with the data 

that were not previously apparent. In addition, the manner in which the data is prepared can result in the 

usage of a variety of models. 

Performance Evaluation: During the evaluation phase, the models that were used in the previous phase are 

thoroughly assessed and reviewed by experts. During this phase, the tasks completed are compared to the 

planned objectives in order to confirm that all business requirements have been taken into consideration 

and are being met. Furthermore, the models are assessed for generalisation to data that has not yet been 

observed. There needs to be a clear understanding of how the data mining results should be implemented 

by the time the evaluation step is completed.

3.2 DataSet and Preprocessing 

Datasets are an essential component of machine learning algorithms. Any type of machine learning model 

conceptualization will be successful if a dataset with real-world circumstances or events to be categorised 

is obtained or developed and included. During both the training and testing phases of the model, this is true. 

CICDoS2019 [14] is a dataset supplied by CIC that is designed to offer trustworthy information for the 

training of DDoS attack detection algorithms. 

Many different types of attacks that were implemented in the CIC dataset were divided intoclass label for 

experiments 

It is estimated that the dataset includes sufficient information for model training and validation because it 

comprises a total of 5775786 rows of information in CSV extension files. There are a total of 88 attributes 

in the CIC DDoS dataset, which are listed in table 2 below.

3.3 Modelling 

To  analyze  the  datasets,  four  different  supervised  learning  models  have  been  chosen  for  comparison. 

Several criteria[15-17] are used to select the models, which include the presence of both parametric and 

nonparametric models, the use of algorithms from a number of categories, and the application of models 

that have been extensively used in previous research and publications. 

3.3.1 Random Forest 

The  random  forest  algorithm  is  an  ensemble  technique  that  classifies  data  by  using  a  large  number  of 

decision  trees  in  a  random  fashion.  Ensemble  algorithms[18-20]  are  more  accurate  than  single  model 

algorithms because they combine numerous models. Each decision tree is randomly selected from a training 

set, and then each decision tree's vote is aggregated from all of the other decision trees in a random fashion, 

and the final object examined is provided. A primary reason for using the classifier is because it performs 

well with huge datasets and can handle a large number of input variables. 

3.3.2 Decision Tree 

The classification process in a decision tree begins at the root node and categorises observations based on 

the values of the characteristics associated with each observation. Nodes indicate a single characteristic, 

and the values that they can adopt are represented by their corresponding nodes[21-24]. 

Working its way down from the root node, the algorithm iteratively computes the information gain for each 

feature in the training set, starting with the most significant feature. To estimate the extent of discrimination 

imposed by the features towards the target groups, it is necessary to consider information gain. When it 

comes to categorising each observation, the higher the information acquisition, the greater the value of the 

attribute. The root node is replaced by the attribute that provides the greatest amount of information gain, 

and the algorithm continues splitting the data set by the selected feature to produce subsets of the original 

data set. 

3.3.3 SVM 

It is a supervised learning approach; it divides the different classes using a hyper plane and then constructs 

a  model  that  is  capable  of  detecting  previously  unseen  samples[25-27].  For  multilabel  classification, 

LinearSVC  from  Sci-Kit  Learn  was  used  using  the  parameter  "ovr"  one-vs-rest,  which  stands  for  one-

versus-rest.  The  square  hinge  was  picked  as  the  loss  function  because  it  produces  results  that  are  both 

computationally efficient and effective. In order to lower the margin, the regularisation and cost parameters 

are both set to one. 

3.3.4 Naïve Bayes 

 
 
This classifier is based on Bayes' Theorem, which assumes that all events are independent of one another. 

In statistics, two events are said to be independent if the probability of one does not have an impact on the 

probability of the other[28]. 

4.   Experimental Results and Performance Analysis 

For the evaluation of the performance in  classification machine learning[29-31], we have the following 

metrics: 

Accuracy: It is defined as correctly classified from the total samples. 

Recall: The recall rate is a measure of how many of the real positives were discovered or recalled after the 

fact. 

Precision: Precision can be defined as the proportion of accurately identified positives, also known as true 

positives, in a sample. 

F-Score: In machine learning, the F-measure, which is a combination of precision and recall, provides an 

overall accuracy score for a model. A good F-measure score indicates that a model has low false positives 

as well as low false negatives, and as a result, a model that correctly identifies threats while generating the 

fewest false alarms is preferred. 

RoC Curve: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is used to evaluate the performance of a 

classification model by taking into account the False Positive Rate (FPR) and True Positive Rate (TPR). 

Table 4 and figure 6 shows the values of Recall, Precesion and F Score and Table 5 and figure 7 shows the 

accuracy results of all the applied classifiers. Also Figure 8,9,10, and 11 are used to present the RoC graph 

of RANDOM FOREST,DECESION TREE, NAÏVE BAYES, AND SVM.

dataset and depicted in figures from 6 to 11. As per table 4. All four performed well in classified the MSSQL 

traffic and both are able to identify benign traffic 100%. But  in case of LDAP Random Forest Performed 

well in comparison to other three classifiers, however decision tree and naïve bayes are some how failed to 

recognize the benign traffic properly. 

By the analysis of RoC Curve also , the result of the performance metrices can be verified. 

5.  Conclusions and Future Work 

The DDoS attack was classified into multiple classes using ML algorithms, and each type was detected and 

validated using distinct criteria. For DDoS multiclass Cyberthreat identification, a comprehensive analysis 

of  multiple  ML  algorithms  was  conducted  and  Random  Forest  and  SVM  Classifier  having  the  highest 

accuracy score of 99.99%. However, the naïve bayes got the 99.98% and decision tree 99.89% accuracy to 

achieve the target. Here we have targeted 3 class labels such as benign traffic, MSSQL and LDAP traffic, 

in future many other types of DDoS attack can also be targeted for classification and prediction.
