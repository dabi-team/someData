Abstract.  Monitoring  and  automation  of  the  critical  infrastructures  like  the 
power grid is improvised by the support of an efficient and secure communica-
tion network. Due to the low cost, low power profile, dynamic nature, improved 
accuracy and scalability, wireless sensor networks (WSN) became an attractive 
choice for the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system of the 
smart grid. However, the energy efficiency and security of WSN depends high-
ly on the network design and routing scheme. In this paper, a WSN based Se-
cure and Energy Efficient Remote Monitoring Technique (SERMT) is proposed 
by demonstrating a WSN based ICT network model for pervasive monitoring of 
the generation and transmission part of the power network in a smart grid sys-
tem. The performance of the proposed network model designed for a smart grid 
of  IEEE  118-Bus  system  coupled  with  the  secure  routing  technique  is  tested 
during cyber-attacks by means of NS2 and the simulation results indicate that it 
performs  better  than  existing  smart  grid  monitoring  methods  like  Lo-ADI  [1] 
with respect to packet drop count and throughput.

Introduction 

A sustainable lifestyle for human race is reliant upon critical infrastructures like pow-
er network, communication network, water supply system, transportation system etc. 
Therefore,  pervasive  monitoring  [2]  and  control  over  such  critical  systems  is  very 
important.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  only  an  improved  Information  and  Communication 
Technology (ICT) can transform every such system into a smart system and thus can 
form a smart city. Smart grids are an inherent part of a smart city and it is obtained by 
incorporating  features  like  full-duplex  communication  between  the  ICT  entities,  au-
tomated  metering  in  the  smart  homes,  power  distribution  automation,  and  above  all 
intelligent  decision  making  by  means  of  pervasive  monitoring  of  the  power  system 
and securing its stability. Therefore, it is beyond any question that the ICT network of 
a  smart  grid  must  be  accurate,  scalable,  and  secure  enough  to  instantly  identify  any 
kind of abnormal behavior in the entities of the power network, securely communicate 
that information to the control center (CC) and thereby help in taking necessary and 
timely action to ensure uninterrupted power supply. 

Although, designing of a robust ICT network for smart grid has become a boiling 
topic of research, the best suited ICT design for a smart grid is still not very clear. In 
[3] only a crude idea of the design of a joint power-communication network is given 
using  a  test  system  consisting  of  14  buses.  While,  the  authors  of  [4],  have  come  up 
with a realistic design of the ICT for smart grid by taking help from a power utility in 
the U.S. Southwest; their ICT system relies completely on wired channels that either 
use  SONET-over-Ethernet  or  Ethernet-over-Dense  Wavelength  Division  Multiplex-
ing. A completely wired ICT system is neither cost effective nor energy saving. Every 
communication entity in [4] draws power and thus a huge amount of power is devoted 
for monitoring the power network itself. Moreover,  addition/isolation of ICT entities 
for  hardening  purpose  or  fault  tolerance/during  a  failure  or  a  security  threat  is  ex-
tremely difficult and costly in a wired system.  

Smart sensor nodes like Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are popular in remote 
monitoring system for smart grid. Power generation and transmission, power quality, 
equipment fitness, load capacity of equipment and load balancing in the grid can also 
be  monitored  by  data  sensing  techniques.  As  a  result,  wireless  sensor  networks 
(WSNs) are currently acquiring attention of the researchers for the purpose of design-
ing  the  ICT  network  for  a  smart  grid  system.  WSNs  are comprised of  low  powered 
sensor nodes  with  easy installation process, lesser maintenance requirement, low in-
stallation cost, low power profile, high accuracy and scalability. All these have con-
vinced the researchers that WSNs are a very good choice for the designing of the ICT 
of a smart grid. Therefore, in this paper, a new design of the ICT network for a smart 
grid is proposed using WSN.  

Despite all these advantages, the most common drawback of a sensor node is that it 
is battery powered and battery replacement is difficult. As a result, energy conserva-
tion  becomes  important.  In  Secure  and  Energy  Efficient  Remote  Monitoring  Tech-
nique  (SERMT)  energy  efficiency  is  obtained  by  energy  aware  routing  and  use  of 
more expensive rechargeable Energy Harvesting Sensor Nodes (EHSNs) for MU and 
PMU data transfer respectively. Also, the sensor nodes as well as the wireless chan-
nels  are  vulnerable  to  common  cyber-attacks  [5]  like  sinkhole,  wormhole,  Sybil  at-
tack, packet eavesdropping, flooding attack and most importantly false data injection 
attack by means of node compromise. SERMT aims at securing the data transfer to-
gether with energy conservation by means of light weight security protocols used in 
[6] 
like  Elliptic-Curve-Public-Key  Cryptography  (ECC),  Elliptic-Curve-Diffie-
Helman  Key  exchange  scheme  (ECDH),  Nested  Hashed  Message  Authentication 
Codes (NH-MAC) and RC5 symmetric cypher. 

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the 
ICT network setup phase for SERMT. A realistic risk model for the SERMT network 
design is given in section 3 of this paper. Mitigation of the threats discussed in section 
3 by adopting a secure and energy efficient routing technique is explained in section 
4. Section 5 does performance analysis of the proposed scheme SERMT by means of 
comparing the simulation results with an existing secure remote monitoring technique 
for  power  grid named  as  Lo-ADI  [1].  Sections  6  concludes  the  paper  and discusses 
the scope for future works.

Overview of the ICT network setup phase for SERMT 

In  order  to  provide  a  reliable  remote  monitoring  for  the  smart  grid,  a  generic  ICT 
network design is proposed by SERMT that can be applied on any given power net-
work. In this section, the network setup phase for SERMT is divided into four steps. 
Each step is illustrated with the help of IEEE 14-Bus system as the power network. 

Fig. 1. Region division and sensor node placement in a smart grid of IEEE 14-Bus system 

In the first step, a given power grid is divided into several substations. The buses 
connected by transformers are placed in one substation with the assumption that trans-
formers remain within a substation only [7]. This process is repeated  until no trans-
formers are left. Then each bus is placed in a unique substation. In Fig.1, the IEEE 14 
bus system is divided into 11 substations denoted by 𝑆𝑖 where i is the substation ID.  

After the substation division, the distance between all pairs of substations (𝑆𝑖& 𝑆𝑗) 
is  calculated  [4].  Now,  starting  from  a  substation 𝑆𝑖 with  the maximum  connectivity 
among the substations at the network borders, all substations which are within a given 
distance of it, are marked as substations of a common monitoring region 𝑅𝑥. Then the 
next substation which is the closest to 𝑆𝑖 but beyond the given distance and which is 
not  yet  placed  in  a  monitoring  region,  is  selected  and  the  same  process  is  repeated. 
This  process  is  continued  till  every  substation  is  placed  within  a  monitoring region. 
For  example,  in  the  IEEE  14-Bus  system,  substations 𝑆3, 𝑆4, 𝑆5, 𝑆6, 𝑆7, 𝑆8 and 𝑆10 are 
at the borders of the smart grid area. Among them, 𝑆4 has the maximum connectivity, 
therefore the region division starts from it. Fig 1. shows that after this process is com-
pleted, the smart grid network for IEEE 14-Bus system is divided into 4 regions. 

SERMT  considers  two  different  types  of  smart  sensors  for  monitoring  the  power 
network entities. The first type is the Measuring Unit (MU) based smart sensors [8]. 

 
 
The  MU-based  smart  sensors  have  a  sensing  unit  consisting  of  sensors  like  Current 
Transformer (CT) and Voltage Transformer (VT) and a merging unit for performing 
signal amplification, conditioning and analog-digital conversion. There is an internal 
clock in the merging unit that can timestamp every sample and thereby time synchro-
nize  them  with  an  external  UTC  source.  The  MU-based  sensor  has  a  network  com-
munication module which helps it to communicate with Intelligent Electronic Devices 
(IEDs)  or  applications.  The  second  type  of  sensors  used  for  SERMT  is  the  PMU-
based smart sensors. The sensing module of a PMU has sensors like voltage and cur-
rent sensor which provide analog inputs for the PMU. Current and voltage phases are 
sampled at a rate of 48 samples per cycle in a PMU using a common time source for 
synchronization. It also has an internal clock and a processing module responsible for 
signal  conditioning,  timestamped  analog-digital  signal  conversion  and  computing 
voltage and current phasors to produce a synchronized phasor and frequency. 

In  this  step,  MU-based  sensors  are  placed  at  every  bus  in  the  power  network. 
PMU-based sensors are placed at some of the buses using an optimal PMU placement 
algorithm  [7].  Low-cost,  non-rechargeable  battery  enabled  sensor  nodes  denoted 
by 𝑁𝑗 with ID j are randomly dispersed across the network area. These  𝑁𝑗𝑠 can carry 
the MU-based sensor data to the CCs in a power efficient manner. A phasor data con-
centrator  (PDC),  responsible  for  receiving  accumulating  PMU  data  from  multiple 
PMUs, is placed at each region of the smart grid and few EHSNs denoted by  𝐸𝑆𝑗 with 
j as the ID are randomly deployed across the smart grid region. The idea behind the 
deployment of the two kinds of sensor nodes is that, the cheaper  𝑁𝑗𝑠 will follow an 
event-driven hierarchical routing approach to send the  MU data  from the  MU-based 
sensor nodes to the CCs; and the  𝐸𝑆𝑗𝑠 will always be active to accumulate synchro-
phasor data from the substations of each region and send the data to the local PDCs 
and finally to the CCs. Due to the high volume of PMU data transfer from each sub-
station having a PMU, the sensor nodes carrying them should always be active.  

In Fig.1. the MU-based sensors are denoted by 𝑀𝑖 where i is the ID of the sensor 
and it is same as the bus number it is placed at. The PMUs are represented by 𝑃𝑖 and 
they are numbered in the order they are placed. It is assumed that  𝑁𝑗𝑠 and  𝐸𝑆𝑗𝑠 are 
deployed region wise and are numbered in the order of their deployment.  

SERMT assumes that there is  a main  CC and  a backup  CC. So,  even if the main 
CC is damaged, the backup CC can efficiently monitor the network state. The connec-
tivity of each substation is calculated based on the number of transmission lines con-
necting that substation with other substations. The substation having the highest con-
nectivity is selected as the main CC and that having the second highest connectivity is 
selected  as  the  backup  CC.  After  the  CCs  are  selected,  all  substations  are  equipped 
with a router acting as a gateway for the substation servers and the servers in each CC 
are access points for the operator. The CC-gateways can wirelessly receive data from 
the sensors and PDCs and send those  data  to server via a wired LAN connection in 
control centers. In the Fig.1., 𝑆1 is the main CC and 𝑆2 is the backup CC.

Risk model and assumptions for the SERMT network setup 

The  WSN  nodes  are  vulnerable  to  several  attacks  that  are  explored  by  researchers 
over the ages. In SERMT, some of the common attacks on WSN are considered. The 
threat model for SERMT predicts that a compromised entity of the ICT can pretend as 
a CC-gateway and congest the network with bogus communications to launch a flood-
ing  attack  which  can  result  in  denial  of  service  (DoS)  by  the  ICT  entities.  Another 
common  attack  of  the  WSN  is  the  Sybil  attack  [5]  where  a  legitimate  node  of  the 
network  gets  compromised  and  deceits  the  other  nodes  by  providing  multiple  fake 
location  information  of  itself.  In  SERMT  network  setup,  any  ICT  entity  except  the 
substation entities can impose a Sybil attack and oblige other entities to forward data 
to an entity that does not exist in that location resulting in increased packet drop. In a 
node compromise attack, the attacker physically gets hold of the node and reprograms 
it to launch attacks like wormhole attack and packet eavesdropping attack [5]. These 
attacks  can  also  be  launched  by  an  outsider’s  node  deployed  in  the  network.  The 
Sinkhole  attack  can  be  launched  by  attackers  with  high  quality  equipment  and  they 
can inform the ICT entities about a high-quality entity in their sensing zone, so that all 
the other entities select it to forward the data to the CC. This node gathers all the data 
the CCs do not receive any information about the system state from the network. 

In order to provide security to the ICT infrastructure for the smart grid, the follow-

ing assumptions are made in the proposed work: 

1. The substation equipment like the server and the gateway are trustworthy and it is 
impossible for an attacker to compromise those components. The servers authenti-
cate themselves to the sensors or PDCs to avoid flooding attack [5]. 

2. Each  entity  of  the  ICT  network  is  provided  with  a  global  key 𝐺𝐵𝐾 which  an  at-

tacker cannot get hold of even if the entity is compromised. 

3. A unique set of elliptic curves is stored in the memory of each  ICT entity for the 
purpose of ECC and ECDH protocols. Also, in order to achieve those mechanisms, 
it is assumed that any pair of entities in the network agrees upon all the domain pa-
rameters of the elliptic curves stored in them. 

4. The two CC-servers generate two separate one-way hash chains using SHA-1 hash 
function  [6]. The  starting  key  for  each  chain  is  randomly  selected  by  the  each  of 
the servers. All the ICT entities are provided with same hash functions and the last 
keys of the two chains so that they can authenticate the control messages from the 
control center servers and avoid a Sinkhole attack. 

5. Each ICT entity in the network is aware of its own ID, location information, region 

ID and ID of the servers. 

6. All the PDCs can communicate with other PDCs in the neighboring regions.

Secure and Energy Efficient Routing Scheme of SERMT 

The goal of the ICT network for a smart grid is to securely transmit the sensed data 
from  the  sensors  to  the  control  centers  and  help  in  remote  monitoring  of  the  power 

 
grid. In order to achieve this with the help of a WSN based ICT network, a secure and 
energy efficient routing technique should be followed. In this section, the secure rout-
ing scheme of SERMT is divided into 4 modules.  

4.1  Module 1: Initial trust value estimation of the ICT entities 

Trust 

value 

(𝑇𝑉𝑖)

format 

In  the  first  module  of  SERMT,  the  main  control  center  server (𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1) sends  a 
number of test messages to the sensor nodes and PDC in  its own region to calculate 
their 
.  The  message 
𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1 →∗
: 𝑀𝑆𝐺||𝐾𝑥||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐺𝐵𝐾; 𝑀𝑆𝐺||𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1𝐼𝐷||𝐾𝑥) where  *  denotes  a  set  of  ICT  enti-
ties, MSG is the test message, 𝐾𝑥 is a random key from the sequence of keys generat-
ed by the hash function and this key is never used again. A Hash based Message Au-
thentication Code (HMAC) is generated over the MSG, server ID and the key using 
the  shared  global  key  GBK  and  appended  with  the  message,  so  that  any  non-
legitimate  node  which do not  have  the  GBK  and  the  server  ID  cannot    separate  the 
HMAC  from  the  original  message  and  therefore  cannot  overhear  the  message  from 
the  server  to  the  other  entities.  The 𝑇𝑉𝑖 is  calculated  by  the  server  for  each  entity  i 
using eq.1. 

is: 

                                               𝑇𝑉𝑖 =

𝑀𝑆𝐺𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑑
𝑀𝑆𝐺𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡

∗ 100                                           (1) 

Entities having a 𝑇𝑉𝑖 of more than 40% are selected as trusted nodes and any legit-
imate node having a lower 𝑇𝑉𝑖 are added to the threat list of the server. Now, the node 
𝑋𝑖 with the highest 𝑇𝑉𝑖 in that region is selected by the CC-server to forward a request 
message to the nodes closest to it in the adjacent regions. The format of the request 
message  is:  𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1 → 𝑋𝑖: 𝑅𝑄𝑀||||𝐾𝑥||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐺𝐵𝐾; 𝑀𝑆𝐺||𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1𝐼𝐷||𝐾𝑥)  where 
RQM is the request to calculate  𝑇𝑉𝑖, 𝐾𝑥 is a new random key from the key chain and 
HMAC  is  generated  and  appended  with  the  message.  First,  the 𝑇𝑉𝑖 of  the  nodes  of 
adjacent regions closest to 𝑋𝑖 are calculated by 𝑋𝑖 in the same manner. If those nodes 
have a 𝑇𝑉𝑖 greater than 40% then the RQM is forwarded to them. These nodes now 
calculate  the 𝑇𝑉𝑖 of  the  nodes  in  their  respective  regions  and  send  a  list  of  blocked 
node  IDs  having  low  𝑇𝑉𝑖  to  the  CC-server  via  𝑋𝑖 .  The  message  format  is:  𝑒𝑖 →
𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1: 𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡||𝑒𝑖𝐼𝐷||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐵𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡||𝑒𝑖𝐼𝐷) .  The  𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1  updates 
the  threat  list  using  this  data.  This  process  is  repeated  till  the  threat  nodes  of  each 
region  are  identified  by 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1 . 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1 shares  the  threat  list  with 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟2  via  a 
shortest path consisting of nodes in the trusted list. After both the servers get the list 
of trusted nodes in the network, the trust value of each node is shared with the substa-
tion gateways by 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1, via a shortest path to the substation consisting of the most 
trusted  nodes.  This  whole  process  is  repeated  at  a  regular  time  interval  by  alternate 
CC-servers. Each time the new trust values are assigned to the  ICT entities, both the 
servers  compute  a  public-private  key  pair (𝑈𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖, 𝑣𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑖) and  share  their  public 
key with all the entities in the network by broadcasting.  

4.2  Module 2: Data sensing by the smart sensor nodes and data forwarding by 

substation gateways 

The next phase of SERMT is the data sensing phase. In this phase, the smart sensors 
collect data from the power entities and forward that to the substation gateways. The 
substation  gateway  is  assumed  to  be  trusted.  The  CC-gateways  forward  the  data  di-
rectly to the connected servers, but they still need to send data to the other  CC. The 
gateways work differently  for sending MU-based and PMU-based sensor data to the 
CCs. In order to send the MU-based sensor data, the gateways send a forward request 
message to each jth node (𝑁𝑗) of that region at one-hop distance from it. The format of 
the  request  is: 𝐺𝑊𝑖 → 𝑁𝑗: 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑤_𝑅𝑄𝑀||𝐺𝑊𝑖𝐼𝐷||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐺𝐵𝐾; 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑤_𝑅𝑄𝑀||𝐺𝑊𝑖𝐼𝐷). 
Each 𝑁𝑗 receiving the forw_RQM from the gateway sends back an acknowledgement 
(ACK)  appended  with  information  like  their  remaining  battery  power  (𝐵𝑃𝑗)  and  its 
connectivity  with  other  nodes  in  the  same  region  (𝐶𝑗)  to  the  sender  in  the  format: 
𝑁𝑗 → 𝐺𝑖: 𝐴𝐶𝐾 ||𝐵𝑃𝑗|| 𝐶𝑗||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐺𝐵𝐾; 𝐴𝐶𝐾 ||𝐵𝑃𝑗|| 𝐶𝑗) .  In  case  a  node  receives 
forw_RQM from multiple gateways in that region, it selects the one closest to it.  The 
substation  gateways  calculate  a  data  forwarding  score 𝐷𝐹𝑗 for  all  the  nodes  sending 
back ACK to it using eq. 2. 

                                              𝐷𝐹𝑗 = 𝐵𝑃𝑗 ∗ 𝑇𝑉𝑗 ∗ 𝐶𝑗                                                            (2) 

Now,  each  gateway 𝐺𝑊𝑖 generates  a  key  pair  having  a  public  and  a  private  key 
(𝑈𝐺𝑊𝑖, 𝑣𝐺𝑊𝑖) using ECC and forward the public key 𝑈𝐺𝑊𝑖 to the jth  sensor node hav-
ing  the  highest  𝐷𝐹𝑗  calculated  by  itself  using  the  message  format:  𝐺𝑊𝑖 →
𝑁𝑗: 𝑈𝐺𝑊𝑖||𝐺𝑊𝑖𝐼𝐷||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐺𝐵𝐾; 𝑈𝐺𝑊𝑖||𝐺𝑊𝑖𝐼𝐷) .  The  𝑁𝑗  receiving  the  public  key 
from the 𝐺𝑊𝑖 also generates a private-public key pair (𝑣𝑁𝑗, 𝑈𝑁𝑗) using ECC and send 
back  the  public  key  and  its  ID  in  the  similar  format  to 𝐺𝑊𝑖. 𝐺𝑊𝑖 now  computes  a 
point  in  the  elliptic  curve (𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑘) = 𝑣𝐺𝑊𝑖 . 𝑈𝑁𝑗  and 𝑁𝑗 computes  a  point (𝑥𝑘, 𝑦𝑘) =
𝑣𝑁𝑗 . 𝑈𝐺𝑊𝑖 where 𝑥𝑘 ,  the  x  coordinate  of  the  computed  point  becomes  their  shared 
secret.  This  is  ECDH  key  exchange  scheme  where  the  shared  secret  calculated  by 
both  parties  is  same─ 𝑣𝐺𝑊𝑖 . 𝑈𝑁𝑗 = 𝑣𝐺𝑊𝑖 . 𝑣𝑁𝑗. 𝐺 = 𝑣𝑁𝑗 . 𝑣𝐺𝑊𝑖. 𝐺=𝑣𝑁𝑗 . 𝑈𝐺𝑊𝑖;  where  G 
is  the  generator  of  the  elliptic  curve.  This  shared  secret 𝑥𝑘 is  the  temporary  key  for 
exchanging encrypted data between the 𝐺𝑊𝑖 and 𝑁𝑗. 𝐺𝑊𝑖 now encrypts the aggregat-
ed  MU  data  from  the  buses  of  that  substation  using  RC5  symmetric  cypher  with 𝑥𝑘 
format:  𝐺𝑊𝑖 →
and 
𝑁𝑗: 𝐸𝑀𝐷||𝐺𝑊𝑖𝐼𝐷||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐺𝐵𝐾; 𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝑥𝑘; 𝐸𝑀𝐷||𝐺𝑊𝑖𝐼𝐷)).  The  gateways  keep  on 
forwarding  the  encrypted  MU  data  to  the  same node  until  the  servers  initiate  a new 
round of module 1. 

to  𝑁𝑗 by  using  NH-MAC 

forwards

At the same time, the PMUs also sense data from the power entities and send  that 
to  the  corresponding  substation  gateway.  Each  PMU  containing  substation  gateway 
now forwards forw_RQM to the EHSNs of that region within its range. In the similar 
way, the 𝐸𝑆𝑗s receiving the forw_RQM sends back ACK to the gateway with only the 
connectivity  information.  Now,  the  gateway  recalculates  the  𝑇𝑉𝑗  for  each 𝐸𝑆𝑗  like 

 
module 1 and selects the node with the highest current 𝑇𝑉𝑗. The same key exchange 
scheme  is  established  with  the  most  trusted 𝐸𝑆𝑗 as  it  was  done  with  the 𝑁𝑗s  and  the 
RC5  encrypted  PMU  data  is  forwarded  to 𝐸𝑆𝑗 in  the  similar  format  with  NH-MAC. 
𝐺𝑊𝑖s recalculate the 𝑇𝑉𝑗 of the 𝐸𝑆𝑗𝑠 at regular intervals to repeat this process of key 
and data exchange and do not wait for the servers to estimate 𝑇𝑉𝑗  of the 𝐸𝑆𝑗𝑠. How-
ever, if a server reinitiates module 1, all the substation gateways wait till the process 
is  complete  and  they  are  updated  with  the  new  trust  values  of  all  the  nodes  in  their 
region. The CC-gateways also use the same process to send data to the other CC. 

4.3  Module 3: Data forwarding to the control centers 

In this module, two separate routing techniques are followed by the  𝑁𝑗𝑠 and  𝐸𝑆𝑗𝑠 to 
forward  data  to  the  CCs. 𝑁𝑗𝑠 receiving  data  from  the 𝐺𝑊𝑖𝑠 first  decrypt  them  using 
the  same  temporary  key 𝑥𝑘.  Then,  a  join  request  (join_RQM)  is  broadcasted  in  the 
format:𝑁𝑗 →∗: 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛_𝑅𝑄𝑀||𝑁𝑗𝐼𝐷||𝐻𝑀𝐴𝐶(𝐺𝐵𝐾; 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛_𝑅𝑄𝑀||𝑁𝑗𝐼𝐷) to  all  other  𝑁𝑠 in 
that  region  by  that  𝑁𝑗 .  Malicious  nodes  present  in  the  network  receiving  the 
join_RQM cannot decode the HMAC as they do not have the GBK and thereby they 
cannot  join  any  legitimate  data-carrying 𝑁𝑗.  Each 𝑁𝑗 receiving  ACK  from  other 𝑁𝑠 
format 
each 
provide 
RegionID||Timestamp_for_current_𝑇𝑉𝑖 ||𝐿𝑖𝑠𝑡_𝑜𝑓_𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝐼𝐷𝑠 .  The  server  as-
signed timestamp value for current 𝑇𝑉𝑖 is same for all the nodes in a common region 
and the list of substation IDs denote the data carried from which of the substations in 
that cluster. Therefore, all the nodes getting the common cluster ID are considered as 
nodes of a cluster. Multiple clusters can be formed in each region of the smart grid.

After the cluster formation in every region, a cluster head (CH) is selected for each 
cluster using a candidate value (𝐶𝑉𝑗) calculated using eq.3. by each node j in the clus-
ter and shared with all other nodes in the cluster.  

                                                 𝐶𝑉𝑗 = 𝐵𝑃𝑗 ∗ 𝑇𝑉𝑗 ∗ 𝐶𝑛𝑗                                                            (3) 

In eq.3. 𝐵𝑃𝑗 is the remaining battery power of the node, 𝑇𝑉𝑗 is the current trust val-
ue of the node and 𝐶𝑛𝑗 is the connectivity of that node with the nodes of other adja-
cent regions. The 𝐶𝑛𝑗 of a node is determined based on the number of nodes in other 
regions that are within the sensing radius of the node j. Now, the CH generates a pub-
lic-private  key  pair  like 𝐺𝑊𝑖 and share  the  public  key  with  each  of  the  nodes  in  the 
cluster. The cluster member nodes (CMNs) also generate the key pair, send their pub-
lic key to the CH and compute their own 𝑥𝑘 using ECDH. Each CMN now forwards 
its data to the CH by encrypting the data with the 𝑥𝑘 using RC5 and generating NH-
MAC  just  like  each 𝐺𝑊𝑖 did.  The  CHs  after  receiving  the data  from  the  CMNs,  de-
crypt them with the  𝑥𝑘 for that CMN. Now each of the  CHs aggregate the data ob-
tained from the member nodes and encrypt that  with the public key (𝑈𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1) of the 
main  CC-server  using  ECC  based  public  key  cryptography.  In  case,  the  main  CC 
fails, the network is informed about that and all data are forwarded to the backup CC.   

Now, a CH of the main CC region, directly forwards the encrypted-aggregated data 
to the main CC-gateway. Other CHs use a modified version of Dijkstra’s shortest path 
algorithm to send the aggregated data to the main CC-gateway.  In this algorithm, the 
weight values (𝑊𝑖𝑗) of the link between two nodes i and j are determined by eq.4.

In  eq.4. 𝐷𝑖𝑗 stands  for  the  distance  between  the  sender  i  and  the  receiver  j, 𝐵𝑃𝑗 is 
the remaining battery and 𝑇𝑉𝑗 is the trust value of the node j. The same route is fol-
lowed by the nodes for sending data to the main CC until new nodes are selected by 
𝐺𝑊𝑖𝑠  for data forwarding. The main CC-gateway generates the HMAC over the re-
ceived message to check its authenticity and if a match is found, the data is forwarded 
to 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1.   𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1 periodically  sends  backup  to  the 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟2 via  the  shortest  path 
from 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1 to 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟2, determined using the same modified Dijkstra’s algorithm. 

In order to forward the PMU-based sensor data to the CCs, each data-carrying 𝐸𝑆𝑗 
node checks if the PDC of that region is adjacent to it. Each 𝐸𝑆𝑗 is updated with the 
location information and the current 𝑇𝑉𝑗 of other 𝐸𝑆𝑗𝑠 and the PDC in that region by 
the 𝐺𝑊𝑖𝑠 of that region. If a PDC is adjacent to an 𝐸𝑆𝑗, then the 𝐸𝑆𝑗 first decrypts the 
data and generate a public-private key pair to share the public key with the PDC. The 
PDC  also  does  the  same  and share  back  its  public  key  with  the 𝐸𝑆𝑗 to  complete  the 
ECDH key exchange. The node 𝐸𝑆𝑗 now forward the encrypted NH-MAC-ed data to 
it. 𝐸𝑆𝑗𝑠 which  are  not  near  a  PDC,  select  the  shortest  path  consisting  of  the  most 
trusted 𝐸𝑆𝑠 from itself to the PDC in that region to send their public key and the same 
route  is  followed  by  the  PDC  to  send back  its  own  public key  to  the 𝐸𝑆𝑗.  Now,  the 
encrypted  data  is  forwarded  through  the  same  path  to  the  PDC.  The  PDC  of  each 
region acts in the similar way as a  CH. It decrypts the data from each 𝐸𝑆𝑗 using the 
unique 𝑥𝑘 for that node and aggregates the whole data. A shortest path consisting of 
PDCs  only,  from  each  PDC  of  the  network  to  both  the  control  center  gateways  are 
calculated  only  once  and  is  never  repeated until  a  PDC  of  a  region  is  replaced  or  a 
PDC fails. In case, the 𝑇𝑉𝑖 of a PDC drops below the threshold, the 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1 adds it to 
the  blocked  list  and  selects  the  most  trusted 𝐸𝑆𝑗 node  to  perform  the  function  of  a 
PDC, until the actual PDC is replaced by a new one or its fault is diagnosed and re-
covered by the operator. Now, the aggregated data is encrypted using the public key 
of the 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟1 by each PDC and forwarded to the main  CC-gateway. The same pro-
cess  is  repeated  for 𝑆𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑟2.  Both  the  CC-gateways  authenticate  the  received  data 
and forward it to their connected servers for evaluation.  

The energy consumed by both the N nodes and ES nodes in transmitting a message 
(𝐸𝑇) is the summation of energy consumed by their power amplifier (𝐸𝐴) and it is a 
function of distance from which the message is sent, baseband DSP circuit (𝐸𝐵) and 
front-end  circuit  (𝐸𝐹) .  The  energy  consumed  in  receiving  a  message  (𝐸𝑅)  is  the 
summation of 𝐸𝐵, 𝐸𝐹 and the energy consumed by Low-Noise Amplifier 𝐸𝐿.

Simulation Results 

In this section, a smart grid network of IEEE 118-Bus system is considered. The total 
network region is divided into 8 regions and the power grid is divided into 107 substa-
tions. Substation 61 is selected as the main  CC and it consists of 3 buses─68,69 and 
116. Substation 16, consisting of buses─17 and 30, is selected as the backup CC. The 
main CC is in region 1 and the backup CC is in region 2 of the smart grid. In order to 
analyze  the  performance  of  SERMT  in  this  network  setup,  a  total  of  500  N  type 
nodes, 300 ES type nodes and 8 PDCs (high quality EHSNs with longer communica-
tion  range)  are  deployed  in  the  network  area  and  simulation  is  performed  using 
NS2.29 network simulator. The simulation results are compared with the Lo-ADI [1] 
technique  that  incorporates  a  secure  token  exchange  mechanism  among  the  WSN 
nodes. The simulation parameters are given in table.1.

et drop percentage 

In Fig.2, the average battery power consumed per hour by all types of sensor nodes 
is shown for different attack intervals in both Lo-ADI and SERMT. It is observed that 
the average battery power consumption of SERMT is a little higher than that of Lo-
ADI and this battery power consumption does not decrease if the attack interval is 1 
second  as  in  Lo-ADI  due  to  connection  revoke  and  packet  drops,  rather  its  battery 
power consumption increase if the attack interval is less as SERMT immediately adds 
the  malicious  node  into  its  threat  list  and  resends  the  packet  to  some  other  trusted 
node. Moreover, due to the presence of  ESs, the average residual energy in the  net-
work will always be more than that of Lo-ADI. In Fig.3, it is proved that even though 

  
 
SERMT consumes more power than that of Lo-ADI because of using several power 
consuming security mechanism computations and key exchange protocols, it wins in 
terms  of  offering  security  to  the  smart  grid.  Fig.3.  shows,  percentage  of  packets 
dropped in presence of different number of malicious nodes in the network and it is 
observed that in SERMT, the packet drop percentage is much lesser than that of Lo-
ADI even when there are 35 malicious nodes in the network.

Conclusion and Future Works 

The region based remote monitoring adopted by SERMT helps in easy identification 
of a failure in the power grid or an attack in the communication network of the smart 
grid. Security of sensor data is of utmost importance in the smart grid as any altera-
tion of the data can lead to wrong decision by the operator and this might badly harm 
the  smart  grid.  Data  privacy  is  obtained  in  SERMT  by  the  encryption/decryption 
mechanisms, data  integrity is verified by the hashed message authentication and au-
thentication of data is done by the one-way hash chain, therefore all the data security 
measures are addressed by SERMT. One drawback of SERMT is that it cannot deliv-
er the sensor data from the sensors to the control centers in a very short time due to 
the security measures it follows and this can be explored in future research how the 
time delay be reduced in a secure communication technique for smart grid. Designing 
a  threat  model  with  attacks  on  MUs,  PMUs,  gateways  or  servers  and  analyzing  the 
effect of cyber-attacks on power grid can be another direction of future work.
