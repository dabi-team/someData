Cybersecurity breaches are the common anomalies for distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, the cyber security breach

classification is still a difficult problem, even using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. In this paper, we study the

multi-class classification problem in cyber security for attack detection. A challenging multi-node data-censoring case is considered.

In such a case, data within each data center/node cannot be shared while the local data is incomplete. Particularly, local nodes contain

only a part of the multiple classes. In order to train a global multi-class classifier without sharing the raw data across all nodes, the

main result of our study is designing a multi-node multi-class classification ensemble approach. By gathering the estimated parameters

of the binary classifiers and data densities from each local node, the missing information for each local node is completed to build

the global multi-class classifier. Numerical experiments are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under the

multi-node data-censoring case. Under such a case, we even show the out-performance of the proposed approach over the full-data

approach.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past few decades, collecting and storing data in multiple local data centers/nodes rather than one single node

has become more common in various areas due to the fast-developing technologies in data collection and processing

[1–8]. Such multi-node data then brings challenging environments in data analysis and integration [6, 9], and has a

higher risk of being attacked by hackers [10, 11]. As a result, cyber security problems have gained more attention in

many fields, such as the autonomous driving system [12, 13], the AI-assisted diagnosis and treatment system [14, 15],

and the Internet of Things (IoT) system [11, 16, 17]. In cyber security problems, attack detection is of particular interest

[10, 11]. There are a large number of works done for attack detection in the field of cyber security. Aitor Belenguer et al.

[18] review applications of Federated Learning in Intrusion Detection. They introduce the development of intrusion

detection systems and works including centralized learning, federated learning, and FEDAVG algorithm. They discuss

the limitation of current works and future technologies. Many of the reviewed works associate the intrusion detection

problem with the classification problem. Besides, [19] compare various machine learning methods for intrusion detection

systems, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. They discuss both binary

classification and multi-class classification scenarios according to the IoT-23 dataset. Classification problems play an

important role in intrusion detection systems since different types of attacks could be seen as different classes. And

among all the aforementioned attack-detection approaches, one of the main tasks is multi-class classification.

Fig. 1. Illustrations of existing multi-node multi-class classification approaches. Data in each local node only contains one type of
attack. Based on the local data, only the binary classifiers can be obtained, denoted as 𝑐1, 𝑐2 and 𝑐3. Our goal is to obtain the global
classifier 𝑐.

Although extensive approaches have been developed for federated or decomposition multi-class classification in

the past few years, most of the approaches require either of the following assumptions. (1) Data in each local node

contains complete information for the multi-class classification, i.e., each node contains all classes of data so that a

multi-class classifier can be calculated within each local node [20, 21], and then the global classifier can be obtained

through a federated average. (2) Data are shared across all local nodes so that the multi-class classifier can be obtained

by either the one-vs-all decomposition scheme or the one-vs-one decomposition scheme, i.e., the multi-class classifier

is obtained through an ensemble of multiple binary classifiers [22–24]. Figure 1 illustrates the two typical types of

existing approaches. Panel (a) in figure 1 shows the case in a federated approach, where assumption (1) is satisfied,

and the local nodes can only access their own data. Panel (b) and (c) in figure 1 show the cases for an one-vs-all

and an one-vs-one decomposition approach, respectively. In these cases, assumption (2) is satisfied. However, such

assumptions may not hold in real-world applications. For example, in disease screening studies, data collected from a

basic medical center may only contain records from normal people and mild patients. On the other hand, in specialist

hospitals, the majority of the records are from severe patients and critically ill patients. Such cases are also popular in

intrusion-detection studies in IoT. In such studies, different attackers may affect different parts of the network, and

carry out different types of attacks. As a result, within a certain node, there may only exist one typical type of attack

[25, 26]. We now consider a toy example illustrated in figure 2. Suppose there are three local nodes connected to a

central node. Within each node, there exists normal data, shown as the green signals. There also exist three types of

attackers, each of which is specified for a different local node. The attacked data is shown as the blue, red, and black

signals, respectively. In such cases, information in each local node is incomplete, we thus call the local nodes “censoring

nodes”. Because of the data censoring, each local node can only train classifiers for its existing classes based on its

data, such as the three local classifiers shown in figure 2. However, in real-world applications, no one can guarantee

that data from the missing classes will never appear in the future. For such data, the pre-trained classification model

fails. The information for the missing classes needs to be obtained to compensate for the classification failure for local

nodes and to obtain a global/complete classifier. One naive approach is pooling data from different nodes together

to obtain the global multi-class classifier for all classes. However, in practice, data privacy and communication cost

are crucial concerns. Sharing data across all nodes is infeasible [5, 6]. There is an urgent need to learn the missing

knowledge from other nodes without accessing their raw data. On the other hand, the data censoring is related to the

practical network structures and node features, it is unlikely to obtain information on all possible combinations of pairs

of classes. Therefore, the existing ensembling strategies described in [22–24] are also infeasible.

Our contributions. To combat the obstacles, we develop a novel multi-node multi-class classification ensemble

approach with a combination of local classification with density estimation for multi-node attack detection, especially

when data is censored within each local node. The approach is inspired by the ensemble learning approaches which

integrate weak learners obtained in each local node to build a strong learner. Similarly, in the proposed multi-node

multi-class classification ensemble approach, the “weak learners” can be regarded as the binary classifiers trained within

each node using the local data; and the “strong learner” is the final multi-class classifier. Unlike traditional ensemble

learning approaches, in which the local tasks within each node are based on full data, in the proposed approach, the

local tasks are some “partial” tasks of the global multi-class classification task based on the censored local data. By

combining local classification and density estimation, we obtain the informative parameter estimations for each class.

We then complete the missing information of unobserved classes for each local node through communication with such

estimations. The completed missing information can help each local node defend against potential attacks in the future,

even if such types of attacks have not appeared in the past. In addition, we show the proposed method is not specific

to the attack detection problems. It is potentially suitable for general multi-class classification problems under data

censoring with different types of data structures. In general, we summarize the contribution of the paper from three

aspects.

(1) We propose a novel multi-node multi-class classification problem setting with censoring local nodes.

(2) We discuss several data/class censoring structures that are common in real-world applications.

(3) We propose an ensemble approach to aggregate local binary classifiers into a global multi-class classifier that is

suitable for censoring nodes without sharing local data.

(4) The one-shot ensemble and the flexibility in the assumption of data structure make it possible to extend

the proposed approach to a general multi-node multi-class classification problem under a federated learning

framework.

always represents the control group, and 𝑦 = 1, . . . , 𝑀 represent 𝑀 case groups. Another example is the Intrusion
Detection System study, where 𝑦 = 0 represents normal/un-attacked records and 𝑦 = 1, . . . , 𝑀 represent 𝑀 attacks. Let
M 𝑗 ⊂ {0, 1, . . . , 𝑀 } be the subset of classes exist in Node𝑗 . When we consider the classification problem within a single

where the function 1(𝑦𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑚) is the indicator function that equals 1 when 𝑦𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑚, otherwise 0.

2.2 Ensemble multi-node multi-class classification

Recall that in federated approaches, M 𝑗 = {0, 1, . . . , 𝑀 }, thus the loss function for a global multi-class classification
problem is simply a summation of all the loss functions of the local multi-class classification problems. It is easy to
see that the global multi-class classifier can be obtained through a combination of all local 𝑐 𝑗 ’s. On the other hand,
in decomposition approaches, even though 𝑐 𝑗 ’s within each local node are binary classifiers, the shared data and the
complete information between one class to all other classes make it possible to expand the binary 𝑐 𝑗 ’s to a global
multi-class classifier. However, we consider the cases when the local nodes are censoring nodes. Typically, we focus

on the cases when each local node only contains data in two classes. For example, if we follow the attack detection
problem setting illustrated in figure 2, we assume within each local node, there exists un-attacked data (𝑦 = 0) together
with only one type of attack data (𝑦 = 𝑚, 𝑚 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑀 }). According to the proposed data-censoring setting, 𝑐 𝑗 ’s within
each local node are binary one-vs-one classifiers. The access to the information of the unobserved classes for each

local node is prevented by its censored data and the lack of enough pair-wise binary classifiers. Without the complete

pair-wise information for all possible combinations of classes, it is challenging to obtain a feasible and effective global

multi-class classifier based on the aggregation of limited local classifiers, especially when local data are not allowed to

be shared. We thus need to extract more features from the local data, other than the estimated parameters for local

classifiers, to communicate across all nodes so that the local nodes can complete their missing information.

It is obvious that the global multi-class classifier 𝑐 (0), . . . , 𝑐 (𝑚) for classes 0, 1, . . . , 𝑀 depends on the information of
the following two aspects: (1) the information of the response label 𝑦 for all classes, i.e. 𝑃 (𝑦 = 𝑚) for 𝑚 = 0, 1, . . . , 𝑀, and
(2) the information of the predictor 𝒙 for all classes. In each local node, we lack both of the aforementioned information

for the missing classes. We thus need to borrow information from other nodes to fill in the missing parts. Intuitively,
the information of the response label 𝑃 (𝑦 = 𝑚) can be provided from the local classifiers 𝑐 (𝑚)
’s, and the information
of 𝒙 is obtained by integrating the local density estimation of 𝒙𝑖 𝑗 in each node. Specifically, the global classifier 𝑐 (𝑚)
can be regarded as a summation of conditional probabilities 𝑃 (𝑦 = 𝑚, data ∈ Node𝑗 |𝒙) for 𝑗 = 1, . . . , 𝐽 . In addition,
when the probability 𝑃 (data ∈ Node𝑗 ) and the distribution of 𝒙 in 𝑗-th node are given, the conditional probability
𝑃 (𝑦 = 𝑚, data ∈ Node𝑗 |𝒙) is proportional to 𝑃 (𝑦 = 𝑚|data ∈ Node𝑗 , 𝒙), which is the local classifier 𝑐 (𝑚)
. Motivated by
this intuition, letting 𝑓 ( 𝑗)
𝑁 = 𝑃 (data ∈ Node𝑗 ), 𝑗 = 1, 2, . . . , 𝐽 , we derive
the ensembling of local classifiers as

3 ILLUSTRATION OF CONCEPT

In this section, we use some examples to illustrate the proposed problem setting and approach. Particularly, we consider

three typical structures for censoring local nodes. We then apply the proposed ensemble approach to both simulated

examples and real-world datasets under each structure. The experiments were conducted in Python using a Windows

computer with 16GB of memory and an 8 core CPU.

3.1 Simulated illustration

In this section, we use a simulated toy example to illustrate the proposed approach. Consider data with four classes
(𝑀 = 3). Suppose the data for Class 𝑚 comes from a mixture distribution of 𝐾𝑚 Gaussian components with mean 𝝁𝑘,𝑚
and covariance matrix Σ𝑘,𝑚, and each component is mixed with weight 𝜋𝑘,𝑚. The specific parameter settings are listed
in table 1.

We show the effectiveness of the proposed method through examples under three typical settings of data structure,

which are detailed as follows.

I (The “star” structure) Consider there are three nodes (𝐽 = 3). Data {𝒙, 𝑦} within node 𝑗 comes from Class 0

and Class 𝑗, i.e., 𝑦 ∈ {0, 𝑗 }, 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3.

II (The “ring” structure) Consider there are four nodes (𝐽 = 4). Data {𝒙, 𝑦} within node 𝑗 comes from Class 𝑗 − 1

and Class 𝑗, i.e., 𝑦 ∈ { 𝑗 − 1, 𝑗 }, 𝑗 = 1, . . . , 4, where we define “𝑦 = 4” is equivalent to “𝑦 = 0”.

III (The “fully-connected” structure) Consider there are six nodes (𝐽 = 6). Within node 𝑗, we generate data
{𝒙, 𝑦} with 𝑦 ∈ { 𝑗1, 𝑗2}, 𝑗 = 1, . . . , 6, where { 𝑗1, 𝑗2} is one of all the possible combinations of 0, 1, 2, and 3, with
𝑗1 ≠ 𝑗2.

We applied the proposed method to the simulated training data. For the first setting, we generated 14500, 13500, and

14500 samples within each node. Figure 3 shows the result of density estimation within each node. In figure 3, the left,

middle, and right columns each represent one single node respectively. The upper row shows the scree-plots of the
likelihood scores. Based on the scree-plots, we chose the number of Gaussian components within each node to be 𝐾 = 3.
The bottom row of figure 3 visualizes the ground truth and estimated densities. We see that the generated samples from

the estimated density (shown as the red “+”s) perfectly match the samples generated from the true density (shown as

the gray dots). Such an observation indicates the effectiveness of the density estimation through GMM. Similarly, based

on the scree-plots of the likelihood scores, we chose 𝐾 = 3, 2, 2, 3 for each node in the second setting, respectively, and
𝐾 = 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3 for each node in the third setting, respectively.

Fig. 3. Screeplot of the likelihood score for each node in the first setting.

After the density estimation through GMM, we applied the logistic regression model to the local data to build the

binary classifier for each local node. Finally, we aggregated the estimated parameters of all local binary classifiers and

the local densities to construct the global multi-class classifier as in EMMC algorithm 1.

We generated 100, 150, 100, and 150 samples from Class 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, as the test data. We then carried

out the classification tasks for the testing data under each of the settings. Specifically, we calculated both the precision

and recall values defined as follows:

and

Precision =

TruePositive
TruePositive + FalsePositive

,

Recall =

TruePositive
TruePositive + FalseNegative

.

The results are listed in table 2. The values outside the brackets are the mean precision and recall based on 50 replicates,

and the values within the brackets are the corresponding standard deviations. From table 2, we observe that under all

three settings of data structure, the proposed method can provide a proper multi-class classifier with a high accuracy

based on the binary classifiers provided by each local node.

In practice, the three types of structures may suitable for different scenarios. In the cases of attack detection, it is

is by nature the “star” structure. In the following section, the proposed approach was applied to two real-world

attack-detection datasets for further illustration.

3.2 An example for the NUSW-NB15 dataset

UNSW-NB15 is a dataset for cyber security research provided by [29]. The dataset contains normal/un-attacked data

and data of nine types of attacks: Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode, and
Worms. Denote the nine types of attacks as 𝑦 = 1, . . . , 9, respectively. We applied the proposed multi-node multi-class
classification ensemble approach to see if the nine classes with 𝑦 = 1, . . . , 9 and the normal data (𝑦 = 0) can be identified.
Besides the training data, UNSW-NB15 also provides a test dataset. Recall that the proposed approach is based on the

estimation of the data distribution, so a basic assumption is that there exists no distribution drift between the training

and test data. However, in practice, whether there exists a distribution drift between the training data and the testing

data is unknown. We thus need to consider a hypothesis testing for the distribution drift first. Denote the distribution
of the training data and the testing data as 𝑝𝑇 𝑟
𝒙 and
𝒙 can be measured by the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence 𝐾𝐿(𝑝𝑇 𝑟

𝒙 ) = 0; 𝐻𝑎 : 𝐾𝐿(𝑝𝑇 𝑟

𝐻0 : 𝐾𝐿(𝑝𝑇 𝑟

𝒙 ∥𝑝𝑇 𝑒

𝒙 ) > 0.

Notice 𝐾𝐿(𝑝𝑇 𝑟
𝒙 ∥𝑝𝑇 𝑒
𝒙 ) is calculated based on the true distributions, which are unobserved. We can only obtain the
estimation of 𝐾𝐿(𝑝𝑇 𝑟
𝒙 ∥𝑝𝑇 𝑒
𝒙 ), denoted as (cid:99)𝐾𝐿 from the observed samples. Moreover, the distribution of (cid:99)𝐾𝐿 under the null
hypothesis (the “null distribution”) can be complicated and difficult to parameterize. We thus applied the non-parametric
testing by obtaining the empirical null distribution of (cid:99)𝐾𝐿 through randomly splitting the pooled dataset of the training
and test data repeatedly, and calculating the (cid:99)𝐾𝐿s between the split datasets. We repeated the splitting 100 times and
calculated the proportion of the (cid:99)𝐾𝐿s being greater than the original one as the testing p-value. We also carried out the
hypothesis testing on each class separately, and the results are listed in table 3. From the results, we can see that there

is a significant distribution drift between the training and test data. Specifically, the differences is significant in the

normal data and the data of attack Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoor, and Generic. Therefore, we only use the given training

dataset in the experiment.

Since the proposed approach is based on an ensemble of the local classifiers, we need to check the sample size of

each type of attack to see if it is enough to obtain a good local classifier. The sample size for each type of attack is

listed in table 4. We observe that for the attack “Worms”, there are only 44 records, which is too small compared to

the rest of attacks. Thus we abandoned it in the experiment. Moreover, data balancing is also important for training

a good classifier. However, the dataset at hand highly skewed. Therefore, we balanced each type of attacks using

the following strategy: if the sample size of the attack is less than 1000, we keep the data untouched; if the sample

size is greater than 1000, we randomly pick out 1000 representatives. Note that NUSW-NB15 is a dataset for attack
detection, so we considered the “star” structure, i.e. there are nine local nodes (J=9), and data {𝒙, 𝑦} within node 𝑗

satisfies 𝑦 ∈ {0, 𝑗 }, 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 8. Again, to ensure the balance between the normal and the attacked data within each local
node, we sub-sampled the normal data according to the sample size of each type of attack, and assigned them to all the

nodes.

We randomly picked 75% of the pre-processed dataset to train the proposed classifier, and used the remaining 25% as

the testing set. We calculated the precision and recall of each class in the testing dataset for both the balanced data and

the original imbalanced data (with “Worms” deleted) to see the effect of the data balancing. The comparison is shown in

figure 4. Panel (a) shows the precisions and panel (b) shows the recalls. The yellow lines are the proportion of each

class in the training data, with the dashed lines representing the imbalanced data and the solid lines representing the

balanced data. The sample size for Class 0 is a combination of all nodes, thus the proportion is greater than other classes.

We observe that after balancing, the lines become much flatter. The groups of bars represent the test precisions/recalls

of each class. The red/purple bars show the ensemble/full-data results for the balanced data, and the brown/blue bars

show the ensemble/full-data results for the imbalanced data. We can observe that even though the sample sizes become

smaller than the original ones for some classes after balancing, the results are much better than those of the imbalanced

data. Such an observation verifies the necessity of data balancing. We then focus on the balanced data from now on.

Fig. 4. Comparison of the testing precisions and recalls of the ensemble (EMMC)/full-data (Full) approaches for the imbalanced and
balanced data.

Similar to the simulated example, we plot the scree-plots of the likelihood score, and chose 𝐾 = 35 for the GMM in
each local node. For the local binary classifiers, we applied four commonly used machine learning approaches: Logistic

Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Naive Bayes with Gaussian (NB). After 50

replicates, the testing precisions and recalls for each class are listed in table 5. The results show that the proposed

approach is feasible and effective when the training dataset is balanced.

3.3 An example for The EdgeIIoT dataset

In [31], a new comprehensive and realistic cyber security dataset of IoT and IIoT, dubbed Edge-IIoT, is introduced.

The dataset is constructed for machine-learning-based intrusion detection systems. Twelve attack scenarios, namely

"Backdoor" , "DDoS-HTTP" , "DDoS-ICMP" , "DDoS-TCP" , "DDoS-UDP" , "Password" , "Port-Scanning" ,"Ransomware",
"SQL-injection" , "Uploading" , "Vulnerability-scanner" and "XSS", are covered in the dataset (𝑀 = 12). We denote the
response label as 𝑦 = 1, . . . , 12 for each attack, respectively. Similar to the previous example, we consider the “star”
structure: in the 𝑗-th node, we consider a binary classification task for 𝑦 = 0 (the normal data) and 𝑦 = 𝑗.

We randomly picked 75% of the dataset to train the classifiers and used the remaining 25% as the testing set. Again,

we observe that the attacked data are imbalanced for different classes, such skewness lowers the accuracy of the local

classifiers, as shown in figure 5. To balance the dataset, we randomly selected 1000 normal data and 1000 attacked data

for each node. Based on the scree-plots of the log-likelihood scores, the number of Gaussian components in GMM were
set to be 𝐾 = 15. For local binary classifiers, we applied the machine learning approaches support vector machine (SVM),
k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) as in [31]. Averaged over 50 replicates, the

precisions and recalls for each class are listed in table 6. The results again support the feasibility and effectiveness of

the proposed approach.

When dealing with general multi-class classification problems, such as classification for digital numbers (e.g. the

MNIST dataset), we have no obvious justification on assuming a “star” structure any more. The other two structures

(“ring” and “fully-connected”), or some structures (e.g., each node containing two classes randomly) are also possible.

For simplicity, we focus on the “star” structure of real-world datasets for attack detection in the following sections. We

refer to Appendix B for general classification problems with the “ring” and “fully-connected” structures.

4 AN ANALYSIS OF THE MQTT PROTOCOL-BASED DATASET

Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is one of the most commonly used protocol in IoT [32, 33].
We consider the dataset provided by [34], which is the first simulated dataset under MQTT protocol 1. In this dataset,
four different types of attacks are considered: Aggressive scan (Scan-A), User Datagram Protocol (UDP) scan (Scan-sU),
Sparta SSH brute-force (Sparta), and MQTT brute-force attack (MQTT-BF). Therefore, we have 𝑀 = 4, with 𝑦 = 1, 2, 3, 4
indicating the Scan-A, Scan-sU, Sparta, and MQTT-BF attacks, respectively. Besides the multi-class dataset, datasets

for each type of attack are also provided. We call such datasets the “binary” datasets. Each binary dataset contains

records for the normal data and one certain type of attack. Moreover, among the simulated packet-based features,

unidirectional-based features, and bidirectional-based features, we focus on the bidirectional-based features, which can

provide the highest classification accuracy in previous related works in the experimental studies.

4.1 Feature subspace for each type of attacks

We first try to understand the mechanism of each type of attack by extracting the “feature subspace” for each type

of attack. Here we refer to the subspace spanned by certain linear combinations of original features as the “feature

subspace”, which differs most between the attacked and normal data.

4.1.1

Feature subspace extracting. To extract the feature subspace, we applied the principal optimal transport direction

(POTD) approach [35]. We summarize the POTD approach as follows. Firstly, an optimal transport plan [36–39] is
calculated between the attack data 𝒙 |𝑦 = 𝑚, 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3, 4 and the normal data 𝒙 |𝑦 = 0. Secondly, a “displacement matrix”
𝑃𝑚,0, 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3, 4, which represents the empirical transport plan from 𝒙 |𝑦 = 𝑚 to 𝒙 |𝑦 = 0, is used to measure the
difference between the attack and normal data. POTD approach then extracts the major directions of 𝑃𝑚,0 using the
principal component analysis (PCA). The major directions, denoted as 𝐵𝑚, 𝑚 = 1, 2, 3, 4, are proved to be the directions
that differ most between the attack and normal data. The feature subspace for each type of attack is defined as the
subspace spanned by 𝐵𝑚.

Based on the scree-plots for the PCA of 𝑃𝑚,0 shown in figure 6, the first four principal components can explain over
90% of the information of the original matrix 𝑃𝑚,0. We thus set the dimension for direction matrix 𝐵𝑚 to be 𝑑 = 4, for
all 𝑚 = 1, . . . , 4. The direction matrices for the four types of attacks are shown in figure 7. From the figure, we observe

that the feature subspaces are specified for different types of attacks. We further study the specificity of the feature

subspaces using more statistical tools.

4.1.2

Specificity of feature subspaces. We show the specificity of the four extracted feature subspaces by comparing

the distributions of the Wasserstein distances [36–39] between the attack and normal data after projecting data onto

each feature subspace. Specifically, we obtain the empirical distributions as follows,

(1) Randomly sample 1000 attacked samples and 1000 normal samples from the four binary datasets.

(2) Project the random samples onto each feature subspace.

(3) Calculate the Wasserstein distance between the projected attack and normal samples.

(4) Repeat steps (1)-(3) for 100 times.

Intuitively, if the extracted feature subspaces are specified for the corresponding attack types, we expect that the

empirical distribution of the Wasserstein distance between the attacked data and the normal data after projecting

onto the corresponding feature subspace will be clearly separated from those projected onto all other subspaces. The

histograms for the Wasserstein distances are shown in Figure 8. From the figure, we observe that it’s clear that after
projecting, the Wasserstein distances between the 𝑚-th attack and the normal data in the feature subspace spanned by
𝐵𝑚 are significantly larger than others (𝑚 = 1, 2, 3, 4). Such an observation matches the aforementioned intuition. It
verifies the specificity of the four extracted feature subspaces.

4.2 Attack detection

The specificity shown above implies that the four types of attacks may be under different mechanisms. As a result,

attack detection using a multi-class classification approach becomes more feasible. Similar to the data pre-processing

in [40], we excluded the IP addresses and protocol from the datasets. We considered each binary dataset as a node in

the experimental studies. In other words, we considered the “star” structure as in the previous simulation studies and

real-world data illustrations. In such a structure, there are four nodes (J = 4). Each node only contains information to

identify one of the Scan-A, Scan-sU, Sparta, and MQTT-BF attacks.

Fig. 9. Screeplots of the log-likelihood scores for data in four nodes.

Based on the scree-plots of the log-likelihood score shown in figure 9, we chose 𝐾 = 15 in GMM when estimating
the local data density for all nodes. We then calculated the binary classifiers within each node based on the remaining

28 bidirectional-based features (we refer to [40] for the detailed description of each feature). We applied the logistic

regression (LR), the random forests (RF), and the support vector machine with RBF kernel (SVM) to build the local

binary classifiers. Again, 75% of the data within each local node were randomly picked as the training data for obtaining

the local binary classifiers. The remained data for all nodes were pooled together as the multi-class testing data. We

compared the testing precisions and recalls for the multi-class classifiers obtained through the proposed ensemble

approach and the full-data approach. The results are listed in table 7. The values outside the brackets are the mean

precision and recall based on 50 replicates, and the values within the brackets are the corresponding standard deviations.

From the table, we observe that the ensemble approach performs similarly to the full-data approach for all three

classification models. Such an observation validates the feasibility of the ensemble approach, which can indeed obtain

the global multi-class classifier while data in each node is incomplete.

4.3 Classification with Dimension Reduction

In the previous experiment, we applied the proposed approach on the original dataset with a dimension of 28. However,

based on the studies on the feature subspaces for each type of attack, we observe that the attacks are specified on only

four dimensions. To show the utility of the proposed approach, we conducted a dimension reduction via Principal

Component Analysis (PCA), and reduced the data dimension from 28 to four. Again, four binary classification algorithm,

namely Logistic Regression(LR), Random Forest(RF), k Nearest Neighborhood(kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM)

were adopted for the task after dimension reduction, and the results are listed in table 8.

Since the Support Vector Machine method for full-data is super time-consuming compared with other methods, we

did not report the results for SVM under the full-data case. According to the results, when applying Logistic Regression

for classification, the proposed multi-node multi-class classification ensemble approach has a higher Precision compared

with the full-data approach. One possible reason is that after processing data via PCA, data may become much more

dense, the linear classifier (LR) may not be suitable for the multi-class classification. However, it may still be suitable for

the simple binary classification within a single node. In addition, GMM may also results in a more accurate density

estimation for a dense data with less dimension than for a high-dimensional data. As a result, the proposed approach

performs better than the full-data approach with LR.

5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we study the federated learning framework for multi-class classification. We focus on the cases when local

nodes only contain a certain part of the classes. By filling in the missing information through gathering the parameters

from local binary classifiers and local densities, we develop a multi-node multi-class classification ensemble approach.

We validate the feasibility of the proposed approach both theoretically and practically. We also discuss the impact

of data balancing. Actually, there are some existing weighted binary classification approaches for imbalanced data

[41, 42]. When we adopt such weighted approaches to the local classifiers, the proposed ensemble approach can be

potentially extended to a more general approach for imbalanced data. Furthermore, the proposed approach has three

interesting merits in aspects of communication complexity, privacy, and generality. Firstly, it’s one-shot in terms of

communication complexity [43, 44], in that it only requires one communication between the server and each client. In

contrast, conventional federated learning algorithms require iterative communications, which is time-consuming and

demands that different clients must be synchronized. Thanks to the density estimator, our algorithm is further free from

the need for a global public dataset or synthetic data generation/distillation, which are required by existing one-shot

federated learning approaches [45, 46]. Secondly, the proposed approach does not transmit gradient information, which

makes it intrinsically immune to common attack strategies in decentralized machine learning such as the gradient

inversion attack [47]. Thirdly, the proposed approach is general enough that all sorts of classifiers and density estimators

can be incorporated to replace the currently used binary classifiers and GMM models. This allows one to borrow

cutting-edge techniques from deep learning or even quantum machine learning communities, such as more advanced

neural networks or quantum circuits as classifiers and modern generative models as density estimators [48, 49].

B APPLICATION ON MNIST DATASET

MNIST [50] is a popular image dataset with 60,000 samples that contains 10 classes of handwritten digits from 0 to

9. In such a dataset, there is no obvious justification for the particular “star” structure. We thus additionally consider

the “ring” and “fully-connected” structures. We randomly pick 75% of the data within each node to train the local

binary classifiers. We then combine the remained data (25% for each node) together as the multi-class test data. We use

the random forest (RF) as the binary classifiers. We compare the test precision and recall of the multi-class classifiers

obtained through the proposed ensemble approach and the full-data approach. Here the “full-data approach” refers

to the classifier trained with the pooled data. The results averaged over 50 replicates are listed in table 9. The values

outside the brackets are the mean precision and recall based, and the values within the brackets are the corresponding

standard deviations. From the table, we observe that the ensemble approach under the “fully-connected” structure is

slightly better than the “ring” structure. Such an observation is expected since the “fully-connected” structure contains

more mutual information among classes. We also observe that the ensemble approach performs similarly to the full-data

approach. Such an observation validates the feasibility and effectiveness of the federated approach.
