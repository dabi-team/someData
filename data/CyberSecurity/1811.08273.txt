Abstract—  Security  is  a  primary  concern  for  the  networks 
aiming at the utilization of Cellular (C) services for connecting 
Vehicles to Everything (V2X). At present, C-V2X is observing 
a paradigm shift from Long Term Evolution (LTE)  – Evolved 
Universal  Terrestrial  Radio  Access  Network  (E-UTRAN)  to 
Fifth Generation (5G) based functional architecture.  However, 
security  and  credential  management  are  still  concerns  to  be 
resolved under 5G-V2X. A sizably voluminous  number of  key 
updates and non-availability of sub-functions at the edge cause 
adscititious  overheads  and  decrement  the  performance  while 
alarming  the  possibilities  of  variants  of  cyber  attacks.  In  this 
paper,  security  management  is  studied  as  a  principle  of 
sustainability and its tradeoff is evaluated with the number of 
key-updates required to maintain an authenticated connection 
of  a  vehicle  to  the  5G-terminals  keeping  intact  the  security 
functions  at  the  backhaul.  A  numerical  study  is  presented  to 
determine the claims and understand the proposed tradeoff.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

the  edge 

With  the  availability  of  new  radio  access  technologies, 
provisioning different types of services across the  Cellular-
Vehicle  to  Everything  (C-V2X)  is  seen  as  the  forefront  of 
5G networks [1] [2] [3]. This has been dominatingly termed 
as  5G-V2X  where  the  core  security  and  general  functions 
are  considered  for  facilitating  the  security  and  services  for 
vehicles involved in the formation of the Vehicle to Vehicle 
(V2V),  Vehicle  to  Infrastructure  (V2I)  and  Vehicle  to 
Pedestrian  (V2P)  networks  as  a  part  of  V2X.  Connecting 
fronthaul  entities  to  the  network  and  ensuring  much  of  the 
operations  at 
require  specific  divisibility 
phenomenon  which  can  simultaneously  acquire  as  well  as 
manage the backhaul operations [3] [4].  
   Most  of  the  existing  studies  have  presented  this  as  a 
resource  allocation  problem  [5]  [6].  However,  there  is  no 
evident  study  available  which  aims  at  providing  a  strategic 
management of  security  for 5G-V2X  while considering  the 
appropriate  security  for  the  backhaul  formed  between  the 
Terminal  (TM)  and  the  hub  as  a  part  of  the  basic 
architecture.    The  initial  reports  on  5G  have  provided  a 
specific  security  function  architecture  which  can  be 
integrated with the required base model as well as a security 
protocol 
the 
transmissions  [2]  [7].  Initially,  5G-Authentication  and  Key 
Agreement  (AKA)  protocol  and  Extensible  Authentication 
Protocol  (EAP)-AKA  prime  are  seen  as  competitive 
solutions  for  authenticating  network  entities  [2].  However, 
the  initial  reports  do  not  confirm  the  overheads  associated 
with  the  periodic  key  updates,  mobility  management  of 
vehicles,  as  well  as  the  sustainability  of  V2X  against  a 
known  set  of  cyber  threats  [8][9].  Periodic  key  updates 
undoubtedly  enhance  the  security  of  a  network,  but  this

procedure,  in  the  case  of  limited  requirements,  causes  an 
uncertain  burden  on  the  entities  and  may  result  in  high 
computational  complexity  as  well  as  high  operational  cost 
[6]  [10].  Thus, 
the 
requirements  of  security  management  for  V2X  and  also 
considers  the  possibilities  of  sub-dividing  the  5G  security 
functions to make it suitable for handling operations as well 
as  authentication  procedures  of  V2X  at  a  high  rate  of 
sustainability with lesser key-updates. 
  The  remaining  part  of  this  article  is  organized  as  follows: 
Section II presents the problem statement and highlights our 
contribution.  Section  III  discusses  the  system  model.  The 
proposed  approach  is  presented  in  Section  IV.  Section  V 
covers  the  numerical  evaluations.  Finally,  Section  VI 
concludes the article. 

II.  PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OUR CONTRIBUTION 

to  users  raise  concerns  of 

Managing  security  for  backhaul-aware  5G-V2X  is  tedious 
as  it  depends  on  the  architectural  deployment  and  5G 
function-mappings to the underlaid network. Moreover, with 
a  key  focus  on  edge-initiation,  bringing  security-aspects 
near 
trustworthy  security 
facilitations,  especially  when  the  involved  entities  are 
vehicles. With varying mobility and high dynamics in V2V, 
V2I and V2P formations, management of security needs an 
efficient solution which can protect the network under major 
attack  scenarios.  In  this  paper,  the  key  exchange  passes 
between  the  vehicles  and  5G-security  functions,  which  are 
deployed on the core, hub and the switches, are considered. 
The article also considers the backhaul between the TM and 
the  hub  for  management  as  a  part  of  the  5G  deployment. 
The primary objective is to identify the time slots when the 
keys  should  be  updated  in  order  to  protect  the  network 
against  known  cyber  threats.  Alongside,  identification  of 
fail-safe  points  up  to  which  the  network  can  be  operated 
with  the  current  keys  is  to  be  determined.  Credential 
management,  and certifying the  key-hierarchy principles or 
enabling  edge-initiated  security  are  further  considered  as  a 
part  of  the  derived  optimization  problem.  It  should  be 
considered with an extreme importance that updating keys is 
a crucial part of the network which has to deal with a large 
number  of  applications.  Network  with  a  large  number  of 
key-updates can be secured up to much extent but at the cost 
of performance. Thus, this tradeoff needs to be balanced for 
attaining an efficient backhaul-aware 5G-V2X. Based on the 
solutions presented in this article, the core contributions can 
be marked as follows: 

  Dual  security  management  solution  is  presented 
that  considers  security  through  long-range  and 
short-range authentications. 

 
 
  A  fail-safe  point  is  identified  as  a  part  of  the 
optimization solution, until which, the network can 
be operated without changing the derived keys. 

  A  new  hierarchy  principle 

is  presented  for 
managing  key  derivations  from  the  5G  security 
functions.  

allocated  keys  can  be  safe  from  known  attacks.  Moreover, 
intermediate-key  updates,  Uk,  should  be  minimized  while 
maximizing  the  overall  sustainability,  SN,  of  the  network. 
Here,  SN is  derived  as  a  function  of  induced  overheads  by 
using IPAT formulations [11], such that

is the number of cars in the

number of passes between the entities, n is the sustainability

between  the  vehicles  and  the  entity  dealing  with  the 
particular request generated for a 5G security function (key 
or service requests), N is the end devices (vehicles, UEs, or 
users), and E is the overall involved entities. Now, based on 
the  above-discussed  security 
the  optimization 
problem can be formulated as:

III.  SYSTEM MODEL 

s.t. 

The  network  comprises  5G  security  functions  which  are 
mapped  across  the  core,  TMs,  switches,  User  Equipment 
(UE),  and  hubs,  as  shown  in  Fig.1.  The  UEs  involve  the 
vehicles  and  general  users  that  form  V2V,  V2I  and  V2P 
links during their operations.  The core involves the Access 
and Mobility Management Function (AMF), which operates 
together with the Session Management Function (SMF) and 
Policy  Control  Function  (PCF),  and  as  described  in  the 
initial  TS  by  3GPP  [2],  the  Security  Anchor  Function 
(SEAF) is placed in their periphery which is located deep in 
the  network  without  any  knowledge  to  the  edge  as  well  as 
vehicles. As it is tedious to consider such a deployment for 
supporting  edge-initiated  security  as  well  as  authentication 
for  V2X,  the  proposed  part  modifies  it  and  presents  a  new 
disintegrated  structure  to  make  the  5G-drafted  version 
suitable for V2X. SEAF keys and authentication are driven 
by  the  Authentication  Server  Function  (AUSF)  and  the 
Authentication  Credential  Repository  and  Processing 
Function (ARPF) [2].  
The  mmWave  backhaul  supports 
the  Unified  Data 
Management  (UDM),  Application  Function  (AF),  (Radio) 
Access Network ((R)-AN), and User Plane Function (UPF). 
In accordance with the problem statement, the issue is with 
the 
the  V2X 
authentication  and  TM  authentication  with  the  hub  along 
with  the  placement  of  major  details  at  the  edge  without 
costing  the  performance.  This  article  considers  security  to 
be  directly  proportional  to  the  number  of  key-updates 
performed  in  the  V2X  setup.    However,  with  an  excessive 
number  of  updates,  the  network  induces  certain  overheads, 
which slow down the operations and increase the burden of 
credential  management.  To  resolve  this,  at  first,  a  timing 
problem is formulated. According to which, let t be the time 
taken by an adversary to launch an attack, out of which t’ be 
the  minimum  time  for  which  the  keys  should  not  be 
changed.  
    Considering  this,  the  key-utilization  time,  tu,  must  be 
identified,  such  that  tu  <  t’  (<=t),  for  which  the  currently

IV.  PROPOSED APPROACH 

two  modes 

The  proposed  approach  establishes  a  security  management 
framework which operates as a dual security driving system 
based  on 
range 
authentication  and  short-range  authentication.  Both  these 
help  to  provide  a  strong  authentication  for  V2X  while 
ensuring  the  security  of  backhaul  between  the  TM  and  the 
for 
hub.  The  proposed  approach  maintains  a  plan

authentication  via  key  exchanges  that  are  performed  by 
utilizing the deployed 5G security functions. The long-range 
authentications are performed for  the  backhaul  whereas  the 
short-range  authentications  are  performed  for  the  edge-
initiated network formations. The initial mode is dependent 
on the derivations of keys from the core, which is a part of 
long-range  authentication  and  sub-division  of  initial  keys 
support  the  procedures  for  short-range  authentication.  The 
long-range  authentication  is  operated  over  a  powerful 
mmWave  communications,  which  can  be  facilitated  by 
existing  encryption  algorithms  and  can  be  motivated  to 
the  devices  are  deployed  or 
update 
reconfigured. However, the major issue prevails at the edge-
initiated  authentication  for  the  vehicles,  which  under  high 
dynamics, causes an additional burden of key-regenerations 
as  well  as  credential  management.  To  further  resolve  this 
issue,  a  factorized  module  is  considered  in  the  short-range 
authentication,  which  evaluates  the  speed  (S),  location  (L), 
last  updates  for  keys  (UT),  shared  sessions  (AS),  refreshing 
rate  of  keys  (FR),  total  keys  (TK),  zone  traversals  (ZT),  and 
associatively  (VA)  of  a  vehicle  to  generate  new  keys  or 
continue  with  the  existing  keys  while  maintaining  the 
conditions  stated  in  (2).    An  overview  of  the  proposed 
approach  with  key  dependencies  is  presented  in  Fig.2  with 
the description as follows: 

  The AMF function is sub-divided into the terminal 
function  (TM-F)  and  Hub  function  (HM-F)  that 
derive their keys from KOTK, which is derived from 
KAMF.  

  The  derived  keys  are  used  for  initial  long-range 
authentications  and  short-range  authentications. 
The  sub-derived  keys  are  used  for  authenticating 
vehicles'  fronthaul  to  the  edge  and  the  backhaul 
between the TM and the hub. 

  The  sub-derivative  functions  help  to  support  the 
intra- and inter-mode of secure communications in 
V2X by deriving their core operations from the 5G 
security functions. 

At  present,  the  details  of  internal  procedures  for  the 
proposed  framework  and  authentication  mechanisms  are 
omitted from the article and  prime  focus has been given to 
understand the sustainability of the backhaul-aware 5G-V2X 
under  the  given  constraints  of  key  updates.  These  can 
further be observed from the following results: 

Lemma-1:  SN is  divergent  if  the  initial  information  on  the 
key  generation  is  unavailable.  However,  in  the  case  of 
known  timestamps,  the  network  sustainability  can  be 
modeled  over  the  available  key  updates  and  vehicle 
movement, such that for instances t1 and t2:

which is the desired output.  

Lemma-2:  For  extreme  large  rates  of  key  exchanges  and 
vehicle dynamics, SN is convergent to a linear function under 
asymptotic observations. This can be further used to identify 
fail-safe points with high accuracy up to which the network 
can  be  operated  without  much  overheads  and  security 
breaches. 
Proof: In continuation from Lemma-1, the result in (6) can 
be  asymptotically  analyzed  for  evaluating  the  behavior  of 
the  curve  determining  the  sustainability  of  the  V2X  under 
given  constraints.  According  to  which,  if 𝛼 and 𝛽 increases 
to  a  larger  value,  the  (6)  reduces  to  a  linear  function,  such 
that  SN  can  be  evaluated  as  a  function  comprising  two

metrics, i.e. 𝑆𝑁 = 𝑓  
and  limits,  it  can  be  given  as 𝑆𝑁 =
case,  the  behavior  is  not  integrally  divergent  and  the 
network  can  be  evaluated  with  linear  timestamping.  Now, 
considering these observations, the  network  fail-safe points 
up  to  which  there  is  no  need  to  update  or  refresh  the  keys 
can be evaluated as:

Fig. 3 Network sustainability w.r.t. the number of protocol passes at 
different rates for incoming vehicles and the number of key updates.  

The  results  suggest  that  with  the  proposed  strategy,  it  is 
feasible to effectively trace the network activity and manage 
its security by keeping a check on unnecessary key updates. 
By  this,  significant  overheads  can  be  reduced  from  the 
network and the security can be provided at the edge while 
keeping a close associatively  with the  network-backhaul.  It 
is observed that the number of passes and key-updates used 
for  authentication  pose  a  significant 
the 
performance  as  well  as  the  security  of  the  network. 
Numerically,  the  results  vary  between  53.1%  and  84.9% 
compared  to  initial  observed  output  at  constant  arrival  and 
update  rates  for  vehicles  and  keys,  respectively,  with  a 
varying value of Q. It is evident that the sustainability of the 
network  can  be  enhanced  even  with  an  increase  in  the 
number of vehicles or key-updates by reducing the number 
of passes between the vehicle and the infrastructure. Thus, it 
is  important  to  carefully  select  the  authentication  protocol 
and  it  must  not  cause  excessive  signaling  overheads.  For 
this,  the  proposed  approach  leverages  on  the  divisibility  of
