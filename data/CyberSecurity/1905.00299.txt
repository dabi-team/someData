ABSTRACT 

Technology is an endless evolving expression in modern era, which increased security concerns and pushed 
us to create cyber environment. A National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) of a country reflects the state of 
that  country’s  cyber  strength  which  represents  the  aim  and  vision  of  the  cyber  security  of  a  country. 
Formerly,  researchers  have  worked  on  NCSS  by  comparing  NCSS  between  different  nations  for 
international collaboration and harmonization and some researchers worked on policy framework for their 
respective governments. However very insignificant attempts had been made to assess the strategic strength 
of  NCSS  of  Bangladesh  by  performing  cross  comparisons  on  NCSS  of  different  Nations.  Therefore,  the 
motive of this research is to evaluate the robustness of the existing cyber security strategy of Bangladesh in 
comparison with some of the  most technologically advanced countries in Asian continent and others like 
USA, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and India in order to keep the NCSS of Bangladesh up-to-date.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Internet has established itself as a fundamental and essential necessity for the life of the people 
and  for their  socio  economical  activities. Though  it  is  making  things  easier for  people  it’s  also 
bringing  new  emerging  risks.  Cyber-attacks  have  never  stopped  and  never  will,  instead  it’s 
increasing  exponentially.  Therefore,  every  country  requires  a  stable,  reliable  and  resilient  ICT 
infrastructure  [1].  A  weak  ICT  infrastructure  can  be  of  high  risk.  Utilizing  ICT,  any  interested 
party  expert  in  cyber  intelligence  can  exploit  classified  information  about  Government  and 
Industries with advanced technologies. The government of Bangladesh planned to achieve 7.2% 
GDP growth in the year 2016-2017 [2]. To touch the desired target ICT sector has an important 
role to play. Therefore, the existing cyber security strategy has a key role in the social, economic 
and  national  development  process  by  reducing  cyber  threats,  providing  economic  security, 
strengthening  national  resiliency,  political  imperativeness,  lawful  mandate,  protecting  state 
secrets, strengthening diplomacy increasing country image, etc. As the NCSS of Bangladesh was 
declared in 2014, it’s been high time to check the strategy if it is still up-to the task to deal with 
the  emerging  national  and international  threats.  Researchers  have  worked  on  different levels  of 
security  strategies to  improve  their respective  areas. Developed  countries  have  worked  on  their 
security  frameworks,  policies  both  in  international  and  national  perspective.  As  Bangladesh 
followed the ITU framework for the creation of NCSS, it can be considered that it has complied 
with  the  international  policies.  However,  very  insignificant  national  level  interest  to  check  the 
efficiency  of 
like  framework  analysis,  policy  analysis, 
implementation  state,  current  progress  etc.  Therefore,  this  research  is  an  attempt  to  find  the 
current  state  of  the  NCSS  of  Bangladesh  by  comparing  the  strategy  with  some  countries  of 
different technological progress level like USA, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and find some 
insights through the comparison to improve the strategy.  

the  NCSS  has  been  noticed

The  organization  of  chapters  is  as  followings.  After  the  introduction  in  the  first  chapter,  the 
second chapter describes the background of this study, and literature review in the next chapter. 
After  that,  methodology  of  this  research  has  been  specified  with  the  mention  of  comparison 
criteria  which  have  identified  as  the  effective  comparison  criteria  to  compare  a  cyber-security 
strategies.  In  the  next  chapter  findings  and  analysis  is  done  which  shows  the  cross  section 
analysis of the strategies of specific countries based on the comparison criteria. Then results from 
the findings have been discussed with some recommendations and finally the conclusion has been 
drawn with the notion of future work.  

2. BACKGROUND 

In  this  decade  the  number  of  Internet  user  has  increased  exponentially.  It’s  happening  to  the 
whole globe. From underdeveloped to developing and developed country, every single country is 
now  bested  with  the  blessing  and  curse  of  the  technology.  It’s  increasing  and  along  with  this, 
cyber-attacks  are  also  getting  more  advanced  and  complex.  To  make  things  worse,  unlike  the 
federal crimes, it’s not restricted to specific country, it’s beyond border. Thus, it’s more likely to 
remain undetected if proper infrastructure is not there to fight it. Bangladesh government’s vision 
is  to  transform  helself  into  a  digital  one.  That  suggests  more  and  more  involvement  with 
technology. Previously there have been a good number of cyber- attacks on her cyber space. In 
2012,  26  government  organizations  were  hacked.  In  2013  one  government  bank  (Sonali  Bank) 
was under attack and the hackers were able to cart away US$250,000 without making any fuss 
[3]. In 2015 the web sites of Bangladesh police and the Rapid Action Battalion (An Elite force) 
were  hacked  February  6  2015  [4].  These  are  a  few  as  examples.  However,  the  threat  of  cyber 
intelligence  was  mainly  triggered  by  the  2016  Central  Bank  heist.  It  was  one  of  the  world’s 
biggest  bank  heist  of  cybercrime  history.  They  were  able  to  steal  $101  million  from  the 
Bangladesh bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York through the SWIFT network 
[5]. Later it was found that Dridex (A banking Trojan) was used in this heist [6]. 

The Cyber security strategy of Bangladesh was launched on 2014. And its mission is to protect 
the  cyber  world  against  security  threats,  risks  and  challenges  to  national  security.  It  is  in 
accordance  with  the  IMPACT  (International  Multilateral  Pact  Against  Cyber  Threats).  The 
motivation  is  to  create  a  vision  for  keeping  the  country  secure  in  government  sectors,  private 
sectors,  citizens  and  international  cyberspace.  However,  after  a  heist  of  such  a  large  scale 
Bangladesh can easily assume the security condition of her cyberspace. It’s high time to take a 
look at the cyber security strategy of Bangladesh that is currently in place. The approach that has 
been taken to achieve the goal is pretty straight forward. Different countries have taken different 
measures to make their NCSS better. As the motive is to know the present situation of the NCSS 
of  Bangladesh,  it  seems  a  good  plan  to  compare  it  with  some  already  strategically  strong 
countries and some less strong ones to find Bangladesh's position in that chart.  

3. LITERATURE REVIEW 

Various  research  contributions  towards  cyber  security  had  been  made  formerly.  However  the 
comparative research that this paper is focused on is believed to be able to fulfil a research gap. 
To  state  the  motives  behind  developing  cyber  security  strategy  three  individuals  Azmi,  Tibben 
and Win orchestrated a literature review of National Cyber Security Strategy on global context. 
The  review  [7]  used  qualitative  comparison  approach  between  54  countries  and  the  findings 
shows key reasons behind creating cyber security strategy. It implies the importance for creating 
cyber security strategy. The main drawback was, the conclusions they reached were based on the 
study  of  existing  NCSS  themes.  Therefore  the  reliability  of  the  themes  could  not  be  ensured. 
Another Case study performed by the National Cyber Bureau of Israel on Cyber security policy 
model  proposed  a  framework  for  the  creation  of  cyber  security.  The  case  study  [8]  was  a 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
International Journal on Cybernetics & Informatics (IJCI) Vol. 8, No.2, April 2019 
comparative  research  between  the  NCSS  of  countries  that  are  considered  world  pioneers  in 
technology. The study was conducted by Deniel Benoliel. The study found some best practices 
that were followed by all the countries involved in the cross comparison of the study. However 
the  limitation  of  the  study  is  every  country  has  some  different  agenda,  therefore  they  certainly 
will have some differences while creating their strategies due to distinct national and international 
interests. The framework is flexible which can be considered as a positive aspect.  Similar works 
in  the  field  of  cyber  security  strategies  have  been  orchestrated  by  different  authors.  However, 
very  insignificant  attempts  had  been  made  formerly  to  evaluate  the  NCSS  of  Bangladesh  in 
context with the other countries. Therefore this research is going to cover the research gap found 
in  this  context.  As  far  as  the  national  cyber  security  strategy  of  Bangladesh  is  concerned  the 
strategy  outlines  a  framework  for  organizing  and  prioritizing  efforts  to  manage  risks  of 
Bangladesh’s  cyberspace  which  directly  follows  the  GCA  (International  Telecommunication 
Union’s  Global  Cyber  Security  Agenda).  In  line  with  the  GCA,  this  strategy  implies  the 
prioritization of the strategic areas. These areas are – National Cybercrime legislation, reducing 
vulnerabilities in software products, raising awareness and International cooperation. 

3.1 Priority 1: Legal Measures 

The  first  priority  is  focused  on  the  strategies  that  are  involved  with  the  development  of 
cybercrime legislation that is globally applicable. The priority deals with the enactment of laws to 
prosecute and deter cybercrime, establishment and modernization of laws which will depend on 
local needs and national condition. 

3.1.1 Cybercrime Legislation 

In  this  action  the  strategy  implies  that  cybercrime  legislation  should  comply  with  the  global 
conventions  in  order  to  be  interoperable  and  applicable  globally.  And  the  strategy  explicitly 
mentioned  ITU  as  the  matrix  for  the  alignment  of  the  policy  with  global  conventions.  After 
building up the law, the law should be evaluated by all ministries and legislative committees so 
that there’s no usable information missed. In accordance with the strategy, the Cyber Security Act 
2015 has been proposed to fortify the cybercrime legislation [9].  

3.1.2 Government Legal Authority 

Creation  of  law  is  the  first  step  towards  strengthening  our  cyber  security.  Next  is  the 
implementation  of  that  law.  To  make  it  happen,  government  needs  proper  legal  authority.  This 
involves creating cyber security organizations (e.g. - National Cyber Security Council). 

3.2 Technical and Procedural Measures 

This  priority  involves  the  rules  and  regulations  for  creating  organizational  structures.  Any 
organization or company should follow specific regulations set by government. Bangladesh has 
set  the  regulation  on  both  the  CIRT  [10]  and  this  strategy  suggested  the  below  actions  as  the 
technical and procedural measures. 

3.2.1 National Cyber Security Framework 

This action is aimed towards the creation of mandatory security standards and guidance on issues 
such  as  compliance,  assurance  and  risk  management.  This  is  the  framework  that  every  tech 
related company  must adopt. In the first International Cyber Security conference in Bangladesh 
that took place on March 2017, government has taken some declaration that involves guideline or 
instruction for organizations and stakeholders [11].

3.2.1.1 Secure Government Infrastructure 

This  section  deals  with  creating  awareness  of  risks  and  preventive  measures.  This  is  targeted 
towards government departments and agencies. Building a strong security infrastructure involves 
awareness  of  mass  people.    Government  has  established  National  data  centre  and  taken  some 
initiatives in hand to create some high-tech parks. Clearly the numbers of critical infrastructures 
are increasing. Therefore the need of the protecting of those too is increasing. 

3.3 Organizational Structures 

This section  involves the strategy  for  building  the  organizational structures  to  help  prevent and 
respond to attack against critical infrastructure.  

3.3.1 Government’s Cyber Security Role 

The  strategy  suggests  that  the  government  should  take  the  lead  in  securing  the  cyberspace. 
Securing a country’s cyberspace involves not only the government but also the collaboration of 
private sectors. The strategy mentions about appointing an aid as coordinator, who can act as the 
head of the National cyber security. 

3.3.2 National Cyber Security Council  

To coordinate this national effort the government of Bangladesh has taken steps to create a multi-
council body, which is known as National Cyber Security Council. This council involves different 
roles  such  as  developing  national  plans  [12],  incident  response  capacity,  strategic  advice  [13] 
acting  as  national  authority  for  information  assurance,  collaborating  with  international  schemes 
[14] and perform R&D.  

3.3.3 National Incident Management Capacity 

This section of the strategy deals about the incident management capacity. Prevention is always 
better  than  cure.  However,  there’s  no  way  anyone  can  be  sure  that  any  large  scale  prevention 
method  can  defend  or  prevent  attacks.  This  strategy  portion  has  discussed  about  the  damage 
control  policy  after  any  possible  incident  takes  place.  For  any  kind  of  cyber  related  incident 
response,  Bangladesh  government  has  established  an  Incident  response  team  named  BD-CIRT 
[15]. 

3.3.4 Public Private Partnership 

It’s an important fact that, not only government can handle the threats that they are against. As 
cyber  space  is  an  open  platform,  it’s  more  dependent  on  the  private  sectors.  Therefore  private 
sectors have a great deal of influence on Bangladesh’s cyber space. This section of the strategy 
dictates  the  terms  on  private-  public  relationship.  Bangladesh  government  has  issued  policy  on 
different  aspects  of  cyber  space  both  on  business  level  and  security  level  for  private 
organizations.  It  is  mandated  that  the  private  sectors  must  obey  the  policy  been  imposed.  This 
policy involves the collaboration of work and resources, exchange of information and regulation 
for stakeholders between government and private sectors [16]. 

3.3.5 Cyber Security Skills and Trainings 

This section covers the security related trainings and skills framework. Bangladesh government  
has taken multiple steps to increase the number of IT professionals within 2021. They have taken  
4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
International Journal on Cybernetics & Informatics (IJCI) Vol. 8, No.2, April 2019 
projects on training and creating skilled IT professionals. Though here the need for Cyber security 
skills  and  trainings  are  mentioned,  no  particular  project  to  create  skilful  cyber  warriors  has  yet 
been started. 

3.3.6 National Culture of Cyber Security 

Cyber security awareness can reduce the impact of cyber-attacks at great extent. The way internet 
is  growing,  awareness  about  its  crimes  has  not  grown  in  the  same  manner.  This  section  of  the 
policy  discusses  about  necessary  steps  to  take  to  create  awareness  among  mass  people  and 
government employees.  

4. METHODOLOGY 

4.1 Research Type 

This research requires gathering relevant information from the specified documents related to the 
intended topic. Therefore, qualitative research will be followed in this study in order to analyse 
and come to an understanding about the cyber security strategy of Bangladesh. 

4.2 Method to Carry Out Research 

The  research  method  that  will  be  used  is  analysing  other  country’s  cyber  security  strategy  in  a 
cross comparison with the cyber security strategy of Bangladesh that will help to understand the 
strength of the cyber security policy of Bangladesh. A brief review of the strategy of Bangladesh 
will  be  done  prior  to  the  cross  comparison  between  other  countries.  Five  other  countries  have 
been  chosen  as  the  comparison  vector.  Cyber  security  strategies  of  USA,  Japan,  Malaysia, 
Singapore and India will be studied and analysed. Those analysed data will be categorized into 
some criteria that are already been suggested as standards for a cyber-security strategy framework 
by  the  Israeli  National  Bureau  of  Cyber  security.  Those  categorized  information  will  then  be 
compared side by side with the cyber security strategy of Bangladesh.  

4.3 The Comparison Criteria 

Strategic differences cannot be avoided. However, it has been found that whichever level of threat 
a country is facing, if it has to survive the cyber space in a secure manner, these few categories 
are  known  to  be  best  practised  and  to  be included  in  the  cyber  security  strategy  of  a  particular 
country as these have been already been a part of the cyber security strategy of some of the highly 
technologically  advanced  countries 
the  United  Stated,  United  Kingdom,  Canada, 
Netherlands, Japan etc. The practices and declared policies by above mentioned countries suggest 
the following list of criteria as best practices [17]. 

like 

4.3.1 Promote Cyber security R&D 

Such practices will cultivate dynamic research communities that are able to take next generation 
challenges and it will bring an opportunity for the industries to expand the overseas markets.    

4.3.2 Promote Cyber security Education 

Such practice helps nations gain the required resources and skills to build a resilient infrastructure 
and technology to achieve desired level of security in cyberspace.

 4.3.3 Ensuring on  going Risk Assessment 

For  justifying,  certifying  and  to  strengthen  the  cyber  security  strategy  and  competence  of 
information security and the policy, this practice should be exercised periodically. 

4.3.4 Promote Counter Cybercrime Policy 

As  the  international  nature  of  cybercrime  goes,  to  increase  the  capabilities  of  the  law 
enforcements and the legislation both in national and international level, this practice helps. 

4.3.5 Promote Cyber security in International Law 

Because of the international nature of cybercrime, it’s diversity in language, culture and ideas are 
noticeable. For the same reason international cyber laws are to be applied. To collaborate to the 
international laws, this practice is necessary. 

4.3.6 Forms of Regulation and Institutional Aspects 

There must be some technological standards and regulations to be followed to ensure a safe cyber 
space. This practice is about the regulations to be maintained by institutions both in public and 
private sectors. 

4.3.7 Balancing Cyber security with Civil Liberties 

Sometimes  too  much  security  and  regulation  scare  away  the  potential  users.  Therefore  this 
practice is about a less complex cyberspace with proper security. 

4.3.8 Types of Cooperation 

Without  cooperation  there  will  be  no  safe  cyberspace.  There  are  four  different  types  of 
cooperation,  namely,  Public  Private  Platform,  Inter-Governmental  Cooperation,  Regional 
Cooperation, and Intra-Governmental Cooperation.

awareness  to  anticipate,  detect,  and  respond  to  insider  threats  before  they  have  an 
impact. 
(1)To establish a mechanism to implement a risk-based approach.  
(2)It needs to continue the measures being carried out by each individual actor, while 
implementing  handling  with  appropriate  and  timely  allocation  of  resources  for 
responding to ever-changing risks.   
(1)  Through  identification  and  prioritization  of  cyber  risks  and  CIIs  through  risk 
assessments, vulnerability assessments and system reviews. 
(2)  Implement  across  all  critical  sectors,  a  CII  Protection  Program  with  robust  and 
systematic  cyber  risk  management  processes.  A  key  part  of  the  CII  Protection 
Program  is  to  grow  a  culture  of  cyber  risk  awareness  across  all  levels  of  a  CII 
organization. 
(3)  Continuous  measurement  of  performance  through  process  audits  and  cyber 
security exercises [35].  
(1)To  qualify  implementation  of  global  security  best  practices  in  formal  risk 
assessment  and  risk  management  processes,  business  continuity  management  and 
cyber  crisis  management  which  is  planned  to  reduce  the  risk  of  disruption  and 
improve the security posture. 
(2)To  create  awareness  of  the  threats,  vulnerabilities  and  consequences  of  bitch  of

4. Promote Counter Cybercrime Policy 
(1) The Defence Department will draw on best-practices to counter the proliferation 
of destructive malware within the international system to work with the Department 
of State and other agencies of the U.S. government as well as U.S. allies and partners 
[38]. 
(2)DoD  will  work  in  collaboration  with  the  intelligence  community  to  develop  the 
data  schema,  databases,  algorithms,  and  modelling  and  simulation  (M&S) 
capabilities necessary to assess the effectiveness of cyber operations 
(3) To expand companies' participation in threat information sharing programs, such 
as the Cyber Security/Information Assurance program.  
(4)Protect  intellectual  property  including  commercial  trade  secrets  from  theft  and 
industrial espionage. 
(1)The Japanese National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) will take 
measures  for  sharing  information  through  cooperation  with  the  private  sector 
including  the  “Council  to  prevent  Unauthorized  Communications”  as  a  cyber-
intelligence measure.  
(2)Japan has ratified the convention on Cybercrime and will work to strengthen rapid 
and effective mutual investigations and other cooperation between law enforcement 
agencies [40].  
(1)Prevention  is  therefore  still  the  key  strategy  to  counter  the  threat  of  cybercrime. 
The  NCAP  will  prioritize  educating  and  empowering  the  public  to  be  safe  in 
cyberspace.  
(2)To  put  together  businesses  and  the  community  to  make  cyberspace  safer,  by 
countering cyber threats, combating cybercrime and protecting personal data. 
Having  reactive  and  piecemeal,  India’s  response  to  cyber  threats  so  far.  India  has 
relied  either  on  the  information  of  a  new  agency  or  a  coordinator  committee  after 
every  major  cyber-attack  or  intelligence  failure.  Complementing  these  actions, 
India’s  department  of  Electronics  and  Information  Technology  (DEITY),  under  the 
aegis of Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT), released 
the country’s maiden National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP) on 02 Jul 2013 [39].  
-- 
(1)To mobilize business and the community to make cyber space safer by countering 
cyber threats, combating cybercrime and protecting personal data [37].  
(2) To create a national CIRT, defines the legal basis, for example, the  Act defines 
the powers to shut down a critical infrastructure if at risk of a cyber-attack. 
(3)  Enhance  law  enforcement  capabilities  in  the  investigation,  prevention  and 
prosecution of cybercrimes.

international laws, threats and conventions.  
(2) To make recommendations of the type of amendments required. This would also 
include  addressing  methods  and  processes  of  reconciling  and  harmonizing  the 
legislation where general comments will be made of the current legislation.  
(1)The alignment of cybercrime legislation with the ITU Toolkit for cybercrime helps 
international cooperation and addresses jurisdictional and evidentiary issues. 
 (2)The  cybercrime  law  should  similarly  be  evaluated  by  the  local  private  sector  by 
any  local  affiliate  of  the  international  private  sector  by  local  non-governmental 
organizations,  by  academics,  by  unaffiliated  interested  citizens,  by  willing  foreign 
governments and anyone else with a recognized interest. 
(3)It is recommended that the text of National Cybercrime law be drafted to comply 
with the provisions of the convention on cybercrime (2001).

6. RESULT DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

By  analysing  the  comparison  data  from  the  above  tables,  Improvements  are  suggested  in  the 
following categories.  

6.1 Research and Development 

In case of research and development, Bangladesh has taken a more generalized approach than a 
specified  one.  Research  and  development  on  cyber  security  is  listed  but  in  which  approach  or 
what kind of initiative would be taken, have not been mentioned. That clearly explains that much 
thought was not given on these particular criteria when this strategy was proposed. To do further 
improvement in the R&D, following initiatives can be considered –R&D practice in both public 
and  private  sectors  (Indian  strategy),  practical  testing  of  technology  (Japan  Strategy)  research 
both  in  technology  and  human  science  (Singapore  Strategy),  establishing  security  R&D 
consortium (Singapore Strategy). 

6.2 Promote Cyber Security Education 

Bangladesh has included cyber security education plan in their strategy. As it’s a vision for 2021, 
hopefully they can be seen in implementation in upcoming years. The plan on promoting cyber 
security  education  involves  training  of  security  professionals,  spreading  awareness  through 
education  curriculum,  certifications  and  training  of  policy  makers,  government  officials  and

International Journal on Cybernetics & Informatics (IJCI) Vol. 8, No.2, April 2019 
anyone  related  to  the  cyber  security  force. To  further  improve  the security  following  initiatives 
can  be  considered  –spreading  awareness  from  elementary  schools  through  including  cyber 
security in their education (Japan), training programs both in formal and informal sectors in cyber 
security  (India),  voluntary  activities of  private enterprises  and  educational  institutions to spread 
awareness (Japan), scholarship programs and industry oriented curriculum to encourage talents to 
step into cyber security (Singapore). Though the strategy of UK was not compared however, to 
improve  educational  involvement  to  create  higher  and  degree-level  apprenticeships  to  address 
skills gaps in essential areas, supporting the accreditation of teacher professional development in 
cyber security to support others learning and to understand cyber security education and provide a 
method of externally accrediting such individuals and to develop a Defensive Cyber Academy for 
cyber training can be suggested (UK 2016). 

6.2.1 Ensure Ongoing Risk Assessment 

The cyber security policy of Bangladesh shows quite promising aspects about risk assessment. In 
fact the policy is quite strong in comparison with other countries that are being compared with. 
To further improve the strategy the followings can be considered -identification and prioritization 
of risks and reviewing them, and continuous measurement of performance through process audits 
and  cyber  security  exercises  (Singapore),  establish  formal  and  encourage  informal  information 
sharing exchanges (Malaysia), engage international participation in cyber security exercises and 
protect intellectual  property  (US  2014).  Use  of existing  powers  for  online  offences and    spread 
the use of Cyber-Specials to help the police (UK 2010) can also be suggested. 

6.3 Promote Counter Cybercrime Policy 

To strengthen the cyber security, Bangladesh has prepared their plan for fighting against attacks 
in  the  policy.  Establishing  National  CIRT,  creating  cyber  forensic  division,  mobilizing  threats, 
enhancing  law  enforcement  capabilities  are  some  notable  positive  traits  of  the  cyber  security 
strategy of Bangladesh. To further improve its strength following can be considered -Rapid and 
effective  mutual  investigation  and  other  cooperation  between  security  enforcement  agencies 
(Japan),  install  products  on  government  networks  that  will  provide  assurance  that  software  is 
running  correctly  and  not  being  maliciously  interfered  with,  promote  an  Internet  Protocol  (IP) 
reputation service to protect government digital services (this would allow online services to get 
information about an IP address connecting to them, helping the service make more informed risk 
management decisions in real time) and foster hardware and software providers to sell products 
with security settings activated as default, requiring the user to actively disable these settings to 
make them insecure (UK 2016). 

6.4 Promote Cyber Security in International Law 

This is another generalized section of the cyber policy of Bangladesh. To participate in the major 
discussions  in  international  aspect,  some  empowered  party  will  be  responsible  for  keeping  the 
balance  between  international  and  national interests. To  promote  cyber  security  in  international 
law, as Bangladesh is a member country of IMPACT, there are possibilities to make additional 
improvements in this matter. The following steps adopted by strategically strong countries can be 
considered such as establish framework of cooperation and exchange information with regional or 
international forums such as ASEAN (Japan) and promote openness to innovation (UK 2010). 

6.5 Forms of Regulation 

The strategy suggests cybercrime legislation to be aligned with the ITU toolkit along with the  
public-private evaluation. To further improve the strength, educating and facilitating awareness of

the regulatory framework (India) can be suggested. 

6.6 Balancing Cyber Security with Civil Libraries 

Cyber  security  and  civil  liberty  should  be  in  parallel  in  order  to  keep  a  non-suffocating  cyber 
space.  The  cyber  policy  of  Bangladesh  is  not  very  bright  in  this  matter.  To  further  improve, 
ensure freedom of expression and protection of privacy (Japan), support civil society to achieve 
reliable, secure and safe platforms (US 2014) can be suggested. 

6.7 Types of Cooperation 

Bangladesh is only behind in regional cooperation. To improve it further following can be  
considered,  actively  participating  in  multi  country  discussions  and  meetings  of  regional  forums 
and making pact with them such as the ASEAN (Japan, Singapore), engaging key private sector 
stakeholders,  to  enhance  cybercrime  prevention  efforts,  raise  awareness  of  cybercrimes  and 
encourage  the  adoption  of  good  cyber  hygiene  practice  (Singapore),  fosters  international  and 
regional organizations to support capacity building (UK-2010) can be suggested. Strengthen and 
embed  a  common  understanding  of  responsible  state  behaviour,  building  on  agreement  that 
continue to promote the agreement and ensure fewer places exist where cyber criminals can act 
(UK 2016) can also be suggested.  

7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

By  observing  the  cyber  security  strategy  along  with  the  other  security  strategies  of  different 
countries,  it  is  clear  that  some  of  the  criteria  of  the  strategy  of  Bangladesh  are  in  very  good 
condition and some are yet to be given some more thoughts as there is scope for improvements. 
The strategy is somewhat strong in promoting cyber security education, ongoing risk assessments, 
counter cybercrime policy, forms and regulation and types of cooperation though most of these 
have the space for some minor improvements. However, some major improvements are required 
in  the  Research  and  Development,  Coordination  with  the  International  law,  Balancing  Cyber 
Security with Civil Liberties and regional cooperation. 

Though the study found that the cyber security strategy of Bangladesh is in a promising state, by 
improving the mentioned sectors and implementing the existing ones, only then this can be called 
as  a  resilient  strategy  that  is  prepared  to  handle  most  situations.  However,  strategy  is  merely  a 
document if not utilized and implemented properly. Only the proper implementation of these can 
keep the country safe from a hostile cyberspace and turn that into a safer one. Although this study 
seeks to assess the NCSS of Bangladesh and provide suggestions to improve it, the findings and 
suggestions  should  be  considered  tentative.  These  suggestions  were  collected  from  the  existing 
strategies of different countries. It was not justified if they are really compatible with the national 
interest of Bangladesh. Therefore the reliability and compatibility of these suggestions becomes 
the subject of some future research.
