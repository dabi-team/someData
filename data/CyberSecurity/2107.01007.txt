Abstract. The present paper shows a proposal of the characteristics Cloud Risk 
Assessment  Models  should  have  and  presents  the  review  of  the  literature 
considering  those  characteristics  in  order  to  identify  current  gaps.  This  work 
shows a ranking of Cloud RA models and their degree of compliance with the 
theoretical  reference  Cloud  Risk  Assessment  model.  The  review  of  literature 
shows  that  RA  approaches  leveraging  CSA  (Cloud  Security  Alliance)  STAR 
Registry  that  have  into  account  organization´s  security  requirements  present 
higher degree of compliance, but they still lack risk economic quantification. The 
myriad of conceptual models, methodologies and frameworks although based on 
current NIST SP 800:30, ISO 27001, ISO 27005, ISO 30001, ENISA standards 
could be enhanced by the use of techno-economic models like UTEM, created 
by  the  author,  in  order  to  conceive  more  simplified  models  for  effective  Risk 
Assessment and Mitigation closer to the theoretical reference model for Cloud 
Risk Assessment, available for all cloud models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and easy to 
use for all stakeholders.

Introduction 

Cloud Computing is nowadays a non-stoppable trend in marketplace that is impacting 
the  shape  and  operation of  all  industries.  The  advent  of  SARS-Cov-2  pandemic has 
provoked an acceleration of cloud solutions adoption rhythm at a faster pace than all 
stakeholders foresaw.  

Organizations movements towards cloud solutions in current context are not motivated 
only  by  original  convictions  but  in  some  cases  by  urgent  needs  of  coping  with 
challenging changes in demand to scale out IT infrastructure fast and also scale it in 
when necessary, choosing subscription models based in OpEx (Operation Expenses) 
instead  of  CapEx  (Capital  Expenses)  in  order  to  grant  Cash  Flow  and  to  be  able  to 
innovate  fast  and  accelerate  innovation  cycles  (“failing  fast  and  cheap”).  Most 
organizations with IT departments know and use virtualization in private clouds, but 
although many of them know containers technology, there is still a lack of expertise in

using and operating containerized workloads as well as the different available choices 
in public cloud offerings such as Function Platform as a Service (FPaaS) or Code as a 
Service (CaaS) as well as the possibility of using Infrastructure as Code approaches. 

Cloud  adoption  requires  organizations  to  understand  not  only  pure  operational 
challenges  but  also  to  be  aware  of  cyber  security  risks  they  face  before  and  after 
migration and during cloud operation [22]. 

Assessment  of  Cloud  adoption  and  migration  for  different  workloads  from  a  pure 
operational perspective is currently included in cloud ecosystem portfolio. This Cloud 
assessment  can  consider  automatic  IT  infrastructure discovery  and  techno-economic 
evaluation of different cloud service providers identifying workloads, suitability, cost 
and  effort  of  migration  and  operation,  delivering  a  roadmap  of  different  workloads 
migration.  The  assessment  allows  creating  architectural  foundations  considering 
security  and  network  perspectives,  documenting  them  using  Infrastructure  as  Code 
(e.g.:  in  JSON  or  YAML  files)  and  leaving  everything  ready  for  deployment  and 
workload migration. 

However,  as  threat  surface  area  is  increased,  organizations  must  conduct  a 
complementary assessment of cyber security risks for all workloads before and after 
cloud migration with systematic reviews during operation in order to evaluate risks and 
adopt corresponding mitigation strategies [21].  

As defined in [14, 26]: “Cloud risk assessment is defined as a dynamic, step by step, 
repeatable process used to produce an understanding of cloud risks associated with 
relinquishing control of data or management of services to an external party (service 
provider)”. 

There  are  diverse  cyber  security  risk  assessment  models  and  methodologies  in  the 
literature  with  different  features  and  contributions  to  the  state  of  the  art  which 
compound a very heterogeneous landscape that makes it difficult to standardize and 
industrialize the risk assessment process for cloud based solutions [14, 21]. There has 
also  been  a  lack  of  systematic  research  on  cloud  security  risk  analysis  and  risk 
calculation as well as a trend towards more qualitative analysis or semi-quantitative, 
rather than quantitative research [23]. 

Therefore, there is a need for solvent cyber security risk assessment models that allow 
agile cyber risks assessments in cloud environments. These models should have into 
account  the  different  market  stakeholders’  perspectives:  infrastructure  providers, 
service  providers,  enterprise  end-customers,  SME  end-customers,  government  end-
customers,  considering  all  the  supply  chain  actors  [14].  They  should  be  simple  to 
implement and automatable for agile risk assessment. These models should also provide 
partial and overall risk evaluations in a quantitative way in order to prioritize risks and 
adopt adequate mitigation strategies. 

This paper presents in Section 2 the review of relevant literature models along with 
conclusions of the review in section 2.2 and the statement of the research problem in 
section  2.3.  Section  3  proposes  the  characteristics  an  agile  cyber  security  risk 
assessment model should have. Section 4 shows a classification of the literature models 
according to the degree of compliance with the characteristics of the theoretical model, 
identifying  current  gaps.  Section  5  discusses  related  work  and  Section  6  exposes 
conclusions and future work about using a universal techno-economic model created 
and  developed  by  the  author  [24,  25]  as  a  construct  for  a  new  simple,  agile  and 
Automatic Cloud Cyber Security Risk Assessment Model (ACCSRAM).

Review of the literature of Cloud Risk Assessment Models 

Section 2.1 presents the review of relevant models of Cloud Risk Assessment in the 
literature. The search in the literature has been made using the keywords “Cloud Risk 
Assessment”  from  2014  to  2020  in  IEEE  Xplore,  Google  Scholar,  ScienceDirect, 
SpringerLink,  Elsevier  and  ACM  Direct  Library  databases  selecting  relevant  papers 
that include Cloud RA models. There are references older than 2014 ([8][20]) that have 
been  found  from  initial  papers  references.  Section  2.2  shows  the  conclusions  of  the 
literature review and Section 2.3 states the research problem. 

2.1  Models of the literature 

Reference  [1]  is  SPIRALSRA  Security  Risk  Assessment  Framework  based  on 
Microsoft´s STRIDE  threat model [2, 12] with six categories of threats: Spoofing(S), 
Tampering(T), Repudiation(R), Information Disclosure(I), Denial of Service(D), and 
Elevation of Privileges(E). It also considers Security Goals or Security Requirements 
of customer´s organization or the corresponding stakeholder whose perspective is being 
considered  in  the  risk  assessment.  SPIRALSRA  framework  includes  3  phases:  (1) 
Elicitation, (2) Analysis and (3) Control as exposed in Fig.1. 

Fig. 1. Phases and Activities in the SPIRALSRA Security Risk Assessment Framework 
[1]. 

In [3], authors present a Risk Assessment Framework which provides Quantitative Risk 
Assessment  (QRA)  with  a  numerical  estimate  of  the  probability  of  a  defined  harm 
resulting  from  the  occurrence  of  a  particular  event.  This  framework  integrated  in  a 
software tool called OPTIMIS does not provide economic quantification of risks [4], 
[5]. It has into account Business Level Objectives (BLO), such as Quality of Service 
(QoS)  or  Service  Level  Agreement  (SLA).  It  considers  different  end-users  (service 
providers,  brokers  acting  on  their  behalf,  infrastructure  providers  and  service 
consumers. OPTIMIS has into account the interaction between Service Provider and 
Infrastructure  Provider  including  both  perspectives,  which  allows  to  assess  supply 
chain  risks  as  well  as  different  Cloud  models  (SaaS,  PaaS,  IaaS),  multicloud,  cloud 

 
federation, hybrid cloud, multicloud, private cloud, broker, cloud bursting. It provides 
quantitative risk assessment but no economic output. 

Reference [6] is based on a risk matrix shown in Fig. 2. It quantifies partial and overall 
risk  by  assigning  quantitative  levels  to  assets  considering  incidence,  threats  as 
generation frequency and vulnerabilities in accordance to risk matrix before and after 
countermeasures, considering the following formula: 

 Risk (score) = Assets x Threats x Vulnerabilities 

    (1) 

Fig. 2. Risk Matrix and value assignment to assets, threats and vulnerabilities [6]. 

In [7], authors propose Cloud Service Provider Risk Assessment Manager (CSPRAM) 
framework  oriented  for  Cloud  Service  Providers  (CSP)  enabling  Cloud  Customers 
(CC) to contribute to the risk assessment process by defining risk factors in order to 
produce  more  realistic  risk  output.  Fig.  3  depicts  CSPRAM  framework,  which 
considers  clients´security  requirements  for  risk  acceptance  criteria  and  uses  the 
following equation for risk score mapped on a risk matrix: 

Risk (score) = Impact x Likelihood   

    (2) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3. CSPRAM Security Risk Assessment Framework [7]. 

Reference [8] presents a Quantitative Impact and Risk assessment framework for Cloud 
computing platforms called QUIRC. It uses the definition of risk as the product of the 
probability of a security threat event and its impact as in the following equation: 

Risk (score) = Probability x Impact  

    (3) 

QUIRC bases probability assessment on security reports and uses wide-band Delphi 
method  [9-11]  of  expert  surveys  to  determine  impact  and  weights  for  net  risk 
calculation (overall risk) as a weighted average of risks. It also uses security objectives 
as  those  in  Microsoft´s  STRIDE  threat  model  [2][12],  the  so-called  CIAMAU 
framework  [8]  with  six  security  objectives  (First  three  from  FISMA  [13]: 
Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and last three proposed in [8]: Multi-party trust 
considerations,  Mutual  Auditability  and  Usability)  or  other  security  objectives  (SO) 
models. An example of correspondence is shown in Table 1. The wide-band Delphi 
method  allows  the  determination  of  weights  for  each  of  the  six  security  objective 
categories.  

 
 
 
 
 
Table 1. Correspondence between STRIDE and an example of other SO model [8]. 

Reference [14] proposes the Cyber Supply Chain Cloud Risk Assessment (CSCCRA) 
model  for  CSPs  identification,  analysis  and  evaluation  of  cloud  risks  based  on  the 
dynamic supply chain. CSCCRA conducts an assessment of the cybersecurity posture 
of cloud suppliers prior to risk analysis phase. It uses a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making 
method (MCDM) to rank suppliers cybersecurity posture based on 52 security criteria 
grouped  into  9  security  target  dimensions.  A  z-score  is  calculated  for  each  target 
dimension  and  finally  summed  up  for  each  supplier.  Fig.  4  shows  an  overview  of 
CSCCRA model. Risk output is a monetary value (cost) calculated with the following 
formula:  

Risk(cost)= Impact(cost) x Probability x Frequency    

   (4) 

Poisson distribution is used to represent the frequency of attack. Impact and Probability 
are  represented  by  PERT  distributions  considering  values  of  impact(cost)  and 
probability  provided  by  experts  with  and  without  mitigation  controls.  Risk  value 
calculation  is  obtained  by  using  Monte  Carlo  Simulation  tool  to  combine 
stakeholders´estimation of risk factors values and weighting. 

Fig. 4. Overview of CSCCRA model [14]. 

CARAM [15] is a qualitative risk assessment model based on previous ENISA [16], 
CAIQ and CNIL high-level frameworks. CARAM is oriented to provide Cloud Service 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Customers (CSC) with a practical tool to select a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) that is 
the most compliant with customer´s risk profile. It allows a high degree of automation 
as  it  gets  feed  from  CSA  (Cloud  Security  Alliance)  [17]  Consensus    Assessment 
Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) submitted by CSPs to CSA Star Registry available for 
CSCs  [18]  and  based  on  CSA  Cloud  Control  Matrix  (CCM)  taxonomy  of  security 
controls [19]. For the risk assessment, CARAM computes security, privacy and service 
risks for every CSC-CSP pair. CSCs need to specify acceptable risk levels for security, 
privacy and service categories, but do not need security expert level to specify those 
requirements. 

Predecessor of CARAM is [20] that proposes a benchmarking framework for Cloud 
Security Level Agreements (Cloud SecLAs) using Quantitative Policy Trees (QPTs). 
It  allows  automation  by  gathering  CSA  Star  Registry  information  from  CSPs  and 
it  vs  Cloud  Service  Customer´s  security  requirements  whose 
benchmarking 
specification  needs  security  expertise  level.  Based  on  this  framework,  [20]  shows  a 
Proof  of  Concept  prototype  of  the  framework  called  “QUANTifiable-Security-as-a-
Service” system (QUANTSaaS). Fig. 5 depicts QUANTSaaS system building blocks. 

Fig. 5. Building blocks of the QUANTSaaS system [20]. 

Next  Section  2.2  presents  conclusions  of  the  literature  review  which  lead  to  the 
formulation of the research question in Section 2.3. 

All  the  reviewed  models  are  classified  in  Section  4  according  to  their  degree  of 
compliance  with  the  characteristics  of  the  theoretical  reference  model  proposed  in 
Section 3. 

2.2  Conclusions of the literature review 

Among the set of reviewed cyber risk assessment models in the literature, there is only 
one model that provides quantitative risk assessment with  a monetary value for risk 
[14]. There are only two models that consider supply chain actors´security posture [3, 
14].  Only  a  few  consider  Cloud  Service  Customer´s  security  requirements  but  need 
security expert level to specify them, so poor automation can be accomplished except 
in [20] which does not need security expert level.  

 
 
 
 
 
In summary, there is a myriad of different cyber security risk assessment models with 
different  features  and  contributions  to  the  state  of  the  art  which  compound  a  very 
heterogeneous landscape that makes it difficult to standardize and industrialize the risk 
asssesment process. 

Hence, there is a need to select the most relevant features or characteristics a cyber risk 
assessment model should have in order to achieve an agile and effective risk assessment 
in cloud. 

2.3  Research problem 

Considering the conclusions of the literature review presented in the previous section, 
the research question is stated as follows: 

“Is  it  possible  to  design  effective,  standard,  agile and automatic  cyber  security  risk 
assessment models for cloud in order to industrialize risk economic evaluation in this 
domain?” 

In order to advance towards possible solutions for this research problem, next section 
presents the features or characteristics a theoretical Cloud Risk Assessment Reference 
Model should have.

Characteristics of the theoretical Cloud Risk Assessment 
Reference Model 

The  characteristics  of  a  theoretical  Cloud  Risk  Assessment  Reference  Model  that 
allows agile risk assessment are proposed in this section as 12 characteristics named 
C1-C12. Acronyms are also included to make easy their identification in Table 2 (ST, 
SC, AC, EC, TH, SR, EA, SI, AU, BL, RM, CM). 

The theoretical Agile Cloud Risk Assessment model should consider: 

•  C1: Different stakeholders`perspective: cloud service provider, infrastructure 
provider,  customer  organization,  end-user,  broker,  government,  regulation 
authority (Acronym ST in Table 2). 

•  C2: Supply chain actors and different components perspective (Acronym SC). 
•  C3: All cloud models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), cloud federation, multicloud, hybrid 

cloud, private cloud, broker, cloud bursting (Acronym AC). 

•  C4: Economic risk quantification (Partial risks and overall) (Acronym EC). 
•  C5: Threat based / Relevant Threats / Threat Prioritisation (Acronym TH). 
•  C6:  Security  Requirements  or  Security  Objectives  (Customer´s)  (Acronym 

SR). 

•  C7: Elicitation / Analysis / Control / Mitigation / Review (Acronym EA). 
•  C8: Simplicity / To be as simple as possible (Acronym SI). 
•  C9: Automatable / Automatic assessment (Acronym AU). 
•  C10: Business Level Objectives (BLO) (Acronym BL). 
•  C11: Risk Matrix (Assets, Vulnerabilities, Threats) (Acronym RM). 
•  C12: Countermeasures for risk mitigation (Acronym CM). 

Section 4 shows the classification of relevant papers in the literature according to their 
degree of compliance with these 12 characteristics proposed for the theoretical model, 
identifying current gaps for future work.

Classification of Cloud Risk Assessment Models 

This  section  shows  the  classification  of  the  literature  models  reviewed  in  previous 
section 2.1 according to their degree of compliance with the characteristics proposed in 
section 3 for the theoretical Cloud Cyber Security Risk Assessment Reference model. 

Table  2  shows  characteristics  C1-C12  (in  columns)  with  their  acronyms  for  the 
Theoretical Model and 8 relevant models of the literature (in rows). Table 2 assigns 1 
value to a cell if the model in the row fulfills the characteristic of that column and no 
value (0 value) if the model is not compliant with that characteristic. Total compliance 
for each model is summed up in last column (Total).

Table 2 shows that CARAM [15], QUANTSaaS [20] and QUIRC [8] models are the 
most compliant models from those analysed in the literature with 7 points out of 12 for 
the theoretical reference model what means a 58,33% of compliance. This leaves a gap 
of 41,66% for future models.  

Both CARAM [15] and QUANTSaaS [20] leverage CSP submitted information to CSA 
STAR  Registry,  which  allows  high  degree  of  automation  but  they  still  lack  risk 
economic  quantification.  QUIRC  [8]  is  a  threat-based  model  that  uses  security 
objectives  and  Multi-Criteria  Decision-Making  method  (MCDM)  for  risk  economic 
quantification providing monetary value for risk, but more difficult to automate. 

Thus,  the  characteristics  to  improve  and  bridge  the  mentioned  compliance  gap  of 
41,66% for future models considering these TOP 3 models are C2 (SC: Supply Chain 
Actors and different components perspective), C4 (EC: Economic risk quantification 
(partial and overall) including monetary measures, C5 (TH: Threat based / Relevant 
Threats / Threat Prioritisation), C7 (EA: Elicitation / Analysis / Control / Mitigation / 
Review) having into account the whole cycle periodical review, C8 (SI: Simplicity) and 
C9 (AU: Automatable / Automatic Assessment) in order to make true an agile cyber 
risk assessment in cloud.

Related Work 

the 

A few papers in the literature conduct a classification of cloud risk assessment models 
and methodologies. In [21], authors classify cloud risk assessment methods and tools 
considering  five  categories:  risk  assessment  as  a  service  (RAaaS),  quantitative  or 
qualitative  analysis,  graphs  analysis,  hierarchical  assessment  and  security  matrix 
assessment,  describing 
identifying  contemplated 
stakeholders and concluding that basically studied RA methods use qualitative and/or 
quantitative approach. Reference [22] adds another category: semi-quantitative analysis 
from [27, 28] and compares several methods contemplating stakeholders, automation, 
efficiency,  adaptability,  collaboration  and  support  tool.  In  [14],  authors  present  a 
comparison  of  cloud  RA  models  emphasizing  adopted  assessment  method 
(quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative), use of external experts and supply chain 
associated risks inclusion.  

type  of  risk  modeling, 

This paper proposes the features of a theoretical agile cyber security risk assessment 
reference model based on the literature review and author´s professional experience in 
ICT and cloud computing industry. The subsequent classification of relevant papers of 
the  literature  according  to  the  degree  of  compliance  with  those  features  allows  to 
identify current gaps for further improvement in future models.

Conclusions and Future Work 

This paper has proposed the characteristics a theoretical agile Cloud Cyber Security 
Risk Assessment reference model should have. After reviewing relevant papers of the 
literature,  they  have  been  classified  based  on  their  degree  of  compliance  with  the 
characteristics of the theoretical reference model. The three most compliant models of 
the literature present 58,33% of compliance, leaving a gap of 41.66% for future models 
to accomplish further improvement. From the analysis of the gap in characteristics, this 
improvement should be focused on economic risk quantification, supply chain actors 
and  components  perspective,  threat  prioritisation,  whole  cycle  periodical  review, 
simplicity and automatic assessment in order to achieve agile risk assessment in cloud 
cyber security.   

 
 
 
 
Author´s future work in this direction will consider to use a universal techno-economic 
model called UTEM created and developed by the author [24, 25] as a construct for a 
simple,  agile  and  Automatic  Cloud  Cyber  Security  Risk  Assessment  Model 
(ACCSRAM).  

UTEM model is a universal, flexible, scalable and generalizable model that allows to 
industrialize techno-economic assessment in multiple domains considering all market 
players perspectives, also suitable for technological consulting and currently available 
for all industry stakeholders under specific license of use [24, 25].
