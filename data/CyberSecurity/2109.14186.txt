The  growth  of  the  Internet  and  its  associated  technologies;  including  digital  services  have 
tremendously impacted our society. However, scholars have noted a trend in data flow and 
collection; and have alleged mass surveillance and digital supremacy. To this end therefore, 
nations of the world such as Russia, China, Germany, Canada, France and Brazil among others 
have  taken  steps  toward  changing  the  narrative.  The  question  now  is,  should  Africans  join 
these giants in this school of thought on digital sovereignty or fold their hands to remain on 
the other side of the divide? This question among others are the main reasons that provoked 
the thoughts of putting this paper together. This is with a view to demystifying the strategies 
to  reconfigure  data  infrastructure  in the context  of  Africa.  It  also  highlights  the  benefits  of 
digital technologies and its propensity to foster all round development in the continent as it 
relates to economic face-lift, employment creation, national security, among others. There is 
therefore a need for African nations to design appropriate blueprint to ensure security of her 
digital infrastructure and the flow of data within her cyber space. In addition, a roadmap in 
the  immediate,  short-  and  long-term  in  accordance  with  the  framework  of  African 
developmental goals should be put in place to guide the implementation.

Introduction 

1. 
The  bulk  of  the  economic  power  of  African  nations  have  been  largely  traced  to  their 
dependence on natural resources which include but not limited to oil and gas in Nigeria, Libya 
and Kenya. As well as diamonds in democratic Republic of Congo, Botswana, South-Africa and 
Angola (Baumüller, Donnelly, Alex, & Markus, 2011; Idowu & Lambo, 2018). This include Gold 
in  Ghana,  Tanzania  and  Benin  among  others  (Andrzej  Polus  &  Wojciech  Tycholiz,  2019; 
Siakwah, 2017). The new oil now has been attributed to data as an essential resource that 
powers  the  information  economy  as  a  similitude  of  oil  that  fueled  the  industrial  economy 
(Hirsch,  2015).  Data  has  also  been  opined  as  the  next  phase  of  digital  transformation 
(Capgemini Research Institute, 2020), much more in this era of the fourth industrial revolution 
which requires integration of digitization with physical production tools (Naudé, 2018). The 
process of keeping data with utmost privacy and security is very important (Awoleye, Ojuloge, 
& Ilori, 2014; Thomas & Grimes, 2020). This also include the process of generating and using 
the  same either  as  individuals,  corporate  body or  at  national  level. The advent of  Internet 
technology as well as the emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, 3D printing, 
cloud services, among others; are largely data-driven (Bibri & Krogstie, 2020; Tao et al., 2019). 
With  all  of  the  opportunities  which  digital  technology  has  brought  to  us,  it  has  not  come 
without its associated threats.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Digital Space in Africa and the challenge of Data Privacy and Security  

2.  
The  research  was  born  out  of  the  threats  that  the  existing  management  of  global  digital 
infrastructure  pose  to  our  societies,  most  importantly  in  the  Africa  region.  One  of  which 
among  others  are  the  challenges  of  data  privacy  and  security,  which  could  have  negative 
effect on businesses and national security, if left unattended. Africans have been leveraging 
on critical resources to drive their services; such as the communication satellites providing 
Internet services. This include but not limited to banking services, electronic transactions, e-
government  services,  e-mail  services  etc.  This  does  not  exclude  cloud  services  such  as: 
infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service (Dogo, Salami, & 
Salman, 2013; Ilyas, Ahmad, & Saleem, 2020; Kwet, 2019). The question about what happens 
to our data before they are delivered to the final destination is unclear; since data are routed 
through root servers in the United State (Nocetti, 2015). Other question that may come to 
mind among others is, how much control do Africans have over the technologies adopted? 
All  of  these  bothers  on  the  perceived  technological  and  governance  hegemony  which  has 
been  levied  against  the  United  State  as  it  relates  to  Internet  sovereignty  (Budnitsky  &  Jia, 
2018;  Pohle  &  Thiel,  2020).  In  addition,  another  author  also  reported  an  agenda  termed 
“catch-all term” which was reportedly related to a disclosure of an intelligence of the United 
States to dominate the global digital space, which does not exclude the countries of Africa 
(Couture  &  Toupin,  2019).  All  of  these  are  pointing  to  the  fact  that  our  national  security 
intelligence  and  financial  data  may  be  susceptible  to  manipulation  and  control  by  others, 
which is not desirable (Bozhkov, 2020). This agenda however may have been stealthily carried 
out  following  reports  as  noted  in  extant  literature.  The  situation  in  Nigeria  for  example 
suggest that the digital ecosystem is somewhat porous,  much more as it relates to electronic 
services (Awoleye, Ojuloge, & Ilori, 2014; Bakare, 2015; Salimon, Yusoff, Sanuri, & Mokhtar, 
2015).  For  instance,  majority  of  the  financial  houses  depend  solely  on  foreign  proprietary 
software applications for their daily financial transactions. For example, it was reported that 
an Indian based firm developed Finacle, which is the most prevalent software used among 
the  commercial  banks  in  Nigeria  (Awoleye,  2015).  In the  same  vein, the websites of  those 
banks which are the platforms for their online banking services were noted to be outsourced 
and are mostly developed and managed by foreign developers. This include hosting of the 
same  by  International  firms,  outside  the  shore  of  Nigeria  (Awoleye,  Okogun,  &  Siyanbola, 
2013). The source code however for these software are not available to the banks that have 
acquired  them.  Further  to  this,  China  as  a  country  reportedly  ‘gifted’  the  African  Union  a 
headquarters building which was later discovered to have been bugged to eavesdrop state 
secrets.  China  was  noted  to  have  built  the  Internet  network  architecture  and  allegedly 
inserted a backdoor server that allowed it to transfer data stealthily to Shanghai1 (Meservey, 
2020). This however has been speculated to be the situation for other 186 buildings globally 
(40 of which are in Africa); which China has either built or renovated by her tech giant -Huawei 
(Meservey, 2020). This has succeeded for a number of years before it was discovered, imagine 
what may have been lost. How do we quantify the extent of damage this may have done to 
the continent? In addition, it was reported by Kwet (2019) that the United State in partnership 
with  corporations  in  South  African  tapped  the  Internet  backbone,  collected  trillions  of 
telephone calls, emails as well as banking and social networking data.

Cases of Digital Hegemony in Africa  

3.  
It has been reported in Literature that the nations in the Global South are more vulnerable to 
the digital supremacy agenda, the precursory activities are evident in many countries in Africa 
(Olivier,  2018;  Pinto,  2018).  Some  of  which  are  contrary  to  the  general  data  protection 
regulation  of  the  European  union  and  as  applicable  to  Africa  (Thomas  &  Grimes,  2020; 
Wolford, 2020). For example, in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya; tech giants such as Google, 
Facebook and Instagram dominate the online advertising space, to the detriment of the local 
media  outfits  (Kwet,  2019).  In  addition,  Uber  was  reported  to  have  disrupted  the  road 
transport  businesses,  which  was  reiterated  to  have  affected  a  great  proportion  of  the 
indigenous transport individuals and company’s business to a large extent (Damle, 2018; Jenk, 
2015). The internet thus remains the platform where some of these services thrive, without 
which ecommerce activities (Tamilarasi & Elamathi, 2020), Uber services (Tong, Zhou, Zeng, 
Chen,  &  Shahabi,  2020;  Werbach,  2015),  online  advertisement  (Bruntha,  Yasmeen, 
Indirapriyadharshini, & Giri, 2019; Ching, Tong, Chen, & Chen, 2013; Sanne & Wiese, 2018) 
among  others  could  not  have  succeeded.  The  current  infrastructural  design  has  provided 
imperial control on a number of digital services (Couture & Toupin, 2019; Nocetti, 2015; Pohle 
& Thiel, 2020). In the first instance, the western giants have put access to publications behind 
paywalls. In the same vein, Spotify, Netflix among others are global tech giants, which have 
taken  over  and  colonised  the  entertainment  industry  globally  (Kwet,  2019).  They  have 
provided services such as online streaming of movies and music for meagre fees. This has in 
no  small  way  perturbed  the  traditional  process  of  doing  the  same,  thereby  disrupting  the 
value chain to eliminate the indigenous micro-business that were previously involved in the 
distribution  (Kwet,  2019).  It  is  worth  noting  to  state  that  militating  against  this  control  of 
digital  space  should  not  be  negotiable.  Kwet  (2019)  submitted  that  software  corporations 
such as Microsoft; market proprietary software do not supply the source codes along with the 
applications. By this, the users cannot change the behavior of the software, which thus gives 
the  corporation  absolute  ownership  to  the  so-called  proprietary  licensing.  This  is  however 
viewed as a form of digital colonialism (Kwet, 2019; Pinto, 2018; Pohle & Thiel, 2020). It is 
believed that the ability to control the flow of information and management of the same has 
the propensity to go a long way in bringing political stability which is a precursor to national 
economic development (Bozhkov, 2020). For example, digital technologies was noted to have 
facilitated the political instability that erupted during the Arab spring (Nocetti, 2015).  It is in 
this context that China put forward five main priorities as strategies to take control of their 
cyber space (Bozhkov, 2020; Hong & Goodnight, 2020). In the same vein, Russia as a state 
took pragmatic steps toward retracting their data infrastructure. Of note is their request to 
the United State to relocate all servers to Russia on which Russian citizens' personal data were 
stored. Russia also requested the hosting of their country code top level domain “.ru” to be 
hosted in Russia. (Budnitsky & Jia, 2018; Nocetti, 2015). 

Some Digital Initiatives and Infrastructural Development in Africa 

4. 
Much of what we know about the connectivity of critical digital infrastructure in Africa and its 
impacts  shows  that  African  nations  have  invested  grossly  to  connect  the  continent  to  the 
global Internet backbone (Friederici, Ojanperä, & Graham, 2017; MTN Group sustainability 
report, 2019). MTN as the leading telecommunication service provider in Africa has provided 
22,204 skilled employments and has also invested over R118 billion on capital projects (MTN 
Group sustainability report, 2019). Of note also is GLOBACOM (an indigenous service provider 
in Nigeria) invested a sum of $800 million to build high-capacity fibre-optic cable known as Glo-1. A 

 
submarine cable which connects the United Kingdom to Nigeria. Also in North Africa, the Egyptian 
government  started  a  Smart  Village  Cairo  Initiative  in  2001  that  was  a  public  private 
partnership initiative tech park for software development. As an offshoot of this, the growth 
of the digital ecosystem in Egypt was reportedly attracted USD 59million in 2018 alone among 
other initiatives. Representing the Eastern Africa, Kenya Safaricom in 2007 introduced M-Pesa 
which  is  one  of  the  first  mobile  payment  system  which  originated  in  Africa  and  has  been 
widely  accepted  (Naudé,  2018).  This  revolution  has  enabled  the  creation  of  other  related 
products that ride on the technology in Kenya economy and beyond. Some of which among 
others  are:  the  M-KOPA,  Powerhive  and  ecommerce  innovations  (e.g.  Twiga  foods,  Copia 
global etc). On efforts towards data infrastructure, the Kenyan government was noted to have 
invested  in  four  undersea  fibre-optic  cables  in  2009  to  improve  on  the  quality  of  Internet 
connectivity as well as to reduce the costs of access. These efforts are somewhat spontaneous 
as  most  African  nations  lack  adequate  policy  frameworks  to  drive  digital  projects  in  their 
domains  (Friederici  et  al.,  2017).  The  existing  policies  were  noted  to  be  deficient  and 
somewhat outdated.   

Policy suggestions 

5. 
The following are the highlights of some necessary policy directions that has the propensity 
to put Africa nations in her rightful place as it relates to the control of her data infrastructure.  

  There  is  a  need  to  create  an  encryption/decryption  gateway  (engine)  using 
appropriate  algorithm;  to  transform  documents  going-out  or  coming-in  to  the 
cyberspace of Africa to/from cloud services. 

  Additional  internet  exchange  points  may  be  necessary  to  enable  service  providers 
interconnect to terrestrial fibre backbones in order to facilitate low bandwidth cost. 
Including building globally competitive Data Centres to enable continental hosting of 
websites, files, email among other services.  

  There should be continental Communication satellites, which will have its footprints 
across cooperating Africa countries. In this perspective, the African Union has a great 
role to play as this may require a policy for its governance and sustainability.  

  The linkages of the academia to the Industry has been week in most of the African 
nations.  To  eliminate  the  traditional  challenges  inhibiting  the  required  linkages,  a 
digital platform (model) for patent listings and general research outputs could be 
created.  In  the  same  vein,  as  part  of  the  input  that  should  be  transmitted  to  the 
industries who has the capacity to commercialise innovations are the research outputs 
from  the  knowledge  institutions.  This  model  should  also  digitalize  and  curate  all 
research  outputs 
including  student’s  projects  and  researches.  To  this  end, 
projects/theses  from  1990  to  2020  could  be  considered  to  populate  the  digital 
database.  

  To  provide  access  to  the  knowledge  base,  an  African  version  of  Federal  Identity 
management  system  could  be  adapted  and  developed.  This  will  give  access  to 
relevant  institutions  including  the  industries  who  may  have  registered  with  the 
designated African federation to provide access to the knowledge base.  

  Adequate and appropriate ICT policy frameworks to drive digital projects should be 
developed  and  where  they  exist;  it  should  be  reviewed  to  accommodate  the  new 
thinking.
