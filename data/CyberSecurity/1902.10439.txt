Abstract – With the developing of the attack and defense technology, the cyber environment 
has been more and more sophisticated. We failed to give an accurate evaluation of network 
security  situation,  as  we  lack  a  more  accurate  quantitative  evaluation  of  attack-defense 
behaviors.  In  response  to  this  situation,  we  proposed  an  attack-defense  stochastic  game 
model (ADSGM), analyzed the different security property of distinct defense mechanism, and 
put forward a corresponding utility calculation coping with the distinct defense mechanism. 
Through a case study, we showed the impact of active defense and the risk of attack exposure, 
demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods on attack-defense behavior quantification. 
This paper filled with the gap in the quantitative assessment of defensive measures, to make 
the quantitative evaluation of attack-defense more comprehensive and accurate.

Introduction 

With  the  developing  of  the  attack  and 
defense technology, the cyber environment 
has been so sophisticated that the network 
administrators or experts cannot accurately 
evaluate the security situation of a network 
system  on  intuition.  On  the  other  hand,  a 
wide  variety  of  threats  continually  cause  a 
huge  damage  to  the  governments  and 
enterprises both in economy and reputation. 
A major reason for this dilemma is that the 
defenders lack a more accurate quantitative 
evaluation  of  attack-defense  behaviors.  In 
addition,  the  attack  tricks  are  more  and 
more sophisticated and automatic.   

In  a  cyber  environment,  the  attack-
defense behaviors are a series of actions the 
adversaries  and  the  defenders  take  for 
different intentions. As the adversaries and 
the  defenders 
confront  each  other 
continually,  the  interaction  between  the 
attack behaviors and the defense behaviors 
is  a  game  process.  Different  behavior 

the  defenders  are  able 

choices  mean  the  different  payoffs  which 
include  benefits  and  costs,  and 
this 
produces  the  attack-defense  strategy  that 
profiles  the  preference.  By  studying  the 
interaction  between  attack  and  defense 
behaviors, 
to 
produce  a  reasonable  optimal  defense 
strategy.  What's  more,  when  the  attack-
defense  game  is  in  equilibrium, 
  the 
corresponding  payoff  shows  the maximum 
security risk value of the target network, and 
this  value  equals  to  the  network  security 
situation.  Particularly,  at  the  moment  that 
the  adversary  choose  the  optimal  attack 
strategy  and  the  costs  still  exceed  the 
benefit, the network can be regarded as safe. 
There are a lot of metrics and evaluation 
approaches that try to evaluate the security 
situation of the network both in qualitative 
and quantitative. Attack graph[1] is a typical 
work,  which  applies  topological  graph  to 
analyze  the  security  vulnerabilities  and  the 
interaction  of  nodes.  It  can  be  used  to 
evaluate  the  cybersecurity  of  enterprise

relationship  between  nodes,  ignoring  the 
other threats like spoofing attack and hijack 
attack, furthermore, it neglects the impact of 
defensive measures. A Bayesian network[4]–
[6] is another popular method, which is used 
to  calculate  the  uncertainty  and  inherent 
uncertainty  within  cyber  environment.  For 
example,  [5]  applied  Bayesian  networks  on 
attack  success  rate  whereas  [4]  used  it  to 
describe safety risk factors in target network. 
Game theoretic evaluation approach [7]–
[9] 
is  a  comprehensive  method  which 
considers  both  the  adversary  and  the 
defender  who

strategies  made  by  multiple  decision-
makers, game theory has been widely used 
in network security[10]–[15]. It is suitable to

and  defenders  and  helps  the  defenders

However, despite there are a lot of related 
work  evaluating  network  security  situation 
by  game  theory,  existing  work  in  this  area 
suffers from three key limitations, which lead 
to the inaccuracy of the evaluation. First, the 
calculation 
is 
oversimplified  and  impractical,  therefore  it 
cannot profile the utility of behaviors clearly. 
For  example,  previous  work[16]  only  takes 
account  of  recovery  capability  of  defense, 
the  deceptive  capability  and  the  tracing 
capability do not include, so the impact  of 
defense  measures  is  inaccurate.  Besides, 
proactive  defense  technologies  such  as 
cyber  deception[17]  come  into  vogue  in 
network  protection,  the  previous  works, 
however, only consider the passive defense 
and  the  recovery  capability.  In  fact,  many 
defensive  measures  like  cyber  deception, 
intrusion  detection  provide 
two  extra 
capability,  which  can  greatly  improve  the 
the 
security  of 

the  network.  Thirdly, 

increasing  Advanced  Persistent  Threat 
events give us more thought of the length 
of  attack  time,  the  concealment  and  the 
scalability of attack should be considered in 
the utility of behaviors. 

This paper adopts and extends the game 
theoretic  methods  to  evaluate  the  attack-
defense behaviors on different scenarios, by 
generating  the  optimal  attack  strategies, 
then  calculates  the  maximum  security  risk

network.  The  major  contributions  of  this

following  features  of  the  attack-defense 
process:

this  paper 

1)  Attack-Defense  Process  is  a  phased 
process,  and  in  each  phase,  the  adversary 
and the defender are going to play a game.

the change of network system state. 

3)  The  uncertainty  of  attack-defense 
behaviors:  Both  the  adversaries  and  the 
defenders  would  take  more  than  one 
actions equally in a certain system state, so 
the  adverse  actions  are  invisible  or  part  of 
invisible. 

4) If the adversaries exposure, they would 
be  punished,  so  they  take  account  of 
clearing their traces and retreating from the 
compromised  computers  within  a  certain 
time, even though they did not achieve their 
goal. 

A stochastic game, which belongs to the 
dynamic game, is a suitable model, it starts 
with  an  initial  state,  and  then  it  would  go 
through  a  series  of  state  transformation 
based  on  both  the  actions  taken  by  each 
player and the current state. 

1.  Attack-Defense  Stochastic 

Game Model 

Firstly, in the real cyber environment, there 
are  multiple  attackers  and  multiple 
defenders,  however,  this  paper  try  to  find 
the  maximum  security  risk  value  of  the 
target network, and multiple players have no 
effect  on  this,  so  we  make  a  reasonable 
assumption to simplify the problem: 
Assumption  1 ： We  consider  multiple 
attackers  as  one  attacker,  and  multiple 
defenders as one defender. 
Definition  1 ： Attack-Defense  Stochastic 
Game Model (ADSGM)=｛N,S,A,D,P,U｝is a 
zero-sum Stochastic game: 
1)  Participant set N=｛Attacker, Defender｝
represents the players in the game; 
2)  System  state  space  S=  {S0,  S1,  S2  … 
SK}, ∀k ∈ Z and k ≥ 0   consists  of  all 
possible  state  of  the  target  network 
system.  In  particular,  we  regard  the 

3)  Adversary actions set  A= {a1, a2, a3  … 
an}, where ∅ ∈ A, and at the state k, the 
adversary actions set is Ak; 

4)  Defender  actions  set  D=  {d1,  d2,  d3 … 
dm}, where ∅ ∈ D, and at the state k, the 
defender actions set is Dk; 

5)  Transition 

probability 

set 
P=S×A×D×S->[0,1]; 
where 
𝑘𝑙(𝑎𝑖, 𝑑𝑗) ≥ 0 ∈ P   is  the  probability 
𝑝𝑖𝑗
that  under  the  actions  𝑎𝑖 and  𝑑𝑗 ,  the 
state k transfers to state l. 

6)  Utility set Uk: S×A×D×S->vk, wherek =
𝑎𝑖, 𝑑𝑗  and  vk  is  the  utility  value  of  the 
players  in the game;  In addition,  since 
ADSGM  is  a  zero-sum,  it  means  that 
the sum of the adversary utility and the 
defender utility is zero: Ua + Ub = 0; 
7)  Proof of Nash equilibrium existence: 
regarded  as  an 
ADSGM  can  be 
extension of matrix game for each state, 
the state S, the Adversary actions A and 
Defender actions D and the utility value 
Ua and Ub are finite. As a result, ADSGM 
is  a  finite  stochastic  game  and  since 
Fink[18]  draw  a  conclusion  that  every 
finite  stochastic  game  exits  a  stable 
Nash equilibrium, ADSGM must have a 
stable Nash equilibrium.   

2. Attack-Defense scenarios

many  distinguish  stages.  For  each  of  the 
stages, 
achieved 
corresponding  tasks,  which  most  of  the 
cases  were  the  condition  of  the  next  task. 
The  adversary  adopted  different  attack 
in  different  stages  and  the 
technique 
defenders took the corresponding defensive 
measures,  so  the  confrontation  and  the 
techniques  and 
game  between  attack 
defense  techniques  distributed  in  different 
stages  so  we  classified  them  into  these 

stages  to  produce  the  strategies.  We 
followed  the  categories  of  colasoft[19]  in 
this paper. 

Moreover, as Table 1 shown, we divided 

the defensive measures into two categories: 
proactive  defense  and  passive  defense.  It 
was  mainly  because  that  they  differed  in 
computing methods for the utility.

3. Attack-Defense State Transition 

of a stochastic game   

    This paper converted the stochastic game 
state  transition  (which  means  the  state 
transition of the network system) as the state 
transition of each node in the target network. 
Since  a  state  transition  of  a  node  usually 
means  that  the  other  nodes  are  going  to 
face  new  security  threats  such  as  the 
watering hole, hijack attack and so on, and 
consequently  the  network  system  security 
situation may have changed accordingly. So 
essentially,  the  system  state  transition  was 
owing to the state transitions of each node 
and 
conversion  was 
reasonable. 
    In  ADSGM,  the  attack-defense  state 
transition  can  be  modeled  as  a  directed 
graph  G=(S,  E),  in  which  S  represents  the 
game state set and E describe the transition 
of state.   

this  equivalent 

Fig1. Example of ADSGM’s state 
    According to fig.1, the system state space 
is  S  =  {S1,  S2,  S3}  and  the  𝑝𝑖𝑗(𝑎𝑖, 𝑑𝑗) 
represents the possibility from current state 
to the next state while the adversary and the 
defender  take  the  actions  𝑎𝑖   and  𝑑𝑗 
respectively,  since  not  all  of  the  states  can 
transfer  certainly  to  each  other,  and  some 
transition  between  the  nodes  can  be 
impossible. 
    In  addition,  for  each  node,  the  possible 
attack-defense actions according to table 1 
determined  the  type  of  state  the  node 
include, and we conclude four types of state 
for  node: a)  no privilege; b)  remote access 
privilege; c) root privilege; d) data leak state. 
Moreover, despite a node could have many 

 
 
 
 
types of state, but the adversary tends to let 
the  node  into  a  more  dangerous  state  to 
obtain  maximum  payoff,  so  this  paper 
produced the system state set by a greedy 
generation algorithm, which chose the most 
dangerous  state  of  all  possible  state  by  a 
heuristic  method.  An  equally  important 
reason we found was that as the number of 
states for the node grew, the complexity of 
ADSGM increased exponentially, so we give 
the greedy algorithm:

4. Utilities of actions in ADSGM 

    In ADSGM, the attack-defense actions 
described the attack-defense behaviors, 
and in the rest of this article, we use both 
of them indiscriminately. 
The attack-defense utility profiled the 
expectation of an action the adversary and 
the defender took, and it determined the 
generation of strategies. Regarding the 

evolution of attack-defense behaviors as a 
game of the adversary and the defender, 
and at the principle that both the adversary 
and the defender were rational, then we 
calculated the maximum payoff of all 
strategies to regard as security situation of 
the network. 
-Adversary knowledge and utility 

Following the previous researches[7], [16], 
this  paper  divided  the  utility  of  an  attack 
behavior  into  two  part:  one  part  was  the 
benefit of the attack behavior, it came from 
the  damage the  system suffered,  and  the 
other  one  was  the  costs  of  the  attack 
behavior, so the attack utility formula was 
as follow: 
Definition  2:  The  attacker  utility  functions 
were: 
𝑈𝑎 = 𝐵𝑎 − 𝐶𝑎                                                                               (1) 
Where  Ba  represented  the  benefit  of  the 
attack behavior and Ca was the cost of the 
attack behavior. 
    Furthermore,  this  paper  subdivided  the 
cost part into two type:   
a)  The cost of the resource, for  example, 
the  computing  resource  and  network 
resource; 

b)  The risk of exposure refer to the risk of 

exposing the adversaries themselves. 

We found that the second part of costs is the 
major factor that influences the decision of 
adversaries,  so  simplified  the  problem  that 
the risk of exposure equaled the total cost of 
the  attack  action.  In  the  next  section,  we 
demonstrated how it affected the strategies 
and the result of a game. 
- Defensive measures and utility 
    In 
the 
administrator arranges a variety of defensive 
measurement to hinder the attack behaviors, 
and consequently prevent the achievement 
of  the  adversary  goal,  and  the  degree  of 
system security depends on the intention of 
attack  the  system  can  resist,  so  it  is 

real  network 

system, 

a 

important to measure this ability. 

In the previous section, we discussed the 
attack-defense  scenarios  and  divided  the 
defensive measures into two categories. The 
basis  of  categories  were  not  only  the 
different mechanisms they possessed, more 
importantly,  but  also  we  found  that  they 
provided  different  defensive  abilities. 
Traditional passive defensive measures such 
as firewall, patch management provided the 
“Recovery Capability”, in contrast, proactive 
defensive  measures  like  cyber  deception 
tried  to  conceal  the  target  network,  create 
the 
uncertainty  and  confusion  against 
adversary's  efforts  to  establish  situational 
awareness  and  to  influence  and  misdirect 
decision 
adversary 
processes.  This  paper  characterized  this 
ability as “Deceptive Capability”. 

perceptions 

and 

Finally,  there  was  another  ability  called 
“Tracing  Capability”,  which  often  was 
ignored by evaluation tools. Actually, it was 
an implicit factor influenced the evolution of 
attack-defense behaviors, since it related to 
the  cost  of  attack  actions.  Higher  tracing 
capability brought a higher risk of exposure, 
and we try to use a metric  called “average 
attack time” to weight the balance between 
them. 
-Average attack time and utility 
    In order to evaluate the risk of exposure 
for the adversary and the tracing capability 
tentatively 
of 
introduced  the  concept  of  the  attack  time 
and  average  attack  time  to  calculate  the 
effect of them on utility. Firstly we give the 
definition of the attack time and the average 
attack time: 
Definition 3：Attack time was the length of 
time that the adversary launched a specific 
attack until they finished. 
Definition 4: Average attack time was the 
average duration of a specific attack for 
most adversaries.

    The attack time describe the    For our 
evaluation, the average attack time is an 
empirical constants, 

This  paper  explained  how  these  three 
capabilities worked on the utility calculation 
and  the  evaluation  of  the  network  security 
situation.  To  begin  with,  we  put  forward 
three  attributes  to  signify  the  capability  of 
each  defensive  measures,  and  introduced 
the calculation methods: 
Recovery Capability (R)： 

R  was  corresponding  to  the  loss  the 
system suffered by an attack action, and the 
recovery capability can mitigate this loss, so 
we weighted the mitigation by the formula: 

L′ = L − R                                      (2) 

Deceptive Capability (E): 
    The effect on increasing network security 
was  that  it  created  uncertainty  of  attack 
actions, so despite the damage of the attack 
action  was  fixed,  it  could  mitigate  the 
damage that the system or device suffered 
by  this  action.  According  to  this,  we 
calculated this capability by a payoff matrix: 

′ = 𝑃(𝑓|𝜑, 𝑓̃)𝑈𝑓 =

𝑈𝑓

𝜑𝑓,𝑓̃
𝑁𝑓̃

𝑈𝑓              (3) 

Where  𝑓   presented  the  true  fingerprint 
whereas  𝑓̃   presented 
the  observation 
fingerprint,  𝑁𝑓̃  was the total number of the 
devices  in  the  system  whose  observation 
fingerprint was  𝑓̃ and  𝜑𝑓,𝑓̃  was the defense 
configuration describing the number of the 
true fingerprint(𝑓)which observed as  𝑓̃. 
Tracing Capability (T): 
    The  tracing  capability  described  the 
capability of discovering the attack actions, 
and  this  paper  formalized  it  as  a  time-
related function: 
      𝑇(𝑡) = 𝛼 ∗ 𝑇 𝑡⁄                               (4) 
Whereαis  empirical  coefficient  and  T  is  a 
constant represent “Attack time” of a certain 
attack action.   
    Then  we  extended  the  utility  calculation 
formula based on (1), (2) and (4). 

Definition 4: The adversary utility functions 
were: 
𝑈𝑎,𝑑 = (𝐿 − 𝑅) ∗ 𝑉 − 𝑇(𝑡) 
            = (𝐿 − 𝑅) ∗ 𝑉 − 𝛼𝑇 𝑡⁄   (5) 
V represented the asset value and L can be 
divided  into  C  for  confidentiality,  I  for 
integrity and A for availability. 
-Calculating the payoff matrix 

ADSGM  was  a  zero-sum  game,  and  we 
regarded it as a matrix game with a Markov 
decision process[20], there was an example 
of a matrix game at state  𝑆𝑘:

This paper followed the previous study[20] 
using  Shapley  iterative  algorithm  to  solve 
formula  (6),  and  the  existence  theorem  of 
game value has been given which would not 

be repeated here. Now giving the algorithm:

Case study 

First, this paper supposed that there was 
a  typical  network  system  topology  as  fig2. 
The adversary could access client A and B by 
the  Internet,  and  there  was  a  firewall 
between the Internet and the intranet. The 
access  rules  of  the  firewall  were as  table  2 
listed.  In  particular,  the  shadow  asset  was 
the  “copy”  of 
it 
misdirected  adversary  perceptions  and 
decision processes.

Now, we assumed that the adversary had 
compromised client A, and recognized client 
A as an entrance node, then generated the 
system state set by Algorithm 1 and output 
the directed graph fig.3.   

Fig.3 Attack-defense stochastic game state

S0  was  the  system  state  that  client  A  had 
been  compromised,  the  adversary  actions 
set was A0= {a1, a2, a3, a4} and the defender 
actions set D0= {d1, d5}, where especially, d5

the  defender  actions  set  D2={d3,d5},  then 
give the original payoff matrix:

(100-0)*0-100=-100

(100-0)*0-100=-100 
after we using formula (6), then the payoff 
matrix will be as follow:

It  is  obvious  that  the  passive  defense 
measure reduces the utility of attack actions 
and  increase  the  security  of  the  target 
system. 
Finally  get  the  accumulated  payoff  of  the 
adversary, which is a negative correlation to 
the system security situation. 

Related Work 

Network  security  assessment 

is  an 
essential  problem  which  researchers  and 
businesses  have  been  always  concerned 
about, and many excellent studies has been 
proposed to solve this problem such as [2]–
[4], [21]–[24], [2], [3] using attack-graph to 
analysis the risk assessment, whereas some 
other  studies[4],  [21]–[24]  examine  the 
matter  from  different  angles.  For  example, 
[21]  use  D-S  theory  to  analyze  the  risk  of 
information  security,  [4]  try  to  solve  the 
same problem with a    probabilistic model, 
whereas  [22]  propose  a  new  method  to 
measure  the  impact  of  the  attack  mission 
and develop a tool based on it. what's more, 
[24]  propose a new  model to estimate the 
time  to  compromise  a  system  component 
that is visible to an attacker.   

In addition, game theory for security has 
been studied extensively based on a variety 
of  game  model,  and  many  of  them  [18], 
[25]–[27] try to using the stochastic game to 
solve  a  series  of  security  problem  which 
gives  us  much  inspiration.  Particularly,  [18] 
give the proof of the equilibrium extension 
in a stochastic n-person game. Besides, the 
game  theory  is  adept  at  the  evaluation  of 
attack-defense behaviors[10], [26], [28], [29] 
and the defense resource allocation[30], [31]. 
What’s more, the researches on estimating 
the  attack-defense  behaviors  in  a  system-
level  propose  a  new  angle  to  estimate  the 
system security degree[7], [8], [16], [20], [30]. 
[20]  proposed  an  feasibility  framework  to 
model  the  interactions  of  attack-defense 
behavior  and  system  state,  however  the 
effect  of  defense  still  have  not  discussed 
clearly,  which  may  lead  to  a  fault  in   
prediction and evaluation of attack-defense 
behaviors and [16] take the cost of behavior 
into  account  of  the  utility  calculation  and 
refer to the recovery capability of defensive 
measures. However, neither of them discuss 
the passive defense and the effect of  it  on 
the attack-defense interactions. 

Furthermore, researches like[32], [32], [33] 
has  shown  the  effective  and  important  of 
deception and [34] introduce a novel game-
theoretic model of deceptive interactions of 
the  adversary  and  the  defender  which 
inspire  this  paper  handling  the  passive 
defense  effects  on  the  system  security 
assessment.

calculation  and  we  take  a  case  study  to 
illustrate how it works and how important it 
is.  Finally,  3)  we  tentatively  put  forward  an 
idea of “attack time” which may be a helpful 
metric  to  measure  the  ability  of  attack 
detection and the attacker ability. 

Discussion 

This  paper  used  an  attack-defense 
stochastic  game  model  to  evaluate  the 
attack-defense  behaviors  and  the  security 
situation of the target system. Furthermore, 
previous studies rarely considered proactive 
defensive  measures  that  can  substantially 
influence the attack-defense behaviors and 
the  system  situation,  whereas  this  paper 
tentatively  put  forward  a  more  reasonable 
scheme,  which  distinguished  the  different 
ability  of  proactive  defense  measure  and 
passive defense measure and evaluated the 
utility of them in different ways. In addition, 
this  paper  tried  to  use  “attack  time”  to 
measure  the  risk  of  exposure  of  adversary 
and  the ability of  the defender to discover 
the attack behaviors. 

Compare  with  the  previous  work,  the 
this  paper  was 
most  contribution  of 
into 
considering  the  passive  measures 
account  and  subdivided  the  capability  of 
defense  measures,  and 
consequently 
increased  the  accuracy  of  the  system 
security evaluation. 

However,  it  should  note  that  this  study 
has examined only the feasibility of ADSGM, 
more  examination  will  be  conducted  on 
both  the  utility  and  on  more  complex  and 
larger target system in the future. 

Summary 

To sum up, first of all, 1) this paper studied 
the  influence  of  defensive  measures  on  an 
attack-defense  game  and  take  two  extra 
capability  of  defensive  measures 
into 
account of the evaluation of system security 
situation.  In  addition,  2)  we  put  forward  a 
method  on  proactive  defense  utility
