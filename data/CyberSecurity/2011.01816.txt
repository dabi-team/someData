As one of the largest and most complex systems on earth, power grid operation and control have
stepped forward as a compound analysis on both physical and cyber layers which makes it vul-
nerable to assaults from economic and security considerations. In order to accomplish reliable
power system control, it is necessary to do state estimation and bad data detection to remove the
erroneous measurement. A new type of attack, namely the combined data integrity-availability
attack, has recently been proposed, where the attackers can simultaneously manipulate and blind
some measurements on the supervisory control and data acquisition system to mislead the con-
trol operation and keep stealthy. Compared with traditional false data injection attacks, this
combined attack can further complicate and vitiate the model-based detection mechanism. To
detect such attack, this paper proposes a novel random denoising long short-term memory au-
toencoder framework, where the spatial-temporal correlations of measurements can be explicitly
captured and the unavailable data is countered by the random dropout layer. The proposed al-
gorithm is evaluated and the performance is veriﬁed on a 118-bus system under various unseen
attack attempts.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background

The emerging application of information and communication techniques (ICT) on power system automation, moni-
toring, and control has reformed the modern power gird into a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) [3]. Many ﬂexible
and artiﬁcial solutions are proposed to embrace the trend of electriﬁcation and digitalization at all cyber, physical, net-
work, and communication layers to allow two-way communication between facilities and customers [22, 48]. However,
this new opportunity also presents challenges in the safe and resilient operation of the cyber-physical power system
under cyberattacks [60]. Several cyber-physical attacks have been reported causing severe economic and human life
losses, among which the incidence taking place in Ukraine may be the most recognizable one. In December 2015,
more than 200k customers were inﬂuenced by the half-day grid blackout in Kiev. The follow-up investigation revealed
that the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) protocol was aﬀected by hackers [27].

Cyber-physical attacks can be classiﬁed according to their unique target and delivery methodologies [34], such as
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in the network and communication layers where information ﬂow packets are jammed
or lost. In particular, most of the recent research is focused on the False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) which can
be implemented on all four layers in cyber-physical power systems. Although FDIAs have been researched in many
directions, such as DC microgrid operation [4, 47], energy market[15], frequency regulation [7], and voltage regulation
[10], this paper mainly discusses FDIAs targetting on state estimation (SE). In principle, the control center retrieves
the operational states of individual buses by the measurements observed from the remote terminal unit (RTU) and/or
phasor measurement unit (PMU) in every few seconds to minutes. The estimated states are used in energy management
systems (EMS) for contingency analysis, automatic generation control (AGC), load forecasting, etc. [1]. Therefore,
FDIA is deﬁned as a direct manipulation on the measurements with the purpose of deviating the estimated state that
can mislead the EMS’s economic and stable operations [25, 30]. In the literature, the concept of stealth FDIA in DC
state estimation is ﬁrst veriﬁed in [31] where the attacker can bypass model-based Bad Data Detection (BDD) with
limited resources, even with protected RTUs. Later, FDIA on AC state estimation is proposed in [21] along with the

vulnerability analysis. FDI attacks for diﬀerent attack purposes are reviewed in [44] where the corresponding impacts
and detection frameworks are partially examined.

Broadly speaking, three hierarchical approaches can be implemented to counter the cyberphysical attacks, namely
protection, detection, and mitigation [2]. The protection is an attack prevention mechanism that can reject common
attack attempts. However, it is too hard and costly to protect all the RTUs in the grid and a complete attack rejection is
unrealistic [58]. The second stage is attack detection where model-based and data-driven algorithms are two prevalent
In [26], a tri-level optimization algorithm is proposed to
methods [34]. The third approach is attack mitigation.
restore the operation after attack with minimum restoration duration. As the dynamic power system model is hard
to track and construct, the model-based detection may easily fail on unseen attack attempts and suﬀer from detection
delay. Consequently, this paper focuses on the detection of cyber attacks using data-driven method while we leave the
discussions on the model-based methods in [34].

1.2. Review on Data-Driven Attack Detection

As the number and resolution of the grid measurements are improved, data-driven methods, such as statistical,
machine, and deep learning algorithms, are armed to simulate the complex dynamic and uncertainty of the system
behavior with few knowledge of the model. Here, we summarize the challenges involved in FDIA detection and
review potential solutions of data-driven algorithms in the literature.

(1) High dimensionality of measurements and features:
The dimension of the measured data increases as the topological complexity increases and the anomalies can
become hidden and unnoticeable. For example, bus-118 system may have more than 300 features for one sample
under DC state estimation while in AC, this number can be boosted to 1k. Due to the static nature of the power
system operation and sparse topology, directly changing on the estimated states can only lead to limited measurement
variations. Consequently, many statistical and machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)
[56], Naive Bayesian Classiﬁer (NBC) [12], Decision Trees (DT) [23], and 𝑘-NNs [61] usually fail to ﬁt in large
system with high dimensionality. As a result, dimension reduction or expert feature engineering is usually required for
machine learning methodologies in advance. However, the performance of selected features cannot be guaranteed for
anomaly detection purpose [38].

(2) Absence of positive measurement samples:
Power system operates under the optimal condition in most of the time which leads to the absence of real measured
anomalies at training stage. To enrich the balance-labelled dataset in supervised classiﬁcation, positive measurements
are generated artiﬁcially [11, 55]. However, in real-time, the attacks can be heterogeneous and there always exists un-
certain attack scenarios such that the trained model fails to converge. Due to the rarity of positive samples and the high
cost of collecting large number of labeled data, supervised learning is not applicable in practice [38]. Therefore, gen-
erative models, unsupervised, and weakly supervised learnings are proposed. In the generative model [63], new attack
signals can be generated according to the probabilistic distribution of the known attack samples where in unsupervised
and semi-supervised learnings, the anomaly detector is mainly trained to describe the normalities and any violations on
the acquired knowledge of ‘normality’ can be considered as the outliers. Ref. [2] implements the isolation forest (IF)
for unsupervised anomalous measurements detection. Moreover, the normality is examined by semi-supervised mix-
ture Gaussian distribution models in [13] but the anomaly scores are determined by the known attack patterns which
weakens its generality. Semi-supervised Support Vector Machine (S3VM) is considered in [35] under the assumption
that the diﬀerence between the number of normal and abnormal samples is not signiﬁcant. The simulation results of
these methods show a higher detection accuracy than common supervised techniques, such as SVM and 𝑘-NNs, to
some extents. However, they usually suﬀer from high false alarm rate [38] and roundabout training target [5].

(3) Mix of spatial and temporal correlations:
The RTU measurements can be considered as a multivariate time series and the anomalies involved can be point-
wise, contextual, and cumulative [6]. In detail, point anomalies are the isolated points that are distinguishable from the
majority of the data, e.g. a large but stealthy FDI attack. Using this idea, [33] detects the attacks based on convolutional
neural net. Contextual anomalies can only be detected in a certain temporal environment. An extreme example would
be the replay attack [32]. A sub-sequence of the data can be regarded as collective anomalies if it is distinctive to
the other instances, e.g., small but stealthy oscillations on the measurements. As the isolated detection on a single
measurement mainly focuses on the spatial complexity, it is likely to fail on some attack occasions mentioned above.
Apart from the spatial complexity, it has been reported that the temporal correlations on loads and distributed
generators (DG) can reﬂect on the grid operation and inﬂuence on the accuracy of state estimation [64]. As a result,

prediction-aided detection is considered in [55, 65] where the estimated measurement error is found by the predicted
states. It should be trivially noticed that, prediction-based detection can beneﬁt on anomaly mitigation by replacing the
contaminations with the estimated values. However, as the attacks are usually sparse in the power grid, disregarding all
the latest information can also discard the spatial correlations on the normal data, which may deteriorate the detection
performance. Another research direction leads to the density-based methodology. Small but successive attacks have
been considered in [46] where data transformation and Kullback–Leibler divergence are implemented to capture the
measurement temporal variations while in [59], the slopes of the adjacent measurements are classiﬁed by decision trees
and spectral clustering. However, many of the aforementioned methods only consider the one-step dependence of the
measurement dynamics while few can explicitly investigate the spatiotemporal complexity and report the detection
accuracy under various unseen attack attempts.

(4) Robust detection against combined attacks:
To facilitate FDIA, the attacker may simultaneously blind a certain part of the measurements by launching an
availability or so-called DoS attack, which improves the assault furtiveness and relieves the attack eﬀorts [36, 37, 49].
From the resilient point of view, this complicates the detection where the missing data can be either part of the combined
integrity-availability attack or caused by the measurement malfunctioning. As a result, static detection algorithm
cannot be generalized due to the destruction of the spatial relationships. The goal of the combined attack detection
is to give robust estimation on the observed measurements under varying combined attack strengths and missing data
ratios. Although the vulnerability analysis has been investigated on the combined attacks, few attention has been paid
to the practical detection and mitigation solutions.

1.3. Deep Autoencoder-Based Anomaly Detection

In recent years, deep anomaly detection (DNN) has been introduced to numerous practical ﬁelds, such as fraud
detection and network intrusion [5]. It also leads to a superior detection performance than the aforementioned tradi-
tional methods in power system, such as [17, 39, 55]. Among all of the DNN applications, deep autoencoder (AE) and
its variations have been comprehensively used for feature extraction, dimension reduction, and network pretraining in
many machine learning tasks due to its straightforward network structure, unlabelled training requirement, robust, and
high-dimensional nonlinear mapping properties [18]. As a result, AE-based anomaly detection has become a over-
whelming cornerstone. For the attack detection in power systems, point-wise anomaly detection is considered in [52]
while a probabilistic inference is further added by [28]. Ref. [8] further extends the AE with Gaussian Mixture Model.
The AE detection method explicitly learns the spatial relationships in the measurements while neglecting the temporal
correlations. To retrieve the temporal correlations, recurrent neural network (RNN) with diﬀerent realizations can be
considered to replace the dense AE layers. However, the previous applications of deep autoencoder-based detection
algorithm assumes the full availability of measurement data, which does not hold in the case of combined integrity
and availability attack.

With the aforementioned challenges (Section 1.2) in mind, this paper proposes a new Random Denoising LSTM-

AE (LSTM-RDAE) based algorithm for power system anomaly detection with the following contributions:

• Semi-supervised autoencoder is applied to only learn the normalities of the power system measurement (chal-
lenge 2) where the deep network structure can automatically ﬁt on the high-dimensional and nonlinear measure-
ments without prior model knowledge (challenge 1).

• We introduce the recurrent LSTM layer in the encoder-decoder network to explicitly extract the temporal cor-
relations among successive measurements (challenge 3). To cope with the availability attacks and improve the
robustness, complete random dropout is applied on each sample per epoch (challenge 4).

• We simulate the model by using real-time load proﬁles on IEEE bus-118. Our method allows a real-time anomaly
detection with moderate computational burden. We also consider a broad unseen attack types by considering
both the attacker’s eﬀort and diﬀerent attack strength. The simulation results depict that the proposed LSTM-
RDAE can outperform the state-of-art semi-/unsupervised machine learning and deep learning methods.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Power system model and combined integrity-availability attacks
are formulated in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the proposed LSTM-RDAE for combined attack detection. The
simulation set-up and results are summarised in Section 4 while this article ends with a conclusion in Section 5.

2. Problem Formulation
2.1. State Estimation

The power grid can be modelled as an undirected graphic network. The generator and demand consist as the nodal
buses and the electric power can ﬂow along the transmission lines. A centralized control center can monitor and control
the gird operations by collecting nodal and line measurements from RTUs and PMUs. In a large power system, the
main objective of the control center is to ﬁnd the optimal real and reactive powers of each generator such that all the
demands are met under the minimal cost while the system constraints are not violated. This generation planning is
called as optimal power ﬂow (OPF) [43].

State estimation (SE) functions as the core to maintain normal and safe operations in power system. Given redun-
dant measurements, the voltage phasors are estimated through the system equations. Let the system state as 𝑥 ∈ ℝ𝑛
and the measurement as 𝑧 ∈ ℝ𝑚 with 𝑚 > 𝑛, the system equations can be represented as [1]:

𝑧 = ℎ(𝑥) + 𝑒

[𝑒1, 𝑒2, … , 𝑒𝑚
where 𝑒𝑇 =
the measurement index set.

(1)
] is the independent zero-mean measurement errors and deﬁne  = {𝑖|𝑖 = 1, 2, ⋯ , 𝑚} as

The weighted least square (WLS) algorithm is usually applied to ﬁnd the states by minimising:

𝐽 (̂𝑥) = [𝑧 − ℎ(̂𝑥)]𝑇 𝐸−1[𝑧 − ℎ(̂𝑥)]

(2)

where 𝐸 ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑚 is the covariance matrix of the i.i.d. measurement noises and ̂𝑥 is the estimated state. As solving (2)
requires iterative minimization, a DC approximation on (1) is commonly implemented:

𝑧 = 𝐻𝑥 + 𝑒

(3)

where 𝐻 ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑛 is the measurement matrix.
[𝜃2, ⋯ , 𝜃𝑛] where 𝜃1 = 0 is the reference state. The analytic WLS solution of (3) is given as

In DCSE, the system state only consists of voltage phases: 𝑥 =

̂𝑥 = (𝐻 𝑇 𝐸−1𝐻)−1𝐻 𝑇 𝐸−1𝑧

(4)

2.2. Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks

One of the essential functions of SE is to detect, identify, and eliminate any errors occurring in the measurements.
Traditionally, the measurement errors can be caused by sensor inaccuracy and malfunctioning. With the emerging
of cyber-physical layers, the SE and BDD are also equipped to detect possible cyber attacks. Firstly, the estimation
residual is found as:

2
𝑟(𝑧) = ‖𝑧 − 𝐻 ̂𝑥‖
2

(5)

If (5) is normally distributed on diﬀerent 𝑧, a Chi-square 𝜒 2 algorithm can be applied with 𝑚 − 𝑛 freedoms. More

directly, a heuristic threshold 𝜏 can be determined according to the normal measurements and the BDD is given as:

𝐷1(𝑧) =

{

1
0

if 𝑟(𝑧) ≥ 𝜏1
otherwise

where an attack alarm is indicated by 1.

(6)

In this article, an FDIA is considered by directly intruding vector 𝑐 ∈ ℝ𝑛−1 on the estimated state ̂𝑥 [2]. To
successfully achieve the attack goal and also keep stealthy to the BDD, the injected measurement vector should be in
the column space of 𝐻 [31]:

𝑎 = 𝐻𝑐,

∀𝑐 ∈ ℝ𝑛−1

(7)

This stealth FIDA indeed requires a strong condition where the attacker should know the exact system topology
and line parameters. In practice, the attacker may also consider to land a series of assaults as long as the attack model

2
‖𝑎 − 𝐻𝑐‖
2

≤ 𝜏1 − ||𝑧 − 𝐻 ̂𝑥||

2
2

holds [65, 66].

2.3. Combined Integrity-Availablity Attacks

Assume a single attack attempt has been imposed on the 𝑖th bus by amount 𝜇 such that

𝑐(𝑘) =

{ 𝜇
0

if 𝑘 = 𝑖
otherwise

(9)

where 𝑐(𝑘) represents the 𝑘th elements of vector 𝑐. According to the stealth attack principle (7), a possible attack
vector can be formulated as:

𝑎 = 𝜇𝐻(∶, 𝑖)

(10)

where 𝐻(∶, 𝑖) represents the 𝑖th column of Jacobian 𝐻. Let 𝛿(𝑖) = |𝐻(∶, 𝑖)|0
be the degree of bus 𝑖, it can be directly
shown that the above attack attempt is a sparsest upper bound [21, 40] with respect to the 𝑖th state. The index set of
𝑎 = {𝑗|𝐻(𝑗, 𝑖) ≠ 0}. Generally, the FDIA is intensive and costly as the
the contaminated measurements becomes 
intruder has to know the system knowledge and impose the attack vector on the real measurement. On the contrary,
an availability attack is much cheaper as sensor failure can be easily achieved at both physical and cyber sides. In
[37, 36, 49], the attacker aims to inject on a particular measurement where the remaining measurements in the sparsest
critical tuple set are covered to minimize the attack eﬀort. Let 𝑑 ∈ {0, 1}𝑚 be the availability attack vector and
𝑑(𝑘) = 1 indicates that the 𝑘th measurement is not available, i.e. the availability attack set is 
𝑑 = {𝑘|𝑑(𝑘) = 1}.
The measurement matrix will be reduced to 𝐻𝑟 = (𝐼 − diag(𝑑))𝐻 implying that the 𝑘th row of 𝐻 becomes null. In
this article, the availability attack strength is deﬁned as 𝛾 = |𝑑|0∕𝑚. Two constraints are considered when applying
availability attack on the predeﬁned FDIAs:

1. The dropped 𝑘𝑡ℎ measurement should not be critical, and
2. 
Condition 1) ensures that the reduced matrix 𝐻𝑟

are disjoint, i.e. 

𝑑 = 𝜙.

𝑎 ∩ 

and 

𝑑

𝑎

is still observable [1]. Although pseudo-measurements can be
imputed on the missing measurements, the deviation of the estimated states can be enlarged if the availability attack
continues. It should be pointed out that the control center cannot outcome the desired state contamination 𝜇 on state 𝑖
(9) if the measurements in 
are unavailable. As shown by condition 2), the low-cost availability attack in this article
𝑎
is introduced to improve the stealthness of the FDIAs and mislead the detection algorithm, which is diﬀerent to the
settings in [36, 37].

To classify diﬀerent availability attacks, the concept of missing data in statistics is adopted. Two measurement
blinding mechanisms are considered in particular, named as missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at
random (MAR) [41]. In MCAR, all the measurements have the same probability to lose and the missing proportion is
that depends neither on the property nor the value of the measurement. In
a random subset of the measurements  ⧵ 
contrast, MAR or conditional missing is deﬁned by the observed property of individual measurement. For instance, the
adversaries may intend to cover certain measurements that are more related to 
to keep furtive. Detailed constructions
𝑎
on 
will be described in Section 4. The detection algorithm will be trained under MCAR condition whereas both
MCAR and MAR will be evaluated during the test stage. Furthermore, we assume that the attacker has full system
knowledge including meter measurement data, measurement matrix 𝐻, and the BDD strategy. Besides, the attacked
measurements are assumed to be able to bypass the BDD test (6).

3. Detection Methodology

Load proﬁles are continuously changing in power system due to varying customer behaviours, weather conditions,
and dispatch policies. This dependency can be reﬂected by the correlations of loads at diﬀerent time which also implies
the correlations on states and measurements [54]. As a result, dynamic behaviour has been considered in [53, 55, 65, 66]
to aid on anomaly detection by predictive models. However, most of them only consider one-step temporal correlation
and the knowledge on the current measurements can be barely applied to the prediction model. In general, the dynamic
anomaly detection at time 𝑡 considering past 𝑇 − 1 measurements can be formulated by a look-ahead residual:

𝑟′(𝑧𝑡) =

1
𝑇

𝑡
∑

𝑖=𝑡−𝑇 +1

2
‖𝑧𝑖 − ̂𝑧𝑖‖
2

(11)

where the dynamic on the measurements is governed by ̂𝑧𝑖 = 𝑙(̂𝑧𝑡, … , ̂𝑧𝑡−𝑇 +1) for ∀𝑖 = 𝑡 − 𝑇 + 1, … , 𝑡. However, the
explicit expression on 𝑙(⋅) is hard to ﬁnd. As a result, deep learning method is applied to capture the correlations in
measurements together with the anomaly detection purpose on measurement 𝑧𝑡

A Deep Learning based Detection Method for Combined Integrity-Availability Cyber Attacks in Power System

3.1. LSTM-Autoencoder

Given a multivariate dataset  = {𝑧<1>, 𝑧<2>, … , 𝑧<𝑁>} where 𝑧<𝑖> ∈ ℝ𝑚 has 𝑚 attributes and a decision space
 ⊂ ℝ𝑚ℎ with 𝑚ℎ < 𝑚, a commonly-used deep anomaly detection framework is to learn a nonlinear feature mapping
𝑓 (⋅; Θ) ∶  ↦  which can imply anomaly score basing on the learnt knowledge in feature space . The nonlinear
mapping is achieved by stacked network layers, nonlinear activation functions, and the trainable weights and biases
Θ = {, }.

In a nutshell, an autoencoder is a neural network that is trained to reconstruct its input at the output layer. It
consists of two dense networks. For each of the sample 𝑧<𝑖>, an encoder ℎ<𝑖> = 𝑓𝑒(𝑧<𝑖>; Θ𝑒) is applied to code the
input features into the hidden layer ℎ<𝑖> ∈ ℝ𝑚ℎ with lower dimension while a decoder can then retrieve the inputs
by decoding function ̃𝑧<𝑖> = 𝑓𝑑(ℎ<𝑖>; Θ𝑑) [16]. As a result, AE creates a bottleneck for the data where only the
signiﬁcant structural information can go through and be reconstructed. Assumption is made such that the encoded
feature can learn nonlinear correlations on the input dataset that are suﬃcient for separating the anomalies. Since the
encoded hidden feature is compact and compressed, only the normal data can be successfully reconstructed by the
decoder - thus, anomalies and outliers can be distinguished directly [42]:

where Θ𝑒
are training parameters in encoder and decoder networks. Reconstruction error 𝑆(𝑧) is the anomaly
score assigned to measurement 𝑧 once the network is trained. Subscript 𝑖 is omitted in (12) for brevity. Similarly to
the BDD (6), the decision threshold 𝜏2
can be found according to the distribution of the reconstruction error on the
validation set and the detection principle is set as:

𝐷2(𝑧) =

{

1
0

if 𝑆(𝑧) ≥ 𝜏2
otherwise

(13)

While the autoencoder has proven to be useful for anomaly detection where only the normal measurements are
collected to train the network, it can only detect point outliers and overlook the temporal correlations between samples,
e.g. the contextual and cumulative anomalies. To explicitly extract the temporal correlations, recurrent neural network
(RNN) is used to replace the feedforward networks in both encoder and decoder. In RNN, the impact of the previous
input can be recorded and new features are learnt recursively in each training sample [16]. Perhaps, the most eﬀective
recurrent model in practice is LSTM [20]. To deal with the long-term gradient vanishing and explosion problem,
LSTM can automatically update and forget the state in each cell.

Consider a length 𝑇 continuous subset of : 

𝑖 = {𝑧<𝑡𝑖>, 𝑧<𝑡𝑖+1>, ⋯ , 𝑧<𝑡𝑖+𝑇 −1>} with 𝑡𝑖

the activation 𝑎<𝑡> are updated by the current input 𝑧<𝑡>, the previous state 𝑐<𝑡−1>, and previous activation 𝑎<𝑡−1>.
The LSTM cells are initiated statelessly by 𝑎<𝑡𝑖−1> = 𝑐<𝑡𝑖−1> = 0. Following (14), the useful information in the past
can always be kept by the update gate and the unworthy one will be forgotten by the forget gate. In our problem, this
suggests that the temporal correlations that are critical for normality representation are extracted through a window of
length 𝑇 .

3.2. Random Dropout Layer

Conventionally, denoising autoencoder (DAE) is used to train the network to learn more ‘intelligently’ on the
hidden features instead of trivial mapping. Noisy layer, such as Gaussian noise mask and dropout mask [51], is added
directly on the input and a nonlinear mapping is trained to reconstruct the clean input signal:

𝑓𝐷𝐴𝐸 ∶ 𝑓𝑑

; Θ∗

(16)

where 𝑧 is the corrupted version of 𝑧. In this article, the dropout mask is applied to quantify the process of missing
mechanism on normal data. Though in real life, the missing ratio can be known by the control center whenever the
current measurements are available, its value 𝛾 can be varying continuously. Unavoidably, this requires the control
center to have the detection model on each missing ratio case which is computational unattractive, lack of redundancy,
and may also cause overﬁtting problem. Inspired by DAE [50], the basic idea of the completely random dropout on
the input layer is to use the Monte-Carlo method to model all possible data missing ratios in range [𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑛, 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥].

During each training epoch, a random dropout mask 𝐷𝑖

is applied on the 𝑖𝑡ℎ sample to give the corrupted counter-

To control the complexity in simulation, we assume that the previous missing measurements have been imputed

Remark 1. We refer the autoencoder-based anomaly detection as semi-supervised as only the normal measurements
are required to train the network. This has fundamental diﬀerences to the unsupervised learning as the exact positive
and negative labels cannot be known in advance [38].

Remark 2. Though sharing with certain similar ideas, our method, as a new DAE [50] application on modelling
normal missing data, is diﬀerent to [14] where the ﬁxed forward and recurrent dropout ratios are used to approximate
the variational inference. It also varies from the sparse LSTM-AE [24] and ensemble RandNet [9] in which the multiple
networks with random and independent disconnections in the hidden layers are applied.

3.3. Discussions on LSTM-RDAE

In this section, we intuitively explain why applying sequential information can improve the performance of DAE
for combined attack detection. Referring to the manifold assumption [51], high-dimensional data locates around some
certain low-dimensional manifolds (such as the solid black curve in Fig.3). The autoencoder can be interpreted as
regenerating a similar manifold (dashed black curve) to catch the projected sequential data. The encoder representation
𝑙𝑒( ⋅ ; Θ𝑒) can thus be argued as a certain projection pattern at this lower manifold space. When dropout is applied,
the deviation between 
is ampliﬁed in the lower space, i.e. the distance to the manifold increases. As shown
by Fig. 3, the previous uncorrupted measurements can help guide the reconstructed manifold up to the incoming
corruption by learning their temporal correlations even under various dropout ratios.

4. Experiment Set-ups and Results

In this section, we evaluate the performance of LSTM-RDAE algorithm for combined attack detection problem.

4.1. Data Acquisition, Reﬁnement, and Analysis

We use some common settings in literature to prepare the training dataset. To simulate the most realistic situation
and obtain high-resolution real-time measurements and states, 11 distinct European regional load proﬁles in year 2015-
2017 with 15min observation interval are collected from an open-source dataset [19]. Firstly, the missing data is
roughly imputed by the last-day’s load at the same time. To have a reasonable proﬁle range, for each regional load
pattern, a random maximum load consumption 𝑙𝑖,max

is applied [62]:

Figure 4: One day load proﬁle for the ﬁrst 10 out of 99 loads in bus-118 system

IEEE bus-118 test system [67] is used as the simulation platform which contains 99 loads and 54 generators in
total. To map the 11 distinct load proﬁles into 99 load buses and keep their individual pattern, symmetric Dirichlet
distribution [52] with a low distribution parameter 𝑎 = 0.2 is applied. Furthermore, as in general the state estimation
can be processed in less than 5min, two more load points are interpolated within the successive 15min data with 2%
variations added. Consequently, each bus has 288 load data a day accounting for 210528 temporally continuous load
data in total, e.g. in Fig.4. After obtaining the  ∈ ℝ99×210528 loads, AC-OPF is operated with the speciﬁed active
power demand. The power factor is found as the default value with 5% variations [46, 62]. To increase the randomness,
stepped quadratic generator costs are applied at each node. The remaining parameters, system topology, and operational
constraints are set as defaults as in MATPOWER bus-118 description ﬁle [67]. At each time 𝑘, the AC-OPF gives the
solution to line power ﬂows 𝑃𝑓 ∈ ℝ186 and power generations 𝑃𝑔 ∈ ℝ54. Then the modiﬁed measurement vector can
be further found by

applied on the raw measurement data into range [0, 1] across samples.

As discussed in Section 2, diﬀerent buses have diﬀerent venerability degrees 𝛿 under FDIAs which can also reﬂect
on the attack eﬀorts. For the IEEE bus-118 system under DC assumption, the degree can vary from 𝛿 = 3 at bus 10,
73, 87, 111, 112, 116, and 117 up to 𝛿 = 22 at bus 49. If 𝛿 = 3, the targeted bus is connected to one other bus and
changing the state will only eﬀect on the two buses’ states and the line power between them which makes the attack
hard to detect in general.

4.2. Model Settings and Parameter Tuning

In general, it is not conspicuous to train the semi supervised LSTM-RDAE algorithm before the detection accuracy
is counted by applying the scoring credit (15) since the anomalies are not supposed to know in advance. Thus, as one
of the baseline methods, we pretrain an vanilla autoencoder method with full measurement information. Three metrics
are considered throughout the training and evaluation procedures: (a). True Positive Rate (TPR) which counts for the
ratio of the predicted positive samples over the actual positive samples, (b). False Positive Rate (FPR) which counts
for the predicted positive samples over the actual negative samples (the false alarm), and (c). the 𝐹1
score which is
deﬁned by:

(1). The precision 𝑃 𝑟𝑒: the proportion of the correctly predicted anomalies in all the predicted anomalies

𝑃 𝑟𝑒 = 𝑇 𝑃 ∕(𝑇 𝑃 + 𝐹 𝑃 )

(2). The recall 𝑅𝑒𝑐: the proportion of the correctly predicted anomalies in all the true anomalies

𝑅𝑒𝑐 = 𝑇 𝑃 ∕(𝑇 𝑃 + 𝐹 𝑁)

(3). The 𝐹 1-score: the harmonic mean of 𝑃 𝑟𝑒 and 𝑅𝑒𝑐

𝐹1

score = 2 × 𝑃 𝑟𝑒 × 𝑅𝑒𝑐∕(𝑃 𝑟𝑒 + 𝑅𝑒𝑐)

(21)

(22)

(23)

Note that for a competitive classiﬁer, the 𝐹1

-score should approach to 1. The core hyperparameters in AE network
is the hidden feature dimension, the number of layers, and the activation functions. We test a wide range of these
parameters where nonlinear activations and compression hidden features are designed in particular to avoid trivial
feature extraction. We then give some beneﬁts to vanilla AE by supervised training. In detail, the hyperparameters are
tuned using grid search method by evaluating its best 𝐹1
score. The optimal hyperparameters are then implemented
directly to the LSTM-RDAE. Table 1 records the hyperparameters for LSTM-RDAE guided by vanilla AE where the
training epoch is tuned to have similar loss as AE. The sample length 𝑇 = 6 is chosen since the successive attack
is usually assumed to last for at most three steps [59]. Further enlarging the sample length will dilute the impact of
isolated anomalous point thus reduce the detection accuracy. Accordingly, the training samples in LSTM-RDAE are
separated by sliding window [57] of length-6, step-1 so that a 

𝐿𝑆𝑇 𝑀 ∈ ℝ304×6×210523 tersor can be constructed.

The random input dropout rate is set as 𝑑𝑚𝑖𝑛 = 0 to simulate the condition where no availability attack is imposed. In
a bus-14 example, 3 up to 12 out of the 55 total measurements can be dropped to hide an FDIA on a single measurement
[36] and this number can rise to 36 if a coordinated attack is considered [49]. Without losing generality, the maximum

A Deep Learning based Detection Method for Combined Integrity-Availability Cyber Attacks in Power System

missing ratio is set as 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 0.2 in our situation. Moreover, feedforward dropouts [14] are added in the encoder
hidden layers to avoid overﬁtting in LSTM-RDAE. The training and validation process is operated on the ﬁrst-year’s
data which is randomly partitioned into 𝑇 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛
𝐿𝑆𝑇 𝑀 = 0.8 ∶ 0.2 and the trained network will be evaluated
solely on the second year’s data for both normality and anomaly. To sum up, attacked measurements of diﬀerent kinds

4.3. Stealthy Combined Integrity-Availability Attacks With Limited Resources

In this section, we follow the similar attack patterns in [2] where only a speciﬁc single estimated state on every
bus except bus 69 (as the slack) can be contaminated according to stealth attack model (10), as we are aiming to ﬁnd
the most general detection algorithm. Each single state can vary in set ± [3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%]. For the
one-shot (point) attacks, the averaged metric is calculated over all the 117 attack cases under diﬀerent FDIA strengths
and availability attack ratios.

𝐹 𝑃 𝑅 is equivalent to their corresponding 𝛼th quantile, i.e. 𝐹 𝑃 𝑅(𝛼) + 𝛼 ≈ 1, regardless of the varying ratios which
suggests that the proposed LSTM-RDAE can overcome the overﬁtting problem and give a better representation on the
unseen measurements.

deteriorated when 𝛾 increases. This observation obeys the assumption that imposing availability attack on the FDIA

can improve the assault stealthy level. Furthermore, the 𝐹1

4.3.2. Model Veriﬁcation

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the LSTM-RDAE compared with other state-of-art deep and ma-
chine learning algorithms. In particular, we investigate how the temporal information can support the detection process
with and without availability attacks. As the detection on combined attacks are barely researched in literature, we mod-
ify the existing method on FDIA detection as follows:

• Baseline 1: DAE by adding denoising layers in the AE-based detector in [52] and [8];

• Baseline 2: LSTM-AE by replacing the dense layers with the LSTM layers in [52];

• Baseline 3: One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) as an extension to the S3VM in [35];

• Baseline 4: Isolation Forest (IF) in [2].

The comparisons between the proposed LSTM-RDAE and the above baselines are recorded in Table 3 assuming
a full measurement condition. To have a fare comparison, we also add random input dropout mask on DAE during
training. The objective of OC-SVM is to ﬁnd a hyperplane that has the maximum margin separating the high dimen-
sional data with the origin [45]. The RBF kernel method is used in OC-SVM to measure the nonlinearity. Successive
random hyper-separations are applied in IF [2, 29] where the abnormal data can be automatically picked out with less
steps if they are rare and distinctive. Ensemble isolation trees (iTrees) are constructed to ﬁnd the average anomaly
score. The two ML models are trained solely on the normalities in the semi-supervised manner and the contamination
ratios (similar to the quantile deﬁned in AE-based methods) are tuned to have 5% 𝐹 𝑃 𝑅 on the validation set. Principle

component analysis (PCA) is applied in advance on the scaled training data to reduce the data dimension. In our ex-
ample, we train the MLs under supervised awareness and it suggests that the ﬁrst 26 out of 304 components can cover
99% variances thus can give the best performance. In the simulation, it is assumed that the missing attributes have
been imputed, i.e. 𝛾 = 0.00. The suggested hyperparameters for MLs are recorded in Table 4.

As shown by Table 3, the performances of three deep learning methods can signiﬁcantly outperform the OC-
SVM and IF’s. Even under intense attack strength, both the OC-SVM’s and the IF’s detection rates are relatively
low. Firstly, as real-time load proﬁles are considered, diﬀerent loads have diﬀerent ranges and tendencies so that the
obtained measurements are more complex and temporally correlated (Fig.4) that may exceed the ML’s competence.
In the meanwhile, the ﬁrst 26 components are considered through PCA which is still high for machine learning algo-
rithms. Secondly, IF is set to be semi-supervised which leverages its separation eﬀects on the unseen attack samples.
Furthermore, the 𝑇 𝑃 𝑅 of the proposed method is slightly lower than LSTM-AE as the cost of considering all avail-
ability attack possibilities during training. It suggests that if there is no availability attack, LSTM-AE can be safely
implemented for detection. As the FDIA becomes more intense, the assaults turn to be less stealthy to the control
center and the diﬀerence between these two methods becomes negligible.

Table 5 evaluates the 𝑇 𝑃 𝑅s of LSTM-AE, DAE, and the proposed LSTM-RDAE under varying FDIAs and avail-
ability attack ratios. Firstly, the detection strategy of LSTM-AE follows the method in Section 4.3. As it is trained
without specifying missing input condition, LSTM-AE is leveraged by the large false alarm causing the lowest detec-
tion rate of the three methods. In all attack scenarios in Table 3 and 5, the proposed algorithm outperforms the DAE,
especially when the FDIAs are small and 𝛾s are large (highlighted in red) which veriﬁes that the temporal correlations
extracted by the recursive LSTM cells can give more conﬁdence on the unavailable measurements as discussed in Fig.
3.

4.3.3. Small and Successive Attacks

Temporal correlation is examined in this section where slight but successive attacks are considered to investigate
the detection performance on the cumulative anomalies. In detail, a single attack with small attack vector may be
harmless to the safety operation but their compound impacts should not be overlooked. Here, the attacks are assumed
to last for at most three steps [59].

Fig.9 simulate the LSTM-RDAE under various successive combined attack strengths. As the missing ratio grows,
the detection on one-shot attack becomes harder and the improvement on the detection rate introduced by successive
anomalies becomes more signiﬁcant, i.e. the detection rate on the three-step attacks (pink curves) are similar in all three
conditions (a)-(c) no matter the missing ratio 𝛾. Fig.9(d) highlights the condition of selected buses with low detection
rate when one-shot 10% false data and 20% missing ratios are injected. In majority of these buses, the detection rates
when at most three steps are considered can be boosted by 10% to 25% compared with the one-shot attack and 20% to
50% compared with the DAE.

4.3.4. FDIAs under Targeted Availability Attacks

In the previous sections, the measurements are lost completely at random (MCAR) while in practice, the attacker
may blind a certain area of RTUs to mislead the control center. Meanwhile, it is also realistic to have missing data
around a central junctional-node. To test the algorithm robustness on targeted availability attacks, the measurements
are attacked according to their state degrees, thus leading to an MAR scheme. For the 𝑖th state, we deﬁne its attack
neighborhood 

𝑎(𝑖) as the set containing the measurements directly connected to the contaminated measurements:



𝑎(𝑖) = {𝑗|𝐻(𝑗, 𝑖) ≠ 0}

(24a)

𝑎(𝑖) are still available to the control center. In Table 6, FDIAs with %𝜇 = 0.10

percentage on the proposed algorithm is smaller than it in DAE, which again veriﬁes the assumption in Fig.3. In the
worst case, 77% detection rate is still maintained. It is worth to note that diﬀerent buses can have distinct sensitivities
on the availability attack types and strengths, due to their various degrees and topological conﬁgurations.

4.3.5. Stealth Replay Attacks

If the attacker is located at the control center, e.g. an internal intruder, he might have access to the previous mea-
surements to impose the replay attack [34]. To improve the attack stealthness, we assume that the current measurement
is replaced by the measurement at the same time of the previous day, e.g. 𝑧𝑎(𝑡) = 𝑧 (𝑡 − 𝑡0
) where 𝑡0 = 288. Although

it has been argued that the replay attack may not be practical to the attacker in real life [65, 66], in general it serves as
the strongest stealthy assault to bypass both BDD (6), (8) and the point detection algorithm, such as DAE. Indeed, the
replay attack can be seen as an FDIA with 𝑎(𝑡) = 𝑧𝑎(𝑡) − 𝑧(𝑡) and the estimated state variation can be calculated by
(4). As a result, replay attack is tested as an theoretical instance of contextual anomaly.

The simulation results on one-shot replay attacks are illustrated in Table 7 under diﬀerent 𝛾s. The detection rates
of DAE are around 5% which are similar to the predeﬁned 𝐹 𝑃 𝑅 (= 5%) during the model veriﬁcation stage. Thanks
to the temporal exploitation property in LSTM cells, the proposed algorithm can achieve detection rate on the replay
attack between 84% and 72% depending on the diﬀerent rate of missing data.

5. Conclusions

This paper investigates a semi-supervised detection algorithm for combined integrity-availability attack in power
system where model knowledge, sample labelling, and preliminaries on the attack patterns are not required. We formu-
late the availability attack to further improve the stealth of FDIAs that can confuse the control option and deteriorate
the false alarm ratio. The proposed LSTM-RDAE is pure data-driven and can explicitly ﬁt on the spatiotemporal com-
plexities in the normal measurement sequences. Moreover, a completely random dropout layer is designed after the
input layer to evaluate the varying availability attack ratios. The performance of the proposed detection framework
is veriﬁed under IEEE 118-bus system where real-time load proﬁles are employed. Sensitivity analysis is given for
parameter tuning while various unseen combined attack scenarios, e.g. one-shot and successive state attack, target
availability attack, and stealth replay attack are simulated during the test stage. By controlling the FPR under 5%, the
simulation results verify that the proposed LSTM-RDAE is more accurate with approximate 95% detection rate under
moderate attacks and more robust than the state-of-art deep machine learning counterparts in literature.
