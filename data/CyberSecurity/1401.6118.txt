Abstract—Authorship  Identification  techniques  are  used  to 
identify  the  most  appropriate  author  from  group  of  potential 
suspects  of  online  messages  and  find  evidences  to  support  the 
online 
conclusion.  Cybercriminals  make  misuse 
communication for sending blackmail or a spam email and then 
attempt to hide their true identities to void detection.Authorship 
Identification  of  online  messages  is  the  contemporary  research 
issue  for  identity  tracing  in  cyber  forensics.  This  is  highly 
interdisciplinary area as it takes advantage of machine learning, 
information  retrieval,  and  natural  language  processing.  In  this 
paper, a study of recent techniques and automated approaches to 
attributing authorship of online messages is presented. The focus 
of  this  review  study  is  to  summarize  all  existing  authorship 
identification techniques used in literature to identify authors of 
online  messages.  Also 
it  discusses  evaluation  criteria  and 
parameters  for  authorship  attribution  studies  and  list  open 
questions that will attract future work in this area. 

Keywords—cyber crime; Author Identification; SVM

INTRODUCTION  

Cyber crime is also known as computer crime, the use of a 
computer  to  further  illegal  ends,  such  as  committing  fraud, 
trafficking  in  child  pornography  and  intellectual  property, 
stealing identities, or violating privacy.  

Cybercrime,  especially  through the  Internet, has grown  in 
importance as the computer has become central to commerce, 
entertainment,  and  government.  Senders  can  hide 
their 
identities  by  forging  sender’s  address;  Routed  through  an 
anonymous  server  and  by  using  multiple  usernames  to 
distribute online messages via different anonymous channel. 

Author  Identification  study  is  useful  to  identify  the  most 
plausible  authors  and  to  find  evidences  to  support  the 
conclusion. 

Authorship analysis problem is categorized as [13] 

1)  Authorship  identification  (authorship  attribution):  It 
determines the likelihood of a piece of writing to be produced 
by  a  particular  author  by  examining  other  writings  by  that 
author. 

2)  Authorship  characterization:  It  summarizes 
the 
characteristics  of  an  author  and  generates  the  author  profile 
based  on  his/her  writings  like  Gender,  educational,  cultural 
background, and writing style 

3) 

Similarity  detection:  It  compares  multiple  pieces  of 
writing  and  determines  whether  they  were  produced  by  a 
single  author  without  actually  identifying  the  author  like 
Plagiarism detection. To extract unique writing style from the 
number  of  online  messages  various  features  need  to  be 
considered  are  Lexical 
features, 
,Content-specific 
Syntactic 
features  

features,  content-free 
features 

,Structure 

features 

Although  authorship  attribution  problem  has  been  studied 
in  the  history  but  in  the  last  few  decades,  authorship 
attribution  of  online  messages  has  become  a  forthcoming 
research area as it is confluence of various research areas like 
machine learning, information Retrieval and Natural Language 
Processing.  Initially  this  problem  started  as  the  most  basic 
problem  of  author  identification  of  anonymous  texts  (taken 
from  Bacon,  Marlowe  and  Shakespeare)  [1],  now  has  been 
grown  for  forensic  analysis,  electronic  commerce  etc.  This 
extended  version  of  author  attribution  problem  has  been 
defined as needle-in-a-haystack problem in [2]  

When  an  author  writes 

they  use  certain  words 
unconsciously  and  we  should  able  to  find  some  underlying 
pattern  for  an  authors  style.  The  fundamental  assumption  of 
authorship  attribution  is  that  each  author  has  habit  of  using 
specific  words  that  make  their  writing  unique  Extraction  of 
features  from  text  that  distinguish  one  author  from  another 
includes  use  of  some  statistical  or  machine 
learning 
techniques.

STATISTICAL UNIVARIATE METHODS 

A)  Naive  Bayes  classifier:  In  this  Classifier  Learning  and 
classification  methods  based  on  probability  theory.  In 
Literature  it  is  found  that  Bayes  theorem  plays  a  critical 
role  in  probabilistic  learning  and  classification.  It  uses 
prior  probability  of  each  category  given  no  information 
about an item. 

B)  B.CUSUM  statistics  procedure:  In  stastical  analysis  the 
cusum called cumulative sum control chart, the CUSUM is 
a sequential Analysis technique used for  onitoring change 
detection.  As  its  name  implies,  CUSUM  involves  the 
calculation of a cumulative sum.  

C)  Cluster  Analysis:  Cluster  analysis  is  an  exploratory  data 
analysis  tool  for  solving  classification  problems.   Its 
purpose  is  to  sort  cases  (people,  things,  events,  etc)  into 
groups,  or  clusters,  so  that  the  degree  of  association  is 
strong  between  members  of  the  same  cluster  and  weak 
between members of different clusters.   

III.  MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES 

A.  Feed-forward neural network : 

A feed  forward  neural  network is  an artificial  neural 
network where  connections  between  the  units  do not form 
a directed  cycle.  This  is  different  from networks.  The  feed 
forward  neural  network  was  the  first  and  arguably  simplest 
type  of  artificial neural network  devised.  In this network,  the 
information  moves  in  only  one  direction,  forward,  from  the 
input  nodes,  through  the  hidden  nodes  (if  any)  and  to  the 
output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network. 
B.  Radial basis function network:  

A radial  basis  function  network is  an artificial  neural 
network that 
functions as activation 
basis 
functions. The output of the network is a linear combination of 
radial  basis  functions  of  the  inputs  and  neuron  parameters.

In machine 

learning, support  vector  machines (SVMs, 
also support  vector  networks  are supervised  learning models 
with  associated  learning algorithms that  analyze  data  and 
recognize  patterns,  used 
for classification and regression 
analysis. The basic SVM takes a set of input data and predicts, 
for each given input, which of two possible classes  forms the 
output, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.

potential authors from online communication. 

Step2:  Feature  Extraction:-After

Step3:  Model  Generation:-Dataset  should  be  divided  into 
training  and  testing  set.  Classification  techniques  should  be 
applied.  An  iterative  training  and  testing  process  may  be 
needed 

Step4:  Author  Identification:-Developed  model  can  be 

used to predict the authorship of unknown online messages

CONCLUSION 

The  complexity  level  of  aforementioned  problem  is 
determined  by  the  various  parameters  like  the  number  of 
authors and size of training set. This both the parameters play 
vital  role  to  determine  prediction  accuracy.  Although  these 
parameters  are  considered  critical  to  the  complexity  of  the 
problem  and  therefore  the  prediction  accuracy,  there  are  no 
studies examining their impact on the authorship-identification 
performance  in a  systematic  way.  The  problem  of  authorship 
attribution 
literature, 
newspapers  etc  but  limited  work  has  been  done  for  the 
authorship identification of online messages like blogs, emails 
and chat. This comparative study concluded that if number of 
author’s  increases  and  size  of  training  sets  decreases  then 
performance  degrades.  Thus,  by  considering  all 
these 
parameters  further research  direction  is  to  improve  prediction 
accuracy.
