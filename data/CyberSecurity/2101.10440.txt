Solution of Variational Problems

Axel Dreves & Joachim Gwinner & Nina Ovcharova ∗

January 27, 2021

Abstract

In this article we show the crucial role of elliptic regularity theory for the development
of eﬃcient numerical methods for the solution of some variational problems. Here we
focus to a class of elliptic multiobjective optimal control problems that can be formulated
as jointly convex generalized Nash equilibrium problems (GNEPs) and to nonsmooth
boundary value problems that stem from contact mechanics leading to elliptic variational
inequalities (VIs).

Keywords: complementarity problem, dual mixed formulation, elliptic boundary value prob-
lem, jointly convex generalized Nash equilibrium problem, Lagrange multiplier, multiobjective
optimal control, normalized Nash equilibrium, obstacle problem, saddle point formulation,
Signorini problem, smooth domain, unilateral contact, variational inequality.

Introduction

As noted in the survey paper [44], elliptic regularity theory is of essential importance for the
derivation of error estimates of the ﬁnite element method (FEM) for the numerical solution
of nonsmooth boundary value problems formulated as variational inequalities. This is now
well documented in the literature starting from the pioneering work of Falk [18]. More recent
examples of this research direction are the paper [39] on the h-FEM treatment of unilateral
crack problems and other nonsmooth constraints and the paper [25] on hp-FEM convergence
for unilateral contact problems with Tresca friction in plane linear elastostatics.
This article is concerned with other applications of elliptic regularity theory. First we con-
sider a class of elliptic multiobjective optimal control problems formulated as jointly convex
generalized Nash equilibrium problems. As will be detailed below, a rather straightforward
variational formulation of such a problem leads to a generalized Nash equilibrium problem
(GNEP), where however each player has to satisfy diﬀerent constraints that depend on the
control of the other players. Thus one obtains more involved quasi-variational inequalities,
in contrast to variational inequalities that can be obtained when considering normalized so-
lutions of jointly convex GNEPs as is shown in the recent paper [17], based on regularity of
the underlying elliptic boundary value problem.

Then we turn to Signorini mixed boundary value problems, unilateral frictionless contact prob-
lems and other nonsmooth boundary value problems that can be formulated as variational
inequalities with a coercive bilinear form. To get rid of relatively complicated constraints as
e.g., inequality constraints and to obtain simpler nonnegativity constraints or box constraints
one can introduce Lagrange multipliers similar as in constrained optimization in ﬁnite dimen-
sions. In addition to simpliﬁcation for better numerical treatment, there is also an intrinsic
interest in Lagrange multipliers as dual variables. Often in applications they have a clear
physical meaning and are more of interest than the primal variables; speaking in the language
of continuum mechanics, the engineer is often more interested in the stresses and strains than
in the displacements. This motivates multiﬁeld variational formulations and multiple saddle
point problem formulations, see [19, 26, 27]. While for linear elliptic boundary value problems
the passage from the primal variational formulation to a dual mixed formulation or a saddle
point problem form involving a Lagrange multiplier is a standard procedure and while there
are the well-established mixed ﬁnite element methods [11, 4] for their numerical treatment,
such a procedure for non-smoothly constrained problems has to overcome several diﬃculties.
First, the standard approach to existence of Lagrange multipliers for inequality constrained
optimization in inﬁnite dimensional spaces relies on the Hahn-Banach separation theorem and
needs an interior point condition (Slater condition) with respect to the ordering cone in the
image space. However, the topological interior of such an ordering cone in standard function
(Hilbert or Banach) spaces, as e.g. the interior of the cone Lp
+ of non-negative Lp functions is
empty. So one may resort to the nonempty quasi relative interior of Lp
+ and one may impose
a Slater-like condition, that is, the existence of a feasible point that lies in the quasi relative
interior of Lp
+. However, as a counterexample of Daniele and Giuﬀr`e [13] shows, this condi-
tion is not suﬃcient, and extra more complicated assumptions or related involved conditions
that are actually equivalent are needed to ensure the existence of a Lagrange multiplier, see
[9, 13, 14, 15].
Therefore we proceed in another way and show how by a simple formula one obtains a
Lagrange multiplier in the dual of the preimage space thus even reducing the variational
inequality to a complementarity problem. By this simple approach, the Lagrange multiplier
lives in the dual of the Sobolev space of the variational problem, thus at ﬁrst, is a general
measure which may be singular. Here regularity theory comes into play to conclude that
the Lagrange multiplier is indeed an Lp function. Thus from an inequality constraint, one
ﬁnally obtains a Lagrange multiplier in the cone Lp
+ of non-negative Lp functions. This
approach works also with not necessarily symmetric bilinear forms, when the equivalence to
convex quadratic optimization is lost; it even works for nonlinear operators. Moreover, we can
combine such dual mixed formulations for variational problems with inequality constraints
via non-negative Lagrange multipliers with mixed formulations for variational inequalities of
second kind where the Lagrange multiplier is in a simple box set. This applies to unilateral
contact problems with Tresca friction.
The outline of this article is as follows. The next section provides a review of elliptic regularity
theory dealing with the linear Dirichlet problem, the scalar unilateral boundary value problem
(obstacle problem), and frictionless unilateral contact contact of linear elastostatics. In section
3 we consider a class of elliptic multiobjective optimal control problems and show following
[17] how based on elliptic regularity theory, these problems can be reformulated as so-called
jointly convex generalized Nash equilibria.
In section 4 we present a direct approach to
mixed formulations of some nonsmooth variational problems and of associated variational
inequalities. The article ends with some conclusions and an outlook to some open problems.

2 A Review of Elliptic Regularity Theory

In this section we review the elliptic regularity theory that is needed for the understanding
of the subsequent sections.

2.1 Regularity of linear scalar Dirichlet problem

In this subsection we are concerned with the regularity of the solution of the Dirichlet problem
with a (scalar) linear second-order elliptic operator L; that is, the operator L is of the form
(summation convention employed)

Lu = Di(−aij(x) Dju) + a(x)u ,
where the coeﬃcients aij (i, j = 1, . . . , d) and a are assumed to be bounded, measurable
functions on a domain Ω ⊂ Rd and moreover, a is non-negative and there exists a positive
number α such that

aij(x) ξiξj ≥ α|ξ|2 , ∀x ∈ Ω, ξ ∈ Rd .
A simple example is L = −∆, the negative Laplacian on Rd; on the other hand, lower order
terms involving Diu can easily be included in the deﬁnition of L. The operator L above gives
rise to the bilinear form

L(u, v) =

[aij(x)DjuDiv + a(x)uv] dx .

Let in addition f be (locally) integrable on Ω and ϕ belong to H 1(Ω), the Sobolev space of
all L2 functions on Ω with weak L2 derivatives, see [1]. Then a function u ∈ H 1(Ω) is called
a weak solution of the Dirichlet problem:

ZΩ

if u − ϕ ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) and u satisﬁes

Lu = f,

u = ϕ on ∂Ω,

L(u, v) =

ZΩ

f v dx, ∀v ∈ C 1

0 (Ω) .

The following example of a domain with a reentrant corner taken from the book of Braess [10]
shows that even for smooth data f, ϕ we cannot expect the solution to be in H 2(Ω), not to
mention in C 2(Ω), what is suggested by a classic treatment of partial diﬀerential equations.

Example 2.1 Let

Ω = {x = (x1, x2) ∈ R2 :
Identify R2 with C. Let z = x1 + ix2 = ρ exp(iθ) and consider

|x| < 1, x1 < 0 or x2 > 0} .

w(z) = z2/3;

u(x) = Im w(z) = ρ2/3 sin

Since w′(z) = 2

3 , even the ﬁrst derivatives of u are not bounded for z → 0.

There are two options for a domain to obtain regularity u ∈ H 2(Ω): smoothness of the
boundary ∂Ω or convexity of the domain. For the ﬁrst let us recall from the monograph of
Gilbarg and Trudinger [20, Theorem 8.12]

Theorem 2.2 Suppose that ∂Ω is of class C 2. Moreover assume the coeﬃcients aij are
uniformly Lipschitz continuous in Ω and for the data assume f ∈ L2(Ω) and ϕ ∈ H 2(Ω)
such that u − ϕ ∈ H 1
0 (Ω) with a weak solution u of the above Dirichlet problem. Then also
u ∈ H 2(Ω).

For such a regularity result and for its direct proof we can also refer to the monograph of
Aubin [3, chapter 7, section 1-8, Theorem 1-1] and to the monograph of Kinderlehrer and
Stampacchia [38, chapter IV, appendix A].
Regularity results for the Dirichlet problem for elliptic operators, respectively for the Lapla-
cian on convex domains and on more general so-called semiconvex domains (here a bounded
if for any x ∈ ∂Ω there exists an open ball Bx ⊂ Rd \ ¯Ω with
domain is semiconvex,
¯Bx ∩ ¯Ω = {x}) are established in the work of Kadlec [35] and of Mitrea et al. [42]. Let
us also mention the regularity results for solutions of the equations of linear elasticity in
convex plane polygonal domains by Bacuta and Bramble [5].

2.2 Regularity of the scalar unilateral boundary value problem

Let us turn to the regularity of scalar unilateral boundary value problems, in particular of
Signorini boundary value problems. We are also concerned with the regularity of domain
obstacle problems, since domain obstacle and boundary obstacle (Signorini) problems are
related as follows.
Let ΓD, ΓS be two disjoint smooth and open subset of ∂Ω such that ∂Ω = ¯ΓD ∪ ¯ΓS. Let A be
a linear elliptic operator deﬁned by Au = −Dj(aijDiu) with coeﬃcients aij as above giving
the bilinear form

a(u, v) =

aij(x) Diu(x) Djv(x) dx .

Let ψ ∈ H 1(Ω) with ψ ≤ 0 on ΓS, let ˜ψ be the unique solution of the Dirichlet problem

ZΩ

∆ ˜ψ = f in Ω,

˜ψ = ψ on ∂Ω

and assume that ˜ψ ∈ H 2(Ω). Let

V = {v ∈ H 1(Ω) : v = 0 on ΓD}

and deﬁne the closed convex subsets of V :

K = {v ∈ V : v ≥ ψ on ΓS},
˜K = {v ∈ V : v ≥ ˜ψ in Ω, v = ψ on ΓS} .

Then there holds the following

Theorem 2.3 If u is the solution of the VI (domain obstacle problem)

u ∈ ˜K,

a(u, v − u) ≥

f (v − u) dx ∀v ∈ ˜K,

ZΩ

4

then u resolves the VI (Signorini problem)

u ∈ K,

a(u, v − u) ≥

f (v − u) dx ∀v ∈ K .

ZΩ

For its proof see the proof of Theorem 9.3 in [38, chapter IV].
In virtue of Theorem 2.3 we can conclude from the regularity result [38, chapter IV, Theorem
2.3] for the domain obstacle problem the following regularity result for the Signorini problem
with A = −∆:

Theorem 2.4 Suppose f ∈ Ls(Ω) and max(−∆ ˜ψ − f, 0) ∈ Ls(Ω) for some s > d. Then the
solution of the above Signorini problem with A = −∆ lies in H 2,s(Ω) ∩ C 1,λ( ¯Ω), λ = 1 − (d/s).
Hence ∆u ∈ Ls(Ω).

There is a reﬁnement concerning the regularity of the domain obstacle problem at the bound-
ary by Jensen [33]. He has proven the local regularity W 2,∞ of the solution at boundary
points. However, Kinderlehrer [37] has provided the following example of a scalar Signorini
problem with a solution that fails to be in H 2(Ω). Here even the boundary obstacle is zero,
but ∂ΓD ∩ ∂ΓS 6= ∅ with the Dirichlet part ΓD and the Signorini part ΓS.

Example 2.5 Let

Ω = {x = (x1, x2) ∈ R2 | |x| < 1, x2 > 0}

with the mutually disjoint, open boundary parts

ΓS = {x = (x1, 0) | − 1 < x1 < 0},
ΓN = {x = (x1, 0) | 0 < x1 < 1},
ΓD = {x = (x1, x2) | |x| = 1, x2 > 0} .

Let z = x1 + ix2 = ρ exp(iθ) and consider

u(x) = − Re z1/2 = −ρ1/2 cos(θ/2) .

So u is harmonic and u(x) = 0 for x1 < 0, x2 = 0. By the Cauchy-Riemann diﬀerential
equations,

∂
∂ν

u(x1, 0) = −

∂

u(x1, 0) = −

Im z1/2 =

if x1 > 0 ,

if x1 < 0 ,

x2 = 0 .

Hence u ∈ H 1(Ω) satisﬁes −∆u = 0 in Ω and the Neumann, respectively Dirichlet boundary
conditions

and the Signorini boundary conditions

Thus u solves the VI

2.3 Variational formulation of frictionless unilateral contact problem of

linear elastostatics

Before we continue our review of elliptic regularity theory addressing frictionless unilateral
contact problems we introduce some notation from continuum mechanics and describe the
variational form of unilateral contact problems as variational inequalities (of ﬁrst kind, fol-
lowing the terminology of [21]).
Let us assume Hooke’s law and small deformations of a non–homogeneous, anisotropic body.
For notational simplicity we focus to the case of plane elasticity; the three-dimensional case
poses no additional diﬃculty in deriving the variational formulation. So let Ω ⊂ R2 be a
bounded plane domain with Lipschitz boundary Γ (Γ ∈ C 0,1), occupied by an elastic body,
and let x = (x1, x2) be a Cartesian coordinate system. Then n = (n1, n2), the unit outward
normal to Γ, exists almost everywhere and n ∈ [L∞(Γ)]2, see e.g. [36, Theorem 5.4].
With the displacement vector v = (v1, v2) to lie in the Sobolev space [H 1(Ω)]2 the linearized
strains are given by

∂vj
∂xi (cid:19)
and Hooke’s law relating strains and stresses reads

εij(v) =

τij = Eijkl εkl

where we use the summation convention over a repeated index within the range 1, 2 and where
the elasticity coeﬃcients Eijkl ∈ L∞(Ω) satisfy

Eijkl = Eklij = Ejikl ;

∃c0 > 0 : Eijkl εij εkl ≥ c0 εij εij ∀ εij = εji .
(3)
With the given vector F = (F1, F2) ∈ [L2(Ω)]2 the stress ﬁeld has to satisfy the equilibrium
equations

The traction vector b on the boundary, where

can be decomposed into the normal component

bi = τij nj

bn = bi ni = τij ni ni

6

and the tangential component

bt = bi ti = τij ti nj ,

where t = (t1, t2) = (−n2, n1) is the unit tangential vector. Likewise the displacement v can
be decomposed (see [36, Chapter 5], [16] for the relevant trace theorems):

vn = vini , vt = viti .

To describe the boundary conditions, let Γ = ΓD ∪ ΓN ∪ ΓS, where the open parts ΓD, ΓN ,
and ΓS are mutually disjoint. Eventually nonzero displacements D ∈ [H1(ΓD)]2, respectively
tractions T ∈ [L2(ΓN )]2 are prescribed on ΓD, resp. ΓN , i.e.,

vi = Di
bi = Ti

on ΓD ,
on ΓN ,

(5)

(6)

whereas on ΓS the frictionless unilateral contact conditions (Signorini’s conditions for vn and
bn)

vn ≤ g, bn ≤ 0, (vn − g) bn = 0, bt = 0

(7)

with a given gap function g ∈ L2(ΓS) are imposed. To make the contact problem meaningful
we assume meas(ΓS) > 0. Here we also require meas(ΓD) > 0, hence rigid body motions are
excluded and the variational problem becomes coercive.
Now the problem (1), (2), (4) - (7) can be formulated as the following variational inequality
(VI): Find u ∈ K such that

β(u, v − u) ≥ λ(v − u) ∀v ∈ K .

(8)

where we introduce the bilinear form, respectively the linear form

β(v, w) =

Eijkl εij(v) εkl(w) dx ,

λ(v) =

on the function space

and the convex closed subset

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

K = {v ∈ V | vi = Di on ΓD; vn ≤ g on ΓS} .

One may reduce the inhomogeneous inequality constraint vn = vini ≤ g to the homogeneous
inequality constraint ˜vn = ˜vini ≤ 0, thus simplify to a convex cone constraint by subtraction
of some appropriate extension g of g ∈ L2(ΓS) to [H 1(Ω)]2. However, this simple reduction
for unilateral constraints does not work with more general bilateral constraints of the form
ga ≤ vn = vini ≤ gb, when the extended real-valued boundary obstacles have domains that
intersect, i.e., dom ga ∩ dom gb 6= ∅, in particular in a three-dimensional situation.

2.4 Regularity of frictionless unilateral contact problem of linear elasto-

statics

In view of his example given above Kinderlehrer [37] could prove by a diﬀerence quotient
technique that the solution u of the Signorini problem is in H 2 except perhaps near points
of ∂ΓS ∪ ∂ΓN ∪ ∂ΓD ⊂ Ω, more precisely the following result for the d−dimensional mixed
Signorini boundary value problem in the case g = 0, what is by the remark above, no loss of
generality concerning regularity.

Theorem 2.6 [37, Theorem 2.2] Suppose for the data F ∈ [L2(Ω)]d, T ∈ [H 1(ΓD)]d, D ∈
[H 2(ΓD)]d. Set Ωδ = {x ∈ Ω | dist (x, ∂ΓS ∪ ∂ΓN ∪ ∂ΓD) > δ} for δ > 0. Then for each δ > 0
there hold u ∈ (H 2(Ωδ))d and the Signorini conditions (7) pointwise a.e. on ΓS.

Sobolev imbedding of H 2 in spaces of H¨older continuous functions implies the

Corollary 2.7 Under the assumptions of the data as in the above theorem, there holds

for

and for

d = 2, u ∈ [C 0,α( ¯Ωδ)]2 for some 0 < α < 1 ,
d = 3, u ∈ [C 0,

2 ( ¯Ωδ)]2 .

1

By the theory of pseudodiﬀerential operators Schumann [47], extended the latter result to
[C 1,α(Ω ∪ Γ)]2 regularity of the solution u; the precise value of α is not known. To conclude
this section, we refer to the survey [48] of schumann who gives an excellent overview of the
mathematical methods to prove regularity results for variational inequalities and unilateral
problems in elasticity.

3 From elliptic multiobjective optimal control to jointly con-

vex generalized Nash equilibria

In this section we consider a class of elliptic multiobjective optimal control problems and show
following [17] how based on elliptic regularity theory, these problems can be reformulated as
so-called jointly convex generalized Nash equilibria.

The concept of jointly convex generalized Nash equilibrium problems

Let Vν, ν = 1, . . . , N be real separable Hilbert spaces or more general reﬂexive, separable
Banach spaces endowed with norms k · kν , and deﬁne V := V1 × . . . × VN . Further, let X
be a nonempty, closed, and convex subset of V and assume that the objective functions
θν : V1 × . . . × VN → R, θν(·, x−ν ) : Vν → R are convex for any ﬁxed x−ν, where we use
the notation x = (x1, . . . , xN ) = (xν, x−ν ) to emphasize the role of the variable xν, but this
notation does not mean a permutation. In this setting the inﬁnite dimensional jointly convex
generalized Nash equilibrium (GNEP for short) has the following form

xν θν(xν, x−ν)
min

subject to (s.t.)

(xν , x−ν) ∈ X

(9)

for all ν = 1, . . . , N. The reason for calling this problem jointly convex is that the strategies
must belong to a common convex set X, instead of each player having his own strategy set

8

Xν(x−ν ) depending on the rivals’ strategy x−ν. We call ¯x a generalized Nash equilibrium, if
¯x ∈ X satisﬁes

θν(¯xν , ¯x−ν) ≤ θν(xν, ¯x−ν) ,

∀(xν, ¯x−ν ) ∈ X

for all ν = 1, . . . , N. Note that the concept of GNEPs goes back to the 1954 paper [2] of
Arrow and Debreu.
Next let us introduce the Nikaido-Isoda function

Ψ(x, y) :=

N

ν=1
X

(cid:2)

θν(xν, x−ν ) − θν(yν, x−ν )

,

(cid:3)

see the 1955 paper [43] of Nikaido and Isoda, to deﬁne normalized solutions of a jointly convex
GNEP: ¯x ∈ X is called a normalized Nash equilibrium, or a normalized solution of the jointly
convex GNEP if

Ψ(¯x, y) ≤ 0 ,

∀y ∈ X .

Thus we get a characterization of some solutions, namely the normalized solutions of jointly
convex GNEPs via a variational inequality in contrast to more involved quasi-variational
inequalities that characterize the solutions of GNEPs in general form, not necessarily jointly
convex. Therefore, computing normalized solutions of jointly-convex GNEPs is typically
much easier than obtaining solutions of GNEPs in general form. Since for a normalized Nash
equilibrium ¯x we have for all ν = 1, . . . , N and all (yν , ¯x−ν) ∈ X

θν(¯xν , ¯x−ν) − θν(yν, ¯x−ν) = Ψ(¯x, (yν , ¯x−ν)) ≤ sup
y∈X

Ψ(¯x, y) ≤ 0,

every normalized solution is also a generalized Nash equilibrium, i.e., for all ν = 1, . . . , N it
holds that

θν(¯xν , ¯x−ν) ≤ θν(yν, ¯x−ν )

∀(yν, ¯x−ν) ∈ X ;

however, the converse is not true.

Primal formulation of elliptic multiobjective optimal control problems

Let Ω ⊂ Rd (d = 2, 3) be a bounded Lipschitz domain and let V := H 1
0 (Ω) denote the
Sobolev space of all L2 functions on Ω with weak L2 derivatives and zero boundary values.
Let U ν := L2(Ω) be the space for the controls uν for all ν = 1, . . . , N. We have the weights
γν > 0, βν > 0, the given data f, gν ∈ L2(Ω), (ν = 1, . . . , N ); aν , bν ∈ R with aν ≤ bν
(ν = 1, . . . , N ), a0, b0 ∈ H 1(Ω) with a0(x) < b0(x) and some continuous, compact, and linear
operators χν : V → L2(Ω) (ν = 1, . . . , N ). Then we consider the following problem

for all ν = 1, . . . , N. In this problem every player ν minimizes his own cost function through
his individual control variable uν and the common state variable y. The state is determined

9

by the controls of all players via a partial diﬀerential equation (pde) given by a linear elliptic
partial diﬀerential operator L of second order as introduced in the previous section.
To provide a functional analytic meaning we can write the above pde constraint in variational
form as

0 (Ω) in L2(Ω), the state constraints a0 ≤ y ≤ b0 are
Using the continuous embedding from H 1
to be understood in the L2 sense as the control constraints aν ≤ uν ≤ bν, which imply that
the controls are actually L∞ functions, since aν, bν ∈ R.
The elliptic multiobjective optimal control problem (I) is, however, not a GNEP, since the
state y is a common optimization variable for all players.
If we introduce diﬀerent state
variables yν for each player ν ∈ {1, . . . , N }, and if we could guarantee that all the states
are equal, we get a GNEP. But we do not get a jointly convex GNEP, since the players
N
then have diﬀerent constraints L yν =
µ=1 βµuµ + f, depending on the controls of the other
players. For the numerical solution of these GNEPs in general form one can use its’ optimality
conditions that are equivalent to quasi-variational inequalities, and are much harder to solve
than VIs. Also the number of algorithms for the solution of quasi-variational inequalities is
rather limited. Therefore our next aim is to develop a jointly convex reformulation.

in [30] as a GNEP and using a penalty approach and a strict uniform feasible response
assumption, the existence of a solution was shown. Further, using the Nikaido-Isoda function,
this reformulation (II) was used in [31] to show existence of a Nash equilibrium for the
equivalent problem (I). Moreover it was shown that one can solve these reformulations (II)
(even for parabolic and not only elliptic pdes) via a primal-dual path-following method based
on the Nikaiod-Isoda function.
Let us stress that (II) is already a jointly convex GNEP. However, every evaluation of
S(uν , u−ν) requires the solution of the pde. To avoid this we give a third equivalent for-
mulation to (I).

4 Lagrange multipliers, convex duality theory, and mixed for-

mulations of nonsmooth variational problems

In this section we provide mixed formulations of some nonsmooth variational problems and
of associated variational inequalities. To achieve this goal we pursue a direct relatively simple
approach to Lagrange multipliers that, however, heavily hinges on elliptic regularity theory.
To put this approach in perspective we ﬁrst shortly review the standard approach to Lagrange
multipliers in convex duality theory that is based on the Hahn-Banach separation theorem.

A short review of convex inﬁnite dimensional duality theory in function
spaces

The standard approach to prove existence of Lagrange multipliers for inequality constrained
optimization problems in inﬁnite dimensional spaces is based on the Hahn-Banach separation
theorem and thus needs interior point conditions, in particular a nonvoid interior of the or-
dering cone associated to the inequality constraint. In function spaces of continuous functions
endowed with the maximum norm with applications, e.g., to Chebychev approximation one
can work with the topological interior of the ordering cone, see e.g., [32]. However, the cone
of non-negative Lp functions and hence the ordering cone in the Sobolev spaces - relevant for
pde constrained optimization - have empty topological interior. To overcome this diﬃculty
one can resort to the concept of the so-called quasi-relative interior of a convex set introduced
by Borwein and Lewis [8]. Therefore next we give the deﬁnition of this concept and a short
review of corresponding recent results on Lagrangean duality.
Let C be a nonvoid subset of a real normed space X. Let cl C, co C, cone C denote the
topological closure, convex hull, conical hull of C, respectively. Then for a given point x ∈ C,
the set

TC (x) = {y ∈ X : y = lim
n→∞

tn(xn − x), tn > 0, xn ∈ C (∀n ∈ N), lim
n→∞

xn = x}

is called the tangent cone (contingent cone) to C at x. If C is convex, then TC(x) = cl cone(C−
x). With the dual space X ∗ and the duality form (., .), the normal cone to C at x ∈ C is
deﬁned by

NC(x) = {x∗ ∈ X ∗ : (x∗, y − x) ≤ 0, ∀y ∈ C} .

Now the quasi-interior of a convex subset C of X is the set

and there holds the characterization, see [14], for x in the convex set C:

qi C = {x ∈ C : cl cone (C − x) = X}

x ∈ qi C ⇔ NC(x) = {0X ∗ } .

Due to Borwein and Lewis [8] is the following reﬁnement of the notion of the quasi-interior:
The quasirelative interior of a convex subset C of X is the set

qri C = {x ∈ C : cl cone (C − x) is a linear subspace of X}

and there holds the characterization, see [14], for x in the convex set C:
T x ∈ qri C ⇔ NC(x) is a linear subspace of X ∗ .
These are useful concepts in Lp function spaces and thus in Sobolev spaces as shown by the
following example.

12

Example 4.1 Consider the Banach space X = L2(T, µ) with 1 ≤ p < ∞ on a measure space
(T, µ) and the closed convex cone C = {z ∈ X : z(t) ≥ 0 µ - a.e. }. Then the characteristic
function of T , 1 = 1T lies in qi C, hence in qri C. Indeed, by Lebesgue’s theorem of majorized
convergence, any x ∈ X can be approximated by the sequence {xn} of truncations,

xn(t) =

(cid:26)

x(t)
−n

if x(t) ≥ −n a.e.;
elsewhere,

and clearly xn ∈ n(C − 1).

Now let us turn to inequality constrained convex optimization and Lagrangean duality theory.
Consider the following primal optimization problem:

where

(P)

f (x) ,

inf
x∈R

R = {x ∈ S : g(x) ∈ −C},

is assumed to be nonempty and S a nonempty subset of X; Y is another normed space
partially ordered by a convex cone C; f : S → R and g : S → Y are two maps such that
the map (f, g) : S → R × Y , deﬁned by (f, g)(x) = (f (x), g(x)), ∀x ∈ S is convex-like with
respect to the cone R+ × C ⊂ R × Y , that is the set (f, g)S + R+ × C is convex. Then the
Lagrangian is

and the Lagrange dual problem to (P) reads

L(x, ℓ) = f (x) + (ℓ, g(x)),

x ∈ S, ℓ ∈ C ∗

(D)

sup
ℓ∈C∗

inf
x∈S

[f (x) + (ℓ, g(x))] ,

where C ∗ = {x∗ ∈ X ∗ : (x∗, x) ≥ 0, ∀x ∈ C} is the dual cone to C. While for the optimal
values of (P) and (D), inf (P) = infx supℓ L(x, ℓ) ≥ supℓ inf x L(x, ℓ) = sup (D) trivially holds,
one is interested in the equality of these optimal values and moreover in the existence of a
Lagrange multiplier, that is, an optimal solution ℓ in (D). This is called strong duality.
In the favorable situation when the topological interior of the ordering cone, int C, is not
empty, the approach to strong duality in inﬁnite dimensions via the Hahn-Banach separation
theorem requires the easily veriﬁable Slater condition as a constraint qualiﬁcation (see the
important paper of Jeyakumar and Wolkowicz [34]), that is, the existence of a feasible point
˜x ∈ R such that g(˜x) ∈ −int C.
Thus one may be inclined to transfer this approach to the situation when the topological
interior of C is empty by replacing “int” by “qri”. However, this fails, as the following
example due to Daniele and Giuﬀr`e [13] shows.

Example 4.2 Let X = S = Y = l2, the Hilbert space of all real sequences x = (xn)n∈N with

However, ℓ with ℓn = 2n

n does not belong to l2. hence sup (D) = −∞ and the optimal values

This example can also be given in a function space using the well-known isometry of l2 and
L2(0, 2π) based on Fourier expansion.
So in addition to a qri Slater-like condition one needs extra conditions to ensure strong duality.
To this aim Bot¸, Csetnek, and Moldovan [9] introduce the following conic extension of (P) in
the image space:

Einf (P) = {(inf (P) − f (x) − r, −g(x) − y) : x ∈ S, r ≥ 0, y ∈ C}

= (inf (P), 0Y ) − (f, g) S − R+ × C ,

where as in classic convex duality theory only inf (P) ∈ R is required, but not the existence
of an optimal solution to (P). Note that by feasibility of (P), R 6= ∅ implies inf (P) < ∞ and
in the case inf (P) = −∞ strong duality trivially holds.
In this way Bot¸, Csetnek, and Moldovan [9] could prove the following strong duality result.

Theorem 4.3 [9, Theorem 4.1] Suppose that cl(C − C) = Y and there exists some ˜x ∈ S
such that g(˜x) ∈ −qri C. If

(0, 0Y ) /∈ qri co [Einf (P) ∪ {(0, 0Y )}] ,

(12)

then strong duality holds.

A direct approach to Lagrange multipliers and dual mixed formulations of
inequality constrained optimization and of VIs of the ﬁrst kind

We start with convex quadratic optimization in inﬁnite dimensional spaces. Let V be a real
Hilbert space and let Q be another real Hilbert space (for simplicity identiﬁed with its dual
Q′). Let A ∈ L(V, V ′) with A = A′, A ≥ 0 (i.e., hAv, vi ≥ 0, ∀v ∈ V ). Further let B ∈ L(V, Q)
and let f ∈ V ′, g ∈ Q be ﬁxed elements. Moreover let an order ≤ deﬁned in Q via a convex
closed cone C ⊂ Q via q ≥ 0, iﬀ q ∈ C. With these data consider the convex quadratic
optimization problem

14

(CQP )

(cid:26)

minimize f (v) = 1
subject to Bv ≤ g .

2 hAv, vi − hf, vi

This gives rise to the bilinear form a(u, v) := hAu, vi and the convex closed set

which is translated from the cone

K(g) := {v ∈ V | Bv ≤ g} ,

K0 := {v ∈ V | Bv ≤ 0}.

As is well-known, a solution u of (CQP ) is characterized by the following VI of the ﬁrst kind
- following the terminology in [21]:

(V I − 1)

u ∈ K(g), a(u, v − u) ≥ hf, v − ui, ∀v ∈ K(g) .

Here we present a simple approach - diﬀerent from the approach reviewed above - to Lagrange
multipliers. Assume that there exists a preimage of g under B, B˜g = g. This allows to work
with the duality on V × V ′, obtain readily the existence of a Lagrange multiplier in the dual
cone

K +

0 = {κ ∈ V ′

: hκ, wi ≥ 0, ∀w ∈ K0}

and arrive at the following characterization.

Proposition 4.4 Let u ∈ K(g). Then u solves the above (V I − 1), iﬀ there exists λ ∈ K +
0
such that (u, λ) ∈ V × V ′ solves the mixed system

(M P − 1)

a(u, v) = hλ, vi + hf, vi
hµ − λ, u − ˜gi ≥ 0 ,

(

for all v ∈ V, µ ∈ K +

0 . Further there holds the complementarity condition

hλ, u − ˜gi = 0 .

Proof. Let u ∈ K(g) solve the (V I − 1): a(u, v − u) ≥ hf, v − ui, ∀v ∈ K(g)
Deﬁne λ ∈ V ′ by λ(v) = a(u, v) − f (v). Then (M P − 1)1 holds. Further, for any v ∈ K0,
˜v := v + u lies in K(g) and hence

Thus λ ∈ K +

0 . Since ˜g ∈ K(g), u − ˜g ∈ K0,

λ(v) = a(u, ˜v − u) − f (˜v − u) ≥ 0 .

hµ − λ, u − ˜gi = hµ, u − ˜gi − [a(u, u − ˜g) − f (u − ˜g)] ≥ 0

0 and therefore (M P − 1) holds.

for any µ ∈ K +
The complementarity condition follows from (M P − 1)2 by the choices µ = 2λ, µ = 0.
Vice versa, let v ∈ K(g), hence v − ˜g ∈ K0. This implies by the complementarity condition

hλ, v − ui = hλ, v − ˜gi − hλ, u − ˜gi ≥ 0 .

Hence we arrive at

a(u, v − u) = (f + λ)(v − u) ≥ f (v − u) .

15

(cid:3)

By the proof above it is clear that (M P − 1) is equivalent to the following complementarity
problem: Find (u, λ) ∈ V × V ′ such that

(CP − 1)

λ = Au − f
λ ∈ K +
hλ, u − ˜gi = 0 .

0 , u − ˜g ∈ K0






Moreover the proof shows that the characterization above holds also with not necessarily
symmetric bilinear forms, when the equivalence to convex quadratic optimization is lost; it
even holds for nonlinear operators A mapping a Banach space V to its dual V ′.
This approach applies to domain obstacle problems, where the linear map B is the imbedding
map [1], say from H 1(Ω) to L2(Ω) for linear scalar elliptic operators L or more generally
from W m,p(Ω) to some Lq(Ω). It also applies to boundary obstacle problems or unilateral
contact problems with the Signorini condition on some boundary part Γc in appropriate
function spaces, where the linear map B is the trace map γ [16] to the boundary part Γc. By
this simple approach, the Lagrange multiplier lives in the dual of the Sobolev space of the
variational problem, thus at ﬁrst, is a general measure which may be singular. Here regularity
theory - see the review in the second section of this paper - comes into play to conclude that
the Lagrange multiplier is indeed a Lp function. Thus from an inequality constraint, one
ﬁnally obtains a Lagrange multiplier λ in the cone Lp
+ of non-negative Lp functions on the
domain Ω. Thus we obtain the recent result [15, Theorem 3.3] of Daniele, Giuﬀr`e, Maugeri,
and Raciti. When in the (scalar) mixed Signorini problem with a linear elliptic pde, there
exists a multiplier ℓ to the inequality constraint γv ≤ g ⇔ v|Γc ≤ g a.e. that lives in the
dual Q′ to the image space Q = L2(Γc), thus lies in L2
+(Γc), then the multipliers ℓ and λ are
related by λ = γ∗ℓ, where γ∗ denotes the adjoint of the trace map γ : H 1(Ω) → L2(Γc)
Indeed, this direct simple approach to Lagrange multipliers and mixed formulations is used in
an eﬃcient numerical treatment of domain obstacle problems. Based on such mixed formu-
lations the very eﬀective biorthogonal basis functions with local support, due to Lamichhane
and Wohlmuth [41], can be employed for approximation of the Lagrange multipliers in the
hp-adaptive FEM for elliptic obstacle problems, see the recent paper [6] of Banz and Schr¨oder.

hAv, vi − hf, vi + ϕ(v),

where ϕ is convex, even positively homogeneous on V , but not diﬀerentiable in the clas-
sic sense. A prominent example encountered with given friction or Tresca friction in solid
mechanics is

ϕg(v) =

g|v| ds

(g ∈ L∞(Γc), g > 0) .

An optimal solution of (N OP ) is characterized as a solution of the VI of the second kind:

To reveal the duality structure, introduce

M (g) = {µ ∈ L2(Γ), |µ| ≤ g a.e. } .

Although, with g ∈ L∞(Γ), this set is clearly contained in L∞(Γ), we stick to the easier
treatable L2 duality. Thus (V I − 2) is equivalent - as it is shown in more general terms in
Proposition 4.5 below - to the mixed problem:
Find u ∈ V = H 1(Ω), λ ∈ M (g) such that for all v ∈ V, µ ∈ M (g)

hAu, viV ∗×V + hλ, viL2(Γ) = hf, viV ∗×V ,

(

Indeed, in the more general setting of a reﬂexive Banach space V , a map A : V → V ∗, f ∈ V ∗
and a sublinear functional ϕ : V → R, we have the following result using the convex weakly-
∗-compact subdiﬀerential

P := ∂ϕ(0) = {q ∈ V ∗, hq, vi ≤ ϕ(v), ∀v ∈ V } .

Proposition 4.5 u ∈ V solves the above (V I − 2), iﬀ there exists p ∈ P such that (u, p) ∈
V × V ∗ solves the mixed system

(M P − 2)

hAu, vi + hp, vi = hf, vi
hp − q, ui ≥ 0 ,

(

for all v ∈ V, q ∈ P .

Proof. Let u ∈ V solve (V I − 2). Then the choice v = 0 gives

hAu, ui + ϕ(u) ≤ f (u) ,

(13)

17

whereas the choice v = tw, w ∈ V, t > 0, t → ∞ gives for all w ∈ V ,

hence from (13) and (14) we get

hAu, wi + ϕ(w) ≥ f (w) ,

hAu, ui + ϕ(u) = f (u) .

(14)

(15)

Note that (15) and (14) imply (V I − 2), hence these assertions are equivalent to (V I − 2).
Deﬁne p ∈ V ∗ by p = f − Au. Then (M P − 2)1 trivially holds. Further from (14), for any
w ∈ V , ϕ(v) ≥ hp, wi, hence p lies in ∂ϕ(0) = P . Finally from (15), ϕ(u) = hp, ui, hence
(M P − 2)2 follows.
Vice versa, (M P − 2)2 implies ϕ(u) = hp, ui, hence together with (M P − 2)1 and the choice
(cid:3)
v = u gives (15). Since ϕ(v) ≥ hp, vi, from (M P − 2)1 we arrive at (14).

Similarly as discussed in the previous subsection, the regularity of the multiplier p hinges
on the regularity of the datum f and in particular on the regularity of the solution u of the
(V I − 2) via the map A.
To apply the above general result to the friction-type functional ϕg we only have to set
V = H 1(Ω), ϕ = ϕg ◦ γ with the linear continuous trace operator γ that maps H 1(Ω) onto
H

2 (Γ) dense in L2(Γ) and use the subdiﬀerential chain rule [46]

1

∂ϕ = ∂(ϕg ◦ γ) = γ∗∂ϕgγ .

Note that this chain rule holds as an equality, since ϕg is real-valued and so the constraint
qualiﬁcation 0 ∈ int (range γ − dom ϕ) is trivially satisﬁed.
To conclude this subsection let us mention other duality relations and mixed formulations
useful in numerical treatment of variational inequalities of the second kind. By (L1, L∞)
duality and density one obtains

ϕg(v) =

g|v| ds = sup

g v µ ds

µ ∈ C(Γ), |µ| ≤ 1

.

(cid:26)ZΓc

(cid:27)

This is used in convergence proof of Finite Element Methods and Boundary Element Methods,
see [24, 25].
Another way to cope with the nondiﬀerentiable functional ϕg is to decompose the modulus
function |ρ| = ρ+ + ρ− with the positive part ρ+ = max(ρ, 0) ≥ 0 and the negative part
ρ− = max(−ρ, 0) ≥ 0. This leads to inequality constrained problems considered in the
previous subsection what is not elaborated here further.

A direct approach to Lagrange multipliers for more general VIs

To conclude this section we deal with the more general

(V I − 3)

u ∈ K,

hA(u), v − ui + ϕ(v) − ϕ(u) ≥ f (v − u), ∀v ∈ K ,

where as above f ∈ V ∗, ϕ : V → R is sublinear and now K ⊂ V is a convex closed cone
with vertex at zero. A VI of this form occurs in unilateral contact of a linear elastic body
with a rigid foundation under the Tresca friction law, if the initial gap between body and

18

foundation is zero, see [25]. The more general setting, in particular for non-zero gap, with K
and ϕ convex would encompass also the VIs of ﬁrst kind studied before, but needs additional
arguments. Therefore we prefer this simpler homogeneous setting to elucidate the direct
approach to Lagrange multipliers. In this setting we have the following result in a general
locally convex topological vector space V for a not necessarily linear operator A : V → V ∗.

Theorem 4.6 Let u ∈ K. Then u solves the above (V I −3), iﬀ there exist p ∈ P = ∂ϕ(0) and
λ ∈ K − such that the complementarity condition hλ, ui = 0 holds and (u, p, λ) ∈ V × V ∗ × V ∗
solves the mixed system

(M P − 3)

hA(u), vi + hp + λ, vi = hf, vi
hp − q, ui ≥ 0 ,

(

for all v ∈ V, q ∈ P .

Proof. Let u ∈ K solve (V I − 3). Then we ﬁrst proceed as in the proof of Proposition 4.5.
The choice v = 0 gives

whereas the choice v = tw, w ∈ K, t > 0, t → ∞ gives for all w ∈ K,

hA(u), ui + ϕ(u) ≤ f (u) ,

hence from (16) and (17) we get

hA(u), wi + ϕ(w) ≥ f (w) ,

hA(u), ui + ϕ(u) = f (u) .

(16)

(17)

(18)

Note that (18) and (17) imply (V I − 3), hence these assertions are equivalent to (V I − 3).
Deﬁne ℓ ∈ V ∗ by ℓ = f − A(u). From (17) we ﬁnd

ϕ(v) ≥ hℓ, wi ,

∀w ∈ K .

(19)

Now we claim that ℓ ∈ K − + P and that hence (M P − 3)1 holds. Note that both K − and P
are convex closed sets, moreover P is weakly* compact in V ∗. So the claim can be shown by
an indirect argument employing the separation theorem. Here we use that

ϕ(w) = max
q∈P

hq, wi

and thus (19) means that for any w ∈ K there exists q ∈ P such that hq, wi ≥ hℓ, wi.
Therefore by the extension lemma [23, Theorem 2.2] (which is a reﬁned version of the famous
Fan-Glicksberg-Hoﬀman theorem of alternative and is proved from a ﬁxed point theorem or
from the separation theorem) there exists p ∈ P such that hq, wi ≥ hℓ, wi holds for all w ∈ K.
Now deﬁne λ = ℓ − p, hence λ ∈ K − and ℓ = λ + p ∈ K − + P as claimed.
From (18) we obtain

hp, ui ≤ ϕ(u) = hλ + p, ui ,
hence hλ, ui ≥ 0. Since u ∈ K, λ ∈ K −, the complementarity condition hλ, ui = 0 follows.
This gives with (18) that ϕ(u) = hp, ui, hence we arrive at (M P − 3)2.
Vice versa, (M P − 3)1 implies together with the complementarity condition and (M P − 3)2

hf − A(u), ui = hλ + p, ui = hp, ui = ϕ(u) ,

19

hence (18). In view of λ ∈ K − we conclude from (M P − 3)1 that for any w ∈ K,

hf − A(u), wi = hλ + p, wi ≤ hp, wi ≤ ϕ(w) ,

hence (17).

5 Conclusions and outlook

We have seen the crucial role of elliptic regularity theory in two instances. First with elliptic
multiobjective optimal control formulated as jointly convex GNEP the regularity of the so-
lution of the underlying pde was needed to arrive at a reformulation that was the basis for
an eﬃcient numerical solution method. In this approach we had to require that the domain
where the elliptic pde lives is convex or suﬃciently smooth. On the other hand, real-world
domains may have reentrant corners or are only piecewise smooth. This leads to the question
how this approach can be reﬁned using the well-known elliptic theory in nonsmooth domains
[22], abandoning classic Sobolev spaces, and working instead with weighted Sobolev spaces
[40].
Then we have presented a direct approach to Lagrange multipliers in inequality constrained
and related nonsmooth boundary value problems which gives an immediate link between the
regularity of the Lagrange multiplier and the regularity of the solution of the problem. As al-
ready the one-dimensional obstacle problem demonstrates, there is a threshold of smoothness,
however, that in general cannot be overstepped even if the data are arbitrarily smooth. The
regularity theory for frictionless unilateral contact reported from the work [37] has shown the
inﬂuence of the switching points, where the boundary conditions change, on the smoothness
of the solution. So one may be interested in a more detailed analysis in weighted Sobolev
spaces [40] that takes the switching points in account.
Finally let us point out that we have here considered frictionless monotone unilateral contact
problems. Nonmonotone contact problems can be put in primal form as hemivariational
inequalities (HVIs). While the theory of HVIs is well developed, the numerical solution of
these problems is in its infancy; here we can refer to [49, 29, 7, 45, 12, 28] (ordered according
to publication date). So one may ask for mixed formulations with appropriate Lagrange
multipliers that would allow the development of mixed ﬁnite element procedures for the
eﬃcient solution of these nonconvex variational problems.
