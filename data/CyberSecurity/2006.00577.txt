Abstract—  Phishing  attacks  have  become  the  most  used 
technique  in  the  online  scams,  initiating  more  than  91%  of 
cyberattacks,  from  2012  onwards.    This  study  reviews  how 
Phishing  and  Spear  Phishing  attacks  are  carried  out  by  the 
phishers, through 5 steps which magnify the outcome, increasing 
the chance of success. 

presented: automated tools and decision-aid tools are the first 
two layers of defence.  

The remainder of this paper will point out how knowledge 
and training, which constitute the third layer of protection, are 
the most effective techniques not to be deceived by Phishing. 

The  focus  will  be  also  given  on  four  different  layers  of 
protection  against  these  social  engineering  attacks,  showing 
their  strengths  and  weaknesses;  the  first  and  second  layers 
consist of automated tools and decision-aid tools. The third one 
is users’ knowledge and expertise to deal with potential threats. 
The  last  layer,  defined  as  “external”,  will  underline  the 
importance  of  having  a  Multi-factors  authentication,  an 
effective  way  to  provide  enhanced  security,  creating  a  further 
layer of protection against Phishing and Spear Phishing.

INTRODUCTION  

Originally  invented  in  1989  to  connect  universities  and 
scientific  communities  around  the  globe  [1],  the  Internet  is 
now  a  popular  tool  for  entertainment,  to  run  activities, 
communicate with friends and deliver information. However, 
some  people  are  exploiting  their  anonymity  to  cheat  others; 
Phishing attacks are the most widely used technique [2]. 

Phishing has been defined as a “social engineering attack 
that uses e-mail, social network webpages, and other media to 
communicate messages intended to persuade potential victims 
to perform certain actions [e.g. entering login credentials in a 
cloned webpage, downloading an attachment embedded with 
a  malware  or  opening  an  infective  hyperlink]  or  divulge 
confidential  information  for  the  attacker’s  benefit  in  the 
context of cyber security” [3]. 

Phishing can lead to the exposure of intimate information, 
financial loss and a reduction in trust [4]. More than 91% of 
cyberattacks,  from  2012  onwards,  were  initiated  with  a 
Phishing attack and in 2018 almost one third of the total data 
breaches involved Phishing or Spear Phishing [5], which is a 
targeted Phishing attack, studied and applied to a specific user 
or set of users [6].  

This  paper  aims  to  investigate  how  Phishing  and  Spear 
Phishing attacks are performed, by analysing 5 different steps 
a Phisher carries out to hack the victim. Furthermore, different 
techniques  which  help  users  to  protect  against  them  will  be 

In conclusion, the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA),  a 
security  system  which certifies users’  identity  by  requesting 
multiple credentials will be suggested as possible further and 
“external” layer of defence. 

II. 

SPEAR PHISHING AND SOCIAL MEDIA 

Although  e-mail  remains  the  favourite  medium  for  the 
Spear Phishing attacks, social media has now opened the way 
to  new  attack  vectors  [7].    These  “social”  platforms  are  the 
most effective place for scammers to devise elaborate Spear 
Phishing campaigns, often against politicians and the military 
[8]; indeed, 25% of all Phishing attacks are against state actors 
and 70% of all state attacks are by Phishing [9].  

The  2016  U.S.  election  can  be  considered  a  ‘classic’ 
example of cyber espionage by a Spear Phishing attack. John 
Podesta,  Hillary  Clinton’s  campaign  manager,  and  Colin 
Powell, the former U.S. Secretary of State, were deceived by 
fake phishing advertisements and their credentials were stolen 
by  the  Russian  hackers’  group,  Fancy  Bear.  All  the  mails 
between them and Hilary Clinton were then published on the 
webpage WikiLeaks [10]. 

A problem, such as this, could be not only experienced by 
state actors but also by the general public, who potentially are 
less protected. 

III. 

A SPEAR PHISHING MODEL  

The ‘theoretical model of Spear Phishing on social media’ 
developed by Michael Bossetta shows how illiberal regimes 
perform  this  kind  of  social  engineering  attack  to  assault 
Western democracies [11]. 

Although  Michael  Bossetta 

specific  context  was 
“political”, it could be argued that his theory is more widely 
applicable to the general public. This theory involves 5 steps 
through which the Phisher leads the spear-phishing attack: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  Collect 
Gathering information on a specific target by exploiting all 
the  available  information  shared  throughout  social  media  to 
increase the chances of a successful attack [12]. Actors have, 
at  this  point,  collected  personal  information  such  as  phone 
numbers, e-mail addresses, interests, working or educational 
history [13]. 

In  the  2017  French  election,  Facebook  detected  and 
blocked  24  profiles  collecting  information  about  Macron’s 
campaign. The actor behind those profiles was observing the 
victims  in  order  to  draw  up  an  elaborated  and  customised 
attack. The “bad actor”, using Bossetta’s term, was discovered 
to be the same one as in the American election, the Russian 
hacking group Fancy Bear [14]. 

2.  Construct 
Creating  fake  social  media  accounts  in  order  to  engage 
with  targets.  The  new  persona  usually  has  fabricated 
credentials which establish a common ground with the victim, 
very often, the same work organisation or university [15]. 

A Spear Phishing attack by Iranian hackers hit the Saudi 
Arabian organizations, by creating fake LinkedIn, Facebook, 
Twitter and Instagram accounts; “Mia Ash” which mimicked 
an  appealing  Romanian  female,  sharing  common  interests 
with the victims [16]. 

3.  Contact 
Contacting the victims. The first approach begins with the 
“friend  request”  and  once  accepted,  the  phisher  can  have 
access  to  non-public  information  about  the  target  [17].  
Another  way  of  contact  is  the  direct  message  which  could 
contain  the  infected  hyperlink.  In  the  American  election, 
mentioned above, the method of contact used by the Russian 
group was the advertising campaign. Using the algorithm, they 
calculated a strategic time when people were mostly online, to 
send tweets  likely to be clicked by  their  victims. The attack 
was 
those 
successful,  70%  of  people  clicked  on 
advertisements [18]. 

4.  Compromise 
Installing  malware  on  the  victim’s  device  in  order  to 
compromise  it  and  steal  information  [19].  This  is  what 
CyberCaliphate,  the  Isis-affiliated  group  did  in  2015,  they 
hacked  many  Youtube  and  Twitter  accounts  of  the  U.S. 
Central command’s employees to spread propaganda [20].  

Once malware is installed, the victim may be unaware, and 

attackers might remain undetected for years [21]. 

5.  Contagion 
The last step of this model is contagion. Bad actors could 
exploit  the  hacked  account  to  spread the  attack  over related 
people, magnifying the outcome [22]. 

As Bossetta explains: “Contagion is especially dangerous 
because threat actors can target vulnerable victims and scale 
up to bigger targets” [23]. 

In  the  case  of  the  U.S.  State  Department,  an  Iranian 
hackers’ group in 2015 managed to violate the administration 

department by compromising the Facebook accounts of young 
employees [24]. 

IV. 

HOW TO DEFEND AGAINST THE ATTACKS 

The protection against the Phishing and Spear Phishing 
attacks is provided through different layers of defence: 

1.  Automated tools 
Prevention  and detection  are  the  first  layer of protection 
against  Phishing  attacks,  thus  different  automated  tools  for 
Phishing detection have been implemented [25]: 

-  Anti-phishing e-mail tool on a server to block 

Phishing content. 

-  Websites containing blacklist of detected Phishing 

URLs and IP addresses. 

-  Browser extensions to assess whether a page is 

genuine or not (Phishing websites). 

Anti-phishing  e-mail  tools  are  meant  to  block  Phishing 
content such as link, contained in mails, at server and client 
levels and it is estimated that the 89.5% of infected mails are 
detected through this process. [37] 

Furthermore,  websites  containing  blacklists  of  detected 
Phishing URLs and IP addresses are used to assess whether a 
webpage  is  genuine  or  not  in  case  the  user  encounters  a 
possible  scam  link  which  asks  for  credentials  or  bank 
information. 

Many Browsers provide extensions meant to alert people 
about  a  not  genuine  page.  They  are  based  on  blacklist 
databases  of  old  detected  fraudulent  URLs,  regularly 
updated.[38] 

However,  although  researchers  have  suggested  these 
techniques to prevent Phishing attacks, Phishers are becoming 
ever-more  sophisticated  in  their  approaches  following  the 
structure, explained above, and creating strategies in order to 
bypass the Anti-Phishing tools [26]. 

2.  Decision-aid tools 
In  the  context  of  e-mails,  e-mails  filter  tools  are  not 
infallible,  whenever  the  infected  e-mails  step  over  the 
detection tool, people are called to make a decision concerning 
a webpage or link’s legitimacy [27].  

As a result, decision-aid tools were introduced as a second 
layer of protection in order to alert people regarding a detected 
fraudulent website: 

-  Dynamic security skins. 

integrity  of 

A tool which allows an external server to demonstrate 
the 
link  without 
compromising the machine and the information of the 
user [42].  

the  questionable 

-  Browser toolbars. 

A  Browser  toolbar  meant  to  provide  feedback  (red 
icon when the link is infective, orange if it is unknown 
or  green  if  secure)  upon  the  legitimacy  of  the  web 
page the user has opened [41]. 

-  Browser Phishing notifications. 

These  work  like  the  above  tools  (Browser  toolbars) 
but  the  feedback  given  to  the  user  is  a  “flash 
notification”,  which  makes  him  think  about  the 
integrity of the page and its provenance. 

 
 
 
 
- 

Sockets layer warnings.  

Although many Phishing attacks are carried out over 
HTTP protocol, a significant number run on websites 
for  which  SSL  certificates  have  been  issued  [39]. 
Sockets  layer  warnings  alert  users  regarding  an 
infective link running on the protocol HTTPS which 
should be, “theoretically”, secure [40]. 

These tools identify potential risks, actively or passively, 

to online user [28]: 

-  Active  warnings:  coloured  graphic  icons  that  catch 
user’s  attention,  by  making  users 
take  action 
regarding  the danger (either  closing  the  webpage  or 
continuing). 

- 

Passive  warnings:    coloured  graphic  icons  which 
notify users about a possible danger without blocking 
their activity. 

3.  Training and knowledge 
 “Yet,  the  decision-aid  tools  have  been  evidenced  as 
ineffective  with  usability  issues.  Users  showed  lack  of 
understanding of the decision aid warnings in general” [29]. 

“The  last  line  of  defence  is  your  human  firewall”  [30], 
hence  training  and  knowledge  have  proved  to  be  the  most 
useful and crucial layer of protection; prior researches, indeed, 
showed  that  knowledge  gained  from  training  enhanced 
effectiveness  of  a  Phishing  warning  making  people  act 
safely[31]. 

4.  External protection 
A part these 3 layers, another form of protection could be 
provided  by  Multi  Factor  Authentication  (MFA),  a  security 
system  which  certifies  users’  identity  by  involving  multiple 
credentials [44].  

The Single factor authentication, which implies the user to 
enter  only  his  credentials  (usually  mail  or  username  and 
password)  in  order  to  get  the  access  to  either  a  website  or 
system, has to be replaced by two-factor authentication (2FA) 
or better multi-factor authentication (MFA) [43].  

Indeed,  rather  than  just  asking  for  a  username  and 
password, MFA needs other credentials, e.g. fingerprint, facial 
recognition or an answer to a pre-set question [48]. 

In cases where the bad actor is attempting to obtain user 
login  credentials,  multi-factor  authentication  (MFA)  has 
proved to be a key defence. In the worst-case scenario MFA 
mitigates  the  malicious  actor’s  ability  to  log  in  to  a  given 
account or server, limiting the damage [34]. 

MFA  is  an  effective  way  to  provide  enhanced  security, 
creating a further  layer  of  protection. Traditional usernames 
and  passwords  may  be  stolen  by  the  Phisher  and  scammer, 
through  Phishing  and  Spear  Phishing  [47].  Moreover, 
credentials could be found through the brute force attacks or 
be  already  published  on  the  deep  web,  visible  to  anyone 
looking for databases breaches. 

Here below there are some examples of different MFA: 

-  Codes generated by mobile applications. 

-  Codes generated by mobile USB. 

- 

Fingerprints. 

-  Codes sent via SMS or email.  

- 

- 

Facial recognition. 

Iris scan  

-  Answer to pre-set personal questions 

What is more, MFA functionality refers to 3 different types 
of “authentication factors” [45]: 

-  What  you  are:  authenticated  by  biometrics,  such  as 

fingerprints or iris scan. 

-  What you have: authenticated by a code sent via mail 

or SMS. 

-  What you know: authenticated by a password or PIN. 

Multi-factor  authentication  does  not  offer  a  foolproof 
protection,  but 
than  one 
the  combination  of  more 
authentication makes hacker’s work harder to get into users’ 
account.  

V. 

CONCLUSION 

After the disclosure of  the  Cambridge  Analytica  scandal 
and the Russian interference in the America election of 2016, 
social  media  platforms  removed  more  than  one  thousand 
accounts  related  to  the  manipulation  in  order  to  limit  the 
hacking activity [32]. 

In  addition,  several  Anti-Phishing  tools  have  been 
implemented and Decision-aid tools were introduced in order 
to help people make the right choice when they come across a 
possible Phishing danger. 

Different  examples  of  Spear  Phishing  used  for  political 
reason, given in this paper, demonstrate  that every network, 
even the most protected and sensible ones, can be exploited 
and hacked. Social engineering with Phishing and specifically 
Spear  Phishing  attacks  are  based  on  Human  emotionality, 
making their detection more difficult.  

Physical  defence  layers  are,  undoubtedly,  useful  but  not 
enough [46]; people have to be trained in order to achieve the 
awareness that not every page or link is genuine, everything 
has  to  be  questioned  and  assessed,  even  a  message  from  a 
person who pretends to be a friend [33]. 

In  addition,  as  the  recent  Hacking  Humans  podcast 
suggests, attackers hold advantage over the users: “It’s not like 
a military operation, where the defender is meant to have most 
of the advantages. In cyberspace, the attacker can just keep 
trying and probing at low risk and low cost and he only has to 
be  successful  once.  And  e-mails  filters  designed  to  keep 
malicious scams out have a 10.5%  failure rate. That sounds 
pretty good but is not 0%. This isn’t baseball, if your technical 
defence  fails  in  1  out  of  10  tries,  you  are  out  of  luck  and 
business. The last line of defense is your human firewall” [35]. 

To conclude, a constant and updated training helps people 
to be less vulnerable to these attacks, changing the fortunes of 
this “cyber war”. MFA may also enhance users defence layer 
in case  their credentials have already been stolen, becoming 
the “very” last wall of protection.
