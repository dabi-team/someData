Abstract

Electric power grids are critical infrastructure that support modern society by supplying electric energy to critical
infrastructure systems. Incidents are increasing that range from natural disasters to cyber attacks. These incidents
threaten the reliability of power systems and create disturbances that aﬀect the whole society. While existing standards
and technologies are being applied to proactively improve power system reliability and resilience, there are still
widespread electricity outages that cause billions of dollars in economic loss annually and threaten societal function
and safety. Improving resilience in preparation for such events warrants strategic network design to harden the system.
This paper presents an approach to strengthen power system security and reliability against disturbances by expanding
the network structure from an ecosystems perspective.

Ecosystems have survived a wide range of disturbances over a long time period, and an ecosystem’s robust structure
has been identiﬁed as the key element for its survivability. In this paper, we ﬁrst present a study of the correlation
of ecological robustness and power system structures. Then, we present a mixed-integer nonlinear programming
problem (MINLP) that expands the transmission network structure to maximize ecological robustness with power
system constraints for an improved ability to absorb disturbances. We solve the MINLP problem for the IEEE 24 Bus
Reliability Test System and three synthetic power grids with 200-, 500- and 2000-buses, respectively. Our evaluation
results show the optimized power systems have increased the network’s robustness, more equally distributed power
ﬂows, and less violations under diﬀerent levels of contingencies.

1. Introduction

Power grids deliver the electric energy that ensures
the functionality of modern society. This reliance re-
quires modern power grids to be reliable and secure,
but an aging infrastructure and continually increasing
demands make the existing network more vulnerable
to physical disturbances and natural disasters [1, 2, 3].
The integration of communication networks into crit-
ical infrastructure further increases the risk of cyber-
originated and combined cyber-physical attacks, which
can cause unexpected power outages [4, 5].
It is es-
sential to improve a power system’s inherent abilities
of preparing for, ensuring and recovering from extreme

events. Constructing resilient grid networks lays the
foundation for such inherent abilities.

Resilience is a property of systems that describes
their ability to operate during and recover from ad-
verse situations to resume normal operations. Re-
silience depends on the system’s elements, their conﬁg-
uration and interactions, and the surrounding environ-
ment [6]. From a regional transmission operator per-
spective, Chen et al. emphasize the necessity of con-
structing a robust grid to allow operators to address var-
ious contingencies on any given day [7]. In [8], Moreno
et al. point out that modern power grids need to incorpo-
rate resilience against extreme events into the network
planning process. In [9], Gholami et al. list diﬀerent
areas of resilience enhancement regarding system plan-
ning and operations, where the planning (long-term)
resilience enhancements lay the foundation for opera-
tional (short-term) resilience enhancements, and oper-

ational (short-term) resilience enhancements guide the
planning strategies (long-term). These works highlight
the importance of network construction for enhancing
power system resilience against adversaries, while mo-
tivating the need to better understand and characterize
how to utilize network design eﬀectively against ex-
treme events.

There are various frameworks and metrics that have
been proposed to capture a power system’s resilience
that consider the system’s operation status, network
structure, equipment, and hazards. Several works also
consider design-based system approaches. For exam-
ple, in [10], Ouyang and Duenas-Osorio present a prob-
abilistic modeling approach to quantify power system
resilience under a hurricane. Diﬀerent approaches were
analyzed for their ability to improve power system re-
silience and reduce economic loss, ﬁnding that orga-
nizational resilience can improve both goals. Prior
work has also pointed out that redundant and robust
network structures are eﬀective for improving power
system resilience under extreme conditions [11, 12].
A series of resilience metrics, based on a multi-phase
resilience trapezoid for power system operational and
infrastructure resilience [11], and sequential Monte-
Carlo-based time-series simulation models to assess
power system resilience [12], have been used. An al-
ternate availability-based engineering resilience metric
using a dynamic Bayesian network evaluation method-
ology was used to emphasize the importance of compo-
nent redundancy in increasing power system resilience
[13]. These works all support the ability to construct a
robust and redundant power grid network such that the
system’s ability to absorb disturbances is improved and
the power supply is ensured during disturbances. These
works proactively quantify power system resilience un-
der various contingencies and suggest speciﬁc enhance-
ment methods for particular elements, such as to add re-
dundant protection devices for critical assets or to con-
struct redundant branches for the vulnerable ones, but
they do not provide a quantitative guideline to design a
robust and redundant power grid network to enhance its
inherent ability of absorbing disturbances.

A promising system design approach for improv-
ing grid resilience uses inspiration from ecosystems
to translate their survivability traits to power grids.
Ecosystems have evolved over millions of years to sur-
vive disturbances. This long-term work to model and
understand these characteristics of ecosystems results
in a potentially novel benchmark for robust, sustain-
able, and eﬃcient networks design. Prior work has
shown that the resilience of ecosystems can success-
fully be translated to water distribution networks [14],

supply chains [15, 16], industrial by-product networks
[17], and more general large scale systems of systems
[18, 19]. Previous work by the authors has also applied
ecological robustness to power system network design.
The work was able to use network topology with power
ﬂow information, observing an improvement of power
system robustness and reliability [20, 21]. The ap-
proach uses the quantitative graph theory-based metric
ecological robustness [22, 23] as an optimization goal
for steady state directional graph representations of the
human networks.

In [20, 21], the optimization model focuses on the
network structure without explicitly including power
system constraints, such as the power balance equations
and operating limits. Thus, the optimization process
searches the whole domain for the optimal solution and
only checks power system feasibility post-optimization,
which reduces its eﬃciency, making it only solvable
with small cases. The optimization model in [20, 21] is
based on a common power system approximation called
the Direct Current (DC) power ﬂow, which does not
consider power losses, bus voltage, and reactive power
support. While the DC power ﬂow is a simple and often
useful mechanism to estimate real power ﬂows, the opti-
mized network structure found using this approximation
may be suboptimal for power system operation which is
best represented with the full Alternating Current (AC)
power ﬂow equations.

Ecological robustness has further been improved in
grid studies while considering power system constraints
by modeling the problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP) problem that solves for a bio-
inspired robust power network design [24]. A binary de-
cision variable was introduced for candidate branches,
so that the ecological robustness was dependent on bi-
nary decision variables as well as the power ﬂow distri-
bution. The optimal ecological robustness decided the
construction of candidate branches and the power ﬂow
distribution. The proposed MINLP problem was built
with the transmission network expansion (TNEP) model
in PowerModels.jl [25]. However, the formulation
of ecological robustness associates with logarithm func-
tions, which requires the entries’ domain to be positive.
With the integration of power ﬂow models, the MINLP
problem in [24] is a non-convex, nonlinear problem.
Thus, the previous MINLP was unable to guarantee fea-
sible solutions for large power system cases.

This paper relaxes the formulation of ecological ro-
bustness with a Taylor Series Expansion for the loga-
rithm functions to ensure the validity of the proposed
optimization model.
It also proposes an algorithm to
limit the searching domain, which improves the solv-

ability and eﬃciency of the proposed optimization prob-
lem. The proposed ecological robustness-oriented ap-
proach with the above relaxations is then able to solve
the bio-inspired power network design problem for
large synthetic power system cases, with results eval-
uated for 200-, 500-, and 2000-bus synthetic grids, ex-
plicitly including the power system constraints. The op-
timized networks show that ecological robustness can
be used to guide power grid network design with better
network properties, reliability and maintaining the op-
erational requirements.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

• A comprehensive study of ecological robustness
applied to power grid network structure for large
scale power system cases is presented. The re-
sults show that a design algorithm based on the
ecological robustness trait strategically constructs
the power grid network for reliability and surviv-
ability, with reduced violations under power grid
measures of N − x contingency analysis.

• The formulation of ecological robustness is re-
laxed using a Taylor Series Expansion, enabling
a proposed scalable ecological robustness oriented
power network expansion. This formulation is
solved for four power system case studies with 24-
, 200-, 500-, and 2000-bus systems respectively.
These cases are signiﬁcantly larger and more com-
plex than those that have been previously been able
to be studied.

• The original and optimized power grids are ana-
lyzed and compared regarding their network prop-
erties, such as robustness, node degree, central-
ity measures, etc., and reliability under diﬀerent
severities of contingencies. The increased robust-
ness,
increased node degree, reduced centrality
measures, and reduced violations under contingen-
cies highlight the networks’ improvements result-
ing from the biological inspiration.

2. Related Work

The quantiﬁcation of ecosystem robustness using in-
formation theory is presented in [22]. Ecological Ro-
bustness, RECO, is formulated as a function of two op-
posing but complementary attributes: unutilized reserve
capacity that can be thought of as pathway redundancy
and eﬀective performance or pathway eﬃciency, with
Equations (1-4).

where Development Capacity (DC) is the maximum
amount of aggregated uncertainty that a network can
have [26]; Ascendency (ASC) reﬂects the order or
dependence between events [27]; and Total System
Throughput (TSTp) is the system size, measured by to-
tal units circulated [28].

Calculating RECO requires information contained in
the Ecological Flow Matrix (EFM) [T], which is a
square (N+3) × (N+3) matrix containing ﬂow magni-
tude information between components in the network.
N is the number of actors inside the system boundaries
and the extra entries represent the system inputs, useful
system exports, and dissipation or system exports that
are lost [29]. The formulation of RECO quantiﬁes robust-
ness as a function of pathway redundancy and eﬃciency,
which has been shown in ecosystems to be directly re-
lated to their long-term survival [22].

Ecosystems and power systems share a lot of com-
monalities regarding energy transition, sustainability of
energy usage, and a required resilience against disrup-
tions. Modeling power systems as analogous to a food
web, which is a prey-predator model of an ecosystem,

has been shown to enable the construction of an Eco-
logical Flow Matrix with real power ﬂow for ecologi-
cal robustness optimization and analysis [20, 21]. The
analogy between power grids and food webs sets the
food web actors as corresponding to power grid compo-
nents such as generators and buses. The system inputs
correspond to energy supplied to generators from out-
side the system boundaries. The useful exports are the
consumer loads (consumption) and the dissipation are
power losses the system experiences. The entries in [T]
are notated as Ti j and represent the directed ﬂow from
node i to node j, corresponding to real power ﬂows.

Figure 1 shows the RECO curve for ﬁve small power
grid case studies alongside their biologically-optimized
versions [21] and a set of 38 food webs. The eco-
logical robustness of original power networks can be
seen to be much lower than that of food webs, indicat-
ing the grid network structure has less pathway redun-
dancy in comparison to these biological networks. The
biologically-optimized power networks, which were re-
designed to maximize RECO while still meeting all loads,
successfully increased their ecological robustness in all
cases by restructuring the grid with additional and al-
tered pathways between components. The optimization
done in [21] found that the resultant shift towards a
higher RECO improved the reliability of all the grids un-
der N −1, N −2, and N −3 contingencies. Figure 2 shows
the normalized power system violations for original and
bio-optimized power networks under contingencies. For

power systems, the power ﬂow on branches, both trans-
formers and transmission lines, and the voltage on buses
should be maintained within their physical and operat-
ing limits [30]. For N-x contingency analysis, if there
is one branch’s power ﬂow is over the limit or the volt-
age magnitude is out of the required limit, it is counted
as one violation. The violations can be seen to have
been reduced by the bio-inspired redesigns in all of the
5 grid cases. While promising, this prior work [20, 21]
unfortunately was unable to apply the bio-inspired op-
timization eﬃciently enough to make it applicable to
large power system cases - resulting in an inability to
study the potential success of the approach for more re-
alistically sized grids.

A promising approach preliminarily investigated in
[24] was to use PowerModels.jl [25] to combine the
bio-inspired power network problem with its network
expansion problem. The proposed MINLP in [24] in-
tegrates the power ﬂow constraints with ecological ro-
bustness as the objective function. Unlike the optimiza-
tion problem in [20, 21] that searches all possible net-
work structures, the MINLP approach deﬁnes the possi-
ble connections to improve the eﬃciency while sacriﬁc-
ing a globally-optimal solution. Comparing the results
in [24] and [21], the MINLP solution improves the net-
work reliability under N − 1 contingency and solves sig-
niﬁcantly faster. However, the optimization formulation
in [24] fails to capture the feasible space, since Equa-
tions 1-3 involve the logarithm function (whose inputs

Ecological Robustness and Power Network Struc-

ture

Ecological robustness was ﬁrst applied to power grids
with the goal of creating a “bio-inspired” network de-
sign in [21], showing that the resultant biologically-
optimized networks improved both the robustness and
reliability of the grids. Understanding if the biologi-
cal optimization inherently adds value to the design of
power grids is diﬃcult, however, as for the small-scale
cases tested in that work all resulted in branches being
added, and added branches will almost certainly im-
prove grid reliability somewhat. This leaves the ques-
tion: with a set number of lines available, can ecological
robustness create a more resilient grid? The relationship
among added links, network structure, and ecological
robustness in power systems needs to be better under-
stood. A comprehensive study of ecological robustness
is thus performed in this section, highlighting the resul-
tant power system structures with diﬀerent number of
links for all the cases from [21]. The results conﬁrm
from an engineering perspective that ecological robust-
ness is a function of the number of links, the network’s
structure, and its function (power ﬂows).

Figure 3 shows the results for a 5-, 6-, 7-, 9-, and 14-
bus case when links are added to the original structure
until all buses are connected and all possible network
structures have been considered. The corresponding
ecological robustness is then calculated for each topol-
ogy. For example, the original 5-bus case has 7 links (5
branches connecting buses and 2 links connecting a bus
and generator). Since the connection between bus and
generator is already one-to-one, added links only occur
between buses. One link is added to the original net-
work in every possible location and the power ﬂow for
the new network structure is calculated (for which elec-
trical parameters, such as resistance, reactance, limits,
etc., must be assigned to the new branches). For simpli-
ﬁcation, the mean value of the existing branches’ elec-
trical parameters are used. The ecological robustness is
then calculated for each architecture.

The 5-bus, 6-bus, and 7-bus cases cover every pos-
sible new architecture for each added link. The 9-bus
and 14-bus cases however can have thousands of diﬀer-
ent structures for each number of links. Thus, a uniform
distribution of network structures under a certain num-
ber of links is assumed. Each network architecture has a
unique ecological robustness thus the ecological robust-
ness for a set number of links also has a uniform dis-
tribution [33]. 150 network structures were randomly
selected from all possible network structures for the 9-
and 14-bus cases to represent the relationship between

must be positive), while the input for RECO is power ﬂow
(whose direction can change during the solving pro-
cess and making entries of Ti j become negative). This
creates a problem for large cases where ﬂow direction
changes are more prevalent.

This paper relaxes the formulation of RECO based on
the Taylor Series Expansion for the logarithm function
making it able to solve a relaxed MINLP for the IEEE
24 Bus Reliability Test System (RTS)[31] and the syn-
thetic 200-, 500-, and 2000-bus power grids from [32].

ecological robustness and added links.

Figure 3 supports that while increasing the number
of links in the network does generally enable a higher
maximum ecological robustness, the maximum RECO
does not correspond to the grid architecture with the
most links (Figure 3b-e). These results conﬁrm that
using ecological robustness as a design guideline can
guide the placement of new links and maximizing RECO
does more than just add links: diﬀerent network struc-
tures have diﬀerent ecological robustness with a vari-
ance around 5%. Moreover, adding unnecessary links
can reduce ecological robustness - or just because more
links are added does not ensure that RECO will increase.
These results show that ecological robustness metric,
and the characteristic of biological food webs to max-
imize RECO with a unique balance of pathway eﬃciency
vs. redundancy, can be a non-obvious design guideline
for selecting power ﬂow pathways such that it strategi-
cally guides the network construction for reliability and
survivability.

4. Ecological Robustness Oriented Power Network

Expansion

A mixed-integer nonlinear optimization model for
ecological robustness oriented power network expan-
sion was proposed in [24], where the optimiza-
tion model constructs the power networks to achieve
the maximal ecological robustness while maintain-
ing power ﬂow constraints.
This section reviews
the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem
(MINLP) model and presents the relaxation scheme us-
ing a Taylor Series Expansion for the logarithm function
to solve the problem for large power systems.

4.1. Mixed-Integer Optimization Model

The ecological robustness oriented power network
expansion problem is built upon the Transmission Net-
work Expansion Planning (TNEP) problem and imple-
mented using PowerModels.jl with the objective of
achieving optimal ecological robustness (RECO). The
ecological robustness is calculated through [T], whose
entries are generator power outputs, branch power
ﬂows, losses, and load. The TNEP problem is formu-
lated as a mixed-integer optimization problem where
each candidate branch has a binary decision variable αij
for the candidate branch from bus i to bus j. The ini-
tial value of αij = zero means the corresponding branch
does not exist in the original network. If the resulting
αij after optimization equals one, the branch is built to
reach a maximum RECO.

tion (5a) is formulated through Equation (1)-(4). The
input of the objective function is [T], which consists of
generator real power output Pgeni, real power ﬂow Pi j
from existing branches and candidate branches, power
consumption at each load Ploadi, power loss Plossi at
each bus, and binary decision variables αi j for candi-
date branches. Figure 4 illustrates the formulation of
[T] with the above entries. Matrix [T] gives the energy
transitions among actors and extra system inputs, use-
ful exports and dissipation. The system inputs are from
generators, so the ﬁrst row consists of Pgeni. Generators
and buses are modeled as actors, so the energy transi-
tions between them are also Pgeni. Among buses, the
energy transitions are ﬁlled with Pi j and Pnei j, where
the Pi j are the existing branches’ power ﬂows and Pnei j
are the candidate branches’ power ﬂows depending on
= αi j Pi j for candidate
the decision variable αi j (Pnei j
branches). The outputs are the loads at each bus, which
are the ﬁxed value of Ploadi. The dissipation are the en-
ergy loss at each actor.

The dissipation at each generator is modeled as zero
since the generators send power directly to the system.
However, it is worthwhile to mention that the energy
dissipation caused by generating electricity from vari-
ous sources can be considered in this model for further
assessment. Buses do not have energy dissipation but
the branches connected to the bus do, thus the branch
losses for each bus are aggregated using Equation (5m)
to formulate the Plossi, which also depends on the power
ﬂow dispatch. A more indepth investigation of the mod-
eling process for line losses when lines are modeled as
directional graph nodes can be found in [34]. Equations
(5c) - (5l) ensure the network structure is satisﬁed with
power balance and power system operational constraints
with the AC power ﬂow model for real power (P) and
reactive power (Q).

Power ﬂow dispatch depends on the real (Pi) and
reactive power (Qi) injection at each bus, bus voltage
(voltage magnitude Vi, voltage angle θi), and the net-
work structure [35]. Variables for the proposed prob-
lem include each generator’s real and reactive power
input Pgeni and Qgeni, each bus’ voltage magnitude Vi
and voltage angle θi, and the binary decision variable
αi j for candidate branches. The Ecological Robustness
Oriented Power Network Expansion Problem can thus
optimize the network structure and power ﬂow dispatch
to maximize RECO.

mulation of ecological robustness RECO: a typical class
of NP-hard problems [36]. Moreover, for the logarithm
function, the domain of the function must be positive.
The input for Equations (1) - (3) depends on the power
ﬂow (Pi j) magnitude and direction. However, Pi j is
solved based on Vi, θi, Pgeni , Qgeni and αi. During the
optimization process, the solution is not guaranteed to
fall in the domain for the logarithm function, which can
make the model invalid. As in [24], when the proposed
MINLP was solved for large cases or used the AC power
ﬂow model, it is unable to solve using the Ipopt [37],
Juniper [38], and Cbc [39] tools because of an invalid
mathematical model. Taylor Series Expansion of the
natural logarithm function is thus used here to relax the
formulation of ecological robustness for proposed prob-
lem’s feasibility in larger power system cases.

There are several Taylor Series Expansions for the
natural logarithm function. Considering the domain for
the expansion, this paper utilizes the following relax-

by adapting the ﬁrst order Taylor Series Expansion of
Equations (6) and (8) into Equation (1) - (3), the formu-
lation of RECO is relaxed in Algorithm 1. The relaxed
Ecological Robustness Oriented Power Network Expan-
sion problem can then be applied to large power grid
networks successfully (even with ﬂow direction changes
during the optimization process).

system cases:
the IEEE 24 Bus RTS [31] and three
synthetic grids from [32] (ACTIVSg200 200-bus sys-
tem, ACTIVSg500 500-bus system, and ACTIVSg2000
2000-bus system). The IEEE 24 Bus RTS is used
for testing various reliability analysis methods. The
synthetic cases are satisﬁed with the statistical char-
acters of actual grids without compromising the con-
ﬁdentiality of real systems. They have been evaluated
for topology connectivity, overlap with the Delaunay
triangulation and minimum spanning tree of the sub-
stations, AC power ﬂow convergence, and geographic
intersections between same-voltage-level transmission
lines [32]. However, these cases do not have the data
for network expansion. This section introduces an algo-
rithm to generate candidate branches for synthetic grids
and solves the Ecological Robustness Oriented Power
Network Expansion problem for each.

5.1. Use Case Creation

The proposed Ecological Robustness Oriented Power
Network Expansion is built upon the TNEP problem
in PowerModels.jl, which requires the information of
candidate branches. The original synthetic grids do not
have the candidate branches to expand the network, so
we use the Algorithm 2 to create the candidate branches
based on the existing grid information. In power system
modeling, the construction of transformers will create
extra buses, so the candidate branches in this paper cre-
ated by Algorithm 2 are transmission lines that connect
buses at the same voltage level.

Algorithm 2 provides a Naive way to create the candi-
date branches by connecting buses at the same voltage

level. The algorithm assumes the candidate branches
follow a uniform distribution. The input for Algorithm
2 is the case’s bus and branch information. Algorithm
2 classiﬁes the existing branches into diﬀerent voltage
levels and generates normal distributions for diﬀerent
parameters at each voltage level. The normal distri-
bution is always used to represent the real-valued ran-
dom variables. With the mean and variance of existing
branches’ parameters, the generated normal distribution
can be used to select the candidate branches’ parameters
to ﬁt with the original case. The synthetic grids have
hundreds of buses, resulting in a huge number of possi-
ble branches. Thus, all possible branches are assumed
to have the same probability to be selected and the al-
gorithm selects M candidate branches from all possible
branches. As in Section 3, even with random sampling,
RECO is able to select a network construction with an
ecologically-similar balance of pathway eﬃciency and
redundancy. Algorithm 1 can guide the network ex-
pansion with candidate branches from Algorithm 2 to
achieve the optimal ecological robustness. Additional
information such as geographic location, cost, and gov-
ernment policies can further improve the realism when
considering diﬀerent candidate branches.

5.2. Results

Algorithm 1 is applied to four power system cases
(the IEEE 24 Bus Reliability RTS and three synthetic
grids) to redesign their network under the guidance of
ecological robustness RECO. Since these grids do not
have candidate branch information, Algorithm 2 cre-
ated 50, 100, 150, and 200 candidate branches for each

case, respectively (each grid has a unique set of candi-
date branches). All scenarios are solved with both AC
and DC power ﬂow models.

The DC power ﬂow model treats the system as loss-
less with G = 0 and voltage magnitudes of all buses are
assumed constant at 1.0 per unit. Additionally, the angle
diﬀerence between two buses is small, such that cos(θi j)
= 1 and sin(θi j) = θi - θ j [35]. Thus, Q = 0 and the Equa-
tion (5i), (5j), and (5l) can be removed from Algorithm
1. Equation (5g) and (5h) can simpliﬁed as:

Pi j = Bi j(θi − θ j) (∀(i, j) ∈ B)

(9)

Pi j = αi jBi j(θi − θ j) (∀(i, j) ∈ NB)
(10)
For transmission networks, there are diﬀerent volt-
age ratings in the system. The higher the voltage rat-
ing is, the further the power can be transferred. The
highest voltage transmission lines are the backbone of
transmission network. Thus, the candidate branches are
selected with the highest voltage ratings. As mentioned
earlier, the proposed algorithm not only solves the net-
work structure, it also solves the optimal power ﬂow dis-
patch with a output vector of generator setpoints. The
resultant network design is analyzed with both the op-
timized network structure and the optimized network

5.2.1. IEEE 24 Bus Reliability Test System (RTS)

The IEEE 24 Bus Reliability Test System (RTS) [31]
has 24 buses and 37 branches. The online generation
limits are 3405 MW and 1776 MVAR for real and reac-
tive power respectively, and they support 2850 MW and
580 MVAR load in the system. With 24 buses, there are
276 links that can be selected as candidate branches to
expand the network structure. After applying both the
DC and AC power ﬂow models for four scenarios with
50, 100, 150 and 200 candidate branches respectively,
the problem can only be solved using the DC power ﬂow
model with the termination status of Locally Solved.
With the AC power ﬂow model, the termination status
is LOCALLY INFEASIBLE without the solution of
the proposed problem. Thus, the results in Table 1 are
solved by the DC power ﬂow model only. Fig. 5 shows
the network structure with expansion from the original
24 bus case to the ecological robustness oriented net-
work considering 50 candidate branches. Fig. 5(a) is
the original topology of 24 Bus RTS; the blue links in
Fig. 5(b) are the candidate branches for 24 Bus RTS;
the red links in Fig. 5(c) are branches built under the
guidance of optimal ecological robustness.

Table 1 lists all the scenarios for the IEEE 24 Bus
RTS with diﬀerent numbers of candidate branches that
when solved resulted in the same RECO value of 0.3431
for the Optimal RECO from the Ipopt solver. The Op-
timal RECO is the mathematical optimal value solved
from the model of Algorithm 1 with the relaxation of
Equation (8). The relaxed formulation of RECO with
Equation (8) means that the real RECO achieved in each
case can be diﬀerent. Thus, RECO is recalculated for
each case based on its optimized network structure and
power ﬂows, as listed in column Achieved RECO. The
results of Achieved RECO show that the optimized net-
works have a higher RECO than the original case and the

-OPF networks have a higher RECO than the -Structure
networks (except for the 100 candidate branch sce-
nario). The number of built branches does not in-
crease with increasing numbers of candidate branches.
This conﬁrms that the proposed Algorithm 1 utilizes the
RECO to strategically construct the network structure to
improve the system’s RECO and maintain power system
constraints.

Table 2 are solved by the DC power ﬂow model only.
Fig. 6 shows the network structure expands from the
original 200 bus case to the ecological robustness ori-
ented network with 50 candidate branches. Fig. 6(a) is
the original topology of ACTIVSg200; the blue links in
Fig. 6(b) are the candidate branches for ACTIVSg200;
the red links in Fig. 6(c) are branches built under the
guidance of optimal ecological robustness.

5.2.2. ACTIVSg200

The ACTIVSg200 [32] has 200 buses and 246
branches with 3426.84 MW and 1346.57 MVAR online
generation limits to support 2178.05 MW and 620.68
MVAR load in the system. With 200 buses, there are
19900 links that can be selected as candidate branches
to expand the network structure. After applying both
DC and AC power ﬂow models for four scenarios with
50, 100, 150 and 200 candidate branches respectively,
the problem can only be solved using the DC power ﬂow
model with the termination status of Locally Solved.
With the AC power ﬂow model and increasing the
max iter to 50000, the solver stops due to Restora-
tion Failed without any solution. Thus, the results in

In Table 2, the results for the ACTIVSg200 cases are
similar to the IEEE 24 Bus RTS. The solved Optimal
RECO is 0.3431 for all scenarios, but the Achieved RECO
values are smaller. Considering there are 19900 pos-
sible links, the created 200 candidate branch may not
have the optimal structure. However, the optimized net-
works show improved network properties and reliabil-
ity, which is further discussed in the next section. For
the ACTIVSg200 cases, all -OPF networks have higher
than their corresponding -Structure networks. Also, the
number of built branches do not increase with the in-
creasing of candidate branches.

5.2.3. ACTIVSg500

The ACTIVSg500 [32] has 500 buses and 599
branches with 6455.78 MW and 3899.35 MVAR online
generation limits to support 5001.67 MW and 1333.8
MVAR load in the system. With 500 buses, there are
124750 links can be selected as candidate branches to
expand the network structure. After applying the both
DC and AC power ﬂow models for four scenarios (50,
100, 150 and 200 candidate branches, respectively), the
problem can only be solved using a DC power ﬂow
model with the termination status of Locally Solved.
The AC power ﬂow model and increasing the max iter
to 50000, the solver stops due to Restoration Failed
without any solution. Thus, the results in Table 3 are
from the DC power ﬂow model. Figure 7 shows the net-
work structure expands from the original ACTIVSg500
case to the ecological robustness oriented network with
50 candidate branches. Figure 7(a) is the original topol-
ogy of ACTIVSg500; the blue links in Figure 7(b) are
the candidate branches for ACTIVSg500; the red links
in Figure 7(c) are branches built under the guidance of
optimal ecological robustness.

The results for the ACTIVSg500 cases are in Ta-
ble 3, which is similar to the ACTIVSg200 case. The
solved Optimal RECO is 0.3431 for all scenarios, but
the Achieved RECO are smaller. Considering there
are 124750 possible links, the created 200 candidate
branch may not have the optimal structure. Moreover,
with 200 candidate branches, the optimized network
doesn’t build new branch. The computation time for the
ACTIVSg500-200-OPF is much longer than other sce-
narios. Compared with other cases, far fewer branches
are added in the ACTIVSg500 case.

5.2.4. ACTIVSg2000

The ACTIVSg2000 [32] has 2000 buses and 3206
branches with 6455.78 MW and 3899.35 MVAR on-
line generation capability to support 5001.67 MW and
1333.8 MVAR load in the system.
2000 buses re-
sults in 1999000 links that can be selected as candidate
branches to expand the network’s structure. After ap-
plying the both DC and AC power ﬂow models for four
scenarios (50, 100, 150 and 200 candidate branches,
respectively), the problem was again found to only be
solvable using a DC power ﬂow model with the termi-

nation status of Locally Solved. The AC power ﬂow
model and increasing the max iter to 50000 gives an
output of Restoration Failed without any solution.

The results for the ACTIVSg2000 cases are in Table 4
solved with DC power ﬂow model. The solved Optimal
RECO is 0.3431 for all scenarios, but no new branches

are added in any of the scenarios and the computation
time is much longer than in the other cases. Moreover,
the optimized networks their Achieved RECO are lower
than the original network. However, this doesn’t mean
the structure of ACTIVSg2000 case is ecologically op-
timal. The RECO of the ACTIVSg2000 cases are still

tality”. Since we only consider 200 candidate branches
using Algorithm 2, which is only a small portion from
all candidate branches, the optimal network structure is
identiﬁed from them.

The computation time for the ACTIVSg500-200-
OPF and cases in ACTIVSg2000 were signiﬁcantly
longer as compared to the other grid test cases. It sug-
gests that the proposed MINLP problem can be solved
very eﬃciently with a DC power ﬂow model when the
model is solved to optimize the network structure rather
than optimize the power ﬂow dispatch. This depends on
the set of candidate branches. If the optimal network
structure can be identiﬁed from the candidate branches,
the model is solved as optimizing the network structure.
If the optimal network structure is not identiﬁed with the
candidate branches, the model will search all possible
network structure and optimize the power ﬂow, which
cause the computation time much longer.

6. Network Analyses

The optimized networks are analyzed and compared
with their original network based on their network prop-
erties and power system reliability using PowerWorld
Simulator [41] and Easy SimAuto [42]. A simpliﬁed,
cost-eﬀective analysis is also presented for both the op-
timized network and original network. Since the struc-
ture of ACTIVSg2000 is not optimized, the analyses are
focused on the IEEE 24 Bus RTS, ACTIVSg200, and
ACTIVSg500.

Even though the proposed MINLP problem is only
solved with DC power ﬂow model, the optimized net-
work and the optimized network with OPF are analyzed
in the AC power ﬂow model in PowerWorld Simulator
[41]. All cases are initially solved using AC power ﬂow
model without any violations to examine the cases’ abil-
ity of absorbing disturbances.

6.1. Network Properties Comparison

Another entropy based network robustness metric
(RCF) is used to identify cascading failures in power
systems in [43]. The calculation of RCF is based on
the power ﬂow and network topology in the system as

All networks are analyzed here with typical complex
network properties, including the average node degree
( ¯d), clustering coeﬃcient (¯c), average betweenness cen-
trality measures (¯b) and average shortest path (¯l). The
power ﬂow distribution is investigated by calculating the
Mean and Standard Deviation (STD) of all branches’
power ﬂow (pf) and the line percentage of MVA limit

(p%). Table 5 shows the network properties for all
network structure and the corresponding optimal power
ﬂow, showing that the optimized networks have better
network properties than their original counterparts.

All the RECO optimized networks have higher RCF,
showing that the ecological robustness corresponds to
an improved robustness to cascading failures. Increas-
ing RCF is found to highly correlate with increasing

16

RECO, except in the optimized results of the IEEE 24
Bus RTS and the ACTIVSg500 case with 100 candi-
date branches. The optimized network structures in
both these cases have a slightly higher value of RECO
than the corresponding network with optimal power
ﬂow but lower RCFs. One interesting observation is
made for the ACTIVSg500-200-OPF: since the opti-
mized network doesn’t add any branches but only re-
distribute the power ﬂows to achieve a higher RECO,
the corresponding RCF is also increased. RECO and
RCF of the optimal power ﬂow are both higher than
in the ACTIVSg500-50-Structure, ACTIVSg500-50-
OPF, ACTIVSg500-100-Structure and ACTIVSg500-
100-OPF.

All the RECO optimized networks have larger ¯d and
¯c, and reduced ¯b and ¯l. The ACTIVSg200 and AC-
TIVSg500 are synthetic grids, whose complex network
properties are very close to actual grids. For actual net-
works, the ¯d is in the range of (2.58, 2.61), the ¯c is
in the range of (0.032, 0.058), the ¯b is in the range of
(0.083, 0.40), and the ¯l is in the range of (14.2, 29.2).
The results show that the optimized networks’ ¯d and ¯c
are close to the actual systems, but the ¯b and ¯l are not.
These can be explained by the way candidate branches
were selected at their highest voltage level for each case,
whose shortest distance is smaller than branches be-
tween diﬀerent voltage levels.

The Mean and Standard Deviation (STD) of all the
branches’ power ﬂow (pf) and line percentage of MVA
limits (p%) clearly show that the RECO optimized net-
works distribute their power ﬂow more equally than
the original network. The Mean (pf) and STD (pf) in
each optimized network with optimal power ﬂow are
smaller than the network with original generator set-
points, showing that the network with optimal power
ﬂows distribute real power more equally. However, for
the Mean(p%) and STD(p%), the the network with op-
timal power ﬂow has higher values than the correspond-
ing network structure, so the network distributes the
whole power (real and reactive power) less equally (still
better than the original network). This is because the
proposed MINLP problem is only solved with the DC
power ﬂow model (consider only the real power).

6.2. Network Reliability Comparison

N-1, N-2 and N-3 contingency analyses are done for
the IEEE 24 Bus RTS cases to see whether the ecolog-
ical robustness oriented networks perform better during
the disturbances. A comprehensive N-2 and N-3 con-
tingency analysis is diﬃcult to complete for the AC-
TIVSg200 and ACTIVSg500 cases due to the number
of network components and instead an N-1 contingency

17

analysis is done for the branch and substations respec-
tively. The loss of one substation can catastrophically
impact the entire system, providing a good validation
of the redesigned system’s ability to absorb large dis-
turbances. Additionally, Narimani et al. and Huang
et al. have utilized Line Outage Distribution Factors
(LODFs) and Group Betweenness Centrality (GBC) to
successfully identify sets of critical elements in syn-
thetic grids, whose out of service can cause the system
under stress [44, 45] . All the contingency analyses in-
vestigated here are performed without remedial actions.
Original functionalities, such as automatic generation
control (AGC) and automatic voltage regulator (AVR),
are retained at their original settings enabling the pro-
posed MINLP problem to be evaluated for its ability to
improve the grid’s ability to absorb unexpected emer-
gencies by strategically expanding the network.

Table 6 shows the N-1, N-2 and N-3 contingency anal-
ysis for all the IEEE 24 Bus RTS cases. Under the
N-1 contingency analysis, the IEEE 24 Bus RTS-50-
Structue and -150-Structue cases have less violations
than the original network. The IEEE 24 Bus RTS-50-
OPF, -100-Structue and -200-Structue have more viola-
tions. As to N-2 contingency analysis, except the IEEE
24 Bus RTS-50-OPF case and -100-Structure case, the
other cases have less violations. All the optimized net-
works have no unsolved situations to ensure the system
is observable to operators when contingencies happen.
The optimized networks have far fewer unsolved situa-
tions than the original network for the N-3 contingency
analysis, reduced from 148 to less than 20. The IEEE 24
Bus RTS-150-Structure, -200-Structure and -200-OPF
have fewer violations than the original network. The
IEEE 24 Bus RTS-150-Structure has the best reliability,
improving in all the tested N-x contingency analyses.
When considering the total number of N-x contingen-
cies, the normalized number violations (violations/total
number of contingencies) are reduced for all the cases
as well, as shown in Table 7.

Table 8 shows the contingency analysis for all AC-
TIVSg200 cases. All the optimized ACTIVSg200 cases
maintain the same N-1 reliability as the original net-
work. With the N-1 Substation contingency, all the opti-
mized networks are more reliable with fewer violations
and unsolved situations. With the critical contingencies
from [44, 45], all the optimized networks are found to be
more reliable than in their original form. ACTIVSg200-
200-OPF has the best performance out of all the opti-
mized network. Compared with the IEEE 24 Bus RTS
case, the original ACTIVSg200 has more generation ca-
pacity meaning that even with 51 new branches added
in this case, the generators are better able to support the

new network design.

Table 9 shows the contingency analysis for all the
ACTIVSg500 cases. The N-1 contingency analysis
(Branch) shows that the optimized networks do not im-
prove much in regards to the number of violations in
the system. However, for all cases, the extra viola-
tions come from voltage instability, which is associated
with the reactive power support from the system.
If
the system doesn’t have enough reactive power support
in the system, with the extra transmission lines built,
the system will experience more stress because of reac-
tive power insuﬃciency. The N-1 contingency analysis
(Substation) shows that the ACTIVSg500-100-OPF and
ACTIVSg500-150-OPF cases both improve the num-
ber of contingencies as compared to the original net-
work. The critical contingency analysis shows that the
ACTIVSg500-50-Structure, -50-OPF, -100-OPF and -
200-OPF cases are all more reliable than the original

network, resulting in a reduced number of violations
and no unsolved situations. The ACTIVSg500-200-
OPF stands out as a special grid case study in the anal-
ysis. The RECO optimized version of the network im-
proves the grid’s reliability during the tested critical
contingencies without adding any new branches. This
highlights the potential of RECO to guide the distribution
of power ﬂows to survive contingencies.

Even though the improvement for the ACTIVSg500
case is not as dramatic as is seen for the ACTIVSg200
case, the results show that with more real and reactive
power support the RECO optimization can improve the
network’s performance.

respect to their constructing. The cost analysis here as-
sumes the costs of all branches in all cases are the same.
The most cost-eﬀective network design and system
operation for the IEEE 24 Bus RTS case is the IEEE
24 Bus RTS-200-Structure. This was also the best per-
forming design (unsolved situations were reduced from
3 and 148, to 0 and 12, for the N-2 and N-3 contin-
gencies respectively), suggesting that the biological be-
havior described by maximizing RECO is able to min-
imize both violations AND cost. The ACTIVSg200-
150-Structure is the most cost-eﬀective network design
for the ACTIVSg200 case. Despite having more viola-
tions and unsolved situations than other optimized net-
works, it only adds ﬁve branches to maximize RECO.
The ACTIVSg500-100-OPF network design and oper-
ating point is the best performing design under contin-
gencies, with only one more branch built and adjusted
generator setpoints.

The proposed MINLP is only solved in the DC power
ﬂow model, which doesn’t consider the reactive power
in the system. The network design and expansion in
practice should consider the corresponding support of

real and reactive power. Added reactive power reserves
would further improve the eﬀectiveness of these net-
works. Moreover, investments in network architecture
also contribute to supporting load increases in the fu-
ture. A more detailed analysis of the cost-eﬀectiveness
of these biologically inspired network designs is needed
to consider the impact of increased loads, generation,
and a system’s power transfer capability. More real-
istic data for candidate branches, including construc-
tion costs and beneﬁts, would further validate the cost-
eﬀectiveness of ecological robustness as a guide for
power grid network design.

7. Discussion

Ecological robustness (RECO) quantiﬁes the balance
between pathway eﬃciency and redundancy in biologi-
cal food webs. The unique range of RECO that has been
found for food webs, known as the “window of vitality,”
has been hypothesized by ecologists to be the result of
their ability to both survive disturbances while simulta-
neously growing and developing [23, 28, 22]. Modeling

power systems as a food web directional graph, where
the nodes represent critical network actors and the edges
the ﬂow of materials/energy between them, enables the
application of RECO and the Window of Vitality to the
design of power grids. The method used here popu-
lates the Ecological Flow Matrix with the grid’s real
power ﬂows, setting up the maximization of RECO to
guide power network design. Prior work was only able
to show the success of this method for small grid test
cases. The relaxation of RECO proposed here, along with
the incorporation of power system constraints, formu-
lates a solvable MINLP problem for larger and more
realistic power grid networks. The analysis of both net-
work properties and reliability supports the use of this
biological characteristic as a novel method to improve
grid robustness and highlights additional improvements
including better network properties, more equally dis-
tributed power ﬂow over the system, and improved reli-
ability against unexpected contingencies.

The maximum value of RECO is 0.3679 (1/e), with
the original ecological formulation of RECO following
Equations (1)-(4). The proposed relaxation shifts this
maximum value to 0.3431 and enables its use for large

power system networks when coupled with the DC
power ﬂow model. The diﬀerence between the origi-
nal maximum of 0.3679 and the relaxed maximum of
0.3431 is acceptable considering only a ﬁrst order Tay-
lor Series Expansion is used.

After constructing the new branches from the candi-
date branches, the achieved RECO in each network are
diﬀerent from the solved optimal value. The value of
achieved RECO for IEEE 24 Bus RTS optimized net-
works are higher than the solved RECO. Besides, the
achieved RECO of IEEE 24 Bus RTS-200-Structure is
higher than IEEE 24 Bus RTS-150-Structure with less
branches built. Under diﬀerent candidate branch sets, it
shows that the RECO is strategically designing the net-
work structure to achieve an optimal RECO by selecting
the satisfying branches from candidate branches. For
the synthetic cases, the value of achieved RECO is much
less than the solved optimal RECO. The original syn-
thetic power grids are highly close to the real U.S power
grids, which are quite sparse and eﬃcient. The candi-
date branches for those cases are focused on the high
voltage branches and they are a small portion of all po-
tential branches in the system. Since RECO evaluates the

power ﬂow path eﬃciency and redundancy, with only a
few redundancy being added, the achieved RECO won’t
be as high as the optimal RECO. However, with the added
branches from the solved MINLP problem, there are im-
provement of RECO, network properties, and system’s
ability of absorbing disturbances and changes.

As shown in Section 6, the optimized network prop-
erties are overall better than the original network, which
shows the improvement of the system’s robustness.
With another entropy based robustness metric RCF [43],
the trend between RECO and RCF is highly correlated
with the optimized network and power ﬂow, which is
not entirely surprising as both metrics consider both the
network topology and power ﬂow in the system. The
trend is more interesting when one considers that RCF
only focuses on the grid’s robustness, as deﬁned by its
electrical nodal robustness and node signiﬁcance, while
RECO considers the eﬃciency and redundancy of power
ﬂow pathways in the network. The comparison of the
distribution of real power ﬂow and branches’ MVA per-
centage (p%), the optimized network structure with the

optimal power ﬂow settings distribute the real power
more equally over the network for all branches, but
they do not distribute the real and reactive power more
equally with the consideration of branch MVA limits.
Since the candidate branches created through Algorithm
2 utilizes the existing branches’ physical information
with normal distribution, their physical parameters are
correlated with existing branches. Thus, the less equally
distributed real and reactive power ﬂow is because of
the re-distributed reactive power, which is not captured
in the formulation of EFM and the MINLP is not solved
with AC power ﬂow model. For the reliability analysis,
there are improvements from the optimized network, es-
pecially the optimized ACTIVSg200 cases. All of them
have better reliability than the original network and the
improvements are signiﬁcant. With the data of online
real and reactive power capacity and loading for each
case, the ACTIVSg200 has the most reserves for ex-
tra branches, which ensures the optimized networks can
maintain both real and reactive consumption and the re-
liability during contingency. Even though the IEEE 24

Bus RTS and ACTIVSg500 do not have that much re-
serve compared to ACTIVSg200, there are still some
optimized networks have better reliability than the orig-
inal network. This observation shows the eﬀectiveness
of using RECO as a guidance to design and expand power
grid network to improve its ability of absorbing sudden
and big disturbances in the system with better reliability.
It also emphasizes the importance of considering reac-
tive consumption and compensation for power network
expansion.

8. Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presents a bio-inspired method for re-
designing power grid networks to improve resilience.
The work reformulates an optimization solution for
larger scale grids with a mixed-integer nonlinear pro-
gramming (MINLP) problem while maintaining the ob-
jective of mimicking food web levels of the ecologi-
cal robustness RECO metric for power systems. Due to
RECO’s complexity, a Taylor Series Expansion is used
to relax its formulation. The relaxed MINLP problem
is applied to four power system cases solved using DC

power ﬂow models. The analysis shows that the bio-
logically optimized networks have improved network
properties and increased reliability under critical con-
tingencies. The optimized networks are better able to
absorb both sudden changes and big disturbances with-
out remedial actions. The results show that the proposed
MINLP problem can improve power systems’ resilience
by strategically constructing networks under the guid-
ance of ecological robustness.

Future work is needed to address three areas high-
lighted for improvement. First, additional relaxation
schemes may need to be investigated for the proposed
MINLP problem to be solved using an AC power ﬂow
model and consider reactive power consumption in new
network structures. Second, additional details should
be added into the cost calculations of new branches to
better understand the economics of the bio-inspired de-
signs. This may include information about location, dis-
tance, time, critical loads, and beneﬁts not only in terms
of fewer contingencies but also added power transfer
capabilities. Third, additional ways to use ecological
robustness should be investigated, including for power
systems operation for redundancy and eﬃciency and for
