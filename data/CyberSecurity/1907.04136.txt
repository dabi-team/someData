Abstract: Owing to the increasing frequency and destruction of natural and manmade disasters to
modern highly-populated societies, emergency management, which provides solutions to prevent
or address disasters, have drawn considerable research over the last few decades and become a
multidisciplinary area. Because of its open and inclusive nature, new technologies always tend to
inﬂuence, change or even revolutionise this research area. Hence, it is imperative to consolidate the
state-of-the-art studies and knowledge to meet the research needs and identify the future research
directions. The paper presents a comprehensive and systemic review of the existing research in the
ﬁeld of emergency management from both the system design aspect and algorithm engineering
aspect. We begin with the history and evolution of the emergency management research. Then
the two main research topics of this area, “emergency navigation” and “emergency search and
rescue planning”, are introduced and discussed. Finally, we suggest the emerging challenges and
opportunities from system optimisation, evacuee behaviour modelling and optimisation, computing
patterns, data analysis, energy and cyber security aspects.

1. Introduction

Emergency management is the creation of plans and strategies for emergency personals and
evacuees to cope with disasters and reduce vulnerability to hazards [1]. Generally, it can be divided
into four aspects, prevention, preparedness, response and recovery (PPRR), which are originated from
the work of US State Governors’ Association in 1978 [2] and have now been widely accepted as the
fundamental components to deal with natural or manmade disasters. The attempts of managing
disasters have been deeply rooted in human history and even folklore owing to the impacts of disasters
to social and economic aspects of societies. Many great disasters have been recorded in ancient
literature such the Bible story of the Deluge.
In the ancient times, the operations of emergency
management were mostly conducted in a unorganised, reactive manner. Until the 20 century, laws
or policies were begun to be passed worldwide to provide ﬁnancial assistance and investment after
or before a disaster strike [3], transforming the operations of emergency management to a more
organised, proactive fashion. From the 1950s, with the nuclear threat during the Cold War as well as
the development of computer technologies, many efforts have been dedicated to computer-aided civil
defense programs [4,5], which motivated the development of the subsequent systematic emergency
management studies. The current research efforts in this area can be generally classiﬁed into two

directions: emergency navigation and emergency search and rescue planning. Emergency navigation,
which is also known as emergency evacuation planning, is the process of directing evacuees out of
hazardous areas with the aid of real-time routing algorithms or pre-deployed static plans that are
based on the prediction and analysis from evacuee behaviour models. Emergency search and rescue
planning, on the other hand, focuses on rescuing immobilised and incapacitated evacuees that are
trapped in hazardous areas with the assistance of task assignment or resource allocation algorithms.
This paper reviews the development and applications of the two main research directions, from both
the system design aspect and algorithm engineering aspect. Owing to its open and inclusive nature,
new technologies always tend to inﬂuence, change or even revolutionise the research area of emergency
management. Hence, the current and emerging challenges are also discussed.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. We ﬁrst summarise the research progress
in the ﬁeld of emergency navigation in Section 2, from the system design aspect in Subsection 2.1
and algorithm engineering aspect in Subsection 2.2; then we review the research efforts related to
emergency search and rescue planning in Section 3, including various systems in Subsection 3.1 and
associated algorithms in Subsection 3.2; next, the research trends and challenges are discussed in
Section 4; ﬁnally, we draw conclusions in Section 5.

2. Emergency Navigation

Nowadays, the research of emergency navigation aims to direct evacuees out of hazardous areas
in a timely and safe manner with the assistance of computer-aided systems. In this section, we ﬁrst
review a series of emergency navigation systems chronologically in Subsection 2.1, then we summarise
various emergency navigation algorithms topic by topic in Subsection 2.2.

2.1. Emergency Navigation Systems

The study of emergency evacuation in conﬁned spaces, which was initially motivated by defence
applications [4,5], has attracted much attention owing to the potential of losses in terms of human
lives and property during a disaster. Accompanying the advancement of computer technologies,
emergency evacuation systems have experienced a few stages: from the original human experience
driven systems, to the currently booming in-situ wireless sensor network based navigation systems,
towards the cloud based navigation systems which are still in their infancy.

Due to limitations in processing power, early emergency navigation systems are commonly
computer-aided information reporting systems to assist emergency managers in making decisions
[6]. Associated emergency navigation algorithms at that time normally used human experience or
purely mathematical models to simplify an evacuation process and seek optimal solutions. Before
1990s, research in this area is very limited. The research in [7] considers the evacuation planning
problem as a minimum cost network ﬂow problem that converts the original building graph to a
time-expanded network; by solving the time-expanded network via a linear programming algorithm,
evacuees can obtain optimal routes and achieve shortest evacuation time. The study in [8] designs a
graph processing software to represent a underground mine as a graph-based evacuation network
in conformity to proper ventilation requirements; each edge is assigned with a weight in terms of
its distance to the source of hazard and fresh air intake, and Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm is
utilised to ﬁnd the safest paths for evacuees. The work in [9] proposes a trafﬁc monitoring and analysis
system to predict the possible trafﬁc jams for emergency planners during urban-scale evacuations;
real-time trafﬁc data are collected at roadside trafﬁc counting stations and transmitted to the system
via conventional telephone lines; an evacuation simulation model is used to provide the locations and
timing of occurrence of potential trafﬁc bottlenecks. The research in [10] presents a human experience
driven emergency alarm system to facilitate emergency authorities to evacuate residents before the
landfall of a hurricane; a “vertical evacuation” methodology is proposed to lower the evacuation
time and the issuing of “early evacuation orders” is believed to be critical in reducing fatalities. To
improve the disaster response ability in accidents at nuclear power plants, the study in [11] proposes

an evacuation plan to ﬂee residents within 20 miles of the plant when a radiation leakage occurs.
The work in [12] designs a real-time emergency monitoring and response system for a nuclear power
plant; the response decisions are based on discussions between experts at off-site emergency response
centers.

With the fast development of information and communications technology (ICT) as well as
the advent of low-costing microelectronic devices, in the middle of 1990s, research moved to the
development of complex Emergency Cyber-Physical-Human systems to direct evacuees to exits with
the aid of an on-site wireless sensor network (WSN). Until today, most of the state-of-the-art emergency
navigation systems and algorithms are still based on static WSNs. For instance, the research in [13]
presents a static WSN based distributed system to compute shortest safe paths for evacuees; this system
employs a two-tiered architecture that contains a sensing sub-system and a decision sub-system. The
study in [14] proposes a static WSN based navigation system to direct evacuees with a variant of
the temporally ordered routing algorithm [15]; initially, exit sensors broadcast “initial packets” to

assign each sensor with an “altitude” that is positively correlated with its distance to the nearest
exit (sensors that are nearer to the exits possess smaller altitudes than those farther sensors); when a
disaster occurs, the altitude of sensors inside a hazardous region will be increased and escape paths
will be generated along sensors with higher altitudes to those with lower altitudes. The work in [16]
utilises a self-organising WSN to guide a robot across a hazardous area; by using an “artiﬁcial potential
ﬁeld” [17], sensors can cooperatively generate a safe path without knowing the network topology.

Compared with static WSNs, mixed WSNs which contain mobile nodes can monitor uncovered
areas of static sensors and is less prone to failures in harsh hazardous environments. Hence, some
research has employed mixed WSNs to build emergency response systems. For instance, the studies
in [18–20] have proposed a resilient emergency support system (ESS) with the aid of opportunistic
communications [21]. This system consists of sensor nodes (SNs) and communication nodes (CNs).
SNs can detect the hazard in its vicinity and inform the evacuees passing by of the location, while CNs
are portable devices that are taken by occupants. The work in [22] presents an indoor autonomous
navigation system composed of an intelligent evacuation sub-system (IES) for primary use and
a opportunistic communication based evacuation sub-system (OCES) for backup purposes; both
sub-systems are supported by pre-installed sensors in the building, the IES utilises static decision
nodes to guide evacuees in proximity while the OCES employs mobile decision nodes carried by
civilians to disseminate emergency messages and direct evacuees when the IDE malfunctions. The
experimental results show that the use of the OCES can considerably reduce the number of fatally
injured civilians during an evacuation process. With the increasing ubiquitousness of smart phones
which provide powerful sensing ability and suffer less from battery power limitations, many studies
have integrated evacuees’ portable devices into emergency navigation systems. For instance, the
study in [23] proposes an emergency support framework that integrates a pre-deployed WSN with the
existing mobile network infrastructure to guide evacuees out of a built environment; the framework,
namely “CoWiSMoN”, employs both ﬁxed sensors pre-installed in the building and mobile phones
carried by evacuees to collect information and send to a quick rescue response center via short-range
wireless communication links or the mobile cellular network; moreover, a cognitive communication
protocol that optimises both the network layer and data link layer is designed to ease the network
congestion caused by the transmission of large volumes of sensory data and the degradation of
communication quality during disasters. Similarly, the research in [24] presents an indoor emergency
evacuation system composed of a sensor-data management sub-system and an indoor navigation
sub-system; the sensor-data management sub-system gathers sensory information and can alert users
and the building manager via mobile phones; the indoor navigation sub-system utilises radio beacon
devices to estimate users’ position; each user carries a beacon receiver that can receive signals from
beacons and transmit to the mobile phone via Bluetooth.

The major drawback of the WSN based emergency navigation systems is the limited computing
capacity, which does not allow them to compute optimal evacuation plans in a timely manner so as to
forward this information to evacuees in the presence of time-varying hazards. Hence, some emergency
navigation systems have integrated cloud computing technologies that are accessible via on-site WSN,
to ofﬂoad intensive computations to remote cloud servers. For instance, the research in [25] proposes
a hazard surveillance system to detect unusual events in an environment and alert residents; the
system is composed of a number of static sensors, several mobile sensors and an external cloud server;
when static sensors detect unusually high temperatures, mobile sensors will be dispatched by the
cloud server to take snapshots and upload to the server for further analysis; if a ﬁre emergency is
conﬁrmed, the cloud server will notify the residents in the vicinity to evacuate. the study in [26]
proposes a multi-cloud based evacuation system that integrates an on-site WSN and remote cloud
servers to calculate evacuation paths for users; when a disaster occurs, the system launches an instance
for each user to compute the desired evacuation route; owing to the limited I/O capability of cloud
providers, several cloud platforms are employed to launch sufﬁcient instances for evacuees and a

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

dynamic programming algorithm is used to minimise the overall latency and service maintenance cost
of the system.

Although the hybrid emergency response systems that integrate on-site WSNs and off-site cloud
servers can avoid the problems caused by the limited computing power of WSNs, the disadvantages
of limited battery life-time of the WSNs, as well as the high likelihood of system malfunction during
an emergency still remain. Hence, many of the studies have replaced WSNs with smart phones carried
by evacuees to build more ﬂexible systems. For example, the work in [27] presents a building ﬁre
evacuation system that consists of radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) sensor tags, mobile phones
with RFID reader and a back-end cloud server; since signals from the global positioning system are
unavailable inside built environments, RFID sensor tags are used to record the temperature and
location information; when a ﬁre breaks out, mobile phones carried by evacuees will periodically sense
the RFID signals and upload to the cloud server; the cloud server will then calculate the shortest safe
route for each civilian with respect to the distance to exit and the summed temperature along the route.
The research in [28] proposes a smart cloud evacuation system (SCES) to post emergency messages
and plans to residents in a built environment; in the front end, a wireless intelligent sensor network
(WISN) that integrates a WSN with smartphones are utilised to collect information; in the back end, a
cloud based decision-making system is used to analyse the uploaded multimedia information (such as
voice, text, images, etc.) and calculate escape paths with a 3D simulator. The study in [29] proposes an
infrastructure-less emergency navigation system to guide evacuees out of hazardous buildings with the
aid of smart phones carried by evacuees and an off-site cloud based decision support system (CDSS);
evacuees can locate themselves by taking a snapshot of pre-deployed landmarks (e.g. door signs) in the
vicinity and uploading it to the CDSS for location identiﬁcation; the CDSS computes congestion-aware
paths with the shortest time to exits for evacuees based on their uploaded locations; evacuees are
guided to exits in loose groups with the assistance of a combination of the social potential ﬁelds
algorithm and a cognitive packet network based algorithm; to reduce the likelihood for the battery
power of smart phones to be drained during the energy-hungry communication among smart phones
and the CDSS, a power-aware communication protocol is also presented to balance the remaining
battery power of smart phones by relaying sensory information via more energy efﬁcient short-range
communication techniques before uploading to the cloud server through 3G.

2.2. Emergency Navigation Algorithms

As the kernel of an emergency navigation system, many studies have concentrated on emergency
navigation algorithms, which aim to guide evacuees out of hazardous areas safely and efﬁciently.
Previous emergency navigation algorithms can be divided into two types: off-line algorithms and
on-line algorithms. Off-line algorithms focus on optimising the design of crowded sites and evaluating
the overall clearance time for all evacuees before a disaster occurs. On the other hand, on-line
algorithms aim to provide evacuation paths for evacuees in a real time manner. The literature review
for the two categories of algorithms is detailed as follows.

2.2.1. Off-line Emergency Navigation Algorithms

Since research has indicated that destructive crowd behaviours, such as clogging, pushing and
trampling, can lead to serious fatalities [30], also owing to the absence of real evacuation data [31],
off-line emergency navigation algorithms have been dedicated to investigate and design crowd
behaviour models [32,33] to simulate the crowd movements in reality and prevent destructive crowd
behaviours from occurring by improving the design of built environments. The crowd behaviour
models of the off-line emergency navigation algorithms can be classiﬁed into cellular automata models
[34–38], social force models [30,39–41], ﬂuid-dynamics models [42,43], lattice gas models [44,45,45,46],
game theoretic models [47–50], computer agents based models [51–54] and animal agent based models
[55,56].

Cellular automata models discretise a given structure into uniform “cells” that each cell can hold
one person. This approach can precisely model the inﬂuence of an individual’s physical dimensions,
but is ineffective in depicting the movement speed and direction, due to the discrete spatial structure
[57]. The physical conditions and the movement patterns of evacuees are normally determined by a
set of local rules at each cell (one drawback is that it is relatively difﬁcult to customise the physical
attributes of each individual civilian). Since this model can effectively mimic the interactions between
the environments and the pedestrians, many studies have utilised this microscopic model to simulate
the pedestrian dynamics during evacuations in the last two decades. In these models, evacuees
are considered as either homogeneous with identical physical attributes (e.g. gender, age, mobility,
psychology) or heterogeneous individuals with different characteristics. For instance, the research in
[58] utilises a homogeneous cellular automata model to investigate the exit dynamics of evacuees in
a room with different number of exits; the arching behaviour, which is a signature of jamming that
happens when the exits are overused, is observed near the exits; a “power law behaviour” is also found:
when the exit door can evacuate more than one evacuee at a time, the evacuees will escape from the
room in bursts of various sizes. In [37] a heterogeneous cellular automata model mimics the evacuation
process in a retirement house; evacuees initially belong to three groups (middle-aged people, nursing
staff and older people), and groups are also formed dynamically due to the follow-the-leader effect. In
[38] grouping behaviours in evacuations are induced by introducing “bosons” into cells of the ﬂoor
ﬁeld cellular automaton [59]; bosons are placed by evacuees as markers to increase the probability
for other group members to reach some particular cells. The resulting simulations indicate that the
evacuation time decreases with the increasing numbers of groups.

The research in [39] ﬁrst proposed that the motion of a crowd of pedestrians are subject to “social
forces”; in the social force model, the motion of a pedestrian is mainly affected by the destination,
the repulsive forces from other objects (e.g. the pedestrian keeps a certain distance away from other
pedestrians or obstacles), the attractive forces from other objects (e.g. the pedestrian is attracted by
friends or window displays); a “direction dependent weight” is introduced into the model since
the objects behind a pedestrian have a weaker effect on the pedestrian; a “ﬂuctuation effect” is also
integrated into the model to simulate the random movement behaviours or deliberate deviations from
usual motion rules. The study in [60] combines the social force model with a counterpropagation neural
network model [61] to mimic crowed behaviours in panic; the personality of evacuees is expressed
as impatient and patient. the velocity and the action of evacuees is determined by the social force
model and the neural network model, respectively; the neural network has four inputs: the personality
of an evacuee, the deviation between the desired speed and real speed, the space on the left side of
the evacuee and the space on the right side of the evacuee; the output of the network is the action
of the evacuee: follow the person in front, evade the front person from the left side and evade the
front person from the right side. The research in [40] utilises the social force model to investigate the
pedestrian evacuation dynamics in a room with an exit; experimental results show that if evacuees
move at the low desired velocities, the faster the evacuees moves, the faster they will evacuate the
room; however, if evacuees move at the high desired velocities, the “faster is slower” effect, that the
faster the evacuees wish to move the slower they can escape from the room, is observed and analysed.

Fluid-dynamics models imitate evacuee ﬂows as ﬂuids to study the density and speed adaptation
during an evacuation process. Compared with microscopic models, the macroscopic ﬂuid-dynamics
models are better at simulating and analysing the behaviours of large crowds. For instance, the research
in [62] derives several equations that govern the motion of a pedestrian ﬂow from the “continuity
equation” of ﬂuid mechanics in physics; the proposed equations lead to two possible regimes of a
pedestrian ﬂow: the fast-moving, low-density “supercritical” ﬂow in which disturbances spread within
the ﬂow and the slow-moving high density “subcritical” ﬂow in which disturbances are swept along by
the ﬂow; several partial differential equations, that govern the crowd behaviours of a ﬂow that contains
different types of pedestrian, are also studied; a pedestrian type is determined by the destination,
walking speed and perception; the analysis and experimental results show that pedestrians tend to
reach each immediate destination in minimum time rather than arriving at all destinations in overall
minimum time. The study in [63] presents a continuum model to investigate the relation between
evacuee density and walking speed during a process of evacuees leaving a corridor through a door;
the proposed model is based on the Lighthill-Whitam [64] and Richards [65] model that is used to
simulate vehicle ﬂows; speciﬁcally, this model describes the decrease in the outﬂow through a door
caused by the panic “overcompression” effect of evacuees in front of the door; the analytical results
indicate that the rise of panic can dramatically decrease the outﬂow of evacuees when the door is
narrow.

Since a pedestrian ﬂow is a many-body system [66] that is composed of strongly interacting
persons, lattice gas models that consider pedestrians as particles on the square lattices have attracted
attention since 1980s. The research in [45] utilises a lattice gas model to simulate the process of a
pedestrian ﬂow evacuating a hall; the hall is represented by square lattices and evacuees are randomly
distributed over the lattices; each evacuee can either hold still or move in four directions: forward,
backward, left and right; evacuees move in the preferential direction with no back step and cannot
overlap on lattices occupied by other evacuees; different dynamical patterns such as arching, ﬂattening
and pitting are observed in computer simulations; experimental results indicate that the dynamical
phase transition from the choking ﬂow to the decaying ﬂow occurs at a critical time. The study in [46]
employs a lattice gas model to study the evacuation time for a crowd to escape from a hall through
a single exit; evacuees are modelled as biased-random walkers and move in preferential directions;
the hall is represented by square lattices and each square lattice may contain up to one evacuee at
a time; the spatio-temporal distribution of evacuation time of evacuees is derived from simulations;
the experimental results show that the evacuation time of an evacuee depends highly on its initial
position within the hall; the effect of the exit width, initial population density and urgency level are
also investigated in the experiments.

To explicitly model the behavioral reactions of the individuals during an evacuation process,
especially the cooperative and competitive behaviours [67], many of the studies have utilised game
theory to mimic the interactive decision-making and strategy-adapting among evacuees. For instance,
the research in [48] employs the non-cooperative game theory [68] to mimic evacuees’ exit selection
process when an emergency occurs in a building with multiply exits; the procedure of the algorithm
consists of two steps; in the ﬁrst step, all evacuees are considered as a “whole entity” which aims at
minimising overall evacuation time while a “virtual entity” is used to maximise the overall evacuation
time by imposing the blockage inﬂuence; hence, a two-player zero sum game is envisaged between the
evacuees and the virtual entity; the optimal strategy is found when a Nash Equilibrium [69] is achieved
via optimising the probabilities for the evacuees to choose each exit and the possibilities for the virtual
entity to pick each exit (to generate congestion); in the second step, the decision of each individual
evacuee is determined by calibrating the evacuees’ probabilistic choices in terms of evacuees’ distance
to exits; this is because, in reality, an evacuee will not pick a farther exit unless the nearer exit is
congested. The study in [50] utilises a game-theoretical model to investigate the competitive and
cooperative behaviours during an evacuation process from a large single room with one exit; During
the evacuation process, when N evacuees wish to occupy the same desired position, the conﬂict among

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

evacuees leads to a N ∗ N game; each evacuee can choose to either compete or cooperate: if all the
evacuees choose to cooperate, then they will all reach the desired position; if all the evacuees are
competitive, they will all be blocked at the initial position; if one evacuee choose to compete and
the rest is in a state of cooperation, only the competitive evacuee can reach the desired position; the
simulation results show that: (1) with the increasing urgency of emergency, the cooperation among
evacuees decreases; (2) higher cooperation frequency will result in shorter overall evacuation time; (3)
the imitation behaviours among evacuees can enhance the cooperation level but reduce the efﬁciency
of the evacuation process.

Algorithms based on pure mathematical models have difﬁculty in fully representing and capturing
the dynamics of an evacuation process. Hence, the agent-based algorithms, which normally represent
a hazardous environment with a number of autonomous decision-making virtual agents, have drawn
considerable attentions in recent years. One major advantage of the agent-based algorithms is the ability
to evolve and learn, which can lead to unanticipated behaviours during simulations. This characteristic
makes the agent-based algorithms a canonical approach to mimic the counterintuitive emergent
phenomena [51]. For instance, the research in [52] utilises a multi-agent framework to simulate a metro
system in the case of a tunnel ﬁre; the passengers and metro personnel, the technological system, as
well as the ﬁre and smoke are simulated by separate agents and co-evolve in an interactive manner;
an effective evacuation plan is designed by varying environmental factors, such as the number of
passengers on the train, the time cost for the train driver to open the doors, etc.; with the aid of
the multi-agent computer simulations which can test different scenarios, the emergency personnel
can quickly customise a rescue plan when a disaster occurs. The study in [54] presents a prototype
multi-agent simulation system that can build a virtual environment with autonomous agents for
safe egress analysis; the proposed system consists of a geometric engine that represent the physical
environment with AutoCAD, a population generator that can produce evacuee agents with diverse
age, mobility, etc., a global database which maintains all the state information of agents; an events
recorder that captures the behaviours of evacuee agents, a visualiser which displays the movement of
evacuees, a crowd simulation engine that is assigned to each evacuee agent to manage the individual
behaviour in terms of the perception-action approach [70]; each evacuee agent is modelled to makes
decisions based on three basic conventions: instinct, experience and bounded rationality [71]; some
emergent behaviours such as competitive, queueing and herding are observed in the simulation.

Owning to the scarcity of human emergent behavioural data and the difﬁculty in conducting
genuine emergency evacuation experiments, the studies of emergent behaviours have largely depended
on simulations. Hence, in recent years, animals have been used in escape panic experiments to study
crowd evacuation. For example, the research in [55] employs mice to study an indoor evacuation
process; mice were released into a rectangular container (simulate a large single room) ﬁlled with tap
water and were left to swim towards a dry platform; an exit is placed between the wet and dry areas to
simulate the door of the single room; the effect of exit width and exit number on the mouse escape rate
is investigated over different experimental sessions, which are recorded with a digital video camera;
the experiments demonstrate some well-known behaviours of panicking crowd: when the exit width
approximately equals to the size of a mouse, the diffusive evacuation ﬂow is observed; when the exit
width becomes larger, the mice evacuate the exit in bursts of different sizes that yield the power-law
distributions depending on the exit width. The work in [56] employs a species of Cuban leafcutter ants
called Atta insularis to investigate the effect of panic-induced herding to an evacuation process from a
two-exit room; ants are introduced into a circular acrylic cell with two exits symmetrically situated
at left and right; in the ﬁrst experiment which simulates a normal evacuation process, when the ants
are placed into the cell, the two exits are opened synchronously so that the ants can escape; in the
second experiment which mimics an emergency evacuation process, the only difference from the ﬁrst
experiment is to inject a dose of insect-repelling liquid to generate a panic before opening the exits;
the experimental results show that ants escape from both exits in approximately equal proportions in
normal conditions but prefer one of the exits in emergency conditions; the experiments demonstrate the

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

theoretical prediction that the herding behaviour in conﬁned spaces can generate a non-symmetrical
use of two identical exit doors; in addition, the observed evacuation dynamics are reproduced with a
computer model inspired by [30].

2.2.2. On-line Emergency Navigation Algorithms

Contrary to off-line emergency navigation algorithms which aim at optimising the design
of crowded sites or generating evacuation plans for facility managers via developing various
crowd behaviour models and computer simulations, on-line emergency navigation concentrates on
combining mathematical models [72] or algorithms [73,74] with underlying sensing, communication
and computational devices to guide evacuees out of hazardous environments in a real time manner.
Since on-line emergency navigation algorithms require real time information exchanges with the
hazardous environment, these algorithms are usually integrated into emergency navigation systems.
With the development of emergency navigation systems which are detailed in 2.1, various emergency
navigation algorithms have been proposed such as network ﬂow based algorithms [7,75–78], geometric
algorithms [79,80], queueing model based algorithms [81–87], potential-maintenance algorithms
[14,16,88], biologically inspired algorithms [89–91], routing protocol based algorithms [19,92–94] and
prediction-based algorithms [95–99].

Network ﬂow based algorithms consider the evacuation planning problem as a minimum cost
network ﬂow problem [100,101]. Commonly, this type of algorithm ﬁrst predicts the upper bound of
the overall evacuation time and then convert the original building model to a time-expanded network
by duplicating the original network for each discrete time unit. After that, linear programming or
heuristic algorithms are utilised to compute the optimal evacuation plan. This type of approach
can achieve the optimal solution but normally does not take the spreading of the hazard into
consideration. For instance, the work in [7] utilises a dynamic network optimisation model to minimise
the overall evacuation time and prevent “bottlenecks” from occurring in a large building; the building
is represented by a graph model composed of nodes and arcs; the capacity of a node is determined
by dividing the space area of the node by the typical space occupied by an evacuee; the capacity
of an arc, which is deﬁned as the maximum number of evacuees that are allowed to traverse the
arc per unit time, is determined by the passageway width; the graph model is expanded into a
time-expanded network by duplicating the original graph model over T time periods, where T is
determined by dividing the approximate evacuation time Te by the length of a time period (10 seconds);
to reduce the computational complexity and ensure the existence of a feasible solution, the minimum
feasible building evacuation time Te is determined by the proposed bisection search algorithm; the
time-expanded network is solved via a large-scale dynamic transshipment algorithm from the GNET
program [102]. Since the search complexity of a time-expanded graph grows exponentially with the
increase of the time bound T, the studies in [103,104] develop a polynomial time algorithm to solve the
evacuation problem with a ﬁxed number of sources and exits; the evacuation problem is converted to
a quickest ﬂow problem, which aims to send a speciﬁc amount of ﬂows from sources to sinks in the
shortest time; the building model is represented by a graph with integral transit times and capacities
on the edges; the evacuees ﬂows are represented by the temporally repeated ﬂows proposed in [100]
rather than static ﬂows in a time-expanded network; the quickest ﬂow problem with multiple sources
and sinks is then transferred to a lexicographic maximum dynamic ﬂow problem and can be solved by
using the algorithms presented in [105] and [106]. Since linear programming algorithms that utilise
time-expanded networks to calculate optimal evacuation plans can suffer from high computational
cost, the work in [77,78] propose a heuristic-based algorithm called capacity constrained route planner
(CCRP) to produce sub-optimal evacuation plans in a time-efﬁcient manner; rather than transforming
the original evacuation network into a time-expanded network, CCRP employs the Dijkstra’s shortest
path algorithm [107] to search only the original evacuation network and calculate the quickest routes
for evacuees; CCRP ﬁrst searches the route with the shortest arrival time from any source node to
any destination node in terms of path length, previous reservations and possible waiting time; then

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

it allocates evacuees to this route with respect to the capacity of the route; the CCRP algorithm will
iterate the above two steps until all the evacuees reach the exits. These approaches can theoretically
solve optimal routes with the shortest time to exits by avoiding congestion. However, to achieve
shortest time to exit, evacuees must accurately follow the suggested paths and reach every node on
schedule and may even wait certain time at a node to avoid congestion. This is impractical in a real
evacuation process. Moreover, these approaches suffer from high computational complexity because
the time-expanded network will contain at least (N + 1)T nodes for a graph with N nodes and an
upper bound of evacuation time T. In addition, as aforementioned, the spreading of the hazard is not
considered in these approaches.

Geometric algorithms normally use a graph model to represent a hazardous environment and
take advantage of the unique properties of geometric graphs to calculate safe egress paths for evacuees.
For instance, the research in [79] adopts the localized Delaunay Triangulation method [108,109] to
partition a wireless sensor network into triangular areas and construct area-to-area egress paths with
the aid of a distributed navigation protocol; each sensor, which is the shared vertex of all the adjacent
triangles, maintains the node ID, hops to the exits and the sensed hazard level (temperature) of
the neighbour sensors; the direction of an egress path is generated from vertices with larger hop
count to the exit to vertices with smaller hop count; the safety level of a triangle area is classiﬁed
into three color-coded levels (red “high”, yellow “moderate” and green “low”) by comparing the
average detected temperature of the associated sensors with a pre-set temperature threshold; in built
environments with multiple-exits, additional wireless access points (AP) that can cover the whole
environment are deployed in the vicinity of each exit to count the number of evacuees nearby, a
load-dispersion algorithm is employed to distribute evacuees by limiting the number of users per exit.
The research in [80] proposes a WSN based emergency navigation system to guide evacuees without
the aid of any pre-knowledge of sensor or user locations; the process of navigating evacuees to the
exit contains three stage: ﬁrstly, a road map is generated as the backbone route; secondly, the exit is
connected to the backbone route via a virtual power ﬁeld algorithm; thirdly, evacuees are directed to
the backbone route via the virtual power ﬁeld algorithm and then follow the backbone route all the
way to the exit; the road map is constructed via concatenating the medial axis of the boundary of any
two safe areas; as is proven in [110], the medial axes of the safe regions, which can form continuous
curve graphs, retain the topological and geometric features of the safe areas; in the virtual power ﬁeld
algorithm, the virtual power of a point is inversely proportional to its distance from the hazard; the
route from any point to the backbone route will follow the most descending direction of the virtual
power ﬁeld; owing to the expanding or shrinking of the hazard, the dangerous areas vary during the
evacuation process; hence, a local road map updating algorithm is proposed to rebuild the backbone
route of the affected areas instead of reconstructing the entire backbone route when a variation of
the dangerous areas is detected. However, the effectiveness of these approaches highly depends
on the topology of the deployed wireless sensor network. The change of the topology will induce
redeployment and re-calibration of these algorithms.

Owing to the stochastic, highly transient and nonlinear nature of an evacuation process, queueing
models have been proven as a useful tool to capture and analyse the dynamics of evacuees. Normally,
by treating signiﬁcant locations such as doorways or staircases as “servers”, queueing model based
approaches [111], which generalise the Markovian models of computer systems [112], transfer building
graphs to a queueing network or a number of isolated “queues” to estimate congestion and evacuation
delays. For instance, the process of pedestrians traversing a corridor or stairwell is analysed as a
state-dependent process in [81], a M/G/C/C state-dependent queue model is utilised to estimate the
congestion delays at corridors or stairwells and the overall evacuation time of an evacuation process;
the pedestrian ﬂows are classiﬁed into three categories: uni-directional ﬂow, bi-directional ﬂow and
multi-directional ﬂow; the relationship between the crowd density and the mean walking velocity of
evacuees in the three categories of pedestrian ﬂows are derived from [113]; the capacity of a corridor or
stairwell is calculated based on [114], which indicates that the evacuee ﬂow will cease to move when

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

11 of 33

the population density reaches 5 evacuees per square meter; the state-dependent service rate of the
three categories of pedestrian ﬂows can be calculated in terms of the mean walking speed and the
corridor capacity; ﬁnally, the time cost for an evacuee ﬂow to traverse a corridor or a stairwell can be
computed by the mean value analysis (MVA) algorithm introduced in [115]. To ensure no corridors will
be block during an evacuation process in a built environment, the work in [82] considers the evacuation
planning problem as a service and capacity allocation (SCA) problem and searches the smallest capacity
of each corridor via modelling the building as a M/G/c/c queueing network; the M/G/c/c queueing
network is employed to calculate the average queue length at each corridor with the following steps:
(1) the average walking speed Vn of n evacuees in a corridor is calculated by the equations derived
from the congestion model proposed in [116], (2) the state-dependent service rate f (n) with n evacuees
in a corridor can be computed by f (n) = Vn
, where V1 is the average speed of a lone evacuee, (3) term
V1
pn, which is the probability of n evacuees in a corridor can be calculated by the equations derived
from [117], (4) the average queue length of a corridor can then be computed by L = ∑c
n=1 npn; to
analyse the smallest capacity of each individual corridor, the generalised expansion method [118,119]
is used to expand the M/G/c/c queueing network into an equivalent Jackson network via adding an
artiﬁcial holding node in front of each ﬁnite queue to register the blocked evacuees due to capacity
limitation; After decomposing the queueing network, a local search algorithm inspired by [120] is
used to search the smallest feasible capacity of each queue. Similarly, the studies in [84,121] utilise
a M/G/c/c queue model to simulate the dynamics and predict the overall evacuation time of an
egress process without hazard; rooms, corridors and stairways are modelled as queues in which the
service rate depends on the evacuee density; doors, exits and gateways are imitated as queues in
which the service rate depends on not only the evacuee density, but also the faster-is-slower effect [122]
and the crowd impatience [123]; to validate the effectiveness of the queue system, a discrete-event
simulation model is implemented via the SimEvents toolbox in the MATLAB/Simulink environment
and experimental results show that the egress time of evacuees in simulations highly matches with
the prediction of the proposed queueing model. Rather than simulating all the building components
as M/G/c/c queues, the research in [124] models doorways that can pass one person at a time as
M/M/1 queues; on the other hand, corridors or stairs are modelled as M/G/∞ queues, in which
the inﬁnite number of servers imply that no congestion occurs in corridors or stairs. Rather than
using traditional closed network models which suffer from high computational costs, the study in [85]
proposes a computationally efﬁcient open network model with product form to predict the congestion
level at each point of interest (PoI) and the overall evacuation time with respect to average arrival and
departure rates at each observation point; By assuming Poisson arrivals of evacuees at each originating
location, uni-directional corridors that allow at most one evacuee to pass at a time and exponentially
traversal delays at each corridor, a M/M/1 queue model is established to mimic each corridor; hence,
the average delay at a corridor can be calculated by 1
µ represents the average traversal time
of a corridor and λ represents the average arrival rate of evacuees at a corridor; the average traversal
time of a path can be calculated by summing the average delay of each corridor on it. Rather than
considering each signiﬁcant location (such as a doorway or staircase) as an independent “queue” and
then use either the limiting probabilities for the number of customers in an M/G/C/C state-dependent
queueing model [125] or steady-state solutions [85] to analyse the number of evacuees at the location,
the work in [86] treats all the signiﬁcant locations in the designated area as a “queueing network” by
considering the interaction effects of various evacuees among linked “queues”; in this study, to predict
the time cost T for an evacuee to traverse a path, a G-network model [126] is employed to periodically
compute the utilisation rate of each node and edge under the combined impact of a speciﬁc routing
scheme and panic behaviours; Little’s formula is then used to calculate the average delay of each node
and edge; ﬁnally, T can be calculated by summing the average latency of each node and edge on it.
The research in [87] proposes an urban scale emergency navigation system to guide vehicles to safe
zones in the aftermath of a disaster in a latency and energy efﬁcient manner; a G-network model [127]
is utilised to analyse and capture the dynamics of vehicles under the joint inﬂuence of interactions

µ−λ , where 1

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

12 of 33

among individual vehicles and the re-routing decisions from the navigation system; by using this
G-network model, the average number of vehicles and the average traversal time at each intersection
or road segment can be calculated; hence, the total average delay experienced by a vehicle and the
total fuel consumption in the network can be described by a goal function; ﬁnally, a gradient descent
algorithm is utilised to reduce the time and fuel cost (minimise the goal function) by optimising the
probabilistic choices of linked road segments at each intersection.

Potential based algorithms normally can dynamically develop navigation paths by assigning
attractive or repulsive potentials to the exits and hazards, and the evacuees move as a result of the net
attraction-repulsion in various directions. For instance, the research in [16] presents a self-organizing
sensor network to guide users such as robots, evacuees or unmanned vehicles out of a hazardous
environment along safest paths by using the “artiﬁcial potential ﬁelds” algorithm [17]: when a sensor
detects hazard, it will broadcast emergent messages including sensor ID, number of hops to the arrived
sensor (Nh) to other sensors; when a sensor receives multiple emergent messages from the same
hazardous sensor, it will keep the smallest Nh; the potential value of a sensor generated by a hazardous
sensor is calculated by 1
; hence, the overall potential value of the sensor is computed by summing
N2
h

the potential value generated by each hazardous sensor; in this way, an attractive force is generated by
the destination to pull the user while repulsive forces are generated by the dangerous zones to push
the user away from them; the safest path is generated by following the most descending direction of
the potential ﬁeld; experiments are conducted on a testbed with 50 Mote MOT300 sensors [128] and
the results indicate that the algorithm could successfully direct the objects to the destination; however,
multiple destinations may have a negative impact on the efﬁciency of reaching the exits as the users
move under the actuation of artiﬁcial forces; Moreover, the convergence time for network stabilization
is relatively long due to the effect of data loss, asymmetric connection and network congestion. The
study in [14] proposes a temporally ordered routing algorithm [15] based multi-path routing protocol
to route evacuees to exits through safest paths; a navigation map is manually deﬁned during the
deployment process to avoid impractical paths; in the initialisation phase, each sensor is assigned
with an altitude with respect to its hops to the nearest exit: sensors nearer to the exits are assigned
with smaller altitudes while sensor farther from the exits are allocated with larger altitudes; when an
emergency event is detected, a sensor si within the hazardous regions will update their altitudes by
A(cid:48)(si) = max(cid:8)A(si), Aemg × 1
(cid:9), where A(cid:48)(si) and A(si) represent the altitude of sensor si
h2
si ,sh
before and after update; term Aemg is a large constant, term hsi,sh represents the shortest hop distance
between sensor si and the hazardous sensor sh while term hsi,se represents the shortest hop distance
between sensor si and the exit se; a hazardous region is constructed by sensors within a predeﬁned hop
distance from the hazardous sensor; egress routes are generated from sensors with higher altitudes to
senors with lower altitudes; therefore, the update of altitudes of hazardous sensors can ensure evacuees
bypass the hazardous regions. The work in [129] extends the algorithm in [14] to a 3D environment
and divides the sensors into normal sensors, exit sensors and stair sensors in terms of location; if no
available path to exits can be discovered, evacuees will be directed to rooftops and wait for rescue.
However, multiple destinations (exits) may affect the efﬁciency of reaching the exits as the users move
under the actuation of artiﬁcial forces. Moreover, the convergence time for network stabilization
is relatively long due to the effect of the information synchronization, asymmetric connection and
network congestion.

Millions of years of evolution has made the animal foraging behaviours become near-optimal
solutions of autonomous search and path-ﬁnding [130], biologically inspired approaches, which are
inspired by simple but reliable natural mechanisms, employ heuristics to search optimal routes in a
computationally efﬁcient manner. For instance, a feed-forward neural network model is adopted to
a wireless sensor-actuator network (WSAN) for evacuation routing in [90]; all physical nodes in the
WSAN deploy a neural network with identical topology: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output
layer; the input layer receives the latest two coordinates of a pedestrian and a suggested direction is
subsequently generated by the output layer; the neural networks are trained with a back-propagation

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

algorithm [131] in standard situations and are deactivated when an emergency happens; hence
evacuees will be directed to exits over their normal walking paths; however, back-propagation
algorithms suffer from slow learning rate and easily converging to local minimum; furthermore,
this model cannot react to the spreading of a hazard. The study in [91] employs a genetic algorithm
[132] to minimise the total evacuation time, travel distance and number of congestion encountered
during an evacuation process; non-domination sorting [133] is used as no priori knowledge is available
to determine the weight of the three goals; the initial “chromosomes” are paths found by the k-th
shortest path algorithm [134] and are incrementally evolved to feasible solutions through crossover
and mutation with respect to the path length, congestion level and hazard intensity; as an evolutionary
approach, this algorithm has advantages in solving multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) [135];
however, the computational overhead is relatively high due to the path-ﬁnding and the evolution
process. The research in [136] adopts a variation of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to search
routes and adjust velocity during evacuations; occupants are viewed as particles to search exits; once
an exit is discovered, all the other particles will move towards it while keep their moving inertia
to expand searching space; if more than one exit is found, particles will choose the nearest exit
as the destination; nevertheless, use occupants directly to explore paths may cause severe injuries
and fatalities; meanwhile, this algorithm may induce seriously congestion and oscillation problems.
Inspired by the bee colony foraging behaviour, the work in [137] uses bee colony optimization [138]
to displace evacuees in hazardous areas to safe areas during an emergency evacuation; hives, food
sources and bees represent safe areas, hazardous areas and evacuees, respectively; evacuees select
a safe area with regard to “attractiveness” which is determined by the distance to the area and the
distribution of people in hazardous areas; once an evacuee determines a target, it will recruit other
evacuees by sharing information of the devoted area; this algorithm obtains a robust evacuation plan
at the expense of relatively high communication overhead.

Since many of the current emergency response systems are based on wireless sensor networks,
routing protocols that are initially used for packet networks have been borrowed or adapted to direct
evacuees and improve communication quality in hazardous environments. For instance, the research
in [92] presents an emergency support system built on top of a WSN to guide evacuees out of a
conﬁned space in a real time fashion; the embedded emergency navigation algorithm is inspired by
the Cognitive Packet Network routing protocol [139,140], which was initially designed for large-scale
packet networks; different from the original CPN that contains three types of packets: smart packets
(SPs), dumb packets (DPs) and acknowledgements (ACKs), the variant only consists of SPs and
ACKs; SPs are sent from each sensor nodes in the WSN to search egress paths and collect hazard
information in a distribute manner with their predeﬁned goals; when a SP reaches an exit, which
means an egress path has been discovered, an ACK will be generated and bring back the ID and the
hazard information of each sensor node along the path to the source node that emits the SP; when
the ACK reaches the source node, it will update the QoS level of the discovered path by using a
rolling average mechanism, which sums the newly discovered QoS and previously stored value in
a weighted manner; in attempting to efﬁciently ﬁnd the route with the best quality of service (QoS),
when a SP arrives at a sensor node, it will decide its next hop by m-Sensible routing algorithm [141];
a QoS metric is deﬁned as sensitive if its value is affected by the trafﬁc through the path, such as
congestion level; on the other hand, a QoS metric is insensitive if its value is independent on the
trafﬁc assigned to the path, such as path length or number of hops on a path; m-Sensible routing
algorithm calculates the probabilistic choices of all the neighbour nodes based on the QoS information
brought back by the previous SPs; hence, future SPs decide their next hop by yielding the probabilistic
choices of the neighbour nodes obtained by the m-sensible policy; the probability of choosing a
E[L(nπ(u),nπ(j),nπ(e),π)]−m
i=1 E[L(nπ(u),nπ(i),nπ(e),π)]−m , where L(nπ(u), nπ(j), nπ(e), π) represents
the effective length of a path π from source node nπ(u) via a neighbour node nπ(j) to the exit node
nπ(e); term E[L(nπ(u), nπ(j), nπ(e), π)] represents the expectation of L(nπ(u), nπ(j), nπ(e), π); term Nn
represents the number of neighbour nodes of the node nπ(u); it is proved in [141] that the QoS increases

neighbour node is determined by

∑Nn

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

14 of 33

with the increase of term m, hence, an m + 1-sensible routing policy provides better QoS on the average
than the m-sensible policy; to enhance the stabilisation of network, a predeﬁned “measurement discard
threshold” is set to discard the reported QoS (effective length) that is smaller than the threshold. Since
communications which are essential in an evacuation process can easily malfunction due to the hazard,
the research in [19] proposes a resilient emergency support system (ESS) to disseminate emergency
messages among evacuees and direct evacuees out of a conﬁned space with the aid of opportunistic
communications (Oppcomms); the proposed system is composed of pre-deployed sensor nodes (SNs)
to collect environmental information and mobile communication nodes (CNs) which are portable
devices carried by evacuees; to locate evacuees, each SN contains a location tag and can periodically
send a location message (LM) to CNs in proximity; when a SN detects a hazard, an emergency message
(EM) will be generated and broadcast to CNs carried by evacuees in vicinity by using the epidemic
routing [142]; the EM will be stored in these CNs and forwarded to other CNs in contact by the
“store-carry-forward” paradigm [21] during the movement of the evacuees; to guide evacuees, each
CN stores the building graph in its local storage and updates the edge costs when receiving an EM; the
Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm is triggered to calculate the shortest safest path when the graph is
updated; experimental results indicate that the proposed system is robust to network failures during an
emergency; since Oppcomms are susceptible to malicious attacks such as ﬂooding or denial of service,
an extended study [143] proposes a defence mechanism that uses a combination of identity-based
signatures (IBS) and content-based message veriﬁcation to detect malicious nodes. However, network
routing protocol based algorithms normally make decisions based on the collected sensory information
rather than the predicted situation of a path. Therefore, when evacuees traverse that path, the situation
could have changed owing to the highly dynamic nature of an evacuation process, which normally
induces a delayed feedback loop between living sensory data and routing decisions. Similar to [92],
the research in [93] also borrows the concept of the cognitive packet network to calculate evacuation
paths for evacuees with the aid of an on-site WSN in a distributed manner; however, rather than using
m-Sensible routing algorithm, the random neural network (RNN) algorithm [144] is utilised as the
decision-making algorithm for the SPs to explore the environment; each sensor node in the WSN is
considered as a CPN node, in which a RNN is deployed to direct the passing-by SPs and a mailbox
is used to store the discovered paths and the associated QoS measurements; the RNN consists of
neurons that are associated with each potential forwarding direction of SPs; each neuron possesses
an excitation probability to indicate the quality of the forwarding direction, and the neuron with the
highest excitation probability corresponds to the optimal forwarding direction; when an evacuation
process begins, CPN nodes continuously sends out SPs or relays SPs from other CPN nodes; when a
SP reaches a CPN node, it can either select the forwarding direction corresponding to the most excited
neuron or drift randomly to search new routes; as a SP arrives at an exit, an ACK will be generated
to backtrack the discovered route in a loop-free manner; when an ACK reaches a CPN node, the
training process of the local RNN will be triggered and the excitation probability of each neuron will
be updated based on the learning mechanism of the RNN; the discovered routes will be stored in the
local mailbox and sorted by quality; evacuees in the vicinity of a senor node always will be transferred
the top-ranked route as their evacuation route; since each SP can gain “experience” from previous
SPs, the CPN can rapidly discover the optimal or near-optimal evacuation routes by emitting very few
packets [145]. The studies in [94,146] extends the work in [93] and makes use of the feature of CPN
to develop a multi-path routing algorithm for different categories of evacuees (prime-aged people,
aged people, children or ill people, and disabled people in electric powered wheelchairs) with respect
to their speciﬁc requirements; since each SP can search a distinct path based on its pre-deﬁned goal
function, during the evacuation process, various types of SPs are sent out to search distance-orient
paths, time-orient paths, safety-oriented paths and energy-efﬁciency oriented paths for the associated
evacuees. On top of the work in [146], The work in [147] designs a cooperative strategy that divides
evacuees into health-oriented evacuees and evacuation-time-oriented evacuees, and can adjust the
routing strategy of evacuees when their “virtual health value” fulﬁlls a certain condition; the use of

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

the strategy is proven to be more sensitive and adaptive to sudden changes in the hazard environment
such as abrupt congestion or injury of civilians.

By inferring the spreading rate and direction of the hazards, prediction-based algorithms predict
the future status in the hazardous areas and reduce the fatality rate by avoid evacuees from traversing
paths with high potential risk level. For instance, the research in [95] proposes a Monte-Carlo stochastic
model to predict the spreading of the ﬁre hazard and the movement of evacuees during an evacuation
process; the targeted building is represented by two graph models composed of nodes (compartments)
and edges (passageways), one for ﬁre spread modelling and the other for occupant egress modelling;
a discrete hazard function based on Bernoulli trials is used to mimic the propagation of the ﬁre; a
Bernoulli trial, which is a random experiment with two possible results: “success” and “failure”, and
the probability of success or failure is constant whenever the experiment is conducted, is performed
at each time step to mimic the transmission of ﬁre from a compartment to another; each edge of the
two graph models is associated with a “defective” random variable to represent the time cost for
evacuees or the ﬁre hazard to traverse this edge; these defective random variables, which take the
value “inﬁnity” with non-zero probability, are used to simulate the phenomena such as evacuees
cannot reach the next node owing to the capacity limitation or ﬁre cannot reach the next node due to
ﬁre ﬁghting activities. The study in [96] proposes a WSN based distributed navigation algorithm to
search safest routes for evacuees by maximising the time an evacuee will remain ahead of the hazard
while traversing the route; each sensor will maintain two weighted graphs of the built environment,
a “hazard graph” and a “navigation graph”; in the hazard graph, nodes represent the locations of
sensor while edges represent the possible movement directions of the hazard (for example, hazard may
spread through walls or along corridors); the weight of an edge is the shortest time for the hazard to
propagate along the edge, these information can be obtained from off-line hazard simulations [148] or
estimated by emergency engineers; in the navigation graph, nodes represent the sensor locations while
edges represent the possible movement directions of evacuees; the weight of an edge is the longest
time for an evacuee to traverse the edge; when a ﬁre breaks out, sensors that detect the hazard will
broadcast the ﬁre source location over the senor network, then each sensor calculates the safest path to
exit by maximising the overall difference in time between an evacuee arriving each node on a path and
the hazard reaching these nodes. Since it is difﬁcult for ﬁre-ﬁghters to be aware of the actual conditions
in a built environment during a ﬁre disaster, the research in [97] presents a novel e-infrastructure to
infer the spreading of hazard based on predictive models and living sensory data in a faster-than-real
time manner; the system consists of on-site sensors including smoke detectors and temperature
sensors, and off-site computational models that are deployed on High Performance Computing (HPC)
resources; gathered sensory data is used as inputs into a Monte-Carlo fashion ﬁre spread model
called K-CRISP [149] to prediction the movement of ﬁre and smoke; the results are interpreted by
using a knowledge-based reasoning scheme within an agent-based command-and-control layer; the
outputs are transmitted to ﬁre-ﬁghters for reference. To deal with the highly uncertainties during an
evacuation process in an unfamiliar built environment, the work in [98] proposes a Dynamic Bayesian
network (DBN) [150] based spatio-temporal probabilistic model to capture the uncertain nature of the
hazard and crowd dynamics, and forecast the movement of evacuees; the integrated hazard and crowd
evacuation DBN model is composed of a hazard model, a risk model, a behaviour model, a ﬂow model
and a crowd model; each model embeds a DBN and is subject to the Markov condition; by using the
integrated hazard and crowd evacuation DBN model, the relations between the location of evacuees
and the hazard status of each location (dormant, growing, developed, decaying and burnt-out) are
tracked and predicted over adjacent time steps; hence, the probabilistic risk level of each location can
be derived from the model; the egress paths are calculated by Dijkstra’s algorithm with respect to the
estimated risk level of each location with the purpose of minimising the overall fatality rate. These
algorithms are developed in recent years and are quite promising owing to the increasing popularity
and tremendous computing power of the cloud computing paradigm. Since the performance of many
emergency navigation algorithms is sensitive to various initial conditions (e.g. the initial distribution

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

16 of 33

of evacuees, congestion level, type of disaster and initial disaster location) and the choice of certain
parameters, the research in [99] presents a faster-than-real-time simulation based routing algorithm
to predict the future situation before guiding evacuees to exits when a disaster breaks out; instead of
guiding evacuees in a real time manner, this algorithm borrows the tremendous computational power
of the cloud based simulator to rapidly identify the potential death victims by predicting the future
movements of evacuees and spreading of the hazard; then, an iterative based algorithm is employed
to gradually search appropriate paths for these potential death victims; ﬁnally, all the calculated paths
are sent to evacuees for instruction and evacuees could follow the paths in source routed manner (do
not need to switch paths during the evacuation process).

3. Emergency Search and Rescue Planning

Originating from maritime search and rescue operations, search and rescue planning in emergency
situations has motivated considerable research over the last several decades owing to the unfortunate
increasing threat of both manmade and natural disasters. During a disaster-related emergency
evacuation, evacuees may become immobilised and incapacitated due to injuries or obstacle contact.
Therefore, to reduce the fatalities, various emergency management systems have been proposed to
detect the location of incapacitated evacuees and dispatch rescuers to perform rescue operations. The
main challenges of a rescue operation are threefold. The ﬁrst challenge is how to efﬁciently search and
locate injured evacuees or other objects in unknown environments, especially on how to coordinate
the activities among various rescuers. The second is to design an appropriate rescuer assignment
algorithm to allocate rescuers to injured evacuees in a real time and computationally efﬁcient fashion
under the highly dynamic hazardous environment. This is actually a NP-hard assignment problem
[151], which aims to minimise the overall potential cost for the rescue operation. The third challenge is
to search desired paths for rescuers and victims to fulﬁl their speciﬁc requirements, which is difﬁcult
since the “quality” of a path is affected by the spreading of the hazard, the dynamic congestion
level, the movements and behaviours of evacuees and other rescuers on the path. In the following
subsections, we will summarise various systems and algorithms that have been proposed to meet the
aforementioned challenges.

3.1. Emergency Search and Rescue Planning Systems

Based on the facilities used, emergency search and rescue planning systems can be divided into
two categories, wearable computing-assisted rescue systems and search & rescue robotic systems.
Wearable computing-assisted rescue systems concentrate on providing various enhancements for
emergency personnel (e.g. ﬁreﬁghters, rescuers) with the aid of wearable devices to increase the
efﬁciency of rescue operations and improve the safety of emergency responders. On the other hand,
disasters that create harsh environments with extreme temperature, toxic substances or various
obstacles have exposed the unsafety and inefﬁciency of the human-centered search and rescue planning
systems. These limitations have therefore inspired the development of the robot-centered search and
rescue planning systems, which employ various mobile robots to conduct rescue operations.

3.1.1. Wearable Computing-assisted Rescue Systems

With the rising interest in body-centric wireless communications, which has also been
standardised as a part of the fourth generation mobile communication systems (4G) [152], considerable
research has been dedicated to develop low cost, light-weight wearable antennas to maintain and
improve emergency communications. The work in [153] implements an electrically-small wearable
antenna, which is integrated into the sleeve of a jacket, to monitor the positions of emergency rescuers;
the designed frequency is at around 860 MHz since higher frequencies could suffer from shadowing
caused by obstacles; the antenna consists of an electromagnetically coupled square patch and a
central shorting pin; to reduce the cost and weight of the antenna, various conductive textiles such
as mixed cotton-steel threads are employed and tested as the material for both the patches and

the ground plane. The research in [154] designs a wearable antenna integrated with the existing
Cospas-Sarsat, a satellite-based search and rescue system that provides distress alert detection and
information distribution services by locating and communicating with activated personal locator
beacons, to provide emergency alert and location information for maritime rescue teams. The antenna
is embedded into a life vest, and the moisture-absorption characteristics of the textile can affect the
anntenna’s performance. The textile material used must be evaluated for “Moisture regain”, i.e. their
moisture-absorption rate, measured by the relative weight increase when kept in a high-humidity
environment, and the antenna is placed on a foam substrate with low moisture-absorption rate, a thin
carrier foil with an inkjet-printed antenna pattern, and a cover fabric to protect the antenna from wear
and tear, and from water inﬁltration.

The study in [155] presents an emergency rescue navigation system to direct ﬁremen to “key
corridors” to eliminate ﬁre and congestion caused by evacuees or obstacles generated from hazard.
The rescue navigation system is composed of a remote control center to generate instructions for
ﬁreﬁghters, an on-site WSN to provide hazard & location information, as well as 802.15.4 compatible
personal digital assistants (PDAs) carried by ﬁreﬁghters to communicate with the control center and
the WSN via naive ﬂooding or the opportunistic ﬂooding strategy. To determine the “key corridors”
that affects the efﬁciency of the evacuation most, this problem is ﬁrstly converted to a “maximum ﬂow
problem” by connecting each normal node (represent the location of a sensor) with a virtual source and
each exit with a virtual sink; the edges that can maximise the amount of ﬂow passing from the source
to the sink are then determined by the Max-ﬂow Min-cut theorem; ﬁnally, a breadth-ﬁrst-search strategy
is used to search the key corridors with existing hazard or obstacles from the afore-determined edges.
The research in [156] presents a wearable sensor-based search and rescue system, namely “CenWits”,
to locate lost or injured hikers in wilderness areas with an opportunistic relaying scheme; each hiker
carries a wearable sensor with a built-in GPS receiver that can provide position information and an
integrated RF transceiver to exchange “witness information“ (movement and location information)
with other hikers in vicinity; to maintain the communication between hikers and the rescue center,

access points (APs) are deployed at locations of interest that hikers are likely to pass through, and
convey the witness information stored in the wearable sensors to the rescue center; due to the limited
battery power and memory of wearable sensors, CenWits also provides an adaptive data storage
strategy to optimise the trade-off between battery power and memory utilisation with the aid of a
dynamic grouping and partitioning mechanism; if the remaining battery power of wearable sensors is
low, hikers are partitioned into groups where only the group leaders store all witness information and
communicate with the APs while the rest of group members are set to sleep mode; if the remaining
battery power of wearable sensors is sufﬁcient while the remaining memory is running low, hiker
groups are further divided into sub-groups where each group member stores a subset of the witness
information.

As an effort to decrease the likelihood of emergency events from the “prevention” aspect,
the research in [157] presents a wearable personal healthcare and emergency aid system, namely
“WAITER”, to monitor the health status of users with wearable vital signal sensors and alert the remote
healthcare center when an emergency occurs; aiming at substituting the labour-intensive caregiver
aid, this system comprises of a body-worn vital signal sensor to collect health status data, a mobile
phone to perform on-site computation and storage operations for the raw data and a remote healthcare
center to provide timely medical aid; the vital signal sensor is integrated into a Bluetooth ear-set which
consists of a heart beat sensor, a motion sensor, a body temperature sensor and a Bluetooth wireless
communication device; since the high energy consumption of the wireless data transmission, raw data
gathered by the vital signal sensor is ﬁrst transmitted to the mobile phone for reﬁning and validation
via the Bluetooth transceiver; once an emergency is detected, the mobile phone generates an alert with
the ﬁltered data and then sends to the healthcare center via its GSM module.

Owing to the superior performance of animal agents during search and rescue operations in terms
of mobility, energy utilisation efﬁciency, sensory acuity and intrinsic cognitive capacity, much effort
has been dedicated to animal agent assisted search and rescue systems. The research in [158] employs
cyber-enhanced working dogs to locate and reach survivors trapped under rubble in the aftermath of
large-scale disasters; this system contains three components: a smart harness worn by a working dog
to monitor the surrounding environment and the canine, a remote computer carried by the handler
to analyse and control the behaviours of the canine, and mobile base stations such as unmanned
vehicles to maintain the communication between the working dog and the handler; the smart harness
is equipped with various sensors and actuators, including DC vibration motors to receive haptic
commands, a mini-speaker to issue aural commands, a treat dispenser to reward the canine for desired
actions, accelerometers and gyroscopes to monitor the posture of the working dog, as well as a GPS
receiver, microphones and cameras to gather environmental information; on the other hand, the remote
computer is employed to identify the posture and behaviours of the canine remotely, the activities
of a canine are classiﬁed into 5 static postures (sitting, standing, lying down, standing on two legs,
and eating off the ground) and 3 dynamic behaviours (walking, climbing stairs, and walking down
ramps), three hidden Markov models, which are each associated with one of the dynamic behaviours,
are utilised to classify the dynamic behaviours of a working dog; the starting state probabilities and
transition probabilities of the hidden Markov models are estimated with the iterative Baum-Welch
algorithm; the input sensory data that cannot be categorised into the 3 dynamic behaviours will be
reﬁned with a moving average ﬁlter and then identiﬁed as a static posture. In attempting to penetrate
the voids and narrow gaps under the collapsed ruins after an major earthquake, the study in [159]
employs cockroaches to search trapped survivors and map the under-rubble environment; to instruct
the locomotory behaviours of a cockroach, ﬁne wire electrodes are implanted into the antennae of
the cockroach to perform neurostimulation-based locomotion control; the searching strategy of this
system is to keep each cockroach moving and exploring naturally within a deﬁned area; when the
cockroach reaches the boundary of the area, left-turn or right-turn commands will be sent from in the
form of neurostimulation pulses via the ﬁne wire electrodes; each cockroach is also mounted with
three directional microphones to locate the survivors by using the “received signal strength indicator”

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

19 of 33

and the ultrasonic ranging technologies; to construct a robustness map of the environment, a novel
topological mapping approach is used to ﬁrst extract topological features from encounters among the
cockroaches, and then reﬁne the persistent features from the generated encounter map.

3.1.2. Search and Rescue Robotic Systems

Since the human access to the victims in the aftermath of a disaster such as an earthquake or
radioactive leakage can be time consuming and may induce further casualties [160], the use of robots
that can be released rapidly to locate and rescue victims has drawn considerable attention in recent
decades, and has gradually become a research domain after the Great Hanshin earthquake and the
Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 [161]. Nowadays, research on “search and rescue robotic systems”
has evolved as a major branch of “search and rescue”, especially for urban scale structural collapse
environments [162]. According to the different operating environments, search and rescue robots
can be divided into autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and urban search and rescue (USAR)
vehicles [163], which contain various types of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs). This literature review focuses on the research of USAR robotic systems, and
the research on AUVs is excluded due to its distinctive emphases caused by the turbid underwater
environment.

Due to the limitations on the mobility (tracks, wheels or combination of both) and intelligence,
most of the current search and rescue robot systems are not advanced enough for fully autonomous
operations. Hence, a research direction is to investigate the human-robot interaction during search
and rescue operations. The ﬁrst known use of USAR robots for an actual unstaged rescue mission
occurs during the World Trade Center collapse [164], when various models of tele-operated robots
from industry, military and academia were invited to assist the rescue operation; these robots carried
various sensors such as cameras, microphones and speakers to provide real time video and audio
for remote human operators for victim identiﬁcation, and various actuators such as a robot arm with
a gripper attached topside for victim extrication, a medical tube for providing fresh air or water;
moreover, this work conducts a post-hoc analysis on the performance of the human-robot interaction
during the rescue mission based on the video tape and ﬁeld notes; the analysis reveals the pressing
needs of improving the mobility, intelligence and assistive interfaces of rescue robots, as well as
reducing the number of people needed to operate a robot since the performance of operators are
signiﬁcantly affected by cognitive fatigue caused by lack of sleep. The research in [165] presents a
semi-autonomous robot controller to share and co-execute tasks with remote human operators during
the exploration of unknown disaster scenes; instead of using fully human-supervised robotic control
which may induce cognitive and physical fatigue, disorientation and incorrect judgements, a MAXQ
hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) based controller is developed in this study to determine
whether the robot or the human operator should conduct a certain rescue task with respect to the prior
knowledge and experiences; the MAXQ algorithm decomposes the overall SAR tasks into four types
of subtasks that can be learned simultaneously: local navigation (obstacle avoidance), navigate to
unvisited regions, victim identiﬁcation, and human control; each subtask can be further decomposed
into child tasks recursively until each child task is a primitive action of the robot; then a task hierarchy
can be built by iteratively mapping all the possible states of a subtask to its child tasks; each state-action
pair is associated with a action-value function, which represents the expected cumulative reward for
performing the action in the given state when following the task hierarchy; the MAXQ HRL-based
learning algorithm updates the values of each state-action pair based on the received positive or
negative rewards (e.g. a positive reward is given to the local navigation subtask when a collision is
avoided) and the action with the highest value is selected as the optimal policy.

One of the major challenges that teleoperated or semi-autonomous rescue robots face today is the
high human-to-robot ratio (The human-to-robot ratio denotes the number of people needed to operate a
robot.), which reaches 2 : 1 or even 3 : 1 in the current state of practice [166]. The high human-to-robot
ratio restricts the scale of rescue robots to be deployed in the devastated region since too many

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

20 of 33

operators can signiﬁcantly increase the logistic burden and the training cost. One feasible solution to
this problem is the use of homogeneous swarm robots, which are easier to control and understand. For
instance, the research in [167] employs a team of homogeneous robots to search and explore several
disaster sites; because of the possible environmental changes and robot failures in disaster sites, the
robots are required to continuously redistribute to fulﬁll the desired population fraction of robots at
each site; furthermore, due to the harsh physical conditions and resource limitations, the inter-robot
communications can be unreliable and costly, and are not easily applicable during an search and
rescue operation; hence, this study proposes a task allocation policy to redistribute the robots from
an initial distribution to the desired distribution without inter-robot communications; the relation
between population fraction of robots at each site and the elapsed time from the start of the process is
expressed by a bunch of ordinary differential equations, under the assumption that the graph model
of the devastated region and all the transition probabilities for a certain robot to traverse from a
certain site to another are known to all the robots; by solving the ordinary differential equations, each
robot can compute the time point when the system reaches the desired distribution in a decentralised
manner. Inspired by the self-organised behavior of social insects, the study in [168] extends the work
in [167] and proposes a stochastic task allocation strategy to assign a swarm of homogeneous robots to
various tasks during an search and rescue operation without inter-robot communications; the latency
(transition time) for a robot to switch from one task to another is modeled by an Erlang distribution to
capture the fact that the transition times have positive, minimum possible values and a small likelihood
of being large because of low battery power, accidents or breakdowns; hence, the behaviours of the
swarm are modelled by a bunch of delay differential equations with population fractions as variables;
these delay differential equations are then converted into equivalent ordinary differential equations by
ﬁtting the transition times with empirical values; by solving these ordinary differential equations, each
robot can calculate the time point when the swarm reaches the desired population fractions at tasks in
a distributed manner; to ensure the fast convergence of the system, the transition probabilities for a
certain robot to switch from a certain task to another are optimised with various optimisation tools.

Owing to the diverse and complex tasks in rescue operations, most of the recently proposed USAR
robot systems consist of heterogeneous robots with different capabilities instead of homogeneous
robots. For instance, the research in [169] proposes a robot group which consists of three types of
robots to rescue victims during nuclear plant accidents; information-collecting robots are used to
gather the location and posture information of victims; traction robots are employed to manipulate
the victims’ posture to an easy-to-carry state; transportation robots are coupled to form a stretcher to
carry victims out of the hazardous area; to manipulate the posture of a victim to a desired attitude,
the body of the victim is simpliﬁed as a link model where limbs are considered as links and joints
are considered as vertices; the angle deviation between the targeted posture and the initial posture
is calculated by the dot product of the vectors associated with these two postures; a robotic hand is
attached on the traction robots to grasp and move the limbs of the victim; to avoid the human body
from colliding with the walls during the transport process, a Generalised Voronoi Graph based motion
path planning algorithm is utilised to compute a path that is equidistant from the surrounding walls
and the obstacles. The study in [170] presents a USAR robot system which contains aerial robots and
a land robot to detect the potential survivors in high-destruction locations after an earthquake; the
aerial robots are responsible for mapping the interested area, searching desired paths with less debris
and more victims for the land robot, and maintaining the communications between the land robot and
remote human operators; on the other hand, the land robot is used to detect survivors with speciﬁc
sensors such as onboard cameras; to climb over debris or partially destroyed stairs, the land robot,
which is composed of a main body and a frontal body with two side tracked wheels, is designed with
the shape-shifting ability; the relative angular orientation between the main body and the frontal body
is adaptable to adjust the mass center of the robot and provide extra traction power; moreover, to
free the human operators from tedious and difﬁcult tasks, this system also provide an immersive
3D head-mounted display to improve the situation awareness of the human operators, and a visual

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

servoing based automatic docking subsystem to dock and undock the robot to the tether, which carries
an electrical power supply and communication devices.

In addition, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed robotic systems, various real and simulated
scenarios have been designed in the last two decades. The research in [171] designs a test arena with
collapsed structures to evaluate the agility, planning or mapping algorithms and sensing ability of
rescue robots. To mimic large scale disasters, a proving ground namely “Disaster City” with a size
of 210, 000m2 has been built by the US Federal Emergency Agency (FEMA) to conduct rescue drills
for robots [172]. The European counterparts are the Rescue Robot Fieldtest which simulates a trafﬁc
accident involving a hazardous material truck and European Land Robot Trials (ELROB) that can
imitate a large scale incident such as a terrorist attack at a public event. The RoboCupRescue simulator
in [173] integrates various disaster models and intelligent agents to build a virtual environment, and a
real-world interface is designed to connect the virtual world with facilities in the real disaster ﬁeld;
evacuees’ decisions and rescue plans are transmitted back to the simulator via a human-machine
interface.

3.2. Emergency Search and Rescue Planning Algorithms

The state-of-the-art emergency search and rescue planning studies are originated and derived
from research in maritime search and rescue activities, which has been a signiﬁcant research topic
since 1970s. Related algorithms in emergency search and rescue planning are commonly under the
assumption that multiple agents (rescuers, robots, etc.) are involved. The reason behind this is twofold.
First, time efﬁciency is the dominant factor for the success of a search and rescue operation, and
multi-agent based search and rescue operations are obviously more efﬁcient than single-agent based
search and rescue operations. Second, multi-agent systems are generally more cost-efﬁcient and
feasible than a single agent with all the capabilities [174]. In recent decades, related algorithms have
aroused a new interest in not only searching victims in hazardous environments, but also de-mining
[175] and planetary exploration [176]. The philosophy behind team-based search and rescue is to
convert a complex problem into simpler sub-problems that are more efﬁcient to solve. These algorithms
are be classiﬁed into three types: ﬁrst, searching algorithms, which are dedicated to search and locate
injured evacuees in unknown environments, speciﬁcally concentrating on coordinating the search
hehaviours of rescuers to produce “swarm intelligence”; second, resource allocation algorithms, which
aim to assign rescuers to injured evacuees in a desired manner when the locations of evacuees are
revealed; third, navigation algorithms, which focus on discovering appropriate paths for rescuers
when the locations of evacuees are known. In this section, we review the related algorithms of ﬁrst two
categories. The third category is excluded here since all the on-line emergency navigation algorithms
are applicable to this case, and the detailed review can be found in Section 2.2.2.

3.2.1. Searching Algorithms in Emergency Search and Rescue Planning

The research in [177] proposes a particle swarm optimisation (PSO) based multi-robot system to
ﬁnd targets by gradually optimising the pre-deﬁned goal function; each robot is modeled as a particle
whose velocity and position is determined by the neighbouring particles and the previous best position
of this particle. Similarly, the study in [178] designs a PSO based multi-robot system to search targets
and avoid obstacles in an unknown environment; specially, a relative coordinate system is used to
avoid the dependence of the precise global location of robots. By employing a bio-inspired random
search behaviour called lévy ﬂight, the research in [179] presents an efﬁcient multi-robot searching
algorithm to search targets in an unknown environment; an artiﬁcial potential ﬁeld is used to generate
repulsive forces to disperse robots amongst the area of interest. The research in [180] deploys robots
in a triangular grid pattern, which can minimise the number of robot required for the coverage of
an area, to search an unknown zone; the targeted area is ﬁrstly partitioned into equilateral triangles
and then the robots will search along the edges of the triangular grid. To minimise the total travel
distance during the search process, the study in [181] utilises an auction based algorithm to assign

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

22 of 33

desired tours to robots. The research in [182] presents a multi-robot coordination algorithm to identify
ﬁre sources in an indoor environment; exploration frontiers are extracted and assigned to robots to
minimise the overall exploration time. Frontier-based searching algorithms such as [165,183] normally
concentrate on assigning robots to the boundary line between the visited and unvisited areas; the
search direction is commonly affected by the cost for a robot to explore a boundary area (e.g. the
probability of an obstacle or another robot being present) and the cost for the robot to reach the target
boundary area (e.g. the distance from the target boundary area). The study in [184] investigates an
interesting research issue of searching a ﬁxed object in an unknown environment with a number of
searchers performing Brownian motions; the searchers are sent out consecutively from the source to
locate the object at a ﬁnite distance D, the search space is unbounded and the distance D is unknown;
each searcher is subject to a ﬁnite life span and could be destroyed or disabled during the search; a
time-out is set by the source to eliminate searchers that search for a long time without discovering the
object; when the time-out elapses, a new searcher will be sent out to replace the “lost” searchers; a
closed form expression for the average search time is derived as a function of the distance between the
source and the object (“D”) by modelling the search process as a multidimensional Brownian process;
the experimental results show that the average search time is affected by number, life span, routing
uncertainty, destruction rate of the searchers. The research in [185] presents a robotic search and rescue
system to search for victims in rubbles with lost cost homogeneous robots carrying thermal array
sensors; a general suppression control framework, which is inspired by the suppression mechanism of
the human immune system, is proposed to regulate the searching and exception handling behaviours
of the robots.

3.2.2. Resource Allocation Algorithms in Emergency Search and Rescue Planning

The study in [151] presents a resource allocation algorithm on the basis of the Random Neural
Network (RNN) with synchronised interactions [89] to assign rescuers to trapped victims in a
ﬁre-affected building; to optimise this task assignment process, several effect factors such as the
cost of assigning a rescuer to a victim (e.g. the distance between the rescuer and the victim), the
probability that a rescuer fails to save a victim, and the associated penalty that the rescuer fails to
rescue the victim are taken into consideration, and are transformed into a goal function which reﬂects
the trade-off between the total successful rescue costs and the failure penalties; the RNN is utilised as a
fast optimisation algorithm to minimise the goal function with a gradient descent learning procedure;
in the RNN, each possible rescuer-victim pair is considered as a neuron, and the neuron with the
highest excitation probability after the training process is selected as the decision. The research in [186]
proposes a task allocation algorithm for heterogeneous agents in hazard environments with respect
to time, space and communication restrictions; to reduce the communication load and links among
agents, each agent elects the agent with the most direct neighbours within its communication range as
the communication network leader; the elected network leader will be responsible for maintaining the
communication among intra-network agents and other network leaders; to ensure the appropriate
distance among task locations and the agents, each network leader further divides its coverage area
into sub-areas by using the mean shift clustering algorithm; the window radius parameter h in the
mean shift clustering algorithm is set to the communication range of the network leader to guarantee
that the agents in the same sub-area can always communicate with each other; heterogeneous agents
are then allocated into these sub-areas in terms of their abilities and the requirements of tasks within
the sub-areas: ﬁrstly, the “similarity” value of each agent sub-area pair is calculated by the dot
product [187] of the vector of the requirements of tasks and the normalised vector of ability of the
agent; secondly, the agent will be assigned to the sub-area with the highest similarity value. As
aforementioned in subsection 3.1.2, the studies in [167,168] employ an ordinary differential equation
model to redistribute rescue robots among various tasks in a decentralised manner without inter-robot
communications; the relation between population fractions at tasks and the elapsed time since the
start of the process is expressed by a set of ordinary differential equations; by substituting the desired

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

23 of 33

population fraction in each task into the proposed model, each robot can independently calculate the
time point when the system reaches the desired distribution.

4. Emerging Challenges and Opportunities

After decades of study and exploration, emergency management has become a mature research
ﬁeld. However, due to its open and inclusive nature, new technologies always tend to inﬂuence,
change or even revolutionise this research area. In this section we discuss open issues and provide
possible directions for future work. We also visualise these research directions by using a sunburst
chart as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. A sunburst chart illustrating the potential research directions.

The emergence of heuristic based algorithms has offered near-optimal solutions for emergency
management in a computationally and time efﬁcient manner at the trade-off of optimality and
completeness. However, the setting of key parameters in heuristics could play a vital role in
system performance and the perfect parameter settings for one evacuation scenario may not suit
others. Hence, currently, signiﬁcant parameters involved in heuristics are mostly pre-conﬁgured in a
supervised-learning fashion rather than using a unsupervised learning paradigm and therefore may
not adapt to uncertain or fast-changing environments, and may even need to be calibrated manually in
different scenarios. Taking WSN-based algorithms for example, the work in [145] has shown that these
parameters could contribute signiﬁcantly to the efﬁciency of route discovery and information collection.
For instance, if the time-to-live of packets is too large, the system will be overburdened with packets
that are in effect lost. On the other hand, if the live-time constraint is too small, some distant exits may
not be discovered. Likewise, the improper packet rate could induce unnecessary energy consumption
when appropriate paths have been discovered and the network situation stays unchanged. Hence,
future research can be directed to optimising the setting of parameters from a systemic point of view
by utilising proper queueing network models or diffusion models. Potential differentiated services
(DiffServ) mechanisms could be also developed to optimise the packet behaviours and satisfy the QoS
requirements of different categories of cognitive packets which are associated with diverse classes of
evacuees. Furthermore, parameter optimisation algorithms or even parameter free algorithms can

 Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

24 of 33

be developed by gaining experience from iterations of various simulated scenarios with the aid of
newly-proposed machine learning algorithms such as deep learning.

Compared with emergency drills, computer simulations are commonly utilised to investigate
the effectiveness of emergency management algorithms due to their time-efﬁciency, repeatability and
cost-efﬁciency. However, many human behaviours during emergency evacuations have been ignored
in the simulations. Hence, future research can also be directed to develop various human-computer
interfaces for simulators to generate an artiﬁcial hazard environment with virtual reality and
augmented reality technologies [188]. By evacuating volunteers from the artiﬁcial hazard environment,
their emergent behaviours can be collected and empirical collective behaviour models of human beings
can be developed from the actual crowd measurements.

One trending in emergency management is to develop artiﬁcial intelligence aided algorithms to
improve path-ﬁnding and resource allocation during standard or emergent evacuations. However,
as a typical category of cyber-physical systems, the intelligence of evacuees, as well as the possible
pro-social behaviours such as helpfulness and sense of duty, have been excluded in the previous
algorithms. As a result, the robustness of these algorithms cannot be ensured due to the high likelihood
that evacuees do not follow the instructions. Moreover, unnecessary efforts have been dedicated to the
use of AI, while in fact many tasks can be easily accomplished by evacuees in the system via using
human intelligence. For instance, the identiﬁcation of a ﬁre source location could take signiﬁcant efforts
when using AI-based algorithms, which involves in the installation of cameras and the use of computer
version related technologies. However, it would take no time or cost for evacuees to identify a ﬁre
and report to authorities or the emergency response system by using smart phones. In attempting to
incentivise evacuees to conduct cooperative behaviours and avoid destructive behaviours, one future
research direction could be dedicated to the investigation of reward mechanisms to integrate the human
intelligence of evacuees into the emergency response systems to improve the efﬁciency, adaptiveness
and robustness of these systems. On the other hand, since most of the previous multi-robot rescue
systems only follow simple coordination rules and lack explicit teamwork models or goals [189],
multi-agent technologies can also be utilised to model and develop various cooperative strategies with
the aid of queueing network models such as G-networks [190] or genetic algorithms.

The rapid development of Cloud technologies has facilitated the advancement of cloud-enabled
emergency management systems that consist of front-end portable devices and back-end cloud severs.
Future research can be directed to further improve the ﬂexibility of the kind of system by leveraging the
mobile agent technology, because current cloud-based emergency response systems, which are based
on the client-sever paradigm, demand pre-installed services in participating devices [191]. Moreover,
since mobile agents can migrate seamlessly through multiple clouds and different portable devices, a
mobile agent-based emergency response system has the potential to reduce communication costs and
ease network congestion in large-scale emergency evacuations by dynamically optimising the locations
of mobile agents. Moreover, we believe that future emergency management systems should not only
make use of the computing power of portable devices and the Cloud, but also other individual devices
in the vicinity to offer services with the aid of edge computing and fog computing.

Although the ﬁre alarm system has become a norm for modern buildings, more complicated
emergency management systems mostly remain in prototype form and are only veriﬁed in simulations
or speciﬁc test ﬁelds. The raising of the concept “smart city” has provided a golden opportunity for
emergency management systems to be integrated into the smart city “eco-system” and take advantage
of this tide to achieve leapfrogging. The potential research directions are threefold. First, with the
recent increase of manmade disasters, physical attacks are highly likely to be accompanied with cyber
attacks. Hence, it is of critical importance to develop self-aware networks to self-defense and maintain
communications during an evacuation process. On suggested framework is CPN, which is naturally
efﬁcient on defending various forms of malicious attacks such as denial of service attacks [192]. This is
because, unlike the IP protocol, smart packets in the CPN carry the “full path” from the source node
to the destination node. Hence, CPN can defend denial of service attacks by adaptively dropping

Version July 10, 2019 submitted to Electronics

25 of 33

attacking packets upstream from the node being attacked via backtracking the full path of attacking
ﬂows. Second, due to the energy hungry communication and computation processes inside emergency
management systems as well as the fact that wireless sensors are difﬁcult to be replenished, energy
efﬁcient and energy harvesting algorithms, such as dynamic programming and G-network models
[193–195], can be applied to future emergency management systems to improve the performance
and efﬁciency of these systems. Third, the massive deployment of sensors with the prosperity of
the Internet of Things(IoT) and smart city technologies improve the efﬁcient collection of individual
data on a vast scale. This suggests a crucial new opportunity to use big data technologies to analyse,
model and reﬁne the personal preferences, human collective choices and behaviours, and general
rules with respect to the routinely collected data, and use them as guidance for the future emergency
management algorithm and system design.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we provide a systemic review of the emergency management research. In the ﬁrst
section, we review the history and evolution of this ﬁeld, trace its transformation from a reactive manner
to a proactive manner. We also explore the impact of the development of computer technologies, which
has shaped the current research. In the second section, we review the emergency search and rescue
planning from both system design aspect and algorithm engineering aspect. In the system review
part, various wearable computing-assisted rescue systems, and search & rescue robotic systems are
introduced. In the algorithm review part, representative searching, resource allocation and navigation
algorithms are discussed. Similarly, in the third section, we summarise classical emergency navigation
systems and algorithms. The systems are classiﬁed into human experience driven systems, static WSN
based systems, mixed WSN based systems, cloud based systems with WSN, and cloud based systems
with mobile phones. The algorithms are divided into off-line navigation algorithms and on-line
emergency navigation algorithms. The off-line navigation algorithms are further divided into cellular
automata model based algorithms, social force model based algorithms, ﬂuid-dynamics model based
algorithms, lattice gas model based algorithms, game theoretic model based algorithms, computer
agents based algorithms and animal agent based algorithms. On the other hand, on-line emergency
navigation algorithms are classiﬁed into network ﬂow based algorithms, geometric algorithms,
queueing model based algorithms, potential-maintenance algorithms, biologically inspired algorithms,
routing protocol based algorithms and prediction-based algorithms. In the next section, we discuss the
emerging challenges and opportunities under the background of the fast development and prosperity
of new technologies such as smart city, artiﬁcial intelligence, virtual reality, big data, cyber security
and energy efﬁciency & harvesting.
