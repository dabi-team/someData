Abstract

This study presents a methodology to quantify vulnerability of cyber attacks and their impacts based on
probabilistic graphical models for intelligent transportation systems under connected and autonomous
vehicles framework. Cyber attack vulnerabilities from various types and their impacts are calculated for
intelligent signals and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) applications based on the selected
performance measures. Numerical examples are given that show impact of vulnerabilities in terms of
average intersection queue lengths, number of stops, average speed, and delays. At a signalized network
with and without redundant systems, vulnerability can increase average queues and delays by 3% and
15% and 4% and 17%, respectively. For CACC application, impact levels reach to 50% delay diﬀerence
on average when low amount of speed information is perturbed. When signiﬁcantly diﬀerent speed
characteristics are inserted by an attacker, delay diﬀerence increases beyond 100% of normal traﬃc
conditions.

Keywords: Risk analysis, connected and autonomous vehicles, intelligent signals, CACC, Bayesian
Networks.

1. Introduction

Transportation networks are one of the critical infrastructures that need to be strategically managed
via vulnerabilities for dynamic threats and hazards to achieve secure and resilient cities (C´ardenas et al.
(2011); Chowdhury et al. (2019)). Resilience includes a protective strategy against unknown or highly
uncertain events. Possible tools to improve resiliency can be listed as diversiﬁcation and sensors, reduc-
ing vulnerability, design of ﬂexible systems, and improve conditions for system adaptation (Aven et al.
(2013)). In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), in order to increase security and resiliency (i.e., in-
clude safety and mobility) against possible attacks or benign system errors by diﬀerent events (Mitchell and Chen
(2014),Humayed et al. (2017)), research is needed on physical models for attack, detection, and mitiga-
tion using various redundant sensors and additional information. Furthermore, level of ﬂexibility and
predictability also need be investigated research for control systems. Such system would have to keep con-
ventional sensors for redundancy as well as validating reading from connected components (Peisert et al.
(2014)).

Intelligent transportation systems applications with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as-
sume some market penetration level and rely on them for system control such as traﬃc signals, emergency
vehicle management, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) or platooning, and real-time routing
etc. Thus, any additional uncertainty would cause sub-optimal system control, failures, and incidents
in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we aim to address this issue with system level uncertainty
quantiﬁcation of cyber attacks on ITS applications particularly involving CAVs and methods to incor-
porate such in stochastic models based on the National Intelligent Transportation System Reference

Architecture (ARC-IT) and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). Attack types on CAVs
can be listed but not limited to jamming, spooﬁng, illusion, blinding, replay, data manipulation, eaves-
dropping, routing, DOS, impersonation, and coordinated multiple attacks (Petit and Shladover (2015);
Chowdhury et al. (2019)). Author’s previous work looked at simpler version for isolated intelligent sig-
nals (Comert et al. (2018)). This study signiﬁcantly extends previous work by incorporating cooperative
adaptive cruise control (CACC or also called platooning) with microsimulations and network version
of both BNs and intelligent signals. Approach is modular so model can be improved when detection
interfaces and series of other vehicles added. More interestingly, series of vehicles in a platoon (i.e.,
probabilistic graph model as hidden Markov model) are given to propagate risk in multiple interacting
networks (i.e., under connected vehicles).

Attack detection and mitigation on physical system models are some of the recent approaches gaining
interest. For diﬀerent types of cyber attacks (e.g., (Petit and Shladover (2015); van der Heijden et al.
(2016))), risk areas (components or nodes), cost of diﬀerent attacks, and detection of abnormal messages
within driver, vehicle, and infrastructure context are modeled via probabilistic graphical models (e.g.,
Bayesian Networks (BNs) (Al-Sultan et al. (2013); Cao et al. (2015))) and traﬃc simulations with vari-
ous scenarios. Results would be used for strategic allocation of redundancy systems, optimal detection
deployment, and generation of mitigation techniques. The critical issue, however, when data and inter-
action among CAVs included, any error would result in signiﬁcant costs. For instance, false revoking
emergency vehicle security certiﬁcate would result in life-endangering situations. Similarly, delay caused
by device ﬂooding or denial of service (DOS) on transit and freight trucks would result as excessive delay,
fuel consumption, and emissions.

Vulnerability deﬁned as combination of the impacts of the application considered and associated
uncertainties (levels) given an initiating event (risk source/attack surface) (Aven (2015)) and formulated
as Vulnerability | A=Impacts+Uncertainty | the occurrence of the event A. Risk quantiﬁcation is one of
the fundamental research areas under decision support systems. One of the key review studies summarizes
the research and the needs in last decade (Aven (2016)). As targeted by this study, risk assessment
on interdependent critical infrastructures was listed as one of the needs. The author also emphasized
developing unifying platform related to risk, vulnerability, and probability. In a relevant study, attack
impact cost was quantiﬁed by binomial lattice model (Khansa and Liginlal (2009)) on ﬁrms’ information
security investments. The study provides switching options in case of emergency.

Attack modeling in game-theoretic framework is also gaining interest (Cheung and Bell (2019)). How-
ever, realistic physical model of the problem is critical recognized by the researchers similar to indus-
trial control systems (Sridhar and Govindarasu (2014); Li et al. (2019); Maziku et al. (2019)). For in-
stance on ﬂood control system, risk and impact were quantiﬁed by factorial probabilistic inference in
(Wang and Huang (2016)). In another fundamental review study (Mitchell and Chen (2014)), authors
studied reputation management in vehicular networks for both detection and mitigation. Likewise, in
(van der Heijden et al. (2016)) for ITS applications, revoking or blacklisting the information producers
are presented. One of two main issues in CAVs, safety critical applications and privacy of the drivers
In order to facilitate easier and cost
are also investigated by the researchers (Sucasas et al. (2016)).
eﬀective decision making, standardization of actions based on index calculated for various attacker type
(i.e., intelligent or random) were attempted also (Bier and Gutfraind (2019)). Cost of impact of broad
cyber events in ﬁrms was modeled using extreme event theory (Eling and Wirfs (2019)). Similar to this
study, modular and probabilistic approach allows modelers to be able to incorporate other attack types
and their likelihoods easily.

1.1. Contribution of this paper

In this study, traﬃc systems are modeled analytically via a probabilistic graphical networks to demon-
strate possible vulnerabilities, propagation of such vulnerabilities, impacts of them as performance mea-
sures, and eﬀect of possible redundant components on the vulnerabilities are developed for decision
makers. Particular contributions can be listed as: (1) uncertainty quantiﬁcation on ITS applications

with cyber-physical representation, (2) application of a probabilistic expert systems (BNs) for modeling
anomalies and attacks (malicious messages/benign failures) are produced, and (3) impact of redundancy
systems (sensors and surveillance systems) and number of diﬀerent traﬃc states (versus control reliability)
are incorporated.

1.2. Organization of the paper

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the approach’s relevance in risk analysis and
decision support. Section 3 introduces the problem and the approach. Section 4 explains the modeling
and Bayesian networks. Section 5 presents simulations from BNs and process simulators and their results.
Section 6 includes the detailed numerical experiments for quantiﬁcation of uncertainty due to attacks on
CACC (or platooning) and traﬃc network with intelligent signals (ISIG). The section also describes
analysis with and without sensors at isolated and network of signals. Finally, section 7 summarizes
ﬁndings and addresses possible future research directions.

2. Approach

Throughout the paper, fundamental deﬁnitions were adopted from Aven (2015). Vulnerability is
considered to be part of risk analysis and risk analysis can be referred as risk and vulnerability anal-
ysis Aven (2015). Concept of vulnerability is simply deﬁned as risks given occurrence of an event,
(i.e.,Risks|Threats∨Hazard∨Attack). A conditional event can be described as C ′ factors to deﬁne con-
sequences or impacts, uncertainty Q as probabilities, and K background knowledge from cited works.
Thus, vulnerability of system can be expressed as V =(C ′, Q, K|A). This relation summarizes our ap-
proach presented in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the methodology for vulnerability V =(C′, Q, K|A) assessment (based on Aven (2011))

Overall, our approach falls under operational vulnerability, vulnerability analysis+ evaluation equal to
vulnerability assessment (Aven et al. (2013)). And, assessment and some steps from planning are covered
in the risk analysis process. Vulnerability management consists of high risk+uncertainties leads challenge
in this diﬃculty in predicting outcomes. By Aven et al. (2013), beneﬁts of a vulnerability analysis
are listed as: (1) drawing a vulnerability picture, (2) comparing alternative solutions with respect to
vulnerability, (3) identifying factors and components that are critical with respect to vulnerability, (4)
demonstrating the eﬀect of various measures to vulnerability, and (5) conducting this analysis mainly
to support decision making concerns, safety, and costs. Uncertainty in vulnerability assessment can
be expressed as identiﬁcation of relevant threats, hazards, cause, and consequences analysis, including
assessment of exposures and vulnerable risk description.

Similarly, the basis for the analysis in the paper: (1) evaluations of ITS applications by design, (2)
drawing conclusions on what design and measure meet the stated requirements in current standards, (3)
evaluating related performance of the preparedness of ITS systems, and (4) documenting the vulnerability
levels. Hence, generate knowledge to support decision making that would provide an important basis for
ﬁnding the right balance among diﬀerent hazards, components, safety, and costs (Aven et al. (2013)).

3. Problem Deﬁnition

Primary goal in this paper is to develop models for probabilistic vulnerabilities (Borgonovo et al.
(2018)) in interested ITS applications with respect to considered attack surfaces (A) (see Fig. 1) and
quantify the impact on traﬃc ﬂow. Within vulnerability (C ′, Q, K|A) assessment framework, as graphical
model, Bayesian networks are modeled based on physical diagram of applications (e.g., CACC and ISIG
in Fig. 2a) deﬁned in ARC-IT (2020) (e.g., knowledge K). In the second step, risk levels are obtained from
(Petit and Shladover (2015); Comert et al. (2018)) (also K). Third, vulnerability scores are calculated
from propagated conditional probabilities (Q) based on (NIST (2017)). Lastly, simulations are given for
impact (C ′) studies to quantify propagated risk on traﬃc.

Based on uncertainty assessment of vulnerabilities (Aven et al. (2013)), i.e., process to classify the
strength of metrics discussed by the authors, studied cases can be categorized as medium strength of
knowledge to be able to infer exact and critical assignment. However, variables, state values, and levels
are adopted from ARC-IT (2020) and NIST (2017).

In Fig. 2b, possible CACC components are shown which represent physical devices.

In a platoon
(with autonomous vehicles) setting, each vehicle can have a communication device (i.e., onboard equip-
ment (OBE)) (Dey et al. (2015)). For the nodes, the security certiﬁcate authority (e.g. USDOT-security
credential management system (SA)) is interfaced to OBEs and is used to provide security certiﬁcates
to trusted OBEs. Some or all of these vehicles can be equipped, that is, they have some type of portable
device which can communicate traﬃc control system (via RSE). Traﬃc control system consists of signal
controller, other surveillance technologies and environmental sensors, and the RSE (or a communication
device). The RSE radio referred to the 5.9 GHz Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) commu-
nications between the vehicles and the infrastructure, however, other wireless communications can also be
considered. For communications, speciﬁc channels are designated for broadcasting basic safety messages
(BSM s), the map message, and the signal phase and timing messages, and signal status messages.

Rather broader view of a traﬃc network, controllers can be viewed as a part of traﬃc management
system (T M C) as shown in Fig 2b. Thus, diﬀerent control devices can be connected via communications
can be coordinated for various modes of transportation. These modes can be sensed by diﬀerent detection
technologies (ﬁxed-inductive loops, video, infrared, radar, magnetic plates, pedestrian buttons or solely
mobile-GPS, and cell phones etc.). These detectors provide information to the control algorithms for
presence to change application states. Some of these communications are direct (pedestrian push button)
and some are based on inference (video cameras-queues).

Functions of the OBE in a CACC are processing other OBE data, processing pedestrian protection,
processing indicator output data for roads, monitoring RSE operation, processing indicator output data
for signals or users, and provide device interface for ﬁeld management stations. Impact on applications
can be listed such as data distribution for speed harmonization, emergency vehicle preemption, freight
signal priority, pedestrian mobility, and red light violation warning. For simpliﬁcation, however, impact
of attacks on platooning is represented as changes in exchanged speed by platoon leader’s OBE, i.e.,
average and total delays.

In Comert et al. (2018), possible intelligent signal components was given. An intelligent signal (ISIG)
as a system would include a controller unit with a processor and connections (e.g., ethernet or wireless, or
other ports) (see also architecture of connected adaptive signal (Head et al. (2016))). This physical signal
model is utilized to test possible attack scenarios and impacts. In the network setting, each intersection is
assumed to be equipped with a communication technology. A traﬃc management system is also included.
Functions of an intelligent signal controller can be listed as processing: traﬃc sensor data; pedestrian
protection; indicator output data for roads and for other signals or users; RSE operation and signal
control conﬂict monitoring; and device interface for ﬁeld management stations. Impact on applications
can be experienced through data distribution for eco-signaling, eco-transit, emergency vehicle preemption,
freight signal priority, pedestrian mobility, red light violation warning, transit signal priority.
In this
paper, impact of attacks on ISIGs is represented as changes in service times thus average and maximum

queue lengths in vehicles and delays in seconds (time spent in queue and server).

4. Bayesian Networks

Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphical stochastic expert systems that depict conditional
(in)dependence of probability distributions of interests. In this section, Bayesian or Belief networks for
system risk analysis is discussed (Rausand (2013); Aven (2015)). Probabilistic graphical models represent
the causal connections among various variables denoted as nodes at diﬀerent levels (Cai et al. (2011)).
These nodes can be at many states. Hence, more complex systems can be analyzed by BNs compared to
fault tree analysis with two states. In order to determine conditional probabilities given causal connec-
tivity direct, argument, or speciﬁed procedures, BNs constructed that establish the probabilities for the
various quantities (events) in the network. Then, the probabilities are calculated. BNs in cybersecurity
context are utilized to model hypothesized communications and generate vulnerability/reliability of the
network tested with possible attacks at traﬃc networks (Al-Sultan et al. (2013); Huang and Nicol (2014);
Wan et al. (2014)). Example cases on safety can be seen in MacKay (2003); Barber (2012) and other

applications in Chin et al. (2009); Zhang et al. (2013); Gill et al. (2019).

In this study, such hazards are adapted for CAVs framework (Petit and Shladover (2015)). Physical
model in Fig. 2b are modiﬁed via addition of detection interfaces. Additionally, intelligent signal model
was included multiple modes, back up surveillance systems, and series of other signals in BNs and simu-
lations. BNs are employed to calculate probability distribution, expected vulnerability and its standard
deviation via Monte Carlo simulations, and some predictions are provided given assumed evidence for dif-
ferent scenarios. Variables and their discrete states are deﬁned. Note that these are assumptions mostly
compiled from (Petit and Shladover (2015); ARC-IT (2020); NIST (2017)). First, nodes and edges are
deﬁned from the Fig. 2b. These nodes are the variables that are impacting vehicle on-board equipment
(OBE) state. Parental nodes along with their vulnerability scores are given as in Table 1 (ARC-IT
(2020); Petit and Shladover (2015); Comert et al. (2018)).

Table 1 essentially is a risk matrix with description based on consequence categories. Again vulnera-
bility is given an threat or event V =Risk|A, even after simulations how can we model this vulnerability
is needed. Step-by-step, the expected value of E(C ′|A) with states of level of impacts (consequences)
such as low, medium, and high are deduced. This expectation can be calculated by P (A)E(C ′|A), i.e.,
Vulnerability Score=P(attack occurs)P(attack result in damage attack occurs)E(impact|attack and re-
sults in impact) (Aven (2015)). This main approach is risk analysis method of classiﬁcation based on
expected consequences.

Regardless, assumed probability distributions may not adequately explain the event likelihoods then

character in the case of incomplete information. Thus, diﬀerent probability and necessity measures
are assigned for risk. This approach is closely related fuzzy logic or Grey systems. Evidence (Dempster-
Shafer) theory with belief functions is very similar to Bayesian treatment. In our approach, a probabilistic
vulnerability assessment with uncertainty propagation is adopted with initial probabilities and evidence-
Bayesian from existing literature knowledge.

4.1. CACC Application

For a CACC application model, constraints of the system or assumed variables, their description, and
metrics (states) are given in Table 2. As for intelligent signals, attack surfaces are adopted from the list
in Table 1.

Fig. 3a and 3b show the designed BNs under dependencies among the nodes given in Table 2 for single
OBE and a platoon with 10 vehicles connected through OBEs, respectively. This is critical as reliability
of OBE could increase via additional ground truth check or observer. However, it will need additional
cost. Similarly, detection nodes can be seen as cost for monitoring and delay of communications. In the
ﬁgure, OBE is connected on other OBEs and IT S devices, T M C, and most importantly RSE. Suppose

Probabilities (posteriors) in Eq. (5) from BNs are calculated by the junction tree algorithm with
computational complexity of O(n3). The algorithm actually yields the multiplication of conditional
probabilities including the independence, thus, a simpliﬁed version. This algorithm, on directed acyclic
graphs, ﬁrst marries parent nodes. It then triangulates and removes unnecessary links through generation
of cliques, assignments, and message propagation (Barber (2012)).

Note that parent nodes p(DOSR) require probability assumptions for uncertain evidence setting. In
this paper, these scales are adopted from (Petit and Shladover (2015)) and assigned from (NIST (2017)).
Speciﬁcally, deﬁned attack vector levels are {low, medium, high} (L, M, H) and state probabilities for
nodes such as OBE are {none, low, medium, high, critical} (N, L, M, H, C) with corresponding maxi-
mum probability values of {0.25, 0.50, 0.75} and {0.01, 0.39, 0.69, 0.89, 1.0} respectively. In order to ad-
dress the sensitivity of these probabilities are generated randomly from uniform distribution and resulting
posteriors are obtained as probability distributions for each state rather than a point value. Moreover,
resulting expected utility for vulnerability are calculated out of [0, 10] scale where up to 0.1 shows no risk
or impact to 10 is the highest vulnerability. Example of propagated conditional distributions are given
in Table 3 (Højsgaard et al. (2012)).

4.2. Intelligent Signal Application

In modeling, constraints of the system or assumed variables, their description, and states are given
similarly in Table 4 to deﬁne nodes on designed BNs. Details and metrics can be found in (Comert et al.
(2018)). These attacks and metrics on simpliﬁed node set with assumed attack surfaces are listed in
Table 1 are used to generate network in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4a shows the designed BN under assumed dependencies among the nodes similarly given in
Table 2 (seeComert et al. (2018)). This network is a BN with single signal controller including a sensor

(additional detection) node. This is critical as reliability of SC could increase via additional ground
truth check as well as control via this sensor which is quantiﬁed using simulation in section 5. However,
it requires additional cost. Similarly, detection nodes can be seen as cost for monitoring and delay of
communications. In the ﬁgure, SC is connected on pedestrian push buttons (assumed no impact on SC
state), other IT S which can be other signals, T M C, S, and most importantly RSE. In the BN, modes of
regular passenger vehicles, emergency vehicles, freight, transit, motorcycles, and other motorized modes
are also shown. Now, suppose all the nodes can be shown as a set of N ={SC, SA, ..., DCC, LC}. Given,

p(SC) = X
N/SC

Y
N/SC

p(SC|pa(SC))

(4)

where, pa(SC) represents the parental variables of signal controller. Simply when nodes are incorporated,
Eq. (4) follows,

p(SC) = X

p(SC, S, RSE, ..., W SA)

(S,RSE,...,W SA)

= p(SC|S, RSE, ..., W SA)p(RSE|RDS, ...)p(S|U V, U P, EP, ..., T R)...p(W SA)

(5)

As an example joint distribution involving SA risks can be simpliﬁed after conditional independence
and written as in Eq. (6). Inference on p(SA) can be deduced after summing up for (SDS, P C, CRL, LT C).

p(SA, SDS, P C, CRL, LT C) = p(P C)p(CRL)p(LT C)p(SDS|P C, CRL, LT C)p(SA|SDS)

p(SA) =

X
(SDS,P C,CRL,LT C)

p(P C)p(CRL)p(LT C)p(SDS|P C, CRL, LT C)p(SA|SDS)

(6)

Example of propagated conditional distributions are given in Table 5. In the table, for diﬀerent state
of RSE, probabilities of states of SC are calculated. Notice that they are all high for none as state of
other nodes are also impacting SC state. If S is f alse, p(SC = none) decreases. Similar probabilities
can be calculated also for other higher nodes. For instance, detection for RSE can be calculated as
P (RSE|RDS). Reasonably from the table, if detection state is low, then RSE can be impacted high
else impact on RSE is low.

5. Simulations

Three main type of simulations are run to evaluate modeling and quantify risks. Monte Carlo sim-
ulations (MCSs) are used to quantify variations on Bayesian Networks by running many cycles and

replications. Microscopic (realistic including vehicle following) and horizontal (simpler and less realistic)
traﬃc simulations are run to quantify impact of attacks in terms of common performance measures.
MCSs are normally alternative to analytical calculation methods such as BNs. With MCSs, time aspect
can be handled better.

terms of analyzing the impact on intelligent signal applications, signal controller is incorporated via
service times at the signalized networks of number of signals in the example network, as shown in Figs. 4
and 7. Primary objectives are quantiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of possible problems and mitigation eﬀorts
for future research. These yield risk areas, impacts, and possible solutions for more resilient systems.
MCSs are given using BNs including an isolated intersection and single OBE as well as replications of
complete BNs mimicking a network (i.e., pattern). MCSs generate probability distributions and expected
utility as well as its dispersion so that conﬁdence intervals can be generated. Pattern approach generates
a Bayesian framework for posterior probability of a critical node common among these signals such as
security (certiﬁcate) authority considering it as a parameter.

5.1.1. CACC

In Fig. 5, probabilities, expected value, and standard deviation of vulnerability of OBE are presented.
Monte Carlo simulations are run for 10, 000 cycles. Boxplots are used in order to show the impact
distribution for 50 replications. Metrics are assigned randomly from uniform distribution. Probabilities
that are used to calculate the moments. Probability of OBE with no eﬀect state is about 94% and about
5% low impact. These values are changing within [0.90, 0.99] and [0.00, 0.15], respectively changing the
central tendency and the dispersion of vulnerabilities. Expected value certainly falls mostly into low
impact > 0.10 region. Median of standard deviations is about 0.95. Thus, a simple conﬁdence interval
for mean level of 0.30 with mean standard deviation of 0.80 from µ±2σ would fall within [0.00, 1.90]. This
is still in the low impact scale. In order to check the eﬀect of randomly generating all metric values. These
values are only assigned for 50 replications but not for each node on BNs. This approach is exploring
enough of the metric ranges and resulting higher dispersion. Hence, all random approach would represent
more robust results.

5.1.2. Intelligent Signals

Probabilities, expected value, and standard deviation of vulnerability of SC are presented. Boxplots
are used in order to show the ranges within 200 replications. Probabilities that are then used to calculate
the moments. Probability of a node (e.g., SC) being in no eﬀect/none level is about 95% and about
5% low impact when a redundant sensor is included. These values are changing between [0.80, 0.99] and
[0, 0.20] respectively changing the central tendency and the dispersion of vulnerabilities. Expected value
certainly falls mostly into low impact > 0.1 region. Median of standard deviations is about 0.95. Thus, a
simple conﬁdence interval for mean level 0.37 with mean standard deviation 0.93 µ ± 2σ would be within
[0, 2.23] which is still in the low impact scale.

Similar values are given in Fig. 6 for without sensor case. Results reveal much higher risk levels
and variations. Risk likelihood is still mainly within low level, however, it is more probable with low
state than none. Conﬁdence interval in this case would be [0.00, 4.81] with mean and standard deviation
values 1.19 and 1.81 respectively. In this case, vulnerability falls into much serious medium level. Same
as before less random version yields higher dispersion with conﬁdence interval [0.00, 5.03] with means
1.28 and 1.87.

Fig. 6. Simulated score values from BN with and without sensors

Fig. 7 shows pattern of 8 BNs in Fig. 4. Essentially, it is a network of controllers with common security
certiﬁcate authority (SA), traﬃc management center, and other IT S devices. Vulnerability of individual
signal controllers (Fig. 8a) as well as entire network (Fig. 8b) is presented in Fig. 8. From the ﬁgure,
similar risks for individual signal controllers can be seen. However, risk reduces in a network setting. In
this system, dependency is represented only through SA, T M C, and IT S nodes. Thus, overall risk is
much less than a single node. It is also observed that a risk in a signal controller increases in a serial
framework based on deﬁned transitions among signal controllers which is intuitive.

5.2. CACC Microscopic Simulation

Microscopic traﬃc simulation environment, VISSIM, generates vehicles with exponential interarrival
times at the origin that traverse links based on realistic vehicle following behavior according. Headways
change as vehicles move along the network based on vehicle composition, vehicle characteristics, driving
behavior, number of lanes, and other network settings. Similar to the complex real-life traﬃc systems
with multiple parameters to control, detailed analysis could be done in order to make sure a fully accurate
comparison under diﬀerent scenarios which is beyond the scope of this paper.

In this study, VISSIM simulations were controlled using COM interface and Matlab integration. For
a basic evaluation purpose, default parameters for vehicle characteristics (e.g., acceleration/deceleration,
type 100 car). Impact of the state probabilities on a 1.85 kilometers (km) section of a two-lane highway
is shown in Fig. 9 using a microscopic simulation VISSIM with 4 platoons of 10 vehicles (v) equipped

(approximately 0.5 s following time headways) and platoons generated 50 meters (m) apart from each
other. Vehicles do accelerate and decelerate based on platoon leader’s speed information passed at 0.1
s intervals, without attack, all platoons stay in tack and stable. Simulation run lengths are 1 hour (h)
where new platoons are generated as other platoons are discharged from the network.

For simpliﬁcation, the facility is not interrupted and communications are not included. Hence,
changes are incorporated only on speed passed within basic safety messages. Average delay and num-
ber of stops are demonstrated for no attack and attack scenarios. As the objective is reﬂecting the
impact of disturbance, possible interruptions are generated from the probability distributions BNs. Im-
pacts are reﬂected on speed on kilometer per hour (kmh) with (none, low, med, high, cri) corresponds to
(0.0, N (5, 5), N (80, 120), N (160, 240), N (320, 480)) kmh with average probabilities OBEs (0.9460, 0.0538,

of vehicles (v)) and waiting times (in seconds (s)) are demonstrated for regular and with impact scenarios.
For set up simulations, ﬁrst saturation level is determined. Comparing with the results from Comert
(2016), isolated intersection with two one way approaches is designed with 45 seconds (s) green each
approach and volumes={500, 600, 700, ..., 2000} vehicles per hour (vph) per approach. Similar results
are observed with saturation at about 1000 vph per approach. Fig. 10 shows volume versus average

Next as shown in Fig. 11, a signalized network with 25 intersections is designed. Each intersec-
tion is placed within 0.61 km taking exponentially on average 46 s to travel from one intersection to
another. As the objective is reﬂecting the impact of disturbance, these dimensions represents a net-
work of intersections with approach capacities that can accommodate maximum of 130 average vehicle
length per approach. Using the same volume rates up to 2200 vph per intersection, possible inter-
ruptions are generated from the probability distributions BNs. Impacts are reﬂected on 1.95 spv with
{none, low, med, high, cri}={1.95,2.60,3.90,9.75,19.5} spv with average probabilities with sensors results
{0.93,0.0685,0.00051,0.0005,0.00049} and without sensors {0.727,0.261,0.00035,0.00046,0.00034}, respec-
tively.

6. Results and Discussions

In this section, numerical results are presented for BNs with and without redundant surveillance
technologies and with and without detectors. Monte Carlo simulations are run for 10, 000 cycles which
results as state probabilities, expected and standard deviation of vulnerability. Simulations are repeated
200 times to obtain distributions of these measures for connected vehicle market penetrations of p =
[0.01, 1.00] which is constituted by {CR = 0.80, EM = 0.03, F R = 0.07, T R = 0.10}. Vehicle and
pedestrian traﬃc are 95% and 5%.

Fig. 12 demonstrates overall summary of the impact of risk levels on queue lengths and delays obtained
from process traﬃc simulations which can be viewed as realistic between microscopic and point queue
simulations. Isolated results are adopted from (Comert et al. (2018)) and presented for comparison in
this paper. Impact on single intersection is much higher about 15% average QL, 10% max queue length,
and 15% delay increase with a sensor. Without any sensor, changes are much higher with average 125%
average QL, 66% max queue length, and 125% delay across all volume levels. For network, the eﬀect
observed to be less average over all 25 signals, approaches, and volumes 3% average QL, 3% max queue
length, and 5% delay with sensor and 15% average QL, 10% max queue length, and 17% delay without
sensor case.

expected and higher than isolated intersection values. After 1600 vph, values for network simulations are
getting less than that of isolated case. This observation could be due to lack of run length for network
case when volume is higher meaning vehicles are not discharged as many at downstream signals compared
upstream ones. Regardless, looking at the system performance after one hour with various volume levels,
results reﬂect the impact of the incorporated risk which can be experienced at this level after one hour,
but, certainly can vary in longer horizons.

than 100% average delay s when low state is increased to ∼ N (40, 60). When low state reduced to
∼ N (10, 10) and ∼ N (5, 5), impact decreases to approximately 5%. Note that probability of low impact
on designed network is about 5%. Any less than 95% will impact the CACC system even if speed distri-
bution is ∼ N (5, 5). Impact of diﬀerent levels of attacks on average delay, headway (f t), and speed can
also be seen from Figs. 14 as weight over higher values of delay, larger variation of headways, and higher
variation in average speed values.

7. Conclusions

In this paper, system level cyber attack risk and impact under connected vehicles framework using
Bayesian Networks is developed. From the developed BN models, risk probabilities and expected utilities
(impacts) are deduced for on-board equipment in cooperative adaptive cruise control and signal con-
trollers with and without redundant traﬃc surveillance systems. Impacts of propagated risks on CACC
and signalized traﬃc network applications are quantiﬁed via simulations in average speed, average and
maximum queue lengths, and delays which can result as incidents, energy loss, and higher emissions. For
CACC application, impact levels result as 50% delay diﬀerence when low amount of speed information
is perturbed. When a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent speed characteristics is inserted by an attacker. Delay goes
beyond 100%. At signalized networks with and without redundant systems, risk can increase average
queues and delays by 3% and 15% and 4% and 17% respectively. However, further improvements are
possible:

i Presented method can be used for attack modeling,
ii Expressing the systems as ﬂow network for possible attack paths in order to optimize sensor deploy-

ment and minimize communication delays,

iii Alternative CV market penetration incorporation can be included,
iv Developing detection models for possible attacks and mitigation eﬀorts.
