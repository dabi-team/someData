Abstract—Botnets continue to be an active threat against
ﬁrms or companies and individuals worldwide. Previous research
regarding botnets has unveiled information on how the system
and their stakeholders operate, but an insight on the economic
structure that supports these stakeholders is lacking. The
objective of this research is to analyse the business model and
determine the revenue stream of a botnet owner. We also study
the botnet life-cycle and determine the costs associated with it
on the basis of four case studies. We conclude that building a
full scale cyber army from scratch is very expensive where as
acquiring a previously developed botnet requires a little cost. We
ﬁnd that initial setup and monthly costs were minimal compared
to total revenue.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

Botnets and malware over the last couple of years have
proven to be a serious threat to cybersecurity. A botnet is
a network of various computers which can be controlled by
attackers. The controller of the network is called the botmaster.
It gives commands to the network by making use of various
communication channels. The malicious software used to
control this network of computers is known as malware.

It comes as no surprise that the primary motive for the use
of botnets is for economic gain [1]. Although some revenue
estimates are known and knowledge regarding the involved
actors is available, the structure of the revenue stream is still
unclear. In this article we try to provide an insight on the
revenue ﬂow, by making use of existing literature and four
different case studies.

The practitioners involved in the development botnet can be

divided in four tiers [2]:

2018, 26th Euromicro International conference on Parallel, Distributed, and
Network-Based Processing (PDP).

In this paper we use the Osterwalder Business Model
Canvas [13] framework to depict the “business” of developing,
starting and using a botnet as shown in Figure 2.

Osterwalder & Pigneur [13] propose nine building blocks
as the basis of a business model,
the logic of how a
company intends to generate proﬁt. The nine building blocks,
customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer
relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities,
key partnerships and cost structure each have their own core
questions that can be used to characterise every business.

Rodriguez-Gomez et al. [14] proposes are six stages a
botnet goes through in its life-cycle: conception, recruitment,
interaction, marketing, attack execution and attack success.

TABLE I: An overview of botnet case studies

Understanding the phases of the botnet life-cycle is essential
to estimate the costs involved.

1) The botnet life-cycle: The ﬁrst phase, conception, is all
about motivation: why does one want to setup a botnet? On this
subject, Rodriguez-Gomez et al. [14] argues that there are ﬁve
motives for a botmaster to setup a botnet. These are money,
entertainment, ego, cause and social status. Of these ﬁve it is
argued that the primary motive is ﬁnancial gain. This is usually
achieved by selling the source code of the botnet malware.
More common is renting out the botnet or its services. Booters
are an example of renting services based on botnets [15].

The second stage is the recruitment phase.

Infecting
computers (or paying others to infect computers for you) with
botnet malware resulting in the botmaster being able to control
the computer. Usually, larger the botnet the better it is, as the
power of a botnet is highly dependent on its size. Depending
on the size, renting a botnet for DDoS attacks can cost up to
several thousands of dollars a day.

Next, the botmaster can decide to use the botnet himself
or rent the services based on botnet. It often takes place by
making use of underground online marketplaces or forums,
which can be found and accessed via the dark web. In the
U.S., the law that prohibits the user to create a botnet (amongst
other fraudulent computer activities) is known as the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act [16]. Other countries have similar laws
in regard to fraudulent computer use, which include botnet use
and ownership.

Bottazzi et al. [1] states that spamming and DDoS-attacks
can be considered least proﬁtable among the activities
mentioned in Table I, since the operation is too noisy, this
stands in great contrast to the ﬁndings in Kanich et al. [5]
and the in Brunt et al. discussed vDos case. A summary of
previous ﬁndings on these cases can be found in Table I.

2) Actors

in the life-cycle: Bottazzi et al.

[1] has
deﬁned a botnet assembly chain, which has six stages
regarding activities varying from development to utilization.
Furthermore, this assembly chain is coupled with the level of
skill necessary to be able to successfully complete the activity
mentioned in the brick, and the “darkness” of the market it
is operating in. The latter indicates the level of illegality in
the actions performed by the user. Gosler et al. [2] propose a
similar division, however more based on the involved actors,
which he calls tiers. It has already been discussed in Section
I.

Fig. 3: Botnet Assembly Chain [1]

The ﬁrst stage of the botnet supply chain, R&D and
Money Transfers are arguably legal businesses. Research and
development involves the continuous search for exploits in
software,
the development of new malicious software and
selling knowledge of computer systems and software. The
actors behind this process are mostly IT professionals and offer
support, customize the software to the wishes of the customer
and operate alone or in groups. The actors in this stage of
development can be linked to tiers two, three and four in the
hierarchy proposed by Gosler et al. [2].

The third and fourth stage, C&C (command and control)
Bulletproof Hosting and PPI (Pay Per Install) distribution
operate in a more grey area regarding legality. Bulletproof
Hosting includes offering web-based storage for the botnet
end-user to store stolen information like banking credentials
or passwords on. The hosting service can also serve as the
server for the command and control centre of the botnet
master. The control centre can consist of one or multiple
computers, in the last case typically for redundancy purposes
[17]. Regarding PPI Distribution; many malware developers
do not have the resources to spread the malware they have
written to various computers across the world. At least not on
a signiﬁcant scale. To solve this problem they make use of the
so called PPI (pay-per-install) Distribution model. In essence
this involves the owner of the malware paying afﬁliates to
spread the malware, providing a commission to these malware
spreaders per infected device. The client making use of PPI
distribution to spread the malware usually collects the funds to
be able to afford this by selling regular botnet related services.
Taking a look at the tier-based hierarchy, it is likely that the
practitioners which are mentioned in tier 1 make use of the
PPI Distribution model. Caballero et al. [11] indicates the PPI
model is one of the most used ways of distributing malware.
Estimates are that, of the twenty most prevalent families of
malware, twelve made use of the PPI distribution model [18].

botnets, the ones who actually perform the attacks.

III. LIFE-CYCLE COST ANALYSIS

By identifying the various phases which occur in the
botnet’s life-cycle, it should now be possible to estimate the
costs involved in each step. In the following sections the
life-cycle has been split up in three phases. These steps,
acquiring malware, spreading and performing maintenance,
form the basis of building the botnet business.

A. Acquiring malware

For this calculation1, a study by Charlie Miller is taken
as the baseline [3]. According to his analysis a full scale
act of cybercrime aimed to break down great parts of digital
infrastructure of the U.S. will cost the attacker tens of millions
of dollars. This therefore indicates such an attack is only really
viable for large companies or government like institutions.
Furthermore, Miller estimates that planning the attack and
developing the malware takes at
least a couple of years
before it is actually usable. To be able to apply the data he
collected into the perspective of other countries we propose
the following:

• Weigh in the active amount of internet connections of a

certain country - (deﬁned as n) [19]

• Weigh in the ITU ICT Development Index (IDI), which
is (according to ITU) “used to monitor and compare
communication
developments
time”
technology (ICT) between countries and over
(deﬁned as i) [20]

information

and

in

• Set the active amount of internet connections and IDI

base level at the level of the United States.

This has resulted in the following equation:

× M iller(cid:48)s estimated costs

(1)

In order to apply this formula correctly, it is important that
both the number of active internet connections and the IDI are
estimated in the same year. The costs estimated by Miller have
been released in 2010. Unfortunately, we have not been able
to ﬁnd conclusive data regarding the IDI and the number of

connections from this year. Therefore, In this study, we make
use of data collected in 2015.

The above calculations in case of the Netherlands result in
an estimate of annual costs of $3.11 million to be able to
launch a full scale attack on the internet infrastructure of the
Netherlands. This calculation is, however, a very rough and
an unreliable estimate. Fixed and managerial costs should be
different (in case of Netherlands) than the ones deﬁned by
Miller. For example, spreading costs will most likely be a lot
less when compared to the U.S., simply because the amount
of devices is signiﬁcantly lower. Therefore, we propose to
apply the calculation above only on certain aspects of malware
development. We show these calculations in the case of three
different countries in Table II.

Harris et al. [21] argues that for “the true do it yourself
type” there are botnet malware how to guides available for
less than $600. This seems logical: the mentioned ZeuS and
Mirai botnet packages are already set up, but still need some
conﬁguration to get them running. The more expensive ZeuS
packages offer easier and more complete functionality.

B. Spreading the malware

In Miller’s case, if one would want to calculate the total
costs of malware, including spreading but excluding the use
and maintenance of the botnet, it should be possible to add
up $160k to the $16 million which is already accounted for.
In other cases, the average botmaster will most likely make
use of the earlier describe paid per install model. According to
Brian Krebs, making use of the PPI distribution model, costs
are estimated to vary from $7 to $180 per 1000 installations
[18]. As both researches have been conducted around the
it should be possible to compare these costs.
year 2011,
Taking the average of $93.5 per 1000 installations ($0.0935
per installation), and comparing this to the estimated $160k
spreading costs for an average EU country, with the PPI
distribution model it would be possible to infect over 1.7
million devices. The spreading costs in Miller’s report appear
to be more economical, at around $0,016 per infected device.

is
In the case the owner of
also the author of the malware code, he can resolve these
issues himself and release new revisions of his malware if
necessary. According to a Mirai based case study, maintenance
costs of desktop botnets exceeds the revenue generated by
DDoS attacks [4]. With the rise of IoT, a new target group
consisting of less secure devices like CCTV cameras has
risen. A botnet composed of these less secure devices may be
a lot cheaper to maintain even though it is ten times bigger.
The Mirai botnet makes use of these devices. Although the
malware can be cleared off an infected device by simply
rebooting it (as the malware is only stored on the device’s
RAM, which gets erased when rebooting) the same device
can most likely be re-infected almost immediately [22]. The
botmaster only has to keep a list of IP-addresses which have

been infected in the past, and scan if these IP-addresses are
still connected to the botnet.

Re-infection costs have been estimated at $0.0935 per
device. Furthermore, the malware creator has to constantly
innovate, as security updates are rolled out every day. Lastly,
in some cases the malware creator provides customer service
to his customers, which bought a malware package from
him. According to Miller, a level 1 malware developer earns
around $125k a year. Assuming the speciﬁc malware is being
developed and maintained by a level 1 developer, maintaining
the botnet costs the developer around $59 per hour. (Based
on 22 working days a month, working 8 hours a day). Let’s
apply these costs to the two botnet malware types:

ZeuS - As re-infection is impossible, the botmaster has to
rely on unpatched devices. If this is the case each infection
costs the estimated $0.0935. According to ZeuS tracker, the
average ZeuS binary antivirus detection rate lies around 40%.
Therefore, ﬁnding unpatched devices should not be a problem.
If the problem should arise new malware has to be developed,
this would cost
or the ZeuS malware has to be altered,
the developer the estimated $59 per hour. Assuming the
developer has a normal tax-paying 8 hour a day job besides
malware developing, 8 hours of sleep a day and some spare
the developer can spend around 4 hours a day on
time,
developing and/or maintenance. Over a year’s period, instead
of maintaining the botnet, the developer could have worked a
job which would have provided him around $62k. This will
be regarded as maintenance costs per year.

Mirai - As the owner of the infected device has very
little inﬂuence in making sure his/her device gets patched,
or requires at least some advanced computing knowledge to
do so, one can assume successful re-infection is more likely
to occur than not. Assuming the 2 year warranty period as
the minimum lifespan of the product, chances of the device
being replaced by a newer non vulnerable device (assuming
the device owner does not know his device has been infected)
seems negligible. This makes maintaining a Mirai botnet
much easier and cost efﬁcient, as each re-infection (if done
by making use of the PPI model) only costs the estimated
$0.0935. This is, however, all speculation as conclusive data
regarding the maintenance of Internet of Things botnets is
currently unavailable.

Depending on the intended use of the botnet, it can now
be used or marketed to rent it out. In both cases the botnet is
being run from one or multiple command and control centres,
which are basically computers which run the software used to
control the botnet. Controlling the botnet costs time, of which
the costs per hour have been set at $59 in the previous section.
Marketing and selling the botnet costs little to no money.

Summarizing, the total setup costs for a ZeuS or Mirai based
botnet can be found in Table III. All numbers are on annual
basis, except of malware package and spreading costs.

occur in the life-cycle.

A. Cost-beneﬁt analysis

While the analysis in Section III-C focuses on ZeuS and
Mirai, the analysis that follows is activity based. The four main
botnet related activities, DDoS attacks, spamming, bank fraud
and click fraud are linked to a speciﬁc type of malware. For
example, as explained before, Mirai is only suitable for DDoS
attacks [26]. A detailed overview of the researched cases can
be found in Table IV.

Since initial costs vary little between each case compared
to the potential proﬁts, it is no wonder spreaders and hosting
providers take a signiﬁcant part of DDoS revenue. Around
25% of total revenue per month to be precise, assuming every
bot has to be re-infected every month. A signiﬁcant part,
especially when compared to the maximum of 1.1% of hosting
and spreading costs of the other three cases. Hosting could be
seen as a viable business, as it brings relatively low risk with
it. Spreading, however, brings great risks as it is demonstrable
punishable by law. The costs that have to be made to setup a
botnet are in most cases insigniﬁcant. It seems, however, the
real winners are the money handlers.

B. Economic impact on organisations

Information regarding the overall economic impact of botnet
attacks on various institutions is scarce. A possible cause for
this could be that it is hard to estimate the economic impact:
it is not always known which institutions are affected, and
economic impact is more often than not an indirect impact
[27, 28].

A 2011 report of intelligence provider Detica on the impact
of cybercrime on U.K. based institutions deﬁnes four types of
costs associated with cybercrime: costs in anticipation of, costs
as a consequence of, costs in response to and indirect costs
associated with cybercrime [29]. Regarding direct and indirect
impact, Anderson et al. elaborates on the aspects mentioned
above, and give a few examples, based on bank fraud [30].
Table V describes for each type of attack the subsequent costs
for the target company.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we present the botnet business model with the
help of the canvas proposed by Osterwalder and Pigneur[13].
We then discuss the stages and actors involved in a botnet
life cycle in Section II and analyse the life cycle costs of a
botnet in Section III. Finally, in Section IV we perform a cost
beneﬁt analysis from the view point of an attacker on the basis
of four case studies and discuss the ﬁnancial impact of botnets
on organisations. We draw the following conclusions from our
analysis:

• By making use of readily available malware packages and
outsourcing malware infection, it is possible to set up a
proﬁtable botnet business within days.

• Initial investment costs on acquiring malware, spreading,
like hosting and

combined with recurring costs
transaction fees, are nearly insigniﬁcant.

– In three out of four researched cases, set-up costs
accounted for a maximum of 1.1% of monthly
revenue.
