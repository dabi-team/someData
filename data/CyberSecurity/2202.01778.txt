Abstract—The  increasing  critical  dependencies  on  Internet-
of-Things (IoT) have raised security concerns; its application on 
the  critical  infrastructures  (CIs)  for  power  generation  has  come 
under massive cyber-attack over the years. Prior research efforts 
to  understand  cybersecurity  from  Cyber  Situational  Awareness 
(CSA)  perspective  fail  to  critically  consider  the  various  Cyber 
Situational  Awareness  (CSA)  security  vulnerabilities  from  a 
human  behavioural  perspective  in  line  with  the  CI.  This  study 
evaluates  CSA  elements  to  predict  cyber-attacks  in  the  power 
generation  sector.  Data  for  this  research  article  was  collected 
from  IPPs  using  the  survey  method.  The  analysis  method  was 
employed  through  Partial  Least  Squares  Structural  Equation 
Modeling  (PLS-SEM)  to  assess  the  proposed  model.  The  results 
revealed  negative  effects  on  people  and  cyber-attack,  but 
significant  in  predicting  cyber-attacks.  The  study  also  indicated 
that information handling is significant and positively influences 
cyber-attack. The study also reveals no mediation effect between 
the  association  of  People  and  Attack  and  Information  and 
Attack.  It  could  result  from  an  effective  cyber  security  control 
implemented by the IPPs. Finally, the study also shows no sign of 
network  infrastructure  cyber-attack  predictions.  The  reasons 
could be because managers of IPPs had adequate access policies 
and security measures in place.

INTRODUCTION 

The  massive  application  of  IoT  on  the  electrical  grid 
opened  up  a  huge  opportunity  to  utilize  previously  untapped 
processing  power  to  offload  custom  applications  directly  to 
other  devices.  These  transformations  are  not  achievable 
without experiencing some form of security vulnerabilities on 
the  grid  ([1],  [2]),  even  though  deploying  these  business 
applications on the grid will increase the overall robustness of 
the grid and reduce communication overhead. A recent attack 
in 2016 on the Ukrainian power grid was an advanced form 
of  hacking  the  CI  by  the  Russians  extending  their  intrusion 
to  increase  control  using  the  “Crash  Override”.  A  related 
attack occurred in March 2016, compromising the command-
and-control  (C&C)  system  on  the  New  York  Dam  with  a 
cellular  phone.  The  Stuxnet  attack  also  created  awareness  of 
potential  cyber  threats  on  power  generation  companies[3], 
impacting  the  grid's  reliability  [4].  According  to  [5],  various 

forms  of  cyber-attack  concerning  the  grid  are  man-made 
manipulation.  Raikuma,  et  al  [6],  have  indicated  the  need  to 
avoid  such  incidents  due  to  the  ripple  effects  of  a  power 
system  shutdown.  The  growing  investment  of  human  capital 
and  financial  resources  injected  into  CI  protection  shows  the 
extent to which industry players and the research community 
understand  CI  challenges.  The  increased  investment  in  the 
sector  calls  for  the  need  to  evaluate  cyber  situational 
awareness  (CSA)  from  a  human  behaviour  perspective  since 
the critical infrastructure (CI) falls within a dynamic changing 
environment. CSA can assist in comprehensively investigating 
an approach to the ongoing debates relating to cyber security. 
Cyber  awareness  for  cyber  defence  generally  requires 
perception,  understanding  and  projection.  CSA  creates  room 
for predictions in line with an action sequence and effectively 
plans for new cyber-attacks trends. Hence, the need to identify 
activities of interest to maintain awareness of a new paradigm 
in  cyber  defence.  According  to  Franke  and  Brynielsson  [7], 
CSA is comparable to insider informants leaking information 
on an imminent attack. Prior studies had also revealed a range 
of  cyber  incidents  stemming  from  minor  employee  mistakes, 
misinformation  on  controls,  and  highly  coordinated,  well-
planned  attack  on  the  critical  infrastructure  ([1],  [8]–[10]). 
Johnson and Banfield [11] revealed that current cybersecurity 
the  sophistication  of  embedded 
defences  cannot  match 
technologies  attacks  capabilities.  Hence,  the  need  to  evaluate 
cyber  situational  awareness  (CSA)  from  human  behaviours 
perspective  to  predict,  detect,  and  prevent  cyber-attack 
vulnerabilities  in  a  dynamic  power  generation  environment. 
The  concept  of  cyber  situational  awareness  can  be  situated 
based  on  the  insight  of  individual  abilities  to  distinguish  and 
assess  current  and  future  effects  in  terms  of  how  situations 
evolve  from  an  attacker's  perspective  to  understand  and 
restrict cyber vulnerabilities [12]. Prior research has made an 
immense  contribution  in  applying  various  technologies  to 
support  critical  cyber  incidents.  Yet,  today's  cybersecurity 
challenges  in  the  power  generation  sector  are  increasing  and 
becoming  more  sophisticated  and  alarming  than  we  think  in 
the  power  sector  ([5],  [13],  [14]).  The  introduction  of 
intelligent  information  technology  equipment  such  as  the 
Internet  of  things  (IoT)  devices  and  other  industrial  control 
systems  (ICS)  enabled  the  power  generation  grid  to  become 
more effective and intelligent ([3], [15], [16]). Fig. 1 depicts a 
visual  overview  of  a  possible  cyber-attack  on  the  generation 
and distribution section of the power grid.

II.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

A.  Theoretical Review 

Endsley [18] gave three (3) levels of indication to assist in 
forming  a  mental  model  of  having  a  more  comprehensive 
view of an operational environment, as shown in Fig. 2. 

In our effort to evaluate cyber situational awareness from 
human behaviour in an IPPs environment, the authors consider 
the  base  of  the  variable  in  the  conceptual  framework  in  line 
with the considerations in Table I and Fig. 3.

In  2019  the  Worldwide  Threat  Assessment  by  the  U.S. 
indicated 
insiders  pose 
significant  cyber  threats  to  the  grid.  According  to  [19],  a 
variation of threat actors pose substantial cybersecurity threats 
to  the  electric  grid;  these  actors  support  grid  operations. 
Ramamurthy  and  Jain  [16]  also  indicated  the  difficulty  in 
managing the workforce transformation, which is likely to be 
the  most  worrying  complication  of  IoT  implementations. 
Cyberattacks  at  varying  levels  of  criticality  on  nations 
businesses  and  organizations  with  an  internet  presence 
primarily  contribute  to  human-centric  activities  [20].  Some 
persons may work as a team to make decisions and carry out 
actions [18]. In the work of [21], i

who  have  hatefulness  for  other  consumers  or  the  service

providers  also  contribute
seeking  to  evaluate  the  vulnerabilities.  These  factors  are 
considered  based  on  social  networking,  operating  procedure 
maintenance,  and  security-related 
issues,  such  as  user 
elicitation  of  information  on  cyber  threats  on  CI  networks, 
interactions  challenges  concerning  user 
person-to-person 
control,  and  whether  or  not  users  strictly  adhere  to  cyber 
security  protocols.  Based  on  the  preceding,  we  propose  the 
following hypothesis.

D.  Network 

The communication network and the electrical grid play a 
significant role in generating and transmitting power to either 
a  sub-station  or  a  customer.  Hence,  identifying  various 
network  vulnerabilities  impact  assessments  will  provide 
knowledge  of  future  impact  projection.  Prior  studies  have 
discussed  different  techniques  to  improve  cyber  situational 
awareness  [7],  [24],  [25],  mainly  for  analyzing  the  trends  in 
network traffic. With the evolution of grid networks, there are 
increasing  security  threats  due  to  the  expanding  volume 
of data  transmitted  on  the  grid.  Some  of  these  specific  cyber 
incidents  on  the  grid  network,  as  indicated  by  ([26]–[28])  in 
their  recent  study.  Because  Cyber  situation  awareness 
empowers cybersecurity experts to detect and fully understand 
and anticipate incoming threats, however, our thorough review 
of  the  literature  revealed  no  previous  studies  on  how  the 
human  behavioural  concept  can  apply  in  this  context.  To 
assess  cyber  situational  awareness  of  the  grid  network 
vulnerabilities  and  how  these  vulnerabilities  can  influence 
cyber-attacks.  Per  these  constructs,  our  goal  is  to  evaluate 

vulnerabilities and their implications for the grid. Concerning 
the  measurement  of  network  vulnerabilities  from  a  human 
behavioural perspective, authors seek to: 

•  Enquire whether or not individuals can access the grid 

network with their devices. 

•  Find  evidence  of  unauthorized  persons  accessing  the 

grid network remotely. 

•  Find  the  frequency  of  change  of  network  access 

policies. 

•  Enquire  if  there  is  evidence  of  unauthorized  IT  staff 

accessing the network remotely. 

•  Finally,  enquire  if  users  can  access  social  media 

applications on the network.

positively influence cyber-attacks. 

E.  Cyber Situational Awareness 

the  entire  power  generation  system 

The  military  is  where  situational  awareness  first  appears. 
Situational  awareness  aims 
identify  events,  causes, 
to 
consequences, and future projections [18]. It also considers the 
status  and  attributes  of  elements  by  assessing  the  present 
situation  and  predicting  future  outcomes  based  on  previous 
understanding  and  acquaintance  [29].  It  becomes  possible 
through  the  acquisition  of  data,  conception,  and  synthesis  to 
enable decision-makers to resolve problems with the massive 
deployment of IoT devices in the power generation sector; for 
data, acquisition to continuously monitor various sub-systems 
Infrastructure. 
of 
Therefore,  Cyber  Situation  Awareness 
(CSA)  extends 
Situation  Awareness  (SA)  to  the  power  generation  cyber 
domain. Hence, we can access fist hand information and seek 
indications  from  an  attacker’s  perspective,  estimate  the 
impact,  to  anticipate  their  actions.  Research  has  carefully 
refined  cyber  situational  awareness  predominantly  in  the  CI 
([22], [30], [31]). However, a careful study of the literature did 
not  reveal  any  prior  studies  investigating  how  the  Cyber 
Situation  Awareness  elements  (people,  information,  and 
networks) concept can apply in human behaviours from IPPs 
operational environment. Because according to Michael, et al 
[32],  CSA  is  the  degree  to  which  individuals  within  a  team 
possess the CSA required in carrying out their responsibilities. 
We  believe  cyber  vulnerabilities  could  occur  due  to  various 
duties  discharged  by  the  operational  staff  of  IPPs  hence, 
evaluating  human  behaviours  in  the  power  generation  sector. 
These vulnerabilities  can  occur  in  any  of  the  layers;  physical 
layer, information layer, and the human layers in the CI [33].

generation  unit.  Memories  of  a  cyber  attack  in  New  York  in 
March  2016  affected  the  Dam  control  system  with  a  cellular 
modem.  Such  attacks  can  lead  to  incapacitating  the  practical 
function  of  the  electric  grid  in  line  with  communication 
between systems or equipment on the grid network ([8], [15], 
[35]). It can also harm the effective grid functioning ([1], [36], 
[37]).  Recent  studies  in  the  area  reveal  various  cyber-attacks 
such as False data injection attacks ([27], [38], [39]), Denial-
of-service  attacks    identified  by  ([40],  [41]),  Distributed 
Denial of Service attack indicated by [42], Man-in-the-middle 
attack  [6],  Malware  Attack  by  ([43],  [44]),  State  Estimation 
attack  [45],  and  Price  manipulation  and  Misrepresentation  of 
values attack[1] Coordinated ([10], [43]), etc. 

G.  Related Work 

The  new  paradigm  of  human-centric  warfare  on 
cybersecurity  is  wealth  looking  into  because  insider  threats 
can  be  disruptive  and  equally  malicious  as  an  attack  from 
outside  an  organization  [20].  Cyber  situational  awareness 
gives  insight  into  understanding  an  impending  phenomenon 
[46].  Since  many  sectors  in  the  economy  are  primarily 
dependent  on  Critical 
infrastructures  (CI)  [11],  where 
information  is  sent  and  received  for  processing  to  predict 
possible  future  threats  and  adequately  plan  the  power 
generation  environment.  According  to  Nekha  and  Dorosh 
[23],  the  critical  aspect  of  cyber  situational  awareness  can 
timely  deal  with  an  emerging  threat  model.  Hence,  critically 
examine  elements  such  as  people,  information,  and  networks 
in  the  context  of  cyber  situational  awareness  within  the 
operational  environment  of  the  independent  power  producers 
(IPPs)  in  perspective.  The  growing  adoption  of  high  IoT 
devices  connected  to  the  Internet  and  the  use  of  the  global 
positioning system to harmonize grid operations contributes to 
grid  vulnerabilities  [19].  Current  studies  in  the  sectors  focus 
on  the  cyber-physical  aspect  of  the  grid;  [47]  examine  the 
multi-stage  attacks  using  WannaCry  ransomware.  The  study 
of [48] accesses the vulnerability with the local power trading. 
Sharafeev et al [1] develop an algorithm to monitor electrical 
power  systems  (EPS)  cyber-attacks.  A  framework  for 
assessing  critical  infrastructure  in  an  attack  was  created  by 
Akhtar, et al [49]. Sarangan, et al [50] Analyzed cyber-attacks 
of  the  power  grid  in  considering  the  ill-effects  of  increasing 
renewable  penetration  [39].  Develop  a  systematic  two-stage 
approach  for  detecting  false  data  injection  (FDI).  Roy  and 
Debbarma  [27]  also  Proposed  a  cyber-attack  detection  and 
mitigation platform which uses forecasted data. Raikuma, et al 
[6]  also  demonstrate  the  impact  of  the  man-in-the-middle 
attack,  which  exploits  vulnerabilities  in  the  Generic  Object-
Oriented  Substation  Event  (GOOSE).  Prior  related  research 
work was sort of giving indications of lack of effort to explore

vulnerabilities 
particularly, in the power generation sector. Hence our current 
study  seeks  to  critically  evaluate  and  access  the  cyber 
vulnerabilities  within 
the  IPPs  using  cyber  situational 
awareness. 

from  Human  Behavioral 

Based  on  the  above  reviews,  we  propose  five  (5) 

hypotheses, as follows:

Based  on  the  above  research  hypotheses,  the  influence  of 
cyber  situational  awareness  on  People,  Information,  and 
Network cyberattacks is present in Fig. 4. 

III.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY 

A.  Research Design 

The  approach  of  our  current  study  is  purely  quantitative. 
We sort to use this approach because it involves an empirical 
investigation of the social phenomena of Cyber Attacks from 
Human  Behavioral  in  the  context  of  the  IPPs.  Therefore,  the 
employs  quantitative  data  using  the  survey  method  to  collect 
and gather the information required for the analysis. 

B.  Data Collection 

Questionnaires were administered purposively to a sample 
of selected units of the IPPs staff who are directly involved in 
the  organization's  day-to-day  grid  operations  from  March  to 
May 2021. We sort to use questionnaire because of anonymity 
among  respondents  and 
implication.  The 
its 
questionnaire  consists  of  four  (4)  parts:  Demographic  factor, 
People, Information, and Network. The questionnaire design is 
founded  on  [51]  conceptual  framework  using  a  Likert  scale 
from  (One)1  for  strongly  disagree  to  (Five)  5  for  strongly 
agree.

C.  Population and Sampling Procedures 

The  population  studied  is  GRIDco  and  five  (5)  IPPs  in 
Ghana  that  is  actively  operating  with  GRIDco  in  the  power 
generation sector to assess Cyber Attacks on the electrical grid 
from  human  behaviour  in  context.  Our  estimated  sample 
frame  is  300,  based  on  the  various  units  within  the  IPPs: 
Supervisory  Control  and  Data  Acquisition  (SCADA)  Unit, 
Telecommunication  Unit,  and  the  Management  Information 
Systems  (MIS).  The  sampling  method  employed  was 
probability sampling (random sampling). Choice of employees 
was at random within the various IPPs units selected to answer 
the questions

IV.  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS 
The  PLS-SEM  approach  seeks  to  support  evaluating 
patterns  of  causality  of  target  constructs  in  the  structural 
model.  It  also  provides  more  detailed  statistical  associations 
in  a  model.  Authors’

employees’  PLS-SEM  in  the  study  since  it  allows  relatively 
more minor samples than other statistical software like Amos 
and Lisrel.  PLS-SEM does  not  enforce  stringent  assumptions 
on data distribution [52]. 238 is the valid responses received, 
which  forms  the  basis  of  data  analysis;  86.1%  were  males, 
while 13.9% were from females (see Table 2) on demographic 
of  respondents.  Using  the  two-step  approach  to  evaluating 
structural  equation  models  as  suggested  by  [53],  we  began 
examining  the  measurement  model  to  assess  the  instrument's 
reliability and validity. We then looked at the structural model 
based on the hypotheses proposed in this study. 

A.  Measurement Model 

Following  our  measurement  model  assessment,  we 
identified  four(4)  items  (AK2,  C5,  C6,  and  C15)  is  removed 
from the study as a result of their low loadings, which is less 
than  0.600as  recommended  by  ([54],  [55]).  In  assessing  the 
reliability  of  the  constructs  for  our  measurement  Models,  we 
used  Cronbach’s  alpha  and  composite  reliability  measures  to 
test the model's internal consistency. Hence Cronbach’s alpha 
and  composite  reliability  for  each  construct  are  adequate,  as 
indicated  in  Table  III.  Composite  reliability  should be higher 
than  0.6  and  0.70  ([56]–[58]).  With  indicator  factor  loadings 
surpassing  0.5,  Nunnally 
[59] 
recommended  that  the  Average  Variance  Extracted  for  each 
variable  should  exceed  0.5  [56]  to  assess  convergent  validity 
[59]. Indications of convergent instrument validity are present 

[58]  and  Hair,  et  al 

Additionally,  the  loadings  of  each  indicator  should  be 
greater  than  all  its  cross-loadings  [53].  An  inspection  of 
indicator  cross-loadings  in  Table  III  shows  that  all  indicators 
load  their  highest  on  their  respective  construct.  No  Indicator 
loads higher on other constructs than on its intended construct. 
Evident in Table 4 shows that the square root of the AVEs for 
each  construct  is  greater  than  the  cross-correlation  for 
different  constructs.  Based  on  these  results  is  the  established 
discriminant  validity  of  the  instrument.  We  also  measured 
Discriminant validity using the Heterotrait-Monotrait Ratio of 
correlation(HTMT) criterion by [61], [62], see Table V below.

B.  Structural Model 

In  this  section,  overall  explanatory  power,  Amount  of 
variance explained by the independent variables, the degree of 
strength  of  each  path 
is  assessed.  To  estimate  path 
significance, we applied bootstrap. We also assess the quality 
of  the  structural  model  with  the  coefficient  of  determination 
(R2) and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) ([63] 
[64]).  Our  structural  model  results  are  present  in  Fig.  5  and 
Table  6.  Regarding  our  (H1),  The  result  shows  even  though 
people  have  a  negative  influence  in  predicting  cyber-attack 
plays  a  significant  role  for  an  attack  to  occur  (β  =  -0.435;  p 
=0.000).  (H1.1)  However,  the  mediation  effect  of  network 
activities  from  people  to  attack  does  not  have  a  negative 
relationship and plays no significant role in predicting cyber-
attack within the grid. (β = -0.008; p =0.643). (H2) our results 
reveal  that  information  handling  is  significant  and  positively 
influences cyber-attack predictions within the grid. (β = 0.296; 
p=0.020). Meanwhile, (H2.1) information handling positively 
affects  network  activities  within  the  grid  and  significantly 
influences  cyber-attacks  (β  =  -0.949;  p  =0.000).  (H3)  was 
found  to  have  network  activities  positively  affect  predicting 
cyber-attack but not significant (β = 0.123; p =0.300). Hence 
in  this  study,  we  did  not  find  support  for  H3  and  H1.1,  as 
indicated  in  table  6  below.  According  to  [62],  the  predictive 
validity  of  variance  is  a  criterion  for  determining  a  model's 
prediction  accuracy.  Hence  the  coefficient  of  determination 
(R2) is the output of regression value as variance proportion in 
endogenous  variable  predicted  by  exogenous  variable. 

R2 values range from 0 to 1; A higher value is said to have a 
higher  level  of  R2  of  .75  is  substantial,  .50  is  moderate,  and 
.25 is considered as weak ([65], [66]). 

This  study  shows  Attack  (0.396,  being  Moderate)  and 
Network with (0.901, substantial) value. In conclusion, the R2 
indicates a sufficient level of R2 (see Table VI) and Fig. 5. 

The  authors  performed  analysis  to  assess  the  mediation 
role  of  the  Network  between  People  and  Attack.  The  study 
results in (Table VII) reveal that the total effect of People on 
Attacks, even though negative is significant (H1.1: β = -0.436, 
p=  0.000).  With  the  introduction  of  the  mediator  variable 
Network, the impact of People on Attack gives negative effect 
but  significant  (β  =  -0435,  p=0.000).  The  indirect  impact  of 
people  on  Attacks  through  networks  is  insignificant  (β  = 
0.116, p=0.318), which indicates no mediations effect between 
the association of People and attacks. 

introducing 

Finally,  assessing  the  mediation  role  of  the  Network 
between  Information  and  Attack.  Our  results  in  (Table  VII) 
also show that the total effect of Information on Attacks has a 
positive impact and is significant (H2.1: β = 0.413, p=0.000). 
By 
the 
information effect on the Attack shows a positive impact and 
is  significant  (β  =  0.296,  p=0.022).  The  indirect  implications 
of  Information  on  Attacks  through  networks  have  a  positive 
effect  and  are  insignificant  (β  =  -0.001,  p=  0.768),  which 
indicates  no  mediations  effect  between  the  association  of 
Information and Attack.

Finally,  steps  must  be  taken  to  monitor  users'  grid  activities

VI.  CONCLUSION 
Over  the  years,  the  power  generation  and  distribution 
sectors  have  seen  an  increase  in  the  number  of  independent 
power  producers  in  the  electricity  market.  This  sector  of 
power  generation  has  advanced  its  operations  with  the 
intervention  of  internet  of  things  (IoT)  technology  and  other 
electronic  equipment  making 
the  entire  grid  network 
susceptible  to  attack  [1],  [67],  [68].  From  the  literature 
perspective,  very  little  is  known  about  user  behaviour 
concerning  cyber  vulnerabilities  in  the  sector.  Bradley  [69] 
insider  threats  are  the  most  expensive  threats  challenging  to 
address  threats  to  people,  information,  and  technology  in  the 
business  environment.  In  this  regard,  our  research  helps  to 
improve the understanding of user behaviour in the context of 
Ghana’s  electricity  generation  sector.  From  the  context  of 
cyber situational awareness (CSA), authors sort to (1) evaluate

V.  IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY 
CSA  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  appropriateness  of 
concerted  decision-making  concerning  the  protection  of  the 
electrical  grid.  Invalidating  our  hypothesis,  although  (H1) 
posited there is a negative effect of people in predicting cyber-
attack, it also plays a significant role for an attack to occur in 
the  operational  environment  of  the  IPPs.  Therefore,  consider

vulnerabilities that contribute to cyber-attack on the electrical 
grid.  Our  findings  show  that  People's  construct  negatively 
predicts  cyber-attack  but  plays  a  significant  role  in  attacking 
the  electrical  grid.  The  authors  also  realized  no  mediation 
effect  from  people  and  attack  network  activities,  probably 
because  of  constant  security  controls  measures  such  as 
frequent  update  network  access  policies.  Meanwhile,  authors 
also  realized  that  information  handling  is  significant  and 
positively  influences  cyber-attack,  which  calls  for  well-
coordinated  cyber  security  controls  on  the  grid  activities  in 
line  with  confidential  and  sensitive  information  in  the 
operational  environment  of  IPPs.  In  addition,  there  was  no 
indication  of  mediations  effect  from  network  activities 
between  the  association  of  Information  and  Attack.  Such 
development  can  be  to  adequate  security  measures  being  put 
in  place  to  ensure  information  from  the  grid  are  received 
devoid  of  errors.  Finally,  managers  of  IPPs  infrastructure 
networks seem to have suitable security measures concerning 
the  network  activities.  Hence  irrespective  of  the  numerous 
activities  on  the  network  cannot  easily  translate  into  any 
negative cyber-attack impact on the grid network.
