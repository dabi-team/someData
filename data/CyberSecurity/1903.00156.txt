ABSTRACT
The deep and darkweb (d2web) refers to limited access web sites
that require registration, authentication, or more complex encryp-
tion protocols to access them. These web sites serve as hubs for a
variety of illicit activities: to trade drugs, stolen user credentials,
hacking tools, and to coordinate attacks and manipulation cam-
paigns. Despite its importance to cyber crime, the d2web has not
been systematically investigated. In this paper, we study a large
corpus of messages posted to 80 d2web forums over a period of
more than a year. We identify topics of discussion using LDA and
use a non-parametric HMM to model the evolution of topics across
forums. Then, we examine the dynamic patterns of discussion and
identify forums with similar patterns. We show that our approach
surfaces hidden similarities across different forums and can help
identify anomalous events in this rich, heterogeneous data.

1 INTRODUCTION
The web that most people are familiar with—the open and search-
able internet of social media sites, online merchants, newspapers
and the like—represents just a tiny fraction of the internet. Much
larger portions of internet data remain buried within the “deep-
web” [18], a term that refers to private corporate intranets and
databases, dynamically-generated web pages, and limited access
content, such as online academic journals. While only some of the
content is hidden behind encrypted protocols in .onion domains,

access to the remaining “open” content is generally restricted, re-
quiring registration and authentication [26]. Some portion of the
deepweb, also known as the “darkweb,” serves as a hub for all kinds
of illicit activities. Malicious actors congregate virtually on dark
web forums and marketplaces to trade illicit information, goods
and services, including ransomware, exploits, hacking tools, stolen
media, user credentials, fake ids, prescription medicines and ille-
gal drugs. In addition to serving as a marketplace for these goods,
the deep and dark web provides a venue for malicious actors to
coordinate cyber attacks [25] and terrorist activity [7]. The grow-
ing popularity of the marketplaces within the deepweb can be
attributed to the elimination of the risk of violence since there is
limited, if any, physical interaction between the buyers and the sell-
ers. Another reason is the use of encrypted protocols to preserve
anonymity, encouraging people to express themselves without the
risk of getting caught by law enforcement nor being censored by
the moderators of a web site [27].

Given the threat posed by these malicious actors, observing their
activities on the deep and dark web (d2web) may provide valuable
clues both for anticipating and preventing cyber attacks as well as
mitigating the fallout from data breaches. However, picking out
useful signals in the vast, dynamic and heterogeneous environment
of the d2web can be challenging.

In this paper, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5] to
analyze a large heterogeneous text corpus from the d2web. To un-
derstand the dynamics of discussions, we use a non-parametric
hidden Markov model [10]—the Beta Process HMM. In this approach
every forum is represented as a multivariate time series, where
variables are the topics found by LDA, and is fed into a Beta Pro-
cess HMM (BP-HMM). This BP-HMM then finds the shared states
among forums, where each state is a distribution over topics. This
helps track discussions on different forums and identify anomalous
behavior or important events. This approach can also be used to
find forums relevant to a specific subject, i.e., forums or time pe-
riods within forums where users discuss specific topics, such as
hacking techniques and cyber security related issues. This method
can also cluster forums into meaningful groups.

We test this framework on data consisting of posts published on
80 D2web forums from 2016 to mid 2017, on topics such as exploits
and hacking techniques, selling prescription and non-prescription
drugs, and creating fake ids. Overall this paper makes the following
contributions:

• Using LDA, we characterize the content of 80 d2web forums

where illicit activities are discussed.

• We describe an application of a non-parametric HMM model
to learn the forum’s shared topic dynamics based on the
results obtained from LDA.

• We use the learned shared behaviors as a compact represen-
tation of these time series to cluster forums into groups with

 
 
 
 
 
 
distinct characteristics and analyze learned latent behavioral
structures to gain more insight into this data.

• We rank forums based on how their topics of discussions are

likely to change.

• Finally, we present case studies revealing how our approach
can be used to to identify anomalous activity in d2web data.

2 RELATED WORK
For an overview of the darkweb and deepweb and the challenges
these sites pose for researchers and for law enforcement, please
see [11, 18]. Researchers have leveraged d2web content in specific
applications, but to the best of our knowledge, few have attempted
to systematically characterize the topics and dynamics of d2web
discussions. For example, Xu et al. [31] analyzed the topology and
structure of darkweb networks. Soska et al. [27] analyzed 16 dif-
ferent marketplaces to extract information on goods being sold
and money transactions, then trained classifiers on them. Tavabi
et al. [28] and Almukaynizi et al. [2] used features from d2web
discussions to predict which new vulnerability will be exploited.
Goyal et al. [13] and Deb et al. [8] used the frequency of important
cyber security-related keywords and the sentiment of d2web posts
respectively to predict cyber attacks. Along similar lines, [6] uti-
lized sentiment to analyze communications of extremists on the
darkweb and [1] developed a bilingual (English and Arabic) senti-
ment analysis lexicon for cyber security and radicalism on darkweb
forums.

In this paper we propose a statistical approach to analyze discus-
sions of multiple malicious forums by extracting their similarities
and their differences through learning hidden Markov models on
topic weights obtained from LDA. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
proposed by Blei et al. [5] is a powerful ubiquitous tool which al-
lows documents to be explained by latent topics. LDA has shown
to be effective in the analysis of the darkweb [19, 24]. However,
the dynamics of darkweb topics, which can give deeper insight
into this data, has not been analyzed previously. Rios et al. [24]
used LDA to detect overlapping communities in the darkweb and
L’huillier et al. [19] applied LDA to extract key members in dark-
web forums. Extensions to LDA, like Dynamic Topic Models [4],
have been designed to model evolution of topics across time. How-
ever, such models have strong memory requirements making them
impractical for a large heterogeneous corpus like the d2web. An
alternative approach is performing LDA on the entire corpus and ob-
serving fluctuation of weights across time, similar to approaches set
forth by [20, 30] and many others. Variants of LDA which combine
Hidden Markov Models have also been proposed. The approach
proposed by Griffiths et al. [14] models both semantic and syntac-
tic dependencies of documents by defining one state in HMM as
the semantic state modeled by LDA and other states as syntactic
components. Gruber et al. [15] modeled the relationship between
words in a document with an HMM. Their model assumes words in
the same sentence have the same topic, and successive sentences
are more likely to have the same topics, where in the original LDA
paper words in a document are assumed to be independent and
documents are modeled as bag of words. These variations were
proposed to better capture LDA topics, although Hidden Markov
models can also be used to identify shifts and variations in the

topics discussed, which is the approach of this work. HMM states
can help us recognize important events and anomalies.

3 METHODS
3.1 D2Web Data Collection
The d2web data we use in the study was collected using the crawl-
ing infrastructure described in [22, 25]. This crawling infrastructure
uses anonymization protocols, such as Tor and I2P, to access dark-
web sites, and handles authentication to access non-indexed deep-
web sites on the Internet. The infrastructure includes lightweight
crawlers and parsers that are focused on specific sites related to
malicious hacking and/or online financial fraud. These sites rep-
resent forums and discussion boards where people mostly discuss
cyber crime and fraud, although other illicit activities are discussed
as well, such as the sale of drugs and other stolen goods. There are
also a handful of forums crawled that are on the clearnet but which
are mostly white hat (i.e., involved with ethical hacking and/or pro-
fessional cybersecurity). We include these forums in our analysis
primarily to help identify other forums that might discuss similar
topics. In all, crawlers scraped data from over 250 d2web forums.
The most common languages in which the posts were written were
English (accounting for 37.8% of all posts), Russian (22.4% of all
posts), and Chinese (15.4% of all posts). Other languages, such as
Spanish, Arabic, and Turkish were less frequent, each accounting
for less than 7% of the posts. For this analysis we only focus on
English posts, though the same structure could be used for multiple
languages. Filtering out the non-English posts brings the number
of forums down to 155. We pre-processed the posts using NLTK [3],
SpaCy [17], and scikit-learn to remove stopwords, tokenize each
post, and filter tokens by post frequency to remove frequent words.
This gives us a corpus of 1.33 million posts.

3.2 Modeling Topics of Discussion
We applied a popular statistical technique known as Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) [5] to learn the topics of the English-language
posts. LDA is used to decompose documents into latent topics,
where each topic is a distribution over words, intended to capture
the semantic content of documents. In this model each document

Figure 2: Illustration of the model. Left image is matrix F .
Based on this matrix time series 1 exhibits states A,B and C
but doesn’t exhibit state D. The right image shows segmen-
tation of time series with hidden states

is treated as a bag-of-words. Once we learn the model we can
represent documents as distributions over a fixed number of topics.
Doing so gives us low-dimensional representations of documents.
In this paper we use the Gensim implementation of LDA [23]
to learn a model with 100 topics. We train the model on all 1.33
million documents to learn the most informative topics. We tested
with 50, 100, and 200 topics respectively, and found that 100 topics
results in the most coherent and relevant topics. To examine the
dynamics, we focused on time period of 2016 until mid September
2017 which has the best coverage in our data. We only looked at
forums with at least one month of activity and more than 100 posts
overall, which reduced our data set to 80 forums (and approximately
482 thousand posts). Figure 1 shows the level of activity in these 80
forums. The activity is highly heterogeneous, with some forums
seeing hundreds of posts weekly, and other forums showing little
activity.

3.3 Modeling Dynamics of Activity
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used extensively in mod-
eling dynamic processes and time series in a variety of applications.
These generative models segment time series into a predefined
number of latent states and learn transition rates between them.

When modeling multiple dynamic processes with HMMs, it is
useful to represent them with global states that are shared between
these time series, rather than modeling each dynamic process in-
dependently and then learning the mapping between states. Joint
modeling facilitates comparison of different processes and learns
more generalizable models. It is also convenient to work with a
non-parametric model that does not fix the number of states a
priori.

In this paper, to model activity within the d2web, we describe
each forum as a time series of topic vectors representing discus-
sions. We use a generative model proposed by [9, 10], called Beta
Process HMM (BP-HMM), to identify latent states shared by differ-
ent time series. Based on the proposed model, different time series
are described by a subset of shared latent states. The states are
represented by a binary matrix F , where Fi j = 1 means time series
i is associated with state j. An example of F matrix is shown in the
left panel of Figure 2. Given matrix F , each time series is modeled
as a separate hidden Markov model with the states it exhibits. Each
global state is modeled using a multivariate Gaussian distribution,

senting (a) the topic or (b) forum to which the post belongs.
The top 20 topics learned by the 100-topic LDA are shown,
and the post was assigned to the highest probability topic.

when a time series is in state x, its data is sampled from a Gaussian
distribution with mean vector µx and covariance matrix Σx .

Since the number of such states in the data is not known a priori,
the Beta process is used [16, 29] as a prior on matrix F . A Beta
process allows for infinite number of states but encourages sparse
representations. Consider, as an example, a model with K states.
Each state (column of matrix F ) is modeled by a Bernoulli random
variable whose parameter is obtained from a Beta distribution (Beta
Bernoulli process), i.e.,

(1)

θk ∼ Beta(α/k, 1), k = 1, · · · , K
Fnk ∼ Bernoulli(θk ), n = 1, · · · , N
The underlying distribution when this process is extended to
an infinite number of states, as K tends to infinity, is the Beta
process. This process is also known as the Indian Buffet Process
[12, 29] which can be best understood with the following metaphor
involving a sequence of customers (time series) selecting dishes
(states) from an infinitely large buffet. The first customer enters the
buffet and selects servings from Poisson(α) number of dishes. The
n-th customer selects dish k with probability mk /n, where mk
is
the popularity of the dish, yielding the so-called “rich-get-richer”
effect, and Poisson(α/n) new dishes.

With this approach, the number of states can grow arbitrarily
with the size n of the dataset: in other words, the number of states
increases if the data cannot be faithfully represented with the al-
ready defined states. However, the probability of adding new states
decreases according to a Poisson(α/n). Finally, the distribution gen-
erated by the Indian Buffet Process is independent of the order of
the customers (time series). For posterior computations based on
MCMC algorithms, the original work is referenced [9, 10].

3.4 Clustering
To define a similarity measure between two HMMs, one could mea-
sure the probability of their state sequences having been generated
by the same process. Since each time series is associated with a

4.1 Topic Analysis
In this section we explore topics learned by Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation (LDA) by looking at their most significant words. There are
a wide variety of topics covered in our dataset. Table 1 highlights
some of the topics learned by the 100-topic LDA model by showing
significant words associated with them. We visualized the topics
using t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) [21] in

Figure 4: State sequences of forums (each color represents a state) and Dendrogram showing the similarity of forums based
on their learned states.

Figure 3(a). Each dot on the plot represents a post, colored by its
most important topic. Alternatively, we can color the posts in the
t-SNE space by the forum on which they were posted (Figure 3(b)).
The clustering of posts in the forum space suggests that topics are
highly concentrated around specific forums.

4.2 Forum Dynamics
To examine the dynamics of topics on d2web forums, we represent
each forum as a time series of topic vectors learned by the 100-topic
LDA model. Our unit of time in this analysis is a week; to generate
a forum’s vector we average the topic vectors of all posts submitted
to the forum over the course of a week. The time series of weekly
topic vectors were used to both learn HMM states and compute
cross-entropy (cross-entropy is discussed further in 4.3).

After training the BP-HMM model on weekly topic distributions
of forums the model learned 28 states, i.e., 28 different topic distri-
butions. We clustered the forums according to the similarity of their
learned states using the method described in Section 3.4. Figure 4
shows the resulting dendrogram and also the sequences of learned
states for each forum. Each line in the figure represents a forum,
and different states are represented by different colors. Transitions
between states are visible in places the colors alternate.

The clustering results show that the method is able to cluster
forums into meaningful groups. Next we examine a few of the main
clusters:

Cluster 1 mostly contains forums discussing cyber hacking, in-
cluding HackForum, GroundZero, ZeroDay, DeepDotWeb, SafeSky-
Hacks. The two subgroups in this cluster differ mainly in their levels
of activity. Forums in the first subgroup are less active (5 posts in a

week on average), which is why their average weekly topic vector
is more sensitive and their corresponding HMM changes state more
frequently. In the active group (more than 50 posts in a week on
average) the most common state is the yellow state, which corre-
sponds to activation of the following topics (described in Table 1):
16.Law enforcement, 23.Proxy and 17.Hacking tutorial.

Cluster 2 mostly contains dark web marketplaces such as Abraxas
Market, AlphaBay, Dream Market, Hansa Market and BlackWorld,
as well as forums dedicated to their reviews. This cluster is also
divided into two main subgroups: in the first subgroup the dark
blue state dominates representing high activity of discussions re-
garding topics 1.Locations (which is mostly concerned with the sale
of proxy servers), 33.Contact, 34.Thanks and 4.Banking. The second
subgroup, depicted with light blue states, corresponds to the topics
6.Purchase details, 10.Markets, 8.Cryptocurrency and 11.Narcotics.
Based on the clustering, one can characterize forums in the first
subgroup as mostly selling proxy servers and sharing information
about other marketplaces, while forums in the second subgroup
are more involved in selling drugs. In section 4.4.2 we take a deeper
look into forums in the first subgroup.

Cluster 3 is made up of forums related to hacking Playstation
video game consoles where the most prominent state in this cluster
is the Cyan state. The most active topics in this state are 32.Hacking
Consoles and 25.Update.

Cluster 4 (as well as the two forums adjacent) contains forums
which are predominantly focused on white hat hacking. Notable
forums include Metasploit and Hak5. While 0daybank and FreeBuf
are related, they are mostly in Chinese, hence their more active
topics have many non-English tokens and are hard to interpret.

With the state sequences obtained from our BP-HMM model, we
can track forums’ discussions. State transitions indicate a signifi-
cant change in discussions and could represent an event. However,
as shown in Figure 4, some forums change states more frequently,
thus their transitions might have less significance. In order to be
able to recognize significant transitions, we describe the volatility
measure, a forum’s likelihood to drastically change its own topic
distribution. As each forum is characterized by its learned transi-
tion matrix over the global states, we compute a forum’s volatility
by adding the off diagonal elements of its transition matrix, the
probability of changing states. Since we are interested in finding
variations in topics discussed rather than the activity of forums,
the probabilities of the state corresponding to 0 posts (i.e., no data)
were not taken into account. Also to validate the results obtained,
a similar volatility measure was computed with cross entropy and
is described in section 4.3. Table 2 shows a list of forums with high
and low volatility computed via both methods.

Using the described volatility measure with the HMM, we find
that the most volatile forums with at least 10 posts per week (on
average) are OpenSC Marketplace, Stronghold Paste and Demon
Forum and that the least volatile forums are BugsChromium, CSU,
and the subreddit PS3Homebrew. An estimate of forum’s volatility
or lack thereof is also apparent from its state sequence in Figure 4.
Stronghold Paste is an onion website similar to Pastebin and cov-
ers different topics and hence different states. However, there are
two main states it oscillates between: in one of them hacking and
cyber security topics (described by topic 19.Web Vulnerabilities)
are more prominent, and in the other one, topic 8.Cryptocurrencies
has high activation. These results show state transitions in forums
like Stronghold Paste have a low probability of being indicative of
an event. However transitions in forums like BugsChromium or
CSU might be of more interest.

4.3 Topic Dynamics
Since HMM segments forum dynamics into discrete states, it is less
sensitive to noise observed in the data. On the other hand it might
not be able to capture small meaningful changes or trends. Hence,
we also compute cross entropy of forums as a measure of dispersion
over time to validate results obtained with non-parametric HMM
model. To compute the cross-entropy we use the following formula
where Q is the topic distribution for a forum averaged over the
entire timespan and P is the topic distribution in a unit of time.

(3)

H (p, q) = EP [− log2 Q(x)]
The majority of the forums have cross-entropy values in the same
range. The forum with the lowest average cross-entropy (and there-
fore lowest volatility) is CSU, a forum primarily concerned with
credit card dumps, and as such makes sense that the forum would
focus on very few topics of discussion. On the other hand, forums
like CodePaste and DroidJack have some of the highest values
of cross-entropy, which suggests that the topics of discussion are
dispersed and change more often in these forums. Table 2 shows
forums with lowest and highest average values of cross-entropy,
used as a measure of volatility. This is consistent with the result
we got from the HMM model, in the sense that forums with low
or high volatility based on the HMM measure also appear in the
bottom or top of the ranking based on the cross entropy measure.

Results show that large and active forums have wide-ranging dis-
cussions on diverse topics however their average topic distribution
is usually consistent over time. Forums focused on specific topics
like CSU also tend to have low volatility. On the other end of the
spectrum there are forums with medium or low activity with dis-
cussions spanning a wide range of topics like Stronghold Paste and
CodePaste.

4.4 Case Studies
4.4.1 Prescription Drugs. In this section we give an example of
how this framework could be used to study d2web discussions. In
the search for anomalies using the results obtained by HMM we
observed a rare state, exhibited only on 3 first weeks of June 2017
and first week of August 2017 by forum OffensiveSecurity where
topic 3.Pharmaceuticals has its highest probability. OffensiveSecu-
rity is considered a low volatility forum based on both measures
computed in Table 2 which makes this transition more of interest.
By looking at the posts published on this forum and on the
aforementioned dates we retrieved similar posts with variations
in the names of the drugs being advertised. An excerpt from one
of the posts is as follows: “...buy lynoral cheap buy generic femara

This analysis shows a high and anomalous volume of advertise-
ments for prescription drugs in the specified dates which suggests
some precipitating event that merits further investigation.

We also looked at one of the most illicit drug topics, 11.Narcotics.
We found that besides 11.Narcotics other prominent topics in the

credit cards, personal and/or financial data to purchase goods, laun-
der money, or generally steal an individual’s money. Proxy servers
are commonly used to “cash out” stolen credit card information by
buying items like pre-paid gift cards through payment processors.
In our corpus, there are a number of documents that mention card-
ing. An example that suggests intent to use proxies for carding is
as follows: “...proxies are often blacklisted when used for fraud so
im looking for a source for fresh proxies for use for carding...”

4.4.3 Marketplace Shutdowns. Our last case study regards the
seizure of the AlphaBay marketplace by the FBI on July 4th 2017
and the seizure of the Hansa marketplace on July 20th 2017 by
the Dutch NHTCU. We show cross-entropy, forum activity and
transitions between states to analyze this case study.

Included in our d2web data are forums related to transactions and
reviews of this marketplace, including several private subreddits.
We observed that a few of the forums in our dataset have peaks in
activity around the same time. Figure 6(a) shows number of posts
published in these forums. Forums related to AlphaBay and Hansa
have peaks on the date of AlphaBay and Hansa closure respectively.
Interestingly, a week after the Hansa closure Dream Market and
the subreddits DreamMarket and DreamMarketDarknet had their
highest value which suggests that users of these two big market
places, AlphaBay and Hansa, have migrated to Dream Market. To
check whether the forums respond to these events by changing
the topics of discussion, we compute the cross-entropy. As seen in
Figure 6(b) we see that two relevant forums, one about AlphaBay
and one about DreamMarket, experience a change in their topic
vectors after the shutdown (2017 week 27, or 07-04-2017). The cross-
entropy increases around that time, suggesting growing difference
from the aggregate topic distribution for their respective forums
however changes in the volume of posts were more significant. We
also observe state transitions in Dream Market forum in all three
dates (AlphaBay and Hansa closure and the week after when there
is a peak in activity for Dream Market related forums).

5 DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS
We used LDA to learn a rich set of latent components from a large
corpus of documents spanning different topics and make use of
a non-parametric HMM to better understand how those forums
relate to one another in terms of the dynamics of their content. We
then proceeded to use what we learn from both the states and the
topics to identify specific posts discussing malicious activities that
are understood to largely come from the dark and deep web.

This work can be extended in a number of different ways. First,
one can use our framework to analyze new and unseen forums. Sec-
ond, we can extend the framework to explicitly consider patterns
of activity (e.g., frequency of posts) alongside the semantic infor-
mation of the topic dynamics. Additionally, using average of the
topic distributions of posts in a forum in one week to represent that
forum will invariably smooth out events that have a small number
of events associated with them. An alternate method that would be
more sensitive to smaller fluctuations is to use the maximum value
for a topic obtained from any post in that week.

A promising extension to our system would be to use a dynamic
topic model that incorporates a birth-death process for the popula-
tion of topics, allowing for new topics to emerge and for old topics

state where this topic is at its highest value are 9. Marijuana and
7.LSD. These are a few forums which exhibit this state: The Majestic
Garden, the DarkNetReviews subreddit, and the HANSAdnmDark-
NetMarket subreddit.

4.4.2 Proxy Servers. The second case study is around the discus-
sion of proxy servers and the sale of services that can be used to
game social media platforms, defraud ad networks, build botnets,
and effectively launder illegal activity. We use the clustering from
HMM to help identify which kinds of forums have high activity re-
lated to proxy servers. Compared to many of the other topics, topic
1.Locations is concerned primarily with the sale of proxy servers.
When we examined cluster 2 from the HMM clustering, we noticed
a significant activation of this topic. Interestingly, the ten most
active forums in cluster 2 seem to capture most of the activation of
the topic over time. As seen in Fig. 5, we examine the forum-weeks
(points) with significant probability (above 0.50) for topic 1.Loca-
tions from forums in cluster 2 and recover approximately 11,000
documents which seem to be automated posts advertising the sale
of access to proxies all over the world. These 11,000 documents
come mostly from CSU and BlackWorld: both forums have subfo-
rums dedicated to the advertising of proxies and are in the top 10
active forums in the cluster. An excerpt from one of these posts
is as follows: “...camarillo | ca | unknown | united states | checked
at vn5socks.netlive...”. When we look for documents pertaining to
more specific uses of proxies, we find approximately 20 posts that
directly mention “viewbot”. Viewbotting is the act of using bots to
artificially inflate the number of views on a social media profile (e.g.
YouTube and Twitch). As it can be difficult to determine if a viewer
is a human or a bot, this can potentially trick the social media plat-
form into thinking a profile is more popular than it actually is and
result in more attention than it would obtain organically. Alternate
uses of viewbots are to watch video ads on a channel, artificially
increasing ad revenue, etc. An excerpt from one of these documents
is as follows: “...i viewbotted my vid to 1k views and got 10 slaves...”
Another potential malicious use of proxy servers is for carding.
Carding in this case refers to the fradulent use of other people’s

to die off. Online communities move fast, and a topic model that
includes data from even a couple months ago can become obsolete
and hinder productive analysis.
