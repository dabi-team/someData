ABSTRACT

Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) manage critical infrastructures by controlling the processes
based on the “physics” data gathered by edge sensor networks. Recent innovations in ubiquitous
computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly intercon-
nected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the “security by obscurity” principle provided by air-gapping is no
longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial
vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due
to this transition while the most common ones are related to weak boundary protection. Although
there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding these reports. This paper
bridges this gap by deﬁning and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular,
multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS
cyber incidents. We also identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap
in existing literature while deﬁning future research directions.

Introduction

Industry 4.0 [1] and Industrial Internet [2] have accelerated the integration of industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs)
[3] to the various industries ranged from manufacturing [4] to energy management [5], water treatment systems [6],
and many more [7, 8, 9]. Critical infrastructures (CIs) [10] utilize ICPSs to perform and supervise industrial tasks
in harsh industrial environments. Plenty of research [11, 12, 13] has been done on how to facilitate the migration of
air-gapped legacy ICS to the modern ones that are even assisted by cloud technologies. These studies are also guided
by alliances/institutions such as the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) [14] to prevent insecure integration. This rapid
transformation of ICPSs does bring many cybersecurity challenges. There are three mutually inclusive primary reasons
behind these challenges: (i) high connectivity, (ii) increased attack surface, and (iii) heterogeneous infrastructure.

The loss or compromise of CIs that supply fundamental needs may result in catastrophic impact. The survivability
of the CIs depends on the security of ICPSs. The defence approaches that focus on CPSs security such as anomaly
detection [15], secure routing [16], game theories [17, 18], and watermarking [19], cannot be directly applied to ICPSs
that differ from CPSs in many aspects. The security challenges for ICPSs require unique solutions that consider harsh
industrial environments. Even though there is a growing number of publications, the literature that focuses on ICPS
security is quite diverse. This independent presentation and evaluation of complementary topics create an unnecessary
diversity regarding taxonomies, evaluation metrics, implementation techniques, and test environments. This creates a
challenging environment for the new proposals while limiting the discussion of research outputs in a more uniﬁed way.

Existing Surveys. The ICPS, ICS, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks
(IWSN) are not mutually independent disciplines. Hence, we have also investigated surveys/reviews of them. However,
it was challenging to decide research criteria as there is no framework that explicitly describes the relationships of
different industrial disciplines studied by the academia. Surveys of ICS challenges from a security point of view based
on cybersecurity management are presented in [20, 21]. Several surveys [22, 23, 24] classify IDS techniques, review
security and privacy issues while systematizing CPSs security and providing a security framework. Surveys of the current
challenges for various ICPS architectures are available in [25, 26, 27]. The technical review of control engineering
tools is presented in [28] while review of the key enabling technologies and major applications of ICPSs is available in
[29]. ICPSs attack detection techniques are surveyed in [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Several proposals [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]
introduce IIoT, study state-of-the-art implementation, and give an outlook on possible solutions while mentioning future
research directions. Other surveys [41, 42, 43] deﬁne principles, review technical challenges, and provide structured
overview. We classiﬁed the previous surveys according to their topics in Table 1. We consider all these existing
reviews/surveys complementary to our work.

Scope of the survey. The topic of CPS is indeed very popular in academia even though being a fairly new term. This
growing popularity is also recognized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that has published a
CPS framework [44]. However, although there are similarities, we believe CPS and ICPS security should be treated as a
distinct research areas due to attributes (based on the differences between Information Technology (IT) and Operational
Technology (OT)) that are unique to industrial environments. Cyber incidents that occur in industrial environments
might result in catastrophic failures. Therefore, we have focused on the ICPS security and organized our survey by
taking these attributes into consideration.

Our contributions. (i) We brieﬂy deﬁne ICPSs, IWSN, IIoT, and ICS by identifying their unique environment
characteristics, relationships, and current positions in the literature. We have only investigated and compared the ones
that we think as the most similar to ICPSs according to the way that they are studied in the literature. We deﬁne the
fundamental components of an ICPS and present a modern ICPS architecture (see §2). (ii) We analyze the differences
between IT and OT and explain why the security aspect of ICPSs is a unique ﬁeld that requires particular interest (see
§2.3). (iii) We provide a comprehensive review on industrial protocols and infrastructures (see §3). (iv) We review the
present cyberattack taxonomies from both academic and industrial domains and provide ours which combines their
strong aspects (see §4.1). Then we present key ﬁndings from several industrial reports [45, 46, 47] (see §4.3). Then we
analyze the available cyber defense approaches that can be implemented against the top ten most common industrial
vulnerabilities (see §4.4). (iv) We deﬁne ICPS security characteristics (see §4.5) and (v) review the latest trends on
ICPS edge network (see §4.6). (vi) Finally we share the lessons learned (see §5) our recommendations (see §6) and (see
§7) conclusions.

INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS & INFRASTRUCTURES

We now brieﬂy deﬁne each system, clarify their relationships, introduce ICPS components, and analyze the differences
between IT and OT.

2.1

Industrial System Deﬁnitions

Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks. Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN) is made from a group of spatially dis-
tributed autonomous/self-processing sensors that simultaneously perform various tasks (e.g., monitoring, detecting,
and recording) at a lower cost than wired systems [48] are deployed in various environments ranging from local (e.g.
home, car) to industrial (e.g. military, and health) [49]. In WSN, the current main challenges are related to latency
and security [50]. These two features are even more signiﬁcant for IWSN as providing availability is the primary
concern for industrial systems deployed to CIs. Thus, various expertise among different disciplines including but not
limited to (i) industrial applications, (ii) sensor architectures, (iii) communication/transmission technologies, and (iv)
network architectures are desired secure IWSNs [41]. Current IWSN technologies are supported by standardization
organizations (e.g., ISA, IEC, IEEE) due to their adaptability to harsh environments [42]. IWSNs are being integrated
into the internet via gateways [51] and even in the future, they may even have dedicated IPs [52].

Industrial Internet of Things. IIoT refers to a technology emerged from ICS (e.g., Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA), Distributed Control System (DCS)) with the integration of interconnected devices, networking
architectures (i.e., IWSN), and services through the internet. Conventional manufacturing, automation, computing
systems are started to utilize IIoT by implementing cloud infrastructures [35]. IIoT is composed of two main parts
as ICPS: the cyber part (e.g., sensing, networking, computing) and the physical part (e.g., sensors, actuators). Thus,
we can identify IIoT as a subsection of ICPS. The deﬁning feature of IIoT is the internet connection provided via
network nodes that offer remote management. Besides, the rapid development of cloud technology has made IIoT more
attractive as it provides efﬁcient processing and storage of big data [36]. The increasing heterogeneity of IIoT has led to
the development of WoT [40] to solve interoperability problems. We believe in the future, the industrial Web of Things
(IWoT) [53] will be a canonical research area as the connectivity grows within the industrial environments.

Industrial Control Systems. ICS is the common term that refers to control systems such as SCADA, DCS, Pro-
grammable Logic Controllers (PLC) systems that are located in various industrial sectors. Years ago, ICS was
air-gapped while running proprietary protocols therefore being less prone to cyberattacks. Now, ICS adapted to changes
that have come with Industry 4.0. Today’s ICS are integrated with IWSN, IIoT, and new generation PLCs that evolves
them into advanced ICPSs. SCADA and DCS also are converged together allowing the implementation of hybrid
systems that generate new challenges [54]. ICS are also targeted by cyberattacks in a daily manner where a successful
cyberattack may result in a devastating impact. Therefore, security management [21] is a key point for ICS that is
guided by national/regional organizations including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [55].

Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems. The rapid developments of embedded systems, sensors, and networks resulted
in new kinds of mechanisms with multi-tasking capabilities. Thus, the solid line between the physical and cyber

3

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 12, 2021

environments are started to blur. The term of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) presents today’s advanced computing and
networking technologies in a uniﬁed way [56]. Industrial Cyber-Physical System (ICPS) refer to CPS that is speciﬁcally
designed for industrial appliances. ICPSs are deployed to various domains including manufacturing, transportation,
healthcare, and energy. The factories belonging to these domains utilize modern ICPSs are called “smart factories”.
Figure 1 summarizes the difference in hierarchies between old and modern ICPS.

Figure 1: Illustrates the factory hierarchies [57] of Industry 3.0 (a) and Industry 4.0 (b). The increasing interconnectivity
blurred the strict lines between ICPS levels and allowed the development of advanced heterogeneous systems which
led to the emergence of the new term “smart factory”. Increasing overall efﬁciency is the main motivation behind this
transition. However, organizations that tend to rush adopting new technologies without considering how to secure such
a transition are prone to cyberattacks.

There are several CPS architectures present in the literature. The most basic one is 3C CPS architecture presented
in [58, 59] where 3C means control, communication, and computation. Other available CPS architectures that
classify the CPS domain in a more detailed way are 5C [4, 60], and 8C [61]. These processes are completed by a
variety of interconnected components that are adapting to the latest technologies including real-time multiprocessing.
Commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) products [62] that perform the computation on the edge (via edge nodes) to forward
already processed data to the cloud to minimize the system load/delay in industrial automation systems are such an
example. The main components that are included in most of the ICPS architectures are sensors, actuators, controllers,
and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI). Figure 2 introduces the domain relationship of ICPS.

Sensors. Sensors are devices that convert the physical data to cyber data to monitor and forward events to designated
components. Their application range varies from smart homes, transportation, manufacturing, medical systems to
aviation. They can be grouped either according to their purposes such as temperature, proximity, light, ultrasonic and
gas sensors, or their use cases such as industrial, residential, and commercial. As expected, industrial sensors have
higher accuracy and durability thus cost higher than their peers while requiring periodic calibration to keep the data
integrity. Industrial sensors are mostly utilized for ubiquitous monitoring purposes including human activity [63, 64],
gas [65], and robotic arm [66].

Actuators. Actuators convert cyber data to a physical phenomenon therefore they are the complementary opposite
of sensors. They are usually classiﬁed according to their working principles such as hydraulic, mechanical, electric,
etc. Recent studies [42, 67] show that wireless actuators are very promising and even can be utilized for industrial

Figure 2: Illustrates the fundamental relationship between cyber and physical domain. To consider a domain as
cyber-physical, it should at least include a cyber and physical phenomenon.

applied when connecting outer networks.

environments where real-time applications take place. However, the new technologies and methods are required to
overcome the existing challenges to accept wireless actuators as reliable for performing industrial tasks.

Controllers. The main control unit that gets inputs from sensors and sends outputs to actuators or central units is
deﬁned as the controller. The main controller types are Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), Distributed Control
Systems (DCS), and Programmable Automation Controller (PAC). Controllers are evolved to the point where they
can be utilized interchangeably [68] with the removal of technological limits that determines their design choices.
Additionally, it is even possible to convert a microcontroller such as Raspberry Pi to a PLC via OpenPLC [69] to utilize
for a low-cost simulation.

HMIs. Even though fully automated systems are getting popular, ICS that supervise CIs always requires human
intervention at some point. HMI is the place where this intervention happens either for monitoring or controlling
purposes. HMI technology has already adopted touch screens, and mobile devices. In the future, the cloud-based mobile
HMIs [70] will be more widespread. There are also other ICPS components such as the Remote Terminal Unit (RTU),
and data historian that are being integrated into main components to offer high connectivity with simple management.
The future ICPSs will be only composed of components with multi-tasking capabilities. The modern manufacturing
ICPS architecture contains aforementioned components is presented in Figure 3.

2.2 The Relationship Between Industrial Technologies

We believe the best way to understand the relationship between the aforementioned industrial technologies is to examine
the work provided by previous surveys. While Mitchell and Chen [22], Leitao et al. [26], Huang et al. [31], Jbair et al.
[28] provide a CPS deﬁnition, they do not acknowledge its relationship with other technologies. Ding et al. [30], Lu
et al. [42], Yue et al. [13] position ICPS above other industrial terms and claim that IWSNs and industrial wireless
sensor-actuator networks (IWSANs) can be referred to as subgroups of ICPSs. Lu [29] describes CPS as a technology
that integrates the features of IoT and the Web of Things (WoT). Colombo et al. [71] describe ICPS as an industrial
discipline that utilizes information communication technologies to integrate digital and physical elements to create
intelligent systems. The authors also describe IoT and CPS as complementary disciplines by mentioning that IoT
combines ubiquitous systems with CPS technologies. Karnouskos [72] mentions that SCADA relies on CPSs for
monitoring purposes, hence deﬁnes them as complementary systems. While the most accepted opinion is that the ICPS
is the combination of aforementioned disciplines, we could not ﬁnd any framework that clearly outlines the similarities

FAAPLCGatewayAFFControl StationDataHistorianHMIFirewallCorporate NetworkFirewallInternetCloudA PREPRINT - JANUARY 12, 2021

and differences. We believe using these terms interchangeably results in an independent presentation of complementary
works. Thus, there is a need for a framework that positions each term by clarifying their relationships.

2.3

Information Technology vs Operational Technology

We deﬁne IT as the technology of processing the information (data) while OT as the technology that focuses on
monitoring and controlling physical phenomenon via physical devices and processes. This is why we see IT systems in
nearly any kind of environment while we encounter with OT systems in only industrial ones. OT systems must operate
in real-time due to being deployed in such an environment where the availability of the data is the primary concern.
The adoption of mobile devices improves the availability of the system by providing ubiquitous access to authorized
personnel [73]. Major ICPS suppliers such as Schneider Electric [74] and Rockwell Automation [75] already patented
such mobile technologies nearly 20 years ago that also conﬁrms how interconnected today’s technologies are.

ICPSs were air-gapped which means they were isolated from any outer networks. Therefore, they were automatically
being protected from outsider threats. The only option for an adversary to attack a system was physically inserting
data (i.e., via USB sticks) from the inside. Also, the IT and OT domains were kept separated. In today’s ICPS, OT has
started to adopt IT-like technologies (e.g., TCP/IP protocol, Windows as an OS) because of its beneﬁts [76]. However,
controlling and monitoring OT devices via IT systems cause new vulnerabilities to appear as the “security through
obscurity” approach is no longer applied. The implementation of new security measures requires the harmonization
of IT and OT strategies and understanding of basic differences between two technologies. Table 2 summarizes the
fundamental differences that we consider signiﬁcant. Relatively new trends such as fog and cloud computing drive
further convergence of IT and OT. In addition to these, wireless technology is also now more robust [77] and deployable
for harsh industrial environments. We believe in the future the IT and OT will be integrated, and holistic approaches
will form a base for future studies.

ICPS Communication Technologies & Protocols

We classify the communication protocols according to standard availability, communication type, and network topology.
There are two main communication protocol types in terms of standard availability: open, and proprietary protocols.
Open protocols may be developed by a single or group of vendors and may require a license fee. They can be utilized
with multiple vendors and also supported by a third-party software. On the other hand, proprietary protocols are
developed and controlled by a single vendor. They are strictly restricted under legal terms. Legacy industrial systems
had proprietary protocols therefore making manufacturer companies dependent on certain vendors. These protocols
had been designed to achieve the best efﬁciency without considering security as a primary concern. The principle of
security through obstruction was followed. However, even though there are still such systems, most of the ICPSs are no
more air-gapped and even some of them are adopting cloud technologies. This makes open protocols more secure, and
popular than the proprietary ones as they are developed by non-proﬁt communities that keep them updated. Also, most
companies prefer being more independent [78] when establishing their ICPS as they may integrate their systems with
other components when needed.

The features of communication protocols for wireless and wired technologies differ from each other in many aspects.
Legacy systems were mostly utilized wired communications technologies, unlike today’s ICPS which have a combination
of both. Wired protocols such as Modbus and BACnet also compatible with many wireless technologies including
Zigbee [79]. Wireless technologies are easy to deploy but may suffer from interference in an environment with high
noise like electric distribution facilities. Wired communications are more reliable in terms of speed but harder to install
and maintain. The systems that contain both can beneﬁt from the advantages of each technology.

Figure 4: Illustrates industrial communication network topologies in the following order: (a) point-to-point, (b) bus
(line), (c) ring, (d) star, (e) mesh, (f) hybrid. Each topology has unique pros and cons. For example, networks with
mesh topology are more robust but cost higher, while bus topology costs less but more prone to failures. We can see
these kinds of trade-offs for each network topology. Hybrid topologies are preferred in the latest ICPSs due to allowing
more interconnectivity.

Data ﬂow in the communication network may be one-way or bidirectional. Industrial manufacturers/vendors produce a
variety of devices that comply with different topologies which determines the arrangement of nodes. These topologies
either can be centralized (i.e., star) or decentralized (i.e., mesh). We illustrate the common topologies that are utilized in
industrial environments in Figure 4. ICPS can beneﬁt from the high number of nodes in terms of the computational
power however it comes with an additional cost. Therefore, minimizing the number of nodes is one of the principles to
consider when designing an ICPS. Research that examines this trade-off is presented in [80].

We can classify currently available industrial communication technologies according to their working principles:
ﬁeldbus [81], industrial ethernet [82], and wireless [83]. Fieldbus. End-user companies needed a real-time network
model where they can connect all their industrial ﬁeld assets (e.g., sensors, actuators) to increase production efﬁciency.
This led to the development of ﬁeldbus technology. The ﬁrst ones came as proprietary protocols but later most of the
major automation companies established groups/alliances and shared their licenses because the end-users required
more heterogeneous production environments. Industrial Ethernet. The industrial communication technology started to
shift to industrial ethernet from ﬁeldbus because of the promises (i.e., very low latency) that ethernet offered. Wireless.
The future industrial systems are expected to adopt more wireless technologies because they are easy to deploy and
scalable. They also allow a low cost remote management without requiring additional setup. Early wireless systems
lacked authentication schemes while having high latency which made them inadequate for industrial systems. Even
though these issues are mostly resolved today, sustainability is still a big challenge, as wireless systems operate in
resource-constrained environments. Figure 5 shows the market shares of deployed industrial network technologies
respectively for 2019 and 2020.

Figure 5: (a) Industrial network shares for top 5 protocols deployed in 2019 [84] including how the market shares differ
per industrial network technology are shown. EtherNet/IP and Proﬁnet led the industrial network market in 2019. Both
of them are industrial ethernet standards while EtherNet/IP is popular in the USA, Proﬁnet is widely accepted in Europe.
In terms of overall market shares, Industrial Ethernet has a considerable lead. Increased bandwidth, high data transfer
rate, and reliable real-time connection are the main reasons why companies favor industrial ethernet. (b) The same
ﬁndings for 2020 [85] are shown. While the top 5 protocols do not show any signiﬁcant changes, the Industrial Ethernet
deployment rate is 5% increased while Fieldbus is 5% decreased which shows there is a transition from Fieldbus to
Ethernet.

Fieldbus. Modbus. Open protocol developed and administered by Modbus Organization [86]. It is the most common
industrial protocol that has several variants such as Modbus RTU (ﬁeldbus) and Modbus TCP/IP (ethernet). It can be
integrated with PLCs ranging from a variety of vendors. DNP3. Open protocol owned and developed by the DNP
Users Group [87]. IEEE also standardized DNP3 [88] as it is one of the most common protocols that is utilized in
power systems. It does not require additional setup to communicate with non-RTU units which makes it suitable for
complex systems. BACnet. Open protocol mainly developed for building automation and control networks [89] also
utilized in the heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) industry. The protocol is maintained and developed by
the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) [90]. Recently, BACnet
Secure Connect (BACnet/SC) is proposed by ASHRAE to prevent problems when integrating IT systems into OT
infrastructure for cloud-based applications [91]. DeviceNet. Open protocol invented by Rockwell Automation [92],
now developed by ODVA [93]. The reduced number of wires with high ﬂame resistance makes the DeviceNet network
suitable for solar applications [94]. However, the increased number of nodes in DeviceNet causes an exponential
increase in time delay [95] which may raise an issue for real-time complex networks.

Industrial Ethernet. Proﬁnet. Open Industrial Ethernet Standard developed and administrated by PROFINET
International (PI) organization [96] that has around 1700 members. It provides a low response time that is ideal for
real-time applications. The connection is provided by an ethernet jack that offers high ﬂexibility. Proﬁnet networks
can easily interact with the IoT infrastructure [97]. EtherCAT. Ethernet-based open communication protocol designed
for automation to minimize the delay within the industrial network. EtherCAT Technology Group [98] maintains the
protocol. EtherCAT has a low implementation cost and also provides high-speed real-time communication [99] with low
latency [100]. Thus, it is suitable for real-time robotic applications [101, 102]. EtherNet/IP. Open industrial protocol
currently maintained and standardized by ODVA [103]. The EtherNet/IP network can be expanded by ethernet switches
that theoretically enables connecting an unlimited number of nodes [104]. That also makes EtherNet/IP suitable easy to
implement for highly interconnect ICPS. It offers several network structures including ring, star, and linear.

Wireless. Zigbee. One of the most popular open wireless communication protocol that is utilized in sectors ranging
from industrial automation to smart homes/systems. It is administered and standardized by the Zigbee Alliance [105].
Being a low power solution and allowing remote management makes Zigbee suitable for environmental monitoring
[106]. Bluetooth. Open wireless communication protocol that is designed as Personal Area Network (PAN), managed
and standardized by Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) [107]. Currently, the latest standardized version is Bluetooth
5.0. The rapid development of Bluetooth accelerates its integration into industrial applications. Not supporting mesh
topology was a big downside of Bluetooth especially regarding industrial applications and led the proposal of academic
solutions as seen in [108]. Therefore, Bluetooth SIG added this feature [109] and standardized it which is considered
as a huge step in Bluetooth technology. LoRaWAN. Open wireless low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) protocol
developed by Semtech maintained and standardized by LoRa Alliance [110]. It is arguably one of the most common
LPWAN protocols utilized in many applications ranging from agricultural to home automation. LoRaWAN is suitable
for smart home applications but for real-time monitoring, it should only be used where the application does not require
a very low response time [111]. WirelessHART. Open wireless communication protocol based on the IEEE 802.15.4
standard developed by Field COMM Group [112] for industrial control applications. WirelessHART devices have the
ability of bidirectional communication that is advantageous for mesh networks. A comprehension of WirelessHART
with several wireless standards is presented in [113]. ISA-100.11a. Open wireless communication protocol based on
IEEE 802.15.4 standard developed by ISA [114] to provide ﬂexibility for industrial automation systems. ISA-100.11a
supports mesh and star topologies. It can also communicate with multiple protocols via gateways thus allowing
coexistence of wireless networks. 6LoWPAN. IPv6 over Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) [115] is a
wireless communication protocol based on IEEE 802.15.4 standard that is developed and standardized by Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) [116]. The development of 6LoWPAN was a major stone for IIoT as it has provided
an IP-based solution for a range of devices. However, IP-based solutions rise security concerns due to increased
connectivity. We illustrate our security-oriented review of industrial communication protocols in Table 3.

ICPS Cybersecurity Analysis

ICPS is relatively a new term compared to IWSN, IIoT, ICS, DCS, and SCADA. Even though these systems are
complementary to each other, there is an inadequate number of studies that examine the security of them under the
ICPS roof. This leads to different study inputs such as taxonomies and evaluation metrics while making it harder to
generate a common output for further research. Therefore, we have surveyed the studies that are also related to the
these systems and realized there is a need for multi-dimensional adaptive ICPS attack taxonomy. In this section, ﬁrst we
deﬁne ICPS attack taxonomy and evaluate real-life ICPS incidents. Then, we summarize key ﬁndings from several
ICPS vulnerability assessment reports [46, 47, 45]. Finally, we deﬁne ICPS security characteristics and review proposed
countermeasures against most common ICPS vulnerabilities.

ICPS Attack Taxonomy

According to [117], a well-designed taxonomy should have the following attributes: mutually exclusive, exhaustive,
unambiguous, repeatable, accepted, and useful. We believe taxonomies that follow these principles and mention
countermeasures and vulnerabilities are more applicable to real-life applications. We have evaluated the available
security taxonomies based on their contents and summarized our ﬁndings in Table 4. We have observed that most of
the current taxonomies mainly focus on the IT ﬁeld and the taxonomies that address OT mostly consider a certain
characteristic (e.g., environment, application) which makes them non-usable for different OT systems. We have
considered the aforementioned when developing our taxonomy. Also, industrial environments are adapting new
ubiquitous technologies hence being more dynamic and heterogeneous. This makes non-adaptive attack taxonomies
invalid for future cyber incidents. For this reason, multi-dimensional adaptive taxonomy that is speciﬁcally designed for
a certain environment is more effective in terms of describing sophisticated cyberattacks. Thus, we have developed
such a taxonomy where some of the key features are outsourced to an online attack taxonomy [118] that is regularly
updated. We now present this taxonomy in Figure 6 that contains the following major attributes:

(1) Industrial Sector: It is signiﬁcant to deﬁne the sector to gain an initial opinion about cyberattacks in general. A
food company that operates in two different sectors; food production (manufacturing), and delivery (transporta-
tion), may be subject to a cyberattack that targets both. We use the UK’s Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation
(SIC) [134] that also complies with the standardization of the European Union [135] and the United Nations
[136] in our taxonomy.

Figure 6: Multi-dimensional adaptive ICPS attack taxonomy. We combine several strong aspects of other taxonomies to
build efﬁcient, multi-dimensional, and adaptive ICPS attack taxonomy. "Attack mechanism" and "attack domain" is
taken from CAPEC [118] while "industrial sector" is from SIC [134], and "threat source" from NIST [55]. The only
downside of the proposed taxonomy is its dependence on CAPEC. As long as the CAPEC keeps their database up to
date, we believe the proposed taxonomy will be sufﬁcient. Even though we claim our taxonomy is suitable and efﬁcient
for ICPS attacks in general, we believe application-speciﬁc (e.g., manufacturing, transportation) taxonomies have a
higher potential to describe industrial attacks more accurately. Only major classes of multi-dimensional branches are
shown due to space constraints.

(2) Threat Source: Who or what is behind the incident. It is necessary to identify the threat source to provide
further protection for future attacks. In some cases, the threat source might compromise someone else’s cyber
source to hide its identity which is a very common case for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In
that case, it is signiﬁcant to distinguish them from victims. We utilize the threat source deﬁnition of NIST [55]
in our taxonomy.

(3) Attack Motivation: Recognizing the main reason that is directly related to the threat source behind the attack is
crucial to determine what you may face in the aftermath of the incident. As the motive can be many things (e.g.
ﬁnancial gain, political opinion), categorizing attack motivation may result in an excessive amount of terms.
Therefore, we believe commenting on this issue with a few sentences/words is more practical and informative.

(4) Attack Scope: ICPS is a combination of cyber and physical systems. The attack may target not only the cyber
but also the physical domain or both. For example, if the attacker accesses the network and steals data, that
attack is cyber only. However, if the attacker gains control of the actuator via unauthorized network access, the
attacks become cyber-physical. The only physical attacks are also possible such as physical theft or physically
damaging an ICPS equipment. Thus, the scope is divided into three: cyber, physical, and cyber-physical.

(5) Attack Domain: Describes the attack pattern. Deﬁning the attacked domain is signiﬁcant because similar
attacks may require similar countermeasures and categorizing them hierarchically supports developing an
adequate security plan. We include the multi-dimensional attack domain taxonomy of Common Attack Pattern
Enumeration and Classiﬁcation (CAPEC) [118] which is sufﬁcient, detailed, and up to date. There are six main
attack domains deﬁned by CAPEC: software, hardware, communications, supply chain, social engineering,
and physical security. For example, a common “e-mail injection” attack goes into the following categories in
order as follows: software, and parameter injection.

(6) Attack Mechanism: It deﬁnes the attack technique. Classifying the attack mechanism helps to ﬁgure out
the vulnerability of the exploited system. One attack may contain several attack mechanisms (techniques)
as mostly seen in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks where the attacker remains undetected for an
extended period. We also utilize the multi-dimensional attack mechanism taxonomy of CAPEC [118] in this
case.

(7) Attack Type: The cyberattacks are divided into two categories in general: active, and passive. Imagine an
attack scenario where the attacker has gained unauthorized access to the edge data (the data that is driven by
sensors) in ICPS. If the attacker just extorts the sensor data without modifying, it is a passive attack. However,
if the attacker falsiﬁes the sensor data to further malicious activities the attack turns into an active attack.
(8) Targeted Principle: There are three main information security principles: conﬁdentiality, availability, and
integrity. Conﬁdentiality refers to the protection of data from unauthorized third parties. Availability refers to
the data being accessible by authorized parties whenever needed. Integrity refers to the data being complete
and uncorrupted. These three are deﬁned as the CIA triad. One attack may target one or more principles at the
same time. For example, while ransomware attacks mostly target availability, malware such as Trojan may
target both conﬁdentiality and integrity.

4.2 Evaluation of Real-life ICPS Incidents Based on ICPS Attack Taxonomy

ICPS incidents gain lots of industrial and academic interest as they are discovered. Academia, industry, and even
sometimes government entities provide a deep analysis of the incident and publish report/article to inform related
communities. Successful attacks with higher impacts subject to more research due to encompassing a variety of aspects
including threat actor, attack method, and impact. We have evaluated 15 ICPS incidents (see Table 5 for evaluation and
Figure 7 for timeline) based on our multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy.

Figure 7: The timeline of the signiﬁcant ICPS attacks.

Maroochy Shire Sewage Spill [137]. In 2000, a former employee of Maroochy Water Services hacked 142 sewage
pumping stations and caused spilling around one million liters of sewage to local water systems. The attack was carried
out with just a laptop, compact PC, and radio transmitter. The disgruntled employee accessed the system with stolen
system assets and acted as an insider. He actively drove around pumping stations with a car with the hacking tools in it
and manipulated the system values. Maroochy Shire Sewage Spill incident is a good example in terms of showing us
how using the same credentials that are known by former employees might cause incidents. Industrial organizations
must rearrange these credentials to prevent unauthorized access.

Stuxnet [138]. In 2009, the nuclear facility of Iran was targeted by the most complex attack known to date. Stuxnet
infected more than 100,000 hosts in 25 countries where around 60% of infected hosts were located in Iran. It speciﬁcally
targets the vulnerabilities that exist in Microsoft OS and Siemens PLCs while remaining hidden and aiming to generate
physical anomalies in CIs. It is claimed [152] that the Stuxnet was developed by the US and Israel to sabotage Iran’s
uranium enrichment program. However, there was no ofﬁcial conﬁrmation from any sides.

Saudi Aramco Attack [139]. In 2012, the oil and gas manufacturer Saudi Aramco was targeted by a malware attack
later named as Shamoon. Attackers accessed the enterprise network and deployed the malware which deleted data
related to production. It is believed that the attackers also had insider help as deploying that kind of malware requires
physical access to internal computers. The attack failed to access the industrial network. The hacker group named “The
Cutting Sword of Justice” announced that they were behind the attack for political reasons.

Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster [140]. In 2011, the earthquake disrupted Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power
station by damaging power systems that cool the reactors which resulted in radioactive contamination and followed by
the evacuation of around 100,000 residents. Natural disasters are predictable only to some extent. Usually, the risks that
may occur due to these events are ignored when designing ICPS. Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster incident led to the
re-examination of similar facilities to question how safe they are against natural disasters.

Tridium Niagara Framework Attack [141]. In 2012, attackers inﬁltrated the HVAC system of a company located
in the USA. The company was using an older version of Tridium Niagara ICS that contains several vulnerabilities
that allow backdoor access. These vulnerabilities were already published and analyzed by several cybersecurity
organizations. However, the victim company was unaware of the issue. The ICS was connected to the internet with
password protection set up. Attackers gained administration privileges without knowing the password by exploiting the

11

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 12, 2021

already known vulnerability. The attackers did not access any signiﬁcant document and the motivation behind the attack
is unknown.

Target Attack [142]. In 2013, the anomalies in the IT system of TARGET were discovered by a third-party forensic
team. The attackers had accessed the personal information of more than 1,000,000 customers. The list of third-party
vendors that work with Target was already available in Target’s Supplier Portal. The attackers chose Fazio Mechanical
(HVAC manufacturer) and sent a phishing e-mail to one of the employees. They injected malware via a phishing e-mail
and stole the login credentials of Fazio Mechanical. Then, they accessed the enterprise network and stole personal
information with the motivation of ﬁnancial gain. This incident is unique in a way that the attackers accessed the IT
network by comprising the OT network ﬁrst.

Godzilla Attack! Turn Back! [143]. In 2013, the electronic road signs in San Francisco, USA were hacked and
instead of essential messages, they were showing “Godzilla Attack!” and “Turn Back!”. The signs were controlled by
a third-party company that was still using default credentials to access the network. The incident did not cause any
signiﬁcant problems. The company responsible for the signs claimed that the attack was done by someone who already
knew the credentials. It is believed that the motivation behind the attack was just personal entertainment.

Brute Force Attacks on Internet-Facing Control Systems [144]. In 2013, a gas compressor station owner in the
USA alerted ICS-CERT regarding detected increased number of brute force attack attempts on their systems. They
were done from 49 different IP addresses. The threat actors and motivation behind the attacks are still unknown. None
of the attacks were successful. This case is a good example to show how early detection of intrusion attempts prevents
further damage to industrial systems by increasing the possibility of an effective response.

German Steel Mill Cyberattack [145]. In 2014, the blast furnace of a German steel mill was attacked. The attack
resulted in massive physical damage since the furnace could not be shut down. Attackers accessed to the enterprise
network via phishing e-mail then moved into an industrial network and performed malicious code execution to reprogram
several PLCs to compromise the functions of the furnace. They exploited the vulnerabilities resulting from weak
boundary protection between established networks due to lack of DMZ. The attack has been deﬁned as an APT and
believed to be executed by a group that aims intellectual property theft.

Kemuri Water Company Attack [146]. In 2016, Verizon published a report of an attack on a water treatment company
(Verizon named the company as Kemuri to hide its real identity). The company had stored operational control system
credentials on the front-end web server. The adversaries accessed those credentials via SQL injection and phishing.
They managed control actuators but failed to cause any harm due to a lack of expertise on SCADA systems. However, it
is believed that the personal information of around 2,500,000 users was stolen.

Ukrainian Power Grid Attack [147]. In 2015, the electricity distribution company Ukrainian Kyivoblenergo was
subjected to attack resulted in the power outage that affected 225,000 customers. The attackers accessed the IT network
via phishing e-mails, then seized the credentials, and inﬁltrated the industrial network to execute malware named
BlackEnergy 3. They kept attacking the system with 30-minute intervals to prevent mitigation techniques to be deployed.

TRITON [148]. In 2017, the Safety Instrumented System (SIS) of a Middle Eastern oil and gas utility company was
shut down due to the successful execution of malware named TRITON. SIS controller that prevents OT assets from
malfunctioning made by Schneider Electric SE connected to a Windows PC was deactivated due to TRITON leaving
whole utility vulnerable to OT incidents. The attackers ﬁrst inﬁltrated the IT network then moved to the OT that shows
there was weak boundary protection between these networks.

Cryptocurrency Malware Attack on SCADA [149]. In 2018, a malware was discovered on the OT system of a
European water utility company. The malware was designed to mine Monero cryptocurrency by utilizing the HMI
and SCADA servers of the victim. It was able to run in stealth mode, but increased CPU and bandwidth usage were
detected by the IDS. Updating OT systems requires advanced techniques and thus most of the systems cannot get the
latest updates on time. In this case, HMI applications that were not up-to-date were connected to the internet to allow
remote management. Attackers exploited these applications to access the system.

Norsk Hydro Ransomware Attack [150]. In 2019, aluminum manufacturing company Norsk Hydro suffered from
a ransomware attack later named as LockerGoga. The adversaries accessed and encrypted the critical data resulting
in the shutdown of the enterprise network and halt of many operations including order processing. The motivation of
the attack is estimated as disrupting the production and reputation of the company rather than ﬁnancial gain as the
adversaries chose to execute a previously known ransomware attack after gaining access to the system.

Riviera Beach Ransomware Attack [151]. In 2019, the water utilities of Riviera Beach (a small city located in
Florida, USA) were subjected to a ransomware attack. Attackers sent a phishing e-mail to the police department where
the employee opened a malicious link triggered the immediate lockdown of the department computer. The attack spread
to all city networks including water utility systems due to being interconnected to the IT network without any bound

protection mechanisms. The city council agreed to pay the ransom which was 65 Bitcoins (around $600,000 due that
date) however attackers did not send the decryption key. Then the city council decided to change outdated hardware
that was deployed on attacked systems.

Table 5 demonstrates the evaluation of major ICPS incidents based on the ICPS attack taxonomy that we developed.
Our ﬁndings have shown that the most targeted industrial sectors [134] are manufacturing and electricity, gas, steam and
air conditioning supply. Most ICPS attacks are active and organized by nation/state established groups while aiming to
disrupt the data integrity. Also, there are no physical-only attacks among major cases.

The attacks against ICPS mostly include more than one stage while the advanced ones may execute the whole CKC.
Integrating IT and OT networks without providing robust and secure boundary protection is the most exploited case that
has been encountered in ICPS incidents. Attackers mostly target companies that lack security personnel with industrial
security expertise via phishing e-mails. Most of the companies that subject to data breach reject publishing a public
report on incidents to hide their identities. The information on incidents is mostly available through news agencies or
cybersecurity bloggers where they claim getting information via whistle-blowers (e.g., former or current employee with
a pseudonym) that makes further examination harder.

4.3

ICPS Vulnerability Assessment Reports

ICPSs should be treated as if they will be subject to cyberattack any moment. Security professionals need to discover
all vulnerabilities while knowing only one may be enough for an adversary to damage the system. Risk assessment
is required to design an efﬁcient security plan. Risk assessment plans vary for each ICPS as they contain different
assets that are rapidly evolving due to the integration of new technologies. Such research that considers this change and
proposes a risk assessment method for modern smart grids is presented in [153].

Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) [154] analyses vulnerabilities of CIs ranged
from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to large corporations that are located in the USA. The vulnerabilities
are ranked based on The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) [155]. Their industrial vulnerability assessment
reports respectively for 2015 [46] and 2016 [47] outline that the integration of IT to OT causes new vulnerabilities while
most of them are related to weak boundary protection. Weak boundaries between OT and IT (enterprise) networks may
result in unauthorized access. Establishing an industrial demilitarized zone (IDMZ) [156] is one way to mitigate such a
problem. Table 6 illustrates the key ﬁndings from these reports.

Cyber Kill Chain (CKC) [157] is a widely accepted framework created by Lockheed Martin in 2011 that identiﬁes the
stages of a successful cyberattack. The CKC developed by SANS [158] is more precise and applicable for ICPS in
general. Successful delivery of CKC to ICPS results in a data breach that may trigger catastrophic failures. Figure
8 illustrates the key ﬁndings from Verizon’s [45] data breach report where only 4% of the total conﬁrmed breaches
belonged to the OT systems. However, the results of 4% may have a bigger impact than the rest (96% IT-related
breaches).

Figure 8: Key ﬁndings from Verizon’s 2020 data breach report [45]. 381 data breaches (10% of total) are against
industrial systems where not all of them target OT equipment. Financial gain is the main reason behind 86% of attacks
where most likely they are carried out by organized groups which form 55% of total threat actors. DoS is the most
preferred attack method due to the availability of unsupervised many IoT devices as seen in the Mirai Botnet [159]
incident.

4.4 Countermeasures Against Most Common ICPS Vulnerabilities

Figure 9 displays the top ten ICPS vulnerabilities accounting for 45.90% of the total in 2016 [47]. While boundary
protection is the most common vulnerability, it is followed by weak authentication mechanisms. Integrating IT systems
to OT by utilizing the latest available technologies to increase the processing efﬁciency of factories without properly
preparing and complying with security plans, policies, and procedures cause new vulnerabilities that can be exploited
by threat actors. The industrial cybersecurity reports [46, 47, 45] we have examined determine the direction of
cybersecurity studies being funded by security companies, research councils, and state establishments. This allows
the rapid development of security techniques that provide the deployment of new defence mechanisms. Now, we
review academic studies that present such techniques as a solution to the top ten common vulnerabilities (see Figure 9)
identiﬁed by ICS-CERT based on the NIST classiﬁcation [55]. We evaluate related studies in the literature based on
several characteristics illustrated in Table 7 that increase the industrial practicality of these proposals.

4.4.1 Boundary Protection

The boundary between IT and OT networks in ICPS is fading away due to increased connectivity. Weak boundaries
pose a great risk as seen in the past cyber incidents [145, 146, 151]. Establishing a DMZ that contains protection
mechanisms including a ﬁrewall is the ﬁrst step to strengthen these boundaries. However, even DMZ itself is prone
to attacks. [160]. Mazur et al. [156] deﬁnes the requirements of a DMZ while discussing if it is needed for mining
applications. Jiang et al. [161] simulate a DMZ using Riverbed Modeler to evaluate performance factors regarding
defense-in-depth strategy. Hassan et al. [162] develop IDS based on a semi-supervised deep learning model to provide

Figure 9: Illustrates the top ten vulnerabilities seen in industrial environments. Vulnerabilities are not isolated from
each other. One weakness of ICPS may be a reason for several vulnerabilities. Attacks against CIs target altering the
integrity of data ﬁrst compromise the conﬁdentiality. Therefore, an adversary checks for conﬁdentiality vulnerabilities
before engaging in malicious activity. While the current most signiﬁcant issue is providing boundary protection when
integrating new IT technologies to OT, others are mostly present due to a lack of enforcement of well-designed security
policies.

boundary protection while proposing a framework of attack strategies that target IIoT networks. They evaluate their
model on a real-life IIoT network testbed.

4.4.2 Least Functionality

The interconnected heterogeneous industrial network contains a variety of system functions (e.g., port, protocol, and
services) that keep the main processing units running. Least functionality refers to prohibiting and restricting the usage
of these to prevent potential abuse. The industrial companies tend to ignore security due to focusing on reducing cost,
hence, resulting in the least functionality vulnerabilities. Cao et al. [163] discuss this issue and propose the random
multipath routing model that minimizes the required number of paths to reduce the least functionality vulnerabilities.
They utilize that model to provide a security-oriented node deployment framework optimized by a distributed parallel
algorithm. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is another method that addresses optimized node deployment. Ling
et al. [164] propose such an enhanced PSO method that may be utilized for real-world industrial systems to improve
efﬁciency and security aspects. They apply 17 benchmarking tests to evaluate the proposed model and compare it with
previously developed PSO methods while also evaluating their performance on economic load dispatch (ELD) that
schedules power generator outputs according to load demands.

4.4.3 Identiﬁcation and Authentication

Applying proper authentication mechanisms in an industrial environment prevents unauthorized access while easing
data circulation. Authenticating human-to-machine or machine-to-machine (M2M) communications requires prior
identiﬁcation. Unidentiﬁed entities in such environments are prohibited from acting. By faking sensor data, an
adversary can damage the ICPS while preventing intrusion detection. Authentication mechanisms are deployed to
the edge to prevent such an act. Li et al. [165] discuss that deploying traditional authentication mechanisms to the
resource-constrained environment of sensor nodes poses a challenge and propose a privacy-preserving secure biometrics-
based authentication scheme for IIoT. They do the testing via simulation by considering authentication based security
properties (e.g., password change, wrong password detection). Esfahani et al. [166] emphasize that and proposes a
lightweight authentication scheme for M2M protocols. Their scheme has two steps: each sensor is registered to the
system via an authentication server, then mutual authentication is provided. Das et al. [167] propose a biometrics-based
user authentication scheme for a cloud-based IIoT model that deployed in manufacturing sites while preserving privacy.

4.4.4 Physical Access Control

Access to industrial facilities is provided via keys, electronic cards, and mobile technologies. While physical keys are
subject to theft, electronic cards and mobile technologies (i.e., smart locks) are prone to forging. Ho et al. [168] discuss
the security of smart locks by modeling with different threat models. They address how current COTS smart locks

are vulnerable to state consistency and relay attacks. They propose a touch-based authentication scheme where the
communication is provided via bone conduction. Mudholkar et al. [169] brieﬂy introduce biometrics and propose a
ﬁngerprint-based authentication mechanism. They claim access to a computer can be provided via ﬁngerprint scanners
instead of a password to improve overall security. Mock et al. [170] address that the real-time continuous authentication
mechanisms provide better security. They develop an iris recognition authentication model based on a commercial eye
tracker and claim the current error rate is too high to be used as a standalone mechanism.

4.4.5 Audit Review and Analysis

Organizations should adopt Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system as an operational whole
log management mechanism. However, the adversary can organize decoy attacks to occupy SIEM. Thus, prioritizing
alerts is an important task. Sancho et al. [171] propose a threat level rating model that evaluates the SIEM output. The
authors classify threats and assign four priority levels: critical, important, moderate, and low. First, they perform a data
balancing to real-life datasets and then evaluate the proposed model on balanced datasets. They compare the proposed
model with commercial software to validate. Due to available limited processing power, an in-depth analysis of ICPS
edge data is challenging. Tao et al. [172] discuss these issues and proposes a secure event detection scheme for ICPS
while providing a data validation algorithm. They test their system on a real-world dataset and claim that the proposed
scheme is adequate to secure data transmission in ICPSs. Huang et al. [173] propose a data historian based on the
IBM Informix database for Big Data management. The authors develop an IIoT data management benchmark (named
as IOT-X) by utilizing two relational databases to evaluate their design. They claim the proposed system offers high
efﬁciency compared to traditional historians.

4.4.6 Authenticator Management

Three essential principles that must be regulated by password enforcement policies are password change, removal, and
encryption. Password change. COTS ICPS devices like PLCs come with a default password that is assigned by the
vendor. Thus, it poses a great risk and a new password should be set (see [137] for real-life incident example) before
device deployment while being reset at random intervals. Password removal. Due to the severity of the operations
and availability concerns memorizing a password is not feasible in industrial environments. Therefore, the passwords
belong to operational devices are stored in a local/cloud database. When an employee is no longer associated with
the organization, the linked password should be removed from the database to prevent possible abuse. Password
encryption. Strong encryption mechanisms need to be applied to secure passwords starting from the authentication
step. If the password is transmitted or kept as plain text, an adversary can access it in case of an intrusion. Sarkar et al.
[174] address that the password policies for traditional IT networks can be applied to ICPS where the environment
contains unique devices such as PLC and RTU. They propose a security-oriented password policy for ICPS with a
detailed password creating guideline. Korman et al. [160] evaluate the effectiveness of several ICPS cybersecurity
countermeasures including password policy enforcement. Authors analyze the available CPS security assessment tools
based on three techniques: network segregation, strengthened access control, and patch management. They claim
password policy enforcement complement network segmentation to secure CPSs.

4.4.7 Least Privilege

NIST [55] suggests applying the least privilege principle as a part of the defense-in-depth strategy for ICPS. It provides
minimal access to a software/user required for essential tasks when needed, while the task number is being kept at the
minimum. This provides easy to analyze systems with higher overall security. Least privilege can be provided via the
application of role-based access control (RBAC) that assigns certain access rights to dedicated roles. Such a work is
presented in [175] where authors implement RBAC to the industrial remote maintenance system. They evaluate the
proposed system on Raspberry Pi 3 by setting up virtual hosts. They claim such an implementation as a standalone
security mechanism can be implemented to remote maintenance systems as a countermeasure against zero-day attacks.
Another work [176] evaluates the use of Software-deﬁned networking (SDN) switches to implement the least principle
scheme for ICPS. Authors address the cybersecurity requirements on [55] as a motivation of their work while discussing
how to implement NIST suggested mitigation techniques via SDN switches. They test the proposed system via two
different SDN switches (real-life testbed) and claim ICPS can beneﬁt in terms of least privilege networking from such
an implementation.

4.4.8 Allocation of Resources

Due to increasing interconnectivity, providing a secure environment for ICPS is becoming more resource-demanding.
Smeraldi and Malacaria [177] discuss the question of how to optimize the cybersecurity budget spending. They
apply the knapsack problem and develop an optimization model for two different cases: multiple targets and separate

16

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 12, 2021

resources, multiple targets and shared resources. They claim such a combinational optimization can be applied for
resource allocation. Another model for this issue is presented by Wang [178]. The author utilizes mathematical cyber
breach probability models to develop a function as a solution to the resource allocation problem. They address that the
organizations can beneﬁt if they apply the least privilege principle and access authentication schemes before allocating
security resources. Srinidhi et al. [179] analyze the resource allocation problem from the manager’s perspective and
claim that managers tend to over-invest speciﬁc security methods that are effective in the short run due to ﬁnancial
distress that they are faced with while investors prefer more productive ways that are more effective in the long run.
They propose a resource allocation decision-support model for managers and investors utilized in case of a breach.

4.4.9 Account Management

Additional accounts in ICPS networks are used in exceptional (e.g., error, intrusion) situations. These tempo-
rary/emergency accounts may have access to critical assets. Hence, they need to be removed/disabled once their
use is completed. Such an action should be regulated by an access control policy. Valenzano [180] proposes a role-based
twofold access control policy model for industrial systems. The author emphasizes the difﬁculty of validating access
policy enforcement. Thus, most solutions in this context either assume that the policy is either enforced or propose
an additional software/hardware extensions. The model proposed by the author clearly outlines the usage conditions
on edge mechanisms. Ren et al. [181] utilize blockchain technology to implement identity management and access
control to edge IIoT mechanisms. The access control policy is deﬁned by the edge network terminal, hence automated.
Their evaluation shows that the proposed model can efﬁciently work in the IIoT edge which is a resource-constrained
environment.

4.4.10 Remote Access

The integration of cloud technology to OT and rapid advancements in IWSNs have been a huge steppingstone for IIoT
and allowed feasible remote monitoring/management within the ICPS. RTUs that gather data from edge sensors are
converted to remote substations with the integration of IWSN where the data is accessed and forwarded to a designated
point via remote management. However, providing an additional access point increases the attack surface thus new
security measures should be set based on security-oriented integration strategy before or when enabling remote access.
Alcaraz et al. [182] discuss how to securely integrate IWSN with the internet to provide ubiquitous management for
ICPS. Authors address two main challenges: available limited local access options, and the trade-off between real-time
performance and security. They analyze the integration strategies and mechanisms from both efﬁciency and security
perspective while addressing internet connection is not required to build remote accessible IWSN. Sadeghi et al. [35]
discuss that security has become a hot topic after the integration of IT systems to IIoT that offers remote monitoring and
control. They mention future management of IIoT will be challenging due to rapidly increasing heterogeneity that will
generate large data. They claim only cloud-based services are capable of processing large data in real-time. However,
using cloud services for industrial tasks may raise privacy concerns. Anand and Regi [183] propose a remote water
level monitoring design. Authors discuss how current remote access technologies lack modern security mechanisms.
They claim existing security measurements for GSM and LTE may be a solution for these issues and can be utilized for
remote monitoring while being adapted to IIoT. They also mention that the security of remote access concepts depends
on the communication protocol choice.

4.5

ICPS Cybersecurity Characteristics

The most sophisticated cyber attacks (e.g., Stuxnet, TRITON) in history targets CIs that are managed by ICPS. Therefore,
the concept of defense-in-depth must be applied to all assets contained in CIs. Defense-in-depth can be provided via
establishing several defense layers where each layer serves for a certain purpose while the main objective is to provide a
secure environment. These layers may differ for technical assets (e.g., hardware, software) while showing similarities in
terms of personnel and procedures. Secure industrial environment that is designed based on defense-in-depth approach
should contain the following characteristics that complement each other:

Robustness. All systems are prone to fail. Robustness determines how much a system can endure before failing. This is
a signiﬁcant security feature for each asset in industrial environments due to the cascading effect observed in highly
interconnected ICPS. The robustness of a system should be tested whenever a change is made to the system. Even
though there are not any known changes, periodically testing is required as some of the components may degrade
over time. Fuzz testing [184] such as Netﬂix’s Simian Army approach [185] can be implemented to evaluate ICPS
robustness.

Resilience. We can shut down IT systems whenever an anomaly is detected. However, this is not valid for OT systems
as they are supervising CIs, they need to be kept operating even when there is an intrusion. Resilience determines how

long does it take for the system to fully recover after an anomaly. SDN [186, 187] is one of the techniques that may be
utilized to develop models that contain routing algorithms to increase resiliency in ICPSs.

Redundancy. If we can answer the question of what happens when one sensor fails during the manufacturing process
with the back-up sensor activates and keeps reporting, that means we designed a redundant system. The edge monitoring
mechanism of ICPS consists of a sensor that supervises production line assets such as robotic arm, conveyor belt, gas
tank, and oven. The data taken from these are either sent to the command and control (C&C) center to be checked by
the control engineer or handled by autonomous control units. The ﬁnal phase of the attack against ICPS includes faking
sensor values to delay the activation of SIS. This can be prevented via deploying additional layers of sensors under
the context of increasing redundancy. Therefore, even though it is not directly mentioned when designing optimized
systems, redundancy is one of the main factors that is considered. Such an example is presented in [188].

4.6 Securing ICPS Edge Network

The real-life ICPS incident evaluation (see §4.2) has shown that most adversaries target edge network/mechanisms
by either exploiting weak boundary protection mechanisms (i.e., accessing OT assets from IT domain) (see §4.4.1)
or inﬁltrating other ICPS elements (e.g., HMIs, PLCs) as the main motivation behind the attacks to maximize given
damage by disrupting actuator behaviours [137, 138, 145, 148]. Therefore, their ﬁrst step after breaching the system
is to fake sensor readings to bypass deployed anomaly detection mechanisms. Thus, even though the vulnerability
assessment reports [46, 47, 45] show that the most common ICPS vulnerabilities based on weak boundary protection
mechanisms, as the ﬁnal aim of the adversary to disrupt ICPS edge network, efﬁcient security mechanisms that
feature key cybersecurity characteristics (see §4.5 and detect the anomalies in physical behaviours (e.g., change in the
temperature, pressure, fan behaviour) should be deployed to the edge. The evaluation based on real-life testbeds and
datasets generate the most realistic results for such research. Now we brieﬂy summarize the latest research related to
ICPS edge security based on the ﬁndings of previous surveys/works (see Table 1).

Edge Anomaly Detection. Giraldo et al. [32] survey the physics-based attack detection techniques in cyber-physical
systems and propose a taxonomy to evaluate related research. Their key ﬁndings include: (i) the vast majority of papers

18

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 12, 2021

do not share common evaluation metrics and do not simultaneously utilize simulation, testbed, and real-world data, (ii)
the cases when adversaries in control are ignored. The authors emphasize that the anomaly detection monitor should be
deployed to the edge and not just to the central network while proposing new evaluation metrics that can be applied to
a variety of anomaly detection algorithms. Ramotsoela et al. [34] survey the anomaly detection methods utilized for
IWSNs. The authors mention that the trade-off between detection accuracy and power consumption is one of the main
issues to be considered while the other one is the lack of training data. They emphasize the high cost and inability to
evaluate complex ML algorithms are the main drawbacks of IWSN testbeds. Besides, many papers utilize simulation
programs, hence, we can conclude that the access to these testbeds is also questionable. Shah and Tiwari [189] apply
anomaly detection by utilizing several machine learning techniques on data gathered from real-life industrial machines.
The authors conclude that while in some use cases the anomalies can be detected via statistical analysis, others require
machine learning techniques. They mention the data deviation due to external reasons (e.g., at the start, malfunctioning,
being idle, degradation) occurs more than expected so should be considered when training the ML model.

ICPS Testbeds. McLaughlin et al. [190] summarize the required features of an efﬁcient ICPS testbed and emphasize
that the hardware is a must for an ICPS testbed, hence, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbeds are better at simulating
real-world cases. The authors also mention that the HIL testbeds are becoming standard for vulnerability assessment
thanks to their increasing numbers and allowing the testing of cyber-physical components. Yamin et al. [191] propose
an extensive survey regarding security testbeds. The authors conﬁrm that the interest in security testbeds (emulation,
simulation, hybrid, or real) is increasing. However, the efﬁciency of these testbeds is questionable due to the lack of
quantitative and qualitative analysis. Holm et al. [192] review 30 ICS testbeds based on the evaluation metrics deﬁned
by Siaterlis et al. [193] which are ﬁdelity, repeatability, measurement accuracy, and safe execution of tests. The authors
describe ﬁdelity is the most key characteristic as it deﬁnes the accuracy of the testbed. However, only 4 of the works
discuss the ﬁdelity of the testbeds based on the standards [55]. Also, the objectives of the testbeds are deﬁned in
detail. Hence, the authors emphasize the need for a comprehensive evaluation framework to be utilized to compare the
available ICS testbeds.

ICPS Datasets. Mitchell and Chen [22] survey 28 papers that propose IDS for CPS based on the detection technique
and audit material. 24 out of 28 papers utilize datasets while 22 of them do not share them. 6 papers use simulated
datasets rather than operational ones. The authors also deﬁne physical process monitoring is one of the key aspects
of intrusion detection. Khraisat et al. [194] review the IDS datasets. The authors mention that the utilization of older
datasets accepted as benchmarks results in inaccurate claims due to their lack of current sophisticated malware. Thus,
there is a need for an up-to-date publicly available dataset. Ahmed et al. [195] also propose such a survey. The authors
claim that the real reason behind the lack of publicly available datasets is privacy-related issues. They also ﬁnd the
usage of older datasets problematic. They emphasize the importance of dual optimization to achieve simpler datasets.
Zolanvari et al. [196] study the place of ML techniques in IIoT. The authors emphasize that the anomalies correspond to
around 1% of the total data in real-life cases, hence causing the generation of imbalanced datasets. However, training
ML models via imbalanced datasets cause generation of inaccurate security mechanisms and the techniques (e.g.,
oversampling, undersampling) used to overcome this issue have their drawbacks.

The utilization of ML techniques to detect anomalies in industrial systems is favored by academia. However, there
are still many challenges to be addressed including operating in resource-constrained environments, and dealing with
anomalies resulted from non-adversary events. The increase in the number of testbeds (e.g, physical, simulation, HIL,
emulation and virtualisation) is another positive development, however the access to cyber-physical testbeds that provide
the most realistic results is questionable as more research is done via simulation only testbeds. The older datasets that
are accepted as benchmarks are still widely used even though they do not present the current cybersecurity environment.
Privacy is the main concern behind the lack of up-to-date public datasets. Besides, evaluating works that do not release
the utilized dataset is more challenging.

5 LESSONS LEARNED

Dissimilar to IT security, industrial security is still in early development and gradually adapting to scientiﬁc research.
Integration of IT systems and the rapid development of technologies based on ubiquitous computing (e.g., IIoT, IWSN)
that increases the overall efﬁciency, heterogeneity, and interconnectivity of industrial systems makes the currently
available security measures inadequate. We make the following observations based on our review: (i) the relationship
between emerging new industrial technologies requires clariﬁcation, (ii) industrial cybersecurity policy based solutions
lack common evaluation framework, (iii) non-adaptive cybersecurity solutions lose validity over time, (iv) security
policies and redundant solutions are overlooked, (v) inefﬁcient realistic testbed and up-to-date dataset utilization. We
now examine these in detail.

19

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 12, 2021

Confusion over lack of classiﬁcation. New terms emerge from new technologies. To prevent confusion and overlapping,
we need to clarify the relationship of such terms (e.g., ICS, IIoT, IWSN, WSAN, SCADA, DCS, and IWoT) with the
other complementary industrial disciplines. We only have deﬁned the ICS, IIoT, and IWSN other than ICPS because we
ﬁnd relevant studies in the literature. However, we have not provided a clear distinction as it requires further study.
The classiﬁcation framework that explicitly states the relationship of terms that are used to deﬁne systems located in
industrial environments will prevent the diversion of complementary future industrial research.

Industrial cybersecurity policy-based solutions lack common evaluation ground and framework. While the top
industrial cybersecurity vulnerabilities occur due to weak boundary protection, they are followed by security policy-
based weaknesses (e.g., least functionality, identiﬁcation and authentication, physical access control, authenticator
management, least privilege) that can be evaluated under the access control policies. Implementing such a policy on a
real ICPS environment while simulating attacks and observing for a certain period may be the most realistic way to
evaluate, however, disrupting an ICPS is not acceptable due to supervision of critical tasks. Several proposed solutions
apply hardware extensions to enforce these policy-based models but the efﬁciency of these methods is questionable due
to the lack of an evaluation framework.

Non-adaptive cybersecurity solutions/taxonomies lose validity. Legacy air-gapped ICPS had a static structure that was
built from components expected to work at least 15 years without any signiﬁcant changes. However, current ICPS are
dynamic due to constantly adopting new components/technologies. Besides, suitable components (e.g., PLC, HMI) are
updated when a vulnerability is discovered to prevent further abuse. Our real-life incident evaluation has shown that
outdated security mechanisms are the main reason for the data breach. However, redeploying is not feasible as they are
obliged to non-stop monitor critical tasks. Thus, we need ﬂexible, adaptive solutions that can continue to operate with
minimum human intervention. Such solutions can only be produced via utilizing testbed, dataset, and machine learning
algorithms.

Inefﬁcient realistic testbed and up-to-date dataset utilization. Even though there are many realistic testbeds available,
the evaluation that shows how close they mimic their real-life counterparts is hard to ﬁnd. Besides, the vast majority
of research that focus on ICPS, and CPS anomaly detection prefer simulation only testbeds and the evaluation phase
mostly contain only one type of testbed rather than combining several ones. Hence, we can question the accessibility of
these realistic testbeds. The issue regarding datasets is the lack of publicly available ones that include network trafﬁc
containing latest malware. Also, many research do not release the dataset they utilize, hence, making it hard to compare
with similar works.

A lack of security policy studies and redundant solutions. Humans are the weakest link in the information security
chain. Enforcing security policies is the most feasible solution to prevent human-centric errors/misuses. However, our
study has shown while academia heavily favors developing intrusion detection systems (post-attack), it lacks in terms of
security policy based studies (pre-attack). On the other hand, redundant systems are also overlooked. We have realized
while most papers focus on resilience and robustness while slightly mentioning redundancy.

6 Research Challenges and Directions

In this section, we identify the research challenges derived from the evaluation of this survey. Our ﬁndings show that
there are challenges in the ﬁeld of ICPS cybersecurity that are based on the lack of adequate evaluation/test environments
that utilize up-to-date datasets, variety of testbeds while adapting uniﬁed evaluation methods. Thus, novel techniques
should be employed to provide adequate solutions for these unique challenges where the "uniqueness" comes from
being in an "industrial" environment adopting recent ubiquitous computing and communication technologies. We
illustrate an ideal ICPS evaluation environment as a solution to these challenges that are based on the future directions
derived from our survey in Figure 10.

6.1 Adaptability and Context Awareness

Cybersecurity is now one of the most dynamic disciplines due to the high interest of large entities (i.e., states/nations)
in cybercrime. The vulnerability assessments reports we analyzed have shown that ICPS cyber incidents (as similar in
[149]) occur due to the utilization of out of date security mechanisms. These non-adaptive cybersecurity mechanisms
are prone to fail before attacks utilizing the newest methods (e.g., zero-day attacks, APTs). ICPSs that consist of
continuous processes require real-time supervision (by sensors) without human intervention. Hence, the deployed
cybersecurity mechanisms should provide adaptive, autonomous, and non-stop protection. These challenges are also
valid for cyberattack taxonomies. Hence, we have proposed an adaptive ICPS attack taxonomy. However, the validity
of our taxonomy depends on CAPEC [118] and it may not reﬂect all characteristics of speciﬁc industrial applications.

20

A PREPRINT - JANUARY 12, 2021

Figure 10: Example of an ideal ICPS evaluation environment. Four testbeds with different contexts are present. Each
testbed is supervised by context-aware sensors connected to the main network and edge nodes deployed on an isolated
network connected to the cloud. The control center monitors and manages each testbed. Simian Army [185] approach
is applied to conduct attacks so we can generate a robust synthetic dataset that contains mixed network trafﬁc. The
adaptability is present thanks to context-aware sensors/edge nodes while edge notes also provide redundancy.

Context-awareness [197] is a promising feature that we expect to see in further adaptive ICPS edge security related
studies. The AI/ML algorithms are utilized to develop ML models that consist several steps including data gathering,
parsing, and training. Current ML models/workﬂows are automated via machine learning pipelines based on open-
source frameworks or cloud ML services to simulate interconnected environment and achieve realistic results. Due
to carrying out these processes in an accessible cyber environment, these models are prone to adversarial machine
learning techniques [198] (e.g., model exploratory, data poisoning attacks) that aim to sabotage training process. Thus,
the required precautions should be taken during the ML process to prevent such attacks. We also believe adversarial
machine learning can be adapted to Simian Army [185] approach in the context of attack generation.

6.2 Redundancy and Resilience

Among the characteristics that determine the overall security of an ICPS, the most overlooked one is a redundancy (see
§4.5) that also directly contributes to the resilience of the system. The German Steel Mill incident [145] is such an
example of to lack of redundancy where the incident could have been prevented if there was an additional system to shut
down the furnace. Regarding resilience, imagine the rotating speed of the fan is altered by an adversary to cause a ﬁre in
the manufacturing line. If the fan can go back to a normal state without causing ﬁre we can deﬁne that system as resilient.
In industrial environments, only the most signiﬁcant elements (i.e., electricity) are considered from these perspectives
where cyber-physical edge security mechanisms subject to replacement when they fail which makes the ICPS vulnerable
during the replacement process. Deploying an alternative system for each process is not a feasible option (in most
situations, the cost will be too high) due to the heterogeneity of an industrial environment. The same is also applied
to industrial networks. As we mentioned in §2, ICPSs may beneﬁt from a highly interconnected network that also
increases the attack surface (see [151] for real-life incident example). This case becomes more signiﬁcant when there is
inadequate boundary protection (see §4.4) as we have also seen from the vulnerability assessment reports [47, 45, 46].
Thus, two main challenges arise: (i) how can we determine the industrial assets that require back-up systems, (ii)
how should we implement them. The risk assessment has to be done to analyze available options. Regarding ICPS
edge resources, we may question the abandonment of air-gapping policy in ICPSs. Deploying supervision/security
mechanisms to the same network allows the adversary to bypass them by manipulating their outputs forwarded to the
control center [152]. Thus, deploying edge security mechanisms on an air-gapped secondary network seems like a
promising further research topic.

6.3 Testbeds and Synthetic Datasets

The survey revealed that most of the proposals targeting the top ten identiﬁed industrial weaknesses [47] utilize
benchmarking tests, simulations, or proof of concepts to evaluate their proposals. To achieve the most realistic results,
real-life datasets and testbeds are required. This is a well-known challenge for industrial studies that exist from the
beginning. Experimenting on real and active ICPS is out of the question due to the chance of possible disruption in CIs.
Hence, aiming for the utilization of the most realistic testbeds and synthetic datasets [199, 200] that beneﬁt from being
privacy-free (the reason behind the lack of efﬁcient publicly available datasets) and safe to gather is the most feasible
option. We believe the development of advanced industrial simulation environments [201] that can generate robust
synthetic datasets to be utilized with machine learning models is one of the signiﬁcant future directions to be considered.
To generate such a dataset where the privacy of the data is out of concern that contains both malicious and normal trafﬁc,
either we can conduct attacks (a similar approach to the Simian Army [185] may be applied) or deploy honeypot to the
ICPS testbed network. However, achieving big data is still a challenge with in terms of generating synthetic datasets.
On the other hand, realistic evaluation becomes more challenging if we consider the studies regarding industrial security
policies where the efﬁciency of the policy is mostly determined by the aftermath of the real attacks. Possible directions
include simulating real-life incidents based on the choices of developed policies and the development of an evaluation
framework that differs according to industrial environments.

7 Conclusions

The industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) are adopting new communication, computation based technologies, and
becoming more interconnected, heterogeneous, and dynamic. Even though ICPS beneﬁts from this rapid integration,
providing cybersecurity is becoming a primary concern due to increased attack surface. In this paper, we reviewed the
overall ICPS cybersecurity to understand what the current challenges are and how they are treated by the academia. We
analyzed the ICPS architecture by deﬁning its components and emphasizing the unique characteristic of OT systems.
We provided an analysis of ICPS communication protocols. We proposed an adaptive attack taxonomy then evaluated
real-life ICPS cyber incidents. We analyzed the latest trends on ICPS edge security. Then, we surveyed the growing
ICPS cybersecurity literature to determine how academia approaches against ICPS vulnerabilities. We evaluated studies
that propose ICPS security mechanisms based on the evaluation metrics that aim for continuity. We argued about
the datasets, testbeds, machine learning techniques, security policies that will shape the future of ICPS security. In
all papers we surveyed, no paper proposes a framework that explains the relationship with complementary industrial
systems. The less utilization of realistic testbeds, lack of up-to-date datasets, and evaluation framework to compare
AI/ML techniques are also among major challenges. Besides, the most common vulnerabilities are either due to weak
boundary protection or lack of enforcement of well-designed security policy. We hope that our review and suggestions
will motivate further research while closing the gap between academia and industry in this ﬁeld and lead uniﬁed studies
that focus on adaptive security mechanisms based on strong policies.
