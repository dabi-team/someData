Access to resources by users may need to be granted only upon certain conditions and contexts, perhaps particularly
in cyber-physical settings. Unfortunately, creating and modifying context-sensitive access control solutions in dynamic
environments creates ongoing challenges to manage the authorization contexts. This paper proposes RASA, a context-
sensitive access authorization approach and mechanism leveraging unsupervised machine learning to automatically infer
risk-based authorization decision boundaries. We explore RASA in a healthcare usage environment, wherein cyber and
physical conditions create context-specific risks for protecting private health information. The risk levels are associated with
access control decisions recommended by a security policy. A coupling method is introduced to track coexistence of the objects
within context using frequency and duration of coexistence, and these are clustered to reveal sets of actions with common risk
levels; these are used to create authorization decision boundaries. In addition, we propose a method for assessing the risk level
and labelling the clusters with respect to their corresponding risk levels. We evaluate the promise of RASA-generated policies
against a heuristic rule-based policy. By employing three different coupling features (frequency-based, duration-based, and
combined features), the decisions of the unsupervised method and that of the policy are more than 99% consistent.

INTRODUCTION

Whether access should be granted to a resource may depend upon the context in which the access is attempted,
including the cyberphysical context. For example, a physician may have a legitimate need to access a patient’s
private health information (PHI) on a mobile display screen while in a private consultation room, but it might be
important to lock out the access if the physician wheels the display into the hallway, or if a different patient
is moved into the shared room. Failure to lock out could lead to leaking PHI to other people who the patient
has not consented to allow access to. In such cases the identity of the accessing physician has not changed, nor

has the physician’s role changed with respect to the patient. The concern is thus unrelated to authentication and
static user roles. Instead, it is an issue of context-dependent or context-sensitive authorization.

Recently, context-aware security approaches have gained significant attention, and there have been several
studies around inferring and understanding contexts. But even state-of-the-art access control mechanisms for
cyber-physical systems may lack the generality or flexibility desired to confine access authorization to dynamic
cyberphysical context, or they otherwise burden the access policy administrators with having to tediously and
continuously define every context, set the appropriate access restrictions, and understand the resulting policy
well enough to assess the residual risks left by the policy. For example, methods for defining geofences may
be used to define physical contexts for defining context-dependent access policy, but many geofencing access
policies utilize geofences only for authorization decisions, and physical location is one contextual factor affecting
authorization risks. For example, a phone may lock when moved out of its ”home” geofence, but unlocking
restores all prior access, it is only used for context-dependent authentication.

A general framework and approach is required for effective context-dependent authorization policy man-
agement. Core concerns in any such context-dependent authorization regime is defining the contexts in which
authorization decisions differ, identifying and quantifying risks for those contexts, and then using the derived risk
model to create appropriate access control decisions. Given that contexts may change over time, an additional
burden is tracking these changing contexts over time. A problem that is not yet well addressed are effective
methods for automatically helping define and maintain context-dependent authorization policies, i.e., inferring
the contexts, risk models, and access decision boundaries.

This paper introduces a framework named Risk-Aware Smart Access (RASA) to learn authentication policies
from examples of routine access. RASA begins with the observation that if, in normal practice, responsible
actors access information they have ordinary access to only in those contexts in which the need access, and
that they take care to guard against known risks. In such cases, even if an existing access control policy is not
context-sensitive, responsible actors effectively fill in the missing contextual access conditions through their
choices and actions, and these can be used to infer a baseline context-dependent access control policy. In a sense,
they can program the context-dependent access conditions by demonstration. RASA uses coupling of access
actions to identify patterns of access, clusters the actions, associates these coupling-defined features to risk scores,
and then defines access boundaries based simply on these risk scores. To the best of our knowledge, no prior
work exists for similar automated policy inference based on mapping inferred contexts onto risk levels.

The paper evaluates the general promise of the approach in a simulated in-person healthcare environment.
This use context is cyberphysical, and one where ensuring strong access boundaries–even for fully authenticated
users–are critical for protecting sensitive PHI. Nearly 90% of participants, in a health care survey reported by the
Ponemon Institute, have been affected by data leakage in the past three years [22]. Furthermore, inappropriate use
of devices that handle sensitive document by internal employees has led to the breach of 4.5M patient records in
2015 [14]. Intelligent approaches to such security may be increasingly important [30], and not all risks are due to
remote attackers–shoulder surfing in a shared patient room, for example. The context-dependent appropriateness
of PHI access serves as a suitable test of cyberphysical context dependencies.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work and motivation are presented. In Section 3, we
present our proposed framework in detail. Section 4 presents the numerical results of three different coupling
mechanisms and clustering algorithms along with comprehensive discussions. Finally Section 5 concludes the
paper and provides future directions.

2 BACKGROUND, RELATED WORK, AND MOTIVATION

Some traditional authentication schemes, such as passwords or pincodes, can be inconvenient for some users.
They also have well-known limitations to their effective security; for example, passwords set by mobile users can

Risk-Aware Fine-Grained Access Control in Cyber-Physical Contexts

be determined by simple guessing [1], inferred from smudges left on users’ screens [5], or stolen by malware [6].
These concerns have lead to plentiful prior work in cyberphysical context-dependencies for access control that
has applied context dependency to multi-factor authentication, location-aware access control, and implicit or
continuous authentication.

Multi-factor authentication establishes likely identity of users based on at least two pieces of evidences of
identity, making identity assessment dependent upon multiple possibly-contextual factors. Commonly, the factors
relate to a users’ unique knowledge (such as a private password), and physical possessions (something that is only
in possession of the user such as a SecureID token). Common also is adding physical location to the authentication
through definitions of geofences, such as a defined “home” location. Ramatsakane et al. [33] utilized location for
improving accuracy of identity determination for authentication purposes.

So-called “implicit” authentication extends multi-factor one-time authentication could be more usable and
secure [12, 24]. State of the art in context-aware access control calls for a system for continuous authentication
that factors contextual risk into the continuous authentication in addition to other risks, such as the risk that
the user is not who they appear to be, or that the resource being accessed is more sensitive than another
[31]. Thanks to the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors can be utilized for easy-to-use
additional access safeguards, such as through contextual, behavioral, and biometric signatures [32]. In particular,
Internet of Things (IoT) devices and networks may be effective in recognizing certain context, as in the case
of using sensors, communication and data (i.e. storage and analytics) as keys to IoT-based smart systems [16].
As Habibzadeh et al. [17] note, security is increasingly critical in smart access systems. Significant work on
behavioural authentication has been published recently using a growing list of features collected through sensors
including, but not limited to: smartphone touchscreens, wearables, and keystrokes [9, 38, 39].

Ashibani et al. [3] propose a framework which aims to reduce user intervention in access control by identifying
the behavioral patterns about user-device interaction, such as service request and login duration. Rule-based
behavior analysis aims for resiliency against password misuse, brute force attacks and unauthorized modification.
Rauen et al. [35] proposed a primary-backup fashion to manage access control on smart mobile devices by using
several machine learning algorithms that run on gestural information and spatiotemporal knowledge extracted
from sessions on various applications. Thus, once the primary authentication module fails to authenticate a
user (or fails to recognize a behavioral pattern), the backup module is activated. In case both primary and
backup modules fails to authenticate a user implicitly, multi-factor authentication is triggered. Wu et.al [42]
apply Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify genuine users as well as adversaries from keystroke signals.
Lima et al. [28] introduced an architecture for behavioural data acquisition, and presented a behavior model
with the building blocks of events, context, action and behavior. The architecture utilizes a belief analyzer and a
recommendation filter to discover anomalous behaviour, and uncover hidden behavioural patterns. In addition to
these, a probability analyzer is proposed to serve as a classifier that outputs three categories: normal, suspicious
and abnormal. Hayashi et al. [18] proposed a framework named “Context-Aware Scalable Authentication” (CASA)
to make a trade-off between security and usability. In addition to multiple factors that contribute to a context, the
authors report that location is the most influential factor on the context. Lee [27], a new continuous authentication
system called “SmarterYou” is introduced to integrate the data from smart phone with wearable sensors. The
proposed system builds on data analytics on these features in both time and frequency domains so to ensure
fine-grained authentication. Flexibility is another important aspect to address in smart access control research
as it can potentially compromise security. To address this challenge, Hulsebosch et al. [21] provide a secure
and flexible access control scheme which builds on context sensitiveness and historical data analysis in the
authorization of anonymous users.

While techniques to recognize behavioral patterns have improved, behavioral authentication still cannot
guarantee the complete elimination of false positives [2]. In addition, even if false positives can be solved for

Access control models such as Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Discretionary Access Control (DAC), Role-
Based Access Control (RBAC), and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) have been investigated by the
researchers in this domain [11]. MAC offers operating system-constrained access control to manage process/thread
operating files, network ports, memories, and devices. MAC is widely deployed on Linux, Windows, and databases.
Rossi et al. [37] propose a framework that allows developers to establish fine-grained ad-hoc MAC strategies
for applications, protecting the system from misbehavior (caused by bugs or compromised by attackers) of root
privileged apps. Even though MAC provides high-level protection, it requires users to request permission for
every resource. When compared to MAC, DAC is more flexible by allowing users to grant access to other users.
Khan et al. [25] apply DAC combined with RBAC to access patient files dynamically. RBAC, unlike MAC and
DAC, does not assign access to specific users but to pre-defined roles. By deploying RBAC, IT administration
can operate more efficiently since RBAC can add or switch roles to cope with personnel changes. Cruz et al. [8]
propose RBAC-SC, which utilizes RBAC and smart contracts to implement trans-organizational roles. Unlike
static access control strategies, ABAC dynamically determines permissions according to a set of attributes such
as user, resource, object, environment attributes. ABAC can achieve various levels of access control according to
different requirements and environments in spite of its overhead. Ding et al. [10] propose combining ABAC and
blockchain to cope with the massive connectivity of IoT so to avoid heavy role-engineering for various devices.
As listed in Table 1, compared to the conventional access control schemes, this paper focuses on implicit access
control, which can identify the user-object association by mining historical data, and recognize risky actions
according to the current context.

Besides the studies that aim to bridge access control with implicit authentication, identifying and assessing
the risks of certain contexts is of paramount importance as well. With this in mind, the authors in [19] define
a risk assessment scheme that associates the risk to the location. Cha et al. [7] introduce a data-driven risk

assessment scheme that uses Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to model the flows of individual data and to recognize
the components employed to process, store, and transmit data. Organizations can identify the potential/implicit
incidences according to the associated components. Compared with asset-oriented and process-oriented ap-
proaches, the proposed approach can enhance the risk assessment accuracy by avoiding underestimating or
neglecting the risks to sensitive individual data. In [23], Khambhammettu et al. propose a framework containing
four threat assessment methods for subject-object accesses. Via assigning different weights to the sensitivity score
of data/objects and the trustworthiness score of subjects, the proposed framework is flexible enough to satisfy the
various preference of organizations. Wang et al. [40] present a new access control model that quantifies the risk
of privacy violation in a statistical approach and further detects the physicians/users who over-access or misuse
patients’ private data. Atlam et al. [4] propose a risk estimation model that combines a new fuzzy logic algorithm
and a set of rule-based policies to perform access control in IoT systems. To generate accurate and realistic risk
values for each access request, the proposed fuzzy logic system, which involves twenty experts’ effort, converts
experts’ qualitative expression into numeric values and offers a dynamic and context-aware access control by
leveraging the contextual features such as resource sensitivity, action severity, and risk history.

The literature review indicates a gap remains between continuous/implicit authentication/access control and
risk-awareness, particularly in cyberphysical environments where actions do not only appear in cyberspace but
also stem from physical behaviors, interactions and roles.

In our framework, actions are transformed into events which include contextual information that can be
recognized through coupling mechanisms. Coupling defines interaction patterns between the objects, which can
be recognized through clustering algorithms, that use couplings as the input features. Each coupling feature
is associated to a risk level. Upon obtaining the clusters, an aggregate value of the associated risk levels of the
features of all data points (i.e. actions) in a cluster is calculated as the risk value of that cluster, (i.e. label of
cluster). Note that couplings can be formulated based on time, frequency or a combination of time and frequency.

collections/sets. 𝐶 and 𝑅 indicate coupling and risk respectively and can be denoted in terms of Frequency (𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞)
and/or Duration (𝐷𝑢𝑟 ). 𝐹 𝑨,𝑩

3.1 System Overview

The overview of the proposed RASA scheme is presented in Fig. 1. The use case in this study involves an emergency
room of a healthcare organization where sensors record activities of people (i.e., patients and physicians) and
devices, such as entering or exiting some locations and reading documents/records (as examples in Table 2).
In order to protect patient privacy and physical security, protection systems should raise alarms or introduce
access control levels against hazardous actions, such as a read access to a document by an unfamiliar patient or
entering into unfamiliar rooms. The proposed scheme aims to quantify the risk of given actions and find potential
threats without prior knowledge (e.g., document ownership, patient wards). Nevertheless, if only the action were
considered, not only the context information would be overlooked but similar actions would be repeated, which
might have led to many false alarms. Therefore, in the proposed framework, the first step is to reproduce the
events where actions are performed. Then, these events are used for calculating the couplings which are then
clustered and at the same time assigned some risk levels. The risk levels of couplings determine the risk level of a
cluster of couplings. Finally, the risk levels of clusters are verified against a pre-defined policy.

An argument for using couplings as features described is as follows. Since the risk level is not only determined
by actions but also their context, the actions are initially transformed into events to obtain the surrounding
information, e.g. location, and co-presence. The coupling concept (see Section 3.3 for more details) is introduced
to infer the relationship of objects in action logs. Coupling values are extracted from events and normalized.
These values are stored in coupling matrices to explore their distributions and are marked with high, medium, and
low-risk levels according to their mean value and standard deviation. Coupling features are fed into clustering
algorithms. In this paper, three different coupling features are used: frequency-based features, duration-based
features, and a combination of them. A simple scenario that would trigger the RASA framework to compute
coupling values is illustrated in Fig. 4. One physical action of entering a room and one cyber action of accessing a
document on a device is given as an example.

After the computation of couplings, their risk levels, and forming clusters of couplings, the risk of each cluster
is calculated based on the number of high, medium and low labels of couplings in that cluster. Then, the cluster is

labeled according to cluster risk value. Furthermore, the risk of the entire action log can be determined by the
same calculation to provide the general risk information to the security experts to raise alarm.

In a privacy-sensitive environment such as a clinical setting, the inferred risk context can be utilized to define
a rule-based access control policy managing access and defining risk-based system actions based on calculated
risk. Given a risk level of a cluster of actions or events, a policy can be defined wherein access decisions are made
per read attempt by calculating the overall risk within the current context. RASA estimates overall risk from
the weighted sum of all per-feature risk values. Rather than assigning equal weights to the features, the policy
author may adjust the weights of these coupling features based on direct inputs from subject matter experts. For
instance, when patient documents are the assets considered, the couplings related to documents may be assigned
greater weight factors compared to other couplings that do not consider documents. Furthermore, the policy
may permit or deny read actions by tuning a threshold value for the risk factor. Although such policy definitions
require a threshold to be tuned, the decisions are over clusters rather than individual actions, which is more
scalable, stable, and explainable for policy analysts and users alike. In the conclusion part, we elaborate on AI
outcomes versus policy decisions in order to analyze the efficiency of the AI results.

In the following sections, we explain the components of RASA in detail.

3.2 Action logs

In RASA’s model, action logs consists on data of physical activity such as entering or exiting a room as well
as cyber activity such as logging in a device or accessing a document. In a multi-user distributed system, the
access control of documents is effective to all kinds of actions. Regardless of the devices used in a environment,
wired or mobile, the access of a document can always be abstracted in association with user movements such as
entering or exiting a room, device usage, and operating documents. Our simulated action logs are inspired by
typical actors in clinical, in-person setttings.

device first requests grant for access, and this attempt is also logged. The distribution of the simulated actions are
visualized in Fig. 3 by using T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

As a widely used and effective statistical visualization technique, mapping high dimensional data onto 2D or
3D, t-SNE calculates the probability distributions of each pair of data samples in high and low dimensional spaces,
assigning high probabilities to similar ones and minimizes two distributions Kullback–Leibler divergence. t-SNE
can exhibit the data distribution lying in various manifolds and clusters, while the distance between two samples
in low dimensional space do not represent the distance in high dimensional space but the probabilities [29].
Hence, the axes in the plot do not represent physical units. By visualizing the dataset with t-SNE, we aim to
understand the dataset distribution, discover potential clusters, and analyze the complexity of the problems.

General characteristic of the actions can be formulated as moving these objects (i.e. people, documents and
devices) across different locations over time. Thus, an event or a state machine is defined as a combination of
time, location and a set of objects in this space.

3.3 Feature Extraction and Risk Inference

The coupling concept aims to reveal the interactions among different factors of action logs. As illustrated in Fig. 4,
coupling can be defined between people and location, location and device as well as location and document.
In the figure, the interaction between two factors: document and people is presented in terms of duration and
frequency. Duration denotes how long two objects spend time with each other; frequency denotes how many
times two elements encounter each other. Using the logs, RASA first constructs the frequency and duration
matrices for each object pair (i.e. person-person, person-device, device-location, person-location). The coupling
values in the matrices are normalized to enable comparability between different coupling values.

The coupling factors are denoted as: 𝑷𝒑𝒍 = {𝑝1, 𝑝2, 𝑝3, ..., 𝑝𝑛 }, 𝑫𝒐𝒄 = {𝑑𝑜𝑐1, 𝑑𝑜𝑐2, 𝑑𝑜𝑐3, ..., 𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑛 }, 𝑫𝒆𝒗 =
{𝑑𝑒𝑣1, 𝑑𝑒𝑣2, 𝑑𝑒𝑣3, ..., 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑛 }, 𝑳𝒐𝒄 = {𝑙𝑜𝑐1, 𝑙𝑜𝑐2, 𝑙𝑜𝑐3, ..., 𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑁 }. The computation of coupling values is given in Eq.1
and Eq.2 for frequency and duration, respectively.

In the RASA framework, the first step is converting the action logs to events. Algorithm 1 presents the
generation of event list dictionary which stores the status transitions of all factors. As discussed in Section 3.2, an
action log contains a factor (e.g., a person, document, or device), an action (e.g., enter, read, or exit), and a location.
For each action log, the algorithm determines the previous event, creates a new event according to whether the
action is to move the factor in or out, and finally updates the statuses of all elements of the new event. It is worth
to note that factors do not include locations as opposed to the element of an event. The event list dictionary is
further processed by Algorithm 2 to generate 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑎𝑖,𝑏 𝑗 which counts the number of times that 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏 𝑗 coexist
in the same event and 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑖,𝑏 𝑗 which records the duration that two elements occur in the same event.

If 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑎𝑖,𝑏 𝑗 and 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑖,𝑏 𝑗 are considered, they can be abstracted as 𝐺𝑎𝑖,𝑏 𝑗 . Then, Eq.3 represents a coupling
matrix (not yet normalized). The time window of the distribution is determined by the tuple (𝑘𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 , 𝑘𝑒𝑛𝑑 ). 𝑇𝐸𝑘
indicates the duration of each event. Note that 𝑨 and 𝑩 should satisfy 𝑉 𝑎𝑟 (𝑨) > 𝑉 𝑎𝑟 (𝑩). The rationale behind
this condition is as follows: according to Eq. 1 and Eq.2, these two formulas asymmetrically normalize the values.
That said, in order to make coupling values comparable, the differences between the elements which have larger
variance need to be reduced.

In case an object, such as a physician, interacts/couples with other objects or locations equally, its couplings
will tend towards 1. If two objects less frequently interact, their coupling tends towards 0, which means the risk
associated to their coexistence is high.

Our final goal is to label each cluster of couplings with a risk level, which will be described in the next section.
To be able to associate clusters with the risk, we need to first assign risk levels to each individual coupling.
Therefore, for each coupling matrix, we map the coupling values to onto three risk levels as high, medium or low
risk. To achieve this, we set a threshold as Eq. 6 and apply mean value binning over the coupling values.

𝑇ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐻𝑖𝑔ℎ = 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 − 𝛼 ∗ 𝑠𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑣

(6)

To formulate the risk level of each event, several strategies are applied, one of which is to code high as three,
medium as two and low as one. This is followed by calculating the average risk of each event. Then the average
risk will be marked as high, medium, low-risk. The other one is to directly code the risk level of each feature,

which can directly represent features’ pattern. The latter one is used to evaluate the results. Even if the risk
level of each coupling value is inferred, still, it can not be used as ground truth because we introduce human
subjectivity and intuition into this inference.

Conventionally, researchers may adopt a risk matrix [15] to evaluate the risk level, e.g. 𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘 ∝ 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 ∗
𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡. However, this study infers risk by defining association between various objects and situations in the
action logs. Thus, the use of conventional risk formulation is left to future work along with further investigations
on the quantification of the impact.

3.4 Clustering of Couplings and Labeling of the Clusters

RASA framework clusters the couplings into groups and uses the cluster members’ risk levels to determine the
label of each cluster. Note that non-clustered couplings are less frequently observed, and so possess higher risk.
Most clustering algorithms put similar distance samples into one cluster. In this work, risk levels of couplings

are used as the distance metric in cluster formation.

The cluster risk value (CRV) is determined based on the following formula:

𝐶𝑅𝑉 =

𝑁𝐻 ∗ 𝐶𝐻 + 𝑁𝑀 ∗ 𝐶𝑀 + 𝑁𝐿 ∗ 𝐶𝐿
𝑁𝐻 + 𝑁𝑀 + 𝑁𝐿

(7)

where 𝑁𝐻 , 𝑁𝑀 , 𝑁𝐿 denote the number of high, medium and low-risk features, respectively; and 𝐶𝐻 , 𝐶𝑀 , 𝐶𝐿 are
the codes that are assigned to high, medium and low-risk levels. 𝐶𝐻 , 𝐶𝑀 , 𝐶𝐿 corresponds to 3, 2, 1, respectively, 3
denoting a higher risk. This is followed by mapping these values to Low (L), Low-Medium (LM), Medium-Low

(ML), Medium (M), Medium-High (MH), High-Medium (HM), and High (H) risk levels according to Table 4. In
case a cluster is labeled high-risk, all actions in this cluster would be denied. Otherwise, the clusters with medium
or low-risk labels contain the actions that may be permitted. The decision for medium risk clusters depends on
the coupling feature-based risk levels for each individual point.

4 NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section we evaluate the initial promise of the RASA approach by comparing the decisions against an
heuristic policy, and also validated with two supervised learning methods, namely decision tree and Support
Vector Machine (SVM).

The action logs used in this work contain one device; hence the available features are Location-People,
Location-Device, Location-Document, and Document-People. Because the action logs cover a single device,
only 𝐶𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡,𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛, 𝐶𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒,𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛, 𝐶𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒,𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒 , and 𝐶𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒,𝑑𝑜𝑐𝑢𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 are used in the evaluations. We present

the results under using duration-based features, frequency-based features and the combined (i.e. frequency
and duration-based) features. In addition, three different clustering algorithms are applied, which are Gaussian
mixture models (GMM) [36], Agglomerative Hierarchical [43], and DBSCAN [13]. The target is to cluster these
features (couplings) and label the clusters with risk levels. The aim of the clustering algorithm is to form the least
possible number of clusters where within each cluster co-existence of high and low risk patterns is avoided.

4.1 Numerical Results of Clustering and Labeling

This subsection presents visualization of features followed by feature-by-feature risk of each cluster in the action
logs. Then, results under different clustering algorithms are discussed, and finally cluster risk levels are presented

that hierarchical and GMM clustering schemes generate the same results, as shown in Fig. 9. It is not viable to
apply the frequency or duration as the only metric to evaluate objects’ relationship and their risk levels. In this
study, we also consider the circumstances under which people may stay in a room for a long time while they enter
and exit other rooms with high frequency. Therefore,the frequency-based features are also expected to affect
the risk assessment. Since the duration-based coupling features and frequency-based features show distinctive

perspective of the action logs, this study also employs the combined features defined as concatenation of two
features. Clustering results, and risk value results are generated by using three different features. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9
present the percentage of feature-by-feature risk levels of clusters by using frequency-based, duration-based,
and combined features. When Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 are compared when given the same number of clusters, DBSCAN,
Hierarchical and HMM provide similar results, although DBSCAN results suggest it may increased noise.

Both Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 illustrate the diversity of three features; however the results of these three features have
similar pattern. Low-risk events are dominant, other types of risk are minor, which is what one would hope is a
realistic distribution of event risks in normal clinical practice. This pattern also results in the similarity of the
three figures in Fig. 10. It is worth to note that the occurrence of this pattern is only due to the simulated action
logs used in this study. When different action logs are employed, the result of three features may lead to a more
significant variation.

4.1.3 Clustering algorithms: (HMM and DBSCAN). The strength of DBSCAN is that we do not need to specify
the number of clusters upfront while in hierarchical and GMM number of desired clusters are given. If there
were more factors in the action logs, the number of features would increase, hence labeling of action clusters by
using DBSCAN is generalizable. Indeed, outliers are expected, however, the outliers are not treated as high-risk

18

samples directly, because the events maybe the sub-events of another cluster. For instance, in Tables 5,6 and
7, the sample in the cluster -1, does not have documents in this event; hence there is no possibility of leaking
sensitive data in such an event. Nevertheless, in practice we expect that, as a matter of policy, outliers would be
escalated to the security operations and policy experts.

4.1.4 Cluster Risk Levels. As clusters and their feature-by-feature risk levels are obtained, risk values of clusters
are calculated according to Eq. 7 and binned into 7 groups: Low, Low-medium, medium-low, medium, medium-
high, high-medium, and high. Since the actions in medium and low-risk level clusters will be permitted, we
intend to prevent high average-risk (defined in Section 3.4) samples occur in medium and low-risk level clusters.
Although the average-risk level is not a kind of ground truth, if it shows high-risk, then most of the features
of the sample raise alert or medium-risk. As explained in the feature extraction section, the coupling value of
medium-risk is similar to that of high-risk. There is no obvious boundary between these two risk levels, and
clustering algorithms provide some potential risk patterns in the action logs.

The risk values and levels of each cluster are shown on in Tables 5, 6, and 7. The cluster risk values are sorted
and plotted as illustrated in Fig. 10. This paper further compares the outcomes of three features in Fig. 11. Most
of them are safe clusters whereas only one cluster raises a high-risk alert. Based on this, the risk value of the
entire dataset (i.e. action log) can be calculated as well, which is 1.28 in this case.

As shown in Fig. 14, when the model is trained with dataset 1, and tested with dataset 2, 100% training accuracy
and 99.86% test accuracy are achieved. As Fig. 3 and Fig. 12 present, despite the distinct distributions of dataset 1
and 2, the proposed methodology can still function well.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is also employed and it achieves 99.95% test accuracy.

4.3 Access Control Policy-based Decisions

The performance of RASA framework is validated against a policy-based access control scheme. Policy-based
decisions can be considered as a Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) [20] approach, utilizing the four
frequency-based coupling features introduced above in addition to the traffic, which indicates the number of
people in the current event, and co-existence, which is triple-coupling, people-document-location coupling.
Eventhough the traffic does not entail any coupling, it is possible to use Eq. 6, and the average value to determine
the risk level of each coupling value.

Other features would further transform into risk as well. The policy maps the features’ risk onto three risk
categories: Device Risk, Environment Risk, and Action Risk. Furthermore it applies a weighted sum of these risks
together to determine the overall risk.

Due to the lack of labels or other methods to prove the efficiency of these methods, to examine the performance of
the proposed scheme, the unsupervised method and policy-based method are also compared with each other[26].
By tuning the parameters of policy, we also investigated the outcomes of RASA and policy and analyzed the
action log. As shown in the Table. 8, Table. 9, and Table. 10, the frequency-based, duration-based, and combined
coupling features show 99.32%, 99.27%, and 99.32% overall consistency, respectively. Since the policy uses the
triple factor coupling, it is more likely to detect the rare cases but meanwhile, it is the only triple factor coupling
since only one device exists in the action log. When the number of coupling factors increases, the types of
couplings will reduce, and such a situation would occur where the frequency or duration is not enough to make
statistical decision because the frequency or duration disperse on more coupling combinations.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we propose the Risk-Aware Smart Access Control (RASA) framework, which defines a simple overall
structure to learn use contexts from observed resource access within cyberphysical contexts, and use simple
parameters to define a context-dependent and risk-based authorization scheme based on those contexts. The
basic framework can be utilized to extend other access control regimes that lack sufficient support for security
policy analysts to craft and maintain context-dependent authorization policies. RASA utilizes combined cyber and
physical activity logs, converts action sequence to events which contain contextual information, and identifies
common relations through a coupling approach based on duration and frequency of interactions.

Risk-Aware Fine-Grained Access Control in Cyber-Physical Contexts

Every coupling is assigned a risk value which results from the intuition that frequently occurring interactions
can be considered as low-risk and rarely occurring actions as high-risk. RASA further feeds these couplings to
clustering algorithms, after which the level of risk for a cluster is determined based on the risk levels of cluster
members (i.e. couplings). Thereafter RASA denies actions in high-risk clusters and permits safe actions. One of
the insights from our study in a simulated clinical environment is the importance of the selection of couplings on
risk inference.

Three different features are explored in this study, namely, frequency-based, duration-based and the combination
of frequency and duration. According to clustering and labelling results, these features can exhibit distinct
perspectives of risk. We show that combined features can more comprehensively represent the risk of events and
actions.

It may be helpful in future work to define other risk factor compositions and understand better their interactions.
RASA is purposefully designed to require little in the way of security policy analyst input–for example, no
extensive labeling of actions into risk is required to develop a training set. Our evaluation established a basic
validation of the promise of building on this approach.

In the tuning process, rule-based policy results are compared with the outcomes of RASA, and rule-based policy
and RASA are updated in each iteration. After multiple tuning iterations, the decisions of two approaches achieved
> 99% consistency. Furthermore, to validate the results of RASA, when two supervised methods (Decision tree
and SVM) are trained and tested by using different action logs labeled by RASA, 99.95% test accuracy is achieved.
Future work could seek evaluation against data derived from authentic use cases. Similar approaches to
automatic inference of authorization contexts and associated risks may be particularly applicable in rich cyber-
physical environments where sensors are deployed to generate activity logs by monitoring physical actions,
in addition to common network and endpoint cyber action logs. Such sensor-rich environments are becoming
increasingly common in extremely diverse cyberphysical contexts, including clinical, industrial, home, auto-
motive, smart-building, and smart-city contexts. As these cyberphysical systems grow in size and complexity,
human-written context-dependent authorization access rules will not scale, nor will expert risk analysis be cost
effective and reliable without evidence-based risk assessment of such accesses. The RASA framework proposed
in this paper may be a stepping stone to rich exploration of similar approaches to address such growing problems
in cyberphysical security.

APPENDIX

In this section, we present further detailed results about coupling matrices and normalized coupling matrices for
each pair of coupled factors.

By following Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, the action logs are transformed into events, and the frequency
and duration information are extracted. As shown in Table 11 and Table 12, we present 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑎𝑖,𝑏 𝑗 and 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑖,𝑏 𝑗
in 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞𝐴,𝐵 and 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝐴,𝐵 coupling matrices, respectively. By applying Eq. 1 and Eq. 2, the coupling matrices are
transformed into normalized coupling matrices listed in Table 13 and Table 14. Since one device exists in the
dataset, four couplings are selected as features (i.e., 𝐶𝐷𝑜𝑐,𝐿𝑜𝑐 , 𝐶𝑃𝑝𝑙,𝐷𝑜𝑐 , 𝐶𝑃𝑝𝑙,𝐿𝑜𝑐 and 𝐶𝑃𝑝𝑙,𝑃𝑝𝑙 ). By viewing both
the frequency-based and duration-based coupling matrices, one can have a clear understanding of how factors
interact with each other.
