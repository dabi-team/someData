FENCE: Feasible Evasion Attacks on Neural Networks in
Constrained Environments

As advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) demonstrate unprecedented levels of performance in many
critical applications, their vulnerability to attacks is still an open question. We consider evasion attacks at
testing time against Deep Learning in constrained environments, in which dependencies between features
need to be satisfied. These situations may arise naturally in tabular data or may be the result of feature
engineering in specific application domains, such as threat detection in cyber security. We propose a general
iterative gradient-based framework called FENCE for crafting evasion attacks that take into consideration
the specifics of constrained domains and application requirements. We apply it against Feed-Forward Neural
Networks trained for two cyber security applications: network traffic botnet classification and malicious
domain classification, to generate feasible adversarial examples. We extensively evaluate the success rate
and performance of our attacks, compare their improvement over several baselines, and analyze factors that
impact the attack success rate, including the optimization objective and the data imbalance. We show that
with minimal effort (e.g., generating 12 additional network connections), an attacker can change the model’s
prediction from the Malicious class to Benign and evade the classifier. We show that models trained on datasets
with higher imbalance are more vulnerable to our FENCE attacks. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of
performing adversarial training in constrained domains to increase the model resilience against these evasion
attacks.

1 INTRODUCTION
Deep learning has reached high performance in machine learning (ML) tasks in a variety of
application domains, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language
processing (NLP). Many applications already benefit from the deployment of ML for automating
decisions and we expect a proliferation of ML in even more critical settings in the near future. Still,
research in adversarial machine learning showed that deep neural networks (DNNs) are not robust in
face of adversarial attacks. The first adversarial attack against DNNs was an evasion attack, in which
an adversary creates adversarial examples that minimally perturb testing samples and change the
classifier’s prediction [68]. Since the discovery of adversarial examples in computer vision, a lot of
work on evasion attacks against ML classifiers at deployment time has been performed. Most of these
attacks have been demonstrated in continuous domains (i.e., image classification), in which features
or image pixels can be modified arbitrarily to create the perturbations [6, 8, 11, 27, 39, 46, 53, 68].
ML has a lot of potential in other application domains, including cyber security, finance, and
healthcare, in which the raw data is not directly suitable for learning and engineered features are

defined by domain experts to train DNN models. Additionally, in certain application domains such
as network traffic classification used in cyber security, the raw data itself might exhibit domain-
specific constraints in the original input space. Therefore, techniques used for mounting evasion
attacks in continuous domains will not respect the feature-space dependencies in these applications
and new adversarial attacks need to be designed for such constrained domains.

In this paper we introduce a novel, general framework for mounting evasion attacks against deep
learning models in constrained application domains. Our framework is named FENCE (Feasible
Evasion Attacks on Neural Networks in Constrained Environments). FENCE generates feasible
adversarial examples in constrained domains that rely either on feature engineering or naturally
have domain-specific dependencies in the input space. FENCE supports a range of linear and
non-linear dependencies in feature space and can be applied to any higher-level classification
task whose data respects these constraints. At the core of FENCE is an iterative optimization
method that determines the feature of the maximum gradient of the attacker’s objective at each
iteration, identifies the family of features dependent on that feature, and modifies consistently
all those features, while preserving an upper bound on the maximum distance from the original
sample. At any time during the iterative procedure, the input data point is modified within the
feasibility region, resulting in feasible adversarial examples. Existing evasion attacks in constrained
environments, such as PDF malware detection [65, 69], malware classification [30, 66], and network
traffic classification [1, 2, 28, 31, 59] do not support the entire range of complex mathematical and
domain-specific dependencies as our FENCE framework. Moreover, some of these attacks result in
worse performance [2] or operate only in a specific domain [59] or feature space [2, 28].

We demonstrate that FENCE can successfully evade the DNNs trained for two cyber security
applications: a malicious network traffic classifier using the CTU-13 botnet dataset [25], and a
malicious domain classifier using the MADE system [50]. In both settings, FENCE generates feasible
adversarial examples with small modification of the original testing sample. For instance, by adding
12 network connections and preserving the original malicious behavior, an attacker can change
the classification prediction of a testing sample from Malicious to Benign in the network traffic
classifier. We perform detailed evaluation to demonstrate that our attacks perform better than
several baselines and existing attacks. We show that the state-of-the-art Carlini-Wagner attack [11]
designed for continuous domains does not respect the feature-space dependencies of our security
applications. We compare two optimization objectives in our FENCE framework, the Projected
Gradient Descent (PGD) [46] and the Penalty method [11], and show the advantages of the PGD
optimization. We also study the impact of data imbalance on the classifier robustness and show
that models trained on datasets with higher imbalance, as is common in security applications, are
more vulnerable.

We also consider attack models with minimum knowledge about the ML system, in which the
attacker does not have information about the exact model architecture and hyperparameters. We
test several approaches for performing the attacks through transferability from a surrogate model
to the original one, using the FENCE framework. We observe that the evasion attacks generated
for different DNN architectures transfer to the target DNN model with slightly lower success than
attacking directly the target model with FENCE. Finally, we test the resilience of adversarial training
using our attacks as a defensive mechanism for DNNs trained in constrained environments.

To summarize, our contributions are:

(1) We introduce a general evasion attack framework FENCE for constrained application domains
that supports a range of mathematical dependencies in feature space and two optimization
approaches.

impact of data imbalance on the classifiers’ robustness.

and architectures, and show that adversarially-trained models provide higher robustness.

2 BACKGROUND

2.1 Deep Neural Networks for Classification
A feed-forward neural network (FFNN) for binary classification is a function 𝑦 = 𝐹 (𝑥) from input
𝑥 ∈ 𝑅𝑑 (of dimension 𝑑) to output 𝑦 ∈ {0, 1}. The parameter vector of the function is learned
during the training phase using back propagation over the network layers. Each layer includes a
matrix multiplication and non-linear activation (e.g., ReLU). The last layer’s activation is sigmoid
𝜎 for binary classification: 𝑦 = 𝐹 (𝑥) = 𝜎 (𝑍 (𝑥)), where 𝑍 (𝑥) are the logits, i.e., the output of the
penultimate layer. We denote by 𝐶 (𝑥) the predicted class for 𝑥. For multi-class classification, the
last layer uses a softmax activation function. There are other DNN architectures for classification,
such as convolutional neural networks, but in this paper we only consider FFNN architectures.

2.2 Threat Model
Adversarial attacks against ML algorithms can be developed in the training or testing phase. In this
work, we consider testing-time attacks, called evasion attacks. There exist several evasion attacks
against DNNs in continuous domains: the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack [46] and the
penalty-based attack of Carlini and Wagner [11].

Projected gradient attacks. This is a class of attacks based on gradient descent for objective
minimization, that project the adversarial points to the feasible domain at each iteration. For
instance, Biggio et al. [8] use an objective that maximizes the confidence of adversarial examples,
within a ball of fixed radius in 𝐿1 norm. Madry et al. [46] use the loss function directly as the
optimization objective and use the 𝐿2 and 𝐿∞ distances for projection.

C&W attack. Carlini and Wagner [11] solve the following optimization problem to create adver-
sarial examples against CNNs used for multi-class prediction:

𝛿 = arg min ||𝛿 ||2 + 𝑐 · ℎ(𝑥 + 𝛿)
ℎ(𝑥 + 𝛿) = max(0, max(𝑍𝑘 (𝑥 + 𝛿) : 𝑘 ≠ 𝑡) − 𝑍𝑡 (𝑥 + 𝛿)),
where 𝑍 () are the logits of the FFNN.
This is called the penalty method, and the optimization objective has two terms: the norm of the
perturbation 𝛿, and a function ℎ(𝑥 + 𝛿) that is minimized when the adversarial example 𝑥 + 𝛿 is
classified as the target class 𝑡. The attack works for 𝐿0, 𝐿2, and 𝐿∞ norms.

Under the assumption that the DNN model is trained correctly, the attacker’s goal is to create
adversarial examples at testing time. In security settings, typically the attacker starts with Malicious
points that he aims to minimally modify into adversarial examples classified as Benign.

Initially, we consider a white-box attack model, in which the attacker has full knowledge of the ML
system. White-box attacks have been considered extensively in previous work, e.g., [8, 11, 27, 46]
to evaluate the robustness of existing ML classification algorithms. We also consider a more
realistic attack model, in which the attacker has information about the feature representation of
the underlying classifier, but no exact details on the ML algorithm and training data.

We address application domains with various constraints in feature space. These could manifest
directly in the raw data features or could be an artifact of the feature engineering process. The
attacker has the ability to insert records in the raw data, for instance by inserting network connec-
tions in the threat detection applications. We ensure that the data points modified or added by the
attacker are feasible in the constrained domain.

3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we start by describing the classification setting in constrained domains with
dependencies in feature space and the challenges of evasion attacks in this setting. Then we
devote the majority of the section to present our new attack framework FENCE which takes into
consideration the relationships between features that occur naturally in the problem space or are
the result of feature engineering.

3.1 Machine Learning Classification in Constrained Domains
Let the raw data input space be denoted as R. This is the original space in which raw data is
collected for an application. In healthcare, R could be the space of all data collected for a particular
patient. In network security, R could be the raw network traffic (for example, pcap files or Zeek
network logs) collected in a monitored network in order to detect cyber attacks.

Consider a fixed raw data set 𝑅 = {𝑟1, . . . , 𝑟𝑀 } ∈ R. The raw data is typically processed into
a feature representation, denoted by F , over which the machine learning model is trained. In
standard computer vision tasks such as image classification, the raw data (image pixels) is used
directly as input for neural networks. Thus, the training examples 𝑥𝑖 are the same as the raw data:
𝑥𝑖 = 𝑟𝑖, 𝑖 ∈ [1, 𝑀]. In this case the feature space F is the same as the input space R.

In contrast, in other domains, such as threat detection or health care, the feature representation
is not always exactly the raw data. See Figure 1 for a visual representation of this process. In most
application domains, there might exist dependencies and constraints in the feature space introduced
either by the application itself or by the feature engineering process:

• Dependencies among different features could manifest naturally in the considered application.
For instance, the results of two blood tests are correlated and they result in correlated
feature values for a patient data. In network security, the packet size and number of packets
are correlated with the total number of bytes sent in a TCP connection. We denote by

ACM Trans. Priv. Sec., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: June 2022.

Feasible_Set(𝑅) the set of all feasible points in the raw data space. Feasible_Set(𝑅) is a
subset of the raw data that encompasses the feasible values for the particular application. For
instance, a network TCP packet size is upper bounded by 1500 bytes and the ratio between
the number of bytes and the number of packets in a TCP connection needs to be lower
than the maximum packet size. The feasible set Feasible_Set(𝑅) will only include network
connections in which the upper bound on TCP packets is enforced and the ratio constraint
between the number of bytes and number of packets is satisfied.

• Constraints in feature representations might also result from the feature engineering process
performed in many settings. In this case, features in F are obtained by the application of
an operator Op𝑗 on the raw data 𝑅 ∈ R: 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 = Op𝑗 (𝑅). Examples of operators are statistical
functions such as Max, Min, Avg, and Total, as well as linear combinations of raw data
values, and other mathematical functions such as product or ratio of two values. The set
of all supported operators applied to the raw data is denoted by O. This process creates 𝑁
training examples 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑁 in the feature space F , each being 𝑑-dimensional, with 𝑑 the
size of the feature space. The feature engineering process creates additional dependencies
in feature space. For instance, if we consider the Max, Min, and Avg number of connections
for a particular port in a given time window, the average value needs to be between the
minimum and the maximum values.

A data point 𝑧 = (𝑧1, . . . , 𝑧𝑑 ) in feature space F is feasible if there exists some raw data 𝑅 ∈ R
such as for all 𝑖, there exists an operator Op𝑗 ∈ O with 𝑧𝑖 = Op𝑗 (𝑅). The set of all feasible points
in feature space for raw data 𝑅 and operators O is called Feasible_Set(𝑅, O). This space includes
the set of feasible points Feasible_Set(𝑅) (obtained for O = ∅). Examples of feasible and infeasible
points in feature space are illustrated in Table 1. The constraints in this example are that the sum
of feature values must sum up to one. This may arise in situations when the subset of features
represents ratio values, for example, the ratio of connections that have a particular result code.

3.2 Challenges
Existing evasion attacks are mostly designed for continuous domains, such as image classification,
where adversarial examples have pixel values in a fixed range (e.g., [0,1]) and can be modified
independently [6, 11, 46]. However, many applications in cyber security use tabular data, resulting
in feature dependencies and physical-world constraints that need to be respected.

Several previous works address evasion attacks in domains with tabular data. The evasion attack
for malware detection by Grosse et al. [29], which directly leverages JSMA [53], modifies binary
features corresponding to system calls. Kolosnjaji et al. [36] use the attack of Biggio et al. [8]
to append selected bytes at the end of the malware file. Suciu et al. [66] also append bytes in
selected regions of malicious files. Kulynych et al. [38] introduce a graphical framework in which
an adversary constructs all feasible transformations of an input, and then uses graph search to
determine the path of the minimum cost to generate an adversarial example.

Neither of these approaches is applicable to our general setting because the attacks do not satisfy
the required dependencies in the resulting adversarial vector. Crafting adversarial examples that
are feasible, and respecting all the application constraints and dependencies poses a significant
challenge. Once application constraints are specified, the resulting optimization problem for creating
adversarial examples includes a number of non-linear constraints and cannot be solved directly
using out-of-the-box optimization methods.

In order to measure the feasibility of adversarial examples, we run the existing Carlini and
Wagner (C&W) attack [11] on a malicious domain classification. The details of the attack adaptation
for this application are given in Section 4.2. We considered the balanced case, in which the number
of Malicious and Benign examples is equal in training. While the attack reaches 98% success at a
distance of 20, the resulting adversarial examples are outside the feasibility region. An example is
included in Table 2, and the description of the features is given in Table 6. In this case, the average
number of connections is not equal to the total number of connections divided by the number of
IPs contacting the domain. Additionally, the average ratio of received bytes over sent bytes should
be equal to the maximum and minimum values (as the number of IPs contacting the domain is 1).

Table 2. Infeasible C&W adversarial example for the malicious domain classifier. The inconsistent feature
values are in red, while the correct values are in green. We consider all the IPs that connect to the domain and
all the connections made to the domain. The ratio of bytes features are computed as ratio of received bytes
over sent bytes per IP. When there is a single IP connecting to the domain, the number of connections should
be equal to the average number of connections by IP, and the three ratio bytes features should all be equal.

3.3 The FENCE framework
To address these issues, we introduce the FENCE framework for evasion attacks that preserves
a range of feature dependencies in constrained domains. FENCE guarantees by design that the
produced adversarial examples are within the feasible region of the application input space.

The starting point for the attack framework are gradient-based optimization algorithms, including
projected [8, 46] and penalty-based [11] optimization methods. Of course, we cannot apply these
attacks directly since they will not preserve the feature dependencies. To overcome this, we use the
values of the objective gradient at each iteration to select features of maximum gradient values.
We create feature-update algorithms for each family of dependencies that use a combination of
gradient-based method and mathematical constraints to always maintain a feasible point that
satisfies the constraints. We also use various projection operators to project the updated adversarial
examples to feasible regions of the feature space.

Algorithms 1, 2 and Figure 2 describe the general FENCE framework. We consider binary
classifiers designed using FFNN architectures. However, the framework can be extended to multi-
class scenarios by modifying the optimization objective. For measuring the amount of perturbation
added by the original example, we use the 𝐿2 norm.

The input to the FENCE framework consists of: an input sample 𝒙 with label 𝑦 (typically Malicious
in security applications); a target label 𝑡 (typically Benign); the model prediction function 𝐶; the
optimization objective 𝐺; maximum allowed perturbation 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 ; the subset of features 𝐹𝑆 that can

of features. A family is defined as a subset of 𝐹𝐷 such that features within the family need to be
updated simultaneously, whereas features outside the family can be updated independently. In our
malicious network traffic classification application, a family of features is defined for each port by
including all features extracted for that particular port. All these features are dependent and they
are modified jointly during the adversarial optimization procedure.

The algorithm proceeds iteratively. The goal is to update the data point in the direction of
the gradient (to minimize the optimization objective) while preserving the domain-specific and
mathematical dependencies between features. In each iteration, the gradients of all modifiable
features are computed, and the feature of the maximum gradient is selected. The update of the data
point 𝑥 in the direction of the gradient is performed as follows:

(1) If the feature of maximum gradient belongs to a family with other dependent features, function
UPDATE_FAMILY is called (Algorithm 1, line 10). Inside the function, the representative
feature for the family is computed (this needs to be defined for each application). In the
malicious network traffic classification example, the representative feature for a port’s family
is the number of sent packets on that port. The representative feature is updated first,
according to its gradient value, followed by updates to other dependent features using the
function UPDATE_DEP (Algorithm 2, line 11). We need to define the function UPDATE_DEP
for each application, but we use a set of building blocks that support common operations
in feature space and are reusable across applications. We refer the reader to Section 3.4 for
a set of dependencies supported by our framework. Once all features in the family have
been updated, there is a possibility that the updated data point exceeds the allowed distance
threshold from the original point. If that is the case, the algorithm backtracks and performs
a binary search for the amount of perturbation added to the representative feature (until it
finds a value for which the modified data point is inside the allowed region).

(2) If the feature of maximum gradient does not belong to any feature family, then it can be
updated independently from other features. The feature is updated using the standard gradient

update rule (Algorithm 1, line 13). This is followed by a projection Π2 within the feasible 𝐿2
ball.

Finally, if the attacker is successful at identifying an adversarial example in feature space, it is
projected back to the raw input space representation (using function PROJECT_TO_RAW). With
the FENCE framework, we guarantee that modifications in feature space always result in feasible
regions of the feature space, meaning that they can be projected back to the raw input space. Of
course, if the raw data representation is used directly as features for the ML classifier, the projection
is not necessary.

FENCE currently supports two optimization objectives:
• Objective for Projected attack. We set the objective 𝐺 (𝑥) = 𝑍1(𝑥), where 𝑍1 is the logit for the

Malicious class, and 𝑍0 = 1 − 𝑍1 for the Benign class:

𝛿 = arg min 𝑍1(𝑥 + 𝛿),
s.t. ||𝛿 ||2 ≤ 𝑑𝑚𝑎𝑥 ,
𝑥 + 𝛿 ∈ Feasible_Set(𝑅, O)
• Objective for Penalty attack. The penalty objective for binary classification is equivalent to:
𝛿 = arg min ||𝛿 ||2 + 𝑐 · max(0, 𝑍1(𝑥 + 𝛿)),
𝑥 + 𝛿 ∈ Feasible_Set(𝑅, O)

Our general FENCE evasion framework can be used for different classifiers, with multiple features
representations and constraints. The components that need to be defined for each application are:
(1) the optimization objective 𝐺 for computing adversarial examples; (2) the families of dependent
features and family representatives; (3) the UPDATE_DEP function that performs feature updates
per family; (4) the projection operation PROJECT_TO_RAW that transforms adversarial examples
from feature space to the raw data input.

3.4 Dependencies in Feature Space
In this section, we describe the dependencies in the feature space that FENCE supports. For each of
these, there is a corresponding UPDATE_DEP algorithm used in the FENCE optimization framework.
Once the representative feature in a family is updated according to the gradient value in Algorithm 1,
the dependent features are updated with the UPDATE_DEP algorithm.

Domain-Specific Dependencies. The supported domain-specific dependencies are illustrated in
Table 3. These dependencies might occur naturally in the raw data space. The Range dependency
ensures that feature values are in a particular numerical range, while the Ratio dependency ensures
that the ratio of two features is in a particular interval. The one-hot encoded feature dependency
is a structural dependency of the input vector representation, encountered when categorical data
is represented by creating a binary feature for each value. Algorithms 3 and 4 describe how to
preserve the Range and Ratio dependencies, respectively.

Algorithm 3 illustrates the procedure for updating dependent features to satisfy the Ratio rela-
tionship. If the dependency between two features 𝑥 and 𝑦 is such that 𝑥/𝑦 ∈ [𝑎, 𝑏], then feature 𝑥 is
modified according to the gradient value, but the final range is restricted to the interval [𝑎 · 𝑦, 𝑏 · 𝑦].
Algorithm 4 gives the update function for Range. It ensures that input 𝑥 is projected to interval
[𝑎, 𝑏]. It returns the projected value of 𝑥, as well as the absolute value of the difference between 𝑥
and its projection.

Mathematical Feature Dependencies. Mathematical dependencies resulting from feature en-
gineering supported by FENCE are illustrated in Table 4. These include statistical dependencies,
linear and non-linear dependencies between multiple features, as well as combinations of these. To

provide some insight, Algorithm 5 and Algorithm 6 illustrate how to preserve 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐿𝑖𝑛 and 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡
dependencies.

Algorithm 5 shows the NonLin update feature dependency procedure. Here, we need to ensure
that the constraint 𝑥𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑗 /𝑥𝑘 = 0 is satisfied for three features 𝑥𝑖, 𝑥 𝑗 , and 𝑥𝑘 . Gradient update is
performed first for 𝑥 𝑗 , after which the value of 𝑥𝑖 is modified to ensure the equality constraint,
while feature 𝑥𝑘 is kept constant.

Algorithm 6 gives the update method for satisfying the Stat dependency. This is done for a family
of features that includes the minimum 𝑥𝑚𝑖𝑛, the average 𝑥𝑎𝑣𝑔, the maximum 𝑥𝑚𝑎𝑥 , and the total
number 𝑥𝑡𝑜𝑡 from some events from the raw data. After the update of feature 𝑥𝑡𝑜𝑡 (by increasing,
for example, the total number of network connections), we need to adjust the average value 𝑥𝑎𝑣𝑔
and the corresponding minimum and maximum values. The input to Update_Stat also includes a
value 𝑣 that is the new value added to the raw data, which could impact the minimum or maximum
values.

but our focus in the paper is on cyber security applications.

4.1 Malicious Network Traffic Classification
Network traffic includes important information about communication patterns between source and
destination IP addresses. Classification methods have been applied to labeled network connections
to determine malicious infections, such as those generated by botnets [7, 10, 34, 50]. Network
data comes in a variety of formats, but the most common include net flows, Zeek logs, and packet
captures.

Dataset. We leverage a public dataset of botnet traffic that was captured at the CTU University in
the Czech Republic, called the CTU-13 dataset [25]. We consider the three scenarios for detecting
the Neris botnet in this dataset. The dataset includes Zeek connection logs with communications
between internal IP addresses (on the campus network) and external ones. The dataset has the
advantage of providing ground truth, i.e., labels of Malicious and Benign IP addresses. The goal of
the classifier is to distinguish Malicious and Benign IP addresses on the internal network.

The fields available in Zeek connection logs are given in Figure 3. They include: the timestamp of
the connection start; the source IP address; the source port; the destination IP address; the destination
port; the number of packets sent and received; the number of bytes sent and received; and the
connection duration (the time difference between when the last packet and first packets are sent).

Fig. 3. Zeek logs (top), raw data representation (left), and feature families per port (right) for network traffic
classifier.

In this application, we can use either the raw connection representation or leverage domain
knowledge to create aggregated features. We describe existing feature relationships and apply our
FENCE framework against both representations.

Raw Data Representation. This consists of the following fields: one-hot encoded port number,
one-hot encoded connection type, duration, original bytes, received bytes, original packets, and received
packets. The feature vector is illustrated in Figure 3 on the left. The raw data representation includes
no mathematical dependencies, but has the following domain-specific constraints:

- The TCP and UDP packet sizes are capped at 1500 bytes. We create range intervals for these

values, resulting in a 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 dependency between the number of packets and their sizes.

- The connection duration is the interval between the last and the first packet. If the connection
is idle for some time interval (e.g., 30 seconds), it is closed by default by Zeek. The attacker can
thus control the duration of the connection by sending packets at certain time intervals to avoid
closing the connection. We generate a range of valid durations from the distribution of connection
duration in the training dataset. This creates again a 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 dependency between the number of
packets and their duration.

- Each continuous feature has its related minimum and maximum values, which are obtained

from the training data distribution, thus forming 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 relationships.

- The port number and connection type have one-hot encoded 𝑂𝐻𝐸 dependencies.

Attack algorithm on raw data representation. The attacker’s goal is to have a connection log
classified as Benign instead of Malicious. We assume that the attacker communicates with an
external IP under its control (for instance, the command-and-control IP), and thus has full control of
the malicious traffic in that connection. We assume that the attacker can only add traffic to network
connections, by increasing the number of bytes, packets, and connection duration, to preserve
the malicious functionality. For simplicity, we set the number of received packets and bytes to 0,
assuming that the external IP does not respond to these connections. We assume that the attacker
does not have access to the security monitor that collects the logs and cannot modify directly the
log data.

The attack algorithm follows the framework from Algorithm 1. There is only one family of de-
pendent features, including the packets and bytes sent, and connection duration. The representative
feature is the number of sent packets, which is updated with the gradient value, following a binary

search for perturbation 𝛿, as specified in Algorithm UPDATE_FAMILY. The dependent number of
bytes sent and duration features are updated using the update dependency functions (Update_Ratio,
Update_Range and Update_OHE), thus preserving the 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜, 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 and 𝑂𝐻𝐸 dependencies.
Engineered Features. Another possibility is to use domain knowledge to create features that
improve classification accuracy. A standard method for creating network traffic features is aggre-
gation by destination port to capture relevant traffic statistics per port (e.g., [25], [49]). This is
motivated by the fact that different network services and protocols run on different ports, and we
expect ports to have different traffic patterns. We select a list of 17 ports for popular applications,
including HTTP (80), SSH (22), and DNS (53). We also add a category called OTHER for connections
on other ports. We aggregate the communication on a port based on a fixed time window (the
length of which is a hyper-parameter set at one minute). For each port, we compute traffic statistics
using the Max, Min, and Total operators for outgoing and incoming connections. See the example
in Figure 3 on the right, in which features extracted for each port define a family of dependent
features. We obtain a total of 756 aggregated traffic features on these 17 ports. Table 5 includes
the feature description. The resulting feature vector includes both types of dependencies. The
domain-specific relationships are the same as for the raw data representation except for the
one-hot encoding relationship. There are additional 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡 mathematical dependencies between
features: the minimum and the maximum number of packets, bytes and duration per connection
must be updated after a change in the total number of packets, bytes, or connections.
Attack algorithm on engineered features. The goal of the attacker here is to change the pre-
diction of a feature vector aggregated over time from Benign to Malicious. Therefore, in this attack
model, the attacker has the ability to insert network connections during the targeted time window
to achieve his goal. Similar to the above scenario, the attacker controls a victim IP and can send
traffic to external IPs under its control. The adversary has a lot of options in mounting the attack
by selecting the protocol, port, and connection features. Here we have 17 families of dependent
features, one for the features on each port.

The attack algorithm against the Neris botnet classification task called the Neris attack follows
the framework from Algorithm 1. First, the feature of the maximum gradient is determined and
the corresponding port is identified. The family of dependent features is all the features computed
for that port. The attacker attempts to add a fixed number of connections on that port (which is a
hyper-parameter of our system). This is done in the INIT_FAMILY function. The attacker can add

either TCP, UDP, or both types of connections, according to the gradient sign for these features
and also respecting network-level constraints. The representative feature for a port’s family is the
number of packets that the attacker sends in a connection. This feature is updated by the gradient
value, following a binary search for perturbation 𝛿, as specified in Algorithm UPDATE_FAMILY .
In the UPDATE_DEP function an update to the aggregated port features is performed. First, we
ensure that the feature corresponding to the number of packets sent satisfies the 𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 and 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡
constraints. Then the difference in the total number of bytes sent by the attacker and duration
is determined from the gradient, followed by the Update_Ratio function to keep the resulting
values inside the feasible domain. The port family also includes features such as Min and Max
sent bytes and connection duration. These features are updated by the Update_Stat function. The
detailed algorithm for INIT_FAMILY and UPDATE_DEP functions of the Neris attack are illustrated
in Algorithm 7 and Algorithm 8.

4.2 Malicious Domain Classifier
The second threat detection application is to classify FQDN domain names contacted by enterprise
hosts as Malicious or Benign. This security application has multiple types of feature-space con-
straints, including linear, non-linear, and statistical dependencies, and therefore can be used to test
our FENCE framework for supporting multiple constraints.

Dataset. We obtained access to a proprietary dataset collected by a company that includes 89
domain features extracted from HTTP proxy logs collected at the border of an enterprise network.
This is the same dataset used for the design of MADE system for detecting malicious activity in
enterprise networks and prioritizing the detected activities according to their risk described in
detail by Oprea et al. [50]. This dataset enables us to experiment with the variety of constraints in
feature space, representative of security applications. Features are aggregated over multiple HTTP
connections to the same external FQDN domain and are defined with the help of security experts.
Each external FQDN is labeled as Malicious or Benign. We group the modifiable features of MADE
into a set of 7 families, included in Table 6. More details on all the features used in MADE are
provided in the original paper [50] (we preserved the feature ID for the MADE dataset in Table 6).
In this application, we do not have access to the raw HTTP traffic, only to features extracted
from it and domain labels. Thus, the constraints are mathematical constraints in feature space,
for instance:

• For the Connection family, we have 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐿𝑖𝑛 dependence: computing average value over a

number of events.

• For the Bytes family, we need to update the ratio of two values and then update minimum,
maximum and average values, thus, we have the combination of 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡 and 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐿𝑖𝑛 dependen-
cies.

• For the HTTP Method, we have the same combination of 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡 and 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐿𝑖𝑛 dependencies as

for Bytes family.

• For the Content family, we need to ensure that the sum of all ratio values equals 1. This is a

combination of 𝐿𝑖𝑛 and 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐿𝑖𝑛 dependencies.

• For the Result Code, we also need to ensure that the sum of all fraction values equals to
1. Additionally, the number of connections with different codes must sum up to the total
number of connections. This is a combination of 𝐿𝑖𝑛 and 𝑁𝑜𝑛𝐿𝑖𝑛 dependencies.

Attack algorithm. We assume that we add events to the logs, and never delete or modify existing
events. For instance, we can insert more connections, as in the malicious connection classifier.
The attack algorithm against the malicious domain classifier called the MADE attack follows the
framework from Algorithm 1. If the feature of the maximum gradient has no dependencies, it is just
updated with the gradient value. Otherwise, every dependency family has a specific representative
feature and is updated following one of the specified UPDATE_DEP functions. For example, for the
Connection family, the representative feature is Num_Conn, which is updated with the gradient
value, and other features in this family are updated by calling the Update_Stat function. The
detailed algorithm for the UPDATE_DEP function of the MADE attack is illustrated in Algorithm 9.
The functions for updating dependencies (e.g., Update_Stat, Update_Lin, Update_NonLin) are the
same defined in the FENCE framework and discussed in Section 3.4.

5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION FOR NETWORK TRAFFIC CLASSIFIER
We evaluate FENCE for the malicious network traffic classifier trained with both the raw data
and engineered feature representations. We show feasible attacks that insert a small number of
network connections to change the Malicious prediction to Benign. We only analyze the FENCE
attack with the Projected optimization objective here. In the following section, we analyze our
FENCE framework for the malicious domain classifier for both the Projected and Penalty attacks.

5.1 Experimental setup
CTU-13 is a collection of 13 scenarios including both legitimate traffic from a university campus
network, as well as labeled connections of malicious botnets [25]. We restrict to three scenarios for
the Neris botnet (1, 2, and 9). We choose to train on two of the scenarios and test the models on the
third, to guarantee independence between training and testing data.

The raw data representation has 3,712,935 data points, from which 151,625 are labeled as botnets.
The attacker can modify three features per connection: bytes and packets sent, and duration. The
training data in the engineered features representation has 3869 Malicious examples, and 194,259
Benign examples, and an imbalance ratio of 1:50. There is a set of 432 statistical features that the
attacker can modify (the ones that correspond to the characteristics of sent traffic on 17 ports). The
physical constraints and statistical dependencies in both scenarios have been detailed in Section 4.1.
We considered two baseline attacks: Baseline 1 (in which the features that are modified iteratively
are selected at random), and Baseline 2 (in which, additionally, the amount of perturbation is
sampled from a standard normal distribution 𝑁 (0, 1)).

5.2 Attack results for raw data representation
For training we have used FFNN with two layers and a sigmoid activation function. The architecture
that corresponds to the best performance has 12 neurons in the first layer, and 1 neuron in the
second layer. We have trained it using Adam optimizer with a learning rate equal to 0.0001 for 20

epochs with batch size 64. The best results are for training on scenarios 2 and 9, and testing on
scenario 1, with an F1 score of 0.70.

We consider an attack on testing scenario 1, and the success rate of our attack is 100% already at
a small 𝐿2 distance of 2. Intuitively, an attacker can add a few packets and bytes to a connection
and change its classification easily. We compare its performance to Baseline 2, which achieves only
73% success rate at 𝐿2 distance of 2.

5.3 Attack results for engineered features
We perform model selection and training for a number of FFNN architectures on all combinations
of two scenarios, and tested the models for generality on the third scenario. The best architecture
consists of three layers with 256, 128 and 64 hidden layers. We used the Adam optimizer, 50 epochs
for training, a mini-batch of 64, and a learning rate of 0.00026. The F1 and AUC scores are much
better than the FFNN based on raw data representation. For instance, the best scenario is training
on 1, 9, and testing on 2, which achieve an F1 score of 0.97, compared to 0.70 for raw data.

We thus perform a more extensive analysis of the attack against engineered features in this
scenario. The testing data for the attack is 407 Malicious examples from scenario 2, among which
397 were predicted correctly by the classifier.

Evasion attack performance. First, we analyze the attack success rate with respect to the allowed
perturbation, shown in Figure 4a. The attack reaches 99% success rate at 𝐿2 distance 16. Interestingly,
in this case the two baselines perform poorly, demonstrating again the clear advantages of our
framework. We plot next the ROC curves under evasion attack in Figure 4b (using the 407 Malicious
examples and 407 Benign examples from testing scenario 2). At distance 8, the AUC score is 0.93
(compared to 0.98 without adversarial examples), but there is a sudden change at distance 10, with
the AUC score dropping to 0.77. Moreover, at distance 12, the AUC reaches 0.12, showing the
model’s degradation under evasion attack with relatively small distance.

Table 9. 𝐿2 norm statistics for training data (top row) and perturbation added by the Projected attack (bottom
row).

The average number of port families updated during the attack is shown in Figure 4c. The
maximum number is 3 ports, but it decreases to 1 port at distance higher than 12. While counter-
intuitive, at larger distances the attacker can add larger perturbation to the aggregated statistics
of one port, crossing the decision boundary. The ports most frequently modified are 443 and 80,
which are the ports with most network traffic.

Adversarial examples. We show an adversarial example generated by the Projected attack at
distance 14. The attacker adds only 12 TCP connections on port 443, including 87 packets, each of
size 1292 bytes, with connection duration of 432.47 seconds. Table 7 shows one of the 12 attacker-
generated connections to create the adversarial example. The destination IP can be selected by
the attacker so that it is under its control and does not send any bytes or packets. These new
connections are added to the activity the attacker already does inside the network, so the malicious
functionality of the attack is preserved. Interestingly, all adversarial attacks succeed with at most
12 new connections at distances higher than 10. In Table 8 we show statistics for the duration,
sent bytes and sent packets features in the training data. We make the observation that the feature
values in the resulting adversarial example are below the average feature values of the training
data. In particular, the Orig_Bytes feature has an average value 150KB and a very high standard
deviation (12.9MB), while the adversarial example only uses 112,404 bytes, which is very little
communication (112KB).

Furthermore, we illustrate the 𝐿2 norm statistics of samples in the training data along with 𝐿2
norms of perturbations added to create adversarial examples at distance 8 in Table 9. We observe
that the average 𝐿2 perturbation norm (7.66) is 4.97 times lower than the training data average 𝐿2
norm (38.12). Given that the standard deviation (0.57) and maximum value (7.99) of the perturbation
𝐿2 norm are small compared to the standard deviation (98.85) and the maximum value (890.56) of
the 𝐿2 norm of training samples, we consider the resulting adversarial attacks stealthy.

6 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION FOR MALICIOUS DOMAIN CLASSIFIER
In this section we perform a detailed evaluation of the FENCE attack on the MADE malicious domain
classifier trained on the enterprise dataset [50]. We compare the Projected and Penalty optimization
methods and analyze the impact of imbalanced training datasets. We also test the transferability of
the FENCE attacks across other models and architectures and evaluate the potential of adversarial
training as mitigation against FENCE evasion attacks.

6.1 Experimental setup
The data for training and testing the models was extracted from security logs collected by web
proxies at the border of a large enterprise network with over 100,000 hosts. The number of monitored
external domains in the training set is 227,033, among which 1730 are classified as Malicious and
225,303 are Benign. For training, we sampled a subset of training data to include 1230 Malicious
domains, and a different number of Benign domains to get several imbalance ratios between the
two classes (1, 5, 15, 25, and 50). We used the remaining 500 Malicious domains and sampled 500
Benign domains for testing the evasion attack. Overall, the dataset includes 89 features from 7
categories.

Among the features included in the dataset, we determined a set of 31 features that can be
modified by an attacker (see Table 6 for their description). These include communication-related
features (e.g., number of connections, number of bytes sent and received, etc.), as well as some
independent features (e.g., number of levels in the domain or domain registration age). Other
features in the dataset (for example, those using URL parameters or values) are more difficult to
change, and we consider them immutable during the evasion attack.

This dataset is extremely imbalanced, and we sample a different number of Benign domains from
the data, to control the imbalance ratio. We are interested in how the imbalance affects the attack
success rate. On this dataset, we also compare the Projected and Penalty attack objectives.

6.2 FENCE attack evaluation
We experimented with several models for training classifiers, including logistic regression, random
forest, and different FFNN architectures. The best performance was achieved by a two-layer FFNN
with 80 neurons in the first layer, and 50 neurons in the second layer. ReLU activation function
is used after all hidden layers except for the last layer, which uses sigmoid. We used the Adam
optimizer and SGD with different learning rates. The best results were obtained with Adam and a
learning rate of 0.0003. We trained for 75 epochs with a mini-batch size of 32. The resulting model
had an AUC score of 89% with cross-validation, in the balanced case. These results were comparable
to the best random forest model we trained and better than logistic regression.

The ROC curves for training logistic regression, random forest and FFNN are given in Figure 5
(a), while the results for FFNN with different imbalanced ratios are in Figure 5 (b). Interestingly,
the performance of the model increases to 93% AUC for an imbalance ratio up to 25, after which it
starts to decrease (with AUC of 83% at a ratio of 50). Our intuition is that the FFNN model achieves
better performance when more training data is available (up to a ratio of 25). But once the Benign
class dominates the Malicious one (at ratio of 50), the model performance starts to degrade.

FENCE Projected attack results. We evaluate the success rate of the attack with Projected
objective first for balanced classes (1:1 ratio). We compare in Figure 6a the attack against the two
baselines. The attacks are run on 412 Malicious testing examples classified correctly by the FFNN.
The Projected attack improves both baselines, with Baseline 2 performing much worse, reaching
success rate of 57% at a distance of 20, and Baseline 1 has a success of 91.7% compared to our attack
(98.3% success). This shows that the attacks are still performing reasonably if feature selection
is done randomly, but it is very important to add perturbation to features consistent with the
optimization objective.

We also measure in Figure 6b the decrease in the model’s performance before and after the
evasion attack at different perturbations (using 500 Malicious and 500 Benign examples not used
in training). While the AUC score is 0.87 originally, it drastically decreases to 0.52 under evasion
attack at perturbation 7. This shows the significant degradation of the model’s performance under
evasion attack.

Finally, we run the attack at different imbalance ratios and measure its success for different
perturbations. In this experiment, we select 62 test examples that all models (trained for different
imbalance ratios) classified correctly before the evasion attack. The results are illustrated in Figure 6c.
At 𝐿2 distance 20, the evasion attack achieves a 100% success rate for all ratios except 1. Additionally,
we observe that with a higher imbalance, it is easier for the attacker to find adversarial examples
(at a fixed distance). One reason is that models that have lower performance (such as the model
trained with 1:50) are easier to attack. Second, we believe that as the imbalance gets higher the
model becomes more biased towards the majority class (Benign), which is the target class of the
attacker, making it easier to cross the decision boundary between classes.

We include an adversarial example in Table 10. We only show the features that are modified by
the attack and their original value. As we observe, the attack preserves the feature dependencies: the
average ratio of received bytes over sent bytes (Avg_Ratio_Bytes) is consistent with the number of
received (Total_Recv_Bytes) and sent (Total_Sent_Bytes) bytes. In addition, the attack modifies the
domain registration age, an independent feature, relevant to malicious domain classification [45].
However, there is a higher cost to change this feature: the attacker should register a malicious
domain and wait to get a larger registration age. If this cost is prohibitive, we can easily modify our
framework to make this feature immutable.

We constructed 45 adversarial examples at 𝐿2 distance 20 and calculated the average perturbation
for every feature that was modified to show that the adversarial examples generated at this distance
are unnoticeable. The results can be found in Table 11. Additionally, we include statistics for the
features on the training dataset in Table 12. We observe that the generated adversarial examples

have stealthy perturbations, given the feature distribution and meaning. For example, the number
of sent bytes is increased by 17195.3 (17.19KB), the registration age of a domain is increased on
average by 1.14 days, while the number of sub domains is increased by 0.28 on average.Moreover,
all average perturbations are much smaller than the standard deviation of features in the training
data. For instance, the average perturbation of the sub domains number is 0.28 compared to the
corresponding standard deviation of 2867.53 in the training data. This additionally confirms the
fact that the generated perturbations for adversarial examples can be considered unnoticeable.

Finally, we show the 𝐿2 norm statistics of samples in the training data along with the 𝐿2 norm
of perturbations added to create adversarial examples by the Projected attack at distance 5 in
the first two rows of Table 13. Even if we used a distance of 5 in the Projected attack, many of
the generated perturbations have lower norm (in particular, half of the adversarial examples at
distance 5 have norm lower than 3.17). The average 𝐿2 norm of perturbation (3.20) is much smaller
than the standard deviation of the training samples 𝐿2 norm (26.9), resulting in relatively stealthy
perturbations. Additionally, the maximum 𝐿2 norm of perturbation (5) is only a 0.005 fraction of
the maximum possible 𝐿2 norm of the training samples (890).

FENCE Penalty attack results. We now discuss the results achieved by applying our attack
with the Penalty objective on the testing examples. Similar to the Projected attack, we compare
the success rate of the Penalty attack to the two types of baseline attacks for balanced classes,
in Figure 7a (using the 412 Malicious testing examples classified correctly). Overall, the Penalty
objective is performing worse than the Projected one, reaching 79% success rate at 𝐿2 distance
of 20. We observe that in this case both baselines perform worse, and the attack improves upon
both baselines significantly. The decrease of the model’s performance under the Penalty attack is
illustrated in Figure 7b (for 500 Malicious and 500 Benign testing examples). While AUC is 0.87
originally on the testing dataset, it decreases to 0.59 under the evasion attacks at the maximum
allowed perturbation of 7. Furthermore, we measure the attack success rate at different imbalance

better, and it works best at imbalance ratio of 50.

We include an adversarial example generated by the Penalty attack in Table 14. We only show
the features that were updated by the attack, which modifies only the amount of bytes sent (by
4.7KB) and the bytes received (by 73KB). The attack is able to preserve the 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜 dependency:
Avg_Ratio_Bytes = Total_Recv_Bytes/Total_Sent_Bytes/NIP.

We constructed 45 adversarial examples at 𝐿2 distance 20 for the Penalty attack and calculated
the average perturbation for every modified feature. The results are illustrated in Table 15. Given
the meaning of the features, we can conclude that an 𝐿2 distance of 20 can be considered reasonable
to generate undetectable attacks. For instance: the Num_GET feature is increased only by 2.19
on average, meaning that the attacker needs to add only 2 or 3 additional GET requests to the

Attack comparison. We compare the success rate of our Projected and Penalty FENCE attacks
with the C&W attack, as well as an attack we call Post-processing. The Post-processing attack runs
directly the original C&W developed for continuous domains, after which it projects the adversarial
example to the raw input space to enforce the constraints. For each family of dependent features,
the attack retains the value of the representative feature but then modifies the dependent features
using the UPDATE_DEP function. The success rate of all these attacks is shown in Figure 8, using
the 412 Malicious testing examples classified correctly. The attacks based on our FENCE framework
(with Projected and Penalty objectives) perform best, as they account for feature dependencies
during the adversarial example generation. The attack with the Projected objective has the highest
performance. The vanilla C&W has slightly worse performance at small perturbation values, even
though it does not take into consideration the feature constraints and works in an enlarged feature
space. Interestingly, the Post-processing attack performs worse (reaching only 0.005% success at
a distance of 20 – can generate 2 out of 412 adversarial examples). This demonstrates that it is
not sufficient to run state-of-the-art attacks for continuous domains and then adjust the feature
dependencies, but more sophisticated attack strategies are needed.

Fig. 9. Feature modification statistics for malicious domain classifier.

Number and importance of features modified. We compare how many features were modified
in order to generate each of the three attacks: Projected, Penalty, and C&W.

It is not surprising that the C&W attack modifies almost all features, as it works in 𝐿2 norms
without any restriction in feature space. Both the Projected and the Penalty attacks modify a much
smaller number of features (4 on average).

We are interested in determining if there is a relationship between feature importance and choice
of feature by the optimization algorithm. For additional details on feature description, we include
the list of features that can be modified in Table 6.

We observe that features of higher importance are chosen more frequently by the optimization
attack. However, since we are modifying the representative feature in each family, the number of
modifications on the representative feature is usually higher (it accumulates all the importance
of the features in that family). For the Bytes family, feature 3 (number of received bytes) is the
representative feature and it is updated more than 350 times. However, for features that have no
dependencies (e.g., 68 – number of levels in the domain, 69 – number of sub-domains, 71 – domain
registration age, and 72 – domain registration validity), the number of updates corresponds to the
feature importance.

6.3 Misclassification of Benign Samples as Malicious
We ran the Projected and Penalty attacks for changing the classification of Benign inputs to
Malicious to show the generality of the FENCE framework. The success rate of the attacks compared
to two baseline attacks for balanced classes is illustrated in Figure 10. Both attacks achieve high
success rate: At 𝐿2 = 20 the Projected attack reaches 92% success rate and the Penalty attack reaches
95% success rate. The FENCE attack performs significantly better compared to both baseline attacks.

6.4 Attack Transferability
We consider here a threat model in which the adversary only knows the feature representation, but
not the exact ML model or the training data. One approach to generate adversarial examples is
through transferability [20, 44, 51, 67, 71]. We perform several experiments to test the transferability
of the Projected attacks against FFNN to logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Models
were trained with different data and we vary the imbalance ratio. The results are in Table 16. We
observe that the largest transferability rate to both LR and RF is for the highest imbalanced ratio of
50 (98.2% adversarial examples transfer to LR and 94.8% to RF). As we increase the imbalance ratio,
the transfer rate increases and the transferability rate to LR is lower than to RF.

rate higher than 96%), confirming that weaker models are easier to attack.

6.5 Mitigations
Finally, we looked at defensive approaches to increase the FFNN robustness against the FENCE
evasion attack. A well-known defensive technique is adversarial training [27, 46]. We trained
FFNN using adversarial training with the Projected attack at 𝐿2 distance 20. We trained the model
adversarially for 11 epochs and obtained the AUC score of 89% (each epoch takes approximately 7
hours). We measured the Projected attack’s success rate for the balanced case against the standard
and adversarially training models in Figure 11. Interestingly, the success rate of the evasion attacks
significantly drops for the adversarially-trained model and reaches only 16.5% at 20 𝐿2 distance.
This demonstrates that adversarial training is a promising direction for designing robust ML models
for security. We plan to investigate it further and optimize its design in future work.

7 RELATED WORK
Adversarial machine learning studies ML vulnerabilities against attacks [35]. Research on the
robustness of DNNs at testing time started with the work of Biggio et al. [8] and Szegedy et
al. [68]. They showed that classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples generated with minimal
perturbation to testing inputs. Since then, the area of adversarial ML has received a lot of attention,
with the majority of work focused on evasion attacks (at testing time), e.g., [6, 11, 27, 39, 52, 53, 62].
Other classes of attacks include poisoning (e.g., [9, 77]) and privacy attacks (e.g., [23, 63]), but we
focus here on evasion attacks.
Evasion attacks in security. Several evasion attacks have been proposed against models with
discrete and constrained input vectors, as encountered in security. The majority of these use
datasets with binary features, not considering dependencies in feature space. Biggio et al. [8] use a
gradient-based attack to construct adversarial examples for malicious PDF detection by only adding

new keywords to PDFs. Grosse et al. [30] leverage the JSMA attack by Papernot et al. [53] for a
malware classification application in which features can be added or removed. Suciu et al. [66]
add bytes to malicious binaries either at the end or in slack regions to create adversarial examples.
Kreuk [37] discover regions in executables that would not affect the intended malware behavior.
Kolosnjaji et al. [36] create gradient-based attack against malware detection DNNs that learn from
raw bytes, and can create adversarial examples by only changing a few specific bytes at the end of
each malware sample. Xu et al. [78] propose a black-box attack based on genetic algorithms for
manipulating PDF files while maintaining the required format. Dang et al. [18] propose a black-box
attack against PDF malware classifiers that uses hill-climbing over a set of feasible transformations.
Anderson et al. [4] construct a general black-box framework based on reinforcement learning for
attacking static portable executable anti-malware engines. Kulynych et al. [38] propose a graphical
framework for discrete domains with guarantees of minimal adversarial cost. Recently, Pierazzi et
al. [55] define a formalization for the domain-space attacks, along with a new white-box attack
against Android malware classification. The authors use automated software transplantation to
extract slices of bytecode from benign applications and inject them into a malicious host to mimic
the benign activity and evade the classifier. Chen et al. [14] proposed an evasion attack called
EvnAttack on malware present in portable Windows executable files, where input vectors are
binary features each representing an API call to Windows.

Evasion attacks for network traffic classifiers include: Apruzesse et al. [5] analyzing the ro-
bustness of random forest for botnet classification; Clements et al. [16] evaluating the robustness
of an anomaly detection method [48] against existing attacks; and De Lucia et al. [19] attacking
an SVM for network scanning detection. A number of papers perform attacks against intrusion
detection systems (IDS). Among them, Warzynski and Kołaczek [74] consider an FGSM attack
under L1 norm against IDS and illustrates the ability of the generated adversarial example to
evade the classifier. Rigaki et al. [57] generate targeted attacks by using FGSM and JSMA to evade
decision tree, random forest, linear SVM, voting ensembles of the previous three classifiers, and
a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network IDS. Similarly, Wang et al [73] leveraged FGSM,
JSMA, Deepfool, and Carlini-Wagner to attack an MLP neural network for intrusion detection. Yang
et al. [81] used Carlini-Wagner, a GAN attack, and black-box ZOO attacks against IDS DNNs. In
their work Martins et al. [47] tested the performance of FGSM, JSMA, Deepfool, and Carlini-Wagner
attacks against decision tree, random forest, SVM, naive Bayes, neural networks, and denoising
autoencoders intrusion detection models. Wu et al. [76] applied deep reinforcement learning to
generate adversarial attacks on botnet attacks. Yan et al. [80] generate adversarial examples for
denial of service attacks. Lin et al. [43] use a modification of GAN called IDSGAN to produce
adversarial examples while retaining functional features of the attack.

Evasion attacks with dependency constraints. A number of attacks that preserve constraints
between extracted features in security exist in the literature. We survey these papers in greater
detail and add a comparison to FENCE in Table 18.

Alhajjar et al. [2] explore the use of evolutionary computations and generative adversarial
networks as a tool for crafting adversarial examples that aim to evade machine learning models
used for network traffic classification. These strategies were applied to the NSL-KDD and UNSW-
NB15 datasets. The paper operates only in features space, and the following dependencies are
preserved: binary features, linear dependencies and features that can only be increased. There
is no limitation on the amount of perturbations, as the authors claim that large changes in data
are not subject to easy recognition by human observers. The percent of successful evasion for
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is much worse for both datasets than in FENCE: maximum 86.18%
for NSL-KDD using GANs, and 55.10% for the UNSW-NB15 dataset. In contrast, FENCE minimizes

the perturbation needed for evasion, preserves a much larger number of dependencies, such as
non-linear, statistical, or combination of them, achieving a higher success rate.

Granados et al. [28] introduce Restricted Traffic Distribution Attack (RTDA) against network
traffic classifiers, which is based on the Carlini and Wagner attack. In order to ensure the feasibility
of adversarial examples, the attack only modifies the features corresponding to different percentiles
for packet sizes by increasing their values and preserving the monotonic non-decreasing property
of generated packet-size distribution. The attacker operates only in feature space, and there is
no limit on bytes added to the packet, which may result in the packet sizes that are larger than
allowed by network protocols. In contrast, FENCE generates more realistic attacks in the real-world
scenario, by adding new connections of different types (UDP/TCP) and on different ports. Moreover,
FENCE ensures feasibility by preserving packet sizes, connection durations, and other network
traffic characteristics according to the constraints of network protocols.

Abusnaina et al. [1] present MergeFlow attack against DDoS detection models. They create
adversarial examples by combining features from existing network flow with a representative mask
flow from the target class. The features are combined either through averaging for ratio features
or accumulating for count-based features. This attack preserves dependencies between features
but generates large perturbations. Abusnaina et al. present similar ideas against graph-based IoT
Malware Detection System that creates realistic adversarial examples by combining the original
graph with a selected targeted class.

Sadeghzadeh et al. [59] introduce an adversarial network traffic attack (ANT) that uses a universal
adversarial perturbation (UAP) generating method. To generate ANT they introduce the following
three types of attack: AdvPad injects UAP to the content of packets to evaluate the robustness
of packet classifiers, AdvPay injects UAP into payload if a dummy packet to evaluate flow-based
classifiers, and AdvBurst modifies a burst of the flow to test the robustness of flow time-series
classifiers. In order to generate the UAP, a set of flows or packets from a particular class is leveraged
and the UAP is inserted into new incoming traffic of that class. This attack works in the domain
space by inserting payload, dummy packet with payload, or the sequence of packets with statistical
features. All perturbations are calculated by inserting the randomly initialized perturbation vector
into examples from the target class and optimizing the loss function towards the selected class for
some number of iterations. Sequences of bytes were used for training the classifiers, thus, there are
no dependencies in the domain space. The only thing that needs to be preserved is the range for
the number of bytes achieved by performing the clipping operation while computing UAP.

Han et al. [31] propose a practical traffic-space evasion attack against Network Intrusion Detection
System (NIDS). The attacker can modify the original traffic generated from devices he controls at
an affordable overhead. It has two main steps: finding the adversarial feature vector which can be
classified as benign but is close to the malicious feature vector in terms of features’ values (lies
in the low-confidence region of the classifier) using the GAN model and transforming malicious
original traffic to transfer its features to the closest adversarial ones preserving its functionality
using particle swarm optimization (PSO). While performing the second step authors allow only to
modify the interarrival time of packets in the original traffic, and for the injected crafted traffic the
attacker is able to alter the interarrival time of packets, protocol layer of packets, and payload size.
The budget overhead for the number of buckets and time elapsed is controlled by the rate of the
original traffic. Feature dependencies are preserved in the domain space only, in contrast, FENCE
allows to additionally preserve complex mathematical dependencies in feature space.

Chen et al. [13] introduce two types of evasion attacks against machine learning-based intrusion
detection systems. The first attack called 𝑂𝑝𝑡 uses an iterative optimization approach to find the
adversarial examples that maximize the probability of malicious output while remaining stealthy
and preserving the Range dependency. The second attack detaches the malicious payload from

the input vector, and then optimizes the modifiable features based on a GAN under the Range
dependency, keeping some features as integers. Thus, both attacks preserve only domain-specific
dependencies, while FENCE is capable of satisfying a larger amount of domain dependencies as
well as a list of mathematical constraints.

None of these previous works can handle the same amount of domain and mathematical depen-
dencies supported by our FENCE framework. In Table 18 we compare FENCE with these attacks
against network traffic classifiers and include the list of supported constraints.

Table 18. Comparison to existing work on evasion attacks in cybersecurity domains. We only include methods
which respect dependencies in feature space. For each method, we mention the adversarial attack algorithm
and the supported feature dependencies.

Evasion attacks in other domains. There is work on designing attacks in other domains, such as
audio: [26], [15], [85], [64], [60], [79], [12] [56]; text: [54], [21], [42], [24], [3]; and video: [40], [33], [75].
Physically realizable attacks have been designed for face recognition [61] and vision [22].

Defenses against evasion attacks. Standard methods to defend against adversarial evasion
attacks in continuous domains include: adversarial training [46], randomized smoothing [17], and
defenses based on the detection of adversarial examples [41, 58, 82–84]. Randomized smoothing
provides certifiable guarantees, but unfortunately, it cannot be directly applied in discrete domains
because it requires the classifier to be evaluated on inputs perturbed with Gaussian noise. Therefore,
we are not aware of any uses of randomized smoothing and similar randomization-based mechanism
for cyber security defenses.

Defenses based on adversarial training have been used in cyber security. For instance, Abusnaina
et al. [1] validate whether adversarial training improves the robustness of the DDoS detection
system. They show that adversarial training is able to improve the robustness of the anomaly
classification model, but only for certain types of adversarial examples included in the adversarial
training. Hashem et al. [32] develop a network intrusion detection system that utilizes a novel

31

reconstruction from partial observation method to build a more accurate anomaly detection model.
The method also improves robustness to adversarial examples.

Methods for the detection of adversarial examples in security have been proposed. For example,
Wang et al. [72] propose a defense mechanism against adversarial examples for NIDS, which exploits
the inconsistency between manifold evaluation and model inference along with the closeness of the
resulting adversarial example to the manifold. This allows them to train a logistic regression that
predicts whether the input may be considered adversarial or not. In general, a known limitation
of detection methods is that they fail in face of adaptive attacks. Tramer et al. [70] showed that
multiple detection-based methods (e.g. [58]) are not resilient against adaptive attacks, and thus
designing detection-based defenses in cyber security which are resilient to adaptive attacks remains
an open problem.

8 CONCLUSIONS
We showed that evasion attacks against DNNs can be designed to preserve the dependencies in
feature space in constrained domains. We proposed a general framework FENCE for generating
adversarial examples that respects mathematical dependencies and domain-specific constraints
imposed by these applications. We demonstrated evasion attacks that insert a small number of
network connections (12 records in Zeek connection logs) to misclassify Malicious activity as
Benign in a malicious connection classifier. We also showed that adversarial training has the
potential to increase the robustness of classifiers in the malicious domain setting.
Our FENCE framework is not restricted to security applications, and we plan to apply it to healthcare
and financial scenarios. An important open problem in this space is how to increase the resilience
of DNN classifiers used in critical, constrained applications.
