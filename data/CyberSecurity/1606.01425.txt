Abstract  

Improving  employees’  understanding  of  digital  forensic  technical  terms  and  concepts  within  an 
organisation  is  likely  to  increase  the  potential  of  successful  collaboration  during  a  cyber  security 
incident (e.g. data breach) investigation within that organisation. In this paper, we seek to determine 
whether  multimedia  presentations,  in  this  case  videos,  are  an  effective  tool  in  improving  a  learner’s 
technical  understanding  of  digital  forensic  terms  and  concepts.  Using  the  cognitive  theory  of 
multimedia  learning  as  the  underlying  theoretical  lens,  we  surveyed  nine  participants  from  the 
financial sector who have cyber security-related responsibilities. With the exception of one participant, 
the study found that the use of multimedia presentations can improve participants’ understanding of 
technical digital forensic terms and concepts. Potential future research questions are also identified. 

Keywords

Introduction 

Cyberattacks  and  cybercrime,  including  those  against  financial  services  institutions,  are  becoming 
more  frequent,  sophisticated  and  cross-border  (Choo  2011;  Cuomo  and  Lawsky  2014).  In  the 
investigation  of  a  cybersecurity  incident,  identification,  preservation,  analysis  and  presentation  of 
evidence (a process known as digital forensics – McKemmish 1999) can be used to guide an incident 
response investigation that seeks to answer six key questions of the incident (i.e. what, why, how, who, 
when and where). 

For this reason, an understanding of digital forensics is essential to both law enforcement and private 
sector organisations (Ab Rahman and Choo 2015a; Nance et al. 2010; Quick et al. 2013; Yasinsac et al. 
2003). For the latter, incident response and investigation processes can be expedited if organisations 
have a sound understanding of incident response and digital forensic principles (Ab Rahman and Choo 
2015b; Nance et al. 2010), and their incident response team is forensically trained. This need has been 
covered  in  the  academic  literature,  with  scholars,  such  as  Ab  Rahman  and  Choo  (2015a),  Kessler 
(2011) and Vidal and Choo (2015), highlighting the need for incident responders and investigators to 
have an improved understanding of digital forensics. Education and training programs are, therefore, 
necessary  to  equip  incident  responders  and  investigators  with  the  skills  to  assess  both  the  digital 
evidence presented and the digital forensic investigation that was conducted, specific to the case. 

Multimedia  presentations,  commonly  characterised  by  narration  and  animation  (Mayer  and  Moreno 
2002), include a variety of distinct media such as text, image, audio and video (Prabhakaran 2000). 
Mayer  emphasised  the  role  of  multimedia  presentations  as  an  effective  training  method,  as  the 
combination  of  spoken  text  and  animation  can  result  in  a  deeper  understanding  for  learners  (Mayer

Cahyani et al. 
Increasing Digital Forensic Understanding using Multimedia 

2003).  Multimedia  presentations  have  been  identified  as  effective  in  empowering  learners’ 
understanding of  business materials in sectors, such as banking and finance (Gunasekaran and Love 
1999), as well as explaining concepts such as DNA (Hewson and Goodman-Delahunty 2008; Schmitt 
2007) and restorative justice (Varfi et al. 2014). In an earlier work, we sought to determine the utility 
or  effectiveness  of  multimedia  presentations  in  digital  forensics  training.  We  conducted  a 
questionnaire-based  survey  using  a  convenient  sample  of  judges,  investigators,  prosecutors  and  staff 
from three provinces in Indonesia. Our findings showed that all participants had an increased level of 
understanding after viewing the educational videos (Cahyani et al. 2016). 

In  this  paper,  we  extend  our  previous  study  to  include  participants  from  a  different  industry  sector, 
namely: the financial sector, seeking to answer the following question: “Are multimedia presentations 
(i.e.  videos)  an  effective  tool  to  improve  a  learner’s  technical  understanding  of  digital  forensic  terms 
and concepts?”. 

2  Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning 

The cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer and Moreno 2002) identifies two channels in the 
human  information  processing  system,  representing  verbal  (narration)  and  visual  (animation) 
channels. According to the theory, learners will identify aspects of the words in the narration via the 
verbal channel, and other aspects will be pictures in the animation through the visual channel. Then, 
learners  will  organise  these  words  and  pictures  so  that  they  can  be  correlated.  Finally,  learners  will 
build  a  connection  with  their  prior  knowledge  in  order  to  learn  new  knowledge  based  on  what  they 
have  just  received.  The  main  concept  of  the  cognitive  theory  of  multimedia  learning  is  depicted  in 
Figure 1. 

This  theory  is  useful  as  the  underlying  theoretical  lens  in  designing  multimedia  presentations  for 
laypersons  (i.e.  untrained  or  unfamiliar  with  digital  forensic  terminologies).  As  depicted  in  Figure  1, 
the content materials are scientific text and animation. 

Figure 1: A Cognitive theory of multimedia learning (adapted from Mayer and Moreno 2002, p. 111) 

In the theory, Mayer and Moreno (2002) recommend five aids to computer-based multimedia learning 
(see  Figure  2).  These  aids  represent  principles  in  instructional  design  to  maximise  the  benefits  of 
multimedia  presentations.  For  this  study,  the  multimedia  and  contiguity  principles  were  adopted  in 
the multimedia presentations because they were found to be the two most significant principles in the 
improvement of a learner’s understanding  by Mayer and Moreno (2002). Meanwhile, the coherence, 
modality, and redundancy principles were adapted, which allow us to emphasise on the use of sounds 
and on-screen text.

3  Research Methodology 

3.1  Participants 

The  sample  consisted  of  nine  participants  who  attended  the  “Cyber  Resilience  in  Financial 
Institutions”  workshop  conducted  by  the  last  author  in  Singapore  during  March  2015.  These 
participants  held  senior  positions  with  cyber  security-related  responsibilities,  and  their  socio- 
demographic information is listed in Table 1. 

Three of the participants (33.3%) were aged between 26 and 35 years, and the remaining participants 
were aged between 36 and 55 years. Eight of the participants (88.9%) were from East Asia (Malaysia, 
Myanmar,  Singapore,  Vietnam)  and  one  participant  was  from  Spain.  Only  four  participants  were 
native  English  speakers,  and  only  one  participant  had  not  obtained  at  least  a  Bachelor’s  degree.  All 
participants work in the financial sector.  The participants were also asked to self-rate their technical 
literacy level (1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest).

Table 1. Participants’ Background Information 

3.2  Interview Materials 

The  questionnaire,  adapted  from  our  previous  study  (Cahyani  et  al.  2016),  was  divided  into  three 
parts.  In  the  first  part,  we  surveyed  the  participants’  socio-demographic  background.  In  the  second 
part, we asked the participants to provide a definition for the three technical terms common to cyber 
security  or  digital  forensic  investigations,  namely  “Cloud  Computing”,  “Botnet”,  and  “Forensic  File 
Recovery”.  The  participants  were  advised  to  answer  “unfamiliar”  if  they  were  not  familiar  with  the 
term. 

The  term  cloud  computing  was  chosen  due  to  the  increasing  adoption  of  cloud  services  by  financial 
institutions (Nicoletti 2013). As such, an understanding of cloud technical concepts is critical for both 
investigators  and  incident  responders  (Choo  2010;  Rani  and  Gangal  2012).  Botnets  are  commonly 
used  in  cyberattacks,  including  against  cloud  service  providers.  For  example,  specific  botnets,  also 
known  as  financial  botnets,  are  built  to  carry  out  financial  fraud  (Riccardi  et  al.  2010).  Therefore, 
botnet was one of the three terms used in our study. The last term, forensic file recovery, was selected 
as it is a common yet important concept in many digital forensic investigations. 

After  the  participants  had  provided  their  own  definitions  of  the  terms,  they  were  then  shown  the 
multimedia  presentations,  one for each term. After viewing the  presentations they were requested to 
once again define the terms. 

The final part of the interview consisted of two open-ended questions, where participants were able to 
rate  and  comment  on  the  usefulness  (or  limitations)  of  the  multimedia  presentations  in  enhancing 
their  understanding  of  the  three  technical  terminologies  and  concepts,  and  the  multimedia 
presentation  format  and  content.  They  also  had  the  opportunity  to  recommend  any  other  tool(s)  or 
method(s)  that  they  think  would  facilitate  their  understanding,  and  provide  any  further  comments 
regarding the study. 

The  multimedia  presentations  were  originally  developed  at  our  University,  and  were  chosen  or 
customised to fit the five aids proposed by Mayer and Moreno (2002). 

Aid  1.  Multimedia  –The  first  and  second  videos  are  narrated  by  a  male  voice,  and  the  third  video  is 
narrated  by  a  female  voice,  to  provide  voice  and  gender  variety.  Animations  are  used  in  the  videos. 
Video 1 first introduces the cloud definition, followed by a selection of implementations. Similarly, in 
video  2,  the  term  botnet  is  first  defined,  followed  by  an  explanation  of  how  they  are  used  in  a 
cyberattack or cybercrime.  In the last video, the sequence of events that occurs in a file deletion and 
recovery process is explained. 

Aid 2. Contiguity –In the selected videos, when an animation is shown, a supporting narration is also 
played  simultaneously.  However,  the  video  delivery  was  designed  so  that  when  it  is  necessary  to 
emphasise the explanation given in the narration, the animation can be paused. 

For  example,  in  video  1  when  a  narration  explains  what  a  client  can  access  via  a  cloud  service,  the 
animation shows the same frame until the explanation is completed. 

Aid  3.  Coherence  –Since  the  videos’  durations  are  relatively  short  (around  three  to  five  minutes), 
narration  and  word  selection  was  especially  considered  in  order  to  provide  proper  information  to 
support  the  relevant  animation.  For  example,  in  video  2,  words  are  selectively  chosen  to  explain  the 
complex  botnet  formation  process  and  its  attacks.  However,  in  all  three  videos,  appropriate 
background music is used to maintain the attention of the learner. 

Aid  4.  Modality  –This  principle  in  generally  adopted  in  all  three  videos.  However,  we  particularly 
selected videos that use on-screen text in a limited way. We are aware of the importance of integrating 
multiple sources of information (e.g. separate text and diagrams) to  reduce cognitive load (Chandler 
and Sweller 1991). As such, on-screen text is utilised to emphasise the explanation only when needed. 
For  example  in  video  3,  when  the  file  deletion  process  is  explained  narratively,  on-screen  text  about 
the  process  that  has  been  applied  to  the  file  is  displayed  to  assist  the  learner  in  comprehending  the 
sequence of activities conducted and their impact, see Figure 3.

Figure 3: An example of on-screen text usage (video designed by Kwan Wong and Robb Weston, 
University of South Australia) 

Aid 5. Redundancy –Presentation of narration, animation and on-screen text is used simultaneously in 
selected frames to remind the learner about a particular process stage. 

3.3  Procedure 

We used an offline questionnaire, which was manually distributed to the workshop’s participants. One 
hour  was  allocated  for  the  study.  Upon  completion,  the  participants’  responses  were  then  manually 
entered, coded and analysed by the researchers. 

In  order  to  grade  the  participants’  responses  to  the  three  terms  before  and  after  watching  the 
multimedia presentations, we used a grading metric. For example, in the cloud computing video, cloud 
computing  is  defined  in  terms  of  the  deployment  models,  the  associated  benefits,  and  the 
architecture/service  models.  If  participants  only  defined  cloud  computing  as  a  shared  pool  of 
configurable  computing  resources/virtualized  computing  resources,  then  we  would  award  them  a 
maximum of 0.5 marks. Zero marks were assigned only to those who answered unfamiliar or did not 
answer the question. The maximum score for each answer was 3. 

We also computed an ability to comprehend value (  ) for each participant to determine the extent of 
the  impact  of  the  multimedia  presentations  on  their  understanding.  Similar  to  our  earlier  work 
(Cahyani  et  al.  2016),  the  participant’s  ability  to  comprehend  was  calculated  using  the  following 
formula: 

In  the  above  formula,  x 1_Af,  x 2_Af  and  x 3_Af  denote  the  ‘participant’s  understanding’  after  watching 
videos  1,  2  and  3  respectively  while  x 1_Bf,  x 2_Bf  and  x 3_Bf  denote  the  ‘participant’s  understanding’ 
before watching videos 1, 2 and 3. 

4  Results and Analysis 

This section presents the findings of the pilot study. 

4.1  Multimedia Presentation Impact on Participants’ Understanding 

Our grading of the participants’ responses before and after watching the multimedia presentations is 
listed in Table 2. It appears that the participants’ understanding of term 3 was the lowest before they 
watched  the  videos  but  significantly  improved  after  watching  video  3.  With  the  exception  of 
Participant 1, the participants’ understanding of the terms improved after viewing the presentations.

We  also  computed  the  mean  of  the  differences  between  the  ‘After  watching  the  video’  and  ‘Before 
watching the video’ comprehension values for each of the terms (i.e. the average of the ‘After watching 
the video’ value minus the ‘Before watching the video’ value). In this study, we found that participants’ 
comprehension  of  the  three  terms  before  watching  the  videos  was  0.83  with  a  standard  deviation  of 
0.44  and  after  watching  the  videos  was  1.67  with  a  standard  deviation  of  0.53.  The  mean  difference 
value before and after watching videos is 0.85, with a standard deviation of 0.48. 

Each  participants’  ability  to  comprehend  is  depicted  in  Figure  4.  A  positive  value  (>0)  for  ability  to 
comprehend indicates an improved understanding after watching the videos.

4.2  Participants’ Feedback 

Participants were also asked to rate the usefulness of the multimedia presentations in enhancing their 
understanding  of  the  technical  terms  and  concepts.  The  rating  is  presented  in  Figure  5.  Eight 
participants  (88.9%)  gave  a  rating  of  3  or  more,  and  three  of  the  eight  participants  gave  the  highest 
rating of 5.

The participants’ feedback is listed in Table 3. Participant 1, who experienced no improvement in their 
understanding  of  the  terms  and  concepts  after  watching  the  videos,  gave  a  rating  of  1  (the  lowest). 
They  went  on  to  explain  that  the  three  terms  selected  for  the  study  were  ‘basic  concepts’.  Other 
participants (e.g. Participants 5 and 6), however, stated that the videos were useful in enhancing their 
understanding of the materials.

5  Discussion 

It is no longer a question of if malicious cyber activities will negatively affect a business, but of when, 
and  consequently,  the  role  of  digital  forensics  is  now  more  important  than  ever.  It  is,  however, 
challenging for technicians and practitioners to keep  pace with technological advancements (and the 
associated  terminologies  and  concepts).  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  devise  an  effective  means  for 
improving an individual’s understanding of complex digital forensic terms and concepts. 

While the findings in this study, as well as our previous study (Cahyani  et al. 2016), on the ability of 
multimedia presentations to improve an individual’s understanding of complex digital forensic terms 
and concepts have been promising, both pilot studies were limited by their sample size. Therefore, it is 
essential  to  extend  this  research  to  include  participants  from  different  sectors  on  a  wider  scale.  In 
addition,  the  four  components  identified  by  Taylor  et  al.  (2007)  may  be  useful  in  both  the  choice  of 
terms and design of future multimedia presentations: 

Component 1: Multi-disciplinary content and, therefore, a wider range of contents to be covered. In the 
future,  we  will  canvass  the  opinions  of  key  stakeholders  in  digital  forensics  and  incident  response, 
particularly those in law enforcement, academia, the private sector, and the judiciary, to obtain a list of 
key  technical  terms  that  are  common  in  incident  response  and  forensic  investigations,  judicial  or 
administrative proceedings. 

Component 2: Hands-on exercises. Participants had also commented that hands-on exercises might be 
a more effective way of learning. Therefore, in future research, we will also examine the merits of other 
education  platforms.  For  example,  due  to  the  increasingly  popularity  of  mobile  devices,  would  it  be 
possible to leverage mobile learning platforms (Lu and Viehland 2008)? 

Component  3:  Knowledgeable  instructors.  In  our  pilot  studies,  we  did  not  distinguish  between 
beginner,  intermediate  and  advanced  participants.  In  future  research,  we  will  examine  the  need  to 
design materials suited for different participant groups. 

Component 4: Real world case examples. As the terms and concepts used in digital forensics might be 
new  for  some  participants,  the  use  of  analogy  may  help  to  facilitate  participants’  understanding, 
particularly for participants with little or no technical knowledge. 

6  Concluding Remarks 

In  this  pilot  study,  we  examined  the  potential  for  using  multimedia  presentations  to  enhance 
participants’ understanding of technical terms and concepts  in digital forensics.  We found that eight 
out  of  the  nine  participants  (88.9%)  in  this  study  experienced  an  increase  in  their  level  of 
understanding  after  watching  the  multimedia  presentations.  This  suggests  that  multimedia 
presentations are likely to be an effective tool in improving a learner’s understanding of digital forensic 
terminologies.  The  findings  in  this  study  echoed  our  previous  observations  in  a  study  involving 
participants comprising judges, investigators, prosecutors and staff from three provinces in Indonesia 
(Cahyani et al. 2016).
