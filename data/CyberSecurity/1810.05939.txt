Abstract—  State  estimation  estimates  the  system  condition  in 
real-time and provides a base case for other energy management 
system (EMS) applications including real-time contingency anal-
ysis and security-constrained economic dispatch. Recent work in 
the literature shows malicious cyber-attack can inject false meas-
urements that bypass traditional bad data detection in state esti-
mation and cause actual overloads. Thus, it is very important to 
detect such cyber-attack. In this paper, multiple metrics are pro-
posed  to  monitor  abnormal  load  deviations  and  suspicious 
branch  flow  changes.  A  systematic  two-stage  approach  is  pro-
posed to  detect  false  data injection  (FDI) cyber-attack. The first 
stage  determines  whether  the  system  is  under  attack  while  the 
second  stage  identifies  the  target  branch.  Numerical  simulations 
verify  that  FDI  can  cause  severe  system  violations  and  demon-
strate  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  two-stage  FDI  detection 
(FDID)  method.  It  is  concluded  that  the  proposed  FDID  ap-
proach  can  efficiently  detect  FDI  cyber-attack  and  identify  the 
target branch, which will substantially improve operators’ situa-
tion awareness in real-time.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
n  modern  power  systems,  energy  management  systems 
(EMSs) are used to help system operators manage real-time 
operations.  Key  functions  of  EMS  include  state  estimation 
(SE),  real-time  contingency  analysis  (RTCA)  and  real-time 
security-constrained  economic  dispatch  (SCED).  These  func-
tions execute in a coordinated way such that the system relia-
bility can be maintained with least-cost solutions. 

State  estimation  executes  routinely  in  real-time  and  serves 
as  a  core  function  in  EMS  for  monitoring  system  condition. 
For instance,  the SE at PJM, an independent  system operator 
(ISO) in the United States, runs on a one-minute basis and can 
converge  in  30-45  seconds  [1].  With  the  measurement  data 
received  from  remote  terminal  units  (RTU)  or  local  control 
centers  through  a  communication  network,  state  estimation 
can effectively estimate the system status and provide a basis 
for other subsequent applications in real-time. State estimation 
methods are based on the physical relationships of the power 
system and require data redundancy. 

The traditional bad data detection and identification module 
of SE can detect random bad data that are introduced by large 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measurement  errors.  It  ensures  the  impact  of  random  meas-
urement noises on  SE is  minimal.  However, recent  work [2]-
[8]  in the literature shows  that  malicious cyber-attack can in-
ject false measurements that are designed to meet the physical 
laws and bypass bad data detection. This indicates that power 
system state estimation is subject to false data injection (FDI) 
cyber-attack  that  may  lead  to  physical  consequences.  Moreo-
ver, real-world cyber-attack example exists: in 2015, a cyber-
attack against the Ukraine power grid caused a serious physi-
cal blackout event, which is referred to as the first known suc-
cessful power system incident caused by a cyber-attack [9]. 

FDI  cyber-attack  on  power  system  state  estimation  has 
gained significant attention since it was first proposed by Liu 
et al. in [2]: FDI cyber-attack injects coordinated false  meas-
urements  in  an  unobservable  way  such  that  the  SE  solutions 
are  corrupted  and  may  negatively  affect  operators  real-time 
dispatch  decisions.  The  attack  model  proposed  in  [2]  and  its 
impact are further analyzed, and more detailed results are pre-
sented in [3], as well as a generalized FDI cyber-attack model. 
Two  regimes  of  attacks,  a  strong  regime  and  a  weak  regime, 
are presented in [4]. The strong regime attack with access to a 
sufficient  number  of  meters  can  launch  unobservable  attacks 
while the weak regime attack can be detected as only a limited 
number  of  meters  are  under  control  of  the  attacker.  A  graph 
theory based algorithm is proposed in [5] to identify the loca-
tions  where  attackers  can  attack  with  the  least-number  meas-
urements  to  keep  the  attack  from  being  detected  by  AC  state 
estimation.  Thus,  those  locations  may  need  more  protection 
against potential FDI attacks. It is shown in [6] that the attack-
er can launch an unobservable attack by only introducing false 
measurements  within  a  subgraph  that  is  determined  by  the 
subgraph  algorithm  proposed  in  [5].  Extended  on  [6],  a  bi-
level optimization is proposed in [7] to maximize the physical 
flow on a target branch, which is equivalent to maximizing the 
branch  overload.  Though  the  FDI  cyber-attack  approach  pro-
posed in [7] can cause unobservable branch overloads, it does 
not  scale  due  to  computational  complexity.  Therefore,  three 
computationally  efficient  algorithms  are  proposed  in  [8]  to 
speed-up the solution time and provide boundaries on system 
vulnerability. 

As  illustrated  in  [2]-[8],  power  systems  are  subject  to  FDI 
cyber-attack  and  the  attacker  can  invisibly  compromise  SE. 
Thus,  SE  under  FDI  cyber-attack  may  be  corrupted  and  pro-
vide  a  biased  base  case  for  other  EMS  applications,  which 
poses substantial risks on RTCA and SCED. A biased system 
condition  may  mislead  system  operators  to  take  incorrect  ac-
tions  such as  improper generation adjustment,  which  leads to 
severe violations or damage to the power system. Therefore, it 
is critical to ensure the SE results are correct. Developing FDI 
detection  (FDID)  strategies  that  can  efficiently  detect  FDI 
cyber-attack  is  vital  for  reliability  enhancements  and  secure 
operations  of  electric  power  systems.  A  number  of  methods 
have been proposed in the literature to address system vulner-
abilities  due  to  FDI  cyber-attack.  These  methods  can  be 
grouped  into  two  categories  [10]-[11]:  (i)  protection-based 
methods [12]-[19] and (ii) detection-based methods [20]-[25]. 
A  greedy  algorithm  is  proposed  in  [12]  to  select  measure-
ments  considering  a  budget  constraint  such  that  those  meas-
urements  will  be  encrypted  for  protection  to  maximize  the 
system  security.  Reference  [13]  designed  a  fast  greedy  algo-

rithm  to  protect  a  subset  of  measurements  for  defending  FDI 
cyber-attack. Known-secure PMUs are used to defense against 
FDI cyber-attack in [14]-[15], where a scheme is proposed to 
find the minimum number of necessary PMUs. A least-budget 
defense strategy, which can achieve quality solutions in a rea-
sonable  time,  is  proposed  in  [16]  to  enhance  state  estimation 
against FDI cyber-attack by protecting critical meters. In [17], 
a  specific  set  of  measurements  are  selected  and  protected  to 
detect FDI cyber-attack. The smallest set of measurements can 
be  determined  by  the  proposed  two  approaches,  brute-force 
search  and  protecting  basic  measurements.  A  novel  counter-
measure against FDI cyber-attack is proposed in [18] by pro-
tecting critical state variables, which is realized by protecting 
a minimum number of meter measurements; further, graphical 
methods are used to determine the minimum number of neces-
sary  measurements [19]. The work presented in  [12]-[19] are 
protection-based  methods  that  share  two  drawbacks  [11]:  (i) 
data redundancy decreases; and (ii) protection is not absolute-
ly secure. SE can work more effectively with higher degree of 
redundancy;  with  a  subset  of  trusted  measurements  only,  the 
robustness and accuracy of SE solutions will drop. Moreover, 
the  attacker  may  be  able  to  compromise  the  protection  that 
leads to the failure of protection-based methods. 

A  novel  FDID  mechanism  that  uses  nuclear  norm  minimi-
zation and low rank matrix factorization is proposed in [20] to 
separate nominal grid states and the anomalies. The Bayesian 
framework  proposed  in  [21]-[22]  can  preserve  and  trace  pos-
sible  system  states  using  prior  information,  which  can  detect 
false data by identifying statistically unlikely measurements. It 
is shown in [23] that random bad data injection can be identi-
fied  by  state  estimation  while  stealth  bad  data  injection  can 
bypass state estimation; thus, [23] proposes a defense strategy 
against  the  stealth  bad  data  injection  by  conducting  real-time 
statistical analysis on a sequence of data at the minimum cost 
of delay. A three-phase mechanism is proposed in [24] to de-
tect FDI cyber-attack by evaluating spatiotemporal correlation 
between  system  states.  A  centralized  FDI  detector  that  is 
based on the generalized likelihood ratio and a distributed FDI 
detector  that  employs  the  adaptive  level-triggered  sampling 
technique are proposed in [25] to efficiently detect FDI cyber-
attack.  The  above  methods  [20]-[25]  are  classified  as  detec-
tion-based  methods that do not rely on the  protection on pre-
selected key measurements. However, those methods may not 
be able to detect the cyber-attack when the injected false data 
fit the distribution of previous measurements. 

In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  real-time  systematic  two-stage 
detection  approach  against  FDI  cyber-attack,  which  relies  on 
neither key meter protection nor historical data. The proposed 
FDI detection method is based on an alert system with multi-
ple  novel  metrics;  sensitivity  factors  such  as  power  transfer 
distribution factors (PTDF) are used to calculate those devised 
metrics.  With  the  proposed  strategy,  majority  of  the  cyber-
attack  events  can  be  successfully  detected  in  real-time.  The 
contributions of this work are presented as follows: 

(i)  The  proposed  two-stage  FDID  strategy  is  computa-
tionally  tractable.  The  first  stage  determines  whether 
the  system  is  under  FDI  cyber-attack  and  the  second 
stage identifies the target branch. 

(ii)  The proposed metrics and alert system can effectively 

monitor abnormal load deviations and flow changes. 

 
(iii)  The proposed approach can enhance SE by effectively 
detecting  FDI  cyber-attack  in  real-time  and,  thus  im-
prove system cyber-security. The proposed systematic 
FDID scheme  is more robust since it depends on nei-
ther meter protection nor historical data. 

(iv)  Simulation  results  demonstrate  the  proposed  FDID 
scheme  can  efficiently  detect  FDI  cyber-attack  and 
identify  the  target  branch;  the  results  also  show  the 
false alarm rate and false dismissal rate are low. 
The  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  II 
briefly  introduces  state  estimation.  Section  III  explains  FDI 
cyber-attack.  Section  IV  presents  the  proposed  monitoring 
metrics,  FDI  cyber-attack  alert  system  and  systematic  two-
stage FDID approach. Section V presents the numerical results 
for  FDI  and  FDID.  Finally,  Section  VI  concludes  the  paper 
and Section VII presents the future work. 

II.  STATE ESTIMATION 

State estimation processes the data received from  RTUs or 
local  control  centers  and  estimates  the  system  status  in  real-
time. It provides a base case or a starting point for other EMS 
functions such as RTCA and SCED. Thus, state estimation is 
an essential function of EMS as it is the basis for other mod-
ules in EMS. The sequence of power system real-time opera-
tions is illustrated in Fig. 1.

Note  that  the  attacker  cannot  directly  modify  the  state  varia-
ble;  rather,  the  attacker  injects  false  measurements  that  indi-
rectly  leads  to  biased  estimates  of  the  state  variable.  In  addi-
tion, if the attacker targets at a specific state variable, then, all 
the  measurements  related  to  that  state  variable  must  be 
changed accordingly in order to cover such an attack.

Fig.  3  shows  the  time  line  for  illustrating  the  FDI  cyber-
attack.  There  are  two  dispatch  intervals  shown  in  Fig.  3.  In 
this  work, it is assumed the attacker launches the FDI cyber-
 that is before the start of the second period and 
attack at t = 
 is accurate. Due to opera-
the system information at t = 
−
tor’s  generation  re-dispatch,  the  actual  power  flows  will 
change  in  the  second  period.  It  is  assumed  that  the  attacker 
does  not  have  the  capability  of  manipulating  the  generation 
measurements; rather, the attacker can inject false load meas-
urements,  which  is  more  realistic.  Moreover,  the  attacker  is 
assumed to have access to all load measurements, which rep-
resents the worst FDI cyber-attack scenario.

SE  is  run  continuously  in  real-time  to  estimate  the  system 
status including bus voltages and branch flows. The measure-
ment model for SE can be represented by (1). In (1), e denotes 
measurement  error  vector  and  h(x)  describes  the  relationship 
between state variables x and measurements z.

In this work, the DC model is used to illustrate the proposed 
work. For DC state estimation, the relationship between state 
variables x and measurements z is linear and then, h(x) can be 
replaced by Hx,  where H is a constant  measurement  function 
coefficient  matrix.  Thus,  (1)  can  be  replaced  by  (2)  for  DC 
state  estimation.  In  (2),  state  variable  x  denotes  nodal  phase 
angle. This paper focuses on the DC model.

In  [7],  a  bi-level  optimization  model  is  proposed  to  deter-
mine the attack vector and false load vector that can cause the 
most  severe  loading  level  on  a  target  transmission  and  may 
result  in  physical  flow  violation.  To  solve  the  problem  in  a 
timely  manner,  accelerating  methods  for  providing  fast  solu-
tions  to  this  bi-level  model  are  proposed  in  [8].  A  heuristic 
method proposed in [8] is enhanced in this work by consider-
ing the line flow directions and the associated model with B-
power flow formulation is presented below,

As discussed in the previous section, it is critical to ensure 
SE functions as other EMS modules depend on SE  solutions. 
However, prior work in literature shows that FDI cyber-attack 
can compromise SE and cause unobservable branch overloads. 
Fig. 2. illustrates how a cyber-attack compromises the system 
by replacing true measurements with false measurements. 

To  launch  an  unobservable  FDI  cyber-attack,  the  injected

specified  target  branch 
.  The  attack  problems  for  different 
target branches are independent and the case that leads to the 
most severe overload will be considered as the worst case. The 
term sgn(x) in (5) denotes the sign function. Equations (6) and 
(7)  calculate  the  post-attack  physical  and  cyber  branch  flows 
respectively.  Equation  (8)  shows  the  relationship  between 
physical bus angles and cyber bus angles. Equation (9) calcu-
lates the malicious load deviation for each load bus while (10) 
ensures that the load shift is within limits. The summation of 
the absolute change in state variables is restricted by (11)-(13), 
which is equivalent to an

The above model can be further simplified by introducing a

new  variable

model can be represented by (10)-(17). This FDI cyber-attack 
model  is  implemented  to  provide  the  data  required  for  the 
FDID studies in this paper.

A.  FDID Metrics 

Two categories of metrics are proposed in this paper to ef-
fectively  detect  potential  FDI  cyber-attacks.  They  are  the 
branch  overload  risk  index  (BORI)  and  the  malicious  load 
deviation  index  (MLDI).  BORI  monitors  suspicious  changes 
in  branch  flows  and  identifies  potential  overloads,  while 
MLDI  can  recognize  load  change  patterns  and  identify  mali-
cious  load  deviation.  The  proposed  metrics  BORI  and  MLDI 
are  individual  metrics  for  determining  whether  a  specific 
branch  is  the  attack  target.  Based  on  BORI  and  MLDI,  sys-
tematic  metrics  and  methodology  are  proposed,  and  they  are 
presented in Section IV.B. In addition, this paper proposes an 
FDI cyber-attack alert system that has four different alert lev-
els defined as Danger, Warning, Monitor, and Normal. 
Branch Overload Risk Index 

To  execute  an  unobservable  FDI  cyber-attack  that  would 
overload a branch, the attacker can change the  measurements 
including load measurements that are sent to the system opera-
tor. In the cyber world, the attacker can deliberately reduce the 
flow  on  a  congested  line  or  a  heavily  loaded  line  by  shifting 
loads.  This  would  mislead  operators  to  believe  that  there  is 
extra  available  capacity  on  the  target  branch;  then,  operators 
may  re-dispatch  generation  to  take  advantage  of  that  extra 
available  capacity  and  reduce  the  total  cost.  However,  in  the 
real world, there is no such extra available capacity and physi-
cal  overloads  may  occur.  Thus,  based  on  this  type  of  flow 
change  pattern,  a  branch  overload  risk  index  is  proposed  in 
this work to detect FDI cyber-attacks. 

Since attackers may or may not consider the effects of gen-
eration  re-dispatch,  two  similar  but  different  metrics  are  pro-
 that are defined in 
 and 
posed in this  paper:

Malicious Load Deviation Index 

Power transfer distribution factors are widely used in power 
system operational applications. They are essentially sensitivi-
ty factors that measure the incremental change in branch flow 
due to a change in power transferring between a slack bus and 
a  non-slack  bus.  Thus,  given  a  branch  k,  the  loads  that  have 
significant  impacts  on  that  branch  should  be  monitored.  It 
would be unusual if the changes in all the loads that are criti-
cal to branch k contribute to decreasing the flow on branch k. 
Therefore, based on  this  observation,  a  malicious  load  devia-
tion  index  is  proposed  to  detect  potential  FDI  cyber-attacks.

B.  Two-stage FDID Approach 

Metrics  MLDI  and  BORI  presented  in  Section  IV.A  are 
used to detect potential FDI cyber-attack on a specific branch 
rather than to monitor the system as a whole. Thus, a system-
atic  two-stage  FDID  approach,  consisting  of  an  FDI  attack 
awareness  stage  and  a  target  branch  identification  stage,  is 
proposed  in  this  paper  to  detect  FDI  cyber-attack.  The  first 
stage is to determine whether the system is under FDI cyber-
attack and the second stage would identify the target branch. 
Stage 1: FDI Attack Awareness 

MLDI  and  BORI  are  proposed  to  detect  whether  an  FDI 
cyber-attack  is  launched  for  a  specific  branch.  Since  system 
operators have limited information regarding which branch the 
attacker  would  target,  it  is  necessary  to  calculate  the  metrics 
for all branches. However, given that a practical power system 
typically  has  a  large  number  of  branches,  even  random  load 
,  and 
fluctuations  may  cause  large  values  of 
 for a few branches, which may mislead system opera-
tors  to  believe  that  the  load  fluctuation  is  abnormal  and  the 
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘
system  is  under  attack.  Therefore,  a  system-wide  malicious 
load  deviation  index  (SMLDI)  is  proposed  to  resolve  this  is-
sue. SMLDI is defined in the equation shown below,

where  KA  is  a  set  of  ten  branches  that  have  top  ten

𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑃𝑃𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘
 are 
fects on branch k is too small, then the associated 
not used for malicious load deviation recognition and branch k 
will not be included in the set KA. In this work, branches that 
have less than five critical load buses will not be considered as 
a candidate element of set KA.

In  this  stage,  SMLDI  is  used  as  the  metric  to  determine 
whether  the  system  is  under  attack.  Similar  to  the  alert  level 
designed for a target branch, a system-wide FDI cyber-attack 
alert level is defined in Table III. A system would be consid-
ered to be FDI cyber-attack free if the associated alert level is 
marked as Normal or Monitor in the first stage. Only the cases

that have either Warning or Danger alert flags will be sent to 
the second stage for target branch identification. 
Stage 2: Target Branch Identification 

It  is  vital  to  determine  whether  the  system  is  under  mali-
cious FDI cyber-attack in Stage 1. It is also very important to 
identify  the  branch  that  the  attacker  targets  so  that  operators 
can take immediate actions to handle the detected attack.

C.  Enhanced EMS with FDID 

Since the proposed FDI cyber-attack detection is independ-
ent  with existing EMS applications, it can be  considered as a 
separate module that processes measurements in the first place 
before  state  estimation  runs.  The  added  FDID  module  will 
neither change the current EMS structure nor each single EMS 
application. The flowchart shown in Fig. 4 illustrates the pro-
posed FDID method and how it integrates with current power 
system real-time operations. If no FDI cyber-attack events are 
identified,  EMS  will  execute  ordinarily;  otherwise,  special 
protection  schemes  will  be  activated  to  handle  the  identified 
cyber-attack events. For instance, a higher value of the initial 
line flow and/or a lower value of the line capacity can be used 
for  the  attacked  target  line  to  offset  the  impact  of  the  FDI 
cyber-attack since tampered measurements may not be identi-
fied  and  corrected  instantly.  This  paper  focuses  on  the  real-
time situation awareness for system operators, and the special 
protection scheme under FDI cyber-attack that can be consid-
ered as a third stage to the proposed two-stage FDID approach 
is out of the scope of this work.

A.  FDI Results 

To study the effectiveness of the proposed FDI cyber-attack 
model,  numerical  simulations  are  conducted  with  different 
scenarios  including  constant  load  scenarios  and  random  load 
fluctuation scenarios in the first dispatch interval. The effects 
-norm constraint limits on 
of different load shift factors and 
the  physical  consequences  of  an  FDI  cyber-attack  are  ana-
lyzed. After all possible branches are studied, branch 111 and 
branch  118  are  selected  as  the  target  branch  to  illustrate  the 
proposed  work  since  these  two  branches  correspond  to  the 
worst two cyber-attacks that cause the most severe overloads. 

𝑙𝑙1

Fig. 5. Maximum power flow on branch 111 with constant load under FDI 
cyber-attacks with various load shift factors and 
-norm constraint limits. 

𝑙𝑙1

With the assumption that load profile does not change, the 
resulted  power  flows  on  branch  111  and branch  118  at  t  =  0 
with different attack settings are presented in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 
respectively.  The  blue  curve  with  diamond  markers  in  Fig.  5 
corresponds  to  the  FDI  results  with  a  load  shift  factor  of  5% 
and  it  becomes  flat  very  quickly.  The  reason  is  that  the  load 
  increases  to  6  and 
shift  constraint  becomes  binding  when 
-norm  constraint  will  not  affect  the  re-
further  relaxing  the 
𝑁𝑁1
sults. Since the FDI model used in this work is a fast heuristic 
rather than an exact approach, the flows shown in Fig.  5 and 
Fig. 6 do not strictly increase with the load shift factor and the 
-norm  constraint  limit.  However,  with  more  flexible  condi-
tions, attacker can typically cause more severe flow violations. 
𝑙𝑙1
Note  that  the  attacker  is  assumed  to  have  access  to  all  load 
measurements to simulate the worst scenario case. As a result, 
most load measurements, if not all, are altered to maximize the 
 being 5 
impact of the FDI cyber-attack. For instance, with 
and  load  shift  factor  being  10%,  out  of  99  nodal  load  meas-
urements,  94  nodal  load  measurements  are  tampered  to 
achieve the maximum overload on the target branch 118. 

𝑁𝑁1

𝑙𝑙1

In  reality,  loads  fluctuate  all  the  time.  Thus,  it  is  very  im-
portant  to  analyze  the  effects  of  random  load  fluctuations  on 

Fig. 6. Maximum power flow on branch 118 with constant load under FDI 
cyber-attacks with various load shift factors and 
-norm constraint limits. 

𝑙𝑙1

For the FDI simulations conducted in this  section, the ran-
dom  load  fluctuations  follow  the  normal  distribution  of  N(0, 
3%). For each attack simulated, the load profile will be updat-
ed with a different randomly generated load fluctuation vector. 
The results of FDI cyber-attacks with load fluctuation are pre-
sented in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Fig. 7 shows the results of attacks 
targeting branch 111 while Fig. 8 shows the results of attacks 
targeting branch 118. The curves in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 look very 
similar to the corresponding curves in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 respec-
tively.  This  indicates  that  the  impact  of  random  load  fluctua-
tion on FDI cyber-attack is limited. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show that 
an FDI cyber-attack can still  result in a flow violation on the 
target branch even with random load fluctuations. 

B.  FDID Results 
Stage 1: FDI Attack Awareness 

The proposed FDID strategy consists of two stages. Stage 1 
determines  whether  the  system  is  under  an  FDI  cyber-attack 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by analyzing the load profile change pattern. It is important to 
detect the attack and it is also vital to bypass normal random 
load fluctuations. The goal of Stage 1 is to have a low proba-
bility  of  false  alarm  and  a  low  probability  of  false  dismissal. 
Two  sets  of  system  scenarios  with  different  load  deviation 
vectors,  including  FDI  malicious  load  deviation  vectors  and 
random load fluctuation vectors, are tested in this stage. 

The  load  deviation  vector  denotes  the  difference  between 
the loads at the beginning of the second dispatch interval (t = 
0+) and the loads at the beginning of the first dispatch interval. 
The  malicious  load  deviation  vectors  are  obtained  from  the 
160  different  attacks  performed  in  Section  IV.A.  The  normal 
load fluctuation vectors are created with four different normal 
distributions:  N(0,  3%),  N(0,  5%),  N(-1%,  3%),  and  N(1%, 
3%). Twenty independent vectors are generated for each nor-
mal  distribution  and  thus,  the  second  set  of  system  scenarios 
correspond to 80 load fluctuation vectors.

under FDI cyber-attacks.

Monitor.  Moreover,  the  alert  levels  for  most  random  vectors 
are  Normal.  As  for  the  FDI  cyber-attacks,  the  associated 
SMLDI  values  are  all  above  the  Warning  tolerance  and  the 
alert levels for most attacks are Danger. This demonstrates the 
proposed  metric  SMLDI  can  efficiently  detect  FDI  cyber-
attack and would not mistakenly identify a random load fluc-
tuation as an FDI cyber-attack. In other words, the results pre-
sented in Fig. 9 demonstrate the proposed FDID scheme has a 
low false alarm rate as well as a low false dismissal rate. 

The  first  80  system  scenarios  in  Fig.  9  correspond  to  ran-
dom load fluctuations with four different normal distributions. 
They  are  listed  in  the  order  of  N(0,  3%),  N(0,  5%),  N(-1%, 
3%), and N(1%, 3%). Each normal distribution has 20 scenar-
ios.  By  comparing  the  random  load  fluctuations  generated 
with  different  normal  distributions,  it  is  observed  that  the 
mean of load fluctuation does not significantly affect the met-
ric  while  higher  standard  deviations  may  result  in  higher 
SMLDI values. This is consistent with the statistics presented 
in Table VI. This implies that the false alarm rate for the pro-
posed approach would increase as the magnitude of load fluc-
tuation increases. It is worth noting that loads typically do not 
deviate substantially in a short time frame.

The SMLDI values for those 240 scenarios are calculated in 
Stage 1. The results for the 160 FDI malicious load deviation 
vectors  and  the  80  random  load  fluctuation  vectors  are  pre-
sented in Table V and Table VI respectively. The SMLDI val-
ues for random load fluctuations are very small and the aver-
ages  are  close  to  zero.  However,  the  SMLDI  values  with  at-
tack are much bigger and the average values are around 70%. 
This indicates that FDI cyber-attacks are successfully detected 
with  the  proposed  metric  SMLDI  and  random  load  fluctua-
tions can successfully bypass the proposed FDID approach. 

Fig. 9 shows a scatter plot of the SMLDI values for the ran-
dom load fluctuations and FDI cyber-attacks. The blue squares 
correspond  to  the  random  load  fluctuations  while  the  red  tri-
angles correspond to the FDI cyber-attacks. As shown in Fig. 
9, the SMLDI values for random load fluctuations are all be-
low  35%  and  the  associated  alert  levels  are  either  Normal  or

Fig.  10  illustrates  the  SMLDI  values  that  are  associated

load fluctuations that follow N(0, 3%). The red dotted straight 
line  is  the  boundary  between  the  alert  levels  Monitor  and 
Warning.  Those  SMLDI  values  are  well  above  the  Warning 
alert tolerance of 35%, especially for the cases that have more 
flexible attack constraints. It  is very straightforward and effi-
cient  to  identify  whether  the  system  is  under  malicious  FDI 
cyber-attack with the proposed metric SMLDI. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  results  shown  in  Fig.  9  and  Fig.  10  correspond  to  the 
metric SMLDI defined in (26), where the set KA consists of 10 
  values.  In  order  to  further 
branches  that  have  top  ten 
justify  the  proposed  metric,  sensitivity  of  the  metric  perfor-
𝑀𝑀𝐿𝐿𝑃𝑃𝐵𝐵𝑘𝑘
mance  to  the  number  of  branches  in  set  KA  for  calculating 
SMLDI is conducted; Fig. 11 shows the SMLDI values with 8 
branches  while  Fig.  12  shows  the  SMLDI  values  with  12 
branches. It is observed that the results shown in Fig.  11 and 
Fig. 12 closely match the results shown in Fig. 9 and they all 
show there is a clear line cut between FDI cyber-attack scenar-
ios  and  normal  random  load  fluctuation  scenarios.  This  indi-
cates that the proposed metric performance  is  not  very  sensi-
tive to the number of branches for calculating SMLDI. To be 
consistent, for the rest of this paper, KA is defined as a set of 
10 branches that have the highest ten 

 values.

Stage 2: Target Branch Identification 

In the second stage, only the cases that are identified to be 
under  FDI  cyber-attack  will  be  examined.  Thus,  only  those 
160 FDI attack scenarios identified in the first stage are sent to 
the target branch identification routine. 

Table  VII  shows  the  results  of  target  branch  identification 
against  the  FDI  attacks  on  branch  111  with  no  random  load 
fluctuations and a load shift factor of 10% in the attack model. 
 for branch 111 ranks first for nine scenarios 
The metric 
out  of  the  ten  scenarios  and  ranks  second  for  the  remaining 
one  scenario.  There  are  eight  scenarios  for  which  a  branch 
marked as Danger exists; and branch 111 is the only one that 
is marked as Danger for those eight scenarios. Therefore, both 
the  proposed  comprehensive  FDI  attack  index  and  the  pro-
posed  comprehensive  alert  level  successfully  indicate  branch 
111 is the most suspicious target.

Table VIII shows the results of target branch identification 
against  the  FDI  attacks  on  branch  111  with  a  random  load 
fluctuation  that  follows  N(0,  3%)  and  a  load  shift  factor  of 
10%  in  the  attack  model.  The  simulations  corresponding  to 
Table  VII  do  not  involve  random  load  fluctuations  while  the 
simulations for Table VIII do. Thus, the results shown in Ta-
ble  VIII  are  more  realistic.  However,  the  conclusions  drawn 
from Table VIII are consistent with Table VII. This indicates 
that  the  proposed  strategy  is  also  effective  even  when  load 
fluctuation is considered.

Table IX presents the FDID results on various FDI attacks. 
As shown in this table, the target branches are correctly identi-
fied for 96.9% or 155 out of 160 FDI cyber-attacks. The target 
branch is marked as Danger for over 90% of the FDI attacks 
on  branch  118.  The  percentage  of  the  cases  that  the  target 
branch of the FDI attacks on branch 111 is marked as Danger 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is  relatively  low.  The  reason  is  that  the  overloads  on  branch 
111  for  most  FDI  attacks  with  a  load  shift  factor  of  5%  are 
insignificant  and  do  not  reach  the  Warning  alert  threshold. 
However,  the  associated  comprehensive  FDI  attack  index  of 
the target branch 111 ranks first for most cases. For all FDID 
tests on the 160 FDI attacks, the comprehensive attack indices 
of the target branch rank very high and almost all of them rank 
either first or second.

To  validate  the  robustness  of  the  proposed  FDID  metrics 
and approach and show that they can be generalized to differ-
ent  network  configurations  and  different  systems,  this  sub-
section conducts extensive robustness analysis studies. 
IEEE 118-Bus System under Different Configurations 

It is very common that practical power systems experience 
outages including planned outage for component maintenance 
and  unplanned  outage  that  is  also  referred  to  as  contingency 
[26]. This indicates that the network configuration of a practi-
cal  power  system  varies  in  different  time  periods.  Thus,  it  is 
very  important  to  examine  the  proposed  approach  under  dif-
ferent  grid  configurations.  In  this  work,  three  configurations 
denoted  as  CNFRTN-1,  CNFRTN-2,  and  CNFRTN-3  are 
studied  and  they  correspond  to  three  random  single  outages: 

9 

an outage on branch 1, an outage on branch 71, and an outage 
on branch 141 respectively. Normal random load fluctuations 
without  cyber-attack  and  FDI  cyber-attacks  on  the  same 
branch 111 and branch 118 with and without noises are simu-
lated on the  118-bus test system  under those three configura-
tions  respectively.  The  normal  load  fluctuation  scenarios  are 
represented by four sets of ten independent vectors generated 
for four normal distributions respectively: N(0, 3%), N(0, 5%), 
N(-1%, 3%), and N(1%, 3%). The 32 FDI attack vectors corre-
sponds to two target branches under various attack conditions 
  being  5  and  10  respectively,  and  load  shift  factor 
(with 
being 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% respectively). 

The resulted power flows on the target branch 118 under the 
base  case  configuration  and  three  variations  are  illustrated  in 
Fig.  13.  From  this  figure,  we  can  conclude  that  the  network 
configuration  change  does  not  significantly  affect  the  FDI 
cyber-attack results on maximizing the target branch flow. The 
FDID  results  under  different  system  network  configurations 
are shown in Table X. It is observed that the proposed FDID 
method  can  effectively  detect  the  malicious  FDI  cyber-attack 
scenarios and will not mistakenly identify normal random load 
fluctuation scenarios as FDI cyber-attacks; moreover, the pro-
posed FDID approach achieves very similar results under dif-
ferent configurations.

IEEE RTS-96 System 

The  IEEE  RTS-96  system  is  a  commonly  studied  test  sys-
tem that has 73 buses. Two highly loaded branches are select-
ed as the target: branch 62 and branch 99. This work simulated 
a total of 40 FDI cyber-attack scenarios that correspond to the 
two  target  branches  with  and  without  consideration  of  load 
 being 1 
fluctuations under various attack conditions (with 
through 10 respectively, and load shift factor being 10%). The 
40 normal load fluctuation scenarios are created with the same 
procedure  for  the  IEEE  118-bus  system  under  different  con-
figurations. 

𝑁𝑁1

Fig. 14 shows branch overloads in  MW due to FDI cyber-
attack. Ln62c and Ln99c represent the overload on branch 62 

and branch 99 respectively with the assumption that load does 
change  while  Ln62f  and  Ln99f  show  the  overload  when  con-
sidering  load  fluctuation.  The  Ln62c  and  Ln99c  curves  are 
  increases.  As 
non-decreasing  as  the  attack  parameter 
demonstrated by the Ln62f and Ln99f curves, load fluctuations 
may only slightly affect the attack impact.

levels used for the IEEE 118-bus test system can also clearly 
distinct the FDI cyber-attacks and normal load fluctuations on 
this  IEEE  73-bus  system.  All  FDI  cyber-attacks  are  detected 
and target branches are identified for this test system.

test systems and the variations with different configurations of 
the  118-bus  system.  The  proposed  metrics  and  alert  system 
can efficiently detect potential FDI cyber-attacks by monitor-
ing abnormal load deviations and flow changes. Thus, we can 
conclude that the proposed two-stage FDID approach is effec-
tive and robust. One key factor that affects the proposed detec-
tion method is the selection of metric level thresholds. A good 
practice is to train enough datasets including both normal load 
fluctuation vectors and FDI cyber-attack vectors, calculate the 
metric values for both vector sets, and then a cutoff line (met-
ric  tolerance)  can  be  determined  to  clearly  separate  the  two 
types of scenarios. The optimal metric thresholds for different 
systems can be  very similar, which has been demonstrated in 
this work; the same metric tolerances can effectively detect all 
FDI  cyber-attacks  and  filter  out  normal  load  fluctuations  on 
three very different systems: the IEEE RTS-96 73-bus system, 
the IEEE 118-bus system, and the Polish 2383-bus system.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
An FDI cyber-attack model is first introduced in this paper 
to  examine  the  effects  of  FDI  attacks  on  system  reliability. 
Then,  a  two-stage  systematic  approach  that  does  not  rely  on 
meter  protection  or  historical  data  is  proposed  to  detect  FDI 
cyber-attack. The proposed FDI detection method is based on 
an alert system with the devised novel metrics. Two categories 
of  metrics,  MLDI  and  BORI,  are  proposed  in  this  two-stage 
approach to determine whether the change in system condition 
is  abnormal.  MLDI  recognizes  malicious  load  changes  while 
BORI  identifies  suspicious  flow  changes.  Sensitivity  factors 
like  PTDFs  are  used  to  calculate  the  regular  MLDI  and  the 
enhanced MLDI. In the first  stage, the proposed system-wide 
MLDI is used to determine whether the system is under attack. 
If  the  system  is  deemed  to  be  under  attack,  the  second  stage 
will execute and the proposed alert system along with the pro-
posed comprehensive FDI attack index will be used to identify 
the attack target branch. 

Simulation  results  show  that  FDI  cyber-attack  can  cause 
physical  flow  violations  and  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of 
the proposed FDID metrics, FDI cyber-attack alert system and 
two-stage FDID approach. The proposed two-stage FDID ap-
proach successfully detects all FDI cyber-attacks that are sim-
ulated  in  this  work  and  correctly  identifies  the  target  branch 
with a success rate of over 95%. In addition, random load fluc-
tuations would not trigger the alert system. Numerical simula-

Numerical  simulations  are  conducted  on  the  Polish  system 
that  has  2,383  buses  to  further  demonstrate  the  robustness  of 
the  proposed  approach.  Five  highly  loaded  branches  are  se-
lected as the FDI cyber-attack target. Sixteen FDI cyber-attack 
scenarios  are  designed  for  each  target  branch;  they  differ  in

Table  XI  presents  the  FDI  cyber-attack  detection  results. 
The  average  and  median  of  the  proposed  SMLDI  metric  val-
ues  for  80  FDI  cyber-attack  scenarios  are  both  over  70%, 
which is way above the warning alert level 35%; the minimum 
SMLDI  metric  value  is  38%  that  will  also  trigger  the  alert 
system  and  the  associated  FDI  cyber-attack  will  be  sent  to 
Stage 2 for target branch identification. In  Stage 2, the target 
branch are corrected identified for 74 (92.5%) attack scenarios 
when using the comprehensive attack index only; the target for 
54 (67.5%) attack scenarios are marked as DANGER that im-
plies  the  associated  branch  is  highly  likely  to  be  the  target. 
Overall,  the  target  branch  identification  in  the  second  stage 
has a success rate of 97.5%. As for the 80 normal load fluctua-
tion  scenarios,  only  one  single  scenario  with  the  metric 
SMLDI being 36% (slightly above 35%) is mistakenly identi-
fied as a potential FDI cyber-attack.

D.  Discussions 

In  this  case  studies  section,  the  proposed  two-stage  FDID 
strategy  is  demonstrated  with  numerical  simulations  on  three 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tions  show  that  almost  none  of  random  load  fluctuation  sce-
narios is  mistakenly identified as  malicious cyber-attacks.  To 
conclude,  normal  load  fluctuations  will  not  activate  the  pro-
posed  FDI  alert  system  while  the  proposed  two-stage  FDID 
approach can efficiently detect FDI cyber-attack and the target 
branch. In other words, the false alarm rate and false dismissal 
rate for the proposed two-stage FDID approach are low. 

VII.  FUTURE WORK 

Although  this  paper  has  demonstrated  the  performance  of 
the  proposed  metric-based  FDI  cyber-attack  alert  system  and 
the effectiveness of the developed two-stage systematic detec-
tion  approach,  there  are  still  room  for  improvement  to  this 
work. Key future work beyond this paper is to: (i) replace the 
simplified  DC  SE  based  FDI  model  with  an  enhanced  FDI 
model using full AC SE that is consistent with industrial prac-
tice  and  is  more  accurate;  (ii)  add  AC  RTCA  module  in  the 
loop to simulate the entire EMS; (iii) upgrade the current two-
stage  FDID  approach  to  an  enhanced  three-stage  FDID  ap-
proach by adding a third stage for identifying tampered meas-
urements  and  determining  the  associated  special  protection 
schemes.
