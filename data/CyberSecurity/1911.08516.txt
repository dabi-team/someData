Abstract—With the rise of social media, it has become easier
to disseminate fake news faster and cheaper, compared to tradi-
tional news media, such as television and newspapers. Recently
this phenomenon has attracted lot of public attention, because
it is causing signiﬁcant social and ﬁnancial impacts on their
lives and businesses. Fake news are responsible for creating
false, deceptive, misleading, and suspicious information that can
greatly effect the outcome of an event. This paper presents a
synopsis that explains what are fake news with examples and
also discusses some of the current machine learning techniques,
speciﬁcally natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning,
for automatically predicting and detecting fake news. Based on
this synopsis, we recommend that there is a potential of using
NLP and deep learning to improve automatic detection of fake
news, but with the right set of data and features.

Index Terms—Fake news, Automatic fake news detection,
Machine learning, Natural language processing, Deep learning.

I. INTRODUCTION

Fake news is not a new phenomenon, but recently it has
attracted more public attention. The rise of social media,
easier access, and faster and cheaper online dissemination of
fake news compared to other traditional news media, such as
newspapers and television, makes it particularly relevant in
this new age of information.

Conroy et al. [1] divides the approaches to detecting de-
linguistic and network
ception into two major categories,
approach. In the linguistic approach researchers have used:
analysis of n-grams of words (i.e., bag of words); syntax and
semantic analysis of the text; and structural analysis of text
to ﬁnd incoherency between deceptive and truthful messages.
In the network approach researchers have used: knowledge
networks for fact-checking; and social network behavior, such
as using the metadata and telltale behavior of questionable
sources.

There are basically two major techniques manual and auto-
matic detection of fake news. Manual detection is carried out
by experts in the ﬁeld or by crowds (a large number of regular
people acting as fact checkers). Automatic detection relies on
a combination of information retrieval and machine learning
techniques. Manual detection is more reliable but not scalable.
Automatic detection is less reliable but scalable. In this paper
we only discuss automatic detection of fake news.

In the next Sections we explain what are fake news with
examples and present and discuss the current machine learning
techniques for automatically detecting fake news.

II. FAKE NEWS

Before the invention of paper in China, rumors (fake news)
used to spread by word of mouth, and were mostly conﬁned
to a local community. The invention of paper made the
dissemination of news easier. But still it used to take time
for a news to reach/spread the far corners of a state/country.
The emergence of Internet, social media and smart phones
have revolutionized this process, and now almost everyone can
claim that I have news in my pockets. This phenomenon is very
useful in making people more aware and knowledgeable of the
events and their surroundings, but presents new challenges of
sieving fake news from genuine out of this large amount of
information/data in our pockets.

Fake news spread mostly through online media, in the form
of text, images and videos. Fake news are false, and there
purpose is to create deceptions and mislead people, so that it
changes the outcome of an event. The events can be sending
someone to jail, or manipulating the result of elections, etc.
In this paper we only focus on fake news that are in the form
of text. We formally deﬁne fake news as follows.

DEFINITION: Fake news is any text data disseminated
through online media, such as newspapers, websites, social
networks, etc., that creates false, deceptive, misleading, and
suspicious information which can signiﬁcantly effect
the
outcome of an event.

Some recent examples of fake news:

(1) The government of Japan announced that it was banning
the use of microwave ovens in the country by 2020 [2]:
This fake news was originated on a Russian website about
Japan abandoning the use of microwave ovens by 2020.
The complete news was in Russian and when translated
via Google it stated about banning microwave ovens and
prisoning people not fulﬁlling the requirement. It caused panic
in the mind of people. This news was veriﬁed to be fake by
several fact checking web sites, such as by chek4spam.com
shown in Figure 1, as it was published by a satire website
panorama.pub. Fact checking web sites either use experts in
the speciﬁc domain or use crowd sourcing for detecting fake
news. This is an example, showing manual detection of fake
news.

 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) President Trump to ban schools in order to stop school
shootings [3]: After a mass shooting at a school in Florida this
fake news became viral on social media in February 2018.
At the time of shooting, the U.S president Trump offered
number of ideas, such as arming teachers, and raising the
minimum age to purchase gun, but never suggested banning
schools. This news was published on several satire websites
and as a meme 1 on me.me [4] as shown in Figure 2.

(3) Two altar boys put marijuana in the censer-burner of
a Cathedral
in Spain [5]: This fake news went viral on
social media in January 2018 in Spain. More than 2 million
people read the news. As a consequence, they were detained
overnight and released the other day without charge, but were
ﬁred from the Cathedral as altar boys.

(4) Barack Obama attended Columbia University as a
foreign student [6]: This fake news was created in 2012 U.S
presidential elections about Barrack Obama, that he attended
a college in U.S as a foreign student, to demonstrate that
at some point in his life he was not a U.S citizen and is
therefore ineligible to become the president of the United
States.

From the above examples, we can see that these fake news
have three things in common: (1) they became viral on social
media; (2) they were deceptive and misleading; (3) they had
the potential, and to some extent were able, to effect an event,
such as causing panic and outcome of an election, etc.

A. Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning

Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of machine
learning that deals with processing a natural (human) language,
such as English, Spanish, French, and Chinese etc. NLP can
be used for extracting important part of a text and providing
an interpretation for that text. NLP is a hard problem, because
unlike computer languages, natural languages are inherently
ambiguous. There is a strong and natural relation between NLP
and fake news (as deﬁned in Section II) processing.

Deep learning is one of the ﬁelds of machine learning.
It involves learning from several layers. These layers consist
of increasingly meaningful representations of input data. The
depth of the model is the number of layers in the model.
These layers of representations are learned through neural
networks. These networks map the input (such as an image) to
the target (such as cat) during a deep sequence of simple data
transformations (layers). A neural network is parametrized by
its weights. A loss score is used as a feedback signal to adjust
the weights. After several iterations the loss is minimized
and the output is produced which is as close to the target
as possible.

There are some advantages of applying deep learning to

fake news detection such as:

1Ideas, stories, phrases, etc., typically funny in nature, spread by Internet

users, often with slight variations.

• The ability to learn feature representations rather than
manually specifying and extracting features from the
natural language, and can continually improve.

• Easily adapted to a new problem.
• Has shown great strength in processing text, speech and
image, all of them are excessively used in fake news.
Besides some of the advantages listed above, to produce
good results deep learning requires massive data and time for
training.

Due to the natural relation between NLP and fake news, and
strengths of deep learning listed above, recently [7], [8], [9],
[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] there is
an interest in applying these two techniques for detecting fake
news.

III. STATE OF THE ART

Here we discuss some of the previous recent works on
predicting and detecting fake news using machine learning,
speciﬁcally NLP and deep learning.

Kai et al. [20] proposed a technique that exploits rela-
tionship among publishers, news pieces and users to predict
fake news. For modeling this tri-relationship they presented a
new framework TriFN that employs a linear classiﬁer. They
assign each user a credibility score based on the user’s online
behavior. A user with a low credibility score is more likely
to share fake news. Their classiﬁer outperforms the baseline
classiﬁers, such as Decision Tree, NaiveBayes, and Random
Forest etc.

Yang et al. [7] proposed a model for detection of fake
news on social media through classifying news propagation
paths. They capture the global and local variations of user
characteristics to build a time series classiﬁer. They compare
their classiﬁer with a series of baseline fake news detection
classiﬁers, such as SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
etc. Their classiﬁer combines both recurrent and convolutional
neural networks in one, and therefore shows better results than
the other compared classiﬁers in the paper [7].

Volkova et al. [8] presented a technique that classify suspi-
cious posts using linguistic and network features. They build
a neural network model based on state of the art techniques,
such as recurrent and convolutional neural networks. They also
build a logistic regression model for comparison. They got
better results with neural network model compared to logistic
regression.

Siering et al. [21] addressed detecting deception on crowd-
funding platforms. They extract linguistic and content based
features related to the different types of communication on
these platforms. They examine both static and dynamic com-
munications. Dynamic communication is carried out in real-
time, i.e., it is analogous to face-to-face communication, and
static communication is carried out in delayed mode. They also
used different classiﬁers for testing their detection approach
and achieve good results with Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classiﬁer.

Afroz et al. [22] used stylometry to detect deception in
online writing. They selected a large number of (736) different

techniques compared in the paper.

Hamid et al. [11] proposed a technique that use Convolu-
tional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features from a text
and then apply LSTM on these features to capture the temporal
dependency in the entire text. Accuracy achieved during the
experiments carried out in the paper is low.

Borges et al. [19] proposed a technique based on bi-
they combine
directional RNN for stance detection. First,
representations inferred from three different inputs from the
text, including the headline, the ﬁrst two sentences of the news
article, and the entire document. Then, a ﬁnal layer processes
these results and predicts the stance of the news article.

A. Discussion

Table I gives a synopsis of the current works discussed in
Section III that use machine learning techniques for automat-
ically detecting fake news.

Out of the nine works examined, four combine NLP with
deep learning, two use only deep learning, and three use other
classiﬁers for automatic detection of fake news. Accuracy of
detection varies from 38.8% – 96.6%. The most important
factor among these research works that effects their accuracy
is the extraction and selection of features. Other factors are the
type of dataset used for training and the ML method used to
build the model. Less than half (four) of these research works
achieve an accuracy > 90%. This shows that there is a need
to further this research for improving the automatic detection
of fake news.

IV. CONCLUSION

The phenomenon news in my pockets is very useful in
making people aware and knowledgeable of the events and
their surroundings, but also presents new challenges of sieving
fake news from genuine out of this large amount of data
in our pockets. In this paper, we have made an effort to
present a synopsis that ﬁrst explains what are fake news

features. The major type of features included lexical, syn-
tactic, content speciﬁc, grammar and vocabulary complexity,
uncertainty, author’s attributes etc. For classiﬁcation they used
different classiﬁers and achieved good results with the SVM
classiﬁer. The results presented in the paper show that they
were able to detect imitation attacks with 85% accuracy and
obfuscation attacks with 89.5% accuracy.

Hannah et al. [9] used NLP to compare language of real
news with fake news, such as hoaxes and propaganda, to ﬁnd
linguistic characteristics of untrustworthy text. A ratio was
found for each linguistic feature, and refers to how frequently
it appeared in the fake news compared to the real news.
They build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and
compared it with other Maximum Entropy and Naive Bayes
models. LSTM model achieved better results than the other
two.

Ruchansky et al. [10] proposed a model named CSI which
classify an article based on temporal pattern and behavior
of a user activity on the given article. Recurrence Neural
Network (RNN) was used to build the CSI model. Results
presented show CSI achieving a higher accuracy than the other

we recommend that there is a potential of using NLP and

we will explore the use of NLP with other machine learning
techniques, such as neural networks and other classiﬁers, to
automate and improve fake news detection.
