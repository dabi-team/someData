Abstract: STorage as a Service (STaaS) cloud platforms benefits such as getting access 
to data anywhere, anytime, on a wide range of devices made them very popular among 
businesses and individuals. As such forensics investigators are increasingly facing cases 
that  involve  investigation  of  STaaS  platforms.  Therefore,  it  is  essential  for  cyber 
investigators to know how to collect, preserve, and analyse evidences of these platforms. 
In  this  paper,  we  describe  investigation  of  three  STaaS  platforms  namely  SpiderOak, 
JustCloud,  and  pCloud  on  Windows  8.1  and  iOS  8.1.1  devices.  Moreover,  possible 
changes on uploaded and downloaded files metadata on these platforms would be tracked 
and their forensics value would be investigated.

1.   Introduction 

Cloud computing enables businesses and individual to access computing resources such 
as servers and storages on an on-demand basis, where resources can be quickly 
provisioned with minimal efforts and interaction with the service provider (Mell & 
Grance, 2011).  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) broadly 
categorised cloud computing services into three categories: 
1. 

Software  as  a  Service  (SaaS):  When  an  application  is  used  to  access  shared 
infrastructure  of  the  Cloud  Storage  Service  Provider  (CSSP).  A  popular 
example of SaaS is Storage-as-a-Service (STaaS) cloud systems.   
Platform  as  a  Service  (PaaS):  Users  may  deploy  their  own  applications  on  the 
CSSP's infrastructure 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The CSSP provides the underlying computing 
resources for the deployment of software (including Operation System (OS)) by 
the users (Mell & Grance, 2011).

The increasing popularity of STaaS and the potential for such services to be 

criminally exploited have attracted the attention of policing and forensics scholars in 
recent years (Damshenas, Dehghantanha, Mahmoud, & bin Shamsuddin, 2012). Many 
emerging and new platforms are now based on cloud services to operate. As noted by 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (2014), cloud forensics is the 
application of scientific rules, technological exercises and approved methods to rebuild 
past events of crime committed in the cloud computing environment.  

A number of researchers have reported data collection and preservation (A 

Aminnezhad, Dehghantanha, Abdullah, & Damshenas, 2013; Damshenas, 
Dehghantanha, Mahmoud, & Shamsuddin, 2014; F Daryabar & Dehghantanha, 2014; 
Hogben & Dekker, 2012; Hooper, Martini, & Choo, 2013; D Quick, Martini, & Choo, 
2014), cloud malware detection (Damshenas, Dehghantanha, & Mahmoud, 2013; Farid 
Daryabar & Ali Dehghantanha, 2011) analysis and even privacy (Asou Aminnezhad & 
Ali Dehghantanha, 2012; Farid Daryabar, Dehghantanha, Udzir, & Fazlida, 2013; 
Dehghantanha & Franke, 2014) as main challenges during investigation of cloud 
platforms. As explained by Martini and Choo (2014a), "the large number of open 
challenges presented in a report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(2014) demonstrates that, at the time of the research, cloud forensics remains an 
unresolved and somewhat under researched area of enquiry". 

Although a number of STaaS have been examined (see Table 1), researchers 

(K.-K. R. Choo & Smith, 2008; K.-K. R. Choo, 2008) have posited that organized crime 
and cyber criminals are innovative and will constantly seek to “innovate” in order to 
evade the scrutiny and reach of law enforcement, such as using other STaaS to store 
incriminating evidence.

In this research, we study three popular STaaS that have not been examined in 

the literature, namely: SpiderOak, JustCloud, and pCloud.  

Users of SpiderOak, JustCloud and pCloud may download, upload, and access 
their data using web-browser and client application (e.g. mobile app). The SpiderOak 
client application also enables users to create, schedule, and restore backups and share 
files via password-protected links. In addition, the Hive feature of the SpiderOak client 
application allows contents to be synced across all devices linked to the user’s account. 
SpiderOak Zero-knowledge service reportedly encrypts all data stored on their servers. 
Such a service would be attractive to cybercriminals and individual users who want to 

 
 
 
 
ensure that their stored data will not be surrendered to law enforcement agencies by the 
cloud service provider. 

JustCloud allows users to synchronize, create backup, and share files. In file 

synchronization, a folder is created on the user's desktop after JustCloud's client 
application is installed, which enables the user to access data stored on all devices 
where the client application has been installed. 

Users may store, sync, and share their files using pCloud. A unique feature of 

this CSSP is the upload link. User can have files uploaded on their space by those who 
have access to the upload link. This CSSP is also capable of making backup from other 
services including Dropbox, Facebook, Instagram, and Picasa. Table 2 briefly compares 
the features of aforementioned services.

In this paper, we answer the following questions: 

(1)  What artifacts of forensic interest can be recovered from the Random Access 
Memory (RAM) and the Hard Disk (HDD) of a Windows device after using 
SpiderOak, JustCloud, and pCloud services via Internet Explorer (IE), Firefox 
(Fx), and Google Chrome (GC) browsers? 

(2)  What artifacts of forensic interest can be recovered from the RAM and HDD of 

a Windows device after using SpiderOak, JustCloud, and pCloud services via 
the respective client Windows applications? 

(3)  What artifacts of forensic interest can be recovered from the internal memory 

and internal storage of an iPhone device after using SpiderOak, JustCloud, and 
pCloud services via the respective iOS applications? 

(4)  Whether the contents or the metadata of the investigated files change during the 
process of uploading and downloading, and whether the timestamp information 
of the downloaded files is reliable?

Research will be conducted on Windows 8.1 and iOS devices. At the time of 

research, Windows 8.1 is the latest version of Microsoft desktop OS and iOS is one of 
the most popular mobile platforms (Net Applications, 2014a, 2014b). 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe the 

forensic framework used to guide the research and the experiment setup. The findings 
from the analysis of SpiderOak, JustCloud, and pCloud are presented in sections 3, 4, 
and 5 respectively. Finally, the last section concludes this paper. 

2.   Research methodology 

2.1 Cloud forensic framework 

When conducting a forensic investigation, the investigator should adopt best practices 
such as those of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). The ACPO specifies 
four principles for collecting and examining digital evidence (Williams, 2012): 

  Principle 1: Data which may subsequently be relied upon in a court of law 

should not be changed. 

  Principle 2: In the event that a person needs to access the original data, that 
person must be suitably qualified and is able to justify and explain the 
implications of the actions. 

  Principle 3: An appropriate auditing and record-keeping processes should be in 
place which would ensure that an independent third party would be able to 
examine the recorded processes and achieve the same result. 

  Principle 4: The investigating officer needs to ensure that the law and these 

principles are adhered to. 

It is also common practice that a forensic framework be used to guide the 
investigation. In the context of our paper, we adopt the cloud forensic framework 
introduced by Martini and Choo (Martini & Choo, 2012). This is, perhaps, the first 
digital forensic framework designed to conduct both client and server investigations 
of cloud services. The framework has also been validated by the authors using 
ownCloud (Martini & Choo, 2013),  (Martini & Choo, 2014b), (Martini & Choo, 
2014c), and by Thethi and Keane (2014) on EC2 cloud. There are four stages in this 
framework, namely: evidence source identification and preservation, collection, 
examination and analysis, and reporting and presentation for collecting digital 
evidence from the cloud environment. 
1.  Evidence Source Identification, Collection and Preservation. In this phase, 
potential sources of relevant data are identified. Any device capable of 
connecting to STaaS, either via a browser or a client application, is considered a 
potential source of evidence. In this phase, the investigator should also ensure 
that ACPO principles are adhered to, wherever possible. During collection of 
evidence from storage media, particularly media belonging to external parties, 
the investigator should also ensure that relevant laws and regulations are 
followed (Kent, Chevalier, Grance, & Dang, 2006).  
In this research, the .vmem and vmdk files of each virtual machine (VM) were 
collected with extension E0 using AccessData FTK Imager. The former was 
cloned while the VM was running, whereas the latter was duplicated after the 

 
 
 
VM was shut down. The logs of Wireshark, recording communications between 
VMs and the respective STaaS were also acquired at this stage. The MD5 hash 
checksum of collected evidence files were documented. 

2.  Examination and analysis. Information from acquired data is extracted in this 
phase. Methods to circumvent or bypass protection mechanism on the devices 
may be used to examine and analyze information collected and preserved from 
the previous phase (e.g. use of tools to brute-force password-protected data). 
During this phase, findings should also be reviewed with information or 
intelligence drawn from other sources and investigations (e.g. see metadata 
analysis described in Sections 3 to 5; and (D Quick & Choo, 2014) before  a 
conclusion is drawn.  

3.  Presentation. In the last phase, findings are documented for presentation in a 

court of law (Kent et al., 2006).  

2.2 Experiment setup 

2.2.1 Windows 

The Windows-based experiments were implemented on VMs using VMware Player 
6.0.1. The following files with forensic value were collected and examined: 

 

 

.vmem file: A paging file that includes the backup of the VM’s main memory 
(VMware Inc., n.d.). 
.vmdk file: A virtual disk file that stores the contents of the VM’s hard disk 
drive (VMware Inc., n.d.). 

Windows 8.1 Build 9600 along with IE 11.0.9600.16384, Fx 33.0.2, and GC 

38.0.2125.111 m were installed on a VM with 25 GB hard disk and 1 GB memory. In 
this research, 14 files from a dd image file developed by Carrier (2004) were used as the 
dataset (see Table 3). The original dd image file was mounted on the VM using 
OSFMount 1.5.

SpiderOak 5.1.8, JustCloud 1.4.0.28, and pCloud 1.3.2 were respectively installed on 
VM-W10, VM-W11, and VM-W12 and sample files were uploaded and downloaded 
using the respective client applications. 

VM-W10, VM-W11, and VM-W12 were shut down and cloned respectively to 

VM-W13, VM-W14, and VM-W15. They were used for the investigation of data 
remnants after uninstallation of the client applications. On the last nine VMs (i.e. VM-
W15 to VM-W24), the sample files were uploaded and downloaded using the respective 
browsers. On VM-W10, VM-W-11 and VM-W16 to VM-W24, MD5 checksum of the 
downloaded files were recorded and compared with the original ones.  

In all our experiments, we configured the browsers and client applications to 

decline storing the passwords. In additional, prior to cloning each .vmem file, the 
corresponding browser was closed without the user signing out. The base VM was 
configured to create only one .vmdk file, and other VMs were generated by taking 
snapshots of the base .vmdk file. VMware Virtual Disk Manager Utility was used to 
merge the base .vmdk file with the snapshot files in order to make creating of the image 
file using FTK Imager possible. 

2.2.2 iOS 

In the iOS-based experiments, SpiderOak 3.1.1, JustCloud 1.3.11, and pCloud 

1.11.15 apps were installed on an iPhone 5S device with iOS 8.1.1. 

The following files were collected for further analysis on a personal computer 

(PC): 

  Memory (.vmem file) 
  Network logs collected by Wireshark (.PCAP files) 
  Browsers' files 

o  IE: %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache, 
%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\, and 
%LocalAppData%\Packages\windows_ie_ac_001\ 

o  Fx: %LocalAppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[Random Name].default\ 
and %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[Random Name].default\ 

o  GC: %LocalAppData%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default 

  Master File Table (MFT) with $MFT file name and located in %SystemDrive% 
  NTFS log ($LogFile) located in %SystemDrive% 
  Prefetch folder located in %SystemRoot%\Prefetch\ 
  Registry 
  Paging file with pagefile.sys filename in %SystemDrive% 
  Swap file named swapfile.sys in %SystemDrive% 
  Windows events located in %SystemRoot%\System32\winevt\Logs\ 
  Link files 
  Thumbcache files located in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\ 
  Unallocated space 

The above collected files were analysed using following tools: 

  Wireshark 1.12.1 was used to filter network traffic to detect IPs and ports used 

by the respective STaaS web-portal and client application. 

 
 
 
  Autopsy Version 3.1.1 was used to conduct keyword search within E0 files 
linked to VMs' HDDs, and analyze browser cookies, browser histories and 
filtered files of E0 images. 

  ESEDatabaseView v1.23 was used to analyse tables located in IE database. 

More specifically, for IE versions 10 and 11, the browser database is stored in an 
Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) file named WebCacheV01.dat (Malmström & 
Teveldal, 2013). The tables to be examined are contained in the ESE file located 
in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache\.  
  SQLite Manger was used to extract sqlite files of Fx and GC. 
  DCode Date (Wilson, n.d.) was used for converting dates and times from hex, 

epoch, and WebKit formats to human readable format. 

  Thumbcache Viewer 1.0.2.7 was used to extract thumbcache files. 
  FTK Imager was used to analyze other files of interest. 
 

iExplorer was used for mounting and browsing iPhone backups.  

Files from each of the E0 files that containing matching keywords were 

identified and filtered for further analysis – see Table 5.

3.2   Observations: SpiderOak's Application Program 

Network traffics. Communications between the VM and SpiderOak's servers were made 
with IP addresses 38.121.104.79, 38.121.104.89, and 38.121.104.90 on port 443. 
Memory. SpiderOak, the username, the email address, and the password of the created 
the account along with the share ID (with the date and the time of creation), the shared 
URL and its password, the name of the shared folder, the name of the downloaded files, 
the name of the created sync and its folder on the host and on the target device, all were 
obtained from the collected vmem file (see Figure 5 and Figure 6). 

Figure 5. The username and the email address of SpiderOak's account 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6. The password of the created shared URL in VM-W10's vmem file 

Client application files. Client information such as the username, the share ID, 
RoomKey, the name of the shared folder, the name of the downloaded files, the name of 
the created sync and its folder on the host and on the target device as well as the date 
and the time of launched backup and synchronization were seen in 
%AppData%\SpiderOak\spider_###############.log. In the log file, an IP address 
was found which was appeared to be used for broadcasting on ports 21327 and 21328. 
The three first octal were the same as the device's IP address. In the 
oak_###############.log, similar events regarding the application along with the date 
and the time of occurrence were found. In %AppData%\SpiderOak\config.txt, the Hive 
path was observed. Files in %AppData%\SpiderOak\Sync contained the details of 
created syncs including the date and the time of their processing and source and 
destination paths, all, in SQLite format. 
MFT. The sync name, the downloading folder name, and the installation filename were 
identified in the MFT$. 
Registry. Installation filename and its storing path were found in the following keys: 

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows 

NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Store 

  HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-1335463704-3291414260-3134846049-

1001\Software\Microsoft\Windows 
NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Store 

Moreover, SpiderOak's client application created inbound rules on both TCP and 

UDP protocols in Windows Firewall. The related keys' paths are as follow: 

 

 

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\SharedAccess\
Parameters\FirewallPolicy\FirewallRules] 
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAcc
ess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\FirewallRules] 

Prefetch. Installation filename was observed in Prefetch folder. 
Paging file. The installation filename and the name of the downloaded files and their 
storing path were located in pagefile.sys. 
Windows events.  In the Application node, some records linked to the client application 
installation were located. 

 
 
 
Link files. Two lnk files related to SpiderOak were located in 
%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\SpiderOak\. 
Thumbcache. A thumbnail of file1.jpg was located in the Thumbcache folder. 
Unallocated space. The name of the downloaded files, the installation filename, and 
spideroak.exe string were located in the unallocated space. 
Other files. We located some information concerning the downloading folder and the 
name of the downloaded files in 
%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\GatherLogs\SystemIn
dex\SystemIndex.2.gthr and 
%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Caches\{AFBF9F1A-8EE8-4C77-AF34-
C647E37CA0D9}.1.ver0x0000000000000004.db, the Windows Indexing System and 
Windows File Caching respectively. The downloading folder name was also observed 
in NTUSER.DAT and ntuser.dat.LOG1, located in %UserProfile%, and the installation 
filename was observed in %SystemRoot%\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve and 
%SystemRoot%\System32\config\SOFTWARE.LOG2. Also in 
%AppData%\SpiderOak\fs_queue.db, synchronized files with the date and the UTC 
time were identified.  

Spideroak.exe was observed in the following files: 

  %SystemRoot%\System32\config\SYSTEM and SYSTEM.LOG1  
  %SystemRoot%\System32\config\ 
  %SystemRoot%\System32\wdi\LogFiles\WdiContextLog.etl.002

  %UserProfile%\ntuser.dat.LOG2 
  %SystemRoot%\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve.LOG1 
  %SystemRoot%\Installer\24c05.msi 

Based on the collected MD5 checksums, apart from file13.dll, the contents of 

other sample files were preserved by the CSSP. We were not able to restore ADS from 
file13.dll. Metadata of file12.doc such as Authors value remained the same as the 
original file. It was also evident that the Modified value of downloaded files did not 
alter. However, we observed that the values of Created and Accessed fields were 
changed to the date and the time of downloading (see Figure 7).

3.3  Observations: Uninstalling SpiderOak's Application Program 

Memory. Although the uninstall wizard asked for restart, restarting did not occur. Aside 
from the password of the shared URL, the result of memory analysis is similar to that 
reported in Section 3.2 (see Figure 8).

Thumbcache files. JustCloud's icon was located in the thumbcache files. 
Other files. A task named LaunchApp was created in %SystemRoot%\System32\Tasks\ 
and scheduled to run JustCloud.exe /windowlaunch command. We observed the 
installation filename in the following files: 

  %LocalAppData%\IconCache.db 
  %ProgramFiles%\JustCloud\spf.dat 
  %SystemDrive%\$Extend\$UsnJrnl:$J 
  %SystemRoot%\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve and Amcache.hve.LOG1

From our experiments, we determined that JustCloud does not allow the 
uploading of files with an invalid extension and users attempting to do so will be 
presented with an error message – "Failed: The remote server returned an error: (403) 
Forbidden.". Recorded MD5 checksums showed that, the contents of sample files, with 
the exception of file13.dll, were preserved by this CSSP. Similar to the findings 
presented in Section 3.2, we were not able to restore ADS from file13.dll. Metadata of 
file12.doc were not altered. The values of Created, Modified, and Accessed fields were 
changed to the date and the time of downloading. 

4.3   Observations: Uninstalling JustCloud's Application Program 

Memory. With the exception of not able to locate the email address of the account, the 
investigation result of the vmem file was the same as Section 4.2. 

 
 
Client application files. Although the JustCloud folder was removed by the uninstalling 
process, they could be easily recovered using FTK Imager (see Figure 15).

5.2   Observations: pCloud's Application Program 

Network traffics. Communications between the VM and JustCloud's servers were 
established with IP addresses 74.120.8.17, 74.120.8.25, 74.120.8.28, 74.120.8.71, 
74.120.8.74, 74.120.8.98, 74.120.8.139, 74.120.8.153, and 74.120.8.157 on port 443. 
Memory. The email address of the account, the email address of the person who was 
invited to have access to the shared URL, the message of the invitation, and the share 
title were observed in vmem file.  
Client application files. In %LocalAppData%\pCloud\data.db, information regarding 
the synced files were observed. The file was in SQLite format and contained 25 tables 
that described files properties and folder names of synced data. For instance, as depicted 
in Figure 20, the file table contained filenames and their creation and modification date 
and time in Unix-Numeric format. Also in the hashchecksum table, SHA1 hash values 
of synced files were recorded where their values matched with the original files' 
checksum. 

Figure 20. The file table that contains filenames and their creation and modification date 
and time 

By using Autopsy, the invited email and the invitation message were found in the same 
file. We also observed the invited email in data.db-wal located in the same path. 
Registry. pCloud's default storing folder path was located in 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\pCloud\AppPFolders and HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-
21-1335463704-3291414260-3134846049-1001\Software\pCloud\AppPFolders. 
Windows events. In the Application node, records confirming the restore point creation 
and pCloud installation were located. Additionally, in Microsoft-Windows-Shell-
Core%4Operational.evtx a record about pCloud was located. 
Link files. %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start 
Menu\Programs\pCloudSync\pCloud Drive.lnk pointed to pCloud's client application. 
Thumbacache files. pCloud.exe was seen in TileCacheLogo-814531_100.dat 

The Installation filename was observed in MFT$, $LogFile, pagefile.sys, 

Prefetch folder, the unallocated space, and below files:

5.3   Observations: Uninstalling pCloud's Application Program 

Memory. Unlike the two other CSSPs studied, pCloud automatical signing in feature is 
opt-in (i.e. only when a user opts to do so). Hence, no relevant evidence was located in 
the vmem file. 
Client application files. Uninstall process did not remove 
%LocalAppData%\pCloud\data.db and, therefore, we were able to recover information 
mentioned in Section 5.2. 

MFT, NTFS log, paging file, unallocated space, and the below files contained 

references to pcloud.com:

5.5   Observations: Browsing and downloading from pCloud's iOS app 
A file named p.db located in \Apps\pCloud\Library\Application Support contained table 
and data similar to those discussed in Section 5.2. We located file12.doc as one of the 
in 
the 
files 
\App\pCloud\Library\Caches\com.pcloud.pcloud.cache.  Although  the  name  of  the 
located file was different, the MD5 signature indicated that the contents of the file had 
not been changed. The metadata of the file was identical to the original one. The only 
other  sample  file  found  in  the  pCloud's  app  folder  was  file1.jpg,  but  had  a  different 
name  and  MD5  hash.  Due  to  the  lack  of  collected  data,  we  were  not  able  to  draw  a 
conclusion regarding the integrity verification in pCloud's mobile application.

6   Conclusion and Future Work 

In this research, we located and described various artefacts of forensic when SpiderOak, 
JustCloud, and pCloud were used with IE, Fx, and GC browsers, client application, and 
mobile application on Windows machines and iOS devices. The recovered artefacts 
include email addresses, the ID, and the name of the created account and the name of 

 
 
 
 
 
the uploaded and downloaded files. Our findings also suggested that user's credentials 
could be recovered from memory, and the checksums of sample files after being 
downloading from investigated CSSPs remained identical to the original. However, we 
noted that none of the investigated CSSPs could prevent the timestamp and the alternate 
data streams (ADS) of files from being changed. Our findings also indicated that 
metadata of the doc file examined in this study was not altered which could be another 
piece of useful information in forensic investigation. 

Future work would extending our work to examining machines running Linux 

and other less popular operation systems.
