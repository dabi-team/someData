ABSTRACT 

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) public-private Space Asset Supply Chain (SASC) 
currently exhibits significant cybersecurity gaps. It is well-established that data obtained from space 
assets  is  fundamental  to  NATO,  as  they  allow  for  the  facilitation  of  its  missions,  self-defence  and 
effective deterrence of its adversaries. However, it was only in 2019 that NATO issued its first Space 
Policy and subsequently recognized space as an operational domain. 

Any  hostile  cyber  operation,  suspending  control  over  a  space  asset,  severely  impacts  both  NATO 
missions and allied Member States’ national security. This threat is exacerbated by NATO’s mostly 
unregulated cyber SASC. Hence, this thesis answers a twofold research question: a) What are current 
cybersecurity gaps along NATO’s global SASC; and b) How can NATO and its allied Member States 
gain greater control over such gaps to safeguard the supply of NATO mission-critical information? 
An  ontological  field  study  is  carried  out  by  conducting  nineteen  semi-structured  interviews  with 
high-level  representatives  from  relevant  public,  private,  and  academic  organizations.  This  research 
was  undertaken  in  collaboration  with  the  NATO  Cooperative  Cyber  Defence  Centre  of  Excellence 
(CCDCOE) in Tallinn, Estonia. 

This  thesis  concludes  that  current  cybersecurity  gaps  along  NATO’s  SASC  are  caused  by  cyber 
vulnerabilities such as legacy systems or the use of Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology.  
Inadequate cyber SASC management is caused by hindrances such as misaligned classification levels 
and  significant  understaffing.  On  this  basis,  NATO  should  consider  two  major  collaboration 
initiatives: a) Raising awareness throughout the whole of the NATO system, and b) Pushing forward 
the creation of regulation through a standardized security framework on SASC cybersecurity. Doing 
so would enable NATO and its Member States to recognise cyberthreats to mission-critical data early 
on along its cyber SASC, and thus increase transparency, responsibility, and liability.

Chapter 1: Introduction 

1   INTRODUCTION  

When  Sputnik  I,  the  first  artificial  satellite1,  was  launched  in  1957,  space2  became  critical  for  the 
security of international and national infrastructures (Unal, 2019, p. 3). Thirteen years later, NATO 
launched  its  own  first  satellite  into  space  on  20  March  1970,  to  provide  quick  and  secure  strategic 
communication  to  its  allied  Member  States  (MS;  NATO,  2020a).  In  total,  eight  satellites  were 
launched, with the first two satellites PR/CP(70)2 and PR/CP(71)1 being launched in 1970 and 1972 
respectively, and NATO IVA and NATO IVB, the final two satellites, being launched in 1991 and 
1993.  Subsequently,  basing  on  cooperation  with  the  US,  NATO  began  installing  over  20  ground 
communication terminals in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US, 
as  well  as  Denmark,  Greece  and,  Norway,  Portugal,  and  Turkey.  However,  as  most  NATO  MS 
nowadays own their own satellites or invest in other space-based assets, NATO decided in 2005 to 
replace its own satellites with the NATO Satellite Communications3 (SATCOM) Post-2000 (NSP2K) 
programme.  This  allowed  direct  access  to  cooperating  MS’s  space  assets  and  related  services 
(NATO,  2020d;  JAPCC,  2020).  Space  assets  are  defined  as  space-related  systems  collecting 
intelligence4 and  communication,  which  provide  internet5 and  data  for  military  manoeuvres,  ships, 
aircraft,  telecommunication  and  finances  (Unal,  2019,  p.  3).  Information6 retrieved  from  such  MS 
space  assets  is  fundamental  for  conducting  NATO’s  missions.  It  allows  NATO  commanders  and 
decision-making staff to access critical and highly sensitive data, facilitate the protection of NATO 
MS  national  security  as  well  as  properly  implement  NATO  MS  foreign  policies  and  operations 
(Bimfort, 1995, p. 1; Unal, 2019, p. 3).  

Following NATO’s first Space Policy and Recognition of Space as an Operational Domain in 2019, 
NSP2K was replaced in 2020 by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between NATO, France, 
Italy, the UK, and the US, to ensure fifteen more years of critical MS space capacity to NATO. This 
includes  a  wide  range  of  services  under  supervision  of  NATO’s  Communications  and  Information 
Agency  (NCIA),  from  communication,  navigation  and  intelligence  gathering  to  detecting  missile 
launches and tracking forces worldwide. Additionally, the 2020 MOU aims at strengthening NATO’s 

1  Satellite:  Defined  as  “a  device  sent  up  into  space  to  travel  around  the  earth,  used  for  collecting  information  or 
communicating  by  radio,  television,  etc.”  (Cambridge  Dictionary,  2020h);  computer-enabled  objects  in  orbit  “with 
peripherals  and  network  connections”  (Caudill,  2019,  p.  4).  Thereby,  orbit  is  defined  as  “the  curved  path  through  which 
objects in space move around a planet or star” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2020f). 
2 Space:  Defined  as  “the  region  beyond  the  earth's  atmosphere”  (Merriam-Webster,  2020e),  involving  outer  space,  thus 
“the physical universe beyond the earth's atmosphere” (Oxford Lexico, 2020), and aerospace, thus the “space comprising 
the earth's atmosphere and the space beyond” (Merriam-Webster, 2020a). Throughout interviews and literature, those terms 
are used interchangeably. 
3 Satellite Communications (SATCOM): see Chapter 3.2.1. 
4 Intelligence: The product resulting from “the directed collection and processing of information regarding the environment 
and  the  capabilities  and  intentions  of  actors  […]  to  identify  threats  and  offer  opportunities  for  exploitation  by  decision-
makers” (NSO, 2020, p. 9). 
5 Internet: Defined as “the large system of connected computers around the world that allows people to share information 
and communicate with each other” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2020e).  
6 Information:  Harnessed  from  cyber  operations  support  “commanders  […]  while  integrating  with  other  functions,  to 
influence relevant actor perceptions, behaviour, action or inaction and decision making” (NSO, 2020, p. 9).

defence  and  deterrence 7  through  heightened  redundancy,  flexibility,  and  resiliency,  as  well  as 
national expertise.  

Space  assets  consist  of  three  segments:  a  space  (uplink,  satellites),  ground  (downlink,  operational 
ground stations), and data (crosslink) segment (Livingstone & Lewis, 2016, p. 16). This architecture 
is  enabled  by  commercially 8  developed,  market-led  cyber 9  technology,  consisting  of  hardware, 
software  and  further  digital  components.  Thereby,  cyber  and  space  security  are  indivisibly  linked 
(Livingstone  &  Lewis,  2016,  p.  3).  As  stated  by  Paulauskas  “space  is  unique  in  that  it  depends  on 
other domains less than they depend on space with the exception of cyber, which is critical for space 
for data links” (Paulauskas, 2020, p. 8). NATO recognized cyberspace10 as an operational domain in 
2016,  acknowledging  its  inherent  similarities  with  outer  space,  specifically  its  lack  of  geographic 
boundaries.  This  marked  an  operational  shift  to  focus  on  mission11,  and  specifically  information 
assurance12,  and  thus  the  strategic  deconfliction  of  cyberspace.  However,  NATO’s  Standardization 
Office acknowledges that  

“the  assignment  of  classical  operational  boundaries  in  cyberspace  is  particularly  difficult 
[since] is not only in constant flux but even more importantly, it may be used by anyone for 
almost  any  purpose  [it]  is  also  distinct  in  that  its  underlying  physical  elements  are  entirely 
man-made,  which  is  different  from  land,  air  and  space,  and  sea  [and]  may  be  managed 
through manipulation of the domain itself” (NSO, 2020, p. 3). 

Due  to  cyberspace’s  ubiquitous  nature,  low-cost  cyberattack13 methods  and  techniques  can  cause 
asymmetric 14  effects  against  the  technology-dependent  Alliance  or  allied  MS.  This  complicates 
attribution  of  cyberthreat15 actors  behind  attacks,  and  disguises  activities  through  or  in  cyberspace. 
To  mitigate  any  cyber  vulnerability 16  that  may  impact  control  over  space  assets,  reliability  of 

7 Deterrence:  Defined  as  “the  threat  of  force  in  order  to  discourage  an  opponent  from  taking  an  unwelcome  action  […] 
through the threat of retaliation (deterrence by punishment) or by denying the opponent’s war aims (deterrence by denial)” 
(Rühle, 2015, p. 1). 
8 Commercial: Intending to make a profit, thus „the exchange or buying and selling of goods or services on a large scale 
involving transportation from place to place“ (Merriam-Webster, 2020b). Throughout literature, interviews and this thesis, 
the terms ‘commercial’ and ‘private’ sector are used interchangeably. Therefore, the private sector is defined as “the part 
of an economy which is not controlled or owned by the government” (Merriam-Webster, 2020d). 
9 Cyber: Everything “relating to, or involving computers or computer networks“ (Merriam-Webster, 2020). 
10 Cyberspace:  As  defined  within  NATO  AJP-3.20,  is  a  “global  domain  consisting  of  all  interconnected  communication, 
information  technology  and  other  electronic  systems,  networks  and  their  data,  including  those  which  are  separated  or 
independent, which process, store or transmit data […] a computerized environment, artificially constructed and constantly 
under development […] largely globally interconnected” (NSO, 2020, p. 3).  
11 Mission assurance: In this context the “operational impact of activities in or through cyberspace” (NSO, 2020, p. 5). 
12 Information assurance: The “security and defensive posture related to the protection of information and systems” (NSO, 
2020, p. 5) 
13

 Cyberattack:  Defined  as  “disrupting,  disabling,  destroying,  or  maliciously  controlling  a  computing 
environment/infrastructure;  or  destroying  the  integrity  of  the  data  or  stealing  controlled  information“  (CSRC,  2020a); 
“unlike  electronic  attacks,  which  interfere  with  the  transmission  of  RF  signals,  cyberattacks  target  the  data  itself  and  the 
systems that use this data [such as] antennas on satellites and GSs, the landlines that connect GSs to terrestrial networks, 
and the user terminals that connect to satellites are all potential intrusion points for cyberattack” (Harrison et al., 2019). 
14 Asymmetric cyberattacks: Require a “relatively small number or low levels of resources […] by an attacker to cause a 
significantly greater number or higher level of target resources to malfunction or fail” (Radware, 2020). 
15 Cyberthreat:  Defined  as  “any  circumstance  or  event  with  the  potential  to  adversely  impact  organizational  operations 
(including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations […] through an 
information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service” 
(CSRC NIST, 2020). 
16 Cyber vulnerability: Defined as a “weakness which can be exploited by a cyberattack to gain unauthorized access to or 
perform  unauthorized  actions  on  a  computer  system.  Vulnerabilities  can  allow  attackers  to  run  code,  access  a  system's 
memory, install malware, and steal, destroy or modify sensitive data” (UpGuard, 2020).

Chapter 1: Introduction 

information  or  availability 17  of  satellite  bandwidth 18 is  critical  to  protect  the  security  of  NATO 
missions, and national reliance on space asset-gathered information. If hackers19 were to take control 
over space assets, consequences would be dire and cause major international, national, and regional 
security concerns. This may include widespread disruptions or permanent shut-down of space assets, 
denial of access to their services or even attacks on national Critical Infrastructure20 (CI). 

This threat is aggravated by NATO’s mostly unregulated cyber Space Asset Supply Chain (SASC). A 
supply  chain  is  defined  as  the  flow  and  movements  of  goods  and  services  and  related  information 
between customers and suppliers21 in up- and downstream relationships, from the good’s or service’s 
origin to its operation, and final disposal (Pandey et al., 2020, p. 2). NATO’s SASC is composed of a 
broad network of internationally distributed actors from both the public and the commercial sector. 
NATO  and  its  MS  commercially  procure  space  asset  software22,  equipment  and  services,  which 
becomes part of NATO’s overall toolkit on collaborative efforts. The integration of this commercial 
SC  is  not  necessarily  a  risk,  however  its  risen  complexity,  need  for  security  updates  via  remote 
connections  and  a  lack  of  responsibility  for  individual  component  development  make  space  assets 
vulnerable  to  cyberattacks  (Harrison  et  al.,  2019,  p.  40;  Livingstone  &  Lewis,  2016,  p.  4).  Likely 
attack  vectors  would  be,  for  example,  the  interference  with  unencrypted  data  transmission,  or 
attacking  Ground  Station  (GS)  antennas,  satellites  or  user  software,  to  monitor  or  insert  false  or 
corrupted data (Livingstone & Lewis, 2016, p. 18).  

Reliability  on  NATO’s  cyber  SASC  is  additionally  threatened  by  commercial  organizations,  which 
are  “far  less  sensitive  to  security  than  they  are  to  profit”  (Caudill,  2019,  p.  4),  thus  trading  off 
cybersecurity23 measures (Livingstone & Lewis, 2016, p. 25). As market competition on space asset 
availability and sophistication increases, time for development shrinks and less scrutiny and attention 
are paid to an individual component’s SC security. Moreover, the recent national trend to launch low-
cost  space  assets,  including  Commercial  Off-The-Shelf 24  (COTS)  technology,  augments  the 
complexity of space asset ownership, liability and management (Falco, 2018b, p. 5). Up to this point, 
there exists no relevant international law, regulation, agreed mechanism or international organization 
that  conceivably  constitutes  a  regulatory  basis  for  the  cyber  SASC.  Resulting  cyber  vulnerabilities 
undermine  space  asset  capabilities,  confidence  in  mission-critical  data  required  to  reliably  analyse 
strategic stability, and thus NATO credibility and deterrence capability (Unal, 2019, p. 2).  

17  Availability:  means  “making  sure  your  data  is  available  [through]  correct  firewall  settings,  updating  your  system 
regularly, backups of your data, documenting changes” (NASA, 2019). 
18 Bandwidth: Describes the “maximum data transfer rate of a network or internet connection. It measures how much data 
can be sent over a specific connection in a given amount of time” (TechTerms, 2020). 
19 Hacker: “Unauthorized user who attempts to or gains access to an information system“ (CSRC, 2020b).. 
20 Critical Infrastructure: Are “assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital […] that 
their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public 
health or safety, or any combination thereof” (CISA, 2020a). 
21 Supplier: Defined as “a company, person, etc. that provides things that people want or need, especially over a long period 
of time” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2020i). In contrast, a customer, also acquirer/ purchaser, is a company or person “who 
buys goods or a service” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2020g). 
22 Software:  A  set  of  “instructions,  data  or  programs  used  to  operate  computers  and  execute  specific  tasks.  Opposite  of 
hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer” (Akoto, 2020).  
23 Cybersecurity: Defined as “the application of security measures for the protection of communication, information, and 
other  electronic  systems,  and  the  information  that  is  stored,  processed  or  transmitted  in  these  systems  with  respect  to 
confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication and non-repudiation” (NSO, 2020, p. 4). 
24 Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology: “Hardware and software IT products that are ready-made and available 
for purchase by the general public” (NIST, 2020a).

Chapter 1: Introduction 

In  consequence,  the  integrity 25 and  correctness  of  data  retrieved  from  this  cyber  SASC  must  be 
mandated for NATO officials to assure NATO’s ability to operate its missions. Whilst there has been 
much  research  on  the  correlation  of  cyberspace  and  outer  space,  none  has  focused  specifically  on 
such  cybersecurity  vulnerabilities  being  enabled  by  security  flaws  in  the  NATO  SASC  (Bimfort, 
1995; Falco, 2018b, p. 11; Harrison et al., 2019, p. 40; Livingstone & Lewis, 2016, p. 5; NIST, 2020, 
p.  34;  Paulauskas,  2020,  p.  8;  Unal,  2019,  p.  8).  Furthermore,  both  literature  and  NATO 
organizational  publications  leave  unclear  the  patterns  of  security  assurance  and  organizational 
management  of  this  SC.  To  fully  understand  the  challenges  to  integrity  of  mission-critical  data 
retrieved from space assets, it is important to gain a more complete picture of NATO’s cyber SASC.  

1.1  Research Question and Outline  

This  thesis  aims  to  identify  cybersecurity  gaps  along  NATO’s  SASC  in  order  to  help  readers  to 
understand  if  and  how  such  gaps  threaten  the  integrity  and  security  of  NATO’s  missions. 
Additionally,  it  aims  to  develop  policy  recommendations  to  legitimize  and  streamline  this  SC 
between the private and the public sector, and thus to reduce cyber vulnerabilities. The research goal 
is  to  support  the  rise  of  NATO’s  organizational  resilience  against  cyberattacks,  so  that  NATO  can 
better  protect  its  missions  against  adversaries  in  cyberspace.  Derived  from  the  above  introduced 
research problem, the research question guiding this thesis is twofold:  

a) What are current cybersecurity gaps along NATO’s global SASC; and  

b) How can NATO and its allied MS gain greater control over such gaps to safeguard the 

supply of NATO mission-critical information? 

This  thesis  is  outlined  as  follows:  Chapter  1  presents  an  introduction  to  the  research  question  and 
research  methodology;  Chapter  2  discusses  relevant  academic  literature  and  the  consequential 
research  gap.  Subsequently,  Chapter  3  highlights  the  most  actual  use  cases  of  space  assets  for 
NATO,  and  identifies  contract  evolution  whilst  examining  the  division  of  responsibilities  and 
according  mechanisms  through  the  entire  NATO  system.  Chapter  4  presents  crucial  space  asset 
cybersecurity gaps, describes malicious actors and motivations, provides insights into organizational 
negligence and identifies existing regulation. Chapter 5 introduces NATO’s cyber SASC and details 
cyberthreats  and  vulnerabilities.  Chapter  6  suggests  policy  recommendations  to  NATO,  MS  and 
commercial SC partners. For convenience, Chapter 3 to 6 are each concluded by a summary. Finally, 
Chapter  7  outlines  the  main  conclusions  and  identifies  both  limitations  to  the  study  and 
recommendations for further research. 

25 Integrity:  “making  sure  no  bits  were  lost,  making  sure  no  web  address  was  changed,  and  even  making  sure  that 
unauthorized people cannot change your data” (NASA, 2019).

1.2  Research Design and Methodology  
Methodological Approach 
The research design and methodology of this thesis seeks to assess the current state of cooperation 
patterns  along  NATO’s  SASC,  and  how  they  are  susceptible  to  cyber  vulnerabilities.  With  the 
research  focus  outlined  above,  it  becomes  clear  that  the  thesis  positions  itself  in  an  internationally 
connected field. Thus, it aspires not only to investigate changes and dynamics within NATO, but also 
to link these findings to international SC partners across the private and commercial sector. Thereby, 
the  analytical  framework  for  this  analysis  is  based  on  the  overlapping  scientific  fields  of 
cybersecurity,  space  asset  and  SC  research.  These  are  interrelated  both  in  theory  as  well  as  in 
practice,  as  will  be  shown  throughout  the  analysis.  To  succeed  in  this  pursuit,  methodological 
concerns  are  central  to  organise  and  focus  the  analysis.  Adopting  a  structural,  qualitative  data 
perspective,  the  analytical  strategy  is  based  on  a  field  ontology,  to  identify  and  study  current 
collaboration  structures.  The  following  section  elaborates  this  thesis’s  methodological  approach, 
applied  to  illustrate  such  interconnections  whilst  providing  an  explanation  of  the  methods  used  for 
the collection of data as well as research analysis.  

It  is  my  ambition  to  show  how  and  why  NATO  faces  cybersecurity  vulnerabilities  along  its  cyber 
SASC.  However,  as  the  nexus  between  cybersecurity,  space  assets  and  SC  is  so  far  consistently 
under-researched,  I  chose  in-person  interviews  with  high-level  representatives  from  a  balanced 
mixture of most relevant public, private, and academia backgrounds to be able to collect and analyse 
primary data for the purpose of this study. I am confident that this method provides an appropriate 
approach  to  answering  the  problem  statement  and  research  questions,  allowing  to  incorporate  the 
expertise of current and multi-layered insights by well-respected and well-experienced practitioners 
and scholars. Additionally, I complemented this approach by precedingly and continuously analysing 
secondary data within a thorough, academic literature review (see Chapter 2).  

Methods of Qualitative Data Collection 

As outlined above, I decided to conduct a qualitative research study by holding 19 interviews with 
representatives from the following organizations and companies listed below:

Chapter 1: Introduction 

Similar  to  the  selection  of  appropriate  academic  literature,  organizations  and  companies  were 
selected based on  

a) their organizational proximity to NATO along NATO’s SC, such as LuxGovSat or Horizon 
Technologies,  

b) their organizational or managerial functions within NATO itself such as NCIA or JAPCC, 
or  

c) their NATO-significant company working output, for instance legislation considering the 
nexus of SC, cybersecurity and space assets, such as OSA or AIA.  

Interviewees were selected based on the research-significant positions and functions held within the 
respective  organization  or  company.  This  repeatedly  included  positions  such  as  Director,  Vice 
President,  Advisor  or  Strategist  amongst  fields  such  as  Government  Satellite  Communications  (see 
3.1.1), Cyber, Space and National Security or Aerospace Cybersecurity. Whilst 17 interviews were 
conducted with interviewees separately, AIA and LuxGovSat participants decided to collaboratively 
take part in the interviews to complement each other’s knowledge.  

Five major fields determined the interview guidelines and aligned with the research goal of this thesis 
(find the complete interview guideline in the Annex):  

a) General Introduction; 

b) NATO and military use of space;  

c) Space asset cybersecurity;  

d) The nexus between space assets’ cybersecurity and supply chain; and  

e) Policy recommendations.  

However, as interviews were conducted in a semi-structured manner, specific questions based on the 
preceding  literature  research  were  posed  in  response  to  the  general  direction  of  the  interviewee’s 
answers and field-specific knowledge. Due to the ongoing pandemic and geographically widespread 
locations  of  participants,  interviews  were  exclusively  conducted  via  online  video  conferencing 
services  and  lasted  typically  from  one  to  two  hours.  All  interviews  were,  with  the  interviewees’ 
consent,  recorded  to  ease  later  analysis.  Due  to  frequently  sensitive  information,  direct  transcripts 
remain  confidential,  whilst  all  direct  citations  presented  throughout  the  subsequent  analysis  were 
verified and agreed upon by the respective interviewees. 

Qualitative Methods of Analysis 

After following the steps introduced above, the gathered interviews were transcribed. Each field was 
examined  with  the  aim  to  gain  an  understanding  of  the  interviewee’s  perception  and  specific 
knowledge  on  the  cyber  SASC.  Data  was  then  processed  and  analysed  using  content  analysis, 
categorizing,  and  subsequently  discussing  the  meaning  of  phrases,  words,  and  sentences, 
complemented  by  thematic  analysis.  This  approach  was  chosen  to  allow  for  subsequent  close 
examination  of  gathered  data,  identify  common  themes  and  patterns  across  interviews,  and  thus 
deduce relevant cybersecurity gaps and policy recommendations.

Chapter 1: Introduction 

1.3  Theoretical Classification 

Turning to International Relations (IR) theory to support the interpretation and broader generalization 
of  this  study’s  results,  Neoliberal  Institutionalism  stands  out  as  possible  theoretical  framework  put 
forward  by  scholars  like  Joseph  Grieco  (1988),  Robert  Jervis  (1999),  Arthur  Stein  (2008),  and 
Quddus  Snyder  (2013).  By  applying  this  theoretical  framework,  the  importance  of  commercial 
factors  for  the  formation  of  NATO  and  national  MS  foreign  policy  becomes  more  pronounced.  As 
stated  by  Snyder,  classical  Liberal  IR  Theory  assumes  that  actors  seek  to  maximize  their  gain, 
however it ignores systemic competitive pressure at the commercial level, as well as the fear to fall 
behind in the struggle to obtain a relative power upper hand (Stein, 2008, pp. 201–221). In contrast, 
the  neoliberal  institutionalist  approach  follows  the  principal  economic  and  political  role  that 
international institutions place on IR and among states (Grieco, 1988, pp. 485-507). It focuses on the 
lack of cooperation in international political economy, and considers international institutions’ main 
purpose  to  be  a  mediator  and  promote  cooperation  to  resolve  such  global,  political,  and  economic 
issues. 

NATO and its MS showcase how cyber SASC gaps originate from commercial competition, causing 
pressure to maintain relative power, credibility and thus the ability to deter potential adversaries. As 
it  is  my  goal  to  highlight  how  NATO  and  its  MS  may  gain  greater  control  over  such  gaps  to 
safeguard  the  supply  of  NATO  mission-critical  information,  I  aim  to  contextualize  subsequent 
findings  with  the  theoretical  assumptions  of  neoliberal  institutionalism.  However,  as  neoliberal 
institutionalist  theory  has  rarely  been  applied  by  academics  to  the  research  nexus  of  cybersecurity, 
military space assets and SC, there is a significant gap of relevant, up to date scholarship. Therefore, 
this  study  is  conceptualized  as  an  expressively  empirical,  inductive  study,  that  maximizes  its 
implications  for  practical  usage,  whilst  at  the  same  time  deriving  systematic,  transferable  findings 
from field-specific academic literature.

2   LITERATURE REVIEW  

This chapter seeks to provide an overview of recent scholarly research on mission-critical data that is 
threatened  by  cybersecurity  gaps  in  NATO’s  SASC.  It  does  so  by  focusing  on  two  main  thematic 
topics becoming apparent by analysing the current academic debate: 

a) the nexus between cybersecurity and space assets, and  

b) the nexus between cybersecurity and space asset supply chains (SASC).  

To  this  end,  this  chapter  offers  a  first  insight  into  current  SASC  security  challenges,  before 
subsequently identifying the research gap underlying the aspiration for this study. 

2.1  Nexus Cybersecurity – Space Assets 

The main concern of scholars studying the relationship between cybersecurity and space assets is that 
consequences of cyberattacks on space assets could became a vital threat to national security, whilst 
NATO MS become increasingly dependent on such assets (Moon, 2017, pp. 8-10; Paulauskas, 2020, 
pp.  4-7).  Thereby,  scholars  generally  agree  that  three  basic  conditions  allow  for  a  lack  of 
cybersecurity and thus for cyberattacks to unfold: 

The  use  of  COTS-Technology:  As  pointed  out  above,  there  is  considerable  debate  about  increasing 
private and public sector use of COTS hardware and software components (such as for CubeSats, see 
Chapter 4.2.2) to allow for “high quality commercial components [and a] considerable reduction of 
[governmental]  qualification  time  and  costs”  (European  Council,  2018).  These  papers  suggest  that 
such COTS components could be hacked and send malicious commands (Akoto, 2020; Falco, 2018; 
Falco, 2018b; Koch & Golling, 2016; Ziolkowski et al., 2013). Scholars further agree that the wide 
availability  of  COTS  technology  allows  malicious  actors  to  analyse  them  for  vulnerabilities, 
especially  by  exploiting  built-in  open-source 26  technology  to  insert  backdoors 27  and  other 
vulnerabilities into a satellite’s software.  

Attributing and understanding interests of adversaries: According to Tucker (2019), the vast volume 
of data received on a day-to-day basis from space assets makes it difficult to determine if and to what 
extent the assets have been compromised by an adversary. Livingstone & Lewis (2016) suggest that 
this dilemma is further complicated through the fundamental difference between the rapid speed of 
hacker attacks, contrasting the decelerated reaction speed of governments and military entities. This 
enables cyber criminals to corrupt the integrity and accuracy of data, whilst facing a low probability 
of  being  discovered.  Finally,  Waterman  (2019)  suggests  that  in  order  to  understand  the  impact  of 
such attacks and bring up governmental reaction spees, technical and political collaboration must be 
increased and cyber-specific terminology be better explained to the political community. 

26 Open-source technology: Software in which “the source code used to create the program is freely available for the public 
to view, edit, and redistribute” (ESRI, 2020). 
27 Backdoors: Any method “by which authorized and unauthorized users are able to get around normal security measures 
and gain high level user access on a computer system, network, or software application […] to steal data, install additional 
malware, and hijack devices” (Malwarebytes, 2020a) 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 2: Literature review 

Decade-long lifespan of space assets and old software: Several recent papers discuss the decade-long 
duration of governmental space missions, making space assets unique in their lack of physical access 
(Falco, 2018; Koch & Golling, 2016). Once being deployed, operators and builders are unlikely to 
regain  subsequent,  physical  access  to  the  asset  (Caudill,  2019,  p.  10).  Therefore,  there  is  a  vital 
scholarly  debate  on  how  to  bring  commercially  trusted  computing  software  for  defence  and 
aerospace  applications  at  the  speed  of  space  asset  technology  innovations  (Bailey,  2019;  Bratton, 
2020).  Scholars  also  suggest  that  security  problems  unfold  through  the  hindered  supply  of  updated 
and spare parts and through products obsolescence over time, thereby creating outdated, unpatched28 
legacy29 systems.  Furthermore,  there  is  considerable  debate  about  whether  or  not  GS  running  often 
outdated  or  common  operational  computer  systems  facilitate  infiltration  by  hackers  and  allow  the 
denial and disruption of vital information (Tucker, 2019).  

2.2  Nexus Cybersecurity – Space Asset Supply Chain  

Findings  in  the  academic  literature  on  the  relationship  between  cybersecurity  and  space  asset  CS 
suggests that the multiplied involvement of suppliers and manufacturers in delivering mission-critical 
data for NATO opens up numerous cyber intrusion threats (Falco, 2018b; Koch & Golling, 2016): 

Outsourcing  of  day-to-day  operational  management  to  private  companies:  There  is  considerable 
debate  amongst  scholars  about  the  practice  of  outsourcing  day-to-day  management  to  private 
company services, such as software relying on space assets (Akoto, 2020; Falco, 2018b). Due to the 
highly technical nature of satellites, the increased involvement of multiple component manufacturers 
opens up an uncontrollable number of weaknesses to infiltrate the SC system, and subsequently the 
data reaching NATO (Koch & Golling, 2016). In short, scholars generally agree that potential threats 
include the substitution of hardware or software components by counterfeit parts, software vendors 
introducing  security  backdoors,  or  the  execution  of  invisible  changes  during  the  manufacturing  of 
satellite components (Falco, 2018a; Unal, 2019). Scholars also express concern that space assets are 
not owned by the same organizations that manage their infrastructure, thus leaving open the scramble 
for liability if they are attacked (Bailey, 2019; Sachdeva, 2019). This includes little control over the 
specific  technicians  or  software  engineers  assigned  to  the  production  of  a  component,  leaving 
ownership of space assets unclear (Falco, 2018a; Falco, 2018b).  

Lack of internationally binding regulations: A wide range of scholars agree on the fundamental lack 
of cybersecurity standards and regulations along the public-commercial satellite supply chain (Akoto, 
2020; Falco, 2018; Sachdeva, 2019). To this date, there exists no coherent international organization 
regulating  cybersecurity  in  space  implementing  and  cybersecurity  controls  on  the  SASC.  Scholars 
agree  that  the  missing  involvement  of  governments  in  the  commercial  space  sector,  and  in  the 
development  and  regulation  of  cybersecurity  standards  for  space  assets  lead  to  a  lack  of  clarity  on 
who bears responsibility and liability for cyber breaches (Falco, 2018a; Falco, 2018b). Therefore, a 
major  academic  concern  holds  that  this  practice  breeds  complacency  and  hinders  efforts  to  secure 
these systems along the SC. However, recent research shows that current private sector attempts to 
increase structure and regulation of the commercial SASC increase resistance against cyber intrusion 

28 Patch:  A patch  is “a software update compris[ing] code inserted (or patched) into the code of an executable program. 
Typically, a patch is installed into an existing software program [to] Address new security vulnerabilities, Address software 
stability issues, Upgrade the software”  
29 Legacy system: Defined as “outdated computing software and/or hardware that is still in use” (Talend, 2020; see 4.2.3.3); 

10 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 2: Literature review 

on  space  asset  components  (Livingstone  &  Lewis,  2016).  Scholars  agree  that,  as  companies  are 
constantly  seeking  rapid  market  advantage  through  innovation  and  exploitation  of  business 
opportunities,  overregulation  and  rigid  control  of  the  space  market  on  a  national  level  typically 
causes  system  developers  to  seek  ways  to  bypass  official  regulation,  such  as  moving  to  another 
jurisdiction or country. 

Lack  of  appropriate  cyber  SC  risk  concerns:  As  discussed  by  Akoto  (2020),  commercial  market 
forces  pressure  companies  along  the  SASC  into  cutting  costs  and  speeding  up  production  and 
development  at  the  cost  of  suppressing  cybersecurity  concerns.  Thus,  a  major  concern  amongst 
scholars  is  a  SC  security  failure,  due  to  a  lack  of  reporting  of  incidents,  uniform  language, 
streamlined  processes  and  responsiveness  of  suppliers  (Akoto,  2020;  Caudill,  2019;  Falco,  2018; 
Falco, 2018b; Koch & Golling, 2016; Ziolkowski et al., 2013; Yuval, 2019). Furthermore, an implied 
risk includes that the awareness of the need for security is not present in commercial SC’s, and that 
this needs to be overcome by education and the use of security experienced space expertise. This is 
aggravated  by  the  ongoing  Coronavirus  Disease  (COVID)  pandemic:  according  to  Lister  (2020), 
further SC volatilities are exposed within the SASC, such as product shortages or lagging timelines 
because  of  COVID.  Finally,  Vasen  (2020)  cites  significant  understaffing  in  handling  such  SC 
concerns within NATO, slowing down the management of space asset retrieved data. 

2.3  Research Gap and Hypotheses 

This  thesis  aims  to  identify  current  cybersecurity  gaps  along  the  global  cyber  SASC  and  highlight 
policies  which  enable  NATO  and  its  MS  to  gain  greater  control  over  such  gaps  and  safeguard  the 
supply of mission-critical information. As has been shown, contemporary academic debate considers 
both the relationship between space assets, as well as the relationship between cybersecurity and such 
asset SC, to broadly relate to the diminished security of NATO mission-critical data to these fields. 
Whilst there has been much research on the respective nexuses of cyberspace, outer space and SC, 
there  exists  yet  no  specific  academic  literature  and  analysis  on  NATO’s  own  cyber  SASC. 
Additionally,  both  NATO  official  publications  and  academic  literature  leave  the  management  and 
responsibilities throughout NATO’s cyber SASC vague. However, it is key for NATO and its MS to 
fully  understand  integrity  challenges  to  the  mission-critical  data  retrieved  from  its  space  assets  in 
order to secure both the organizational system’s cybersecurity and the physical security of personnel 
on the ground. Hence, this thesis aims to fill this research gap, by providing a broader understanding 
of cooperation challenges along the NATO cyber SASC, and thus lifting this veil of obscurity. Based 
on the above outlined research question and in accordance with the existing literature (see Chapter 
2), the following two hypotheses have been developed: 

(H1)  Cybersecurity  gaps  along  NATO’s  SASC  are  likely  to  originate  from  a)  outsourcing  of  space 
capabilities to private companies, b) the use of outdated software and c) an almost complete 
lack of international laws and regulations. 

(H2)  A  safer  supply  of  NATO  mission-critical  information  is  likely  to  be  ensured  through  the 
establishment  of  a  strict  international  legal  and  operational  framework,  establishing 
transparent development, design, management and ownership of space assets.  

In laying the foundation for verifying or disproving these hypotheses, the subsequent Chapter 3 aims 
to analyse current use cases of space assets for NATO as well as surrounding international regulation 
and contract evolution.

Chapter 3: NATO Use of Space 

3  NATO USE OF SPACE  

3.1  Fields of Use 

Nowadays, NATO’s most advanced technological systems inevitably depend on space assets (Moon, 
2017, p. 8). They grant military commanders a comprehensive picture of the situation on the ground, 
perform surveillance near real-time, and thus allow for a wider range of missions and operations. In 
2016, NATO’s Standardization Office (NSO) issued  an AJP-3.3:  Allied  Joint  Doctrine  for Air  and 
Space Operations, Edition B Version 1, acknowledging that  

“while  NATO  neither  owns  nor  directly  operates  any  spacecraft 30 ,  NATO’s  combined 
command  and  force  structure  depends  on  space-based  capabilities  across  the  spectrum  of 
operations.  Space  situational  awareness31 enables  the  efficient  use  and  protection  of  those 
space-based systems” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-4). 

Thereby,  NATO  uses  space  assets  exclusively  for  Defensive  Space  Control  (DSC),  which  mean 
“passive and active measures [are] precautionary and proactive in order to prevent the adversary from 
disrupting NATO operations in all domains” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-7). The following subchapters aim at 
specifying  the  current  major  use  cases  for  space  assets  by  NATO,  as  identified  throughout  the 
preceding field research. 

3.1.1  Satellite Communications (SATCOM) 

Satellite Communications (SATCOM) are the most important function of space assets for NATO. It 
provides “NATO commanders with the ability to establish or augment telecommunications in remote 
regions  that  may  lack  suitable  terrestrial  infrastructure”  (NSO,  2016,  p.  5-7).  NATO  defines 
SATCOM as  

“instant  global  connection  to  NATO  communication  infrastructure  and  to  the  nations, 
transmission  of  critical  intelligence,  the  ability  to  tie  sensors  to  shooters,  and  establish 
survivable  communications  in  austere  locations  with  limited  or  no  infrastructure  […] 
including governmental, military, civil and commercial SATCOM systems and applications” 
(NSO, 2016, p. 5-7). 

Communication  satellites  used  for  SATCOM  provide  global  broadband  internet,  mobile  services, 
voice  communications,  television  broadcasts,  and  data  transfer  services  for  military,  civil,  and 

30 Spacecraft: defined as “a general term for objects launched into space—e.g., Earth-orbiting satellites and space probes, 
experiment capsules, the orbiting modules of some launch vehicles (e.g., the US space shuttle or the Russian Soyuz), and 
space  stations”  (Encyclopedia  Britannica,  2020).  Throughout  literature,  the  terms  spacecraft  and  satellites  are  used 
interchangeably. 
31 Space  Situational  Awareness  (SSA): defined by NSO as “the requisite current and predictive knowledge of the Space 
environment  and  the  operational  environment  and  their  effect  on  NATO  operations  […]  This  includes  knowledge  about 
space  systems  capabilities,  operational  readiness,  limitations,  as  well  as  environmental  conditions,  events,  threats  and 
activities  (both  current  and  planned)  in,  from,  toward  or  through  Space  […]  a  complement  of  space  support  to  NATO 
operations in order to support all levels of planning, decision making and operation execution across the full spectrum of 
NATO operations in all domains” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-6).

commercial users (US DIA, 2019, p. 7). As stated by Yingst (2020), the military uses SATCOM to 
ensure data integrity and effective communication among warfighters and commanders deployed in 
the air, on the ground or on water. Additionally, Wells and Sielaff point to the growing importance of 
SATCOM for military Beyond Line-of-Sight Communications (Wells & Sielaff, 2020), and thus the 
ability  to  act  beyond  the  boundaries  of  adversaries’  infrastructure  and  borders,  which  restricts 
constant connectivity.  

3.1.2  Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR)  

As stated by NATO’s Standardization Office (NSO), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance 
(ISR)  includes  “monitoring  areas  of  interest  from  space  helps  provide  information  on  adversary 
location, disposition and intent; aids in tracking, targeting, and engaging the adversary; and provides 
a means to assess these actions through tactical battle” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-6). NSO precises that for 
NATO,  “space-based  sensors  may  support:  the  cueing  of  ISR  systems  operating  in  the  JOA  [Joint 
Operations  Area],  damage  assessment,  and  operational  combat  assessment.  It  also  provides 
situational awareness, warning of attack, and feedback” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-6). ISR satellites are key 
enablers  for  evidence-based  decision-making,  countering  false  information 32 ,  recognition  and 
attribution (Vasen, 2020b). 

Furthermore, US DIA states that “ISR satellites provide remote sensing data, which include data on 
the  Earth’s  land,  sea,  and  atmosphere  [and]  support  a  variety  of  military  activities  by  providing 
signals intelligence […] battle damage assessments, and military force disposition” (US DIA, 2019, 
p. 7). ISR satellites allow for Terrestrial and Space Environmental Monitoring to contribute “data on 
meteorological, oceanographic and space environmental factors that might affect military operations 
[through] forecasts, alerts, and warnings” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-6). This is done so to “provide joint force 
planners33 with  current,  multi-spectral  information  on  subsurface,  surface,  and  air  conditions  (e.g., 
traffic  capability,  beach  conditions,  vegetation,  and  land  use)  […  and]  to  avoid  adverse 
environmental conditions while taking advantage of other conditions to enhance operations” (NSO, 
2016, p. 5-6). Thus, ISR is critical for both the military and civilian side and forms the operational 
backbone of the military.  

3.1.3  Positioning, Navigation & Timing (PNT) 

Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) is defined as “data that enable civilian, commercial, and 
military users to determine their precise location and local time” (US DIA, 2019, p. 7). For NATO, it 
is 

“vital  to  military  operations  and  a  key  enabler  for  a  host  of  mission  types,  Command, 
Control, Information and weapon systems and platforms. The provision of accurate location 
and time of reference is a prerequisite for synchronized, precise, network enabled operations 
in all domains” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-7).  

32 Misinformation:  defined as “false or inaccurate information, especially that which is deliberately intended to deceive“ 
(Cambridge Dictionary, 2020c).  
33 Space Force Enhancement: defined by NSO as “the exploitation of space based products and services that contribute to 
maximizing the effectiveness of military operations in all domains” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-6). 

13 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 3: NATO Use of Space 

This includes enabling the movement of heavy equipment across land, air or sea using the US space 
asset-enabled Global Positioning System34 (GPS) or other navigation systems such as the European 
Union’s  (EU)  Galileo 35  or  European  Geostationary  Navigation  Overlay  Service  (EGNOS) 36 
navigational systems, at any time. Thus, navigation satellites used by the military are vital for NATO 
communications and transportation networks, especially when navigating in maritime areas without 
terrestrial orientation (Yingst, 2020).  

3.1.4  Deterrence 

Following the field research conducted for this thesis, one further reason for NATO activity in space 
is  the  signalling  of  capability  to  deter.  Paulauskas  points  out  that  NATO  aims  at  a  360-degree 
approach to deterrence “to respond to any threats from wherever they arise […] And space is as 360-
degree as it gets” (Paulauskas, 2020, p.7).  

On the whole, NATO’s MS currently control over fifty percent of active space assets globally, giving 
it  an  unprecedented  advantage  in  past  and  present  operations.  However,  therefore,  NATO  relies 
heavily upon those capacities, making them a significant vulnerability to the Alliance. This threatens 
NATO’s ability to counter or deter aggression (Paulauskas, 2020, p. 9): if an adversary conducts a 
major surprise attack on NATO space assets, reliability and credibility of NATO operations will be 
undermined and hence may be precursor to a major global conflict. As stated by the United Nations 
Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), the 

“growing  dependence  on  space-based  platforms  and  the  increasing  strategic  value  of  outer 
space  raises  the  likelihood  that  a  terrestrial  conflict  could  spill  over  into  an  already  fragile 
space environment, with potentially devastating consequences” (UNOOSA, 2017, pp. 2-3). 

Furthermore, NATO Secretary General (SG) Jens Stoltenberg warns that “some nations – including 
Russia  and  China –  are  developing  anti-satellite  systems  which  could  blind,  disable  or  shoot  down 
satellites” (Posaner, 2020). Thereby, US DIA states that  

“while China and Russia are developing counterspace weapons systems, they are promoting 
agreements at the United Nations that limit weaponization of space. Their proposals do not 
address  many  space  warfare  capabilities,  and  they  lack  verification  mechanisms,  which 
provides room for China and Russia to continue to develop counterspace weapons” (US DIA, 
2019, p. 7). 

The  space-related  military  programmes  of  these  countries  led  to  a  worrisome  trend  of  an  ongoing 
arms-race and weaponization of space (Baram & Wechsler, 2020, p. 1). Russia has already reportedly 
jammed  GPS signals  during  NATO  exercises,  where troops  majorly  rely  on  GPS  as  a  navigational 
tool,  whilst  both  North  Korea  and  Iran  developed  indigenous  space  asset  and  launch  capabilities. 
Meanwhile,  India  tested  its  first  anti-satellite  (ASAT)  weapons  in  March  2019,  showing  the 

34 Global  Positioning  System  (GPS):  GPS  is  a  “US-owned  utility  that  provides  users  with  positioning,  navigation,  and 
timing  (PNT)  services  […]  The  US  Air  Force  develops,  maintains,  and  operates  the  space  and  control  segments”  (GPS, 
2020). 
35  Galileo:  Europe’s  Global  Navigation  Satellite  System  (GNSS),  thus  providing  improved  “positioning  and  timing 
information with significant positive implications for many European services and users” (GSA, 2011a). 
36 European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS): Europe's “regional satellite-based augmentation system 
(SBAS)  that  is  used  to  improve  the  performance  of  global  GNSSs,  such  as  GPS  and  Galileo.  It  has  been  deployed  to 
provide safety of life navigation services to aviation, maritime and land-based users over most of Europe” (GSA, 2011b).

magnitude of this arms race. In July 2020, the US blamed Russia for getting too close to its satellites. 
In response, France and the US established specific space commands in 2019 through the Armée de 
l'Air et de l’Espace Française and the US Space Force (USSF), respectively. 

3.2  Contract Evolution 

To ensure access to services of allied MS’s space assets, NATO developed a series of key contracts 
over the past decades. The following subsections will outline those specific contracts, with acquired 
space asset capabilities being concluded in 3.2.6: Overview. 

3.2.1  1966: SATCOM 1 

In 1966, aligned with the development of the UN Outer Space Treaty, NATO began to investigate a 
potential  cooperation  with  the  US  for  the  development  of  a  SATCOM-cooperation  programme 
(NATO, 2020a, p. 1). For missions, NATO stated that it required “availability and access assurance 
[as well as] anti-jamming features and [cybersecurity] hardening [which] lead to the use of Military-
specific  SATCOM  (MILSATCOM)”  (Plachecki,  2015,  p.  4).  In  1967,  the  SATCOM  project  was 
born,  allowing  NATO  to  install  and  operate  two  space  asset  Ground  Segments  (GS)  for 
communication with a US satellite. A GS consists of  

“all  the  ground-based  elements  of  a  spacecraft  system  used  by  operators  and  support 
personnel, as opposed to the space segment and user segment [including] Ground (or Earth) 
stations,  which  provide  radio  interfaces  with  spacecraft;  Mission  control  (or  operations) 
centres,  from  which  spacecraft  are  managed;  Ground  networks,  which  connect  the  other 
ground  elements  to  one  another;  Remote  terminals,  used  by  support  personnel;  Spacecraft 
integration and test facilities; [and] Launch facilities” (Elbert, 2014, p. 141). 

Initially  seven  countries  signed  a  MOU  which  sponsored  this  programme:  Belgium,  Canada, 
Germany,  Italy,  the  Netherlands,  the  UK  and  the  US.  Furthermore,  Denmark,  Greece,  Norway, 
Portugal  and  Turkey  participated  in  installing  these  GS.  In  total,  eight  SATCOM  satellites  were 
launched, with the first two satellites PR/CP(70)2 and PR/CP(71)1 respectively launched in 1970 and 
1972,  and  NATO  IVA  and  NATO  IVB,  the  final  two  satellites,  launched  in  1991  and  1993.  Those 
NATO-owned satellites were provided until 2004 (Plachecki, 2015, p. 4). 

3.2.2  2005: NSP2K 

Between  2005  and  2019,  a  new  programme  -  NATO  SATCOM  Post-2000  (NSP2K)  -  replaced 
SATCOM1, expressing the paradigm shift that “space segment capabilities [are] no longer NATO-
owned and operated but provided through national MILSATCOM capabilities” (Plachecki, 2015, p. 
5).  Whilst  replacing  “the  two  NATO-owned  and  -operated  NATO  IV  communications  satellites, 
which  stopped  their  operational  services  in  2007  and  2010”  (NATO,  2011),  NSP2K  enables 
additional  and  updated  capability  access  to  MS  SATCOM  assets  “which  is  important  as  NATO 
forces  take  on  expeditionary  missions  far  beyond  the  Alliance’s  traditional  area  of  operations” 
(NATO, 2011). The SATCOM Capability Package CP5A0030 underlying NSP2K was approved as a 
MOU in 2001 between  

a)  France,  providing  its  SATCOM  system  SYRACUSE:  Système  de  radiocommunication 

utilisant un satellite;  

15 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 3: NATO Use of Space 

b)  the UK, providing Skynet; and  

c)  Italy, providing SICRAL: Sistema Italiano per Comunicazioni Riservate ed Allarmi.  

NATO itself maintains seven terrestrial SATCOM GS (SGS), being currently reduced to four SGS 
(Conti,  2020).  Furthermore,  several  projects  for  transportable,  deployable  SGS's  have  been 
implemented,  working  as  an  interface  between  the  SGS's  left.  Those  “terrestrial  SATCOM  anchor 
stations, transportable [mobile] space asset ground terminals and equipment” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-4) are 
managed  by  two  single  NATO  signal 37  battalions  (Vasen,  2020b).  However,  CP5A0030  allows 
NATO commanders to add complementary, crucial access to military Ultra-High Frequency38 (UHF) 
band  and  Super  High  Frequency39 (SHF;  X-Band)  band  (NATO,  2011).  The  overall  cooperation 
between emerging NATO and MS requirements is managed by NATO’s Joint Program Management 
Office (JPMO) in Paris, France. 

3.2.3  2016: NATO - Luxembourg Cooperation Agreement  

In April 2016, NATO began cooperation with the Luxembourg government on its provision of SHF 
and  commercial  Ku-Band 40  as  a  Contribution-in-Kind 41 (CIK).  This  service  allows  for  enhanced 
Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS; Plachecki, 2015, p. 4), which is the 

“protection of ground troops and civilian populations, border control and maritime safety, the 
fight  against  terrorism,  crisis  management  and  humanitarian  assistance  in  natural  disasters 
[by]  giv[ing]  commanders  a  comprehensive  picture  of  the  situation  on  the  ground” 
(GOVSAT, 2016). 

Therefore, NATO’s Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) cooperates with the company 
LuxGovSat  in  “a  public-private  joint  venture  between  the  Luxembourg  government  and  SES,  the 
world-leading  satellite  operator  […]  dedicated  entirely  to  governmental  and  institutional  users” 

37  NATO  Signal  Battalions:  Provide  „communications  and  information  systems  facilities  and  services  to  all  NATO 
deployed  Headquarters  […]  sets  up  transmission  media  by  establishing,  operating,  and  maintaining  two  independent 
Command and Control and Technical Control Centers (C2TCC) […] to administer the deployed LAN and provides support 
and  maintenance  services  up  to  field  level;  provides  support  to  testing  of  new  Deployable  communication  equipment  in 
support of any operation or exercise within NATO’s area of responsibility” (NATO NCISG, 2020). 
38  Ultra-High  Frequency  Band  (UHF):  Designation  by  the  International  Telecommunication  Union  (ITU)  for  radio 
frequencies  (RF)  in  the  range  between  300  megahertz  (MHz)  and  3  gigahertz  (GHz);  “besides  their  use  in  television 
broadcasting,  UHF  waves  are  utilized  in  ship  and  aircraft  navigation  systems  and  for  certain  types  of  police 
communications  [as  well  as]  radio  communications  between  spacecraft  and  Earth-based  tracking  stations”  (Britannica, 
2013). Frequency is “in physics, the number of waves that pass a fixed point in unit time; also, the number of cycles or 
vibrations undergone during one unit of time by a body in periodic motion (in physics, motion repeated in equal intervals of 
time)”  (Britannica,  2020),  whilst  wavelength  describes  the  “distance  between  corresponding  points  of  two  consecutive 
waves. “Corresponding points” refers to two points or particles in the same phase—i.e., points that have completed identical 
fractions of their periodic motion” (Britannica, 2020b). 
39 Super High Frequency Band (SHF, X-Band): ITU designation for RF band from 3 and 30 GHz; “given their ability to 
carry  enormous  amounts  of  data,  super  high  frequency  waves  are  used  for  relaying  broadcast  programs,  radar  (weather, 
etc.), SATCOM and satellite broadcasting, and other applications” (DKK, 2001). 
40 Ku-Band: ITU designation for microwave frequencies from 12 to 18 GHz. Thereby, “radio waves have wavelengths of 1 
m [meter] up. [ [in contrast,] microwaves have wavelengths of 1 mm (millimeter) to 1 m” (Mathsisfun, 2020).  
41 Contribution-in-Kind (CIK): Divided between direct and indirect: “Indirect – or national – contributions are the largest 
and come, for instance, when a member volunteers equipment or troops to a military operation and bears the costs of the 
decision to do so. Direct contributions are made to finance requirements of the Alliance that serve the interests of all 30 
members - and are not the responsibility of any single member - such as NATO-wide air defence or command and control 
systems” (NATO, 2020b). 

16 

 
 
 
Chapter 3: NATO Use of Space 

(GOVSAT, 2019). In addition, the Luxembourg government provides secured management of such 
commercial MILSATCOM Ku-band capacities and SHF (X-band) through LuxGovSat. 

3.2.4  2019: NATO Space Policy  

NATO did not have any specific space policy, mandate, or concept until 2019 (Paulauskas, 2020, pp. 
5-7). The need for a NATO Policy on Space, was firstly officially recognized at the 2018 Brussels 
Summit, being acknowledged as “a highly dynamic and rapidly evolving area, which is essential for 
the Alliance's security” (NATO, 2020d). Driving reasons for the establishment of the policy included 
(Hill, 2020): 

-  The  upcoming  termination  of  NSP2K,  hence  the  need  for  a  policy  lead  to  provide  legal 

support to the use of space asset capabilities;  

- 

Increasing adversarial activity in space, with NATO lagging behind due to legal framework 
challenges in aligning MS positions; 42 

- 

Increasing dependence on NATO’s cyber and space infrastructure for operations; 

-  The rise of sensible ISR exchange within NATO for better imagery and data analysis through 
a newly set up NATO Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (JISR) division. 

Subsequently, at NATO’s June 2019 meeting of Defence Ministers, NATO’s first Space Policy was 
adopted, serving to provide an overarching approach to Space for NATO. Subsequently, in December 
2019, NATO separately recognized Space as an Operational Domain, alongside air, land, sea and 
cyberspace.  Heren  points  out  that  these  new  policies  are  a  pathway  to  reduce  inutile  replication 
through MS individually providing data, underlines the need for international collaboration on space 
security, facilitates administrative processes, and thus more rapidly the provision of operational data 
(Heren, 2020).  

3.2.5  2020: MOU NATO, UK, US, France, and Italy 

Currently, most of the space asset support for NATO missions is provided by the US, France, UK, 
Italy, and Germany (Vasen, 2020b). Thereby, the national or commercial company owning a space 
asset voluntarily determines the extent of its support to NATO. A more binding MOU was set up in 
2019  between  NATO,  the  US,  UK,  France,  and  Italy,  affirming  Capability  Package  CP9A0130 
(NCIA,  2020,  p.  B-1).  CP9A0130  will  provide  NATO  with  fifteen  more  years  of  SHF,  UHF  and 
Extremely  High  Frequency 43  (EHF)  band  (Plachecki,  2015,  p.  4;  Space  Intel  Report,  2018). 
CP9A0130 considers 

-  Future  SATCOM  requirements,  including  protected  core  capabilities  such  as  higher 
bandwidth and smaller GS, EHF for highly protected communication and increased coverage 
flexibility,  increased  tactical  use  of  UHF  SATCOM,  enhanced  flexibility  of  capacity 
extension  through  pre-arranged  contracts  and  nationally  leased  capabilities  and  services 
(Plachecki, 2015, p. 9); as well as  

42 Key question: ‘Where does outer space begin and why nations have to go to space?’ (Hill, 2020). 
43Extremely  High  Frequency  Band  (EHF):  ITU  designation  for  RF  band  from  30  to  300  GHz;  used  for  more  reliable 
communications:  higher  survivability  under  physical  attack,  minimized  susceptibility  to  adversary  eavesdropping  and 
jamming (see 4.2.3.1), “intersatellite communication and satellite radio navigation” (Britannica, 2020a). 

17 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 3: NATO Use of Space 

-  Future  Ground  Requirements,  including  new  deployable  and  transportable,  multi-band 
capable GS, additional remote control and modem44 capabilities, new broadcast45 capability, 
higher data rate, enhanced control and access of UHF capability as well as easier acquisition 
from commercial suppliers (Plachecki, 2015, p. 10). 

As  stated  by  Widmann  and  Vasen,  this  MOU  is  intended  for  peacetime  and  to  ensure  support  for 
ongoing NATO operations; if NATO should have to act as a defence alliance in conflict, each NATO 
MS  is  equally  expected  to  provide  space  asset  services,  to  allow  for  heightened  redundancy  and 
frequency  bandwidth  and  thus  better  operational  outcome  and  force  protection  (Vasen,  2020b; 
Widmann, 2020). 

3.2.6  Overview 

In  conclusion,  NATO  currently  has  access  to  four  different  types  of  space  asset-enabled  frequency 
bands.  Table  ii  summarizes  these  capabilities,  as  well  as  their  most  prominent  use  cases  and  those 
country-respective space assets from which services are obtained. All entries are based on currently 
available public information.

3.3  Division of Responsibilities and Mechanisms  

Globally, responsibilities for the use of MS space asset related services as well as NATO-owned GS 
are  divided  between  NATO  and  NATO-affiliated  authorities,  as  well  as  the  MS  themselves.  The 
subsequent subsections aim to define and divide the mechanisms underlying those responsibilities. 

3.3.1  NATO and NATO-Affiliated Divisions 

This  subchapter  outlines  the  concrete  responsibilities  between  NATO  as  well  as  NATO-affiliated 
divisions. A graphic overview is provided in 3.4: Overview. 

3.3.1.1  SATCOM: NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) 

As stated by NSO, NATO exercises operational control (OPCON) over its organic SATCOM units 
and  capabilities  (see  3.2.2).  Thereby,  NCIA  manages  NATO’s  SATCOM  network  monitoring, 
service allocation, and telecommunications. It is also responsible for providing Command, Control46, 
Communications, and Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), working 
on  both  ground  and  wireless  communication  to  ensure  compatibility  (NSO,  2016,  p.  5-4;  Heren, 
2020).  It  is  responsible  for  procurement,  partial  operation  of  equipment,  maintenance  of  services 
throughout  missions,  or  identification  of  such  gaps  through  NATO’s  Defence  Planning  Process47 
(NDPP).  NDPP  is  NATO’s  “primary  means  to  identify  and  prioritise  the  capabilities  required  for 
full-spectrum operations, and to promote their development and delivery” (NATO, 2020, p. 2).  

JPMO  reports  to  NCIA  (Plachecki,  2015,  p.  7).  It  manages  the  overall  SATCOM  cooperation 
between NATO and MS. Requirements for NATO's Allied Command Operations (ACO), which are 
responsible  for  the  determination  of  the  minimum  needed  military  and  operation  capability 
requirements, are planned together with NCIA, being then discussed with JPMO to ensure that space 
asset  capacity  is  suitable  and  available.  NCIA  liaises  with  the  co-located  NATO  Mission  Access 
Centre  (NMAC),  which  is  manned  by  national  contractors  as  Point  of  Contact  (POC)  between 
national  space  asset  control  centres  and  operators  of  NATO.  Thus,  NCIA  ensures  availability  of 
commercial  SATCOM  services  throughout  different  MS  (Vasen,  2020b).  As  the  security  of  space 
assets  and  their  architecture  is  responsibility  of  the  MS,  NCIA  cares  mostly  for  data  encryption48, 
verification and secure transmission. 

46 Command and Control (C2): In military terms describes “the exercise of authority by a properly designated commander 
over assigned and attached forces, performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities 
and procedures” (NATO C2COE, 2020). In contrast, in IT terms, a Command-and-Control (C&C) server is a “computer 
controlled  by  an  attacker  or  cybercriminal  which  is  used  to  send  commands  to  systems  compromised  by  malware  and 
receive stolen data from a target network” (Trend Micro, 2020).

The  science  of  encrypting  and  decrypting  information  is  called  cryptography”  (Searchsecurity,  2020a).  In  contrast, 
decryption  describes  the  process  of  “transforming  data  that  has  been  rendered  unreadable  through  encryption  back  to  its 
unencrypted form” (Techopedia, 2020).

3.3.1.2  ISR:  NATO  Joint  Intelligence,  Surveillance  and  Reconnaissance  Division 

(JISR) 

JISR  gathers  data  and  information  for  NATO  AGS  through  a  wide  variety  of  national  ISR  assets 
from  the  space,  air,  land,  maritime  and  cyber  domains  (NATO,  2018).  Intelligence  satellite-related 
information is handled by NATO’s intelligence community at the NATO Headquarters in Brussels, 
Belgium  and  at  the  NATO  Supreme  Headquarters  Allied  Powers  Europe  (SHAPE)  near  Mons, 
Belgium; processes and agreements with MS are here created to secure access to nationally gathered 
data (Heren, 2020). Most agreements are established with the US, UK, France, Germany, and Italy. 
However,  as  commercial  ISR  has  significantly  increased  over  the  past  two  decades,  NATO  also 
acquires commercial data for these purposes. 

3.3.1.3  Awareness: NATO Space Centre  

In October 2020, NATO SG Stoltenberg announced the establishment of a new NATO Space Centre 
in Ramstein, Germany, which 

“will be a focal point to support NATO missions with communications and satellite imagery, 
share  information  about  potential  threats  to  satellites  and  coordinate  our  activities  in  this 
crucial domain […] to increase NATO’s awareness of challenges in space, and the Alliance’s 
ability to deal with them” (NATO, 2020).  

Furthermore, NATO states that the NATO Space Centre “will be housed within existing facilities at 
Allied Air Command and will initially be staffed with a small team of officers and experts already 
working  at  the  command”  (NATO,  2020).  The  Space  Centre  is  expected  to  start  working  and 
partnering  with  MS  at  the  beginning  of  2021,  to  provide  space-related  services  and  products  to 
support NATO missions, operations, and activities. 

3.3.1.4  Coordination: NATO Space Support Coordination (SpSC) 

Space  Support  Coordination  (SpSC)  within  NATO  operations  is  strategically  hatted  by  ACO  at 
SHAPE. Its role is defined in AJP-3.3: 

“Commanders  at  every  level  have  responsibility  […]  to  include  the  use  of  space-based 
capabilities  […]  The  space  coordination  function  will  have  responsibility  for  planning  the 
integration  of  space  force  enhancement  tools  and  capabilities;  the  integration  and 
coordination  of  space  control  and  space  situational  awareness  activities;  and  provide  space 
analysis expertise and space related products” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-8). 

AJP 3.3 (B) further details that SpSC is responsible to “provide timely recommendations to courses 
of  action  […]  collect,  understand  and  process  requests  for  space  support  [and]  support  the 
identification  and  recommendation  for  prioritization  of  delivery  of  space  related  products  and 
services” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-8). Tactically, SpSC is ad hoc-created through an SpSC Element (SpSCE) 
per  mission,  being  assigned  to  NATO  corps  air,  naval  and  land  operations,  and  are  permanently 
staffed with one or two Subject Matter Experts (SME; Vasen, 2020, pp. 23-25).

3.3.1.5  Counselling: Joint Air Power Competence Centre (JAPCC) 

The  Joint  Air  Power  Competence  Centre  (JAPCC,  2020),  located  in  Kalkar,  Germany,  is  NATO-
accredited COE, consisting of independent, multinational experts (Heren, 2020). Existing since 2005, 
it provides  

“subject matter expertise across a broad range of Joint Air and Space Power mission areas 
and  leads  NATO  in  the  development  of  Concepts  and  Doctrine,  Capability  Development, 
Education  and  Training,  Exercise  Development  and  Execution,  and  Lessons  Learned” 
(NATO ACT, 2020).  

As  of  June  2020,  JAPCC  maintains  a  separate  branch  focused  exclusively  on  space  that  aims  to 
gather  cross-community  experts  such  as  from  the  fields  of  intelligence,  communications  or 
meteorology  in  order  to  bring  in  more  perspectives  and  support  educated  operational  decisions  by 
NATO (JAPCC, 2020). Furthermore, the issue of standing-up a new NATO Space COE is currently 
being discussed between the existing, and potentially expanding, role of the JAPCC and a proposal 
for a new NATO-accredited organisation in France. 

3.3.1.6  Counselling: Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 

Like  JAPCC,  the  Cooperative  Cyber  Defence  Centre  of  Excellence  (CCDCOE)  is  a  NATO-
accredited hub to support MS and NATO with expertise on cyber defence. Thereby, Cyber defence is 
defined as the protection of NATO’s  

“own  networks  (including  operations  and  missions)  and  enhanced  resilience  across  the 
Alliance [including] awareness, education, training, and exercise activities, and […] further 
progress  in  various  cooperation  initiatives,  including  those  with  partner  countries  and 
international  organisations.  It  also  foresees  boosting  NATO’s  cooperation  with  industry, 
including  on  information-sharing  and  the  exchange  of  best  practices.  Allies  have  also 
committed to enhancing information-sharing and mutual assistance in preventing, mitigating 
and recovering from cyberattacks” (NATO, 2020a). 

Within CCDCOE, this includes a “diverse group of experts from 29 nations [which] brings together 
researchers,  analysts  and  educators  from  the  military,  government,  academia  and  industry 49 ” 
(CCDCOE,  2020).  There  is  also  support  for  research  and  reporting  on  NATO  outer  space-related 
vulnerabilities (CCDCOE, 2019). 

3.3.2  Allied Member States  

As NATO does not own its own on-orbit space assets, it leaves it up to its MS “to determine whether 
they  provide  access  to  their  satellite  capabilities  [through]  memoranda  of  understanding  with  allies 
for possible use of space products and services” (Unal, 2019, p. 9). This cooperation allows NATO’s 
military  commanders  and  decision-making  staff  to  have  critical  and  highly  sensitive  data  at  their 
command to facilitate NATO missions (Bimfort, 1995, p. 1; Unal, 2019, p. 9; see 3.2.2 and 3.2.5). 
The NSO states that whilst MS space support is not mandatory, 

21 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 3: NATO Use of Space 

“formal agreements should regulate NATO’s degree of access, service level and coordination 
mechanisms.  Nations  sharing  space  services  and  products,  or  otherwise  contributing  space 
support to NATO operations, should consider providing planning information and designating 
a point of contact for coordination purposes” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-5). 

3.4  Summary 

Space  assets  are  key  enablers  for  NATO’s  most  advanced  technological  systems,  missions,  and 
operations. Key functions to enable core tasks like SSA and DSC are:

Facing a rapid arms race in and through space. 

Whilst  NATO  launched  in  total  8  satellites  between  1970  and  1993  through  SATCOM1,  this 
programme was replaced in 2005 by NSP2K. Even though NATO maintains four terrestrial GS, there 
has  been  a  marked  paradigm  shift  from  owning  and  operating  proper  satellites  to  using  national 
MILSATCOM  services,  which  are  managed  by  JPMO.  In  2019,  NATO  published  its  first  Space 
Policy  and  separate  recognition  of  space  as  an  operational  domain  alongside  air,  land,  sea,  and 
cyberspace. Hence, it responded to the need for aligning MS positions, operational legal space asset 
support, increasing the operational dependence on space assets, and assisting the rise of sensible ISR 
exchange within NATO for better imagery and data analysis through JISR. Finally, in 2020, a newly 
established MOU between NATO, US, France, UK, and Italy ensures space asset support for fifteen 
more  years,  with  NCIA  handling  most  of  SATCOM,  and  JISR  being  mainly  responsible  for  ISR 
retrieval and exchange. Awareness and counselling are provided by JAPCC, CCDCOE and the soon-
to-be-established Space COE, whilst SpSC coordinates and integrates operational space functions.  

However,  this  wide  spread  of  responsibilities  over  the  whole  of  NATO’s  internal  and  external 
systems, being visualized in Figure 1 (see below), might obscure, or leave open the quest for liability

in  case  of  an  attack.  This  is  aggravated  by  the  lacking  security  of  space  assets  themselves.  Whilst 
space technology and components are indivisibly linked to cyberspace, cyberspace’s ubiquitous and 
interconnected  nature  makes  attribution  of  malicious  actors  (see  Chapter  4.1)  extremely  difficult. 
Such cyber insecurities add additional pressure on the safeguarding and integrity of NATO missions. 
Subsequently, Chapter 4 identifies and analyses such vulnerabilities.

Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

4  SPACE ASSET CYBERSECURITY GAPS  

Sophisticated cyberattacks on NATO or its MS’s space assets have a distinct new impact on NATO 
operational  decision-making  as  they  “render  NATO  countries  vulnerable  to  [adversarial]  deception 
and information operations” (Unal, 2019, p. 18). Physically, space remains a remarkably transparent 
domain,  unlike  air  or  sea  (Paulauskas,  2020,  pp.  4-7).  However,  NATO’s  growing  military 
dependence  on  commercial  space-based  assets  increases  the  number  of  cyberattacks  and 
vulnerabilities, denying and disrupting vital information flow (Moon, 2017, pp. 4-10). Any attack on 
SATCOM,  ISR,  or  PNT  through  cyberspace  jeopardises  NATO’s  missions  and  services  and 
diminishes  and  confidentiality50.  Consequences  could  run  “from  a  mild  inconvenience  to  a  vital 
security  threat  […]  to  the  inability  to  coordinate  and  operate  modern  forces”  (Moon,  2017,  p.  12). 
This situation is aggravated by the absence of an international framework adapted to today’s space 
environment realities such as privatisation and democratisation (see Chapter 4.2.4). For NATO, this 
means a significant threat to critical force manoeuvres, situational and strategic awareness, as well as 
precision-strike capabilities and efficient and quick reactions to a crisis. The subsequent chapter aims 
at identifying current space asset cybersecurity gaps, therefore diminishing NATO’s credibility and 
hence capability to deter. 

4.1  Malicious Actors and Motivations  

Actors  behind  cyber-attacks  on  NATO  space  assets  are  grouped  into  either  nation-state  actors, 
professional or amateur hackers, organised criminals, or insiders (Moon, 2017, p. 7). Thereby,  

-  Nation-state  actors  seek  military  advantage  through  stealing  intellectual  property  and  pose 
the  biggest  threat  to  Alliance  operations  and  missions  (AOM),  because  they  have  the 
resources  and  capacities  to  conduct  activities  such  as  “terrorism,  espionage,  subversion, 
sabotage, organised crime [or] the relatively safe and global reach of espionage actions via 
cyberspace” (NSO, 2020, p. 6; Heren, 2020).  

-  Professional  or  amateur  hackers,  thus  non-state  actors,  generally  with  the  aim  of  proving 
their  skills  or  motivated  by  personal  interests  such  as  hacktivism51.  These  actors  can  either 
operate individually or in groups. However, they may as well complement nation states with 
required  cyber  knowledge,  skills,  and  resource  means.  Further  motivation  may  include  the 
monitoring of data and communication traffic patterns via space assets or inserting corrupted 
or false data to the system (Harrison et al., 2019, p. 5).  

50 Confidentiality  being  defined as  “privacy.  Making  sure  only  the people who  require  access  to  data have access,  while 
also making sure that everyone who needs the data is able to access it” (NASA, 2019). 
51 Hacktivism:  the  act  of  “misusing  a  computer  system  or  network  for  a  socially  or  politically  motivated  reason  […it]  is 
meant to call the public's attention to something the hacktivist believes is an important issue or cause, such as freedom of 
information  or  human  rights.  It  can  also  be  a  way  for  the  hacktivists  to  express  their  opposition  to  something  by,  for 
instance,  displaying  messages  or  images  on  the  website  of  an  organization  they  believe  is  doing  something  wrong” 
(Searchsecurity, 2020b).  

25 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

-  Organised  criminals  usually  seek  financial  gain  by  exploiting  cyberspace’s  anonymity  and 
connectivity, possibly impacting military undertakings (NSO, 2020, p. 6). This might include 
ransomware52 attacks on infrastructure or data. 

- 

Insiders such as disgruntled NATO personnel may deliberately aim to exploit cyberspace to 
harm  NATO.  This  takes  place  regardless  of  seniority  or  role  and  may  give  adversaries  an 
opening  to  circumvent  existing  cybersecurity  measures  (NSO,  2020,  p.  6).  This  threat  is 
usually underestimated and requires specific guidelines to be dealt with. 

Thereby,  timely  and  accurate  cyberattack  attribution  becomes  extremely  difficult,  since  attackers 
may use many identity-concealing methods, such as are false flag campaigns53 (Harrison et al., 2019, 
p.  5),  as  well  as  due  to  both  cyberspace’s  and  outer  space’s  ambiguous  and  completely  borderless 
nature. Nonetheless, it remains an important piece of deterrence by combining several factors such as 
an adversary’s intent, capability, technical Indicators of Compromise54, geopolitical status and solid 
intelligence. Attribution is needed to ensure that adversaries realize that there will be consequences 
for actions taken in the cyber domain, hence adding to NATO’s resilience posture. 

4.2  Vulnerabilities 

Space  assets  consist  of  three  technological  segments,  forming  their  Satellite  C2  Architecture,  thus 
“how  users  control  and  communicate  with  satellites”  (US  DIA,  2019,  p.  7).  This  includes  the 
physical GS, the space segment as well as the data link connection between the two of them (Baram 
& Wechsler, 2020, p. 2; Unal, 2019, p. 3). By taking out even just one of these segments through a 
cyberattack, the whole of the space asset system is likely to render inoperable (Paulauskas, 2020, p. 
7).  

4.2.1  Ground Segment 

As stated by Caudill (2020), every GS not deliberately secured “is to be assumed unsecure, starting 
from its system design”. This negatively impacts the Information Technology55 (IT) used within the 
space  asset  (Bander  et  al.,  2020).  Thereby,  GSs  “constitute  a  critical  vulnerability,  as  [such]  a 
terminal is an access point to a satellite and is usually not protected by authentication in order not to 

52 Ransomware: Malicious software “that infects your computer and displays messages demanding a fee to be paid in order 
for your system to work again” (Kaspersky, 2020). 
53 False  Flag  campaigns:  Refer  to  cyberattack  tactics  applied  “to  deceive  or  misguide  attribution  attempts  including  the 
attacker’s  origin,  identity,  movement,  and  exploitation”  (Skopik  &  Pahi,  2020,  p.  1),  such  as  buying,  leasing,  or 
compromising infrastructure in the country being blamed, using internet addresses referring to a specific country, change 
language used in the malware, or use personal data of uninvolved individuals, often retrieved from open-sources like social 
media. 
54 Indicators of Compromise: IoC’s are defined as “forensic evidence of potential intrusions on a host system or network. 
These artifacts enable information security (InfoSec) professionals and system administrators to detect intrusion attempts or 
other malicious activities. Security researchers use IOCs to better analyze a particular malware’s techniques and behaviors. 
IOCs  also  provides  actionable  threat  intelligence  [and  may  include  for  example]  Unusual  traffic  going  in  and  out  of  the 
network;  Unknown  files,  applications,  and  processes  in  the  system;  Suspicious  activity  in  administrator  or  privileged 
accounts;  Irregular  activities  such  as  traffic  in  countries  an  organization  doesn’t  do  business  with;  Anomalous  spikes  of 
requests and read volume in company files; Network traffic that traverses in unusually used ports; Tampered file, Domain 
Name Servers (DNS) and registry configurations” (Trendmicro, 2020). 
55 Information  Technology:  Physical  entities  and  their  tangible  components  such  as  “computers,  servers,  routers,  hubs, 
switches, wiring and other equipment crucial to data storage, data processing and data transmission” (NSO, 2020, p. 3). 

26 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

hinder operational actions” (Unal, 2019, p. 8). Thus, computer systems connecting GS internally and 
to their surroundings are likely to be attacked, as they might be commingled with unsecure enterprise 
computer applications (Lee, 2020). GS run often outdated or common operational computer systems 
controlling  antennas  for  SATCOM  data  transfer,  instead  of  specialized,  secured  systems  (Tucker, 
2019). This is aggravated by frequently unsegmented56 networks especially in the commercial sector, 
which  are  critical  satellite  applications  installed  on  the  same  computer  as  commercial,  unsecured 
software.  Therefore,  transmission  of  sensible  data  may  easily  be  intercepted  through  cyberspace, a 
common and consistent method across cyberattacks on GSs (Conti, 2020).  

Additionally, the supporting CI around a GS poses a major vulnerability because it is vital to ensure 
GS  power  supply  (Yingst,  2020).  This  includes  energy  resources  such  as  pipelines  or  as  well 
transportation networks. Corresponding attack vectors mainly include exploiting above stated system 
vulnerabilities or luring GS personnel to download malwares57 to GS computers through phishing58, 
spearphishing5960,  identity  theft61,  or  social  engineering62 (Lee,  2020)  attacks.  In  particular,  social 
engineering is often underestimated and requires a thorough training of all involved staff members to 
be  successfully  thwarted.  Further  major  GS-affiliated  cyberattack  types  include  Denial  of  Service63 
(DoS)  or  ransomware  attacks,  allowing  attackers  to  control  and  maybe  even  damage  the  GS  (see 
Chapter 5). Thereby, it is important to note that historically, the internet itself, connecting such GS 
and facilitating data links, was not built focusing on cybersecurity or Confidentiality, Integrity, and 
Availability 64  (CIA),  but  “to  allow  multiple  computers  to  communicate  on  a  single  network” 
(Andrews, 2019, p. 1). 

4.2.2  Space Segment 

Space  segment  describes  those  space  assets  being  installed  on-orbit,  such  as  satellites  themselves 
(Paulauskas,  2020,  p.  4).  It  is  the  least  vulnerable,  since  “once  assets  are  launched,  it  becomes 
extremely  difficult  to  physically  attack  the  hardware,  but  allows  mainly  to  attack  only  via  cyber 
means” (Bander et al., 2020). Additionally, Sielaff states that few countries have the resources and 

56 Network  Segmentation:  describes  the  process  of  dividing  “a  computer  network  into  smaller  parts  […]  to  improve 
network  performance  and  security  […]  improve  cybersecurity  by  limiting  how  far  an  attack  can  spread.  For  example, 
segmentation keeps a malware outbreak in one section from affecting systems in another [, and] stop harmful traffic from 
reaching devices that are unable to protect themselves from attack” (Cisco, 2020). 
57 Malware: Also malicious software; “any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems“ (Malwarebytes, 2020c). 
58 Phishing:  is defined as “a form of fraud in which an attacker masquerades as a reputable entity  or person in email or 
other  forms  of  communication  [usually  through]  phishing  emails  to  distribute  malicious  links  or  attachments  that  can 
perform a variety of functions” (Searchsecurity, 2020c). 
59 Spearphishing:  A  targeted  phishing  attempt  at  “a  specific  individual,  company,  or  industry  will  be  targeted  by  the 
adversary  […]  Adversaries  may  send  victims  emails  containing  malicious  attachments  or  links,  typically  to  execute 
malicious code on victim systems or to gather credentials“ (Mitre Att&ck, 2020). 
60 Ransomware: Malicious software “that infects your computer and displays messages demanding a fee to be paid in order 
for your system to work again” (Kaspersky, 2020). 
61 Identity  Theft:  Occurs „when a criminal obtains or uses the personal information [...] of someone else to assume their 
identity  or  access  their  accounts  for  the  purpose  of  committing  fraud,  receiving  benefits,  or  gaining  financially  in  some 
way“ (Malwarebytes, 2020b). 
62 Social Engineering: Attack type accomplished “through human interactions [which] uses psychological manipulation to 
trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information” (Imperva, 2020). 
63 Denial-of-Service (DoS): “attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. 
DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash” (Palo Alto, 
2020). 
64 Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) Triad: a “concept model used for information security” (NASA, 2019) 
(see in order footnote 48, Chapter 1 and footnote 16).  

27 

 
 
 
Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

capabilities  to  physically  approach  a  space  segment  on-orbit  for  an  attack.  However,  remaining 
vulnerabilities include:  

-  Legacy  systems  in  case  of  aged  satellites,  whose  systems  having  been  built  with  no 
cybersecurity  awareness  and  are  entry  points  for  more  up-to-date  cyberattack  technology 
(Bander et al., 2020; see 4.2.3.3); and  

-  The use of satellites reduced in size and weight (Small Satellites/ CubeSats), produced fast 

and cheap by suppliers seeing investment in cybersecurity as a hurdle (see below). 

4.2.2.1  Use of Small Satellites 

At  this  moment,  NATO  is  basing  space-based  requirements  on  satellites  being  installed  in 
Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO), located at 35,786 kilometres above Earth’s equator (Paulauskas, 2020, 
p.  4).  This  distance  allows  satellites  to  match  the  rotation  of  Earth,  making  them  useful  for  steady 
SATCOM, monitoring weather, and surveillance. However, NATO MS’s interest in integrating the 
use  of  Small  Satellites  (SmallSats)  increases.  SmallSats  are  typically  located  in  Low-Earth  Orbit 
(LEO)  at  an  altitude  of  around  1000  km  to  160  km  above  Earth’s  equator  (ESA,  2020).  Thereby, 
UNOOSA states that  

“small  satellites  and  their  applications  have  opened  the  door  for  many  countries  […]  with 
limited  funds  for  space  activities  to  join  in  the  exploration  and  the  peaceful  uses  of  outer 
space and to become developers of space technology” (UNOOSA, 2015, p. 3).  

UNOOSA groups SmallSats into “mini satellites < 100 kg, nano satellites < 10 kg, pico satellites < 1 
kg  [and]  femto  satellites  < 0,1 kg”  (UNOOSA, 2015,  p.  3).  Nano  satellites  and  smaller are  as well 
named CubeSats, which are “a class of research spacecraft […] built to standard dimensions (Units 
or  “U”)  of  10  cm  x  10  cm  x  10  cm”  (NASA,  2015)  and  generally  weight  around  one  kilogram. 
Typical  characteristics  include  “reasonably  short  development  times;  relatively  small  development 
teams; modest development and testing infrastructure requirements; and affordable development and 
operation costs for the developers, in other terms ‘faster, cheaper and smaller’” (UNOOSA, 2015, p. 
3). SmallSats are easily and rapidly developed and deployed on-orbit, and deliver on the rising need 
for higher quality ISR through enhanced bandwidth and terrestrial coverage (Hallex & Cottom, 2020, 
pp. 24-25). Additionally, due to their smaller distance to earth, military SATCOM is delivered at a 
lower  latency  rate  than  that  delivered  by  GEO  satellites,  whilst  GEO  satellites  take  longer  to  be 
replaced in case of a critical attack or denial (Thomas, 2020, p. 1). As an example, the US DOD’s 
Advanced  Research  Projects  Agency  (DARPA)  is  currently  developing  the  Blackjack  project,  an 
experimental  programme  to  create  a  large  SmallSat  constellation  in  LEO  aiming  to  provide  DOD 
“with highly connected, resilient, and persistent coverage” (Thomas, 2020, p. 1) by 2021.  

Furthermore,  Falco  points  to  PNT  as  a  common  use  case  for  SmallSats,  as  commercial  companies 
bring  measurements  such  as  enhanced  GPS,  specific  time  control  systems,  or  scientific  research. 
Thus,  the  UK  Government  is  currently  preparing  to  collaborate  with  the  private  company  Horizon 
Technologies  Inc.  on  enhanced  Maritime  Domain  Awareness 65  (MDA)  through  the  usage  of 

65 Maritime Domain Awareness: is the “effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime domain that could impact 
the security, safety, economy, or environment” (DHS, 2005). Aim is to collect “the maximum information and intelligence about any ship 
or vessel in the country’s waters. With the collected data, a complete inference can be drawn about all those marine areas that could cause 
potential damage with respect to safety, eco-system and the economic system. This process is known as actionable intelligence” (Maritime 
Insight, 2018).

Horizon’s  CubeSat  constellation66 AMBERTM,  being  launched  in  2021  (Urban,  2020).  This  public-
private partnership (PPP) will provide RF intelligence data from anywhere in the world and in near-
real time, and hence would allow for more informed decision-making throughout NATO operations 
(L3Harris, 2016, p. 3). This includes automated tracking and monitoring of ship-installed transceivers 
and satellite phones, which could be used by NATO to locate smuggler and piracy communication 
and detect malicious actors, control borders, and prevent potential terrorist attacks (Urban, 2020).  

Hence, investing in a greater number of SmallSats might increase military resilience, as in case of an 
attack  against  such  a  constellation,  the  extreme  disaggregation  degree  allows  for  only  regional 
attacks.  Additionally,  the  loss  of  few  space  assets  would  not  risk  the  constellation’s  availability  to 
function, whilst the replacement of SmallSats is relatively inexpensive (Vasen, 2020b). However, the 
use of SmallSats comes with significant risks:  

-  Commercial SmallSat components are customarily procured from COTS technology to lower 
costs.  Hence,  due  to  the  wide  availability  of  COTS  products,  hackers  might  more  easily 
conduct  component  analysis  and  better  prepare  for  attacks  (Akoto,  2020,  p.  2).  Such 
components draw on open-source technology, allowing hackers to insert vulnerabilities such 
as  backdoors  to  space  asset  software.  Additionally,  these  practices  cause  the  reliance  on 
miscellaneous  standards,  infrastructure,  and  governmental  frameworks  and,  which  render 
SmallSats  less  controllable  and  more  vulnerable  to  cyberthreats  than  more  centralized  and 
aligned SATCOM interfaces67 (see 5.2.4). 

-  Commercial SmallSat producers may tend to circumvent cybersecurity controls for financial 
reasons,  in  contrast  to  technically  and  strategically  more  experienced  producers  of  GEO 
satellites (Livingstone, 2020). This happens especially if the CubeSat mission is cheaper in 
itself than the implementation of such controls (see 5.2.6). 

- 

SmallSats  are  more  easily  locatable  and  thus  eliminable  due  to  their  reduced  geographic 
distance (Hallex & Cottom, 2020, pp. 24-25). Constellations are more likely to be targeted 
by cyberattacks, as attackers might affect a whole, interconnected network through only one 
cyberattack.  

-  The integration and coordination of data retrieved from private Smallsat constellations into 
existing  military  GS  might  be  problematic  (Strout,  2020,  p.  1).  Reasons  are,  for  example, 
misaligned  security  or  classification  levels  (see  5.2.3).  This  was  observed  during  the  US 
DOD’s Blackjack, comprising the processing of data on the ground. 

-  Less redundancy securities and encryption possibilities are available from SmallSats. This is 
due to the reduced size of the system, restricting the amount of antennas and frequency bands 
being built in, as well as stored energy resources (Vasen, 2020b; see 5.2.3). 

4.2.3  Data Link Segment 

The  data  link  segment  describes  the  connection  between  satellites  and  GS,  hence  the  information 
flow  between  “firmware,  operating  systems,  protocols,  applications,  and  other  software  and  data 
components” (NSO, 2020, p. 3). Bander et al. (2020) define it as “the data going back and forth to the 

66 Satellite Constellation: “several satellites working in coordination with each other” (MIT, 2017, p. 1). 
67 Interface: Defined as the set of devices „provided by a computer or a program to allow the user to communicate and use 
the computer or program“ (TechTarget, 2020). 

29 

 
 
 
Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

satellites”, sending commands and preserving communication. The GS personnel “uses the uplink to 
the spacecraft to deliver commands. The spacecraft downlink is how data is sent from the spacecraft 
to  a  GS  that  has  the  necessary  antennas,  transmitters,  and  receivers  to  receive  the  data”  (US  DIA, 
2019, p. 7). In case of malicious interference, severe outage will be caused. Risks connected to the 
data link segment include: 

-  Data  might  be  destroyed  or  interfered  during  its  transfer,  suppressing  or  interrupting  the 
service and rendering reception and/or decryption impossible for its end user (Vasen, 2020b). 

-  Encryption  key  management  of  Telemetry,  Tracking  and  Command  (TTC)  systems  are 
oftentimes not handled in a secure manner (ESA, 1996, p. 3). TTCs are defined as the vital 
functions  of  a  space  asset  “allowing  data  to  be  communicated  between  the  ground  and  the 
spacecraft for spacecraft control and command” (ESA, 1996, p. 3). This exposes space assets 
to misconfiguration, hacking and encryption or decryption of communication data (Caudill, 
2020).  

-  Eased  direct  attacks  due  to  the  above  stated  reasons,  which  includes  the  hacking  and  re-
writing of computer files leading to damage, modification or destruction of mission-critical 
data (Cimpanu, 2020, p. 1). 

4.2.3.1  Jamming 

Jamming  constitutes  the  most  common  threat  to  space  assets  and  Global  Navigation  Satellite 
Systems 68 (GNSS)  and  can  be  executed  both  by  means  of  cyber  and  electronic  warfare 69  (EW) 
(Baram  &  Wechsler,  2020,  p.  3).  Thereby,  Moon  states  that  GNSS  and  attached  civil  applications 
have been oftentimes not designed with cybersecurity in mind (Moon, 2017, p. 8). Signals received 
from  satellites  to  determine  the  GPS  location  of  users  may  be  distorted  or  overridden  through 
commercially-available GPS jammers, which is “a typically small, self-contained, transmitter device 
used  to  conceal  one’s  location  by  sending  radio  signals  with  the  same  frequency  as  a  GPS  device. 
When this occurs, the GPS device is unable to determine its position due to interference” (Geotab, 
2020). GPS jammers, that are often used to disable track and trace of military trucks and have a reach 
range  of  about  100  metres,  may  cost  as  little  as  20  Euros  and  are  unrestrictedly  accessible  to  less-
resourceful malicious actors (Falco, 2020; JammerShop, 2020). As stated by US DIA,  

“Uplink  jamming  is  directed  toward  the  satellite  and  impairs  services  for  all  users  in  the 
satellite  reception  area.  Downlink  jamming  has  a  localized  effect  because  it  is  directed  at 
ground  users,  such  as  a  ground  forces  unit  using  satellite  navigation  to  determine  their 
location” (US DIA, 2019, p. 9). 

Additionally, NATO currently bases its navigation solely on US GPS, thus increasing vulnerability if 
being  jammed.  As  an  example,  Russian  malicious  actors  reportedly  jammed  GPS  signals  during 
NATO Exercise Trident Juncture 2018 (TRJE18) in Finland and northern Norway (O’Dwyer, 2018; 
Unal, 2019, p. 6; Baram & Wechsler, 2020, pp. 2-3), whilst NATO officials expressed that Russia 
may have been actively testing this capability through large-scale exercises, for example during its 

68 GNSS: see Footnote 65. 
69 Electronic Warfare: whilst cyberattacks are executed via cyberspace (see footnote 9), EW attacks are take place within 
the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) which is defined as the “range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation from zero 
to  infinity”  (Bommakanti,  2019,  p.  10),  thus  the  totality  of  wavelengths  and  frequencies  (footnotes  36).  Use  of  Cyber  is 
often also named as “protocol level/layer attack” as in opposition to physical layer attack. See 6.2.2: ISO 27000.

military  exercise  ZAPAD  2017,  carried  out  in  cooperation  with  Belarus  (Atlantic  Council,  2018). 
Thus,  NATO  should  start  creating  more  redundancies,  such  as  through  increased  integration  of 
European Galileo spectrums70. 

4.2.3.2  Spoofing 

The second most used technique to attack space assets is spoofing, which is the “faking [of] signals 
by  broadcasting  incorrect  GPS  signals,  structured  to  resemble  genuine  ones”  (Baram  &  Wechsler, 
2020, p. 3). Similar to jamming, spoofing may be executed both by cyber and EW means (Baram & 
Wechsler, 2020, p. 3). This involves tampering71 or disrupting frequency signalling, and may as well 
target  unencrypted  satellite  traffic.  Spoofing  is  an  adversarial  way  to  manipulate  information  on 
position, location, and condition of satellite systems, being relatively difficult to detect (Moon, 2017, 
p. 8). Being more difficult to execute than jamming, spoofing attacks are more often performed by 
nation  state  actors,  and  have  been  “readily  used  by  Russian  or  Chinese  military”  (Falco,  2020). 
Throughout spoofing, CI such as national power grids can be disrupted by inducing false timing data 
and  signals,  denying  military  C2  in  times  of  crisis.  This  constitutes  a  more  dangerous  threat  than 
jamming,  as  victims  usually  do  not  realize  the  attack.  As  an  example,  the  2017  Report  on  US 
Maritime  Administration  stated  that  at  least  20  vessels  were  spoofed  and  navigated  up  to  30 
kilometres  away  from  their  original  destination,  raising  assumptions  that  Russia  possibly 
experimented on new spoofing techniques (Hambling, 2017; UNCTAD, 2017, p. 101). 

4.2.3.3  Legacy systems 

Since  space  missions  may  last  decades,  space  assets  are  unique  in  their  lack  of  physical  access, 
decade-long lifespan of on-orbit space segments and hence regularly obsolete legacy systems (Falco, 
2018; Koch & Golling, 2016). A legacy system still “meets the needs it was originally designed for, 
but  doesn’t  allow  for  growth  [and]  won’t  allow  it  to  interact  with  newer  systems”  (Talend,  2020). 
Thereby, once a space segment is being deployed, operators and builders are unlikely to regain direct 
access for around twelve to eighteen months (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). Basement retro engineering of 
cybersecurity controls is highly complicated and expensive. Attackers may use this vulnerability to 
upload  malware  into  such  often  unencrypted  satellites,  using  more  advanced  terrestrial  technology 
(Falco, 2020). According risks include 

1.  The initial use of proprietary and old IT software and hardware, thus outdated, unpatched72 

IT systems; 

2.  Security and reliability problems unfolding through hindered supply of spare parts becoming 

unavailable over time;  

3.  The  inability  or  failure  to  conduct  software  updates  regularly,  to  remove  detected 

vulnerabilities (Unal, 2019, p. 8). 

70 Spectrum: See footnote 66. 
71 Tampering:  to  “interfere  so  as  to  weaken  or  change  for  the  worse  […]  to  render  something  harmful  or  dangerous  by 
altering its structure or composition” (Merriam-Webster, 2020f). 
72 Patch:  A  patch  is  “a  software  update  comprised  code  inserted  (or  patched)  into  the  code  of  an  executable  program. 
Typically, a patch is installed into an existing software program [to] Address new security vulnerabilities, Address software 
stability issues, Upgrade the software”  

31 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

However, as put by Falco (2018b), since “space assets are built to last […] space asset cybersecurity 
is  mission  critical;  system  downtime  is  not  an  option”  (Falco,  2018b).  Therefore,  when  producing 
space assets, companies “tend to put as much flexibility as possible into the space asset to cover those 
legacy issues” (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). 

4.2.4  Lacking Exchange of Academic Expertise   

Among scholars and practitioners, there is high concern over lacking expertise on the nexus between 
space  and  cybersecurity,  as  “how  cybersecurity  is  should  be  integrated  into  the  design  of  aircraft, 
space  assets,  and  into  space  operations”  (S.  Lee,  2020).  This  mindset  denies  both  academics  and 
practitioners  the  ability  to  establish  knowledge  and  awareness.  Hence,  “it  is  not  unusual  for  the 
industry  to  be  kind  of  unfamiliar  with  cybersecurity  and  to  have  a  hard  time  adapting  to  it  when 
manufacturing” (Lee, 2020). Underlining Lee’s statement, Livingstone points to the general lack of 
education on reasons behind attacks on commercial space assets, influencing commercial judgements 
“that have to be made between how much governments spend on a commercial offering compared to 
how much gets invested in cybersecurity of space assets” (Livingstone, 2020).  

Additionally, Zarkan points to a significant lack of knowledge and awareness due to the reluctance of 
NATO MS governments to report cyberattacks against space systems, as this might undermine their 
credibility, and thus deterrence of attacks. Silverstein states that all NATO “security activities [are] 
severely undermined by the alliance’s inability or unwillingness to openly communicate about space 
security”  (Silverstein,  2020).  This  is  aggravated  by  the  historically  widely  adopted  concept  of 
Security by Obscurity, or as put by Lee (2020),  “the space asset system I am trying to secure is so 
weird, unusual or rare, how would anybody ever figure out how to break it or get into it?”. Persistent 
reliance  on  the  space  asset’s  obscurity  creates  a  false  sense  of  security  and  therefore  ignorance, 
affecting  both  governments  and  big  traditional  commercial  players  such  as  Boeing  or  Airbus. 
However, this obscurity disappears with the entry of commercial companies to the market through an 
ongoing revolutionary industrialisation of space, increasing the amount of data being stored in COTS 
products.  The  lack  of  exchange  across  both  public  and  private  sectors  has  been  aggravated 
significantly  with  the  introduction  of  the  EU  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR)  on  25th 
May 2018. As GDPR imposes a fine of at least 20 Million Euro for private entities, or 4 percent of 
turnover  if  higher  than  20  Million  Euro,  data  losses  are  oftentimes  significantly  belated  reported 
throughout the space asset industry (Data Privacy Manager, 2020; GDPR, 2018). 

For the above named reasons, barely any official incident statements were published throughout past 
years  except  for  few  cases:  In  2014,  the  US  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration 
(NOAA) confirmed in a report the hacking of a satellite, blaming Chinese hackers to have done so 
(Flaherty  et  al.,  2014,  p.  1).  Similarly,  in  2015,  a  hacker  group  apparently  linked  to  the  Russian 
government  was  reported  to  be  using  malware  to  exploit  unencrypted  data  links  to  communication 
satellites (Jones, 2015). 

4.2.5  Lacking Regulation  

To this point, there is no international, legally binding instrument to regulate the conduct of state and 
non-state  actors  in  space,  both  in  general  and  specifically  on  cyber  means.  This  increases 
miscommunication, misuse of the domain, and misperception by nations (Johnson, 2014, p. 1). The 
same is true for the majority of NATO MS, facing both a lack of national policies in many states and 
few existing bilateral agreements related to space-capability data-sharing between MS (Hill, 2020). 

32 

 
 
 
Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

The  following  lists  most  relevant  and  current  international  regulation  and  legal  frameworks  on  the 
nexus between cybersecurity and outer space.  

NATO ALLIED JOINT DOCTRINE FOR CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS, AJP-3.20  

With  regards  to  cyberspace,  NATO  released  in  2020  its  Allied  Joint  Doctrine  for  Cyberspace 
Operations, AJP-3.20 to “plan, execute and assess cyberspace operations (CO)” (NSO, 2020, p. 1). 
In its opening sentences, AJP-3.20 states that 

“digital networks and systems, therefore, need to be safeguarded against information denial 
by disruption, degradation or destruction, and manipulation and exfiltration […] freedom of 
action in cyberspace may be as important as control over land, air and space, or sea” (NSO, 
2020, p. 1). 

Additionally, it acknowledges that all “networks and devices connected by wired connections [and] 
wireless connections” (NSO, 2020, p. 1) might be potential targets. This adds to command challenges 
and  difficulties  in  distinguishing  between  strategic,  tactical,  and  operational  levels  as  well  as 
execution and synchronisation of information, thus compromising NATO’s successful functioning.  

NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY  

Deterrence  of  cyberattacks  on  space  assets  delivering  NATO  operation-relevant  information  is 
severely  hampered  by  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  itself.  As  the  new  NATO  Space  Policy  remains 
classified,  “the  core  security  benefits  of  the  new  space  policy  are  diminished  [and]  open  discourse 
about allied resolve to protect satellites from hostilities” (Silverstein, 2020, p. 1) is prevented. Also, 
“by  not  releasing  the  terms  of  the  policy,  the  alliance  does  not  clearly  outline  if  and  how  [North 
Atlantic Treaty] Article 5 protections apply to space assets” (Silverstein, 2020, p. 1). Thereby, Article 
5, the Principle of Individual or Collective Defence, states that 

“an  armed  attack  against  one  or  more  [parties]  in  Europe  or  North  America  shall  be 
considered  an  attack  against  them  all  [which  then]  will  assist  the  Party  [by  taking]  such 
action as it deems necessary […] to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic 
area” (NATO, 1949). 

Whilst it is widely discussed by scholars if an attack via cyber means may be considered an armed 
attack,  as  it  may  be  not  executed  through  traditional,  physical  armed  forces 73,  Article  5  comes 
additionally solely into action if the requirements of Article 6, the Nationality Principle are met. An 
attack is only recognized if  

“deemed to include an armed attack on the territory of any of the Parties […] on the forces, 
vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area” 
(NATO, 1949),  

applies. However, a “classified internal policy cannot communicate credible resolve to an adversary. 
NATO has yet to concretely affirm the alliance’s commitment to collective defence in outer space” 
(Silverstein,  2020).  Moreover,  for  COs  leading  to  only  temporary  disruption  or  service  denial  of 
NATO-used  space  assets  would  only  be  considered  as  an  armed  attack  if  used  in  the  context  of  a 

73 Armed  Forces:  A  term  used  to  denote  “members  of  the  Army,  Marine  Corps,  Navy,  Air  Force,  and  Coast  Guard” 
(OECD, 2003). 

33 

 
 
 
Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

wider, concurrent conventional attack (NSO, 2020, p. 21). Finally, geographic limits as imposed by 
Article 6 are “incongruent with outer space” (Silverstein, 2020) or cyberspace, as no national borders 
apply in these spheres and as cyberattacks are difficult to attribute to a specific country (Hill, 2020). 
Thus, to this point, there is no comprehensive, unclassified deterrence strategy for NATO MS space 
asset security, whilst its “declaratory policy does not delineate space-based thresholds or actions that 
would trigger NATO to act in collective defence” (Silverstein, 2020). This is especially aggravated 
by  the  fact  that  NATO  itself  states  that  collective  defence  commitments  must  be  “clearly  and 
unambiguously  communicated  to  avoid  misunderstanding  and  miscalculation  by  any  potential 
adversary” (NATO, 2016).  

TALLINN MANUAL 2.0 ON THE INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLICABLE TO CYBER OPERATIONS 

The Tallinn Manual 2.0, prepared in 2017 by the International Groups of Experts at the invitation of 
NATO CCDCOE is the second edition of the CCDCOE’s analysis on the application of international 
law to cyberspace. The analysis emphasises on the “idea that cyber operations do not occur in a legal 
vacuum,  and  pre-existing  obligations  under  international  law  apply  equally  to  the  cyber  domain” 
(National Security Archive, 2019). Chapter 10 emphasises on Space Law, which is the application of 
MS  and  international  treaties  governing  on  the  use  of  outer  space  to  cyber  operations  (CCDCOE, 
2017,  pp.  270-283).  The  Tallinn  Manual  2.0  considers  space,  particularly  space  assets,  as  both  a 
target  and  platform  for  cyberattacks.  It  remarks  MS’s  responsibility  to  supervise  non-state  actor 
activities and state liability for cyber operation outcomes involving space assets. Hence, it states that  

“In the context of a non-State actor’s actions, a State’s preponderant or decisive participation 
in  the  ‘financing,  organising,  training,  supplying,  and  equipping  […]  the  planning  of  the 
whole of its operation’ has been found insufficient to reach the ‘effective control’ threshold” 
(CCDCOE, 2017, p. 97). 

Referring to International Air Law, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 hints to Annex 17 of the 1944 Chicago 
Convention on Civil Aviation, stating that states should  

“ensure  that  measures  are  developed  in  order  to  protect  critical  information  and 
communications  technology  systems  [including]  security  by  design,  supply  chain  security, 
network separation, and remote access control, as appropriate” (CCDCOE, 2017, p. 269). 

However,  due  to  its  nature,  the  Chicago  Convention  does  not  include  any  further  guidance  on  the 
nexus of space assets, cybersecurity and space law but rather focuses on civil aviation regulation. 

CCDCOE  just  announced  its  “commitment  to  host  a  project  to  revise  and  expand  the  influential 
Tallinn Manual 2.0 on International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations [which] will be updated in 
the light of emerging State practice” (CCDCOE, 2020). This Tallinn Manual 3.0 will be a five-year 
project,  involving  an  update  of  all  chapters  and  adding  new  topics  addressing  evolving  cyber 
operations,  including  State  practice,  international  law,  academic  publications  as  well  as  multi-
stakeholder  initiatives  between  governments,  civil  society  players  and  industry.  Hence,  the  Tallinn 
Manual 3.0 presents a fitting opportunity to address gaps. 

EU CODE OF CONDUCT  

In  2007,  2008  and  2014,  the  EU  External  Action  Service  (EEAS)  authored  drafts  for  a  voluntary 
international  Code  of  Conduct  (COC)  for  Outer  Space  Activities  (Johnson,  2014,  p.  1).  The  most 
recent draft aims at enhancing the security, safety, and sustainability of outer space activities through 

34 

 
  
 
Chapter 4: Space Asset Cybersecurity Gaps 

so-called Transparency and Confidence-Building Measures (TCBMs). This underlines the principle 
of  national  responsibility  to  “take  all  appropriate  measures  and  cooperate  in  good  faith  to  avoid 
harmful interference” (DRAFT International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities, 2014, 26-
28). Yet, none of the major space players outside the EU, such as the US, Russia, or China, signed 
this draft. This was justified by voiced concerns about its applicability, “vague terminology and lack 
of  definitions,  [and  therefore]  the  degree  to  which  it  is  legally  binding”  (Johnson,  2014,  p.  2),  and 
facing a lack of consensus on mishaps and best practices.  

EU CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY FOR THE DIGITAL DECADE 

On 16 December 2020, the EU High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security 
Policy and the European Commission presented the new EU Cybersecurity Strategy JOIN(2020) 18 
final (European Council, 2020). This document points specifically to space as being  

“heavily  reliant  on  network  and  information  systems  that  are  increasingly  interconnected 
[whilst  stating  that]  the  threat  landscape  is  compounded  by  geopolitical  tensions  over  the 
global  and  open  Internet  and  over  control  of  technologies  across  the  whole  supply  chain” 
(European Council, 2020, p.  1). 

Furthermore,  it  points  to  the  need  for  an  ultra-secure  communication  infrastructure,  with  EU 
Governmental Satellite Communications providing cost-efficient and secure space-based capabilities 
to  ensure  safety-  and  security-  critical  EU  and  MS  missions  and  operations  including  national 
security  actors  and  EU  institutions  bodies  and  agencies.  Through  the  deployment  of  a  secure 
quantum  communication  infrastructure  (QCI),  the  EU  aims  to  create  a  “new  way  to  transmit 
confidential information using an ultra-secure form of encryption to shield against cyberattacks, built 
with  European  technology  [including]  linked  space  satellites  covering  the  whole  EU,  including  its 
overseas  territories”  (European  Council,  2020,  p.    7).  Additionally,  it  envisions  strengthening  the 
Galileo Security Monitoring Centre and cybersecurity of critical space infrastructures though creating 
a Commission Action Plan on synergies between the defence, civil, and space industries (European 
Council, 2020, p.  18). 

4.3  Summary 

Cybersecurity gaps in the design and operation of space assets are a significant threat to the delivery 
of  mission-critical  data.  Actors  behind  attacks  may  be  classified  as  either  nation-state  actors, 
professional  or  amateur  hackers,  organised  criminals,  or  insiders.  However,  attribution  and 
localization are significantly hindered by the ambiguous nature of cyberspace. Furthermore, if taking 
out a single space asset segment, thus either GS, space segment or data link, the whole of the space 
asset system is likely to become inoperable. Accordingly, main cyber-related risks include:

Table iv: Cyber Vulnerabilities per Space Asset Segment  

Space Asset Segment 

Cyber Vulnerability 

Ground Segment

Data Link Segment 

Legacy and/or unsegmented soft- and hardware being oftentimes installed in 
ground and space segment’s systems, allowing for eased interception of data and 
malware attacks such as through phishing, spearphishing, ransomware, identity 
theft, social engineering, or DoS attacks; 

Increasing use of COTS technology for SmallSats and insecure handling of TTC 
and ISR encryption management, tampering NATO mission-critical data during its 
transfer and allowing for jamming and spoofing of data; 

Organizational 
Handling 

Lack of expertise on the nexus between space and cybersecurity;  

Reluctance of NATO MS governments to report cyberattacks against space 
systems, hindering the development of knowledge and awareness; 

Absence of international instruments to regulate the conduct of state and non-state 
actors in space; geographic limits by NATO Treaty Article 6 being incongruent 
with space and cyberspace, preventing the triggering of Article 5 (Principle of 
Individual or Collective Defence). 

Hence,  hypothesis  one  (H1)  is  confirmed.  However,  it  is  insufficient  in  its  assumption  as  it  has 
become  apparent  that  outsourcing  of  space  capabilities  to  private  companies,  the  use  of  outdated 
software as well as the almost complete lack of international laws and regulations are not the only 
drivers for cyber vulnerabilities along the cyber SASC. Thus, cyber vulnerabilities become ever more 
threatening for NATO as the influence and power of nation states in space are substituted by those of 
commercial, competition-oriented non-state actors. For NATO, this is crucial as a rapidly increasing 
number  of  manufacturers,  globally  widespread,  becomes  involved  in  building  and  proliferating  the 
various  components  of  those  space  assets  that  NATO  retrieves  its  mission-critical  data  from.  The 
industrialization and globalization of space assets multiplies to an uncontrollable number of possible 
cyberthreat actors and vulnerabilities. This might crucially impact NATO as well as its staff on the 
ground, including the evocation of casualties during training and missions. The following Chapter 5 
aims to identify cyber SASC habits throughout NATO, its MS, and commercial partners, as well as 
threats, vulnerabilities and organizational gaps being caused by these structures.

5  NATO SPACE ASSET CYBER SUPPLY CHAIN  

5.1  Background  

The  multiplied  involvement  of  suppliers  and  manufacturers  in  delivering  mission-critical  data  and 
services for the military and NATO opens up numerous cyber intrusion threats (Falco, 2018b; Koch 
& Golling, 2016). As underlined by Akoto, this issue is aggravated by obscure SCs, as the extremely 
complex technical nature of satellites involves multiple manufacturers in building its components and 
launching  those  satellites.  Even  “once  satellites  are  in  space,  day-to-day  management  is  oftentimes 
outsourced  to  other  companies”  (Akoto,  2020,  p.  2).  This  may  lead  to  utilizing  “third-party 
intellectual  property  and/or  open-source  software  or  firmware  with  unknown  vulnerabilities  or 
implants74”  (Bailey,  2019,  p.  7).  The  following  chapter  aims  at  identifying  and  analysing  the  so-
caused vulnerabilities as well as gaps in NATO’s handling of its cyber SASC. 

5.1.1  General 

Boyson et al. coin the expression of cyber SC assurance, with cyber SC being defined as  

“the  entire  set  of  key  actors  involved  with/using  cyber  infrastructure:  system  end-users, 
policy  makers,  acquisition  specialists,  system 
integrators,  network  providers,  and 
software/hardware  suppliers  [and]  these  users/providers’  organizational  and  process-level 
interactions to plan, build, manage, maintain, and defend cyber infrastructure” (Boyson et al., 
2009, p. 5). 

This includes the “integration of computation and physical processes […] and the linking together of 
devices  and  sensors  for  information  sharing”  (Pandey  et  al.,  2020,  p.  3).  Thereby,  cyber  SC 
management describes “everything from product development, sourcing, production and logistics as 
well  as  the  information  systems  needed  to  coordinate  these  activities  to  […]  achieve  a  sustainable 
competitive advantage” (Pandey et al., 2020, p. 3). However, to deliver on such aims, organizations 
are  increasingly  digitising  operations  to  improve  efficiency,  sustainable  growth,  and  cost  of 
processes. This creates new cyber SC risks, caused by adversarial motivation to compromise the SC’s 
integrity,  or  introduce  malicious  functions  to  it.  Cyber  SC  risks  may  occur  in  three  forms:  Supply 
Risks are “failures from supplier (s) or the supply market [as] consumers are not able to know how 
their  product’s  particular  components  are  built”  (Pandey  et  al.,  2020,  p.  14),  being  aggravated  by 
inappropriate  manufacturing  standards.  Operational  Risks  are  defined  as “serious  breach[es]  of  the 
access controls […] allowing the attacker to cause the plant to malfunction and resulting in physical 
damage and operational disruption” (Pandey et al., 2020, p. 14). Such breaches may be perpetrated 
by  perpetration  through  external  entities  or  company  insiders  such  as  employees,  breaching 
regulatory frameworks, manipulating documents, and providing authentication passwords via internet 
or electronic devices. Finally, Demand Risks are defined as “demand disruptions […] because of a 
lack of trust across SC companies” (Pandey et al., 2020, p. 14).  

74 To be understood as the covered implementation of malware before delivery/ throughout the SC.

Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

A  cyber  SC  is  compromised  if  an  adversary  successfully  interferes  with  the  CIA  of  an  attached 
system  or  stored  or  transmitted  information  (CSC,  2020,  p.  138).  The  US  Cybersecurity  and 
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) acknowledges that  

“if  vulnerabilities  in  the  ICT  SC  -  composed  of  hardware,  software,  and  managed  services 
from  third-party  vendors,  suppliers,  service  providers,  and  contractors  -  are  exploited,  the 
consequences can affect all users of that technology or service” (CISA, 2020, p. 1).  

However,  as  stated  by  the  US  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  increasing 
globalization  accelerates  SC  complexity,  creates  prolonged  SC  ecosystems  and  thus  diminishes 
control  and  visibility  (NIST,  2020d).  In  turn,  cyberthreat  actors  increasingly  target  customer  and 
supplier  networks  through  so-called  island  hopping,  which  is  “an  attack  that  focuses  on  impacting 
not  only  the  victim  but  its  customers  and  partners,  especially  if  these  partners  have  network 
interconnections”  (NIST,  2020b,  p.  1).  A  cyber  SC  attack  is  defined  as  “any  deliberate  action  or 
assault  on  the  SC  system  with  the  intent  to  compromise  its  processes,  procedures,  and  delivery  of 
electronic products, information flows and services” (Pandey et al., 2020, p. 9). Such attacks made up 
over  50  percent  of  incidents  in  2019,  having  increased  by  78  percent  over  the  same  year  and 
successfully caused significant damage (Symantec, 2019, p. 9). SC attacks “are most effective when 
they find targets with the broadest reach possible” (Townsend, 2019). Downstream cyberattacks are 
directed  against  customers  in  the  chain,  whilst  upstream  cyberattacks  affect  suppliers,  third-party 
vendors and external organizations remotely accessing the SC system (Pandey et al., 2020, p. 9). This 
may include information distortion attacks on SC members, or the supply of false information such as 
business  licences,  product  test  certificates,  or  trade  documents,  illegally  attracting  customers  by 
stealing  a  well-known  company’s  identity.  Malicious  tampering  of  assets  may  be  caused  by  pre-
installing and hiding malware at one point of a product’s SC. Thereby,  

“vulnerabilities  may  be  introduced  during  any  phase  of  the  product  life  cycle:  design, 
development  and  production,  distribution,  acquisition  and  deployment,  maintenance  and 
disposal  [through]  the  incorporation  of  malicious  software,  hardware,  and  counterfeit 
components;  flawed  product  designs;  and  poor  manufacturing  processes  and  maintenance 
procedures“ (CISA, 2020, p. 1).  

Throughout 2020, NIST criticised that several SC security controls are rarely implemented across the 
private  sector.  This  includes  inconsistent  monitoring  of  supplier  compliance,  incomprehensive 
enforcement  of  anti-malware  protection  mechanisms  and  a  lack  of  logging  of  “critical  suppliers 
accessing networks” (NIST, 2020a, p. 16). 

5.1.2  NATO Cyber Supply Chain Handling 

It  is    key  to  trace  the  NATO  handling  of  its  cyber  SC  throughout  the  organizational  system  and 
mechanisms,  to  locate  potential  cyber  gaps  and  vulnerabilities  when  utilizing  mission-critical 
information retrieved from space assets, and accordingly assign responsibilities. Within NATO, the 
term supply covers “material and items used in the equipment, support, and maintenance of military 
forces  [including  their]  provisioning,  distribution  and  replenishment”  (NATO,  2017,  p.  2).  As 
enabling functions, NATO lists 

1.  Logistic  information  management,  which  couples  IT  to  logistic  processes  to  meet 

information requirements by NATO commanders and allied MS; 

2.  Reception,  staging  and  onward  movement,  or  the  operational  transition  of  personnel,  units, 

materiel, and equipment from arrival to final destination; 

38 

 
 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

3.  Contracting  with  external  suppliers,  which  has  “become  increasingly  important  to  the 
conduct  of  operations,  especially  when  operating  beyond  NATO  territory  [to]  gain  quick 
access  to  in-country  resources  by  procuring  the  supplies  and  services  that  the  commander 
requires” (NATO, 2017, p. 2); and  

4.  Host  nation  support,  to  provide  NATO  commanders  with  arrangements  and  national 

partnerships (NATO, 2017, p. 2). 

Within  NATO,  production  logistics,  also  called  acquisition  logistics,  are  overseen  by  the  NATO 
Conference  of  National  Armament  Directors  (CNAD),  largely  include  the  industrial  domain  and 
concern 

“the  planning,  design,  development  and  procurement  of  equipment  and  therefore  […] 
standardization  and  interoperability,  contracting,  quality  assurance,  acquiring  spares, 
reliability  and  maintainability  analysis,  safety  standards  for  equipment,  specifications  and 
production  processes,  trials  and  testing,  codification,  equipment  documentation,  and 
configuration control and modifications” (NATO, 2017, p. 2). 

The  NATO  NDPP  emphasises  on  cyber  defence  as  a  both  immediate  and  long-term  challenge. 
Thereby, NATO states that “National and NATO logistic plans must ensure that logistic resources of 
sufficient quantity and quality are available […] to support forces as needed” (NATO, 2020, p. 3). As 
stated by Vasen, NATO procures commercial services related to cyber sustainment of commercially 
procured SATCOM services via the NCIA (Vasen, 2020b). Cyber sustainment is described by AJP-
3.20  as  supporting  logistics  being  “dependent  on  cyberspace  with  their  reliance  on  computerised 
networks,  for  example,  to  share  information;  order  material  and  medication;  process  databases;  or 
have a logistical overview” (NSO, 2020, p. 10). It aims to ensure functionality and security of NATO 
systems  and  network,  unobstructed  access  to  them,  maintenance  of  ability  to  perform,  and 
preservation of operational effectiveness.  

In  2018,  the  European  Defense  Agency  (EDA)  stated  that  it  aligned  its  annual  Capability 
Development  Plan  (CDP)  with  the  NDPP,  to  avoid  unnecessary  duplication  (EDA,  2018,  p.  4). 
However, Widmann (2020) sees a major difficulty in aligning NATO’s and the EU’s interests in the 
cyber SC field: whilst the EU rather focuses on economic and political goals, NATO encompasses 
defence and national security issues. Thus, he states that  

“what  happens  is,  the  NDPP  spurs  further  competition  between  private  companies  like 
Airbus  or  Boeing  to  get  awarded  defence  contracts.  There  arise  political  considerations 
which can affect cybersecurity decisions” (Widmann, 2020).  

Furthermore, alignment of MS cybersecurity of their space assets’ SC is hindered, as it is handled by 
each MS independently (see 5.2.4). 

5.2  Threats and Vulnerabilities  

As stated by Falco (2020), SC intrusions are currently considered to be the most important threat to 
space asset security right now. Meanwhile, concerns on cybersecurity of space assets 

“have  historically  focused  mostly  on  electronic  warfare  threats  such  as  jamming  [or] 
spoofing […] Better understanding of cyberthreats has led to a realization that […] motivated 
adversaries may develop highly targeted malware, assumptions about isolated networks may 

39 

 
 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

be invalid, and adversaries may breach development environments and SCs” (Bailey, 2019, 
p. 9). 

Therefore, Caudill (2020) advises to generally assume “that every single component of a space asset 
was  already  maliciously  modified  throughout  its  SC”.  This  is  caused  by  members  in  the  space 
community,  using  for  example  non-authorised  vendors  or  circumventing  supplier  due  diligence75 
(Lister, 2020b). In 2020, the phrase ‘SC security’ became closely interconnected with the use of non-
proprietary,  open-source  software  being  poorly  understood  by  policy-makers  due  to  heightened 
opacity of implemented software, as well as Chinese intrusion for intellectual property theft (Access 
Partnership, 2020, pp. 12-14). Thereby, such SCs are 

“thought to be unsusceptible to cyberattacks due to some of the same reasons as spacecraft: 
closed supply chains, unique embedded hardware/software systems, and physical protections 
[…] Compromising the hardware and software supply chains [was] successfully executed in 
the  IT-embedded  world,  and  space  systems  could  fall  victim  to  similar  attacks  if  proper 
protections are not taken” (Bailey, 2019, p. 9). 

5.2.1  Dual-Use Space Assets: NATO Dependency on the Private Sector 

5.2.1.1  Background 

As stated by NATO NSO, especially in cyberspace and outer space, space assets may be of dual-use, 
thus  “can  be  used  for  both  civilian  and  military  purposes”  (NSO,  2016b;  Unal,  2019,  p.  7).  Most 
space  assets  serve  multiple  commercial  functions,  whilst  “civil  satellites,  operated  by  private 
companies, may be used to fulfil specific missions in locations where NATO allies do not have their 
own  space  equipment”  (Unal,  2019,  p.  8).  MS’  procurement  policies  typically  require  to 
commercially  “procure  equipment  and  software  to  be  integrated  into  their  national  defence 
architecture,  which  becomes  part  of  the  overall  NATO  capability.  The  commercial  supply  chain  is 
embedded  in  nearly  every  aspect  of  military  equipment”  (Unal,  2019,  p.  8).76 Dual-usage  of  space 
assets is not a new phenomenon and coins the term New Space, which is  

“the  growing  use  of  civil  technologies  for  space  missions  and  the  military  working  with 
private  space  companies,  thus  private  companies  operating  in  places  that  just  until  a  few 
years ago were occupied only by government agencies” (Baram, 2020). 

Hence, “the number of private companies that have space assets, and military and national security 
dependence on those systems is much greater than people realise” (Widmann, 2020).  

5.2.1.2  Dual-Use SATCOM Assets 

In  the  field  of  military  communications,  the  highly  secret  SATCOM  is  traditionally  provided  by 
government  satellites  operating  in  GEO.  However,  such  satellites  are  not  competitive  with  new, 
commercial services by SmallSat constellations in LEO (Hallex & Cottom, 2020, p. 21). Newer LEO 
constellations provide lower latency and higher bandwidth, making enhanced SATCOM accessible to 

75 Due  Diligence:  describes  “the  detailed  examination  of  a  company  and  its  financial  records,  done  before  becoming 
involved in a business arrangement with it” (Cambridge Dictionary, 2020b). 
76 Whilst  traditionally,  there  used  to  be  an  innovation  spin-off  from  military  to  industry,  thus  civilian  goods  being  the 
collateral result of military research, it became more of a spin-in on the reverse path (NASA, 2020). 

40 

 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

mobile  users  and  high-latitude  areas  previously  being  outside  GEO  SATCOM  coverage,  such  as 
Alaska, Russia, northern Canada, or Scandinavia. As a result, there is growing military demand for 
such  services.  Examples  are  services  provided  by  the  US  company  SpaceX  Starlink,  having 
contracted with the US government to launch almost 12000 satellites into space, or the UK company 
OneWeb, having just been acquired by the UK government to expand with 2000 satellites by 2020 
(Hallex & Cottom, 2020, p. 21; Henry, 2020). Within NATO NCIA, IT and SATCOM equipment is 
generally bought as COTS from private firms and subsequently being secured - hardened - as “there 
is  no  meaning  to  produce  a  modem  for  military  purposes,  unless  you  need  encryption  and 
decryption” (Conti, 2020). As emphasised by Conti, “SATCOM is really a commercial, not a military 
system. What makes it military, is the subsequent encryption and decryption of data” (Conti, 2020).  

5.2.1.3  Dual-Use ISR Assets 

On the ISR side, NATO MS governments are increasingly utilising commercial assets to provide data 
to the military, due to lower cost and higher access, as commercial providers are confronted with less 
limitations  to  match  intelligence  needs  and  requirements  (Bander  et  al.,  2020).  Using  commercial 
space  assets  for  ISR  a)  frees  up  more  secure  governmental  intelligence  satellites  for  the  most 
important military targets; and b) eases the sharing of commercially gathered imagery with allies as 
this  is  generally  registered  at  a  lower  level  of  classification.  US  DOD  estimated  that  around  80 
percent of DOD SATCOM used commercial lines during the last decade (Bander et al., 2020). This 
is  especially  true  so  for  weather  services  and  in  the  earth  observation  field,  using  commercial 
SmallSat constellations to retrieve high-revisit, optical imagery, all-weather and night-time services 
(Hallex  &  Cottom,  2020,  p.  22).  Therefore,  such  assets  may  significantly  facilitate  and  logistics, 
mapping, and emergency rescue and search. The US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) 
is  the  largest  customer  for  these  services,  profiting  from  lower  prices  for  industrial  monitoring, 
marine  transportation  analytics,  business  intelligence,  resource  management,  and  other  decision-
making, data-driven practices.  

5.2.1.4  Risks  

The  indistinguishable  and  intertwined  use  between  military  and  civilian  space  asset  applications 
poses a key challenge to monitoring and regulating space (Moon, 2017, p. 4). Currently, around 40 
percent of active orbit space asset are military satellites or contain some sort of military application. 
The integration of dual-use objects is not necessarily a vulnerability, 

“as long as commercial equipment is designed to military standards and is secure. However, 
if military standards are not met, items procured from commercial industry with design flaws 
may expose NATO’s systems to additional vulnerabilities” (Unal, 2019, p. 8). 

Thereby, Wells and Sielaff add that 

“there is a whole series of protection measures that are completely different from commercial 
systems but must be included in military space systems, such as anti-jamming and -spoofing 
capabilities,  or  designing  the  space  assets  to  specifically  protect  the  data,  which  includes 
commands being transmitted from the spacecraft” (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). 

Commercial space assets are being considered a high-value and easily breakable target, as military 
space  assets  are  typically  designed  more  carefully  (Hallex  &  Cottom,  2020,  p.  22).  In  case  of 

41 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

exploiting such dual-use space asset vulnerabilities, hostile state and non-state actors could track and 
subsequently attack targets with heightened effectiveness. 

This  is  aggravated  by  a  lack  of  awareness  and  understanding,  with  MS  governments  rather 
emphasizing on ensuring data availability and compatibility in the field, and thus having a warfighter 
perspective. This is where the military in the field would be less concerned about a data’s source but 
rather  making  sure  “that  it  is  a)  coming,  b)  not  going  to  be  interrupted,  and  c)  not  going  to  be 
corrupted  or  interfered  with”  (Bander  et  al.,  2020).  Underscoring  this,  Conti  states  that  with  the 
increasing  involvement  of  commercial  technology,  requirements  for  NATO  technicians  changed. 
Whilst  in  the  past,  technicians  were  required  to  possess  specific  knowledge  and  understanding  of 
modems used such as for ICT or air conditioning, increasingly, the expertise need has become solely 
about operating such assets: “we don’t touch the equipment anymore. If something is wrong, we take 
it, we pack it, and send it back to the company instead of fixing it by ourselves” (Conti, 2020). This 
causes  long-term  reliance  on  the  asset’s  vendor  for  security  issues.  Falco  criticises  the  “limited 
visibility  that  militaries  have  into  the  parts  that  the  space  asset  is  composed  of”  (Falco,  2020). 
However, there is in contrast too little concern to increase vetting of suppliers or restrict outsourcing 
of critical functions.  

Potential attacks on space assets throughout their SC might include the substitution of hardware or 
software components by counterfeit parts, implementing security backdoors by software vendors or 
execute invisible changes during the manufacturing (Falco, 2018a; Unal, 2019). Past examples of so-
caused cyber SASC incidents exist: in 1998, the US-German ROSAT X-Ray satellite was hacked by 
infiltrating  computer  systems  at  the  US  Maryland  Goddard  Space  Flight  Centre,  instructing  the 
satellite to direct its solar panels directly towards the sun, hence burning out its batteries and leaving 
the satellite defunct (Akoto, 2020, p. 4). In 1999, hackers took control of the UK ‘s SkyNet satellites, 
holding  it  for  ransom.  Over  recent  years,  cyberattacks  on  space  assets  became  more  recurrent:  in 
2008, hackers, suspected to be Chinese, reportedly took full control over two NASA satellites for two 
to nine minutes (Akoto, 2020, p. 5). In 2018, another group of reportedly Chinese and Iranian state-
backed hackers attacked defence contractors and space asset operators. In June 2020, ZDNet reported 
the DopplePaymer ransomware gang to have a breached DMI, one of NASA’s IT contractors and a 
major  US  IT  and  cybersecurity  provider,  through  having  infected  its  networks  via  a  SC  contractor 
(Cimpanu,  2020,  p.  1).  Whilst  it  seems  to  be  still  unclear  how  deep  networks  were  breached,  it 
appears  that  the  DopplePaymer  gang  achieved  to  breach  DMI's  NASA-related  infrastructure  and 
obtain  NASA-related  files.  The  group  boasted  about  its  breach  by  publicly  posting  twenty  NASA 
archive  files,  revealing  details  on  project  plans,  Human  Resource  (HR)  documents  including 
employee details matching public LinkedIn profiles. Furthermore, it posted a comprehensive list of 
workstations being part of DMI's internal network, which the ransomware gang encrypted and hold 
for ransom. 

5.2.2  Competitiveness Leading to Insufficient Cybersecurity Controls 

NATO  MS  may  profit  from  increased  space  capacity  when  outsourcing  to  the  commercial  sector, 
however they do so in exchange for loss of control (Bander et al., 2020). This is rooted in  

a)  Cost  minimisation:  security  issues  may  be  caused  by  pursuing  a  traditional  outsourcing 
approach,  thus  procuring  the  lowest-cost  option  at  a  still-acceptable  quality  (Bratton,  2020b, 
pp.  2-6).  This  approach  is  likely  to  cause  a  trade-off  in  SASC  reliability  and  built-in 
cybersecurity measures. 

42 

 
 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

b)  Competition race between nation states: In 2020, the US Cybersecurity Solarium Commission 
acknowledged  that  MS  fell  so  far  behind  Chinese  Tech  Industry  leaders,  that  regaining 
competitiveness and competence may become impossible (CSC, 2020, p. 119). To solve this 
challenge,  governments  strive  to  collaborate  with  large  prime  contractors,  small  to  medium 
sized companies and subcontractors (CSC, 2020, pp. 8-10). Also, this is driven by the desire to 
deter through strongly competing with for example Russian and Chinese actors (Moon, 2017, 
p.  3):  the  US  and  other  Western  actors,  as  well  as  China’s  Aerospace  Science  and  Industry 
Corporation,  Russia  and  India  are  actively  developing  own  small  satellite  projects  in 
partnership  with  commercial  suppliers  to  access  more  innovative  and  effective  space  asset-
enabled services (Hallex & Cottom, 2020, pp. 4/ 23).  

Hence,  NATO  becomes  more  dependent  on  space  assets  to  retrieve  ever  better  ISR,  process  and 
analysis information and stay competitive (Baram, 2020). Thereby, Widmann states that outsourcing 
“is  the  better  way  to  get  innovations  for  militaries.  However,  the  time  to  actually  go  through  the 
acquisition  process  for  new  emerging  technologies  puts  NATO  at  a  disadvantage  to  adversarial 
nations”  (Widmann,  2020).  He  points  to  the  increasing  military  trade-off  between  thorough  risk 
analysis  and  resource  investment,  since  vetting  items  is  time-consuming  and  expensive  once 
procured from a commercial vendor (Widmann, 2020). Hence, Livingstone criticises that in this rush 
to  tune  military  and  intelligence  space  assets,  dependency  on  the  civilian  sector  steadily  increases. 
Even  though  it  might  be  acceptable  to  delegate  some  of  the  space-asset  requirements  to  civilian 
capacities,  governments  must  be  aware  that  these  are  “not  nearly  as  secure  as  your  military  and 
intelligence space capacities” (D. Livingstone, 2020). As an example, Falco states that even in 2017, 
NASA’s laboratory used to work with a catalogue of asset parts for science exploration projects with 
factories mostly located in China and containing Chinese-manufactured codes.  

On  the    commercial  side,  companies  do  “not  only  supply  products  to  governments,  but  they  also 
compete  commercially”  (US  DIA,  2019,  p.  7),  leading  to  a  trade-off  of  cybersecurity  controls. 
Caudill  also  points  to  CIA  of  data  being  disregarded  by  many  military  space  asset  developers  and 
suppliers:  

“small  space  asset  operators  do  not  really  care  about  CIA.  In  contrast,  state  actors  do  and 
should  care  because  of  competition:  you  don't  want  another  nation  state  to  be  able  to hack 
your weather or GPS satellite constellation” (Caudill, 2020).  

In  consequence,  targeting  space  assets  is  more  easily  facilitated  than  ever  before  (Lister,  2020b), 
“with  the  wider  availability  of  lower  cost,  small  satellites  and  with  the  prospect  of  large 
constellations consisting of thousands of satellites [,] technological and cost barriers have fallen” (US 
DIA, 2019, p. 7). Such market forces pressure many companies into cutting costs and speeding up 
production and development - at the cost of suppressing cybersecurity concerns (Akoto, 2020, pp. 1-
8). Hence, 

“the private sector’s motivation at the end of the day is to make profit, which is misaligned 
with the cause of the federal government or cooperating states to secure space initiatives for 
all of their citizens when outsourcing ideas, technology and products” (Lister, 2020b). 

Additionally, since technical capabilities steadily lower in price, the market opens to a broader range 
of  customers,  and  hence  potential  cyber  threat  actors,  whilst  security  controls  of  the  cyber  SASC 
decrease  (Livingstone,  2020).  This  becomes  a  risk  to  NATO,  as  “we  now  have  commercially 
available software such as hacking tools on the market, being updated every day, that make it easier 
to  target  space  based  assets  and  the  GS  that  control  them”  (Lister,  2020b).  Finally,  Lee  (2020) 
criticises that “even renowned companies are famous for doing things very economically, trading off 

43 

 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

the consideration of cybersecurity safety when adapting terrestrial components to space applications 
[and thus] cutting a significant corner in cybersecurity”.  

5.2.3  Classification Misalignment Leading to Lacking Cooperation  

MS classification restrictions frequently hinder support to NATO operations. As outlined in AJP-3.3, 
since many space systems are determined by complex relationships, 

“preparatory  planning  and  agreements  should  be  in  place  […]  made  as  transparent  as 
possible  to  the  supported  commander  [to]  provide  clarity  of  the  relationships  to  NATO 
strategic  and  operational  commands  and  clearly  define  the  process  for  requesting  and 
disseminating the products and/or services” (NSO, 2016, p. 5-9/-10). 

However, there is “no one overarching framework that covers both cybersecurity and SC, as each MS 
will have its own classification approach” (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). As agreed upon by Wells, Sielaff 
and  Vasen,  the  core  problem  is  with  the  challenge  of  exchanging  data,  for  example  by  using 
diverging formatting of data encryption (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). Silverstein points out that  

“unfortunately,  sharing  and  consultation  do  not  address  the  alliance’s  most  conspicuous 
vulnerabilities  in  space  […]  Notably,  some  NATO  allies  have  reservations  about  ceding 
control  of  space  systems  to  foreign  commanders  during  a  crisis.  This  might  drive  NATO 
members away from beneficial redundancies and toward inefficient replication” (Silverstein, 
2020, p. 5). 

Such redundancies are needed to maintain multiple ways of communication, to ensure resiliency if 
systems are attacked or need to be suppressed occasionally for covert military operations (T. Vasen, 
2020).  This  includes  making  use  of  multiple  navigation  system  providers,  such  as  the  EU’s 
GALILEO  and  other  GNSS  in  addition  to  US  GPS.  In  regards  to  NATO’s  new  Space  Policy, it  is 
unclear if “the current NATO space ecosystem is adequately layered with redundancies to realize the 
benefits […] a dearth of sophisticated redundancies would make those capabilities - unsupported by 
substitute systems as they are - valuable targets” (Silverstein, 2020, p. 5). 

Both  Heren  and  Vasen  specify  that  such  classification  restrictions  cause  compatibility  and 
collaboration issues, hindering operating at the required speed of a given operation. Thereby, Wells 
points to standard frequency bands being used by several European countries as well as Russia and 
China,  and  thus  allowing  for  a  common  set  of  interoperability  and  sharing  tools.  In  turn,  when 
creating  a  single  network,  the  risk  for  a  cyberattack’s  impact  increases  due  to  heightened 
interconnectedness  (Bates,  2020,  p.  4).  Hence,  NATO  MS  military  forces  tend  to  remain  with 
operating  different  data  protection  and  segmentation  regimes  of  classified  and  unclassified  data  on 
computer  systems  (Heren,  2020).  This  is  reinforced  by  segmentation  not  being  a  required  standard 
throughout  the  private  cyber  SASC.  In  sum,  this  leads  to  a  lack  of  control  by  NATO  over  the 
integrity and source of data and how information is processed. 

5.2.3.1  Intelligence 

For NATO and its MS, it is especially difficult to share actionable threat intelligence with acquisition 
companies  as  the  central  challenge  “is  to  protect  sources  and  methods”  (Eversden,  2020,  p.  1). 
Hence, intelligence sharing requires trust, whose establishment and maintenance 

“is a long-term commitment being hard to do, not just from government to commercial, but 
as  well  between  governments.  We  don't  like  to  reveal  sources,  methods  and  tactics  in  the 

44 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

intelligence community for a good reason, but yet there has got to be a way in which we are 
able to share more vital, actionable intelligence, especially for cyber” (Yingst, 2020). 

Furthermore, Yingst states that 

“many times, commercial vendors are reluctant to reveal information because they are afraid 
of either attribution, giving up proprietary information or potentially being penalised if they 
are  perceived  to  be  in  violation  of  a  regulation.  We  have  to  develop  that  trust  between 
governments and commercial vendors, as there has to be a sense of safety and security that 
what companies are sharing is for the mutual benefit of both parties, and that they are going 
to be protected” (Yingst, 2020). 

Insider  threats  are  the  main  concern  to  not  share  intelligence:  both  Wells  and  Sielaff  criticise  that 
only  a  handful  of  people  in  crucial  space  asset  companies  are  cleared.  As  stated  by  Sielaff, 
“companies can and should protect themselves technically and physically, but in the end, if someone 
inside the SC leaks sensitive information, intelligence gets exposed” (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). Hence, 
Yingst points to the importance of increasing the issuing of security clearances to “enable a great deal 
more  open  discussion  to  take  place”  (Yingst,  2020),  as  NATO  operates  based  on  a  need-to-know 
policy. This includes information sharing “only if the employee has a need-to-know to perform his or 
her  job”  (NATO  ACT,  2019)  and  is  detailed  in  C-M(2002)49:  Security  Within  the  North  Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation: 

“classified information shall be disseminated solely on the basis of the principle of need-to-
know to individuals who have been briefed on the relevant security procedures; in addition, 
only 
information  classified 
CONFIDENTIAL and above” (NATO, 2002, p. 9). 

shall  have  access 

security  cleared 

individuals 

to 

However, “it costs a lot of money for these companies to have security clearances” (Yingst, 2020). 
As governments oftentimes do not possess sufficient manpower, and clearing processes are typically 
stretched  over  an  extended  period  of  time,  which  “poses  an  opportunity  for  adversaries  to  start 
recruiting”  (Wells  &  Sielaff,  2020).  Across  the  board,  interviewees  state  that  the  level  of  security 
needs to be increased through implementing more management and access controls, higher levels of 
clearance  for  personnel  handling  more  sensitive  data,  and  a  greater  number  of  background  checks 
within the government to establish confidence in SC partners (Yingst, 2020). 

5.2.4  Lacking Legal Regulation 

As  stated  by  Caudill,  New  Space  is  growing  rapidly,  whilst  few  security  measures  and  even  less 
enforced  regulations  are  in  place  (Caudill,  2020).  Thereby,  dual-use  objects  are  being  with  more 
difficulty  legally  identified  as  legitimate  military  objects  and  thus  face  fewer  security  restrictions 
(NSO,  2016b).  Worsening,  private  space  asset  component  providers  are  reluctant  to  regulate  their 
SCs, as players are seeking flexible options to ensure workflows and keep costs low (Baugh, 2020, 
pp. 1-7). As stated by Lister,  

“we  could  assume  that  there  are  stringent  governmental  cybersecurity  controls  in  place  for 
those  companies  building  sophisticated  space-based  assets.  However,  what  we  have  seen 
with regulations so far in 2020 is that there has not been a specific guidance on what exactly 
this should look like, for example, whether or not the providers should be encrypting all the 
satellite  links,  or  any  other  specific  guidance  on  securing  sensitive  or  operational  data” 
(Lister, 2020b). 

45 

 
 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

This causes several political and regulatory issues. Silverstein notes that 

“NATO members may not have comparable capacities to observe or monitor space activities, 
leaving allies unable to assess independently collected data […] Without common methods 
or an established procedure for space observation and shared threat-assessment tools, NATO 
may  be  unable  to  arrive  at  a  conclusion  and  may  cede  initiative  back  to  an  adversary” 
(Silverstein, 2020, p. 7). 

Due  to  lacking  intergovernmental  cyber  SC  standards,  private  space  asset  suppliers  remain 
responsible  for  their  own  cybersecurity,  which  leads  to  complacency,  a  lack  of  clarity  on 
responsibility and liability in case of cyber breaches, and hence missing cybersecurity efforts (Falco, 
2018b, pp. 11-12). Therefore, analysts have begun “to advocate for strong government involvement 
in  the  development  and  regulation  of  cybersecurity  standards  for  satellites  and  other  space  assets” 
(Akoto, 2020, p. 7). However, the pace of doing so remains low.  

Furthermore, a major concern amongst scholars and practitioners is COTS regulation along the cyber 
SASC  (Akoto,  2020;  Falco,  2018b;  Koch  &  Golling,  2016;  Ziolkowski  et  al.,  2013).  As  stated  by 
UNOOSA,  SmallSat  missions  “are  not  always  conducted  in  full  compliance  with  international 
obligations,  regulations  and  relevant  voluntary  guidelines  [,]  due  to  inexperience  or  unfamiliarity 
with  the  national  and  international  regulatory  framework“  (UNOOSA,  2015,  p.  3).  Thereby,  Falco 
states that it is impossible to simply apply already existing cybersecurity frameworks, as SmallSats 
are much more complicated in their technological structure than other space assets.  

Within  NATO,  regulation  and  strategic  NATO  guidance  of  SC  cybersecurity  for  space  assets  is, 
beyond minor space-related subjects, nearly non-existent because it follows the individual regulations 
of the operating nation (Vasen, 2020b). In AJP-3.20, NATO emphasised on the need to further 

“protect or ensure the continued function and resilience of capabilities and assets, including 
[…]  supply  chains  critical  to  the  execution  of  NATO  mission-essential  functions  in  any 
operating environment or condition” (NSO, 2020, p. 4). 

Due to bureaucracy and high classification restrictions between MS, it remains difficult for NATO to 
align MS positions on space asset security (Vasen, 2020). As stated by Falco, 

“every  country  is  currently  pursuing  their  own  version  of  different  standards  for  security 
systems,  either  because  of  nationalism  or  because  of  national  security  concerns.  However, 
space needs an international perspective for innovation and scientific exploration. We need to 
have  a  standard  platform  fully  vetted  by  the  community  to  provide  diligence  for  security 
frameworks” (Falco, 2020). 

5.2.5  Lacking Awareness  

At the strategic level, Livingston criticises the high degree of stove-pipe thinking within the military 
sector,  being  the  restricted  holistic  view  and  vertical  flow  of  information  when  considering  the 
security of data delivered from space assets (Livingstone, 2020). This lack of reporting and dialogue 
is aggravated by a high degree of military bureaucracy. As criticized by Lee, the military space asset 
sector 

“is very regimented and locked down. When you start having any conversations with people 
who  are  in  charge  of  building  military  or  intelligence  satellites,  they  feel  like  they  have 
cybersecurity completely under control” (Lee, 2020). 

46 

 
 
 
Chapter 5: NATO Space Asset Cyber Supply Chain 

This is underscored by the current state of military stove-pipe system across NATO and MS, which 
leads to limited agility and prevents “to effectively exchange information [which] has been a long-
time weakness in the acquisition of MILSATCOM systems” (US Space Force & US Air Force, 2020, 
p. 8). Referring to recent operational NATO exercises like the Trident series, Widmann doubts that 
awareness  of  SC  threats  was  operationally  trained  as  much  as  it  could  have  been,  including  the 
strategic planning process that it takes to secure a SC. Moreover, further security vulnerabilities are 
caused  by  the  fundamental  difference  between  the  high  speed  of  cyberattacks  as  opposed  to  the 
reaction  speed  of  MS  governments  and  military  entities.  This  is  aggravated  by  the  vast  volume  of 
data  received  on  a  day-to-day  basis  from  space  assets.  This  makes  it  difficult  for  the  military  to 
determine if, to what extent, and at what point of the SC, MS may have been compromised (Tucker, 
2019).  Livingstone  points  out  that  “there  is  a  less  than  perfect  understanding  of  governments  and 
space asset manufacturers of SC threats” (Livingstone, 2020). This enables cyber criminals to corrupt 
reliability  and  accuracy  of  data  with  a  low  probability  of  being  discovered  (Livingstone  &  Lewis, 
2016).  

As NATO does not operate its own satellites but is depending on MS’ capabilities, it does not have 
any  oversight  but  only  receives  data,  products  and  services  from  the  nations  (Heren,  2020). 
Regarding NCIA, Conti states that it is difficult for NCIA to keep the overview over the high number 
of companies NATO deals with, especially for an individual security officer. Yingst and Lister stress 
the  problem  of  managing  an  uncontrollable  number  of  supplier  tiers 77 ,  especially  if  those  are 
circumventing due diligence processes. Lister emphasises on this obscurity of the SASC, making it 
highly attractive to hackers:  

“A  lot  of  manufacturers  use  very  specialised  technologies  procured  through  an  unknown 
number  of  manufacturers,  and  an  unknown  number  of  integrators,  opening  an  unknown 
number of opportunities for attackers to gain access. Not all companies even understand from 
where  their  developers  are  pulling  information  from.  So  that's  very  concerning  from  an 
operational standpoint” (Lister, 2020b). 

Yuval also points to market failure due to a lack of  

“uniform  language  [as]  most  customers  develop  alone;  poor  maintenance;  one  size  fits  all; 
difficulty  to  manage  the  process  [as]  resources  are  often  lacking;  limited  scope  of  testing; 
lack of technical knowhow; and lack of responsiveness of suppliers“ (Yuval, 2019, pp. 3-5). 

The ongoing COVID pandemic has exposed further SC volatilities within the space industry, such as 
product  shortages  or  lagging  timelines  (Lister,  2020,  pp.  2-5).  As  the  pandemic  proceeds,  the  US 
Pentagon is discussing space SC concerns, especially for commercial start-ups, smaller suppliers, and 
other non-traditional defence industry contractors. Thus, Lister states that 

“from  an  outsourcing  perspective  on  the  cyber  SC,  the  pandemic  puts  new  pressure  on  the 
space community to find and locate vulnerabilities, conduct supplier due diligence or identify 
alternative suppliers that meet quality and quantity timelines. This temps some companies to 
circumvent supplier due diligence in order to save time and resources” (Lister, 2020b). 

77 Tiers: In a SC, a tier one company is “the most important member […] tier two companies supply companies in tier one; 
tier three supplies tier two, and so on. Tiered supply chains are common in industries such as aerospace […] where the final

5.2.6  Understaffing and Lacking National Financial Resources 

Handling security of data and services retrieved from or transmitted through NATO MS space assets 
remains complicated due to significant understaffing. Thereby, processes can be significantly delayed 
as SpSC is manned with only one single permanent SME, hence being incapable to operate in a 24/7 
availability (Vasen, 2020, pp. 23-25). Moreover, on the tactical level, no permanent SpSC has been 
foreseen, even though TRJE18 showed a clear demand for at least one tactical Space SME both in 
times of conflict and peace. Such an expert is needed to educate, advise, and train HQ representatives 
on  space  support  limitations.  Whilst  there  exists  a  need  to  stock  up  the  current  total  20  dedicated 
NATO staff to at least 150 positions, at present a lot of positions are double or triple hatted between 
air,  cyber  and  space  divisions.  These  organizational  structures  create  disjointed  units  that  are 
unequipped  with  regard  to  the  right  level  of  expertise,  experience  or  training  (Heren,  2020).  This 
issue  is  aggravated  by  most  relevant  NATO  MS  currently  prioritizing  their  own  space  capabilities 
and  internal  reorganisation  and  hence  hesitating  to  contribute  rare,  specialized  personnel  to  NATO 
(Vasen, 2020). However, with the creation of a new NATO Space Centre at Ramstein, it is safe to 
assume that an yet undecided number of additional Space professionals will be added to the NATO 
Command  Structure  (Heren,  2020).  Furthermore,  such  a  centre  will,  once  established  and  fully 
staffed, close the 24/7 gap in the NATO SpSC functionality. 

Additionally, NATO MS are not equal in terms of financial capability to secure SASC cybersecurity. 
Zarkan  (2020)  points  to  the  challenge  for  states  and  companies  to  invest  enough  money  into  the 
development  of  secure  space  assets,  and  to  finance  technology  and  research.  The  high  costs  of 
guaranteeing each component’s security may be prohibitive for companies to make cybersecurity a 
high priority, which therefore might be ready to take the risk of keeping poor protection and facing 
the consequences. Especially since the start of the COVID pandemic,  

“smaller suppliers and commercial space companies may not have infinite resources focused 
on cybersecurity. There is the concern that these companies will start circumventing any due 
diligence  processes  for  their  SC  and  their  vendors,  driving  the  need  for  prioritising  risk 
management  on  hardware  and  software  services  and  the  people  that  support  both”  (Lister, 
2020b). 

As stated by Timm, the most difficult challenge is to get lower SC tiers to comply with cybersecurity 
requirements, since, even if companies may get reimbursed for cybersecurity costs over the course of 
a governmental contract, this may take several years (Bander et al., 2020). Thus, smaller companies 
lack the incentive to enhance security efforts and prevent vulnerabilities (CSC, 2020, pp. 8-10). This 
is  more  so  the  case  for  low-cost  space  operations  during  which  the  cost  of  implementing 
cybersecurity might exceed cost of COTS components itself. As stated by Caudill, “nobody along the 
way has the financial intention to secure the cyber side of space missions” (Caudill, 2020). 

5.3  Summary 

Numerous cyber intrusion opportunities threaten the delivery and integrity of NATO mission-critical 
data. These are caused by the involvement of manifold suppliers and manufacturers along the cyber 
SASC.  Outsourcing  to  such  external  public  and  private  companies  is  needed  to  stay  competitive, 
deterring and up to date with innovative technology enhancing the outcome of NATO’s operations to

standards” (Linton, 2019).

the  best  possible  extent.  Cybersecurity  threats  are  aggravated  by  the  increasing  obscurity  of  SCs, 
easing  the  implementation  of  third-party  vulnerabilities  into  relevant  soft-  and  hardware.  Driving 
causes behind such threats are:

The  following  and  final  chapter  aims  at  identifying  policy  recommendations  to  reduce  such 
vulnerabilities and gaps in NATO’s handling of its cyber SASC, as identified through the preceding 
literature and field research. 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

6  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS  

As  outlined  by  NATO  Secretary  General  (SG)  Stoltenberg,  NATO’s  new  Space  Policy  will  allow 
NATO  to  leverage  its  collective  MS’  portfolio  “of  space-based  technologies  to  supplement  lost 
capabilities and negate adversarial interference with space systems” (NATO, 2019). Stoltenberg also 
states that the Space Policy enables NATO to establish a MS consultation and conversation forum, 
formally within NATO and informally between its MS (NATO, 2019). Through these efforts, NATO 
lives up to its goal to provide cooperative security and collective defence to its MS regarding space 
and  cyberspace-related  challenges  (Baram  &  Wechsler,  2020,  pp.  5-6).  Livingstone  underlines  the 
solidity of the NATO alliance over the past 70 years, “which makes it an established, preformatted, 
trusted  alliance.  NATO  provides  the  required  platform  to  invite  all  those  concerned  in  the 
governmental  and  commercial  space  asset  sector,  instead  of  creating  some  new  cooperation 
platform” (Livingstone, 2020). 

Based  on  these  conclusions,  NATO  should  consider  two  major  collaboration  initiatives:  a)  Raising 
Awareness  throughout  the  whole  of  the  NATO  system,  and  b)  Pushing  forward  the  creation  of 
Regulation  through  a  standardized  NATO  security  framework  on  SASC  cybersecurity.  Doing  so 
would allow NATO and its MS to recognise cyberthreats to mission-critical data earlier on along its 
SASC.  Furthermore,  a  standardized  NATO  security  framework  would  allow  the  alignment  of 
working language, external and internal assessments, as well as incident reporting and knowledge on 
risks,  vulnerabilities  and  consequences  (Widmann,  2020).  The  following  chapter  aims  at  detailing 
those  approaches  further,  transforming  them  into  concrete  policy  recommendations  for  NATO,  its 
MS and private sector entities. 

6.1  Awareness 

6.1.1  Initiate Intersectoral Collaboration 

As  emphasised  on  by  Falco,  international  collaboration  is  crucial  for  designing  safe  space  and 
streamlining differing security and ethical standards between countries. Thereby, Falco states that  

“it  seems  like  none  of  the  international  bodies  that  we  have  today  are  effective  in 
coordinating such efforts, but there needs to be international communication because if not 
geographically defined systems in space are attacked, there is potential for hostile impact on 
everybody” (Falco, 2020; see 4.2.5). 

Urban  (2020)  also  designates  commercial  and  governmental  cooperation  across  borders  as 
compulsory and inevitable to remain competitive. Using NATO as a collaboration platform on cyber 
SASC security would allow for an inclusive and comprehensive approach due to its transatlantic MS: 
European  MS  rely  heavily  on  US  industry-produced  space  technologies  and  components.  Trans-
Atlantic agreements and interoperability may be eased through NATO, mediating, and coordinating 
security efforts, common compliance, and standards. Unal points to the NATO as the  

“fastest and least expensive ways to increase […] cyber resilience, improve incident handling 
and  mitigate  vulnerability  to  attacks  [which]  should  foster  timely  information-sharing  on 
cyberthreats, allowing stakeholders to enhance situational awareness and better protect their 

50 

 
 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

networks  [and]  facilitate  rapid  and  early  bilateral  exchange  of  non-classified  technical 
information related to cyberthreats and vulnerabilities” (Unal, 2019, p. 26), 

Thus, NATO should advance the creation of an effective multi-stakeholder approach that includes as 
many as possible public and private sector SASC partners (Akoto, 2020, p. 7; Unal, 2019, p. 26). As 
stated by Lister, the community of MS and private space asset companies 

“is  not  going  to  be  able  to  prevent  targeting  of  their  systems,  but  it  can  proactively  work 
together to prevent, detect and prepare for how to respond to those incidents, by developing 
resources such as white papers and working groups focused on how emerging technologies 
can  help  protect  the  space  community  from  cyber  incidents  which  provide  their  cyber  SC 
perspective, as currently there is a lack of care and coherent rules to help ensure that supply 
risk management is consistent” (Lister, 2020b). 

This  should  include  at  least  one  annual  Cyber  SASC  Risk  Management78 symposium,  involving  SC 
executive representatives from both the commercial and governmental side to exchange on practical 
recommendations, status updates, current challenges, and estimated organizational impact of attacks 
(NIST, 2020, pp. 8-13). Furthermore, this includes sharing organizational best practices to identify, 
respond to and prioritize cyber SC risks, ensure cyber resilience and minimize SC incident impact on 
services  (NIST,  2020,  pp.  9-13).  These  symposiums  should  be  led  by  NATO’s  Industry  Advisory 
Group (NIAG), NATO’s Industry Cyber Partnership (NCIP) as well as the NDPP MS Delegations 
and  SME’s  to  facilitate  the  incorporation  of  results.  The  NATO  Parliamentary  Assembly  Defence 
and Security Committee (PA DSC) and the Board of Directors of commercial organizations, at least 
of more crucial tiers, should be involved to increase the cyber SC literacy of executives. Lister states 
that such recurring events would pave the way to achieve an uniform, high quality SC security, with 
NATO  and  its  data  suppliers  continuously  coaching  each  other  up-  and  downstream  and  sharing 
lessons learned from SC incidents (Lister, 2020b). 

Intersectoral  collaboration  should  emphasise  on  establishing  further  PPPs  along  the  SASC.  As  an 
incentive, “there has to be a cost-benefit to both sides, they have to see or feel that there is going to 
be a return on investment to build up trust” (Yingst, 2020). The first efforts are in progress. In June 
2020, the Germany-based aerospace, maritime and cyber IT solutions company AMC Solutions held 
a virtual event on Governance and Security in Outer Space, gathering approximately 60 participants 
from 25 nations including NATO’s CCDCOE (Space and Cybersecurity Project Group et al., 2020, 
p. 1). Thereby, participants acknowledged the connection between risks from cyber and outer space, 
current  trends  in  security,  governance  and  sustainability,  and  stability  in  space.  Additionally, 
participants recognized the need for more open collaboration through starting to create internationally 
agreed documents, such as law, comprehensive frameworks and guidelines linking cyber and outer 
space, as well as a platform to discuss risk mitigation and jurisdiction in outer space. Subsequently, 
appropriate  international  collaboration  platforms  bringing  together  public  and  private  space  asset 
suppliers will be introduced as potential cyber SASC collaboration partners for NATO. 

78 CSCRM is defined as “a systematic process for managing [cyber] SC risks by identifying susceptibilities, vulnerabilities, 
and  threats  throughout  the  SC  and  developing  mitigation  strategies  to  combat  those  threats  whether  presented  by  the 
supplier, the product and its subcomponents, or the SC itself” (CSC, 2020, p. 138).

6.1.1.1  US Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) 

Following  Galer,  another  cooperation  partner  could  be  the  US-based  Aerospace  Industries 
Association  (AIA),  representing  manufacturers  and  suppliers  of  civil,  military,  and  business  space 
systems,  aircraft,  and  related  equipment,  services,  and  IT,  beneath  others.  It  aligns  its  member 
companies  interests,  from  the  biggest  primes  down  to  the  individual  supplier  level,  and  provides 
more  education  and  understanding  on  the  growing  interest  on  the  nexus  between  space  and  SC 
security (Bander et al., 2020). Therein, following Timm, the AIA Cybersecurity Committee handles 
defence acquisition matters, beneath others for the DOD. It mostly analyses the infrastructure of the 
company,  thus access  to  the  networks,  physical  security  and  protection  of  intellectual  property  and 
aims at securing the SC, the actual product, and the mission systems themselves (see 6.2). 

6.1.1.2  CCSDS and ISO  

The  Consultative  Committee  for  Space  Data  Systems  (CCSDS),  currently  consisting  of  eleven 
member agencies, 140 industrial associates and twenty-eight observer agencies, was formed in 1982 
“by the major space agencies of the world to provide a forum for discussion of common problems in 
the development and operation of space data systems” (CCSDS, 2020a). This includes the  

•  Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), Italy; 

•  Canadian Space Agency (CSA), Canada; 

•  Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), France; 

•  China National Space Administration (CNSA); 

•  Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), Germany; 

•  European Space Agency (ESA); 

• 

Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Japan; 

•  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), US; 

•  National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil; 

•  Russian Federal Space Agency (RFSA); 

•  UK Space Agency. 

Its  aim  is  to  actively  develop  “recommendations  for  data-  and  information-systems  standards  to 
promote  interoperability  […  and]  reduce  the  cost  burden  of  spaceflight  missions  by  allowing  cost 
sharing between agencies and cost-effective commercialization” (CCSDS, 2020a).  

CCSDS cooperates since 1990 with the International Standards Organization (ISO), an international 
non-governmental  organization  based  in  Geneva,  Switzerland,  bringing  together  165  national 
standards  bodies  and  “experts  to  share  knowledge  and  develop  voluntary,  consensus-based,  market 
relevant  International  Standards”  (ISO,  2020).  In  collaboration,  ISO  and  CCSDS  formed  the  ISO 
Technical  Committee  20  Subcommittee  13  [ISO  TC  20/SC  13]  on  designated  “Space  Data  and 
Information Transfer Systems”, to allow “completed CCSDS standards to be processed and approved 
as  ISO  standards”  (CCSDS,  2020b).  NATO  should  profit  from  this  established  platform  on  inter-
governmental policy making and start collaborating on interoperable space asset regulations (see 6.2)

6.1.1.3  Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) 

Yingst  emphasises  on  collaborating  with  sector-specific  Information  Sharing  and  Analysis  Centres 
(ISACs)  to  be  able  to  share  sensitive  information,  bringing  together  national  cybersecurity 
information coordination centres as well as representatives from various private sectors. As defined 
by the EU Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), ISACs are 

“non-profit  organizations  that  provide  a  central  resource  for  gathering  information  on 
cyberthreats  (in  many  cases  to  critical  infrastructure)  as  well  as  allow  two-way  sharing  of 
information between the private and the public sector” (ENISA, 2020a, p. 7). 

In  2019,  a  new  Space  ISAC  was  sponsored  and  launched  by  US  NASA,  the  US  National 
Reconnaissance  Centre  and  US  Space  Force  (Space  ISAC,  2020).  On  the  international  side,  SES 
became a founding member, being already connected to NATO via LuxGovSat and thus offering an 
eased opportunity to start partnering (see 3.2.3). Thereby, the Space ISAC considers SC concerns as 
a research priority, whilst Erin Miller, VP of Operations, states that one of the Space ISAC’s primary 
objectives 

“is to give its members, no matter how small they are, access to current threat intelligence, as 
not all have the resources to do it by themselves [whereas] we have started efforts to manage 
security  in  the  supply  chains  and  develop  recommendations  on  policies,  standards  and 
security requirements” (Miller, 2020). 

Such access to cyberthreat intelligence is oftentimes important to increase companies’ awareness of 
vulnerabilities  in  the  first  place.  The  documentation  of  cooperation  outcomes  will  be  divided  into 
confidential  and  public,  as  decided  by  the  Space  ISAC’s  members,  which  allows  to  share  more 
confidential information. Additionally, Miller points to the Space ISACs member-exclusive Priority 
Intelligence  Requirements  Document,  identifying  current  threats  and  adversaries  and  creating  a 
“high-trust environment that has to exist in an ISAC for making it successful and create a common 
understanding”  (Miller,  2020).  Information  is  shared  via  a  common  online  threat  intelligence 
platform, in member meetings, alerts and reports around threats, which are released at a partnership 
level.  This  is  complemented  by  a  strong  vetting  process  of  potential  ISAC  members,  to  ensure  the 
highest possible level of trust between partners. 

6.1.1.4  CERTs, CSIRTs and ENISA 

As recommended by Widmann, NATO should start collaborating and unifying specific cyberthreat 
intelligence centres such as Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) from different countries. 
CERTs are defined as internationally distributed coordination centres responsible for “analyzing and 
reducing  cyberthreats,  vulnerabilities,  disseminating  cyberthreat  warning 
information,  and 
coordinating incident response activities” (CISA, 2020b). This should include the permanent CERT 
for the EU institutions (CERT-EU) and the US National CERT (NCERT) to work with each other on 
one platform, making SC protection an intelligence priority (Widmann, 2020). Additionally, EU MS 
are assisted by ENISA with the establishment and maintenance of currently more than 500 business 
Computer  Security  Incident  Response  Teams  (CSIRT)  to  spur  proactive  detection,  prevention,  and 
analysis  of  general  cybersecurity  threats  and  incidents  (ENISA,  2020,  pp.  4-5;  Vasen,  2020).  This 
effort  aims  “to  contribute  to  developing  confidence  and  trust  between  the  Member  States  and  to 
promote swift and effective operational cooperation” (ENISA, 2018), and strengthen the EU’s overall 
cyber  resilience.  Additionally,  ENISA  gathers  information  on  currently  used  or  planned  incident 
response  implementation,  available  measures  and  future  growth  and  improvement  areas.  Hence, 

53 

 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

ENISA  aims  to  close  gaps  in  tooling,  differing  data  formats  or  standards  in  the  interaction  of 
different MS systems. 

6.1.1.5  Orbital Security Alliance (OSA) 

The Orbital Security Alliance (OSA) was formed to fill the gap of lacking cybersecurity guidelines 
for  the  space  industry  and  create  a  common  understanding  of  cybersecurity  incidents  in  space 
(Orbital Security Alliance, 2020, p. 1). Therefore, it brings together representatives and experts from 
government,  academia  and  industry  of  all  sizes  and  missions.  In  2020,  OSA  published  the  revised 
version of its Commercial Space System Security Guide. Therein, OSA discusses SC threats such as 
adversarial physical and espionage attacks, and states that “effective practices from other industrial 
sectors  –  augmented  by  measures  tailored  to  new  developments  and  specific  space  operations 
practices and needs – can form the basis for effective space sector supply chain cybersecurity” (OSA, 
2020, p. 24). Furthermore, OSA recommends that “critical parts and software should be sourced from 
these trusted vendors and checked for signs of counterfeiting or malicious content” (OSA, 2020, p. 
28). Finally, it strongly recommends a SC risk management programme 

“to ensure that each of their vendors handles hardware and software appropriately […] with 
an agreed-upon chain of custody [and] define approaches to ensure that vendors are trusted 
suppliers” (OSA, 2020, p. 28). 

Such a SC risk management should be endorsed on a NATO strategic level, as suggested throughout 
the following subsection. 

6.1.2  Increase NATO Strategic Level Engagement  

As  stated  by  Moon,  one  Ally’s  space  assets  being  attacked  will  impact  each  other’s  MS’s  security 
(Moon,  2017,  p.  8).  Hence,  the  strategic  coordination  of  space  asset  cybersecurity  is  vital  for  all 
NATO pillars of defence, whilst increased involvement of CSCRM should become a top priority for 
NATO’s strategic level executives. Eventually, this would allow for a whole-of-alliance approach to 
deter  space-based  threats  through  showcasing  the  importance  and  visibility  of  the  cyber  SASC 
(Yuval, 2019, p. 6). Following AJP-3.20, NATO commanders are required to  

“continuously monitor their areas of interest to anticipate potential crises and allow them to 
assist the strategic level in understanding [which] includes an analysis of cyberspace as part 
of the overall understanding of the operating environment [and] potential risks to friendly or 
neutral  usage  of  cyberspace  […]  against  NATO,  Member  States,  or  neutral  nations/entities 
(NSO, 2020, pp. 23-24). 

This  implies  the  creation  of  mission-specific  guidance,  agreements,  arrangements,  and  security 
considerations. Aligning, NIST emphasises on CSCRM as 

“a critical capability required for organizations to reduce the risk of business interruption if a 
cyber  incident  were  to  occur  [requiring]  close  integration  across  functional  and  business 
lines,  engage  executive  leadership  effectively  […]  foster  close  supplier  relationships,  and 
leverage industry standards throughout the supply chain lifecycle” (NIST, 2020, p. 5).  

To  integrate  the  strategic  level  more  effectively,  executive-level  SC  leadership  councils  should  be 
established  throughout  NATO  (NIST,  2020,  p.  5).  Education  on  cyber  SASC  risk  management 
should be introduced to NATO CCDCOE’s recurrent Executive Cyber Seminars. Widmann considers 
those seminars as the most appropriate level to discuss SC issues and cyber incidents, and consolidate 

54 

 
 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

strategic understanding of space asset cybersecurity and NATO’s critical dependence on it (Wells & 
Sielaff, 2020). The aim is to “provide the senior leadership with a baseline of information, so that if 
they  are  faced  with  a  cyber  issue  in  the  SASC,  they  would  have  the  information  that  they  need  to 
make  good  decisions”  (Widmann,  2020).  Furthermore,  as  stated  by  Unal,  the  annual  NATO 
Information Assurance Symposium (NIAS) could focus on space in the upcoming years. In doing so, 
NIAS could support the clarification on responsibilities and protection measures, and suggest higher-
grade  military  cyber  protection  as  well  as  security  specifications  for  critical  civilian  space 
applications used by the military (Unal, 2019, p. 16). Such executive-level gatherings will showcase 
commitment, formalize responsibilities and therefore effectively ensure CSCRM (NIST, 2020, pp. 8-
13). Concrete strategic decisions to timely increase resources, which might be decided upon during 
such seminars, include: 

-  The overall review and extension of space management within the NCIA, and SpSC’s role;  

-  Forming an organic SpSCE at each tactical-level HQ, being permanently staffed by at least 

one SME or liaison officer (Vasen, 2020, pp. 21-23);  

-  Establishing  a  Direct  Liaison  Authority  (DIRLAUTH)  between  the  operational  level  and 
national space capacity providers to reduce requesting times (Vasen, 2020, pp. 23-25); and 

-  Establishing  a  stand-alone  space  operations  AJP  to  properly  acknowledge  and  consider 

increasingly complex space capabilities. 

6.1.3  Spur Exchange of Academic Expertise 

NATO dependency on untrusted technology should be counteracted by strategic investment in space 
asset Research and Development (R&D) in collaboration with its MS, and hence the development of 
more viable alternatives (CSC, 2020, pp. 8-10). This might be done in collaboration with the existing 
NATO Science and Technology Organisation (STO) Information Systems Technology Panel (NATO 
STO, 2020). As stated by Silverstein, 

“NATO has a unique advantage as a collective organization to convene strategists from like-
minded but diverse military backgrounds […] a diverse cadre of experts would support the 
development of a comprehensive space strategy” (Silverstein, 2020, p. 7). 

Livingstone  suggests  inviting  outside  organisations  and  cybersecurity  experts  to  provide  expertise 
and differing perspectives on the topic and focus more on including cybersecurity into space asset’s 
designs. This might include for example to further spur cooperation between NATO and Europol, in 
particular  between  NCIA  and  the  European  Cybercrime  Centre  (EC3)  via  Europol’s  Platform  for 
Experts  (EPE).  EPE  is  a  “secure,  collaborative  web  platform  for  specialists  [which]  facilitates  the 
sharing  of:  best  practices;  documentation;  innovation;  knowledge;  non-personal  data  on  crime” 
(EUROPOL, 2020). Exchange and collaboration are enabled via virtual communities, sharing a wide 
range  of  expertise,  know-how,  and  information,  to  foster  an  environment  of  trust  and  online 
collaboration.  Thus,  “governments  should  not  compete  with  industry  but  instead  take  advantage  of 
the expertise in the industry and help to spur innovation going forward” (Bander et al., 2020). Hence, 
NATO will be allowed to encourage innovation and competition and drive excellence on the market, 
whilst  ensuring  that  the  appropriate  levels  of  security  are  met.  This  will  prevent  companies  from 
striving for private capital outside MS and may help to overcome industry competitors’ reluctance to 
share knowledge (GSA, 2019, p. 2). Also, common R&D will help to draft a common terminology 
within NATO and beyond, as technical cyber-speak should be adjusted and translated for the political 
space community (Waterman, 2019). 

55 

 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

NATO currently reviews the establishment of a NATO Space Technology Centre (Waterman, 2020, 
pp. 1-6). Such a centre would 

“bring  together  the  various  space-related  activities  of  the  NCIA,  from  SATCOM  and 
research to operational support […] summarized in a so-called “virtual hub” for space know-
how, projects and tools” (Kanig & Forkert, 2020, p. 1). 

This  is  important  for  the  needed  acceleration  of  NATO  space  awareness  and  the  fielding  of  new 
military capabilities, facing for example the rise of Artificial Intelligence79 (AI), further shifting the 
cyber landscape for space systems as space assets increasingly employ AI capabilities. Not only will 
NATO need to worry about cyber doctrine and how it interacts with space, but AI doctrine and how 
it  intersects  with  cyber  and  space.  Furthermore,  the  centre  should  be  led  by  or  involve  NCIA  in 
cooperation  with  other  COEs  like  CCDCOE,  to  “give  advice  on  relevant  cyberthreats  and 
vulnerabilities, such as those related to the integrity or security of supply chains” (Unal, 2019, p. 26). 
This  involves  research  and  recommendations  for  agreement  on  what  exactly  constitutes  space  as  a 
domain, what type of similarities and divergence space shares with cyber, and finally what kind of 
SC security approach should be modelled for NATO (Unal, 2019, p. 28). In that way, technological 
advancements  can  be  more  securely  incorporated  in  future  NATO  procurement  of  space  asset 
services (Zarkan, 2020).  

6.1.4  Conduct Mission-Specific Cyber SASC Risk Assessments  

NATO  needs  to  make  sure  to  know  the  procurement  and  SC  environment  around  each  specific 
mission,  sourcing  the  materials  and  services  to  the  level  of  integrity  required  (Livingstone,  2020). 
External  partners  should  be  analysed  based  on  an  exact  understanding  and  agreement  on  each 
mission’s  unique  risk  tolerance  and  critical  assets,  to  better  ensure  responsibilities  and  liabilities 
(Lister, 2020). Risk assessment policy recommendations between MS and NATO are highly needed 
“so  that  everybody  agrees  with  the  same  concept  of  diligence,  safety,  and  risk  management”  (Lee, 
2020). Silverstein points out that 

“without agreed-upon threat-assessment processes, allies may arrive at different conclusions 
about threats to space systems, based in part on their differing abilities to collect and analyse 
data.  This  directly  impacts  the  alliance’s  ability  to  come  to  a  consensus  decision” 
(Silverstein, 2020). 

NIST  encourages  the  move  “from  detective  to  preventive  capabilities  in  managing  third-party 
cybersecurity  risk”  (NIST,  2020,  p.  10)  through  establishing  a  proper  SC  cyber  risk  assessment 
framework.  Doing  so  would  ensure  cyber  SC  risk  accountability  across  the  organization  through 
manifesting policies, governance, procedures, tools and processes, as well as integrity, visibility and 
control  over  data  sent  to  and  received  by  any  supplier  (NIST,  2020,  pp.  9-13).  Furthermore,  risks 
assessments  are  essential  to  “identify  [,]  determine  [and]  estimate  the  likelihood  of  the  potential 
losses, [and] define the relative likelihood and consequence of various risks” (Pandey et al., 2020, p. 
16). A proper NATO SASC cyber risk assessment framework should therefore include: 

1.  Assessment of NATO-procured ICT components, such as hardware, software, and services:  

79 Artificial Intelligence: Defined as „the study of how to produce machines that have some of the qualities that the human 
mind has, such as the ability to understand language, recognize pictures, solve problems, and learn“ (Cambridge Dictionary, 
2020). 

56 

 
 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

Common risk assessment includes collaboratively and proactively using software to monitor SC 
interruptions, implement recall policies, or allocate resources early in the space asset development 
lifecycle  to  determine  SC  risks  and  their  feasibility  for  NATO.  Also,  this  includes  involving 
independent  cybersecurity  experts  for  up-to-date  analyses  on  procurement  samples;  considering 
“known vulnerabilities that could be exploited to carry out an attack or otherwise cause adverse 
events”  (CCSDS,  2019,  p.  12);  and  subsequently  scoring  potential  vulnerability  impacts  on 
NATO (NIST, 2020a, p. 13). Unal states that “any digital system that relies upon near real-time 
information  is  vulnerable  to  cyberattacks  […]  In  order  to  understand  the  value  of  each  space-
dependent capability, it is important to analyse the consequences of cyberattacks on each” (Unal, 
2019, p. 16). Bridging the gaps between the diverging areas of SC, cybersecurity and space assets 
present a “fascinating opportunity for different states to work together, because they are providing 
completely different perspectives, data and evidence and thus encourage out-of-the-box thinking 
when  anticipating  different  types  of  attacks”  (Lister,  2020b).  Additionally,  NCIA  could  further 
take  advantage  of  collaborative  open-source  tools  such  as  the  Malware  Information  Sharing 
Platform (MISP) to promote rapid “cooperation and information-sharing among allies [as being] 
one of the most effective defences in cyberspace” (Unal, 2019, p. 26). 

2.  Analysis of upstream suppliers, suppliers’ sources, and the larger SC ecosystem:  

It is key for NATO to identify and well manage critical space asset suppliers, which “if disrupted, 
would  create  a  negative  business  impact  on  the  organization”  (NIST,  2020b,  pp.  8-14).  This 
includes implementing preliminary review processes and rank suppliers based on their criticality 
to NATO, following a supplier criticality score prioritizing SC risks; and automate supplier risk 
monitoring and its mitigation. Firstly, mission-critical systems, assets, data, and processes need to 
be  identified  and  prioritized,  secondly,  those  suppliers  having  access  or  providing  infrastructure 
for  such  capacities.  Additionally,  supplier  practice  assessment  protocols  should  be  established, 
and  supplier  self-assessment  questionnaires  be  implemented  to  determine  whether  key,  agreed-
upon controls and requirements are being met and or improvements are required. Such steps will 
enable  NATO  to  “understand  how  NATO  can  partner  with  developers,  suppliers  and  vendors, 
maintain cybersecurity standards and ensure that validity, integrity and availability of the SASC 
are secured” (Lister, 2020).  

3.  Dedication  of  specified  NATO  personnel  to  effectively  assessing  and  communicating  supplier 

risks to NATO’s executive leadership:  

A  centralized  space  asset  SASC  cyber  risk  assessment  team  and  cross-functional  SC  Risk 
Councils should be established to proactively review and mitigate relevant risks (NIST, 2020, pp. 
5-8). These teams should be responsible for providing and enforcing oversight and guidance on 
SASC cyber risk assessments and requirements to business units, approving SC changes such as 
new  suppliers  or  contract  renewals,  and  providing  joint  post-incident  analysis  and  recurring 
seminars on the current SASC cyberthreat landscape. Thus, this team would serve as the central 
resource for SC threats (CSC, 2020, pp. 8-10). Such a new task force would significantly improve 
SASC  risk  information  sharing  and  appropriate  resource  funding  to  aggregate  all-source 
information  by  public  and  private  partners.  It  would  allow  to  rapidly  address  SC  incidents  and 
simplify  supplier  management  below  the  executive  leadership  level.  Finally,  it  would  set  an 
increased  focus  on  heightened  SCSRM  support  for  IT  service,  software,  and  hardware  SCs, 
pointing out particular vulnerabilities of each MS’s SC. 

57 

 
 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

6.1.5  Train Space Asset CSCRM throughout NATO Exercises  

NATO  should  include  space  asset  CSCRM  in  every  NATO  exercise,  to  support  NATO’s  forward-
leaning, collective defence approach (Vasen, 2020, pp. 21-23). Such a thorough joint training would 
enhance 

“allied  capacities  to  prevent,  defend  against,  and  recover  from  attacks  on  space 
infrastructure. In turn, these activities will demonstrate allied resolve to protect and leverage 
space systems in broader transatlantic security missions” (Silverstein, 2020, p. 9). 

Measures  should  include  “training  for  relevant  stakeholders’  organization-wide,  such  as  in  the 
departments  of  SC,  […]  legal,  as  well  as  key  suppliers”  (NIST,  2020a,  p.  16).  Lister  pledges  to 
include therefore relevant private sector suppliers and warns that  

“if  the  incident  response  to  a  cyber  SC  attack  is  not  rehearsed  by  members  of  the  space 
community  beforehand,  it  is  going  to  be  too  late  to  apply  lessons  learned  or  respond  most 
efficiently  and  effectively  when  facing  the  first  major  cyber  incident.  Also,  this  allows 
NATO  to  understand  all  of  the  stakeholders  of  such  an  incident  prior  to  responding  to  an 
incident,  which  can  help  save  valuable  response  time  during  an  actual  incident”  (Lister, 
2020b). 

Training  the  individual  end  user  of  space  assets  is  key,  as  a  lot  of  military  staff  are  frequently 
redeployed (Wells & Sielaff, 2020). Such training will help to identify responsible NATO functions, 
audit  suppliers  and  incorporate  feedback  and  thus  enhance  the  mutual  and  clear  understanding  of 
space assets’ potential contribution to operations, as required in AJP-3.2 (CISA, 2020, p. 1). 

Furthermore,  Heren  and  Caudill  advocate  for  engaging  white  hat  hackers 80  to  test  for  possible 
vulnerabilities  throughout  NATO  training  (Caudill,  2020).81 This  may  involve  issuing  rewards  for 
hackers  who  hack  a  satellite  and  disclose  their  method.  Some  other  training  steps  may  involve 
phishing  simulation  exercises,  mapping  upcoming  cyber  SC  threats  and  priorities,  or  tabletop 
exercises  to  determine  appropriate  stakeholders  and  their  responsibilities  throughout  incident 
response.  Subsequently,  training  and  test  reports  should  be  appropriately  shared  not  only  to  the 
military  and  intelligence  community,  but  as  well  the  commercial  sector  (Livingstone,  2020).  Such 
collaboration will help to “closely collaborate with […] key suppliers; include key suppliers in […] 
resilience and improvement activities [and] assess and monitor throughout the supplier relationship 
[and] plan for the full lifecycle” (NIST, 2020b, p. 6).  

6.2  Regulation  

The  significant  need  for  security  regulations  on  all  space  asset  segments  is  aggravated  by  severe 
difficulties  in  resolving  vulnerabilities  once  on-orbit  assets  are  in  space.  Highest-level  advocacy 
within NATO is needed to reach similar sophistication of written guidance for space as it exists for 

80  White  hat  hackers:  also  known  as  ethical  hackers;  “employees  or  contractors  working  for  companies  as  security 
specialists that attempt to find security holes via hacking” (Norton, 2020). 
81 This  might  be  done  in  form  of  penetration  tests,  thus  “to  find,  exploit  and  thus  determine  the  risk  of  architecture 
vulnerabilities” (Privasec, 2019) or a Red Team assessment, being more targeted “to test the organisation’s detection and 
response capabilities” (Privasec, 2019). 

58 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

Air,  Land,  Sea  and  Cyber  (Vasen,  2020,  pp.  22-23).  Hence,  NATO  should  adopt  a  comprehensive 
regulatory  and  standardization  framework  for  its  SASC  suppliers.  This  should  include  mandatory 
reports of all space asset cyber breaches, and guidance on prioritization and determination of critical 
components  and  responsibilities  (Akoto,  2020,  p.  7).  Aim  should  be  to  substitute  the  principle  of 
Security by Obscurity by a principle of Security by Design and Default both for technology and SCs, 
turning  NATO  into  a  cybersecurity-aware,  constantly  learning  organization,  analysing  but  not 
punishing incidences and celebrating good and best practices. 

6.2.1  Streamline Data Standardization and Classification Levels  

NATO  MS  should  discuss  “how  national  capabilities  can  work  together  with  others,  how  they  can 
provide national ISR for the common good and share that information with other MS” (Hill, 2020). 
Silverstein states that 

“many NATO members are undeniably proficient in space technology and can contribute to 
sharing  agreements  [on]  unique  data  and  capabilities,  and  also  build  beneficial  redundant 
layers within the NATO space ecosystem. These redundancies help bridge the gap between 
growing  military  reliance  on  satellites  and  the  inherent  fragility  of  space  objects” 
(Silverstein, 2020, p. 7). 

Wells points to standardized encryption of all data throughout the NATO SASC having to become 
obligatory, as “one has always to operate under the assumption that somebody tapped in” (Wells & 
Sielaff, 2020). However, as suggested by Falco (2020), not all systems and organizations may be able 
to  afford  the  processing  around  this,  especially  when  considering  legacy  systems.  Thus,  it  is 
important  to  consider  the  prioritization  of  risk  mitigation  techniques,  encryption  being  included. 
Furthermore,  Vasen  suggests  introducing  formatting  standardization  throughout  NATO’s  cyber 
SASC,  such  as  through  following  specific  frequencies  for  SATCOM  or  software,  or  streamlining 
data formatting such as for timing. This will simplify the integration of given data within NATO’s 
processing systems. Such formatting standardization should be continuously undertaken by each MS 
before forwarding data to NATO, to decomplicate its later use. 

Additionally, classification levels for key members in the commercial sector should be streamlined, 
to  reduce  “barriers  to  sharing  space  systems  and  data”  (Silverstein,  2020,  p.  5).  Therefore,  NATO 
should invest in unified secure platforms for exchanging information with suppliers, allowing them to 
involve  the  military  end-user  in  the  development  and  production  supply  chain  to  give  immediate 
feedback.  As  an  example,  the  US  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (ODNI)  currently 
aims  to  declassify  information  such  as  through  one-time  read-ins  for  permitted  SC  members, 
influencing  supplier  conduct  through  contractual  security  requirements.  Such  streamlining  may 
resolve military stove-pipe thinking through allowing for 

“agile  acquisition  processes  capable  of  absorbing  innovative  capabilities,  commercial  and 
military [,] more flexible, agile and resilient […] acquisition processes and faster command 
and control constructs to maintain the advantage in any conflict” (US Space Force & US Air 
Force, 2020, p. 8). 

Finally, as stated by Yingst, streamlined “vetting of staff to avoid insider threats is critical to provide 
security and trust, whether it’s the service provider or those who are providing assets, hardware or 
software  to  the  space  infrastructure  or  the  operators  of  the  space  infrastructure”  (Yingst,  2020). 
Sielaff  states  that  employees  need  to  undergo  stricter  clearances  and  have  a  good  operational

understanding  of  interacting  with  commercial  representatives  and  users.  Thus,  CCSDS  suggests 
developing an enterprise security plan, which is an 

“assurance that any shared resources (e.g., organizational processes, networks, and physical 
facilities)  are  adequate  for  the  highest  criticality  and  sensitivity  handled  […  which]  should 
take into account regulatory authority, trust relationships, supply chain, and line management 
authority” (CCSDS, 2019, p. 16). 

6.2.2  Enhance Procurement Contract Requirements 

A standardized security framework for SASC cybersecurity should be created for NATO procurement 
processes  to  enhance  contract  requirements.  As  stated  by  Falco,  “we  need  to  move  forward  and 
increase accountability of manufacturers and space asset component developers for software and any 
other  part  of  the  SC”  (Falco,  2020).  This  includes  streamlining  working  terminology,  external  and 
internal assessments, incident reporting and communications across all partners and entities, as “there 
seems to be a lack of organised structure as far as regulation within the community” (Lister, 2020). 
Thereby, Timm states that “when you look at the actual SC cybersecurity itself, everything comes to 
play  through  a  contract.  You  have  to  install  controls  in  the  contracts  down  the  SC,  to  increase 
responsibility and knowledge about adverse effects” (Bander et al., 2020).  

Hence, NATO should, at a strategic level, further focus on enhancing its supplier contracts to allow 
for  more  security,  integrity,  and  quality  of  data  delivered  (CISA,  2020,  p.  1).  This  should  be  done 
through  integrating  or  partially  adopting  industry  standards  and  procedures,  to  provide  for  an 
understandable and manageable structure of the SASC. Within NATO, Standardization Agreements 
(STANAG)  or  NATO  Standardization  Recommendations  (STANREC)  might  be  used  as  cover 
agreements.  This  would  reduce  disaggregated,  smaller  space  asset  contract  series  to  a  centralized 
industry  procurement  framework  (Waterman,  2020,  pp.  1-6).  Thereby,  as  suggested  by  US  Space 
Force  and  US  Air  Force,  through  creating  “a  single-entry  point  for  all  SATCOM  requirements, 
enterprise  SATCOM  needs  can  be  acquired  in  a  deliberate  and  efficient  manner,  avoiding  the 
stovepipes  of  the  past  […]  using  multi-year,  pooled-resource  contracts  when  possible”  (US  Space 
Force  &  US  Air  Force,  2020,  p.  8).  Finally,  such  an  approach  will  simplify  senior  leadership’s 
oversight  through  a  common  playbook,  single  incident-handling  processes,  and  will  prevent 
duplications to the greatest possible extent. Appropriate regulation enhancement measures include: 

1.  Adopting  a  standards-oriented,  streamlined  supplier  risk  approach  to  SASC  cyber  risk 

assessment processes; 

2.  Incorporating  strengthened  insurances,  such  as  for  data  confidentiality,  into  negotiations 

with suppliers;  

3.  Better monitoring progress, incidents and operations via customer and supplier assessments 

to determine SASC cyber risk assessment maturity.  

However,  NATO  should  as  well  ensure  “that  commercial  contracts  meet  military  protection 
standards, in order to mitigate the risk posed by the military’s use of commercial space assets” (Unal, 
2019,  p.  26).  Commercial  standards  complying  to  those  requirements,  which  could  be  partially  or 
completely  adopted  by  NATO,  exist  and  are  well-trusted  (Wells  &  Sielaff,  2020).  Such  standards 
include:

Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

DOD CYBERSECURITY MATURITY MODEL CERTIFICATION  

Across the board of interviewees, the US DOD Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 
is seen as currently the closest regulation to secure NATO mission-critical data retrieved from space 
assets (Caudill, 2020; Widmann, 2020). CMMC was released in February 2020 and aims to prevent 
foreign  information  theft  and  hacking  throughout  contractor  SCs.  It  is  the  US  government’s  most 
ambitious effort so far to shore up cyber vulnerabilities (Tritten, 2020, pp. 1-5). CMMC is imposed 
as an universal auditing measure, threshold condition for governmental bidding contracts as well as a 
strict standard on COTS security. Miller states that the CMMC makes 

“the  transition  to  a  model  in  which  every  company  that  does  business  with  the  federal 
government is being held accountable to implementing security. This securing of the entire 
defence SC is an enormous undertaking and will be a multi-decade effort” (Miller, 2020). 

Based partly on AIA National Aerospace Standard NAS9933, CMMC is a sophisticated model with 
different  requirement  and  classification  levels:  it  proposes  five  different  levels  of  cybersecurity 
controls, structures and methodologies (Bander et al., 2020).  Whilst Level 1 imposes the lowest level 
of  cybersecurity  requirements  on  a  contractor,  Level  5  requires  the  most  stringent  controls  for  the 
most  sensitive  operations.  CMMC  Levels  4  and  5  relate  directly  to  NIST  800-172  (see  below). 
Thereby, Timm states that 

“every  company  in  the  SC  of  a  prime,  who  will  ultimately  have  CMMC  on  their  contract, 
will be certified at least at CMMC Level 1. This basically includes 15 controls directly taken 
from  the  US  Federal  Acquisition  Regulation  (FAR),  called  the  cybersecurity  framework. 
Additionally,  those  15  controls  relate  to  17  out  of  the  110  controls  in  NIST  171,  being 
compliant to very basic cyber hygiene” (Bander et al., 2020). 

The CMMC is expected to be specifically important for NATO due to the high number of US-NATO 
common weapons systems and components, and therefore intermingled military procurement and SC 
issues (Lee, 2020). The same is true for the use of commercial software running on NATO systems 
such  as  basic  Microsoft  Office365  software.  Thus,  for  space  asset-retrieved  data,  Lee  and  Timm 
suggest  requiring  a  minimum  of  CMMC  Level  3  of  suppliers,  managed  processes,  and  good  cyber 
hygiene, which would allow “some level of assurance and create trust that suppliers actually supply a 
product  which  does  what  it  is  supposed  to  do  and  does  not  have  any  malware  implemented”  (Lee, 
2020). Additionally, Lee suggests imposing even a higher CMMC level for contractors producing GS 
components (Lee, 2020, see 4.2.1). Widmann warns that it will be easier for the US to install such a 
stringent regulation as it is a single federal government, however in case of NATO, the high number 
of different MS will significantly prolong the process.  

ISO 27001 

Interviewees  across  the  board  cited  the  ISO  27001  Standard  as  being  one  the  most  important  and 
basic  standard  to  regulate  the  nexus  between  space,  cyber  and  SC.  ISO  27001  was  developed  in 
collaboration  with  the  International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (IEC)  in  2008,  and  continuously 
updated  until  2016.  It  bases  on  the  unification  of  British  and  German  IT  security  standards,  and 
therefore  draws  on  expertise  of  many  different  industries  and  application  domains  from  different 
cultural backgrounds. The standard aims to 

“keep  information  assets  secure  [through]  a  framework  for  policies  and  procedures  that 
include all legal, physical, and technical controls involved in an organization’s information 

61 

 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

risk  management  processes  [and]  define  how  to  implement,  monitor,  maintain,  and 
continually  improve  […]  divisions  of  responsibility,  availability,  access  control,  security, 
auditing, and corrective and preventive measures” (Microsoft, 2020). 

CCSDS  states  that  these  controls  “should  be  satisfied  for  space  systems  where  third-party  services 
are used” (CCSDS, 2019, p. 16). ISO 27001 addresses “information security in supplier relationships 
to ensure protection of the organization’s assets that is accessible by suppliers” (CCSDS, 2019, p. 16) 
through 

– A.15.1.1 Information security policy for supplier relationships; 
– A.15.1.2 Addressing security within supplier agreements; and 
– A.15.1.3 the IT SC which “should be satisfied for all facilities and systems affiliated with a 
mission” (CCSDS, 2019, p. 16). 

Furthermore, ISO 27001 suggests “supplier service delivery management to maintain an agreed level 
of information security and service delivery in line with supplier agreements” (CCSDS, 2019, p. 16) 
through 

– A.15.2.1 Monitoring and review of supplier services; and 
– A.15.2.2 Managing changes to supplier services [which] should be satisfied for all systems 
(CCSDS, 2019, p. 16). 

NATIONAL AEROSPACE STANDARD NAS9933  

The  AIA  National  Aerospace  Standard  NAS9933  on  Critical  Security  Controls  for  Effective 
Capability  in  Cyber  Defense  consists  of  20  control  families  published  by  the  Centre  for  Internet 
Security (CIS) and two additional families. Each family consists of Critical Security Controls (CSC) 
“to  provide  companies  with  a  methodology  to  evaluate  their  systems  and  processes”  (AIA,  2018). 
This includes several sub-controls, being categorized into five levels of capability “instead of a one-
size-fits  all  checklist  for  compliance”  (AIA,  2018).  This  standard  aims  at  fulfilling  two  primary 
goals: 

“[1] To provide industry partners an indication of a company’s cybersecurity profile (beyond 
compliance-based controls), as a way to measure a company’s cybersecurity risk [and 2] To 
align  the  fragmented  and  conflicting  requirements  […]  contracting  process  imposes  on 
industry.  Rather  than  different  DOD  organizations  using  different  tools  to  assess  a 
company’s security across different contracts, this standard is designed to apply common and 
universal elements of cybersecurity across each enterprise” (AIA, 2018). 

AIA states that it aims at  

“true risk- and threat-based cybersecurity [to] enable reciprocity, so that a company’s level of 
security is accepted by all prime contractors, systems integrators, and DOD […] to establish 
the cybersecurity baseline in the aerospace and defence industry” (AIA, 2018). 

NIST SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS 800-37 AND 800-53  

The  most  straightforward  set  of  standards  to  introduce  across  NATO  MS  are  NIST  standards,  as 
these  are  already  widely  adopted  and  trusted  (Yingst,  2020).  NIST  standards  recommend  a  risk 
management approach, lining out what can be done to prevent acquisition of compromised software 
and  hardware  (Lister,  2020).  As  stated  by  NIST,  organizations  should  be  aware  “of  the  expanded 
attack surface that results from an interconnected and globally complex SC […] progress remains to 

62 

 
 
 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

be  made  on  proactive  incident  detection,  response,  and  recovery”  (NIST,  2020a,  p.  18).  NIST 
recommends that  

“Contractual  terms  and  conditions  include  insurance,  access  requirements,  and  background 
checks; Suppliers are contractually obligated to disclose component vulnerabilities, data loss, 
and  security  incidents;  […]  Contractual  terms  and  conditions  include  a  specific  section  on 
information security requirements as well as consequences if there is a failure to comply with 
the requirements for security, quality, and integrity” (NIST, 2020a, p. 12). 

With  regards  to  supplier  management,  and  in  alignment  with  6.1.3,  NIST  recommends  three  key 
focuses (NIST, 2020a, pp. 11-12): 

1.  Determining  criticality  of  suppliers  through  business  impact  if  the  supplier  fails  or  is 
compromised,  the  supplier’s  operational  stability,  and  classification  level  of  data  needed. 
Each supplier should be subsequently score-graded: if suppliers require logical and physical 
access  to  the  agency’s  network,  or  products  contribute  to  long-term  strategic  aims,  they 
elevate in criticality and thus should become subject to ongoing security monitoring.  

2.  Establishing  cybersecurity  requirements  within  contracts,  including  a  standardized  set  of 
cybersecurity  conditions  and  requirements  in  contract  negotiations  to  ensure  a  minimum 
security  level,  incorporated  security  considerations,  and  aligned  relationship  expectations 
early in the process of acquisition.  

3.  Conducting  annual  organizational  surveys  of  critical  suppliers,  to  ensure  data,  people, 
policies,  and  cybersecurity  practices  are  up  to  date  to  support  and  ensure  contracts.  This 
includes surveying the conduct of supplier cybersecurity training and physical, network and 
IT  security  measures,  and  security  assessment  of  organizational  data  exposed  to  external 
networks.  

NIST  Special  Publication  (SP)  800-37  updates  the  NIST  “Risk  Management  Framework  for 
Information  Systems  and  Organizations:  A  System  Life  Cycle  Approach  for  Security  and  Privacy” 
(NIST, 2018). NIST SP 800-37 describes in further detail vulnerabilities within an organization’s SC 
(NIST, 2018, p. 42). It incorporates SC risk management processes, hence security and privacy risks, 
and  acknowledges  that  “adversaries  are  using  the  supply  chain  as  an  attack  vector  and  effective 
means of penetrating our systems, compromising the integrity of system elements, and gaining access 
to critical assets” (NIST, 2018, p. v). Hence, NIST SP 800-37 suggests to specifically introduce SC 
risk  assessment  concepts  “to  address  untrustworthy  suppliers,  insertion  of  counterfeits,  tampering, 
unauthorized production, theft, insertion of malicious code, and poor manufacturing and development 
practices” (NIST, 2018, p. vi), further referring to ISO. It encourages to build up trust relationships 
and good communicating with both external and internal stakeholders, determining appropriate risk 
mitigating and management plans, document mitigating actions, and monitor the performance of such 
plans (NIST, 2018, p. 21). Thereby, it suggests that monitoring should include “regularly reviewing 
supplier foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI), monitoring inventory forecasts, or requiring 
on-going audits of suppliers” (NIST, 2018, p. 35). 

NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 on Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information 
Systems and Organizations aims to “reduce the extent of malicious code propagation […] including 
those failures induced by SC attacks […] employing different information technologies [and] using 

63 

 
Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

different  suppliers”  (NIST,  2013,  p.  362).  Additionally,  it  promotes  cyber  resiliency82 measures  to 
shorten and prevent SC attacks and reduce the level of adversarial impact.  

NIST SP 800-171  

In 2018, NIST SP 800-171 on Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems 
was issued, directing DOD prime and sub-contractors to comply with 110 new security requirements. 
Thereby, NIST states that  

“defence contractors must implement the recommended requirements contained in NIST SP 
800-171  to  demonstrate  their  provision  of  adequate  security  to  protect  the  covered  defence 
information  included  in  their  defence  contracts  […]  if  a  manufacturer  is  part  of  a  DOD, 
General  Services  Administration  (GSA),  NASA  or  other  federal  or  state  agencies’  supply 
chain” (NIST, 2019). 

Whilst  many  large  contractors  in  the  defence  are  already  maintaining  a  sufficiently  high  level  of 
cybersecurity  against  most  foreign  sabotage  or  intellectual  espionage  attacks,  many  smaller-  and 
medium-size  companies  are  still  alarmingly  unprepared.  Such  subcontractor  companies  typically 
handle so-called controlled unclassified information83 (CUI) throughout manufacturing and systems, 
thus  being  foreign  hacking  prime  targets.  NIST  requirements  include,  beneath  others,  “training 
necessary  for  […]  SC  security  within  the  context  of  organizational  information  security  programs” 
(Ross, Dempsey, et al., 2020, p. 94), reporting SC events, and cyber incident response actions. This 
involves “notifying relevant external organizations, for example, external mission/business partners, 
Supply  Chain  partners,  external  service  providers,  and  peer  or  supporting  organizations”  (Ross, 
Dempsey, et al., 2020, p. 125). 

NIST 800-172 (DRAFT) 

At the time of this thesis, NIST SP 800-171 is being reviewed and NIST SP 800-172 on Enhanced 
Security  Requirements  for  Protecting  Controlled  Unclassified  Information:  A  Supplement  to  NIST 
Special  Publication  800-171  being  created.  Thereby,  industrial  sector  companies  were  invited  to 
provide  online  comments  to  the  draft  (NIST,  2020).  NIST  800-172  points  especially  to  “the 
protection of Controlled Unclassified Information […] to successfully conduct its essential missions 
and  functions”  (NIST,  2020).  It  underlines  that  “many  federal  contractors,  for  example,  routinely 
process,  store,  and  transmit  sensitive  federal  information  in  […]  communications,  satellite,  and 
weapons  systems”  (NIST,  2020,  p.  13).  Furthermore,  NIST  promotes  the  development  of  a  CUI 
Registry, promoting that such a registry  

“identifies  approved  CUI  categories,  provides  general  descriptions  for  each,  identifies  the 
basis  for  controls,  and  sets  out  procedures  for  the  use  of  CUI,  including  but  not  limited  to 

82 Cyber resiliency: the ability to “anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or 
compromises  on  systems  that  use  or  are  enabled  by  cyber  resources  [to]  can  continue  to  operate  even  in  a  degraded  or 
debilitated state, carrying out mission-essential functions” (NIST, 2019, p. 16). 
83 Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): a category “of unclassified information within the US Federal government 
that  requires  safeguarding  or  dissemination  controls  pursuant  to  and  consistent  with  applicable  law,  regulations,  and 
government-wide policies but is not classified under Executive Order 13526” (US National Archives, 2016)

This  concerns  “acquisition  or  procurement  responsibilities  (e.g.,  contracting  officers)  […]  as  the 
entity  responding  to  and  complying  with  the  security  requirements  set  forth  in  contracts  or 
agreements” (NIST, 2020, p. 15). Regarding the SC, it suggests to 

“employ  automated  discovery  and  management  tools  to  maintain  an  up-to-date,  complete, 
accurate,  and  readily  available  inventory  of  system  components  [including]  manufacturer, 
supplier  information,  component  type,  date  of  receipt,  cost,  model,  serial  number,  and 
physical location” (NIST, 2020, p. 27). 

NIST requests to “assess, respond to, and monitor SC risks associated with organizational systems 
and system components” (NIST, 2020, p. 34), stating that  

“managing SC risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort 
across  an  organization  to  build  trust  relationships  and  communicate  with  both  internal  and 
external  stakeholders.  SC  risk  management  (SCRM)  activities  involve  identifying  and 
assessing  risks,  determining  appropriate  mitigating  actions,  developing  SCRM  plans  to 
document  selected  mitigating  actions,  and  monitoring  performance  against  plans”  (NIST, 
2020, p. 34). 

NIST 800-172 is a “very practical, collaborative effort [however] you need to make sure that what is 
going  on  in  the  US  is  also  being  looked  at  globally,  ensuring  that  there  is  collaboration  across 
borders” (Bander et al., 2020).  

US SPD-5 

The recently released US Memorandum  on  Space  Policy  Directive-5—Cybersecurity  Principles  for 
Space Systems (SPD5), issued on 4 September 2020, is 

“billed  as  the  first  comprehensive  government  policy  related  to  cybersecurity  for  satellites 
and  related  systems,  and  outlines  a  set  of  best  practices,  but  not  firm  requirements,  that 
agencies  and  companies  should  follow  to  protect  space  systems  from  hacking  and  other 
cyberthreats” (Foust, 2020). 

This includes principles and best practices regarding authentication, encryption of C2 links from and 
to  satellites,  jamming  or  spoofing  of  communications,  protection  of  GS,  and  “intrusion  detection 
systems  for  all  aspects  of  space  system  architectures“  (Foust,  2020).  Furthermore,  SPD5  points 
towards  the  Space  ISAC  for  collaboration.  It  particularly  considers  SC  issues,  stating  that  it  „is 
necessary  for  developers,  manufacturers,  owners,  and  operators  of  space  systems  to  design,  build, 
operate, and manage them so that they are resilient to cyber incidents” (White House, 2020). Also, 
SPD5  stresses  that  “most  space  vehicles  in  orbit  cannot  currently  be  physically  accessed.  For  this 
reason,  integrating  cybersecurity  into  all  phases  of  development  and  ensuring  full  life-cycle 
cybersecurity  are  critical  for  space  systems”  (White  House,  2020).  Finally,  SPD5  suggests  that 
“space system owners and operators should collaborate to promote the development of best practices 
[and]  share  threat,  warning,  and  incident  information  within  the  space  industry“  (White  House, 
2020), and emphasises on the need for cybersecurity plans which 

“ensure the ability to verify the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of critical functions 
and the missions, services, and data they enable and provide [including] Management of SC 
risks  that  affect  cybersecurity  of  space  systems  through  tracking  manufactured  products;

Chapter 6: Policy Recommendations 

requiring  sourcing  from  trusted  suppliers;  identifying  counterfeit,  fraudulent,  and  malicious 
equipment; and assessing other available risk mitigation measures” (White House, 2020). 

Miller points to SPD5 as being instrumental to “collaborate with international partners and raise the 
security posture for the entire space sector, to be able to understand what the best regulations are that 
need to be put in place” (Miller, 2020). 

6.3  Summary 

Two  major  collaboration  initiatives  should  be  followed  to  allow  NATO  to  timely  recognise 
cyberthreats to mission-critical data early on along the SASC: a) raising awareness and b) pushing 
forward the creation of an adaptive framework of regulation. In doing so, NATO would be able to 
fully leverage the potentials of its new Space Policy and its Declaration of Space as an Operational 
Domain. Thus, it would function as a formal and informal MS consultation and conversation forum, 
making full use of its broad collective MS portfolio, as suggested by NATO SG Stoltenberg. Hence, 
hypothesis  two  (H2)  is  confirmed.  However,  it  has  become  apparent  that  a  safer  supply  of  NATO 
mission-critical data depends on more factors than only on the establishment of a strict international 
legal and operational framework, or transparent development, design, management, and ownership of 
space assets. In conclusion of this study, the following, final chapter will summarize those findings.

Chapter 7: Conclusion 

7  CONCLUSION  

With the launch of the first artificial satellite in 1957, space became vital for enabling national and 
international  security.  However,  it  was  only  in  2019  that  NATO  issued  its  first  Space  Policy  and 
recognized  space  as  an  operational  domain.  As  NATO  does  not  possess  its  own  on-orbit  space 
segments, this was followed in 2020 by a MOU between NATO, France, Italy, the UK, and the US, 
being those NATO MS with the strongest knowledge of space and cyber. The MOU ensures fifteen 
more years of critical MS space capacity to the Alliance, and may well counteract the lack of security 
by  design  throughout  commercial  space  assets  included  in  NATO’s  SASC.  Numerous  cyber 
vulnerabilities  may  impact  control  over  such  space  assets  and  thus  reliability  on  mission-critical 
information.  Consequences  would  be  dire  and  could  include  widespread  disruptions  or  permanent 
shut-down  of  space  assets,  DoS,  or  attacks  on  national  CI.  This  threat  is  aggravated  by  NATO’s 
mostly  unregulated  cyber  SASC,  recent  national  trends  to  launch  COTS  space  technology,  and 
therefore  augmented  complexity  of  space  asset  ownership  and  liability.  Hence,  this  thesis  aimed  at 
identifying such cybersecurity gaps along NATO’s SASC in order to help readers understand if and 
how  such  gaps  threaten  the  integrity  and  security  of  NATO’s  missions  and  hence  support 
organizational resilience against cyberattacks, so that NATO may better assure its missions against 
adversaries  in  cyberspace.  By  conducting  qualitative,  empirical  research,  and  following  a  thorough 
academic literature research in Chapter 2, this thesis was guided by a twofold research question: 

a) What are current cybersecurity gaps along NATO’s global SASC; and  

b) How can NATO and its allied MS gain greater control over such gaps to safeguard the 

supply of NATO mission-critical information? 

To answer these questions, Chapter 3 identified prominent use cases of space assets for NATO, as 
well as relevant NATO-internal contracts, division of responsibilities and according mechanisms. It 
became clear that space assets are key enablers for NATO’s most advanced technological systems, 
missions,  and  operations.  Key  services  are  SATCOM,  providing  crucial  telecommunications  and 
capacities such as broadband internet, mobile services; ISR, allowing to provide joint force planners 
with  multi-spectral  information  on  subsurface,  surface,  and  air  conditions;  PNT,  enabling  precise 
navigation  and  timing;  and  deterrence,  facing  a  rapid  arms  race  in  and  through  space.  As  stated 
above,  NATO  does  not  own  on-orbit  space  segments,  yet  currently  operates  twenty  GS  and  uses 
national  MILSATCOM  services.  SATCOM  remains  under  responsibility  of  NCIA,  whilst  ISR  is 
mostly handled by JISR. Additionally, JAPCC, CCDCOE as well as the soon to be established Space 
COE  provide  awareness  and  counselling.  SpSC  coordinates  operational  space  functions.  However, 
this wide spread of responsibilities over NATO’s internal and external system  obscures liability in 
case of an attack.  

Chapter  4  investigated  crucial  space  asset  cybersecurity  gaps.  By  taking  out  a  single  space  asset 
segment, thus either GS, space segment or data link, the whole space asset system is likely to become 
inoperable. Actors behind attacks are classified in either nation-state actors, professional or amateur 
hackers,  organised  criminals,  or  insiders.  Their  attribution  and  localization  become  extremely 
difficult  due  to  both  cyberspace’s  and  outer  space’s  ambiguous  and  completely  borderless  nature. 
Nonetheless,  attribution  remains  an  important  piece  of  deterrence  to  ensure  that  adversaries  realize 

67 

 
 
 
 
 
Chapter 7: Conclusion 

that  there  will  be  consequences  for  actions  taken  in  the  cyber  domain,  hence  adding  to  NATO’s 
resilience  posture.  As  further  concluded  in  this  chapter,  main  cyber-related  risks  in  space  asset 
segments include:  

1.  Legacy and/or unsegmented soft- and hardware being installed in GS and space segment’s 

systems, allowing for eased interception of data;  

2.  The  increased  use  of  COTS  technology  for  SmallSats  and  insecure  management  of 

encryption, easing tampering of data during its transfer;  

3.  A  lack  of  expertise  on  the  nexus  between  space  and  cybersecurity  and  governmental 

reluctance to report cyber incidents, hence hindering awareness; and  

4.  The  absence  of  international  instruments  to  regulate  conduct  in  space,  adding  to 
geographical  limits  of  NATO  Treaty Article  6  preventing  the  triggering  of  the  Principle  of 
Individual or Collective Defence, and diminishing NATO’s capacity to deter.  

Chapter  5  applied  and  expanded  these  findings  to  NATO’s  space  asset  cybersecurity.  The  rapidly 
increasing number of globally widespread suppliers involved in proliferating the various components 
of  space  assets  multiplies  to  an  uncontrollable  number  of  possible  cyberthreats  and  vulnerabilities. 
This might crucially impact NATO as well as its staff on the ground, including possible casualties. 
Whilst outsourcing to external public and private companies is needed to stay competitive and up to 
date  with  innovative  technology  to  execute  NATO’s  operations  to  the  best  possible  extent,  this 
increased  obscurity  of  SCs  eases  the  implementation  of  third-party  vulnerabilities  in  space  assets’ 
soft- and hardware. This is aggravated by  

1.  NATO’s  dependency  on  dual-use  space  assets,  leaving  open  responsibility  in  case  of  a  SC 

cyberattack;  

2.  Market  pressure  increasing  NATO’s  need  to  stay  competitive,  trading  off  cybersecurity 

concerns through public and private SC partners;  

3.  Classification  restrictions  and  formatting  misalignment  between  NATO,  MS,  and  private 
companies, limiting the sharing of essential threat intelligence and intrusion prevention;  

4.  Lacking  SASC  risk  management  training  and  awareness,  diminishing  performance  during 

crises such as the ongoing COVID pandemic; and  

5.  Significant  understaffing  and  lack  of  clarity  in  coordinating  space-related  tasks  between 
NATO  entities,  aggravated  by  a  lack  of  resources  and/or  willingness  to  focus  on 
cybersecurity enhancement.  

Therefore,  this  thesis  has  shown  that  NATO  missions  and  operations  are  indeed  threatened  by  the 
integrity of mission-critical data being relatively easy to compromise. Any sophisticated, SC-enabled 
cyberattack  on  NATO-utilized  SATCOM,  ISR,  or  PNT  space  assets  and  services  may  jeopardize 
NATO’s missions, undermine its capability to deter, and cause severe consequences for MS national 
security. These findings confirm hypothesis one stating that  

(H1)  Cybersecurity  gaps  along  NATO’s  SASC  are  likely  to  originate  from  a)  outsourcing  of  space 
capabilities to private companies, b) the use of outdated software and c) an almost complete 
lack of international laws and regulations. 

However, following preceding findings, H1 needs to be extended as follows: 

68 

 
 
 
 
Chapter 7: Conclusion 

1 

 Current cybersecurity gaps along NATO’s cyber SASC are caused by  

a)  Cyber  vulnerabilities,  including  legacy  and  unsegmented  space  asset  systems,  use  of  COTS 
technology, and lacking expertise and SASC regulation; and 

b) Inadequate handling of NATO’s cyber SASC, such as misaligned classification and formatting, 
lacking risk management training, or significant operational, space-related understaffing. 

The same is true for hypothesis two, stating that  

(H2)  A  safer  supply  of  NATO  mission-critical  information  is  likely  to  be  ensured  through  the 
establishment  of  a  strict  international  legal  and  operational  framework,  establishing 
transparent development, design, management, and ownership of space assets.  

As  shown  throughout  the  preceding  chapter,  additional  measures  are  needed  to  timely  recognise 
SASC cyberthreats to mission-critical data. Thus, H2 is extended as follows: 

2  

NATO and its allied MS can gain greater control over such cyber SASC gaps by  

a) Rising awareness through increased intersectoral collaboration and strategic level engagement, 
mission-specific risk assessments and training, and spurring R&D; and  

b)  Providing  a  platform  for  regulation  making, whilst centralizing responsibilities, streamlining 
security, classification, and formatting, and creating a standardized contract security framework. 

Concluded,  required  policy  changes  and  specific  recommendations  as  highlighted  throughout

Chapter 7: Conclusion 

By  completely  or  partly  adopting  these  policy  recommendations,  NATO  would  strive  to  fully 
leverage  the  potential  of  its  2019  Space  Policy  and  its  Declaration  of  Space  as  an  Operational 
Domain. Additionally, this would allow NATO to function as a formal and informal MS consultation 
forum on SASC cybersecurity. This way, it would make full use of its broad collective MS portfolio, 
best practices and lessons learned, as suggested by NATO SG Stoltenberg.  

These  findings  are  in  line  with  the  assumptions  of  neoliberal  institutionalist  theory.  As  has  been 
shown, NATO and national actors seek to maximize their gain from space assets to maintain relative 
power and the ability to deter. This behaviour is enforced by commercial competition and innovation. 
Throughout  this  thesis,  this  was  proven  by  findings  which  align  with  neoliberal  institutionalist 
theory, thus highlighting that  

a)  Lacking cooperation between NATO as an international organization and its MS, as well as 
commercial  SC  partners,  hinders  to  find  problem  solutions  and  create  internationally 
binding regulations;  

b)  Commercial  competitiveness  spurred  by  the  search  for  economic  efficiency,  competitive 

advantage, and cheaper labour trades off security concerns.  

Following  neoliberal  institutionalism,  and  aligned  with  above  presented  policy  recommendations, 
NATO’s role should be to guide and advise MS in resolving global political and economic issues, to 
reduce  individual  cost  and  uncertainty.  Therefore,  NATO  should  consider  a  shift  from  regarding 
cyber  SASC  risk  management  from  being  ‘nice-to-have’  to  being  mandated  and  critical.  Doing  so 
will  ease  safeguarding  of  delivery  and  integrity  of  NATO  mission-critical  data,  better  integrate 
suppliers  and  manufacturers  along  the  cyber  SASC,  and  increase  transparency,  responsibility,  and 
liability.  Furthermore,  this  will  ease  NATO  to  stay  competitive,  deterring  and  up  to  date  with 
innovative  technology,  enhancing  outcomes  of  NATO  missions  and  operations  to  the  best  possible 
extent.  

To this end, and with the awareness that certain MS such as the US are already taking concrete steps 
to  better  protect  their  cyber  SASC,  this  thesis  provided  complementary  insights  and  analysis 
regarding the challenges at stake. Whilst the limited extent and semi-structured nature of interviews 
may generate results which cannot be generalized across the whole of NATO system and SC, they do 
provide detailed insight into and understanding of interviewees’ professional perception, experience, 
and  in-depth  expertise.  Research  results  clearly  illustrated  the  need  for  centralized  regulations  and 
streamlined  handling  of  this  SC  aligned  with  industrial,  well  proven  standards.  However,  those 
results  have  also  raised  the  question  of  how  these  considerations  should  be  implemented  in  an 
innovative, sustainable, and technical detail. In conclusion, this study aims to constitute a significant 
enrichment  to  existing  academic  literature,  as  well  as  a  valuable  starting  point  for  future  research 
encompassing gaps at the military SC nexus between cybersecurity and space and the future threat 
landscape. This includes AI being increasingly employed in space assets, which will NATO need to 
worry  about  both  cyber  doctrine  and  how  it  interacts  with  space,  and  AI  doctrine  and  how  it 
intersects with cyber and space. It is time to focus on SASC cybersecurity and safeguard NATO, MS, 
and industry from hostile interference.

ANNEX: COMPLETE INTERVIEW GUIDELINE 

The  following  is  a  complete  list  of  questions  as  posed  throughout  the  interviews  providing  the 
research  base  for  this  thesis.  As  becomes  apparent,  five  major  fields  determined  the  interviews:  a) 
General Introduction, b) NATO and military use of space, c) space asset cybersecurity, d) the nexus 
between space asset cybersecurity and their supply chain, and e) policy recommendations. Given that 
the  interviews  were  conducted  in  a  semi-structured  manner,  specific  questions,  either  based  on  the 
preceding  literature  research  or  key  words  that  prompted  additional  questions,  were  posed  when 
appropriate and with regard to the interviewee’s position, rank, company sector, general direction of 
answers, and field-specific knowledge.
