Abstract

Capture the Flag challenges are a popular form of cybersecurity education,
where students solve hands-on tasks in an informal, game-like setting. The
tasks feature diverse assignments, such as exploiting websites, cracking pass-
words, and breaching unsecured networks. However, it is unclear how the
skills practiced by these challenges match formal cybersecurity curricula de-
ﬁned by security experts. We explain the signiﬁcance of Capture the Flag
challenges in cybersecurity training and analyze their 15,963 textual solu-
tions collected since 2012. Based on keywords in the solutions, we map them
to well-established ACM/IEEE curricular guidelines to understand which
skills the challenges teach. We study the distribution of cybersecurity top-
ics, their variance in diﬀerent challenge formats, and their development over
the past years. The analysis showed the prominence of technical knowledge
about cryptography and network security, but human aspects, such as social
engineering and cybersecurity awareness, are neglected. We discuss the im-
plications of these results and relate them to contemporary literature. Our

1. Introduction

Training security professionals is a slow but steady solution to the global
cybersecurity workforce gap [1]. Educational institutions, computing soci-
eties, government organizations, and private companies are aware of this
situation and introduce new curricula, study programs, and courses. Cy-
bersecurity is an integral part of ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula 2020
(CC2020) [2], and specialized cybersecurity curricula, such as CSEC2017 [3],
have been emerging in recent years.

Along with formal education, an increasingly popular method of practic-
ing cybersecurity skills is via informal Capture the Flag (CTF) games and
competitions. In these events, small teams of participants exercise their cy-
bersecurity skills by solving various tasks in an online learning environment.
CTF tasks, called challenges, feature diverse assignments from exploiting
websites, through cracking passwords, to breaching unsecured networks. A
successful solution of a challenge yields a text string called a ﬂag that is
submitted online to prove reaching the solution.

CTF originated among cybersecurity enthusiasts at a hacker conference
DEF CON in 1996 [4]. However, CTF is no longer the niche of exclusive
hacker groups. This educational game format quickly gained popularity, and
now, teachers across the world are using it to complement education. CTF
has been used successfully in university classes [5, 6] and in undergraduate
security competitions [7, 8]. Even tech giants like Google and Facebook host
CTFs [9, 10] that attract hundreds of attendees every year. Unlike traditional
teaching formats, such as lectures and homework assignments, CTFs are more

casual and often include competitive or game elements. However, because of
their informality, it is unclear how they ﬁt into cybersecurity curricula.

CTF participants publish their solutions to the challenges online. They do
it to demonstrate solving the tasks and to share their knowledge with others.
The solutions, called writeups, are useful mainly in two ways. First, they
are a learning resource that describes how the challenge was solved, which
can prove useful in future CTFs and allow others to discover new solutions.
Second, the writeups inspire CTF creators since they provide insight into the
challenge assignment, even if the assignment is no longer available. We will
investigate a third possible yet unexplored use of writeups. In our research,
we regard them as a dataset and mine information about cybersecurity topics
from them.

1.1. Goals of This Paper

By analyzing the content of writeups, we examine how the informal CTF
challenges map to formal CSEC2017 curricular guidelines deﬁned by security
experts. We seek to uncover the breadth of the cybersecurity topics that
CTF can teach to enhance education and training. Speciﬁcally, we pose the
following three research questions.

1. What is the distribution of cybersecurity topics in CTF challenges?

2. How does the distribution of topics diﬀer between various CTF for-

mats?

3. How has the distribution of topics evolved over the past decade?

The ﬁrst question explores dominant, typical, and underrepresented cyber-
security topics within the analyzed writeups. The second question divides
the writeups according to the two most popular CTF formats and compares
them, allowing educators to choose a suitable format for their learning ac-
tivities. The third question splits the writeups based on the year of the
corresponding CTF event and searches for trends over the years.

1.2. Contributions of This Paper

Online CTF challenges feature practical assignments, scale to hundreds
of students, and include game elements. They are suitable for secondary,
tertiary, professional, and extracurricular education. This paper aims to sup-
port their further transfer into the practice of teaching and learning security.
Answering the research questions will be valuable for various stakeholders.

• Cybersecurity experts will know which cybersecurity skills they or their

team members can practice via CTF.

• Educational managers and curricular designers can see how informal
education via CTF helps fulﬁll formal cybersecurity learning outcomes.
Moreover, at a higher level, they can consider which cybersecurity top-
ics can be supplemented by CTF in their study programs.

• Teachers and CTF content creators may focus on more common cyber-
security knowledge to help students interested in CTF. Alternatively,
they can teach the ﬁelds uncovered by CTF.

• Students and CTF participants can better understand the content of

previous challenges and prepare for future challenges.

1.3. Paper Structure

This paper is organized into seven sections. Section 2 explains the key
terms to familiarize the readers with CTF challenges, writeups, and cyberse-
curity curricula. Section 3 describes primary and secondary studies related
to writeups, curricular design, and educational text analysis. Section 4 de-
tails our methods for the collection and analysis of writeup data. Section 5
presents the ﬁndings and answers the three research questions. Section 6
oﬀers practical insights and lessons learned from this research. Finally, Sec-
tion 7 concludes and summarizes our contributions.

2. Background and Terminology

This section deﬁnes the key terms used throughout the paper: Capture
the Flag in Section 2.1, writeups and their web catalogs in Section 2.2, and
Cybersecurity Curricular Guidelines in Section 2.3.

2.1. Capture the Flag and Its Formats

The term Capture The Flag originally refers to an outdoor game for two
teams. Each team must simultaneously defend a (physical) ﬂag in their base
and steal the other team’s ﬂag. Since the 1990s, this playground has also
moved to cyberspace. In cybersecurity, the term CTF denotes a broad spec-
trum of events with diﬀerent scope and format. These include online compe-
titions in attacking only, educational games with the instructional support
of learners, or games played just for entertainment at popularization events.

4

CTF can be hosted on various technical platforms [11]. The infrastructure
is usually online, making CTF suitable for distance and blended learning. In
fact, most CTFs are held remotely, although the participants can also meet
on a physical location (see Table 1). The most common formats of CTF are
jeopardy and attack-defense.

In a jeopardy CTF, the participants choose from challenges divided into
categories, such as cryptography, reverse engineering, or gaining ownership
of a service (pwn in hacker jargon). Each challenge is usually worth a dif-
ferent number of points, imitating the format of the famous television show
Jeopardy!. The participants solve the challenges locally at their computers
or interact with a remote server. An example task is that the participants
receive a binary ﬁle containing an encrypted ﬂag, which they have to recover.
In an attack-defense CTF, each team of participants controls and main-
tains an identical instance of a computer network, whose hosts run vulnera-
ble services. The goal is to patch the services and protect the network assets
while exploiting the vulnerabilities in the services of other teams. The scoring
is based on a combination of successful exploits and defensive countermea-
sures while maintaining the services’ availability.

2.2. CTF Web Catalogs

CTF participants publish their writeups on diﬀerent websites, such as
GitHub, YouTube, or personal blogs. We focus on CTFtime.org [12], which
is the most prominent web portal about CTF. Since its foundation in 2012,
this community-run project has been collecting information about past CTF
events, planned future events, team rankings, and challenge writeups. Fig-
ure 1 shows an example of a writeup (a step-by-step solution) posted on the
CTFtime website. It refers to the jeopardy challenge from Section 2.1.

Apart from jeopardy and attack-defense, CTFtime lists a third format
of CTF: Hack Quest. However, this term is rarely used [13], and according
to the available information, we did not ﬁnd any diﬀerence from jeopardy.
Therefore, we consider these two terms a synonym.

Table 1 shows that the number of CTFs listed at CTFtime increases each
year. This growing popularity indicates that more people participate in CTF
events. As a result, more data are generated that can be analyzed. Jeopardy
is undoubtedly the dominant format, followed by attack-defense. Moreover,
approximately two-thirds of CTFs are available remotely. The rest takes
place at a physical location (typically the ﬁnals). Remote CTFs are more
accessible to a wide range of participants.

2.3. Cybersecurity Curricular Guidelines

Curricula are formal documents that describe the knowledge and skills
taught at an educational institution. Prominent curricula in computing,
such as the ACM/IEEE 2013 computing curricula [14] and CC2020 [2], in-
clude only broad cybersecurity topics. That is why specialized cybersecurity
curricula started to emerge (see [15, 16] for a detailed overview). Among
these, we chose the Cybersecurity Curricular Guidelines (CSEC2017) devel-
oped by The Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education [3] because they
are widely established in the ﬁeld.

CSEC2017 deﬁnes eight Knowledge Areas (KAs) in cybersecurity. Each

KA encompasses diﬀerent skills and knowledge.

1. Data security includes cryptography, forensics, data integrity, and au-

thentication.

2. Software security focuses on secure programming, testing, and other

aspects of software development.

3. Component security deals with the security of components integrated
into larger systems, including their design and reverse engineering.

Table 1: The numbers of all CTF events posted on CTFtime.org [12] from January 1,
2012, to October 9, 2020, divided according to the game format and location. Since the
year 2020 is incomplete, it has fewer events so far. The small number of on-site events in
2020 is probably due to worldwide COVID-19 restrictions.

4. Connection security encompasses network services, defense, and at-

tacks.

5. System security aims at securing a system as a whole, including access

control and penetration testing.

6. Human security is about protecting individuals’ identity, data, and
privacy. It includes social engineering and cybersecurity awareness.

7. Organizational security governs risk management, security policies, and

incident handling at the level of organizations.

8. Societal security examines cybersecurity at the national or global level.

It concerns cybercrime, cyber law, and governmental policies.

Each KA is divided into Knowledge Units (KUs), which are further split
into Knowledge Topics. (Although CSEC2017 uses Topic, we changed it to
Knowledge Topic to introduce the abbreviation KT.) Figure 2 provides an
example of Data security KA. Its ﬁrst KU, Cryptography, forms the ﬁrst col-
umn of the table. The second column contains the names of the subordinate

7

KTs. The third column describes the knowledge and skills that belong to the
KTs. Overall, there are 8 KAs, 55 KUs, and 287 KTs. This paper identiﬁes
the distribution of the KAs and KUs in the writeups of CTF challenges.

3. Related Work

This section presents the related publications and explains how this re-

search diﬀers from state of the art.

3.1. Analysis of CTF Writeups

The closest research publication to this paper is by Burns et al. [17]. They
analyzed CTF writeups to ﬁnd essential skills and knowledge to study when
preparing to participate in CTF events. The work focused on 160 events

8

with about 3,600 solutions posted on GitHub in the years 2011–2016. They
analyzed the data to develop challenges for beginners, which are grouped into
six categories: crypto, web, reverse, forensic, pwn, and misc. Although the
article did not specify the exact details of analysis methods applied to CTF
writeups, the authors likely read and classiﬁed the writeups manually. We
aim to automate the process to achieve the results faster and more reliably
by reducing human errors. Moreover, we map the results to formally deﬁned
Knowledge Areas and Units of a cybersecurity curriculum.

In a paper by Chothia et al. [18], students of a cybersecurity course sub-
mitted writeups to CTF challenges they solved. The researchers manually
graded these writeups and examined the correlations of the resulting grades
with the number of submitted ﬂags. Moreover, they considered the writeups
as an indicator of whether students had understood the learning content.
Similarly, Schreuders et al. [19] and Leune et al. [20] instructed their stu-
dents to submit writeups of CTF challenges. However, the two papers did
not mention further analysis of the writeups. Overall, there was no published
attempt to map CTF writeups to a cybersecurity curriculum.

3.2. Analysis of Cybersecurity Skills and Curricula

Cabaj et al. [21] analyzed cybersecurity topics in 21 master’s degree pro-
grams at top-ranking universities worldwide. They informed how the pro-
grams cover cybersecurity topics and how the topics are distributed among
the taught courses. For the topic analysis, they chose ACM/IEEE 2013 com-
puting curricula [14] complemented with the CSEC2017 [3]. Their results
revealed the increasing importance of non-technical cybersecurity areas: Hu-
man, Organizational, and Societal security. In related work, Hallett et al. [22]
mapped the content of various cybersecurity curricula onto the knowledge ar-
eas from the United Kingdom’s Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge [23].

In a technical report from a European Union cybersecurity project [24],
96 universities were surveyed about which KAs from CSEC2017 they cover.
They identiﬁed that Data and Connection security are covered the most,
while Organizational security is covered the least.

Carroll [25] investigated the skills required in cyber warfare, speciﬁcally
for developing a workforce in oﬀensive and defensive cyberspace operations.
He surveyed 23 cyberspace professionals from the military, civilian, and pri-
vate sector about their core knowledge, skills, and abilities. As a result, he
recommends actions to improve the preparation for cyberspace operations.

9

Jones et al. [26] examined the essential knowledge, skills, and abilities for
cybersecurity jobs. They surveyed 44 cybersecurity professionals attending
the major hacker conferences Black Hat and DEF CON. As a result, they
suggest prioritizing knowledge about networks, vulnerabilities, programming,
and interpersonal communication. In related work, Haqaf and Koyuncu [27]
used the Delphi method [28] (a structured communication technique) to dis-
cover the key skills for information security managers. Finally, Brooks et
al. [29] analyzed IT security job advertisements to determine the skills that
employers are interested in.

In our previous work [30], we performed a literature review of 71 cyber-
security education papers. As a part of the review, we mapped the con-
tent of the papers to the CSEC2017. The dominant KA was Data secu-
rity. Other technical KAs, Software, Connection, and System security were
strongly present too. Nevertheless, Human, Organizational, and Societal se-
curity were not neglected either. Component security was the least common.

3.3. Analysis of Topics in Other Textual Data to Support Education

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a method for probabilistic topic mod-
eling [31]. Given a set of text documents, LDA discovers their underlying
topics, which are probability distributions over the words (terms) in the doc-
uments. LDA is a commonly used method that addresses the limitations of
probabilistic latent semantic indexing [32]. Marçal et al. [33] used LDA to
identify computing topics in questions asked on Stack Overﬂow. Similarly,
Rouly et al. [34] used LDA to analyze course descriptions in course catalogs
of diﬀerent universities.

Nadeem et al. [35] developed a method for recommending relevant reading
materials to software developers based on vulnerabilities in their code. They
statically analyzed program source code to discover the vulnerabilities. Then,
they computed the cosine similarity between the description of the vulner-
abilities and public articles in the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
database. To model the articles, they used a standard approach of Term
Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF) [36, p. 302]. It assigns
weights to the words in text based on their frequency and importance.

4. Methods

This section explains the methods we chose to answer the research ques-

tions posed in Section 1.1.

10

4.1. Extracting Cybersecurity Keywords from the CSEC2017 Guidelines

To identify cybersecurity topics covered by CTFs, we searched for cyber-
security keywords in the writeups. We began by extracting these keywords
from the CSEC2017 [3]. For each of the eight tables with Knowledge Ar-
eas (see the example in Figure 2), one author manually extracted keywords
from the third column, “Description/Curricular Guidance”. Another author
revised the extraction. Then, we repeated the process to minimize errors and
ensure the inclusion of all relevant keywords.

We gathered 1,623 keywords and organized them in a JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) ﬁle [37]. Its excerpt is shown in Figure 3, and its structure
follows Figure 2. KAs are JSON objects that contain other objects, KUs.
Similarly, KUs contain an array of KT objects, which then contain individual
keywords. To verify the ﬁle’s correctness and syntax, we wrote a JSON
validation schema [38] for it.

"Knowledge Area": "Data Security",
"Knowledge Units": [

{

"name": "Cryptography",
"Knowledge Topics": [

{

"name": "Basic Concepts",
"keywords": [

"encryption",
"decryption",
"sender authentication",
...

Figure 3: Excerpt from the JSON ﬁle with the cybersecurity keywords we searched for in
the writeups. Notice how the content corresponds to the curricula excerpt in Figure 2.

4.2. Downloading the Writeups

More than 969 CTF events with a total of 12,952 challenges (tasks) and
23,517 writeups have been posted on CTFtime since its foundation in 2012.
We focused on the writeups of events that took place from January 1, 2012,
to October 9, 2020, since 2012 is the ﬁrst year to contain any writeups.

11

for each event posted on CTFtime.org:

for each task in the event:

for each writeup of the task:

download the text of the writeup

Figure 4: Pseudocode for downloading the writeups.

To download the content of the writeups, we used the Python requests
library [39] to implement the algorithm sketched in Figure 4.

Downloading the writeup text diﬀered based on the content of the writeup.

There were three possibilities:

1. The writeup text was present directly on the CTFtime webpage. In

this case, we simply scraped it.

2. The writeup included only a link to an external website. If the website
was GitHub, which was the most common case, we followed the link.
Then, if the text contained at least one keyword, we scraped the raw
ﬁle content. For other websites, such as the authors’ blogs, we ignored
the link. The reason was that each website had a diﬀerent structure,
so automating the download would be time-consuming.

3. The writeup included a combination of the text and an external link. If
the external link was not on GitHub, we scraped the text as in option 1.
If the external link was on GitHub, we scraped both the CTFtime
text (option 1) and the GitHub text (option 2). Then, we counted
the cybersecurity keywords in both ﬁles and kept the ﬁle with more
keywords since we considered it more representative. Often, CTFtime
included a sketch of the writeup (its subset) and GitHub its full text.

Then, we performed data cleaning, such as removing HTML tags and links
to external websites. After the cleaning, we discarded writeups shorter than
two characters because our shortest keyword was two characters long. The
remaining writeups were categorized by year and format and saved as a text
ﬁle. Altogether, these ﬁles act as the input for the analysis (see Section 4.3).
Table 2 shows the resulting number of downloaded writeups categorized
by years and format. All the events we worked with are jeopardy or attack-
defense. Although 19 events were Hack Quests, none contained any writeup,
so we excluded them.

Table 2: The numbers of downloaded and subsequently analyzed writeups posted on
CTFtime.org [12] from January 1, 2012, to October 9, 2020.

Several factors caused the diﬀerence between the total number of writeups
(23,517) and the downloaded writeups (15,963). The most common one was
that the writeup was linked on an external website or written in a PDF,
which we did not parse. In rare cases, the writeup was empty, deleted by the
author, or did not pass through the data cleaning process.

4.3. Analyzing the Downloaded Writeups to Identify the Keywords

Figure 5 shows an overview of all entities that take part in the analysis.
The analysis script takes two inputs: the keywords ﬁle and the downloaded
writeups. Each writeup is represented using a Bag of words model [40], so
the order of the words is disregarded, and we count the keywords in each
writeup. Formally, we deﬁne the analysis as follows.

4.3.1. Input for the Analysis Script

The script for analyzing the writeups has two inputs:

• K = {k1, . . . , kn}, a set of N keywords. We deﬁned N = 1,623 key-
words. Each ki belongs to exactly one KT, which belongs to exactly
one KU, which belongs to exactly one KA.

• W = {w1, . . . , wm}, a set of M writeups. Overall, M = 15,963. W is
partitioned into subsets for the second and third research questions.

4.3.2. Counting the Keyword Frequencies

Given W and K, the goal is to compute C = (cij), an M × N matrix,
where each cij is the count of occurrences of keyword kj in writeup wi. The
value cij is further referred to as Term Frequency (TF). Figure 6 shows an
illustrative example of counting the keywords in the writeups.

Figure 6: Example of counting the keyword frequencies in the writeups.

Note that the matrix will be sparse; it will contain a zero value for each
keyword that does not occur in the writeup wi. Since each writeup explains

14

the solution to a single challenge, it is extremely unlikely that many of the
1,623 keywords would be present in a single writeup.

When counting the keywords in writeups, the matching is always case
insensitive because the writeups are often informal and written in lowercase.
Moreover, two additional rules are applied. If the keyword is an abbreviation,
such as LAN (for Local Area Network), we seek its exact match. However, if
the keyword is not an abbreviation, we seek only its stem [41]. For example,
if our deﬁned keyword is “encryption”, and the writeup contains the word
“encrypting”, we consider it a match.

4.3.3. Normalizing the Term Frequencies

The writeups have diﬀerent lengths. Naturally, it is more likely for longer
writeups to include more keywords. Therefore, to eliminate the bias of longer
writeups over the shorter ones, we need to normalize the TF values. We could
normalize by dividing each TF by the length of the writeup, but this would
give us impractically small numbers. Therefore, we decided to divide all TF
values by their sum within each row. For example:

w1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1] normalization

−−−−−−−→ [0, 0, 1

5, 0, 0, 0, 3

5, 1
5]

This normalization yields a value we call the Normalized Term Frequency
(NTF), which has multiple beneﬁts. First, it maps all the values in the matrix
C to a common range [0, 1]. Second, it preserves the relative diﬀerences
between the original TF values. Third, the NTF values sum to 1 for each
writeup wi, and so can be easily represented by percentages.

4.3.4. Assigning the Writeups to KUs and KAs

The process of assigning a writeup wi to a KU is as follows. Each KU is
assigned the sum of NTFs of its respective keywords. For example, suppose
that KU1 contains keywords k1, k2, k3. Then ci1 + ci2 + ci3 is assigned to
KU1. Returning to the example matrix in Figure 6, given only the writeup
w1, KU1 would receive the value 1
5

, KU2 the value 0, and KU3

This calculation is applied to all writeups and all 55 KUs. Afterward, the
assigned values are normalized by dividing them by M , the total number of
writeups. We do this to achieve the same beneﬁts as for the normalization
above. Finally, the process is analogous for grouping KUs into KAs. The
output of the analysis is the distribution of KUs/KAs in the writeups W .

5. Results and Discussion

This section answers the three research questions (RQ) about the distribu-
tion of cybersecurity topics overall, in the two CTF formats, and throughout
the years 2012–2020.

5.1. RQ1: Distribution of Knowledge Areas and Units in CTF Writeups

We now answer the ﬁrst research question by looking into the distribution
of cybersecurity topics in the 15,963 analyzed writeups. In total, we identiﬁed
232,160 keyword matches, corresponding to about 14.5 keywords per writeup
on average. Out of the 1,623 keywords, 1,012 were not found in any writeup.
The ten most common keywords were: log, password, exploit, encrypt, class,
pwn, http, decrypt, crypto, and reverse.

5.1.1. Overall Distribution of Knowledge Areas

Figure 7 shows the distribution of cybersecurity KAs in the writeups.
We can see that the analyzed writeups incorporate each KA to some extent.
The most prominent is Data security: among all keyword matches, more than
27% corresponded to it. The second place is taken by Connection security,
and System security is the third.

These three KAs are above the average of 12%. They are the most popular
probably due to containing skills and knowledge that are suitable to test
in CTF challenges. Data security includes knowledge about cryptography,
authentication, and secure communication. Connection security comprises
network services and defense. Finally, System security involves penetration
testing and multi-stage attacks.

Next, KAs Software, Organizational, Component, and Human security
have similar values of around 8–10%, which are below the average. The
third least is Component security, possibly because it often involves using
physical devices. This requires the device to be physically present next to
the participant, which is complicated and costly for remote CTFs.

The least frequent KA is Societal security, with only 3% value. This
is not surprising since societal aspects of cybersecurity, such as privacy or
cyber law, are not usually covered by CTF challenges. The creators of CTF
primarily focus on technical knowledge.

5.1.2. Overall Distribution of Knowledge Units

Table 3 lists the top ten prominent KUs we identiﬁed, along with their
key KT and a parent KA to provide context. Cryptography is the most
prominent KU, arguably because of dealing with ciphers. Tasks requiring a
participant to decrypt data are popular, and may also be used as a subtask
in various bigger tasks. Moreover, symmetric and asymmetric cryptography
are often core content in cybersecurity courses.

On the other hand, one of the 55 KUs was not present at all: Physical
interfaces and connectors. We anticipated this result since most CTFs are
remote and rarely involve the hacking of physical devices. Other least promi-
nent KUs are again mostly about physical devices or belong to the societal
parts of cybersecurity, such as Cyber law.

5.2. RQ2: Distribution of Knowledge Areas and Units in Jeopardy and Attack-

Defense CTF Formats

This section answers the second research question. We compare the dis-
tribution of KAs and KUs in jeopardy and attack-defense formats separately.

5.2.1. Distribution of Knowledge Areas in Jeopardy and Attack-Defense CTF
Figure 8 shows that the distribution of jeopardy writeups closely resem-
bles the overall distribution shown in Figure 7. This is natural, since jeopardy

writeups constitute more than 99% of the total (see Table 2). However, when
looking at attack-defense writeups alone, it is apparent that the distribution
diﬀers. The top three jeopardy KAs are Data, Connection, and System secu-
rity. For attack-defense, however, Connection security dominates, followed
by Data and Software security.

Connection security is prominent in attack-defense because this format
heavily relies on networking skills. By deﬁnition, attack-defense focuses on
attacking systems of opposing teams via a network. Typically, this requires
the participants to exploit network services, analyze traﬃc, or obtain creden-
tials for a remote connection. On the other hand, jeopardy often includes
standalone cryptographic challenges, giving rise to Data security.

5.2.2. Distribution of Knowledge Units in Jeopardy and Attack-Defense CTF
Again, the distribution of KUs for the jeopardy format alone follows the
overall trends in Table 3. Because attack-defense CTFs have few writeups,
they had almost no impact on the most prominent KUs overall. Out of the

top ten KUs in jeopardy, three of them belong to KA Connection Security:
Distributed systems architecture, Network services, and Network implemen-
tations. Data Security contains Cryptography and Digital forensics, and the
remaining KAs, excluding Societal security, have one representative each.

For the attack-defense format, Connection security has three KUs again
among the top ten (see Table 4). Data security contains Cryptography and
Digital forensics. Software security contains Implementation and Deployment
and maintenance. Again, the remaining KAs, excluding Component and
Societal security, have one representative each.

Regarding the least frequent KUs, we observed one KU not present in
jeopardy writeups, but 22 KUs were not identiﬁed in any of the attack-
defense writeups. An example in both formats is Physical Interfaces and
Connectors, and we add the full list in the supplementary materials [42].
These may inspire cybersecurity educators to design new types of CTF.

jeopardy and attack-defense is signiﬁcant. Before choosing a statistical test,
we ran a normality test on the whole computed matrix C. We chose the
Anderson–Darling test implemented in the Python scipy library [44], which
strongly rejected the hypothesis of the data having a normal distribution.

Due to the skewed data distribution, we considered only non-parametric
statistical tests. We chose the Mann-Whitney U test implemented in the
Python scipy library [45]. Each of the two CTF formats represents one test
sample with 55 NTF values corresponding to each KU. The test indicated
that the distribution diﬀerence of KUs between jeopardy and attack-defense
format is signiﬁcant (U = 1184, p = 0.02). However, we could not use
this test to examine the distribution of KAs between the formats. This is
because the Mann-Whitney U test requires at least 20 observations in each
sample [45], but we have only eight observations (KA values).

5.3. RQ3: Distribution of Knowledge Areas and Units from 2012 to 2020

This section answers the third research question. We look at the variance

in the distribution of KAs and KUs in the CTF writeups divided by year.

5.3.1. Distribution of Knowledge Areas per Year

Figure 9 shows that the distribution of KAs varies only slightly over the
years. However, the chart highlights some deviations. Data security had
a lower occurrence in 2012 and 2013. Similarly, Software security had the
smallest presence in 2013 and 2014. However, Component security was the
most popular in 2013. Connection security is steadily between 17–22% since
2015. System security peaked in 2014 and stayed at 7–15% in other years,
with Human and Organizational security repeating a similar trend. As for
the Societal security, it reached its highest percentage, 4.5%, in 2014 too.

Figure 9: Distribution of KAs in years 2012–2020.

5.3.2. Distribution of Knowledge Units per Year

Top ranking KUs do not vary much. Between the years 2012–2020, 15
diﬀerent KUs appeared at the top ten spots, and 12 of them appeared more
than once. The steady ones appearing each year are Cryptography, Compo-
nent design, and Network implementations. Those that appeared every year

21

except one are System control, Digital forensics, Distributed systems architec-
ture, Network services, and Systems administration. Finally, Implementation
appeared all years except 2013 and 2014.

We tested the null hypothesis that the medians of KU values through-
out 2012–2020 are equal to see if there are statistically signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences. We used Kruskal-Wallis test [46] to examine the diﬀerences in the
distribution of KUs, running it on nine samples (years 2012–2020) with
55 observations (KUs). The test concluded that the diﬀerence was signif-
icant (χ2 = 25.88, p = 0.0011). When running the test for KA distribu-
tions, the test stated that the distribution diﬀerences are not signiﬁcant
(χ2 = 0.26, p = 0.9999). Based on Figure 9, this was expected since the
diﬀerences appear small.

5.4. Limitations of This Study

The main limitation explained in Section 4.2 is that we downloaded only
15,963 out of 23,517 available writeups. Moreover, out of the 15,963 analyzed
writeups, only 8,688 (54%) contained at least one keyword. This eﬀectively
reduced our dataset, although it remained substantially large. The median
length of a writeup was 309 characters, and the average length was 3,979
characters.

Another limitation is the possibility of false positives in the keyword
matches. However, we randomly selected 80 writeups (about 1% of the 8,688)
and manually searched for the cybersecurity keywords in their content. Then,
we compared these ﬁndings with the results of the automated keyword ana-
lysis. The results were the same: the desired keywords were matched, and
no false positives occurred.
If more writeups were validated like this, we
would gain greater assurance that no false positives are in the sample, but
the process would be time-consuming and error-prone.

Finally, some may ﬁnd it problematic that the writeups rarely include
the precise challenge assignments, which would allow us to double-check the
relevance of the writeup to the challenge. However, the writeups were written
by experts and enthusiasts who solved the CTF challenge, and so we consider
them reliable.
In the future, writeup databases could include a separate
record of the assignment.

22

6. Lessons Learned and Future Work

We now share the educational implications of the results, their compari-
son with previous work, and practical insights stemming from this research.
Finally, we propose ideas for future work.

6.1. Implications for Cybersecurity Professionals and Educators

Cybersecurity topics are represented unevenly in CTF challenges. This
is understandable since some topics, such as attacks on encryption or reverse
engineering of code, have been a staple in CTF challenges for years. These
technical challenges are popular among CTF creators and participants, who
are usually cybersecurity enthusiasts from a private or academic sector. The
chosen topics may reﬂect their opinion on which topics are the most impor-
tant, are feasible to implement, or are simply fun.

Nevertheless, this opens a new possibility for CTF creators to incorpo-
rate human aspects of cybersecurity into the CTF format. Although phishing
attacks are a severe threat, as they are the biggest malware infection vec-
tor [47], our results indicate that the CTF format does not address this topic.
Therefore, preparing challenges that teach these aspects can be a valuable
and engaging experience, even for those without a deep technical background.
This can open up the CTF format for beginners and other users who are not
full-time computing experts.

Cybersecurity teachers can use CTF challenges as a suitable hands-on
complement to their traditional classes, as was previously tried in [5]. Their
regular classes may then focus on areas not covered by CTFs. Moreover,
CTFs are excellent for all forms of online learning, including distance and
blended learning, due to their remote accessibility. Finally, educators can
help their students prepare for CTF challenges. Prominent universities such
as Carnegie Mellon or the University of California, Santa Barbara, have their
prestigious CTF teams [48, 49].

Starting to participate in CTF is often frustrating for newcomers [50,
51] since the challenges tend to be diﬃcult. Knowing which topics are the
most frequent may help beginners to prepare and avoid disappointment. It
may even provide the basis for a CTF training program that would generate
recommendations for personalized training paths.

6.2. Comparison with the Results of Related Publications

We discovered that Cryptography is the most prominent KU overall. Sim-
ilarly, Burns et al. [17] also identiﬁed crypto as the top-ranking category of

23

CTF challenges, even though they categorized the writeups diﬀerently, not
using the cybersecurity curricula.

Cabaj et al. [21] found that most cybersecurity master’s degree programs
include Data security (e.g., KU Cryptography), Software security (e.g., KU
Programming robustly), Connection security (e.g., KU Network defense),
and System security (e.g., KU Penetration testing). This corresponds to the
most prominent topics we found in CTF, and also to those most researched
in cybersecurity education papers [30]. Among the non-technical aspects,
Organizational and Societal security prevail.

The survey of 104 European master’s programs in cybersecurity [24] re-
vealed that Data and Connection security dominate. KUs covered in manda-
tory courses by more than half of the surveyed institutions were Cryptogra-
phy, Secure communication protocols, and Network defense. When including
also optional courses or subtopics of other courses, these KUs were promi-
nent as well: Data integrity and authentication, Access control, and System
access. The least covered KA was Component security. Again, these results
are similar to ours.

For cyber warfare operations, Carroll [25] prioritizes networking, funda-
mental security principles, telecommunications, network defense, and man-
agement of vulnerabilities and risks. Most of these topics belong to the
Connection security KA, followed by Data security and Organizational secu-
rity. According to Jones et al. [26], cybersecurity professionals also prioritize
Connection and System security.

Overall, Data and Connection security dominated both in related work
and CTFs. These areas include essential technical foundations of cyber-
security, which supports the fact that CTF aligns well with formal study
programs. However, educators should not forget about the importance of
non-technical aspects, such as human security, privacy, ethics, and law.

6.3. Legal Aspects of Research That Involves Third Party Data

CTFtime website states that all writeups are copyrighted by their authors.
Still, it is allowed to analyze the data for research purposes and present ag-
gregate results as in this paper. In the USA, this is granted by the Copyright
Law [52]. In the European Union, the same exception for research holds [53].
The best practice in research is to publish the analyzed data and software
as supplementary materials with the paper. However, this would require
obtaining permission from the author of each writeup, which is practically
impossible. Without this permission, we would be re-publishing the content,

24

which the copyright does not allow. Therefore, we publish the writeup folder
structure, but the writeup ﬁles include only the link to the original writeup.
Similarly, we cannot publish the Python script used to download the writeups
because it would create a local copy of the data unauthorized by the authors.
However, it is a simple web scraper that can be replicated based on Section 4.
We publish only the analysis script, which is more speciﬁc for this work.

As a guideline for other researchers, we recommend carefully reviewing the
conditions under which it is permissible to publish third party materials. In
these cases, the support of replicable scientiﬁc research and the right to open
access to information clashes with the protection of intellectual property.
However, if the writeup authors and portals such as CTFtime used a Creative
Commons license instead of the traditional copyright, this would simplify the
future (re)use of their work.

6.4. Future Work

Future researchers can address the limitations of this study, such as down-
loading the remaining writeups, and thus improve the accuracy of our re-
sults. Probabilistic methods can be employed to match the keywords in
writeups stochastically. Another possibility is to apply machine learning to
the dataset.
In [34], the authors used clustering to “identify groupings of
similar documents according to their term frequency vector Euclidean dis-
tance”. The same method can be applied to writeups. If it reveals clusters of
writeups on a single topic, it can support the validity of our results. Finally,
classiﬁcation algorithms can categorize the writeups and compare them with
the CSEC2017 Knowledge Areas. This ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation would allow
mapping the CTF topics onto speciﬁc learning outcomes.

7. Conclusion

This work is a pioneering attempt to connect two diﬀerent aspects of cy-
bersecurity education: (i) popular hands-on challenges prepared by security
experts and (ii) formal study programs facilitated by professional educators.
If the goal is to exercise cybersecurity skills, CTF challenges suitably comple-
ment traditional formats of education delivered by schools and universities.
They allow hundreds of students to practice a wide variety of cybersecurity
skills online in a hands-on and engaging way.

We analyzed the cybersecurity topics in almost 16,000 written solutions
(writeups) of CTF challenges held in the recent decade. The goal of the

25

analysis was to determine how the topics deﬁned in the current Cybersecu-
rity Curricular Guidelines (CSEC2017) are represented in CTF challenges.
The analysis showed that topics such as cryptography and network security
dominate. Interestingly, the same topics are prevalent in the current study
programs and reﬂect the contemporary literature.

Although CTF challenges are excellent for practicing technical skills, they
do not address topics such as phishing and general cybersecurity awareness.
However, these topics are of utmost importance for mitigating the current
advanced cyber threats. CSEC2017 deﬁnes cybersecurity as “a computing-
based discipline involving technology, people, information, and processes to
enable assured operations” [3], but the interdisciplinary “people” aspect is
currently missing in CTF. This opens up a new opportunity to design CTFs
that would reach a broader, non-technical audience and perhaps attract more
people into cybersecurity.

Our paper provides numerous contributions for cybersecurity profession-
als, teachers, educational managers, CTF participants, and CTF designers.
First, we gathered insights into cybersecurity topics practiced via CTF. Next,
we discussed the implications of these results and connected them to the
state-of-the-art curricular development in cybersecurity. Finally, we pro-
vided recommendations for other researchers, along with the directions for
future work to motivate further research.

Supplementary materials for the paper are freely published on Zenodo [42].
The archive includes mainly the URLs of the analyzed writeups and the ana-
lysis script. This will support other researchers in replicating our work and
building upon the analysis of CTF writeups.
