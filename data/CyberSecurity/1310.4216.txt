Abstract—This work proposes a novel approach to infer and
characterize Internet-scale DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS attacks by
leveraging the darknet space. Complementary to the pioneer
work on inferring Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) activities
using darknet,
this work shows that we can extract DDoS
activities without relying on backscattered analysis. The aim
of this work is to extract cyber security intelligence related
to DNS Ampliﬁcation DDoS activities such as detection period,
attack duration,
intensity, packet size, rate and geo-location
in addition to various network-layer and ﬂow-based insights.
To achieve this task, the proposed approach exploits certain
DDoS parameters to detect the attacks. We empirically evaluate
the proposed approach using 720 GB of real darknet data
collected from a /13 address space during a recent three months
period. Our analysis reveals that the approach was successful in
inferring signiﬁcant DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS activities including
the recent prominent attack that targeted one of the largest
anti-spam organizations. Moreover, the analysis disclosed the
mechanism of such DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS attacks. Further,
the results uncover high-speed and stealthy attempts that were
never previously documented. The case study of the largest DDoS
attack in history lead to a better understanding of the nature
and scale of this threat and can generate inferences that could
contribute in detecting, preventing, assessing, mitigating and even
attributing of DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS activities.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A DDoS attack is one of the major cyber attacks that
attempts to make a computer or network resources unavailable.
DDoS activities, indeed, dominate today’s attack landscape. In
a recent report by Arbor Networks [1], it was concluded that
48% of all cyber threats are DDoS. Governmental organiza-
tions, corporations as well as critical infrastructure were also
recently deemed as DDoS victims [2]. A DNS ampliﬁcation
attack is a form of DDoS that relies on the use of publi-
cally accessible open recursive DNS servers to overwhelm a
victim system with DNS response trafﬁc [3]. A recent event
demonstrated that even a cyber security organization became
a victim of the largest (i.e., 300 Gbps) DNS ampliﬁcation
DDoS attack in history [4]. The above facts concur that DDoS
attacks in general, and DNS ampliﬁcation in particular, are
and will continue to be a signiﬁcant cyber security issue,
causing momentous damage to a targeted victim as well
as negatively affecting, by means of collateral damage, the
network infrastructure (i.e., routers, links, etc.), the ﬁnance, the
trust in, and the reputation of the organization under attack.
In this work, we tackle the following questions: 1) How to
infer large-scale DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS activities? 2) what
are the characteristics of DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS attacks?
and 3) what inferences can we extract from analyzing DNS
ampliﬁcation DDoS traces?

In this context, we frame this paper’s contributions as

follows:

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related work. In Section III, we provide an
overview and background information on DNS ampliﬁcation
attacks and darknet space. In Section IV, we present
the
proposed approach and elaborate on various aspects of its com-
ponents. In Section V, we empirically evaluate the approach
and disclose a case study on the largest DNS ampliﬁcation
DDoS attack. In Section VI, we discuss the lessons learned.
Finally, Section VII summarizes the paper and discusses the
future work.

II. RELATED WORK

First, the use of darknet to infer DDoS activities owes much
to the pioneer work carried out by Moore et al. in [6] that
was revisited in [7]. The key observation behind the authors’
technique is that attackers, before executing a DDoS attack,
spoof their addresses using random IPs. Hence, once the attack
is executed, all the victims’ replies (i.e., backscattered packets)
are bounced back to the fake IP addresses, which could be
in the monitored darknet space. Their work is operated by
CAIDA [8], which provide backscattered data for researchers.
Numerous research work has been performed on such data to
analyze DDoS activities. The majority focus on implementing
new detection techniques to infer DDoS attacks [9], tracing-
back the sources of attacks [10], investigating spoofed attacks
[11] and visualizing attacks [12]. Our work is different from
this category as their dataset is only based on reply packets
and do not include request packets such as DNS queries.
Hence, DNS ampliﬁed activities may not be inferred using
their approach.

Second,

the most
in the area of DNS trafﬁc analysis,
related work in this area is rendered by Oberheide et al. [13]
who analyze DNS queries that target darknet sensors. The
authors characterize these traces and propose a mechanism to
implement a secure DNS service on darknet sensors. Moreover,
Paxson [14] is among the ﬁrst to pinpoint the threats of DNS
reﬂectors on making DDoS attacks harder to defend. In another
work, Dagon et al. [15] analyze corrupted DNS resolution
paths and pinpoint an increase in malware that modiﬁed these
paths and threatened DNS authorities. In comparison to our

 
 
 
 
 
 
work, Oberheide et al. have not linked or investigated any
DNS DDoS traces through their analysis but solely focused on
analyzing DNS trafﬁc. On the other hand, Paxson and Dagon
et al. did not investigate darknet data. Therefore, all DNS
ampliﬁcation traces destined to unused IP addresses (darknet)
cannot be detected through their analysis. However, darknet
and other sources of data (i.e., Pasive DNS) could be associated
to extract further intelligence on DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS
activities such as the approximate number of infections. Future
work could consider the latter task.

III. BACKGROUND

In this section, we provide some background information
related to the mechanism of DNS ampliﬁcation attacks, the
darknet space and DNS queries targeting the darknet.

A. DNS Ampliﬁcation DDoS Attacks

A DNS ampliﬁcation attack is a popular form of a DDoS,
in which attackers use publically accessible open DNS servers
to ﬂood a target system with DNS response trafﬁc [3]. The
primary technique consists of an attacker sending a DNS
name lookup request to an open DNS server with the source
address spoofed to be the target’s address. When the DNS
server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead to the
target. Attackers will typically submit a request for as much
zone information as possible to maximize the ampliﬁcation
effect. In most attacks of this type, the spoofed queries sent
by the attacker are of the type ANY, which returns all known
information about a DNS zone in a single request. Because
the size of the response is considerably larger than the request,
the attacker is able to increase the amount of trafﬁc directed at
the victim. By leveraging a botnet to produce a large number
of spoofed DNS queries, an attacker can create an immense
amount of trafﬁc with little effort.

B. Darknet Space

In a nutshell, darknet trafﬁc is Internet trafﬁc destined
to routable but unused Internet addresses (i.e., dark sensors).
Since these addresses are unallocated, any trafﬁc targeting
such space is suspicious. Darknet analysis has shown to be an
effective method to generate cyber threat intelligence [16, 17].
Darknet trafﬁc is typically composed of three types of trafﬁc,
namely, scanning, backscattered and misconﬁguration [18].
Scanning arises from bots and worms while backscattered
trafﬁc commonly refers to unsolicited trafﬁc that is the re-
sult of responses to DDoS attacks with spoofed source IP
addresses. On the other hand, misconﬁguration trafﬁc is due
to network/routing or hardware/software faults causing such
trafﬁc to be sent to the darknet sensors.

C. DNS Queries on Darknet

On the darknet space, we observe a signiﬁcant number of

DNS queries that could be sent by the following sources:

•

Victim of Spoofed IP: In this scenario, the attacker
sends spoofed DNS queries on the Internet address
space using the victim’s IP address. All replies from
the open DNS resolvers will bounce back towards the
victim.

•

•

Compromised Victim: In this scenario, the attacker
uses the victim’s machine to send DNS queries. The
attacker might use several techniques to control the
victim’s machine, including malware infection and/or
vulnerability exploitation. This scenario do not involve
spoofed DNS queries.

Scanner: In this scenario, the attacker scans the Inter-
net to infer the locations of open DNS resolvers. This
task requires collecting information from the reply
packets and hence, a non-spoofed address is used by
the scanners.

In our work, we assert that high speed ANY DNS queries will
be sent from a victim of spoofed IP or/and compromised victim
but not from a scanner. In other words, scanners might send
ANY DNS queries to the Internet but with low-speed rate to
avoid receiving the ampliﬁed ﬂood of replies.

IV. PROPOSED APPROACH

This section presents and elaborates on our proposed
approach that aims at
inferring DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS
activities by leveraging darknet data. The approach exploits the
idea of analyzing DNS queries that target the darknet space
that were originally intended by the attacker to reach Internet
open DNS resolvers. The approach takes as input darknet trafﬁc
and outputs inferred DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS insights. It is
based on 2 components, namely, the detection and the rate
classiﬁcation components. We discuss these components in
what follows.

A. Detection Component

The detection component takes as input darknet trafﬁc and
outputs DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS ﬂows. A ﬂow is deﬁned as
a series of consecutive packets sharing the same source IP
address targeting darknet addresses. To achieve the detection
task, we base our detection component on analyzing DNS
queries targeting darknet addresses. These DNS queries are
attempts towards port 53. In order to detect DNS ampliﬁcation
DDoS, we built our approach in accordance with the param-
eters of Table I. In this work, we build on top of [7] that

inferred DDoS from darknet; we use 25 as a threshold for both
the packet count and scanned hosts. This permits the ﬁltering
of misconﬁguration trafﬁc (i.e., a host sending many packets
to only 1 unused IP address). Moreover, this veriﬁes that the
inferred DNS ampliﬁed attempts involve at least 25 distinct
open DNS resolvers. Note that, we could have also added
other parameters such as attack-duration and packet-rate
to our detection component. However, we avoid using time-
based constraints; we have detected some ﬂash attempts [19]
that targeted thousands of distinct unused IPs within seconds

and other stealthy scanning activities [20] that persisted for
several weeks.

In summary, our detection component labels a ﬂow of
trafﬁc as a DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS attack if it has sent at
least 25 DNS query of type ANY to distinct unused dark IP
addresses. Further, the ﬂow must have requested domains that
exist in our root and TLD database.

and statistical tools such as TCPdump. We abide and closely
follow the steps of our proposed approach that was discussed
in Section IV to elaborate on our analysis, which is based on
three main elements, namely, the characterization and a case
study. In total, our approach identiﬁed a total of 134 DNS
ampliﬁcation DDoS attacks including high-speed, medium and
stealthy attacks.

B. Rate Classiﬁcation Component

The rate of the attack is one of the major characteristics
of DDoS activities [7]. After inferring DNS ampliﬁcation
ﬂows, we noticed the existence of a large deviation among
DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS attack rates. For example, some
ﬂow rates reached more than 50 thousand packets per second
(pps) whereas others were below 1 pps. Therefore, in order to
understand more this large deviation and to group attacks per
attack rates, we executed a rate classiﬁcation exercise based
on the values found in Table II. We have chosen a threshold of

Attack Rate
Category

Value (pps)

Low

Medium

High

rate ≤ 0.5

0.5 < rate < 4700

rate ≥ 4700

TABLE II: Attack Classiﬁcation per Rate

0.5 pps to differentiate between low and medium attacks. This
value is used in [7]. However, instead of neglecting such low
rate attacks, similar to what [7] did, we adopt and exploit this
value to detect a sub-category of attacks; stealthy attempts [20],
which consists of slow scans that are generally hard to detect
through ﬂow-based detection and intrusion detection systems.
In regards to high attack rate, this category contains high rate
attempts that are commonly referred to as ﬂash attacks [19].
We have chosen a threshold of 4700 pps, which is the average
rate of the Slammer worm propagation [19], to differentiate
between medium and high rate attacks. In this exercise, we
assume that the average rate of the fastest worm propagation
in 2003 will have, at least, similar rates as ﬂash attacks in
2013. Please note that in general, worm propagation performs
scans for vulnerabilities on hosts in an attempt to exploit or
infect the victims. In comparison to the DNS ampliﬁcation
DDoS attempts, the attackers generate a similar portsweep
propagation attempts to detect open DNS resolvers and execute
the attack in one shot. The latter technique does not aim
at searching for a vulnerability to exploit, but instead sends
benign DNS ANY queries to abuse the open DNS resolver
services and amplify the reply on a victim.

V. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION

The evaluation is based on a real darknet dataset during a
3 months period, namely, February, March and April, 2013.
In general, we possess real darknet data that we receive on
a daily basis from a trusted third party. The darknet sensors
monitor /13 address blocks (i.e., ≈ half a million dark IPs).
The analyzed data consists of an average of 720 GB of one-
way communications to unused IPs. In regards to our char-
acterization tasks, we used several network-based monitoring

A. DNS Ampliﬁcation DDoS Characterization

In this section, we present the overall DNS ampliﬁcation
DDoS statistics related to our analyzed dataset. The overall
DNS queries distribution is shown in Figure 1. The outcome
clearly ﬁngerprints the largest DNS ampliﬁed DDoS attack
that occurred in March 2013 [5]. On the other hand, in order
to have a closer look at this attack, we depict Figure 2 that
illustrates the distribution of the queries for the month of
March. The average DNS queries arrival time per hour is
approximately 58050 packets. Obviously, several large-scale
DNS Ampliﬁed DDoS attacks caused some peaks at some
periods such as at hours 340, 400 and 517 in which the
distribution of packets was raised to 503995, 686774 and
798192 packets, respectively. More explanation on these peaks
are discussed in Section V-B.

queries. Note that the top 4 records are the same for the entire
3 months period. Further, in contrast with the results in 2007
by [13], that found that ANY records scored only 0.0199% of
the entire perceived records, we record 52.23% as observed
on the darknet space. As a result, we can safely assume that
the recent trend of DNS ampliﬁcation attacks are behind the
increase of ANY records found on the darknet in the current
year [5].

top requested domain belongs to one of the largest Internet-
scale DNS operators.

B. Case Study

Out of the 134 detected attacks, we discuss in this section
one of the major case studies that belong to a medium
speed attack. The latter is one of the major inferred DNS
ampliﬁcation DDoS in terms of size and impact. This attack
targeted one victim using 2 hosts (ID M1 and M2 of Table IV).
This attack scanned around 360000 unique dark IPs (68% of
the monitored /13 darknet), and hence could be considered the
most comprehensive compared to all other threats. Our analysis
linked these traces to the largest DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS [5]
for the following reasons: 1) in addition to the use of the ANY
DNS query , the traces of this attack targeted the ”‘ripe.net”’
domain name; this domain was used in the largest DDoS as
declared in a blog posted by the victim [5]; 2) the timing of the
traces from the host with ID 1 started on March 15th, whereas
those of the host with ID 2 started on March 17th. The two
mentioned dates could be found in the media [21, 22] and
were posted on Twitter on March 17th by a company support
personnel [23]. In order to depict this distributed attack, in

Figure 2, we highlighted the threat using a colored dashed-line.
The ﬁrst or/and second peaks are likely performed as testing
before actually executing the largest DDoS as demonstrated by
the third peak. Our result match the ascending order of peaks
as discussed by the victims [5]. This case study is probably
sent by an attacker using spoofed IP address of the victims
or using compromised machines; we unlikely consider these
activities as scanning events that are using legitimate addresses
(i.e., the intention is not to DDoS themselves but other targeted
victims).

In addition to performing several validation of our results
through DShield and the media, we execute a renowned
Network Intrusion and Detection System (NIDS) (i.e., Snort)
on the whole traces to see if we can detect such malicious
activities. The NIDS labeled 129 out of the inferred 134 (96%)
DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS as executing ﬁltered portsweep
probes. We have found that the 5 undetected attacks refer
to the low-speed (stealthy) attacks, which are, by default,
undetectable using a typical NIDS. In summary, we can claim
that our approach that aims at inferring DNS ampliﬁcation

NIDS. Further, our approach, leveraging the darknet space, can
infer DNS ampliﬁed DDoS activities while a NIDS is limited
to pinpointing scanning attempts.

VI. LESSONS LEARNED

From this work, we can extract

the following insights
related to DNS ampliﬁcation attacks: First, when compared
to previous years, we have found that the DNS ampliﬁca-
tion attacks are behind the increase of DNS queries of type
ANY on the Internet. Second, we have pinpointed that the
majority of the attacks target the root domain. Third, we have
encountered that DNS ampliﬁed attack rates can range from
very low to high speeds. High speeds attacks pinpoint victims
of spoofed attacks and compromised machines whereas the
very slow attacks reﬂects stealthy scans. Last but not least,
we have unexpectedly uncover a UDP-based mechanism used
by DNS ampliﬁcation attackers to execute DNS ampliﬁcation
attacks in a highly rapid manner without collecting information
about open DNS resolvers. Further, more importantly, we
have inferred that unlike typical DDoS attempts that scan for
vulnerable machines and then execute the attack, the largest
DNS ampliﬁcation analyzed was executed in only one step;
DNS queries are sent to the Internet with the intention to reach
open DNS resolvers, which subsequently trigger an ampliﬁed
reply to the victim.

VII. CONCLUSION

This work presented a new approach to infer Internet DNS
Ampliﬁcation Denial of Service activities by leveraging the
darknet space. The approach corroborated the fact that one can
infer DDoS attacks without relying on backscattered analysis.
The detection module is based on certain parameters to ﬁnger-
print network ﬂows as DNS ampliﬁcation DDoS related. The
classiﬁcation module amalgamates the attacks based on their
possessed rate. The analysis was based on 720 GB of real
darknet trafﬁc collected during a recent 3 months period. The
results disclose 134 DNS ampliﬁed DDoS activities, including
ﬂash and stealthy attacks. Moreover, the case study provided
signiﬁcant cyber security intelligence related to the largest
DNS ampliﬁcation attack. As for future work, we aim to
execute our model on a larger data set and implement our
proposed approach in a near real-time fashion.
