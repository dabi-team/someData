Abstract.  Within  the  field  of  biocybersecurity,  it  is  important  to  understand 
what vulnerabilities may be uncovered in the processing of biologics as well as 
how  they  can  be  safeguarded  as  they  intersect  with  cyber  and  cyber-physical 
systems, as noted by the Peccoud Lab, to ensure not only product and brand in-
tegrity, but protect those served. Recent findings have revealed that biological 
systems  can  be  used  to  compromise  computer  systems  and  vice  versa.  While 
regular and sophisticated attacks are still years away, time is of the essence to 
better understand ways to deepen critique and grasp intersectional vulnerabili-
ties  within  bioprocessing  as  processes  involved  become  increasingly  digitally 
accessible.  Wargames  have  been  shown  to  be  successful  within  improving 
group dynamics in response to anticipated cyber threats, and they can be used 
towards addressing possible threats within biocybersecurity. Within this paper, 
we discuss the growing prominence of biocybersecurity, the importance of bio-
cybersecurity to bioprocessing , with respect to domestic and international con-
texts, and reasons for emphasizing the biological component in the face of ex-
plosive growth in biotechnology and thus separating the terms biocybersecurity 
and  cyberbiosecurity.  Additionally,  a  discussion  and  manual  is  provided  for  a 
simulation towards organizational learning to sense and shore up vulnerabilities 
that may emerge within an organization's bioprocessing pipeline

Introduction - Importance of Biocybersecurity to 
Bioprocessing 

Work governing the processing living biological systems and their components 
falls under bioprocessing. This stretches from the initial research, to the development 
and  manufacturing,  and  eventually  the  commercialization  of  products  [1].  Biopro-
cessing  constitutes  trillions  towards  the  world  economy  and  continues  to  grow  as 
novel uses of bio products increase in demand, covering food, fuel, cosmetics, drugs, 
construction, packaging, and more [1]. As means of biocomputing, bioprocessing, and 
storage merge and become increasingly accessible and feasible, paired with growing 

 
 
 
 
 
 
appetites for green technology, the growth of the bioeconomy can be expected to fur-
ther expand [1-11]. Murch and Richardson point out that entire bioprocessing pipeline 
is  vulnerable  to  attacks  at  multiple  steps  along  the  way  where  bioprocessing  equip-
ment converges with the internet, which calls to need for additional scrutiny in design 
and  monitoring of  organization  bioprocessing  pipelines  [1,6,12-14].  To  do  so  other-
wise invites potential disruptions in the world’s functioning as the bioeconomy  grows 
[1,4].  

Much of the progress in bioprocessing will hinge on increased automation aid-
ed  by  advanced  algorithmic  processes,  increasing  engagement  with  Information 
Technology,  or  IT,  for  short.  IT  spending,  as  with  that  of  bioprocessing,  has  also 
reached  trillions  in  worldwide  spending,  with  the  expectation  to  continue  [15-16]. 
Paired  with  open-source  methodologies  being  both  profitable  and  adapted  world-
wide, economies worldwide are witnessing unprecedented growth in communication 
and digital technological development [15-23]. Further paired with biological compu-
ting and storage, technologies within the bioprocessing pipeline may witness shifts in 
development that will require new lines of expertise in operation and defense. None-
theless,  basic  means  of  protecting  data  and  processes  remain  essential  [15-23].  As 
entities engage advanced bioprocessing with aim to run lean operations, it is expected 
that they will employ networks of connected bioprocessing infrastructure, which will 
need a great deal of IT expertise for both management and security. For this, it is im-
portant  that  war  games  be  employed  by  such  IT  teams  to  simulate  risked  posed  in 
their infrastructure.

Importance of Emphasizing the Bio Component in 
Biocybersecurity 

The  primary  cause  for  the  development  and  demarcation  of  a  new  field  of 
study  is  that  biological  processes  are  no  longer  simply  the  end  result  of  data  pro-
cessing.  Biological  data  is  being  used  as  interlocks  (retina,  fingerprint  scanners),  to 
inform decisions (health monitors), and even as the data processing techniques them-
selves (biocomputing). Thus, in a biocybersecurity context, biological phenomena can 
act as interlocks, and even as facilitatory steps in a cybersecurity system. Biology, and 
its manifold aspects introduce numerous targets that can be exploited such as in sim-
ple behaviors exhibited by organisms down to the qualities of organic compounds that 
comprise said organisms. That is, transport of biomolecules within or between organ-
isms can be monitored precisely as well as the targeting of specific genes within an 
organism [4-5]. These can be examined and targeted on both macro and microscales, 
requiring creativity, but yielding potentially profitable results. For example, the actor 
can  examine  the  data  from  someone’s  Fitbit  to  determine  their  night  and  daytime 
activities, for deciphering their target’s lifestyle and how to take advantage of that[5, 
23-25]. The  same  can be  done  for  an  entire  community,  in  which  a  company  might 
want to gain additional data on diet or work patterns, to better  plan food truck loca-
tions. In terms of monitoring and targeting qualities, an insurance company can exam-
ine  one’s  genome  to  glean  and  set  new  rates  for  individuals  based  off  of  projected 
diseases that an individual may develop [26]. Although flawed, it is expected that the 
tools of analysis and their  predictive  power  will strengthen [27]. In time, as biopro-

cessing infrastructure leans on biocomputing, our societies will need to examine such 
biological systems in an analogous way. In terms of the bioprocessing pipeline, DNA 
can  be  used  to  encode  weapons  to  attack  machinery  that  interfaces  with  it,  but  also 
can  be  a  means  of  smuggling  [13,  28].  As  Peccoud  and  others  rightly  point  out,  a 
naivety  in  design  and  protocol  can  prove  disastrous  for  an  organization’s  enterprise 
[4,12-13,28].  Thus,  teams  are  encouraged  to  engage  in  rigorous  examination  of  the 
pipeline. 

3  WarGame Simulation 

Description of and Manual for Wargame Activity for bioprocessing teams: 

The following guide is a fast and  simple guide to doing a preliminary biocy-
bersecurity  analysis  for  a  bioprocessing  center,  or  any  facility  that  uses  biosecurity 
measures or uses large amounts of biological data: 

Preliminary Step 1 - Selection: Elect or appoint an individual to run the activ-
ity. It is recommended that this person has knowledge of Information and cyber secu-
rity, but any person with active interpersonal skills should do. The gather any individ-
uals interested or with a vested interest in security. Additionally, be sure to screen and 
update participants on knowledge of biology and biosecurity concepts. 

Preliminary Step 2 - Review: Review the  current active security procedures 
and  evaluate  participation  in  them.  For  instance,  investigate  how  many  unsecured 
devices  are  in  the  facility,  or  how  many  people  leave  passwords  out  or  computers 
unlocked. Now the activity can begin.

Step 1 - Training: divide the participants into 2 groups. The data defenders 
and  the  data  hackers.  After  reviewing  the  current  security  protocols  as  a  group,  a 
hacker and defender will pair up. The hacker should attempt to identify a given vul-
nerability in the current system. The data defender should then attempt to find a way 
to fix or “patch” that vulnerability. For instance, a facility that has users that frequent-
ly use exposed USB SSD devices can be made vulnerable  by a malicious actor dis-
tributing flash drives with malware on them. Potential defenses include having these 
devices in the facility, educating users as to the hazards they pose, or disabling inac-
tive USB ports. This section is meant to be an introduction to the key methods used- 
and should only last 5-10 minutes. Then have the participants switch partners, switch 
roles, or both.

Step 2 - Group Ideation: After a few rounds of training, several key ideas or 
vulnerabilities  may  become  evident.  Instead  of  patching  them  immediately,  at  this 
time,  two  groups  should  be  formed-  again  Data  Defenders  and  Data  Hackers.  This 
time, they should both be isolated, and allowed to envision defenses against the vul-
nerabilities or exploits pertaining to vulnerabilities of the facility (respectively). Self 
selection into the groups is encouraged, as long as both are roughly equal. Allow suf-
ficient time to ideate strategies, and supply materials like adhesive notes, whiteboards, 
and  other  common  office  supplies.  The  time  spent  on  this  stage  should  be  slightly 
longer than the training stage. 

Step 3 - War Game: This is the terminal stage of the activity. This section 
should be recorded in some way in order to analyze weaknesses and potential plans 
that  could  ameliorate  security  vulnerabilities.  The  activity  will  take  a  call-and  re-
sponse  style.  Align  the  groups  opposite  of  each  other.  The  hacker  group  will  an-
nounce  a  plan  to  exploit  a  security  vulnerability,  and  the  data  defender  group  will 

 
 
 
 
have to state a plan to implement mitigation strategies for that plan. This will continue 
until an impasse is reached or the realistic time limit is reached.

Discussion 

Common exploitations found in trial tuns of this activity have been the following: 

1.  The inefficiency and potential exploitations of security theater 
2.  The security implications of underpaid or unpaid workers 
3.  Miscommunications of conventional security threats 
4.  Lack of knowledge of novel types of threats 
5.  Security implications of sub-standard resources 

All  these  combined  illustrate  that  considerable  gaps  in  knowledge  exist  among 
potential staff concerning firms that deal in some degree of bioprocessing operations. 
Regardless  of  subindustry,  it  is  important  that  members  who  take  part  in  such  war-
games switch sides and remain updated on new trends within biocybersecurity as well 
as  separate  developments  within  cybersecurity  and  biosecurity,  as  both  fields  may 
have  developments  that  do  not  yet  materially  overlap.  Further,  these  war  games 
should be run frequently so as to keep staff in practice and cognizant of dangers that 
may exist. It is important to note that the style and order of wargaming can be varied 
to  suit  the  organization’s  need.  That  being  said,  it  is  suggested  and  encouraged  that 
teams vary their playstyle and introduce different scenarios. For example, the question 
of a wargame involving 3 or more opposing groups is worthy of exploration as can be 
imagined from the interplay of state-level actors, corporate actors, internal actors, and 
ethical hackers within.  As it is increasingly  apparent that IT and Bioprocessing pos-
sess a shared destiny in the years to come, operations both mental and physical should 
reflect that for optimal security.

Importance and Conclusion 

The primary importance concerning doing this as a group and as a facility in-
cludes the fast-paced nature of development in biology and bioprocessing. Different 
labs tend to have different requirements, tools, cyber-physical interactions, and work-
arounds. Lower funded labs may be vulnerable to more conventional means of pene-
tration. Labs with greater amounts of funding could be specifically targeted. Coupled 
with the fact that almost no research facility will have complete end-to-end supply of 
anything  except  the  most  basic  of  supplies  (for  instance  ethanol  or  double  distilled 
water),  interactions  that  could  be  used  and  vulnerabilities  and  exploited  for  penetra-
tion  will  always  exist.  Only  by  the  use  of  representation  from  all  of  the  invested 
groups will more complete security coverage be achieved.
