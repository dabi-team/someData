Abstract— In this paper, the issue of mixed-triggered reliable
dissipative control is investigated for singular networked cas-
cade control systems (NCCSs) with actuator saturation and
randomly occurring cyber attacks.
In order to utilize the
limited communication resources effectively, a more general
mixed-triggered scheme is established which includes both
schemes namely time-triggered and event-triggered in a single
framework. In particular, two main factors are incorporated to
the proposed singular NCCS model namely, actuator saturation
and randomly occurring cyber attack, which is an important
role to damage the overall network security. By employing
Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, a new set of sufﬁcient
conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is
derived to guarantee the singular NCCSs to be admissible
and strictly (Q, S , R)-dissipative. Subsequently, a power plant
boiler-turbine system based on a numerical example is provided
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

Index Terms— Mixed-triggering scheme, singular networked

cascade control systems, cyber attack, actuator saturation.

I. INTRODUCTION

In more recent years, cascade control systems have
grabbed remarkable attention from researchers due to its
numerous applications in many technical areas, e.g. power
plants, neural networks, chemical reactors, and networked
control systems. To mention speciﬁcally, this control algo-
rithm utilizes a pair of control loops, where the second loop
(secondary loop) is embedded with the ﬁrst loop (primary
loop). The ﬁrst loop is responsible to the system stabil-
ity, and the second loop is able to quickly eliminate the
disturbances [1], [2]. Nowadays much signiﬁcance is given
to real-time networked control systems due to the unique
features of reduced weight and power requirements, low cost,
simple installation and maintenance, higher ﬂexibility, and
easy reconﬁgurability. Therefore, it is vital to analysis the
combination of the cascade control systems and networked
control systems, known as networked cascade control sys-
tems.

Singular systems, also known as differential algebraic or
descriptor systems, have been vastly discussed by researchers
in the control society. The emerging area attracts signiﬁcant
attentions because they arise naturally in various scientiﬁc
ﬁelds, such as chemical process, economic systems, power
systems, electrical networks, and mechanical systems [5],

Technology, Taiwan, under grants MOST 107-2811-E-006-537 and MOST

[6]. Furthermore, despite of several advantages of singular
NCCSs, it inevitably leads to a few major issues, such as
time-varying delay, unpredictable actuator fault and exoge-
nous disturbances which formulates the analysis and design
of singular NCCSs very complicated.

It is essential to improve the communication constraints
so as to transmit the large control information by the limited
bandwidth communication network. To ensure the perfor-
mance of NCSs in practice and to overcome the drawback of
inadequate bandwidth resources, event-triggering communi-
cation schemes have been predominantly considered. In con-
trast to the conventional communication of time-triggering,
the former can be opted, as it facilitates to release the sample
data packets into the network more efﬁciently. Recently,
various works on event-triggering communication have been
discussed [7], [8], [9]. In the practical point of view, it
is necessary and important to consider the combination of
both time- and event-triggering, which is known as a mixed
triggered scheme [10].

It is executed by making use of random switch connecting
time- and event-triggered. Accordingly the implementation
of mixed triggered scheme results in enhancement of the
system performance and that minimize the network trans-
mission at a time. Moreover, the reliable control design has
gained signiﬁcance since it has the capability of maintain-
ing system stability and holds performance of the required
systems even though the actuator faults are present [11],
[12], [13]. Furthermore, the most of the real-time actua-
tors can distribute input signals of bounded amplitude only
because of physical restrictions which may lead to the
actuator saturation phenomenon [10], [14]. Recently, more
focus has been paid to cyber attack in networked control
systems due to its vigorously opening-up property of data-
transmission channels through an unsecured communication
network medium which are vulnerable to be disrupted by
ambiguity. Additionally, it can be classiﬁed as deception
attacks [15], replay attacks [16] and denial of service at-
tacks [17]. For example, the controller design problem is
addressed for networked systems with stochastic cyber attack
based on a mixed-triggering scheme [18].

Up to now, only a few works have been done previously on
control synthesis and stability analysis of singular NCCSs.
Some vital glitches in controller schemes such as stochastic
cyber attack, actuator faults, actuator saturation and distur-
bances have not so far been considered for singular NCCSs.
The aforementioned works motivate and draw our research
interest towards establishing a mixed-triggered control design
with respect to unexpected actuator faults and saturation for

 
 
 
 
 
 
singular NCCSs under external disturbances and randomly
occurring cyber attack. Some notable features of this paper
are encapsulated with unique aspects as given below:
(i) A novel primary and secondary mixed-triggered reliable
dissipative controller design is developed for the singu-
lar NCCSs with actuator saturation, unexpected actuator
faults and randomly occurring cyber attack.

(ii) In the proposed strictly (Q, S , R) dissipativity results
consolidates the results of H∞, passivity and mixed H∞
and passivity, which makes the considered issue more
general one.

(iii) Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, a novel
mixed-triggered reliable dissipative control
is devel-
oped, which ensures the admissibility of the proposed
system.

II. PRELIMINARIES AND PROBLEM
FORMULATION

In this paper, singular NCCSs with actuator saturations and
stochastic cyber attacks are considered with mixed-triggered
reliable dissipative control. As shown in Fig. 1, the structure
of the cascade control system contains two loops. The inner
loop is made up of secondary plant Σ2, secondary sensor
S2, secondary controller. The outer loop is composed of the
primary plant Σ1, primary sensor S1, primary controller, and
the actuator A. A network is assumed to connect the sensor
and primary controller in the cascade control system, which
constitutes the singular NCCS studied in this paper.

control for singular NCCSs

A. Cascade Control System

We consider that the primary plant Σ1 of the NCCSs is

described by

Σ1:

(cid:26) ˙¯x1 = A1 ¯x1 + B1 ¯y2,
¯y1 = C1 ¯x1 + D1w,
where x1 is the state vector of Σ1, y1 is the output vector, A1,
B1, C1 and D1 are known constant matrices with appropriate
dimensions, y2 is the output of the Σ2. In the proposed
system, the secondary plant Σ2 is modeled by using a class
of singular systems with state delay that

(1)






Σ2:

E ˙¯x2 = A2 ¯x2 + A3 ¯x2(t − θ (t)) + B2sat(u2) + B3w,
¯y2 = C2 ¯x2 + D2w,
¯x2 = φ ,

t ∈ [− ¯θ , 0],

(2)

where ¯x2 and u2 are the state vector and control input vector
of the Σ2, w is the exogenous disturbances which belongs
to L2[0, ∞), ¯y2 is the output of the secondary plant, and
A2, A3, B2, B3, C2 and D2 are known constant matrices
with appropriate dimensions. Additionally, the matrix E may
be singular and it is assumed that rank(E ) = r ≤ n, and
the function φ is the initial condition deﬁned on [ ¯θ , 0].
The term θ (t) denotes the time-varying delay and satisﬁes
0 ≤ θ (t) ≤ ¯θ with ˙θ (t) ≤ λ < 1, where λ is a positive
integer representing maximum time delay. Moreover, sat(u2)
denotes the saturation function of the actuator in Σ2, which
is deﬁned as sat(u2) = (cid:2)sat(u1
2 )(cid:3)T ∈

(3)

with Ξi denotes the known upper limits of actuator saturation
constraints in Σ2. The output of the saturation function
sat(u2) can be split into two sections which includes linear
and nonlinear. Therefore, the following saturation model will
be considered [10] in this paper

sat(u2) = u2 − Ψ(u2).

(4)

Furthermore, the dead-zone nonlinearity function Ψ(u2) sat-
isﬁes the following condition that there exists ε ∈ (0, 1) with
ε = max{ε1, ε2, · · · , εm} such that
εuT

2 u2 ≥ ΨT (u2)Ψ(u2).
In order to construct the suitable controller for the primary
and secondary plant, we design the following state feedback
controller as

(cid:26) ug

(6)

1 = Gu1 = GK1 ˆx1,
u2 = ug
1 + K2 ¯x2,
where K1 and K2 are the state feedback control gain
matrices of primary and secondary controllers, respectively.
In (6), ˆx1 is the actual state input of primary controller.
The reliable control law ug
1 = Gu1, where
G is the actuator fault matrix and it is possible to deﬁned
in the following matrix form that G = diag{g1, g2, . . . , gm}
≤ gk ≤ gk ≤ 1, k = 1, 2, . . . , m. When gk = 0,
with 0 ≤ g
k
the kth actuator fully fails, whereas gk = 1 means that the
kth actuator functions normally. For the sake of simplicity,
we deﬁne ¯G = diag{ ¯g1, ¯g2, . . . , ¯gm}, G = diag{g
},

where ¯Σ = diag{l1, l2, . . . , lm} ∈ Rm×m with −1 ≤ lk ≤ 1.

B. Problem formulation

It should be noted that a more general mixed-triggered
control scheme is established to reduce the burden of network
bandwidth, which is modeled in a probabilistic way by utiliz-
ing random variable to express the switch between time and
event-triggered schemes. When the signal is passed through

periodic and it will be transmitted in time. Furthermore,
the sequence of transmitting instant is denoted by tkh (k =
1, 2, · · · ), where h is a sampling period, tk (k = 1, 2, · · · ) is
a sequence set of positive integers, namely, {t1,t2, · · · } =
{1, 2, · · · }. Roughly speaking, when the latest transmitting
instant is tkh and the following transmitting instant is tk+1h =
tkh + h. Therefore, ηtk denotes the network-induced time-
delay of sensor measurement sampled at the instant tkh.

The singular NCCSs in Fig. 1 modeled with ζ (t) = t −tkh

and the sensor measurement of Σ1 as

¯x1t = ¯x1(tkh) = ¯x1(t − ζ (t)), t ∈ [tkh + ζtk ,tk+1h + ζtk+1),

(8)

where ζ (t) ∈ [0, ζ2], ζ2 is the upper bound of network-
induced delay. Suppose the random switch signal passes
through the channel of event-triggered scheme, the peri-
odically sampled measurements will be transmitted to the
communication network only possible when they violate the
condition of triggering. Thus, the sequence of transmitting
instant can be described in the event-triggering condition that

k Wek ≤ µ ¯xT
eT

1 (tkh + lh)W ¯x1(tkh + lh),

(9)

where ek(t) = ¯x1(tkh) − ¯x1(tkh + lh), and W > 0 is a matrix,
l = 1, 2, · · · and scalar µ ∈ [0, 1). The latest transmitted signal
is represented by x1(tkh) at the latest triggering time tkh.
Whether the latest sampled signals x(tkh + lh) are possible
to delivered or not depends on the condition (9). For im-
provement, the time intervals can be converted into many
subintervals, which can be written in the following form
that [tkh + ζtk ,tk+1h + ζtk+1) = (cid:83)d
l=0[tkh + lh + ζtk+l,tkh + lh +
h + ζtk+1+l], where l = 1, · · · , d, d = tk+1 − tk − 1. By letting
d(t) = t − tkh − lh, it is easy to obtain the limit of d(t) as
0 < ζtk+1 ≤ d(t) ≤ d2, in which d2 (cid:44) h + ζtk+l+1. Therefore,
the sensor measurement can be modeled as

¯x1e = ¯x1(tkh) = ¯x1(t − d(t)) + ek,t ∈ [tkh + ζtk ,tk+1h + ζtk+1).

In order to frame the mixed-triggered scheme, we intro-
duce the stochastic variable α(k) that satisﬁes the Bernoulli
distributed white sequences with E{α(t)} = ¯α, E{α(t) −
¯α} = 0, and E{(α(t) − ¯α)2} = σ 2. Based on the above
discussion, the modiﬁed mixed-triggered control scheme is
expressed by

˜x1 = α(t) ¯x1t + (1 − α(t)) ¯x1e.

(10)

is noted that

It
the cyber attacks are established by a
random manner. The nonlinear function f ( ¯x1) is introduced
to express the phenomena of cyber attack and its time delay
is assumed to satisfy 0 < τ(k) ≤ τ2. Moreover, the variable
β (k) is mutually independent and Bernoulii distributed white
sequence, which is utilized to govern the randomly occurring
cyber attacks.

ˆx1 = β (t) f ( ¯x1(t − τ(t))) + (1 − β (t)) ˜x1,

(12)

where Pr{β (t) = 1} = E{β (t)} = ¯β , Pr{β (t) = 0} = 1 −
E{β (t)} = 1 − ¯β , E{β (t) − ¯β } = 0, and E{(β (t) − ¯β )2} =
δ 2. Hence, the primary controller of (6) can be rewritten as

III. MAIN RESULTS

In this section, we obtain the sufﬁcient conditions for
stability and stabilization of the singular NCCSs (13) will be
derived by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method
and mixed-triggered reliable controller. First, we develop the
conditions which ensures that the singular NCCSs (13) is
admissible in the absence of external disturbances. Next,
this results can be easily extended to obtain mixed-triggered
reliable (Q, S , R) dissipative controller that guarantees the
stability of the system with known and unknown actuator
failures by using LMI technique.

where the parameters in the matrix ˆΛ are listed in Ap-

and
K2 = Y2X −1

, respectively.

Proof: We take actuator fault matrix G is unknown and
satisfying the fault constraint (7), the LMI condition (15)

Then by using Lemma 2.3, aforementioned condition (19) is
equivalent to LMI (17). Hence, the singular NCCSs (13) is
mean-square asymptotically stabilized through the proposed
controller scheme and strictly (Q, S , R) dissipative. This
completes the proof of this theorem.

The state responses of primary plant and secondary plant
are shown in Fig. 7. From the simulation results, the state
response of the singular NCCSs under the proposed con-
troller scheme and the H∞ controller scheme are given in
Fig. 8. We easily conclude from these ﬁgures that the system
trajectories converges quickly to the equilibrium point under
the proposed controller then the H∞ controller in [1] which
shows the superiority of the proposed controller scheme.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the mixed-triggered reliable control problem
for singular networked cascade control systems with actuator
saturation and randomly occurring cyber attack has been
studied. In particular, a mixed-triggered scheme is introduced
to reduce the burden of network bandwidth which is modeled
in a probabilistic way by using Bernoulli distributed random
variable to describe the switching rule connecting time
and event-triggered. With the help of LMI technique and
Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a set of sufﬁcient condi-
tions has been obtained for guaranteeing the closed-loop
singular NCCSs can achieve the desired results. At last, the
power plant-boiler-turbine system is employed to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

B. Proof of Theorem 3.1

Proof:

In order to prove that the nominal system (13)
with w = 0 is admissible, we ﬁrst prove that the system (13)
is mean-square asymptotically stable. For this purpose, we
design a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional candidate in the
following form: V = ∑4

We can get LMIs (30) and (44) are equivalent to the LMIs
(15) and (16), respectively. This implies that the closed-loop
singular NCCSs (13) is mean-square asymptotically stable.
Next, we will prove the regularity and the impulse-free
condition for the system (13). Here, we assume that the
matrix E and the state vector ¯x2 in the following forms:

ˆQ4 = X2Q4X2,
ˆZ1 = X2Z1X2,

, P2 = X −1

and

¯x2 =

(cid:21)

(cid:20) ¯x21
¯x22

where ¯x21 ∈ Rr and ¯x22 ∈ R(n−r).
It follows from (42) that

Ω14,14 = Q4 + ˜Q4 + 2P2A2.

(45)

Next, we deﬁne

P2 =

Q4 =

˜Q4 =

By substituting P2, A2, Q4 and ˜Q4 into (45), it yields that

(P24A24 + AT

24PT

24) + Q44 + ˜Q44 < 0.

Then, it is easy to ﬁnd det(s ˆE − ˆA2) = det(sE − A2) which
tends to det(sE − A2) is not identically zero and det(sE −
A2) = r = rank(E ). Thus, the system (13) is regular and
impulse free. Hence by Deﬁnition 2.1, the systems (13) is
mean-square asymptotically admissible.
