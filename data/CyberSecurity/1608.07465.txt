Mobile devices have become an inseparable part of our everyday life. They are used to transmit an ever-increasing 
amount  of  sensitive  health,  financial  and  personal  information.  This  exposes  us  to  the  growing  scale  and 
sophistication of cyber-attacks. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can provide unconditional and future-proof data 
security but implementing it for handheld mobile devices comes with specific challenges. To establish security, 
secret  keys  of  sufficient  length  need  to  be  transmitted  during  the  time  of  a  handheld  transaction  (~1s)  despite 
device  misalignment,  ambient  light  and  user’s  inevitable  hand  movements.    Transmitters  and  receivers  should 
ideally  be  compact  and  low-cost,  while  avoiding  security  loopholes.    Here  we  demonstrate  the  first  QKD 
transmission  from  a  handheld  transmitter  with  a  key-rate  large  enough  to  overcome  finite  key  effects.    Using 
dynamic  beam-steering,  reference-frame-independent  encoding  and  fast  indistinguishable  pulse  generation,  we 
obtain a secret key rate above 30kb/s over a distance of 0.5m under ambient light conditions. 

Guaranteed  by  the  laws  of  physics,  Quantum  Key  Distribution  (QKD)1–3  provides  an  ultimate  level  of  security,  and 
uniquely it is the only technology known to-date that can monitor eavesdropping activities. Since its inception in 1984, 
developments  of  QKD  has  been  largely  focussed  on  securing  large-scale  infrastructures4–6  using  long  distance  fibre 
transmission7–11 and free space transmission between fixed terminals12–14 QKD transmission has also been demonstrated 
from large mobile vehicles such as trucks15, planes16 and air balloons17. Today, there is increasing demand for security in 
handheld devices such as mobile phones and wearable technologies. A QKD protected link between handheld devices and 
the terminal would provide the keys for encryption with verifiable security for any wireless communication system, ranging 
from  indoor  wireless  networks  (e.g.  Wi-Fi)  to  access  control  and  near  field  communications  (NFC)  mobile  payment 
applications. This technology could also prevent ATM skimming attacks, where a $2 billion loss worldwide in 201518 was 
estimated, by transmitting the quantum encryption key from the mobile device securely to the ATM terminal. A  short-
range free-space implementation of QKD could address these security challenges and provide a high degree of security.  
For a handheld QKD system to be practical, it needs to be compact and low-cost19–21, and crucially, it must also be able to 
transmit a secure key in a time suitable for a handheld transaction (~1s). If the size of the transmitted key is too small it is 
not mathematically secure, so during this short span of time, a number of qubits large enough to overcome finite key effects 
must be exchanged22–24. The system must therefore provide a stable communication link taking into account the user’s 
unavoidable hand movement, which lead to translations and rotations of the mobile device. Previous work by Mélen, G. et 
al.21  obtained  intermittent  key  transmission  from  a  handheld  device  by  using  one-side  beam-steering  and  mechanical 
waveplate rotation in the receiver. Here we addressed these issues by using a novel agile dual-MEMS mirror-based beam-
steering system combined with a reference frame independent (RFI) QKD protocol to provide wider angular, translational 
tolerance and rotational independence respectively. This results in the first stable quantum link from a handheld device 
able to transmit a secure key in less than a second. 
In  order  to  compensate  for  hand-held  operation  instabilities,  we  characterised  typical  hand-movement  and  accordingly 
designed a system with optimal latency and tolerance.  Based on this evaluation, we implemented the system using MEMs 
mirrors for beam-steering at both ends of the link. Their orientation was controlled by a tracking system using LED beacons 
and Position sensing detectors (PSD) at both ends of the steering system. This implementation allowed us to obtain a wide 
angular coverage and minimise latency, thus guaranteeing the robustness against hand movements. 
The RFI QKD protocol proposed  by Laing, A. et al.  25, and experimentally demonstrated  by Wabnig, J. et al.26 allows 
polarization encoding without the requirement of aligning the polarization bases. In this protocol the qubits are encoded 
and measured in three polarization bases (horizontal-vertical, diagonal-anti-diagonal, circular left-circular right). Only one 
of those bases needs to have a fixed alignment between the transmitter and the receiver. As the circular basis is unaffected 
by relative rotations of the transmitter and the receiver in polarization encoding, it is therefore used to transmit the secret 
keys. The two linear bases can have any relative alignment and are used to assess the security parameters of the quantum 
channel.  Based  on  this  protocol,  we  demonstrated  a  practical  quantum  secured  wireless  link  between  a  terminal  and  a 
handheld device using a steerable optical link. 

 
 
Results 
QKD transmitter and receiver modules. The RFI QKD transmitter and receiver modules are represented in Figs. 1a and 
1b respectively. RFI QKD is based on the transmission and detection of qubits encoded in three bases. Here the qubits are 
implemented by polarization encoded faint pulses. In order to produce these 6 optical states, we use 6 resonant-cavity Light 
Emitting Diodes (RCLEDs, 650nm). The light produced by each of the RCLED is collimated and transmitted through a 
set of Polarizing Beam Splitters (PBS), non-polarizing Beam Splitters (BS) and waveplates (WP). The polarization of the 
light  produced  by  each  RCLED  is  thus  purified  and  rotated  in  order  to  exit  the  transmitter  in  one  of  the  6  required 
polarization states. The optical signal is then attenuated by a neutral density (ND) filter to obtain faint pulses. In order to 
avoid  side-channel  attacks27  the  optical  states  originating  from  all  the  RCLEDs  must  be  identical  apart  from  their 
polarizations.  This  means  that  their  spatial,  spectral,  and  time  profiles  should  be  identical.  Spatial  and  spectral 
indistinguishabilities are achieved by using a spatial filter with a diffraction limited pinhole and a spectral filter with a 
passband narrower than the sources’ emission spectra (see Methods).   Fig. 2a shows the resulting spectra from the six 
sources. Time profiles of the light emitted by each source was measured by a single photon detector collecting photons at 
the output of the transmitter. The resulting statistics, shown on Fig. 2b, exhibits a very good timing overlap. 

In the demonstration the RCLEDs were driven by a 6-channel pattern generator. Every 4ns (i.e. a 250MHz repetition rate), 
a 1ns pulse is generated in one of the six channels, this channel being determined by a pseudo-random pattern. The voltage 
level driving each channel is adjusted to ensure that the output power was identical for the 6 polarizations. The power was 
then reduced to 0.07 photons per pulse with a neutral density (ND) filter. This value was chosen to obtain a  sufficiently 
small probability for a pulse to contain more than one photon (see Methods).

filter. (b) Arrival time statistics for photons generated by each RC-LED. The x-axis is the delay between the synchronisation signal 
and the photon detections.  

The receiver module (Fig. 1b) has a similar structure to the transmitter. First, the light is spectrally filtered with the same 
passband as the transmitter filter. Then, light propagates through the same PBS, BS and WP arrangement as the transmitter, 
which splits the light according to its polarization and distributes it to six different channels. Light is then coupled into six 
lensed multimode fibres, which are connected to the Silicon Avalanche Photo-Detectors (SiAPD) used for photon counting.  

Agile  beam-steering  module.  The  beam-steering  module  must  compensate  for  hand  movement,  and  ensure  that  the 
angular misalignment of the transmitter and receiver remains within the field of view of the QKD communications system. 
The angular fluctuations of typical hand movements were analysed by measuring the position of a hand-held laser pointer 
spot as a function of time. Fig. 3a shows the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the angle created 
by  hand-movement.  This  indicates  the  speed  at  which  any  correction  must  be  made  to  the  field  of  view  of  the  optical 
system.  Our  receiver’s  the  field  of  view,  which  is  set  by  the  numerical  aperture  of  the  lensed  multimode  fibres  and 
associated optics, is 0.1 degree. This means that corrections must be made within approximately 42ms. 

Different techniques can be used to allow the terminals to locate each other before communication. The QKD signal is too 
weak for tracking. Using wavelength-division-multiplexing, two beacon signals are added to system to allow simultaneous 
tracking and QKD operation. To minimise the system latency,  a scheme using independent LED beacons is used here. 
Each terminal has a beacon that indicates its position, and a position sensitive detector (PSD) to measure the location of 
the beacon on the other terminal. This dual beacon system allows the two terminals to track each other independently, 
resulting in low-latency. Fig. 1c shows the system  we  used for dynamic beam-steering. A green LED beacon (520nm) 
aligned with the QKD optical mode is used in the transmitter, to indicate its position to the receiver, allowing it to perform 
adjustment of its field of  view. For the receiver to evaluate the  transmitter’s position, light  from the beacon enters the 
receiver and is diverted to a PSD via a MEMs steering mirror. The PSD then measures the angle of arrival of the beacon 
light, creating a signal that steers the MEMs mirror until the beacon light is centred on the PSD. This sets the receiver 
mirror angles so that photons coming from the direction of the QKD transmitter will be coupled into the lensed fibres. The 
receiver also has a co-aligned infrared LED beacon (850nm), which allows the transmitter to orientate its MEMs mirror 
and steer the QKD photons towards the receiver. In operation, coverage of +/-4o was achieved, as shown in Fig. 3b.

QKD performance  evaluation. Initial static tests  were undertaken, for different steering angles. It  was found  that the 
optical elements in the beam-steering system (and to a small extent the beam splitters inside the transmitter and the receiver) 
introduced  an  undesired  birefringence  leading  to  polarization  rotations  of  the  QKD  beams.  RFI  QKD  is  tolerant  to 
polarization rotations, but not to ellipticity alterations, so a WP was added inside the beam-steering modules to compensate 
for this. The induced birefringence was also dependent on the MEMS mirror angle, which varies, and therefore cannot be 
compensated  with a  static WP, but it  was found that  the  increase  in  the error rate remained  within 3% over the  whole 
steering range. 

In order to ensure absolute secrecy of the  transmitted key, the raw key that is transmitted with the circularly polarized 
photons  needs  to  be  processed  using  error  correction  and  privacy  amplification  codes.  These  reduce  the  key  size  to  a 
fraction  of  its  original  size,  called  the  secure  key  fraction. This  secure  key  fraction  is  calculated  based  on  correlations 
between the number of photons transmitted in each polarization state and the number of detections in each receiver channel, 
using the  method described in  the Methods section (based on Wabnig, J. et al.26). These calculations take into account 
potential polarization impurity and non-orthogonality and it includes finite key analysis. 

In order to demonstrate the robustness of our system against axial rotations (i.e. rotations around the transmission direction) 
we  introduced a rotating half-wave plate between  the emitter and the receiver,  which is  equivalent to a rotation of the 
transmitter  by  an  angle  equal  to  twice  the  value  of  the  waveplate  angle.  The  secure  key  fraction  as  a  function  of  the 
equivalent rotation angle is shown on Fig. 4. Here the secure key fraction was calculated for 0.5s key transmissions. We 
can see that not only transmission of secure keys was possible for any angle but the secure key fraction remained between 
40% and 60% over a 360 degree rotation. The secure key fraction was also calculated by using the BB84 protocol with the 
same photon counts, and therefore keeping two bases out of three to calculate the key fraction. In this case we can see that 
the system performances would drop very quickly with the transmitter angle. RFI protocols is superior to BB84 for each 
point except for the angle of 170 degrees. This is due to the fact that the calculation we used for the BB84 curves assumes 
perfect  polarization  orthogonality,  while  our  RFI  calculation  takes  the  most  pessimistic  possibility  without  assuming 
perfect polarization. 

Figure 4 | Robustness of RFI protocol against axial rotation. The secure key fraction (ratio between the raw key length and the 
error corrected, privacy amplified key length) is plotted as a function of the relative axial angle between the transmitter and the receiver. 
The values were calculated from a 0.5s data transmission for each point, for a fixed position of the terminals. The relative axial angle 
between the transmitter and the receiver was simulated by rotating a half-wave plate between the terminals.  

Rotations around the other axes induced small modifications of the photons’ polarization but with minor effects on the 
secure key fraction. The secure key fraction over the whole possible range of deflection of the mirrors remained between 
35% and 65%.  

The system operates in normal ambient light conditions (>400 lux from incandescent light bulbs). The detector dark count 
rate is 370 counts/s per detector,  and the noise due to ambient light was 600 photons/s per detector. The beacon LEDs 
additionally contribute approximately 570 photons/s per detector. These numbers are small compared to the ~1M photons/s 
that are detected for the QKD link, and induced error rate due to these impairments is negligible.  

 Quantum Key Distribution from a handheld device was demonstrated by holding the transmitter and pointing it at a static 
receiver. The whole optical assembly including the QKD and beam steering modules were part of the mobile handheld 
device, while the electrical instruments were static and connected to the handheld part by cables. Two sets of experiments 
were performed. First, in order to illustrate the fluctuations of the  asymptotic key rate in real time, measurements were 
performed  while  the  experimenter  holding  the  device  performed  a  series  of  voluntary  movements.  To  calculate  this 

 
 
 
asymptotic key rate, short (4ms) samples of QKD transmission were collected every 100ms, which is the time required to 
process the photon arrival times. Fig. 5a shows the vertical and horizontal angles of the two MEMS mirrors as well as the 
axial angle. Mirror angles were derived from the applied voltage while the axial angle was derived from the photon statistics, 
which depend on the polarization angle (see Methods). The alignment system was switched on after 4s, and no data was 
received before this point. Then we can see that the experimenter moves the transmitter up, down, left, right and finally 
performs an axial rotation. 

Figure 5 | Hand-held QKD performance. These measurements were performed while the experimenter holding the QKD 
transmitter displaces it in the directions shown. The motion compensation system was switched on after 4s.  (a)Vertical and 
horizontal angles of the two MEMS mirrors as well as the axial angle between the two terminals. The mirror angles were retrieved 
from the applied voltage, while the axial angle was calculated from the QKD data. (b) Photon transmission and error rate. The 
transmission is defined as the number of detected photons divided by the number of emitted photons (i.e. 0.07 x 250MHz). The 
error rate is calculated for photons that were both transmitted and detected in the Z basis. (c) Estimation of the asymptotic key rate 
as a function of time. Each point was calculated from a 4ms transmission sample. 

Fig. 5b shows the transmission and error rate as a function of time. The transmission is defined as the total number of 
detected photons divided by the total number of emitted photons (i.e. 0.07 x 250MHz), while the error rate only takes into 
account the photons used for the secure key (i.e. photons transmitted and received in the Z basis). After starting the steering 

 
 
  
system, the transmission stabilizes at around 3% with a few short drops and the error rate is approximately 6%. Fig. 5c 
shows an estimation of the asymptotic key rate as a function of time, indicating a rate of approximately 30kb/s with very 
few drops to zero. Fluctuations in this rate are due to the short measurement samples. 

Second, in order to demonstrate the performance of our system during a real handheld transaction, including the finite key 
effects,  a series of 14  separate  measurements  was performed with a duration of 0.5s each,  while the  experimenter  was 
holding the transmitter without any intentional movement. The average value of the secure key rate, after the finite key 
effect is taken into account, was 45kb/s with a standard deviation of 10kb/s. These results show that our system can reliably 
transmit secret keys long enough to overcome the finite key limitations in a very short time. 

Discussion 

In this paper, we have successfully constructed the first quantum wireless prototype for handheld usage fulfilling finite key 
requirements.  The  beam-steering  technique  used  maintained  a  motion-stabilized  communication  link,  which  allowed 
sufficient secure keys to be transmitted with a high throughput under hand-movement and typical ambient light levels.  

A number of improvements are possible. An increased key rate could be achieved by using a decoy state protocol28,29,  For 
full mobile device integration, further miniaturization of the emitter could be obtained by fabricating the RCLEDs on a 
single chip and combining the polarizations with photonic waveguides as previously demonstrated with VCSELs20. The 
steering system could also be miniaturized by taking advantage of the fast improvements and size reductions of laser-based 
pico-projection systems30. 

The  success  of  wireless  QKD  technology  could  introduce  an  unprecedented  level  of  data  security  to  merchants  and 
customers  alike.  Making  QKD  economical  and  practical  enough  is  essential  to  overcome  the  adoption  barrier  before 
security  threats  start  to  appear  with  the  increase  of  computing  power  and  efficiency  of  hacking  techniques.  This 
demonstration of handheld quantum wireless prototype represents a major step towards real-world quantum security for 
mobile applications. 

Methods 
Fabrication of QKD transmitter and receiver modules. The light sources used in the receiver were resonant cavity LEDs (RCLEDs) 
with a central wavelength of approximately 656 nm and a spectral width of 7nm. In order to ensure identical transmission spectra, a 
spectral filter with a passband (1.5 nm centred at 658 nm) narrower than the RCLED emission spectrum is used to select the light that 
will be transmitted. The choice of RCLEDs over laser diodes or LEDs is important for this application. First, RCLEDs have a wider 
spectrum than lasers, without multiple mode structure. The disparities between the central wavelengths of the different RC-LEDs being 
smaller than the spectral width, the light going through a narrow band filter will be similar for each RC-LED (Fig. 2a). This is very 
difficult to achieve with lasers because they need to be tuned with a tolerance smaller than their individual modes’ width and filtered 
with a narrower filter. Second, RCLEDs can be modulated faster than LEDs, making it possible to transmit a larger number of photons 
compared to the constant detector noise rate and thus, increasing the key rate. The spatial filter was composed of a first aperture with a 
1mm diameter followed by a focusing lens (f=6.24mm) and a second aperture with a 5 micron diameter (comparable to the Airy disk 
diameter).  This  ensures  any  difference  in  mode  profile  or  propagation  direction  between  sources  is  eliminated.  The  light  is  then 
collimated with an f=11mm lens. Both the transmitter and receiver base plates were fabricated using aluminium terminated with modified 
16mm cage plates to house the spatial filter and to enable easy integration with the beam-steering system. Alignment of the receiver’s 
lensed multimode fibres was achieved using spherical bearings to give the degrees of freedom required. All components were fixed in 
place using UV cured adhesives. A 10dB neutral density (ND) filter was added after the transmitter to obtain the required faint pulse 
intensity. Waveplates (WP) were added in the transmitter and receiver steering modules to correct for their induced birefringences. The 
WP angle around vertical axis as well as the relative angle of the QKD and steering modules were adjusted to obtain perfectly circular 
polarizations in the Z basis. We also took advantage of the fact that the additional WP acted essentially as a quarter waveplate to swap 
the X and Z basis by rotating the QKD receiver module by 45 degree. This allows us to have the Z basis (used for the secure key) nearer 
to the receiver input. By construction this made the detection probability and the polarization purity higher than when the Z basis is at 
the opposite end of the receiver. 

Beam-steering module. Commercial Position sensing detectors (PSDs) and MEMS mirrors (ϕ=4.2mm) were used. For the mirror, larger 
area leads to longer latency, mainly due to the inertia, but leads to a better reliability by reflecting more off-axis beams. This PSD and 
MEMS mirror combination enabled a low latency suitable for an agile correction of hand-movement.  Diverging beacon LEDs (LED 
Engine  Inc.  520nm  for  transmitter  and  850nm  for  receiver)  were  used.  The  wavelengths  were  chosen  to  ensure  enough  separations 
between the weak QKD signal at 658nm and the strong beacon signals, and to help aiming to the receiver with 520nm visible light. 
Dichroic beam splitters of FF750 and FF562 (Semrock Inc.) were used. 

QKD secure key rate calculations.  Our security analysis takes into account that, in real implementations, not only reference frames of 
the transmitter and the receiver can be rotated with respect to each other, but also that there is always a degree of misalignment within a 

 
 
reference frame. This induces non-orthogonality within a basis and mutual  bias between bases. Our analysis also takes into account 
differing detector efficiencies.  This is achieved by using an explicit device  model and  minimising the key rate over possible model 
parameters. The calculation of the secret key fraction can be posed as an inference problem: given the measurements and a device model, 
what is the maximum amount of information an eavesdropper can possess about the distributed key?  

Following the derivation in Wabnig, J. et al.26 we can express the secret key fraction as 

𝑟 = 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 − ℎ (

1 − 𝐶𝑍𝑍 + 𝜎𝛿𝐶𝑍𝑍
2

). 

We  take  into  account  imperfect  measurement  devices  that  can  lead  to  a  large  number  of  additional  parameters,  such  as  non-
orthogonalities in the preparation and measurement bases and detector efficiencies, which can be collected into the vector 𝜶. The usable 
entropy is obtained as the minimum over all parameters 𝜶, 𝜆1,2   

The parameters have to obey the constraints imposed by the observations  

𝑓𝑖(𝑚) − 𝜎𝛿𝑓𝑖(𝒎) ≤ 𝑓𝑖[𝒒(𝜶, 𝜆1, 𝜆2)] ≤ 𝑓𝑖(𝒎) − 𝜎𝛿𝑓𝑖(𝒎), 

𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 = min
𝛼,𝜆1,𝜆2

𝑆𝑈(𝜆1, 𝜆2) . 

where 𝒎 is a matrix containing all relevant detector counts, 𝒒 is the corresponding probability of observing a detector count according 
to the device model, the 𝑓𝑖  are the functions defining the different constraints, the 𝛿𝑓𝑖 are their corresponding variances and 𝜎  is chosen 
to give a certain probability that the estimated usable entropy is too high. In our parameter estimation step we use a set of 21 constraints 
consisting  of  9  correlation  functions𝐶𝐴𝐵,   𝐴, 𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍,  the  six  probabilities  that  a  photon  was  prepared  in  a  certain  polarisation 
direction 𝑃𝐴±,     𝐴 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍  and the six probabilities to detect in a certain detector 𝐷𝐵±,     𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍. For each function 𝑓𝑖 we can give 
the standard deviation 𝑓𝑖 . To obtain the secret key fraction we need to subtract the observed relative entropy in the key bases from the 
usable entropy  

The full set of measurements enables us to calculate a reference frame independent key rate. From the detector counts we can construct 
9 correlation functions 

𝐶𝐴𝐵 =

𝐴𝐵 ,   𝐴, 𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍, 

where the 𝑚±±
In the case of orthonormal preparation and measurement bases, these can be directly identified with the qubit correlation functions.  

𝐴𝐵  are the four different detector counts given that the qubit was prepared in direction 𝐴 ±  and detected in direction 𝐵 ± . 

Each preparation and each detector are associated with a direction on the Poincaré sphere, given by a unit vector. Since we aim to use 
the  z-basis  for  the  key  bits  we  can  identify  two  preparation  directions  with  the  ± 𝑧    direction  on  the  Poincaré  sphere,  without 
overestimating the secret key fraction. Each direction is parametrised by two variables (e.g. azimuth and polar angle), resulting in a total 
of 20 free parameters. Different absorption may occur in the preparation channels, and similarly detectors may have different efficiencies. 
With six possible preparation directions and six possible detection direction this adds another set of 12 parameters. The quantum channel 
can be represented by a two parameter two qubit density matrix in a simplification over the more commonly employed Bell diagonal 
density  matrix.  This  results  in  a  model  with  34  free  parameters.  The  secret  key  fraction  is  then  obtained  as  the  minimum  over  all 
parameters that fulfil the constraints imposed by the measurements, e.g. from the correlators 𝐶𝐴𝐵; in our case a set of 21 constraints. For 
the number of detector counts approaching infinity the constraints are equalities, but for a finite number of observations the value can 
lie within an interval determined by the number of counts and the desired uncertainty. A small number of counts will lead to larger 
uncertainty in the correlation function and therefore to lower results for the secret key fraction. Finally, since we don’t use single photon 
sources  in  the  transmitter,  we  need  to  consider  the occasional  transmission  of  multi-photon  pulses,  which  could be  exploited  by  an 
adversary able to non-destructively detect those pulses and extract one of the photons. According to Poisson statistics, the probability 
for a pulse to contain 1 photon is approximately 0.07 and the probability to have more than one photon is approximately 0.072/2. This 
means that amongst the detection events we use to build the secret key, a proportion equal to 0.035 is accessible by the adversary, which 
is very small compared to the overall secure key fraction (~0.5). In any case, privacy amplification and error correction will use a key 
fraction slightly lower than the theoretical limit to ensure an extra guaranty of secrecy. 

Axial angle estimation.  The correlators defined in the above section can also be used to estimate the relative axial angle between the 
QKD bases of the transmitter and the receiver. Several combinations of correlators can be used to calculate the angle. This calculations 
based on single photon counts are intrinsically noisy. In order to reduce this noise a median of the different possible ways to retrieve the 
angle  was calculated: 

= median (  atan2(CXY,CXX)+45, atan2(CYX,CXX)+ 45, -atan2(CYX,CYY) -135,  -atan2(CXY,CYY) -135). 

The 45 degree rotation is due to the rotation of the QKD module in the receiver as explained in the “Fabrication of QKD transmitter and 
receiver modules” section of the Methods. This calculation being based on the photon counts, a low transmission doesn’t allow us to 
retrieve an accurate angle. This is why there is a missing section in Fig. 5a around 9.5 seconds. This corresponds to a transmission drop.
