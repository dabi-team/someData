 Abstract— Secure  and  fast grid  restoration  from a  collapsed 
state  is  increasingly  critical  as  blackouts  are  becoming  more 
prevalent  around  the  globe.  Generally,  the  restoration  of  grid 
during a blackout is achieved with the help of Supervisory Control 
and  Data  Acquisition  System  (SCADA)  based  central  control; 
however, with the threat of cyber-blackouts, this presumption of 
an available and secure SCADA system is not valid. This is also 
true  for  grids  in  developing  countries  as  well  as  for  many 
distribution and micro grids that lack SCADA. In this paper, we 
introduce an online framework for localized grid restoration that 
validates and updates a pre-defined crank path in real-time based 
on  the vital grid  states  of  voltages,  currents  and  frequency.  The 
proposed framework maintains an online network topology of the 
localized  grid  that  can  continuously  sample  local  measurements 
and update the grid model, thereby circumventing SCADA based 
central control. In the results section we demonstrate the efficacy 
of this framework for blackstart by ensuring a feasible crank path 
with  voltage  and  frequency  states  within  bounds,  while  further 
assisting in synchronization of two disconnected sub-grids during 
the re-energization process using a distributed framework.

I.  INTRODUCTION

lackouts are becoming prevalent threats around the globe 
affecting  developed  centralized  grids  as  well  as  weak 
fragmented grids alike. The advent of cyber-attacks [1] 
have further escalated the risk of blackouts in developed grids, 
while fragile grids remain susceptible to rolling blackouts due 
to  a  lack  of  energy  infrastructure  [2].  In  most  instances,  grid 
restoration  following  a  blackout  is  driven  by  SCADA-based 
central control, however during cyber-attacks the SCADA and 
Energy Management Systems (EMS) may become inoperable 
or even worse, compromised [3]. Presently, restoration without 
a  SCADA  and  EMS  requires  experienced  engineers  to 
manually guide the process. However,  such manual operation 
may  result  in  sub-optimal  restoration  process  or  damage  to 
equipment. Additionally, it may lead to delayed energization of 
critical resources such as hospitals, military  installations, and 
transport  systems.  Due  to  these  drawbacks,  both  regulatory 
bodies  and  system  operators  are  interested  in  methodologies 
that can help in restoration of grids under black start with no 
SCADA  [4]-[6]  and  they  underscore  the  need  for  robust 
simulation frameworks that can help achieve these goals. This 
was clearly stated in a report by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) in [4]. 

In  search  of  that  goal,  this  paper  develops  a  novel  online 
localized and distributed modeling and simulation framework 
that can assist in black starting a grid with a compromised or 
unavailable  SCADA  network.  We  term  the  framework  as 
Simulation  with  Unified  Grid  Analyses  and  Renewables  – 
Restoration (SUGAR-R) and is shown in Fig. 1.  

continuously 

This  framework  will  be  deployed  in  critical  distributed 
locations  (e.g.  Area  1  and  2  in  Fig.  1)  in  the  grid  and  will 
maintain an online network topology of the localized network 
by 
local 
sampling  various 
measurements  (see  sensors  in  Fig.  1)  and  mapping  them  to 
system models. These measurements will not be provided via 
the  central  SCADA  system,  rather  from  the  localized  meters 
through secondary channels (see [7]), thereby avoiding invalid 
system models caused by potential false data injection cyber-
attacks  on  the  central  EMS  based  system.  In  the  restoration 
process  studied  by  FERC,  collecting  state  measurements  in 
SCADA-less  environment  is  presently  done  using  personnel

support  [4];  however,  with  the  advent  of  IOTs  and  cloud 
computing, localized and cheap autonomous data collection is 
possible [7]. Nonetheless, this paper is not poised to determine 
the  acquisition  of  state  measurements  in  a  SCADA  absent 
system, but rather to use available local measurements to assist 
in grid restoration. 

Figure 1: Pictorial representation of SUGAR-R framework. 

The proposed online framework will assist in restoration by 
simulating the energization of sections of the localized grid in 
steady-state stages, known as the crank path. For a successful 
restoration process, the system during each crank step should 
maintain  feasibility  and  stability  by  ensuring  that  vital  health 
states (i.e. voltage, currents, and frequency) of the network are 
within operational bounds through proper matching of load and 
generation.  SUGAR-R  will  validate 
these  criteria  and 
recommend optimal corrective actions in case no feasible state 
is possible based on the pre-defined crank path. Once an island 
is  fully  restored,  SUGAR-R  will  use  a  proposed  distributed 
computing methodology with cloud or local interface to assist 
in synchronization of multiple islanded networks [4].  

SUGAR-R  utilizes  the  physics  of  the  grid  and  provides  a 
lightweight and robust framework for grid simulation that is apt 
for  studying  online  grid  restoration  of  distributed  grid 
segments.  It  is  able  to  better  model  system  states  by 
representing physical characteristics of the grid through natural 
state variables of voltage, current and frequency, unlike other 
previous  works.  For  instance,  [8]-[11]  considers  loss-less 
networks or uses DC approximations to represent the network 
flows  (neglecting  the  voltage  characteristics  of  the  line),  and 
often steady-state methodologies [8],[12]-[13] do not consider 
the impact of frequency. Frequency is an important variable to 
model while simulating grid failure modes, without which the 
effect of frequency-based control actions cannot be predicted. 
For instance, a recent power failure in the U.K. grid due to an 
N-2  contingency,  triggered  a  five  percent  drop  of  the  system 
load  by  an  automatic  under-frequency  load  shedding (UFLS) 
scheme that actuated at 48.8 Hz [14]. A steady-state simulation 
framework  without  frequency  as  a  variable  will  not  able  to 
accurately simulate this event.  

To robustly incorporate the effects of frequency, SUGAR-R 
extends  the  prior  work  of  SUGAR  [15]-[16],  a  robust  power 
grid steady-state analysis and optimization framework based on 
circuit-theoretic  approach.  The  circuit  formalism  within 
SUGAR  allows  inclusion  of  any  physical  measurement 
information into the network model in real-time. In doing so, 
an  operation  engineer  can  expect  to  use  SUGAR-R  as  a  tool 
during  the  restoration  process  to  validate  and  recommend 
modifications  to  the  crank-path.  As  SUGAR-R  is  not  only 
scalable  but  also  operational  in  real-time,  the  operation 

2 

engineer can turn to the tool to ensure that the grid will be stable 
after  any  restorative  action  they  are  about  to  perform.  After 
restoring their local network, the  operation engineer can then 
use  SUGAR-R  to  propose  a  change  in  dispatch  to  reliably 
synchronize with other energized networks. 

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows; Section 
II  describes  the  circuit-theoretic  components  required  for 
modeling  and  maintaining  the  online  network  model  of  the 
localized grid sections. Section III describes the optimization-
based  grid  blackstart  framework  and  demonstrates 
the 
distributed  method  that  assists  in  synchronizing  disconnected 
islands.  Finally,  the  simulation  results  are  discussed  in 
Section V.   

II.  A CIRCUIT-BASED LOCALIZED NETWORK FRAMEWORK 

The  goal  of  a  simulation  framework  during  grid  restoration 
without  central  SCADA  is  to  validate  the  feasibility  and 
stability  of  each  crank  path  while  also  assisting 
in 
synchronization  of  different  sections  of  the  grid.  In  order  to 
the  following  criteria,  the  proposed  simulation 
achieve 
framework must: 

• 
• 

• 

• 

introduce frequency as a state within the framework, 
clearly  distinguish  a  hard-to-solve  case  from  an 
infeasible (past the tip of nose curve) case independent 
of the choice of initial conditions,  
incorporate online local measurements into the network 
model  in  real-time  to  provide  accurate  snapshot  of  the 
localized grid, 
under an infeasible scenario, recommend optimal change 
in  device  settings  to  ensure  that  the  voltage  and 
frequency remain within bounds while satisfying KCLs 
at each node. 

To meet these criteria, this paper develops an online framework 
that can run light-weight optimization analyses while including 
the  frequency  state.  We  will  assume  that  the  framework  can 
collect  and  accordingly  update  localized  network  models  in 
real-time  (for  more  details  see  Section  II-B).  To  build  this 
approach,  we  will  begin  with  and  extend  a  previously 
developed  circuit  theoretic  grid  analysis  framework  SUGAR. 
SUGAR approach described in [15]-[16], is already capable of 
identifying an infeasible grid state (KCL not satisfied at each 
node  while  respecting  device  limits)  from  an  hard-to-solve 
network [17]. 

A.  Frequency Steady-State Framework  
To  robustly  model  the  impact  of  frequency  controls  on  the 
steady  state  achieved  at  each  crank  stage,  SUGAR  approach 
was  further  extended  to  integrate  a  frequency  deviation 
term, Δ𝑓  into  power  flow  while  implicitly  modeling  active 
power limits without the use of outer loops during simulation. 
This  enables  accurate  and  robust  modeling  of  frequency-
dependent grid components  and controls including the primary 
frequency  response  of  generators  based  on  the  change 
frequency Δ𝑓:

natural state variables of voltages, currents and frequency. To 
demonstrate this, we consider a linear BIG load model [25]-[26] 
as an example (see Fig. 3).

In addition, the authors in [19] have implicitly modeled the 
active power limits of a generator using a continuous function, 
as  shown  in  Fig.  2.  This  implicit  model  is  represented  by  a 
smooth first-order continuous function (with five regions) that 
eliminates the use of outer loops to model the generator active 
power limits, to significantly improve convergence and allow 
extendibility  to  optimization  framework  without  the  use  of 
complementarity  constraints.  The  proposed  SUGAR-R 
framework will be built upon this work and is further described 
in following sections.

to primary droop control [19]. 

B.  Use of Localized Measurement for Network Modeling 
To  accurately  model  the  steady  state  of  the  power  grid,  grid 
operators use SCADA to continuously gather all measurements 
and device statuses in a central location. With the help of state 
estimation  and  topology  estimation,  grid  operators  update  or 
develop network models and incorporate them into simulations 
to  further  study  real-time  operations  including  those  for  grid 
restoration. However, under a cyber-attack, central SCADA or 
EMS  systems  used  for  maintaining  and  updating  network 
model may be corrupted or compromised requiring an alternate 
methodology for network model creation and updating. 

In  our  approach,  we  propose  the  use  of  localized 
measurements  to  alleviate  the  likelihood  of  widespread 
disruption  due  to  one  central  attack.  Any  such  proposed 
framework  will  have  to  utilize  local  measurements  obtained 
through  secondary  channels  (independent  of  central  SCADA 
system), such as smart meters and other devices to maintain and 
update localized network models.  Newer frameworks that are 
independent  of  standard  SCADA  have  been  successful  in 
capturing grid data cheaply from wide array of measurements 
and making it available to a common platform [7]. For instance, 
many  such  platforms  were  introduced  in  a  recent  federal 
program focused on restoring the grid under a cyber-attack [20]. 
Such  platforms  by  collecting  grid  information  of  the  local 
network in real-time will provide the grid operators situational 
awareness  during  restoration process  [21]-[22].  However,  the 
implementation  for  access  to  such  localized  measurements  is 
not the primary goal of this paper, rather it is assumed that the 
proposed SUGAR-R framework can directly incorporate these 
measurements into its models.

(𝐵𝐵𝐼𝐺) and whose real and imaginary currents are given by (2).

Figure 4: BIG model representation of 12 days for the LBNL data; 
BIG model is clearly shown to capture the voltage variability of the 
load characteristics [26]. 
  Using techniques from [25], the BIG load model parameters 
can be fit with online streaming measurement data from a large 
variety  of  measurement  devices  (such  as  the  smart  meters, 
remote  terminal  units,  micro  phasor  measurement  units  and 
other IOTs) to accurately represent the nominal characteristics 
of  the  load  while  also  capturing  its  voltage  sensitivity. 
Moreover, these load models can be aggregated (in parallel) to 
create  larger  bulk  loads  models,  without  loss  of  generality, 
while  preserving  both  nominal  as  well  as  the  sensitivity 
behavior of the load. 
  For instance, Fig. 4 represents the comparison between load 
currents produced from the fitted load model (shown in red dots 
using  quasi-steady  state  analysis)  and  those  from  true 
measurements (shown in black line) using data from a sensor at 
Lawrence  Berkeley  National  Laboratory  (LBNL)  [27]  for  a 
total of 12 days. For each time instance that is indicated by the 
blue line in Fig. 4, the BIG load model parameters are updated 
in real-time to capture the variation in load. Not only does the 
fitted BIG load capture the nominal measured data, but it also 
models the voltage-sensitive nature of the load currents, as is 
shown by the red circles in the Fig. 4.  
  Following the same approach, through online sampling  of 
measurement  data,  the  SUGAR-R  approach  can  also  update 
other  elements  in  the  network  such  as  generation  and  shunts

while also updating the branch and switch positions based on 
the device statuses. 

C.  Development of crank path  
In [8]-[10], extensive literature is presented on developing the 
crank path for grid restoration processes. The methods that exist 
today  develop  these  crank-paths  offline.  However,  during  a 
blackout,  equipment  may  be  damaged  and  network  topology 
may  be  altered  hence  alternating  the  original  crank-path  and 
making  the  resultant  off-line  analysis  inaccurate.  Moreover, 
real-time  operation  may  observe  load  distributions  that  are 
significantly  different  than  the  ones  that  were  originally 
evaluated and will result in a modification of the crank paths. 
Therefore, even though our proposed methodology starts with 
a  planned  crank-path,  its  following  step  updates  are  further 
based on the real-time decision analysis, available measurement 
data and network topology all captured within an optimization 
framework outlined in SUGAR-R. 

III.  OPTIMIZATION-BASED SUGAR-R FRAMEWORK 

A.  General Methodology 
In this section, we describe the internals and methodology of 
the  SUGAR-R  optimization  framework.  The  goal  of  the 
framework  is  to  validate  the  feasible  actuation  of  each  crank 
path step while ensuring that the voltage and frequency bounds 
are  enforced,  and  device  limits  met.  To  ensure  feasible 
actuation,  the  optimization  framework  minimally  adjusts  the 
generator active power set-points during ramp up from what is 
the  pre-defined  crank-path.  The 
initially  outlined  by 
mathematical formulation of the optimization problem that is 
solved  for  the  validity  of  each  crank  path  step  (𝐶𝑡 ∈
{𝐶1, 𝐶2, … , 𝐶𝑛}) is defined below:

represents the delta change of active generation (𝑔 ∈ 𝒢) that is

crank-path stage is operational, we also constrain the additional 
active  power  to  obey  ramping  constraints  given  by  (16). The 
ramping constraint ensures that the adjustments at a crank-path 
stage,  𝐶𝑡,  are  viable  with  respect  to  minimum  and  maximum 
ramping constraints, Δ𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑝 and Δ𝑃𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑝 respectively. 

To  solve  the  defined  optimization  sequentially  for  each 
crank-path stage, 𝐶𝑡, we formulate the problem using Primal-
Dual Interior Point (PDIP) algorithm [30] and apply a circuit-
theoretic  approach  to  solve  for  the  local  optima  [16].  It  is 
worthwhile  to  note  that  a  local  optimum  solution  to  the 
optimization problem is sufficient to meet the purposes of this 
grid  restoration  approach  i.e.  to  obtain  a  feasible  operating 
point. To obtain a solution, the circuit-based approach maps the 
first-order optimality conditions (KKT conditions) for the PDIP 
problem  into  a  set  of  equivalent  circuits  (see  [16]  for 
methodology) with following components:

where 𝜇 is the slack variable associated to the variable 𝑥 being 
bounded by 𝑥. In addition, 𝜖 is a small scalar (approximately 
1e-6) that ensures a continuous behavior. Following a general 
methodology  in  circuit  simulation  (also  see  [16]),  during 
Newton  Raphson  (NR),  each  iteration  will  update  the  dual 
variable and primal variable by: 

𝜇𝑘+1 = 𝜇𝑘 + 𝜏𝑢Δ𝜇 

𝑥𝑘+1 = 𝑥𝑘 + 𝜏𝑋Δ𝑥 

(27) 

(28) 

where Δ𝜇 and Δ𝑥 are the updates found after each NR, and 𝜏𝑢 
and  𝜏𝑋  are  their  respective  damping  factors.  𝜏𝑢  and  𝜏𝑋  are 
chosen  to  ensure  that  the  slack  dual  and  primal  variable  are 
within the limits defined by (29) and (30). 

𝜏𝑢 = min (1, −𝛾𝜇

where 𝛾𝑋, 𝛾𝜇 are constants (usually a value of 0.95) to restrict 
the variables 𝑥 and 𝜇 from oscillating around their limits. Each 
inequality  constraint  is  limited  separately,  thereby  improving 
convergence characteristics [16]. 

C.  Energizing Local Island 
The optimization framework is used online to generate feasible 
to 
crank-paths  while 
continuously update the models. At each crank-step, SUGAR-

local  measurements

R  robustly  adapts  a  pre-defined  crank-path  based  on  local 
measurements and device statuses, to find a feasible adjustment 
to the generator ramping. As a result, the local operators at each 
island can energize their respective island independently from 
the  rest  of  the  system  following  a  distributed  approach. 
Furthermore, operators can ensure in a timely manner, that the 
decisions made in the moment are feasible and optimal. 

D.  Synchronizing Multiple Islands 
After  operators  ensure  proper  re-energization  of  individual 
islands using SUGAR-R, they then are required to synchronize 
multiple  islands. In real operations, synchronizers ensure that 
the  complex voltage  magnitude,  phase  and  frequencies  at the 
interconnection  points  are  within  operational  bounds  to 
minimize  energy  flow  during  synchronization  [5].  In  this 
simulation  procedure,  we  strive  to  allow  zero  energy  flow 
between the interconnection by matching the voltages, angles 
and frequencies prior to synchronization.  

To ensure that the voltages and frequencies at the two islands 
are  matched,  the  synchronization  is  often  performed  near  a 
generating  station  where  the  operator  can  control  both  the 
voltage  and  frequency  by  adjusting  the  flow  of  reactive  and 
active  power  as  well  as  voltage  set  point  [5].  Of  course, 
operators  would  prefer  not  to  make  a  large  change  in  the 
existing frequency and voltage setpoints to reduce the chance 
of further system instability. Hence, to minimize the operator 
adjustment  during  synchronization,  SUGAR-R  aids 
in 
minimally adjusting the active and reactive power set points of 
participating generating stations (∀𝑔 ∈ 𝑠𝑦𝑛) to ensure proper 
synchronization of the islands (i.e. ensure complex voltages and 
frequency at interconnecting points are equal).

  Given 
synchronize, we can expect one island (island 1, without a loss 
of generality) to match the states at the interconnection point of 
the  other  island  (island  2).  This  entails  select  group  of 
participating  generators  (∀𝑔 ∈ 𝑠𝑦𝑛)  (usually  one  or  two)  in

synchronization. SUGAR-R is able to recommend changes for 
proper synchronization using the  approach outlined from (3)-
(16) along with some additional constraints and modification to 
the  objective  function.  Additional  equality  constraints  are 
required  to  match  the  states  of  islands  1and  2  at  the  point  of 
intersection as outlined by (31)-(33). These equations are part 
of the dispatch for island 1 and considers the states from island 
2  (𝑉𝑅2, 𝑉𝐼2 , Δ𝑓2)  are  constants.  This  enables  a  distributed 
synchronization  approach  with  island  2  sending  minimal 
information  to  island  1  (voltage,  angle  and  frequency  at  the 
point of intersection) through a cloud or local communication 
network,  as  shown  by  Fig. 1.  Smaller  amount  of  information 
being sent during a SCADA-absent blackout is vital as many 
forms of commination are unavailable.

Moreover,  during  synchronization  study,  majority  of  the 
generators  (except  those  participating  in  synchronization, 
(∀𝑔 ∈ 𝑠𝑦𝑛))  operate  in  constant  voltage  operation.  This 
requires  addition  of  newer  constraints

thereby  suggesting  a  need for  broader  change  in  grid  voltage

IV.  SUGAR-R FRAMEWORK 

Fig.  6  shows  the  SUGAR-R’s  algorithm  that  assists  in 
restoration  of  critical  collapsed  grid  sections  following  a 
blackout.  

Figure 6: Flowchart for SUGAR-R methodology for restoring grid. 
SUGAR-R  framework  maintains  the  localized  network 
model  of  the  grid  that  is  being  continuously  updated  in  real-
time through sampled data streams of local measurements and 
sensor  output.  Following  a  blackout,  the  framework  uses  the 
most recent network model for further analysis. The restoration 
analysis initiates with analyzing the first step of the crank path 
prior to its actual energization. If the analysis results determine 

6 

that  the  actuation of  crank path  violates  no device  limits  and 
results  in  a  feasible  system  state  with  no  network  constraint 
violations,  then  a  go-ahead  is  given  for  that  crank-path  to be 
actuated.  However,  if  the  simulation  results  show  that  no 
feasible  grid  state  exists  without  violating  device  limits  or 
tripping  protective  devices, 
then  corrective  actions  are 
suggested for the updating of the crank path step based on real-
power  infeasibility  information.  These  corrective  actions 
include  ramping  generators  real  power  and  changing  voltage 
setpoints. Once these changes have been realized into the crank 
path settings, the actual path is energized. Following which, the 
localized model is updated again with the measurements, and 
the procedure is repeated for the next crank path step. This is 
performed until all the steps of crank path are performed and 
the  localized  grid  is  restored.  In  case  where  the  multiple 
islanded sections are energized in parallel; as a final step, the 
tool assists in synchronizing the islands by recommending the 
control  setpoints  such  that  the  real  and  imaginary  voltages  at 
the  ends  of  the  synchronizing  branch  are  similar  with  same 
frequency. 

V.  RESULTS 

To  highlight  the  capability  of  the  proposed  SUGAR-R 
framework,  we  assist  in  restoration  of  a  collapsed  39-bus 
network  [12]  following  a  pre-defined  crank  path.  The  crank-
path  for  this  network  has  10  stages  (modified  from  [12])  as 
shown in Table 1. Each subsequent stage sequentially energizes 
generators  to  bring  up  parts  of  the  network,  with  a  reference 
generator at bus 30.

For the purposes of this experiment, it is assumed that SUGAR-
R  framework  has  access  to  real-time  online  network  model 
following  the  methodology  described  in  Section  II.    We  also 
set  points 
assume 
corresponding  to  the  individual  crank  path  step.  Given  these 
inputs, SUGAR-R evaluates the feasibility of each crank path 
step through its optimization-based framework (see Sections III 
and  IV)  and  recommends  changes  to  ramping  generators  set-
points  when  necessary.  After  energizing  the  localized  grid 
sections, SUGAR-R assists in synchronization of two islanded 
networks. To meet the goals, SUGAR-R uses an accurate and 
robust 
to 
simulate  the  steady-state  of  each  crank-path,  the  efficacy  of 
which  will  be  demonstrated  in  comparison  to  other  standard 
steady-state methodologies.

it is seen that the obtained solution is impractical for assisting 
in  grid  blackstart  as  the  slack  generator  is  consuming  power 
(negative  power  indicated  in  red  in  Table  2),  well  below  its 
active  power  minimum  of  0  MW  in  many  of  the  crank  path 
steps. By not simulating the change in frequency due to over-
generation,  the  slack  generator  is  required  to  consume  active 
power rather than inject. Therefore, this approach is unlikely to 
assist in robust energization of the grid as it is not able to mimic 
the reality. Moreover, this platform does not provide awareness 
about  network  feasibility  or  the  frequency  state  and  hence  is 
unlikely to prevent actuation of protective devices due to out of 
bound state variables.

B.  Restoration through Governor Power Flow SUGAR 
Governor power flow platform (including some industry tools) 
can  capture  frequency  deviation  and  therefore  can  avoid 
unrealistic  system  state  due  to  slack  bus  model  by  modeling 
implicit primary frequency control within the framework [19]. 
Table 3 documents the maximum and minimum voltage values 
and the frequency deviation from nominal for each crank path 
flow-based 
step.  Although,  SUGAR  governor  power 
framework  provides  realistic  situational  awareness,  in  the 
results  we  still  observe  that  the  frequency  state  is  out  of 
allowable bounds of +/- 1.2 Hz and hence can result in actuation 
of  under/over  frequency  load  shedding.  Specifically,  in  the 
crank path stages 1, 2, 5 and 9, the large frequency deviation is 
a cause for concern.

This  is  because  of  primary  droop  control  due  to  which,  the 
network  settles  to  a  steady  state  with  a  positive  frequency 
change, indicating excess power generation in the system. This 
may  result  in  likely  actuation  of  protective  device  tripping 
during energization and therefore may result in system collapse. 
Improved  situational  awareness  in  this  framework  suggests  a 
likely  issue  in  the  crank  path;  however,  it  does  not  provide 
feedback  on  how  best  to  rectify  this  over  frequency  problem 
while ensuring that the other system states are bounded, and the 
feasibility  of  the  state  is  maintained.  Therefore,  next  we 
demonstrate system restoration through an optimization-based 
SUGAR-R framework. 

C.  Restoration through Optimization-Based SUGAR-R 
Framework. 
To ensure proper steady state values for each crank path stage 
while re-energizing the island, SUGAR-R introduces frequency 
and  voltage  bounds,  as  well  as  a  measure  of  active  power 
infeasibility, Δ𝑃𝐺 into the formulation. The limits on frequency 
and voltages used in this experiment are:

Using the optimization framework described in section II, the

at  each  stage  of  the  crank  path.  The  necessary  correction  to 
generator  active  power  setpoints  to  ensure  such  operation  is 
reflected by Δ𝑃𝐺 in Table 4.

As seen in stages 1, 2, 5 and 7 (also seen in Fig. 7), the generator 
active powers are re-adjusted to control the frequency such that 
the ramping constraints are not violated. Similarly, the tool also 
recommends the optimal voltage set-points for the generators 
during each crank-path step actuation.

D.  Synchronizing Islands 
In  the  final  part  of  this  experiment,  we  consider  two  39-bus 
islanded  networks  that  have  been  fully  restored  and  require 
synchronization.  To  simulate  proper  synchronization  at  the 
interconnection  nodes  between  bus  30  of  island  1  (with  a 
loading  factor  of  0.95)  and  bus  28  of  island  2  (with  loading 
factor of 1.0), we introduce three equality constraints given by 
(31)-(33) to result in a solution with identical complex voltages 
and frequency of: 

|𝑉30

I1|= |𝑉28

I2| = 1.063 pu

I2 = 5.34 degrees

I1 are the voltage magnitude and angle of bus 
where 𝑉30
I2 are the voltage magnitude and 
30 on island 1, and 𝑉28
angle  of  bus  28  of  island  2.  In  this  experiment,  island  1  is 
adjusting the voltage and frequency at the interconnection point 
to match that of island 2.Two generators on island 1 (on bus 30 
and bus 38 on island 1) were actively participating in aiding the 
synchronizing of two networks by adjusting their set points to 
ensure identical states on island 2 whereas other generators in 
island  1  operated  in  fixed-voltage  mode.  Recommended  real 
and reactive power set-points for the participating generators to 
achieve similar complex voltages at the interconnection points 
are given below in Table 5.

VI.  CONCLUSION 

In this paper, we developed a framework that assists in grid 
restoration  under  the  loss  of  or  during  unavailable  SCADA 
system. Unlike centralized grid restoration that is dependent on 
central  SCADA  and  EMS,  this  approach  works  to  energize 
critical  components  of  the  localized  grid  via  maintaining  an 
online network model that is continuously updated using real-
time  measurements.  To  assist  in  restoration,  the  framework 
simulates the online network model to ensure that each  crank 
path step results in a feasible grid state and is actuated such that 
the  voltage  and  frequency  remain  within  bounds.  To  achieve 
this  goal,  the  framework  recommends  adjustments  to  the 
generator control setpoints. After energizing individual islands, 
the  framework  assists  in  synchronization  of  islands  through 
recommending  generator  setpoints  that  result  in  identical 
complex voltages and frequency at the interconnection points.
