Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a salient communication environment to facilitate the coordinated charging of electric 
vehicle (EV) load. However, as IoT is connected with the public network, the coordinated charging system is in a low-level cyber security 
and greatly vulnerable to malicious attacks.  This paper investigates the malicious mode attack (MMA), which is a new cyber-attack 
pattern  that  simultaneously  attacks  massive  EV  charging  piles  to  generate  continuous  sinusoidal  power  disturbance  with  the  same 
frequency as the poorly-damped wide-area electromechanical mode. Thereby, high amplitude forced oscillations could be stimulated by 
MMA, which seriously threats the power system stability. First, the potential threat of MMA is clarified by investigating the vulnerability 
of the IoT-based coordinated charging load control system, and an MMA process like Mirai is pointed out as an example.  And then, 
based on the attack process, an MMA model is established for impact analysis where expressions of the mean and stochastic responses 
of the MMA forced oscillation are derived to discover main impact factors. Further, to mitigate the impact of MMA, a defense strategy 
based on multi-index information active disturbance rejection control is proposed to improve the stability and anti-disturbance ability 
of  the  power  system,  which  considers  the  impact  factors  of  both  mode  damping  and  disturbance  compensation.  Simulations  are 
conducted to verify the existence and characteristics of MMA threats, and the efficiency of the proposed defense strategy is also validated.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

T 

he increasing charging demand of the electric vehicle (EV) 
has  put  tremendous  pressures  on  the  power  supply. 
Accordingly,  coordinated  charging  strategies  based  on 
Internet of things (IoT) technology is developing rapidly, e.g., 
the smart charging (V1G) and the vehicle-to-grid (V2G), which 
efficiently exploits the flexibility and controllability of the EV.  
The charging network fitted out with the Internet connection 
and the satellite navigation can coordinately control the EV load. 
Moreover, the transportation network is connected closer to the 
power  grid  with  the  widespread  of  the  IoT  in  EV,  charging 
network, smart grid, etc. Now the EV can obtain more flexible, 
convenient, and friendly electric power through the intelligent 
integrated controller of industrial internet of things (IIoT). Thus, 
the  coordinated  charging  network  serves  as  a  key  part  of  the 
smart grid, forming a complex large system fused with power, 
information and the communication network. 

In  the  sophisticated  information-sharing  IIoT,  the  security 
issue  poses  various  challenges  to  the  safe  operation  of  the 
power infrastructure. In 2010, Iran’s industrial infrastructure is 
hit  by  Stuxnet  worm  via  the  supervisory  control  and  data 
acquisition  (SCADA)  system  [1].  In  2015,  hours  of  Ukraine 
blackouts  were  caused  by  cyber-attacks  on  three  region’s 
distribution  network  company  [2].  The  IOT  virus  has  broken 
out since 2016, e.g., Mirai, Haijime, Persirai, BrickerBot, Okiru, 
et  cetera.  They  exploit  vulnerabilities  and  produce  multiple 
cyber-attack ways such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attack, malicious data [4], malicious software [5], and password 
intrusion [6]. The common  feature is that  malicious attackers 

control industrial equipment to break the power energy balance 
through cyber-attacks, causing the destruction of power system 
stability. Therefore, to reduce damage, researchers should race 
against  attackers  to  find  potential  cyber-attack  vulnerabilities 
and provide defense strategies in advance. 

A large-scale cyber-attack directly against power-consuming 
devices,  compared  with  the  traditional  cyber-attack  against 
transmission  and  distribution  devices,  is  more  critical  and 
harder to defend due to the diversity and dispersion of power-
consuming. Recently, EVs are aggregated to participate in peak 
cut  [7],  frequency  regulation  [8]  and  power  system  dynamic 
response [9] through coordinated charging networks. However, 
the aggregated EVs are also at risk of malicious control. [10] 
summarized  typical  cyber-attacks  via  grid-tied  converters. 
Moreover,  EVs  can  also  be  used  as  a  bridge  or  platform  to 
launch malicious programs [11]. Thus, it is necessary to protect 
the  energy-Internet-based  V2G  communication  from  cyber-
attacks  [12].  However,  it  is  difficult  for  the  cyber  system  to 
propose a unified secure mechanism that could defend against 
all cyber-attacks. Hence, besides improving cyber security, the 
physical power grid should also enhance its survivability under 
cyber-attacks. 

Motivated by above issues, this paper investigates malicious 
mode attack (MMA), a new cyber-attack pattern, which utilizes 
the coordinated charging load control system (CCLCS) as the 
tool to send the malicious code of the forced oscillation control 
command.  It  can  create  a  high-amplitude  forced  oscillation 
according to the weakly damped wide-area electromechanical 
mode, thereby destroying the stability of the system. Thus, the 
MMA  model  is  established,  followed  by  analysis  on  the 

 
 
 
 
characteristics  of  MMA.  Moreover,  it  is  difficult  to  actively 
eliminate  this  risk  through  the  existing  cyber  technology  of 
defense  or  the  physical  technology  of  forced  oscillation 
positioning. Therefore, this paper provides a multi-information 
active distribution rejection control (MIADRC) method for the 
physical smart grid to enhance its robustness, thereby passively 
suppressing the risk of forced oscillation.  

Main  contributions  of  this  paper  are  (1)  the  MMA  threat 
through the coordinated charging is discovered and investigated, 
(2)  the  model  of  MMA  via  the  coordinated  charging  is 
through 
established  and  characteristics  are  concluded 
theoretically analysis, (3) and an MIADRC strategy is provided 
to enhance the defense capability against MMA.  

This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the 
CCLCS  structure  and  reveals  the  MMA  threat.  Section  III 
introduces 
the  model  of  MMA  and  analyzes  MMA 
characteristics.  Section  IV  provides  the  MIADRC  defense 
strategy. Section V validates the MMA threat, its characteristics, 
and the effectiveness of the proposed defense strategy, followed 
by conclusions given in Section VI. 

II. COORDINATED CHARGING LOAD CONTROL SYSTEMS AND 
MALICIOUS MODE ATTACKS  

The  coordinated  charging  guides  the  charging  behavior  of 
EVs  to  follow  the  economic  dispatch  command  via  CCLCS 
[13].  Thus,  this  section  will  provide  a  bird’s  eye  view  of 
CCLCS  and  investigate  its  vulnerability  to  the  MMA  threat, 
followed  by  the  definition,  attack  process  and  malicious 
command of MMA to further demonstrate the MMA threat. 

A. Coordinated Charging Load Control System 

CCLCS  consists  of 

three  parts:  power  conversion, 
communication network, and energy management. By making 
the  EV  charging  load  act  as  the  demand  response  resource, 
CCLCS  downward  controls  the  charging  load  of  EVs,  and 
upward  participates  in  the  coordinated  schedule  of  “source-
grid-load”. A typical CCLCS is shown in Fig. 1. 

2 

(BMS). By these devices and systems, the controlled electrical 
power  is  transmitted  to  the  charging  pile  via  generator, 
transmission line, distribution network, and transformer under 
the joint control of CCLCS and EMS. 

For the control process of CCLCS, the charging control cloud 
develops  a  coordinated  charging  power  control  strategy  that 
considers  both  the  dispatch  commands  from  the  dispatch 
control  center  and  the  customer  demands  from  the  customer 
service cloud, and passes it to the energy controller. Then the 
energy  controller  optimizes  the  control  strategy  based  on  the 
distribution network information and the  power constraints of 
transformers, and sends it to the energy router. Next, the energy 
router combines the received control command with the state-
of-charge (SOC) given by BMS to optimize the final order. This 
order will finally be executed by the charging pile in the power 
exchanging process with the EVs. 

To facilitate the above control process, first, the information 
and communication technology (ICT) technique is adopted by 
CCLCS to send and received information, including Bluetooth, 
CAN,  PLC,  satellite  communication,  mobile  communication, 
etc. Then, with the contribution of ICT, components of the IoT 
operating  system  (OS),  including  energy  controller,  energy 
router and coordinated charging piles, can be connected for the 
implementation of communication and control functions, where 
main communication modes are illustrated in Table I. Besides, 
owing to GPS or NTP, all devices in Fig. 1 can achieve time 
synchronization in a high accuracy level.

However,  a  huge  MMA  threat  is  buried.  Traditionally,  the 
the 
power  system  adopts 
communicate  channel  to  keep  a  high-level  communication 
security,  which 
the  public 
communication.  However,  as  shown  in  Table  I,  CCLCS 
exchanges  data  with  public  consumers  through  the  public 
communication network, CCLCS is exposed to cyber attackers 
in  the  public  communication  network.  For  instance,  since 
connected to user apps from public networks, the energy router 
and customer service cloud are at high risks of being attacked. 
Unfortunately,  it  is  very  difficult  for  the  power  supplier  to 
ensure the security of all public network information. Finally, 
as terminals of CCLCS, massive charging piles are easy to be 
manipulated  to  launch  MMA  by  cyber-attackers,  seriously 
threating power system stability. 

B. Malicious Mode Attacks 

In this paper, MMA is defined as a cyber-attack that sends 
Trojan  horse  viruses  containing  a  malicious  load  control 

Fig. 1.  A typical CCLCS. 

As  is  shown  in  Fig.  1,  main  devices  of  CCLCS  include 
coordinated  charging  pile,  user  applications  (Apps),  energy 
router, energy controller, charging control cloud, and customer 
service  cloud.  Main  systems  contained  in  CCLCS  are  energy 
management  system  (EMS),  distribution  automation  system, 
global position system (GPS), IoT, battery management system 

 
 
 
command  which  controls  the  behavior  of  large-scale  EV 
charging loads to simultaneously act as a continuous sinusoidal 
power  disturbance  with  the  same  frequency  as  the  weakly 
damped inter-area electromechanical oscillation mode.  

Once the vulnerability in public network is found, the attack 
process  of  MMA  is  not  a  big  problem  for  hackers.  A  junior 
attacker can penetrate the customer service cloud through  the 
user APP, and then invade the charging control cloud system to 
send  Trojans  through  the  firewall  vulnerabilities.  Moreover, 
professional  hackers  may  hack  the  charging  control  system 
directly to send Trojans or the malicious coordinated charging 
control commands.  

The  MMA  attacker  can  first  penetrate  into  CCLCS,  then 
infect  devices  in  CCLCS,  and  finally  attack  charging  piles 
simultaneously. To show this attack process clearly, a typical 
MMA like Mirai is taken as an example and illustrated in Fig. 
2. And to save space, attack steps of Fig. 2 are summarized and 
given  in  Algorithm  1.  The  penetration,  infection,  and  attack 
steps of MMA correspond to blue, red, and yellow lines in Fig.2, 
respectively, and also correspond to the first, second, and third 
parts of Algorithm 1, respectively.

1  The  attacker  runs  the  loader  program  to  detect  a  weak-password 

energy router, and then logs in. 

2  The  penetrated  energy  router  executes  the  MMA  program  and 

randomly performs Telnet blasting on the public IP. 

3  More  usernames  and  passwords  of  devices  are  blasted  through  the 

configuration sever. 

4  The loader program continues to penetrate other vulnerable devices. 

5 

The infected devices download the MMA Trojan program from the 
file server after upgrading the remote software. 

6  The attacker obtains the weakly-damped mode from FNET and send 
the  malicious  load  control  command to  the control  server.  And the  
control server sends attack instruments to infected devices. 

7  The  malicious  load  control  commands  are  triggered  by  the  MMA 
Trojans and executed simultaneously at a unified GPS clock via the 
charging piles. 

Through the above attack process, CCLCS commands can be 
maliciously  manipulated  by  MMA,  which  means  the  normal 
power  control  command  of  the  ith  charging  pile 
 can  be 
intercepted and tampered with. A continuous power disturbance 
 so 
command is generated by MMA Trojans and added to 

that the final power control command Pci is 

3 

(1) 

where I% is the ratio of the cosine disturbance peak value to the 
normal 
, and ω is the frequency of this disturbance which 
can  be  identified  by  FNET  or  μPMU  from  an  ordinary 
household  electrical  outlet.  The  above  parameters  of  the 
malicious load control command can be sent to the Trojan in 5 
minutes before the attack, and then numerous EVs will launch 
the attack simultaneously using the unified GPS clock.  

Finally, under the malicious manipulation of MMA, power 
fluctuations of numerous EV loads will cause a high-amplitude 
forced  oscillation.  Hence,  the  MMA  threat  to  power  system 
stability is formed. 

III.  MMA MODEL FOR CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS 
Conducting  theoretical  analysis  to  determine key  factors  is 
the  basis  for  eliminating  the  MMA  threat.  In  this  section,  a 
mathematical model is first built to represent the power system 
under  MMA.  And  then,  theoretical  analysis  is  conducted  to 
investigate  characteristics  of  stimulated  forced  oscillation  to 
MMA and propose key points of MMA defense. 

A. Mathematical Model for Power System under MMA 

The charging pile converter includes a VIENNA rectifier for 
ac-dc  conversion  and  a  full  bridge  LLC  series  resonant 
converter for the dc-dc conversion [14]. As this paper focuses 
time  scale,  an 
the  electromechanical 
on  dynamics  of 
electromechanical dynamic model of a normal charging pile is 
built (Fig. 3) which includes phase locked loop (PLL), power 
control, simplified current control [15], and Park transformation 
with fast dynamics of the DC circuit ignored. It is expressed as 

 and 

(2) 

where xPLL and θPLL are state variables of PLL, id and iq are d-
axis  and  q-axis  currents  injected  into  the  transmission  grid,  
, Pref and Qref 
are commands for active and reactive power control,  three PI 
controls are adopted for PLL and the power control, and τ1 and 
τ2 are the time delay introduced by the inner current control loop.

with  n  charging  piles,  we  will  obtain  the  aggregated  active 
power command Pa0 by summing

given in (1), 
 is tampered with to Pci. Thus, Pa0 will become 
Pa which can be computed by  

(3) 

where 

 is the mean of 

. 

In (7), the first item is a free oscillation that can be ignored 
when  the  initial  state  is  zero,  and  the  third  item  can  also  be 
omitted since D is zero. Therefore, the mean response of yk (the 
kth element of y(t)) to u(t) is in a simple form expressed as 

4 

where I% and ω are constant and determined before MMA as 
explained  below  (1),  and 
.  Because  the 
charging  demand  and  charging  behavior  of  each  EV  are 
stochastic, Pc0i(t) and the aggregated value Pa0(t) are stochastic. 
However, the forced oscillation stimulated by MMA only lasts 
tens of seconds, and
 remains almost constant during this 
can  be  considered  as  a  stationary 
period.  Hence, 
 approximately  obeys  normal 
stochastic  process 
distribution [16]. 

,  and 

Thus,  considering  MMA,  (2)  can  model  both  single  and 
aggregated massive charging piles by assigning different active 
commands. Once, MMA is launched, for a single charging pile, 
Pref=Pci(t), and for aggregated charging piles, Pref=Pa(t).  

Then, the aggregated charging pile model is added into the 
power  system  model  to  build  the  mathematical  model  of  the 
whole power system for further theoretical analysis on MMA, 
which can be expressed as

At this point, formulas for the mean and standard deviation 
of the simulated forced oscillation have been derived. Based on 
(8-15),  the  following  five  laws  are  concluded  to  describe  the 
characteristics of the simulated forced oscillation. 
Law 1: The MMA response consists of the mean response (8) 
and  the  stochastic  response  (11).  The  mean  response  is  very 
large under the influence of the frequency resonance. And the 
stochastic response is small under the excitation of wideband 
random MMA signals. 
Law 2: The mean response is composed of the free oscillation 
and the resonance oscillation whose frequency is the same  as 
that of the disturbance. The weaker the inherent mode damping 
ratio, the greater the oscillation amplitude. 
Law 3: The closer the frequency of the MMA attack signal is to 
the inherent mode, the greater the forced oscillation amplitude, 
and the closer of the mode shape.  
Law 4: The beat frequency oscillation could be observed when 
the frequency of the MMA attack signal is different from the 
frequency of the free oscillation. 
Law 5: The variance of the stochastic response mainly includes 
the  DC  component,  and  the  component  whose  frequency  is 
twice the MMA attack signal. 

It can be inferred from above laws that the simulated forced 
oscillation  is  different  from  free  oscillation,  which  is  easy  to 
recognize  [17].  For  the  suppression  of  the  stimulated  forced 
oscillation by MMA, measures can be taken from two aspects: 
the  adjustment  of  the  electromechanical  mode  and  the 
suppression  of  disturbance  source.  On  the  one  hand,  we  can 
increase the damping of the power system, or quickly control 
the natural frequency of the power system away from the MMA 
frequency, such as power system stabilizer. On the other hand, 
we can reduce the intensity of the disturbance source through 
isolating  charging  piles  attacked  by  MMA  or  actively 
compensating the MMA disturbance. 

IV.  THE DEFENSE STRATEGY AGAINST MMA 

Designing  a  suitable  controller  to  defend  against  MMA  is 
necessary,  however,  it  is  a  tricky  problem.  As  an  open 
ecosystem  for  the  plug-in  devices,  CCLCS  contains  many 
system  vulnerabilities.  Moreover,  different  IoT  devices  have 
different  standard  protocols  and  system  programs.  And  the 
same equipment produced by different manufacturers are also 
different,  e.g.,  user  App,  communication  facility,  vehicle 
system, cloud system, etc. Thus, it is hard for the power system 
to design a dedicated defense grogram for each device. And it 
is  also  difficult  for  the  cyber  system  to  completely  avoid  all 

5 

cyber-attacks,  because  a  perfect  cyber  defense  system  for  all 
attacks  has  not  yet  been  proposed.  In  addition,  isolating  the 
charging piles attacked by MMA from the power system may 
be a solution. However, even if the attacked charging substation 
is detected by the forced oscillation analysis method, it is still 
hard to locate the exact charging pile quickly and accurately. 
Hence, the entire charging station has to be isolated, which will 
cause  a  large  number  of  normal  charging  piles  to  be  out  of 
service. This is not an economical solution. 

Based on the conclusion of part B in Section III, this section 
aims to propose a defense approach that passively strengthens 
the  damping  of  the  attacked  electromechanical  mode  and 
actively compensates MMA disturbance to promote appropriate 
defensive reactions.  

Usually,  MMA is unexpected, setting compensation  values 
for power disturbances injected by MMA is hard to accomplish 
in  advance.  Based  on  this  consideration,  active  disturbance 
rejection  control  is  very  promising  since  it  can  provide 
compensation  in  real  time  for  injected  disturbance  [18]. 
However,  as  the  relative  order  of  control  is  unable  to 
determined,  traditional  active  disturbance  rejection  control  is 
difficult to directly apply to the power system. And the stability 
of  ADRC  cannot  be  guaranteed.  Hence,  there  is  a  risk  of 
instability when using this method. 

To deal with the above problem, this section proposes a new 
multi-index  information  active  disturbance  rejection  control 
(MIADRC) for the defense of MMA, and also gives the stability 
analysis of MIADRC. 

A. Multi-index  Information  Active  Disturbance  Rejection 
Control (MIADRC) 

Assume that there are m machines in the power system. And 
each machine includes a third-order generator model and a first-
order  static  exciter  model  [19].  Then,  one  can  build  the 
following state space expressions [19] for the m machines  

 (16) 

where 

. 

Stimulated  by  MMA,  forced  oscillations  of  the  attacked 
electromechanical mode will appear among m generators. The 
proposed MIADRC is a decentralized strategy, which provides 
additional  control  signals  to  m  exciters  and  suppresses  the 
MMA forced oscillation in every generator.  

The  key  to  construct  the  MIADRC  defense  strategy  is  to 
design  a  suitable  input  signal.  We  propose  a  multi-index 
information form for the input  y(t) of MIADRC based on the 
idea of multi-index nonlinear coordinated control [20], which 
can be expressed as

To  calculate  the  relative  order  of  (17),  we  employ  the 
differential geometric linearization method. By combining (16) 
and  (17),  we  construct  an  m-input  m-output  nonlinear  m-
machine power system expressed as

MIADRC  on  the  ith  generator  is  shown  in  Fig.  4  where  (a) 
provides the structure of MIADRC and (b) corresponds to the 
control flow chart.  An online identification program is run to 
detect MMA. Once MMA is detected, the switch S1 in Fig. 4 
(a)  is  closed  immediately,  which  directly  put  MIADRC  into 
operation.  Then,  the  output  of  MIADRC  compensates  the 
disturbance  and  suppresses  the  forced  oscillation  brought  by 
MMA.  Finally,  when  MMA  stops,  S1  is  open  to  isolate 
MIADRC from the power system.

From (19), it can be concluded that the relative order from

constructed based on (19) and second-order active disturbance 
rejection  control.  It  consists  of  multi-index  information  input

V. CASE SIMULATION AND STUDY 

In this section, a test platform was built to verify the MMA 
threat  and  verify  the  mathematical  model  for  MMA  analysis. 
And  characteristics of MMA are also demonstrated, followed 
by the validation of the effectiveness of the proposed MIADRC 
defense strategy. 

A. Verify the MMA Threat and the Model for MMA Analysis 

A hardware test platform, as shown in Fig.6, is established to 
verify the MMA threat and the mathematical model for MMA 
analysis.  To  build  this  platform,  we  connected  a  coordinated 
charging pile to a power source that simulates the infinite bus, 
used Raspberry Pi with FreeRTOS system installed to imitate 
an energy router, and adopted AliBaba Cloud server to imitate 
the  charging  cloud  which  is  connected  to  the  Raspberry  Pi 
(energy router) using the MQTT protocol. We assumed that the 
charging control cloud  can be infected by  the  MMA Trojans, 
which  was  simulated  by  presetting  the  MMA  malicious 
program.  This  program  was designed  to downloaded  into  the 
Raspberry  Pi  via  the  cloud  service,  and  then  manipulate  the 
output power of the charging pile. We are also equipped with a 
DL850EV oscillography, which can measure AC voltage  and 
output power of the charging pile during the period of MMA. 

Based on this test platform, we first verified the correctness 
of  the  proposed  charging  pile  model  for  MMA  analysis.  As 
MMA attacks the active power command of the charging pile, 
the  dynamic  response  to  the  change  of  Pref  is  vital  in 
constructing the model for MMA analysis. Thus, we perturbed 
the power command value in this test platform, and compared 
the measured dynamic response with the numerical simulation 
results of the proposed mathematical model.

The active power command of the charging pile in Fig. 6 was 
increased from 0.2 to 0.5 p.u, and the corresponding dynamic 
responses measured by the oscillography is shown as the orange 
line in Fig. 7. Meanwhile, by using the proposed model in Fig. 
3  to  model  the  charging  pile,  the  time  domain  numerical 
simulation  program  also  calculated  the  dynamic  response  of 
this disturbance, which is represented by the blue line in Fig. 7.

Moreover,  the  modal  information  in  the  measured  and

Prony  analysis.  And  the  modal  information  of  the  simulated 
blue  line  is  computed  by  the  modal  analysis  program  which 
adopts the linearized form of the proposed charging pile model 
(2). All obtained results are given in Table II. It shows that the 
error is lower than 1%. Therefore, the proposed charging pile 
model  can  reflect  electromechanical-scale  modal  information 
with high accuracy.

discussed by using IEEE 4-machine 2-area system [21] shown 
in  Fig.  11.  A  large  EV  charging  load  is  added  at  Bus  7  and 
adopts the charging pile model described by (2). 

Fig. 11.  The IEEE 4-machine 2-area test system with large-scaled EV load. 

The  impact of  the  power  value  of  the  EV  charging  load  is 
analyzed. Increasing the charging load from 0.5 to 8 p.u., the 
mode trajectory of the wide-area oscillation mode related to (G1, 
G2) vs. (G3, G4) is computed and given in Fig. 12, where the 
corresponding  damping  and  frequency  are  also  calculated.  It 
shows that the damp and the frequency first rise then fall. The 
varying range of damping ratio is from 0.074 to 0.022, and the 
varying range of frequency is from 0.46 to 0.62 Hz. Thus, the 
charging  load has  a great  impact  on  the  damping  ratio  of the 
wide-area oscillation mode. 

In addition, the trajectory of the wide-area oscillation mode 
is also studied under different values of EV load within a day. 
A typical 24-hour coordinated charging load data was applied 
to  the  EV  load  in  this  test  system  (Fig.  11).  The  adopted 
charging  load  data  and  the  corresponding  damping  and 
frequency of  the  wide-area  oscillation  mode  are  illustrated  in 
Fig.  13.  It  shows  that  damping  ratio  is  very  low  during 
21:00~3:00 at night, which corresponds to the period near the 
peak value of EV charging load. This phenomenon is consistent 
with the varying trend of damping in the region of heavy EV 
load  in  Fig.  12.  Therefore,  the  damping  of  the  wide-area 
oscillation mode in this test system is weak during the period of 
heavy EV load. 

PLL in Fig. 3. The obtained mode trajectories are shown in Fig. 
9. It can be seen from Fig. 10 that kp3 mainly affects the real part 
of this mode, and the mode decay rate increases as kp3 increases. 
As for ki3, it mainly affects the imaginary part of this mode, and, 
the mode frequency increases as ki3 increases. Hence, for a large 
number  of  charging  piles,  the  equivalent  electromechanical 
model can be established by selecting appropriate kp3 and ki3. In 
the analyses on MMA, certain fixed parameters kp3 and ki3 can 
be assumed. And when the charging pile model is applied to a 
specific  MMA  instance,  the  corresponding  parameter  values 
can be determined based on the actual measurement data. 

Fig. 8.  The participation factor of charging pile for electromechanical mode. 

Fig. 9.  Mode trajectories when kp3 and ki3 increase. 

Next, we validated the MMA threat. As is shown in Table II, 
there is a 1.37Hz mode in the electrochemical time scale. Hence, 
 of  the  MMA  attack  command  (1)  to 
we  set  the  frequency 
1.37Hz. Attacked by (1), the corresponding dynamic responses 
of active power of the charging pile were both measured in the 
test platform (Fig. 6) and simulated by the numerical simulation 
program, which generated the results in Fig. 10. It can be seen 
that the simulated dynamic response indicated by the blue line 
is quite close to the measured dynamic response indicated by 
the  orange  line.  Moreover,  both  the  measured  and  simulated 
results of the active power of the charging pile quickly track the 
MMA reference signal and oscillate. Hence, it is demonstrated 
that  MMA  can  quickly  cause  obvious  forced  oscillation. 
Considering that in a bulk power system the forced oscillation 
usually  affects  two  interconnected  regional  power  grids, 
therefore,  MMA  is  a  great  threat  for  the  stability  of  the  bulk 
power system.

charging load, and the corresponding damping and frequency.

Based on the tests above, heavy EV load greatly reduces the 
damping of the wide-area oscillation mode in this test system. 
As  one  can  always  detect  a  certain  period  near  the  charging 
peak of large-scaled EV load, setting the launch time for MMA 
is  not  a  difficult  task.  Hence,  this  test  system  is  greatly 
threatened by MMA. And in the following contents, this system 
is  adopted  to  test  the  characteristics  of  the  stimulated  forced 
oscillation by MMA. 

Summarizing Section III.B, we can draw the conclusion that 
the magnitude of the forced oscillation under MMA is affected 
by  three  factors:  disturbance  intensity,  system  damping  and 
frequency deviation. These factors will be analyzed below. 

Fig. 14.  Forced oscillations under different ratio I%. 

Fig. 15.  Forced oscillations under different system damping conditions.

Firstly, the factor of  disturbance intensity  is adopted in the 
characteristic  test.  Since  disturbance  intensity  is  mainly 
affected by the amplitude of the MMA disturbance determined 
by  disturbance  ratio  I%  as  defined  in  (1),  simulations  under 
different values of I% are conducted and shown in Fig. 14. It 
reveals that the oscillation amplitude raises as I% increases. As 
the  mean  response  dominates  the  amplitude  of  the  forced 
oscillation.  And  according  to  (7),  the  mean  response  is 
positively  correlated  with  I%.  Thus,  this  phenomenon  that 
oscillation  amplitude  increases  with  I%  is  reasonable  and  in 
accordance with Law 1.  

Next, the characteristic test mainly focuses on the factor of 
system damping. As demonstrated in Fig. 13, the damping ratio 
is greatly influenced by the EV load. Two scenarios of base EV 
load  and  heavy  EV  load  are  considered.  The  corresponding 
modal information is computed and listed in TABLE III, where 
the  damping  is  sufficient  under  the  base-load  case  and  very 
weak  under  the  heavy-load  case.  Simulations  under  both 
scenarios are conducted and presented in Fig. 15. It shows that 
the  forced  oscillation  power  amplitude  in  the  heavy-load 
operation  is  significantly  higher  than  that  in  the  base-load 
operation, which infers that under MMA less damped  system

Further, the influence of the frequency is tested. The heavy-
load  case  in  TABLE  III  is  adopted  and  different  signal 
frequencies  0.57,  0.62  and  0.65  Hz  are  set  for  MMA.  The 
corresponding responses of output power of four generators are 
given in Fig. 16, where the relevant mode shapes are also given. 
The  0.62  Hz  MMA  causes  a  forced  oscillation  with  larger 
amplitude than that caused by 0.65 and 0.57 Hz. And the modal 
shape related to 0.62 Hz is closer to the inherent mode (dotted 
line),  which  is  consistent  to  Law  3.  Moreover,  the  beat 
frequency oscillations only appear in 0.65 and 0.57 Hz cases, 
which is in accord with Law 4.

17(a) and (b)) and calculated results (Fig. 17 (c) and (d)). As is 
shown, due to the weaken resonance caused by the excitation of 
the  wideband  random  signal,  the  impact  of  the  random 
disturbance is very small. Moreover, as is shown, the computed 
statistical variance (Fig. 17 (d)) based on the pseudo excitation 
method can well describe the main characteristics of the actual 
statistical variance (Fig. 17 (b)). Thus, the statistical variance 
contains the DC and the double frequency components, which 
is consistent with Law 5. 

C. Performance of the MIADRC Strategy against MMA 

In this section, the performance of MIADRC against MMA 
is  tested.  Both  the  base-load  and  heavy-load  conditions 
specified in TABLE III are considered in the 2-area 4-machine 
test system in Fig. 11. MMA is set to be launched at 1.0 s and 
sustained from 1.0 to 20.0 s. Main parameters for the MIADRC 
defense strategy are given below (18) and (20) with bi=4600.  

First,  we  assume  that  MMA  is  quickly  detected  so  that 
MIADRC is put into operation at 1.0 s. Then the corresponding 
power responses generator under base and heavy load cases are 
simulated and shown in Fig. 18 and Fig. 19, respectively. For 
comparison,  the  defense  performance  of  wide-area  power 
system stabilizer (WAPSS) is also computed and given in Fig. 
18  and  Fig.  19,  respectively.  Also,  the  dynamic  responses 

without defense are also demonstrated in Fig. 18 and Fig. 19, 
respectively.  It  is  shown  that  compared  with  the  no-defense 
condition,  the  MIADRC  and  WAPSS  can  both  suppress  the 
forced  oscillations.  However,  the  MIADRC  strategy  takes  an 
obvious  advantage  in  the  suppression  for  the  above  extreme 
operating conditions. Hence, the MIADRC strategy has a good 
adaptability  to  different  operating  conditions,  and  MIADRC 
improves  the  system  damping  and  actively  eliminates  the 
persistent forced oscillation generated by MMA. 

Then,  a  time  delay  representing  the  detection  time  is 
considered  to  test  the  effectiveness  of  the  detailed  response 
process (Fig. 4) of the MIADRC strategy. In this test scenario, 
we assume the MMA detection takes 4 s, and then MIADRC 
can  be  put  into  operation  within  0.01  s.  When  the  forced 
oscillation has been suppressed, MIADRC will be disconnected 
automatically  from  the  power  system.  The  corresponding 
system response dynamics of this test scenario are illustrated in 
Fig.  20.  It  is  shown  that  after  MMA  is  detected  MIADRC 
immediately runs after 5.0 s. And at the same time, the output 
signal ue of MIADRC starts increasing. As a result, the terminal 
voltage  of  G1  fluctuates  in  the  way  that  compensates  for  the 
power disturbance caused by MMA. This voltage fluctuation is 
small  but  meaningful.  It  can  be  calculated  from  Fig.  20  that 
MIADRC  suppresses  the  large  forced  oscillation  with  an 
amplitude  of  1.008  p.u.  by  generating  a  small  voltage 
oscillation with an amplitude of only 0.017 p.u. Compared with

the amplitude of the forced oscillation before MIADRC is put 
into  operation,  MIADRC  achieves  a  91.8%  suppression  rate, 
which  demonstrates  the  feasibility  and  effectiveness  of  the 
whole process of MIADRC strategy. Therefore, the proposed 
MIADRC strategy is effective to suppress the forced oscillation 
stimulated  by  MMA,  thereby  improving  the  power  system 
stability. 

To test the MIADRC performance in a larger test system, the 
IEEE New England 10-machine 39-bus system as shown in Fig. 
21  is  adopted.  A  large  EV  charging  load  is  added  at  Bus  8. 
Through  modal  analysis,  it  is  found  that  the  1.28  Hz 
electromechanical  mode  related  to  (G2,  G3)  vs.  (G5,  G9)  is 
weakly damped. 

signals  from  MIADRC  on  G2,  G3,  G5,  and  G9  immediately 
start  generating.  When  MMA  stops,  control  signals  keep 
generating  until  forced  oscillation  is  suppressed  at  25.0  s. 
Though  in  a  lager  test  system,  it  still  shows  that  as  soon  as 
MIADRC is put in, obvious control signals are formed for each 
generator  which  directly  reshape  the  terminal  voltages  of 
generators in a similar waveform. Owing to the compensation 
function,  it  shows  that  the  corresponding  output  power  of 
generators  is  quickly  suppressed,  although  MMA  is  still 
attacking  the  charging  pile  to  stimulate  forced  oscillations. 
Therefore,  for  the  large  power  system,  the  performance  of 
MIADRC  in  suppressing  the  forced  oscillations  caused  by 
MMA is also validated. 

We  assume  that  MMA  attacks  1.28  Hz  electromechanical 
mode with the amplitude of 0.8 p.u., which is launched at 1.0 s 
and  lasts  until  20.0  s.  The  detailed  response  process  of 
MIADRC  strategy  is  also  considered  and  adopts  the  same 
parameter  as 
test  system.  The 
corresponding dynamics are computed and illustrated in Fig.21, 
where (a), (b), and (c) are power oscillations, terminal voltage 
oscillations, and MIADRC control signals of G2, G3, G5 and 
G9, respectively, and (d) gives the dynamics of the EV charging

VI.  CONCLUSION 

With  the  controllable  EV  charging  load  developing,  this 
paper investigated the huge threat of MMA to the power system 
stability,  which  needs  to  be  taken  seriously  and  investigated 
carefully.  We  mainly  introduced  the  MMA  threat,  analyzed 
characteristics  of  dynamic  responses  to  MMA,  and  proposed 
the MIADRC defense strategy. This research meets the needs 
of  the  stability  of  power  system  dynamics,  and  its  main 
characteristics are concluded as below.

is established. And tests on the hardware platform show that the

3) Expressions of the mean value and standard deviation of 
the dynamic response to MMA are derived. And five laws of 
the forced oscillation stimulated by MMA are concluded. Test 
results verified that this forced oscillation is mainly affected by 
the  mean  response,  and  mainly  dominated  by  three  factors, 
namely, load intensity, system damping, and attack frequency. 
3)  Attack  sources  for  the  MMA  forced  oscillation  is 
distributed  in  numerous  charging  piles  and  are  very  hard  to 
accurately locate and remove. The proposed MIADRC defense 
strategy  can  actively  feedforward  the  compensation  and 
effectively suppress the forced oscillation, which improves the 
system damping and prevents the propagation of disturbances 
to the generators. Test results show that the proposed MIADRC 
can achieve a forced oscillation suppression rate of more than 
90%.
