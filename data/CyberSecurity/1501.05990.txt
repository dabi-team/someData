Cyber Attacks and Public Embarrassment: 

A Survey of Some Notable Hacks 

Jana Shakarian, Paulo Shakarian, and Andrew Ruef 

We hear it all too often in the media: an organization is attacked, its data, often containing personally 

identifying information, is made public, and a hacking group emerges to claim credit.  In this excerpt, we 

discuss how such groups operate and describe the details of a few major cyber-attacks of this sort in the 

wider context of how they occurred.  We feel that understanding how such groups have operated in the 

past will give organizations ideas of how to defend against them in the future. 

Hacking Group Modus Operandi: the Case of Anonymous 

"I think what is, important about Anonymous is that it 
works, I don't know how it works but it works"  
Australian Anon quoted in NineMSN, 05/08/20081 

A video, mostly published on YouTube, announcing a new campaign kicked off many projects in 

the  past. 2  Additionally,  every  “operation”  (“AnonOp”) 

is  declared  beforehand  on  Twitter 

(@YourAnonNews,  @Anon_Central),  tumblr  (youranonnews.tumblr.com)  and  first-hand  Anonymous 

websites, such as anonnews.org and whyweprotest.net. Other commonly used outlets are Pastebin, Pirate 

Bay3 and Facebook (Anonymous News Network).4 Internet Relay Chats (IRC) and image boards, Internet 

forums, as well as wikis serve the purpose of online communication and coordination.i These as well as 

the  partyvan.info 5  hosted  raid  boards  and  IRCs  as  well  as  those  run  by  AnonOps  (anonops.ru, 

i Especially 4chan, 711 chan, Encyclopedia Dramatica, IRC channels, YouTube, and (supported) blogs 
(e.g. anonops.blogspot.com (by invitation only), Legion News Network and AnonNews.org as news outlets, 
whyweprotest.net (Anonymous supported website originally in support of operation Chanology, but 
expanded to service the organization of protest initiatives and campaigns, grass root activism), and 
Anonywebz.com (Anonymous tool network), social networking services like Twitter and Facebook are 
used to organize real world protest

anonops.net)  are  apparently  used  to  garner  support  for  ideas  from  individual  Anons.  The  websites  of 

collaborating hacktivist groups, too, may explain the mission and extend the opportunity to participate to 

the  visitor.6 One  chan  user  might  post  a  call  to  arms  where  s/he  perceives  something  is  wrong  or  has 

potential of being fun. If enough other users agree a date is set on which the operation is launched.7 If the 

initial  recruiting  process  was  unsuccessful,  nothing  will  happen.  Factors  that  might  motivate  an 

Anonymous-attack  (i.e.  further  the  recruitment  process  to  an  individual  idea)  are  the  lulz-potential i, 

perceived  arrogance  of  the  potential  target,  and  perceived  Internet  censorship  or  other  ethical  or  moral 

challenges.8 The latter may be secondary or even afterthought for the mere justification of the hacks for 

the public eye and the decisive moment is the actual possibility to achieve the desired results (although 

the ensuing real world consequences may not necessarily have been anticipated fully).9  

The  most  often  employed  tactic  in  Anonymous  &  Co.’s  campaigns  is  the  distributed  denial  of 

service attack (DDoS). As with the some of the other DDoS attacks discussed in previous chapters, the 

DDoS attacks of Anonymous rely on DDoS tool provided to the hacktivist participants.  These tools were 

somewhat more advanced than the software used by Russian hacktivists in the Georgia cyber campaign 

(chapter  3),  but  unlike  the  “voluntary  botnet”  used  by  pro-Israel  supporters  against  Hamas  (chapter  4) 

they do not allow a central C&C total control over the user’s computer.  The creation of such tools allows 

Anons to participate with virtually no hacking skills – while still contributing their computing resources. 

The most widely known software of this sort in use by Anonymous includes the Low Orbit Ion Cannon 

(LOIC) and the RefRef web script10. The latter of which was meant to replace the former in September 

2011 since LOIC retains the IP-address of the senders, which lead to numerous arrests of Anons.11 The 

RefRef web script is a command-line based Java site which exploits SQL and Javascript vulnerabilities in 

i According to Adrian Crenshaw (“Crude Inconsistent Threat”) this is what appears to draw the most 

supporters

order  to  exhaust  the  server  supporting  the  website.i The  Low  Orbit  Ion  Cannon  is  a  legitimate  tool  to 

stress-test a web-application by sending a large amount of requests to the webpage to see, if it can handle 

it (“bandwidth raep”). It was written in C#, is available in three versions (manual, server-controlled, and 

in JavaScript) and can be found on any major open source code repository. Individual users download the 

application  and  opt  their  computer  to  become  part  of  the  botnet  which  is  employed  in  Anonymous’ 

DDoS-attacks;  one  form  of  membership  is  thus  the  mere  contribution  of  computing  power  to 

Anonymous’ resources. LOIC also features a connection to an IRC channel in order to coordinate the load 

of packets send from the individual computers. Unbeknownst to a large number of participants in illegal 

DDoS-attacks may be the fact that LOIC does not encrypt or hide the IP-addresses of the senders. The 

target computer’s website logs all IP-addresses of incoming requests which in turn can be traced back to a 

single computer. 12  

Another  prevalent  Anonymous  tactics  requiring  somewhat  more  hacking  skills,  but  less 

computing  resources  is  the  SQL  injection,  which  exploits  weaknesses  in  the  database  of  a  website  – 

previously described in chapter 3. In its attack on HB Gary Federal and its head, Aaron Barr, a handful of 

Anonymous and affiliated hackers gathered compromising documents and emails this way. Captured data 

usually is “dumped”, i.e. published on Pastebin or most recently on Anonpaste.  More rarely, the obtained 

data  is  used  for  In  Real  Life  (IRL)  pranks  –  the  staging  of  real  world  events  such  as  unwanted  pizza 

delivery  or  using  social  engineering  to  have  a  SWAT  team  called  to  the  respective  residence 

(“swatting”).13 Other  ends  through  the  mean  of  SQL  injection  include  the  defacement  of  websites,  in 

which the original content is substituted by pictures or messages of the intruders or the hijacking and/ or 

redirection of the target website. In the latter cases the website would either cease to be under the control 

of its original authors or redirect to another site as selected by the hacker(s). 

i The tool exploits the fact that most web sites save the .js file of an incoming request on their own server, since the 

request is still working the packets bounce back and forth on the target server, exhausting its resources (THN, 
07/07/2011)

Targeting Governments, Corporations, and Individuals: Notable Hacks on Anonymous 

Anonymous meanwhile is featured in the media almost every week with either claiming or being 

found  responsible  for  cyber-attacks  against  selected  targets.  It  would  not  make  any  sense  to  recap  a 

chronology of Anonymous’ attacks as the resulting long list would probably have a lot of holes: the media 

coverage of Anonymous- acts depends either on largesse or popularity of the target. 

Habbo Hotel Raids 

Long  before  Anons  engaged  in  hacks  for  which  the  collective  know  is  famous  and  feared  for, 

4chan’s Ur-Anonymous raided their targets. Protesting against Habbo’s ban on African-American avatars 

and accusing Habbo’s social moderators of racism the virtual game made a great target for raids. Habbo 

Hotel raids began in mid-2005 in which avatars looking like a wealthy African-American in business suit 

(to  some  reminiscent  of  the  Samuel  Jackson’s  Pulp  Fiction  character  Jules)  obstruct  entry  to  the  pool. 

This  hack  already  signifies  two  important  motifs  for  the  collective  action  of  the  Anonymous  we  know 

today: perceived discrimination as well as the humungous lulz potential.14

African-American avatars by creating avatars of African-American businessmen who blocked 

access to the pool. Source: KnowYourMeme15  

“Pool’s  closed”  became  a  catch-phrase  for  the  Habbo  raids  that  resulted  in  4chan  exercising 

otherwise  rare  censorship  and  moderation.  A  year  later  Habbo  -raids  culminated  in  an  unprecedented 

organized raid across four countries (UK, USA, Germany, and Australia) that resulted in the site being 

knocked offline. The Habbo-raids are also a precedent for the counterproductive actions that bring about 

what (at least part of) the momentary Anonymous force set out to prevent in the first place and which will 

form  the  core  of  the  criticism  of  Anonymous  years  later:  In  the  aftermath  of  the  summer  2006  attacks 

Habbo  Hotel  administrators  programmed  the  automatic  ban  of  African-American  avatars  with  afro  and 

suit.16  

Internet Vigilantism 

In  December of 2007 in  an act of Internet vigilantism17 Anonymous hackers  aided the arrest of 

Canadian Chris Forcand by impersonating teenage girlsi.18 He would subsequently be brought to court on 

charges  related  to  pedophilia.19   In  summer  2012,  Anonymous  followed  up  on  this  initiative  against 

pedophiles  in  launching  the  Twitter  hashtag  “#TwitterPedoRing”  to  invite  pedophiles  on  the 

communication network to join.  Week later 190 offenders were arrested by the U.S. Immigrations and 

Customs  Enforcement,  though  no  reference to  Anonymous  was  made.  In  August  2012 the  Anonymous 

Twitter account, @YourAnonNews, asked its 615,000 subscribers to report the account “@many501611” 

spam  who  had  published  pornographic  pictures  of  young  boys. 20    Other,    instances  in  which  the

propagation of evidence of perceived injustice through the Internet resulted in real-life consequences for 

the perpetrator include a South Korean girl who refused to clean up after her dog on a subway and whose 

subsequent  harassment  brought  her  on  the  brink  of  suicide,    the  tactless  Zhang  Ya,  whose  inhuman 

remarks  on  the  suffering  of  the  victims  of  the  Sichuan  earthquake  in  2008  eventually  got  her  arrested, 

American pioneer spammer, Alan Ralsky, receiving mailbox spam in truck loads, the New York City cop, 

Patrick Pogan, who attacked an unsuspecting cyclist and would have gotten away with it, if it was not for 

the video of the incident being spread all over the Internet.21 Internet vigilantism is neither an invention of 

4chan nor the Anonymous collective nor constrained to North America.i  

Project Chanology 

Anonymous  first  real-world  protest  brought  thousands  donning  Guy  Fawkes  masks  onto  the 

streets  in  numerous  cities  and  countries  to  protest  against  the  Church  of  Scientology.  Churches 

experienced real-world pranks, like harassing phone calls, black faxes (in order to waste ink)22, pizzas and 

taxis they did not order23 as well as letters with what turned out to be harmless white powder24.  Project 

Chanology  was  sparked  by  the  leak  of  an  insider  video  of  an  interview  with  actor  Tom  Cruise  talking 

about  his  life  in  the  sect.25 The  subsequent  forceful  attempts  by  the  Church  to  retract  the  video  were 

perceived as a metaphorical example for the general restrictiveness the organization is often criticized for. 

The  initial  momentum  that  kicked  of  immense  headaches  for  the  Church  of  Scientology  was  an 

anonymous post on 4chan/b: “it is time to do something great”.26,27 In January 2008 self-confessed Anons 

originating from image boards like 4chan, Partyvan.org, and 711chan amongst others officially launched 

“Project  Chanology”  by  posting  a  video  on  YouTube  entitled  “Message  to  Scientology”.28 Besides  the 

real-world protests, Anons rendered the official website of the Church of Scientology inaccessible by way 

i Clay Shirky authored an insightful book (“Here Comes Everybody – The Power of Organizing Without 
Organization”) on online group action, which argues that it does not only take new forms of technology, but also 
new forms of behavior.

of DDoS-attacks and captured and published literature for which adherents normally have to pay.29, 30  In 

the course of three weeks, Project Chanology encouraged over 8,000 harassing phone calls, 3.6 malicious 

emails, 141 million hits against the church web sites, 10 acts of vandalism, 22 bomb threats, and 8 death 

threats.31 The  Internet  activists  employed  online  tools  like  JMeter  and  Gigaloader  in  DDoS-attacks  and 

the exploit of computer security vulnerabilities like Cross-site Scripting.32 Botnets and the Low Orbit Ion 

Cannon (LOIC) had their debut as Anonymous’ tools in Project Chanology.33, 34 Scientology responded 

with attempts to obtain restraining orders for their premises and identify the Anons who organized local 

protests.  One  of  the  exposed,  Gareth  A.  Cales  of  Los  Angeles  reported  legal  threats  and  general 

harassment  by  Scientology  members. 35 His  account  also  includes  details  on  the  organization  of  the 

protests associated with Project Chanology. Mark Bunker and other critics of the Church of Scientology 

released a video encouraging the protests to remain legal and were surprised that Anons appeared to heed 

the  advice. 36  Four  years  later,  in  February  2012,  still  some  protesters  wearing  Guy  Fawkes  masks 

beleaguer Scientology churches.37 The two-pronged approach showed effect: The resounding response to 

the Project Chanology not only made the organizers aware of the possibilities of the online organization 

of a social movement, but it also appears to have refined Anonymous’ character. While the majority of 

the Anonymous collective prior was interested in the lulz-potential of an undertaking38, with the protest 

against an enigmatic organization known for its attempts to censor public information about itself, many 

Anons appear to be spurred by the perceived righteousness of this quest. 39  

Arab Spring 

Anonymous targeted government websites of countries in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula 

as  well  as  Asia  Minor  that  found  themselves  engulfed  in  civil  uprisings  in  2011  –  the  Western  world 

would  call  it  hopefully  “Arab  Spring”.  Anons  used  their  computers  and  knowledge  to  support  the 

protesters on the ground, whose governments in many cases had resolved to deny them access to social 

media or the Internet altogether. For each country, Anonymous launched a new “operation”. Starting with 

7 

 
 
 
 
Excerpt from Introduction to Cyber-Warfare: A Multidisciplinary Approach 
(Shakarian, Shakarian, and Ruef) 

“Operation Tunisia” and “Operation Egypt”  affiliates of the collective and sympathizers took down the 

governments’ computers with DDoS-attacks.40  

Figure:  2011,  Anonymous  consequently took  up the fight with the  Syrian government  after  it 

clamped down violently on public protesters.Source: PLF, Operation Syria41 

The PLF’s Commander X boasted in a chat-interview that his organization kicked off Tunisia’s 

“Jasmine  Revolution”  by  stealing  compromising  information  on  the  government  and  leaking  it  to 

WikiLeaks.42,43 Other media outlets stress the dire living conditions in Tunisia, amongst others the high 

unemployment and inflation as well as the lack of political freedom as causes taken to Tunisian streets 

after  the  self-immolation  of  Mohamed  Bouazizi  on  December  17,  2010.44,45 The  press  acknowledged 

Anonymous’ support of the protesters on the ground by taking down at least eight government websites 

with DDoS-attacks (including websites of the president, prime minister, the ministries of foreign affairs 

and  industry,  as  well  as  the  stock  exchange)46 and  defacing  some  of  them47.  Anonymous  also  provides 

means  and  knowledge  to  activists  on  the  ground  to  conceal  their  online  identity  in  order  to  prevent 

prosecution  and  coordinate  their  activities  with  the  events  on  the  ground.48 As  Commander  X  stated  in 

regard  to  their  participation  in  various  episodes  of  the  “Arab  Spring”,  besides  the  admittedly  mostly 

negative attention  Anonymous and its collaborators earn with each campaign, the goals are to deny the 

targets  (here:  governments)  lines  of  communication  and  to  “encourage  the  protesters  on  the  ground”.49

(Shakarian, Shakarian, and Ruef) 

The initial motivation to join in the uprising for one Anon was the Internet censorship as exercised by the 

Tunisian government.50 Subsequently a host of Anons identified with the struggles of the revolutionaries 

in the  respective  countries and  sought to alleviate their  plight  by  doing  whatever they  could  to  provide 

them with avenues for information exchange51 while at the same time denying them to their opponents. 

The  Tunisian  governments  attempt  to  identify  political  activists  by  phishing  online  for  their  social 

networking  or  email  accounts 52 was  countered  by  a  subdivision  of  Anonymous,  the  Internetfeds.  A 

greasemonkey  script  made  available  to  the  Tunisian  protestors  would  override  the  governments’ 

spyware.53 They  also  translated  and  distributed  information  on  how  to  conceal  IP-addresses  and  other 

techniques to obscure individual identities in French and Arabic.54 Anonymous’ involvement did not stop 

with  the  ouster  of  Zine  el  Abidine  Ben  Ali.  The  new  Tunisian  Anons  proceeded  to  use  online  tools  to 

fight alongside the new moderate Tunisian government against the pressure it experienced from Islamist 

fringe  groups.55 To  circumvent  Internet  censorship  in  Egypt,  Anonymous  aided  in  the  restoration  of 

proxies and mirrors in order to guarantee information flow to benefit the revolutionaries.56 The Egyptian 

authorities  had  blocked  twitter.com  and  other  social  media  apparently  in  order  to  aggravate 

communication between protestors.57 Anons targeted websites of the Egyptian government and ministries 

with  DDoS-attacks.58 In  both  operations  the  trickster-natured  among  the  Anons  still  found  pleasure  in 

real-world  pranks,  like  flooding  the  respective  embassies  with  unwarranted  pizza-orders.59 In  August 

2011,  Anonymous  consequently  took  up  the  fight  with  the  Syrian  government  after  it  clamped  down 

violently  on  public  protesters.  The  website  of  the  Syrian  Ministry  of  Defense  was  defaced  with  an 

encouraging message to the Syrian people.60   

Besides the above mentioned, the governments of Yemen61,62, Algeria63, Zimbabwe64, and Italy65 

also drew the ire of the online collective, which targeted associated websites with more or less extensive 

DDoS-attacks.66 The  predecessor  to  these  diverse  operations  associated  with  the  “Arab  Spring”  could 

9 

 
 
 
Excerpt from Introduction to Cyber-Warfare: A Multidisciplinary Approach 
(Shakarian, Shakarian, and Ruef) 

perhaps  be  found  in  Anonymous’  engagement  in  Iran’s  post-election  crises  in  2009.  Back  then  Anons 

intercepted the propagation of hit lists depicting protestors distributed by pro-government groups.67 

HBGary Federal and Aaron Barr 

The InternetFeds, an AnonOps spin-off of skilled black hat hackers engaged in what appears to be 

a “personal” vendetta on Aaron Barr, HBGary’s CEO, who had claimed to have identified key actors after 

infiltrating Anonymous.68 After mocking Barr online and obtaining all his passwords via SQL injection 

the hackers were amused to have him “watch” how they hijacked his email and all Internet social media 

and stole data from internal company emails he had sent to his coworkers.69 DDoS attacks brought down 

hggary.com  and  hbgaryfederal.com.70 The  latter  was  breached  using  SQL  injection,  which  exploited  a 

security flaw in the custom-made content management system (CMS) the company had employed.71 So 

called rainbow tables appeared to have immensely alleviated the quest to garner the hashed passwords of 

Aaron Barr and COO Ted Vera.72 Barr had apparently re-used one password over and over, “kibafo33”, 

which  allowed  access  to  other  company  email-inboxes  since  Barr  enjoyed  administrator  rights. 73 

Ultimately this led to compromising HBGary’s founder, Greg Hoglund’s rootkit.com website by way of 

hijacking  his  email  account.  The  hackers  then  impersonated  Hoglund  in  an  email-conversation  with  an 

associate  in  order  to  obtain  the  last  bits  of  information  necessary  to  gain  control  over  rootkit.com.74 

Besides  defacing  the  website,  the  intruders  also  resolved  to  publish  the  user  database. 75 Ted  Vera’s 

repeatedly used password enabled the hackers to access the support server that hosted the shell accounts 

of  many  HBGary  employees  and  which  enabled  them  to  upgrade  Vera’s  personal  account  through  the 

exploitation  of  a  personal  escalation  vulnerability,  which  gave  the  hackers  full  access  to  HBGary’s 

system.76 Gigabytes of data were now immediately at the hand of the intruders. More than sixty thousand 

company emails were published on the Pirate Bay file-sharing site.77 Another case apparently motivated 

by revenge was the hack into Sony’s online Playstation store and the DDoS-attack against the Playstation 

10 

 
 
 
 
Excerpt from Introduction to Cyber-Warfare: A Multidisciplinary Approach 
(Shakarian, Shakarian, and Ruef) 

website. 78  Sony  had  sued  PS3-hacker  George  Hotz  (aka  “GeoHot”),  who  had  become  famous  for 

unlocking various iPhone versions79 before he managed to gain administrator-rights to the entire system 

memory  and  the  processor  of  the  PS3  system  in  early  2011.80 An  abrupt  settlement  in  the  case  was 

reached in April 2011 with neither side disclosing the full terms, but on the part of the phreaker/hacker 

was the deletion of all his information on the PS3-hack from the Internet.81 Hotz was subsequently hired 

by  Facebook,  but  found  himself  just  months  later  with  Lady  Gaga’s  start-up  social  networking  site, 

Backplane.82 

Straightforward Operations 

Anonymous’ goals become apparent when looking at those campaigns that aim at institutions that 

are either held responsible or perceived to embody the objectionable with DDoS-attacks. In some cases 

sensitive  material  is  published  after  the  successful  intrusion  of  hackers  into  the  target’s  system.  A 

prominent  example  is the charge  under  which  attacks  against  copyright  companies  were  launched. The 

effort was later extended to also aim at companies that ceased business relation with the whistle-blower, 

WikiLeaks,  after  the  publishing  of  sensitive  U.S.  diplomatic  cables  (Operation  Payback). 83  In  this 

instance, Anonymous officially became a supporter of WikiLeaks, its co-founder, Julian Assange as well 

as  Bradley  Manning,  a  U.S.  soldier  who  had  leaked  confidential  information  on  America’s  military 

campaign in Iraq.  

The  term  “anti-security”  refers  to  a  movement  conceived  in  the  late  1990s  to  counteract  the 

cyber-security  industry’s  tactic  of  provocatively  exploiting  vulnerabilities  in  order  to  increase  sales84. 

Apparently, Anonymous joined by LulzSec85 takes the viewpoint that governments employ similar tactics 

to  justify  legislation  that  monitors  Internet  behavior  and  allows  censorship  and  surveillance  (Operation 

AntiSec).  In  its  quest  to  safeguard  online  privacy,  the  hacktivists  encouraged  the  defacement  of 

government  websites  and  leaking  of  data  obtained  through  breaches  into  the  systems  government 

11 

 
 
 
 
Excerpt from Introduction to Cyber-Warfare: A Multidisciplinary Approach 
(Shakarian, Shakarian, and Ruef) 

organization,  banks  and  other  institutions  deemed  to profit from  infringements on  user privacy.86 Other 

digital rights-related reasons for hacks under the AntiSec banner are racial profiling, copyright laws and 

the War on Drugs87. The attack against the British SOCA presented the debut of AntiSec, followed by the 

publication of material from the Cyberterrorism Defence Initiative Sentinel program88, and the release of 

private information apparently obtained through SQL-injection from sources related to the governments 

of  Brazil,  Zimbabwe,  and  Tunisia.  So  far  Anonymous  attacked  U.S.  defense  contractor  Booz  Allen 

Hamilton, U.S. Central Command, U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Marine Corps, and the U.S. 

Air  Force  in  a  spree  dubbed  “Military  Meltdown  Monday”.89 The  December  2011  Stratfor-hack  where 

subscribers’ credit card information and emails were stolen and later published on WikiLeaks was also 

perpetrated by the LulzSec member(s) now working under the Anonymous banner90. 

Other campaigns launched under the Anonymous banner include Operation Vendetta91 launched 

after a wave of arrests of alleged Anonymous-affiliated hackers in March 2012 to help Anons escape the 

authorities. This campaign is the second one to date that entails a major real-world component in that it 

aims to set up safe-houses and an “underground railroad”92 to lead sought-after hackers to countries which 

don’t  have  extradition  treaties  with  the  prosecuting  authorities.  A  popular  hacktivist  who  apparently 

benefitted from this operation is Christopher Doyon aka Commander X, whose People’s Liberation Front 

had  joined  forces  with  Anonymous  in  this  campaign  again.  After  having  been  arrested  in  Santa  Cruz, 

California, as the “homeless hacker”93 who protested against a recent county ban on outdoor sleeping by 

launching DDoS-attacks94, Doyon reportedly found an interim sanctuary in Canada95. 

Software for the Legion: Anonymous Products 

In early 2012 Anons engaged in the creation of software. Partially in protest to existing 

applications, such as the social music platform, AnonTune, and partially in the quest of opening new 

12 

 
 
 
 
Excerpt from Introduction to Cyber-Warfare: A Multidisciplinary Approach 
(Shakarian, Shakarian, and Ruef) 

avenues beyond hacking as in the launch of its operating system, Anonymous OS live. Besides the file-

sharing site, AnonPaste, the collective also launched a WikiLeaks-like site in an attempt to control and 

deepen the public impact of their hacking activity96. Both platforms were meant to serve as data dumps. 

AnonTune 

In April 2012 Anonymous launched a social music platform that provides streaming songs from 

third  party  users  (e.g.  YouTube)  for  users  to  compile  into  playlists  and  share.  Initiated  by  online 

discussions the ambitions of an individual, who created and uploaded a prototype, generated the technical 

support necessary to render AnonTune capable of handling large requests aside from the user interface97. 

It  is  planned  that  AnonTune  will  grant  its  users  anonymity,  shielding  them  from  prosecution  and 

copyright law suits while offering a service better organized and less expensive than similar platforms.98 

Upon its launch AnonTune will be a project borne purely of the Internet. Once more, the creators of this 

online  forum  must  not  have  ever  been  in  personal  physical  contact  and  may  even  be  spread  out  over 

different continents.

  After  the  operators  of  PasteBin,  hitherto  Anonymous’  favorite  forum  to  publish  captured  data, 

was  found  to  be  compromised,  Anonymous  affiliates  associated  with  Operation  Anti-Sec  together  with 

the People’s Liberation Front launched its own data-sharing website, AnonPastei, in April 2012.99 Jeroen 

Vader, owner of PasteBin, announced an increase in censorship of the site100. He further admitted that at 

times he shares his logs -a register of the IP-addresses of users - with law enforcement agencies, which

drew  immediate  recognition  on  the  part  of  Anonymous,  which  introduced  its  new  website  with  the 

following comment: 

"As a recent leak of private emails show clearly, Pastebin is not only willing to 
give up IP addresses to governments – but apparently has already given many 
IPs to at least one private security firm. And these leaked emails also revealed a 
distinct animosity towards Anonymous”

  AnonPaste allows the user to determine when the post is to be deleted at a time increment of his 

or  her  choosing.  The  creators  of  this  new  haven  for  captured  data  promote  a  secure  forum  without 

advertisements, censorship or connection logs, and which retains only encrypted data.101 AnonPaste was 

registered  in  the  New  Zealand  –administered  Tokelau  (.tk)  which  allows  everybody  to  register  a  free 

domain. It relies solely on donations as advertisements are not featured.102 

When  WikiLeaks  sought  to  verify  the  data  captured  during  the  intrusion  into  the  intelligence 

company,  Stratfor  in  December  2011,  part  of  Anonymous  was  frustrated  with  the  slow  release  of  their 

bounty  and  launched  Par:AnoIA  (Potentially  Alarming  Research:  Anonymous  Intelligence  Agency).  It 

also appears to be an attempt at solving a problem high-volume websites are struggling with everywhere: 

the sensible organization of humungous amounts of data.103 The  Anons who run the page say their sole 

task is to present the data others from the Anonymous collective have hacked in a usable format.104 At the 

time of writing neither AnonPaste nor Par:AnoIA were workable websites.

Chapter Summary  

This chapter represents the attempt to outline what the hitherto most notorious hacker collective, 

Anonymous,  might  look  like  on  a  whiteboard.  Publically  available  hints towards  its  structure  had  been 

followed and explored: the possible initial “directorate” recruited from an idealist veteran hacking group 

as well as the better known online seedbed, a mingling place for contempt and counterculture. Whatever 

the beginnings, Anonymous is driven by a set of motivations largely shared by those whose actions are 

most visible: freedom of information and the right to online privacy. There are a certain number of online 

arenas which are used to decide upon, plan and organize a hack – mostly using SQL-injection or a related, 

basic hacker skill that grants access to target systems. Personal, confidential and otherwise compromising 

data is later dumped on one or more popular file-sharing sites mainly to give evidence of the intrusion.  

Mostly after capturing sensitive data, but not requiring this more or less clandestine step a DDoS-attack is 

used to render the target website inaccessible. In some cases website defacement prominently displayed 

the reason and goals of Anonymous’ interference. Over its history the collective experienced dedicated 

functional spin-offs (e.g. LulzSec) or ideological derivatives who sought to be more “pure” (e.g. MalSec) 

whose history and demise is antidote as well as defining element of Anonymous’ structure. The political 

hacktivists  also  encountered  like-minded  collaborators  (e.g.  PLF),  who  probably  helped  emphasize  this 

facet of the collective. Finally, this chapter sought to display representative motivations, modi operandi, 

and tools through the brief description of select hacks. In the wake of Anonymous’ refocusing or just the 

skilled public relation work of a few Anons, the chapter concludes with examples for the nascent stage of 

16

(Shakarian, Shakarian, and Ruef) 

products:  a  music  portal,  two  dumping  sites  and  a  highly  controversial,  quickly  retracted  operating 

system. 

Anonymous might be more the history of hacking exploits than a social structure, but in the role 

of  Sabu  alone  it  contradicts  its  claims  of  being  a  legion  of  countless  “everybodies.”  Sabu  organized, 

motivated  and  lead  many  of  the  highly  popularized  hacks  in  2011.  His  absence  after  the  March  2012 

arrests  was  noticeable  and  it  forced  LulzSec  to  reinvent  itself.  The  global  wave  of  arrests  in  2011  and 

especially  those  in  early  2012118 are  perceived  by  some  as  crippling  for  the  Anonymous  collective119, 

which  can  only  be  the  case  for  an  organization  that  is  hierarchically  structured.  Detentions  can  have 

effects on the activity-level of a group only, if the arrested individuals were crucial in the organization of 

the activities. Whether there is or was a handful of people conceiving and directing the politically aware 

and active Anonymous, the collective appears to be much more than a loosely-knit organization now. The 

collective action presented in its every hack represents an enormous challenge not only to the reader who 

seeks  to  wrap  her  head  around  this  virtual  phenomenon,  but  also  to  the  social  scientist.  Initially  self-

proclaimed  members  of  the  collective  without any  real-world  connection to  fellow  hacktivists,  political 

Anons  may  form  real  local  groups  with  regular  meetings  and  faces,  real  names.  In  the  virtual  meeting 

spaces (user) name recognition still applies and allows for virtual groups and Anonymous-spin offs to be 

formed.  But  the  numerical  majority  of  the  collective  remains  elusive  with  many  different  levels  of 

possible  engagement  ranging  from  sympathizers  to  participants  in  DDoS-attacks.  The  world-spanning 

virtual social network, which conceives, decides, plans, and organizes hacking exploits is what and who 

Anonymous  really  is:  a  number  of  IRC-channels,  blogs  and  message  boards  accessed  from  (at  least) 

several  hundred  thousand  devices  all  around  the  globe.  4chan  might  have  been  its  cradle,  but  so  far  it 

seems Anonymous has risen beyond this tactless, seedy playground with its bored opportunists, tricksters 

and hustlers.

(Shakarian, Shakarian, and Ruef) 

So far it seems the political activists have by and large conquered the movement, though it cannot 

completely abandon its trickster nature. The Janus-faced character of the collective is reflected in its every 

aspect from activity, to the motivation and the understanding of itself is due to the myriad of individuals 

who have used the Anonymous platform for very different reasons. In a handful of interviews some self-

proclaimed Anons try to fixate an image for the collective, but due to the elusiveness of its membership it 

will be difficult to instill and maintain. The political hactivists the Anonymous collective depend on its 

favorable depiction in the media since the nature of its preferred modus operandi, the employment of the 

low-orbit  ion  cannon  in  DDoS-attacks,  hinges  on  a  large  number  of  volunteers.  The  advance  in  new 

alleyways with the launches of the Anonymous operating system, the music sharing website as well as the 

data dump sites, albeit with different levels of success, help diversify the collective, but are also evidence 

of the lack of guidelines for members, that could serve as identity markers.  

Suggested Further Reading 

Parmy Olson’s 2012 book We Are Anonymous – Inside the Hacker World of LulzSec, Anonymous, 

and the Global Cyber Insurgency, is a very readable synergy of documentary and novel that explores 

aspects of the Anonymous collective by following the exploits of a fictitious hacker. Some of Olson’s 

story is mirrored in insider Cole Stryker’s account of the legendary 4chan message board in Epic Win for 

Anonymous – How 4chan’s Army Conquered the Web (2011). 

For a more, general perspective on how the Internet has changed social movements, we recommend 

Clay Shirky’s 2008 Here Comes Everybody- The Power of Organizing Without Organizations. Finally, 

one of the best known early computer espionage stories is Clifford Stoll’s classic The Cuckoo’s Egg – 

Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which provides a first-hand account of the 

KGB-hack. This was later made into a television documentary entitled The KGB, the Computer, and Me.
