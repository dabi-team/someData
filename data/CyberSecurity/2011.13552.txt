Abstract
A power system is a complex cyber-physical system whose security is critical to its function. A major challenge
is to model and analyze its communication pathways with respect to cyber threats. To achieve this, the design
and evaluation of a cyber-physical power system (CPPS) testbed called Resilient Energy Systems Lab (RESLab)
is presented that captures realistic cyber, physical, and protection system features. RESLab is architected to
be a fundamental tool for studying and improving the resilience of complex CPPS to cyber threats. The cyber
network is emulated using Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) that acts as a gateway for the physical and
protection devices to communicate. The physical grid is simulated in the dynamic time frame using PowerWorld
Dynamic Studio (PWDS). The protection components are modeled with both PWDS and physical devices
including the SEL Real-Time Automation Controller (RTAC). Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) is used
to monitor and control the grid. Then, exemplifying the design and validation of these tools, this paper presents
four case studies on cyber-attack and defense using RESLab, where we demonstrate false data and command
injection using Man-in-the-Middle and Denial of Service attacks and validate them on a large-scale synthetic
electric grid.

1 Introduction

The electric grid is transitioning to a smarter grid that employs
advanced communication technologies. With advanced com-
puting and communications, cyber-security has proven to be a
critical issue in power transmission, generation, and distribu-
tion systems. Cyber adversaries can modify or create data that
can impact the grid’s normal operation and potentially destabi-
lize its operating point causing cascading failures. Earlier this
year, an unidentiﬁed threat successfully compromised the ad-
ministrative systems of the European Network of Transmission
System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), with the poten-
tial to compromise 42 transmission system operators (TSOs)
across 35 member states in Europe [1]. Other attacks are also
widely known such as the Ukraine attacks [2], where an attacker
targeted three distribution units to cause a power outage after
intruding into the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
(SCADA) system. Attacks like Pivnichna [3] caused a power
outage, while Stuxnet [4] allowed control of programmable logic
controllers (PLCs), by overspeeding the centrifuges in a nuclear
plant.

It is necessary to propose defense mechanisms for such zero-day
attacks. The use of ﬁrewalls, intrusion detection systems, and
intrusion prevention systems is important, but these tools may
not work eﬃciently on stealthy coordinated attacks. Hence, we
need to employ the latest tools and techniques to make solu-
tions that are more intelligent and capable of detecting complex
attacks. Machine learning, including deep learning, or even
artiﬁcial intelligence, oﬀer advantages that can aid cyber and
physical attack detection and localization. These techniques
are data-intensive, where more data typically provides a better
solution. One way to generate those real-time data sets is to
mimic those attacks and defense mechanisms using a testbed.

This paper presents our Resilient Energy Systems Laboratory
(RESLab) testbed that forms an environment for researchers
and stakeholders to understand the impact of cyber-attacks and
validate their defenses. It provides a platform to evaluate how
the power and communication networks perform together based
on real-world systems and events, including communication
protocols, operations, and latency requirements. It allows other
researchers to develop and test intrusion detection tools for
defending and mitigating real cyber attacks.

These are the major contributions of this paper:

1. To introduce RESLab, a cyber-physical power system
testbed that is designed to study resilience problems
and solutions in large-scale power systems RESLab is
a mix of emulators, simulators, and real devices that
allow us to evaluate multi-stage cyber threats to the
power system.

2. To model realistic data ﬂows in the RESLab testbed
using a large-scale exemplar power system based on
utility architecture. This enables us to implement and
validate scenarios impacting grid resilience such as
false data and command injection uses cases.

3. To compare RESLab with other testbeds and present
how RESLab is able to implement and validate realistic
use cases for grid cyber-resilience.

4. To implement Denial of Service (DoS) and Man-in-the-
Middle (MiTM) attacks and validate them by studying
their impacts on the normal power system operation.
5. To provide a platform for data collection and visualiza-
tion by integrating monitoring tools such as Packetbeat
and Zabbix, Snort for intrusion detection, and a cyber-
physical energy management system application.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we evaluate
testbeds that model a cyber-physical power system and allow
real-time experiments. Section 3 presents the architecture and
components of RESLab. The threat model for this work is pre-
sented in Section 4. Section 5 demonstrates its implementation
in RESLab with four use cases. Then, we present the analysis of
the attacks and their impacts on the physical system. The results
are analyzed in Section 6.

2 Cyber-Physical Power System Testbeds

In this section, we ﬁrst review testbeds that focus on investigat-
ing vulnerability of power critical infrastructure, including their
challenges and limitations. Previous works range from applica-
tions in wide-area protection and monitoring in transmission and
generation, to distributed energy resources (DERs), to micro-
grids and distribution systems, and to operation domains such as
Energy Management Systems (EMS) and Distribution Manage-
ment Systems (DMS). The comparisons in this section consider
ease of deployment and troubleshooting, design complexity, and
cost of implementation. Then, we motivate RESLab, outlining
its contributions, unique features, and how it ﬁlls existing gaps.

2.1 Testbeds and platforms

A cyber-physical testbed architecture is implemented by net-
working together simulators, emulators, and hardware. The
quality of a cyber-physical testbed is measured by its success
in advancing the research and applications that it supports. It
includes a platform enabling communication between compo-
nents, a system for data collection, aggregation, visualization,
and a way of executing and evaluating cyber security incidents
against the system under study.

We present all the reviewed testbeds in Table 1 based on the
power and cyber simulators, communication protocols, software
and devices, system level, intrusions type, and the application of
DERs.

2.2 Network representation

Various testbeds such as [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] focus on evaluat-
ing impact for physical use cases (e.g., cyber-attacks on power
ﬂows, loss of load or synchronism, protection systems, and
microgrids) while using networking hardware. Other testbeds
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15] use network simulators, but the network
simulator’s primarily focus is on communication algorithms
such as congestion control or bandwidth allocation schemes.
For performing cyber-physical studies in a testbed, network
emulation is the preferred alternative to simulation. While a
simulator demonstrates the behavior of a network, an emulator
functionally replicates the behavior of the network. Though
some simulators provide features such as System-in-The Loop
(SITL) [11, 16] and Tap bridge [15] to integrate external devices
or virtual machines (VMs), those features are not scalable to
large systems.

Virtualization and emulation enable scalability.
In [17], the
vSphere ESXi virtualization environment is used to simulate
network-based attacks; however, these scenarios are not speciﬁc
to SCADA and focus on web browsing and ﬁle transfers. The
vSphere environment is reset before each simulation test run;

this provides built-in mitigation against any damage resulting
from an attack simulations.

The selection of a speciﬁc platform requires design decisions that
are based on trade-oﬀs in cost and accuracy. Network devices
such as ﬁrewalls and routers can be included in the design,
but are expensive for a large scale CPS. Network simulators
such as Opnet, Omnet, and Network Simulator-3 (NS-3) can
be cost-eﬀective, but they do not provide a platform for real-
time data processing of industrial protocols such as IEC 61850,
Distributed Network Protocol version 3 (DNP3), inter-control
center communications protocol (ICCP), and Modbus.

The Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) provides a plat-
form to run diﬀerent applications, such as iptables for ﬁrewall,
Snort for intrusion detection, and services such as Secure Shell
(SSH) for remote access. CORE is used for emulating smart grid
networks in [18], where the authors compare existing works of
co-simulation and discover CORE to be suitable for large-scale
simulations. Similarly, in [19] an Army microgrid is simulated,
and its communication network is emulated with CORE, where
results demonstrate the ability to implement cyber intrusions and
evaluate the impact on the microgrid. However, testbeds that
use CORE have not yet integrated network monitoring tools.
Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) oﬀers a tool for launching
and managing virtual machines (VMs) to emulate large scale
networks [20] called Minimega. It supports Virtual Local Area
Networks (VLANs) with conﬁgurable bandwidth and quality
of service (QoS); thus, it can be used with a router’s operating
system and Linux kernels to emulate a communication network.
Additionally, a power system and cyber co-simulation environ-
ment called SCEPTRE [21] is being developed by SNL to allow
high-ﬁdelity simulation of SCADA protocols with hardware-in-
the-loop such as PLCs and remote terminal units (RTUs), using
Minimega to manage the VMs.

A Hierarchical Engine for Large-scale Infrastructure Co-
Simulation (HELICS) is developed by National Renewable En-
ergy Laboratory for large-scale co-simulation, using oﬀ-the-self
power system, and communication markets [22]. This frame-
work integrates discrete-event simulators, such as NS-3, and
time-series simulations such as for power ﬂows.

2.3 Power system representation

Power system simulators such as real-time digital simula-
tor (RTDS), OpalRT, or Typhoon have been used in several
testbeds [23, 24, 25, 11, 7, 6, 26, 27, 8, 10, 28]. These expen-
sive hardware solutions are essential for experiments on electro-
magnetic transients or power electronics, DERS, or microgrids.
PowerWorld Simulator and Dynamic Studio (PWDS) provide so-
lutions for large-scale power system modeling in the steady state
and transient stability time frames [29, 30, 31]. The testbeds that
use hardware devices such as SEL relays, phasor measurement
units (PMUs), or RTACs for their experiments face challenges
in understanding vendor-speciﬁc industrial control system (ICS)
protocols. The testbed solutions in [23, 24, 25, 32, 9, 27]
use physical hardware and consider ICS protocols such as IEC
61850, C37.118 in their experiments.

2.4 Operational technology protocols

Widely-known tools in information technology (IT) security,
such as Ettercap and Metasploit frameworks, are not tailored to
operational technology (OT) or attacks to power systems. For
example, a MiTM attack would need to be speciﬁc to SCADA
protocols, and representing such attacks is imperative for de-
fense. Incorporating attacks and defense into a testbed requires
knowledge of the protocols as it involves inspecting and modify-
ing packets. Vendor-speciﬁc protocols that are not open source
are challenging to incorporate and evaluate in such environ-
ments.

2.5 Constraints on use cases

Existing testbeds often lack strong demonstrations of cyber intru-
sions. Several existing testbeds [23, 32, 33, 34, 35, 12, 36, 37]
mention implementation of cyber intrusions in their platforms
but do not clearly demonstrate speciﬁc use cases including how
the intrusions are performed. Some testbeds that use MiTM
attacks [25, 7, 26, 6, 8] do not show how those attacks are
incorporated. For example, a MiTM attack can be performed
in diﬀerent ways such as address resolution protocol (ARP)
cache poisoning, internet protocol (IP) spooﬁng, or hypertext
transfer protocol (HTTP) session hijacking. Some testbeds such
as [11, 38] use Ettercap or Metasploit frameworks but have
limitations in carrying out goal-oriented MiTM cyber-attacks.

Realistic use case support is a major feature of a testbed. For ex-
ample, extensive research has been proposed on defense against
FDI attacks, where state-of-the-art methods adopt linear algebra
and deep learning [39, 40]. However, works that address FDI
attacks tend to make unrealistic assumptions on the adversary’s
knowledge and capabilities.

2.6 Motivation for RESLab

RESLab aims to facilitate academic research and to bridge the-
ory to practice through collaboration with industry and academia.
Therefore, it must exemplify these qualities: (1) Ability to vali-
date domain-speciﬁc use cases; (2) Ability to mimic and reﬂect
the real-world complexity of industrial systems by incorporating
hardware devices; (3) Support high-impact research activities;
(4) Cost eﬀectiveness; (5) Design for fast veriﬁcation of results;
(6) Ability to transfer results to power system industry; (7) Abil-
ity to transfer the testbed itself to industry or other researchers;
and (8) Ability to serve as an educational platform.

Because RESLab is a cyber-physical testbed, these features are
also important: (1) It is imperative that the testbed allows the
development and evaluation of cross domain (e.g., cyber, physi-
cal, protection system) analyses including identiﬁcation of cyber
threats that impact power systems; (2) Ability to implement and
validate realistic threats using real-time simulated models and
data as well as oﬄine models; (3) Ability to evaluate cyber-
physical contingency analysis involving simulating and patching
vulnerabilities and their impact on risk; (4) Ability to connect
simulators, emulators, and physical components.

These RESLab features fulﬁll the gaps in existing testbeds:

1. Virtualization and emulation: RESLab uses vSphere
and CORE for virtualization, including power system

simulation in a dedicated VM, and to operate network
components such as an IDS and ﬁrewalls.

2. Open source protocols and industry integration:
RESLab’s implementation of OpenDNP3 follows the
IEEE 1815 standard [41], hence convenient for other
researchers to replicate the experiments. RESLab uses
PWDS [29] to emulate the DNP3 outstations in real-
time, making the solution easily deployable to industry.

3. Use case realism support: RESLab addresses use case
shortcomings by supporting multi-phase cyber intru-
sions as presented by the joint report of NERC, E-ISAC,
and SANS-ICS [42]. Other solutions fail to address
early attack stages. Our testbed enables a complete rep-
resentation of FDI and FCI attack vectors in a realistic
environment from early-stage environment.

4. Large scale system cyber-physical analysis: RESLab
enables research to develop entirely new systems. For
example, it is supporting the use case of a cyber-
physical EMS. Such a new system needs to support
algorithms that enable cyber-physical state estimation.
Its integration and application of large-scale realistic
cyber-physical models, including a synthetic test case
on the Texas footprint that includes power [43] and
communication [44] systems, with balancing authori-
ties and market participants strengthens the test case to
mimic a realistic cyber-physical power system.

5. Transferability and interoperability: The virtualization
in RESLab makes the migration to other platforms such
as VirtualBox and VMware simple. This approach
makes the testbed cost-eﬀective compared to testbeds
that use RTDS or OpalRT.

6. Dataset management: Few datasets for cyber physical
testbeds are publicly available. RESLab provides such
a platform that aggregates real-time traﬃc and power
data along with IDS alerts and enables integration of
third-party tools including visualization and data ana-
lytics.

3 RESLab Cyber-Physical Testbed Architecture

RESLab is designed to reﬂect realistic power and cyber compo-
nents based on the synthetic electric grid model on the Texas
footprint [43], where its communication model is introduced
in [44]. Fig. 1 presents a high-level view of the RESLab archi-
tecture, showing an example of one substation and one utility
control center (UCC), with their power system cyber-physical
components and data ﬂows. More detailed data ﬂows which
include balancing authorities and demilitarized zones (DMZs)
are presented in our prior work on ﬁrewall policies that follow
NERC standards [46].

In the simpliﬁed model of Fig. 1, the main data ﬂow depicted
is DNP3 traﬃc, which is initiated at the UCC, where there is
a DNP3 master and a SCADA server that act as our central
control and human machine interface (HMI) applications. At
the substation level, there is a DNP3 outstation (DNP3 O/S)
which has the data from the ﬁeld devices that the UCC needs to
monitor.

Figure 2: The logical connections between the VMs hosted in
RESLab.

3.1 Cyber network emulation: CORE

RESLab uses CORE, which is an open source network emulator
published by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. The soft-
ware allows the creation of several BSD jails, which are similar
to Linux containers, that can be connected to emulate realistic
communication networks. These containers are used to emulate
routers, ﬁrewalls, personal computers, and Linux servers in the
communication network. CORE can also tap into the hosts’ Eth-
ernet connections to connect with external networking devices
and VMs housed within vSphere.

In our testbed, CORE is hosted as one of the VMs, with each
of its virtual network interfaces connected to diﬀerent VLANs,
such the Sub LAN and Utility LAN shown in Fig. 2, to emu-
late a wide-area-network (WAN) between substations and UCC.
CORE also has a bridge connecting the cyber-physical EMS
application (Section 3.5) that monitors real-time traﬃc from
PWDS as well as network traﬃc in CORE. The WAN setup
has direct connections between the gateway routers of the UCC
and substation subnets. The routes within this architecture are
created by running Quagga [48] services in the routers which
employ open shortest path ﬁrst (OSPF) [49] as the routing pro-
tocol.

From left to right in Fig. 2, the connections are: (1) VM host-
ing DNP3 master, (2) VM running CORE, (3) VM running a
centralized cyber-physical EMS application, and (4) the PWDS
VM. To show the emulated network, Fig. 3 details the network
topology: the DNP3 master and SEL-RTAC are connected to the
CORE through virtual interface [1]; interface [2] forwards Snort
IDS alerts from control center router to the EMS application;
the VM running the large-scale synthetic electric case in PWDS
is connected through interface [3].

3.2 Power system simulation: PWDS

In RESLab, PWDS models the dynamic behavior of an electric
power system in the transient stability time frame. It does inter-
active control [43], and serves as a general interface for DNP3
outstations [29, 30]. An outstation, as deﬁned from a power
system operational point of view, typically includes one substa-
tion and its devices, including branch breakers, generators, load
breakers, and shunts. The DNP3 tags generate binary data, such
as the status of all devices, and allow the devices to be controlled
by other DNP3 masters/clients. The DNP3 tags can also be set
to send analog data, such as measurements of generator real and
reactive output, branch power ﬂow, and bus voltage, as well as

Figure 1: Power system cyber-physical architecture with one
substation and a utility control center.

The RTUs, RTACs, and relays monitor the system status, collect
data, and control physical devices such as circuit breakers, which
we call digital devices as they have only two states, or generators
and load which we call analog devices. The RTUs and RTACs
can control generators’ output and aﬀect loads. The relays
can trip a circuit breaker to isolate a faulted circuit. The data
from the Process Level is concentrated in RTUs and RTACs and
then transferred to the Substation Level. Within the UCC, the
DNP3 master collects the information from each substation for
a complete view to understand and control the system. In [47],
a typical structure of data concentration and engineer access is
presented using the SEL RTAC in SCADA systems, where the
RTACs in substations communicate with RTACs in UCC and
EMS for data collection and control.
The UCC and substations are in diﬀerent locations, and in
RESLab they are interconnected by an IP network, but they
can also be connected through a serial link. At each location
we have one router: the substation router and the UCC router,
which also act as ﬁrewalls because they are conﬁgured to allow
only DNP3 packets and block unwanted traﬃc. Fig. 2 illustrates
how RESLab follows this data ﬂow pipeline and incorporates
real-time power system simulation using PWDS, a physical
SEL RTAC, an OpenDNP3 master application, and an emulated
communication network using CORE.

In the testbed, PWDS acts as a collection of DNP3 outstations
connected to the substation’s control network (shown as Sub
LAN in Fig. 2). The emulated DNP3 master and SEL RTAC
are housed in a control center network to represent software-
and hardware-based control platforms. Each of the emulated
components are hosted in a virtual machine management en-
vironment, named vSphere. The vSphere environment allows
for the creation and management of a large number of VMs. In
RESLab, connections between emulated and physical compo-
nents are made to scale the network depending on the use case.
Next, the purpose and functionality of each testbed component
is analyzed.

The DNP3 master application in RESLab uses the PyDNP3 li-
brary, a Python wrapper for the C++ based OpenDNP3 module,
to run the master as a console and a graphical user interface
(GUI) application. The purpose of the master application is
to continuously monitor the status of the circuit breakers, gen-
erators, and loads in the DNP3 outstations that are running in
PWDS. The application also forwards the response of DNP3
outstations, as well as connection status, to the central appli-
cation via CORE’s WAN. This application is conﬁgurable to
change the polling rates and visualize real-time traﬃc. It runs
in an isolated VM but exists in the UCC LAN with its default
gateway set to 172.16.0.4, which is the UCC router (see Fig. 3).

and connections to: [1] DNP3 master, [2] CYPRES app, and [3]
PWDS DNP3 outstations.

3.4 RTAC integration

allowing DNP3 masters to change generator setpoints. A DNP3
master is hosted in a VM running OpenDNP3. Another VM is
running SEL acSELerator software [50] and is used to conﬁgure
the RTAC as a DNP3 master.

PWDS also serves as a simulation engine with a generic interface
for integration into other applications [31]. In our experiments ,
PWDS simulates the power system in a real-time environment in
which cyber threats and defense mechanisms are implemented.
The large-scale test case on the Texas footprint [43, 44] is imple-
mented as our exemplar power system and is being maintained
at Texas A&M. CORE’s WAN is being used to forward breaker
status and control commands between VMs.

3.3 DNP3 and master application

DNP3 is extensively used by electric utility companies in North
America for communication between equipment [51]. The pro-
tocol utilizes the master/outstation architecture. A network can
be conﬁgured to have one DNP3 master communicate with more
than one DNP3 outstation, referred to as a multi-drop network.
Alternatively, there can be one DNP3 master that communi-
cates with one DNP3 outstation, or a one-on-one network, as
implemented in this paper.

DNP3 messages contain a 10-octet DNP3 header and a maxi-
mum 292-octet DNP3 payload, which are carried over TCP/IP
packets. The DNP3 header contains sync, length, link control,
destination, and source address ﬁelds with a cyclic redundancy
check (CRC) to ensure data integrity. The DNP3 payload is
comprised of many 16-octet data blocks, with a 2-octet CRC for
each block.

The purpose of the CRC is to ensure that bits have not been
changed accidentally during its journey from source to end
node. Some intruders may modify the traﬃc yet fail to modify
the CRC which can be easily detected at the receiver or by
implementing DNP3 speciﬁc decoders in IDS. Inside the DNP3
payload, function codes identify the operation the outstation
performs. The index identiﬁes the device in the outstation the
master is asking to perform the operation on or retrieve data from.
These are the function codes used in our simulations: Conﬁrm
(0x00), Read (0x01), Read (0x2), Select (0x03), Operate (0x04)
Direct Operate with Acknowledge (0x05), Solicited Response
(0x81), and Unsolicited Response (0x82).

RESLab also incorporates the SEL-3530 RTAC to explore dif-
ferent variants of DNP3 master. The RTAC provides ﬂexible
system control with integrated management of security, conﬁgu-
ration, and logic. It supports multiple communication protocols,
such as DNP3, Modbus, and IEC 61850, and comes with an
embedded IEC 61131 logic engine [52]. RTAC has been utilized
in several hardware-in-the-loop testbeds for data collection and
signal conversion [25, 35], but they do not use it for communi-
cation studies or to emulate cyber adversaries associated with
speciﬁc hardware.

Within RESLab, for each substation there is a DNP3 master
in the RTAC to collect analog input data, such as power ﬂow,
current, and generator output, in addition to binary input data,
such as the status of branches, generators, loads, and shunts from
PWDS. Furthermore, each client in the RTAC can control the
corresponding devices through analog and binary outputs such
as to change generator setpoint in Mega Watts (MW) and device
status (on/oﬀ). Thus, the integration of an industrial standard
control device in RESLab allows researchers to gain a deeper
understanding of how cyber adversaries can impact the devices
and the system as well as develop more practical detection and
defense logic in the ﬁeld.

3.5 Cyber-physical energy management system

A centralized cyber-physical energy management application
that our team developed named Cyber-Physical Resilient Energy
Systems (CYPRES) is designed to house algorithms for mon-
itoring and analysis, run SCADA applications, and visualize
the system. CYPRES is developed and deployed in RESLab
as an exemplar use case for the testbed. CYPRES aggregates
information from the cyber side CORE emulation environment,
the power side from PWDS, as well as from the DNP3 masters
regarding DNP3 communication status. CYPRES is used to
visualize the control network of the synthetic utilities and their
substations in the synthetic power grid. To detect instrusions,
it also probes real-time traﬃc, where CYPRES then performs
data fusion from multiple sensors in the synthetic network. The
CYPRES application is currently envisioned to be housed at a
central location (i.e., at a balancing authority or utility) and used
to analyze the system with respect to cyber intrusions. Further-
more, CYPRES provides cyber-physical situational awareness
in RESLab using attack tree visualizations. These visualizations
can be tailored to network administrators or to power system
operators to provide an actionable map of risk related to cyber
and physical assets and impact, and to recommend mitigation ac-

tions for the identiﬁed risks within a network, e.g., by informing
how to protect against cascading failures.

cause physical impact. The RESLab framework can not only
support MiTM and DOS, but can also integrate other attack
vectors.

3.6

Intrusion detection system

The role of an IDS is to detect cyber intrusions. Rule-based
and anomaly-based IDS’s are predominantly used in industry,
but they lack the capability of detecting zero-day attacks. As
an initial approach, RESLab integrates the Snort IDS which is
used to detect and generate alerts for cyber intrusions. Snort
tutorials [53] are followed to deﬁne rule sets, preprocessors,
decoders and change conﬁguration. Currently in RESLab, Snort
is protecting the control center and substation LANs by running
as a service within the routers. The alerts are forwarded to the
CYPRES application in real-time.

For the synthetic power system case, the dataset from the attacks
comprises packets with a destination port of 20,000, which is the
default DNP3 port. From the ﬁltered dataset, the frequency of
communication between the master and outstation is analyzed
in Section 6 to show to the eﬀectiveness of the exemplar cyber
intrusion scenario in impeding DNP3 communications.

3.7 Storage and visualization

RESLab implements a platform that the team has created to
probe the traﬃc at all the network interfaces inside CORE, to
collect the traﬃc, to use Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana (ELK)
stack to store the traﬃc in an Elasticsearch index, and to vi-
sualize them using Kibana dashboard with the Packetbeat plu-
gin [54]. One can conﬁgure the Packetbeat plugin to modify the
number of interfaces and the type of traﬃc to probe. Kibana
provides a platform to write Lucene queries to ﬁlter out a search
in the Elasticsearch index. RESLab uses Logstash to collect
Snort alerts to visualize in Kibana. In addition to ELK stack,
RESLab also integrates Zabbix [55] for network monitoring, as
it provides a platform to conﬁgure custom alert rules and trig-
gers. We have conﬁgured a Zabbix server in the base operating
system hosting CORE, and the Zabbix agents in all the routers in
CORE. The agents within CORE use the CORE control network
to interact with the server using ZBX protocol [55].

4 Threat Model

4.1 Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attack

MiTM is one of the oldest forms of cyber intrusion, where a
perpetrator positions itself in a conversation between two end
points, to either passively eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the
endpoints, making it appear to be a normal exchange of infor-
mation. MiTM encompasses diﬀerent techniques and potential
outcomes, depending on the threat model. During the second
stage of our presented threat model, we compromise the target
outstation and its router through performing an ARP spoof attack
by poisoning the ARP cache of both the substation’s gateway
and DNP3 outstation [56]. Then, in the third stage, we modify
control and monitoring traﬃc to have diﬀerent implications on
the electric grid.

Such tampering of commands and measurements would nor-
mally go undetected by the outstation using CRC error checking,
since the data chunk in the DNP3 payload’s has its CRC recalcu-
lated by the adversary before the modiﬁed packet is forwarded
to the outstation. The intruder causes false command injection
(FCI) and false data injection (FDI) attacks by ﬁrst storing the
DNP3 polling response for the targeted outstations, then manip-
ulating measurements in some cases, and commands in other
cases, as well as manipulating a mix of both to carry out one of
the most critical contingencies presented in our N-x contingency
discovery paper [57]. Such an attack is hard to be detected by an
IDS such as Snort, if the intruder not only tampers the command
and takes care of the CRCs.

In RESLab, the MiTM attack is developed and implemented to
change binary and analog commands sent by the DNP3 master
to the outstation as well as the polled response from DNP3
outstations. The intruder not only modiﬁes commands but also
eavesdrops and then modiﬁes the current state of the system by
tampering its real-time measurements. In Table 2, the procedure
for performing a MiTM attack in RESLab is listed. The details
on the various combination of attacks that are performed in the
third stage of the threat model is presented through four use
cases detailed in Section 5.

Widely-known cyber threats such as the Ukranian and Stuxnet
attacks have been multi-stage attacks, which are a serious con-
cern. However, due to the nature of these attacks, and the wide
range of time scales involved at each stage, they are challenging
to plan and study. Hence, RESLab is intended to mimic an
electrical utility environment allowing for experimentation of
individual threats, which enables us to develop and test solutions
at each step in the attack vector.

The threat model we present and implement in this paper is based
on emulating a multi-stage attack in the large-scale synthetic test
system’s communication model. In the ﬁrst stage, the adversary
gains Secure Shell (SSH) access to a machine in the substation
LAN. In the second stage, the adversary performs steps that are
tailored to the system under study and to power system protocols,
allowing the adversary to achieve MiTM and DoS attacks that

4.2 Denial of Service (DoS) attack

As another attack vector, we implement a DoS attack to exhaust
victim nodes’ processing capability and link bandwidth. There
are many diﬀerent methods of DoS attacks that can be used,
which include but are not limited to: user datagram protocol
(UDP) ﬂood, internet control message protocol (ICMP) ﬂood,
and Ping of Death (PoD) [58]. While each of these DoS attack
types use diﬀerent Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layers
such as application, presentation, session, transport, network,
data link or even at physical layer protocols to carry out the
attack, all DoS methods attempt to disrupt the communication
channels of the targeted node. In our threat model, the intruder
within the substation LAN targets routers at the substation and at
the control center by ﬂooding the routers with ICMP traﬃc. The
impact of these DoS attacks is then observed and analyzed based
on round trip times (RTT) and throughput of the communication
channel by varying the strength of the attacks such as the length
and delay between the ICMP packets infused to disrupt the
DNP3 session.

5 Impact of Cyber Threats on Power Operation

The synthetic Texas 2000-bus case [43, 44] is a publicly avail-
able power system test case. This system is N-1 secure, which
means the system can still operate securely with one device
is out, and it is diﬃcult to cause disruption by exploring N-2
contingencies. Hence, the use cases in RESLab leverage re-
sults from our prior work [57] on identifying the most critical
multiple-element contingencies based on graph theory and line
outage distribution factors (LODFs), which are located in the
regions targeted in our use cases (Fig. 4).

Assume branch (x,y) means from Bus x to Bus y in the Texas
2000-bus model. To illustrate the contingencies, if branches
(5262,5260), (5263,5260), (5317,5260), (5358,5179) are open,
there will be four overﬂow branches in the system, which are
branches (5071,5359), (5138,5071), (8086,8083), (8084,8083).
Branch (5262,5260) and (5263,5260) are located in Substation
GLEN ROSE 1 (560), Branch (5317, 5260) is at Substation
GRANBURY 1 (601), and Branch (5358, 5260) is at Substa-
tion RIESEL 1 (631). The overﬂow branches are at Substation
WACO3 (399), JEWETT1 (1195) and FRANKLIN (1200).

Besides, in those substations there are several generators. We
have studied that if those generators are compromised, there
will also be a contingency in the system. These generators are
Gen 5262, 5263, 5319, 5321, 5360, 7098, 7099. Gen 5262
and 5263 are at Substation GLEN ROSE 1 (399), Gen 5319
and 5321 are at Substation GRANBURY 1 (601), Gen 6360
is at Substation RIESEL 1 (631), and Gen 7098 and 7099 are
at Substation WADSWORTH (968). When these generators
reduce their output and the Branch (5260,5045) in Substation
STEPHENVILLE (390) is open, there will be another overﬂow
in Branch (5286, 5046) at Substation STEPHENVILLE (390).

Thus we assume that the adversary has the intent and the re-
sources to target the most critical branches and generators,
where disrupting their control causes severe impact. Speciﬁ-
cally, we present four use cases to show how cyber threats can
compromise a resilient power system. These use cases involve
binary and analog command modiﬁcation, measurement and
status modiﬁcation. Before exploring the scenarios, we present

RESLab’s experimental setup which allows us to collect data
at various locations and analyze them from a cyber-physical
perspective.

5.1 Experimental setup

The DoS and the MiTM attacks for the scenarios are performed
while running RTAC and OpenDNP3 applications as the DNP3
masters. The resources used to perform all the experiments
are illustrated in Table 3. Virtual LANs (VLANs) are used to
ensure that traﬃc is forwarded by the emulated routers in CORE
and to segregate the substation network from the control center
network.

In these simulations, we use a multi-master architecture where
each master monitors and controls a substation separately. While
the master monitors and controls outstations, the adversary sniﬀs
all the measurement traﬃc (requests and responses) from the
substations. We capture network traﬃc at four locations in the
network (outstation, master, adversary and substation router) to
evaluate the impact of MiTM attacks on these four use cases.
Since the adversary acts as the middle man between the substa-
tion router and outstation, we validate the MiTM by checking
if the DNP3 packets received at the substation router and at the
master are identical, and if the DNP3 packets at the outsation
and adversary are identical. To test the detection of DoS and
MiTM attacks, we operate Snort at the substation and control
center routers in a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
mode by enabling preprocessors and decoders and including cus-

tom rules for ARP, DNP3, and ICMP traﬃc. Then, we present
the alerts along with the physical traﬃc to correlate the alerts
with the measurements and command tampering.

5.2 Class 1: False Command Injection (FCI)

A MiTM attack that modiﬁes binary control commands using
relay control blocks can cause line overloading [59]. To achieve
this, the adversary ﬁrst parses the measurements by sniﬃng the
DNP3 responses from the outstation. Then, it sniﬀs the DNP3
binary OPERATE command and forges them. The adversary
modiﬁes commands with function codes of 3 and 4 (SELECT
and OPERATE command) from the RTAC, and it modiﬁes com-
mands with function code 5 (DIRECT OPERATE command)
from the OpenDNP3 master application. The adversary mod-
iﬁes all the CLOSE commands to TRIP, forcing to open the
critical branches identiﬁed and causing line overloads in four
other branches, shown in the data from the scenario in Fig. 5.
This scenario is referred as use case 1 (UC1).

The intruder can also modify analog control commands to
change the setpoints in generators along with a binary com-
mand to control a branch to cause line overloads. The intruder
ﬁrst inspects the DNP3 packets, changes a collection of gen-
erator setpoints from the real value to 0, and alters the binary
control command as in UC1. This scenario compromises seven
generators and one branch, referred as use case 2 (UC2).

Fig. 6 shows the actual generation output in each substation
WADSWORTH, RIESEL, GRANBURY, and GLEN ROSE along
with the Snort alerts during 5th, 10th, and 11th mins of the sce-
nario. The intrusion in these substations takes place during the
8th and 9th mins. The intruder’s goal is to overload the trans-
mission line near substation STEPHENVILLE, accomplished by
tampering of the analog set points, as observed in the interval
9-11th minute in Fig. 6.

5.3 Class 2: False Data Injection (FDI) with FCI

The MiTM intruder can also perform FDI with the FCI to cre-
ate more diﬃcult-to-detect attacks. First, the intruder falsiﬁes
polled measurements, causing the operator to re-send a control
command to the ﬁeld device. Then, the intruder modiﬁes the
control command, as in the previous use cases, by changing
the generator setpoint. The actual generation measurements
for the same seven generators in UC2 are falsiﬁed to 20 MW,
and the ﬂow measurement coming from branch [5260, 5045]
is changed to 3000 MW, which is above its capacity. Based on
these observations, the operators or a pre-deﬁned control logic
within devices such as an SEL RTAC, would re-send the control
command to increase the generators’ output and open the branch.
However, once sending those commands, the intruder modiﬁes
the setpoints to 20 MW, making the physical system unreliable.
This scenario is referred as use case (UC3).

Fig. 7 shows the system after the output of a generator in sub-
station WADSWORTH is changed in the polled measurements
by the intruder from 1000 MW to 20 MW as observed in the
master and the router during 52nd to 55th min. The Snort alerts
are observed from the 53rd to 56th mins. The alerts at 50th and
51st min are due to an attack in other targeted substations such
as GLEN ROSE, RIESEL, GRANBURY, whose generation set
points are tampered.

Another example of a three-stage attack is referred as use case 4
(UC4), where the intruder ﬁrst changes the measurements polled
by the DNP3 master, as in UC3. Once the operator re-sends
the control command, the intruder changes the setpoints from
the real value to a low value, as in UC2, but the intruder also
falsiﬁes the measurement packets, masking the true measure-
ments but showing the original setpoint values. The result is that
the operator believes his/her command has been successfully
received and committed. However, in the true physical system,
the generators’ outputs are decreasing, and opening a line will
then cause an overload.

6 Results and Analysis

In this section, DoS and MiTM attacks are performed and ana-
lyzed on the DNP3 sessions between the masters and outstations
based on the four use cases, which are summarized in Table 4.
The eﬀectiveness of the DoS attack is evaluated by varying at-
tack strength and studying its impact on the RTT and throughput
of DNP3 traﬃc. The time frame of power system operations
compared with the attack time frame plays a major role; for ex-
ample, the time frame of inverter and stator transient control are
in the order of milliseconds, while control of voltage stability,
power ﬂow, and unit dispatch range from 10 to 1000 seconds.
Hence, it is essential to minimize RTT to ensure that the control
commands are processed by the ﬁeld devices on time.

The use cases for MiTM attacks are tested with the RTAC and
OpenDNP3 master. Experiments are conducted by varying the
number of DNP3 masters, as well as the polling interval. Each
master communicates with its substation, and we assume that
5 or 10 master are connected with their respective outstations.
These experiments are performed to study the success rates of
the attacker in causing the desired contingency of each use case.
The adversary is restricted by the available resources in the Linux
containers in CORE, thus the attacks are stochastic in nature. As
the number of masters increases, the amount of traﬃc an intruder
processes increases, which results in higher attack miss rates,
i.e., the probability that the attacker fails to modify a sniﬀed
packet. The results demonstrate the eﬀective implementation
of the use cases by observing the real-time physical side data at
diﬀerent locations in the testbed.

We also study the number of active TCP connections as impacted
by retransmission during the progression of the attack based on
diﬀerent polling rates and varying DNP3 masters. The adversary
success probability, the average retransmission rates, the packet
processing times, and the average RTT for performing each FCI
and FDI attack, and the Snort alert statistics are key characteris-
tics for detection. Snort IDS is used to detect the ICMP ﬂood
attack as well as the ARP spoof attack (Section 4) that reroutes
packets to the adversary and allows modiﬁcations to take place.

6.1 DoS attack evaluation

The DoS attack is performed by increasing the ICMP payload
size for a ﬁxed interval rate, as well as by varying the interval
rate with the ﬁxed payload size, to determine their impact on the
RTT and throughput of DNP3 traﬃc. For all the experiments,
the virtual Ethernet communication links in the network have a
ﬁxed bandwidth of 10 Mbps, with a 160 µs transmission delay.

We ﬁrst run polling at an interval of 30 and 60 s and DIRECT
OPERATE commands from the DNP3 master without any at-
tack, to verify the network performance. Then, either the delay
interval or payload length of DoS traﬃc is altered, and the same
polling and control operations are performed.

The DoS attack is performed by the compromised device in
the substation, encircled in red, as shown in Fig. 3. The DoS
attack is directed at two targets: the substation router and the
control center router, and we seek to determine which device is
impacted more by a DoS event. From the DoS trials directed at
the substation router, we observe that only the broadcast domain
of the substation LAN is exhausted. However, if the attack
is directed at the control center router, the link between the

Fig. 8 shows the generation output at substation WADSWORTH
as observed at four locations. During the intrusion on
WADSWORTH, within the 34th and 44th mins, the adversary ﬁrst
forces the master to take a wrong action to change the generation
output to 1000 MW once the master observes low generation
output at the 34th minute due to modiﬁcation of the measure-
ments of generation output. Further, when the operator takes this
action to address the low generation output, the intruder changes
the command from 1000 MW to 0 MW to cause contingency. To
be stealthier, the intruder also modiﬁes the polled response from
outstation with the same setpoint value of 1000 MW from the
interval 39 to 44 min except at 42nd min, as set by the operator,
to prevent the master from observing the contingency caused by
the intruder in ﬁrst two stages. The snort alerts generated in this
interval are shown in Fig. 8.

two routers as well as the broadcast domain of the substation
LAN are exhausted. Both DoS attacks are performed using
hping3 [60] while keeping a ﬁxed interval rate of 1000 ms and
increasing the payload size of the ICMP packets from 800 bytes
to 1800 bytes in increments of 200 bytes for each trial. It can be
observed from Fig. 9 that average RTT increases with payload
size, and that the attack on the control center router has a higher
impact in comparison to substation router.

Further, DoS attacks are performed by keeping the payload
size of the ICMP packet ﬁxed at 1000 bytes while decreasing
the ICMP packet arrival rate from 1500 ms to 500 ms in step
decrements of 100 ms for each consecutive trial. Fig. 10 shows
that the average RTT decreases with increase in attack interval
as well as the lower attack interval has higher impact on the
control center router in comparison to the substation router.
A DoS attack primarily aﬀects the target’s downstream band-
width. Hence, the average throughput will be aﬀected as the
bandwidth of the link is aﬀected. The average throughput for
the substation router is calculated using the transmission time of
DNP3 packets, as per Eq. 1:

Average T hroughput “

T otal data payload in bytes
T otal transmission time

(1)

The average throughput depends on the command type from
the DNP3 master. For example, the response payload size for
the polling will be quite high compared to the response of the

throughput and goodput at both substation and control center
routers.

OPERATE commands. The goodput is equal to the throughput
if there are no retransmissions.

In Fig. 11, we observe that the throughput and goodput increase
as the payload size increases up to certain extent, then they de-
crease due to congestion in the network. It can also be observed
that the diﬀerence between throughput and goodput increases
as the payload size increases due to high retransmission caused
by the congestion. Similarly, reduced goodput is also observed
when the attack interval is lowered from 1500 ms to 500 ms as
seen in Fig. 12.

6.2 MiTM attack evaluation

In the MiTM attacks, both master and outstation DNP3 packets
are captured at the adversary’s machine located in substation
LAN. Fig. 13 shows Wireshark sniﬃng the DNP3 DIRECT OP-
ERATE command from the master in addition to the response
from outstation. As described in Section 5, the CLOSE com-
mand is replaced by the TRIP command as observed from the
response, as well as the DNP3 log of PWDS as seen in Fig. 13.

The RTT for MiTM attacks is small compared to the RTT for a
DoS attack. In a DoS attack, the RTT depends on the number of
retransmissions, but in a MiTM attack, the RTT depends on how
much time the attacker takes to parse the packet, modify the

6.4 Evaluation of MiTM attack practicality

The successful implementation of the attack use cases requires
the intruder to cause the binary operate (BO) and analog operate
(AO) FCIs and read response (RR) FDIs in a particular sequence
as shown in Fig 17. Due to the resource limitations at the
attacker, such as sniﬃng from a single network buﬀer, it can
only accomplish the modiﬁcation operations with a success
probability of p, q, and r for BO, AO, and RR packets separately.
Assuming the number of BO, AO and RR operations to be m, n
and o, the expected number of steps that the intruder has to take
to reach its goal is inverse of the success probabilities, which is
pmqn for UC2, ro pm for UC3, and pmr2o for UC4.

The intruder continues the attack until it reaches its goal to over-
load the branch [5285,5046]. Hence, we evaluate the average
minimum number of FCI and FDI modiﬁcations the intruder has
to perform to reach its target. The success probability depends
on the available resources of the intruder, the master polling rate,
as well as the number of masters polling the measurements.

For UC4, the number of FDI attempts is higher because the pro-
cessing time of an FDI is higher than for an FCI, as it involves
parsing the DNP3 response from outstations that usually have
large payloads. This higher processing time reduces the success
probability of the FDI attack. For UC3, in the RTAC case, an
exception of higher FCIs are observed due to the automated
generation protection control logics incorporated in the RTAC.
The protection logic ensured that the generation setpoint in-
creases when the generation output reading goes below a certain
threshold.

Table 5 shows the minimum number of FCI and FDI attempts
on average that are required to accomplish the ﬁnal goal of
the intruder for each use case with both RTAC and OpenDNP3
master.
From queueing theory, we know that the traﬃc intensity ρ is
computed based on the packet arrival rate λ and the service rate
µ as ρ “ λ
µ [61]. From intruder reference, the arrival rate λ is
determined by the polling rates from the master as well as the
number of DNP3 masters. The service rate µ is ﬁxed since it is
the single intrusion node that processes the incoming traﬃc. The
higher the ρ, the lower is the success probability for the intruder
to modify the traﬃc. In literature, the arrival rate distribution can
be deterministic or random. In our simulation, since we observe
polled traﬃc as well as commands, it can be considered a random

number to forward modiﬁed packet.

payload, recalculate the checksum and CRCs, and to forward
the packet to the target. There is no substantial retransmission
in the case of MiTM attacks, if the intrusion is stealthy.

The occurrence of a MiTM attack is validated both by observing
a rise in RTT compared to the normal operation in Fig. 15 and
from its sequence number graph Fig. 14. Speciﬁcally, in Fig. 15,
the MiTM attack is performed from 200 s to 1000 s, and the RTT
is observed to increase to almost 150 ms during sniﬃng and FCI
attack and to almost 200 ms during FDI attacks on measurement,
indicating the time taken by the adversary’s machine for parsing
and modiﬁcation aﬀects the overall RTT. Additionally, as the
sequence number remains at 18 from 3.3 s to 3.4 s in Fig. 14, it
indicates the attacker used the same sequence number to forward
the modiﬁed packet.

6.3 Use case speciﬁc physical impact evaluation

The physical impact is evaluated based on the four use cases
shown in Table 4, described in detail in Section 5. The target
of the MiTM intruders in UC2, UC3, and UC4 is the same but
they adopt diﬀerent strategies to accomplish it. These use cases
detailed in Section 5 demonstrate increasing complexity. The
time to cause the same overload in branch [5286, 5046] diﬀers
based on the strategy in each use case, as illustrated in Fig. 16.
For Use Cases 2, 3, and 4, the overload occurs at 173 s, 216
s and 541 s, respectively. The diﬀerences in time as well as
the system dynamics are due to the amount and sequence of
intrusions in these three strategies.

certain times, we observe more than 10 active connections, as
some clients lose connection and re-initate a new connection
with a diﬀerent source port number due to the MiTM attacks.
The number of active TCP ﬂows are the indicator of number of
masters connected. Higher variance of connections are observed
in 10 master cases due to higher retransmissions.

The Kibana Query Language (KQL) ﬁlters helps us to ﬁlter traf-
ﬁc, based on the source IP of the DNP3 master (i.e., 172.16.0.2)
and the destination port in the DNP3 outstations (i.e., 20000)
as shown in Fig. 18. A separate Logstash index is created in
Elasticsearch to store real-time snort alerts. Fig. 19 shows the
histogram created with Kibana for diﬀerent types of snort alerts
(ICMP ﬂood, ARP spoof, DNP3 operate) during one of the
scenarios from the use cases.

results in drop of the packet, and that triggers retransmissions
from the sender. The algorithms developed and utilized for FDI
and FCI attacks aﬀect the processing time.

RESLab visualizes the results using ELK stack, where Fig. 18
shows a real-time count of the number of active TCP ﬂows while
the experiments are being performed for the four use cases with
5 and 10 DNP3 masters. Since the number of active TCP ﬂows
is an indicator of the number of connected clients, it helps us
to detect if there are more than intended number of clients. At

By providing a safe proving ground for cyber-attack experi-
mentation, RESLab is a platform to study defense mechanisms,
where its ability to generate real-time datasets and customize
monitoring, visualization, and detection will play a major role
in developing cyber-physical state estimation, situational aware-
ness, optimal response, etc. to prevent impending contingencies.

system. Through four use cases, RESLab shows how such
attacks can impact the electric grid.

To understand the dynamics of the DoS attack, results present the
impact on RTT and throughput due to diﬀerent attack intervals
and payload sizes of ICMP injections in DoS. For understand-
ing the dynamics of the MiTM attack, we analyze strategies
adopted by the intruder to cause the desired contingencies. We
also explore the MiTM attacks with diﬀerent polling intervals
and number of master applications, which impacts on retrans-
mission rates, RTT, and packet processing time. The intrusions
performed in UC3 and UC4 provide the platform to create and
mitigate FDI attacks on state estimation which involves an in-
truder tampering the measurements.

The simulations performed for the substation network in CORE
consisted of one broadcast domain. This causes the intruder to
observe the traﬃc related to all the substations. The number of
DNP3 masters are limited to 5 or 10 in our scenarios which is
enough to enable the intruder to accomplish its N ´ x contingen-
cies such that its x components are in these 5 or 10 substations.
However, they are modeled through a single substation network
in CORE. Hence, the intruder’s capacity to inject modiﬁed traf-
ﬁc is resource-limited due to having a single substation LAN
in CORE, as the intruder can only process traﬃc on the single
network buﬀer.

7 Conclusion

A cyber-physical testbed provides a platform to understand se-
curity threat events and their impact on the power grid. This
will help to facilitate grid resiliency to cyber intrusions.
In
this work, we present our testbed RESLab, where its architec-
ture makes use of components such as vSphere, CORE, PWDS,
Snort, among others, to successfully emulate the physical and
cyber component of a synthetic large scale electric grid, and we
demonstrate the use of DNP3 based control and measurement
traﬃc to and from substation ﬁeld devices. The methodology
and mechanics behind our testbed are demonstrated through
four use cases utilizing two types of cyber intrusion experiments:
DoS and MiTM. The dynamics of the intrusions are validated
by implementing use cases targeting speciﬁc parts of the grid.
These intrusion events are evaluated from their respective char-
acteristic features, including latency (RTT), throughput, and
goodput in the emulated WAN network.
