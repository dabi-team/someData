Abstract—The Internet of things (IoT) will make it possible
to interconnect and simultaneously control distributed elec-
trical loads. Various technical and regulatory concerns have
been raised that IoT-operated loads are being deployed with-
out appropriately considering and systematically addressing
potential cyber-security challenges. Hence, one can envision
a hypothetical scenario when an ensemble of IoT-controlled
loads can be hacked with malicious intentions of compromising
operations of the electrical grid. Under this scenario, the
attacker would use geographically distributed IoT-controlled
loads to alternate their net power injections into the electrical
grid in such a way that may disrupt normal grid operations.
This paper presents a modeling framework to analyze grid
impacts of distributed cyber-attacks on IoT-controlled loads.
This framework is used to demonstrate how a hypothetical
distributed cyber-attack propagates from the distribution
electrical grid, where IoT-controlled loads are expected to
be installed, to the transmission electrical grid. The techno-
economic interactions between the distribution and transmis-
sion electrical grids are accounted for by means of bilevel
optimization. The case study is carried out on the modiﬁed
versions of the 3-area IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) and
the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder. Our numerical results
demonstrate that the severity of such attacks depends on the
penetration level of IoT-controlled loads and the strategy of
the attacker.

Keywords—Cyber-security, distributed cyber-atacks, internet-
of-things, smart appliances, smart grid, transmission and distri-
bution integration.

INTRODUCTION
Large-scale deployment of internet-based devices, at
both the customer- and grid-ends, expose electrical grids
to an imminent threat of cyber-attacks. These threats are
much alike to other internet-connected services. Previous
studies have primarily focused on cyber-attacks that directly
compromise power utilities, large generation companies or
individual bulk generators [1], [2]. On the other hand,
distributed cyber-attacks launched from an ensemble of
compromised IoT-controlled loads can be equally perni-
cious. This paper aims to analyze the threats posed by such
distributed cyber-attacks.

The penetration level of

IoT-controlled devices in
homes, ofﬁces and businesses that are directly connected
to the electrical grid and can be compromised remotely has
been constantly increasing. Compromised IoT devices have
already been used to launch devastating distributed denial
of service (DDoS) attacks on web services. For instance,
a recent attack on the Dyn, a domain name service (DNS)
provider, caused major internet websites, e.g. Twitter, to
be unavailable for hours [3]. Using specialized malware,
attackers captured myriads of IoT-controlled devices (us-
ing their default passwords) and routed trafﬁc from these
captured devices to the Dyn. The distributed nature of this
attack enabled the attackers to circumvent standard defense
mechanisms (e.g., those that detect a large volume of trafﬁc
from a single IP address).

The scale and impact of the Dyn attack presages similar
attacks on the electrical grid. Speciﬁcally, an attacker can
potentially be able to modify the power consumption of
compromised IoT-controlled loads to maliciously cause
load shedding, reduce security margins, or even trigger a
cascading failure. As opposed to conventional cyber-attacks
on the grid that target a relatively small number of power
large generation companies or individual bulk
utilities,
generators [1], [2], the distributed cyber-attacks considered
in this paper target a large number of small IoT-connected
loads. Even though these loads can be small-scale and
geographically distributed, potentially across multiple dis-
tribution grids, a single attacker is technically capable of
aggregating these loads and modifying their power con-
sumption in a co-ordinated, centralized manner.

Figure 1 shows the interactions between the electrical
grid and the attacker modeled in this paper. The attacker
devises the optimal attack strategy to maximize damage
to the electrical grid by modifying the active and reactive
power consumption of IoT-controlled loads by ∆lp
b and ∆lq
b,
respectively. These modiﬁcations change the power ﬂow in
distribution lines, which in turn change the power ﬂow in
transmission lines. The interactions between the distribution
and transmission grids are modeled by means of bi-level
optimization. This paper models two attack strategies: naive
and insidious. The naive strategy assumes that the attacker
cannot forecast and circumvent the effect of built-in grid
protection mechanisms, e.g. circuit breakers, to maximize
damage, while the insidious strategy accounts for these
effects. Based on the proposed framework, the case study
demonstrates potential grid impacts of such distributed

cyber-attacks.

A. Related Work

Previous studies on cyber-attacks on the electrical grid
have typically focused on centralized attacks in which
an attacker gains access to the supervisory control and
data acquisition (SCADA) system. For example, this attack
mechanism led to the famous stuxnet attack [4]. Distributed
cyber-attacks on the electrical grid have been considered
primarily in the context of false data injection attacks.
this attack mechanism is reported in [5],
For example,
[6], where the attacker hijacks and falsely reports phasor
measurement unit (PMU) readings. That is, the attacker
attempts to maliciously change PMU readings and trick the
grid operator into making scheduling and dispatch decisions
that hamper reliability.

A cyber-attack on an relatively large aggregator of
distributed IoT-controlled loads is modeled in [7]. However,
[7] considers the transmission grid only and does not
account for the interactions between the transmission and
distribution grids, where IoT-controlled loads are expected
to be deployed. Compared to [7], this paper studies cyber-
attacks on IoT-controlled loads located in the distribution
grid.

B. Paper Contributions

This paper makes the following contributions:
1) We describe a bilevel optimization model

that
makes it possible to operate the transmission and
distribution electrical grid coordinately.

2) We devise the optimal attack strategy for a naive

3)

and insidious attacker.
Using the bi-level optimization model and attack
strategy described above, we analyze the impacts
of distributed cyber-attacks on the distribution and
transmission electrical grid.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the model that makes it possible to operate the
transmission and distribution grids coordinately. Section III
describes the model of the attacker. Section IV describes
the model for analyzing the transmission and distribution
grid operations under the attack. Section V describes the
case study and Section VI concludes the paper.

II. STEADY-STATE GRID OPERATIONS

This section describes the models used for the co-
ordinated operation of the distribution and transmission
electrical grids.

A. Assumptions

The transmission and distribution grid models are de-

veloped under the following assumptions:

1)

2)

3)

4)

The proposed transmission and distribution mod-
els are formulated for a single time period, i.e.
inter-temporal and mixed-integer constraints are
neglected.
The transmission grid is operated by the trans-
mission system operator (TSO) using a lossless
dc approximation of ac power ﬂow equations that
can accommodate a meshed network topology.
The TSO is responsible for clearing the whole-
sale electricity market, which is assumed to be
perfectly competitive.
The distribution grid has a tree network topol-
ogy and is operated by the distribution system
operator (DSO) using an SOCP relaxation of ac
power ﬂow equations, i.e. it explicitly accounts
for active power and reactive power ﬂows, as
well as for voltage limits. The DSO is responsible
for scheduling generation resources located in the
distribution grid, as well as for purchasing and
selling power in the electricity market.
The transmission and distribution grids are con-
nected via the single bus. This interface is limited
to the active power exchange of a ﬁnite capacity,
i.e.
internal
resources to compensate its reactive power needs.

Eq. (1) is the objective function of the DSO, which aims
to maximize the gross proﬁt that includes the following
three terms: i) payments collected by the utility from its
customers, ii) operating cost of generation resources located
in the distribution grid, iii) cost of transactions that DSO
performs in the wholesale electricity markets. If pO
b0 > 0,
i.e.
the DSO sells surplus electricity in the wholesale
electricity market, the third term of the objective function
is positive. Alternatively, if pB
b0 < 0, i.e. the DSO purchases
electricity in the wholesale electricity market, the third term
is negative. Note that due to the market regulation, there is a
need to enforce complementarity condition on decisions pB
b0
and pO
b0 that ensures that the DSO cannot simultaneously
sell and purchase electricity in the wholesale market, i.e.
b0pO
pB
b0 = 0. Eq. (2)-(5) enforce the minimum and maximum
limits on the active and reactive power output of generation
resources located in the distribution grid. Eq. (6)-(7) limit
the apparent power ﬂow in distribution lines, while eq. (8)-
(10) represent a relaxation of ac power ﬂow equations,
[8]. The active and reactive power balance for each bus
is enforced in eq. (10)-(13). Note that eq. (12)-(13) model
the power balance for the root bus of the distribution grid
with no generation resource or load connected to that bus.
The active power exchange between the distribution and
transmission grid is limited in eq. (14)-(15). Eq. (16)-(17)
enforce the maximum and minimum limits on bus voltages.
Eq. (18) declares all decisions variables optimized by the
DSO.

active power balance is enforced in eq. (20) for every
bus in the transmission grid connected to the distribution
grid and in eq. (21) for the remaining buses. Eq. (22)-
(23) enforces the maximum and minimum limits on the
active power output of the generation resources located in
the transmission grid. Eq. (24)-(25) limit the active power
purchased or sold by the DSO. The active power ﬂow in
each line of the transmission grid is computed in eq. (26)
and eq. (27)-(28) enforce the active power ﬂow limits.
Primal decision variables of eq. (19)-(28) are declared in
(29), while dual variables are given in line with respective
constraints after a colon.

D. Coordinated DSO-TSO Model

For the DSO model in eq. (1)-(18) and the TSO model
in eq. (19)-(29), we formulate the following model to model

III. ATTACKER’S MODEL

A. Assumptions

The following assumptions are made on the attacker:
1)

The attacker has perfect knowledge of all compro-
mised IoT-controlled loads, their technical char-
acteristics and placement in the distribution grid.
From the attacker perspective,
this assumption
results in the ‘best-case’ attack scenario.
The attacker has perfect knowledge of the trans-
mission and distribution topology, including the
power transfer distribution factors (ωlb). In some
cases, this data can be obtained or estimated from
open sources, e.g. [9]. From the grid perspective,
this assumption results in the ‘worst-case’ attack
scenario.

Eq. (34) is the objective function of the attacker that
jointly accounts for the adversary effects in the distribution
(oA,D) and transmission (oA,T) grids. Parameter Γ ∈ [0, 1]
is used by the attacker to vary the severity of adversary
impacts between the transmission and distribution grids. If
Γ = 0, the attacker intends to affect the distribution grid
only, whereas Γ = 1 indicates the intention to affect the
transmission grid only. Eq. (35)-(36) deﬁne the technical
limits on the ability of the attacker to modify net active

and reactive power injections of IoT-controlled loads, ∆lp
b
and ∆lq
b, located in the distribution grid. Eq. (37) declares
decision variables of the attacker.

Functions oA,D and oA,T can be formulated in multiple
ways depending on the intentions of the attacker. In this
paper, we assume that the only intention of the attacker is
to cause line overload in the transmission and distribution
grids by changing net power injections of IoT-controlled
loads, ∆lp
b, located in the distribution grid. The
impact of ∆lp
b and ∆lq
b on power ﬂows in a tree-structured
distribution lines, can be computed as:

Eq. (38)-(39) compute the change in active and reactive
power ﬂows caused by altering IoT-controlled loads at the
buses that are located downstream from the receiving bus
of line l (r(l)). Since the dc power ﬂow approximation is
assumed for the transmission grid, only the active power
ﬂows will be affected by the attacker:

distribution factors ωlb. Using Eq. (38)-(40), functions oA,U

(43)
(44)

Using eq. (43)-(44), the post-attack values of power ﬂows in
the distribution and transmission grids can be obtained from
the DSO-TSO model in eq. (30)-(33). This can be achieved
if the model of the attacker and the coordinated DSO-TSO
model are co-optimized. To enable this co-optimization,
the duality based approach [10] is used to equivalently
recast the bilevel DSO-TSO model in eq. (30)-(33) as the
following single-level problem:

oD

max
V D∪V T∪V TD
D(V D) ≤ 0
T (V T) ≤ 0
T TD(V TD) ≤ 0
oT = oTD,

(45)

(46)
(47)
(48)
(49)

where eq. (46)-(47) list the primal constraints of the dis-
tribution and transmission grid models, T TD(·) in eq. (49)

denotes the dual constraints of the transmission grid model
and eq. (49) enforces the strong duality condition by
equating the primal (oT) and dual (oT) objective functions
of the transmission grid model. Note that oD in eq. (45)
contains the bilinear product λb0(pO
), which can be

be equivalently replaced using complementarity slackness
conditions of the transmission grid model with the follow-
ing linear expression:

The linearized single-level equivalent of the DSO-TSO
model in eq. (30)-(33) and the model of the attacker in
eq. (34)-(37) constitute an equlibrium problem that can be
solved using off-the-shelf solution technique. This descrip-
tion is omitted in this paper due to the pagination limit.

V. CASE STUDY

This case study uses the modiﬁed version of the 3-area
IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) [12] for the transmis-
sion grid and the modiﬁed version of the IEEE 13-bus test
feeder [11] for the distribution grid. The transmission grid
includes 96 conventional generators, 51 load buses, 120
transmission lines, and 19 wind farms. The total demand in
the transmission grid is 8.9 GW and the total wind power
output is set to 890 MW (10% of the total demand). The
transmission line ratings are reduced to 80% of the original
values to create congestion. The root bus of the distribution
grid is connected to the transmission grid at bus #102 of
the 3-area IEEE Reliability Test System. The distribution
grid supplies the total active power demand of 36 MW and
is populated with three 5 MW gas-ﬁred generators with
the incremental fuel cost of $ 10/MWh, as displayed in
Fig. 2. The power factor at each bus is kept at 0.9. The
root bus of the distribution grid has an inﬁnite supply of
reactive power. The distribution line ﬂow limits are adjusted
to accommodate the apparent power ﬂow to serve the active
and reactive power demand at each bus with a 10% margin.

It is assumed that the circuit breakers at both ends of each
branch are set to automatically open if the apparent ﬂow
in that branch exceeds the rated value by 20%. Thus, the
power ﬂow limit at branch 0-3 is 31.5 MVA and the circuit
breaker at the root bus closes at the apparent ﬂow equal
to 34.4 MVA. Finally, we assume that the attacker can
modify the power output of IoT-controlled loads in their
full operating range.

To evaluate the socio-economic damage caused by the
attacker we measure the energy not served, i.e. interrupted
power supply (does not include line losses), and the cost it
incurs deﬁned as the product of the energy not served and
the value of lost load. The value of lost load (VOLL) is set
to $10000/MW [13].

All simulations are carried out using Julia [14] on a 2.9

GHz Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM.

A. Normal operations

During normal operations,

three gas-ﬁred generators
G1-G3 output 5 MW each and the rest of the active power
demand (36−3×5=21 MW) and active power line losses
(1.3 MW) are consumed from the transmission grid leading
to the apparent power ﬂow in branch 0-3 of 28.7 MVA.

B. Attack on the distribution grid

If the attacker intends to limit the scope of the attack
to the distribution grid, it derives the attacks strategy for
Γ = 0. Given the tree structure of the distribution grid, the
attacker would aim to disconnect the distribution grid from
the transmission grid, i.e. to open the circuit breaker at the
root bus, and/or to isolate gas-ﬁred generators by opening
circuit breakers at branches 2-3, 7-8, 8-9.
The attacker can design two strategies:
i)

Naive strategy: In this case the attacker is not aware
of the settings on each circuit breaker and, there-
fore, cannot factor in the possibility of downstream
disconnections that may in fact reduce the apparent
power ﬂow in branch 0-3.
Insidious strategy: The attacker accounts for the
effect of downstream disconnections by enforcing
limits on ∆f p
to avoid opening circuit
breakers on branches 2-3, 7-8, 8-9, while maxi-
mizing the ﬂow in branch 0-3.

ii)

Table I summarizes the socio-economic impacts of the
naive and insidious attack strategies for different penetration
levels1 of IoT-controlled loads. As the penetration level
remains low, the attacker has no effect on the distribution
grid regardless of the attack strategy chosen. However,
as the penetration level
increases, both the energy not
served and its cost gradually increases. This trend indicates
the need to develop a protection mechanism against such
attacks for future grid operations that are likely to host
more IoT-controlled loads. Furthermore, it is noteworthy the
naive strategy leads to lower socio-economic impacts. This
observation can be explained by the fact that downstream
disconnections on branches 2-3, 7-8, 8-9 isolate some of
the attacked IoT-controlled loads that reduces the ﬂow in
branch 0-3 and makes it more challenging for the attacker
to open the circuit breaker at the root bus. The attacker

1The penetration level is deﬁned as the ratio between the power of
IoT-controlled loads at every bus to the total power demand at that bus.

Fig. 2: A schematic representation of the IEEE 13-bus test feeder
[11]. The total demand of 36 MW is equally distributed between
buses #2-5,-9, 11-12. Gas-ﬁred generators with the maximum
capacity of 5 MW are installed at buses #1,6,10. The circuit
breakers at branches #2-3, 7-8 and 8-9 are closed during normal
operations.

succeeds to open the circuit breaker at the root bus and
disconnect
the transmission and distribution grids only
under the insidious strategy with the 50% penetration level
of IoT-controlled loads. Note that in the latter case three
gas-ﬁred generators located in the distribution grid cover
15 MW of the total demand.

C. Attack on the transmission grid

This attack strategy is derived for Γ = 1. In this case
the attacker aims to cause damage to the transmission grid
only and uses the distribution grid as a proxy. This attack is
possible, if the attacker avoids opening the circuit breaker at
the root bus of the distribution grid. Therefore, the attacker
uses insidious strategy strategy from Section V-B amended
with the setting of the circuit breaker at
the root bus.
Under the 10% and 25% penetration levels of the IoT-
controlled loads in the distribution grid, the attacker has
insigniﬁcant impacts on the transmission grid operations.
However, as the penetration level increases to 50%, the
attacker seriously reduces security margins2 on transmission
lines connected to bus #102, as shown in Fig. 3. Reduced
security margins do not cause socio-economic impact per
se but may trigger or contribute to line failures that in turn
may cause cascading failures [15].

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper has described a modeling framework for
analyzing the grid impacts of distributed attacks on IoT-
controlled loads. The proposed model of grid operations
accounts for both the transmission and distribution grid
operations and makes it possible to analyze a propagation
mechanism of such attacks in a bottom-up manner. The case
study has demonstrated that the socio-economic impacts of
such attacks on the distribution grid depends on the ability
of the attacker to account for the effect of circuit breakers.
Thus,
the naive attack strategy without considering the
effect of circuit breakers is shown to be less harmful than
the insidious attack strategy. The ability of the attacker to
noticeably affect transmission grid operations depends on
a penetration level of IoT-controlled loads.

2The security margin (SMl) for line l is deﬁned as SMl = F l − |f p
l |.

The paper paves the way for several enhancements that
will constitute our future work. The proposed modeling
framework needs to be extended to account for the multi-
period dynamics of power system operations and recourse
actions under attack. This extension will make it possible
to realistically evaluate the ability of the distribution and
transmission grid to withstand such attacks via post-attack
corrective actions and in presence of operational uncertain-
ties, [16]. Next, the attack propagation needs to be assessed
in a probabilistic framework. Speciﬁcally, the likelihood
of cascade failures in the transmission network needs to
be evaluated. From the perspective of the attacker, it is
important to improve the modeling accuracy of individual
IoT-controlled loads. In order to model the attack closer to
a realistic environment, our future work will explore how
publicly available grid sources can be used by the attacker
to design more harmful attack strategies.
