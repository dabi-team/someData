Abstract: Efforts have been recently made to construct ontologies for network security. The proposed ontologies are related 
to  specific  aspects  of  network  security.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  identify  the  specific  aspects  covered  by  existing 
ontologies for network security. A review and analysis of the principal issues, challenges, and the extent of progress related 
to distinct ontologies was performed. Each example was classified according to the typology of the ontologies for network 
security.  Some  aspects  include  identifying  threats,  intrusion  detection  systems  (IDS),  alerts,  attacks,  countermeasures, 
security policies, and network management tools. The research performed here proposes the use of three stages: 1. Inputs; 
2. Processing; and 3. Outputs. The analysis resulted in the introduction of new challenges and aspects that may be used as 
the basis for future research. One major issue that was discovered identifies the need to develop new ontologies that relate 
to distinct aspects of network security, thereby facilitating management tasks. 

Keywords: ontology, network security, network management, network monitoring, ontology network security

Introduction 

Computer network security has steadily become a very extensive field of research. Networking and networks 
have opened new horizons that allow us to explore beyond the boundaries of current institutions. This situation 
has led to the emergence of new threats to computerized systems. The domain of network security encompasses 
a  set  of  methods,  techniques  and  tools  responsible  for  protecting  the  resources  and  guaranteeing  the 
availability,  confidentiality,  integrity  and  the  traceability  of  information.  This  knowledge  gathered  from  the 
information security domain can be formally described by ontologies, which enables the modelling of network 
security. 

According to Gruber (1995), an ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. A conceptualization 
is an abstract and simplified view of the reality portion that interests us: objects, concepts and other units that 
exist in some area of interest and the relationships among them. Together with the benefits contributing to the 
use of complete ontologies that preserve the handling of all concepts in a specific area, this notion guides us to 
the knowledge of the existing proposals within ontological engineering, focusing on the area of network security 
and identifying the problems affecting the management of large-scale networks. From the conducted studies 
regarding ontologies in network security, those that cover certain aspects but are not aimed at solving security 
requirements,  defence  strategies,  assets,  data  integration  in  using  tools,  and  security  protocols,  which  are 
necessary for a better network management, can be identified. There have been efforts by authors focused on 
analyzing specific aspects of network security. This has identified the need to formulate a new model, a base 
ontology  that  encompasses  all  types  of  network  security  ontologies.  It  must  be  formulated  by  analyzing  the 
potentialities  of  studies  carried  out  in  the  field,  reusing  well-defined  reference  works,  overcovering  the 
shortcomings of these works, and incorporating aspects not considered for the purpose of having centralized 
information. It must also outline an improved management structure to make correct and timely decisions that 
maintain network security. 

The process in this research was  performed using the analysis of the main  identified ontologies proposed by 
Levy and Ellis (2009) to propose a comprehensive ontology.

2. Methodology 

The three suggested steps are as follows: 

1. Inputs: The literature was obtained from different databases, and research was conducted using the following 
phrase: Ontology Network Security. 

2.  Processing:  From  the  relevant  studies  acquired  in  the  literature  for  the  selected  research,  the  developed 
activities were as follows: summarize, differentiate, interpret and contrast the documents that help address the 
posed research question: what aspects have been covered by the ontologies in network security? 

3. Outputs: The  selected  articles  were classified according to their  applicability; the results of this phase  are 
shown in the following section. 

3. Literature review 

Several  research  papers  have  been  published  regarding  the  construction  of  ontologies  in  the  field  network 
security. Some efforts have focused on the development of security ontologies to prepare for threats, IDS, alerts, 
attacks, vulnerabilities, countermeasures, security policies, network management. 

Undercoffer, Joshi, and Pinkston (2003), stated the benefit of transitioning from taxonomies to ontologies and 
proposed an ontology to simulate computer attacks for sharing knowledge of intrusion detection systems.  The 
authors used DAML+OIL and DAMLJessKB to implement the ontology and present use case scenarios to illustrate 
the benefits of employing the ontology. 

Undercoffer  et  al.  (2004)  presented  an  ontology  for  computer  network  attacks  that  they  have  used  for 
distributed IDS. The authors analyzed four thousand classes of computer network attacks, and examined their 
relationships to each other and their attributes. 

Razzaq et al. (2009) presented an intelligent system with an ontological basis that analyzes the input semantically 
and is able to detect attacks with irrelevant rates of false positives. 

Gyrard, Bonnet, and Boudaoud (2013) proposed a security ontology that defines the key security concepts such 
as attacks, countermeasures, security properties, and their relation to each other. 

Gao  et  al.  (2013),  provided  an  ontology-based  attack  model,  and  then  utilized  it  to  assess  the  information 
systems' security from the attack perspective. They categorized attacks into a taxonomy convenient for security 
assessment. The proposed taxonomy consisted of five dimensions, which include attack impact, attack vector, 
attack target, vulnerability, and defense. 

Simmons, Shiva, and Simmons (2014) proposed an ontology-based problem-solving system used to identify and 
defend against cyber attacks. 

Razzaq  et  al.  (2014)  demonstrated  how  an  ontological  engineering  methodology  can  be  administered 
systematically to design and evaluate security systems. It shows a detailed ontological model that satisfies the 
broad utilization of web applications, communication protocols, and attacks. 

Si  et  al.  (2014)  constructed  a  fusion  model  comprised  of  class  keys  such  as  network  environment,  network 
vulnerability, network attack, network security incident, and sensors. In addition, they formulate three fusion 
rules that contain the aggrupation and verification of alerts and the reconstruction of attack sessions. 

Karande  and  Gupta  (2015)  proposed  an  IDS  ontological  model  that  detects  protocol-specific  attacks  and 
identifies malicious scripts. This model identifies types of attacks and vulnerabilities. 

Wang and Guo (2009) proposed an ontological approach to capture and utilize the fundamental concepts of 
information security and their function to recover vulnerability data and make inferences about the cause and 
impact said data.

Elahi,  Yu,  and  Zannone  (2009)  proposed  a  modeling  ontology  focused  on  vulnerability.  It  aimed  to  integrate 
empirical knowledge of vulnerabilities into the system development process. 

Wang and Guo (2009) examined using logic to apply semantic technology to information security with a focus 
on software vulnerability management. 

Bhandari and Gujral (2014) presented an ontological approach to perceiving the current security state of the 
network. Vulnerabilities and attacks are the main classes of taxonomy in the ontology. 

Do Amaral et al. (2006) presented a ontological structure for information security and considered a paradigm 
through which it can be used to extract knowledge from natural language texts such as information security 
standards, security policies, and security control descriptions. 

Xu  et  al.  (2008)  discussed  the  potential  of  applying  an  integration  of  ontology-based  and  policy-based 
approaches  to  automate  pervasive  network  security  management,  and  then  proposes  a  model  in  order  to 
validate the feasibility of this integrated approach. 

Cuppens-Boulahia et al. (2009) proposed an ontology based approach to present instances of security policies. 

Ramanauskaitė et al (2013) analyzed existing security ontologies by comparing their general properties, using 
OntoMetric factors with the ability to satisfy different security standards. 

Ye, Bai, and Zhang (2008) presented the design and implementation of a representation based on the knowledge 
of ontology for a distributed multi-agent peer-to-peer IDS. 

Colace,  De  Santo,  and  Ferrandino  (2012)  introduced  a  Network  Intrusion  Prevention  System  based  on 
Ontological and Slow Intelligence approach. 

Khairkar, Kshirsagar, and Kumar (2013) addressed the problems of existing IDS software. Regarding the index of 
false positives and false negatives, as well as data overloads, a proposition was proposed that included using the 
concepts of the semantic web and ontologies with the purpose of defining an approach for analyzing security 
logs in order to identify possible security issues. 

Sartakov (2015) presented an ontological representation of a network to create a specification-based IDS. 

Kyriakopoulos, Parish, and Whitley (2015) introduced a web-based tool for network management to control a 
large number of network monitoring data sources, using artificial intelligence through an intuitive user interface. 

Lannacone et al. (2015) described an ontology developed from a database of cyber security knowledge graphs. 
It is intended to provide an organized framework that incorporates information from a variety of structured and 
unstructured data sources. 

Xu, Xiao, and Wu (2009) proposed the use of a security ontology that consolidates knowledge and information 
in order to perform a contextual alert analysis and analyze in detail the problems of constructing  the security 
ontology using OWL + SWRL + OWL-S. 

Li  and  Tian  (2010)  focus  on  how  to  develop  an  intrusion  alert  correlation  system.  The  system  is  based  on  a 
hierarchical model of alert correlation knowledge and the XSWRL ontology technique. 

The majority of the articles reviewed base their proposals on a specific methodology.  In addition, they use tools 
for the construction of the ontology. The most frequently used tool is Protégé, a free, open-source ontology 
publisher and framework for building intelligent systems. 

Ye, Bai and Zhang (2008), Xu et al. (2008), Xu, Xiao and Wu (2009), Colace, De Santo and Ferrandino (2012), Si et 
al. (2014), and Razzaq et al. (2014) evaluated their proposals through test scenarios.

A large component of the proposed work includes ontologies that focus on specific aspects regardless of the 
entire network security domain. The relative percentages of the studied aspects are shown in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1: Aspects covered by ontologies 

63.33% of the ontologies make reference to attacks and their taxonomical structure. Their focus is mainly on the 
network layer missing attacks at the application layer. 

80%  of  the  papers  reviewed  do  not  present  the  results  obtained  from  test  scenarios,  and  therefore  it  is 
unachievable  to  evaluate  the  ontology  and  determine  if  it  adapts  to  the  requirements  or  to  measure  its 
effectiveness.  Only  13.33%  of  the  papers  validate  their  proposals,  trying  to  identify  the  correct  use  of  the 
language,  the  accuracy  of  the  taxonomic  structure,  the  validity  of  the  vocabulary,  and  the  adequacy  of  the 
requirements for the purpose of documenting the process of development to verify if the proposal complies 
with the terms specified. 

One of the challenges that constitutes a potentially interesting area arises when data is collected from different 
safety equipment (IDS, Intrusion prevention system, firewall, antivirus system, system security audit, honeynet, 
etc.). The safety equipment is distributed in different domains in the network, which is required to develop an 
ontology  that  can  integrate  real-time  data  from  this  safety  equipment  and  allows  the  captured  data  to  be 
properly administered. 

5. Proposal 

In Figure 2, an integral ontology is proposed that covers aspects that were not considered in prior works and 
provides an improved management to make correct and timely decisions that maintain network security. 

Figure 2: Comprehensive ontology in network security

A comprehensive ontology that covers the network security domain is suggested. It is advantageous because it 
has a formal specification,  facilitates  knowledge  sharing, and reuses the considered  aspects in the particular 
domain of knowledge. In studies concerning the ontologies, there are aspects that have not been considered 
and are part of this proposal, such as defining security strategies to mitigate the threats that may be exposed on 
a computer network; considering security requirements that are generally proposed from engineering safety, 
specific concepts and measures; protecting the assets, which can be information, hardware, or software, that 
have value to the organization and can be targeted by attackers;  having  security  protocol  that contribute to 
having a more robust infrastructure; and integrating data that support the information integration theory, which 
was proposed to describe and model how information from different sources is integrated to make an overall 
judgement, leading to a single format presentation of information provided by the network monitoring. 

6. Conclusions and future work 

A large part of the proposed ontologies are focused on covering specific aspects. Consequently, the security 
community needs an ontology that covers the entire network security domain that is flexible, adaptable, and 
facilitates  the  reuse,  communication  and  exchange  of  knowledge  by  providing  network  scalability.  This  is 
accomplished  using  mapping  techniques  to  integrate  all  of  the  specific  aspects,  focusing  on  the  general 
requirements for network security and availability, authentication, integrity and confidentiality.  

63.33% of the ontologies reviewed focused on attacks and 50% focused on vulnerabilities, which reflects the 
thinking  that  attacks  and  vulnerabilities  are  the  most  preponderant  aspects.  However,  they  neglect  other 
aspects that are included in the domain of network security. 

Only 20% evaluated their proposals in test scenarios, which allow us to discern the errors in a system before its 
implementation,  favoring  construction  through  feedback.  13.33%  validated  its  proposals  through  security 
experts. It is necessary for these mechanisms of evaluation and validation to look for more effective methods of 
analysis of ontological systems.
