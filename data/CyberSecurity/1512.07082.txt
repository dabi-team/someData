Abstract—Future power grids are fundamentally different
from current ones, both in size and in complexity; this trend
imposes challenges for situation awareness (SA) based on classical
indicators, which are usually model-based and deterministic. As
an alternative, this paper proposes a statistical indicator system
based on linear eigenvalue statistics (LESs) of large random
matrices: 1) from a data modeling viewpoint, we build, starting
from power ﬂows equations, the random matrix models (RMMs)
only using the real-time data ﬂow in a statistical manner; 2)
for a data analysis that is fully driven from RMMs, we put
forward the high-dimensional indicators, called LESs that have
some unique statistical features such as Gaussian properties; and
3) we develop a three-dimensional (3D) power-map to visualize
the system, respectively, from a high-dimensional viewpoint and
a low-dimensional one. Therefore, a statistical methodology of SA
is employed; it conducts SA with a model-free and data-driven
procedure, requiring no knowledge of system topologies, units
operation/control models, causal relationship, etc. This method-
ology has numerous advantages, such as sensitivity, universality,
speed, and ﬂexibility. In particular, its robustness against bad
data is highlighted, with potential advantages in cyber security.
The theory of big data based stability for on-line operations may
prove feasible along with this line of work, although this critical
development will be reported elsewhere.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE modern power gird is one of the most complex

engineering systems in existence; the North American
power grid is recognized as the supreme engineering achieve-
ment in the 20th century [1]. The complexity of the future’s
electrical grid is ever increasing: 1) the evolution of the grid
network, especially the expansion in size; 2) the penetra-
tion of renewable/distributed resources, ﬂexible/controllable
electronic components, or even prosumers with dual load-
generator behavior [2]; and 3) the revolution of the oper-
ation mechanism, e.g., demand-side management. Also, the
ﬁnancial, the environmental and the regulatory constrains are
pushing the electrical grid towards its stability limit.

All these driving forces demand a new prominence to the
term situation awareness (SA). The SA is essential for power
grid security; inadequate SA is identiﬁed as one of the root
causes for the largest blackout in history—the 14 August 2003
Blackout in the United States and Canada [3].

A. Main Objective and Related Researches

SA is a big topic; its time requirements are varying—from
a few milliseconds for transient procedure, several minutes
for long-time emergency of the line thermal ratings [4], to
months or even years for grid planning. This paper is mainly
concerned about short-time phenomena and timely SA with
real-time data ﬂow.

There are numerous studies about utilizing phasor measure-
ment units (PMUs) to improve wide-area monitoring, protec-
tion and control [5–7]. Data management for PMU-centric
datasets is highly demanding and critical to the future grid.
The advantage of efﬁcient, PMU-based metrics is model-free
and in real-time, without knowledge of network parameters
or topology. Based solely on PMUs data, we argue that such
an approach is well suitable for near-real-time applications.
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used in such large
systems [8]. Giri [9] points out that good advanced analytics
and a visualization framework is able to present the opera-
tor with a comprehensive, holistic portrayal of current grid
condition. Xu [10] initiates power disturbance data analytics
to explore potential applications of power quality monitoring
data; the mathematical foundations and working architectures
are not included in his work. Lim [8] proposes a voltage
stability and conditioning monitor that is model-free and in
real-time. Simpson [11] derives a closed-form condition under
which a power network is safe from voltage collapse; the
condition combines the complex structure of the network with
the reactive power demands of loads to produce a node-by-
node measure of grid stress, a prediction of the largest nodal
voltage deviation, and an estimate of the distance to collapse.

B. Contribution and Previous Work

Random Matrix Theory (RMT) tools are really underes-
timated in power girds—there are about 1,000 IEEE jour-
nals/magazines related to RMT from 2012 to 2015; most
of those are in the ﬁeld of information, communication,
signal processing. RMT can also lead to lots of fruitful
results in power systems—we have already proposed the ﬁrst
systematic architecture of RMT approach in power systems
[12], and also given some practical applications related to
the anomaly detection [12] and the correlation analysis [13].
These studies introduce the RMT to power grids and show
some unique advantages; for instance, anomaly detection using
high-dimensional indicators (e.g., MSR1 τ MSR : τMSR = τ0), is

of China (No. 51577115 and No. 61571296).

much more sensitive and effective than using classical one (e.g.
voltage magnitude on node i at time j: 0.94 < vi,j < 1.06).
They lead to a conclusion that the data-driven methodology,
rather than the model-based alternative, is more suitable for a
complex, large-scale interconnected grid with massive data.

The previous work used a relative rough statistical model
and a certain indicator, i.e. τMSR; this paper continues with the
line and gives a more concrete treatment—making full use of
the massive data in order to obtain an indicator system for the
timely SA. The core function of this indicator system is to tell
signals from noises:

• Noises: conventional incidents, e.g., sample errors, and
irregular power ﬂuctuations of small loads/generators.
• Signals: anomaly events, e.g., faults, network reconﬁgu-

rations, and dramatic power changes on some bus.

Although Ring Law and Marchenko-Pastur (M-P) Law have
already been proposed in previous two studies, they are simply
reviewed here, for the current paper to be self-contained.
Some contributions are pointed out as follows: 1) Universality
principle is needed to justify the use of RMT in engineering
systems; 2) Linear Eigenvalue Statistics (LESs)—their deﬁni-
tions, statistical features, and engineering performance metrics
against bad data2, as well as their comparison with classical
indicators—are investigated as the major contribution; 3) Ran-
dom matrix models (RMMs) and the hypothesis testing, as
the pre-requisite for conducting data-driven SA via the LES
indicator system, are introduced to tie together the physical
system measurements with data analysis tools/methods.

Fig. 1: SA for the operational decision-making [15]

In [16], SA is deﬁned as the perception of the elements
in an environment, the comprehension of their meaning, and
the projection of their status in the near future. This paper is
aimed at the use of model-free and data-driven methodology
for the comprehension of the power grid.

B. Load Behavior, Power Flow, and Voltage Stability

Power ﬂow equations deﬁne the equilibrium operating con-
dition for a synchronous power grid. Viewed abstractly, the
physical power system may be viewed as an analog power ﬂow
solution engine, taking power injection variations as inputs,
and “computing” bus voltage magnitude/phasors as outputs.

Load variations, as the inputs, can be separated into two
time scales—the fast one and the slow one [8]. Within a short
time, the fast time scale variation (time scale of seconds)
plays a dominant part; we may expect it to display small
magnitude random jump behavior, ﬁltered by the electrical
characteristics of the distribution system [17]—a load at a bulk
distribution bus aggregates the behavior of potentially millions
of individual power consuming devices, displaying on-off
behavior governed by human users or local control systems. To
model the fast time scale stochastic variation in a load, early
studies tended to employ white noise; more recent studies have
adopted Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process models [8, 18, 19]. We
choose the white noise model for this initial study.

In the power ﬂow equations, the four related parameters,

P, Q, V, and θ, obey the equations [8]:

A. Situation Awareness in Power Grids

The massive data compose the proﬁle of the actual grid—
present state; SA aims to translate the present state into
perceived state for decision-making, shown as Fig. 1 [14, 15].

model between V and P is obtained:

∆V = Ξ∆P,

with Ξ = −L−1KM.

(3)

Here, the matrix Ξ is deterministic, although unknown. The
uncertainty of the entries in Ξ is neglected for mathematical
tractability in this initial study. Even if Ξ is a random matrix,
the machinery of RMT is sufﬁcient to deal with the problem
at hand.

C. From Random Vector to Random Matrix Model (RMM)

Considering T random vectors observed at time instants i =

1, ..., T, we form a random matrix as follows

[∆V1, · · · , ∆VT ] = [Ξ1∆P1, · · · , ΞT ∆PT ] .

(4)

In an equilibrium operating system, the voltage magnitude
vector injections V with entries Vi, i = 1, · · · , N and the
phase angle vector injections θ with entries θi, i = 1, · · · , N
do not change a lot. Without dramatic topology changes, rich
statistical empirical evidence indicates that the Jacobian matrix
J keeps nearly constant, so does Ξ. Also, we can estimate the
changes of V, θ, and Ξ only with the empirical approach.
Thus we rewrite (4) as:

V = ΞN PN×T

(5)

where V = [∆V1, · · · , ∆VT ], Ξ = Ξ1 = · · · = ΞT , and
P = [∆P1, · · · , ∆PT ] . Here V and P are random matrices.
In particular, P is a random matrix with Gaussian random
variables as its entries.

where R is the standard Gaussian random matrix, i.e., its
entries ri,j are independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaus-
sian. The sample covariance matrix S is deﬁned as:

S =

XXH

For R, a special case, its sample covariance matrix is

S0 =

If signals (see I-B) exist in the system, H0 will be reject.

T
where T = ˜ΞH ˜Ξ is a non-negative Hermitian matrix; T is
deterministic and independent of S0. B, C, D, and C share
the same non-null eigenvalues [21]. We need this fact to use
Lemma II.1.

D. Hypothesis Testing for Anomaly Detection

One of the common ways to perform data-driven anomaly
detection is to employ statistical models which are usually
trained out using data from faulty and nominal behavior in a
batch mode. However, it is difﬁcult to anticipate, a priori, all
the possible ways in which failures may occur, especially when
a new vehicle model is introduced [20]. As an alternative,
based on RMM we can build the statistical models only using
sampling data and employ hypothesis testing for anomaly
together with methods/tools such as
detection. Moreover,
moving split window [12], augmented matrix [13], we design
SA functions such as fault isolation/classiﬁcation/diagnosis.

For a system described as II-C, we assume that we sample
fast enough and there are no line/unit tripping events3 oc-
curring, according to the arguments in II-B. With the above
assumptions, ∆Pi is, as a result, modeled as Gaussian random
vectors, as done in [8]. Then, as (5), the Gaussian random ma-
trix PN ×T is employed to model the system power injections,
and the corresponding V is obtained. The V is turned ˜V with
a normalization procedure in [12]. For the normalized matrix
˜V, we formulate our problem of anomaly detection in terms of

3See section I, examples of the events include changes of network topology,

dramatic increases of power demand at some bus, and so on.

Lemma II.1 (2010, [22], Section 2.4). Let Sn be the sample
covariance matrix deﬁned in (7) with i.i.d. components and let
Tn be a sequence of nonnegative deﬁnite Hermitian matrices
of size p × p. Deﬁne Bn = SnTn and assume the following.
• Entries xi,j of X are i.i.d. with mean 0 and variance 1.
• X’s sample size ratio p/n → y > 0 when n → inf.
• Tn is either deterministic or independent of Sn.
• Almost surely, the sequence Hn = F Tn of the empirical
spectral distribution (ESD) of Tn weakly converges to a
nonrandom probability measure H.

Then almost surely, F Bn weakly converges to a nonrandom
probability measure Fy,H . Moreover its Stieltjes transform
s(z) is implicitly deﬁned by the equation

(cid:90)

s (z) =

1
t (1 − y − yzs (z)) − z

dH (t) , z ∈ C+

(13)

Comparing with (10) indicates that (10) complies all the
assumptions in Lemma II.1, by noting that the entries of X
are Gaussian random variables, thus a special case of i.i.d..

The standard M-P distribution is easily recovered from (13).

In this case, Tn = Ip so that H = δ1, and (13) becomes:

s (z) =

1
1 − y − yzs (z) − z

(14)

(15)

where Σn is a nonnegative deﬁnite Hermitian matrix and Xn

the case where ϕ is an analytical function. Note that

As a result, we build the connection between large random
matrices and big data analytics. Fully driven by sampling data,
we can obtain the experimental LESs via (16). Note that the Y
in (16) is tied together with the sampling raw data V through
(6), (9), (10), and (17). We see [25] for more details about the
mathematical foundations.

III. MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS ON LARGE RANDOM
MATRICES

A. From Physical Grid to Random Matrix Model

For a power grid, there exist various parameters (e.g., fre-
quency, voltage, current, and power). Among these, we often
choose bus voltage magnitudes for further analysis. According
to (4), we can obtain a random data matrix denoted as Ωn×t
with t observations for a n-dimensional random vector.

The Ωn×t is in a high-dimensional space but not an inﬁnite
one; more explicitly, we are interested in the practical regime
for a system of n = 100–3000 nodes. Any temporal and spacial
sections can be considered in Ω, e.g., selecting T data points
from t, and N nodes from n. These data points ˆvi,j form a
matrix, denoted as ˆXN×T . Note that Ωn×t can be updated as
time goes by in a manner that the last column is the nearly
real-time data.

The ˆX is a random matrix due to the presence of ubiquitous
uncertainties in the system. Furthermore, we can convert ˆX
into a normalized matrix ˜X row-by-row:

˜xi = 1

σi(ˆxi )

(ˆxi −µi(ˆxi )),

1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) N

(18)

where ˆxi = (ˆxi,1,· · ·, ˆxi,T ). The µi denotes the mean for every
node i = 1,· · ·, N, and the σi denotes the standard deviation.
Then we can conduct RMM analysis according to II-E.

B. Random Matrix Theory (RMT)

The mathematical tools of RMT include the Ring Law, the

M-P Law, and the MSR.

4

1) Single Ring Theorem:
The Single Ring Theorem [26, 27] describes the ESD of
a large generic matrix with prescribed singular values, i.e.
an N ×N matrix of the form A = U1ΥU2, with U1 and
U2 some independent Haar-distributed unitary matrices and
Υ a deterministic matrix whose singular values are the ones
prescribed.

2) Marchenko-Pastur Law (M-P Law):

In II-C, we show
that the ESD follows the generalized M-P distribution and
satisﬁes the condition of being compactly supported limit
measure. As a result, the Single Ring Theorem says that the
empirical distribution is a single ring on the complex plane.

Lemma III.1 (Marchenko-Pastur Law, 1967, [28]). Assume a
N ×T random matrix X obeys condition4 C1 with C0 ≥ 4,
N/T = c ∈ (0, 1], the ESD of
and N, T → ∞ such that
lim
N→∞
the matrix S deﬁned in (7) converges in distribution to the
M-P Law with a density function:

where a± = σ2(1 ±

c)2.

, a− (cid:54) λ (cid:54) a+
, otherwise

(19)

For the special case of i.i.d., see III-B4.
3) Universality Principle:
This principle [29] enables us to obtain the exact asymptotic
distributions of various test statistics without restrictive distri-
butional assumptions of matrix entries [30]. For a real system,
we cannot expect the matrix entries to follow i.i.d. distribution.
One can perform various hypothesis tests under the assumption
that the matrix entries are not Gaussian distributed but use
the same test statistics as in the Gaussian case. Numerous
studies using both simulations and experiments demonstrate
that the Ring Law and the M-P Law are universally valid—
the asymptotic results are remarkably accurate for relatively
moderate matrix sizes such as tens [12]. This is the very reason
why RMT can handle practical massive systems.
4) Independent Identically Distributed Case:
For a rectangular N ×T random matrix X, the entries are

i.i.d. variables, satisfying

E(Xi,j ) = 0, E(Xi,j Xm,n) = δi,mδj,nσ2

(20)

where δ is the Kronecker Delta Function deﬁned as

δα,β =

(cid:40)

1 α = β
0 α (cid:54)= β.

For the normalized data matrix ˜X obtained as (18), accord-

ing to [31], we deﬁne its singular value equivalent as

(cid:113)

H
˜X ˜X

Xu =

U, U ∈ CN×N is a Haar unitary matrix.

Then, for L independent matrices Xu,i, we consider their

product

Z = (cid:81)L

i=1Xu,i.

4The matrix ensemble is said to obey condition C1 with constant C0 if
the random variables Xi,j are jointly independently, having zero mean and
variance one, and obey the moment condition sup
i,j

E|Xi,j |C0 ≤ C.

The product Z is converted into ˜Z as

√

˜zi = zi /(

N σi(zi)),

1 (cid:54) i (cid:54) N

where zi = (zi,1, · · · , zi,N ). Based on (??) and (19), the ESD
of ˜Z converges almost surely to the same limit given by [32]

ρring(λ) =

as N, T → ∞ with the ratio c = N/T ∈ (0, 1].

5) Mean Spectral Radius (MSR):
The geometrically motivated MSR is a statistic that is a
complicated function of collected data vectors; it may also be
viewed as a certain LES, as deﬁned in (16). For any matrix,
such as ˜Z, we can obtain its eigenvalues λi( ˜Z), i = 1, ..., N on
the complex plane. The mean value of all these eigenvalues’
radii is denoted as τMSR :

B. LES Designs and the Theoretical Values

where N is typically large, say in the order of 100 − 3000.
The large value of N has a far-reaching effect. That is the
reason why the Gaussian properties of such LESs as τMSR may
be justiﬁed [22, 25]. The facts are analogues of the CLTs in
classical probability.

IV. LINEAR EIGENVALUE STATISTICS OF LARGE RANDOM
MATRICES

A. Linear Eigenvalue Statistics

1) Deﬁnition:
The LES τ of an arbitrary matrix Γ ∈ CN×N is deﬁned via

the continuous test function ϕ : C → C. [23, 33]

τ (ϕ, Γ) = NN [ϕ] = (cid:80)N

i=1ϕ(λi) = Trϕ (Γ)

(23)

where the trace of the function of a random matrix is involved.
It is very interesting to study the special case for a Gaussian
random matrix. For power grids, the universality principle is
extremely relevant in this context.
2) Law of Large Numbers:
The law of Large Numbers tells us that N −1NN [ϕ] con-

verges in probability to the limit
(cid:90)

lim
N→∞

1
N NN [ϕ] =

ϕ(λ)ρ(λ) dλ

(24)

where ρ(λ) is the probability density function of λ.

3) Central Limit Theorem of LES:
The CLT [23, 33–38], as the natural second step, aims
to study the LES ﬂuctuations. Consider another form of
covariance matrix:

A typical scenario is assumed to obtain the theoretical

values: N = 118, T = 240, and c = N/T = 0.4917.

1) LES for Ring Law:
The MSR deﬁned as (22) is in a special form of a LES.
Since λi((cid:101)Z), i = 1, ..., N are highly correlated random vari-
ables; each one is a complicated function of the raw random
matrices ˆX, and thus τMSR itself is a random variable, the sum
of dependant random variables divided by the total number.
The self-averaging property [25] with a large matrix size N
is remarkable. According to (21) and (24), the theoretical
expectation of the random variable τMSR, as N → ∞,
approaches asymptotically the limit:

E(τMSR )= (cid:82)(cid:82)
= (cid:82) 2π
0

Area ρring(r)×r·r drdθ

(28)

In practice, we can use this asymptotic limit to replace the true
value (unknown) for a ﬁnite value of N, when N is sufﬁciently
large.

Similarly, for a rectangular data matrix Γ, according to (23),
we can obtain various LESs τ (ϕ, Γ) via designing different
test functions, as well as their theoretical values. Here we list
some classical test functions:

2. Chebyshev Polynomials (T3): ϕ(x) = 4x3 − 3x
3. Chebyshev Polynomials (T4): ϕ(x) = 8x4 − 8x2 + 1
4. Generalized variance or determinant (DET): ϕ(x) =

ln(x)

The CLT for M is given as follows [33]:

5. Likelihood-ratio test (LRT): ϕ(x) = x − ln(x) − 1

With the previous work [12], the τMSR-t curve is obtained,
as illustrated in Fig. 2, to conduct anomaly detection. The
τMSR starts the dramatic changes at the instants t = 801 s and
t = 1378 s; these are right the beginning for the event of step-
change and voltage collapse, respectively.

C. LES Indicator and Classical One

The methodology of SA based on a class of LESs, including
technical route, concrete procedures, evaluation system, and
advantages over classical one, is another meaningful topic.
Here, we do not expand on this and just show the character-
istics from the indicator perspective.

According to IV-B, numerous LESs are able to be designed
for a ceratin RMM X. With these LESs, the high-dimensional
indicator system is built; it gives us a multiple view angle to
gain insight into the system—the test function is similar to
a ﬁlter in some sense. Table II lists the features of the LES
indicator and makes a comparison with the classical one.

in Table II,

As pointed out

the LES indicator system
provides a much better way, compared to the classical one,
to utilize the massive data for a complex system. The relation
of the former to the later, in some sense, is just like that of
the quantum physics5 to the classical one. Instead of accurate
measurements and descriptions (for the mass, position, veloc-
ity, etc), the later gives probabilistic statistics. By comparing
the experimental values (always fully data-driven) with ideal
theoretical values (guaranteed by theorems), the complicated
system is understood statistically.

In short, with the help of RMT, we can investigate a data-
driven methodology, based on which we can turn the real
power grid into RMMs, using measurements such as PMUs.
With a pure mathematical procedure, a class of statistical
indicators is formed as a new epistemology for the grid. Some
advantages of this epistemology—such as data-driven and
model-free, speed, reasonableness, sensitivity—have already
been shown in our previous work [12, 13]; we will show its
ﬂexibility and robustness against bad data in the Section V.

V. FUNCTIONS DESIGN WITH LES AND RELATED CASES
For the background, we adopt IEEE 118-bus system with 6
partitions [12] (Fig. 8). The SA functions, anomaly detection
and fault diagnosis, and correlation analysis based on MSR,
have already been designed in our previous work [12] and [13]
respectively. This paper pushes the design forward.

A. SA based on Theoretical Exception

We assume the events as shown in Table III; the ﬁnal result
is illustrated as the solid blue line in Fig. 2. According to
III-A, we obtain a data source ΩV : ˆvi,j ∈ R118×1600 for N =
118 nodes with T = 1600 time instants. Noting that the grid
ﬂuctuations are set by γAcc and γMul as [12]

˜yload nt = yload nt × (1 + γMul ×r1) + γAcc ×r2
where r1 and r2 are standard Gaussian random variable.

physics; it is unreasonably effective and still inﬂuences and puzzles us deeply
nowadays [39].

1) LES Designs and Static Stability Evaluation:
Keep N = 118 and T = 240. According to IV-B, numerous
LESs τ are designed and they empirically converge in the
distribution to the Gaussian variables with means E(τ ) and
variances D(τ ). These theoretical values are able to be ob-
tained via a similar statistical process to (28), (29), (30), and
(31), and are shown in E0 part of Table IV.

On the other side, the experimental LESs at each time
instant t, denoted as τϕ(t), are obtained via a fully data driven
procedure, in turn, as (18), (25) and (23). Duration a stage,
we acquire τϕ(t1),· · ·, τϕ(tk), and then, their statistics—Mean
µ(τ ) and Variance σ(τ ). Table IV is mainly such an illustration
of these statistics for the given case. Taking the raw data about
voltage magnitude as an example, following steps are needed
as the preprocess:
• We can set

the step
the data-processing interval,
between τϕ(tj) and τϕ(tj+1), to a single sampling time
point (i.e. ∆tDP = 1) to conduct one-by-one moving split-
window analysis, or to T points (i.e. ∆tDP = T ) to make
τϕ(t1),· · ·, τϕ(tk) independent6 on the time series.

i.e.

• There exist, in a system, numerous P V nodes and V θ
nodes whose voltage magnitudes keep constant and will
there are also some small
lead to a singular matrix;
signals, causing by input noises, needed to be ﬁltered.
Therefore, we add a small random ﬂuctuation; the signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) is set as 0.002 experientially, i.e.,
vij = vij+0.002r, where r is a Gaussian random variable.

• The normalization is introduced as (18).
Above steps will change the theoretical variation to some
value, denoted as D1(τ ); D1(τ ) is able to be obtained in
advance by simulations using the ideal inputs, i.e., standard
random matrix X118×240, with the same data preprocessing.

Suppose the sampling frequency is high enough and the
∆tDP = T . Thus, for a constant state, such as E1: no
ﬂuctuations around 18 MW, we can obtain more than 40

E3 parts show these experimental statistics; sorted by the
deviations of the means from its theoretical predictions, it goes
that E1 < E2 < E3.

2) LES System Performance for SA in this Case:
Back to the assumed scenes, according to the anomaly
source PBus-52 and window size T , we divide the temporal
space into 7 stages: S1–S7, shown as Fig. 2. Parts S1–S7
in Table IV show the performance of the designed LESs.
Roughly speaking, sorted by the means they are arranged as
S1 < S2 < S3 < S5 < S6 << S4 << S7, and by the
variances as max(S1, S3, S5) << S2 << S4 << S6 << S7.
We summarize the performance of the LES system in SA:
a). The LES system is effective for stability evaluation. By
comparing the deviation between the experimental value and
the theoretical/empirical value for different system operating
periods (E1 < E2 < E3), it come to a conclusion that the more
steady the system is, the less the deviation becomes.
b). When the system is under equilibrium operating situations
without anomaly events occurring (E1, E2, E3), its LESs τ
follow a Gaussian distribution,7 which in turn validates the
theories in (16).
c). The RMMs and LESs are able to be linked to some novel
models, such as the matrix-valued Brownian Movement. It is
another topic and we will not expand here.
d). Different test functions ϕ(λ) have different characteristics
and effectiveness;
the signal may be sensitive to some
test functions but not others. A test function is akin to a
ﬁlter in some sense. Hence, we can balance the reliability
and sensitivity for the detection in a special circumstance.
Moreover, beyond beneﬁting anomaly detection (aiming to
distinguish signals from noises), the test functions give us
much more selections to handle the complicate situation and
have the potential to trace a speciﬁc anomaly (aiming to
distinguish the mixed signals).
e). Low cv means high precision and repeatability of the
assay [40]; from the aspect of cv, MSR performs best.
Especially, for a special purpose, e.g. the lowest cv or the
lowest bias, there exists an optimal combination of Chebyshev
Polynomials for the test function.

B. Other LES Functions and the Visualization

We can also utilize LESs to implement some other concrete
functions, e.g., fault diagnosis. By introducing the augmented
matrix (A = [B; C]) which consists of the basic status data
(B) and the factor data (C), our previous work [13] conducts
the correlation analysis with the LESs of A and B. It is a
feasible data-driven approach to ﬁnd out the causing factor of
the anomaly with no knowledge in advance.

The LES is a statistical indicator; its value depends on a
large number of sample data points ˆxi,j in the form of the
entries of the matrix ˆX. It means that LES τ is universal
with the least assumptions and robust against individual bad
data. Then, a case is designed to validate the robustness.
Furthermore, the case also gives the visualization of the system
from LES indicator perspective; meanwhile, a comparison
with perspective of low-dimensional indicator, e.g., raw data
ˆV, is made.

We keep the assumed scenario in Table III, and take τLRF
as the test function. We obtain a local µ0 = τLRF/E(τLRF) for
each region in a similar way to that of the whole system (118
nodes); thus, the µ0-t curves are plotted as Fig. 3. The division
depends on the speciﬁc network structure; however, a potential
problem lies here: how small the partition (Fig. 8) can be that
keeps the theories still work. To ﬁnd the answer we should
study how to turn big data into tiny data [41]; it is another
topic and we do not expand here.

Fig. 3: µ0-t Curve for Single Partitioning: A1–A6

With an interpolation method [42], a 3D power map is plot-
ted as the illustration of µ0; then the animation is produced.
Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 depict some key frames of the animation
about LES indicator µ0, whereas Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 about raw
data ˆV. From Fig. 3 and the animation, we obtain:
a) In Fig 4, at t = 801 s, µ0 of A3 area changes dramatically
and keeps for T sampling points. The duration T is observed
in the animation; it is also reﬂected by Fig. 3. Therefore, we
deduce that some event occurs in A3; even we can go further
that the event is a regional one and inﬂuential to A1, A2,
A4, A5, and has little impact on A6. These conjectures, in a
reasonable way, coincide with the common sense that there is
a sudden load change in A3 at t = 801 s as we assumed in
Table III.
b) With sustainable growth of PBus-52,
the whole system
becomes more and more vulnerable. The vulnerability, before

8

the system has a breakdown due to voltage collapse, can be
estimated in advance via the animation of µ0.
c) Subﬁgures of (c), (d), (e) are almost the same for Fig. 7, but
not for Fig. 6; the animation demonstrates this phenomenon
more clearly. That means, even with the most related data
(data of A3) losses which will lead to an insufﬁcient SA using
ˆV, the proper judgements can still be achieved by µ0.
d) In this way, the interconnected grid is decoupled naturally.
We can conduct regional SA only with its own datasets; these
datasets are relatively independent.

VI. CONCLUSION

This paper, motivated for the future’s electrical grid, stud-
ies the situation awareness (SA) based on linear eigen-
value statistics (LESs). Three ingredients are essential for
the data-driven SA: 1) data modeling—building the random
matrix model (RMM) for a certain physical problem and
employing the RMM to connect
the sampling data with
statistical theories/tools; 2) data analytics—conducting high-
dimensional analysis to obtain the statistical indicators LESs;
3) interpretation—interpreting and visualizing the indicators
to gain insight into the system.

For engineering applications, based on the experimental
LESs which are fully derived from the sampling data, various
SA functions are studied; for example, by comparing the
LESs with their theoretical prediction, the anomaly detection
is conducted. In addition, the 3D power-map animation is
developed for the visualization.

Future research directions include: (1) Model validation
with different
implementations of the grid, ranging from
statistic, dynamic and real-world systems; (2) Data fusion with
a number of random data matrices, using mathematical tools
such as free probability; (3) The use of Gaussian random
matrices in replacement for general data matrices that are
obtained from the electrical grid. The universality principle
of random matrix theory says that this replacement causes
negligible errors. (4) The convergence rate of the central limit
theorem, using the Berry-Essen type of inequalities [25], is
used to study how fast the number of the data nodes (such as
PMUs) converges to the limit.
