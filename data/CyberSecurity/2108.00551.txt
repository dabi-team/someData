Abstract—Cyber defense is reactive and slow. On average, the
time-to-remedy is hundreds of times larger than the time-to-
compromise. In response to the expanding ever-more-complex
threat landscape, Digital Twins (DTs) and particularly Human
Digital Twins (HDTs) offer the capability of running massive
simulations across multiple knowledge domains. Simulated re-
sults may offer insights into adversaries’ behaviors and tactics,
resulting in better proactive cyber-defense strategies. For the
ﬁrst time, this paper solidiﬁes the vision of DTs and HDTs for
cybersecurity via the Cybonto conceptual framework proposal.
The paper also contributes the Cybonto ontology,
formally
documenting 108 constructs and thousands of cognitive-related
paths based on 20 time-tested psychology theories. Finally, the
paper applied 20 network centrality algorithms in analyzing the
108 constructs. The identiﬁed top 10 constructs call for extensions
of current digital cognitive architectures in preparation for the
DT future.

I. INTRODUCTION

Humans are recognized to be the weakest link in the cy-
bersecurity defense chain [1], [2]. Insider threat incidents cost
both small and large companies billions of dollars annually [3].
Cyber defenders are reactive and slow. On average, hackers
need 15 hours to compromise a system while defenders need
200 to 300 days to discover a breach [2]. Meanwhile, the
cybersecurity threat landscape keeps expanding. Cyber de-
fenders respond by enlisting inter-discipline knowledge from
numerous ﬁelds such as math, psychology, and criminology
[4], [5], [6], [2]. In such a climate, Digital Twins (DTs) and
incredibly Human Digital Twins (HDTs) offer the capability
of running large-scale simulations across multiple knowledge
domains to improve proactive cyber-defense strategies.

Digital Twins are computational models of physical sys-
tems, including humans. The DT market is rapidly growing at
a compound annual rate of 45.4% [7]. Notably, massive DT
projects such as the British National Digital Twin [8] are being
built. Within the intertwined DT networks, individual smart
DTs such as HDTs should be capable of not only executing
mimetic behaviors but also having local and global awareness,
self-learning, and self-optimizing [7].

For the ﬁrst time, this paper proposes a grounded vision on
how DTs and HDTs can be applied towards cybersecurity. The

main goal is making a case for expanding current digital cog-
nitive architectures that will be at the hearts of future HDTs.
The paper uniﬁed twenty most cybersecurity-relevant ﬁnalists
from over seventy behavioral psychology theories. The theory-
informed knowledge and other cybersecurity constructs were
then encoded as the novel Cybonto ontology. Analyzing the
Cybonto ontology informed the Cybonto conceptual frame-
work.

The key contributions are as followed. The Cybonto concep-
tual framework solidiﬁes the vision of how human cognitive
digital twins and digital twin systems can be leveraged to
design proactive cybersecurity strategies. The Cybonto ontol-
ogy provides research-based guidance on 108 constructs and
thousands of possible paths among them. Analyzing the on-
tology’s cognitive core using more than 20 network centrality
algorithms yields Behavior, Arousal, Goals, Perception, Self-
efﬁcacy, Circumstances, Evaluating, Behavior-Controlabiity,
Knowledge, and Intentional Modality as the top 10 most
inﬂuential constructs. These results call for the expansion
of current cognitive architectures to better ﬁt
their future
employments in DT systems.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW

The concept of HDTs previously appeared in human-
computer interaction studies. In comparison with traditional
models, HDTs for digital twin systems have broader scopes
with emphasis on both behavioral and cognitive activities.
The work of Somers et al. is an excellent example in which
HDT acts as a sensible personal assistant in organizing social
events [9]. Notably, the HDT did not explicitly ask potential
event participants for their preferences. Instead, it observed
the people’s social dimensions and then modeled the cognitive
processes underlying an expert event planner’s decisions.

Zhang et al. [10] describes HDTs’ self-awareness as a con-
tinuous process that involves dynamic knowledge acquisition
and utilization. Numerous feedback loops will be needed.
Well-designed ontologies are essential for information ex-
changes among different models [11], [12]. Compared with an
application ontology, a reference ontology is supposed to be
much more canonical and reusable [13]. Ontological reusabil-
ity begins with the adoption of a top-level ontology. Key
papers in cognitive frameworks and cybersecurity ontologies
are as followed.

 
 
 
 
 
 
A. Cognitive Frameworks

ACT-R [14] is representative of the psychological modeling
group with Clarion and Epic as other members. SOAR [15]
is representative of the agent functionality-focused group that
also includes Sigma, Lida, Icarus, and Companions. ACT-
R and SOAR differ on architectural constraints, memory re-
trieval, conﬂict resolution strategies, and exhaustive processing
[16]. ACT-R sequential architecture forces developers to watch
out for bottlenecks while SOAR’s parallel architecture is
more relaxed [16]. ACT-R provides two options for resolving
conﬂicts, while SOAR offers none.

Both SOAR and ACT-R share the same general cognitive
cycle and common architectural modules such as perception,
short-term memory, declarative learning, declarative long-term
memory, procedural long-term memory, procedural learning,
action selection, and action. While ACT-R, SOAR, and other
cognitive systems rely on symbolic input/output and rule
database, their symbols may contain statistical metadata, and
their architectures do allow the integration of deep learning
systems.

B. Cybersecurity Ontologies

Ontologies are essential for symbolic operations, the build-
ing of a knowledge base, and explainability. Ontologies can
be manually build from scratch [17], [18] or be automatically
extracted [19], [20]. DOLCE1 vs. BFO2 highlights the im-
portance of ontological commitments. DOLCE is grounded in
natural language while BFO is grounded in the real world [21].
Because objects can be conceptual or actual in a language-
based ontology, there is always a risk of one actual object
being recognized as two or more different conceptual objects.
Oltramari et al. [22] introduced Cratelo, which has DOLCE
as the top-level ontology. The ontology’s human behavioral
structures are conﬁned within the cyber operation scope. Costa
et al. [23] used the natural language processing approach in
building their Insider Threat Indicator Ontology (ITIO). The
ontology inherited considerable amounts of language ambigu-
ity and did not support the identiﬁcation of deeper behavioral
structures. In 2019, Greitzer et al. [24] built upon their 2016’s
work and introduced the Sociotechnical and Organizational
Factors for Insider Threat (SOFIT). Due to the absence of
a top-level ontology and the behavioral language that leans
heavily towards organizational insider threat activities, SOFIT
is an application ontology rather than a reference ontology.
Greitzer et al. [24] also admitted that ontology validation
exercises only covered 10% of the ontology.

Meanwhile, Donalds and Osei-Bryson [25] reported that cy-
bersecurity ontologies have been insufﬁcient due to fragmen-
tation, incompatibility, and inconsistent use of terminologies.
The team proposed a cybercrime classiﬁcation ontology struc-
tured around attack events [25]. While the ontology provides a
holistic, multi-perspective view regarding cybercrime attacks,

1https://lnkd.in/gTFR8Wt
2https://basic-formal-ontology.org/

its behavioral components are limited and lack theoretical
grounding.

C. Open Problems

While massive DT projects are underway, digital cognitive
twin development is pale in comparison, and HDT for cy-
bersecurity is non-existent. This paper examined both ACT-
R and SOAR published research repositories and found no
cybersecurity dedicated track with topics such as cyberse-
curity, online ethical decisions, cyber criminology, or cyber
attack/defense simulations. There is no grounded vision on
how powerful DT systems with HDTs may improve proactive
cybersecurity defenses. Recommended exploring questions are
(i) What are the types of HDT (malicious hackers, groups as
single HDT, defenders,etc.) to be built? (ii) What will HDT for
cybersecurity feedback loops look like? (iii) How will existing
cognitive architectures be extended to best facilitate those
feedback loops? (iv) What shall we learn from our continuous
observation of those HDTs?

Current cybersecurity-related cognitive models focus on
narrow use cases and are far from the HDTs that can auto-
matically interact with other DTs while building up their own
awareness. For the main reason, existing cognitive architec-
tures do not provide enough granularity. This leads to further
problems with multi-modal understanding and meta-cognition.
For example, current long-term memory architecture can be
further divided into experiences and beliefs. It is possible
for two persons sharing a strong belief to have different
interpretations of the same data. One may be signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by a past experience. Additionally, having access to
too much data due to lack of granularity will lead to cognitive
bottlenecks at system levels. Deciding which chunks of data to
be loaded, excluded or be permanently erased from memory
remains a challenge.

Finally, we do not have a reference ontology for document-
ing and sharing behavioral-cybersecurity knowledge. Existing
cybersecurity ontologies that have behavioral components are
mostly application ontologies with none or weak ontological
commitments. Such ontologies will not ﬁt for use in massive
and complex DT systems.

III. THE CYBONTO CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The novel Cybonto conceptual framework aims to provide
general directions on answering the previously-mentioned
questions regarding the vision of DTs and HDTs for cyber-
security. The framework targets the cognitive process of a
malicious actor as an HDT within a DT system. Cognitive
space is deﬁned by the behavioral/cognitive component of the
Cybonto ontology. The action space is limited by the HDT’s
set of encoded actions, its ability to improvise new moves, and
the other DTs’ interaction interfaces. In the beginning, ﬁfty
theories were picked from the behavioral/cognitive psychology
body of knowledge. Each theory was ranked based on its
ability to generate research, relevancy to cybersecurity and
criminology, and consistency. Table I presents the top 25
theories.

Fig. 1. Conbonto Conceptual Framework

Fig. 2. Conbonto Ontology - Behavioral/Cognitive’s Horizontal Relationships Visualized

Then, each theory was codiﬁed into tuples of (entity, ”in-
ﬂuence” relationship, entity). The combination of 20 codiﬁed
top theories formed the Cybonto cognitive core ontology with
over 100 constructs. Full description of Cybonto in RDF
store, Neo4J relational database, and other documentation are
available at Cybonto-1.0 Github repository 3. The Cybonto
conceptual framework was formed upon analysis of the Cy-
bonto ontology. Figure 1 presents the Cybonto conceptual
framework with three environment types and four groups of
digital twins (DTs).

The internal environment (INE) is private to each DT. It
contains both cognitive components and non-cognitive com-
ponents. Opposite to the internal environment is the societal
environment (SOE) where everything is public. In between, the
in-group environment (IGE) connects INE with SOE. All envi-
ronments follow Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological System Theory
[26] which describes inﬂuences as progressive, varying, and
reciprocal forces among individuals and environments. For
example, a seemingly distant public event may still be able
to affect certain private mental processes.

The IEG and the SOE are relative to the targeted HDT.
The IEG is equivalent to Bronfenbrenner’s micro- and meso-
systems. The microsystem is the most inﬂuential external envi-
ronment with members such as family, close friends, school,
lovers, and mentors. SOE is equivalent to Bronfenbrenner’s

3https://github.com/Cybonto/CYBONTO-1.0

Exo-, Macro-, and Chrono-systems. The Cybonto conceptual
framework requires four representatives from four DT groups.
We need one attacker HDT and one defender HDT. Unlike
traditional models to which data and feature speciﬁcations
were explicitly fed, an attacker HDT must collect the data by
itself. Group-related data cannot be inferred if the fundamental
group structure is not met. Hence, we then need at least two
more DTs to present IEG and SOE identities.

An HDT can perform two main types of behaviors: the ar-
tifact creating/altering behavior and the non-artifact behavior.
An artifact can range from a piece of code to a complex non-
cognitive digital twin. Viewing a malware’s codes is a non-
artifact behavior, while running the codes can be an artifact-
altering behavior if the codes make changes to other artifacts.
The perceptual layer sits on the border between the internal
and external environments (IEG and SOE). Different percep-
tual layers in combination with different cognitive systems will
have different perceptions of the same data streams. Reﬁned
perceptions constitute only a small part of a digital cognitive
system. The Cybonto ontology details thousands of cognitive
paths for processing initial perceptions. The result of a cog-
nitive processing chain will be either a non-artifact behavior
or an artifact creating/altering behavior. The behaviors (data
streams) will be observed by other HDTs, and a new round of
feedback loops begins. It is essential to note that a behavior
can be kept secret within the in-group environment.

In this framework: (a) HDTs have the complete freedom

to interact with other DTs per published protocols, and au-
tomatically seek whatever data is made available to them.
(b) By releasing their behaviors, HDTs generate new data,
which may then be consumed by other HDTs. (c) The cog-
nitive architecture within each HDT determines its cognitive
capabilities which should include awareness and adaptation.
(d) Cybonto DT simulation’s objectives should be more about
discovering new knowledge (the Why and How) rather than
mining speciﬁc data (the What).

IV. ANALYSIS OF THE CYBONTO ONTOLOGY

Cybonto elected the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as its
top-level ontology from more than thirty candidates. BFO
is the only top-level ontology that adopts materialism, com-
mits to actual-world possibilia, and has an intensional crite-
rion of identity. The Cybonto Core (the behavioral/cognitive
component) is grounded further by employing the Mental
Functioning (MF) as its mid-level ontology. MF follows best
practices outlined by the OBO Foundry and aligns with other
projects in the Cognitive Atlas - a state-of-the-art collaborative
knowledge-base in Cognitive Science [27].

Materialism views the world as a collection of materialized
objects existing in space and time [21] - a core principle
in DT strategies. Committing to materialism through BFO
offers a fundamental distinction in the way Cybonto represents
mental constructs. For centuries, cognitive activities were
considered abstract particulars that could only be described
through languages. This tradition is the reason why most be-
havioral components in cybersecurity ontologies are language-
based. Recent breakthroughs in the brain-machine interface
such as those of Neuralink [28] enables measurements of
brain activities that correspond to certain cognitive constructs.
Therefore, it is now possible to ground behavioral/cognitive
ontologies in materialism. Cybonto rejects conceptual objects,
different linguistic descriptions of the same actual objects,
process-based objects, and qualitative object labels that cannot
be measured in real life.

Figure 2 shows the network of Cybonto’s horizontal rela-
tionships. Each node size equals the log scale of the node’s
page rank. A darker link color indicates a higher link value.
Nodes were automatically arranged in a multi-circle layout
with higher betweenness centrality nodes closer to the center.
Figure 3 shows the most popular entities based on different
network centrality scores.

Top Authority Central (AC) constructs receive inﬂuence
from constructs that have the most inﬂuence on others. Top
Betweenness Central (BC) constructs are the ones that sit in
the shortest paths among other constructs. BC constructs can
serve either as bridges or gatekeepers of other constructs and
processes. Top Eigenvector Central (EC) constructs are the
leaders of their own cliques. A clique is a group of constructs
in which each member has relationships with the others. In the
context of the cognitive digital twin, a clique may represent
a strong cognitive/behavioral pattern. Not only the top EC
constructs are well-connected with their own clique members,
they also have relationships with other cliques.

Fig. 3. Most Inﬂuential Constructs Based on Six Types of Centralities

Contribution Centrality is Eigenvector Centrality on inverse-
Jaccard weighted values of the input networks. A link between
two constructs has the most contribution weight when the
neighbors of one end are most different from the neighbors
at the other end. Top Out-degree Central (OC) constructs
have the most out-links (inﬂuencing) to others while top In-
coming Central (IC) constructs are inﬂuenced by the most
important in-coming neighbors. The top PageRank constructs
have relationships (whether in-coming or out-going) with the
most inﬂuential neighbors.

The top 10 constructs across 20 network centrality measures
are Behavior, Arousal, Goals, Perception, Self-efﬁcacy, Cir-
cumstances, Evaluating, Behavior-Controlabiity, Knowledge,
and Intentional Modality. In this list, only Behaviors, Goals,
Perception, Evaluating and Knowledge are parts of existing
digital cognitive architectures, although some are not explicitly
implemented. It is possible that before this study, inﬂuential
cognitive structures have been studied per independent use-
cases and thus could not collectively attract attention from
conservative cognitive system designers. Now with a bird-eye
view across 20 behavioral theories, these top 10 constructs
deserve better attention.

Within cognitive architectures, we may consider implement-
ing Goals, Knowledge, Perception, and Evaluating explicitly
and with ﬁner granularity. For example, Perception is more
than short-lived sensory perception. For example, Alice per-
ceived Bob as a nice guy, and such perception persists whether
Bob is with Alice or not. Additionally, we should consider
adding Arousal and Intentional Modality. Although Arousal
is a non-cognitive construct, it is ranked in the second place
and inﬂuences several cognitive constructs within the top 10,
such as Evaluating and Intentional Modality. Unfortunately,
the current state of research regarding Arousal as a part of a
digital cognitive process is almost non-existent. SOAR-related
research results show a few papers studying the effects of
general emotions. ACT-R research repository shows just four
papers studying the effects of Arousal on memory manage-
ment.

The Circumstance is another non-cognitive construct with
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on behavioral outcomes. The paper rec-

ommends expanding the existing Mental Image module in
existing cognitive architectures to include non-physical envi-
ronment variables such as urgency, group dynamics, and social
sentiments. Finally, the paper recommends a new component
- Imagining - to enable the HDT to run its own situational
simulations and reason about possible circumstances.

V. CONCLUSION

Once massive non-cognitive digital

twin systems are
brought online, adding human cognitive digital twins will be
the only logical next step. The vision of letting human digital
twins run free in a digital twin world (and observing them)
is realistic and offers a new paradigm in knowledge mining.
The Cybonto conceptual framework demonstrates how such
an ecosystem can be leveraged for shaping proactive cyber-
security defense strategies. Notably, HDTs are fundamentally
different from deep learning models. Most cognitive systems
can combine human cognitive reasoning (symbolic) with deep
learning models (sub-symbolic). Cognitive reasoning with
good enough granularity and a well-designed ontology allows
us to observe and more importantly,
to understand what
the digital twins are doing. Hence, the paper also proposes
the Cybonto ontology as speciﬁc recommendations on how
existing cognitive systems can be expanded. Future work
may involve further framework development, ﬁne-tuning and
expanding the ontology, and building a malicious HDT for
