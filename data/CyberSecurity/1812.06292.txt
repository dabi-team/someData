Abstract  

Deep learning is an advanced model of traditional machine learning. This has the 
capability  to  extract  optimal  feature  representation  from  raw  input  samples.  This 
has  been  applied  towards  various  use  cases  in  cyber  security  such  as  intrusion 
detection,  malware  classification,  android  malware  detection,  spam  and  phishing 
detection  and  binary  analysis.  This  paper  outlines  the  survey  of  all  the  works 
related  to  deep  learning  based  solutions  for  various  cyber  security  use  cases. 
Keywords:  Deep  learning,  intrusion  detection,  malware  detection,  Android 
malware detection, spam & phishing detection, traffic analysis, binary analysis. 

1 Introduction 

Cyber security involves protective key data and devices from cyber threats. It’s a 
vital  part  of  corporations  that  collect  and maintain  large  databases  of  client  data, 
social  platforms  wherever  personal  information  were  submitted  and  also  the 
government  organizations  wherever  secret,  political  and  defense  information 
comes into measure. It helps in protecting against vulnerable attacks that possess 
threat  to  special  data,  might  or  not  across  numerous  applications,  networks  and 
devices. With the quantity of individuals accessing the information online which is 
increasing daily and also the threats to the data are increasing, with the cost of on-
line crimes calculable in billions. Cyber security is that the set of technologies and 
processes designed to shield computers, networks, programs, and data from attack, 
unauthorized  access,  change,  or  destruction.  These  systems  are  composed  of 
network security and host security systems, every of those has a minimum firewall, 
antivirus  computer  code,  associated  an  intrusion  detection  system  (IDS).  This 
survey  summarizes  the  importance  of  cyber  security  using  Deep  learning 
techniques  (DL).  Deep  learning  technique  is  been  employed  by  researchers  in 
recent days. Deep learning may be used along side the prevailing automation ways 

like rule and heuristics based mostly and machine learning techniques. This study 
helps  is  understand  the  advantage  of  deep  learning  algorithms  to  classify  and 
correlate  malicious  activities  that  perceived  from  the  varied  sources  like  DNS, 
email,  URLs  etc.  Not  like  ancient  machine  learning  approaches,  deep  learning 
algorithms don’t follow any feature engineering and have illustration ways. They 
will extract best options by  themselves.  Still,  further  domain  level  options got to 
outline  for  deep  learning  ways  in  information  science  tasks.  The  cyber  security 
events thought-about during this study are enclosed by texts. To convert text to real 
valued vectors, numerous linguistic communication process and text mining ways 
are incorporated along with deep learning. 

2 Shared tasks 

In recent days, to enhance the system performance, shared task is organized as part 
of the conferences. In this shared task initially the train data set will be distributed 
among the participants and the train model will be evaluated on the test data set. 
This is most familiar in NLP domain recently shared task on identifying phishing 
email has been organized by [46] . The details of the submitted runs are available 
in [47]. Followed by shared task on detecting malicious domain organized by [48] 
as part of SSCC’18 and ICACCI’18. These two shared tasks allowed participants 
to share their approach through working notes or system description paper. Yearly 
there is one more shared task conducted by CDMC. But they don’t have an option 
to submit system description papers. But this year (2018) they are giving an option 
to submit system description papers (CDMC 2018). 

One  significant  issue  was  that  the  most  of  the  publically  available  data  sets  are 
very  old  and  each  data  set  has  their  own  limitations.  To  overcome  such  issues  a 
brief  study  made  to  understand  the  need  of  Security  domain,  datasets  and  key 
feature of data sciences is discussed in [1] for problems employing the data science 
towards cyber security. 

3. Use-cases in cyber security 

3.1. Intrusion detection 

An intrusion detection system (IDS) has been developed that’s capable of detection 
every  kind  of  network  attacks  within  the  environments.  IDS  detect  malicious 

network activities by analyzing the collected packets, alarms to computer user, and 
blocks  attack  connections  from  attacks  [2].  It  additionally  connects  with  the 
firewall  as  an  elementary  technology  for  network  security.  The  characteristics  of 
network  is  been  assessed  into  Host  based  intrusion  detection  (HIDS)  which 
involves  in  putting  package  and  monitors  internal  packets  of  the  system.  To 
perform  intrusion  detection  HIDS  gathers  data  from  its  system  calls,  OS  audit 
trails,  application  logs,  etc.  Network  based  intrusion  detection  which  detects  the 
malicious activity in network traffic. Generally, intrusion detection algorithms unit 
classified  into  2  methods:  misuse  detection  (Signature  based)  and  anomaly 
detection. Signature based IDS: It is a technique looks a series of bytes or sequence 
with malicious network and helps in track down the detail log of the system which 
cause  false  alarm.  Anomaly  based  IDS:  It  helps  in identifying  the  anomalies  and 
indicates serious and rare events overt the system and rectifies the unusual traffic 
pattern  in  a  network.  To  resolve  the  disadvantage  of  these  two  detection  method 
Hybrid  IDS  has  been  proposed  which  combines  the  complexity  of  anomaly  and 
issue  detection  system  and  gets  with  new  framework.  Now-a-days,  self-learning 
system  becomes  one  of  the  prominent  methods.  Machine  learning  is  one  of  the 
powerful concepts. Most of the ML solutions resulted in achieving the high false 
positive  rate  and  high  machine  computation.  This  is  due  to  most  of  machine 
learning techniques comes with the learning patterns among small-scale, low-level 
feature  patterns  of  traditional  and  attack  connections  records.  Most  notably 
machine  learning  comes  with  deep  learning  which  will  be  outlined  as  a  better 
model  of  machine  learning  algorithms.  These  will  help  in  learning  the 
representation techniques with high advanced hierarchic sequence. In [3] proposed 
a model for novel deep learning approach in NIDS operation over networks, with 
combination  of  deep  and  shallow  learning  methods.  This  helps  in  analysis  of 
network traffic over non symmetric deep auto encoder technique (NDAE). In [4], 
[5],  [6]  a  brief  study  explains  that  Long  short  term  memory(LSTM),  Recurrent 
neural  network(RNN),  Convolution  neural  network(CNN)  performs  well  in  IDS 
systems when compared to other machine learning algorithms. CNN with n-gram 
technique  is  briefly  discussed  along  with  hybrid  network  such  as  CNN,  CNN-
recurrent  neural  network 
short-term  memory 
(CNNLSTM)  and  CNN-gated  recurrent  unit  (GRU).These  techniques  helps  in 
identification of good  and  bad network  ID  in network connections.  CNN has  the 
capacity to gain high level feature representation from low level feature sets during 

(CNN-RNN),  CNN-long 

extraction process is disused in [4]. Following with [5], [7] system call modeling 
based  approach  with  ensemble  method  is  proposed  using  LSTM  algorithm  for 
anomaly  based  IDS  system.  System  call  modeling  helps  in  capture  of  semantic 
meaning of every call and relation over the network. Ensemble methods focus on 
false alarm rate which fits IDS design. This is a compact method, which helps in 
storage  of  parameters  in  a  small  space.  This  method  is  considered  as  fast  and 
efficient  approach  in  sequential  matrix  application.  Application  of  deep  neural 
networks is leveraged for intrusion detection by [52]. Recently, [54] discussed the 
various security issues in autonomous vehicles. 

3.2. Malware detection 

Malwares are programs which disrupts the data, files in the system which reduces 
the vulnerability and performance. In some cases it will lead to total corruption of 
system or a server [8]. These are easily passed through various environments using 
unauthorized software tools. There is existing some works in which deep learning 
has become one of the prominent methods in malware analysis [9]. In [10] binary 
and multiclassifier techniques are used for classification which gives better result 
when processed with rectified linear unit activation functions and dropout over the 
hidden  networks.  In  [8],  [11]  deep  learning  approach  applied  with  four  layer 
network  design  is  discussed.  To  get  modest  computation  feature  text  extraction 
techniques  such  as  Byte/Entropy  Histogram  Features,  PE  Import  Features,  String 
2D  histogram  features;  PE  Metadata  Features  can  be  used.  A  brief  discussion  is 
made to show how to prevent overfitting and how backpropagation method helps 
in  speeding  up  the  learning  process  over  the  network.  In  [12],  [9]  echo  state 
networks  (ESNs)  and  recurrent  neural  networks  (RNNs)  helps  in  extracting  full 
information  by  random  temporal  projection  technique.  Max  pooling  is  used  for 
non-linear sampling of data and logistic regression for final classification of data. 
In [13], discussed  an advances malware technique known as Ransomware. It is a 
kind of crypto viral extortion which helps encrypt the files and gather information 
without  other  knowledge.  In  [14],  [13]  deep  learning  algorithm  LSTM  is  been 
applied  on  API  calls  by  binary  sequence classification  method.  In  [51]  evaluated 
the performance of classical machine learning classifiers and deep neural networks 
on malware detection. 

3.3. Android malware detection 

Android  device  has  becoming  a  popular  nowadays  among  peoples.  Malware 
detection becomes a big challenge in android platform. Deep learning along with 
NLP  comes  with  a  great  breakthrough  in  this  area  [15],  [16]  Droid  detector  is  a 
Google app helps in collect malware data. The collected data is processed for both 
static and dynamic analysis for feature extraction and it is characterized by DBN 
based  approach.  In  [17]  comes  up  with  semantic  information  extraction  from 
system  call  sequence  method  using  NLP  which  helps  in  construction  of  deep 
learning  model.  LSTM  model  is  constructed  with  effective  number  of  hidden 
layers  to  achieve  better  result.  Time  cost  function  is  used  for  classification  by 
implementing  different  framework  like  Tensorflow  [49]  to  speed  up  the  process. 
This model is been compared with n-gram model which is considered as superior 
detection  method  in  android  malware.  Hyper  parametric  tuning  is  been  done  in 
LSTM  network,  LSTM-RNN  network  topology  explains  how  the  architecture 
helps in get better result [18].[19], [20]. The effectiveness of the API call sequence 
is  been  studied,  To  perform  this  CNN  is  been  approached  by  discussing  the 
training  size  and  sequence  length  which  gives  better  indication  in  false  and 
negative positive. 

3.4.  Detection  and  categorization  of  domain  names  generated  by  Domain 
name generation algorithms (DGAs) 

fluxing  malwares  are  possessed 

Domain 
through  domain  generation 
algorithm(DGA).These  malwares  encodes  through  domain  or  IP  address  by 
blocking the network from further communication to server and the host [21]. The 
detailed  study  on  DNS  log  collection  and  deep  learning  for  detecting  malicious 
domain names in large scale is discussed in [22], [65]. In [23] explains DNS logs 
in  side  LAN  environment  which  use  deep  learning  algorithms  for  detection  of 
malicious  domain  names  and  compared  with  the  traditional  machine  learning 
algorithm.  They  claimed  that  the  deep  learning  algorithms  performed  well  in 
comparison  to  the  traditional  machine  learning  algorithms  and  moreover  these 
algorithms  remain  as  robust  in  an  adversarial  environment.  In  [24]  describes  a 
detail  study  on  statistical  feature  approach  on  DGA  systems  by  splitting  the 
features into domain length, domain level using n-gram technique. In this approach 
Hidden  markov  model  (HMM)  is  been  used  for  classification.  These  traditional 
techniques  are very  slow  and poor in  the performance  of  false  and  true  positives 
[25], [26]. [27] Deep learning technique helps in discrimination of DGA domains 

from non DGA domains. In [28] focused mainly on Character based method using 
neural networks such as RNN, CNN and Hybrid CNN. In RNN Endgame model is 
used  which  improves  the  model  performance  by  adding  dropout  to  overcome 
dropout  during  training  phase  along  with  embedding  technique.  To  get  a  better 
predictive  accuracy  CMU  model  is  implemented  along  with  Bidirectional  RNN 
[29].  The  NYU  and  Invincea  models  are  discussed  with  CNN  and  hybrid 
architecture of CNN is explained along with MIT model. All this models consists 
of  multiple  layers  and  are  termed  as  most  extensive  architectures.  In  [30],  [31] 
LSTM  network  comes  up  with  an  advantage  of  featureless  extraction  of  raw 
domain names as an input is also discussed. In [50] proposed a unique framework 
which  correlated  the  data’s  of  DNS,  URL  and  Email  to  increase  malicious 
activities detection rate.  

3.5. Spam and phishing detection 

document 

frequency 

The study shows that the spam email is the act of sending undesirable information 
or mass information in a substantial amount to some email accounts. It is a part of 
electronic  spam  including  almost  indistinguishable  messages  sent  to  different 
beneficiaries  by  email.  Along  with  phishing  other  cyber-crime  technique  scams 
other  personal  information  such  as  passwords,  credit  card  details,  bank  accounts 
etc.  These  problems  are  rectified  using  deep  leaning  techniques  with  Natural 
language processing (NLP). In [32] represented the phishing techniques over mail 
using  unbalanced  dataset.  Mainly  in  this  various  techniques  such  as  term 
frequency-inverse 
(TF-IDF),  Nonnegative  Matrix 
Factorization  (NMF),  bag  of  words  are  discussed  for  feature  extraction  and  also 
algorithms  such  as  Random  forest(RF),  logistic  regression,  k-nearest  neighbor, 
Multi  nominal  navies  Bayes  are  used.  In  which  LR  and  MLB  comes  with  high 
metric  performance.  In  [33]  neural  network  approach  is  discussed  by  applying 
pearl script for feature extraction which helps to get dataset in a vector format. A 
comparative  study  is  done  on  the  extracted  dataset  using  Traditional  machine 
learning  algorithms  in  which  Decision  tree  (DT),  and  neural  network  approach 
performed  well.  In  [34]  discussed  about  the  NLP  feature  extraction  techniques 
using  methods  such  as  character  level  embedding  and  word  embedding.  A 
comparative study is made among Support vector machine (SVM) using character 
level  and  CNN  using  both  character  and  word  embedding  techniques.  In  which 
CNN  using  word  embedding  gives  a  better  result.  In  [35]  showed  a  new  LSTM 

approach  in  which  dataset  are  considered  as  a  hierarchical  email  architecture  by 
considering it as sentences and words. Bidirectional LSTM is used for both cases 
which helps in compute the weight and estimates the phishing probability over the 
data  during  the  network  computation.  In  [36]  neural  network  is  used  for 
classification  of  URL  phishing  it  consists  of  three  layer  linear  network  which 
makes the topology very light and compact. Malicious threat over URL’s is been 
analyzed  by  character  sequence.  Embedding  technique  is  used  with  RNN  and 
hybrid  CNN  networks  which helps  in studying how  to develop  a shelter  for  web 
page content analysis from malicious URL’s with faster web page response. In [53] 
the application of CNN is leverage for image spam detection. In [55] discussed the 
application  of  CNN  and  CNN-LSTM  for  phishing  URL  detection  and  compared 
with  bi-gram  text  representation.  Recently,  a  shared  task  on  phishing  email 
detection  was  organized  as  part  of  CODASPY’18  conference  and  the  detailed 
information is discussed in [56-64]. 

3.6. Traffic Analysis 

In [37] the density and the volume of internet traffic is been increasing day by day. 
Identification of data flow through the network is considered as a major problem in 
traffic analysis. In [38] discuss traditional method using Artificial neural network 
and  deep  learning  methods  and  result  shows  that  in  feature  learning,  unknown 
protocol identification this approach very well but it could give better adaptation in 
non-automation  method  in  traditional  method.  Deep  packet  framework  for 
extracting features automatically form network traffic using Deep learning method 
is  proposed  in  [17]  these  packets  help  in  handle  sophisticated  task  like  multi 
challenging,  traffics  etc.  In  [39],  [40]  proposed  an  architecture  for  Shallow  and 
deep  network  for  secure  shell  protocol.  In  [41]  which  RNN  network  helps  to 
classify and model the tunnel SSH by modeling the time series feature to identify 
statistical information of the traffic flow. 

3.7. Binary Analysis 

Binary analysis is a powerful security analysis tool which looks into binary codes 
and  finds  the  vulnerability  issues  with  uncertainty  deploying  in  free  and  open 
software.  Static  analysis  can  understand  the  pattern  of  the  code  to  find 
vulnerabilities.  Now-a-days  automated  analysis  method  is  combined  with  deep 

learning  method  which  has  overcome  the  pattern  based  limitations  [42].  In  [43] 
discussed about that different problems faced in binary analysis and how it can be 
solved  using  neural  networks.  Many  benchmark  approaches  are  analyzed  with 
RNN,  LSTM  and  GRU  networks.  To  rectify  Gradient  descent  over  the  hidden 
layers, optimization is done with rmsprop method. This is also been discussed with 
background  behind  all  networks  with  time  function,  error  analysis,  function 
identification and limitation of network. In [44] also came with RNN network but 
in this work so many experiments are performed on machine code snippets. These 
snippets  are  performed  on  LLVM  and  MIPS  binaries  data  using  tokenization 
scheme. These helps in extraction of higher level structure from lower level binary 
structure.  In  [45]  presents  a  new  system  EKLAVYA  which  helps  in  recovering 
function  type  signatures  from  disassembled  binary  codes  using  RNN  network. 
Argument recovery module on RNN is implemented using techniques like saliency 
mapping  and  sanitization.  This  system  helps  in  learn  calling  conventions  and 
idioms with high level accuracy parameter. In [42] discussed deep learning method 
on  assembly  codes  which  help  to  analysis  the  software  weakness.  In  this  Text-
CNN is been analyzed using Instruction2vec and word2vec which has given high 
accuracy in classification of text data.  

4. Conclusion 

Deep learning is a prominent algorithm employed in  several cyber security areas. 
Considering  several  traditional  methods  and  machine  learning  methods  deep 
learning algorithms considered as a robust way to solve problems. From this study 
it is clear that most of the deep learning algorithms comes up with better accuracy 
rate,  which  will  be  helpful  in  building  an  real  time  application  for  analyzing 
malicious activities over network.
