Modern electric power grid, known as the Smart Grid, has fast transformed the isolated and centrally controlled
power system to a fast and massively connected cyber-physical system that benefits from the revolutions
happening in the communications and the fast adoption of Internet of Things devices. While the synergy of a
vast number of cyber-physical entities has allowed the Smart Grid to be much more effective and sustainable
in meeting the growing global energy challenges, it has also brought with it a large number of vulnerabilities
resulting in breaches of data integrity, confidentiality and availability. False data injection (FDI) appears to be
among the most critical cyberattacks and has been a focal point interest for both research and industry. To
this end, this paper presents a comprehensive review in the recent advances of the defence countermeasures
of the FDI attacks in the Smart Grid infrastructure. Relevant existing literature are evaluated and compared in
terms of their theoretical and practical significance to the Smart Grid cybersecurity. In conclusion, a range of
technical limitations of existing false data attack detection researches are identified, and a number of future
research directions are recommended.

CCS Concepts: • Smart Grid → cybersecurity; cyberattack; false data injection.

1 INTRODUCTION

E NERGY is the backbone of our economic growth and is a super-critical resource on which all

other national critical infrastructure sectors rely upon. Significant rise in threats to critical
infrastructure from nation states and malicious actors poses real challenges in the understanding
of operational vulnerabilities in a Smart Grid as well as the different attack vectors that may
jeopardize the stability and efficiency of the power system. The 2020 Global Risks report by the
World Economic Forum [115] indicates that large scale cyberattacks against critical infrastructure
and networks is the top most threat and will continue to be among the most likely global threats
over the next 10 years.

Fig. 1. Number of ICS vulnerabilities by year (reproduced from the US ICS-CERT [45] and Kaspersky ICS-CERT
[12])

According to vulnerability reports from the US ICS-CERT [45] and Kaspersky ICS-CERT [12], the
energy sector has reported the largest number of vulnerabilities among all critical infrastructures.
For example, Fig. 1 shows the number of vulnerabilities of various Industrial Control System (ICS)
elements between 2010 and 2019 [45] [12]. Accordingly, 178, 110, and 283 cyberattack incidents were
recorded in the energy sector out of 322, 415, and 509 ICS cyberattack incidents, respectively across
the fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019. These cyber incidents may lead to myriads of security risks
including the loss of critical data necessary for control operations, malicious modification/deletion of
critical power system states. Possible consequences include incorrect customer billing information,
price manipulation in the energy market, small to large scale electric power outage, and the
likelihood of endangering lives by limiting power to other national critical infrastructures.

This paper discusses various state-of-the-art false data injection (FDI) [76] defence countermea-

sures in Smart Grid.

1.1 Purpose and Scope of the Study
Bad data detection (BDD) [34] [140] [37] has been widely utilized in the power system control
centers for the identification of cyber anomalies. Nevertheless, it has been proven that the BDDs
are incapable of detecting FDI [76] attacks. The extensive studies on potential FDI attacks have
enabled Smart Grid operators to set up a range of defence mechanisms. The primary objective of
this article is to provide a systematic literature review and insights into a taxonomy of various
defence countermeasures against cyber-physical attacks in cyber-physical system.

1.2 Contributions
This article has analyzed related and recent publications and reference materials in the mitigation
techniques of the false data attacks across various domains of the Smart Grid infrastructure. We
systematically search for older and more recent related literature, analyse the main findings covered
in each literature, critically evaluate them, and compare each solution within the broader conception

2 RELATED SURVEY PAPERS
The work by Z Guan et. al [35] is one of the earliest works where authors present a comprehensive
survey of attack and defence of the FDI. [35] has overviewed detection schemes and presented on
the basis of centralised-and distributed-based SE techniques. Furthermore, a survey research of
the data injection attacks with respect to three major cybersecurity aspects, namely FDI attack
construction, impacts of the attacks, and countermeasures is studied by R Deng et. al [21]. Unlike
to previous studies, [21] thoroughly studied the impacts of data injection attacks on the electricity
market. Another line of survey research is studied in [74], which summarises related literature
on different attack models, economic impact of the attack, and mitigation techniques for various
Smart Grid domains including transmission, distribution, and microgrid networks. Moreover, G

economic impacts of the attacks, and countermeasures in Smart Grid. Research works in [119] and
[131] also comprehensively discuss the FDI attacks from the attacker’s and operator’s point of view
along with the consequential impacts of the attacks.

Different from previous surveys the authors of [87] reviewed two main classes of detection
algorithms: model-based and data-driven, and have discussed the benefits and drawbacks of each
technique. As compared to other review works which mostly focus on the energy management
system (EMS), the authors in [86] discussed FDI attacks on various entities of the online power
system security. These authors review and compare studies on the FDI attacks and provide a
new class of cyber-oriented countermeasure: prevention (further classified into block chain and
cryptography based techniques).

Unlike to the related works, this paper presents a detailed survey of recent developments in
the FDI and sets out a taxonomy of the incumbent cyberattack with respect to defence strategies
across every Smart Grid domain including transmission to consumption, AGC to microgrids/DERs,
substation to wide area monitoring systems. IoT, cognitive radios, and software-defined networks
have recently been introduced as enablers to the Smart Grid. These communication technologies
are very important to address the cybersecurity aspects of today’s Smart Grid which were missed in
most of the existing related works. In general, in light of research, this paper provides an in-depth
survey of the latest advances of the defence measures against the cyber-physical FDI attacks within
the Smart Grid infrastructure. Table 1 summarises the comparison of existing survey papers and
this article.

3 BACKGROUND
Smart Grid is the convergence of various cyber and physical components of the electrical power
domain. In other words, it is an evolution of the electrical power system that is co-engineered
through expertise from different fields such as OT (namely physical power devices, data acquisitions,
control systems, and industrial automation), IT (namely decision making and human interfaces),
advanced ICT infrastructure, and cybersceurity to be more effective and sustainable in meeting
the growing global energy challenges. As compared to the traditional power grid, Smart Grid
provides an end-to-end system of two-way electricity flow in which customers cannot only utilize
energy but can also feed energy back into the grid. Smart Grid also supports wide variety of energy
sources (including the renewables which are key to low-carbon emissions). According to NIST’s
[93] conceptual model, Smart Grid comprises of seven seven interconnected application domains:
generation, transmission, distribution, customer, market, service provider, and operator.

While applications in every Smart Grid domain are critical to the scalability, efficiency and
stability of the power system operations, they also introduce vulnerabilities to the Smart Grid. The
probability of a successful breach is inevitable for all cyber-physical systems directly or indirectly
linked to the Smart Grid. Hence, it is crucial to scrutinize the relations between the physical model
and the cyber system in order to provide a resilient cyber and communications infrastructure in
the Smart Grid environment. Therefore, in this section, we briefly discuss the main cyber-physical
elements of the Smart Grid.

3.1 SCADA
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) [92] [113] is an industrial and power system
control application. Usually a SCADA consists basically of three subsystems: a data acquisition sub-
system that collects measurement of the power system, a supervisory sub-system that has the ability
to control remote intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) [92] by transmitting control commands (such
as to close/open a circuit breaker, to change a transformer tap settings, to lower/raise generator
output, and etc), and a communication sub-system that interconnects the data acquisition sub-
system to the supervisory sub-system. A typical scenario in the integrated SCADA system can be
described, for example, when the SCADA gathers data from diverse IEDs in a power system through
various communication methods (such as IP-based wide area networks, local area networks, and
software-defined networking), and then control/monitor the data using different visualisation tools.

3.2 Energy Management System
Power system operations are regulated by system operators from the control center. Within the
control center lies EMS, an automation system used to monitor, control, coordinate, and optimize
energy data performance across the majority of Smart Grid infrastructure in real time. EMS depends
on a SCADA system for its data monitoring and analysis events. Distribution grids (usually from
substation to consumption-side) are controlled via the distribution energy management (DEM)
system.

A typical EMS comprises the following functional elements including state estimation (SE),
optimal power flow, contingency analysis (CA), alarm management system, planning and operations,
automatic generation control and economic dispatch. Generally, a physical power grid can be
considered as a set of buses, transmission lines, loads, generators, shunt components, and etc. Each
of the buses or nodes are physically interconnected by lines or branches. Fig. 21 is a typical Smart
Grid architecture using IEEE 5-bus2 system. It illustrates how the EMS and other ICT components
communicate with the physical power grid.

3.3 Smart Grid Communication Systems
Communication systems are essential to the efficient operation of the Smart Grid. Various com-
munication technologies are utilised across the different domains. For example, IEC 61850 in
substation automation system (SAS), PMU in wide area monitoring systems (WAMS), AMIs across
customer-side, and NCS between sensors, actuators and controllers.

3.4 Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)
DERs are decentralised, versatile, and modular architecture that incorporate a number of renewable
sources, including solar, wind, geothermal, etc. Compared to conventional approaches in which
energy is generated by centralised and big power plants, DER now allows energy production and
delivery from many areas, including millions of homes and businesses. Microgrid technology is one
of the enablers of Smart Grid that provides smooth collaboration between DERs offering isolation
options (also known as ’islanding’) or access to the conventional grid electricity.

4 CYBER-PHYSICAL SECURITY OF SMART GRID
The security issues of Smart Grid have emerged from both physical and cyber spaces that include:
physical security [93] (i.e. security policies with respect to staffs or personnel, physical equipment
protection, and contingency analysis), cybersecurity (focusing on the information security of Smart
Grid pertaining to IT, OT, network and communication systems), and cyber-physical security (in-
corporating strength in all physical and cybersecurity measures against inadvertent cyber-physical
incidents within an integrated Smart Grid framework). In this section, Smart Grid cybersecurity
goals, cybersecurity requirements, and cyber-physical attacks are highlighted.

4.1 Smart Grid Cybersecurity Goals
Quality of service and secure power supply are the primary concern of power companies and
industrial sectors. So much that the Smart Grid strives to build a much more efficient and reliable
energy, cybersecurity threats can inevitably slow down its progress. Therefore, the Smart Grid needs

system. An intruder can compromise the power measurements, mislead outcome of the EMS, induce abnormality in the
power system operation, and can lead to power outage.

systems using 5 buses and 17 sensors, accounting for the nodal power injections and line power flows.

to ensure the basic security goals such as data integrity, availability confidentiality, accountability,
and etc of the various cyber-physical elements. While these security principles have been developed
to govern policies on generic information security within organisations, the principles of Smart
Grid cybersecurity have also been identified by NIST [93].

Avaiablity: The permanent availability and timeliness of electricity are crucial in our day to
day life. Within the Smart Grid environment, availability is by far the most critical security goal for
stability of the power grid. It ensures reliable access to and timely use of information. Availability
can be quantified in terms of latency, the time required for data to be transmitted across the power
grid. Smart Grid cybersecurity solutions should provide acceptable latency thresholds of various
applications by minimising detrimental effects on the availability.

Integrity: Integrity is the second yet highly critical Smart Grid security requirement. As part
of the cybersecurity objectives, integrity ensures that data should not be altered without autho-
rized access, source of data need to be verified, the time stamp linked with the data must be
identified/validated, and quality of service is under acceptable range.

Confidentiality: From the point of view of system reliability, confidentiality seems to be the
least important as compared to availability and integrity. Nevertheless, with the proliferation of
smart meters and AMIs across the Smart Grid implies the increasing importance of confidentiality
to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information, and to preserve customer privacy or proprietary
information.

Accountability: Another security objective within the Smart Grid ecosystem is accountability,
a requirement that consumers should be responsible for the actions they take. Accountability is
very important, particularly when customers obtain their billing information from the utility center,
they will have sufficient evidence to prove the total power load that they have used.

4.2 Smart Grid Security Requirements
The dynamics of the cyber-physical interaction in the Smart Grid poses extrinsic system dependen-
cies. Further, the open inter-connectivity of Smart Gird with the Internet brings various security
challenges. Therefore, Smart Grid requires stringent holistic security solutions to uphold the secu-
rity objectives discussed above and to provide salient features within the Smart Grid infrastructure.
First of all, the security solutions need to be robust enough to counteract against increasing security
breaches that can lead to loss of data availability, loss of data integrity, loss of data confidentiality.
In other words, the operation of power system should continue 24/7 regardless of cyber incident
maintaining the power grid reliability (consistent to the data availability and to almost 99.9%
[93] of data integrity across the power system), and ensure consumer privacy. Second, resilient
cyber-physical operations are required. According to NIST’s recommendation [11], cybersecurity
in critical infrastructure such as the Smart Grid can adopt a comprehensive security framework
containing five main features. These include identifying of risks or cyber incidents, providing
protective mechanisms against the impact of a potential cybersecurity event, providing defence
mechanisms to allow prompt discovery of security breaches, appropriate response to minimise the
effect of the incident, and recovery plans to restore any systems that have been disrupted due to
cyber accidents. Moreover, as attacks from cyber criminals on the power grid continue to rise in
complexity and frequency, it is inevitable that various parts of the Smart Grid are vulnerable to the
incumbent attacks. Therefore, it is required to provide strong attack defence across the EMS and to
deploy secure communication protocols.

5 FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACKS
FDI attack is one of the most critical malicious cyberattacks in the power system. This class of attack
was first suggested by Liu et al.[76], in which the power system SE outputs are compromised by

deliberately orchestrated injection of bad data into metre measurements. The theoretical frameworks
for false data attacks are discussed in this section.

5.1 Stealthy FDI Attack
In a typical control center after SE is conducted, BDD techniques are employed to identify any
injected bad data by computing residual vectors in terms of ℓ2-norm3 between the original measure-
ments y and the estimated measurements ˆy = Hˆx, given by ||r||2
2. However, research
[76] proved that BDDs are vulnerable to FDI anomalies. The outstanding feature of false data
attacks is the residual vectors of the SE drop below the BDD’s threshold despite the presence of
maliciously corrupted measurements. Consequently, such strategically constructed false data attack
vectors can bypass (i.e. remain stealthy in) the traditional BDD algorithms.

2 = ||y − Hˆx||2

FDI Attack Construction and Proof of Stealthiness. In the presence of FDI attack, the adver-
5.1.1
sary’s goal is to introduce an attack vector a into the measurements without being noticed by the
operator. Adversaries approach with different FDI attack strategies whereby the final effect of the
malicious data results in compromising state variables across the power system domain. Generally,
there are two main FDI anomaly construction strategies, one that requires knowledge of power
system topology, and the other is based on a data-driven approach also known as the blind FDI
attack strategy. Here, we use the former approach to demonstrate the stealthiness of the FDI attack.
Let a = [𝑎1, 𝑎2, ..., 𝑎𝑚]𝑇 denotes the FDI attack, then measurements that contain this malicious data
are represented by y𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 = y + a, and ˆx𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒 = ˆx + b refers to the estimated state vector after the
FDI attack, where b = [𝑏1, 𝑏2, ..., 𝑏𝑛]𝑇 is the estimated error vector injected by the adversary. It is
usually assumed [76] that the attack vector a can be formulated as a linear combination of H given
by a = Hb.

It has been proven [76] that if ||r||2

< 𝜏 for some detection
threshold 𝜏. Hence, under a = Hb the malicious measurement vector can pass the traditional BDD
algorithms.

< 𝜏 it also holds true that ||rfalse||2

Sparsity of FDI Attack. Usually a is assumed as a linear combination of the columns of H
5.1.2
[76]. However, the adversary’s control can be limited to only over a few measurement devices. It
could be because either the system has secure measurement devices which the attacker cannot
access, or the attacker has limited physical access to the devices. This results in a sparse FDI
attack [76] [5] [95]. FDI attack designed with only few non-zero components is called sparse attack
and only small number of devices (let us say 𝑘) are required to launch the attack. Let the attack
A = (a, k) contains the attack vector a and 𝑘 sets of compromised meters. Then, the sparse attack
[76] [5] with ||a||0 ≤ 𝑘 can be defined as ℓ0-norm minimization problem [95] and can be given as

5.2 Requirements for Stealthy FDI attacks
The requirements of FDI attacks are different from one application domain to the other. For instance,
in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the inherent wireless communication and broadcast channels
among the nodes render more vulnerability to adversaries that may eavesdrop on all traffic, inject
bad data reports containing erroneous sensor readings, or can even deplete the already limited
energy capacity of sensor nodes [108]. In contrast, in the power system, it is difficult for an intruder
to access the network parameters, hence, require more intelligent approach to launch a successful

attack. In general, the FDI attacks create strong requirements from both the perspectives of the
attackers and the system operators. The following are some of the main requirements for the FDI
attacks under the cyber-physical Smart Grid environment.

5.2.1 Rendering power system unobservability [76]. Through the injection of false data an adversary
can hijack and compromise the power system measurements which further results in the system
unobservability. Typically, the attacker can remain undetectable at the control center while resulting
in incorrect decisions of the state estimator. Even if the cyberattack can be detected by the SE, part
of the power network may become unobservable where the SE cannot determine the system states.

5.2.2 Partial-Parameter-Information. Earlier studies on the FDI attack models are based on the
premise that the adversaries are capable of getting complete information of the power system
topology. Authors in [101] presented that it is also possible to construct stealthy attacks based on
partial network information. However, attacks based on partial information require to satisfy the
observability criteria. Another research direction ensures that the stealthiness (i.e. undetectability)
of FDI attacks can also be modeled through data-driven or other partial-parameter-information
approaches.

5.2.3 Minimal Attack Vectors. For many reasons, the adversary’s control can be limited to only
over a few measurement devices. For this reason, stealthy FDI attacks should be designed with a
very small attack magnitude and with only few non-zero components (i.e. attack sparsity) [76] [5].
Consequently, the attacker is required to compromise just smallest set of devices to cause network
unobervability.

5.2.4 Attack Specificity. Whatever the motives of the cyber criminal are, the strategy behind the
attack may be either indiscriminate or targeted. The scope and impact of these two adversarial
approaches are different. The indiscriminate attack may not require specific knowledge of the
cyber-physical devices but launched arbitrarily against random Smart Grid elements. On the other
hand, the targeted one can require a sophisticated approach which can be launched against targeted
nodes.

5.2.5 Requirement on The Influence of The Attack. Attackers can approach in various ways to
launch a successful attack and to cause a security risk on the Smart Grid. Some attackers want
to exploit the data collected from sensors and networked devices across the power system. They
may intend to exploit the weaknesses of sensors and communication protocols and launch the
attack vector. Some typical examples of attack scenarios can be attack against sensor measurements
(tampering power system parameter values in remote terminal units (RTUs) and PMUs). Another
example can be by leveraging the communication protocols, where remote tripping injection can be
performed by adversaries. In addition, attackers can infiltrate AMI-based communications networks
in order to tamper with the contents of customer data that can result in disorder of the SE and other
EMS functionalities. Others may intend to directly falsify the outcome of the state estimators [76].

5.2.6 Requirement Based on Security Violations. Some FDI-based malicious attackers try to infringe
data availability, some violate data integrity, and others go against data confidentiality.

(a) Loss of data integrity: For example, by injecting a systematically generated false data, a
cyber intruder may compromise the integrity of the SE by hijacking a subset of metres and
returning a modified data. The modification may involve deletion of data from the original
meter readings, addition of bad data to sensor readings, or alteration of values in the hijacked
measurements. The majority of FDI attacks, including, but not limited to, [76] [5] [33] [126]
are based on this type of security violation.

(b) Loss of data availability: Furthermore, FDI attack can compromise the availability of critical
information that is either intended to disrupt the power system or to stop its availability by
shutting down network and communication devices [35] [21]

(c) Attack on confidentiality: Although the effect of FDI on data confidentiality ranks among
the least of all security objectives, the injection of false data could also violate the privacy of
customers, especially in AMIs of the Smart Grid. This has become so common these days as
illustrated in [49] [16].

5.2.7 Requirements based on Attack Impact on The Power System. Threat actors can exploit Smart
Grid security vulnerabilities that may lead to malfunctions in energy systems, operational failures
in communications equipment as well as physical devices, and may even trigger a cascading failure.
According to a report by NIST [93], three potential impact levels, namely low, moderate, and high
have been assessed for each of the Smart Grid security objectives following the degree of adversarial
effect and associated risk level.

Finally, the ultimate aim of FDI adversarial strategies is to pose significant consequences for the
Smart Grid, such as causing sequential transmission line outages, maximizing operation cost of
the system by injecting falsified vectors into subset of targeted meters, culminating in large-scale
failure of the power system operation, and regional/national catastrophic impacts.

6 CLASSIFICATION OF FDI ATTACK DEFENCE STRATEGIES
The success of cyber-physical attacks in general and the FDI attack in particular depends on both
the perspective of the adversary and the operator. In other words, it is highly likely that adversaries
are subject to a trade-off between maximizing the probability of impact on various cyber-physical
system components and minimizing the probability of detection of the launched attack. This
section provides extensive review of existing state-of-the-art researches on the defence against the
incumbent cyberattacks and mainly deals from the point of view of the power grid operator. The
taxonomy is presented in section 6.

There have been substantial research works on mitigation strategies against the FDI attack.
We believe that taxonomy of the different countermeasures will help other researchers in the
cyberattack defence arena to see correlations, differences, and to foresee future perspectives of
these concepts. Here, we broadly classify the countermeasures into five categories with taxonomy
depicted in Fig. 3 and details of each class are presented below.

6.1 Countermeasures Based on SE Type
6.1.1 Conventional Bad Data Detectors. BDD [1] has been an integral part of the power system
state estimators that is used to detect and remove faulty measurements caused by error due to
device malfunctions, communication channel problem, or cyberattacks, and is still widely used
in various commercial EMS software. 𝜒 2 distribution test (or for short the 𝜒 2−detector) [1] is the
most widely used BDD in the power system SE. This technique employs hypothesis testing based
on the WLS estimation to determine the cyber anomaly or bad data. The detail implementation of
𝜒 2 distribution test can be found in [34].

Largest normalised residue (LNR) [1] test is another metric for the identification of bad data. Given
the residue between the observed measurement and the estimated measurement as r = y − Hˆx,
the LNR test is based on the largest or maximum value of the normalized residue ˆri for each
measurement index 𝑖.

Typically BDDs are used in the centralised state estimators. Few researches [34] [140] [123]
extended the use of BDDs in distributed based state estimators. In [34], they suggest to divide a
power system into many non-overlapping subsystems according to the physical topology, apply SE
and a 𝜒 2 distribution test for the detection of bad data in each subsystem. The findings reveal that
the local degree of freedom is less than that obtained from the centralised SE, which results in a
better identification of bad data. Similarly, in [140] under distributed SE, a BDD is examined by
taking into account the weight of local measurement residual of sub-areas of the power system
and the overall change of measurement residual. A substation level BDD is also proposed in [123].
However, the above BDD-based detection approaches didn’t address FDI attacks (i.e. stealthiness
and attack sparsity as discussed in Section 5.1), and thus are vulnerable to the FDI attack.

6.1.2 Detection Based on SE Partitioning. By decomposing the power grid (either physical parti-
tioning as it is used in distributed SE or software partitioning) into many subsystems, measurement
redundancy can be relatively minimised, and the threshold of false data in each subsystem can
be smaller than the original system. As a consequence, the sensitivity of 𝜒 2−detector in each
subsystem would increase, thus improving the chance of attack detection. For example, the authors
of [72] suggest adaptive graph partitioning for SE and applied 𝜒 2−detector.

6.1.3 Detection Based on Dynamic SE. The absence of real-time information in the power system
operation can indeed be attributed to its use of steady state estimators that produce input data for
many EMS modules. Dynamic SE methods, on the other hand, model the time varying behaviour
of the process, making it possible to predict the state variables ahead of time. In this case, the SE
proves to be a great advantage for the system operator to conduct security analysis as well as other
EMS functions. Kalman filter (KF) has been extensively utilised in dynamic SE. There are different
extensions of KFs available, including extended KF, unscented KF (UKF), ensemble KF, particle filter
which are designed for non-linear systems [136]. The discussion of these techniques is beyond the
scope of this paper and details of each dynamic SE is found in [136].

With the emergence of dynamic state estimators more efficient countermeasure strategies than
the BDDs against the FDI attacks have been developed. In [103], a combined 𝜒 2−detector and
cosine similarity matching techniques are employed for the detection of FDI attacks in Smart Grid
where KF estimation have been used to measure any deviation from actual measurements. In the
𝜒 2−detector, the variation in the KF-estimated and measurements is used to identify the malicious
attacks, and in the cosine similarity metric, the cosine of angle between the received measurements
and the KF-estimated is computed to detect the attacks. While the 𝜒 2−detector has been confirmed
as vulnerable to the FDI attack, the cosine similarity is found to have a better detection probability
against the FDI attacks. Yet, the cosine similarity criterion is not efficient for sparse FDI attacks

12

H. T. Reda et al.

where the cosine angle between the received measurements and the injected data becomes almost
unity, which bypasses the underlying detector.

Similarly, in [79], the authors developed a detection of FDI attacks in Smart Grid, which is based
on a KF-based state estimator. Euclidean distance detector was employed to detect the discrepancies
between KF-estimated data and the received measurements. The Euclidean distance detector is
used to quantify the difference between the estimated and observed states, where amplitude of
the voltage signal is considered. If the difference is greater than a pre-determined threshold, the
detector triggers a decision on whether attack exists or not. Although the proposed approach
achieves better detection accuracy than the conventional BDDs, there are two drawbacks for
this approach. First, it considers only time-invariant states where dynamic nature of the state
variables is ignored. Moreover, the proposed detector cannot distinguish between FDI attack and
a failure due to physical faults. Different from the above, reference [141] suggested the use of a
combined UKF state prediction and WLS-based SE algorithm to detect inconsistencies between state
vector estimates and, as a result, to detect false data attacks for non-linear measurement models.
Normalised residual based on WLS and UKF estimates is computed, and compared to a predefined
threshold. Although the combined WLS and UKF estimates has a better detection of the FDI than
BDD and KF techniques, it has drawbacks. First, UKF state predictions are highly influenced by the
non-linear transition matrix and system noise, which can potentially make it difficult to distinguish
between attack-free and compromised states. Second, the accuracy of the detection relies on the
UKF predicted outcome, whose uncertainties can result in high false positives. Third, a generalised
FDI attack is considered, rather than a more stealthy and sparse FDI attack, which may pass the
proposed detector. Therefore, data of various load forecasts, proper threshold selection, and threat
model are among the critical points to consider for the robustness of the proposed methodology.
Other FDI detection approaches based on the dynamic SE include: a spatio-temporal correlations
[103] among states of the power system, short-term state forecasting-based approach for analysis
of nodal state temporal correlations [138], and a graph signal processing-based [25] scheme to
determine the graph Fourier transformation of the estimated states and to filter the high-frequency
components of the graph.

6.2 Protection-Based Defence
In Smart Grid cybersecurity, protection-based defence aims to deter the attacks by identifying a
set of measurement devices and making them immune to the incumbent cyberattacks (e.g. using
physical and efficient cryptographic methods) for ensuring observability of the states. The objective
of introducing protections to components of the Smart Grid is that the attacker could not get enough
measurements to start the FDI attacks, which otherwise will make the power system unobservable.
The idea behind this defending technique is that, for a given grid topology, certain sensor readings
affect more state vectors than others and should thus have a better cost-benefit ratio when secured
through protection. Likewise, certain state vectors are reliant on more sensor data than others, and
thus separately checking their estimation can restrict the ability of the hackers to exploit the sensor
data without being noticed. Three main research approaches have been investigated: by deploying
minimal number of PMUs, by selecting optimal set of measurements for protecting estimated state
vectors, and by perturbing grid parameters, which are discussed as follows.

6.2.1 Optimal PMU Placement. It has been found [14] that the cyberattack protection capability of
a power grid can be significantly enhanced with the integration of a few secure PMUs in the grid.
This is because PMUs measure voltage and current phasors using a standard time source based
on a global positioning system and therefore have the potential to provide precise time-stamped
measurements for geographically distributed nodes. As a result, they have secured measurements,

A Taxonomy of Cyber Defence Strategies Against False Data Attacks in Smart Grid

13

and are usually resilient against bad data injection attacks. For the same reason, in [36], linear
programming based PMU placement algorithm is used to determine the number of PMU placements
across a grid with 𝑏 number of branches and 𝑛 number of buses. For PMUs with 𝑐 current phasor
measurements, they calculated 𝑘 = (cid:0)𝑏
(cid:1) possible combinations to assign those 𝑐 PMU configurations,
𝑐
and thus the number of possible PMU configurations for all buses is calculated as 𝑁 = (cid:205)𝑛
𝑘𝑖 .
𝑖=1
Semidefinite programming approach [81] has a better solution than [36] for the problem of optimal
placement of PMUs for protecting measurements against the malicious attacks. Similarly, mixed
integer programming method [33] determines the minimum number of PMUs needed to protect
against unobservable data integrity attacks.

Compared to a polynomial time-complexity of the linear programming and semidefinite pro-
gramming, and an exponential time-complexity of mixed integer programming, greedy heuristics
[51] can provide more optimal placement of secure PMUs to defend against the bad data injection
attacks. Most of the strategies mentioned focus on evaluating the optimal placement of PMUs
to enhance power system observability, cost, and protection, and improvement of SE. However,
considering the adversary-operator dynamics, the adversary might have partial knowledge about
the operator’s corresponding defense measures, where they could optimize their attack strategy.
For instance, the PMUs and the power system can be compromised by the adversary during device
configuration process. Consequently, the aforementioned approaches are insufficient. As a solution
to the drawback, [98] proposes a predeployment PMU greedy algorithm against the attack where
the most vulnerable buses are first secured and, then, a greedy-based algorithm is used to deploy
other PMUs until the entire power system is observable. The defence space against the FDI attack
can also be strengthened using a hybrid protection-based and detection-based scheme as suggested
in [120], where the former is utilised to protect essential measurements from the intruder by means
of physical defences, and the latter is used to identify modified data. They proposed a zero-sum
static game-theoretic approach for the optimal deployment of the PMUs (for the PMU placement),
and a false data identification and prediction based on historical patterns (for the detection).

However, PMUs are very costly, and it is not practical to install enough PMUs to secure sensor
readings. It is definitely much more expensive especially with the emerging ubiquitous sensing
infrastructure in to the large-scale Smart Grid. In addition, research has shown that PMUs are
vulnerable to FDI attacks via GPS spoofing [109]. Therefore, a more appealing security scheme is
required to protect the power system against the FDI.

6.2.2 Protection Via Selection of Optimal Measurements. This is a security technique developed to
defend SE against the injection of bad data through a carefully selected subset of measurements. For
instance, reference [10] employed a brute-force search for identifying optimal set of measurements
and state vectors to ensure that stealthy data injection attacks are detected by the grid operator.
The method enables the grid operator to choose a random number 𝑞 out of 𝑛 state variables, and to
pick a random number 𝑝 out of 𝑚 sensors and should fulfill (cid:0)𝑚
(cid:1) combinations for a given choice
𝑝
of 𝑞 and 𝑝, where 0 ≤ 𝑞 ≤ 𝑛 and 0 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 𝑚. Similar to the brute-force method, fast greedy search
algorithm [40] can find optimal subset of measurements for protecting against the stealth FDI
attacks. Further, by decomposing the connected elements of the power grid into many subnetworks,
approximate solutions for the minimal number of measurements can be achieved, for example,
using mixed integer linear programming [75] model.

(cid:1)*(cid:0)𝑛
𝑞

In these three approaches, the system operator has to randomly select the number of measure-
ments to be protected. Therefore, although the proposed method can be feasible for a small number
of power systems, it is costly for a large-scale power grid. In contrast to [10], in [26] protection
measures are introduced, taking into account perfectly protected measurements (an ideal assump-
tion that no stealth data injection attacks are possible) and non-perfectly protected measurements

operator’s budget as a constraint. In support of [26], [8] derived exact and approximate solutions
satisfying a protection criterion with a minimum number of measurement data points.

However, determining such subset of measurements is a large-complexity problem. To alleviate
these complexities, other approaches in this research direction include graph-theoretical and
game-theoretical, both discussed below.

(a) Protection Based on Graph-Theoretic: Graph-theoretic approaches are widely used for the
power system observability analysis [52]. They have also been used to define optimal protec-
tion problem to safeguard state variables with a minimal set of measurements. Some of the
methods considered include the following:
• Steiner tree-based graph theory [9] (defending a set of priority-based critical state vectors).
• Optimal and suboptimal solutions for state protections by modelling the Smart Grid as a

minimum Steiner tree measurement problem [4].

(b) Protection Based on Game-Theoretic: Game theories are important theoretical frameworks
for the development of optimal decision-making of competing players, such as the adversary
and the operator in the defending space of the Smart Grid.
• The optimal set of protection can be formulated as a a three-level of defender-attacker-

operator problem [69] to deter the success of the coordinated attacks.

• A zero-sum Markov game-theoretical [77] to model the defender-attacker relationships,
where the defender can maximise their benefit by misleading the adversary to use incorrect
cost functions of the grid.

• Adaptive Markov [39] technique to dynamically compute an optimal defense scheme

against malicious attackers with dynamic and unpredictable behavior.

6.2.3 Grid Topology Perturbation. Most of legacy IT systems are static, adopted for simplicity
over time. However, in a static system, hackers can have enough time for reconnaissance against
the system, enough opportunity to learn the flaws and related attack vectors, and ultimately, to
initiate attacks against the system. Recently, moving target defense (MTD) [46] has emerged as a
proactive defence strategy that has been studied in various areas of cybersecurity. MTD is helpful
to maximise the complexity against adversaries by implementing uncertainty, or to increase the
cost attack.

Similarly, MTD has become popular among grid operators for deceiving adversaries. Grid op-
erators can proactively protect the measurements against the malicious attackers by introducing
perturbations to network data or topology. The key purpose of this strategy is to defeat the ma-
licious user who presumably knows network data or topology configurations. The perturbation
can be done by systematically changing system settings that adversaries might need to aim for
launching their attacks, in order to nullify their prior information of the system and making it im-
possible for the adversaries to adapt their attack space. In this regard, as the topology perturbation
patterns are hidden from the hackers, they cannot compute and generate the proper response for
the measurements or topology under their control that makes the FDI attack unable to correct to
remain undetectable.

There are different kinds of perturbations for protecting key grid elements against the FDI
attacks. In [84], for example, the authors applied impedance changes through a key space approach
to a number of selected transmission lines by leveraging D-FACTS4 devices in order to generate
noticeable system changes that the adversary cannot foresee. The anticipated system response is
predicted and compared to the observed measurements. Nonetheless, if a perturbation sequence
has been implemented [84] in such a way that the system is made to revert to a previously observed

4distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) are devices installed on power line to change the power flow by
altering impedance of the line

state, the difference between the anticipated result of the perturbation and the actual result of
the probe would reveal the presence of false data. MTD can also utilise both a randomized set
of measurements considered in SE and the topology of transmission line [100]. Similar line of
researches include [89] [59].

However, the above-mentioned MTD strategies have been implemented under a weak adversarial
environment in which they overlook the likelihood that sophisticated FDI attackers may also attempt
to identify MTD changes before they execute the attack. As a remedy for this limitation, the authors
of [116] introduce a hidden MTD, an approach that hardens the stealthiness of the MTD. Similar
researches have been conducted in this category including [134].

6.3 Detection Based on Statistical Modelling
Statistical models, most of which started to take hold about two centuries ago, are still widely
used in a number of modern-day fields. Several research efforts of statistical-based detection
frameworks against falsified injection of data have been addressed by the Smart Grid community.
These approaches are summarised into Generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test detector, Bayesian
test framework, quickest change detection, statistical distance index, and sparse matrix recovery.

6.3.1 GLR Test Detector. GLR test detector is one of such statistical models used for detecting
cyberattacks in the power system by leveraging the likelihood ratio of statistical tests. While it is
usually not feasible to use the GLR test detector to detect a large number of compromised samples,
it can do well to detect weak FDI attacks [55], where ℓ1-norm minimization is proposed to solve the
detection problem. In particular, it has been noted in [55] that if multiple measurement samples are
available under the same sparse FDI attack, the GLR test detector can be asymptotically optimal
in the sense that gives a very low probability of miss detection. Although the FDI detector in
[55] is valid under AWGN distribution, a study [114] has shown that it doesn’t satisfy when the
measurement are corrupted by non-Gaussian [5] noise distributions. The authors of [114] used an
independent component analysis along with the GLR test detector for an FDI attack on the basis
that the power system measurements are subject to a colored Gaussian noise (modeled through
auto-regressive process).

6.3.2 Bayesian Test Detector. Bayesian-based statistical frameworks are essential for decision-
making by leveraging prior knowledge and new evidence. For example, a strategic attacker-defender
Bayesian game-theoretic detection technique [80] against FDI may be established where the
Bayesian game is played on each node in the event of an attack on that node and a critical set of
measurements to be defended is obtained for the particular node. Further, in [73], a Bayesian-based
detector has been proposed for each monitoring node using a distributed architecture in WAMS.
Once the probability of FDI attack vectors is determined by Bayesian inference, then a recursive
Bayesian-based prediction is derived for the attack detection using measurements obtained from
real power transmission grid and simulated measurements. Other related works of Bayes approach
for the detection of FDI attacks include [30] [90] [56].

6.3.3 Quickest Change Detection. Quickest change detection (QCD) [99] (which can be performed
close to the real-time detection) is a mechanism to detect sudden changes as soon as possible on
the basis of sequential or real-time observations in such a way that minimizes the lag between
the moment a change appears and the time it is observed. When distributions of before and after
change are explicitly defined, a variety of detection methods have been suggested under different
conditions. Unlike the static BDD detection procedures, which are based on a single measurement
at a time, the QCDs consider use of dynamic change detection procedures. Overall, the objective of
this approach is to minimise the average detection time under certain detection accuracy limitations.

ACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: March 2021.

A Taxonomy of Cyber Defence Strategies Against False Data Attacks in Smart Grid

17

QCD-based detection techniques [99] [129] can be used with Bayesian model, Non-Bayesian model
(e.g. CUmulative SUM (CUSUM), adaptive CUSUM test), and statistical hypotheses test.

The following describes the literature that utilise the QCD technique to detect FDI attacks in

smart Grid:

• A Markov-chain-based QCD algorithm for dynamic SE is proposed to detect and remove FDI

attacks [88],

• a joint dynamic CUSUM and static 𝜒 2−detector in which the former leverages historical

states and the latter utilises a single measurement at a time [85],

• generalized CUSUM algorithm is suggested for quickest detection of FDI attacks for dynamic

KF-based state estimator under centralized and distributed settings [58].

• adaptive CUSUM methodology for quickest change detection using a linear unknown param-

eter solver [129],

• A Markov-chain-based adaptive CUSUM for a real-ti,e detection of FDI attacks [44],
• sequential detection of centralized and distributed FDI attacks based on the GLR test [63],
• generalized sequential likelihood ratio test for a decentralised system [62].

6.3.4 Detection Based on Statistical Distance Index. A statistical distance quantifies the consistency
of two probability distributions through, for example, a variational distance between the distribu-
tions. Kullback–Leibler (KL) distance [13] and Jensen-Shannon (JS) distance [82] have recently
been used for detecting malicious power system measurements by calculating the dissimilarity
among probability distributions obtained from measurement variations. KL distance metric has
been suggested [13] [111] to track the measurement dynamics and to detect FDI attacks. When
bad data is injected into the power systems, the variations in the probability distributions of the
measurements deviate from historical data, leading to a greater distance of KL. Likewise, the JS
distance-based detection framework [82] monitors dynamics of probability distributions obtained
from historical measurement variations and real-time measurement variations. Similarly, the JS
distance based detection is proposed to detect FDI of electricity theft in AMI [110]. Similar statistical
distance-based approaches have also been used along with data-driven techniques (see Section 6.4).

6.3.5 Detection As Low-Rank And Sparse Matrix Recovery. Another interesting research to in-
vestigate is the detection of a low-sparse FDI attack. In addition, measurement matrix obtained
at the control center has low dimensional structure due to the inherent temporal correlation of
states of the power gird. Taking into account the low-rank structure of the measurements and the
low-sparse of the false data attacks, low-rank and sparse matrix recovery, an approach which has
found applications in various fields, is another alternative for the defence against the incumbent
cyberattacks.

The detection problem of measurements with FDI attack have been formulated as a low-rank and
sparse matrix recovery [71] [70] [61]. Liu et. al [70] formulate the problem of detecting FDI attacks
as low-rank matrix recovery in the form of augmented nuclear norm5 and ℓ1-norm minimization
solved through. By considering the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of temporal attack-free
measurements of power grid and sparse FDI malicious attacks, they extended their work in [71] to
a problem of sparse matrix optimization in [70], solved using low-rank matrix factorization. On the
other hand, while the results of [71] and [70] has a good computational efficiency, they have quite
low FDI detection accuracy. Therefore, in order to obtain a better balance between the detection
accuracy and the computational performance, the authors of [61] proposed a new approach known
as ’Fast Go Decomposition’ considering the low rank behaviour of the measurement data and the
sparse FDI attack.

5nuclear norm is a convex optimization problem that is used to search for low-rank matrices.

6.4 Data-Driven Attack Detection
Various ML techniques have been employed for the detection of FDI attacks in smart power
grid. Supervised learning classifiers [96] [27] [135] [29] [31] [124] [125] are the most popular ML
techniques for the detection of false data. These techniques can reflect the statistical characteristics
of the power system using historical data and may allow the training model a better decision if
redundant power system measurements are available. Historical training data can include class
labels of normal versus tampered and using such training data a new observation is predicted
as either false data injected or normal data. Ozay et al [96] suggested supervised learning-based
binary classifiers using statistical deviations between the FDI-corrupted and secured measurements.
Similarly, in [27] an FDI detection is used based on principal component analysis for reducing
dimensionality of measurement data and supervised learning over labeled data for the classification.
In the literature, various supervised ML algorithms are employed including support vector machine
(SVM) (e.g. in [96], [27], [135]), artificial neural network (ANN) (e.g. in [31], [29], and [124]),
k-nearest neighbor (KNN) (e.g. in [125]).

One of the disadvantages of supervised learning techniques, however, is that they require far
more labelled data, which is often difficult to obtain. For this reason, semi-supervised learning
techniques address the problem of supervised learning by using partially labelled samples. In other
words, this approach seeks to label unlabeled data points using information gained from a limited
number of labeled data points. References [96] [27] [29] also employed semi-supervised algorithms.
Attack strength and sparsity are the two main factors that should be considered in the detection
frameworks. While most proposed supervised and semi-supervised approaches consider a relatively
high magnitude of FDI attacks, their detection accuracy is low for a very small attack magnitudes.
On the other hand, deep learning (DL) techniques can extract high-dimensional temporal features of
the FDI attacks with historical measurement data and can use the known features to detect various
magnitudes of FDI attacks in real-time. More specifically, the latest advance in graphics processing
units (GPU) computation provides the basis for deep neural networks such as deep feedforward
neural network (DFFNN) [7], deep belief network (DBN) as used in [42], deep recurrent neural
network (DRNN) [130] and [130], convolutional neural network (CNN) [91], and a semi-supervised
deep learning approach using generative adversarial network (GAN) framework [132].

6.5 Prevention-Based Defence
Intelligent and integrated cyber-physical resources intended to improve the stability and reliability
of the Smart Grid could be used as weapons against the grid itself. Without proper cyberattack
prevention schemes, the Smart Grid can be more vulnerable especially when it is connected to
the Internet via less secure wireless communication systems such as ZigBee [19] [104] and Wi-Fi.
Until malicious hackers successfully launch their attack vectors and inflict irreparable damage
to the power grid, they typically proceed through comprehensive technical stages, such as the
reconnaissance for investigating the technical flaws of the system. However, most of the defence
countermeasures are based on identification of the false data attack normally after the threat
compromised the data integrity at the control center, during the transmission, or at measurement
devices. To this end, lack of adequate preventive security measures against coordinated false data
attacks could be disastrous. Hence, as part of Smart Grid cybersecurity, preventive security measures
are essential in the battle against attacks such as the FDI. By providing prevention schemes across
key cyber-physical resources, we can deter the malicious users against unauthorised access of
EMS/DEM/MMS critical OT database systems, exploitation of the communication protocols (e.g
IEC 61850), compromising user privacy or data integrity via smart meters, and tampering IEDs or
interception of data transmission in WSN, IoT, and cognitive radio [105].

In order to respond effectively to threats, it is necessary to implement a wide variety of cyberattack
prevention and security techniques across the Smart Grid. Further, effective cybersecurity can also
be accomplished by combining both preventive and detective systems. In this survey paper, the
most prominent prevention systems in Smart Grid, such as cryptographic schemes and privacy
preservation using Blockchain, have been summarised, which are discussed below.

6.5.1 Cryptographic Schemes. It is highly likely that adversaries can exploit communication chan-
nels when measurements are sent from sensors to control centers or when customer data is
transmitted from smart metres to the control centres over unencrypted communication channels.
For example, the unencrypted communication channel of plain text transmission over the SCADA
network or the IEC 61850-SAS compliant communication protocol could be hacked by cyber-
enabled malicious actors, which could further mislead the control centre and other consequential
impacts. Cryptographic techniques are well matured and over the years they have been applied
in various domains for preventing different cyberattacks. However, cryptographic protocols are
difficult to implement in the Smart Grid subject to the limited computational capabilities and the
deployment in hostile environments of the measurement sensors or related devices. Therefore,
fast and efficient cryptographic operations are required for implementation in the Smart Grid to
guarantee the accuracy and integrity of measurements against FDI attacks.

In [26], it was suggested that encrypting sufficient number of IEDs could improve measurement
protection against stealthy FDI attacks and could increase overall system security in the utility
control centre. Dynamic key management-based cryptographic protocols can also deter cyberattacks
against privacy in Smart Grid wireless communication networks [128]. Similarly, a dynamic and
periodic secret-key generation scheme over Smart Grid communication network against various
cyberthreats including the FDI is proposed in [106], which enables a resilience so no adversary can
exploit the network over a longer period of time even if they know a secret key.

The Smart Grid infrastructure involves millions of electronic devices that link customers to
different cyber-physical entities. This calls for the need of a strict authentication process, which is
vital for the verification of the customers and the devices. For example, strict authentication schemes
can be implemented in IEC 62351 EMS-compliant security standard. For Smart Grid distribution
systems, an FDI prevention protocol is proposed in [43] that focuses on data integrity by preventing
packet injection, replication, modification, and access to rogue nodes for the IEC 61850-90-1 SAS
communication security standard. In particular, three stages accompany the operation of their
proposed protocol: node authentication (authentication techniques across the distribution network
including routers, gateways, inter-substation devices), peer authentication (authentication of a
routing protocol when using cloud platform for the distribution system), and data transmission.
Lightweight hash-based message authentication protocols [78] [43] are also critical for thwarting
false data attacks in IP-based data transmission in the Smart Grid environment. Further, a lightweight
authentication scheme [32] with reduced energy, communication, and computational overheads can
establish a secure communication between two communicating parties, such as smart meters and
wireless base stations, and can provide energy efficiency in a resource-constrained environment
Other prevention methods include end-to-end signature schemes, which can protect data during
an end-to-end communication in Smart Grid. For example, these schemes can protect legitimate
commands transmitted from the control center to IEDs against malicious commands sent by
adversaries [107].

6.5.2 Blockchain-Based Defence. Blockchain-based prevention schemes can strengthen the ability
of the Smart Grid to protect itself from against the incumbent cyberattacks. For example, data
protection capabilities of Smart Grids against FDI attacks can be harnessed by introducing a dis-
tributed Blockchain-based reconfigurable SCADA network features for geographically distributed

sensors [64]. Here, during transmission or reception, each information in the distributed Blockchain
network is cryptographically connected block by block, and includes signatures for verification.
Further, Blockchain can be used to preserve the privacy of user’s energy data against coordinated
data integrity attacks. A distributed blockchain network based data management on mobile nodes
for the microgrids trading is proposed in [83] that aims the prevention against false data attacks.
Blockchain-based privacy preservation mechanisms are used to protect network nodes or data
transactions in the form of a peer-to-peer crypto connectivity [64]. In [49], a Blockchain-based
bi-level privacy module and anomaly detecting module is designed to verify data integrity and
mitigate attacks of false data. A variational autoencoder and anomaly detector is proposed, where
the former is applied for transforming data into an encoded format for preventing the cyberattacks
and the latter is used to detect any interference attack.

7 LITERATURE REVIEW METHOD
The method of literature review represents the foundational first step that makes up the skeleton
of the knowledge base and largely dictates its reconstruction in the successive analysis of the
literature. Therefore, the process of a systematic search, selection, analysis, and critical evaluation
of the literature is described in this section.

Fig. 4. Literature review methodology

7.1 Literature Search Methodology
It seems that the literature search process plays an important role in crafting a comprehensive
analysis of a topic. The literature survey of this paper is based on the search methodology adopted
by Webster and Watson [122]. The systematic identification of high-quality publications (namely
review articles, journals, conferences, and Books), technical reports, and dissertations are reflections

ACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: March 2021.

A Taxonomy of Cyber Defence Strategies Against False Data Attacks in Smart Grid

of the correct selection of databases, keywords, the time covered, the papers considered in the
literature search, and performing backward and forward searches [118].

Fig. 4 is a description of the methodology used for literature search on this paper. The follow-
ing academic research databases are considered: IEEE Xplore (IEEE/IET) digital library, Elsevier
ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) digital library, SpringerLink, and
Others.

To find relevant papers, the flow chart of Fig. 4 is applied for each of the above academic research
databases. Using the first step, keywords using Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic were
identified with respect to the defence countermeasures. "Smart Grid", "power system", "false data
injection", and "cyber security" are common keywords used along with "detection", "defence",
"mitigation", and "countermeasure".

7.2 Literature Selection and Analysis
Primarily, we reflect entirely on the defence of FDI threats with respect to the Smart Grid cybersecu-
rity, as there are also FDI articles related to other areas such as WSN, healthcare, software-defined
networks, and so on. Another consideration is, while all the scholarly research sources considered
are prestigious and are assumed to publish quality works, further evaluations were made using
scientific journal ranking platforms to assess quality of the journals and the CORE6 was used for
the conferences. Based on the search method as described above, a systematic literature selection
and analysis are used which are described here. First, aggressive search was conducted using
the above keywords and step 2 of Fig. 4 that resulted in abundant number of papers. Then, after
a systematic refinement across the subcategories of the taxonomy of the FDI attack mitigation
techniques, relevant literature were selected. In addition to the keywords, titles and abstracts were
considered for correctly categorising the selected papers. Next, important concepts were assembled
for each of the chosen articles, accompanied by an overview of research results, and a thorough
analysis. After an in-depth analysis of the literature, approximately 111 papers are found which,
to varying degrees, dealt with the topic of the defence for FDI attack in Smart Grid cybersecurity.
Note that the study of FDI attack in Smart Grid started in the late 2009. Therefore, the search for
the most relevant literature of our survey starts from 2009 up to October 30, 2020 although related
literature such as the BDD goes back in time before 2009. Table 3 is a summary of the number and
source of the relevant publications considered in our survey paper.

7.3 Evaluation Criteria
In order to quantify the efficacy and associated challenges of the different defence strategies, several
key evaluation criteria against the proposed algorithms are suggested in relation to the requirements
of the power systems and the Smart Grid cybersecurity. The assessment criteria used to compare
the selected defence algorithms against the FDI attacks are summarized in Table 4.

One of the main evaluation criteria is defence algorithm, a criterion that reflects the reviewed
defence techniques. Five commonly used attack construction methodologies have been considered
for the attack model criterion, namely attack with complete information, attack with partial
information, load redistribution (LR) attack, grid topology (GT) attack, and attack using data-
driven approaches have been considered. Furthermore, the AC and DC models are considered for
the power flow model. The reviewed articles are also evaluated from network-centric point of
view (considering centralised and decentralised architecture). Additionally, the FDI attack defence
papers are investigated with regards to the numerous cyber-physical entities of the Smart Grid.
Consequently, seven major Smart Grid components, including EMS, AGC, DEM, MMS, network
& communications, intelligent devices, and renewable resources, were identified for attack target
evaluation criterion. Notice that the different components of the Smart Grid can be seen from
the discussion in Section 3. Finally, two evaluation criteria, namely performance metrics and
experimental platform have been inspected. The evaluation criteria are used to compare and
contrast among the various defence strategies as detailed in Section 8 and summarised in Table 5.

8 COMPARISON AND STATISTICS AMONG DEFENCE STRATEGIES
In our review paper, 111 publications are considered for the defence class. Here, the various
countermeasure strategies are compared and some statistical facts based on the evaluation criteria
are presented.

8.1 The Defence Strategies
The conventional BDDs, namely 𝜒 2, LNR, and detection based on SE partitioning are merely used
for bad data processing (see Section 6.1.1 for detail). Consequently, the literature considered in this
class did not take into account FDI attacks. Nevertheless, they have been blended with a variety
of other approaches for detecting the FDI attacks and serve as the basis for most countermeasure
techniques. For example, the 𝜒 2−detector and the LNR detector have been employed in the detection
based on dynamic SE subcategory.

Data-driven and detection based on statistical models are the two most popular defence categories
comprising just under half of the total, with the former standing at approximately one-quarter

and the latter at 23% of the total. Because of the complexity of Smart Grid infrastructure, the sheer
volume of data, and the fact that high-performance computing devices are becoming available, data-
driven techniques are increasingly powering various applications of the smart power system. As a
result, plenty of data-driven defence techniques especially DL and RL have been pursued these days
as means of developing more effective detection against the FDI attacks (as demonstrated in Section
6.4). The optimal placement of PMU, optimal selection of measurement quantities, MTD, all under
the protection-based category are the other prominent defence strategies against the false data
attacks in Smart Grid cybersecurity (standing at 21%). Prevention-based defences (cryptographic
functions and Blockchain technologies) are among the emerging security control mechanisms
against the incumbent cyberattacks. Especially, these techniques are popular across the demand
side management (i.e. consumption-side) of the Smart Grid.

8.2 Performance Metric
The defence strategies vary, among other things, in terms of algorithmic design, adversarial method,
attack target, and network architecture. For this reason, instead of providing a distinct performance
metrics for all the attack countermeasures, we present comprehensive qualitative metrics. A plentiful
of performance metrics are presented for each of the countermeasure subcategories (see 17𝑡ℎ column
of Table 5). For example, across the protection-based defence category, optimal subset of meter,
optimal IED protection, and attack cost are the main metrics considered. Further, packet loss,
computational cost, communication cost, and end-to-end delay are the main evaluation metrics
adopted among the prevention schemes. In most of the detection based on dynamic SE, statistical-
based models, and data-driven defence categories, detection rates (in terms of probability of
detection, True Positive Rate (TPR)) are compared against False Positive Rates (FPR) or False Alarm
Rates (FAR).

8.3 Experimental Platform
The vast majority of studies performed numerical results based on simulations of IEEE standard or
modified electric grid test cases. Various sizes of test cases have been considered, IEEE 14 bus system
being the most widely referred test case. Although the vast majority of literature use only a single
test case to conform their numerical results, some considered multiple test cases. To further verify
the efficacy of their proposal some scholars used a real-time load data, most of which used a dataset
from the New York Independent System Operator. Almost all of the studies are based on simulations
using MATPOWER7, a MATLAB power system toolbox, and few others utilise PowerFactory8 and
TOMLAB9 optimization toolbox. Finally, very a few incorporated co-simulations and hardware
testbeds.

9 MAIN GAPS OF EXISTING DEFENCE STRATEGIES AGAINST THE FDI ATTACKS
While detailed research reviews of each defence category have been addressed in Section 6, in what
follows, we describe the key gaps of existing defence researches.

Some Emerging Smart Grid Areas Are Not Well Studied: The plethora of literature exam-
ined in this review paper tried to cover a multitude of Smart Grid infrastructures; however, there
are some open issues with respect to the scope (network architecture, DERs, and communication
systems). The majority of existing countermeasure researches have focused on the traditional
centralised EMS. While decentralized energy generation and distribution systems (such as the
DERs) have become very popular, they have been among the most vulnerable cyber-physical
components to FDI attacks. But, only a few research studies have been undertaken with respect to
defence strategies of the DERs. This can be seen from the 16𝑡ℎ column of Table 5. Further, only few
papers have discussed in the SAS, AMI, and WAMS-based communication systems.

Moreover, it has been described (see section 6.5) that preventive security measures are essential in
the fight against FDI attacks in the Smart Grid. Especially, lightweight cryptography and blockchain-
based security systems are the least studied areas.

Throughout this report it has been mentioned that the power system measurement data can
reveal anomaly in the face of cyberattacks. It is also highly likely that physical faults contribute
to the abnormal functioning of the power system. Therefore, the research on FDI attack can be
extended with respect to the identification between the cyber attacks and power physical faults.
Differentiating between the cyber threats and the physical faults can be beneficial for the operators
as it helps them to react against unnecessary losses. Only very few researches [97] [6] are done in
this respect. Especially, a real-time detection scheme is required considering the sparsity of FDI
attack and low-dimensional property of the measurement data received at the control center.

General Shortcomings of the Countermeasures: Performance, Computational Cost, and
Feasibility of Deployment: The conventional BDD-based detection methods have not been able
to handle stealthy and sparse FDI attacks and are thus vulnerable to the FDI attack. Therefore,
the numerous defence algorithms analysed in the literature have achieved much stronger security
controls against the incumbent cyberattack. There are, however, certain limitations that are worth
mentioning here. For example, in spite of their potential to defend key grid components against
the bad data injection attacks, the protection-based defence schemes have certain drawbacks: First,
deployment of PMUs in the large-scale Smart Grid is much more expensive, especially with the
emerging ubiquitous sensing infrastructure. It has also been shown [109] that PMUs are susceptible
to the injection of false data attacks via GPS spoofing, which requires a more appealing security

scheme. Additionally, determining the subset of measurements is a large-complexity problem.
MTD can allow grid operators to proactively protect measurements from malicious attackers by
introducing perturbations to network data or topology that can inevitably lead to uncertainties and
costs against adversaries. Yet, the MTD protection approaches can be compromised by intelligent
FDI attackers if the attackers can identify MTD changes before they perform the attack (as has
been demonstrated in [116] [134]).

It has been seen that detection based on dynamic state estimators are more powerful countermea-
sure techniques than the BDDs; however, the use of WLS and Kalman filter-based signal processors
incurs an immense computational burden. Physics-aware data-driven defence approaches, on the
other hand, are much more robust for power system security, especially for dynamically changing
power system variables. Besides that, the prevalence of GPUs makes it practical to satisfy the com-
putational requirements of advanced ML models. Currently, deep neural networks, reinforcement
learning, and the convergence of the two are the most favoured ML models for detecting the FDI
cyberattacks.

Although missing currently, using commercial-level datasets of stealthy FDI attacks can practi-

cally verify the efficacy of data-driven countermeasure techniques.

Need for Corroboration of Experimental Results Via Testbed Platform: Although the
literature surveyed in this paper have proven their cybersecurity solutions via numerical simulations
benchmarked against standardised test cases, it is vital to validate the experimental results via
cyber-physical testbeds, which is missing in the literature except to a few of them ([135] [17] [107]).
This downside can be seen from the perspectives of data- and system-oriented approaches. Most of
the FDI attack schemes surveyed did not consider commercial-level datasets, which otherwise, can
practically validate the vulnerability of the state estimators to the stealthy FDI attacks. Even more
significant, the countermeasure techniques can also incorporate real-world off datasets.

Testbeds [38] are essential tools for testing the performance evaluation of algorithms and proto-
cols in the Smart Grid. The highly complex and multidisciplinary essence of the Smart Grid requires
the implementation of cyber-physical testbeds with different characteristics for comprehensive
experimental validation. There is a considerable need to analyse new Smart Grid security concepts,
architectures, and vulnerabilities via cyber-physical system test platforms. Recently, there is a
growing attention in the study of cyber-physical Smart Grid testbeds [38] [18]. Most notably,
hardware-in-the-loop [60] test platforms have become much more popular for the development,
analysis, and testing of cyber-physical components of the electrical power system. For example,
some Smart Grid stakeholders, such as ABB10, Siemens Power Technologies11, and OPAL RT12
foster hardware-in-the-loop testing using real-time digital simulators across various Smart Grid
realms, including microgrids, SAS- and WAMS-based protection environments. Therefore, we
suggest that assessing the effects of FDI attacks on the Smart Grid using the hardware-in-the-loop
testbed platform is critical in crafting the stringent cybersecurity requirements.

10 EMERGING ADVANCED APPLICATIONS: FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Securing the electricity grid is one of the highest priorities of many countries around the world.
Academic studies and industries are expected to tackle a range of issues for future research on
cyber defence in the Smart Grid infrastructure. Particularly, the reliance of reliable and secure
power system operation on the communication infrastructure, along with potential cyber threats

are increasingly growing. In the following, potential emerging advanced applications are discussed
as means of future research prospects.

Cybersecurity for Emerging Smart Grid Communication Systems: Despite the fact that
the communication infrastructure is the most critical target to the FDI attacks, the countermeasures
have to be studied well, especially, across the SAS-compliant IEC 61850 and the WAMS-compliant
IEEE C37.118. The FDI attack can well be studied especially with the incorporation of cyber-physical
testbed platforms [38]. Moreover, although AMI is one of the most vulnerable communication
systems to the FDI attack, little has been done on the defence against this attack. Especially, given
the increasing adoption of IoT in the Smart Grid, it will be interesting to address cybersecurity
issues of IoT-based AMI with regard to the FDI attacks. Software-defined networking [23] is one
of the emerging networking applications. The coupling of software-defined networking with
the Smart Grid applications can bring efficient network monitoring. However, the security issue
of this technology is worth investigating especially with respect to the FDI attacks. Further, it
has been indicated [94] that cognitive radio can help the implementation of a control-sensing
mechanism to identify and account for the detection of the FDI attacks in the Smart Grid. In addition,
countermeasures against FDI attacks on heterogeneous cognitive radio, WSN and IoT are potential
cybersecurity researches which are worth investigating. Specifically, the application of data-driven
models along with the countermeasure strategies across the more intelligent communication arena
of the Smart Grid seems to be a promising solution in tackling against the orchestrated cyberattacks.
Security Framework Based on Lightweight ML: Countless memory and computational-
restricted wireless sensor nodes are connected to IoT applications in Smart Grid. Several reports
have shown that such limitations raise obstacles to the usage of conventional security measures
over IoT systems. Security frameworks using lightweight ML [112] can be proposed for resource-
constrained IoT devices. For example, lightweight ML can be proposed for prevention schemes
such as encryption, message authentication, and dynamic key management against the false data
attacks in an end-to-end Smart Grid communication system.

FDI Attack Detection in Edge Computing: The growing popularity of distributed renewable
energy generation requires reduced processing costs and communication overheads. In a distributed
computing environment, edge computing [22] improves the communication overhead and system
bandwidth by bringing the processing and data storage near to the origin of data source. Further,
the emergence of Industry 4.0 across a number of industries, including the Smart Grid, brings
ubiquitous networked elements, and intelligent edge computing. Although the intelligent edge
computing is expected to be able to meet the needs of the ever-growing IoT users in the Smart
Grid, there are inherent security threats. For example, bringing more of such IoT devices to the
edge network can introduce various cybersecurity threats. FDI attacks can be challenging in edge
computing environment. Distributed detection using DL or deep RL against the incumbent attacks
can be a potential research direction in edge computing-based Smart Grid.

Blockchain Technology: A Blockchain-based defence for privacy preservation and anomaly

detection in Smart Grid is a very new research area, which requires a further investigation.

11 CONCLUSION
Smart Grid faces a growing threat from an emerging cyber-physical attack called FDI. By injecting
a stealthy falsified attack vectors, adversaries can infringe critical Smart Grid information, may
render the power system unobservable, and may culminate in large-scale failure of the power
system operation.

This survey paper analysed extensive review of existing state-of-the-art researches on cyber
defence against the incumbent cyberattacks in Smart Grid. A taxonomy of five major categories and
subcategories of the different countermeasures was proposed. Furthermore, in order to quantify

the efficacy and associated challenges of the various proposed algorithms in the literature surveyed,
a number of key evaluation criteria was used in relation to the requirements of the power systems
and the Smart Grid cybersecurity. Finally, future research directions for mitigation techniques of
the FDI attacks were also proposed as a way of advancing the Smart Grid cybersecurity framework.
