Abstract—In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and phys-
ical consequences of cyber attacks against energy management
systems (EMS). Within this framework, we have designed a
complete simulation platform to emulate realistic EMS oper-
ations: it includes state estimation (SE), real-time contingency
analysis (RTCA), and security constrained economic dispatch
(SCED). This software platform allowed us to achieve two main
objectives: 1) to study the cyber vulnerabilities of an EMS
and understand their consequences on the system, and 2) to
formulate and implement countermeasures against cyber-attacks
exploiting these vulnerabilities. Our results show that the false
data injection attacks against state estimation described in the
literature do not easily cause base-case overﬂows because of the
conservatism introduced by RTCA. For a successful attack, a
more sophisticated model that includes all of the EMS blocks is
needed; even in this scenario, only post-contingency violations can
be achieved. Nonetheless, we propose several countermeasures
that can detect changes due to cyber-attacks and limit their
impact on the system.

Index Terms—energy management system, cyber security, false

data injection, attack detection.

I. INTRODUCTION

The last decade has seen cyber-attacks become a new source
of potential failure in power systems. Several cyber-attack
incidents have occured on real-world systems, including the
Stuxnet malware targeting the Iranian power grid [1], and the
cyber-attacks that caused blackouts in Ukraine [2], [3]. Report-
edly, the U.S. power grid is under almost continuous attack [4],
and there is evidence that attackers have successfully hacked
into U.S. power systems before [5], [6].

This paper focuses on false data injection (FDI) attacks that
involve a malicious attacker replacing a subset of measure-
ments with counterfeits. FDI attacks can be designed to target
system states [7]–[9], system topology [10], [11], generator
dynamics [12], and energy markets [13]. Consequences of
FDI attacks are often evaluated via optimization problems,

e.g., FDI attacks that aim to: maximize line power ﬂow
[14], maximize operating cost [15], [16], or change locational
marginal prices [17]. However, the majority of work in the lit-
erature considers consequences only via unrealistically simple
assumptions about system operations, e.g., DC state estimation
(SE) and DC optimal power ﬂow (OPF). Modern energy
management systems (EMSs) typically involve more compli-
cated components, including real-time contingency analysis
(RTCA) and security constrained economic dispatch (SCED),
to ensure N −1 reliable operation. In addition to the constraints
modeled in DCOPF, SCED determines the system dispatch
by taking into account security constraints reported by RTCA,
as well as constraints on ramp rates and reserves. To better
understand the attack consequences on state-of-the-art EMSs,
and to design countermeasures, a Java-based EMS simulation
platform (consisting of a physical system simulator, state
estimator, RTCA, and SCED) was developed.

This simulation platform enables us to answer two funda-
mental questions. Given the documented weaknesses of some
systems (e.g. SE) and the increase in number and types of
cyber threats targeted at the energy sector, our ﬁrst goal is
to investigate further vulnerabilities which might be present
in state-of-the-art EMSs. The second main objective of this
study is to understand the practical consequences of cyber-
attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities. In a more general
sense, addressing these questions allows us to determine if the
added complexity in control and monitoring systems provides
resiliency against cyber-attacks, or if the approximations made
in modeling these systems introduce new vulnerabilities. This
understanding represents the foundation for new and improved
algorithms and countermeasures to create a more resilient
electric power grid.

The key contributions of this work and the lessons learned

through this research are as follows:

• Creating a Java-based EMS simulation platform that
includes a physical system simulator, state estimator,
RTCA, and SCED to mimic the actual operations of state-
of-the-art power systems.

• Investigating vulnerabilities that are present in state-of-
the-art EMSs through designing FDI attacks and test-
ing their physical consequences using the simulation
platform. This work shows that, by satisfying the N-1
reliability requirements, the base case solution is N-1

 
 
 
 
 
 
secure and, thus, it is hard for attackers to cause a pre-
contingency overload.

• Developing several countermeasures against such attacks
by exploiting trusted historical data and fundamental
knowledge of power systems. Extensive testing shows
that
these countermeasures can efﬁciently detect FDI
attacks.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II the core functionalities of the EMS simulation platform
are described. In Section III the software implementation of
the platform and its graphical user interface are discussed.
Section IV presents an overview of load redistribution attacks
and their impact on real-world systems operations. Finally,
in Section V several countermeasures against these attacks
are introduced and the machine learning-based detection al-
gorithm that has been implemented within the EMS platform
is described. Supporting documents, including an Appendix,
source code, and additional ﬁgures, can be found at [18].

II. ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM EMULATOR
PLATFORM: CORE FUNCTIONALITIES

In this section,

the Java-based EMS emulator platform,
which we developed, is described. In the context of power
system operations, an EMS is a critical tool that allows for
the secure and efﬁcient functioning of an electric grid. An
EMS includes monitoring capabilities such as supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, as well as
automated optimization and control tools. Figure 1 illustrates
the operation of our EMS platform. The physical system
simulator utilizes a fast-decoupled power ﬂow algorithm to
model the behavior of physical power systems. The SE uses
the measurements collected by SCADA to estimate the system
operating states and remove bad data. RTCA is then performed
based on the results of SE to obtain a list of the existing
and potential critical contingencies. These contingencies are
ﬂagged, passed to SCED, and then the SCED module gen-
erates the corresponding security criteria to protect against
the critical contingencies. The SCED solves a linear program
to ﬁnd the most economic generation dispatch that ensures
reliable operation. The backbone of the EMS emulator is
built upon commercial products developed by IncSys [19],
PowerData [20], and work developed at ASU for an ARPA-E
GENI project, an ARPA-E NODES project, and this NSF/DHS
funded project.

A. Physical System Simulator

The physical system simulator uses the fast decoupled
Newton-Raphson (FDNR) method to solve an AC power ﬂow
based on the initial generation dispatch. This method is a sim-
pliﬁed version of the Newton-Raphson method, considering
several assumptions which are discussed in [21], thoroughly.
The FDNR method considerably reduces the computation at
each iteration and the time of convergence since using the sim-
pliﬁed admittance matrices B(cid:48) and B(cid:48)(cid:48) curtails three-quarter of
the full Newton power ﬂow Jacobian matrix. Moreover, B(cid:48) and
B(cid:48)(cid:48) are constant, which means they only need to be computed
once at the beginning of the algorithm, except for changes

2

related to generation volt-ampere reactive (VAR) limiting in
B(cid:48)(cid:48) matrix, which needs to be updated. The general ﬂow of
the algorithm is shown in Fig. 2.

In [22], the authors describe the implementation of LinkNet,
a structure for the computer representation of networks which
is at the base of OpenPA. They also propose algorithms to
count connected islands in the graph, ﬁnd a certain bus, branch,
or connection list of a bus, and calculate and triangulate the
Jacobian matrix during the fast decoupled power ﬂow analysis.
These algorithms are implemented in our physical system
simulator. The OpenPA core, which has been written using
LinkNet, allows the user to efﬁciently compute the triangular
network matrices, build bus impedance matrices, and run nodal
iterative power ﬂow.

Several adjustments and improvements were added to this
general algorithm to allow the user to conﬁgure the con-
vergence threshold and, if the mismatches are close to this
threshold, distributing the slack mismatch among generators
proportionally to their maximum active power output. It also
does not allow generators to exceed their capability limits
during this process. In addition, our physical system simulator
detects if there are multiple energized islands in the system
and runs the power ﬂow for each island separately and reports
the results. During this process, reference buses to each island
are automatically assigned. These reference buses are chosen
based on node degree of the bus and its generation capability.
Static Var Compensator (SVC) devices are also monitored and
applies appropriate changes to the B(cid:48)(cid:48) matrix as the algorithm
progresses.

B. State Estimation

State estimation enables real-time monitoring of power
systems. Measurements, including branch real and reactive
power ﬂows, bus real and reactive power injections, and bus
voltage magnitudes, are collected by SCADA and sent to the
system control center to estimate the system states, namely the
bus voltage magnitudes and phase angles. The solution of state
estimation provides a starting point for the following EMS
processes including real-time contingency analysis, voltage
security assessment tools, voltage support service, and other
advanced network applications [23].

Our generalized SE includes observability analysis (OA),
bad data detector (BDD), and bad data eliminator (BDE) as
shown in Fig. 1. OA determines whether all system states can
be estimated from available measurements; if successful, the
system is observable and SE is performed on the whole system.
Otherwise, OA will output several observable islands, and SE
is performed on each island. Our OA algorithm is adopted
from [24] and its detailed description is given in Appendix A
[18]. The system states ˆx are estimated using Weighted Least-
Squares (WLS) method from measurements z = h(x) + e as
described in [23], where z is the measurement vector, x is the
vector of true states, h(·) is the non-linear relationship between
measurements and states, and e is additive noise. Givens
rotation [25] is used to perform orthogonal factorization when
solving the normal equation. The detailed SE algorithm is
given in Appendix B [18]. The estimated states ˆx are then

3

used to recalculate the measurements ˆz = h(ˆx), and the
BDD applies a χ2-test to detect bad data. If bad data exists,
the measurement that has the largest normalized residual is
eliminated by the BDE. OA and SE are then performed on
the remaining measurements until the χ2-test is passed.

C. Real-time Contingency Analysis

After SE determines the power system operating states,
RTCA is run to evaluate the impact of power system com-
ponent failures. Industry planning and operating criteria often
enforce N − 1 reliability, which requires that a system must
operate in a stable and secure manner following any single
transmission or generation outage. This is ensured by taking
each system element (generating unit, transmission line, trans-
former) out of service one at a time, and re-running power ﬂow
to see if there are any (potential) violations to voltage and line
limits.

Our RTCA focuses on branch (transmission line and trans-
former) outages and violations. Outages of radial branches can
break the system into islands and are out of the scope of this
paper. All the radial branches are identiﬁed in the system and
they are excluded from the contingency list. Then, the contin-
gency rating of every branch is determined, as branches are
typically allowed to safely carry a relatively higher power ﬂow

for a short period of time compared to their long-term power
ratings. Subsequently, AC power ﬂow is run as described in
Sec. II-A by taking one branch out of service, sequentially
from the contingency list, to see if it leads to violations or
potential violations on any other branches. If any of the other
branches have ﬂows higher than their contingency ratings
(violations) or close to them (warnings), their power ﬂow
magnitudes are recorded, and this branch outage is ﬂagged
as a critical contingency. This process is performed until
outages of all branches in the contingency list are processed.
Finally, RTCA creates a list of critical contingencies along
with the corresponding violations, branches with warnings,
and their power ﬂow magnitudes. This information is sent
to the subsequent SCED function as transmission security
constraints to determine the generation dispatch for the next
operating period; this process is illustrated in Fig. 3 (ﬁgure
courtesy of Dr. Xingpeng Li, [26]).

D. Security-constrained Economic Dispatch

In today’s power system operation, SCED is one of the
key functions of the EMS. It is an optimization program that
ﬁnds the least cost generation satisfying all the operation and
security constraints. Though the AC power ﬂow model is more
accurate, it is not used due to its computational complexity.
Typically, SCED is a linear program (LP) since all generators’
status are considered as ﬁxed input and DC power ﬂow model

Thus, DC power ﬂow model based SCED is simple
and optimality can be guaranteed.

However, the optimal generation dispatch point output by
the SCED needs to be applied on the physical AC system.
Therefore, properly approximating the AC system in a DC
SCED model is crucial to the SCED formulation. The three
following types of AC approximation techniques are used to
better mimic the AC system behavior in order to provide a bet-
ter SCED solution. A more in-depth and detailed description
of the following considerations can be found in [26].

(i) The ﬁrst approximation technique is to model AC system
losses in the DC SCED model. Without handling the losses,
the SCED dispatch solution is not sufﬁcient
to cover the
system loads and real power losses, and could potentially
lead to AC power ﬂow non-convergence issues. Five different
options have been implemented to handle the losses; the ﬁrst
two options are to simply distribute the real loss on load
or generator buses respectively, and in the three remaining
options losses can be added on each branch to the receiving-
bus, sending-bus, or half of the loss to the receiving-bus and
half to the sending-bus as virtual loads, respectively.

(ii) The second AC approximation technique is to derate
the normal and emergency branch MVA ratings to obtain the
branch MW ratings, by taking the reactive power ﬂows into
consideration. If the SCED uses AC ratings as branch limit
constraints, the resulting generation dispatch from SCED may
create real power ﬂows on lines at their apparent power limits.
Along with the reactive power ﬂows, it may result in branch
overﬂows in terms of apparent power. Thus, the branches can
be derated to avoid this issue. Given a branch k with AC
branch limit Sk,max, the limit of this branch in base case can
be modeled as

(cid:113)

Pk,max =

k,max − max(Q2
S2

kf , Q2

kt),

(1)

where Qkf and Qkt are the from and to end branch reactive
power ﬂows, respectively. In contingency case, Skc,max, the
emergency MVA rating of branch k, is used instead of Sk,max
to determine the contingency case branch limit Pkc,max.

(iii) Finally,

the last approximation is to calculate the
branch real power ﬂows (both base case and contingency
case) by summing up their pre-SCED AC values and the DC
approximated changes caused by the SCED re-dispatch, so
that they are not computed using just purely DC power ﬂow
equations.

The complete SCED formulation used in our platform can
be found in Appendix C [18]; here, the main characteristics
and capabilities of the algorithm we implemented are summa-
rized. The SCED aims to minimize the sum of operating cost
and reserve cost, assuming a piece-wise linear cost function
for all generators. Consistent with industry (ISO) practice,
some relaxations to SCED are applied: there are load shedding
variables in both base case and contingency case, as well
as a slack variable for violation of the generator minimum
input. Penalty factors are given to these slack variables in
the objective function, so that under normal operations, all
slack variables should be zero. Non-zero load shedding indi-
cates that the system is unable to serve the load given the
transmission capacity and generator ramp rate limits, while

4

non-zero generator lower bound slack variables indicates that
there are too many committed units. The constraints in our
SCED include (both in base case and contingency case)
power balance equations, load equations, branch ﬂow limits
(a power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) based formulation
is adopted in calculating branch power ﬂows from bus power
injections), unit generation equations, ramp rate limits, and
interface limits. An interface limit constrains the power ﬂow
from one area to another to avoid voltage issues, generally
through several major transmission lines. The interface limit
is typically lower than the algebraic sum of the thermal limits
of all the lines constituting the interface, but it can be included
in SCED based on the operators’ prior knowledge. In addition,
generation limits and spinning reserve limits are also included.
Though generator contingencies are not modeled, the SCED
formulation contains a reserve requirement constraint, which
ensures a system wide procurement of reserves that would be
sufﬁcient to cover the loss of an arbitrary generator.

III. PLATFORM IMPLEMENTATION

A. Web-based Graphical User Interface

To better study the process of FDI attacks and demon-
strate their consequences, a web-based graphical user interface
(GUI) is developed which allows the user to interact with all
of the platform blocks. The environment is designed to mimic
real world power system operations with an interface that aims
to be easy to use and familiar to system operators. A user
can view power system connectivity information and also run
power ﬂow, state estimation, contingency analysis, and SCED
on a given system. With these capabilities, the platform can
simulate the behavior of a power transmission system and its
EMS in (almost) real-time.

The platform has been created using a combination of Java
and Scala programming languages. It uses OpenPA as a com-
putational back-end to handle the power system model and run
many of the power system calculations. The web-based GUI
translates user commands to OpenPA functions and the results
are returned back through the web application to a highly
customizable visualization tool written using CytoScapeJs.
The whole platform has been designed in a modular style with
full decoupling between back-end and front-end. Moreover,
both back-end and front-end have a modular structure to
make extensions and improvements more straightforward. All
the details on the software design of the platform and web
application are described in [27].

Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the web-based GUI high-
lighting the main components of the platform. On the left is
an interactive visualization of the system graph: the user can
explore the system by zooming, panning, and obtaining details
of each component by simply clicking on them (transmission
line parameters, load and generator data, etc.). The panel on
the right represents the core of the EMS platform; all of the
functions can be set up and run via the GUI. In addition to the
traditional EMS blocks, the diagram also includes the novel
anomalous data detector which we have designed to detect FDI
attacks against SE. The details of the detection algorithm are
discussed in Section V-A. Figure 4 illustrates that the attack

5

Fig. 4. EMS Platform Graphical User Interface

detector can be used in parallel to the traditional bad data
detector; as explained in the next section, an unobservable
FDI attack will not trigger the residue-based detector. The
screenshot of the interface shows that when the attack is
injected and SE is performed over the malicious data, our
detector is able to ﬂag the anomaly before the false states are
used to perform RTCA and SCED.

Finally, backed by OpenPA, the platform makes comprehen-
sive and detailed reports available for download to the user.
For example, the user can examine every step of the power
ﬂow solution or view contingencies or SCED solution reports
in detail. Using these reports, informative diagrams can be
created to give profound insight into the designed attacks.

The code of the web-based GUI interface and the proposed
attack detector as well as the power systems models used for
our simulations are publicly available at [18]. This GitHub
repository also contains a video showcasing the EMS platform:
it presents all of the main functions and it shows the complete
process of a cyber-attack, from the injection of the falsa data
to the physical consequences on the system. The video can
also be found at: https://youtu.be/UDAMI3gi3WI.

B. Power System Test Models

The modular nature of the EMS platform, from its core
functionalities to the web interface, is also reﬂected in its abil-
ity to incorporate many power system models. As part of our
work on cyber-attacks and countermeasures, we have studied
several different grid models varying in size and complexity.
At the moment, the platform includes three systems:

1) Cascadia is a small-scale synthetic system on the footprint
of the grid of Washington state. It is made up of 179
buses, 72 loads, and 37 generators.

2) the Polish system available from Matpower [28]. This
system has 2383 buses, 1822 loads, and 327 generators.

3) the synthetic Texas system [29]; it has 2000 buses, 1125

loads, and 544 generators.

New systems can be imported into the EMS platform via an
automatic conversion and import function from PSS/E’s .raw
ﬁle format. While this process is fully automated, some manual
tuning of the imported system might be required depending
on the quality of the original model. Commonly, some tuning
will be needed in order to obtain a base case scenario which
is feasible under the RTCA and SCED constraints. This might
entail modifying generator commitment schedules or generator
set-points; in some cases, line limits and load values need to
be veriﬁed to ensure N-1 feasibility.

IV. LOAD REDISTRIBUTION ATTACKS
A false measurement vector ¯z created with state attack

vector u,

¯z = h(x + u) + e,

(2)

is unobservable to the conventional bad data detector (BDD)
embedded within SE, because it is not distinguishable from
the true measurements if the true states were (x + u). Given
a ﬁxed generation dispatch, unobservable FDI attacks make it
appear as the loads are redistributed among load buses, while
the total net load remains unchanged. The redistributed loads
will cause the system to incorrectly re-dispatch the generators,
resulting in physical and/or economic consequences.

Typically, an attacker aims to maximize the attack conse-
quences given its limited resources (e.g., number of measure-
ments controlled). Attacker-defender bi-level linear programs
(ADBLPs) can be used to ﬁnd the worst-case attacks. A
general ADBLP is given by

(3d)

where u is the attack vector, v is the system decision variable,
which can include generation, reserve, load shedding, etc.
The attacker’s objective (3a) can be any physical/economic
consequence, e.g., maximize the physical power ﬂow on a
transmission line, or maximize the operating cost. The at-
tacker’s limitations (3b) typically involve its resources (e.g.,
number of measurements controlled), as well as the load shift
resulting from the attack. Here load shift is characterizing the
detectability of the attacks, as large load shift may easily trig-
ger system alarm. The defender’s problem (3c)–(3d) models
the system response under attack.

Prior work [10], [11], [14]–[17] considers only DCOPF as
the system response to show the system vulnerabilities to FDI
attacks. However, we have found that if the attacker merely
solves an ADBLP considering DCOPF as the system response
while the system is actually operating using RTCA and SCED
as outlined in Fig. 1, the attacker will not accurately predict
the system response, and hence, the attacks will not cause
the expected consequences. Fig. 5 [30] illustrates an example
based on our experiments on the synthetic Texas system. The
attacker solves an attack design ADBLP assuming the system
operates using DCOPF, and creates false measurements to
launch an attack, aiming to maximize the physical power ﬂow
on a target branch. The system performs RTCA and SCED to
ﬁnd the optimal generation dispatch, which yields the actual
physical power ﬂows. From this ﬁgure, it can be noted that the
attacker predicted power ﬂows exceed the rating of the branch
for every load shift, but the actual ﬂows do not.

Accurately predicting the system response requires the
attacker to gain knowledge of the detailed design of RTCA
and SCED used by the system. Although it is not impossible
to have this level of knowledge, it is extremely difﬁcult to have
such strong attackers in practice. However, those attackers
can cause the worst-case consequences on EMSs by modeling
SCED as the system response in the attack design ADBLP.
In [30], such an ADBLP is formulated for the synthetic Texas

system and is solved using a modiﬁed Benders’ decomposition
algorithm introduced in [31]. The objective of the attacker
is to maximize the physical power ﬂow on a target branch,
either in the base case or under contingencies. It is shown
that no base case overﬂows can be caused by the attacks due
to the conservatism provided by N − 1 reliability, but post-
contingency overﬂows can still occur, making the system no
longer N − 1 reliable. Fig. 6 [30] compares the physical and
cyber RTCA results after the re-dispatch resulting from an
attack designed by considering SCED as the system response,
aiming to maximize the post-contingency physical power ﬂow
on a target branch. The system operators observe the cyber
post-contingency power ﬂows on the x-axis, while the post-
contingency physical power ﬂows are shown on the y-axis. It
can be seen that the attack successfully spoofs the operator
by making the system appear to be in a secure state, while
in reality, ﬁve post-contingency violations are caused by the
attack with a maximum post-contingency overﬂow of 112.2%
on the target branch.

V. DATA-DRIVEN COUNTERMEASURES TO LR ATTACKS

As explained in section IV, FDI attacks against SE effec-
tively result in the system operator estimating slightly modiﬁed
system loads. For this reason, this type of attacks falls in the
class of load redistribution (LR) attacks. This observation is
the basis for an improved class of detectors that are able to
analyse the estimated load values and determine if they are
the result of an FDI attack. This section describes the design
of an algorithm that, leveraging the wealth of historical data
that is already available to system operators, learns patterns
in normative data and checks that the measured loads follow
these patterns. The basic concept was ﬁrst explored in [32],
where multiple machine learning techniques were tested and
compared. Following the promising results from that work, a
nearest neighbor based algorithm has been fully developed
to scale to very large systems and attempt to localize the
maliciously modiﬁed loads [33]. As the culmination of our

platform to showcase its capability and suitability as a tool for
system operators.

A. Attack Detection Algorithm

The proposed attack detector is based on the idea that
the system loads at any given time follow some underlying,
recurring patterns; if an attacker arbitrarily modiﬁes a subset
of the loads, these patterns will be violated. Nearest neighbor
works by ﬁnding the minimum distance between the data-point
to be tested (i.e. the set of loads at a given time) and a dataset
of historical points which are assumed to be attack free (i.e.
the historical measured load values). A thresholding approach
can then be used to deﬁne a point as normal if its distance
to the historical data is small or anomalous in case of large
distance.

Let us deﬁne the vector containing the load values computed
from SE as p and the historical load vector at time i as hi.
The closest distance d for sample p is deﬁned as

d = min

r=[1:nh]

(cid:107)p − hr(cid:107)2 .

(4)

where nh is the total number of historical points. The minimum
distance d is compared against a predetermined threshold τ to
label the load proﬁle p as normal or attacked.

As the number of loads in a system increases, the dimen-
sionality of the load vectors gets larger reducing the efﬁcacy
of the algorithm. As highlighted in [33], when computing
the Euclidean distance between high dimensional vectors, the
effect of the small subset of attacked loads over the entire
system is diminishingly small. To overcome this challenge
and make the detector scalable to systems of any size, the
algorithm has been modiﬁed so that it simultaneously analyzes
small groups of neighboring loads identifying any suspicious
loads. In this case, the minimum distance for each group of
loads is computed;

dj = min

r=[1:nh]

(cid:107)pj − hj

r(cid:107)2

(5)

where pj is the set of real-time values for the loads in group
gj, hj
r is the subset of loads belonging to group gj from the rth
historical load vector. The minimum distance is then compared
to the threshold τj to determine if the loads in group gj are
normative or anomalous; if dj > τj an alarm for that group
is raised. This process is repeated for every group and if one
or more alarms are raised, the load vector p is labeled as
anomalous.

In [33], the improved algorithm is tested on the synthetic
Texas system against a wide range of LR attacks. Figure 7
demonstrates the performance of the detector against FDI
attacks by showing the detection probability as a function of
the percentage line loading on the target line and the estimated
false alarm rate. It can be seen that any attack which would
result in signiﬁcant line overloads is detected with almost
perfect accuracy.

rate.

B. Further Countermeasure Approaches

In addition to the nearest neighbor detector that has been
implemented in the platform, we have developed and tested
several other approaches to attack countermeasures.

The grouping strategy described in Section V-A allows to
perform a further risk assessment of the measured system loads
and determine how likely each load is to be attacked. After
identifying the groups of loads that likely contain values that
have been maliciously modiﬁed, the loads within each group
are analyzed independently. Using a metric called Z-score it
is possible to determine how far a load is from its normal
behavior, thus characterizing its likelihood of being attacked.
This technique and its results are discussed in detail in [33].
An alternative attack detector, based on support vector
models, is presented in [34]. Instead of relying solely on the
historical data, this detector uses a support vector regression
(SVR) model to predict the bus-level loads at the next time
step; then, using a support vector machine (SVM), the actual
system loads and their forecasted values are analyzed to
determine if any difference between them is due to a cyber-
attack or normal system behaviors.

Finally, a real-time non-probabilistic approach to detect
LR attacks attempting to cause an overﬂow in smart grids
is proposed in [35]. First, power systems domain insight is
leveraged to identify an underlying exploitable structure for
the core problem of LR attacks in [36], which enables the
in the second
prediction of the attackers’ behavior. Then,
part of the study, a security index based on the identiﬁed
structure in [36] is developed. This security index can be used
in practice, with minimal disruptions in the existing EMSs, to
ﬂag LR attacks.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, the design of an EMS simulation platform
is described and it is shown how it allows for the detailed
study of cyber-attacks on power systems and their physical
consequences.

Two important and contrasting lessons about the cyber-
security of modern energy management systems can be learned
from the results of our simulations and tests. On the one hand,

it is shown in Section IV that the added complexity of systems
such as RTCA and SCED provides a further layer of defense
against cyber-attacks. Speciﬁcally, these tools result in more
conservative system operations which in turn yield system
states that are harder (if not impossible) to be manipulated
by an attacker. Nonetheless, since this added security is not
achieved by design as a response to cyber-attacks, but it is
simply a byproduct of other power system considerations, it is
still possible for a very sophisticated attacker to cause physical
consequences and damage to a system. If an attacker gains
knowledge of all the control and monitoring tools employed by
the operators, it can create attacks that target post-contingency
violations. While these are not as immediate of a threat as
base case attacks (remember, a physical contingency must
happen in order for the unobservable cyber-attack to cause
consequences), they still highlight a vulnerability that could
be exploited by powerful, well funded attackers. It is for this
reason, that we have proposed several attack detection and
mitigation schemes.

In general, the EMS platform we built has demonstrated to
be a very useful and powerful tool for the analysis of power
system operations. Moreover,
its modular design structure
makes it an ideal platform for the development and imple-
mentation of new tools beyond cyber security applications.

As part of our future work, we are looking at possible
improvements and further developments of our attack coun-
termeasures. The detection algorithms can be expanded to
include the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of more classes of
cyber-attacks as well as system events and natural phenomena.
Moreover, the insight provided by detector based on support
vector models can be leveraged for the decision making
process following a cyber-attack. In particular, the predicted
loads can be used as a replacement for the counterfeit values,
practically nullifying the negative effects of the attack.
