Abstract—By using various sensors to measure the surround-
ings and sharing local sensor information with the surrounding
vehicles through wireless networks, connected and automated
vehicles (CAVs) are expected to increase safety, efﬁciency, and
capacity of our transportation systems. However, the increasing
usage of sensors has also increased the vulnerability of CAVs to
sensor faults and adversarial attacks. Anomalous sensor values
resulting from malicious cyberattacks or faulty sensors may
cause severe consequences or even fatalities. In this paper, we
increase the resilience of CAVs to faults and attacks by using
multiple sensors for measuring the same physical variable to
create redundancy. We exploit this redundancy and propose a
sensor fusion algorithm for providing a robust estimate of the
correct sensor information with bounded errors independent of
the attack signals, and for attack detection and isolation. The
proposed sensor fusion framework is applicable to a large class
of security-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). To minimize
the performance degradation resulting from the usage of esti-
mation for control, we provide an H∞ controller for CACC-
equipped CAVs capable of stabilizing the closed-loop dynamics
of each vehicle in the platoon while reducing the joint effect
of estimation errors and communication channel noise on the
tracking performance and string behavior of the vehicle platoon.
Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness
of our methods.

I. INTRODUCTION

Our transportation systems are enhancing its intelligence
with the surge of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs).
With the increasing connectivity and automation, CAVs are
expected to provide a safer, more efﬁcient and environmen-
tally friendly transportation systems [1][2]. Compared with
traditional ones, CAVs use a variety of sensors to measure the
surroundings so that various driving tasks such as lane keep-
ing, collision avoidance, and vehicle following can be fulﬁlled.
Moreover, taking the advantage of wireless communications,
CAVs are now able to share their local sensor information with
the surrounding vehicles and roadside units to increase trafﬁc
efﬁciency, safety or form vehicle platoonings. Therefore, the
accuracy of the on-board sensors has to be guaranteed to
achieve safe and secure driving and anomalous sensor values
which result from malicious cyberattacks or faulty sensors can
lead to severe consequences or fatalities in the worst case [3].
However, sensors of CAVs might be designed without security

considerations and hence remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. For instance,
in [4], a self-driving vehicle based
on LiDAR was compromised remotely by an attacker who
generates more echoes of objects and vehicles. In [5], the au-
thors investigate the vulnerabilities of millimeter-wave radars,
ultrasonic sensors and forward-looking cameras to attacks
and show that off-the-shelf hardware can be used to perform
jamming and spooﬁng attacks on a Tesla Model S automobile.
It has been shown in [6] that inexpensive commodity hardware
can be used to perform various types of attacks, e.g., blinding,
jamming, replay and spooﬁng attacks on camera and LiDAR
systems. This shows that we need strategic countermeasures
for identifying and dealing with sensor attacks on CAVs.

Security and privacy problems for general cyber-physical
systems under sensor attacks have been addressed using vari-
ous methodologies [7] -[14]. Traditional works on autonomous
vehicles security focus on the cryptography part, e.g., design-
ing new protocols for device authentication and data transmis-
sion [15], [16]. There are only a few results addressing and
solving the problem of quantifying (minimizing) the perfor-
mance degradation induced by attacks on CAVs. In [17], [18],
the authors exploit sensor redundancy and provide detection
and isolation algorithms for a single vehicle under sensor
attacks. The problem of achieving consensus against replay
attacks in an operator-vehicle network is solved in [19]. A
control scheme is provided in [20] for a vehicle platoon whose
communication network, DSRC, is under Denial-of-Service
(DoS) attack. In [21], suitable countermeasures to detect replay
attack for connected vehicles are provided. The authors of
[22] provide an algorithm for detecting sensor attacks on
connected vehicles using a set-membership ﬁltering technique.
The problem of attack detection and estimation for connected
vehicles under sensor attacks is solved using an unbiased
ﬁnite implulse response (UFIR) estimator in [23]. Shoukry
et al. [24] suggest randomly turning off the transmitter for
detecting attacks on LiDARs, which however may degrade
system performance. Attack-resilient sensor fusion algorithms
for cyber-physical systems are proposed in [25][26], where
multiple so-called abstract sensors are used to measure the
same physical variable and some of them are under attacks.
Each abstract sensor provides a set with all possible values for
the true state of the variable for the fusion algorithm, and then
an attack-free fused measurement is obtained by checking the
intersections of these sets. We provide a secure sensor fusion
framework for CAVs under sensor attacks, where noise on
sensor measurements is assumed to be bounded with unknown
bounds, which might be applicable to a large class of security-
critical CPSs.

Our sensor fusion approach is inspired by the work in [10],
where the problem of state estimation for continuous-time
linear time-invariant (LTI) systems is addressed. The authors
propose a way of constructing an estimator using a bank of
Luenberger observers, that provides a robust state estimation
despite the fact that sensor attacks are present. The main idea
of their estimation scheme is to place redundant sensors in
the system. Sensor redundancy has been proved to be crucial
for estimation under attacks [27], [10], [28], [29], [14], [30].
Using redundant sensors/actuators for secure estimation and
control is a commonly adopted technique, see, e.g., [27], [10],
[28], [29], [11], [31], and references therein. Note that it
might be costly to create redundancy, which indicates some
of these estimation methods might have conservative appli-
cations; however, for security-critical systems, for instance,
CAVs, this is the price to pay [6].

In this manuscript, exploiting sensor redundancy, we address
the problem of robust sensor fusion, attack detection and iso-
lation, and control for a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control
(CACC) equipped CAV in a vehicle platoon under sensor
attacks. Assuming each vehicle in the platoon is equipped
with multiple on-board sensors that measure the same physical
variable, we consider the case where all the sensor measure-
ments are subject to bounded noise with unknown bounds
and the adversary has limited capability such that only less
than half of the sensors are compromised. We assume that the
set of attacked sensors are not a priori known to us and can
be time-varying. For instance, the time-variance of the set of
attacked sensors may be caused by the attack strategy adopted
by the attacker with energy-saving considerations [32]. For
every subset of sensors, we compute the largest difference
between the average value of all the sensor measurements and
the measurement of every single sensor in the subset. Then
we select the sensors that lead to the smallest difference. If
some of the sensors are under attacks, their measurements
produces larger difference than the attack-free ones, in general
and hence will not be used by the algorithm for estimation. Our
fusion algorithm provides estimation errors that are bounded
independent of the attack signals. Once we have an attack-
free measurement, we provide algorithms for detecting and
isolating the attacked sensors under the condition that the noise
bounds are known. Finally, for each vehicle in the vehicular
platoon, we provide a robust CACC scheme that stabilizes
its closed-loop dynamics while minimizing the joint effect of
estimation errors and channel noise on the platooning string-
stable behavior as well as the tracking performance of each
vehicle. Our controller design method is an extension of the
results given in [33] by assuming system disturbances are
present. In the case of cyberattacks, we show that a separation
principle between sensor fusion and control holds and the
vehicle platoon can be stabilized by closing the loop with the
fusion algorithm and the robust controller. We conclude on
stability of the closed-loop dynamics of each vehicle in the
platoon from Input-to-State Stability (ISS) [34] of the closed-
loop system with respect to the bounded estimation error. The
performance of our methods is illustrated in several numerical
examples.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, some

preliminary results needed for the subsequent sections are
presented. In Section III, we describe the vehicle platoon
system we consider. In Section IV, we show that our fusion
scheme provides robust estimates of the sensor measurements
despite sensor attacks. In Section V, algorithms for detecting
and isolating sensor attacks are presented. The proposed robust
CACC scheme and stability analysis are given in Section VI.

II. PRELIMINARIES

A. Notation

√

We denote the set of real numbers by R, the set of natural
numbers by N, and Rn×m the set of n × m matrices for
any m, n ∈ N. For any vector v ∈ Rn, we denote vJ the
v(cid:62)v,
stacking of all vi, i ∈ J, J ⊂ {1, . . . , n}, |v| =
and supp(v) = {i ∈ {1, . . . , n} |vi (cid:54)= 0}. For a sequence
{v(t)}∞
t=0, ||v||∞ := supt≥0 |v(t)|, v(t) ∈ Rn. We say that a
sequence {v(t)} belongs to l∞, {v(t)} ∈ l∞, if ||v||∞ < ∞.
||v(t)||Lp is the p-norm of signal v(t). We denote the car-
dinality of a set S as card(S). The binomial coefﬁcient is
denoted as (cid:0)a
(cid:1), where a, b are nonnegative integers. We denote
a variable m uniformly distributed in the interval (z1, z2) as
m ∼ U(z1, z2) and normally distributed with mean µ and
variance σ2 as m ∼ N (µ, σ2).

Deﬁnition 1 (Vehicle String Stability) [35] Consider
a
string of m ∈ N interconnected vehicles. This system is
string stable if and only if

||zi(t)||Lp ≤ ||zi−1(t)||Lp , ∀t ≥ 0, 2 ≤ i ≤ m,

(1)

where zi(t) can either be the distance error ei(t), the velocity
vi(t) or the acceleration ai(t) of vehicle i; z1(t) ∈ Lp is a
given input signal, and zi(0) = 0 for 2 ≤ i ≤ m.

III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

Consider a platoon of m vehicles, shown in Figure 1. Denote
the distance between vehicle i and its preceding vehicle i − 1
as di, and its velocity as vi. The objective of each vehicle is
to keep a desired distance with its preceding vehicle:

dr,i(t) = ri + hivi(t), i ∈ Sm,

where hi represents the time headway of the i-th vehicle, ri is
the standstill distance. Sm = {i ∈ N|1 ≤ i ≤ m} denotes the
set of all vehicles in a platoon of length m ∈ N. The spacing
policy adopted here is expected to improve string stability [36],
[33]. The spacing error ei(t) is then deﬁned as

ei(t) =di(t) − dr,i(t),

=(qi−1(t) − qi(t) − Li) − (ri + hivi(t)),

(6)
The feedforward term ui−1 is transmitted from vehicle i−1
to vehicle i through wireless communication channels. vi is
measured by a wheel speed sensor of vehicle i, ai is measured
by its accelerator. di is measured by e.g, an ultrasonic sensor,
a LiDAR, a radar, or a vision sensor.

IV. SECURE SENSOR FUSION UNDER SENSOR ATTACKS

Compared with the wheel speed sensor and the accelerator,
which might require attackers’ physical access to be com-
promised, these sensors that measure di are more exposed
to the adversarial environment as they can be attacked from
a distance [38], [39], [6], [5]. Therefore, we assume each
vehicle in the platoon is equipped with N different on-board
sensors for measuring di, i.e., at every time t, vehicle i has N
different measurements of di(t). These measurements can be
provided by a combination of various types of sensors, e.g.,
a combination of an ultrasonic sensor, a milimeter wave radar
and a LiDAR, or multiple same type of sensors, e.g., multiple
radars, or multiple LiDARs with different wavelengths etc..
Then, we assume q (q < N ) measurements are under attacks:

D(t) =

(7)

where νi ∈ R and {νi(t)} ∈ l∞ denotes measurement noise in
each sensor, and η ∈ RN denotes the vector of attack, i.e., if
the i-th sensor is compromised, then ηi(t) (cid:54)= 0 for some t ≥ 0;
otherwise ηi(t) = 0 for all t ≥ 0. Let W (t) ⊂ {1, . . . , N }
represent the unknown set of attacked sensors at time t, i.e.,

supp(η(t)) ⊆ W (t).

(8)

We assume an attacker attacks a sensor by modifying its
measurement to any arbitrary value.

Remark 1 It is usually assumed in the literature, e.g., [10],
[7], [12], [11], [28], [29], [31] that
the set of attacked
nodes is time-invariant, i.e., the attacker cannot change his
mind by attacking the other nodes rather than the ones he
chose initially. We relax this assumption by allowing the set
of attacked sensors to be time-varying, i.e., the attacker can
choose a different set of sensors to compromise at different
time.

Deﬁnition 2 (Reconstructability) di(t)
from D(t) under q attacks for all t ≥ 0, if for every di(t),
¯di(t), sets Wa(t), Wb(t) ⊂ {1, . . . , N } with card(Wa(t)),
card(Wb(t)) ≤ q, and supp(ηa(t)) ⊆ Wa(t), supp(ηb(t)) ⊆
Wb(t), and all t ≥ 0 we have

is

D(t) = ¯D(t) =⇒ di(t) = ¯di(t).

(9)

This deﬁnition means that if di(t) is reconstructible from
D(t) under q attacks, then there do not exist two distinct
values di(t) and ¯di(t) that can explain the received data with
less than q sensors attacked, hence di(t) can be reconstructed
unambiguously.

Theorem 1 di(t) is reconstructible from D(t) under q attacks
for all t ≥ 0 if and only if q < N
2 .

Proof:

1) if: Suppose that q < N

2 . For all ηa(t) and ηb(t) with
card(supp(ηa(t))) ≤ q and card(supp(ηb)(t)) ≤ q and t ≥
0, the nonzero elements of ηb(t) − ηa(t) cannot exceed 2q,
which is strictly smaller than N . Therefore, there do not exist
ηa(t) (cid:54)= ηb(t) such that

ηb(t) − ηa(t) =

for any t ≥ 0, since the number of nonzero elements on the
right side of (10) is equal to N . Therefore, there do not exist
di(t) (cid:54)= ¯di(t) such that

then for all Wa(t) ⊂ {1, . . . , N }, with card(Wa(t)) = q and
t ≥ 0, there must exist another set Wb(t) ⊂ {1, . . . , N } with
card(Wb(t)) = q such that Wb(t)∪Wa(t) = {1, . . . , N } since
2q ≥ N . Let Iab(t) = Wa(t) ∩ Wb(t). For all di(t) (cid:54)= ¯di(t)
and t ≥ 0, we choose
ηbi(t) = di(t) − ¯di(t), ηai(t) = 0, i ∈ {Wb(t) \ Iab(t)}
ηbi(t) = 0, ηai(t) = ¯di(t) − di(t), i ∈ {Wa(t) \ Iab(t)}

.

(14)

Remark 2 Assumption 1 allows that all sensors are compro-
mised at some time t ≥ 0, but at each time, attackers only
inject attack signals into less than q sensors. This limitation
may be caused by energy or hardware constraints, or attack
strategy adopted. For instance, an attacker may use a laser
for compromising all the vision sensors at different time, but
at each time, only one single vision sensor may be affected
due to a small beam length of the laser [6]; a radio generator
capable of sending radio signals with different frequencies can
be used to compromise multiple radars at different time, but
only one radar can be affected at each time [32].

Corollary 1 Under Assumption 1, among all N sensors that
measure di, at least N − q of them are attack-free; among
every set of N − q sensors that measure di, at least N − 2q
of them are attack-free

For every subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , N } sensors and t ≥ 0, we deﬁne
ˆdJ (t) as the average value of all the measurements given by
subset J of sensors at time t, as follows:

Under Assumption 1, there exists at least one subset ¯I(t) ⊂
{1, . . . , N } with card( ¯I(t)) = N − q such that η ¯I(t)(t) =
0 for t ≥ 0. Then, the difference between ˆd ¯I(t)(t) and any
Di(t), i ∈ ¯I(t) will be smaller than the other subsets J ⊂
{1, . . . , N } with card(J) = N − q and ηJ (t) (cid:54)= 0, in general.
This motivates the following fusion algorithm.

For every subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , N } of sensors with
card(J) = N − q, deﬁne πJ (t) as the largest difference
between ˆdJ (t) and Di(t) for all i ∈ J, i.e.,

Then, as proved below, the fused measurement indexed by

ˆdi(t) = ˆdσ(t)(t),

(22)

is an attack-free measurement of di(t). The following result
uses the terminology presented above.

If there exists t1 ∈ [iT, (i + 1)T ), i ∈ N such that (32) holds,
we say that sensors are under attack in the i-th time window.
Otherwise, we say sensors are attack-free in this time window.
This detection procedure is formally stated in Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1 Attack Detection.
1: Fix the window size T ∈ N.
2: For i ∈ N, if ∃t1 ∈ [iT, (i + 1)T ) such that (32) holds,

then sensor attacks occur in the i-th window, and

detection(i) = 1;

≤π ¯I (t) + |ν¯i(t)|
≤||ν||∞ + max

Inequality (29) is of the form (23) and the result follows. (cid:4)

otherwise, sensors are attack-free in the i-th window,
and

detection(i) = 0.

3: Return detection(i)

B. Isolation strategy

Remark 4 Note that
this secure sensor fusion scheme is
general enough to be applicable to a large class of CPSs.
For security-critical CPSs, sensor redundancy can be created
for security purposes and then our sensor fusion framework
can be applied to provide robust sensor information in spite
of attacks.

From Section IV, we know that σ(t) ⊂ {1, . . . , N } is a
set of attack-free sensors. For t ≥ 0, we randomly select one
sensor i∗(t) ∈ σ(t) and we have ηi∗(t)(t) = 0. For each i ∈
{1, . . . , N } and t ≥ 0, we compute the difference between
Di(t) and Di∗(t)(t). Then, if the i-th sensor is attack-free,
i.e., ηi(t) = 0, we have

V. DETECTION AND ISOLATION

In this section, we now assume the bounds on each sensor
measurement noise is known to us, i.e., ||νi||∞ for all i ∈
{1, . . . , N } is known. We ﬁrst provide a simple technique for
detecting sensor attacks. Then, we use the fusion algorithm
presented in Section IV to select the attack-free sensors and
isolate the ones that are compromised.

A. Detection strategy

If all the sensors are attack-free at time t, the deviation
and Di(t) for all i ∈ {1, . . . , N } will be

there exists one or more than one sensor i ∈ {1, . . . , N } such
that

(32)

for some t ≥ 0. However, note that it is still possible that
η(t) (cid:54)= 0 for some t ≥ 0 but inequality (30) still holds, which

|Di∗(t)(t) − Di(t)| =|Di∗(t)(t) − di(t) + di(t) − Di(t)|
≤|Di∗(t)(t) − di(t)| + |di(t) − Di(t)|
≤||νi∗(t)||∞ + ||νi||∞.

For each i ∈ {1, . . . , N }, deﬁne

τi(t) (cid:44) ||νi∗(t)||∞ + ||νi||∞.

(33)

(34)

Then for t ≥ 0, the i-th sensor is isolated as an attacked one
if

|Di∗(t)(t) − Di(t)| > τi(t).

(35)

Then, the set of sensors that are isolated as the attacked ones
at time t, which we denote as ˆW (t), is given as

ˆW (t) = (cid:8)i ∈ {1, . . . , N } (cid:12)

(cid:12)|Di∗(t)(t) − Di(t)| > τi(t) (cid:9) .

(36)
Thus, the set {1, . . . , p}\ ˆW (t) is the set of attack-free sensors
at time t.

VI. CONTROL

We have shown that

the error of the proposed fusion
algorithm is bounded independent of attacks. In this section,
we assume that the on-board sensors of each vehicle in the
platoon and the inter-vehicle communication channels are
noisy and each vehicle uses the estimation provided by the
fusion algorithm for control, as shown in Figure 2. The
estimation errors of the fusion algorithm introduce uncertainty
into the system loop and may deteriorate the performance of

designing an H∞ CACC scheme to stabilize its closed-loop
dynamics while minimizing the joint effect of communica-
tion channel noise, sensor noise and estimation errors on
platooning string stability and tracking performance of each
vehicle. Adopting the controller described in [33] that fulﬁlls
the vehicle-following objective and the string stability, we
consider a homogeneous platoon model given in [33] with
hi = h, τi = τ for all i ∈ Sm, and assume that the on-board
sensors of vehicle i that measure relative velocity, relative
acceleration are perturbed by noise ωvi and ωai respectively,
ui−1 is perturbed by channel noise ωui, relative distance
information is provided by the fusion algorithm and hence
perturbed by eσ(t), which is formulated as follows:

||xi−1||∞ is bounded. Since system (42) is ISS with respect

the boundedness of ||xi||∞ for i ∈ Sm. From the fact that

VII. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

Here, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate the

performance of our methods.

Example 1. We consider the i-th vehicle in a platoon is
using 3 LiDARs with different wavelengths for measuring
di and di(t) = 5 + sin(t). Assume measurement noise in
each LiDAR satisfy ν1 ∼ U(−b1, b1), ν2 ∼ U(−b2, b2),
ν3 ∼ U(−b3, b3) with b1 = 0.1, b2 = 0.2, b3 = 0.3, and
we assume b1, b2, b3 are unknown to us. The attacker has 1
radio signal generator capable of generating pulses of various
frequencies to spoof all the 3 LiDARs at different time, and
at each time t, a pulse of a speciﬁc frequency is generated
to spoof one of the corresponding LiDAR sensors with the
same frequency. Denote the attacked LiDAR at time t as
ia(t) ∈ {1, 2, 3} and let ηia(t) ∼ N (0, 52). For t ∈ [1, 20],
the vehicle uses (20)-(22) for fusing the 3 measurements of
di(t). The performance of the fusion algorithm is shown in
Figure 3.

Example 2. We consider the i-th vehicle in a platoon is
using a LiDAR, a millimeter wave radar and an ultrasonic
sensor for measuring di. THe corresponding measurement
noise is ν1 ∼ U(−b1, b1), ν2 ∼ U(−b2, b2), ν3 ∼ U(−b3, b3)
with b1 = 0.1, b2 = 0.4, b3 = 0.5. The values of b1, b2 and b3
are now assumed to be known. Assume the attacker has one
transceiver to generate a pulse to spoof the ultrasonic sensor.
Then, the unknown set of attacked sensors W (k) = {3} is a
constant set and let η3(t) ∼ N (0, 102). Then, ||ν||∞ = 0.5,
and τd1 = 0.6, τd2 = 0.9, τd3 = 1 accordingly. For
t ∈ [1, 1000], we run Algorithm 1 and the result shows that we
have 100% successful detection. For t ∈ [1, 20], (34)-(36) are
used for isolating the attacked sensors. The isolation algorithm
claims sensor 0 is under attack at time t if no attacked sensors
are isolated. The performance of our isolation algorithm is
presented in Figure 4, where it is shown that our algorithm
successfully isolates the ultrasonic sensor as the attacked one
13 out of 20 tests.

with 3 sensors for measuring di for all i ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}.
We let hi = 0.5, τi = 0.1 for all i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
ν1 ∼ U(−0.2, 0.2), ν2 ∼ U(−0.4, 0.4), ν3 ∼ U(−0.6, 0.6),
ωv, ωu ∼ U(−0.1, 0.1), ξ0 = 10m/s2, 0, −10m/s2, 0, in
the time intervals [0, 5], (5, 10], (10, 15], (15, 20] seconds
respectively. Assume at each time t ≥ 0, one of the 3 sensors
of each vehicle is randomly selected to be attacked. Denote
the attacked sensor of vehicle i at time t as ia(t) ∈ {1, 2, 3}
and let ηia(t) ∼ N (0, 52). For all t ≥ 0, the i-th vehicle
i = 2, 3, 4, 5 uses (20)-(22) for fusing measurements of di(t).
We use algorithms 3 and 4 in [40] to design a robust controller
for each vehicle with H∞ gain γ = 1.5235 and kp = 0.8700,
kd = 11.1683, kdd = 0.0009. The performance of the robust
controller is shown in Figures 5-6.

vehicles. We prove that the proposed sensor fusion algorithm
provides a robust estimation of the correct sensor information
provided that less than half of the sensors are corrupted by
attack signals. The estimation is then used to detect and
isolate attacks and stabilize the closed-loop dynamics of each
vehicle. We have provided an H∞ controller for each CACC-
equipped CAV in the platoon to guarantee its closed-loop
stability with reduced joint effects of estimation error, sensor
and communication channel noise on platooning string-stable
behavior and tracking performance of each vehicle. Our sensor
fusion algorithm can be applied to a large class of security-
critical cyber-physical systems.
