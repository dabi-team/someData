on the outcome of Dutch criminal court cases

Abstract

Law enforcement agencies struggle with criminals using to end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
A recent policy paper states: “while encryption is vital and privacy and cyber security must
be protected, that should not come at the expense of wholly precluding law enforcement”.
The main argument is that E2EE hampers attribution and prosecution of criminals who rely
on encrypted communication - ranging from drug syndicates to child sexual abuse material
(CSAM) platforms. This statement - in policy circles dubbed ‘going dark’ - is not yet sup-
ported by empirical evidence. That is why, in our work, we analyse public court data from
the Netherlands to show to what extent law enforcement agencies and the public prosecution
service are impacted by the use of E2EE in bringing cases to court and their outcome. Our
results show that Dutch courts appear to be as successful in convicting oﬀenders who rely on
E2EE as those who do not. Our data does not permit us to draw conclusions on the eﬀect of
E2EE on criminal investigations.

Introduction

Every technology has a bright and a dark side [7]. For example, GPS was designed to guide
missiles to their targets [5]. Civil use was a secondary objective, but now we would be lost
without GPS-based navigation. Mobile phones meet one of the most basic human needs: the
ability to communicate. But drug dealers and their customers also love their phones because they
no longer have to meet in a dark alley to avoid the police.

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is a system that allows mobile phone users to communicate with
each other without anyone else eavesdropping. So, the police cannot listen in either, even if they are
authorized to tap the communication. PGP was the ﬁrst widely used implementation of E2EE [14],
and WhatsApp has been oﬀering E2EE since April 2016 to over a billion users [10]. PGP has
helped human rights organizations and journalists to communicate in hostile environments. PGP
has probably saved hundreds of lives in the Kosovo theatre Letters from human rights groups.
But oﬀenders use PGP phones [11] to defeat lawful interception. A PGP phone is a relatively
expensive product on which not only PGP is installed, but from which also all non-essential hard
and software have been removed [6].

The content of the communication may be encrypted, but the location of the phones is not.
Every PGP phone has a regular phone number and uses the same mobile phone network as
all other mobile phones. Suppose PGP phone A sends a message to PGP phone B. Then the
encrypted message ﬁrst goes to a cell tower near A, then via the network of the Telco to a cell
tower near B, and ﬁnally from the cell tower to B. The police can locate a PGP phone by asking
the provider when and with which cell towers the phone was in contact. Location information
has been successfully used in several lawsuits to breach the anonymity of PGP phone users. For
example, a court judgment describes how cell tower data proved that the telephones of an oﬀender
and his co-oﬀender travelled together from Eindhoven to Amsterdam, where both were stopped

during a traﬃc control ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2016:2835. Law enforcement has other special powers
to bring oﬀenders to justice that we will discuss below.

So, all these technologies have two sides, but to what extent does the dark side have the upper
hand? We probably agree that navigation with GPS and communication with a mobile phone
has so many advantages that we accept the disadvantages. But do the advantages of E2EE also
outweigh the disadvantages?

E2EE only works properly if it is correctly implemented in a trustworthy execution environment

and if the private keys remain secret. However, this is more easily said than done.

In recent law enforcement operations against criminal service providers such as Phantom Se-
cure, IronChat, Ennetcom, EncroChat, and Sky ECC, the police have managed to obtain messages
- e.g., by inﬁltration - whereas the companies claimed that this should be impossible. The police
were legally allowed to take action against these criminal service providers since there was a well-
founded suspicion that these companies provided services to criminals. For example, Phantom
Secure was a Canadian company that was inﬁltrated by FBI employees in 2018. Recorded con-
versations with the Phantom Secure CEO led to a valid allegation that the company’s modiﬁed
Blackberry phones were used for drug traﬃcking [6]. Oﬀenders not only use PGP, but they also
use WhatsApp. For example: “The fact that the oﬀender sold these drugs came to light after four
young adults became unwell from drugs they had bought after WhatsApp contact with a dealer”
ECLI:NL:RBNNE:2018:5197.

Oﬀenders use PGP and WhatsApp for diﬀerent reasons. Most users probably know that
WhatsApp oﬀers E2EE, but they do not seem to care about it [1]. WhatsApp is a success because
almost all the people you want to communicate with are already using it - i.e., the network eﬀect.
WhatsApp is easy to use, free and even ad-free. PGP phones on the other hand, are an expensive
niche product. The users buy such a device because the conﬁdentiality of the messages they
exchange with it is of vital importance to them. Specialised companies sell PGP phones and
service subscriptions at premium prices. Oﬀenders might use WhatsApp to communicate with
clients or victims, but they might use a PGP-phone to communicate with co-oﬀenders.

In the Netherlands, several Ennetcom court cases have now been concluded, and some of the
court judgments have been made public as open data. To gain insight into the impact of E2EE
on the outcome of Dutch criminal court cases, we will analyse these and other relevant court
judgments.

2 Background and research questions

In the Netherlands, law enforcement has a wide range of special powers at their disposal, as
described in Article 126 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The application of these powers
is subject to strict rules.
In particular, special powers may only be used for serious oﬀences,
and permission from the examining magistrate is required. It should also be possible to check
afterwards whether the powers have been used correctly. These checks and balances are in place
to ensure a fair trial. Technical special powers that are often used in investigations where the
oﬀender tries to evade detection through technology are (1) reading out and analysing conﬁscated
smartphones, (2) placing telephone or Internet taps, (3) obtaining cell tower data from a Telco
to trace the location of a mobile phone, and (4) hacking the computer or another device of
the oﬀender. There are other special powers, such as a subpoena for ﬁnancial data, systematic
observation, and systematic gathering of information, but we will not consider these here since
they are not speciﬁcally designed to deal with technology such as E2EE. We will describe in more
detail below two often-used special powers that on the one hand suﬀer from encryption, but on
the other hand provide useful data.

Phone data Most modern devices have encryption turned on by default. This means, that data
on seized devices can only be read out if the device owner supplies the passcode. Law enforcement
has several options to obtain phone data.

2

• The owner may surrender the passcode to the police. This should not be done under duress
because, in most countries, as the oﬀender should not be obliged to cooperate with his
conviction (nemo tenetur) [11].

• In some countries, the police may force one to give up a ﬁngerprint to unlock a smartphone [6].
• In some cases, special tools can bypass the passcode. For example, to crack the San
Bernardino terrorist’s iPhone 5C, the FBI had to pay more than $ 1M to a specialist com-
pany [4].

• With the permission of the examining magistrate, the police may install key logger malware
on a smartphone. The key logger reports the passcode without the suspect knowing [3].

Server data Lawful interception allows authorised law enforcement agencies to obtain com-
munication network data from individual subscribers. The signalling and network management
information will be clear text, for example, IP addresses. The contents of the data can be en-
crypted, for example, when HTTPS or E2EE is used. In almost all implementations of E2EE,
devices communicate with each other through a server. Law enforcement has several options to
obtain server data:

• If the server contains a bug, an exploit can be used to tap the communication. This has

happened to WhatsApp.

• If the administrators of the server make mistakes, the server can be hacked. This has

happened to EncroChat.

• If the administrators of the server are issued a subpoena by the court to hand over data

from speciﬁc customers, they will have to comply. This has happened to HushMail.

• If law enforcement can pose as a reseller of handsets, they can insert a backdoor into the
handset before delivering them to the customer. This has allegedly happened to Sky ECC.
• The police can also take the servers down and arrest the owners. This has happened to

Phantom secure.

Research questions The law ensures that an oﬀender is only convicted if all evidence is legally
obtained and conclusive. Suppose, that the content of a message from an oﬀender is encrypted.
The court may still be able to see to whom the oﬀender has sent the message, but the court does
not learn the content of the message. Then, the message could be legal evidence, but the court will
probably deem it inconclusive. Also, assume that there is no other evidence, just the encrypted
message. Then, all cases where the oﬀender has used E2EE will lack conclusive evidence and are
either not brought to court or lead to an acquittal by the court. This is a hypothetical situation,
as there may be enough other evidence to convict the oﬀender, for example, location data. It does
not matter whether the oﬀender has used a PGP phone or WhatsApp, because in both cases,
the phone must communicate regularly with a cell tower. The Telco therefore knows the location
of the phone in question. And, with the location data obtained from the Telco, the court may
decide that the evidence is conclusive. Because E2EE may reduce the number of options that law
enforcement has to collect legal and convincing evidence, our ﬁrst research question is: To what
extent does law enforcement use its special powers when oﬀenders resort to E2EE? (RQ1)

Cases for which the police cannot obtain suﬃcient evidence are normally not tried in court. We
have made inquiries at the Netherlands Forensic Institute, but unfortunately, no public data or
statistics are available on these types of cases. Our analysis is, therefore, limited to cases brought
to the courts. Because acquittal can be a consequence of the use of E2EE, our second research
question is: To what extent are oﬀenders using E2EE acquitted? (RQ2)

A court judgment is a decision about the oﬀender. However, a judgment also contains infor-
mation about other persons involved in an investigation, such as co-oﬀenders but also unknown
persons with a criminal role. If unknown persons appear more often in E2EE investigations, this
could be an indication that E2EE hinders the work of the police. E2EE use can lead to a lack
of evidence, but it is usually not the only cause. For example: “Because entering the oﬀender’s
home was unlawful, the objects found may not be used as evidence. Because there is no other
evidence, in this case, the oﬀender is acquitted” ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2020:4884. We could investi-

3

gate the occurrence of unknown persons in our three groups, which would shed more light on the
problem caused by E2EE. Instead, we decided to zoom in onto the PGP group – as this group
represents a worst case for law enforcement – and focus on a potential solution: the capture by
law enforcement of server or phone data from criminal service providers. We pose as the third
research question: To what extent do unknown persons occur in investigations using data from
criminal service providers. (RQ3)

3 Method

In six years (2015 - 2020), the Dutch district courts published 25,366 anonymized court judgments
on rechtspraak.nl. This represents about 5% of the total number of court judgments in that period.
The courts publish all judgments with a crime against life, where the maximum sentence is at least
four years, or when the court expects interest from the public. Therefore, judgments of the most
serious crimes are likely to be included in the published data set.

Oﬀenders and the police are engaged in an on-going battle. As soon as one wins, the other
tries to nullify that lead. E2EE gives the oﬀender a head start, and the question is to what extent
the special powers of the police can cope. We will therefore construct a comparison group of
judgments in which the police used their special powers, but in which the oﬀender did not use
E2EE. These judgments form a baseline for judgments in which the oﬀender has used E2EE.

To answer RQ1, we will compare the group of judgments where the oﬀender has used E2EE to
the comparison group. To answer RQ2, we will compare the conviction rates of the three groups.
To analyse the court judgments, we deﬁne three variables as follows:

• The ﬁrst variable special power encodes the technical special powers used by law enforcement

in reaction to the oﬀender using E2EE.

• The second variable decision encodes whether the oﬀender is convicted or acquitted.
• The third variable technology encodes whether the oﬀender used PGP, WhatsApp, or neither
(comparison). A judgment with both WhatsApp and PGP is considered a PGP judgment;
the three groups are therefore independent.

To answer RQ3, we will identify judgments that mention unknown persons in a criminal role as
a proxy for potential co-oﬀenders who have not been tried due to lack of evidence. We assume, that
such unknown persons have stayed anonymous, because they used PGP. The analysis is therefore
worst-case because every potential oﬀender who has not been prosecuted is blamed on the use of
PGP. The unit of assessment for RQ3 is therefore the investigation, rather than the judgment as
for RQ1 and RQ2. An investigation is deﬁned as the set of judgments originating from the same
police investigation. To analyse the police investigations, we deﬁne two variables: data and others.
The ﬁrst variable data encodes whether or not law enforcement has used data from a criminal
service provider. There are two possibilities:

• Server data has been obtained from criminal service providers, such as Ennetcom, EncroChat,

PGP-safe, Sky-ECC, and IronChat, or from police operations Onymous and Bayonet.

• The PGP phone of the oﬀender has been read out or his PGP keys were seized.

The second variable others encodes whether unknown persons played a criminal role in the in-
vestigation. This can be stated in many ways, for example: “The oﬀender is a career crim-
inal of the worst kind who lives in circles where liquidation orders are given and received”
ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2017:5136. We have also looked for judgments stating that the case against
one of the co-oﬀenders has been dropped. However, this does not occur in the PGP judgments.

Descriptive statistics A total of 6,619 relevant court judgments were available for analysis.
This is about 1.5% of the total number of criminal judgments processed by the Dutch district
courts in the given 6-year period. In 439 judgments PGP was used, WhatsApp was used in 2,390
judgments, and the comparison group consists of 3,790 judgments. The groups are unbalanced,
which weakens some of the statistical analysis. We sampled 20% of the WhatsApp group and 12%
of the comparison group (both uniform and at random). This gave us a WhatsApp group of 437
judgments and a comparison group of 469 judgments, in total N=1,345.

Of the 1,345 judgments, 25.5% were drugs-related, and 26.6% were violence-related. These
percentages are higher than the national averages of 9.7% and 9.2% respectively [9, Table 6.2 and
6.12] because the courts mainly publish judgments of serious crimes.

The oﬀender is female in 7.9% of judgments. The average age of the oﬀender at the time of
the court judgment is 36.2 (SD = 12.5) years. Of the oﬀenders, 37.9% are ﬁrst-time oﬀenders,
and 31.5% are repeat oﬀenders. These demographics are consistent with the demographics of the
whole population of Dutch criminal oﬀenders convicted for serious crime [12].

Of the 1,345 judgments, 80.0% have resulted in incarceration, including involuntary commit-
ment, imprisonment, and military detention. The average length of incarceration is 42.7 (SD =
50.0) months, which is more than 10 times the national average of 4 months [9, Table 6.11], again
because of the focus on serious crime. Community service represents 5.2%, acquittal 6.3%, and a
ﬁne 3.0%. The remaining 4.7% of the judgments are procedural, such as an extradition request.
The police have used their technical special powers as follows: In 68.0% of judgments, a phone
or Internet connection was tapped (oﬀenders with a PGP-phone may also have a regular phone).
In 26.9% of judgments, a seized mobile phone was read out. In 10.9% of judgments, a phone was
located by requesting cell tower data. The Dutch police have hacked into the oﬀender’s systems
eight times in 2019, just after passing the relevant law that made this possible. However, none of
those judgments are public (yet), so that we have no data on police hacks.

The 439 PGP judgments are the result of 196 criminal investigations. In the majority of these

(83.3%), law enforcement used server or phone data from criminal service providers.

4 Results

Table 1 tabulates the crime rates for the main oﬀence types deﬁned by Statistics Netherlands
cbs.nl. Other criminal oﬀence includes oﬀences not covered by any of the other categories, for
example, road traﬃc oﬀences, and environmental crime. Sometimes procedural judgments are not
tied to a speciﬁc oﬀence, for instance, extraditions. The “Other” column also accounts for these
procedural judgments. An oﬀender may commit more than one crime, but we have counted only
the oﬀence with the most severe maximum sentence. A χ2 test of association between technology
and oﬀence type was found to be statistically signiﬁcant (see caption). This means, that the
diﬀerence in crime rates between the three groups is unlikely to exist due to chance. For example,
oﬀenders using WhatsApp commit mostly violent crime (41.6%), whereas PGP oﬀenders mostly
commit drugs-related oﬀences (53.1%).

Table 2 shows the relationship between the variables technology and special power. The police
prefer the tap (47.3%) to reading out phones (22.2%) and gathering cell tower data (10.9%). By the
construction of the comparison group, special powers were used in all comparison judgments. A χ2
test of association between technology and special power was found to be statistically signiﬁcant

(see caption). This means, that the diﬀerence in the use of special powers between the three
groups is unlikely to exist due to chance. For example, the police use special powers more for
PGP (100-19.8=80.2%) than for WhatsApp (100-40.5=59.5%) judgments.

Table 3 shows the relationship between the variables technology and decision. To focus on the
diﬀerences between conviction and acquittal, we have omitted the procedural judgments; hence
the total number is 1,282 instead of 1,345. In all three groups, the vast majority of oﬀenders is
convicted. A χ2 test of association did not reveal a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the conviction
rates of the three groups (see caption). This means, that there is no evidence in our data that the
outcome of a trial depends on whether the oﬀender used PGP, WhatsApp or neither.

Table table 4 shows the relationship between the variables data and others. The 439 judgments
constitute 196 investigations. In 36.7% of the investigations, criminal service provider data was
used, and in 61.2% unknown persons were involved. A χ2 test showed that there is no signiﬁcant
relationship between the variables. This means, that there is no evidence in our data that the
availability of server or phone data inﬂuences the number of investigations with unknown others.

5 Discussion

Research questions The answer to RQ1 is that law enforcement uses more special powers in
cases where oﬀenders use PGP than where they use WhatsApp. This places a burden on law
enforcement and ultimately on the taxpayer. However, law enforcement does not use all its special
powers, and it does not use special powers for all investigations either. This can be explained
by assuming that in a PGP investigation, a mere Internet tap would not provide enough data to

create conclusive evidence. This suggests, that law enforcement has more special powers than it
currently uses.

The answer to RQ2 is that there is no evidence in our dataset that the conviction rate of
oﬀenders who use EE2E diﬀers from the conviction rate of oﬀenders who do not use EE2E. This
means, that our data shows no evidence that the outcome of court decisions is inﬂuenced by E2EE.
The answer to RQ3 is that the data available to us shows no diﬀerence in the extent to which
unknown persons are criminally involved in investigations with, or without, data from criminal
service providers. This means, that our data shows no evidence that capturing data from criminal
service providers inﬂuences the number of unknown persons with a criminal role. However, our
data does show that the majority of police investigations into PGP cases (83.3%) use criminal
service provider data or phone read outs.

Public-policy debate We provide some observations as a contribution to the public-policy
debate [8].

Some courts seem to hint towards legislative action against criminal use of E2EE, as evidenced
by phrases from court judgments such as: “This crypto phone belongs to the accused and is
of such a nature that its uncontrolled possession is contrary to the law or the public interest.”
ECLI:NL:RBZWB:2020:1216. What the courts have probably not considered is whether control-
ling possession is feasible. If the legislator restricts the use of EE2E, the authorities would have
to verify that all service providers duly implement the restrictions. We think that this would be
a heavier burden on governments (and on the taxpayer) than the status quo.

Next to the burden of additional police costs to work around E2EE, there are other interests
too [13]. For example, national security agencies are unlikely to use backdoor encryption because
of the risk of the key to the back door ending up in the wrong hands. And conﬁdentiality is
crucial for national security agencies. Also, the commercial use of E2EE with a back door would
probably not be viable because of the risk that a competitor would get hold of the keys. This
means, that many legitimate users of E2EE will ﬁnd alternative means of secure communication
that law enforcement will not be able to tap, thus aggravating the problem for law enforcement
rather than ameliorating it.

If E2EE is weakened - or in essence, broken - by policies that demand a back door, a supra-
national infrastructure is needed to manage those backdoors. Every nation-state will need to
access backdoors to prosecute its nationals, including states on the EU sanctions list. We believe,
that this is a recipe for disaster. Banning E2EE will simply force terrorists, drug dealers, and
paedophile rings to use alternative technologies. Well-funded oﬀenders are already starting to
develop their own encryption platforms MPC. Initially, such tools will have issues, but over time
they will get better and will create an obstacle to law enforcement.

Law enforcement currently does an excellent job of taking down criminal service providers
like EncroChat. Recent law enforcement operations against these companies show that there are
suﬃcient opportunities to monitor them and to act upon information that shows their involvement
in illegal activity. Our recommendation is not to build a back door into every application of E2EE,
but to keep a watchful eye on relevant, criminal service providers.

7

Limitations Our analysis is focused on PGP and WhatsApp, as only nine judgments mention
Signal and two mention Telegram [2]. The most importantly limitation is that we do not know
when special powers have proven insuﬃcient for law enforcement to build a case because such
information is conﬁdential.
Instead, we have used acquittal by the courts as an indication of
inconclusive evidence. The data we have used stems from the Dutch government and is not
necessarily representative of other countries. The data also only represents about 1.5% of all
criminal judgments in the Netherlands.

6 Conclusions

The criminal justice system is often described as a funnel that inputs many more crime reports
than that it outputs convicted oﬀenders [7]. Few crime reports lead to a police investigation, and
even fewer investigations lead to a court case. The court judgments that we have been able to
analyse make the convictions transparent but the rest of the funnel remains opaque. However, by
searching for criminal roles played by unknown others, we have tried to see beyond convictions,
and into the investigations.

The information position of technology companies and governments today is superior to that
of the nineties due to surveillance from online and oﬄine sources. Encryption is one of the few
technologies available to law-abiding citizens, corporations, and national security agencies that
protect privacy. Yet, criminals (mis)use that same technology.

We have shown that the courts in a democracy with suﬃcient checks and balances can do its
work without legislation that breaks encryption. We cannot make a similar conclusion for law
enforcement as our data is inconclusive on this point. One way to gain insight into this problem
is by examining police ﬁles and interviewing police detectives. This we suggest as future work.
