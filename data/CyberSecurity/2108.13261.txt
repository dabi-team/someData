Abstract.  Data  centres  are  experiencing  significant  growth  in  their  scale,  especially,  with  the  ever-
increasing  demand  for  cloud  and  IoT  ser-  vices.  However,  this  rapid  growth  has  raised  numerous 
security issues and vulnerabilities; new types of strategic cyber-attacks are aimed at specific physical 
components  of  data  centres  that  keep  them  operating.  Attacks against temperature monitoring and 
cooling systems of data centres, also known as thermal attacks, can cause a complete meltdown and are 
generally considered difficult to address. In this paper, we focus on this issue by analysing the potential 
security threats to these systems and their impact on the overall data center safety and performance. We 
also  present  current  thermal  anomaly  detection methods  and  their  limitations.  Finally,  we propose a 
hybrid method that uses multi-variant anomaly detection to prevent thermal attacks, as well as a fuzzy-
based health factor to enhance data center thermal awareness and security.

Introduction 

Data Centres are experiencing unprecedented growth and will continue to scale operations to meet 
the ever-increasing service demands. A recent study by Gartner1 estimated that about 425 million new 
servers might be needed by 2020 to support 30 billion connected IoT devices around the world, while 
the average data centre will support more than 100,000 servers [30]. The average data warehouse 
size usually ranges from 100ft2 to 400,000ft2 [35] and operates on a high-  power  consumption.  A 
plethora  of  security  issues  has  arisen  due  to  this  rapid  growth, causing data centres to become 
vulnerable  to  strategic  cyber-attacks  on  the  physical  infrastructure  vital  to  maintaining  the 
uninterrupted operation of data centres [12, 13, 19, 39]. Power supply, cooling, temperature monitoring 
and  even security systems can serve as entry points for attacks against data centre operators  or 
companies using data centre services. Security experts warn that ne sophisticated malware such as 
Triton  and  Trisis  [28]  are  very  effective  against  power  and  HVAC  (Heating,  Ventilating,  and  Air 
Conditioning) systems, and therefore,  put  data  centres’  safety  at  risk.  Moreover,  reported  cyber-
incidents showed that cyber-attacks on such connected facilities can destroy thousands of servers 
by overheating the environmental atmosphere, or manipulating energy and temperature settings to 
cause a fire or an explosion incident [12, 13, 39]. Attacks against temperature monitoring and cooling 
systems, also known as thermal attacks, are considered dangerous and difficult to tackle. 

In this paper, we aim to address this issue by exploring the most important security threats against 
thermal  management  systems,  as  well  as  their  overall  impact  on  data  centre  security  and 
performance.  In  this  context,  we  describe  a  number  of  vulnerabilities  that  may  be  exploited  by 
attackers who want to affect environmental conditions inside a data centre. Based on a combination 
of thermal hardware requirements, thermal anomaly detection is considered a relevant approach for 
detecting abnormal behaviour of data centre indoor temperature. In this context, several approaches

have been proposed for temperature measurement analysis and abnormal behaviour definition of 
various environments such as smart homes, health, and data centres. In this paper, we analyse the 
effectiveness  and  limitations  of  these  approaches  with  respect  to  the  protection  against  thermal 
attacks in data centres. Additionally, we denote the importance of intelligent solutions and propose 
a hybrid framework that uses multi-variant anomaly detection as a preventive measure. Finally, to 
further enhance thermal awareness and security of data centres, we introduce a fuzzy-based health 
factor. 

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In section 2, a high-level overview of temperature 
monitoring in large data centres is presented, along with their importance and benefits. Section 3 
discusses the potential security threats on temperature monitoring systems and their impact on the 
overall data centre security and performance. In Section 4, we provide an overview of the existing 
solutions  and  their  limitations.  Section  5  outlines  the  effectiveness  of  combining  multi-variate 
anomaly  detection  methods  and  fuzzy  logic  in  protecting  data  centres  against  thermal  attacks. 
Finally, section 6 concludes this paper and outlines future work. 

2  Thermal management in data centres 

Data centres are large infrastructures composed of a building or a group of buildings dedicated to 
housing computer systems and their services [13]. They usually host a large number of high-density 
servers, that are run simultaneously and generate an extensive amount of heat every second. Thus, 
existing data centres are equipped with multiple cooling technologies to cool down servers, including 
chilled water systems, cold aisle/hot aisle design, Computer Room Air Conditioner (CRAC), liquid 
cooling and free air cooling [12, 32]. For efficient thermal management, they also use robust thermal 
design  and  temperature  regulation  and  monitoring  as  heat  countermeasures.  In  modern  data 
centres,  HVAC  and  CRAC  systems  are  the  most  widely  used  cooling  solution  for  managing 
temperature,  airflow  and  humidity,  while  continuous  monitoring  with  Wireless  thermal  sensor 
networks (WSNs) helps to create and maintain the energy-efficient cooling environment. 

As shown in Figure 1, computer rooms of the data centre are arranged into hot and cold aisles; server 
rack fronts face each other to create cold aisles due to the front-to-back heat produced by servers 
[32]. CRAC units, which are usually positioned at the end of hot-aisles or around the room perimeter 
(see Figure 1) push the cold air under the raised floor and through the cold aisle to absorb the heat 
produced by servers. The resulting hot air enters the hot aisle from the front side of the server racks 
and is returned to the CRAC devices to cool down by the chillers once more [12, 13, 32]. In order to 
avoid overheating, the inlet temperatures of servers are continuously monitored using a network of 
thermal sensors. If the inlet temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, parts of servers or even 
racks are forced to shut down to avoid permanent hardware damage [12]. 

   
 
Fig. 1. Typical cooling system in data centres [11]. 

In general, control and monitoring of heat diffusion inside a data center is a complicated process that 
involves  rack  positioning  design,  air  flow  simulations  and  monitoring  devices  distribution.  The 
American  Society  of  Heating,  Refrigerating  and  Air-Conditioning  Engineers  (ASHRAE)  supplies 
detailed  suggestions  for  temperature  readings  and  defines  three  models  regarding  placing 
temperature sensors: a) managing the space, b) setting up the space, and c) troubleshooting the 
space.  More  specifically,  it  suggests  that  temperature  should  be  measured  at  every  fourth  rack 
position in the center of cold aisles. Additionally, temperature measurement should be taken at the 
center of the air intakes of the top, middle, and bottom equipment mounted in a particular rack [33]. 
Temperature monitoring is not only effective against equipment protection, but it is also an efficient 
measure  to  cut  costs.  In  2013,  a  study  by  the  U.S.  General  Services  Administration  proposed  a 
temperature of 22°C – 26°C as the ideal temperature range for data centres. The same study claimed 
savings  of  about  4-5%  in  energy  costs  from  every  1°C  of  temperature  increase  [36].  Overall, 
temperature  monitoring  provides  numerous  advantages  to  data  centre  managers,  offering  energy 
use optimisation, optimal heat distribution, and thermal overload avoidance among others. 

3  Security threats and their impact 

Data centres play an increasingly important role in modern society and digital economy, however; 
their security is still a challenging area with many open problems. The increasing reliance on these 
digital infrastructures to accommodate large volumes of valuable information make them prone to 
strategic attacks. In this context, many studies showed that most data centres and their associated 
building automation systems have little or no protection policies in place [8, 12, 13, 19]. Further, a 
recent  report  by  CyrusOne2  confirmed  that  its  New  York  data  centre  was  attacked  by  the  REvil 
ransomware, also known as Sodinokibi, affecting more than six customer companies of CyrusOne 
[20]. Another report by Verizon found that DDoS attacks and privilege misuse were the most common 
attack  vectors  in  last  year’s  cyber-attacks  against  data  centres,  mainly  due  to  the  proliferation  of 
poorly secured connected IoT devices [21].

The temperature monitoring system, which is one of the most critical components of a data centre, 
is vulnerable to cyber-attacks too [12, 19]. Temperature monitoring is usually guaranteed through 
hundreds or even thousands of temperature sensors (i.e., Thermal sensors) that form a WSN, which 
can then be remotely controlled and configured. Thus, malicious cyber actors can easily take control 
of  the  network  and  manipulate  the  thermal  conditions  of  a  specific  server  or  rack;  for  example, 
maintaining servers in a relatively hot environment [12, 13]. To achieve their goals, attackers will run 
thermal-intensive workloads into victim servers or VMs (Virtual Machines) to rapidly generate large 
amounts  of  heat.  This  heat  will  consequently  worsen  the  thermal  condition  of  the  peripheral 
environment, and therefore raise the inlet temperature of other servers [12, 14]. What’s more, such 
networks are vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks due to several restrictions, such as low capability 
of  computation,  small  memory  size,  limited  resources  of  energy  and  unreliable  communication 
channels [31]. Overall, these insecure devices can be easily compromised in order to remotely launch 
attacks against the temperature monitoring system. 

The adversary who launches a thermal attack can be an individual hacker, a competing provider, or 
a specialised organisation for committing cyber-crime. A study by [34] showed that thermal attacks 
can also come from insider malicious tenants, especially in the case of multi-tenant data centres. In 
this case, malicious tenants can inject additional thermal loads, exceeding the shared cooling system 
capacity, which can lead to overheating and possible system downtime. It is clear that the impact of 
thermal  attacks  is  not  limited  to  victim  servers,  but  it  can  also  affect  surrounding  environmental 
temperature, which, in turn, can impact thermal conditions of other servers and the entire data centre 
[14].  In  the  same  context,  a  study  by  [12]  found  that  a  successful  thermal  attack  targeting  2%  of 
servers  in  a  data  centre  can  dramatically  affect  the  thermal  conditions  of  the  whole  data  centre. 
Similarly,  affecting  thermal  conditions  of  adjacent  servers  and  causing  local  hotspots  would 
significantly  raise  cooling  costs,  or  lead  to  a  cooling  breakdown.  Taking  these  studies  into 
consideration, it has  been  well-proved that thermal  attacks can highly decrease  performance and 
reliability of victim servers by largely increasing their temperature. 

One of the main reasons that renders data centres vulnerable to thermal attacks is the extensive use 
of  aggressive  cooling  and  power  management  policies  such  as  power  oversubscription  [12,  39]. 
Power  oversubscription  allows  more  servers  to  be  hosted  on  a  single  data  centre’s  power 
infrastructure than it can actually support [12]. Implementations of power oversubscription can lead 
to  severe  security  gaps,  e.g,  malicious  attackers  can  manipulate  many  servers  to  create  a  local 
hotspot or generate simultaneous power peaks to violate the power capacity in the data centre [39]. 
Another reason is that thermal attacks try to intentionally keep the outlet temperature of victim servers 
at a high level, which makes chip-level temperature sensors, used in more modern servers, incapable 
of monitoring the temperature at the server- and data centre-level. These sensors can only provide 
information  about  the  server’s  core  temperature  which  is  not  equal  to  the  inlet  and  outlet 
temperatures, and therefore, cannot prevent the occurrence of local hotspots [12]. 

Current  anomaly  detection  approaches  in  data  centre  temperature  monitoring  have  many 
weaknesses and are not effective in preventing thermal attacks [12, 25]. For instance, most of these 
approaches are not capable of distinguishing between benign thermal-intensive workloads and the 
malicious  ones,  as  several  thermal-intensive  incidents  are  benign  and  do  not  exploit  security 
vulnerabilities  [12].  Furthermore,  a  study  by  [13]  demonstrated  that  existing  anomaly  detection 
approaches  cannot  defend  against  data  centre-level  thermal  attacks,  where  a  large  number  of 
accounts run different workloads simultaneously. 

   
4  Thermal anomaly detection in data centres 

Anomaly  detection  is  a  relevant  approach  in  the  problem  of  temperature  monitoring  inside  data 
centres because it allows  data centre managers to  identify behaviour that  deviates from “normal” 
system  behaviour  in  a  proactive  manner.  In  general,  thermal  anomaly  detection  is  based  on  a 
combination  of  thermal  hardware  requirements,  that  have  been  applied  to  cooling  systems,  and 
historical  observations,  that  are  recorded  and/or  streamed  by  environmental  sensors  inside  the 
critical  infrastructure.  Several  researchers  have  suggested  anomaly  detection  methods  for 
temperature  data  in  a  variety  of  environments.  Initially,  and  in  an  attempt  to  detect  possible  risk 
events inside a household, an anomaly detection method was applied to smart home data by [18] 
through  temporal  data  mining.  For  their  investigation,  researchers  used  sensors  to  measure 
temperature,  humidity,  light,  etc.  The  model  looked  for  temporal  interactions  among  frequent 
activities to learn “resident” behaviour and reported as “unusual” events with low probability. Despite 
using a combination of real and synthetic data, the method proved effective, but was not used to 
perform predictions [18]. 

Deviations  from  historical  patterns  were  also  examined  in  environmental  data  in  [15].  The  study 
presented an anomaly detection method, using a data-driven univariate auto-regressive model and 
a  moving  window  to  predict  the  next  measurement  based  on  historical  data.  The  method,  which 
employed  sensors  reporting  through  telemetry,  performed  well  without  requiring  previous 
classification of data, and proved applicable to larger data sets as well [15]. In their extensive study, 
[6]  proposed  a  spatiotemporal  correlation  to  detect  anomalies  from  sensor  nodes,  such  as 
temperature,  humidity  and  light,  in  wireless  sensor  networks.  Even  though  this  method  aimed  to 
reduce  energy  and  spectrum  consumption,  the  information-gain  from  aggregate  neighbourhood 
sensor data can prove critical in high-risk cases where temperature variations need to be addressed 
immediately.  In  an  attempt  to  ensure  healthy  operating  conditions  and  ensure  reliability  for  High-
Performance  Computing  systems  (HPC)  and  data  centres,  [5]  used  autoencoders  to  train  data 
collected from monitoring devices mounted on computing nodes. Their method used metrics such as 
core load, power consumption, room temperature, GPU usage, cooling fans speed, etc., and was 
able to catch anomalies when tested on real tier-1 HPC systems. 

Despite the fact that temperature was not one of the monitoring values, re- search conducted by [1, 
16] demonstrated the use of anomaly detection in critical infrastructure. On one hand, [16] presented 
an analysis of multi-variate anomaly detection methods to assist in condition-based maintenance. 
Their approach included an application on real aircraft turbofan engine data, where their model was 
able to successfully detect anomalies and recognise failing factors. On the other hand, [1] proposed 
a multi-agent swarm system to detect abnormal be- haviour in cloud data centres. Nevertheless, both 
frameworks did not consider data collection from the surrounding environment for their evaluation, 
but rather focused on the system’s parameters instead. 

The study of thermal anomaly detection specifically designed for a data centre environment has only 
started to gain attention during the last decade, where there has been a significant development of 
data warehouses around the globe. Studies published by Marwah et al. [25, 26, 27] in 2009-10 were 
the  first  to  ad-  dress  the  issue  of  autonomous  anomaly  detection  of  temperature  values  in  data 
centres  and  apply  machine  learning  on  sensor  data  sets.  In  their  first  paper  on  the  topic,  [27] 
underlined the importance for an autonomous system that is able to catch temperature values beyond 
a certain threshold. They also listed common technical reasons, as well as their symptoms, that lead 
to anomalies. As they state, most of these anomalies can go undetected by traditional systems, while 
they  demonstrate  how  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  can  assist  as  the  primary  detection 
mechanism.  

 
 
 
 
 
In  [25],  they  extended  their  initial  hypothesis  by  introducing  four  detection  mechanisms.  More 
specifically, they compared a simple threshold method, a moving average method, an Exponentially 
Weighed Moving Average (EWMA) method and naive Bayes to predict thermal outliers on a three-
month data set.  Naive Bayes outperformed the other  models and was  able to predict  18% of the 
anomalies at an average of 12 minutes before occurrence. Next, in [26], they used hierarchical PCA 
for real-time detection, which resulted in a 98% accuracy of predicting anomalous cases. What is 
more,  the  method  was  applied  to  data  coming  from  a  part  of  the  data  centre  where  traditional 
methods would not be able to raise an alarm. 

In [40], researchers introduced a sophisticated two-tier hierarchical neural network framework that 
detected  server-level  as  well  as  data  centre-level  thermal  anomalies.  The  method  was  able  to 
achieve this by studying the relationships of heterogeneous sensors and consequently outperform 
other machine learning models. After extensive research on thermal maps for data centres, [22, 23] 
pro-  posed  a  novel  anomaly  detection  method  that  compares  and  maximizes  the  accuracy  of 
constructed and observed maps to detect Regions of Interest (RoIs). The method, which was notably 
based on thermal cameras and traditional temperature monitoring devices, demonstrated sufficient 
accuracy in anomalous cases. Later, and responding to the growing need for fast online detection of 
fault cases, [3, 41] introduced the use of Self-Organizing Maps and reputation systems. 

In another study published in  2016, [4] presented a sophisticated four-step tool  based  on  density 
estimation  for  anomaly  detection  and  data  exploration,  which  was  specifically  designed  for  HPC 
sensors. Even though this method was tested and performed well on a real HPC environment, it was 
not  designed  for  real-time  detection,  an  approach  that  recent  studies  tend  to  follow.  [24]  focused 
exclusively on temperature data when they used naive ensembles to detect anomalies in the cooling 
system of data centres. Nevertheless, because of its theoretical approach, their method needs to be 
extended to demonstrate sufficient performance on non-simulated scenarios. During the same year, 
another  study  published  by  [9]  proposed  an  architecture  sensing  scheme.  According  to  it,  heat 
sensors collect server temperature data and transmit them to the cloud for further analysis. Later in 
2018, [7] tested several  machine learning models on server temperature data to examine cooling 
reliability of data centres. By constructing workload-independent cooling profiles servers, they were 
also  able  to  detect  both  transient  and  lasting  cooling  failures  of  servers.  Two  extensive  studies 
published by [17, 42] in 2019, deployed machine learning to detect fault operations of HVAC systems 
in data centres. In [42], researchers recognising the importance of air-cooling systems in data centres 
introduced a hybrid approach for four- fault decoupling features, including compressor valve leakage, 
condenser fouling, evaporator airflow reduction, and  liquid line restriction. Data  were manipulated 
using the random forest algorithm, which proved rather effective in fault events diagnosis. Lastly and 
for  the  same  reason,  in  [17],  researchers  considered  three  different  types  of  anomaly  detection 
methodologies, namely naive point anomalies, contextual point anomalies, and level shifts. Machine 
learning methods were then employed on a real data set showing good precision rates. 

Taking everything into consideration, there have been several approaches to analyse temperature 
measurements and define abnormal behaviour of the respective environments. Recent studies have 
started  to  include  critical  infrastructure  in  their  analyses  as  well,  but  their  approaches  are  rather 
focused  on  optimal  system  management,  energy  efficiency,  and  reliability  of  services.  Given  the 
recent  increase  of  cyber-attacks  in  industrial  systems,  we  believe  that  real-time  temperature 
monitoring  in  data  centres  should  start  to  be  examined  by  the  security  community  as  an  attack 
mitigation measure. Moreover, temperature monitoring should not be analysed separately, but rather 
in conjunction with network and security monitoring measures.  

Additionally, there is a need for efficient time response of anomaly detection methods in operational 

   
 
 
processes applied  to  data  centres; this type of approach can be observed in the field of financial 
streaming  analytics,  such  as  in  the  study  of  [2],  where  having  the  lead  in  financial  transactions 
provides an advantage. Finally, we should note that the type and quality of data used in model testing 
is of paramount importance. In the next section, we address these issues by proposing a framework 
based on a combination of recent methods and tools published by [10, 29, 37, 38]. 

5  Multi-Variant Anomaly Detection & Fuzzy Logic 

In an attempt to address the specific technical problem, we propose a hybrid method that merges 
the strongest elements of the methodologies in [10, 29, 38]. A study by [10] highlighted the need for 
performing anomaly  detection  in  multi-variate time sensing environments  and proposed RADM, a 
real-time anomaly detection algorithm based on Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and Bayesian 
Network (BN). Their methodology outperformed anomaly detection in univariate sensing time-series, 
when tested on CPU, network, and memory sensors. Additionally, [10] introduced the health factor 
α, which measures the overall health of the system  by considering the individual anomaly scores 
calculated by HTM for each parameter (e.g., CPU). We should note that HTM is a far more accurate 
representation of the neural structures and mechanisms of the brain than the widely spread neural 
networks. 

In  their  study,  [29]  demonstrated  a  sophisticated  decentralised  scheme  for  fault  detection  and 
classification  where  wireless  sensor  networks  are  prevalent.  According  to  their  sensor  monitoring 
methodology, neighbour sensors can be grouped by conducting calculations among sensor readings. 
For  sensor  measurement,  their  choice  of  time-series  model  was  the  Auto-Regressive  Moving 
Average  model  (ARMA).  Fault  detection  is  performed  when  reading  is  com-  pared  to  a  certain 
threshold and then the fault classification algorithm is initiated to determine the fault type. The fault 
reading is checked for the frequency and continuity, as well as the presence of an observable pattern. 
According to these criteria it is then classified as a) random, if discontinuous and appearing randomly, 
b)  malfunction,  if  discontinuous  and  appearing  frequently,  c)  bias,  if  continuous  and  exhibiting  no 
pattern, d) drift, if continuous and following   a pattern. For their investigation, they used an outdoor 
temperature dataset, achieving accuracy rates between 85% and 95%. The ever-increasing need for 
intelligent  systems  in  the  security  domain,  also  led  to  non-traditional  approaches,  such  as  Fuzzy 
Logic  and  Fuzzy  Inference  Systems.  Researchers  in  [38]  proposed  a  fuzzy-based  approach  to 
overcome  complexities  in  Building  Energy  Management  Systems  (BEMS).  More  specifically,  they 
were able to use the nearest neighbour and fuzzy rules to extract normal building behaviour. Then, 
they used fuzzy linguistic descriptors for a variety of parameters, such as zone temperature, exhaust 
fan load, supply fan current etc. 

In this paper, our goal is to perform anomaly detection with the main focus on temperature while, 
considering  various  measured  phenomena  as  inputs.  The  proposed  methodology  combines 
elements  from  all  three  previous  works  and  split  them  into  four  main  steps.  First,  we  perform  a 
grouping of sensors as per the type of measured phenomenon or the spatial distribution of sensors 
measuring the same reading. Second, we perform fault detection on the grouped time series models 
individually. In the case where a faulty reading has been detected, we perform fault classification to 
define its type according to continuity, frequency, and pattern criteria. Third, the grouped time series 
are inserted into the RADM framework, where the global anomaly region is defined. If once again, 
the system detects an anomaly on the overall system, we perform fault detection to define the type. 
Finally, we perform a permutation of the health factor α based on Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy Rules. More 
details about each step are provided in the following sections. 

 
 
 
5.1  Step 1: Thermal Sensors Grouping 

In this step, we acknowledge that the ambient temperature of data centres is a product of more than 
one  factors.  For  instance,  new  or  advanced  cooling  systems,  such  as  rack  cooling,  have  been 
employed in recent years to aid in reserving the servers’ ideal state. Consequently, there is a clear 
need to consider more than one input when building time series models for anomaly detection. For 
this reason, we propose a sensor grouping technique which groups sensor readings that measure 
the same phenomenon, e.g., grouping of all ambient air temperature sensors in a room, fan motor 
speed, etc. Similarly, sensors can be also grouped spatially, for example aggregating high-mounted 
ambient temperature sensors of a specific aisle in a single group, low-mounted ambient temperature 
sensors in a different one, creating a group for high-mounted rack temperature sensors, and so on. 
For this method, we employ the Neighbourhood Voting scheme proposed by [29]. According to them, 
the  system  does  not  require  a  priori  knowledge  about  the  of  sensor  readings.  By  changing  the 
notation to keep the consistency of our framework, we present the Neighbourhood Voting algorithm 
as it appears in environment. Instead, it takes advantage of the redundancy in measurements their 
study: 

1)  Collect the set of readings 𝑅  =  𝑟 [1 . . . |𝑁𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 (𝑌𝑖)|] from all neighbours, excluding its 

own reading 𝑟𝑖. 

2)  Calculate the median of the group, µ  =   {𝑅}1
2

=   𝑟 . 

3)  Calculate the difference between 𝑟𝑖 and 𝑟, 𝐷𝑟,𝑟   =   |𝑟𝑖   −   𝑟| 

4)  Compare the difference   𝐷𝑟,𝑟  with a threshold 𝜏, that can be adjusted. 

– 

– 

If 𝐷𝑟,𝑟 <  𝜏  then 𝑟𝑖 is a good reading. 

If  𝐷𝑟,𝑟 ≥  𝜏  then  𝑟𝑖  is  a  faulty  reading.  We  define  faulty  readings  as 𝐷𝑟,𝑟 = 𝜀𝑖 

where Yi is a node measuring a specific phenomenon, 𝑟𝑖 is its reading. The set of its neighbours is 
denoted by 𝑁𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 (𝑌𝑖) and the number of neighbours by |𝑁𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑟 (𝑌𝑖)|. 

5.2  Step 2: Fault Detection 

In this step, we perform fault detection on the aforementioned grouped measurements. Because of 
the many advantages it exhibits for anomaly detection over traditional time-series, grouped readings 
are modelled with HTM time-series as suggested by [10], and not the ARMA model preferred in [29]. 
If  a  faulty  reading  is  detected,  the  Fault  Classification  Algorithm  proposed  in  [29]  is  initiated.  The 
algorithm  is  run  parallel  to  the  HMT  modelling  to  classify  the  faulty  measurement  as  either 
malfunction,  random,  bias,  or  drift,  according  to  the  Fault  Classification  Algorithm  (Algorithm  1), 
where T represents time intervals, 𝜀𝑖 the numbers of faulty occurrences, and θ the desired threshold.

5.3  Step 3: Anomaly Region Detection 

During the third step of the process, the HTM time-series of the grouped variables are combined with 
the Bayesian Network to detect the  anomaly region.  The time-series follow the  RADM framework 
proposed  by  [10].  As  previously  discussed,  we  define  the  temperature  T  of  the  data  centre  as  a 
product of factors X, Y, and Z, according to Equation 1: 

𝑇 (𝑡) =   (𝑋(𝑡), 𝑌 (𝑡), 𝑍(𝑡))          (1) 

Then, the overall process, including steps 1, 2, and 3, is described in Figure

proposed by [29], while boxes in blue comprise the RADM framework proposed by [10]. 

5.4  Step 4: Fuzzy sets 

In the fourth step of our methodology, we propose a permutation of the health factor α proposed by 
[29],  in  order  to  assess  the  overall  wellbeing  of  our  frame-  work.  Our  method  uses  linguistic 
descriptors to describe the concept of the system’s anomaly state in an aggregated and intelligent 
manner. The method uses fuzzy rules similar to the analysis by [38], except the input variables con- 
sist  of  the  anomaly  scores  Si  calculated  by  the  HTM  model  for  the  grouped  variables.  More 
specifically, the input variables are represented using five fuzzy sets, namely very low, low, medium, 
high, and very high. The output variable Health is represented again by five fuzzy sets, that describe 
the state of the system as: very bad, bad, average, good, and very good. Input and output linguistic 
descriptors are shown in Figure 3. Fuzzy rules are then constructed according to experience and 
describe the contribution of individual anomalies to the general state. The linguistic descriptors for 
the healthiest state with the three inputs used in our example would be: 

𝑰𝑭 𝑆𝑋(𝑡)𝑰𝑺 𝑉𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝐿𝑜𝑤 𝑨𝑵𝑫 𝑆𝑌(𝑡)𝑰𝑺 𝑉𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝐿𝑜𝑤 𝑨𝑵𝑫 𝑆𝑍(𝑡)𝑰𝑺 𝑉𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝐿𝑜𝑤 𝑻𝑯𝑬𝑵 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑡ℎ 𝑰𝑺 𝑉𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝐺𝑜𝑜𝑑 (2)  

Finally, to put this methodology into action, we propose the DAD data set published by [37]. The DAD 
data set is a labelled IoT data set, which contains real-world behaviours of a data centre as seen 
from the network. The network and environmental values were obtained from a physical data centre, 
combined with temperature measurements transmitted by NFC smart passive sensor technology.

6  Conclusions and Future Work 

Thermal attacks present a serious vulnerability in data centres today. By launch- ing a thermal attack, 
an adversary can cause a complete meltdown to the equipment stored inside a data centre. In this 
paper,  we  examined  how  easily  temperature  monitoring  systems  can  be  used  by  attackers  to 
manipulate heat distribution in such environments. We also presented and reviewed existing model-
based anomaly detection methods that have been focused on measuring temperature deviations in 
critical infrastructures. According to our findings, thermal attacks are fundamentally not addressed 
as  potential  cybersecurity  attacks  for  data  centres,  and  consequently,  there  is  a  serious  lack  of 
frameworks  proposed  to  eliminate  this  threat.  We  believe  that  future  studies  on  the  current  topic 
should be focused on constructing intelligent solutions. In our research, we found several approaches 
to  tackle  this  issue  and  addressed  the  most  important  aspects  for  a  thermal  attack  mitigation 
methodology. According to this, we suggested the use of a multi-variate anomaly detection method 
that could perform fault classification, and a fuzzy-based health factor to assess of the overall state 
of  the  system.  Finally,  we  propose  a  curated  data  set  that  could  assist  in  the  exploration  of  the 
aforementioned models.
