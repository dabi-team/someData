INTRODUCTION  

in 

Data  is  becoming  largely  existent  in  today's  world  than 
they were anticipated some three decades ago [1]. Individuals 
are keeping lot more amount of information than organizations 
the  yesteryears.  Significant  amounts  of  such 
kept 
information  are  valued  and  consequently  preferred  to  be 
known to  them  alone.  Such  valued information includes  their 
financial  details,  medical  records,  locations,  as  well  as 
professional  and  network 
information.  Businesses  and 
organizations  possess  larger  amounts  of  information  than 
individuals. A  good  amount  of  such  information  is  critical  to 
their  sustained  existence  and  growth.  Their 
intellectual 
properties  and  trade  secrets  are  kept  away  from  potential 
exploits,  thus,  considered  very  private.  Governments  and 
agencies  keep  sensitive  information  that  may  affect  the 
stability  of  their  jurisdictions,  politically  or  economically,  if 
divulged.  

   The  necessity  to  keep  such  information  within  the 
required  confines  describes  a  component  purpose  of

   Data  encryption  may  not  be  an  explicit  solution  to 
information  security  problems,  as  organizations  remain 
increasingly  vulnerable  to  data  breach  incidents,  but it  is  still 
the most efficient fix when deployed adequately [4]. This has 
led  to  the  growing  availability  of  full  disk  encryption  tools. 
Disk  manufacturers  are  embedding  full  encryption  tools  into 
their products, making encryption more available for use [5].  

   The  study  conducted  by  [4]  showed  the increased  usage 
of  full  disk,  virtual  volume,  native  disk,  and  flash  drive 
encryptions  over  two  years.  However,  for  reasons  other  than 
the  cost  of  deployment  and managing  an  encryption  solution, 
some  organizations  have  shunned  or  still  undecided  about 
adopting  encryption  solutions. They  insisted that  “availability 
is  more  important  than  confidentiality”  [6].  The  time  the 
encryption  and  decryption  processes  take  before  data  is made 
accessible to potential users may cause delay in organizations' 
operations,  depending  on how  complex  the  base  algorithm is. 
Such  delays  may  escalate  to  a  sort  of  denial-of-service 
situation,  which  may  be  adverse  to  organizations'  businesses. 
On  the  electronic  discovery  front,  unavailability  problem

II.  NECESSITY & SCOPE 
Surveys  revealed  the  continuously  increasing  adoption  of 
cryptographic  solutions  by  organizations  for  various  data 
security platforms within the last five  years  [6]. The report of 
the surveys infers the anticipation of non-users to adopt partial 
or  holistic  cryptographic  solutions  in  the  nearest  future.  This 
impending  domination  by  cryptographic 
suggests 
procedures,  to  protect  information  in  the  computer  world. 
There  are  ways  for  investigators  to  outmaneuver  the  use  of 
cryptography  as  a  provocation  to  digital  forensics  processes. 
These  methods  are  either  by  legally  obtaining  appropriate 
'search and seize' authorizations or tactically planning to catch 
the  offender  unawares  and  hence,  access  live  –  running  and 
unencrypted  –  systems  [5].  However,  only  a  handful  of 
encryption  incidents  encountered  by  investigators  have  been 
solved using those methods. The larger lot of about 60% often 
does  not  get  prosecuted,  not  because  they  were  missed,  but 
because nothing could be done to access the potential evidence 
[8][9].  An  instance  is  the  case  of  Brazilian  banker  Daniel 
Dantas,  whose  strong  truecrypt  passphrase  has  foiled  all 
attempts  by  Brazilian  police  and  FBI  to  access  his  encrypted 
potential evidential hard drives [10][11].  

The inconsistency of legal systems across boundaries does 
not  make  the  process  easier,  as  laws  may  or  may  not  enjoin 
perpetrators  to  help  the  investigators  access  the  encrypted 
medium  [12].  This  was  evident  in  the  Dantas'  suspected 
money  laundering  case,  where  Brazil  had  no  legislation  to 
make him reveal his passphrase or encryption type, unlike the 
United  Kingdom  [11].  Therefore,  researchers  and  developers 
need to be reminded of privacy-enforcement threats to forensic 
investigations, and pestered about the need for technologies to 
help deal with accessing encrypted storage devices.

   The  United  Kingdom's  Data  Protection  Act  1998  most 
suitably  describes  the  confidentiality  element  of  information 
security.  It  seeks  to  ensure  that  the  information  held  by 
organizations  of 
their  customers  and  employees  are 
safeguarded  from  other  uses  than  they  were  obtained  [15]. 
This  is  meant  to  avert  incidents  such  as  identity  crimes,  and

led to the increasing adoption of encryption solutions [6].

There is also a huge necessity to ensure the confidentiality 
of  data  items,  at  rest,  in  use,  or  in  motion  [17].  Financial 
organizations,  where  transactions  are  regularly  performed  on 

data,  have  to  ensure  that  such  data  are  not  subject  to 
unauthorized access or modifications. The combination of the 
encryption  and  hash  technologies  to  create  digital  signatures 
and  certificates,  which  are  used to  ensure data  confidentiality 
and integrity, is a laudable approach [18]. 

As  far  as 

information  security 

is  concerned,  data 
encryption  technology  has  been  of  invaluable  success  on  the 
confidentiality and integrity fronts. Whereas on the availability 
front,  it  is  known  for  delays  on  sparse  occasions.  Serious 
availability  issues  caused  by  the  deployment  of  encryption 
solutions  are  not  unheard  of,  although  they  are  usually 
addressable by providers [19]. In an overall sense, it is hence, 
agreeable  to  regard  data  encryption  as  a  massive  solution  for 
information security challenges. 

B.  Data Encryption for Digital Forensics 

During  their hard  disk  sanitization  study  at  Massachusetts 
Institute  of  Technology's  Laboratory,  [14]  found  out  the  ease 
with which data can be retrieved from disk drives. The ability 
to  recover  deleted  data  and  locate  hidden  data  was  not  a 
challenge,  because  there  were  forensic  tools  that require  little 
or  no  specialized  user  training  in  existence.  The  success  of 
those  tools  was  attributed  to  the  “widespread  failure  of  the 
market  to  adopt  encryption  technology”  [14].  Some  eight 
years after his  work  at  the  MIT laboratory,  [20]  admitted that 
the current forensic tools are struggling to be useful to digital 
forensics  investigators  when  certain  data  are  concerned.  He 
stressed  the  increasing  occurrence  of  such data  and identified 
format incompatibilities, encryption and lack of training as the 
reasons.  [21]  Highlighted  data  scalability  and  encryption  as 
some of the unaddressed issues too. 

Encryption of data on disk drives is implemented at the file 
system  encryption and  full  disk  encryption  (bitstream) levels. 
At  the  file  system  encryption  level,  individual  files  are 
encrypted  with  separate  keys.  Although  the  file  system 
encryption protects virtually all the files in a disk drive, other 
data  outside  the  file  system  are  omitted.  Full  disk  encryption 
secures  data  on  disk  drives  with  a  single  symmetric  key.  Full 
disk  encryption  protects  data  in  all  areas  of  the  disk  drive, 
including  areas  outside  the  file  system.  Such  data  are  the 
hidden  files,  swap  files,  file  metadata,  temporary  files  and 
caches, registry files, and boot sector data [22][23][24][25]. 

The preservation and acquisition of an encrypted disk drive 
can be tricky, depending on the power state, level, and type of 
encryption  used  –  hardware-based  or  software-based  [5].  It 
may be easier to preserve and acquire a file system-encrypted 
disk drive than a fully-encrypted disk drive in the powered off 
state. Likewise, the acquisition of a software-implemented and 
fully-encrypted  disk  drive  may  be  easier  than  a  hardware-
implemented and file system-encrypted disk drive. Acquisition 
may be totally impossible in cases where disk is not accessible 
[8].  

The  examination  and  analysis  phases  of  digital  forensics 
investigation  suffer  the  most  from  encryption  technology. 
Reference  [7]  explained  that  there  may  be  a  possibility  to 
recover an encrypted data, but it is often impossible to process 
the data. An examiner's tool needs access to read the contents 
of  the  encrypted  data  to  be  processed.  However,  they

downplayed the threat posed to digital forensics by stating the 
possibility  to  circumvent  encryption  technology,  even  though 
it may be time-consuming and luck-dependent.    

IV.  DATA ENCRYPTION TOOLS AND KNOWN FORENSICS 

MANOEUVRING METHODS 

and 

employ  different  key  management 

There  are  numerous  data  encryption  solutions  for  disk 
drives.  Each  solution  addresses  data  protection  and  privacy 
requirements  using  different  methods.  Some  encryption 
solutions  are  compatible  with  particular  operating  systems, 
unlike  others  who  are  portable. They  protect  data at different 
and 
levels 
authentication  methods.  Most  encryption  solutions  are 
implemented  as  software,  but  hardware-based  solutions  are 
preferred by some organizations [25]. Here is a list of popular 
disk  drive  encryption  solutions:  Microsoft's  BitLocker, 
Symantec's  PGP,  Apple's  FileVault,  WinMagic's  SecureDoc, 
IronKey's  D200,  RSA  Data  Security's  RSA  SecurPC,  and 
McAfee's  Endpoint  [25][26][27].  However,  the  TrueCrypt 
solution has been briefly examined in this paper because of its 
immensely  controversial  reputation  and  gross  utilization 
[8][9][22].  

Although  investigators  are  not  entirely  incapacitated  by 
data  encryption,  sometimes  it  is  down  to  the  legal  system  to 
help  get  access  to  evidential  data  [7].  They  stated  that 
perpetrators  used 
the  file-system  encryption 
because  they  are  concerned  only  about  the  data  that  are 
incriminating  in  their  own  opinions.  The  other  areas  left 
unencrypted  usually  contain  sufficient  evidence  to  prosecute 
them.  

to  employ 

However,  the  threat  posed  by  a  full  disk  encryption 
solution is more detrimental to digital forensics processes. But 
as the  saying  goes  that  “no machine  is  100%  efficient”, these 
encryption solutions have some exploitable vulnerabilities. 

The  encryption  status  seizes  to  hold  for  all  data  on  the 
entire  disk  from  the  point  the  symmetric  key  has  been 
accepted by the system until it is shut down. Deductively, data 
becomes  accessible  and  inaccessible  when  the  system  is 
powered  on  and  off  respectively  [7][25].  Digital  forensics 
investigators  need  to  execute  an  authorized  and  well-planned 
“search and seizure”, with the aim of catching the perpetrator 
unawares while his system is running. 

   Another  way  to  circumvent  the  threat  is  the  traditional 
search  for  the  encryption  key  [25].  There  is  a  possibility,  no 
matter  how  unlikely,  that  the  key  to  decrypt  the  disk  drive  is 
written on a notepad or stored in USB drive somewhere at the 
scene. 

Advanced  memory-based  procedures  are  also  used  to 
overcome  the  encryption  threat.  The  concept  of  the  full  disk 
encryption that decrypts and makes data available for use is a 
memory function. The encryption key is stored in the memory 
the first time it was supplied. It remains in the memory and is 
used to automatically decrypt required data until the system is 
powered  off.  Various  techniques  can  be  used  to  retrieve  the 
encryption  key  from  the  memory.  RAMs  hold  data  for  few 
seconds to minutes – extendable by keeping the RAM cooled 
– without power. They can then be accessed through dedicated 
tools,  such  as  MoonSol's  Windows  Memory,  GMG  Systems' 

KnTList,  Passware  or  F-Response.  However,  tools  such  as 
Wiebetech's  HotPlug  can  be  used  to  transfer  the  running 
system to a back-up power supply in case required expertise is 
not  available  and  seized  system  needs  to  be  moved  to  a 
laboratory [5]. 

A.  The TrueCrypt Scenario 

TrueCrypt  was  first  released  in  2004,  as  a  privacy-
enforcing  solution  by  the  TrueCrypt  Foundation.  It  is  a  very 
sturdy,  free  and  open-source  software  solution,  which  allows 
intentional or accidental (sudden power outage), partial or full 
encryption  and  decryption  processes,  without  compromising 
its data security ability. Several encryption algorithms used by 
TrueCrypt  to  encrypt  data  include  Advanced  Encryption 
Standard  (AES),  TwoFish,  Serpent,  AES-Twofish,  Serpent-
AES,  AES-Twofish-Serpent,  Twofish-Serpent,  and  Serpent-
Twofish-AES. The PIPEMD-160, SHA-512 or Whirlpool hash 
algorithms,  with  a  Random  Number  Generator,  are  used  to 
create  key-files  for  stronger  security. TrueCrypt  is  capable  of 
running  in  a  portable  mode,  without  being  installed  on  the 
target disk drive. It supports smart cards and tokens for added 
security  level  and  provides  hot-keys  to  perform  encryption 
tasks swiftly. It encrypts data in a partition/drive as a whole, or 
in a file-hosted container [5][9][22][24][27][28][29]. 

1)  Challenges Posed by TrueCrypt 
TrueCrypt  employs  both  the  file-system  and  full-disk 
encryption  methods.  This  ensures  that  all  data,  including 
registry entries, swap space, file metadata, temporary files, and 
hidden  data  are  protected  from  unauthorized  access.  This 
leaves  investigators  with  the  options  to  plan a  surprise access 
to  a  running  system,  search  for  possibly  exposed  encryption 
key, or use advanced memory-fetching techniques for keys  or 
data [9][24][29]. 

TrueCrypt 

(OTFE)-based 
is  an  on-the-fly-encryption 
software. This  concept  ensures  that  only  the  data required by 
the user is available for access. All data are encrypted from the 
onset.  The  required  data  is  copied  into  the  memory  and 
decrypted  for  use  there.  As  such,  the  data  on  the  disk  drive 
remain  encrypted.  Once  the  data  being  processed  by  the  user 
has changed and need to be saved to disk, TrueCrypt encrypts 
and  saves  it  to  the  disk.  Further,  restricting  investigators' 
access methods to those highlighted earlier [24]. 

Plausible  deniability  is  a  feature  confidently  boasted  by 
TrueCrypt.  The  encrypted  volume/drive  appears  as  a  drive 
with random data. A suspicious reaction to the randomness can 
be quashed with an explanation of a normal wipe process that 
fills  drive  with  random  data.  This  plausible  deniability  is 
possible  because  TrueCrypt  does  not  have  any  signature  that 
would  be  otherwise  found  in  the  drive's  partition  table 
[5][24][28][29].  

It also allows volumes and operating systems to be hidden 
inside  a  visible  TrueCrypt  volume.  The  hidden  volume  is 
encrypted  by  a  different  key  than  the  volume  which  contains 
it.  It  resides  within  the  illusional  random  data  created  by  the 
encryption of the visible volume. The user choses the volume 
to mount for use by the encryption key he supplies. If the legal 
system  forces  him  to  disclose  his  encryption  key,  he  can 
disclose  the  key  for  the  encrypted  volume  alone. The  hidden

volume,  which  will  usually  contain  evidential  information, 
remains oblivious to investigators [24][30].  

A  case  example  was  a  suspected  terrorist,  whose  laptop 
was  turned  on  and  had  the  TrueCrypt  mount  window 
displayed. After initial refusal to disclose the encryption key, a 
High  Court  order  requested  he  did.  The  case  was  dismissed 
the 
later  on,  as  no  evidence  could  be  gathered  by 
investigation/prosecution team against him (5). It is suffice  to 
say  that  the  suspected  terrorist  might  have  supplied  the  outer 
encrypted  volume's  key  rather  than  the  hidden  volume's  key. 
The  plausible  deniability  feature  of  TrueCrypt  proves  to  be  a 
higher defeat to the three get-around digital forensics methods 
currently being used. Since, the TrueCrypt encryption solution 
is  a  widely  available  free  software,  experienced  cyber-
criminals  will  continue  to  use  the  features  to  avoid  being 
prosecuted. 

The  following  section  looks  at  possible  counter-actions  to 

the robustness offered by encryption solutions for disk drives.  

V.  MUTED SOLUTIONS TO DATA ENCRYPTION THREATS 
Reference  [8]  highlighted  two  possible  solutions  to  the 
forensics threats posed by inaccessible information containers. 
The first was the collaboration of digital forensics experts and 
storage  device  manufacturers  to  develop  and  implement  a 
standard back-door across all storage devices. 

of 

evidence 

This would seem the perfect solution, but Forte thought it 
was  an  excessive  ask  and  “very  unlikely  to  succeed”.  Three 
years  on,  there  has  not  been  any  such  collaboration  or 
development.  Forte  pointed  that  the  other  solution  involves  a 
cooperation of the parties involved in an incident towards the 
adjustment 
analysis 
methodologies.  He  however  admitted  that  the  latter  is  only 
possible  in  e-discovery  processes  where  both  parties  may  be 
willing  to  cooperate  rather  than  cyber-crime  incidents  whose 
subjects  are  often  reluctant.  Undecided  about  what  solution 
was  more  feasible,  even  though  the  former  seemed  more 
effective, [8] believed there was enough time to find solutions 
before encrypted storage containers become pervasive, and as 
sort lightened the push for the former solution.  

preservation 

and 

Reference  [24]  itself,  highlighted  that  physical  or  remote 
(by  malware  or  rootkit)  access  to  such  truecrypt-protected 
computer can compromise the encryption. The access may  be 
used  to  install  keyloggers  and  memory  capturing  software  or 
hardware  devices.  These  devices  can  obtain  the  encryption 
keys  and  passwords,  as  well  as  the  unencrypted  data  which 
could  be  decrypted  using  acquired  keys.  Kleissner's  “stoned” 
bootkit  is  a  particular  example  of  rootkit  that  can  give  such 
access  to  a target  computer.  It  infects  and  controls  the  master 
boot record of the truecrypt program, and consequently allows 
the  user  to  bypass  the  full  volume  encryption  feature  of 
truecrypt  to  access  data  resident  on  the  computer  [31]. 
However,  the  law  enforcement  agencies  would  be  breaching 
the  privacy  rights  of  such  individuals  if  physical  or  remote 
access  to  their  computer  is  gained  without  their  consent.  A 
situation  where  law  enforcement  agencies  have  legal  right  to 
physically  and  remotely  access  a  target  computer  is  the  sex 
offender  monitoring  case,  in  which  the  offender  has  actually 
been  convicted  of  the  crime.  Unfortunately,  a  yet-to-be-

convicted  suspect  that  has  actually  committed  a  cybercrime 
will  ordinarily  not  give  such  approval.  He  may  also  protect 
himself  with  the  self-incrimination  legal  clause.  Yet  again, 
privacy  needs  have  rendered  another  potentially-viable 
solution illegal. 

VI.  CONCLUSION 
The  effectiveness  of  data  encryption  as  a  mechanism  for 
enforcing  information  privacy  is  massive.  This  is  evident  by 
the  reported  widespread  use  of  various  data  encryption 
solutions at the organizational and individual levels. However, 
its huge success for data access restriction has been a threat for 
digital  forensics  processes  over  the  years.  Cyber-criminals 
have been exploiting the information confidentiality ability  of 
data  encryption  solutions, 
forensics 
to 
investigators'  accesses  to  potential  evidence.  The  ubiquitous 
availability,  inexpensive  cost  and  easy  implementation  of 
encryption  solutions  enhance  the  threats  posed  to  digital 
forensics  processes.  Investigators  sometimes  get  around  the 
encryption  challenge  through  careful  and  thoughtful  planning 
of search and seizure, thorough search for exposed encryption 
keys,  and advanced  in-memory  data retrieval techniques. Yet, 
a  minimum  of  60%  of  computer  incidents  involving  data-
encryption end up unprosecutable.  

restrict  digital 

The  TrueCrypt  software  went  even  further  by  providing 
users  with  plausible  deniability  and  non-repudiation  abilities. 
This  makes  digital  forensics  investigations  of  encrypted  disk 
drives  harder  and  less  feasible.  Consequently,  this  undesired 
situation  constitutes  an  indirect  reason  for  the  rise  in 
occurrence of computer incidents. As much as data encryption 
helps offenders get away from being caught, the necessity  for 
data  privacy  and  security  cannot  be  sacrificed  for  digital 
forensics.  Unfortunately,  the  only  digital  forensics  solution to 
a  threatening  information  security  solution  will  have  to  be 
unanimously  considered  by  disk  drive  manufacturers.  There 
should be a technology that will provide a backdoor for digital 
forensics  investigators  to  gain  access  to  the  most  securely 
encrypted  disk  drives.  However,  there  will  have  to  be  a 
restriction  to  the  distribution  of  such  technology  when  it 
comes  to  existence.  This  is  to  avoid  its  abuse  by  non-law 
enforcement  practitioners  (and  potential  computer  criminals) 
to illegally access target data.
