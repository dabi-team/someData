In this paper, we propose the first analysis of
cybersecurity challenges raised by Hyperloop technology.
We base our analysis on the related works on Hyperloop,
distilling the common features which will be likely to be
present in the system. Furthermore, we provide an analysis
of possible directions on the Hyperloop infrastructure
management, together with their security concerns. Finally,
we discuss possible countermeasures and future directions

Introduction
Hyperloop is a radically new concept of transportation
system introduced by Elon Musk in 2013 [1], where he
described a preliminary version (Figure 1) of the Hyperloop
project connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco. The
vision of Musk is to provide fast transportation means by
mitigating air resistance and friction. Besides the speed
objective, Hyperloop also allows for reduced operating costs
and, hence,

organized by SpaceX and later with the foundation of two
startups: Virgin Hyperloop and Hyperloop Transportation
Technologies. Today, different companies are working on

Hyperloop is characterized by two main elements: a
tube with vacuum capabilities and a capsule that travels
along the tube with passengers or cargo, exploiting air
pressure and electromagnetic forces. Hyperloop promises a
set of advantages compared to available transportation
systems. First of all, as already mentioned,
it provides
high-speed transportation. Airlines generally fly at 980km/h,
and special trains reach the speed of 570km/h, expected for

This paper analyzes the different components of the

in Hyperloop technology and the
challenges they pose in the area of cybersecurity. Despite the
lack of official documentation, we collected information
from publicly available sources and identified common
elements with other transportation systems, such as aviation,
railways, and automobiles, to create a high-level description
of the Hyperloop system. Then, we focus on the different
components and their interconnection, identifying the key
security and privacy vulnerabilities they imply. Finally, we
propose different security practices to prevent possible
attacks. We analyze the overall system from both a network
and physical point of view. To the best of our knowledge,

Physical Infrastructure
We represent in Figure 2 the overall physical infrastructure
of Hyperloop. We divide the physical system into three
macro components: the tube, the station, and the capsule.

Tube. The tube is a pipe with a near-vacuum environment
inside, reaching an air pressure equivalent to 60,960m above
sea level, where the Hyperloop capsule transits [4, 8].
Thanks to this environment, the tube significantly reduces
the aerodynamic drag to guarantee high speeds while
keeping energy consumption at a minimum level. The tube
exploits a series of venting valves deployed along its length
to
internal
the
environment. The details are depicted in Figure 2a.

and

In case of emergencies,

the capsule will stop at a
predefined emergency station deployed along the route
length. The tube is equipped with emergency egresses every
75m to allow passengers to exit the vehicle in case of need
[8]. The tube implements valves specifically built to isolate
and re-pressurize part of the tube to ease the repairing
process.

The Hyperloop system aims at producing more energy
than it consumes thanks to solar panels placed over the tube
[1, 8]. The energy consumption of the Hyperloop mainly
depends on the journey's distance and the number of seats,
but it is generally lower than aircrafts [9].

Capsule. Hyperloop trains are called pods or capsules.
Figure 2b schematizes the podâ€™s structure and components.
According to [3, 10], the capsule has the size of a small
commercial aircraft with a capacity of 28-50 passengers
each, allowing for the transportation of more than 160,000
passengers daily from Los Angeles to San Francisco
(561km) [3]. The capsule's size depends on the purpose (i.e.,
passenger or cargo), and the tube to pod size ratio varies
from 1.4 to 4 [10]. Different
levitation mechanisms are
under investigation, ranging from air beaming employed in
the first concept [1], to more efficient electromagnetic or
electrodynamic suspension systems [11]. Four propulsion
engines flank pods to support any possible levitation
implementation high-speed movements. Thanks to the sound
bulkhead, the capsule can accelerate without impacting the
quality of experience of the passenger.

Capsules are designed for ultra-high-speed using various
technologies.
In particular, pods can be wrapped with
materials to monitor and transmit critical information such as
temperature, stability, and integrity [3]. Two or more
lithium-ion battery packs will power the capsule life support
system, making it unaffected by power outages. Battery
packs will be charged at the base station before the start of
the journey. Otherwise, Musk mentions the possibility of
storing compressed air to reverse as energy with fans in
second moments [1].

Station. According to [8], the Hyperloop portal will be a
central hub that integrates all nearby transportation systems
to enable a seamless end-to-end journey. The station will

station will
include portals from which passengers may
depart and arrive. To foster the availability of on-demand
transportation and remove the need for
the
Hyperloop system will allow multiple pods to convoy or to
autonomously break away from a convoy to reach their
destination. This will be possible thanks to the high-speed
switching technology, which combines the benefits of
on-demand transportation with higher efficiency and train
throughput [8]. Furthermore, this system will allow pods to
avoid stopping at every station. Figure 2c shows a simplified
representation of the station.

depicted in Figure 3, we divide the network infrastructure
into four layers.

layer
Hyperloop Network. This Hyperloop-specific
contains the first communication link with the field network.
This includes communications between capsules (originating
from the pod itself or from user services), between capsules
and the station, or between capsules and the Internet. To
support the fast communication between internal antennas,
Remote Access Units (RAUs), and stations, we can assume
the existence of a wired bus (e.g., optical fiber) inside the
tube which interconnects these entities. RAUs are placed
outside the tube to provide an Internet connection to the
communication inside the tube. The connection between the
Hyperloop Network and the Access Network can be wireless
(e.g., WiFi, 5G) or wired (e.g., optical fibers) to meet the
requirement of fast communication. The tube is internally
equipped with several antennas used to communicate with
the pods. More antennas are installed on capsules to alleviate
the
[12]. The
communications originated by the users inside the pods and
from the instrumentation on the capsule are captured by the
internal antennas and then forwarded to the station (via a
wired connection) or the Internet (via RAUs).

Access Network. Connects the Hyperloop Network and the
Aggregation Network. The Access Layer is also responsible
for gathering the information between the various RAUs
placed along the tube and connecting them with one or more
Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In fact, since the tube can
be hundreds of kilometers long through different countries,
the ISPs can differ based on the geographical area. An ISP is
an organization that provides the Internet connection to the
requestor by assigning it a public IP address.

Besides communication coming from the pods,
this
network allows the ground station of Hyperloop to connect
to the Internet, enabling services such as remote connection.

Aggregation Network. It connects the Access Network to
the Core Network by gathering and routing the information
between the different ISPs. ADSL, WiFi, Ethernet, and
optical fiber are among the technologies used in this layer.

employed for

In the following, we divide the network into the different
communication
systemâ€™s
operation. Figure 4 represents a schema of the various
communications in the Hyperloop network. We divide
communications into Pod-to-Pod (P2P), Pod-to-Tube (P2T),
User-to-Pod (U2P), Tube-to-Station (T2S), In-Pod (InP), and
User to all the devices available in the stations (U2S), e.g.,
ticketing service).

the

Pod-to-Pod Communication
P2P communication exchanges information in a model
to vehicle platooning. Pods are expected to
similar
automatically merge and detach based on their routes [3]. To
avoid collisions, a pod must detect the presence of another
pod and its relative location. To this aim, pods exchange
messages containing information on their location and speed
with other pods. Data transmission between high-speed pods
could be supported by ad-hoc protocols similar to Dedicated
Short Range Communications used for vehicle-to-vehicle
communication.

Pod-to-Tube Communication
The P2T link is used to control the pods. Thanks to this link,
the tube can control and manage the magnetic or air forces
needed to handle the pod's movements and maneuvers.
Viceversa, the pod can apply the magnetic or air forces for
the movement generated by the onboard engine. It demands
great attention to guarantee safety to infrastructure and
passengers. The P2T link can also be used to exchange
messages about the status of the capsule and its location.
This information will then be delivered via a T2S link to the
central station for managing purposes, such as pressure
regulation and motor management. Thanks
to RAUs
deployed along the tube, the pod can also use the P2T link to

the

an infotainment

User-To-Pod Communication
To provide
system to users during
transportation, the pod is equipped with an internal wireless
network. Hence, users can retrieve information regarding the
trip status, their current location, and expected arrival time.
Furthermore, users have access to entertainment material and
more generally to the Internet. This connection is guaranteed
by the P2T communication link that provides access to the
Internet thanks to the RAUs located along the tube. The
various access points are connected to the local ISP which
enables the connection to the core network providing
Internet access.

Tube-to-Station Communication
The operations that the tube needs to handle to guarantee
that pods can safely travel from one station to another need
to be managed by a central entity. These operations include,
for instance, operating valves that create the near-vacuum
environment and the opening of emergency exits in case of
need. Furthermore,
the tube needs to actuate the podsâ€™
motion according to the scheduling and report to the station
information about the pods status for managing purposes.
These connections can be either wired (e.g., optical fiber) or
wireless (e.g., LTE, 5G), depending on the requirements in
terms of latency and reliability. Furthermore, a dedicated
power line will deliver the energy collected via solar panels
to the accumulator deployed at the central station. A second
power line will provide energy for operations related to the
tube. These operations include the application of power for
maglev and pods directioning.

In-Pod Communication
Each pod is equipped with an internal network where
controllers and actuators regulate the basic pod functioning.
This concept is similar to that exploited in modern vehicles,
where a Controller Area Network bus connects many

that continuously monitors data to guarantee
controller
safety. This network is also used to deliver power to the
different components of
the pod. For instance, suitable
controllers handle the flank propulsors that allow for
high-speed movements.
In-vehicle networks are usually
implemented via cable, and different ECUs manage different
pod parts.

User-to-(Devices in the) Station Communications
For a complete analysis of the Hyperloop system we have to
consider the communications occurring inside the station
between the users and the infrastructure. Many smart devices
are available to the users. Tickets can be bought from ad-hoc
terminals, which have to verify the availability of the seats
on the pods in real-time. Turnstiles manage the user access
to the boat area and could use the user's biometrics
information to facilitate the access. Displays show delays
and departure times for pods and help users find the proper
gate. Furthermore, even if not physically located in the
stations, we can consider the smartphone apps and web
services that enable users to remotely buy tickets in advance
to avoid long queues.

Cybersecurity Analysis

For each communication category, we present an analysis of
the possible security and privacy issues. Table 1 reports the
different attacks affecting each communication link,
the
corresponding threats, and their effect on the system.

cyberattacks

Pod-to-Pod Security
Several
can affect P2P communication.
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks can modify or craft
packets to include false information about
the pod and
generate a wrong reaction in the neighboring pods. For
instance, one pod under attack can claim to be close to the
preceding pod and make it speed up. Alternatively, an
attacker may launch a sybil attack by sending data from an
inexistent capsule to create inconsistencies between different
sensors. Furthermore, an attacker might capture P2P
communication packets in a blackhole attack preventing
packet forwarding. These attacks, especially if coordinated
on a certain number of capsules, can potentially be very
destructive and create disorder in the network. MitM can
also be used to send malicious messages to disconnect a pod
from a convoy. Another way to force the disconnection of a
pod could be a flooding attack leading to a Denial of Service
(DoS). This could make a capsule unable to receive
messages from other pods, inhibiting early reaction to the

Supposing that pods periodically broadcast their position
to alert all nearby pods, spoofing a false location could make
all
the other pods take wrong actions such as break or
speed-up/down even if not needed, leading to inefficiency
(e.g., delays) or crashes.

Pod-to-Tube Security
P2T communication has several purposes ranging from
critical aims (e.g., managing the levitation of the pod) to
forwarding the traffic from the
secondary scopes (e.g.,
infotainment system of the pod). A MitM attack can tamper
with the levitation mechanism to increase or decrease its
power leading to the derailing of the pod (i.e., slamming to
the edges or the floor of the tube). Hijacking a pod may also
be possible. In fact, due to the high-speed switching, an
attacker may trigger a switch to detach a pod from a convoy
and redirect it in the wrong direction.

but also with the ground station, through the tube, for central

communication to send messages with false locations of the
pods to generate inconsistencies in the system. Furthermore,
hiding the presence of a pod near the station via spoofing
could make another capsule leave the station before the
hidden podâ€™s departure, causing sudden breaks or incidents.
Although the podâ€™s location might be helpful for scheduling
purposes and estimation of arrival
the real-time
sharing of the location might represent a privacy threat.
Indeed, a user may target a specific pod and hijack it to a
particular location. Although the pod travels at a very high
speed, an attacker may predict when a targeting pod will
reach a specific point
in the tube based on the shared
location information. Therefore, it is fundamental to protect
the privacy of the podâ€™s location. Furthermore, an attacker
might infer information on the users traveling in the pod due
to the exchange of data from U2P and P2T. Without traffic
encryption or aggregation, an attacker may track and profile
users.

times,

To reach the ground station and the ISP, the pod must
forward the data through the tube. An attacker could disable
or delay this exchange of messages by performing a flooding
attack from a pod. DoS could lead to the disruption of the
infotainment system, and the delay of safety-critical data
flows.

It is possible to imagine an exchange of energy between
the tube and the pod (via, e.g., wireless power transfer) to
charge the podâ€™s batteries. This kind of energy flow must be
managed by the tube following the requests coming from the
pod. An attacker could tamper with this communication to
stop the energy request and avoid charging the pod, or it may
require more power than needed to damage the batteries.
Furthermore, a DoS could prevent the packet exchange, lead
to an unpredictable energy transfer behavior, or limit the
number of pods to benefit from it.

User-to-Pod Security
A central purpose of the U2P network is the infotainment
system. A malicious user can generate a DoS attack to

prevent other users from using the system. Since the pod is
shielded inside the tube, the stop of this communication
channel may imply the stop of every communication outside
the tube. To access the infotainment system the user is
requested to authenticate using credentials linked to the
to assign bandwidth and keep track of users'
ticket
misconduct fairly. A malicious actor can hijack another user
to circumvent restrictions or can DoS the authentication
system to avoid other users connecting to the access point. It
is reasonable to think that users will purchase a ticket that
grants them access to the pod. The pod is in charge of
checking the ticket validity. A malicious user may use a
relay attack to steal another user's ticket or jam the pod
receiver to prevent all users from accessing the pod.

Given the number of users connected to the same access
point, a malicious entity could try to attack other users, for
instance,
to eavesdrop on the communications and steal
sensitive information. MitM could also be possible for
non-encrypted communications, while traffic analysis could
be applied to infer users' activities by monitoring encrypted
data. With a view in the future, a router can also cache
content
to serve popular user requests faster [15]. These
systems can be vulnerable to cache poisoning attacks,
leading to phishing attacks and credentials leakages. A
malicious user can also eavesdrop on U2P communication to
track and profile a specific user's pod access.

Tube-to-Station Security
T2S communication must be reliable since it has to manage
the high traffic of pods and possible issues regarding trips. A
DoS attack can mine the system's availability and prevent
the exchange of messages in the T2S communication.
Again, even a small delay in data communication can be
devastating in systems with hard-real time constraints if
proper mitigation techniques are not in place.

Similarly, manipulation of the data transmitted can damage
the system. Sending malicious messages can affect the tubeâ€™s
functioning, such as forcing the depressurization. An evil
entity who obtained control of the channel could also insert
false anomalies or spoof podsâ€™ information, for instance, to
make the system stop for useless maintenance. On the
contrary, if the system suffers in case of minor malfunctions,
an attacker may spoof sensor values to hide anomalies and to
prevent
the proper monitoring of the Hyperloop system.
Another possible effect of an injection attack could be the
complete shutdown of tube partsâ€™ by, e.g., opening a closing
depressurization valve, creating an interruption of the service
and potential accidents.

the wired

Since the tube covers long distances, possibly in different
states, it is also important to consider physical attacks which
can damage the communications. A malicious actor can
tamper with
the
communication if cables are exposed to external entities. All
the devices such as RAUs, which are placed along the tube,
need constant monitoring because the manumission of the
T2S communication could potentially have catastrophic
consequences.

In-Pod Security
Even if most of the management and computations occur
outside the pod,

the capsule has
measurements and manage the actuators to execute the
station's orders. A DoS in the in-pod network could lead to a
consumption of resources and prevent or delay the reception
of critical messages. These urgent messages control critical
systems such as emergency stops or fire detectors. Hence
even a small delay in the packets could lead to accidents.
The capsule also controls many non-critical devices such as
ventilation and infotainment systems. Tampering with these
technologies can create discomfort to the users (e.g., losses
of connection, too high/low air temperature, turn off lights)
eavesdropping the
privacy
or
communication between the users and the access point. An
attacker gaining MitM capability in the in-pod network
could propagate false messages, creating inconsistencies in
the podâ€™s
alarm messages.
Alternatively, the malicious user could lead to dangerous
behaviors of the podâ€™s components (e.g., opening the door
while the pod is in movement), or tampering with the battery
management system to remove the power source.

User-to-(Devices in the) Station Security
A malicious user can exploit different attacks to impact U2S
security and privacy. Thanks to MitM and eavesdropping, an
evil user can steal sensitive data. Information on a specific
tracking,
user's habits may lead to profiling or user
representing a privacy violation. An attacker may also spoof
the U2S communication to create false messages. For
instance, an attacker may be able to bill another user for a
ticket or modify the information shared with a user on the
availability of free seats in a pod, thus preventing purchases.
Furthermore, the attacker may modify the information on the
pod for the purchased ticket, causing passengers to miss their
pods. Also, an attacker may modify the information that the
station shares with the user on scheduling and pod tracking,
thus causing traveling issues.

Attacks Countermeasures

The first line of protection of the system should follow the
best security practice and the security standards from the
system's design phase. These standards are applied by
industries but also by governments and researchers. Since
there are no security
technology,
Hyperloop is a novel
standards to support its design phase. However, Hyperloop
inherits different properties from other sectors, such as
automotive,
therefore the
railway systems, and aviation,
designer can rely on the existing standards. For instance,
automotive security policies are collected in different
standards such as AUTOSAR and ISO/SAE 21434. Instead,
industrial security standards are defined, for instance, in IEC
62443 and NCSC secure design principles.

Besides security standards, security mechanisms can be
applied to increase the overall security level of the system
and prevent attacks. Table 1 shows the list of the possible
countermeasures related to each attack previously described.

It

An important factor for preserving the system's function is
to ensure the correct localization of every pod. For this
reason, an attacker may try to spoof the pod's location to
alternate and compromise Hyperloop. Other
than the
previous measures to avoid spoofing, like encryption and
authentication, a common solution to prevent spoofing of
communication is the introduction of a distance bounding
protocol. This protocol measures the physical distance of an
entity by analyzing the expected response time. In this way,
the delay added by manipulating data or by a spoofed
position will be detected by the receiver. This protocol has
been widely used to prevent relay attacks and GPS spoofing.

technology that is still under development. Indeed, currently,
there are no official documents related to the system's
technical
implementation, which does not allow precise
analysis of the infrastructure. However, cybersecurity is a
continuous analysis process, which must be seriously
considered from the design phase. This requirement

emphasized since Hyperloop exhibits a large attack surface

and

This document represents the first work in the direction of
the analysis of the cybersecurity of the Hyperloop system. In
particular, we identified the main type of communication
characterizing the Hyperloop system and investigated
possible attacks and threats on the different parts of the
infrastructure. Then we discussed the best practices,
countermeasures,
to prevent potential
standards
catastrophic attacks. We reported how traditional attacks
could compromise the system's safety. Furthermore, we
discussed the privacy issues related to both users and the
infrastructure. For each of the identified vulnerabilities, we
also proposed possible countermeasures.

and

This analysis should be deepened in future works using
more precise technical details of Hyperloop. In addition, we
expect
that academia and industries will develop more
reliable communication and efficient protocols to support the
shortly. Future
Hyperloop
security researchers must also consider and include such
novel technologies.
