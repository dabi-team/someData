Abstract

With the advent of e-commerce and online banking it has become extremely important that the websites of
the ﬁnancial institutes (especially, banks) implement up-to-date measures of cyber security (in accordance with
the recommendations of the regulatory authority) and thus circumvent the possibilities of ﬁnancial frauds that
may occur due to vulnerabilities of the website. Here, we systematically investigate whether Indian banks are
following the above requirement. To perform the investigation, recommendations of Reserve Bank of India (RBI),
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), European Union Agency for Network and Information
Security (ENISA) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are considered as the benchmarks. Further, the
validity and quality of the security certiﬁcates of various Indian banks have been tested with the help of a set
of tools (e.g., SSL Certiﬁcate Checker provided by Digicert and SSL server test provided by SSL Labs). The
analysis performed by using these tools and a comparison with the benchmarks, have revealed that the security
measures taken by a set of Indian banks are not up-to-date and are vulnerable under some known attacks.

Introduction

Indian economy is one of the largest and fastest growing economy of the world, and with the recent initiatives of the
government, it is moving towards complete digitization. In a digital economy, secrecy of the exchanged information
would play a crucial role. In India, several steps have been taken by the banks and government agencies for the
orientation of the end users and thus to reduce the risk of simple frauds that originate due to the mistakes of
the users. However, there is another facet of the security of e-commerce, which involves the service providers and
requires that the banks provide highest possible security without becoming slow. To ensure that the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI), which regulates Indian banks have issued several circulars [1, 2], and have advised Indian banks
to use up-to-date encryption techniques [1–3]. Here, we aim to check, to what extend the Indian banks follow
the advices issued by the RBI and in what cases the security measures taken by the banks are vulnerable. We
would also suggest some solutions for the safe operations of the e-banking portals in the present and future. This
investigation would remain focused on the Indian banks, and would aim to reveal such cases where the security
measures taken by the Indian banks are not up-to-date and are vulnerable under some known attacks. To reveal
these vulnerabilities, we will adopt a more technical approach compared to the earlier studies on the security of
Indian banks and customer perspectives about that [4–6]. Speciﬁcally, the validity and quality of the security
certiﬁcates of various Indian banks will be tested here with the help of a set of tools (e.g., SSL Certiﬁcate Checker
provided by Digicert and SSL server test provided by SSL Labs). The analysis performed by using these tools and
a comparison with the benchmarks, have revealed that the encryption techniques used by many Indian banks are
vulnerable. The uniqueness of the present study is that to the best of our knowledge, no such technical analysis of
the encryption mechanism adopted by the Indian banks has been done until now.

We have already mentioned that the security and privacy issues of Indian banks have been studied earlier [4–6],
but a less technical view was adopted. Speciﬁcally, in Ref [4], possible attacks on customers’ information like
phishing, spooﬁng, vishing had been mentioned. Some eﬀorts had also been made to discuss card-related frauds,
merchant-related frauds, but no eﬀorts had been made to investigate the vulnerability of the banks. In another

study in the similar line (but not restricted to Indian banks) [7], various dimensions of e-service security had been
listed and utilized to obtain a hierarchical structure of them to compute the weights of security dimensions. Once
again, the analysis was more focused on the perspectives of the end users and led a trivial conclusion that “users will
intend to use e-service if they feel that the quality of e-service is high”. The same conclusion regarding the behavior
of end users has recently been reported again by Taherdoost in [8] through E-Service Technology Acceptance Model
(ETAM) which can evaluate the user acceptance of e-service technology even before the introduction of the service.
Such studies on the acceptability of an e-service by the end users is not new. In a set of earlier studies [9–19], similar
investigations have been made. However, the important question: Which technical (cryptographic) measures taken
by the bank can improve the security of e-service and thus lead to enhanced conﬁdence among the end users had
not been discussed in the earlier works. The present work aims to go beyond technology acceptance model and to
address this issue by highlighting the limitations of the security measures taken by diﬀerent banks.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2, we perform the vulnerability analysis of Indian
banks and establish that the encryption used by Indian banks are often vulnerable. In Section 3, we compare the
encryption techniques adopted by the Indian banks with the international standards and analyze them in view of the
recommendations of RBI. The comparison, has revealed that many banks are not strictly following RBI guidelines
and thus prone to cyber attacks. Subsequently, in Section 4, we suggest a set of measures that can be adopted
by Indian banks to avoid the use of vulnerable encryption techniques in future. Finally, the paper is concluded in
Section 5.

2 Vulnerability analysis

The SSL client certiﬁcates are obtained by the banks from diﬀerent certifying agencies (CA) like, Symantec Cor-
poration, DigiCert Inc., and Corporation Service Company. These organizations are allowed to issue SSL client
certiﬁcate. The online banking websites contain details of the certiﬁcates obtained by the banks and the validity of
the certiﬁcate. It also provides certiﬁed information about the encryption and authentication method used by the
bank to encrypt information before being transmitted over the internet. The quality of these encryption methods can
be analyzed to some extent by looking at the string like, “TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
256 bit keys, TLS 1.2”, which are obtained directly from the security certiﬁcate information of the banking website.
A full list of strings describing the encryption and the authentication methods adopted by diﬀerent banks are pro-
vided in Table A.I of Appendix A. Further, information about the quality of the encryption technique adopted and
their potential vulnerability can be obtained by performing various tests on SSL servers and/or SSL certiﬁcates.
Some of the online SSL certiﬁcate checking tools that may be used to reveal the potential vulnerability of the
adopted encryption technique are available at [20–23]. In what follows, we report and analyze the results of SSL
server tests performed by SSL Labs [20]. These tests not only reveal the potential vulnerability it also grades the
servers according to their strength. A server graded as A+ seems to be most strong, whereas a server graded as F is
considered to be the weakest or most vulnerable. We have analyzed the security of 38 banks using [20]. The result
is summarized in Fig. 1 (a)-(b), where 1 (a) provides the number distribution of grades obtained by diﬀerent Public
(Government controlled) banks and 1 (b) provides the same information for the private banks. Fig. 1 (a)-(b),
shows that 13 of the 38 banks obtained A, A+, and A- grades, and they may be viewed to provide relatively higher
security. Similarly, the analysis has shown that B and C grades have been obtained by 8 and 9 banks respectively.
Thus, we may conclude that these banks provide moderate security. Finally, remaining 8 banks are found to obtain
F grade, and they are highly vulnerable, implying the fact that the security measure taken by them is very weak.
There are many reasons that lead to the security weaknesses of this banks. Such weaknesses are characterized by
performing various vulnerability tests and summarized in Tables 1-3. Details of the insecure SSL ciphers supported
by the server of the banks and other drawbacks of these banks are summarized in these tables. Speciﬁcally, Table
1 is focused on the analysis of security of those banks that are reasonably secure (obtains A,A+ or, A− grades).
Table 2 and Table 3 summarizes the security analysis performed for the banks with moderate security (Grades B
and C) and those with weak security measures (Grade F), respectively. In a similar line, security analysis performed
for popular wallets provided by non-Banking organizations are reported in Table 4. While analyzing the limitations
of the security measures taken by a bank, in addition to the results of analysis performed by [20], we have also
used the outcome of analysis performed by [21], which essentially tests “Heartbleed vulnerability”, checks whether
the server supports backdated protocols like TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, SSL 3.0, etc., looks for known vulnerable Debian
keys and lists all the SSL ciphers supported by the server. This list is subsequently used to detect whether the
server supports insecure ciphers. The outputs of analysis performed using [20, 21] are combined in Tables 1-4. Here
it may be noted that in Table 4, we review the security provided by the most popular non-bank wallets used for
e-commerce by Indians. The analysis performed through [20, 21] has revealed that various banks use vulnerable

ciphers, specially some of them are found to use keys of inadequate length, support RC4 cipher with older pro-
tocols, support TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, SSL 3.0, etc., and to be vulnerable to Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy
Encryption (POODLE) attack (Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Indusind Bank and Punjab National Bank) and to
man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) (Bank of Baroda, Syndicate Bank, Indusind Bank). Here, it may be apt to note
that POODLE is a particular type of MITM attack that exploits internet and security software clients’ fallback to
SSL 3.0. These observations are illustrated through Fig. 1 (c), and summarized in Table A.II of Appendix A.

3 Comparison of the encryption techniques used with the benchmark
adopted internationally and advised by the regulatory authority

In Point 6 of RBI circular [1], it is categorically mentioned in the context of arrangement for continuous surveillance,
that “Testing for vulnerabilities at reasonable intervals of time is very important. The nature of cyber-attacks are
such that they can occur at any time and in a manner that may not have been anticipated. Hence, it is mandated
that a SOC (Security Operations Centre) be set up at the earliest, if not yet been done. It is also essential that
this Centre ensures continuous surveillance and keeps itself regularly updated on the latest nature of emerging
cyber threats”. The analysis performed above clearly indicates that most of the Indian banks are not following
this recommendation of RBI as they are still using vulnerable and backdated ciphers. Further, in the same context
(i.e., in the context of vulnerability), in Ref. [2] Page 31, Section 16, RBI has clearly emphasized on the necessity
of regular vulnerability tests by stating the following, “... Banks that do not scan for vulnerabilities and address
ii. The
discovered ﬂaws proactively face a signiﬁcant likelihood of having their computer systems compromised.
following are some of the measures suggested:

“a. Automated vulnerability scanning tools need to be used against all systems on their networks on a periodic

basis, say monthly or weekly or more frequently.

“b. Banks should ensure that vulnerability scanning is performed in an authenticated mode (i.e., conﬁguring

the scanner with administrator credentials) at least quarterly, ...”.

It’s clear that many banks are not strictly following this advise of RBI. In Ref. [2] Page 29, Section 14, point (v),
in the context of encryption, RBI has advised banks as follows, “Normally, a minimum of 128-bit SSL encryption
is expected. Constant advances in computer hardware, cryptanalysis and distributed brute force techniques may
induce use of larger key lengths periodically. It is expected that banks will properly evaluate security requirements
associated with their internet banking systems and other relevant systems and adopt an encryption solution that
is commensurate with the degree of conﬁdentiality and integrity required. Banks should only select encryption
algorithms which are well established international standards and which have been subjected to rigorous scrutiny
by an international cryptographer community....”. Now although RBI is recommending a minimum of 128-bit
SSL encryption, it is found that Kayur Vashiya Bank, Dena Bank4, Kotak Mahinrda, The South Indian Bank,
Punjab and Sind bank, etc., are still providing 112 bit encryption which is bellow the recommended norm. If we
further concentrate on the last part of the RBI advise that recommends the use of “encryption algorithms which
are well established international standards and which have been subjected to rigorous scrutiny by an international
cryptographer community”, we would easily realize that Bank should now follow at least 256-bit encryption to be
consistent with the international standards (i.e., recommendations of NIST, ENISA and IETF5 [24–26]) and stop
supporting SHA, SHA-1, SHA-224, TLS 1.0. TLS 1.1 and other vulnerable ciphers mentioned above. In fact banks
should now start using TLS 1.3 as it is faster than TLS 1.2 and it has many advantages over TLS 1.2. Further,
recently IETF has approved TLS 1.3 as the next version of TLS protocols [27].

4 Measures suggested to circumvent the vulnerability of encryption

techniques in future

Banks should immediately stop supporting vulnerable ciphers. In the next phase, they should implement post-
quantum crytographic protocols [28] like, lattice-based, multivariate, code-based, hash-based cryptography, and

4Recently stopped using 112 bit encryption
5IETF is the body that is authorized to approve internet standards and protocols. The recommendation of IETF for the algorithms
to be used for practical application are valid only for a period of six months, and consequently, it’s important to update the security
measures taken by a bank at least once in every six months.

replace the random number generators by quantum random number generators [29] and thus go for a hybrid
(classical-quantum) technology. Subsequently, they should look at the possibilities of implementing semi-quantum
[30, 31] protocols which would require end users (customers) to have quantum resources which are costly. A ﬁnal
goal should be to implement unconditionally secure and device independent quantum schemes [32, 33].

5 Conclusions

Most of the Indian banks are found to support insecure SSL ciphers. Some of the previous studies were restricted
to the banks of speciﬁc region or country (e.g., investigations performed in Refs [4, 10, 11, 15–17, 19] were restricted
to the banks of India, Hongkong and Malyasia, respectively), whereas others were not restricted. Present study is
also focused on Indian banks, but the methodology adopted and the conclusions obtained are valid in general. To
emphasis on this point we analyze the security of 11 non-Indian banks, which are selected from diﬀerent continents.
In what follows, we brieﬂy note the outcome of such an investigation in Table 5.

Table 5: Security analysis of some non-Indian banks.

This study is unique, as it’s the ﬁrst one of its kind in the context of Indian banks. However, the analysis
performed is not deep enough. Consequently, it opens up the possibility of a deeper analysis in future (which will
be reported elsewhere). As the adopted method is valid in general, it’s possible to use this simple approach to
analyze the security of banks and other e-commerce sites of other countries, too. Finally, we conclude the article
with an optimistic view and a hope that this article will be able to draw the attention of the concerned authorities,
and necessary steps will be taken by them to perform regular checking of vulnerability of the encryption techniques
adopted by then (as recommended by RBI) and to take corrective measures wherever required. This would help
banks to provide higher security and thus to improve the conﬁdence level of the end-users (acceptability of the
end-users), which the banks desire to improve. Further, we hope that the suggestions made from the perspectives
of a cryptographer will be used by the banks in near future and that would help them to circumvent many attacks
in the future.
