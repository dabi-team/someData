Abstract—COVID-19 (Coronavirus) hit the global society and
economy with a big surprise. In particular, work-from-home has
become a new norm for employees. Despite the fact that COVID-
19 can equally attack innocent people and cyber criminals, it
is ironic to see surges in cyberattacks leveraging COVID-19 as
a theme, dubbed COVID-19 themed cyberattacks or COVID-19
attacks for short, which represent a new phenomenon that has
yet to be systematically understood. In this paper, we make a ﬁrst
step towards fully characterizing the landscape of these attacks,
including their sophistication via the Cyber Kill Chain model. We
also explore the solution space of defenses against these attacks.

I. INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 (Cronavirus) pandemic has had a huge
impact on the global society and economy. It attacks everyone,
including both the innocent people and the cyber criminals.
Ironically, we have witnessed surges in cyberattacks leveraging
COVID-19 as a theme, dubbed COVID-19 themed cyberat-
tacks or COVID-19 attacks for short. For example, there is a
32X increase in the malware and phishing sites from February
25, 2020 to March 25, 2020 [1]; Google has been blocking 240
million COVID-19 related spam emails and 18 million phish-
ing and malware emails daily [2]; there is a 148% increase in
ransomware attacks in March 2020 over February 2020 [3].
The situation is further exacerbated by the new norm of work-
from-home because employees’ home computers or devices
are often less protected than their enterprise counterparts.
Indeed, a CheckPoint survey [4] shows that 55% of security
professionals are concerned with remote access and 47% are
concerned with their employees using shadow IT systems from
their home. Until now, COVID-19 attacks have mainly targeted
the ﬁnance, healthcare, government, media streaming, retail
business, and COVID-19 research sectors. In response, experts
have recommended using multi-factor authentication for crit-
ical transactions, virtual private networks for remote access,
and regularly patching and updating software as immediate
solutions [5]. However, given that COVID-19 attacks are a new
phenomenon that is here to stay, it is important to understand
them thoroughly to pave a way for effective defense.
Our contributions. In this paper, we make a ﬁrst step towards
understanding COVID-19 themed cyberattacks. Speciﬁcally,
we explore ﬁve classes of them, namely malicious websites,

malicious emails, malicious mobile apps, malicious messag-
ing, and misinformation. In order to characterize these attacks,
we map them to the Cyber Kill Chain model [6]. We show that
they can use multiple attack techniques to achieve multiple
attack goals. We ﬁnd that COVID-19 attackers have been
professional rather than opportunistic and have been heavily
employing social-engineering cyberattacks. We further explore
the solution space of defenses against COVID-19 attacks.
Since COVID-19 attacks do have their counterparts that are
not speciﬁc to the COVID-19 incidents, our focus is on
exploring the COVID-19 speciﬁc aspects. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic characterization of
COVID-19 attacks and defenses, which can be adapted to cope
with any “X-themed cyberattacks” that may emerge in the
future, where X can be any kind of social incidents (e.g.,
election, natural or man-made disaster).

Related work. The problem of COVID-19 attacks has started
to receive attention from the research community. There are
studies on the types of cyberattacks and their trends amid
the COVID-19 pandemic [7]–[9], studies on speciﬁc cyber-
attacks related to COVID-19 (e.g., mobile malware ecosystem
[10], [11], cybercrimes [12], fake news related to COVID-
19 [13], and COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams [14]).
When compared with these studies, we aim at systematically
characterizing the landscape of the COVID-19 attacks, includ-
ing their sophistication through the the Kill Chain [6] and
exploring the space of defenses against these attacks.

Paper outline. Section II characterizes COVID-19 attacks.
Section III explores the defense solution space. Section IV
concludes the paper.

II. CHARACTERIZING COVID-19 ATTACKS

We characterize 5 classes of COVID-19 attacks: malicious
websites, malicious emails, malicious mobile apps, malicious
messaging, and misinformation. For this purpose, we collect
existing news reports and blogs on relevant cyberattacks, man-
ually verify them, and propose mapping them to the Lockheed
Martin’s Cyber Kill Chain [6], which is a model consisting of
the following 7 stages. (i) Reconnaissance, which corresponds
to pre-attack plannings, ﬁnding vulnerabilities, collecting pos-
sible victims, and setting attack goals. (ii) Weaponization,
which corresponds to setting up attack propagation mediums,
injecting malicious contents into the mediums, and setting

 
 
 
 
 
 
up traps to fool the identiﬁed victims. (iii) Delivery, which
corresponds to the attacker’s penetration into a victim’s system
through some entry point. (iv) Exploitation, which corresponds
to the wage of actual attacks against a victim’s system. (v)
Installation, which corresponds to the installation of malicious
payloads on a victim’s system. (vi) Command-and-Control
(C2), which corresponds to the attacker’s use of remote access
to the victims’ systems. (vii) Objectives, which corresponds to
the accomplishment of the attacker’s pre-determined goal.

A. COVID-19 Themed Malicious Websites

Attackers have abused websites to wage COVID-19 attacks
to steal
login credentials, sell fake medications related to
COVID-19, and inject malicious payloads into these themed
websites to distribute malware [7], [8], [15]. We map these
attacks to the Cyber Kill Chain model as follows.

(i) Reconnaissance: An attacker selects target audience,
chooses a COVID-19 related target theme, searches for cheap
and unregulated domain registration and web hosting services,
and sets attack goals. (ii) Weaponization: An attacker registers
new websites with COVID-19 related names. For example,
an attacker may register websites with typo-squatting names
to mimic legitimate websites related to COVID-19 (e.g.,
CDC, WHO, FDA) [16]; an attacker may register websites to
imitate legit Virtual Private Network (VPN) software or remote
communication software; an attacker may register domains to
offer fake legal services related to COVID-19; an attacker may
change an existing phishing website to accommodate COVID-
19 themes; an attacker may register fake media streaming
domains; and an attacker may register fake donation websites.
(iii) Delivery: An attacker hosts COVID-19 themed mali-
cious websites mentioned above. (iv) Exploitation: Victims
visit malicious websites, and then trust the fake forms or
download malicious payloads to their devices. (v) Installation:
A victim may provide sensitive information to a malicious
website or intentionally/unintentionally install malware. (vi)
C2: An attacker remotely controls victims’ infected computers,
for example instructing its agents (e.g., malicious websites,
downloaded malware) to send the stolen data/credentials to
the attacker. (vii) Objectives: An attacker gets sensitive creden-
tials, encrypts a victim’s computer, or gets ransom payment.

B. COVID-19 Themed Malicious Emails

Attackers have abused emails to wage COVID-19 attacks to
send phishing, spamming, scamming, malicious attachments,
and malicious websites [17]. We map these attacks to the
Cyber Kill Chain model as follows.

lists, selects a target

(i) Reconnaissance: An attacker selects target audience,
topic
generates and proﬁles email
for COVID-19 themed lures, and sets an attack goal. (ii)
Weaponization: An attacker creates fake typo-squatting email
addresses imitating legitimate entities (e.g., CEO, Netﬂix
support team, medical doctors), writes malicious emails with
legitimate logo (e.g., WHO, hospital
logo) and authority
names, writes emails with COVID-19 related information and
offers, writes emails with malicious attachments [18], [19],

writes fake COVID-19 donation scam emails [20], writes
emails with fake ﬁnancial relief payments [15], writes emails
with blackmailing schemes (e.g., threatening languages) [21],
writes emails to lure victims to provide personal information or
pay fees for false unemployment training and certiﬁcation [22].
(iii) Delivery: An attacker sends the aforementioned emails
to the target audience. (iv) Exploitation: A victim trusts an
email received from an attacker, clicks its malicious links,
opens its attachments, or downloads its malicious contents.
(v) Installation: A victim replies to the attacker with sensi-
tive personal information or installs malicious content on its
computer either intentionally or unintentionally. (vi) C2: An
attacker establishes connections with victim’s devices through
C2 channels, for example, to instruct the compromised com-
puters to send back sensitive data. (vii) Objectives: An attacker
encrypts a victim’s computer, receives ransom payment, or
receives sensitive information.

C. COVID-19 Themed Malicious Mobile Apps

Attackers have abused mobile apps to wage COVID-19
attacks to distribute malware and steal information from the
victims [10]. Google and Apple have taken steps during this
pandemic to reject publishing of COVID-19 related mobile
apps from unauthorized entities [23]. Despite these efforts to
secure reputed app stores, malicious apps could still get pub-
lished and remain undetected as many third party app stores
do not have proper reviewing and regulation for publishing
apps. Reports showing third-party app stores are eight times
more likely to contain malicious apps than than Google Play
store [24]. We map the attack of COVID-19 themed malicious
mobile apps to the Cyber Kill Chain model as follows.

(i) Reconnaissance: An attacker selects target audience
(e.g., based on geographical region), selects a COVID-19
themed topic/service (e.g., tracing, tracking, maps, VPN, re-
mote meeting, COVID-19 guidelines, COVID-19 test infor-
mation), ﬁnds and selects proﬁtable unregulated app stores,
and sets attack goals. (ii) Weaponization: An attacker creates
fake mobile apps with typo-squatted app names and legitimate
logos to imitate authentic apps, repackages existing COVID-
19 themed legitimate apps with malware or ransomware (e.g.,
banking Trojan, spyware) to trick users [10]. (iii) Delivery:
An attacker uploads malicious apps into the unregulated app
stores or code repositories, and advertises these mobile apps
through websites pop-ups. (iv) Exploitation: A victim trusts
an malicious app and downloads the app. (v) Installation: A
victim installs the downloaded malicious app on an mobile
device. (vi) C2: An attacker remotely controls victims’ com-
promised mobile devices to send sensitive user data to the C2
server. (vii) Objectives: An attacker encrypts a victim’s mobile
device, gets a ransom payment, or steals a victim’s private
information (e.g., login credentials, crypto wallet passwords),
breaches user privacy (e.g., location).

D. COVID-19 Themed Malicious Messaging

Attackers have abused messaging services to wage COVID-
19 attacks (e.g., phishing, malware, spamming, and scamming)

2

[9]. COVID-19 has increased the usage of mobile devices
which create more incentives for attackers. These attacks are
similar to malicious email attacks, but are unique in that
messaging can offer more emotional and persuasive live chats.
We map them to the Cyber Kill Chain model as follows.

(i) Reconnaissance: An attacker selects target audience
(e.g., based on demography, geography, severity of COVID-19
infections), collects phone and social media contacts, selects
target platform (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter), chooses a
COVID-19 themed topic (e.g., fake cures, products, services),
and sets attack goals. (ii) Weaponization: An attacker writes
persuasive and emotional messages (e.g., asking for COVID-
19 donations) to trick victims, creates fake social media pro-
ﬁles, and creates social media groups to lure target audience.
(iii) Delivery: An attacker sends malicious messages, website
links, and attachments through messaging to targeted victims,
sends scams mentioning ﬁnes for leaving home during stay-at-
home orders [9], sends fraud messages with free subscription
lures for media streaming services [7], sends messages to
low-quality supplies (e.g., masks, gloves, fake cures,
sell
and illegal chemical materials) [25], sends COVID-19 related
lucrative offers (e.g., giveaways,
lawyer help, food
stamps, stimulus check updates, news guidelines), and sends
crafted misinformation messages with fake claims and made
up evidence. (iv) Exploitation: A victim trusts a received
message and falls victim to it by clicking its malicious links,
downloading its malicious contents, and forwarding it to other
users. (v) Installation: A victim intentionally or unintention-
ally installs the malicious payload on an messaging device
(e.g. Android mobile phone). (vi) C2: An attacker establishes
channels (e.g., reply messages, servers connected to a phishing
webpage) to remotely control the compromised messaging
devices, for example, to receive victims’ sensitive information.
(vii) Objectives: An attacker gets victims’ sensitive informa-
tion or makes lateral movements in victims’ networks.

E. COVID-19 Themed Misinformation

Attackers have waged COVID-19 attacks to spread mis-
information, which includes false or inaccurate information
(e.g., hoaxes, rumors, or propaganda [26]). Examples include:
“COVID-19 is invented in a Chinese lab [27]”; “5G is spread-
ing COVID-19 [28]”, “Black are immune to COVID-19 [29]”,
“X can cure COVID-19” where X can be a drug or food
items (i.e., Ginger) [30], or “Wearing a mask causes you to
inhale too much carbon dioxide, which can make you sick” or
“Wearing a mask can result in getting pneumonia” [31]. Social
media and messaging platforms further increase the impact
of such misinformation. The term Infodemic has even been
coined because of this [32]. We map the COVID-19 themed
misinformation attack to the Cyber Kill Chain as follows.

(i) Reconnaissance: An attacker analyzes the characteristics
of targeted audience (e.g., ethnicity, demography or national-
ity), identiﬁes vulnerable divisions in society, selects themed
topics, and sets attack goals. (ii) Weaponization: An attacker
writes fake COVID-19 themed statements and mix them with
false evidence and out-of-context truths, creates fake groups

in social networking platforms, creates themed memes, creates
bots in social media (e.g., Twitter) to propagate misinfor-
mation, and inﬁltrates into social media groups containing
targeted ethnic audience. (iii) Delivery: An attacker posts
and shares COVID-19 related misinformation (e.g., narratives,
memes, images, and hashtags through social media groups
and messaging apps) and publishes fake news on paid online
news/tabloids, and/or keeps posting to a larger audience with
bots to amplify the impact. (iv) Exploitation: A victims
(e.g., social media user) reads and forwards misinformation
messages. (v) Installation: A victims gets to believe the
misinformation which goes viral. (vi) C2: An attacker may
generate fake real-life incidents/experience posts on social
media related to COVID-19. (vii) Objectives: An attacker
succeeds when bringing more division, mistrust, health crisis,
and chaos in society, and possibly earns money from the crisis.

F. Systematizing COVID-19 Themed Cyberattacks

We systematize COVID-19 attacks by mapping them to their
attack techniques and attack goals, and by contrasting their
Cyber Kill Chain models.

1) Mapping Attacks, Techniques and Goals: Figure 1 de-
picts the mapping between the COVID-19 attacks, the attack
techniques they use, and their attack goals. We observe that
one attack may use multiple attack techniques. For example,
a COVID-19 themed malicious website attack may use a
range of attack techniques, including phishing, malware, ran-
somware, vaccine scams, donation scams, masks scams, test-
ing scams, and VPN scams. Moreover, a COVID-19 themed
malicious website attack may have multiple goals. On the
other hand, one goal can be achieved by using various kinds
of attack techniques, which may be waged through multiple
classes of attacks. This means that when an attacker attempt
to achieve an attack goal, the attacker can choose attacks and
attack techniques in a cost-effective, if not optimal, fashion.
For example, each attack may incur some cost or risk (e.g.,
the cost for using phishing via COVID-19 themed malicious
websites and COVID-19 themed malicious emails may be
different), and may have different success probabilities (e.g.,
phishing via COVID-19 themed malicious websites may be
more or less successful than phishing via COVID-19 themed
malicious emails). This would allow an intelligent attacker to
wage the cost-effective or event optimal attack. A systematic
framework for achieving this type of attacker decision-making
is beyond the scope of the present paper.

Insight 1: A COVID-19 attack may use multiple attack
techniques to achieve multiple attack goals, and an attack
goal may be achieved by using multiple attack techniques
that can correspond to multiple attacks. This ﬂexibility allows
the attacker to choose cost-effective, if not optimal, attacks in
order to achieve a certain attack goal.

2) Systematizing Attacks via Their Cyber Kill Chains:
Figure 2 depicts the Cyber Kill Chain mappings of the
aforementioned 5 classes of COVID-19 attacks, which are
represented by different colors. We observe that in each stage
of the Cyber Kill Chain, there can be multiple tactics (e.g.,

at the reconnaissance stage). We observe that the 5 classes of
COVID-19 attacks would use some common tactics at some
stages as well as their distinct tactics at other stages. For
example, “select target audience” at the reconnaissance stage
is a tactic that can be used by the 5 classes of attacks, but “ﬁnd
unregulated app stores” is a tactic that would be unique to the
COVID-19 themed malicious apps attack. We also observe
that the exploitation stage almost always leverages victims’
mistrust in social engineering, which highlights that human
factor remains to be a critical vulnerability in COVID-19
attacks, which reinforces the importance of seeking effective
defenses against such attacks [33].

Insight 2: COVID-19 attacks can be very sophisticated,
rather than only opportunistic, which means that effective
defense must be designed on a deeper understanding about
the attack tactics that can be used in each stage of the attack
(i.e., knowing the attacker better).

III. EXPLORING THE DEFENSE SPACE

The preceding characterization of COVID-19 attacks guides
us to explore defense strategies against them, with an emphasis
on what-to-leverage when designing defense systems. The
investigation of these proposed approaches is beyond the scope
of the present paper. This is because each approach needs to
be investigated separately, with corresponding experiments.

A. COVID-19 Malicious Websites Defense

We propose four approaches to defending against COVID-
19 themed malicious websites. The ﬁrst approach is to lever-
age various website contents pertinent to COVID-19. What
is unique to content-based detection of COVID-19 themed
malicious websites is the COVID-19 related features, such as
the presence or absence of keywords in website names (e.g.,
coronavirus, COVID-19, masks, n95, and test). The second
approach is to leverage website environment, including URLs’
information. For example, typo-squatting URLs or mimicking
fake websites can be detected by analyzing URLs information
and website screenshots. The third approach is to leverage
websites’ age information. Since COVID-19 themed malicious
websites would be created after the outbreak of the COVID-
19 pandemic, hinting that the lifetime of many such websites
would be short. The fourth approach is to leverage effective
training to make users more skeptical about website contents.

B. COVID-19 Malicious Emails Defense

We propose three approaches to defending against COVID-
19 themed malicious emails. The ﬁrst approach is to ﬁlter
emails by searching COVID-19 themed keywords in their
subject lines and contents. Examples of such keywords in-
clude: COVID-19 cures, COVID-19 guidelines, and COVID-
19 offers. The second approach is to verify the sender email
address to detect email masquerading [34]. The third approach
is to leverage email content, for example by analyzing their
attachments, links and texts.

C. COVID-19 Malicious Mobile Apps Defense

We propose four approaches to defending against COVID-
19 themed malicious apps. The ﬁrst approach is to leverage
computer vision to proactively examine newly published app’s
logos, especially when they are similar to, if not exactly the
same as,
the logos of some popular legitimate apps. The
second approach is to analyze the content of apps to detect
the malicious ones (e.g., repackaged apps). For this purpose,
static analysis, dynamic analysis, and their combinations may
be utilized. The third approach is to examine the string edit
distance of app names with respect to some popular ones. The
fourth approach is to train users to improve their awareness
of malicious apps according to some best practices in using
mobile apps securely [35].

D. COVID-19 Malicious Messaging Defense

We propose three approaches to defending against COVID-
19 themed malicious messaging. The ﬁrst approach is to
leverage message content
to check if a message contains
suspicious content (e.g., the presence of URLs, emoticons,
special characters, and COVID-19 themed keywords). The sec-
ond approach is to detect persuasive messages waging social
engineering cyberattacks. This may be achieved by analyzing
texts and leveraging human factors and psychological means
[33]. The third approach is to train users to improve their
awareness of COVID-19 themed malicious messages.

E. COVID-19 Misinformation Defense

We propose four approaches to defending against COVID-
19 themed misinformation attacks. The ﬁrst approach is to
use fact-checking to detect fake news (or social media posts),
perhaps using similar news reports from credible sources and
AI or machine learning techniques. The second approach is
to use central repositories to host COVID-19 related informa-
tion and resources (e.g., Facebook’s COVID-19 Information
Center). The third approach is to train and educate users to
improve their skills and capabilities in recognizing fake misin-
formation. The fourth approach is to leverage crowdsourcing,
namely encouraging or incentivizing users to report COVID-
19 suspicious misinformation posts and links.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have explored the landscape of COVID-19 themed
cyberattacks and defenses. We discussed 5 classes of attacks
and mapped them to the Cyber Kill Chain model. We ex-
plored defense strategies against these attacks. Although the
study is geared towards COVID-19 themed cyberattacks, the
exploration and landscape can be adapted to future X-themed
cyberattacks exploiting future events (e.g., election, natural
or man-made disasters). It is also interesting to rigorously
model these attack-defense interactions in the Cybersecurity
Dynamics framework [36]–[39].
