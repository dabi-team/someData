Abstract 
The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  envisions  pervasive,  connected,  and  smart  nodes  interacting 
autonomously while offering all sorts of services. Wide distribution, openness and relatively high 
processing power of IoT objects made them an ideal target for cyber attacks. Moreover, as many 
of IoT nodes are collecting and processing private information, they are becoming a goldmine of 
data for malicious actors. Therefore, security and specifically the ability to detect compromised 
nodes,  together  with    collecting  and  preserving  evidences  of  an  attack  or  malicious  activities 
emerge as a priority in successful deployment of IoT networks. In this paper, we first introduce 
existing  major  security  and  forensics  challenges  within  IoT  domain  and  then  briefly  discuss 
about papers published in this special issue targeting identified challenges.

1.  Introduction 

The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates various sensors, objects and smart nodes that are capable 
of communicating with each other without human intervention [1] . The objects/things function 
autonomously in connection with other objects. IoT nodes are capable of delivering lightweight 
data,  accessing  and  authorizing  cloud-based  resources  for  collecting  and  extracting  data  and 
making  decisions  by  analysing  collected  data.  The  emergence  of  IoT  has  led  to  pervasive 
connection  of  people,  services,  sensors  and  objects.  IoT  devices  are  now  deployed  in  a  wide 
range of applications from smart grids to healthcare and intelligence transport systems [2]. Huge 
business  opportunities  that  exist  within  IoT  domain  significantly  increased  number  of  smart 
devices and intelligent, autonomous services offered in IoT networks. Moreover, reliance of IoT 
devices  on  cloud  infrastructure  for  data  transfer,  storage  and  analysis  led  to  development  of 
cloud-enabled IoT networks [3].  
Security issues such as  privacy, access control, secure communication and secure storage of data 
are becoming significant challenges in IoT environment [4]. Moreover, every single device that 
we create, every new sensor that we deploy, and every single byte that is synchronized within an 
IoT environment may at some point come under scrutiny in the course of an investigation. 
The fast growth of IoT devices and services led to deployment of many vulnerable and insecure 
nodes [5]. Moreover,  conventional user-driven security architectures are of little use in object-
driven IoT networks [6]. Therefore, we require specialised tools, techniques and procedures for

securing  IoT  networks  and  collecting,  preserving  and  analysing  residual  evidences  of  IoT 
environments. In this special issue we sought new and unpublished works in the domain of IoT 
security and forensics.  
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we briefly discuss about 
security challenges in IoT environment. In Section 3, we provide a brief discussion of forensics 
challenges within IoT networks. We offer a brief review of accepted articles in this special issue 
in Section 4, and finally conclude the paper.    

2.  Security Challenges in IoT Environments  

Wide distribution of  IoT nodes and private nature of data that  are collected and transferred by 
IoT  devices  made  security  a  major  challenge.  In  this  section,  we  are  briefly  looking  at  major 
security challenges that exist in IoT environments.   

2.1. Authentication 

In  IoT  domain,  authentication  allows  integration  of  different  IoT  devices  that  are  deployed  in 
different contexts. Authentication process involves authentication of routing peers that involve in 
transferring  data  as  well  as  authentication  of  the  source  of  data  route  (data  origin  node)  [7].  
Efficient key deployment and key management is a challenge in IoT devices authentication. Any 
cryptographic key generation and key exchange should not cause a major overhead on IoT nodes 
[8]. Moreover, in the absence of a guaranteed Certificate Authority (CA), other mechanisms are 
required for validating cryptographic keys and ensuring integrity of key transfer. 

2.2 Authorisation and Access Control 

Authorisation involves specification of access rights to different resources while Access Control 
mechanisms should guarantee access right of only authorised resources [9]. Each and every IoT 
node may only support limited mechanisms for access verification which could be different from 
other  connected  objects  to  the  same  node  [10].  Therefore,  deployment  and  management  of  a 
variety  of  authorisation  and  access  control  mechanisms  which  are  tailored  to  different  nodes 
capabilities is a challenge in a heterogeneous IoT network [11].   

2.3 Privacy  

Deployment of autonomous objects in IoT that sense people private information (such as health 
data) pose a new level of threat to individuals' privacy. Unlike conventional scenarios in which 
users have to take some actions (i.e. searching for a keyword or posting some data) to put their 
privacy at stake, IoT nodes are collecting people's private data without them even noticing [12]. 
Existing  mechanisms  are  providing  user  centric  privacy,  content  oriented  privacy  or  context 
oriented  privacy.  However,  IoT  networks  are  naturally  contains  autonomous  nodes  that  collect 
information  and  require  object-oriented  privacy  models.  Moreover,  majority  of  privacy 
regulations  mandate  keeping  users  informed  about  how  their  private  data  is  managed  and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
administered.  Identifying  nodes  that  may  have  access  to  passively  collected  users’  private 
information is a huge challenge in heterogeneous IoT networks [13]. 

2.4 Secure Architecture  

Building an architecture that overcomes aforementioned security challenges in IoT environments 
is not trivial. Any IoT architecture should not only address previously mentioned security issues 
but  deal  with  challenges  that  are  introduced  by  deploying  IoT  devices  over  Software  Defined 
Networks (SDN) and cloud infrastructure [14] . Majority of SDN and cloud environment security 
issues  would  inevitability  inherited  to  underlying  IoT  sensors.  Moreover,  Complexities  that 
to  data-oriented  cloud 
involve 
infrastructures would introduce many unprecedented security challenges [15]. Finally, detection 
of malicious traffics rerouted over networks with different natures (i.e. SDN, Cloud and IoT) and 
hunting  for  malicious  actors  is  a  very  challenging  task  for  existing  intrusion  detection  and 
prevention systems [16].

3.  Forensics Challenges in IoT Environments  

IoT would soon pervade all aspects of our life from managing our home temperature to thinking 
cars and smart management of the cities. So it won’t take long to see people suing each other for 
misusing  their  smart  things,  thinking  cars  that  have  accident  and  attackers  who  compromised 
smart  sensors.  The  Internet  of  everything  is  developing  a  haystack  which  contains  lots  of 
valuable  forensics  artefacts  while  identification,  collection,  preservation  and  reporting  of 
evidences as well as attack or deficit attribution would be challenging in this environment. In this 
section we briefly introduce main forensics challenges in IoT environments.  

3.1 Evidence Identification, Collection and Preservation 

Search  and  seizure  is  an  important  step  in  any  forensics  examination.  However,  detecting 
presence  of  IoT  systems  is  quite  a  challenge  considering  these  devices  are  designed  to  work 
passively and autonomously [17]! Even, in most cases when an IoT device is identified there is 
no  documented  method  or  a  reliable  tool  to  collect  residual  evidences  from  the  device  in  a 
forensically  sound  manner  [18].  Moreover,  there  are  very  limited  methods  to  create  forensic 
image  of  a  given  IoT  device  ignoring  ethical  considerations  when  collecting  evidences  from 
devices running in a multi-tenancy environment. 
While preservation of collected data using traditional techniques such as hashing is not difficult, 
preservation  of  the  scene  is  an  enormous  challenge  in  an  IoT  environment.  Real-time  and 
autonomous interactions between different nodes, would make it very difficult if not impossible 
to identify scope of a compromise and boundaries of a crime scene.  

3.2 Evidence Analysis and Correlation 

Majority of IoT nodes are not storing any metadata including temporal information which makes 
provenance of evidences a challenge for an investigator! In the absence of temporal information 

 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
such  as  modified,  accessed  and  created  time,  correlation  of  evidences  gathered  from  different 
IoT  devices  is  almost  impossible.  Beyond  technical  challenges,  privacy  is  a  major  issue  to 
consider when analysing and correlating collected data especially as majority of IoT sensors are 
collecting  innate  personal  information  [19].  Moreover,  the  sheer  volume  of  data  that  are 
collected in heterogeneous IoT environments make it close to impossible to provide an end-to-
end analysis of residual evidences.    

3.3 Attack or Deficit Attribution  

A common outcome of any forensics investigation is to identify criminal actors or liabilities of 
involved  parties  in  the  case  of    an  incident.  With  fast  rate  of  development  in  autonomous 
vehicles industry identifying liabilities of different parties (i.e. human driver or car autonomous 
driving system) in an accident would soon become a cyber forensics challenge! Answering such 
questions  would  be  impossible  in  the  absence  of  documented  methods  and  forensically  sound 
tools for collection, preservation and analysis of cyber physical systems data [20]. Moreover, in 
the  absence  of  a  proper  authentication  system,  identifying  activities  and  liabilities  of  different 
parties  having  access  to  an  IoT  node  would  be  challenging.  Finally,  attribution  of  malicious 
activities detected in an IoT environment even in the possession of evidences is quite challenging 
in the absence of a reliable and secure architecture that guarantees a forensically sound logging 
and monitoring system.    

4.  A Brief Review of Accepted Articles of this Special Issue 

In this special issue we have accepted three papers in the domains of IoT privacy, IoT forensics 
and security in SDN-based IoT networks.  
The first paper is Privacy-Preserving Protocols for Secure and Reliable Data Aggregation in IoT-
Enabled Smart Metering Systems by Samet Tonyali, et al. [21]. This paper tackles privacy issues 
raised by frequent data collection of smart metering systems. Current systems achieve privacy by 
concealing aggregated in-network data using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and secure 
MultiParty  Computation  (secure  MPC).  However,  both  FHE  and  secure  MPC  are  producing 
overhead in IoT environments. Therefore,  Samet Tonyali, et al. [21] suggested a new protocol 
which  utilises  FHE  and  secure  MPC  in  Smart  Grid  (SG)  Advanced  Metering  Infrastructure 
(AMI)  to  reduce  overheads  while  providing  a  viable  privacy-preserving  data  aggregation 
mechanism. 
The Digital Forensic Intelligence: Data Subsets and Open Source Intelligence (DFINT+OSINT): 
a  Timely  and  Cohesive  Mix  paper  by  Darren  Quick  and  Kim-Kwang  Raymond  Choo  [22] 
addresses  the  issue  of  analysing  big  digital  forensics  data  resulted  from  investigation  of  IoT 
objects.  The  paper  presents  a  framework  for  entity  identification  and  open  source  information 
cohesion  within  digital  forensics  domain.  Authors  analysis  using  real  world  data  demonstrated 
benefits of their framework in real world investigations. 
The last paper of this special issue, has suggested a mechanism to change attack surface in SDN-
based IoT networks to increase attackers efforts for a successful exploitation. Internet of Things; 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Software-Defined Networking; Attack Graphs;Security Modeling by Mengmeng Ge, et al. [23] 
utilised  SDN  to  reconfigure  IoT  network  topology  as  a  proactive  defense  mechanism.  Their 
simulated results showed how their mechanisms increased attackers efforts while maintained the 
average shortest path length in a SDN-IoT network.  

5.  Conclusion 

The  fast  pace  of  development  and  nature  of  IoT  environments  bring  a  variety  of  security  and 
forensics  challenges.    In  this  paper,  we  briefly  presented  major  security  and  forensics  issues 
along with potentially promising solutions. Papers included in this special issue offer state of art 
view  of  privacy,  security  and  forensics  challenges  in  IoT  environments  along  with  innovative 
solutions that paves the way towards secure and forensically sound deployment of IoT networks.
