Abstract—In the last years, Cyber Ranges have become a
widespread solution to train professionals for responding to cyber
threats and attacks. Cloud computing plays a key role in this
context since it enables the creation of virtual infrastructures
on which Cyber Ranges are based. However, the setup and
management of Cyber Ranges are expensive and time-consuming
activities. In this paper, we highlight the novel features for
the next-generation Cyber Range platforms. In particular, these
features include the creation of a virtual clone for an actual
corporate infrastructure, relieving the security managers from
the setup of the training scenarios and sessions, the automatic
monitoring of the participants’ activities, and the emulation of
their behavior.

Index Terms—Cyber Range, Cloud computing, Security

I. INTRODUCTION

NIST deﬁnes Cyber Ranges as “interactive, simulated plat-
forms and representations of networks, systems, tools, and
applications that are connected to a simulated Internet level
environment”. They provide a safe, legal environment to gain
hands-on cyber skills and a secure environment for product
development and security posture testing. A Cyber Range may
include actual hardware and software or be a combination
of actual and virtual components” [22]. Nowadays, there are
several technologies capable of supporting Cyber Ranges. The
majority of them are based on cloud computing to create
virtual infrastructures, including hosts, subnets, and services,
which deﬁne the training environment. Cloud computing en-
ables the use of large data centers at affordable costs to
simulate large networks. Examples of these solutions are
KYPO [15], the National Cyber Range [25], Redcloud [10].
However, the creation and the management of Cyber Ranges
are cumbersome tasks, in terms of time and costs. Indeed,
Cyber Range organizers need to create and conﬁgure the ma-
chines and networks to be used for training, to deploy services,
data, and workloads that emulate the actual infrastructure of
the organization realistically. Moreover,
they have to deal
with the analysis of the participants’ activities to provide
them feedback, and engage large groups of people from the
company to take the roles required by the Cyber Range
(e.g., blue teams for defense, red teams for the attack, white
teams for monitoring). All these activities involve a signiﬁcant
amount of personnel (e.g., in terms of man-hours), which
makes the world of the Cyber Ranges not easily approachable
for companies and organizations.

We strongly believe that the next generation Cyber Ranges
should reduce the effort of the managers in the setup of these

platforms and ease the management and monitoring of all the
related activities to work in a better way. Hence the need to
introduce new technologies to overcome the limitations to the
adoption and diffusion of Cyber Ranges. This paper focuses
on the next generation Cyber Range platform, which should
provide the creation and management of Cyber Ranges in an
efﬁcient way and with limited costs. The platform will be
based on:

• Advanced hypervisor-level technologies for monitoring

and analyzing the activities of the participants;

• Statistical and AI techniques to learn the features of cor-
porate infrastructure and automatically generate scenarios
based on that information;

• AI techniques to simulate the participants to allow smaller

teams to use Cyber Ranges.

The solution will enable exercise environments with high
complexity (in terms of number and heterogeneity of services,
network elements, etc.) to emulate the ICT systems realisti-
cally employed by companies. These emulated infrastructures
are meant to be highly ﬂexible, easy to manage and conﬁgure
(e.g., by providing visual interfaces), and to allow managers
to monitor the activities of the users.

In the reminder of this paper, Section II shows a background
analysis of Cyber Ranges along with the open research prob-
lems, Section III discusses the research proposal, Section IV
concludes the paper.

II. BACKGROUND

• Simulation Ranges run in virtual

Cyber Ranges can be classiﬁed into different categories,
based on their features and capabilities. NIST identiﬁes four
main types of Cyber Ranges in its Cyber Range Guide [22]:
instances, without
the need for any physical network equipment. Virtual
machines (VM) are used to replicate the server, network,
and storage conﬁguration of speciﬁc infrastructure. These
VMs are based on standardized templates, so their ﬁdelity
in replicating the target infrastructure may be limited.
• Overlay Ranges run on top of real networks. They grant a
more signiﬁcant level of ﬁdelity than Simulation Ranges
but,
is greater, along
with the risk of compromising the underlying network
infrastructure. Overlay Ranges grant very low ﬂexibility,
because a slight change in the conﬁguration may cause
the redeﬁnition of the entire Cyber Range. An example

in terms of hardware,

the cost

 
 
 
 
 
 
of an overlay network is the Global Environment for
Network Innovations (GENI) [23], sponsored by the
National Science Foundation.

• Emulation Ranges run on dedicated network infrastruc-
tures, mapping the speciﬁc network/server/storage conﬁg-
uration onto them. The physical infrastructure becomes
the Cyber Range itself. Emulation Ranges include trafﬁc
generation, with the possibility of emulating trafﬁc ﬂows,
speciﬁc patterns, attacks, etc. The National Cyber Range
(NCR) [25], the Michigan Cyber Range [16] and DETER
[7] are examples of the Emulation Range initiative.

• Hybrid Ranges can be deﬁned as a customized combina-
tion of the aforementioned types of Cyber Ranges: they
combine the advantages of the other types of Ranges,
such as the high ﬁdelity of Overlay Ranges and the
ﬂexibility of Emulation Ranges. An example of this type
of Range is the Virginia Cyber Range [5].

Cyber Range environment, teaming represents the group of
professionals that design, develop, manage and participate in
a training session. Teams are identiﬁed by different colors
according to their roles during the exercise. The red team is the
one that plays the role of the attackers, trying to violate the se-
curity of the environment by exploiting its vulnerabilities. The
blue team covers the defensive role, with the responsibility to
identify and ﬁx potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited
by the red team. The white team designs the scenario organizes
the exercise and sets the rules of engagement between the red
and blue team.

III. PROPOSAL

The research activity presented in this paper aims to de-
velop new Cyber Range techniques which will be integrated
into a next-generation platform. This platform will have the
following properties:

Yamin et al. [32] proposed a different classiﬁcation of the
Cyber Ranges, deﬁning a taxonomy of the main Cyber Range-
related concepts: scenarios, monitoring, and management.

Scenario. It deﬁnes the execution context of a training ex-
ercise. and can be seen as the combination of the following
elements: purpose, environment, storyline, type, and domain.
The purpose explains the goals of the scenario, which are
necessary to develop the environment. The environment is the
topology in which the scenario is executed, it can be either
a technical infrastructure or a non-computer-based one. The
storyline tells one or more stories about how the exercise is
executed and describes the events and actions that constitute
the scenario and how these are linked to deﬁne the narrative.
The type of the scenario inﬂuences the nature of the environ-
ment and the storyline. The type of a scenario can be static
or dynamic. Also, the domain of the scenario is an essential
aspect: some examples of application domain are IoT, network,
cloud, etc.

Monitoring. It is the set of methods, tools, and layers at which
real-time monitoring of training sessions is performed [28].
The methods employed to monitor training exercises can be
automatic, thanks to the use of speciﬁc tools (intrusion de-
tection systems, security information, and event management,
etc.), or manual, performed by human observers. Monitoring
can be performed at different layers. Depending on the type
of exercise, it is possible to monitor the session at multiple
TCP/IP layers or an abstract social layer.

Management. The management of a Cyber Range involves
many different activities, from role management during train-
ing sessions to resource and range management. All of these
aspects of management
impact on the development of a
training exercise: role management is related to the assignment
of roles to individuals and teams during a training exercise,
resource management deals with the allocation of memory,
disk, and network resources needed to perform the exercise
and, ﬁnally, range management is associated to how the results
of the training exercise are presented to the managers. In a

• Instantiation of large scale virtual network scenarios,
using several amounts of computing resources available
in the datacenters through cloud computing;

• Clonation of a corporate infrastructure inside the virtual
scenario, to simulate realistically the users, resources,
processes, and network trafﬁc of such infrastructure.
This replica will be used for training exercises without
impacting on the actual one;

• Ease of management for new training scenarios (e.g., new
network topologies, vulnerabilities conﬁguration, etc.)
by providing the managers with a high-level domain-
speciﬁc language to describe and design highly complex
scenarios, along with APIs and visual dashboards;

• Silent and automatic monitoring of the activities of the
participants, using Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI)
techniques at the hypervisor level, in order to provide the
managers and the participants with detailed feedback;
• Actor simulation (attackers/defenders) through AI tech-
niques, in order to help the staff involved in the training
and allow small groups of people to complete training
sessions successfully, even when they cannot cover all
the required roles.

Fig. 1 shows an overview of the next generation Cyber
Range platform. It is possible to notice how the Cyber Range
replicates the actual infrastructure, after learning its features,
providing a virtual clone of it. In this way, all the training
exercises will be performed without impacting the actual in-
frastructure. The replica also provides an automatic monitoring
system, in order to silently track all the events that occur
in the training sessions and the activities of the participants.
Moreover, the Cyber Range offers the possibility to support
the staff (i.e., instructors and trainees) involved in the training
sessions with emulated teams and actors.

The innovation degree of our proposal can be considered
extremely high: from the technological point of view because
of the development of new systems based on cloud computing
and hypervisor technologies; from the methodological one be-
cause these solutions will leverage statistical and AI techniques
to improve the realism of the training exercises. The research

activity will be carried out in three different phases, explained
in the following.

scenarios, without the need of modeling and replicating every
single detail of the target infrastructure.

The statistical model will grant the conﬁdentiality of sensi-
ble data, because the simulation will generate a different and
anonymized version of the infrastructure, along with its users,
resources, and trafﬁc. This task will be accomplished with
the integration of advanced techniques to simulate realistically
the users, resources, processes, and network trafﬁc of the
corporate infrastructure. These techniques will be based on
the data gathered from the target infrastructure, which will be
used to deﬁne a statistical model that reﬂects the behavior
of the users and the resource distribution. Both statistical
techniques, such as graphs and Markovian models, and modern
techniques,
like deep neural networks, will be taken into
account to complete this task. The model will be used to
generate training scenarios on the virtual infrastructure, which
will be representative of the actual one but also anonymized
to protect sensitive information. The simulated scenarios will
be easy to manage, thanks to visual dashboards and APIs, ﬁt
to support a Cyber Range-oriented workﬂow. The dashboards
will allow the managers to visually interact with the virtual
infrastructures, providing them with a set of conﬁgurable
vulnerabilities which can be used to create new scenarios in
which the red and blue teams will challenge each other.

B. Monitoring techniques

The aim of the second phase is the creation of a hypervisor-
based monitoring system to track and analyze the activities of
the red and blue teams. These activities, such as connection to
a speciﬁc node, attack trafﬁc generation, malicious code exe-
cution, etc. will be monitored silently, through Virtual Machine
Introspection techniques. VMI describes the act of examining
and monitoring the virtual machine (i.e., the state of the guest
OS) from the vantage point of the hypervisor or a second
privileged guest OS [26]. Three properties of virtualization
enable and support Virtual Machine Introspection, namely
isolation, inspection, and interposition. Speciﬁcally, isolation
is the property that states that ideally the hypervisor cannot
be tampered with; inspection refers to the property that allows
the VMM to examine the entire state of the guest OS without
having to rely on a possibly compromised system for this
information; and, ﬁnally, interposition is the ability to inject
operations into the normal running of the system based on
certain conditions [9]. To be able to rely on the advantages
that VMI brings, the hypervisor must not be vulnerable to
compromise. Due to the strong isolation properties provided
by the hypervisor, the number of attack vectors on the external
monitoring components is signiﬁcantly reduced compared to
software running inside the monitored VM [26].

The hypervisor enables the interception of events in the
guest OS, by taking advantage of dynamic probing mecha-
nisms provided by most modern commodity OSes (such as
DTrace for FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Solaris [12], SystemTap
and Kprobes for Linux [3], [4], and Detours for Microsoft
Windows [31]) [6]. These mechanisms can collect information
from the kernel through the use of speciﬁc functions and

Fig. 1. Overview of the next-generation Cyber Range platform

A. Advanced scenario simulation

The ﬁrst phase of the research activity will focus on the
replication of corporate infrastructure, creating a digital twin
[14], [29]. This replica will be easy to access and use, in terms
of management, conﬁguration, and monitoring, according to
twin of a
the ”as-a-service” paradigm. Creating a digital
corporate infrastructure means deﬁning and building a virtual
infrastructure that simulates realistically its users, resources,
processes, and network trafﬁc. This virtual infrastructure will
be deﬁned using a statistical model, which will capture in-
formation on the services features and network topologies in
order to replicate similar features in the virtual infrastructure.
The digital twin will be created by instantiating large-scale
virtual scenarios, using huge amounts of computing resources
supplied by the companies data centers through cloud com-
puting technologies. The emulation of the infrastructure and
its users, resources, processes, and network trafﬁc should be
as realistic as possible, with the possibility to perform reliable
security training without impacting on the real one.

The main goal of this phase is the realization of a custom
engine, which allows the managers to model complex training
scenarios using a domain-speciﬁc language. This high-level
language will be used to design the services, resources, be-
haviors, and vulnerabilities. The engine will convert the high-
level description of the scenarios in low-level operations on
the infrastructure, through the state-of-the-art technologies for
Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-code. It will
be based on the cloud computing platform OpenStack [24], a
de facto standard technology, using its API to create complex
network scenarios (hundreds of network elements, e.g., hosts,
routers, switches, ﬁrewalls, etc.). Moreover, the engine will be
equipped with a repository of host conﬁgurations to emulate
network servers and clients that will generate realistic trafﬁc
ﬂows. To achieve a high level of realism, the platform will
support the proﬁling of the existing corporate infrastructures
to create a statistical descriptive model, which will be used to
set up a virtual infrastructure. In this way, the Cyber Range
managers will be facilitated in designing realistic training

breakpoints: for example, a breakpoint can be used to probe
the invocations of an API function. The run-time the overhead
of these probing mechanisms is low enough to be applicable
in many applications: for example, benchmarks from VMware
reported that, in the worst cases, dynamic probes cause a
throughput loss between 3% and 4.5% [2].

These techniques will make monitoring activities non-
intrusive and invisible to the teams, in order to grant a higher
level of realism during training. Moreover, these techniques
will relieve the managers of the host management burden,
allowing them to avoid the installation of new processes or
the alteration of the network conﬁguration. The monitoring
system will be implemented as modules for the Linux/KVM
hypervisor [13], or other hypervisors of interest, e.g., VMware
ESXi [30]. The data gathered by the monitoring system will be
used to automatically analyze the behavior of the participants,
through statistical ﬁtting techniques, clustering, and time series
analysis. These techniques will enable the automation of the
evaluation tasks and the provision of detailed feedback, which
would require a huge effort from the white teams.

C. Actor simulation through AI techniques

The last phase of the research proposal will concern the
development of software agents capable of simulating the
actions of the actors, both from the offensive (connection
attempts, trafﬁc snifﬁng, vulnerability scanning) and defensive
side (ﬁrewall, network segmentation, and services reconﬁg-
uration). These automated actors will be controlled through
machine learning algorithms, such as reinforcement learning,
which will carry out speciﬁc sequences of actions to maximize
the probability of bringing the system in the desired state.
A solution based on such techniques is CyberBattleSim [18],
developed by Microsoft. This paradigm is similar to the one
used by artiﬁcial intelligence systems to learn how to win
a competition, e.g., AlphaGo by Google DeepMind [11]. To
increase the effectiveness of such techniques, the aforemen-
tioned monitoring system will be used to provide feedback to
the algorithms to guide their training.

Actor simulation is closely related to the concept of ad-
versary emulation: a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures
(TTPs) act to simulate the presence and the actions of a hostile
subject inside the network [20]. Adversary emulation is useful
to measure the ability of the network itself to identify threats
and prevent damages to its devices. Adversary emulation tools
should be intelligent, realistic, modular and they should grant
a low overhead. Adversary emulation represents an advantage
for both red and blue teams. Like Cyber Range-based en-
gagements, Adversary emulation activities are costly and time
consuming, involving a signiﬁcant amount of staff to set up
the red team and identify the adversary’s tactics, techniques
and procedures (TTPs). To address this issue, many solutions
known as Automated threat emulators have been proposed.
Zilberman et al. [33] carried out an exhaustive analysis of the
most popular threat emulators, ranked according to several
criteria, e.g. coverage of the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise
Matrix [21]. Among these threat emulators we ﬁnd MITRE

CALDERA [19], [1], Atomic Red Team [27], Red Team
Automation [8] and Metasploit [17].

These solutions are very useful to automatically test the
offensive and defensive strategies during training. However,
there is room for further improvement of such tools. To address
this matter, the study will focus on the integration of AI
techniques to enable the system to learn how to defend the
infrastructure from all types of threat agents.

D. Status of the dissertation research

The dissertation research is still at an early stage. During the
ﬁrst year, I will develop my own techniques to create virtual-
ized environments for representative Cyber Ranges, along with
the experimentation of the current adversary emulation tools.
During the second year, my work will focus on hypervisor-
level techniques for monitoring and attack simulation. Finally,
during the third year, I will work on the AI techniques for
actor simulation.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we describe a research proposal for the
development of a next-generation Cyber Range platform. This
novel platform aims to facilitate the creation and management
of Cyber Ranges and to reduce the related costs. Our proposal
consists of three different phases concerning a critical aspect of
the platform: the advanced scenario simulation, the monitoring
techniques, and, ﬁnally, the actor simulation. The platform
will allow the companies to test the cyber-security aspects
of their infrastructure on a virtual clone in order to provide
high ﬂexibility, ease of management and conﬁguration, highly
realistic scenario generation, automatic monitoring, and actor
simulation.
