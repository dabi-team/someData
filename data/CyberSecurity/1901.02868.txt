Abstract:  Its constant technological evolution characterizes the contemporary  world, and every 
day the processes, once manual, become computerized. Data are stored in the cyberspace, and as 
a consequence, one must increase the concern with the security of this environment. Cyber-attacks 
are  represented  by  a  growing  worldwide  scale  and  are  characterized  as  one  of  the  significant 
challenges of the century. This article aims to propose a computational system based on intelligent 
hybrid models, which through fuzzy rules allows the construction of expert systems in cybernetic data 
attacks,  focusing  on  the  SQL  Injection  attack.  The  tests  were  performed  with  real  bases  of  SQL 
Injection  attacks  on  government  computers,  using  fuzzy  neural  networks.  According  to  the  results 
obtained, the feasibility of constructing a system based on fuzzy rules, with the classification accuracy 
of cybernetic invasions within the margin of the standard deviation (compared to the state-of-the-art 
model in solving this type of problem) is real. The model helps countries prepare to protect their data 
networks and information systems, as well as create opportunities for expert systems to automate the 
identification of attacks in cyberspace. 

Key  words:    Cyberspace,  Cyber-defense,  Information  security,  Fuzzy  neural  networks,  SQL 
Injection.  

I. Introduction 

The  technological  race 
is  one  of  the  most 
discussed  topics  in  the  world  today,  generating 
great tools for commerce, industries, automation, 
service, 
communication, 
governments,  among  other  vital  sectors  of  the 
economy [1]. As a result, the search for high-speed 

schools,  military 

traffic  dangerous  and  subject 

information processing and transmission and high 
system performance tends to move in parallel with 
the  security  and  integrity  of  the  data,  making 
information 
to 
constant  attacks  by  hackers.  Parallel  to  this 
technological growth, we also identify a significant 
evolution  of  so-called  cyber-attacks,  procedures 
that  aim  to  compromise  information  security  and 
computational systems [2].

In this case, the neural networks of the neural nets

to  generate  rules  based  on  the  results  obtained 
through  tests,  using  nebulous  logic  neurons.  To 
avoid over fitting and assisting in the definition of 
the  network  topology,  training  models  based  on 
the  extreme  learning  machine  and  regularization

neurons in the cybernetic invasion problem. 

The use of fuzzy neural networks has been used 
in several branches, such as economics [4], for the 
recognition  of  human  faces  in  the  3D  form  [5], 
selection of characteristics [6], rainfall forecasting 
[7]. This intelligent technique is already used in the 
field  of  information  security  as  a  methodology  to 
detect attacks in network traffic [8] and recognition

The article is organized as follows: In section II we 
have  the  technical  reference,  with  a  definition  of 
essential concepts involved in the development of 
the work. At 

section  III  are  presented  the  description  of  the 
process  of  using  the  hybrid  artificial  intelligence 
model  for  identification  and  system  specialists  in 
cyber-attacks,  with  details  of  specific  procedures 
and  concepts  used.  Finally,  in  section  IV  the 
conclusions are presented.  

2. Literature Review 

A. Cyberspace 

The term cybernetic space was first employed in a 
novel  written  by  Willian  Gibson  "Neuromancer" 
[13];  we  can  consider  it  as  the  metaphor  that 
describes  non-physical 
territory  created  by 
computational means, notably the internet, where 
individuals  and  corporations,  alone  or  in  groups, 
members  of  companies,  public  agencies  or 
conduct 
governments, 
research  and 
in  general,  using 
Information  and  Communication  Technologies 
(ICT)  as  support  for  its  operation  [11].  Actions  in 
cyberspace are classified as offensive, exploitative 
or  protective,  and  offensives  can  even  impact 
national security [12].

B. Cyber Attacks 

for  security, 

In  the  world  situation,  cyberspace  is  an  area  in 
which,  despite  having  an  understanding  of  the 
there  are  no  measures 
need 
implemented in a systematic and articulated way 
that can guarantee the reliability and preservation 
of the systems used. In an early form, nations have 
been preparing to avoid or minimize cyber-attacks 
on networks and government information systems, 
as well as all other segments of society [11]. 

The attacks can happen in a physical way, where 
the  devices  containing  the  information  are  easily 
accessible,  as  well  as  modems,  cables  and 
physical storage media [16]. By human means, the 
attack is employed by social engineering, and by 
the  logical  medium,  in  which  techniques  like  the 
invasion  to  overthrow  services  (DDoS)  are  used 
where the attacker works to overload the system 
in focus. 

Techniques that exploit the vulnerability of access 
ports, shipping mass virus and malware, or even 
decoders of passwords, the last one that consists 
of a script that tries to decipher passwords [16]. 

Another essential aspect to be considered relates 
to  cybercrime,  mainly  due  to  the  harmful  effects 
that may result from the misuse of information and 
communication  systems  by  malicious  persons. 
Despite  the  efforts  of  some  sectors of  the  Public 
Administration, there are still loopholes in Brazilian

law,  and  there  are  no  laws  for  some  types  of 
actions that are already considered crimes in other 
countries. Also, there is no clear policy grounding 
a lawsuit against another state that has somehow

deserving  some  treatment,  and  this  progress  is 
being slower than the situation requires [12].

C. SQL Injection 

Structured  Query  Language,  or  just  SQL,  is  the 
default  language  for  interacting  with  relational 
databases. In it, we can do the main tasks related 
to data manipulation in database structures [20]. 
SQL Injection is a type of cyber-attack that takes 
advantage of faults in systems that generally have 
a  database 
through  SQL 
communication 
commands,  and  for  that  reason  is  considered  a 
kind  of  attack  is  straightforward.  In  this  invasion 
process,  the  attacker  can  insert  a  custom  and 
undue SQL statement inside a query (SQL query) 
through  the  data  entries  of  a  program,  such  as 
forms  or  URL  of  an  application.  In  the  fields 
destined  for  user  information,  these  commands 
are performed, i.e., SQL commands are displayed, 
however, because of this failure in the applications 
they  end  up  causing changes  in  the  database or 
inappropriate access to the application [21]. 

A  cracker  can  get  any  stealth  data  held  in  the 
database  of  a  server  computer  through  SQL 
injection  attacks,  including  depending  on  the 
version  of  the  database,  you  can  also  enter 
malicious commands and get full permission to the 
machine where the bank is running [22]. Figure 1 
shows  essential  steps  for  an  attack  by  SQL 
Injection. 

D. Cyber Defense 

According 
to  Kshetri‘s  definitions:  "Cybernetic 
security and understood as the art of assuring the 
existence and continuity of the Information Society 
of  a  nation,  guaranteeing  and  protecting,  in  the 
Cyber Space, its information assets and its critical 
infrastructures" [14]. We can also characterize it as 
a  set  of  defensive,  exploratory  and  offensive 
actions,  in  the  context  of  planning,  carried  out  in 
cyberspace,  with  the  purpose  of  protecting  our 
information systems [12]. 

Figure  1.  SQL  Attack  overview.  Available  in: 
https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/exploiting-
sql-injection-example/ 

Keeping  data  secure  is  a  21st-century  challenge 
for  Brazil.  There  is  an  increasing  emphasis  on 
cyber security as a strategic function of the state, 
and it is essential for the maintenance of the critical 
infrastructures  of  the  country.  It  can  be  said  that 
the  country  to  develop  cannot  relinquish  the 
security  of  its  cyberspace.  According  to  the 
provisions of the National Defense Strategy (END) 
[17], the responsibility of coordinating the actions 
of Cyber Defense is entrusted to the Army within 
the Armed Forces. 

Due  to  this  responsibility,  the  Brazilian  Army  is 
creating the Center for Cyber Defense, has been 
articulating  in  this  area  and  consolidating  its 
position [12]. It is therefore observed that there is 
a  notion  of  the  importance  of  taking  actions  that 
favor  and  allow  the  establishment  of  security  in 
cyberspace,  although  the  exact  size  of  what  this 
may  represent  is  not  known,  as  well  as  the 
measures that can and do be adopted to achieve 
this goal., 

E. Artificial neural networks 

Artificial neural networks are intelligent models that 
use in their structures the logical neuron, trying to 
simulate  the  processing  of  information  of  the 
human  brain 
through  a  system  of  several 
interconnected  artificial  neurons  that  are  united 
employing  synaptic  connections.  In  a  simplified 
way, an artificial neural network can be seen as a 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
_________________________________________________________________________ Batista et. al      11 

graph where the nodes are the neurons, and the 
links function the synapses [18]. 

Artificial neural networks are differentiated by their 
architecture  and  the  way  the  weights  associated 
with  the  connections  are  adjusted  during  the 
learning process. Learning is the way in which the 
neural network captures the information provided 
by the inputs and through the relationships and the 
synaptic weights make decisions about the central 
theme  of  the  database.  The  architecture  of  a 
neural  network  restricts  the  type  of  problem  in 
which the network can be used, and is defined by 
the  number  of  layers  (single  layer  or  multiple 
layers),  number  of  nodes  in  each  layer,  type  of 
connection  between  nodes 
forward  or 
feedback) and by their way of acting [18]. Figure 2 
shows  the  structure  of  a  neural  network  with 
multiple layers. It also highlights the neurons and 
their synaptic connections.

F. Fuzzy Systems 

The  use  of  fuzzy  systems  is  necessary  in  cases 
where  the  classical  logic  approach  becomes 
unfeasible for solving a problem due to the nature 
of its complexity [19]. The best-known methods are 
subject to sudden changes to solve problems due 
to the simplification of the real model, but the fuzzy 
systems  have  resources  (pertinence  functions, 
rules,  and  aggregation  operators)  that  allow  a 
more accurate approximation to the actual model, 
avoiding that the solution generated by the fuzzy 
system  differs  considerably  from  the  real  model. 
Figure 3 presents the main elements of fuzzy logic: 
its  inputs,  the  process  of  transforming  input  data 
into  fuzzy  elements,  the  creation  of  input  fuzzy 

sets, the set of rules and inferences, the obtaining 
of fuzzy response sets, the defuzzification that is 
to  make  the  values  obtained  according  to  the 
inputs of the system and the SQL Injection Attacks 
in an expected way.

G. Fuzzy neural networks - General Concepts 

Fuzzy  neural  networks  use  the  structure  of  an 
artificial  neural  network  (ANN),  where  classics  of 
artificial neurons are replaced by fuzzy neurons [7] 
[9].  These  neurons  are 
implemented  using 
triangular  rules  that  generalize  the  operations  of 
union  and  intersection  of  classical  sets  allowing 
them  to  be  used  in  fuzzy  set  theory.  Thus,  the 
neural network is now seen as a linguistic system, 
preserving the learning capacity of RNA [8]. 

They provide a network as the topology and allow 
the use of a wide variety of learning processes with 
databases from various contexts. The main feature 
of  these  networks  is  their  transparency,  allowing 
the use of a priori  information to define the initial 
network  topology  and  allowing  the  extraction  of 
valuable  information  from  the  resulting  topology 
after training in the form of a fuzzy set of rules [10].

Fuzzy neural network models are used in diverse 
contexts  of  economics  and  science  in  recent 
years. The techniques used to create specialized 
systems act in settings such as sleep ECG signal

regression  models  have  also  studied  in  fuzzy 
neural  networks  in  [39],  and  in  [40]  the  hybrid 
model  is  used  for  software  effort  estimation. 
Therefore  it  is  notorious  the  scope  of  areas  and 
approaches that these models can act.

Attack 
Identification Methodology (Model- 
bioHAIFCS) 

The paper on network anomaly detection based on 
neural  network  evolution  written  by  Konstantinos 
Demertzis  and  Lazaros  Iliadis  [3],  describes  an 
intelligent system of machine learning, where part 
of the system works looking for known threats, and 
another  part  tries  to  detect  probable  threats 
according to abnormal activities that take place in 
the  order.  The  detection  system  is  simple,  it 
generates a state being treated as usual, and all 
the  signals  outside  the  edge  of  that  state  are 
processed  as  an  anomaly,  so  the  detection 
algorithm learns continuously while the system is 
active in the network, is more and more need. 

The  methodology  used  in  the  article  was  the 
Spiking  Artificial  Neural  Networks  (SANN)  [3], 
which  uses  an  Evolving  Connectionist  System 
(eCOS)  and  Multi-Layer  Feed  Forward  ANN 
approach to classify the exact type of intrusion or 
network  abnormality  with  minimal  computational 
potential. SANN is a set of modular systems based 
on node connections. The system organizes itself 
continuously, in line mode, adapting itself from the 
input  data,  being  able  to  function  or  not  in  a 
supervised way. The SANN is also being applied 
to  several  other  complex  real-world  problems, 
proving  to  be  quite  capable.  The  name  of  the 
developed model  is  called  a  bio  HAIFCS  (Hybrid 
Evolving  Spiking  Anomaly  Detection  Model), 
which works on the peaks that occur in the system, 
while  the  neurons  are  used  to  monitor  the 
algorithm using One Pass learning. 

Traffic-oriented  data  is  used  by  importing  the 
classes,  which  use 
the  variable  Population 
Encoding (control variable from data conversion of 

the sample to the actual value in the time peaks). 
Data were classified into two types, Class 0, is the 
class of standard results. Class 1, corresponding 
to abnormal results. When there is verification, and 
the result is 0, the eSNN classification process is 
repeated, but with appropriate data vectors. If the 
result  continues  0,  the  process  is  terminated. 
When the result is Class 1, a neural network of two 
layers is used to recognize the pattern of the type 
of attack, using all the resources of the KDD cup 
database [40], if it happens in the hidden layer, 33 
neurons are used. The results of the process are 
presented to the network administrator as an alert, 
and 
the  HESADM  graphical  model  can  be 
analyzed in figure 4 [3]. 

Figure 4- HESADM model [3]. 

The dataset used for the tests were from the KDD 
Cup 1999 [40], created in the Lincoln Lab of MIT 
[23],  a  set  that  according  to  the  authors  of 
HESADM is the most popular used. The collection 
contains data simulating a US Air Force network. 
"The event analysis method includes a connection 
between a source IP address and a destination IP, 
during  which  a  sequence  of  TCP  packets  are 
exchanged, using a specific protocol and a strictly 
defined  operating 
time.  The  database  used 
includes a list of 13884 SQL statements that have 
been  selected  by  various  sources.  Twelve 
thousand  eight  hundred  eighty-one  of  them  are

legitimate  —  the  correlation  of  SQL  statements 
with the type of SQL injections. Finally, the n-gram 
technique was used to investigate the relationship 
of the SQL statement sequence with the syntax of 
the SQL injection commands [3]. 

In figure 5 the excellent performance and reliability 
of  the  scheme  proposed  in  [3]  are  shown.  It 
presents the results of the categorization with the 
same SQL Injection dataset and employing Cross-
Validation  with  ten  k-fold,  and  other  Machine 
Learning approaches. [3] The model reached the 
result of 99.6%. 

Figure 6- Fuzzy neural network model use in this 
paper [24]. 

The  first  layer  is  composed  of  fuzzy  neurons 
functions  are  Gaussian 
whose  activation 
membership  functions  of  the  fuzzy  sets  defined 
according to the partition of the input variables. For 
each input, variable xij are defined M fuzzy sets Am, 
m of 1,... M whose membership functions are the 
activation functions of the corresponding neurons. 
Therefore, the SQL Injection Attacks of the first are 
the degrees of pertinence associated with the input 
values, that is, aj = μA
m for j = 1, .., N and m = 1, ..., 
M, where N is the number of inputs and M is the 
number  of  fuzzy  sets  for  each  input variable  [10, 
24,  25].  For  the  neurons  of  the  first  layer,  the 
values of bias and synaptic weights are defined at 
random in the interval of [0, 1]. In this work, we will 
use the total combinations of fuzzy sets generated 
for each variable when N is less than or equal to 6 
[24]. When N has high numeric values, we perform 
the random selection of a membership function for 
each input variable, where M, in this case, will be 
twice the value of input space samples, limited to 
500 membership functions. Then we use the SQL 
Injection Attacks of the fuzzy neurons of the model 
to  define  many  candidate  neurons  (Lc)  that 
represent  a  percentage  of  L  where  Lc  <L.  By 
definition,  when  L  <200  is  used  Lc  =  100%  of  L, 
case  otherwise  the  chosen  rate  can  select  the 
candidate  neurons.  This  percentage  allows  the 
choice  of  the  most  essential  neurons  of  the  first 
layer [25].

4. Fuzzy Neural Network for SQL-
Injection Attack Detection 

The  model  for  detection  of  cyber-attacks  was 
for  classification  of  binary 
initially  proposed 
patterns.  The  model  presented  is  a  grouping  of 
concepts of the models introduced in [10], [24] and 
[25]. Figure 6 shows the architecture of the fuzzy 
neural  network  used  in  the  detection  of  SQL-
Injection attacks. 

The first two layers of the model are considered a 
fuzzy  inference  system,  capable  of  extracting 
knowledge  from  the  data  and  transforming  them 
into  fuzzy  rules.  These  rules  aid  the construction 
of automated systems for detecting SQL Injection 
attacks according to the characteristics simulated 
by  American  computers.  Differently  addressed  in 
[24] the third layer is composed of a simple neuron 
that has a function of activation the methodology 
proposed by [27], called leaky ReLU. 

 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
14    Use of fuzzy neural networks to create a Specialist System for detecting attacks by SQL Injection ______ 

The  second  layer  is  composed  of  Lc  fuzzy  logic 
neurons,  where  we  highlight 
the  unineuron 
proposed  by 
[28].  Each  neuron  performs  a 
weighted aggregation of some outlets (and not all 
of them due to the neuron selection technique) of 
the first layer along with bias and randomly defined 
weights  of  the  unineurons  [24].  Logical  neurons 
are functional units that combine logical aspects of 
processing with learning ability through the system 
of fuzzy rules. They can be seen as multivariable 
nonlinear 
unit 
hypercube, [0, 1] → [0,1]𝑛 [19]. Thus, neurons and 
and or (figure 7) add the values of fuzzy relevance 
a  =  [a1,  a2,  ...  ,  a3]  initially  combining  them 
individually with their weights w = [w1, w2, ... , w3],  
a,  w  ∈  [0,1]n  to  combine  these  results  in  the 
following way [19]:

      𝑧 = 𝑜𝑟(𝑎, 𝑤) = 𝑆𝑖=1

𝑧 = 𝑎𝑛𝑑(𝑎, 𝑤) = 𝑇𝑖=1

where T and t are t-norms (product) and S and s are 
s-norms (probabilistic sum). 

Figure 7. Schematic of neurons and and or [28] 

Uninorms are the generalization of t-norms and s-
norms  by  relaxing  the  constraints  related  to  the 
neutral elements. Instead of values 0 and 1 for t-
norm and s-norm respectively, the neutral element 
is  allowed  to  assume  values  in  the  unit  interval. 
One of the main characteristics of the uninorm is 
that it no longer has the so-called neutral element, 
now being called the entity element [28]. Through 
this identity element the uninorms extend t-norms 
and s-norms by varying the value g in the interval 
between 0 and 1 allowing the alternation between 
an  s-norm  (g  =  0)  and  t-norm  (g  =  1)  [28].  The 
uninorm used in this work is expressed as follows 

:

(3) 

The  unineuron  uses  the  concepts  of  uninorm  to 
perform  more  simplified  operations  according  to 
the functions of activation of the nebulous neurons. 
Its  formatting  allows  the  unineuron  to  use  either 
concepts of a neuron and, or a neuron or. In [28] 
explain important concepts about a unineuron. The 
processing of neurons occurs at two levels. At the 
first  level  of  L1  locations  the  input  signals  are 
combined  individually  with  the  weights.  In  the 
second,  at  global  level  L2,  a  global  aggregation 
operation  is  performed  on  the  results  of  all  first-
level combinations. Traditional logical neurons use 
t-norms  and  s-norms  to  perform  the  described 
operations. 

Given a collection of pairs Ω (ai, wi), with ai ∈ [0, 1] 
it's an entrance and wi ∈ [0, 1] the following steps 
should  be  followed  to  perform  the  weighted 
aggregation [28]: 

•  Transform  each  pair  (ai,  wi)  in  a  single 

value bi = h (ai, wi);  

•  Calculate 

the  unified  aggregation  of 
transformed values U (b1, b2, ..., bm), where 
m is the number of inputs. 

The function h is responsible for transforming the 
inputs  and  corresponding  weights  into  individual 
transformed  values  [28].  A  formulation  for  the  h 
function can be visualized: 

   ℎ(𝑤, 𝑎)   =  𝑤 ∗ 𝑎  + 𝑤 ∗ 𝑔  

(4) 

Using the weighted aggregation reported in (4) we 
can write the unineuron that can be visualized: 

𝑧 = 𝑢𝑛𝑖(𝑥, 𝑤, 𝑔) = 𝑈𝑖=1

Fuzzy rules can be extracted through the network 
topology  in  conjunction  with  unineuron  logical 
neurons.  The 
is  an  example  of 
combinations of rules: 

following 

Rule1: If xi1 is A1

1 with certainly w11... 

and/or xi2 is A1

2 with certainly w21... 

      then y1 is v1 

Rule2: If xi1 is A2

1 with certainly w12...            (6) 

and/or xi2 is A2

2 with certainly w22... 

       then y2 is v2 

Rule3: If xi1 is A3

1 with certainly w13…         

then y3 is v3 

Rule4: If xi2 is A2

2 with certainly w23… 

then y4 is v4 

After  defining  the  candidate  neurons,  the  final 
architecture of the network is determined using the 
selection  of  a  subset  of  these  neurons.  When 
performing  this  procedure,  we  are  implementing 
an optimum subset of values, which can be viewed 
as a variable selection problem, returning the most 
significant  neurons  (Ls)  based  on  a  cost  function 
[24].  Analogously,  we  can  interpret  this  selection 
as  the  choice  of  the  best  set  of  rules  capable  of 
representing 
learning 
algorithm assumes that the SQL Injection Attack of 
the  second  layer  of  the  fuzzy  neural  network 
composed of all the most significant neurons (Ls) 
can be written as 

input  space.  The

Where v = [v0, v1, v2,..., vLs] is the weight vector of 
the SQL Injection Attack layer and z (xi) = [z0,  z1 
(xi), z2 (xi) ..., zLs (xi)] is the argument vector (line) 
of the second layer to z0 = 1. In this context, z (xi) 
is  considered  such  as  the  non-linear  mapping  of 
the entry for an Ls + 1 dimensional fuzzy features, 
performed  using  the  neurons  selected.  As  the 
weights  that  bind  to  the  two  first  layers  are 

assigned random shape and the only parameters 
were  the  weights  of  the  SQL  Injection  Attack  we 
can see equation (7) as a simple linear regression 
model allowing the problem of the choice of best 
subsets of neurons that will be can be idealized as 
a model of linear regression for selection problems 
[29]. A very used to perform model selection was 
created  by  [30] and  is  known as Algorithm Least 
Angle  Regression  (LARS).  LARS  is  a  regression 
algorithm for data with that it is not able to estimate 
only the regression coefficients, but also a subset 
of regressors candidates to be included in the final 
model. To we evaluate a set of K different samples 
(xi, yi), where xi = [xi1, xi2, ..., xiN] ∈ ℝ and yi ∈ ℝ for 
i  =  1,  ...,  K,  the  cost  function  of  this  algorithm  of 
regression can be defined as: 

(8) 

Where  λ  is  a  regularization  parameter  estimated 
using  the  cross  validation.  The  first  term  of  (8) 
corresponds residual sum of squares (RSS). That 
term  decreases  as  the  error  of  training  also  fall. 
The  second  term  is  a  regularization  term  l1.  This 
expression  is  used  because  it  improves  the 
generalization  of  the  network  avoiding  the  over-
adjustment [31] and can generate sparse models 
[32].  Rewriting  equation  (8)  we  understand  why 
LARS be used as a feature selection algorithm is: 

(9) 

Where β is an upper bound on the l1-norm of the 
weights, a small value of β corresponds to a large 
amount of λ and vice versa. This equation is also 
known  as  lasso  [33].  When  we  use  the  lasso 
regression  (also  called  l1-norm)  to  normalize 
models,  we  find  that  the  method  leads  to  results 
with  spatial  solutions,  generating  result  vectors 
with  many  zeros,  which  represent  data  of  no 
importance 
the  analyzed  variables.  Best 
selection of models [34]. The LARS algorithm can 
be used to perform the model selection, since, for 
a given value of λ, only a fraction (or none) of the 
regressors have equal weights other than zero. If 
λ  =  0, 
the  problem  becomes  unrestricted 
regression,  and  all  weights  are  nonzero.  As  λmax

increases from 0 to a given value λmax, the number 
of nonzero weights decreases from N to 0. For the 
problem considered in this work, the regressors zls 
are  the  SQL  Injection  Attacks  of  the  significant 
neurons. Thus, the LARS algorithm can be used to 
select an optimal subset of the vital neurons that 
minimize  (9)  for  a  given  value  of  λ,  obtained 
through  cross-validation.  Using  the  concept  of 
bootstrap and performing the intersection between 
supports, Bach [34] developed a model adjustment 
estimator, without the conditions of consistencies 
required  by  the  lasso  method.  To  this  new 
the  name  of  Bolasso 
procedure,  he  gave 
(bootstrap-enhanced 
least  absolute  shrinkage 
operator). This framework can be seen as a voting 
scheme applied to support of the lasso method. At 
the  However,  Bolasso  can  be  seen  as  a 
consensus-building regime where it is maintained 
the most  significant  subset  of variables  on  which 
all  regressors  agree  when  the  aspect  is  the 
selection  of  variables  [34].  The  regressors  to  be 
included in the final model are defined according 
to  the  frequency  with  which  each  of  them  is 
selected  through  different  tests.  A  consensus 
threshold  is  determined,  say  ρ  =  50%,  and  a 
regressor is included if chosen in at least 50% of 
the trials. In this article, the lasso bootstrap is used 
to define the network topology and select the most 
significant neurons. The extreme learning machine 
concepts [26] are applied to calculate the weights 
of  the  SQL  Injection  Attack  layer  and  the  neural 
aggregation network, present in the third  layer of 
the  model,  performs  the  classification  of  cyber-
attack patterns according to equation (10): 

          (10) 

Where z0 = 1, v0 is the bias, and zj and vj, j = 1, ..., 
ls  are  the  SQL  Injection  Attack  of  each  fuzzy 
their 
neuron  of 
corresponding  weight,  respectively.  The  leaky 
ReLU function is expressed by [27]: 

the  second 

layer  and 

        (11) 

This  function  of  activation  is  now  employed  in 
problems  of  diverse  natures,  especially  those 
where it demands a higher sensitivity in the results 
obtained by the fuzzy neural networks. 

Finally, after the definition of the network topology, 
we  calculate  the  vector  of  weights  of  the  SQL 
Injection  Attack  layer  v  =  [v0,  v1,  v2,  vLs]T.  In  this 
paper v is calculated using the pseudo Inverse of 
Moore-Penrose: 

 (12) 

where Z + is pseudo-inverse of Moore-Penrose of 
Z which is the minimum norm of the solution of the 
least squares for the weights of the exit. Z can be 
defined as: 

                      (13) 

The  learning  process  can  be  summarized  as 
shown below. It has four parameters: 

•  The  number  of  fuzzy  sets  that  will  partition  the 
input space, M. 

• The percentage of candidate neurons, Lc. 

• The number of bootstrap replications, b. 

• The consensus threshold, ρ. 

5. SQL Injection Detection Tests 

To perform the SQL Injection detection tests and 
to  enable  the  construction  of  an  expert  system 
based  on  the  nature  of  the  data,  the  KDD  Cup 
1999  database  was  used  [40],  which  includes 
13.869 cases of which 12.881 are malicious, and 
988  are  legitimate  (0.0723%)  of  SQL  Injection 
attacks.  Unbalanced  data  sets  are  a  particular

case  for  classification  problems  where  class 
distribution is not uniform across classes. Usually, 
they are composed of two categories: the majority 
(negative) and the minority (positive). From these 
characteristics,  the  parameters  length,  entropy, 
level of malice, confidence level, confidence, and 
Class were used. The expert system is based on 
the  IF/THEN.  The  fuzzy  neural  network  models 
fuzzy  neural  network 
(UNI-RNN 
composed of unineurons (4), and AND-RNN [10] 
is  composed  of  andneurons  (2).  They  were 
compared  with  other  classifier  algorithms  for  the 
database:  SVM  (Support  Vector  Machine)  [41],

Bayes) [43] and C4.5 [44].

[24] 

The  test conditions  were  similar  to  proceeding  in 
work done in [3], where the configurations and the 
use of the weka tool [45] were the same. 

It should be noted that to avoid trends in the tests 
performed, all available samples were exchanged 
and 30 measurements of accuracy were collected 
from each  of  the  bases evaluated  in  each model 
analyzed.  The  variables  involved  in  the  process 
were  normalized  with  mean  zero  and  variance 
one. All SQL Injection Attacks of the model were 
normalized to the interval [-1, 1]. 

For  the  fuzzy  neural  network  model  the  optimal 
parameters M, b and ρ were found through cross-
validation (70% training, 30% for test) using 10-k-
fold. The ranges were as follows: M = {2, 3, 4}, b = 
{8, 16, 32}, ρ = {50%, 60%, 70%}. The value of Lc 
was arbitrated at 200 as in [24]. 

The results (Table 1) were provided with the tests 
performed  on  a  desktop machine  with  Intel  Core 
i5-3470 3.20GHz processor and 4.00 GB Memory.

A. Interpretability of the resulting model 

The system presented useful results on the use of 
fuzzy rules for the construction of systems. We can 
highlight  the  example  obtained  when  using  two 
membership functions allowing the parameters are 
classified as "low” and “high." Figure 8 shows the 
generated  fuzzy  inference  system  and  Figure  9

6. Conclusions 

After  the  tests  were  performed  using  the  fuzzy 
neural network model, we conclude that the results 
of  the  experiments  prove  that  the  creation  of  a 
specialized system helps to prevent cyber-attacks 
by  encouraging  the  construction  of  intelligent 
applications. 
Through  the  obtained  results,  it  can  be  affirmed 
that the tests performed were satisfactory. Based 
on the results obtained by Demertzis [3], the model 
presented  here  is  statistically  equivalent  to  the 
HESADM model [3], reaching close to state of the
