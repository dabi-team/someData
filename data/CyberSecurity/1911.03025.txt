Secure State Estimation and
Attack Reconstruction in Cyber-
Physical Systems: Sliding Mode
Observer Approach

Shamila Nateghi, Yuri Shtessel, Christopher Edwards
and Jean-Pierre Barbot

Abstract

A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a tight coupling of computational resources,

network communication, and physical processes. They are composed of a set of
networked components, including sensors, actuators, control processing units, and
communication agents that instrument the physical world to make “smarter.”
However, cyber components are also the source of new, unprecedented vulnerabil-
ities to malicious attacks. In order to protect a CPS from attacks, three security
levels of protection, detection, and identification are considered. In this chapter, we
will discuss the identification level, i.e., secure state estimation and attack recon-
struction of CPS with corrupted states and measurements. Considering different
attack plans that may assault the states, sensors, or both of them, different online
attack reconstruction approaches are discussed. Fixed-gain and adaptive-gain
finite-time convergent observation algorithms, specifically sliding mode observers,
are applied to online reconstruction of sensor and state attacks. Next, the corrupted
measurements and states are to be cleaned up online in order to stop the attack
propagation to the CPS via the control signal. The proposed methodologies are
applied to an electric power network, whose states and sensors are under attack.
Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed observers.

Keywords: cyber-physical systems, sensor attack, state attack, sliding mode
observers

1. Introduction

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are the integration of the cyber-world of com-
puting and communications with the physical world. In many systems, control of a
physical plant is integrated with a wireless communication network, for example,
transportation networks, electric power networks, integrated biological systems,
industrial automation systems, and economic systems [1, 2]. Since CPSs use open
computation and communication platform architectures, they are vulnerable to
suffering adversarial physical faults or cyber-attacks. Faults and cyber-attacks are
referred to as attacks throughout this chapter.

Control Theory in Engineering

Recent real-world cyber-attacks, including multiple power blackouts in Brazil
[3], and the Stuxnet attack [4] in 2010, showed the importance of providing secu-
rity to CPSs. Identification and modeling process as [5, 6] which are based on data
can be seriously affected by corrupted data. As a result, information security tech-
niques [7] may be not sufficient for protecting systems from sophisticated cyber-
attacks. It is suggested in [8] that information security mechanisms have to be
complemented by specially designed resilient control systems. Controlling CPS with
sensors and actuators, who are hijacked/corrupted remotely or physically by the
attackers, is a challenge. The use of novel control/observation algorithms is pro-
posed in this chapter for recovering CPS performance online if an attacker pene-
trates the information security mechanisms.

Cyber security of CPS must provide three main security goals: availability,
confidentiality, and integrity [7]. This means that the CPS is to be accessible and
usable upon demand, the information has to be kept secret from unauthorized
users, and the trustworthiness of data has to be guaranteed. Lack of availability,
confidentiality, and integrity yields denial of service, disclosure, and deception,
respectively. A specific kind of deception attack called a replay attack has been
investigated when the system model is unknown to the attackers but they have
access to the all sensors [9, 10]. Replay attacks are carried out by “hijacking” the
sensors, recording the readings for a certain time, and repeating such readings while
injecting them together with an exogenous signal into the system’s sensors. It is
shown that these attacks can be detected by injecting a random signal, unknown to
the attacker, into the system. In the case when the system’s dynamic model is
known to the attacker, another kind of deception attack, called a cover attack, has
been studied in [11], and the proposed algorithm allows cancelling out the effect of
this attack on the system dynamics. In systems with unstable modes, false data
injection attacks are applied to make some unstable modes unobservable [12].
Denial of service attacks assaults data availability through blocking information
flows between different components of the CPS. The attacker can jam the commu-
nication channels, modify devices, and prevent them from sending data, violate the
routing protocols, etc. [13]. In a stealth attack, the attacker modifies some sensor
readings by physically tampering with the individual meters or by getting access to
some communication channels [14, 15]. As a result, detecting and isolating of cyber-
attacks in CPSs has received immense attention [16]. However, how to ensure the
CPS can continue functioning properly if a cyber-attack has happened is another
serious problem that should be investigated; therefore, the focus of this chapter is
on resilient control of CPS.

In [17], new adaptive control architectures that can foil malicious sensor and
actuator attacks are developed without reconstructing the attacks, by means of
feedback control only. A sparse recovery algorithm is applied to reconstruct online
the cyber-attacks in [18]. Sliding mode control with advantages of quick response
and strong robustness is one of the best approaches to control CPS [19–22]. In [23],
a finite-time convergent higher-order sliding mode (HOSM) observer, based on a
HOSM differentiator and a sparse recovery algorithm, are used to reconstruct
online the cyber-attack in a nonlinear system. Detection and observation of a scalar
attack by a sliding mode observer (SMO) has been accomplished for a linearized
differential-algebraic model of an electric power network when plant and sensor
attacks do not occur simultaneously [24]. Cyber-attacks against phasor measure-
ment unit (PMU) networks are considered in [25], where a risk mitigation tech-
nique determines whether a certain PMU should be kept connected to network
or removed. In [26] a sliding mode-based observation algorithm is used to

2

reconstruct the attacks asymptotically. This reconstruction is approximate only,
since pseudo-inverse techniques are used.

In this chapter, CPSs controlled by a control input subject to sensor attacks and

state/plant attacks are considered. The corrupted measurements propagate the
attack signals to the CPS through the control signals causing CPS performance
degradation. The main challenge that is addressed in the chapter is online exact
reconstruction of the sensor and state attacks with an application to an electric
power network. The contribution of this chapter is:

• Novel fixed and adaptive-gain SMO for the linearized/linear CPS under attack
are proposed for the online reconstruction of sensor attacks. The time-varying
attacks are reconstructed via the proposed SMO that includes a newly designed
dynamic filter. Note that the well-known SMO proposed in [27] reconstructs
the slow-varying perturbations only.

• A super twisting SMO is applied to reconstruct the state/plant time-varying

attacks of the linearized/linear CPS under attack.

• For online state/plant attack reconstruction in nonlinear CPS under attack, a

higher-order sliding mode disturbance observer [28] is used.

• An algorithm that use sliding mode differentiation techniques [29] in concert
with the finite-time convergent observer for the sparse signal recovery is
applied to online reconstruction of time-varying attack in nonlinear CPS under
attack when we have limited measurements and more possible sources of
attack [30].

2. Motivation example: electric power network under attack

In a real-world power network, only a small group of generator rotor angles and

rates is directly measured, and typical attacks aim at injecting disturbance signals
that mainly affect the sensorless generators [24].

The small-signal version of the classic structure-preserving power network

model is adopted to describe the dynamics of a power network. Consider a

and n2 load buses

weighted by their susceptance values. The Laplacian associated

gi and the buses bi. The edges of G are the transmission lines bi; bj

The system (1) was simulated with and without above attacks. Based on
the simulation results shown in Figures 2 and 3, the stealth attack in (4) yields
inappropriate degradation of the power network performance.

This motivates why online reconstruction of the attacks followed by cleanup
of the measurements prior to using them in control signal is of prime importance for
retaining the performance of the power network (as it will be shown in Section VI
where the proposed SMO is applied to achieve this goal). The case study of the
power network (1) will be further discussed in details in Section 6.

3. Cyber-physical system dynamics

Consider the following completely observable and asymptotically stable system

_x ¼ f xð Þ þ B xð Þd tð Þ
y ¼ C xð Þ þ Dd tð Þ

(5)

where x ∈ Rn is the state vector, f xð Þ ∈ Rn is a smooth vector field, d tð Þ ∈ Rm
denotes the attack/fault vector which is additive and matched to the control signal,
y ∈ Rp is the measurement vector, p ≥ m, C xð Þ ∈ Rp is the output smooth vector

field, B xð Þ ∈ Rn(cid:2)m and D ∈ Rp(cid:2)m denote the attack/fault distribution matrices. For
notational convenience, and without affecting generality, the input distribution
matrices can be partitioned as

where B1 xð Þ ∈ Rn(cid:2)m1 , D1 ∈ Rp(cid:2) m(cid:3)m1

ð

Þ, 01 ∈ Rn(cid:2) m(cid:3)m1

ð

Þ, 02 ∈ Rp(cid:2)m1 where

m1 ≤ m.

Assumption (A1): B1 xð Þ, D1 are of full rank.
The attack/fault vector is partitioned accordingly as

d ¼

dx
dy(cid:7)

(cid:8)

where dx ∈ Rm1 and dy ∈ Rm(cid:3)m1

Therefore, Eq. (5) can be rewritten as

_x ¼ f xð Þ þ B1 xð Þdx tð Þ
y ¼ C xð Þ þ D1dy tð Þ

(7)

(8)

where dx tð Þ, dy tð Þ represent the state and the sensor attack vectors, respectively.

Different attack strategies are shown in Table 1 and discussed in Section 1.

Since p ≥ m (cid:3) m1, the system (8) can be partitioned using a nonsingular trans-

4. Problem formulation

Assumption (A2): Attacks are detectable, i.e., the invariant zeros of Eq. (11) are

stable.

The problem is to protect the closed loop system (11) from the sensor attack
dy ∈ Rm(cid:3)m1 and state/plant attack dx tð Þ ∈ Rm1 by means of designing fixed-gain and
adaptive-gain SMOs that allow: (a) reconstructing online the sensor attack dy, the
state/plant attack dx tð Þ, and the plant states x so that

^
dx tð Þ ! dx tð Þ,

^
dy tð Þ ! dy tð Þ, ^x ! x

(12)

as time increases and.
(b) “cleanup” of the plant and sensors so that the dynamics of the CPS under

attack (11) approaches,

Note that Eq. (13) represents the compensated CPS that converges to CPS

without attack as time increases.

5. Results: secure state estimation

In this chapter, for the linearized case of the system in Eq. (5), two SMOs for
state estimation and attack reconstruction are discussed. Two other SMO strategies
for nonlinear system (5) are also proposed and investigated.

5.1 Attack reconstruction in linear system via filtering by adaptive sliding mode

Proof of the Theorem 1 is omitted for brevity.
Remark 1: The SMO (31) is a dynamic filter that allows reconstructing

the time-varying attack d tð Þ. This filter is the main novel feature of the proposed
observer.

5.1.3 Adaptive-gain attack observer design

In Eq. (29), it was assumed that the perturbation term φ is locally norm-
bounded and ρ . 0 in Eq. (25) is known. In many practical cases, the boundary of
attacks is unknown, and the gain of the sliding mode injection term Eq. (25) in the
fixed-gain observer in Eq. (23) can be overestimated. The gain overestimation could
increase chattering that is difficult to attenuate.

The constant gain ρ . 0 can be replaced by an adaptive-gain ρ tð Þ by applying the

dual layer nested adaptive sliding mode observation algorithm [32], i.e.,

υ ¼ (cid:3) ρ tð Þ þ η

adaptive law [32]:

5.4 Attack reconstruction in nonlinear system by sparse recovery algorithm

(cid:12)

(cid:13)

In some applications, there are a limited number of measurements, p, and more

sources of attack, m. Previously, we investigated the cases where p . m. Now,
consider system (5) with more attacks than measurements, m . p.

Notice that a more general format of (5) is considered here where matrix D is a

function of x as well.

Assumption (A11): Assume that the attack vector d tð Þ is sparse, meaning that
numerous attacks are possible, but the attacks are not coordinated, and only few
nonzero attacks happen at the same time.

5.4.1 Sparse recovering algorithm

The problem of recovering an unknown input signal from measurements is well

known, as a left invertibility problem, as seen in several works [30, 37], but this
problem was only treated in the case where the number of measurements is equal or
greater than the number of unknown inputs. The left invertibility problem in the
case of fewer measurements than unknown inputs has no solution or more exactly
has an infinity of solutions.

In particular, the objective of exact recovery under sparse assumptions denoted
for the sake of simplicity as “sparse recovery” (SR) is to find a concise representa-
tion of a signal using a few atoms from some specified (over-complete) dictionary,

ξ ¼ Φs þ ε0

(74)

16

Secure State Estimation and Attack Reconstruction in Cyber-Physical Systems: Sliding Mode…
DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.88669

where s ∈ RN are the unknown inputs with no more than j nonzero entries,
ξ ∈ RM are the measurements, ε0 is a measurement noise, and Φ ∈ RM(cid:2)N is the
dictionary where M ≪ N.

Definition 1: The Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) condition of j-order with

constant ςj ∈ 0; 1
matrix Φ yields

ð

(75)

for any j sparse of signal s. Considering ΦΓ as the index set of nonzero elements

of s, then Eq. (75) is equivalent to [23]:

1 (cid:3) ςs ≤ eig ΦT

Γ ΦΓ

≤ 1 þ ςs

(76)

where ΦΓ is the sub-matrix of Φ with active nodes.
The problem of SR is often cast as an optimization problem that minimizes a cost

In Eq. (77) the original sparsity term is the quasi norm sj j0; but as long as the RIP

conditions hold, it can be replaced by Θ sð Þ ¼ sk k1≜
is the balancing parameter and s ∗ is the critical point, i.e., the solution of Eq. (74).
Typically, for sparse vectors s with j-sparsity, where j must be equal or smaller than
M(cid:3)1
[37], the solution to the SR problem is unique and coincides with the critical
2
point of Eq. (74) providing that RIP condition for Φ with order 2j is verified. In
other words, in order to guarantee the existence of a unique solution to the optimi-
zation problem Eq. (74), Φ should satisfy restricted isometry property [37].

Under the sparse assumption of s and the fulfillment of the j-RIP condition of the

matrix Φ, the estimation algorithm proposed in [37] is

(78)

where v ∈ RN is the state vector,

(cid:13)
of (74), and μ . 0 is a time-constant determined by the physical properties of the
implementing system.
soft thresholding function:

:d cβ ¼ :j jβsign :ð Þ and a tð Þ ¼ Hλ vð Þ where Hλ :ð Þ is a continuous

^s tð Þ represents the estimate of the sparse signal s

(cid:17)

Hλ vð Þ ¼ max vj j (cid:3) λ; 0

ð

Þ sgn vð Þ

(79)

where λ . 0 is chosen with respect to the noise and the minimum absolute value

of the nonzero terms.

Under Definition 1, the state v of Eq. (78) converges in finite time to its equilib-

rium point v ∗ , and

^s tð Þ in Eq.(78) converges in finite time to ^s ∗ of Eq. (77).

5.4.2 Attack reconstruction

Control Theory in Engineering

Deception attacks dx1, dx2, and dx3 are reconstructed very accurately as shown in

Figures 4–6. The only nonzero sensor attack is detected and accurately estimated
by using the SR algorithm as shown in Figure 7. In Figure 8a and 8b, the corrupted
system outputs (which are system states in our case) are compared to the “cleaned”
outputs that are computed by subtracting the estimated attacks from the corrupted
sensors and actuators and to the system outputs when the system is not under
attack.

7. Conclusion

The critical infrastructures like power grid, water resources, etc. are large
interconnected cyber-physical systems whose reliable operation depends critically
on their cyber substructure. In this chapter, cyber-physical systems when their
sensors and/or states are under attack or experiencing faults are investigated. The
sensor and states/plant attacks are reconstructed online by using a fixed-gain and
adaptive-gain sliding mode observers. As soon as the attacks are reconstructed,
corrupted measurements and states are cleaned from attacks, and the control signal
that uses cleaned measurements provides cyber-physical system performance close
to the one without attack. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by
simulation results of a real electrical power network with sensors under stealth
attack and states under deception attacks.
