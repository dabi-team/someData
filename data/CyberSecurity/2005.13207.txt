Abstract—  With  improvement  in  smart  grids  through  two-way 
communication,  demand  response  (DR)  has  gained  significant 
attention due to the inherent flexibility provided by shifting non-
critical  loads  from  peak  periods  to  off-peak  periods,  which  can 
greatly  improve  grid  reliability  and  reduce  cost  of  energy. 
Operators  utilize  DR  to  enhance  operational  flexibility  and 
alleviate  network  congestion.  However,  the  intelligent  two-way 
communication is susceptible to cyber-attacks. This paper studies 
the  benefits  of  DR  in  security-constrained  economic  dispatch 
(SCED) and then the vulnerability of the system to line overloads 
when cyber-attack targets DR signals. This paper proposes a false 
demand response signal and load measurement injection (FSMI) 
cyber-attack model that sends erroneous DR signals while hacking 
measurements to make the attack undetectable. Simulation results 
on the IEEE 24-bus system (i) demonstrate the cost-saving benefits 
of demand response, and (ii) show significant line overloads when 
the demand response signals are altered under an FSMI attack.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

T 

he  advancement  in  smart  grid  technologies  has  brought 
two-way communications along with sensing and control 
signals.  This requires an intelligent  energy  management 
system (EMS) and an enhanced cyber-layer to efficiently and 
securely  operate.  These  technologies  enable  system  operators 
to  determine  and  send  signals  to  redispatch  generators  and 
enable demand response for controllable loads. However, this 
increases the vulnerability of the system to cyber-attacks. The

operation (b) under the proposed FSMI attack. 

Here, SCADA consolidates all the  measurements, and then 
the state estimation along with the bad data detection can work 
iteratively  to  estimate  the  true  system  state  variables.  The 
RTCA process is a sequence of power flow runs using the state 
estimation  solution  to  identify  critical  contingencies  in  the 
system.  The  SCED  determines  the  physical  signals  for  least-
cost generator dispatch solution to meet the forecasted demand, 
the  information  from  RTCA  is  used  in  SCED  to  ensure 
reliability and security of the system [2]. 

The  SCED  is  not  only  used  to  determine  the  least-cost 
generator  dispatch  solution  but  also  obtain  demand  response 
(DR) signals. This problem is solved in real-time and short-term 
operations in both regulated and deregulated environments. DR 
through controllable loads benefits the system by moving non-
critical  deferrable  loads  from  peak  hours  to  non-peak  hours 
which  increases  the  system  flexibility  [3].  Therefore,  the 
operators require DR participating loads to be dispatchable in 
the  SCED.  The  loads  participating  in  DR  programs  are 
compensated 
through  capacity  markets  and/or  real-time 
markets [4]-[9].  

Before 

implemented, 

the  automated  DR  was 

load 
controllability  was  implemented  through  manual  intervention 
which had lower chances of cyber-attacks. However, with the 
increasing  use  of  standard  products,  operating  systems  and 
distributed  networking  devices  add  intelligence  and  two-way 
communication capabilities to the smart grid [10], which results 
in automated demand response. This eventually means another 
access for cyber vulnerability attacks to the system.  

There  is  an  extensive  interest  in  the  vulnerability  of  power 
systems  and  cyber-attacks  on  various  elements  of  the  system 

such as attacks on system state estimation [11], system topology 
[12],  generator  dynamics  [13],  and  energy  markets  [14].  A 
popular  cyber-attack  targets  overloading  the  system,  i.e. 
overloading  one  or  multiple  lines,  which  may  cause  large 
system  disturbances  and  lead  to  cascade  events  [15]-[16].  In 
Fig.  1  (b),  it  is  perceived  that  sending  erroneous  DR  signals 
along with coordinated false measurements can be undetectable 
to the system operator.  

In markets that offer DR services, consumers have the option 
to register for DR programs that are run by utilities. The utility 
offers  incentives  to  consumers  to  either  lower  or  shift  their 
electric demand to improve power system balancing and reduce 
the overall system cost. Utilities use a client device referred to 
as a DR client to communicate with the utility DR server [17].  
Such  technologies  resulted  in  an  increase  in  DR  programs 
participation in energy markets to 29,674 MW in 2018, 7.7% 
higher than 2017 [18]. When the loads are required to shift, the 
DR server will send commands to the DR clients, then the DR 
clients either defer or drop the loads following the DR signal 
from the server.  

Such  timely  communication  requires  the  availability  of  the 
communication channels and server systems especially for fast-
DR to control the electricity demand within a very short period. 
Not  only  that,  the  integrity  of  data  requires  the  curtailment 
signal  should  only  be  sent  by  operator  and  only  participating 
customers  receive  DR  signals.  The  availability  of 
the 
communication  network  and  the  integrity  of  DR  data  are 
essential  for  information  security.  Without  these  standard 
information securities, signals can be maliciously manipulated 
to pose significant impact to the system. Therefore, with such 
vulnerabilities,  the  automated  DR  system  that  brings  great 
performance  benefit  to  the  grid  can  also  pose  great  risks  and 
challenges  in  protecting  the  smart  grids  from  cyber  security 
threats  [19].  [20]  investigated  an  automated  DR  process  and 
proposed  a  security-enhancement  mechanism  to  enhance  the 
signal  verification.  A  novel  dynamic  load  altering  attack  that 
changes a group of unsecured loads is proposed in [21], which 
can  cause  physical  damage  to  grid.  A  real-time  anomaly 
detection  algorithm  that  utilizes  load  forecasts,  generation 
schedules and synchrophasor data can detect false data injection 
attack  [22].  The  vulnerabilities  of  standard  load  forecasting 
algorithms are examined in [23]. Though [21]–[23] investigated 
power  grid  cyber-security,  vulnerability  associated  with  DR 
signals has not been considered. Also, [20] solely focused on 
load altering attack which damages the grid by destabilizing the 
frequency away from its nominal range. But the studies on the 
impact of malicious cyber-attack targeted on transmission line 
power flow against DR signals were never conducted. 

To bridge the gap presented above, this paper first studies the 
benefits of incorporating DR in SCED. The DR considered in 
this work incentivizes participating customers to shift demand 
from peak to non-peak hours. Following this, a false demand 
response signal and load measurement injection (FSMI) cyber-
attack model is proposed in this paper which affects the EMS 
operation  as  shown  in  Fig.  1  (b).  The  proposed  FSMI  attack 
aims  to  lead  to  physical  line  overloads  by  manipulating  DR 
signals  and  load  measurements,  which  illustrates  the  cyber-
vulnerability of demand response that is being widely adopted 
in  real-time  secure  operations.  The  rest  of  this  paper  is 
organized as follows. Section II depicts the SCED and SCED-

 
 
 
 
 
DR formulation and Section III describes the proposed FSMI 
attack  model.  The  test  system  with  various  load  profiles  is 
described  in  Section  IV.  Section  V  presents  the  simulation 
results  and  discusses  the  benefits  and  cyber-vulnerability  of 
demand  response  in  real-time  operations  of  electric  power 
systems. Finally, Section VI draws the conclusions.  

II.  SCED AND SCED-DR FORMULATION  

The  goal  of  SCED/SCED-DR  is  the  least-cost  dispatch  of 
committed  generators  for  a  short-term  forecasted  demand;  in 
this  work  the  look-ahead  horizon  is  1  hour  with  15-minute 
moving  intervals.  SCED/SCED-DR  models  are  based  on  the 
simplified  DC  power  flow  model  and  they  are  subject  to 
security  constraints  of 
transmission 
networks.  The  SCED/SCED-DR  considered  in  this  paper  is 
based  on  a  moving  window  method;  in  other  words,  it  looks 
ahead multiple intervals while only the solution associated with 
the first interval would be implemented. 

the  generators  and 

The objective function for SCED-DR minimizes the cost of 
operations  along  with  the  penalties  associated  with  shifting 
non-critical demand as a DR action for 15-minute, 30-minute 
and  45-minute,  as  shown  in  (1).  In  the  case  of  SCED,  the 
penalty cost associated with demand shifting is disregarded as 
DR is not implemented.

III.  FSMI ATTACK MODELS      

     DR typically requires timely communication to control the 
electricity  demand  within  a  very  short  response  time.  In  the 

proposed FSMI model, it is assumed that the attacker has the 
knowledge  of  the  system  topology  and  parameters  and  has 
access  to  all  load  measurements.  It  is  also  assumed  that  the 
attacker has control of the real-time communication channels to 
intercept and modify the DR signals sent by operator as shown 
in Fig. 1 (b). 
   The  solution  only  to  the  first  interval  of  SCED-DR  is 
implemented  per  Section  II;  and  the  proposed  FSMI  model 
targets  at  the  first  interval  or  current  operating  interval.  The

from SCED-DR are represented as

The false DR signals, 
, are modeled to overload a target 
line. Note that shortly after the proposed attack and when users 
follow the false DR signals, some false load measurements are 
required  to  cover  such  an  FSMI  attack.  The  proposed  FSMI 
attack  model  can  be  formulated  as  an  optimization  problem 
which  focuses  on  the  first  period  of  the  SCED-DR  model 
described in Section II. Its objective function (9) is to maximize 
the  physical  line  flow  of  a  chosen  target  line  l  in  the  attack 
region for the first SCED interval.

The  cyber  attacked  line  power  flows  are  obtained  through 
(10) using the DC model and the cyber nodal power balance is 
enforced using (11). The total load that is expected to be shifted 
by SCED-DR without FSMI attack is calculated in (12). Here, 
the  amount  of  demand  deferred  from  the  first  period  to  the 
,  are  the  fixed 
subsequent  3  periods, 
values  obtained  from  SCED-DR.  The  relationship  between 
physical  bus  angles  and  cyber  bus  angles  is  shown  in  (13). 
, 
Equation (14) defines the demand response deviation, 
as  the  difference  between  scheduled  demand  response  and 
∆𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷� 𝑚𝑚,1
attacked  demand  response.  Constraints  (15)-(17)  limits  the 
attack  region  to  avoid  large  DR  signal  changes  that  can 
intimidate  the  operators  with  practical  considerations:  (i)  the 
attacker can only alter DR signals for loads that are supposed to 
receive the actual  DR  signals, and (ii) DR signal deviation is 
limited to a tolerance set by the attacker. The summations of the 
absolute  change  in  state  variables  and  DR  deviations  are 
restricted by (18) and (19) respectively. The l1-norm constraints 
(18) and (19) can be converted into equivalent linear constraints 
[15] which are represented in (20)-(25).

A  limited-channel  FSMI  attack  model  can  then  be  formed 
≤ 𝑄𝑄0 , ∀𝑛𝑛𝑔𝑔𝑁𝑁
using  (9)-(19)  and  (20)-(25).  However,  the  attacker  can 
magnify the severity of the attack by sending erroneous signals 
to controllable loads that did not receive any DR signal  from 
the operator in the pre-attack state. This type of attack is known 
as  an  unlimited-channel  FSMI  attack  model  which 
is 
represented  by  (9)-(16)  and  (20)-(26).  Here,  (26)  relaxes  the 
constraints  on  the  number  of  attacked  DR  channels  and  the 
amount of nodal DR deviation that are restricted in (17).

V.  RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 

The mathematical model was implemented using AMPL and 
solved using Gurobi with a MIPGAP of 0.001. The computer 
with Intel® Xeon(R) W-2195 CPU @ 2.30GHz, and 128 GB of 
RAM was utilized.  

A.  Benefits of DR: 

From  Fig.  4,  SCED-DR  provides  a  lower  cost  solution 
compared to SCED for medium and high varying demand. At 
high demand variation, implementation of DR results in a total 
of  376  MW  shifted  by  15-minute,  140  MW  shifted  by  30-
minute  and  99  MW  shifted  by  45-minute  which  provides  a 
savings of $2,986. For medium demand, the savings are about 
$1,100  and  DR  actions  are  lower  compared  to  high  demand 
scenario. For low demand scenario, the system is operating well 
below its capacity and as a result, both SCED and SCED-DR 
provides the same solution. Here, DR actions are not activated 
since none of the lines in the system are congested.

The implementation of DR also flattens load profile as shown 
in Fig. 5. This directly correlates as an increase in system short-
term load factor utilization (LF). In this paper, the short-term 
LF is defined as the ratio of the average load to the peak load 
during the entire time period. This is represented in (27). The

required in SCED-DR.  As DR actions takes place, it leads to

B. FSMI Cyber-Attack: 

The line loading rate is defined as the ratio of line power flow 
to  line  thermal  rating;  the  pre-attack  line  loading  rates  of  all 
lines for the  high demand  scenario are obtained from SCED-
DR  and  are  represented  in  Fig.  6.  The  limited-channel  FSMI 
attack  model  limits the attacker to focus on the channels that 
receive  DR  signals  from  operators.  Therefore,  to  damage  the 
system, the attacker should first select a targeted line to operate 
his attack. From Fig. 6 that shows the initial system condition, 
the plausible target lines are line 10, line 28 and line 23 which 
have the highest loading rates in the system. It can be noted that 
line 10 and line 28 have a loading rate less than 100%, which 
implies that these lines are uncongested in the pre-attack state; 
whereas, line 23 with a loading rate of 100% implies that the 
line is congested or carrying  a flow at its capacity. For line 10, 
the  power  flow  during  pre-attack  is  139.6  MW  while  the 
thermal rating of line 10 is 157.5 MW. For line 28, the power 
flow before attack is 400.7 MW and its thermal rating is 450 
MW. For line 23, the power flow before attack is at its thermal 
rating limit, 315 MW.  

Fig. 6. Pre-attack line loading rate of all system lines. 

To  study  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  limited-channel 
FSMI  cyber-attack,  we  highlight  results  for  three  targeted 
instances: (i) line 10 as targeted line, (ii) line 28 as targeted line 
and  (iii)  line  23  as  targeted  line.  Sensitivity  analysis  is 
conducted  to  examine  how  the  parameter 
 affects  the 
performance of the proposed limited-channel FSMI attack. This 
 from 10% to 100% which directly changes 
is done by varying

the  limit  of  DR  deviation  in  the  FSMI  attack  model.  Fig.  7 
illustrates the line loading rate of those three lines under three 
attacks with target on line 10, 28 and 23 respectively. All three 
DR attacks result in an increase in actual target line power flow; 
the increase for the attack targeting on line 10 is the greatest. 
However,  it  is  not  overloaded  even  when  the  load  shift 
deviation factor is set to 100%; this is because the loading rate 
of line 10 is low in the pre-attack state. For line 23, a congested 
line  in  the  pre-attack  state,  can  be  easily  and  significantly 
overloaded. From the perspective of an attacker, an attack on a 
congested  line  would  be  very  effective  even  with  limited 
resources.

FSMI attack with the attack target of line 10, line 28 and line 23 respectively. 

Fig. 8. Loading rate of line 23 with a limited-channel FSMI attack and an 
unlimited-channel FSMI attack model with the attack target of line 23. 

Fig. 8 shows the changes of line 23 loading rates with various 
 from 0 to 100 
settings of the total amount of DR deviation 
MW,  under  a  limited-channel  FSMI  attack  and  an  unlimited-
channel FSMI attack respectively. The maximal power flow on 
targeted  congested  line  23  increases  slightly  and  then  remain 
stable with a maximum line overload of 3.3 MW for a limited-
channel FSMI attack; however, the flow overload on the same 
line exceeds 18.9 MW when an unlimited-channel FSMI attack 
model is utilized. In Fig. 8,

 is set 0.3.

The impact of an unlimited-channel FSMI attack model on 
various demand scenarios was studied using the three demand 
scenarios: low, medium and high demand scenarios, where DR 
 is set 100 MW. The SCED-DR solution for high 
deviation 
demand and medium demand emphasizes that line 23 is always

congested, which implies it is more likely to be chosen as the 
targeted line. Fig. 9 illustrates the effect of the demand level in 
an unlimited-channel FSMI attack model on target branch 23. 
The simulation shows that loading rates always increase on the 
targeted  line.  Especially,  under  high  demand  and  medium 
demand  scenarios,  the  loading  rate  of  targeted  line  increases 
considerably whereas the increase in targeted line loading rate 
is marginal for low demand scenario.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 

A SCED model incorporating demand shifting as DR action 
for  real-time  applications  was  presented.  It  can  be  noted  that 
DR leads to substantial cost savings especially when the system 
is  congested.  DR  also  leads  to  significant  flattening  of  load 
profile in the short term by shifting demands in peak periods to 
non-peak periods. SCED-DR under low demand resulted in 0 
MW  of  demand  shifted  whereas  medium  and  high  demand 
resulted with 246 MW and 643 MW of cumulative DR actions 
respectively,  for  the  entire  time  period.  This  corresponds 
directly to a higher short-term load factor usage of 96.8% and 
96.4%  in  the  case  of  medium  and  high  demand  scenarios, 
respectively.  However,  if  these  DR  channels  are  hacked,  the 
system can  be vulnerable to targeted cyber-attacks that affect 
the system adversely. 

The  proposed  FSMI  cyber-attack  model  can  effectively 
manipulate  the  DR  signals  to  maximize  the  power  flow  on  a 
targeted line and thus overload the targeted line. Initially, the 
effectiveness of the limited-channel FSMI attack was analyzed 
by  modelling  the  attack  on  various  targeted  lines  along  with 
. Simulation results show 
their sensitivity to the key parameter 
that congested lines are more sensitive to the cyber-attack than 
non-congested  lines  and  they  can  be  overloaded  with  ease. 
Finally, the unlimited-channel FSMI attack was examined, and 
numerical  simulations  show  that  the  unlimited-channel  FSMI 
attack  leads  to  much  larger  line  overloads  than  the  limited-
channel FSMI attack. It is noted that high demand scenario may 
cause more significant overload than other scenarios.
