Abstract—  We  demonstrate  that  game-theoretic  calculations 
serve  as  a  useful  tool  for  assisting  cyber  wargaming  teams  in 
identifying  useful  strategies.  We  note  a  significant  similarity 
between  formulating  cyber  wargaming  strategies  and  the 
methodology  known  in  military  practice  as  Course  of  Action 
(COA)  generation.    For  scenarios  in  which  the  attacker  must 
penetrate  multiple 
in  a  defense-in-depth  security 
configuration,  an  accounting of attacker  and  defender costs and 
penetration  probabilities  provides  cost-utility  payoff  matrices 
and  penetration  probability  matrices.  These  can  be  used  as 
decision  tools  by  both  the  defender  and  attacker.    Inspection  of 
the  matrices  allows  players  to  deduce  preferred  strategies  (or 
COAs)  based  on  game-theoretical  equilibrium  solutions.    The 
matrices  also  help  in  analyzing  anticipated  effects  of  potential 
human-based  choices  of  wargame  strategies  and  counter-
strategies. 
  We  describe  a  mathematical  game-theoretic 
formalism  and  offer  detailed  analysis  of  a  table-top  cyber 
wargame  executed  at  the  US  Army  Research  Laboratory.    Our 
analysis shows how game-theoretical calculations can provide an 
effective tool for decision-making during cyber wargames.

Cyber  wargaming 

increasingly  often  used  by 
commercial and public-sector organizations. Such a wargame 
typically  involves  actual  employees  of  an  organization  who 
play  roles  in  a  human-based  (and  occasionally  computer-
based)  simulation  of  a  cyber  attack  and  responses  to  the 
attack.  A  number  of  consulting  organizations  provide 
wargaming  design  and  facilitation  as  a  service  [1].  The 
growing  prominence  of  cyber  wargames  is  hardly  surprising. 
Cyber  conflicts  involve  problems  of  adversarial  nature,  not 
unlike those in military practice, and these are often solved by 
resorting  to  game-theoretic  models,  or  by  simulations  – 
wargames.  

However,  theoretical  foundations  and  guidance  for  cyber 
wargaming  are  lacking.  In  this  paper,  we  offer  a  game-

theoretic  model  of  cyber  attack  and  defense,  compare  the 
model-based  analysis  with  experiences  of  an  actual  table-top 
wargame, and offer recommendations on using game-theoretic 
analysis  for  enhancing  accuracy  and  value  of  such  cyber 
wargames. 

A.  Current Practices of Cyber Wargaming 

In  spite  of  its  growing  popularity  among  corporate  and 
government  organizations  [2],  the  term  “cyber  wargame”  is 
not particularly  well  defined  and  may  refer  to many  different 
forms  of  an  exercise,  test,  simulation  or  emulation  event. 
Typically,  unlike  penetration  testing  in  which  “white  hat” 
hackers seek to find the company’s technical vulnerabilities, a 
corporate cyber wargame often places emphasis on a business 
scenario  involving  a  cross-section  of  the  company’s  business 
functions [3,4,5].  Modern cyber wargaming in corporate and 
government scenarios [6,7] utilize the insights and experience 
gained from military wargaming [8,9,10]. 

The  wargame  is  structured  –  often  by  a  specialized 
consulting organization hired for this purpose [1] – to simulate 
experiences of a real cyber attack, and realistic responses to it. 
Participants  of  the  wargame  often  comprise  the  company’s 
employees  from  multiple  functional  areas: 
information 
security,  application  development,  network  operations, 
facilities  management, 
production, 
marketing, legal and public affairs, financial, and distribution.. 
These players gather in one or several conference rooms, for a 
duration  of  anywhere  from  4  hours  to  3  days,  and  under  the 
guidance  of  professional  facilitators  proceed  to  enact  the 
events  of  a  cyber  attack,  usually  developing  a  strong 
commitment and passion in the game.

service, 

Great diversity in the types and forms of cyber wargames 
is  found  in  current  cyber  exercises.    Such  diversity  can  be 
characterized along several dimensions: 

  Breadth  of  business  functions:  the  focus  of  a 
wargame  may 
technical 
considerations  of  vulnerabilities,  capabilities  and 
activities  of  software  and  hardware,  to  a  broad 

strictly 

range 

from 

coverage of business functions, e.g., financial, media, 
legal  and  business  operations  aspects,  where  the 
technical cyber compromise is merely a starting point 
of the scenario. This may correlate with the seniority 
of  decision-makers  involved:  broader  scenarios  may 
involve leaders higher on the corporate ladder.  
  Scale  of  an  entity  under  consideration:  a  wargame 
may  concern  itself  with  an  entity  limited  to  a  single 
web  server  to  large-scale  operations  or  a  multi-
national  corporation;  it  could  be  a  single  system  or 
network,  a  site  or  an  enterprise  or  an  international 
system of enterprises.  

  Realism  of  the  game:  a  wargame  may  range  from  a 
tabletop  exercise  with  little  more  than  paper  and 
pencil;  to  computer-assisted  simulations;  to  use  of 
emulated  cyber  ranges;  and  even  to  attacks  on 
operational systems. 

The  process  of  designing,  implementing  and  executing  a 
cyber game normally involves most of the following steps (not 
necessarily  sequential  or  in  this  order).  They  could  be 
performed by a consulting organization in close collaboration 
with personnel of the company [2]:  

  Defenses:  Identify  security  mechanisms,  tools  and 

personnel; their attributes and capabilities.

  Threats:  Hypothesize 

their 
capabilities and likely TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and 
Procedures),  goals,  limitations,  access  opportunities, 
skill levels, time and resources available to them. 
  Attacks:  Formulate  and  select  attack  scenarios, 
including at least two -- most likely to be executed by 
the 
this  organization  and  most 
dangerous – the one that may be less likely but would 
cause the greatest damage.

  Players: Recruit relevant participants-defenders  from 
the  company;  who  are  relevant  to  the  site  or 
enterprise  being  wargamed;  and  who  would 
realistically be engaged in defending against a given 
a threat scenario. 

  Blue cell(s): Organize the participants-defenders into 
a  team  or  teams  responsible  for  planning  and 
executing  defensive  actions;  such  a  team  is  called  a 
Blue  cell;  preferably,  participants  are  organized  into 
teams  (cells)

that  are  reflective  of 
organizational structure of the company. 
  White  cell:  Provide  a  white  cell, 

trained 
individuals  who  have  experience  in  wargames  and 
can  document 
information  emerging 
during  the  wargame,  guide  and  facilitate  the  game, 
and  adjudicate  or  arbitrate  outcomes  of  individual 
actions  taken  by  participants.  These  are  usually 
outside consultants.

i.e., 

  Red  cell:  Provide  or  designate  a  team  of  individuals 
who  play  the  role  of  the  attacker;  such  a  team  is 
called the Red cell. 

  Rooms and Props: Prepare  physical  facilities,  means 
of communication, paper or computer-based products 
to conduct the game. 

  Play:  Assemble  all  cells,  begin  execution  of  the 
scenario, let the Red cell attack, Blue cell defend, and 
White  cell  declare  the  status  as  it  evolves  and  inject 
additional  events  to  keep  the  game  moving  in  the 
right direction. 

  Payoff:  Analyze  the  observations  and  results  of  the 

game, and formulate recommendations.  

The  outcomes  and  benefits  of  the  cyber  wargame  vary 
depending on the goals of the organization. These may include 
identification of hidden vulnerabilities, incorrect assumptions, 
and need for additional procedures and training.

B.  Military Practice of Course of Action Analysis 

Much of the techniques used in cyber wargaming appear to 
be  influenced  or  directly  borrowed  from  military  wargaming 
practices.  The  US  Navy  War  College  has  provided  extensive 
expertise  and  documented  guidance  for  military  wargaming 
[9,10].  In  the  US  Army,  wargaming  practice  is  often  called 
Course  of  Action  (COA)  Analysis  [11,12].  Although  such 
analysis is performed by military units of various sizes -- from 
a  small  unit  called  squad  to  a  very  large  organization  called 
corps – here we will use an example of a unit called Brigade 
Combat Team (BCT).  

Somewhat  comparable  to  a  mid-size  corporation,  a  US 
Army BCT includes several thousands of professional soldiers 
and  officers,  hundreds  of  combat  and  support  vehicles, 
helicopters,  sophisticated  intelligence  and  communication 
equipment  and  specialists,  artillery  and  missiles,  engineers, 
medical units, and repair shops. In a battle, these assets might 
perform hundreds of complex tasks of multiple types (similar 
to  corporate  “business  functions”):  collecting  intelligence; 
movements;  direct  and  indirect  fires;  constructing  roads, 
bridges,  and  obstacles;  transporting  and  handling  supplies; 
managing  the  civilian  population;  command  and  control,  and 
so on. Unlike in cyber  wargaming, the threat (i.e., the enemy 
that  the  BCT  fights  against)  tries  to  apply  much  physical 
destruction to the BCT, although cyber attack are often also a 
part of the threat’s repertoire.  

Detailed  planning  of  a  military  operation  requires  an 
intensive effort of highly trained professionals, called the BCT 
planning  staff.  Typically,  it  consists  of  four  or  five  officers, 
ranging  in  rank  from  captain  to  lieutenant  colonel,  who 
perform this work with the support of a subordinate staff. The 
process normally takes from two to eight hours – not unlike a 
typical  cyber  wargame.  The  physical  environment  often 
consists  of  a  tent  extended  from  the  back  of  one  or  several 
Army  trucks  or  armored  command-and-control  vehicles; 
folding tables and chairs, and -- similarly to a cyber wargame -

- either computer screens or paper maps on which the officers 
draw symbols of units and arrows of movements. 

The input for the staff’s effort comes usually from the unit 
commander  as  a  high-level  specification  of  the  operation. 
With this input, the planning staff works as a team – called the 
Blue cell – perform actual wargaming, including: 

  Predicting  enemy  actions  or  reactions.  This  is  done 
by the Red cell, usually the officer who specializes in 
collecting  and  analyzing  enemy  intelligence  [13].  
The Red cell plays the role of the enemy in order to 
help  the  Blue  cell  understand  possibly  actions  and 
responses  of  the  enemy.  Similarly  to  the  cyber 
wargames,  Red  cell  provides  two  cases  of  enemy 
actions:  the  most  likely  plan  of  enemy  actions,  and 
the  most  dangerous  (to  the  BCT)  plan  of  enemy 
actions.  The  latter  might  be  the  same  as  the  former, 
but usually is different as it involves  assumptions of 
greater capabilities on the part of the enemy. 

  Planning  and  scheduling  the  detailed  tasks  required 
to accomplish the specified COA [14], and to prevent 
or  respond  to  the  threat  actions  (like  the  Blue  cell 
defenders  would  do  in  a  cyber  wargame),  and 
allocating tasks to the diverse forces constituting the 
BCT (like elements of a corporate response to cyber 
attack). 

  Estimating  success  of  failure  of  friendly  and  enemy 
actions, and battle losses [15].  This is similar to the 
function  performed  by  the  White  cell  in  cyber 
wargaming. 

  The process of estimating enemy actions and friendly 
actions  may  repeat 
in  several  cycles  until  a 
convergence  is  achieved:  the  Red  cell  is  unable  to 
suggest  any  further  improvements  of  the  enemy 
actions,  and  the  Blue  cell  is  unable  to  suggest  any 
further  improvements  of  the  friendly  actions.  This 
hints at reaching something akin to Nash equilibrium, 
in game theoretic terms. 

This  wargaming  usually  produces  a  plan/schedule  in  a 
synchronization  matrix  format,  a  type  of  Gantt  chart  (see 
Figure  1).  The  chart’s  columns  represent  time  periods.  The 
rows contain  functional classes  of actions,  such as  Maneuver 
(which  in  turn  includes  such  subclasses  as  Main  Effort  and 
Security),  Combat  Service  Support  (for  example,  logistics), 
Military Intelligence, and so on. This plan-schedule’s content, 
recorded  largely  in  the  matrix  cells,  includes  the  tasks  and 
actions  of  the  friendly  force’s  subunits  and  assets,  their 
objectives  and  manner  of  execution,  expected 
timing, 
dependencies  and  synchronization,  routes  and  locations, 
availability  of  supplies,  combat  losses,  enemy  situation  and 
actions, and so on.  

Ultimately, the purpose of the military wargame is for the 
Blue cell to consider and select a small (manageable, often on 
the  order  of  three)  number  of  COAs  that  are  seen  as  most 
advantageous to the Blue side.  In doing so, the Blue cell has 
to make an assumption about the COA that would be adopted 
by the Red side. In military wargaming, there are several ways 
to approach this difficult decision. 

Figure 1: Fragment of a wargaming output in a synchronization-matrix 
format, adapted from [14].  The horizontal axis is time and the vertical 
axis describes specific wargame functions.  

One approach is to consider the “most likely” COA of the 
opponent,  i.e.,  the  Red  COA  that  the  Blue  cell  feels  is  most 
likely  to  be  adopted  by  the  Red  side.  This  assessment  of 
likelihood  might  be  based  on  Blue  cell’s  knowledge  of  the 
Red  side’s  preferences,  e.g.,  the  COAs  that  the  Red  side  has 
adopted in previous battles. Alternatively, the Blue cell might 
decide that the most likely Red COA is the one that provides 
the Red side  with the  greatest  advantage  or  greatest utility  in 
the battle. 

Another  approach  might  be  to  consider  the  “most 
dangerous”  or  “most  damaging”  Red  COA  –  the  COA  that 
would  cause  the  greatest  damage  to  the  Blue  side.  Note  that 
the  “most  likely”  and  “most  damaging”  Red  COAs  are  often 
different.  

Having  selected  the  “most  likely”  Red  COA,  and  the 
“most damaging” Red COA, the Blue cell usually attempts to 
select  a  Blue  COA  that  would  perform  sufficiently  well 
against both of the Red COAs.  

incorrect  assumptions,  risks  and 

Besides  creating  this  tangible  set  of  potential  strategies, 
other  valuable  outcomes  of  this  wargaming  are  similar  to 
those  of  corporate  cyber  wargames:  identification  of  hidden 
vulnerabilities, 
losses, 
education, clarity of roles and responsibilities.  It is important 
to  note  that  the  execution  and  modeling  of  a  wargame  is  not 
necessarily  representative  of  a  real-world  encounter.    Real-
world  actors  likely  do  not  have  complete  knowledge  of  the 
strategies and limitations of their opponents  and  a systematic 
or mathematical formulation for computing optimal strategies 
may  be  difficult  or  impractical.    While  complex  models  may 
be able to be constructed for real-world scenarios, it is outside 
the scope of this paper to do so; our simple model is mean to 
apply  only to cyber wargaming. 

In  the  remainder  of  the  paper,  we  first  propose  a  game-
theoretic model of a contest between cyber attacker and cyber 
defender. Then we describe an actual cyber wargame designed 
and  led  by  one  of  this  paper’s  authors.  We  explore  how  our 
theoretical  model  may  apply  to  the  actual  wargame.  Finally, 

we  discuss  the  insights  and  benefits  that  the  model  brings  to 
the  cyber  wargame,  and  offer  a 
set  of  practical 
for  designing  and  conducting  cyber

II.  GAME-THEORETIC METHOD 

In this section, we formulate an approach to analysis 
of a cyber wargame problem that combines elements of game 
theoretic  and  risk  analytic  treatments.  We  believe  our 
approach  is  useful  as  a  computational  tool  to  aid  in  complex 
wargame and training exercises in which the strategy space is 
larger  or  more  complex  than  is  normally  possible  for  most 
humans  to  explore.    In  a  later  section  of  the  paper,  we  then 
discuss  an  example  of  a  real-world  process  where  an 
approximation of this approach is used. 

A.  Mathematical Model 

In the following formulation, we are partly inspired by [16].  
Consider a cyber-physical system in Figure 2.  For this system, 
a  cyber attacker desires to obtain  a  benefit 
 by  accessing  the 
system via the Internet and eventually obtaining control of the 
plant’s  Programmable  Logic  Controller  (PLCs).    In  doing  so, 
the attacker would have to penetrate defensive mechanisms and 
overcome  actions  of  the  defenders  in  several  layers  of  the 
cyber-physical system.  

To make the discussion more general, in Figure 3, we 
illustrate an abstract notion of the problem: an attacker enters 
the  outer  attack  surface  with  the  intention  of  penetrating  a 
series of layers guarded by the defender before arriving at the 
target.  Penetration of the layers will require specific malicious 
actions,  and  the  overall  path  to  the  target  determines  the 
precise attacker “strategy” that the attacker intends to use.  
We describe the plans of the attacker with a set of

be modified as the situation demands.

Once  the  attacker  and  defender  costs  and  penetration 
 and 
 can  be  computed  and  inspected  by  each  player  to 
determine their preferred strategy.  In this section, we describe 
four  methods  by  which  the  defenders  and  attackers  in  the 
wargame  may  choose  their  strategy.    We  discuss  these 
methods  in  more  detail  in  section  IV,  in  the  context  of  the 
specific case study outlined in section III.   
Pure Strategy Equilibria 

We  first  describe  the  case  in  which  the  players 
choose  a  single  unique  strategy  (pure  strategy  approach)  as 
opposed  to  estimating  a  probabilistically  weighted  set  of 
multiple strategies (a.k.a. mixed strategy approach). 

The model outlined in section II.A does not describe

the number of strategies considered will be low enough to be 
manageable  by  a  human,  manual  methods  can  be  used  to 
search for a local saddle point or a Nash equilibrium. 

 and 

That is, if we search over each defense strategy j for

 of the defender 

(4b) 

, 

and  find  saddle  points  in  the  payoff  matrices,  one  or  more 
“most  likely”  equilibrium  strategies  may  be  found.    If  only 
one  equilibrium  point  is  found,  it  is  by  definition  a  Nash 
equilibrium.    We  illustrate  this  method  further  in  sections  III 
and IV. 

Equilibrium strategies such as these may be preferred 
by  the players in the case  when  the payoff  matrices are  fully 
disclosed  to  both  players  and  both  players  must  choose  their 
strategy simultaneously. 

Strong Stackelberg Strategy Equilibria 

A common method for finding solutions to non zero-
sum  games  is  assume  that  one  of  the  players  has  the 
opportunity to be first in selecting his strategy, and chooses a 
mixed strategy solution and the opponent follows with a pure 
strategy  (i.e.  a  single  strategy  with  100%  probability).    The 
equilibrium  strategies  in  this  scenario  are  known  as  Strong 
Stackelberg  Equilibria  (SSE)  [17,18].    If  the  wargame  is 
played  in  this  manner,  the  leader  and  the  follower  could  use 
one  of  the  many  methods  for  finding  SSE  solutions,  such  as 
those  described  in  [19].    While  we  do  not  discuss  SSE 
equilibria  further  in  this  work,  we  later  consider  an  example 
where multiple strategies are considered to some extent. 
Playing Against the Most Likely Strategy of the Opponent 

As  described  in  section  I.B,  a  player  may  choose  a 
strategy  by  first  estimating  the  “most  likely”  strategy  of  the 
opponent,  based  on  any  available  information  about  the 
opponent.  Then  the  player  selects  his  own  strategy  based  on 
how successful it will be against the “most likely” strategy of 
the opponent. 
Playing Against the Most Damaging Strategy of the Opponent 
Alternatively,  as  described  in  section  I.B,  a  player  may 
choose  a  strategy  by  first  estimating  the  “most  damaging” 
strategy  of  the  opponent,  i.e.,  the  strategy  in  which  the 
opponent would impose the most severe losses on the player. 
Then  the  player  selects  his  own  strategy  based  on  how 
successful  it  will  be  against  the  “most  damaging”  strategy  of 
the opponent. 

C.  Sample Calculation 

To illustrate,  we  provide  sample calculations for a  simple 
scenario.  Suppose a freelancing cyber-crime group is engaged 
by  an  anonymous  third  party  to  penetrate  controls  of  a 
munitions  plant.  Two  layers  of  the  network  need  to  be 
defeated: 
.  If  successful,  the  attacker  will  be 
paid  a  benefit 
 of  $50k.    The  defender  of  the  plant 
consistently uses a single strategy

Based  on  the  preliminary  reconnaissance  of  the  plant’s 
network,  the  attacker  considers  two  possible  strategies.  The

D.  Practical Considerations 

To  generalize,  the  overall  process  for  calculating  the 

game-theoretic quantities in section II.A is: 
information 

1.  Collect 

about 
and 

, 

 from  empirical  and  experimental 

sources 

2.  Compute cost-utility functions (payoff  matrices) and 
total  penetration  probability  matrix  using  Equations 
(1), (2), and (3) 

3.  Utilize  the  payoff  matrices  to  determine  the  best 

strategy (see section II.B) 

 and 

The most difficult step may be the first one.  Quantitative 
 in  our  illustrative 
data,  such  as 
example,  come  from  subject  matter  experts  and  may  be 
difficult to estimate.  Obtaining such information, particularly 
from subject matter expects, may be a difficult and expensive

E.  Relation to Military Wargaming Practics 

As  described  in  section  I.B,  the  practice  and  process  of 
military  wargaming  (COA  analysis)  is  as  follows.  Having 
collected  and  considered  the  relevant  information,  the  Blue 
cell  officers  propose  a  friendly  defense  strategy

locations.  This  strategy  is  recorded  in  the  synchronization 
matrix (Figure 1). Then the Red cell who plays the role of the

produces  a  modified  strategy
 and  so  on.    In  each 
iteration,  and  for  each  activity,  the  planning  team  uses  its 
experience  and  doctrinal  guides  to  determine  whether  the 
activity  will  succeed,  and  how  much  losses  each  side  will 
encounter  as  the  result  of  the  activity.  These  iterations 
continue  until  equilibrium  is  reached  where  the  Red  cell  is 
unable  to  suggest  any  further  improvements  to  their  attack 
strategy,  and  the  Blue  cell  is  unable  to  suggest  any  further 
improvements  to  their  defense  strategy,  or  both  cells  are 
exhausted  in  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  find  such  an 
equilibrium. Implicitly or explicitly, the losses are expected to 
be kept below some maximum allowable value.  In the human 
wargame  activity,  risk  is  often  assessed  qualitatively  by  the 
players  by  estimating  the  likelihood  of  accomplishing  the 

Figure 4: Process map for the production line in the ficticious AQUA plant 

for  determining  subsequent  strategies  in  the  wargame  where 
targets in the layers have been compromised and costs need to 
be  modified  dynamically,  such  a  framework  could  be 
constructed using the same methodology. 

III.  EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF CYBER-WARGAMING 

A.  General 

As a more elaborate example, we consider the application 
of  our  game-theoretical  framework  to  a  table-top  wargaming 
activity conducted at the US Army Research Laboratory [20].  
In this event, a fictitious AQUA cyber-physical control system 
(specifically,  an  Industrial  Control  System  [ICS])  was 
designed and presented to two teams of human cyber experts – 
a RED team (i.e., Red cell) and a BLUE team (i.e. Blue cell) -- 
representing the attacker and defender, respectively. 

B.  AQUA Wargame Information Packet 

A technical information packet [21] describing the AQUA 
ICS  was  provided  to  both  teams  before  the  exercise  began.  
Highlights from the information packet follow. 

The  AQUA  ICS  is  a  food  processing  plant  that  produces 
packaged  meals.    The  process  map  for  our  fictitious  AQUA 
  The  plant  executes  six

manufacturing  processes.    The  meat  and  vegetables  are 
cooked  separately.  Once  they  are  cooked,  the  meals  are 
prepared and packaged in a material suitable for high-pressure 
processing.  Once  the  high-pressure  process  is  completed,  the 
meals are placed in boxes and stored in a warehouse. 

D.  Description of Game-theoretic Variables 

Attack and Defense Strategies 

The  RED  team  submitted  five  attack  strategies 

, which we list in Table 1.

Human Interface 
Device Attack 

First  the  RED  team  gains  access  by  cracking 
the  password  of  the  wireless  network.  The 
authentication credentials of the wireless tablets 
are  then  spoofed  to  penetrate  the  rest  of  the 
plant  network.  Complete  control  of  the  PLC 
traffic is then gained. 
The  RED  team  coerces  a  plant  employee  to 
install a rogue wireless device or malware into 
the  plant  network.  The  RED  team,  via  remote 
access  to  the  wireless  device  or  via  malware, 
then misdirects commands to the PLCs. 

Posing  as  a  rival  employer  searching  for  new 
hires,  the  RED  team  acquires  vital  plant 
information  by  interviewing  plant  employees. 
When  a  job  opening  becomes  available  at  the 
AQUA plant, an insider sponsored by the RED 
team  takes  the  job  and  consequently  performs 
malicious  activity  to  gain  access  to  the  plant 
network and the PLCs. 
The  plant  machine  that  writes  the  media  for 
patching the plant equipment is attacked.  Once 
that  machine 
is  owned,  malware  with 
capabilities  for  disrupting,  destroying  and 
Command  and  Control  (C2)  is  installed  and 
executed strategically. 
A  human  interface  device  (HID),  such  as  a 
USB mouse, is infected with malware.  It then 
launches  additional  malware  into  the  plant 
network, ultimately disrupting or destroying the 
plant processes.  

Table 1: RED Team Attack Strategies. 

The  BLUE  team  proposed  15  specific  mitigations 
(see  Table  2)  for  their  defense  against  the  proposed  attack 
strategies.    Since  it  is  not  feasible  to  consider  all  possible 
(
) defender  strategies that could be 
constructed  from  the  15  mitigations,  four  defense  strategies 
   were  identified  by  selecting  specific 
mitigations.    These  four  strategies  offer  potentially  good 
security  with  reasonably  acceptable  costs.    A  fifth  strategy 
“No  Action”  was also noted  and is identified here as  j=0 for 
reference.  Defender mitigation costs were estimated manually 
by the BLUE team and are also listed in the table.  Complete 
details about the attack and defense strategies can be found in 
[20] and [22].  
Defender Computations 

We next describe our game-theoretical computations.  
Since  all  strategies  by  both  BLUE  and  RED  teams  were 
known  by  both  teams  in  the  exercise,  costs  and  penetration 
probabilities  of  the  RED  team  were  estimated  based  on  the 
BLUE  team  mitigations.    We  therefore  discuss  the  defender 
mitigations and computations first. 

Figure 5: Plant Network used to control the AQUA Production Line 

The plant network used by the AQUA is shown in Figure 
5.  It  consists  of  six  programmable  logic  controllers  (PLCs), 
several  workstations,  a  closed  circuit  television  (CCTV) 
system,  and  a  wireless  network  for 
tablet  computers. 
Technicians  use  the  tablet  computers  to  access  the  human 
machine  interface  (HMI)  displays.    The  plant  network  is  not 
connected to the corporate network or the Internet.   All plant 
machinery  is  hard-wired  to  the  input  and  output  modules  of 
the  PLCs.  The  CCTV  cameras  are  hard-wired  to  the  digital 
video recorder (DVR).   

C.  Cyber Wargame Method and Execution 

Before  the  wargame  began,  in  addition  to  reviewing  the 
information  packet  read-ahead  document,  both  teams  were 
allowed  to  ask  the  game  facilitators  specific  technical 
questions.  Answers were shared with both teams. During the 
exercise, the RED and BLUE teams  met separately to review 
all  of  the  technical  information  and  discuss  strategies.    Each 
team  documented  their  potential  strategies.    After  this,  the 
teams  converged  to  share  their  findings.    The  RED  team 
shared 
team.  
Mitigations,  counter-attacks,  and  counter-mitigations  were 
discussed.  Details about the RED team strategies and BLUE 
team mitigations can be found in [20].  The representation of 
those  results  in  terms  of  our  game-theoretic  framework 
(section II.A) is described in the following subsections.

Table 3: Penetration Layers for Attack 

The  vector  defining  defender  costs  by  mitigation  m, 

 is  also  constructed  (see  Table  2).    We  use  the  translation 
matrix 
 to  compute  defender  strategy  costs  as  a  function 
of defender j:   

where 
implies  summation  (matrix  multiplication) 
over m.  Note that defender costs are independent of attacker 
strategies  i  in  this  table-top  wargame  example.    This  is  a 
generalized  case  of  our  game-theoretic  framework  described 
in section II.A. 

Although the defender costs are not dependent on the 
attacker  strategies  {i},  we  construct  the  defender  cost  matrix 
over {ij}: 

, 

and  use  it  to  compute  the  defender  utility.    Here,  we  have 
assumed  that  the  defender  strives  to  keep  the  portion  of  the 
defender’s  assets  b  that  would  have  otherwise  been  forfeited 
to  the attacker  as a  benefit.  The probability that those  assets 
are not forfeited is 

.   
We can then compute the defender cost utility as: 

, 

where 

 is computed below. 

Attacker Computations 

 Four  attack  layers  (cf.  Figure  3)  were  identified  by 
the RED team.  We reference the attack layers with index {l} 
and list descriptions of the layers in Table 3. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Attacker  costs  were  estimated  by  the  RED  team  for 
each  attack  strategy 
 Costs  were  estimated  generally  as  a 
function of BLUE team mitigation.  This differs slightly from 
our  mathematical  framework  which  requires  costs  as  a 
function  of  {ij},  so  we  must  translate  the  RED  team  input 
appropriately.  We  separate  the  attacker  costs  according  to 
whether  the  costs  were  dependent  on  defender  strategies 
(mitigations)  or  not. 
independent  of 
mitigations  and  are  listed  in  Table  4.    Differential  costs  are 
dependent on  mitigations  and are  listed in Table 5.   Many of 
the  fixed  costs  are  associated  with  preliminary  research, 
reconnaissance,  and  bribes  which  occur  before  the  attack 
begins, i.e., before penetration of layer 1.

dependent  on  BLUE  team  mitigations.    We  again  assume 
labor costs of 1k$ per hour of RED team activity. 

Next, we utilize the RED team input from Table 5 to 
and  penetration 
construct  differential  attacker  cost 
matrices,  one  for  each  attack  {i}.    Since  the 
probability 
RED  team  cost  definitions  are  dependent  on  BLUE  team 
mitigations  and  penetration  layer,  we  index  these  matrices 
over layer l and mitigation m.  While this information could be 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stored  and  computed  using  3-dimensional  matrices 

, for the purposes of illustration, we use five separate 
and 
2-dimensional matrices (one for each attack i) in the following 
discussion. 

For example, for attack 3, by examining Table 5, we 
 and  penetration 

can  construct  differential  cost 
probability matrices

Since  our  game-theoretical  model

The  differential  penetration  probabilities  for  the 
mitigations  are  also  computed  from  information  provided  by 
the attacker (given in Table 5) by constructing the differential 
penetration  probabilities

mitigation {m}: 

=  

 . 

Each  entry  is  computed  by  multiplying  probabilities 
over  layers  {l}  for  each  {i,m}  combination.    For  example, 
from  Table  5,  attack  2,  mitigation  8  has  penetration 
probabilities  of  0.5  for  each  of  layers  2,  3,  and  5,  so  that

 is  constructed,  we  then  use  the  translation 
to calculate and redistribute the probabilities as a 
matrix 
function  of  defender  strategy  j.    For  example, 
for  attack 
i=3 and defense j=2 includes mitigations 1, 6, 9, 10, and 12, 
which  have  probabilities  of  success  of  1.0,  1.0,  1.0,  0.7,  and 
0.0, respectively.  These five values multiply to 
= 0.0.  
Continuing  this  process,  we  find  the  resulting  differential 
probabilities  of  success  for  all  layers  {l},  as  a  function  of 
attack and defense strategies {i,j} is: 

 = 

We next need to condense {l} and construct a single 
differential  cost  matrix  for  all  attacks  {i}.    By  summing  row 
 for attack 3, 
vectors over {l}, we obtain 
and  perform  similar  calculations  for  the  other  four  attacks.  
The differential cost matrix 

over {i,j} is then: 

The  total  probability  matrix  can  then  be  computed  by  taking 
the  element-by-element  product  with  the  fixed  probability 
matrix:

We can now compute the total attacker cost matrix 
{i,j}:

The  utility  cost  of  the  attacker 
 is  computed  from

IV.  DISCUSSION 

As described in section II, the objective of our game-theoretic 
model is to provide a useful analytical tool for the attacker and 
defender  to  select  their  strategies  based  on  cost  utilities

Table  7:  Attacker  Cost  Utility 
 for  attack  and  defense 
strategies  {i,j}computed from RED team input from Table 4  and 
Table 5 

For  convenience,  we  provide 

the  attacker  and 
defender  cost  utilities  (payoff  matrices)  and  total  penetration 
probability  matrix  in  Table  7,  Table  6  and  Table  8, 
respectively. 

As mentioned, in both our table-top wargame and our 
game-theoretic  framework  (section  II),  we  assume  that 
defender  and  attacker  have  full  knowledge  of  all  player 
strategies  and  costs,  and  are  able  to  compute  the  utility  and 
penetration probability matrices.

Given  all  this  information,  how  should  players  select  the 
most advantageous strategies? Earlier in sections I.B and II.B, 
we  discussed  general  approaches  to  such  a  selection.  In  the 
those 
following  sections,  we  consider  how 
approaches in our example wargame.

A.   Pure Strategy Equilibrium 

If  both  players  select  their  strategies  simultaneously 
and  each  act  to  maximize  their  own  utility,  an  equilibrium 
strategy pair will exist if the conditions outlined in section II.B 
lead  to  a  single  unique  strategy  pair.    That  is,  there  is  a 
strategy  pair 
 that  is  a  preferred  (“most  likely”) 
strategy  for  both  players.  To  translate  this  into  a  military 
analogy,  a  single  unique  strategy  pair  might  mean  that  the 
defender  prefers  to  defend  at  the  same  position  where  the 
attacker  prefers  to  attack.  In  the  shorthand  notation  of 
Equations  (4a)  and  (4b), 
 are 
unique.  For our table-top exercise, the preferred strategies are 
shown  in  Table  9.    These  values  are  found  manually  by 
identifying  the  maximum  attacker  cost  utility  across  the 
columns  in  Table 7  and  the  maximum defender utility across 

 and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the rows in Table 8.  Preferred defender strategies are marked 
with an “A” and preferred attacker strategies are marked with 
a  “D.”    As  one  can  see,  there  is  no  single  {ij}  pair  such  that 
both  i  and  j  are  preferred  strategies,  thus  there  is  no 
equilibrium solution. To rephrase, there is no such a case here 
that the defender and the attacker prefer the same combination 
of their respective strategies. 

C.  Playing Against the Most Likely Strategy of the Opponent 

Suppose  the  BLUE  team  has  additional  information  that 
the attacker tends to be risk-averse. In that case, the attacker is 
likely  to  prefer  i=5  over  i=1,  because  i=1  might  cause  the 
attacker heavy loss (-193.25 in case the defender selects j=4). 
With this, the BLUE team can conclude that the attacker has a 
single “most likely” strategy i=5. In that case, the BLUE team 

However, consider a situation where players are uncertain 
about  cost  and  benefit  estimates  –  a  likely  situation  in  the 
domain  of  cybersecurity.    The  players  may  decide  instead  to 
use  the  penetration  probabilities  alone  as  utility  functions  so 
that  the  attacker  aims  to  maximize 
 and  the  defender  aims 
to minimize the same value.  That is, they intend to choose the 
most  or  least  probably  success  of  acquiring  the  target 
regardless of the cost.  Their respective preferred strategies in 
this  case  are  shown  in  Table  10.    Here  the  maximum  across 
rows and columns is calculated in the same manner using the 
probability  penetration  matrix  (Table  8).    Note  that  multiple 
maxima and minima are found since some cells have the same 
value  across  the  rows  or  columns.    In  this  case,  there  is  a 
single  common  preferred  strategy  pair  {5,4}  that  will  satisfy 
both  players  as  an  equilibrium  point,  so  that  if  each  player 
used  this  method  to  make  a  decision,  no  alternative  strategy 
would give any players an advantage. To rephrase, in this case 
the attacker is satisfied that that the defender picks the strategy 
4,  and  the  defender  is  satisfied  that  the  attacker  picks  the 
strategy 5. 

B.  Considering Multiple Strategies of the Opponent 

Although  we  are  not  exploring  here  a  mixed-strategy 
approach,  such  as  the  Strong  Stackelberg  Strategy  Equilibria 
mentioned  earlier,  we  can  consider  multiple  strategies  in  our 
example  wargame.  For  the  sake  of  concreteness,  let’s  adopt 
the perspective of the  BLUE  team, the defenders. Looking at 
Table 7, the BLUE team would notice that from the attacker’s 
perspective  strategy  i=5  is  generally  better  than  i=4.  Indeed, 
with  i=5,  the  attackers  gains  better  utility  for  all  defense 
strategies except j=0, and even in the case of j=0, the benefit 
of  i=4  for  the  attacker  is  insignificant  (460  vs  465).  Thus,  if 
the  cost  utility  is  the  primary  consideration  for  the  attacker, 
the  attacker  would  surely  select  i=5  over  i=4.  Similar 
considerations  may  apply  when  the  BLUE  team  explores  the 
attacker’s  strategies  i=1,  2  and  3.  After  consideration,  the 
BLUE  team  might  conclude  that  it  needs  to  select  a  strategy 
that  defends  the  best  against  both  strategies  i=1  and  i=5.  
Then, looking at Table 6, the BLUE team may decide that the 
defense  strategy  j=4  offers  the  BLUE  team  a  relatively  safe 
defense  (in  terms  of  cost  utility)  against  both  i=1  and  i=5.  
Thus, the BLUE team could select j=4 as its preferred strategy 
in this manner based on the cost-utility matrices.  To rephrase, 
here the defender decided that the most likely strategies of the 
attacker are the strategy 5 and the strategy 1, and then selected 
its own strategy 4 as it provides  better  outcomes  whether  the 
attacker chooses 5 or 1.

selects defense strategy j=1 (with its defender’s cost utility of 
685)  as  its  best  play  against  the  attacker’s  i=5.  To  rephrase, 
here the defender decided that the one most likely strategy of 
the attacker is the strategy 5, and then selected its own strategy 
4  as  the  most  likely  to  bring  the  best  outcome  against  the 
attacker’s strategy 5. 

D.  Playing Against the Most Damaging Strategy of the 

Opponent 

  Alternatively,  the  BLUE  team  might  consider  on  how  to 
avoid  heavy  losses,  rather  than  how  to  gain  best  cost  utility. 
Looking at Table 6, the BLUE team would notice the attacker 
strategy i=1 brings the defender the least utility against 4 out of 
5 defense strategies. In other words, the attacker strategy i=1 is 
the “most damaging” to the defender. In this case, j=4 could be 
a  strong  strategy  for  the  defender.  However,  considering  that 
the  “most  likely”  strategy  of  the  attacker  is  i=5  (as  we 
determined above), it is safer for the BLUE team to select j=1, 
which  gives  the  BLUE  team  a  relatively  good  cost  utility  of 
235  even  if  the  attacker  selects  the  “most  damaging”  i=1.  To 
rephrase,  here  the defender decides to  focus  on  two  strategies 
of  the  attacker  –  the  most  likely  strategy  5  and  the  most 
damaging strategy 1 – and then selects its own strategy 1 that 
offers  acceptable  losses  regardless  of  whether  the  attacker 
chooses the attacker’s strategy 5 or 1.  

E.  Consequential Moves 

In  summary,  our  game-theoretic  model  computations 
outlined  in  section  II.A  offer  a  set  of  tools  in  the  form  of 
matrices that the wargame players may use for selecting their 
initial  strategies.    While  we  do  not  describe  consequential 
strategies  in  this  work,  the  model  could  be  adapted  so  that 
to  consider 
similar  matrix  calculations  could  be  used 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consequential  strategies.    Both  teams  would  need  to  reassess 
new  costs  and  penetration  probabilities  given  their  current 
position in the game.  An elaborate game-in-game theoretical 
framework  for  solving  a  complete  path  through  the  layers  of 
defense is described in [23].  In implementing such a decision 
scheme  in  practice,  one  must  incorporate  the  effects  that 
increasingly  accurate  information  of  the  attacker  has  on  his 
consequential moves as he penetrates the layers. 

In  the  case  that  either  the  defender  or  the  attacker  selects 
his  strategy  first  and  the  opponent  follows,  any  of  the  SSE 
computational  methods  may  be  used  to  find  a  vector  of 
weights  for the leader initial  strategy  [19].  The follower  can 
then  use  the  payoff  and  penetration  probability  matrix  to 
decide on his next strategy. 

V.  CONCLUSIONS 

While  our  methods  may  have  limitations  in  real-world 
scenarios, the game-theoretic model we outlined in this paper 
is suitable for assisting wargaming teams.  We demonstrate an 
application  of  our  model  to  a  fairly  realistic  wargame  for 
which  opposing  teams  have  complete  knowledge  of  the 
system and each others’ strategies.. Specifically,  we  find that 
the  use  of  the  model  benefits  the  participants  of  a  cyber 
wargame in several ways: 

A.  Elucidation of costs, benefits and assumptions 

The  players  –  either  within  a  single  team  or  in  joint 
discussions by both BLUE and RED teams – are motivated to 
explicitly define, quantify and document  a  number  of  critical 
elements  of  their  decision  making  process.  They  discuss  and 
document  layers  of  the  defense  that  the  attacker  must 
penetrate.  They  think  about  costs  and  benefits  from  the 
perspective  of  both  teams.  They  are  compelled  to  search  for 
additional  pertinent  information  about  costs  and  timing  of 
attacks  and  of  defensive  mitigations,  as  well  as  their 
probabilities of success. They uncover and clarify inconsistent 
assumptions. Ultimately, they either arrive to a well-reasoned 
consensus  or  to  a  clear  understanding  of  where  the  opinions 
differ.  All  these  considerations  and  conclusions  are  likely  to 
be  well-documented  as  a  result  of  these  steps  in  the 
wargaming process 

B.  Enhancement of potential strategies 

Having  distilled  their  assumptions  and  estimates  into 
overall  quantifications  of  utilities  and  probabilities  (such  as 
Table 7, Table 6, and Table 8), the BLUE and RED teams can 
examine  the  data  for  the  purposes  of  identifies  opportunities 
for strategy improvements. For example, the RED team might 
notice  that  attack  strategy  i=4  is  clearly  inferior  to  i=5,  from 
the perspective of the attacker cost utility. Should the strategy 
i=4 be eliminated from the attacker’s repertoire?  Or, is this an 
indication of incomplete or inaccurate information somewhere 
in  the  process?  Or,  could  the  strategy  i=4  be  improved  in  a 
way  that  would  make  it  competitive  with  i=5?  These  are 
questions  that  are  not  likely  to  be  asked  –  or  answered  -- 
without such a quantitative analysis. 

C.  Aticulated selection of strategies  

The  players  can  use  this  analytical  process  to  engage  in 
rational assessment of alternatives, and arrive to a selection of 
an  appropriate  strategy  in  a  well-reasoned  manner.  The 
reasons for preferring a certain strategy can be clearly stated, 
often in a quantitative manner, and underlying reasons can be 
readily  explained.  Without  such  an  analytical  tool,  cyber 
wargamers  often  have  difficulties  making  a 
rational, 
explainable strategy selection.  

D.  Future Research 

While this line of research can be extended in a number of 
directions,  one  of  them  is  particularly  salient:  relaxing  the 
assumption  that  both  the  attacker  and  the  defender  have  full 
knowledge  of  the  systems  and  technologies  available  to  both 
this  simplifying  assumption  raises 
sides.  Relaxation  of 
numerous  challenging  research  questions.  For  example,  how 
to make appropriate assumptions about the opponent’s lack of 
knowledge?  How  does  making  such  an  assumption  increases 
the risk that the selected strategy  might fail if the assumption 
is  wrong?  How  can  such  relaxation  of  assumptions  be 
portrayed realistically in a human wargaming?
