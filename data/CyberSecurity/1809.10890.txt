Abstract 

Information  Systems  security  cannot  be  fully  apprehended  if  the  user  lacks  the 
required  knowledge  and  skills  to  effectively  apply  the  safeguard  measures. 
Knowledge  and  skills  enhance  one’s  self-efficacy.  Individual  self-efficacy  is  an 
important element in  ensuring Information Systems safeguard effectiveness.  In this 
research,  we  explore  the  role  of  individual’s  self-efficacy  for  Information  Systems 
security adoption. The  study uses the method of Systematic Literature Review  using 
42 extant studies to evaluate individual self- efficacy for Information Systems security 
innovation  adoption.  The  systematic  review findings reveal  the  appropriateness of 
the  existing  empirical  investigations  on  the  individual  self-efficacy  for  Information 
Systems  security  adoption.  Furthermore, 
the  review  results  confirmed  the 
significance  of  the  relationship  between  individual  self-efficacy  and  Information 
Systems  security  adoption.  In  addition,  the  study  validates  the  past  administration 
of  the  research  on  this  subject  in  terms  of  sample  size,  sample  subject  and 
theoretical  grounds.

1.  Introduction 

Information  Systems  (IS)  assets  (information  and computer resources) are at risk 
from a variety of threats, including virus, worms, Trojans, spyware, scare-ware, crime-
ware,  key-loggers,  botnet,  DDoS,  browser-  hijackers,  pharming,  phishing  etc.  [8]. 
Such  attacks  commonly  referred  to  as  ‘IS  security  threats’  mainly  intended  to 

 
 
 
 
improperly disclose,  modify or  delete  sensitive information  and maliciously destruct 
and  destroy computer resources  [23]. New prospect  the  internet has presented to 
the users have in fact, offered  criminals  and  individuals  with  a  vicious  mind-set  to 
misuse IS assets aimlessly. 

To thwart  IS security threats and safeguard  organisational  IS  assets  in  general, 
a combination of measures is taken such as the installation of anti-virus,  anti-spyware 
and  anti-phishing  software,  setting  up  firewalls,  maintaining  and  restricting  access 
controls, using intrusion detection and prevention systems and by  putting in encryption 
and content filtering software [33, 38,  49].  These  measures  offer  a  technological  or 
technical  solution  to  the  problem,  but  by  no  means  reasonable  to  efficiently 
safeguard IS security threats completely [3, 30, 49, 50, 56, 73, 74]. So as to survive 
with increased  threats  and  to  effectively  protect  IS  assets,  non-technical  solutions 
such  IS  security  policies  have 
likewise  been  employed  [53].  Research  has 
established  the view that organisations and individuals who opt for  technical  as well 
as non-technical measures to protect  their IS assets are more likely to attain success 
in  safeguarding IS resources [47, 56, 65]. In IS literature  an innovation is referred as 
an  idea,  a  product,  a  process  or  a  technology  that  is  new  to  an  individual  or 
organisation [25, 27]. Hence, technical  and  non- technical IS security measures may 
collectively be  referred as IS security innovations. 

Although  both  technical and non-technical  IS  security  measures  are  important, 
several research had pinpointed behaviour of individual user within an organization 
as one element  of ambiguity in  securing  IS  assets  [5,  16,  56,  65].  With  all  the 
technical  and non-  technical IS  security  measures  at one’s  disposal,  efficient use 
cannot  be  realized  if  the  end  user  lacks  the  required  knowledge  and  skills  to 
adequately  apply  the  measures.  If  the  end-users  of  organisational  IS  does  not 
understand the importance of IS security practices and  are  not eager  to  accept the 
policies, then  those  safeguards  measures become ineffective [30]. Given  that the 
security attacks are increasingly widespread and  more  organized  than  ever,  it  is 
important to gauge the knowledge of users to detect and prevent such attacks. 

When an individual possesses the necessary knowledge about the effectiveness 
of  a  safeguard  measure  in  providing  protection  from  IS  threats,  that  individual is 
more  likely to adopt  preventive  behaviour  or  action  [38,  51,  68].  Chan  et al.  [10] 
stated that acquisition  of  knowledge  related  to  an  IS countermeasure builds one’s 
self-confidence  in  dealing  with  threats.  According  to  IS  literature,  computer  self- 
efficacy  is  the  term  that  relates  individual’s  self-  confidence  and  ability  to 
successfully use a computer or  IS to accomplish a  specific task  [4, 13]. Computer 
self-  efficacy have also been  cited as essential  in  determining  one’s  intention  to 
engage in current or future use of an  IS. 

Prior  research  on  IS  indicates  a  significant  positive 

relationship  between 
individual’s IS self-efficacy and the usage of ISs [60]. Also, individuals IS self-efficacy 
has found to be a significant determinant for IS security  adoption [30, 53, 66]. Eastin 
and  LaRose  [20]  state  that  self-efficacy  overcomes  the  fear  many  novice  users 
experience in an event of threat and enhances the ability  to  cope  with  any  attack. 
Arachchilage  and  Love  [4],  identified  self-efficacy  as  an  important  determinant  of 
the IS security threat avoidance behaviour and a key element in ensuring safeguard 
effectiveness. 

This  research  attempts  to  examine  the  role  of  an  individual’s  self-efficacy  in  IS 
security  innovation  adoption. To this end, the study reviewed past literature  on IS 
security to establish the relationship between self-  efficacy and  IS security adoption. 
The research makes  three main  contributions to  theory and practice.  First,  using  a 

review  of  IS  security  literature,  the  research  verifies the significance of examining 
the effect of  individual  self-efficacy on  IS  security adoption.  Secondly,  the  analysis 
carried  out  established  the  existing savvy of the role of individual self-efficacy for  IS 
security innovation adoption. Finally, the study  approves the significance of individual 
self-efficacy for  IS security innovation adoption. 

The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.  The ‘Theoretical Background’ 
section  illustrates  the  basics  of  self-efficacy  relating 
the 
subsequent section ‘Research Questions’, we presented 4 research questions for the 
study. The ‘Research  Methodology’ section, briefly discusses the method  employed 
to  examine  the  influence  of  the  relationship  between  self-efficacy  and  IS  security 
innovation  adoption. In Section 5,  we presented the result obtained  from  the  data 
analysis.  Finally,  in  Section  6,  we  discussed  the  finding  of  the  study  results,  in 
addition,  conclusion was also presented in Section 6.

2.  Theoretical Background 

The focus of IS security is to protect and safeguard  organization’s  IS  assets  from 
vulnerabilities  [1].  The  main  challenge  for  organization’s  IS  security  is  to  protect 
unauthorized access of information sources [21]  and to  defend computer resources 
against malicious  attacks. As a result, organizations allocate a substantial  amount of 
resources to safeguard their IS assets from IS  security threats [23]. 

Various  solutions  have  been  developed  in  response  to  IS  security  and  these 
solutions targets both technical  and non-technical problem areas [3, 5]. With all the 
IS  security  measures  at  one’s  disposal,  the  efficient  use  cannot  be  realised  if  the 
end  user  lacks  the required knowledge and skills to adequately apply the measures. 
Banu  and  Banu  [8]  indicated  that  IS  security  attacks  over  the  internet  are 
successful  because  of  many inexperienced and unsophisticated users. Additionally, 
social  engineering  attacks  are  now  much  more  concealed as such naive users are 
more inclined to  incautiously divulge  passwords  and other  sensitive  and  classified 
information.  Lack  of awareness  of the  users  regarding the maliciousness of crimes 
over the internet  in effect has opened a fertile ground for cyber-criminals  to conduct 
IS security attacks. Even in the present-day, a number of users are ignorant that their 
personal  information is actively  being targeted by  cyber-  criminals. Given that  the 
security  attacks  are  increasingly widespread  and more organized than  ever,  it  is 
important  to  develop  the  knowledge  of  users  to  detect and prevent such attacks. 
According  to  Rogers  [51],  when  individuals  possess  the  requisite  knowledge 
about  the  effectiveness  of  mechanisms that provide protection  from a threat, they 
are more likely to adopt that measure. In other words, a person who is knowledgeable 
about IS security is more likely to assess IS security risks and accordingly  employs 
security innovations effectively to address  those risks [41]. Individual’s knowledge 
has a co- relation  to one’s  self-efficacy to perform  a  behaviour  [3]. 

Bandura [7] defined self-efficacy as the judgment of  one’s  ability  to  organize  and 
execute  given  types  of  performance. Hence, in the context of this research, self- 
efficacy is referred as a belief in one’s ability to thwart  IS security threats and one’s 
capability to safeguard  IS  assets  from  IS  security  attacks.  Tamjidyamcholo  et  al. 
[59] noted that a high level of self-efficacy in a person  will make  them  much more 
self-assured  about  their  abilities  and  strengthens  their  motivation.  Hence,  when 
users are knowledgeable about IS security threats, they  have  more self-confidence 
to take relevant  actions  to  thwart attack by adopting preventive behaviour. 

 
 
Researchers  often  utilised  Bandura  [7]’s  theory  of  self-  efficacy  to  measure 
individual’s  self-confidence.  The  fundamental of this theory is in understanding the 
relationship  between  one’s  belief  and  one’s  willingness  to  engage  in  behaviours 
necessary  to  successfully  accomplish a task. The theory also explains the process 
an individual experience as he or she encounters a new  challenge together with the 
judgments, evaluations, and  appraisals made based on the knowledge learnt [6]. 

3.  Research Questions 

This  paper  considered  the  existing  IS  security  literature 

to  determine  the 
importance  of  individual  self-efficacy  for  IS  security  innovation  a d o p t i o n .  The 
analysis focused speciﬁcally on  investigating, the following  research questions: 

RQ1: What are the demographics of the extant studies  of  individual self-efficacy on 
IS  security  innovation  adoption including the year of study, sample groups, sample 
size, countries? 

RQ2:  What  are  the  theoretical  foundation  used  in  the  existing studies of individual 
self-efficacy on IS security  innovation adoption? 

RQ3:  Is  there  a  difference  in  investigating  individual  self-efficacy for different types 
of security innovations?   

RQ4:  What  are  the  results  of  the  studies  that  examine  the  relationship  between 
individual self-efficacy and IS  security innovation? 

4.  Research Methodology 

A ﬁnding of an individual study is not sufﬁcient to  generalise on a particular issue, 
while to reach an overall  outcome,  ﬁndings  of  a  number  of  independent  studies  on 
a  subject  can  be  combined  [24].  A  technique  known  as  a  Systematic  Literature 
Review (SLR)  may be used  to identify, analyse and interpret all available evidence 
related to a speciﬁc research question [27]. To meet our  research  objectives  and to 
address the research questions, we carried out a SLR to study the role of self- efficacy 
for  IS  security  innovation  adoption.  SLR  improves  the  likelihood  of  generating  a 
clearer, more objective answer to the research questions. As SLRs considers study 
design (sampling strategy and data collection methods), data and analytical methods 
used, the reviews are effective at gauging the robustness of evidence. The use of 
SLR  procedure  enabled  the  study  to  obtain  an  overall  conclusion  regarding  the 
relationships between  individual self-efficacy and IS security adoption. 

To  ensure  a  thorough  coverage  of  academic  articles  related  to  IS  security 
adoption,  we  conducted  an  extensive literature search of IS Journals using Google 
Scholar  and  multiple  large-scale  and  reputable  digital  libraries  and  databases 
including  Web  of  Science,  IEEE  Xplore,  Science  Direct  (Elsevier),  ACM  Digital 
Library,  Wiley  Online  Library,  ProQuest,  EBSCO,  Springer  LINK  and  Emerald 
Management  Xtra.  These  sources  contain  ample  high-quality  journal  articles  and 
conference  papers.  The  search  focused  only  on  peer-  reviewed  journal  and 
conference articles. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To determine which  of the articles  were really  relevant to the research objectives 
the study established,  an  inclusion  and  exclusion  conditions.  The  study  selection 
criteria for the SLR were: (C1) it should be an  empirical study on IS security adoption, 
(C2) the study  should examine individual self-efficacy as a dependent  variable, and 
finally, (C3) the study examines the relationship between individual self-efficacy and 
IS  security innovation adoption. 

The initial search yielded 544 citations by following  inclusion and exclusion criterion 
C1. To accomplish the  inclusion and exclusion criterion C2, the abstracts of all  544 
were  manually  scanned  to  identify  if  the  articles  examine  individual self-efficacy.  
Number of articles identified as potentially relevant were 112. By applying  inclusion 
and  exclusion  criterion  C3  for  these  112  articles,  39 articles  with  42  studies  were 
found eligible  for  the  SLR.  The  42  studies  that  meet  all  3  criteria  examined  the 
effect  of individual  self-efficacy for  the  adoption of IS security innovations. 

5.  Results 

We conducted a statistical analysis using frequencies and percentages to combine 
and summarize the variables collected. 

5.1.  Distribution of Studies by Year 

Table 1 shows the literature distribution by publication year of the studies. Data from 
the SLR shows that self-  efficacy  has been considered in the IS security  innovation 
adoption literature since 2004.

The  academic  discussion  of  individual  self-efficacy  on  IS  security  adoption  has 
mostly taken place during the  last 12 to 14 years. Table 1 shows that the number 
of articles over time has increased and during this period,  the topic has increasingly 
attracted among the scholarly researchers. The distribution of studies by publication 
year  suggests  that  examining  individual  self-efficacy  for 
IS  security  innovation 
adoption  is  an  increasingly  emerging discourse. Also, SLR confirms that individual 
self-efficacy for  IS  security innovation  adoption  is  still  an  active  IS  tract,  as  there 
were 6 articles published in  the year 2016.

Table 2 illustrates the number of studies that employ  different sample groups in the 
studies  to  examine  individual  self-efficacy  for  IS  security  innovation  adoption. 
Results  suggest  that  the  majority  of  studies  conducted  their  studies  by  engaging 
individuals  by  adopting  convenience  sampling  or  by  using  student  subjects.  The 
analysis also helped explain RQ1. 

5.3.  Distribution of Sample size in the studies 

SLR analysed sample size of the reviewed studies to further elucidate RQ1. Among 
the 42 studies considered in the SLR, 40 studies utilised survey methodology. In  this 
40 studies, a total of 13841 participants was  included, with an average sample size 
of 346. Table 3 showed that the study employing smallest and largest  sample were 
77  and  988  participants, respectively.  Approximately, 67% (two third) of the studies 
use more  than 200 participants in their assessment.

1.1.  Theories Used in the Reviewed Studies 

In  response  to  RQ2,  we  analysed  the  theoretical  foundation  for each reviewed 
IS  security 
literature.  To  examine  the  relationship  between  self-efficacy  and 
innovation adoption, reviewed studies used a number of  different  theories.  Table  5 
shows  the  different theoretical model exploited in the reviewed studies. 

PMT  is  the  most  widely  used  theory  to  determine  the  relationship  between self-
efficacy  and  IS  security  adoption.  More  than  half  of  the  reviewed  studies  used 
PMT or PMT integrated with other theories. Reviewed  literature suggests that apart 
from  PMT,  the  Theory  of  Planned  Behaviour  (TPB),  Theory of  Reasoned  Action 
(TRA) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) are among the most widely used theories 
in examining self-efficacy  on IS security innovation adoption. 

1.2.  Types of Innovation 

According to the classification of Zmud [71] we defined  the  type  of  innovation  as 
process and product. For this  study, process innovation involves establishing a new 
system,  method  or  policies  that  changes  the  IS  security  operational  processes, 
whereas  product  innovation  are  new  products introduced to  enhance IS security. 
Different factors determine the adoption of process and  product innovation and the 
extent to which these factors  impact  on the adoption process  [61].

We differentiate the reviewed studies into two sets of process and product innovation 
and  examine some demographics  including  sample size,  sample groups  for  each 
group of the  studies. Also, we examine if there is any difference in  the application 
of theories for  the studies  that  examine  process and product innovations. Table 6 
highlights  the  difference  in  study  practices  for  process  and  product  security 
innovations. The result of this analysis would  address to RQ3. 
Also,  it  is  evident  from  the  results  that  most  of  IS  security  process  innovation 
studies  utilises  individuals  as  a  subject,  whereas,  most  of  IS  security  product 
innovation studies employs student participants.

As  for the  theories  used for two  groups  of  studies, process innovation studies tend 
to combine PMT with  the theoretical basis of either TRA, SCT or Deterrence  Theory 
(DT)  compared  to  studies  examining  product  innovations. 

5.7. Significance 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
independent  and  dependent  variables  is  usually 
The  relationship  between 
evaluated  in  term  of  ‘test  of  significance’,  highlighting  their  relationship  [25,  26]. 
‘Test of significance’ and various other ‘effect sizes’  such as correlation co-efficient 
provided by quantitative  studies can be aggregated to find an overall outcome [27]. 
Effect size when considered in terms of  significance is frequently referred as weak, 
moderate or  strong significance [24]. Hunter et al. [32] and Hameed and Counsell 
[25],  however,  suggested  that  aggregation  of  ‘test  of  significance’  results  from 
different studies could produce a misleading outcome. This is because,  there is no 
rule  for  determining the value of the  correlation that interprets as weak, moderate 
or strong  significance. 
For  the  study,  we  extracted  from  the reviewed  studies  the  correlation  co-efficient 
values of the relationship between self-efficacy and IS security innovation  adoption. 
We  interpreted  the  correlation  co-efficient  values  under  a  single  classification  to 
obtain the test of significance for our assessment. We  adopted  the  correlation value 
referred  by Hameed  and  Counsell  [24]  and  Hameed  and  Counsell  [26],  which 
categorises:  a  correlation value between 0 and ±0.09 as insignificant, 
±0.10 and ±0.29 as weak significance, ±0.30 and ±0.49  as  moderate  significance, 
±  0.5  and  ±  0.69  as  strong  significance,  ±0.70  and  ±0.89  as  the  very  strong 
significance and ±0.9 and ±1.0 near perfect. Based on 
the  above  classification  we  coded  the  correlation  co-  efficient of individual studies 
and aggregated resulting  tests of significance to obtain the overall assessment of the 
relationship  between  self-efficacy  and  IS  security  innovation adoption. 
Among  the  42 studies  considered  in  the  SLR,  35  studies  provided  correlation  co-
efficient  for  the  relationship  between  individual  self-efficacy  and  IS  security 
innovation  adoption.  Table  7  summarizes  the  results  of  an  aggregated  test  of 
significance for the relationship between self-efficacy and the adoption of IS security 
innovation.

6. Discussion and Conclusion 

This  SLR  aimed  to  understand  the  role  of  individual  self-efficacy  on  IS  security 
innovation  adoption.  The  results  highlighted  that  individual  self-efficacy  is  a 
significant  attribute  of  IS  security  innovation  adoption.  The  S L R   results  of  th e  
distr ibution  o f  s tu d ie s  by publication year suggest that researchers have started 

 
 
 
examining  the  effect  of  individual  self-efficacy  on  IS  security  innovation  adoption 
since  2004.  This  is  the  period  where online social media and social  networking 
became  a  mainstream  concept  with  the  launching  of  Facebook on February 2004. 
These social media emerge  as   a   target   for    scams; exposing   individual   and 
organisational  d a t a   a t   r is k .    More  p e o p le   p u t  t h e i r   personal  information

online, 

offering a 

huge  opportunity  for cyber criminals  to  exploit.  
Thus, IS  security  innovation  adoption  has  speedily  been  under  scrutiny  since  the 
rise of social media and researcher  started examining individual self-efficacy as one 
of the  key predictors for IS security innovation adoption. 
Studies  that  examined  the  influence  of  individual  self-  efficacy  for  IS  security 
innovation  adoption  has  explored  for  different  sample  groups.  The  SLR  findings 
showed  that  the  research  on  the  relationship  between  individual  self-efficacy  and 
IS security innovation  adoption based their studies on convenience samples of  both 
students  and  non-students.  The  findings  indicate  that  approximately  half  of  the 
reviewed literature used  student  subjects. Using  student  subjects  for experimental 
research as a substitute for another group has been widely criticised for having little 
external  validity  and  generalisability.  The  ethical  concerns  of  student  participation 
revolve  mainly  around  the  issue  whether  the  participant  serve  with  their  own 
consent.  Also,  it has been  argued that student samples are  fundamentally biased 
in age, experience, and intellectual ability. However, the studies reviewed in the SLR 
provided  no justification  for  their  chosen  subject  sample nor did acknowledge any 
limitations for the use of a student sample. Hence, the effect of individual self- efficacy 
for IT security innovation adoption bears no significance for the difference in sample 
groups. 
The  results  of  SLR  showed  that  the  average  sample  size  of  the  studies  is 
approximately 350 participants. A study  that  has a  sample size which  is too small 
may have an unrealistic chance of yielding a useful information. Larger sample sizes 
have the obvious advantage of  providing  more  data  for  researchers  to  work  with 
and  provide  more  accurate  mean  values  and  a  smaller  margin  of  error.  Thus  an 
appropriate determination of the sample size used in a study is a crucial step in the 
design of a study. The sample size used in the majority  of the studies reviewed in 
the  SLR  deemed  appropriate.  This  commends  of  the  soundness  of  the  selected 
studies  for  the  SLR.  In  addition,  it  provides  evidence  on  the  correctness  of  the 
results  of  the  reviewed  studies  that  examine  the  relationship between individual 
self-  efficacy and IT security innovation adoption. 
In  order  to  identify  if  culture  moderates  the relationship  between  individual  self-
efficacy and IS security  innovation adoption,  we explored the distribution of country 
of the reviewed studies in the SLR.  Deans et al.  [18] states that culture influences 
usage of IT in different countries. In a meta-analysis of TAM, Schepers and Wetzels 
[52] used western and non-western as a moderating factor in the context of culture. 
They divide  the  studies  conducted  in  Europe,  North  America,  Australia and New 
Zealand as western and the rest of  world  as  non-western.  The  SLR  represents  a 
diverse  culture which belongs to both western and non-western  groups. Hence, the 
SLR indicates that the overall results of existing literature that considers the influence 
of  individual self-efficacy  for IS  security  innovation  adoption is not biased towards 
one particular culture. 
The  SLR  also  explored  the  theoretical  foundation exploited  in  examining individual 
self-efficacy for  IS  security innovation adoption  by the reviewed studies.  The result 
of the SLR identified PMT as the principal model. In a meta-analysis study, Floyd et 
al.  [22]  described PMT as one of the most powerful explanatory  theories  predicting 

 
individual intentions to adopt  safeguard  measures.  PMT  is  useful  in  analysing  and 
exploring recommended actions or behaviours to avert  the consequences of threats 
such as IS security attacks.  Apart from PMT, SLR identified SCT, TRA, and TPB as 
other models utilised in examining the effect of  individual self-efficacy  for IS  security 
innovation  adoption.  SCT [7] posits that one’s conﬁdence in their  ability to  perform 
it  a  behaviour  successfully  will  produce positive valued outcomes. The main tenet in 
the  TRA  is  that  an  individual’s  behavioural  intention  in  a  specific context depends 
on attitude toward performing  the target behaviour and on subjective norm. The TRA 
holds that the practical impact of subjective norm on the  behavioural intention is that 
an individual may choose  to perform a specific behaviour, even though it may not  be 
favourable  to  him  or  her  to  do  so  [64].  TPB  is  an  extension  of  TRA  at  the  same 
time adopt the efﬁcacy expectancies of SCT into consideration. 
In  this  study,  we  identified  if  there  is  a  difference  in  investigating individual self-
efficacy for different types of security innovations. In order to analyse, we categorised 
IS  security  innovations  as  product  and  process to access the scenario. The results 
show that the  average  sample  size  used  for  IS  security  process  innovation studies 
(373 participants) is higher  than  the  product  innovation  studies  (271  participants). 
One  explanation  is  that  process  innovation  involves  replacing the entire system or 
work  procedure,  whereas  product  innovation  does  not  involve  change of  an  entire 
system. Also, it is evident from the results that most of IS security process innovation 
studies  utilises  individuals  as  subjects,  whereas  most  of  IS  security  product 
innovation studies employ students. One probable explanation could be that process 
innovation  such IS security policies are mostly adopted in an  organisational setting 
for which the sample subjects  would most probably be non-students. 
Finally,  the  SLR  analysed  the  correlation  co-efficient  for the relationship between 
individual self-efficacy and  IS security adoption behaviour to aggregate the tests of 
significance of the reviewed studies. In terms of the  percentage, 92% of the studies 
found self-efficacy as  significant (correlation value between ±0.10 to ±1.00) attribute 
in  IS  security  innovation  adoption.  Also,  approximately  71%  of  the  studies  we 
considered  verified  the  association  between self-efficacy  and  IS  security adoption 
as  moderate  significance  (correlation  value  between  ±0.30  to  ±0.49)  or  strong 
significance  (correlation  value  between  ±0.50  to  ±0.69).  Hedges  and  Olkin  [31], 
Hameed and Counsell [24] and Hameed and Counsell [26] suggested that it would be 
within reason  for  a  study  to  consider  an  established  relationship  to  exist  between 
two  variables  when  a  majority  of  prior  studies  had  found  statistically  signiﬁcant 
results. Hence,  results  of  aggregated  tests  of  signiﬁcance  indicate  that  individual 
self-efficacy is an important predictor of IS  security innovation adoption. 
This study offers several contributions to the IS security management literature.  The 
study  contributes to  the field  of  IS  security  by  empirically  endorsing  the  influence 
of  individual  self-efficacy  for  IS  security  innovation  adoption.  Additionally,  to 
recognise  the  current understanding of the subject,  we gathered almost  all  their 
existing  studies  that  examine  individual’s  self-  efficacy  for  IS  security innovation 
adoption. 
The  most  important  theoretical  implication  is  that  this  study  using  SLR  verifies  the 
significance  of  self-  efficacy  for  IS  security  innovation  adoption.  Another  key 
implication of this study is the importance of  spreading IS security knowledge among 
the users for  safeguarding IS assets. On one hand, knowledge has a  simple positive 
effect on self-efficacy, which affects the  individual’s security behaviour. On  the other 
hand,  knowledge allows users to assess a security technology  fairly and improve the 

quality of decision making. IS  security literature has emphasised on the need to pay 
attention  to  security  education,  awareness  and  training  initiatives and interventions. 
Therefore,  we suggest  that  organizations create appropriate education, training and 
security awareness programs that ensure employees possesses up-to-date knowledge 
of IS security as well as  facilitate  conditions  that  will  improve  their  individual  self-
efficacy  regards  IS  threats.  This  study has  certain limitations. The major limitation of 
this analysis was the  inadequacy  of  studies  that  examined  individual  self-  efficacy 
on IS security innovation adoption. The result  of the SLR would be more accurate and 
better explained  if analysed with more studies.
