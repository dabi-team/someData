I. INTRODUCTION

D ISTRIBUTION System State Estimation (DSSE) is the

process of inferring the values of system’s state variables
using a limited number of measured data at certain locations
in the system [1]. Thus, DSSE is basically a numerical process
to map data measurements to state variables. While State
Estimation (SE) is a well-developed and widely-used concept
in transmission systems, its use at the distribution level is still
the subject of active research. In recent years we have observed
the rapid growth of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)
in electric distribution systems (e.g., according to [2], the
number of advanced meters in the U.S. was estimated to
be 64.7 million devices in 2015, out of a total number of
150.8 million meters, indicating a penetration rate of 42.9%.)
Hence, DSSE is expected to become a signiﬁcant function
in monitoring and power management of smart grids [3].
A general schematic of DSSE function is shown in Fig. 1.
Extending conventional SE approaches to active distribution
systems is a challenging task due to several factors that are
based on the considerable differences between the transmission
and distribution systems:

• Observability problem: Unlike transmission systems,
the distribution systems are highly unobservable, meaning

that the number of metering instruments in a network is
generally small compared to the huge size of the system
[4].

• Low x/r value: In distribution systems, we generally
face low x/r levels, which render the conventional DC
SE techniques in transmission systems unusable at the
distribution level [5].

• Unbalanced operation: Distribution systems are in prac-
tice highly unbalanced which leads to a higher level of
complexity in SE problem formulation.

• Communication issues: Constraints on the communica-
tion system, such as the network bandwidth and capacity
also limit the accuracy and rate of data exchange [6].
• Network conﬁguration problem: Considering the huge
size of the distribution network and noting that
the
complete data related to the topology of this network is
not commonly stored an additional degree of complexity
to DSSE in these networks [7].

• Renewable energy integration: The higher penetration
of renewable power resources introduces a higher level of
uncertainty in distribution system operation and DSSE.
• Cyber-security issues: The issue of cyber-security is
a new concern in management and control of active
distribution systems.

Despite these challenges, industrial interest in implementing

DSSE is growing. Electrical energy ﬁrms such as Eaton [8],
Survalent [9], ETAP [10], OSI [11], and Nexant [12] have re-
cently devised industrial programs for promoting system mon-
itoring and management at the distribution level for utilities
using DSSE. A discussion on relevant experiences on DSSE
for radial distribution networks is presented in [13], where
the connections between SE implementation and practical
variables, such as line lengths, switch ﬂows, voltage regulation,
and measurement areas, are elaborated. In this paper we seek
to present an extensive review of the proposed solutions to
different DSSE-related problems. While the main focus of
this paper is DSSE, certain works on transmission system SE
have also been cited and reviewed where they become relevant.
In summary, this paper discusses the following issues: DSSE
problem formulation, pseudo-measurement generation, uncer-
tain network topology,
integration of renewable resources,
meter placement, and DSSE cyber-security. Special attention
has been given to data-driven and machine-learning-based
approaches that are gaining interest to address different types
of problems [14].

The reviewed works address critical aspects of DSSE shown
in Fig. 1: 1) DSSE solver module: in Sections II and III, we
summarize the fundamentals of DSSE, with respect to choice
of algorithm and state variables. 2) Pseudo-measurement gen-
eration module: in Section IV the challenge of observability in
distribution systems and proposed pseudo-measurement gen-
eration solutions in the literature are elaborated. 3) Topology
identiﬁcation module: Section V reviews the past works related
to online conﬁguration tracking, connectivity detection, and
topology discovery, which are pre-requisites for obtaining ac-
curate DSSE solutions. 4) Feeder and instrumentation module:
The measurement units distributed across the electric power
system are the main sources of the information for running the
monitoring and control systems. In Section VI, the problem
of optimal meter placement and potential PMU applications
in distribution feeders is presented in terms of practical con-
straints and objective functions. Modern distribution feeders
can have high penetration levels of distributed renewable
resources. The impacts of penetration of renewable energy
resources in distribution feeders on DSSE are analyzed in Sec-
tion VII. 5) Cyber-security module: Reliable DSSE depends on
detection and prevention of cyber-intrusions and cyber-attacks.
The challenge of cyber-security when performing wide-scale
distribution system measurement and monitoring is discussed
in Section VIII. Furthermore, conclusions and future research
directions are provided in Sections IX and X.

II. FUNDAMENTALS OF SE

A) Conventional Approach: Given a measurement vector
zzz (with size m × 1), and a measurement function hhh, which
connects the true state vector xxx (with size n × 1) to the
measurement vector (i.e., zzz = h(x)h(x)h(x) + eee, with eee denoting the
measurement error vector), the state estimation problem can
be formulated as a Weighted Least Square (WLS) optimization
problem (with bold letters denoting vectors/matrices) [1]:

2

1 , ..., σ−2

where ˆxˆxˆx is the estimated state vector, T is the matrix transpo-
sition operation, and WWW denotes the weight matrix that rep-
resents the user’s conﬁdence in the measured data. A widely-
used choice for the weight matrix is WWW = diag{σ−2
m },
where σ2
j represents the variance of the measurement error
corresponding to the jth element of zzz. This choice of the
weight matrix is based on two assumptions: 1) the error vector
(eee) has a Gaussian distribution with zero mean, and 2) the
measurement errors of different elements of the measurement
vector are statistically independent. Under these assumptions
the WLS problem transforms to the maximum likelihood
estimation. A number of papers have deviated from the
conventional approach towards selecting WWW . For instance, in
[15], using active/reactive power data history, non-diagonal
terms have been added to the weight matrix to obtain better
WLS accuracy, by modeling the existing correlation between
the different measurement samples. This problem has been
analyzed in details in [16] for modeling the correlations in
measurement error distributions of different variables that are
measured by the same device (smart meters and PMUs.) For
instance, it is shown that the non-diagonal covariance terms
between different variables measured by the same device are
as follows (notation: active power (P ), reactive power (Q),
voltage magnitude (V ), current magnitude (I), power factor
(cos Φ)):

σV,P = σ2

(σ2

σV,Q = σ2

V I sin Φ
ΦI 2V 2 sin 2Φ + σ2

V I 2 sin 2Φ − σ2

I V 2 sin 2Φ)

(2)

Through another approach, in [17] and [18], the elements
of the diagonal WWW matrix are updated using a weight function
during solution iterations to obtain robustness against bad
data. The proposed weight updating mechanism for the ith
measurement to obtain new weight value ( ¯wi) is as follows:

¯wi =

, D(cid:48)






σ−2
i
σ−2
i ζi,
0, D(cid:48)

i > k1

i ≤ k0
k0 < D(cid:48)

i ≤ k0

(3)

where, D(cid:48)
i, ζi k0, and k1 are parameters deﬁned based on the
residual level corresponding to the ith data sample. The idea
behind (3) is that as D(cid:48)
i (which is a measure of low quality
of the measured data sample) increases beyond the introduced
thresholds (k0 and k1), the weight value assigned to it should
decrease (with factor ζi), reducing the inﬂuence of unreliable
or bad data samples on the outcome of the WLS.

Conventionally, Gauss-Newton method has been applied to
iteratively solve the WLS problem (1) [5]. This algorithm
basically ﬁnds a solution to the equation ∇J = 0, where J
denotes the objective function of optimization problem (1).
The update rules of the algorithm at the kth iteration are as
follows:

HHH(xxx(k)) =

∂J
∂xxx(k)

GGG(k) = HHH(xxx(k))T WWWHHH(xxx(k))

(1)

∆xxx(k) = GGG(k)−1HHH(xxx(k))T WWW (zzz − hhh(xxx(k)))

xxx(k + 1) = xxx(k) + ∆xxx(k)

(7)

where, HHH is the Jacobian of J with respect
to the state
variables, and GGG is the system gain matrix. Other algorithms,
such as back tracking method, trust region method, and quasi-
Newton techniques, have also been applied instead of the
classical Gauss-Newton method, to obtain better convergence
properties [19]. Noting the non-convexity of (1) and the
sensitivity of Newton method to initial conditions and gain
matrix ill-conditioning,
in [20] and [21], a Semi-Deﬁnite
Programming (SDP) approach is proposed to ﬁnd a good initial
guess for the Newton method. The SDP formulation is based
on the convex relaxation of the original WLS problem, which
also guarantees the existence of a unique global solution.
The computational efﬁciency of SDP is shown to be superior
compared to that of the original non-convex problem. To
further improve the computational performance of SDP-based
SE, distributed algorithms have been employed for obtaining
a solution [22].

Another modiﬁcation in the structure of WLS (1) is the
inclusion of virtual measurements as equality constraints
c(x) = 000). Virtual measurements represent operator’s perfect
c(x)
(c(x)
information on certain aspects of system operation (e.g., zero-
power-injection at nodes without customers.) Lagrange multi-
pliers (λλλ) have been proposed as penalty factors for enforcing
these equality constraints [23]. The modiﬁed WLS objective
function is deﬁned as follows:

{ˆx, ˆλˆx, ˆλˆx, ˆλ} = arg min

(zzz − h(x)h(x)h(x))T WWW (zzz − h(x)h(x)h(x)) + λλλT c(x)
c(x)
c(x)

(8)

xxx,λλλ

Given the above objective function, the state update step in

the Gauss-Newton method (6) is changed to:

(cid:21)
(cid:20)∆xxx(k)

where, C(x)C(x)C(x) = ∂c(x)
c(x)
∂xxx .

B) Alternative DSSE Structures: While WLS represents the
conventional SE in power systems, alternative mathematical
formulations have been proposed for the purpose of increasing
the robustness of the state estimator when facing bad data.
Noting the susceptibility of WLS to bad data, in [24], the
use of Least Median of Squares (LMS) and Least Trimmed
Squares (LTS) is studied, which shows improved behavior
in handling outliers. Also, [25] investigates the use of Least
Absolute Value (LAV) estimator, which has the property of
automatic bad data rejection. Increasing the robustness of SE
has also been promoted by using a Generalized Maximum-
likelihood (GM) estimator instead of WLS in [26], where
normalized residuals (rn) are used through a convex score
functions (denoted as ρ(.)) in formulating the objective func-
tion. The SE formulation for these different approaches (in-
cluding pros and cons) are shown in Table I, in terms of the
objective function in optimization problem (1). In this table,
the residuals rrr = [r1, ..., rm]T are deﬁned as ri = zi − hi(xxx).
Also, med{} and r(i) deﬁne the set median and the ith
order statistics, respectively. Numerical comparisons of these
alternative DSSE formulations in terms of robustness against
system parameter uncertainties are presented in [27].

Other approaches towards structuring the DSSE have been
presented as well. For instance, some works in the litera-
ture tend to propose estimators which relax the Gaussian
uncertainty assumption inherent to WLS. This is of practical
importance given that this assumption is shown, through ﬁeld
tests, to be largely inaccurate [28]. Using Mean Squared Es-
timator (MSE) an analytic SE formulation is obtained in [29]
which does not depend on Gaussian uncertainty assumptions
and is capable of bad data measurement detection. A similar
estimator is used in [30], where a Bayesian alternative to
WLS is proposed. It is shown that the Bayesian approach has
speciﬁcally better performance in presence of non-Gaussian
uncertainty. Unlike WLS (equation (1)), the Bayesian approach
tends to estimate states as a conditional averaging operation:
(cid:90)

ˆxˆxˆx = E{xxx|zzz} =

αααfααα|zzz(ααα|zzz)dααα

(10)

Calculating E{xxx|zzz} depends on our knowledge of the
distribution function fxxx|zzz, which can be obtained using Bayes
rule, the measurement functions, and statistical properties of
the system. Citing availability of accurate knowledge of second
order statistics as a shortcoming of MSE-based methods,
in [31] an alternative DSSE formulation is presented as a
matrix completion problem which can be efﬁciently solved
for billions of entries. Using information-theoretic reasoning
it is shown that the optimal performance of DSSE is bounded
by the capacity of AMI communication channels in charge of
transmitting measurement samples to system operator.

To reduce the size of the optimization problem and speed up
the convergence of WLS for large-scale feeders, in [32], the
concept of quasi-symmetric impedance matrix is employed.
This is achieved by adding the following constraint to the
conventional WLS:

(zzz − h(x)h(x)h(x))T WWW (zzz − h(x)h(x)h(x))

g0(x) = xxx − x0x0x0 − T RXT RXT RX · I(x)
g0(x)
I(x) = 0
s.t. g0(x)

(11)

where, xxx and x0x0x0 represent the voltage node state vector and
the substation voltage, respectively. T RX denotes the reduced
impedance matrix and III is the set of nodal current injections.

III. DSSE PROBLEM FORMULATION

Due to the basic differences between transmission and
distribution systems, the DSSE problem formulation can have
major deviations from the conventional SE. The main point
of difference is the modeling of measurement function (hhh)
in DSSE, as this function reﬂects the power ﬂow equations
in the power system. Hence, based on the choice of state and
measured variables, choice of AC versus DC Power Flow (PF),
and the representation of phases in power ﬂow equations (for
application in unbalanced systems), the measurement function
can have different forms. In this section, we review the two
basic formulations of DSSE (in terms of choice of state
variables and measurement function) provided in the literature.
A) Voltage-Based DSSE: Traditionally, bus voltage magni-
tude and phase angle values have been used as state variables
in transmission systems [1]. This conventional approach has
also been employed in DSSE [33] [34] [35] [36].

B) Branch-Current-Based SE (BCSE): A notable group of
works, have adopted branch current as state variables, which
turns out to be a more natural way of DSSE formulation for
distribution systems [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42]. A summary
of the properties of different DSSE formulations is shown in
Table II.

IV. DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OBSERVABILITY

“Observability” refers to the system operator’s ability to
solve the state estimation problem. This depends on the num-
ber and location of metering instruments in the power system.
Also, the availability and quality of critical measurement data
samples in real-time has a crucial impact on power system
observability. Conventionally, numerical and topological meth-
ods have been used to assess the observability of transmission
systems with respect to the number and location of meters,
as demonstrated in [1]. Alternative observability assessment
procedures have been employed at distribution level. For
instance, in [43] a probabilistic approach is adopted to deﬁne
an Unobservability Index (UI) as follows:

U I =

n
(cid:88)

i=1

Ki =

n
(cid:88)
(

Bi(cid:88)

i=1

j=1

−p(bi,j) log2 p(bi,j))

(12)

where, Ki denotes the entropy of the ith state (with p(bi,j)
deﬁning the probability of the jth bin for the ith state.)
Basically, UI represents our overall uncertainty on the dis-
tribution system state variable values. As another example, a
graph-theoretic criterion for local observability assessment of
distribution networks is obtained in [4].

Unlike transmission systems that enjoy a high level of
data redundancy, the distribution systems are generally under-
determined with poor observability. Thus, the accuracy of
DSSE can be highly affected by the quality and availabil-
ity of sensor data. The distribution system can easily be-
come unobservable in case of communication failure/delays.
Hence, bad/missing measurement data is closely connected
to measurement redundancy and preserving the reliability of
the DSSE problem. “Bad” data refer to data measurements
that have considerable deviation from the underlying actual

4

behavior, due to meter malfunction and communication noise.
Missing data can also be treated as a special case of bad data.
Conventionally, at the transmission level, bad data detection
has been performed by inspecting the normalized measurement
residuals. However, this method is subject to failure and com-
plications in case of insufﬁcient measurement redundancy and
multiple sources of bad data [1]. Hence, alternative approaches
have been employed to address this problem, along with the
sub-problem of missing data, at the distribution level (refer to
Section II.)

Hence, to improve the observability of distribution systems,
the input measurement set needs to be artiﬁcially augmented
(to compensate for missing data) or corrected (to compensate
for bad data.) This can be done through employing “pseudo-
measurement” samples, which are artiﬁcially-generated data-
points (e.g., active/reactive power, voltage and current, etc.)
based on the data history of the distribution systems [5]. A
basic approach is to use standard load proﬁles for generating
pseudo-measurements [44]. Given that these data-points are
not highly accurate, they introduce high variance levels in the
weight matrix (WWW ), which could even lead to ill-conditioning
of the DSSE problem. Data-driven approaches are employed
for generating pseudo-measurements and handling their un-
certainty, including probabilistic and statistical analysis, and
machine-learning-based techniques.

A) Probabilistic and Statistical Approaches: Methods based
on probabilistic and statistical techniques, which employ spa-
tial/temporal correlation and historic probability distribution
data, are widely used for generating reasonable pseudo-
measurements and assessing their uncertainty. This includes
empirical studies [45], Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and
Expectation Maximization (EM) [46] [47], time-varying vari-
ance and mean modeling [44], correlation analysis (between
total and individual consumption) [48], nodal active-reactive
correlation analysis [15], internodal and intranodal correlation
modeling [16], intertemporal correlation analysis [6], multi-
variate complex Gaussian modeling [49], and constrained
optimization [50].

B) Learning-Based Approaches: Machine learning algo-
rithms have also attracted scientiﬁc attention in solving DSSE
problems, including addressing the problem of active/reactive
power pseudo-measurement generation and uncertainty assess-
ment. Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) [51], Artiﬁcial
Neural Network (ANN) [52], clustering algorithms [53], Paral-
lel Distributed Processing networks (PDP) [17], and Nonlinear
Auto-Regressive eXogenous (NARX) [18].

A summary of the notable papers in these two categories
are shown in Table III. Pseudo-measurement generation is
basically a special type of load estimation at distribution level.
While there is a considerable number of works done in this
area, still unanswered questions remain. For instance, most
of the papers, instead of using real AMI data history, rely
on standard load proﬁles to perform numerical analysis and
veriﬁcation. Also, the huge amount of data in practice can
cause certain learning methods to become computationally
expensive. Managing this “big data” challenge in distribution
systems requires further research and studies.

V. NETWORK TOPOLOGY AND CONFIGURATION

The topology identiﬁcation problem can be categorized into

two separate, yet related, subproblems:

A) System conﬁguration identiﬁcation: The basic assump-
tion within this set of problems is that the basic topology of
the network is known to the system operator. However, due
to local events (such as faults, line disconnections, switching
events, etc.) the basic topology will undergo local changes over
time. Limited knowledge of the operator on these changes will
affect the accuracy of SE solutions. Hence, the objective is to
use the system-wide measurements to update our knowledge
of system conﬁguration to avoid topology errors (i.e., state
of switches, fuses,
lines, DG/customer connection status.)
Conventionally, generalized SE models have been used at the
transmission level (with switch-related variables added to the
SE formulation) to detect and correct topological errors [1]
[54]. Similar classic methods have been applied to DSSE as
well [55] [56]. Apart from the classical approaches, other
probabilistic and data-driven methods have been applied for
topology detection and identiﬁcation in distribution systems.
These methods are usually based on a data-driven search
process in a limited topology space (i.e., topology library)
deﬁned by variations on the basic topology, as shown in
Fig. 2. Probabilistic recursive Bayesian approach [7] [57],
fuzzy-based pattern recognition [58], auto-encoders [59], PMU
voltage time-series [60], voting technique (“vote” for the
best candidate structure) [61], correlation analysis [62], and
maximum likelihood estimation [63], are a few of the proposed
topology search methods.

B) Topology learning: Another set of problems are based
on the assumption that the system operator has very limited
or no knowledge of the basic topology of the network (which
is highly applicable to the secondary distribution networks.)
The objective is to discover the topology of the network by
relying on nodal and branch measurements. Graph-theoretic
algorithms have been used widely for topology discovery
and learning considering different assumptions on system
operator’s knowledge on topology. A sparse graph recovery
model has been adopted in [64] to perform topology discovery,
based on DC PF. The proposed method, which is based
on nodal measurements, requires no a priori information on
the topology of the network. Another data-driven graphical
approach towards topology learning is proposed in [65]. In this
work, an efﬁcient graphical model is developed to represent the
voltage magnitude dependencies (using mutual information as
a measure of afﬁnity) between neighboring buses (the basic as-
sumption in this work is that current injections are statistically
independent.) This method only depends on statistics of nodal
voltage magnitude measurements (smart meter data) to recon-
struct the partially or fully unknown radial or weakly-meshed
topology. It is shown that for a radial feeder, the spanning
tree that maximizes measures of internodal voltage mutual
information corresponds to the true topology of the system.
In [66], using nodal voltage measurements, the authors have
been able to learn the topology of a radial feeder using mutual
statistical properties of the measured variables. The proposed
model is based on a linear approximation of lossless AC PF,

6

and employs a bottom-to-top approach, in which the structure
learning begins with the end nodes and moves towards the
substation by choosing the proper parent nodes at each stage.
The method is shown to have acceptable performance under
a wide variety of assumptions, including no prior knowledge
on the basic topology and missing measurement data. In [67],
graph-theoretic interpretation of principal component analysis
and energy conservation are employed in the context of graph
theory to obtain radial distribution system topology through
smart meter energy usage data. A more general approach
(applicable to meshed networks even with missing PMU
phase measurements) for estimating both the topology of
the network and the line parameters is proposed in [68],
where the line parameters and system topology are updated
consecutively through an EM-based approach. Starting with
an initial topology guess, at each step of the algorithm, the
topology is updated by removing edges with small estimated
susceptance values to improve the estimation likelihood.

VI. DISTRIBUTION NETWORK METERING SYSTEM
DESIGN AND ANALYSIS

A. Metering Instrument Placement

Optimizing the location of metering instruments in distribu-
tion systems is a signiﬁcant subject for research, given the size
of the system and potentially limited ﬁnancial resources [69].
Different objectives have been proposed in the literature to ad-
dress this problem, including improving system observability,
minimizing installation/maintenance costs, bad data detection
capability, and improving the DSSE accuracy [70] [41] [71]
[72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [43] [79] [80]. Different
algorithms have been tried for solving the placement problem,
including Genetic-Algorithm (GA), Mixed Integer Linear Pro-
gramming (MILP), Mixed Integer Semi-Deﬁnite Programming
(MISDP), and Multi-Objective Evolutionary (MOE) methods.
A summary of the different meter placement approaches is
given in Table IV.

METER PLACEMENT METHODS

B. PMU Applications and Impacts on DSSE

PMUs are able to provide synchronized voltage, power,
and current measurements that enable accurate tracking of
state variables and efﬁcient control and management decisions.
Also, generally the sampling frequency of PMUs (up to 30
kHz) is much higher than that of smart meters (0.277 mHz -
16.7 mHz), which leads to system observability on a higher
temporal granularity. However, compared to smart meters, the
use of PMUs in distribution networks is still very restricted due
to their prohibitive costs. Hence, a critical research direction
related to PMUs is optimizing the number and location of
PMUs to enhance system observability, while limiting the
measurement infrastructure costs [81] (also see Section VI-A).
In terms of application in distribution systems, PMUs have
been employed for high-resolution voltage/power proﬁling,
oscillation detection, topology identiﬁcation, and event detec-
tion, as outlined in [82]. On the other hand, smart meters
have been used mostly for low-resolution load forecasting
and management, and connection veriﬁcation [83]. In terms
of algorithm design for DSSE and topology identiﬁcation,
one considerable difference between the methods proposed for
systems with only smart meters and systems with PMUs is
the “small phase angle difference assumption”. Hence, due
to unavailability of phase angle data in absence of PMUs
many papers have assumed that
the nodal voltage phase
angles in a system are almost equal [65], [66], [84]. While
this assumption introduces bounded inaccuracies in the ﬁnal
estimation/identiﬁcation outcomes, it enables system operators
to monitor the state of distribution systems without PMUs.
Furthermore, adding the voltage phase data or ﬂow measure-
ments can highly improve the estimation and identiﬁcation
routines’ performance.

VII. PENETRATION OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES

A few papers have analyzed DSSE under high penetration
rates of renewable power. The main source of challenge in
performing SE in presence of renewable resources is their un-
certain output power [85]. Also, deep penetration of renewable
power sources affect the voltage proﬁle of distribution systems.

7

This stresses the need for more advanced voltage monitoring
capabilities [50]. In case of pseudo-measurement generation
for these resources, it is believed that the non-Gaussian distri-
bution of renewable power would adversely affect conventional
WLS-based DSSE methods. Moreover, as shown in [14], fast
changes in system state can result in the WLS-based DSSE to
get trapped in local minima with errors as high as 105 times the
underlying global solution. Also, given that the performance
of conventional Gauss-Newton algorithm highly depends on
the initial conditions, ﬁnding good initial conditions for DSSE
in systems with deep renewable penetration is a difﬁcult task
[4]. To address these challenges several papers have adopted
different approaches for solving the SE (in general) and DSSE
(in particular) in presence of renewable-based DGs.

Probabilistic methods represent the major group of tech-
niques for modeling the impacts of renewable uncertainty
on SE. A forecasting-aided SE mechanism is proposed in
[86] to capture the temporal and spatial correlation among
DGs and loads for their short-term prediction (to be used
as pseudo-measurements in SE), using a linear autoregres-
sive model. In [29], another forecasting-aided SE method is
proposed to manage the uncertainties of load and renewable
resources based on a GMM technique for obtaining the non-
Gaussian distribution of renewable power while incorporating
the dynamics of the system. Moreover, this estimator shows
good performance even with limited data, which makes it a
promising candidate for DSSE. As an extension to [73], the
effect of the uncertainty of renewable DG power proﬁle on
meter placement has been modeled in [87] using GMM. A
probabilistic graphical modeling technique has been proposed
in [88] for capturing short term uncertainty of SE in systems
with high PV penetration. The physical governing laws of the
system (i.e., PF equations) have been embedded into the SE
model. A distributed belief propagation method is performed
for state inference, which yields superior results compared to
the conventional deterministic WLS method. Another proba-
bilistic approach is adopted in [44] for pseudo-measurement
generation in networks with high residential PV penetration
using Beta distribution functions. It is speculated that the
uncertainty of PV systems has the highest impact on the DSSE
at mid-day time intervals (when usually the load proﬁle is not
peaking.) To model the non-Gaussian uncertainty of PV power
in DSSE, pseudo-measurements are generated (with 15-minute
time resolution) for roof-top dispersed PV systems employing
a weather-dependent model for constructing general PV power
probability density functions, considering solar radiation, tem-
perature, number of arrays and their physical characteristics.
This approach shows considerable improvements on DSSE
accuracy compared to using conventional standard proﬁles.
While in [44] the possible correlation between physically
nearby renewable DGs are not modeled, it is demonstrated
in [16] that including the correlation between close DGs for
pseudo-measurement generation leads to further improvements
in DSSE accuracy.

VIII. CYBER-SECURITY
The vulnerability of the power system against cyber-attacks
types of cyber-

has been observed in practice. Different

TABLE V
AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON SE CYBER-SECURITY

attack related to SE have been modeled and investigated
in the literature: false data injection, topology attacks, and
eavesdropping. In a false data injection situation, an attacker,
with various degrees of knowledge on system parameters and
states, alters the metered data of certain metering devices [89]
[90] [91] [92] [93] [94]. In a topology attack, the attackers
tend to maliciously modify the topology model data of the
system [95] [96] [97] [98] [99]. Eavesdropping deﬁnes a
situation in which an unauthorized party seeks to gather
system data by tapping into the communication infrastructure,
compromising data privacy and conﬁdentiality of users [100]
[15]. A classiﬁcation of different papers with respect to the
issue of cyber-security can be seen in Table V. It can be
concluded that protecting the vital automation and monitoring
systems against cyber intrusion and cyber attacks requires a
holistic approach to preserve the integrity, availability, and
conﬁdentiality of DSSE at all times. Different components of
an effective solution include: adversary identiﬁcation (in terms
of knowledge and resource levels), vulnerability assessment
(critical meters, communication system integration, sensitivity
of DSSE to bad data), and personnel training.

IX. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have presented an overview of the
critical aspects of DSSE. Active research subjects, such as
DSSE problem formulation, pseudo-measurement generation,
network topology, data meter placement, renewable resource
integration, and cyber-security are reviewed. Based on the
survey, most recent works are more concentrated on using
data-driven and machine-learning-based modiﬁcations in the
conventional DSSE (for improving the accuracy, robustness,
and system observability), which is a reasonable direction
given the steep increase in the rate of installation of smart
meters and micro-PMUs at the distribution level. Probabilistic
modeling (in a data-driven context) has also attracted sub-
stantial research works, due to its capability for capturing the
effects of stochastic and variable renewable resources on active
distribution systems in general (and on DSSE in particular.)

X. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

It would be of interest to study how Demand Response
(DR) programs [101] could impact the DSSE (in terms of
uncertainty and variability of customer behavior and pseudo-
load generation) by incorporating retail market signals into
the DSSE problem formulation. In general, integrating the
price-sensitivity of active distribution networks into the DSSE
becomes a valid research problem in future distribution sys-
tems with deep penetration of renewable and DR resources.
In a related context, optimal power management and decision
making under limited distribution system observability appears
to be a largely unexplored direction for research, specially
in presence of emergent technologies, such as energy storage
systems and networked microgrids [102] [103] [104] [105].
is topology learning.
Another very recent area of interest
Future research is needed to discover if and how topology
discovery can be performed after extreme weather events [106]
as the number of data meters decreases due to communication
and device failure, and the observability of the distribution
system is compromised. Employing data-driven methods under
extreme weather events at different stages (pre-event, during
the event, and post-event) for developing system monitoring
and learning techniques is another possible research direction.
Thus, it would be of interest to investigate the impact of
extreme events on distribution system observability and design
potential solution strategies to enable effective system restora-
tion strategies that depend on operator’s real-time knowledge
of system states.
