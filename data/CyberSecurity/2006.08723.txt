Abstract:  Traffic  management, 

and 
environmental impact are important issues in the modern world. 
These  challenges  are  addressed  by  the  application  of  sensing, 
intelligent 
communication  methods 
control 
transportation systems (ITS). A part of ITS is a vehicular ad-hoc 
network (VANET) which means a wireless network of vehicles. 
However, communication among vehicles in a  VANET exposes 
several security threats which need to be studied and addressed. 
In  this  review,  firstly,  the  basic  flow  of  VANET  is  illustrated 
focusing  on 
communication  methods,  architecture, 
characteristics,  standards,  and  security  facilities.  Next,  the 
attacks  and  threats  for  VANET  are  discussed.  Moreover,  the 
authentication  systems  are  described  by  which  vehicular 
networks  can  be  protected  from  fake  messages  and  malicious 
nodes. Security threats and counter measures are discussed for 
different  remote  vehicle  communication  methods  namely, 
remote  keyless 
range 
communication,  cellular  scheme,  Zigbee,  Bluetooth,  radio 
frequency  identification,  WiFi,  WiMAX,  and  different  direct

I.  Introduction 

Vehicular networking for intelligent transportation system 
(ITS)  can  be  considered  as  an  emerging  technology.  It  has 
attracted  the  attention  of  industrialist,  academia  in  USA, 
Japan, and Europe. The association of electric technology for 
automobile  traffic  and  driving  (Japan)  popularly  known  as 
JSK  established  the  idea  of  vehicular  communication  and 
networking  in  the  early  1980s.  The  formal  development 
process began in 1990s in USA. The vehicles used in modern 
times  can  no  longer  be  appraised  as  just  mechanical 
arrangements, including 100 million lines of code in the total 
architecture,  more  sophisticated  than  a  modern  operating 
system.  One  part  of  ITS  is  the  vehicular  ad-hoc  network 
(VANET) which is a wireless network of vehicles. Within a 
VANET, a vehicle can communicate with other vehicles and 
with the  traffic light or other road side infrastructure. These 

vehicles exchange important information for example, traffic 
condition, accident warning, curvature of the roads, etc. 

In a VANET, the main role is performed by vehicles which 
have  computation  facilities  and  can  even  connect  to  remote 
devices like smart phones. A smart vehicle can now provide 
different  facilities  such  as  safety  information,  weather  and 
navigation  information  to  the  driver.  A  vehicle  can  also 
communicate with other nearby vehicles, traffic lights or other 
road  side  infrastructures.  These  facilities  have  brought  a 
number of advantages to the occupants, but there is also the 
introduction  of  hackers  to  track  the  vehicle  and  create 
different forms of risks.  

The severity of cyber threats  in  vehicular communication 

system can be categorized into three ways:   

(i) High  threats:  On-board  diagnostics  (OBD)  hack,  V2V 

hack, V2I hack, GPS spoofing, MITM.   

(ii)  Medium  threats:  key  fob  hacking,  attack  on  control 

area network (CAN) bus, entertainment system hacking.  
(iii)  Low threats: Airbags hacking, brakes hacking  

Figure  1  illustrates  the  common  requirements  needed  to 
establish a highly secured vehicular communication system.

In 
intra-vehicular 
communication  layer,  eavesdropping  may  occur.  Messages 
can be manipulated between cars and roadside infrastructure. 
Threats  to  the  sensing  layer  and  communication  layer  can 
affect the control layer. Speed of the cars and steering control 
can be hampered due to the threats of the control layer [1-3].  
Despite  a  number  of  research  works,  there  are  still  many 
security  challenges  in  vehicle  communication  systems.  This 
paper provides a comprehensive review of the security threats

communication. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section II discusses different remote vehicle communication 
methods namely, remote keyless entry system, dedicated short 
range  communication,  cellular  scheme,  Zigbee,  bluetooth, 
RFID,  WiFi,  and  WiMAX.  The  security 
threats  and 
countermeasures  of  these  systems  are  also  described  in 
Section  II.  Section  III  presents  the  security  issues  and  their 
remedies  for  direct  vehicle  communication  methods  namely 
OBD and USB. Finally, the concluding remarks are provided 
in Section IV.

communication.  With 

Remote  communication  systems  can  be  used  within 
vehicle-to-everything 
this 
communication,  messages  can  be  passed  between  onboard 
units  and  roadside  units.  Weak  Points  can  be  focused  by 
attackers  in  the  area  of  remote  communication  technologies 
for the purpose of tampering wickedly  with a car’s or bus’s 
functioning  from  a  suitable  distance.  Therefore,  attackers 
need  not  connect  external  devices  to  vehicle  ports  for 
achieving 
system 
architectures  [4-6].  There  are  some  limitations  in  remote 
communication  technologies  and  attackers  can  detect  the 
limitations.  Figure  2  classifies  the  remote  communication 
technology  into  several  categories  such  as  keyless  entry 
system  (RKE),  wireless  access  in  vehicular  system,  Zigbee, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), WiMAX, Wi-Fi, etc.

A.  Remote Keyless Entry System  

Remote keyless entry system can also be called remote central 
locking. This system refers to an electronic remote controlled 
lock. This lock can be activated not only by a hand operated 
device  but  also  by  proximity.  The  lock  is  controlled  by  a 
keypad.  The  keypad  is  located  at  or  near  the  driver's  door. 
Ford and Lincoln car brand use this system.  

1)  Threats  

There  are  a  number  of  vehicle  manufacturers  that  use 
cryptographic  RKE  keys.  One  example  is  the  VW  Group 
using  rolling  code  schemes  [7].  However,  the  rolling  codes 
are vulnerable to eavesdrop attacks and RKE cloning. 

At the 2015 DEFCON hacker convention, it was shown that 
attackers could jam the signal to the RKE receiver and use a 
different  receiver  to  store  RKE  codes  [7].  Tewari  et  al.  [8] 
provided an extensive listing of attacks to which RKE systems 
are  vulnerable  and  notes  that  RKE  systems’  three  main 
vulnerabilities are their frequent use of outdated devices and 
techniques, weak cryptographic schemes, and implementation 
faults. Glocker et al. [9] also discussed the potential attacks on 
RKE systems, and Liu et al. [10] examined the vulnerabilities 
of and potential attacks on the Hitag2 cipher, which is used in 
many RKE systems.  

2)   Countermeasures  

S.  Van  De  Beek  et  al.  [11]  designed  a  robust  receiver. 
According to them, the receiver is less susceptible to jamming 
attacks.  Hamadaqa  et  al.  [12]  described  a  Secret  Unknown 
Cipher (SUC) methods that would allow RKE controllers to 
be  cloneresistant.  Garcia  and  Oswald 
[7]  presented 
vulnerabilities  in  keyless  entry  methods.  They  illustrated 
Hitag2 rolling code structure. Hitag2 can be used in vehicles 
made by Alfa Romeo, Ford, Chevrolet, Peugeot, etc. Zhang et 
al.  [13]  presented  effective  k-Means  Authentication  2 
(EKA2).  EKA2  validates  the  revocation  status  of  digital 
certificates  with 
the  help  of  clustering  approach  for 
authenticating RKE devices in order to communicate with the 
vehicle.  Lee  et  al.  [14]  provided  a  Rhythm  Key-based 
approach to encrypting RKE communications.

802.11p-based. This communication provides robust security, 
direct  communication  with  high  amount  of  speed  between 
vehicles  such  as  buses,  cars  and  the  adjacent  infrastructure. 
This system does not involve any cellular infrastructure. IEEE 
related 
802.11p  standard  states  enrichments  of 
applications. Figure 3 shows a basic diagram of DSRC used in 
vehicular  communication.  In  this  figure,  RSU  denotes  the 
road  side  unit  and  V2I  means  vehicle  to  infrastructure 
communication system.

The operating frequency band of DSRC is 5.9 GHz. The FCC 
dedicated a bandwidth of 75 MHz for DSRC technology in the 
5.9 GHz band in 2004. WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular 
Environments) systems include OBUs and RSUs [15]. Y. Li 
[15] illustrated a summary of DSRC and WAVE.

Figure 4. Platooning Scenario  

1)   Threats  

Laurendeau et. al. [16] identified some important threats such 
as  malware,  DoS,  spamming,  black  hole,  location  tracking 
GPS spoofing, etc. These threats are barrier to the security of 
DSRC  or  WAVE  based  networks.  They  used  ETSI’s  threat 
methods  for  threat  identification.  They  discussed  probable 
solutions to the critical threats. According to them, DoS attack 
can  be  considered  as  major  threats.  S.  C.  Urgen  [17,  18] 
proposed  a  simulation  platform  which  supports  both  DSRC 
and  Visible  light  communication  in  platoon.  Urgen  also 
analyzed the stability of platoon under false packet condition 
and  duplication  of  security.  Visible  light  Communication 
(VLC)  a  form  of  optical  wireless  communication  [19]  is 
susceptible  to  attacks  owing  to  the  use  of  antennas  that  are 
omnidirectional. The authors expanded that work in [20] and 
pushed  for a fusion of VCL  and DSRC protocol in order to 
mitigate jamming, packet injection or other attacks in platoon. 
W. Whyte [21] identifies the threats encountered by WAVE 
service  system.  They  observed  that  wave  service  system  is 
susceptible  to  not  only  availability  threats  but  also  privacy 
threats. Privacy threats occur from Eavesdropping attacks.  

2)  Countermeasures  

N.  Lyamin  proposed  a  real-time  detector  that  can  clog 
Distributed of service (DoS) attacks in the VANET platoons 
[22].  Platooning scenario is shown in  figure 4.  The detector 
had  been  validated  in  terms  of  two  condition  within  a  time 
range. They are (i) detection and (ii) false alarm probabilities.  

Huong Nguyen-Minh et al. [23] proposed a detection method 
of  distinguishing  packet  loss  due  to  several  reasons  such  as 
normal collisions and jamming attacks. They also described 
observation and estimation model. They described the impact 
of  wrong  estimation  at  the  time  of  probability  detection 
graphically. Their simulation results showed that when attack 
probability  is  high  then  detection  probability  is  high  and 
collisions condition is low.   

Nidhi Gambhir et. al. [24] proposed  a novel network  model 
with the generation of RSA public or private key pair in order 
to  initiate  connection  in  the  VANET.  Three  common 
techniques  such  as  DES  (Data  encryption 
encryption 
standard),  AES  (Advanced  encryption  standard)  and  RSA 
algorithm  were  discussed  and 
their  performance  was 
compared with the proposed method in terms of computation 
time  of  encryption  decryption  process,  buffer  size  in  bytes, 
encryption  and  decryption 
in  Byte/second.  
Communication  over  IEEE  802.11p  standard  can  be 
accomplished by their proposed hybrid technique.

C.  Cellular Technology  

in  high  vehicle  density 

DSRC has some limitations. The ability of DSRC to support 
reliable  and  efficient  vehicle-to-vehicle  communications  is 
poor  especially 
situations. 
Additionally,  the  allocated  DSRC  radio  spectrum  is  not 
estimated to meet the high data traffic demand for in-vehicle 
internet access. DSRC has short range. The network path in 
which  the  packets  route  to  or  from  the  gateway  reduce  the 
appropriateness  of  DSRC  for  any  Vehicle-to-everything 
communication.  For  this  case,  DSRC  requires  low  latency 
data  dissemination  on  a  large  road  segment.  There  is  also 
limitation of DSRC based CSMA/CA technique, which is the 
main  contention-based  MAC  scheme  employed  by  DSRC

1)  Threats  

Jin  Cao  et  al.  [30]  made  a  number  of  contributions  to  the 
security  characteristics  of  the  LTE  and  LTE-Advanced 
networks.  They  presented  a  summary  of  the  security 
functionality  of  the  LTE  and  LTE-Advanced  networks  with 
the  exploration  of  the  security  weaknesses  existing  in  the 
architecture of the LTE and LTE-Advanced networks.   

There  are  some  security  risks  in  LTE  networks  such  as  the 
vulnerability  to  the  injection,  modification,  eavesdropping 
attacks  [31].  So,  it  has  more  privacy  risks  than  GSM  and 
UMTS [32].  

Ravishankar  Borgaonkar  proposed  a  new  privacy  attack 
against the variants of the authentication and key management 
(AKA) protocol. Their proposed attack breaches the privacy 
of the subscribers’ more rigorously than the common attacks 
do. They show that moderately learning SQN leads to activity 
monitoring  attacks  [33].  LTE  network  suffers  from  various 
attacks such as spoofing the IP address, DoS attacks, worms, 
viruses, etc. [32]. Since LTE femto cell is launched, HeNBs 
(Home enodeB) are attained by the attacker. The attackers can 
modify  the  functionality  of  the  cell  according  to  his  own 
requirements [34].  

David Rupprecht et al. [35] focused on two types of security 
characteristics:  

(a)  Encrypting user data.  

(b)  Authentication of the network.   

A  framework  was  developed  in  [35]  for  analyzing  different 
LTE devices. They show some important characteristics after 
analyzing the device. They are:  

i)  An LTE network can impose on using no encryption   

ii) None  of  the  tested  devices  informs  the  user  about 

unencrypted message.   

iii) MITM  attack  against  an  LTE  device  that  does  not 
fulfill the network authentication requirements.  

2)  Countermeasures  

Liyange  et  al.  [36]  suggested  LTE  security  features. 
According to the study [36], software defined networking and 
network  function  virtualization  concepts  can  improve  the 
security  of  LTE.  J.  Cichonski  et  al.  [37]  provided  some 
solutions  in  order  to  mitigate  the  LTE  security  threats.  The 
study illustrated the use of ciphering indicator that is defined 
in 3GPP TS 22.101. This indicator informs the status of the 
user plane confidentiality protection. They also discussed the 
planning  of  configuration  management,  patch  management, 
malware  and 
implementation 
intrusion  detection  and 
throughout  the  mobile  network  operator’s  infrastructure  for 
the  purpose  of  alleviating  malware  attacks  impacting  radio 
access  network  and  core 
infrastructure,  unauthorized 
operation and access management networks.  

standards, such as IEEE 802.11.  The currently  used cellular 
technology in 4th generation (4G) is the Long-Term Evolution 
(LTE) and LTE-advanced. These systems enable high speed 
wireless cellular communication for a large number of mobile 
users  with 
the  use  of  orthogonal  frequency  division 
multiplexing (OFDM) [5, 19, 25-28], and its multiple access 
version  known  as  OFDMA.  The  next  generation  of  cellular 
systems 5G and 6G are expected to use derivatives of OFDM 
[27] in order to enable even higher data rates for more users 
than 4G. 

Pure-DSRC  vehicle  to  everything  (V2X)  communication  is 
gaining  popularity  with 
the  amalgamation  of  cellular 
technologies  for  various  applications.  Figure  5  shows  a 
scenario  of  V2X  communication  system.  Several  reasons 
exist for this interest:   

a) High network capacity with high bandwidth  

b) Wide cellular coverage range,  

c) Mature  technology,  which  eases  the  implementation  and 
accelerates the deployment of V2X communications.   

In spite of having these benefits, there are also many barriers. 
The  barriers  can  limit  the  ability  of  cellular  technology  to 
support reliable V2X communications.   

Figure 5. V2X communications 

Cellular V2X (C-V2X) has been developed by 3GPP1. This 
technology has two different modes [29]. One is the device to

of cloud services with the use of cellular communication.

N. Vidgren et. Al [41] proposed two types of attacks that can 
harm the ZigBee security. They are:  

(i) Sabotage  attack: It is based on sabotaging the  zigbee end 
devices when it sends a special signal. The signal makes the 
devices wake-up constantly until the battery runs out.   

(ii)  Network  Key  Sniffing  attack:  This  attack  occurs  when 
key exchange system is utilized in ZigBee at the time of using 
standard security level. The security level can be defined by 
the  ZigBee  specification  for  the  purpose  of  interrupting  the 
network key.  

Olayemi  Olawumi  [42]  proposed  three  practical  attacks 
against the ZigBee security.  

(i) Network discovery and device identification attack  

(ii)  Interception of packets attack   

(iii) Replay attack.   

Figure 7 illustrates the process of Replay attack.  

Figure 6. Network Architecture of LTE 

D.  Zigbee  

in  Zigbee 

Zigbee  is  a  wireless  standards-based  technology  for  WSN 
applications  in  order  to  address  the  needs  of  low-cost,  long 
battery  life.  Zigbee  operates  on  the  IEEE  802.15.4  physical 
radio  specification.  It  has  three  operating  frequency  bands 
such  as  868  MHz,  900  MHz  and  2.4  GHz.  ZigBee  allows 
mesh networking facility. With this wireless mesh networking 
facility, ZigBee is applied by routers and receivers in multiple 
application  scenarios  [38].  The  spread  spectrum  technique 
used 
is  direct-sequence  spread  spectrum. 
Modulation  technique  adopted  in  Zigbee  is  offset-QPSK. 
Channel width is 2 MHz and channel spacing is 5 MHz. Yu 
Lei and Jian Wu [39] applied Zigbee technology into forward 
collision waring system (FCWS).  FCWS uses lasers, sensors, 
cameras for scanning the road ahead and alerting the driver if 
the distance to a vehicle ahead is closing too quickly. Sourabh 
Pawade et al. [40] proposed a Zigbee based advanced driver 
assistance systems. This system has two units: (i) mobile unit 
where Zigbee technology was installed (ii) static unit on the 
road.  Mobile  unit  helps  to  alert  the  driver  along  with  audio 
warnings.  Sourabh  Pawade  et  al.  also  designed  a  drink  and 
drive  prevention  system  for  continuous  monitoring  the 
alcohol  level  of  the  driver  in  order  to  reduce  the  accidents 
[40].    

1)  Threats  

There are mainly four concepts of Zigbee based security [41].   

a)  High level of security   

b)  Trust center 

c)  AES and DES 

d)  Message Integrity code   

Figure 7. Process of Replay attack (Adapted from [74]) 

2)  Countermeasures  

Cache  et  al.  [43]  presented  that  the  best  countermeasure 
against the attack is to recognize the effect of this attack. The 
attack should be evaluated in own networks  for recognizing 
the information which is visible to the attacker.   

Olawumi et al. [42] suggested the use of intrusion detection, 
the  installation  of  network  keys  before  deployment,  and  the 
incorporation  of  time-stamping  within  ZigBee’s  encryption 
methods to combat replay attacks.  

(i) Against  interception  of  packets  attack:  Standard  security 
level was proposed in [42]. As a result, administrator will 
get highest level of security.  

(ii)  Against  Replay  attack:    Fusion  of  time  stamping 
mechanism  with  the  AES  was  proposed  in  order  to 
mitigate the replay attack [42].  

E.  Bluetooth  

Bluetooth is a type wireless system. This technology is used 
for exchanging files and messages between fixed and mobile

devices. The range of communication of this device is short. 
Bluetooth  uses  short-wavelength  UHF  radio  waves.  The 
frequency range is 2.40-2.48 GHz. [44]. Some best cars that 
have  good  Bluetooth  facility  are  as  follows,  Chevrolet 
Corvette, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Ram 1500, Toyota Camry, 
etc. Bluetooth Version 5.2 was released on January 2020. Low 
energy  audio,  low  energy  isochronous  channel,  low  energy 
power control are the salient features of version 5.2.  

1)  Threats  

Several research paper  focused  on Bluetooth vulnerabilities. 
According  to  H.  Onishi  [45],  there  are  some  necessary 
vulnerabilities faced in the Bluetooth:  

(i) Security technique is limited.  

(ii)  Permission of user is not required at the time of pairing 

the devices.  

(iii) Virus  or  malware  in  carry-in  devices  can  destroy  the 

security system.  

(iv) After pairing, necessary data  such as password, address 

book can be achieved.  

(v)  Probability of buffer overflow attack. In buffer overflow, 
the  attacker  can  overwrite  the  memory  of  an  application. 
System can be crashed due to this attack.  

(vi)  Malicious  GNSS 
navigation  satellite  system.  GNSS  has  2 
vulnerability:  

signals.  GNSS  means  global 
types  of 

(a) jamming (b) location spoofing

2)  Countermeasures  

H. Onishi offered some technical methods in order to mitigate 
the Bluetooth vulnerabilities [45].    

(i)    Penetration testing  for  mainly V2V communication and 
interfaces of Bluetooth in order to identify threats.  

(ii)  Allowance of certified carry-in devices with proper audit 

in order to connect to vehicles.   

(iii) Intrusion detection for detecting abnormal conditions and 

notifying the driver instantly.  

(iv) Availability of ISO-26262 used  to define the  functional 

hazards.

vehicle 

Wi-Fi  means  wireless  fidelity.    Wi-Fi  is  a  candidate  for 
vehicle 
infrastructure 
communication.  WiMAX  is  faster  than  Wi-Fi.  WiMAX 
means  Worldwide  Interoperability  for  Microwave  Access 
(WiMAX). WiMAX refers to IEEE 802.16 standard. WiMAX 
has  several  features  such  as  low-latency,  Quality  of  Service 
(QoS),  good  security,  all-IP  core  network  support  [47,  48]. 
Wi-Fi  and  WiMAX  system  with  the  help  of  orthogonal 
frequency  division  multiplexing  (OFDM)  [5,19,  25-28], 
multiple access version of OFDM known as OFDMA, MIMO 
technology  can  gain  speeds  in  a  unified  platform  for  voice 
communication, video communication, V2V communication. 
The  advantage  of  using  OFDM  makes  WiMAX/WiFi  to 
overcome the multipath fading effects and still obtain a high 
data rate [26-28]. Benefits from the channel of MIMO system 
[6] can be adopted by Wi-Fi and WiMAX in order to improve 
the  wireless  channel  and  to  double  the  capacity  without 
increasing the channel bandwidth and the required power of 
the  transmitting  antenna.  As  a  result,  the  spectral  efficiency 
can also be increased at an exponential rate.  MIMO system 
also can play an important role in vehicular communication. 
Massive  MIMO  is  considered  a  key  technology  in  5G 
communication [49-51].  

1)  Threats  

Vo-Huu  et  al.  [52]  examined  the  IEEE  802.11  (Wi-Fi) 
standard, and found that its interleaver/ convolutional scheme 
leaves  it  vulnerable  to  jamming  attacks.  Nakhila  and  Zhou 
examined  how  Evil  Twin  attacks  on  Wi-Fi  can  be  detected 
[53]. Scarfone et al. discussed some threats that hampers the 
WiMAX security. The threats are  radio frequency jamming, 
radio frequency interference, DoS, replay, man-in-the-middle, 
and eavesdropping attacks [54]. Kolias et al. [55] provided an 
extensive listing of attacks targeting the WiMAX architecture.  

2)  Countermeasures  

Vo-Huu  et  al.  proposed  incorporating  random,  encrypted 
interleaving in order to protect against Wi-Fi jamming attacks 
[52]. Scarfone et al. [54] described technical countermeasures 
for  WiMAX’s  threats  such  as  Confidentiality  and  Integrity 
Protection,  Authentication  and  Authorization,  Client  Device 
Security,  and  Patches,  Upgrades,  and  Updates.  Kolias  et  al. 
[55] also offered focusing security efforts on the first entry to 
the  network,  private  key  management,  multicast/broadcast 
communications, and mesh mode traffic rerouting in order to 
solve the WiMAX’s vulnerabilities.   

 
Threats and Countermeasures of Cyber Security in Direct and Remote Vehicle Communication System

G.  RFID  

RFID uses radio signals to identify objects. In a RFID system, 
an  RFID  reader  is  able  to  read  or  identify  tags  attached  to 
objects.  Apart  from  vehicle  tracking,  RFID  is  used  for  toll 
collection,  vehicle  performance  monitoring  and  vehicle 
routing [56-58].   

1)  Threats  

Cho  et  al.  [59]  identified  the  two  main  threats  to  RFID 
communication:   

i)  privacy infringement   

ii) forgery.   

other necessary data. It is connected to the check engine light. 
This light illuminates at the time of detecting any problem of 
the system. On-board diagnostics can enable digital ingress to 
the  public  data.  The  data  may  be  error  codes  or  control 
message.  On  board  diagnostics  can  also  enable  access  to 
electronic control unit (ECU) settings that can help in order to 
mitigate theft protection and vehicle’s engine control [66, 67].

Cho  et  al.  also  identified  potential  attacks  against  RFID 
communication as Eavesdropping, Brute Force, Replay, and 
MITM  attacks.  Tyagi  et  al.  [60]  mentioned  some  attacks  in 
VANET such as message spoofing, DoS attack, tracking the 
movement of the vehicle etc.

some 
countermeasures in order to protect the personal data from the 
attacks  and  reduce  the  probability  of  tracking.  Some 
protection methods mentioned in [61] are:  

[61]  proposed 

a)  Delegation Tree 

b)  Tag Killing 

c)  XOR Encryption 

d)  Protocol  based  technique  such  as  grouping  proof

[62],  multi-owner  multi-tag 
protocol 
protocol  [63],  Randomized  Skip  Graphs-Based 
(RSG) RFID authentication [64] etc. 

Kazuya Sakai et. al. [65] proposed a mathematical model after 
investigating the weak privacy in the authentication system of 
RFID. The proposed model in [65] can identify the probability 
of two tags,  which are  linked  with respect to the number of 
group keys. 

III.  Direct Communication  

Modern  day  vehicles  have  a  number  of  ports.  These  ports 
enable vehicles to connect to many external devices.  In this 
way,  drivers  gain  access  to  a  number  of  services  including 
information,  on-board  entertainment,  and 
maintenance 
synchronization  of  mobile  phones. 
the  case,  an 
eavesdropper  gets  access  to  the  vehicle  ports,  he/she  can 
access  the  in-vehicle  network  and  can  attack  the  network, 
install virus or malware. In this section, the vulnerabilities of 
vehicle  ports  are  discussed.  For  this,  on-board  diagnostics 
(OBD)  II  port,  the  universal  serial  bus  (USB)  port,  and  the 
vehicle  charging  ports  are 
into  consideration. 
Furthermore,  the  possible  solutions  to  these  attacks  are  also 
discussed.

A.  OBD-II Ports  

OBD  means  on  board  diagnostics.  OBD-II  is  a  type  of 
computer that is capable of monitoring the speed, mileage and 

2) Works without wire with 

the help of wi-fi or 
Bluetooth.

                          Table 2. OBD generation  

1)   In-Vehicle Network Access Attack  

Paul Carsten discussed some threats of in-vehicle networks in 
a study [68]. In [68], CAN protocol was considered as crucial 
attack  vector  where  CAN  means  controller  area  network.  
CAN  protocol  can  behave  as  a  broadcast  network.  The 
important  feature  of  CAN 
is  efficient  error-checking 
mechanisms.  The  mechanism  can  play  an  important  role  in 
order to confirm that packet errors at the time of transmission 
can be handled proficiently. According to the Carsten et. el. 
[68], the threats are:  

(i) Cannot  able  to  identify  CAN’s  inability  to  identify  the 

legitimate nodes.  

(ii)  Packets do not carry sender address.  

(iii) Packets do not carry receiver address.  

(iv) No node authentication.   

Miller [44] used an ECOM cable and homemade connectors 
for transmitting and receiving messages over CAN.   

2)  Countermeasures  

There are some solutions against the vulnerabilities.   

Schulze et al. [69] proposed data management system (DMS) 
for  the  purpose  of  monitoring  communication  as  well  as 
identification  of  malicious  behavior.  Ling  [70]  provided  an 
algorithmic solution to DoS attack and error flag utilization of 
CAN protocol. According to Liu et al., OBD-II port should be 
separated  from  the  in-vehicle  network  [23].  Oguma  and  his 
team proposed an approach using a method of attestation with 
encryption. This approach is able to identify the nodes existed 
at the startup of the system [71].

B.  USB Port  

USB  ports  are  very  popular  and  these  ports  can  connect 
phones, USB devices with entertainment files and navigation 
systems to the  vehicle [72]. There are several types of USB 
ports: USB-A, USB-B, Mini USB. Micro USB, USB-C.    

1)  Threats  

USB devices persist a target for cyber threats. According to 
the Kaspersky Lab data, 2017, it is showed that in every 12 
months around one in four users worldwide is affected by a 
‘local’  cyber  incident.  These  attacks  are  caused  by  USB 
devices [46].  

2)  Countermeasures  

According  to  Onishi  [45]  protection  against  USB  threats  is 
difficult  because  there  is  high  amount  of  USB  devices 
available  in  the  market.  Two  solutions  were  proposed  by 
Onishi:   

a) Connect USB initially to a website for receiving a security 
certificate.  In 
this  case,  only  USB  devices  with 
certification should be allowed to be used with a vehicle. 

b) Block  propagation  from  a  non-critical  area  to  a  safety 
critical area. In this case, even if a virus or malware gets 
access into a vehicle, it will have less opportunity to get 
into the safety critical portion of the vehicles.

information.  Vehicle 

As  part  of  ITS,  VANETs  can  contribute  to  the  traffic 
management, road safety and drivers’ comfort.  In VANETs, 
the  vehicles  exchange  traffic  conditions,  accident  warnings, 
etc. 
communicate  with 
infrastructures along the roads. Such communication facilities 
have introduced a number of security and privacy threats. In 
this review paper, the cyber security in VANET is discussed. 
Both remote and direct vehicle communication scenarios are 
taken  into  consideration.  A  number  of  threats  such  as  radio 
frequency  jamming,  radio  frequency  interference,  DoS, 
replay,  man-in-the-middle,  eavesdropping  attacks,  virus, 
malware, sniffing, fuzzing, privacy infringement, forgery are 
discussed. Possible safety measures are also described in this 
paper.  In  future,  more  security  frameworks  have  to  be 
designed 
to  ensure  attack-free  vehicle  communication 
systems.
