Abstract—This  work  presents  an  application  of  the  highly 
expressive  Attribute-Based  Encryption  to  implement  wireless-
delimited  Secure  Zones  for  firearms.  Within  these  zones,  radio-
transmitted local policies based on attributes of the consumer and 
the firearm are received by embedded hardware in the firearms, 
which  then  advises  the  consumer  about  safe  operations.  The 
Secure  Zones  utilize  Attribute-Based  Encryption  to  encode  the 
policies  and  consumer  or user  attributes,  and  providing  privacy 
and  security  through  it  cryptography.  We  describe  a  holistic 
approach to evolving the firearm to a cyber-physical system to aid 
in  augmenting  safety.  We  introduce  a  conceptual  model  for  a 
firearm  equipped  with  sensors  and  a  context-aware  software 
agent. Based on the information from the sensors, the agent can 
access  the  context  and  inform  the  consumer  of  potential  unsafe 
operations.  To  support  Secure  Zones  and  the  cyber-physical 
firearm model, we propose a Key Infrastructure Scheme for key 
generation, distribution, and management, and a Context-Aware 
Software Agent Framework for Firearms.

INTRODUCTION 

Advances  of  digital  technologies,  as  they  are  incorporated 
into  devices  for  people’s  usage,  often  result  in  enhancements 
including  ease  of  use,  safety,  precision,  optimizations  in 
resource  consumption  and  costs. 
these 
technological  advances  spawned  a  class  of  systems  named 
Cyber-Physical  Systems,  in  which  computational  elements 
integrate  with  physical  objects,  capable  of  evolving  a  purely 
mechanical device into a cyber-aided version. 

In  particular, 

The  trend  has  touched  several  areas,  producing  machines 
heavily  dependent  on  cyber  systems;  onto  these  machines  we 
rely,  and  to  which  we  happily  entrust  our  lives.  Commercial 
aircraft possess a multitude of onboard systems to aid operation, 
from  fly-by-wire  components, 
that  follow 
navigation maps and can automate landing procedures. Military 
aircraft,  such  as  the  B-2  Stealth  Bomber,  have  exceptionally 
complex avionics, without which the aircraft would be unstable 
to fly [1]. Automobiles usually integrate anti-lock brakes, safety 
airbags, and may be available with traction control and collision 
avoidance systems. During 1991 and 1993 seasons, the Formula 
One (F1) team Williams presented a car equipped with active 
suspension.  The  suspension,  together  with  telemetry,  was 

to  autopilots 

capable of detecting terrain configuration and self-adjusting for 
optimal  aerodynamics  and  equilibrium  of  the  car.  The  system 
gave rise to a car so vastly superior to its counterparts and so fast 
that further F1 regulations banned similar technological driver-
aids [2]. Google is forwarding research in self-driven cars and 
expects them to be available in less than a decade [3]. 

Furthermore, patients surrender their health to pacemakers 
and electronic monitors. There are robotic instruments capable 
of performing surgery [4] (although the delicate and expensive 
nature of its market has recently given raise to scrutiny [5]), and 
ongoing research on human exoskeletons [6]. More and more, 
we  integrate  machinery  with  cyber-capabilities  into  our  daily 
activities  and  experiment  enhanced  safety,  comfort,  and 
productivity. 

One  device  has  persisted  largely  untouched  by  cyber 
technology since its inception possibly in the 12th century: the 
firearm. In light of recent tragic  mass shootings, communities 
again  claim  for  employing  technology  to  boost  firearm  safety 
[7],  [8].  In  this  paper,  we  propose  evolving  this  mechanical 
device into a cyber-physical system for greater consumer safety. 
In our scheme, we also combine the broadcast nature of wireless 
communication  and  the  expressiveness  of  a  one-to-many 
cryptosystem,  Attribute-Based  Encryption  (ABE),  to  establish 
wireless-delimited  zones  within  which,  according  to  choice,  a 
firearm  can  alert  the  consumer,  or  user,  of  unsafe  operation, 
depending  on  attributes  programmed  in  the  gun’s  electronics. 
Furthermore,  we  discuss  incorporating  a  range  of  common 
sensors  to  the  firearms  and  enable  context-aware  decision 
capabilities; by analyzing the several inputs from the embedded 
sensors  and  evaluating  context,  a  firearm  could  alert  the 
consumer  of  unsafe  operations  by  utilizing  haptic  and  visual 
feedbacks. 

Understandably,  adding  electronics  to  a  firearm  can  be 
interpreted  as adding  layers  of  failure  to  a reasonably  reliable 
piece of machinery [9]. However, as we articulated earlier, we 
already depend, for our safety, on engines with high degree of 
integration of electronics, such as aircraft and automobiles: these 
engines  became  safer  and  more  reliable  with  the  aid  of 
technology. It is reasonable to expect that technology can help 
enhance a firearm safe operation. 

In the next section, we survey related work in gun safety. In 
Section  III,  we  present  our  view  of  the  firearm  as  a  cyber-
physical system featuring sensors and a context-aware software 
agent, and in Section IV, the supporting Context-Aware Agent 

 
 
Framework. We describe the fundamentals of Attribute-Based 
Encryption in Section V. Section VI depicts our Secure Zones 
and its operation. The proposed Key Infrastructure Scheme for 
generation, distribution and management of encryption keys is 
discussed  in  VII.  We  conclude  the  paper  with  future  work  in 
Section VIII. 

In  this  document,  we  use  the  definitions  “consumer”  and 

“user” interchangeably. 

II.  RELATED WORK 
Integrating  cyber  technology  in  weapons,  either  for  the 
purpose of increased safety or increased lethal capacity, has been 
proposed for many years. In particular, personal weapons which 
would integrate cyber systems have been known as “smart guns” 
[9]. 

Solutions that involve detecting an authorized consumer by 
means  of  a  wearable  radio  transmitter  include  iGUN  [10],  in 
which the consumer wears a special ring that likely possesses an 
RFID transmitter. When the ring is in close proximity with the 
trigger, an actuator unlocks the weapon. A manual safety lock is 
still available, adding a second layer of security. TriggerSmart 
[11] employs a similar mechanism, however without the second, 
manual  safety  lock,  as  inferred  from  the  available  prototypes 
displayed  in  videos  at  the  time  of  this  writing.  TriggerSmart 
proponents also mention “safe zones” within which guns would 
be remotely disabled. The guns would contain hardware based 
on an RF transceiver and would employ DASH7 wireless sensor 
protocol [12]. 

Armatix [13] utilizes an RFID wristwatch that, in addition, 
allows entering a PIN to unlock the firearm in its radio range and 
may use specific times for gun deactivation. A Target Response 
System would also deactivate the weapon if it were not on target. 
No details are furnished, however, on how this system operates 
and which sensors it involves. 

The  New  Jersey  Institute  of  Technology  presented  a 
prototype  of  firearm  in  which  an  array  of  transducers  (more 
specifically,  pressure  sensors)  distributed  over  the  handle 
detects  the  allegedly  unique  way  a  consumer  grips  a  firearm 
[14], [15]. Using this biometrics data, the weapon may recognize 
authorized  users  and  activate 
locking  mechanism 
appropriately. 

the 

In  our  holistic  approach,  we  augment  these  views  by 
building  a  context-aware  system  in  the  firearm,  assessing  the 
environment  from  an  array  of  sensors  and  constructing  safety 
decisions. Furthermore, our model may offer different operation 
choices,  from  an  off  setting,  to  an  advisory  mode,  to  a  fully 
locking mode, such that our solutions can be validated in short 
term. 

III.  THE FIREARM AS CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM 
With current technology, a firearm could comprise a set of 
sensors enabling it to gather a wide range of information from 
the  environment.  A  software  agent  inside  the  firearm  can 
integrate the contextual information to form an evaluation of the 
immediate situation; the firearm becomes context-aware. Upon 
this evaluation, the firearm can advise the consumer of potential 
unsafe operations through visual or haptic feedback, or actuate 
a locking mechanism. 

However, before firearms can lock themselves, society and 
policy/law must agree on this path. Moreover, to guarantee that 

guns without self-enforcement do not have an unfair advantage 
upon those guns that are able to self-lock, both these types of 
guns (ideally) cannot coexist. To overcome this difficulty in the 
short  term,  our  firearm  model  has  three  modes  of  operation 
(selectable  by  software  or  by  a  PIN  panel):  Off,  in  which  all 
cyber-systems  are  deactivated,  and  the  firearm  functions  as  a 
pure  mechanical  device;  Advisory  Mode,  in  which  the  Secure 
Zone  and  context  agent  act  as  an  advisory  system  for  safe 
operations, indicating unsafe situations by means of visual and 
haptic  feedback;  and  Full  Lock,  in  which,  in  addition  to 
feedback,  the  actuator  can  operate  the  locking  mechanism  to 
prevent the gun from firing. Fig. 1 portrays this cyber-physical, 
context-aware firearm concept. This conceptual model presents 
the sensors, feedback outputs and their corresponding intents as 
listed in Table I.

the  necessary  components  for 
implementing the Secure Zones, described in Section VI. Those 
would involve radio antennas for wireless communications, the 
TPD  with  cryptography  and  context  software  agent,  and 
feedback mechanisms. 

IV.  CONTEXT-AWARE AGENT FRAMEWORK 
We  propose  a  framework  for  context-aware  mobile 
applications,  based  on  software  agents  (Fig.  2),  applied  to 
support  the  firearm  cyber-physical  model.  These  agents, 
implemented on firearms, act on behalf of the consumer/device. 
The agents interact with the environment and network through 
sensors,  and  with  other  agents  and  applicable  software.  From 
data acquired through the array of sensors, consumer input, and 
(possibly) other agents, the agent can build a context and analyze 
it  using  a  range  of  artificial  intelligence  and  statistical  tools. 
Then, the agent can make decisions according to its goals, plans, 
and current state [19]. For brevity and space constraints, we do 
not  develop  a  full  description  of  this  framework  in  this 
document. 

V.  ATTRIBUTE-BASED ENCRYPTION 
In  their pivotal  paper,  Sahai  and Waters  [20]  introduced  a 
new concept for encryption, in which the sharing or access rules 
are expressed in the encryption algorithm itself. Essentially, the 
data  owner  provides  a  predicate  or  function 
 describing  how 
 is an integer that

the data is to be accessed. Each user

this problem, hence called Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). 
𝑓𝑓�𝒜𝒜𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖� = 1
In  ABE,  a  set  of  “attributes”  represents  a  user’s  set  of 
credentials,  and  a  formula  with  these  attributes  as  input 
represents the function. Essentially, the formula acts as an access 
policy. 

. Then, the user with credentials

This work was further expanded by [21], in which ABE was 
formulated in two complementary forms, Key-Policy ABE (KP-
ABE) and Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE). In the former, the 
ciphertexts are generated by including the desired complete set 
of  attributes;  the  formulas  over  these  attributes,  or  the  access 
policies,  are  expressed  in  the  users’  secret  keys.  The  latter

prescribes that the attributes pertaining to a user are expressed 
in that user’s secret key, whereas the formula or access policy is 
attached  to  the  ciphertext  at  the  moment  of  encryption  [22].

VI.  THE SECURE ZONE 
The idea of areas in which guns are unsafe to be operated is 
certainly not new, and forms of it are in fact already in effect. 
Guns are generally not allowed beyond security checkpoints in 
airports, onboard airplanes, in most consulates and embassies, 
etc.  These  zones  must  be 
imposed  by  regulation  and 
enforcement.  We propose to address these safety areas within 
the firearm itself, with the aid of digital technologies. 

One  naïve  approach  to  realizing  safety  areas  would  be  to 
have  the  firearm  communicate  with  a  transmitter  within  the 
safety  area  and  negotiate  its  operations.  This  operation  would 
require two-way radio communications, which is still costly for 
devices that depend on battery, as it would be the case for the 
firearm 
two-way 
communications must employ secure and reliable protocols that 
might result in increased complexity and overhead.

The proper identification of the firearm or consumer poses 
another  challenge.  If  a  gun  or  consumer  is  to  be  uniquely 
identified to establish the authorization to operate the firearm, 
then a gun must transmit this identification to the area controller, 
which would then verify the authorization against a database of 
identifications.  The  area  controller  would  then  inform  its 
authorization  decision  to  the  firearm.  Although  feasible,  this 
protocol  might  incur  scalability  issues.  Moreover,  it  would 
require two-way communications between the gun and the area 
controller,  entailing  a  transmitter  in  the  gun  with  sufficient

power,  and

requirements  for  the  gun  electronic  hardware.  We  visualize  a 
simpler, safer schema, which we depict in Fig. 3. 

In this schema, a Secure Zone comprises one or more radio 
transmitters that will transmit a digital message containing the 
zone  authorization  for  operation  policy  for  firearms.  The 
message consists of an encrypted digital signature together with 
the codification of a firearm operation policy for the zone, using 
CP-ABE.  A  known  signature  from  a  trusted  authority  and  a 
private  component,  which  is  only  known  by  the  trusted 
authority, compose the encrypted digital signature. Each Secure 
Zone  will  have  its  own  wireless  transmission  with  its  own 
encrypted  message  representing  the  firearm  operation  policy 
within that zone.

A  firearm  within  a  Secure  Zone  range  receives  the  zone 
wireless broadcast transmission through its radio interface. The 
embedded  software  agent  attempts  to  decode  the  encrypted 
message  using  the  firearm’s  integrated  private  key,  which 
contains the codified attributes of the firearm and its owner. If 
the  agent  successfully  decrypts  the  message,  it  means  that 

firearm  is  able  to  operate  within  that  zone;  otherwise,  the 
operation  is  not  safe,  and  the  firearm’s  feedback  components 
will actuate to inform the consumer of such. The haptic feedback 
component may vibrate, and the visual feedback component will 
illuminate to alert the consumer. 

VII.  KEY INFRASTRUCTURE SCHEME 

Our Secure Zone scheme uses CP-ABE, and encompasses 
message encryption, key generation, and key distribution. In this 
section,  we  compose  an  infrastructure  to  support  our  scheme, 
which deals with the specifics of our firearm conceptual design 
and  Secure  Zone  scheme.  This  infrastructure  builds  upon 
systems  proposed  by  [29],  [30],  [31].  In  the  following 
descriptions,  we  do  not  mention  some  components:  further 
details can be found in the respective references. 

A.  System Model 

In our model, there are Secure Zone Authorities, a Central 
Authority, and consumers/firearms, depicted in Fig. 4. Each is 
described next. 

1)  Central Authority (CA) 
The CA is managed by the government (the same branch that 
regulates firearms), and it is trusted. The CA’s responsibility is 
to  issue  keys  to  firearms,  manage  the  attribute  set 
,  and 
register  Secure  Zone  Authorities,  sending  them  cryptography 
parameters. 

𝒜𝒜

2)  Secure Zone Authority (SZA) 
The  SZA  is  responsible  for  encrypting  and  wirelessly 
transmitting Secure Zone messages to the consumers/firearms. 
An SZA is managed by a zone administrator or owner, i.e., an 
SZA  comprising  a  certain  shopping  mall  is  managed  by  that 
shopping  mall’s  administration.  SZA’s  must  register  with  the 
CA to receive proper cryptography parameters. 

3)  Firearms (F) 
A  firearm  receives  its  ABE  secret  key  and  other  security 
parameters  upon  registration  with  the  proper  government 
branch. This secret key expresses the attributes established by 
the  government,  according  to  specific  rules  that  consider  the 
firearm and the consumer/owner. 

B.  System Algorithms 

A summary of the system algorithms follows. 
Setup: randomized algorithm run by the CA and SZA. CA: 
takes the security parameter as input; outputs an ABE system 
public key and an ABE system master secret key; also generates 
a  public/private  key  pair  for  CA  usage.  SZA:  generates  a 
public/private key pair for SZA usage.

periods  elapsed  since  a  given  timestamp  (such  as  the  Unix 
epoch) [32], [33]. The idea is that if two parties have the same 
algorithm and the same seed (and synchronized clocks), legally 
obtained  from  a  trusted  source,  both  parties  can  generate  the 
same number and thus one party can verify the authenticity of 
the other just by asking for the current generated number.

By using a token authenticator, the software agent is able to 
detect  problems  with  the  transmission  or  a  potential  replay 
attack. If an attacker records a transmission and later replays it, 
there  will  be  a  token  mismatch,  as  the  token  authenticator 
algorithm will generate different numbers based on the current 
time.  Therefore,  the  hash of the  token  and the  symmetric  key 
(the token itself) will change periodically. Notice that the actual 
token is never transmitted; both parties (firearm and SZA) can 
generate  similar  tokens  given  the  same  secret  seed,  algorithm 
and current time. 

Likewise, the simple timestamp and expiration time protocol 
allows  the  agent  to  verify  the  validity  of  the  secret  key.  The 
agent can be programmed to enforce a key update as soon as an 
expiration event happens. 

5)  Revocation and Expiration 
In this key infrastructure scheme, the key revocation happens 
when  they  expire.  On  this  event,  CA  must  generate  a  new 
consumer secret key, as described before. 

6)  Key Update 
If a consumer wants to claim more attributes in addition to 
his/her  current  ones,  follow  the  same  procedure  for  consumer 
secret key generation, when CA will generate a new secret key. 

VIII.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 

We proposed Secure Zones, wireless-delimited areas within 
which  encrypted  messages  using 
the  Ciphertext-Policy 
Attribute-Based  Encryption  and  expressing  a  zone’s  security 
policy are transmitted to our model application, firearms, within 
range. This cryptography maintains both privacy and security of 
communications,  and  its  expressiveness  means  only  firearms 
possessing  the  necessary  attributes  are  able  to  decrypt  those 
messages (through their agents). Thus, these firearms/agents can 
evaluate whether the firearm may operate within the zone. To 
support Secure Zones, we propose a Key Infrastructure for key 
generation,  management,  and  distribution.  The  scheme  uses  a 

5 

 
 
Central Authority for key generation, Secure Zone Authorities 
for encrypted message transmission, and timestamps and token 
authenticator algorithm for verifying authenticity and validity. 

Furthermore,  we  presented  our  view  of  the  firearm  as  a 
cyber-physical  system.  In  our  model,  digital  technologies 
enhance a firearm’s safety through several components. In one 
component, we designed a conceptual model of a firearm fitted 
with an array of sensors and a context-aware software agent. The 
software agent uses the sensors and its agent programming to 
evaluate  context  and  advise  the  consumer  of  potential  unsafe 
operations. We introduced a Context-Aware Agent Framework, 
upon which those agents are built. Our initial experimentation 
focuses on implementing the key infrastructure and performing 
simulations,  in  which  we  evaluate  and  demonstrate  whether 
mobile users within secure zones range can properly receive and 
decrypt the messages, if they have the appropriate attributes. 

Our future work involves investigating the effectiveness of 
the proposed security model, and how to best address the issues 
of key revocation and update, as well as its performance in light 
of several attack vectors. Moreover, we will augment our model 
with delegating key generation to the Secure Zone Authorities, 
and prototype components of the system. We will scrutinize a 
suitable  wireless  communication  infrastructure  for  the  Secure 
Zones, such as [34] and [35]
