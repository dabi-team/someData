Abstract 

In the backdrop of growing power transitions and rise of strategic high tide in the world, the 
Indo  Pacific  Region  (IPR)  has  emanated  as  an  area  which  is  likely  to  witness  increased 
development & enhanced security cooperation through militarization. With China trying to be 
at the seat of the Global leadership, US & its allies in the Indo pacific are aiming at working 
together,  finding  mutually  beneficial  areas  of  functional  cooperation  and  redefining  the 
canvas  of  security.  This  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  analyze  an  informal  alliance, 
Quadrilateral Security dialogue (QUAD) in its present form with the geostrategic landscape 
in  Indo  pacific  and  present  recommendations  to  strengthen  collaboration  &  response 
capability. To advance the main arguments, this paper project proceeds as follows.  

In  Chapter  1,  we  furnish  a  big  picture  on  the  changing  geopolitical  and  geoeconomics 
scenario  due  to  Chinese  expansionary  attitude  in  Indo  Pacific,  which  make  the  region 
significant and motivates for an inquiry into its future course of action & alignment. Chapter 
2,  collates  the  arguments  about  the  existing  geopolitical  shift  in  the  international  relations 
which pave the way for formal and informal alliances by comparing their framework. Next, 
we examine the interests and motives of QUAD countries in Indo Pacific with reference to 
growing Chinese aggressive strides in the region. We probe Chinese strategy in Indo Pacific 
& its manifestation as a coercive power leveraging economic investment for projection in the 
maritime domain. In Chapter 3, through our literature survey, we show that the existing work 
does not highlight specific scope for collaboration by the QUAD countries especially in the 
Cyber and Space domain and there is a need to focus on distinct use cases in both domains. 
Against  this  back  drop,  Chapter  4,  covers  deliberation  on  the  present  work  and  provides 
specific policy recommendations for the alliance. Lastly, in Chapter 5, we conclude with our 
summary  by  visualizing  the  way  forward  for  the  QUAD  alliance  based  on  evolving 
geopolitical and security landscape.

1. Introduction & Motivation 

Global  world  order  and  geopolitics  have  witnessed  major  shocks  in  recent  years  in  the 
backdrop of COVID 19 pandemic, the Taliban 2.0 episode and the recent Ukraine crisis. A 
major shift in international relations and norms is taking place with several countries opting 
for alliances adapting to changed security threats. The power parity in the present world order 
has begun to drift from the Atlantic to the east, making Indo pacific as one of the hotspots of 
geopolitical rivalry which basically paves way for the conceptualization and concretization of 
the  Indo  pacific1.  The  year  2021  witnessed  a  substantial  awaking  in  the  Indo  pacific  with 
major  policy,  framework  and  posture  adaptations  by  countries  within  &  outside  the  region. 
Globally,  the  dynamic  geopolitical  landscape  is  making  countries  choose  sides  and  forge 
partnerships    to  contain  the  threat  posed  by  growing  rivalry  between  the  US,  Russia  and 
China.  Many  new  informal  and  formal  partnerships  are  being  initiated  in  the  geostrategic 
space due to hardening power rivalry and competition as countries assess emerging threats, 
challenges and opportunities in the region.2 
The Indo pacific region is a conflux of Indian Ocean and the Pacific ocean which serves as a 
nest of major rising powers. China, India and ASEAN have the world’s largest population & 
GDP  share  globally,  share  world’s  busiest  trade  routes,  and  most  importantly  powerful 
military forces.

China, in the past decade has seen an exponential rise in its economic and military spheres. 
When  seen  in  the  light  of  Belt  and  Road  Initiative  (BRI),  the  sphere  of  influence  looks 
limitless as the project not only focuses on economic leaps but strategic aspects as well.3

accelerating  tectonic  changes  to  balance  economic  and  strategic  weight  both  in  the  US  and 
EU Indo pacific region.4 (Ref Figure 2)

With  growing  influence  of  China  particularly  in  South  East  Asia,  maritime  and  border 
disputes  will  perpetuate  to  create  friction.  It  is  imperative  that  the  long  term  interest  of  the 
regional  powers  in  military  and  economic  domains  converge  to  stabilize  the  balance  of  the 
regional order and desire to counterbalance China gets adequate focus.  5 Figure 3 provides a 
snapshot of the incidents specifically in South China Sea (SCS) from local and international 
news resources from 2012-2019 and it is found that 52% of the reported incidents were from 
Chinese vessels.6

The  Quadrilateral  Security  Dialogue  colloquially  called  QUAD,  is  an  informal  alliance 
between  US,  India,  Japan  and  Australia  which  has  been  revived  due  to  common  threat 
perception by QUAD countries to counter China’s rising influence in the Indo Pacific region. 
What started as an adhoc arrangement of like-minded countries during the 2004 Tsunami has 
now established itself as a critical pilaster in the Indo Pacific region with a more assertive and 
shifting tone from the past. At present, QUAD has been raised up to a leader level dialogue 
which  has  developed  a  refurbished  working  group  system  for  cooperation  significantly 
broadening  and  deepening  their  vision  on  agendas  in  the  field  of  climate  change,  vaccines, 
critical & emerging technologies, infrastructure, cyber and space.7  

The  current  stature  of  QUAD  raises  certain  questions  on  its  future  course  of  action  & 
alignment with the changing geopolitical and geoeconomics scenario.  

a)  How well the informality of the QUAD alliance will pay expected dividends and set 

the course for containing assertive China? 

b)  Will the working group structure deliver concrete results in the fields they have been 
conceived? Is there a flexibility within the alliance that can transform it into a formal 
alliance at the time of crisis? 

c)  Are the areas of cooperation overcoming strategic challenges & whether the countries 

will be able to accrue benefits in terms of strategic and security needs?  

d)  Have specific areas in the agenda been addressed where collaboration can benefit not 

only the QUAD countries but other countries in the Indo Pacific?

Above questions are thought provoking & worth considering to visualize the future construct 
of the QUAD alliance. This paper aims to address specific areas which needs collaboration 
by  the  QUAD  countries  within  the  working  group  system  for  a  more  constructive  and 
efficacious  partnership.  In  the  next  sections,  we  proceed  by  collating  and  summarizing  the 
arguments on the existing geopolitical shift in the international relations which pave the way 
for  formal  and  informal  alliances  and  in  the  context,  consider  emergence  of  QUAD.  We 
examine  the  interests  and  motives  of  QUAD  countries  for  collaboration  with  common 
interests and how they envision the Indo Pacific region as a pivot for strengthening ties. Next, 
we  provide  a  forecast  on  how  China  will  expand  in  the  region  in  the  garb  of  economic 
investment through its ambitious BRI and use the infrastructure developed for projection in 
the maritime domain conforming to  bolster its strategy to evolve as a global leader.  We then 
take two crucial fields of Space and Cyber security where through our literature survey, we 
show  that  at  present  the  existing  work  does  not  provide  key  areas  for  collaboration  by  the 
QUAD  countries  and  needs  focus  on  specific  segments  in  both  domains.  Against  this  back 
drop,  we  predict  the  future  manifestation  of  QUAD  as  an  alliance  and  provide  specific 
recommendations for its way forward in the coming years.

2. Background and basics 

2.1 IGOs as formal and Informal alliances 
The vacuum created by the shifting power balance in the present geopolitical world has led 
countries  to  collaborate  multilaterally  through  formal  &  informal  alliances  to  protect  their 
geostrategic,  geopolitical  and  economic  interests.  Scholars  of  International  relations  (IR) 
scholars have observed IGOs primarily as agents  of  states  and  have concentrated on  their  
structural  characteristics,  governing  processes,  and  programs.8  IGOs  are  perceived  to  be 
actors  with  whom,  the  members  persuade  states  to  act  by  coordinating  their  efforts  in 
providing  them  diplomatic  skills  for  securing  agreements  to  ensure  effectiveness  of 
programs.9  The  functions  of  IGOs  have  been  identified  as  ‘informational’,  in  which 
gathering, analysing and dissemination of information is undertaken or ‘normative and rule 
creation’  which  involves  supervising  &  allocating  resources  for  operational  mechanism. 
IGO’s prove to be one of the means which the emerging, regional and small powers use for 
power  transitions  to  acclimate  them  for  own  political  and  economic  benefits.  For  example, 
NATO  during  its  transformation  in  1990’s  was  portrayed  from  a  well-defined  military 
alliance  to  an  arrangement  which  offered  “collective  security”  and  a  “promoter  of 
democracy” in order to expand its membership.10 Figure 4 provides an illustration of how a 
formal alliance NATO, has grown over the years from a dozen countries to 30 as of 2020.

Nation  states  within  themselves  have  asymmetric  advantages  of  governance  apparatus  for 
mobilizing  its  population  but  lack  collective  mobilization  across  sovereign  borders.11 
International  organizations  provide  them  with  a  platform  for  collective  mobilization  to

engage  in  a  joint  action.12  The  creation  of  these  formal  IGO’s  reflect  a  balanced  equation 
between the powerful countries and their weak counter parts. The powerful states accept the 
institutional  norms  to  set  the  rules  and  the  weak  states  accrue  the  benefits  out  of  the  rule 
based mechanism to counter the power driven governance by other hegemons.13 Vabulas and 
Snidel  provide  a  theoretical  analysis  of  IGO’s.  The  author’s  analyse  a  spectrum  of 
arrangements  to  highlight  significant  variation  in  formalization  of  the  international 
institutions  and  proclaim  why  the  choices  are  driven  to  informal  arrangements  over  a 
formal.14  IIGOs (Informal Intergovernmental Organizations) provide an increased flexibility 
in  comparison  to  FIGO’s  (Formal  Intergovernmental  Organizations)  which  have  a  binding 
commitment  of  states.  They  maintain  state  autonomy  with  minimal  bureaucratic  costs  and 
have  a  lower  transaction  cost  for  implementation.  As  far  as  policy  implications  are 
concerned, IIGO’s are apt choices to mediate power shifts as the nature of flexibility provides 
a forum for gradual adaptation before reaping the long term benefits.15 If we track the growth 
of the IIGO’s (which include one or both US and China since 1940), it is assessed that IIGO’s 
have risen dramatically after the China’s power shift in 1990’s by approximately 68 percent 
in comparison to FIGO’s which have remained dormant. 16 (Refer Figure 5)

50., fig.1. 
A prime reason for countries to opt for IIGOs is the amount of flexibility which the IIGO’s 
provide  to  adapt  to  dynamic  changes  &  respond  spontaneously  without  enforcing  a  nation 
state into an institutional distribution of power. The mode of institutional change which has 
driven  the  IIGO’s  post  1990’s  fall  in  the  category  of  ‘system  management’  of  powershift 
category where collaboration of like-minded nations and hegemonic consensus favours for a 
deeper  understanding  over  a  common  cause  in  contrast  to  redistributive  and  integrative 
strategies. 17

2.2 Characterisation of QUAD as an informal alliance. 

The  QUAD  displays  many  attributes  of  a  highly  informal  IGO  and  naming  it  as  a  security 
dialogue forges it to be a dialogue, which is fallacious and lacks substance.18 The informality 
of  QUAD  alliance  in  all  proportion,  suits  its  members  as  it  is  mutually  constitutive  & 
reinforcing.  In  addition,  it  places  minimal  obligations  on  member  states  over  converged 
interests.  Its  colloquial  nature  allows  the  member  states  to  signal  different  messages  as 
opportunities  in  the  shadow  of  strong  partners  to  convey  hard-line  stands.  As  an  example, 
Japan  sees  the  hard-line  stand  of  US  against  China  as  an  opportunity  not  to  issue  direct 
statements on its own rather leverage the necessary space created by Washington’s language 
to its own advantage on contentious issues with China.19 The conglomeration proves itself as 
dual  purpose  tool  to  counter  balance  Chinese  hegemonism  and  as  a  diplomatic  hedging 
mechanism. Its ambiguous form provides flexibility in its form, allowing it to be augmented 
in  response  to  any  negative  behaviour  by  China,  or  taper  down  if  it  behaves  well.  Its 
submerged position, intrigued structure and pliability puts the liability back on China court.20
2.3. Growing interests of QUAD  nations in the Indo pacific 
In  the  21st  century,  Indo  pacific  region  has  been  recognised  as  one  of  the  most  vital  to 
prosperity  and  security  in  the  global  context.  It  attracts  key  stake  holders  to  bring  their 
interests  on  a  common  platform  to  gain  strategic  value.  The  region  faces  aggravated 
challenges  through  coercive  and  aggressive  moves  of  China  in  the  economic,  military  and 
technological domain. This section analyses the strategic interests of QUAD countries in the 
Indo Pacific, reflecting importance of building collective capacity by nation states as part of 
regional alliances to advance their broad strategic interests. 
2.3.1 United States Indo Pacific Strategy 
US has a presence of maximum “boots on ground” in the Indo Pacific region than any other 
offshore  base.  It  is  a  vital  source  of  Foreign  Direct  Investment  (FDI)  and  a  source  of 
approximately  3  million  jobs  which  creates  a  manoeuvre  space  of  potential  importance  for 
the  US  in  the  future.  21  US  recognises  Indo  Pacific  as  part  of  its  vital  strategy  for  its 
consistent role and commitment in the region as it transforms to become the center of gravity 
in the years to come.22 Some of the challenges posed to the status of US as a dominant power 
are  due  to  Beijing’s  continued  military,  economic  and  diplomatic  power  plays  in  Asia.23 
China’s adventurism in the East and South China Sea and more so its posturing with the key 
US  allies  Taiwan,  Japan,  Australia  and  India  is  a  major  cause  of  concern  for  the  US 
dominance.24  In  the  month  of  February  2022,  US  released  its  Indo  Pacific  Strategy  (IPS) 
which lays out the narrative of its interest in the region & in support of a collective response 
against the Chinese growing influence. The themes presented in the policy as “Driving Indo 
Pacific prosperity” and “Bolster Indo pacific security” presents an innovative framework for

close  economic  integration  and  in  aid  to  regional  peace,  security  and  stability.25  The  IPS 
makes a ‘qualifier response’ to the open competition between US & China, intended as a sign 
of  a  barge  in  style  from  the  previous  administration.  However,  the  release  of  the  strategy 
before the revised “National Security Strategy” & “National Defence Strategy” puts a factor 
of  uncertainty  in  the  assertive  tone  of  the  US.26  In  the  Obama  administration,  TPP  (Trans 
Pacific  partnership)  was  thought  as  a  tool  to  rewrite  the  rules  of  engagement  with  China, 
however  the  failure  of  TPP  meant  that  US  should  come  up  with  a  revised  “Integrated 
Deterrence  Policy”.  US  focuses  the  strategic  competition  against  China  by  leveraging  key 
military advantages, promote democratic values, invest in niche technologies and revise vital 
security & economic partnerships.  
Washington  aspires  toward  a  Free  &  Open  Indo-Pacific  (FOIP),  defined  on  the  pillars 
of  respect  for  sovereignty,  independence  of  nations,  greater  transparency,  peaceful 
resolution  of  disputes,  free  and  fair  trade,  adherence  to  international  law,  and  good 
governance.27 It pledges support for deepening bilateral & multilateral partnerships, regional 
connectivity, trade & investment, and emphasizes cooperation with regional partners through 
“Indo Pacific Economic Framework”, to identify new propositions to trade which meet high 
labour  and  environmental  standards.28  The  ‘integrated  deterrence’  which  is  supposedly  the 
corner stone of the US approach, will potentially be challenging to integrate efforts across all 
spectrum  of  conflicts  to  counter  coercion  and  reinforce  deterrence.  29  Against  the  increase 
sophistication  and  aggressive  behaviour  of  PLAN  and  Russian  federation,  US  has 
conceptualized the strategy of “Advantage at Sea”30 to prioritize controlling of seas, increase 
its forward deployment and realign warfighting organizations. At present, approximately 60 
percent of the US forces are in the Indo Pacific region.31 There is a massive transformation of 
the  Marine  Corps  being  completed  to  generate  greater  expeditionary  power  with  enhanced 
sea denial and control capabilities.32 
2.3.2 Australia and the Indo Pacific 
Australia  has emanated  as  a  key  strategic  player  in  the  Indo-Pacific  region  in  the  midst 
of  strategic  shifts.  China  endures  to  be  Australia’s  largest  trading  partner33  and  both 
countries  have  displayed  growing  concerns  over  each  other’s  stance  during  multilateral 
forums. Its geographic location bordering Indian ocean to the west, Pacific Ocean in the 
east and the ASEAN states in the north makes it’s a centre piece in the Indo Pacific.

The Australian perspective of the balance of economic opportunities & strategic challenges in 
the  Indo  Pacific  region  began  to  see  new  light,  with  latter  proving  to  be  of  greater 
significance  during  successive  defence  and  foreign  policy  white  papers  namely:  The  2016 
Defence White Paper (DWP), The 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper (FPWP), and the latest, 
The 2020 Defence Strategic Update (DSU).34 The DWP which act as vision document for 20 
years  focuses  on  six  key  drivers  shaping  Canberra’s  strategic  environment:  1)  China  &  US 
cooperation  and  competition  2)  challenges  to  the  rules  based  order  3)  terrorism  4)  state 
fragility  5)  military  modernisation  and  6)  new  complex  &  nongeographic  threats,  including 
cyber-attacks.35  Australia  aims  to  strengthen  ties  with  US  &  other  nations  to  manage 
uncertain  security  environment  and  commits  an  increased  defence  spending  over  a  eleven 
year period.36 Canberra’s Defence Strategic Update-2020 provided the guidance towards 
this  change  “to  ensure  Australia  is  able  to  deploy  military  power  to  shape  its 
environment,  deter  actions  against  its  interests  and,  when  required,  respond  with 
military force” focusing on Indo-Pacific.37 
In  December  2020,  Australia  voiced  for  an  independent  investigation  on  the  origins  of 
COVID-19 pandemic38, which was accused by Beijing and led to targeting of Australian 
imports particularly, barley, beef, wine and coal. Canberra has discerned that its interests 
in  the  Indo-Pacific  region  are  unprotected  &  vulnerable  to  economic  coercion, 
disruptions and grey zone attacks by adversaries.39 As mass proportion of its trade passes 
through  sea  lanes  of  South  East  Asia40  and  Indian  Ocean,  Australia  at  present  is 
intensifying  its  interests  in  the  Indo  Pacific  region  by  conceptualizing  a  robust  strategy  to 
prioritize its potent capabilities. It has been an alliance partner with the US for past 70 years 
since  the  inception  of  1951  ANZUS  (Australia,  New  Zealand  and  United  States)  Security 
Treaty41.  The  AUKUS  (Australia-UK-US)  treaty  which  came  into  effect  just  before  the 
September  QUAD  Summit42,  has  further  strengthened  the  alliance  as  they  reviewed  the 
progress of the partnership towards nuclear stewardship equipping Australian Navy a heft in 
the  pacific.43  The  AUKUS  leaders  during  the  meeting  on  5  April  2022  reaffirmed  their 
resolve  &  commitment  to  a  FOIP  and  to  an  international  system  having  respect  for  human

rights,  rule  of  law,  and  peaceful  resolution  of  disputes  free  from  coercion.44  The 
implementation  of  the  AUKUS  will  arm  Australia  with  conventionally  armed  nuclear 
submarine  capability  and  provide  optimal  pathway  to  establish  joint  advanced  military 
capabilities  by  in  developing  undersea  capabilities,  accelerate  investment  in  niche 
technologies  and  advanced  cyber  capabilities  &  electronic  warfare  capabilities.45.  Australia 
has been challenging the assertive and coercive strides of Beijing since 2016 when it became 
the first country to recognize the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration decision against China 
to abide by the ruling.46 Expressing its vital concerns on the national security, Australia was 
amongst  the  first  country  to  ban  Huawei  from  participating  in  the  rolling  out  of  the  5G 
network47. Canberra acknowledges that the Chinese BRI has an attractiveness that makes the 
Pacific  Island  nations  vulnerable  to  falling  prey  to  ‘debt  trap  diplomacy’.48  It  asserts  to 
expand its efforts to portray itself as a reliable partner in the Pacific Island nations and has 
stressed basing its relations on openness, respect, and equality.49 
2.3.3 Japan and the Indo pacific 
Historically  a  trading  nation,  Japan  has  remained  concerned  about  its  maritime  focus  even 
after being demilitarized after the World War II. Post the world war, Japan has emerged as a 
leading commercial industrialized country in ship building and fisheries under the shadowed 
maritime  security  through  the  US  dominance.  The  growing  concern  with  the  Chinese 
increased footsteps in the maritime domain has led Japan to rethink its perceptions in the Indo 
pacific  region.50  Late  Japanese  Prime  minister  Shinzo  Abe  during  his  tenure  gave  an 
emphasis toward increased partnership in the Indo Pacific and referred to Japanese pillars of 
diplomacy symbolizing the need for “Arc of freedom and Prosperity”51, “Confluence of two 
seas” 52and “Asia’s democratic Security Diamond”53. In 2014, Japan revised its policy on the 
long standing policy of armed exports which prevented Japanese industry to export weapons 
and related technology thereby agreeing to export services in surveillance, rescue, warning, 
transport and minesweeping.54 In 2022, in order to strengthen its security cooperation, Japan

allowed export of fighter jets, missiles and weapons to 12 nations (QUAD countries included) 
with  an  aim  to  bolster  deterrence  capability  and  counter  its  outlandish  claims.55  The  core 
element  of  the  Japan’s  IPS  is  centred  around  economic  sectors  namely  energy  and 
infrastructure. The energy sector prompted a policy decision for Japan to focus on becoming 
a  key  supplier  of  the  LNG  thereby  reducing  the  trade  imbalance  with  US  and  providing 
regional  customers  an  alternative  to  China.  Being  a  pioneer  in  building  high  tech 
infrastructure, Japan acquired a powerful edge over strengthening infrastructure governance 
by  maximizing  infrastructures’  positive  impact  with  economic  efficiency  and  building 
resilience  against  natural  disasters.56  The  Japanese  Self  Defence  forces  have  been  little 
effective  due  to  less  political  support  from  the  leaders.  The  little  interoperability  within  its 
branches  and  with  the  US  made  a  strong  reason  for  Japan  to  have  bilateral  ties  with  the 
nations to fix it deficiencies and garner external support. 57 
In the disputed Senkaku island of Japan, China has employed its Coast guard vessels and its 
deliberate activities have increased manifold (From 12 incidents in 2011 to 1,097 in 2019).58 
Japan has been expressing its strong concern on the Chinese ships violating the international 
law  and  each  time  Chinese  coast  guard  ship  intrude  Japanese  territorial  waters,  Japanese 
patrol  vessels  confront  them  and  simultaneously  a  protest  is  lodged  through  the  diplomatic 
channel.  59  Taking  into  consideration  the  strategic  uncertainty  over  Japan's  international 
coalition-building initiatives to create a new regional order, it has used ‘tactical hedging’ as a 
tool by taking a flexible approach in its ambiguous FOIP concept to gauge states responses, 
interpret  their  perspectives,  and  its  strategic  emphasis  accordingly.60  Japan  has  been 
intensifying its effort under the “Proactive Contribution to International Peace” in line with 
its national security strategy and has made an effort to “internationalize” Chinese behaviour 
by  arguing  that  other  nation  states  in  the  South  China  Sea  are  equally  affected  by  similar 
challenges which Japan faces in the East China Sea.61  
2.3.4 India and the Indo pacific. 
India has been concerned about its strategic and military posture from a mainly continental 
perspective as it has been facing disputes with its largest neighbours, China and Pakistan. In 
the past, India has underutilized the maritime sphere for economic growth and development 
as well as for expanding options with Pakistan and China. As India is located in the heart of 
the  Indian  Ocean  region  and  shares  3,488  Km  land  border  with  China62,  it  presents  both

opportunities and challenges that are important in geopolitics and security dimension of Indo 
Pacific.63  India  adopts  a  well-defined  view  of  the  link  between  economic  growth  and 
prosperity  with  the  help  of  global  engagement  in  the  Indo  pacific.  For  contemporary  India, 
development  resides  primary  on  securing  the  Sea  Lanes  of  Communication  (SLOC)  for  a 
boost in maritime economic activities, trade and energy security. In the present era, India’s 
economic  growth  is  critically  premised  on  the  Indo-Pacific  region  especially  in  terms  of 
growth  potential  and  resource  dependence.  Around  95  percent  of  the  country’s  trade  by 
volume  and  68  percent  by  value  is  moved  through  the  oceans.64  From  the  lens  of 
Kautaliya65,  the  cooperation  and  collaboration  are  its  tools  for  maintaining  security  and 
prosperity  in  the  region  through  concerns  of  global  commons  &  interdependent  maritime 
routes.  Thus,  the  immediate  neighbourhood  in  the  maritime  domain  is  considered  as 
associates  rather  than  adversaries.66  The  Indo-Pacific  presents  itself  as  a  new  domain  in 
India’s foreign policy engagements which needs a shift in its strategic environment from its 
continental borders to the maritime space and addressing concerns on key choke points and 
major sea routes. 67 (Refer Figure 6)

2.4. Genesis of the QUAD and the present status 
The Quadrilateral Security dialogue (QUAD) began as a loose partnership after the Tsunami 
disaster  in  2004  attracting  a  joint  effort  for  humanitarian  and  disaster  assistance  by  like-
minded  countries  of  US,  Australia,  Japan  and  India.70  However,  for  next  three  years  the 
alliance did not see any active participation or activity by any member states. In 2007, Late 
Japanese  PM  Shinzo  Abe  took  an  initiative  to  gather  the  countries  together  again  in  the 
backdrop  of  the  ASEAN  regional  forum  in  Philippines,  but  under  unclear  objectives  and 
Chinese  pressure,  the  countries  hesitated  to  align  on  common  interests.  The  four  member 
countries  with  1.8  billion  people  represent  a  quarter  of  the  world’s  population  and  have  a 
combined  GDP  of  over  USD  30  trillion.  Trade  between  the  QUAD  countries  exceeded 
USD440  billion  in  2018,  with  approximately  USD  6  trillion  in  trade  with  the  rest  of  the 
countries in the world.71 The country profile in terms of population, armed forces, GDP and 
defence budget is shown in Table 1.

QUAD commitment by participating in the QUAD naval exercises. The revival of the present 
QUAD  was  done  in  2017  to  counter  increased  Chinese  assertions  in  the  Indo  Pacific  &  a 
special emphasis was given by Trump and Biden leadership who saw QUAD as a pivot for 
focusing  its  interest  in  the  Indo  pacific.  The  QUAD  countries  exchange  views  on

2021 hosted by Biden administration taking the lead to align the QUAD interests with the US 
Indo Pacific Policy in the region. Three working groups on vaccines, climate and critical and 
emerging  technologies  were  formalized.    The  goal  of  the  QUAD  countries  was  to  keep  the 
military and political influence out from the SLOC, maintain a rule based order for freedom 
of navigation & liberal trading and most importantly create an alternative to “Debt financing” 
in  the  region73.  In  the  meeting  held  in  September  2021,  the  leaders  exchanged  views  on 
shared  interest,  values  and  underlying  principles  on  which  the  QUAD  framework  was 
anchored. The leaders of QUAD shared their perspective on situation in Afghanistan & South 
Asian  region.  Working  groups  on  Infrastructure  coordination,  Cyber  security  and  Space 
coordination were launched to bolster regional infrastructure and exchange satellite data for 
monitoring  climate  change,  disaster  preparedness  and  responding  to  other  challenges.74

With  the  increased  frequency  of  interaction  and  commitment  by  member  states,  leaders 
of  QUAD  have  become  more  aligned  by  a  shared  concerns  on  China’s  increasingly 
assertive behaviour in the region and are more willing to define a productive agenda of 
cooperation which is mutually beneficial.76 As the QUAD leaders embark on a journey of 
close cooperation, one of the most important areas being addressed is the maritime security 
initiative (Indo Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness) that will permit member 
countries to monitor and assess illegal fishing, track dark shipping and perform tactical level 
activities.77  A  major  benefit  of  this  initiative  is  that  it  will  ensure  round  the  clock  virtual 
presence and improve ability to respond to disaster relief and protection of fisheries. 
QUAD  has  a  tremendous  potential  in  the  space  domain.  US  has  dominated  the  space 
historically  and  now  a  key  indicator  of  its  focus  in  the  space  domain  is  visible  with  the 
creation  of  USSPACECOM  and  US  Space  force.  In  addition  to  the  above,  civilian  projects 
which include robotic and human space exploration, human space missions, cislunar system 
and  the  lunar  exploratory  program  are  being  undertaken  to  maintain  its  space  supremacy. 
India also has a mature space program which provides a robust, self-reliant and cost effective 
launch services to foreign countries.78 Its major achievement include the successful conduct 
of ASAT test in 2019 and establishing the Defence Space Agency which has an astropolitical 
and strategic significance in the regional context.79 Japan established the Japanese Aerospace 
Exploration Agency (JAXA)80 in 2003 which serves as a core agency for overall aerospace 
development and utilization. To augment the military space capability, it is in the process of 
creating  a  Domain  Mission  unit  for  protecting  space  assets  and  will  coordinate  with 
USSPACECOM  and  Space  Force.  The  Defence  of  Japan  2021  White  Paper  mentions  a

a new player in the space domain. The Australian Space Agency was created in 2018 before 
which  it  was  dependent  on  the  US  for  all  contributions.  In  December  2021,  the  Australian 
government released a roadmap to develop its space industry with 38 recommendations for 
space infrastructure and services providing a strategic outline to growth of Australian space 
communities having ramifications beyond the space sector. 82 
2.5. Chinese Strategy in the Indo pacific 
Chinese  grand  strategy  is  wielded  through  its  2013  BRI  program  &  recognises  it    as  a 
medium  to  reshape  the  regional  and  international  order  by  building  extensive  infrastructure 
projects  from  Eurasia  to  the  African  continent.  From  the  geopolitical  lens,  Beijing’s  BRI 
strategy  and  the  Washington’s  Indo-Pacific  strategy  constitute  a  strategic  competition 
between  sea  and  land  powers.83  China  has  countered  the  assessment  of  US  experts  by 
proposing  a  concept  of  “community  of  shared  mankind”  by  promoting  the  idea  to  bring 
tangible  economic  benefits  to  the  countries  in  the  Indo  Pacific.84  Chinese  foreign  Ministry 
statement  of  May  22  referred  to  the  American  strategy  being  under  the  banner  of  ‘freedom 
and openness,’ which is keen to "gang up” & create ‘small circles’” in an attempt to contain 
China.85 Beijing’s theatre strategy in the region constitutes the ‘String of Pearls’86 by which it 
plans  to  control  the  strategic  choke  points  in  the  Indian  Ocean  region.  As  part  of  its 
expansionary  move,  Beijing  established  its  first  overseas  military  base  2017  in  Djibouti  to 
make  its  presence  felt  in  the  region.  It    refers  to  its  base  in  Djibouti  as  a  logistics  facility, 
however, it has stationed  PLAN Marines equipped with armoured vehicles and artillery assets.87 
The region as a whole and in particular borders of the Indo-Pacific encompass the maritime 
segment  of  the  BRI  that  holds  importance  for  visualized  21st  Century  Maritime  Silk 
Road.88By establishing overseas bases Beijing seeks to create a global logistics infrastructure 
for expansion & projecting military power in the garb of commercial arrangements to achieve 
its geopolitical goals.89 A similar action can be seen in Chinese military arrangements with 
Cambodia,  which  undermines  the  peaceful  settlement  of  disputes,  maritime  security  and 
freedom of navigation in the ASEAN region. In the South China Sea, PRC claims resources 
by  undermining  sovereign  rights  of  South  Asian  countries  and  in  turn  threatening  the 
shipping lanes. It has not offered any coherent explanation or legal basis for the ‘Nine dashed

2.5.1 Military capability of China & Likely manifestation in the Indo pacific 
The Chinese Army embarked on a journey of military modernization after the Gulf war drawing 
lessons  for  the  modern  day  conflict.  With  an  aim  to  transform  into  a  modern  military  PRC 
undertook  radical  reforms96  to  prepare  itself  for  projecting  beyond  the  borders.  China’s 
defence  expenditure,  at  US$252  billion  (2020),  is  the 2nd  largest  in  the  world and  is 
approximately one-third of the US’s defence spending.97 This increase in defence spending is 
in sync with its long term strategy of becoming a world leader. It has built both offensive and 
defensive  capability  to  secure  the  SLOC  which  are  part  of  the  grand  Maritime  Silk  Route 
project. As part of building a military might and expanding its navy in the blue waters, it is 
focused  to  increase  the  number  of  nuclear  powered  submarines,  aircraft  carriers,  ballistic 
missile launch submarines, and ballistic missile defence to solidify its security concerns in the 
Indo  pacific  region.98The  militarization  of  the  islands  in  South  China  Sea  has  seen  the 
deployment  of  nuclear  powered  submarines  (Shang  I-class),  ballistic  missile  launch 
submarines  (Jin  class  SSBNs)  ,aircraft  carriers  (Liaoning  &  Shandong,  Intercontinental 
ballistic  missiles  (DF-26),  Medium  range  ballistic  missiles  (DF-17)).  Surface  combat 
ships(Type-054A  frigates,  Type-056  corvettes  &  Type-052D  destroyers),  and  combat 
aircrafts.99  PLA  views  Cyber  domain  as  an  important  pillar  of  economic  and  social 
development.  It  carries  out  its  cyber  operations  through  “The  Ministry  of  State  Security 
(MSS)” & “Strategic Support Force (SSF)”100 to through enhanced cyber defence, cyberspace 
situational  awareness,  participating  in  international  cyber  cooperation,  ensuring  national 
information  security  and  maintain  national  security  &  social  stability.101102    SSF  emerged 
from  the  PLA  reorganisation  in  2015  and  is  an  umbrella  force  which  integrates  electronic 
warfare, information warfare and cyber operations to the Integrated Theatre Commands. The 
Chinese  cyberwarfare  allows  multiple  agencies  and  individuals  to  work  towards  disrupting  
adversary’s computer networks to paralyse their decision-making capability during peacetime 
activities  and  during  hostilities.103  Given  the  above  backdrop,  the  likely  manifestation  of 
China in the Indo pacific is hinged on the following two ways as covered below. 

a)  Grey  Zone  Warfare  to  advance  its  interests  for  regional  dominance.  China  employs 
innovative grey zone tactics in the South China Sea, East China Sea and borders with India to 
gain  persistent  indefatigable  advantage.  Table  4.  provides  a  graphical  representation  of  
Chinese grey zone tactics against Taiwan, Vietnam, Philippines, India and Japan.

Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 2022. (https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RBA594-1.html.) 
These  activities  involve  deliberately  pursuing  political  objectives  via  carefully  designed 
operations  below  the  escalatory  thresholds  of  conflict  &  pursue  all  non-military  and  non-
kinetic  tools  such  as  cyber  warfare,  legal  warfare  and  information  warfare.104  China  may 
combine grey zone activities with its “Cabbage Strategy” where islands are surrounded layer 
by layer in a sequence by sending civilian fishing ships in a disputed territory, followed by 
fisheries  patrol  vessels,  then  coast  guard  ships  and  consolidation  by  the  PLAN  warships.105 
China may heighten the grey zone operations along with multiple surrounding of islands and 
involve other stakeholders like the armed militia, government owned vessels, PLAF aircrafts 
and oil rig platforms (which operate with a backup of social media campaigns), GPS & radio 
interference  and  Cyber-attacks.  As  a  culmination  of  the  above  activities,  Beijing  would 
consolidate gains and intend to establish sovereignty over the South China Sea.  
b)  Leveraging  Maritime  Silk  Road  &  Access  denial  capabilities  for  domination.  The 
network  of  facilities  in  the  Maritime  Silk  Road  is  supporting  the  Chinese  commercial 
domain  as  it  aspires  to  build  an  economic  chain  linking  China  with  countries  in  Asia, 
Europe,  Middle  east  and  Africa.  PLA  may  further  consolidate  its  formidable  access  denial 
capabilities in the near seas (From Japan through Philippines till Malacca) and plan to cover vital 
choke  points  between  the  Indian  and  Pacific  ocean  as  part  of  its  long  range  power  projection 
capabilities  (Open  sea  protection).  As  of  2022,  China  has  17  overseas  ports106  out  of  which 
Djibouti in East Africa, Hambantota in Sri Lanka, Gwadar in Pakistan and a deep water port in 
Myanmar  are  important  in  the  context  of  Indo  pacific.  China  may  plan  to  convert 
infrastructure  to  military  facilities  in  no  time  for  power  projection.  The  infrastructure  
can  hold  minimum  provisions  of  medical  store,  rest  &  recreation  facilities, 
communication detachment and ship repair facility to support a naval combat operation. 
A  likely  crisis  scenario  may  emerge  wherein  the  CCP  plans  for  full  projection  of  its  force 
level which entails, mobilization and deployment of PLA forces, enforcement of an Air Defence 
Identification  Zone  (ADIZ)  and  interference  with  enhanced  cyber  &  space  activities.107  The 
strategy  will  involve  Active  Defence108  measures  to  defend  littoral  border  in  the  Phase-I  and 
develop a blue water navy109 capable of power projection in Phase-II.

3. Literature Survey 
Extensive  research  has  been  undertaken  by  identifying  the  authors  and  readings  which 
provide insights into the role of QUAD countries in the geostrategic and security domain, the 
prospects of QUAD in the near future and the perception of Beijing towards QUAD. Also, a 
substantial analysis was attempted in two specific fields where authors have proposed ways 
niche and disruptive technology namely; Artificial Intelligence, Quantum, 5G, Cyber security 
and Nano technology can be leveraged for use. The literature survey is as covered under. 

Bonny  Lin  covers  that  Beijing  draws  a  parallel  between  NATO’s  expansion  in  Europe 
(especially the erstwhile east bloc countries) and US effort in the Indo-pacific to form blocs 
and alliances to counter China. She argues that the Chinese concern is based on the fact that 
an increased support by the US to its regional partners and Taiwan may prove to be a similar 
situation which Russia is facing. She highlights certain lessons Chinese are learning form the 
Ukraine crisis in terms of dangerous expansion by US military activities which motivates it to 
be more self-reliant. Her work is admirable as it provides an insight into the likely shifting 
positions of China in Ukraine and implications for the US. However, it does not cover lessons 
&  options  for  US  in  terms  of  specific  initiatives  in  the  space  and  cyber  warfare  with  the 
countries of Indo pacific.110  Sun Chul Jung et.al. postulates that the US Indo Pacific strategy 
has put the non-Quad Asian states in the strategic dilemma and examines their positions on 
Chinese rise vis a vis Indo Pacific Strategy.111 He asserts that the reason for the QUAD not 
recruiting  new  members  is  due  to  weak  commitment  to  a  liberal  international  order  and 
opposition  due  to  rising  China.  The  authors  reasoning  in  view  of  the  present  structure  of 
QUAD is logical, however the author does not touch on the bilateral ties of the non-QUAD 
countries which may be viewed as a stepping stone to attract these countries for the QUAD 
membership    Mitika  Guha  Sarkar  in  her  work  claims  that  Beijing’s  perception  towards  the 
QUAD is complex and systemic. She attributes Beijing’s response to QUAD is connected to 
US’  rebuilding  Asia  strategy  beyond  military  operations,  re-emergence  of  Japan  in  Asia, 
Australia’s renewed & calculated stand towards China and rise of India. The attribution of the 
author  are  apt,  however,  key  issues  on  the  informality  of  the  alliance  have  not  been 
highlighted which indicates flexible nature of QUAD.112  

Wooeal Paik et.al. in their work explain the goals of a mini-lateral security cooperation while 
focusing  on  the  QUAD.  The  work  considers  the  non-military  cooperation  focused  on 
infrastructure development as a counter measure to the BRI in the Indo Pacific. The authors 
claim that China is using a divide and rule strategy to weaken the mini-lateral bonds between 
the  countries  by  luring  them  away  from  the  US  led  efforts.  According  to  them,  China  is 
partially  fixing  its  ‘Debt  trap  policy’  by  reducing  the  magnitude  of  its  exploitative  political 
and economic interest seeking. 113 The author have highlighted the importance of developing 
infrastructure as an alternative to the BRI, however, the aspect of dual use of infrastructure 
for non-military tasks like disaster management have not been stressed.

Jagannath Panda in his work  highlights the importance for India to look for other sustainable 
non-Chinese  frameworks  like  the  Blue  Dot  network114.  He  argues  that  it  is  a  geopolitical 
necessity as it paves way for an alternate global supply chain network. He also opines that it 
will  strengthen  the  QUAD  process  and  trilateral  frameworks  between  the  countries.115  He 
emphasizes on the importance of developing an alternative supply chain to counter BRI and 
stresses  on  the  developing  frameworks  where  China  is  not  present.  However,  mechanics  of 
bilateral  or  multilateral  framework  or  informal  alliances  in  the  niche  technologies  having  a 
security dimension have not been highlighted. 

Abhijit  Singh  argues  that  for  the  past  few  years,  China  has  been  actively  employing  the 
‘Three warfare’s’ (3Ws) strategy which includes psychological, media, and legal warfare as 
tools to weaken resolve in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region. He claims that although 
the  attacks  have  been  confined  to  Taiwan  and  South  East  Asian  countries  who  have  a 
territorial  disputes  with  China,  but  the  strategy  is  likely  to  be  used  against  India.  He 
recommends  developing  institutional  frameworks,  creating  awareness  for  mitigation, 
focusing on flexible & durable responses and need for pre-empting attacks as per the shifting 
political and military situation.116 The “Active Defence Strategy” and the “Cabbage Strategy” 
undertaken by Beijing in the South China Sea and East China Sea has not been mentioned in 
his work. Also, a brief on the information warfare and cyber capabilities would have given a 
pragmatic view on the way PLA operates. 

Paul  Kallender-Umezi  provides  a  perspective  of  Japanese  focus  on  hi-tech  infrastructure 
which according to him provides an added advantage to have collaboration with the partners 
to  build  competition  against  China.117  Hiroyuki  Suzuki  argues  that,  amid  the  middle  power 
countries like Australia, India, and Indonesia, there are high expectations for Japan to assume 
an  inclusive  leadership  role  in  the  region  owing  to  its  multi-layered  relationships  in  
economic, security and deep cultural ties with the countries of Southeast Asia.118 The authors 
cover  the  aspect  of  Japan  taking  a  lead  in  infrastructure  especially  in  the  ASEAN  region, 
however,  the  specific  domains  in  which  the  collaboration  can  be  undertaken  by  attracting 
these countries has not been accentuated. 
Salvatore  Babones  points  to  the  model  of  Malabar  exercises  to  keep  peace  with  aggressive 
China  manoeuvres.119  He  draws  a  comparison  of  NATO  with  QUAD  and  recommends 
“promotion  of  democratic  values”  and  “peaceful  resolution  of  the  disputes”  as  the  way 
forward  for  QUAD.  However,  undertaking  exercises  in  the  domain  of  Cyber  and  Space

author. 
John Lee et.al propose a democracy led tech ecosystem in the Indo Pacific for winning the 
Geotech  battle  between  the  PRC  and  QUAD  countries.120  The  authors  highlight  creating  a 
competitive  alternate  to  the  Chinese  led  5G  network,  establishing  a  QUAD  free  &  secure 
digital  trade  agreement  and  a  QUAD  innovation  fund.  The  recommendation  by  the  author 
provides a vision for creating an alternative to the Chinese dominated techno space and are 
based on the present underregulating of the use and flow of data. The contribution presents a 
novel idea of setting up of data governance standards and policy coordination for restricting 
the economic involvement of China in the manufacturing sector. Integration of Space domain 
by the QUAD countries via coordinated policies in the field of emerging technologies thereby 
creating  a  competitive  edge  through  research,  development  and  operationalizing  the  space 
framework has not been addressed by the research study.  

Husanjot  Chahal  et  al  assesses  the  existing  AI  collaboration  between  the  QUAD  countries 
and  identifies  AI  related  research  strengths  which  could  be  leveraged  for  joint  research 
opportunities  like  Human  computer  interaction,  data  mining,  linguistic  and  theoretical 
computer  science,  ML  (Machine  Learning)  &  NLP  (Natural  language  processing).  The 
opportunities and path forward presented by the authors are focused toward 1) research which 
include  privacy  preserving  AI  techniques  &  establishment  of  a  Joint  AI  research 
collaboration and 2) investment in the field of AI by incentivizing and growing AI investment 
as  well  as  coordinating  the  investment  screening  &  export  controls  amongst  the  member 
countries.121 Although QUAD offers itself as an alternate to Chinese authoritarian model on 
technology development and use, but different governance approaches, varying technological 
capabilities and deep ties in AI research and investment with China pose barriers for creating 
a  collaboration.  Specific  use  cases  in  the  domain  of  Space  and  cybersecurity  were  areas 
which the authors did not stress upon.  

The  August  2021,  Gateway  House  report  by  QUAD  economy  &  Technology  task  force122 
brought the expert recommendations from industry, politics government and academia in five 
areas Pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, fintech & cyber security, space & 6G and undersea 
communication  cables.  The  task  force  aptly  addresses  the  key  areas  where  an  immediate 
progress  on  economic  and  technological  issues  can  be  made  by  the  QUAD  countries.  The 
study  identifies  the  core  element  of  cybersecurity  as  reliable  hardware  and  highlights  an 
important aspect of lack of global mechanism to detect cyberattacks and assess privacy risks 
to  the  financial  system.  The  recommendations  provided  by  the  task  force  in  cyber  security 
domain  are  on  identifying  the  data  protection  standards,  pushing  the  technology  from  the 
“west” to Indo pacific and on wider accession to the Budapest Convention on cyber security. 
In the field of 6 G and space domain, the task force proposes space based 6G network where 
the  data  transmission  would  take  place  through  aerospace  and  space  platforms.  The

& cellular networks and secure green intelligent communication with integrated sensing. The 
study  mentions  the  lack  of  an  overarching  strategy  akin  to  the  Chinese  “Space  information 
Corridor”  as  part  of  the  BRI.  The  task  force  report  is  comprehensive  and  provides 
recommendations  which  are  of  value,  however  the  specific  aspects  which  needs  to  be 
addressed as part of the collaboration between the QUAD countries in the space domain over 
surveillance, communication and remote sensing have not been addressed. Also, although the 
recommendations on cyber security aspects in the Fintech cover the aspects of protection, but 
the framework in which the cyber security has to be ensured has not been touched upon. 
Lisa  Curtis123  et.al.  provides  an  assessment  on 
the  QUAD  activities  and  policy 
recommendations with respect to trade, economics, and security & defense across six priority 
areas which include vaccine, critical & emerging technologies, climate change, infrastructure, 
space  and  cybersecurity.  In  space  domain,  the  authors  recommend  enhancement  of 
cooperative  mechanisms  to  establish  space  situational  awareness,  training  to  improve 
interoperability and enhance industry collaboration in the space sector. For Cybersecurity, a 
shared  set  of  standards,  multilateral  actions  for  preventing  cyber  asset  exploitation  and 
civilian  workforce  interoperability  have  been  recommended.  Yet,  the  key  aspects  related  to 
space  coordination  by  the  respective  agencies  and  cyber  security  measures  required  for 
mitigating the threats related to space infrastructure has not been amplified by the authors. 
A. Pereira, B. Biddington, R. Rajagopalan and K Suzuki  124 investigates the perspectives on 
the  emerging  geopolitical  aspects  and  its  implication  for  the  space  activities  by  leading 
experts  from  Australia,  India,  and  Japan.  The  study  brings  out  that  out  of  all  countries, 
Australia  is  the  smallest  investor  in  space  activities,  and  it  exports  regime  with  respect  to 
export of space activities is restrictive but is well located to host ground stations. As a middle 
power,  it  can  play  an  important  role  for  stronger  space  regulation,  develop  space  security 
matters, space situational awareness and maritime domain awareness. The authors bring out 
the  importance  of  mission  assurance,  vulnerability  of  space  assets  and  space  governance. 
Setting up of ‘Space Traffic Management’ to prevent accidental and intentional collisions and 
protecting  space-based  assets  for  civil  and  military  purpose  are  of  vital  interest.  The  work 
highlights 
through 
transparency & confidence building measures in which the QUAD countries can collaborate 
on. The author while covering the cyber-attacks on Indian Space Institutions highlights that in 
view of the shift of Indian Space policy as part of the larger strategic policy shift with the rise 
of China, there is a requirement for space dialogues for more concerted efforts in developing 
rules  for  outer  space  activities  and  for  counter  space  capabilities.  The  point  covered  by 
authors  on  timely  access  to  imagery,  strengthened  military  communication  &  surveillance 
during conflict and natural disasters areas is crucial for time sensitive decisions and resource 
allocation. The authors also agree that the present QUAD summit fact sheet does not identify 
space  domain  immersed  with  the  niche  technologies  which  are  deemed  critical  by  all  four 
countries.

Pranay Kotasthane126 judiciously covers the aspect of ‘metacriticality’ of semiconductors in 
the  geopolitical  &  geoeconomics  landscape  and  argues  that  the  QUAD  grouping  is  well 
placed for collaboration due to the comparative advantage which countries enjoy in the field 
of semiconductor supply chain. He highlights that the announcement of establishing working 
group  by  the  QUAD  countries  in  the  critical  &  emerging  technologies  (C&ET)  is  a  way 
forward but indicates that there is a lack of consensus which needs to be built. He argues that, 
although prioritization of specific emerging technologies has been completed, but there is no 
decision on the mechanics of collaboration. The author recommends multilateral cooperation 
as a necessity and draws three apt principles 1) thinking security as an ecosystem by forming 
a QUAD consortium to build semiconductor manufacturing base and cooperate in developing 
new  standards  2)  forming  a  “trust  bubble”  in  semiconductor  partnership  3)  governments  to 
encourage Research & Development, allow preferential access to access for Exploratory Data 
Analysis  (EDA)  tools  to  QUAD  companies  and  increasing  trust  in  legal  enforcement 
mechanism.  The  author’s  work  is  impressive  but  lacks  specific  areas  of  collaboration 
especially in the Cyber-Space domain. 

Jagannath  Panda127  acknowledges  that  the  emerging  technologies  such  as  artificial 
intelligence  (AI),  cloud  computing,  quantum,  robotics  and  blockchain  will  have  a 
transforming effect in the economy and by 2030 add USD 15 trillion to the global economy. 
While highlighting Taiwan as a major hub of technology value chain manufacturing and the 
challenges posed by China, he highlights that the working group can capitalize on advantages 
of  QUAD  members  with  India’s  data  generation  strength,  Japanese  Research  and 
development,  Australia’s  successful  public-private  partnership  and  supercomputing 
capabilities of the US. Although, broad canvas on which the emerging technologies & supply 
chains  needs  to  be  addressed  has  been  recognized,  but  integration  in  the  space  &  cyber 
security domain has not been touched upon. 
Avantika  Menon128  provides  an  authentic  account  of  the  new  space  age  ‘Space  2.0’  and 
prospects  for  collaboration  by  the  QUAD  countries  in  the  emerging  space  domain.  She 
provides  an  insight  into  the  aspect  of  weaponization  in  space  by  covering  the  aspects  of 
kinetic  &  non  kinetic  counter  space  weapons,  electronic  counterspace  weapons  and  cyber-
attacks on the space systems. She cites Malcolm Davis’ assessment that the soft kill weapons 
are ideal for grey zone operations in the orbit and the threat is real. Her work aptly covers the 
focus for QUAD collaboration in Space Situational Awareness (SSA), governance and norms 
in  space  and  development  of  space  solar  power  stations.  The  aspects  in  relation  to 
cybersecurity measures and hardening of ground systems as well as requirement of preparing 
the space assets for a crisis situation in the Indo pacific did not figure out in her work. 

We  conclude  that  considerable  research  work  has  been  carried  out  while  analyzing  the 
QUAD future to counter Chinese aggressive maneuver. Many authors have proposed future 
collaboration in harnessing technology by QUAD counties and comprehensively researched 
the areas of collaboration. However, the research on how the emerging technologies can be 
enmeshed in the space domain has not been undertaken.

4. Synthesis & Recommendations 
4.1 Discussion & Opinion 
We  argue  that  QUAD  countries  have  a  potential  of  managing  the  power  transition 
collectively  by  collaborating  on  common  interests  and  have  a  consensus  on  achieving  a 
higher goal. An alliance which is below the threshold of a formal security alliance but more 
than  a  quasi-framework,  provides  adequate  attraction  for  an  alignment  that  promotes 
cooperation across common interests without retrenching the sovereignty of members. In the 
post  COVID  world  order,  the  ties  between  the  QUAD  nations  would  require  greater 
synergism  between  the  domestic  Indo-Pacific  vision  and  the  QUAD  vision.  This  collective 
security concern over Chinese aggressive gestures should aim to strengthen alternate supply 
chains,  present  a  rule  based  international  order  and  provide  a  foundation  for  an  action 
oriented multilateral institution which covers national interest of all members.129  
For  countries  in  the  Indo  Pacific,  formal  alliances  like  AUKUS  should  not  be  seen  as 
upstaging the QUAD alliance.130 Both QUAD & AUKUS have an agenda of its own which 
suits common interests and together should be seen as a pivot for reconfiguring the balance of 
power in the Indo pacific. 
For US, the challenges stemming out of the IPS require strong harmonised efforts as far as 
the American foreign policy to negotiate with the Indo pacific partners & arrive at a common 
narrative.  The  successful  implementation  of  US  strategy  appears  to  be  delayed  due  to  the 
ongoing  Ukraine  crisis  as  were  prior  administrations  were  involved  in  Middle  east  and 
Afghanistan.  Washington  is  likely  to  face  domestic  political  pressure  on  its  core  interest  in 
the  region  and  its  rhetoric  of  liberal  democratic  institution  will  go  through  a  litmus  test  by 
changed  global  pattern  of  Indo  pacific  partners.131  India  can  draw  benefits  from  the  Indo 
pacific  Region  by  having  strong  relations  with  the  littoral  states.  Being  the  largest 
economy  in  the  region  and  having  a  direct  security  threat  from  China,  it  could  lead  an 
initiative  in  the  maritime  domain  through  the  multilateral  forums  like  the  Indian  Ocean 
Rim Association (IORA) and the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS). It can propose 
additional agendas for collaboration that cover critical areas in the conventional maritime 
security, non-traditional security, geographic research & environmental protection.132 India 
and  Japan  have  confronted  with  China  over territorial  disputes.  China’s  ambassador  to 
Tokyo has publicly criticized Japanese Prime Minister Suga over the claim that, the new 
QUAD  diplomacy  demonstrates  a  “Cold  War  mentality”  and  that  is  “100  percent 
outdated.”133  Japan  under  the  flagship  of  FOIP  is  well  poised  to  engage  other  states  with 
common interests for regional stability and prosperity. Its strategic partnership with Australia 
& India with revision of bilateral ties with the US, makes it more aligned towards a collective 
partnership in the Indo pacific. QUAD partnership is a key pillar of Australian foreign policy 
and it compliments other bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation of the country with 
ASEAN member states and Pacific partners.134

The Maritime Domain Awareness needs further expansion for dealing with a collective threat 
in the Indo Pacific region. This would require augmentation of the existing surveillance setup 
in the region for peace, stability and enhanced cooperation between the QUAD countries & 
ASEAN  in  the  future.  An  integrated  and  fused  output  of  three  critical  areas  namely  South 
East Asia, Indian ocean and pacific islands via fusion centers in India, Singapore, Solomon 
islands  and  Vanuatu135  can  provide  QUAD  countries  the    “QUAD  eyes  and  ears”.  Taking 
into  consideration  the  collective  security  needs  of  the  QUAD  countries  and  domination 
of the contested sea lines of communication, it becomes important to leverage the space 
&  cyber  security  domain  together  to  utilize  advanced  techniques  for  utilization  in  the 
intelligence  gathering.  Space  Domain  Awareness  is  one  area  where  a  credible  deterrence 
needs to be achieved by the QUAD countries. In the recently concluded QUAD summit, the 
four nations discussed about the semiconductor capacity and the supply chain shortcomings 
which may pose a major challenge in the coming future. In the Cyber security domain, the 
responsibilities have been clearly handed over. Australia is in charge of critical infrastructure 
protection, India is responsible for supply chain resilience and security, Japan administering 
work force development & talent and US taking lead of software security standards.136  
China views NATO’s expansion and the western liberal order as a subject of controversy and 
a seed for conflict. Chinese scholars have adopted the term Indo Pacific at regular forums and 
the think tanks in Beijing have even convened conferences with Indo pacific as the theme & 
voiced their concerns as an Asian NATO.137 It sees the extension of support to Taiwan and 
other  partners  especially  in  the  Indo  pacific  as  a  cause  of  confrontation  and  some  authors 
have  pointed  out  that  the  sanctions  which  have  been  posed  by  the  US  &  the  west  against 
Russia  were originally tailor made for China in case it invaded Taiwan.138  
During the Cold War era, US & Soviet union deployed a number of satellites as an umbrella 
of  surveillance  to  monitor  the  naval  forces.139  Over  the  years    the  space  based  surveillance 
has  evolved  itself  as  a  potent  force  multiplier  with  different  payloads  like  high  resolution 
electro-optical  imaging  satellites,  synthetic  aperture  radar  satellites  and  hyperspectral 
satellites.    These  satellites  provide  near  real-time  monitoring  inputs  of  the  objects  in  the 
intended domain and can augment the existing intelligence setup. The emerging model in the 
space domain allows terrestrial and space systems to be integrated. Space based systems are a 
strategic  resource  thus  they  are  not  immune  to  geopolitical  conflicts  and  cyber-attacks  on 
satellites meant to provide services to a particular country could disrupt the infrastructure in 
another  country.  Satellite  systems  originally  were  not  designed  with  cyber  aspects  in  mind. 
They  have  weak  encryption  and  have  dependence  on  legacy  systems  that  cannot  be  easily 
patched. There is a need to learn from the lessons of IT networks and agree on standards for 
developing  a  common  cybersecurity  architecture.140  The  recent  Ukraine  crisis  has

demonstrated that the space sector will be relevant in the geopolitical conflict and new threat 
actors will be targeting the space systems to disrupt critical services.141 
There are number of ways in which hackers can pose a disruptive strategic threat to satellite 
system.  They  could  compromise  the  Ground  control  equipment    by  spoofing  or  injecting 
malware.  A  study  of  Global  Navigation  Satellite  System  (GNSS)142  spoofing  signals  by 
C4AD  identified  9,883  suspected  instances  across  10  locations  that  affected  1,311  civilian 
vessel  navigation  system–GNSS  spoofing  events  across  Russian  federation  143  Low  cost,  
ease of deployment & commercial availability of spoofing technologies, empower states and 
nonstate  actors  to  endanger  global  navigation  safety.144  China  has  been  suspected  of 
offensively acting in satellite attacks. There were 14 reported incidents including disruption 
of  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration network in 2014. Against the QUAD 
nations,  China  has  pursued  an  offensive  cyber  agenda  by  launching  proxies  like  the 
nationalistic  hacking  groups  and  hired  cybercriminals  primarily 
targeting  critical 
infrastructure in the QUAD countries and other nations in the Indo Pacific resulting  in the 
theft  of  business  secrets,  intellectual  property  and  sensitive  information,  and  disruption  of 
critical services.145 
As the satellite operations use open protocols, they offer many vectors for hacking by cyber 
attackers.  Human  factor  and  supply  chains  are  the  main  vulnerabilities  which  can  be 
exploited  by  the  adversary.  Ground  systems  are  the  weak  points  in  the  satellite  system 
architecture which encompass TT&Cs & Satellite Operations Centers to Network Operation 
Centers    through  teleports,  gateways,  &  earth  stations.146The  continued  attacks  demands  a 
revamp  and  hardening  of  existing  satellite  based  communication  architecture  and  ground 
based  command  and  control  system.  It  is  surprising  that  neither  the  space  policy  nor 
cybersecurity  policy  is  prepared  for  the  challenges  in  the  Cyber  Space  Domain.147  Cyber 
threats  &  capabilities  continue  to  proliferate  &  evolve,  so  should  the  QUAD  countries 
especially  United  States  &  India  develop  ability  to  deflect  and  counteract  against  threats  to 
keep satellite protection as a central priority for C4ISR.148  
The  ongoing  Ukraine  war  has  made  Chinese  opinion  more  strong  on  its  view  of  the 
dangerous external environment in view of the US military activities and NATO expansion 
which could lead to a conflict in the Indo-pacific. The message from Beijing is clear in tone 
that any alignment of countries in an formal or informal alliance in the Indo pacific will be 
seen  as  confrontational.  China  insists  on  an  architecture  which  is  hierarchical  in  nature  in

which  political  economic  and  security  interest  are  self-defined  for  projection  of  power.  Till 
the  time  China  can  be  persuaded  to  accept  a  multipolar  order,  Indo  pacific  strategy  will 
remain in its essential role to counterbalance China with QUAD as its nucleus.149  
The Russian invasion of Ukraine witnessed large scale disruption of the communication links 
through satellite modems and showed us the vulnerabilities in the satellite chain which could 
be exploited by an adversary.150 Space & Cyber domains have changed the traditional notions 
of conflict by expanding its range to a global enterprise, creating potential uncertainty thereby 
driving  the  need  for  technological  innovation.151  As  the  space  domain  is  now  central  to 
modern  warfare,  there  is  a  need  to  align  the  effort  for  a  greater  resilience  against  the 
emerging threat & eventually contribute to crisis outcomes in space domain using space 
based  systems.  The  QUAD  countries  need  to  fill  the  vacuum  on  how  cyber  hardened 
satellites spread over large constellations and geographically distributed launch sites can 
be  utilized  as  a  cost-effective  solution  for  improving  the  space-based  surveillance  to 
meet the strategic demands in the Indo Pacific region.

Before  attempting  to  make  recommendations  about  the  QUAD  alliance,  one  aspect  which 
merits  attention  is  that  the  security  bargaining  architecture  and  practical  alliance  proposals 
have  evolved  over  time.  Informality  of  alliances  still  offers  greater  diplomatic  and  security 
benefits to nation states at a less political and economic cost.

Based  on  the  synthesis  and  literature  survey  carried  out,  certain  recommendations  for  the 
QUAD countries are as follows:- (Refer Table 4 above) 
1.  Coordinated  response  to  creation  of  joint  infrastructure.  To  make  the  alliance  more 
effective there would be a requirement to undertake a coordinated role to provide economic 
and development assistance, infrastructure development and promotion of human rights in the 
Indo  pacific  region.  Considering  defence  and  cooperation  in  infrastructure  development  as 
the most plausible avenues for tighter QUAD bonding, working groups in these areas would 
serve as the foundation for further activity.152 QUAD should evolve a plan to integrate and 
put  a  balanced  development  in  the  Indo  pacific  as  the  top  agenda  for  consultative 
engagement.  The  “Blue  Dot  Network,”  announced  in  2019  as  an  initiative  of  the  U.S. 
Overseas  Private  Investment  Corporation  (OPIC),  Japan  Bank  of  International  Cooperation 
(JBIC),  and  the  Australian  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  (DFAT)  provides  a 
perfect  platform  to  realize  effective  infrastructure  development  element  of  QUAD.  Special 
projects  like  creation  of  ports,  dockyards.  repair  facilities,  airfields  and  communication 
centres  should  be  conceptualized  by  the  QUAD  countries  to  strengthen  the  interoperability 
and interdependence between them.  These facilities should be made for a dual purpose  to 
cater for peace time activities as well as to sustain forces during wartime.  
2.  Research  collaboration  in  niche  technologies.  An  umbrella  of  surveillance  to  jointly 
monitor  the  movements  of  shipping  vessels  in  the  Indo  Pacific  has  been  announced  in  the 
recently  concluded  QUAD  summit  in  May  2022.  This  will  involve  use  of  commercial 
satellites  to  check  dark  shipping,  illegal  fishing,  smuggling  and  piracy  within  the  maritime 
boundaries  of  the  countries.  The  fusion  centres  will  undertake  the  collation  and  analysis  of 
information,  it  will  help  in  detecting  any  tactical  activities  which  the  PLAN  undertakes.  A 
recommended  way  forward  is  to  take  research  collaborations  in  the  niche  technologies  like 
to  address  problems  of 
technology  and  cyber  security  specifically 
AI,  Quantum 
communication  delays,  data  processing  and  prediction  of 
the 
threats.  Leveraging 
technological  research  into  practical  application  for  operational  use  like  use  of  AI/ML  for 
contextual  analysis  in  imagery  intelligence  will  help  better  prediction  and  decision  making. 
Member countries should also elevate areas of strategically important science & technology 
collaborations  for  sustained 
investment.  A  functional  collaboration  with  enhanced 
interoperability and interdependence is required in the areas of ISR (intelligence, surveillance

and reconnaissance), maritime security, logistic support (both near & abroad) encompassing 
civil military defence & industrial sector. 
3. Joint Exercises in Cyber and Space domain. QUAD should aim at accelerating cooperation 
where  already  multilateral  framework  exists  especially  in  the  Maritime  domain.  Two  cost-
effective ways to do this would be, Firstly to enhance interoperability and jointness through 
an expanded defence exercises and wargaming in the “cyber and space domain” akin to the 
Malabar  exercises153  but  increased  in  scope  to  paint  realistic  scenarios  in  these  domains. 
Secondly, specially nominated experts in the Cyber and space domain should undergo joint 
training on countering cyber-attacks. The exercises and joint training will help in developing 
joint  capability  and  foster  trust  &  familiarity  between  countries  against  Chinese  Cyber 
Warfare. 
4.  Launch  low  cost  regional  satellite  constellation.  Use  of  low  cost  miniature  satellites 
constellations complemented by government support in responsive space launch capabilities 
can increase the foot print of countries to match the growing assertion of China. Australia can 
offer  the  launch  centre’s  at  Nhulunbuy  in  Northern  Australia  being  closer  to  equator  & 
Whaler’s  bay  (South  Australia)  to  support  the  space  launches  of  QUAD  countries.  Options 
for  collaboration  in  looking  beyond  immediate  LEO  and  near  earth  GEO  orbits,  should  be 
undertaken by the QUAD.154 The manufacturing of the satellites should be undertaken with a 
regional  homegrown  electronics  ecosystem.  Due  consideration  to  the  supply  chain  risk 
management  should  be  given  and  all  critical  components  should  be  developed  in  a  Joint 
fabrication facility backed by funding from QUAD. 
5.  Regional  Space  Security  Working  Group.  To  preserve  the  collective  interests  of  the 
countries  and  enhanced  security  framework  in  space,  there  is  a  need  to  create  a  ‘Space 
Security Working Group’.  The leading space countries like India and US should collaborate 
and  develop  a  consensus  on  extending  integrated  security  in  the  space  domain.155  New 
generation  satellite  players  are  seeking  to  offset  the  associated  problems  due  to  loss  of  a 
single  satellite.  Satellite  miniaturization,  laser  communication,  small  satellite  constellation 
when  employed  could  deter  a  counterattack  in  space  due  to  high  cost  of  launching  a  DA 
(Direct  Ascent)  ASAT  will  exceed  tactical  value  of  a  missile  attack  for  destroying  a  single 
satellite.  The  concept  of  Operationally  Responsive  Space  (ORS)  can  be  a  key  stone 
technology  which  uses,  reusable  launch  vehicles,  satellite  prepositioning  near  launch  sites 
and a multidomain launch effort from land, air, and sea.  
6. Robust Integrated Cyber & Space Infrastructure. QUAD should recognize the importance 
of  cyber  and  space  as  a  collective  identity  for  hardening  the  space  systems  against  cyber-
attacks.  An  infrastructure  for  information  sharing  for  the  security  &  resiliency  of  the  space 
systems  and  an  interagency  risk  management  structure  should  be  established.  A  cyber 
security  framework  can  be  used  for  profiling  that  helps  to  communicate  the  existing  cyber 
security posture and organize cyber security related tasks. This framework should be used to 
establish  scope  &  priorities,  orient  &  create  a  current  profile  in  Phase-I  and    undertake  a 
thorough  risk  assessment,  target  profiling  and  gaps  determination  in  the  Phase-II.156  Threat

intelligence & best practices from engineering and cyber experts of regional industries from 
manufacturing,    launch  services  &  orbit  operations  should  be  integrated.  Also,  for  building 
international  consensus  on  security  of  space  systems,  explicit  amendments  to  norms  using 
Article 7 of Outer Space Treaty should be considered by QUAD members.  
4.2.1 Limitations 
Although  the  research  reached  its  intended  aim  of  recommending  policy  decisions  for  the 
QUAD  as  an  informal  alliance  especially  in  the  cyber-space  domain,  there  were  some 
limitations  to  the  study  undertaken.  Firstly,  a  detailed  analysis  on  the  extension  of  QUAD 
alliance beyond the Indo Pacific region was not undertaken due to limited scope & paucity of 
time. Secondly, the deterrence options with the QUAD countries in terms of nuclear strategic 
stability  was  not  discussed.  The  growth  potential  and  scope  of  collaboration  has  been 
extensively covered, however due to the divergent threat perception by the QUAD countries 
in terms of absence of territorial disputes (Except India), varying national priorities and risks 
of  retaliation  by  China  does  not  make  the  prospects  of  states  for  effective  cooperation,  a 
smooth  sail.  A  future  research  may  be  undertaken  on  the  aspects  of  semiconductor  supply 
chain  affecting  the    development  of  defence  systems  and  prospects  of  civil  defence  fusion 
through QUAD. 
5. Conclusion  
In this paper, we considered the importance of informal alliance’s in the present geopolitical 
environment and examined the motives of QUAD countries & growing Chinese assertiveness 
in the Indo Pacific region. The opinions brought a clarity on the convergence and need for an 
arrangement  to  defend  key  interests  of  the  member  countries  due  to  growing  security 
concerns in the region.  An extensive literature survey was carried out with a focus on two 
critical areas of cyber and space domain to identify certain gaps in the studies carried out. A 
major  observation  derived  from  the  survey  was  that  the  present  studies  focus  on  cyber  and 
space domains exclusively but do not focus on the Cyber-Space collectively as an important 
field.  We  furnished  key  policy  recommendations  keeping  in  mind  the  present  challenges 
which  the  QUAD  countries  face  geopolitically.  Certain  limitations  while  carrying  out  the 
study have also been summarized along with prospects of related future work. In the years to 
come, it is predicted that the QUAD countries will strengthen their stand in the Indo pacific 
in  a  more  concrete  manner.  QUAD  will  have  to  work  out  a  detailed  plan  for  enhanced 
security  cooperation  with  ASEAN  countries  like,  South  Korea,  Vietnam,  Indonesia  and  the 
Philippines. Although, these countries are less likely to join a collective security framework 
against  China  but  it  is  in  the  interest  of  the  Indo  Pacific  region  to  pay  greater  attention  for 
enhancing  economic  cooperation  with  these  countries  to  present  an  alternative  to  Chinese 
investments. US needs to take advantage of the present global focus on Ukraine to strengthen 
Taiwan’s international standing in terms of its sovereignty, defensive capacity and resilience. 
The fighting capability of Ukraine has proven its worth and has set the tone for countries like 
Taiwan to protect its own sovereignty through self-defence. QUAD can include Taiwan in the 
existing  framework  and  expand  efforts  to  strengthen  Taiwan’s  defensive  mechanism  by 
providing ready reserves, platforms, network security, energy and transportation along with 
civil  defence  planning.  Indo  Pacific  region  would  certainly  be  at  the  center  stage  to  global 
peace and prosperity in the near future. The Ukraine crisis has demonstrated that the alliances 
still hold importance as far as the security and regional stability of the countries is concerned 
and thus, makes QUAD countries more determined in their resolve to counter China.
