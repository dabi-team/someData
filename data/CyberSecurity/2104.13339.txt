Abstract. This paper proposes a new event-based parameter switching
method for the control tasks of cybersecurity in the context of preventive
and reactive cyber defense dynamics. Our parameter switching method
helps avoid excessive control costs as well as guarantees the dynamics
to converge as our desired speed. Meanwhile, it can be proved that this
approach is Zeno-free. A new estimation method with adaptive time
windows is used to bridge the gap between the probability state and
the sampling state. With the new estimation method, several practical
experiments are given afterwards.

Introduction

With the rapid development of internet technology (IT) and internet of things
(IoT) technology, cybersecurity issues are attached more and more importance
these years due to people’s increasing reliance on internet. About 2 million to 5
million computers worldwide suﬀered from malware (are infected with malware)
every day, estimating by the domestic network security company Jinshan in 2016.
Cybersecurity, as a new subject for research, has received extensive attention
from the academic community.

The emerging research ﬁeld ’cybersecurity dynamics’ [25,26] is an interdis-
ciplinary ﬁeld, conceived from the methodology of several early studies in bi-
ological epidemiology (e.g., [18,13,3,1,7]) and its variants in cyber epidemiology
(e.g., [11,12,21,19]),interacting particle systems [15], and microfoundation in eco-
nomics [8]. Diﬀerent from the classical researches oriented to speciﬁc tools, such
as Cryptography and Database Security, cybersecurity dynamics studies the of-
fensive and defensive models under various circumstances from a whole-network
perspective.

1.1 Our Contributions

In this paper, we investigate how to control the evolution of cybersecurity dy-
namics more eﬃciently and eﬀectively in the context of preventive and reactive
cyber defense dynamics, and guarantee its globally convergence to a safe state.
When it comes to the control problem of the highly nonlinear network dy-
namics system, the traditional method is to use a single control strategy, that
is, to adjust the dynamic parameters and maintain them, so that the security
dynamics of the network space converges to a safe state globally. However, main-
taining a high level of dynamic defense strategy may result in high control costs.
Such excessive prevention and control will lead to a waste of control resources
to some extent, and may even have negative eﬀects on the stable operation of
the network systems.

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an event-based parameter
switching approach to save control resources and control the evolution of cyber-
security dynamics in a decentralized manner. It is also proved that this approach
is Zeno-free, that is, it will not fall victim to the Zeno behavior. Numerical ex-
amples show that the maintenance hours of high-cost control strategies can be
reduced by more than 40% with our parameter switching approach.

In addition, this paper provides an estimation method to bridge the gap be-
tween the probability state and the sampling state when using the method in
practice. Diﬀerent from the equilibrium state estimation problem[16], the event-
based control method requires considering the timeliness of probability estima-
tion. A new adaptive estimation method is proposed to verify the eﬀectiveness
of the event-based parameter switching method in the control process through
numerical examples.

1.2 Related Work

Similar event-based methods have been employed in many other application
settings before (see, for example, [2,23,6]). In practical application, one of the
essential problems is that this method should not fall victim to the Zeno behav-
ior, which can lead to inﬁnitely many events within a ﬁnite period of time, thus
invalidate the method [10]. The importance of assuring Zeno-freeness in event-
triggered control is witnessed by a body of literature, including [23,9,24,4].

The ﬁrst cybersecurity dynamics model was proposed in [14]. Ten years later,
[31] demonstrated that a certain class of cybersecurity dynamics is globally con-
vergent in the entire parameter universe, which laid a foundation for our fur-
ther research. The notion of cybersecurity dynamics, as discussed in [25,26], has
opened the door to a new research ﬁeld.

The preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics is a particular kind of
cybersecurity dynamics. Several other kinds of cybersecurity dynamics have been
demonstrated in early studies, such as the models aiming to accommodate adap-
tive defenses [29], active defenses [30,27,17], and proactive defenses [5]. It is worth
mentioning that the event-based parameter switching method may be extended
and applied to the various kinds of dynamics.

1.3 Paper Outline

In Section 2, we brieﬂy review the preventive and reactive cyber defense dynam-
ics model and its global convergence in the entire parameter universe [31]. And
then we state the problems we addressed in this paper. In Sections 3, we present
an event-based parameter switching method for controlling the cybersecurity
dynamics, and prove the eﬀectiveness of the control method (without Zeno be-
havior). In Section 3.4, we present numerical examples on the theoretical model.
Then in Section 4, we show how to apply this event-based parameter switch-
ing method in practice by bridging the gap between the probability-state in the
theoretical model and the sample-state in practice, using an stochastic process
method with adaptive time windows. In Section 5, we conclude the paper with
open problems.

2 Problem Statement

2.1 Review of Preventive and Reactive Defense Dynamics

As a particular kind of cybersecurity dynamics, the preventive and reactive de-
fense dynamics model is ﬁrst introduced in [14],and the convergence properties
of the dynamics is studied in [28] . Later [31] fully analyzed the convergence is-
sues, not only considered the common situation with node homogeneity (i.e., the
parameters are node-independent), but also a more general situation with node
heterogeneity (i.e., the parameters are nodes-dependent). The paper proved that
this dynamics model is globally convergent in the entire parameter universe, that
is, there is always a unique equilibrium, whose exact value (or position) depends
on the speciﬁc parameter values instead of the initial state of the dynamics.

In the preventive and reactive defense dynamics model, we consider two
classes of defenses: preventive defenses and reactive defenses, and two classes
of attacks: push-based attacks and pull-based attacks.

Suppose that the attack-defense interaction occurs over an attack-defense
graph structure G = (V, E), where V is the vertex set representing computers
and (u, v) ∈ E means computer u can directly attack computer v using push-
based attack strategy (i.e., the communication from u to v is allowed by the
security policy). G can be derived from the security policy of a networked system
and the physical network in question. Without loss of generality, we do not make
any restrictions on the structure of G (e.g., G may be directed or undirected).
Denote the adjacency matrix of G by A = [avu]n×n, where avu = 1 if and only
if (u, v) ∈ E. Since the model aims to describe the attacks between computers,
we set avv = 0. Let Nv = {u ∈ V : (u, v) ∈ E}.

In this paper, we consider the continuous-time model described in [31]. At any
time point, a node v ∈ V is in one of two states: “0” means secure but vulnerable,
or “1” means compromised. Let sv(t) and iv(t) be the probability that v is secure
and compromised at time t respectively. It is obvious that sv(t) + iv(t) = 1, sv(t)
and iv(t) explain the term probability-state.

4

Z. Liu et al.

For a node v ∈ V at time t, let θv,1→0(t) abstract the eﬀectiveness of the
reactive defenses and θv,0→1(t) abstract the capability of attacks against the
preventive defenses. βv ∈ (0, 1] represents the probability that the compromised
computer v changes to the secure state because the attacks are detected and
cleaned up by the reactive defenses. Then, θv,1→0(t) = βv. Let αv ∈ [0, 1] denote
the probability that the secure computer v becomes compromised despite the
presence of the preventive defenses (i.e., the preventive defenses are penetrated
by the pull-based attacks). And let γuv ∈ (0, 1] denote the probability that a
compromised computer u wages a successful attack against a secure computer v
despite the preventive defenses (i.e., the preventive defenses are penetrated by
push-based attacks), where (u, v) ∈ E. Under the assumption that the attacks
are waged independent of each other, it holds that

θv,0→1(t) = 1 − (1 − αv)

(cid:0)1 − γuviu(t)(cid:1).

Notice that system (2) is globally stable (i.e., there exists a unique equilibrium
i∗ ∈ [0, 1]n such that every trajectory of system (2) converges to i∗) no matter
whether the parameters are nodes-dependent or nodes-independent [31]. If the
parameters of the network system are nodes-independent (i.e., αv = α, βv = β
for any v ∈ V and γuv = γ for any u, v ∈ V , (u, v) ∈ E), the global convergence
of system (2) can be summarized as follows:

– If the attacker wages both push-based and pull-based attacks on some nodes
v ∈ V (i.e., αv > 0 for some nodes v ∈ V ), system (2) is globally convergent
in the entire parameter universe and the dynamics converges to a unique
nonzero equilibrium exponentially.

– If the attacker only wages push-based attacks (i.e., αv = 0 for any nodes
v ∈ V ), system (2) is still globally convergent in the parameter universe but
the convergence speed depends on all the model parameters (βv, γuv) and
the largest eigenvalue λA,1 of adjacency matrix A.

In this paper, we need to control the dynamics with nodes-dependent param-
eters converging to equilibrium zero. Despite the complexity of nodes heterogene-
ity, we can still take advantage of the convergence properties of the dynamics
with nodes-independent parameters.

2.2 Problem Statement: Controlling Cybersecurity Dynamics

In this paper, we focus on controlling the convergence process of the cyberse-
curity dynamics model in a decentralized control manner, which means that we

An Event-based Method for Controlling Cybersecurity Dynamics

only need to observe the state of the target node v during the control process
of v, with no need to observe the states of its neighbors within the network.
For every node v of the network, we need to control iv(t) converging to zero at
our target convergence speed with relatively low control cost by switching its
parameter βv according to our control rule.

Before presenting the control method, we need to ﬁnish two pre-control steps
to assure the eﬀectiveness of our method. As introduced before, we need to
control the preventive and reactive defense dynamics converging to equilibrium
zero globally. So ﬁrstly, as discussed above, we need to force the parameter
αv = 0 for each node v, which means that the threats of pull-based attacks are
eliminated after the ﬁrst step of the control process (e.g., connections between
some compromised websites and the network system in which the pull-based
epidemic spreading takes place are all cut oﬀ). This is the ﬁrst step of the pre-
control process. Then the corresponding push-based dynamics model we focus
on can be rewritten as:

div(t)

= fv(i) = −βviv(t) +

1 −

(cid:20)

(cid:89)

(cid:0)1 − γuviu(t)(cid:1)

(cid:21)
(cid:0)1 − iv(t)(cid:1).

(3)

u∈Nv

As for βv, we select two reactive defense strategy with diﬀerent control cost
for our parameter switching method, including one relatively strict defense strat-
egy with higher control cost, denoted by β+, and one relatively relaxed de-
fense strategy with lower control cost, denoted by β−. Then we apparently have
β+ > β−. These two strategies should satisfy the conditions that they are both
able to make the dynamics converge to equilibrium zero. The key diﬀerence be-
tween them is, comparing to our target convergence speed with regard to the
dynamics to be controlled, the dynamics with βv = β+ should converge faster
than the target speed for all nodes in V , while the dynamics with βv = β− may
converge more slowly than the target speed.

The classical approach to control the dynamics through adjusting the re-
active defense strategy is the trivial method that forcing βv = β+ during the
entire control process, which is ineﬃcient because it may cost too many defense
resources to maintain the relatively strict reactive defense strategy. Besides, the
convergence speed of the dynamics under high-cost control may be faster than
what we actually need, causing redundancies and wastes of defense resources to
some extent.

As discussed above, both the relatively strict defense strategy and the rel-
atively relaxed defense strategy need to be able to make the dynamics con-
verge to equilibrium zero. So a safe method to get equilibrium zero is to let
βv/γmax ≥ λA,1 for both βv = β+ and βv = β−, where γmax denotes the max-
imum value of probability γuv for all neighbor nodes pair (u, v) ∈ E. But due
to the variety of parameter γuv, γmax can be relatively large in practice, leav-
ing little choice for parameter βv. Therefore, the second step of the pre-control
process is to force γmax to a relatively small value, which means we need to
permanently reinforce the preventive defense strategy for the nodes which are

6

Z. Liu et al.

more vulnerable to push-based attacks launched by the attacker (e.g., a stronger
network ﬁrewall or ﬁlter is deployed).

After the two pre-control steps, in which all the pull-based attacks have been
eliminated and γmax is relatively small, we now employ an parameter switching
method to control the convergence speed with relatively low cost of defense
resources. We use an event-based mechanism to deﬁne the cost-saving parameter
switching rule.

2.3 Notations

Table 1 summarizes the major notations used in the paper.

3 An Event-based Parameter Switching Method

In this section, we initiate an event-based parameter switching method to control
the convergence speed to our target speed, with relatively low cost of defense
resources. That is to say, we switch the reactive defense strategy between two
predeﬁned settings in practice, according to the event-based trigger rule we pro-
posed. We ﬁrst show that the global dynamics under control will converge to
equilibrium zero at our target convergence speed. Then we prove that there is
no Zeno behavior during the entire control process.

3.1 Designing Event-based Parameter Switching Rule

We apply the control method on all nodes of the network system. But for the
purpose of clariﬁcation, we focus on one target node v to explain the control
process corresponding to the decentralized control manner as discussed above.
We switch the parameter βv of the target node v between two diﬀerent groups
of parameters alternately, which are the low-cost parameter βv = β− and the
high-cost parameter βv = β+. Here the footnotes ’lc’ stands for ’low cost’ and
’hc’ stands for ’high cost’. We use T v
+ respectively to denote the total
time of maintaining the two parameters β− and β+ during the entire control
process for node v ∈ V . We want the dynamics to converge to zero at target
convergence speed with a relatively low total cost, which means to make the
mean of time ratio 1

relatively small.

Before deﬁning the event-trigger rule, let us review these deﬁnition and

For all nodes v ∈ V , let n∗n real matrix K = {γuv}n

u,v=1, where γvv = 0 for all
nodes v ∈ V , and let non-singular n ∗ n real diagonal matrix B = diag({βv}n

Notice that βv takes values in {β−, β+} for all nodes v ∈ V . Let B+ = β+In and
B− = β−In, where In is n ∗ n identity matrix. Then we have following lemma.

Apparently, our target convergence speed should be faster than the dynamics
with βv = β− for all nodes in V , and slower than the dynamics with βv = β+
for all nodes in V . We can set our target convergence speed as Ce−ιt as long as
ι > 0 satisﬁes Lemma 1, where C is a positive constant number. We will prove
the eﬀectiveness later.

In our event-based parameter switching method, we switch the parameter βv
when an event is triggered (e.g. certain conditions are satisﬁed). Between two
consecutive events, the parameter βv holds. We deﬁne two criterion functions
according to our target speed of the convergence process:




ϕup(t) = e−ιt, ∀t ≥ 0,



ϕlow(t) = L ∗ e−ιt, ∀t ≥ 0.

where L is an positive constant number satisfying 0 < L < 1. Notice that ϕup(t)
represents the ideal convergence process at our target convergence speed. Theo-
retically, ϕup(t) can be a polynomial function if the original dynamics converge
polynomially. But from the Sard’s Lemma in [22], the parameter regime that
causing polynomial convergence speed is in a zero measure set and cannot be
chosen in practice. So without loss of generality, we let ϕup(t) be an exponential
function for the simpliﬁcation of narrative. It is also worth noting that ϕlow(t)
can be deﬁned in other functional form (only need to satisfy the conditions of
convergence speed).

With the matrix P deﬁned in Lemma 1, we now deﬁne rigger rule as follows:

3.2 Analyzing the Event-based Parameter Switching Method

Under the control procedure proposed above, we will prove the eﬀectiveness of
the event-based parameter switching method, that is, the new dynamics of the
target node under control will converge to zero at our target convergence speed,
and what’s more important, with no Zeno behavior.

Theorem 1. For any node v ∈ V , system (4) (5) generated by the event-based
parameter switching control strategy (trigger rule Deﬁnition 1) will converge to
zero at the convergence speed same as ϕup(t), with no Zeno behavior.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove that mv(t) = p−1
strategy (trigger rule Deﬁnition 1) could never exceed ϕup(t) after time τ v
all nodes v ∈ V (i.e., it always holds that p−1
1 ).

According to the event-based trigger rule Deﬁnition 1, the reactive defense
strategy switches to high-cost setting β+ right after time point t∗. Recall Lemma
1, J = B+ − K − ιIn is a monotone matrix (M-matrix) and [(−J)P + P T (−J)]
is negative deﬁnite, which leads to

(cid:12)
(cid:12)t=t∗

This implies that mv∗ (t)e ιt = p−1

v iv∗ (t)e ιt is strictly decreasing after time
point t∗. In the mean time, notice that ϕup(t)e ιt = 1, and mv∗ (t∗) = ϕup(t∗).
Finally we have mv(t) ≤ ϕup(t) for all nodes v ∈ V at any time point t.

Next we prove that the parameter switching events will continue to exist till
inﬁnite time. That is to say, t → +∞ implies k → +∞ for both {tv
k} and {τ v
k }
(i.e., there are inﬁnitely many parameter switching events). Besides, we prove
that there is no Zeno behavior during the entire control process.

For the convenience of clariﬁcation, let e −tS v

+(t) be the convergence speed of

Now we prove that there is no Zeno behavior in the low-cost control step

That is to say, there is no Zeno behavior in the low-cost control step (5) during

From the proof above, we have shown that mv(t) = p−1

v iv(t) continues to
touch ϕup(t) but could never exceed ϕup(t) till inﬁnite time, so iv converges to
zero at the convergence speed same as ϕup(t) (the convergence speed here refers
to the average speed through time).

Note that the proof under periodic reference setting (see also [16]) is similar.

3.3 Translating Trigger Rule in Deﬁnition 1 to Algorithm

In order to employ the parameter switching control method presented above,
we need to translate the event-based trigger rule in Deﬁnition 1 into a control
algorithm. For this purpose, we need to observe the states of nodes ﬁrst. Due to
the node heterogeneity (i.e., the parameters are nodes-dependent) of the network
system in this paper, the event-based observing method proposed in [16] is no
longer applicable, so we simply use the classical periodic observing method to
handle this issue. Besides, with respect to the decentralized control manner of
the parameter switching method, we illustrate the algorithm by focusing on one
target node v ∈ V .

There are four groups of inputs in Algorithm 1: attack-defense graph G =
(V, E); initial values iv(0) for node v ∈ V ; two criterion functions ϕup(t) and
ϕlow(t); two reactive defense strategies with their corresponding parameter val-
ues β+ and β− and a step length parameter h (i.e., the constant time interval of
the periodic observing method, see also [16]).

3.4 Numerical Examples

We use numerical examples to illustrate the convergence process of the dynamics
under control. The numerical examples exhibit the the eﬀectiveness of the pro-
posed event-based parameter switching method. The settings of the examples
are deﬁned as follows.

For graph G in the dynamics model, we conduct experiments on both undi-
rected graph and directed graph to put the method into practice. The following
network structures are obtained from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ Note
that the extraction of G in practice demands access to the enterprise’s physi-
cal network topologies and security policies, which are usually conﬁdential data
unavailable to academic researchers.

– Enron email network: This is an undirected graph with |V | = 5242 nodes,

|E| = 28980 edges, maximal node degree 81 and λA,1 = 45.6167.

– Gnutella peer-to-peer network: This is a directed graph with |V | = 8, 717
nodes, |E| = 31, 525 links, maximal node in-degree 64 and λA,1 = 4.7395.

We set β+ = 0.8, β− = 0.1 with respect to βv for all nodes v ∈ V . As for γv, we
randomly select the values for all nodes v ∈ V with an upper bound γmax = 0.002
for undirected Enron email network and γmax = 0.013 for directed Gnutella
peer-to-peer network. With respect to the criterion functions {ϕup, ϕlow} of the
event-based trigger rule Deﬁnition 1, we set ι = 0.5 and L = 0.5 for both
undirected Enron email network and directed Gnutella peer-to-peer network.
Thus, the conditions of the parameter switching method proposed above are
satisﬁed. We calculate the matrix P = diag({pv}n
v=1) in Lemma 1 for each graph
respectively. As for the initial values, each node v ∈ V is assigned with an initial
compromise probability iv(0) ∈R [0, 1] where ∈R means sampling uniformly at
random. Besides, we consider t ∈ [0, 500] with a ﬁxed step-length h = 0.025. The
convergence processes of dynamics are shown in Figure 1. Notice that the grey
curve (i.e., the dynamics under control) refers to iv(t), while the the blue curve
(i.e., the adjusted control target) refers to mv(t) = p−1
v iv(t). Figure 1 exhibits
the control process of the proposed event-based parameter switching method and
is consistent with the proof of Theorem 1. Then we verify that the convergence
speed (i.e., the average convergence speed through time) of the dynamics under
control is close to the target speed given by the criterion function ϕup. In order
to conﬁrm the result, we deﬁne the following indicator of convergence speed and
name it exponential speed index:

S(t) = −

1
∆t

ln

i(t + ∆t)
i(t)

.

Notice that the exponential speed index of the criterion function is equal to
ι = 0.5 in our settings, which also represents the target speed index. The expo-
nential convergence speed indexes of the dynamics i(t) = [i1(t), · · · , in(t)] under
parameter switching control for both undirected and directed graph are shown
in Figure 2. Notice that the value of the blue line S refers to the whole time
average of the green curve for t ∈ [0, 500] and should be close to the red line
(i.e., the target speed index).

ι = 2.60%, which shows the eﬀectiveness.
Next, it comes to the control cost, which is indicates by the mean of time ratio

. For the classical control approach without parameter switching,
n
it holds that βv = β+ for t ∈ [0, 500] for all nodes v ∈ V . Suppose the control
cost is equal to 1. From the experiments, by using the event-based parameter
switching method, the control cost is equal to 0.50 in the case of undirected
Enron email network and 0.53 in the case of directed Gnutella peer-to-peer

network respectively. That is to say, the new control method should save at
least 40% of the cost incurred by the classical approach. So we conclude that
the event-based parameter switching method can reduce more than 40% of the
control cost compared with the classical approach, which shows the eﬃciency.

4 Putting the Event-based Method into Practice

Similar to [16], we need to bridge the gap between the following two kinds
of states for utilizing the event-based parameter switching control method in
practice. In the aforementioned model, the state of node v ∈ V at time t is
represented by iv(t), namely the probability that v is in compromised state at
time t. In practice, this state is often measured as a Boolean value, with “0”
indicating v is secure but vulnerable and “1” indicating v is compromised. In
other words, the sample-state of node v ∈ V at time t can be denoted by

χv(t) =

(cid:40)
0
1

v is in the secure state at time t
v is in the compromised state at time t.

(7)

This diﬀerence underlines the gap between the probability-states in the model
and the sample-states in practice.

It is worth noticing that, the algorithm proposed in [16], which estimates the
probability-states via 0-1 state ergodic process, can not be simply transferred
and applied to the current control problem. Unlike the equilibrium estimation
task in which the accuracy of estimation is of vital importance, the timeliness
is the main focus in our event-based parameter switching dynamics control.
Without the timeliness, the event triggered by rule may suﬀer from time lag
, which could invalidate the event-based control method. So despite the 0-1
state sequences over the whole time (i.e., [0, t]) may provide higher accuracy
of probability estimation, yet we should avoid using them in the present task.
Instead, we propose a new algorithm which takes advantage of 0-1 state sequences
within a time window.

4.1 Estimation via 0-1 State Sequences within a Time Window

Motivated by the theorem of two-valued processes introduced in [20, Chapter 1],
we propose a new method to bridge the aforementioned gap by obtaining an
estimation (cid:100)iv(t) of probabilities iv(t) and an estimation (cid:91)sv(t) of probabilities
sv(t) from a 0-1 state sequence within a time window, as indicated by (7). We
design a new algorithm for the event-based parameter switching method from
the theorem.

Firstly, let us review the theorem of two-valued processes. We use the Lebesgue

measure M to deﬁne






Tv0(t) = M(cid:0)(cid:8)τ ≤ t : χv(τ ) = 0(cid:9)(cid:1)
Tv1(t) = M(cid:0)(cid:8)τ ≤ t : χv(τ ) = 1(cid:9)(cid:1).

(8)

An Event-based Method for Controlling Cybersecurity Dynamics

17

Theorem 2 below shows how to generate probabilities (cid:100)iv(t) and (cid:91)sv(t) from a 0-1
state ergodic process over time.

Theorem 2 ([20]). Let {χv(t), t > 0} for v ∈ V be a 0-1 state ergodic process.
Let






(cid:91)sv(t) =

(cid:100)iv(t) =

Tv0(t)
t
Tv1(t)

,

then it is obvious that limt→+∞
1(cid:1) − (cid:100)iv(t)(cid:3) = 0.

(cid:2)P(cid:0)χv(t) = 0(cid:1) − (cid:91)sv(t)(cid:3) = 0, limt→+∞

(cid:2)P(cid:0)χv(t) =

In [16], (cid:100)iv(t) and (cid:91)sv(t) is used to estimate iv(t) and sv(t) at suﬃciently large
time t respectively. However, as the time-averaged estimations of probability
state, (cid:100)iv(t) and (cid:91)sv(t) suﬀer from an increasing time lag as t → ∞. Due to the
convergence property of the preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics,
the time-averaged estimation still converges to the original equilibrium, which
makes it eﬀective in the scenario of [16]. But in our present scenario, we need
a new estimation method with less time lag and faster reaction. For simplicity,
sometimes W also represents the time window which covers the W most recent
time points before t. Let

v0 (t) = M(cid:0)(cid:8)t − W < τ ≤ t : χv(τ ) = 0(cid:9)(cid:1)
T W
v1 (t) = M(cid:0)(cid:8)t − W < τ ≤ t : χv(τ ) = 1(cid:9)(cid:1)
T W






(9)

Notice that the smaller W implies the less time lag and the lower accuracy
the probability estimation exhibits. So we face the immediacy-accuracy trade-oﬀ
dilemma when selecting the proper time window W. It is also worth noting that
a simple way to enhance the estimation accuracy is to increase the sampling
frequency h (i.e., the constant time interval of the periodic observing method,
see also [16]). But there is always a limitation on the sampling frequency in
practice. In order to cope with this trade-oﬀ dilemma, we later propose the
design of adaptive time windows, which shows great performance.

In order to simulate a 0-1 ergodic process for ∀v ∈ V , the paper samples

node v at time t by its compromise probability iv(t):

χv(t) = H(cid:2)iv(t) − Rand(0, 1)(cid:3)

(10)

where Rand(0, 1) means drawing a random real number uniformly from [0, 1],
and H is the Discrete Heaviside step function:

H(x) =

(cid:40)

0 x < 0
1 x ≥ 0.

(11)

18

Z. Liu et al.

4.2 Using the Event-based Control Method in Practice

With the aid of the newly proposed estimation method with adaptive time
windows, which exhibits less time lag and faster response, the gap between
probability-states and sample-states has been properly bridged. We now use the
aforementioned event-based parameter switching method in practice to control
the preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics. Since undirected networks
are a special case of directed networks, only experiments on the directed Gnutella
peer-to-peer Network are performed here. Let the time window W = 30.

As proposed above, we use an adaptive time window

(cid:48)

W

(t) = max(W,

t
C0

)

(cid:48)

to replace the original time window W with a ﬁxed time length, where C0 is a
positive constant number.

In the settings of our numerical examples, let C0 = 3 for W

(t). Figure
3 shows the convergence process of the dynamics under control, using a time
window with adaptive time length to estimate the probability mv(t). We can
ﬁnd that there are still some events triggered in the advanced stage t ∈ [300, 500]
when probability iv(t) has fully converged to equilibrium zero, which means the
event-based parameter switching method becomes eﬀective by using the adaptive
time window. With respect to the convergence speed indexes, notice that the
threshold for it deﬁned in Section 3.4 is 10%. Figure 4(b) shows the eﬀectiveness
of the time window with adaptive time length, with |S−ι|
ι = 6.79% < 10%, while
|S−ι|
ι = 27.27% > 10% for the time window with ﬁxed time length exhibited
in Figure 4(a). Besides, with respect to the control cost, which is indicated by
the mean of time ratio 1
, recall the statement in Section 3.4, the
n
threshold of eﬃciency is deﬁned as 40% of the cost. The control cost in the
current numerical example is 0.60, which means the reactive defense setting is
under low-cost setting for 40% of the time.(the low-cost reactive defense setting
takes up 40% of the time)

5 Conclusion

In this paper, an event-based parameter switching method is proposed for the
control tasks of cybersecurity, which helps avoid excessive control costs as well as
guarantees the dynamics to converge as our desired speed. The Zeno-free prop-
erty is proved, implying the feasibility of the method. Meanwhile, we designed
a new estimation method with adaptive time windows in order to bridge the
gap between the probability state and the sampling state with less time lags.
Both theoretical and practical experiments are given to illustrate the param-
eter switching method, which show the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of our new
method.

There are many open problems for future research: Do there exist some better
event-based parameter switching trigger rule so as to save more defense resources

be applied to other dynamics control? Furthermore, similar parameter switching
approaches regarding the parameter γ for push-based attacks are worth further
studying.
