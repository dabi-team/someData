Abstract 

Because  of  today’s  technological  developments  and  the  influence  of  digital  systems  into  every  aspect  of  our  lives,  importance  of 
cyber  security improves  more  and  more  day-by-day.  Projects,  educational processes  and  seminars  realized  for  this  aim  create  and 
improve awareness among individuals and provide useful tools for growing equipped generations. The aim of this study is to focus 
on a cyber security eco-system, which was self-occurred within the interactive educational environment designed under the scope of 
TÜBİTAK  4004  Nature  Education  and Science  Schools  Projects  (with  the  name  of  A  Cyber  Security  Adventure)  with  the  use  of 
important  technologies  such  as  virtual  reality,  augmented  reality,  and  artificial  intelligence.  The  eco-system  occurred  within  the 
interactive  educational  process  where  high  school  students  took  place  caused  both  students  and  the  project  team  to  experience  an 
indirect social experiment environment. In this sense, it is thought that the findings and comments presented in the study will give 
important ideas to everyone involved  in cyber security education, life-long learning processes, and the technology use in software 
oriented educational tools. 

Keywords: cyber security, educational project, virtual and augmented reality, mobile technologies, artificial intelligence 

1. Introduction 

After rising of the computer technology, value of the information has increased rapidly because of almost infinite opportunities of 
processing information through digital systems and obtaining effective solutions for real world problems. Moreover, development of 
innovative  communication  technologies  such  as  Internet has  made  it  easier  to  carry  information  point  to point  and  ensure  instant, 
practical  information  processing  environment  spread  all  around  the  world.  As  a  result  of  that  revolutionary  location  change  of 
information (from minds, papers to the digital systems) and intense use of  digital systems for every daily life operations, the world 
has started to use the term: ‘data’ widely instead of the concept of information (Loukides, 2011; Mehlhorn, 2013). Although creating, 
processing, or transferring data have changed the humankind’s life totally and event resulted  to transformation of the society to an 
‘informatics  society’,  storing  the  information  in  the  form  of  data  has  caused  appearance  of  security  issues.  Because  of  alternative 
ways  to  ‘hack’  digital  systems  and  possibility  of  losing  the  data  because  of  environmental  factors,  keeping  the  data  secure  has 
become more and more important day-by-day (Hu, 2016; Pfleeger, & Pfleeger, 2002; Stallings et al., 2012). Today, there are many 
different approaches, methods, and techniques to hack the data / digital systems or build somehow security against dangerous and / or 
malevolent  scenarios.  Covered  by  the  topic  of  ‘cyber  security’,  design  and  development  of  different  solutions  always  has  a  top 
importance  because  of  unstoppable  new  technological  developments  changing  the  way  of  threatening  or  ensuring  cyber  security 
(Baig  et  al.,  2017;  Choo,  2011;  Dawson,  &  Thomson,  2018).  However,  since  many  malicious  attacks  include  also  person  /  user 
tricking phases (social engineering) and complete their process successfully when they are applied for untrained people / users, cyber 
security education has become a necessity for today’s individuals.  

Because of need for trained and ‘aware’ people / users against cyber security issues, there is a remarkable effort to conduct courses, 
educational  seminars  or  different-sized  projects  in  all  over  the  world.  In  the  USA,  there  is  already  a  long-time-performed  serious 
works  on  how  to  process  successful  cyber  security  education,  design  effective  curriculums,  and  rise  effective  workforce  in  this 
manner (Conklin et al., 2014; Ivy et al., 2019; McGettrick et al., 2014; Newhouse et al., 2017; Shoemaker et al., 2018). As the heart 
of  the  technology,  Japan has  already been discussing  effective  ways  for  successful  cyber  security education  (Beuran  et  al., 2016). 
There are already some reported studies from India, and Malaysia (of Far East), in the context of ensuring better cyber education and 
discussing current state of awareness regarding especially cyber security and laws (Mehta, &  Singh, 2013; Muniandy  et al., 2017; 
Saxena  et  al.,  2016).  In  Europe,  dominant  locations  such  as  UK  and  Germany  have  reported  studies  regarding  cyber  security 
education, awareness, and organization of workforces (Bada, & Nurse, 2019; Brittan et al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2011). As including 
more of Europe, and other regions such as Africa or South America, there have already been active studies regarding cyber education 
and  cyber  security  awareness,  considering  even  cyber  wars  (Catota  et  al.,  2019;  Knox  et  al., 2018;  Lejaka  et  al., 2019; Parker,  & 
Brown,  2018;  Tokola  et  al.,  2019;  Von  Solms,  &  Von  Solms,  2014).  As  it  has  already  been  reported  that  technology  supported 
competitions have important potential for alternative outcomes in cyber security education (Buchler et al., 2018; Cheung et al., 2012; 
Pusey  et  al.,  2016),  research  efforts  have  been  directed  to  design  of  alternative  activities  where  educators  and  learners  may  take 
active part by experiencing game-based, real component-based (i.e. robotics), virtual-lab supported, or team oriented (i.e. Capture the 
Flag) processes (Cheung et al., 2011; Chothia, & Novakovic, 2015; Giannakas et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2018; Khoo, 2019; Olano et al., 
2014;  Rand  et  al., 2018;  Werther  et  al.,  2011;  Willems  et  al., 2011).  At  this point,  importance of  managing  educational processes 
(whether they are traditional or innovative) has been often emphasized and even learning-teaching styles, emotional levels, or effects 
of digital / mass media have been evaluated for seeking better educational outcomes (Buckingham, 2015; Debeş, & Öznacar, 2018; 
Graziose  et  al.,  2016;  Johnson,  2015;  Khalid  et  al.,  2017;  Öznacar,  &  Dagli,  2016;  Öznacar,  &  Dericioğlu,  2017;  Öznacar  et  al., 
2017;  Öznacar  et  al.,  2018;  Parrish,  2015;  Van  der  Sandt,  &  O'Brien,  2017).  It  seems  that  every  educational process  may  require 
different managerial requirements and cause unexpected situations that can contribute to the outcomes differently. As one of the best

ways  to  run  today’s  cyber  education processes  seems  to  be  conducting  them  within projects,  a  unique  project  called  as  ‘A  Cyber 
Security Adventure’ was performed in Isparta, Turkey, during second half of 2018 and first months of 2019 (Kose, 2018). Except 
from  the  other  tasks  such  as  project  process  organization,  development  of  software,  and  past-activity  findings  analysis,  main 
educational activities of the project were done between 27 August 2018 and 9 September 2018, by including two stages: face-to-face 
education, and nature camp, respectively. In addition to the findings reported in detail by Kose (2018), the project has also included 
many different findings, generally occurred from unexpected states caused by dynamic nature of educational flow.  

Based on the explanations so far, the aim of this study is to focus on a cyber security eco-system, which was self-occurred within an 
interactive educational environment designed under the scope of TÜBİTAK 4004 Nature Education and Science Schools Projects. 
With the use  of important  technologies  such  as  virtual  reality,  augmented  reality,  and  artificial  intelligence,  the  related  interactive 
educational environment was realized under a unique project titled as ‘A Cyber Security Adventure’ (with also an acronym: BSGM, 
as  derived  from  the  Turkish  title:  ‘Bir  Siber  Güvenlik  Macerası’).  Except  from  the  findings-results  obtained  with  the  planned 
evaluation methods (as reported in also Kose, 2018), active project environment has caused to creation of an unexpected eco-system. 
The eco-system occurred within the interactive educational process where high school students took place caused both students and 
the  project  team  to  experience  an  indirect  social  experiment  environment.  Although  findings  from  planned  evaluation  methods  of 
different  interactive  activities  or  project  organizations  may  have  great  importance  in  terms  of  literature,  some  hidden  details  and 
unexpected experiences-outcomes can give more information about benefits of the formed educational environments and open minds 
for further, alternative research studies.  In this sense, it is thought that the findings and comments presented in the study will give 
important ideas to everyone involved  in cyber security education, life-long learning processes, and the technology use in software 
oriented educational tools. 

Considering the topic and the aim of the study, the remaining content is organized as follows: The next section briefly gives essential 
information about the realized project. In this way, the readers are enabled to have enough information about why that project was 
designed  and  how  it  was  organized  accordingly.  After  that  section,  the  third  section  explains  some  remarkable  findings  obtained 
thanks to the project. Although these findings may be subject to other studies (as the project has many different perspectives to write 
down  different  reports,  papers…etc.),  it  is  also  important  to  inform  the  target  readers  about  the  findings  briefly.  Next,  the  fourth 
section  focuses  on  the  unexpected  eco-system  and  some  observations  associated  with  that  eco-system.  That  fourth  section  has 
become  the  main  section  explaining  the  exact  research  achievements  pointed in this  study.  After  the  fourth  section,  the  content  is 
ended with the final, fifth section including discussions regarding conclusions and some thought future works. 

2. A Project in the Nature: A Cyber Security Adventure 

In Turkey, TÜBİTAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) opens project calls in the context of different 
scopes. As one of these calls, the call numbered with 4004 is associated with educational projects aiming to combine both scientific 
perspectives  and  interactive  activities  done  at  the  nature.  In  this  sense,  the  project:  ‘A  Cyber  Security  Adventure’  (with  also  an 
acronym: BSGM, as derived from the Turkish title: ‘Bir Siber Güvenlik Macerası’) was accepted to be funded by TÜBİTAK during 6 
months  period  between  27  July  2018  and  27  January  2019  (Figure  1  shows  both  TÜBİTAK  call  logo  and  the  project  logo).  As 
supported  with  a  total  of  80.097  Turkish  Liras  (around  14.580  USD  in  August  2019)  funding,  the  project  aimed  to  improve  high 
school students’ awareness, knowledge, abilities towards cyber security, thanks to different educational activities (Kose, 2018). 

Figure 16: a) TÜBİTAK 4004 call logo – b) A Cyber Security Adventure (BSGM) project logo (Kose, 2018). 

As  the  project  lead  by  Assistant  Prof.  Dr.  Utku  Kose  (from  Dept.  of  Computer  Engineering  at  Suleyman  Demirel  University, 
Turkey), call for students and selection of them were done collaboratively with also Isparta Directorate for the Ministry of Education. 
Because the city of Isparta in Turkey was chosen as the project location, a total of 40 high school students from 10 high schools (with 
4-student group of each school) enrolled in the project activities. As it was indicated in the first section, main educational activities of 
the project were done during 14-day period between 27 August 2018 and 9 September 2018. Between 27 August 2018 and 31 August 
2018,  40  students  experienced  face-to-face  education  period  done  by  academicians  from  the  Dept.  of  Computer  Engineering  at 
Suleyman  Demirel  University.  Except  from  training  regarding  the  educational  software-applications  that  will  be  used  later,  the 
following subjects were considered during the face-to-face education period (Kose, 2018): 

•  Essentials of computer and communication technologies, 
•  Essential components of today’s cyber world, 
•  The concepts of system, and algorithm, 
• 
• 

Importance of cyber security and awareness regarding it, 
Importance of being ethical (white-hat) hacker,

•  Theoretical and practical background for cyber-attack, 
•  Theoretical and practical background for cyber-defense, 
• 
• 

Importance of social engineering and ways to be defended from it, 
Importance of cyber bullying ways to be defended from it. 

Following  to  the  face-to-face  education  period,  a  9-day  nature  camp  was  held  in  Egirdir  county  of  Isparta.  40  students  from  10 
different schools were grouped into 10 teams (as each school forming a team) for the nature camp. The nature camp was done in the 
natural  environment  of  the  Green  Island  District  (called  as  Island  in  Egirdir)  as  the  whole  process  activities  were  tracked  by  the 
project  staff.  Each  team  was  also  directed  by  one  guide  attended  to  it  (Kose,  2018).  Figure  2  represents  a  photo  of  Green  Island 
District of Egirdir and some photos from activity times. 

Figure 17: Green Island District of Egirdir and some photos from project activity times, respectively. 

The  interactivity  ensured  for  better  educational  outcomes  during  the  nature  camp  were  done  with  the  support  by  technology  and 
educational software use. The following sub-section provides brief information regarding that. 

2.1. Technology and Educational Software Use in the Project 

A Cyber Security Adventure consisted of using some technological approaches and educational software systems for ensuring a high 
interactivity. In this context, a virtual scenario asking the students-teams to find the cyber pirate among 5 suspected virtual characters 
were run on the background. In detail, all the nature camp was a combination of dynamically changing sub-stories supporting the 
main scenario so that the cyber pirate can be determined step-by-step, according to each successfully solved sub-story (Kose, 2018). 
The following technology and educational software use approaches supported the whole scenario flow and a high level interactivity 
was achieved in this way (Kose, 2018): 

•  Mobile Device Use: Nature camp included intense use of mobile devices in order to interact with the real world and ensure a 
bridge between the real world and the virtual scenario. In this context, each team had one tablet device and everybody allowed 
using their own mobile devices (i.e. smart phones or other mobile devices). 

•  Augmented  Reality:  As  a  combination of  both  real  and  virtual world  (Furht, 2011;  Kose, 2015),  Augmented  Reality  is often 
used for software systems aiming to run high level interactivity. In the nature camp, it was aimed to run Augmented Reality for 
collecting  virtual  materials  spread  in  the  real  world  and  interact  with  QR  codes  or  specially  designed  signs  (located  over  i.e. 
buildings, trees, or other real components) for activating sub-scenarios or solving puzzles.

III. International Scientific and Vocational Studies Congress - Engineering 

•  Artificial Intelligence: As one the most effective technology of today’s world (Rabelo et al., 2018; Russell, & Norvig, 2016), 
and  widely  used  for  developing  intelligent  educational  software  systems,  Artificial  Intelligence  was  used  for  designing  an 
adaptive infrastructure, which is directing each team through the virtual scenario. As inspiring from Role Playing Games (RPG), 
each  team  consisted  of  5  attributes:  Speed,  Team  Spirit,  Ability,  Energy,  and  Resource.  According  to  different  solutions  by 
students of the teams (or in case of unsolved problems) for sub-scenarios / activities, these attributes were adaptively scored by 
the  intelligent  system  running  on  the  background.  Also,  thanks  to  an  intelligent  combinatorial  optimization  approach  (Du,  & 
Pardalos,  2013;  Siarry  et  al.,  2016),  the  best  sub-scenario  flow  for  each  team  was  determined  by  the  intelligent  system,  from 
many different possible sub-scenarios designed before.  

•  Software Systems / Applications: During nature camp, the teams were wanted to use some developed software systems / mobile 
applications,  in  order  to  solve  puzzles,  enroll  in  competitions,  gain  points  individually,  and  eventually  go  through  the  sub-
scenarios.  In  order  to  benefit  from  their  knowledge  and  abilities  gained  during  face-to-face  education  period,  students  used 
software systems / applications called as ‘Attacking Machine’, ‘Defensing Machine’, ‘Tracker’, ‘Reader’, and ‘Code Breaking 
Machine’. 

•  Social  Media:  As  an  essential  technological  component  for  the  nature  camp,  social  media  was  used  for  supporting  the 
interactivity  and  communication  among  all  people  including  students,  and  even  project  staff.  Thanks  to  groups  created  over 
WhatsApp,  instant  problems  to be  solved  in  some  allowed  time  period  were  announced  and other social  media  channels  were 
used for better interaction and information share. 

2.2. General Educational Activities in the Project 

Considering  the  technological  components  expressed  briefly  under  the  previous  sub-section,  general  educational  activities  in  the 
project were organized in the context of the following activity scopes (Kose, 2018): 

•  Theoretical and applied lectures (during 5-day face-to-face education period),  
•  Group studies (during 9-day nature camp period), 
•  Project based studies (during 9-day nature camp period),  
•  Drama studies (during 9-day nature camp period),  
•  Analytical and logical problem-solving (during 9-day nature camp period), 
•  Sportive competitions (during 9-day nature camp period), 
• 
•  Problems requiring social interaction (during 9-day nature camp period), 
•  Software / application use (during 9-day nature camp period). 

Individual problem solving (during 9-day nature camp period),  

3. Findings from the Project 

Statistically,  a  composite  approach  was  applied  for  obtaining  findings  regarding  students,  and  their  activities  during  the  project 
period. For getting information about students’ perception and attitudes against cyber security, a pre-test and post-test approach was 
applied over a survey. Also, interviews and observations were done for getting more information about students. Additionally, some 
more  technical  tests  for  understanding  more  about  effectiveness  of  the  technological  components  and  their  usability  levels  were 
applied.  Furthermore,  some  findings  from  project  staff  (especially  from  guides)  were  obtained  for  additional  analyses.  All  these 
findings have been already reported by Kose (2018). But considering the whole findings from the composite approach for students 
and some technical analyses, the following points can be expressed briefly (Kose, 2018): 

•  Students’ perception and attitude levels changed positively after the project (That affected also some people from project staff).  
•  Students enjoyed the whole process and wanted to experience similar processes again (That is same for also project staff).  
•  Students were highly motivated for the issues of cyber security, after the project period. 
•  Students, who has some past knowledge and ability regarding cyber security and computer use, contributed to their team greatly. 
•  Teams, who created more team synergy, has achieved better during nature camp. 
•  Teams were generally aware of using their team attributes against solving sub-scenarios / problems / puzzles. 
•  The project contributed to cyber security awareness and gaining knowledge-ability against current state of the digital world. 
• 
• 

Interactivity and the natural environment contributed positive outcomes greatly. 
It  was  shown  that  a  combination  of  nature  (real  world)  and  technology  (digital-cyber  world)  can  contribute  to  educational 
processes better. 

•  The project took attention of national and international groups enrolled in cyber security, technological developments, and the 

digital world. 

•  Especially nature camp has caused an unexpected cyber security eco-system of (as the main topic of this study, explained under 

the fourth section). 

•  A remarkable number of students improved their self-confidence, leadership, and academic level, thanks to the project. 
•  The project contributed positively to some students’ future career ideas. These students generally motivated about choosing their 

career to move within cyber security, computer (software and/or hardware) technology, or communication technology. 

•  Software  systems  /  applications  were  generally  usable  and  efficient  enough  in  terms  of  enabling  students  and  project  staff  to 

focus on only task and perform their tasks within desired time periods. 

•  The  Artificial  Intelligence  infrastructure  was  successful  enough  to  run  an  adaptive  scenario  flow,  according  to  dynamically 

changing parameters of the nature camp and teams.

4. Occurrence of a Cyber Security Eco-system in the Project 

Especially nature camp period of the project included a wide interaction among students, project staff. Additionally, that interaction 
was  somehow  adaptively  controlled  /  directed  by  the  intelligent  infrastructure  and  the  running  software  systems  /  applications. 
Although the virtual scenario included lots of sub-scenarios and alternative ways to complete it (even some sub-scenarios were not 
activated by the teams), it was at least having a certain plan designed before. On the other hand, there were some instant touches by 
the  project  leader:  Dr.  Kose,  in  order  to  ensure  a  dynamic  scenario  flow.  However,  the  nature  camp  faced  also  an  unexpected 
formation  of  a  cyber  security  eco-system,  because  of  competition  and  ambition  increased  day-by-day.  That  situation  has  affected 
even  some  of  project  staff  and  eventually  the  nature  camp  turned  into  a  also  a  social  experiment.  The  related  eco-system  and  the 
associated indirect social experiment are all remarkable to be analyzed, as valuable, additional findings. 

The indirectly appeared cyber security eco-system had the following components with their potentials in that eco-system: 

•  Teams / Students: Because of high competition level, teams / students were important to eliminate each other, by considering 

every type of fake activities or counter-activities.  

•  Guides: Guides were responsible for controlling students and directing them to solutions if they find the problem / sub-scenario 
difficult to solve. But because they were informed about only general framework of the scenario, they knew nothing about how to 
follow true ways of the scenario and how much their team can gain from each sub-scenario / problem, which were even created 
by the project leader sometimes. So, guides had always potential to be hooked in competition and ambition. 

•  Nature / Environment:  Components for especially Augmented Reality, and software interactions (so that interaction with the 
nature / environment) were located over real components such as buildings, trees, signs, or even other things such as cars, daily 
life materials…etc. Because of that, they were potential tools within an eco-system, which can be used by everybody for tricking 
others and even Artificial Intelligence infrastructure. 

•  Artificial  Intelligence  /  Software  Systems  /  Applications:  All  software  oriented  components  including  also  Artificial 
Intelligence infrastructure had the potential of to be tricked because of their digital nature. That is exactly an important actor of a 
typical cyber security eco-system since it is associated with the digital world. 

•  People  Out  of  the  Project:  In  some  sub-scenarios,  students’  tasks  included  interaction  with  people  out  of  the  project.  These 
people were generally shop owners or somebody chosen from near environment. They had been informed before about the sub-
scenarios and about their responses-roles against students. But they had the potential to be tricked and even people having no idea 
about the project were potential individuals, so that students can mistakenly think that they know something about the scenario. 

In the context of the mentioned components, competitive environment has caused formation of an eco-system, where the following 
events occurred: 

•  Some teams having members, who know computer programming, tried to hack the software systems / applications.  
•  Students  started  to  create  fake  QR  codes  for  locating  them over  real  components,  so  that  they  can  trick  other  teams  and  even 

guides (Figure 3). 

•  Over social media, students started to send fake messages and announcements to trick other teams and directing them to distant 

locations of the environment so that they cannot complete new, sudden tasks in time. 

•  Students started to arrange fake people to trick other teams / students about solutions of sub-scenarios. 
•  Students started to talk with other teams’ guides, in order to trick them. 
•  Some  teams  even  developed  fake  software  or  virtual  materials  so  that  other  teams  can  use  them  (by  wasting  their  time)  and 

collecting unnecessary virtual materials. 

•  There were some soft arguing / discussions between students of different teams. 
• 

Instead of their team members (students), some guides started to give more efforts in order to be successful in physical activities 
and even argued with some other guides sometimes. 
In some activities requiring knowledge, it was reported that some guides helped their team. 

• 
•  Some  two-three  teams  become  allies  against  certain  teams  during  physical  activities  or  within  ‘Attacking  Machine’  or 

‘Defending Machine’ applications. 

•  As general, social engineering oriented attacks become popular among teams. 
•  Teams started to give more consideration to defending themselves, in addition to their attacking activities. 
•  As similar in real world, some teams acted like cyber pirates to eliminate other teams and some other teams also acted as ethical 
hackers to save the environment from such teams. Thankfully, teams acting like cyber pirates turned back to the ethical side later. 

As it can be understood, an indirect social experiment rose during the nature camp and caused teams and project staff to experience a 
real world like cyber security eco-system, where members can change side, become allies, run different methods for tricking purpose, 
and try to defend themselves against possible attacks.

After seeing existence of the related eco-system and social experiment flow, the project leader: Dr. Kose decided to gather the related 
observation  notes  as  the  findings  just  expressed  under  the  previous  paragraphs.  Additionally,  he  also  analyzed  some  numerical 
findings regarding tricking activities done by each team. Table 1 provides total number of tricking activities by each team for each 
nature camp day, by total number of different tricking activities done as using fake QR-materials, sending fake messages, applying 
social engineering, direct attack to team(s), direct defense against team(s), attacking with ally / allies, and defense with  ally / allies. 
Names of the teams during the nature camp were used in the Table 1 accordingly. On the other hand, tricking intensity levels has 
shown in table cells, by using four colors; white: zero, blue: light, yellow: medium, and red: high.

aTricking intensity is shown with four colors; white: zero, blue: light, yellow: medium, and red: high. 

As it can be seen from Table 1, more competition and ambition increasing day-by-day caused most of teams to use tricking ways. 
Although  some  teams  were  more  robust  against  tricking,  tricking  levels  for  all  teams  show  existence  of  an  eco-system.  The  eco-
system shows high intensity during especially middle of the nature camp and starts to disappear towards the end of the camp.  It is 
remarkable that both students and project staff enjoyed that indirect social experiment and expressed their positive ideas about that 
suddenly  appeared  situation,  after  the  end of  the  nature  camp.  It  is  certain  that  this occurrence  of  the  eco-system  and  the  indirect 
social experiment has contributed to the project for more positive educational outcomes. 

5. Conclusions and Future Work 

In  this  study,  an  unexpected  occurrence  of  a  cyber  security  eco-system  in  the  context  of  the  TÜBİTAK  4004  project:  ‘A  Cyber 
Security  Adventure’  was  discussed  generally.  That  eco-system  has  caused  also  rise  of  an  indirect  social  experiment,  which  has 
contributed to the project outcomes in a positive manner. As including a total of 40 students directed by 10 guides, and also other 
project  staff,  almost  everybody  enrolled  in  the  nature  camp  period  has  taken  active  role  in  creating  a  cyber  security  eco-system,

where tricking, cyber attacking, and cyber defensing in terms of allies or direct purposes were often observed along 9-day camp. The 
findings in this manner are valuable for educational outcomes and point that such educational activities can be more effective if some 
unexpected  situations  and  social  experiments  can  be  included,  too.  Out  of  the  planned  activities,  it  could  be  better  to  leave  some 
uncontrolled parameters so that such educational processes can be more effective over individuals. As the nature camp of the project 
was  conducted  in  the  natural  environment  of  Egirdir,  Isparta  (Turkey),  interaction  with  the  real  world  in  addition  to  other 
technologically  caused  interactions  have  enabled  the  project  staff  to  get  more  than  desired  for  having  successful  results  with  the 
project. 

Obtained  positive  findings  have  encouraged  the  author  (project  leader)  to  think  about  future  works  more.  As  indicated  before  by 
Kose (2018), a second version of the project has already planned with the title ‘Another Cyber Security Adventure’ (with also an 
acronym: B2SGM, as derived from the Turkish title: ‘Bir Başka Siber Güvenlik Macerası’). That second version will include a wider 
scenario with more technology use and just waits for  funding to be realized. Additionally, more analyses regarding the unexpected 
cyber security eco-system were planned as additional future works. Finally, there will be alternative projects for different topics (i.e. 
robotics,  future  of  Artificial  Intelligence)  and  these  projects  will  certainly  include  some  spaces  to  open  doors  for  unexpected 
experiments, which seem very critical and remarkable to be analyzed for better educational outcomes.
