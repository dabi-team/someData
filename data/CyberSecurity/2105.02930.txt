Abstract—As cybercrime becomes one of the most signiﬁcant
threats facing society today, it is of utmost importance to better
understand the perpetrators behind such attacks. In this article,
we seek to advance research and practitioner understanding of
the cybercriminal (cyber-offender) proﬁling domain by conduct-
ing a rigorous systematic review. This work investigates the afore-
mentioned domain to answer the question: what is the state-of-
the-art in the academic ﬁeld of understanding, characterising and
proﬁling cybercriminals. Through the application of the PRISMA
systematic literature review technique, we identify 39 works from
the last 14 years (2006-2020). Our ﬁndings demonstrate that
overall, there is lack of a common deﬁnition of proﬁling for
cyber-offenders. The review found that one of the primary types
of cybercriminals that studies have focused on is hackers and the
majority of papers used the deductive approach as a preferred
one. This article produces an up-to-date characterisation of the
ﬁeld and also deﬁnes open issues deserving of further attention
such as the role of security professionals and law enforcement in
supporting such research, as well as factors including personality
traits which must be further researched whilst exploring online
criminal behaviour. By understanding online offenders and their
pathways towards malevolent behaviours, we can better identify
steps that need to be taken to prevent such criminal activities.

I. INTRODUCTION

Cybercrime and the persistent wave of cyber-attacks being
witnessed in society today pose signiﬁcant challenges to
security in the 21st century. To properly examine the topic of
cybercrime, it is important to ﬁrst deﬁne it. For our purposes,
we use the deﬁnition provided by the European Commission
(EC) given its broad nature and thus, ability to allow us
to adopt a more inclusive approach to our work. As such,
cybercrimes hereafter are regarded as “criminal acts committed
using electronic communications networks and information
systems or against such networks and systems” [17]. This
deﬁnition encompasses a large range of crimes (e.g., hacking,
social engineering, fraud, denial of service attacks and online
harassment) and has been used as the foundation for several
other academic research works [1], [6], [42].

Across government, industry and academia, there have been
numerous efforts to address the issue of cybercrime. Govern-
ments have largely responded with regulation and bolstered
law enforcement capabilities (e.g., The Joint Cybercrime Ac-
tion Taskforce (J-CAT) of Europol), industry has prioritised
security policies, procedures and controls, and academia has
pursued a combination of approaches (across domains such

as criminology, computing and psychology). To complement
these proposals, cybersecurity technologists have offered an
array of platforms and tools.

While the efforts above are crucial parts required to address
the problem, another component that has received considerably
less dedicated attention is that of developing a comprehensive
understanding of cybercriminals (hereafter also referred to
as cyber-offenders) themselves, i.e., the notion of ‘proﬁling
cybercriminals’. Criminal or offender proﬁling, in general, is
a tool that has been used by forensic experts for decades and
can help to identify the offender’s behavioural tendencies,
personality traits, demographic variables, and geographical
variables based on the information and characteristics of the
crime [37]. Applying such techniques to cyber-offenders could
offer similar beneﬁts to the online space, and act as another
tool for law enforcement to draw upon.

This article furthers research and practitioners’ understand-
ing of the cybercriminal-proﬁling domain by conducting a
comprehensive systematic review. Systematic reviews expand
on the concept of traditional literature reviews by mandating
a series of systematic, structured and explicit methods to
gather and analyse relevant research [41]. In particular, this
work synthesises and critically reﬂects on the aforementioned
domain to answer the question: what is the state-of-the-art in
the academic ﬁeld of understanding, characterising or proﬁling
cybercriminals? Through this analysis we expect to extract
crucial insight into this domain, its nature and development
over several years.

Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the most common venues (e.g.,
journals, conferences, archives) where articles in this ﬁeld are
disseminated, the domains in which their authors originate
(e.g., through academic afﬁliation, or professionals in law
enforcement or industry) and the general types of studies
conducted (e.g., reviews, proﬁles, methodologies). This work
further investigates the nature of the articles and the contribu-
tions they seek to make to the body of knowledge of under-
standing cybercriminals, their actions and behaviour. These
contributions, as an example, may pertain to the deﬁnitions
of proﬁling/understanding, variety of datasets used/analysed,
proposed proﬁles themselves (deduced from research or prac-
tice), and approaches (or methodologies) to better understand
cybercriminals and characterise them (e.g., motivations, etc.).
In addition to forming a comprehensive understanding of
the articles, we are also interested in whether there is any

demonstrated or intended engagement with law enforcement
agencies (LEAs); these are the ideal users of such research.
Through the investigation of the various aspects mentioned
above, we are able to provide in-depth insights into current
research and also identify gaps in knowledge in the topic
space, and therefore highlight where further research within
this domain is required.

II. METHOD

A. Protocol and registration

The core value of the systematic review process is in the
structure that it provides to the search, gathering and analysis
of pertinent literature. To guide our study’s application of
this process further, we have chosen the PRISMA (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses)
technique and protocol [41]. PRISMA outlines a minimum set
of items/tasks required for conducting and reporting systematic
reviews. It is evidenced-based, well-regarded and straightfor-
ward to apply. Our adoption of this technique involved deﬁning
each of the items necessary and creating an appropriate plan
of analysis. For instance, this entailed identifying eligibility
criteria for the literature search, relevant information sources,
and the data collection process. The main sections (and sub-
sections) that follow each map to items outlined by PRISMA.

B. Eligibility criteria

To guide the selection of articles of the review, there were
two inclusion criteria. The ﬁrst (IC1) required articles to be
published/reported in English, and the second (IC2) sought to
elicit articles that pertain to the understanding, characterising
or proﬁling of cybercriminals or cyber-offenders. While IC1
was imposed due to the language spoken by this article’s
authors, we believe this is a reasonable criteria given English
is widely regarded as the primary language of the community.
The rationale for IC2 can be found in this study’s research
question and the direction it has outlined for our review. It
should be noted that this study does not consider articles that
deal with the understanding or proﬁling of traditional criminals
conducting crimes ofﬂine. Crimes, and therefore articles, that
would be of interest are those which ﬁt the description of
cybercrime presented in Section I.

C. Information sources

The research topic under investigation stretches across nu-
merous domains and therefore a wide range of information
sources were searched for appropriate articles, including jour-
nals, conference proceedings, and book chapters. Publication
databases explored include well-known and reputable sources,
namely, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, ACM Digital
Library, IEEE Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Springer. In
addition to the articles discovered in the various (academic and
otherwise) searches above, the reference lists of the articles
themselves were (iteratively) analysed to identify relevant, new
contributions. All searches were conducted in June 2020.

D. Search and article selection

The search and article selection process followed steps
informed by the factors deﬁned earlier. The ﬁrst step was
searching for articles in the databases listed that were relevant
to the aims of this research. Search queries were constructed
using key words commonly associated with the general re-
search topic. To capture the criminal aspect, we used: “cy-
bercriminal” and “cyber-offender” (in addition to appropriate
variations such as “cyber-criminal” and “cyber offenders”). To
accommodate for the proﬁling component, we used a wide
range of keywords including: proﬁling, behaviour, methodol-
ogy, psychological and personality. Tests with keywords were
conducted and reﬁned to ensure that they captured a wide set
of articles—if articles were later found to be irrelevant, this
was preferred to potentially excluding relevant articles.

The ﬁnal keyword search query was as follows: ((“cyber
criminal” OR “cyber criminals” OR cybercriminal OR cyber-
criminals OR “cyber offender” OR “cyber offenders”) AND
(understanding OR proﬁling OR proﬁle OR behaviour OR
behavior OR characterising OR methodology OR psychology
OR psychological OR personality)).

The discovered articles were then examined according to the
eligibility criteria, with special attention ﬁrst placed on their ti-
tles, abstracts and key word lists, and then as necessary (e.g., if
the article appears to fulﬁl the ﬁrst two criteria) on the full text.
As articles were reviewed, attention was also placed on their
reference lists and bibliographies, in the event that additional
relevant work was present (and therefore should be included).
To maintain a rigorous approach to the research, the broad
search and selection process was undertaken independently by
this paper’s two authors; differences on the selection process of
additional relevant work were discussed and agreed upon. For
example, the authors excluded some papers which were out of
scope for this work, since they didn’t focus on proﬁling, but in
other topics in relation to cybercrime [40]. Before continuing,
we note that the decision to use the word ‘cyber’ as opposed to
‘online’ or ‘internet’ was intentional. This was done to focus
our study on research that considered their work on cyber-
criminal/offender proﬁling. Moreover, this decision was in line
with our more broad emphasis on cybercrime. We discuss the
implications of this approach later in the article.

E. Data collection process and Data items

From the selected articles, relevant data was collected using
a data extraction form. This form outlined key features of
interest which aligned with the systematic review’s aim. Each
article was assessed separately by the two authors and differ-
ences in the data extracted were discussed for an agreement
to be made.

To structure our data extraction task, we speciﬁed vari-
ables appropriate to this aim. These functioned at two levels:
descriptive—to capture high-level metadata about each article
and thus assist in supplying a overview of the ﬁeld of literature;
and in-depth—to focus on more detailed analyses and thereby
develop a detailed understanding of the manuscripts. These
variables are presented in Table I.

DATA ITEMS USED TO EXAMINE SELECTED STUDIES

Having speciﬁed the structure of our systematic review,
including articles of interest and key data to be extracted from
selected articles, next we present and discuss the results.

A. Selection of articles

III. RESULTS

In total, 39 articles were selected for our review. From
our database search, we initially found 3189 articles across
the seven sources. After deduplication, 1023 were removed
leaving 2166 remaining. Application of IC1 resulted in us
discarding 3 manuscripts, while application of IC2 (which
also included reviewing full text as necessary) removed 2127
articles. Reference lists of the remaining articles were exam-
ined and 3 articles meeting IC1 and IC2 were included. This
resulted in 39 studies for this review.

The process adopted is also depicted in Figure 1.

B. Characteristics of articles

The articles selected from our review provided key insights
into the cybercriminal proﬁling domain, including its nature,
and how research efforts have progressed over time. In this
section we focus on descriptive characteristics of these articles.
Across all years, there were 24 articles in journals, seven in
conferences and nine in book chapters. From our analysis we
found only six sources appear more than once: Crime, Law and
Social Change Journal (3), Digital Investigation Journal (2),
Trends in Organized Crime (2), Information Systems Frontiers
(2), and the European Conference on Cyber Warfare and
Security (2).

Reﬂecting on the location of authors that have contributed to
the ﬁeld of proﬁling, 16 countries are represented (and we state
the number of articles in brackets): USA (12), UK (10), The
Netherlands (6), Australia (4), South Africa (2), Switzerland
(2), Estonia (1), Brazil (1), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1), Spain
(1), Canada (1), Ghana (1), China (1), Philippines (1), Nigeria
(1), and South Korea (1).

On the topic of cybercriminal proﬁling speciﬁcally, a num-
ber of studies contributed either in methodologies for pro-
ﬁling [9], [29], [46], [55], in the application of proﬁling in
areas [5], [8], [18], [25], or in open issues in proﬁling [4].

The topic of cybercriminal groups featured in numerous
studies, as authors sought to understand and characterise the
behaviour of these groups. Contributions engaged in general
analysis of groups including those involved in organised crime
[7], [12], [13], [32], [33], [35] while further investigating
questions such as how they build trust [59] and what typologies
of cybercriminal networks may exist [34].

The type of data used to investigate cybercriminals is also
crucial to understanding the nature of this research on this
topic. We found that 22 (or, just over half of the) articles rely
on new data, be it from surveys, interviews (with criminals
and law enforcement), court records, case studies, underground
markets or honeypots [3], [7], [8], [10], [11], [24], [29],
[31]–[36], [43]–[45], [48], [49], [52], [57]–[59]. The other
studies primarily use existing literature to form their arguments
and often rely on research from other ﬁelds, or established
approaches mapped to the cybercrime domain [2], [4], [5],
[9], [12], [13], [15], [18], [21], [25], [27], [46], [50], [53]–[56].
This balance is interesting to note as it highlights the extent
of articles on proﬁling that are not working with primary data.

C. Deﬁnitions of cybercriminal proﬁling

Most of the papers we reviewed included a deﬁnition on
criminal proﬁling or offender proﬁling rather than cybercrim-
inal proﬁling. For example:

Criminal proﬁling is an investigative approach based
on the assumption that the crime scene provides
details about the offense and the offender [8].

One paper provided a speciﬁc deﬁnition of cybercriminal
proﬁling [10]. That paper also focused more on the motivations
behind engaging in cybercrime. As described: “....Determining
and understanding why hackers do what they do”. Overall,

the deﬁnitions provided focused on different criminal proﬁling
approaches such as inductive and deductive proﬁling
[3],
[4], [9], [11], [46], [48], [55], geographic proﬁling [8], and
psychological proﬁling [46].

D. Types of cybercriminal(s) researched

One of the aspects of interest in this work is the type of

cybercriminals studied in cybercriminal proﬁling research.

The papers focusing on hackers study white hat, black
hat hackers and hacktivists [3], [4], [7], [12], [13], [18],
[21], [27], [49], [54]–[56]. The basis on which different
members of the hacker community differentiate themselves
is the ethics of their activities, such as black hat or white hat
hackers which acknowledges the use of malicious or ethical
applications of hacking [20]. Hacktivists can be motivated by
political views, cultural/religious beliefs or terrorist ideology
[19]. Also, the focus seems to be on hackers using carding
forums. An example of a carding forum is Tor which enhances
the anonymity of user activity on the dark web and enables
criminals to quickly distribute compromised information and
to proﬁt from using it in a fraudulent way [30]. As it pertains to
fraudsters, studies focused on counterfeits and reproductions,
in fraud and/or unauthorised access as well as cybercrimes
affecting the banking sector.

Overall,

the topic. In doing so,

to focus on
the majority of studies seem not
speciﬁc types of cybercriminals, rather employ a general
lens while looking at
these stud-
ies focus on factors such as educational-attainment, modus-
operandi, and networks-collaborators [31]. As stated in one
paper: Cybercriminals are a diverse group, yet you can spot
some patterns and motives across the group [52]. Finally,
some papers attempted to construct typologies for organised
cybercriminal networks [12], [24], [34]. For example, different
roles were identiﬁed within cybercriminal phishing networks:
core members, professional enablers, recruited enablers, and
money mules [34].

E. Approaches to proﬁling or understanding cybercriminals

We now move to describe the different approaches adopted
to proﬁle or understand cybercriminals, based on the studies in
our review. By ‘approach’ we refer to the different frameworks
or models utilised to studying proﬁles and the methodologies
followed in the analysis.

Through this assessment, our work identiﬁed several dif-
ferent methods and approaches used to construct proﬁles or
understand online offenders. Some papers were descriptive in
their approach, while others were based on case study analysis
[7], [12], [13], [21], [54]. Others conducted interviews in
order to construct proﬁles and collect information about the
personality and practices of online offenders [31], [33], [35]. In
terms of the method used to analyse information, approaches
such as inductive and deductive proﬁling were found [4], [5],
[9], [48], [55]. As described:

Inductive proﬁling involves the study of a group
of subjects who share a common characteristic or

activity to discern trends or patterns in their mo-
tives, characteristics or behavior. Deductive proﬁling
refers to the assessment of a subject’s personal
characteristics from his or her crimes, activities,
statements or other reports and is associated with
case investigations [48].

For some papers, the deductive approach was preferred [5],
[9], [48]. The deductive approach explores information such as
demographics, personal characteristics, risk related behaviour,
impulsiveness, history and personality traits. It has been used,
for instance, in order to study the proﬁles of insider threats
[48]. It appears to be a preferred method for many since it
is more applicable to case-based studies, in which the crime,
attack or threat is analysed and speciﬁc characteristics of the
perpetrator are developed [7], [12], [13], [21], [54].

Some studies have stepped further and proposed a proﬁling
methodology incorporating both the inductive as well as the
deductive proﬁling approaches [5], [55]. For example, the
proposed methodology for cyber criminal proﬁling by [55]
employs six Proﬁle Identiﬁcation Metrics to determine the
offender’s modus operandi, psychology, and behavior charac-
teristics. These are: attack signature, attack method, motivation
level, capability factor, attack severity, demographics. Simi-
larly, a generic, deductive-oriented proﬁling framework with
a dominant behavioural evidence analysis inﬂuence is being
suggested in another study [5]. This framework is integrated
to a digital forensics process methodology, and in addition
to the technical and behavioural aspects, a legal aspect is
introduced to guide the process of proﬁling where issues of
transnationalism are encountered.

Another approach identiﬁed is the behavioural analysis used
to analyse online auction fraud offenders, based on personal
characteristics and motivation data [11], [46]. This approach
is often described as:

Psychological proﬁling and investigative psychology
have played and will continue to play a crucial role
in understanding why certain crimes are committed,
developing proﬁles of likely suspects, and linking
crimes to speciﬁc individuals or groups [46].

Geographic proﬁling is another approach used for cyber-

crime investigations [8].

The researchers developed GeoCrime, a geographic pro-
ﬁling software designed to assist
in the mapping, spatial
and statistical analysis of cybercrime patterns. Geographic
proﬁling is important, especially in situations where little
is known about the offender, such as in cybercrime, where
offenders use the Internet to hide their identities and activities.
Also, other work has used psycho-linguistic analysis [9] and
crime script analysis [56] methods. A crime script analysis
involves breaking down the actions of the criminal into four
main stages: preparation, pre-activity, activity, and post ac-
tivity. As this study claims, an appreciation of the offender’s
mind/perspective seems to be of the greatest importance in the
creation of crime scripts, to better understand the behaviours,
motives, feelings, decisions within the process of a crime [56].

The well-known criminal proﬁling framework of the FBI
[16] was also used to collect and analyse information [3],
[44]. The FBI criminal proﬁling model follows a deductive
and inductive approach. It involves the analysis of evidence
at one particular crime scene to build possible offender char-
acteristics, based on the proﬁler’s experiences and expertise.
The inductive proﬁling involves exploring detailed data on past
crimes committed of a certain type to establish correlations,
patterns, and similarities largely shared between the charac-
teristics, motivations and methods of offenders committing a
speciﬁc type of crime [3].

Finally, only one paper proposed a model for proﬁling cy-
bercriminals incorporating elements from different approaches
of proﬁling (deductive, inductive, behavioural analysis) [5].

F. Primary research contributions in the ﬁeld

Upon reviewing the selected studies, the majority provide
different types of research contributions on existing knowledge
in the ﬁeld. For a number of articles the description of
different types of offenders and the different ways they exploit
ICTs (e.g., traditional organised criminal groups, organised
cybercrime groups, and ideologically and politically motivated
cybercrime groups) is the main focus [12], [25], [31], [49].

Along the same area of research other studies explored
the organizational structures of groups involved in cybercrime
[32]–[35]. For instance, Leukfeldt et al. [34] discuss the
differences distinguished between networks carrying out low-
tech attacks and high-tech attacks as well as the different layers
of these networks such as the core members (the higher lever),
professional enablers (a layer below the core members) and
money mules (the bottom layer). Other studies approached the
topic from a different angle, analysing carding forum data to
explore the ways cybercriminals communicate and build trust
[59] and the way they network and cooperate with each other
to commit offences [7], [24].

Key ﬁndings were also found in the area of the description
of cybercrime and cybercriminals, cultural constructions of
cybercrime and cybercriminals or the culture of fear [9],
[54]. Another important area of signiﬁcant ﬁndings within
this review was on the differences between online and ofﬂine
offenders [58] as well as the exploration of online criminal be-
haviour by applying social and criminological theories related
to cybercrime [53].

However, another study [53] highlighted the differences of
the characteristics of online crimes and conventional crimes
such as proximity of the criminal to the victim and crime
location as well as the scale and size of the crime that can be
committed which is limited by physical constraints.

The motivating factors behind online criminal behaviour
was a central component of a number of studies [3], [10],
[45], [52]. These studies have identiﬁed that factors such as
political ideology, economic or social factors or the feeling of
personal accomplishment which can lead to online criminal
behaviour. Only limited work provided further contributions
in understanding cyber-offenders by exploring demographic
and contextual attributes [43], [57]. In Payne et al. [43] for

example, they found that online offenders may be younger
than all other offender types, and they are usually male or are
likely to be white.

Overall, the main aim of most studies has been to identify
the trends of cybercrime and the strategies employed by
cyber-offenders to commit cybercrime in order to identify
appropriate steps that need to be taken to prevent such criminal
activities.

IV. DISCUSSION

The main purpose of this study is to explore research
relevant to proﬁling of cybercriminals. In particular, this work
synthesises and critically reﬂects on work around understand-
ing, characterising or proﬁling cybercriminals. In this section,
the main points that have emerged from reviewing the articles
surveyed will be discussed below.

A. Study characteristics

It is not a surprise that a large proportion of studies focused
on individual cases of cybercriminals for their analysis [24],
[45], [50], [52], [53]. For example,
the analysis of cases
brought before the courts might not be representative of the
larger population of cyber-offenders who are not prosecuted.
However, gaining data by interviewing large numbers of such
offenders is extremely challenging.

In addition, studies have assessed different types of cyber-
criminals including hackers [3], [10], [15], [21], [27], [49],
[54], fraudsters [2], [11], [31], [36] and insider threats [48].
Another interesting ﬁnding is that many studies [2], [4], [5],
[9], [12], [13], [15], [18], [21], [25], [27], [46], [53]–[56] do
not work with primary data but rather rely on research from
other ﬁelds adapting it to the cybercrime domain. This is quite
interesting because it illustrates the difﬁculty in conducting
research in the ﬁeld of cybercrime due to the lack of relevant
data. It also creates a barrier to entry for new researchers who
are unable to conduct research in the ﬁeld due to the inability
to secure data access.

The lack of data might lead to incorrect assumptions espe-
cially regarding the psycho-social characteristics of offenders.
In order to bridge this gap, academics need to align their efforts
with law enforcement agencies and work towards collabora-
tions which allow secure, ethical and legal access to relevant
data. In terms of the topics of focus that these studies explored,
we noted that often a comparison between online and ofﬂine
offenders is conducted to identify differences or similarities
[?], [43], [58]. In addition, topics such as criminal motivations,
behaviours, relationships between crime and developmental
disorders, mapping criminal journeys are often in focus.

B. Deﬁnitions of cybercriminal proﬁling

Regarding deﬁning cybercriminal proﬁling, only ten of the
39 studies reviewed provided a deﬁnition of what proﬁling is
grounded in the approach that they are using.

Overall, there is a richness of deﬁnitions on proﬁling for
cyber-offenders due to the differences in motivations, skill
levels or cultural contexts. This lack of homogeneity in the

population of criminals might also justify the complexity of
exploring this ﬁeld. These reasons have resulted in a literature
that is still maturing, with more work needed to understand the
links between skills, personality traits and motivation behind
online criminal behaviour.

In addition, a number of personality or crime theories have
been utilised to understand and analyse criminal behaviour
however that is not the case for online offender behaviour. For
example, a signiﬁcant amount of work in psychology has been
conducted in relation to personality traits and crime. Eysenck’s
Theory of Crime [22] proposes a three-dimension model
(PEN) of personality: Psychoticism (anti-social, aggressive and
uncaring), Extraversion (sensation-seeking) and Neuroticism
(instability). These three personality dimensions form a unique
set of characteristics that renders an individual susceptible to
criminal behaviour. Also, given the importance of the Dark
Triad and traditional crime, the Psychoticism, Narcissism and
Machiavellianism traits have also been linked to criminal
behaviour [47].

C. Types of cybercriminal(s) researched

The review found that one of the primary types of cyber-
criminals that studies have focused on is hackers. One example
of which is a study exploring black hat hackers and offering
valuable new insights on the psychological reasoning in the
hacker’s decision-making process, during their crime life cycle
[49].

Furthermore, the majority of studies employ a general lens
while looking at the topic. In doing so, studies focus on
factors such as educational-attainment, modus-operandi, and
networks-collaborators [31], [32], [34], [35]. This general
approach once again stresses the need for more targeted
research in order to identify differences among different types
of offenders,informing law enforcement prevention activities.
Another focus in the articles reviewed is also how cybercrim-
inals communicate and build trust [59]. The ﬁndings indicate
that carding forums facilitate organised cybercrime because
they offer a hybrid form of organisational structure that is able
to address sources of uncertainty and minimise transaction
costs to an extent
that allows a competitive underground
market to emerge. Therefore, further research is necessary on
different characteristics of carding forum members such as
skills, motivation but also links to ofﬂine crime.

D. Approaches to proﬁling or understanding cybercriminals

In terms of the method, a broad range of methods were
identiﬁed such as: a) interviews; b) case studies; c) psycho-
linguistic analysis of digital communications; d) crime script
analysis; e) behavioural analysis; f) deductive or inductive
methodology to analyse the information; g) FBI’s criminal
proﬁling framework; h) mathematical framework, construct-
ing typologies for organised cybercriminal networks; and i)
geographic-mathematic framework analysis.

However, the majority of papers used the deductive ap-
proach as a preferred one. This is mainly due to the fact
that it is more applicable to case-based studies, in which the

crime, attack or threat is analysed and speciﬁc characteristics
of the perpetrator are explored. That is due to the lack of
large available data-sets to be analysed systematically or over
time. For example, Action Fraud in the UK is collecting
information on victims of cybercrime however, the focus in
not on offenders.

As mentioned above, one of the most well-known ap-
proaches in proﬁling is the FBI’s criminal proﬁling framework.
This approach has been applied to proﬁle hackers, by analysing
information such as the date of incident, demographic char-
acteristics of the hacker, motives, presence of an accomplice,
attack tools, and whether the attack happened locally only or
internationally [3]. Although, this approach is being applied to
provide insights on online behaviour, still the characteristics
of the hacker are mainly demographics, lacking the social and
psychological insights that various studies have been exploring
for decades in ofﬂine criminal behaviour.

It

is also identiﬁed that researchers are selecting some
parts of speciﬁc frameworks which they ﬁnd appropriate to
analyse the type of data they have collected or analysing.
For example, a study [32] has selected some aspects of an
analytical framework [28] used to systematically analyse cases
of organised crime. The selected aspects of the framework
were ties between members of networks, processes of origin
and growth, the composition of the network, its structure, the
dependencies, the background of members, social ties and the
(digital) offender convergence settings used by the criminals.

E. Primary research contributions in the ﬁeld

1) Data used: Studies followed different methods in data
collection in examining the proﬁles of cyber-offenders. Some
studies have attempted to construct typologies for organised
cybercriminal networks, other studies explored the organiza-
tional structures of groups involved in cybercrime, while others
analysed carding forum data to explore the ways cybercrimi-
nals communicate and build trust or the way they network and
cooperate with each other to commit offences.

2) Working with law enforcement: It has also been identi-
ﬁed that for some studies the engagement with law enforce-
ment was necessary. Some researchers have interviewed law
enforcement ofﬁcers and detectives [24], [31], [33]–[35] as a
way of capturing the experience and knowledge of computer
crime or fraud specialists. Other studies have focused on
analysing police investigation ﬁles [35]. The role of law
enforcement is really important is conducting research in this
ﬁeld. For example, the UK’s National Crime Agency supported
research exploring autism and cyber-dependent crime [44].

3) Theoretical approaches in proﬁling: An important area
of signiﬁcant contributions in the ﬁeld is the study of the
differences between online and ofﬂine offenders [58] as well
as the exploration of online criminal behaviour by applying
social and criminological theories related to cybercrime [53].
We found however that there is very limited work looking
at personality aspects in relation to cybercrime. The main
contribution in understanding online offenders is mainly done
by exploring demographic and contextual attributes as well

as motivations [43]. In Payne et al. [43] for example, they
found that online offenders may be younger than all other
offender types, and they are usually male or are likely to
be white. However, studies on ofﬂine crime have pointed
to personality as being a signiﬁcant predictor of criminality,
estimated at twice the size of the more commonly touted factor
of social class background effects [51]. For example, a study
[14] applied the Five Factor Model identifying agreeableness
and conscientiousness as additional personality factors which
should be considered when building a personality proﬁle of
ofﬂine criminals. In addition, low self-control has been linked
to online criminal behaviour as it characterises individuals
being impulsive, insensitive, risk-taking and fail to consider
the long-term consequences of their actions [23]. Also, studies
have linked personality to insider threat cases [39].

4) New method development: There are only a small
number of studies suggesting new methods or developing a
framework to proﬁle online offenders incorporating both the
inductive as well as the deductive proﬁling approaches [5],
[55]. However, only one study from the ones selected for
this review proposed a model for proﬁling cybercriminals
incorporating elements from different approaches of proﬁling
(deductive, inductive, behavioural analysis) [5]. In the past
studies have suggested theoretical models such as the theoret-
ical model proﬁle of a hacker [38] aiming to indicate relations
between the offender’s characteristics, the environment and
her/his success and the modus operandi during the attack.

5) Gaps and policy implications: The ﬁndings from the
studies reviewed have identiﬁed the current gaps around
understanding the psychology of online criminal behaviour
and the prevention of cybercrime and stressed potential policy
implications [21]. It has been identiﬁed that there is a need for
new strategies of response and further research on analysing
organised criminal activities in cyberspace [12]. In addition,
the fact that digital evidence will be used more in judicial pro-
ceedings in the future, stresses the need for law enforcement
to have in-depth knowledge of computer forensic principles,
guidelines, procedures, tools, and techniques [12].

Another identiﬁed aspect for further research is the study of
the characteristics of both the offender and offense to predict
the societal reaction of the jurisdiction system on computer
assisted frauds. Examining criminal capacity and culpability
and identifying how the characteristics of the offender and
offense itself might affect the application of law has been
identiﬁed as something currently lacking [36].

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Our review considered the salient characteristics of cur-
rent studies, information on cybercriminals, their actions and
behaviour, and crucially,
the methods used to proﬁle and
understand such offenders. Based on our review, it is clear that
there is steady growth in research into cyber-offender proﬁling.
There are, however, some areas where research is lacking. We
discuss these below.

Common deﬁnitions: Future research should be looking
more closely on accepting a common deﬁnition on cybercrimi-

nal proﬁling. One example which may form the basis for future
discussions is “cybercriminal proﬁling is an educated attempt
to provide speciﬁc information as to the type of individual who
committed a certain crime. A proﬁle based on characteristics
patterns or factors of uniqueness that distinguishes certain
individuals from the general population” [55].

Common Approach: Future research should give sufﬁcient
attention on a more common approach of cybercriminal pro-
ﬁling so that it can be tested and applied in a systematic
way. This way more standardised methods can be developed
speciﬁcally for studying online criminal behaviour.

Personality traits and online criminal behaviour: Factors
including personality traits must be further researched whilst
exploring online criminal behaviour and how they inﬂuence
the pathway a person can choose towards delinquency or not.
Lack of data: The difﬁculty in conducting research in this
ﬁeld is the lack of large data sets that can be analysed as well
as the lack of access in such data. In addition, currently there
is lack of relevant data collected by law enforcement agencies.
Future studies would focus more on establishing collaborations
with law enforcement agencies, informing their practises and
data collection approaches.

Wider focus: Future research looking at proﬁling of
cybercriminals should employ a wider focus of types of
offenders. Currently,
there seems to be a lot of research
focused on hackers or cyber crimes in general, but not on
other speciﬁc types such as on hacktivists [26]. Future studies
could also address the limitation of this study, by including
non-academic sources
in future analysis or examining
potential geographic discrepancies in proﬁling deﬁnitions and
methodology used.
