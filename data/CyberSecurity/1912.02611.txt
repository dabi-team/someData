Abstract. Power systems are growing rapidly, due to ever-increasing demand for 
electrical  power.  These  systems  require  novel  methodologies  and  modern  tools 
and technologies, to better perform, particularly for communication among differ-
ent parts. Therefore, power systems are facing new challenges such as energy trad-
ing and marketing and cyber threats. Using blockchain in power systems, as a so-
lution,  is  one  of  the  newest  methods.  Most  studies  aim  to  investigate  innovative 
approaches of blockchain application in power systems. Even though, many arti-
cles  published  to  support  the  research  activities,  there  has  not  been  any  biblio-
metric analysis  which specifies the research  trends. This paper aims to present a 
bibliographic analysis of the blockchain application in power systems related liter-
ature,  in  the  Web  of  Science  (WoS)  database  between  January  2009  and  July 
2019 . This paper discusses the research activities and performed a detailed analy-
sis by looking at the number of articles published, citations, institutions,  research 
area, and authors. From the analysis, it was concluded that there are several signif-
icant  impacts  of  research  activities  in  China  and  USA,  in  comparison  to  other 
countries.

Introduction 

Power systems are experiencing swift changes due to the rapid growth of elec-
tricity demand, which is expected to grow further by around 30% in 2035 [1], [2]. 
While,  power  systems    are  facing  challenges  because  of    new  technology  devel-
opments, security concerns, new market patterns, consumer demand changes, etc. 

2  

[3], [4]. There  are  some  permanent  challenges  such  as  stability,  reliability,  envi-
ronmental concerns, and costs [5]. 

Various type of methods have been employed over the years for solving prob-
lems  in  different  sections  and  improving  the  performance  of  the  power  systems 
[3], [6], [7]–[15], but some of these problems are related to the growing network 
and its integration. Due to using distributed generation in power systems (which is 
one of the main reasons for network growth) and using communication tools and 
smart  meters,  marketing and  communication in power networks require new and 
up-to-date methods. It should be noted power systems are on the edge of entering 
the digital era by a massive deployment of in most countries in the world [3], [16]. 
Figure.1 shows the summary of the content discussed. 

Fig. 1 Power system changes and challenges 

Central  management  and  operation  are  becoming  ever  more  challenging  be-
cause of the need for an advanced communication and data exchanges among dif-
ferent parts of the power network [17]. On the other hand, the decentralization of 
the property, and the decision-making process are complex which are evolving the 
Information Technologies [18], [19]. Thus, to accommodate these decentralization 
and digitalization trends, local distributed control and management techniques are 
in need [20]. The importance of this issue has led many researchers to seek new 
methodologies and concepts to improve the performance and security of the power 
systems [8], [13], [21], [22]. Application of blockchain is one of the newest ones. 

Blockchain,  also  called  distributed  ledger,  is  a  technology,  by  a  set  of  nodes 
that  do  not  fully  trust  each  other,  which  first  was  proposed  in  2008  [23],  [24]  . 
This technology is designed to secure data storage and transfer through decentral-
ized,  trustless,  peer-to-peer  systems  with  no  participation  of  a  third  party  which 
records  transactions  of  value  using  a  cryptographic  signature  [23],  [25],  [26]. 
Blockchain  started  from  cryptocurrency,  grew  in  assets  and  credit  field,  and  in-
creasingly found its place in information and communication field. Various indus-
tries have realized the value of the blockchain and how this technology is secure 
and  reliable as a technical solution. This technical  solution allows  users to con-
tribute jointly in data computing, storage, authenticity verification and the preserv-
ing the reliable database [27], [28].

Early research shows that blockchain technology could potentially  provide so-
lutions to some of the challenges faced by power systems and it can be used for 
different concepts of the power system due to the decentralized structure (e.g. pri-
vacy  and  security,  energy  trading  and  marketing,  using  new  communication  and 
smart tools). Regarding privacy and security in power systems, Kanhere et al. [29] 
applied blockchain to Direct Load Control to protect user privacy and security of 
communications.  Yang  et  al.  [30]  proposed  an  algorithm,  applied  to  a  self-
organized cyber-physical power system,  which  has short blockchain construction 
time and achieves better data block exchange performance. G. Liang [31] showed 
how blockchain technology can be used to enhance the robustness and security of 
the power grid. 

In terms of energy trading and marketing, recently, blockchain has been an in-
teresting topic for many researchers and companies. Aitzhan and Svetinovic  [32] 
proposed using blockchain to build a decentralized energy trading system. To se-
cure the energy trading transactions in their token-based system, multi-signatures 
and anonymous encrypted message propagation streams were used. K. Mannaro et 
al.  [33]  developed  a  blockchain-based  platform  to  recommend  the  best  trading 
strategy for prosumers in the renewable energy market. 

In  addition,  some  blockchain  projects  have  focused  on  energy  trading 
,especially  renewable  energy,  and  smart  tools.  It  should  be  noted,  most  of  these 
projects  are  still  in  the  testing  phase  or  under  development.  The  PWR.Company 
developed  Ethereum-based  solutions  for  trading  renewable  energy  and  installed 
deep cycle batteries for consumers for power storage to stabilize the grid, instead 
of  selling  the  energy  immediately.  SolarCoin,  PowerLedger,  Key2Energy  and 
TheSunExchange  aim  is  to  increase  solar  energy  production  and  facilitate  the 
trade  of  this  type  of  energy  [34].  NRGcoin  [35]  is  currently  at  the  conceptual 
stage, uses smart contracts framework which is based on Ethereum for trading an 
energy-based  cryptocurrency.  Regardless  of  the  retail  value  of  electricity,  one 
NRGcoin is equivalent to one kWh. Share&Charge  [36] developed a network of 
electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and owners of charging stations can regis-
ter their station and set tariffs for charging. Finally, some projects are focused on 
smart metering tools for increasing the performance of power systems in fields of 
energy trading and privacy and security such as Bankymoon [37] and  the Electron 
company [38]. these examples demonstrate  that the  research activities conducted 
in  this  field  are  significant.  However,  no  bibliometric  analysis  has  been  done  to 
report the impacts and trends of such researches. 

Bibliometric allows researchers to understand the characteristics, structure, and 
patterns of research activities. Also, the research activities are combined into a re-
alistic trend of a research domain by this statistical analysis.  This involves litera-
ture  studies  of  scientific  activities  in  different  contexts  such  as  publications,  au-
thors,  institutions,  citations,  and  countries.  Moreover,  this  method  reports  on  the 
comprehensive evaluation of the expansion of research fields [39]. 

The purpose of this study is to well understand the state-of-the-art application 
of blockchain in power systems. It is vital to identify top-tier researchers, organi-

 
4  

zation and institutes, and collaboration amongst them as well as hot topics. To ad-
dress these questions, we aim to make a bibliometric analysis on relevant papers 
published in the Web of Science from 2009 to 2019. 

The outline of this paper is as follows. We present the research method in Sec-
tion 2. Thereafter in Section 3 findings and information about using blockchain in 
power systems are presented. Section 4 is the conclusion to the study. 

2.  Methodology 

The citation analysis in academic papers was initiated by Garfield [40]. Bibli-
ometrics was defined by Pritchard as the application of mathematics and statistical 
methods  to  books  and  other  media  of  communication  and  is  the  oldest  research 
methods in library and information science [41]. Bibliometric contains various ap-
plications from information science, sociology and history of science to research 
evaluation [42]. This method is used to evaluate, monitor and visualize the struc-
ture  of  scientific  fields  [43].  Bibliometric  methods  can  be  divided  in  two  parts: 
general instructions and publication analysis. For general instructions, researchers 
show how to avoid possible sources of error in the search process by showing how 
to  search  article  using  a  search  engine.  However,  the  evaluation  of  publication 
such  as  impact  factor,  citations,  publisher,  and  country  described  in  publication 
analysis  [39].  In  general,  citation  analysis  and  content  analysis  are  two  widely 
used  bibliometric  methods.  Citation  analysis  helps  to  identify  core  literatures, 
journals, countries, etc., and shows a relationship between citing and cited works 
in a research area [44]. For examples M. Dabbagh [45] studied the Evolution of 
Blockchain, and analyzed scientific production of Geographical Information Sys-
tem (GIS) in Web of Science, and WL.Woon et al.  [46] presented a bibliometric 
based  study  on  distributed  generation.  Three  main  bibliometrics  data  sources  for 
searching  the  literature  are  Web  of  Science,  Scopus,  Google  Scholar.  These 
sources are generally used to  rank journals in terms of their productivity and the 
total citation received to indicate the journal impact, prestige or influence.  In this 
paper, the WoS data is selected to complete the bibliometric analysis based on the 
following reasons. 

Web of science is the most famous tool for bibliometrics analysis and until the 
creation  of  Scopus  and  Google  Scholar  in  2004  [47],  and  it  used  to  be  the  only 
tool and contains great  features. This bibliometrics tool has over 12,000 titles of 
journals since 1900 to present, covers 45 Languages, and provides citation analy-
sis  by  author,  country,  document  type,  institution,  language,  publication  year, 
source title, subject area and funding information. Web of Science contains cita-
tion  maps  which  helps  to  visualize  the  result  of  the  citing  references.  The  cited 
reference search in WOS is a unique feature that cannot be found in any other da-
tabases  [48].  In  addition,  94%  of  Scopus  highest  impact  factor journals  were  in-
dexed in WoS [49]. 

 
5 

After  using  Web  of  Science  as  the  search  engine  of  this  study,  we  identified 
some  related  keywords  to  start  the  process  of  extracting  papers.  There  are  some 
equivalent for Blockchain such as distributed ledger and cryptocurrency [50]. Al-
so,  the  power  network  sometimes  named  by  power  network  or  electrical  power 
system [51]. So, the inquiry to collect the data for bibliometric analysis was as fol-
lows: (TS = ((Blockchain OR Distributed ledger OR Cryptocurrency) AND (Pow-
er System OR Power Network OR Electrical Power Network))). The time period 
for this study, was limited to the past decade (between 2009  and 2019). As a re-
sult, we detected a total of 291 publications from various journals, books, confer-
ences,  and  patterns.  For  this  analysis,  two  following  databases  were  selected: 
“Web of Science Core Collection” and “Current Contents Connect” . To remove 
unrelated publications such as patterns and non-English publications, we excluded 
other databases. As a result, 271 articles were secured for this analysis’ purposes. 
This process is shown in Figure 2  . The criteria of this bibliometric analysis are: 
(a)  productivity,  (b)  research  areas,  (c)  institutions,  (d)  authors,  (e)  Impact  Pub-
lishers,(f) highly cited articles and (g) keyword frequency. Figure 2 is provided for 
illustration. It should be noted, there is no result before 2014. So, in the rest of this 
research, presented results will be limited to 2014-2019.

3.  Findings 

In  this  section,  we  discuss  the  finding  of  the  bibliometric  analysis  for  block-
chain  application  in  power  systems.  The  results  detect  high-quality  research  to 
support researchers enhancing research in this field. Finding section is divided into 
7  sub-topics:  productivity,  research  areas,  institutions,  impact  journals,  authors, 
highly cited articles and keyword frequency. Fig. 3 shows the number of publica-
tions between 2014–2019. 

Fig. 3 The Number of publications 

Figure 3 shows three categories of publications including journals, conferences, 
and other types (reviews, editorials and abstracts) which are extracted from vari-
ous  studies  related  to  blockchain  application  in  power  systems.  The  conference 
category has the highest proportion of the total publications by 56.16% in this time 
period. However, in 2019, as of 21st-Jun-2019, the share of articles has been about 
79.5%  (30  of  39)  which  shows  a  significant  increase  in  this  type  of  documents. 
This  value  for  2018  was  43.2%.  It  is  more  likely  that  the  journal  publications 
would increase even more in the remaining of 2019. 

As it mentioned previously, citation analysis is used to recognize the frequency 
of  the  journals  and  to  evaluate  researchers'  performance.  Also,  this  analysis  pro-
vides an overview of the topic studied and information about researchers to other 
researchers using common references. It has been realizing that there are two ma-
jor types of publications in the academic research study. These publications focus-
ing  on  originality  and  developers  of  the  contents  to  show  the  significance  of  re-
search.

The citation is a way of showing the evidence of material in the publications to 
illustrate the increasing number of research activities that contributed to the high 
impact of publications. Figure 4 demonstrates the citations received by the publi-
cations  over  the  last  6  years.  As  the  number  of  publications  has  increased  the 
number of citations has been also increased. The earlier publication which stays in 
the database for a longer period of time, has the higher chance to be cited. The av-
erage number of citations is about 218 annually during 2014 – 2018. The number 
of annual citations shows a positive trend with a distinct peak occurring in 2018. 
The  citation  has  increased  by  about  five-fold  in  2018  when  compared  to  2017. 
Given that the study was conducted in June 2019, it is expected to see the number 
of citations to be higher than 2018 for 2019.

3.1. Productivity 

The productivity of the countries, which refers to the frequency or the number 
of publications, is presented in this section. A study of productivity growth of arti-
cles reflects the attentions and overall strength of different countries in the related 
research fields. It also shows strengthen of the research mechanisms while leading 
research involving analysis on blockchain application in power systems. The focus 
on  productivity  analysis  helps  to  enhance  and  improve  the  production  efficiency 
of the publications. This also assesses which countries have produced more publi-
cations. 

Figure 5 shows that  China and the United States are the lead countries  in the 
number  of  publications  and  data  show  these  two  countries  contributed  to  almost 

 
 
8  

half of the entire publications related to blockchain application in power systems. 
As Table 1 shows, this is followed by South Korea, England, and Australia.

3.2. Research areas 

To  measure  the  research  performance  based  on  citation  and  publication  rates, 
researchers use research areas which shows the trend of the publication over time. 
Research areas develop a logical understanding of explicit research areas and how 
these  challenge  other  areas  in  different  sectors  of  the  industries.  Table  2  shows 
more details about research areas. 

Table 2 shows that the majority of the publications fall under computer science 
and  engineering  areas.  In  this  regard,  computer  science  and  engineering  are  the 
two main research areas for blockchain application in power systems.

3.3. Institutions 

This  section  discusses  the  number  of  publications  noted  according  to  various 
institutions and measures different institution’s quality according to their publica-
tions.  Also,  it  identifies  which  of  these  institutions  are  currently  active.  Table  3 
lists the institutions which conducted research related to blockchain application in 
power systems. The table shows that institutions in China in total have the highest 
number of publications. According to this table, the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
and Nanyang Technological  University  have  the  highest  number of publications. 
The  most  prominent  institutions  in  Asia  are  located  in  China.  It  seems  that  the 
speed of publication about using blockchain in power systems, in China is much 
faster  than  the  other  countries  in  the  world.  This  evidence  suggests  that  there  is 
keen competition among institutions across China in terms publications.

3.4. Authors 

This section discusses the number of publications noted according to authors in 
various countries to identify who is the most active in terms of authorship. Table 4 
lists the findings for authors who are the most productive. As the table illustrates, 
the majority of the authors are from China, Australia, Denmark, Italy, and Singa-
pore. It appears some other countries such as Greece, Canada, Norway, and Japan 
are also able to contribute to many publications.

3.5. Publishers 

This section discusses the list of publishers which published the most publica-
tions about blockchain application in power systems. This section is important as 
it  shows  the  most  leading  journals,  conferences,  and  book  series  in  publications 
and the ones which have the highest citations. This information helps researchers 
to  identify  the  high-quality  journals  and  conferences  to  strengthen  their  work  by 
publishing in them. Table 5 lists some publishers titles with the greatest number of 
publications in the field. It shows that the greatest number of publications belongs 
to the IEEE Access journal and Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences book series 
and followed by other journals such as Energies and Sensors. 

Table 5 demonstrates that IEEE Journals and Conferences are major publishers 
in terms of blockchain application in power systems. It shows that Lecture Notes 
in Computer Science received 67051 citations over the years followed by Applied 
Energy and Sensors  with 42891 and 25150 citations respectively. This table also 
illustrates that journals with dominant citations per document by a remarkable dif-
ference  from  the  rest,  are  IEEE  Internet  of  Things  Journal,  Applied  Energy,  and 
IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics. As a  whole, the quality of high im-
pact journals attracts researchers to publish their articles because it widely read by 
the other researcher and increases their citations.

3.6. Highly-cited articles 

This  section  illustrates  the  quality  and  influence  of  research  done  in  using 
blockchain  in  power  systems  by  assessing  the  number  of  citations  received  by 
each publication. Table 6 lists the top 15 most cited publications, number of times 
cited, type to about 5.53% of the total publications. Moreover, the top highly-cited 
publication was published 4 years ago, showing compliance with the concept that 
the longer the publications have been in the database, the higher the number of ci-
tations accumulated. Even though the blockchain is a new advent technology and 
there  is  no  publication  about  blockchain  application  in  power  systems  prior  to 
2014, the number of citations for publications in this field is high. 

Of  the  articles  published  ,  the  most  cited  was  “Blockchain  technology  in  the 
chemical industry: Machine-to-machine electricity market”. This paper investigat-
ed blockchain application and presented a scenario including two electricity pro-
ducers and one electricity consumer trading with together based on blockchain. It 
can be concluded that highly cited articles are high quality research in which the 
researcher recognizes other author's findings, ideas, methods, and influence in cer-
tain fields. As a whole, if the topic in articles is more interesting, it increases jour-
nal citations particularly when the subject is more special.

3.7. Keywords frequency 

This  section  discusses  the  type  of  keywords  which  are  frequently  used  by  re-
searchers. These keywords could be used to analyze and identify research trends 
and gaps. Table 7 provides a list of  unique  keywords and title occurrences. This 
list was derived from a total of 5,958 keywords and 701 titles that had appeared in 
271 publications between 2014 and 2019. 

Table 7  shows that the most relevant title and keyword is blockchain. This ta-
ble also shows that blockchain and power system are consistently used in the liter-
ature.

To provide an in-depth analysis, Figure 6 presents a word map based on a con-
tent analysis of the publications. According to this map, the keywords are divided 
into 3 clusters in which two clusters are more specific. One of these clusters high-
lighted by key terms which are related to “cryptocurrency”, “bitcoin”, “protocol”, 
“attack”, “reward” and another one contains  keywords such as “microgrid”, “en-
ergy”,  “market”,  “electric  vehicle”.  In  addition,  ‘‘power  system’’,  “blockchain”, 
and “energy” were noted as terms that act as links between the research topics.

4.  Conclusions 

In this paper, we used WoS as the literature source for the bibliometric analysis 
of  blockchain  application  in  power  system  from  January  2014  to  June  21, 2019. 
Seven criteria including productivity, research areas, institutions, authors, impact 
publishers,  highly  cited  articles,  and  keyword  frequency  have  been  used  in  this 
study. Using these criteria, we uncovered the global trends and frontiers related to 
our subject. Between 2014 and 2018, it was noted that the number of publications 
related to blockchain application in power system had increased with an average 
annual  growth rate  of 418%. The analysis also indicated that the trend of block-
chain publications experienced speedy progress with increased article publications 
and citations during this time period. 

It  was  noted  that  China  and  the  United  States  are  the  lead  countries  with  the 
most publications produced in academic research. Then, we showed that the ma-
jority of the publications fall under computer science and engineering. 

Our analysis  had indicated that IEEE Journals and  Conferences  are the  major 
publishers  in  terms  of  blockchain  application  in  power  systems.  This  study  also 
highlighted  the  active  authors  in  terms  of  publications  in  different  countries. 
Among the top 15 most active authors, there are 10 authors with 4 publications in 
this  field.  Finally,  a  map  analysis  of  keyword  frequencies  had  been  used  to  de-
scribe the trends and research directions for future studies in blockchain applica-
tion in power system field.
