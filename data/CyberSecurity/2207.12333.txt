Abstract—The integration of synchronous generators and en-
ergy storage systems operated through communication networks
introduces new challenges and vulnerabilities to the electric grid,
where cyber attacks can corrupt sensor measurements or control
inputs and interrupt functions such as frequency regulation. This
paper proposes a defense methodology for the design of resilient
operating constraints imposed on each generation and storage
unit in order to prevent any attack sequence from driving the
system’s frequency to unsafe conditions. The resilient operating
constraints are found by using ellipsoidal approximations of
leading to a convex
the reachable set of the power system,
optimization problem with linear matrix inequalities. Numerical
results in a single-area power system with synchronous generation
and energy storage demonstrate how the resilient constraints
provide security guarantees against any type of attack affecting
frequency measurements or controller setpoints.

attacks.

I. INTRODUCTION

The integration and coordination of synchronous generators
and energy storage systems (ESS) in power grids have the
potential to increase the reliability and stability of the grid.
However,
to fully harness the potential beneﬁts of ESS,
it is necessary to integrate monitoring and communication
technologies that can make the power system vulnerable to
cyber attacks that aim to disrupt
its operation [1]. These
vulnerabilities have become more evident in the last couple
of years where several cyber attacks have affected power
systems. For instance, a synchronized and coordinated cyber
attack compromised three Ukrainian regional electric power
distribution companies, resulting in power outages affecting
approximately 225,000 customers for several hours [2]. Simi-
larly, a denial-of-service attack left grid operators temporarily
blinded to generation sites of several dozens of wind and solar
farms in the U.S. [3].

A signiﬁcant amount of effort has been made to address
different cyber-security challenges in power systems. For in-
stance, authors in [4] utilize multiple unknown input observers
to detect any discrepancy in frequency deviations and identify
the system parameters that were corrupted. Ganjkhani et al.,
[5] present a novel anomaly detection and localization strategy
that uses deep neural networks to differentiate between faults
and cyber attacks, and simultaneously ﬁnd the location of
the affected line or device in the power distribution system.
Similarly, in [6], a real-time reference model that mimics
the nonlinear and complex behavior of power distribution

networks is used to detect false-data injection attacks through
the computation of residuals and a chi-square detection score.
On the other hand, to minimize the social and economical
costs caused by cyber attacks in power systems, the grid must
be not only secure to prevent or detect intrusions, but also
resilient to withstand successful attacks [7]. Cyber resilience
of the power grid refers to the capability of maintaining critical
functionality of the grid in the presence of cyber attacks [8],
[9]. Few works have proposed mechanisms that enhance the
resilience of the power grid in the face of cyber threats. In
[10], authors introduce a resilient power sharing mechanism
that is able to cancel the inﬂuence of attacks affecting the
controller computation by using state observers to estimate the
attacker’s action. Similarly, authors in [11] utilize input and
state estimators to detect and compensate the effects of cyber
attacks in sensor measurements intended for the computation
of the automatic generation control (AGC) setpoints. Diaz-
Garcia et al., [12] propose a methodology to redesign the
communication network of distributed control in the power
grid in order to reduce the impact caused by false-data
injection attacks. Authors in [13] introduce a decentralized
moving-target defense methodology that is able to reduce the
impact of cyber attacks by replicating relevant signals and
selecting them randomly.

Three major limitations are identiﬁed from previous work.
First, anomaly detection and mitigation are not sufﬁcient to
guarantee system security, because it is not possible to design
algorithms that can detect all types of attacks. Second, most
of the contributions found in the literature are tailored for very
speciﬁc types of attacks that lack the generality needed in real
applications where it is hard to make assumptions about the
attacker’s actions. Finally, the existent solutions to enhance
resiliency focus mostly on modifying a control algorithm or
the communication network architecture to make the system
less susceptible to certain attacks. However, they do not offer
any guarantee that the system can remain operating in safe
conditions for a wide range of attack scenarios.

In this paper, the aforementioned limitations are addressed
in order to guarantee the resilience of power systems affected
by cyber attacks. To this end, in this work we propose a novel
methodology that uses the dynamic model of the power grid to
ﬁnd optimal resilient operating constraints for generation units
and energy storage systems that ensure that no attack affecting
the AGC setpoints directly (e.g., tampering communication
between the control center and local controllers) or indirectly

(e.g., compromising frequency measurements used to compute
the area control error (ACE)) can drive the system to unsafe
states, i.e., those states that threaten system stability and may
lead to equipment damage or even large-scale blackouts. One
of the main beneﬁts of the proposed approach is that it is
agnostic to the type of controller, the type of attack, and does
not require any prior assumption about the attacker’s capabil-
ities. The exact computation of these constraints becomes an
NP-hard combinatorial problem when the range of operation
of the generation and storage units and the system states are
assumed to be continuous (i.e., bounded inﬁnite sets); however,
we overcome these issues by using ellipsoidal approxima-
tions of the reachable set, simplifying the complexity of the
optimization problem and allowing the use of linear matrix
inequalities (LMI) that can be efﬁciently solved using interior-
point methods for semideﬁnite programming.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion II introduces the power grid dynamic model. Section
III presents the proposed optimization problem to ﬁnd the
resilient operating constraints of each synchronous generator
and energy storage system. The numerical results are presented
in Section IV, and the conclusions are drawn in Section V.

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

A. Dynamic Model of the Power Grid

Consider the system in Fig. 1, which consists of a set of
dispatchable synchronous generators NG = {1, . . . , nG} that
combine bulk generation and small generators (e.g., diesel
generators, small-hydro power plants), and a set of energy
storage systems NES = {1, . . . , nES}, where each one may
represent individual or aggregated energy storage units. The
AGC manages generation units and energy storage in order
to maintain the frequency deviations within safe limits after
disturbances caused by loads and renewable energy resources.
Let ∆PG = [∆PG,1, . . . , ∆PG,nG ](cid:62), denote the deviation
of the generated power with respect to a scheduled setpoint
for each dispatchable synchronous generator. Similarly, let
∆PES = [∆PES,1, . . . , ∆PES,nES ] denote the deviation of
the charging/discharging scheduled setpoint for each energy
storage unit. The change in the aggregated load is denoted as
∆PL. Renewable energy resources (e.g., solar/wind genera-
tors) can contribute to supply part of the demand, such that
the change of the aggregated renewable resources is denoted as
∆PRES. Both, ∆PL, ∆PRES are unknown uncertainties for
the system. The control setpoints computed by the AGC are
UG = [UG,1, . . . , UG,nG ](cid:62) and UES = [UES,1, . . . UES,nES ].
The frequency deviation in the system is then dictated by
the aggregated inertia and damping coefﬁcients M and D,
respectively, and is described as follows

for the AGC setpoint computation or directly AGC setpoints sent to the
different generation and storage units.

The active power deviation of each synchronous generator
j ∈ NG can be modeled using a ﬁrst order dynamic equation
of the form [14], [15]:

where ∆Xgov = [∆Xgov,1, . . . , ∆Xgov,nG ](cid:62) denotes the
change in the governor position, Tt,j
is the turbine time
constant, Tg,j is governor time constant, Rj is speed regulation
gain from the primary frequency control. Even though our
results can be easily extended for other generation models such
as hydropower plants [16] or steam units [15], for simplicity
we focus on synchronous generators that can be described by
(2). The deviation of the absorbed/injected power provided by
the energy storage systems can be described as follows:

∆PES,i = −

where TES,i is a time constant that represents the transient
between the received setpoint and the actual injected/absorbed
power. For most storage systems TES,i
is small due the
capability of ESS to quickly deliver/absorb power.

Let x ∈ Rn with x = [∆f, ∆P (cid:62)

gov, ∆PES](cid:62) denote
the system states, u ∈ Rm, with u = [U (cid:62)
ES](cid:62) denotes
the control input, and ω ∈ R with ω = ∆PL − ∆PRES cor-
responds to the external unknown disturbance. The combined
dynamics can be described in a compact form as follows:

G , U (cid:62)

˙x(t) = Acx(t) + Bcu(t) + Hcω(t),

(4)

with matrices AC, Bc, H of proper dimension. Given that the
AGC setpoints are typically computed every τ seconds (e.g.,
typically 2-5 s), in the remaining of this work we will focus
on discrete-time dynamics. However, the simulation results
will be tested on a continuous-time model with piece-wise
continuous control commands updated every τ seconds.

B. Adversary Model

In this paper, we consider a powerful adversary that knows
the system dynamics (i.e., matrices A, B, H), can compromise
any type of measurements and/or all AGC setpoints, and has
the ability to change them arbitrarily. The attacker is not con-
strained to follow speciﬁc attacks such as replay, delay, scaling
or bias attacks previously considered in the literature, but
instead can inject any type of attack sequence. The attacker’s
goal is to force the system to operate in unsafe conditions
that may potentially damage the system equipment or cause
a large-scale blackout. These strong assumptions will allow
us to design a defense mechanism that is able to withstand
any type of attack, either on sensor measurements or AGC
setpoints, which will lead to provable security guarantees.

III. RESILIENT OPERATING CONSTRAINTS

The power system dynamics described above depend on the
AGC setpoints, u(k), and the unknown external disturbance
ω(k). The execution of each control input ui(k) is bounded
according to physical constraints speciﬁc to each type of
|ui(k)| ≤ γi, for
generator or energy storage, such that
γi > 0 and i = 1, . . . , m. For instance, a diesel generator
can generate up to a limited amount of power depending on
its physical characteristics; a battery can absorb/inject power
with maximum and minimum power ratings depending on its
construction. Similarly, load deviations caused by changes in
the electricity consumption and the power supplied by RES are
bounded according to physical limits, such that |ω(k)| ≤ γω.
Despite these physical constraints, it is possible for cyber
attackers to design attack sequences that drive the system states
to unsafe operation conditions (e.g., frequencies deviations
above/below 0.2 Hz). In fact, the integration of ESS may
increase the attacker’s surface making the power grid more
susceptible to cyber attack impacts. For instance, if an attacker
that manipulates an ESS sends charging commands during
high electricity demand, it may cause power imbalances that
lead to dangerous frequency deviations. Therefore,
in this
work, new operating constraints imposed on each generator
and ESS will be designed (see Fig. 1) to guarantee that the
power grid can withstand any attack sequence, either in sensor
measurements or control commands. To this end, ideas related
to the “reachable set” will be adopted, which have been widely
studied for deﬁning the stability of dynamic systems, and then
a convex optimization problem will be formulated to ﬁnd the
optimal resilient operating constraints.

Fig. 2.
Illustration of the proposed methodology using the reachable set and
its ellipsoidal approximation. The resilient operating constraints are designed
to guarantee that unsafe states are not reachable by any potentially malicious
control input.

A. Reachable Set Approximation

The reachable set with respect to the system states x can be
deﬁned as the set of all admissible x that satisfy the physical
constraints, described as follows:

R :=



the states that
Note that
the reachable set contains all
can be reached by any combination of
input sequences
u(0), u(1), . . . , u(k), . . . and ω(0), ω(1), . . . , ω(k), . . .. There-
fore, the reachable set provides valuable information about any
system states that can be attained by potential attack sequences
that AGC setpoints.

It is possible to estimate the reachable set R by ﬁnding
points that satisfy the equality and inequality constraints.
However, since each ui and ω can take values in a continuous
space, R is an inﬁnite set, and computing the exact reachable
set (or at least a very good approximation) is difﬁcult and com-
putationally costly when the number of variables increases.
For this reason, we will exploit some properties from control
theory and convex optimization to ﬁnd the smallest ellipsoid
E(W ) that contains the reachable set, i.e., R ⊆ E(W ).

Typically, an ellipsoid of dimension n can be described in

a quadratic form as follows:

E(W ) := (cid:8)x ∈ Rn | xT W −1x ≤ 1(cid:9) ,

(7)

where W ∈ Rn×n is a positive-deﬁnite matrix. Figure 2 (left)
illustrates an example of the ellipsoidal approximation that
contains the reachable set. Notice that the reachable set may
overlap unsafe states. These unsafe states represent the set of
system states that are dangerous and must be avoided, e.g.,
∆f (t) ≥ 0.2 Hz or ∆f (t) ≤ −0.2 Hz. In other words, if
the reachable set overlaps with the unsafe states, it implies
that there exist attack sequences that can drive the power grid
to unsafe states. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to
ﬁnd new resilient constraints for each generator and ESS such
that the reachable set does not overlap the unsafe states, as
illustrated in Fig. 2 (right).

B. Finding the Resilient Operating Constraints

Using tools from control theory and convex optimization
we will expand the methodology introduced in [17], [18] to
approximate the entire reachable set with an ellipsoid E(W ).

Then, a new group of input constraints will be designed to
“shrink” the reachable set in a way that dangerous states are no
longer reachable, as illustrated in Fig. 2. As a consequence, it
would be guaranteed that any attack sequence affecting sensor
measurements or AGC setpoints cannot drive the system states
to dangerous states. These new resilient constraints may be
enforced by local controllers at each generation unit and ESS,
such that any AGC setpoint outside these bounds will be
saturated, making the system resilient to any cyber attack
affecting the AGC directly or indirectly. First, let us introduce
a mathematical formulation for the unsafe states set.

Deﬁnition 1 (Unsafe States): The set of unsafe states,
denoted as D, corresponds to those states that are dangerous
for the system operation and that need to be avoided. This
set can be captured as the union of half-spaces deﬁned by
hyperplanes of the form c(cid:62)

i x ≥ gi, such that

(8)

As an example, consider ∆f (k). Recall that the safety condi-
tion for frequency deviation is |∆f (k)| ≤ 0.2 Hz. In this case,
the unsafe states can be described by two hyperplanes with pa-
rameters c1 = [1, 0, . . . , 0], g1 = 0.2, and c2 = [−1, 0, . . . , 0]
and g2 = 0.2. The same formulation applies for all the states
of x.

The shortest distance between an ellipsoid E(W ) and each
i x ≥ gi is

hyperplane that characterize the unsafe states, c(cid:62)
given by [19]

dE,i =

|gi| − (cid:112)c(cid:62)
c(cid:62)ci

i W ci

.

(9)

Therefore, since our intent is to redesign the operating con-
straints in order to avoid dangerous states, we can formulate
an optimization problem to ﬁnd new constraints ˆγi such that
the distance dE,| between the ellipsoid and each hyperplane
is greater than zero for all j = 1, . . . , κ. This in turn will
guarantee that the unsafe states D and the new reachable set ˆR
do not overlap. The main result is introduced in the following
theorem.

Theorem 1 (Resilient Operating Constraints Design):
Consider the linear time-invariant (LTI) system (5) with
controllable pair (A, B) and a set of dangerous states
D deﬁned by (8). If A is Hurwitz stable, and if there
exists an a ∈ (0, 1) for which the positive deﬁnite matrix
W is a solution of the following convex optimization problem:

then the new operating bounds ˆγi, i = 1, ..., m, ensure that the
resulting reachable set ˆR does not intersect with the dangerous
states D, as depicted in Fig. 2(right).

Sketch of the proof: The proof consist of guaranteeing
that a positive deﬁnite function V (k) = x(k)(cid:62)W −1x(k) re-
mains bounded for all k, along the trajectories of the dynamic
system. This can be ensured if the following is satisﬁed:

is still maintained. The details of the proof are found in
Appendix A.

≤ 0, .

Remark 1: Theorem 1 contains an unknown parameter a
that enters nonlinearly with the variable W . To side-step the
nonlinearity that is caused by the products aW , it is possible
to perform a grid-search or bisection over the parameter “a,”
such that the optimization is repeated a number of times for
different values of a. The selected solution ˆRu corresponds to
the one with the largest (cid:80)m
l=1 ˆγl.

The solution of Theorem 1 maximizes each ˆγi to ensure
that the system without attack can still perform frequency
regulation. Since the optimization problem in (10) is convex
and solved ofﬂine, it is possible to ﬁnd resilient operating
constraints even for large numbers of controllable assets.
Even though the proposed solution does not affect the system
stability and guarantees safety, it could be possible that the
obtained constraints decrease the frequency regulation perfor-
mance (e.g., longer times to reach ∆f = 0) when compared
to the nominal case without resilient constraints, incurring
in additional operating costs. This may require the use of
incentives from system operators (e.g., transmission system
operator) so that the obtained resilient constraints are enforced
by local controllers of energy assets participating in frequency
regulation.

IV. CASE STUDY

In order to illustrate the viability of the proposed approach,
we consider a power system with a single area, two syn-
chronous generators, and two energy storage systems. It is
assumed that at t = 0 the frequency deviation starts at
∆f (0) = 0.1 Hz. The total external input corresponding to
the uncertainty caused by load changes and renewable energy
resources is unknown but bounded according to |∆PL −
∆PRES| ≤ 0.2 pu. Every τ = 2 seconds, the controller
receives the frequency measurements to compute the area
control error given by ACE(k) = −B∆f (k), such that

Three different types of attacks are considered:

1 Random AGC setpoint attack: an adversary is able to
replace all AGC setpoints sent to the generation and
energy storage units with random signals drawn from an
uniform distribution.

2 Optimal AGC setpoint attack: an adversary replaces all
AGC setpoints with an optimal sequence carefully de-
signed to maximize the frequency deviation after 50
iterations (100 seconds). The attack sequence is found
by solving the following optimization problem:

setpoints. The attack sequence is designed by solving the
following optimization problem:

A. Normal Operation

The optimal resilient constraints obtained by solving the
optimization problem in (10) are ˆγ = [0.1, 0.38, 0.2, 0.15].
Figure 3 illustrates the frequency deviation, unknown external
input ∆PL − ∆PRES, and the AGC response during 15 min
with the obtained resilient constraints. Notice that the AGC
is able to bring frequency deviations close to zero and the
controller actions are never saturated.

B. Attack Impact without Resilient Constraints

In order to illustrate the potential impact caused by mali-
cious attackers, let us consider the case without the resilient
constraints. Figure 4 depicts the projection of the ellipsoidal
reachable set approximation with respect to frequency devi-
ation ∆f and ∆Pg,1 with the original physical constraints.
The set of unsafe constraints corresponds to ∆f ≥ 0.2 Hz,
∆f ≤ −0.2 Hz. The state deviation caused by the three attack
scenarios is also depicted in Fig. 4, where 1.000 iterations of
the random attack were performed. Notice that the reachable
set overlaps the set of unsafe states such that there exist mul-
tiple attack sequences that can drive frequency deviations to
dangerous values. Figure 5 illustrates the frequency deviation
and AGC setpoints for the three attack scenarios. In particular,
the random AGC attack and the optimal AGC attack can
cause frequency deviation below −0.3 Hz, which surpasses
the safety limits.

Fig. 4. Reachable set without the proposed resilient constraints. Unsafe states
can be attained by multiple attack sequences.

C. Attack Impact With Resilient Constraints

The resilient reachable set is illustrated in Fig. 6 with the
three attacks introduced above. Notice that
the ellipsoidal
approximation does not overlap the unsafe states guaranteeing
that the frequency deviation remains within desired limits.
As a consequence, there does not exist any attack sequence
that can drive the system states to unsafe states. In fact, Fig.
7 illustrates that the optimal AGC attack can only cause a
frequency deviation up to −0.18 Hz and it requires a very
speciﬁc attack sequence. On the other hand, the optimal sensor
attack can only cause a maximum deviation of -0.08 Hz.

V. CONCLUSIONS

This paper presented a methodology that allows to compute
resilient operating constraints for generation units and energy
storage systems that guarantee that no attack affecting the
AGC setpoints directly or indirectly can drive the system
to unsafe states of operation. Typically, the computation of
these types of constraints becomes an NP-hard combinatorial
problem when the range of operation is continuous, forming a
bounded but inﬁnite set. However, the proposed methodology
uses ellipsoidal approximations to solve a convex optimization
problem with LMI constraints that ﬁnd the group of resilient
operating constraints based on the dynamic description of the
system and a deﬁned set of unsafe states. The simulation
results have shown that without resilient constraints it
is
possible for an attacker to design an attack sequence that
can drive the frequency deviation below 0.2 Hz. However,
by imposing the resilient constraints found with the proposed
methodology,
the resilient operation of the power system
with AGC control is guaranteed and the frequency deviation
remains within desired limits. In fact, there does not exist any
attack sequence that can force frequency deviations to violate
safety conditions. In addition, the obtained constraints do not

Notice that the condition in (11) is satisﬁed if J > 0. In
order to remove the inverse terms, it is possible to use a
mathematical tool named the Schur complement, which allows
to ﬁnd an equivalent matrix ˆJ , such that if ˆJ ≥ 0, it implies
that J ≥ 0.

Calculating the Schur complement to (11) leads to:

where

T =

results in the ﬁrst condition in (10). Therefore, if there exists
a positive deﬁnite matrix W , the reachable set is contained in-
side the ellipsoid x(cid:62)W −1x ≤ 1. The second constraint comes
from the distance dE,i deﬁned in (9). Therefore, dE,i ≥ 0 is
equivalent to |gi| − (cid:112)c(cid:62)

i W ci ≤ g2

which must hold for all the hyperplanes i = 1, . . . , κ.

APPENDIX A
PROOF THEOREM 1

In order to prove Theorem 1, it is necessary to restate the

following lemma adapted from [21].

Lemma 1: Let V (k) be a positive deﬁnite function, for k ∈
N where V (0) = 0. Let |ui,k| ≤ γi for i = 1, . . . , m denote
some bounded inputs. If there exists a constant a ∈ (0, 1) such
that the following holds,

V (k + 1) − aV (k) −

then V (k) ≤ 1 for all k.

Suppose

that we

with (5), we have that, if

then x(k)(cid:62)W −1x(k) ≤ 1. Let G = [B, H], ˆR =
diag(ˆγ1, . . . , ˆγm, γω), and (cid:101)u(k) = [u(k)(cid:62), ω(k)](cid:62). Therefore,
the inequality constraint can be rewritten in matrix form as
